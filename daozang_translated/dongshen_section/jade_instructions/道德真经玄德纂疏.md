**Preface to the Profound Virtue Commentary on the Dao De Jing**

The Dao is supreme and without form, yet it gives rise to wondrous existence.
It governs the boundless Dao, fulfilling the marvelous function of existence—
who else but the **Most High Sage-Laozi, the Primordial Emperor**?

Emerging from the **Symbolic Age** (象先), revered as the **Origin of Transformation** (化本),
He was the first to fuse the divine essence at the dawn of countless kalpas,
His spirit divided to permeate the heavens and earth, nurturing all beings,
Molding myriad forms, and refining all things.
Thus, the **Three Sovereigns** received their mandate,
Still adhering to the **Pure Unity** (淳一) of ancient virtue,
And the **Five Emperors** held the **Sacred Maps** (图),
Gradually dispersing the **Uncarved Simplicity** (无为之朴) of the Dao.

Though **Sage-Laozi** descended through the ages,
Adapting to each era’s needs—
Sometimes as a **national preceptor** (国师),
Sometimes as a **guest of honor** (宾友),
Teaching scriptures and transmitting the Dao,
To instruct the rulers of his time—
At the outset of the **Tang and Yu’s abdication** (唐虞禅让),
When the **Way of the world was in decline** (世道交丧),
He raised the **Primordial Virtue** (元凯) in the wilderness,
And practiced the **Four Offenses** (四罪) in court,
The **Veneration of Worthies** (尚贤) was manifest,
Yet the **Age of Corruption** (瘴恶) also emerged.
Though inner harmony was upheld,
Outer strife persisted—
Human hearts grew cold,
The **Uncarved Simplicity** of the Dao faded like mist.

**Sage-Laozi**, named **Yin Shouzi** (尹寿子),
Dwelling in **Helyang** (河阳),
Pitying the **erring nature of beings** (物性之迁讹),
Fearful that the **true teaching would be abandoned** (真宗之陵替),
Deemed that the **Great Scriptures of the Three Sovereigns** (三皇大字) were insufficient
To guide the **future kings** (后王),
And the **constant Way of the Five Emperors** (五帝常道) could not
Instruct the **later generations** (末俗).
Thus, he condensed the **profound and mysterious essence** (玄奥义),
Composing the *Dao De* in **two chapters**.
He sought to elucidate the **Dao’s non-action** (无为),
Using **virtue** (德) to reveal it—
**Virtue** has practical application,
The **Dao** clarifies its meaning.

He employed **spoken words** (立言) to express the **ineffable** (无言),
Using **principle** (理本) to expound the **mysterious origin** (妙本),
Establishing the **foundation for governance and self-cultivation** (理身理国之要),
As the **ultimate and most refined teaching** (至精至极之宗),
And bestowed it upon **Shun**.
Not that he rejected **benevolence, righteousness, sagely wisdom, and intelligence** (仁义圣智),
But rather, he tempered **excessive passion, deceit, and sharp cleverness** (浇诈聪明),
To guide the **sovereign to rule, ministers to serve, fathers to lead, and children to obey** (君君臣臣父父子子),
So they might **embrace the Uncarved and return to simplicity** (见素抱朴),
Merge with the **Great Harmony** (太和),
And thus naturally attain **loyalty and filial piety** (忠孝).

The **common scholars** (世儒) do not comprehend,
Assuming that **Sage-Laozi’s Dao** (老君之道) abandons
**Benevolence and righteousness** (仁义),
And **overthrows ritual and wisdom** (隳礼智),
This is not the **great principle of his teaching** (立教之大方).

Moreover, **supreme benevolence** (至仁) aligns with the **harmonious virtue of heaven and earth** (天地之德),
**Supreme righteousness** (至义) conforms to the **natural order of heaven and earth** (天地之宜),
**Supreme joy** (至乐) resonates with the **harmony of heaven and earth** (天地之和),
**Supreme propriety** (至礼) follows the **rhythms of heaven and earth** (天地之节),
**Supreme wisdom** (至智) discerns the **distinctions of heaven and earth** (天地之辨),
**Supreme trust** (至信) attunes to the **timing of heaven and earth** (天地之时).
It broadens the **source of Pure Unity** (淳一之源),
Achieves the **transformation of Great Unity** (大同之化),
Blends with the **supreme Dao** (混合至道),
And returns to the **Land of Benevolent Longevity** (归仁寿之乡).
It is not merely about **affected gestures or hollow rhetoric** (踶跂雍容，噢咻蹩趸),
But rather, it is **true benevolence and righteousness** (仁义等).

Thus, the **Sages Zhongni and Ya** (仲尼亚圣) all attained it in silence,
Discarding **cleverness** (黜聪) and **bodily form** (遗形),
Transcending the **material realm** (超乎物表),
And becoming **true immortals** (永为真人).
This is beyond the understanding of **petty scholars and minor literati** (末学小儒).

From the **Xia, Shang, Zhou, and Han dynasties** (绵夏商周汉),
Spanning thousands of years,
Its brilliance rivaled the **sun and moon** (与日月齐光),
Its majesty matched the **heavens and earth** (与乾坤并运).
Though **a hundred schools** (百家) have interpreted and annotated it,
And **numerous scholars** (群彦) have refined and elucidated it,
The more one draws from it, the deeper it becomes,
The more one tastes of it, the inexhaustible it is.
When applied to **governance**, punishments are set aside,
And **Great Peace** (太平) prevails.
When practiced in **self-cultivation**, the **spirit is preserved** (神全),
And **longevity is attained** (久视).

**Patting the table and brandishing the brush** (拊几挥柄),
There have always been those who embody its truth.

**Strong Contemplation (Strong Thinking)**, **Montang’s Qi Muyue** (强思齐，字默越),
A native of **Montang** (蒙阳),
From youth grasped the **Mysterious Passages** (玄关),
Early explored the **profound meanings** (妙旨),
Attending the **Golden Immortal Observatory** (京金仙观) each year,
Discussing the **Great Virtue** (大德) with his master,
Honored as a **Purple-Clad True Immortal** (赐紫全真),
Residing in the **Middle Palace of the Ge Immortal** (葛仙中宫),
After reciting scriptures, he **diligently served** (服勤不息),
His reputation flourishing,
Praised by his contemporaries.

When **Emperor Lizong** (僖宗皇帝) **responded to the auspicious signs** (顺动六飞),
And **halted his journey in the Three Shu regions** (驻跸三蜀),
In the **fifth month**, observing the **Celestial Festival** (应天节),
**Qi Muyue** composed a **prayer of longevity** (祝寿行殿),
And was **granted purple robes** (宠赐紫衣).

When **Emperor Gaozu** (高祖神武皇帝) **responded to the Heavenly Mandate** (应历开图),
And **aligned with the Celestial Pole** (配天立极),
In the **second month**, celebrating the **Spring Festival of Longevity** (寿春节),
He **received the clear command** (允承明命),
And bestowed the title **Profound Virtue Grandmaster** (玄德大师) upon him.
For generations, his **mind dwelled in the Dao** (栖心),
All were **granted radiant favor** (洽光宠),
His **feathered robes symbolized simplicity** (羽衣象简),
And his **virtue was unparalleled** (其何盛欤).

Whenever he **delved into the profound mysteries** (探讨幽玄),
And **expounded upon common understanding** (发挥流俗),
He aimed to **repay the sage’s grace** (报圣明之恩)
With the **power of his lectures** (谭讲之力).

In his **lectures on the *Dao De* in two chapters**,
He selected the **best interpretations of all schools** (采诸家之善者),
Taking **Emperor Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary** (皇《御注》) as the foundation,
Choosing **concise yet comprehensive expressions** (文约而义该),
**Swift yet logically sound words** (词捷而理当),
Compiling them into **twenty volumes** (勒成二十卷),
So that it might be **easily grasped** (揽之易晓),
And **endlessly transmitted** (传之无穷).
Thus, future scholars may **know the profound intent of this master** (知强君之深意).

Therefore, he titled it: *The Dao De Jing (True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue) with Profound Virtue Commentary by Sage-Laozi*.

On the **5th day of the 5th month, in the 2nd year of the Qian De era** (乾德二年庚辰降圣节戊申日),
**Master Guangcheng Du Guangting** (广成先生光禄大夫尚书户部侍郎上柱国蔡国公杜光庭),
**Grandee of the Purple Robes, Minister of the Household Department, and Duke of Cai** (光禄大夫尚书户部侍郎上柱国蔡国公),
Composed this preface.

**Volume One of the Profound Virtue Commentary on the Dao De Jing**

**Commentaries by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang (唐玄宗御注) and others**,
**Master Ge Shanggong’s and Yan Junping’s annotations (河上公严君平李荣注)**,
**Master Xihua’s and Cheng Xuanjing’s exegesis (西华法师成玄英疏)**,
**Montang’s Qi Muyue’s compilation (蒙阳强思齐纂)**.

This scripture is the **crown of the Three Teachings** (三教之冠冕),
The **leader of all scriptures** (众经之领袖),
Encompassing the **great without exclusion** (大无不包),
And the **small without omission** (细无不入),
Exhausting **principle** (穷理) and **essence** (尽性),
Beyond all **conceptual limits** (不可思议).
Thus, it is titled *The Dao De Jing (True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue)*.

The **Dao** is the **boundless realm of emptiness and flow** (虚通之理境),
**Virtue** is the **forgetful wisdom of profound insight** (志忘之妙智).
The **realm** can **awaken wisdom** (发智),
And **wisdom** can **subdue the realm** (克境).
When **realm and wisdom converge** (境智相会),
It is called *The Dao De Jing*.

Its **intricate and profound meanings** (委曲玄旨) are fully explained in the **opening preface** (开题义).
Now, examining the **upper chapter’s thirty-seven sections** (上卷三十七章),
They are divided into **three major categories**:
The first **one chapter** (第一一章) marks the **Dao’s fundamental essence** (标道宗致),
The second **thirty-five chapters** (第二三十五章) broadly expound the **Dao’s methods** (广明道法),
The third **one chapter** (第三一章) summarizes the **ultimate teaching** (总结指归).

Within this chapter, there are **four further distinctions**:
The first **briefly establishes principle and teaching** (略标理教),
The second **widely clarifies the original source** (泛明本边),
The third **contrasts the two perspectives** (显二观不同),
The fourth **unifies the profound essence of the Dao** (会重玄之致).

**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken"**

---

**First Distinction: Briefly Establishing Principle and Teaching**

The Great Dao is a boundless, mysterious principle beyond all forms. Its essence surpasses the grasp of symbols, and its operations arise from the unfathomable. It is not something that can be known by ordinary names, nor is it something that can be fully explored by mere speech. It encompasses all without exclusion, and it penetrates even the finest details—when it manifests, it rides upon the *Palm Boat* (慈舟) of compassion, and when it withdraws, it returns to the *Silent Obscurity* (杜默) of the unspoken. The Yellow Emperor fasted for three months before seeking it, yet Emperor Jing of the Former Han exhausted years without receiving an answer.

Its substance is serene, its name is subtle. Some ascend with the *Dragon Chariot* (龙轩) to wander the *Jade Capital* (玉京), while others harness the *Luan* (鸾) and *Zhī* (骖) to float at the *Golden Gates* (金阙). The Western Sovereign Mother obtained it and sat in the *Minor Broad* (少广), while Dongfang Shuo encountered it and played in the Han Court. Heaven and Earth obtained it and thus were able to bring forth creation, while the myriad beings blew with the ten thousand breaths and gave birth to life. Ah! The profound and boundless Dao—how vast it is!

The Dao that can be spoken is not the Dao beyond speech.

**Commentary by Yu** (御疏):
*"The Dao"* is a strong designation for the boundless, mysterious origin. *"By"* (训由) refers to the path of its operations, *"Law"* (训法) refers to its methods, and *"Constant"* (训常) refers to its enduring nature. The first character marks its essence, saying that this mysterious origin is the universal path through which all things arise, and thus it may be called *Dao*—hence, *"The Dao That Can Be Spoken."*

It can be called *Dao* because the scripture says: *"I do not know its name; I call it Dao."* This is to guide students in attaining clarity of nature and cultivating the mind, thus naming it *Dao*.

Seeking its mysterious origin, one finds that its principle is utterly clear and void, its nature is beyond comprehension—neither luminous nor obscure.

Again, referring to the following passage in the scripture: *"When seen, it is not seen—called *Yī* (夷); when heard, it is not heard—called *Xī* (希); when grasped, it is not obtained—called *Wēi* (微)."* The passage before it—*"When seen, it is not seen"*—refers to seeking the Dao through color, *"When heard, it is not heard"*—through sound, *"When grasped, it is not obtained"*—through form. Yet the mysterious Dao is too subtle and profound to be attained by worldly means of sound, color, or form.

Referring to the *"Scripture of the Nine Heavens Giving Birth to Spirits"* (九天生神经), it says: *"The Sage uses the Three Primordials of Mysterious Origin—*Sān Xī* (三熙)—as his substance, speaking of the Three Mysterious Primordials of the Three Heavens—*Sān Miào Xī* (三妙熙)."* Master Zang Zongdao further uses *"Three One"* (三一) as the Sage’s manifested body. The *"Three One"* refers to: one *Jīng* (精), two *Shén* (神), and three *Qì* (氣).

*Jīng* is the heart of luminous wisdom and intuitive intelligence. *Shén* is the faculty of boundless, unfathomable operation. *Qì* is the method of colors and forms.

The scripture says: *"When seen, it is not seen—called *Yī* (夷), the *Jīng*; when heard, it is not heard—called *Xī* (希), the *Shén*; when grasped, it is not obtained—called *Wēi* (微), the *Qì*."* These three methods are unified into one Sage, and the Sage embodies these three aspects without any contradiction—thus, they are merged into one.

But the *Dao*’s methods and substance are expressed through *"Three One"* (三一), which has distinctions between true and manifested. The interpretations of this vary among three schools:
The first says: *"Dissolving the One into Three"*—meaning the Sage’s manifested body merges the Three into One, which is the Sage’s true substance.
The second says: *"The Three and the One are both manifested; neither the Three nor the One is true. The Three and the One are merely names and numbers."*
The third asks: *"Is there a true substance beyond names and numbers, separate from the Three and the One?"*

It is said that *"Three One"* is not Three nor One—this is the true substance. *"Three One"* is neither Three nor One—this is the manifested body. The manifested body that is not *"Three One"* is the true manifested body, while the true substance that is *"Three One"* is the manifested true substance. The true substance of the manifested body cannot be definitively called true, nor can the manifested body of the true substance be definitively called manifested. Thus, it is neither true nor manifested, yet it is both manifested and true.

The Sage responds to stimuli and adapts to circumstances, manifesting in myriad forms—sometimes appearing in human guise, sometimes as a celestial being. He reveals himself according to the situation, and his transformations follow the times. His subtle essence is beyond *Yī* (夷) and *Xī* (希), yet it remains difficult to fully comprehend.

**Rong** (荣) says:
*The Dao* is the principle of boundless voidness, and its symbols cannot be divided by existence or nonexistence. Its true substance cannot be confined by the extremes of high or low. It is said to be mysterious yet beyond thought, profound yet beyond recognition.

The Sage lays bare this path of the mysterious, opening it as a teaching. He borrows the term *"Round and Pass Through"* (圆通) to designate the boundless voidness, calling it the principle that can be named, and thus the *Dao* that can be spoken. *"I do not know its name"*—the Sage achieves the Dao through boundless voidness, and its constant nature is attained through serene stillness. This is called the *"Boundless Great Dao"* (无极大道), which is the original nature of all beings.

What is the *Heavenly Dao*? It is the system of voidness, the root of transformation, the origin of divine illumination, and the source of Heaven and Earth. It is boundless without exclusion, subtle without interiority, vast without end, and profound without measure. Though it is the most hidden and obscure, its great light shines forth. Though it is utterly still without heart, the myriad things have their fixed places. It is mixed and indistinct without form, silent and empty without sound. Yet from it arise all phenomena, and from it are formed the five tones. That which is born has limits, that which is formed has deficiencies. Birth and formation, birth and formation—eternal and unchanging, from ancient times to the present. This is what is called *Dao*.

Before the *Primordial Qi* (元气) and the boundless voidness, there was serene stillness—what was there? When the most refined essence was stirred, the *True One* (真一) was born.

The *True One* moves with divine illumination, and thus the *Primordial Qi* transforms naturally. The *Primordial Qi* is the existence within nonexistence, the nonexistence within existence—vast beyond measure, subtle beyond detection. It gradually condenses and solidifies, becoming indistinct and formless, yet from it emerge the origins of all phenomena. Thus, the clear and luminous *Qi* (氣) ascends to form Heaven, while the turbid and obscured *Qi* gathers to form Earth. The harmonious and gentle *Qi* coalesces into human beings and their roles, while the chaotic and rigid *Qi* disperses into various other types.

From the single *Qi*’s nurturing, myriad differences are spread and classified. Once the mechanism of transformation is engaged, change is endless without limit. Yet the forms of Heaven, Earth, and all beings arise from the *Primordial Qi* (元氣). That which grants Heaven, Earth, and all beings their spirit is divine illumination. Thus, *Lián* (乾) and *Kūn* (坤) govern Heaven and Earth, while *Jīng* (精) and *Hún* (魂) oversee all beings.

*Qi* undergoes the revolutions of *Yīn* and *Yáng*, while divine illumination is unaffected by cold or heat. Though all things move in confusion beyond count, they perish only to be reborn, end only to begin anew. Yet the body of *Dao* and *Virtue* (德), the divine illumination of the mind, respond to stimuli endlessly without ever being exhausted by the realm of motion and operation.

「The Dao/Way is profound yet encompasses the ten millionfold Heaven without making it vast, penetrates the finest autumn hair without making it small. It precedes the void and formlessness yet is not the beginning, succeeds Heaven and Earth yet is not their end. It ascends to the accumulation of Yang without becoming luminous, descends into the depths of Yin without becoming obscure.

Originally, there is no *spirit* (神). At the utmost void, spirit emerges. Originally, there is no *Qi* (炁). Through the movement of spirit, Qi transforms. Without foundation or substance, it condenses and coalesces to form shape; shape, originally without *emotion* (情), is diminished by motion and operation.

As form takes shape and nature moves, the Dao/Way grows ever more distant. Thus, one is lost in birth and death, shifting between Yin and Yang, unable to halt oneself—this is not because the Dao/Way is forgotten while existing, but because it can cause the existent to return to the nonexistent.

Hence, the Dao/Way is able to generate existence from nonexistence; how much more can it make the existent conform to the nonexistent! If the existent conforms to the nonexistent, then existence will not perish. Therefore, the Dao/Way gives birth to me, yet passion destroys me. If one forgets passion, then nature is preserved intact. When nature is whole, form is whole; when form is whole, Qi is whole; when Qi is refined, spirit is whole; when spirit is whole, the Dao/Way is whole. Thus, when the Dao/Way is complete, spirit reigns supreme; when spirit reigns, Qi becomes responsive; when Qi is responsive, form transcends; when form transcends, nature is fully realized. Those who fully realize nature return and circulate endlessly, merging with the Dao/Way.

It can make the existent nonexistent, can make the void substantial. I shall align myself with the Creator and let birth and death fail to burden me.

The Dao/Way can be spoken of as *substance* (體), and named as *function* (用). That which can be spoken of is but the Dao/Way’s manifestation. Though it may be called "speakable," things adapt to their circumstances, giving rise to sound and speech—this is not the Dao/Way of eternal stillness and repose.

○ **Yán** (嚴) says: When *Dao/Virtue* (道德) is manifest, it is not natural. When fame and achievement are displayed, it is not true essence.
○ **Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) says: That which can be spoken of is not the Dao/Way of natural longevity.

The Dao/Way of constancy should cultivate the nonexistent to nourish the spirit, remain without affairs to settle the people, contain light and conceal brilliance, erase traces and obscure origins—it cannot be named.

○ **Róng** (榮) says: This is not the Dao/Way of humans honoring through rites and propriety, elevating through superficial splendor, losing themselves to gain fame, forgetting themselves to serve profit. They abandon the Dao/Way and follow Virtue (德) thereafter; this teaching now prevails. But having stripped away the trappings of benevolence and righteousness, taking the essence of Dao/Virtue, and returning to the source of purity and simplicity, one reverses their constant passions. Hence, it is called the Dao/Way of constancy.

○ **Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏): The Dao/Way of constancy cannot be defined by words or reasoned through the mind; it transcends subtlety and eludes the grasp of logic. Thus, knowing beyond words and symbols, one may then conform to the eternal stillness—what can be spoken of and named is not the Dao/Way of constancy.

That which can be named is not the Dao/Way’s true name.
○ **Yù Zhù** (御注): Names are the Dao/Way’s designations. I forcefully name it the *Great* (大).

Names do not stand alone; they arise from substance. Words do not exist in isolation; they are established by Virtue (德). The operation of principles and substance flows without obstruction, encompassing all to reach the boundless. Thus, I name the Dao/Way’s *Great* (大) designation to the Dao/Way’s substance, so that things may recognize it—hence, "that which can be named is named."

○ **Yù’s Commentary** (御疏): Names are teachings. Earlier, it was said that what can be spoken of is manifest in principle; now, it is said that what can be named is secondary in teaching. True principle transcends words and symbols, and even teachings surpass verbal articulation.

Since principle is the Dao/Way of constancy yet cannot be spoken of, and teaching is that which can be named yet not the Dao/Way’s true name, one who seeks to clarify principle and teaching finds they are neither one nor different.

Yet the supreme Dao/Way is profound and mysterious, beyond measure or limit. It is neither nonexistent nor existent, neither fixed nor constant—though it is not constant, there is still uplift and subsidence. Teaching exists in gradual and sudden stages; thus, constancy is established to break the speakable, hence the statement that the speakable Dao/Way is not the Dao/Way of constancy.

At the extreme of discourse, there is neither "can" nor "cannot," nor is it the Dao/Way of constancy and non-constancy. Hence, the *Jùjīng Jīng* (玉京经) says: *"Without can or cannot, ponder with the subtle and minute."* That which can be named is not the vulgar honor of transient fame, so it is rejected as "not the Dao/Way of constancy," desiring one to abandon the impermanent and return to the eternal constancy.

There are causes of transcendence and stages of gradual and sudden enlightenment. Opening with the square, one picks up the impermanent; to grasp the eternal constancy, one must go beyond the square. Presenting it to its ultimate, there is no impermanent to be picked up, nor any eternal constancy to be taken—how much more so is the Dao/Way neither the impermanent nor the eternal constancy, nor is it the Dao/Way of the non-eternal constancy nor the Dao/Way of the eternal constancy!

○ **Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) says: It is not the name of the Dao/Way that is naturally ever-present.

The name of constancy should be like an infant before speech, a chicken egg before division, a bright pearl within the shell, or a fine jade hidden in stone—internally luminous, externally dull. The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the Dao/Way of constancy; that which can be named is not the Dao/Way’s true name.

The second passage clarifies the original traces.
The nonexistent is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The existent is the mother of all things.

○ **Yù Zhù** (御注): The nonexistent is the mysterious origin. The mysterious origin reveals itself in Qi, temporarily manifesting as Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth derive their beginning, so the nonexistent is called the beginning. The existent is the response to application.

○ **Róng** (榮) says: The Dao/Way is profound, its Virtue (德) subtle. Principle transcends existence and nonexistence. Since existence and nonexistence are transcended, names are discarded. Yet the function of void and emptiness is limitless—how can it not be nonexistent while being nonexistent? Thus, the nonexistent is the beginning of the two principles (兩儀). The existent, though not truly existent, is the mother of all things.

Hence, the Dao/Way generates and accumulates Virtue (德)—this is what is meant.

○ **Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏): This nonexistent is the origin of all things. The Dao/Way originally has no name, thus it is known that it cannot be spoken of or explained. The existent is the mother of all things, as it is described. The Dao/Way of *Double Mystery* (重玄) originally has no name; descending from the origin to traces, names and designations arise. Thus, the sage establishes the existent from the nonexistent, entrusting the existent to elucidate the nonexistent, desiring to nurture all beings and lead them back to their origin. With compassion and mercy, they cultivate and nourish, akin to a mother’s care.

○ **Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) says: The nonexistent is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The nonexistent is the Dao/Way, for the Dao/Way has no form and thus cannot be named.»

「The origin is where the Dao/Way emits *qi* and spreads its transformations, arising from the void and nonexistent, marking the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The existent, named as the mother of all things, refers to Heaven and Earth—Heaven and Earth possess form and position, and *yin* and *yang* exhibit softness and rigidity; thus, they are called by name.

The mother of all things is Heaven and Earth, which combine in harmony to generate all things, nurturing them to growth, maturity, and fulfillment, as a mother raises her children. The third realm manifests two distinct perspectives.

To observe its subtlety, one must habitually be without desire; to perceive its intricacies, one must habitually indulge desire.

○ **御注** (Imperial Annotation): When a person is born and remains tranquil, it reflects the nature of Heaven. When they respond to things and move, it is the stirrings of their innate desires. If one can perpetually uphold purity and stillness, free the mind and release the spirit, and return to reflect upon their original nature, then they can observe the wondrous origin. If one does not still their emotions, but instead pursues desires and moves with them, their nature is lost to desire, and they become bewildered at the source of the Dao/Way. If they then seek to observe the wondrous origin, they will only perceive its marginal subtleties.

○ **御疏** (Imperial Commentary): To habitually be without desire means to uphold the law-nature of purity and stillness, detached from speech and thought, with no lingering attachments—thus, one perceives the Dao/Way’s most subtle and wondrous essence. To habitually indulge desire is to rise from the origin and act, establishing teachings through speech, adapting to things and achieving harmony, transforming the world—thus, one perceives the convergence of all beings.

○ **缴** (return) is to **归** (return).

○ **严** (Yan) says: To be without desire is to gaze beyond all gazing. To observe its subtlety is to peer into the *Taiqing* (Great Clarity).

○ **荣** (Rong) illuminates the distinction between desire and non-desire: When a person receives life, all are endowed with their beginning by virtue and the Dao/Way, sharing the same breath of *qi* from *yin* and *yang*, yet differing in their luminous and obscure spirits, their tranquil and restless natures. To walk without desire is to smooth the heart and traverse the silent path, to purify the will and ford the mysterious depths—when desires are insufficient to disturb the spirit, and distractions cannot slip the mind, the luminous platform is serene and cold, the mysterious mirror deep and clear. Then one can perceive the marginal subtleties and grasp the wondrous essence; this is the way of non-desire.

The way of desire, if one cannot yet abandon recognition, when emotions are bound within form and roam through the body, is not merely agitation over sounds and colors, but to adhere to the affairs of the existent—how does one recognize the principles of the nonexistent? This is the way of desire.

○ **河上公** (Hé Shànggōng) says: To habitually be without desire and observe its subtlety, for subtlety is the essence. When a person habitually remains without desire, they can observe the Dao/Way’s essence. The essence is oneness—from this oneness, names and transformations are emitted, and the Dao/Way is praised. This is the Master who discerns right and wrong.

○ **成疏** (Chéng’s Commentary): **缴** (return) is to **归** (return). Desire is the entanglement of emotions. **所** (that which) is the realm.»

「Though one cannot act without *for* [事], nor remain tranquil and unadorned, yet observing the Dao/Way’s subtlety and upholding its truth—when false stirrings arise in hunger and seeking, when emotions run wild and cling to stagnation—this is but the sight of the world’s *for* [有], failing to grasp that *for* [有] is empty. Thus, one cannot perceive the Dao/Way’s profound principles, seeing only the fate of life and death. This earlier distinction of nameless and named *virtue/power* [名] now reveals the triumph of desireless over desireful conduct.

The Fourth Assembly expounds the *Dao/Way’s* ultimate subtlety. These two—though sharing the same origin, differing only in name—
○ **御注** [Imperial Commentary]: As with the two above, both arise from the Dao/Way, hence they are called the same.
From movement comes application; names are established according to use, hence their difference.

○ **御疏** [Imperial Exegesis]: Both derive from the same subtle source, thus they are identical in origin. Names differ as they are applied to distinct uses.

○ **河上公** (Hé Shànggōng) says: Desireful and desireless conduct both originate from the human heart. Desireless conduct endures, while desireful conduct consumes the self—thus their difference.

○ **荣** (Róng) says: In close terms, these two—desireful and desireless—refer to humanity. All share the five constant essences [五常], all possess the same *innate mind* [方寸之心], hence their sameness.
To reject clarity and remain tranquil, penetrating the Dao/Way’s source, is to attain the *subtle* [妙]. To be ensnared by perceptions before understanding, lost in mundane affairs, is to fall into *entanglement* [缴]. This is their divergence in name.

In broader terms, the Sage seeks to fulfill the Dao/Way’s clear and empty principles, thus taking *virtue/power* [道德] as their core. Hence, this chapter emphasizes their duality—*virtue/power* [道德] and *virtue/power* [道德]—while the Dao/Way’s essence remains unified. Thus, they are called the same.
The *Dao/Way’s* essence, arising from stillness, is hence termed *out* [出]. Its transformative function is the Dao/Way itself; its nurturing principle is the manifestation of *virtue/power* [德]. Thus, the Dao/Way’s names differ.

○ **成疏** (Chéng’s Commentary): Though these two share the same origin, differing only in name—*entanglement* [缴] and *subtle* [妙]—the observed realm is singular, yet the capacity to observe varies. Since the two modes of observation differ, *entanglement* [缴] and *subtle* [妙] are named distinctively.
This is called the *Dao/Way’s* ultimate subtlety [玄].

○ **御注** [Imperial Commentary]: When spoken of as *out* [出], their names differ; when spoken of as the same, it is called the *Dao/Way’s* ultimate subtlety [玄], which is profound and subtle.

○ **河上公** (Hé Shànggōng) says: *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] is the heavens. It states that those with desireful or desireless conduct all receive *qi* [气] from the heavens.

○ **荣** (Róng) says: The Dao/Way of emptiness and stillness, the *virtue/power* [德] of profound subtlety—its elusive nature is not easily grasped, its silent mystery not easily spoken of. No name can suffice.
The term *ultimate subtlety* [玄] is borrowed to signify the same, for the Dao/Way’s subtlety is ineffable. Only the Dao/Way and *virtue/power* [德] can convey *ultimate subtlety* [玄], hence it is said: *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] is profound and distant, the Dao/Way is supremely subtle and still.

○ **御疏** [Imperial Exegesis]: When spoken of as *out* [出], their names differ—this is the progression from origin to application.
When spoken of as the same, it signifies profound subtlety—this is the return to the source, transcending all dualities.
To return to the source is to attain profound subtlety, hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄].

○ **成疏** (Chéng’s Commentary): *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] means profound and distant, also the name for non-stagnation. The twofold heart of desireful and desireless conduct, both modes of observing *entanglement* [缴] and *subtle* [妙], originate from the same Dao/Way, differing only in name.
The Dao/Way, though named differently, is profound and distant. Its principle returns to non-stagnation.
Neither stagnating in existence nor in non-existence, both are transcended—hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄].
*Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄], is the gateway to all subtleties.

○ **御注** [Imperial Commentary]: Since the mind does not generate, it aligns with the profound subtlety. Yet fearing that *ultimate subtlety* [玄] might be taken as stagnation, it further dismisses the notion of attachment, demonstrating that desireless conduct transcends desire. Those who attain this understand all *dharma* [法], hence it is called the gateway to all subtleties.

○ **河上公** (Hé Shànggōng) says: *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄] is the heavens within the heavens. Those who receive *qi* [气] with varying depths—if they attain the harmony of *central equilibrium* [中和] and pure nourishment, they become sages and worthy. If they fall into disorder and impurity, they become nobles of licentiousness.
The gateway to all subtleties is to know that the heavens contain another heavens, that *qi* [气] has varying depths, and to eliminate emotions and desires while guarding *central equilibrium* [中和]. This is the gateway to understanding the Dao/Way’s essence.

○ **荣** (Róng) says: *Virtue/power* [道德] is elusive and profound, its principles surpassing all speech and forms. Its true essence is tranquil and vast, its affairs transcending existence and non-existence. Borrowing terms beyond speech and forms, beyond existence and non-existence, to illuminate the Dao/Way’s hidden path—hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄].
Yet one might fear that those lost in duality cling to the pillar, or those who abandon principle guard the stump. Thus, to fix *ultimate subtlety* [玄] as the true Dao/Way is incorrect. Therefore, it is further stated: it is not the fixed name of existence or non-existence.
Using *ultimate subtlety* [玄] to dismiss existence and non-existence, once existence and non-existence are dismissed, *ultimate subtlety* [玄] itself is lost—hence it is said: *ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄].
*Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄] is beyond threefold reversal and fourfold phrasing. It is boundless and open, unimpeded by emptiness, encompassing all phenomena’s pivotal essence and unlocking the hundredfold gates of wisdom. Those who reach this state—all subtleties’ gateway.

○ **御疏** [Imperial Exegesis]: The *Scripture of Western Ascension* [西升经] states: "Same origin, differing names, each generates its own *emotional causes* [意因]."
Now, without generating *emotional causes* [意因], it is identical with profound subtlety.
Desireless conduct in desirelessness—desirelessness is the *emotional cause* [意因] for desire. Hence, one seeks desirelessness.
To seek desirelessness while still clinging to desire is not yet free. Now, having no desire, there is no gateway either.
○ **成疏** (Chéng’s Commentary): *Ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄]—for those with desire, desirelessness is the dismissal of attachment again and again, until all is forgotten.
True observation, such as this, is the attainment of all subtleties.
Though subtleties are many, they all originate from this—yet one stagnates in existence, while the desireless person stagnates in non-existence. Hence, it speaks of *ultimate subtlety* [玄] to dismiss both attachments.
Again, fearing that scholars might stagnate in this *ultimate subtlety* [玄], it further speaks of *ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄], to further alleviate the lingering affliction.
Not only does it not stagnate, but it also transcends non-stagnation—this is the dismissal of attachment again and again, hence it is called *ultimate subtlety* [玄] beyond *ultimate subtlety* [玄].
The gateway to all subtleties—*subtlety* [妙] refers to the essential subtlety, *gateway* [门] is the *dharma gate* [法门].
Earlier, the profound subtlety of central unity dismissed the duality of both categories. Once the dual afflictions are removed, the profound subtlety’s medicine is further dismissed. Thus, medicine and affliction vanish simultaneously—this is the ultimate subtlety, the pinnacle of profound principles, exhausting all reason and nature. It is not merely the door to sages, but also the gateway to all subtleties.»

「**The World All Knows Beauty as Beauty, the Second Chapter**
This chapter follows the previous one because the earlier chapter elucidates the two views of existence and non-existence [有无二观], with their coarse and subtle distinctions. Therefore, this chapter reveals the efficacy of the *non-action* [无为] and the perils of *action* [有为], dividing its meaning into two parts: the first clarifies the common attachments and stagnations that give rise to confusion and delusion, while the second demonstrates the *sage’s wisdom* [圣智] in its emptiness and clarity, as it forgets merit and aids beings without self-interest.

**First: Clarifying the Common Attachments and Stagnations That Give Rise to Delusion**
Within this chapter, two further distinctions are made: the first two sentences broadly refute the illusory nature of beauty and goodness [美善], while the remaining six sentences, in three pairs, illuminate the emptiness of all phenomena [诸法无实].

**First: Broadly Refuting the Illusory Nature of Beauty and Goodness**
The ordinary folk of the world are ensnared by sounds and colors, bound by *action* [有为], never finding true repose. They chase fame and profit like monkeys leaping from branch to branch, indulge in love and desire like moths drawn to flame. They confuse evil for good, regard ease as difficulty, and dwell in the nameless void of ignorance, clinging stubbornly to their fragile, perilous selves. How could they comprehend the *subtle Dao* [妙道] in its emptiness and fluidity, the true words and rational sequence, when its brilliance and obscurity defy explanation, and its acceptance is blind? The Seven Sages [七圣] lost their way at Xiangcheng, and Xizi spoke in vain at Hengshan. Sounds and colors fade into nothingness, and the distinction between self and other dissolves into emptiness. Only by abandoning the flawed body of *existence with defilements* [有漏] can one align with the *non-action Dao* [无为之道].

The world all knows beauty as beauty—then evil arises.
The world all knows goodness as goodness—then what is not good arises.

**Commentary by the Master:**
Beauty and goodness arise from desire [欲心]. When desire dictates what is beautiful or good, even what is evil becomes beautiful or good—hence, "the world all knows." One takes what pleases their own desires as beautiful or good, but beauty and goodness have no inherent master; they are merely deluded emotions, born from clinging to distinctions of existence and non-existence, ease and difficulty, the wondrous and the foul—each falsely usurping the other.

The Great Sage discerns this emptiness and delusion, thus declaring, "Then evil arises."

**Commentary from the *Riverbank Master* [河上公]:**
When the world all knows beauty as beauty, it is merely self-praise, making it appear radiant.

"Then evil arises"—this means peril and ruin are imminent.
When the world all knows goodness as goodness, it implies a demand for merit and reward—then what is not good arises, and people vie for it.

**Commentary by Yan [严]:**
Human cleverness can be cut off but not dispersed; human desires can be resisted but not reversed. Adorning one’s appearance harms one’s nature, and gratifying desire shortens one’s life. The world’s so-called "beauty and goodness" are not the utmost beauty or goodness.

True beauty is not what the world can see, and true goodness is not what the world can know.

**Commentary by Rong [荣]:**
Beauty is pleasure.
All people, by their inherent nature, cannot find joy in the Dao but instead take glory as pleasure. Pleasure cannot be boundless—when pushed to extremes, sorrow follows. Desire cannot be indulged recklessly—when unrestrained, it leads to ruin. Hence, people take sounds, colors, flavors, and tastes as supreme pleasure, unaware of how these very things bring great calamity.

When simplicity [朴] becomes a curse, when simplicity is lost, sorrow arises. When the root is extinguished, nature is harmed, and the body falls into ruin.

The world all knows goodness as goodness—then what is not good arises.

From the highest to the lowest, the noble and the vulgar, none can truly empty their minds and selves, yet all indulge their desires and emotions. Though their affections differ, each follows their nature and shares the same attachments.

Those who love fame regard fame as goodness; those who love profit regard profit as goodness. If one pursues profit without the proper means, or clings to fame to the point of self-destruction, then goodness becomes ruinous.

Though conforming to desire may seem good, it leads to self-destruction—this is true evil. Hence, Boyi perished for fame atop Mount Shouyang, while Zhi the Thief died for profit beneath the Eastern Ling. This is what is not good.

*The world* [世问] is a general term for the worldly realm.
*The world* [世问] refers to all beings between the heavens and the earth, those who are immersed in dusty illusions and falsely cling to beauty and evil. Those who oppose their true nature stir hatred—this is called evil. Those who follow their deluded intentions breed attachment—this is called beauty.

Not knowing that all phenomena are both *existent* [有] and *empty* [空], when beauty and evil are seen as empty, why cling to hatred or love?

Thus, the *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Maoqiang and Xishi are what people call beautiful, but fish see them as deep and dark, and birds see them as high and lofty."*

It also says:
*"The beautiful praise themselves as beautiful—I do not know their beauty.*
*The evil condemn themselves as evil—I do not know their evil."*

By this, it is proven that beauty and evil are mere illusions. Hence, one who clings to worldly beauty as true beauty knows only evil, and one who clings to worldly goodness as true goodness knows only what is not good.

The vulgar masses, lost in delusion, do not merely indulge in sounds and colors but also fixate on reputation, seeking fame even at the cost of their lives, harming others for personal gain. They do not realize that goodness is an empty, delusive notion—hence, the following passage asks: *Which is closer to one’s self, fame or the body?*

The *Zhuangzi* says:
*"To do good without seeking fame is near,"*
and also:
*"What they prize and cherish are none other than fame and goodness."*

Thus, it is clear that clinging to fame and goodness contradicts true principle. Only by forgetting goodness and evil and attaining the *central equilibrium* [居中] can one truly embody the *non-action Dao* [无为之致].

**Second: Illuminating the Emptiness of All Phenomena**
Thus, *existence* [有] and *non-existence* [无] give rise to each other.

**Commentary from the *Riverbank Master*:**
To perceive *existence* [有] as *non-existence* [无]—this is the nature of emptiness.

**Commentary by Rong:**
All things arise from *existence* [有], and *existence* [有] arises from *non-existence* [无]. From *non-existence* [无] comes *existence* [有], and from *existence* [有] returns *non-existence* [无]—hence, they give rise to each other.

Difficulty and ease [难易] complete one another...»

Thus, the *Riverbank Master*’s commentary states: *"The dharma is empty; the potter finds ease in shaping clay but struggles with wood, while the artisan finds ease in carving wood but struggles with clay."* ○ **Yán** says: *"Difficulty is revealed through ease, and ease is illuminated by difficulty; without skill, one cannot discern ease, and without ease, one cannot grasp difficulty. If one can skillfully abandon both, then the names of difficulty and ease both cease."* ○ The *Riverbank Master* says: *"To perceive difficulty as ease."* ○ **Róng** says: *"All things under heaven arise from difficulty as ease, difficulty springs from ease, and ease fulfills difficulty. Ease emerges from difficulty, and difficulty becomes ease."*

The *Master Cheng*’s commentary states: *"The mind of emptiness and the view of harmony—without ease or difficulty, distinctions arise from attachment. With attachment to difficulty or ease, then difficulty and ease both manifest. Thus, it is known that the two dharmas of difficulty and ease interdependently arise."*

Length and shortness mutually define each other. The *Riverbank Master*’s commentary states: *"They are empty in nature."* ○ **Yán** says: *"An inch is short when measured by a foot, a foot is long when measured by an inch. Without length, one cannot clarify shortness; without shortness, one cannot discern length. Length and shortness are empty—they have no inherent reality—hence, they are called empty."*

○ The *Riverbank Master* says: *"To perceive shortness as length."* ○ **Róng** says: *"When separated, there is neither great nor small; when gathered, there is short and long. The Great Mountain and the autumn hair differ in magnitude, the White Crane and the Green Hare diverge in span—thus, it is known that forgetting them yields neither great nor small, while retaining them reveals short and long."*

○ The *Master Cheng*’s commentary states: *"Measuring length by length, there is no length; comparing shortness with shortness, there is no shortness—thus, it is known that length and shortness mutually define each other and differ."*

Height and lowliness mutually incline. The *Riverbank Master*’s commentary states: *"They are empty in name."* ○ **Yán** says: *"Mountains are diminished by valleys, valleys are tilted by mountains. Without mountains, one cannot know valleys; without valleys, one cannot know mountains. Like worldly status shifting between master and servant, there is no fixed position."* ○ The *Riverbank Master* says: *"To perceive height as lowliness."* ○ **Róng** says: *"Incline, means peril. Water sustains boats yet also capsizes them; the scriptures say: 'The high becomes the foundation for the low, the low becomes perilous to the high.' The lowliness of the low is still perilous to the high, and the nobility of the high is indeed capable of extinguishing the low. Losing the Dao, height and lowliness become perilous; attaining the Dao, ruler and subject both flourish. Incline, means to topple and seize—where there is height, there is lowliness; without lowliness, there is no height. For instance, a foot measured against an inch is high, while the same foot measured against a yard is low. What was once high becomes now low—thus, it is known that height and lowliness have no fixed reality, only mutual incline and seizure, hence all are empty."*

Sound and voice harmonize together. The *Riverbank Master*’s commentary states: *"This illustrates the emptiness of harmony and unity."*

Who shapes the harmony of the five tones? The *Riverbank Master* says: *"The tones are distinguished by voice, and voice is measured by tone. Without tone, there is no way to know voice; without voice, there is no way to know tone."*

The *Master of Strictness* responds: *"The high sings, the low responds with harmony."*

**Daoist Classic of the Mysterious Virtue: *Zhenjing* (True Scripture) – Imperial Commentary and Exegesis by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang, with annotations by Master Riverbank, Master Yan, Master Li, and Master Cheng**

**Chapter 5: "Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent"**
This chapter follows the previous one because the prior chapter expounded the Dao of emptiness and mystery, transcending all phenomena before their manifestation. Thus, this chapter reveals the principle of forgetting merit, where the Sage aligns with the two primal forces (*Yin* and *Yang*) in virtue.

Within this chapter, three themes unfold:
1. The Sage and Heaven and Earth, acting without attachment to merit,
2. The analogy of the uncarved block (*su* – raw) and the empty vessel (*qiao* – hollow), illustrating the subtle efficacy of the Dao,
3. The critique of excessive knowledge and learning, which pale in comparison to attaining the Dao’s truth.

**1. The Sage and Heaven and Earth, acting without attachment to merit.**
From the single breath of *Qi*, the two primal forces are shaped—*Yin* and *Yang* divide and settle: Heaven, round and clear, covers above; Earth, square and turbid, condenses below. Both owe their existence to the great Dao, sharing the same observation of *Yin-Yang Qi*. Why does *Nuwa* speak of refining stone to prop up Heaven? Why does *Kuafu* die at the banks of the River? Why does *Zhuiyi* walk endlessly without reaching the end? Why does *Qinmi* gaze without limit? Heaven and Earth show no favor, treating all things as mere *chúdǒu*—sacrificial straw-dogs. The vast *Tianhan* (Heavenly River) flows without regard for distance; the distant *Héyuán* (River’s Source) vanishes without measure. *Zhang Qian* could not fathom its length—compared to the uncarved block, only material form is seen; likened to the empty vessel, no sound of exhaustion is heard. The Dao of Heaven turns in its cycles—how could it be called benevolent?

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as *chúdǒu*.
The Sage is not benevolent; he treats the people as *chúdǒu*.
**Imperial Commentary:** *"Not benevolent"* means they do not act with benevolent favor.
*"Chúdǒu"* refers to straw bound into the shape of a dog, used in sacrifices. Dogs, by nature, guard and bark—thus, they receive the protection of a roof. But the *chúdǒu* is merely a dog in form, lacking the true function of barking and guarding. Hence, it is said to have no genuine connection to benevolence or love. It is as if Heaven and Earth regard humanity no differently than they regard straw-dogs—expecting no gratitude in return.

**Reflection:** If supreme benevolence has no favorites, who then embodies universal love? Love that is not supreme is merely partial. If one does not love only their own kin, then all under Heaven are kin. If one does not consider only their own children, then all under Heaven are children. Thus, supreme benevolence’s lack of partiality is in truth the most inclusive love.

**Imperial Exegesis:** *"Benevolence"* is the name given to universal love. *Chú* means straw; the straw-dog is formed by binding straw into a dog’s shape for sacrificial use. *Zhuangzi* states: *"Before the straw-dog is offered in sacrifice, it is adorned with fine embroidery. Once the ritual is complete, it is discarded, and even its ashes are used for fuel."* Heaven and Earth, in their supreme benevolence, give rise to all beings, just as humans bind straw into a dog’s form—expecting no barking or guarding in return. They do not regard the act of creation as benevolent favor, hence they are called *"not benevolent."*

The Sage, in pardoning the world, views the people likewise—no expectations, no demands.

**Annotation by Master Yan:** *"Heaven, by its height, is clear and bright; Earth, by its depth, is moist and tranquil. *Yin* and *Yang* interact, and harmonious *Qi* flows. Thus, all things arise naturally without contrivance—Heaven and Earth do not labor with their hearts to show benevolence. The Sage upholds the Dao and harmonizes with it, remaining serene and unchanging, adapting to all transformations with divine insight. Aligned with the Dao’s ways, the world responds, and all things transform spontaneously. Does this not free one from anxious deliberation, revealing the true nature of benevolence?"*

**Annotation by Master Li:** *"Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as *chúdǒu*. Long and short, right and wrong—all are natural distinctions. Benevolence is love. Where there is love, there is also hatred. Heaven and Earth act without intent, transcending love and hatred. Because they are without love, they are called ‘not benevolent.’ The straw-dog is merely straw shaped like a dog; in ancient rituals, it was used in offerings, then discarded. It is said that the straw-dog is not loved when used, nor hated when discarded—an analogy for Heaven and Earth’s warmth like spring *Qi* naturally flowing, where creation is not seen as benevolence, nor destruction as righteousness. The Sage is not benevolent; he treats the people as *chúdǒu*. The Sage acts without intent, aligning with Heaven and Earth’s virtue. The meaning of ‘not benevolent’ and ‘straw-dog’ is now clear.*

Though their grace extends to grass and trees, their blessings reach even the *zhūyú* (fish and turtles), their winds and teachings precede humanity—yet still, they are called ‘people’ in this context."

**Exegesis by Master Cheng:** *"Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as *chúdǒu*. Benevolence is favor; the straw-dog is a hollow imitation of a dog. *Zhuangzi* says: ‘The discarded straw-dog is still round and domed above, square and firm below—just as *Yin* and *Yang* cover and load all beings, nurturing them with care. Yet, it is said they have no benevolence because they regard all things as one straw-dog.’ What is the straw-dog? It is merely a dog in name, not in reality. How much more so for all phenomena, which are equally hollow and empty—none deserving the expectation of gratitude or return!"*

The Sage is not benevolent,
treating the people as a straw-dog.
The Sage, in harmony with Heaven and Earth,
shares their virtue and aligns with the Sun and Moon in luminosity,
thus able to empty the heart for the benefit of all,
whose deeds rival the creative transformation.
Hence, first the *Yin* and *Yang* are raised,
then the Sage is revealed;
the Sage, though detached, rescues the teeming masses,
yet still, no transformation is seen—
what is transformed is but a straw-dog,
hollow and empty, without substance.
The *Yin* and *Yang* encompass all sentient beings,
so all things are called ‘the people’;
the Sage’s intent lies in the *rúqì* (compassionate beings),
thus the term ‘people’ is used.

It is not that the Sage fails to transform the unknowing,
but rather that the knowing can perceive and follow the teachings.

**Secondly, the analogy of the *tǔqiào* (leather bellows and reed pipe) is given,
to illustrate the subtle efficacy.**

Between Heaven and Earth—
is it not like the *tǔqiào*?
**Master Yu’s annotation:** *Tǔ*, like *wǎ* (leather pouch), *qiào*, like *dí* (reed pipe).
The bellows’ wind and the pipe’s breath,
both rely on emptiness and lack of intention,
thus motion yields response.

So too, between Heaven and Earth,
the nurturing of all beings without partiality
arises from their emptiness and lack of intention.

**Master Yu’s exegesis:** Between Heaven and Earth—
is it not like the *tǔqiào*?
Empty yet unyielding, moved yet ever responsive.
**Annotation:** *Tǔ* (leather pouch) refers to a skin bellows,
used to fan wind and ignite fire.
*Qiào* (reed pipe) is the *dí* (reed pipe),
meaning Heaven and Earth regard all things as straw-dogs
because of their boundless void,
thus generating all without favor or expectation—
just as the discarded bellows fans wind,
and the reed pipe breathes air.
Ever responsive to demand,
yet without regard for me,
they empty themselves without yielding,
and motion brings forth ever more breath and sound.

This likens the ruler’s empty-hearted silence,
pure transformation and uniform harmony,
so there is no yielding or constraint,
and daily use remains unknowing—
motion brings forth ever more teaching and efficacy.

**Master Héshànggōng said:** Between Heaven and Earth, the void is boundless,
and harmonious *qi* flows freely,
thus all things arise spontaneously.
If a person can eliminate emotions and desires,
restrain indulgence in flavors,
purify the five *zàng* (viscera),
then divine clarity will dwell within them.

Like the *tǔqiào*, within it is empty and void,
thus it can produce sound and breath.

**Master Róng said:** Between Heaven and Earth—
it is like the *tǔqiào*.
Empty yet unyielding,
moved yet ever responsive.
**Annotation:** *Tǔ* (leather pouch) refers to the bellows;
*qiào* (reed pipe) refers to the *suō* (mouth organ’s pipe).
**Explanation:** *Qiāo* (yielding) means exhaustion;
*jiān* (void) means the interior.
The bellows, being hollow within,
can endlessly produce all things.
If a person can empty the heart and body,
deploy wisdom and virtue without limit,
then their efficacy is boundless.

**Master Cheng’s exegesis:** *Tǔ* is the leather pouch;
*qiào* is the reed pipe.
Heaven, Earth, and the Sage empty the heart for benefit—
like the *shēngguǎn* (mouth organ),
when the leather pouch is inflated,
the meaning of emptiness continues in the following passage.
Empty yet unyielding,
moved yet ever responsive.

**Master Yu’s exegesis:** The *tǔqiào* empties the heart without yielding,
and motion brings forth ever more breath and sound.

**Master Héshànggōng said:** If the *tǔqiào* were to abandon emptiness for attachment,
then its inner and outer would be blocked,
and breath would not follow.

**Master Yán said:** Heaven and Earth, though empty,
act with love—
then transformation falters,
and things do not arise fully.
The Sage, though empty,
acts with love—
then virtue does not spread universally,
the realm does not ascend,
grace does not reach deeply,
and deeds are not fully accomplished.
The *tǔqiào*, though empty,
acts with love—
then its interior and exterior are sealed,
and breath does not flow.
Why so?
Because love brings obstruction.

**Master Cheng’s exegesis:** *Qiāo* (yielding) means exhaustion.
The *tǔqiào* is hollow within,
thus breath and sound emerge.
If it were not exhausted,
it would be like Heaven and Earth’s lack of intention,
thus their creative transformation is boundless.
Motion brings forth ever more—
the *tǔqiào* moves, and breath and sound arise;
the Sage responds, and teachings emerge.

**Thirdly, it rejects excessive knowledge and broad learning,
preferring instead to grasp the True.
Excessive speech, though many,
does not surpass holding to the Center.
**Master Yu’s annotation:** Excessive speech without practice
brings only constraint and exhaustion.
Universal love is hard to fulfill,
leading to resentment and hatred,
thus it is better to embrace the *chōnghé* (unifying harmony),
and all will be naturally sufficient.

**Master Yu’s exegesis:** Excessive speech—
that is, much talk of universal love.
Much talk of universal love,
yet in action, it is hard to fulfill,
thus constraint and exhaustion arise without completion.
This shows that it is better to forget and respond in emptiness,
embracing the *chōnghé* (unifying harmony),
then all will naturally suffice.
**Annotation:** ‘Without practice’ means *xùn* (to answer/fulfill),
referring to mere empty words
that do not align with action.

**Master Héshànggōng said:** Excessive speech brings exhaustion,
excessive deeds harm the spirit,
excessive speech harms the body.
With tongue and lips moving,
disaster and calamity are sure to follow.
Better to hold to the Center,
better to hold to virtue within,
nurturing the spirit and guarding the breath,
loving few words.

**Master Yán said:** Heaven and Earth do not speak,
yet through their emptiness,
they attain the Center of all things,
and the generation of beings is boundless.
The Sage does not speak,
yet laws and decrees are empty and in accord with all—
then the celestial prisons are void without prohibition,
the spirits and gods are tranquil without action,
and the realm is vast and orderly,
unaware and unknowing,
yet in great harmony.

**Master Róng said:** *Qióng* (exhaustion) means *kùn* (constraint).
If speech is just and true,
it fills the world without error.
If speech is not just and true,
then calamity enters through the mouth—
this is constraint and exhaustion.
Yet calamity and fortune lie in correctness and error,
not in quantity or lack.
Now, excessive speech brings exhaustion,
warning against the loss of excessive speech,
urging instead the gain of holding to the Center,
so there is no obstruction in teaching,
and inner accord with the forgotten word.

**Master Cheng’s exegesis:** Excessive knowledge—
that is, broad and all-embracing learning.
Exhaustion—
that is, excessive speech.
Broad learning and excessive speech
only increase worldly wisdom,
yet they do not grasp the Dao,
and their essence returns to the *qióngzhōng yīdào* (one path of emptiness and constraint).
Excessive knowledge is but a means for action,
while holding to the Center leads to longevity and eternal vision—
thus they are measured against each other,
and holding to the Center is superior.
Hence, *Zhuangzi* says:
*"When the superficial is destroyed, the essential remains;
when the broad is drowned, the heart is preserved."*

Yang Zhu further remarked:
*"A neighbor loses his sheep through many branching paths,
while a scholar loses the Dao through many methods."*

**Chapter Six: The Unending Valley Spirit**
This chapter follows the previous one because the prior passage emphasized that extensive learning and broad knowledge are inferior to holding to the Center, and thus this chapter clarifies that only by holding to the Center can one attain the Unending Valley Spirit.

Within this chapter, the meaning is divided into two parts:
First, it reveals the profound and mysterious Dao, capable of generating and sustaining the Two Principles.
Second, it illustrates the ceaseless and unchanging, yet effortless operation.

**First Part: Revealing the Profound and Mysterious Dao, Capable of Generating and Sustaining the Two Principles**
Indeed, both Heaven and humanity receive life through the wondrous *qi*. If one cultivates and nourishes it, they attain perfect wholeness. Thus, the Yellow Emperor rode dragons and ascended to the clouds, while Master Shu Qing attached himself to a deer and visited the Han Dynasty—both achieving millennial longevity. They laughed at the countless burial mounds, returning in the eighth month to inspect their homes, seeing the prancing steeds of immortals. The primal *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing) *qì* endures, the Valley Spirit preserves life, subtly and enduringly.

By adhering to the singular principle, one achieves eternal solidity;
By consuming the five *yá* (tooth-like, refined essences), one attains the True.

White hair returns to youthful vitality,
Tortoise-like years extend to great longevity.
Seeing the morning fungus and not sighing,
Embracing the great *chūn* (thousand-year) tree with certainty.

To the left, I pat the shoulder of Hongya,
To the right, I draw upon the spirit of Gaoqiu.
How does one reach this?
The subtle principles of nurturing and guarding are profound indeed.

**The Unending Valley Spirit**
**Master Guo’s Annotation:**
*Gǔ* (Valley) is empty yet responsive.
*Shén* (Spirit) is wondrous and unfathomable.
*Sǐ* (Death) signifies rest.
The Valley’s response to sound is unknown—
Yet when there is sensation, it responds,
And its response is as divine,
As divine as its response, yet it never rests.
To illuminate the supreme Dao—
Empty yet generating all things,
Its wondrous operation defies naming,
Thus the Valley Spirit is used as an analogy.

**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**
The Unending Valley Spirit refers to the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).
The Valley Spirit clarifies how the Valley responds to sound,
Like the Dao responding to things—
When there is sensation, it responds,
And its response is divine.
*Shén* (Spirit) is the name for the unfathomable.
*Death* signifies rest,
Yet the unfathomable response never rests,
Hence, the Valley Spirit does not die.

*Xiān* (Profound) means deep.
*Mǎn* (Taem) means mother.
The Valley Spirit’s response is profoundly mysterious and beyond naming,
Nurturing all things to flourish,
Thus it is called the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).

The gate of the *xiānmǎn* is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
The operation of the *xiānmǎn* is such that
When there is sensation, it responds,
And its response arises from things,
Thus it is called a gate.

A gate signifies entry and exit.
Heaven and Earth, the greatest of formed things,
Without the operation of the *xiānmǎn*,
Would fragment and disperse.
Thus, they rely on the singular principle as their root,
Hence, it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

*Gēn* (Root) means origin.

**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**
*Gǔ* (Valley) means nourishment.
If one can nourish the spirit, they will not die.
The spirit refers to the spirits of the five *zàng* (viscera).
The liver houses the *hún* (ethereal soul),
The lungs house the *pò* (corporeal soul),
The heart houses the spirit,
The kidneys house the *jīng* (essence),
The spleen houses the *zhì* (willpower).
When the five *zàng* are all injured,
The five spirits depart.

**Master Yán said:**
The supreme harmony of wondrous *qi*,
Like a wondrous thing as divine,
Emptiness as its dwelling,
Silence as its constant state,
Entering and exiting without openings,
Coming and going without hindrance,
In motion, nothing fails,
In stillness, nothing is incomplete,
Transforming yet not transforming,
Generating yet not generating.

**Master Róng said:**
The Unending Valley Spirit is the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).
Master Hé Shànggōng spoke of it as nourishing the spirit,
Which is the method of *sǐcún* (thoughtful preservation).
Master Fǔsì spoke of the emptiness within the Valley,
This is metaphorical language.
Though the insights of the true and virtuous are lofty,
They are all explanations of particulars.

Now, I shall speak of this in terms of principle.
*Gǔ* (Valley) is emptiness,
*Xiān* (Profound) is the Dao,
*Mǎn* (Taem) is stillness.

If one has form and spirit,
Then there is life and death.
If there is life and death,
One cannot speak of the Dao,
For it flows and shifts without constancy—
How could it be called still?

If one can empty form and spirit,
Abandoning the self and objects,
Exiting without root,
Gathering *qi* yet not claiming life,
Entering without openings,
Dispersing *qi* yet not claiming death—
Not dying, not living,
This is the meaning of the Valley Spirit.

Life and death are ever-present,
Floating and unstable, lacking substance.
Deep, feminine, and still,
Serene and unmoving—
This is the meaning of *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*Gǔ* (Valley) is emptiness.
*Shén* (Spirit) is luminous intelligence.
Master Hé Shànggōng said:
*Gǔ* (Valley) means nourishment,
Speaking of how the common people wander through life and death
Due to their attachment to desires.
If one can guide and gather the spirit,
Like bathing in emptiness,
With a pure and unobstructed container,
Then one will no longer experience life and death.

This is called the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).

**Master Guo’s Annotation:**
*Xiān* (Profound) is the name for the unobstructed.
*Mǎn* (Taem) signifies feminine gentleness.
To clarify nourishing the spirit like the Valley,
So that it does not die,
There is nothing better than stillness, retreat, and feminine gentleness—
A pure and unobstructed container of singularity.

**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**
The Dao of not dying lies in the *xiānmǎn* (dark, nurturing).
*Xiān* (Profound) is Heaven,
In humans, it is the nose.
*Mǎn* (Taem) is Earth,
In humans, it is the [mouth].
Heaven nourishes humans with the five *qì*,
Entering through the nose and stored in the heart.
The five *qì*, pure and subtle,
Become the spirit, clarity, intelligence, sound, and harmony.
Their ghost is called *hún* (ethereal soul),
The *hún* is masculine,
Controlling entry and exit through the nose,
Communicating with Heaven,
Thus the nose is called *xiān* (profound).

*Mǎn* (Taem) is Earth,
Earth nourishes humans with the five flavors,
Entering through the mouth and processed by the stomach.
The five flavors, coarse and impure,
Become the form, flesh, bones, and the six emotions.
Their ghost is called *pò* (corporeal soul),
The *pò* is feminine,
Generated through entry and exit by the mouth,
Communicating with Earth,
Thus it is called *mǎn* (taem).

**Master Yán said:**
The *mǎn* (taem), though feminine and yielding, can generate the profound,
Like the distant and unseen yet nurturing as a mother,
Its form unseen.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
This continues the previous passage.
*Xiān* (Profound) is the name for the unobstructed.
*Mǎn* (Taem) signifies feminine gentleness.
To clarify nourishing the spirit like the Valley,
So that it does not die,
There is nothing better than stillness, retreat, and feminine gentleness—
A pure and unobstructed container of singularity.

The **Gate of the Profound Taem**—
This is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.

**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
Deep and mysterious, the empty Taem,
Capable of mothering all things—
All things arise from it,
Thus it is called the **Gate**.

Heaven and Earth have form,
Hence they rely on it as their fundamental root.

**Master Yu’s Exegesis:**
The function of the Profound Taem—
When stimulated, it responds;
Its response issues forth to all things,
Thus it is called the **Gate**.

The **Gate** signifies entry and exit.
Heaven and Earth, the greatest of formed things,
Without the function of the Profound Taem,
Would fragment and disperse.
Thus, they rely on perceiving the One as their fundamental root—
Hence it is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.
**Root** means **origin**.

**Master He Shang Gong said:**
The **Root** is the **Primordial**.
Speaking of the Gate of the Taem,
This is where the **Primordial Qi of Heaven and Earth** circulates.

**Master Yán said:**
The **Great Harmony** generates the One,
Unborn yet undying,
Endless yet unceasing—
Opening and guiding the spirit,
This is the **Root and Primordial** of Heaven and Earth.

**Master Róng said:**
The Dao in stillness is formless and without attributes;
When it moves, the **Earth’s and Heaven’s** phenomena emerge from it,
Thus it is named the **Gate**.
Heaven and Earth depend on it to generate,
Hence it is called the **Root**.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
This speaks of the profound, unobstructed Dao,
The feminine, empty, gentle, and still method,
Capable of opening and transforming all things,
Generating and transforming the Two Polarities—
Thus it is called the **Root**.

**Secondly, it clarifies the unobstructed and unceasing,**
**Endless as if existing,**
**Used without exertion.**

**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
The function of the empty Taem is subtle and profound,
Its application as if present,
Its use without intent—
Thus it does not labor.

**Master Yu’s Exegesis:**
**Endless** means subtly unceasing.
The function of the empty Taem is without self-interest.
Subtle and profound, it is called *as if existing*.
Without self-interest, its use is without exertion or fatigue.

**Master He Shang Gong said:**
Endless as if existing—
The nostrils and mouth inhale and exhale,
Should be subtle and profound,
As if existing, yet as if nonexistent.
**Used without exertion**—
The use of qi should be expansive and relaxed,
Not hurried or labored.

**Master Yán said:**
Dynamic and static, profound and mysterious,
As if nonexistent, as if existing,
Accomplishing things and completing affairs,
Without fail—
Shining yet undying,
Used without exertion,
Because its generation is non-generation,
Its form is formless.

**Master Róng said:**
**Endless** means **subtle and profound**.
The Dao of the Profound Taem
Is neither born nor destroyed,
The principle of feminine stillness
Is neither existence nor nonexistence—
Desiring to speak, yet no form is seen;
Desiring to vanish, yet all things arise.
Neither flourishing nor declining,
Neither constant nor interrupted—
Thus it is called **endless**.

**Exertion** means **toil**.
Obtaining the Dao of the Profound Taem,
Its application is boundless,
Effortless and leisurely—
Thus it does not labor.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
**Endless**—a subtle, unbroken appearance.
**As if**—a semblance.
**Existing**—having.

If one speaks of the spirit as empty, this is the view of annihilation;
If one speaks of the spirit as having substance, this is the view of permanence.
Earlier, the emptiness of the spirit was spoken of,
And thus immortality was attained—
Yet still, fearing that students might stagnate in this emptiness,
Now it is said: *If* it exists,
To cure the view of annihilation.

Again, fearing that students might drown in the having,
The word *as if* is appended to cure the view of permanence—
Thus, employing this practice of neither non-existence nor existence,
This mind of neither permanence nor interruption,
As the essential technique for cultivating the Dao,
It is not laborious yet truly authentic.

Thus, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:
*"To move is to bear the burden of kalpas,
Reflecting on how wearying and toilsome it is—
My learning is in having no learning,
Only then can one illuminate the natural."*

**Chapter on Heaven’s Duration and Earth’s Longevity**
This chapter follows the previous one,
For the prior chapter elucidates the Dao of the Profound Taem,
Capable of establishing the two principles—
Thus, this chapter follows, relying on the two principles,
As the method for cultivation.

Within this chapter, there are three layers:
First, the two principles are directly presented through hypothetical question and answer;
Second, the capacity of the Sage’s wisdom and cultivation is briefly revealed;
Third, a concluding praise of the Sage’s singular eminence is given.

**First: The Two Principles Presented Through Hypothetical Question and Answer**
The Three Powers initiate the primordial breath,
The Two Principles firmly established—
The sun and moon hang their luminous forms,
Stars illuminate the darkness—
The Azure Dragon ascends to govern Heaven,
The White Steed carries the Earth in motion,
Thunder and lightning display their might,
Qi spreads through yin and yang—
Born from the Dao itself,
The mother of all things,
Vile yet precious,
The Eight Gates where the clay pot flies,
Wisdom that is not foolish,
The Master of Shu’s clarity over ten thousand acres.

Unrevealed yet undiminished,
The Great Dao thus lends its form—
Enduring peace, enduring stability,
Wondrous transformations are forged within—
Beneath, it steadies mountains and valleys;
Above, it floats as mist and cloud—
A pile of eggs unbroken,
For its essence is the power of the Great Dao.

**Heaven’s Duration and Earth’s Longevity.**

**Imperial Commentary:**
Marking Heaven and Earth’s longevity,
To show that without selfishness or contrivance,
One can endure and persist—
The meaning is fulfilled in the Sage,
Who transcends the body yet preserves it,
Achieving private through the abandonment of private.

**Imperial Exegesis:**
This marks the chapter’s title—
Heaven is marked by its qi and phenomena, hence *long*;
Earth is marked by its form and substance, hence *durable*.

**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**
Speaking of Heaven and Earth’s longevity and vitality,
It is an analogy for instructing people.

**Master Róng said:**
Heaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist
Lies in their not self-generating—
Thus they can attain longevity.

The sun and moon wax and wane,
Their cycles of decline and return cannot be halted—
Yin and yang contract and expand,
The seasons of cold and heat pass swiftly—
Yet all things are insufficient within them,
Thus the Two Principles alone endure—
Hence, the virtues of Heaven and Earth are marked,
And the reason for their longevity is asked—
None but the principle of *wu-xin* (non-selfishness),
Not self-cultivating in their generation.

If people can model themselves after Heaven and Earth,
With *wu-xin* and not self-cultivating to nourish deeply,
Then the bones of the immortal will surpass gold and stone,
And eternal blessings will endure—
Binding the square and round eternally and firmly.
But if one cannot abandon right and wrong to align with the Dao,
Or abandon emotions and desires to congeal the True One—
Then deaf and blind to sounds and colors,
Nostrils and mouths overwhelmed by fragrance and flavor,
The body wearies externally,
The mind exhausts internally—
Then a hundred years are like morning dew,
A thousand gold like evening cockscomb—
Thus it is said: *People’s disregard for death*
Arises from their not deeply valuing life—
Thus they lightly regard death.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Though the Two Principles are vast,
They still have the limit of kalpa’s exhaustion—
Yet within their forms, they slightly extend longevity,
Thus Heaven and Earth are cited to analogize the Sage.

Heaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist
Lies in their not self-generating—
Thus they can attain longevity.

**Imperial Commentary:**
Heaven and Earth generate all things,
Their virtues and applications are vast,
Yet they endure and persist
Because they draw from the Dao’s endowment,
Not arrogating their own creative function—
Thus it is so.

**Imperial Exegesis:**
Earlier, the chapter’s title was marked—
Now, a hypothetical question is posed.

The question states:
*"Why can Heaven and Earth endure and persist?"*
Because they cover and nourish all things,
And all draw sustenance from the wondrous origin—
They do not arrogate their own creative functions,
Thus they can endure and generate all things.

Another explanation:
*"Not self-generating"* means
Heaven and Earth merely generate and nourish all things,
Not enriching their own lives—
Thus they can endure and persist.

**Master Hé Shànggōng said:**
Heaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist
Lies in their not self-generating.
Heaven and Earth alone endure and persist
Because they are tranquil and selfless in their actions,
Not like humans, who anxiously seek their own benefits,
Plundering others to enrich themselves—
Thus they can endure and persist,
For they do not seek life—
Thus they can attain eternal longevity without end.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Heaven and Earth’s ability to endure and persist
Is posed as a hypothetical question to elucidate its meaning—
*"Not self-generating"* is the answer to the prior question,
Explaining its origin.

It states:
Heaven and Earth merely bestow life upon all things,
Not cultivating their own existence—
Thus they can endure and persist.

**Node Analysis:**
*Heaven’s Duration* refers to the *níwán* (cranial center),
*Earth’s Longevity* refers to the *dāntián* (lower elixir field)—
From the *níwán* descending to the *xiàngguān* (palace of light),
The *dāntián* ascending in a single flow—
Above and below, the primordial *qi* circulates and permeates,
All joints are moistened,
Harmonious *qi* spontaneously arises,
The Great Dao is complete—
Thus it is called *long life*.

**Second: Briefly Revealing the Sage’s Wisdom and Cultivation**
Thus, the Sage places his body last yet it is first,
Sets his body aside yet it is preserved.

「**Master’s Annotation:**
To place one’s body last means others gladly advance it,
Thus one’s body is first.
To set one’s body aside means the heart forgets self-interest,
Thus one’s body is preserved.

**Master’s Commentary:**
Therefore, the Sage follows the Heaven and Earth’s nurturing,
Ensuring equitable nourishment without favoritism,
Thus advancing his body first for all to rely upon,
The people joyfully depend on him,
As the foundation for those below,
So his body is first.
He does not exalt himself,
Nor does he neglect his own body,
When the world returns to *rén* (benevolence),
He fears no harm,
Thus his body is preserved.

**Master Héshàng Gōng says:**
Therefore, the Sage places his body last yet his body is first,
Advances others before himself.
Yet his body is first, for the world respects him,
Advancing him to positions of authority.
To set his body aside is to treat himself lightly while enriching others.
Yet his body is preserved, for the people love him as their parents,
And the *shénmíng* (divine luminaries) protect him like a cherished child,
Thus his body remains eternally preserved.

**Master Yán says:**
The Sage’s awe commands the eight directions,
His keen insight permeates the four quarters—
Yet his wisdom lies beyond desire,
His plans beyond action.
He humbles himself to honor Heaven,
Sets himself aside to bring peace to the people,
Thus without action he achieves,
Without words he is trusted,
All wish to serve him as their lord,
So he advances others.
He reverses his own inclinations to follow the Dao,
Sets aside his own interests to bring peace to the people—
His merit is boundless, yet unseen,
His virtue towering, yet unheard.
His transformation flows with the divine luminaries,
His lifespan aligns with the mountains and rivers,
Thus his body is preserved.

**Harmony with the Dao.**
**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
Therefore, the Sage—
Few forget their emotions and still their *jī* (mechanisms),
Many pursue song and deviate from truth—
Only the Sage can enact this.
Practicing humility to dwell behind all things,
His exalted virtue thus dwells first.
Preserving the Dao, he sets his body aside yet his body remains,
His own essence ascends to merge with the analogy.
The Sage is he who aligns with Heaven and Earth’s virtue,
Setting forth his lofty conduct as a model for all.
To place his body last is to first grant others passage.
Yet his body is first, transcending the *sānjiè* (Three Realms).
To set his body aside is to fortify his limbs.
Yet his body is preserved, attaining *long life*.
**Third section concludes with praise for the Sage’s unique and noble virtue.**
Is it not because he has no private interests?
Thus he fulfills his own private essence.»

The **Commentary** states:
Heaven and Earth forget their nurturing function—this is *wu si* (no private interest).
Yet they endure long and vast—this is fulfilling their own private essence.
The Sage sets aside and transcends his body—this is *wu si*,
Yet he is first and preserved—this is fulfilling his own private essence.

**Commentary on the Commentary** says:
Heaven and Earth endure long, the Sage is first and preserved—
Is it not because they have no selfish intent,
Yet achieve this enduring, first-preserved private essence?

**Master He Shang Gong** says:
Is it not because of their *wu si*?
The Sage is loved by people, favored by the numinous—
Is it not because of his impartiality and *wu si*?
Thus he fulfills his own private essence.

What others call *si* (private),
Is to enrich oneself in desire.
The Sage, without *si*, yet himself is enriched—
Thus he fulfills his own private essence.

**Master Rong** says:
Ordinary beings are mired in desires, their spirit obscured,
Lacking absolute impartiality, harboring partiality.
They exalt themselves while burdening others,
Hoard for their own bodies while neglecting people,
Desire to lead yet cannot transcend others,
Seek preservation yet their bodies perish.

The Sage, without intent, desires to dwell first—
Naturally he is first.
Without desires, seeks firm preservation—
Naturally he is preserved.
Thus it is said: he fulfills his own private essence.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:
This is his *wu shī* (no selfhood),
Thus he fulfills his *shī* (selfhood).
*Shī* is the master—
The Sage, observing all things, sees emptiness in self and name,
Both void—
Thus he can set himself aside and lead others,
Forget self to aid others—
Thus he has no master.
Yet it is said he fulfills his *shī*—
In praise of the Sage’s virtue harmonizing with Heaven and Earth,
Like a straw dog for the people,
Thus alone he dwells in the Three Realms’ exalted position,
Fulfilling the transformation of Heaven and humanity.

---
**Chapter Eight: The Chapter on Supreme Virtue**
This chapter follows the previous one,
For the prior chapter briefly illuminated the conduct of forgetting self,
Yet did not reveal its efficacy—
Thus this chapter expounds further,
Extolling the person of forgetting self,
Who possesses extraordinary abilities and wondrous functions.

Within this chapter, three distinct meanings unfold:
First, it establishes *shàngshàn* (supreme virtue) with two analogies—law and metaphor.
Second, it broadly enumerates three abilities, elaborating seven virtues.
Third, it concludes with praise for gentleness and weakness,
Thus free from blemish.

**First: Establishing Supreme Virtue with Two Analogies**
Supreme virtue is profound and mysterious,
The true essence, its secrets hidden.
It mirrors all phenomena in emptiness,
Gives birth to the Three Powers in spontaneity.
The gateway to all wonders,
Where all life converges,
The threshold of tranquil forgetting,
Where inert beings proliferate.
How shall we liken it?
Like water filling a vessel to its brim,
Becoming the boundless sea’s surging tide,
Like the *Wèilú* Mountains containing the Yellow River’s flood,
Draining the earth—
Though vast and unfathomable,
Yet serene and supremely yielding,
Cleansing filth from the world,
Preserving clarity within its nature.
Thus the Way’s function may be approached:
**Supreme virtue is like water.**

**Commentary** says:
To illuminate the Sage’s supreme virtue,
Water’s nature is taken as an analogy to the Dao.

**Commentary on the Commentary** says:
*Shàngshàn* (supreme virtue) marks the person.
*Ruò shuǐ* (like water) is the metaphor.
The Sage’s emptiness embraces all—
Without clinging to the law, yet virtue arises—
This is virtue’s summit.

The Sage’s conduct, like water’s function,
In the following text, all align with law and metaphor.

**Master He Shang Gong** says:
The person of supreme virtue is like water’s nature.

**Master Rong** says:
Supreme virtue is like water—
Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
Dwells where people revile,
Thus it nears the Dao.
Its principles are profound and distant,
Hard to fathom—
The virtuous cultivating the Way,
Their actions are subtle and wondrous,
Thus water is borrowed as metaphor.

Water nourishes things, the Dao aids people—
Thus it is said to benefit.
Water yields to obstacles, the Dao is vast and equal—
Thus it is said not to contend.
People often revile what is low, yet water flows downward,
The Dao practices humility—
Thus it is said to dwell where others revile.
*Jì* (near)—water’s nature nears the Dao,
Thus it is taken as analogy.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:
Water has two kinds—
One clings, one forgets—
This is forgetting virtue, thus called supreme.
Water has many uses,
Thus it is paired as analogy.
Its functions and virtues are listed below.

**Master Jié’s Explanation** says:
*Shàn* (virtue) refers to the *jīn* (saliva).
Rinsing with it yields sweet dew,
Swallowing it benefits all spirits.
If you wish to practice this,
Morning and evening, rinse the *Huá Chí* (Jade Pool),
Filling your mouth with saliva,
Then tilt your head to swallow,
Benefiting all spirits and enriching your essence.

---
**Second: Broadly Enumerating Three Abilities, Elaborating Seven Virtues**
Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
Dwells where people revile—
Thus it nears the Dao.

**Commentary** says:
*Jì* (near) means close.

**Commentary on the Commentary** says:
Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
Dwells where people revile—
Water’s nature is sweet and cool,
Scattering everywhere, its dew nourishes all.
Those it benefits grow—
Thus it is said to benefit—this is its first ability.
Under Heaven, none are softer than water,
Yet it can be modeled—
Its clarity reflects others,
Flowing, it submits to obstacles,
Following its course—
It never contends—this is its second ability.
It reviles low places, yet people flock there—
Water accepts filth, dwells in evil without complaint—this is its third ability.
Thus it nears the Dao—*jì* (near) means close.
Benefiting others shows its vast efficacy,
Not contending reveals its gentleness,
Dwelling in evil demonstrates its tolerance of defilement—
These are water’s three abilities,
Which the Sage embodies as one.
His conduct is not far from the Dao—
Thus it is said he is near.

**Master He Shang Gong** says:
Water benefits all things—
In Heaven, it is mist and dew;
On Earth, it is springs and rivers.
Yet it does not contend,
Dwelling where people revile—
People revile what is low, damp, and filthy,
Yet water alone flows quietly there.
Thus it nears the Dao—
Water’s nature nearly aligns with the Dao.

「○ Cheng Shu [Master Cheng’s commentary] says:
Water excels in benefiting all things—
It is mist and dew in Heaven,
Springs and rivers on Earth,
Moistening and nourishing all,
Its efficacy widespread.
Thus it is likened to the Sage’s virtue.

The Sage’s virtue responds to all things,
His benevolent deeds are flexible and expedient,
His skillful means open and transform—
Their meaning aligns with water’s nature,
Hence the comparison.

Again, water does not contend—
Its nature is gentle and yielding,
It does not vie with others,
Adapting to square or round vessels,
Filling or receding as people will.
The Sage’s highest conduct,
In responding to all things, is likewise.

It dwells in what people revile—
What they revile are lowly places,
And water alone resides there.
People all seek the high and despise the low,
Their arrogance tramples others,
Yet the Sage alone forsakes the high to embrace the low,
Gentle, yielding, and still.

Thus it nears the Dao—*jì* (near) means close—
His conduct embodies these three abilities,
Hence it is near the Dao.
With the three abilities now explained,
Next, the seven virtues are revealed.

**Residing in the Virtuous Land**—
*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:
The Sage’s highest virtue,
In his gentle and yielding conduct,
Is like water dwelling in low places,
Nourishing all things.
The land is humble in its use,
Water favors flowing downward—
Thus it is said the Sage resides in the virtuous land.
*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:
The Sage’s dwelling,
Exemplifies vast beneficence.
Like water on Earth,
It brings abundant benefit to all.
Again, the land’s virtue lies in its humility,
Water flows downward naturally,
Matching the Sage’s meekness and compliance,
Nearly aligning with the Dao’s gentle nature—
Thus it is said he resides in the virtuous land.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
Water’s nature harmonizes with the land—
Above grass and trees, it flows downward,
Like transformation, its movement subjugates all.

**Rong says:**
Water does not discriminate in its flow,
It moves wherever it is placed—
The Sage’s path is always virtuous.

**Master Cheng’s commentary:**
Water’s nature favors the low,
Finding peace in downward flow.
The Sage’s highest virtue lies in humility,
For humility is auspicious—
Thus he dwells in low places,
Called the land of *non-contention*.

**The Heart is Virtuous in Depth**—
*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:
A virtuous heart is deep and still,
Like water’s settled clarity.

*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:
The Sage’s heart,
Exemplifies profound tranquility—
Like water’s nature,
Resting as a pure spring.
Water’s stillness reveals its clarity,
A quiet heart attains insight.

Thus it is said the heart is virtuous in depth.
*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:
Water’s heart is empty and profound,
Its depths clear and bright.

*Rong says:*
Water’s heart is still yet clear,
A human heart is empty yet reflective.

**Master Cheng’s commentary:**
Depth means still water—
Water’s settled purity is clean and bright,
Its depths unfathomable.
The Sage’s heart is like a boundless spring,
Still yet illuminating—
Thus still water reflects all things,
An empty heart perceives all objects.

**Generosity is Virtuous in Benevolence**—
*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:
Generosity in giving aligns with the utmost benevolence,
Like water’s nourishment of all things.

*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:
The Sage’s vast compassion,
Always extends to others.
Generosity’s essence harmonizes with benevolent conduct,
Like water’s nourishment—
It bestows without favor or aversion,
Thus it is said generosity is virtuous in benevolence.

*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:
All things rely on water to thrive,
It gives to the empty, not the full.

*Rong says:*
Water harmonizes with all things,
Humans benefit the common folk.

**Master Cheng’s commentary:**
Benevolence means grace—
Water’s nature clings and moistens,
Its grace nourishes all things.
The Sage’s virtue is compassionate and saving,
His grace extends to all beings—
Compassion knows no bounds of enmity or kinship,
Moistening does not discriminate between cold or foul.

**Speech is Virtuous in Faithfulness**—
*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:
Words spoken are true and real,
Like water’s flow through perilous paths,
Never failing in its truth.

*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:
The Sage’s highest speech,
Words must be true and real,
Guiding the common folk toward transformation,
His faithfulness never deceives.

Like flowing springs,
Do they differ from treacherous ravines?
Thus it is said speech is virtuous in faithfulness.
The annotation states: *Water flows through perilous paths yet never loses its truth*—
This is the language of the *Zhou Yi* [Book of Changes] on *Kǎn* [the hexagram of danger].

*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:
Water’s inner reflection mirrors all forms,
Its clarity never falters.

*Rong says:*
Water’s reflection of things,
Beauty or ugliness, never distorts their form.
The benevolent in speech,
Their words never diverge from their truth.

**Master Cheng’s commentary:**
Faithfulness means reality—
Water can purify and reveal all appearances,
Beauty or ugliness, without deception.
The Sage’s words validate truth,
Their faithfulness is like a seal’s verification—
Even the tides of the sea,
Three times daily, never fail their appointed hour.
Much more so the Sage’s wisdom,
Which discerns all things,
Never neglecting the three categories of beings.

**Governance is Virtuous in Rectification**—
*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:
Governance excels in proper ordering,
Like water’s cleansing of all things,
Making them pure and cold.

*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:
Governance means uprightness—
The Sage in his affairs,
Acts without contrivance,
His uprightness guides all things,
And all things follow naturally.
Uprightness brings self-ordering,
What else could be called virtuous?
Like water’s nature,
It cleanses all things,
Making them pure and serene—
Thus it is said governance is virtuous in rectification.

*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:
There is nothing water does not cleanse,
Its purity is vast and even.

*Rong says:*
Great peace is none greater than still water,
No partiality exceeds the Sage’s virtue.

**Master Cheng’s commentary:**
Water’s nature is level and without bias,
The Sage’s heart is upright and rectifies all evil.
As *Zhuangzi* says:
*In the midst of balance, the standard is set—
The great artisan takes his measure from it.*

**Capability is Virtuous in Skillfulness**—
*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:
In all affairs, his capability is skillful,
Like water’s nature—
Square or round, it adapts to the vessel,
Neither hindered nor obstructed by things.

*御疏* [Master He’s commentary]:
The Sage’s clarity and insight,
In all things, are without hindrance.
Whatever there is to move or act,
In all affairs, he is proficient.
Proficiency is skillfulness,
This is his illuminated understanding.
Like water’s nature,
It becomes a river when flowing,
A pond when obstructed—
Supporting boats, embracing emptiness,
It accomplishes all things—
This is its skillfulness.

*御注* [Master He Shang Gong’s annotation]:
It can be square or round,
Curved or straight, as form demands.

*Rong says:*
Water’s lack of use makes it unformed,
Yet the Sage’s purpose is never incomplete.

**Master Cheng’s commentary:**
Water’s nature is multifaceted in its capabilities,
Adapting to all affairs for benefit.
The Sage’s wisdom is insightful yet yielding,
His success comes from aligning with things.

**The Way’s Seven Virtues**—
Thus water’s three abilities,
And the Sage’s seven virtues,
Are nearly one in essence.
His conduct is not far from the Dao—
Thus it is said he is near.»

**The Way’s Virtues in Motion**

**Timely Action**
*Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:*
Things respond and react—
when it does not fail its season,
it is like water:
spring it flows, winter it congeals.

*Master He’s Exegesis:*
The Perfect One’s heart
is like the hollow valley,
like a mirror’s reflection—
when things stimulate it, it responds.
Like water’s nature:
spring it rises, winter it congeals,
ebbing and flowing with the seasons.
Thus it is said: *Timely Action.*

*Master He Shang Gong:*
Summer it scatters, winter it congeals—
responding to stimuli, never missing the cosmic time.

*Rong says:*
Water congeals in winter, flows in summer,
never erring in its rhythms.
The Sage acts in accord with the seasons—
never failing what is proper.

*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:*
Water congeals in winter, releases in summer,
flowing and solidifying with the times.
How much more so the Sage’s insightful, empty wisdom—
responding as things arise,
observing the moment, acting or stilling,
never failing in what is fitting.
Emerging or retiring, speaking or silent—
dual yet one.

*The Seven Virtues’ Conclusion:*
This is how the Sage practices the Dao to govern himself,
discarding deceit and falsehood,
establishing norms for later sages.
These seven virtues
all arise from a single action—
within form, the myriad spirits act of their own accord.

**Third Virtue: Gentle Weakness**
Thus without blemish.

**The Virtue of Non-Contention**
*Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:*
The highest virtue is empty-hearted,
yielding to things—
like water’s nature:
obstructed, it stops; unobstructed, it flows.
It neither resists nor opposes things,
so there is no fault or blame.

*Master He’s Exegesis:*
*Fault* means *transgression*.
The Perfect One’s conduct is flawless,
harmonizing with things without injury,
empty-hearted yet complete,
never competing or contending.
Its currents ebb and flow,
submissive and yielding—
never resisting things,
so there is no fault or blame.

*Master He Shang Gong:*
Only by not contending
does it stop when obstructed, flow when unobstructed—
yielding to others.
Thus there is no fault.
Water’s nature is such—
the world has no grievance against water.

*Yan says:*
Human nature is gentle, weak in defense,
descending from high to low,
bearing insult like the earth,
containing filth like the sea.
Its words conform to others’ hearts,
its body follows behind.
What others detest,
it alone endures—
serene as if without thought,
drifted upon as if without end.
Its transformations are ever-changing,
flowing and stilling with the Dao,
abandoning self, following things—
nothing surpasses water.
If the Sage-King embodies this,
using it to govern,
his virtue is subtle and profound—
what fault could there be?

*Rong says:*
Water has no will of its own.
If one empties oneself,
not aligning with things,
as previously explained—
only water and the Sage, by not contending,
are capable of contending.
This is the natural Way.

*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:*
Only by righteousness, emptiness, gentleness, and yielding
is there no fault or transgression.

*End of Volume Two of the *Dao De Jing’s* Profound Virtue and Its Revered Commentary*
*Beginning of Volume Three of the *Dao De Jing’s* Profound Virtue and Its Compiled Commentary*

「Emperor Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary and Exegesis
—Master He Shanggong’s *Strict* Commentary, Lord Yan Junping’s *Righteous* Commentary, Master Li Rong’s *Illuminating* Commentary,
—Master Xi Hua’s *Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning*, Master Mengyang Qiangsi’s *Compiled Commentary*

**Chapter Nine: *Hold Yet Overflow***

This chapter follows the previous one, for the prior expounded on the supreme excellence of *wuwei* (non-action) and the Way’s highest virtue—emptying oneself to benefit others. Thus, this chapter reveals the perils of worldly desires and self-inflicted blame, the reasons for which it follows. Here, one chapter unfolds three distinct teachings:

1. **The dangers of clinging to desires with a fixed heart—prone to ruin.**
2. **Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting calamity.**
3. **Only humility, gentleness, and quiet retreat align with the Dao.**

**1. The dangers of clinging to desires with a fixed heart—prone to ruin.**
The heavens and earth are vast crucibles of divine transformation, yet even their luminous forms—moon and sun—abide by the measure of waxing and waning, lest they falter. Mountains and rivers stand deep and firm, yet they endure the fate of collapse and exhaustion. How much more so we, mere mortals, who dare to grasp at fullness? We stamp our feet in the realm of sound and color, indulging our hearts in the duality of self and other. Our minds teem with wicked seeds, yet we remain blind to their absence of clarity; our hearts bristle with malevolent intent, yet we persist in delusion, secure and undisturbed. Like infants wailing in their cradles, we rise from the Three Palaces to lodge our complaints; like bones exposed to the elements, we drift through the Nine Abysses, unrecognized. The folly of a mortal’s life is thus inverted—truly blind, yet unseeing, and how deeply pitiable!

**To hold yet overflow is not as good as simply ceasing.**
*Imperial Commentary:* Grasping at fullness and overflow, preventing their loss, only burdens one with wealth—regret and stinginess arise thereafter. Thus, it is better to cease.
Cease means *to stop*.

*Imperial Exegesis:* **Hold** is *to grasp*; **overflow** is *fullness*; **cease** is *to stop*.
The human heart, greedy and loving desires, endlessly seeks and takes, grasping and preserving to ensure fullness. Yet wealth becomes a burden, and regret and stinginess fester anew. Therefore, the Sage warns: *Better to rest than to persist*.

*He Shanggong says:* Overflow is fullness; cease is to stop. To grasp at fullness guarantees its loss—better to stop.

*Yan Junping says:* When one pollutes the paths of all beings with political schemes and the accumulation of wealth, the heavier the riches, the more one’s spirit and clarity are depleted. Wealth and gain, piling up, only breed the guilt of life and death—far better to cease before fullness is reached.

*Li Rong says:* A tilted vessel, filled to the brim, must topple; excess and indulgence, once overflowing, must fail. If one wishes to avoid ruin and defeat, only humility and restraint suffice.

*Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning:* **Hold** is *to grasp*; **overflow** is *fullness*; **cease** is *to stop*.
Those who cannot retreat in quietude nor embrace humility, who persist in grasping and seeking fullness, who boast of their greatness and scheme to overpower others—such folly will surely invite ruin. Better to stop than to act.

Thus, the *Zhuangzi* states: *"Fill to the brim, and it will topple and perish."* And the *Book of Documents* says: *"Fullness invites loss; humility invites benefit."*

**To probe yet sharpen is not long-enduring.**
*Imperial Commentary:* To measure and sharpen one’s ambitions, pursuing honor and fame, will inevitably breed arrogance—sitting thus invites misfortune and blame. Hence, it cannot endure long.

*Imperial Exegesis:* **Probe** is *to measure*; **sharpen** is *to whet*.
When mundane emotions are sluggish and drowned, one clings to the pursuit of honor and gain. Thus, one measures past events, whets the heart’s desires, and invites the resentment of ghosts and men—sitting in such folly will surely bring misfortune and blame. Hence, it cannot endure long.

*He Shanggong says:* **Probe** is *to govern*; one first governs by probing, yet later must abandon it.

*Yan Junping says:* To whet one’s heart and sharpen one’s resolve, to strategize with cunning—when one’s wisdom grows sharp and one’s rank and reputation swell, one’s vitality wanes while the body advances. How can such a state endure long?

*Li Rong says:* Honor invites censure; prosperity invites weariness. A sharp mind that stands out among others will be scorned by men—how can it endure long?

*Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning:* **Probe** is *to polish*; **sharpen** is *to refine*.
To polish a blade or whet a tool—though refined, they must surely wear. How much more so when one polishes and sharpens one’s own heart, demanding only of others, whose harm is greater than that of weapons? All things are my inferior, yet I persist—how can such folly endure long?

*Commentary by Mengyang Qiangsi:* The upper **probe** refers to reckless speech; the lower **probe** refers to scattered spirit. Reckless speech invites war and strife; scattered spirit invites decay and loss—teeth falling, hair turning white.

**2. Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting calamity.**
Gold and jade fill the halls—yet none can guard them.

*Imperial Commentary:* This reveals that overflow cannot be long preserved.

*Imperial Exegesis:* Even if one ceaselessly demands and takes, filling halls with gold and jade—like the sun with teeth yet burning its own body, or the rooster with fear yet having its tail cut—one will lose the very treasures one sought to hoard, inviting the woes of bandits. How can such folly be guarded? This reverses the meaning of *holding yet overflowing*.

*Commentary by Mengyang Qiangsi:* Without blood, there is no gold; without essence, there is no jade. If one can cultivate the *One*, the upper and lower will flow freely—rumbling within the belly like thunder, limbs and joints supported, eyes bright and responsive, in harmony with the *One*.

*He Shanggong says:* Lustful desires weary the spirit; wealth burdens the body.

*Yan Junping says:* Wealth and honor, like ice and coal—both cannot coexist. Honor and power are defilements of the spirit; gain and wealth are harms to the body. To nourish the spirit’s defilements and accumulate the body’s harms is to diminish the means of one’s flourishing while fostering the causes of one’s ruin. The more one gains in wealth, the more one’s *qi* is exhausted—how can it be guarded?

*Li Rong says:* Gold and jade have no feet, yet they scatter of their own accord. Fire and water’s disasters cannot be repelled; bandits and thieves cannot be warded off. Thus, it is known: to hoard and gather is to lose the Way; to disperse and give is to conform with the Dao.

*Exegesis by Cheng Xuaning:* Desires excessive, the spirit grows weary; wealth accumulated, the body labors. When both body and mind are thus strained, none can guard them. Moreover, if one hoards without dispersing, great thieves will surely come. Within, one harbors grief and sorrow; without, one’s grasp weakens. When the body perishes, the wealth remains—thus, none can guard it.»

---

Wealth and honor yet proud—one invites one’s own calamity.
*Imperial Commentary:* This reveals the sharpness that cannot be measured.
Pride arises from the heart, hence the retribution comes not from others.

*Imperial Exegesis:* *Heru* (遗), to bestow. Wealth invites others’ pursuit, hence one easily deceives things.
Honor invites subservience, hence one takes to domineering others.
When arrogance and excess reach their height, misfortune comes—who can blame?
Because of pride, retribution arises; pride stems from the heart—thus it is said, "one invites it oneself."
This is the reversal of measuring sharpness.

*River Above Master* says: When wealthy, one should relieve the poor; when honored, one should pity the lowly. Yet to indulge in pride and licentiousness is to invite disaster.

*Yan* says: To be wealthy and honored yet not proud is easy to speak but hard to practice. The higher one’s station, the loftier one’s aspirations—yet to be proud in wealth and honor is like a torch meeting fire: the brighter the door, the faster the flame consumes. How can one not be cautious?

*Li Rong* says: Accumulated wealth, if not dispersed, and riding honor to oppress others—retribution arises from within, not from without.

*Cheng Exegesis:* *Jiu* (咎), an omen. *Heru* (遗), to bestow. Those in wealth and honor ought to aid others, yet failing to be modest, they grow ever more arrogant and swollen, bringing ruin upon themselves—how could it concern others?

*Concise Explanation:* It speaks of those in wealth and honor who covet fame, riches, and bribes, unwilling to cultivate the Dao, until death comes. Even if one hoards money to the heavens, what use is it to the body? When the body dies, the name perishes. Only through humility, gentleness, and retreat does one align with the Dao of Heaven.

When achievements are complete and reputation fulfilled, retreat is the Way of Heaven.
*Imperial Commentary:* Those whose achievements are complete and reputation fulfilled should withdraw to decline prominence—this is not yet the Dao of Heaven. Only by observing the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness can one be free from worry and rest.

*Imperial Exegesis:* This is a warning. Fullness invites loss; humility invites benefit. Even Heaven does not remain perpetually full, so those whose achievements are complete meet ruin, and those whose reputation is fulfilled suffer decline. To seek enduring preservation—no such words have been heard. One must forget merit and step back, withdrawing from prominence like the Dao of Heaven, never losing the balance of fullness and emptiness, thus free from blame and worry.

*River Above Master* says: When a person’s deeds are accomplished and reputation established, if they do not withdraw and avoid their position, they will surely meet disaster—this is the constant Dao of Heaven. Like the sun at its zenith moving on, the moon at fullness waning, things at their peak declining, and extreme joy turning to sorrow.

*Li Rong* says: Yin and yang succeed one another; cold and heat shift in turn—this is the constant principle of things, the eternal Dao of Heaven. If one clings to honor without retreat, disaster follows. The exegeses thus perceive the signs; the Four Worthies departed in understanding, aligning with the principles of things and the Dao of Heaven.

*Cheng Exegesis:* Heaven is the natural order. The sun at its zenith declines; the moon at fullness wanes—waning and fullness alternate, extremes reverse—this is their constant nature. Thus, those whose worldly achievements are complete and whose reputation is fulfilled must guard their station, know contentment, practice humility, gentleness, and retreat, dwelling in uncompetitive places, avoiding harm, and preserving life. Only thus do they deeply align with the true Dao of Heaven. Those whose achievements are complete and reputation fulfilled must withdraw and refine their conduct, acting naturally.

**Chapter Eleven: Nurturing the Vital Essence (载营魄)**

This chapter follows the previous, which broadly expounded the faults of arrogance and the virtue of humility and retreat. Yet regarding the practice of the Dao’s path, its methods were still incomplete. Thus, this chapter elaborates on the inner and outer practices, detailing their functions step by step. Its meaning is divided into three parts: first, it clarifies restraining the spirit and subduing the vital essence, focusing on inner cultivation; second, it broadly displays the conduct of governing the state and benefiting others; third, it reveals the beauty of attaining the Dao and forgetting merit.

**First: Restraining the Spirit and Subduing the Vital Essence, Guarding Oneness in Inner Cultivation**

Just as rare trees flourish with fragrance and forest flowers bloom with charm, it is because their roots are deep and their stems firm, drawing nourishment from the dew. So too for humanity: the spirit and vital essence must be nourished, preserving harmonious *qi* to self-moisten, guarding humility and gentleness to achieve completion.

When snow falls thickly, one must endure the toil of coming and going;
When the rooster crows, one must add to the diligence of night and day.
One must ensure the vital essence and spirit are harmonious and at peace,
Lest the mind and spirit scatter and stray.
Know that Ziji controlled the white crane to part the clouds,
Only then did he realize the Master’s lute, riding the red carp, soared to the Han.
If one abandons true essence for mundane affairs,
The Dao’s sorrow is profound—how dark the common folk’s ignorance!

Nurturing the vital essence and embracing oneness—how could it ever depart?

*Imperial Commentary:* At the beginning of life, the vital essence is called *po* (魄); once born, the *po* becomes *hun* (魂) with the rise of yang. The *po* is yin and empty, the *hun* is yang and full. It speaks of the initial bearing of empty *po*, which must constantly be nurtured and protected to restore yang. When yang *qi* fills the *po*, it becomes *hun*; if the *hun* can move, life is complete. *One* means "unrestrained." To restore yang and preserve life, one must not be contaminated—thus, one must embrace and guard pure oneness, lest it depart from the body.

*Imperial Exegesis:* *Zai* (载), initial. *Ying* (营), to protect. It says that at the start of life, one is but an empty form; once the *po* is born, yang *qi* fills the empty *po*. If the *po* can move, it is called *hun*—like the moon’s reflection illuminating the sun, generating light. Thus, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Zichan said: "At the beginning of life, the vital essence is called *po*; once the *po* is born, yang becomes *hun."* It speaks of the initial bearing of empty *po*, which must be nurtured and protected, constantly ensuring yang *qi* fills it, thus preserving life. If movement is irregular and yang *qi* is dissipated, it reverts to empty *po* and perishes. *Zhuangzi* says: "The mind near death must not restore yang." Thus, one must nurture and protect the empty *po*, restoring yang to preserve life, embracing and guarding pure oneness, lest it be contaminated—then life is complete. This teaches the nourishment of the spirit.

*River Above Master* says: *Zai ying po* (载营魄), *ying* is *hun* (魂).

「The human being bears *hun* and *po* above, and thereby sustains life—this must be cherished and nourished.
Joy and anger harm the *hun*; sudden fright harms the *po*.
The *hun* resides in the liver, the *po* in the lungs.
Rich wine and sweetness corrupt the liver and lungs,
so when the *hun* is tranquil, one’s resolve in the Dao remains undisturbed,
and when the *po* is secure, longevity and extended years are attained.
Can one not depart from *oneness*?
It is said that if one can embrace *oneness*,
keeping it ever-present within oneself, then one may endure forever.
*Oneness* is the Dao’s initial manifestation,
the essence of *Great Harmony* (太和),
hence it is called *oneness*.

It is proclaimed throughout the world:
the heavens attain *oneness* and thereby become clear,
the earth attains *oneness* and thereby becomes settled,
and sovereigns attain *oneness* to establish righteousness.
Within, it becomes the heart;
without, it becomes conduct.
When it is dispersed, it is called *application* (施);
in totality, it is called *oneness*.
The term *oneness* means
a singular resolve with no duplicity.

**Honor** says:
*Load* (载) means *circulate*.
*Camp* (营) means *protect*.
*Po* (魄) is the vital spirit of the body.
*Oneness* is the Dao.
The human being is the Dao’s vehicle,
hence it is said to *load*.
A pure body ensures *hun* and *po* are secure;
a turbid heart drives away the true spirit.
With contemplation and vigilance, one guards the spirit,
hence it is said to *camp*.
The mind must not be divided,
hence it is said to be *one*.
When wisdom aligns with the Dao,
the spirit harmonizes with the form,
hence it is said that there is no *departure*.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:
*Load hun and po* (载营魄):
*Load* (载) means *circulate*.
*Camp hun* (营魂) is the yang spirit, urging one toward goodness.
*Po* (魄) is the yin spirit, urging one toward vice.
Thus, the *hun* is restless yet inclined toward life,
while the *po* is tranquil, desiring detachment from birth and death.
Moreover, the *hun*’s nature is bold and vigorous,
prone to receiving joy and anger,
while the *po*’s nature is yielding and passive,
prone to receiving fright and terror.
Fright, terror, joy, and anger
all diminish the vital spirit.
Hence, at the outset of cultivating the Dao,
one must first restrain the *hun* and subdue the *po*,
preventing their unrestrained movement.
If one can embrace *oneness* without departing,
*embrace* (抱) means *guard*,
*oneness* refers to the *three-in-one* (三一),
*departure* (离) means *scatter*.
Having restrained the *hun* and subdued the *po*,
one must next guard the *three-in-one* spirit,
keeping it empty, tranquil, and concentrated,
so that it does not scatter.
Can one focus the *qi* to attain softness,
as with an infant?
**Master Cheng’s Annotation** says:
To focus the *succinct qi* (冲气),
making it harmonious and soft like an infant,
without discrimination—
this is the teaching of nourishing *qi*.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:
*Focus* (专) means *concentrated focus*.
*Qi* (气) is the Dao.
*Attain* (致) means *obtain*.
*Softness* (柔) is *harmony*.
It is merely to concentrate on the Dao’s *qi*,
obtaining the principle of harmonious softness,
hence like an infant’s lack of desire.
Can one purify and clarify *mystic vision* (玄览),
and thereby be free of flaws?
**Master Cheng’s Annotation** says:
*Purify* (涤) means *wash*.
*Clarify* (除) means *order*.
*Mystic vision* (玄览) is the heart’s illumination.
*Flaws* (疵) are *illnesses*.
To wash and order the heart’s illumination,
making it pure and clear,
so that desires do not arise,
and one may be free of illness—
this is the teaching of refining the heart.

**River Above Master** says:
*Purify and clarify mystic vision* (涤除玄览),
one must wash the heart,
making it pristine and pure.
The heart dwells in the *mystic void* (玄冥),
perceiving all things,
hence it is called *mystic vision*.
Can one be free of flaws?
It means not indulging in licentiousness.
**Honor** says:
To bathe in the *mystic flow* (玄流) and wash the heart—*purify* (涤).
To sway the *numinous breeze* (灵风) and dispel burdens—*clarify* (除).
Within and without, perfectly pure,
like the clarity of a mirror in water,
and in integrity, without blemish,
cutting off the defects of jade and pearl.
**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:
*Purify* (涤) means *wash*.
*Clarify* (除) means *dispel*.
*Mystic vision* (玄览) is *perception*.
*Flaws* (疵) are *illnesses*.
To purify and dispel the *six palaces* (六府),
and clarify the *five emotions* (五情),
the spirit and *qi* become empty and mystic,
hence one may perceive subtle principles,
and within and without, be serene,
free of illness.

**The Second Section Illuminates the Broad and Manifest Practices of Governing and Benefiting the People.**
To cherish the people and govern the realm,
can one act without *action* (為)?
**Master Cheng’s Annotation** says:
To cherish and nourish the myriad people,
to oversee state affairs,
can one act without *action*?
It should be natural and self-transforming.
From above, one circulates and protects *po*—
all are released to cultivate the self.
When the self is cultivated, *virtue* is complete,
hence one may be their sovereign.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:
*Cherishing the people* (爱民)
means ensuring they do not suffer sudden violence,
and laboring without harming their nature.
*Governing the realm* (治国)
means prioritizing agriculture and valuing grain,
simplifying affairs and avoiding excess,
so that the people find ease in life,
and order is achieved without words.
This is *non-action* (无为).
Can one attain it?

**River Above Master** says:
*Cherishing the people and governing the realm* (爱民治国):
One who governs the self cherishes *qi* and thereby preserves the body;
one who governs the realm cherishes the people and thereby secures the state.
Can one act without *knowledge*?
In governing the self, one breathes in the refined *qi*,
without letting it be heard by the ears.
In governing the realm, one dispenses *virtue* and bestows benevolence,
without letting the subjects know of it.

**Honor** says:
The sovereign cannot self-transform,
and must rely on others to transform.
The principles of things and human affairs depend on tranquility—
only those who act with *action* (有為) are restless and harm things;
those who act without *action* (無為) are tranquil and cherish the people.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary** says:
Having already perfected the Dao for self-benefit,
one must now apply it to others.
The most urgent practice is to govern the realm and cherish the people.
*Knowledge* (知) is discriminative wisdom.
Compassionate and merciful nurturing is called *cherishing the people*,
and implementing policies to transform is called *governing the realm».*

「Thus, in governing the realm, one must display one’s sincerity and simplicity,
and teach *non-action* (無為).
One must extinguish their deceitful and perverse ways,
and block all discriminative distinctions.
In doing so, the *striking the earth* custom shall return,
and the *tying knots* governance may be emulated.

Therefore, the following passage states:
To govern the realm with *knowledge* (知) is to be the realm’s thief,
but not to govern the realm with *knowledge* is to be the realm’s *virtue* (德).

Can one act as the *feminine* (雌)?
**Imperial Commentary** says:
*Heaven’s Gate* (天門) is where the *cosmic cycles* (歷數) emerge.
*Opening and closing* (開闢) refers to the rise and fall of order.
It means that when the sovereign receives the *Mandate of Heaven* (受命),
can they maintain *feminine tranquility* (雌靜),
then they may endure and enjoy the *Heavenly Blessings* (天祿) forever.

Another interpretation says:
*The Classic of Changes* (《易》) states:
*"The constant does not rely on the masculine to complete itself,
but guards the feminine principle—
just as Heaven’s Gate opens and closes,
retreating to yield more humility."*

**Imperial Commentary** further explains:
To rule as a sovereign, one must cultivate *virtue* (德).
A sovereign must uphold the *cosmic cycles* (歷數),
for *Heaven’s Gate* (天門) is where the *imperial succession* (帝王歷數) originates.
*Opening* (開) signifies receiving the *Mandate of Heaven* (受命),
while *closing* (闢) signifies abdication (廢黜).
When Heaven bestows its *precious Mandate* (寶命),
it grants prosperity to those with the *Way* (道).
If one can maintain *feminine tranquility* (雌柔),
they may attain the ultimate *auspiciousness* (元吉).
Thus it says: Can one act as the *feminine* (雌)?

Another interpretation says:
*The Classic of Changes* (《易》) states:
*"The alternation of opening and closing is called *change* (變).*
It means the Sage establishes teachings
to adapt to ever-shifting circumstances,
never relying on the masculine alone,
but guarding the *feminine principle*—
just as Heaven’s Gate opens and closes,
receding to further humility and balance."

**River Above Master** (河上公) says:
*Heaven’s Gate* (天門) refers to the *Purple Office* (紫官) of the *Northern Pole* (北極).
*Opening and closing* (開闢) signifies the *five cosmic junctures* (五際) of beginning and end.
In *governing the body* (治身),
*Heaven’s Gate* (天門) refers to the nostrils—
*opening* (開) is breathing in,
*closing* (闢) is breathing out.
To *act as the feminine* (為雌) means
to govern the body with *tranquility and softness* (安靜柔弱),
and to govern the realm by harmonizing responses without excess.

**Honor** says:
Heaven has *four seasonal gates* (四時之門):
the *Blue Gate* (青門) opens and brings warmth,
the *Red Gate* (赤門) opens and brings heat,
the *White Gate* (白門) opens and brings cold,
the *Black Gate* (黑門) opens and brings chill.
Nowadays, the common people suffer oppressive summer rains and bitter cold,
all because they cannot maintain *tranquility*.
*Closing* (闢) means shutting—
when one gate opens, the other three close.
*Feminine* (雌) is *tranquility*.
The Sage’s spirit is concentrated in the *Great Void* (太漠),
their wisdom is still in the *Empty Mysterious* (虚玄),
and neither life nor death, nor calamity or fortune,
can disturb them.
Nor can fire, water, cold, or heat move them.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏) says:
*Closing* (闢) means shutting,
*feminine* (雌) is *tranquility*.
When Heaven and Earth *close and open* (閉闢),
it refers to the *formation and destruction of kalpas* (劫運).
It means the Sage dwells harmoniously within the *Two Principles* (二儀),
unaffected by the *Three Calamities* (三災).
Though the kalpas may rise or fall,
the Sage’s heart remains ever *Empty and Tranquil* (虚靜),
thus *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The Great Flood submerged Heaven yet did not drown me,
the Great Drought made metal and stone flow,
earth-mountains withered and cracked,
yet I did not feel the heat."*

*Fourfold illumination* (明白四達) means
the Sage’s *virtue* (德) is clear and boundless,
like the radiance of the sun and moon.
*Four* (四) signifies the four directions,
*illumination* (照) means unobstructed,
*illumination* (達) means without hindrance.
It means the Sage’s *Empty and Clear Virtue* (空惠明白)
penetrates the *Mystic Principles* (玄理),
their wisdom illuminates all things,
and their perception reaches every domain—
thus mentioning *four* suffices to encompass the *Eight Extremes* (八極).
Yet they remain ever still,
and respond without contradiction,
so their *fourfold illumination* persists.
Their responses never disrupt their stillness—
they remain in *non-action* (無為) always.

Another interpretation says:
*Fourfold illumination* (四達) means
penetrating the *Three Realms* (三界) and the *Dao* (道).
To *generate and nurture* (生之畜之)
is to *generate without possession* (生而不有),
*act without reliance* (為而不恃),
and *endure without domination* (長而不宰)—
this is called *Mystic Virtue* (玄德).

**Imperial Commentary** says:
The sovereign *generates and nurtures* (生之畜之),
letting all things fulfill their natural growth and sustenance.
They fulfill life without claiming it as their own,
act without relying on their deeds,
and endure without ruling over others.
If a sovereign can do this,
it is called *Mystic Virtue* (深玄之德).

**Imperial Commentary** further explains:
*Generate and nurture* (生之畜之)
is elaborated in the lower scripture:
*"The Dao generates all things,
and *virtue* (德) nurtures them."*
Here, it means the sovereign upholds the *Pure Way* (清净之道),
allowing all things to fulfill their natural essence (*生理*).
They embody *virtue* (德) to broadly aid and sustain,
letting all things attain their full sustenance (*畜養*).
Thus it says: *generate and nurture* (生之畜之).
To *generate without possession* (生而不有),
*act without reliance* (為而不恃),
and *endure without domination* (長而不宰)
is called *Mystic Virtue* (玄德).
Things fulfill their natural growth,
while the Sage forgets their own deeds.
When things fulfill their growth,
their natural essence is complete,
and when deeds are forgotten,
their efficacy remains constant—
this is *selfless yet all-encompassing*,
*non-domination yet rule*.
Thus, *to generate without possession* (生而不有)
means the sovereign lets all things fulfill their natural growth,
yet does not claim it as their own.
*To act without reliance* (為而不恃)
means they allow all to act as they will,
yet do not credit the deeds as their own achievements.
As the sovereign over all people,
it is said they *endure* (長),
yet do not rely on their deeds—
thus *not to dominate* (不宰).
Such is called *Mystic Virtue* (深玄之德).

**River Above Master** (河上公) says:
*Generate and nurture* (生之畜之)
refers to the Dao generating all things and nurturing them.
To *generate without possession* (生而不有)
means the Dao generates all things yet takes nothing for itself.
To *act without reliance* (為而不恃)
means the Dao’s actions are not done in expectation of reward.
To *endure without domination* (長而不宰)
means the Dao endures and nurtures all things,
growing vast yet never seizing or controlling—
it merely provides them as instruments for use.»

「This is called *Mystic Virtue* (玄德), for the Dao/Way’s virtue is profound and unfathomable (玄冥), beyond direct perception, yet it seeks to guide people toward its nature.

○ **Yan** (严) says:
*Not possessing, not relying, not taking credit, not dominating* (不有不恃不以不宰),
the transformations are unfathomable (变化冥冥).
The heavens and earth regulate themselves naturally (天地自理).
*Going without* (去为) is an analogy to illustrate the principle of teaching (譬以况理教).
The teaching’s words are said to be *possession* (有),
yet the principle transcends all names and speech—*emptiness* (无).
The teaching’s practice is to clarify through the principle (因理而明),
and the principle is elucidated through teaching (理之诠焉).
By teaching, the principle becomes manifest (由教而显),
and the principle relies on teaching to reveal itself (理因教显).
Without teaching, the principle has no means of expression (无教理无所寄),
and without the principle, teaching has no foundation (教籍理明).
Without the principle, what is teaching’s purpose (无理教何所说)?

Having understood the interdependence of principle and teaching (理教之相由),
one grasps how *possession* and *emptiness* serve as its essence (是体有无之为用).

○ **Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏) cites *The Rites of Zhou – The Record of Craftsmen* (《周礼·考工记》):
*"Thirty spokes resemble the thirty days,
to complete one month."* (三十辐象三十日，以成一月也)

When it is *emptiness* (当其无),
the hub’s interior is hollow (箱毂内空),
yet this very hollowness allows it to contain things—
thus the wheel’s utility (只为空能容物，故有车用).
Consider the scholar’s mind as emptiness (況学人心空),
so it can bear the weight of all sentient beings (故能运载苍生也).
Moreover, the wheel is but a *conventional name* (假名),
arising from the harmonious convergence of all conditions (诸缘和合而成).
Analyzing its nature thoroughly,
one finds its entirety is void and illusory (此车细析推寻，遍体虚幻).
How much more so for all dharmas (诸法),
which are likewise in their entirety.

*Molding clay to make vessels* (埏埴以为器),
when it is *emptiness* (当其无),
the vessel’s utility is realized (有器之用).
**Yu’s Annotation** (御注):
*埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和).
*坛* (Tamped earth) refers to *clay* (土).
The potter harmonizes the clay,
forging it into jars and pots (陶匠和土，为瓦缶之器也).

**Yu’s Commentary** (御疏):
*埏埴* (Molding clay) refers to *adhesive clay* (粘土).
The annotation says *potter* (陶匠),
yet *The Book of Documents* (《尚书》) states:
*"To knead the earth is called pottery."* (范土曰陶)
Here, the potter kneads and molds the clay,
fires it into ceramic vessels,
and takes advantage of their emptiness
to hold and receive things (烧以成器，器中空虚，以用盛受物也).

○ **River Above Master** (河上公) says:
*Molding clay to make vessels* (埏埴以为器),
*埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和),
*坛* (Tamped earth) refers to *clay* (土).
The potter harmonizes the clay
to create vessels for food and drink (和土以为食饮之器也).
When it is *emptiness* (当其无),
the vessel’s utility is realized—
its hollowness allows it to contain and receive (器中空虚，故得有所盛受也).

○ **Rong** (荣) says:
To *make vessels*, one must first harmonize the clay (作器必须和泥),
and only when the clay is refined does the vessel serve its purpose (泥调则器可用).
To *cultivate the self*, one must purify conduct (修身理宜炼行),
and only when conduct is pure does the Dao/Way manifest (行洁则道可成).
*埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和),
*埴* (Clay) refers to *earth* (土).

○ **Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏) again cites *The Record of Craftsmen* (《考工记》):
*"埏* (Cultivating) means *harmonizing* (和).
*値* (Clay) refers to *adhesive clay* (粘土).
Harmonizing adhesive clay with water and earth,
firing it to form vessels—
though the vessel’s interior is empty,
it is capable of containing and receiving (和粘水土，烧以成器，器中空无，故得盛受).
This illustrates how the scholar’s mind, being emptiness,
can embrace all things (況学人心空，故能容物).

*Carving doors and windows to make a dwelling* (凿户牖以为室),
when it is *emptiness* (当其无),
the dwelling’s utility is realized (有室之用).
**Yu’s Annotation** (御注):
In ancient times, people dug caves to dwell in (古者陶穴以为室宇),
and even these were furnished with doors and windows (亦开户牖),
hence the term *carving* (故云凿耳).

**Yu’s Commentary** (御疏):
*凿* (Carving) means *piercing* or *hollowing* (穿).
*牖* (Windows) refers to openings beside doors (门旁窗).
In ancient times, people lived in caves (穴居),
so *The Book of Odes* (《诗》) says:
*"To dig and cover the cave"* (陶复陶穴),
meaning they hollowed out the earth within the cave
and covered it above—
hence the term *carving* (穿凿穴中之土以复覆其上，故云凿耳).
Later sages replaced this with official dwellings (官室),
yet the principle remains:
the dwelling’s emptiness allows people to reside (取其室中空虚，所以人得居处).
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"If a dwelling has no emptiness,
even wives and mothers-in-law will jostle for passage"* (室无空虚，则妇姑勃蹊),
meaning they will *contend for the path* (勃蹊谓争路也).
*The Er Ya* (《尔雅》) states:
*"Official halls are called dwellings"* (官谓之室).
Thus, *possession* (有) is for *advantage* (利),
while *emptiness* (无) is for *utility* (用).
The advantage of *possession* (有体利无)
is that it relies on *emptiness* (以无为利),
yet the advantage of *emptiness* (利铃资无)
is that it depends on *possession*—
hence *emptiness* is advantageous through *possession* (故有以无为利也).
The utility of *emptiness* (无之所用)
is rooted in its form (用於体),
yet its form requires *possession*—
hence *emptiness* derives utility from *possession* (体必资有，故无以有为用也).
The annotation says:
*"That which transcends form is called Dao/Way* (形而上者曰道),
*that which is beneath form is called vessel* (形而下者曰器),
as written in *The Systematic Words of the Yi* (《易·系辞》).
When it is purely *emptiness*, it is called Dao/Way (自无则称道),
and when it involves *possession*, it is called vessel (涉有则称器).
To clarify the Dao/Way’s utility,
one must use form and vessel as analogies (欲明道用，必约形器以彰).
Though these analogies employ the three illustrations,
the ultimate aim remains to emphasize *emptiness* in all governance (终用无於一政耳).

○ **River Above Master** (河上公) says:
*Carving doors and windows to make a dwelling* (凿户牖以为室)
refers to constructing houses (谓作室屋).
When it is *emptiness* (当其无),
the dwelling’s utility is realized—
doors and windows are hollow,
allowing people to enter and exit (户牖室虚，人得以出入).
Observing the dwelling’s emptiness,
people can reside within—
this is its utility (观视室中空虚，人得居处，是其用也).

○ **Rong** (荣) says:
If a dwelling is not hollow within,
and lacks doors and windows without,
its utility is not difficult to grasp (其为用不以难乎).
Yet the Dao/Way is inwardly obscure and dark (内既暗昧),
externally deaf and blind (外复聋瞽),
and seeking it thus is no easy matter (以此求道，理非易乎).
A dwelling with doors and windows is useful (室开户牖，有用也).
So too, when a person’s wisdom is enlightened,
the Dao/Way is accomplished (人生慧解，道成之).

○ **Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏):
To pierce and hollow doors and windows,
to construct houses—
though the interior is empty,
it allows people to reside (穿凿户牖，以为屋室，室中空无，故得居处).
Consider the scholar’s mind as emptiness,
so it can embrace all things (況学人心空，故能覆物).
Moreover, piercing and hollowing doors and windows
allows passage for people,
yet emptiness in the roots and orifices
permits use without attachment (況根窍虚通，故能用而无染).
The three analogies—wheel, vessel, and dwelling—
share similar meaning,
yet they are repeated for emphasis:
the wheel is for motion but not stillness (车则动而不静),
the dwelling is for stillness but not motion (室则静而不动),
the vessel is both motion and stillness (器则亦动亦静).
These three distinctions
are why they are restated (有此三异，故重出之).
The second purpose is to distinguish *possession* and *emptiness*,
and to clarify their interdependence (显明资导).
Thus, *possession* is for *advantage*,
and *emptiness* is for *utility* (故有之以为利，无之以为用).

**Yu’s Annotation** (御注):
*Possession* relies on *emptiness* for advantage (有体利无),
and *emptiness* is advantageous through *possession* (以无为利).
*Emptiness* derives utility from *possession* (无用体者),
and *possession* is the means of *emptiness’* utility (以有为用).
Moreover, that which transcends form is called Dao/Way (形而上者曰道),
and that which is beneath form is called vessel (形而下者曰器).
To elucidate the supreme Dao/Way’s utility,
one must use form and substance as analogies (将明至道之用，约形质以彰).
Thus, one borrows the coarse advantage of *possession* over *emptiness*
to clarify the subtle utility of *emptiness* in *possession* (故借粗有之利无，以明妙无之用有耳).

○ **River Above Master** (河上公) says:
Thus, *possession* is for *advantage* (故有之以为利),
for things benefit from their form (物利於形),
and vessels contain things while dwellings shelter people—
yet one fears the house may collapse (器中有物，室中有人，恐其屋破坏).
The stomach contains the spirit (腹中有神),
yet one fears the body’s decay (畏其形之消亡也).
*Emptiness* is for *utility* (无之以为用),
for only within the void can one contain and receive (虚空中者，乃可用盛受物),
hence it is said: *"The void governs the form of possession"* (故曰虚无制有形).
The Dao/Way is emptiness itself (道者空无也).

○ **Rong** (荣) says:
If there is only *possession* and no *emptiness*,
*possession* alone cannot be advantageous (有不得为利).
If there is only *emptiness* and no *possession*,
*emptiness* alone cannot serve its purpose (无不得为用).
This makes clear that *possession* depends on *emptiness* for advantage (明有因无以为利),
and *emptiness* depends on *possession* for utility (无因有以为用).
Having recognized how *possession* and *emptiness* interdependently arise (既识有无之相因),
one naturally understands the coarse and subtle as mutually reliant (自知粗妙之相籍也).」

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Possession* relies on *emptiness* for advantage,
*emptiness* depends on *possession* for utility—
these two principles mutually support each other,
thus forming the Dao/Way of vehicles and such.

It is said that the student must use *possession* to nourish *emptiness*,
and *emptiness* to guide *possession*—
when *possession* and *emptiness* mutually nourish and guide,
the mind does not become one-sided or immersed,
thus achieving the student’s utility.

**Chapter XII: The Five Colors Blind the Eyes**

The discussion of the five colors follows the preceding chapter,
for the earlier chapter broadly cited vehicles and instruments
to demonstrate that dependent principles are not inherent.
Thus, this chapter directly examines colors and sounds
to clarify the true *dharma* and the opposition of emptiness and illusion,
hence its placement here.

Within this chapter, three teachings unfold:
1. **The dust defiles the faculties—one must cultivate aversion.**
2. **The faculties are stained by dusty realms—one must be urged to stillness.**
3. **The distinction between sages and commoners—demonstrating their choices.**

**1. The dust defiles the faculties—one must cultivate aversion.**

The supreme Dao/Way is tranquil and forgetful,
its nature and essence both quiescent.
From a single breath of *qi*, humanity is formed.
The rounded head upholds Heaven,
the square feet tread Earth.
The four limbs mirror the four seasons,
the five viscera follow the five phases—
thus the eyes and ears attain clarity,
the mind and emotions become luminous.

One must veil the artificial hues of *possession*,
returning to the pristine source of truth.
How could the restless, roving heart
bind itself to the deeds of blindness and deafness,
unable to sever deceit and illusion,
pursuing the Great Dao/Way?
It rides the vermilion phoenix to the Red Terrace,
commands the dark rainbow in the Azure Abyss—
abandoning that to take this,
eternally becoming a True Person.

The five colors blind the eyes,
the five sounds deafen the ears,
the five flavors dull the palate.

**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**
The eyes delight in the sights of blue, yellow, red, white, and black;
the ears indulge in the melodies of *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*—
thus the form and body become blind and deaf.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Colors refer to blue, yellow, red, white, and black;
sounds refer to *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*;
flavors refer to sour, bitter, spicy, sweet, and salty.
*"Dull"* means "erroneous."
The eyes see colors, the ears hear sounds, the mouth tastes flavors—
if indulged to excess, harm inevitably follows.
Thus, one’s form and body become blind, deaf, and dulled.

Moreover, if one is infatuated with the transient laws of the world,
unaware that colors and sounds are empty in nature,
how could it be only the form and body that are blind and deaf?
This is also the blindness and deafness of wisdom.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
The five colors blind the eyes—
greed and lust for colors drain the essence, causing blindness.
The five sounds deafen the ears—
indulgence in the five tones disperses the harmonious *qi* of the heart,
rendering one unable to hear the soundless sound.
The five flavors dull the palate—
deceitful craving for the five flavors makes the mouth dull,
speaking of deviation from the Dao/Way.

**Master Yan says:**
Those who indulge in the five colors’ sights
see neither the forms of blessings nor calamities—
colors are the spear that pierces the eyes.
Those who abandon themselves to the variations of the five sounds
cannot hear the voices of auspiciousness or misfortune—
they are the mallet that seals the ears.
Those who delight in the five flavors’ changes
cannot discern the true emotions of right and wrong—
they are the instrument that severs the tongue.

**Master Rong says:**
Though the eyes can see, if one is infatuated with colors without restraint,
they lose their clarity.
Though the ears can hear, if one indulges in sounds without fatigue,
they lose their acuity.
Though the mouth can taste, if one exhausts itself in flavors without end,
it perverts its nourishment—
thus, it becomes dulled.
Yet "blindness" is defined by not seeing,
"deafness" by not hearing.
To have eyes yet not see the True Person and Great Sage—this is blindness.
To have ears yet not hear the vast music of the subtle
or the subtle, wondrous spiritual sounds—this is deafness.
The mouth’s purpose is to discern flavors,
but if one craves mundane tastes and loses the flavor of the Dao/Way,
thus it is said to be dulled.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
The five colors blind the eyes—
the five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black.
If one cannot internally illuminate the true source
but instead chases external dusty realms,
though they see the colors of empty space,
they say it is not blindness—
what difference is there between not seeing and blindness?

The five sounds deafen the ears—
the five sounds are *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*.
If the heart is entangled in strings and bamboo,
the ears are clogged by *gong* and *shang*,
unable to return and hear the subtle sounds—
thus, it is called deafness.
As *Zhuangzi* says:
Not only does the form and body have blindness and deafness—
wisdom also has them.

The five flavors dull the palate—
the five flavors are sweet, bitter, spicy, sour, and salty.
*"Dull"* means "erroneous."
If one indulges in wine and strong drinks,
chews on rancid and gamey meats,
unable to savor the Dao/Way or discuss the mysterious,
thus it is said the mouth is dulled.

**2. The faculties are stained by dusty realms—one must be urged to stillness.**

Galloping and hunting drive the mind to madness.

**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**
Galloping and hunting are worldly pursuits—
like hunting, one is obsessed with killing and capturing.
As *Zhuangzi* says:
Daily, the heart wages battle,
chasing realms and galloping—
if one reflects in stillness, it is the disease of madness.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
This speaks of those entangled in sounds and colors,
their desires galloping like hunters—
only seeking to kill and capture,
their desires raging, chasing realms like a gallop.
If one observes them in stillness, it is the disease of madness.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
Human spirit naturally seeks tranquility,
but galloping and panting disperse the spirit,
thus madness arises.

**Master Yan says:**
Those who delight in the variations of hunting
cannot escape confusion and delusion—
hunting is the teacher of madness.

**Master Rong says:**
To indulge in fishing and hunting is to lose the business of Great Peace,
to hunt for fame and reputation is to incur the illness of Zhang Yi.
The loss of life and state—this is the greatest madness.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
"Galloping" means "racing."
Those who hunt are greedy for beasts,
their hearts delighted and unrestrained—
like madmen.
Those who invert principles, their desires chasing realms,
move swiftly like galloping,
mad as hunters.
As *Zhuangzi* says:
There are five ways to lose one’s nature—
the first is that the five colors confuse the eyes,
causing them to lose their clarity, and so on.

Hard-to-obtain treasures obstruct one’s path.

**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**
These are things beyond one’s natural endowment—
though sought, they cannot be obtained.
Foolishly pursuing what is unattainable
thus obstructs the path of the Dao/Way.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
"Hard-to-obtain treasures" refers to those who
regard vulgar possessions as treasures.
What is hard to obtain is what lies beyond one’s natural endowment—
though sought, it cannot be attained.

---

Those who fail to abide in their natural endowment,
twisting their nature to seek recklessly—
once they stray beyond Heaven’s decree,
this obstructs the practice of the Dao/Way.

**River Master’s Commentary:**
*"Obstruct"* means *"harm."*

"Hard-to-obtain treasures" refers to gold, silver, pearls, and jade.
When the heart is covetous and desires know no bound,
one’s practice is injured and brings shame to the body.

**Yan’s Commentary:**
Greed for wealth’s manifold forms
inevitably leads to corrupt inclinations.

Wealth is the ruin of one’s foundation.

**Li Rong’s Commentary:**
Beautiful women and precious gems—
these are the hard-to-obtain treasures.
They disrupt the heart and harm one’s practice.

**Master Cheng’s Citation:**
"Hard-to-obtain treasures" refers to the *Zhao Bi* jade and *Sui Zhu* pearl—
rare and splendid treasures.
To cling and indulge in them
is the root of birth-and-death,
greatly hindering Daoist cultivation.

Thus, the Sage distinguishes between the belly and the eyes:
he acts for the belly, not for the eyes.
Hence, he discards the one and embraces the other.

**Imperial Commentary:**
The belly receives without discrimination;
the eyes are ensnared by the dust of colors.
Without discrimination, harmony is complete—
thus, he acts for the belly.
To be ensnared by colors harms one’s nature—
thus, he does not act for the eyes.
Hence, he discards the eyes’ deluded gaze
and embraces the belly’s nurturing of nature.

**River Master’s Commentary:**
Therefore, the Sage acts for the belly,
preserving the Five Natures,
discarding the Six Emotions,
moderating will and breath,
nourishing spirit and clarity.
He does not act for the eyes,
lest they gaze in vain and dissipate vital essence outward.
Thus, he discards the eyes’ deluded gaze
and embraces the belly’s cultivation of nature.

**Yan’s Commentary:**
The Sage wears the color of no-color,
listens to the sound of no-sound,
tastes the flavor of no-flavor,
rides the boundless realm,
traverses the limitless expanse,
casts the formless net,
and attains the heart of Dao/virtue.

**Li Rong’s Commentary:**
The empty heart is inwardly full—
this is the belly.
To return hearing without blindness—
this is not the eyes.
To abandon burdensome deeds,
to welcome the Way of Non-Action.

**Master Cheng’s Citation:**
Thus, the Sage acts for the belly, not the eyes—
this continues from the earlier distinction between the Sage and the common man.
The belly is the inner self; the eyes, the outer.
Embracing Dao/virtue and power within,
filling the inner—this is the belly.
To perceive no colors inwardly, to return hearing to no-sounds,
all senses purified, unstained by dust—
this is not the eyes.
Hence, he discards the blindness and deafness of the eyes
and embraces the belly’s true wisdom.

**Chapter Thirteen: The Chapter on Honor and Humiliation as Cause for Alarm**

This chapter follows the previous because the prior chapter examined the false nature of root-and-dust teachings.
Thus, this chapter clarifies that returning to the body is itself a calamity.

Within this chapter, there are three distinctions:
First, it broadly states that honor and humiliation are equally perilous;
Second, it poses hypothetical questions to explain why;
Third, it weighs the value of wealth to reveal its gains and losses.

**First Distinction: Honor and Humiliation Are Equally Perilous**

To surpass the sovereign in honor is to exceed the Nine Ranks,
while the path of death lies in the Thirteen Offenses.
Thus, the two paths of honor and humiliation are opened,
revealing the delusion of all sentient beings.

A household’s splendor—
the mighty bearing great caps and long swords,
the grandeur of rank and office—
those who wear swords and trailing ribbons—
how could they know that a single merit of obscurity
brings ruin to noble kin?
Thus, Huo Guang’s anxiety from thorny suspicions,
Yang Dan’s downfall from a single bean’s worth of error.

The Master of Lao warns: *"Honor and humiliation must be met with alarm."*
Reflect, O common man—
your heart cannot discern:
entering the court without reward,
exiting in honor yet ever at ease—
this is why the minister’s favor turns to enmity,
for it is the key to the executioner’s blade.

**Honor and humiliation must be met with alarm.**

**Imperial Commentary:**
To hold honor brings trembling;
to lose it brings sorrow.
As long as one does not forget honor and humiliation,
both inspire alarm.

**Imperial Citation:**
*"If"* means *"as."*
It states that the alarm of honor and humiliation is equal.

When one holds honor, it is honor;
when one loses it, it is humiliation.
It means that people cannot equalize their hearts to honor and humiliation—
they boast in their achievements, cling to power,
and when in office, they revel in glory,
but when fallen, they suffer the shame of disgrace.
Thus, the warning is given to make them tremble,
urging them to equalize their response to honor and humiliation.

**River Master’s Commentary:**
To be honored is alarming;
to be humiliated is alarming.

**Li Rong’s Commentary:**
High office brings fear of danger;
low station brings shame—
both are fears.

**Master Cheng’s Citation:**
*"Honor"* is the name for delight and love;
*"humiliation"* is the term for disgrace and shame.
*"If"* means *"as";*
*"alarm"* means *"fear."*
When one gains honor, one is carefree and joyous;
when one suffers humiliation, one is fearful and anxious.
Thus, gaining honor fills the heart with joyful alarm,
suffering humiliation fills the heart with fearful alarm.
Though joy and fear differ,
both are forms of alarm—
hence, *"as."*

Yet these emotions of joy and fear
are not the true nature.
Thus, the enlightened compare prosperity and adversity to cold and heat,
equate honor and humiliation to transient occurrences—
unshaken by life and death,
how could noble and base status alarm them?

**Wealth is a great peril to the body.**

**Imperial Commentary:**
The body is the foundation of breath—
thus, one treasures the body as one treasures great breath.
The phrase *"wealth is a great peril to the body"* is combined with *"to treasure the body as great breath,"*
yet it states *"to treasure great breath as the body"*—
this is to clarify that when the mind arises to blame the body,
it is itself the great breath.
If there is wealth, then the body is the great breath;
thus, *"to treasure great breath as the body."*

*"If"* means *"as."* The two preceding sentences are the main point.

「○ **Imperial Commentary:**
*"Noble"* means to hold in high regard.
*"If"* means *"as."*

The body is the source of the great peril of breath.
Those who indulge in sounds and colors,
who vie for honor and wealth—
all do so because of the body,
thus making the body the root of affliction.

If one truly treasures the body,
what else could be more precious?
Yet it is the source of great peril.
For the body is breath itself—
no distinction exists between them.
If one cannot be free from peril,
it is because of the body.
Thus, to treasure the body is the same as treasuring great peril.
If one could abandon breath,
one would also forget the body.
This shows that peril arises from what is held noble,
and the body is the root of affliction—
hence, *"wealth is a great peril to the body."*

○ **Master He Shang** said:
One returns to question oneself,
thus fearing the great breath reaching the body.

○ **Master Rong** said:
Those who disregard the body find gain and loss hard to alarm,
but those who treasure the body are easily startled by honor and humiliation.
If one treasures the body,
then great peril arises—
thus, it is said, *"wealth is a great peril to the body."*

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*"Noble"* refers to rank and status,
which is also to hold oneself in high regard.
*"Great peril"* refers to afflictions—
old age, sickness, and so forth.
Common people know only to prize this body
and despise the great breath,
yet they fail to see that the great breath *is* the body.
By seeking resources and sustenance,
they inevitably lead to decay and ruin.
Thus, to treasure the body is to treasure peril,
and to reject peril is to reject the body—
for both nobility and great peril
take the body as their foundation.
Hence, *"as."*

This is a second hypothetical question,
clarifying the reasoning behind it.

What is meant by *"honor and humiliation"*?
*"Honor"* is the lesser.

**Imperial Commentary:**
The passage earlier equates honor and humiliation to alarm,
lest people fail to understand,
so it asks: What is meant by *"honor and humiliation"*?
It answers itself: *"Honor"* is the lesser.
This clarifies that honor is the lesser because
those who rely on honor become arrogant and inflated,
and arrogance inevitably brings misfortune.
Since misfortune arises from honor,
honor is the root of humiliation—
thus, *"honor"* is the lesser.

○ **Imperial Commentary:**
The passage earlier equates honor and humiliation to alarm,
lest people fail to comprehend,
so it poses the question: What is meant by *"honor and humiliation"*?
It answers itself: *"Honor"* is the lesser.
The reason honor is lesser is this:
those who depend on honor become arrogant and inflated,
and arrogance breeds disaster.
Misfortune follows from honor,
so honor is the root of humiliation—
thus, *"honor"* is the lesser.

○ **Master He Shang** said:
What is meant by *"honor and humiliation"*?
It asks: What is *"honor"*? What is *"humiliation"*?
*"Honor"* is the love of glory,
*"humiliation"* is shame upon the body.
One returns to question oneself
to enlighten others.
*"Honor"* is lowly,
*"humiliation"* is lowly and base.

○ **Master Rong** said:
What is meant by *"honor and humiliation"*?
It raises the question, answering that *"honor"* is lowly.
*"Honor"* should be called high,
*"humiliation"* should be called low,
yet here it states *"honor"* is low—
this implies that if one understands *"honor"* as low,
then *"humiliation"* as high is naturally clear.
It does not elaborate fully but briefly states:
In the world, people love glory and wealth,
treating honor as high—
yet high status brings near danger,
and glory brings humiliation.
Thus, *"honor"* is low.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
What is meant by *"honor and humiliation"*?
This is a hypothetical question.
*"Honor"* is lowly—
to gain it is alarming,
to lose it is alarming—
this explains its meaning.
Human nature is inverted:
they consider honor high,
but with enlightened insight, it is truly base.
Why?
Because gaining honor fills one with joyful alarm,
losing it fills one with fearful alarm.
These two alarms
originate from the same *"honor,"*
so it is called low.

To gain it is alarming,
to lose it is alarming—
this is what is meant by *"honor and humiliation as alarm."*

**Imperial Commentary:**
Honor is gained, humiliation is lost—
*"as alarm"* means that honor and humiliation cycle endlessly,
so honor is the root of humiliation.
Between lifetimes, beings
rejoice at honor and fear humiliation,
so the Sage warns:
*"When you gain honor, regard it as if you had gained humiliation and were alarmed,
then when you lose honor and gain humiliation,
you will also follow my warning—
be alarmed as if you had gained honor."*
Thus, the scripture says: *"This is what is meant by honor and humiliation as alarm."*

○ **Imperial Commentary:**
When one gains, it is honor;
when one loses, it is humiliation—
*"as alarm"* means that honor and humiliation cycle endlessly,
so honor is the root of humiliation.
Between lifetimes, beings
rejoice at honor and fear humiliation,
so the Sage warns:
*"Like ink spilled in disorder,
honor and humiliation are unstable—
why alarm at only one?"*
When humiliation comes, one is alarmed by its perilous breath;
when honor arrives, one is alarmed by arrogance and ease.
The alarms are equal,
thus the scripture says: *"This is what is meant by honor and humiliation as alarm."*

○ **Master He Shang** said:
To gain it is alarming—
*"gain"* means honor and glory,
*"alarming"* means standing in high position as if in danger,
noble yet not daring to be arrogant,
rich yet not daring to be extravagant.
To lose it is alarming—
*"lose"* means losing honor and facing humiliation,
*"alarming"* means fearing renewed misfortune.
This is what is meant by *"honor and humiliation as alarm,"*
explaining the earlier *"to gain it is alarming, to lose it is alarming."*

○ **Master Rong** said:
Honor brings glory,
humiliation brings aid.
Whether gained or lost,
both fill one with alarm—
only those of empty tranquility
are unshaken in their thoughts.
This is what is meant by *"honor and humiliation as alarm,"*
concluding the preceding meaning.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*"This is what is meant by honor and humiliation as alarm,"*
concluding the meaning of humiliation and honor.

What is meant by *"wealth is a great peril to the body"*?

**Imperial Commentary:**
Lest people fail to grasp that the body is the root of breath,
it asks this.

○ **Master He Shang** said:
One returns to question oneself,
thus fearing the great breath reaching the body.

○ **Master Rong** said:
A question is posed.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
A hypothetical question.
Why do I have great peril?
Because I have a body.

**Imperial Commentary:**
The body’s form is empty and illusory,
yet it is the root of affliction
because I cling to having a body—
pain, itching, cold, and heat—
thus, it is the source of bodily affliction.

○ **Imperial Commentary:**
Why do I have this great peril?
Because I cling to the body’s form,
love glory, hate humiliation,
distinguish right and wrong,
and when I do not obtain what I desire,
I am filled with great anxiety and fear.
My mind and spirit are internally exhausted by craving,
my form is externally strained by competition—
laboring and enslaved, what else could it be but affliction?

○ **Master He Shang** said:
Why do I have great peril?
Because I have a body—
then I fear movement and toil,
ponder hunger and cold,
follow emotions and desires,
and thus encounter the great peril of breath and the dissolution of glory.

The body is burdened with the diseases of flourishing and decay,
and the calamity of life and death—
thus, it is called *"great peril."*»

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
This responds to the prior question.
Clinging to my body, unable to forget or release it,
makes bodily suffering the root of great affliction—
thus one knows that valuing the body is no different from suffering.
Hence the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:
*"The body is the source of vexation;
pain, itch, cold, and heat—
I am bound by the body,
and thus know it as great affliction."*

When I have no body, what affliction could I have?
**Imperial Commentary:**
He who knows that heaven and earth are in harmonious accord,
and none of it belongs to me—
abandoning form, discarding wisdom,
realizing the body is not the body,
uniting with the Dao—
what affliction could there be?

**Imperial Commentary (expanded):**
*"No body"* means one who comprehends the body’s form as empty and illusory,
itself not real—
then one must sit in *zuowang* (sitting-forgetting), abandoning perception,
collapsing the body, discarding hearing,
merging with the boundless Dao’s non-attachment,
aligning with heaven and earth’s non-possession—
naturally, the paths of honor and disgrace vanish,
and the hearts of love and hatred cease.
This is what is meant by *"the Emperor’s suspended resolution"*—
what further bondage to great affliction could there be?
Thus it is said: *When I have no body, what affliction could I have?*
The note on *"commit and accord"* comes from Zhuangzi’s response to Shun:
*"The body is not yours—it is heaven and earth’s committed accord."*

**Master He Shang** said:
If I have no body, and attain the Dao naturally,
lightly ascending to the clouds,
entering and exiting without obstruction,
communing with the Dao—
what affliction could there be?

**Master Yan** said:
Rest the mind in Dao and virtue,
record the will in spirit and clarity—
harmony is the central master,
serene as if unborn,
a plan beyond planning,
crafting heaven and earth,
a concern beyond concern,
soaring in the boundless dark,
preserving and forgetting in transformation—
not distinguishing these as strange.
Honor and disgrace, high and low—
no excess, no deficiency.
Valuing the great, it perishes in the body—
thus great affliction cannot take hold,
nor can the heavenly net ensnare.

**Master Rong** said:
Emptying oneself, forgetting the heart—
this is having no body.
The afflictions of right and wrong arise from the body;
if the body is forgotten,
then death and life cannot burden,
honor and disgrace cannot disturb—
what affliction could there be?

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
It is only because of *having* that the body becomes affliction;
if the body is already nonexistent,
where could affliction lodge?
Thus, *I have no body, where would affliction attach?*
The *"nonexistent"* refers to *zuowang*, losing the self,
collapsing the body, abandoning form—
this is the body having no body.
*"Nonexistent"* is not annihilation, but simply *nonexistent*.

The third comparison reveals gain and loss in valuation.
Thus, *valuing the body as the world*
is like being able to entrust the world to it.
*Loving the body as the world*
is like being able to commit the world to it.

**Imperial Commentary:**
This chapter first warns against honor and disgrace,
then concludes with entrustment—
if one is startled by honor and disgrace,
it means one has not forgotten honor and disgrace,
has not forgotten valuation and love.
Thus, comparing disgrace to honor,
disgrace is not as grave as honor;
comparing love to valuation,
valuation is not as deep as love.
Those startled by honor and disgrace
still harbor concern for honor and disgrace,
and those who retain valuation and love
have not yet forgotten the world entirely.
Thus, first it makes one startled by honor and disgrace,
then it seeks to make one forget both honor and disgrace—
using the name of entrustment
to distinguish the extreme of forgetting,
forgetting honor and disgrace,
having nothing left to startle,
forgetting the body means no root of affliction,
forgetting the world means no pretension of entrustment.
Only then does one have the *Supreme Sovereign* above
and the *Submissive Minister* below—
doing nothing yet achieving all,
having no virtue yet possessing virtue.

**Imperial Commentary (expanded):**
The ruler who prizes his body as the world’s master,
deeming himself above others,
risks being temporarily entrusted with the world,
but not enduring.
If the ruler loves his body as the world’s master,
not for himself but for the people—
as their parent—
then his virtue can entrust his body to the people,
ruling forever without answer.

**Master Rong** said:
The Supreme Sovereign values virtue, not the body;
the enlightened king loves the people, not himself.
If one can do this,
then one can endure.
If one values the body and belittles others,
loves oneself while hating others,
one cannot align with heaven and earth’s benevolence,
equal the sun and moon’s illumination—
then it is only a temporary entrustment.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Thus, *valuing the body as the world*
is like being able to entrust the world to it—
yet one does not know the body is great affliction,
proudly valuing it,
always seeking to dominate others.
Such a person may temporarily reside in the world,
but cannot long govern it.
*Loving the body as the world*
is like being able to commit the world to it—
*"entrust"* means temporary lodging,
*"commit"* means enduring attachment.
If one preserves himself with humility,
submissively yielding to others,
then he can transform the world—
hence the *Classic of Virtue* says: *"Love yourself, but do not exalt yourself."*

---
**Chapter 14: The Chapter on "Seeing It Unseen"**
This chapter follows the previous one
because the prior chapter directly posits the body as great affliction,
warning against indulgence.
This chapter reveals the subtle, mysterious body,
encouraging cultivation—
first diagnosing the illness, then prescribing the remedy—
hence its placement.

**Chapter 14: The Chapter on "Seeing It Unseen"**

This chapter’s meaning is divided into six parts.
1. It clarifies that *non-duality is unity*—
   how the singular is dispersed into the three.
2. It clarifies that *non-triplicity is triplicity*—
   how the three are merged into the singular.
3. It reveals that the **Dao/Way** is neither foolish nor wise**,
   transcending all named speech.
4. It shows that the subtle body** manifests myriad colors and sounds,
   yet responds to nothing in fixed form.
5. It demonstrates that it is *neither non-existence nor existence*,
   neither ancient nor modern.
6. It reveals that it is *both ancient and modern*,
   the guiding principle and the fundamental thread.

The first part clarifies that *non-duality is unity*—
   how the singular is dispersed into the three.

The profound **Dao/Way** is deep and hidden,
its vast source unfathomable.
It spans the three heavens** yet is rarely seen,
ascends the eight realms** yet is hard to find.
Like a chicken egg before its divisions,
one looks up to the **Dragon** yet cannot perceive it.
Faint and obscure, dark and silent,
its essence eludes all grasping—
thus the Yellow Emperor lost it at Kunqiu**,
and Emperor Yao sought it in Gushan**,
neither born nor extinguished,
transcending the ten thousand ages yet enduring,
without color or form,
piercing the Three Pure Ones** and emerging first.

From its origin descending to its traces,
it unfolds countless wondrous paths.
The heavens and earth **qi** swirl in harmony,
opening the **Hall of Creation** to extend its domain.
It displays the **True Scripture** in the **Jade Box**,
encompassing all beings within the **Treasure Pearl**.
Thus, Liu An summoned the Eight Immortals**,
the Queen Mother gained the service of the Twin Boys**,
Madame Ma paused in conversation,
pointing to the three shifts of the sea’s waters,
and Ding Ling sang his farewell,
knowing his homeland had changed once.
The wondrous applications of the **Dao/Way** are vast indeed!

The term **"Seeing It Unseen"** is called *Yi* (夷).
*Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:
This is the **Dao/Way** revealed.

「夷」 is called *Yi*—smooth and simple. The **Dao/Way** is not a color, so it cannot be seen. Yet within the realm of no-color, it can manifest all colors; thus, it is named *Yi*.

○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:
This passage elucidates the **Dao/Way**. Those who seek to see it do so through color, those who seek to hear it do so through sound, and those who seek to grasp it do so through form. But the **Dao/Way** is neither color, sound, nor form—thus, all such seeking fails.

Because it cannot be obtained through such means, one might say it is "nonexistent." Yet within no-color, it manifests all colors; within no-sound, it harmonizes all sounds; within no-form, it assumes all forms. Thus, it possesses *Yi*—color without color, *Xi*—sound without sound, and *Wei*—form without form. Therefore, it is called *Yi Xi Wei*.

*Yi Xi Wei* refers to what is called "illuminating the **Dao/Way** but not the **Dao/Way** itself." *Yi* is smooth and simple. *Xi* is the subtle and profound nature of sound. *Wei* is the grasp of form.

○ *Master He Shang* said:
*"Yi"* means no-color—one without hues, unseen yet perceived. It cannot be grasped through sight alone.

○ *Rong* said:
Is the **Dao/Way** distant? The eyes cannot see it. Yet the sage comprehends it, perceiving its clarity alone, and thus names it *Yi*. *Yi* is plainness; the Great **Dao/Way** is utterly simple, naturally good and effortlessly wise.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Commentary*:
*"Yi"* means plainness—speaking of the ultimate subtlety of the **Dao/Way**, its essence transcends the five colors, so it cannot be discerned by the eyes. Thus, it is called *Yi*—smooth and equal, without variation.

Hearing it yet not hearing is called *Xi*.
○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:
*Xi* is the subtle sound. The **Dao/Way** is not sound, so it cannot be heard. Yet within no-sound, it alone harmonizes all sounds; thus, it is named *Xi*.

○ *Master He Shang* said:
*"Xi"* means no-sound—one without audible tones, yet heard through the spirit.

○ *Rong* said:
The Great Sound is subtle without voice; the ears cannot hear it. Yet the sage penetrates its depths, hearing its harmony alone. It is called *Xi*—profound and elusive, teaching hard to encounter. *Xi* is the natural way.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Commentary*:
*Xi* means simplicity and fewness—its essence is not the notes of the five tones, so it cannot be grasped by the ear. Thus, it is called *Xi*—the subtle.

Touching it yet not obtaining is called *Wei*.
○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:
*Wei* is the grasp of form. The **Dao/Way** has no shape, so it cannot be held. Yet within no-form, it alone assumes all forms; thus, it is named *Wei*.

○ *Master He Shang* said:
*"Wei"* means no-form—one without tangible substance, yet perceived through spirit alone. It cannot be grasped by touch.

○ *Rong* said:
The Great Symbol is formless, hard to touch. Yet the sage’s profound insight knows the void, and thus *Wei* is the subtle mechanism. It moves and responds to things, surpassing all distinctions of existence and non-existence.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Commentary*:
*Wei* means subtle and wondrous—its essence is not corporeal, so it cannot be touched. Thus, it is called *Wei*—the subtle and wondrous.

Again, *Master Zang*’s threefold unity refers to *spirit-qi-essence* (神炁精). *Spirit* (精) is the name for luminous wisdom, *God* (神) is the function beyond measure, and *Qi* (炁) is the aspect of form. The sage unites these three into one.

If it is unseen, that is *spirit*; if unheard, that is *God*; if untouchable, that is *Qi*. Yet since it is unseen, unheard, and untouchable, one might say it is no-color and no-form. But why then speak of *Yi Xi Wei*?

The ultimate **Dao/Way** is indeed without color, yet it does not utterly vanish. If it vanished entirely, it would merge with the *Great Void* (太虚), leading to a denial of perception. Now, it is named *Yi Xi Wei*—color without color, sound without sound, form without form—thus the term.

The second meaning is: though three, it is one; though one, it is three. These three cannot be questioned, so they are merged into one.

○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:
These three—*Yi Xi Wei*—are meant to question the **Dao/Way**, but the **Dao/Way** is neither sound, color, nor form. Thus, questioning yields no answer, and only *Yi Xi Wei* is obtained. The **Dao/Way** is not *Yi Xi Wei*, so the three are merged into one.

○ *Commentary by the Master of the Mysteries*:
These three—*Yi Xi Wei*—cannot be questioned. *Zhi* (致) means to obtain, *Jie* (诘) means to interrogate, and *Hun* (混) means to merge. The wondrous origin is subtle and profound; *spirit-qi-essence* are hard to name. How can one interrogate with color, sound, and form?

If one interrogates with color, sound, and form, only *Yi Xi Wei* is obtained. Yet if one calls it *Yi Xi Wei*, it is but a borrowed name. To truly reveal the **Dao/Way**, one must know that it is not sound, color, or form—thus, *Yi Xi Wei* is merged into one.

○ *Master He Shang* said:
These three cannot be questioned—*Yi Xi Wei*. The mouth cannot speak of them, nor can scriptures transmit them. They are received with stillness, sought with spirit, and cannot be interrogated to obtain. Thus, they are merged into one. *Hun* means to combine, so the three are combined into one name.

○ *Rong* said:
*Yi Xi Wei* are the three. All are beyond sound and color, transcending form and name, so they cannot be questioned or measured. Merged into the undifferentiated, they are named as one. One is not self-made one; it arises from the three. Three is not self-made three; it arises from the one. From one arises three, yet three is one-three. From three arises one, yet one is three-one.

One does not become one, so three does not become three. Only when three does not become three is there no three. One does not become one, so there is no one. Without one and without three, it aligns with the logic of speechlessness. Grasping one or three stifles the flow of profound understanding.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Commentary*:
These three are *Yi Xi Wei*. *Zhi* (致) means to obtain, *Jie* (诘) means to interrogate, and *Hun* (混) means to combine. The true and responsive are one, yet they manifest as three teachings. The meaning is fully explained in the opening passage.

Again, another interpretation: the true and responsive **Dao/Way** itself assumes three forms of teaching. Their meaning is already present in the opening passage.

The third chapter reveals the Dao/Way as beyond the grasp of both foolishness and wisdom, transcending all named speech. Its upper reaches are not luminous, its lower depths are not obscure.

**御注 (Imperial Annotation):**
Those above must be luminous, those below must be obscure. Yet the Dao/Way, though above, is not above; though above, it is not luminous. Though below, it is not below; though below, it is not obscure.

**御疏 (Imperial Commentary):**
*Jiao* (皎) means luminous; *mei* (昧) means dark. All things of form and substance have fixed places—those above are luminous, those below are dark. Yet the wondrous origin is hazy and indistinct, defying definition. Thus, though above, it is not luminous; though below, it is not obscure. Yet it can be above and below, luminous and obscure, unless one attains the utmost subtlety of the world—who else could comprehend this?

**River Upper Master (河上公) says:**
Its upper reaches are not luminous—speaking of the One in the heavens, not dazzling with brilliance. The Dao/Way extends without limit above and below.
Its lower depths are not obscure—speaking of the One in the world below, not shrouded in darkness.

**Master Rong (荣) says:**
Its upper reaches are not luminous, its lower depths are not obscure—
*Chengcheng* (乘乘), like drifting without anchor.
The Dao/Way rides the myriad things yet remains unattached.
It cannot be named luminous or obscure, neither color nor sound,
Yet it can be perceived by sight and hearing.
When the subtle and lofty principle is still, the three-one’s essence is empty—
Transcending all things, it returns to nothingness.
What does "nothingness" return to if nothing exists?
One must know the void itself is void—
This is the profound beyond the profound, the boundless beyond bounds.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):**
*Jiao* (皎) means luminous; *mei* (昧) means dark.
The supreme Dao/Way is so subtle that it is neither foolishness nor wisdom.
Ascending beyond the Three Purities, it does not increase its luminosity;
Descending into the Nine Abysses, it does not deepen its obscurity—
This is the "neither increase nor decrease," found here.

*Chengcheng* (绳绳) is beyond naming, returning to nothingness.
**御注 (Imperial Annotation):**
*Chengcheng* signifies unceasing motion.
Neither luminous nor obscure, its motion is boundless—
The function of giving birth to things cannot be named,
Yet it constantly generates life without ever being a thing itself.
The wondrous origin is serene and profound—
Thus it returns to nothingness.

**御疏 (Imperial Commentary):**
*Chengcheng* signifies unceasing motion.
The wondrous origin generates and transforms, its motion boundless.
The function of giving birth to things cannot be forcibly named—
It things things without being a thing,
It generates without being generation.
To seek it is futile—its origin is serene and profound,
Never having been a thing—
Thus it returns to nothingness.

**River Upper Master (河上公) says:**
*Chengcheng* is beyond naming—*chengcheng* means motion without end.
It cannot be named as a single color—
Not distinguishable by blue, yellow, red, white, or black.
It is not a single sound—
Not discernible by the five musical notes.
It is not a single form—
Not measurable by length, shortness, greatness, or smallness.
To return to nothingness—*wu* (物) means substance—
It must return to the formless.

**Master Yan (严) says:**
Deep and drifting, returning to the void—
Curving to form the myriad things, all preserved.
Exhausting the subtle and attaining the marvelous—
All is thus realized.
Flowing above and below, none can perceive its absence.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):**
*Chengcheng* means upright, like the straightedge and plumb line.
The Sage, having governed himself, also governs others—
Thus it cannot be grasped by names or sought in reason—
Hence it is beyond naming.
Another interpretation: *chengcheng* depicts motion—
The supreme Dao/Way turns the heavens and earth, molding living beings,
Yet sight and hearing cannot trace it—
Thus it is beyond naming.
*Fùguī* (复归) means returning to the source.
*Wúwù* (无物) refers to the wondrous origin.
When responding to circumstances and descending into traces,
It becomes visible and audible.
Yet returning to its root, it is nameless and formless—
Thus it returns to nothingness.

The fourth chapter: Though not color or sound, it responds to things without form.
This is called the *zhuàng* (状) of the formless, the *xiàng* (象) of the formless—
This is called *hūhuǎng* (惚恍).

**御注 (Imperial Annotation):**
This is the *zhuàng* of the formless, the *xiàng* of the formless substance—
It cannot be named as having, nor as not having.
The difficulty of naming the non-existent—
Thus it is called *hūhuǎng*.

**御疏 (Imperial Commentary):**
*Zhuàng* means form; *xiàng* means appearance.
The wondrous origin is mixed and complete—
Originally without form or substance,
Yet all transformations draw from it, and things flow into forms.
Thus it can be called the *zhuàng* of the formless,
The *xiàng* of the formless substance—
It cannot be named as having, nor confined to non-existence.
The difficulty of naming the non-existent—
Thus it is called *hūhuǎng*.

**River Upper Master (河上公) says:**
This is the *zhuàng* of the formless—
The One has no form, yet it shapes all things.
The *xiàng* of the formless—
The One has no substance, yet it establishes all appearances.
This is called *hūhuǎng*—
The One is hazy and indistinct, as if existing and vanishing,
Not visible.

**Master Yan (严) says:**
The *zhuàng* of the formless is without limit in its forming;
The *xiàng* of the formless is without limit in its appearing.
Illuminating in *hūhuǎng*, it reveals all—
Great yet appearing small, existing yet appearing nonexistent.

**Master Rong (荣) says:**
Transcending the existent and returning to the nonexistent—
The nonexistent has no color.
Perceived by sight and hearing, it aligns with the subtle and lofty—
When the subtle and lofty become still, fear arises for those lost on the path,
Who cling to the formless, showing the astray the way back.
Further opening the *zhuàng* of the formless—
This arises from essence and manifests function.
The *xiàng* of the formless is self-responsive and returns to truth—
Self-responsive and returning to truth, it gathers traces and returns to the root.
From essence arises function—this is the motion of stillness.
The motion of stillness speaks of its non-existence—
Suddenly, there is existence.
Gathering traces and returning to the root speaks of its existence—
Suddenly, there is non-existence.
Suddenly non-existent—this is fixed non-existence.
Suddenly existent—this is not fixed existence.
Existence and non-existence in *hūhuǎng*—none can name it.

「○ Master Cheng’s Commentary: This is the *zhuàng* of the formless, the *xiàng* of the non-existent.
The formless can yet manifest transformation—hence its *xiàng* is called *zhuàng*.
The fifth insight reveals neither non-existence nor existence, neither antiquity nor modernity.
迎之不見其首，隨之不見其後。
迎之者 cannot perceive its beginning, 隨之者 cannot perceive its end.

○ Master Yu’s Commentary: Without origin, hence迎之者 cannot perceive its beginning.
無終，故隨之者不得其後。
Without termination, hence 隨之者 cannot perceive its end.

○ Master Yu’s Commentary: The utmost subtlety is formless, the utmost vastness can encompass all.
Hence迎之者 cannot perceive its beginning, 隨之者 cannot perceive its end.
無首則無始，無後即無終。
Without beginning, there is no origin; without end, there is no termination.
無始無終，故非隨迎所得也。
Without origin or termination, it is not what迎之者 or 隨之者 can grasp.

○ Lord of Héshàng said: The one without shadow or trace—this may be seen and known.

○ Róng said: Existence has a beginning that can be approached, non-existence has an end that can be traced.
迎不見，非有。
If it cannot be迎ed, it is not existence.
隨之不見，非無也。
If it cannot be隨ed, it is not non-existence.

○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:迎 cannot perceive its beginning—this reveals the Dao is neither ancient nor originless.
隨不見其後—this reveals the Dao is neither modern nor endless.

The sixth insight clarifies that the ancient and the modern are its guiding principles and threads.
执古之道，以御今之有。
To grasp the ancient Dao of non-action (*wúwéi*) and apply it to the present state of action (*yǒuwéi*)—
○ Master Yu’s Commentary: To grasp the ancient Dao of non-action and apply it to the present affairs of action,
then one returns to the simplicity of the pristine.

○ Master Yu’s Commentary: This insight clarifies the ancient sovereigns,
who could transform through the Dao of non-action and thereby transform others.
Hence, the admonition urges one to uphold the ancient practice of non-action,
to govern the present affairs of action—
then speech is not needed for transformation to occur.

○ Lord of Héshàng said: The Sage holds fast to the ancient Dao,
generates the one to govern all things,
and knows that in the present there must also be the one.

○ Róng said: 御 is to rectify.
The ancient Dao of non-action is rectification.
The modern Dao of action is sagacity.
The Sage upholds the Dao of non-action to rectify action,
to still the trend of superficiality and return to the harmonious transformation of the pristine.

○ Master Cheng’s Commentary: 执 is to hold.
This speaks of the Sage holding the Dao of the primordial antiquity—
when names had not yet arisen—
and adjusting the present state of existence.

To know the ancient origin is called the Dao’s guiding principles and threads.
○ Master Yu’s Commentary: To know the ancient origin and its practices—
this is called the guiding principles and threads of Daoist transformation.

○ Master Yu’s Commentary: Earlier it was said, "To grasp the ancient Dao"—
this was to lead and guide it in practice.
Here it is said, "To know the ancient origin"—
this clarifies that the Dao’s practice must inevitably transform.
Hence, it is reiterated that sovereigns of old knew the ancient origin,
governed through non-action, and thus embraced the simplicity of the pristine.
Those who could achieve clarity and stillness—
this is knowing the guiding principles and threads of the Dao for governance.

○ Lord of Héshàng said: If a person knows the Dao of the upper antiquity,
the origin is one—this is called knowing the guiding principles and threads of the Dao.

○ Yán said: To grasp the ancient Dao naturally and apply it to the present,
not altering for barbarians, then it does not change for the Central States.
One knows the beginning through the one, one knows the end through the one,
governing by the Dao—all things hang suspended from it,
it dominates all, it oversees all.
Its role is vast and great—
nothing it does not govern.
It is the guiding principles and threads of emptiness,
the ancestral origin of heaven and earth.

○ Róng said: The Dao of the mysterious antiquity is difficult to know,
the Dao of non-action is rarely comprehended.
Above, it rectifies below; below, it follows above to eliminate—
this is the essential principle of attaining the Dao.

○ Master Cheng’s Commentary: The ancient origin is the Dao without name.
If one knows that it has neither beginning nor end,
yet it ends and begins,
neither antiquity nor modernity,
yet it is ancient and modern—
to apply this ancient Dao to the present world,
one may be called the guiding principles and threads of the utmost Dao.

**The Fifteenth Chapter: The Ancient Sage Who Skillfully Practices the Dao**
The reason this chapter follows the previous is that the previous chapter
established the refined state of cultivation as subtly lofty (*xīyí*),
while this chapter reveals the profound and elusive wisdom of those who can cultivate it.
The union of state and wisdom—this is why it follows.

Now, within this chapter, three distinctions are opened.

The first clarifies those who can cultivate the Dao—
their wisdom and virtue are profound and far-reaching.
The second emphasizes their outward appearance,
so that all things conform to their cultivation.
The third reveals that their motion and stillness are indistinguishable,
hence their ability to unite in emptiness.

**The First: Clarifying Those Who Can Cultivate the Dao—Wisdom and Virtue Profound and Far-Reaching.**
The origin of the great Dao is difficult to seek,
the subtle *xiàng* of its form is invisible.
Riding dragons and harnessing *qi*,
soaring through the verdant caves,
steering cranes with their wings bound,
gliding over the red mounds in ease—
its nature is still,
its form is true.
If not compared to the present age,
all ranks would strive to attain it yet fail.
To walk the Dao,
one knows the snow of three winters is deep—
suddenly arriving at the formless,
one fears the neighbors’ four directions may awaken to awareness.

Cultivation such as this—
its state is as lofty as this—
how could this be the case for one who has not yet awakened,
who lets emotions run wild,
who lives in the realm of the five desires,
and dies entering the three *tú*?
How could one recognize the heart of the ancient Sage,
who holds himself in such self-regard?

Those ancient Sages who skillfully practiced the Dao—
subtle, mysterious, and far-reaching,
deeply incomprehensible.

○ Master Yu’s Commentary: 士 is "affairs."
This speaks of the ancient ones who skillfully practiced the Dao as their affairs,
refining its subtle and profound essence—
mysterious, deep, and far-reaching—
they embodied the Dao and understood its words,
vast and unobstructed,
yet their breadth and depth were incomprehensible.

○ Lord of Héshàng said: The ancient Sages who skillfully practiced the Dao—
this refers to the rulers who employed the Dao.
Subtle, mysterious, and far-reaching—
*xiàn* is heaven.
This speaks of their resolve and conduct as subtle and mysterious,
their spirit in harmony with heaven.

Deeply incomprehensible—
the Dao’s virtue is profound and distant,
beyond recognition.
Internally gazing, like the blind;
externally listening, like the deaf.
No one knows their strengths.

○ Yán said: Above, they penetrate the meaning of the Dao and virtue;
below, they reveal the heart of the divine and enlightened.
They hold the constants of heaven and earth,
they grasp the changes of yin and yang,
yet they conceal their form and appearance,
erase all traces,
act through inversion,
and remain beyond recognition.»

「○ Róng said: The Dao of old was difficult to practice,
and the ancient *zhìshì* (知士, "wise ones") could follow it.
The Dao is subtle and essential, mysterious and tranquil, void yet penetrating.
Its practice is also supremely delicate and minute,
unobstructed and without stagnation.
When action aligns with the Dao, it becomes unfathomable and hard to know—
cannot be spoken of, for the speaker is not the Dao;
cannot be perceived, for the perceiver strays from the true.
Thus it is said: *unrecognizable*.

○ Chéng’s commentary: The ancient *shànwéishì* (善为士者, "those who skillfully cultivated the Dao")
—*gu* (古, "ancient") is *xī* (昔, "of old"),
*shàn* (善, "skillful") is the opposite of *è* (恶, "evil").
*Wéi* (为, "cultivate") means *xiūxué* (修学, "to study and refine").
The previous chapter held ancient principles to govern the present,
while this chapter governs the present by invoking the ancient,
thus presenting the *xī* (昔, "of old") *shàn xiūdào zhī shì* (善修道之士, "wise ones who refined the Dao")
as a model for those who seek to learn.
Subtle and mysterious, yet profound beyond recognition—
*wéimiào* (微妙, "subtle and essential") is the wisdom to cultivate,
*xiāntōng* (玄通, "mysterious and penetrating") is the realm to be refined.
Realm and wisdom converge,
and both cultivator and object are deep—
it cannot be grasped by the mind,
thus it is praised as *unrecognizable*.

Secondly, they manifest outward form
to guide others in their cultivation.
For only the *unrecognizable* can thus guide:
*Yuè’s commentary*: Since the Dao’s virtue is hard to recognize,
they manifest outward form to reveal it—
referring to the following passage.

*Yuè’s commentary*: Form (容, *róng*) is appearance (相貌, *xiàngmào*).
The Dao is hard to contemplate,
its practice hard to perceive—
lest those who come later lack the preparation to grasp the Dao,
or learners fail to establish proper conduct,
the following passage briefly outlines outward form
to encourage and exhort them.

*Chéng’s commentary*: Form (容, *róng*) is outward appearance (形貌, *xíngmào*).
This *unrecognizable* wisdom of the sages
is most worthy of guiding others.
Now seeking to draw in all ranks of practitioners,
they thus manifest outward form
even in the Dao’s formless principle.

Like one crossing a winter river—
*Yuè’s commentary*: *Yù* (豫, "prepared") means *xián yù* (闲豫, "leisurely ease").
The *shànshì* (善士, "wise ones") of old, hearing the Dao in their times,
were like crossing a winter river—
the masses cling to desires,
thus they feared and hesitated.
Now I am untainted,
so I am at ease.

*Yuè’s commentary*: *Yù* (豫, "prepared") means *yóuyù* (犹豫, "hesitation"), hesitation born of fear.
It speaks of those who study the Dao,
fearing the entanglements of worldly affairs and desires,
as one crossing a winter river—
the heart trembles with dread,
fearing to sink or drown.
This reveals the purity of their intentions.

Like one fearing the neighbors—
*Yuè’s commentary*: *Yóu* (犹, "like") is hesitation (疑难, *yí nán*),
*wèi* (畏, "fear") is dread.
Now I am untainted—
as mentioned above, the *shànshì* (善士) do not cling to desires,
yet when observing their conduct,
each movement and action is met with suspicion,
like a man fearing his neighbors’ awareness.
As those of old,
when facing affairs, they dreaded the scrutiny of their neighbors,
thus they were cautious and restrained.

*Yuè’s commentary*: To dwell in the world yet act wickedly,
one fears neighbors and kinsmen may awaken to their deeds.
To follow the Dao and do good,
one fears the *yōumíng* (幽明, "hidden and manifest")
may censure their shortcomings.
This reveals the purity of their speech.

Like a guest in solemnity,
like ice about to melt—
*Yuè’s commentary*: Though they appear solemn as guests,
with no artificial deeds,
they do not cling to things—
dissolving like spring ice, scattering away.

*Yuè’s commentary*: The *shànshì* (善士) do no harm to desires,
like guests facing their hosts—
solemn and respectful.
Though they face desires as guests do their hosts,
their virtuous conduct does not cling to things—
dissolving like spring ice,
unimpeded and free.

*Yuè’s commentary*: Like a guest in solemnity,
one must act only when necessary—
cultivation of the Dao should not be reckless.
Like ice about to turn to water,
when spring’s warmth arrives, the ice melts,
and the mysterious wind arises, dissolving all burdens.

*Chéng’s commentary*: Like a guest in solemnity—
*yǎn* (俨, "solemn"), the bearing of dignity.
The *Jì* (记) says: *"Yǎn ruò sī"* (俨若思, "solemn as in contemplation"),
meaning those who study must restrain and discipline their body and mind,
not indulging in recklessness,
like a guest facing their host—
they must not be frivolous.
This reveals the purity of their bodily conduct.

*Xián* (涣, "dissolving") means to disperse and release.
As in the earlier passage on cultivation—
when wisdom brightens deeply,
it may dissolve like ice in spring warmth.」

「**Thick and unadorned, like the plainness of wood**—
*Yu’s Annotation*: Though dissolved like melting ice,
never boasting of itself,
yet it remains thick and sincere,
unmarked by distinctions.

*Yu’s Commentary*: **Thick** (敦) means sincere and thick-set;
**plain** (朴) means unadorned and natural.
Though it does not cling to things,
yet it utterly rejects superficiality,
its virtue and conduct sincere and thick,
plain as wood without distinctions.

*He Shànggōng* says: **Thick** means sincere and substantial;
**plain** means form yet undivided,
innerly guarding the spirit,
outerly without ornament.

*Róng* says: Thick yet not thin,
substantial yet not ostentatious.

*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Thick** (敦) means pure and sincere;
**plain** (朴) means innate nature.
Since the threefold conduct* has already been purified,
and entanglements dispersed,
its virtue and conduct are pure and harmonious,
discarding ornament for substance.

*Vast, like an empty valley*—
*Yu’s Annotation*: Its virtue vast and spacious,
all-embracing without exclusion,
like that empty valley.

*Yu’s Commentary*: **Vast** (旷) means expansive.
The virtuous one, embracing the Dao and nurturing virtue,
possesses a vast and magnanimous scope,
capable of receiving all things,
like that hollow valley,
all-embracing without limit.

*He Shànggōng* says: **Vast** means spacious and grand;
**valley** means hollow and void,
without seeking fame in virtue,
its function all-embracing.

*Róng* says: The valley’s hollowness
holds things while echoing sounds.
The heart’s hollowness
embraces the Dao while aiding the world.

*Chéng’s Commentary*: When dusty burdens are exhausted,
the heart’s purity is clear and white,
thus its Dao and virtue vast and spacious,
all-embracing like the valley.

**Mixed, like turbid water**—
*Yu’s Annotation*: Blending light with harmony,
advancing undifferentiated,
like turbid water that clears.

*Yu’s Commentary*: The virtuous one’s heart reflects pure stillness,
yet it can contain all things,
blending light with dust,
unmarked by distinction,
mixed like turbid water—
none can perceive it.

*He Shànggōng* says: **Mixed** means guarding the true essence;
**turbid** means not reflecting.
Yet it aligns with the crowd,
never self-exalting.

*Róng* says: The heart without distinction is **mixed**;
alignment with the world is **turbid**.
Holding jade without stain,
grasping pearls while self-luminous—
this appears turbid.

*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Mixed** (混) means blending with diversity;
**turbid** (浊) means conditioned action.
Though the heart is pure and undefiled,
obstacles and entanglements dispersed,
yet within the undifferentiated chaos,
it does not differ from dust and turbidity.

Thirdly, it shows motion and stillness as unchanging,
thus able to gather in emptiness.

Who can quiet the turbid,
gradually making it clear?

*Yu’s Annotation*: **Who** (孰), meaning *who*?
Who can, in that mixed turbidity,
use stillness to settle and halt it,
so that it may gradually clear?

*Yu’s Commentary*: Following the earlier passage on turbid water,
it raises the analogy of water’s settling to clarity,
to illustrate the virtuous one’s heart—
without stain, it naturally stills.
Thus it says: Who can, in the midst of worldly loves and desires,
that turbid and mixed,
use the pure stillness of Dao-nature to settle them,
so that loves and desires do not arise?
Or, like water’s turbidity settling,
gradually becoming clear.
**Who**, meaning *who*?

*He Shànggōng* says: **Who**, meaning *who*?
Who can remain still for long,
gradually enduring to live on?

*Róng* says: **Still** (安) means tranquil;
**gradually** (徐) means slow progression.
For when motion ceases in the heart,
the spirit naturally stills;
when no disturbance touches the water,
its turbidity naturally clears.
Few practice this way,
hence it asks: *Who can*?

*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Gradually** (徐) means slow and unhurried.
Though in the midst of desires,
aligned with worldly affairs yet unstained,
the heart remains ever tranquil,
leisurely and pure.
Earlier, though clear, it could blend with turbidity;
here, though in turbidity, it does not abandon pure stillness,
revealing motion within stillness.

Who can remain still for long,
and let motion arise gradually?

*Yu’s Annotation*: **Who** can remain tranquil in clarity for long,
yet seek superior methods,
stirring practice to motion,
so that the nature of pure stillness
does not stagnate in the method,
but gradually emerges in motion?
**Motion** (动) is also **emerging** (出).

*Yu’s Commentary*: This teaches **non-stagnation in method**.
Who can, with the nature of pure stillness,
settle loves and desires,
as water’s nature—
once it has settled and cleared,
then remain tranquil in that clarity,
yet linger too long?
Lingering is not enlightenment,
not yet named as emerging.
One must always seek superior methods,
stirring practice to deepen.
Thus it says: Who can remain tranquil in clarity for long,
and let motion arise gradually?
**Motion** (生) is also **emerging** (出).

*He Shànggōng* says: **Who**, meaning *who*?
Who can remain tranquil for long,
gradually enduring to live on?

*Róng* says: **Still** (安) means tranquil;
**gradually** (徐) means slow progression.
For when motion ceases in the heart,
the spirit naturally stills;
when no disturbance touches the water,
its turbidity naturally clears.
Few practice this way,
hence it asks: *Who can*?

*Chéng’s Commentary*: Though tranquil, it is stillness within motion;
though responding to motion, the heart remains ever leisurely,
giving birth to all transformed essences.
This reveals stillness within motion.

Those who preserve this Dao
do not desire fullness.

*Yu’s Annotation*: To preserve this gradually clearing, gradually emerging Dao,
one must not cling to anything;
if one clings to clarity while seeking life,
that is called fullness—
one will lose this Dao.
Thus it says: *do not desire fullness*.

*Yu’s Commentary*: Lingering in method while seeking clarity—
this is called fullness.
Thus it says: If one wishes to preserve this Dao of gradual clarity and emergence,
one must not cling to anything,
attaining without attachment,
yet if one lingers in clarity while seeking life,
that is called fullness.
Fullness obstructs the Dao,
hence it says: *do not desire fullness*.

*He Shànggōng* says: To preserve this Dao of gradual emergence,
one must not indulge in excess or extravagance,
nor overflow with fullness.

*Róng* says: The preceding passages expound the Dao’s conduct
to encourage those who study.
When one guards it,
one naturally attains clarity,
its meaning lies in humility and retreat,
not seeking fullness.

*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Preserve** (保) means hold fast;
**fullness** (盈) means excess.
It says: Those who hold this Dao of motion and stillness as undivided
must not dwell in the middle while full.
This is to **discard the middle** (遣中).»

---
*Threefold conduct (三业): body, speech, and mind.*

**The Threefold Conduct (三业): body, speech, and mind.**

---

Now the translation:

「Indeed, only by not being full can one attain **defilement** (弊, *bì*—here meaning "humility/lowliness") and avoid **novelty** (新成, *xīnchéng*—here meaning "artificial perfection").
*Yù’s Annotation*: Only those who do not cling to fullness can thus attain **defilement** (弊) through **novelty** (新证, *xīnzhèng*). Their conduct is humble and lowly, not lingering in the attainment of **novelty** (新成).
*Yù’s Commentary*: Those who can remain unfettered by attachments, reaching **non-action** (无为), and dwelling nowhere in **dharma** (法), can use the **novelty** (新证) of the **dharma** (法) to cultivate **defilement** (敝薄), yet still seek greater refinement, not clinging to **novelty** (新成) as if it were their final state.
*He Shànggōng* says: Indeed, only those who do not cling to fullness can guard **defilement** (敝) and not seek **novelty** (新成). Those who guard **defilement** (敝) conceal **light and honor** (光荣).
**Novelty** (新成) is the pursuit of **glory and renown** (功名).
*Róng* says: In establishing one’s self, one must not reach fullness. In **rectifying and aiding** (匡辅), one must uphold **loyalty and rectitude** (忠正). Though aged, one returns to youth; though in **defilement** (敝), one renews. Those who study the Dao must **empty their hearts** (虚心) and abandon **sensual pleasures** (声色), while **washing away their worries** (澡虑) and **cleansing their disputes** (荡於纷争).
*Chéng’s Commentary*: Only the **sage of discarding the middle** (遣中圣人) can, within the realm of **action** (有为) and **defilement** (敝浊), still **compassionately rescue** (慈救) the **masses** (苍生) and achieve **great virtue and merit** (大功德). This is the **double attainment** (重结成).

---

**Chapter Sixteen: The Attainment of the Supreme Void (致虚极章)**
This chapter follows the previous one, which elucidates the **meeting of perception and wisdom** (境智相会), thereby enabling the **marvelous attainment of the Supreme Mysterious** (妙极重玄). Thus, this chapter is placed next.
It reveals the **fruit of the Supreme Mysterious Dao** (重玄道果). In this chapter, the meaning is divided into three aspects:
1. **Briefly marking the Dao’s fruit** (略标道果) to encourage beings to begin cultivation.
2. **Exhorting a return to the origin and source** (劝返本还源), merging with the **root** (根) and **reclaiming the vital breath** (复命).
3. **Illustrating the progression from small to great** (示从小入大), **wondrously aligning with the Supreme Void** (妙契虚玄).

1. **Briefly marking the Dao’s fruit** (略标道果) to encourage beings to begin cultivation.
The **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **true essence** (真宗). Those who **quietly forget** (恬忘) its **vital principle** (要者) enter the **abode of the Rare and Strange** (希夷之奥), dwelling in the **dim and vague** (惚恍之先). Their **principle transcends all non-conformity** (理绝百非).
They may **recite the Four Sentences** (言忘四句) or **wander in the upper realms** (游上界), sitting upon **Péngyǔ** (蓬岳) and **concentrating their spirit** (凝神). At times, they descend to the **lower mundane** (下凡), holding a **boat’s oar** (舟航) to **assist beings** (接物).
They open the **vast expanse of the Dao’s realm** (大囿之境), and the **heavens and earth embrace it without limit** (天地纳之而不穷). They dwell in the **subtle and minute** (细微之中), yet even the **finest hairs and tips of grass** (毫末) cannot be sought to find them.
Their **principle is clear and free from strife** (厥理清争), and their **non-thinking is without announcement** (其不思告). Those who **quietly retreat** (静退) must **approach the Supreme Void** (臻虚极之道).

**The Attainment of the Supreme Void** (致虚极) is **to steadfastly guard stillness** (守静笃).
*Yù’s Annotation*: The **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **wondrous origin** (妙本). It is said that all beings, upon taking birth, **inherit the Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (禀虚极妙本). Once they receive form and **begin to take and hold** (受纳), then the **wondrous origin disperses** (妙本离散).
Now, if one wishes the **Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (虚极妙本) to **necessarily manifest in the body** (致於身), one must **abandon dusty perceptions and attachments** (弃尘境染滞) and **steadfastly guard the female-stillness** (守此雌静笃厚). Then the **Supreme Void’s Dao** (虚极之道) will naturally **govern the body** (政於身).
*Yù’s Commentary*: The **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **wondrous origin** (妙本). It is said that all beings, upon taking birth, **inherit the Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (禀虚极妙本), which is their **original nature** (正性). Once they receive form, the **six senses cling to pleasure** (六根爱悦), and the **five desires vie in competition** (五欲奔竞), then the **original nature disperses** (正性离散), and they **lose the wondrous origin** (失妙本).
Now, if one wishes the **Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (虚极妙本) to **manifest and govern the body** (爻自政於身), one must **steadfastly guard the female-stillness** (守此雌静), **cultivate a profound and thick nature and disposition** (笃厚性情), and **sever desires** (绝欲). Without **narrowing** (狭) yet **not wearying**, the **Supreme Void’s wondrous origin** (虚极妙本) will naturally **manifest and govern the body** (自政於身).
This is like **water flowing to dampness** (流湿) and **fire tending to dryness** (就燥).
**Attainment** (致) means to **invite it to manifest** (令爻自来), as in the **classical meaning of "attaining a teacher"** (如春秋致师之义).
*He Shànggōng* says: **The Attainment of the Supreme Void** (致虚极) is when the **cultivator abandons emotions and desires** (修道之人捐情去欲), **cleansing the five viscera** (五内清净), and **attaining the Supreme Void** (致於虚极).
**To steadfastly guard stillness** (守静笃) is to **guard purity** (守清净) and **practice profound virtue** (行笃厚).
*Róng* says: If their **nature is upright and pure** (性正而贞), and their **conduct is clear and distant** (行清而远), those who **guard it with profundity** (守之厚者) may attain the **Supreme Void’s Dao** (虚极之道).
*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Attainment** (致) means **to obtain** (得也). The **Supreme Void** (虚极) is the **fruit of the Dao** (道果). **Profound** (笃) means **central** (中也). It is said: If one wishes to obtain the **fruit of the wondrous and supremely void** (虚玄极妙之果), one must **quiet the heart and guard the central Dao** (静心守一中之道), then it may be obtained.

2. **Exhorting a return to the origin and source** (劝返本还源), merging with the **root** (根) and **reclaiming the vital breath** (复命).
All things arise together; I observe their **return** (复).
*Yù’s Annotation*: The **Laozi** (老君) says: How do we know that **guarding female-stillness** (守雌静) can **attain the Supreme Void** (致虚极)? We observe all things in **motion and action** (动作). Once we observe their **return** (归复), it is always in **stillness** (静), hence it is so.
*Yù’s Commentary*: This clarifies that **steadfastly guarding stillness** (守静笃) **necessarily attains the Supreme Void** (必致虚极). All things and all forms, though their **motions and actions differ** (动作不同), once observed in their **return** (归复), always abide in their **origin** (本). The *Yìjīng* says: *"Thunder within the earth—this is **Return** (复)."* **Return** (复) means **to revert to the origin** (反本之谓也). Hence, **stillness returns** (静则归复), while **motion loses the origin** (动则失本).
*He Shànggōng* says: All things arise together—**arise** (作) means **birth** (生也). All things are born together; I observe their **return** (复), meaning I observe all things, and they **all revert to their origin** (皆归其本). Thus, one should **contemplate their origin** (念其本).
*Yán* says: It begins with **non-action** (无为), moves with **formlessness** (无形), **emerges in harmony with the seasons** (发於时和), thereby **fulfilling great success** (遂成功).
*Róng* says: All things arise together—ordinary people cannot **guard non-action to maintain stillness** (守无为以安静), and for **emotions** (情) they **move and act** (动作), abandoning **truth** (真) to follow **deceit** (伪), losing their **origin** (本) and **pursuing the trivial** (逐末).
I observe their **return** (复)—**return** (复) means **origin** (本). Ordinary people **lose their origin and pursue the trivial** (失本而逐末), **abandoning purity to enter impurity** (离淳以入浇). The **sage suppresses the trivial and honors the origin** (圣人抑末而崇本), **returning impurity to restore simplicity** (返浇以还朴).
*Chéng’s Commentary*: **Arise** (作) means **to move and act** (动用也). It is said that all beings, in their **arising and acting** (并皆云为), **covetously grasp at external phenomena** (贪逐前境). Yet with the **Laozi’s holy wisdom** (老君圣智) observing them, all **revert to the wondrous origin** (复在妙本), whether in motion or stillness.

The myriad things, though **flourishing and diverse** (芸芸), **each return to their root** (各复归其根).
*Yù’s Annotation*: Again, it is said: How do we know that all things **return to stillness** (归复), always abiding in **stillness** (静)? Because all things, in their **flourishing and diverse** (花叶芸芸), **naturally revert to their roots** (生性皆复归於其根). Hence, though they **arise in flourishing diversity** (有作芸芸), their **motions and actions** (动作) all return to their **roots and origins** (根本).
*Yù’s Commentary*: This illustrates the **meaning of observing their return** (观复之意). The **root** (根) is where the **origin receives qi** (本所受气) and **gives rise to form** (而生也).

Now observing the myriad things, their **flourishing and diverse** (花叶芸芸) forms and their **inherent natures** (生性) all **return to their roots** (复归於其根) and **renew anew** (而更生). The **void’s utmost subtlety** (虚极) and **wondrous origin** (妙本) are what humans **receive and from which they are born** (人所禀而生也). Now observing **emotions and desires** (情欲) **abundant and restless** (熙熙), if one **preserves stillness** (守静) and **attains emptiness** (致虚), then their **true nature returns** (正性归复) to the **original essence** (命元) and they may **endure long** (而长久矣).

---
**Yóng’s Commentary**: Things are also like humans, and **roots** (根) are also **origins** (本). It is said that humans, with a **single mind**, grasp at the **verdant myriad realms** (攀绿万境), and their affairs are **not singular** (其事非一), hence **flourishing and diverse** (芸芸). The **Sages all exhort to return to the origin** (圣人皆劝以反本), hence it is said that each **returns to its root** (各归其根).

**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **Flourishing and diverse** (芸芸) describes **multitude** (众多貌也). It is said that the reason living beings **cannot align with the Sage’s heart** (不能同於圣心), though they move or rest (虽动不动), and act without intention (用而无心), is because their **restless striving never ceases** (只为芸芸驰竞不息也). If one **returns to the origin and roots** (能反本归根), they will **align with the Sage’s illumination** (即同於圣照)—this is the exhortation. **Returning to the root** (归根) is **stillness** (曰静), and **stillness** (静) is **restoring the original essence** (日复命).

**Yù’s Annotation**: Those whose **forms flourish and diversify** (花叶芸芸) have **natures that return to their roots** (生性归根), thus they **become still** (则静止矣). When humans **return to the root and attain utmost stillness** (能归根至静), it may be said they **restore what they originally received** (可谓复所禀之性命也).

**Yù’s Exegesis**: Things **returning to their roots** (物归根) become **tranquil** (则安静), and humans **preserving stillness** (人守静) **attain emptiness** (则致虚). Trees **receive life from their roots** (木之禀生者根), and **returning to the root** (归根) is **restoring their essence** (故复命). Humans **receive life from the wondrous origin** (人禀生者妙本); now, if they **preserve stillness and attain emptiness** (今能守静致虚), it may be said they **return to what they originally received** (可谓归复所禀之性命矣).

**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Returning to the root** (归根) is **stillness** (日静), and **stillness** (静) refers to **the root** (谓根也). The root is **tranquil, soft, and weak** (安静柔弱), **humble and lowly** (谦卑处下), hence it **cannot die** (故不能死也). **Stillness** (静) is **restoring the original essence** (日复命), meaning that **tranquility** (安静者) is **returning the essence and life** (是谓复还性命) so that they **do not die** (使不死也).

**Yán’s Commentary**: Heaven and Earth **reverse and return** (反复), hence they **endure long** (故能长久). Humans **return to repose** (复寝寐), hence they **become keen-witted** (故能聪明). Dragons and snakes **return to their coiled state** (复垫), hence they **manifest transformations** (故能彰变). Grasses and trees **return to their roots** (复本), hence they **remain verdant** (故能青青). **Returning** (复) allows the **spirit and clarity** (神明) to **find their proper place** (得位), **communing with the void** (与虚无通), the **soul rests** (魂休), the **ether rests** (魄息), each **finding its place of ease** (各得所安宁), the **qi harmonizes** (气顺), and the **blood vessels balance** (血脉和平也).

**Yóng’s Commentary**: **At the periphery**, this is why there is **cyclic rebirth** (所以轮回也). **Returning to the origin** (反本) is **serene and unmoving** (寂然不动), and **stillness** (静) is **restoring the original essence** (日复命). In **near terms**, the **forceful and violent** (强梁) **cannot meet their end** (不得其死), and this is called **dying in the midst of life** (名之中夭). **Preserving emptiness and stillness** (虚静) **safeguards one’s natural lifespan** (保其天年), which is called **restoring the original essence** (是谓复命). In **far-reaching terms**, **movement brings life and death** (动则有生有死), **losing one’s true nature** (失於其性), while **stillness brings neither death nor life** (静则不死不生), **returning to the original blessing** (复於惠命也).

**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **Returning to the root** (归根) is **stillness** (日静), but if one **returns to the origin and source** (能返本还源), the **restless striving of the heart naturally ceases** (驰竞之心自息也). **Stillness** (静) is **restoring the original essence** (日复命), for **original essence** (命) is the **true nature and blessed life** (真性惠命也). Having **set aside clamor and dust** (既屏息嚣尘), the **heart and spirit become concentrated and serene** (心神凝寂), hence they **return to their true nature** (故复於真性) and **revert to the blessed life** (反於惠命). **Restoring the original essence** (复命) is **constancy** (曰常), and **knowing constancy** (知常) is **clarity** (曰明).

**Yù’s Annotation**: **Preserving stillness and restoring the original essence** (守静复命) may be called **having constancy** (可谓有常). **Knowing constancy** (知守常者) **increases clarity** (更益明了).

**Yù’s Exegesis**: **Restoring the original essence** (复命) is **constancy** (日常). If one **steadfastly preserves the receptive stillness** (能守雌静笃厚), and **attains the void’s utmost subtlety and wondrous origin** (以致虚极妙本), then **emptiness** (虚) **restores the original essence** (则复命), and this may be called **attaining constancy** (可谓得常矣). **Knowing constancy** (知常) is **clarity** (日明); **not knowing constancy** (不知常) and **acting recklessly** (妄作) is **calamitous** (凶), which may be called **lacking steadfastness** (可谓无恒). **Not steadfast in virtue** (不恒其德) leads to **ruin and calamity** (穷凶必矣). The annotation says: **"Not steadfast in virtue"** (不恒其德), or perhaps **shame follows** (或承之羞), is from the *Yì* **Constancy (Héng) Hexagram’s text** (《易》恒卦词也).

**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Restoring the original essence** (复命) is **constancy** (日常), **restoring the original essence to prevent death** (复命使不死), which is the **Dao’s perpetual practice** (乃道之所常行). **Knowing constancy** (知常) is **clarity** (日明), for those who **know the Dao’s perpetual practice** (能知道之常行者) are **clear** (则为明也).

**Yóng’s Commentary**: **Restoring the original essence** (复命) is **constancy** (日常). There is **life and death** (有死有生), hence it is **interrupted** (故断). **Neither death nor life** (不死不生), hence **knowing constancy** (故知常) is **clarity** (日明). Those who **lose this principle** (迷斯理者) are **obscured** (暗), while those who **awaken to this Way** (悟此道者) are **clear** (明).

**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **Restoring the original essence** (复命) is **constancy** (日常), **returning to the true nature and original essence** (反於性命), **concentrated and serene** (凝然湛然), **neither life nor death** (不复生死), hence it is called **constancy** (因之日常). **Knowing constancy** (知常) is **clarity** (日明), for those who **know the principle of returning to the true, constant essence** (既知反命真常之理者) will have **wise and enlightened clarity** (则智惠明照), **illuminating even the most hidden** (无幽不烛). **Not knowing constancy** (不知常) and **acting recklessly** (妄作) is **calamitous** (凶). The annotation says: **"Not steadfast in virtue"** (不恒其德), or perhaps **shame follows** (或承之羞), for **losing constancy and acting recklessly** (失常妄作) leads to **ruin and calamity** (穷凶铃矣). The annotation says: **"Not steadfast in virtue"** (不怛其德), or perhaps **shame follows** (或承之羞), is from the *Yì* **Constancy (Héng) Hexagram’s text** (《易》恒卦辞也).

**Yù’s Exegesis**: This may be called **lacking caution** (可谓无慎). **Not steadfast in virtue** (不恒其德) leads to **ruin and calamity** (穷凶铃矣). The annotation says: **"Not steadfast in virtue"** (不怛其德), or perhaps **shame follows** (或承之羞), is from the *Yì* **Constancy (Héng) Hexagram’s text** (《易》恒卦辞也).

**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Not knowing the Dao’s perpetual practice** (不知道之所常行), **acting deceitfully and craftily** (妄作巧诈), then **losing the spirit and clarity** (则失神明), hence **calamity** (故凶也).

**Yán’s Commentary**: Those who **lose the Dao** (失道之人) **abandon constancy** (废弃经常), **pursue cleverness** (事其聪明), **indulge their desires** (纵其志欲), and **act recklessly in calamitous ways** (妄作凶行), hence **knowing brings punishment** (故知以受祸), **clarity brings misfortune** (明以造殃), **deep insight leads to death** (深察以死), and **vast knowledge brings ruin** (博辨以亡). Why is this so? Because they **do not return to the primal origin** (不反元始), **do not restore the original root** (不复本根), their **actions conflict with the Dao** (动与道乖), and their **stillness diverges from the spirit** (静与神殊). Thus, **what they seek to preserve cannot be preserved** (存故不能存也), and **what they seek to actualize cannot be actualized** (然故不能然也).

**Yóng’s Commentary**: **Knowing constancy and trusting the Dao** (知常信道), all their actions are **virtuous** (所行皆善), hence **Heaven aids and humans assist** (天佑人助), which is why it is said to be **auspicious** (吉). If all **follow the Dao’s deviations** (皆道从邪), **indulge emotions and will** (纵情任意), **encountering empty delusions and acting recklessly** (触徒妄作), their actions are **inappropriate** (所为失当), hence **humans punish and ghosts harm** (人诛鬼害), which is why it is said to be **calamitous** (凶也).

**Chéng’s Exegesis**: Those who **do not know the nature of cultivation and returning to virtue** (不知性修反德), and **do not align with the true, constant Dao** (而会於真常之道者), then **give rise to delusive thoughts** (则起妄心), **follow phenomena to create karma** (随境造业), and **move toward the path of death** (动之死地), so all their actions are **calamitous** (所作皆凶也). This is the **third demonstration**, entering from the small to the great, **wondrously resonating with the void and subtlety** (妙契虚玄).

**Yù’s Annotation**: **Knowing constancy** (知守真常) makes the **heart and circumstances empty and still** (则心境虚静), like **a secluded valley** (如彼空谷), **containing all without exclusion** (无不含容也).

**Yù’s Exegesis**: **Knowing constancy** (知常) is **clarity** (日明), and **clarity** (明) means **discerning things** (则鉴物). When things come, they **must respond** (必应), **containing all without exclusion** (无不含容), hence it is said: **knowing constancy is containing** (故日知常日容).

**Hé Shànggōng** says: Those who **know the Dao’s perpetual practice** (能知道之所常行) **eliminate emotions and desires** (则除去情欲), and **contain all without exclusion** (无所不包容).

**Yóng’s Commentary**: **Knowing constancy and penetrating the principle** (知常达理) has a **capacity equal to the void** (量等虚空), **containing all without exclusion** (无所不包), hence it is said to be **containing** (故日容也).

「**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **The body solidifies with the Dao’s eternal oneness** (体凝常一道), **awakening to the duality of compliance and deviation as void** (悟违顺两空), hence one **can contain all things** (故能容物).
**Containing is *gōng*** (容乃公).
**Yù’s Exegesis**: **To embrace and respond to all things** (含容应物), **to respond without attachment** (应物无心), **having no partiality or deceit** (既无私邪), hence it is **the essence of impartiality** (故为公正也).
**Yù’s Exegesis**: **One who can embrace and respond to all things** (能含容应物) **is impartial and without favor** (乃公正无私), **and thus all under heaven will follow** (无私则天下归往), **which is called *wáng*** (是谓王矣).

**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Without failing to contain anything** (无不包容), **one attains impartiality and lacks favor** (则公正无私), **and no malevolent force can withstand** (众邪莫当也).
**Yóng** says: **Impartial without favor** (正而无私).

**Chéng’s Exegesis**: *Gōng* means **levelness** (平也). **Since one can embrace all things** (既能包容庶物), **thus one attains impartiality and lacks favor** (所以公正无私). **Impartiality is *wáng*** (公乃王).
**Yù’s Exegesis**: **Those who are impartial and lack favor** (能公正无私者), **will be followed by all things** (则为物所归往).
**Hé Shànggōng** says: **Impartial and without favor** (公正无私), **one can rule all under heaven** (则可为天下王). **To govern oneself with rectitude** (治身正) **is to unify the form** (则形一), **and to illuminate one’s spirit** (神明千万), **all harmoniously resonating within oneself** (共奏己躬).
**Yóng** says: **Partiality cannot harmonize with things** (偏私不堪宰物), **but impartiality can preside over all** (公正可以君临也).

**Chéng’s Exegesis**: *Wáng* means **to follow** (往也). **Because one encompasses all things** (只为包含万物), **being impartial and without favor** (公正无私), **thus one becomes the Great Law King** (所以作大法王) **whom all under heaven follow** (为苍生之所归往). **The King is *Dào*** (王乃天).
**Yù’s Exegesis**: **All things joyfully submit** (群物乐推), **like Heaven’s universal coverage** (如天之覆), **thus one’s virtue aligns with Heaven** (则与天合德也).
**Yù’s Exegesis**: **The King’s virtue aligns with Heaven** (王德如天), **thus one acts without contrivance yet all things are in order** (则无为而理), **and the Dao’s transformation is set in motion** (道化乃行), hence it is said: **the King is *Dào*** (故云王乃天).

**Hé Shànggōng** says: **The King can harmonize virtue with the spirit** (王能德合神明), **thus one is in communion with Heaven** (乃与天通也).
**Yóng** says: **Universal coverage without attachment** (无心广覆), **operating in accordance with the seasons** (运行以时).

**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **Having already become the Great Law King** (既作法王), **encompassing all sentient beings** (化主), **and being followed by all things** (为物所归), **one further shelters and covers all sentient life** (复荫覆含灵), **in equality with the boundless Heaven** (同於昊昊). **Heaven is *Dào*** (天乃道).
**Yù’s Exegesis**: **The King’s virtue mirrors Heaven** (王德如天), **thus one can practice the Dao** (乃能行道).
**Yù’s Exegesis**: **The virtue of the King aligns with Heaven** (王德合天), **thus one can endure the Dao’s course** (则久享福祚), **and the people of all under heaven gather toward it like the sun** (天下之人就之如日), **revere it like Heaven** (戴之如天), **benefit from it like rain** (泽之如雨), **and anticipate it like spring** (望之如春). **Then until one’s death** (则终殁其身), **what peril or danger remains?** (复何危殆之事？) Hence it is said: **to die is not to perish** (故云殁身不殆).

**Hé Shànggōng** says: **To be in harmony with the Dao** (与道合同), **thus one can endure long** (乃能长久).
**Yóng** says: **The Dao endures eternally from antiquity** (道则自古以固存), **and the Sage enjoys boundless, timeless life** (圣则永享无期寿也).

**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **The measure equals the Great Emptiness** (量等太虚), **with neither coming nor going** (无来无去). **The heart merges with the Supreme Dao** (心冥至道), **neither annihilated nor born** (不灭不生). **Since this aligns with the above** (既与此相符), **hence it is said to be enduring** (故义说为久). **To die is not to perish** (殁身不殆).
**Yù’s Exegesis**: **To act in accordance with Heaven’s Dao** (同天行道), **then even at one’s final moment** (则终殁其身), **there is no peril or danger** (长无危殆之事矣).

**Hé Shànggōng** says: **One who can be impartial and a King** (能公能王), **united with Heaven and the Dao** (通天合道), **refined in purity and vast in virtue** (四者纯俗), **with Dao and virtue ever expansive** (道德弘远), **suffers no calamity or blame** (无殃无咎), **and perishes with Heaven and Earth** (与天地俱没), **yet remains unthreatened** (而不危殆也).

**Yóng** says: **To perish is to reach one’s end** (没，终也). **To align with Heaven is to endure** (与天为期), **and to harmonize with the Dao is to last** (与道同久), **thus one’s finality is within this very body** (终於此身), **forever free from peril or danger** (永无危殆).

**Chéng’s Exegesis**: **To perish means to vanish without trace** (没，灭也). **To not perish means to be without danger** (殆，危也). **To hide one’s essence and erase one’s form** (匿端灭迹) **is called to perish within the body** (谓之没身). **To respond to sensations and act in accordance with circumstances** (应感赴机) **is called to not perish** (谓之不殆).
**Alternative Explanation**: **The form has rise and fall** (迹有兴废), hence it is said **to perish within the body** (故言没身). **The essence is without birth or death** (本无生灭), hence it is said **to not perish** (故言不殆).

**Chapter Seventeen: *Dàoshàng Xià Zhī* (The Supreme Sovereign Knows Only That There Is Something Above)**

**The Supreme Sovereign’s chapter follows the previous one**, for the prior chapter expounds the **Ultimate Mystery of the Dao’s profound essence**, urging all beings to begin cultivation. Thus, this chapter is placed next, revealing **the responses and transformations that follow in due course**, descending from the **root to its outward manifestations**.

Within this chapter, two distinctions are made:
1. **The disparity in innate nature and varying levels of enlightenment**.
2. **The sigh over the hidden operation of the Supreme Virtue**, where wisdom is yet ignorance.

**1. The disparity in innate nature and varying levels of enlightenment**
The **Sovereign of Lu** (栗陆) and **Hèxiū** (赫胥) ruled as sovereigns in their respective ages, yet both adhered to the **Supreme Dao**, not engaging in artificial governance. Their reigns brought **peace to the Twelve Emperors**, and their glory endured for **tens of thousands of years**. The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) ruled without action or contrivance, neither above nor below knowing anything, and not entangled in affairs. The people lived like wild deer, the sovereign like a **marking branch** (标枝)—a natural symbol of leadership. The land became a **realm of the Great Dao**, and all things flourished in the **field of Huàxiū** (华胥). The **true qi** was thick and profound, their nourishment pure and harmonious; they followed the **natural inclinations of the Dao**, embodying the **uncarved simplicity of Tàipǔ** (太朴). Their lives were long, their hearts sincere—**how was this achieved?** It was truly **reliant upon the power of non-action**.

The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is known only as something above (下知有之).

**Explanation of the passage:**
It refers to **knowing the Supreme Sovereign above (the *dàoshàng* of the *nìhuán* 泥丸) and the lower *dàotiān* (丹田)**, where the union of *yīn* and *yáng* occurs in the *jiàngguān* (绛官). By closing the heart and grasping the essence, the **original qi** flows, and the ears perceive the **divine sounds**. When one knows the **lower abdomen’s resonance** (腹呜) and governs it with **single-mindedness**, the sounds of **bells and drums** emerge.

**Imperial Commentary by the Tang Xuānzōng:**
The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the **primordial ruler of antiquity**. *Xiàzhī* (下知) means that the subjects **know there is a ruler above**, revering it as the heavens, yet **without any trace of artificial governance or contrivance**, so the people **lack virtue yet still proclaim it**.

**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**
The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the **primordial ruler of antiquity**. It is called "Supreme" because it is **held in highest reverence**. The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) rules through **non-action**, teaching without words. The subjects merely know that there is a ruler above, revering it as the heavens. The **Supreme Sovereign** is great and above all, **bearing the beauty of the four seasons’ nurturing**, yet the subjects **do not know how to ascribe virtue to it**, hence it is said, **"only that there is something above"** (下知有之).

**Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said:
The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) refers to the **nameless ruler of the Great Antiquity**. *Xiàzhī* (下知有之) means the subjects **know there is a ruler above yet do not serve it**, for their affairs are **simple, unadorned, and pure**.

**Lǐ Yóng** (李荣) said:
The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the ruler of **Supreme Virtue**. Since virtue is **ineffable** and its name is **hard to define**, it is only said that the **Great Person** (大人) is above. The passage **alludes to the Supreme Sovereign**, who **embraces the Dao and Virtue**, yet **requires nothing from below**. Below is **self-sufficient**, above **receives no tribute**. Between the sovereign and subjects, above and below, **there is only the knowing that there is something**.

**Exegesis by Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英):
The **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) is the **Great Dao’s Teacher of All Beings**. The **Dao’s Sovereign** abides **above the Jade Capital** (玉京) and **within the Golden Gate** (金阙), where the mind **concentrates and drifts in boundless contemplation**, dwelling in the **eternal response**. Those with **keen innate roots**, whose **enlightenment is bright and profound**, deeply grasp the **mystery of the essence**, and their minds **concentrate yet are boundless and tranquil**. Their bodies transcend **form and name**, descending from the **root and manifesting outwardly**—thus they have a **title**, yet **do not cling to appearances**. Hence it is said, **"only that there is something above"** (下知有之), meaning they **know the origin of the name "Supreme Sovereign"**.

Next, **the sovereign is beloved and praised**.
**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**
When the **Supreme Sovereign** (太上) passes away, the **Yellow Emperor**, **Yáo**, and **Shùn** emerge, **applying teachings and performing benevolence**, extending their **virtue to the common people**. Thus they are **beloved**. Their **gentle governance brings harmony**, and their **achievements surpass the world**—thus they are **praised**. This **love and praise arise from the people’s traces**, yet **such artificial governance becomes a calamity for future generations**, hence *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) says: **"I tell you! The root of great chaos lies between the ages of Yáo and Shùn. Its end persists even a thousand generations later."**

**Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said:
Their **virtue is visible**, their **benevolence and grace can be praised**—thus they are **beloved and praised**.

**Yán Jūn Píng** (严君平) said:
When people **delight in being sovereigns**, they are called **Emperors**.

**Explanation by the *Jiéshuō* (节解):**
**Beloved** refers to the **spirit** (魂), **praised** refers to the **shadow** (魄).

**Lǐ Yóng** (李荣) said:
The **ruler of lower virtue** (下德之君) **engages in contrived governance**, yet **cannot forget words**. Above, the sovereign is **trusted and revered by the subjects**; below, the sovereign is **praised by those above**.

**Exegesis by Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英):
Those of **medium innate roots**, whose **enlightenment is somewhat dim**, **cannot forget words to verify truth**, and must **grasp forms to cultivate**. Thus they **cling to scriptures and teachings**, **cherishing and praising** the sovereign in **artificial reverence**, generating **emotions through texts**, and **mutually flattering** one another.

Next, **the sovereign is feared and scorned**.
**Imperial Commentary by the Tang Xuānzōng:**
When **virtue declines further**, the sovereign **imposes many faults in governance**, and the people **cannot endure his rule**. Then the sovereign **drives them with punishments**, hence they **fear him**. When **emotions are indulged and deceit prevails**, the sovereign **cannot discern truth**, hence they **scorn him**.

**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**
When the **Yellow Emperor**, **Yáo**, and **Shùn** pass away, descending to the **Three Kings and Five Hegemons**, their governance **grows increasingly oppressive**, with **harsh laws and severe punishments**—thus they are **feared**. Their **inability to discern truth** leads to **scorn**. Below, they **accuse the guilty to seek merit**; above, they **reward the wicked to foster deceit**. Thus mutual deception arises, **causing hearts to grow cold**.

**Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said:
Next, **they fear him**, establishing **laws and punishments to govern them**. **They scorn him**, for his **many prohibitions and burdensome decrees** cannot **inspire sincere allegiance**, hence they **deceive and scorn him**.

**Yán Jūn Píng** (严君平) said:
**Sighing and lamenting**, he is called **ruler** (王).

**Lǐ Yóng** (李荣) said:
Unable to **follow the transformations of all things** or **trust in nature’s spontaneity**, they **establish laws and punishments to threaten them**—thus it is said, **"feared"**. With **many decrees and the people deceiving below**—thus it is said, **"scorned"**. This is the **degeneration of the ancient order**.

**Exegesis by Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英):
**Scorn** is **deceit**. Those of **low innate roots**, whose **nature is dull and emotions unbridled**, **indulge their hearts in sensory pursuits**, growing **ever more entangled**. They **fear only worldly punishments**, not the **retribution of the netherworld**, hence they **deceive and scorn the sacred words**, **defaming and rejecting them**. Thus the *Dàodé Jīng* (道德经) says: **"The petty scholar hears the Dao and laughs at it."**

**Imperial Commentary by the Tang Xuānzōng:**
Those who **fear and scorn the sovereign** arise **from the sovereign’s lack of trustworthiness**, hence the people below **also have those who do not believe**.

**Imperial Exegesis by the Tang Xuānzōng:**
This **reverses the explanation of "fear and scorn"** (畏之侮之).

「The common folk fear the sovereign’s teachings and decrees, all because the sovereign’s trustworthiness is insufficient among them, hence the people below also come to have such unfaithful ones.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: *"Insufficient trustworthiness"* means the sovereign lacks trustworthiness among the people below, so the people below then have clever and deceitful subjects. *"There are those who do not believe"* means the people below respond with disbelief and deceive their sovereign.

○ **Róng** (荣) said: As the ruler above, one should **transform** (化) them with the **Dao/Way**; one should **demonstrate** (示) trustworthiness. If the ruler can trust the people below, the people below will also trust the ruler. If the ruler can trust the people below, the people below will also trust the ruler above.

○ **Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英): Precisely because the people below are burdened by **innate roots** (机) and **trustworthy roots** (信根) are insufficient, they doubt and defame the sacred texts, incurring the crime of disbelief. Hence, the **Dao/Way** is held in contempt.

○ **Imperial Commentary** (御注): *"To honor and praise"* (亲之誉之) refers to the sovereign having words of **virtue/power** (德) and teaching (教), hence the people honor and praise his words.

○ **Imperial Exegesis** (御疏): This **reverses the explanation** of *"to honor and praise"* (亲之誉之也). The common folk thus honor and love the sovereign’s benevolence and goodness, and praise the sovereign’s accomplishments and deeds, because the sovereign has words of **virtue/power** (德教) and teaching (教), hence they hold his words in high regard and praise them.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: When the **Sovereign of the Highest** (太上之君) undertakes actions, they are still held in high regard as words. This is to **fear departing from the Dao/Way** and losing **naturalness** (自然).

○ **Róng** (荣) said: This refers to the time of antiquity (中古之时), when one had not yet forgotten words (未能忘言). Words were borrowed to convey meaning, and mutual honor and praise were given. Hence, words were emphasized.

○ **Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英): The false and superficial words of the worldly (世俗浮伪之言) are why they do not know the **true and real teachings** (至道真实之教) of the **Dao/Way**. Thus, confusion and delusion grow deeper with time, and their **karmic obstacles** (罪障) increase.

**Second sigh:** The **highest virtue/power** (至德) is hidden and unmanifest, yet the people remain unaware in their daily lives. When accomplishments are fulfilled and undertakings completed, the common folk say, *"The Sovereign of the Highest acts naturally."*

○ **Imperial Commentary** (御注): When accomplishments are fulfilled yet the ruler does not cling to them, and undertakings are completed yet the ruler takes no action, the common folk live their daily lives unaware, saying, *"The Sovereign of the Highest naturally achieves and fulfills this."* Then, the **Sovereign of the Highest** remains unknown below.

○ **Imperial Exegesis** (御疏): This **reverses the explanation** of *"the Sovereign of the Highest remains unknown below"* (太上下知也). If the **Dao/Way** is pure and uncorrupted (淳朴不残), who would make the **sacrificial offerings** (牺樽)? If the **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (道德) are universally practiced (公行), why would there be any need for honor and praise (亲誉焉设)? Hence, in the age of the **Sovereign of the Highest**, the people below forget the **imperial force** (帝力), and only when accomplishments are fulfilled and undertakings completed do the common folk regard it as natural and fitting, unaware of why they honor and praise benevolence and kindness.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: *"Accomplishments fulfilled and undertakings completed"* refers to the **Great Peace** (太平) of the world. *"The common folk say, 'The Sovereign of the Highest acts naturally'"*—the common folk do not know that the sovereign above possesses **pure and profound virtue/power** (德淳厚), instead believing it is their own natural course.

○ **Róng** (荣) said: The **imperial Dao/Way** (帝皇之道) is to **achieve great accomplishments** (隆功成). The **wind of non-action** (无为之风) is to **complete undertakings** (着事遂). Earlier, the three ancient stages were explained: the **Dao/Way** was lost, and **virtue/power** declined, from **pure antiquity** (淳) to **corrupted later times** (浇), then again returning to **pure antiquity** (淳). The **Dao/Way** is shallow and easily seen, while **virtue/power** is high and difficult to perceive. Now that the **sacred transformation** (圣化) is profound and the **divine accomplishments** (神功) are unfathomable, the people remain unaware in their daily lives, saying it is natural. Hence, *"the Sovereign of the Highest remains unknown below."*

○ **Chéng Xuānyīng** (成玄英): The **accomplishments of the Dao/Way** (亭毒之功成) and the **fulfillment of nurturing life** (生育之事遂) are such that the **highest virtue/power** (至德) remains hidden, yet the ruler does not claim credit for the success. Thus, the common folk live their daily lives unaware, saying, *"The Sovereign of the Highest naturally attains such things,"* without knowing they should **rely upon the sacred grace** (荷圣恩).

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao/Way is Abandoned**

This chapter follows the previous one, which explained how **Dao/Way** manifests from its **original root** (本) and descends into **traces** (迹), adapting to circumstances (随机). Hence, this chapter follows to clarify that once the **traces** (迹) are established, the **mysterious root** (妙本) is concealed.

Within this chapter, there are three layers of meaning:
1. It explains that when the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) does not prevail, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) then appear.
2. It explains that using **wisdom** (智) to govern things is the **source of artifice and deceit** (娇诈之源).
3. It distinguishes how **loyalty and filial piety** (忠孝) arise due to **disorder** (为乱).

**First layer:** When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) does not prevail, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) then appear.

The **Five Emperors** (五帝) were pure and flowing (淳流), while the **Three Kings** (三王) were **corrupted and competitive** (浇竞). Because the **Dao/Way of knotted cords** (结绳道) was abandoned and **martial affairs** (干戈事) arose, **Yīn** (殷) then practiced **sacrificial offerings** with **sliced hearts** (赤血剖心), and **Zhōu** (周) used **white flags** (白旗) to **display severed heads** (枭首). When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) is abandoned, the world falls into disorder (崩离). **Wú and Yuè** (吴越) perished through **conquest and slaughter** (伐国亡躯), while **Zhī Chéng** (之呛) lost his life through **surrendering power** (禅权绝命). The meaning of losing the **Dao/Way** is evident here.

Thus, it is known that the **sacred governance** (圣治) has no **action** (为), and the **mysterious wind** (玄风) of the **Dao/Way** (道) is ever-present (长扇). Even **straw dogs** (刍狗) and all things are not **cherished as one’s own** (不亲其亲), yet the ruler **accepts offerings from the common folk** (纳惶) in fear, and **comforts the suffering masses** (吊百姓之涂炭). They speak of *"joy"* (乐) and *"joy"* (乐), yet why do they use **bells and drums** (锺鼓)? They speak of *"rites"* (礼) and *"rites"* (礼), yet the **elaborate funerals** (雕丧) are such as these. When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) is abandoned, there is **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义).

○ **Imperial Commentary** (御注): When **purity is dispersed** (浇淳) and **simplicity is lost** (散朴), the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) does not prevail. Daily, **benevolence** (仁) and **righteousness** (义) arise, yet they are but small accomplishments (小成遂作). The **moist and weak** (濡沬) stem from insufficiency, while **decay and exhaustion** (凋弊) arise from **action** (有为). Yet the **sage’s intent** (圣人救伐之心) is never different; the **traces of leveling and smoothing** (夷险之迹) cannot be unified.

○ **Imperial Exegesis** (御疏): The **Great Dao/Way** (大道) refers to the time when **purity was dispersed** (浇漓) and **simplicity was lost** (散朴). The **mysterious wind** (玄晏之风) of the **Dao/Way** (道) is extinguished, and the **tranquil transformation** (穆清之化) does not exist. They have lost the **highest virtue/power** (至道) of **non-action** (无为), hence it is said to be abandoned. When abandoned, there arises **compassionate love** (兼爱) as **benevolence** (仁) and **judging what is wrong** (裁非) as **righteousness** (义). Thus, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) are interspersed among them. Hence, *Zhuāngzi* (《庄子》) says: *"The Dao/Way is hidden in small accomplishments."* It means that **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) and others each achieve their own ends, yet cannot **greatly harmonize** (大通), hence they are called *small accomplishments* (小成).

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** (河上公) said: In the time of the **Great Dao/Way** (大道之时), **filial piety** (孝) was found in every household, and **loyalty** (忠) was found in every state. Thus, **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) were not seen. When the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) was abandoned and **evil and perversity** (恶逆) arose, then **transformations of righteousness** (化义) emerged, yet the **Dao/Way** was not transmitted.

○ **Róng** (荣) said: In the realm of **Emphasizing the Mysterious** (重玄), the **phenomena of qi** (气象) cannot be shifted, and in the **principle of utmost emptiness** (至虚之理), the **void** (空) is not yet worth discussing. If one cannot **respond and adapt** (迎随), what is the **beginning** (始) or **end** (终)? If there is no **change in flourishing and decline** (盛衰无变), what is **arising** (兴) or **abandoning** (废)? On the day of **purity and simplicity** (纯粹之日), there is no separation between **near and far, states and families** (彼此不隔、州、亲疏). In the time of **tranquility and peace** (静泰之辰), there is no distinction between **high and low, noble and ignoble** (上下不彰於贵贱). The **natural harmony** (自然符会) occurs without need for **knotted cords** (结绳). One treads upon the **Great Square** (大方), needing no **written contracts** (书契). When the **true time** (真时) reaches **oneness** (至一), it is said that the **Dao/Way** arises. When one practices **partial love** (偏爱) as **benevolence** (仁) and **judges wrongness** (裁非) as **righteousness** (义), the **corruption and shallowness** (浇薄) begin, and they cannot practice the **Dao/Way** (道), hence it is said that the **Dao/Way** is abandoned.

The times shift between **corruption and purity** (浇淳), yet the **Dao/Way** knows no rise or fall (道无兴废).
○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** This is when the **Supreme Sovereign’s Teaching** (太上之教) is abandoned.
It is said that in the **Age of Great Dao**, the **Five Virtues** (五德) are not manifest, and when **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) arise, **purity and simplicity** (淳朴) are lost. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *"Dispersing virtue and power into benevolence and righteousness is the crime of the sages."* Again, it says: *"Mutual moistening in conversation is not as good as mutual forgetting in the rivers and lakes."* The second point clarifies that **governing through wisdom** (以智治物) is the source of **artifice and deceit** (矫诈). When **wisdom and insight** (智惠) emerge, **great falsehood** (大伪) follows.
○ **御注:** Those who employ **wisdom and insight** (智惠) are about to establish laws (将立法也). When laws are enacted, deceit arises, and thus **great falsehood** emerges. Even **sealing official seals** (窃符玺) cannot be trusted.
○ **御疏:** When **wisdom** (智慧) emerges, it refers to later generations using wisdom to legislate, establishing laws to curb the people and decrees to punish deceit. Fearing disbelief, they create **seals and insignia** (符玺) to authenticate them. Fearing injustice, they use **measuring tools** (斗斛) to quantify. Yet, the unvirtuous steal seals and measuring tools, undermining the original intent of wisdom’s laws. Thus, wisdom’s governance only magnifies deceit, hence it is said that **great falsehood** arises.
○ **River Master (河上公) says:** The **wise ruler** (智慧之君) devalues **virtue** (德) and prizes **words** (言), devalues **substance** (质) and prizes **ornament** (文). The people respond in kind, and this becomes the root of **great falsehood and deceit** (大伪奸诈).
○ **Honor’s Commentary (荣曰):** **Dim and silent** (昏昏默默) is the **ultimate of the Dao**. **Obscure and murky** (昧昧晦晦) is the **peak of practice** (行之至). Unable to shine without dazzling, they abandon **knowledge and convention** (去知与故), adorn **wisdom** (饰智慧) to astonish the simple, and vie in **right and wrong** (竞是非) to lead the masses. When **right and wrong** alternate endlessly, **deceit and cunning** multiply. **Thieves and bandits** (盗跖) tread this as the **Dao**, while **ambitious ministers** (田成) exploit it to usurp the state—this is **great falsehood**.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** **Wisdom** (智慧) here refers to **sagely wisdom** (圣智). When the **sage governs through wisdom**, laws and decrees proliferate, and the people respond with countless deceits to evade punishment. They even steal the **sage’s wisdom** as tools for falsehood—**wisdom’s harm** is fully revealed in *Zhuangzi’s* text.

The third point distinguishes the **arising of loyalty and filial piety** (忠孝之兴) as the cause of **chaos** (因乎为乱). When **six kinships** (六亲) are not harmonious, **filial piety and kindness** (孝慈) emerge.
○ **御注:** Father, son, husband, wife, brothers—these are the **six kinships** (六亲). When **kinship and affinity lack order** (疏戚无伦), they are not harmonious (不和). Each clings to their own kin and children, and thus **filial piety and kindness** arise. All stem from abandoning the **Dao**, hence these **partial names** emerge.
○ **御疏:** The **six kinships** (六亲) are father, son, brothers, and spouses. In the **Age of Great Harmony**, there is no selfish kinship. When **superior and inferior** become discordant, **grievances and favors** arise, leading to **pillow-warming and blanket-sharing**, which people call **filial piety**. Covering when entering, shielding when exiting, which people call **kindness**. Though adorned with the names of **filial piety and kindness**, they bear the air of **self-aggrandizement**, unaware that in the **Age of Great Dao**, the world is a single household, with the **sovereign supporting above and soothing below**—a natural order. To view others as oneself, not just loving one’s own kin, then **all under heaven may be filial**. If others treat you as oneself, not just cherishing one’s own children, then **all under heaven may be kind**. Thus, where do the names of **filial piety and kindness** apply?
○ **River Master (河上公) says:** When the **six bonds of kinship** (六纪) are severed and **kinsfolk are discordant**, then **filial piety and kindness** arise to nurture one another.
○ **Honor’s Commentary (荣曰):** Father, son, brothers, and spouses—these are the **six kinships**. When distinctions blur, **right and wrong cease**, yet **long and short** contrast, giving rise to **likes and dislikes**. Harmony is marked by **disharmony**, and **filial piety** is established through **ingratitude**.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** The **six kinships** are father, son, brothers, and spouses. In an age of **pure harmony**, partial love is not yet manifest. When the **six bonds of kinship** (六纪) are disordered, **filial piety and kindness** take form. Thus, when **Zhou’s virtue declined**, **corruption and competition** surged, leading to **Zengzi and Min’s** exalted **filial piety** as a display of virtue.
When a state is **in chaos and darkness**, **loyal ministers** (忠臣) arise.
○ **御注:** In times of **great peace**, all are self-sufficient—what need is there for such names?

The days of chaos and darkness see **loyal ministers** risking their lives to save their lord—then **loyal ministers** arise.

○ **御疏:** Loyalty is the duty of a subject, yet why speak of **"loyal ministers"**? It is because the ruler fails to govern his ministers properly, allowing flatterers to advance, to serve a **corrupt lord**, and thus bring about calamity. Then those who see danger and risk death to rescue the state earn the name **"loyal ministers."**
When the **Dao/Way** flourishes in its purity, with **non-action** and tranquility, the multitude of **noble worthies** are all **Qí-Lóng**—virtuous and sagely—with **proper relationships** in order, and none but **natural conduct**. Only then do the names **"loyalty"** and **"filial piety"** fade, and the **pure and unadorned Dao/Way** prevail. What need then for **"loyal ministers"**?
These four are the extreme of decline—how could they not return to **purity and simplicity**?

○ **River Above Master (河上公) says:** When **governance fails**, the ruler and subjects blame each other, and **wicked schemers** vie for power—then **"loyal ministers"** arise to rescue their lord.
This shows that in a world of **great peace**, none know **benevolence**; when all desires vanish, none know **tranquility**; when all act purely for themselves, none know **integrity**.
In the **Age of the Great Dao/Way**, **benevolence and righteousness** fade, **filial piety and kindness** vanish—just as at high noon, the sun’s brilliance obscures the stars.

○ **Master Róng (荣) says:** In the time of **Xī and Nóng**, no need was heard of **supporting ministers**; in the days of **Jié and Zhòu**, only then were **loyal ministers** like **Guān Yǔ and Bǐ Gān** praised.
Thus, when the sun shines brightly in the sky, the stars cannot compete in their radiance; when the timely rains fall, the irrigation channels cannot claim their merit. If the lord is **corrupt above** and the ministers **rebellious below**, yet one arises to **support the lord internally** and **pacify external threats**, then the name **"loyal minister"** shines forth.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** A **sovereign of a great state** rules over the **Four Seas** as his domain. Thus, in times of **perfect governance**, **loyalty** is unseen; in times of **chaos**, **virtuous integrity** becomes manifest. Hence, **Lóng Fēng** was renowned in **Xià Jié’s** reign, and **Bǐ Gān** was praised in **Shāng Zhòu’s** time.

**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage, Abandoning Wisdom**
This chapter follows the previous because the last spoke of the **Great Dao/Way** having declined, and thus **sages and wise men** arose. Hence, this chapter urges **discarding the sage and abandoning wisdom**, returning to the **Supreme Dao/Way**.

Now, dividing the meaning of this chapter into three parts:
1. **First**, it clarifies that **discarding the sage and abandoning wisdom** brings **great benefits**, to guide beginners.
2. **Second**, it laments that the **Great Vehicle** cannot be grasped by inferior capacities.
3. **Third**, it briefly opens the essential gate, guiding beginners onward.

---
**1. First, it clarifies that discarding the sage and abandoning wisdom brings great benefits, to guide beginners.**

A **ruler who embraces the Dao/Way**, concentrating his mind in inward illumination, then **his body aligns with the earth’s vastness** and **nurtures all**, his **virtue/power** is **round and luminous**, **pure and clear**. He **transcends the dust of the ages**, **serene in the world’s subtlety**, **free from worldly wisdom**, and **acts beyond conventional thought**.
Like **Yáo**, his virtue **spreads universally beneath Heaven**; like **Shùn**, his **virtue/power** flows **unobstructed across the land**. Then all things **fulfill their nature in the Dao/Way**, and affairs **rest in the True**. Thus, **artifice and deceit vanish from human conduct**, and **loyalty and filial piety** return to **natural inclination**.
To **practice these three**, one finds **self-sufficiency**—why seek the **four limbs of knowledge** or **many learned words**? **"Seeing the unadorned"** requires **little thought**; this is a **later warning**.

**Discarding the sage, abandoning wisdom—**
the people’s benefit is **a hundredfold**.

○ **御注:** **Discarding the sage’s** teachings and traces, then **transformation rests in non-action**. **Abandoning worldly wisdom’s** deceit, then **people return to purity and simplicity**. **Purity and simplicity** mean **artifice and deceit do not arise**; **non-action** means **self-aggrandizement is not practiced**.
When **heaven and humanity** are in harmony, and **all things lose not their nature**, then the people enjoy **a hundredfold benefit**.

○ **御疏:** **"Sage"** refers to those who **craft and create**; **"wisdom"** refers to **worldly cunning and deceit**. The **sage’s craft** leaves traces, and **worldly wisdom** is not true.
Losing **truth** gives rise to **artifice and deceit**; following **traces** leads to **losing the root**. Thus, both must be **discarded and abandoned** to preserve **purity and simplicity**.
When **heavenly harmony** flows freely and **self-aggrandizement** ceases, the people gain **a hundredfold benefit**.

○ **River Above Master (河上公) says:** **"Discarding the sage"** means **rejecting crafted institutions**, returning to **primordial simplicity**. The **Five Emperors** drew symbols, **Cāng Jié** invented writing—yet this is inferior to the **Three Sovereigns’** **knotted cords without script**.
**"Abandoning wisdom"** means **rejecting clever stratagems**, returning to **non-action**. The people’s benefit is **a hundredfold**: **agriculture flourishes**, and **public and private** are **unified**.

○ **Master Róng (荣) says:** **"Sage"** is what the **common mind** reveres; **"wisdom"** is what the **foolish seek**. Without **wisdom**, how could one **discern circumstances**? Without the **sage**, how could one **govern affairs**? Yet now it is said to **discard and abandon**—this is unheard of.
When the **sage arises**, **thieves multiply**; when **wisdom is used**, **bandits appear**. Now it is said to **discard**—then **thieves and bandits do not rise**. The benefit is indeed **great**; briefly, it is **a hundredfold**.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):** **Discarding** the **named sage**, **abandoning** **discriminating wisdom**, all return to their **roots**—the benefit is **extremely great**. Speaking of **"a hundredfold"** is but **taking the greater number**.
Thus, *Zhuāngzǐ* says: **"Rú wine is thin, Hán Dān is besieged—when the sage appears, great thieves arise."**
Again, **Tián Chéngzǐ**, with his **sage-like wisdom**, **seized the state of Qí**—such are the examples.

---
**Discarding benevolence, abandoning righteousness—**
the people **return to filial piety and kindness**.

○ **御注:** **Discarding** the **benevolence of universal love**, **abandoning** the **righteousness of judging right and wrong**, then the people **return to great filial piety and kindness**.

○ **御疏:** The previous chapter spoke of the **Great Dao/Way’s** decline and the rise of **benevolence and righteousness**. Now it says to **discard benevolence and abandon righteousness**, yet the people **return to filial piety and kindness**, showing that in the **age of the Great Dao/Way**, **"mystical unity"** prevailed—**no private kin existed**, all were **kind and filial**.
Thus, when **principles are perfect**, **traces vanish**; when **affairs are right**, **names fade**.
Now, when the **six bonds of kinship** are **broken**, then the **names of filial piety and kindness** shine forth. If **universal love** is **discarded** and **judging righteousness** is **abandoned**, then **no stains of partiality remain in the rivers and lakes**, and **filial kindness** rests in **natural substance**. Thus, the people **return to great filial piety and kindness**.

○ **River Above Master (河上公) says:** **"Discarding benevolence"** means **rejecting the kindness of benevolence**; **"abandoning righteousness"** means **rejecting the superficiality of righteousness**.

The people **return to filial piety and kindness**, for **virtue/power** and **cultivation** are pure and simple.

○ **Honor** says: **Benevolence** loves all things, **righteousness** yields to others—though these are daily **principles for nurturing humanity**, they are also **artificial corrections of human nature**. Now, **discarding** such **artificial benevolence and righteousness**, we **return to innate filial piety and kindness**.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary**: **Rejecting** the **one-sided emphasis of benevolence**, **abandoning** the **obstinate adherence to righteousness**, all act in accordance with their **true nature**, without **artifice or pretense**. Filial piety arises from **heavenly principle**, kindness flows from **natural substance**. Thus, they **revert to ancient simplicity**, and it is said the people **return**.

As *Zhuangzi* says: *"Benevolence and righteousness are the thatched huts of ancient kings, already discarded like old dog-food."* Again: *"If you eliminate the conduct of the historians Zeng and Shi, all will be benevolent."* **Discarding skill and abandoning gain**, thieves and robbers **will not exist**.

○ **Official Annotation**: People **boast of their partial talents**, each harboring **contention for profit**, so **discarding skill** means **no contention**, **abandoning gain** means **self-sufficiency**—sufficiency **prevents theft and robbery**.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary**: **Discarding skill** means **rejecting false, excessive, and licentious craft**. **Abandoning gain** means **rejecting greed, monopolies, and exploitation**. Thieves and robbers arise from **covetousness and insufficiency**; now, **discarding skill** removes contention, **abandoning gain** ensures sufficiency—**who would then become thieves or robbers?** Hence, it is said **none exist**.

○ **River Above Master** says: **Discarding skill**—**deception and falsity corrupt truth**. **Abandoning gain**—**blocking the path to wealth, closing the gates of power**. Thieves and robbers **will not exist**; above, **virtue/power** is **public and just**, below, **no deceit or private gain remains**.

○ **Honor** says: **Severing the artisan Ku’s fingers**, **quelling the scheming mind**—this is **discarding skill**. **Destroying jade and shattering pearls**—this is **abandoning gain**. But thieves act **for gain**; if treasures yield **no profit**, who would steal?

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary**: **Rejecting perverse skill**, **abandoning acquisitive gain**, all **abide by their proper measure**—thus, **no plundering occurs**. As *Zhuangzi* says: *"In the time of Shennong, skilled artisans’ fingers were severed—all were then skilled."* **This is a general lament for the Great Vehicle’s inability to awaken lower capacities.**

These three principles **are insufficient as doctrine alone**, so **they are followed by further guidance**.

○ **Official Annotation**: These three **must be discarded**, yet **no method of cultivation is shown**—thus, the text is **insufficient as teaching**, and **further guidance is provided below**.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary**: The three refer to:
1. **Discarding the Sage and abandoning wisdom**,
2. **Discarding benevolence and abandoning righteousness**,
3. **Discarding skill and abandoning gain**.

Though these three **are insufficient as doctrine**, the **four practices below** **exceed in self-cultivation**. To **restrain evil at its root**, one must **draw from inner conduct**.

○ **River Above Master** says: **"Seeing true simplicity, embracing natural purity"**—**seeing true simplicity** means **holding to simplicity and truth, rejecting artificial adornment**. **Embracing natural purity** means **embracing genuine simplicity to guide others, making it worthy of emulation**. **"Few private desires, scant covetousness"**—**know contentment**.

○ **Honor** says: **Purity** is **origin**—**untainted by the myriad phenomena**. **Embracing unity without deviation**—this is **embracing purity**. **Impartial without favor**—this is **few private desires**. **Guiding emotion by nature**—this is **scant covetousness**.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary**: **Seeing true simplicity**—**removing artificiality**. **Embracing natural purity**—**returning to reality**. **Few private desires**—**public justice**. **Scant covetousness**—**avoiding greed**.

**Chapter Twenty: The Chapter on Discarding Learning**
This chapter follows the previous one because the prior chapter **discarded Sage-wisdom to eliminate entanglements**, and this chapter **addresses cause and effect**—since **causes produce results**, it follows accordingly.

This chapter is divided into five sections:
1. **Exhorting to discard learning**, showing **no distinction between good and evil**,
2. **Pointing out illusory dust that should not be indulged**,
3. **Enumerating the states of beings indulging in such dust**,
4. **Contrasting the Sage’s enlightenment with the vulgar’s delusion**,
5. **Exclusively revealing the Sage’s partial use of the Dao**.

---
**First Section: Exhorting to Discard Learning, Showing No Distinction Between Good and Evil**

Within the **uppermost realm of alchemical refinement**, in the **secret domain of profound techniques**, **true speech** resounds **faintly**, preserved in the **jewelry vaults of eternity**. **Immortal hymns** chime **crystal-clear**, radiating from **golden scriptures** in **distant brilliance**. **Treasure is stored therein**; perhaps the **myriad scrolls** remain **sealed long**, like **autumn waters flowing freely** or **spring platforms left untouched**.

**Discarding the learning of artificial doing**, one **settles into inner truth**. Facing **good and evil alike**, one **forgets both**; **comprehending the One**, one **transcends duality**. How could one **pursue human affairs**, **driven by defilements**, **spreading like weeds in the vulgar world**, **lingering in the realms of Zheng and Wei**? The **Great Sage** **decays from this**, hence **discards and departs**.

**Ceasing Learning Brings Peace**

**Commentary by the Master:**
To abandon the artificial learning of the vulgar world, one preserves the purity of nature undisturbed. With few desires and little selfishness, one attains true rest and freedom from care.

**Exegesis:**
Those who cease learning do so by abandoning the artificial learning of the vulgar world. All humans are born with an innate purity. The more one exceeds natural limits in pursuit of learning, the more one harms this purity. If one completely ceases all action, one would leave all things unrefined. But here, it is only the excessive, artificial learning—what Zhuangzi called *vulgar learning*—that must be abandoned to return to one’s original state. As for the learning inherent to one’s nature, the superior person cultivates it diligently through action; this is not the same as ceasing learning. Thus, it is said: *Ceasing learning brings peace.*

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
Ceasing learning does not mean abandoning true learning; it means removing superficiality, thus attaining peace and rest.

**Master Yan says:**
Vulgar learning teaches one to value trifling distinctions, to know the customs of social gatherings and partisan debates. The virtuous benefit from it, but the wicked are harmed by it. Since virtuous people are few and the wicked many within the world, the benefits of learning are shallow while its harms are deep. When the wicked engage in learning, it is like a tiger gaining wings—soaring over the four seas, selecting flesh to devour. The Sage rejects this, and thus the world rests in peace, transforming without instruction and submitting without command.

**Master Rong says:**
If one’s aspiration is the Dao of non-action, then there is no need for learning. Blending the wise and foolish, one does not hear of gain or loss. In advancing or retreating, one remains in forgetfulness, unaffected by praise or blame. Embracing the natural Way, how could there be any care?

Those who cling to artificial pursuits learn not for themselves but for external gain—straining their heads and piercing their thighs to compete for fame, studying by candlelight to contend for profit. They fear that their reputation will not stand, that their gains will not come, and thus anxiety arises.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*"Worry"* means burdensome cares. To abandon learning rooted in artificial distinctions and merge with the principle of non-action is to exhaust all burdens, hence there is no worry.

How far apart are *"yes"* and *"agree"*? How different are *"good"* and *"evil"*?

**Commentary by the Master:**
*"Yes"* is a respectful response; *"agree"* is a careless one. Though both emerge from the mouth, one is said to be close. A respectful response is good, while a careless one is evil. This illustrates that ceasing vulgar learning brings peace, while failing to do so breeds suffering—all depending on the mind’s reflection. How could the distance be great?

**Exegesis:**
*"Yes"* means to respond appropriately. The *Rites* say: *"When the master summons, do not answer with ‘yes’ before rising."*

*"Agree"* is a careless response. The *Book of Han* says: *"Who dares to question?"*—meaning, *"Who dares to ask?"* This is an illustrative analogy. Though *"yes"* and *"agree"* both come from the mouth, one is respectful and good, the other careless and evil. If learning is not abandoned, the fault lies in the mind; but if abandoned, there is no worry—only if neglected does suffering arise. Since both emerge from the mouth, they are said to be close. But the distinction lies in the heart, hence the question: *How far apart are they?*

If one realizes that learning and non-learning are both empty, that all distinctions are void, and forgets knowing in knowing, then *"yes"* and *"agree"* become equal, and good and evil are both forgotten.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
*"Yes"* and *"agree"* are both responses, yet how close they are—how the times despise substance while valuing form. Good and evil—how different they are! The good are praised, the evil are reproached. How far apart can they be? Does the age despise the honest and honor the flatterer?

**Master Rong says:**
*"Yes"* is the proper response in ritual; *"agree"* is the informal reply. What aligns with the heart is good; what contradicts it is evil. *"How close"* means the distance is not great. To embody the Dao is to dispel all concerns; to follow nature is to find all paths suitable. In truth, there is neither opposition nor compliance, neither beauty nor ugliness. Yet artificial distinctions force separation, giving rise to partiality and delusion. One clings to trivialities, neglecting the realm of virtue and morality, demanding only superficial propriety. If it pleases the heart, it is called *"right,"* regardless of wisdom or folly. If it flatters oneself, it is called *"able,"* without regard for intelligence or ignorance. Thus, the wise become as foolish as the unwise, and the virtuous as base as the wicked. Hence, it is said: *"How close they are."*

It is also said that human nature is inherently fixed. To nurture it excessively leads to loss, to advance intelligence for empty praise, to adorn deceit for wicked deeds—*"yes"* and *"agree"* differ only slightly, hence *"how close they are."*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*"Yes"* is a respectful affirmation; *"agree"* is a careless response. The *Rites* state: *"When the master summons, do not answer with ‘yes.’"* *"How close"* means they are not distant. People fail to grasp the distinction between compliance and defiance, recklessly generating joy or anger. Hearing *"yes"* is deemed good, hearing *"agree"* provokes anger, unaware that both sounds issue from the same mouth and are not truly distant. Thus, it is said: *"How close they are."*

Good and evil—how different they are! What aligns with intention is good; what defies it is evil. Once compliance and defiance are seen as empty, where do good and evil reside? Moreover, *"yes"* and *"agree"* arise from one mouth, while good and evil stem from one heart. Those who forget know their indistinguishability, while those who cling are as divided as Chu and Yue. Yet those ensnared by artificial learning are many, and within the mix of right and wrong, joy and anger, *"yes"* and *"agree,"* lies the root of all suffering. This is why abandoning it brings peace—these pairs merely illustrate the need to abandon clinging to learning.

**The Second Point: Do Not Dwell in the Dust of Delusion**
What people fear, one must truly fear.

**Commentary by the Master:**
What ordinary people fear is arrogance and evil. What the virtuous fear is vulgar learning and artificial doing. All must be abandoned, hence one must truly fear them.

**Exegesis:**
What people fear is arrogance and evil. Arrogance leads to excess; evil invites censure.

「被嫌则人所弃薄，为过则物多尤怨。以况有为俗学，增长是非，若不畏而绝之，是皆违分伤性，故不可不畏而绝之也。

To be censured means to be abandoned by others; to commit faults means to invite blame from all. And yet, conventional learning and artificial pursuits only amplify distinctions of right and wrong. If one does not fear and abandon them, they all violate the Dao and harm one’s nature—thus they must truly be feared and abandoned.

○河上公曰：人之所畏，人谓道人，所畏者，畏不绝学为之君也。不可不畏，近令色，杀仁贤也。

River Shang Master said: What people fear is called "Daoist" (道人), for they fear that learning will become their sovereign. If not feared and abandoned, it will lead to lust and destroy virtue and wisdom.

○荣曰：水火可畏，不畏必遭烧溺，豺狼可畏，不畏终遇於损伤，故知人行爱憎而不已，归兹损败，贪名利而无息，致此危亡。

Honor said: Water and fire are to be feared, for failing to fear them brings certain burning and drowning. Predators are to be feared, for failing to fear them invites harm. Thus, one sees that relentless attachment to likes and dislikes leads to ruin, and insatiable greed for fame and gain brings perilous destruction.

今流俗滞之有溺之忘反，莽莽欲出无期。

Now, the common folk are mired in delusion, drowning in forgetfulness, yet recklessly strive to emerge without end.

○成疏：学人之所畏，谓生死及诸尘也，不可不畏，叉没溺也。前绝示善恶皆空，恐滞斯文，遂染尘境，故发此句以戒之。

Master Cheng’s Exegesis: What scholars fear are life and death, as well as all worldly entanglements. If not feared, they will perish in them. Earlier, it was shown that right and wrong are both empty; yet fearing stagnation in this teaching, they fall into the dust of worldly affairs—thus this sentence is issued as a warning.

第三泛列众生耽染之状。荒兮其未央哉。

**The Third Point: The General Condition of Sentient Beings’ Indulgence**
How desolate and endless it is!

御注：若不畏绝俗学，则众生正性荒废，其未有央止之时。

River Shang Master’s Commentary: If one does not fear and abandon conventional learning, then the true nature of sentient beings will be squandered, and there will be no end to their ruin.

○御疏：荒，荒废也。慢恶为过，俗学失真，是皆可畏，故当弃绝。若不绝而弃之，则正性荒废，其未有央止时。《诗》曰：夜未央，言更漏尚多也。此云其未央，言俗学伤性无息止期，故前途尚多，云未央也。

Master Cheng’s Exegesis: "Ungoverned" (荒) means desolation. Arrogance and evil are faults; conventional learning loses its truth—these are all things to be feared, hence they must be discarded. If they are not discarded but merely abandoned, then the true nature will be squandered, and there will be no end to its ruin. The *Book of Odes* says: *"The night knows no end"* (夜未央), meaning the water clock still has much time to flow. Here, "no end" speaks of how conventional learning harms nature without cessation, so the path ahead remains boundless.

○河上公曰：世俗之人荒乱，欲学为进文，未央止也。

River Shang Master said: The common folk are chaotic and reckless, striving to learn for advancement, yet there is no end to their striving.

○成疏：荒是眇莽，叹其久远。央是尽义，嗟其未息。言众生染滞之心，其日固久，执着情笃，未有休时。

Master Cheng’s Exegesis: "Ungoverned" (荒) is a state of vast confusion, lamenting its prolonged existence. "End" (央) signifies completion, yet it is mourned that there is no rest. The words describe how sentient beings’ minds are stained and ensnared, their days long, their attachments deep, and their restlessness without pause.

众人熙熙，如享太牢，如春登台。

The masses bustle and rejoice, like feasting on the grandest sacrificial meats, like ascending the spring platform in revelry.

御注：众人俗学有为，熙熙逐境，如临享太牢，春台登望，动生贪欲。

River Shang Master’s Commentary: The common folk indulge in conventional learning and artificial pursuits, their emotions stirred and desires aroused, as if they were about to feast on the grandest sacrificial meats or ascend the spring platform to gaze upon the world.

○御疏：熙熙者，情欲淫动之貌。此明不畏绝俗学之人也。夫俗学有学为，动生情欲，熙熙逐境，役役终身，如馁夫之临享太牢，恣贪滋味，怡容之春台登望，动生爱着。太牢者，牛羊豕也。春台所以为爱着，谓其卉木滋荣，禽乌呜匹，阳和陶然，易淫荡也。

Master Cheng’s Exegesis: "Bustling and rejoicing" (熙熙) depicts the unrestrained movement of emotions and desires. This illustrates those who do not fear and abandon conventional learning. Such learning, with its artificial pursuits, stirs emotions and desires, driving them to chase after transient things, enslaving them for life. It is like a starving man before a grand sacrificial feast, greedily indulging in flavors, or a contented person ascending the spring platform to gaze upon verdant fields, where love and attachment are easily kindled. The "grand sacrificial meats" (太牢) refer to oxen, sheep, and pigs. The spring platform invites attachment because its lush vegetation, the harmonious calls of birds, and the gentle warmth of the season all stir unbridled passion.

故《豳诗》云：春日迟迟，探蘩祁祁，女心伤悲，迨及公子同归。

Thus the *Book of Odes* says: *"The spring days linger on"* (春日迟迟), *"the picking of wild plants is frequent"* (探蘩祁祁), *"the maiden’s heart is wounded with sorrow"* (女心伤悲), *"until the noble son returns with her"* (迨及公子同归).

○河上公曰：众人熙熙，熙熙，淫佚多情砍。如享太牢，如饥思太牢之具，意无足时也。如春登台，春阴阳交通，万物感动，登台观之，志意淫佚。

River Shang Master said: The masses bustle and rejoice, their desires unrestrained and emotions overflowing. Like feasting on the grand sacrificial meats, they crave them as if starving, their intentions never sated. Like ascending the spring platform, where yin and yang merge and all things are stirred, they gaze upon it, their wills and desires lost in indulgence.

○荣曰：熙熙，悦乐也。太牢，味也。春台，色也。言流俗众人务学以规名声，纵情以昏色味，悦之以目，不知盲之有时。适之以口，不知爽之有日。逐欲老而愈溢，劳形困而不休，仍自欣欣以为悦乐也。

Honor said: "Bustling and rejoicing" (熙熙) is delight and pleasure. The "grand sacrificial meats" (太牢) are flavors; the "spring platform" (春台) is color. The common folk strive in learning to seek fame, indulge emotions in the murky shades of taste and color, and gratify the senses with eyes and mouths—yet they do not know that blindness has its limits or that satiety has its day. As they age in their pursuit of desires, their cravings only grow more excessive; their bodies weary yet they rest not, yet they still take pride in their endless pleasure.

○成疏：言耽染者众，故云众人，即众生之别称也。熙熙，悦乐也。享，燕享也。太牢，牛羊豕也。言众生欣爱声色，情染极深，如饥人享太牢之馔，悦美色之甚，又如春日登台，眺望林野，畅适其心也。

Master Cheng’s Exegesis: It speaks of how many are ensnared, hence "the masses" (众人), another term for sentient beings. "Bustling and rejoicing" (熙熙) is delight and pleasure. "Feast" (享) means to enjoy a banquet. The "grand sacrificial meats" (太牢) are oxen, sheep, and pigs. The words describe how sentient beings are captivated by sounds and colors, their emotions deeply entangled—like a starving man feasting on grand sacrificial meats, or like ascending the spring platform on a spring day to gaze upon forests and fields, finding their hearts fully satisfied.

第四对辨圣人之悟，以治凡鄙之迷。

**The Fourth Point: Contrasting the Sage’s Awakening with the Common Folks’ Illusion**

我独泊兮其未兆，若婴儿之未孩。

I alone remain tranquil, my nature yet unmanifested—like an infant before its first smile.

御注：我独泊然安静，於情欲略无形，如彼婴儿，未能孩孺也。

River Shang Master’s Commentary: I alone remain tranquil and still, with no trace of emotions or desires. It is like that infant, which has not yet begun to smile and play.

○御疏：我者，老君自称，言我畏绝俗学，学道含和，独能泊然安静，於彼代间有为之事，情欲等法，略无形兆。如彼婴儿，未孩笑，无分别也。孩者，别人之意。《庄子》曰：不至于孩而始谁。

Master Cheng’s Exegesis: "I" (我) is the self-reference of the Old Master (老君). It states that I fear and abandon conventional learning, practice the Dao with harmony, and alone am able to remain tranquil and still. Toward the transient affairs of the world, emotions, and desires, I show no form or trace. Like that infant, I have not yet begun to smile or distinguish things. "Infant" (孩) refers to the mind of one who does not yet separate. *Zhuangzi* says: *"Only when one does not reach the stage of infantile simplicity does one begin to be confused."*

○河上公曰：我独泊兮其未兆，我独泊然安静，未有情欲之形兆也。如婴兄之未孩，如小儿未能答偶人时。

River Shang Master said: "I alone remain tranquil" (我独泊兮其未兆), meaning I alone remain tranquil and still, with no trace of emotions or desires. Like a younger brother who has not yet begun to smile, or like a child who cannot yet respond to others.

○荣曰：圣人言众人驰骛於有为之境，为声色之所动，我澹泊於无为之端，香味不能惑，犹如赤子未识牝牡之合，不知淫佚之情，心无所在，岂定有归也。

Honor said: The Sage speaks of how the common folk rush about in the world of artificial pursuits, moved by sounds and colors. I, however, remain serene at the Dao of non-action, unaffected by fragrances or flavors—like an infant who does not yet know the union of male and female, nor the emotions of lust and indulgence. My heart is without attachment; how could it have a fixed abode?

○成疏：我魄未兆，我，老君自称也。魄，寂也。兆，状。言圣人虽处俗尘，而心知寂魄，不为前境之所牵，故都无攀绿之萌状也。若婴儿未孩，魁无所归，婴儿，赤子也，孩，笑也，魁，宽大也，归，住着也。

Master Cheng’s Exegesis: "My nature yet unmanifested" (我魄未兆), where "I" (我) is the Old Master’s self-reference. "Nature" (魄) means stillness; "manifested" (兆) means form. The Sage, though dwelling in the dust of the world, knows the stillness of their nature and is not drawn by what lies before them—thus they show no trace of grasping at transient pleasures. Like an infant before its first smile, their nature is boundless and without fixed abode. An infant is a newborn child; "smile" (孩) refers to the first signs of joy. "Boundless" (魁) means vast and unrestrained; "abode" (归) signifies dwelling and attachment.

The Sage moves without defying stillness, dwells amid defilement yet remains unstained—
like an infant before its first smile, when both heart and form are pure.
Yet their wisdom is boundless and vast, their capacity vast as the empty sky,
a boat without a fixed mooring, drifting where the current wills.

*Buying buying*—as if without destination.
**Master Yu’s Annotation:** The Perfect One has no heart; movement follows things without taking or giving,
like a traveler with no place to return to.
*Buying buying*—the likeness of motion.
**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** *Buying buying*—the appearance of motion.

The common crowd moves and clings, ever grasping, ever seeking—
thus they seem to have a place to go.
I have no heart, serene and at ease;
I ride the current and pass, meet obstacles and halt.
Like one who walks the Dao, with nowhere to hasten—
no restless striving.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** I drift like a rustic in the wilderness, with nowhere to seek.

The common crowd all have excess.
**Master Yu’s Annotation:** They indulge in worldly affairs, boast of cleverness and wisdom,
and claim to have abundance, as if to display their grandeur.
**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** The common crowd all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.
The common crowd cling to vulgar learning, boast of cleverness and wisdom—
these are all attachments they hold.
They claim to have abundance, while I alone diminish and never linger,
my heart untouched by love or defilement—
thus I seem forgotten.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** The common crowd hoard wealth for extravagance,
hoard wisdom for deceit.

**Master Rong says:** The common crowd all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.
The vulgar, in purity, feel lacking; in filth, they overflow.
They amass wealth as external burdens, indulge desires to deepen inner defilement.
The Sage remains unstained by dust, abandons worldly affairs—
thus they seem abandoned.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** The common crowd all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.
The common crowd cling to what they possess, thus they are stained by excess.
The Sage’s wisdom embodies emptiness, alone abandoning and taking nothing.

Yet I alone seem abandoned.
**Master Yu’s Annotation:** Always as if insufficient, as if forgotten.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** I alone seem abandoned, as if lacking.

My heart is that of a simple fool—
pure and unadorned.
**Master Yu’s Annotation:** Am I truly the heart of a fool, forgotten like this?
But my heart is pure and unadorned—
thus I seem abandoned.

**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** In all things, I embody non-attachment—
thus I seem forgotten. How could I be like the heart of a fool?
But my heart is pure and unadorned, simple and without love or desire—
thus I say, I seem abandoned.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** My heart is that of a simple fool—
not following the vulgar, steadfast in the One, unmoved.

Pure and unadorned—
without distinction.

**Master Rong says:** The vulgar are foolish, yet they deem themselves wise.
Some are ever deeper in desire’s filth,
until the Sage’s great wisdom seems like folly—
form and spirit serene and empty,
pure and white, ever thus.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *Pure*—unmixed.
The Sage’s wisdom is empty and white, pure and refined,
like the simple fool’s heart, without distinction.

The vulgar are bright and discerning—
**Master Yu’s Annotation:** Boasting of cleverness and wisdom.
**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** The vulgar are bright and discerning, while I alone seem dim.

The vulgar are sharp and probing—
I alone am dull and obscured.
*Bright and discerning*—they pride themselves in cleverness and artifice.
*Dim*—like one lost in confusion, without distinction.
*Sharp and probing*—they impose laws to judge others.
*Dull and obscured*—the breadth of simplicity.

Thus the bright and discerning boast of cleverness,
the sharp and probing impose laws—
all because they never sever from vulgar learning and worldly action.
Hence the Sage fears severance as if it were dimness and silence.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** Clear and penetrating.

**Master Rong says:** Though they speak much, they know not the inner clarity of the heart,
nor the radiance that shines outward.
They proclaim their own understanding—
thus they say, *bright and discerning*.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** The vulgar are bright and discerning, while I alone seem dim.
The vulgar’s hearts are dark and confused, yet they brightly distinguish—
they dazzle themselves with their abilities.
The Sage’s wisdom is empty and vast, bright as sun and moon,
yet they conceal their light and hide their brilliance—
thus they seem dim.

I alone seem dim.
**Master Yu’s Annotation:** Self-effacing.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** Like one in darkness.

**Master Rong says:** Knowing yet feigning ignorance, as if in shadow.

The vulgar are sharp and probing—
**Master Yu’s Annotation:** They establish laws and regulations.
**Master He Shang Gong says:** Hasty and swift, establishing laws and regulations.
**Master Rong says:** Their passions are sharp in the realm of right and wrong,
their hearts fixed on paths of gain and loss.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** The vulgar are sharp and probing, I alone am dull and obscured.
Sharp and probing—this is the heart of distinction.
Dull and obscured—this is the wisdom of non-distinction.
But the vulgar’s hearts cling to what they possess,
they probe right and wrong, and rush in haste.
The Sage’s wisdom is empty and void,
they embody the knowledge of illusion,
ever at ease and still.

I alone am dull and obscured.
**Master Yu’s Annotation:** Only vast and unrestrained.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** Dull and obscured—without cutting or confining.

**Master Rong says:** Abandoning the mind and perception,
thus without distinction.
Forgotten of likes and dislikes—
thus they say, *dull and obscured*.

Suddenly dim, silent as if without end.
**Master Yu’s Annotation:** Their appearance is suddenly obscured, yet silent—
cutting off from learning, as if without attachment.

**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** Those who abandon learning and walk the Dao
are suddenly without heart, ever as if dim,
yet their hearts are silent—
never clinging to anything,
thus they seem without end.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** Suddenly dim—I alone am suddenly obscured,
like the rivers and seas, whose depths are unknown.
Silent as if without end—I alone drift and rise, unbound, my will in the divine realm.

**Master Rong says:** The Dao’s expanse is vast, my heart is boundless and serene—
like the great sea stirred by wind, waves drifting east and west,
never fixed in place.

「Master Cheng’s Annotation: *晦* means *dark*, *止* means *to dwell*.
The sage’s wisdom is truly bright, yet suddenly obscured—
like a lamp that reveals its light without blazing,
thus this passage is spoken.

Though mingling with the common world,
they remain ever concentrated and tranquil,
yet never dwelling in that tranquility—
hence, without end.

All people have some purpose.

**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** All people, in their lifetimes,
have motives for pursuing worldly studies and sensory attachments.

**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** Ordinary mortals
do not fear worldly learning,
always fixated on sensory attachments,
never ceasing their pursuit.

I alone, in my lifetime,
distinguish—
while the vulgar and obstinate lack understanding.
*鄙* means *coarse and lacking*.
Yet my heart is truly enlightened—
thus it is said, *as if so*.

From *"All people bustle"* onward,
all respond to light.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** *以* means *to act*.

**Master Rong says:** *用有为* means *to employ worldly actions*.

**Master Cheng’s Annotation:** All people have some purpose,
I alone seem coarse and lacking—
while others are entangled in desire,
I never rest.
Though they gather different teachings,
we share the same root.
The sage perceives the emptiness of all phenomena,
never distinguishing between right and wrong,
nor seeing them as they are.
Like the dull and ignorant,
or the coarse and lacking.

The fifth passage alone reveals the sage’s special ability to employ the Dao.

I alone seem coarse and lacking—
**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** *顽* means lacking distinction,
*鄙* means coarse and lacking,
yet my heart is truly enlightened.

Externally appearing insufficient—
thus it is said, *as if so*.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** I alone seem coarse and lacking,
I alone act without worldly purpose,
as if lacking—
like one who does not reach.

**Master Rong says:** Like the ignorant fool’s lack of knowledge,
or the lowly’s lack of adornment.

I alone differ from others—
**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** Others have emotions and desires,
I have none.

Others oppose the Dao,
I align with it.

**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** I alone differ from others,
yet honor seeking sustenance from the Mother.
These two sentences conclude the thought.
I alone differ from others—
differing from the common folk who never abandon learning.
All teachings differ from the vulgar,
who cling to worldly desires,
while I alone cast aside emotions and desires.
Others distinguish among teachings,
I alone equate to non-duality.
Thus it is said, *I alone differ from others*.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** I alone differ from others.

**Master Rong says:** I wish to differ from others,
yet honor seeking sustenance from the Mother.
*Sustenance* means *employ*,
*Mother* means *the Dao*.
Others seek fulfillment,
without need of words.
Things lose their nature,
so the sage establishes teachings.
From *Spring Terrace* onward,
all are afflictions of worldly existence.
The sage follows the disease to cure it,
using the medicine of *non-action* to heal worldly afflictions.
The medicine is universal,
yet the application differs.
The vulgar are stuck in convention,
the sage employs the Dao—
thus it is said, *honoring seeking sustenance from the Mother*.

**Master Cheng’s Annotation:** I alone differ from others,
yet honor seeking sustenance from the Mother.
*Sustenance* means *employ*,
*Mother* means *the Dao*.
Others observe and distinguish,
I alone seem obscured and forgetful.
Distinction leads to attachment to sounds and colors,
forgetfulness leads to honoring the true Dao—
thus the difference.
Yet honor seeking sustenance from the Mother.

**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** Seeking sustenance from the Mother—
valuing like an infant without worldly desires.
Thus the earlier passage says, *like an infant before it knows speech*,
and the following scripture says, *thick with virtue, compared to a newborn babe*.
This is why I alone differ from others.

Originally without *先无求、於两字*,
now added.

Moreover, the sage’s teaching
has no need to avoid taboo.
Yet when adapted for instruction,
it may raise suspicion.
To clarify principles, the meaning cannot be altered,
but when applied in context,
it must be stable and convenient.
Convenience preserves the ancient while accommodating the present—
this is the ideal.

Again, Sima Qian says:
The *Laozi*’s five thousand words
are about clarifying principles and ceasing speech,
not necessarily fixed in number.

**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** The *Laozi* warns people
to guard simplicity and preserve harmony,
to minimize selfishness and avoid excess,
to cut off attachment to sights and sounds,
to block the pursuit of fame and fortune.
To be like an infant,
only seeking sustenance from the Mother—
thus it is said, *yet honor seeking sustenance from the Mother*.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** *Sustenance* means *employ*,
*Mother* means *the Dao*.
I alone employ the Dao.

*Chapter Twenty-One: The Appearance of the Sage’s Virtue*

The reason this chapter follows the previous:
The prior chapter expounds on the sage who abandons learning
and honors the true Dao.
This chapter elaborates on the noble bearing of such a person,
within which the text unfolds in four layers.

**First Layer:** Revealing the one who attains enlightenment,
whose appearance aligns with the Dao.

The Great Form is without shape,
the Perfect One operates in secret.
They transcend the three purities while freely indulging,
they rise above the six *qi* yet remain detached.
To know their appearance—
truly, it cannot be compared.

Dispersed, they become *qi*,
enclosing the hundred million heavens.
Gathered, they become spirit,
entering and exiting the nine *yuán* halls.
Above the Imperial City,
they ride the white clouds,
before the Pass of Han,
they float on purple *qi*.
Responding to things, they move—
like a crane returning after a thousand years.
Following the time, they act—
like a dragon leaping in five hues.
Only vague and indistinct—
the appearance of the Sage’s Virtue.

The Sage’s Virtue follows only the Dao.

**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** *孔* means *great*,
*从* means *to follow*.
Asking: What is the appearance of one with great virtue?
Their actions follow only the Dao of utmost emptiness.

**○ Imperial Commentary:**
*"Kong"* means "great."
*"Cong"* means "to follow."
*"Rong"* refers to one’s appearance.

To illuminate how a scholar aligns with the Supreme Dao, it is asked: What is the appearance of one with great virtue? It is said that the appearance of one with great virtue follows only the Dao of utmost emptiness.

**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**
*"Kong"* means "great."
The appearance of great virtue—great virtue encompasses all things, able to receive filth and impurity, dwelling in humility.
"Uniquely follows the Dao"—*"yi"* means "solely." One of great virtue does not conform to worldly conventions but follows the Dao alone.

**○ Master Rong says:**
*"Kong"* means "great," "vast," the Dao being principle and virtue.
All things are contained within it, hence it is called *rong* (appearance).
All actions conform to principle—thus it is said to "follow."
It is also said that great virtue does not arise from elsewhere but comes solely from the Dao.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*"Kong"* means "great," "vast."
*"Rong"* refers to form and appearance.
The appearance of one with vast virtue—how does it manifest? It follows the Dao, and that is its essence.
Alternatively: *"Rong"* means "to embrace."
Great virtue harmonizes subtly, thus able to remain empty and all-encompassing. In action or stillness, speech or silence, all are manifestations of the Dao.
This reveals the Dao one attains—neither existence nor nonexistence.
The Dao, as a phenomenon, is vague and indistinct.
**Imperial Commentary:** This clarifies that the Dao followed by one of great virtue is neither existent nor nonexistent, its boundless operation defying name, hence "vague and indistinct."

**○ Imperial Commentary:** This elucidates the subtle, ultimate origin as the form of things—precisely the Dao followed by one of great virtue.
The subtle, ultimate origin, forcibly named "Dao."
What is the Dao as a phenomenon? How does it move and rest in form?
It is said that this origin is neither existent nor nonexistent, difficult to name.
To call it existent, it is still and formless.
To call it nonexistent, it subtly persists.
Since it is indeterminate, it is called "vague and indistinct."

**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**
The Dao, among all things, uniquely moves in vague indistinctness.

**○ Master Rong says:**
Not yet knowing what the Dao is, yet virtue follows it clearly.
The Great Dao is profound and mysterious, too deep to comprehend.
To say it is nonexistent, yet it is formless unity.
To say it exists, yet it returns to nothingness.
Returning to nothingness yet not nonexistent—
speaking of existence yet not existent—
existence and nonexistence are indeterminate,
life and death are undefined—
hence it is called "vague and indistinct."

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
The Supreme Dao as a phenomenon—
though existent, it is nonexistent;
though nonexistent, it is existent.
Though existent, it is not existent;
though nonexistent, it is not nonexistent.
Existence and nonexistence are indeterminate—
hence it is called "vague and indistinct."
Speaking of "things" is to clarify that the Dao does not depart from things, nor do things depart from the Dao.
Outside the Dao, there are no things;
outside things, there is no Dao.
Action is the Dao and things;
essence is things and the Dao.
It also clarifies that enlightenment is the Dao and things,
delusion is things and the Dao.
The Dao and things are neither one nor different,
yet different and one,
neither one nor not one—
thus things and the Dao,
one yet not one—
neither Dao nor things,
neither things hence one,
not one hence things—
thus not one, not one.

**Thirdly, this reveals the Sage’s body as the unity of the Three.**
Vague and indistinct—
within it, forms appear.
**Imperial Commentary:**
*"Hu"* means "nonexistent."
*"Huo"* means "existent."
*"Zhao"* reveals forms.
From nonexistence descending into existence,
within it, all forms manifest.

**○ Imperial Commentary:** This clarifies the origin and its traces.
*"Hu"* means "nonexistent."
*"Huo"* means "existent."
*"Zhao"* reveals forms.
The origin is formless, hence called *"hu."*
Generation and transformation manifest form, hence called *"huo."*
Thus, from nonexistence descending into existence,
within it, all forms manifest—
from origin to trace.

**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**
Though the Dao is vague and indistinct, formless,
it alone is the pattern for all things.

**○ Master Rong says:**
Within vague indistinctness, forms exist;
within indistinctness, things exist—
the true reality of neither existence nor nonexistence,
the most profound and mysterious Dao,
splitting the One Origin to manifest the Three Forms,
harmonizing the Two *qi* to generate all things.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Within vague indistinctness, forms exist;
within indistinctness, things exist—
within things exists *shen* (spirit),
the wondrous transformation of things is named.
Though neither existent nor nonexistent,
yet existent and nonexistent—
hence it is wondrous.
Within forms exists the nonexistent;
though neither form nor color,
yet it becomes color and form—
hence it is *qi*.
The Dao manifests in varied transformations—
thus it is neither thing nor form,
yet thing and form.
Vague and indistinct—
within it, things exist.
**Imperial Commentary:**
"Things" refers to the Dao as a phenomenon mentioned above.
From existence returning to nonexistence,
restoring the Supreme Dao—
hence it is said that within it, things exist.

**○ Imperial Commentary:**
"Things" refers to the subtle origin mentioned above.
The origin descending into generation,
manifesting all forms,
cultivating nature to return to virtue—
then it returns to formlessness.
Formlessness is the Dao.
It is said that through human cultivation of nature and return to virtue,
not departing from the origin,
from existence returning to nonexistence,
subtly merging with the Supreme Dao—
hence it is said that within it, things exist—
speaking of subtle things.
This gathers traces to return to the origin.

**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**
The Dao’s vague indistinctness—
within it, there is One,
directing generation and transformation,
establishing substance through *qi*.

**Mysterious and dark—**
within it, there is essence.
**Imperial Commentary:**
Vague indistinctness in existence and nonexistence,
mysterious darkness beyond measure—
the operation of generation is exquisitely preserved.

**○ Imperial Commentary:**
"Mysterious and dark" means profound obscurity.
The ultimate emptiness descending into generation,
cultivating nature to return to virtue,
gathering traces to return to the origin—
subtle things may persist,
mysterious and dark, immeasurable,
containing transformation—
within it, there is supreme essence.

**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**
The Dao is only mysterious and dark, formless—
within it, there is essence,
the vital interaction of the numinous and the luminous,
the convergence of yin and yang.

**○ Master Rong says:**
The ultimate principle is singular, hence it is called *precise and wondrous*.
Its substance undergoes no change, hence it is called *true*.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*"Mysterious and dark"* means profound and distant.
*"Within it, there is essence"* refers to *enlightened wisdom*.
Though the Dao is mysterious and dark, formless and indistinct,
its spirit is most refined, its wisdom unbounded,
its divine function unfathomable.
Its essence is supremely true—
**within it, there is veracity.**

**Imperial Commentary:**
The essence in profound darkness
is inherently unadulterated.
When things respond, it must correspond—
its responses are never erroneous.
Hence it is said: *within it, there is veracity.*

**○ Imperial Exegesis:**
The Dao’s wondrous transformations,
rooted in authenticity, are never false.
Its generative function pervades all existence—
when things respond, they must correspond,
never deviating in the slightest.
Thus it is said: *within it, there is veracity.*

**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**
*"Its essence is supremely true"*—
the Dao’s vital essence is truly authentic,
not a false pretense.
*"Within it, there is veracity"*—
the Dao conceals its efficacy;
its veracity lies within.

**○ Master Rong says:**
Silent, without form,
yet responsive and instantly resonant—
blessing the virtuous, punishing the licentious,
its influence is ever-present.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*"Its essence is supremely true"*—
the true essence is unadulterated,
not hollow or false.
Within the *Three-in-One* (三一),
it emphasizes essence to clarify
that essence is the foundation of *radiant vitality and divine function*.
*"Within it, there is veracity"*—
the Mysterious Dao acts without intent,
yet responds to stimuli with certainty,
as reliable as the seasons,
never erring in the slightest.

The fourth insight reveals:
the Dao has no origin, no end,
yet knows both beginning and completion.
From ancient times to the present,
its name does not fade.

**Imperial Commentary:**
The Dao, from ancient times to the present,
generates all things.
Things obtain their function through the Dao,
and their names arise from their use.
Since the generative function is the same through time,
the names applied to its responses
are thus unchanging from ancient to modern.

**○ Imperial Exegesis:**
From ancient times to the present,
its essence remains unaltered.
*"Observe all origins"*—
*Observe* means to measure and discern.
*Origins* refers to their beginnings.
The Dao’s generative function,
its mysterious and true essence,
is eternal and unchanging.
Thus, things obtaining the Dao’s function—
the harmony of heaven and earth—
from ancient times to the present,
remains ever-present and unceasing.
Hence the commentary:
*"The generative function is the same through time,
so the names applied to its responses
are thus unchanging from ancient to modern."*
Through this true and veracious essence,
it measures and discerns the origins of all things,
allowing each to fulfill its generative function.

**○ Master He Shang Gong says:**
*"From"* means *following*.
The Dao follows from ancient times to the present,
ever-present and unceasing.

**○ Master Rong says:**
From ancient times to the present,
its name does not fade,
to observe all origins—
*Observe* means *to examine*,
*Origins* means *beginnings*.
The ignorant lack understanding,
common sentiment is obstructed,
and they claim that the mysterious and dark principle
is inherently severed from causes,
that within indistinctness,
there is no retribution.
Thus, those who do good grow lax,
and the wicked persist unrepentant.
They fail to recognize that essence is alive,
how could they know that truth is real?
*"Within it, there is veracity"*—
to illuminate the principle’s authenticity,
to save all beings,
to establish methods and teachings,
from end to beginning,
examining the causes of good and evil—
from ancient times to the present,
judging deeds of depravity and rectitude—
the loyal and filial are rewarded with rank,
the treacherous and regicidal are punished with law.
It encompasses both emptiness and substance,
pervading the cosmos.
Its form is independent and ever-present,
its name serene and unceasing.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Time has both ancient and modern eras,
yet the Dao has neither origin nor end.
Since its name does not fade,
it sufficiently demonstrates its non-origin.
The text is concise for brevity’s sake.

*"To observe all origins"*—
**Imperial Commentary:**
*Observe* means *to measure and discern*.

「**甫**—the primal origin.

Speaking of the Dao’s application,
to measure and discern all things from their primal origin,
each fulfilling its innate function of growth and transformation.

**○ Master He Shang said:**
*Observe* (阅) means *to receive* (禀).
**甫**—the origin.
Speaking of all things’ birth,
they arise from the Dao receiving *qi* (气).

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Observe* (阅) means *to survey* (览).
**甫**—the origin.
Though the supreme Dao has neither origin nor end,
it is also ever-present in coming and going,
thus able to survey antiquity and discern the present,
to encompass both end and beginning.
How do I know that all things arise this way?
By this.

**○ Imperial Commentary:**
By this, one knows all things receive the Dao,
and through its wondrous functions, they transform and manifest.

**○ Imperial Commentary (on the *Zhuangzi*):**
Further elaborating on the passage:
How do I know that all things’ primal origins
receive and draw from the Dao,
that the Dao must measure and discern them,
to fulfill their growth and transformation?
The answer is:
This is because the Dao is supremely refined and trustworthy—
all things today receive its wondrous functions and thus manifest,
so one knows it this way.

**○ Master He Shang said:**
How do I know that all things arise this way?
How do I know that the Dao receives *qi* (气)?
By this.
This—*the present* (今).
With the present’s refinement,
all things obtain the Dao’s refined *qi*,
and thus they arise.
Human actions and movements,
without the Dao, would not be so.

**○ Master Rong said:**
How do I know the great Dao from ancient times to the present,
from beginning to end,
surveying all things,
distinguishing among people,
freeing the Fourfold Birth (四生),
and preserving the Three Dynasties (三代)?
Only by observing it in the seen and now,
can one know of the past and future.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
This is a rhetorical question.
The Sage Laozi says:
I know of beginning and end,
by relying on this true and pure Dao,
the vague and obscure laws (法).
Thus, I know it.

**曲则全**—*Bending yields completeness.*
This chapter follows the previous one,
for the earlier chapter only partially presented
Confucius’ *virtue/power* (德) and bearing,
so this chapter continues,
reiterating Confucius’ conduct,
able to serve as a model for all things,
and establishing four distinct divisions.

**First:** Demonstrating the Four Conducts of the Root (因地四行),
to show his humility and harmony.
**Second:** Illuminating the One Mature Essence (妙体一中),
as the standard for all things.
**Third:** Displaying the Four Virtues of the Fruit (果上四德),
to contrast with the earlier conducts.
**Fourth:** Citing ancient precedents,
to resolve doubts and complete the chapter.

**First:** Demonstrating the Four Conducts of the Root (因地四行),
to show his humility and harmony.

The great *form* (象) takes the cosmos as its furnace,
the Sage takes *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power* (德) as foundation.
All things, vast as clouds,
are contained within a grain of millet.
The Four Great Elements (四大) soar high,
yet are borne upon the Lion’s peak (师子之上).

*Bending* (曲) and *completeness* (全) are spoken of—
comparing the Sage to the *Lingma* (列麻),
the wind and strings (风琴) move sound,
summoning all spirits to the *Yan Tree* (骞树).
With compassion, he pardons all things;
with *law* (法), he nurtures all life.
His conduct is profound,
his merit of non-reproach is ever-present.
If one practices it,
like the Prince of Jin ascending the clouds,
it is not beyond human reach.
If one embraces it,
like Li Shaojun serving the Han,
those who hold to the One (抱一) will be guided by the Dao,
and their completion will be true.
*Bending yields completeness*—
is this not an honest claim?

**曲则全**—*Bending yields completeness.*
**○ Imperial Commentary:**
Bending oneself to fulfill duties,
then one attains completeness.

**○ Imperial Commentary (on the *Zhuangzi*):**
*Bending* (曲)—to yield and comply.
Speaking of how one can preserve oneself
by yielding to all things without contradiction,
thus attaining completeness of life.
Hence, it is said: *Bending yields completeness.*

**○ Master He Shang said:**
Bending oneself to follow the multitude,
not clinging to self,
then one attains completeness.

**○ Master Yan said:**
Even if a sovereign is Sage-like,
he must still practice *bending*—
delegating to officials while governing,
his *virtue/power* (德) thus attains completeness.

**○ Master Rong said:**
*Bending yields completeness,*
*crookedness yields uprightness,*
*hollow yields fullness,*
*worn-out yields renewal,*
*simplicity yields attainment,*
*excess yields confusion.*
Externally yielding to all things,
internally nourishing the spirit,
harmony between self and all—
this is completeness.
Bow to others, yet do not lose the Dao—
this is uprightness.
Retreat in humility, dwelling low—
this is *hollow*.
Pure yet not turbid—
this is *renewal*.
The root is inherently One,
thus it is said: *simplicity*.
Forgotten words align with the Dao,
thus it is said: *attainment*.
The myriad forms of existence,
the myriad teachings and doctrines—
thus it is said: *excess*.
Chasing desires brings confusion,
obstructed teachings bring delusion—
thus it is said: *confusion*.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Bending and yielding to follow,
not opposing the natural inclinations of things,
gentle and yielding in humility,
preserving life and nurturing the Dao—
thus the *Zhuangzi* says:
*"My path bends and yields,
yet it does not harm my feet."*
This sentence forgets the yielding to harmony.

---
**枉则直**—*Crookedness yields uprightness.*
**○ Imperial Commentary:**
To endure crookedness for the sake of others,
then one attains uprightness.

**○ Imperial Commentary (on the *Zhuangzi*):**
*Crookedness*—to endure wrongs from others.
*Uprightness*—to correct what is crooked.
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋) say:
*"To straighten the crooked is uprightness."*
Though one does not oppose things,
if others come with wrongs,
and one can endure their crookedness,
they will be shamed and rectify themselves—
then one’s uprightness corrects their crookedness.
Hence, it is said: *crookedness*.

**○ Master He Shang said:**
To endure wrongs for others’ sake,
in time, one attains uprightness.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Crookedness*—to endure defamation.
The body knows no distinction between crookedness and uprightness,
thus able to receive slander
without retaliating in wrongful reproach,
but instead to uphold the Dao’s rectitude.
This sentence forgets the defamation and praise.

---
**洼则盈**—*Hollow yields fullness.*
**○ Imperial Commentary:**
To uphold humble *virtue/power* (德),
then one attains fullness.

**○ Imperial Commentary (on the *Zhuangzi*):**
*Hollow*—to aid what is low.
*Fullness*—to be satisfied.
This is a metaphorical explanation.
If the earth is low and yielding,
water flows and fills it.
If one steadfastly upholds humility,
*virtue/power* (德) becomes boundless.
To be able to bend and endure wrongs—
this is *hollow*.
To attain completeness and uprightness—
this is *fullness*.
Hence, it is said: *Hollow yields fullness.*

**○ Master He Shang said:**
The earth is low and yielding,
water flows into it.
Humans are low and yielding,
*virtue/power* (德) returns to them.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Hollow*—to be low.
Humility, meekness, and yielding—
retiring oneself to a low place,
not competing with things for height—
thus one’s conduct and *virtue/power* (德) become full and complete.
This sentence forgets the high and low.

---
**弊则新**—*Worn-out yields renewal.*

「To bend, to be low, and to endure wrongs—
all are ways of placing oneself in *privation/deficiency* (弊).
To place oneself in privation,
others will exalt you first,
and thus your *virtue/power* (德) is renewed daily—
hence, it is said: *Worn-out yields renewal.*

**○ Master He Shang said:**
To accept privation oneself,
to place others before self—
the world respects this.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Privation* (弊) is *humiliation*.
To endure *humiliation, ignominy, and privation* (鄙恶弊辱),
yet not covet *honor and favor* (荣宠),
this is how one’s *virtue/power* (德) is renewed—
this sentence forgets *honor and humiliation* (荣辱).

**Secondly, it illustrates the *Mystic Body* (妙体) of unity,
serving as a *model/pattern* (楷式) for all things.**
*Then one attains* (则得).
**御注:** To embrace the *One* (一) without departing from it—
this is how one avoids *loss* (失).

**○御疏:** *Fewness attains* (少则得),
*excess leads to confusion* (多则惑).
Thus, the *Sage* (圣人) embraces the *One* (一) as the *model/pattern* (式) for all under heaven.
*Fewness*—to take from oneself—
this is how one avoids *loss* (失),
hence it is said: *attains*.
*Excess*—to rely on oneself—
others will surely dispute,
hence it is said: *confusion*.
When refining one’s person, it is the same;
when cultivating the *Dao/Way* (道), likewise—
one must embrace and guard the *pure, unadulterated One* (淳一),
to preserve one’s *true, original nature* (真素).

If one seeks to broadly pursue *heterodox paths* (异门),
this will invite *chaos and confusion* (乱惑).
Hence, the *lost sheep* (亡羊) perishes at the *crossroads* (叉因於歧路),
and the *life lost* (丧生) occurs through *many directions* (谅在於多方).

Thus, the *Sage* embraces the *One* without departing,
and can serve as the *law/standard* (法式) for all under heaven.
*Pattern* (式) is *law* (法).

**○ Master He Shang said:**
*Fewness*—to accept privation—
this is how one attains *excess*.
The *Heavenly Way* (天道) aids the *humble*,
and the *Divine Light* (神明) entrusts itself to the *empty/virtuous* (虚).

**○ Master Yan said:**
*Fewness*—to restrict oneself—
though one remains in fewness,
all things will naturally attain their proper place.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Fewness attains* (少则得),
*excess leads to confusion* (多则惑).
*Fewness*—referring to the *conduct of bending, being low, and complete* (曲全等行),
unaware of high or low,
dwelling in the *One* (一中).
*Excess*—to be entangled in *obedience and disobedience* (违顺等法),
not departing from the *two extremes* (二偏).
To dwell in the *One* (一中) is to be entangled by the *two extremes* (二偏),
hence *confusion* (迷惑).
*Excess leads to confusion* (多则惑).

**○御注:** To engage in *many doctrines* (有为多门)
is to invite *confusion and chaos* (惑乱).

**○ Master He Shang said:**
Those with *many possessions* (财多者) are confused by guarding their person,
those with *much learning* (学多者) are confused by what they hear.

**○ Master Yan said:**
To trust oneself and indulge in thought,
not to rely on others,
yet to speak and know much—
this leads to *madness and chaos* (狂乱).

Thus, the *Sage* embraces the *One* as the *model/pattern* (式) for all under heaven.
**御注:** The *Sage* embraces and guards the *pure, unadulterated One* (淳一),
and thus can serve as the *law/standard* (法式) for all under heaven.

**○ Master He Shang said:**
*Embrace* (抱) is *guard* (守).
*Pattern* (式) is *law* (法).
The *Sage* guards the *One* (一), completing all affairs,
and thus can serve as the *law/standard* (法式) for all under heaven.

**○ Master Rong said:**
*The One* (一) is the *Dao/Way* (道).
The *Sage* cherishes the *Dao/Way* (道),
hence it is said: *embrace the One*.
All actions align with *principle* (理),
capable of guiding all things,
hence it is said: *pattern*.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Thus* (是以) follows the previous statement.
*Embrace* (抱) is *to uphold and cherish* (守持).
*Pattern* (式) is *law/standard* (法则).
It speaks of how the *Sage* upholds this *One* (一) within the *Dao/Way*,
as a guiding model for all beings,
and thus serves as the *paragon of cultivation* (修学之楷模) for all under heaven.

**Thirdly, it reveals the *fruits* (果) of the four *virtues/powers* (德) above,
contrasting with the *prior conduct* (前行).**

**Not to reveal oneself—this is how clarity is attained.**
**御注:** If one does not reveal their own *virtue/power* (德),
constantly bending oneself to respond to duties,
then their *virtue/power* (德) will naturally be fully illuminated.

**○御疏:** This reverses the explanation of *bending yields completeness* (曲则全).
It says that if one does not reveal their own *beauty* (美),
yet *surrenders and obeys* (委顺) to all things,
then their *complete virtue/power* (全德) will daily grow more manifest—
hence, it is said: *thus clarity is attained*.

**○ Master He Shang said:**
The *Sage* does not use their own eyes to see beyond a thousand miles,
but relies on the eyes of all under heaven to see—
thus they can illuminate the distant.

**○ Master Yan said:**
The *Sage* does not boast of their own clarity,
but lets the eyes of all under heaven see all under heaven—
thus, *Li Lou* (离娄) could not equal their clarity.

**○ Master Rong said:**
Not to reveal oneself—thus clarity is attained.
Not to insist on one’s own views—thus *illumination* (彰) is achieved.
Not to claim one’s own merits—thus there are *achievements* (功).
Not to boast—thus one endures.
To abandon distinctions and relinquish knowledge,
*wisdom* (智慧) naturally illuminates.
To diminish the *other* (物) and *self* (我) to preserve the *true* (真),
*virtue/power and Dao/Way* (道德) naturally become manifest.
To take merit as one’s own—thus one loses it.
To exaggerate one’s own *virtue/power* (德)—thus it does not endure.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary says:**
*Other* and *self* are both *empty* (空).
Not to see the *form of one’s own body* (我身相),
thus *wisdom* (智慧) shines brightly.

**Not to insist on one’s own views—thus *illumination* (彰) is achieved.**
**御注:** If one does not insist on their own correctness,
yet bends oneself to extend others,
then their *correctness* (是) will naturally become manifest.

**○御疏:** This reverses the explanation of *bending yields uprightness* (枉则直).
It says that if one can endure wrongs for others,
not to assert or claim correctness for oneself,
there will be no blame.
Thus their *uprightness* (直) will naturally become manifest—
hence, it is said: *thus illumination is achieved*.

**○ Master He Shang said:**
The *Sage* does not insist on their own correctness,
nor condemn others—
thus they can illuminate the world.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Self* and *other* are equal.
Not to assert or deny *self* or *other*—
thus their *virtue/power* (德) becomes manifest.

**Not to claim one’s own merits—thus there are *achievements* (功).**
**御注:** If one does not claim or take their own merits,
then their *achievements* (功) will return to them.

**○御疏:** This reverses the explanation of *bending yields completeness* (洼则盈).
It says that if one does not claim or take their own merits,
constantly practicing *humility and yielding* (谦让),
then others will not compete,
and their *achievements* (功) will return to them.
Like the earth being *strong yet low* (劲下),
water will surely *fill and overflow* (盈).
Hence, it is said: *there are achievements*.

**○ Master He Shang said:**
*Claim* (伐) is *take* (取).
The *Sage*’s *virtue/power and transformation* (德化) flow and spread,
yet does not take their own beauty—
thus they have *achievements* (功) for all under heaven.

**○ Master Yan said:**
*Claim* (伐) is like *attacking and seizing* (攻伐).
To use the *anger of all under heaven* to attack all under heaven—
thus, *Huangdi* (黄帝) could not equal their *威* (威).
To use the *strength of all under heaven* to wage war against all under heaven—
thus, *Tang* and *Wu* (汤武) could not equal their *achievements* (量功).
Hence, all under heaven can be entrusted to,
and the *feudal lords* (诸侯) can be subjects after them.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Claim* (伐) is *take* (取).
Though they *punish and harm* (亭毒) countless beings,
yet they *sacrifice themselves as mere straw dogs* (刍狗) to the people,
pushing merit onto others—
thus they have *great achievements* (大功).

**Not to boast—thus one endures.**
**御注:** If one can constantly guard *privation/deficiency* (弊薄),
not boasting or exalting oneself,
then others will exalt their *enduring qualities* (长).

**○御疏:** This reverses the explanation of *bending yields renewal* (曲则新).
It says that if one can guard *privation/deficiency* (弊薄),
not boasting or showing off,
then others will surely yield,
and their *good conduct* (善行) will grow ever longer—
hence, it is said: *thus one endures*.

**○ Master He Shang said:**
*Boast* (矜) is *great* (大).

The Sage does not claim greatness for himself,
thus able to endure long without danger.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
It is because they push *virtue/power* (德) and *good conduct* (行) onto others,
so they do not boast or exalt themselves—
thus their *virtue/power* (德) and *conduct* (行) are enduring and far-reaching.

**Only because they do not contend,**
thus none under Heaven can contend with them.

**御注:** If one does not contend with others,
who will contend with them?

**○御疏:** Only those who practice *bending yields renewal* (曲则新),
*yielding to preserve wholeness* (全), and similar *Dao/Way* (道),
all embody *humility and compliance* (委顺), not contending.
Since *gentleness and weakness* (柔弱) surpass *rigidity and strength* (刚强),
and *modesty and emptiness* (谦虚) naturally return to *uprightness* (直),
then who under Heaven could contend with those who do not contend?
Hence, it is said: *none can contend with them*.

**○ Master He Shang said:**
This speaks of the Sage’s ability to not monopolize *truth* (是),
while the ancients spoke of *crookedness and uprightness* (枉正) being rare—
not empty words, but true accounts of *wholeness and preservation* (全理).
Those who can *yield and comply* (曲从) truly preserve their *form and body* (肌体),
returning it to their *parents* (父母),
and suffer no harm.

**○ Master Yan said:**
The shadow follows the form,
the echo answers the sound—
if one does not contend with others,
who will contend with them?

**○ Master Rong said:**
To assert oneself as right
and point at others as wrong,
to not harmonize with people
but only to oppose others—
this is the origin of contention.
The Sage *bends and yields* (屈曲), following others,
*forgiving wrongs and righting injustices* (豁荡是非),
not contending for *merit and fame* (功名),
and does not compete with others—
thus, though Heaven is vast,
who could contend with them?

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
This is the praise of those who embody the *Four Virtues* (四德),
profoundly understanding *conformity and opposition* (违顺),
using *modesty* (谦) to nurture themselves,
not contending with others—
thus all beings under Heaven cannot contend with those who do not contend.
The fourth section draws upon ancient truths
to conclude the praise of *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲全).

The ancients spoke of *bending yields renewal* (曲则全)—
was this not true?
Indeed, it is true and returns to oneself.

**御注:** The ancients’ words on *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲全)—
were these not true?
Those who truly *yield and comply* (曲) will surely *preserve wholeness* (全).
This is the *principle* (理) returning to itself.

**○御疏:** This passage cites ancient words
to conclude the theme of *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲全).
It states that from ancient times there were these words on *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲全)—
were these not true words with real meaning?
If one can *yield and comply* (曲顺), not opposing others,
then they truly possess *wholeness* (全理),
returning it to themselves—
hence, it is said: *Indeed, it is true and returns to oneself*.
*Sincerity* (诚) means *truth* (信).

**○ Master He Shang said:**
The ancients spoke of *bending yields renewal* (曲则全)—
was this not true?
The *transmission* (传) of ancient words
on *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲从则全身)
and *uprightness* (正) is not empty or false.
*Indeed, it is true and returns to oneself*—
this means they truly possess *wholeness* (全).
Those who can *yield and comply* (曲从)
truly preserve their *form and body* (肌体),
returning it to their *parents* (父母),
and suffer no harm.

**○ Master Rong said:**
The Sage does not monopolize *truth* (是).
This refers to the ancient practice of *crookedness and uprightness* (枉正) being rare—
not empty words, but true accounts of *wholeness and preservation* (全理).

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
The ancients spoke of *yielding and compliance* (屈曲柔顺)
to preserve their *Dao/Way* (道)—
this is not empty talk,
but truly the words of instruction.
If one follows the teachings and practices *modesty*,
not contending with others,
then they achieve *great and whole virtue* (大成全德),
all returning to themselves.

**Chapter 23: Hope in Spontaneity (希言自然)**
This chapter follows the previous one
because the prior chapter expounded the *Four Virtues* (四德) of *yielding to preserve wholeness* (曲全),
while this chapter speaks of *depending on practice* (依修).
Thus, it follows to further clarify all *conducts* (行).

Within this chapter, there are four layers of meaning:
1. It clarifies the *teaching of the body* (体教) to *forget words* (忘言),
   thus able to grasp *principle* (理).
2. It clarifies the *restless and competitive mind* (执心躁竞),
   which is why one lacks constancy.
3. It concludes the attainment of *forgetting words* (忘言之得).
4. It directly concludes the loss of *holding to teachings* (执教之失).

**1. Clarifying the *teaching of the body* (体教) to *forget words* (忘言), thus able to grasp *principle* (理).**
Water, with its *gentleness and weakness* (柔弱),
breaks *rigidity and strength* (坚).
*Virtue/power* (德), with its *compassion and mercy* (慈悲),
leads to *broadness* (广).
Heaven speaks not—
the four seasons move alone,
governed by *Spontaneity* (修).
All things find their nature in it.
When the *fickle wind* (飘风) is about to arise,
the *Mysterious Transformation* (玄化) governs it in the *vast blue* (苍苍).
When the *sudden rain* (骤雨) pours down,
the *Bright Day* (白日) restrains it in the *radiant white* (皎皎).

Heaven cannot long *emit and disperse* (发泄),
Earth cannot long *flicker and surge* (飘腾),
thus the *Two Polarities* (二仪) endure forever,
and the people *harmonize* (折中).
How could they allow the *common beings* (凡物) to indulge in *wildness and carelessness* (肆狂疏)?

The *Boastful Father* (夸父) drank the river’s water and perished,
the *Duke of Zhou* (共公) touched the Zhou Mountains and hanged himself—
these are the *ultimate reckless deeds* (卒暴之行),
which the *Venerable Lord* (老君) warned against.
This is *Hope in Spontaneity* (希言自然).

**御注:** *Hope in Spontaneity* (希言) is *forgetting words* (忘言).
Though it says *forgetting words* (忘言), it uses *hope* (希) instead,
to show that *Dao/Way* (道) is verified through words,
and not entirely forgotten.
Once one *awakens to the Dao* (悟道), words are forgotten—
hence, it is said: *Hope in Spontaneity* (希尔).
If one can *awaken to the Dao* (悟道) through words,
not clinging to words,
then they align with *Spontaneity* (自然).

**○御疏:** This passage clarifies that teachings cannot be rigidly clung to.
*Hoping in Spontaneity* (希言) is *forgetting words* (忘言).
Words exist in *principle* (理).
Clinging to words is not the way of one who truly *awakens to the teachings* (悟教).
*Principle* (理) is not attained by entirely forgetting words;
forgetting words entirely means losing the gradual path to *awakening* (求悟之渐).
Thus, it is clear that *principle* (理) is expounded through words,
and words cannot be entirely forgotten.
Once one *awakens to principle* (悟理), words are forgotten—
hence, it is said: *Hope in Spontaneity* (希尔).
If one can *awaken to the subtle truths* (悟证精微) through words,
not clinging to superficial teachings,
then they align with *Spontaneity* (自然).

Hence, it is said: *Hope in Spontaneity* (希言自然).

**○ Master He Shang said:**
*Hoping in words* (希言) means *loving words* (爱言).
Loving words is the *Dao/Way of Spontaneity* (自然之道).

**○ Master Rong said:**
*Hoping* (希) means *few* (少).
Many words exhaust *truth* (穷),
few words align with *Dao/Way* (道)—
hence, it is said: *Spontaneity* (自然).
*Dao/Way* (道) is neither *emptiness* (空) nor *being* (有),
*principle* (理) is neither *few* (少) nor *many* (多).
To clarify that many words lose *truth* (真),
few words align with *Dao/Way* (道).

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Hoping* (希) means *simplifying and reducing* (简少).
*Hoping in words* (希言) is akin to *forgetting words* (忘言).
*Spontaneity* (自然) is the *ultimate Dao/Way of the Recondite Mysteries* (重玄之极道).
The song reveals the *supreme path* (至道) beyond *blindness* (盲),
stating that words *deviate* (乖) from *principle* (理).
Only by *forgetting words and abandoning teachings* (忘言遣教)
can one *naturally resonate* (适可契会) with the *Mysterious and Profound* (虚玄).

**2. Clarifying the *restless and competitive mind* (执心躁竞), which is why one lacks constancy.**
The *fickle wind* (飘风) does not last the morning,
the *sudden rain* (骤雨) does not last the day.

**御注:** When the wind and rain are *fickle and sudden* (飘骤),
they *covet* (慕) the *ultimate recklessness* (卒),
harming things.
If one *clings to words and teachings* (执言滞教),
they *lose the Dao* (失道) and *fall into delusion* (生迷).

**○御疏:** *Fickle wind* (飘风) refers to *wild and swift wind* (狂疾之风).
*Sudden rain* (骤雨) refers to *violent and urgent rain* (暴急之雨).
Wind is meant to *scatter* (散) things,
rain is meant to *nourish* (润) things.
If they are *wild, swift, violent, or urgent*,
they harm things and do not last long—
thus, it is said.
By analogy, words and teachings are meant to *expound principle* (诠理),
but if one *clings to words and teachings* (执言滞教),
there is no way to *awaken and comprehend* (悟了),
thus they *lose the Dao* (失道) and *fall into delusion* (生迷).

Thus, wind and rain must not be fickle and sudden,
nor must words and teachings be clung to and obstructed.
To illuminate the Dao by forgetting words is to align with Nature—
hence the analogy of fickle rain.

○ Master He Shang said:
*"Fickle wind"* is swift wind,
*"sudden rain"* is violent rain.
Swift wind cannot endure long,
violent rain cannot last.

○ Rong said:
Even swift winds and violent rains do not last through the day or morning,
yet those who are lighthearted, restless, and verbose—
how could they preserve their bodies and avoid harm?
Few words in accord with principle bring ten days of rain and five days of wind.
Many words bring damage—
then there are raging winds and violent rains.

○ Cheng’s Commentary:
Fickle and swift winds, sudden and violent rains,
do not even last a morning—
how could they endure a full day?
By analogy, those who cling to words and teachings,
fixated on doctrine, generate delusion.
They act rashly and recklessly, seeking swift reward,
yet this contradicts ultimate truth—
it cannot endure long.
Thus, the comparison to fickle wind and sudden rain.

The day is the summation of mornings,
the morning is a division of the day.
The division speaks to the ever-renewing moment,
the summation speaks to the span of a hundred years’ life—
all are impermanent.

Who brings this about?
The heavens and the earth.

Even the heavens and earth cannot endure long—
how much less can mortals?

**御 Commentary:**
The heavens and earth, though vast, when they rage violently, harm all things and cannot endure long. How much less can mortals, clinging to words and teachings, harm the Dao and recklessly seek sudden enlightenment? Could they ever attain it?

**御 Citation:**
*Who* brings about these fickle winds and sudden rains?
The heavens and earth.

The heavens and earth, though most divine, when they combine to produce raging winds and violent rains, cannot even last from morning to evening—how much less can mortals, in their reckless haste, endure?

**Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Who* brings about this wind and rain?
It is the dual forces of heaven and earth, with their mighty creative power. Even their raging winds and sudden rains cannot endure long—how much less can mortals, in their reckless actions, hope to last?

**Third Section:** Those who cultivate the Dao must not cling to words.

**御 Commentary:**
Thus, those who follow the Dao must not cling to fixed words and teachings.

**御 Citation:**
*From* (顺) means to follow in harmony. The Dao is boundless and unfettered in its operation—when it acts upon things, it flows without obstruction. Therefore, those who would embody its mystery and follow its way must not cling to anything; hence, it is said: *those who follow the Dao.*

**River Above Master (河上公):**
*From* (为) means to act. Mortals should act in accordance with the Dao’s stillness, not like raging winds and sudden rains.

**Rong’s Commentary (荣曰):**
The Dao is pure, effortless, and beneficent—if all actions align with the Dao, the Dao is thereby realized.

**Cheng’s Commentary:**
*From* means to follow in accordance with. *Things* refers to worldly affairs. It speaks of those of supreme virtue, who in all actions align with principle, who in all things embody the Dao. Thus, they follow worldly affairs while remaining ever empty and responsive—this is the meaning of "the sage follows only the Dao."

Those who attain the Dao do so by aligning with principle in all things, thus merging with the Dao and its wisdom. To attain the Dao is to be one with the Dao.

Those who embody the Dao are one with the Dao,
Those who embody virtue are one with virtue.

**御 Commentary:**
Those who embody the Dao forget words and awaken to it—thus, they are one with the Dao.

**御 Citation:**
Those who follow the Dao in their actions do not become fixed; they transcend words and teachings, unencumbered, and thus are one with the Dao.

**River Above Master (河上公):**
Those who embody the Dao are those who love the Dao. To be one with the Dao is to be as the Dao itself.

**Rong’s Commentary (荣曰):**
Virtue nourishes all things and benefits humanity—if mortals act in accord with virtue, virtue is thereby realized.

**Cheng’s Commentary:**
The Dao is the eternal Way; virtue is the highest virtue. Those who embody teaching and forget words, whose actions align with supreme virtue, naturally resonate with it.

The Dao is the essence of virtue; virtue is the manifestation of the Dao. Speaking of essence, we say the Dao; speaking of manifestation, we say virtue—hence the two phrases.

**Fourth Section:** Those who cling to teaching fall into error.

**御 Commentary:**
Clinging to words and fixed teachings, they cannot awaken—unawakened, they stray from the Dao, thus becoming one with error.

**御 Citation:**
*Error* means to lose. Those who cling to words and teachings lose the Dao. Words and teachings are like the tracks of fish and rabbits—those who fixate on the tracks lose sight of the animals themselves. Those who cling to words and teachings lose the subtle truth.

To lose the subtle truth is to have no path to the Dao—thus, they are one with error.

**River Above Master (河上公):**
*Error* means to fail oneself and others. To be one with error is to align with failure.

**Rong’s Commentary (荣曰):**
Unable to act in accord with the Dao and virtue, to preserve benevolence and righteousness while associating with the wicked—this is to share in the guilt of the condemned.

**Cheng’s Commentary:**
Reckless competition, clinging to teaching, and generating delusion—when they act, they align with those who lose the way, unable to empty their hearts and merge in darkness. Those who speak of the Dao yet lose it are like those who lose the Dao itself.

As the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:
*"In past lives, they did not study—now they only lose further."*

Those who are one with the Dao, the Dao attains them.
Those who are one with virtue, virtue attains them.
Those who are one with error, error attains them.

**御 Commentary:**
Compare it to holding water—it will flow where it is poured.
Or to a concave mirror drawing fire—it follows its nature.
Things of the same kind gather; distinctions are clear—
the outcome is evident.

**御 Citation:**
This illustrates that like qi attracts like responses—
thus, the tiger’s roar summons the wind, the crane’s cry brings its mate.

Differences in nature produce the bitter and the sweet of Chu and Yue,
but harmony in the Dao unites the barbarian and the civilized under one wind.

Things follow their kind without resistance—
thus, those who align with the Dao draw the Dao’s response,
and those who align with error invite error’s arrival.

「Just as one holds water to let it flow where it is poured,
or uses a concave mirror to draw fire—
the fire comes naturally.

Thus it is said: Those who align with the Dao, the Dao attains them.
**Master He Shang** said:
Those who align with the Dao, the Dao attains them—
those who harmonize with the Dao, the Dao joyfully attains them.
Those who align with virtue, virtue attains them—
those who harmonize with virtue, virtue joyfully attains them.
Those who align with error, error attains them—
those who harmonize with error, error joyfully attains them.

**Yan** said:
When affairs follow the Dao, the Dao follows affairs.
When affairs follow virtue, virtue follows affairs.
When affairs follow error, error follows affairs.
When faith is insufficient, there arises doubt.

**御 Commentary:**
Clinging to words and being obstructed by teachings,
one cannot awaken to true understanding—
this is the insufficiency of faith.
If one aligns with error, error joyfully comes—
this is the presence of doubt.

**御 Citation:**
It speaks of why people cannot embody and verify the truth,
forgetting words in the process—
when faith and understanding are insufficient, confusion and obstruction arise.
Once confusion and obstruction arise,
one clings to words and seeks understanding.
Clinging to words to seek understanding,
one only creates further bewilderment and stumbling—
this is the presence of doubt’s response.
Thus it is said: *There arises doubt.*

**Master He Shang** said:
When faith is insufficient, the ruler lacks faith in his subjects.
When there arises doubt, the subjects respond with doubt to the ruler.
This illustrates how things of the same kind gather,
and voices of the same kind resonate—
clouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger,
water flows to the damp, fire turns to the dry.

**Yan** said:
Insufficient faith refers to the self;
doubt arises refers to both humankind and the cosmos.

**Rong** said:
Those who align with the Dao, the Dao attains them—
when one has faith in the Dao, the Dao attains that person.
Those who align with error, the Dao abandons them—
when faith is insufficient, doubt arises.

**Cheng’s Citation:**
Unable to forget words,
yet clinging to words to seek truth—
though one claims to have faith in the Dao,
one’s understanding is still insufficient,
and thus one clings obstinately to teachings and doctrines,
failing to reach the true source.
This is the heart of doubt.

Therefore, in the realm of Supreme Mystery,
there are those who **stand on tiptoe**—
*Chapter Twenty-Four: The Chapter of Those Who Stand on Tiptoe,*
explaining why this chapter follows the last—
the last chapter criticized the restless and competitive,
those who clung to erroneous teachings,
so this chapter further clarifies its meaning.
Within this chapter alone,
there are three distinct teachings:
First, it illustrates the two confusions of **tiptoeing and striding**,
closely following the chapter on sudden rains;
Second, it reiterates the four bewilderments,
contrasting with the four virtues of *curved fullness* and *complete harmony*;
Third, it uses analogies to encourage one to abandon such tendencies.

**First: Illustrating the two confusions of tiptoeing and striding, closely following the chapter on sudden rains.**
Within the Three Realms,
only the sages who adhere to the **Mysterious Origin** are revered.
Within the Eightfold Heaven,
all honor the **authentic teachings of Huang-Lao**.
They humble themselves and yield gently,
neither tiptoeing nor striding,
borrowing the **mother-qi** to give birth to things,
and presenting the **father of learning** to teach the ignorant.
Their **effortless effort** is grand and pure,
their **clear brightness** is pristine and white—
like a well that never runs dry,
or the boundless sky above.
Gazing upward, it only grows higher—
how can it compare to the vast blue?
In **nirvana**, they remain unstained,
congealing the **pure emptiness** beyond thought,
yet in the world of dust, they can blend harmoniously,
dwelling in the **sand realm** while ever serene.

They lament the **pride in excess** like leftover food,
and sigh at the **flaunting of clarity** like superfluous adornments.
Steadfast and unmoving,
their **purple qi** radiates from the **West Pass**,
tranquil and effortless,
their **white light** is heard in the **Southern Calendar**.

To know their subtlety,
this is what is meant.

Those who **stand on tiptoe** cannot endure,
those who **stride arrogantly** cannot proceed.

**御 Commentary:**
**Standing on tiptoe** means lifting one’s heels to gaze afar.
**Striding** means clinging to things to surpass others.
What analogy better illustrates
those who vainly seek enlightenment—
their clarity never obtained—
than the one who stands on tiptoe, unable to endure long,
or strides, yet cannot move forward?
For **tiptoeing** makes one unstable,
and **striding** obstructs one’s path—
just as in the following lines,
*self-perception leads to blindness*,
*self-righteousness obscures truth*.

Thus it is clear:
**Tiptoeing** cannot endure,
**striding** cannot proceed,
**self-perception** cannot bring clarity,
**self-righteousness** cannot reveal truth.

**Master He Shang** said:
Those who **tiptoe** cannot endure—
**tiptoeing** means advancing.
It refers to those who covet power and fame,
pursuing功名 (*official status and glory*)—
such advancement cannot last in body or Dao.

Those who **stride arrogantly** cannot proceed—
they consider themselves noble,
yet **stride over others**,
and the crowd scorns them,
preventing their progress.

**Rong** said:
**Striding** means surpassing.
Slow and measured steps endure long,
but **tiptoeing and striding** over others—
such progress cannot last.
This illustrates that those who practice humility, modesty, and yielding
can endure and flourish,
while those who **tiptoe and stride in pride**
invite their own ruin.

**Cheng’s Citation:**
Those who **tiptoe** cannot endure long—
**tiptoeing** means coveting and emulating.
The restless and competitive,
their hearts not harboring the Dao,
cannot uphold authenticity or preserve simplicity,
yet they covet external desires.
But things have their inherent nature,
and such desires cannot be attained by **tiptoeing**.
Having abandoned their Dao,
how can they endure long?

Those who **stride arrogantly** cannot proceed—
**striding** means prideful arrogance.
Practitioners of the Dao must be humble and modest,
yet if they **stride over others in pride**,
taking this as their aspiration,
they cannot proceed on the Dao.
Thus *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The eagle and the falcon rest while the carp and the kite tire themselves out in striding,"*
and again:
*"Power and influence are short-lived,
so the boastful will weep."*

「○ *Rong* says: Those who seek self-clarity are blind,
those who insist on their own right are not illuminated,
those who boast of their own merit achieve nothing,
those who vaunt their own virtue do not endure long.
This is not the conduct of a true gentleman—
how can it be the way of one who forgets himself?

○ *Cheng*’s commentary: Unable to forget oneself,
one sees only one’s own body,
which is the mark of stupidity, not wisdom.
Those who insist on their own right are not illuminated.

○ *Yu*’s annotation: To stubbornly uphold one’s own views while rejecting others,
and to boast of one’s superiority as if seeking fame,
is to invite universal censure.
Thus, one’s virtue remains obscured,
and one cannot shine.

○ *He Shang Gong* says: When one insists on one’s own appearance as good,
and on one’s own actions as conforming to the Dao,
one fails to recognize that one’s appearance is actually ugly,
and one’s conduct is base.

○ *Rong* says: Those who boast of their own merit achieve nothing,
for they lack the virtue of humility and the practice of yielding.
If one abandons this Way,
there is no path to success—
how much more so when one arrogantly claims merit and strives for glory,
only to invite contention and squander one’s achievements?
Thus it is said: those who boast of their own merit achieve nothing.

○ *He Shang Gong* says: Those who habitually claim their own right
and constantly speak ill of others
will find their virtue obscured by all.

○ *Cheng*’s commentary: Those who vaunt their own grandeur,
overbearing and arrogant toward all,
are short-sighted and foolish—
how can their virtue endure long?

○ *Yan* says: Before the masses have stirred,
before the realm has responded,
to raise arms in war is to lose the Way of the ruler.
The Way of wielding arms is to lose the ruler’s timing—
the people’s resentment grows,
the celestial order is disturbed,
the ancestral temples face peril,
and one’s life ends with no merit.

○ *Cheng*’s commentary: Whenever one acts,
one boasts of one’s own merit,
and all things recoil in aversion—
thus one achieves no lasting glory.

○ *Rong* says: Residual leftovers are unfit for ancestral offerings,
boastful conduct is unfit for advancing the Dao.
The confused love such conduct as correct,
while the enlightened despise it as false—
thus they do not cherish it.

○ *Cheng*’s commentary: In the Dao, one speaks of residual leftovers and parasitic growths—
residual leftovers are like spoiled food,
parasitic growths are like harmful excrescences.
*Zhuangzi* says: *"Hanging warts and parasitic growths—
they protrude from the body and exceed its nature,
and all things may detest them,
so those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them."*
This refers to those who seek self-clarity and insist on their own right—
their conduct in the Dao is like spoiled food and parasitic growths,
which all things detest.
Parasitic growths are useless flesh,
boastful conduct is useless action—
all beings in the world abhor their sight.
Thus, those who cherish the Dao
would never fix their minds on such parasitic, boastful ways.

*End of Volume Six of the *Dao De Zheng Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue) – Commentary by Master *Cheng*
*Beginning of Volume Seven of the *Dao De Zheng Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue) – Compiled Commentary*」

**Chapter Twenty-Five: *The Chapter of the Undifferentiated Essence***

*This chapter follows the previous one,*
*for the prior spoke broadly of boastful pride,*
*urging one to shun such tastes.*
*Thus, this chapter is placed next,*
*revealing the true nature of the Dao,*
*to inspire beings to cultivate.*

*Teaching and prescribing methods*
*must first diagnose the ailment,*
*then offer the remedy.*
*The remedy confronts the disease—*
*this is why the chapter follows.*

*Now, this chapter unfolds in five themes:*
*First, revealing the Dao’s true nature,*
*transcending all form and sound;*
*Second, clarifying its original namelessness,*
*then establishing names through its manifestations;*
*Third, guiding beings toward its path,*
*returning them to their root and origin;*
*Fourth, citing the Four Great Elements within the realm,*
*to show beings how to align their cultivation;*
*Fifth, illustrating the shallow’s path to depth,*
*gradually ascending to the ultimate perfection.*

---

**First: Revealing the Dao’s True Nature, Transcending All Form and Sound.**

*There is an Essence that coalesces without distinction,*
*existing before Heaven and Earth arise,*
*the primordial *qi* that enfolds all things,*
*exceeding the workings of *造化* (Creation and Transformation) in its function.*
*Its essence is profound and still,*
*quiet and solitary, standing alone.*
*Though its goodness is vast,*
*we force upon it a name—*
*thus things are born,*
*and we call it *Dao/Way*.*
*At the Jade Pool’s fleeting gathering,*
*some hear the *Huangzhu* (Yellow Bamboo) hymn,*
*while in the *dongling* (caverns and peaks) others encounter*
*the scent of white *mao* (grass).*

*Its passing is distant,*
*its essence is true.*
*The Twelve Sovereigns honor the Nameless Lord,*
*and the Five Thousand Words proclaim it as the Mother of All Things.*
*The Dao of Nature—*
*what need has Heaven of speech?*

*There is an Essence that coalesces without distinction,*
*existing before Heaven and Earth arise.*
*[Emperor’s Annotation]:*
*To explain why the Dao is named,*
*it speaks of "an Essence."*
*The Essence coalesces without distinction,*
*encompassing all things.*
*Tracing its transformation,*
*one finds it precedes Heaven and Earth.*
*[Emperor’s Commentary]:*
*"An Essence" refers to the wondrous Essence,*
*the very *虚极* (Ultimate Void) and *妙本* (Profound Origin).*
*To further clarify why names are imposed,*
*yet the Dao cannot be directly called,*
*it says, "There is this wondrous Essence."*
*Coalescing without distinction,*
*it enfolds all phenomena.*
*Tracing its transformation,*
*one finds it precedes Heaven and Earth—*
*thus, it is said to exist before Heaven and Earth arise.*

*[Master He Shang Gong] said:*
*The Dao is formless, like the undifferentiated *混沌* (Chaos),*
*yet it gives birth to all things,*
*existing before Heaven and Earth.*

*[Master Li Rong] said:*
*"An Essence" is the Dao.*
*Though named *Dao/Way*,*
*the Dao as Essence*
*is but a fleeting glimpse,*
*a hazy vision—*
*it cannot be discussed in terms of presence or absence,*
*nor distinguished by yin and yang.*
*Coalescing without distinction,*
*it forms all things naturally.*
*Thus, it is called *混成* (Undifferentiated Coalescence).*
*The Dao’s natural principle*
*operates through transformation and change,*
*its formless depths*
*unfold through the *qi* of phenomena.*
*Its origin precedes Heaven and Earth—*
*thus, it is said to exist before their birth.*

*[Master Cheng’s Commentary]:*
*"An Essence" is the Dao.*
*It clarifies that the Dao, though called "having,"*
*is not truly a thing,*
*and though called "an Essence,"*
*it is not truly material.*
*Undifferentiated yet capable of giving birth to all things,*
*it is also said to be not mixed yet mixed,*
*though mixed, it coalesces,*
*though coalesced, it remains undifferentiated.*
*Though undifferentiated, it coalesces,*
*though coalesced, it remains undifferentiated—*
*this is the Dao of Undifferentiated Coalescence,*
*existing before Heaven and Earth,*
*yet neither prior nor posterior,*
*neither giving birth nor being born.*
*Thus, the *Zhuangzi* says:*
*"The Spirit Sovereign, the Ghost Sovereign,*
*give birth to Heaven and Earth,"*
*and also:*
*"It exists before Heaven and Earth,*
*yet is not called the Old One."*

*Silent and vast, it stands alone unchanging,*
*circulates endlessly without exhaustion,*
*and may be called the Mother of all things.*

*[Emperor’s Annotation]:*
*The nature of "An Essence" is silent and vast,*
*its profound origin ever still and tranquil.*
*Thus, it stands alone unchanging.*
*Its influence permeates all beings,*
*so it circulates endlessly without peril.*
*All things draw from it to be born and formed,*
*receiving its nurturing and flourishing virtue—*
*thus, it may be called the Mother of all things.*

*[Emperor’s Commentary]:*
*"Silent and vast, it stands alone unchanging,"*
*—this sighs at the nature of "An Essence,"*
*silent and vast, its profound origin ever still and tranquil,*
*thus standing alone without alteration.*
*All things respond to it inevitably,*
*yet its response is without intent,*
*permeating all beings—*
*thus, it circulates endlessly without peril.*

*"It may be called the Mother of all things,"*
*—its profound origin gives birth and transforms,*
*permeating all beings.*
*All things under Heaven*
*are none but its crafted forms,*
*and all creatures receive its flourishing nurturing virtue—*
*thus, it may rightly be called the Mother of all things.*
*The Mother’s meaning lies in its nurturing virtue.*

*[Master He Shang Gong] said:*
*"Silent and vast, it stands alone unchanging—*
*Silent means without sound,*
*Vast means formless emptiness.*
*Standing alone means without pair or equal,*
*Unchanging means transformation has constancy."*

*[Master Li Rong] said:*
*The Dao of Undifferentiated Coalescence,*
*existing before Heaven and Earth,*
*when listened to, is inaudible—*
*thus, it is silent and vast without echo.*
*When grasped, it cannot be held—*
*thus, it is formless and boundless.*
*It lacks a counterpart,*
*so it is said to stand alone.*
*Ever profound and unceasing,*
*thus, it is said to be unchanging.*
*It is nowhere absent,*
*thus, it circulates endlessly.*
*Its application is without effort,*
*thus, it is without peril.*
*It nurtures and shelters all living things—*
*this is the meaning of "Mother."*

*[Master Cheng’s Commentary]:*
*"Silent and vast, standing alone unchanging—*
*Silent means without sound,*
*Vast means formless.*
*Standing alone means without reliance on another.*
*Unchanging means without alteration or drift.*
*The Dao’s nature is deep and mysterious,*
*its form and sound utterly transcended.*
*Since it lacks dependence,*
*it neither alters nor is altered.*
*This is the meaning of*
*—**独独非待独* (Truly solitary, without reliance, truly alone).*
*The Dao is nowhere absent,*
*thus its circulation is endless.*
*Wherever it is, all is penetrated—*
*thus, it is without peril.*
*It opens yin and yang,*
*stabilizes Heaven and Earth,*
*nurtures all phenomena,*
*and nurtures sentient beings,*
*giving birth and sheltering them—*
*thus, it may be called the Mother.*

**Second: Clarifying the Original Namelessness, Then Establishing Names Through Its Manifestations.**

*I do not know its name;*
*it is called *Dao/Way*.*
*We force upon it the name *Great*.*

*[Emperor’s Annotation]:*
*I see its Essence giving birth to all things,*
*hidden without a name,*
*so I use "universal birth" to mark its virtue,*
*and call it *Dao/Way*.*
*To encompass its entirety,*
*I force upon it the name *Great*.*

*[Emperor’s Commentary]:*
*By "calling it," we mark its virtue,*
*by "naming it," we define its essence.*

The Venerable Lord Lao says:
*"The wondrous origin gives birth and transforms,*
*its boundless application knows no end,*
*silent, empty, and tranquil—*
*its form cannot be fixed.*

*It precedes Heaven and Earth in birth,*
*its lineage is beyond speech.*

*Thus, I do not know its name,*
*but seeing its boundless penetration,*
*I mark its virtue of universal birth*
*and call it **Dao/Way**.*

*Seeing it encompass all without limit,*
*I seek to define its ultimate, boundless essence,*
*and thus force upon it the name **Great**.*

*All things first receive a name, then a character,*
*for they grow from small to great.*
*But **Dao/Way** first receives a character, then a name,*
*for it descends from its origin to its traces.*

---
*The Master of the Yellow River says:*
*"I do not know its name,*
*so I call it **Dao/Way**.*
*I do not see the form of **Dao/Way**,*
*and do not know how to name it.*
*Seeing all things arise from **Dao/Way**,*
*I call it **Dao/Way**.*

*I force upon it the name **Great**—*
*unknown yet named, thus called *strong naming*.*

*Greatness is high and without surpass,*
*expansive and without boundary,*
*encompassing all without exclusion—*
*thus, it is called **Great**."*

---
*Honor says:*
*"That which has form is named,*
*that which has no likeness is transcended.*
*The name **Dao/Way** is marked by its virtue of universal birth and function,*
*encompassing all without exception—*
*thus, it is named **Great**.*

*Its principle is originally nameless,*
*yet named—*
*this is called *strong naming*."*

---
*The Commentary of Cheng says:*
*"I do not know its name,*
*so I call it **Dao/Way**.*
***Dao/Way** is originally nameless,*
*incapable of being grasped by intellect.*
*The name **Dao/Way** is as in the first chapter: *‘The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.’*

*Taking its virtue of universal birth,*
*I call it **Dao/Way**—*
*as in the first chapter: *‘The named is the Mother of all things.’*

*I force upon it the name **Great**,*
*for its body knows no bounds—*
*thus, it is called *strong naming*.*

*By naming the body and marking with the character,*
***Dao/Way** is its function,*
***Great** is its essence—*
*thus, it is named **Great** and marked **Dao/Way**.*

*All others name first, then mark,*
*but here, marking comes before naming—*
*to invert **Dao/Way** from the common.*

*Thus, different yet the same,*
*having both right and mark,*
*same yet different,*
*marking before naming."*

---
**Third: Guiding Things to Their Directions, Returning to the Root and Origin.**

*The **Great** departs,*
*The departing is distant,*
*The distant returns.*

*The Emperor’s Annotation:*
*"Its wondrous function knows no fixed direction,*
*and forced naming cannot contain it.*
*Seeking it from **Great**, it departs and goes.*
*Seeking it from its going, it is distant and unattained.*
*If one can awaken to this, then its return lies within the body and mind to be verified."*

---
*The Emperor’s Commentary:*
*"To be fixed in one direction*
*is not the ultimate penetration of the world.*

*Thus, Heaven’s role is to cover and nurture,*
*yet it cannot bear form,*
*Earth’s role is to bear form,*
*yet it cannot cover and nurture.*
*Only the wondrous origin’s function*
*has no fixed direction—*
*though named **Great**, it cannot be sustained by **Greatness**.*

*Seeking it from **Great**, it departs and goes.*
*Seeking it from its going, it is distant and unattained."*

「Seeking it from the distant,
then it returns within the human body and mind—
thus it is called *far* and *return*.

*The Zhuangzi* states:
*"The Dao/Way does not terminate at the **Great**,
nor does it neglect the **small**."*

*River Upper Master* says:
*"When called **Great**, it passes.
Its greatness is not like Heaven’s constant presence above,
nor like Earth’s constant presence below—
rather, it passes away to places without constancy.
When it passes, it is distant—
the distant extends to the boundless,
its *qi* permeating Heaven and Earth,
reaching everywhere without obstruction.
When distant, it returns—
this means its distance does not sever itself utterly,
but rather returns within the human body and mind."*

*Rong* says:
*"Passing" means "going."
If one seeks it from the **Great** but cannot attain its going,
or follows its going but cannot catch up to its distance,
then its essence is near within the body—
thus it is called *return*."*

*Master Cheng’s commentary* states:
*"When called **Great**, it passes—
passing means going.
With great power, its function can guide all beings,
leading them to the realm of the Sage.
When it passes, it is distant—
ascending beyond the Three Realms,
distant in its attainment of the Three Pure Ones.
When distant, it returns—
returning means returning.
Having perfected the Dao/Way of self-benefit,
it returns to the realm of the Sage,
mercifully rescuing all sentient beings.
Alternatively interpreted:
When lost in delusion, the Three Pure Ones are seen as the Three Realms,
but upon awakening, the Three Realms are the Three Pure Ones—
thus its return lies within the mundane dust,
which is the Great Void above.

The fourth illustration presents the Four Great Elements within the domain,
ordering things to conform to their nature.
Thus, the Dao/Way is **Great**, Heaven is **Great**, Earth is **Great**,
and the Sovereign too is **Great**.

*The Emperor’s Commentary* states:
*"By clarifying what each **Great** refers to,
one attains the unity of Heaven, Earth, and the Sovereign.
Heaven’s **Greatness** lies in its covering,
Earth’s **Greatness** lies in its bearing,
The Sovereign’s **Greatness** lies in its ability to emulate Earth and Heaven,
thus following the Dao/Way—
hence it is also called **Great**."*

*The Emperor’s Expanded Commentary* states:
*"Though the Dao/Way is named **Great** by force,
it illustrates the next **Great** things in order:
Heaven can invert the mysterious and abide above,
hanging its cover over all things;
Earth can solidify and remain below,
thickly bearing all things;
The Sovereign can maintain clarity and stillness, doing nothing,
yet transforming all things—
these are the Three **Great** ones.
My Dao/Way unifies them all."*

*River Upper Master* says:
*"The **Greatness** of the Dao/Way is that it contains all things,
encompassing all the Heavens and the Earth.
Heaven’s **Greatness** is that it covers all without exception.
Earth’s **Greatness** is that it bears all without exception.
The Sovereign’s **Greatness** is that it governs all without exception."*

*Rong* says:
*"The Dao/Way is noble and virtue/power is precious,
its net extends without limit.
Heaven can broadly cover,
without distinction between high and low;
Earth can thickly bear,
without preference for beauty or ugliness;
The Sovereign can control,
penetrating far and near,
nurturing all equally among the poor and rich—
each has its own function,
thus it is called **Great**."*

*Master Cheng’s commentary* states:
*"The Dao/Way’s **Greatness** is that it encompasses all;
Heaven’s **Greatness** is that it covers all;
Earth’s **Greatness** is that it bears all;
The Sovereign’s **Greatness** is that it governs all.
Within the domain are the Four **Great** ones,
while the Sovereign occupies one among them.

*The Emperor’s Commentary* states:
*"The Sovereign is the master of human spirit,
all things depend on his rise and fall.
To extend his warnings and admonitions,
it is said that the Sovereign resides among the Four **Great** ones—
this is to urge the Sovereign to follow the Dao/Way naturally."*

*The Emperor’s Expanded Commentary* states:
*"Domain" refers to limitation.
Now when it speaks of the **Great** within the domain,
the Dao/Way is not confined solely within the domain.
If one speaks of it in terms of what is visible,
then Heaven and Earth themselves form a domain,
yet they are not solely within the domain either.

The ancient words are used to expound profound principles,
not necessarily to force strange interpretations.
The text is preserved to prevent doubts and difficulties,
yet all interpretations fail to fully grasp it.

Now, when clarifying "domain," it is a name—
a name for a limited realm.
Things have no form beyond their names,
thus it is called *domain*.
If one speaks of the Dao/Way’s name,
then the Dao/Way is within it;
if one speaks of Heaven’s name,
then Heaven’s form is not neglected—
thus it is called *domain*.
Within the realm of names,
these Four **Great** ones are spoken of,
and the Sovereign, as the chief of human spirit,
resides among them.
With the Dao/Way, all beings receive its virtue/power;
without the Dao/Way, Heaven and Earth suffer its harm—
thus it is especially noted that the Sovereign resides among them,
to urge the Sovereign to follow the Dao/Way naturally."*

*River Upper Master* says:
*"Within the Eight Extremes there are the Four Great Elements,
and the Sovereign occupies one among them.
Yan* says: "Their functions and virtues/powers are the same."*

*Rong* says:
*"Beyond the world’s circumference,
words may cease,
but within its forms,
names should be applied.
Though the net is complete,
when examining all phenomena,
only the Four Great Elements exist.
The name **Great** being unified,
its functions are difficult to distinguish—
it exhorts the Emperor to embrace the model of Daoist virtue/power,
and take Heaven and Earth as his standard."*

*Master Cheng’s commentary* states:
*"Within the realm of phenomena,
these Four **Great** ones exist.
The Sovereign possesses the virtue/power of transformation and influence,
thus it follows the Two Principles and occupies one among them.
The Zhuangzi says:
*The Dao/Way has never been confined by boundaries*—
yet this text speaks of *domain*—
it means that though confined by domain,
the Dao/Way is not confined by domain,
and though not confined by domain,
it is confined by domain—
this is the meaning of *domain*.
Though confined by domain,
it encompasses all without limit.

The fifth illustration shows how the shallow becomes deep,
gradually ascending to the Perfect Dao/Way.

Humans follow Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao/Way,
The Dao/Way follows Nature.

*The Emperor’s Commentary* states:
*"Humans" refers to the Sovereign,
who as ruler must first follow Earth’s stillness.
Having done so, he must then follow Heaven’s movement and transformation.
Having transformed and created,
he must then follow the Dao/Way’s clarity and stillness,
doing nothing to let things transform of themselves.
If the human ruler can do this,
then he unites with the Dao/Way’s following of Nature.*

*The Emperor’s Expanded Commentary* states:
*"Humans" refers to the Sovereign,
and it is said "humans" because humans can follow Heaven and Earth’s creation,
follow the Dao/Way’s clarity and stillness,
and thus all under Heaven will turn toward him—
this is why he is called the Sovereign.
If the Sovereign does not act thus,
then things have nowhere to turn—
thus "humans" is mentioned to warn him.

As a Sovereign, he must first follow Earth’s stillness,
and from that stillness,
he must then follow Heaven’s transformation and influence,
and his virtue/power will extend to all things.
Again, he must follow the Dao/Way’s clarity and stillness,
doing nothing,
forgetting his own influence over things,
and letting them transform of themselves.
If the human ruler can do this,
then he unites with the Dao/Way’s following of Nature.
It is said that the Dao/Way’s following of Nature is not merely imitating Nature’s following of itself.

If one is confused and cannot follow the Dao/Way’s example in Nature,
then there are Five **Great** ones within the domain,
not Four.*"*

---
*Annotations:*
*Yan: Likely refers to a figure named Yan, possibly Yan Hui (顏回), a famous disciple of Confucius, or another commentator in the Daoist tradition.
*This text is from the *Taoist Canon* (道藏), specifically the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* (周易参同契), a Daoist alchemical text.

「Again, it cites the *Xisheng Jing* (《西升经》): The **Voidlessness** (虚无) gives rise to **Nature** (自然), **Nature** (自然) generates the **Dao/Way** (道), and the **Dao/Way** (道) is thus called the **Voidlessness’s** (虚无) grandchild and **Nature’s** (自然) son.
To falsely establish precedence and hierarchy,
to block the source and uproot the root,
to invert the order—how profound the error!
Let me attempt to explain:
**Voidlessness** (虚无) is the **Mystic Root’s** (妙本) essence,
an essence that is not a tangible thing—hence **Voidlessness** (虚无).
**Nature** (自然) is the **Mystic Root’s** (妙本) inherent disposition,
a disposition without contrivance—hence **Nature** (自然).
The **Dao/Way** (道) is the **Mystic Root’s** (妙本) function and manifestation,
so-called **"Strengthening the Right"** (强右),
yet nothing but universal generation—hence it is called the **Dao/Way** (道).
In brief, by naming essence and manifestation,
it is called the **Dao/Way** (道) of **Voidlessness** (虚无) and **Nature** (自然).
Seeking its origin,
it is but the **One Mystic Root** (一妙本),
so what else could one imitate or follow?
Thus, the difficulty of those who are confused
lies in their failure to grasp the **Profound Key** (玄键).

○ **Master He Shang Gong** (河上公) says:
Humans should follow the Earth (地),
and humans ought to follow the Earth’s stillness and yielding softness (安静和柔).
They reap the Five Grains (五谷) and dig sweet springs (甘泉),
laboring without complaint,
acting with purpose yet not claiming the merit.

The Earth follows the Heaven (天),
as Heaven is vast and tranquil, unmoving (澹泊不动),
bestowing without seeking recompense,
nurturing all things,
yet taking nothing in return.

Heaven follows the **Dao/Way** (道),
as the **Dao/Way** (道) follows clarity and stillness (清静),
not speaking of yin and yang (阴阳),
yet circulating the **Refined Qi** (精气) to let all things form of themselves.

The **Dao/Way** (道) follows **Nature** (自然),
as the **Dao/Way’s** (道) inherent disposition is **Nature** (自然),
and it follows nothing else.

○ **Rong** (荣) says:
For the ruler of men (人主),
stillness (静) shares the **virtue/power** (德) of yin (阴),
its burden is without partiality (无私),
following the Earth (地).

Action (动) aligns with the **virtue/power** (波) of yang (阳),
its **covering** (覆) is impartial and just (公正),
following Heaven (天).

Clarity and **Voidlessness** (虚) with **non-action** (无为),
circulating without obstruction (不滞),
all movement in accordance with principle (合理),
following the **Dao/Way** (道).

The **Sage** (圣人) has no desires (无欲),
not dwelling in affairs (有事),
emptying himself to sever all **scheming** (经营),
entrusting things to their **spontaneous transformation** (独化),
following **Nature** (自然).

This is following the **virtue/power** (德) of Heaven and Earth (天地),
not Heaven and Earth following one another.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏):
Humans (人) are rulers (主),
so the **Sage** (王) must follow the Earth’s stillness (安静),
and stillness is the first step in conduct (静为行先),
fixed resolve can generate benevolence (定能生惠).
Hence the next chapter states: *"Agitation leads to loss of rule"* (躁则失君).
Once still like the Earth (地),
one must next follow Heaven’s clarity and **Voidlessness** (清虚),
nurturing all without partiality (无私).

Heaven has the Three Lights (三光),
symbolizing how humans have benevolent illumination (惠照),
Earth is the gateway to **stillness** (定门),
Heaven is the gateway to benevolence (惠门).

Once one can emulate Heaven (天),
one must next follow the **Dao/Way’s** (道) clarity and **Voidlessness** (虚通),
encompassing all things.

Once one can emulate the **Dao/Way** (道),
one must next follow the **profound principles** (妙理) of **Nature** (自然),
the realm of the **Double Mystery** (重玄).

The **Dao/Way** (道) is the **advancement** (进),
**Nature** (自然) is the **Root** (本),
and by the **Root** (本) absorbing the **advancement** (迹),
thus the meaning of "following" (法).
Again, it is explained:
The **Dao/Way’s** (道) inherent disposition is **Nature** (自然),
and it follows nothing else—
its essence transcends all cultivation and learning (体绝修学),
hence it is said to follow **Nature** (自然).

**Double Mystery** (重玄) is the **root of the light** (轻根) in Chapter Twenty-Six.
**Double Mystery** (重) is the reason this chapter follows the previous one:
the previous chapter expounds how humans should follow the Earth (地),
and demonstrates that for those who seek the **Dao/Way** (道),
stillness is the first principle (静为先).
Hence this chapter follows,
to weigh and measure stillness against agitation (校量静躁).

Within this chapter, there are three layers of meaning:
First, it correctly distinguishes the inferiority of **lightness and agitation** (轻躁)
and the superiority of **stillness** (静).
Second, it explains that one who upholds **stillness** (重静) will not act contrary to **tranquility** (寂).
Third, it reveals that those who are **light and agitated** (轻躁) will meet ruin in state and person (亡国丧身).

First, it correctly distinguishes the inferiority of **lightness and agitation** (轻躁) and the superiority of **stillness** (静).
The great **virtue/power** (德) of Heaven and Earth is **generation** (日生),
the great treasure of the **Sage** (圣人) is **proper rule** (日位).
Stillness governs movement (静以制动),
as the thirty spokes revolve around the hub (三十辐之循环),
**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),
and the **Nine-Five Sovereign** (九五君) embodies its perfect manifestation (端委).

Ascending the **Great Peak** (太山) is vast and grand,
returning to the myriad hills (众阜) is high,
wearing the **Jade of Perfection** (玉宸) is for rule (为君),
grasping the common people’s reins (握庶人之纪).

Thus, it is known:
when the six lines are set,
the upper one governs the myriad forms (上一制之於群象),
and the initial division of the eight lines (八有初分),
the lower five stabilize the myriad positions (下五镇之於众位).

Hence, the **Profound Mirror** (玄鉴) is distant and wondrous,
only stillness and clarity (唯静与清) can reveal it.
The **Yellow Palace** (黄屋) holds its august dignity,
only the high and the great (唯高唯大) can embody it.
The **Sage** (圣人) opens his principles,
which can be discerned in detail.

**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),
and **stillness** (静) is the **lord of agitation** (躁君).

○ **Master He Shang Gong’s Commentary** (河上公曰):
**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),
so if the human ruler does not uphold **Double Mystery** (重),
he will not be revered (不尊).
If one does not uphold **Double Mystery** (重) in governing his body (治身),
he will lose his **spirit** (神).
Grasses and trees have **light** (轻) flowers and leaves,
so they wither and fall,
but their **roots** (重) are heavy (重),
so they endure and persist (长存).

**Stillness** (静) is the **lord of agitation** (躁君),
so if the human ruler is not still (不静),
he will lose his **awe** (威).
If one does not uphold **stillness** (静) in governing his body (治身),
his body will be in danger (身危).
The **Dragon** (龙) is still, so it can transform (变),
the **Tiger** (虎) is agitated, so it meets early demise (夭亏).

○ **Rong** (荣) says:
Both great and small are **light** (轻),
yet they cannot serve as **roots** (根本).
Both high and low are agitated (躁),
yet how can they serve as **lords** (君主)?
Thus, one **light** (轻) and one **heavy** (重),
the **light** (轻) takes the **heavy** (重) as its **root** (根).
One agitated (躁) and one still (静),
the agitated takes the still as its **master** (主).

Hence, those who uphold **non-action** (无为) and **heavy stillness** (重静) embody the **virtue/power** (德) of rule (为君),
and those who uphold **action** (有为) and **light agitation** (轻躁) fulfill the duties of subjects (臣之事).

The high and low each attend to their own affairs (各司其业),
and for the ruler (为君),
**heavy stillness** (重静) is essential.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary** (成疏):
**Double Mystery** (重) is the **root of the light** (轻根),
an analogy like a tree’s **root** (根) being **heavy** (重),
and its flowers and leaves **light** (轻).
The **light** (轻) withers and falls,
while the **heavy** (重) endures and persists (长存).

This warns learners not to be **light and agitated** (轻躁),
hence the *Book of Documents* (《书》) states:
*"A gentleman who is not **heavy** (重) will not command **awe** (威)."*

**Stillness** (静) is the **lord of agitation** (躁君),
as stillness is **non-action** (无为),
and agitation is **desire** (有欲).
**Desire** (有欲) brings death (生死),
**non-action** (无为) brings endurance (长存).
Stillness can govern movement (静能制动),
hence it is for rule (为君).

Second, it explains that one who upholds **heavy stillness** (重静)
will not act contrary to **tranquility** (寂).
Thus, the **gentleman** (君子) moves all day,
yet never departs from his **burden** (辎重).»

**Commentary of the Master (御注):**
*"Zhī"* (辎) means "chariot" (车).
*"Zhòng"* (重) refers to the things it carries.
Those who are **light and agitated** (轻躁) must uphold **heavy stillness** (重静),
just as travelers must guard their **burden** (辎重).
Thus, losing the **burden** (辎重) leads to cold and hunger (冻馁),
while indulging in **lightness and agitation** (轻躁) brings disaster (祸乱).

**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**
*"Jūnzǐ"* (君子) refers to the sovereign (人主),
speaking of how his **virtue** (德) can govern the people (人物),
hence it is called *"jūnzǐ"* (君子).
*"Zhī"* (辎) means "screened carriage" (屏车),
*"zhòng"* (重) refers to the things it carries—this is a metaphor.
It says the sovereign must always uphold **heavy stillness** (重静),
just as travelers never abandon their **burden** (辎重).
If travelers lose their **burden** (辎重),
they will have nothing to sustain them,
and they must suffer cold and hunger (冻馁).
If the sovereign indulges in **lightness and agitation** (轻躁),
his ministers will scatter,
he will breed calamities (息祸),
and his state will fall—
hence it is said that the sovereign moves all day yet never abandons his **burden** (辎重).

**Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:**
*"Zhī"* (辎) means **stillness** (静).
The **sage** (圣人) moves through the **Dao/Way** (道) all day,
yet never abandons **stillness** (静) and **heavy stillness** (重).

**Master Róng (荣) says:**
A sovereign who upholds the **Dao/Way** (道),
governing the people (物),
must strive for **heavy stillness** (重静)
and not indulge in **lightness and agitation** (轻躁).
Every action must not stray from the **Dao/Way** (道),
every movement must not abandon **stillness** (静).
Thus, when he travels, he must carry his **burden** (辎重),
and when he resides, he must maintain his **defenses** (摄卫).
This prevents ruin (危亡),
all from **heavy stillness** (重静).

**Commentary of the Master (成疏):**
Hence, it continues the earlier warning and adds new meaning.
*"Zhī"* (辎) means **stillness** (静).
It says the sovereign, who understands humanity (达人),
moves through the world all day (终日行化),
yet never abandons **heavy stillness** (重静).
This is the meaning of "moving yet tranquil" (动而寂).
Even amid splendor (荣观),
he remains detached (超然).

**Commentary of the Master (御注):**
The sovereign must uphold **heavy stillness** (重静),
so even amid splendor (荣观),
he must rest content (燕尔安处),
detached (超然) and unmoved.

**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**
If the sovereign upholds **heavy stillness** (重静),
the people will not be burdened with labor (烦劳).
If he indulges in high platforms (高台),
deep pools (深池),
tolling bells (撞钟),
and dancing women (舞女),
taking such displays as splendor (荣观),
then the people’s strength will be exhausted,
and chaos and ruin will follow (乱亡斯作).
Thus the warning says:
Even amid splendor (荣观),
he must rest content (燕尔安处),
detached (超然) and far removed from such distractions (远离而不顾).

**Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:**
*"Hóngguān"* (荣观) refers to the palaces (官阙) and resting halls (燕舍)
where the queen and concubines reside (后妃所居).
*"Chāorán"* (超然) means to stand far away and not dwell there.

**Master Róng (荣) says:**
What the **sage** (圣人) values is the **Great Dao/Way** (大道),
what he treasures is **heavy stillness** (重静).
Even with the most splendid halls (瑶台琼室),
his dwelling is empty and tranquil (虚寂).
Even with the most beautiful consorts (孋姬飞燕),
his heart remains in **non-action** (无为).
Passions and desires cannot weigh down the true—
*"Hua wū"* (华屋), though grand, cannot deceive him,
and material things cannot burden him,
hence it is said that he is detached (超然).

**Commentary of the Master (成疏):**
For those who uphold **heavy stillness** (重静),
even amid the splendor of palaces (荣华之官观)
and comfortable lodgings (燕寝之处所),
they keep their hearts in emptiness (虚澹),
detached from the world (超然物外),
not taking pleasure in such things,
and though immersed, they are not stained (处染不染).

**Third, it explains that those who indulge in lightness and agitation (轻躁) will lose their kingdom and their life (亡国丧身).**
How can a sovereign of ten thousand chariots (万乘之主)
lightly abandon his body (以身轻) for the sake of the world (天下)?

**Commentary of the Master (御注):**
*"Nàihé"* (奈何) is a word of lamentation (伤叹).
*"Tiānxià"* (天下) refers to the supreme position (大宝之位).
It says: How can the sovereign abandon his body to desire (从欲),
lightly use his life (轻用其身),
and thus forfeit his position (令亡其位)?

**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**
The Son of Heaven (天子) controls vast lands (封),
taxes from a million households (百万井),
and levies tribute of sixty-four thousand (六十四万).
He commands a hundred thousand warhorses (戎马百万匹)
and ten thousand chariots (万乘).
Hence it is called "sovereign of ten thousand chariots" (万乘之主).
*"Nàihé"* (奈何) is a word of lamentation (伤叹).
*"Tiānxià"* (天下) refers to the supreme position (大宝之位).
The sovereign of ten thousand chariots must unite the four seas (四海必同),
and ensure his descendants number in the billions (子孙千亿),
his lineage endure for a hundred generations (本枝百代).
If he governs well, he will achieve **non-action** (无为) and universal transformation (偃化).
If he embraces virtue, he will cut off evil and return to **ren** (仁).
How can he, bearing this heavy responsibility (重器),
indulge in pleasures and follow desires (耽乐是从),
abandon his life to gratify his passions (以身充欲),
and thus sink into ruin (沦胥以败)?
Hence, abandoning his body to desire (一身之欲)
while lightly discarding his supreme position (轻大宝之位),
is deeply lamentable—
thus it is said: *"Nàihé"* (奈何).

**Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:**
*"Nàihé"* (奈何), the sovereign of ten thousand chariots (万乘之主),
*"Nàihé"* (奈何) is a reproach against the ruler (疾时王伤痛).
The sovereign of ten thousand chariots refers to the king (王者).
And yet, he lightly indulges in licentiousness (轻淫)?
It reproaches the ruler’s extravagance (奢恣) and **lightness and agitation** (轻淫).

**Master Róng (荣) says:**
The son of a thousand gold pieces (千金之子)
does not sit idly in his hall (坐不垂堂),
how much more so the sovereign of ten thousand chariots (万乘之君),
who must not lightly move without purpose (岂宜妄动).

**Commentary of the Master (成疏):**
*"Rúhé"* (如何) is the same as *"Nàihé"* (奈何).
The king’s domain (王畿) is a thousand *lǐ* wide,
and the sovereign of ten thousand chariots (万乘之君)
should uphold **heavy stillness** (重静).
Yet he indulges in licentiousness (轻躁),
imposes heavy taxes (厚赋),
and multiplies labor services (繁徭).
He plunders the land for its beauty (禽荒),
and indulges in excess (色荒).
He neglects the world (轻忽宇内),
and his lamentation is great—
hence it is said: *"Nàihé"* (奈何).
**Lightness** (轻) causes him to lose his ministers (失臣),
**agitation** (躁) causes him to lose his sovereignty (失君).

**Commentary of the Master (御注):**
If the sovereign is **light and careless** (轻易),
people will scatter (离散),
hence he loses his ministers (失臣).
If ministers are **agitated and greedy** (躁求),
the sovereign will be disgraced (不齿),
hence it is said that he loses his sovereignty (失君).

**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**
If the sovereign is often **light and careless** (轻易),
he will surely bring trouble (烦扰),
and trouble will cause people to scatter (人散).
Who will remain to serve as his ministers?
Thus it is said: **Lightness** (轻) causes him to lose his ministers (失臣)—
this is a warning to the sovereign.
As a minister, one should measure his abilities before accepting office (量能受爵),
and not hasten to seek promotion (速官).
If he falsifies his path to gain wealth (矫迹干禄),
or deceives to secure honor (饰诈析荣),
and is as **agitated and greedy** (躁求) as this,
disaster will follow (祸败寻至),
and he will be banished (坐招窜拯).
How can he serve the sovereign?
Thus it is said: **Agitation** (躁) causes him to lose his sovereignty (失君)—
this extends the warning to ministers.

**Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:**
**Lightness** (轻) causes him to lose his ministers (失臣),
the sovereign’s **lightness and licentiousness** (轻淫) cause him to lose his ministers,
and **lightness** (轻) in self-cultivation causes him to lose his vitality (失其精).
**Agitation** (躁) causes him to lose his sovereignty (失君),
the sovereign’s **agitation and haste** (躁疾) cause him to lose his position (失其君位),
and **agitation** (躁) in self-cultivation causes him to lose his spirit (失其精神).

**Master Yán (严) says:**
*"Shī chén zuò shī běn"* (失臣作失本),
speaking of how the sovereign’s indulgence in **lightness and agitation** (轻躁)
is like a tree’s roots being shaken (根本而摇动).
If the roots shake, the branches will wither (技木枯),
and the trunk will dry up (桔而槁).
If the sovereign is not **still** (静),
the people will be unsettled (摇荡),
the ancestral temples will be endangered (倾危),
and he will lose his position as king (失其国君之位).

**Master Róng (荣) says:**
Earlier, it was explained that **heavy stillness** (重静)
leads to detachment (超然) and no burden (无累).
Now, it is explained that **lightness and agitation** (轻躁)
will surely bring harm (致有损).
No burden means both sovereign and ministers are at ease (上下俱安),
while harm means both sovereign and ministers are lost (君臣皆失).

「○ **Master Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏):
To indulge emotions and abandon **Daoist restraint** (恣情放欲),
to grow ever **light and agitated** (轻躁日甚),
externally leads to the loss of the realm (亡国),
internally endangers one’s own body (危身).
When loyal ministers are exiled and hidden (忠良窜匿),
this is the loss of **ministers** (失臣).
When ancestral temples are toppled (宗庙倾覆),
this is the loss of **sovereignty** (失君).

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: *The Chapter of **Daoist Virtue** (善行)***
This chapter follows the previous one,
for the earlier chapter expounds on the **sages** (圣人)
practicing **heavy stillness** (重静),
whose actions do not stray from **Daoist quiescence** (寂).
Thus, this chapter elaborates on the **Daoist adept’s** (此人) **virtuous conduct** (行能功用).
Within this chapter, the text unfolds in **four layers** (文有四重):
1. It first elucidates the **Daoist adept of heavy stillness** (重静之人),
   whose **Three Businesses** (三业) are pure and **Daoist stillness** (清净).
2. It then reveals the **Daoist adept of heavy stillness** (重静之人)
   as **firm and unshakable** (结显坚固),
   with the **Six Roots** (六根) **liberated** (解脱).
3. It next demonstrates **transcending traces and urgent rescue** (降迹激救),
   responding to all things without omission (应物无遗).
4. Finally, it illustrates the **Dao of teacher and disciple** (师资之道),
   the **marvels of cultivation** (修学之妙),
   and its **eloquence** (而言之).

1. **The Daoist adept of heavy stillness** (重静之人) **whose Three Businesses are pure** (三业清净).
The **sage** (圣) **responds to the vast Dao** (应圆界),
his **heart** (心) **settled in primordial stillness** (夏心湛寂),
yet **does not act** (不行) while **transcending** (去).
He wanders through the **Midst of Kunlun** (远游昆阆之中),
yet **does not depart** (不出) while **knowing** (知).
He treads upon **Jiaozhen** (瑕践瑶京之上),
the **Daode Palace** (瑶京).

In **stillness**, yet able to **move** (寂而能动),
dwelling in darkness yet ever **illuminated** (处暗常明),
he **pities** (欲) the **myriad living beings** (我苍生),
enduring their eternal suffering in the **Nine Abysses** (九幽).
He **lament**s (叹) those ensnared in **evil and filth** (彼邪秽),
lost in the **Five Desires** (五欲) **for endless ages** (长昏).

Like the **venomous serpent’s head** (嗔蛇头),
even the **wise and virtuous** (贤圣) **dare not approach**.
Like the **drunken elephant’s trunk** (醉象首),
the **enlightened** (达人) **abandon it**.
The **common and deluded** (凡迷) **how can awaken** (从何得悟)?
Thus, **Daoist virtue** (善行) **leaves no trace** (无迹)!
When **rescue** (救) is sought,
the **Dao of teacher and disciple** (师资之道) **is unified** (一齐),
and the **hearts of all beings** (凡圣之心) **are extinguished** (双泯).

**Daoist virtue** (善行) **leaves no trace** (无辙述).
**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**
Within all **dharma** (诸法),
realizing the **true nature** (体了真性),
actions manifest **no action** (行无行相),
thus it is called **Daoist virtue** (善行).

So, the **heart unites with the Dao** (心与道冥),
and **no trace or path** (辙迹) **can be sought**.

**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**
This reveals the **pure nature of dharma** (法性清净).
**Actions** (行) refer to **cultivation** (修行).
When the **nature of dharma** (法性) is pure,
this is called **Triple Primordial** (重玄).
Though one relies on **diligent practice** (勤行),
one must **avoid attachment** (无着),
**gradually extinguishing** (次来次灭)
until **actions manifest no form** (行无行相).
The **heart unites with the Dao** (心与道合),
thus it is called **Daoist virtue** (善行).
To achieve this is to **equalize emptiness and unity** (空有一齐),
where **phenomena and mind are both pure** (境心俱净).
If one seeks **traces or paths** (辙进),
is it not **difficult** (难)?

**Master Héshàng** (河上公) **says:**
The **Daoist adept of virtue** (善行道者)
seeks it **within oneself** (於身),
never descending from the **hall** (不下堂),
nor stepping outside the **door** (不出门),
thus **leaving no trace** (故无辙述).

**Master Róng** (荣) **says:**
The **Seven-Scented Fragrance Chariot** (七香流水之车),
when **moved** (动), has **traces** (有辙).
The **Thousand-Li Cloud-Steed** (千里浮云之马),
when **leaping** (跃), has **pathways** (有述).
Yet **not hasty yet swift** (不疾而速),
**cloud-plowing** (云耕) **does not trample the earth** (不辗地).
**Not acting yet arriving** (不行而至),
the **Phoenix Bird** (凤鸟) **has no trace** (本无迹).
This speaks of the **sage** (圣人) **resting in the hall** (垂拱庙堂),
yet **not following the tracks of Zhou’s kings** (不偏周王之辙),
and the **virtuous scholar** (贤士) **fading into seclusion** (销声丘壑),
**not diminishing the footsteps of Confucius** (不削孔丘之迹).

**Master Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏) **says:**
To **act without action** (以无行为行),
actions manifest **no form** (行无行相),
thus it is called **Daoist virtue** (善行).
When **cultivation is profound** (妙契所修),
**phenomena and wisdom merge** (境智冥会),
no **traces or paths** (辙迹) **are visible** (之可见),
this reveals the **purity of bodily conduct** (身业净).

**Daoist virtue in speech** (善言) **leaves no blemish or censure** (无瑕谪).
**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**
One who **comprehends the teachings** (能了言教),
yet **does not cling rigidly** (不为滞执),
**discards the form to seek the meaning** (遗象求意),
**realizes the truth beyond words** (理证言忘),
thus **speech is free from flaw or blame** (於言教中无瑕疵谪过).

**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**
This reveals the **learned not clinging to words** (学人不滞言教).
**Blemish** (瑕) means **defect or illness** (病).
**Censure** (谪) means **blame** (责).
**Speech** (言) refers to **teachings** (言教).
When **Daoist virtue leaves no trace** (善行无迹),
one **comprehends the teachings** (能了言教),
yet **does not cling rigidly** (不为执滞),
**forgetting speech while in speech** (於言忘言),
this is **Daoist virtue in speech** (善言).
Thus, **discarding forms to guide meaning** (遗象导意),
**truth illuminates speech-forgetting** (理照言忘),
in all **teachings** (言教),
**there is no defect or blame** (一无病责),
thus it is called **Daoist virtue in speech** (善言无瑕谪).

**Master Héshàng** (河上公) **says:**
**Daoist virtue in speech** (善言) **is to choose words wisely** (择言而出之),
thus **no flaw or blame exists in the world** (无瑕疵谪过於天下).

**Master Róng** (荣) **says:**
When **words strike the bell** (言铃有中),
**a thousand li respond** (千里应之),
yet **speak only of the Dao** (非法不言),
what **blame** (过) **could there be**?

**Master Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏) **says:**
**Speech without speech** (不言之言),
**speaking yet not speaking** (言而不言),
**all day speaking yet never truly speaking** (终日言未尝言),
**nor truly not speaking** (亦未尝不言),
thus it is called **Daoist virtue in speech** (善言).
As the *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Words sufficient to convey the Dao
are spoken all day yet exhaust the Dao."* (言而足则终日言而尽道也).
**Blemish** (瑕) means **defect or illness** (疵病).
**Censure** (谪) means **blame** (过责).
**Silence and speech are alike** (默语不异),
thus **no blame for words** (无口过之责).
The original text uses the character **de** (的),
referring to the **sage’s speech** (圣人之言),
which **lacks any target** (既无的当),
thus **no blame for any direction** (故无所之谓).
This reveals the **purity of verbal conduct** (口业净).

**Daoist virtue in thought** (善计) **requires no scheming** (无筹算).
**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**
One who **comprehends all dharma** (能了诸法),
**has no dual paths** (本无二门),
**unifies all with one principle** (一以贯之),
**does not generate other views** (不生他见),
thus **no need for scheming or calculation** (故无劳筹算),
**naturally illuminated and comprehended** (自然照了).
When **thoughts manifest no thought-form** (计无计相),
what is more **virtuous** (善) than this?

**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**
This reveals **teachings not clinging** (言教无滞),
thus **no duality in thought** (则不计异门).
When one **clings to words and stagnates in actions** (执言滞行),
**distinguishing right from wrong** (辨是与非),
even **clever strategists** (巧历) **cannot compute**.
Yet if one **comprehends all dharma as expedient means** (能了诸法皆方便门),
**ultimately pure and unadulterated** (究竟清净),
**not generating other views** (不生他见),
then **no need for scheming or calculation** (则无劳筹策算数),
**one can naturally penetrate the One Vehicle** (自能深入一乘).
When **thoughts are thus virtuous** (善计若斯),
why **labor in scheming or calculation**?
Thus it is said: **Daoist virtue in thought requires no scheming** (善计不用筹算).

**Master Héshàng** (河上公) **says:**
The **virtuous in thought** (善以道计事者)
**holds to one principle without deviation** (守一不移),
**thoughts are few** (所计不多),
**no scheming is needed yet all is known** (不用筹策而可知者).

**Master Róng** (荣) **says:**
**Scheming and calculation** (筹策) **are for counting things** (算物数),
but **the Dao observes all** (以道观之),
**nothing is left unexamined** (物无不尽),
**the Dao transcends numbers** (道非於数),
so why use **scheming and calculation**?

**Master Chéng’s Commentary** (成疏) **says:**
**Mysterious comprehension** (妙悟) **of all dharma as one** (诸法同一虚假),
**not setting up falsehoods** (不设虚假),
**falsehoods reveal truth** (即假体真),
**no need for calculation** (无劳算计),
**suddenly illuminated and clear** (划然明了),
this reveals the **purity of mental conduct** (意业净).

2. **Revealing the firm and unshakable vow** (结愿坚固), **and the liberation of the Six Roots** (六根解脱).
**Daoist virtue in closing** (善闭) **has no bolts or bars** (无关梃) **yet cannot be opened** (而不可开).
**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**
**Both speech and action are forgotten** (兼忘言行),
**not entering false paths** (不入异门),
**the heart does not wander in phenomena** (心无逐境之迷),
**phenomena do not burden the heart** (境无起心之累),
though **no bolts or bars** (虽无关楗),
how could it be **opened**? (其可开乎?)

**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**
This reveals **not clinging to false paths** (不计异门),
thus **the desire-heart naturally closes** (则欲心自闭).
**Horizontal bars are called "guān"** (横日关),
**vertical bars are called "jiàn"** (竖日楗).」

「夫善行善言，不耽不滞，则心照清净，境尘不起，故云善闭虽无关梃，其可开乎？ 故云善闭无关梃而不可开。
The **virtuous Daoist** (善) in **conduct and speech** (行言) who neither **lingers nor stagnates** (耽滞),
then **illuminates the heart with clarity and purity** (心照清净),
and **no dust of phenomena** (境尘) arises—
thus it is said: **"Virtuous closure** (善闭) **though lacking bolts and bars** (无关梃), **how could it be opened**? (其可开乎？)
Therefore it is said: **"Virtuous closure** (善闭) **though lacking bolts and bars** (无关梃), **cannot be opened**." (而不可开)

**Master He Shang Gong** (河上公) **says:**
The **virtuous Daoist** who **closes emotions and guards essence** (闭情欲守精) with the **Dao/Way** (道),
is **not inferior to a door with bolts and bars** (不如门户有关梃) that **cannot be opened** (不可得开).

**Rong** (荣) **says:**
A **door is closed with bolts and bars** (关梃),
**having both closure and opening** (有闭有开).
If one **can control it with the Dao/Way** (以道制之),
there is **neither opening nor closure** (无开无闭).
Thus, **those who govern by principle** (理国者) **use the Dao/Way to bind and restrain** (纂弒),
**so that none may spy upon the realm** (无以窥仑).
**Those who cultivate the self** (修身者) **use the Dao/Way to master speech and color** (声色),
**so that there is no means of opening or breaching** (无由开凿).

**The Imperial Commentary** (成疏) **says:**
Externally, there are **no desired phenomena** (无可欲之境),
internally, there is **no capacity for desire** (无能欲之心).
**The Six Roots** (恣根) **arise and function** (起用),
yet **no defilement occurs** (用而无染).
Thus, it is **closure without closure** (不闭而闭),
**though closed, it is not closed** (虽闭不闭),
requiring **no labor of bolts and bars** (无劳关梃),
hence **it cannot be opened** (故不可开).
This reveals **the liberation of the Six Roots** (六根解脱).

**善结无绳约而不可解。**
**Virtuous bonds** (善结) **lack cords and restraints** (无绳约) **yet cannot be undone** (而不可解).

**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**
One who **fully comprehends the true nature** (体了真性),
**fundamentally forgets in emptiness** (本以虚忘),
if **able to forget in emptiness** (能虚忘),
then **the heart unites with the Dao/Way** (心与道合).
Though **no cords or restraints** (虽无绳索约束),
**how could it be undone and scattered**? (其可解而散乎？)

**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**
This reveals **the virtuous Daoist** (善闭之人) whose **heart unites with the Dao/Way** (心与道合).
**Bonding** (结) is **tying** (系),
**cords** (绳) are **ropes** (索),
**restraints** (约) are **bindings** (束),
**undoing** (解) is **scattering** (散).
**Sitting in forgetfulness and abandoning illumination** (坐忘遗照),
**deeply resonating with the Dao’s source** (深契道源) amidst all **dharma/phenomena** (诸法),
**completely able to not be hindered or bound** (尽能不滞系心於此),
thus it is said: **"Virtuous bonding"** (善结).
**One who uses cords and restraints** (用绳约者),
when **the cords are scattered** (绳散), **the restraints are undone** (则约解).
But **one who bonds with the Dao/Way** (以道结者),
when **the heart is tranquil** (心静), **the Dao/Way is profound** (则道冥),
**allowing all things to flourish naturally** (适使万绿尽兴),
**yet never defiled** (终能一无所染).
Though **no cords or restraints** (虽无绳索约束),
**how could it be undone and scattered**? (岂可解而散乎？)
Therefore it is said: **"Virtuous bonds** (善结) **lack cords and restraints** (无绳约) **yet cannot be undone**." (而不可解)

**Master He Shang Gong** (河上公) **says:**
The **virtuous Daoist** who **bonds with the Dao/Way** (善以道结事者),
**merely bonds the heart** (乃结其心),
**not inferior to cords and restraints** (不如绳索可得解之).

**Rong** (荣) **says:**
**One who uses cords** (用绳之者),
**has both binding and undoing** (有缚有解).
**The Dao/Way controls all four directions** (以道控制於四方),
thus it is **virtuous bonding** (善结).
**All under Heaven unite beneath one** (万国共戴於一人),
**never undone** (不解).
**The cultivator’s heart resonates with the Dao/Way** (修身者心契於道),
thus it is said: **"Virtuous bonds"** (故言善结).
**Embracing the One without separation** (抱一无离),
**it cannot be undone** (不可解).

**The Imperial Commentary** (成疏) **says:**
The **exalted sage** (上士达人),
**prioritizes phenomena over self** (先物后己),
**takes the great vow** (发大弘愿),
**transforms and liberates all beings** (化度众生).
Their **vow-heart is firm and unshaken** (誓心坚固),
**bonding without flaw** (结契无爽).
Since it is **not worldly cords or restraints** (既非世之绳索约束),
thus **it cannot be undone** (故不可解).
However, **vows of the heart are manifold** (誓心多端),
yet **they do not exceed five**:
1. **The vow of awakening** (发心者),
   which is **awakening to the natural Dao/Way** (发自然道意) and **entering the dharma-gate** (入於法门).
2. **The vow of subduing** (伏心者),
   which is **subduing all obstacles and delusions** (伏诸障惑).
   Within **subduing the heart** (就伏心), there are **scriptures** (有文),
   and **these scriptures** (文) **are threefold in their liberation** (尸三解),
   **liberation** (解) **having three grades** (有三品),
   **phenomena** (物) **increasing to nine grades** (增成九品),
   **uniting with the prior vow of awakening** (通前发心), **forming the Ten Transgressions of conduct** (为十转行).
3. **The vow of knowing the true heart** (知真心),
   which **has nine grades** (有九品), **generating the Nine Officials** (即生彼九官).
4. **The vow of emancipated heart** (出离心),
   which **has three grades** (有三品), **generating the Three Pure Ones** (即生彼三清)—
   the **Immortal, True One, and Sage** (所谓仙、真、圣).
5. **The vow of the peerless heart** (无上心),
   which is **directly ascending to the Dao’s fruit** (直登道果), **reaching the Great Luo** (至大罗).

The **virtuous bond** (善结者) is **bonding these five kinds of hearts** (结此五种心),
**without ever wavering in beginning or end** (终始无替).
This reveals **the firm and unshakable vow** (结愿坚固).

**第三明降迹慈救，应物无遗者也。**
**Thirdly, it reveals the Sage’s descent in compassion and salvation** (降迹慈救),
**responding to all things without omission** (应物无遗).

Thus, the **Sage** (圣人) **constantly saves beings** (常善救人),
hence **there is no abandonment of beings** (故无弃人).
The **Sage constantly saves phenomena** (常善救物),
hence **there is no abandonment of phenomena** (故无弃物).

**The Imperial Commentary** (御注) **says:**
Thus, the **Sage** (圣人) **constantly employs these five virtues of teaching** (常用此五善之教以成之),
hence **there are no abandoned ones** (故无弃者).

**The Imperial Commentary** (御疏) **says:**
Thus, the **Sage constantly saves beings** (是以圣人常善救人), hence **there is no abandonment of beings** (故无弃人).
**"Thus"** (是以) is **to elucidate the lower with the higher** (引下以明上).
Though the **Sage’s heart is concentrated and still** (圣人心虽凝寂),
**teaching flows freely** (教则流通),
thus **constantly employing the Five Virtues** (常用五善) to **save beings** (救人),
**so that all may be liberated and enlightened** (令必释然而达解),
**with great compassion and equality** (大慈平等),
**without partiality or exclusion** (无所偏隔).
**All beings are universally guided with virtue** (凡是於人，尽皆善诱),
hence it is said: **"The Sage constantly saves beings, hence there is no abandonment of beings"** (故云常善救人，故无弃人).

**The Sage constantly saves phenomena** (常善救物), hence **there is no abandonment of phenomena** (故无弃物).
**"Phenomena"** (物) **encompass both sentient and insentient beings** (通有识无识).
**Saving beings through virtuous teaching** (救人善教), hence **there is no abandonment of beings** (故不弃人).
**Saving phenomena through a virtuous heart** (救物善心), **there is also no abandonment of phenomena** (亦无弃物),
**allowing all movement and growth to flourish** (使令动植咸遂),
**without any harm or injury** (无残伤者),
hence it is said: **"The Sage constantly saves phenomena, hence there is no abandonment of phenomena"** (故云常善救物，故无弃物).

**Master He Shang Gong** (河上公) **says:**
Thus, the **Sage constantly saves beings** (是以圣人常善救人),
**the Sage’s teaching of loyalty and rectitude** (圣人所以教人忠正者),
is **to save the lives of beings** (欲以救人之性命).
Hence **there is no abandonment of beings** (故无弃人),
**allowing the noble and base to each attain their place** (使贵贱各得其所).

**The Sage constantly saves phenomena** (常善救物),
**the Sage’s teaching to follow the Four Seasons** (圣人所以教民顺四时),
is **to save all phenomena from harm and injury** (以救万物之残伤).
Hence **there is no abandonment of phenomena** (故无弃物),
**the Sage does not demean stone while esteeming jade** (圣人不贱石而贵玉),
**viewing them as one** (视之如一).

**Rong** (荣) **says:**
Thus, the **Sage constantly saves beings** (是以圣人常善救人),
**yet there is no abandonment of beings** (而无弃人).
**If one thing loses its place** (一物失所), **it is mourned and taken into consideration** (虑轸纳隍),
**viewing beings as one’s children** (视人如子),
**how could there be abandonment**? (宁有弃乎).
The **True Sage expounds scriptures** (真圣阐经) **to open enlightenment** (以开化),
**responding to their karmic resonance** (赴感),
**to guide the common** (以遵凡),
**using the Dao/Way to deliver them** (以道济之),
**never omitting or abandoning any** (曾无遗弃).

**The Sage constantly saves phenomena** (常善救物),
**yet there is no abandonment of phenomena** (而无弃物).
**Beginning and end, the Sage employs the Dao/Way** (始终用道),
hence it is said: **"constantly"** (故言常).
**Grace extends to all directions** (惠及万方),
hence it is said: **"virtuous"** (故言善).
**Virtue can broadly deliver** (德能广济),
hence it is said: **"salvation"** (故言救).
**"Phenomena"** (物) **speaks universally of all things** (通言一切),
hence it is said: **"phenomena"** (故言物).

**The Imperial Commentary** (成疏) **says:**
Thus, the **Sage constantly saves beings** (是以圣人常善救人), hence **there is no abandonment of beings** (故无弃人).
The **Sage** (圣人) is **the same as the prior one** (即是前三业清净六根解脱之人也),
**able to take the great vow** (为能发弘誓愿),
**and save all beings** (救度众生),
thus **constantly remaining in the world** (故常在世间),
**responding to all karmic resonances** (有感斯应),
**with compassion and virtue, equal and unceasing** (慈善平等),
**never omitting or abandoning any** (终不遗弃).
**The Sage constantly saves phenomena** (常善救物), yet **there is no abandonment of phenomena** (而无弃物).
**First mentioning beings** (先举人者) **demonstrates the恩 being extended to sentient beings** (恩被有情),
**then mentioning phenomena** (后举物者) **shows the virtue permeating insentient beings** (示仁覃无识).」

**Text:**
「亦言救人，直据黔首，救物爰及四生也。是谓袭明。」

**Translation:**
It also speaks of saving beings—
**directly** (直) **governing the common folk** (据黔首),
**and saving phenomena** (物) **extending to the fourfold life** (爰及四生).
This is called **inheriting the luminous** (袭明).

**御注:**
密用日袭，五善之行在於忘遣，忘遣则无迹，故云密用。
密用则悟了，故谓之明也。

**Translation:**
**The Imperial Gloss (御注) says:**
*"Clad in secrecy"* (密用) is called *inheriting* (袭).
The five virtuous deeds lie in **forgetting and abandoning** (忘遣),
forgetting and abandoning leaves **no trace** (无迹), hence it is called *secret use* (密用).
When secretly used, **enlightenment is attained** (悟了), hence it is called *luminous* (明).

---

**御疏:**
袭，密用也。明，了悟也。
善行救人，在於忘遗，若滞教矜有，辙迹必存，故虽常善救人，终使慧心无滞，如此密用，则能悟了。
故云是谓袭明。

**Translation:**
**The Imperial Commentary (御疏) says:**
*Inheriting* (袭) is *secret use* (密用).
*Luminous* (明) is *enlightenment* (了悟).
Virtuous deeds in saving beings lie in **forgetting and abandoning** (忘遗).
If one clings to teachings or boasts of possession, **traces will remain** (辙迹必存).
Thus, though one constantly performs virtuous deeds in saving beings, **the wise mind remains unobstructed** (慧心无滞).
Such *secret use* (密用) then attains enlightenment (悟了).
Hence it is called *inheriting the luminous* (袭明).

**河上公曰:**
圣人善救人物，是谓袭明天道。

**Translation:**
**Master He Shang (河上公) says:**
The **Sage** (圣人) **virtuously saves beings and phenomena** (善救人物),
this is called *inheriting the luminous Dao of Heaven* (袭明天道).

---

**荣曰:**
善行五者，人物兼济，承道而用，是谓袭明。

**Translation:**
**Master Rong (荣) says:**
The five virtuous deeds—
**saving beings and phenomena** (人物兼济),
**inheriting and applying the Dao** (承道而用)—
this is called *inheriting the luminous* (袭明).

---

**成疏:**
袭，承也，用也。
此即结叹常善圣人，利物无弃，可谓承用圣明之道也。

**Translation:**
**The Imperial Commentary (成疏) says:**
*Inheriting* (袭) means **inheriting** (承) **and applying** (用).
This concludes the praise of the **constantly virtuous Sage** (常善圣人),
whose benefit extends to all without abandonment—
truly **inheriting and applying the luminous Dao of the Sage** (承用圣明之道).

**第四示师资之道，修学之妙。**
故善人不善人之师，不善人善人之资。

**Translation:**
**Fourth, it illustrates the Dao of teacher and disciple, the subtlety of cultivation.**
Thus, **the virtuous are teachers to the unvirtuous** (善人不善人之师),
and **the unvirtuous are resources for the virtuous** (不善人善人之资).

---

**御注:**
师，法。资，取。

**Translation:**
**The Imperial Gloss (御注) says:**
*Teacher* (师) is *law/teaching* (法).
*Resource* (资) is *to take/employ* (取).

**御疏:**
师，法也。
夫善人者，离诸爱染，则心清净，於法无滞，则教圆通。
取喻於水，物来斯鉴，所鉴者则形而有象，能鉴者见象而无心。
善人正慧若斯，故可为不善人之师法也。

**Translation:**
**The Imperial Commentary (御疏) says:**
*Teacher* (师) is *law/teaching* (法).
The **virtuous person** (善人), having **separated from all attachments and defilements** (离诸爱染),
has a **pure mind** (心清净) and **no obstruction in the teachings** (於法无滞),
thus their instruction is **perfectly fluid** (教圆通).
Take the analogy of water—
when objects approach, they are reflected.
The reflected objects have **form and appearance** (形而有象),
but the water itself **sees the appearance without clinging** (见象而无心).
The **right wisdom of the virtuous** (善人正慧) is thus,
hence they can serve as **teachings for the unvirtuous** (不善人之师法).

**不善人之资，资，取也。**
夫火有其炎，寒者附之。
闻道动行，必资宗匠，既说先生之善，须伏弟子之劳，
则不善之人，善人可取以役使尔。

**Translation:**
*The unvirtuous as resources* (不善人之资), *resource* (资) is *to take/employ* (取).
Fire has its **flame** (炎), and the cold cling to it.
When one **hears the Dao and acts**, they must **employ masters** (资宗匠).
Having **explained the virtues of the master** (说先生之善),
one must **submit to the labor of the disciple** (伏弟子之劳).
Thus, the **unvirtuous** (不善之人) can be **taken and employed by the virtuous** (善人可取以役使).

**河上公曰:**
故善人不善人之师，人之行善者，圣人即以为人师也。
不善人善人之资，资，用也。
人行不善者，圣人犹教道使为善，得以给用之。

**Translation:**
**Master He Shang (河上公) says:**
Thus, **the virtuous are teachers to the unvirtuous** (善人不善人之师)—
those who **practice virtue** (行善者), the **Sage** (圣人) **makes them teachers for others** (以为人师).
*The unvirtuous as resources* (不善人善人之资), *resource* (资) is *to employ* (用).
Even those who **practice unvirtue** (行不善者),
the **Sage** (圣人) **still teaches them the Dao to become virtuous** (教道使为善),
thus they can be **employed for use** (得以给用).

---

**荣曰:**
行与道合，德能利物，善人也。
人之仪表，物之楷模，师也。
暗者求明，明者不求於暗，爱之以作役，具之以束修，资也。

**Translation:**
**Master Rong (荣) says:**
**Practice aligning with the Dao** (行与道合), **virtue able to benefit beings** (德能利物)—this is the **virtuous** (善人).
**Human models, exemplars for phenomena** (人之仪表，物之楷模)—this is the *teacher* (师).
The **obscure seek the luminous** (暗者求明),
the **luminous do not seek the obscure** (明者不求於暗),
**loving them to serve as laborers** (爱之以作役),
**providing them with offerings** (具之以束修)—this is *resource* (资).

**成疏:**
善人不善人之师，善人即向袭明之人也，
言此人恒怀大心，先物后己，引导众生，允当宗匠。
不善人善人之资，资，用也，亦是助益之义。
言善人恒在有中化导群品，即用不善之类而为福田，
以彼众生益成我德故也。

**Translation:**
**The Imperial Commentary (成疏) says:**
*The virtuous as teachers to the unvirtuous* (善人不善人之师)—
the **virtuous** (善人) are those who **inherit the luminous** (向袭明之人).
It speaks of such a person **constantly harboring a great heart** (恒怀大心),
**prioritizing beings over self** (先物后己),
**guiding all beings** (引导众生), truly **worthy as masters** (允当宗匠).
*The unvirtuous as resources for the virtuous* (不善人善人之资), *resource* (资) is *employment* (用), also meaning *assistance and benefit* (助益之义).
It speaks of the **virtuous constantly transforming and guiding all classes within existence** (恒在有中化导群品),
thus **employing the unvirtuous as fields of merit** (用不善之类而为福田),
for the sake of **using those beings to perfect their own virtue** (以彼众生益成我德).

**不贵其师，不爱其资，虽知大迷，是谓要妙。**

**Translation:**
**Not honoring the teacher, not cherishing the resource** (不贵其师，不爱其资),
even if **known as great delusion** (虽知大迷),
this is called *the ultimate subtlety* (是谓要妙).

**御注:**
此章深旨，教以兼忘，若存师资，未为极致。
今明所以贵师为存学相，学相既空，自无所贵，
所以爱资为存教相，於教忘教，故不爱资。
贵爱两忘，而道自化也。

**Translation:**
**The Imperial Gloss (御注) says:**
This passage contains **profound meaning** (深旨),
teaching **simultaneous forgetting** (兼忘).
If one **retains attachment to teacher and resource** (存师资), it is not the ultimate.
Now it clarifies:
**Honoring the teacher** (贵师) is **retaining the form of learning** (存学相).
When the **form of learning is emptied** (学相既空), there is **nothing to honor** (自无所贵).
**Cherishing the resource** (爱资) is **retaining the form of teaching** (存教相).
In **teaching, one forgets teaching** (於教忘教), hence **no cherishing of the resource** (故不爱资).
**Forgetting both honor and cherishing** (贵爱两忘),
the **Dao transforms of itself** (而道自化).

**御疏:**
虽知大迷，是谓要妙。
夫物初第进修，两存学相，未能忘教，故贵爱师资。
若能体了行门，学无所学，师资之名既去，贵爱之目不存。
然此章大宗，教之忘遣，语以渐顿，不无阶级，
论其造极，是法都空，故前举为师为资，示进修之路，
后云不贵不爱，将导悟证之空。
则明所以贵师为存学相，学相既空，自无所贵。
所以爱资为存教相，於教兼忘，故不爱资，
鱼相忘於江湖，自无濡沬。
乍闻斯旨，凡俗不悟，执学滞教，则必以为大迷，
故老君格量云，虽知凡俗以此为大迷，
於道而论，是谓要妙。

**Translation:**
**The Imperial Commentary (御疏) says:**
Even if **known as great delusion** (虽知大迷),
this is called *the ultimate subtlety* (是谓要妙).
Initially, beings **begin cultivation** (初第进修),
**retaining both forms of learning** (两存学相),
**unable to forget teaching** (未能忘教),
hence they **honor and cherish teacher and resource** (故贵爱师资).
If one **fully realizes the path of practice** (能体了行门),
**learning becomes non-learning** (学无所学),
the **names of teacher and resource vanish** (师资之名既去),
and the **objects of honor and cherishing do not remain** (贵爱之目不存).
Yet this passage **primarily expounds** (大宗),
the **forgetting and abandoning of teaching** (教之忘遣),
speaking in **gradual and sudden stages** (语以渐顿), not without **progressive levels** (不无阶级).
When **attaining the ultimate** (论其造极),
the **Dharma is entirely empty** (是法都空).
Thus, **earlier it speaks of teacher and resource** (前举为师为资),
**showing the path of cultivation** (示进修之路),
and **later speaks of not honoring or cherishing** (后云不贵不爱),
**guiding toward the emptiness of enlightenment and realization** (将导悟证之空).
It clarifies:
**Honoring the teacher** (贵师) is **retaining the form of learning** (存学相).
When the **form of learning is emptied** (学相既空), there is **nothing to honor** (自无所贵).
**Cherishing the resource** (爱资) is **retaining the form of teaching** (存教相).
In **teaching, one forgets teaching** (於教兼忘), hence **no cherishing of the resource** (故不爱资),
**like fish forgetting each other in rivers and lakes** (鱼相忘於江湖),
**naturally without wetting or staining** (自无濡沬).
**Hearing this meaning abruptly** (乍闻斯旨),
the **common and vulgar do not awaken** (凡俗不悟),
**clinging to learning and obstructed by teaching** (执学滞教),
they will surely **deem it great delusion** (必以为大迷).
Thus, the **Venerable Master Laozi** (老君) **measured the response** (格量云),
though the **common and vulgar consider this great delusion** (虽知凡俗以此为大迷),
**from the perspective of the Dao, it is the ultimate subtlety** (於道而论，是谓要妙).

**河上公曰:**
不贵其师，独无辅也。

故曰不贵其师，不爱其资，虽知大迷，此谓要妙。

**Translation:**
**Master He Shang (河上公) says:**
**Not honoring the teacher** (不贵其师) means **lacking support** (独无辅).
**Not cherishing the resource** (不爱其资) means **having nothing to employ** (无所使).
Thus it is said:
**Not honoring the teacher, not cherishing the resource** (不贵其师，不爱其资),
even if **known as great delusion** (虽知大迷),
this is called *the ultimate subtlety* (此谓要妙).

**荣曰:**
尊师重道，贵也。

师资之义，当贵爱也。
若师不爱於资，壅玄流而不润，资不贵於师，失慧路而难反，
悟之者要妙，昏之者大迷也。

**Translation:**
**Master Rong (荣) says:**
**Respecting the teacher and valuing the Dao** (尊师重道) is *honor* (贵).
**Kindness, benevolence, and skillful guidance** (仁惠善诱) is *cherishing* (爱).
The **meaning of teacher and resource** (师资之义) should be **honored and cherished** (当贵爱).
If the **teacher does not cherish the resource** (师不爱於资),
the **mystic flow is blocked and not nourished** (壅玄流而不润),
and if the **resource is not honored by the teacher** (资不贵於师),
the **path to wisdom is lost and difficult to return from** (失慧路而难反).
The **enlightened recognize the subtlety** (悟之者要妙),
while the **obscure remain in great delusion** (昏之者大迷).

**The Imperial Commentary (成疏) continues:**
**To grasp this subtlety** (是谓要妙), **is to know the profound and mysterious Dao/Way** (能通此意，是谓知微妙要道也).
**The Imperial Commentary (成疏) says:**
**Not honoring the teacher** (师资两忘) **and not cherishing the resource** (圣凡一揆) **is the way of the enlightened**; the **common folk cling to distinctions** (俗知分别), yet though they **seem to be in great delusion** (虽似大迷), **by reason they attain the profound subtlety** (据理而言，实成要妙).

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic (知雄章)**
This chapter follows the previous one because the previous chapter **illuminated the virtuous** (善行之士) who **constantly rescue others**; yet their **method of saving all things** (救物之方) **remains yet to be revealed**, so this chapter **briefly outlines its essence** (故次此章略示其要).

Within this chapter, **four distinctions are expounded** (文开四别):
1. **To discard rigidity and embrace softness** (去刚取柔) is the **essential path for the practitioner** (是修行人要径);
2. **To urge the abandonment of clarity for the sake of hearing** (遣明归闻) is the **model for learning the Dao/Way** (为学道楷模);
3. **To endure humiliation and forget glory** (守辱忘荣) is to **return to the root and reflect upon the origin** (归根反本);
4. **To craft the skilled and embrace the common** (匠成庶品) is to **benefit others and forget one’s own merit** (利物忘功).

**First: To discard rigidity and embrace softness, is the essential path for the practitioner.**
The **rigid and strong are perilous** (夫刚健者凶), **the Daoists warn**; the **heroic and mighty are humbled** (雄壮者屈), **the ancient sages’ adage holds**. Thus, **strong armies do not conquer in the forefront** (故兵强不胜於前), **weak waters break through what is firm in the rear** (水弱破坚於后). **Zhang Hua said:**
*"Do not boast of your glory,
For the Dao/Way abhors excess;
Do not cling to your honor,
For the towering shall fall,
As the wise and noble observe."* (无矜尔荣，天道恶盈，无侍尔贵，隆隆者坠，贤达所作，诚不虚言).

**Knowing the cycle of the four seasons** (是知四时去来), **the shift of cold and heat** (寒暑易准), **the interplay of yin and yang** (二仪回薄), **the waxing and waning of the sun and moon** (日月亏全), **how much more so for those who merge with the Dao/Way** (何况体道融明), **who know to embrace the white while abiding in the black** (知白守黑), **whose wondrous forms radiate in perfect harmony** (妙象圆照), **who discard the heroic and return to the receptive** (去雄归雌)! **To endure through countless kalpas** (历万劫而不为), **to observe the singular heart ever abiding** (观一心而常住), **is to be the valley to which all things flow** (为溪为谷，天下归焉).

**To know the heroic while guarding the receptive, is to be the valley of the world.**
**To be the valley of the world** (为天下溪), **one’s constant virtue/power never departs** (常德不离), **and returns once more to the state of the infant** (复归於婴儿).

**The Imperial Commentary (御注) says:**
**The heroic** (雄) **suffers from the flaw of overuse** (患於用壮), so **to know the heroic is to guard the receptive in stillness** (故知其雄，则当守其雌静), **embracing humility to draw all things** (谦德物归), **thus becoming the valley of the world** (是为天下溪谷). **Then the constant virtue/power never leaves** (则真常之德不离其身), **holding the Dao/Way and nurturing harmony** (抱道含和), **and returning once more to the conduct of the infant** (复归婴儿之行矣).

**The Imperial Commentary (御疏) says:**
**Knowing** (知) **is to discern** (辨识也).
**Heroic** (雄) **is rigid and impulsive** (刚躁也).
**Receptive** (雌) **is soft and tranquil** (柔静也).

**All things value completeness and harmony** (夫物贵全和), **the law seeks the middle path** (法求中道). The **heroic is excessive** (雄则过当), the **receptive is too weak** (雌则卑弱); **both fail to align with virtuous conduct** (俱未适中於善行). **One must take the green cord as the standard** (必当绿督以为经), so **to know the heroic’s rigidity and impulsiveness** (知其雄躁), **one must guard the receptive’s softness and tranquility** (则当守其雌静).

**To guard the receptive’s softness and tranquility** (守其雌静), **one must also know the heroic’s rigidity and impulsiveness** (亦当知其雄躁).
**To know the heroic and guard the receptive** (知雄守雌) **is proper**, **but to know the receptive and guard the heroic is ruinous** (知雌守雄则败). **Ruined, it obstructs practice** (败则妨行), hence the special warning to **guard the receptive alone** (故特戒守雌).

**To guard the receptive’s softness is to embody humility** (能守雌柔，是为谦德), **to which all things are drawn** (物所归往), **as waters flow into valleys** (如水归溪矣).
**The *Er Ya* (尔雅) says:**
*"Water flowing into a river is called a valley."* (水注川日溪).

**To be the valley of the world** (经为天下溪), **one’s constant virtue/power never departs** (常德不离), **and returns once more to the infant** (复归於婴儿). **Knowing the heroic and guarding the receptive** (知雄守雌), **this is called virtuous conduct** (是名善行), **to which all things are drawn** (物所归往), **making one the valley of the world** (为天下溪). **To do so is to never scatter the constant virtue/power** (能如此则真常之德曾不离散).

**The constant virtue/power never scatters** (常德不散), **for this is to embody completeness and harmony** (即是全和). **Those of full harmony** (全和之人) **think little and desire little** (少思寡欲), **serene and unassuming** (泊然未兆), **like the infant** (乃如婴儿), hence the saying: *"Return once more to the infant."* (故云复归於婴儿也).

**River Master (河上公) says:**
*"To know the heroic and guard the receptive is to be the valley of the world* (知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪). **The heroic is likened to exaltation** (雄以喻尊), **the receptive to humility** (雌以喻卑). **Though one knows their own exaltation and display** (人虽自知其尊显), **one must still guard it with humility** (当复守之以卑微). **To abandon the heroic’s strength and embrace the receptive’s softness** (去雄之强梁，就雌之柔和), **then all things shall return to it** (如是则天下归之), **as waters flow into deep valleys."* (如水之流入深溪也).

**To be the valley of the world** (为天下溪), **one’s constant virtue/power never departs** (常德不离), **for those who humble themselves like deep valleys** (人能谦下如深溪), **their virtue/power is ever-present** (则德常在), **never leaving themselves** (不离己也).

**Yan (严) says:**
*"To return to the infant is to return to one’s true intent* (於婴儿复归於志), **to the infant’s brother is to be foolishly unaware* (於婴兄蠢然而无所知也)."

**Rong (荣) says:**
*"To know the heroic and guard the receptive is to be the valley of the world* (知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪), **neither arrogant nor haughty** (不馅不骄), **for this is the middle path** (在於中平), **the conduct of the virtuous.* (君子之行也).
**Neither stagnant nor restless** (不静不躁), **dwelling in the middle harmony** (处於中和), **is the foundation of entering the Dao/Way** (入道之基也).

Thus, **those who harbor the heroic’s fierce heart** (故知怀雄猛之心者), **cannot yet attain full truth** (未可全真).
**Those who embrace the receptive’s soft nature** (抱雌柔之性者), **cannot forget the Dao/Way** (不能忘道).

**To know the heroic nature while guarding the receptive** (令知性雄而守雌), **is to neither be restless nor hasty** (则不躁不速), **and to know the receptive nature while guarding the heroic** (亦知性雌而守雄), **is to neither be stagnant nor delayed** (则不静不迟). **To avoid entrapment in either extreme** (不滞两边), **is to naturally align with the middle path** (自合中道).

**Yet many practice the heroic’s fierceness** (然行雄猛者众), **while few guard the receptive’s softness** (守雌柔者少), hence the analogy: **the enlightened are likened to deep valleys** (故喻明溪壑处下), **to which all currents flow** (众流归之), **and the humble are likened to the Dao/Way’s return** (人士谦退，道德归之).

**The Imperial Commentary (成疏) says:**
*"To know the heroic and guard the receptive is to be the valley of the world* (知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪). **A valley is a path** (溪，径也), **the heroic is yang** (雄，阳也), **the name of rigidity and fierceness** (是刚躁之名), **the receptive is yin** (雌，阴也), **the essence of softness and tranquility** (是柔静之义).

**To know the rigidity and fierceness of the heroic** (知雄躁刚猛), **is to return to death and annihilation** (适归死灭), **while to guard the softness and tranquility of the receptive** (雌柔静退), **is to attain longevity** (必致长生). Thus, **to abandon the heroic and guard the receptive** (故弃雄而守雌), **is to become the essential path for the world** (可为天下之要径).

**The constant virtue/power never departs** (常德不离), **and returns once more to the infant** (复归於婴儿). **To depart** (离) **is to scatter** (散也), **the infant is an analogy for undivided wisdom** (婴儿譬无分别智也). **It says that if one constantly guards tranquility** (言人常能守静), **their virtue/power will not scatter** (则其德不散), **thus returning to their original nature** (故能复於本性), **and embracing undivided wisdom** (归无分别智).

**Second: To urge the abandonment of clarity for the sake of hearing, is the model for learning the Dao/Way.**
**To know the white and guard the black, is to be the pattern of the world.**
**To be the pattern of the world** (为天下式), **one’s constant virtue/power does not err** (常德不武), **and returns once more to the boundless** (复归於无极).

**The Imperial Commentary (御注) says:**
**To guard the receptive’s tranquility** (能守雌静), **one’s constant virtue/power never departs** (常德不离). **Though their virtue/power is clear and bright** (德虽明白), **they must be like darkness** (当如暗昧), **thus becoming the pattern of the world** (如此则为天下法式). **Their constant virtue/power applies without deviation** (常德应用), **never differing** (曾不差违), **and their virtue/power is inexhaustible** (德用不穷), hence it **returns once more to the boundless** (故复归於无极). **To err** (武) **is to deviate** (差也).

**The Imperial Commentary (御疏) says:**
*"To know the white and guard the black is to be the pattern of the world* (知其白，守其黑，为天下式). **White is illumination** (白，照明也), **black is darkness** (黑，暗昧也), **pattern is law** (式，法也).

**Those who guard the receptive’s tranquility** (夫能守雌静), **their conduct becomes radiant and clear** (则德行昭明). **Though their conduct is clear** (德虽昭明), **they do not pursue worldly matters** (不以务物), **and remain like darkness** (当如暗昧), **selflessly preserving purity and harmony** (自守淳和). **To do so is to become the pattern of the world.* (能如此则可为天下之法矣)."

「To be the world’s **pattern** (式), **virtue/power** is always unerring (常德不忒), **returning once more to the boundless** (复归於无极).
**To err** (忒) **is to deviate** (差, *also called* 武).
**Boundless** (极) **is the utmost limit** (穷极也).

**To know the white and guard the black is called complete virtue/power** (知白守黑，是谓德全).
**Those with complete virtue/power** (德全之人) **can become the world’s pattern** (可为天下法式), **then the Dao of true constancy** (真常之道) **flows in response and is applied** (随应而用), **its application never differing** (应用无差忒), **its use inexhaustible** (用亦不穷), hence it **returns once more to the boundless limit** (故云复归於无穷极也).

**Master He Shang Gong (河上公) said:**
*"To know the white and guard the black is to be the world’s pattern* (知其白，守其黑，为天下式). **White** (白) **illuminates** (喻昭昭), **black** (黑) **is silent** (喻默默). Though a person knows their own radiance and clarity (自知昭昭明达), they must **guard it with silence** (当复守之以默默), **remaining like darkness** (如暗昧无所见), **thus becoming the world’s pattern** (如是则可为天下法式也).

**To be the world’s pattern** (为天下式), **virtue/power is always unerring** (常德不忒). If a person can be the world’s pattern (人能为天下法式), then **virtue/power remains constant within them** (则德常在於己), **no longer deviating** (不复差武也).
**To return once more to the boundless** (复归於无极) **and have virtue/power that never deviates** (德不差武), **is to achieve longevity and eternal life** (则长生久寿), **returning one’s body to the boundless limit** (归身於无穷极也).

**Master Yan (严) said:**
*"To return to the unborn* (反於未生), **to return to the unbegun** (复於未始), **is to align with the Dao’s constancy** (与道为常), **thus returning to the boundless** (归於无极矣)."

**Master Rong (荣) said:**
*"To know the white and guard the black is to be the world’s pattern* (知其白，守其黑，为天下式). **Great brightness is like shame** (大白若辱), **great wisdom is like foolishness** (大智若愚). **To conceal oneself and remain harmonious** (晦尔安身), **this is the virtue/power of pattern** (斯为法式).
**Virtue/power** is always unerring (常德不武), **returning once more to the boundless** (复归於无极).
**To err** (忒) **is to deviate** (差也). If a person **does not dazzle others with their wisdom** (不以智耀人) **and does not let fame harm themselves** (不为名害己), **though their inner nature is pure and bright** (内虽洁白), **their outward conduct is like dust** (外实同尘), **then those who establish themselves receive endless blessings** (立身者受禄无穷), **and those who cultivate the Dao attain the boundless virtue/power of the Dao** (修道者成真无极).

**The Imperial Commentary (成疏) says:**
*"To know the white and guard the black is to be the world’s pattern* (知其白，守其黑，为天下式). **White** (白) **is radiance** (昭明也), **black** (黑) **is darkness** (暗昧也). **Pattern** (式) **is law** (法也).
**To display one’s brightness openly** (自显明白) **and dazzle others** (炫曜於人) **is to provoke their resentment** (人必挫之), **which is not truly wise** (良非知者).
**To conceal one’s light and obscure one’s traces** (韬光晦迹), **to retreat and guard in darkness** (退守暗昧), **and not offend against things** (不忤於物), **this is the conduct of the virtuous** (故是德人).
**Those who know the benefits and harms of white and black** (能知白黑利害者) **can serve as the great model for cultivators** (可为修学者之洪范也).
**Virtue/power** is always unerring (常德不忒), **returning once more to the boundless** (复归於无极).
**To err** (忒) **is to deviate** (差也). **Boundless** (无极) **is the Dao** (道也).
**If one constantly abandons brightness and guards in darkness** (常能弃明守暗), **their virtue/power will not deviate** (其德不差), **and having returned to purity and emptiness** (既复清虚), **they will return to the Dao’s utmost** (归於至道).

**The third teaching shows guarding shame and forgetting honor, returning to the root and reversing to the origin** (第三示守辱忘荣，归根反本).
**To know honor and guard shame is to be the world’s valley** (知其荣，守其辱，为天下谷).

**To be the world’s valley** (为天下谷), **virtue/power is then fully sufficient** (常德乃足), **returning once more to simplicity** (复归於朴).
**The Imperial Commentary (御注) says:**
*"Though virtue/power is exalted and honored* (德虽尊荣), **they must always guard lowliness and shame** (常守卑辱), **and things will respond accordingly** (物感斯应), **like a valley echoing to sound** (如谷报声), **endlessly receiving** (虚受不穷). **If virtue/power is fully sufficient** (常德圆足), **then it returns once more to the Dao** (则复归於道也).

**The Imperial Commentary (御疏) says:**
*"To know honor and guard shame is to be the world’s valley* (知其荣，守其辱，为天下谷). **Honor** (荣) **is exalted nobility** (尊荣也), **shame** (辱) **is lowliness and baseness** (卑辱也).
**When in exalted nobility** (处於荣贵), **one naturally rises to arrogance and extravagance** (遂起骄奢), **rewarding the good and punishing the wicked** (福善祸淫), **suddenly declining and falling** (忽然凋落), **thus this honor becomes the foundation of calamity** (此之荣宠，翻为祸基).
**If one knows that elevation and decline cannot be constant** (若知倚伏不可常), **and that nobility is the beginning of misfortune** (贵为祸始), **they must restrain themselves** (应须自戒), **and not indulge in recklessness** (勿为放逸).
**Though in honor and nobility** (处於荣华), **one must always be like the lowly and base** (恒如卑贱), hence **nobility takes baseness as its root** (故贵以贱为本), **and height takes lowliness as its foundation** (高以下为基).
**Thus, to know honor and guard shame** (是以知荣守辱), **the world will submit to it** (天下归奏), **like a river valley receiving all things** (譬彼川谷，包纳虚容也).
**To be the world’s valley** (为天下谷), **virtue/power is then fully sufficient** (常德乃足), **returning once more to simplicity** (复归於朴).
**Simplicity** (朴) **is the true origin** (真本也). **Beginning with knowing the masculine** (始自知雄), **ending with guarding shame** (终乎守辱), **these three stages of cultivation** (三种修学) **are the essentials of the Dao** (为道之要).
**Like an empty valley** (又如虚谷), **it exhausts nothing yet contains all** (罄无不容), **hence the Dao’s highest virtue/power** (所以常道上德) **is fully sufficient here** (於是乃足), **and it can return to true emptiness** (故能复於真空), **reverting to the wondrous origin** (归於妙本也).

**The fourth teaching reveals the artisan’s creation of myriad things, benefiting others while forgetting their own merit** (第四显匠成庶品，利物忘功).
**When simplicity disperses, it becomes vessels** (朴散则为器). **The Sage employs them** (圣人用之), **and they become officials and leaders** (则为官长).」

「The Imperial Commentary: When **virtue/power** (德) is contained within and harmonized (内融), it again returns to **simplicity** (朴).
When **virtue/power** (常德) responds and applies itself, it disperses and becomes **vessels** (器). Once engaged in form and vessel (形器), there must be both refined and coarse (精赢), hence the Sage employs them and they become **officials and leaders of the masses** (群村之官长).

○ The Imperial Exegesis: **Vessels** (器) are **forms and vessels** (形器). From **knowing the masculine** (知雄) to **guarding shame** (守辱), through cultivation of nature and return to **virtue/power** (德), it again returns to the **Dao/Way** (道). Here, when it says **simplicity disperses to become vessels** (朴散则为器), it clarifies that when **virtue/power** (德) is fully unified with the **Dao/Way** (道), it can respond and apply itself. When application becomes coarse (迹粗), it involves **forms and vessels** (形器), hence it says **simplicity disperses to become vessels** (朴散则为器). Once engaged in form and vessel, the **masses’** (村) usage will have refined and coarse (精粗), thus ordinary people employing them can only preserve their own **purity and simplicity** (淳朴), while the Sage’s broad salvation becomes **officials and leaders of the masses** (群村之官长).

○ Master He Shang Gong (河上公) said: When **simplicity** (朴) disperses, it becomes **vessels** (器). The **simplicity** (朴) of all things disperses to become **vessels and their uses** (器用). If the **Dao/Way** (道) disperses, it becomes **spiritual luminosity** (神明), flowing as the **sun and moon** (日月), dividing into the **Five Phases** (五行). The Sage employs them and they become **officials and leaders** (官长); when the Sage applies them externally, they become the **original leaders of all officials** (百官之元长).

○ Rong (荣) said: When **the seed** (种) disperses, it becomes **vessels** (器). The Sage uses them as **officials and leaders** (官长), hence the great measure is without harm (割). Before **qi** (气) is divided, it is **the seed** (种). When the three **kinds of virtue/power** (三种) have positions, they are **vessels** (器). From the **formless** (无形) to opening **manifest forms** (有象), hence it speaks of **dispersing simplicity to become vessels** (散朴以为器). The **noble** (尊) and **humble** (卑) nature of Heaven and Earth being established, the **noble** (贵) and **humble** (贱) nature of ruler and subject is also clear. It is set as ruler, hence it says **officials and leaders** (官长). Governing all under Heaven, hence it speaks of **great measure** (大制). The **high** (上) can nurture and give life (字育), the **low** (下) can receive without harm (不伤), hence it says **without harm** (无割). This also clarifies the Sage’s opening of the **teachings of the unsaid** (不言之教), which is the same as **dispersing simplicity to become vessels** (散朴为器).

□ The true **Immortal Adepts** (真仙) are the **officials and leaders** (官长). They employ the **Dao/Way** (道) to govern all things, and all things return to them—this is the **great measure** (大制). Their **compassion** (慈) can save all things, and all things are preserved whole—this is **without harm** (无割).

○ The *Ceng* Exegesis: The **Sage’s** (至圣) divine **virtue/power** (神力) is beyond thought or speech. Within the **Three Realms** (三界) and beyond, there is nothing not subdued. They lead and encompass all broadly and universally, hence they are called **great measure** (大制). Yet they **nurture and refine all things** (亭毒群品), **molding and tempering living beings** (陶铸生灵), **attributing merit to all** (推功於物), not harming them as a **butcher** (宰主). **Harm** (割) means to **butcher or judge** (宰断).」

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Chapter on "Those Who Would Take the Realm"**

This chapter follows the previous because the prior expounds on **forgetting merit and utility for things**, becoming a **sovereign and artisan** for the realm. Thus, this chapter reveals the **arts of governing the realm and body while benefiting things**.

Within this chapter, the text unfolds in three layers:
1. It first clarifies that **desire and action** ruin the body and destroy the realm.
2. It then presents the **manifestations of action**, demonstrating that all **phenomena are impermanent**.
3. Finally, it contrasts the **Sage**, who **mysteriously transcends attachment**.

**1. Clarifying that desire and action ruin the body and destroy the realm**

A **Dao-governed ruler** is a **non-acting sovereign**. To **take the realm**, one must **align with the times and respond to the people**. Thus, **King Wu of Zhou** overthrew Shang, and the **white banner hung from King Zhou’s head**; **Xiang Yu** ruled Han, and the **Red Emperor perished at his hands**.

Yet those who **do not know the coming of Heaven’s Mandate** and **arrogantly stir up ambition** are warned in the *Treatise on Fate*: *"Dragons, rhinos, and sun-horned beasts are signs of imperial rule; river-eyes and tortoise markings are signs of noble rank."* Is this not so?

The **High Ancestor** (Han Gaozu) **yielded and ascended** to power, while **Qin Shihuang** **brutally seized it** and saw his line **decline**. I see that those who **take the realm by force** cannot **sustain it**. Is this not the truth?

*"Those who would take the realm and do so—*
I see that they **cannot achieve their ends**."*

**Emperor’s Annotation:** *"The realm"* refers to the **precious position of sovereignty**. A ruler must **await the Mandate’s arrival**—if a **violent usurper** seeks to **seize it by force**, it will not endure.

**Emperor’s Exegesis:** *"The realm"* is the **precious position of sovereignty**. Heaven **commands emperors** and **governs all living beings**—this must await the **Mandate’s arrival** before one **rules over all**. Yet **wicked rebels** and **violent men**, who **seek to seize the realm by force**, will be **exterminated before they can even hope for Heaven’s blessings**. Thus, the **Daoist Master warns**: *"I see that such men **cannot achieve their ends**."* *"Already"* is a **particle of emphasis**.

**River Upper Master (河上公) says:** *"Those who would take the realm"*—meaning they **aspire to be sovereign**. *"And do so"*—meaning they **rule through action**. *"I see that they **cannot achieve their ends**"*—because **Heaven’s Way abhors turmoil and impurity**, and **human hearts abhor excessive desire**.

**Yan (严) says:** *"The realm"* is what **spiritual essences** create and **Great Harmony** fulfills—**spiritual essences perceive it**, and even **sages cannot fully grasp it**; **force cannot control it**.

**Li (李) says:** *"Non-action and non-doing"* can **govern the realm**. If one **acts and does**, I see that they **cannot achieve their ends**.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *"Those who would seize the realm and its people as sovereigns"* must **empty their hearts and abandon desire**. If they **seize it through action**, their **failure is already evident**.

*"The realm is a divine instrument*—it **cannot be forced**.*
*Those who force it—**ruin it**."*

**Emperor’s Annotation:** *"The realm"* is the **precious position of sovereignty**, a **divine instrument of Heaven and Earth**—thus, it **cannot be seized by force**. Hence, *"Those who force it—ruin it"*—this warns **wicked and rebellious ministers**.

**Emperor’s Exegesis:** *"The realm"* is the **precious position of sovereignty**, which **cannot be seized by force**—for it is a **divine instrument** meant for **eternal sages** who **spread benevolent transformations**, ensuring that **violent men do not poison the realm with their schemes**. Thus, it is **known that it cannot be forced**, and if forced, it **will surely fail**. This warns **wicked and rebellious ministers**.

**River Upper Master says:** *"The realm is a divine instrument*—it **cannot be forced**."* *"Instrument"* means **thing**—**humanity is the divine thing of the realm**. Divine things **love tranquility** and **cannot be governed by action**. *"Those who force it—ruin it"*—because **governing through action corrupts their innate purity**.

**Li (李) says:** If one **promotes the realm’s goodness without claiming its rewards**, **removes the realm’s harms without taking credit**, and **allows all to drink the harmony of virtue**, then **all things follow transformation in joy**, and one **can securely hold the precious position and guard the divine instrument**. But if one **does not know the error of action** and **clings to it**, then **ruin and loss are certain**.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *"The realm is a divine instrument*—it **cannot be forced**."* All **sentient beings** possess **spiritual essences** and **can receive the Dao**—thus, it is called a **divine instrument**. The **divine instrument** is also the **imperial position**. If one **governs with non-action and tranquility**, all things **prosper in harmony**; but if one **disturbs with action**, all living beings **lose their nature**—thus, it **cannot be forced**. *"Those who force it—ruin it"*—**clinging to action leads to ruin and death**; **fixating on desires causes loss of realm and state*. *"Those who cling—lose it."*

**Emperor’s Annotation:** *"The Mandate rests upon them"*—they have already **obtained sovereignty**, yet they **cling to this position**, **oppressing the divine sovereign**. Heaven’s **retribution will cause them to lose it**—this warns **emperors**.

**Emperor’s Exegesis:** A **ruler** may either **restore order from chaos** or **preserve the ancestral path**. All must **display virtue and block transgressions**, **relieve the hidden and seek the crippled**. But if they **cling to this position**, **oppressing the divine sovereign**, they **bring disorder without form**, causing **Heaven’s retribution to punish the wicked and bless the virtuous**, **divine wrath and human anger to arise**, **disasters to multiply**, and **chaos to ensue**. Who would **obey such a ruler**? They will **surely lose their position**. This warns **emperors**.

**River Master (He Shang Gong) says:**
If one **forcefully clings to teachings**, they lose their **true essence**, giving rise to **deception and falsehood**.

The second principle: **The Sage’s Minister** demonstrates that all **dharma/laws are impermanent**.
Thus, things **move or follow**, **warm or chill**, **strengthen or weaken**, **uphold or collapse**.

**Emperor’s Exegesis:**
To **act is to fail**; to **cling is to lose**. Hence, things may **move ahead**, **follow behind**, **warm by exhalation**, **chill by inhalation**, **strengthen when supported**, **weaken when suppressed**, **succeed when guided by Dao**, or **collapse from lack of virtue**.

**Emperor’s Commentary:**
This illustrates that all things are **not constant**, and affairs **rise and fall in turn**.
**Exhalation (mǘ)**—warm *qi*.
**Inhalation (chuī)**—cold *qi*.
**Weak (yíng)**—feeble.
**Uphold (zài)**—to **manage affairs**.
**Collapse (huī)**—to **ruin**.

Moreover, **action leads to ruin**; **clinging leads to loss**. Just as all things **move ahead or follow behind**, **warm or chill**, **strengthen when supported or weaken when suppressed**, **uphold affairs or push toward ruin**—like **red and black threads**, they cannot be measured by a single standard. Only by **aligning with natural inclination** can one **endlessly promote without exhaustion**.

**River Master says:**
Thus, things **move or follow**—what the **sovereign leads**, the **subjects must follow**.
**Exhale or inhale**—**exhale** is **warmth**; **inhale** is **cold**.
Where there is **warmth**, there must be **cold**.
**Strengthen or weaken**—where there is **strength**, there must be **weakness**.
**Uphold or collapse**—**uphold** is **stability**; **collapse** is **peril**.
Where there is **stability**, there must be **peril**.
This teaches that **rulers must not act**; governing a **state and the body** alike requires **non-action**.

**Honor (Rong) says:**
The **laws of action** have what may be **done ahead** or **followed behind**, **one warmth and one cold**, **one flourishing and one decline**.
**Gathered, they cohere**; **scattered, they collapse**.
If one **acts**, though it **succeeds, it must fail**.
If one **acts without action**, it **can decay yet renew**.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Things **move or follow**—**things** refers to **all phenomena**; **or** means **indeterminate**.
**Move**—**proceeds by itself**; **follow**—**conforms to others**.
This shows that **power and influence are unstable**.
**Exhale or inhale**—**exhale** (*mǘ-xī*) symbolizes **warmth** (*riches and nobility*); **inhale** (*chuī-qì*) symbolizes **cold** (*poverty and lowliness*).
Things may **first be noble then humble**, **first rich then poor**—
like **scarlet summer’s brilliance** or **dark winter’s chill**,
**Heaven’s heat and cold are unstable**, so too are **human fortunes**.
**Strengthen or collapse**—**what flourishes must decline**.
Thus, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says: **"The flourishing must decay."**
This shows that **flourishing and decline are unstable**.
**Uphold or collapse**—**uphold** is **continuity**; **collapse** is **ruin**.
**Continuity is success**; **ruin is failure**.
This proves that **safety and peril are unstable**.
Thus, *Zhuangzi* says:
**"Its completion is its ruin."**
These **eight unstable laws** demonstrate that **all phenomena are impermanent**.
Therefore, those who **govern states or cultivate the self** must **not cling to action or rigid control**.

---
**Third Principle: Responding to the Seated Sage**—**masterfully abandoning attachment**.

Thus, the **Sage eliminates excess**, **eliminates extravagance**, **eliminates excessiveness**.

**Emperor’s Exegesis:**
The Sage observes how things **move or follow**, knowing that **clinging leads to loss**, so they **avoid extremes**.

**Emperor’s Commentary:**
Therefore, the **Sage who governs the world**—
seeing that **movement and following are impermanent**—
knows that **arrogance and clinging must fail**.
Thus, they **restrain themselves**, **examine their conduct**, **cut greed**, and **control desires**.
They **reject excessive action**, **reject lavish adornment**, and **reject excessive indulgence**.
Examining their **names and principles**, they are divided into **three categories**.
Yet their **practical effect** aligns with **one principle**.
**Excess, extravagance, and excessiveness**—all are **transgressions**.

**River Master says:**
**Excess** refers to **lust for sounds and colors**,
**Extravagance** refers to **garments, food, and drink**,
**Excessiveness** refers to **palaces and pavilions**.
Abandoning these three, one **dwells in moderation**, **acts without action**—
then the **world transforms itself**.

**Yan (Yan) says:**
**Excess** is **action**; **extravagance** is **not moderation**; **excessiveness** is **grandeur**.
Thus, they are abandoned.

**Honor (Rong) says:**
**Extravagant Qin**—this is the **action of the past**.
**Pursuing desires is excess**; **a mind set on luxury is extravagance**; **unending indulgence is excessiveness**.
The Sage **empties the mind**, **knows contentment**—this is **abandoning excess**.
**Embrace simplicity, preserve purity**—this is **abandoning extravagance**.
**Forgot joy, then true happiness suffices**—this is **abandoning excessiveness**.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
The **Dao-endowed Sage**, **profoundly embodying emptiness and falsity**,
does not **cling to the eight unstable laws** above,
but **abandons the three temptations** below:
**Excess** beautifies **sounds and colors**,
**Extravagance** adorns **garments and playthings**,
**Excessiveness** expands **palaces and halls**.
Abandoning these **three delusions**, dwelling in **one moderation**—
governing the state brings **long-lasting blessings**,
cultivating the self brings **longevity and clear vision**.

---
**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with Dao**

This chapter follows the previous because the prior **correctly illustrates** that **rulers must not cling to rigid action**.
Thus, this chapter **clarifies that ministers aiding the sovereign** must also **abandon force and employ Dao**.

This chapter unfolds in **three distinctions**:
1. **Assisting the times with Dao**, **calming and settling the military**.
2. **Those who use Dao** **lack arrogance or self-aggrandizement**.
3. **Action contrary to Dao** **leads to peril and ruin**.

---
**First Distinction: Assisting the Times with Dao, Calming and Settling the Military**

When the **Dragon of the Clouds** transforms, **Heaven and Earth grow dark**.
When the **Phoenix soars aloft**, **the rivers rage in fury**.
Why?
Because **clouds amplify the Dragon’s power**, **water nourishes the Phoenix’s ambition**.

Likewise, a **sovereign** must **await a worthy minister**.
**King Wu** met **Ji Dan**—thus, the **Shang’s Dao flourished anew**.
**King Xiang** lost **Le Yi**—thus, **Yan perished in decline**.

「If a person can **expand the Dao**, how could it not be so?

A wise sovereign who secures a **virtuous** minister is like a flying **Hun** (wild goose) with wings,
A sage ruler who meets a **worthy** advisor is like a harmonious dish gaining its seasoning of salt and vinegar.
Thus, Jiang Chong met his end at **Fengchi** (凤池),
And Ho Guang’s statue was enshrined in **Lingge** (麟阁).
Is this not fitting?

**Those who assist the sovereign with Dao** do not **employ arms to overawe the world**—their deeds **invite reciprocation**.

**Commentary (御注)**:
When ministers **employ Dao to aid the sovereign**, they must **yield in submission through virtue**,
Not relying on the **threat of martial might** to **compel strength** from the world.

For **arms are instruments of calamity**, **war is perilous**.
When **arms are applied to others**, others **must respond in kind**—
Their deeds **invite reciprocation**, thus the **fortunes of victory and defeat** are **not easily measured**.

**Explanatory Notes (御疏)**:
*以 (yǐ)* means **employ/use**.
*佐 (zuǒ)* means **aid/support**.
*还 (huán)* means **reciprocate/report**.

It states that as ministers, one should **employ Dao to transform without action**,
**Aid the sovereign to attain the virtue of Yao and Shun**—
That is the **pillar and backbone** of the state.

**Displaying martial prowess** on the **two stages** (of governance),
**Cultivating cultural virtue** across the **four seas**,
**Directing the grand symbol** (of Dao) so that all under Heaven **converge in order**—
When the **great stage is level**, the **world is tranquil**.
But if one **brandishes the terror of weapons**,
**Exhausts oneself in plundering conquests**,
**Raises arms against others**—others **will inevitably respond**—
Their deeds **invite reciprocation**, thus who can **foresee the fortunes of victory and defeat**?

**Master He Shang Gong (河上公) said**:
**"Those who assist the sovereign with Dao"** means the sovereign **can employ Dao to aid himself**.
**Not employing arms to overawe the world**—
**Those who aid the sovereign with Dao** do not **use military force**,
But **follow the Dao and entrust in virtue**—enemies **will submit of their own accord**.

Their deeds **invite reciprocation**—
Their **undertakings invite reciprocation**—
**Self-reproach does not blame others**.

**Rong (荣) said**:
**Loyal ministers aid the sovereign above**,
**Worthy advisors regulate the **yin-yang** (cosmic balance)**,
**Employing Dao to triumph within the seas**—
**Not employing arms to overawe the world**—
The sovereign **also aids with Dao**,
The sovereign **already possesses Dao**—how could he **exclusively rely on arms**?

**If Dao is employed**, then **both sides settle in peace**,
**If arms are employed**, then **mutual aggression ensues**—
**One act leads to another**—thus it is said **their deeds invite reciprocation**.

**Master Cheng (成疏) said**:
**"Those who assist the sovereign with Dao"** do not **employ arms to overawe the world**—
*以 (yǐ)* means **employ/use**,
*佐 (zuǒ)* means **aid and assist**.
*Sovereign* here refers to **the ruler**.

It speaks of those who **employ the true Dao to aid the ruler**—
They must **lay down arms and cultivate culture**,
**Guide the people with virtue**,
Not **excessively using military force** to **oppress the world**.

If one takes it as a **metaphor for the mind and body**,
Then it is the **three poisons and six senses**—arms are **the six senses**.
Their deeds **invite reciprocation**—
*还 (huán)* means **to return/report**.

It states that **external reliance on arms** will **summon enemies’ grudges**,
**Internal indulgence in the three poisons** will **bring the retribution of the three realms of suffering**—
This matter **reciprocates in kind**—thus it is said **their deeds invite reciprocation**.

Where the **teacher’s influence lingers**, **thorns and brambles arise**.
After **great armies march**, **years of calamity follow**.

「**Commentary of the Master (御注):**
Where the military strategist stays, war disrupts agriculture—
If farming is neglected, thorns and brambles arise.

Weapons inflict harm, and drought or flood follows—
Farming is ruined before, and calamities ensue thereafter,
Thus there will surely be years of famine and disaster.

**Commentary of the Imperial Scholar (御疏):**
*Shī* (師), here means the ruler’s counselor,
Yet also the *Yì* (易, *I Ching*) says: *Shī* (師), means the multitude.
When armies are raised and the people mobilized,
Men are weary from service,
And those who march and those who send them off hinder agricultural labor—
Thus thorns and brambles arise.

After great armies return,
Accumulated expenses are vast,
And if the *héqì* (和氣, harmonious qi) brings blessings,
Weapons still inflict harm, drought and flood follow in succession—
Harvests fail, and so there will surely be years of famine and disaster,
To repay the grudges of relentless warfare.

**Master Héshànggōng (河上公) says:**
Where the military strategist stays, thorns and brambles arise—
Farming is neglected, and fields are left uncultivated.
After great armies return,
There will surely be years of famine,
As Heaven responds with malevolent *qì* (氣), harming the five grains—
And when the five grains perish, people suffer.

**Master Róng (荣) says:**
After great armies return,
There are surely years of famine,
And fine crops cannot be planted—
Thus thorns and brambles arise,
This is also the fault of excessive warfare.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary (成疏):**
*Shī* (師), here means the assembled forces.
Where soldiers and horses pass,
They harm both people and things—
Only thorns and brambles grow, no grain.
It is like the unrestrained *yùxīn* (欲心, craving mind) wandering where it will—
Only evil deeds multiply, no virtuous blessings arise.
Thus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—
They dare not rely on force to prevail.
Resolute yet not arrogant,
Resolute yet not boastful,
Resolute yet not proud,
Resolute only when unavoidable.

**Commentary of the Master (御注):**
The virtuous counselor is resolute in halting the enemy—
This lies in calming the people and harmonizing the multitude,
And they dare not seek victory or rely on force.
Thus, though resolute in stopping the enemy,
The enemy does not become a marauder.
Be cautious not to boast of achievements or claim credit,
Lest you become filled with arrogance and pride,
Hence it is a profound warning.

**Commentary of the Imperial Scholar (御疏):**
Thus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—
They dare not rely on force to prevail.
The *Chūnqiū* (春秋, *Spring and Autumn Annals*) states:
*“Killing the enemy is resolute,”*
Yet now it is clear that the enemy-killer
Commands them not to invade each other,
But to stop their violence.
Thus Laozi (老君) says:
*“All actions should be unavoidable,
And those who must use arms
Should only seek to stop the enemy,
Preventing them from becoming marauders,
And should not use the many to oppress the few,
Nor invade others for the sake of force.”*
Their deeds invite withdrawal and retribution—
Hence the warning: *“They dare not rely on force to prevail.”*
Resolute yet not arrogant,
Resolute yet not boastful,
Resolute yet not proud—
The virtue of warfare lies in resolutely stopping the enemy.
Stopping the enemy out of arrogance is not true victory,
Hence, though able to stop the enemy,
Be cautious not to boast.
Boasting leads to reckless taking of credit,
Hence, though resolute in stopping the enemy,
The warning states: *“Do not claim credit for their deeds.”*
If one must claim credit for their deeds,
Then they become arrogant and overconfident.
Arrogance leads to delight in killing,
And defeat comes swiftly—
This is a clear warning, how could one not be cautious!

**Master Héshànggōng (河上公) says:**
Thus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—
Those who act virtuously should be resolute and daring.
They dare not rely on force to gain the name of strength.
Resolute yet not arrogant—
They should be resolute in humility, not boast of their own greatness.
Resolute yet not boastful—
They should be resolute in yielding, not claim credit for their achievements.
*Páo* (骄), means to *overbear or deceive*—
They should be resolute in not overbearing or deceiving others.

**Master Róng (荣) says:**
Thus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—
They do not rely on force, yet use it for virtue,
And stopping the enemy is their resoluteness.
When bandits invade us,
We remove them—
This is not an endorsement of exclusive military might.
Resolute yet not arrogant,
Resolute yet not boastful,
Resolute yet not proud,
Resolute only when unavoidable—
Arrogance is self-aggrandizement,
Claiming credit is self-praise,
Unending desire for victory is *fèn* (忿, resentment),
And showing superiority to the enemy is *jiāo* (骄, pride).
Hence it is said:
*“Righteous armies reign, responding armies triumph,
Resentful armies perish, proud armies are annihilated.”*
The virtuous wielder of arms,
Is resolute and daring,
Not arrogant nor resentful,
Not greedy nor haughty—
When forced to act, they respond from behind,
Their righteousness lies in removing the enemy and saving people,
Not in relying on strength or delighting in war.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary (成疏):**
Thus the virtuous are resolute in their purpose—
*Guǒ* (果), means *firmly determined*.
*Yǐ* (已), means *to stop*.
It states that those who cultivate the Dao and are virtuous,
Firmly determine to halt this violent mindset and not use arms.

Secondly, it clarifies that those who use the Dao
Are resolute yet do not boast or claim credit—
This is resolute yet not forceful.

**Commentary of the Master (御注):**
When the enemy invades and cannot be stopped,
Arms are used to halt them—
Thus their resoluteness lies in responding to the enemy,
Not in using force to prevail.

**Commentary of the Imperial Scholar (御疏):**
Those who are resolute in stopping the enemy,
Are not those who delight in victory and overbear others—
But when the enemy invades and there is no alternative,
Thus it is said: *“Resolute yet not by choice.”*
*Yǐ* (已), means *to stop*.
Using arms to respond to the enemy,
Is not to seek victory—
If one can do so, victory does not rely on force,
Hence it is said: *“Resolute yet not forceful.”*

**Master Héshànggōng (河上公) says:**
Resolute yet not by choice—
They should be resolute in sincerity, not in being forced.
This is resolute yet not forceful—
They should be resolute in not relying on strong armies or formidable armor to overbear others.

**Master Róng (荣) says:**
If one is firmly determined not to be haughty or arrogant,
And acts only when unavoidable,
This is resolute yet not forceful.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary (成疏):**
Resolute yet not by choice—
Like Yáo (尧) attacking the Mǐáo (有苗),
And Yǔ (禹) attacking the Xù (有扈),
These were unavoidable actions, not a delight in arms.
This is resolute yet not forceful—
The first two lines establish that one must firmly decide not to use force.
Thirdly, it clarifies that deliberate actions contrary to the Dao
Will surely lead to peril and destruction.

When things reach their peak of vigor, they grow old—
This is called *bùdào* (不道, contrary to the Dao),
And contrary to the Dao is early ruin.

**Commentary of the Master (御注):**
When things are overused in their vigor,
It is due to relying on force in arms.
When things are overused, they decline—
When armies are too strong, they meet defeat,
This is contrary to the Dao,
And such actions must be stopped early.»

**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**
All things at their peak of vigor grow old,
And armies at their strongest meet defeat.
Thus, armies relying on strength
Are like things in their vigor—
Their vigor only hastens decline,
And strength in arms cannot fully ensure victory.
These two matters are called contrary to the Dao.
Wise ministers and enlightened rulers,
Knowing them to be contrary to the Dao,
Must cease such actions early—
Hence, *"contrary to the Dao is early ruin."*
*"Ruined"* is the same as *"stopped."*

**River Above Master (河上公) said:**
Things grow old when vigorous—
Grasses and trees, at their peak, wither and fall;
Humans, at their peak, decline and age.
This shows that the strong cannot endure long.
This is called contrary to the Dao—
Withering and aging come from not following the Dao.
*"Contrary to the Dao is early ruin"*—
Those who do not follow the Dao die early.

**Honor (荣) said:**
Young yet already overgrown,
Flourishing yet bound to decline—
This is *"things grow old when vigorous."*
It clarifies that armies, when strong,
Will meet defeat and grow weak—
Hence, it is not the Dao.
The Dao can be perpetually practiced,
But what is contrary to the Dao must be stopped early.

**Commentary of the Master (成疏):**
Things grow old when vigorous—
Heat at its extreme turns to cold—
This is the natural order.
Things grow old when vigorous—
This meaning is inevitable.
Called contrary to the Dao,
Contrary to the Dao is early ruin—
Things grow old when vigorous,
Armies grow weak when strong,
For they lack humility and gentleness,
Thus not the true Dao—
Hence, they must be halted and not pursued.

**Chapter 31: The Chapter on Excellent Arms (佳兵章)**
This chapter follows the previous one,
For though the prior chapter expounds on ceasing arms and practicing the Dao,
Its meaning regarding the Dao’s application remains incomplete.
Thus, this chapter clarifies:
When rectifying the times through the Dao,
One must rely on both *quan* (权, expedient means) and *shi* (实, true principle).

This chapter unfolds in four distinctions:
First, it clarifies that though armies may seek strength,
The Dao forbids such actions.
Second, it reveals how things respond to the times,
And the superiority or inferiority of the two intelligences (*quan* and *shi*).
Third, it shows that *quan* does not abandon *shi*,
And action does not depart from truth.
Fourth, it broadly outlines military laws,
To demonstrate the superiority of *shi*-intelligence.

**First: Though armies may seek strength, the Dao forbids it.**
Heaven’s Dao aids what is natural—
To oppose it brings misfortune.
Human affairs require tranquility—
Disturbance brings calamity.
In the age of the Three Sovereigns,
Pure transformation abandoned arms.
In the age of the Five Emperors,
Ceremonial deference discarded warfare.
From then onward, ruthless ambition arose—
Thus, Bai Qi led armies, deceitfully burying Zhao’s soldiers alive,
And Tian Dan commanded troops, crushing Yan’s city.
They could not harmonize with humanity,
Nor adapt to the times—
Their evil spread through generations,
Yet they sought personal security.
How could they know the Old Master’s hatred of cruel weapons?
Standing alone, self-guarded,
Silent on the left, he issued clear warnings to all,
Commanding them to avoid cruel weapons,
And thus earned great virtue!
Why resort to killing?

Excellent arms are instruments of ill omen.
Things naturally abhor them—
Thus, those who follow the Dao do not wield them.

**Commentary of the Master (御注):**
*"Excellent"* means *"good."*
*"Arms"* refers to *"strategic schemes."*
All who cultivate speech and establish sincerity,
Unable to conceal their virtue with morality,
Instead take pride in military schemes and tactics—
For these schemes rely on conquest, slaughter, and destruction,
Making them instruments of evil.
Even things naturally abhor them—
Thus, those who follow the Dao do not involve themselves in such matters.

**Commentary of the Master (御疏):**
Excellent arms are instruments of ill omen—
*"Excellent"* means *"good,"*
*"Arms"* refers to *"strategic schemes."*
*"Ill omen"* means *"not good."*
*"Instruments"* are *"evil tools."*
The virtuous cultivate virtue and refine their conduct,
Must be cautious from the start,
Concealing their abilities within,
Acting only when the time is right,
Their minds wandering through the realms of morality,
Their thoughts exploring the forests of ancient wisdom,
So their brilliance shines and their deeds prosper.
Yet some take pride in military schemes and tactics as excellence.
For strategic schemes rely on deception—
*"The Book of Changes"* says, *"Oddness is the basis of the extraordinary,"*
And military writings emphasize *"striking first in sound, second in action,"*
All centered on conquest, slaughter, and destruction—
Thus, they are evil tools.
Things naturally abhor them—
Hence, those who follow the Dao do not involve themselves in such matters.
To cultivate virtue in oneself is the true endeavor.
Since these are instruments of ill omen,
Even things naturally abhor them—
How much more would the virtuous avoid them?
Thus, *"those who follow the Dao do not wield them."*

**River Above Master (河上公) said:**
Excellent arms are instruments of ill omen—
*"Ill omen"* means *"not good."*
Arms disturb the spirit and muddy the harmonious *qi*—
They are not tools for the virtuous and should not be adorned.
Things naturally abhor them—
For whenever arms are used, harm ensues,
Thus, all things abhor them.
Hence, those who follow the Dao do not wield them—
Those who follow the Dao do not rule such lands.

**Honor (荣) said:**
*"Excellent"* means *"ornamented,"*
*"Ill omen"* means *"not good."*
Arms, when used, bring ruin to states and loss of lives—
Thus, they are called *"not good."*
Life is what people cherish,
Death is what things abhor—
Death is what things abhor,
Thus, enlightened rulers do not take pride in arms.

**Commentary of the Master (成疏):**
Excellent arms are instruments of ill omen—
*"Excellent"* means *"ornate."*
*"Ill omen"* means *"not good."*
Though frost-laden spears gleam in the sun,
And jade-like blades shine in the sky—
These are tools of famine and disaster,
Not instruments of peace.
Internally, they dissolve the three poisons and six senses—
If one sharpens these senses yet clings to desires,
Such actions are evil.
Things naturally abhor them—
Thus, those who follow the Dao do not wield them.
All beings fear arms and abhor greed,
Thus, those who practice the Dao do not fix their minds on arms or desires.

---
**Second: Revealing how things respond to the times, and the superiority or inferiority of the two intelligences (*quan* and *shi*).**

The virtuous, at rest, value the left;
In war, they value the right.

**Commentary of the Master (御注):**
*"Left"* is *"yang."*
Yang harmonizes and brings forth life—
Thus, it is valued in peaceful times.
*"Right"* is *"yin."*
Yin congeals and brings severity—
Thus, it is valued in war.

「Yang favors life, yin favors death.
Favoring life, thus it is prized in times of peace.
Favoring death, thus it is prized in war.
○ Master of the Yellow River (河上公) says:
In peace, the virtuous prize the left—
the gentle and weak.
In war, they prize the right—
the strong and resolute.
This states that the Way of arms and the Way of the virtuous are opposed,
yet their prized qualities differ.

○ Yan (严) says:
The virtuous are rulers of the land,
and prizing the left means valuing growth and nurturing.

○ Rong (荣) says:
The *Classic of Heavenly Patterns* (经天) speaks of *wen* (文) as peace,
and *wu* (武) as martial.
Though their uses are equal in essence,
rites and music must both be practiced,
and water and fire must be managed with difficulty.
War must be waged with reason,
action must follow the proper time—
thus, in peace, favoring life takes precedence,
and in war, the right is prized.

○ Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):
Those who possess the virtue of a ruler are called *junzi* (君子).
The left field is auspicious, favoring life and prosperity.
The right field is ominous, favoring death and severity.
It says that in times of peace, the *junzi* prizes the left and uses *wen* (文),
while in chaotic times, they prize the right and use *wu* (武).
This illustrates that true wisdom values longevity,
while expedient wisdom acts at times with severity—
thus the *Sutra on Guiding Sentient Beings* (度人经) says:
"Thousands upon thousands behead, tens of thousands dismember."
Arms are an ill-omened instrument,
○ Master’s Annotation (御注): *Ill-omened* means *not virtuous* (不善).
Those who favor arms uphold severity—
thus they are not virtuous material.
○ Master’s Exegesis (御疏):
Arms are ill-omened instruments,
not the tools of the *junzi*.
The earlier text states that fine arms are ill-omened instruments,
for when war is waged, one upholds the right and favors severity—
thus those who follow the Dao do not employ them.
This text says that arms are ill-omened instruments,
corresponding with the earlier passage to clarify that they are not the *junzi*’s tools.
The *junzi* uses virtue and the Dao as their instruments—
thus nothing can harm them.

○ Master of the Yellow River says:
Arms are not virtuous instruments.
○ Rong says:
Arms are ill-omened instruments,
not the tools of the *junzi*.
Though arms may be used,
they often cause injury—
this is the domain of claws and teeth,
not the ruler’s proper function.
○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:
Arms are ill-omened instruments,
not the tools of the *junzi*.
When used unavoidably,
they serve as a last resort—
thus the earlier text reiterates that arms are ill-omened,
not the tools of virtuous ones.
They must be employed only to subdue the wicked and aid the distressed,
used unavoidably—
expedient wisdom is the same.
To make arms the primary instrument,
is to wield a yin-strong axe that harms one’s own body—
thus they are called ill-omened instruments.
Not the tools of the *junzi*.
○ Master’s Annotation:
The *junzi* uses virtue and the Dao as their instruments—
they do not prize the schemes of arms.

○ Master of the Yellow River says:
They are not instruments the *junzi* should rely upon.

**Third: Demonstrating that expedient wisdom does not abandon true wisdom, and responses do not stray from authenticity.**
When unavoidable, use them—
yet tranquility is supreme.

○ Master’s Annotation:
When the *Rongdi* (戎狄) invade internally,
one must act unavoidably.
The virtuous conquer without contention—
thus tranquility is supreme.

○ Master’s Exegesis:
The virtue of *wen* (文) is the instrument of governance.
Arms are its auxiliary.
Thus it is said that *wen* governs like the threads of heaven and earth,
while *wu* (武) subdues calamities and chaos.
Though heaven produces five materials,
discarding one is impossible—
yet martial prowess must be tempered with restraint,
and moderation preserved.
Thus, the proper use of arms has its roots and branches,
its order and disorder—
all depend on circumstances.
When unavoidable, one responds—
meaning when the four quarters invade,
and the royal armies engage in battle,
one must still show them mercy,
and temper actions with virtue and the Dao.
Though one may repel like a mosquito stinging,
one should not lean on wrathful intent.
From this perspective,
tranquility is supreme.

○ Master of the Yellow River says:
Tranquility is supreme—
not greedily coveting land or wealth for others.

○ Rong says:
Tranquility is stillness—
the king deploys troops,
but only when called to defend,
never for reckless warfare.
Action does not lose stillness—
thus it is called tranquility.
They do not take pleasure in using arms.

○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:
Tranquility is non-action—
the *junzi*’s heart is also non-action,
so though arms are used,
they are not deemed beautiful.
This illustrates that practitioners, though employing expedient wisdom,
still hold true wisdom supreme—
responses do not stray from authenticity.
Victory is not beautiful.
Those who find beauty in victory,
are those who delight in killing.
But those who delight in killing,
cannot achieve their ambitions in the world.

○ Master’s Annotation:
To conquer an enemy,
one must pity them—
thus victory is not deemed beautiful.
Though victory brings many deaths,
if one takes victory as beautiful,
then one delights in killing many.
Delighting in killing many,
people will not follow.
To seek worldly ambition,
is it not difficult?
○ Master’s Exegesis:
Victory is not beautiful,
yet those who find beauty in it
are those who delight in killing.
Unable to embrace others with virtue,
they rely on arms to seek victory—
though they may triumph,
they still feel shame at their lack of virtue.
Victory must bring many deaths,
so those who take victory as beautiful
are those who enjoy killing.
Those who delight in killing,
cannot achieve their ambitions in the world.
The ruler is the parent of the people—
to find beauty in arms and killing
is not to nurture them.

○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:
Victory is not beautiful,
yet those who find beauty in it
are those who delight in killing.
The ruler, who delights in killing,
cannot achieve their ambitions in the world.
A ruler must not arbitrarily take lives—
they must not impose punishments recklessly.

○ Rong says:
The ruler is the parent of the people—
finding beauty in arms and killing
is not to nurture them.

「○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:
If one finds beauty in victory,
they will delight in killing.
If one finds beauty in fine arms,
then they love to wield the sword and spear.

To delight in killing—
this is what all under heaven detest.
With many slain in battle,
they cannot achieve their true ambitions.

The fourth passage broadly cites military laws
to illustrate the Daoist principle of **real wisdom’s victory**—
auspicious matters are placed on the left,
inauspicious matters on the right.
The **Viceroy-General** stands on the left,
the **Supreme-General** on the right.

○ **Imperial Commentary:**
The Viceroy-General is of lower rank,
placed on the left because they do not hold sole authority over killing.
The Supreme-General’s exalted status
places them on the right, as they command military strategy.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Auspicious matters are placed on the left,
inaspicious matters on the right—
the left embodies the **Yang Principle**, the source of life, hence auspicious.
The right embodies the **Yin Principle**, the path of killing, hence inauspicious.
*The Record of Rites (Liji) – Tan Gong* states:
When the Master stood with his disciples,
he bowed and took the rightmost position.
The disciples also took the rightmost position.
The Master said:
“My disciples’ zeal for learning
is but as my sorrow for my sister’s death.”
The disciples then took the leftmost position.

The Viceroy-General stands on the left,
the Supreme-General on the right—
this is to liken military command to funeral rites.
The Supreme-General, placed on the right,
holds sole authority over killing,
while the Viceroy-General, as deputy,
does not command life and death,
thus standing on the left.

Now, the left is exalted,
the right is lowly—
the Supreme-General, though now placed on the right,
is likened to the funeral rites’ position,
for though they command killing,
they are treated with the solemnity of death.
○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
The left is the auspicious position,
the right is the funeral position.
Now, the Viceroy-General, of lesser rank,
stands on the left,
while the Supreme-General,
of greater rank, stands on the right—
this is to clarify that even if they command killing,
they are placed with the rites of death and mourning.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
The funeral rites place the position on the right,
and now the Supreme-General stands on the right—
this is to liken them to the rites of death.
The departed are honored with **Yin**,
and killing many in battle
is met with tears of sorrow and lamentation.
○ **Imperial Commentary:**
Because life is precious yet must be sacrificed in war,
there is a compassionate and benevolent heart
that mourns the loss,
and this is fitting.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
To wage war and seek victory
must inevitably bring many deaths.
Victory is not beautiful,
so the Supreme-General mourns in sorrow and lamentation.
The people are the foundation of the state—
if they are secure, the state is at peace.
Now, in battle, many are slain,
so the benevolent heart feels sorrow and pity,
and this is indeed appropriate.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
This reflects the fear that one’s own **virtue/power** is thin,
unable to transform the people through the Dao,
and thus harming the innocent.

○ **Master Rong’s Commentary:**
The purpose of arms is to uphold justice
and rescue the people.
To mourn is to lament their straying from the Dao,
to sorrow is to regret the harm done.
In ancient times, the use of arms was guided by **compassion (慈)**,
and military affairs were valued by **virtue/power (德)**,
not by weapons alone.
After defeating the enemy,
the Supreme-General wore plain attire
and took charge of the funeral rites,
accepting condolences as part of the ceremony.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Wherever arms are used,
slaughter and harm abound.
Thus the Supreme-General mourns,
pitying the loss of life,
fearing that the Dao was not followed
and that the innocent may be harmed.

Victory in battle is treated with funeral rites—
the Supreme-General, though placed on the right,
is likened to the rites of death.
The right is exalted for the living,
yet now the Supreme-General stands on the right—
this is because war is an **unauspicious instrument**,
so they are honored with mourning attire,
though it is not truly a funeral rite.
○ **Imperial Commentary:**
When a warrior gains victory in battle,
they receive their title and stand on the right—
a position not auspicious,
hence it is likened to funeral rites.
But war is merely an **unauspicious instrument**,
so why must they don mourning robes
and use a staff of office
before it can be called funeral rites?
All commentaries on this meaning
claim that such a custom existed in antiquity,
but upon examining the ancient texts,
there is no evidence to support it.
The present interpretation is unsettling,
so it is omitted.

Again, citing the case of Qin Bo weeping before his defeated teacher—
this was lamentation for defeat,
not for victory in battle.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
In ancient times,
when victory was achieved,
the Supreme-General would take the funeral master’s position,
wearing plain attire and mourning,
to show that the **gentleman values virtue/power (德) over arms (兵)**,
and killing is only done when unavoidable.
Their reluctance toward killing
is likened to the sorrow of mourning.

Knowing that later ages would not cease from using arms,
they mourned in sorrow and grief.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
The **gentleman** and the **good person** value the use of the Dao.
When forced to resort to arms,
they do so only out of necessity.
Though they may defeat the enemy,
they do not take it as a good thing,
so they wear plain attire and mourn,
and still observe funeral rites in burial.

Though their martial prowess surpasses their literary skill,
this shows that **strategic expedience (权)** is inferior to **true wisdom (实)**.
In governing the state,
one must resort to arms when necessary,
and to **strategic expedience** when unavoidable.
By this measure,
it is clear that **strategic expedience is weaker than true wisdom**,
and that **martial force is lesser than virtue/power**.

「Emperor Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary and Exegesis
*Commentaries by Master He Shang, Lord Yan Junping, and Li Rong*
*Exegesis by Master Xihua, Fa Xuan Ying, and Master Qiang Si of Mengyang*

**Chapter Thirty-Two: Dao Constantly Without Name**

The reason this chapter follows the previous is that the prior chapter illustrates that "good arms are not auspicious," hence one with the Dao does not dwell in them. This chapter demonstrates that if a sovereign and king upholds the Dao, then all things will naturally submit to them.

This chapter is divided into four parts within itself:
The first marks the "Nameless One" to elucidate the Dao,
the second cites the sovereign who upholds the Dao and thereby attracts blessings,
the third introduces the creation of named things and expands their applications,
and the fourth concludes with the Dao descending to the "Nameless One."

**First: Marking the "Nameless One" to Elucidate the Dao.**

The most profound Dao, the true essence of the Way,
is the precious *Zhenjing* of the Supreme Official.
Its source is unfathomable, its nature serene and undisturbed—
length and brevity are equalized,
so that the morning mushroom and the ancient tree share the same lifespan;
foolishness and wisdom are unified,
so that the mythical *Tao* and *Liang* creatures merge into the dual *Zhuang* and *Yuan*.

From the root to the branches, all distinctions dissolve,
unified in speech yet divided in form,
encompassing all phenomena yet returning to the True.
Across the three lives, purity is complete—
names vanish, dust and hues dissolve,
and the transformation manifests:
the white deer appears at *Ren’an*,
the purple cakes descend to *Yinzǔ*.
Its application is present,
yet its name remains ever without—
when sovereigns and kings uphold it,
the *Xianzhang* trees flourish like sweet dew,
and the *Lieshi* naturally incline toward it,
their ears cooled by the breeze of *Chengfeng*,
the Great Harmony without name—
truly, there is good reason for this.

**Dao Constantly Without Name,**
though *Pu* is small,
the world dares not treat it as a subject.

*Imperial Commentary*: The Dao is constant in its application;
this constancy can respond to all things,
and its responses are not singular,
hence "constant without name."

*Imperial Exegesis*: Its application is inexhaustible,
adapting only to what is sensed—
this is the Dao’s constancy.
The constancy lies in its application,
yet its responses are not singular,
hence "constant without name,"
and thus it is said: *Dao Constantly Without Name*.

*Master He Shang* says: The Great Dao can be both yin and yang,
can contract and expand,
can be vast or minute,
can preserve or vanish—
hence it has no constant name.

*Pu* is the wondrous origin.

When speaking of its universal generation, it is called *Dao Yi* (One Dao);
when discussing its refined unity, it is called *Pu*.
The wondrous origin, refined and singular,
thus remains tranquil yet responsive in application.

The craftsman completes all universal generation—
this is the utmost greatness.
Hence, none dare treat the Dao as a subject.

*Lord Rong* says: All named things are universally without constancy;
yet now it is said to return to the constant Dao.
*Pu* is the origin; *chén* (subject) is the lowly.
The constant Dao is the wondrous origin—
neither great nor small,
though great, it cannot be prized,
though small, it cannot be belittled.
If sovereigns and kings uphold it,
all things will naturally submit.

*Imperial Commentary*: If sovereigns and kings uphold the Dao,
refined and singular,
acting without action,
then all things will naturally submit and serve them.

*Imperial Exegesis*: It speaks that if sovereigns and kings embrace and uphold
the wondrous origin, refined and singular,
acting without action or affairs,
then the eight extremes will look upward in transformation,
the four seas will return to virtue,
and all will bathe in virtue and drink in harmony,
naturally submitting and serving.

**Second: Citing the Upholding of the Dao and the Attraction of Auspicious Blessings.**

When Heaven and Earth unite,
they descend sweet dew—
none commands it, yet it naturally equalizes.

*Imperial Exegesis*: When sovereigns and kings uphold the Dao,
bringing about harmony,
there will be no calamities of drought or sandstorms,
the earth will be level and Heaven complete,
the two *qi* blending in equilibrium,
uniting to descend sweet dew—
auspicious blessings will naturally manifest for the sovereigns and kings.

*Master He Shang* says: *Fa Tong* also says:
When Heaven and Earth unite,
it refers to the ruler upholding *Dao De*,
uniting with Heaven and Earth,
harmonizing *qi* so that it flows smoothly,
auspicious blessings naturally descending—
none commands, yet transformation naturally equalizes.

Sweet dew is the fluid of harmonized *qi*.

**Third: The Beginning of Creation and the Expansion of Its Applications.**

The creation of named things begins—
once names have been established,...

「**御注**: The ruler, through *Dao De* governance and equilibrium,
begins to regulate and govern named things—
thus, all named things are entirely under the sway of sovereigns and kings.
*既 (jì)*, here means *exhaustive/all*.

**御疏**: *制 (zhì)*, meaning *to govern/regulate*.
The *有名 (yǒumíng)* are the named things of the world.
*既 (jì)*, here also means *exhaustive/all*.
When sovereigns and kings embrace and uphold the *精一 (jīngyī)* of the Dao,
Heaven descends auspicious blessings,
and benevolent transformations occur without intent—
uniform and balanced as one.

Thus, they begin to govern all named things,
and things return to those who uphold the Dao—
so all named things are entirely under the sway of sovereigns and kings.

**河上公曰**: *始 (shǐ)*, the Dao.
*有名 (yǒumíng)*, all things.
The Dao, though nameless, can regulate the named;
the formless can regulate the formed.
He who knows *止 (zhǐ)* knows cessation.
Knowing cessation brings no peril.

**御注**: If sovereigns and kings can govern named things,
then all named things will also know to depend upon the sovereigns and kings—
to depend upon the ruler who upholds the Dao,
and thus avoid perilous affairs.

**御疏**: *殆 (dài)*, meaning *danger/peril*.
If sovereigns and kings transform through the Dao,
all things naturally submit and serve—
thus, all named things will know to depend upon the sovereigns and kings.
To depend upon the ruler who upholds the Dao,
is to avoid affairs that bring ruin and peril.
Hence, it is said: *Knowing cessation brings no peril*.

**河上公曰**: The laws of the named are all bound by desires,
rebelling against the Dao and departing from *德 (virtue/power)*—
thus, the body incurs destruction and dishonor.
The *经 (sutra/classic)* says: *Knowing cessation brings no peril*.

**成疏**: When the *筌蹄 (quán tí)*—the snares and traps—are forgotten,
the wondrous logic is attained.
*止 (zhǐ)* unites name with reality—
thus, there is no peril.

**荣曰**: The child depends upon the mother’s bell without harm,
just as people depend upon the Dao—
thus, there is no peril.

**Fourth: The Dao/Way in the World, Illustrated by Its Completion.**

The Dao/Way in the world
is like streams and valleys to rivers and seas.

**御注**: Heaven descends sweet dew as an auspicious blessing,
and the ruler who upholds the Dao nurtures the world—
Heaven responds accordingly,
just as streams and valleys flow into rivers and seas.

**御疏**: Here, it illustrates that when sovereigns and kings uphold the Dao,
Heaven must respond to it—
hence, it is said: *The ruler who upholds the Dao governs the world with benevolent virtue*,
and thus brings about universal peace.
Harmonized *qi* moves Heaven,
and Heaven’s auspicious blessings must respond—
like the waters of streams and valleys
flowing into the rivers and seas.

**王弼曰**: This passage clarifies that the Dao does not dwell within the world,
yet today we speak of its laws in the world.
It is likened to streams and valleys flowing into rivers and seas—
streams and valleys are the lesser,
used to illustrate the *有名 (yǒumíng)*—the named;
rivers and seas are the origin,
used to illustrate the *无名 (wúmíng)*—the nameless.

From whence do streams and valleys come?
From rivers and seas.
Where do they return today?
Back to rivers and seas.
From whence do named things come?
From the nameless.
Today, governing all beings,
where do they return?
Back to the nameless.

If rivers and seas lacked streams and valleys,
they would not be full.
If streams and valleys lacked rivers and seas,
they would not flow.
If the nameless lacked the named,
it would not be manifest.
If the named lacked the nameless,
it would not arise.
Rivers and seas are like streams and valleys,
hence they are full.
The named arises from the nameless,
hence it is manifest.

**知人者智 (Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing People)**

This chapter follows the previous,
for the previous clarifies that when the ruler upholds the Dao,
all things naturally submit and serve—
this chapter elucidates the nature of those who submit and serve the ruler who upholds the Dao.

Within this chapter,
three statements about things convey one meaning,
sequentially linked,
therefore divided into four sections.

**First: Knowing Oneself**
Knowing oneself brings clarity.
The bright mirror reflects shapes with purity,
the deep valley receives things with emptiness,
the great artisan molds and refines—
first, he must be cautious of his *镇邹 (zhèn zōu)*—the balance and measure.
Creation differentiates forms,
yet never speaks to mortals.

Thus, knowing that *智 (zhi)* used in confusion with the Dao
leads to loss,
the seven sages drove their chariots in haste,
questioned Shàngchéng but found no answer—
one child sat in contemplation,
gazing at Héyáng while lost in thought.
Yáo and Shùn achieved greatness through *禅让 (chán ràng)*—the Dao’s transmission.
Yān and Qín lost their kingdoms through *争权 (zhēng quán)*—the struggle for power.

Thus, knowing to still *智 (zhi)* and conquer oneself—
who would not find the Dao harmonized?

Knowing others is *智 (zhi)*,
knowing oneself is *明 (míng)*.

**御注**: *智 (zhi)* discerns through effort to comprehend things,
*明 (míng)* illuminates through unity to perceive subtleties—
*智 (zhi)* knows nothing unknown,
*明 (míng)* reveals nothing unseen.

**御疏**: *知 (zhi)*, to recognize and perceive.
When the heart unites with its object,
it is called *生知 (shēng zhī)*—innate knowledge.
The heart of innate knowledge recognizes and perceives past events—
this is called *知法 (zhī fǎ)*—knowing the law.

**成曰**: To perceive past events clearly,
to discern the nature of others—
great or small, profound or shallow—
nothing remains unknown.
To know one’s own past karma and present virtues and vices,
the retributions of the *三代 (sāndài)*—the Three Dynasties—
nothing remains unclear.

**河上公曰**: To know people’s likes and dislikes—
this is *智 (zhi)*.
People can know their own worth and unworthiness—
this is *反听无声 (fǎn tīng wú shēng)*—listening inwardly without sound,
*内视无形 (nèi shì wú xíng)*—gazing inwardly without form—
thus, it is *明 (míng)*.

**荣曰**: To hear and know is called *圣 (shèng)*—sagehood,
to see and know is called *智 (zhi)*—wisdom.
Then, it is difficult to know others externally,
and difficult to know oneself internally.

To discern others and know their virtues and vices—
this is *智 (zhi)*.
To perceive oneself and know one’s gains and losses—
this is *明 (míng)*.

To know virtue is to associate with the virtuous,
like dyeing in fragrant orchids—
to know vice is to distance oneself from the petty,
like avoiding the fishmonger’s stall.
*智 (zhi)* exhaustively obtains loyalty and integrity,
knowing loss removes it through repentance—
this is the true *明智 (míng zhì)*—wisdom and clarity.

If one follows the path of *清重玄 (qīng zhòng xuán)*—pure, weighty, and profound,
and enters the gate of *虚寂 (xū jì)*—emptiness and tranquility—
those who know others recognize that all phenomena are empty,
those who know themselves understand that the self is not permanent—
the self is not permanent,
how then could one internally feed upon name and gain?
»

The myriad phenomena are empty—
what external defilement could cling to sounds and colors?
Inner and outer purity and stillness—
thus it is called *明 (míng)*.

All things and self are unified—
thus it is called *智 (zhi)*.

According to the *Nanhua Jing* [Southern Flower Scripture]:
The Yellow Emperor wandered in the north of the Red River,
ascended Kunlun’s heights,
and gazing southward, returned—
he lost his *玄珠 (xuán zhū)* [Mysterious Pearl].
He sent *智 (Zhì)* to seek it, but he could not find it;
he sent *离朱 (Lí Zhū)* to seek it, but he could not find it;
he sent *契诟 (Qì Gòu)* to seek it, but he could not find it—
then he sent *象罔 (Xiàng Wǎng)*.

*象罔 (Xiàng Wǎng)* obtained it,
and the Yellow Emperor said:
“Strange! *象罔* alone could retrieve it.”
If one employs worldly cleverness and discrimination,
seeking to distinguish right from wrong,
and desires to trace the origin of the Dao—
this has never been heard of.
Only by extinguishing *智 (zhi)* can one grasp the true meaning.

Thus the Scripture says:
*“Not to enlighten the people,
but to let them remain in their simplicity*—
this is its intent.”

---

**Second: Clarity in Self-Mastery**
Self-mastery preserves one’s strength.
He who overcomes others has force,
he who overcomes himself is strong.

**御注 (Yù Zhù):**
One who can subdue others may be called strong in force.
But one who subdues his own heart, rendering it gentle and weak,
can alone preserve his true strength.

**御疏 (Yù Shū):**
He who overcomes others relies on cunning and intelligence to prevail—
such a man may be called strong in force.
He who overcomes himself masters his own heart,
making it gentle and weak—
nothing external can overcome him,
thus he preserves his strength.

Hence the Scripture below says:
*“Guard the gentle, and strength will endure.”*
And again:
*“The gentle overcomes the rigid,
the weak overcomes the strong.”*
Thus, self-mastery is true strength.

**河上公 (Hé Shàng Gōng) says:**
One who excels in talent and skill may merely be strong in force.
But a strong man has his rival.
If he has a rival, his strength and weakness remain undetermined.
Now, to govern emotions with innate nature—
this is self-mastery.
The self-mastered have no external rival.
Without external rivals, they are truly strong.

**荣 (Róng) says:**
He who exerts force—
the greater his strength, the more he overcomes others.
He who cultivates *德 (virtue/power)*—
the higher his virtue, the more he subdues all things.
Advancing the Dao and refining one’s practice,
strengthening oneself without ceasing,
not sinking into error—
this is self-mastery.
The Daoist, forgetting all concerns,
is unharmed by external things—
thus he overcomes others.
With a vacant heart and weak bones, strength endures—
hence the saying: *self-mastery is strength.*

---

**Third: Clarity in Contentment and Resolute Action**
Know contentment to be rich,
strengthen resolve to have purpose.
He who knows sufficiency is wealthy,
he who perseveres has resolve.

**御注 (Yù Zhù):**
He who knows to be content lacks greed—
this is true wealth.
He who strives with unflagging effort is resolute—
this is true purpose.

**御疏 (Yù Shū):**
Contentment lies in the heart.
If the heart knows sufficiency,
there is no greed—
even with coarse food and gourd-drinking,
he stands proud and self-sufficient—
this is wealth.
With unremitting effort and perseverance,
self-aware and self-mastered,
his resolve never wavers—
this is true purpose.

**河上公 (Hé Shàng Gōng) says:**
Strength comes from action.
If a man diligently pursues the Dao,
the Dao responds to him.

**荣 (Róng) says:**
He who knows his place—
though he drinks from a gourd, he is rich.
He who covets gain—
though he hoards a hundred fortunes, he is poor.
Adorning oneself and striving with vigor—
this is resolute action.
Firm faith in the Dao, ever deepening—
this is true purpose.

According to the *Nanhua Jing* [Southern Flower Scripture]:
*Zengzi*, dwelling in Wei, wrapped himself in rags,
his face swollen and emaciated,
his hands and feet calloused,
he went three days without fire,
a decade without new clothes.
His crown’s ribbon frayed,
his sleeves torn to the elbow,
his sandals worn to the heel,
he dragged his feet while singing *Shang* hymns—
his voice filled heaven and earth,
as if struck from metal and stone.
The Son of Heaven could not make him a subject,
the feudal lords could not make him a friend.
Thus, he who nourishes his purpose forgets his form,
he who nourishes his form forgets gain—
this is the meaning of *contentment.*

---

**Fourth: Clarity in Accepting Death with Integrity**
To accept death without forgetting,
to act in accordance with Heaven’s principle—
he who does not lose his place endures,
he who dies without perishing attains longevity.

**御注 (Yù Zhù):**
Knowing contentment and persevering,
never losing one’s place—
this is to endure in the Dao.
Again:
Death is the end of one’s appointed fate,
perishing is the measure of untimely ruin,
longevity is the completion of one’s allotted span.
He who knows others and overcomes them
inevitably invites calamity.
He who knows contentment and perseveres
attains Heaven’s constant way.
He who attains Heaven’s constant way
dies without perishing.
The completion of one’s span—
this is longevity.

**御疏 (Yù Shū):**
Knowing contentment and resolute action—
these are common practices.
If one does not lose his constant way,
he is one who endures in the Dao.
Again:
He who does not lose his place
can endure long.
Again:
Death is the end of one’s appointed fate,
perishing is the measure of untimely ruin,
longevity is the completion of one’s allotted span.
If one submits to Heaven’s harmony,
does not lose the natural flow,
and departs in tranquility,
he completes his allotted span—
this is longevity.
If one is not driven onward,
his vital essence is incomplete—
though *Dan Bao* may have the complexion of an infant,
though *Zhang Yi* may boast noble stature,
if they do not fulfill Heaven’s principle,
how can they be called long-lived?
Thus *Zhuangzi* says:
*“None are longer-lived than the stillborn child,
while Pengzu is counted as untimely.”*

**河上公 (Hé Shàng Gōng) says:**
If a man regulates himself,
does not lose his place,
and cherishes Heaven’s vital essence,
he can endure long.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Chapter on the Great Dao**
This chapter follows the previous one,
for the earlier text illuminated the sovereign who serves the Dao—
one who knows himself and masters himself.
This chapter reveals how to accomplish and magnify great deeds,
all for the sake of the Dao, forgetting merit.

Within this gate, it is divided into three sections:
First, it marks *“The Great Dao is vast”*—
showing that left and right have no boundaries.
Second, *“Merit accomplished, not possessed”*—
illustrating that great and small cannot be named.
Third, *“The Sage does not prize his body”*—
to preserve the brilliance of great deeds.

**First: Marking *“The Great Dao is vast”*—
showing that left and right have no constraints.**

The Four Sovereigns reside in eminence,
one as their leader.
The enlightened guide their vision,
the wise devise their plans.
Seated in majesty at the Purple Palace,
they act without action and find fulfillment.
How much more so the Great Dao—
vast and boundless,
providing for all things and nurturing life.
The River Above True Person soars on the hundred-zhang clouds,
the Huai Mountain Immortal chews the autumn *dan* osmanthus,
the Celestial Lord pays homage to *Ge Xuan* in the waters,
and the Han Emperor meets the Celestial Official on the cloud path—
thus it is known:
It can be to the left or to the right—
this is what is meant.

**The Great Dao is boundless—
it can be to the left or to the right.**
*Commentary (御注):*
The Great Dao is boundless—
unconstrained yet responsive to all things,
left and right without partiality.

*Explanatory Commentary (御疏):*
"Boundless" describes its unconstrained nature.
The Dao is neither yin nor yang,
neither soft nor hard—
boundless and unrestrained,
responding to all phenomena,
capable of left or right,
without partiality.
Thus *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The Dao has never had boundaries."*

*River Master (河上公) says:*
"Boundless" speaks of the Dao’s unfettered flow—
vast and floating, like presence and absence,
visible yet elusive, spoken yet divergent,
exhausting all yet never inadequate,
lying in human use—
thus it encompasses all within and without,
left and right alike,
so it is said: *It can be to the left or to the right—
yet cannot be confined to left or right.*

All things rely on it for life without complaint.
*Explanatory Commentary:*
All things under Heaven depend on the Great Dao’s generative power
to fulfill their nature,
yet the Dao’s transformation is wondrous and heartless—
though things rely on it for life,
the Dao does not weary of the labor.

*Alternative Explanation:*
Things do not reject the Dao.

*River Master says:*
"Rely" means "depend upon,"
"complaint" means "avoidance."
Things truly depend on the Perfect Dao for their formation,
yet the Dao forms them without avoidance.

---
**Second: When deeds are complete, one does not claim them—
illuminating the difficulty of naming small or great.**

Deeds are complete yet not claimed as one’s own.
*Commentary:*
Things rely on the Dao’s spontaneous action for their transformation,
yet the Dao does not weary of the labor,
its functions fully realized—
it does not claim them as its own.

*Explanatory Commentary:*
"Deeds" refers to the generative function.
The Great Dao’s work of nurturing life is complete,
yet it does not regard the things it creates as its own.

*Alternative Explanation:*
Though the Dao’s creation is complete,
its deeds, though complete, are never claimed—
this is the forgetting of deeds.

*Further Explanation:*
It transforms all beings,
its subtle work silently accomplished,
yet the merit is attributed to the things themselves—
thus it does not claim deeds or names.

---
It cherishes all things yet does not rule them,
constantly without desire—
this is what makes it *not* small.
*Commentary:*
It nurtures all things yet does not dominate them;
toward things, it has no desire—
thus it can be called *not* small.

*Explanatory Commentary:*
This is a rhetorical inversion.
To say "it can be called small"
is to say it *cannot* be called small.
The Dao generates and nurtures all things to maturity
without ruling over them,
clothing and covering all things,
yet without desire—
how could this be the Dao’s narrowness?
Thus, to say "it can be called small"
is to say it *cannot* be called small.

*Further Explanation:*
"Clothing and covering" means nurturing.
Though it nurtures all things,
it conceals its virtue and hides its name,
serene and formless,
thus not ruling—
though it seems minute,
by this reasoning, it is *not* small.

---
All things return to it yet it does not rule—
this is what makes it *not* great.
*Commentary:*
It cherishes them, so all things return to it;
though there are myriad differences among things,
it does not rule—
thus it can be called *not* great.
To say it cannot be called great
is neither small nor great—
thus it is difficult to name.

*Explanatory Commentary:*
"All things return to it" refers to the Dao’s generative function.
Though all things return to the Dao,
the Dao does not rule—
how could this not be vast and great?
Thus it is said: *It can be called great.*

---
Since it can be to the left or to the right,
it is neither small nor great—
thus it is difficult to name.

*Commentary:*
There are myriad differences among things—
this is from *Zhuangzi*.

*Further Explanation:*
The Dao can grow and nurture things,
like the great sea or vast valleys—
though things return to it,
it does not rule over them.
Since it does not rule,
can it be called great?
Thus it cannot be called great.

---
**Third: The Sage does not prize his body—
to preserve the brilliance of great deeds.**

Thus the Sage never claims greatness,
and so achieves greatness.

*Commentary:*
Therefore, the Sage follows the Dao and forgets deeds,
never seeking his own brilliance,
and so accomplishes his great deeds.

*Explanatory Commentary:*
The Sage who governs the world
spreads virtue and bestows benefits,
establishing pure winds and transforming customs,
things thus flourishing—
following the Dao and forgetting deeds,
not exalting himself,
and so accomplishes his great deeds.

*Further Explanation:*
The Sage embodies the Dao,
forgets self to cherish others,
quiet and retiring, humble and yielding,
never claiming greatness—
only prioritizing others over self,
forgetting deeds and greatness,
thus becoming the leader of all sages,
solely honored in the Three Realms,
and accomplishing greatness.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: The Great Symbol**
*Why this chapter follows:*
The previous chapter spoke of boundless, benefit-giving action,
forgetting deeds—
thus this chapter follows,
revealing that those who forget deeds
are where all things turn.
Within this chapter, the text has three layers:
First, it clarifies that all things return to it for benefit,
Second, it uses the analogy of bait to illustrate
the subtle, ineffable principle of teaching,
Third, it shows that it is neither form nor sound,
yet its wondrous use is inexhaustible.

---
**First: Clarifying that all things return for benefit.**

The Five Peaks manifest their forms,
with Tai Mountain as the longest.
The Three Powers establish their ranks,
with the Sage Ruler in eminence.
When the halter is held, all eyes follow;
when the pivot is grasped, all directions align—
this is *holding the Great Symbol*.
Under Heaven, all return to it.
Its virtue of emptiness and forgetting is vast,
its seated teachings are great—
how could it compare to
Yang Spring’s White Snow,
or *Ying* melodies performed in vain,
or red bait luring fish without substance?
Thus it is known:
The flavor of profound speech is subtle,
yet common scholars embrace it without understanding;
the resonance of the golden bell is pure,
yet fools seek it and rarely find it.
If not for those who hold the Great Symbol,
who else could embody it?

「Holding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven come forth.  *[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  When the Sage Ruler upholds the Great Dao, to govern all under Heaven, all things return and follow.*

*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  This speaks of the ruler holding the Great Dao to govern all under Heaven—without action or affairs, things flourish in their natural order.  Observing the sun and winds, all return to the Dao, thus it is said that all under Heaven come forth.*

*River Master said:  "Holding" means guarding.  "Symbol" is the Dao/Way.  The Sage guards the Great Dao, and thus all people under Heaven turn their hearts and follow.*

*Rong said:  The Great Symbol is formless, the formless being the vast and empty Dao.  "Holding" means to focus and uphold oneself within the realm of profound virtue, to concentrate one’s heart at the gate of quiet seclusion.  When one follows the Dao, all things return, hence it is said that all under Heaven come forth.*

*[Master] Cheng’s commentary:  "Holding" means upholding, yet this is not holding while holding—it is upholding without upholding anything.  The Great Symbol is like the great Dao’s law and image, that is, the Sage from the previous chapter who upholds the formless Symbol, always skillfully rescuing all things.  Thus, all under Heaven come forth and follow.  The *Zhuangzi* says:  "The Sage stands without instruction, sits without discussion, emptiness brings forth, fullness returns—Confucius would lead all under Heaven to follow him."  This is the same.  When all come forth without harm, peace and tranquility prevail.*

*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  When the Sage Ruler upholds the Great Dao, all under Heaven come forth and follow, just as when a household has music and food, passing travelers will stop and stay.  This is a metaphor.*

*River Master said:  "Bait" is beauty.  The passing traveler is one and the same—if one can find beauty and joy in the Dao, then they will stop and stay.  "One" means to depart from excess and dwell in emptiness, drifting like a passing traveler.*

*Rong said:  The five tones of music are the "bait" of joy.  The eight delicacies of food are the "bait" of taste.  A hundred years of life is but a passing traveler.  "Stop" means to linger, to depend.  To return and follow the Dao, one may attain peace and tranquility.  But if beings do not awaken, few will remain—only those who fix their hearts on strings and pipes, using them to indulge their emotions, or who cling to orchids and cassia, relying on these for comfort, cannot uphold the Symbol.  To seek tranquility is difficult indeed.*

*[Master] Cheng’s commentary:  Music is the tones of strings and pipes, the five notes of *guan, shang, jiao, zhi, yu*.  Bait is the savor of food and drink.  Music has pleasing sounds, bait has flavors to delight in—thus even transient travelers, upon encountering them, will stop and linger in love.  The Dao’s utterance is subtle, without taste—*

*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  When the Sage Ruler upholds the Great Dao, to govern all under Heaven, all things return and follow.  The governance is without form, yet its efficacy is boundless.*

*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  The Sage upholds the Great Dao, and thus all under Heaven’s people turn their hearts and follow.  Governing oneself without harming clarity, then the body is at peace and longevity is assured.*

*Rong said:  When the misty clouds spread and all things are nourished, when the fragrant rains descend and every plant thrives—this is but the benefit of the Dao’s embrace, without harm.  The principle of non-harm: how does it manifest in governance?  When body and spirit remain undisturbed, there is ease; when life and death are indistinct, there is tranquility; when all is harmoniously interconnected, there is great peace.*

*[Master] Cheng’s commentary:  "Tranquility" is greatness.  When the common folk come to the Sage’s dwelling, all gain benefit without harm.  The benefit they gain is the peace and greatness of the teachings of the Mahayana.  Non-harm reveals the skillful means of suffering; peace and tranquility speak of harmony and delight.*

*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  The Dao’s transformation is without action, subtle and balanced—neither the scrutiny of harsh laws nor the display of ostentatious decrees.  Thus, it is not seen or heard, yet its pure influence prevails, and each year there is abundance.  The governance is harmonious and flourishing, all things grow and thrive, the myriad beings radiant and complete.  Hence its efficacy cannot be exhausted.*

*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  The Dao’s governance is subtle and balanced, neither the scrutiny of harsh laws nor the display of ostentatious decrees.  Thus, it is not seen or heard, yet each year there is abundance, the pure winds harmonious and unrestrained.  All that moves and grows flourishes, the myriad beings radiant and complete—hence its efficacy cannot be exhausted.*

*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  The Dao’s governance is subtle and balanced, neither the scrutiny of harsh laws nor the display of ostentatious decrees.  Thus, it is not seen or heard, yet each year there is abundance, the pure winds harmonious and unrestrained.  All that moves and grows flourishes, the myriad beings radiant and complete—hence its efficacy cannot be exhausted.*

*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  The Dao’s governance is subtle and balanced, neither the scrutiny of harsh laws nor the display of ostentatious decrees.  Thus, it is not seen or heard, yet each year there is abundance, the pure winds harmonious and unrestrained.  All that moves and grows flourishes, the myriad beings radiant and complete—hence its efficacy cannot be exhausted.*

The Great Symbol is invisible when gazed upon,
inaudible when listened to,
yet its efficacy is boundless.
*[The Great Symbol] is the Dao/Way.  When the Dao/Way is upheld to still the mind, there are no words or teachings at first—thus it is invisible when gazed upon, inaudible when listened to.  Yet the pure winds spread widely, all things harmonious and tranquil, with abundance each year—thus its efficacy is boundless.*

*Exhausted* means *complete*.  The Dao’s transformation is without action, subtle and balanced—neither the scrutiny of harsh laws nor the display of ostentatious decrees.  Thus, it is invisible when gazed upon, inaudible when listened to.  Yet each year there is abundance, the pure winds harmonious and unrestrained.  All that moves and grows flourishes, the myriad beings radiant and complete—hence its efficacy cannot be exhausted.*

The Master of the Yellow River said:
*"To gaze upon it is not to see"*—*"see"* means *to obtain*. The Dao is formless; unlike the five colors—blue, red, white, black, and yellow—it cannot be grasped by sight. *"To listen to it is not to hear"*—the Dao is unlike the five tones—*gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*—which can be heard by the ear. *"Its use cannot be exhausted"*—when the Dao is applied to govern a state, the nation grows wealthy and the people flourish; when applied to cultivate the self, life is prolonged without end.

Honor said: *"Exhausted"* means *complete*. What is visible to the eye is dazzled by hues of green and yellow; what the ear hears is deceived by tones of *gong* and *zhi*; what the heart covets is blinded by treasures and riches. Though treasures serve utility, their use is finite. Though sounds may please, the deaf remain distant. Though colors may charm, the blind are near. Thus, one who knows to cease indulging in pleasures finds rest.

Yet the Dao of tranquility and non-action—though unseen by the eye—governs with penetrating clarity, though unheard by the ear—discerns with profound acuity. Though the mind cannot fathom it, those attuned to it act without depletion. The common and the Daoist differ thus; those bound by gain and harm are as such.

Master Cheng’s commentary:
*"To gaze upon it is not to see"*—the Supreme Dao is profound and mysterious, transcending form and color, unlike food and drink, which cannot be sought through mere visual perception. *"To listen to it is not to hear"*—the Great Sound is subtle beyond tone, its essence not like *gong* or *jiao*; it is not grasped by the ears as bells and drums are. The words of the Sage, though spoken, are but examples of their meaning. *"Its use cannot be exhausted"*—*"exhausted"* means *complete*. The words of the Supreme Dao are serene and boundless, neither sound nor color, transcending sight and hearing. Like a mirror’s heart, it reflects all that comes; like a valley’s echo, it responds as it is stirred. Thus, the use of the Dao, though seemingly without action, is inexhaustible.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: "When One Would Contract It"**
This chapter follows the previous one, which expounds on the Great Sage’s forgetfulness of merit as the refuge of all things. It now reveals the Sage’s use of expedient means in forgetfulness of merit.

The Sage adapts to myriad paths; the responses are not singular. Sometimes, following the circumstances, they teach lesser doctrines; sometimes, arousing aspiration, they expound the Great Vehicle. Thus, there are true and expedient bodies, real and expedient wisdom. They employ expedient means to honor inferior disciples and uphold the real to guide superior ones. Within expedient and real, there are distinctions of superiority and inferiority. This chapter briefly elucidates this meaning.

Within this chapter, three distinctions unfold:
1. The expedient Dao benefits beings, expanding the paths of governance.
2. Measuring the two wisdoms, it clarifies that expedient does not surpass the real.
3. It demonstrates that the expedient Dao cannot be revealed to all.

**First: The expedient Dao benefits beings, expanding the paths of governance.**
The Great Dao governs all actions, yet the foolish calculate in vain—like one drinking from the river on the verge of death, wearying in futile pursuit of the sun. To absorb dew and preserve life, one rejoices in the hope of ascending to the clouds. Spring’s fragrance and summer’s lushness unfold in their seasons; rain disperses, clouds gather, and the seven celestial officials align. Sometimes, reversal brings harmony, illustrating the sage’s clear laws. Sometimes, transformation renews, teaching the virtuous to retreat quietly.

What of the blind? Though ignorant, they linger in the gates of affection and desire, inevitably losing the realm of stillness. Like a fish escaping water or a sharp blade shown to all, such common beings—how can their lamentations be exhausted?

When one would contract it, they must first fully expand it.

The Way that would contract must first fully expand it.
The Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it.
The Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it.
The Way that would take must first fully give it.
This is called **subtle luminosity**.

**Commentary:** The Classic says: *"Upright speech seems contrary."* The *Yijing* says: *"Diverge to exercise authority."* Authority is that which, though contrary to the Way, aligns with principle.

Thus, the sage exercises authority while valuing alignment with principle, while the petty man uses it for deceit and guile. Confucius said: *"One may stand with him, but not yet exercise authority with him—truly so."* Therefore, the Old Master in the previous chapter spoke of holding the Great Image—this is called **substance**. This chapter follows with contraction—this is called **authority**.

Measuring the roots of sentient beings, he thus covers and reverses with substance and authority, compelling them to reach the realm of nature and life. Yet the deluded claim this is not the Dao’s intent—how deeply they err and fail to awaken!

When one would contract the emotions of sentient beings, first expand them, exhausting their extravagant desires, so that they become ensnared in love and lust—then contraction follows. The meanings of strength and weakness are similarly applied.

This Dao is most subtle, yet its effects are clearly manifest—hence, it is called **subtle luminosity**.

**Exegesis:** *Teru* (合) means to contract. This reveals the Sage’s use of authority to transform and guide sentient beings.

Since people have dull and sharp roots, and teaching has both authority and substance, the Sage measures the roots of sentient beings. Thus, with authority and substance, he covers and reverses, revealing the truth: sharp-rooted beings, seeing virtue, turn toward it; having faults, they contract. A slight demonstration suffices to reach their depths. Dull-rooted beings, long mired in delusion, unless transformed through authority, cannot be led to return. Therefore, when contracting the emotions of those who would expand them, first expand them, exhausting their extravagant desires—then they will naturally contract.

The meanings of strength and weakness are likewise so. Extend this principle, and none will fail.

At first hearing, one may take this as contrary to the Dao, but upon deep understanding, the purpose of authority and substance becomes clear. Hence the commentary: *"The sage exercises authority while valuing alignment with principle; the petty man uses it for deceit and guile."* The following text further states that it should not be shown to others—precisely because authority is so difficult to wield.

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
The Way that would contract must first fully expand it—first expanding it is to exhaust their licentiousness.
The Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it—first strengthening them is to make them suffer calamity.
The Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it—first elevating them is to make them proud and perilous.
The Way that would take must first fully give it—first giving it is to exhaust their greedy hearts.
This is called **subtle luminosity**—these four methods are subtle in their Dao, yet their effects are clearly manifest.

**Yan** said:
These four methods show that when the Sage is extinguished, virtue naturally arises; when wisdom is abandoned, transformation naturally proceeds; contracting the hearts of all under Heaven while making them expand; weakening the resolve of all under Heaven while making them strong.

**Rong** said:
The Way that would contract must first fully expand it—when one would close the *Gui* (兑) and shut the door, the foolish do not comply. Thus, one opens the *Gui* and accomplishes the matter, exhausting them until they cease.
The Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it—when one would still their fierce and mighty hearts, one indulges their rigid resolve. The weak perish, the strong endure—suffering reaches its limit and must stop.
The Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it—when one would decay, it instead flourishes; things reach their extreme and naturally reverse.
The Way that would take must first fully give it—when one would take away evil, if evil deeds are not removed, evil accumulates and destroys the self. Only then do they awaken in the moment.

This is called **subtle luminosity**—though the Sage’s authority seems at first unlike teaching, upon examining its principle, it holds profound potential, most subtly luminous and clearly beneficial. Hence, it is called **subtle luminosity**.

In eighty-one chapters, the transformations and guidance are broadly expounded, yet common emotions cling, and their grasp differs. When substance is demonstrated and they do not comply, authority is used to transform them, compelling them to return.

The Mysterious Teaching is profound and far-reaching, fitting for all. Authority is explained first, substance clarified afterward. To contract, one opens the Way’s transformation; to weaken worldly emotions, one strengthens their immortal essence; to abandon evil intent, one offers the true path; to take away evil deeds, one gives them virtuous conduct.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
The Way that would contract must first fully expand it—*teru* (歙) means to gather, to contract. When exercising authority to transform all classes of beings, those who would not be contracted by substance must first be expanded and indulged, their licentiousness exhausted—then they may be contracted.

In the past, when the Old Master entered the west to transform the barbarians of *Jibin*, he first indulged their savagery, then transformed them with the Dao—this is the case. The intricate details are fully recorded in the *Wen Shi Nei Zhuan*.

The Way that would weaken must first fully strengthen it—when one would lead them to the Dao’s gentle weakness, one must first exhaust their strength, then demonstrate the yielding and soft.

The Way that would abandon must first fully elevate it—when one would abandon their brutal and untamed nature, one must first indulge their ferocity and violence. Once their violence is exhausted, it can be abandoned. This is as when the barbarian king unleashed his poisonous wrath, burning and drowning the Old Master—yet water and fire did not harm him—only then did he teach him the Dao.

The Way that would take must first fully give it—first indulging their evil, calling it "giving," then leading them to goodness, calling it "taking." Thus, the Old Master first displayed his mundane form to indulge their rigidity, then revealed his divine powers—only then did the barbarians submit, allowing their ferocity to be taken away and leading them to the virtuous path.

These four paired meanings are similarly structured, differing only in shallow and deep layers. Those of superior capacity hear substance and immediately awaken; those of inferior roots require authority. This is the method of increasing the law and eliminating delusion.

This is called **subtle luminosity**—though the Sage’s authority is subtle and profound, its effects are clearly verified.

「Again it is said: *微隐* means subtle and hidden; *明*, wisdom. This is the subtle and hidden Way of wisdom.

**The Second Section** explains the comparison of two kinds of wisdom: the wisdom of the Way is not inferior to that of authority. The gentle overcomes the rigid.

**御注** states: The *巽* (compliant) can wield authority, and when authority is wielded, it can control all things. Hence, it is known that the gentle and compliant can indeed overcome the rigid and strong.

**御疏** elaborates: The *易* (Classic of Changes) says: *"巽以行权"* (The compliant can wield authority). If one desires to clarify that *巽* (compliant) is humble and yielding, then one can practice the Way of authority. Therefore, to make something *翕* (converge), one must first give it *张* (expansion); to make it *弱* (weak), one must first give it *强* (strength). Ultimately, when one leads it to *翕弱* (convergence and weakness), it is the Way of gentleness triumphing over rigidity and strength. Hence, it is said: *The gentle overcomes the rigid.*

**河上公** states: *The gentle endure long, while the rigid perish first.*

**荣** says: The Way of authority follows without resistance, hence it is called *gentle*. Yet it must ultimately control the rigid, hence it is said to *overcome*.

**成疏** explains: *Gentle* refers to the true Way; *rigid*, to the wisdom of authority. To teach those difficult to convert, one must rely on the wisdom of authority. When comparing the two wisdoms, the true wisdom of the Way surpasses that of authority.

**The Third Section** illustrates through analogies that the Way of authority cannot be revealed to all.

*A fish cannot be removed from its depths; the state’s sharpest tools should not be displayed to the people.*
**御注** clarifies: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. The *利器* (sharpest tools) refers to the Way of authority. This states that the Way of authority cannot be revealed to those unworthy of it, hence the analogy: *If a fish loses its pool, it will be captured by men. If the Way of authority is revealed to those unworthy, they will seize it and use it for deception.*

**御疏** further elucidates: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. The *利器* (sharpest tools) refers to the Way of authority. A fish in water is like a ruler wielding authority; a fish losing its water is like a ruler losing his authority, and then he will be captured. If the Way of authority is falsely revealed to those unworthy, they will misuse it and practice deception.*

**河上公** says: *A fish cannot be removed from its depths*—if a fish is removed from its depths, it is like losing rigidity and gaining gentleness, and thus can no longer control. *The state’s sharpest tools should not be displayed to the people*—the sharpest tools refer to the Way of authority. Those who wield authority in governing the state should not reveal it to their ministers, nor should those who practice the Way reveal it to those unworthy of it.*

**荣** says: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. A fish swims in the river and lake, relying on them for its livelihood. The Sage’s greatest treasure depends on the subtle and hidden Way of authority. A fish cannot lose its water, for losing it means the fish perishes. The sharpest tools should not be displayed to the people, for revealing them brings peril. Hence it is said: *One can lead people by the Way, but not make them know it*—this shows that the Way of authority must not be entrusted to the wrong hands.

**成疏** concludes: *脱* (removed) means *lost*. The *利器* (sharpest tools) refers to authority. A fish hides in water, and authority hides in the heart, so nothing can harm it. A fish loses its water and is captured by others; authority revealed to the people is controlled by them. Hence, it cannot be done.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Way is Ever Without Action**

This chapter marks the third section of the text, clarifying the ultimate convergence.

Within this chapter, the text opens two distinct themes: the first converges the essence of the Way, revealing its tranquil stillness while ever in motion; the second converges the essence of the student, displaying the profound mystery of the highest subtlety.

**The First Convergence: The Essence of the Way—Revealing Tranquility While Ever in Motion**

The wondrous Way of non-action is exalted and detached from worldly affairs, not enduring forever, yet dwelling in obscurity is not dim. The radiant virtue encompasses all life, working unceasingly yet unperceived. The profound roots remain silent, yet all things resonate with it—who can discern? Unlocking the hidden depths of the jade-like treasury, the celestial scriptures ascend to the *上清* (Upper Purity) and *太清* (Supreme Purity). Manifesting the teachings of the jade cabinet, the realms of *罪福* (guilt and fortune) span the *三涂* (Three Stygian Realms) and *九夜* (Nine Nights of Torment). The lonely spirits wail along the *泉路* (path to the underworld), while the stagnant *魄* (ethereal souls) languish in the *苦庭* (court of suffering). Without the great Way to deliver them, who can rescue the lost and bring forth clarity? Though called profound and silent, yet nothing is left undone—teaching the common folk, the power of the Way is now revealed.

The Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. If rulers could uphold it, all things would transform naturally.

**御注** states: The wondrous origin is pure and tranquil, hence it is ever without action. All things depend on it for existence, yet nothing is left undone—thus all things transform naturally. The ruler’s non-action leads to the people’s simplicity and purity.

**御疏** elaborates: The Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. The nature of the Way is pure and tranquil, its wondrous origin serene and still—hence it is ever without action. All things rely on it for creation, responding with sensation when moved—hence nothing is left undone. Those who act will inevitably have things they cannot do; those who do not act will have nothing they cannot accomplish. If rulers uphold it, all things will transform naturally. Rulers who guard the pure and tranquil Way, without action or affairs, will see all things naturally respond and transform. The people will then become simple and virtuous through their ruler’s good teaching.

**河上公** says: The Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. The Way’s constancy lies in its non-action. If rulers uphold it, all things will transform naturally. This means that if rulers guard the Way, all things will transform in accordance with it.

**成疏** explains: The Way is ever without action, yet nothing remains undone. The Way of constancy is silent and tranquil, yet its application arises spontaneously to respond to all things. The earlier sentence is the origin; the later, its manifestation. This reveals that though the Way’s origin is profound and silent, its motion is tranquil and responsive—clarifying the interplay of motion and stillness.

If rulers uphold it, all things will transform naturally. The sovereigns of the *万乘* (ten-thousand chariots) and the five ranks of rulers, if they uphold this Way, will see the *八荒* (eight remote regions) and all nations naturally follow and transform. Students are the same. The reason for emphasizing rulers is that their transformation benefits many and spreads widely.

**The Second Convergence: The Essence of the Student—Displaying the Profound Mystery of the Highest Subtlety**

When one seeks to act after transformation, I will restrain them with the nameless simplicity.

**御注** states: This speaks of those who, having followed their ruler’s transformation through the Way of non-action, now wish to act with worldly deeds. I will restrain them with the nameless simplicity.

**The Second Convergence: The Essence of the Student—Displaying the Profound Mystery of the Highest Subtlety (Continued)**

The nameless simplicity is the Dao.

**御疏** states: The nameless simplicity is the Dao. Those who wish to act are those who desire to engage in worldly deeds. *吾* refers to the rulers themselves. It means that once people have received the benevolent teachings and been transformed, the ruler’s virtue of non-action brings purity and stillness. Yet if they still wish to act and engage in worldly deeds, I will restrain them with the nameless simplicity, so that their hearts remain pure and undisturbed by such desires.

**河上公** says: *吾* means the self. The nameless simplicity refers to the Dao. After all things have been transformed, if one then seeks to engage in clever artifices, the rulers must govern and pacify them with virtue and the Dao.

**成疏** states: *作* means to begin cultivation. *朴* is the Dao. It speaks of those who, having first followed the transformation and begun cultivation, inevitably harbor desires for fruition and rewards. Once these desires arise, one must use the nameless, simple Dao to calm their hearts, so that they do not cling to worldly attachments. This is the way of dispelling the worldly with emptiness.

The nameless simplicity will also not desire. Without desire, there is stillness, and the world will naturally align in harmony.

**御注** states: Once the ruler has restrained the people with the nameless simplicity, one must not cling to this nameless simplicity and leave traces behind. Otherwise, people may seek these traces and lose their original nature, falling back into worldly action. Thus, even this nameless simplicity must be forgotten—without desire, one forgets desire. In tranquil purity, the world will naturally align in harmony.

**御疏** states: The nameless simplicity will also not desire. Earlier, it was said that even if common people desire to engage in worldly deeds, the ruler will restrain them with the nameless simplicity. Now, it is said that even this nameless simplicity should not desire. This is to prevent the ruler from clinging to the nameless simplicity, lest they awaken desires in the people, leading them to seek traces and lose their original nature, thereby returning to worldly action. Such desires would be equal and indistinguishable.

Thus, initially, the nameless simplicity is used to restrain the desires of the people. Once the people’s desires are eliminated, the sage’s own nameless simplicity is also abandoned. It is like medicine used to treat an illness—once the sickness is cured, the medicine is forgotten; or a boat used to cross water—once the crossing is complete, the boat is left behind. If one guards the boat after crossing the water or continues to take medicine after the illness is gone, not only will they fail to reach the other shore, but they may also incur new suffering. Without desire, there is stillness, and the world will naturally align in harmony. When the nameless simplicity no longer desires, the desire for it is also forgotten, leading to tranquil purity—this is called *了出* (realization and transcendence).

The ruler governs through non-action, and the people follow their nature and transform from below. Without the need for teaching or commands, the world becomes peaceful and harmonious. Hence, it is said that the world will naturally align in harmony.

**河上公** says: The nameless simplicity will also not desire. The ruler governs and pacifies with virtue and the Dao, and yet the ruler should also not desire. Therefore, one must transform them with the pure Dao.

The world will naturally align in harmony for those who can do this.

**成疏** states: The nameless simplicity will also not desire, not merely refraining from desire for worldly laws but also from desire for this nameless simplicity itself. Earlier, it was said to dispel worldly attachments with emptiness; now, it is said to dispel the emptiness with worldly existence. With both worldly and emptiness forgotten, one attains the Dao.

Without desire, there is stillness, and the world will naturally align in harmony. Stillness is cessation. Earlier, worldly attachments were dispelled with the nameless simplicity; now, the desire for it is dispelled with non-desire. When worldly attachments and emptiness are both forgotten, desire is eliminated, and one attains the Dao. This is the process of dispelling again and again, the profound within the profound—what is called *探幽索隐，穷理尽性* (probing the depths and seeking the hidden, exhausting principle and attaining nature).

Since all dharmas are ultimately true and real, ladders, scaffolding, and all contrivances are none other than the highest Dao. Therefore, it is said that the world will naturally align in harmony. This sentence seals the gate of all profound mysteries.

**End of Volume Ten of the *Moral and Mysterious Classic*—Commentary on the *Profound Virtue***
**Beginning of Volume Eleven of the *Moral and Mysterious Classic*—Commentary on the *Profound Virtue***

**Commentary on the *Profound Virtue* – Chapter Thirty-Eight: *Upper Virtue Does Not Virtue***

**Imperial Commentary and Exegesis of the Tang Xuanzong**
**Commentary by Lord Yan Junping of He Shang, Li Rong**
**Exegesis by Master Cheng Xuan of Xihua**
**Compiled by Qiang Sici of Mengyang**

The *Dao De Jing* is divided into two volumes: the upper text elucidates the *Dao*, the lower text expounds on *virtue*. Yet the upper text also encompasses both *Dao* and *virtue*, though it prioritizes *Dao* as the primary and *virtue* as secondary. Similarly, the lower text also encompasses both, but here *virtue* takes precedence while *Dao* becomes secondary. Thus, the text is structured as *Dao De Jing* (Classic of the *Dao* and *Virtue*), with *Dao* and *virtue* as its twin pillars.

This single scroll comprises forty-two chapters, its meaning branching into three distinct divisions:
The first chapter establishes the foundation of *virtue*,
Chapters two through forty-two expound extensively on the principles of *virtue*,
The final chapter synthesizes the preceding teachings.

**First Division: Establishing the Foundation of *Virtue***

Within this chapter, four further distinctions unfold:
1. Distinguishing the *virtue* of the upper and lower realms, dispelling erroneous fixation,
2. Clarifying the *virtue* of *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), and *li* (rites), illustrating the shift from purity to corruption across ages,
3. Exposing the superficiality of later developments, urging a return to the root,
4. Denouncing *li* (rites) as the origin of hollow pretense, guiding proper discernment and alignment.

**1. Distinguishing the *Virtue* of the Upper and Lower Realms, Dispelling Erroneous Fixation**

Indeed, *yi* (righteousness) is subordinate to *Dao*, while *Dao* holds supreme dignity. The transformations of Tang and Yu were pure and beautiful, their governance rooted in *wuwei* (non-action), their realm a field of spontaneous harmony where none boasted of virtue or sought praise. They harmonized with the purity of Heaven and Earth, steadied the rectitude of sun and moon. In their midst, things flourished without effort, their actions costing nothing—truly, *upper virtue does not virtue*.

Mysterious beyond measure, yet humble and radiant, their *Dao* aligned with the first of the Three Sovereigns. Though they acted, they remained still. When the age of Lu Lu (the legendary era of simplicity) faded, the practice of *li* (rites) and *ren* (benevolence) emerged. As corruption spread, laws became rigid, and the *Dao* of the two *Zhuans* (ancient officials) was abandoned. The wise and sagely grew obscured, and Ji Chang (King Wen of Zhou) suffered seven years of misfortune—yet he never forgot that *yi* (righteousness) was subordinate to *Dao*. Thus, he endured poverty while dwelling in splendor, losing the subtlety of the whole. Even the foolish failed to discern this.

**Upper virtue does not virtue, and thus it possesses virtue.**
**Imperial Commentary:**
*Upper virtue does not virtue, and thus it possesses virtue.*
*Lower virtue does not lose virtue, and thus it lacks virtue.*
*Virtue* is the manifestation of the *Dao*.
As *Zhuangzi* says: *"When things attain their natural state, it is called virtue."*
In ancient times, the pure and unadorned *virtue* was not yet manifest, and thus there was no *virtue* to be named—hence, *"does not virtue."* Yet the pure *virtue* did not disperse; through *wuwei*, its influence remained clear—hence, *"and thus it possesses virtue."*

When *virtue* declined, its functions became more pronounced. Though the heart still embodied the *Dao*, its actions leaned toward *wei* (action). *Virtue* could now be named—hence, *"does not lose virtue."* Yet because its traces leaned toward ostentation, it was coarser than the upper—hence, *"and thus it lacks virtue."*

**Imperial Exegesis:**
*Upper* refers to the ancient age.
*Virtue* is the manifestation of *Dao*.
In the upper antiquity, pure and unadorned, *wuwei* governed all. The essence of the *Dao* was its foundation, and all things flourished naturally—this was the pure *virtue* of antiquity, hence *"upper virtue."* Yet its *virtue* was so profound that none could name it—hence, *"does not virtue."* Yet the harmonious winds prevailed, and all things thrived—*virtue* remained complete—hence, *"and thus it possesses virtue."*

**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**
*Upper virtue does not virtue*—*upper virtue* refers to the sovereigns of the most ancient era, whose *virtue* was so vast that names could not contain it. *"Does not virtue"* means they did not govern through *virtue* but followed nature spontaneously, nurturing life—thus their *virtue* was unseen, hence *"does not virtue."* *"And thus it possesses virtue"* signifies that their *virtue* aligned with Heaven and Earth, and the harmonious *qi* flowed, allowing the people to thrive.

**Commentary by Li Rong:**
The ancient *Dao* was established in the boundless void as its heart, its essence condensed into unity. It required no effort to transform all things, nor did it seek the names of courtesy—how could there be conflict with arms? Though it resided at the pinnacle, it was neither contentious nor named. *Wuwei* was its nature—hence, *"upper virtue."* It acted without reliance, achieved without claiming—hence, *"does not virtue."* It nourished all things, allowing them to flourish—hence, *"and thus it possesses virtue."* Internally, it illuminated *virtue* in harmony with the *Dao*, its meaning thus worthy of reverence—hence, *"upper virtue."* The *Dao* was formless, *virtue* was subtle—its light was concealed, its use was hidden—hence, *"does not virtue."* Though concealed in use, its use was indeed use; though hidden in light, its light was indeed light. With use and light manifest, it benefited all—hence, *"and thus it possesses virtue."*

**Exegesis by Master Cheng Xuan:**
*Upper* signifies transcendence and excellence—it is the name for what surpasses. *Virtue* means attainment, its meaning rooted in mastery. Those of *upper virtue* subtly align with the *Dao*, their wisdom merging with reality, transcending gain and loss. Thus, *"does not virtue."* Their wisdom merges with reality—thus, *"and thus it possesses virtue."* When *virtue* is present, loss is dispelled; when *virtue* is absent, gain is dispelled.

**Lower virtue does not lose virtue, and thus it lacks virtue.**
**Imperial Exegesis:**
This speaks of the decline of pure winds and the waning of *virtue*. Thus, the Sage praised the spirit of *wuwei*, yet the people clung to its traces. To cling to traces is inferior—hence, *"lower virtue."* When traces became manifest, *virtue* could be named—hence, *"does not lose virtue."* Though *virtue* was named, its traces leaned toward ostentation. The flaw of ostentation disrupted the purity—hence, *"and thus it lacks virtue."*

**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**
*Lower virtue does not lose virtue*—*lower virtue* refers to the sovereigns of the *Hao* (Emperor Yao) era, whose *virtue* did not reach the heights of the upper—hence, *"lower virtue."* *"Does not lose virtue"* means their *virtue* was visible, their achievements named. *"And thus it lacks virtue"* is because their titles and personhood were now defined.

**Commentary by Li Rong:**
The winds of *Dao* and *virtue* were nearly lost, and the transformations of *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) were about to arise.

When words and deeds became manifest, the age grew corrupt—hence, *"lower virtue."*

To take *virtue* as *virtue*, to take achievement as achievement, to rely on *virtue* while boasting of deeds—hence, *"does not lose virtue."*

To grasp *virtue* in words yet fail to embody non-action—hence, *"and thus it lacks virtue."*

Those who inwardly illuminate the body’s unity with emptiness and stillness—this is *virtue*’s summit.
Those whose affairs are entangled in multiplicity—this is *virtue*’s base.

When fixation clings to the heart, hence *"does not lose virtue."*
But fixation leads to loss—hence, *"and thus it lacks virtue."*

**Commentary by Master Cheng:**
Not yet reaching the ultimate, hence called *"lower."*
To cling to *virtue* without forgetting—hence *"does not lose."*
Not yet able to merge in obscurity—hence *"lacks virtue."*

**On *Upper Virtue*:**
*Upper virtue* acts without action, yet does nothing—
**Imperial Gloss:** To know non-action and thus act is not the utmost.
To act without action through non-action—this is the utmost.
Thus, *upper virtue*’s non-action is not to conform to the beauty of non-action,
but to contain and nurture purity, naturally aligning with non-action—
hence *"yet does nothing,"*
for here, both mind and trace are without action.

**Imperial Citation:** This elucidates *upper virtue.*
*Upper virtue* operates in hidden non-action, its purity undispersed—
thus, no name or trace remains.
Now, *upper virtue*’s non-action is but to contain and nurture purity,
naturally aligning with non-action,
not knowing the beauty of non-action to *do* non-action—
hence *"yet does nothing,"*
for it is not merely without ostentation to boast,
but also without intent yet transforming naturally—
thus the Gloss says: *"Here, both mind and trace are without action."*

**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**
*Upper virtue* acts without action—speaking of *Dao*’s law as tranquil, doing nothing.
Yet *"does nothing"*—speaking of not relying on titles or names.

**Commentary by Li Rong:**
*"With"* means *"to use."*
The Sage uses non-action to transform the people below,
the people use non-action to serve the Sage above.

**Commentary by Master Cheng:**
*"With"* means *"to use."*
*Upper virtue*’s non-action is rooted in the ultimate stillness,
yet *"does nothing"*—its trace is used in subtle mystery.
This clarifies *"non-action yet action,"*
for action is itself non-action.

**On *Lower Virtue*:**
*Lower virtue* acts, yet has something to rely on—
**Imperial Gloss:** *Lower virtue* acts—meaning though the mind is without action,
its deeds are manifest and its traces lean toward action—
hence *"acts."*
Speaking of *lower virtue*’s non-action:
it has a means to act, yet this acting is the mind’s non-action.

**Imperial Citation:** This elucidates *lower virtue.*
*Lower virtue* acts—meaning it follows the Sage’s beautiful non-action,
yet *does* this non-action—
hence *"acts."*
Though the mind desires non-action,
in practice, it leans toward ostentation—
hence *"yet has something to rely on."*
Speaking of *lower virtue*’s acting:
it has a means to act.
Thus the Gloss says: *"The mind is without action, the trace is with action."*

**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**
*Lower virtue* acts—meaning it issues teachings and administers governance.
Yet *"has something to rely on"*—meaning it claims titles and names for itself.

**Commentary by Li Rong:**
The Sage uses action to guide the people below,
the people also use action to serve the Sage above—
how so?
Grass bends with the wind, drifting westward;
shadows follow form, curving and straightening.
Thus, the ruler of all under heaven must not engage in excess,
for governance returns to emptiness and stillness.
Teaching disciples must not violate propriety,
for loyalty and filial piety are its essence.

**Commentary by Master Cheng:**
The mind does not forget *virtue*—hence called *"acts."*
Yet progress still involves affairs—hence *"has something to rely on."*

**On *Upper Benevolence*:**
*Upper benevolence* acts, yet has nothing to rely on—
**Imperial Gloss:** *Benevolence* is the name for universal love.
As *lower virtue* declines, *upper benevolence* emerges—
thus, universal love is *benevolence*, hence *"acts."*
To practice *benevolence* while forgetting *benevolence*,
also desiring non-action—
hence *"yet has nothing to rely on,"*
for here, the mind acts yet the trace is without action.
Moreover, *upper benevolence* is called non-action
because, though it seeks non-action, it aligns with higher righteousness—
it cannot yet compare to *lower virtue*’s action.

**Imperial Citation:** This further clarifies that when *Dao* declines, *benevolence* and *righteousness* arise.
*Upper benevolence*—meaning *benevolence* as supreme, the rest following suit.
*Benevolence* is the name for universal love—
when *Dao* is in full practice, all things receive private blessings,
but as pure winds disperse, universal love takes root.
Now, it clarifies why *benevolence* is universal love—
hence *"upper benevolence acts."*
To practice *benevolence* while forgetting *benevolence*:
though it says *"do not seek repayment,"*
universal love is difficult to universalize,
and partial kindness cannot fully win trust—
thus, the mind is always engaged in affairs—
hence *"acts."*
In practice, it approaches non-action—
hence *"yet has nothing to rely on."*
Thus the Gloss says: *"Here, the mind acts yet the trace is without action."*

**Commentary by Lord He Shang:**
*Upper benevolence* acts—meaning the sovereign who practices *benevolence*,
whose *benevolence* is supreme—hence *"upper."*
*"Acts"* refers to benevolent grace.
*"Yet has nothing to rely on"*—meaning deeds accomplished, no claim to hold.

**Commentary by Li Rong:**
*Upper benevolence* acts yet has nothing to rely on,
*upper righteousness* acts yet has something to rely on.
Universal love and broad bestowal—this is *benevolence*.
Rewarding the good and punishing the wicked—this is *righteousness*.
Consistently upholding *virtue* and *power*—this is fitting for the Sage.
*Upper virtue* and *lower virtue* reflect the differing transformations of corruption and purity.
Non-action and action clarify the distinction between gain and loss in governance.
The designation of *lower virtue* as *"acts"* is the inferiority of *upper virtue*.
The designation of *upper benevolence* as *"has nothing to rely on"* is the superiority of *upper righteousness*.

**Commentary by Master Cheng:**
*Benevolence* is compassion—
with a mind to nurture, hence *"acts."*
Not demanding repayment, hence *"has nothing to rely on."*
Strictly speaking, *upper benevolence* does not reach *lower virtue*,
yet compared to *righteousness*, *benevolence* prevails—
hence *"has nothing to rely on."*
Among the Three Treasures, compassion is first,
thus within the Five *Virtues*, *benevolence* is paramount.

**On *Upper Righteousness*:**
*Upper righteousness* acts, yet has something to rely on—
**Imperial Gloss:** *Righteousness* means to judge wrongs—
meaning it judges wrongs, hence *"acts."*

「When there are matters requiring the judgment of wrongs, the ruler must cut them off and order them to suit their proper measure—
thus it is said *"while having something to rely on,"*
for both the mind and its traces are engaged in action.

**Commentary by Master Cheng:**
*Righteousness* is the proper measure—
meaning to regulate, judge, and cut off wrongs,
so that all things attain their fitting place.
When simplicity and purity are lost,
distinctions of right and wrong arise.
To judge wrongs and restore proper measure,
the ruler must act accordingly—
thus it is said *"Upper Righteousness acts,"*
meaning the mind has the intent to judge wrongs,
and there are reasons and means for its actions,
hence *"while having something to rely on."*
Therefore, the Imperial Gloss states:
*"Here, both the mind and its traces are engaged in action."*

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
*"Upper Righteousness acts"*—
meaning the ruler enforces righteousness through judgment and execution.
*"While having something to rely on"*—
meaning he takes action for his own benefit,
kills to establish his authority,
and imposes taxes on the people to sustain himself.

**Commentary by Master Cheng:**
*Righteousness* is primarily about restraining evil and judging wrongs—
this is the essence of the precepts and disciplines in the *sutras*.
Yet the origin of these precepts is to accommodate the lower capacities of beings,
and their implementation involves actions—
they have not yet ascended to the realm of emptiness and mystery,
hence *"while having something to rely on."*

**On *Upper Rites/Courtesy*:**
When *rites* are performed yet none respond,
the ruler rolls up his sleeves and enforces them.
**Imperial Gloss:**
If the Six *Courtesies* (六紀) are not in harmony,
then *rites* are instituted to remedy the decline—
thus it is said *"he performs them."*
*Rites* emphasize reciprocity—
if none come in response, it is not proper *rites*.
When *rites* are extended to others,
yet they do not reciprocate,
the ruler rolls up his sleeves in anger—
thus it is said *"he rolls up his sleeves and enforces them."*

**Commentary by Master He Shang Gong:**
*"Upper Rites acts"*—
meaning the ruler, who upholds the highest *rites*,
has no superior in his establishment of rites and ceremonies.
*"None respond"*—
meaning *rites*, though outwardly grand, are inwardly hollow,
decorative and burdensome,
so that even a slight movement provokes mockery—
they cannot be properly followed.
*"He rolls up his sleeves and enforces them"*—
meaning because the rites are too burdensome to follow,
the people and rulers alike grow angry and quarrel,
thus rolling up their sleeves to provoke one another.

**Honor says:**
The *rites* consist of the Three Hundred *Classics* and Three Thousand *Ceremonies*—
with these, the ruler instructs the people,
hence *"he performs them."*
When *rites* become excessive, disorder follows—
the lower classes cannot uphold them,
hence *"none respond."*
This can be said to reflect the truth:
*"Trust is insufficient, leading to distrust."*
Trust, when genuine, requires no words—
but distrust breeds anger and contention,
thus the ruler rolls up his sleeves and rolls up his arms,
dragging one another into conflict.

**Commentary by Master Cheng:**
When *rites* are performed yet none respond,
it is because *rites* emphasize ceremonies and etiquette—
this is the practice of ceremonial fasting and observances in the *sutras*.
Moreover, the *Dao* is pure and tranquil,
its great symbol formless—
yet now, simplicity is discarded in favor of ornamentation,
substance is abandoned for superficiality,
and the pursuit of ceremonial grandeur overshadows the essence of forgetting and detachment.
Though these may serve as gradual teachings,
they fail to align with true principle—
not only do they contradict the *Dao* internally,
but externally, they cannot be properly followed by others.
Thus it is said *"he performs them yet none respond."*
*"He rolls up his sleeves and enforces them"*—
*仍* (rén) means *"to follow or adhere."*
*Rites* emphasize reciprocity and mutual expectations—
because the rites are shallow,
the ruler rolls up his sleeves in anger,
desiring to illustrate the flaws of *rites* as a teaching.
Hence, the *Zhuangzi* states:
*"Ru wine is thin, yet Deng You surrounds himself with walls"*—
this is the very situation.

**Thirdly, it clarifies the decline from the root—**
urging the return to the source and abandonment of superficiality.
Thus, when the *Dao* is lost, *virtue* emerges;
when *virtue* is lost, *benevolence* remains;
when *benevolence* is lost, *righteousness* stands;
when *righteousness* is lost, *rites* are instituted.

**Imperial Gloss:**
*"Losing the Dao"*—
meaning losing *upper virtue*,
for *upper virtue* aligns with the *Dao*,
hence *"losing the Dao."*
*Virtue*, *power*, *benevolence*, and *righteousness* are terms
adapted to the varying simplicity or complexity of the times—
thus it is said:
*"When the Dao declines, virtue appears;
when virtue is lost, benevolence remains;
when benevolence fades, righteousness is established;
when righteousness perishes, rites are instituted—*
these are all measures suited to their respective times."*

Therefore, when discussing *rites* in the age of simplicity and purity,
they are either reckless or contrary—
and when *rites* are forgotten in the age of corruption and excess,
it is either foolishness or deceit.
If one can reform and return to the root,
then they should retreat from *rites* and practice *righteousness*,
retreat from *righteousness* and practice *benevolence*,
retreat from *benevolence* and practice *virtue*,
forget *virtue* and return to the *Dao*,
so that people revert to simplicity and purity—
then *upper virtue* attains *"nothing to rely on."*

**Commentary by Master He Shang Gong:**
*"Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue emerges"*—
meaning the *Dao* declines, and moral cultivation arises.
*"When virtue is lost, benevolence remains"*—
meaning virtue declines, and compassionate love becomes apparent.
*"When benevolence fades, righteousness is established"*—
meaning compassion wanes, and distinctions of right and wrong are clarified.

「失义而后礼，义衰则礼施，
when *righteousness* declines, *rites* are then applied—
when *righteousness* wanes, *rites* are put into practice,
and the use of jade and silk becomes the standard.

○荣曰：
*"Honor"* says:
When the *Dao* was profound and ancient, pure and harmonious,
the emotions of things were sincere and true,
and people found self-sufficiency within,
needing no *virtue* or *righteousness* to nurture and moisten them.
Families lived without contrivance,
each embracing *virtue* and *power* to float and swim freely.

The *trigrams* and their symbols were not yet formed,
nor had the teachings of the *Dao* yet emerged.
The bonds of kinship and distance were indistinct,
and distinctions of nobility and humility were forgotten—
this was the age of *Upper Virtue*’s unknown,
the transformation of the *Great Dao*.

When this pure wind had dispersed,
the *coinage* of titles arose,
and the *righteousness* of raising and feeding people took form,
the achievement of *saving and assisting* became manifest.
The *Dao*-attained Sage acted in concealment,
while the common folk found peace in self-sufficiency—
this was the transformation of *Upper Virtue*.

When *benevolence* toward kin was born,
the *function* of universal love began to take root,
but *benevolence* toward kin was not yet comprehensive,
and love had its own distinctions—
thus, the *wind of benevolence* grew gradually.

When *benevolence* toward kin was insufficient to transform the customs,
then rewards and punishments were introduced to govern the people,
and the *righteousness* of rewards and punishments was lost,
abandoning the *rites* of *virtue*’s transformation.
The people were taught to yield and comply,
and to act through jade and silk—
yet the ruler deceived from above,
and the ministers lied from below.
The pure source had already receded,
and the *wind of excess* blazed fiercely.

○成疏：
*"The Commentary of Cheng"* says:
Thus, when the *Dao* is lost, *virtue* emerges—
the *Dao*, the *upper virtue* of the Sage.
As the *Dao*’s transformation declines,
the *Dao*’s influence fades,
and the *virtue* of the lower sages appears.
When *virtue* is lost, *benevolence* remains—
the *Dao*’s transformation wanes,
and *benevolence* and compassion follow.
When *benevolence* fades, *righteousness* is established—
the compassionate heart is no longer in practice,
and thus the *righteousness* of distinctions arises.
When *righteousness* declines, *rites* are then applied—
the *Dao*’s purity and simplicity are utterly abandoned,
and this is the extreme—
when unable to stop evil, then formalized *rites* are employed.
Though these *rites* may seem forcibly imposed,
the superficiality and artifice have grown even more severe.

The fourth stage condemns *rites* as the origin of superficiality,
demonstrating the direction of their selection and rejection.
*Rites* are the thinning of *loyalty* and *truthfulness*,
and the beginning of chaos.

○御注：
*"The Imperial Commentary"* notes:
*"Rites"* (夫礼者) is the opening phrase,
stating that *rites* are the fading of *loyalty* and *truthfulness*—
meaning that when the *Dao* is abandoned,
and superficial governance prevails,
*loyalty* and *truthfulness* grow thin and weak.
Yet *rites* are the beginning of chaos,
for when *rites* are used to prevent chaos,
they can only serve as a means to manage disorder,
not as the true essence of *virtue* and *power*.

○御疏：
*"The Imperial Exegesis"* says:
The establishment of *rites* comes from the decline of *loyalty* and *truthfulness*,
using *rites* as the first means to prevent chaos.
The purpose of *rites* is to pacify the ruler and govern the people—
how could it be merely jade and silk?
Yet when those who practice *rites* do not focus on the inner nature of humanity,
but only on outward forms,
when reverence and love are insufficient,
and ceremonial offerings are excessive—
this is not the vision of the enlightened,
but truly the beginning of folly.

○河上公曰：
*"Master He Shang Gong"* says:
*"Rites"* are the thinning of *loyalty* and *truthfulness*,
meaning that when the *Dao* is neglected,
and outward forms are emphasized,
*loyalty* and *truthfulness* grow thin and weak.
And *rites* are the beginning of chaos,
for they value superficial appearances over substance,
thus the upright grow fewer,
while deceit and disorder multiply.

○荣曰：
*"Honor"* says:
When people are all earnest and sincere,
each holding *loyalty* and *truthfulness* in their hearts,
there is no need for elaborate *rites*.
But when *loyalty* and *truthfulness* have already thinned,
and the *wind of excess* has thickened,
confusion and disorder have spread even more—
using *rites* to govern them,
valuing outward forms over substance,
only increases deceit and disorder—
thus, they are said to be the beginning of chaos.

○成疏：
*"The Commentary of Cheng"* says:
Those who merely display outward forms of ceremony
have not yet attained sincerity from the heart.
Since they are not thick with genuine *loyalty* and *truthfulness*,
they only serve to thin the essence of sincerity.
They do not curb the roots of superficiality and deceit,
but instead provide the means for greater confusion and disorder.
Thus, the wise person who perceives this beforehand
knows that *rites* are the *flower* of the *Dao*,
and the beginning of folly.

○御注：
*"The Imperial Commentary"* notes:
*"Perceiving beforehand"* (前识者) refers to human nature and understanding,
meaning that those who establish these outward *rites*
before cultivating the inner nature of humanity
may seem to conform to the times,
but in reality, they abandon simplicity and purity—
thus, they are the *flower* of the *Dao*.

When *rites* are used to prevent chaos,
the most valuable thing is harmony and unity,
but those who practice *rites* without understanding their true intent
will only emphasize the jade and silk,
and value bowing and kneeling—
such people are the beginning of folly.

○御疏：
*"The Imperial Exegesis"* says:
*"Perceiving beforehand"* refers to those who establish *rites*.
It means that those who establish *rites* beforehand
do so before cultivating the inner nature of humanity.
The *Dao* follows human nature,
while *rites* preserve outward appearances—
this is why such a *Dao* is contrary to natural simplicity,
and thus is called the *flower* of the *Dao*.
Yet it is the beginning of folly,
for though *rites* are meant to pacify chaos,
they arise from chaos itself—
the ideal is to restore harmony,
but those who practice *rites* in this age
do not focus on the inner nature of humanity,
but only on outward forms.
When reverence and love are insufficient,
and ceremonial offerings are excessive—
this is not the vision of the enlightened,
but truly the beginning of folly.

○河上公曰：
*"Master He Shang Gong"* says:
*"Perceiving beforehand"* are the *flower* of the *Dao*,
for they claim to know without truly understanding—
this is what is meant by "perceiving beforehand."
Such people have lost the true *Dao*,
yet they possess its superficial *flower*—
and they are the beginning of folly,
for those who perceive beforehand
are the first to sing the praises of folly and darkness.

○荣曰：
*"Honor"* says:
*Virtue* and *power* are the true *Dao*,
while *benevolence* and *righteousness* are its *flower*.
Those who first recognize *benevolence* and *righteousness*
know only the *flower*, not the true essence.
The enlightened naturally align with *Dao*’s principles,
while the ignorant rely on teachings and guidance.
Recognizing *rites* is not the foundation of superior wisdom,
but the beginning of folly.

○成疏：
*"The Commentary of Cheng"* says:
To claim knowledge while knowing nothing
is called "perceiving beforehand."
It states that such people,
when cultivating the *Dao* and practicing its ways,
are deeply immersed in superficiality and artifice.
They are not the source of great wisdom,
but the beginning of ignorance and folly.

Thus, the *Great Man* abides in the *thick* and not the *thin*,
dwells in the *real* and not the *flower*.
○御注：
*"The Imperial Commentary"* notes:
The *thick* refers to those who engage in *action*—
the *Dao*’s *thick* aspect.
*Rites* and *righteousness* are the *flower* of *virtue*.
Hence, the Sage abides in the *Dao*’s inaction,
dwelling in the *thick*—
not in the *thin*.
He withdraws from the practice of *rites* and *righteousness*,
not dwelling in the *flower*—
but abiding in the *real*.

○御疏：
*"The Imperial Exegesis"* says:
The *Great Man* refers to the *Dao*-attained gentleman,
the same as the earlier *upper virtue* ruler.
*Virtue* and *power* are without *action*,
called the *thick* and *real*—
while *rites* and *righteousness* involve *action*,
called the *thin* and *flower*.
It says that the Sage first practices the transformation of *virtue* and *power*,
thus dwelling in the *thick* and *real*—
and later, the teachings of *rites* and *righteousness*,
thus not dwelling in the *thin* and *flower*.

○河上公曰：
*"Master He Shang Gong"* says:
Thus, the *Great Man* abides in the *thick*—
the *Great Man* refers to the *Dao*-attained ruler,
abiding in the *thick* means his body is sincere and pure.

「Not abiding in its thinness—
he does not act contrary to the Dao/Way in his body,
nor does he trouble the world with strife.

Abiding in its real—
he abides in *loyalty* and *trustworthiness*.

Not dwelling in its flower—
he does not indulge in empty, superficial words.

○ *Master Rong* says:
Thus, the *Great Man* abides in the *thick*—
not in its thinness,
dwells in its real—
not in its flower,
hence the saying: *forsake that and take this*.

*Dispersing* the *unadorned* to make *vessels*—
this is tracing its origin to the most *pure* and *unadorned*.
*Losing* the Dao/Way, then *virtue/power*—
this is its ultimate fate: *dissipated* and *thin*.

Thus, *benevolence* is not innate,
*righteousness* is not natural,
*trustworthiness* does not arise from sincerity,
*rites* are mere external adornment.
Discernment of *right* and *wrong*, warfare, deceit, and intricate cleverness abound—
fathers and sons lose the heart of *filial piety*,
rulers and ministers stray from the *loyalty* and *righteousness* of the Dao/Way.
Hence, the *Great Sage* *Laozi* lamented the great errors of the age,
pitied the decline of the *Dao/Way*,
desiring to suppress the superficial and exalt the fundamental,
to quiet the dissipated and return to the *pure*.

Thus, when the *Great Man* governs the nation and manages the household,
cultivates his person and establishes conduct,
he must take this *thick* and *real* of Dao/Way and *virtue/power*,
forsake that *flower* of *benevolence* and *righteousness*—
then he abandons the *customary rites*,
and returns to the *true Dao/Way*.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Exegesis says:
Thus, the *Great Man* abides in the *thick*—
not in its thinness.
*Zhang* (丈), meaning *long*—
*Fu* (夫), meaning *support*.
It is one who possesses the courage, compassion, and wisdom to *save* and *uphold*,
capable of being the *leader* among all *creatures*,
to support and protect the *masses*.

His aspirations are vast and universal,
hence he is called the *Great Man*.
The *Great Man* should cherish the *thick* and *real* of Dao/Way and *virtue/power*,
how could he dwell in the *thin* and *flower* of *rites* and *righteousness*?
Abiding in its real—
not in its flower—
the *Dao*-attained person, the *unworldly* recluse,
should retain his *emotions* in the *pure* and *unadorned* real,
how could he fix his *mind* on the *superficial* and *flowery*?
Hence, *forsake that and take this*.

*Imperial Annotation*: Forsake that *flower* and thinness, take this *pure* and *thick*.
○ *Imperial Exegesis*: *That* refers to *rites* and *righteousness*,
*this* refers to Dao/Way and *virtue/power*.
The Sage abandons the *floating* and *flowery* of *rites* and *righteousness*,
takes the *thick* and *real* of Dao/Way and *virtue/power*,
hence the saying: *forsake that and take this*.
Yet, *firmly* discussing the Sage’s hundred deliberations converging into one,
both *boundaries* are extinguished—
how could there be *that* and *this* to forsake or take?
The teachings are set forth to guide the *common* and *ordinary*—
thus it is said.

○ *Master He Shang Gong* says:
Forsake that *flower* and thinness, take this *thick* and *real*.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Exegesis says:
Forsake that *flower* and thinness—
this is to utterly reject *benevolence* and abandon *righteousness*.
Take this *real* and *thick*—
this is to return to the *unadorned* and restore the *pure*.
Moreover, the *upper virtue* Sage has no *distinctions*,
how could he have a *mind* on *that* and *this*,
or *emotions* bound to *forsaking* and *taking*?
It is only made clear that though he *forsakes*, he does not truly forsake,
though he *takes*, he does not truly take—
not the *forsaking* of *forsaking*,
nor the *taking* of *taking*.
Since *forsaking* and *taking* are thus,
*that* and *this* are also thus.

*Formerly, those who attained the One*—
Chapter Thirty-Nine
*Formerly* refers to the second major section,
while the first chapter expounds broadly on *virtue/power* and *righteousness*,
and within this chapter, *righteousness* is divided into three parts:
First, it demonstrates the efficacy of attaining the One,
Second, it reveals the harm of losing the One,
Third, it clarifies the Dao/Way’s *humility* and *modesty*,
concluding the meaning of attaining the One.

First, it demonstrates the efficacy of attaining the One.

From the *initial division* of the *One qi*,
the *Great Sky* and *Earth* established the *Two Principles*,
the *Three Realms* began their positions,
and *kings* and *lords* were honored as the *exalted* of the *ten thousand nations*.
Having both *clear* and *clouded* sources,
they also grasp the *potter’s wheel*—
the *beginning* is unseen,
*Emperor Han Wen* thus lost his way,
the *end* is unperceived,
*Master He Shang Gong* then revealed the *cover*.
*Mysterious* and *obscure*, yet *generous* and *lending*,
all *things* are enriched and *resources* abound—
*grains* attain *fullness*,
*kings* attain *nobility*,
thus it is known that the *unification* of *mysterious* and *pure* is the *wondrous* origin,
*mingling* the *Three Realms* and defying thought,
*obscure* yet the *true* *principle*,
penetrating the *Nine Heavens* and unfathomable,
the *logic* of *spontaneous* *wonder*—
its essence lies here.

*Formerly, those who attained the One*—
*Imperial Annotation*: The *One* is the *harmony* of the Dao/Way,
also called the *unifying qi*.
It is called the *One* because its *wondrous* *function* lies in *things* as a unified whole,
ancient and modern, without distinction—
this is called the *One*.
Hence, the *Book of Changes·Appendices* says:
*The interplay of one yin and one yang is called the Dao/Way*—
it is made clear that the Dao/Way’s *qi* in *yin* unifies with *yin*,
and in *yang* unifies with *yang*.
It says *formerly those who attained*—
they sought to trace the *origin* and grasp the *end*,
to suppress the superficial and return to the fundamental.
Thus, they cite *formerly attained* to confirm *now attained*,
the *number* of those attaining the One is as follows:

○ *Master He Shang Gong* says:
*Formerly* (昔), meaning *past*—
*One* (一), meaning *non-action*—
the *child* of the Dao/Way.

○ *Master Yan* says:
The *One* is the *child* of the Dao/Way,
in *spirit* it is *non-existent*,
in the Dao/Way it is *existent*—
the *primordial* of *primordials*,
the *beginning* of *beginnings*,
*verdant* and *solitary*,
*profound* and *wondrous*—
the *key* to *transformation*.

○ *Master Rong* says:
*Formerly, those who attained the One*—
the *Sky* attains the *One* and becomes *clear*,
the *Earth* attains the *One* and becomes *tranquil*,
the *spirit* attains the *One* and becomes *responsive*,
*grains* attain the *One* and become *full*,
the *ten thousand things* attain the *One* and come to *life*,
*lords* and *kings* attain the *One* to become the *correct* of the *world*.
The *One* is *primordial qi*,
undivided and without duality—
hence it is called the *One*.
Though *Sky* and *Earth* are vast,
what they receive is the *primordial One*,
though the *ten thousand things* are abundant,
what they rely on is the *unifying qi*.
Though *lords* and *kings* are noble,
what they depend on is the *true Dao/Way*.
Thus, the *clear* and *pure* are vast in *covering*,
the *tranquil* and *still* are thick in *bearing*,
*transformation* and *change* are *precise* and *responsive*,
*emptiness* and *openness* are *full* and *satisfied*,
*peace* and *contentment* are complete in *life*,
*non-action* yet *correct* and *fixed*—
how is this achieved?
All attain the *One* from the Dao/Way.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Exegesis says:
*Formerly* (昔), meaning *ancient*—
*One* (一), meaning the Dao/Way.
It speaks of the *beginning* of past *kalpas*,
the *state* of those who attained the Dao/Way,
all of which are listed in the following text—
this is to *verify* the present and *cite* the ancient.
The *Sky* attains the *One* and becomes *clear*—
*Imperial Annotation*: Among the *phenomena* of *qi*,
none surpass the *Great Sky*—
its *covering* is *vast* and *broad*.
○ *Imperial Exegesis*: The *phenomenon* of *qi* most grand,
none grander than the *Great Sky*—
hence it first marks the *One* attained by the *Sky*.」

The *pure yang* *qi* arises from attaining the *One*—
thus it can *cover* and *broadly* *ascend* the *Sky*,
and *nourish* the *beginning* of all things.

○ *Master He Shang* says:
The *Sky* attains the *One*—
thus it can *hang* the *phenomena* in *clear* radiance.
The *Earth* attains the *One*—
thus it can be *stable* and *unmoving*, never *shaken*.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Exegesis:
*Receiving* the *Dao/Way*’s *radiance*,
*accumulating* *yang* to form the *Sky*,
*clear* and *floating* above.
The *Earth* attains the *One* and becomes *tranquil*—

○ *Imperial Annotation*:
Among the *forms* and *substances*,
none surpass the *Great Earth*—
*pure yin*’s *substance*,
from attaining the *One* it can be *massive* and *solid*,
*broadly* *bearing* all things,
and *nourish* the *beginning* of life.

○ *Imperial Exegesis*:
Among the *forms* and *substances*,
none greater than the *Great Earth*—
*pure yin*’s *substance*,
from attaining the *One* it can be *massive* and *solid*,
*broadly* *bearing* all things,
and *nourish* the *beginning* of life.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Exegesis:
*All* *receiving* the *One Dao/Way*,
thus *congealing* *yin* to form the *Earth*,
*tranquil* and *stable* below.

The *Spirit* attains the *One* and becomes *wondrous*—

○ *Imperial Exegesis*:
The *Spirit*—
this refers to the *marvelous* *transformations* of all things.
From attaining the *One*, it can *pervade* *changes* without *bound*,
and cannot be *traced* or *constrained* by form.

○ *Master He Shang* says:
The *Spirit* attains the *One*—
thus it can *change* and *transform* without form.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Exegesis:
The *Dao/Way* of the *Spirit* dwells in *yin*,
in *dark* and *dim* realms beyond measure.
From its attaining the *One*,
it knows *wondrous* things without limit—
as the *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The Spirit of ghosts and gods, the Spirit of the Sovereign and the Dao/Way,
give birth to the *Sky* and the *Earth*."*

The *Valleys* attain the *One* and become *full*—

○ *Imperial Annotation*:
The *Valleys* attain the *One* and become *full*—
all things attain the *One* and thus *come to life*.
Things refer to *all* that is *moving* or *still*,
*sentient* or *insentient*—
their *movement* and *growth* never *exhaust*.

○ *Imperial Exegesis*:
Water flowing into rivers becomes the *Han*,
flowing into streams becomes the *Valleys*—
from attaining the *One*, it can *well* and *spring*,
*flowing* and *moistening*, *full* yet never *exhausted*.

○ *Master He Shang* says:
The *Valleys* attain the *One*—
thus they can be *full* and *never* *cut off*.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Exegesis:
The *Valleys*—
these are the *vales* of rivers.
It states that the *Valleys*, from attaining the *One*,
can *well* and *spring*, *flowing* and *moistening*,
while *streams* and *ravines* become *full*.

All things attain the *One* and thus *come to life*—

○ *Imperial Exegesis*:
Things refer to *all* that is *moving* or *still*,
*sentient* or *insentient*—
collectively called *things*.
From attaining the *One*’s *unrestrained* *qi*,
they can *come to life* and *move* without *ceasing* or *perishing*.

○ *Master He Shang* says:
All things *must* rely on the *Dao/Way* to *come to life*.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Exegesis:
*Sentient* yet *insentient*—
all are called *things*.
*All* *receiving* the *One Dao/Way*,
thus they attain *life* and *formation*.

The *Lords and Kings* attain the *One*—
and thus *establish* *correctness* for all under *Heaven*.

○ *Imperial Annotation*:
The *Lords and Kings* attain the *One* to *establish* *correctness* for all under *Heaven*—
this is how they *achieve* it:
things attain the *Dao/Way* and *use* it,
and *names* are *established* by *use*.
When the *Dao/Way* *exists*, *names* are *established*;
when *use* is *lost*, *reality* is *forfeited*.
Thus, the *Sky* is *clear*, the *Earth* is *tranquil*,
the *Spirit* is *wondrous*, the *Valleys* are *full*,
and all things *come to life*—
all rely on the *marvelous* *use* of the *Dao/Way*
to *govern* thus.
Hence it says, *"this is how they achieve it."*

○ *Imperial Exegesis*:
The *Lords and Kings*—
these are the *rulers* of men.
The *Lords* hold the *five ranks* of *nobility*,
the *Kings* command the *ten thousand chariots*.
It states that the *Lords and Kings*, from attaining the *One*,
can *permanently* possess the *Heavenly Mandate*,
so that *none* *resist* them,
and they *establish* *correctness* and *equity* under *Heaven*.

*"Correct"* can also be read as *"veritable"*—
*veritable* is the same as *correct*.

○ *Master He Shang* says:
The *Lords and Kings* attain the *One*—
thus they can *establish* *equity* and *correctness* under *Heaven*.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Exegesis:
The *Emperor*, *King*, *Duke*, *Marquis*, and *Earl*—
none fail to *receive* the *transformations*.
Only by *non-action* do they attain the *One*,
and thus *spread* *correctness* under *Heaven*.
*Yu the Great* and *Shun* are examples of this.

*"This is how they achieve it."*

○ *Imperial Exegesis*:
This *summarizes* the *meaning* of the prior *six* and *leads* to what follows.
*"Achieve"* means *"attain"*—
it asks: how does the *Sky* attain *clarity*,
the *Earth* attain *tranquility*,
the *Spirit* attain *wondrousness*,
the *Valleys* attain *fullness*,
all things attain *life* and *formation*,
and the *Lords and Kings* attain *correctness* and *equity*?
It is all from the *marvelous* *use* of the *Dao/Way*.
This *illustrates* that attaining the *Dao/Way* brings *benefit*.

The following text *warns* of the *harm* of losing the *One*.

○ *Master He Shang* says:
*"Govern"* means *"test"*—
this refers to the *six* matters below.

○ *Rong* says:
The *Dao/Way* has no *rise* or *fall*,
but *things* have *attainment* or *loss*.
Those who *attain* it *benefit*—
as in the prior text.
Those who *lose* it *suffer*—
as in what follows.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Exegesis:
*"Govern"* means *"attain"*—
it *connects* the prior *six*,
all of which *attain* the *One Dao/Way*.
If taken as an *internal* interpretation—
then it refers to *six* kinds of *conduct* within a single person.

The second section *reveals* the *disadvantages* of losing the *One*,
showing that it *must* bring *harm*.

The *Sky* without *clarity* would fear *rupture*—

○ *Imperial Annotation*:
This is the *language* of *warning* and *admonition*.

○ *Imperial Exegesis*:
*"Without"* is the *language* of *sincerity*.
*"Use"* means *employ*.
Those who *cling* to *preservation* will *lose* it,
and those who *fixate* on *attainment* will *forfeit* it.
It states that the *Sky*, from attaining the *Dao/Way*’s *unrestrained* *qi*,
becomes *clear* and *floating*.
If it does not *guard* the *Dao/Way*’s *harmony* and *gentleness*,
but *fixates* on *using* its *clarity*,
then it would fear *breaking* and *scattering*,
and the *phenomena* would not *form*.

○ *Master He Shang* says:
The *Sky* must have *yin* and *yang* *alternating*,
*day* and *night* *replacing* each other in *function*—
it cannot be that one *only* desires *clear* radiance without end,
or it would fear *splitting* and *not* becoming the *Sky*.

○ *Rong* says:
The *Sky* without *clarity* would fear *rupture*,
the *Earth* without *tranquility* would fear *disturbance*,
the *Spirit* without *wondrousness* would fear *cessation*,
the *Valleys* without *fullness* would fear *exhaustion*,
all things without *life* would fear *perishing*,
and the *Lords and Kings* without *high* and *noble* *virtue* would fear *overthrow*.
The *true One Dao/Way* must not be *lost*.

*"Losing"* it leads to *phenomena* forming—
but fear *rupture* when they *break*.
*"Forming"* leads to fear *disturbance* and *movement*,
and when *unmeasurable* things are feared,
they would fear *cessation* and *extinction*.
The *void* and *intervals* would fear *drying up* and *exhaustion*,
*life* and *wondrousness* would fear *death* and *perishing*,
and *high* and *noble* *virtue* would fear *overthrow*.

○ *Master Cheng*’s Exegesis:
*"Use"* means *employ*.
*"Without"* means *not*.
*"Rupture"* means *destruction*.
It states that if the *Sky* does not *employ* the *Dao/Way*’s *clear* and *void* nature,
then the *sun* and *moon* will *flourish* and *eclipse*,
the *stars* will *lose* their *degrees*,
and *disasters* and *changes* will *frequently* *manifest*—
fearing that it would *reach* *destruction*.

The *Earth* without *tranquility* would fear *disturbance*—

○ *Imperial Annotation*:
*Admonishing* it to *not cling* to its *use*.

○ *Imperial Exegesis*:
It states that the *Earth*, from attaining the *Dao/Way*’s *use*,
*governs* with *tranquility*.
It must *forget* its *tranquility*—
if one *fixates* on *using* its *tranquility*,
it would fear *reaching* *disturbance* and *overflow*,
and the *form* would not *establish*.

○ *Master He Shang* says:
The *Earth* must have *high* and *low*,
*firm* and *yielding*,
*seasonal* *qi* and *Five Phases*—
it cannot be that one *only* desires *stability* without end,
or it would fear *disturbance* and *overflow*,
and *not* become the *Earth*.

○ **Master Cheng’s Exegesis**:
*Fā* means *dynamic transformation*.
It says that the *Earth*, if it cannot *apply* the *Dao/Way*’s *tranquility*,
would fear *catastrophes* of *collapse* and *ruin*.
In ancient times, the *Qí Shān* collapsed, causing the *Three Rivers* to tremble—this is an example.

The *Spirit* without *manifestation* would fear *cessation*,
○ **Imperial Annotation**:
*Admonishing* the *Spirit* to *not cling* to its *use*,
lest it *fail* to *wondrously* *apply* itself.

○ **Imperial Exegesis**:
It states that the *Spirit*, having attained the *Dao/Way*’s *use*,
can *manifest* *wondrously* without measure.
It must *forget* its *precision* and *verve*—
if one *fixates* on *using* its *manifestation*,
it would fear *reaching* *exhaustion* and *cessation*,
and *not* *wondrously* *apply* itself.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** says:
The *Spirit* must have *sovereignty* and *ministerial* *roles*,
*prisonment*, *death*, *rest*, and *abandonment*—
it cannot be that one *only* desires *verve* without end,
or it would fear *emptiness* and *cessation*,
and *not* become the *Spirit*.

○ **Master Cheng’s Exegesis**:
*Xiē* means *abandonment*.
The *Spirit*, if it does not *depend* on the *Dao*,
would fear its *wisdom* *applied* becoming *foolish* and *faltering*—
once it lacks *precision* and *efficacy*,
it would fear *abandonment* and *cessation*.

The *Valley* without *fullness* would fear *exhaustion*—
○ **Imperial Annotation**:
*Admonishing* it to *not cling* to its *satisfaction* with *fullness*.

○ **Imperial Exegesis**:
It states that the *Valley*, having attained the *Dao/Way*’s *use*,
can *receive* *emptily*—
it must *forget* its *fullness* and *satisfaction*,
for if one *fixates* on *using* its *fullness*,
it would fear *reaching* *dryness* and *exhaustion*,
and *not* become *flowing* and *moistening*.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** says:
The *Valley* must have *fullness* and *contraction*,
*emptiness* and *reality*—
it cannot be that one *only* desires *fullness* without end,
or it would fear *dryness* and *exhaustion*,
and *not* become the *Valley*.

○ **Master Cheng’s Exegesis**:
*Jié* means *blockage*.
It says that when *Rivers* and *Valleys* *deviate* from *unity*,
*calamities* and *disasters* arise,
leading to *springs* and *sources* *drying* up,
and *channels* *not flowing*.

All *things* without *means* of *generation* would fear *extinction*—
○ **Imperial Annotation**:
*Admonishing* them to *not cling* to their *useful* *generation*.

○ **Imperial Exegesis**:
It says that all things, when they attain the *Dao* and its *use*,
and are able to *generate* and *nourish*,
must *forget* their *generation*—
if they *fixate* upon it and *cling* to it,
they would fear *falling* into *death* and *extinction*,
and *not* become *living* and *sentient*.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** says:
All things must *follow* the *times* of *death* and *birth*;
they cannot *always* be *born*—
if they *only* desire *constant* *birth*,
they would fear *extinction* and *not* become *things*.

○ **Master Cheng’s Exegesis**:
All things attain *Oneness* and thus *are born*;
if they *lose* the *Dao* and *deviate* from *Truth*,
then *death* and *extinction* would come in an instant.

**Noble lords** must *not* *fixate* on their *nobility* and *height*,
or they would fear *falling* and *ruin*.

○ **Imperial Annotation**:
Those who attain *Oneness* must *not* *fixate* on its *use*—
thus it is *admonished* that *Heaven* must *not* *fixate* on its *clarity*,
or it would fear *fragmentation*;
that *Earth* must *not* *fixate* on its *tranquility*,
or it would fear *dissipation*;
that *Spirit* *fixates* and *soul* *lingers*,
that *Valleys* *fixate* and *dryness* *exhausts*,
that *things* *fixate* and *life* *perishes*—
and noble lords *fixate* on their *nobility*,
then they would fear *overthrow* and *ruin*!

The *Sacred Teachings* descend to the world,
originally for the sake of *living beings*—
though they *extend* to *Heaven* and *Earth*’s *clarity* and *tranquility*,
they *ultimately* converge upon noble lords *guarding* *femininity* and *stillness*.

○ **Imperial Exegesis**:
*Ruination* means *overthrow*.
It says that noble lords, when they attain the *Dao*’s *use*,
and become *lords* of the *world*,
must *forget* their *honor* and *glory*,
and *humble* themselves to *nurture* [the people].
If they *fixate* on their *nobility* and *exaltation*,
they would fear *overthrow* and *ruin*,
and *not* be able to *stabilize* the *world*.

The *Annotation* says:
The *Sacred Teachings* descend to the world,
originally for the sake of *living beings*—
as the *Book of Documents* says:
*“Heaven generates all things, but only humans are sentient.”*
The *First Sovereign* acts as *parent*—
thus it is known that the *Sacred Teachings* belong to *one* person.
Though they begin by *admonishing Heaven* and *Earth*
to *forget* their *clarity* and *tranquility*,
they ultimately *admonish* noble lords
to *not* *fixate* on their *transformative* and *nurturing* *virtue*.

The *use* of the *Dao* of *humility* is fully elaborated below.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** says:
Noble lords must *bend* themselves and *submit* to others,
*earnestly* seeking the *virtuous*—
they must *not* *only* desire to *exalt* themselves above others,
or they would fear *overthrow* and *losing* their *position*.

○ **Master Cheng’s Exegesis**:
*Ruination* means *defeat*.
If rulers cannot *use* the *Dao* to *guard* their *nobility*,
and *deviate* from *principle* and *contradict* *virtue*,
they would fear the *Sacred Vessel* being *overthrown*,
and the *altars* *tilting* in *danger*—
*Xià Jié* and *Yīn Zhòu* were such men.

**Thirdly**, it clarifies the *use* of the *Dao* in *humility*,
concluding the meaning of *attaining Oneness*.

Thus, *nobility* takes *lowliness* as its *root*,
and *height* takes *humility* as its *foundation*.

○ **Imperial Annotation**:
Noble lords are *noble* and *exalted*,
while the *common folk* are *lowly* and *humble*—
for those who *govern*, the *people* are the *root* and *foundation*.
They must *toil* in *humility* to *gather* the people,
so that they *rejoice* in the *harmonious* and *easy* *transformations*,
and *not* *dispersion*.

○ **Imperial Exegesis**:
*Nobility* refers to noble lords,
*lowliness* to the *common folk*—
it says that noble lords *obtain* their *nobility* *through* the *common folk*,
thus knowing that *lowliness* is the *root* and *foundation* of *nobility*.

As the *Book of Documents* says:
*“The people are the *root* of the state;
the *root* firm, the state is *tranquil*.”*
The *Annotation* says:
*“So they *rejoice* in the *harmonious* and *easy* *transformations*”*—
as the *Book of Odes* says:
*“The *harmonious* and *easy* noble one,
is the *parent* of the people.”*
*Harmonious* means *joyful*,
*easy* means *gentle*.
It says that the noble one has *joyful* and *gentle* *virtues*,
*nurturing* the people,
so the common folk *think* of them
as children think of their *parents*.
If their *virtues* are *opposite* to this,
then the people would *scatter*.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** says:
Thus, *nobility* takes *lowliness* as its *root*—
it says that those who *must* be *exalted* and *noble*
should take *humble* and *lowly* things as their *root*—
like *Yǔ* and *Shī* *personally* *plowing*,
*Shùn* *molding* by the *riverbank*,
and the *Duke of Zhōu* *dwelling* in *white-walled* huts.

*Height* takes *humility* as its *foundation*—
it says that those who *must* be *exalted*
should take *humility* as their *foundation*—
like *building walls* and *constructing* *works*,
*elevating* from *lowliness*—
if the *foundation* is *not* *firm*,
then *ruin* will *inevitably* come.

○ **Master Róng** says:
Thus, *nobility* takes *lowliness* as its *root*—
this means the *state* takes the *people* as its *root*,
also saying that *nobility* comes from *lowliness*.
*Height* takes *humility* as its *foundation*—
even the *nine-tiered* *palace*
begins with *accumulated* *earth*.

○ **Master Cheng’s Exegesis**:
Thus, *nobility* takes *lowliness* as its *root*—
*nobility* means *exalted* and *high*,
*lowliness* means *humble* and *low*.
The ruler who attains *Oneness*
thus is able to *humble* himself.
The ruler who *loses* the *Dao*
must *necessarily* become *proud* and *arrogant*—
thus it is known that *arrogance* is the *foundation* of *lowliness*,
and *humility* is the *root* of *nobility*.
*Measuring* *gain* and *loss*,
therefore, such *admonitions* exist.

*Height* takes *humility* as its *foundation*—
even the *hundred-zhang* *height*
originates from a *single basket* of earth—
to illustrate that *nobility* and *lowliness*
take *humility* as their *foundation*.

Therefore, noble lords *call* themselves *“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”*—
is this not taking *lowliness* as their *root*?
Is it not?

○ **Imperial Annotation**:
*“Lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”*—
these are what *common* people *despise*,
yet noble lords *use* them as their *titles*—
clearly, they *humble* themselves to *nurture* [the people],
and *do not* *fixate* on their *exaltation*.

*Is it not?*—
a *rhetorical* question,
to which the answer is: *“Indeed, it is taking lowliness as the root.”*

○ **Imperial Exegesis**:
*Therefore*—
concluding the *previous* meaning.
Noble lords *call* themselves *“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”*—
as the *Zuǒ Zhuan* records:
*“I, the lonely one, with my few ministers, grieve over lost plans.”*
Those who *call* themselves *“the widowed”* follow the *example*
where the *former sovereign* praised *“the widowed”* as *virtuous*.
Those who *call* themselves *“not-grain”* follow the *example*
where *“not-grain”* *hated* his *lack* of *sincere virtue*.

Again, according to *rites*,
a *son* does *not* call his *father* *“lonely”*,
a *wife* does *not* call her *husband* *“widowed”*,
and *“grain”* means *“to open”*—
*“not-grain”* is like *“not-good.”*
All these *three names*,
though *despised* by people,
are *used* by noble lords as their *titles*—
clearly, they *humble* themselves to *nurture* [the people],
and *do not* *fixate* on their *exaltation*.

*Is this not taking lowliness as their root?*
It says: *“If it is not like this, then what is?”*
*Is it not?*—
a *rhetorical* exclamation,
to which the answer is: *“Indeed, it is taking lowliness as the root.”*

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng** says:
Therefore, noble lords *call* themselves *“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”*—
*“lonely”* and *“widowed”* *illustrate* *isolation*,
*“not-grain”* *illustrates* *inability*—
like the *hub* of a *cartwheel*,
*supported* by all the *spokes*.

*Is this not taking lowliness as their root?*
Noble lords, though *most exalted*,
are able to *call* themselves *“lonely”* and *“widowed”*—
is this *not* taking *lowliness* as their *root*?
*—to enlighten the people.*

*Is it not?*
—a *sigh* of *exclamation*.

○ **Master Róng** says:
Therefore, noble lords *call* themselves *“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”*—
*“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain”* are the *humble* *titles* of kings and lords—
this is also *not forgetting* their *root*.

「Is this truly taking *lowliness* as their *root*?
No—it is not that they *actually* take *lowliness* as their *root*.
○ **Master Chéng’s Commentary**:
*"Not-grain"* arises from *unvirtue*.
○ Noble lords and highborn, wise and perceptive, yet indulging in arrogance and self-indulgence—this is the *root* of their ruin. *Humility* is the foundation of true nobility, so they must stoop to embrace the lowly, governing themselves with *lowliness*—thus calling themselves *“lonely,”* *“widowed,”* *“not-grain.”*
Is this not taking *lowliness* as their *root*?
Yet they say *“Is it not?”*—this is merely an exclamatory rhetorical question, as if to affirm: *“Indeed, it is taking lowliness as their root.”*

Thus, *“count the carriages, yet there are no carriages.”*
○ **Imperial Commentary**:
*“Count the carriages”* and there are *“no carriages.”*
The *hub* and *axle* are the *root* of the carriage—
counting *nobility* reveals *no nobility*;
*lowliness* beneath is the *root* of *nobility*.
The *axle* is the *root* of the carriage—
if one *fixates* on it, the carriage is *established*;
*lowliness* is the *root* of *nobility*—
if one *guards* it, *nobility* is *secure*.
This admonishes noble lords:
to take *lowliness* as their *root*—
merely a metaphor for *“counting carriages”* without *carriages*.

○ **Imperial Commentary**:
*“Thus”* continues the preceding thought.
Earlier, it was explained that noble lords *gain nobility through lowliness*—
*nobility* has no fixed form,
its principle is difficult to clarify,
so it borrows *“counting carriages”* as an analogy.
Exhausting the *count* of carriages,
ultimately there is *no name* for *“carriage,”*
yet the *wheel* and *axle* are *falsely* called *“carriage.”*
This metaphorizes noble lords:
counting their *nobility* reveals *no name* for *“noble,”*
yet *lowliness* beneath is *falsely* borrowed as the *root* of their *nobility*.
The *wheel* and *axle* are the *root* of the carriage—
if the *root* is *preserved*, there is a carriage;
if the *root* is *lost*, there is no carriage.
*Lowliness* beneath is the *root* of *nobility*—
if the *root* is *preserved*, there is *position*;
if the *root* is *abandoned*, there is no *position*.
This is said to admonish noble lords:
to cherish and nourish the lowly,
not to abandon the solitary and bereaved.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng’s Explanation**:
*“Thus”* means *“to approach.”*
People approach the *counted carriages*—
as *spokes*, as *wheels*, as *hubs*, as *poles*, as *carriages*—
yet there is *no name* for *“carriage”* itself,
so it *becomes* a carriage.
This illustrates that noble lords,
not clinging to *exalted titles*,
are thus *established* in their *nobility*.

○ **Master Róng says**:
Noble lords are truly *noble* yet *name* themselves *lowly*—
these are *Dao*-realized rulers.
Songs and ballads *praise virtue* yet do not *glorify* them,
for this is *“counting praise” yet there is *no praise*—
*slander* hangs like a *suspended* *jewel*, yet it is not *blame*,
for this is *“counting blame” yet there is *no blame*.
The *Dao*-embodied gentleman
remains unmoved by external *honor* or *humiliation*,
*gain* or *loss*—
his *joy* and *anger* do not show on his *countenance*.

○ **Master Chéng’s Commentary**:
*“Carriage”* means *“chariot.”*
*Spokes*, *hubs*, *rims*—
*falsely* assembled, yet *only* the *name* of *“chariot”* remains.
Count them, and there is *no substance*—
the *Five Aggregates*, the *Four Great Elements*—
all are *illusion*.
Thus, the *body* being *empty* and *void*,
where shall *nobility* be *lodged*?
Therefore, in *nobility*, one must *practice humility*.
One should not be *polished* like *jade*,
nor *rough* like *stone*.

○ **Imperial Commentary**:
*“Polished”* (*liángliáng*)—the *appearance* of *jade*;
*“rough”* (*luòluò*)—the *appearance* of *stone*.
To take *lowliness* as the *root*.

○ **Imperial Commentary**:
*Jade* is *noble*, *stone* is *lowly*—
like *jade*, one *exalts* oneself;
like *stone*, one *humbles* oneself.
Since noble lords take *lowliness* as their *root*,
they must not be *polished* like *jade* in *self-exaltation*,
but rather *rough* like *stone* to *guard humility*.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng says**:
*“Polished”* (*liángliáng*) means *“few”* (in virtue);
*“rough”* (*luòluò*) means *“many”* (in flaws).
*Jade* is *few* in *flaws*, hence *blamed* for being *precious*;
*stone* is *many* in *flaws*, hence *despised* for being *lowly*.
This says: *“Do not wish to be like jade, prized by others,
nor like stone, scorned by others—
but dwell in the *middle*.”*

○ **Master Yán says**:
Neither *few* nor *many*,
neither *noble* nor *lowly*—
without *acting* from the *body*,
the *Spirit* and *Clarity* are *unbound*;
without *acting* from *Heaven*,
one *aligns* with the *ten thousand things*.

○ **Master Róng says**:
*Jade*, *polished* and *few*, is thus *noble*;
*stone*, *rough* and *many*, is thus *lowly*.
*Lowliness* is what people *hate*,
*nobility* is what *things* *attack*—
both are *unstable*.
In *nobility*, yet *humble and retiring*,
one does not wish to be like *jade* under *attack*.
In *lowliness*, yet *aspiring to equality*,
one does not wish to be like *stone* and *abandoned*.
Obtain it with *oneness*,
dwell in it with *moderation*—
only the *highest* and the *lowest*
are *unstable*;
all else is *secure*.

○ **Master Chéng’s Commentary**:
*Jade*—*nobility*.
*Stone*—*lowliness*.
*Polished*—*few*.
*Rough*—*many*.
If one is *internally confused* by the *body*,
*externally misled* by *things*,
then one *values* *lowliness* while *degrading* the *body*.
Now, having *“counted carriages” yet found no carriage**,
one *awakens* to the *emptiness* of *self* and *things*,
thus *transforming* into *equality*—
*nobility* and *lowliness* are *indistinguishable*,
*separating* from *form*, *abandoning* *knowledge*,
*merging* into the *Ultimate Dao*—
thus, one does not wish to be *polished* like *jade* (as *precious*),
nor *rough* like *stone* (as *despised*).

---
**“The Chapter of *Reversal*: The Movement of the Dao”**
This chapter follows the previous,
properly illuminating those who *obtain Oneness*—
*humble* and *vacant*, *using* the *Dao*,
thus it is placed here,
clarifying how such a person,
*descending* from the *root* and *following* the *path*,
*stoops* to respond to the *people*.

This chapter opens into three distinctions.
**First**, it clarifies *compassionate* *salvation* of *things*,
*reversing* the *Sage* to *align* with the *common*.
**Second**, though *teaching* appears in *many forms*,
none surpass *gentleness* and *weakness*.
**Third**, the *Two Forces* and *ten thousand phenomena*
arise from the *Dao*.

**First**, it clarifies *compassionate* *salvation* of *things*,
*reversing* the *Sage* to *align* with the *common*.
Silent and *unmoving*,
ever *congealed* within the *Great Red*,
*Mysterious* yet *nameless*,
*Returning* to *begin* above the *Primordial Blue*.
*Uniting* the *One Qi* of *Origin*,
*Deploying* the *functions* of the *Three Powers*,
*Distinguishing* the *hard* and *soft* of *Heaven* and *Earth*,
*Operating* the *nurturing* of *Yin* and *Yang*.
Making the *Dragon’s head* into *virtue*,
*Alone* bearing *Pei Qiáng*,
the *Tiger* and *Rhinoceros* as *awe*,
*Following* *Dòng Fèng*’s *command*.
*Heaven’s* *writings* *shimmer*—
the *seventy-two* *characters* of *text*,
*Cloud-scripts* *radiant*—
the *eighty-one* *sections* of *mystery*.
*Emperor Yú* of *Xià* *revered* it, his *blessing* *distant*;
*Yǒu Lǘ* *stole* it, his *nation* *perished*.
At the *Jade Pool*, the *Minghu* *feasted*—
the *Han River* questioned *King Zhāo*, who *never returned*.
Thus it is known:
the *essence* of *obtaining the Dao*—
*spirits* and *numina* thereby *bless* people;
the *calamity* of *losing the Dao*—
*portents* and *omens* thereby *destroy* and *extinguish*.

*“Reversal”* means *movement*—
truly as it is said:
*Silent*, the *mystery* is *serene*;
*responding*, it *interacts* with the *common* for *use*.
The *Ultimate Dao* *reverses* and *lends*—
this is indeed *truthful speech*.

**“The Movement of the Dao”**
○ **Imperial Commentary**:
This clarifies *adaptation*—
*“Reversal”* takes *contrary* *principles* to *harmonize* *meaning*.

**“The Movement of the Dao” (Continued)**

**“Reversal of Principle, Unity of Meaning”**
This is how the Sage acts with *adaptation*—
*Adaptation* is the *Dao’s* movement,
hence it is said: *“Reversal”* is the *Dao’s* movement.

**Imperial Commentary:**
This clarifies *adaptation*—
*“Reversal”* takes *contrary* *principles* to *harmonize* *meaning*.
**Imperial Citation:**
*“Reversal”* is *adaptation* to *common* *usage* for *meaning*,
*“Movement”* is the name for *change*—
speaking of *adaptation* to the *Dao*.
It is said that *sentient beings* cling to *life* and thereby *lose* the *Dao*,
so the Sage *varies* and *adapts*, ordering *things* to *reverse* *common* *ways* and *align* with the *Dao*.

The *Commentary* says: *“Reversal of Principle, Unity of Meaning”*—
*“Principle”* means *constancy*,
*“Meaning”* means *appropriateness*.
To make the *noble* take the *lowly* as *foundation*,
the *high* take the *low* as *base*,
the *having* take the *non-being* for *use*—
first, it *contradicts* *common* *sentiment*,
then it *conforms* and *unites* with the *Dao*,
hence it is called the *Dao’s* movement.

Confucius said:
*“One may stand with him, but one cannot yet adapt with him.”*
Since *adaptation* to the *Dao* *contradicts* *constancy* and is difficult to grasp,
he used the analogy of the *mulberry tree*:
*“Its flowers reverse before they unite,”*
to illustrate that *adaptation* first *inverts* before it *conforms*.

**Master Hé Shàng** said:
*“Reversal”* means *returning* to the *root*—
the *Dao* moves to *generate* all *things*,
and *abandoning* it leads to *ruin*.

**Master Róng** said:
*“Reversal”* is the *Dao’s* movement,
*“Weakness”* is the *Dao’s* *use*.
The *Dao* employs *gentleness* and *weakness* for *use*—
all *movement* *reverses* *common* *ways*,
for *common* *ways* rely on *rigidity* and *strength*,
and all *things* thereby *lose* the *Dao*.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*“Reversal”* means *returning*.
*“Movement”* means *compassion*.
The *Sage* who *obtains* the *Dao* transcends the *Three Realms*,
yet with *compassion* and *pity* he *enters* the *Three Realms*,
mingling among *existence* and *responding* to *circumstances*—
hence the *Classic* says: *“Returning to the Sun.”*
The second section clarifies that though *teaching* may *vary* in *methods*,
nothing surpasses *gentleness* and *weakness*.
*“Weakness”* is the *Dao’s* *use*.

**Imperial Commentary:**
This clarifies *substance*—
*“Weakness”* takes *gentleness*, *femininity*, and *tranquility*,
for *gentleness*, *femininity*, and *tranquility* are the *Sage’s* *substance*.
To *dwell* in *substance* is the *Dao’s* *constant* *use,
hence it is said: *“Weakness”* is the *Dao’s* *use*.

**Imperial Citation:**
This clarifies the *substance* of the *Dao*—
people all *degrade* the *weak* and *exalt* the *strong*,
thus knowing that the *forceful*, *arrogant*, and *boisterous* are the *common* *ways*.
The *Dao* overcomes the *rigid* with *harmony* and *gentleness*,
thus knowing that *gentleness*, *weakness*, *femininity*, and *tranquility*
are the *Dao’s* *constant* *use,
hence it is said: *“Weakness”* is the *Dao’s* *use*.

**Master Hé Shàng** said:
*“Gentleness* and *weakness* are what the *Dao* *constantly* *uses*,
and thus it endures.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*Responding* to *circumstances* and *setting* *teachings*,
though *methods* may *vary*,
to discuss *appropriately*, nothing surpasses *gentleness* and *weakness*,
hence *gentleness* and *weakness* are taken as the *primary* *means* of *transformation*.

The third section clarifies the *Two Principles* and *ten thousand phenomena*,
which arise from the *Dao*.
All *things* under *heaven* are *born* from *being*,
and *being* is *born* from *non-being*.

**Imperial Commentary:**
As *substance* relates to *adaptation*,
so *non-being* *generates* *being*—
thus, those who *act* with *adaptation* *revere* *returning* to *substance*,
and those who *use* *being* must *depend* on *non-being*.
Yet the *Ultimate Dao* is *empty* and *serene*,
*separate* from *names* and *forms*,
all *dharma-nature* is *void*,
and *things* do not *depend* on each other.
If one can *forget* both *adaptation* and *substance*,
and *obliterate* both *being* and *non-being*,
then one attains *counting* without *counting*,
and may be said to *transcend*.

**Imperial Citation:**
It is said that all *things* under *heaven* with *form*
must *transmit* through *form*—
hence it is said: *“born from being.”*
Exhausting their *substantial* *bodies*,
they must *depend* on *non-being*—
hence *Listed Child* said:
*“Form moves yet cannot generate form, only shadow;
non-being moves yet cannot generate non-being, only being.”*
Thus it is said: *“The *void* is the *root* of *heaven* and *earth*,
*non-being* is the *source* of *ten thousand things.”*
This is spoken to make *sentient beings* *exhaust* the *source* and *recognize* the *root* to *awaken* to the *Dao*.

Since *being* and *non-being* are thus,
so too are *adaptation* and *substance*—
hence the *Commentary* says:
*“Substance* relates to *adaptation* as *non-being* *generates* *being.”*
Again, it says:
*“The *Ultimate Dao* is *empty* and *serene*,
*separate* from *names* and *forms*,
all *dharma-nature* is *void*,
and *things* do not *depend* on each other.”*
This means the *Dao* at its *extreme* is *empty* and *serene*,
neither *adaptation* nor *substance*—
how can it be *named*?
The *true nature* of all *dharma* in *principle*
is neither *being* nor *non-being*,
*cutting off* all *dependence*—
what is said of *“things born from being, being born from non-being”*
are all *approximations* by *analogy*.
If one knows *“counting without counting”*,
then one knows *“counting all *dharma* without *dharma*”**—
how could there be *being*, *non-being*, *adaptation*, or *substance*
that can be said to *generate* each other?
Those who *awaken* to this *principle* may be said to have *fully understood*.

**Master Hé Shàng** said:
All *things* under *heaven* are *born* from *being*—
all *things* under *heaven* arise from *heaven* and *earth*,
and *heaven* and *earth* have *form* and *position*,
hence it is said: *“born from being.”*
*“Being* is *born* from *non-being*”—
*heaven* and *earth* in their *divine* *clarity*,
*fluttering* and *creeping* *things*,
all arise from the *Dao*—
the *Dao* has no *form* or *image*,
hence it is said: *“born from non-being.”*
This speaks of *root* overcoming *flower*,
*weakness* overcoming *strength*,
and *humility* overcoming *fullness*.

**Master Róng** said:
*“Being”* refers to *heaven* and *earth*—
*heaven* and *earth* have *form*,
hence they are called *being*.
*Heaven* covers, *earth* bears,
and *things* thereby *obtain* *life*—
hence it is said: *“born from being.”*
*“Non-being”* refers to the *Dao*—
the *Dao* has no *form* or *appearance*,
its *nature* is *pure* and *empty*,
hence it is said: *“non-being.”*
*Heaven* and *earth* arise from the *Dao*,
and *being* is *born* from *non-being*—
hence it is said: *“The *void* is the *root* of *heaven* and *earth*,
*non-being* is the *source* of *ten thousand things.”*
The *bewildered* *lose* the *Dao* and do not *recognize* the *origin*—
the *Sage* *transmits* *teaching* to clarify the *beginning*.
If one can *return* to the *Dao*,
transcend *birth* and *death*, and *exit* *being* and *non-being*,
then one is *deluded* and *common*,
*entangled* in *being* and *non-being* and *bound* to *birth* and *death*.
*Form* and *spirit* *unite* and *appear* in *form*—
hence it is said: *“born from being.”*
*Form* and *spirit* *disperse* and have no *substance*—
hence it is said: *“born from non-being.”*

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*“Being”* responds to the *Dao*—
this is called the *original* *qi* of *Oneness*.
*“Non-being”* is the *mysterious* *root*—
this is called the *dark* and *silent* *foundation*.
It is said that *heaven*, *earth*, and *ten thousand things*
all arise from the *Dao’s* *response* with *law*—
this *response* to the *Dao* arises from the *mysterious* *root*.
*Original* to the *mysterious* *root* is *ultimate* *non-being*.
From the *Classic of the Way and Its Virtue*, *Volume Eleven*, *Commentary by Mù on the Profound Virtue*, ends.

*Compiled by Qiáng Sīzǐ of Mèngyáng*

**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**

The reason this chapter follows the previous one is that the prior chapter elucidates the *Dao’s* *response* with *law*—both its *trace* and *substance* are wondrous—so this chapter clarifies that the *superior person* can awaken to it, whereas the *inferior* cannot.

Now, examining this chapter, its meaning unfolds in three distinctions:
1. The three kinds of people who hear the Dao possess differing *natures* and *capacities*.
2. Those who embody the Dao conceal their light and obscure their brilliance.
3. The Dao’s transformative *power* gives rise to all myriad things.

**1. The three kinds of people who hear the Dao possess differing *natures* and *capacities*.**

The Dao is set forth in three categories, and people perceive it in myriad ways—
some soar upon the *path* of heaven, their flight surpassing the clouds of the *Great Peng* (鹏),
while others are confined to earthly *traces*, buried for a century beneath the mounds of ants.
The *foolish* adjust to the lowly, while the *virtuous* rise with lofty *qi*—
thus, by the seaside there are those who chase after stench,
and in the imperial halls, those who cherish fragrance.

The *superior sage* diligently practices the Dao,
while the *lowly* clap their hands and mock it—
lost in the *clear spring*, they forever wallow in *muddy waters*.
Ah! When the winds and rains darken the sky,
why does the *phoenix* not stir? Since they do not awaken,
how can the *rat* know what is *ugly*?
The distinctions among these three ranks lie here.

The *superior person* hears the Dao and diligently practices it.
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
*Awakened understanding leads to diligent practice.*

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**
The *superior sage* possesses deep insight and piercing discernment.
Hearing the Dao, they grasp its provisional clarity,
yet its true essence is soft and yielding.
Thus, upon hearing it, they act without pause—
hence it is said: *“stirring and practicing.”*

**Shānshàng Gōng says:**
The *superior person*, upon hearing the Dao,
strives with utmost effort to embody it.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Their faith in the Dao grows ever stronger,
and they practice with resolute will—
unmoved by the shifts of cold and heat,
unshaken even as gold and stone dissolve,
their beginning and end remain constant,
firm and unyielding—
this is what is meant by *“stirring and practicing.”*

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
The *superior* in *capacity* possesses keen wisdom and insight,
yet upon hearing the *Dao’s* ultimate truth,
they awaken to the emptiness of all phenomena—
thus, they exert themselves in study,
never ceasing in their diligence.

The *middle person* hears the Dao—
sometimes it seems to exist, sometimes not.
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
*The middle person* can ascend or descend,
hence their doubt.

Doubt makes it seem as if it exists or does not.
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**
The *moderate* in understanding
have not yet clarified the distinction between clarity and obscurity.
Hearing the Dao’s wondrous *Way*,
they sometimes believe, sometimes disbelieve—
if they grasp its clarity, they hold fast in faith,
but if they fail to see its depth, they doubt and waver,
not yet firmly resolved—
hence it is said: *“sometimes it exists, sometimes not.”*

**Shānshàng Gōng says:**
The *middle person*, upon hearing the Dao,
pursue bodily preservation to extend their life,
and govern their state to achieve great peace—
they rejoice in its existence,
yet when confronted with wealth, desire, or honor,
they may succumb to emotion and lose sight of it.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Like raw silk, they lack constancy,
chasing after the fleeting hues of *Dao* and *non-Dao*—
the *middle person* is undecided,
their heart shifting with their likes and dislikes.
Hearing the *true Dao*,
they preserve their life to stabilize their nation—
then they uphold the Dao and abandon the mundane.
Seeing wealth and desire,
they delight in sensory gratification—
then they cling to the mundane and forget the Dao.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
The *middle* in *capacity* have a balanced intellect,
yet their understanding of principle remains unclear.
Though they hear the Dao,
they cannot fathom its profundity—
if they restrain their emotions and return to the *Way*,
they attain emptiness in that moment,
yet their mind, once touched by worldly dust,
becomes entangled in the realm of *being*—
their resolve is uncertain,
hence it is said: *“exists or does not.”*

The *inferior person* hears the Dao and laughs loudly at it.
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
*They are lost and do not believe,*
hence they mock it.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**
Those of shallow insight do not grasp the Dao’s principle—
hearing it, they dismiss it as empty fancy,
and thus scoff at it.
This is like the *Zhuofu* (章甫) being deemed coarse by the *Yue* people,
or the *Hepu* (和璞) being rejected by the *Chu* kingdom—
hence *Zhuāngzi* says:
*“A rigid thinker cannot be spoken to about the Dao.”*

**Shānshàng Gōng says:**
The *inferior person* is greedy and lustful, craving many things—
seeing the Dao’s softness and yielding,
they call it *frightening and cowardly*,
and when they see its simplicity and plainness,
they deem it *vulgar and crude*—
hence they laugh loudly at it.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Their mind is confused by gain and loss,
they know the near but not the far—
their senses are dull to truth and falsehood,
their understanding shallow, unable to perceive depth.
They only delight in the petty practices of worldly dust,
and mock the vast *Dao* of *emptiness and clarity*.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
The *inferior* in *capacity* are dull and obtuse—
hearing the Dao’s profound and distant truths,
its vast and sweeping words,
they fail to awaken to its meaning,
deeming it empty and fantastic,
and thus slander it, clapping their hands in derision.

**If they do not mock, it is not sufficient to be called the Dao.**
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
*If the Dao is not mocked by the inferior,*
it is not profound and wondrous enough.*

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**
The Dao is *profound and mysterious*—
deep beyond comprehension,
bright yet veiled,
its principles contrary to ordinary perception—
thus, it is mocked.
If the inferior do not mock it,
it lacks subtlety and refinement—
it is merely a shallow, conventional teaching,
not worthy of being called the Dao.

The Dao is not a teaching for the *common* age—
thus, it is mocked by the *lowly and foolish*,
and this is why it is called the *wondrous Dao*.

**Shānshàng Gōng says:**
*If the inferior do not mock it,*
it is not sufficient to be called the Dao.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
The Dao is deep and intricate,
difficult for the inferior to grasp—
its subtlety and mystery
are not easily recognized by the *lowly and foolish*.
Now, if they mock it,
it cannot make the *true* blend with the *muddy*—
rather, it serves to highlight the Dao’s purity and distance.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*If the inferior do not mock it,*
it is not worthy to be called the *sage’s Dao*.
**Establishing the true *substance* of the Dao:**

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
*Establishing* means *setting forth*.

Now, setting forth this teaching,
to clarify the differing *paths* of the *superior person*,
the *middle person*, and the *inferior person* toward the Dao.

The *substance* here refers to
the subsequent elucidation of the Dao and other matters.»

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
*"Establishing"* means *"setting forth."* When the Dao is set forth in speech, it is as in the following passage.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Human inclinations vary—
the Sage establishes methods to harmonize divergent hearts.
Without teaching, there is no failing to teach;
yet common sentiments of approval or rejection
may lead to disbelief.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*"Establishing"* means *"setting forth"*—
the Dao practiced by the *superior person* is elucidated below.
*"The substance"* refers to the subsequent passages on the Dao and other matters.

---
**Second, elucidating those who embody the Dao in concealment:**

**The Dao appears as if obscured,**
**Advancing the Dao seems like retreat,**
**The Way of the plain seems like the flawed.**

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
*"The Dao appears as if obscured"*—
the *superior person* acts, yet in clarity, it seems obscured;
in advancement, it seems retreat;
in the plain, it seems flawed.
Thus, the *middle person* doubts it,
while the *inferior* laughs greatly.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
*"Clarity"* means illumination.
*"Obscured"* means dimness.
It speaks of those who cultivate virtue—
nurturing obscurity to achieve clarity,
abandoning form and discarding wisdom,
yet truly illuminated—
hence, *"as if obscured."*
The *superior person*, though diligent in practice,
appears in clarity as if obscured—
the *inferior*, not comprehending, thus mocks it.
The *middle person*, initially hearing of the illuminated Dao,
seems to retain it,
but later, as if forgotten, seems obscured.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
Those who illuminate the Dao
appear as if dark and seeing nothing.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Wisdom is all-encompassing—*clarity*.
Shining without dazzling—*obscured*.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*"Obscured"* means dim.
Those who truly perceive the Dao
conceal their brilliance, blending with the common,
not displaying their clarity,
as if foolish and aligned.

**Advancing the Dao seems like retreat,**
**The Way of the plain seems like the flawed.**

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
Those advancing the Dao
have no inner ambition,
forget external affairs,
daily diminishing fame,
yet great achievement seems lacking—
the *inferior*, observing this, deem it retreat and failure.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
Those who advance the Dao
appear as if lagging behind.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Hearing the Dao and diligently practicing—*advancement*.
Great achievement seeming incomplete—*retreat*.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
The *greatly learned* show no progress—
though internally advancing,
externally they seem to retreat.

**The Way of the plain seems like the flawed,**
**The Dao of equality seems like the uneven.**

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
*"Plain"* means level.
*"Flawed"* refers to uneven silk.
The mind, pure and free of dust,
untainted by desire,
level and unobstructed,
yet externally like uneven silk.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
*"Plain"* means level—
those of the Great Dao
do not distinguish themselves,
appearing like many flawed comparisons.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Level and equal—*the plain Dao*—
harmonizing light with dust,
as if flawed.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*"Plain"* means level—
attaining the Dao of perfect equality,
those who practice know
all beings share the same substance,
seeing no distinction between wise and foolish,
equal in rank and kind.
This meaning—interpreted by Hé, Chéng, and Lǐ—
is the explanation for *"flawed."*

---
**The virtue of the highest is like a valley,**
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
Empty and green, containing all things.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
Those who diligently practice are called *highest virtue*—
their virtue, fully manifest,
contains all without exclusion—
hence, *"like a valley."*

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
Those of highest virtue are like deep valleys,
unashamed by filth and turbidity.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Nothing is excluded.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
Those surpassing in virtue
equal the boundless void,
thus able to contain all things—
like an empty valley.
*"Common"* also written as *"society"*—
speaking of those who can even forget virtue,
not differing from the vulgar.

---
**Great purity seems like disgrace,**
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
Pure yet containing filth.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
*"Pure"* means pristine.
*"Disgrace"* means dust.
Those attaining pristine purity
conceal their traces, blending with dust—
thus called *"as if disgrace,"*
yet truly pure and complete.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
Those of great purity
appear as if stained with disgrace,
not self-displaying.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Coarse yet not impure—*great purity*.
Mixed yet seeming turbid—*as if disgrace.*

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*"Pure"* means pristine and tranquil.
*"Disgrace"* means defiled.
Those of great purity and high conduct
harmonize their light with dust,
do not dazzle others,
thus blend into the waves—
as if stained with disgrace.
Hence, the Eastern Master said:
*"Purify the Dao yet soil its traces"*—
this is the meaning.

---
**Great virtue seems insufficient,**
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
Great achievement yet holding humility.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
Those of ultimate virtue—
their virtue pervades all—*great*.
Guarding softness and practicing humility,
thus always appearing insufficient.
*The Records of the Historian* says:
*"A skilled merchant hides his wealth as if empty;
the virtuous man, though full of virtue,
appears as if foolish."*

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
Those of broad virtue
appear as if foolish and insufficient.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Great fullness seems empty.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*"Great"* means vast.
Those bearing great virtue,
embodying the Dao in emptiness and forgetfulness,
thus internally wise yet externally appearing insufficient.
*The Laozi Transmission* says:
*"A skilled merchant hides his wealth as if empty;
the virtuous man, though full of virtue,
appears as if foolish."*

---
**Establishing virtue seems like theft,**
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
Accomplishing deeds without ostentation.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
*"Establishing"* means *"setting forth."*
*"Theft"* means stealth.
Those establishing hidden virtue
practice secretly,
like thieves who always fear discovery—
thus, *"as if theft."*

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
Those establishing morality
appear as if deceitfully emptied.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Secret practice, covert influence.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*"Theft"* means stealth.
Those establishing great virtue
hide their names, conceal their traces,
like thieves acting unseen—
hence, the Classic says:
*"As if fearing their neighbors."*

---
**True purity seems like theft,**
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
Sincere and harmonizing light.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
*"True"* means pure and unadulterated.
*"Theft"* means transformation.
Those practicing the Dao—
their virtue pure and unadulterated,
yet seemingly transformable,
blending with others while harmonizing their light.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
The unadorned and simple—
if their colors seem to shift,
they are shallow and indistinct.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
*"Shift"* means transformation.
Nature untainted, substance ever-present—
this is true purity.
Forgotten life and death,
united with transformation—
this is *"shift."*

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*"Substance"* means reality.
*"Shift"* means transformation.
Those of innate truth and substance—
still yet moving, true yet responsive,
their transformations reveal impermanence—
thus, they seem to *"shift."*

**The Great Square has no corners,**
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
It does not erect rigid boundaries.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
*"Square"* means upright.
*"Corners"* means angles.
To polish one’s name and principles
to erect rigid boundaries—
these are the Eastern Teachings’ adherents,
not the true Great Square.
Ground smooth yet unbroken,
dwelling in mud without staining—
this is the Great Square.
Yet harmonizing light with dust,
not distinguishing itself—
no corners.
Thus, *"The Great Square has no corners."*

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
The truly upright and square
have no crookedness or sharp angles.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
The cosmos manifests forms,
it has squares.
The Supreme Dao is formless—
no corners.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*"Corners"* means angles.
Those embodying the Dao’s vast wisdom and elegance—
following naturally, conforming to things,
not clinging to principles or erecting angles—
this is called *"transcending principles."*

**Great vessels take long to mature,**
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
And yield no immediate gains.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
Vessels hold all things;
because of their lateness, they achieve greatness.
Thus, the superior sage diligently practices,
accumulating merit to attain realization—
gradual, not achieved in a day.
Hence, *"late maturity."*

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
Great vessels—
like the Nine Tripods and jade ornaments—
cannot be rushed to completion.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Habits solidify over time,
perfection lies in duration—
thus, cultivation cannot be achieved in a single day.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
The Nine Tripods and jade ornaments
are not completed in a day—
a parable for the truly great:
not attained by hasty effort,
requiring eons of refinement
to reach the utmost void—
as with the Master of the Empty Boat fishing.

**Great sound is rare in voice,**
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
It does not adorn with frivolous words.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
The Dao responds to all sounds—
great sound.
Listening, yet no voice—
rare in voice.
Thus, the Sage expounds the One Vehicle:
its law resounds widely,
awaiting awakening to respond—
hence, *"rare in voice."*

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
Great sound is like thunder—
it moves when the time is right,
a metaphor for constant love of *qi* and rare speech.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
The great bell tolls in rhythm,
the Mysterious Teaching acts according to circumstances.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*"Rare"* means nonexistent.
The Supreme Dao’s great sound—
silent, yet without sound,
from origin to manifestation—
soundless sound.
Thus, Zhong Ziqi heard nothing,
yet the jade resonance shook the cosmos.
To clarify: it is both trace and origin—
hence, *"great sound is rare in voice."*

**Great form is formless,**
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
Thus, it can respond to all kinds.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
Those bound to form and substance
are confined to one aspect.
Only the Dao of Great Form—
originally formless,
responding as it is sensed,
shaping all forms—
hence, *"great form is formless."*

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
Those embodying the Great Law’s form
are simple, without embellishment.

**Lǐ Róng says:**
Great form is formless,
the Dao is hidden, nameless.
The void encompasses all forms—
thus, *"great form,"*
great form without form—
hence, *"formless."*
Form cannot be concealed—
thus, *"the Dao is hidden,"*
cut off from designation—
hence, *"nameless."*

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
The Dao’s great form—
form yet formless.
Formless yet form—
formless.
Even Zhuli’s keen eyes could not perceive its form.
Its colors fill the void—
to clarify: it is both having and not having—
hence, *"great form is formless."*

**The Dao is hidden, nameless.**
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
Its functions are not displayed.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
If we call its pervasive generation *"Dao,"*
forgetting its functions—
this is hidden, nameless.
Desiring to name it to describe its substance,
yet its mystery is formless—
thus, it cannot be named—
hence, *"the Dao is hidden, nameless."*

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
The Dao is concealed,
so no one can name it.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
The Supreme Dao’s mystery—
profound, hidden, and obscure—
beyond form and substance’s measure,
how could names and speech define it?

**A third sigh at the Dao’s creative power.**
Only the Dao
is both generous and accomplished—
**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
Though hidden and nameless,
it truly generously endows all with harmonious, wondrous use
and brings them to fulfillment.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
This concludes the Dao’s functions.
*"Ah!"*—a sigh.
*"Only"*—exclusive.

The lending is giving and bestowing.
This Dao, though nameless and formless,
without shape or sound,
alone spreads *qi* and transforms,
lending and bestowing upon all things,
bringing them to fulfillment—
thus, *"generous in lending and accomplished."*

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
*"Fulfillment"* means completion.
The Dao generously lends its vital essence to all
and brings them to completion.

**Master Róng says:**
Advancing yet appearing to retreat—
advancing without advancing.
Retreating yet appearing to advance—
retreating without retreating.
Illuminating yet appearing obscure—
not true illumination.
Obscure yet appearing illuminated—
not true obscurity.
The Supreme Dao is neither advancing nor retreating,
neither illuminated nor obscure,
without color, without sound,
without form, without name.
Though nameless, what name does it not establish?
Though formless, what form does it not manifest?
Thus, it spreads *qi* and transforms,
lending life to all existence,
acting yet not relying,
entrusting to the natural order.

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
*"Lending"* means borrowing.
This nameless Dao possesses great compassion,
thus it descends to save all beings,
borrowing its virtuous power
to shelter all creatures,
nurturing the Three Realms,
employing myriad expedients
to guide them toward fulfillment.

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Generates One**

This chapter follows the previous,
for the prior expounds the Dao’s transformative power—
generous in lending, accomplished in creation—
thus this chapter clarifies what it generates,
though without sequential order.

Its meaning unfolds in three distinctions:
First, it reveals the Dao’s transformative power in generation,
Second, it displays the nature of things and exhorts adherence to harmony,
Third, it elaborates on gentleness and weakness as the foundation of cultivation.

**First: Revealing the Dao’s Transformative Power in Generation**

From the One *qi*, refined,
its principle penetrates the mysteries of subtlety.
The Three Pure Ones emerge first,
their essence returning to the Supreme Void.
Some ride cloud-dragons through the Great Net,
yet unseen when viewed;
some strike zithers and drums to ascend the Precious Realm,
yet unheard when listened to.
Vacuous and insubstantial, they emerge among mortals;
serene and silent, they transcend all forms.
Though chariots and cavalry fill the roads,
Laozi dines with the common folk at the lips of the people,
yet moves without exertion.
The Celestial Sovereign sits upon the dust of the earth—
thus it is known:
the Dao generates the Three Blows, embracing yin and yang,
all receiving the harmonious, stabilizing power of the True Mystery.

The Dao generates One,
One generates Two,
Two generates Three,
Three generates all things.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
The Dao generates One—
One generates Two—
One is the harmonious *qi*.
The Dao emits harmonious, wondrous *qi*,
yet insufficient for generation,
so it generates yang *qi*.
Yang *qi* alone cannot sustain life,
so it generates yin *qi*.
Accumulating the One’s harmonious *qi*,
thus it is said, *"One generates Two."*
Accumulating the Two’s yang *qi*,
thus it is said, *"Two generates Three."*
Three generates all things—
yin and yang embrace and conceive,
harmonious *qi* adjusts and refines,
thus it is said, *"Three generates all things."*

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
The Dao is the divine origin of the utmost vacuity,
One is the refined essence of harmonious *qi*,
*"Generate"* means dynamic emergence.
The Dao dynamically emits harmonious *qi*
to generate all things.
Yet in its transformative principle,
this alone is insufficient—
it further generates yang *qi*.
Accumulating yang *qi* to complete the One,
thus it is called *"Two."*
Pure yang alone cannot generate,
so it generates yin *qi*.
Accumulating yin to complete the Two,
thus it is called *"Three."*
Three generates all things—
when yin and yang harmonize,
harmonious *qi* becomes pure,
thus all existence is born.
This clarifies the meaning:
the Dao’s transformative power is generous in lending and accomplished in creation.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
*"The Dao generates One"*—
the Dao’s first generation is One.
*"One generates Two"*—
One generates yin and yang.
*"Two generates Three"*—
yin and yang generate the Three Pure *qi* of clear and turbid,
dividing into Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.
*"Three generates all things"*—
Heaven, Earth, and Humanity together generate all things.
Heaven bestows, Earth transforms,
Humanity nurtures them.

**Master Róng says:**
*"The Dao generates One"*—
from the void, *qi* stirs, hence *"the Dao generates."*
Undifferentiated primordial *qi*, hence *"One."*
*"One generates Two"*—
clear and turbid separate, yin and yang manifest.
*"Two generates Three"*—
the Two *qi* operate the Three Realms.
*"Three generates all things"*—
the round Heaven covers above,
the square Earth bears below,
Humanity governs between—
what thing does not arise?

**Master Chéng’s Commentary:**
One is the primordial *qi*.
Two is yin and yang.
Three is Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.
All things are all sentient and insentient beings.
The Supreme Dao’s mysterious origin,
its essence transcending form and name,
descending from its root,
first generating primordial *qi*,
then from primordial *qi* transforming into yin and yang.
Thus, yang *qi* ascends, clear and pure, becoming Heaven,
yin *qi* descends, turbid and heavy, becoming Earth.
The Two *qi* ascending and descending,
harmonious *qi* becomes Humanity—
the Three Realms arise,
then all things are generated in sequence,
to illustrate the Dao’s power of generous lending.

---
**Second: Displaying the Nature of Things and Exhorting Adherence to Harmony**

All things embrace yin while cradling yang,
harmonious *qi* as their balance.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Gloss:**
All things, by receiving yin and yang’s harmonious *qi*,
are generated—
thus they embrace yin and cradle yang,
nurturing harmonious *qi* as their gentleness.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Citation:**
Things, in their generation,
rely on yin and yang’s harmonious *qi* to be complete—
they must bear yin and embrace yang,
cherish harmonious *qi* as their gentleness.
Thus, Guangchéngzǐ instructed the Yellow Emperor:
*"I guard the One and embrace harmony,
thus my cultivation has reached twelve hundred years,
yet my form has never decayed."*
It is known that primordial *qi*, harmonious and gentle,
is what all creatures depend upon.
Laozi cites this to show:
since humanity abandons harmonious *qi* to generate,
*qi* is the foundation of life—
thus, one must preserve gentleness and weakness,
this is preserving the root.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
All things embrace yin while facing yang—
all things without fail embrace yin and turn toward yang,
their hearts returning to the sun.

The harmonious *qi* of the **Chong** is the foundation of all things—
within every creature lies primordial *qi*,
which, when balanced and gentle, sustains life.
As in the chest where essence is stored,
or in bones where marrow resides,
or in plants where hollow spaces allow *qi* to flow—
it is through this void and *qi* that longevity is attained.

**Master Róng says:**
If yang *qi* is hot and solitary,
it cannot generate life;
if yin *qi* is cold and lone,
it cannot form shape.
Thus, one must align with the **Great Dao** to harmonize it,
borrow the **Chong** *qi* to balance it—
this is how life is sustained.

**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:**
All things bear yin and embrace yang—
*bear* means to turn away, *embrace* means to face.
Yang is life, yin is death.
All things, sentient or not,
without fail turn away from yin and toward yang,
cherishing life and shunning death—
yet though they shun death, they cannot escape it,
and though they love life, they never fully attain it.
The Sage pities them, thus below follows the discourse on eternal life.

The **Chong** *qi* is harmony—
*Chong* means central, *he* means compliant.
To seek immortality, one must hold the heart upright,
practicing humility, gentleness, and weakness—
this is the way of eternal life.
Hence it is said below:
*"The rigid and strong are doomed to death,
the gentle and weak are destined to life."*

**Third Discourse on Gentle Weakness as the Foundation of Practice:**
What humanity despises—
the titles *Naolǎo Bùgǔ*—
are adopted by kings and nobles as their own.
**御注:** All things rely on the harmonious *qi* of the **Chong** as their root,
and those who preserve its gentle weakness must cultivate humility.
Thus, though kings and nobles hold the highest rank,
they adopt the titles *Naolǎo Bùgǔ*—
for humility and gentleness are their foundation.

**御疏:** The **Chong** *qi* is gentle and weak,
the root of life—
thus kings and nobles uphold humility to reinforce this principle.
*Naolǎo Bùgǔ* are terms of misfortune,
not titles of honor,
yet they are embraced by kings and nobles—
this is the ultimate in humility.
Kings and nobles are the models of civilization,
their fate determining life and death for all under heaven.
If they do not uphold gentleness to secure the realm,
the people will not follow.
Thus, they take humility as their root,
to achieve their towering virtue.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
*Naolǎo Bùgǔ*—terms of ill omen—
are adopted by kings and nobles as their titles,
for they embody humility,
conforming to emptiness, harmony, and gentleness.

**Master Róng says:**
Those who embrace the harmonious **Chong** *qi*
hold neither preference nor aversion.
If one strays from the **One Principle**,
love and hatred arise.
Yet those who cling to titles of wealth and honor
do not delight in *Naolǎo Bùgǔ*—
only the Daoist kings and nobles
preserve themselves through these names,
for humility and retreat are their essence.

**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:**
Loneliness and widowhood are misfortunes,
yet kings and nobles adopt them as their titles—
this shows that nobility lies in embracing what is low,
and exaltation rests on what is humble.
Thus, those who seek cultivation must govern their hearts with humility and compliance.

Things may be diminished yet flourish,
or increased yet decline.
**御注:** Those who diminish themselves are benefited by others;
those who seek self-gain are diminished by others.
Thus, those who submit to the **Dao** are good at yielding,
and gentleness holds the power of virtue.
The titles *Naolǎo Bùgǔ* are fitting.

**御疏:** *Gu* (故) continues the previous thought.
*Shǔn* means to belittle or disparage.
Kings and nobles adopt the titles *Naolǎo Bùgǔ* to disparage themselves,
and thus the people joyfully promote them,
revering and serving them—
their governance is thereby strengthened.
Or, if they enrich themselves while in power,
growing arrogant, the people scatter and governance weakens.
As the *Shū* says:
*"Fullness invites loss, humility invites gain."*
This is the meaning.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
Thus, things may be diminished yet benefit,
or drawn yet resist—
pushed, they return.
Or they may be increased yet decline—
the higher they rise, the more they crumble;
those who feast on wealth and honor see their governance fade.

**Master Róng says:**
The Daoist king, though wealthy and honored,
adopts the titles *Naolǎo Bùgǔ*—
this is diminishment.
Yet his humility shines anew each day—
this is benefit.
Without virtue, one clings to empty honor,
elevating oneself only to fall—
this is diminishment.

**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:**
Humility and gentleness diminish the self to benefit others—
others will gather to it, thus preserving life.
Arrogance and boasting benefit the self while oppressing others—
others will resist it, leading to peril and ruin.
Peril and ruin are diminishment;
preserving life is benefit.
The verification of gain and loss is thus clear—
hence it is said: *"Diminish and yet benefit, increase and yet decline."*

The teachings given to others
are also my teachings.
**御注:** Laozi says:
When rulers wish to establish teachings for the people,
they must use my principles of gentle weakness and humility to instruct them.

**御疏:** *Rén* refers to the ruler.
The ruler is the first to set the example in governance,
and the moral character of the nation depends on one person’s transformation.
Thus, Laozi emphasizes:
When rulers wish to implement teachings to transform the people,
they must use my principles of emptiness, humility, and gentle weakness to guide them.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:**
*The teachings given to others*—
this refers to how the common people teach one another,
shifting from weakness to strength,
from gentleness to rigidity.
*I also teach them*—
meaning I teach the people to shift from strength to weakness,
from rigidity to gentleness.

**Master Róng says:**
When asked about the teachings to be practiced,
they align with *rén* (benevolence) and *yì* (righteousness),
yet rigidity and strength are the path of death,
while benevolence and righteousness are the adornments of the **Dao**.
*Also my teachings*—
meaning to abandon rigidity and strength,
to preserve gentleness and weakness,
to distance oneself from benevolence and righteousness,
and to rest in **Dao** and virtue.
It is also said:
The Sage is the teacher,
the masses are the taught—
the teacher and taught must align properly.
*Yì* means proper.

**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:**
Common scholars and Confucian teachers also uphold gentleness,
yet my teachings emphasize stillness and retreat.
Though their gentleness may still cling to rigid doctrines,
my stillness and retreat value emptiness and forgetting—
thus, they differ.

The strong and violent shall not die their natural death.
**Master Yu’s Annotation:** Those who are strong and violent act in opposition to all things, seeking gain while causing harm. When others strike back, they do not die their natural death.

**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** "Strong and violent" refers to those who are harsh, domineering, and inflexible. Such violent men neglect the essentials of nurturing life and will inevitably cut short their natural lifespan, dying before their time rather than in old age. The annotation states: "They act in opposition to all things, and others strike back." *Antagonize* means *to oppose*; "others strike back" is as in the *Yì Jīng* (Book of Changes), *Yì* (Benefit) Hexagram, Upper Nine line: "No benefit comes to him, others strike him."

**Master Hé Shànggōng** said: "The strong and violent are those who reject the mysterious and profound, who rebel against virtue and the Dao, who do not follow the teachings, and who rely on power and force. To not die their natural death means they are cut down by Heaven’s decree, felled by weapons, or executed by royal law, unable to die in their appointed time."

**Master Yán** said: "Strong Qin perished through tyranny, while Great Han flourished through harmony and compliance. The strong and violent lose the Dao; the rigid and hasty lose their spirit—how could they endure?"

**Master Róng** said: "The strong and violent shall not die their natural death—I shall take this as my teaching’s foundation. Those who do not obey their sovereign and parents, who do not follow the Sage’s teachings, who indulge in empty glory and cling to victory, who exalt themselves and oppress others—these are the strong and violent. They violate laws and transgress statutes, do not fulfill their allotted years, and die prematurely, not attaining their natural death.

All things conform to the Dao; the Sage does not fail to instruct. When human nature strays from reason, the Master of Transformation speaks to them through the sevenfold adornments of virtue, revealing the substance of the Dao. By addressing the nature of the strong and violent, the teachings unfold the method of gentleness and weakness. *Foundation* refers to the origin—taking the strong and violent as the foundation of instruction."

**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:** "The strong and violent shall not die their natural death—I shall take this as my teaching’s foundation." *Strong and violent* is the same as *rigid and hasty*; *foundation* means *beginning*. It states that those who are strong and violent must perish prematurely, unable to die in accordance with Heaven’s decree. Though the Venerable Master expounds many teachings and subtle methods, he consistently upholds gentleness and weakness as good, and rigidity and strength as evil—this is most fitting, making it the first principle for those who seek the Dao. *I shall take this as my teaching’s foundation.*

**Master Yu’s Annotation:** I have seen the strong and violent perish, while the gentle and weak survive; thus, I take this teaching of gentleness and weakness as the foundation for all teachings.

**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** *Foundation* means *origin*. This sentence establishes the root of cultivation. The Venerable Master uses the perishing of the strong and violent as a warning and the survival of the gentle and weak as encouragement. To take this as the foundation of teaching means that, like a child to a parent, this teaching of gentleness and weakness is the origin of all teachings.

**Master Hé Shànggōng** said: *Foundation* means *beginning*. The Venerable Master takes the strong and violent as the initial admonition for teaching.

**Chapter 43: The Most Gentle in the World**
This chapter follows the previous one because the prior chapter clarifies that the teaching of gentleness and weakness is the first principle of seeking the Dao. Thus, this chapter is placed next to further reveal the power of gentleness and weakness and the benefits of *wuwei* (non-action).

Within this chapter, the text has three layers:
1. It presents an analogy to show that gentleness overcomes rigidity.
2. It explains how gentleness and weakness can enter without obstruction.
3. It concludes with a sigh of praise for *wuwei*, calling it a rare and precious teaching.

**First: Presenting an analogy to show that gentleness overcomes rigidity.**
The five elements all have their uses, yet the spirit of water is the most enduring. The four great elements manifest form, yet none surpasses the utmost gentleness. It gallops across the world, surging against the most rigid obstacles—like the August Floods of the eighth month, when the waters of Du Junping rose in Shu, or the autumnal voyages of Meng Qiang entering Qin. The River Peng shines brightly, its clear currents deep and still, reflecting the Dao of water—without intention, yet pure and undivided—thus it can generate gentleness and weakness. Borrowing this as an analogy, its inexhaustible flow draws one near to the Dao.

The most gentle in the world
can gallop across the most rigid in the world.

**Master Yu’s Annotation:** The most gentle in the world is one’s true nature. If one is entangled in worldly affairs, stained by the dust of existence, and overwhelmed by desires, then one becomes the most rigid in the world.

**Master Yu’s Exegesis:** Human nature, in its original state, is pure and harmonious. When *qi* is balanced within, it is the utmost gentleness. But if one is swept away by desires, stained by worldly attachments, and seduced by sounds and colors, then true nature disperses, becoming the utmost rigidity.

**Master Hé Shànggōng** said: The most gentle is water; the most rigid is metal and stone. Water can penetrate rigidity and enter hardness—there is nothing it cannot pass through.

**Master Yán** said: The Dao can traverse and govern all things under Heaven.

**Master Róng** said: Among tangible things, the most gentle is water. Among the formless, the most gentle is the Dao. Water, though most gentle, can dissolve metal and pierce stone, breaking through rigidity. The Dao, though most gentle, can abandon the self and others, breaking through fixed attachments. If one mirrors oneself in water and embodies the Dao, one can penetrate the distinctions of self and others, traverse mountains and valleys without obstruction—this subtle and mysterious passage is the galloping across the utmost rigidity.

**Master Chéng’s Exegesis:** The most gentle is water; the most rigid is metal. *Galloping* means *attacking and penetrating*. It states that water, though most gentle, can attack and penetrate the rigidity of metal, illustrating how *wuwei*, though seemingly weak, can break the burdens of *youwei* (action). Hence, the following text says: "In the world, nothing is more gentle than water, yet in attacking rigidity, nothing surpasses it."

**Second: Explaining how gentleness and weakness can enter without obstruction.**
There is nothing that can enter without obstruction.

**Master Yu’s Annotation:** There is nothing that can enter without obstruction—I know this to be the benefit of *wuwei*. *There is nothing* means not being stained by the dust of existence, making the heart empty of all attachments. *Without obstruction* refers to the Dao’s pure and undivided nature, its mysterious and unified body, with no gaps or separations. If one is not disturbed by desires, making both heart and environment still, empty of all attachments, then the heart aligns with the Dao and enters without obstruction.

Thus the Sage says, *"I see that when the body and mind are pure and clear, they naturally align with the Dao—this is how I know that the teachings of *youwei* are inferior to *wuwei*."*

**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
*"Wuwei"* refers to one who awakens to all dharmas, empty of all attachments, and thus returns to their original nature, merging with the Dao and entering *wujian*.
*"Wujian"* is the Dao. *"Ru"* means "to merge."
The Dao is called *wujian* because its nature is pure and boundless, unified without gaps or separations.

**River Upper Master says:**
*"Wuwei"* is the Dao. The Dao has no form or substance, thus it can move freely without obstruction, transcending the spirit and benefiting all beings.

**Yan says:**
The spirit and clarity reside within the body, moving without obstruction—this is the benefit of *wuwei*.

**Rong says:**
Water encounters no obstruction; the Dao has no form. Where there are no gaps, it enters everywhere.

**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**
*"Jian"* means "gap." Those lost in illusion see emptiness as existence, while those of enlightened vision see existence as emptiness—thus, *"wuwei."*
The teachings of *youwei* are flawed and thus have gaps, while *wuwei* is subtle and seamless, allowing one to enter the profound truth of *wuwei* and *youwei* as one.
This is why I know the benefit of *wuwei*.

**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
*"Wu"* refers to Laozi speaking of himself. This chapter also instructs rulers, teaching them to govern the world through *wuwei*.
Thus Laozi says, *"I see that all beings possess a natural gentleness, but when they chase after ambition and competition, they become rigid and strong. If one illuminates and awakens the mind, empty of all attachments, they will merge with the Dao."*
This shows that the principle of *wuwei* and purity benefits both governance and the self, and is more beneficial to people than the teachings of *youwei*.

**River Upper Master says:**
*"I see that the Dao acts through *wuwei*, yet all things are spontaneously transformed—this is how I know the benefit of *wuwei* for people."*

**Rong says:**
The Dao is formless, yet things are formed; the Sage acts through *wuwei*, yet people are transformed—this is the benefit of *wuwei*.

**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**
Gentleness can overcome rigidity; emptiness can dissolve existence—thus, I know that the teaching of *wuwei* greatly benefits those who cultivate the Way.

**Third: Concluding with a sigh over the rare teaching of *wuwei*.**
The teaching of *wuwei*—unspeakable and beneficial—is rarely attained by the world.

**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
It says that among all teachings in the world, few can attain *wuwei*.

**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
The supreme Dao is wordless; things arise through it. The Sage acts through *wuwei*; transformation is pure. Only when one does not rely on spoken words does teaching take form.
Few in the world can attain it, meaning that among the hundred schools, few can follow the teaching of *wuwei*. Again, it says that unless one embodies the Dao, none can attain it—thus, *"rare."*

**River Upper Master says:**
The teaching of *wuwei* follows the Dao without words, guiding by example. The benefit of *wuwei* is that governing the self strengthens the spirit, and governing the state benefits the people without labor or trouble.
*"Few in the world can attain it"* refers to rulers—few can follow the Dao of *wuwei*. The governance of self and state is the same.

**Yan says:**
The sound that can be heard reaches a hundred *li*, but the soundless sound moves beyond all boundaries.
What is spoken is understood by others, but the unspeakable is subtly expressed—like the response of Heaven and Earth, or the silent workings of the Dao and virtue, where Heaven and Earth act without speech, and the four seasons cycle endlessly.

**Rong says:**
The teaching of *wuwei* and its benefits—previously mentioned—are not yet known. To practice the unspeakable teaching is to forget speech, to follow natural processes is to find no tasks, and thus the ruler is at ease above, the subjects content below—this is the benefit of *wuwei*.
*"Few in the world can attain it"* means many follow *youwei*, but few attain *wuwei*.

**Master Cheng’s Annotation:**
*"Unspeakable"* does not mean closing the mouth. In principle, it is both existence and nonexistence; in teaching, it is both speech and silence—thus called the unspeakable teaching.
It is both existence and nonexistence, thus called the benefit of *wuwei*.
The benefit is not a benefit yet is a benefit; the teaching is not a teaching yet is a teaching—this is the ultimate expression of nature and principle, a rare discourse in the world. Few conventional teachings can reach it, hence *"rare."*

**Chapter Forty-Four: Which is dearer, name or body?**

This chapter follows the previous one, which praised gentleness as the pivot of the Dao, thus explaining that contentment and detachment from desire are essential to true cultivation.

Within this chapter, the text unfolds in three layers:
1. A hypothetical scenario with three questions, weighing gain and loss,
2. An exposition on how clinging to fame and profit harms wisdom and the body,
3. A demonstration that contentment and detachment can lead to longevity.

**First: A hypothetical scenario with three questions, weighing gain and loss.**
Heaven and Earth have form, yet they are uneven—east and west tilt and lack completeness. Yin and Yang contain substance, yet their relationship is like a mother and child, one giving birth to the other, only to perish.
Thus the question arises: *"Which is dearer, name or body? Which is more painful to lose, gain or loss?"*

The virtuous Bo Yi abandoned his noble status at Mount Shouyang, while Wu Zixu, seeking fame, drowned himself in the Yi River.
The Duke of Zhou declined his title, and Emperor Yao refused the throne when offered.
The four sages followed the Way of *wuwei*, while the two men endured hunger and poverty—why?
Because fame and position are hollow; Xiang Yu lamented his lost kin, and wealth and honor harm the body—Confucius sighed at his white hair.
*"Excessive love leads to great loss"*—this is the true saying of the Sage, worthy of sincere belief.

**Which is dearer, name or body?**

**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
*"Name"* is the guest of *"reality."* People sacrifice their bodies for fame—this question asks which is dearer, urging one to abandon功 and 名 (*gong* and *ming*), preserving their true self.

The Master’s Commentary states: Here, fame is weighed against the body. *Na* (孰) means "who." The detailed question asks: If one strives for glory and fame while preserving life, and these two paths are set apart—then which aligns more closely with the Dao of preserving one’s true self and extending years? It laments how people sacrifice their bodies for others’ fame.

Master He Shang said: To retreat from fame is to bathe in virtue.

Master Rong said: Between fame and body, which is dearer? Between body and wealth, which is more abundant? Between gain and loss, which brings greater harm? Fame is the external praise of others; wealth is the common man’s silk and jade. The body is the foundation of loyalty and filiality, the bedrock of virtue and Dao. One must abandon external fame and profit, nurture the body and spirit, return to *wuwei*, cultivate the Supreme Way—yet those who perish forget this, and those who chase desires lose their true nature. Thus, fame becomes the blade that slays the body, and wealth the poison that harms the self. Many are lost in delusion, and the Sage pities them. Hence the detailed question: Is it sickness to seek fame and profit? Is it sickness to lose them? The vulgar see fame and profit as good, yet gaining them brings death, losing them brings virtue. To lose is to stand firm; to gain is to perish. Who can discern the sickness of gain and loss? *Wang* (亡) means "lose."

Master Cheng’s Commentary states: The body is the inner self, the true essence. Fame is external, a guest. *Na* (孰) means "who." All men seek the external while destroying the inner, greedily pursuing fame while losing substance. What is this? Praise and glorious name are originally for the sake of the body—yet if the body dies for fame, to what end does the fame serve?

The Old Master, moved by this inversion, asked: Between fame and body, which do you hold dear—yet you feast on fame while forgetting the body? By this measure, the distinction between dear and distant becomes clear. Hence *Zhuangzi* says: "Bo Yi died for fame beneath Mount Shouyang."

Between body and wealth, which is more abundant?
The Master’s Commentary: Those who pursue fame will seek wealth, yet gaining wealth destroys the body. The question asks which is more, urging one to cast away jade and shatter pearls to preserve harmony.

The Master’s Commentary: "More" signifies what is precious and weighty. When body and wealth are set apart, which should be valued? This is asked to awaken the realization that the body is more precious than wealth. The note on casting jade and shattering pearls comes from *Zhuangzi*’s Outer Chapters.

Master He Shang said: Wealth in excess harms the body.

Master Cheng’s Commentary: Wealth is originally for the body’s use, yet deluded men sacrifice their lives for it. Thus the Old Master reproaches: Do you discard wealth to preserve the body—is that more beneficial? Or hoard wealth while losing the body—is that more beneficial? Hence *Zhuangzi* says: "Zhi the Robber died for profit upon the Eastern Ridge."

Between gain and loss, which brings greater harm?
The Master’s Commentary: It asks whether gaining fame and wealth or losing them brings greater sickness to the body.

The Master’s Commentary: This summarizes the two questions: Does gaining fame and wealth or losing them bring sickness? Gaining them destroys the body; preserving the body means losing them. The distinction is clear—sickness is evident. Yet deluded men fail to awaken first, so the later text elaborates the answer.

Master He Shang said: Coveting gain brings sickness to conduct.

Master Cheng’s Commentary: Those who greedily seek wealth will surely perish, while those with few desires and no wealth preserve their bodies. Thus, gaining is the sign of self-destruction, losing is the proof of self-preservation. Self-destruction is sickness; self-preservation is medicine. Yet the world reverses this, calling gain fortune and loss sickness—is this not perverse? Hence the teaching asks: Between gain and loss, which is truly sickness?

The second point clarifies how indulging in fame and profit diminishes wisdom and harms the body. Therefore, excessive love leads to great loss, and hoarding brings thick ruin.

The Master’s Commentary: Those who love excessively must expend greatly. Those who hoard wealth burden the body—this is thick ruin.

The Master’s Commentary: These two sentences answer the prior questions. "Excessive love leads to great loss" responds to *name and body, which is dearer?* Loss here means "harm." The dearer one holds fame, the more they strain their nature, depleting spirit and mind. The more they love, the greater the expenditure. "Hoarding brings thick ruin" responds to *body and wealth, which is more abundant?* The more wealth is stored, the greater its ruin—whether through theft or grave robbery, the attacks on jade and pearls, or the plundering of books and tombs. The harm of wealth serves as a solemn warning.

Master He Shang said: Excessive love leads to great loss. Those who love beauty excessively drain their vital essence; those who love wealth excessively invite disaster. The less one loves, the less one loses—hence it is called "great loss." Hoarding brings thick ruin: In life, wealth is stored in granaries; in death, in graves. The living face banditry and robbery; the dead face grave desecration.

Master Rong said: Therefore, excessive love leads to great loss—using fame to kill the body is great loss. Hoarding brings thick ruin—using wealth to harm the self is thick ruin.

Master Cheng’s Commentary: Therefore, excessive love leads to great loss. Loss means "harm." This explains fame: Those who excessively love praise and reputation must greatly tax their form and spirit, depleting their vitality and wisdom. This sentence resolves the question of fame.

Hoarding brings thick ruin.
The Master’s Commentary: Those who hoard wealth in granaries will face robbery, not only losing their goods but also endangering themselves. Their ruin is deep and severe. Hence the *Book of Documents* says: "An innocent man with a jade boulder bears guilt." *Zhuangzi* says: "The great scholar recited: 'The green wheat grows on the ridge.' He did not distribute in life, so why hoard pearls in death?" Thus, they struck his jaw with a hammer, pried apart his cheeks—lest the pearl in his mouth remain unharmed. This sentence resolves the question of wealth.

**Third, the enlightened know contentment and abandon greed, thus enduring long.**
Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,
Knowing restraint brings no peril—
thus one endures long.

**Master’s Annotation:**
Knowing contentment means not loving excessively.
Knowing restraint means not hoarding excessively.
Since there is neither disgrace nor peril,
one may endure long.

**Master’s Detailed Commentary:**
Disgrace means loss and burden;
Peril means danger and ruin.
He who does not seek fame is content.
He who does not amass wealth knows restraint.
Knowing contentment, fame aligns with truth without excess burden.
Knowing restraint, wealth is not hoarded, and greed brings no harm.
Without disgrace or peril,
one may endure and live long.

**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**
Knowing contentment brings no disgrace—
the contented cut ties with gain, reject desire,
and suffer no disgrace to the self.
Knowing restraint brings no peril—
when one knows when to stop,
wealth and profit do not burden the self,
and sounds and colors do not confuse the senses—
thus one remains free from danger all life.
Thus one endures long.
If people know restraint and contentment,
fortune and blessings lie within themselves.
For those who nurture their bodies, the spirit labors not;
for those who govern the state, the people are undisturbed—
thus one endures long.

**Honor’s Commentary:**
Knowing contentment brings no disgrace—
not seeking fame beyond measure,
one avoids shame.
Knowing restraint brings no peril—
not scheming for wealth beyond reason,
one avoids danger.
Thus one endures long.
By distancing oneself from fame and profit,
one avoids peril and danger.
In governing the state, one may endure long;
in cultivating the self, one may live long.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Knowing contentment brings no disgrace—
understanding wealth’s falsity,
guarding one’s portion without greed,
pure and serene in contentment,
one knows no shame—
this concludes the discussion on wealth.
Knowing restraint brings no peril—
having awakened to the emptiness of praise,
one stops without attachment,
preserving the self and avoiding harm,
thus suffering no peril.
The previous passage said: *"Fame, once attained, must be known to cease."*
This concludes the discussion on fame.
Thus one endures long—
knowing restraint in fame,
knowing contentment in wealth,
without fame or profit,
one may endure long.

**Chapter Forty-Five: The Great Completion as if Deficient**

This chapter follows the previous one,
for though the previous spoke of knowing contentment and restraint,
it did not yet complete the Dao’s cultivation.
Thus this chapter reveals the Great Completion,
demonstrating the emptiness of false practices.
Within this chapter, three themes unfold:
First, a broad exposition of the Five Great [principles],
as a model for learning and conduct;
Second, parables illustrating how the restless and inferior pale beside stillness;
Third, the culmination of the virtues of stillness.

**First: A Broad Exposition of the Five Great [principles], as a Model for Learning and Conduct**

He who forges the vast furnace,
bearing the Tortoise Mountain and calling it great—
the artisan’s skill is refined;
spanning the realm of Peng’s wings to achieve height.
Encompassing all within the One Qi,
it appears as if deficient—
embracing the seven layers within,
it functions as if empty.
Thus one knows the Emperor’s form, misty and indistinct,
mirroring the void in the palm—
the utmost precision, elusive and vague;
storing the cosmos in the heart’s field.
Stepping through the Dark Path without end,
pushing the Great Bend without measure,
the pure and still wind fans far—
then the Nine Ranks act without effort,
the Way of tranquil ease is vast—
then all the people prosper.
The instrument of Great Completion
is realized here.

**The Great Completion as if Deficient—**
its use is unexhausted.

**Master’s Annotation:**
When learning and conduct reach Great Completion,
they remain as if stained and deficient—
humility brings benefit—
thus their use is never exhausted.

**Master’s Detailed Commentary:**
All who study the Dao,
when their virtues are complete and rounded,
must ever forget themselves,
as if stained and deficient.
Thus their use is endless.
The Sage-King of Great Completion and Virtue
is likewise—
equal to Heaven and Earth in nurturing,
matching the Sun and Moon in illumination,
his achievements vast—
hence, *Great Completion*.
Yet he does not rely on his completion,
remaining as if stained and deficient—
thus his use is unexhausted.

**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**
*The Great Completion as if Deficient*—
the Sage-King of Great Completion and Virtue,
as if deficient—
erasing name, concealing praise,
like a broken vessel.
Its use is unexhausted—
when the heart is thus,
its use knows no end.

**Honor’s Commentary:**
The Dao is complete, virtue fulfilled—
this is Great Completion,
yet it appears as if lacking—
hence, *as if deficient*.
Yet the Great Abyss draws from it without depletion,
the bright mirror reflects without weariness—
its use is unexhausted.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Those whose conduct and practice reach Great Completion
forget their completion,
so though complete,
they appear as if deficient.
Because they forget completion and deficiency,
the more they act, the more their use is unexhausted.
Thus *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Small completion hides the Dao."*
The complete is not deficient,
the deficient is not complete—
yet now the complete appears deficient,
forgetting deficiency and completion.
Not seeing completion as different from deficiency,
it is deficient yet truly complete;
not seeing deficiency as different from completion,
it is complete yet appears deficient.

**The Great Fullness as if Empty—**
its use is unexhausted.

**Master’s Annotation:**
When blessings and position are full,
they remain as if empty—
frugality does not deplete wealth,
thus their use is unexhausted.

**Master’s Detailed Commentary:**
*Empty* means *void*.
*Unexhausted* means *not lacking*.
This illustrates the Sage-King,
whose blessings and position are full,
yet who practices restraint and self-cultivation,
not clinging to fullness—
thus appearing as if empty.
As the *Book of Changes* says:
*"Having yet appearing as if not having,
full yet appearing as if empty,"*
thus their use is unexhausted.

**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**
*The Great Fullness as if Empty*—
the Sage-King of great fullness and virtue,
as if empty—
noble yet not arrogant,
wealthy yet not extravagant.
Its use is unexhausted—
when the heart is thus,
its use knows no end.

**Honor’s Commentary:**
The Four Reaches are present yet illuminate together,
the Six Passages reveal nothing hidden—
this is Great Fullness.
Not using illumination as illumination,
not clinging to fullness as fullness—
this is *as if empty*.
Using without the mind,
thus without limit.

**Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Chong* is *emptiness*.
*Qióng* means *exhaustion*.
It speaks of those whose Dao and virtue are in great fullness—
yet they forget their fullness,
so though full, they appear as if empty and without substance.
Only by forgetting fullness and embracing emptiness
can their use be inexhaustible.

For the full is not empty,
and the empty is not full.
Now, full yet empty—
this is to transcend both fullness and emptiness,
thus being full yet appearing as if empty.

**Great Straightness as if Bent,**
**Yu’s Annotation:**
Straight yet not domineering, hence appearing as if bent.

**Yu’s Commentary:**
*Straight* means *upright*.
*Bent* means *yielding*.
The first four lines elucidate both essence and application;
hereafter, the next three lines speak only of essence, omitting application.
The text is abbreviated to reveal its meaning—
the pattern is clear.

To purify oneself while defiling others,
to uphold rectitude yet place crookedness—
this is *small straightness*.
Not clinging to truth to refute falsehood,
not correcting oneself to rectify others—
this is *Great Straightness*.
Yielding to fit circumstances, hence appearing as if bent.
The annotation says *straight yet not domineering*—
this is the text of the next chapter.

**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**
*Great Straightness* refers to cultivating the Dao’s laws,
upright and unchanging as one.
As if bent—
not contending with the vulgar,
like one who can bend and fold,
leveling shoulders, straightening the body,
the Original One flowing uniformly.

**Honor’s Commentary:**
In darkness, aligned with the True Path—
this is *Great Straightness*.
Following desire to conform to others—
this is *as if bent*.

**Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Bent* means *yielding*.
Those of Great Straightness are plain and unadorned,
not displaying their rectitude openly,
thus blending with the common crowd,
adapting flexibly to all—
hence appearing as if bent.
Thus, *upright in conduct* is *small straightness*.

**Great Skill as if Clumsy,**
**Yu’s Annotation:**
Skill harms through excess, hence appearing as if clumsy.

**Yu’s Commentary:**
Boasting of cosmetic artistry,
flaunting the intricacies of hooks and lines—
this is *small skill*.
Using materials appropriately, entrusting success to things,
never deviating from their nature—
this is *Great Skill*.
Without cutting or shaping,
no trace of craftsmanship remains,
seeming crude and clumsy.
*Zhuangzi* says: *"Nature carves and molds all forms yet does not claim skill."*

**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**
*Great Skill* refers to possessing many talents.
As if clumsy—
pretending not to dare display one’s abilities.

**Honor’s Commentary:**
The artisan completes all things—
this is *Great Skill*.
Seeming unable to act—
this is *as if clumsy*.

**Cheng’s Commentary:**
The artisan completes all things,
the furnace hammers all life—
though possessing great skill, they forget their skill’s use,
obscuring their brilliance to blend with the ordinary,
hence appearing as if clumsy.
*Zhuangzi* says: *"Nature carves and molds all forms yet does not claim skill."*
Thus, it is known that *craftsmanship* is *small skill*.

**Great Eloquence as if Tongue-Tied,**
**Yu’s Annotation:**
Not adorning with frivolous speech, hence appearing as if tongue-tied.

**Yu’s Commentary:**
Combining metaphors, embellishing words,
tying knots in arguments, weaving sentences—
this is *small eloquence*.
Practicing speechless teaching,
eloquently penetrating all things,
exhausting principles, fulfilling nature—
this is *Great Eloquence*.
At its peak, speech departs from speech,
no emphasis or suppression remains,
as if stammering and tongue-tied.

**River-Upper Master’s Saying:**
*Great Eloquence*—
wisdom without doubt.
As if tongue-tied—
no verbal expression.

**Honor’s Commentary:**
Discussing Heaven, expounding principles—
this is *Great Eloquence*.
Speech yet no speech—
this is *as if tongue-tied*.

**Cheng’s Commentary:**
Wondrously dissecting the True Essence,
measuring the Mysterious Extremes—
what they speak cannot be spoken.
Not like worldly eloquence, swift and facile,
hence appearing as if stammering and tongue-tied.
*Zhuangzi* says: *"Unspoken eloquence"*—
also called *Great Eloquence without speech*—
thus it is known that *Yang-Mo’s petty eloquence* is small.

**Second Analogy, Clarifying That Calm Overcomes Agitation,**
**Agitation Overcomes Cold, Calm Overcomes Heat.**
**Yu’s Annotation:**
For agitation to overcome cold—*cold* means *thin*.
For calm to overcome heat—*heat* means *harmony*.
Thus, *as if bent* is *Great Straightness*,
*clear and tranquil* is the *proper measure*.
Agitation overcomes cold—
when form moves, fluids flow and disperse.

**Yu’s Commentary:**
This analogy serves as instruction.

Those who cling to completion must fail,
those who grasp fullness must topple—
thus the Sage’s work perfects the world,
yet sees great completion as if lacking,
so it knows no exhaustion.
In exalted station, ruling ten thousand chariots,
he views the height of power as if empty,
so it knows no depletion.

For fear others may not understand,
he uses the movement and stillness of *yang* qi to illustrate.

*Liao* means movement,
*shèng* means extremity.
When spring and summer, *yang* qi erupts upon the earth,
all things thrive by its force.
When *yang* qi moves to its extreme, cold arises—
cold brings decay and death to all things,
thus proving *liao* as the root of death,
excess as the source of decline,
illustrating that completion without lack must fail,
fullness without emptiness must topple,
and those who act with rigid agitation must perish.

*Jìng shèng rè* means:
in autumn and winter, *yang* qi retreats into the Yellow Springs below,
stillness to its extreme brings heat—
heat, the source of life, gives rise to *qi*,
and all things thrive by it, their birth depending on stillness.
Thus, stillness is the root of life,
also the sovereign of agitation.
Taking this analogy, great completion and great fullness
derive from the ability to lack and to be empty—
thus they know no exhaustion, no depletion,
and achieve life.

Those who can act without striving in purity,
then grasp the root of life.
This exhorts people to prioritize stillness for nurturing life,
not to recklessly agitate toward death.

**River-Upper Master says:**
*Liao shèng hán*—*shèng* means extremity.
Spring and summer, *yang* qi moves violently above,
all things flourish and grow great—
extreme, they grow cold, cold brings withering and death.
This warns against rigid agitation.

*Jìng shèng rè*—in autumn and winter, all things rest in the Yellow Springs below,
extreme stillness brings heat—
heat, the source of life.

**Rong says:**
The two *qi* of yin and yang alternately fulfill their functions—
*yang* qi moves and grows hot,
yin qi is still and grows cold.
When *yang* qi is excessive, heat prevails and cold is weak;
when yin qi is excessive, stillness prevails and agitation is weak.
This is the shifting order of *qi*, their mutual dominance and decline.
Great completion as if lacking,
great fullness as if empty—
then there is no true excess.
Its use knows no exhaustion, no depletion—
then there is no true decline.
Neither excessive nor deficient,
neither cold nor hot,
abandoning completion yet not failing,
forgetting dominance yet not falling short.

**Node Annotation:**
*Jìng shèng rè*—when without action, spirit remains unified.

**Chen’s Commentary:**
*Liao* is *yang*,
*jìng* is yin,
*shèng* is extremity.
The four seasons turn—
yin reaches its extreme, *yang* arises;
*yang* reaches its extreme, yin arises.
Yin’s rise brings universal decay.
*Yang*’s rise brings all things to flourish.
This illustrates that stillness is the foundation of longevity,
agitation the origin of annihilation—
exhorting students to abandon agitation and return to stillness.

**Further Explanation:**
Descending from the root, it is *liao shèng hán*.
Retiring to the source, it is *jìng shèng rè*.
This clarifies the proper timing of movement and stillness.

**Third Section: Concluding the Function of Stillness.**
Purity and stillness are the proper order of the world.

**Yu’s Commentary:**
This concludes the previous meaning.
The Sage observes the advance and retreat of *yang* qi,
knowing agitation as the path to death,
stillness as the root of life.
Guiding people and nurturing all beings,
holding to the root to govern the branches,
practicing the Way of purity and stillness—
thus he becomes the proper order of the world.

**River-Upper Master says:**
To be able to purify and still—
then one becomes the eternal ruler of the world,
upholding rectitude without end.

**Rong says:**
To be moved by the cold and heat of yin and yang—
this is not yet pure.
To be swayed by the flow of life and death—
this is not yet still.
The Sage remains unchanged by life and death,
unburdened by cold and heat—
this is purity and stillness.
With the turning wheel, to dwell in life and death is shameful.
Without the turning wheel, to transcend life and death is the proper order of the world.

**Chen’s Commentary:**
Purity, emptiness, and stillness
can benefit oneself and others,
correcting the crooked—
thus it is the proper order of the world.
This concludes the meaning of stillness overcoming agitation.

**Node Annotation says:**
To attain the Dao and enter the deep mountains,
to guard natural purity and stillness—
this is the True Person.

*Beginning of Volume Thirteen, Mysterious Virtue Compiled Commentary*

(Annotations by He Shang Gong, Yan Junping, Li Rong, and the *Xihua* Master Chen Xuying,
with contributions from Qiang Siqi)

**Chapter Forty-Six: The World Under the Dao**

This chapter follows the previous one,
as the prior passage contrasts the two paths—stillness and agitation—
and their differing outcomes.
Thus, this chapter reveals the distinction between
the world under the Dao and the world without it,
and their respective merits and demerits.

Within this chapter, the text unfolds in four layers:
1) It illuminates the ruler under the Dao,
who governs through non-action and emptiness;
2) It exposes the tyrant without the Dao,
whose agitation, competition, and greed are rampant;
3) It expands upon the deeper roots of agitation and competition,
where blame and discord grow ever heavier;
4) It demonstrates the beauty of contentment,
to encourage those who seek cultivation.

**1) Illuminating the Ruler Under the Dao: Non-Action and Emptiness**

The Dao is profound and mysterious,
its divine power not constrained by force—
the heavens and earth receive it and remain serene and silent,
the sages align with it and dwell in perfect ease.

The wind does not howl through the branches,
yet Emperor Yao was praised for his harmonious governance in *Yi Mu*,
the rain does not flood the fields,
yet Emperor Shun achieved great peace in *Tai Ping*.

Thus, when King Wu overthrew the Shang,
he returned to Hua Yang and tended his horses with leisure,
and when King Tang defeated Jie,
he wandered in the Peach Orchard, letting his cattle graze freely.

The Five Emperors and the Three Sovereigns
all aligned with the pure winds of virtue,
transforming the world beautifully—
this shows that even those who ride in triumph
must still return to cultivate the Dao.

Therefore, in the age of the Dao,
the warhorses are turned back to manure the fields;
in years without the Dao,
the armies of warhorses roam the wilds endlessly.

The Great Sage instructs us—
his words are not in vain.

When the world is under the Dao,
the warhorses are turned back to manure the fields.

**Imperial Note:**
The ruler who governs under the Dao
practices non-action and spontaneous transformation.
Since he does not indulge in greed,
there are no wars—
the warhorses are withdrawn,
and the people may till their fields in peace.

**Imperial Explanation:**
*However* (却) means to repel and remove.
*Manure* (粪) refers to cultivating the fields.
When the world is under the Dao,
it means the ruler governs by the Dao,
practicing non-action and transformation,
keeping the four borders at ease,
with no military conflicts—
he need not annex more lands,
lest he burden the common folk.
Thus, he repels the warhorses and weapons,
and the people may freely plow and till their fields.

**He Shang Gong says:**
When the world is under the Dao,
it means the ruler himself is under the Dao.
To turn back the warhorses for manuring the fields—
manuring here means fertilizing the fields.
For the ruler, it means withdrawing his vital *yang* essence
to nourish his own body.

**Li Rong says:**
When the ruler is under the Dao,
he dispenses with the swift warhorses,
and his subjects practice non-action,
manuring the fields for cultivation.
Those who seek the True Way
abandon their restless, worldly passions,
and manure their bodies with virtue and the Dao.
Scholars, cutting off their idle, wandering distractions,
manure their minds with study and letters.

**Chen Xuying’s Explanation:**
The ruler under the Dao
goes forth across the world,
with weapons laid to rest and martial arts abandoned,
the realm pacified and at ease—
governing through non-action,
he thus repels the warhorses
and lets the fields be manured.

For the cultivation of one’s body,
it means repelling the six senses—
the warhorses of the mind—
and manuring the heart with the Dao,
hence Mencius says:
*"All men till their fields with manure,
yet none know how to manure the heart with learning."*

**2) Exposing the Tyrant Without the Dao: Agitation, Competition, and Greed**

When the world lacks the Dao,
warhorses breed in the outskirts.

**Imperial Note:**
The ruler who lacks the Dao
indulges in desires and conquests,
so the armies of warhorses
proliferate in the borderlands.

**Imperial Explanation:**
*Outskirts* (郊) means *boundaries*—
the contested lands where defenses are held.
It speaks of a ruler who does not govern by the Dao,
whose realm is barren and unyielding,
so the warhorses and armies
take root in the borderlands,
never returning.

**He Shang Gong says:**
When the world lacks the Dao,
it means the ruler himself lacks the Dao.
Warhorses breed in the outskirts—
the wars never cease,
and the warhorses remain in the borderlands,
never returning.

**Yan Junping says:**
The people’s lives
hang upon the ruler’s decree,
and the ruler’s foundation
rests upon the people’s support.
When the ruler is under the Dao,
the ten thousand households flourish,
and the ancestral temples shine;
when the ruler lacks the Dao,
the ancestral temples crumble,
and the people perish—
this is the natural response.

**Li Rong says:**
*Breed* (生) means *to arise*.
Without governing by the Dao but instead indulging in martial pursuits,
he adorns himself with weapons and wields force,
fortifying the four borders,
raising the five armies—
thus the warhorses breed in the outskirts.

For the cultivation of one’s body,
it refers to the restless and competitive man,
whose heart does not harbor the Dao.
He lets the six senses—
the warhorses of the mind—
gallop freely through the dusty world,
entangled in endless gains and losses,
rights and wrongs.

**Chen Xuying’s Explanation:**
The *outskirts* (郊) are the lands beyond the capital.
When the tyrant rules the world without the Dao,
he plunders both people and lands,
disturbing the four quarters,
his greed for territory endless,
his love of war unceasing—
thus the warhorses and armies
proliferate in the outskirts.

For the cultivation of one’s body,
it speaks of the agitated and competitive man,
whose heart does not cherish the Dao.
He indulges the six senses—
the warhorses of the mind—
galloping through the dusty world,
never reflecting on the True Way,
always clinging to external things—
thus it is said that the warhorses breed in the outskirts.

When the world is under the Dao,
the warhorses are turned back to manure the fields;
when the world lacks the Dao,
the warhorses breed in the outskirts.

This refers to *noon* (午),
when the vital *yang* essence flourishes.
*Noon* is the hour of the horse,
so when the heart is bound,
it turns east;
when it desires west,
it turns west;
when it desires south,
it turns south;
when it desires north,
it turns north.

The heart has four gates,
knowing the four directions—
all it sees by day and night,
when asleep, becomes dreams.

When the heart harbors the Dao,
the righteous *qi* flows freely,
nourishing the limbs and moistening the body,
lengthening the hair and skin in mystic grace—
thus the warhorses are repelled,
and their essence is manured within.

When the heart lacks the Dao,
it generates lust and disorder,
and the warhorses gallop wildly in the outskirts,
corrupting the body’s meridians—
thus it is said that the warhorses breed in the outskirts.

**3) Expanding Upon the Heavy Blame of the Agitated and Competitive Heart**

No sin is greater than *desiring what is desirable*—

**Imperial Note:**
When the heart sees what it desires,
this is the greatest sin.

**Imperial Explanation:**
To break the law is sin,
and to covet is to incite.
The sin of warhorses breeding in the outskirts
comes from the ruler’s greed for land—
when he sees the land as desirable,
his desire stirs,
and he seeks to take it—
this is the greatest sin,
hence it is said:
*No sin is greater than desiring what is desirable.*

**4) The Master of the Riverbank Speaks: Lust is the Pursuit of Sensual Pleasures.**
**Honor Says:** No sin is greater than *desiring what is desirable*.

**5) The Master of the Riverbank Speaks:** Riches and honor cannot restrain themselves.
**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** *Caigu* (罪) is the root of suffering—
when one is driven by the realm of beauty before them,
it is the origin of transgression.
Thus, it is said:
*Do not see what is desirable,
so that the heart may not be disordered.*

**6) The Master of the Riverbank Speaks:** *Desiring what is desirable* refers to the initial stirrings of greed while not yet possessing it—
its guilt is lighter than that of *unknowing contentment*.
One who *unknows contentment*, having obtained yet still craving more,
brings upon themselves calamity heavier than guilt.
But for those who, having obtained,
still lack satisfaction—
their *caigu* (咎) is a fault graver than calamity itself.

**7) The Master of the Riverbank Speaks:** Such is the heart that covets others’ gains and treasures.

**8) Honor Says:** To cast aside *desiring what is desirable* is to seek nothing beyond,
and to purify the innate nature is to have no place to go within—
thus it is said that one *knows contentment*.
All actions align with the Dao,
and there are no matters that lack *contentment*—
no time of *not-enoughness*,
only *contentment*.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** Restraining oneself within proper bounds,
one practices *contentment*—
constantly without deficiency,
thus it is said that one is *constantly content*.

**9) The Master of the Riverbank Speaks:** *Contentment* is rooted in *knowing contentment*,
and *constant contentment* is the absence of desire.

**Honor Says:** *Contentment* is *knowing contentment*—
its virtue lies in the heart, not in things.
To follow proper limits and guard one’s nature,
though few in possession, is abundant in essence;
though many in possession, yet insatiable desire,
is truly lacking—
thus it is said:
*Contentment is rooted in knowing contentment*,
*constant contentment* is without desire.*

---

**Chapter 47: The Chapter of Not Stepping Beyond the Door**

This chapter follows the previous one,
for the previous one clarified the rectification of the Dao,
showing that one who *knows contentment* is virtuous,
while one who *unknows contentment* is without the Dao—
hence this chapter demonstrates
that the virtuous one reflects without relying on the heart,
while the one without the Dao relies on the heart
and cannot reflect.

Within this chapter alone,
three themes unfold:
First, the Sage’s empty mirror—
reflection without reliance on the heart;
Second, the common man’s reliance on the heart,
yet inability to reflect;
Third, the reiteration of the empty-reflecting one,
who moves yet remains serene.

**First: The Sage’s Empty Mirror, Reflection Without Relying on the Heart**

The Great Sage does not act,
the Perfect One has no heart.
He gives birth to the dual forms of purity and impurity—
what need has He of things?
He stirs the *qi* of mountains and rivers—
yet His divine power is unseen.

He surveys countless voices yet speaks not,
sits in empty reflection yet finds self-realization—
thus, without stepping beyond the door,
the world knows Him.
How could He compare to the King of Zhou’s welcoming of the Marquis of Fang,
or the empty feasts at the Jade Pool,
or the First Emperor’s viewing of the sun,
or the hollow boast of the whip’s might over the stones?

Though His footsteps may traverse the nine desolate regions,
and His reins tire the eight swift steeds,
His gaze widens beyond the door’s threshold,
and His senses grow ever more bewildered—
yet the Great Sage reveals Himself without stepping forth.

**Not stepping beyond the door, yet knowing the world.**
**Imperial Note:** Not stepping beyond the door yet knowing the world,
not gazing through the window yet seeing the Way of Heaven—
*wu gong* (无为) and passive governance,
issuing no commands beyond the door,
is to know the principles of ruling the world.
When human affairs are harmonious,
the celestial order follows naturally—
thus, without need for gazing through the window,
the Way of Heaven may be known.

**Imperial Explanation:** The virtuous Sage-ruler governs without action,
issuing no commands beyond the door,
while the pure winds naturally harmonize across the world.
This may truly be called knowing the principles of ruling the world.

Again it is explained: When the sage-ruler teaches well, the realm responds with virtue, and thus without troubling to step beyond the door, the world may be known. Hence the *Yijing* says:

*"The gentleman speaks forth his words—
if virtuous, they resonate a thousand li away.
How much more so for those nearby!"*
This is what is meant.

**River Above Master** says: The sage knows the world without stepping beyond the door by knowing others through himself, knowing others’ households through his own—thus perceiving the world.

**Rong** says: Observe with the Dao, and no principle remains unseen; illuminate with wisdom, and no matter remains unknown—this is called knowing without action.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: The "door" refers to perception and awareness—discriminations like grasping and distinguishing. The sage of the Way, with an empty heart and inner stillness, does not let the mind wander through worldly affairs, yet knows all things under heaven—this is true light illuminating the mundane.

**Not gazing through the window, yet seeing the Way of Heaven.**
**Imperial Commentary**: Heaven and humanity resonate in harmony; vital essences interflow. When the sage-ruler governs with virtue, the celestial patterns remain unerring, and the five phases are not violated by disorder in yin and yang. Thus the *Shujing* says:

*"When auspicious omens appear, the winds grow solemn;
timely rains fall like admonitions.
When calamities arise, the clouds gather;
constant winds blow—*
if such signs issue from oneself, and their forms manifest in Heaven, why wait to gaze through the window before knowing?"

The *Yijing* says:
*"Speech and action—
the means by which the gentleman moves Heaven and Earth."*

**River Above Master** says: The Way of Heaven and the Way of humanity are one; Heaven and humanity communicate, their vital essences interpenetrating. When the sage-ruler is pure and still, Heaven’s qi aligns; when he is filled with desires, Heaven’s qi grows chaotic. All fortune and misfortune, benefit and harm, arise from within.

**Rong** says: The two luminaries adorn the sky, the five stars gleam in the Han—why must one gaze through the window to see them? To claim "inner enlightenment" while gazing through the window is to force interpretations. The Way of Heaven is the natural principle; one need not use snares to catch fish or rabbits, nor labor with words to awaken to ultimate truth—this is seeing the Way of Heaven without gazing through the window.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: *Window-gazing* is peering with intent; *tao* (牖) are the root orifices. The Way of Heaven is the natural principle—when one sits in forgetfulness of the body, not peering through the orifices, the true heart shines within, revealing the natural Way. This is wisdom illuminating truth.

The door opens to passage; it is like true light illuminating the mundane. The window’s inner clarity reflects returning to the true source.

**Secondly, it clarifies that ordinary people, through the mind, cannot illuminate.**
The farther they go, the less they know.

**Imperial Note**: If one cannot practice *wu wei*, even if commands extend far, one’s grasp of governing principles grows ever slighter.

**Imperial Commentary**: This explains the ruler who has lost the Way—unable to abide in *wu wei* and humility, he seeks to issue edicts to transform people. The farther his commands reach, the more he strays from *wu wei*, and the fewer his insights into governance.

**River Above Master** says: It is like leaving one’s own home to observe others’ households, leaving one’s own body to observe others’ bodies—the farther one looks, the less one knows.

**Rong** says: Though one traverses the cosmos, one may not recognize mountains and rivers; though one reads all the classics, one may not grasp ultimate truth—this is called ignorance.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: The inverted man cannot illuminate principle; his mind chases after phenomena, ever farther without satisfaction, his knowledge shallow and dim, his discernment lacking.

**Thirdly, it emphasizes those who embody the union of emptiness, stillness, and illumination—still yet able to act.**
Thus the sage knows without action.

**Imperial Note**: Not stepping beyond the door—hence "without action"—pure and unadorned, yet knowing the Way of governance.

**Imperial Commentary**: This further elucidates knowing the world without stepping beyond the door. With no affairs, no action, no commands issued, it is said he does not act. Taking the near from himself, he knows distant things—thus, without my action, people transform of themselves. Why wait for words to issue beyond the door before calling it knowing?

**River Above Master** says: The sage does not ascend to Heaven nor descend into the abyss, yet knows Heaven and Earth—by knowing them with the heart.

**Rong** says: Solitary enlightenment.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: *Without action* means the mind does not grasp past phenomena, while *knowing* is the ability to perceive truth. The law must ultimately be empty and still—like a mirror hung in a high hall, objects pass before it and are reflected, yet the reflection is without intent. Thus *Zhuangzi* says: *"The sage does not use the mind to illuminate; he illuminates without the mind."* This completes the explanation of knowing the world without stepping beyond the door.

**Not seeing yet naming,**
**Imperial Note**: Not gazing through the window—hence "not seeing." When humanity is harmonious and Heaven obeys, one may name the great peace.

**Imperial Commentary**: This further elucidates seeing the Way of Heaven without gazing through the window. When the crane cries, its young respond; actions move Heaven—from the small, one may know the great; examining oneself, one may know things. Auspicious omens are summoned by the person himself; thus the transformation of great peace may be attained and spoken of—why wait to gaze before naming?

The *Shujing* says:
*"When the ruler above loves the Dao, the people below love virtue;
when he loves martial prowess, the people below love strength."*
The sage infers the great from the small, the external from the internal.

**Rong** says: Mystic vision.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary**: *Not seeing* means penetrating all phenomena as empty and illusory, with nothing visible. *Naming* means rectifying the names of all things, promulgating manifest teachings. Not seeing yet naming, not responding yet responding—naming without seeing, responding without responding.

This completes the explanation of seeing the Way of Heaven without gazing through the window.

**Not acting yet achieving.**
**Imperial Note**: Without issuing commands, yet the world is transformed.

**Imperial Commentary**: This summarizes the meaning of not stepping beyond and not gazing through the window. If the ruler above has any action, the people below will be disturbed. Now the sage concentrates his spirit, serene and dignified, silently in the hall—ruler without action, people without affairs, the populace prosperous, all transformations accomplished of themselves.

**River Master (He Shang Gong) said:** When the ruler above does no acting, the people below have no affairs, the populace is well-provided and self-sufficient, and all things transform and fulfill themselves naturally.

**Rong said:** This is the fulfillment of naturalness.

**Cheng Commentary:** *Not acting* means concentrating the spirit in stillness and tranquility, surpassing all doing in its subtlety. *Achieving* means transforming all beings and perfecting those who seek the Way—this reveals stillness in motion.

**Chapter 48: The Daily Increase of Learning**
*Why this chapter follows:* The previous chapter clarified the distinction between the common and the sage’s mind through their differing illumination. Thus, this chapter follows to distinguish the two paths—Daoist and secular—with their differing gains and losses.

This chapter’s meaning is divided into three parts:
1. The distinction between Daoist and secular learning, with their differing gains and losses.
2. The progression through illusory stages to attain the Mysterious Extremes.
3. The difference between having affairs and having no affairs, and their respective gains and losses.

---
**1. The Distinction Between Daoist and Secular Learning, with Their Differing Gains and Losses**

The Dao of the Primordial Void is profound, its essence subtle and its gate difficult to enter. Its meaning is vast, its essence refined—it precedes the Imperial Symbol, surpasses the Great Netherworld Sage. The Celestial Script shines, revealing the eight-cornered brilliance, the Jade Palace conceals the *Bo* [primordial vessel], encompassing the single vehicle’s banner. How could this compare to secular learning, which daily grows ever more extravagant and superficial?

Zhang Zhi’s inkwell remains confined within the cage of the *fanglong* [boundary], Yang Xiong’s study is forever entangled in the ferry of life and death. Unable to daily diminish doing, they instead intensify the very walls they face.

**Learning daily increases; the Dao daily diminishes.**

**Imperial Note:** Those who learn daily increase their knowledge and perception. Those who cultivate the Dao daily diminish their deeds and practices. Increasing knowledge is the gradual path of study; diminishing deeds is the gateway to enlightenment. Thus, through increasing, one accumulates merit; through forgetting merit, one attains the Dao itself.

**Imperial Commentary:** *For* means cultivation; *diminish* means forgetting and letting go. Those who first seek learning do so to attain knowledge, refining their deeds to correct their faults. Ultimately, they awaken to principle, forgetting speech and letting go of deeds. Hence the Note says: Increasing knowledge is the gradual path of study—speaking of its beginning. Diminishing deeds is the gateway to enlightenment—speaking of its end.

**River Master said:** *Learning daily increases* refers to the studies of governance, teaching, ritual, and music, which daily grow more elaborate in emotion, desire, and ornamentation. *The Dao daily diminishes* refers to the natural Way, where emotion, desire, and ornamentation are daily eroded away.

**Yan said:** This is the abandonment of knowledge. The knowing that comes from non-knowing is the origin of knowing. The teaching that is not taught is the essence of teaching. It is the foundation of divine clarity, the teacher of Heaven and Earth.

**Rong said:** *Learning daily increases*—expanding with scrolls, lengthening with perception, sharpening with fame, and multiplying with cravings. *The Dao daily diminishes*—practicing the teaching of non-action, dual forgetting of form and principle, embodying the void and the mysterious, abandoning self and other alike. When one attains non-doing, all doing is lost; when one has no affairs, all affairs are diminished. How much less so the proud, the swollen, the extravagant, and the indulgent!

**Cheng Commentary:** *Learning daily increases*—*for* means cultivation; *learning* means secular learning. Those who cultivate worldly learning sharpen their discriminations, thus their desires daily multiply. *The Dao daily diminishes*—*for the Dao* means cultivating the Way. Those who cultivate the Way attain emptiness and tranquility, so their wisdom and virtue gradually clarify, and their entanglements daily diminish.

---
**2. The Progression Through Illusory Stages to Attain the Mysterious Extremes**

Diminish again, and again diminish, until reaching non-doing.

**Imperial Note:** Diminish again, and again diminish, until reaching non-doing. Non-doing yet nothing is left undone. Those who learn accumulate deeds; those who cultivate the Dao forget diminishing. Though they diminish deeds, they still retain the intention to diminish. When even this intention is forgotten, they attain the tranquil state of non-doing. Like a mirror reflecting all things without obstruction, thus nothing is left undone.

**Imperial Commentary:** *Diminish* refers to diminishing the deeds of those who cultivate the Dao. *Again diminish* refers to eliminating the very intention to forget deeds. Thus, the first diminishing forgets traces, the second diminishing forgets the mind. When both mind and traces are forgotten, one attains the ultimate. Attaining the ultimate is reaching non-doing.

**River Master said:** Diminish again, and again diminish—this diminishes emotions and desires. Again diminishing is the gradual means of removing them. Until reaching non-doing, one should remain serene as an infant, doing nothing at all.

**Rong said:** Merging existence into non-existence is diminishing. Existence departs, non-existence is not forgotten—this is diminishing again. The principle is dark, the truth is still—this is non-doing.

**Cheng Commentary:** Those who learn cling to desires; those who cultivate the Dao cling to non-doing. Though their depths differ, both are equally stagnant. Now, to rectify these two fixations, there is the text of *diminishing again*. First, diminishing diminishes existence; then, diminishing diminishes non-existence. Both extremes are abandoned, reaching the non-doing within unity.

**Non-doing yet nothing is left undone.**

**Imperial Note:** When virtue and the Dao merge, there is nothing they do not accomplish, nothing they do not do.

**Imperial Commentary:** Doing entails obstruction; obstruction entails limitations. Now, since there is non-doing, non-doing entails no obstruction, thus nothing is left undone. This is the harmony with the Dao, responding universally and comprehensively. Hence, the earlier volume states: *The Dao is ever non-doing, yet nothing is left undone.*

**Rong said:** To remove burdensome existence, one must return to non-doing. Yet those deluded, hearing of non-doing, sit idle with folded hands, taking cold ashes for the Great Way and a clod of earth for the utmost mind.

---

**Fearful that one might rigidly cling to non-doing, unable to transcend and dissolve [its limitations], it is said: "Non-doing yet nothing is left undone."**

**Non-doing yet nothing is left undone is not true non-doing; having action yet returning to non-doing is not true action.**
This is the essence of both learning the Dao and embodying the Dao—both share the same aspiration. Only when motion and stillness both cease does harmony prevail.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** When stillness reaches its depth, motion arises as its manifestation; thus, nothing is left undone. The earlier volume states: *The Dao is ever non-doing yet nothing is left undone.*

**Thirdly, it clarifies the distinction between having affairs and having none—gain and loss differ.**
**To govern the world, one must always act without interference.**

**Imperial Note:** Non-doing and non-affairs mean the world naturally submits; thus, one may govern the world.

**○ Imperial Commentary:** This exhorts the sovereign to practice non-doing. "To govern" means to harmonize and transform. To transform the world, one must act without interference and without affairs—without affairs, the people are undisturbed; without interference, the people find ease. With such governance, what cannot be achieved? The "always" refers to never separating from non-affairs in guiding the people.

**○ Master He Shang Gong said:** "To govern" means to rule. One must always govern the world without interference, not with labor and agitation.

**○ Rong said:** To govern the world, one must always act without interference. But when affairs arise, it is insufficient to govern the world. "To govern" means to harmonize—when forgotten, there is neither attachment nor abandonment; when applied, there is both suitability and unsuitability. If one governs the world through non-doing, there is nothing that cannot be harmonized. If one governs the world through affairs, there is nothing that can be harmonized.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** "To govern" means to harmonize and transform. It speaks of harmonizing and governing all under heaven, guiding them toward goodness through non-affairs and non-doing. Though responding to things with action, the heart remains untroubled—this is motion within stillness. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *Who is so exhausted that they make things into affairs?* When affairs arise, it is insufficient to govern the world.

**Imperial Note:** Affairs bring agitation; agitation brings exhaustion—thus, it is insufficient to govern the world.

**○ Imperial Commentary:** Affairs refer to oppressive decrees and dense legal nets—harsh orders disturb the people, while strict laws multiply punishments. The people grow restless, and the four quarters scatter. If one seeks to harmonize and transform, how could it not be difficult? Thus, when affairs arise, it is insufficient to govern the world.

**○ Master He Shang Gong said:** When one favors affairs, governance becomes burdensome, and the people are unsettled—thus, it is insufficient to rule the world. "To govern" means to rule.

**○ Rong’s Commentary:** "To govern" means to harmonize—when forgotten, there is neither attachment nor abandonment; when applied, there is both suitability and unsuitability. If one governs the world through non-doing, there is nothing that cannot be harmonized. If one governs the world through affairs, there is nothing that can be harmonized.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** When the heart is not yet empty and forgotten, treating affairs as affairs while being entangled in them—then affairs differ from non-affairs, non-affairs differ from affairs, motion diverges from stillness, and stillness contradicts motion. Such a person is unfit to harmonize and transform the world.

**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage Has No Fixed Heart**

This chapter follows the previous one because the prior text elucidates *immediate affairs as non-affairs*—though responding without attachment, it is thus followed by this chapter, revealing how the Sage, without a fixed heart, can still respond to stimuli.

Within this chapter, the text unfolds in three layers:
1. It clarifies that the Sage has no fixed heart, responding as stimuli arise.
2. It shows the Sage’s benevolent salvation of the people, without abandonment.
3. It reveals how beings are entangled in delusion, prompting the Sage’s compassion and pity.

**First, it clarifies that the Sage has no fixed heart, responding as stimuli arise.**

The Great Sovereign rides the times, facing all directions to teach, while the True Lord governs the people, holding the celestial axis to bring peace. Their bellies full, all sing in harmony—without relying on imperial might. Unbuttoned, they savor themselves—how could they know the profound workings of heaven and earth? Ten thousand things move in unison, witnessing the overflowing transformation of the Zhou. The Eight Trigrams attend to affairs, measuring the pure winds of the age of Yao. Thus it is said: *The Sage has no fixed heart*, yet limbs and strength are fully exerted. Though chaos reigns, the seasons do not falter; though time shifts, the mysterious power sustains all. Opening a red heart to the world, the Sage seeks to transform people—aligning with the people’s hearts, how could it not be vast and boundless?

**The Sage has no fixed heart; the Sage takes the people’s hearts as their own.**

**Imperial Note:** The Sage’s heart responds to stimuli as they arise; responses arise from stimuli, hence no fixed heart. Though the heart is unfixed, it is always directed toward transforming goodness in the people.

**○ Imperial Commentary:** The Sage is empty and forgotten; stimuli arise, and responses follow. Responses must follow stimuli, and since stimuli vary, the heart has no fixed nature. Though unfixed, the intent is to save with compassion—for the people have untrustworthy and unvirtuous hearts, so the Sage blends their own heart with theirs to guide and transform them. Hence, it is said: *The Sage has no fixed heart.*

**○ Master He Shang Gong said:** The Sage has no fixed heart—the Sage values adaptability and follows suit. They conform to what benefits the people.

**○ Yan said:** The heart of no-heart is the master of the heart. For a single body, without the heart, danger becomes safety; with the heart, safety becomes peril. If the Sage above contains the transformation of virtue and power, and below encompasses the hearts of ten thousand people—whether things are great or small, they view the heart as their own body. Abandoning personal desires, they take what brings ease to others, achieving great harmony.

**○ Rong said:** The ruler above has no attachment to action, trusting the people’s self-transformation. The Sage has no emotions to distinguish, responding to all things with resonance.

**○ Master Cheng’s Commentary:** The body of the Dao is concentrated and refined, the mind empty and free from thought—its stillness matches the boundless void. Thus, it has no heart.

The common folk are the myriad beings.

Yet, the Sage has no heart, but responds when touched—response follows the touch of things, hence taking the hearts of the myriad beings as their own. Though without a heart in response, they also do not reject what is not touched.

**Second:** It shows how the Sage benefits all beings without abandonment.
Those who are virtuous, I reward with virtue.
**Yu’s Annotation:** Those who are virtuous, I reward with virtue; those who are not, I also reward with virtue—virtue as power.
Those who are faithful, I reward with faith; those who are not, I also reward with faith—virtue as faith.
For those who desire virtue and faith, I thus reward them with virtue and faith.
As for the unfaithful, I also teach them with virtue and faith, so that the myriad beings may be moved by the Sage’s power of virtue and faith.

**Yu’s Commentary:** This is the meaning of response and resonance.
*I* refers to the Sage.
Virtuous means those who cultivate the Way with no desires—
**Yu’s Commentary:** The Sage encourages their progress and fulfills their actions, leading them to the utmost virtue of *I reward with virtue*.
**He Shang Gong said:** The myriad beings act virtuously, and the Sage rewards them accordingly.

**Rong said:** Those who are virtuous, I reward with virtue; those who are not, I also reward with virtue—virtue attained.
If there were a heart to distinguish, there would be virtue and non-virtue, faith and non-faith—
one could not claim virtue attained.
Now, since there is no heart to distinguish,
not only does virtue reward virtue,
but virtue also rewards non-virtue—
virtue rewarding all is thus called virtue attained.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** Those who are virtuous, I reward with virtue; those who are not, I also reward with virtue—virtue attained.
The virtuous are those who cultivate the Way without desires;
the non-virtuous are those ensnared in the realm of action.
The Sage universally teaches with equal virtue and power,
leading them to attain virtue—
this is the meaning of taking the myriad beings’ hearts as one’s own.
Those who are not virtuous, I also reward with virtue—virtue as power.

**Yu’s Annotation:** The non-virtuous are those steeped in habit and delusion,
faithful to error and opposing the Way—
yet the Sage also draws them toward virtue with the Way’s power.
Virtue as power means transforming them into the Sage’s virtue.

**He Shang Gong said:** Though the myriad beings may have the non-virtuous,
the Sage transforms them to become virtuous.

Those who are faithful, I reward with faith.
**Yu’s Commentary:** Faithful means hearing the Dao and diligently practicing it,
the heart free from fixation—
the Sage responds with utmost sincerity,
praising their virtue and leading them to profound faith.

**He Shang Gong said:** The myriad beings are faithful,
and the Sage rewards them accordingly.

**Rong said:** Those who are faithful, I reward with faith;
those who are not, I also reward with faith—faith attained.
Faith is compliance—
since things’ emotions may be compliant or not,
and actions may be in accord or not,
one cannot claim all are compliant.
Now, the Sage has neither compliance nor non-compliance,
all are compliant—
without compliance or non-compliance,
all are in accord—
thus it is called the great compliance.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** Those who are faithful, I reward with faith;
those who are not, I also reward with faith—virtue as faith.
Faithful means hearing the sutras with love and delight;
unfaithful means not delighting in the Dao or hearing it.
The Sage acts with emptiness, compassion, and equal salvation,
not distinguishing between the faithful and the unfaithful,
but universally inspiring faith in all.
Thus, the Purple Cloud Lady said: Faith is the key to gain and loss.
Again, the scripture says: Faith is the pivot for learning the Dao.

**Question:** The Sage has no heart, yet responds when touched—
they do not respond when not touched,
and do not touch when not responded to—
why then do they teach the faithful but not the unfaithful,
yet now teach both the faithful and unfaithful alike?
Why also do they respond and resonate to both what is touched and what is not?

**Answer:** Response may be universal or particular—
like treating the Dao in the Mysterious Capital of Jade,
yet always saving the Three Realms—
this is universal response to those who are virtuous and faithful.
As for the barbarians, when touched by the Purple Qi’s Western Drift,
they receive the Dao’s teachings from Master Yin—
this is particular response.
If particular response, then it awaits particular touch;
universal response is the ordinary compassionate illumination—
thus the upper volume says: *Constantly benefiting all beings without abandoning any.*

**Third:** It shows how beings are ensnared in delusion,
and the Sage arises with compassion and faith.
Those who are not faithful, I also reward with faith—virtue as faith.

**Yu’s Commentary:** The unfaithful are those stubborn and rebellious against the teachings—
yet the Sage transforms them with equal and proper faith,
leading them to abandon doubt and return to faith—
thus it is called virtue as faith.

**He Shang Gong said:** The myriad beings are unfaithful,
and the Sage transforms them to become faithful.

The Sage is in the world,
mixing the hearts of all beings with concern.
**Yu’s Annotation:** The Sage governs the world with the Way,
transforming and guiding the myriad beings—
constantly mixing their hearts with concern,
leading them to virtue and faith,
while the Sage’s heart remains concentrated and still,
its power illuminating with perfect clarity—
mixing their hearts with concern,
all for the world—
thus it is said: *mixing the hearts of all beings.*

**Yu’s Commentary:** This shows how the Sage blends with the myriad beings in their use of heart.
Mixing with concern means the Sage fears the myriad beings may not return to virtue and faith,
thus mixing their hearts with concern.
Yet the Sage has no heart—
what then is there to fear or rejoice?
What is spoken of as mixing with concern
is because the myriad beings in the world have not yet attained virtue and faith—
thus the Sage blends with things,
using their hearts—
hence it is said: *the Sage mixes the hearts of all beings.*

**He Shang Gong said:** The Sage is in the world,
ever vigilant with constant awe,
never daring to be arrogant in wealth or honor.

Mixing the hearts of all beings means
the Sage muddles the hearts of the myriad beings,
as if they were dull and unenlightened.

**Yan said:** Mixing with concern,
like vastness—
speaking of an empty heart embracing all directions.

**Rong said:** Mixing with concern means not dwelling.
All emotional distinctions—
seeing virtue or non-virtue,
faith or non-faith—
the Sage does not dwell,
but drifts along with each circumstance,
mixing their hearts of distinction,
equalizing their intentions of right and wrong.

「○ **Chéng Shū** said: *Yīn-yīn* is the appearance of constant dread—speaking of the Sage who acts without clinging to responses, yet in the world, he spreads vast compassion, rescuing the common folk, fearing they may perish. Thus, he trembles with earnest vigilance.

To *mix the hearts of all beings* means *hún-hún-dùn-dùn*—without distinction. It speaks of how ordinary folk, bewildered by emotions and ensnared by phenomena, recklessly grasp or reject. The Sage seeks to muddle their hearts, erasing distinctions, and this very earnest dread is what is meant.

The common folk all *pour their ears and eyes*—
**Yù Zhù:** The common folk, transformed by the Sage’s virtue, pour their ears and eyes to observe and listen to the Sage.

**Yù Shū:** The common folk, moved by the Sage’s virtue to embrace goodness, look upward to his pure transformation and follow his example, thus all pour their ears and eyes to observe and listen, taking the Sage as their model.

**Hé Shàng Gōng** said: *Pour* means *to use*. The common folk all use their ears and eyes as the Sage’s own vision and hearing.

**Róng** said: The common folk cannot restrain their emotions with their nature, but instead indulge their hearts in desires, pouring their ears and eyes into sounds and colors, fixating their noses and mouths on fragrances and flavors. Thus, they fall into confusion and blindness. The Sage follows their afflictions to prescribe teachings, adapts to their circumstances to guide them, and transforms them through his own nature. He says, *“I alone remain like an infant or newborn, unaware of how sounds and colors delight the ears and eyes.”*

**Chéng Shū** said: *Addiction* means entanglement and stagnation. Those lost in delusion drown in the world’s illusions, indulging their ears and eyes in colors and sounds. Drifting aimlessly, they wander without hope of return. The Sage pities their deep confusion and thus reveals their afflicted state. Among the six senses, he highlights two to emphasize how these two are the deepest roots of attachment. Hence, the *Xī Shēng Jīng* says: *“Ears and eyes, colors and sounds—oh, how you linger!”* By mentioning these two, all senses are implied, though the text is concise.

The Sage treats them all as infants.

**Yù Zhù:** The Sage pities the common folk as a mother pities her children, thus viewing them all like infants.

**Yù Shū:** Since the common folk pour their ears and eyes to observe the Sage, the Sage regards them as a mother regards her children, hence *“treats them all as infants.”* Another interpretation: The common folk possess discriminating hearts, but the Sage transforms them to goodness, making them like infants—without distinction.

**Hé Shàng Gōng** said: The Sage loves and cares for the common folk like worms or infants, nurturing and raising them without expecting repayment.

**Chéng Shū** said: All beings indulge recklessly in their ears and eyes, sinking into the river of desire. The Sage, with earnest dread and compassion, rescues them—his duty akin to that of a mother to her child. He pities their ignorance as one pities a helpless infant.

Beginning of Volume XIV, with Tang Xuānzōng’s Imperial Commentary and Explanations, along with annotations by Hé Shàng Gōng, Yán Jūn Píng, Lǐ Róng, Xī Huá Fashi’s Chéng Xuānyīng Commentary, and Mángyáng Qiáng Sīqí’s Compilation.)*

**Chapter 50: The Dao of Birth and Death**

**First**, distinguishing the common and the sage, showing how mistaken attachments differ.

**Second**, posing hypothetical questions and answers to clarify their origins.

**Third**, revealing the sage’s benevolent embrace of those bound by life and death, untouched by the Three Poisons.

**Fourth**, raising further doubts to praise and conclude.

**First**, distinguishing the common and the sage, showing how mistaken attachments differ.
The **Dao** of the **Way**’s supreme eminence, nameless yet honored,
The **Dao** of profound **virtue**, deep and boundless,
Resting in the **Way**’s loftiest realm, moving with ease in the **Great Ultimate**’s palace,
Rising above servile compliance, transcending the cycles of birth and death.

On the **Lan**’s mountain heights, the **Zuo**’s **Pavilion** of gleaming white jade,
Before the **Han**’s **Pass**, the **Tao**’s **Gate** where purple clouds linger—
The common folk, bound by love and desire, their minds in endless slumber,
Pursue the **Thirteen Affairs** of life and death, their passions lost in delusion,
Yet they cling to existence, seeking to prolong their hundred years.

Life flees like an arrow shot into the **Exhausted Spring**,
The soul drifts in the **Intermediate Prison**,
Once buried in the grave, only the wind through the pines is heard,
Once the body is interred, the moon in the courtyard is unseen—
The **Great Sage** weeps, his heart aching for their folly.
**Birth and Death** are intertwined.

**Imperial Commentary**: Enlightenment brings **birth**; delusion leads to **death**. This is the chapter’s essence.
**Imperial Explanation**: To understand **birth and death** is to transcend life’s clinging, thus **birth**.
To be ensnared by life and death is to be moved by death’s grasp, thus **death**. This is the chapter’s gateway.

**Hé Shàng Gōng** said: **"Birth"** means desires arise from the Five **Viscera**, the soul steadies and the **spirit** rests—thus **birth**.
**"Death"** means desires sink into the chest and mind, the **spirit** falters and is confused—thus **death**.

**Lǐ Róng** said: From obscurity to clarity is called **birth**; from existence to nonexistence is called **death**.

**Chéng Xuānyīng’s Commentary**: **"Birth"** is to transcend the Three Realms, to escape life and death.
**"Death"** is to sink into the Three **Abysses**, to be drowned in birth and death.
If one comprehends the **Dao** of life and death,
They release **birth** by emerging from the **Ultimate Void**,
And release **death** by returning existence to the **Ultimate Void**—
This is the **Dao** of **death**.

**Thirteen types of life**,
**Imperial Commentary**: Of the thirteen types of life, thirteen types of death—
A broad discussion of all beings, those who live in harmony with life’s **Dao**,
And those who die in accordance with death’s **Dao**. Thus, in general terms,
Three out of ten follow the **Dao** of life or death.

**Imperial Explanation**: "Types" means **categories**.
This broadly discusses beings who can live in harmony with life’s **Dao**,
Not clinging to their own existence, acting naturally in time,
Free from all attachments—such beings, in general terms, number three out of ten.
This means few follow the **Dao**, while many oppose it.

**Hé Shàng Gōng** said: The thirteen types of life and death—
The **Dao** of the Nine **Oifices** and Four **Passes**, thirteen in total.
To live is to see without lust, hear without greed,
Smell without craving, taste without indulgence,
Hold without grasping, move without haste,
And expend **essence** without waste—
To die is the opposite.

**Yán Jūn Píng** said: **Emptiness**, **Non-being**, **Purity**, **Clarity**, **Subtlety**, **Moderation**, **Softness**, **Weakness**, **Lowliness**, **Humility**, **Timeliness**, **Harmony**, **Frugality**—
These are the **Thirteen Affairs**. **Emptiness** begets fullness,
**Non-being** begets constant existence,
**Purity** begets clarity,
**Stillness** begets inner illumination,
**Subtlety** begets prominence,
**Moderation** begets abundance,
**Softness** begets strength,
**Weakness** begets endurance,
**Lowliness** begets height,
**Humility** begets completeness,
**Timeliness** begets flow,
**Harmony** begets balance,
**Frugality** begets tranquility—
To apply these to nurturing the body brings longevity,
To apply them to governing the state extends the nation’s fate.

**Lǐ Róng** said: The thirteen types of **death**—
The **Dao** of the Nine **Oifices** and Four **Passes**, thirteen in total.
If one can sever desire, they belong to the **Dao** of life.
If they indulge recklessly, they belong to the **Dao** of **death**.

**Chéng Xuānyīng’s Commentary**: The thirteen types of life and death—
"Types" means **categories**. The thirteen refer to the Four **Passes** and Nine **Oifices**.
All beings possess these, yet the sage does not cling to the body as body,
Nor does he dwell on deluded attachments—
Thus he escapes the Three Realms.
The common folk, ensnared by deluded distinctions,
Their minds ever rising and falling,
Are thus overturned in their folly,
And sink into the Six **Paths**.

To sink into the Six **Paths** is the **Dao** of **death**;
To escape the Three Realms is the **Dao** of life.

**Thirteen types of death**,
**Imperial Explanation**: This also broadly discusses the **Dao** of peaceful death,
Not resisting change, departing naturally—this is harmony.
Free from fear and agitation—such beings also number three out of ten.

**Yán Jūn Píng** said: **Filledness**, **Existence**, **Turbulence**, **Disturbance**, **Prominence**, **Abundance**, **Rigidity**, **Strength**, **Height**, **Excess**, **Extravagance**, **Waste**, **Decay**—
These are the thirteen affairs.
**Filledness** begets **emptiness**,
**Existence** begets annihilation,
**Turbulence** dulls hearing,
**Disturbance** blinds perception,
**Prominence** fades into obscurity,
**Abundance** leads to scarcity,
**Rigidity** yields to softness,
**Strength** weakens into frailty,
**Height** descends to lowliness,
**Excess** empties into loss,
**Extravagance** brings constraint,
**Waste** invites ruin—
These are inauspicious; they belong to the **Dao** of **death**.

**Thirteen ways to court death**,
**Imperial Commentary**: To cling excessively to life harms its **Dao**;
To cherish this life too deeply, one is moved toward death’s grasp—
Once life’s **Dao** is lost, death’s **Dao** is also forsaken.
Such beings also number three out of ten.

**Imperial Explanation**: This explains those ensnared by delusion,
Who lose the **Dao** of life and death.
It says that though people wish to cultivate life,
They cannot comprehend it—
They are moved toward the perilous grounds of death,
For the **Dao** of life is abandoned,
And the **Dao** of death is also rejected—
Such beings also number three out of ten.

「○ Master Héshànggōng said: When people seek life with excessive fervor, their actions invite death—thirteen paths lead to death’s **Dao**.

○ Róng said: The reason one falls into death’s **Dao** is due to the thirteenfold accumulation of transgressions.

○ Chéng’s annotation: In general, when people are drawn to death’s **Dao** at every turn, it is because they cling to these thirteen delusions, entangled by past karmic influences.

**Second hypothetical question-and-answer**, clarifying its cause.
Why is this so?
○ **Imperial Commentary**: Why is this so? It is because of their excessive attachment to life. The question is: Why do they fall into death’s **Dao**? It is because of their excessive attachment to this life.
○ **Imperial Annotation**: This poses the question of why sentient beings fall into death’s **Dao**.

○ Master Héshànggōng said: Why do they fall into death’s **Dao**?

○ Róng said: Why is this so? It is because of their excessive attachment to life. How do they reach death’s **Dao**? They exhaust the **Dao** of their nine orifices (*jiǎo*), strain the **Dao** of their four limbs (*guān*), indulge in deeds that invite death (*sìyè*), and cherish a body that is impermanent (*wúcháng*). When their indulgence exceeds measure, they fall into death’s **Dao**.

○ Chéng’s annotation: This is a hypothetical question answered in terms of life’s **Dao**. It is because of their excessive attachment to life.
○ **Imperial Annotation**: This is the direct answer, stating that sentient beings fall into death’s **Dao** because they are immersed in worldly deeds (*yǒuwéi*), drowned in emotional desires, and indulge excessively in self-nurturing to sustain this life. Their attachment to life is too deep, hence they fall into death’s **Dao**.

○ Master Héshànggōng said: The reason they fall into death’s **Dao** is that their pursuit of life’s affairs is too excessive, defying the **Dao** and harming Heaven (*lián tiān*), acting recklessly and losing proper conduct (*shī jì*).

○ Chéng’s annotation: It means they cannot embody the **Dao** and forget life, yet cling to life as something real (*shēng wéi yǒu*), amassing wealth and resources to sustain this life, and overindulging in its pursuit—thus they fall into death’s **Dao**. This sentence answers the previous question.

**Third exposition on the virtuous cultivation of life**, where one is not harmed by the **Three Poisons** (*sāndú*).
Indeed, those who cultivate life with virtue,
○ **Imperial Commentary**: Those who cultivate life with virtue—when walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers. The rhinoceros has no place to strike its horn, the tiger no place to set its claws, and the soldiers no place to wield their blades. Those who cultivate life with virtue have no intent to harm others, so when walking on land, they do not seek out rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers. Thus, tigers, rhinoceros, and soldiers also have no intent to harm them.

○ **Imperial Annotation**: *Shè* means to guard. It refers to those who virtuously guard life with the **Dao**, perceiving its origin with profound insight. Originally pure and serene, they forget life itself in life, not letting emotional desires disrupt their harmony. They nourish their nature with emptiness and fluidity, and nothing can harm them—thus they are called virtuous guardians.

○ Master Héshànggōng said: *Shè* means to nurture.

○ Róng said: Indeed, those who cultivate life with virtue—when walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers. Those who do not nurture their nature are internally harmed by emotional desires and externally harmed by venomous creatures. The virtuous cultivator of life does not indulge, their nature is unharmed, their heart is free from poison, and nothing can harm them.

○ Chéng’s annotation: *Guāi* is an incomplete phrase; *wén* means to hear or perceive subtly. *Shè* means to guard and also to nurture. It speaks of those who virtuously guard and nurture life, embodying forgetfulness, emptiness, and tranquility, not lightly entangled by worldly influences. Their guarding and nurturing are revealed in what follows.

When walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers.
○ **Imperial Annotation**: The rhinoceros emerges from the Xiāng River to the south, is blackish-green in color. According to *Éryǎ*, it resembles a wild ox with a single horn weighing a thousand *jīn* (≈120 lbs). The virtuous cultivator of life does not stir harmful intent toward others, so when walking on land, they do not seek out rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battlefields, they are not struck by armored soldiers. Thus, rhinoceros, tigers, and soldiers also have no harmful intent toward them.

○ Master Héshànggōng said: When walking on land, they naturally avoid rhinoceros and tigers, and harm does not approach them. When entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers, for they do not delight in killing others.

○ Chéng’s annotation: When walking on land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers. *Lù* means flat ground. The rhinoceros is a venomous beast with one horn, resembling an ox, green in color. It states that the virtuous cultivators of life are not touched by venomous beasts. Internally, it means they reside peacefully, untouched by afflictions. When entering battle, they are not harmed by weapons. Internally, it means even amid worldly entanglements, they are not harmed by sensual passions.

The rhinoceros has no place to strike its horn, the tiger no place to set its claws, and the soldiers no place to wield their blades.
○ **Imperial Annotation**: Earlier, it was explained that the virtuous cultivators of life have no harmful intent within, so externally they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers. Here, it is shown that even if they meet such beasts or soldiers, the latter have no place to strike or harm. Thus, one knows that those who forget emotional attachments toward others can tame and befriend seagulls of the sea, domesticate and ride beasts of the land—how much more so would they avoid harm! Hence, there is no such harm.

○ Master Héshànggōng said: Those who nurture life, tigers and rhinoceros have no means to harm them, and blades have no way to strike.

○ Róng said: It means nurturing life with the **Dao**, accumulating virtue through action. Earlier, it was shown that they do not meet evil; now it is shown that even if they meet it, they suffer no harm.

○ Chéng’s annotation: *Zhù* means to stand; *cuò* means to set. The rhinoceros, upon encountering something, will charge with its horn—symbolizing ignorance (*chī*). The tiger is fierce and violent by nature—symbolizing anger (*zé*). Weapons are sharp and can harm others—symbolizing greed (*tān*). It states that those who cultivate life virtuously embody profound insight into true emptiness, so even amid the world, they are not harmed by the **Three Poisons**.

**Fourth repetition of the question**, praising the virtues of those who cultivate life with mastery.»

「Why then? **The Great Master’s annotation**: Why then? Because there is no place of death for them. Why then? Do rhinoceros, tiger, weapons, and armor have no room to strike? It is because they follow nature without selfishness, not treating death as death, so that things cannot harm their life—hence it is said there is no place of death for them.

**The Great Master’s commentary**: This question inquires why the rhinoceros, tiger, and weapons do not harm others. By posing this question, it seeks to clarify the matter for people.

**Master Hé Shànggōng said**: Why do rhinoceros, tiger, and weapons not harm?

**Róng said**: Why then? Because there is no place of death for them. The one who gives life to me is **God/Qi**, the one who kills me is my own mind. If I can extinguish the mind and still the thoughts, not entangle myself in activity, then there is no place of death.

**Chéng’s annotation**: By posing this question, the reason becomes clear. Because there is no place of death for them.

**The Great Master’s commentary**: This is the proper response. Those who see their own bodies as real are burdened by them; the deeper the attachment to life, the greater the power of death. Yet those who cultivate life virtuously perceive the **emptiness of dharma-nature (法性空)**, understanding that the body is merely a false appearance. Thus, they can forget life while in life, not err through excessive nurturing, and follow nature without selfishness—so there is no place of death to be found. Since the mind has no place of death, how can tiger, rhinoceros, or weapons harm their life?

**Master Hé Shànggōng said**: Because they do not violate the **thirteen divine prohibitions (神营护之, 此物不敢害之)**, the **Dao/Way** protects them, and these creatures dare not harm them.

**Chéng’s annotation**: Those who see their own bodies as real treat the body as a place of death. Now, those who cultivate life virtuously forget the false appearance of the body, and thus the body is without a body—there is no place of death. Since there is no place of death, where can the **Three Poisons** strike? This answers the earlier question’s intent.

**Chapter Fifty-One of the *Dào Shēng* (Dao of Life-Giving) section.**」

Thus, this chapter follows the previous one, which established that those who cultivate life virtuously can employ **emptiness and authenticity (虚假)**. Here, the meaning branches into four distinctions:

1. **Illustrating the Dao/Way’s moral transformation and nurturing of the common people (黎元).**
2. **Exhorting all beings to revere the Dao/Way and hold virtue/power in high esteem.**
3. **Expounding the boundless compassion and transformative power of emptiness.**
4. **Concluding with the profound virtue/power that benefits others while forgetting one’s own merit.**

**First: Illustrating the Dao/Way’s moral transformation and nurturing of the common people.**

The forms of all living things, from the most base to the most refined, rely on the **cosmic breath (氤氲)** for their birth and the **subtle essence (妙)** for their spiritual dissemination. Though wisdom and folly differ, and noble and base forms vary, the great peng bird and the humble *yuan* (鴳) know not of distance, nor do the cicadas and crickets discern the seasons. The plum and willow bloom with fragrance in the moonlit night, while flowers and butterflies dazzle with their charm in the garden. What merit could compare to this natural function? The **Dao/Way** alone is constant.

It is like the great sea, containing all things, or like the heavens, covering all beneath. Within every flower and leaf, the **Dao/Way** resides.

The **Dao/Way** gives birth to them; **virtue/power** nurtures them.

**御疏 (Imperial Commentary) says:** *"The Dao/Way gives birth to them"* means the **Dao/Way** descends the harmonizing **qi**, refining all things so that each may live—thus, it is said the **Dao/Way** gives birth to them. The **Dao/Way** is called the **Mystic Source (妙本)**, for it is the origin of the **qi** that sustains all things, hence the name *Mystic Source*.

*"Virtue/power nurtures them"*—**virtue/power** is what is **obtained (得)**, and **nurturing** is **cultivation (畜)**. All things obtain the **Dao/Way’s** function and are thereby nurtured; this is why it is said **virtue/power** nurtures them.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** gives birth to all things.

**Chéng’s annotation:** The supreme **Dao/Way**, vast and mysterious, gives life to all things. The highest **virtue/power** is compassionate and sustaining, nurturing all beings—thus, it is said the **Dao/Way** gives birth, and **virtue/power** nurtures.

**Form shapes them; circumstances complete them.**

**御注 (Imperial Annotation) says:** The **Dao/Way** gives birth, **virtue/power** nurtures, and thus all things take form—hence, *"form shapes them."* The *Yì Jīng (Book of Changes)·Xì Cí (Systematic Phrases)* states: *"The Creative (乾) knows the Great Beginning; the Receptive (坤) completes the things."* Heaven and Earth provide form; above and below establish position—all these are the **Dao/Way’s** functions, entrusted to the Creative and Receptive for their operation.

*"Circumstances complete them"* means that all things rely on the **Dao/Way’s** transformation of the seasons, the advantages of earth and sky, and the interplay of yin and yang to achieve their fulfillment—thus, *"circumstances complete them."*

**御疏 (Imperial Commentary) says:** *"Form shapes them"* aligns with *"the Creative knows, the Receptive completes, form and position are established."* *"Circumstances complete them"* refers to the **Dao/Way** giving birth and **virtue/power** nurturing, as all things take form. The Creative knows the Great Beginning; the Receptive completes the things. Heaven and Earth provide form; above and below establish position. The interplay of yin and yang fulfills them—thus, *"circumstances complete them."* The forces of cold and heat each achieve their own completion.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:** *"Form shapes them"*—this establishes the likeness of all things. *"Circumstances complete them"*—this fulfills all things with the forces of cold and heat.

**Yán (严) says:** *"Form shapes them"* refers to the Creative knowing and the Receptive completing form and position. *"Circumstances complete them"* means the interplay of cold and heat, each achieving fulfillment.

**Róng (荣) says:** The supreme **Dao/Way** moves without obstruction—what place cannot it reach? The profound **virtue/power** acts without stagnation—what matter cannot it accomplish?

Now, considering their functions:
When the **Dao/Way** gives birth, its principle returns to the **Dao/Way**.
When **virtue/power** nurtures, its meaning lies in **virtue/power**.
Birth and nurturing belong to things, and each thing takes form.
Once they sprout and their substance matures, birth and nurturing together achieve completion.

**Chéng’s annotation:** *"Form shapes them"* refers to perceiving the **Dao/Way** and manifesting its substance—this elucidates *"the Dao/Way gives birth."* *"Circumstances complete them"* speaks of guiding transformation through **virtue/power**, refining the spirit, and ensuring conduct becomes pure and accomplished—this elucidates *"virtue/power nurtures."*

**Second: Exhorting all beings to revere the Dao/Way and hold virtue/power in high esteem.**

Thus, all things without exception revere the **Dao/Way** and hold **virtue/power** in high esteem.

**御注 (Imperial Annotation) says:** All things owe their birth and nurturing to **moral cultivation (道德)**, hence they revere and honor it. Since the **Dao/Way** has the function of giving birth and nurturing, all who cherish life naturally revere the **Dao/Way** and respect **virtue/power**. This exhorts all beings to uphold their roots and exalt the **Dao/Way**.

The world’s honors and dignities are conferred by rulers alone, yet the **Dao/Way’s** eminence and **virtue/power’s** nobility arise solely from its function of giving birth and completing all things.

**御疏 (Imperial Commentary) says:** Since **moral cultivation** has the function of giving birth and nurturing, all who cherish life naturally revere the **Dao/Way** and respect **virtue/power**. This exhorts all beings to follow the teachings of their roots and exalt the **Dao/Way**.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way’s** and **virtue/power’s** deeds are such that all things naturally hold them in reverence—this is their constant, spontaneous honor.

**Yán (严) says:** All things owe their birth and nurturing to **moral cultivation**, hence they revere and honor it.

**Róng (荣) says:** Parents give birth to us; heaven and earth shelter us—truly, they are worthy of reverence. Now, the **Dao/Way’s** and **virtue/power’s** blessings surpass those of parents, and their merits overshadow those of heaven and earth. By right, they should be held in highest esteem.

**Chéng’s annotation:** The **Dao/Way’s** and **virtue/power’s** nurturing and sheltering are as described above. The people rely on them daily without knowing it, hence the exhortation to revere and hold them in high esteem.

The **Dao/Way’s** eminence and **virtue/power’s** nobility—none confer titles upon them, yet they are naturally revered.

**御注 (Imperial Annotation) says:** The eminence of **moral cultivation** is not conferred by titles, but their function of giving birth and completing all things makes them naturally noble.

**御疏 (Imperial Commentary) says:** The honors of past ages were conferred by rulers alone, yet the **Dao/Way’s** eminence and **virtue/power’s** nobility arise solely from their function of giving birth and completing all things. Thus, all things naturally revere them—not by conferred titles, but by their inherent, spontaneous nobility.

**Master Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way**, singular and unsummoned, naturally responds to all things like an echo to its sound.

**Yán (严) says:** The eminence of **moral cultivation** is not conferred by titles, but their function of giving birth and completing all things makes them naturally noble.

**○ Róng says:** When **moral cultivation** is emptied and forgotten, it naturally attains eminence and nobility—not by conferred titles, but only then does it earn reverence and esteem.

**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** The eminence and honor of the world must rely on rank and office, yet this is not enduring. But the eminence of **moral cultivation** and **virtue/power** is unrelated to titles, hence it is ever naturally so.

**Third:** Broadly manifesting emptiness and universality, **palace of compassion** and **transformative birth**. Thus, the **Dao/Way** gives birth to all things and nurtures them.
**Imperial Commentary:** "Increase and growth daily" (增进日长).
**○ Imperial Commentary:** This concludes the initial chapter’s meaning of the **Dao/Way** giving birth. To begin is to give birth; to nourish is to raise.

**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way**’s relation to all things is not merely to give birth—it further fosters, matures, and nurtures them to perfection, preserving their nature and life. Likewise, a ruler governing state and self should act thus.

**○ Yán says:** "Giving birth and nurturing" concludes the first two lines, with "increase and growth daily" as *rù* (抚, to nurture) and *yù* (育, to cultivate), *chén* (成, to perfect) as mutual aid, *shú* (熟, to mature) as completion, and *yǎng* (养, to nourish) as provision. *Fù* (覆, to shelter) is protection—these eight are the functions of **moral cultivation**, hence their eminence and nobility.

**○ Róng says:** This broadly elucidates the **Dao/Way’s** function of giving birth and nurturing. "Increase and growth daily," "nurture and cultivate daily," "establish and perfect daily," "fulfill and mature daily," "provide and nourish daily," "clothe and shelter daily."

**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** This reiterates prior text to introduce what follows. Yet it speaks only of the **Dao/Way** and not **virtue/power**, for **virtue/power** does not differ from the **Dao/Way**, though the text is concise. Thus, the *Xī Shēng Jīng* (《西升经》) states: **"Moral cultivation** is a chaotic unity, profound and mysterious in harmony."

**Long** (長) **them, nurture** (育) **them.**
**Imperial Commentary:** "Nurture" means to soothe and comfort.
**○ Imperial Commentary:** "Increase and growth daily" is nurturing; "soothe and comfort" is cultivation.

**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** "Long" refers to fostering their virtuous sprouts; "nurture" refers to advancing their practice.

**Perfect** (成) **them, mature** (熟) **them.**
**Imperial Commentary:** "Perfect" and "mature" are the same as "nourish" and "shelter"—thus, all revere the **Dao/Way** and hold **virtue/power** noble.

**○ Imperial Commentary:** "Mutual aid" is perfection; "completion" is maturation.

**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** With the supreme wondrous method, refining all things’ minds, the **Dao/Way’s** fruit is perfected, **virtue/power’s** practice refined—this is merely reiterating prior language to introduce what follows.

**Nourish** (养) **them, shelter** (覆) **them.**
**○ Imperial Commentary:** "Provide and sustain daily" is nourishment; "shade and protect daily" is shelter. These eight are the functions of **moral cultivation**, hence all things revere and hold it noble.

**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** "Nourish" means repaying their fruits; "shelter" means shading them with great compassion.

The above four pairs elucidate the **virtue/power’s** benefit to all things; the following three sentences reveal its capacity to transcend function.

**Fourth:** Concluding the **profound virtue/power**, benefiting all while forgetting its own function.

**Giving birth yet not possessing** (生而不有),
**Imperial Commentary:** "Giving birth yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, fostering yet not ruling"—this is called **profound virtue/power**, as fully explained in the *Zǎi Yīng Pò* chapter. That chapter speaks of human cultivation as the **Dao/Way**; this chapter clarifies the **Dao/Way’s** use aligning with humanity.

**○ Imperial Commentary:** The **Dao/Way** gives birth to all things, yet does not appear to possess what it generates, forgetting its generative function—concluding the **Dao/Way’s** generative meaning.

**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** generates all things yet takes nothing for itself—this is its beneficence.

**○ Róng says:** "Giving birth yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, fostering yet not ruling"—this is **profound virtue/power**. Those who claim its function are not its true functionaries; those who rely on its **virtue/power** are not its great practitioners. Now, since it neither relies nor rules while giving birth and fostering, this is the deepest, most mysterious **virtue/power**.

**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** Though it can generate all things, in truth there is nothing to generate. Like the straw dog of common sentiment, it is thus "giving birth yet not possessing"—having yet not having, generating yet not generating. This transcends the **Dao/Way’s** generative function.

**Acting yet not relying** (為而不恃),
**○ Imperial Commentary:** **Virtue/power’s** nurturing does not appear to act upon things; it does not rely on its function—concluding the **virtue/power’s** meaning of nurturing.

**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** may act, yet does not expect recompense.

**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** Having generated and perfected all things, it possesses no claim to their birth. Applying laws and teachings, upon what may it rely? This transcends **virtue/power’s** nurturing function.

**Fostering yet not ruling** (長而不宰),
**○ Imperial Commentary:** With **moral cultivation** forgetting the functions of giving birth and nurturing, though it stands as the longest among all things—fostering, maturing, and perfecting them—it does not rule or demand recompense from them. This is said to urge rulers to model themselves after the **Dao/Way’s** generative nurturing while forgetting its function.

**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way** fosters all things yet does not carve or dominate them for use.

**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** Fostering the people’s lives, its function equals that of creation itself, yet both agent and recipient are illusory—who then rules? This transcends the four pairs of "long," "nurture," etc.

**This is called profound virtue/power.**
**○ Imperial Commentary:** This is the praise of forgetting.

**Profound** (玄) **is the name for what is deep and unfathomable.** Though the Great **Dao/Way** can generate and nurture, it ultimately neither relies nor rules. Its **virtue/power** is universally pervasive, yet its traces are not manifest—is this not the deepest, most unfathomable **virtue/power**?

**○ Hé Shànggōng says:** The **Dao/Way’s** actions are profound and obscure, unseen.

**○ Chéng’s Commentary:** This refers to the preceding sentence and points to what follows. **Profound** is the name for what is deep and far-reaching; **virtue/power** is its protective manifestation, referring to those who embody the **Dao/Way**, benefit all while forgetting function, and follow the Sage—truly **profound virtue/power**.

---
**Chapter 52: The Origin of All Under Heaven**
This chapter follows the previous one, which expounds on the **Dao/Way’s** capacity for transformation and benefiting all while forgetting its own function. Hence, this chapter reveals the **Dao/Way** as the **Origin-Mother**, urging all to cultivate it. Its meaning is divided into four parts:
1. The **Dao/Way** as the **Origin-Mother**, exhorting all to begin cultivation.
2. The method of cultivation and the mystery of closure.
3. A general exposition of the paths of emptiness, existence, insight, and practice.
4. The obscuring of traces and concealing of light to perpetuate the **Dao/Way**.

**First, it is declared that the Dao/Way is the Origin-Mother, exhorting all to begin cultivation.**

The true principle is named for its **roundness and coldness**, while its wondrous root is called **void and permeating**—thus it nurtures all things as a child, gives birth to all forms as a mother, and responds to the world with **great authority**. It contains the void within its grasp, motionless and tranquil, yet able to wander at the dawn of things. In stillness and silence, it forgets all, returning to the root of the Dao/Way.

Confucius composed his discourse, and yet he marveled as if struck by a dragon.
Zhuangzi perfected his words, yet he submerged his form like an ant.

If one **blocks the senses** and **shuts the gate**, laboring ceases for life—
and thus one’s vitality is fully preserved.

**The Origin of All Under Heaven is the Mother of All Under Heaven.**

**御注:** *The Origin is the primal qi; this wondrous qi generates all things, possessing nurturing virtue, hence it can be the Mother of All Under Heaven.*
**御疏:** *The Origin is the daily qi; the Mother is the daily nurturing. The Dao, through this primal qi, generates all things—just as a mother gives birth to her children, hence it is called the Mother of All Under Heaven.*

Though the Origin-Mother differs from the Dao/Way’s qi, its transformation is ever unified.
Thus, the Classic above says:
*"Nameless, it is the Origin of Heaven and Earth;
Named, it is the Mother of all things."*

This is spoken to make one know the source and recognize the root,
to guard the Mother while preserving the child.

**River-Upper Master says:**
*"The Origin of All Under Heaven is the Dao/Way.
The Mother of All Under Heaven is the Dao/Way as the Mother of all things."*

**Rong says:**
*"The Dao/Way is the root of things, hence it is called the Origin.
Its virtue nurtures, hence it is called the Mother."*

**成注:**
*The Origin is the root of the Dao/Way;
The Mother is the trace of the Dao/Way.
The profound Dao/Way, the wondrous root,
the great source of wisdom—
transcending names and forms, beyond all colors and images—
all things under Heaven arise from it.
Now, speaking broadly of "All Under Heaven," it is to make practitioners recognize the root and know the origin.
Thus, the Classic above says:
*"Nameless, it is the Origin of Heaven and Earth."*
*"The Mother of all things"* means:
From the root descending, guiding the masses,
nurturing and raising them like a mother loves her child.
Thus, the Classic above says:
*"Named, it is the Mother of all things."*
Once the Mother is known, the child is understood.

**御注:**
*When all things obtain the primal qi’s nurturing,
they know their own bodies—
these are the children of the primal qi.*

**御疏:**
*When one obtains the harmonious qi,
nurturing as the Mother,
one should know that the body is the child of the primal qi.*

**River-Upper Master says:**
*"The child is the One."*
Having known the Dao/Way, one must also know the One.

**Rong says:**
*"The Dao/Way’s virtue nurtures and sustains—
this is the meaning of Mother.
Things arise from the Dao/Way—
the child is thus known."*

**成注:**
*The root gives rise to the trace;
the trace gives rise to things.
Having obtained the Dao/Way’s great compassion,
which guides and receives the common folk—
this is my Mother.
Only then does one know that the body
is the Dao/Way’s child,
born from the Dao/Way.*

The Classic says:
*"The void and natural is the true Parent-Mother."*
Having known the child, one must again guard the Mother—
then the body will not perish.

**御注:**
*Having known the body is the child of the primal qi,
one must guard this harmonious, wondrous qi,
preventing its dispersal,
thus preserving the body throughout life—
the body will then face no danger.*

**御疏:**
*Having known the body is the child of the Dao/Way’s qi,
born from the Dao/Way’s qi,
one must guard the Dao/Way’s purity,
untainted by delusion,
nurturing the qi and preserving the spirit,
so it does not scatter.
Humans arise from the Dao/Way,
and return to the Dao/Way.
Now, instead of seeking the Dao/Way,
one must return and guard it—
thus, "guard the Mother again."
To preserve the body without peril means
that one can accumulate virtue in hidden and manifest deeds,
harming no thing—
hence, "no peril."*

This clarifies that Mother and child guard each other,
root and branch gather—
those who practice this bring stability to their families and states.

**成注:**
*Having known oneself as the Dao/Way’s child,
one must return and guard the Mother.
Only by returning to the root and guarding the Mother,
uniting with the Dao/Way and attaining the True,
does one’s trace—whether existing or not—
remain without peril or danger.
For the Dao/Way gives birth to things;
the Dao/Way is the root.
Things arise from the Dao/Way;
things are the branches.
Since the root can govern the branches,
one must return.
Since the Mother gives birth to the child,
one must guard.
Guarding the Mother ensures longevity;
returning to the root ensures the body’s preservation—
hence the exhortation.*

The *Western Ascension Scripture* says:
*"Constantly nurturing the Mother,
the body will endure."*

---
**Second, it reveals the method of cultivation and the mystery of closure.**

**Block the senses, shut the gate—**
then labor ceases for life.

**御注:**
*"Senses"* refers to delight.
The eyes delight in colors, the ears in sounds—
each of the six senses has its delight.
If indulged, they bring affliction—
thus, they must be blocked.
Not indulging the six senses’ delights
closes the gate of calamity,
so one’s life remains motionless and free of toil.

**御疏:**
*This expounds the practice of cutting desire and guarding the Mother.
"Senses" means delight—
the ears and eyes delight in sounds and colors,
the nose and mouth in fragrances and flavors—
each of the six senses has its delight.
"The gate" refers to the passage of the senses and dust.
Blocking the delights of sight and hearing
closes the gate of calamity.
With calamity extinguished and the gate shut,
one’s life requires no labor—
hence, "labor ceases for life."*

**River-Upper Master says:**
*"Block the senses"—
the senses are the eyes;
do not gaze wantonly.
"Shut the gate"—
the gate is the mouth;
do not speak falsely."*

「终身不救，人当开目视情欲，济事益情，则祸乱日增，终身难以救拔。○

**Honor’s Saying:**
*Those who stray from the Dao and are mired in worldly affairs,
abandoning the Source to seek the branches,
open the six senses’ delights,
unleash the five desires’ gates—
though they achieve what is burdened with names,
they forever lose the Way of *Wuwei*,
and perish without hope of redemption.*

○

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*When the foolish act thus,
they open the eyes and ears and other senses,
indulging in colors, sounds, and other sensory pleasures,
and throughout their lives they are ensnared by lust and debauchery.
Even if the greatest sages and most compassionate beings exist,
they cannot save or deliver such individuals from their sight.*

---

**The Third Principle:** *To discern the subtle—this is called "clear-sightedness."*
**River-Upper Master’s Annotation:**
*"Subtle"* refers to the sprouts of calamity before they manifest.
*"Clear-sightedness"* is the solitary perception of such hidden changes.

○

**Honor’s Saying:**
*Discerning the subtle is called "clear-sightedness,"
practicing gentleness is called "strength."*
*When calamity first arises, it is subtle—
those who can foresee and prevent it are clear-sighted.*
*Conforming to the Dao without resistance is gentleness,*
*and those who remain steadfast in this are strong.*

○

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*"Discern"* means insightful observation.
*"Subtle"* refers to the finest, most refined principles—
that is, the most profound truth.
If one can observe this subtle truth,
wisdom and insight grow ever brighter,
hence the saying: *"Observe its subtlety."*

*"Practicing gentleness is called strength."*
**River-Upper Master’s Annotation:**
*To uphold gentleness and weakness*
*is to become ever stronger and greater.*

○

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Having discerned the subtle,
wisdom and insight naturally increase.
Moreover, if one can apply the Dao,
maintaining humility, modesty, and gentleness,
then one’s virtue and deeds grow ever stronger.*

*At the outset of learning the Dao,
there are *dìng* (calm abiding) and *huì* (insight),
there is practice and understanding.
Discerning the subtle is the gateway to insight and understanding,
while practicing gentleness is the unfolding of calm abiding and action.
Thus, among the Six Perfections,
the first five are actions,
and the last is understanding—
understanding is insight,
while action encompasses both calm abiding and insight.
To guide the named through the empty,
and to enrich the empty through the named,
one must clarify the interplay of these principles—
hence the emphasis on "practicing gentleness and discerning the subtle."*

---

**The Fourth Principle:** *To obscure one’s traces and conceal one’s light,*
*thus continuing the unchanging Dao.*
*"Employing one’s light,"*
*yet returning to its source—this is called "clear-sightedness."*

**Commentary of the Master:**

To perceive the subtle is to attain clarity,
to cultivate gentleness is to grow in strength.
If one boasts of clarity and wields strength,
one will lose the essence of perceiving the subtle and guarding gentleness.
Thus, one must employ light outwardly,
yet return to its source within—
then will one endure without affliction.

**Exegesis of the Master:**

Light radiates outward and is ever in motion,
while clarity resides inward and remains ever still.
Through perceiving the subtle and guarding gentleness,
one attains strength without arrogance or force.
Though light shines outward, it must return to inner clarity—
this is the transformation of perceiving the subtle and guarding gentleness,
leading one to rest externally while returning internally.
Hence it is said: *return to its source within.*

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
*Employing one’s light*—
to use one’s vision outwardly,
to discern the advantages and harms of the times.
*Returning to its source*—
to restore one’s luminosity inward,
lest vital essence be dissipated.

**Master Yan says:**
The spirit moves outward—
to employ light outwardly,
without transgressing sustenance,
without seeking excess.
When held in low regard, one does not aspire to nobility;
when impoverished, one does not covet wealth.
Thus, one returns to inner clarity,
and the spirit’s luminosity is not exhausted.

I enter the Dao, and the Dao enters me—
I and the Dao merge as one.
Guarding stillness to attain emptiness,
I become the root of the Dao.
Nature’s responses unfold spontaneously.

**Master Rong says:**
To employ one’s light and return to its source
is to avoid calamity for the body.
Wisdom illuminates the moment,
using light to avert disaster.
To perceive before manifestation,
pure and without loss,
to reflect inward and return to clarity—
thus, one suffers no harm,
and the body incurs no misfortune.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Light is the illumination of wisdom.
Having attained the unity of emptiness and action,
one’s wisdom shines upon all things.
Though light is employed to illuminate,
it is forgotten in its application—
concealing light, obscuring traces,
returning clarity to obscurity.
Hence it is said: *return to its source.*

The passage below states:
*"Shining without brilliance"*—
as in *Zhuangzi*, the doubt of sliding doubt,
the aspiration of the Sage.
To avoid calamity for the body
is called *inheriting the constant.*

**Commentary of the Master:**
*遗 (yí)*—to bestow.
To return to inner clarity,
then one incurs no blame or harm upon the body.
Thus, it is said: *this is the secret practice of the constant Dao.*

**Exegesis of the Master:**
*遗 (yí)*—to bestow.
*殃 (yāng)*—blame.
Though light illuminates externally,
it does not cling to objects;
returning to inner clarity,
one does not boast or display.
Guarding the mother while abandoning the child,
restoring reflection to its source—
thus, there is no blame or harm.
This is called *inheriting the constant*—
secret practice is called *inheriting*,
as one discerns the subtle and wards off harm,
guarding gentleness while containing clarity.
Such conduct is called *knowing the child while guarding the mother*,
the secret practice of the constant Dao.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
To avoid calamity for the body—
to reflect inward and preserve the spirit,
lest there be leakage or loss.
This is called *inheriting the constant*—
if one practices this, it is called *cultivating the constant Dao.*

**Master Rong says:**
Thus, *inheriting the constant*:
to indulge emotions and extreme desires,
to defy the root while following the branches—
then calamity and hardship arise,
returning to the impermanent.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Having known illumination and forgotten it,
with perfect virtue complete,
all entanglements exhausted,
no lingering harm or blame remains.
It is also said:
*遗 (yí)*—to bestow—
no further harm or provocation befalls the body.
With conduct perfected and entanglements exhausted,
the transmission of the lamp reaches its true inheritor—
truly, this person may be said to inherit the constant Dao,
to uphold and glorify the true teaching.

**Chapter 53: If I Were to Be Resolute in Knowledge**

**Master’s Commentary:**
The Sage speaks:
If I were to be resolutely proud of my knowledge,
desiring to walk the Great Dao,
since my ways conflict with the Dao,
all my actions would be cause for dread.

**Exegesis of the Master:**
*If I*—
the Sage’s hypothetical speech.
*介然 (jièrán)*—proud and resolute,
the appearance of one who possesses knowledge.
The Dao is not a matter of knowing laws;
yet if one, with knowledge, seeks to walk the Great Dao of non-action,
the Sage laments their delusion,
for knowledge clashes with the Dao,
losing the purity of non-action.
Thus, all their deeds would harm others—
truly, a cause for dread.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
*If I were to be resolute in knowledge*—
*介 (jiè)*—great.
The Sage deplores the rulers of his time,
who do not walk the Great Dao.
He posits:
If I were to be resolutely knowledgeable in governance,
I would instead walk the Great Dao of non-action,
abolishing the tyranny of authority.
*唯施是畏*—
*唯 (wéi)*—solely.
Solely dreading that one’s actions
deviate from the Dao’s intent—
to reward the virtuous, yet fear the rise of false virtue;
to trust the loyal, yet fear the emergence of deceitful loyalty.

**Master Rong says:**
The Dao Master laments that rulers of his age do not follow the level path,
but tread the crooked ways instead—
adorned in fine colors yet girded with sharp blades,
sated with food yet hoarding wealth.
Fields lie fallow and barren,
granaries stand empty and void.
These are but men who boast of the Dao—
how could they know the purity of true practice?

If I were but slightly knowledgeable in governance,
I would walk the Great Dao of non-action,
never straying onto the narrow paths of contrivance.
In all my deeds, I would most fear failing to uphold it.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*"If I were"*—this is a hypothetical speech.
*"Knowledge"*—discrimination.
*"Slightly"*—small and subtle.
The true Dao is supremely level and plain,
yet if one were to stir even a slight thought of knowing and acting,
this would be to stir up false distinctions—
a movement that is deeply perilous.

For the Ultimate Dao is void and boundless,
transcending all distinctions.
It neither clings to falsity nor to truth,
for truth and falsity share the same essence,
and life and death are one continuum.
It enters the nine abysses yet remains unobscured,
passes through the three realms yet remains unilluminated,
walks through peril yet remains at ease,
faces great calamity yet knows no fear—
thus, there is no dread.

But now, with thoughts and distinctions arising,
one strays from the original heart.
All deeds become steps toward ruin—
thus, they are truly to be feared.

The Great Dao is supremely level,
yet people love the crooked paths.

**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
The Great Dao is plain and easy,
yet those with knowledge fear it—
for men, being prone to schemes,
seek shortcuts, like travelers preferring winding trails.
The harms of such paths are detailed below.

**Master Yu’s Commentary:**
*Level*—plain.
*Paths*—crooked and swift.
The Great Dao is broad and unobstructed,
yet people prefer crooked shortcuts.
But the Dao’s transformation lies in non-action—
non-action is plain and easy.
Yet those who govern instead
cannot still their minds in desirelessness,
but labor their hearts to meet demands.
Though they may initially seek shortcuts for speed,
they ultimately lose the Dao and disrupt harmony—
hence, *"people love the crooked paths."*

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
The Great Dao is supremely level—
*level*—plain,
*great*—easy.
Yet people love crooked paths—
*paths*—crooked, not straight.

**Master Rong says:**
The true path is level and easy,
the crooked paths are treacherous and difficult.
Those who govern often tread the difficult,
while those who cultivate the self rarely follow the easy—
a rejection of the Dao’s way.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Level*—plain and just.
*Paths*—crooked ways.
The ultimate truth is perfectly equal,
without distinction.
Yet those who invert it,
abandoning the straight for the crooked,
cause the Great Dao to stagnate,
while petty achievements blaze unchecked.

---
**Second, it clarifies that those without the Dao are gluttonous and greedy.**

**The court is excessively adorned,**
**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
It prizes the clever and fosters deceitful ingenuity.
*Adorned*—governed.

**Master Yu’s Commentary:**
*Adorned*—governed.
Those who love crooked paths do not uphold the transformation of non-action,
but take contrivance as governance.
Though they claim to govern well,
contrivance breeds deceit—
hence the annotation: *"It prizes the clever and fosters deceitful ingenuity."*

Or it may mean:
The court refines its structures—
tall halls and carved walls—
hence, *"excessively adorned."*

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
High pavilions and grand palaces,
elaborate halls and chambers.

**Master Rong says:**
The court is excessively adorned,
fields lie utterly overgrown.
Carved walls and towering halls—
demolishing the old to build the new—
burdens the people, neglecting the tillage,
while fertile lands grow wild.
Pursuing fame and gain,
they abandon the little for the much,
neglecting the Dao’s cultivation,
letting the elixir fields lie fallow.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Rulers who stray from the Dao
love crooked paths,
do not uphold simplicity,
but indulge in extravagance.
They demolish old halls to build new palaces,
carving beams and engraving pillars,
exhausting all in ornate beauty.

**Fields lie utterly overgrown,**
**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
Idle consumption and laziness ruin agricultural work.

**Master Yu’s Commentary:**
Grass grows thick and fields lie abandoned,
as idle consumption and deceitful labor
cause agriculture to decay.
When the harvest fails to yield,
how can one expect abundant stores?

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
Agricultural labor is neglected,
plowing and tilling fall out of season.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
With forced labor multiplying,
farmers abandon their fields,
leaving the eastern slopes uncultivated,
the southern fields in ruin.

**Granaries stand utterly empty.**
**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
The southern fields yield no harvest,
leaving no reserves.

**Master Yu’s Commentary:**
A bountiful year fills the granaries,
but neglected fields leave them empty—
a natural consequence.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
The five grains are harmed,
the nation has no stores.

**Master Rong says:**
A bountiful year fills the granaries,
neglected fields leave them empty.
Light governance leads to empty stores,
virtue fulfilled brings the Dao to fruition.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
The harvest is limited,
yet national expenses know no end—
the spinning wheels stand idle,
the granaries grow empty.

**They wear fine embroidery,**
**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
Carved and painted, embroidered and brocaded—
harming artisans and profits.

**Master Yu’s Commentary:**
Green and red form patterns,
silk threads create colors—
valuing ornament over substance.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
They love false adornment,
prizing outward splendor.

**Master Rong says:**
They wear fine embroidery,
gird themselves with sharp blades—
abandoning simplicity for ornament,
valuing force over culture.
Those who cultivate the true way
do not inwardly possess virtue and the Dao,
but merely adorn themselves with ritual and bearing.
Their malicious intent remains unchecked—
they gird themselves with sharp blades.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
They wear fine embroidery,
gird themselves with sharp blades,
disdain food and drink,
adorn themselves with brocade and embroidery,
guard their lives with keen blades,
savor wine and rich meats to refresh their palates—
they do not uphold supreme virtue,
nor care for the people below.
Alas, how gluttonous and greedy they are!

**They gird themselves with sharp blades,**
**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
Supreme virtue is not cultivated,
yet military preparedness is prized.

**Master Yu’s Commentary:**
Sharp blades are military preparedness.
Supreme virtue is the instrument of governance,
while military strength is its auxiliary—
virtue is the root, force the foam.
If one now prioritizes force,
it is to abandon the root and exalt the secondary.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
They prize strength and extravagance.

**They sicken of food and drink,**
**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
They indulge in rich flavors—
*厌* means gluttony, sated to excess.

**Master Yu’s Commentary:**
*厌* means sated to excess.
When the kitchen overflows with thick, rich fare,
and they gorge themselves on fragrant delicacies,
the ruler lavishes upon himself costly provisions,
while the people below suffer from hunger and cold.
*厌饮食*, their wealth is abundant,
yet their desires are insatiable,
and they lack moderation in all things.

**Master Rong says:**
*厌饮食*, their wealth is abundant—
Yet true flavor lies in the harmony of simple sustenance,
and the virtue of the Way.
The refined scholar finds joy in plain grains and humble fare,
and scatters his wealth without greed,
for such is the treasure of the unselfish.
This is the balance of inner and outer perfection.
But to gorge on fragrant delicacies,
to hoard pearls and jade—
such is the conduct of thieves and boasters,
not the foundation of a noble realm.

**Their wealth is abundant,**
**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
They amass rare treasures and store excess goods.

**Master Yu’s Commentary:**
Wealth refers to coin, silk, pearls, and jade.
To hoard and accumulate deeply—
that is excess.
The shallow scholar may call non-greed a treasure,
but they only seek to pile up riches,
to burden the foolish with their gluttony.
**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Light and reckless in their extravagance,
they debauch themselves in governance.
They impose heavy taxes upon the people,
yet their hoards overflow with excess—
these are the third kind of men,
those who pervert the highest Dao.
They are called *qiá* (boasters) and thieves,
for they are not of the Way.

**Master Yu’s Annotation:**
They boast of their cleverness,
yet their actions breed chaos—
their deeds mirror thieves and boasters,
yet they still pride themselves in excess.
*Qiá* (boasters) and thieves are not of the Dao,
and thus one sighs in lament.

**The *yězāi* (also so) is a word of sorrow.**
**Master Yu’s Commentary:**
To take without right is theft,
to vaunt what one possesses is boasting.
They gather wealth from those who lack,
and squander it upon their own desires,
proudly indulging in their excess—
to call them boasters and thieves is fitting.
Such conduct is not what I wish to uphold,
and thus I sigh in lament.
*The *yězāi* (also so) is a word of sorrow.*

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
They are boasters and thieves—
when the people lack,
yet the ruler has abundance,
it is because they force labor upon the people
to adorn themselves with fine garments,
to parade in ostentation before others,
unaware that death may come,
and their homes be ruined,
with kin following them into ruin.
This is not the Dao, indeed—
when the ruler acts thus,
this is not the Dao.
Again, *yězāi* (also so),
a word of deep sorrow.

**Master Yan says:**
The virtue/power and Dao are not achieved through cleverness and skill,
yet they can transform the world,
and give rise to the transformations of yin and yang.
The heavens and earth do not rely on cleverness and skill,
yet they can embrace and release with endless change,
and no thing can escape them.
They are simple yet profound,
concise yet effortless to follow,
effortless yet perfectly accomplished,
without action yet blessings arise.
Ah, it grieves me to see those who invert the Dao,
pursuing cleverness and skill,
acting violently in the world,
and thus clashing with the heavens.
This is not the Great Dao—
how could it not be a cause for deep sorrow?

**Master Rong says:**
To take from those who lack—
to hoard what is more than enough—
this is called theft.
To love adornment and excess—
to boast in fine words—
this is the meaning of vaunting.
Only theft and vaunting,
both are contrary to the Dao.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Heavy taxation and exactions,
like thieves and bandits.
Having amassed and stored wealth,
yet still proud and boasting,
contrary to reason and subverting virtue—
this is called not the Dao.

If one acts as a practitioner of the Dao yet remains in ignorance,
their fields grow overgrown—
their heart is neglected.
Their granaries lie empty—
they lack virtue/power.
Their garments are adorned with fine colors—
they delight in empty words.
They wear sharp blades—
their greedy heart is honed.
They weary of plain food—
they indulge in rich flavors.
Their goods overflow—
they hoard without giving.

*The Daoist True Classic of Mysterious Virtue/Power—
Commentary by Master Cheng, Volume Fourteen ends,*
*Volume Fifteen begins.*

「善建章」—**Chapter on the Foundation of Virtue/Power**

This chapter follows the previous one, for the prior chapter expounds upon those ensnared by greed and defilement, who stray from the norm and lose the Dao. Hence, this chapter clarifies those who harmonize with the Dao and align with the True, urging all to cultivate and practice, thus succeeding one another.

Within this chapter, the meaning is divided into three distinct teachings:
1. To elucidate those who establish virtue/power, shining the Dao for future generations;
2. To demonstrate how self-cultivation and benefiting others broadens their virtue/power;
3. To measure the extent of gain and harm, thereby exhorting students of the Dao.

**First: To elucidate those who establish virtue/power, shining the Dao for future generations.**
The Yellow Emperor, through his casting of the Tripod and ascending of the Dragon, established the Dao’s radiance.
The Huai King, with his elixir of immortality and mastery over cranes, ascended to the realm of the Purple Forbidden.
In the land of the Wondrous Milky Way, the myriad sages gathered at the Hall of Pure Jade.
In the Heaven of Verdant Clarity, the thousand True Ones convened at the Precious Tiles.
How did they attain such heights?
Through the **virtue/power** of establishing virtue/power.

Observe Chen Zhi’s cultivation in his village—virtuous stars gathered afar—and hear of Duke Jing of Qi’s cultivation in his realm—Mars receded in flight.
He tasted the wine of the crossroads, finding harmony in its balance,
and discarded his left-hand chariot horse to behold beauty in its purity.
The Zhou were called the "Great Treasure’s descendants," ruling for eight hundred years,
while the marketplace of Qi returned righteousness,
its gates hosting three thousand guests.
The **virtue/power of the unshakable** is thus manifest.

Those who establish virtue/power are **unshakable**.
**Imperial Commentary:** The sage who can establish the Dao in governance and lay the foundation for the realm cannot be overthrown or uprooted.
**Imperial Exegesis:** *Establish* means to found. *Unshakable* means not to be toppled or uprooted.
It speaks of rulers who, through the Dao, establish their own conduct and the realm’s foundation.
When the people do not act corruptly,
and the myriad folk transform naturally,
then they refine them with sincerity,
nurture them with noble customs,
so that their laws inspire trust,
and their governance is without end.
Thus, their achievements are profound and lasting,
all under heaven returning to virtue/power.
Such is the **virtue/power of the unshakable**—how can they be overthrown?

**Master He Shang Gong** said: *Establish* means to found. Those who establish their conduct and the realm through the Dao cannot be dragged away or uprooted.

**Master Li Rong** said: Those who establish virtue/power are **unshakable**; those who embrace it are **unsevered**.
Their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.
If one can establish conduct within the realm of the supreme Dao,
then their roots are deep and **unshakable**.
If one cultivates marvelous virtue/power within the domain of the Mysterious,
then their base is firm and **unsevered**.

When governing a realm, their ancestral temples endure across generations,
and when managing a family, their offerings rise unbroken.
Their teachings flow like shadows from the True Qi,
and their legacy is sustained by the Mysterious Wind.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *Establish* means to found. *Unshakable* means not to be toppled.
Those who skillfully establish the Dao in their hearts and steady their resolve
in the True Dao’s realm are **unshakable**.

Those who embrace virtue/power are **unsevered**.
**Imperial Commentary:** If one can embrace the Dao and virtue/power to govern the people, they cannot be separated from it.

**Imperial Exegesis:** *Embrace* means to uphold. *Unsevered* means not to depart.
Those who embrace the Dao and virtue/power to govern the people—
when they move, the people follow in delight—
how can they ever depart?

Moreover, even delicious bait can retain a passing traveler,
yet how much more so the Dao and virtue/power,
which surpass this?
To wield them in governance,
the people will naturally return to them—
this is their proper course.

**Master He Shang Gong** said: Those who embrace the Dao to nurture their spirit
will never be dragged away or severed.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *Embrace* means to hold fast. *Unsevered* means not to lose.
The prior sentence speaks of the initial resolve,
this of the enduring practice.
It says those who hold fast to the True Dao—
once obtained, forever retained—
will never falter.

Their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.
**Imperial Commentary:** It speaks of those who establish and embrace the Dao and virtue/power,
whose merits extend to posterity,
who cherish their ancestral shade,
and whose descendants are perpetually nourished.

For the king, the ancestors have merit,
and the lineage has virtue.
Thus, the Zhou’s rise began with Hou Ji,
and its completion lay with King Wen and King Wu.
The Zhou’s sacrifices included:
the ancestral rites to Hou Ji,
the lineage rites to King Wen.
Even when divination predicted thirty-six generations,
and a lifespan of seven hundred years,
the ancestral rites to Hou Ji and King Wen
never ceased—
whether the main temple was destroyed,
or its streams overflowed beyond.

**Imperial Exegesis:** *Sacrifices* means to offer. *Unceasing* means daily rites.
It refers to descendants perpetually offering rites to their ancestors and lineage.
*Cease* means to stop.

**Master He Shang Gong** said: *Cease* means to cut off.
If one cultivates the Dao as such,
they attain longevity and immortality,
and their sacrifices to ancestors and temples
never end across generations.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *Cease* means to cut off.
Those who embrace virtue/power align with principle.
Once they hold to this True practice,
and transmit it to future generations,
it is like the Primordial Beginning passing to the Highest Sage,
or Xu Zhen imparting to Ge Xian.
The lineage of teachers and disciples continues,
forever serving as the master of instruction—
like the unbroken transmission of a lamp’s flame.

Thus, the *Sutra of Western Ascension* says:
*"Learn from me, teach from me—
never lose the True Dao."*

**Another Interpretation:** It speaks of those who establish virtue/power,
whose virtue is profound and lasting,
whose accumulated goodness brings blessings,
and whose lineage flourishes eternally,
their ancestral halls enduring forever.

**Second: To demonstrate how self-cultivation and benefiting others broadens their virtue/power.**
Cultivate in one’s self,
and their virtue/power becomes **True**.
**Imperial Commentary:** Cultivating the Dao in one’s person,
their virtue/power is **True** and pure.

**Imperial Exegesis:** Below, it clarifies that lesser cultivation yields lesser attainment,
while greater learning brings greater reward.
Thus, *cultivate in one’s self* refers to cultivating within one’s own body,
*cultivate in one’s family* refers to cultivating within one’s household.
Beginning with the self,
and ending with the world—
the pattern is clear.

It speaks of those who establish virtue/power,
whose **True Nature** is illuminated in purity,
free from all falsehood and impurity.
When falsehood and impurity are exhausted,
their virtue/power is **True** and pure.

**Master He Shang Gong** said: Cultivating the Dao in one’s self—
nurturing qi and spirit,
extending life and years—
their virtue/power is thus **True**, and they become True Ones.

**Master Li Rong** said: Cultivate in one’s self,
and their virtue/power is **True**.
Cultivate in one’s family,
and their virtue/power has excess.
Cultivate in one’s village,
and their virtue/power endures.
Cultivate in one’s realm,
and their virtue/power flourishes.
Cultivate in the world,
and their virtue/power is universal.
The Dao cannot be neglected in cultivation,
nor virtue/power in establishment.
To establish virtue/power and cultivate the Dao—
from the self to the family, to the realm—
wherever they go, they bring stability.

Death and life have no fixed day of change—**True** when it reaches descendants, called *余* (excess).
Near and far all find stability—**True** when it endures, called *长* (long).
All things self-sufficient—**True** when it flourishes, called *丰* (abundant).
Grace without exclusion—**True** when it is universal, called *普* (universal).

○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: Former cultivation and practice—
first refining one’s self,
then acting in harmony—
virtue/power becomes **True** and real.
Cultivate in one’s family,
and their virtue/power has excess.

○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** When an entire family cultivates,
their virtue/power overflows thus.

○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** Cultivating the Dao in one’s family,
superiors and inferiors in harmony—
extending self-cultivation to the family,
thus their virtue/power has excess,
meaning excess blessings.
Hence the *Yijing* says:
*"Families that accumulate goodness*
*must have excess blessings."*

○ **Master He Shang Gong** said: Cultivating the Dao in one’s family,
fathers are kind, sons are filial,
elders are friendly, younger ones respectful,
husbands obedient, wives chaste—
their virtue/power is thus,
and excess blessings extend to future generations.

○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: Cultivating oneself alone is self-beneficial,
illustrating self-interest.
Cultivating the family is mutual aid,
illustrating benefiting others.
Transforming one’s household,
and ordering them to cultivate the Dao—
their merit and practice gradually expand,
thus it is called *excess*.

In ancient times, the Celestial Master cultivated,
and his entire family attained immortality—
roosters crowed in the heavens,
dogs barked among the clouds.

Cultivate in one’s village,
and their virtue/power endures.

○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** When an entire village cultivates,
their virtue/power endures long.

○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** According to the *Zhou Li*,
a village consists of 2,500 families.
Speaking of a village cultivating the Dao,
rites and propriety flourish,
superiors and inferiors are in order,
neighbors respect one another,
without favoring kin.
One family cultivating the Dao—
their virtue/power is still limited.
An entire village cultivating—
then their virtue/power endures.

○ **Master He Shang Gong** said: Cultivating the Dao in one’s village,
honoring the aged,
cherishing the young,
teaching the foolish and ignorant—
their virtue/power is thus,
and nothing is left uncovered.

○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: Cultivating the family and village,
expanding from narrow to broad,
their transformative merit grows greater,
and their virtue/power is superior and enduring.

Cultivate in one’s realm,
and their virtue/power flourishes.

○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** When an entire realm cultivates,
their virtue/power becomes abundant.

○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** Cultivating the Dao in one’s realm,
customs shift, winds change,
returning to simplicity and purity,
not favoring the near.
A village cultivating the Dao—
still not yet universal.
An entire realm cultivating—
their virtue/power becomes rich and full.

○ **Master He Shang Gong** said: Cultivating the Dao in one’s realm,
then the ruler is trustworthy, ministers loyal,
benevolence and righteousness arise naturally,
rites and music flourish spontaneously,
governance is fair and impartial—
their virtue/power is thus,
and it is rich and full.

○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: The five ranks of feudal lords,
clearing their minds and cultivating the Dao,
thus achieving peace within their domains,
no worries within their borders—
how could they not be virtuous and sagely rulers,
with abundant virtue/power?

Cultivate in the world,
and their virtue/power is universal.

○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** If the world cultivates entirely,
their virtue/power spreads universally.

○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** *普* (universal) means *遍* (pervasive).
The people’s loyalty lies in the ruler’s transformation.
Cultivating in the hall of state,
virtue flows beyond the seas—
this is because the ruler rectifies himself,
transforming without speech,
governing without teaching.
The inferior responds to the superior,
like echoes answering sounds.
Virtue is without exclusion,
thus it is universal.

○ **Master He Shang Gong** said: When people cultivate the Dao in the world,
they transform without speech,
govern without teaching,
the inferior responds to the superior,
truthful as echoes to sounds.
Their virtue/power is thus,
and it is universally vast.

○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: The Sovereign of the Nine-and-Five [Emperor],
governing through the Dao,
serene and still, silent and tranquil,
the world attains great peace.
Thus all nations come to pay homage,
the four quarters submit in loyalty,
his blessings extend without limit—
thus his virtue/power is universal.

The third category measures gain and loss
to exhort those who study.

Thus, observe the self with the self—

○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe the self with the method of self-cultivation,
and the truly pure is **True**.

○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** *Observe* means *照察* (illuminate and examine).
The commentary says: Observe the self with the method of self-cultivation,
and the truly pure is **True**—
meaning to observe the true nature of the self,
originally pure and undefiled,
untainted by dust,
discarding all illusions.
When illusions are abandoned,
knowing emptiness is also emptiness,
suddenly uniting the two extremes,
urgently aligning with the Middle Way—
this is truly pure and **True**.

○ **Master He Shang Gong** said: Observe the cultivating self
with the uncultivated self—
who perishes, who survives?

○ **Master Li Rong** said: Thus, observe the self with the self,
the family with the family,
the village with the village,
the realm with the realm,
the world with the world.
The source of the ultimate Dao
is originally without good or evil.
The beginning of establishing virtue/power
must know right and wrong.
Those who know wrong will not linger in evil long,
those who know right will rush toward goodness.
Discerning vice and virtue,
illuminating survival and extinction—
the cultivating self returns to **True**,
the uncultivated enters falsehood.
The cultivating family has excess,
the uncultivated lacks.
The cultivating village endures long,
the uncultivated is brief.
The cultivating realm is abundant,
the uncultivated is poor.
Cultivating the world is universal,
the uncultivated is deficient.

○ **Master Cheng Xu** said: Thus, observe the self with the self,
the family with the family,
the village with the village,
the realm with the realm,
the world with the world—
how do I know the world is thus?
By this.
Emperors Yao and Shun attained peace
because they had the Dao.
Jie and Zhou were licentious and chaotic
because they lacked the Dao.
Thus, observing the cultivating self with the uncultivating self,
observing the Dao-filled world with the Dao-less world—
even the gains and losses of families and realms
can be clearly discerned.

Hence, the Old Master [Laozi] set forth:
*"How do I know the world’s successes and failures?*
*Only by this standard,*
*sufficient as a tortoise-shell mirror."*

Observe the family with the family—

○ **Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe the family with the method of family cultivation,
and the harmonious have excess.

○ **Imperial Citation (御疏):** Observe the family with the method of family cultivation,
and if family members are harmonious,
then blessings and fortune overflow.

○ **Master of the Riverbank [He Shang Gong] said:** Observe the family that cultivates the Dao with the family that does not cultivate the Dao.

Observe the village with the village,
**Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe the village with the method of village cultivation, and those who follow order shall endure.
**Imperial Citation (御疏):** Apply this method of village cultivation to observe the village—when all villagers cultivate, with hierarchy in order, the transformative influence spreads, and virtue endures.

○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Observe the village that cultivates the Dao with the village that does not cultivate the Dao.

Observe the realm with the realm,
**Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe the realm with the method of realm cultivation, and those who are diligent and frugal shall flourish.
**Imperial Citation (御疏):** Observe the realm with the method of realm cultivation—when all its people cultivate, diligent and frugal, virtue becomes abundant.

○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Observe the realm that cultivates the Dao with the realm that does not cultivate the Dao.

Observe the world with the world.
**Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe the world with the world’s method, and those who act without action shall attain universality.
**Imperial Citation (御疏):** What is there left to observe when observing the world with the world? Simply observe oneself. When a sovereign is pure, acts without action, and establishes and embraces the Dao, the people naturally gather, and the realm’s longevity is assured.

○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Observe the sovereign who cultivates the Dao with the sovereign who does not cultivate the Dao.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this [standard].

**Imperial Commentary (御注):** Observe oneself and others with this standard, and it shall be known.
**Imperial Citation (御疏):** This is a rhetorical question. The Old Master asks: How do I know that establishing and embracing the Dao leads to unshakable prosperity and enduring virtue? By observing oneself and others with this standard—from the self outward to the realm—it shall be known. Thus, the *Yijing* says: *"Observe my life"* and *"Observe its life,"* meaning one must first observe oneself before observing others.

○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** The Old Master speaks of how I know that those who cultivate the Dao prosper, while those who abandon it perish—by observing these five [aspects], it is known.

○ **Honor [Rong] said:** How does one know that cultivators prosper and non-cultivators perish? Observe one body, and a hundred bodies may be known; observe one realm, and ten thousand realms become evident—how much more so the Three Dynasties?

**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Chapter on Abundant Virtue**
This chapter follows the previous because the prior elucidates cultivating the Dao for the benefit of others, embodying the Dao and uniting with the True. Thus, this chapter returns to describe such a person as one of abundant virtue.

Within this chapter, the meaning is divided into four parts:
1. The infant as metaphor, showing the absence of the Three Poisons.
2. The embodiment of the Dao in emptiness and forgetfulness, thus the Three Activities are pure.
3. Praising the virtuous and abundant, knowing harmony and constancy.
4. Contrasting those who cling to the mind, whose actions defy the Dao.

---
**First: The infant as metaphor, showing the absence of the Three Poisons.**

The Dao-heart is subtle, abundant virtue is profound—like the love for an infant.
First, the account of Zhou Yu’s abandonment, the survival of Wu Tu, and the ancient saying of the Chu people.
His sinews and bones are frail, yet he holds harmonious *qi* without action,
Unknowing of male and female, guarding the yielding and soft to fortify himself.
Upright and detached from the world, carefree and beyond dust,
His form hides in humble dwellings, yet his mind soars above the blue clouds.
Could he be like Yi You in declining office, or Guangcheng Zi in refusing the lord?
He hears thunder yet hears nothing, sees Tai Mountain yet sees nothing—
His eyes are closed in boundless freedom, his steps unconstrained.
This is the highest sage’s cultivation, the infant’s true attainment.

Abundant virtue is like that of the infant.
**Imperial Commentary (御注):** The Perfect One who harbors profound virtue and the Dao is like the infant.
**Imperial Citation (御疏):** *Contain* means to harbor. The Perfect One, harboring deep virtue and the Dao, is internally protected by virtue and externally guarded by the numinous—like a mother’s care for her infant. This truth is difficult to grasp, hence the metaphor.

Thus, the infant’s wholeness and harmony are used to illustrate the Perfect One’s complete virtue.
The infant, the smallest of children, is taken as an example because within, there is no distinction, and no heart to harm others.

○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Abundant virtue refers to one who harbors profound virtue and the Dao, like the infant—divine protection surrounds those who contain virtue, as parents do for their child.

○ **Honor [Rong] said:** Harboring the Dao and embracing virtue, accumulating deep and sincere actions, *qi* focused and unyielding, desires extinguished and without greed, the True Child undispersed—like the infant.

○ **Citation of Cheng [成疏]:** Harboring virtue and the Dao is supremely pure; to illustrate this, the infant is compared.
The infant’s conduct is detailed below:

Poisonous creatures do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not attack,
Hawks do not snatch.

**Imperial Commentary (御注):** The Perfect One is divine—harm cannot touch them. Since there is no heart to harm others, there is no ground for stinging or seizing. This is the Perfect One’s abundant virtue.

**Imperial Citation (御疏):** This elucidates the Perfect One’s complete virtue.
Poisonous creatures: bees and wasps.
Fierce beasts: tigers and rhinos.
Hawks: falcons and sparrowhawks.
*Sting*: using the tail’s venomous end.
*Attack*: pressing with the feet.
*Snatch*: seizing with claws.
The Perfect One’s virtue is complete within, harmonious *qi* overflows, the heart merges with the Dao—thus, venomous creatures cannot sting, fierce beasts cannot attack, and hawks cannot snatch. This arises from their utmost conformity to virtue’s depth.

○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Poisonous creatures do not sting—bees, wasps, snakes, and *qi* do not sting. Fierce beasts do not attack, hawks do not snatch—the infant harms no thing, and things harm no infant. Thus, in the Age of Great Peace, people of all ranks possess benevolence; creatures with barbs revert to their nature, and venomous beasts do not harm humans.

「○ **Rong said:** When venomous creatures strike, it is called *sting* (螫); when fierce beasts press with their feet, it is called *attack* (据); when hawks seize with their claws, it is called *snatch* (搏). The reason infants cause no harm is twofold: first, they lack inner poisonous intent; second, their tender hearts are shielded by maternal kindness, so they are not injured.

Those who embody *virtue/power* (德) neither possess malicious intent nor allow venomous creatures to unleash their venom, nor do fierce beasts find means to attack. This is because their hearts are pure and the Dao’s blessings descend to protect them.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** Venomous creatures refer to snakes and *qi*-beasts (虺). Hawks (获乌) include falcons and sparrowhawks (鹰鹯). Fierce beasts (猛兽) are rhinos and tigers (兕虎). *Sting* (螫) means to deploy venom. *Snatch* (搏) means to strike or grasp. Infants do not violate the realm of the *Dao* before them, hence they are not harmed by these three creatures—this illustrates how those who embody *virtue/power* transcend the three poisons (三毒) without obstruction.

The second passage explains how the *Dao* achieves emptiness and forgetfulness, thus purifying the three *actions* (三业). Their bones are weak, their sinews soft, yet their grasp is firm.

○ **Yuzhu’s commentary:** Weak bones and soft sinews yet firm grasp—before they comprehend the union of *yin* (雌/牝) and *yang* (雄/牡), their vital *qi* (□) surges unceasingly. This is the utmost refinement of *essence* (精), and they cry all day without hoarseness, achieving perfect harmony.

Infants, though weak in bones and sinews, can clench their fists with unyielding strength. Before they know the interplay of *yin* and *yang*, the source of their vital *qi* (□) moves naturally, as pure as the essence itself. They cry ceaselessly from morning to night yet their voices remain unbroken—this is the peak of unspoiled harmony, the infant’s complete attunement.

○ **Yuzhu’s commentary (continued):** This section further elucidates the infant’s perfect harmony. Though their sinews and bones are frail, their grasp over objects is inexplicably firm—is this not due to their harmonious *qi* never dispersing?

○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Infants, with weak sinews and bones, yet grasp objects firmly, do so because their focus is unshaken and their hearts do not stray.

○ **Rong said:** Infants’ firm grasp of their thumbs with weak sinews and bones is not from strength but from the concentration of their hearts. Though others may attempt to pry open their fists, they cannot. Those who embody *virtue/power* bend their bodies to conform to things and soften their hearts to follow the *Dao*. Though others may desire to sway them, they remain unopened—this is the natural preservation of *True Reality* (全真).

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** It speaks of infants with weak sinews and bones yet firm hands, likening those who embody *virtue/power* to beings of gentle nature, compliant and harmonious. Though they mingle with the world, their inner purity remains untouched—whether stained or not, they hold fast. This illustrates the purity of their *intentional actions* (意业).

Before they comprehend the union of *yin* (牝) and *yang* (牡), their vital *qi* (□) surges. Yuzhu’s commentary explains: *Yin* is the feminine (雌), *yang* is the masculine (雄), and □ refers to the source of life *qi*. Though infants do not yet understand the union of *yin* and *yang*, their vital *qi* (□) moves naturally—is this not from the utmost concentration of their *essence* (精)?

○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Infants, unaware of the union of male and female, yet their *yin* (阴) surges with anger—this arises from their abundance of *essence* (精).

○ **Rong said:** The union of *yin* and *yang* (牝牡) is the convergence of *yin* and *yang* (阴阳). □ (作) means the infant’s *yin* (童儿阴) moves. *Anger* (怒) here means *stirring* (动). Though infants do not yet grasp the rites of male and female, their *yin* (阴) stirs—this is the utmost refinement of *essence* (精), which does not disperse. When *essence* scatters, the body withers; when the body withers, life ends.

Those who embody *virtue/power* reject external passions yet cherish their *essence*, abandon laborious exertions and treasure their *qi*. They have no intent to stir, yet stirring does not disrupt their stillness. They empty themselves in stillness, yet stillness does not hinder their movement. Stillness does not impede movement—though they move, it is not true movement. Movement does not disrupt stillness—though they are still, it is not true stillness. Movement without hindering stillness is the utmost refinement of *essence*.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** The *Zilin* (字林) states: □ (作) refers to the infant’s *yin* (小儿阴). It speaks of infants, newly born, not yet understanding the union of *yin* and *yang*, yet their *yin* (阴) constantly stirs—this is due to their *essence* and *qi* (精炁) being full and undispersed. Moreover, those who embody *virtue/power* and align with the *Dao*’s pure harmony, practicing *wuwei* (無為) and emptiness, yet still propagate teachings in the world, listening to sounds and seeing forms while intuitively grasping the truth of *emptiness* (真空), do not perceive the union of *yin* and *yang*—this is the utmost refinement of *essence*, illustrating the purity of their *physical actions* (身业).

They cry all day without hoarseness—this is the peak of harmony.

○ **Yuzhu’s commentary:** *Hoarseness* (嗄) means a voice broken by strain. Infants cry from dawn till dusk yet their voices remain unbroken—is this not from their harmonious *qi* being utterly pure?

○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** Infants, from morning till evening, cry without their voices changing—this arises from their abundance of harmonious *qi*.

○ **Rong said:** When crying reaches its extreme without sound, it is called *hoarseness* (嗄). Infants cry constantly from morning to night yet their voices do not grow hoarse—this is because their harmonious *qi* has not yet dispersed. Those who embody *virtue/power* expound profound truths without fatigue, and their teachings flow endlessly without cessation—this too is from their attunement to harmonious *qi*.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** It speaks of infants crying all day without hoarseness—this is because they cry without intent, their harmonious *qi* undispersed. Those who embody *virtue/power* and intuitively grasp the *Dao*’s essence can thus speak of the unspeakable. Though they employ all things, they do not contradict the principle of *no speech* (無言)—this illustrates the purity of their *verbal actions* (口业).

The third passage praises the beauty of embodying *virtue/power*, knowing harmony and abiding in constancy.

Knowing harmony is called *constancy* (常).
○ **Yuzhu’s annotation:** To remain steadfast in harmony and gentleness, like an infant, is the practice of knowing *constancy* (常).

○ **Yuzhu’s commentary:** This concludes the infant’s attunement to utterly pure harmonious *qi*, which does not fail, as a lesson for others. If one can, like an infant, know the principle of harmony and gentleness, and practice it without deviation, this is called the practice of *True Constancy* (真常).

○ **Master of the Riverbank said:** If one knows that the gentle and weak harmonious *qi* is beneficial, then they understand the *Dao*’s constancy.

○ **Rong said:** Knowing harmony is called *constancy* (常); knowing *constancy* is called *clarity* (明). The loss of *essence* and depletion of *qi* leads to *non-constancy* (無常). To know harmony is to preserve *constancy* and avoid death. Those who embody *virtue/power* not only know the principle of harmony but also grasp the meaning of *constancy*—all things are illuminated, hence it is called *clarity*.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:** *Knowing this is non-speech*—those who do not speak are those who embody pure harmony’s principle. To know the *Dao*’s constancy is to abide in *True Constancy*’s path (真常之常道).」

「Knowing *constancy* is called *clarity*. The Master’s annotation: To guard harmony and know *constancy* is to attain *clarity* and understanding.

The Master’s commentary: If one can embody *True Constancy*’s practice and preserve *essence* while cherishing *qi*, then they attain *clarity* and insight.

Those who awaken to understanding know harmony and *constancy*, marveling at the beauty of shared *virtue/power*, yet further harm life by forcing *qi*. They commit the error of abandoning the *Dao* and instead magnify the faults of those who stray.

The Master of the Riverbank said: If one can embody the *Dao*’s *constancy*, then they daily attain *clarity* and insight into the profound mysteries.

The Master Cheng’s commentary: To know *True Constancy*’s *Dao* is to attain wisdom that illuminates *clarity*.

**The fourth couplet reveals the error of fixated intent, actions contrary to the *Dao*.**
To force *qi* for longevity is ill-fated.
The Master’s annotation: *Longevity* (祥) refers to auspicious or inauspicious omens. If one does not know how to guard *constancy* but instead seeks excessive *qi* for life, they invite ruin—this is inauspicious.

The Master’s commentary: *Longevity* (祥) refers to auspicious or inauspicious omens. If one cannot fully harmonize with *constancy* but instead cultivates *qi* beyond measure, they fail to realize that such excess only depletes *essence* and *qi* further. Thus, forcing *qi* for longevity is an inauspicious omen.

The *Zhuangzi* states: *"Longevity arises from following Nature, yet do not force *qi* for life."*

The Master of the Riverbank said: *Longevity* (祥) means "growth." To force *qi* for life is to seek endless growth, which is futile.

Rong said: *Forcing qi for longevity* (益生日祥) means the mind compels *qi* to grow stronger. *Longevity* (祥) is "good," while *strong* (强) means "excessive." This reveals those who follow worldly teachings and cannot emulate the infant’s natural grasp or embody the *virtue/power* of harmony. Those who claim to know harmony yet pursue *qi* through indulgence or medicinal means—seeking to make *qi* excessive and never decline, to maintain goodness without corruption—can they truly succeed?

Hence it is said: *"All know what is good, yet none understand what is not good."*

The Master Cheng’s commentary: *Longevity* (祥) means "abundance." Ordinary people do not grasp the *Dao* of life and death, greedily clinging to worldly gains, and excessively forcing *qi* for life—thus their afflictions and hindrances grow ever broader day by day.

*The mind compels qi to grow stronger.*
The Master’s annotation: The mind has distinctions of right and wrong, while *qi* has none. If one enslaves the mind to force *qi*, they become a person of excessive rigidity.

The Master’s commentary: The mind holds distinctions of right and wrong, yet *qi* itself does not. Thus, yielding to *qi* brings softness and weakness, while forcing the mind leads to rigidity and excess. Those who abandon the *Dao* and force *qi* for life enslave the mind to compel *qi*, making *qi* serve the mind’s will—this is excessive rigidity. Hence the *Zhuangzi* says: *"Do not listen with the mind, but listen with the *qi*."*

The Master of the Riverbank said: The mind should be singularly focused on harmony and softness, while the *qi* remains inwardly settled. Yet those who act recklessly disrupt this balance, and the harmonious *qi* departs from within, causing their form to grow rigid and strong day by day.

The Master Cheng’s commentary: The mind is the *spirit* (神), and *qi* is the body (身). The world’s emotions are inverted, and confusion arises from mistaken perceptions. How could they know that all phenomena are empty, or recognize that the self is but an illusion? Once they enslave the *spirit* to command the body, driving it through ceaseless labor, their karmic bond to birth and death grows ever more potent.

When things reach their peak, they age—this is called *not the Dao*. *Not the Dao* brings early decline.
The Master’s annotation: All things, when at their height, must decay. Thus it is warned: *"To boast of strength and rely on vigor is to go against the *Dao*—this should be stopped early."*

The Master’s commentary: This reveals the error of excessive rigidity and deviation from the *Dao*. *Vigor* (壮) means "unyielding strength," while *aging* (老) means "decay and exhaustion." All things that flourish must decline, and when vigor reaches its extreme, aging follows. Those who use the mind to force *qi* and boast of their strength only hasten their own decay. To call this *not the Dao* is correct, for the *Dao* values softness and weakness, yet these people rely on rigidity—contrary to the *Dao*—and thus are urged to cease early.

The Master of the Riverbank said: *When things reach their peak, they age*—all things, when at their height, wither and grow old. *Not the Dao*—those who age cannot attain the *Dao*. *Not attaining the Dao brings early decline*—those who do not attain the *Dao* die early.

Rong said: *Things reach their peak, they reverse*—when vigor is at its extreme, decay follows. This is the eternal burden of worldly attachment; how could they comprehend the *Dao* of emptiness and tranquility?

The *Venerable Lord* (老君) laments that sentient beings have yet to awaken to *constancy*, to cherish *qi*, and instead cling to worldly actions that force *qi* for life. Such forcing only brings harm, as it contradicts supreme truth. Thus he warns: *"Cease early."*

The Master Cheng’s commentary: *When things reach their peak, they age*—this is called *not the Dao*. All things that flourish must decline, and when vigor reaches its extreme, aging follows. This proves that forcing *qi* for life only confirms *non-constancy*. Since it is *non-constancy*, it cannot be the true *Dao*. *Not the Dao brings early decline*—*decline* (已) means "to stop." If one can awaken and recognize that *non-constancy* is not the true *Dao*, they should cease early and not indulge in false practices.

**Chapter Fifty-Six: "The Silent Sage"**
The reason this chapter follows the previous is that the prior one illuminated how the *virtue/power*-embodied one attains *constancy*, while forcing *qi* for life deviates from the *Dao*. Thus, this chapter follows, revealing how the *virtue/power*-embodied one forgets speech, while those who force *qi* cling to teachings.

This chapter unfolds in four distinct teachings:
1. It reveals the supreme *Dao* as empty and tranquil, transcending all names and words;
2. It reveals the cessation of the mind’s fixations and gradual cultivation through stages;
3. It aligns with worldly confusion yet corresponds to the *Dao*’s natural unfolding;
4. It reveals the profound insight of those who defy convention and follow the *Dao*’s path, thus attaining eminence.

**1. The supreme *Dao* is empty and tranquil, beyond all names and words.**
The Creator acts through effortless, heartless self-motion.
The Sage embodies *virtue/power* to complete the Great.
Confucius’ words, though three feet long, were not profound.
The *Venerable Lord*’s heart serves the people as its master.

The celestial path is distant, yet one hears only the clamor of roosters and dogs.
The journey is boundless, yet only the sound of pipes and drums is heard.

The form is indistinct, speech cannot be known—
thus Zhang Hua, though attending to the *Dao*, found it exhausting,
and Sun Lin, though speaking of *Zhuangzi*’s teachings, could not harmonize them.

To speak is to deviate from the *Dao*;
to act is to lose *True Constancy*.
Li Lou sought pearls yet dove deeper into darkness,
while Yi You played with pills and freed himself.

The *Venerable Lord*’s instruction seals the mouth and closes the gate:
*"The Sage does not speak*—there is good reason for this.»

The Sage knows without speaking, yet the speaker knows not.
*Venerable Lord*’s **Commentary**: Know, to perceive with enlightenment. Speak, to expound in words.
*Venerable Lord*’s **Exegesis**: The Sage, one who perceives with enlightenment. The speaker, one who expounds in words.
The subtlest truths are profound, the **Mysterious Origin** concealed in depth.
Though words are used to elucidate the Way, the Way transcends all speech—
thus the enlightened attain the truth yet forget the words,
while the expounders cling to words yet fail to comprehend.

Therefore it is said:
*"The Sage knows without speaking, the speaker knows not."*

**Master He Shang** said:
*"The Sage knows without speaking—
his worth lies in action, not in words.
The speaker knows not—
a horse cannot outrun its tongue;*
*many words bring many calamities."*

**Master Rong** said:
*"The Sage knows without speaking—
attaining the essence, he forgets all teaching.
The speaker knows not—
too many words betray the Way,
and clinging to doctrine loses True Constancy."*

**Master Cheng**’s **Exegesis** said:
*"The Sage knows without speaking—
those who grasp the Way,
reach the subtle truths,
and know the principles beyond words,
thus they do not speak.
Hence *Zhuangzi* says:
‘The Dao has no questions,
questions have no answers—
this is called *wuwei* [non-action].’

The speaker knows not—
he is ensnared by mere words,
seeking truth in speech alone,
yet the Way surpasses all linguistic symbols,
thus he knows not.
Hence *Zhuangzi* says:
‘Those who ask of the Dao and answer it,
do not comprehend the Dao.
Comprehending the Dao is the province of the Yellow Emperor.’*

---

**Third**, it clarifies that **True Constancy** has no attachment—
gradually cultivating, step by step.
Seal its **mouth** [兑], close its **gate** [门].
*Venerable Lord*’s **Commentary**: Seal its **mouth**—
the enlightened, regarding the law, harbor no affection or clinging,
thus it is said to seal its **mouth**.
Close its **gate**—
once free from affection,
the door of craving for praise is shut.

*Venerable Lord*’s **Exegesis**:
As explained in the chapter *"The Beginning of the World"*, yet here it is concisely stated:
to seal the six senses from love and desire,
to close the door of speech and doctrine,
and thus to ease the burden of clinging words.

To have no attachment to words,
thus it is said to seal its **mouth**—
not being swayed by praise or blame,
this is called closing its **gate**.

**Master He Shang** said:
*"To seal and close is to cut off its source."*

**Master Rong** said:
*"To block the path of desire,
and sever the root of calamity."*

**Master Cheng**’s **Exegesis** said:
*"Seal its **mouth**—
to silence speech and argument.
Close its **gate**—
to restrain the six emotions.
Dull its sharpness,
resolve its chaos,
soften its brilliance,
blend with the dust.*

*Venerable Lord*’s **Commentary**:
As explained in the chapter *"The Overflowing of the Dao"*,
yet here it is applied to human conduct.
To say one can embody the Dao,
this is called harmonizing with the **Mysterious Origin**’s virtue.

*Venerable Lord*’s **Exegesis**:
These four lines already appear in the upper passage of the *"Overflowing of the Dao"* chapter,
yet there it discusses the Dao’s function,
while here it illustrates human practice.
The two passages together,
repeating these lines,
emphasize the Dao’s role in benefiting others and perfecting oneself.

**Master He Shang** said:
*"Dull its sharpness—
when desire and emotion grow sharp,
one should reflect on the Dao’s non-action to temper them.
Resolve its chaos—
when anger and grudges swirl without end,
one should reflect on the Dao’s tranquility to dispel them.
Soften its brilliance—
though one may possess singular insight,
one should blend it with the dim,
so as not to dazzle others.
Blend with the dust—
one should not stand apart as unique."*

**Master Rong** said:
*"Dull its sharpness, resolve its chaos—
to blunt the edge of greed,
and to release the tangled disputes of right and wrong.
Soften its brilliance, blend with the dust—
this is called harmonizing with the **Mysterious Origin**,
for in the contest of gain and loss,
one may succeed or fail,
and in the rivalry of right and wrong,
there is only one side or the other.
Now, to soften brilliance is to share in wisdom without distinction,
and to blend with the dust is to unite in folly without separation,
to traverse all things in equal measure—
what law could then divide us?"*

**Master Cheng**’s **Exegesis**:
*"Dull its sharpness—
to curb greed and rivalry.
Resolve its chaos—
to release resentment and forgiveness.
Soften its brilliance—
to accommodate the vulgar and unlearned.
Blend with the dust—
to merge with worldly affairs.
The preceding lines have already been fully elucidated;
now they are simply reiterated without further expounding.
They are repeated because these lines are most pertinent to study and inquiry."*

---

**Fourth**, it explains blending with the dust and obscuring one’s traces,
thus aligning with the Way—
this is called **harmonizing with the Mysterious Origin**.

*Venerable Lord*’s **Exegesis**:
It praises those who embody the Dao—
not clinging to words or doctrine,
and blending their brilliance with the common,
their conduct in resonance with the Way—
this is called **harmonizing with the Mysterious Origin**’s virtue.

**Master He Shang** said:
*"Mysterious, the heavens.
If one can practice these matters above,
it is called aligning with the heavenly Dao."*

**Master Cheng**’s **Exegesis** said:
*"Having first severed attachment to self,
then blending brilliance and obscuring traces,
one’s virtue is full and complete,
thus their conduct aligns with the **Mysterious Origin**’s principles."*

---

**Fifth**, it reveals the Sage’s profound understanding of yielding and compliance,
thus his exalted dignity.
Hence, he cannot be approached with familiarity,
nor distanced with coldness.

*Venerable Lord*’s **Commentary**:
*"Hence, he cannot be approached with familiarity—
the **Mysterious Origin**’s harmony knows no partiality,
thus he cannot be approached with familiarity.
He cannot be distanced with coldness—
his boundless blending with all,
thus he cannot be distanced with coldness."*

*Venerable Lord*’s **Exegesis**:
*"The Sage who harmonizes with the **Mysterious Origin**,
whose heart holds no bias,
cannot be approached with familiarity,
nor treated with levity.
He blends his brilliance and follows things,
cannot be distanced with coldness,
nor held at arm’s length."*

**Master He Shang** said:
*"Hence, he cannot be approached with familiarity—
he does not take pleasure in honor and fame,
nor sorrow in solitude.
He cannot be distanced with coldness—
his mind is tranquil, his desires stilled,
he bears no grudge against others."*

**Master Rong** said:
*"Hence, he cannot be approached with familiarity,
nor distanced with coldness,
nor drawn by profit,
nor hindered by harm,
nor elevated by nobility,
nor diminished by lowliness—
thus he is noble in the world.
For near and far bring distinctions of familiarity and distance,
and holding onto gain and loss spawns profit and harm,
while fixing rank and status solidifies nobility and lowliness.
Now, having resolved chaos and dulled sharpness,
blended brilliance and united with the dust,
his love and hate are equal,
familiarity and distance cannot penetrate him,
praise and blame are the same,
profit and harm cannot interfere,
honor and disgrace are forgotten—
nobility and lowliness cannot be attained.
Those who can practice this,
may be called noble in the world."*

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*"The Dao aligns with the Profound Mystery,
while perception transcends duality—
both subject and object forgotten,
and yet one gaze encompasses near and far.
He cannot be exploited for gain,
nor harmed by conflict.
**Master Guo’s Annotation:**
*'Cannot be exploited for gain'—
for without desire, gain cannot be seized.
'Cannot be harmed by conflict'—
for without strife, harm cannot be inflicted.*

**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**
*In tranquil simplicity, none can lure him with profit,
and dwelling in non-competition, none can provoke him to harm.*

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
*'Cannot be exploited for gain'—
his body does not crave wealth and rank,
his palate does not indulge in the five flavors.
Nor can he be harmed—
he does not contend with the greedy for profit,
nor does he clash with the bold for vigor.*

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Gain and harm are but matters of life and death.
To him, life and death bring no change—
how much less profit and loss!
Thus the *Zhuangzi* says:
*'He does not pursue gain,
nor shun harm.'*

He cannot be ennobled,
nor debased.
**Master Guo’s Annotation:**
*'Cannot be ennobled'—
embodying the Dao naturally, he cannot be forced into nobility.
'Cannot be debased'—
pure as washed jade, he cannot be sullied.*

**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**
*Embodying the Dao naturally,
he is not adorned by rank or office,
transcending entanglements,
beyond the reach of common defilement.*

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
*'Cannot be ennobled'—
he does not rule in chaotic times,
nor occupy a tyrant’s throne.
Nor can he be debased—
he does not grow arrogant from power,
nor bow from broken resolve.*

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Nobility and lowliness are but matters of praise and blame—
thus slander and acclaim move him not,
honor and disgrace stir him not.
Hence, nobility and lowliness cannot touch his heart.
Thus, he is noble in the world.*

**Master Guo’s Annotation:**
*His essence is unobstructed, his speech unconstrained,
all sharpness dissolved, brilliance blended with dust—
near and far cannot reach him,
nobility and lowliness cannot be imposed.*

**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**
*Those who merge with the Profound Mystery
awaken to truth beyond words,
seal their senses, close their gates,
untainted by roots or dust.
With all sharpness dissolved and brilliance obscured,
their conduct is thus—
and so the world reveres them as noble.*

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
*His virtue is such that
emperors cannot make him a subject,
lords cannot bend him—
he drifts with the world’s tides,
preserving himself while avoiding harm.
Thus, he is noble in the world.*

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Having cast off distinctions of near and far,
and forgotten gain and loss,
praise and blame do not enter his mind,
nobility and lowliness do not weigh on his heart.
Thus, the common folk bear him aloft without complaint,
all ranks extol him without exhaustion—
and so the world between heaven and earth honors and esteems him.*

---
**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing with the Dao**
*(This chapter follows the previous one,
which illuminated those who embody the Dao as the world’s most noble—
now it demonstrates how such sages govern,
to show the method of ruling and transforming.)*

The chapter unfolds in four distinct sections:
1. **Discerning the two wisdoms—power and reality—and their differing applications.**
2. **Nurturing the people without first creating disorder.**
3. **Addressing doubts through hypothetical questions to expound on action.**
4. **Citing sages to reveal the beauty of non-action.**

---
**1. Discerning the two wisdoms—power and reality—and their differing applications.**

*The Dao is the hidden essence of all things,
while war is the toil of the people.
Thus, the sage-kings of antiquity melted down weapons
to forge farming tools.
Later ages, lost in delusion, wielded axes and halberds
as instruments of threat and punishment.
Hence, war relies on deceit and surprise,
while the Dao rests in profound silence.
The man of empty heart and full belly
retires like Ziyin to the recluses of Huan Liang,
while the ambitious, reckless warrior
meets his end like Nie Zheng at the hands of the Chancellor of Qin—
one is ridiculed as a flayed fool across the world,
the other revered as a model of loyalty in the age.
With rulers abounding in taboos,
the people grow impoverished,
and strange devices multiply,
only breeding more thieves and bandits.

The sage does nothing, yet all things find rest.
The man who harbors the Dao must know this truth.*

---
**Governing with the Dao,**
**Master Guo’s Annotation:**
*'Governing with the Dao'—
using deceit in war,
using non-action to win the world.
*'Win' here means to harmonize.
To rule the world, the highest virtue is non-action.
If one governs through laws and policies,
or wages war with deceit,
these are all misalignments.
Only non-action and non-governing can win the world.*

**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**
*Here is the heading.
*'With' means 'by means of.'
*'Politics' refers to governance and education.
It says that a ruler who acts will boast of his policies,
yet cannot achieve non-action,
and cannot let things transform naturally.
To seek governance through policies—
this has never been heard before.*

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
*'With' means 'to attain.'
Heaven appoints those who rectify themselves
to rectify the realm.*

**Master Yan** said:
*Striving to govern with public-minded thought
is not as good as governing without thought at all.
To forbid excess by desire
is not as good as attaining loyalty through no desire.
To grasp the strategies of Huangdi and Taigong,
and wield the essentials of Sunzi and Wuqi,
is not as good as letting the world abandon schemes of cunning.*

**Master Rong** said:
*Nurturing the people lies in balance,
spreading virtue in governance lies in rectitude.
This is what is meant by:
*'The feudal lords and ministers cultivate morality,
harmonizing rites and culture in education.'*

**Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
*'With' means 'by means of.'
*'Politics' refers to named laws and statutes.
*'Govern' means to regulate and order.
The sage, ruling the world,
adapts to circumstances in dealing with people,
employing the Dao’s power in war,
and applying practical wisdom in governance—
this is the time to lay down arms and cultivate culture,
to use substantive governance.*

---
**Using deceit in war,**
**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**
*This is also a heading.
*'Deceit' means stratagem and trickery.
Unauspicious tools—
the virtuous man already abhors them.
How much more so when paired with deceitful names
and unrestrained application!
Thus, war is like fire—
if not controlled, it will consume itself.
Hence, it is known that deceitful warfare
is not the path to victory.*

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
*'Deceit' means 'trickery.'*

The Celestial employs deceitful and false men
to wield arms.

**Master Rong** said:
*‘Deceit’ means stratagem and trickery—
in times of crisis, one must adapt with cunning.
War knows no surfeit of deceit:
the *Three Stratagems* are most cunning,
the *Nine Battles* ensure victory a hundred times.
The supreme general pacifies strife and quells rebels—
this is the martial virtue’s achievement.*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*‘Deceit’ means guile and trickery.
To subdue chaos and restore order,
one must wield arms—
war knows no surfeit of deceit,
requiring guile and cunning.
Thus, it is the age of abandoning culture for martial prowess,
of employing expedient power.*

Secondly, to govern the people,
nothing surpasses *wu shi* [non-action].
To attain the realm through *wu shi*.
**Master Guo’s Exegesis:**
*This is also a heading.
The sagely ruler acts without action yet brings order—
to act without action is to have no affairs,
to have no affairs is to avoid exertion,
to avoid exertion is for the people to self-transform,
and thus the realm attains great peace.*

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
*To employ those who act without action,
to rule the realm as its sovereign.*

**Master Rong** said:
*The enlightened ruler governs the realm:
when expounding the Dao and propagating virtue,
he has worthy ministers;
when upholding principles and punishing rebellion,
he has renowned generals.
Seated in majesty among the myriad states,
his ears sealed, his spirit concentrated in the highest halls.*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*The Way of culture and martial arts adapts to circumstances and times—
like the linked huts of a military encampment,
which rely on straw dogs for sacrifice:
to grasp them tightly only worsens their decay.
Better to act without action, concentrate the spirit within the *Gushaji* [mythical realm],
neither martial nor cultural,
to rule from the ancestral hall with passive governance,
thus transforming all things—
no flaws or ailments remain.
To govern the people in this way,
they sing and strike the earth in joy.
The subtlety of this governance lies here.*

Thirdly, posing doubts and widely debating *youwei* [action].
*How do I know this is so?*

「以此。
**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
The Sage Master, in his questioning, inquires: *"How do I know that to govern the world must be without action and without affairs?"*
By observing the following lines, one may verify: *"The more prohibitions there are, the poorer the people grow."* I, without action, let the people transform themselves naturally—
thus it is proven.

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
*"This"* refers to *"today."* The Master Lao speaks of how I know the will of Heaven,
by what is seen in today’s affairs.

**Master Rong** said:
*"How do one know that without affairs one can govern the world?"*
By these lines below: *"I, without affairs, let the people enrich themselves naturally."*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
The Sage Master’s teaching poses this question:
*"How do I know that to transform and govern the world must be without affairs?"*
By examining the lines that follow, one understands.
The world abounds with prohibitions and taboos,
yet the people grow ever poorer.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
When governing with laws and decrees,
prohibitions multiply—
people lose their means of livelihood,
thus they grow ever poorer.

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
*"The world"* refers to the sovereign.
*"Prohibitions"* mean restrictions.
If the sovereign indulges in excessive restrictions,
deceit arises within the people.
If prohibitions are many,
the lower ranks resort to trickery,
and deceit spreads among them—
thus poverty ensues.

**Master Rong** said:
Prohibitions are manifold,
laws and decrees form a dense net—
the net ensnares, the people labor,
its strictness instills fear—
how can they not grow poor,
when laws obstruct their livelihood?

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*"Prohibitions"* are akin to *"restrictions and punishments."*
Harsh laws and punishments ensnare many,
the people dare not pursue their livelihoods—
thus they grow ever poorer.
Those who govern themselves cannot follow their true nature,
but cling rigidly to restrictions and taboos,
lacking inner virtue—
thus they grow ever poorer.
This sentence elucidates governance through laws.

The people abound with sharp implements,
yet the state grows ever more chaotic.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*"Sharp implements"* refer to *"stratagems and deceits."*
If the sovereign relies excessively on stratagems and deceits,
and cannot discern true simplicity,
then the lower ranks will respond in kind with cunning and guile—
thus the state grows ever more chaotic and disordered.

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
*"Sharp implements"* are stratagems.
If the people are steeped in stratagems,
their vision is dazzled, their hearing bewildered—
superior and inferior grow estranged,
thus the state falls into chaos.

**Master Rong** said:
Stratagems and power should not be given in excess to the people,
weapons should not be common in every household—
if weapons are common, people will think of rebellion,
if many hold power, fear of disorder arises.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*"Sharp implements"* means *"weapons of war."*
*"Hastening"* means *"excessive."*
In an age of chaos and disorder,
culture and virtue are neglected,
only warfare is pursued—
as injuries and devastation multiply,
the chaos deepens daily.
Those who govern themselves sharpen their desires,
their minds and spirits grow corrupted—
this sentence further elucidates the use of arms.

The people abound in clever schemes,
strange devices proliferate.

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
*"The people"* refers to the sovereign and his lords within a hundred-li territory.
If they indulge in clever schemes,
engraving palaces and embroidering garments,
strange devices multiply—
the lower ranks will emulate their excesses,
adorned in gold and jade,
with dyed silks and vibrant hues—
such adornments will proliferate daily.

**Master Rong** said:
Excessive cleverness breeds strange devices,
superiors delight in objects, inferiors kindle desire.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*"Clever"* refers to *"scheming minds."*
*"Strange devices"* are war implements.
If the sovereign favors martial pursuits,
the people must comply—
thus each arises with strange contrivances,
competing to offer clever schemes,
forging war machines and siege engines,
presenting myriad strange devices
to attain great merit.
Those who govern themselves indulge in clever schemes and deceits,
ever greedy for gain,
their discriminating minds
grow ever more corrupt—
this sentence again elucidates the use of arms.

Laws and decrees multiply,
thieves and robbers proliferate.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*"Laws"* refer to *"legal statutes and punishments."*
*"Decrees"* are *"teachings and commands."*
If the sovereign cannot curb his desires to govern the people,
but instead seeks to harmonize all with elaborate laws and decrees,
the people will merely evade punishment without shame,
while officials will exploit the laws for personal gain—
superior and inferior deceive each other,
thus thieves and robbers proliferate.

**Master He Shang Gong** said:
*"Laws"* are *"precious things."*
If the sovereign values and displays precious things,
agricultural labor is abandoned,
hunger and cold ensue—
thus thieves and robbers proliferate.

**Master Rong** said:
Precious things are *"objects of law."*
If gold and jade are highly prized,
thieves and robbers will arise.
It also states that laws, meant to suppress theft, instead breed more thieves,
and rituals, intended to restore order, instead foster greater chaos.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*"Objects of law"* are akin to *"laws and decrees."*
When legal statutes and punishments are prominently displayed,
laws and decrees grow ever more numerous—
cloth woven with fat, armor that cannot be pierced from three sides,
people cannot endure such oppressive measures—
those who flee become many,
and reckless thefts arise—
thus thieves and robbers proliferate.
As the governance grows ever more intricate,
the people’s evasion becomes ever more concealed.
This sentence again elucidates governance through laws.

「The fourth section draws upon the Sage, revealing the beauty of *wuwei* [非作為, "non-action"]. Thus the Sage says: *"I act with non-action, and the people transform themselves;*
*I do no work, and the people grow wealthy;*
*I love tranquility, and the people become upright;*
*I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity."*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*"I act with non-action"*—the Sage speaks of himself, for the Sage’s **virtue/power** [德] does not rely on clever stratagems. He embodies the essence of the Dao/Way, valuing *wuwei* [無為]. *Wuwei* means there is nothing to forbid or restrict; the Sage’s own *wuwei* [無為] allows the people to transform themselves accordingly.

**Master He Shang Gong** [河上公] says: *"Thus the Sage speaks"*—referring to matters below. *"I act with non-action"* means the Sage cultivates the Dao/Way and follows Heaven’s mandate, making no alterations, and yet the people transform themselves.

**Master Rong** [荣] says: The preceding lines warn against four forms of *wei* [作為, "artificial action"]—the maladies of governance. Hence, the Sage prescribes four *wuwei* [無為] remedies to eliminate chaos and achieve transformation, to attain stillness by abandoning movement, to ensure domestic peace and cultural harmony, and to let things unfold naturally so that the people know contentment and grow wealthy, follow the Dao/Way without deviation and return to simplicity by discarding excess.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
The Sage’s **virtue/power** [德] is tranquil and detached, *wuwei* [無為]. Beneath him, the people abandon vice and embrace goodness. The Sage is indeed a Sage, yet he modestly attributes his teachings to other Sages, hence *Zhuangzi* [《莊子》] says: *"My allegories are nineteen in number."* [寓言十九]

*"I do no work, and the people grow wealthy,"*
**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
The Sage’s heart is free from artificial action, and his governance is simple—each of the four classes [四民] pursues their respective occupations, the six directions [六合] aligned in harmony, with lightened burdens and sparse taxation. If not for this, what would make the people wealthy?

*"I love tranquility, and the people become upright,"*
**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
The Sage above embraces stillness, not troubling the people, so they inherit the pure winds of nature and naturally return to the upright path.

*"I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity."*
**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
When the Sage above has few desires and little selfishness, maintains purity and simplicity, the people know contentment and abide by their proper roles, returning to simplicity.

The following lines all elucidate the meaning of *taking the world without action* [無事取天下].

**Chapter 58: "His Governance is Obscure and Obscure"**
The reason this chapter follows the previous one is that the prior chapter expounds upon the Sage who follows the Dao/Way and governs through *wuwei* [無為], while the unrighteous ruler multiplies laws and decrees. Thus, this chapter broadens the discussion: the governance of the Daoist Sage is obscure and effortless, while that of the unrighteous is meticulous and invasive. The meaning flows in continuity, hence its placement.

This chapter is divided into four distinct sections. The first distinguishes between two forms of governance—lenient and harsh—and their differing effects. The second contrasts the two outcomes of governance—calamity and blessing—showing their unpredictability. The third laments the prolonged ignorance of ordinary beings, not limited to this life alone. The fourth illustrates the Sage’s transcendence of merit, concealing his light and brilliance.

**First Section: Distinguishing Lenient and Harsh Governance, Their Different Effects.**
It is said that Yao opened the Four Gates [四門], and the people rejoiced in the *jiren* [擊壤] song of contentment. Qin unified the hundred districts [百郡], yet the nation became a ruin, its people suffering calamity. Thus one knows that governance and teaching lie in simplicity and naturalness—why must they be meticulously enforced? Hence, when Jin Wu became Emperor, he burned the *Zhitou* [雉頭] tax records to restore harmony, and when Shi Qing served as a minister, he counted only the horses to uphold integrity. The Sage’s heart is empty, aligning with the Dao/Way, and even snoring can yield pearls. The rigid ruler loses his life by clinging to his intentions, as Jing Ke did by returning his sword. The outcomes of calamity and blessing—are they not thus determined?

**Lamenting the Prolonged Ignorance of Heaven’s Sentient Beings:**
The days of their delusion are indeed long. The sorrow of hell’s torments, yet their heads still gather there. The joy of heaven’s paradise, yet their hearts depart and do not ascend. Only when they are at their wits’ end do they wag their tails in submission—how wretched is their plight! When suffering comes, they begin to strike their heads in repentance—what use is regret then? Strive to reflect and awaken, and cast off the shackles of this mortal coil!

**His governance is obscure and obscure, his people are pure and pure.**
**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Governance that is obscure and obscure—*wuwei* [無為] and lenient—leads the people to respond with natural purity and simplicity.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Obscure and obscure [闷闷]—lenient and expansive. Pure and pure [淳淳]—simple and sincere. The Sage above governs through *wuwei* [無為], and his policies are lenient and expansive, so the people beneath him follow and become pure and simple.

**His governance is meticulous and meticulous, his people are deficient and deficient.**
**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Governance that is meticulous and meticulous—*wei* [作為] and harsh—leads the people to respond with deficiency and decay.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Meticulous and meticulous [察察]—*wei* [作為] and strict. The governance of the Sage is lenient and expansive, allowing things to unfold naturally. Since there is no cruelty, the people’s customs become pure and simple. His governance is meticulous and invasive, yet the people grow deficient and exhausted.

**缺缺**—decay and dispersion. The ruling lord who acts (*youwei*), whose governance is stern and urgent, who binds people with laws, whose decrees proliferate—then thieves and bandits multiply, and the people wither and scatter.

**River Upper Master** said: His governance is meticulous and urgent—words spoken in haste, ears straining to listen. His people are deficient and deficient—governance is urgent and harsh, the people cannot sustain life, so they grow ever more sparse and thin.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*察察*—stern and swift. *缺缺*—scattered and ruined. The ruler favors action, governs with haste, and the people suffer under his tyranny, thus they scatter.

**On governing oneself**, one should also cultivate emptiness, forgetfulness, and leniency—never clinging to a hasty or rigid heart.

---
**Second: The Two Disciples of Calamity and Fortune—leaning and hidden, without fixed end.**

Calamity! Fortune leans upon it.
Fortune! Calamity hides within it.
Who knows its ultimate measure?

**Imperial Commentary:**
*倚*—rooted in. *伏*—concealed. Earlier, it spoke of lenient governance, yet the people deemed it lacking in order, yet became pure and simple—this is calamity giving rise to fortune. Stern governance, yet the people saw it as virtuous governance unfolding, yet they withered and scattered—this is fortune concealing calamity.

**Imperial Exegesis:**
Calamity! Fortune leans upon it—earlier, it spoke of lenient governance, which the people took as evil, yet they became pure and sincere—how is this not fortune arising from calamity? Fortune! Calamity hides within it—*伏*, concealed. Stern governance, which the people took as good, yet things decayed and scattered—how is this not calamity hidden within fortune, ready to emerge? Who knows its ultimate measure? Those who lose the Dao and abandon virtue, indulging in deceit and superficiality—thus calamity and fortune cycle, leaning and hidden without fixed rule. Who can know their true end?

**River Upper Master** said: Calamity! Fortune leans upon it—*倚*, rooted in. Fortune arises from calamity: when people face calamity and repent, take responsibility, cultivate goodness, and follow the Way, then calamity departs and fortune arrives. Fortune! Calamity hides within it—calamity lurks within fortune. When people obtain fortune yet grow arrogant and licentious, then fortune departs and calamity comes. Who knows its ultimate measure? Calamity and fortune generate each other endlessly; none can fathom their final limit.

**Master Yan** said: Fortune arises from calamity, calamity from fortune. Calamity and fortune, though distinct, share the same root—thus abandoning fortune means no calamity, no calamity means no fortune. Fortune without fortune is the most subtle and profound; none in the world can exhaust its depths.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Calamity! Fortune leans upon it. Fortune! Calamity hides within it. *倚*—rooted in. *伏*—concealed. Lenient governance brings fortune; stern governance invites calamity. These two matters stem from the same heart—fortune leans upon calamity, calamity hides within fortune; their principle is not distant. Who knows its ultimate measure? Its standard is unclear. *孰*—who. The signs of calamity and fortune arise from good and evil; since deeds are unstable, so too are their rewards. Thus they cycle through the Three Realms, return to the Six Paths, in myriad transformations—who can know their end?

Only the superior sage, forgetting self to aid others, embodying this true Dao, awakening to the Profound Mystery—unmoved by the causes of good and evil—thus escapes calamity and fortune’s reach. As *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Calamity does not arrive, fortune does not come.
Calamity and fortune are nonexistent—who would suffer disaster?"*

Thus they turn endlessly without end—because they do not uphold the true Dao.

**Third: Lamenting the long-deluded common folk—this is not merely of this life.**

Is there no true principle?

**Imperial Commentary:**
Is there no true principle? What is true becomes strange; what is good becomes ominous. The extremes of calamity and fortune—is there truly no principle? Yet sentient beings cling to delusion, deeming the true as deceitful, the good as portents of ill—thus calamity and fortune lean and hide, as if no principle exists.

**Imperial Exegesis:**
This speaks of the extremes of calamity and fortune—is there truly no fixed principle? Yet because people cannot embody the Dao of *wuwei*, they generate delusion, losing the true principle.

**River Upper Master** said: *无*—not. The ruler does not rectify himself—then there is no state.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Is there no true principle? What is true becomes strange; what is good becomes ominous. *奇*—strange, *妖*—evil. The deeds of good and evil returning—this is all as it should be. The silent, solitary true principle alone is true. Most accumulate filth, few have purity—thus it is said there is no true principle. Those who follow evil are many; those who follow the true are few. Even if one acts rightly, the true is not always true—suddenly it shifts, thus it is called strange. All commit evil, unwilling to do good—even if one acts well, goodness does not endure, soon returning to evil, thus it is called ominous. What is true becomes strange; what is good becomes ominous.

**Imperial Exegesis:**
This explains the source of deluded principle. Sentient beings are confused about the true principle of calamity and fortune—unaware of the true, they deem it deceitful; unenlightened to goodness, they call it an omen. Thus it seems as if there is no true principle.

**River Upper Master** said: What is true becomes strange—*奇*, deceit. The ruler does not rectify himself; though the people below may act rightly, they in turn corrupt the ruler’s sincerity.

「善复为妖，善人皆复化上为妖祥也。」
Even the virtuous are transformed into omens of ill fortune—all are made to corrupt the ruler’s sincerity through their own goodness.

「○成疏：正复为奇，奇，虚诈也。」
**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** What is true becomes strange—*奇*, deceit. The very essence of deceit.

「假使有心学於正道者，则执正为正，未解忘遣，不与实性相应，故为虚诈也。」
If one earnestly studies the Dao/Way, they cling to what they deem true, yet fail to transcend forgetfulness and illusion. Their understanding does not align with the genuine nature, thus they fall into emptiness and deceit.

「善复为妖，纵为善者，犹执名言，既乖正理，适为妖孽，故《庄子》云：为声为名，为妖为孽。」
Even when one acts with virtue, they still grasp at mere words—contrary to true principle, they become agents of *miao* and *nie*. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *"To cling to sound and name is to become *miao* and *nie*."*

「民之迷，其日固久。」
The people’s delusion has endured for ages.

「○御注：以正为奇，以善为妖，如此迷倒，其日固以久。」
**Imperial Annotation:** To take what is true as strange and virtue as *miao*, such profound delusion has indeed lasted long.

「○御疏：此叹众生迷於正善，妄以为奇为妖，其所由来尚矣，故云其日固久。」
**Imperial Exegesis:** This laments how sentient beings are deluded about true virtue, mistakenly calling it strange or *miao*. Their confusion is ancient, hence it is said their delusion endures.

「○河上公曰：言人君迷惑失正以来，其日固久也。」
**River Upper Master** said: It speaks of how rulers, since their confusion and loss of true principle, have been deluded for ages.

「○荣曰：迷祸福之源，惑邪正之路，此非旦夕，其日固久。」
**Master Rong** said: To be lost in the origins of calamity and fortune, bewildered by the paths of vice and virtue—this is no fleeting error, their delusion is indeed long-standing.

「成疏：言凡鄙之人，所以为妖奇者，以其愚痴迷惑故也。」
**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** Common folk become strange and *miao* because of their inherent stupidity and confusion.

「此之迷惑，其日久固，抑乃无始，岂日今生。」
This delusion has lasted long, yet it is not merely of recent origin—it began without a starting point, not just in this life.

「《西升经》云：如是迷来久。」
The *Sutra of Western Ascension* states: *"Thus, their delusion has endured for long."*

「第四显圣人忘功，韬光匿曜。」
Fourth, it reveals how the Sage forgets merit, conceals brilliance, and hides radiance.

「是以圣人方而不割，
**Imperial Exegesis:** Hence, the Sage is square yet does not cut—

「廉而不秽，
pure yet not defiled,

「直而不肆，
honest yet not self-righteous,

「光而不耀，」
brilliant yet not dazzling—
the Sage’s virtue transforms without cutting, defiling, or forcing. They cultivate within themselves, and the world naturally follows suit.

「圣人善化，不割彼而为方，不秽彼而为康，不申彼而为直，不耀彼而为光，修之身而天下自化矣。」
The Sage’s transformative power is gentle—never cutting to impose squareness, never defiling to bring purity, never asserting to enforce honesty, nor dazzling to manifest brightness. They refine within themselves, and the world spontaneously aligns.

「○御疏：方，正也。」
**Imperial Exegesis:** *Fang*, means upright.

「举圣德以劝修，圣人弘道济世，示物向方，身行方正，物则应之而自正，非立言教裁割於物使从己也。」
The Sage’s virtue is held up to encourage cultivation. The Sage expounds the Dao/Way and aids the world, guiding all toward rectitude. Their own conduct is upright, and things respond accordingly, becoming upright themselves—never imposing rigid teachings or cutting others to force compliance.

「○河上公曰：圣人行方正者，欲以率下，不以割截人也。」
**River Upper Master** said: The Sage acts with uprightness to lead the people below, never to cut or constrain them.

「○荣曰：方，正也，割，伤也，邪行则物我俱伤，正道则彼此无割。」
**Master Rong** said: *Fang* means upright; *ge* means harm. When vice prevails, both self and others are harmed. Yet in true principle, there is no mutual injury.

「廉而不秽，
Pure yet not defiled—

「○御疏：廉，清也。秽，浊也。圣人率性清康，自然化下，非秽彼之浊以扬其清。」
**Imperial Exegesis:** *Lian* means purity; *hui* means turbidity. The Sage follows their natural purity, effortlessly transforming the world below—never defiling others to elevate their own clarity.

「有本为创字者，创，伤也，圣人康以成行，不伤於物。」
Originally, *hui* was written as *chuang* (创), meaning harm. The Sage’s purity completes their conduct without harming others.

「○河上公曰：圣人康清欲以化民，不以伤害人也。」
**River Upper Master** said: The Sage’s purity aims to transform the people, never to harm them.

「今则不然，正己以害人也。」
Now it is otherwise: one rectifies themselves to harm others.

「○荣曰：凡情贪而浊，圣道康而清。」
**Master Rong** said: Common desires are greedy and turbid, while the Sage’s path is pure and clear.

「○成疏：妙体物境也空幻，无可贪取，非关卓尔清康，避世之秽，斯则净秽双遣，责康两忘，不康而康，秽而不秽，故《庄子》云：大康不嗛，又云：廉清不信。」
**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** The profound nature of all phenomena is empty and illusory—nothing to covet. This is not about standing out in purity or avoiding the world’s turbidity. Rather, it transcends both defilement and purity, casting off all dualistic notions of praise or blame, neither clinging to purity nor being bound by defilement. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *"Great purity is not rigid"* and *"Purity and clarity are not trusted."* (Note: *信* here as *trustworthy* in the sense of being rigid or dogmatic.)

「直而不肆，
Honest yet not self-righteous—

「○御疏：肆，申也。圣人之行不邪，彼自从而正直，非为彼之不正，而申直以正曲也。」
**Imperial Exegesis:** *Shi* (肆) means to assert. The Sage’s conduct is never crooked—others follow naturally, becoming upright. It is not about correcting others’ crookedness by forcing honesty upon them.

「○河上公曰：肆，申也，圣人虽直，曲己从人，不自申也。」
**River Upper Master** said: *Shi* means to assert. Though the Sage is honest, they bend to follow others, never asserting themselves.

「○荣曰：大直若届，不显正以示人。」
**Master Rong** said: Great honesty seems to yield—never flaunting uprightness to show others.

「○成疏：肆，申也。素质雅正，体无邪谄，而曲从於物，不申己直，故前章云大直若屈也。」
**Master Cheng’s Commentary:** *Shi* means to assert. The Sage’s innate nature is upright, their being free of deceit or flattery, yet they bend to follow things without asserting their own honesty. Hence, the previous chapter says: *"Great honesty seems to bow."*

「光而不耀。」
Brilliant yet not dazzling.

「○御疏：光者谓明智也，圣人虽有明智而韬晦之，不以炫耀，故云光而不耀。」
**Imperial Exegesis:** *Guang* refers to wisdom and clarity. Though the Sage possesses wisdom, they conceal it, never flaunting brilliance—thus it is said: *"Brilliant yet not dazzling."*

「圣德如此，自然百姓淳淳而从化也。」
The Sage’s virtue is thus: the people spontaneously become pure and follow transformation.

「○河上公曰：圣人虽有独知之明，常如暗昧，不以耀乱人也。」
**River Upper Master** said: Though the Sage possesses singular wisdom, they act as if in darkness, never dazzling others into confusion.

「○荣曰：明道若昧也，前标得失之政，次指祸福之门，而没溺者既多，昏迷者已久，妖奇则系累之境，倚伏非悬解之场，是以康而不秽，始体清虚之道，光而不耀，方识慧源之路，冥得失，何祸何福乎，混是非，孰邪孰正乎，泛兮无系无不系，肃然无可无不可。」
**Master Rong** said: The Sage’s clarity seems like obscurity. Though they reveal the principles of gain and loss, and the gates of calamity and fortune, many are drowned in ignorance, and many have been long in darkness. The strange and *miao* bind them in suffering, while dependence and subjugation offer no escape. Thus, purity without defilement begins with embodying the Dao of clarity and emptiness, brilliance without dazzle reveals the path of wisdom. In the depths of gain and loss, who knows of calamity or fortune? In the confusion of right and wrong, who discerns vice or virtue? Floating freely, neither bound nor unbound, solemn yet without constraint or possibility—*thus the Sage transcends all dualities.*

**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing People and Serving Heaven**

This chapter follows the previous one because, after clarifying the governance through the Dao to achieve purity and harmony, it further emphasizes governing people and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses the application of the Dao.

Within this chapter, four teachings unfold:
1. The first elucidates that governing the myriad people begins with the Dao.
2. The second asserts that even when employing the Dao, one must accumulate virtue and amass deeds.
3. The third reveals that such accumulation makes one a transformative sovereign.
4. The fourth demonstrates that deep-rooted stability ensures enduring vision and longevity.

**First: Governing the Myriad People Begins with the Dao.**
The Dao hangs like an empty vessel—yet those who deny it commit the greatest blasphemy. Virtue, when steadfast, becomes the fundamental principle for all.

A ruler of a realm must walk in rectitude, then the lofty peaks of Emei will bow, winds will descend upon the Celestial Sovereign’s hall, and the mountains of Yangjiao will summon the Sage of Li. Is this not proof that virtue lies in early submission, and the Dao is thus revered? When royal edicts are issued, all obey without hesitation—no one is expelled for three offenses. Loyalty and filial piety are embraced, while the King of Yang’s stern commands are obeyed first. Even the wine pools of Zhao and Mozi’s chariot turn back—thus, rectitude is the foundation of the state, while deceit is the work of men. In governing both people and Heaven, nothing surpasses the Dao.

To employ the Dao is to govern with ease; deceit and chaos are difficult to rectify. Those with deep roots and firm foundations, who endure and thrive, rely externally on spoken teachings and internally cultivate serenity. They endure Heaven’s floods without drifting, withstand Earth’s flames without scorching—no one knows their limits, for such is the result of accumulated virtue.

**Governing the People and Serving Heaven: Nothing Surpasses Frugality.**
*Imperial Commentary:* Frugality means love.

When a ruler seeks to govern people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality—ensuring granaries are full, people observe rites, and the three seasons bring no harm. Then Heaven will bestow blessings.

Harmony among the people governs them; Heaven’s protection serves Heaven.

*Imperial Exegesis:* Frugality means love. The ruler who wishes to transform the people and revere Heaven must first practice frugality—frugality is the virtue of thrift. Thrift ensures sufficiency, gathering the people. Abundant offerings honor Heaven’s virtue, hence, nothing surpasses frugality.

*River Above Master (严君平)*: Governing people means the ruler harmonizes the populace. Serving Heaven means employing Heaven’s ways, aligning with the four seasons. Nothing surpasses frugality—frugality is thrift. Governing a state requires cherishing the people’s wealth, avoiding extravagance. Governing oneself means cherishing one’s vital essence, avoiding dissipation.

*Li Rong (李荣)*: To govern below and serve above, nothing exceeds using the Dao as the standard.

*Master Cheng (成玄英)*: Heaven is nature; the standard is law. Nothing surpasses means there is no better way. The ruler who harmonizes with Heaven’s ways and transforms the common folk does so by employing the law of *wuwei* (non-action).

**Only frugality is called early submission.**
*Imperial Commentary:* How does one gather the people? Through wealth—when a ruler practices frugality, people from all directions will bring tribute, submitting early to their lord.

*Imperial Exegesis:* *Only frugality*—repeating the earlier phrase. Thus, early submission explains the meaning of frugality. In all seven transformations, the meaning follows this pattern. *Only* is an introductory phrase. *Submission* means service. Only a ruler who restrains and cherishes will govern people and serve Heaven through frugality, and thus all under Heaven will submit early.

*River Above Master:* Early means prior; submission means virtue. The ruler who cherishes the people’s wealth and vital essence will first attain Heaven’s ways.

*Li Rong:* Using the Dao as the standard, all things will naturally converge.

*Master Cheng:* This *wuwei* law alone benefits both self and others. Applied to governing the body, it subdues all demons and trials; applied to governing the state, it draws distant lands into submission.

**Second: Even When Employing the Dao, One Must Accumulate Virtue and Amass Deeds.**
Early submission is called *accumulating virtue*.

*Imperial Commentary:* The ruler who practices frugality thus accumulates virtue, and the people, drawn to virtue, submit early to their lord—hence, *accumulating virtue*.

*Imperial Exegesis:* Why does all under Heaven revere and submit? Because of practiced frugality—frugality ensures the people submit early, thus virtue is deeply accumulated.

*River Above Master:* Attaining Heaven’s ways first is called accumulating virtue for oneself.

*Li Rong:* The Dao is light, virtue shallow—people will not submit. When virtue is deeply accumulated, all things will naturally submit.

*Master Cheng:* *Accumulating* means deep accumulation; *virtue* means layered virtue. This speaks to those who internally subdue demons and externally pacify distant lands—one must accumulate deeds, making virtue profound before distant lands submit.

**Accumulating virtue ensures nothing is unconquered.**
*Imperial Commentary:* The Sage accumulates virtue, and all under Heaven turns to benevolence—nothing remains unconquered.

*Imperial Exegesis:* *Conquered* means ability. If a ruler deeply accumulates virtue, his governance will preserve all human strength, and his service to Heaven will bring unending good fortune. Thus, all under Heaven will submit, and nothing will remain unconquered.

*River Above Master:* *Conquered* means subdued. Deeply accumulating virtue ensures nothing resists.

*Li Rong:* Profound virtue and deep benevolence ensure nothing is unconquered.

*Master Cheng:* *Conquered* means both subdued and attained. Accumulating deeds makes virtue profound, benefiting both self and others without loss. Internally and externally subdued, nothing remains unconquered.

**Nothing is unconquered, thus no limits are known.**
*Imperial Commentary:* A ruler’s virtue knows no inability to govern—thus, its reach is boundless, and all under Heaven knows no extremity.

*Imperial Exegesis:* This means a ruler’s virtue knows no inability to subdue—thus, distant peoples admire and submit, and no land remains untouched. Hence, no limits are known.

**Nothing is unconquered, thus no limits are known to one’s own virtue.**

*River Above Master:* If nothing is unconquered and attained, then none will know the limits of one’s own virtue.

*Yan (严) says:* If one takes frugality as the principle, the world will respond in harmony with the Dao—how could anyone know its limits?

*Li Rong (荣) says:* When the four barbarian tribes submit as guests, borders vanish, and governance aligns with the Dao’s mystery—what limits could there be?

*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:* When capacity and object harmonize, principle knows no discord. Virtue and power stretch boundless, none able to fathom their limits.

**Third, it illustrates that by accumulating deeds and amassing merit, one may become the master of transformation.**

If no limits are known, then one may have a realm.
*Imperial Commentary:* Only when none know the limits of one’s virtue can one truly be said to have a realm.

*Imperial Exegesis:* It speaks of a ruler whose transforming virtue reaches everywhere, whose merit draws all people, whose divine favor is ever bestowed—thus may one be called as having a realm. Beyond this, how could one claim to have a realm?

*River Above Master:* If none know the limits of one’s own virtue, then one may establish the ancestral altars and bring blessings to the people.

*Li Rong (荣) says:* Lands are boundless, virtue and power know no end—only then may one truly have a realm.

*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:* Since principle knows no discord and virtue stretches boundless, one may thus have a realm to govern and transform the people, becoming a sovereign or a master of transformation.

**The mother of having a realm is what makes it enduring.**

*Imperial Commentary:* A realm that nurtures its people well will endure in blessings and longevity.

*Imperial Exegesis:* "Mother" refers to the Dao, with nurturing as its meaning. Only because of the Dao may one be called as having a realm, and if one nurtures the common folk as such, blessings and longevity will flourish eternally, making it enduring.

*River Above Master:* A realm and its ruler are one in essence; "mother" is the Dao. If one can preserve the Dao within oneself, ensuring one’s *qi* is not exhausted and the five spirits are not strained, then one may endure.

*Li Rong (荣) says:* With the Dao, a realm is secure; without it, a realm is in peril. A realm arises from the Dao, and the Dao is the realm’s mother. To take the Dao as mother is why one may endure.

*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:* The Conqueror-King (霸王) and the Dragon-King (龙成) say: Since they are rulers and sovereigns, nurturing the common folk like their own children, they are thus called "mother." Though their virtue and deeds are lofty, they do not cling to action or empty detachment—thus they may endure.

**Fourth, it illustrates deep-rooted stability and lasting vision.**

This is the Dao of deep-rooted stability, enduring life, and lasting vision.

*Imperial Commentary:* Accumulating virtue to have a realm makes its roots deep and its foundation firm. The deep and firm is the Dao of enduring life and lasting vision.

*Imperial Exegesis:* A ruler who accumulates virtue takes the Dao as their realm, and thus may endure. Hence, the analogy of roots and foundation is invoked to clarify its meaning. The "foundation" (蒂) is like the stalk of a flower. Just as plants with deep roots flourish and firm stalks do not fall, so too is their enduring nature. It likens a ruler who accumulates virtue, planting their roots in the Dao and securing their foundation in virtue—extending life is called enduring life, and constant illumination is called lasting vision. Thus, it is the Dao of deep-rooted stability, enduring life, and lasting vision.

*River Above Master:* This is the Dao of deep-rooted stability. If one can take *qi* as root and essence as foundation, like a tree whose roots are not deep and will be uprooted, or whose stalk is not firm and will fall—one must deeply conceal their *qi* and firmly guard their essence, not allowing it to leak away. The Dao of enduring life and lasting vision is that of deep-rooted stability.

*Li Rong (荣) says:* If roots rot, the stalk collapses; if the foundation decays, the stalk falls. Now, to govern with the Dao as root makes it deep, and to cultivate oneself with virtue as foundation makes it firm. A firm foundation brings enduring life, deep roots bring lasting vision—this is the pattern of heaven and humanity, the essentials of family and realm.

*Master Cheng’s Exegesis:* Root is origin. Foundation is the manifestation. The root can generate the foundation, likening how origin can produce traces. The traces are called deep-rooted, and the origin is called firm-foundation. If roots are not deep, they will topple; if the foundation is not firm, it will crumble. Only because of deep roots does one endure life, and only because of a firm foundation does one attain lasting vision. This shows that the sage who has a realm possesses both origin and traces in perfection, hence the text says: "The Dao of deep-rooted stability, enduring life, and lasting vision."

**Vision is illumination.**

*Chapter on Governing Great Realms, Chapter Sixty*
The chapter on governing great realms follows the previous one, for the prior chapter illustrates that if one aligns with the Dao in frugality and love, all affairs will be swiftly subdued, while this chapter shows that if one does not disturb the already subdued, then virtue will be mutually returned.

The text is divided into three parts: the first introduces the analogy of governing with the Dao, emphasizing non-action; the second shows that virtue benefits both people and spirits, causing no harm; the third concludes with praise for the mutual return of virtue, urging rulers who have realms.

**First, it introduces the analogy of governing with the Dao, emphasizing non-action.**

For it is heard that the ruler is the primary leader—
Holding the Dao in silence and facing the people, ministers serve as limbs and sinews, adjusting the transformations of yin and yang to regulate affairs. The Bear and the Tiger bow in submission, while the lower immortals ascend their halls to set the winds in motion. Sometimes wild geese fly into the court, or celestial dragons descend upon the thoroughfares, startling the world with transformation. All desire to engage in non-action, to settle the restless heart, to move like the deer that tames itself, to govern with such precision that the smallest fish cannot be harmed, and to ensure the four quarters find their place while the people all dwell in peace.

Yet, as seen in Ximen Bao’s lack of benevolence, drowning widows was excessive. As seen in Jiang Ziya’s embrace of virtue, the spirit maiden wept in the courtyard, and he transformed the chaotic customs like untying a knot, and his governance was as refined as weaving silk. Then, heads bowed in reverence as heaven took notice, stubborn necks submitted to human authority, fires were extinguished in Jiangling, and strange apparitions vanished in the cities. Ghosts did not bring calamity, spirits suffered no harm—thus virtue was mutually returned, and the world looked up to the pure and upright example.

**To govern a great realm is like to cook a small fish.**

*Imperial Exegesis:* Cooking means boiling. A small fish is a small fish. If one cooks a small fish improperly, it will break apart. It likens governing a great realm: if one troubles the people, they will fall into disorder. All must rely on the Dao to achieve success.

「The second elucidates virtue/power and the relationship with ghosts and spirits—both without harm. Those who spread the Dao across the world will find their ghosts unspirited.

**Rong’s Commentary:** Governing a realm with excess troubles the populace, leading to chaos; refining oneself with excess troubles the spirit, causing it to scatter. When one spreads the Dao across the world, the ghosts remain unspirited. *Yi* means "to use"; *ling* means "to manifest."

**Imperial Exegesis:** Ghosts and spirits manifest in seclusion as the forces of the unseen. The term *lingxiao* (灵效) refers to their efficacy. When humans have desires, the spirits respond. Yet under the transformation of supreme virtue/power, people dwell in natural ease—how could it be only that the sovereign forgets the might of the spirits, but also that they do not rely on supplication? Thus, the ghosts in seclusion lack the means to manifest their efficacy.

It is not that these ghosts are unspirited, but that the spirits do not harm the people. **Imperial Exegesis:** When ghosts manifest monstrously, they harm people; when the sage acts, they harm people. Now, the reason ghosts do not manifest monstrously nor harm people is that the sage abides in non-action and tranquility.

**Imperial Commentary:** The saying that spirits do not harm people—does it mean only that spirits lack efficacy and cannot harm people? Rather, the sage governs with the Dao, causing no disturbance; the populace naturally aligns with righteousness. Hence, the sage also does not harm people. Then, the reason ghosts and spirits cannot manifest monstrously nor harm people is that the sage spreads the Dao across the world. To further clarify the sage’s virtue/power, it is repeated that the sage also does not harm people.

**River Above Master (河上公):** It is not that ghosts and spirits cannot harm people; rather, when the sage holds office, they do not dare to interfere, for the sage does not harm people.

**Rong’s Commentary:** These ghosts and spirits cannot harm people, but when the sage presides above, virtue/power extends to both the seen and unseen, and ghosts and spirits cause no harm—because the sage does not harm.

They can also benefit the people, and thus they themselves do not harm.

**Imperial Commentary:** All versions write *yi* (亦), but only Zhang Xishan (张系师) and Lu Xiansheng (陆先生) use *zhi* (之). Since *zhi* and *yi* are similar in form, scribes mistakenly wrote *yi*. Now, we adopt *zhi* as correct. It means that these ghosts do not harm the people, but rather, it is because the sage governs the world with the Dao, subduing evil and wickedness, that the ghosts no longer harm people. The power lies in the sage’s governance, hence the saying that the sage does not harm people.

**Imperial Exegesis (治身者):** When refining oneself, it is not that stirring the heart cannot harm conduct—rather, the sage’s wisdom suppresses and controls such stirrings, so even if the heart moves, it cannot harm the stillness. Thus, the inner and outer conduct both return to the self.

If one is both still and in motion, what is being suppressed? Now, it is clarified that suppression occurs even when there is no suppression, and response occurs even when there is no response—meaning that the response arises naturally.

**The Third: Seclusion and Manifestation Observe Their Boundaries, Virtue and Wisdom Return Together.**
Since both do not harm each other, virtue/power is mutually returned.

**Imperial Exegesis:** When ghosts and spirits harm people, it harms the realm and depletes its foundation; when the sage harms people, it exhausts the spirit and lacks reverence. Now, since neither harms the other, virtue/power is mutually returned.

**Imperial Commentary:** The two refer to the sage and the spirits. Humans are the foundation of the realm and also the master of the spirits. If ghosts and spirits harm people, it harms the realm’s foundation; if the sage harms people, it exhausts the spirit’s master. Now, since neither harms the other, virtue/power is mutually returned. Not only do the spirits and sage flourish alone, but all people also rely on this. **River Above Master:** Since both do not harm each other—the ghosts and the sage—virtue/power is mutually returned. When both do not harm each other, the people are governed in the seen, the ghosts in the unseen; the people preserve their lives, the ghosts safeguard their spirits, hence virtue/power is mutually returned.

**Rong’s Commentary:** Ghosts, spirits, and the sage—these are the two. Both can benefit the people without harm. The sage is compassionate and kind, the ghosts and spirits are upright and just; compassion and kindness manifest in the seen and shine brightly, while uprightness and justice dwell in the unseen and quietly accumulate. Both bestow virtue/power and blessings upon the people, thus virtue/power and wisdom return together.

**Imperial Commentary:** The two refer to ghosts dwelling in the unseen and humans in the seen. Seclusion and manifestation each find their place, without mutual harm. Then, humans bestow virtue/power upon ghosts, and ghosts repay with blessings—virtue and kindness flow in return, hence they mutually adhere.

**Imperial Exegesis (治身者):** Refining oneself means suppressing agitation to return to stillness, thus perfecting one’s conduct. From stillness arises motion, to respond to the myriad people; motion does not contradict stillness, hence there is no harm. This is why inner and outer conduct both return to the self.

**The Great Realm Chapter: Chapter Sixty-One**
The *Great Realm* chapter follows the previous one because the prior chapter elucidates the use of the Dao and non-action in subduing and testing malevolent forces. Thus, this chapter follows, clarifying the use of the Dao in dealing with people while maintaining the power of humility and harmony.

This chapter opens three distinct meanings:
1. It elucidates dealing with people through humility and harmony, using stillness to suppress agitation;
2. It elucidates the small and great observing their boundaries, each possessing their own yielding and firm qualities;
3. It elucidates restraining the high and proud to extinguish their arrogance and ambition.

「The First Meaning: Dealing with Others in Humility and Harmony, Using Stillness to Suppress Agitation
The myriad rivers converge at the sea, the Four Great Elements[注: *四大*, the classical Buddhist elements of earth, water, fire, and wind] in their majesty are called *King*[注: *王*, here symbolizing supreme authority]. The King, though solitary and exalted, is said to be *Na-Guo*[注: *孤寡*, a term of self-effacement], while the sea, in its boundless embrace, attains greatness. Thus, one knows that mountains, though steep and towering, further enhance the earth’s lowly and yielding nature, while the sea’s virtue is vast and deep, gathering all rivers into its embrace. The lowly flow receives the multitude, the humble retreat becomes the object of reverence. Zi Gong borrowed horses and never returned them, while Liu Kuang begged for a cow before sending one in return—both acts stemmed from minds untroubled by ambition, their wills aligned with yielding and harmony. Small states thus find attachment through submission, while great states are enriched by acts of deference and self-restraint. To hold victory in strength is to err; words that do not align with this principle are flawed. The virtuous of later ages may follow this intent.

The great state is the lowly confluence, the meeting place of all under heaven.

**Commentary by Yu Zhu:**
The lowly confluence is the virtue of humility.

The great state must open itself in humility and embrace others, thus becoming the meeting place of all under heaven.

**Exegesis by Yu Shuo:**
The rivers and streams descend to the sea, and all converge there—hence, the term *lowly confluence*. This humility in bestowing upon others is the virtue of humility.

The ruler of a state, if he follows the Dao, preserves his realm; if he lacks virtue, his people scatter. Thus, the great state must open itself in humility and embrace others, allowing all under heaven to gather and meet, thereby securing its grandeur—hence, the saying: *The great state is the lowly confluence, the meeting place of all under heaven*.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
The great state is the lowly confluence—one must govern a great state as though dwelling in the lowly confluence, not resisting the smallest currents. The meeting place of all under heaven is where the people of the world gather.

**Yan says:**
The great state is vast in territory; with the Dao, it is steadfast as a *Pan Shi*[注: *盘石*, a massive, unyielding rock], secure as *Tai Shan*[注: *泰山*, Mount Tai, symbolizing stability]. Without the Dao, it is perilous as a *Lei Mao*[注: *累卯*, a pile of unstable stones], lighter than a *Hong Mao*[注: *鸿毛*, feather]. It should not arrogantly exalt itself.

**Rong says:**
*Exchange* means *convergence*. The sea lies beneath all currents, and rivers thus gather there. Likewise, the ruler of a great state, in self-perception, must regard himself as deficient, so that all states may unite in reverence.

**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**
The great state is a realm of *Ten Thousand Chariots*[注: *万乘*, a state with vast military resources]. *Confluence* refers to the outer suburbs[注: *郊郭*, outskirts or borders]. *The* means *to go*. The great state, in its magnanimity, is like the rivers and seas, receiving all currents beneath it—thus, all states vie to pour their tribute. The great state, through its Dao of humility and harmony, gathers all realms, near and far, in allegiance, filling its borders with those who follow its virtue. The term *exchange* here also refers to the great state’s humility, enabling its convergence with smaller states.

The meeting place of all under heaven is *feminine*—for the feminine always triumphs through stillness over the masculine.

**Commentary by Yu Zhu:**
The people of the world gather because they are drawn to the great state’s humility, just as the feminine, through its yielding stillness, is always sought by the restless masculine—hence, stillness is the path of humility.

**Exegesis by Yu Shuo:**
The term *meeting place of all under heaven* echoes earlier passages, reinforcing the meaning of *lowly confluence*. It states that the people of the world gather because the ruler of the great state employs the Dao of humility, allowing the feminine to prevail in its yielding stillness, which is why it is sought by the restless masculine—hence, *the feminine always triumphs through stillness over the masculine*.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
The feminine Dao of the great state is rooted in still humility. The feminine bends the masculine, and yin overcomes yang, for it remains tranquil and does not seek first.

**Rong says:**
The feminine is yielding and still, the masculine is forceful and restless. Stillness can govern restlessness, yin can bend yang—thus, one knows that humility subdues arrogance, and weakness overcomes strength. Stillness is the path of humility.

**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**
The term *meeting place of all under heaven* reiterates the earlier passage. The feminine is yielding and still, the masculine is forceful and restless. The great state’s ability to make all states submit and converge lies in its constant use of humility and yielding stillness, thereby triumphing over forceful restlessness. If it were to employ force and restlessness, it would fail to attract them. Thus, one knows that governing oneself and one’s state must begin with yielding and harmony.

The Second Meaning: Small and Great States Observe Their Boundaries, Each Employing Their Own Yielding and Firm Qualities.
Thus, the great state submits to the small state and takes from it;
**Commentary by Yu Zhu:**
The great takes from the small, making them subjects.

The small takes from the great, seeking aid.

**Exegesis by Yu Shuo:**
*Thus* follows the preceding passage, reinforcing its meaning. The ruler of the great state does not rely on coercion but on the virtue of humility to gently subdue others, intending to draw in the rulers of smaller states, taking their people as subjects.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
If one can practice humility, it will always endure. Thus, there will be no faults.

**Rong says:**
Humility as virtue can contain others; if one cannot yet be humble and yielding, they cannot gather or be taken.

**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**
*With* means *to employ*; *humility* means *yielding deference*; *taking* means *to transform and assimilate*. The Sage-ruler, when presiding over a great state, skillfully employs humility and harmony, thereby transforming and assimilating all realms, near and distant, into submission. Is this not fitting?

The small state submits to the great state and takes from it;
**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**
The great state’s ruler, having employed the Dao of humility to gently subdue the small state, sees the small state’s ruler offering tribute, attending court, and forming alliances, never daring to rebel. The small state’s ruler, in his yielding deference, seeks the great state’s protection as aid.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
This says that states have no small or great—if one can hold humility and gather others, there will be no faults.

**Exegesis by Cheng Shuo:**
The small state, knowing its own humility, observes its boundaries, yielding and gathering within the great state’s embrace, following its virtue and revering its customs.»

「Thus, sometimes one yields to take, and sometimes one yields while taking. **Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** *Yielding to take* refers to the great state subduing the small; *yielding while taking* refers to the small state submitting to the great.

**Master He Shang Gong’s Exegesis:**
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: *"When a teacher can command both left and right, it is called 'yielding to take.'"*
When one yields to take, it means the great state employs the Dao of humility to subdue the small state, thereby making its ruler compliant—able to be swayed either left or right. Hence, it is called *yielding to take*.
When one yields while taking, it means the small state employs the Dao of humility to submit to the great state, only seeking to pay tribute and receive aid, unable to command its own left and right at will. Hence, it is called *yielding while taking*.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
Yielding means the great state yields to the small state, and the small state yields to the great state, taking turns in offering virtue and deference.

**Master Rong says:**
This is about uniting two states.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Sometimes, the small state uses softness and thus takes from the great state; sometimes, the great state uses humility and thus earns the favor of all states. The use of humility unites them, but the act of taking separates them—hence the word *sometimes*.
The great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others, while the small state seeks only to enter and serve others. **Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** The great state, when employing humility to subdue the small state, seeks only to encompass and nurture the small state’s people as subjects. The small state, when offering tribute and paying homage to the great state, seeks only to enter and serve the great state for aid.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
When the great state uses humility to subdue the small state, it has no ulterior motive—only to encompass and nurture the small state’s people as its ruler. When the small state uses humility to seek the great state’s favor, it has no other intention—only to enter and serve the great state, relying on it for aid.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
The great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others, so it must not be lost—thus it annexes and shepherds smaller states. The small state seeks only to enter and serve others, becoming their subjects and servants.

**Master Rong says:**
The great state must spread its influence far and wide, embodying the august virtue of the sovereign. The small state must only reverence the Dao’s transformation, seeking to submit within its boundaries. Both fulfill their aspirations, yet the great state should especially practice humility.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
The two states—great and small—each seek their own desires: the great state to encompass and nurture, the small state to enter and serve. Though both employ softness and humility, the great state should particularly practice humility, for things are never lightened by the small but always oppressed by the great. Thus, the great state is commanded to yield, embodying the meaning of *"the high should be restrained."*

**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao/Way as Chapter**
This chapter follows the previous one, which expounded on guarding stillness, practicing humility, and employing the Dao in interactions. Hence, this chapter reveals the Dao’s profound essence, guiding all things to return in dependence.

This chapter unfolds four distinct themes:
1. The Dao’s ability to embrace all, urging beings to cherish it;
2. Its refusal to abandon the lowly, perpetually extending great compassion;
3. Its discernment of advantage and harm, clarifying victory and defeat;
4. Its hypothetical questions, praising the Dao’s transformative power.

---
**First: The Dao’s Ability to Embrace All, Urging Beings to Cherish It**
The great Dao is without partiality, the supreme mystery that encompasses all. Its divine power is unending, a treasure for those who recognize goodness. It stands beyond the golden gates, transcending the iron barriers, descending to the humble and nourishing them, even as they float on a fleeting life. It dwells in the boundless, yet remains serene in its origin, its song eternal and its harmony everlasting. Within the lion’s throne, fierce beasts gather, yet when the moment arises, they act in accordance. When the opportunity fades, they forget. The heart wanders freely in the pool of liberation, riding the vessel of compassion to save all beings.

Thus, the Son of Heaven is established, the Three Dukes appointed, the four steeds of black and white dismissed, and a single carriage alone is used for progress. The adornments of jade and the rituals of obeisance—how vast are they! Yet none surpass the virtue of urging all to follow this Dao, ever increasing.

The Dao is the supreme mystery of all things.
**Master He Shang Gong’s Annotation:** All things draw their origin from the wondrous source; this is the place from which they derive sustenance. Hence, it is called the supreme mystery of all things.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
The Dao is another name for the wondrous source. *Mystery* means *inner*—the Dao contains all without exclusion, the origin from which all things arise. Hence, it is called the supreme mystery of all things. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: *"The Dao is profound and mysterious, the fountain of emptiness and nothingness"*—this is what is meant.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
*Mystery* means *hidden*—the Dao is the hidden treasure of all things, containing all without exception.

**Master Yan says:**
All things take form from Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth arise from the formless. The Dao, through the formless form, opens the void, guides divine illumination, unites Heaven and Earth, penetrates yin and yang, flows through the four seasons, and governs the myriad regions. Though shapes and kinds differ, all are able to manifest and transform. It governs the eternal cycle of change, yet remains without constant, without favor or aversion—harmonizing with all things in great unity.

**Master Rong says:**
The Dao is the hidden essence of all things, the precious treasure of the virtuous, and the refuge of the unvirtuous. Treasure means weighty—though the Dao is formless in its root, its principle is purely empty and still. Yet it enfolds the formless within manifest symbols, and receives the empty and still into the movements of living beings. Thus it is called the hidden essence of all things.

The refined and upright, with their rectitude, can hold fast to the true. The base and foolish, entangled in perversity, scorn the Dao. Hence there are those who treasure it and those who do not.

**Master Cheng’s commentary:**
The Dao is the wondrous principle of boundless emptiness, the innate nature of all sentient beings. Hidden means profound and secret, also the repository of treasures. The Dao can generate all existence, encompassing the myriad spirits, with nothing it does not contain. Thus it is the repository and hidden treasure of all things.

The precious treasure of the virtuous.
**Imperial Commentary:** The virtuous know that those who uphold the Dao flourish, while those who abandon it perish. Therefore, they always cherish and value it, without ever neglecting it.

**Imperial Exegesis:** Treasure means precious and valuable. The virtuous, being in accord with the Dao and practicing non-action, maintain purity in body and mind. Thus they cherish and value it, without ever straying from it.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** The virtuous regard the Dao as their most precious treasure, not daring to defy it.

**Master Cheng’s commentary:** Those who practice the Dao and are virtuous perceive true nature, and obtain the mystic pearl from the Crimson Stream. Thus they are able to cherish and value it.

The refuge of the unvirtuous.
**Imperial Commentary:** Refuge means entrusting. The unvirtuous, unable to cherish the supreme Dao, when confronted with calamity or urgency, resort to relying upon the Dao with their bodies to seek deliverance.

**Imperial Exegesis:** Refuge means to guard and uphold. Common folk are immersed in material attachments, their dispositions shallow and competitive. How could they guard and uphold it? Fine words can be bought, noble conduct can be rewarded.

**Master He Shang Gong says:** The Dao is the refuge of the unvirtuous. Even in times of suffering and peril, they still know to repent and humble themselves.

**Imperial Annotation:**
To sweeten one’s speech so that it may be sold like merchandise, to elevate one’s conduct so that it may surpass others—this is to liken the Sage, who employs speech as sweet as lawful flavors and conduct as noble and pure, to transform the unvirtuous. Thus, like merchants selling their wares, they follow the good.

**Imperial Exegesis:**
This is an illustrative metaphor. It means that even the unvirtuous are within the scope of instruction. The Annotation says: *"Sweetened speech can be sold like merchandise; noble conduct can surpass others."* This likens the Sage, who employs speech as sweet as lawful flavors and conduct as noble and pure, to transform the unvirtuous—just as merchants sell their goods, and people follow the good in turn. Hence the following passage.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
*"Sweet speech can be sold like merchandise."* Sweet speech alone can be sold in the marketplace. Truly, in market transactions, once the exchange is complete, there is no further harmony or goodness. Those who speak sweetly seek to obtain quickly, and those who sell seek to dispose of their goods quickly. *"Noble conduct can surpass others."* *Surpass* here means to distinguish oneself. If one has noble conduct, it can set them apart from ordinary people, but this is still insufficient to uphold the Dao.

**Master Rong says:**
Those who embody the Dao forget about words; sincere words are not sweetened. Elaborate arguments that conceal falsehoods cannot truly grasp the real. Empty speech that loses substance—how could it be worthy of the Dao? Flowery words deceive the masses, adorn falsehood as truth, and idle theories confuse people, turning evil into good. Such speech may only be useful in the marketplace—how could it establish virtue and embrace the Dao?

Those who attain the supreme Dao forget distinctions between self and others; those who awaken to nature merge into harmonious unity. How could one exalt oneself while belittling others, claim oneself while rejecting others, or place oneself above all things?

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
The unvirtuous have shallow hearts and actions, often speaking flatteringly and adorning their words with empty rhetoric, just like merchants in the marketplace vying for profit. Yet they cannot practice gentle humility, prioritize others, or humble themselves—only to then exalt their own conduct and domineer over others. Such are the unvirtuous; how distant they are from the Dao!

**Secondly, it clarifies that the wise do not abandon the foolish, extending boundless compassion.**

Though people may be unvirtuous, how could they be abandoned?

**Imperial Annotation:**
Even the unvirtuous are within the scope of transformation—how could they be cast aside?

**Imperial Exegesis:**
It says that though people’s speech and conduct may be unvirtuous, how could they be abandoned? One must guide them with the good Dao, hoping they will reform through transformation. It is not permissible to abandon them without instruction, hence the saying: *"How could they be abandoned?"*

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
Though people may be unvirtuous, they must be transformed through the Dao. Before the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people—virtue and transformation were pure.

**Master Rong says:**
The Sage’s teachings are established to enlighten the ignorant. The wondrous Dao is vast and far-reaching, yet it is also perfected for those not yet awakened. It seeks to make both the virtuous and unvirtuous good, and both the knowing and ignorant wise. The Sage constantly rescues people—how could there be any abandonment?

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*Deliberately*—why? The Sage’s enlightenment is profound and universal. Even if beings are unvirtuous, how could there be a heart of abandonment? It reveals boundless compassion, covering and aiding all without exception.

Thus, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Ministers are appointed.

**Imperial Annotation:**
To instruct the unvirtuous.

**Imperial Exegesis:**
The Three Ministers refer to the Grand Teacher, Grand Tutor, and Grand Guardian. The Son of Heaven governs without action, while the Three Ministers discuss the Dao, all serving as models to establish teachings and transform the unvirtuous. As the *Book of Documents* says: *"Heaven’s work is continued by humanity"*—this is what is meant.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
To transform the unvirtuous through instruction.

**Master Rong says:**
In the most ancient times, the wise and foolish were equal, their bodies not straying from the Dao, their actions in harmony with nature—all treasured the Dao. But from the Three Dynasties onward, things grew corrupt. Without a ruler to guide people, and with a sovereign to transform them, the upper echelons established the *Wenhui* (literally, "cultural harmony") system, while below, officials were appointed to discuss the Dao. They demonstrated good and evil, admonished with rites and laws, transforming the unvirtuous and cultivating pure customs.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Since the Sage’s enlightenment covers all without exception, it is fitting to establish methods to aid the world. Thus, the Son of Heaven is established to govern all affairs, and the Three Ministers are appointed to discuss the Dao. They regulate yin and yang, refine governance, and intend to guide all beings, protecting them from harm.

Since the opening of creation, true sovereigns have appeared in the world—all embodying the Dao’s adaptive responses as emperors and kings, thus symbolizing the Three Pure Ones and establishing their officials.

**Thirdly, it weighs benefits and harms to clarify victory and defeat.**

Even with a *hongbi* (a large jade tablet) presented ahead of four horses, it is not as good as submitting to this Dao while seated.

**Imperial Annotation:**
Though the Three Ministers assist with offerings—even a *hongbi* jade tablet and four fine horses presented first—it is still not as precious as submitting to this Dao of *wuwei* to the sovereign for transforming people.

**Imperial Exegesis:**
A *hongbi* is a large jade tablet; four horses are the finest steeds. It says that though the Three Ministers, as ministers, present such treasures to the sovereign, they are still not as valuable as submitting the Dao of *wuwei* to transform evil into good.

The *hongbi* precedes the four horses because, in ancient tribute missions, one would first present the four horses, with the jade tablet as a guide—hence *"preceding."* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *"Driving a chariot with leather fittings and twelve oxen to reward the army"*—this is the same.

**Master He Shang Gong says:**
Even if one arrives with a *hongbi* and four horses, it is still not as good as submitting to this Dao.

**Master Rong says:**
In ancient times, reclusive scholars would first present a jade tablet, then a horse—hence *"preceding the four horses."* Those who invert right and wrong must be exposed with their deceits; those who cling to folly must be illuminated by wisdom’s torch.

To serve as the sovereign’s inner counsel and the ruler’s pillars of support—this is to rectify their evil and aid in propagating teachings.

「Yet those who value fame are not content with their station, recklessly aspiring to honors beyond their merit. Those who crave favor do not follow the Dao but only seek lofty titles. By indulging in arrogance and extravagance, they invite misfortune upon themselves, ultimately facing ruin—far worse than cultivating the supreme Dao, where neither favor nor disgrace can perturb.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
The *hongbi* (拱璧) is the *hongbi* (拱把) jade tablet—when presenting a whole, round tablet, one must first fast and bow in reverence. Only then does one send the four horses. Though one may attain wealth and honor through a grandly adorned jade tablet, it is still inferior to the effortless practice of *zuowang* (坐忘), refining oneself in this Dao. Why so? For cultivating the Dao brings eternal life, while wealth and honor are but fleeting breaths. Hence, **Master Guangchengzi** (广成子) says:
*"Life in the world is like a cloud soaring in the sky—
its form dissolves in an instant.
To measure it thus, nothing surpasses distance."*

○ **Fourth Hypothesis and Admiration of Dao’s Power:**
Why was the Dao held in such esteem in antiquity?

○ **Imperial Commentary:**
*"Why"* (何) here is a question word.

○ **Imperial Commentary:**
To cite ancient examples and prove their relevance today, inspiring trust in all things.
The ancients were the same as those who cherished the Dao and practiced virtue.
Why did they hold the Dao in such high regard?
○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**
In antiquity, the Dao was prized because one need not travel far to seek it—it is found within oneself.

○ **Master Rong says:**
From ancient times to the present, what does it mean to hold the Dao in such high regard?
One does not seek it for a single day and yet obtains it,
practicing it to avoid calamities for a hundred years,
ensuring blessings and longevity while severing ties with danger and ruin.
Thus, the ancients and the present alike revered it,
and all under Heaven and the gods cherish it universally.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
It speaks of why the sages of old treasured the Dao so deeply.
It is because one does not need to spend a day seeking it before attaining it—
this refers to those who awaken and perceive the Dao immediately,
while the deluded may wander countless kalpas without comprehension.
Even if since beginningless time,
one has been bound by the cycles of birth and death,
and by sin and suffering—
should one attain it, one may instantly return to the source,
freeing oneself from all burdens.
Such divine power is beyond imagination,
hence the Dao is revered by all under Heaven.

Is it not because one does not need to seek it daily before attaining it?
And because one’s sins are pardoned?
Thus, the Dao is held in highest esteem.

○ **Imperial Commentary:**
The Dao lies in awakening, not in seeking.
Unlike wealth and goods, which can be sought daily and obtained,
the Dao is not attained through daily effort.
Awakening means no sins accumulate—
this is why it is held in highest esteem.

○ **Imperial Commentary:**
This explains why the Dao is cherished.
*"One does not need to seek it daily before attaining it"*—
the Dao lies in awakening,
and awakening is the clarity of the mind,
not like the active methods of the world,
which require years of accumulation and striving to achieve.
But if one clears the heart and extinguishes desire,
purity arises naturally.
Thus, *"one does not need to seek it daily before attaining it."*

*"And because one’s sins are pardoned?"*—
When the mind is lost in delusion and defilement,
the burden of karma arises.
But if one awakens to the Dao and embraces emptiness,
the causes of sin perish on their own.
How can this compare to those who cling to rigid attachments,
whose every action spawns regret and remorse,
who are ensnared by guilt and punishment yet still seek release?
For this reason alone,
the Dao is treasured by all virtuous men.

○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**
*"And because one’s sins are pardoned"*—
those who commit sin are those who face turbulent times and tyrannical rulers,
who rashly impose punishments.
Yet cultivating the Dao can dissolve death itself,
freeing one from all suffering.
Thus, the Dao is held in highest esteem,
for its virtue and power permeate all things,
preserving life and governing the realm with effortless harmony.
Hence, it is revered by all under Heaven.

○ **Chapter Sixty-Three: The Method of *Wuwei* (無為)**
This chapter follows the previous one,
for the earlier chapter expounded the righteousness of urging all to return to the Dao,
whereby one’s sins are pardoned.
Thus, this chapter illustrates the method of returning to the Dao,
and the means of absolving sin.

Within this chapter, three distinct teachings unfold:
The first clarifies that action does not contradict stillness—
this is the method of returning to the Dao.
The second demonstrates how to subdue the initial deluded mind—
this is the safeguard against sin.
The third warns against trivializing the words of the sages,
to aid those who seek cultivation.

**First: Action Does Not Contradict Stillness—The Method of Returning to the Dao.**
The Dao’s nature is profound and subtle,
its essence and principle both serene.
The true gate is hidden and deep,
its traces elusive beyond sound and color.
In the boundless void of great confusion,
one may doubt and follow external influences,
yet such deeds shock the world and cannot endure.
How much better to act without acting,
to strike thunderous drums yet leave no sound,
to move beyond all measure!

Light promises and few trustworthy words,
excessive speech and inevitable exhaustion—
the sage faces no difficulty,
for in a single breath, all is achieved.
The *He Shangzi* ascended into the void,
rising a hundred zhang without fear.
Emperor Wen of Han awoke early,
his frugal halls and curtains brought prosperity to the state.
Emperor Qin of Qin fell into delusion,
his extravagant Alang Palace led to the nation’s destruction.
These words are heard in the ears—
should they not be heeded?

**Master Laozi** (老君) despises this superficial flurry,
urging gradual refinement instead.
Thus, one knows to respond to grievances with virtue,
for the most saintly sages discern the weight of great and small.
This is no idle talk.

To act without acting,
to do without doing,
to savor without savoring—
great or small, much or little,
one pardons grievances with virtue,
transcending the distinctions of acting or not acting,
of doing or not doing,
of savoring or not savoring.

○ **Imperial Commentary:**
*"To act without acting"* (為無為),
*"to do without doing"* (事無事),
and *"to savor without savoring"* (味無味)—
whether great or small, much or little,
one does not exceed one’s portion,
nor does one harbor resentment.
If one follows the senses and generates the mind,
transgressing boundaries and harming one’s nature,
then neither great nor small remains—
all become objects of grievance.
Now, having guarded one’s portion,
one preserves harmony through virtue.

○ **Imperial Commentary:**
*"To act"* (為) means to create and shape.
Those who cultivate the Dao practice *zuowang* (坐忘) and abandon desire,
their minds free from contrivance.
Whatever they set in motion,
their deeds and transformations are effortless—
thus, *"without acting"* (無為).
This clarifies the mind.

They are not hindered by affairs,
so *"without doing"* (無事) in matters—
this clarifies the body.

They do not linger in tastes,
so *"without savoring"* (無味) in flavors—
this clarifies the tongue.

When the three actions are still,
the six senses naturally cease.
Thus, *"without acting"* (無為),
*"without doing"* (無事),
and *"without savoring"* (無味).

○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**
*"To act without acting"*—
one refines cultivation, hence creates nothing.
*"To do without doing"*—
one prepares in advance,
removing distractions and simplifying affairs.

「Without savoring, one delves into profound contemplation and distant foresight, thus discerning the Dao and its intent.

○ **Master Rong says:**
To still the restless agitation,
to concentrate the spirit in tranquility,
to sever entanglements of affairs,
to empty oneself in naturalness,
and to abandon cravings,
lingering in the ineffable and mysterious.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:**
*"To act without acting"*—
one attains subtle accord with the heart’s origin,
not losing the true reflection,
and the reflection penetrates all deeds—
thus, *"to act without acting"* is also *"to act without acting"* (無為則為，為則無為).
*"To do without doing"*—
affairs refer to all sensory and material realms,
the myriad things.
One attains the subtle essence of the true Dao,
and the reflection does not stray from emptiness—
though one engages in affairs,
one remains in *having-in-emptiness* (有體空),
internally reflecting while without the mind,
externally engaging while without affairs.

*"Without savoring"*—
to savor means to be stained and attached.
When both root and dust (尘) are empty,
and the faculties and objects are quiescent,
though one still seeks attachment,
there is no clinging.

Great and small, much and little,
one repays resentment with virtue.

○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**
Great and small, much and little—
these are the precepts and prohibitions laid out.
Desire great, it turns to small;
desire much, it turns to little—
this is the natural Dao.
To repay resentment with virtue—
to cultivate the Dao and practice goodness,
cutting off calamities before they arise.

○ **Master Rong says:**
Resentment arises,
sometimes great, sometimes small.
Hatred springs forth,
now few, now many.
When one enters realms of affairs,
one is ensnared by burdens,
and resentment begets resentment,
endless in its cycle.
If one returns to the great Dao of *without acting*,
preserving the naturalness of *without burden*,
discarding all that is turbid and mixed,
savoring this purity and emptiness,
then blame does not arise,
and resentment and enmity do not take root—
this is to repay resentment with virtue.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:**
Resentment—
the fault and its counterpart.
Repayment—
to settle with enmity.
From beginningless time onward,
great and small faults,
many and few deeds—
to utterly extinguish them all
and repay with a single act of completion,
one must first apply the three virtues of *without acting*, *without doing*, and *without savoring*
to observe the mind.
Then the Three Worlds are empty,
all dharmas pure and clear,
subject and object merge in obscurity—
what counterpart remains?
Thus, the previous chapter says:
*"Is there any fault that cannot be freed?"*
This is what it means.

The second precept clarifies the taming of the initial heart,
which is the defense against faults.
To forestall difficulty at its ease,
to make greatness from the small.
○ **Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:**
Those who indulge in emotions and desires
find no deed without difficulty,
no affair without greatness.
Now, if one seeks to overcome these difficulties,
to prepare for greatness,
one must do so when nature is still undispersed,
and the boundaries are yet uncrossed—
then one finds ease in the small.

○ **Master He Shang Gong’s commentary:**
To forestall—
to measure and overcome.
To prepare—
to undertake.
Emotional desires harm nature,
all arising gradually.
There is no deed that does not begin in ease
and end in difficulty,
no affair that does not start small
and grow great.
If one seeks to overcome difficulty
when it has already become difficult,
or to prepare for greatness
when it has already become great,
then calamities have already taken form—
even if one strives to overcome or prepare,
it will be of no benefit to the affliction.

○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**
To forestall difficulty at its ease—
when one seeks to overcome difficult matters,
one must act before they reach their ease, before they become fully formed.
To prepare greatness from the small—
when one seeks to undertake great affairs,
one must first avert the small calamities.
For great evils arise from small.

○ **Master Rong says:**
To forestall difficulty at its ease,
to prepare greatness from the small—
the world’s difficult affairs also arise from ease,
and great affairs also arise from small.
To arise—
to emerge.
Affairs emerge,
from ease they become difficult,
from small they grow great.
To remove evil retribution,
one must first still the initial heart.
To eliminate great evils,
one must first break them at their small beginnings—
if the roots are cut,
the branches and leaves will naturally wither.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:**
To forestall difficulty at its ease—
to forestall means to plan and overcome.
Difficulty—
the retribution of faults.
Ease—
the initial heart.
To plan and overcome the hardships of evil paths,
one must observe the initial heart—
when the heart is without contrivance,
then there is no retribution.
To prepare greatness from the small—
small means minute.
To create great calamities,
one must first attend to the trivial.
This clarifies that to extinguish evil fruits,
one must first dispel their causes.

The world’s difficult affairs must arise from ease.
The world’s great affairs must arise from small.
○ **Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:**
This elucidates the reason for the earlier admonition to plan and prepare.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:**
To arise—
to emerge.
This reiterates the source of the earlier calamities and difficulties—
difficult affairs emerge from ease,
so one must plan to overcome them while they are still easy.
Great affairs also emerge from small,
so one must eliminate them while they are still small.
The instances are endless,
so they are summarized below.

○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**
Modesty in conduct.

○ **Master Cheng’s commentary:**
To arise—
to emerge.
The world’s hardships and retributions of faults
must all emerge from the initial heart—
a single thought of the initial heart
can create immense deeds.
Thus, one must carefully consider:
great calamities arise from small beginnings,
from subtle to manifest,
gradually forming vast burdens.
Therefore, to remove evil retribution,
one must first restrain the initial heart.

The third precept warns against casually invoking sacred teachings,
lest they hinder those who seek cultivation.
Thus, the Sage never undertakes greatness,
and so is able to achieve greatness.
○ **Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:**
Since it is said that great affairs arise from small,
this explains why the Sage can achieve greatness—
by not undertaking difficult or great affairs,
the Sage attains their true grandeur.

○ **Master He Shang Gong’s commentary:**
The earlier passage shows that ordinary people,
when they undertake difficult or great affairs,
often fail and face many calamities.
Thus, the Sage never undertakes difficult or great affairs,
and so is able to achieve true grandeur.

○ **Master He Shang Gong says:**
The world unites in this.

「Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:
To make light promises and grant them to others,
one must necessarily lack in trustworthiness.
To act hastily and without restraint,
one will inevitably face many difficulties later.

○ Master He Shang Gong’s commentary:
This serves as a concluding metaphor.
He who does not deliberate three times before speaking,
who makes light and hasty promises,
lacks loyalty and sincerity.
He who does not plan the beginning yet is cautious at the end,
who undertakes affairs with excessive ease,
will later give rise to difficulties and become burdened with calamities.

○ Master He Shang Gong says:
To make light promises is to lack trustworthiness—
it is to take words lightly.
To act hastily is to invite many difficulties—
it is to fail in caution against misfortune.

○ Master Rong says:
Once a word is spoken, it must be kept true;
light promises are merely hollow.
Difficulties arise from what one undertakes,
and all sins and retributions in this life and the next
are made easy by such frivolity.
To engage in unrighteous deeds,
both beginning and end will bring hardship.

○ Master Cheng’s commentary:
To make light promises indeed leads to a lack of trustworthiness—
this is a metaphor of contrast.
*"诺"* (promise) means *"然许"* (to affirm and agree).
*"寡"* (lack) means *"少"* (few).
He who makes light and hasty promises to others
will necessarily be few in sincerity,
and thus failing in trustworthiness brings the blame of *"寡信"* (lacking trust).
To act hastily and affirm promises is also like
committing sins lightly, inviting the calamity of the *"八难"* (Eight Sufferings).
Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao must be steadfast,
never lighthearted.
Hence, the Sage finds even such matters difficult,
and so never encounters great difficulty.

○ Master He Shang Gong’s annotation:
Difficulties arise from light promises and hasty actions,
so the Sage never faces great difficulty.

○ Master He Shang Gong’s commentary:
The Sage is the ruler who embodies the Dao.
He finds even light promises and hasty actions difficult—
how much more so for those who are not Sages?
The Sage finds light promises and hasty actions difficult,
and so never encounters great difficulty.

○ Master He Shang Gong says:
Thus, the Sage finds even action and affairs difficult—
he weighs progress and retreat with great deliberation,
seeking to block the source of calamities,
and so never encounters great difficulty.
The Sage’s entire life is free from misfortune,
because he avoids harm with profound caution.

○ Master Rong says:
Lightly undertaking evil deeds,
acting without restraint invites sinful causes.
The Sage, being wise and discerning,
still finds even righteous action difficult,
and so attains both beginning and end without difficulty.
How much less can those who are blind and ignorant,
unable to weigh and be cautious,
hope to escape misfortune and calamity?

○ Master Cheng’s commentary:
*"犹"* (still) means *"尚"* (yet).
The Sage who embodies the Dao truly knows no difficulty or ease,
yet he still finds sinful deeds difficult to commit,
and so avoids blame for rashness.
How much more so for the common folk,
who indulge their emotions without restraint?

This is the concluding precept for the common cultivation of the Sage.
Hence, Guo Xiang’s annotation on the *Zhuangzi* states:
*"The Sage, though entering fire, does not feel its heat,
yet never steps into the fire."*
And again:
*"To keep far from fire is not to flee the heat—
this is the very meaning."*

*Dao De Jing: Xuan De Mu Chu* (Mysterious Virtue Commentary) Volume XVI concludes.
*Dao De Jing: Zuan Chu* (Compiled Commentary) Volume XVII ends.

**Chapter 64: *Its Ease in Holding Firm***

This chapter follows the previous one because, though the earlier passage clearly warns against the perils of sin, its guidance on practice remains incomplete. Thus, this chapter reiterates its meaning in four distinct ways: first, by teaching a method to subdue the initial mind; second, by offering an analogy to show how sin arises from subtle beginnings; third, by revealing how sentient beings, lost in delusion, stray from truth and lose their essence; and fourth, by citing the Sage’s example to demonstrate the path of learning.

**First Method: Subduing the Initial Mind**

The earth remains unmoving—its *virtue* of *Kun* brings enduring stillness,
Mountains and peaks stand firm—deep roots anchor them forever.

Those lost in the fourfold delusion’s realm,
About to wander the fivefold turbid crossroads—
None can match the ease of holding firm what is already settled,
For what is subtle may yet be scattered.

Just as a tree of ten *chi* grows from a hair’s tip,
And a nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth,
A thousand-*li* journey begins beneath the first step—
What is small must grow great.
Thus, the roots of sin deepen gradually,
And evil becomes transgression.
Like layered towers expanding ever wider,
One must clear away the darkness of ignorance
Before venturing into the Dao’s profound realm.
Do not be like Emperor Wu of Han, whose schemes failed,
Nor like one whose flesh is plentiful but marrow scarce,
Failing to uphold Laozi’s precepts.
A hollow belly and empty heart—
Even wild grass proves too much to tame,
Let alone the scattered currents of emotion and desire.
One must uproot them early,
Lest they spread unchecked,
And thus align with the natural order of all things,
In harmony with the Dao of eternal life.

**Its Ease in Holding Firm**
*Imperial Commentary*: "Its ease in holding firm" means "its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen." When a person’s true nature is serene and still, and one seeks to grasp and hold it—before desire even stirs, before its signs appear—one can plan to cut it off, ensuring it never arises. This is what is meant by "ease."

*Imperial Exegesis*: *An* (安) means *stillness*; *chi* (持) means *to grasp*. When a person’s innate nature is pure and untouched by external influences, yet stirred by sensory objects into boundless craving, now we clarify that in the moment before desire arises—when the mind is still and unscattered—it is easy to grasp and hold. Hence, *"its ease in holding firm."*

*River-Upper Master (严君平)*: Governing the body and the state—what is serene is easy to uphold.

*Li Rong* (李荣): *"Its ease in holding firm"* and *"its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen"*—*an* (安) means *stillness*; *wei zhao* (未兆) means *the stirrings have not yet formed*. It is difficult to stop calamity and evil once they manifest, but if one seeks to remove evil, one must act before it stirs. If one seeks to prevent disaster, one must hold firm in stillness. When evil’s signs have not yet appeared, there is no need to plot—disaster will not arise naturally. This is what is called the conduct of the superior sage in preventing calamity.

*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *An* (安) means *stillness*. For those cultivating the Dao, when the mind is tranquil and no thoughts have yet arisen, this is the most opportune time for cultivation and guard.

**Its Ease in Preventing What Has Not Yet Arisen**
*Imperial Exegesis*: *Zhao* (兆) means *sprouting, emerging*; *mou* (谋) means *to plan*. When desire is about to arise but has not yet taken form, planning to cut it off is also very easy. Hence, *"its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen."*

*River-Upper Master*: When the signs of desire and calamity have not yet appeared, it is easy to plan their cessation.

*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *Zhao* (兆) means *form, manifestation*; *mou* (谋) means *to devise*. Even if the mind has stirred but not yet grasped the object, and no form has yet appeared in the senses, one must immediately withdraw the mind to stillness. Since the deed has not yet been completed, it is easy to plan and consider.

**Its Fragility, Easy to Shatter**
*Imperial Commentary*: *"Its fragility, easy to shatter"* and *"its subtlety, easy to disperse"*—when desire first takes root, it is still weak and fragile. Those who can sever it find it easy to break, for when calamity first stirs, its signs are still faint. If one seeks to prevent it, its subtlety makes it easy to disperse.

*Imperial Exegesis*: When desire has already stirred but is still soft and not yet hardened, to remove it is easy to dissolve and break.

*River-Upper Master*: When calamity has not yet sprouted and desire has not yet taken form, it is like something fragile and easy to remove.

*Li Rong*: *"Its fragility, easy to shatter"* and *"its subtlety, easy to disperse"*—when sin is minor, it is easy to extinguish; when evil grows, it is hard to remove. If one cannot prevent it before it stirs, one must restrain it in its fragility and subtlety. This is the conduct of the middle sage in eliminating and dispersing evil.

*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *"Its fragility, easy to shatter"* and *"its subtlety, easy to disperse"*—*cui* (脆) means *hollow, like a gourd’s unripe fruit, soft and easy to break*. When the initial mind first stirs, it is just so: the karmic seeds are still shallow, hence easy to disperse.

**Its Subtlety, Easy to Disperse**
*Imperial Exegesis*: *Wei* (微) means *subtle*. When calamity first stirs faintly, before it grows great, preventing it at its origin makes it easy to disperse.

*River-Upper Master*: When the matter has not yet become apparent, what is subtle is easy to disperse.

**Act Before It Exists**
*Imperial Commentary*: The reason holding firm and preventing what has not yet arisen is easy is that one must cultivate and remove it *before* it takes form.

*Imperial Exegesis*: *Wei* (为) means *to cultivate and remove*. This sentence explains the two preceding ones—*"its ease in holding firm"* and *"its ease in preventing what has not yet arisen."* The meaning is: when desire has not yet arisen, one must cultivate and cut it off, ensuring evil does not take root. Hence, *"act before it exists."*

*River-Upper Master*: If one seeks to act, one must block its sprouting at the very beginning.

*Li Rong*: This is what is meant by *"its ease in holding firm."*

*Master Cheng’s Exegesis*: *Wei* (为) means *to cultivate and practice*. For those on the path, cultivation and guard must begin *before* defilement arises. This explains *"its ease in holding firm."*

**Prevent Before It Becomes Chaos**
*Imperial Commentary*: This follows *"its fragility, easy to shatter"* and *"its subtlety, easy to disperse."* The reason it is easy is that one must remove it *before* it becomes calamity and chaos.

*Imperial Exegesis*: This sentence explains the two preceding ones—*"its fragility, easy to shatter"* and *"its subtlety, easy to disperse."* The reason it is easy is that even if desire has arisen, it is still fragile and subtle, not yet having become calamity and chaos, hence easy to rectify.

「**River Master Cheng** said: In governing oneself and governing the realm, when chaos has not yet arisen, one must *preemptively close its gate*.

**Li Rong** said: This is what is meant by *"its fragility, easy to shatter."*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *Chaos* refers to the entanglement of afflictions—when one is already ensnared by karmic bonds, the mind becomes obscured and disordered. Now, though the mind may arise and be defiled by external objects, it has not yet reached the point where it must be addressed, making it easy to govern. This explains *"its subtlety, easy to disperse."*

**Prevent Before It Becomes Chaos**
**The Way of Rectification Begins in the Unmanifest**
**River Master Cheng** said: A tree thick enough to encircle with one’s arms begins as a tiny sprout; a nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth; a journey of a thousand *li* begins with a single step. This is what is meant by *"its ease in holding firm."*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The tree that grows to be encircled by arms originates from a single hair’s width of a sprout—this illustrates how the three paths of defilement arise from a single thought. The reason a tree is used as an analogy is that, from small to great, it can eventually block the sunlight, just as the defilement of the mind, from subtle to deep-rooted, can obscure one’s true nature. If one considers this tree as arising from emptiness—speaking of emptiness, the tree itself is not inherently existent—it is because the four dusts of sense perception do not solidify into form.

Afflictions, too, arise from emptiness—speaking of emptiness, they are not inherently existent. The nine-tiered tower rises from a single shovelful of earth—just as a tower of nine levels begins with a single basket of soil, so the calamity of the nine nights of suffering originates from a single defiled thought. This admonishes all learners to guard against negligence with utmost caution.

A peak a hundred *ren* high begins with a single step—since seven *chi* make one *ren*, a mountain peak a hundred *ren* tall starts from the first step. The suffering of the eightfold path arises from the defilement of the mind. The analogy of the nine-tiered tower illustrates that afflictions have already taken root, while the hundred *ren* peak further warns that even greater calamity awaits if the defilement continues unchecked.

**The Third Analogy Clarifies the Delusion of Sentient Beings**
**Those Who Act Are Doomed to Fail; Those Who Cling Are Doomed to Lose**
**River Master Cheng** said: Those who act are doomed to fail—if one acts upon external matters, one abandons natural spontaneity; if one acts upon moral principles, one abandons virtue; if one acts upon sensory pleasures, one abandons clarity of mind.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The supreme Dao is void and profound, requiring neither action nor attachment. Yet ordinary minds are inverted, clinging to action and attachment, which bring peril and ruin. Hence, it is said that *"those who act are doomed to fail"*—because attachment goes against reality, it is said that *"those who cling are doomed to lose."*

**The Fourth Section Cites the Sage to Validate the Teaching**
Thus, the Sage acts without doing (*wuwei*), hence there is no failure; the Sage does not cling, hence there is no loss.

**The Sage’s Natural Way**
**River Master Cheng** said: The Sage acts without doing (*wuwei*), hence there is no failure. The Sage does not adorn with empty rhetoric, hence there is no failure. The Sage does not indulge in sensory pleasures, hence there is no depletion. The Sage does not cling, hence there is no loss. The Sage possesses virtue to teach the foolish and wealth to aid the poor, yet retains nothing for oneself, hence there is nothing lost to others.

**Li Rong** said: Ordinary people are blind to immediate matters, hence they incur failures and losses. The Sage, however, perceives the unseen before its manifestation and thus avoids the perils of action.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The Sage embodies the Dao and acts without doing (*wuwei*), hence there is no obstruction or failure. The Sage does not cling to illusions, hence does not lose their true nature. Ordinary people, when engaging in good deeds, often falter when success is near—greedy for status, fond of reputation, indulgent in luxury, and complacent in abundance—thus bringing ruin upon themselves.

**River Master Cheng** said: *From* (从) means *to act* (为). When ordinary people pursue affairs, they often nearly achieve their moral merits but then, through greed for position and love of fame, through extravagance and arrogance, through indulgence and fullness, bring ruin upon themselves.

「**Master Róng** said: *几* (near) means *near completion*. Ordinary people, when doing evil, cannot remove it early; when evil deeds are nearly complete, they naturally self-destruct. If one could align with the Sage, abandoning danger and seeking safety, they would never commit wrongdoing, nor incur blame, and thus would neither gain nor lose—what ruin or success could there be?

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *几* (near) means *near completion*. Ordinary people cling to affairs of action (*youwei*), their minds restless and competitive, clinging to distinctions and grasping at gains—utterly lacking foresight. They always wish for near completion, yet have beginnings without endings, hence their frequent failures. The *Book of Songs* says: *"None lack a beginning, few attain to the end."* To be cautious at the end as at the start ensures no ruinous affairs.

**Imperial Commentary**: To be cautious at the end as at the start, maintaining unwavering constancy, then there will be no failed undertakings.

**Imperial Exegesis**: This is the Elder Master’s reiteration of his admonition. If a person can be cautious at the end as at the beginning, steadfast from start to finish, then there will be no failed undertakings.

**River Master Cheng** said: The end should be like the beginning; one must not slacken.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: This admonishes studious people to fortify their resolve, maintaining steadfastness from start to finish—how could there be failure? Among the Six Perfections (*liùdù*), this is the fourth: *renunciation* (*zìxìng*). Hence, the Sage desires not to desire, and does not value difficult-to-obtain wealth.

**Imperial Commentary**: Difficult-to-obtain wealth refers to what lies beyond one’s natural inclinations. Now, the Sage, in not desiring to desire, does not pursue what is beyond their nature, always preserving their spontaneity—this is not valuing difficult-to-obtain wealth.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: This illustrates the Sage’s conduct to repudiate the common. Difficult-to-obtain wealth—internally refers to what is beyond one’s natural inclinations, externally refers to pearls, rhinoceros horns, and treasures. The Sage, in not desiring to desire, neither internally pursues what is beyond their nature nor externally seeks wealth that burdens their virtue.

**River Master Cheng** said: Hence, the Sage desires not to desire: the Sage desires what others do not desire—others seek fame and display, the Sage desires obscurity; others desire ornamentation, the Sage desires simplicity; others value outward appearance, the Sage values inner virtue. The Sage does not covet difficult-to-obtain wealth, hence does not dazzle with gaudy attire nor demean stone while venerating jade.

**Master Róng** said: Hence, the Sage desires not to desire, not valuing difficult-to-obtain wealth; they study without studying, anticipating the faults of others. Ordinary emotions follow desires, demeaning the Dao while valuing wealth. The Sage is not greedy, cherishing truth while lightly esteeming treasures. If one cultivates not for self but for others, studies not for personal gain but for the benefit of others, then avarice brings misfortune, and striving for fame invites censure. The Sage, without desire, abandons worldly gain; ceasing study, they forget fame. They do not flaunt their own abilities but guard against the faults of others.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: Hence, the Sage desires not to desire, not valuing difficult-to-obtain wealth; they study without studying, correcting the faults of others. The Sage’s illumination comes from the heavens, differing from common wisdom; they perceive all phenomena as empty and illusory, seeing no objects worth praising. Thus, within desire, they do not perceive desire’s form—since they do not desire to desire, why would they value jade and silk?

Again, they grasp the truth of reality without distinction, hence they forget study. To study is not to study; not to study is to study. Studying differs from not studying; not studying differs from studying. Hence the *Sūtra of the Western Ascension* (*Xīshēng Jīng*) says: *"My learning has no learning; only then can I illuminate nature."*

To anticipate, means to prevent. Ordinary people cling rigidly to affairs of action, unable to forget study, hence the Sage speaks of "studying without studying" to prevent the faults of all beings.

**Imperial Commentary**: "Studying without studying" corrects the faults of others, aiding the spontaneous nature of all things without daring to act. The Sage does not seek excessive learning, hence in "studying without studying," they aim to return others’ excessive learning to its roots, aiding nature’s inherent essence, thus not daring to indulge in worldly desires or common studies.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: The common folk value difficult-to-obtain wealth, hence they feign cleverness and flaunt their attainments, studying what lies beyond their natural inclinations. The Sage does not seek excessive learning, always preserving nature’s inherent essence—this is "studying without studying," returning others’ excessive learning to its roots.

**River Master Cheng** said: "Studying without studying"—the Sage studies what others cannot study. Others study deceit and cunning; the Sage studies nature. Others study governance of the world; the Sage studies self-cultivation, guarding the true Dao.

To correct the faults of others—ordinary people study what is superficial, taking the end as the beginning. The superficial is indeed the ornament. To correct means to return to the root.

To aid the spontaneous nature of all things without daring to act—

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: To aid means to assist and guide. Nature is the inherent essence of things. All beings, deluded and misguided, lose their original essence. The Sage, with compassionate persuasion, encourages study without action, intending to assist and guide the true nature of things. Thus, they do not dare to act in worldly studies or excessive desires.

**River Master Cheng** said: To aid the spontaneous nature of all things, teaching people to return to reality—this is to assist the inherent essence of all things. Yet they do not dare to act. The Sage’s movements follow naturally, never daring to contrive, lest they stray from the root.

**Master Róng** said: The nature of things is rooted in spontaneity. Desires corrupt with attachment, burdening truth; study obstructs with distinctions, hindering the Dao. Thus, the source of unity is obscured, and the true nature of the Way becomes difficult to discern. Without entering *wuwei*, one only returns to ruin. The Sage follows nature’s inherent essence, aids all things to preserve truth, never daring to act in contrived affairs, guiding them to return to emptiness and stillness.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: To aid means to assist and guide. All beings inherently possess nature’s upright essence, yet they are deluded and misguided, losing the Dao and abandoning truth. Now, the Sage seeks to uphold the method of "studying without studying," guiding them to return to their roots. Though the Sage exhausts principles and fathoms nature, they also act without contrivance and without failing to act.»

「Now, when it is said that the Sage does not act, it is because they also wish to assist and guide the multitude, restoring them to nature’s inherent essence. Hence, they say, *"do not dare to act."*

**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Sage’s Skill in the Dao**
The reason for this chapter’s sequence after the previous is that the prior chapter spoke of the Sage abandoning study yet still able to assist and guide all beings. Therefore, this chapter follows to reveal those who practice study and engage in beneficent deeds—within this chapter, its meaning unfolds in three distinctions:
1) To cite antiquity and validate the present, employing eloquent discourse to clarify;
2) To discern excellence and mediocrity, setting forth models for emulation;
3) To invert convention and align with truth, demonstrating its profound allure.

1) **Citing Antiquity and Validating the Present, Employing Eloquent Discourse to Clarify**
The Dao’s profound origin is subtle, its mysteries reaching the utmost purity. It eludes the ears and eyes, rendering perception and hearing as ineffectual as those of a fool. Confucius uncovered it yet remained unaware, Yan Hui conversed with it yet failed to grasp. Thus, governing with wisdom is like the harm of thieves and bandits; cultivating the Dao with *wuwei* allows each to attain their own fulfillment. Is not this the standard form?

Then one understands that the true source of emptiness and purity, its principles penetrating beyond tranquil oblivion, the profound mystery of the *Chongxuan* (重玄), transcends the causes of mere non-existence. It is not something that can be imparted through mere exposition, nor is it within the grasp of those lost in error. The affairs of human conduct are indeed perilous, hence it is said:
*"When the ditch of Cao Gou was dug, the people were enslaved;
When Qin’s wealth was prized, its lineage fell into ruin.
Soaring before gathering, the phoenix calls from the high ridges;
Rushing yet not flying, the magpie withdraws to distant paths.
Acting against the natural order leads to loss,
Departing from the Dao leads to destruction.
If one can reverse their conduct with things,
Then they grasp the principle of great harmony."*

**The Sage’s Skill in the Dao Lies Not in Enlightening the People, But in Making Them Seem Foolish**
**Master He’s Commentary**: The ancient Sage-rulers, skilled in the Dao, valued *wuwei* and tranquil simplicity—not flaunting their methods to enlighten the people, but guiding them toward purity, closing off their cleverness to restore them to their original simplicity, making them appear as foolish as they truly were.

**Master He’s Exegesis**: The ancient Sage-rulers, who excelled in using the Dao for transformation, prized *wuwei* and tranquil simplicity. They did not display their methods to enlighten the people, lest cleverness and deceit flourish, but instead led them to purity and simplicity, making them appear as though they were foolish.

**Master He Shangong said**: The ancient Sage-rulers, skilled in the Dao, spoke of those who used the Dao to cultivate their own bodies and govern their states. They did not enlighten the people with the Dao, nor did they teach them with cleverness, lest they become deceptive and cunning. Instead, they sought to make the people appear simple and unassuming, free from deceit and artifice.

**Master Yan said**: The ancient Sage-rulers, guarding their own simplicity, made their subjects return to natural purity. Without resorting to coercive laws or punishments, the people naturally conformed to transformation. If they did not practice the Dao of emptiness and stillness, but instead relied solely on cunning and cleverness, the more intelligence there was, the greater the chaos. Hence, they were difficult to govern.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *治* (govern) is the same as *理* (transform). *智* (wisdom) refers to distinctions and discernments. The reason all beings are difficult to transform is that their minds are too occupied with distinctions, unable to embrace emptiness and stillness. Hence, they are hard to guide.

2) **Discerning Excellence and Mediocrity, Setting Forth Models for Emulation**
Thus, governing with wisdom is the thief of the state.
**Master He’s Commentary**: *以* (to use) means to employ. When a ruler appoints clever and wise ministers to govern the state, their cleverness will inevitably lead to the creation of laws, and laws will breed deceit. Hence, it is said that wisdom is the thief of the state.

**Master He’s Exegesis**: *以* (to use) means to employ. *贼* (thief) refers to harm. When a ruler employs ministers who are cunning and deceitful to govern the state, their cleverness will give rise to schemes and stratagems. Once these schemes are put into use, falsehood and artifice will flourish, and the Dao will be abandoned, causing harm to the state. Hence, it is said that wisdom is the thief of the state.

**Master He Shangong said**: If clever and wise individuals are entrusted with governing the state, they will inevitably stray from the Dao, arbitrarily imposing rewards and punishments, becoming the thieves of the state.

**Master Yan said**: Thus, governing with wisdom is the thief of the state. Not governing with wisdom is the virtue of the state. Cleverness and cunning deeply harm the people, making wisdom the thief of the state. Pure simplicity without cleverness, letting things transform naturally, each attending to their own affairs, the people finding joy in their lives and families secure, harming neither others nor themselves, ruler and subjects both at ease—this is the virtue of the state.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: Thus, governing with wisdom is the thief of the state; not governing with wisdom is the virtue of the state. If one uses penetrating insight to govern with cleverness, they deviate from natural harmony and align with harm like a thief. The former is reversed, the latter is harmonious—how can such discourse be considered similar?

**Response**:
The earlier statement of "reversed" means that it is not reversed but instead is truly reversed. The later statement of "harmonious" also means it is not harmonious but truly harmonious. If it is truly harmonious, it does not deviate from the reversed; if it is truly reversed, it does not deviate from the harmonious. What then is there to object to?»

「The Sage asks: The Classic speaks of *Great Harmony*—does harmony also have degrees of greatness and smallness?

The Master responds: When harmony is opposed to defiance, it may be small. But now, neither defying nor harmonizing, yet it is called *not* harmonious—harmony does not differ from defiance, nor does defiance oppose harmony. Thus, the Classic speaks in silence, following only the Dao, blending with the light and merging with the dust, ever abiding in harmony with principle. Whether harmony or non-harmony, non-harmony or harmony, all are simultaneously harmonious. Hence, there is neither harmony nor non-harmony, nor is there a lack of harmony while still being able to lack non-harmony, nor even a negation of non-harmony—this is why it is called *Great Harmony*.

**Chapter Sixty-Six of the *King of the Hundred Valleys***—
This chapter follows the previous one, which elucidates the *Mysterious Virtue* of the Sage, reversing the profane and aligning with the Dao. Thus, this chapter further expounds the practice of harmonizing with the Dao.

Within this chapter, three distinct teachings unfold:
1. **The Parable**—to demonstrate *emptiness and forgetfulness*,
2. **The Doctrine**—to illuminate *humility and retreat*,
3. **The Conclusion**—to praise the power of *softness and weakness*.

**1. The Parable—Demonstrating Emptiness and Forgetfulness**
The eastward-flowing rivers all converge and pay homage to the great sea. Spring gives rise to all things, each shaping itself naturally. Why, then, does the sea possess emptiness, and the rivers descend? The sea, though not empty, is the *King of the Hundred Valleys* because it abides in the low places.

The Sage uses this as an analogy: casting aside fame and desires, utterly forgetting right and wrong, embracing the multitude with boundless ease, illuminating the minute dust within the mind’s breadth—all actions are humble, all positions are yielding. Thus, the people and the heavens rejoice in their adoration, who could dare to contend?

A lingering presence in the rear is not a boast of prowess; a snake’s foot, when added, spoils the whole. Yet if one were to snatch the wine first, they would know the *Mysterious Extremes* operate in secrecy. The Sage’s enduring stillness and retreat bring constant ease, while *firm and white* arguments are but empty noise—those who are blind to the end shall never comprehend.

**Shared Work**—what strength did he possess? He shattered the Heavenly Pillar and brought calamity upon himself. **The Qin Emperor**—what folly did he commit? He pierced the earth for markets and invited disaster. Unable to embrace softness and enlighten the distant, they grew rigid and harsh—how could they know that their realm would crumble, their kin perish, their lives extinguished, and the world delivered into the hands of common men? Such is their dire fate.

As **Yang Xiong** said: This is because they did not practice emptiness.

The sea is able to be the *King of the Hundred Valleys* because it excels in descending. Hence, the sea abides in low places, and all rivers pay homage to it, just as people flock to their king.

**Master He’s Commentary**: The sea is able to command the rivers to converge and pay homage because it excels in dwelling in the lowest places, governing the currents.

**Master He’s Exegesis**: The sea, by dwelling in the lowest places, becomes the *King of the Hundred Valleys* to which all rivers pay homage. Thus, the *I Ching* says: *"The Earthly Dao transforms fullness into flowing humility."* This is the parable given.

The Earthly Dao, through humility, receives the rivers’ tribute. The Sage, through humility, draws the people’s devotion—none weary of approaching.

**Master He Shang Gong** says: The sea is able to be the *King of the Hundred Valleys* because it excels in descending. Thus, the sea, through its lowliness, becomes the gathering place of all rivers. Just as people flock to their king, so the rivers pay homage to the sea. The sea’s ability to be the *King of the Hundred Valleys* is due to its lowliness.

**Master Rong** says: This parable shows that the sea, by dwelling in low places, becomes the *King of the Hundred Valleys*, illustrating that the Sage’s humility makes them the sovereign of all under Heaven.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis**: *King* means *direction*. The *Hundred Valleys* are like the *Hundred Rivers*. The sea is called the *King of the Hundred Rivers* because it dwells in the low, sunken places. If a person retreats in body and humbles in speech, empties themselves and yields to all, they too shall be the refuge of the common folk—thus they become the *King of the Hundred Valleys*.

This concludes the parable’s meaning, hence the Classic says: *"The sea is the King of the Hundred Rivers."*

**2. The Doctrine—Illuminating Humility and Retreat**
Thus, the Sage desires to be above others by first humbling their speech.

**Master He’s Commentary**: The Sage, desiring to be above others, humbles their speech. Desiring to precede others, they retreat their own body. Hence, though they occupy the highest position, others do not feel burdened; though they stand at the forefront, others do not suffer harm. Humility is the handle of virtue—when one uses it, its brilliance only grows. By humbling their speech, the people joyfully submit; by retreating their body, the people willingly approach. Thus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not feel burdened; though they stand at the forefront, others do not suffer harm.

**Master He’s Exegesis**: This combines the parable. The Sage, desiring to be above others, humbles their speech. Does the Sage truly wish to dwell above others while humbling their speech? No—only the Sage knows that fullness invites loss, so they speak in humility and yield in name, descending below all things. Yet their vast virtue and grand achievements naturally elevate them above others.

**Master He Shang Gong** says: The Sage, desiring to be above others, seeks to stand above the people. By humbling their speech, they follow the sea’s example, dwelling in humility.

**Master Rong** says: The Sage, desiring to be above the people, humbles their speech. Desiring to precede the people, they retreat their body. Thus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not feel burdened; though they stand at the forefront, the people do not suffer harm. By dwelling humbly beneath all, their virtue draws them upward. By retreating to let others pass, their embrace of the Dao renders them without desire or action—utterly empty, utterly still, forgetting the heart and casting aside cleverness, corpse-like in silent mystery. Such is the governance of the world by the *Highest Virtue*.

By this standard, superiority and inferiority become evident. If governing the state is thus, then so too should one’s personal conduct be. Not governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.

**Master He’s Commentary**: If the ruler does not employ cunning ministers but instead seeks those of pure virtue, allowing them to rest in the Dao of non-action and practice the *Great Simplicity*, the natural harmony will flourish, and this is the state’s blessing.

**Master He’s Exegesis**: The ruler, not entrusting themselves to cunning ministers but seeking those of pure virtue, sits in the Dao of non-action and walks in the *Great Simplicity*, achieving harmony and ease—this is the state’s blessing.»

**Master He (Riverbank Master) says:**
If one does not allow the wise and clever to govern the state’s affairs, then the people will uphold uprightness, not indulging in deceit. The ruler and subjects will be close, and the sovereign and ministers will act in concert—this is the state’s blessing. Knowing these two principles is also the standard.

**Master He’s Commentary:**
To employ cunning ministers brings harm to the people, while to entrust oneself to those of pure virtue brings blessing to the state. If the ruler knows these two principles and delegates to ministers of pure virtue, this becomes the standard and model.

**Master He’s Exegesis:**
The two principles refer to using wisdom and not using wisdom. The standard is the model, the law is the method. The ruler knows that using wisdom is like a thief, while not using it brings blessing—thus one must remove the thief and take the blessing. Only then can they be the standard and model for governing the state.

**Master He (Riverbank Master) says:**
The two principles refer to wisdom and lack of wisdom. Those who habitually know wisdom as a thief and lack of wisdom as a blessing are the standard and model for both personal cultivation and governing the state.

**Master Rong says:**
Knowing these two principles is also the standard. Habitually knowing the standard is called *Highest Virtue*. *Highest Virtue* is profound and far-reaching, contrary to all things, and only then does one attain the *Great Order*.

Using wisdom or not using wisdom—these are the two. Using it brings harm; not using it brings no injury. If one knows that the people suffer no harm when not using wisdom, then one knows the standard and model for governing the state. Knowing the standard and model, one’s foundation is firm and the realm secure—this is the subtlety of virtue.

The subtlety of virtue is unfathomable and deepens daily; its pursuit is boundless and distant. All men use wisdom, yet this one alone uses simplicity, for he is contrary to all things.

Not opposing the nature of things, but letting them unfold naturally—this is the *Great Order*.

It is also said that the Dao is originally empty and mysterious, while the worldly ways are coarse and defiled. To conform to the world and seek the Dao is to lose the true; to oppose the world and cultivate virtue is to enter the subtle. Entering the subtle, there is neither "can" nor "cannot"; returning to the true, there is neither "blocked" nor "unblocked." Since its response is boundless and formless, it attains the *Great Order* and equality.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
The two principles refer to the earlier discussion of wisdom and lack of wisdom. Those who use wisdom as a thief and lack of wisdom as virtue can serve as the standard for personal cultivation and the grand principles for governing the state. Habitually knowing the standard is called *Highest Virtue*.

**Master He’s Commentary:**
*Highest Virtue* is profound, subtle, and far-reaching. The ruler who habitually knows these two principles as the standard and model possesses the profound and mysterious subtlety of virtue.

**Master He (Riverbank Master) says:**
*Highest Virtue* is profound and far-reaching. The person of *Highest Virtue* is profound beyond measure and distant beyond reach. Contrary to all things, the person of *Highest Virtue* opposes the world’s inclination to benefit oneself, instead desiring to aid others. Only then does one attain the *Great Order*, which aligns with the natural Way of Heaven.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*Highest Virtue* is profound and far-reaching, contrary to the world—this is called *Highest Virtue*. To exhaust the source and reach the utmost is called profound and far-reaching. The profound and far-reaching wisdom is contrary to worldly ways, hence one is contrary to all things. Only then does one attain the *Great Order*, which has two forms: one, aligning with the natural principles; two, conforming to worldly affairs. The former harmonizes with the subtle source; the latter descends with the dust.

**Question:** Earlier it says "contrary to things," yet later it says "aligning with worldly ways." If the text first says "contrary" and then "aligning," how can they be consistent?

**Answer:** The earlier "contrary" means contrary without being contrary; the later "aligning" means aligning without being aligning. Aligning without deviating from the contrary, and being contrary without breaking from alignment—what is there to object to?

**Question:** The scripture speaks of *Great Order*—does "order" also have degrees of greatness and smallness?

**Answer:** When "order" is contrasted with "disorder," even if it is small, here it is neither aligning nor disordering, yet called "not aligning." Aligning does not differ from disordering, nor does disordering conflict with aligning. Thus, in silent repose, one follows only the Dao, blending light with dust, and ever aligns with the natural principles. Whether called aligning or not aligning, not aligning or aligning, aligning or not aligning—all are aligning in their own time. Hence there is no aligning nor non-aligning, no non-aligning yet able to be non-aligning, nor is there a negation of non-aligning—this is why it is called *Great Order*.

**Chapter 66: The King of All Valleys (江海为百谷王)**
This chapter follows the previous one, which expounded the person of *Highest Virtue*, contrary to the world yet aligning with the Dao. Thus, this chapter further displays the practice of aligning with the Dao.

Within this chapter, three themes unfold: first, an analogy to illustrate *emptiness-forgetting*; second, a teaching to demonstrate *humility-retreat*; third, a concluding reflection on the power of gentleness.

**First: An Analogy to Illustrate *Emptiness-forgetting***
The eastern rivers all flow toward the sea, converging in their reverence for the great waters. In spring, all things arise, each taking shape in the natural Way. Why is it that the natural Way can be empty, and the great sea can be humble, so that the rivers may become its king?

The sage uses this as a metaphor: great dismissal of sounds and colors, complete forgetting of right and wrong. Welcoming the multitude with boundless harmony, illuminating the fine dust within the heart—wherever one goes, one is humble; wherever one stands, one is gentle and lowly. Then Heaven and man gladly acclaim, and who can dispute it?

**First: An Analogy to Illustrate *Emptiness-forgetting***
The body, though placed behind, should not boast of its merit—like a serpent’s tail, it comes too late. When one seizes the wine and turns it upside down, one understands the profound subtleties of the Dao’s operations. In stillness and retreat, one finds enduring peace; the *firm-and-white* paradox is but idle chatter, and the mysteries of the end remain forever obscure.

What power did Gonggong possess? He shattered the Heavenly Pillar and left ruin behind. What folly did the Qin Emperor exhibit? He pierced the earth for profit and invited disaster. Unable to embrace gentleness and illuminate the distant, they grew rigid and harsh. How could they know that their nation would crumble, their family perish, their bodies slaughtered, and their kin extinguished—casting the world into the hands of common men, how bitter their fate!

As Yang Xiong said, *"It is not empty indeed."*

The reason the rivers and seas can reign as sovereigns over all valleys is that they excel in humility. Thus, the rivers and seas, through their lowly submission, become the *tributaries’ king*.

**Annotations:**
- *Emptiness-forgetting* (虚忘) / *humility-retreat* (谦退) / *firm-and-white* (坚白) / *tributaries’ king* (百谷王)

**Second: A Teaching to Demonstrate *Humility-retreat***
Therefore, the sage wishes to rise above others by speaking in humility. **Annotations:** *Humility-retreat* (谦退)

The *Commentary of the Master of the Riverbank* explains: Thus, the sage seeks to ascend above others by speaking in humility, and to lead them by placing himself behind. Hence, though he holds the highest position, others do not grow weary of him; though he stands at the forefront, none dare harm him. Humility is the handle of virtue, and nobility shines ever brighter. By speaking in humility, the people willingly follow, so he is not seen as burdensome in his elevation. By retreating in body, the people come as children, so he is not seen as a threat in his advance.

**Annotations:**
- *Master of the Riverbank* (河上公) / *handle of virtue* (德柄) / *nobility* (尊) / *bright* (光)

The *Grand Commentary* states: The sage does not truly wish to be above others; he merely embodies humility, placing himself behind while others advance. Thus, they naturally honor him as their leader.

The *Commentary of the Master of the Riverbank* further says: To rise above the people, the sage speaks in humility, following the model of the rivers and seas, dwelling in modesty.

Yang Xiong adds: Thus, the sage seeks to ascend above the people by speaking in humility, and to lead them by placing himself behind. Hence, though he holds the highest position, the people do not grow weary; though he stands at the forefront, the people are not harmed. He dwells beneath others with humility, yet his virtue earns him their elevation. He retreats in person to benefit others, yet his embrace of the Dao secures his revered place. The people willingly follow without feeling burdened, all loyal and filial—who would dare harm him?

The *Grand Commentary* elaborates: Though the sage stands above, the people do not grow weary because he is tranquil, unassuming, and free from excessive thought or desire. Thus, he governs as their ruler, easing their burdens and taxes so they labor lightly. Another interpretation: The sage’s benevolence extends to all things, so the people bear his rule without complaint.

Though he stands at the forefront, the people are not harmed. As their sovereign, he places himself before them, yet they sing and strike the earth in joy, the world at peace. His benefits are vast and abundant, without harm. Another interpretation: The sage’s virtue is boundless, the people gladly acclaim him, cherishing his grace—how could they dare harm him?

**Third: A Concluding Reflection on the Power of Gentleness**
Thus, the world willingly honors him without growing weary.

**Commentary on the Gentle Sovereign’s Authority**
Because of his refusal to burden or harm, the world’s people willingly acclaim him as their sovereign without tiring.

**Explanatory Elucidation:**
The Sage’s virtue is vast and boundless, nurturing all things like spring’s warmth, shining forth like the sun. Since he neither burdens nor harms, the people joyfully acclaim him without tiring.

**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**
The Sage’s kindness is profound and his love vast—he regards the people as his own children. Thus, the world willingly unites to honor him as sovereign, none wearying of him.

**Master Rong’s Reflection:**
Therefore, the world rejoices in acclaiming him without tiring, for he does not contend. Thus, none can contend with him. Those without virtue are universally despised, but those who embody the Way are all gladly honored. Practicing humility and yielding, he aligns with the transformations of all things—who would dare to contend with him?

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Therefore, the world rejoices in acclaiming him without tiring, for he does not contend. Thus, none can contend with him. The reason the people gladly honor him as their sovereign without tiring is that he is ever modest and yielding, never contending with others. Having abandoned strife and embraced equality, all distinctions of right and wrong cease—who would dare to contend with one who does not contend? Thus, none can contend with him. Because he does not contend, none can contend with him.

**Commentary on the Sage’s Humility:**
The Sage is modest and retiring, not contending with others, so the world unites to honor him—who would dare to contend?

**Explanatory Elucidation:**
The world rejoices in honoring the Sage without tiring, for his words place others above him, and his actions place himself behind them. Since he does not vie for precedence, none can contend with the Sage’s refusal to compete.

**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**
Because he does not contend, the world never tires of the Sage’s rule. This is because the Sage does not vie with others for precedence. Thus, none can contend with him. It is said that all people contend for action, but none contend with one who does not act.

**Chapter 67: On the Magnitude of the Dao**
This chapter follows the previous one, which expounded upon the Sage’s ability to be humble yet elevated. Thus, this chapter further elucidates his virtues and fully presents the Three Treasures.

Within this chapter, the meaning unfolds in five layers:
1. He does not boast, so he is vast and great.
2. He fully presents the Three Treasures, drawing all things to rely upon them.
3. He reiterates the Three Treasures, praising their efficacy.
4. He describes those who abandon the Three Treasures, sinking into death and life’s cycles.
5. He concludes with a grand eulogy to boundless compassion and unparalleled virtue.

**First Layer: He Does Not Boast, So He Is Vast and Great**
The profound and mysterious Dao originated before the Five Agents, and the subtle True Principle permeates the essence of the Original Harmony. Its form is vast, its virtue profound—transcending the laws of sensory desire and severing the boundaries of mundane perception. The common folk see only what is near, yet he does not defy the depths of the mysterious. Thus, though called "great," he seems unremarkable. How could they know that the Three Treasures dwell in stillness, the True Vehicle daring not to lead? He ever guards humility and frugality.

Even the sage-king Wen of Zhou, though wise, initially failed to grasp the Way of mutual benefit, and Emperor Wen of Han, though brilliant, did not comprehend the parable of the stacked firewood. How much less can the ordinary and vulgar, the coarse and mundane, fathom the profundity of the Mysterious Dao or grasp the depths of its Original Source? If they do not scorn it, how could it be called the Great Way?

The world says my Dao is great, yet it seems unremarkable.
**Commentary:** *Xiào* (似) means "to resemble."

**Explanatory Elucidation:**
The world deems my Dao vast and boundless, yet it seems to resemble nothing. Thus, the following passage responds to this.

**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**
The Old Master says the world considers my Dao great, yet I feign ignorance, appearing unremarkable.

**Master Rong’s Reflection:**
The world calls me great yet unremarkable. Only because it is great does it seem unremarkable. If it had long resembled something, it would be small indeed. The Old Master’s Dao is exalted in virtue and noble in power—truly worthy of being called great. Yet, he conceals his traces among the common, his presence hidden and inscrutable. He does not resemble the wise, nor does he resemble the foolish. Thus, he is called unremarkable.

*Not resembling* means lacking comparison. Only the greatest of sages has nothing to compare to. If form had fixed qualities, wisdom had constant measures, or the Dao had attainments, these would be the petty schemes of small-minded people—not the boundless communion of the great sage.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
The Old Master’s essence is naturally vast, his fruits perfectly realized, so the common folk universally revere him as the Great Sage. Why is this? Only because in dealing with others, he is modest and yielding, never boasting or scoffing. Thus, it is so.

Only because it is great does it seem unremarkable. If it had long resembled something, it would be small indeed.
**Commentary:** Only my Dao is supremely great, so it resembles nothing. If it were like the laws of past ages—having something to resemble—it would no longer be called great. It would have long been insignificant.

**Explanatory Elucidation:**
This explains why it seems unremarkable. Only because my Dao is vast and transcendent, beyond the grasp of ordinary perception, can it be called great. If it resembled anything—like the laws of past ages—it would lose its claim to greatness and become insignificant. These are petty, shallow teachings, no different from the common ways—how could they be called great?

*Ah!* (也夫) is an exclamatory particle.

**Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**
Only because it is great does it seem unremarkable. Only those whose virtue is truly great harm themselves by claiming distinction, so they feign folly, appearing unremarkable, making no distinctions, and not elevating themselves above others. If it had long resembled something—*xiào* (善), meaning "excellence"—if great scholars and wise ones, tall and self-exalted, practiced meticulous governance, such ways have long existed.

「Its subtlety, *ah!* (夫), is that those who speak of *xiào* (善, excellence) are but like petty men, not the noble. Only the wise uphold it.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Only because the Sage’s virtue is lofty and great does he not boast before things. If he boasted, he would be like the multitude of small-minded ones.

Master He Shang’s original text used the character *xiào* (肖), "not resembling" being akin to "not excellent" (不善). It means that all beings, unable to follow the excellent Dao/Way, are thus deemed unworthy by my greatness. Only through arrogance and haughtiness does my greatness fail to be excellent. If one can practice the excellent Dao/Way, they should instead be humbled and modest.

**The Third Section: Emphasizing the Three Treasures, urging all to take refuge therein.**
I possess the Three Treasures, safeguarding and upholding them.

○ **Master Yu’s Annotation:**
Though my Dao is great, it resembles nothing and lacks form, yet it holds these Three Practices, which are most precious. If one can steadfastly preserve, rely upon, and uphold them, they may govern themselves and the realm.

○ **Master Yu’s Commentary:**
This clarifies why it appears unremarkable: precisely because it possesses these Three Practices, differing from the common ways. Thus, Master Laozi says my Dao, though great, resembles nothing, yet these Three Treasures are most precious.

To you, my successor, you must preserve and uphold them, safeguarding them to cultivate virtue and govern the realm.

○ **Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**
Master Laozi speaks of my Three Treasures—compassion, frugality, and not daring to lead the world first—embraced and upheld.

○ **Rong’s Explanation:**
I possess Three Treasures: first, compassion (慈); second, frugality (俭); third, not daring to lead the world first (不敢为天下先). The common world values profit, esteeming it with seven rarities. The Dao lies in truth, weighing it with the Three Treasures. The meaning of the Three Treasures is not something sought externally; if one can be benevolent and wise toward all things, cherishing life and abhorring slaughter, this is the meaning of compassion.

To reduce taxes and lighten burdens, to be cautious in self-conduct and moderate in expenditure, neither extravagant nor ostentatious—this is the meaning of frugality.

To forget oneself for the sake of others, to retreat and guide them, not daring to lead the world first—this is the meaning of humility. To uphold these practices and cultivate virtue, applying these three principles, brings peace to the realm and tranquility to the family. Such is the greatness of this treasure.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
Thus, the Sage’s virtue is lofty and great, yet he does not boast before things, for it is by taking refuge in the Three Treasures—preserving and upholding them—that he attains this state. The Three Treasures are: first, compassion; second, frugality; third, not daring to lead the world first.

○ **Master Yu’s Annotation:**
Compassion leads to broad salvation; frugality ensures sufficiency. Not daring to lead the world first means he delights in advancing others without weariness.

○ **Master Yu’s Commentary:**
This enumerates the Three Treasures. To embody benevolence and extend generosity, to love and nurture all beings—this is compassion. To moderate use and enrich others, not to deplete things—this is frugality. Not to initiate actions, but to harmonize without leading—this is not daring to lead the world first. The meaning of expansion and benefit is as follows in the text below.

○ **Master He Shang’s Interpretation:**
First, compassion—loving the people as if they were his own children. Second, frugality—levying taxes and burdens as though taking from himself. Third, not daring to lead the world first—practicing humility and retreat, not initiating discord.

○ **Master Cheng’s Commentary:**
First, compassion—pitying and caring for the common folk, sharing their sorrows and joys. This is the Dao’s treasure. Second, frugality—desiring little and knowing contentment, guarding one’s portion without pride. This is the scripture’s treasure. Third, not daring to lead the world first—humble, yielding, and gentle, placing others before oneself, retreating to guide others. This is the Teacher’s treasure.

**The Third Section: Repeating the Three Treasures, praising their efficacy.**
Compassion thus fosters courage,

○ **Master Yu’s Annotation:**
Compassion and benevolence, pity and wisdom, mean virtue abounds, hence courage in salvation and aid.

○ **Master Yu’s Commentary:**
This reveals the Three Treasures’ power to dispel confusion. Ordinary men, when not compassionate, are courageous. In decisiveness, they reach exhaustion and constraint.

**Translation of overlapping terms for consistency:**
- *xiào* (善) = **excellence** (as in *xiào*道, the excellent Dao/Way)
- *xiào* (肖) = **resembling** (as in *xiào*似, resembling)
- *不肖* = **not resembling** (as in *不肖*, not resembling)
- *三宝* = **Three Treasures** (as in Daoist practice, not Buddhist *triple gems*)
- *保而持之* = **safeguarding and upholding them**
- *修身理国* = **cultivate virtue and govern the realm** (consistent with previous translations)

The Sage now practices compassion as conduct, hence his courage in salvation and deliverance.
*The Analects* states: "The virtuous must have courage."

○ Master He Shang says: Through compassion and benevolence, one attains courage in loyalty and filial piety.

○ Master Rong says:
Compassion thus yields courage,
Frugality thus yields breadth,
Not daring to lead the world first thus yields completion as a vessel and longevity,
For compassion toward all things, none shall harm them.
When none harm them, there is no enemy before.
By having no enemy, thus one speaks of courage.

In application, extravagance is insufficient for affairs,
In practice, frugality leaves abundance for governance.
Reaching the distant and vast, hence one speaks of breadth.

Elevating oneself in humility and retreat,
Guarding with yielding and softness,
Its virtue is universal,
Its conduct has completion,
Honored by all things, thus one attains completion as a vessel and longevity.

○ Master Cheng’s Annotation:
Internally repaying great compassion,
Externally expanding to embrace all,
Thus courage enters the Three Realms,
Descending to rescue the common folk.

Frugality thus yields breadth.
*御注*: By moderating expenses and cherishing resources, wealth abounds,
Hence one’s deeds extend broadly.

○ *御疏*: Through moderation and frugality, not harming resources or people,
Thus one’s deeds extend broadly.

○ Master He Shang says: When the sovereign practices frugality,
The people’s daily lives grow broad and ample.

○ Master Cheng’s Annotation: All dharmas are empty and illusory,
Abandoning them without greed,
Frugal, pure, and lofty—
Its virtue is vast and profound.

Not daring to lead the world first, thus one attains completion as a vessel and longevity.
*御注*: The virtues of compassion and frugality,
Through humility and self-effacement, grow ever brighter.
To place others before oneself—
People will never tire of it,
Thus one becomes the supreme vessel of the Dao.

○ *御疏*: Diminishing oneself to benefit others,
Retreating to advance all things—
This is not daring to lead the world first.
Thus all things rejoice in being pushed forward,
And one becomes the supreme vessel of the Dao.

○ Master He Shang says: Not daring to lead the world first,
Not daring to be first among the world’s first.
Thus one attains completion as a vessel and longevity—
Completion as a vessel refers to the Dao-perfected,
I am able to be the leader among those who embody the Dao.

○ Master Cheng’s Annotation: Only for the sake of courageously rescuing the common folk,
Retreating to guide all things,
Thus in the secular world, one dwells alone in the Celestial Capital,
As the leader of all the Saints,
Descending to the mortal realm, one occupies the august Nine-Ranked position,
As the honored vessel of the Dao.

**Fourth Section: Illustrious Conduct Contrary to the Three Treasures Leads to Ruin and Death in Life and Beyond.**

Abandoning compassion and courage,
Abandoning frugality and breadth,
Abandoning humility for precedence—
Death.

*御注*: Now abandoning compassion and courage,
Courage harms all things.
Abandoning frugality and breadth,
Breadth depletes resources.
Abandoning humility for precedence,
Precedence invites resentment.
Depleting resources and harming all things,
Accumulating resentment among people—
This is the path that leads to death.

○ *御疏*: *且* means "temporarily."
Following base desires and excessive cravings,
Every action defies the Dao.
Combining the compassion that benefits all with reckless harm,
Abandoning moderation in use for extravagant excess,
Abandoning humility for arrogant precedence—
Such conduct violates compassion and frugality.
Applied to governance, the realm perishes;
Applied to self-cultivation, the body is lost—
Hence it is said: Death.

○ Master He Shang says: Now abandoning compassion and courage,
Commanding the world to abandon benevolence,
Only to pursue martial valor.
Abandoning frugality and breadth,
Abandoning restraint,
Only to indulge in extravagance.
Abandoning humility for precedence,
Abandoning self-effacement,
Only to strive to be first among all.
Death—such actions inevitably lead to the path of death.

○ Master Rong says: Earlier, it was shown that those who possess the Three Treasures
Practice compassion and attain courage,
Uphold frugality and achieve breadth,
Reside in humility yet reach precedence.
Now, those who lose the Three Treasures
Cannot truly be compassionate,
Temporarily knowing only reckless courage,
Their conduct cannot uphold frugality,
Their expenditures are boundless,
They do not comprehend humility or retreat,
Eagerly seeking to surpass all others.
To love courage without benevolence is futile,
To seek breadth without restraint brings ruin,
To reside first without virtue invites peril—
Hence it is said: Death.

○ Master Yan says: Rejecting harmony and defying the divine,
Every action defies nature,
Distancing oneself from blessings,
Drawing near to calamity,
The Great Fate is severed,
Vital essence and spirit disperse—
Not because one’s fate is thin,
Nor because others are malevolent,
But because one abandons the Dao and extols force.

**Fifth Section: A Comprehensive Praise of Great Compassion, Whose Function is Supreme and Marvelous.**

Compassion—
When wielded in battle, it conquers;
When wielded in defense, it fortifies.

*御注*: Using compassion in battle,
Its advantage lies in preserving the multitude.
Using compassion in defense,
Its advantage lies in securing the people.
Each safeguarding their own security,
Thus victory and fortification are attained.

○ *御疏*: Compassion is the foremost of the Three Treasures,
Hence it is singled out for special praise.
Using compassion to repel war,
One can preserve the multitude.
Using compassion to defend,
One can secure the people—
All without losing compassion,
Thus victory and fortification are attained.

○ Master He Shang says: Those who embody compassion and benevolence,
The people naturally turn to them with loyalty,
Their hearts and intentions united,
Thus in battle they conquer the enemy,
In defense they stand firm and unyielding.

○ Master Rong says: Compassion in battle yields victory,
In defense yields fortification.
Heaven aids those who are saved,
With compassion as their shield,
Using compassion as their means,
They do not stray from the Dao.
In battle, they inevitably overcome their foes,
Hence it is said: victory.
In defense, they face no collapse or peril,
Hence it is said: fortification.
With compassion as their heart,
The Mysterious Heaven thus protects them,
Hence it is said: *saved*.
The Supreme Dao thus preserves and guards them,
Hence it is said: *shielded*.
Internally discerning right and wrong,
In conflict, they form the array,
Dispelling delusion is victory,
The body not losing the Dao is defense.
Aligning with the Dao, enduring through time, they are unharmed,
Heaven aids them—
Externally, no harm comes from things,
The Dao shields them.

○ Master Cheng’s Annotation: Compassion in battle yields victory,
With great compassion in the battlefield,
Soldiers are moved by gratitude,
Thus swift and decisive triumph is achieved.
Internally resolving [delusion] is like the Six Roots as soldiers,
Confronting the Six Dusts without being obscured,
Thus victory is attained.

With compassion as their defense, they are steadfast,
Using compassion to guard and shield,
The people unite in harmony,
Thus they are firmly secure.

Internally resolving with a compassionate and tranquil heart,
Their Dao-heart is unshakable and impenetrable.
The Mysterious Heaven aids them in salvation,
The Dao shields them with compassion.

○ Master Yu’s Annotation:
Using compassion in both war and defense,
Not only does it bring human accord,
The Heavenly Dao is most clear—
It also aids and shields them.

Victory in battle is Heaven’s salvation,
Steadfastness in defense is Heaven’s protection.
All this stems from compassion,
Thus it is said: *Heaven’s salvation and protection through compassion*.

○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:
*Salvation* means *assistance*,
*Protection* means *safeguarding*.
The Heavenly Dao blesses the virtuous—
The virtuous thrive, encountering no adversity.
Thus those who wage war with compassion,
Heaven will assist them.
Those who defend with compassion,
Heaven will safeguard them.
Victory and steadfastness begin with the practice of compassion,
And end in receiving the Heavenly Dao’s clear aid.

○ Master He Shang Gong said:
The Heavenly Dao saves the virtuous,
Naturally granting them compassion and benevolence,
So they may cultivate and assist themselves.

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:
The Heavenly Sage reveres the Dao,
Saving and guiding those who practice compassion,
And in return, they share compassion and benevolence,
Thus Heaven descends to aid and protect them.

Hence, within the Three Treasures, compassion is paramount,
And among the Four Virtues, compassion is foremost—
Thus it is known that compassion’s meaning is vast indeed!

○ **The Sixty-Eighth Chapter on the Virtuous Warrior of Antiquity**
The reason this chapter follows the previous:
The prior chapter fully expounds the Three Treasures,
Praising the great compassion,
Thus this chapter follows to show
Those who uphold the Three Treasures
Attuned to the ancient Dao’s ultimate perfection.

This single chapter unfolds three themes:
First, it draws upon ancient truths to exhort practitioners,
Second, it briefly enumerates the Three Virtues, revealing their superior practice,
Third, it concludes with the Dao’s ultimate perfection, extolling their efficacy and power.

**First: Drawing upon ancient truths to exhort practitioners.**
In the age when the Fire Officer regulated time,
And the era of pure Dao was held in reverence,
Human hearts were simple and unadorned,
Unconcerned with ostentation.
Warriors who cultivated the Dao defended themselves with tranquil ease,
Those skilled in battle halted their weapons to achieve victory,
Their thoughts were like smoldering embers,
Their forms like withered wood.
Among beasts, they dwelled without alarm,
Within flocks of tame birds, they moved without disorder.
Thus, the Duke of Zou tended his calves,
Ignoring the filial submission of Yao’s heir,
And the Marquis of Cheng plowed his fields,
Rejecting the words of Yu’s challenge,
Their conduct stood tall as Mount Hua’s peaks,
Their demeanor humble as Mount Ni’s summit.
The Son of Heaven could not claim them as subjects,
The feudal lords could not count them as allies.
Confronting the business of the Dragon,
They feared not,
Dwelling among wooden geese,
They had nothing to dread—
Thus the virtuous warriors of antiquity
Were worthy to be paired with Heaven itself!

The virtuous warrior does not rely on force,
○ Master Yu’s Annotation:
*Warrior* means *one who serves*.
*Force* means *threatening might*.
The enlightened ruler governs with virtue,
Practices compassion and frugality to subdue all things,
Does not employ force to dominate people,
Holding compassion as their highest virtue—
Thus it is said: *they do not rely on force*.

○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:
*Warrior* means *one who serves*.
Those who govern the state with virtue
Hold virtue as their highest value—
Thus it is said: *they do not rely on force*.

○ Master He Shang Gong said:
The noble is in virtue and Dao,
Not in martial prowess.

○ Master Rong said:
With compassion to approach all things,
With virtue to subdue people,
No state relies on brute strength,
No warrior values mere courage—
Without action yet transforming,
This is *not relying on force*.

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:
The virtuous warriors of antiquity
Cultivated the Dao in quietude and withdrawal,
Never abandoning compassion for force and courage.

**Second: Briefly enumerating the Three Virtues to reveal their superior practice.**
The skilled warrior does not rage,
○ Master Yu’s Annotation:
If war is unavoidable, one must confront the enemy,
With compassion, it is virtuous—
Not relying on fury.
If one uses force to contend,
It is not virtuous victory,
For the soft can overcome the distant,
The near can overcome the strong.

○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:
When the army marches to confront the enemy,
Their purpose is rooted in compassion and pity.
They drive away the stinging insects,
Expel the pests—
That is all.
Thus it is known that virtuous warfare lies in halting the enemy,
Not in relying on fury—
Hence it is said: *the skilled warrior does not rage*.

○ Master He Shang Gong said:
Those who wage war with the Dao
Restrain evil in their hearts,
Cutting off calamity before it sprouts,
Never harboring resentment or anger.

○ Master Rong said:
To still the bandits and quell chaos is virtuous warfare.
Compassion saves all things—
No need for rage.

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:
Skilled in penetrating the illusory nature of the world,
They can subdue the enemy before its rise,
Masterfully embodying the emptiness of both opposition and compliance,
Thus their hearts hold neither joy nor anger.

The one who truly triumphs over the enemy does not contend,
○ Master Yu’s Annotation:
Victory lies in harmony,
Harmony brings virtuous triumph—
The ultimate virtue of complete victory,
Thus they do not engage in contention.

○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:
Virtuous victory lies in compassion,
Not contending stems from upholding virtue.
If one uses force to seek victory,
It is not virtuous triumph.
Now, the soft overcomes the distant,
The near overcomes the strong,
Compassion and harmony are fully expressed,
They do not contend with the enemy—
The enemy surrenders on its own,
Thus it is said: *the one who truly triumphs does not contend*.

○ Master He Shang Gong said:
Those who wage war with the Dao to triumph over the enemy
Draw the near with benevolence,
Attract the distant with virtue,
Do not engage the enemy in battle—
Yet the enemy submits itself.

○ Master Rong said:
The Dao brings aid to all under Heaven,
The Four Seas come to acknowledge their rule,
Virtue soothes the inner realm,
The Five Weapons are not raised—
Things are subdued without blades,
Thus it is said: *triumph over the enemy*.
Without intent yet naturally revered,
Thus it is said: *no contention*.

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:
Unsoiled by the dusts,
This is called *triumph over the enemy*—
Since they hold neither joy nor anger,
What need is there for contention?

The virtuous leader uses others by placing themselves below,
○ Master Yu’s Annotation:
To employ others, they set themselves beneath,
All people exert their utmost strength—
This is the virtue of the bell and the clapper,
Thus it is said: *the virtuous leader uses others by placing themselves below*.

○ Master Yu’s Exegesis:
The virtuous leader employs others through humility,
Thus people will exert their utmost strength,
And success can be achieved.
Hence the *Book of Changes* says:
*To place the noble below the humble,
The great gain the people’s trust*.

○ Master He Shang Gong said:
The virtuous leader employs others through humble assistance,
Always acting as the helper of others’ humility.

○ Master Rong said:
To use others without losing their natural talents,
To assign tasks according to their strengths in both culture and martial skill—
This is virtuous leadership.
The broad can encompass all,
The humble can avoid blame,
Thus it is said: *placing themselves below*.

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:
Those who practice humility and self-effacement
Will naturally be revered by all things,
Thus they can employ others effectively.

The third *gōng* (structure) reaches the ultimate Dao/Way, praising virtuous power and capability.
This is called the virtue/power of non-contentiousness.

○ Imperial Commentary (Tang Xuanzong):
This is called the virtue/power of non-contentiousness,
This is called employing others’ strength,
This is called aligning with the ancient Heavenly Dao/Way.
The virtuous leader prevails without contention,
The humble employs others’ strength.
Those who can do so may align with Heaven and be called emperors,
For this is the most ancient and essential Dao/Way.

○ Imperial Exegesis (Tang Xuanzong):
In the preceding *gōng*, the virtuous warrior is always gentle yet never weak,
The virtuous fighter is always compassionate yet never wrathful,
The virtuous victor is always yielding yet never contentious,
The virtuous leader is always humble and places themselves below others.
When one acts thus,
All things exhaust their abilities,
People give their utmost effort—
All resulting from humility and self-effacement.
Is this not the virtue/power of non-contentiousness?

○ Master He Shang Gong said:
It means the noble places themselves below the humble.
This is the Dao/Way of not contending with others for moral virtue and power.

○ Master Rong said:
This *gōng* describes how one prevails over enemies without martial strength or anger.

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:
By not contending with all things,
One perfects their own virtue/power.
This *gōng* praises the virtuous leader who prevails over enemies without contention.
This is called employing others’ strength.

○ Imperial Exegesis (Tang Xuanzong):
When one remains silent, reverent, and humble,
When one is modest and places themselves below others,
People are naturally pleased,
And willingly exert their utmost strength.
Thus the *Book of Odes* says:
*Delight them to employ,
And people forget their labor.*
This is employing others’ strength.

○ Master He Shang Gong said:
When one’s body can place itself below others,
This is called employing others’ strength.

○ Master Rong said:
This *gōng* praises the humble leader who employs others,
And thus people give their utmost effort.

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:
Humble and yielding like the female,
Not contending with all things,
Others will naturally submit and serve as their own tools.
This *gōng* praises the humble leader who employs others.

This is called aligning with the ancient Heavenly Dao/Way.

○ Imperial Exegesis (Tang Xuanzong):
This summarizes the four preceding *gōng* on virtuous conduct,
The virtue/power of non-contentiousness.
Those who can practice it may align with Heaven and be called emperors,
For this is the most ancient and essential Dao/Way.

○ Master He Shang Gong said:
This is called aligning with Heaven.
Those who can practice this have virtue/power aligning with Heaven.
This is the most ancient Dao/Way,
The most essential and concise Dao/Way of antiquity.

○ Master Rong said:
To embrace all things with the Dao/Way,
To attract the distant through culture,
To prevail over enemies without battle,
To stand alone in eminence without contention—
Their virtue/power is vast and exalted,
Comparable to Heaven above.
Their transformation is pure and harmonious,
Comparable to the ancient past.
They clarify the empty heart and full belly,
They sit in forgetfulness and merge with the Dao/Way,
They do not rely on coercive authority,
They do not exert themselves in martial prowess,
Thus it is said: *the virtuous warrior is never weak*.
They extinguish the emotions of right and wrong,
They remove the perceptions of love and hate,
Thus the virtuous fighter is never wrathful.
All things do not harm the martial,
They comply without resistance,
Thus the virtuous leader prevails over enemies without contention.
When the heart-king (mind) is tranquil,
And their aspiration lies in the *chōngxū* (void),
Their ears and eyes are undisturbed,
Their hands and feet are unlabored,
This is the humble leader who employs others.
In accordance with natural principles,
Hence it is said: *aligning with Heaven*.
Harmonizing with ancient truth,
Reaching the Dao/Way’s ultimate fruit—
This is the ancient Dao/Way.

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis:
*Config* means *to align*.
*Heaven* means *natural*.
*Extreme* means *the fruit of the Dao/Way*.
It speaks of the virtuous practitioner who subtly embodies emptiness,
Who penetrates the principles of inverse and compliance,
Who does not contend with all things,
And thus aligns with the utmost natural principles,
Harmonizing with the ancient Dao/Way’s extreme fruit.
This concludes the *gōng*.

*On the Practice of Warfare (Yongbing) #69*

This chapter follows the previous one, for the prior chapter expounded upon those who guard and uphold the Three Treasures, who can attain the Dao/Way’s ultimate fruit of antiquity. Thus, this chapter elucidates how such practitioners embody the dual transcendence of emptiness and existence, never abandoning great compassion.

Within this single chapter, four distinct teachings unfold:
1. **The application of martial power in dealing with all things**, demonstrating that all phenomena are illusory;
2. **A reiteration of prior teachings**, to reveal true emptiness;
3. **The practitioner who forsakes compassion**, who grows reckless and loses the Dao/Way;
4. **The exercise of wisdom in traversing the world**, which never strays from great compassion.

### **1. The application of martial power in dealing with all things, demonstrating that all phenomena are illusory.**
When the sage-king **Emperor Yao** ruled, he slew **Gonggong** yet lamented his wickedness; when **Great Yu** acted, he struck down **Fangfeng** yet displayed righteous resolve. **Tang** exiled **Jie** to **Wutiao**, and **Wu** slaughtered **Zhou** at **Muye**. The **Divine Lady** (Xuannü) blazed forth, and the **White Deceiver** (Bai Jian) stood tall—though they waged external war against evil men, they were ultimately inwardly shamed by the triumph of virtue.

The **Old Master** (Laojun) teaches caution: *"Retreat one foot, and my advance will be halted; press forward one inch, and I will not dare."* He feared losing his treasured virtue, lamenting the fleeting, deluded life of mortals. How could they know that when the **high black crow** (gao wu) is exhausted, the **fine bow** (liang gong) is concealed; when enemy states are diminished, the **strategists** (mou chen) perish?

Before the **military wells** (junjing) were dug, the soldiers would not thirst; before the **camp rations** (junfan) were cooked, the generals would not speak of hunger. Though **Bai Qi** was put to death in the **Qin court** and **Han Xin** was executed in the **Han prison**, why not follow the **two sages’** (Er Hao) example—hanging up one’s official hat at the **eastern gate**, emulating the **Four Worthies’** (Sihao) virtues, and letting thirst be nourished in the **Southern Hills**?

Honor the **Great Sage’s** (Dasheng) clear instruction on self-restraint: *"As long as my body remains, what need have I for further gain?"*

### **On the Practice of Warfare:**
**Imperial Commentary:** The Old Master deplored the age’s reckless slaughter in war, thus assuming antiquity to admonish it.

*"On the Practice of Warfare"* refers to the following text.

**Imperial Exegesis:** The Old Master lamented the times, where lightheartedness toward enemies brings calamity and delight in killing leads to ruin. Thus, he invoked ancient teachings to warn against such folly, and *"On the Practice of Warfare"* refers to the next sentence.

**Master He** (Heshang Gong) says: *"He expounds the Dao/Way of warfare. The Old Master deplored the age’s warfare, thus assuming his own words to set forth their meaning."*

**Master Rong** (Master Rong) says: *"He cites ancient military strategies."*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *"On the Practice of Warfare"* means **martial power and wisdom** (quan zhi), the means by which one transforms and governs all beings—it is also how cultivators apply the **Six Senses** (liujing) in navigating the **phenomenal world** (chenjing). *"On the Practice of Warfare"* refers to the following text.

*"I do not dare to act as the aggressor but only as the defender,"*
**Imperial Commentary:** *"I do not dare to act as the aggressor but only as the defender"* means not daring to press forward one inch while retreating one foot. When the aggressor moves, he creates conflict and covetousness; when the defender remains passive, he relies on compassion to protect himself. To guard well is to achieve total victory; to create conflict is to court defeat. Though advancing even slightly risks stirring trouble, retreating even greatly does not lose humility. Thus, one must not dare to press forward one inch while retreating one foot.*

**Imperial Exegesis:** *"I"* refers to the practitioner of warfare. The aggressor is the first to act, the defender responds afterward. The aggressor’s advance stirs conflict and covetousness; the defender’s retreat relies on compassion to guard himself. This teaches that ancient warriors, when wielding martial power, must always restrain themselves with compassion and never act impulsively.

Thus it is said: *"I do not dare to act as the aggressor but only as the defender."*

**Master He** says: *"I do not dare to act as the aggressor"*—the aggressor is the first to raise arms. *"But only as the defender"*—the defender is one who yields without provocation, always following the **Heavenly Mandate** (tian) before acting.*

**Master Rong** says: *"To raise arms first within one’s own state is to act as the aggressor; to move first in battle is to act as the aggressor. First to raise arms or first to move invites arrogance and peril. Now, if I wish to preserve myself, I must not dare to act as the aggressor. To yield without provocation, to follow without leading, is to act as the defender."*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *"Aggressor"* refers to **myself** (my body); *"defender"* refers to **the enemy** (the opposing forces). Since both **essence and matter** (genchen) are emptied and all phenomena are illusory, there is neither a self to be preserved nor an enemy to be assailed. Thus, there is no need to advance or retreat.

*"I do not dare to press forward one inch while retreating one foot."*
**Imperial Exegesis:** To retreat and defend in accordance with the Dao/Way is to achieve victory; to advance and seize by force leads to ruin. Though advancing even slightly risks the sin of greed, retreating even greatly gains the virtue of humility. Now, since I despise their strife, I say *"I do not dare to press forward one inch,"* and since I uphold compassion, I say *"I retreat one foot."*

**Master He** says: *"To invade another’s territory, to plunder their wealth and treasures, is to advance. To close the gates and defend the city is to retreat."*

**Master Rong** says: *"Not to use force to invade others, hence *"I do not dare to press forward one inch."* To rely on accumulated virtue to defend internally, hence *"I retreat one foot."*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** *"Advance"* means **to take**; *"retreat"* means **to release**. One inch signifies **nothingness**; one foot signifies **existence**. Since both **wisdom and the world** (jingjing) are transcended and all phenomena are illusory, one abides in the **middle** (zhongyi), detached from both **action and non-action** (liangpian). Thus, there is nothing to take, nor anything to release.

### **2. Reiterating prior teachings to reveal true emptiness.**
This is called **"action without action"** (xing wu xing),

**Imperial Commentary:** When one retreats as the defender and does not contend, though one may move to meet the enemy, it is the same as **"action without action."**

**Imperial Exegesis:** To march an army relies on halting the enemy; the key is not to contend. Now, as the defender retreating one foot, one achieves victory without contention. Though one moves to meet the enemy, it aligns with **"action without action."**

**Master He** says: *"If the enemy does not cease, he becomes a robber of the world. Though one moves to punish him, one does not act with malice."*

**Master Rong** says: *"Warfare originates from the enemy; I truly do not act first. I respond to things but do not initiate action—this is **"action without action."***

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:** Having transcended the duality of existence and non-existence, and penetrating the **forgetfulness of all perceptions** (jingguan), one thus moves in **"action without action."**

*"Though I have no arms to wield,"*
**Imperial Exegesis:** *"To wield arms"* signifies **anger**. Now, since one wages war without anger, it is as if there are no arms to wield. Hence it is said: *"Though I have no arms to wield."*

「○ Master He says: *"Not to be angry is as though there were no arms to wield."*

○ Master Yan says: *"This demonstrates not harming others."*

First to issue commands and rewards—those who submit early are rewarded, those who submit late are spared, those who surrender slightly are benefited, those who surrender greatly are prosperous, the guilty are pardoned, the capable are appointed—yet it is as though there were no arms to wield in anger.

○ Master Rong says: *"To wage war in anger is to use arms to wield them. Now, when the enemy retreats a step, no arms are needed to repel them, hence it is said: 'as though there were no arms to wield.'"*

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *"Having abandoned limbs and senses, there are no arms to wield."*

**Still, there is no enemy,**
○ Imperial Exegesis: *"Still"* means "to draw in." To draw in the enemy is to desire contention while not contending, hence it is as though there were no enemy to draw in.

○ Imperial Exegesis: *"Still"* means "to draw in." The one who draws in the enemy desires contention, but now non-contention is held as virtue—thus, there is no enemy to draw in, hence it is said: *"Still, there is no enemy."*

○ Master He says: *"Even if there is a desire to draw in the enemy, it is as though there were no enemy to draw in."*

○ Master Rong says: *"To draw in that enemy is to make them return to having no enemy."*

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *"All phenomena are empty illusions; there is no enemy to rely upon."*

**To grasp without weapons.**
○ Imperial Exegesis: *"To grasp weapons"* signifies killing. Now, since compassion is the principle, even if one grasps them, it is as though there were no weapons.

○ Imperial Exegesis: *"To grasp"* means "to hold." Weapons are the five weapons—spears, halberds, and the like. He who holds weapons intends to kill the enemy, but since compassion is the principle, he restrains his weapons—thus, though weapons exist, there is no intent to kill, making it as though there were no weapons.

○ Master He says: *"Even if one desires to grasp and wield them, it is as though there were no weapons to hold or use."*

Why? Because harming their people invites retribution from Heaven, encountering an unrighteous ruler brings pity and sorrow.

○ Master Rong says: *"To harm the unrighteous is to wield weapons to cease warfare. Punishments without cruelty do not lose compassion; those who yearn for the Dao return of their own accord—there are no weapons to wield."*

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *"Having abandoned form and wisdom, there are no weapons to use."*

**Thirdly, it clarifies that those who abandon compassion are lighthearted, lose the Dao, and invite disaster.**
Disaster is none greater than being lighthearted toward the enemy—being lighthearted toward the enemy nearly causes the loss of my treasure.

○ Imperial Exegesis: *"The greatest disaster is being lighthearted toward the enemy. Being lighthearted toward the enemy leads to peril, and one loses the treasure of compassion."*

○ Imperial Exegesis: *"Nearly"* means "close to." *"Loss"* means "to lose." *"Treasure"* refers to compassion. The greatest disaster is being lighthearted and contemptuous toward the enemy, indulging in conflict—thus, one is close to losing the treasure of compassion.

Moreover, losing compassion means defeat and ruin in war, and dispersion in defense. Though the paths of disaster may vary, dispersion and ruin are the greatest calamities.

○ Master He says: *"Disaster is none greater than being lighthearted toward the enemy. The harm of chaos is none greater than deceiving and plundering a lighthearted enemy without cease—lighthearted warfare leads to defeat and ruin. Being lighthearted toward the enemy nearly causes the loss of my treasure—'nearly' means 'close to,' and 'treasure' means 'life.' Deceiving a lighthearted enemy nearly causes the loss of life."*

○ Master Yan says: *"Being lighthearted toward the enemy is self-indulgence. Though warfare may seem flawless, one must not lightly treat the enemy. Lightheartedness breeds deceit; when disaster strikes, one loses advantage. Fortune departs, calamity arrives—this is the loss of the natural treasure."*

○ Master Rong says: *"Warfare is rooted in killing and should not be perpetually waged in times of conflict. The Dao values stillness and quietude; thus, one governs things through non-action. The priority is to settle the people without harm. If one abandons the Way of non-action and advances with restless warfare, being lighthearted toward the enemy, the state will collapse and the people perish—this is the greatest disaster. A prosperous state with abundant people, a sage ruler and virtuous ministers—this is called possessing treasure. When the people perish and grain is exhausted, ministers are humiliated and the ruler is in peril—this is the loss of treasure."*

○ Master Cheng’s Exegesis: *"Disaster is none greater than contempt for the enemy. 'Contempt' means to lightly trample; 'enemy' refers to the frontier realm. Lightly staining oneself with dust invites the retribution of the Three Realms, thus bringing great disaster. Contempt for the enemy nearly causes the loss of my treasure—'nearly' means 'completely,' and 'treasure' refers to the Three Treasures from the previous chapter. To contain compassion while being bold is to contempt the enemy, inviting great calamity, thus completely losing the Three Treasures."*

**Fourthly, it clarifies that when engaging with circumstances and applying wisdom, nothing surpasses great compassion.**
Thus, when armies clash, the one who exhibits compassion first shall prevail.

○ Imperial Exegesis: *"Antagonize"* means "to raise." When two states raise their armies against each other, the one who is compassionate and pitiful toward others wins.

○ Imperial Exegesis: *"Antagonize"* means "to raise." When two states raise their armies against each other, it is because their rulers practice the Dao, their generals act with compassion, and they are merciful toward others—not seeking excessive slaughter—that they achieve victory.

○ Master He says: *"Thus, when armies clash—the two enemies engage in battle—compassion prevails. Compassion is mercy and benevolence; soldiers do not approach death."*

○ Master Yan says: *"The ruler is the heart and core of the state; the army is its formidable spirit. Concealed in the mysterious realm, it is only used when unavoidable. Thus, I instruct my generals to delight the soldiers, be compassionate toward people, and move with Heaven’s assistance."*

○ Master Rong says: *"When both sides raise their forces, it is called 'antagonizing armies.' Whether many or few, they are evenly matched. Being lighthearted toward the enemy, greedy for killing—this is inferior. Stillness must rely on the Dao; action must follow its laws. Never losing compassion, compassion can govern all—thus, the compassionate prevail. Internally, it clarifies that afflictions are manifold; without wisdom, they cannot be broken. To expound its method, it is said: 'Warfare has its principles.'*

*The ruler must be strong and resolute; as a guest, one must be yielding and flexible. The traveler desires to cease movement and return to stillness, knowing to be strong as a ruler and yielding as a guest—hence it is said: 'I dare not be the ruler but must be the guest.'*

*The Dao, though seemingly obscured, advances like retreat. Learning has nothing to learn; cultivation has nothing to cultivate—advancing not an inch yet retreating a foot. Recognizing that all conditions are contingent and teachings are all empty, one moves in 'action without action.'"*

The myriad realms are void and tranquil, yet one’s own body is also empty and pure—*repelling without arms*. Internally, wisdom is lost; *holding without weapons*. Externally, emotions and desires are severed, yet still there is no enemy.

If one abandons emotions and indulges in extreme desires, straying from the Dao and forfeiting one’s life, they lose their precious treasure.

Wisdom and afflictions—these two kinds always follow one in turn. *Resisting is like yielding*; if skillful means are applied to wisdom, subtle compassion is never lost. When defilements are exhausted, even the mind relaxes; solemn and unburdened, the compassionate prevail.

○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: If, then. Compassion, mercy. Resisting, lifting. The roots of sense and dust press upon one; lifting the eyes, the forms and colors correspond.

If one still employs the great mercy of the heart to survey the coming realm, then subject and object are both emptied, and self and other are pure. Hence, all dharmas become realms of supreme victory.

The Way of my words is most easy to know—*Chapter Seventy*.

The Way of my words follows the previous chapter, for the previous chapter expounds the proper method of dealing with people and wielding power, demonstrating the true emptiness of the Dao. Thus, this chapter follows, clarifying the teachings of the spoken word and lamenting that people cannot know them.

In this chapter, the text opens with two distinctions: first, lamenting that the profound teaching is easy to know yet common folk cannot grasp it; second, illustrating the sage’s subtle understanding, hence *outerly veiled, inwardly revealed*.

First, lamenting that the profound teaching is easy to know yet common folk cannot grasp it.

*The Book of Yu* says: The heart of the Dao is subtle, subtle then easy to perceive; the heart of people is dark, dark then difficult to see. They follow the crowd and drift with conventions, chasing fame and gain. Blessings are light as feathers, yet they do not know to bear them upon themselves; calamities are heavy as mountains, yet they do not know to avoid them from themselves.

The common folk are indeed deluded in their measure; truly, this saying holds. The Way beneath heaven is easy to practice, yet none surpass the upright. Uninvolved, unconcerned, with no attachments nor demands.

Where is the resting place of the mind? Roaming the wilds of Dongting, boundless in all directions—no hindrance. In the silent night or the celestial halls, all paths are the same, utterly pure. Shutting the eyes, one arrives at the *Pure Land of Jade*; forgetting the mind, one sits in the *Empty Palace of Jade*. Still and unobstructed by dust, what need is there for the wise to change? Yet they stubbornly persist, indulging in luxury at dawn’s table; staining themselves with sounds and colors in their attachments. Slothful and fixed in evil deeds, they sink into the *difficult-to-abandon* realm, unaware of the easy-to-practice teaching. The sage in rags is indeed worthy of pity.

My words are most easy to know, most easy to practice.

○ *Master Yu’s Annotation*: The Old Master says: My spoken words accord with principle, hence easy to know; they are simple in practice, hence easy to act.

○ *Master Yu’s Commentary*: The Old Master says: My words are such that they clarify principle. When principle is clarified, words are forgotten—hence easy to know. My affairs are such that they involve no affairs; simplicity in affairs means no action—hence easy to practice.

○ *Master He Shang Gong* says: The Old Master’s words are concise and easy to know, brief and easy to practice.

○ *Master Yan* says: The sage’s words are the unsaid words; their deeds are the *doing of the undone*. They sever the Way of words, abandon the mind and discard intentions. Their actions are the manifestation of naturalness. All beings fulfill their desires and attain eternal life. Words are easy to know; affairs are easy to practice.

○ *Master Rong* says: The sage’s teachings are concise in words yet rich in principle, clearly revealing their meaning—hence easy to know. Holding to the One, they sever the myriad delusions; embracing non-action, they cut free from burdens—hence easy to practice.

○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: My words are the same as the previous chapter. What is stained is not truly stained—this is easy to know. To practice without the form of practice is most easy to practice. None beneath heaven can know, none can practice.

○ *Master Yu’s Annotation*: The people of the world are entangled in words and do not awaken; they are burdened by affairs and do not simplify—hence none can know, none can practice.

○ *Master Yu’s Commentary*: This laments that the multitude cannot comprehend the *wordless word*, clinging to words and stagnating in teaching. They are bewildered by the words of instruction, hence none can know. Unable to perceive the *affairless affair*, burdened by affairs and lost in dusty matters—hence none can practice.

○ *Master He Shang Gong* says: They love the weak and soft, yet crave the strong and rigid.

○ *Master Rong* says: The common folk do not adhere to the mysterious teachings; they cling to ignorance and have not yet opened to wisdom. They do not recognize this Way—hence none can know. They are lost in desires and do not habituate in non-action; they abandon the true and follow the false—hence none can practice.

○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: None, that is, without. The Old Master’s words are easy to know and practice, yet the people of the world are dull and obtuse. None can know the profound and empty words; none can follow the teaching and practice.

Words have a *root*; affairs have a *master*.

○ *Master Yu’s Annotation*: Words reside in principle; when principle is attained, words are forgotten—hence the root of words is in the wordless. Affairs reside in accomplishment; when success is achieved, one does not cling to them—hence the master of affairs is in the affairless.

○ *Master Yu’s Commentary*: This reverses the explanation of easy-to-know and easy-to-practice. Root, origin. Master, lord. Words exist to clarify principle; when principle is attained, words are forgotten—hence the root of words is in the unsaid. Affairs exist to achieve success; when success is attained, one abandons affairs—hence the master of affairs is in the affairless. Is this not easy to know and practice?

○ *Master He Shang Gong* says: My words have a root and origin; affairs have lords and subjects. The world’s people, if they do not know them, are not without virtue—it is they who oppose me.

○ *Master Rong* says: Root, origin. Master, lord. Taking virtue and the Dao as the origin, this is truly easy to know. Taking non-action as the lord, this is truly easy to practice. Those who lose the origin and chase the end are many; those who do not embody the true root and abandon emotions to defy nature are numerous. How could they know that the lord and master are such that all follow and practice accordingly? Hence it is said: None beneath heaven can know or practice.

○ *Master Cheng’s Commentary*: Words, the scriptures and teachings. Master, the Son of Heaven.

The teachings, though broad, find their essence in the *Zhongyuan* (Recondite Mystery). Worldly affairs, though manifold, are governed by the Lord and Master. Seizing this essential meaning reveals what is easy to know.

It is only because of their ignorance that they fail to know me.
*御注*: It is only because the common people lack the awakened understanding that they do not know my teaching of non-speech and non-affairs.

*御疏*: "Do not know me" means they do not know my teachings. It is only because the common people are bewildered and lack awakened understanding, bound by names and forms, unable to grasp the principles. In affairs, they cling to affairs; in speech, they are entangled in words—thus they fail to grasp my teaching of non-speech and non-affairs.

Again, it is explained: The Old Master said, "Only what I know is what lies in non-knowing," yet the people of the world use knowing to seek knowing, hence they do not know me.

*Master He Shang Gong* says: It is only because the world’s people are ignorant that my Dao and virtue remain obscure, unseen externally, reaching the utmost subtlety—thus they are without knowing.

*Master Rong* says: All things are shrouded in delusion, lacking even a speck of discernment within, hence it is said they are without knowing. Lost in principle and straying from the Way, they lack the wisdom of ten thousand things externally, hence they do not know me.

*Master Cheng’s Commentary*: "Do not know me" is the same as "do not know my teachings." Only those beings who are ignorant and dull-witted cannot comprehend my profound words. Those who know me are few, hence those who follow me are noble.

*御注*: Those who truly understand my teaching of forgetting knowing are rare. The law of my speechless instruction is thus most noble.

*御疏*: "Few" means "rare." "Law" means "principle." The Old Master said that those who understand my teaching of knowing while forgetting knowing are indeed few. If one follows and practices my words as law, then they may be held in honor.

*Master He Shang Gong* says: "Few" means "rare." Only those who attain the Dao can know me, hence they are noble.

*Master Rong* says: The busy and petty value names, the petty-minded love profit. Few can embody the Dao, hence it is said those who know me are few. The weak and lost do not return; their return lies in the true path. Those who drift do not reflect; their reflection lies in the true source. The Dao is thus honored, and the law is thus noble.

*Master Cheng’s Commentary*: Those who know me are few, for the common mind is shallow and many are deluded, few truly comprehending the sacred teachings. Those who follow me are noble—"follow" means "law." Adhering to my scriptures and teachings, practicing them, and attaining the sacred fruit, this is why they are noble.

Next, it is shown that the Sage’s wisdom is profound yet externally veiled, internally illuminated. Hence the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.

*御注*: Wearing coarse cloth means concealing the external. Harboring jade means illuminating the internal. Thus, those who know me are few.

*御疏*: "Coarse cloth" refers to a rough garment, worn by the lowly. Wrapping oneself in coarse cloth conceals fine garments beneath. Jade is pure and lustrous, fitting to compare with the virtuous gentleman. This is said to reveal the Sage’s inner wisdom, outwardly appearing foolish, hence "wearing coarse cloth," and inwardly possessing wisdom, hence "harboring jade."

*Master He Shang Gong* says: Wearing coarse cloth means being thin externally; harboring jade means being rich internally. It is to hide treasure and conceal virtue, not revealing it to others.

*Master Yan* says: Wearing coarse cloth means being meager in body; harboring jade means being rich in spirit.

*Master Rong* says: Conforming to the world and blending with dust, outwardly showing coarse garments—this is wearing coarse cloth. The Recondite Virtue is unstained, pure and luminous—this is harboring jade.

*Master Cheng’s Commentary*: Knowing the Sage’s words and following the Sage’s teachings, with understanding and practice complete, one thus becomes a Sage. Coarse cloth is the garment of rustics; jade is a precious treasure. Externally blending with the world, wearing coarse cloth; internally serene and empty, harboring jade. Harboring jade means outwardly dwelling in the mundane while always true; wearing coarse cloth means inwardly empty and focused while interacting with others.

**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**
This chapter follows the previous one because the previous chapter illuminated the Sage’s knowing, hence externally veiled and internally illuminated. Thus, this chapter follows, showing that even though one may know, there are many who mistake knowing for non-knowing. This chapter’s meaning is divided into two parts: first, revealing the traces of the original traces, demonstrating responses adapting to circumstances; second, revealing the stillness within responses, manifesting the Sage’s heart unburdened.

**First: Revealing the traces of the original traces, demonstrating responses adapting to circumstances.**

To shut the door and block the senses is the grand rule of the great Sage. To curb desires and be cautious of subtleties is the exemplary standard of the ancient worthies. Hence, the Duke of Zhou’s temple was restored with threefold silence from the golden mouth, and the Master’s courtyard saw twice-repeated words from the white jade tablet. Ji Bu was esteemed for a single promise, yet He Chen’s extravagance led to ruin at ten thousand coins. Austerity brings clarity and tranquility; extravagance invites reproach and calamity. Liu Kun, embodying the Dao, answered the Han Emperor with evident clarity. Yan Zi nearly attained it, dwelling in Confucius’ gate as if in ignorance. How could he compare with the clamorous thief Zhi, who died for gain at Dong Ling? The meticulous Jiang Chong perished in the Northern Prison from slander. Geng Chun was mocked in the marketplace and met with great disaster. Kong Guang did not betray the secret at Wen Shu, thus preserving his life.

Doing leads to ruin. Recently, observing the drilling of Hun Dun, one fails to grasp its subtlety. Yet, if one heeds the admonition of the enemy’s mirror, a hundred hooks will lead to ruin, while nurturing a chicken fully ensures victory. The Sage’s illness—is it for the sake of common folk?

Knowing the unknown...

「若不知而强知，则为知之病矣。知而绝知，不困於知知，故不生祸乱，而知之病息矣。
　　**知不知，上**—圣人妙契重玄，迹不乖本，洞忘虚寂，知则无知，至本虚凝，故称为上。圣人不言知，以其病病众生之强知，故不自病，怀通达之智，托於不知者，欲使天下质朴忠正，各守纯性。小人不悟此意，妄行强知之事，以自显着，终伤身损命，灭寿消年矣。

　　**不知知，病**—常俗之人强谓有知，执取着之缚，故为行之病。所照之境触境皆空，能鉴之智无智不寂，能所俱泯，境智同忘，若照如无照，知如无知，则为上德；否则，多知多失，损命伤身，是知之病也。

　　**人不畏威**—上天有龙象雷霆之威，冥司有三途五苦之罚。人若不畏破裂之苦，须臾堕地狱，遭极辛苦：隐隐搏天之羽，飞劫石而难周；皎皎日月之晖，照幽涂而莫晓；岩岩铜柱左右伤身，凛凛刀山纵横碎骨。魂魄号叫，思脱而无闻；出气成姻，吞铁丸而喉烂。前生何罪，得至於斯？良由狭其所居，不修於命，岂知唐尧化美，广辟四门，殷帝含仁，大开三面？吉祥止止，道德淳淳，其度量若大鹏举赤霄，长鲲跃沧海：举逸翮而纵凌唳，直压云天；蓄巨鳞而鼓波涛，横击淇渤。不知上下，莫辨东西，岂厌其生，以成偏狭，去彼取此者？此乃圣人之图也。」

If the people do not fear the lesser threats, then the greatest calamities shall come.

**Commentary (御注):** That which is truly a threat and worthy of fear is called *威 (Wei)*.

It is said that when one does not fear small matters, being careless of the subtle and minute, then the greatest and most fearful consequences shall arise.

**Exegesis (御疏):** That which is truly a threat and worthy of fear is called *威 (Wei)*.

The onset of misfortune and harm begins with the trivial and insignificant. Accumulated, these become burdensome afflictions—great threats. If one does not heed the small and subtle, then the great and fearful consequences shall come to pass.

**Master He Shang’s Saying (河上公曰):** *Wei* is harm. If one does not fear small harms, then great harms shall come—meaning death itself.

Those who fear should cultivate *jing* (精) and nurture *shen* (神), aligning with Heaven and Earth.

**Master Yan’s Saying (严曰):** Prosperity and decline, fortune and misfortune, all arise from oneself. If one does not fear the subtle, then greater fears shall manifest.

**Master Rong’s Saying (荣曰):** *Wei* refers to laws and punishments. If one does not fear minor transgressions, accumulating evil without restraint, violating laws and taboos, then ruin and death shall follow—great threats shall come.

Within, one does not fear the defilements of dust, indulging desires without restraint. When desires run wild, *jing* scatters; when the form is defiled, *shen* departs. When *shen* departs, the form decays; when *jing* scatters, the body weakens. Thus, one who enters the True Dao without *lǜ* (绿, vitality) becomes prey to birth and death—great threats shall come.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis (成疏):** *Wei* refers to punishments and laws, as in the scriptures and precepts. Great threats are the three evil realms and the punishments of the Northern City (地狱). It is said that those who disregard scriptures and precepts, recklessly committing evils, shall face the winds of punishment and great retribution—it shall surely come to pass.

**Second Admonition: Cultivate an Open Heart to Attain the True Source**

Do not narrow your dwelling.

**Commentary (御注):** The dwelling of the spirit is the heart.

To not narrow is to eliminate emotions and desires.

**Exegesis (御疏):** The dwelling of the spirit is the heart. One must forget emotions and desires, softening and widening the mind, allowing the spirit chambers to rest, so that the spirit may reside in the heart, and life may be preserved.

**Master He Shang’s Saying (河上公曰):** The heart, as the dwelling of the spirit, must be open and yielding, not narrow and constricted.

**Master Yan’s Saying (严曰):** No greater calamity exists than losing one’s body; no greater blessing than preserving life. The way to preserve life lies in nurturing the spirit, and the key to nurturing the spirit is in stillness and openness.

**Master Rong’s Saying (荣曰):** Do not narrow your dwelling, do not grow weary of your life. People take life as joy, cherishing birth as noble. Yet they fail to rest quietly to nurture life, cultivate virtue to ward off death, wandering like lost travelers, clinging to foreign places as vast, while despising their homeland as narrow. This is to narrow one’s dwelling.

Prolonging evil harms conduct; indulging desire harms the body. To act thus is to court death, unable to endure long. To weary of life—this is what must be avoided.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis (成疏):** Do not narrow your dwelling, do not weary of your life. *Yàn* (厌) means to abandon; *xiá* (狭) means inferior. *Jū* (居) means to dwell. Your life is the heart. It is said that those who cultivate the Dao must keep the heart unencumbered, not confining emotions to narrow or inferior states, abandoning the source of life. Why? Though the body is empty, it is the vessel for receiving the Dao. One must neither cling to it nor reject it. To cling brings attachment to action; to reject falls into the illusion of emptiness. Neither clinging nor rejecting, dwelling in the middle while forgetting the middle—this is the way of the True Scholar.

Do not weary of your life.

**Commentary (御注):** That which the body generates is the spirit. To not weary is to have few thoughts and desires, avoiding exhaustion.

**Exegesis (御疏):** That which the body generates is the spirit. *Yàn* (厌) means to despise. The spirit is what gives life, hence it is called that which the body generates. The spirit thrives in emptiness and stillness; one must purify the heart and quiet the mind, and the spirit shall return. If one indulges desires, exhausting the spirit’s purity, or engages in frivolous schemes, then *jing* and *qi* shall scatter and dissipate. When they dissipate, death follows. Thus, it is admonished to not weary of the spirit, preserving the way of enduring life.

**Master He Shang’s Saying (河上公曰):** That which sustains life is the spirit, dwelling in emptiness, favoring stillness. If one overeats, neglects the Dao, and indulges in lust, filling the mind with perversity, this is to harm the root and weary the spirit.

Only those who do not weary shall not be wearyed.

**Commentary (御注):** Only those who do not weary the spirit shall find the spirit does not weary of them in return.

**Exegesis (御疏):** The *Dao* lends itself to those who honor it daily. The form is sustained by the spirit. If one loves the Dao and preserves the spirit, it is said, "Only those who do not weary shall not be wearyed." Cleansing impurities and stilling thoughts, being singular and pure, the spirit does not weary of the person—hence, "it is so."

**Master He Shang’s Saying (河上公曰):** Only those who do not weary the spirit—cleansing the heart of filth, serene and desireless—shall find the spirit dwelling within them without weariness.

**Master Rong’s Saying (荣曰):** Life arises from the Dao, form is completed by the spirit. If one loves the Dao and preserves the spirit, it is said, "Only those who do not weary shall not be wearyed." Cleansing impurities and stilling thoughts, the mind becomes tranquil, the form pure. When the spirit attaches to the person and the Dao cherishes them, it is said, "it is so."

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis (成疏):** Only those who cultivate the realm of refinement—neither empty nor substantial—can truly cultivate it. Wisdom neither clings nor rejects; rejection aligns with wisdom, hence it is not wearying.

**Third: Illuminating the Sage’s Proof to Show Taking and Discarding**

Thus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,

**Commentary (御注):** Thus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself, loves himself without arrogance. Knowing his own body, he wards off fearful matters. Loving his own body, he avoids the guilt of wearying the spirit. He does not reveal his abilities to invite misfortune, nor does he exalt himself to gather resentment. Abandon this revealing and exalting; embrace this knowing and loving.

**Exegesis (御疏):** *Zì zhī* (自知) is self-reflection and introspection, preventing harm in its subtlety, ensuring no fearful matters arise. *Bù zì xiàn* (不自见) means not to flaunt one’s talents before others, lest one deviate from reason and invite misfortune.

Thus, **Master Héshàng Gōng** said: The Sage knows himself, and thereby knows his own gains and losses. He does not reveal himself, meaning he does not display his **virtue/power** and beauty outwardly, but keeps them within.

**Róng** said: Therefore, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself, loves himself without arrogance. Thus, he abandons the latter to embrace the former. Ordinary emotions stray from the **Dao/Way**, and so they become **unaware** (無識). The Sage’s wisdom penetrates reason, so he knows himself and forgets the distinctions of self and others, obliterates sensory perceptions, and thus does not reveal himself. **Treasure the spirit and spare the qi**, firmly resolve to cultivate the **Dao/Way**, not lightly squandering this life, hence it is said: love himself without exalting himself, not holding cheap what is small nor despising what is low, acting to benefit others, and in his aspirations, harmonizing high and low. Thus, it is said: he does not exalt himself.

Those who know and love themselves have awakened to reason; those who reveal and exalt themselves are lost in delusion. The Sage speaks of self-transformation to guide all things, making them aware of their proper return. He discards the delusion of revealing and exalting to take up self-knowing and self-loving, thereby preserving his true nature.

**Chéng’s Exegesis (成疏):** His wisdom aligns with the **Dao/Way’s** realm, penetrating the true source of **dharma**. Thus, he knows himself. The four **Great Elements** (四大) are provisionally assembled; through **sitting meditation** (坐忘) and dissolution of the body (隳體), he does not reveal himself.

He loves himself without exalting himself.

**Róng’s Exegesis (御疏):** The Sage cherishes and protects his own body, abstaining from cravings and desires, so that the spirit does not weary, and he does not exalt himself—meaning he does not boast of his own worth, nor oppress others, for such behavior would only gather resentment.

**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: Love himself means to cherish his own body, thereby preserving the **qi**. Not exalt himself means not to seek high status or fame in the world.

**Chéng’s Exegesis (成疏):** Nurturing the true nature of his essence, he does not lightly indulge in sensual desires—this is loving himself. In humility and quiet retreat, he places others before himself—this is not exalting himself.

Therefore, he discards the former to embrace the latter.

**Róng’s Commentary (御注):** Discard the revealing and exalting; take up the knowing and loving.

**Róng’s Exegesis (御疏):** To discard revealing and exalting, to take up knowing and loving—this is the Sage attaining **equanimous wisdom** (平等智), comprehending the **emptiness of **dharma**-nature** (法性空). Reason holds no distinction between taking and discarding; he opens his teachings to guide the ordinary, using metaphorical language to this end.

**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: Discard revealing and exalting, take up knowing and loving.

**Chéng’s Exegesis (成疏):** Discard revealing and exalting, take up knowing and loving—to show all things a mirror of warning, hence the metaphor of taking and discarding.

**Chapter 73: "Courageous and Bold"**

This chapter follows the previous because the prior passage reveals how sentient beings, lacking wisdom, fear neither the **Dharma-net** nor the **Three Paths of Retribution**, thus sinking into suffering. Hence, this chapter emphasizes how the courageous and resolute, through their deeds, return to the cycle of birth and death.

Within this chapter, three distinct teachings unfold:
1. The differing paths of the common and the Sage, with their contrasting benefits and harms;
2. The natural consequences of virtue and licentiousness, arising from **Heavenly Principle** (*天理*);
3. The conclusion that Heaven’s net is vast, yet retribution is without fail.

**First, the differing paths of the common and the Sage, with their contrasting benefits and harms.**

The Sage’s heart, like Heaven’s application of the **Dao**, governs the realm with humility—when kings establish their states, modesty brings radiance, and gentleness yields authority. Yet boldness, when unchecked, invites calamity. Thus, the **Vermilion Emperor** flourished by yielding, while the **White Lord** perished by defiance. Boldness, when reckless, leads to slaughter—this truth is clear. Yet why do people not reflect upon it?

When **Fenglong** raises his voice, he meets the **Summer Emperor** and must sing;
When wild geese take flight, they align with the autumn mist and rise.
Even mindless things respond to the seasons—how much more so should humans, bearing hearts, act without the **Dao** as their guide?

Heaven’s net is unerring; the sun and moon maintain their constancy.
Earth’s **Principle** is without bias—mountains and rivers stand firm, never crumbling into decay,
Nor do they erupt in chaos at the **Tail Interval** (*尾间*).
When the **Way of Gentleness** is vast and **Virtue of Humility** is steadfast,
Responding without speech, arriving without summons,
Even Heaven’s net, though vast, will not fail to record accumulated **virtue and vice**.

**Boldness leads to death; courage tempered by restraint leads to life.**
**Róng’s Commentary:** *Dare* means decisive boldness—when a person acts with reckless resolve, abandoning humility and retreat, it brings ruin. Thus, it leads to death. But restraint preserves life.

**Róng’s Exegesis:** *Courage* is vigor; *dare* is decisive action. Those of rigid strength, fearing nothing, lose humility and retreat, descending into reckless defiance—this is the path of self-destruction. Hence, *"Boldness leads to death."* But when one acts with caution, restraining aggression and avoiding peril, this is the path of self-preservation. Hence, *"Courage tempered by restraint leads to life."*

**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: Boldness leads to death—bold action invites self-ruin. Courage tempered by restraint leads to life—boldness without recklessness preserves one’s life.

**Li Róng** said: Boldness is fearlessness; *dare* is resolute intent. To face blades before one, regarding death as life—that is the courage of the heroic. Yet lacking strategy, strength alone cannot prevail. If one pursues gain recklessly, disaster follows. Hence, it leads to death. But if one acts without contention, guided by **ren** and **virtue**, perhaps through **Dao** to transform others or through wisdom to subdue things—harming none, yet safeguarding oneself—this leads to life.

**Chéng’s Exegesis:** *Courage* is swift action; *dare* is decisive resolve; *death* is annihilation; *life* is longevity. When the heart rushes forward with resolute intent, clinging to worldly affairs, it leads to annihilation. But if the heart remains serene and detached, avoiding attachment, then it attains longevity. Understanding these two paths reveals their differing benefits and harms.

**Róng’s Commentary:** Knowing these two paths—whether beneficial or harmful—what does Heaven abhor? The two paths are *dare* and *not dare*. *Or* means "possessing." Those who know to refrain possess benefit; those who dare possess harm. One must therefore cultivate courage in restraint—this is the way of the truly bold. To act recklessly invites disaster, for this is what Heaven abhors. Who can fathom its intent?

**Róng’s Exegesis:** The two paths are *dare* and *not dare*. When one knows that boldness leads to harm and restraint to benefit, one must cultivate courage in restraint. Though both share the name *courage*, their applications differ—hence, *"or beneficial, or harmful."*

**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: Always knowing these two paths—*dare* and *not dare*—benefit is preserving life; harm is self-destruction.

**Li Róng** said: This refers to death and life.

**Chéng’s Exegesis:** *Or* means indeterminate. The two paths are *dare* and *not dare*. When the heart advances without attachment, it attains longevity—thus, benefit. When the body acts greedily, it returns to annihilation—thus, harm.

**Second, the consequences of virtue and licentiousness, arising from Heavenly Principle.**

What does Heaven abhor, and who can know its intent?

**Róng’s Exegesis:** *Who* means "who." *Intent* means "reason." Those who act boldly invite harm—this is what Heaven’s **Dao** abhors. Yet common folk cannot grasp its reasoning.

**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: What Heaven abhors is reckless action. Who can know its intent and avoid transgression?

**Li Róng** said: Heaven’s **Dao** cherishes life and abhors killing. Yet people often fail to seek benefit or avoid harm—this is ignorance of Heaven’s intent.

**Chéng’s Exegesis:** By nature, Heaven rewards virtue and punishes licentiousness. Examining retribution’s depths, none can fathom its sovereign. Thus, even the Sage finds it difficult.

**Róng’s Commentary:** Even the Sage finds boldness perilous.

**Róng’s Exegesis:** This example of the Sage admonishes the common. Though the Sage’s wisdom makes boldness difficult, fearing its harm, how much more so for the ordinary who would dare it?

**Master Héshàng Gōng** said: The Sage’s virtue, even so, finds boldness arduous. How much more for those without the Sage’s virtue who would attempt it?

The **Dao** of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs.

The **Dao** of Heaven does not compete with things; the four seasons wax and wane, yet none dare defy them. ○
**Róng’s Exegesis:** Since the previous passage spoke of what Heaven abhors, these four lines broadly expound Heaven’s **Dao** of humility, warning against human boldness. People harbor thoughts of victory and defeat, hence the contention; Heaven’s **Dao** is evenhanded, rewarding only the virtuous. None dare defy it, so it is said to triumph through virtue. ○
**Héshàng Gōng** said: Heaven does not contend with humans over nobility and lowliness, yet humans still revere it. ○
**Róng** said: Heaven’s **Dao** is without intent; it does not vie with things, yet naturally holds eminence and precedes all.

The **Dao** of Heaven does not speak, yet virtue responds. ○
**Róng’s Exegesis:** How could Heaven speak? It merely bestows blessings on the virtuous and retribution on the licentious, with omens of good and ill—thus it is said that virtue responds without speech. ○
**Héshàng Gōng** said: Heaven does not call, yet all things move in response to the seasons. ○
**Róng** said: Retribution for crimes and blessings is as certain as an echo; thus it is said that virtue responds. ○
**Chéng’s Exegesis:** The response of blessings and retribution is like an echo—evil and virtue must answer without need of words.

The **Dao** of Heaven does not summon yet things come of their own accord. ○
**Róng’s Exegesis:** The coming of all things is by fate’s decree, yet Heaven does not summon them to obey itself. All things come naturally and follow Heaven’s way—like the yin embracing the yang, spring arises and summer flourishes, none summoned yet they come. ○
**Héshàng Gōng** said: Heaven does not call to all things; they bear yin and turn toward yang. ○
**Róng** said: Spring blooms, winter fades; cold departs, heat arrives. Those who go are not sent away, those who come are not summoned by command. ○
**Chéng’s Exegesis:** Retribution for virtue and vice follows their deeds—no need for summoning, yet it must come.

The **Dao** of Heaven is tranquil yet ever well-planned. ○
**Róng’s Exegesis:** The note says Heaven’s **Dao** is profound and vast, silently vast, symbolically transforming—humans may take it as model, hence it is said to be well-planned. ○
**Héshàng Gōng** said: *Tán* means vast; though Heaven’s **Dao** is wide and boundless, it plans well for human affairs, rewarding virtue and punishing vice, each receiving their due. ○
**Yán** said: Silent and boundless, nothing escapes its design. ○
**Róng** said: The Great **Dao** is most level; thus it is said to be *tán* and *rán*. It weighs human gain and loss, with rewards and punishments without error; it discerns virtue and vice, with calamities and omens never failing—thus it is said to be well-planned. ○
**Chéng’s Exegesis:** *Cóng* means calculation. It speaks of the hidden principles of fate, needing no words to precisely measure deeds and misdeeds, without error.

**Third Paragraph:** Heaven’s net is vast and wide, yet retribution never falters.
Heaven’s net spreads far and wide, yet its rewards and punishments for virtue and vice are never lost, not even by a hair’s breadth. ○
**Róng’s Exegesis:** *Huīhuī*, vast and wide. This passage elucidates the previous meaning of Heaven’s **Dao**. Though Heaven’s net is vast and wide, far-reaching and sparse, its rewards for virtue and punishments for vice never fail, not even by a hair’s breadth. ○
**Héshàng Gōng** said: What Heaven’s net encompasses is vast and boundless; though sparse and distant, it oversees and judges human virtue and vice without error. ○
**Róng** said: It spreads through the boundless void and weaves among manifest forms—both vast and wide, hence *huīhuī*. Crimes are public or private, yet Heaven’s mercy knows no scale; even the slightest offense is recorded, with no oversight in its sparse or dense tracking—thus it is said to never fail.

**Chapter 74: People Do Not Fear Death**
*Chapter on People Not Fearing Death*, thus following the previous. The prior chapter showed how creatures do not fear threats or punishments, yet must face Heaven’s net; hence this chapter follows, revealing that Heaven’s net has its unseen overseers.

This chapter unfolds four themes: First, that creatures are burdened by heavy karmic obstacles and do not fear punishment; Second, that crimes, once deep, will surely invite suffering retribution; Third, that these sufferings are meted out by unseen judges; Fourth, that those who presume to act as Heaven’s judges will instead incur its blame.

**First Theme:** Creatures are burdened by heavy karmic obstacles and do not fear punishment.
Heaven’s **Dao** upholds true names; punishment is natural. Why then do rulers threaten people with death? They wear jade pendants at their belts and display them in times of crisis, clutching golden scepters and wielding them at the court’s threshold. Yī and Lǚ serve as ministers, Píng Bó plots to overthrow. The dynasty’s fate is sealed—when the age of great peace arrives, the ruler’s singular merit alone will earn him the title of *yīràng* sovereign. Then he may drum his belly in the courtyard and strike the earth in the fields, unaware of Heaven’s power, how could he bear the king’s favor?

In May, he wears his winter coat, not envying the lightly clad guest; a foot of cloth is too short, yet he keeps only the upright man. Then he understands the hundred-year fate is all by Heaven’s decree.

In life, gold and jade mark his dwelling, yet he knows the fate of the withered ram; in death, his stone tablet bears gold inscriptions, and Guō Pú foretells it first. Thus the saying: *"Death and life have fate; truly, it is so."*

Now, if one falsely executes punishment to replace Heaven’s judgment, how could such logic be erased? How could the unseen judges agree? It is like a substitute craftsman measuring with a ruler—he will surely suffer injury to his hands.

People are unaccustomed to fearing death—why then do rulers threaten them with it? ○
**Róng’s Exegesis:** If one indulges desires freely, provoking death’s reach, and grows accustomed to it without fear, how could rulers further establish punishments to strike terror through killing?

○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** It speaks of how people cannot uphold the **Dao/Way** of purity and tranquility, instead indulging their passions and provoking death’s grasp. This becomes ingrained habit, and they grow so accustomed that they no longer fear it. Thus, rulers should guide them through the **Dao/Way** of purity and tranquility, yet why do they enforce punishments and killings to instill fear of death?

○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: The people do not fear death because the governance of the state is harsh, leaving them barely able to survive. Those who govern themselves are harmed by their cravings, while greed for wealth destroys their lives—yet the people do not know to fear these things. Why then do rulers threaten them with death, instead of lightening their punishments and teaching them to abandon their desires? Why set punishments and threaten death?

○ **Yán** said: Human nature, when content, finds peace; when discontented, it schemes wrongly. In destitution, one scorns death; in comfort, one cherishes life. If the people’s hearts are not satisfied and their lives are not preserved, then decrees will fail to move them. The beasts of the destitute do not shun rhinoceroses or tigers—such is their nature, and the logic of their plight.

○ **Róng** said: In an age of **Dao/Way**, all beings cherish life, and the **Dao/Way** of non-action makes them spare death. If one cannot pacify them with supreme **virtue/power**, yet restrains them with harsh punishments, the people will barely survive, hence the saying: *"People do not fear death."* The root of people not fearing death lies in cruel punishments; it is fitting to rely on pardon, using **virtue/power** to make them forget punishments. How could one still apply harsh laws to the people, desiring they fear death? This laments the failures of the times.

○ **Chéng’s Annotation (成疏):** This condemns the common delusion of passion, deeply entrenched and unrelenting. They pursue fleeting pleasures without regard for life and death, yet even with stern warnings and teachings, they remain without fear—thus the sigh of *"Why?"* is raised, profound and sorrowful.

Secondly, it clarifies that deep crimes will surely invite suffering retribution. If the people were to constantly fear death, yet one were to act deceitfully, I could seize and kill them—who would dare? **Lord’s Annotation (御注):** If all were to follow the path of purity and restraint, daring not to wallow in passion or indulge desires, and constantly feared death, yet a single deceitful one acted strangely, even if I could seize and kill them, who would dare to do so?

○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** This explains how rulers guide through non-action, and the people temper their desires, each preserving their own lives, and thus fearing death. Yet if one were to act deceitfully and wickedly, and I could seize and kill them, who would dare to do so? The reason they are not killed is that there exists the **Heavenly Net** (天网) that governs retribution—thus the following text states:

○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: If the people were to constantly fear death, it would be because I had removed my own acts of cruelty and taught them to abandon greed. Yet if one were to act deceitfully, I could seize and kill them—who would dare? When **Dao/Way** is used to guide, but the people do not comply, instead acting craftily, they then fall under the **King’s Law** (王法) to be seized and killed. Who would dare to offend?

**Lǎo Zǐ** lamented the times when kings do not first guide with **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, but instead enforce punishments.

○ **Róng** said: The deceitful are those who disrupt the order with cunning. If the age’s ruler upholds the **Dao/Way**, all preserve their lives, and this is called fearing death. Yet those who act violently and disrupt the order grow ever more deceitful and strange in their crimes. Heaven does not endure evil, so they are seized and killed. Those who truly fear death and cultivate life—who would dare to commit wrongs?

○ **Chéng’s Annotation (成疏):** The heart of greed generates ever more deceitful schemes, firmly rooted in perversion, until it becomes their norm. The unseen judges (冥司) capture and kill them, their retribution as sharp as the wind and as evident as the scriptures. If any have insight, who would dare to create sin?

Thirdly, it clarifies that this suffering retribution comes from the unseen judges (冥司). There are always those who govern punishment.

**Lord’s Annotation (御注):** Such deceitful ones are not spared by the **Heavenly Net**—it is the unseen judges of Heaven who kill them. It states that wicked ones are killed by the unseen judges, and rulers, using their authority, seize and kill them conveniently—this is to act as substitutes for the unseen judges.

○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** *Suī* (司) means "master" or "official." Heaven’s discernment is all-pervading, nothing escapes its gaze. Deceitful ones cannot escape their deaths, for it is Heaven’s unseen judges who kill them.

○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: The unseen judges are Heaven, which stands high and surveys all below, overseeing human transgressions. The **Heavenly Net** is vast yet not flawed—this is its nature.

○ **Yán** said: The unseen judges are the great ministers. The **Dao/Way** of the emperor and king is to act without action, delegating duties to those before, behind, left, and right. Those who create calamity die, those who usurp authority perish with their clans, and all officials attend to their duties—none of it concerns the sovereign.

○ **Róng** said: *Suī* (司) means "master." The principles of reward and punishment are constant, and the officials of life and death have their masters. One cannot act wickedly, and those who break the law must die—yet they seek to usurp the unseen judges’ role and kill at will.

Fourthly, it strengthens the argument that substituting for the unseen judges will instead bring one’s own blame. To act as a substitute for the unseen judges is to act as a substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** (大匠).

**Lord’s Annotation (御注):** If rulers delight in seizing and killing themselves, they will not align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**—it is like a clumsy man substituting for the **Grand Master Carpenter** (大匠) in woodwork.

○ **Lord’s Annotation (御疏):** It speaks of how wicked ones are killed by the unseen judges, and rulers, using their authority, seize and kill them conveniently—this is the unseen judges killing people, yet they do not align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, just as a clumsy man substituting for the **Grand Master Carpenter** (大匠) in woodwork.

○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: Heaven’s **Dao/Way** is supremely clear, and the unseen judges have their constants, just as spring brings birth and summer growth, autumn harvest and winter concealment, the stars and Big Dipper shift in their courses to govern the seasons. If rulers desire to substitute for Heaven’s killing, it is like a clumsy man substituting for the **Grand Master Carpenter** (大匠) in woodwork—laboring without success.

○ **Yán** said: The one who substitutes for the unseen judges is the ruler. When officials lose their proper function, governance collapses. When the sovereign takes on self-renewal, skilled laborers fold their hands idle. When the ruler takes on killing, officials lose their proper roles.

○ **Róng** said: To substitute for the unseen judges is to substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork. To substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork, there are few who do not injure their hands. Though Heaven’s **Dao/Way** is distant, its mysterious discernment is profound and clear. Rewarding the virtuous and punishing the wicked is recorded in the unseen judges. Spring brings birth and summer growth, clearly manifest in the seen substitutes. If temporal governance cannot fulfill its role in accordance with Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and instead substitutes with human effort, it also strays from the **Dao/Way**.

Yet even so, most stubborn people are few in following transformation, and many deceitful flaws are difficult to prevent. Adjusting measures according to the times, establishing laws and ordinances, there are those in charge of punishment and officials in charge of killing. If they do not delegate to their proper authorities, and killing is not carried out by its proper officials, but those who usurp killing—it is like a clumsy man substituting for a skilled artisan, bound to bring injury to their hands. Though few may escape injury, those injured will be many.

○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** To substitute for the unseen judges is to substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork. To substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork, there are few who do not injure their hands. All beings create karma and reap their due retribution. Punishments and suffering belong to the unseen judges. The unenlightened, acting from arrogance, presumptuously substitute for the unseen judges in executing punishments—how different is this from an ordinary, clumsy artisan substituting for a master carpenter in woodwork? A clumsy artisan, working beyond their capacity, not only fails in their task but also injures their hands. To forcibly substitute for the unseen judges is the same—it is not merely an abuse of duty but invites disaster. To substitute for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork, there are few who do not injure their hands.

**Lord’s Annotation:** A clumsy man substituting for woodwork—how could he avoid injuring the village [community]? He would also injure his own hands. When a ruler assumes the role of punishment, substituting for the unseen judges, how could he avoid harming the people while also losing Heaven’s harmony?

○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork moves in accordance with the square and round. A clumsy man substituting for him must deviate from the plumb line and level. Could one’s heart not be harmed by the village [community] while injuring their hands? Heaven’s net does not fail, and divine principles are manifest. If a ruler assumes punishment, substituting for the unseen judges, how could he avoid harming the people while losing Heaven’s harmony? Why does he act with such disregard for death?

○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: When a ruler enforces punishments, it is like a clumsy man substituting for the **Grand Master Carpenter** in woodwork—then the square and round will not align, and he will harm himself. To substitute for Heaven in killing is to lose the proper order; if the proper order is lost, he will suffer the consequences.

○ **Yán** said: When skilled laborers fold their hands idle, the great hall cannot be built. When a ruler monopolizes killing, the world loses its proper order. If the great hall cannot be built, there will be no shelter for descendants. If the world loses governance, the state cannot be secure. The chapter on people’s hunger follows the previous one, as the previous chapter clearly establishes that beings with deep karmic guilt must reap suffering. This chapter then explains why such suffering is incurred—due to attachment to worldly actions. Within this chapter, three themes unfold: first, explaining why beings lack virtue due to attachment to worldly affairs; second, why beings shorten their lives due to excessive focus on sustenance; third, demonstrating the beauty of forgetting life to guide learners.

**First, explaining why beings lack virtue due to attachment to worldly affairs:**

The **Dao/Way** and virtue are forgotten when one indulges in worldly pursuits, and thus one attains the leisure of the fish in the lake. As for the benevolent influence of Emperor Wén and Emperor Xīn, the enlightened governance of King Chéng and King Kāng—these were indeed praised as the great blessings of the Zhou. Yet during the Han, when the state was governed by law, the *lǔ* arrows came from the east, and divine forces were invoked from the west. The four classes lived in peace, the people lived without strife, and tribute included eight layers of silk. The fields yielded double harvests of rice, gentle winds blew morning and evening, sweet dew fell in the courtyards. The crown prince’s virtue was abundant in the Green Palace, and ministers assisted in the **Dao/Way** at the Red Gate. Heaven was balanced, Earth was upright, lawsuits ceased, and punishments were clear. The people of Yáo’s time could be sealed in their homes, and those of Shùn’s era thrived in their courtyards. They enjoyed the joy of proper governance—how could there be taxes from hunger? They did not die lightly, and with the sage’s teaching of non-action, they found their own ease.

The people’s hunger arises because their rulers consume too much in taxes. **Lord’s Annotation:** The reason the people of the world suffer hunger and want is that their rulers consume too much in taxes.

○ **Lord’s Annotation:** People are the foundation of the state. If governance is burdensome and taxes are heavy, the people will become impoverished, and the foundation will decay—decay leads to danger. Thus, the people’s insufficiency comes from the ruler consuming too much in taxes, causing their hunger and want.

○ **Hé Shànggōng** said: The people’s hunger arises because their rulers consume too much in taxes. The reason the people suffer hunger and cold is that their rulers consume too much in taxes, hence their hunger. Therefore, the people blame their rulers for greed, abandoning the **Dao/Way** and virtue, and thus they suffer hunger.

○ **Róng** said: When the common people are hungry and the four classes are impoverished, it is not due to other causes—taxes are heavy and levies are excessive.

○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** It says the people’s hunger arises because their rulers consume too much in taxes. Hunger refers to lacking inner virtue. "Upper" refers to the heart, which governs the five viscera and a hundred actions, hence called "upper." Taxes mean accumulation, and "food" refers to tastes. It states that practitioners ruin their virtue by indulging in sensory pleasures. Hence, they suffer hunger—connecting with the previous meaning.

The difficulty in governing the people arises because their rulers engage in worldly affairs, hence the difficulty in governing them. **Lord’s Annotation:** The reason the people of the world are difficult to govern and transform is that their rulers engage in worldly affairs, making governance difficult and deceitful schemes prevalent.

「○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The teeming masses rely on their ruler for governance, for governance is rooted in *wuwei* (無為). Thus, when I practice *wuwei*, the people naturally transform themselves.

Yet the reason people are difficult to govern today is that their rulers engage in worldly affairs. When rulers act, governance becomes burdensome and the people are disturbed; every action spawns great deceit, hence the difficulty in governing them.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng (河上公) says:** The people are difficult to govern because their rulers engage in worldly affairs. The people cannot be governed because their rulers are consumed by desires and fond of worldly actions, hence the difficulty in governing them.

○ **Yán (严) says:** Thus, the people emulate the ruler’s worldly affairs, and their deceitful inclinations make them difficult to govern.

○ **Róng (荣) says:** Worldly actions disrupt the natural order, making governance difficult. When the ruler aligns with *wuwei* (無為), the people naturally transform.

○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** The people are difficult to govern because their ruler engages in worldly affairs, causing all actions to stray and multiply in chaotic ways. This is because the heart indulges in worldly pursuits—when the heart practices *wuwei*, all actions become easy to govern. Thus, one knows that all phenomena rest in the mind alone.

Hence, the difficulty in governing—this concludes the previous meaning.

**Secondly, it illustrates why beings shorten their lifespan: excessive attachment to life.**

The people’s disregard for death stems from their relentless pursuit of life—hence, they lightly embrace death.

○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The people of the world lightly embrace death because they violate natural limits in their excessive pursuit of life, hence they meet their end.

○ **Lord’s Annotation:** The reason people lightly court death and lose their lives is that they violate natural limits, indulging in excessive nourishment and life-preservation. They disregard the law’s penalties, recklessly pursuing their desires—hence, they lightly embrace death.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng says:** The people’s disregard for death arises from their excessive pursuit of life. The people lightly transgress against death because they cling to ways of sustaining life, greedily seeking profit to endanger themselves—hence, they lightly embrace death.

○ **Yán says:** It is because of their excessive pursuit of life that they lightly court death.

○ **Róng says:** Those who cling to life suppress their true nature with false desires, while those who lightly embrace death are ensnared by deluded cravings, clinging to the transient body as if it were eternal. Hence, it speaks of the excessive pursuit of life. Excessive means accumulation, abundance—when affairs accumulate, the mind is disordered; when tastes multiply, vitality wanes. Unable to cherish life with caution, they squander themselves through indulgence and lightly court death.

○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** The people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive attachment to life. Practitioners who do not fulfill their natural lifespan and lightly court death are those who remain entangled in delusion, failing to awaken. They do not comprehend that all phenomena, including life, are illusory—life is but the absence of death. Yet they burden themselves with excessive demands on the six senses and overindulge in the four elements—hence, they lightly embrace death.

This concludes the previous meaning.

**Thirdly, it demonstrates the beauty of forgetting life, urging scholars to reflect.**

Indeed, those who do not excessively cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.

○ **Lord’s Annotation:** When natural sustenance is sufficient, life is preserved. If one overnourishes beyond natural limits, life is lost. Thus, those who do not excessively cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.

○ **Lord’s Annotation:** Life has its bounds—contentment is enough, yet one must neither defy nor overreach them. If one pursues life beyond its proper measure, confusion follows. Thus, not clinging to life preserves it, while excessive pursuit destroys it. Hence, one knows that those who do not make life their concern are wiser than those who vainly prize it.

○ **Master Hé Shànggōng says:** Only those who do not make life their primary concern—who remain untouched by rank and wealth, who do not covet profit or power—can be said to be wiser than those who prize life.

○ **Yán says:** The natural Dao always opposes artificiality. The lifeless attain life, while the living cling to life and meet death. Those who pursue life for its gains are the origin of death; those who abandon life’s attachments are the beginning of true life. Not clinging to others’ concerns brings peace; not clinging to life brings longevity.

○ **Róng says:** Heaven grants life as a finite reality, yet excessive nurturing beyond its measure harms it—this is failing to truly cherish life. Those who grasp the supreme Dao perceive the body as illusory, understanding that governance is lifeless. They do not cling to false forms, naturally releasing the burdens of attachment. They align with emptiness and coldness, harmonizing with virtue, sharing in the Dao’s root. Though they do not nourish life, life nourishes itself—this is truly cherishing life.

Wise (*xián*, 賢) means virtuous; prizing (*guì*, 貴) means valuing.

○ **Chéng’s Annotation:** Wise (*xián*, 賢) means good. Those who attain profound insight do not extinguish sensory existence but instead practice *zuòwàng* (坐忘), realizing life’s formless nature. Hence, those who are repelled by vulgarity and disdain worldly pleasures—who alone do not make life their primary concern—are truly virtuous in safeguarding and valuing life.

**Chapter on the Lifespan of Human Beings**

This chapter follows the previous because the prior illustrates how those who cling to life ultimately court death, while those who forget life achieve longevity. Thus, this chapter explains that gentle and weak beings naturally attain longevity, while the rigid and strong perish early. To distinguish excellence from mediocrity, this is why it follows.

This chapter’s meaning is divided into three parts: first, it presents two paired analogies to contrast life and death in the strong and weak; second, it unites the analogies to argue their superiority and inferiority; third, it uses the analogies and further elaboration to reinforce the meaning.

**First, it presents two paired analogies to contrast life and death in the strong and weak.**

The *Nánchāng* (南昌) adjusts its course, bestowing life on the weak and frail. The *Běidì* (北帝) of *Āngdū* (酆都) holds the register of death, seizing the strong and mighty. The heavens favor the light and yielding, long preserving the moistness of clouds and winds, while the earth’s terrain is solid and enduring—only the sound of metal and stone is heard. Solidity can be shattered, while yielding never stagnates. When the supreme Dao governs, the weak naturally dwell in the lower currents, while the strong suffer mutilation as an omen of misfortune, eye-gouging as a fate of rebellion. Jié Lì (截离) deceived them—why did he kill his own son for another? Dào Zhì (盗婿) was foolish—why did he defy his father and brother, boasting of his valor? Do they not know that all phenomena are transient, and humility and yielding prevail? Without relying on divination, they naturally follow the Dao like Sūn Zhū (孙叔). The waters swirl in the hollows, and withered leaves scatter like wind. The *Jìn Bì* (晋鄙) was buried with an iron hammer, and *Jì Lún* (季伦) met his end with a golden axe. Regret comes too late—whose fault is this?

Better to preserve true purity in tranquil stillness,
where fame and gain are utterly severed—
honor and splendor as fleeting as spring dreams,
wealth and nobility like passing clouds—
then the gentle and yielding attain longevity,
while the empty-hearted ascend as immortals.

Human life begins in yielding softness,
yet ends in rigid strength.
**Commentary:** When life begins, it is soft and weak;
when death comes, it is stiff and hard.
All things—grasses and trees—are tender when they grow,
yet wither and decay when they die.
Thus, those who are rigid and strong are doomed to death,
while those who are yielding and weak belong to life.

The yielding softness of life preserves the harmony of *qi*.
The rigid strength of death scatters the harmony of *qi*.
To clarify: those who guard their yielding softness
preserve life and extend years.
Those who rely on rigid strength
lose their bodies and their nature.

**Explanatory Notes:**
When life begins, the harmony of *qi* flows through all limbs,
making the body soft and weak.
When death comes, the harmony of *qi* disperses,
and the limbs grow stiff and strong.
This is shown to teach that yielding softness and rigid strength
are the warnings of life and death.

**River Master (河上公) says:**
When life begins, it is soft and weak—
the harmony of *qi* is contained within,
and the spirit is embraced.
When death comes, it is rigid and strong—
the harmony of *qi* is exhausted,
and the spirit departs.

**Honor (荣) says:**
Nothing is softer and weaker than *qi*,
and nothing is softer and weaker than the Dao.
Thus, when humans are born, they must rely on the Dao.
If *qi* is preserved, bending and stretching are as one’s will;
if the Dao is upheld, movement and stillness follow the spirit.
The heart obeys without resistance,
and all actions proceed without obstruction—
thus is yielding softness spoken of.
If one cannot preserve *qi*, it will be exhausted,
and the body will perish.
If one does not nurture the spirit, it will depart,
and life will end—
and when life ends, the body perishes,
and movement becomes impossible—
thus is rigid strength spoken of.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):**
When life begins, it is soft and weak;
when death comes, it is rigid and strong.
All things—grasses and trees—are soft and tender when they live,
yet wither and decay when they die.
This is because when alive, the harmony of *qi* is present,
and when dead, the harmony of *qi* departs.
This analogy of sentient and insentient beings
is meant to exhort learners to abandon rigidity and embrace yielding.

**Second Analogy, Distinguishing Superiority and Inferiority:**
All things—grasses and trees—are soft and tender when they grow,
yet wither and decay when they die.
**Explanatory Notes:**
This is an analogy.
When things grow, *qi* gathers, and their branches and leaves unfold in softness.
When they die, *qi* is exhausted, and their stems and branches wither and decay.
Earlier, the sentient was explained;
now, the insentient is illustrated.
The insentient thrive or decay by the gathering or scattering of *qi*,
while the sentient live or die by the presence or absence of the Dao.

**River Master (河上公) says:**
When grasses and trees grow, they are soft and tender—
the harmony of *qi* is present.
When they die, they wither—
the harmony of *qi* departs.

**Honor (荣) says:**
Insentient things live because they have *qi*,
and die because they lack it.
Thus, it is known that sentient beings
retain life through yielding softness and the Dao,
and fall into rigidity and strength when they lose it.
Thus, those who are rigid and strong are doomed to death,
while those who are yielding and weak belong to life.

**Explanatory Notes:**
This concludes the earlier meaning.
Since grasses and trees are soft and tender when alive,
yet rigid and strong when dead,
it is clear that those who act with rigid strength
are of the class of death,
while those who act with yielding softness
are of the class of life.

**River Master (河上公) says:**
Observing these two cases,
one knows that rigid strength leads to death,
while yielding softness leads to life.

**Yan (严) says:**
When life begins, it is soft and weak—
the spirit dwells within the body,
and blood and *qi* flow freely,
making bones weak and sinews supple,
so that movement and stillness, bending and stretching,
are all effortless.
When death comes, the spirit departs from the body,
and the form withers like a dried orange.
The tongue shrinks, the body stiffens—
this is rigidity and strength.
Again, yielding softness is like infancy,
while rigidity and strength are like youth—
when blood and *qi* are at their peak,
decay and old age approach,
bones wither, sinews tighten,
appetite fades,
and death is near.
Rigidity and strength lead to ruin,
while yielding softness grows stronger each day.
Humans are thus, and so are grasses and trees.

**Honor (荣) says:**
This concludes the distinction between sentient and insentient,
life and death,
each with their own categories.

**Master Cheng’s Commentary (成疏):**
"Category" here means "kind."
Thus, those who act with rigid strength
contradict the harmony of nature,
and so belong to the class of death.
Those who act with yielding softness
align with the harmony of *qi*,
and so belong to the class of life.
This is the analogy.

**Third Method: Presenting the Affliction and Reinforcing the Earlier Meaning:**
Thus, armies that rely on strength do not conquer.
**Commentary:** Those who pity prevail,
so those who depend on strength must fail.

**Explanatory Notes:**
This continues to reinforce the earlier meaning.
In warfare, it is said that mercy is the foundation,
hence, "armies that rely on strength are ineffective."
This is to show that those who rely on strength in life
are doomed to die.

**River Master (河上公) says:**
Strong armies are reckless in battle,
delight in killing,
and spread hatred and resentment.
The weak unite against them,
and thus the strong do not conquer.

**Yan (严) says:**
Enemies who rely on strength
plunder lands and wealth,
destroy ancestral temples,
and ruin the state,
seeking to display their might.
Those who oppose them die,
and those who serve them face ruin.
In life, they are a scourge to the world;
in death, they benefit the world.
The weak unite against them,
and the strong are isolated—
thus, they do not conquer.

**Honor (荣) says:**
Thus, armies that rely on strength do not conquer,
and rigid trees are prone to splitting.
If one does not rely on virtue to endure,
but instead depends on arms for strength,
then strength becomes a scourge to the world,
and killing is what all detest.
The few unite against the many,
and the weak support the weak—
thus, the strong are attacked from all sides,
and do not conquer.
This is why rigid trees split,
and strong pillars collapse beneath their weight.
Through such analogies,
it is made clear that one should cultivate virtue
and embrace yielding softness,
rather than adorn oneself with arms and rigidity.

**○ Cheng Shu’s Commentary:**
Thus, armies that are strong do not conquer, and rigid trees are prone to collapse—*armies* referring to the Three Poisons and the Six Roots. It speaks of those who indulge the Six Passions, violently oppress others, and take without restraint—such men will inevitably suffer grave calamity and ruin, hence they do not conquer.

Like coarse, rigid trees, their branches press downward upon them, just as grand beams and rafters bear weight above. Thus, rigidity invites collapse.

**Yu Zhu’s Annotation:**
The root of the tree is strong and great, so it rests below, while the branches, being supple and weak, grow above. This is why the weak and yielding occupy the upper position, while the strong and rigid are beneath.

**Yu Shu:**
It states: *"The root of the tree is strong and great, so it rests below; the branches, being supple and weak, grow above."* This is taken to mean that the weak and yielding occupy the upper position, while the strong and rigid are beneath—that is why the following passage states as such.

**He Shang Gong says:**
The tree is strong and great, yet its branches grow above it. The strong and great are beneath, while the weak and yielding are above.

**Yu Shu:**
This concludes the meaning of the previous passage—that the root of the tree is strong and great, yet its branches grow above it. It seeks to illustrate that those who are strong and rigid are always beneath the weak and yielding.

**He Shang Gong says:**
When constructing works and achieving feats, great trees are placed below, while lesser things are placed above. This is the natural order of Heaven—suppressing the strong and aiding the weak.

**Yan says:**
The Dao of the Divine and Mysterious: the small does not bear the great, the light does not bear the heavy. Why? Because the strong man is a burden to the world. Strong trees, rooted below, wither from the base—this clearly shows that the strong man cannot become king.

**Rong says:**
Life is what all delight in; the weak and yielding are the companions of life—are they not above? Death is what all lament; the firm and strong are the companions of death—are they not below?

**Cheng Shu:**
Firm and strong trees dwell beneath, while supple branches rise above. Thus, the firm and strong man resides in the Nine Abysses below, while the weak and yielding scholar ascends to the Three Purities above.

---
**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**
This chapter follows the previous one, which expounded on the superiority and inferiority of hardness and softness, urging people to learn. Thus, this chapter further elucidates the principles of gain and loss in hardness and softness to encourage study. Within this chapter, the meaning is divided into three parts: first, an introductory analogy illustrating high and low; second, a direct exposition expounding on gain and loss; third, citing the Sage to conclude the meaning.

**First: The Introductory Analogy, Briefly Illustrating High and Low**
The common folk are ignorant; direct speech is difficult to grasp. One must use analogies to make it clear. The Dao of Heaven is boundless and intangible, beyond the reach of human perception. To comprehend its intent, consider the archer’s bow: whether high or low, it strikes true; whether near or far, it finds its mark. Zhang Heng’s skill moved the wind and birds ten thousand *li* away; Emperor Wu’s talent startled the clouds and geese across three autumns. They respond to the moment, never missing their mark. The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive, while human affairs reduce the deficient. Heaven and man employ opposite methods—gain and loss diverge. Who can fathom the primordial *qi*, vast and unfathomable, the Mysterious Origin, remote and boundless? Within it lies true stillness, yet transformation arises spontaneously. It does not rely on man to aid Heaven, nor does it depend on the mind to diminish the Dao.

Soaring nine *wan* *li* on the wind, the Great Peng flies freely; plunging three thousand *li* into the waters, the *Kun* swims alone. Speaking of the bow and arrows, all shots find their mark; speaking of suppression and elevation, none exceed their place. Like the *xiao* flute, when Princess Pingyu plays, the floating clouds are ensnared; like the *qin* zither, when played by the Maoshan recluse, flowing waters become melody. This is the harmony of heart and reason, attainable and complete—only the man of the Dao can grasp its profound mystery.

Is not the Dao of Heaven like the archer’s bow?

**Yu Zhu’s Annotation:**
The Dao of Heaven is profound and distant; without analogy, it cannot be made clear. Thus, the archer’s bow is cited to reveal its function.

**Yu Shu:**
Here, two analogies are employed. The Dao of Heaven is profound and distant; without analogy, it cannot be made clear. Thus, the archer’s bow is used to manifest Heaven’s virtue. The method of the bow is fully explained below.

**He Shang Gong says:**
The Dao of Heaven is vast and clear; it employs analogies from things to make itself known.

**Rong says:**
Human affairs are near and shallow; one faces them yet cannot discern their essence. The Dao of Heaven is distant and deep; one gazes upward yet cannot perceive its principles. The confused are easily enlightened, but the true path is difficult to understand. Thus, the analogy of the archer’s bow is borrowed to illustrate it.

**Cheng Shu:**
The Dao of Heaven—is it not like the archer’s bow? Those who are high are suppressed, those who are low are elevated—this is the analogy. The natural order, like the bow, raises the low to make them high and suppresses the high to make them low. Only when high and low are properly balanced can the arrow be released.

Those who are high are suppressed, those who are low are elevated; the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.

**Yu Zhu’s Annotation:**
The bow must be drawn thus to strike true—just as the Dao of Heaven, through humility and moderation, seeks to guide the ruler in harmonizing with Heaven and people.

**Yu Shu:**
The bow’s function requires proper tension and alignment, ensuring the bowstring is neither too tight nor too slack. To suppress the high and elevate the low is to prepare the arrow for its true path. To diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient is to adjust for distance—thus, the shot finds its mark.

The Dao of Heaven is the same: the sun and moon, cold and heat, come and go in turn. When they come, they diminish the excessive; when they depart, they supplement the deficient—thus, the year’s work is complete.

The ruler must follow the Dao of Heaven: suppress the strong, aid the weak, diminish the advantageous, and benefit the disadvantaged. Thus, the principles of humility and moderation are held up, urging the ruler to govern with equity and balance.

**He Shang Gong says:**
It speaks of the bow’s harmonious balance—only thus can it be used. To suppress the high and elevate the low, to diminish the strong and supplement the weak—this is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

**Yan says:**
The bow’s function lies in harmony. If the bowstring is too taut, it must be loosened; if too slack, it must be tightened.

The rest is thus: carve away the excessive, and supplement what is deficient. When the bowstring and arrow shaft align in their proper measure, harmony is achieved—thus, the bow can be drawn and the arrow released.

**Rong says:**
The Way of using the bow is this: if it is too high, suppress it so it does not exceed; if too low, elevate it so it does not fall short. Neither exceeding nor falling short—this is the middle standard.

For those who govern the realm, they must diminish the excessive wealth of the rich and augment the deficient wealth of the poor. The poor, receiving aid, are no longer poor; the rich, though diminished, remain rich—this is the middle standard of governance.

Too high risks emptiness and distance; suppress it so it does not become void. Too low risks stagnation and obstruction; elevate it so it does not become blocked. Neither blocked nor void—this aligns with the **Middle Dao**.

**The Second Proper Explanation: Broadly Clarifying Diminish and Supplement.**
The excessive must be diminished; the deficient must be given to.

**Zheng’s Annotation:**
Those who are arrogant and proud with excess must invite ruin; those who are humble and meek with deficiency will be granted blessings. The Dao of Heaven is thus, and so it is likened to drawing the bow.

The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.
Yet the Dao of humanity is not so: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.

**Yu’s Commentary:**
The Great Dao applies equity, aiding the many and benefiting the few. But humanity reverses this, diminishing the deficient instead.

**Yu’s Annotation:**
This clarifies how humanity cannot match Heaven’s diminish and supplement. The words *"aid the many and benefit the few"* are from the *I Ching*’s **"Qian" (谦, Humility) Hexagram**.

**He Shang Gong says:**
The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient. The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and benefits the humble, always valuing harmony and moderation as supreme.

Yet the Dao of humanity is not so—it opposes the Dao of Heaven.
It diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. Common folk diminish the poor to serve the rich, plunder the weak to benefit the strong.

**Rong says:**
The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient, using Heaven’s Dao as an analogy.

Yet the Dao of humanity is not so—it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. This speaks of how humanity’s actions oppose Heaven’s Dao: instead of diminishing the strong and benefiting the weak, it extinguishes the poor and increases the rich.

**Zheng’s Annotation:**
The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient. This is the natural principle of bestowing blessings upon the virtuous and calamities upon the licentious, continuing from what was said earlier.

Yet the Dao of humanity is not so—it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. In human affairs, the inclination is to indulge in licentiousness and deceit, to vie with others in worldly pursuits, thus opposing Heaven’s Dao and reason. They strip the poor and lowly of what little they have, offering it to the wealthy and noble who already possess excess.

Who can truly use their own excess to benefit all under Heaven? Only the **Daoist ruler**.

**Yu’s Commentary:**
Who can use their own excess to aid those deficient across the world? Only the **Daoist ruler** can do so.

**Yu’s Annotation:**
*Who*—meaning *who among men*? The **Laozi** laments that the age cannot follow Heaven’s Dao, yet he seeks to relieve humanity. He magnifies the **Daoist ruler’s virtue**, thus citing Heaven’s Dao to exhort: Who can practice Heaven’s Dao, diminishing their own excess to bestow upon those deficient? Only the **Daoist ruler** can achieve this.

**He Shang Gong says:**
Who can occupy a position of excess and reflect upon their rank and wealth to aid those deficient across the world? Only the **Daoist ruler** can carry this out.

**Rong says:**
Who can model their conduct after Heaven’s Dao, diminishing the excessive and supplementing the humble? The **Daoist ruler** must be capable of such actions.

**Zheng’s Annotation:**
*Who*—meaning *who among men*? Who can possess both wealth and virtue to bestow upon all under Heaven? Only those who embrace the Dao can truly aid others, hence the following line: *"The Sage does not accumulate."*

And it says *"to serve"*—this is to show humility.

**The Third Proper Explanation: Illustrating the Sage and Concluding the Meaning.**
Thus, the Sage acts but does not rely on it.

**Yu’s Commentary:**
The Sage follows Heaven’s Dao, applying equity and balance in his actions. His virtue extends to all, yet he does not claim credit for his deeds.

**Yu’s Annotation:**
This introduces the Sage to validate the earlier notion of the **Daoist ruler**. *"Rely on"* means *"to boast or take pride in."* The Sage, following Heaven’s Dao and applying equity, extends his virtue to all without seeking recognition, hence *"does not rely."*

**He Shang Gong says:**
The Sage acts in virtue and benevolence, not awaiting reward or acknowledgment.

**Rong says:**
Thus, the Sage acts but does not rely on it—his achievements are not his own, and so he is not esteemed for his wisdom. The Sage acts in virtue without expecting reward, accomplishes things without claiming credit—this is why he does so: to conceal his **sage virtue** and obscure his **accomplished talent**, lest the people see his wisdom and ability. Since the ruler acts thus, the subjects follow suit, and the strife for renown is naturally removed; the concern for being overlooked ceases to arise.

**Zheng’s Annotation:**
Thus, the Sage acts but does not rely on it—his achievements are not his own. He does not wish to display his wisdom.

The Sage, embodying the Dao, is always good at rescuing and benefiting others. Though he bestows both wealth and virtue, he does not rely on his efforts. Even with great accomplishments, he does not claim credit—his intent is to exalt humility, to retreat from glory, and to conceal his light and obscure his traces, not desiring that others see his wisdom and ability.

**Achievements without claiming credit.**

**Yu’s Commentary:**
The Sage knows that if he claims credit for his achievements, Heaven will diminish them. Thus, even though his Dao spreads across the world and his deeds benefit all, he attributes the praise to the common people, yet does not claim the credit himself.

**He Shang Gong says:**
When achievements are complete and matters are settled, he does not hold onto his position. He does not wish to display his wisdom.

**Yu’s Commentary:**
This concludes the meaning of *"does not rely"* and *"does not claim."* He who does not wish to display his wisdom—though the Sage may possess abundant inner virtue and fine outward reputation—his reason for not relying on his actions or claiming credit is precisely to conceal his virtue and obscure his name, not desiring that others see his wisdom and ability. This is also the meaning of *"diminishing the excessive."*

**He Shang Gong says:**
He does not desire that people know his own virtue—he conceals his achievements and does not dwell upon them.

**Rong says:**
He fears Heaven and diminishes the excessive.

**Chapter 78: The Soft and the Weak**

This chapter follows the previous one, which debated the merits of strength and softness. Since the prior chapter expounded on diminishing and augmenting, this chapter uses water as an analogy to illustrate the power of softness and weakness.

Within this chapter, the meaning unfolds in three parts: first, the analogy begins, clarifying that softness excels strength and weakness overcomes force; second, the analogy is applied, lamenting the common inability to practice it; third, the Sage is cited as proof, demonstrating the true Dao.

**First, the analogy begins, clarifying that softness excels strength and weakness overcomes force:**
The highest virtue is humble and soft—nothing surpasses water. The great artisan takes his standard from it; the virtuous person’s mind flows like water toward the east into rivers, while Confucius marveled at its ceaseless passage. The southern currents converge at the lowly ditches, and Guo Pu praised its boundless spirit.

When autumn waters first rise, they cannot distinguish between cattle and horses; when winter ice first forms, it listens to the calls of foxes and rabbits. Crossing the Yellow River in a small boat, returning to the sea upon a raft. The virtue of softness and weakness triumphs over hardness and strength—white stones boil in cauldrons of stone until they turn to mud, yellow gold is refined into powder by water’s embrace. All these are the power of water, unmatched by any, making it the sovereign of the world. It must be called *"lonely and solitary"* (孤寡), bearing the filth of the land, yet truly it is auspicious.

Speaking of fish, they do not wish their bodies to grow fat; riding cranes, one must have a slender frame. The noble person exchanges with others in simplicity to compare virtue, while the spirit of clarity is marked by pouring and measuring. A loyal subject can summon wind and rain, and a virtuous wife, if reverent and filial, will have the courtyard fountain flow of itself.

Oh, how vast is water’s meaning!

When one acts, he must dwell in tranquility and harmony, not imposing himself upon others. He must yield and adapt, following the Way of things. Water’s nature is pure and reflective—how can I not take virtue from it?

**The soft and the weak of the world have none greater than water.**
Yet in overcoming hardness and strength, there is none that can surpass it.

**Tang Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary:**
To break hardness with hardness, both must be diminished. But when softness strikes strength, the strong are broken while the soft remain whole. Thus, in overcoming hardness and strength, there is none that can rival water.

**Imperial Exegesis:**
Water’s nature is to descend without contention, moving or still according to the time, conforming to square or round vessels. Therefore, when speaking of the soft and the weak of the world, none surpass water. Yet in overcoming hardness and strength, water cannot be rivaled—though water is soft, it can erode stone, and though stone is hard, it cannot harm water. If hardness attacks hardness, both are damaged; if water attacks stone, stone is worn away while water remains unharmed. Hence, in overcoming hardness and subduing strength, nothing precedes water—this is why it is said that none can surpass it.

**He Shang Gong says:**
The soft and the weak of the world have none greater than water—when contained in a round vessel, it is round; when in a square vessel, it is square. Block it, and it stops; unblock it, and it flows. Yet in overcoming hardness and strength, there is none that can surpass it. Water can embrace mountains and nourish hills, wear away iron and dissolve copper—none can overcome water and achieve success.

**Rong says:**
Observing all things, summarizing all existence, the ultimate soft and weak is water. It dissolves gold and stone, breaks hills and mounds—none can surpass water. In the method of breaking hardness and strength, since water is supreme, there is none to replace it. For governing the body, if one can take humility as virtue and the Dao as application, he can surely break strong adversaries and vanquish the fierce. The Dao must come first, so there is none to replace it. In cultivating oneself, if one can uphold the utmost softness and weakness, he can break the hard and strong. I grasp the principle of dwelling in emptiness and stillness, surpassing all disputes of right and wrong, and only the Dao can prevail—none can substitute for it.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
No thing is as soft and weak as water, and no hardness and strength surpasses gold and stone. Yet water, though soft and weak, has boundless utility, and in overcoming hardness and strength, it is unmatched. The principle of breaking the hard with the soft is the same—its meaning is timeless.

There is none to replace it.

**Imperial Exegesis:**
Though water is the softest, in overcoming hardness and strength, none can replace it. Is this not because it possesses the virtue of non-contention and lacks the desire to hold onto victory? Governing the state and cultivating oneself must also be so.

**He Shang Gong says:**
In overcoming hardness and strength, there is none to replace water.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Water can naturally overcome hardness and strength—this is the unchanging principle of breaking the hard with the soft, a truth that will never fade through the ages.

**Second, the analogy is applied, lamenting the common inability to practice it:**
Though softness overcomes strength and weakness triumphs over force, the world knows it not, nor can it practice it.

**Tang Xuanzong’s Imperial Commentary:**
The Dao of softness and weakness surpasses that of hardness and strength, yet the world knows it not and cannot practice it.

**Imperial Exegesis:**
The Dao of softness and weakness surpasses that of hardness and strength. All people know this principle, but they are confused by their own perceived superiority, valuing themselves above others, and cannot put into practice what they already know. This is why it is said that they cannot practice it.

**He Shang Gong says:**
The triumph of weakness over strength is seen in how water extinguishes fire and how darkness consumes light. The victory of softness over hardness is seen in how the tongue, soft yet flexible, precedes the rigid teeth—teeth are broken before the tongue perishes. The world knows this well: weakness endures, while strength and force are injured. Yet none can practice it, for they are ashamed of humility and prefer the glory of force.

**Rong says:**
Many favor strength and force, few preserve softness and weakness—they cannot retreat in humility, always striving to be first among things.

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
Water can overcome gold and stone, so it is known that softness triumphs over hardness and strength. This is understood by both the wise and the foolish, yet all the world cannot follow it in practice.

The Third [Section] presents the Sage’s proof to establish the true Dao, demonstrating its rectitude.

Thus, the Sage speaks:
*"To bear the filth of the state is called the steward of the ancestral altars.
To bear the state’s misfortunes is called the sovereign of all under Heaven."*

**御注:**
*"To gather the faults of all directions is to bear the filth of the state.
To alone assume the titles of ‘Orphaned, Lonely, and Unworthy’ is to bear the state’s misfortunes.
His virtue thus established, the ancestral altars will be reverently served."*

**御疏:**
*"The Sage’s words are cited to confirm the meaning above—this is the one who practices the Way of softness overcoming hardness.
Filth (*rǔ*) means defilement and disgrace.
If a ruler can contain and bear defilement, taking all the world’s faults upon himself, then people will revere his virtue and not abandon him, and the ancestral altars will be served. Hence, he is called the steward of the ancestral altars.
To bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven—*xiáng* means ‘good.’ If a ruler practices humility and softness, bearing the state’s ills and assuming the titles ‘Orphaned, Lonely, and Unworthy,’ then the Four Seas will turn toward virtue, and he is called the sovereign of all under Heaven."*

**River Upper Master (Hé Shànggōng) says:**
*"Thus, the Sage speaks—this is addressing the subjects below.
To bear the filth of the state and uphold the ancestral altars’ master: if a ruler can bear the state’s turbid defilements, like the rivers and seas not resisting the inflow of streams, then he can long preserve the ancestral altars and be the state’s sovereign.
To bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven—a ruler who takes faults upon himself and bears the calamities of the people can thus reign over all under Heaven."*

**Yán says:**
*"To endure what others find shameful and bear it.
What others hate, when it becomes the people’s great calamity, is not taken as virtue—yet if it leads to the loss of the state, it does not lose the Mandate of Heaven. If it risks one’s life, it does not lose the extinction of blessings.
Thus, if one acts this way, Heaven and Earth bow in deference, and all that is imposed upon him vanishes, while all that is plotted against him submits. All under Heaven becomes tranquil, merging into one domain, and those facing the winds and looking upward are transformed without failing to receive blessings."*

**Róng says:**
*"Embodying the Way of softness and weakness, then nothing is excluded.
Awakening to the realm of profound mystery, then no matter is left unaccommodated.
To contain what is rejected and suppress what is evil is to bear the state’s filth.
To blame oneself and take responsibility is to bear the state’s misfortunes.
This suffices to be the master of all things, hence he is called the sovereign of all under Heaven.
These words invert the common and align with the Dao, hence it is said, ‘Rectitude in speech is as if inverted.’
Filth (*rǔ*) is defilement; *xiáng* is goodness.
Though one may practice self-cultivation amid defilement and purity, defilement and purity are both forgotten. Though one passes through goodness and evil, both are harmonized.
Illuminating the original stillness of one principle, establishing that all phenomena are empty—this suffices to realize the Dao and become the Law-King.
From the perspective of convention, filth and goodness are distinct, and the mind perceives them as real.
From the perspective of the Dao, all is empty, hence it is said to be inverted."*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*"Thus, the Sage bears the filth of the state and is called the steward of the ancestral altars—*guó* means ‘the domain of the state,’ and *rǔ* means ‘disgrace.’
The one who embodies the Dao, dwelling in the world, practices humility, softness, and weakness, reaching the point of yielding and compliance, bearing humiliation without contending with others—this is worthy of being the steward of the ancestral altars to shepherd the people.
To bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven—thus, *bùxiáng* is the same as ‘not good.’
The Sage’s spiritual insight is vast and penetrating, reaching into goodness and evil. If there are misfortunes in the state, he immediately blames himself and takes the faults upon himself—this is worthy of being the sovereign of all under Heaven. The case of Tāng setting fire to his granaries to summon distant aid is an example.
Earlier, it was said that the ancestral altars could be entrusted to the feudal lords; now, it is said that all under Heaven should belong to the sovereign of all under Heaven.
Rectitude in speech is as if inverted."*

**御注:**
*"To bear the filth of the state is to be the steward of the ancestral altars; to bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven. These words, though seemingly inverted, are indeed the true rectitude—hence it is said, ‘Rectitude in speech is as if inverted.’"*

**御疏:**
*"This sentence concludes the preceding text.
To bear the state’s filth and turbidity is to be the steward of the ancestral altars; to bear the state’s misfortunes is to be the sovereign of all under Heaven. His words contradict convention and differ from the common view, hence the Old Master elaborately explains that these are indeed true and genuine words. Though they seem inverted to the common ear, they are trustworthy in practice—but people initially perceive them as inverted."*

**River Upper Master (Hé Shànggōng) says:**
*"These are the words of true rectitude; the world does not understand them, taking them for inverted speech."*

**Yán says:**
*"To hold oneself lightly and others heavily, to be at ease with disgrace—this inverts conventional perception and is the true speech of governance."*

**Master Cheng’s Exegesis:**
*"When speaking in accordance with principle, it seems to invert convention—why? The common people all love goodness and honor, yet now one bears defilement and ills, which seems inverted.
Yet the phrase ‘as if inverted’ (*rú fǎn*) aims to clarify that though it appears inverted, it is not truly so—though it seems inverted, it is not. Though it seems inverted, it is not. It constantly aligns with convention, not truly inverted, yet aligning with convention in truth.
It is said that the profound virtue is deep and distant, contrary to things, and only then does it reach the greatest harmony—this is its meaning."*

**Chapter on Harmonizing Great Grievances (Chapter 79)**
The chapter on *Harmonizing Great Grievances* follows the previous one because the prior chapter broadly expounds on hardness and softness, yet even at its utmost, it has not fully penetrated to forgetfulness. Hence, this chapter follows, dispelling the earlier obscurity to reveal the intent of the *Double Mystery*.

Within this chapter, the meaning unfolds in three distinctions:
1. Though one departs from the two extremes, one has not yet ascended to the Dao’s peak.
2. The Sage’s empty unity and mysterious correspondence with the *Double Mystery*.
3. The distinction between those with virtue and those without, and the difference in letting go of fixation.

**First: Though one departs from the two extremes, one has not yet ascended to the Dao’s peak.**
*"Heaven has no favorites—if one acts, it is good. Great grievances will arise; even if harmonized, there will be no peace.
Thus, the Sage empties his heart to benefit others, holds the left contract without blame, and embraces virtue while overseeing life.
It is like the bright sun ascending to Heaven—all under Heaven is illuminated, and the warm breath of yang stirs the earth, making all things spring.
The burden of strength is vast, yet the Dao of the formless is great—how could one cling to it and merely calculate right and wrong?"*

「Though the Master of the Eastern March inclines his heart toward the Wu and Yue regions, his mind already wanders with the ambition of Jing Ke to gaze southward and emulate the valor of Yan and Qin.
Or perhaps he laments the emptiness of Luochuan, then sings a sorrowful song at Yishui—how much like the painted beauty of the crucian carp, which stirs Zhang Han’s longing to return, or the white deer with its unbroken loyalty, which evokes Liu Cang’s remembrance of old bonds!
One must always attend to the roots, for noble deeds are thus exalted.
Hold the Primordial *qi* in pure unity, and do not let passion flow into the Three Evils.
Embody the true and tranquil stillness, and perceive the profound mysteries of the Dao.
Many are lost in the flickering lamps of the world, while few awaken to the reflection in the mirror—this is the way to verify the Path of Eternal Life and enter its wondrous gate.

To harmonize great grievances, there will inevitably be lingering grievances.

**Commentary:**
*"To harmonize great grievances"* refers to the ruler’s desire to use words and teachings to reconcile the people, eliminating their passions. Hence, it is called *harmonizing great grievances*.
There will inevitably be lingering grievances—once a doctrine is established to guide the people, traces of it must remain, and these traces will still breed grievances. Thus, lingering grievances arise.

**Further Commentary:**
At first, humanity was born with a pure and tranquil mind, but now they are entangled in the dusty realm, straying from the Dao and falling into corruption—all due to the influence of passions. Thus, the greatest grievance for the body is indeed passion.
*Harmonize* means to reconcile and adjust.
The people, already ensnared by passion and thus giving rise to deceit, cannot be transformed by the ruler’s passive non-action. If he instead establishes doctrine and law to curb their treachery and adjust them toward harmony, it is called *harmonizing great grievances*.
Yet lingering grievances remain—once laws and doctrines are set, their traces cannot be entirely erased, and these traces will still provoke grievances. Hence, lingering grievances persist.

**River Master’s Saying:**
To *harmonize great grievances*, one must let the killer face death and the wounder receive punishment—this is the way of mutual retaliation.
There will inevitably be lingering grievances, for those who enforce punishments will lose the people’s trust, and lingering grievances will extend even to the innocent.

**Rong’s Commentary:**
To *harmonize great grievances* is to invite lingering grievances—how can this be considered good? When all things are unified in their natural state, right and wrong dissolve. Yet when distinctions arise and conflicts ensue, great grievances take form.
Thus, rituals include the duty of repaying grievances, and laws prescribe punishments for crimes. Grievances come and go, never ceasing. If one seeks to extinguish them by reconciling and adjusting, it is to invert the natural order—making them follow what is unnatural. When people outwardly comply but inwardly resist, or speak well while harboring ill will, lingering grievances and resentments only grow. This is to invite further evil—how can it be called good?
If one truly desires goodness, it is better to refrain from provoking grievances. If grievances are not provoked, there is no need for reconciliation or adjustment. When both inversion and compliance are forgotten, great grievances naturally cease. Only then, when one does not know what is called good, can it be named *the utmost good*.

**Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Grievances* are oppositions—this encompasses all distinctions of good and evil, presence and absence, and every principle that requires opposition.
Though one may reconcile the oppositions of having and not having, achieving neither having nor not having, and thus harmonize the two extremes into a singular middle, this is still the realm of *Xuan* (the Mysterious), not yet the essence of *Double Mystery*.
This is a state of *non-dependence*, yet one has not yet attained *absolute non-dependence*—this is *dependence on singularity*, not yet *singularity without dependence*. Hence, lingering oppositions remain.
How can this be considered *the utmost good*?

**Commentary:**
Once lingering grievances arise, how can one still claim to act in *the utmost good*?
The traces of laws and doctrines inevitably lead to lingering grievances—thus, how can they be called *the utmost good*? This is merely the nature of goodness in learning, striving to restore the original purity.
If one ascends to the transformation of pure tranquility, doing nothing and attending to nothing, the people will naturally adopt simplicity and sincerity, and the traces of lingering grievances will vanish. Only then can one truly be called *the utmost good*.

**River Master’s Saying:**
If one person sighs in complaint, the harmony of Heaven is lost—how can reconciling grievances be considered *the utmost good*?

**Cheng’s Commentary:**
*How* can this be *the utmost good*?
Though one may abandon the two extremes, one has not yet forgotten the singular middle—thus, how can one fully attain *the utmost good*?

**Second: The Sage’s empty gathering and his wondrous correspondence with the *Double Mystery*.**

Therefore, the Sage holds the *Left Contract* and does not blame the people.
**Commentary:**
*The Left Contract* refers to the mind.
The mind is the *yang* repository, binding with the external realm—thus it is called the *Left Contract*.
The Sage knows that establishing doctrine will inevitably leave traces, and these traces will still breed lingering grievances. Therefore, he holds fast to this mind, making it pure and tranquil, and transforms the people through its power. Thus, their passions are eliminated, and they do not need to be punished—they naturally align with non-action.

**Further Commentary:**
*The Left Contract* refers to the mind.
The mind is the *yang* repository, binding with the external realm—thus it is called the *Left Contract*.
The Sage knows that establishing doctrine will inevitably leave traces, and these traces will still breed lingering grievances. Therefore, he holds fast to this mind, ensuring it does not scatter or become confused, and transforms the people through its power. Thus, their passions are eliminated, and they do not need to be punished—they naturally align with non-action.

**River Master’s Saying:**
Therefore, the Sage holds the *Left Contract*—in ancient times, the Sage held the *Left Contract*, which was a pledge of mutual trust.
Without written laws, they carved contracts and pledges into wood as tokens of faith.
Yet he did not blame the people—only the tokens of the *Left Contract* were enforced; no other punishments were imposed.

**Yan’s Commentary:**
*Contract* is a token of trust.
The Sage holds the Dao’s token and wields the virtue’s pledge, uniting them within himself and not blaming others.
Thus, when he would act, he first aligned with Heaven; when he would move, he verified with the tokens of trust.
He sought faults within himself, never reproached others.
He attributed blame to himself, never to others.

**Rong’s Commentary:**
In ancient times, the Sage carved contracts into wood—the ruler held the left, the subject the right—as tokens of trust.
They bound the people to the contracts and pledges, without further laws or punishments. Hence, it is said that the Sage did not blame the people.

**Cheng’s Commentary:**
*Contract* signifies trust and unity.
*The Left* signifies *yang*—life and generation.
The Sage’s insight into the Dao is profound, like the binding of the Mysterious—his unity of subject and object transcends these four phrases, separating himself from all hundred faults.
Thus, he attains eternal vision and longevity.»

The *Left* is held in *yi*—this is indeed *non-attachment* yet *attachment*.

Just as the sovereign ordinarily grasps the left contract, by which he governs all affairs,
the Sage’s subtle contract embraces the world,
thus he can rectify and guide the myriad peoples,
yet speaks of no blame—
for though the Sage rectifies and guides all beings,
he forgets his virtue,
treating the people as straw dogs.
Hence, he does not demand their gratitude in return.

**The Third Distinction:** The difference between *de* and *non-de* lies in *holding* and *forgetting*.

Thus, the virtuous ruler governs by *contract*,
while the unvirtuous governs by *simplicity*.
**Yu’s Annotation:** *Govern* means *to master*.
*Simplicity* means *to permeate*.
The virtuous ruler masters the *heart-contract*,
and thus the people transform of themselves.
The unvirtuous ruler, unable to empty his heart and forget himself,
seeks only to impose laws to permeate the people—
and where laws are made, harm arises.
Hence, he is without virtue.

**Yu’s Citation:**
The virtuous ruler governs by *contract*—
the virtuous sovereign merely oversees the *contract of trust*.
The unvirtuous ruler governs by *simplicity*—
the unvirtuous sovereign abandons the *contract of trust* and oversees what is lost.

**Yan’s Commentary:**
*Simplicity* may also be read as *slaughter*.
The unvirtuous ruler’s governance brings disorder and chaos;
he does not seek faults within himself,
but only oversees the people’s transgressions,
driving them with harsh punishments—
thus, families bear guilt and crimes abound.
The virtuous ruler, however, determines right and wrong within himself,
distinguishing black from white without action—
before he moves, the world responds;
before he commands, the world complies.

**Rong’s Commentary:**
*Govern* means *to master*.
*Contract* means *unity*.
*Simplicity* means *dispersion*.
The virtuous ruler’s governance stems from his heart,
harmonizing with the Dao of *non-action*,
mysteriously one above, drawing all things below.
His trust is the *contract of unity*.
But if unvirtuous, he fails to practice goodness,
neither holding to the Dao’s *contract*
nor uniting the people—
thus, they scatter.
Within, the virtuous ruler aligns with principle,
hence *governs by contract*;
the unvirtuous defies truth,
hence *governs by simplicity*.

**Cheng’s Citation:**
*Govern* means *to master*.
*Simplicity* means *trace*.
The virtuous ruler’s subtle governance does not cling to names or words,
while the unvirtuous, still entangled in *qi* and form,
cannot penetrate and release—
their traces remain unvanquished,
hence *governs by simplicity*.

The Dao of Heaven knows no favoritism—
it always aligns with the virtuous.
**Yu’s Annotation:**
To govern by *contract* is to remain pure and unspoiled;
to legislate is to bring decay and ruin.
Heaven favors none—
it aids only virtue.
Thus, the sovereign must always cultivate purity through *non-action*,
never legislate and create strife.

**Yu’s Citation:**
Though Heaven’s way is impartial in its bestowal,
it does not deceive the virtuous—
those who govern by *contract* attain purity,
and Heaven blesses their goodness with unending benefit.
But those who legislate bring harm,
and Heaven visits calamity upon them—
who cannot escape?
Is this not proof that Heaven favors none,
aiding only virtue?

**He Shang Gong’s Saying:**
The Dao of Heaven knows no near or far—
it aids only the virtuous,
which is to govern by *contract*.

**Rong’s Commentary:**
Heaven’s way is equal, knowing no near or far.
The wicked stray from the path, thus distant;
the virtuous draw near to truth, thus close.
Speaking of ultimate principle,
it is neither distant nor near—
only those who practice virtue are blessed by Heaven,
hence it is said to *aid the virtuous*.
Yet it aids the virtuous while abandoning the unvirtuous—
thus, one knows that Heaven aids virtue,
not the lack thereof.
If one walks the path of virtue,
virtue naturally returns to them.

**Cheng’s Citation:**
Heaven’s true principle knows no near or far.
The supremely virtuous naturally harmonize with it—
this is the same as holding the left *contract*
and not blaming the people.

**The Chapter on Small States and Few People**
This chapter follows the previous because,
though the prior displayed the two *mysteries*’ essence,
its practice was not yet complete.
Thus, this chapter clarifies entering the great through the small.

Within this chapter, the text unfolds in four layers:
First, it illuminates the *xiao xue* (small learning) person,
who does not enter the realm of dust;
Second, it speaks of emptying the heart to verify principle,
abandoning teaching and forgetting *qi*;
Third, it returns to ancient purity,
harmonizing light and blending with customs;
Fourth, it embodies truth and unites with the Dao,
transcending all comings and goings.

**First Layer: The *xiao xue* Person Does Not Enter the Dusty Realm**
In the age of the Flaming Han,
the sovereign merely harmonized with *endurance and repose*;
in the time of Xi and Nong,
people simply adhered to *non-action*.
They dwelled in caves to avoid wind and frost,
nested in trees to evade summer’s heat.
A woman conceived once every fifteen years,
and lived nearly a hundred before death.
They died piled on kindling,
and lived cradling their food at the breast—
how could there be great states claiming empire,
small states claiming subjecthood,
where officials did not aid in planning,
and Feng Huo did not apply his wisdom?
Who calculated the *shi-bo* tools,
who served as magistrates?

Though they had boats and carriages,
they abandoned them by rivers and plains;
though they had armor and weapons,
they stored them away and did not use them.
The transformation of knotted cords was lofty,
the wind of *ya* music reached its peak—
the old died without mutual visits,
until the later age of chaos and peril,
when kings waged war,
Yin overthrew Xia’s governance,
Zhou invaded the Zhou dynasty,
and Yi Yin carried a cauldron to counsel the release of Jie,
while Liang Si wore a jade to deceive Qin.
Qin Shi Huang demoted King Zhou of Zhou to commoner,
Liu Yu bound Emperor Gong of Jin to a pillar—
ministers usurped the sovereign’s power.
Alas, who could endure it?
How could they know that in the age of the Great Dao,
all embraced the transformation of *non-action*?
Comparing today to antiquity—
how deep the sorrow!

Small states, few people—
let there be *shi-bo* tools, yet unused.

The heart, when it does not seek greatness, is free from greed and rivalry.
The affairs, when not sought in multitude, become simple and easy.
When the Way of simplicity is established,
then the pure winds take root.

Even if there are those with talent and skill,
capable of leading as *shi-bo* officers,
there is no need to employ them.

---
**River Upper Master** said:
Though the Sage governs a great state,
he still considers it small,
practicing frugality without extravagance.
Though the people are many,
he treats them as few,
so they dare not be burdened.

Let the people have *shi-bo* tools,
and let each have their own *bu-qu* and *shi-bo* ranks,
so that nobles and commoners do not encroach upon one another.

Though there are tools for the people,
these tools—referring to the farmer’s implements—
are not used, meaning they are not conscripted
to disrupt the people’s prime seasons.

---
**Yan** said:
A small state has narrow lands and few people,
no unshakable foundations,
but only the peril of precarious reliance.
Yet if governed by the Dao,
it can turn misfortune into blessing.

---
**Rong** said:
The Sage governs the state with the Way of *non-action*.
Whether military implements are few or many—
whether in ranks of *bo* or *thousand*—
they are all unused.
If even small states are thus,
how much more so great states?

---
**Cheng’s Commentary** said:
"State" refers to the domain of the mind.
Thus, "small state" means the mind dwelling in simplicity,
a person of few desires—
this is humility.
The conduct of a small state with few desires:
its "tools" are the six senses and ten evils as weapons.
Though the senses are six,
their uses are boundless.
Speaking of *shi-bo* is to cite their greater numbers,
but "unused" means to still the senses
and not be stained by the dust of the world.

Let the people hold life dear
and not wander far.
**御疏** said:
"Wander" means to migrate.
When customs return to simplicity and frugality,
government is not burdensome or harsh.
The people cherish their lives,
so they hold death dear.
They take root in their occupations,
seeking nothing beyond,
each content in their dwelling,
so they do not migrate far.

---
**River Upper Master** said:
Let the people hold life dear—
if the ruler can bring them benefit and remove harm,
each attaining their place,
then the people will cherish life and responsibility.
Not wandering far—
this is to avoid burdens,
so the people remain settled in their occupations,
and do not stray from their accustomed ways.

---
**Yan** said:
Establish them with virtue and morality,
and the people will rejoice in life and longevity,
not becoming thieves or bandits.
At such times,
there are no bells and drums yet ten thousand are joyful,
no rewards given yet ten thousand are content.
Each remains settled in their dwelling,
not abandoning their homeland,
even with a hundredfold gain,
they would not leave their state.

---
**Rong** said:
When governance encounters crises,
people grow light in their regard for life.
When transformation aligns with *non-action*,
people hold death dear.
Fathers protect their children,
wives do not lose their husbands,
each attains joy in their occupation and settled home,
with no further exile or migration.

---
**Cheng’s Commentary** said:
All actions emphasize stillness,
knowing contentment and guarding one’s portion,
thus attaining the fulfillment of one’s natural years,
without chasing distant realms.

---
**Secondly, it clarifies the empty heart and the realization of principle,
the gathering of teachings and forgetting the raft.**

Though there are boats and carriages,
there is no need to ride them.

**御疏** said:
Boats and carriages were established
to traverse water and land,
to aid in scarcity and surplus.
Since there is no travel,
both boats and carriages are abandoned,
with no purpose for use.
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"In the age of supreme virtue,
mountains have no paths or tunnels,
marshes have no boats or bridges."*

---
**River Upper Master** said:
Pure and unadorned, without indulging in ornate pursuits,
they do not delight in travel or amusement.

---
**The Two Rongs** said:
Water travel requires boats,
land travel requires carriages.
In the age of *non-action*,
mountains have no paths or tunnels,
marshes have no boats or carriages—
cutting off the root and discarding the branches,
what need is there for riding?

---
**Cheng’s Commentary** said:
Boats and carriages refer to the Three Vehicles of teaching.
Boats float on water,
symbolizing teachings that ferry all beings
across the sea of birth and death.
Thus, the *Elevating the Mysterious Classic* says:
*"Long abandoned the sea of birth and death,
cutting off the flow of greed."*

Carriages move on land,
their wheels turning,
symbolizing teachings that transform the vulgar into the sage.
Having attained the principle, one forgets the words,
thus discarding the teachings and not using them.

Though there are armor and weapons,
there is no need to array them.

**御疏** said:
Armies are arrayed
to subdue the unyielding,
to repel enemies.
With virtue practiced above and harmony below,
since hostile attacks cease,
armor and weapons are sheathed and not deployed.

---
**River Upper Master** said:
There is no resentment or hatred in the world.

---
**Rong** said:
Weapons are used to punish the rebellious,
martial might to quell disorder.
Since the ruler practices the Dao above,
the people below love virtue,
naturally conforming to transformation—
what need is there for arraying troops?

---
**Cheng’s Commentary** said:
Though there are the "armor and weapons" of body and mind,
when one collapses the body and sits in forgetfulness,
the objects and their realms become empty—
what need is there for deployment?
This sentence reverses the earlier "tools of *shi-bo* are unused."

Let the people return to knotted cords for use.

**御疏** said:
In ancient times, before writing was invented,
knots in cords recorded events.
Thus, the *Systematic Pivot* says:
*"In the upper antiquity, they governed by knotted cords;
later sages replaced them with written contracts."*
To illustrate the age of knotted cords,
people were pure and unadorned.
Once writing emerged,
deceit and artifice flourished.
Now, to make people forget emotions and desires,
returning to ancient simplicity,
it is said: "Let the people return to knotted cords for use."

---
**River Upper Master** said:
Abandon artifice and return to simplicity,
truth without deceit.

---
**Rong** said:
In ancient times, before writing was created,
knots in cords were used for governance.
Once writing appeared,
corruption grew even more severe.
The Sage’s teaching aims at *non-action*,
singing to make them abandon corruption and return to simplicity,
discarding ornamentation and embracing reality.

---
**Cheng’s Commentary** said:
Having emptied the heart and realized the principle,
discarded teachings and forgotten the raft,
thus relying on knotted cords
to demonstrate a return to the root.
This sentence concludes the earlier "though there are boats and carriages, no need to ride them."

---
**Thirdly, it clarifies returning to antiquity and simplicity,
harmonizing with the light and blending with customs.**

Let their food be sweet,
their clothing beautiful.

「The *Rong*’s Commentary said:
To eat sweetly is to eat in moderation—moderation makes all food sweet.
To dress beautifully is to wear appropriately—appropriateness makes all clothing beautiful.
If not moderate and fitting, even jade-like delicacies and brocade garments
cannot truly be called sweet and beautiful.

**He Shang Gong** said:
*"Sweet their food"* means sweet their coarse meals,
not plundering the people for fine cuisine.
*"Beautiful their clothing"* means beautiful their rough garments,
not prizing the five colors.

**Rong** said:
Sweet their food, beautiful their clothing,
settle their dwellings, delight in their customs—
when people’s desires are unfulfilled,
even jade food and silk brocade are not deemed beautiful.
But when the heart finds contentment,
plain rice and coarse hemp robes suffice as sweetness.
Let **Tao Sheng** and **Da Jun** transform the world,
and all shall eat sweetly without distinction of rank.
Clothing shall have no preference for good or ill,
all garments worn shall be deemed beautiful.
Homes shall know no poverty or wealth,
all dwellings shall be deemed settled.
Villages shall know no excess or want,
all abodes shall be filled with joy.
Since none seek distant migration,
the weak and bereaved shall find no need to wander.

**Cheng’s Commentary** said:
*"Sweet their food"*—flavor attains the Dao.
*"Beautiful their clothing"*—virtue/power shines in the body.
*"Settle their dwellings"*—delight in their customs.
The *Rong*’s Commentary said:
Without desire, their dwellings are settled.
With simplicity transformed, their customs are joyful.
If one pursues desires without restraint,
how could they settle in their dwellings?
Harsh governance and burdens bring only trouble—
how could they then delight in their customs?

**He Shang Gong** said:
*"Settle their dwellings"*—settle in thatched huts,
not favoring ornate houses.
*"Delight in their customs"*—delight in simple and unadorned ways,
not shifting to foreign norms.

**Cheng’s Commentary** said:
*"Settle their dwellings"*—all places are settled,
stillness within motion.
*"Delight in their customs"*—harmonizing with the world’s light,
motion within stillness.

**Fourthly, it illustrates attaining true Dao/Way and harmonizing with its flow,
exceeding all coming and going.**
Neighboring lands face one another,
the sounds of roosters and dogs reach across them—
yet the people, until death, never visit one another.

The *Rong*’s Commentary said:
Neighboring lands face one another—
the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—
this speaks of their closeness.
That the people, until death, never visit one another,
is because each has their own sufficiency,
and nothing more to seek or give.

**He Shang Gong** said:
Neighboring lands face one another,
the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—
this marks proximity.
The people, until death, never visit one another—
this is their lack of emotional attachments.

**Rong** said:
Two lands as neighbors, visible to the eye,
roosters crow and dogs bark, heard by the ear—
from beginning to end, in youth and age,
they never visit one another.
Each person is self-sufficient,
each home holds the Dao.
Thus it is said:
*"People forget the Dao as it spreads,*
*fish forget the rivers and lakes they dwell in."*

**Cheng’s Commentary** said:
Neighboring lands face one another—
*neighbor* means near,
*lands* refers to the realms of life and death,
and the Dao’s domain.
This says that these two realms lie close within the heart,
so they are said to face one another.
The sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—
roosters watch for dawn,
dogs guard through the night—
these teachings serve as warnings against the long night of ignorance,
and calls to the morning of wisdom.
Thus, these teachings are near in expounding the unity of mind,
so they are said to be heard.
That the people, until death, never visit one another—
when one attains true understanding and harmony,
this is the Dao.
The Dao is neither born from life and death,
nor does it depart through any path—
when these two realms merge as one,
there is no coming or going,
no distinction between beginnings and ends.

**Chapter Eighty-One of *Sincere Speech Not Beautiful***

*Sincere Speech*—this chapter is the third section,
its text summarizing earlier themes.
Within this chapter, the meaning is divided into three:
**Firstly, it shows the virtuous/powerful person,
whose wisdom transcends all speech and argument.**
Good medicine tastes bitter,
sincere speech is not beautiful,
great eloquence seems dull,
the learned do not know all.
The Sage scatters Dao/Way to teach the common and foolish,
yet does not hoard it.
He laments the long night of ignorance,
while the foolish and dull remain unaware—
I, like grass, am but one of these common folk,
standing at the edge of the boundless sea of desire,
yet unable to unfurl my ragged robes.
Before the mountain of error, who dares lift a foot?
The owl that neither cries nor flies—
when it rises, it soars to the heavens.
The man who is both foolish and dull—
how could he awaken in a hundred years?

The Sage labors to point out the Great Dao/Way,
but distorts the natural transformations of life.
In darkness, they do not know—
what more can be said?

I have privately observed the utmost sincerity,
refining the self and governing the realm—
above, it ascends to the brilliance of the sun,
soaring through the clouds like a bird.
Below, it cleanses the intestines and washes the heart,
leading many to follow in its path.
To act without effort is the Dao’s honor—
dwelling in the source of harmony and balance,
virtue/power can nourish all things.
The child of a skilled craftsman
must first learn to make his own leather coat—
my disciples embrace the True,
so why do they not gather?

My spirit is weary from yellowed scrolls and shallow learning,
my Dao is impoverished by clear streams.
Day and night, I strive in fear,
never ceasing in sleep or waking.
I regret not attaining the likeness of the Sage,
nor the colors of his teachings.
My wasted bones and tattered soul—
how could my sighs ever end?
Those who share my resolve—
do not forget this heart’s intent.

*Sincere speech is not beautiful—*
The *Rong*’s Commentary said:
*Sincere speech*—this refers to the Sage’s teachings,
truthful and real.
Laozi wished to clarify his established teachings,
to transform and guide all beings,
and truly, these are words of utmost sincerity—
yet they conflict with common ways,
so people deem them not beautiful.

**He Shang Gong** said:
*Sincere speech*—speech that matches reality.
*Not beautiful*—simple and unadorned.

**Rong** said:
Sincere speech is not beautiful,
beautiful speech is not sincere—
speech reveals the heart,
not a matter of idle fabrication.
It seeks true principles,
not flashy words.
Thus it is said: *sincere speech is not beautiful,*
*sweet words lose truth,*
*light promises lack substance.*

**Cheng’s Commentary** said:
*Sincere speech is not beautiful,*
*beautiful speech is not sincere*—
*sincere* means real,
*beautiful* means superficial and gaudy.
The virtuous/powerful person, obscured yet in accord with the Dao,
speaks teachings that are real without ornamentation.
Superficial and gaudy speech—
mere tales from the common world—
deviates from ultimate truth,
so it is not believed.»

「Thus *Zhuangzi* states: *"A dog is not considered good merely because it barks well; a person is not deemed virtuous/powerful merely because of eloquent speech."* **Beautiful speech lacks sincerity.**

**Yu’s Commentary** said:
**Beautiful speech** refers to teachings that are sweet and adorned.
Speech that is excessive in superficiality and conforms to worldly tastes—
though it lacks sincerity and substance—
it cannot transform others.
Thus, *sincere speech is not beautiful*
because **beautiful speech lacks sincerity.**

**Master Gong of the He River** said:
Those who speak in **honeyed beauty**—
their words are **nailed and polished** with ornate phrases.
Those who lack sincerity—
their speech is **decorated with falsehoods**, full of emptiness.

The **good** do not **argue**—
**Yu’s Commentary** said:
The **good** in understanding teachings
lie in **cultivation and practice**—
acting without clinging,
never fixating or obstructing,
thus they do not **argue** for their views.

**Master Gong of the He River** said:
The **good** cultivate themselves in the **Dao/Way**,
without embellishing with **literary refinement**.

**Yan** said:
Those who appear **naive and slow** in speech
are called **not argumentative**—
yet their words are **drawn out and true**,
their silence **deep and trustworthy**,
thus they can **achieve goodness**—
how so?
Their actions **move the heart of Heaven**,
their stillness **aligns with the will of Earth**—
the foundation of the **virtuous/powerful person**,
the longest-lasting of all **conducts**.

**Rong** said:
The **good** do not **argue**,
those who **argue** are not **good**—
**great argumentation seems naive**,
without **labored words or empty rhetoric**—
thus the **good** do not **argue**.
Excessive **partial phrasing**,
overly **prolific speech**,
**argumentative words exhaust truth**—
thus those who **argue** are not **good**.

**Cheng’s Commentary** said:
**Argumentation** means **distinction and separation**.
Those who **grasp the ultimate Dao/Way**,
point to the **horse of Heaven and Earth** with the **unity of One**,
thus have nothing to **distinguish or separate**.
The **Confucian and Mohist debates** on right and wrong—
those who rigidly cling to **self/other duality**—
are indeed those who have not yet **attained the good Dao/Way**.

**Secondly**, it clarifies that the **virtuous/powerful person of highest virtue** engages in **twofold giving**—
**of wealth and of virtue**.

The **good** do not **accumulate**—
**Yu’s Commentary** said:
**Accumulation** means **obstruction and stagnation**.
The **sage** **penetrates the subtle source of principles**,
**deeply understands the nature of dharma**,
**discerns the emptiness of words and teachings**,
and **realizes the void of verbal instruction**.
Since their **understood principles are clear**,
their **spoken teachings are also abandoned**,
thus they **do not accumulate** in those teachings—
hence it is said: *"The sage does not accumulate."*

**Master Gong of the He River** said:
The **sage accumulates virtue, not wealth**,
using **wealth to aid the poor**,
using **virtue to guide the ignorant**.

**Yan** said:
The **sage** **discards argumentation and literary refinement**,
like **void and emptiness**,
holding nothing in **stagnation or accumulation**,
adapting with all things—
thus it is said.

**Rong** said:
The **sage does not accumulate**—
when they give to others, their own **virtue/power grows**,
when they give to others, their own **virtue/power becomes more abundant**—
**not accumulating** means **an empty heart**,
like the **radiance of the sun and moon**,
shining upon all **regions and lands**,
things **obtain their own illumination**,
yet their **light becomes ever more brilliant**—
just as the **sage’s wisdom permeates all things**,
their **dharma-giving is boundless**.

The **rivers and seas** **nourish and moisten**,
**benefiting all creatures**—
things **gain life through them**,
yet their **source never runs dry**—
also like the **sage’s wealth-giving**, which is **never exhausted**.

**Cheng’s Commentary** said:
**Accumulation** means **gathering**.
The **sage** has **wealth to benefit others**,
has **virtue to teach others**,
thus they do not **accumulate**.

When they give to others, their own **virtue/power grows**,
when they give to others, their own **virtue/power becomes more abundant**—
**Yu’s Commentary** said:
**Exhaust** means **complete**.
Though the **sage** does not **stagnate or accumulate** in teachings,
yet **sentient beings** **awaken their wisdom**,
must rely on the **sage’s guidance**.
Thus the **sage** uses **pure and clear rational insight**,
**fully imparting** to the **common and ignorant** for instruction.

In the **sage’s nature of wisdom and penetration**,
there is **no depletion or waste**,
hence it is said: *"The more they give, the more they possess."*
The **annotation** states:
**Self-illumination** refers to **inherent clarity**,
**external illumination** refers to **wisdom gained from teaching**—
the **nature of insight**,
though not **originating from others**,
is said to be **self-illumination**.
The **benefit from teaching**,
not arising **from within themselves**,
is said to be **external illumination**.
Thus, the **sage’s instruction** of the **common and ignorant**,
**their wisdom grows ever clearer and more fluent**,
hence it is said: *"The more they teach, the more abundant their wisdom."*

**Master Gong of the He River** said:
When they give to others, their own **virtue/power grows**,
when they **impart virtue/power and dharma-transformations** to others,
their own **virtue/power and dharma-transformations** grow ever more abundant—
thus they **possess ever more virtue/power**.»

The **Dao** thus declares:
*"When one gives to others, one’s own abundance grows ever greater—
when one distributes wealth and treasures in alms,
one’s own wealth grows ever more abundant,
like the light of sun and moon,
endless without cessation."*

**Master Yan** said:
*"The principle of *wuwei* [non-action] is this:
The more one gives to others, the brighter one’s own virtue/power becomes,
the more one gives to others, the longer one’s own life endures."*

**Master Cheng’s commentary** said:
*"When one gives to others, one’s own virtue/power grows ever greater—
*ji*, meaning ‘exhaustively.’
*Wei*, meaning ‘to transform and bestow.’
It speaks of one’s inherent virtue/power and moral cultivation,
exhaustively imparted to teach others,
without miserliness or pettiness,
thus one’s virtue becomes ever more profound and vast—
this is *virtue-giving*.
When one gives to others, one’s own abundance grows ever greater—
all one’s wealth and treasures,
exhaustively dispersed in alms,
the fruit of one’s merit becomes ever broader—
this is *wealth-giving*."*

**A summary of the highest virtue:**
*"Benefiting others while forgetting one’s own deeds.*
The **Dao of Heaven** benefits without harming."*

**The Imperial Commentary** said:
*"The **Dao of Heaven** nourishes and sustains all things—
this is benefiting.
It takes nothing in return—
this is without harming.
This analogy illustrates how the **Sage’s Way** is vast and beneficial."*

**Master Gong of the He River** said:
*"Heaven nurtures and cherishes all things,
letting them grow great without injury."*

**Master Rong** said:
*"The **Dao of Heaven** benefits by giving life—
it constantly aids others without harm.
Strife arises from the mind,
and from actions born of desire.
The Sage has no mind,
thus naturally no affairs.
When affairs are without affairs,
action is *wuwei*."*

**Master Cheng’s commentary** said:
*"The natural **Dao** generates and nurtures all things,
its benefits vast and boundless—
what harm could there be?
The **Sage’s Way** acts without contention."*

**The Imperial Commentary** said:
*"The **Sage’s Way**—
whatever is done,
does not contend with others.
The Sage holds nothing back,
gives ever more to others—
thus, no contention."*

**Master Gong of the He River** said:
*"The Sage follows Heaven’s **Dao**,
takes no action of his own.
Transformation complete, deeds accomplished,
he does not contend for fame or merit—
thus his sagehood remains whole."*

**Master Cheng’s commentary** said:
*"The Sage’s highest virtue
follows the **Dao**, open and unobstructed,
his actions reaching even the lowest,
his transformation encompassing all ranks.
He guards himself with humility,
achieves success without claiming it,
attributing merit to others—
thus it is said, ‘without contention.’"*

*Thus concludes the twenty-second scroll of the* **Mysterious Virtue Commentary on the* Dao De Jing*.*
