**The Second Interpretation of the Dao De Jing**

**Title:** *Second Interpretation of the Dao De Jing*.
**Attributed to:** Anonymous author of the Tang Dynasty.
**In two volumes.** The source text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Canon of Orthodox Daoism), under the *Dòngshén* (Cavernous Divinity) section, *Yùjué* (Jade Precepts) category.
**Note:** The original *Dao De Jing* lacks chapter divisions; these were added by the editor.

**Preface to the Second Interpretation of the Dao De Jing**

**Statement:** Though matters are myriad in their forms, their principles converge into one.
The Three Teachings share a common foundation, yet their doctrines arise from countless schools.
All seek to uphold antiquity while preserving the present,
to exhaust all falsehood and return to the true.
None fail to mark the fundamental cycles, to hint at their origins,
wishing to make the right right and the wrong wrong,
the white white and the black black.

Yet even as the pure winds of antiquity have faded,
the Dao of Heaven remains the same.
All sages follow in its wake,
and all virtuous scholars stand firm in its corner.
Confucius spoke of those who did not follow the Way,
and Zhuāngzi (丘明) was called one who did not act without reason.
The more one attempts to govern and refine,
the more one falls into complexity and disorder.

Thus, *The Rites* (礼) value great harmony,
and *The Book of Changes* (易) prizes adapting to the times.
Since Heaven speaks not,
from whence does humanity derive its desires?

Within the realm of creation and among all things,
though they follow nature’s course,
each adheres to its inherent essence.
Even the common man may grasp what he can,
yet the sage may still fail to recognize it;
even the common man may act as he will,
yet the sage may still not comprehend it.
How much more so the profound origins and subtle meanings of the Dao,
the refined essence of the Great Way?
How dare one speak lightly,
or rashly claim to have attained its truth?

The author once passed through **Suìzhōu** (遂州),
and saw upon the **Lóngxīng Guān** (龙兴观) stone stele
the engravings of the two *Dao De Jing* (道德二经).
Upon close examination,
they differed from the current text.
Many characters were erroneous,
with no annotations or chapter titles.
Though their matters varied in similarity and difference,
their principles were fundamentally opposed.

The old text says *"to act without relying upon it,"*
yet this one says *"to act while relying upon it."*
The old text says *"do not exalt the worthy,"*
yet this one says *"do not place the worthy above others."*
The old text says *"do not dare to act,"*
yet this one says *"do not dare not to act."*
The old text says *"those who stand on tiptoe cannot stand firm,"*
yet this one says *"those who pant will not endure long."*
The old text says *"the fields are overgrown with weeds,"*
yet this one says *"the fields are full of sprouts."*
The old text says *"much speech,"*
yet this one says *"much hearing."*
The old text says *"without self-interest,"*
yet this one says *"without corpse."* (尸)
The old text says *"not released,"*
yet this one says *"not drained."* (汋)
The old text says *"not conquered,"*
yet this one says *"not filled."* (充)
The old text says *"small freshness,"*
yet this one says *"small stench."* (腥)

Briefly enumerating these ten discrepancies,
not all can be exhaustively listed.
Their meanings, when classified,
naturally have their distinctions.

Later scholars and former sages,
each hold their own perspectives.
Seeing these omissions left behind,
how could they not offer supplementation?

Without measuring the void and emptiness,
following the text to explain it,
divided into two volumes,
named *The Subsequent Explication.*

Not continuing the works of others,
but forming a distinct style of my own.
Who is right, who is wrong—
the world will judge accordingly.

I present this to like-minded readers,
hoping they will not dismiss it lightly.
Respectfully written.

**Title:** *The Subsequent Explication of the Dao De Jing*
**Subtitle:** *The Dao De Jing Subsequent Explication*
**Author:** Anonymous, Tang Dynasty
**Volumes:** Upper and Lower

Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dongshen* section, *Yujue* category.
The original *Jing* lacks chapter divisions; the compiler has supplemented them.

**Volume One of the Dao De Jing Subsequent Explication**
**Dao Jing**
Though this text differs from the old,
its principles are self-contained.
Upon careful examination of its arguments,
there are distinct intentions within.
Future scholars must not rashly alter or compare it lightly.

**Chapter One**
*The Dao that can be spoken of*
is not the eternal Dao.

**Chapter One (continued)**
The character *Dao* is divided into three grades:
The highest *Dao* belongs to the **Non-Action, Nameless Great Dao**,
The middle *Dao* is the **Formed, Nameable Dao**,
The lowest *Dao* refers to the **Ever-Practiced, Applied Dao**.

That which can be named is not the eternal Name.
It too is divided into three grades:
The highest Name is the **Name before Naming**,
The middle Name is the **Name that can be called**,
The lowest Name refers to the **Ever-Practiced, Applied Name**.

Without a Name, the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
At first, there was a Name, the Mother of all things.
Before Heaven and Earth were divided, it was the beginning of the Nameless.
When clarity and turbidity separated—
The clear became Heaven, the turbid became Earth.
Heaven covered, Earth bore, and all things were within them,
Like a mother nurturing her children.
The Mother is the Great Dao itself.

Ever without desire, observe its subtlety;
Ever with desire, observe its peril.
All things in the world—
The Sage observes their essence and origin,
That they arise from the Dao and return to the Dao.
*Jiǎo* means "exhausted," *miào* means "born."
These two, though differing in name, share the same source—
Desire and non-desire both arise from the Dao.
This is called the **Mysterious**.
The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—
The gateway to all subtleties.
Since they share the same source, it is called Mysterious.
Within it lies all subtlety, making it Mysterious again.
All things in the world emerge from this Mysterious gateway.

---

**Chapter Two**
When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
Then ugliness already exists.
After all things emerge from the Mysterious gateway,
There are five colors to dazzle the eyes,
Five tones to strike the ears,
Five flavors to delight the tongue—
This is beauty.
Yet the five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deafen the ears,
The five flavors rot the intestines—
This is ugliness.

When all know goodness as goodness,
Then non-goodness already exists.
Men of the world skillfully devise schemes—
From military strategy to governance,
From the common folk to the ruler,
All craftily establish tactics,
Daily generating countless changes,
Achieving success and establishing affairs,
With applications endless.
Yet schemes first arise in the heart,
Adaptation exhausts oneself,
Success unmade while life is lost,
Affairs unestablished while reputation is ruined—
This is non-goodness.

Being and non-being generate each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Long and short define each other,
High and low depend on each other,
Sounds harmonize,
Departure and arrival follow in sequence.
From non-being comes being,
From being comes non-being,
Where there is difficulty, there is ease,
Where there is long, there is short,
Where there is high, there is low,
Where there is sound, there is voice,
Where there is first, there is last.
They generate and complete each other,
Their forms and influences interdependently arise,
Their harmonies and sequences follow—
These six relations in the world
Never abandon one another.
The later text states: *"The Sage governs by Non-Action,
Thus avoiding these extremes."*

Therefore, the Sage governs by doing nothing,
Teaching without words.
When all things act and flourish,
He does not claim to be their origin,
But precedes them as their servant,
Relying on the Dao.
He does not dwell on success.
Because he does not dwell, he does not depart.
The Sage governs the world by Non-Action,
Without wearying speech,
And all things naturally align.
All things flourish without contention for precedence,
Their actions leaning on the Dao,
Success and affairs established—
He does not reside within them.
If he does not reside, his merit does not fade.

---

**Chapter Three**
Do not exalt the virtuous,
So that people do not contend;
Do not place oneself above those with virtue and ability,
So that people do not vie for position.
Do not prize rare treasures,
So that people do not steal;
Do not hoard rare wealth,
So that there is nothing to steal.
Do not display what is desirable,
So that the heart does not乱 (*luàn*—be disturbed).
When desires do not arise, the mind remains unruffled.

The Sage governs by:
Emptying the mind, filling the belly,
Weakening the will, strengthening the bones.
Empty the mind to align with the Dao,
Fill the belly to cultivate virtue,
Weaken the will to follow nature,
Strengthen the bones to steady the body.
Ever keep the people in ignorance and without desire,
So that the wise dare not act presumptuously.
Ever let the world know Non-Action and non-desire,
And after knowing, they dare not act presumptuously—
This is how the Sage governs the world.
To govern by Non-Action is to govern all.

---

**Chapter Four**
The Dao is boundless yet used without excess,
Deep like the origin of all things.
It dulls sharpness, resolves anger,
Blends its brilliance, aligns with dust,
And remains tranquil as if eternally preserved.

The Dao’s nature is boundless and empty,
Yet when used, it does not overflow—
Its roots profound, the source of all things.
The Sage follows it, and none under Heaven can surpass him.
Thus he dulls sharpness as if foolish,
Resolves anger and remains pure,
Blends his brilliance and shares the common place,
Aligns with dust and remains unassuming—
So he endures tranquilly in the world.

I do not know whose child he is,
Yet he precedes the Emperor.
The Sage stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the Great Dao,
Thus he is not a man’s son.
The Great Dao existed before Heaven and Earth,
And the Sage existed before Heaven and Earth—
Hence, he is called *"the one who precedes the Emperor."*
*"The Emperor"* refers to Heaven and Earth.

---

**Chapter Five**
Heaven and Earth are not benevolent;
They treat all things as straw dogs.
The Sage is not benevolent;
He treats the people as straw dogs.
The Sage follows Heaven and Earth,
Uniting the generation of virtue and power,
Not governing with benevolence,
For the people and all things each have their natural natures.

Between Heaven and Earth,
It is like a *tuóqiào*—
*A tuó* is a bag, *qiào* a tube.
Empty yet unyielding,
Moving yet ever producing.
Much hearing leads to exhaustion of knowledge,
Better to uphold sincerity.

The *tuóqiào* is empty like Heaven and Earth,
Receiving *qi* yet ever producing—
This refers to practicing the Dao.
Much hearing confuses true perception,
Better to uphold sincerity.

---

**Chapter Six**
The *Gu Valley* does not die—
This is called the **Mysterious Feminine**.
The Mysterious Feminine gate—
The root of Heaven and Earth.
Endless, as if ever-present,
Used without exhaustion.

*Gu* means "nourish."
*Xuán* (Mysterious) belongs to the nose, governing life—Heaven.
*Pìn* (Feminine) belongs to the mouth, governing death—Earth.
The nose inhales pure *qi*, the mouth exhales turbid *qi*,
Making their flow continuous,
Cultivating the spirit in tranquility—
Neither taking in externally nor emitting internally—
Thus, there is no labor for life.

「Only the sages and worthies can cultivate it; few in the world are able to practice it.

**Chapter Seven**
Heaven and Earth endure long—
The reason Heaven and Earth can endure long is that they do not generate themselves,
Thus they can endure long.
Heaven and Earth embody the Dao and thereby give birth,
They allow all things to generate naturally,
Thus they can endure long.
Therefore, the sage places himself behind while his deeds advance,
Sets himself aside while his body is preserved.
Because he has no rigid self,
He is thus like the soil and can complete his body.

The sage places his person behind others yet leads them,
Sets himself aside yet upholds the Dao,
Does not lord over all things,
Thus all things rely on him as their lord.

**Chapter Eight**
The highest excellence is like water—
Water excels in benefiting all things yet does not struggle,
It dwells in the evils of all things,
Thus it approaches the Dao.

Water’s nature embodies the Dao,
Its form and substance are gentle and weak—
It flows to high places yet rests in low ones,
Follows the square yet adapts to the round,
All evils converge upon it,
Yet it contains and embraces all things,
Does not contend with anything,
Benefits all things,
Thus it approaches the Dao.

The land is good at being low,
Following the land’s form—
High in effort yet low in result.

The heart is good at being deep,
Water’s heart is empty and void,
Like the Dao’s non-substantiality.

It is good at benevolence,
Water’s nature has benevolent action,
Excels in benefiting and aiding all things.

Its speech is good at trustworthiness,
Responding to things like an echo.

Its governance is good at regulation,
Washing and cleansing all impurities.

Its affairs are good at capability,
Green, yellow, red, and white—
All arise from what is needed.

Its actions are good at timing—
Moving in accordance with the time,
Never losing their appropriateness.

Only because it does not struggle,
Thus it has no blame.
So, when it does not contend with things,
Thus it has no faults or grievances.

**Chapter Nine**
To grasp and fill—
This is not as good as letting it be.
To measure and sharpen—
This cannot be long preserved.
Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can guard them.
Riches and honor lead to arrogance,
Self-inflicting their calamities.

When name is accomplished,
When deed is fulfilled,
Retire the body—
This is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

To hold and act—
Even if one obtains fullness,
It is not as good as stopping.
To measure and discern worldly affairs,
To gain their sharpness—
This is not yet a treasure for the body.
To pile gold and amass jade,
To fill one’s hall with treasures,
One cannot long preserve them.
To rely on riches and honor,
Only to indulge in arrogance and insolence,
One must invite misfortune and blame.

Therefore, the sage accomplishes his deeds and establishes his affairs,
Follows the Dao of Heaven and Earth and withdraws from them.

The Dao fills and empties,
Retreats and reveals—
Its patterns are undefined.

**Chapter Ten**
To carry the spirit and embrace unity—
The Dao can thus remain inseparable.
The spirit is called *hún* (魂),
The form is called *pò* (魄).
The body is like a carriage,
Carrying its spirit and form.

To embrace and guard its unity,
Day and night to tend and nurture,
So that the spirit and form do not depart from the body.

To focus the *qi* and achieve gentleness,
One can be like an infant.
To focus and guard the primal *qi*,
Making it gentle and weak as an infant,
Without distinctions.

To purify and remove the Mysterious,
To preserve the subtle and achieve flawlessness.
To wash and cleanse the subtle mysteries,
Making them without blemish or disease.
Blemish is akin to disease.

To love people and govern the state,
Yet without knowledge—
One should entrust to the Great Dao,
Not awaiting the discernment of knowledge.

To be clear and fourfold,
Yet without action—
To be in accord with non-action.

The Heavenly Gate opens and shuts,
Yet remains feminine.
The Heavenly Gate is the gate of longevity and nourishment.
Always guarding the feminine,
Never becoming the masculine.

To generate and store—
To generate yet not possess,
To act yet not rely,
To grow yet not slaughter—
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.

The sage generates and lengthens his body,
Stores and nourishes his body,
Does not possess his body,
Does not rely on his body,
Does not slaughter or harm his body—
This can be called the Mysterious and Wondrous Virtue.

**Chapter Eleven**
Thirty spokes converge at one hub,
Yet it is the empty space that makes the carriage’s use.
To knead clay and shape vessels,
Yet it is the empty space that makes the vessel’s use.
To pierce doors and windows to make a room,
Yet it is the empty space that makes the room’s use.

To have it for utility,
To have no form for wondrous use.
This explains how the Dao generates being from non-being.

Suppose one constructs a carriage,
With wheels, spokes, and hub—
When it is not yet formed as a carriage,
The mind still holds its use.
Like kneading clay,
This is the method for shaping vessels—
When the vessel is not yet formed,
The mind still holds its use.
Again, like rooms and houses,
When doors, windows, and openings are not yet formed,
The mind still holds their use.

After form arises,
It becomes a means of utility.
Before form arises,
It can be a wondrous use.

**Chapter Twelve**
Five colors blind the eyes—
Blue, yellow, red, white, and black—
If one gazes at external colors,
He loses his true vision,
This is blindness.

Five tones deafen the ears—
*Gōng* (宮), *shāng* (商), *jué* (角), *zhǐ* (征), and *yǔ* (羽)—
If one listens to other sounds,
He loses his true hearing,
This is deafness.

Five flavors dull the palate—
Sour, bitter, sweet, salty, and spicy—
If one indulges in their tastes,
He loses his tranquility and simplicity.

Hunting and gallivanting in the fields drive the heart to madness—
Pursuing and taking the lives of things,
Wandering and dissipating the spirit,
Driving one to frenzy,
Generating greedy and lustful desires.

Rare and coveted goods obstruct proper conduct—
Gold, silver, and precious treasures—
Those who love them obstruct their own upright path.

Therefore, the sage cultivates for the belly, not for the eyes,
Thus he discards the latter to take the former.
To cultivate for the belly is to refine the inner,
To cultivate for the eyes is to refine the outer,
Thus he discards the outer refinement to take the inner cultivation.

**Chapter Thirteen**
Favor and disgrace, honor and humiliation—
These are like sudden alarms.
He holds great calamities as dear as his own body.

What is meant by favor and disgrace?
Favor is low—
When one loses favor, it increases.
To gain it is like an alarm,
To lose it is like an alarm—
Favor and disgrace depend on each other,
Gain and loss both bring alarm.

This is called favor and disgrace being like sudden alarms.

What is meant by holding great calamities as dear as one’s body?
The Five Phases contend and destroy each other,
The Four Great Elements invade and harm each other,
Thus they are great calamities.
The reason I have great calamities is that I have a body.
When I have no body,
What calamities do I have?
Not possessing one’s body,
Not relying on fame and status,
Thus one has no great calamities.

Therefore, one who values his body above the world
Can be entrusted with the world.
One who loves his body above the world
Can be entrusted with the world.

Favor arises from disgrace,
Calamities come from the body itself.
The sage does not rejoice in favor,
Does not fear disgrace,
Thus he has no great calamities.

One who values his body without disgrace
Can be entrusted with the world and its affairs.»

「One who cherishes his body without calamity,
Can entrust the world to him.

This is how a sovereign entrusts the world
And shares governance with the sages and worthies.

**Chapter Fourteen:**
When seen, it is not seen—this is called *leveling* (平, *jì*).
When heard, it is not heard—this is called *reaching the subtle* (达, *xī*).
When sought through extensive knowledge, it cannot be obtained—this is called *the exquisite and mysterious* (妙, *wēi*).
These three cannot be achieved through questioning or scrutiny,
Thus they merge into one *Dao/Way*.

Its highest aspect is not dazzlingly clear,
Its lowest aspect is not obscure.
It is ceaseless like the buzzing of flies,
Yet cannot be named—returning to *nothingness* (無物, *wúwù*).
This is the formless form,
The shapeless image—
Called *the elusive and indistinct* (忽怳物色, *hūhuǎng wùsè*).

Approaching it, one does not see its beginning,
Following it, one does not see its end.
Holding fast to the *Dao/Way* of antiquity and practicing it constantly,
To counter the *doings* (有, *yǒu*) of the present age.
To know the ancient origins and reflect upon them—this is called *the framework of the Dao/Way*.
The great *Dao/Way* cannot be perceived by sight or hearing,
Through exhaustive knowledge or relentless inquiry,
Thus it is unified and sought as one.
In high station, it is not dazzlingly clear,
In low station, it is not doubted or obscured.
Its principle is unbroken,
Returning to the *Dao/Way*—called *nothingness*.
This is the form of form,
The image of images—
Sometimes present, sometimes absent—
Thus it is named *elusive and indistinct*.

The *Dao/Way* has no beginning or end,
Thus one cannot see it when approaching or following.
But holding fast to the *Dao/Way* of antiquity and practicing it constantly,
One may counter the *doings* of the present age.
To know the beginning and end of the *Dao/Way* from antiquity—
This is called *the framework and principles of the Dao/Way*.

**Chapter Fifteen:**
Those of old who were skilled in being a *scholar-official* (士, *shì*)
Were those who cultivated the *Dao/Way*.
Subtle, mysterious, and profound,
Deep beyond comprehension.

Since it is beyond comprehension,
Yet they feigned its appearance:
Cautious as one crossing a river in winter,
With dread and fear.
Like one fearing neighbors on all sides,
Yet appearing composed,
Always conducting oneself with respect and propriety.
Dissolving like ice about to melt and disperse,
Purity like the uncarved block (*朴*, *pǔ*),
Vast like a valley—
A valley can be broad and expansive.
Turbulent like muddy floodwaters.
Muddy waters clarify when still.
Floodwaters reveal order when settled.
Stability generates life when moved gradually.
When the body is at ease, all things flourish.
Those who safeguard this *Dao/Way*
Do not seek fullness.
If one sees this *Dao/Way*, then one will not be full.
Only by not desiring fullness
Can one be depleted yet again restored.

Those of old who were skilled in cultivating the *Dao/Way*
Had profound and mysterious matters,
Concealing their traces and hiding their names.
The common people did not recognize them,
So they feigned demeanor to blend with the times.
Like one crossing a river in winter, full of fear,
Like one dwelling with dread of neighbors,
Like a guest with proper etiquette,
Like ice forming yet ready to disperse,
Like the uncarved block in purity,
Like a valley in its emptiness,
Always like muddy floodwaters.
In muddy floodwaters, clarity emerges when still.
In stability, life arises when moved gradually.
And not seeking fullness,
Always abiding in depletion and obscurity,
They could guard their place within the *Dao/Way*.

**Chapter Sixteen:**
To attain *emptiness* (虚, *xū*) to its utmost extreme,」

「To reach the realm of the *Great Dao/Way* (至大道域, *zhì dà dào yù*),」
It is to hold steadfast to *stillness* (守静, *shǒu jìng*), being profound and thick.

All things arise and flourish together (万物并作兴也, *wàn wù bìng zuò xīng yě*), yet I observe their return (吾以观其复, *wú yǐ guān qí fù*).
The return of all things is called *reversion* (万物所归曰复, *wàn wù suǒ guī yuē fù*).
Things drift and gather (物云云, *wù yún yún*), each having its own source of generation (各有所生, *gè yǒu suǒ shēng*).
Returning to their roots is called *stillness* (归根曰静, *guī gēn yuē jìng*).
When cultivating the *Dao/Way* reaches the utmost extreme of *emptiness* (修道至虚极之处, *xiū dào zhì xū jí zhī chù*), one then sees all things either born or extinguished (乃见万物或生或灭, *nǎi jiàn wàn wù huò shēng huò miè*), and also sees all things drifting and gathering (又见万物云云, *yòu jiàn wàn wù yún yún*), each having its fundamental origin to which they return (尽有根本所归, *jìn yǒu gēn běn suǒ guī*), still returning to *stillness* (还归於静, *huán guī yú jìng).
*Stillness* is called *reversion of vital essence* (静曰复命, *jìng yuē fù mìng*), and *reversion of vital essence* is called *permanence* (复命曰常, *fù mìng yuē cháng*), which does not change or alter (不变易也, *bù biàn yì yě*).
Knowing *permanence* is called *clarity* (知常曰明, *zhī cháng yuē míng*).
Not knowing *permanence* and acting recklessly is perilous (不知常，妄作，凶, *bù zhī cháng, wàng zuò, xiōng*).
Recognizing the *Dao/Way*, one then knows that *allotment of vital essence* is *clarity* (认得其道，乃知分命谓明, *rèn dé qí dào, nǎi zhī fèn mìng wèi míng*).
Seeing the *Dao/Way* as singular (见其道一也, *jiàn qí dào yī yě*), if one does not know *permanence* within the allotment (若不知常於分上, *ruò bù zhī cháng yú fèn shàng*), and recklessly acts beyond it (妄有作为, *wàng yǒu zuò wéi*), this is perilous (是凶, *shì xiōng*).
This is called *transgressing the allotment and acting* (言越分而行也, *yán yuè fèn ér xíng yě*).

Knowing *permanence* allows for *universality* (知常容, *zhī cháng róng*), *universality* can be *public* (容能公, *róng néng gōng*), *public* can *generate* (公能生, *gōng néng shēng*), and *generation* without private intent is *natural* (无私自生, *wú sī zì shēng*).
*Natural* can be *Heavenly* (生能天, *shēng néng tiān*), for it possesses the virtue of nurturing (有长养恩, *yǒu zhǎng yǎng ēn*).
*Heavenly* can be the *Dao/Way* (天能道, *tiān néng dào*), for it embodies and acts in accordance with the *Dao/Way* (体道而行, *tǐ dào ér xíng*).
The *Dao/Way* can endure (道能久, *dào néng jiǔ*), for it is neither born nor extinguished (无生无灭, *wú shēng wú miè*).
Thus, one’s body remains unharmed (没身不殆, *mò shēn bù dài*).
Having known its *permanence*, one can embrace all the joys and dislikes of the world as *public* (能容世上一切好恶曰公, *néng róng shì shàng yīqiè hào wù yuē gōng*).
Reaching *public* without private bias, one can generate all things (至公无私，能生万物, *zhì gōng wú sī, néng shēng wàn wù*), like *Heaven* and the *Dao/Way* sharing the same virtue (如天与道同德, *rú tiān yǔ dào tóng dé*).
Those who know this remain unharmed throughout their lives (知此者终身不见危殆也, *zhī cǐ zhě zhōng shēn bù jiàn wēi dài yě*).

**Chapter Seventeen:**
The *Supreme Sovereign* (太上, *Tài Shàng*),」

The *Supreme Sovereign* (太上, *Tài Shàng*) resides in the highest position—this is called the *Supreme Sovereign*.

The next level, *Knowing* (下知, *Xià Zhī*), understands the nature and emotions of all things. It has its own *Dao/Way* (故有其道, *gù yǒu qí dào*), for it follows the *Dao/Way* of discernment.

The next is *Closeness* (其次, *Qín Zhī*), which can harmonize with all things (能顺万物, *néng shùn wàn wù*), and *Praise* (誉之, *Yù Zhī*), which nurtures what it brings forth (善其所生, *shàn qí suǒ shēng*).

The next is *Fear* (畏之, *Wèi Zhī*), fearing the rise and fall of life and death (有生灭, *yǒu shēng miè*). *Contempt* (侮之, *Wǔ Zhī*) scorns all things, failing to grasp their *Dao/Way* (不得其道, *bù dé qí dào*).

When *trust* is insufficient (信不足, *xìn bù zú*), there arises *untrustworthiness* (有不信, *yǒu bù xìn*), as if one were *valuing words over substance* (其犹贵言, *qí yóu guì yán*). When *achievements* are completed (成功遂事, *chéng gōng suí shì*), the people say, *"The *Supreme Sovereign* acts naturally."* The *sage* observes the chaos of all things, always upholding *trust* and *substance* (常存信贵言), establishing *achievements* and *affairs* (成功立事), so that the people do not know their origin and say, *"This is the natural *Dao/Way*."*

**Chapter Eighteen:**
When the *Great Dao/Way* is abandoned (大道废, *Dà Dào Fèi*), there arise *benevolence* and *righteousness* (有仁义, *yǒu rén yì*).
When *wisdom* emerges (智慧出, *zhì huì chū*), there arises *great deceit* (有大伪, *yǒu dà wěi*).
When the *six relationships* are discordant (六亲不和, *liù qīn bù hé*), there arise *filial piety* and *kindness* (有孝慈, *yǒu xiào cí*).
When the state is in confusion and darkness (国家昏乱, *guó jiā hūn luàn*), there arise *loyal subjects* (有忠臣, *yǒu zhōng chén*).

When the *Great Dao/Way* is in practice (大道之行也, *Dà Dào zhī xíng yě*), there is no *levelness* or *unevenness* (无平陂, *wú píng bī*), no *deceit* or *falsehood* (无诈伪, *wú zhà wěi*), no *nearness* or *distance* (无亲疏, *wú qīn cuō*), no *loyalty* or *filial piety* (无忠孝, *wú zhōng xiào*).

When the *Great Dao/Way* is abandoned (大道之废也, *Dà Dào zhī fèi yě*), there arise *benevolence* and *righteousness*, with the *seven virtues* (七义, *qī yì*) arising from *unevenness* (出於不平, *chū yú bù píng*).
There arises *wisdom*, yet *wisdom* stems from the need to establish words (智慧因於为立言, *zhì huì yīn yú wéi lì yán*).
There arises *filial piety* and *kindness*, yet these stem from the absence of *respect* and *reverence* (孝慈为无敬恭, *xiào cí wéi wú jìng gōng*).
There arise *loyal subjects*, yet this is because the *sovereign* has lost the *Dao/Way* of governance (言主失其治道也, *yán zhǔ shī qí zhì dào yě*).

**Chapter Nineteen:**
Abandon *learning* and *wisdom*, and the people will be a hundred times more *benefited* (利, *lì*).
The *sage* establishes laws and transforms the people (圣人立法化人, *shèng rén lì fǎ huà rén*), while the *wise* devise plans to promote *benefits* (智者设计兴利, *zhì zhě shè zhì xīng lì*).
When there are laws, there will be crimes (有法则有罪, *yǒu fǎ zé yǒu zuì*).
When there are *benefits*, there will be *harm* (有利则有害, *yǒu lì zé yǒu hài*).

Abandon *benevolence* and *righteousness*, and the people will return to *filial piety* and *kindness* (人复孝慈, *rén fù xiào cí*).
*Benevolence* can *assist* things (仁能济物, *rén néng jì wù*), and *righteousness* can *establish* affairs (义可立事, *yì kě lì shì*), yet *assistance* may not always *assist* (济有不济, *jì yǒu bù jì*), and *affairs* may not always be *established* (事有不事, *shì yǒu bù shì*).

Abandon *artifice* and *gain*, and thieves and robbers will cease to exist (盗贼无有, *dào zéi wú yǒu*).
*Artifice* creates *schemes* and *tricks* (巧作机权, *qiǎo zuò jī quán*), while *gain* seduces the world (利美天下, *lì měi tiān xià*).
Thieves follow from *deceit* (贼从奸生, *zéi cóng jiān shēng*), and robbers are tempted by *gain* (盗因利诱, *dào yīn lì yòu*).

These three—*benevolence*, *righteousness*, and *wisdom*—are insufficient to govern as *substance* (文, *wén*), so one must make them have their *proper places* (所属, *suǒ shǔ*).
Thus, one does not rely solely on these three as *governing principles* (文法, *wén fǎ*), but instead establishes separate *teachings* and *commands* (别立教令, *bié lì jiào lìng*), assigning each its proper place (使其各有所属, *shǐ qí gè yǒu suǒ shǔ*).

When one *sees simplicity* (见素, *jiàn sù*) and *embraces plainness* (抱扑, *bào pū*), with *few private desires* (少私, *shǎo sī*) and *scant wants* (寡欲, *guǎ yù*), then the people will align with these four virtues.
*Seeing simplicity* means discarding ornamentation (去华也, *qù huá yě*).
*Embracing plainness* means maintaining pure essence (纯质也, *chún zhì yě*).
*Few private desires* means discarding self (去己也, *qù jǐ yě*).
*Scant wants* means having no worries (无忧也, *wú yōu yě*).

**Chapter Twenty:**
Abandon *learning* and there will be no *worries* (绝学无忧, *jué xué wú yōu*).
*Learning* has its *limitations* (有所不足, *yǒu suǒ bù zú), so abandoning it and holding to the *Dao/Way* leads to no *worries* (守道则无忧, *shǒu dào zé wú yōu*).

The *Yes* (唯, *wéi*) and the *Ah* (阿, *ē*)—how far apart are they?
The *beautiful* (美, *měi*) and the *evil* (恶, *è*)—how different are they?
The *Yes* and *Ah* do not separate (唯诺不相离, *wéi nuò bù xiāng lí*), the *beautiful* and *evil* do not part (美恶不相舍, *měi è bù xiāng shè*).

What people *fear* (人之所畏, *rén zhī suǒ wèi*), one cannot avoid *fearing* (不可不畏, *bù kě bù wèi*).
The paths of *life* and *death* (生死二途, *shēng sǐ èr tú*), before they are seen, cannot but be feared (未见之时, *wèi jiàn zhī shí*).
Yet when one *sees* their *boundlessness* (未央, *wèi yāng*), the *Great Dao/Way* has no *center* or *four directions* (无有中央四方, *wú yǒu zhōng yāng sì fāng*).

---

**Chapter 21**
The bearing of great *virtue/power* (德, *dé*), follows only the *Dao/Way* (道, *dào*).

The *Dao/Way* as a thing—
Only vague and indistinct (唯怳唯惚, *wéi yǎo wéi hú*).
Within its vague and indistinct,
There is a substance (有物),
Within its vague and indistinct,
There are forms (有像).
The *Dao/Way* has no form or substance (无形质, *wú xíng zhì*),
Yet within its presence and absence (於有无之间, *yú yǒu wú zhī jiān*),
It can give birth to things and their images.

Within the profound and dark (窈冥, *yǎo míng*), there is the essence (精, *jīng*),
And within that essence, there is trust (信, *xìn*).
The profound and dark is the *Dao/Way*.
With its true essence sought,
The response is certain,
And trust is never lost.

From ancient times to now,
Its name has not faded (其名不去, *qí míng bù qù*),
For through observation (以阅览, *yǐ yuè lǎn*) it is always seen as good (终未也, *zhōng wèi yě*).
How do I know that the end is ever good?
Because of this:
From ancient times to now,
This method has never been strained,
And through it, all good things are observed.

The *Dao/Way*-knowing sage (圣人, *shèng rén*) understands
That all good things arise naturally from this.

**Chapter 22**
When bent, it is whole (曲则全, *qū zé quán*).
When forced and bent, it stands upright (枉屈也则正, *wǎng qū yě zé zhèng*).
When hollowed, it overflows (洼则盈, *wā zé yíng*).
When worn out, it renews (弊则新, *bì zé xīn*).
When few in number, they are gained (少则得, *shǎo zé dé*).
When many, it brings confusion (多则惑, *duō zé huò*).

Thus, the sage embraces *Oneness* (一, *yī*) as the model for all under heaven.

When one bends oneself, all is accomplished (曲己则事全, *qū jǐ zé shì quán*).
When one forces and bends oneself, one’s conduct becomes upright (枉身则表正, *wǎng shēn zé biǎo zhèng*).
When one hollows and lowers oneself, one overflows (洼浅则盈, *wā xiān zé yíng*).
Thus, when worn out, one renews oneself (故弊则自新, *gù bì zé zì xīn*).
When one seeks little, one gains much (少求则得多, *shǎo qiú zé dé duō*).
When one seeks much, one is confused and troubled (多求则惑乱, *duō qiú zé huò luàn*).
This is why the sage embraces *Oneness* as the model of the *Dao/Way*.

Not asserting oneself, one becomes prominent (不自是，故彰, *bù zì shì, gù zhāng*).
Not displaying oneself, one becomes clear (不自见，故明, *bù zì jiàn, gù míng*).
Not praising oneself, one achieves merit (不自伐，故有功, *bù zì fá, gù yǒu gōng*).
Not boasting, one endures (不自矜，故长, *bù zì jīn, gù zhǎng*).

Not asserting oneself, one cannot be contended with.
The ancients spoke of "when bent, it is whole"—
Was this not true speech?
Thus, it is accomplished and returned to the sage.

When one bends oneself to follow things (曲己从物, *qū jǐ cóng wù*),
Things cannot contend with one.
The ancients practiced this *Dao/Way*—
Was this not true speech?
When matters are accomplished,
The whole returns to the sage.

**Chapter 23**
*Rarely* (希, *xī*) speaks, yet it is natural (言自然, *yán zìrán*).

「也。
　　飘风不终朝，骤雨不终日。
　　孰为此？天地。
　　天地尚不能久，而况於人？
　　道本无言，常贵自然。
　　飘风，猛风也；骤雨，暴雨也。
　　天地尚不能以风雨终日终朝，世人争以言教立事。
　　故从事而道者，道得之；
　　同於德者，德得之；
　　同於失者，道失之。
　　信不足，有不信。
　　随从其道者得其道，随从其德者得其德，随从其失者失其道。
　　但存其信，物无不信，谓不重言也。

**Chapter 24**
The gusting wind does not last a morning,
The sudden rain does not last a day.
Who brings this about? The heavens and earth.
Heaven and earth cannot endure long,
How much less can man?
The Dao/Way is originally speechless,
And always values naturalness.
Gusting wind—violent wind—does not last a morning.
Sudden rain—torrent rain—does not last a day.
Even heaven and earth cannot sustain wind and rain indefinitely,
Yet men strive to impose their words and teachings upon affairs.
Thus, those who act in accordance with the Dao/Way
Gain the Dao/Way;
Those aligned with virtue/power
Gain virtue/power;
Those aligned with failure
Lose the Dao/Way.
Insufficient trust leads to distrust,
Yet if one preserves trust,
All things will trust in turn—
This means not repeating one’s words.

**Chapter 25**
There exists a thing that blends into unity,
Born before heaven and earth.
Silent and vast, it stands alone unchanging,
Circulating endlessly without exhaustion,
It may be called the Mother of the world.
The Dao/Way is originally empty and still,
Without companions or partisans,
It does not alter its course with obscurity or clarity,
Circulating through the world without danger or exhaustion,
Nurturing all things like a mother rears her child.
I do not know its name—
I call it the Dao/Way,
And forcefully name it the Great.
Great means "passing away"—
Passing away means distant things cannot follow,
Distant means "returning"—
Thus, the Dao/Way is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
The King is Great.
The four Great ones within the realm,
And the King holds one of them.
The Dao/Way was born before heaven and earth,
Yet acts after them.
Seeking it, one does not see its form,
Using it, one finds response—
Thus, I forcefully establish its name as the Great.
The Great, when sought, is not obtained—it passes away;
Passing away, when sought, is not obtained—it is distant;
Distant, when sought, is not obtained—it returns.
Return means withdrawing back to the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way stands with heaven and earth,
Yet kings all honor its Greatness,
And return to guard its Dao/Way.
Man follows Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao/Way,
The Dao/Way follows naturalness.
Earth bears all things,
Thus man follows it.
Heaven nourishes all things,
Thus Earth follows it.
The Dao/Way gives birth to heaven and earth,
Thus it is called naturalness.

**Chapter 26**
Heaviness is the root of lightness,
Stillness is the master of agitation.
Lightness and frivolity are branches and leaves,
Heaviness and solidity are the foundation.
Agitation and restlessness are the people,
Stillness and composure are the ruler.
Thus, the sage acts throughout the day without abandoning his baggage.
This means he embraces the Dao/Way and holds virtue/power,
Like one carrying heavy baggage.
Though he has palaces and pavilions of splendor,
He dwells in his chambers with serene detachment.
How much more so for the king of a great realm,
Who bears the weight of the world lightly?
Lightness leads to losing one’s foundation in the Dao/Way,
Agitation leads to losing one’s composure.
If the ruler does not hold heaviness,
He will lose his Dao/Way;
If he is agitated and restless,
He will lose his position.

**Chapter 27**
The good path leaves no trace near,
The good word has no distant reach—
Without tracks or paths,
It arrives everywhere;
Without words or teachings,
It acts everywhere.
Good plans do not require calculations—
There are affairs in the world that cannot be strategized,
Calculations cannot reach them,
Only the Dao/Way knows them.
Good closure has no gates or bars that can be opened,
Good binding has no cords or knots that can be untied.
There are gates, bars, cords, and knots,
Which can be opened or untied—
But those bound and closed by the Dao/Way
Cannot be opened or untied.
Thus, the sage always rescues men without abandoning them,
Always rescues things without abandoning them—
This is the clear principle of succession.
He rescues the unvirtuous with virtue,
Gathering them to return to virtue.
The sage not only rescues men,
He also rescues things—
This is the principle of succession made manifest.
Thus, the virtuous man is the teacher of the unvirtuous,
The unvirtuous man is the resource of the virtuous.
The virtuous man teaches the unvirtuous,
Thus he is called their teacher.
The unvirtuous man, when taught, follows the Dao/Way,
Thus he benefits the virtuous as a resource.
If one does not honor his teacher,
If one does not cherish his resource,
Though his wisdom be vast, he is greatly confused—
There are men in the world who are not teachers,
For they do not cherish the benefit of resources.
Though they possess wisdom,
They are greatly misguided.
This is called the essential mystery—
For teaching men and rescuing things
Is the essential mystery.

**Chapter 28**
Knowing the strong, one guards the weak,
And becomes the path for the world.
Constant virtue/power does not depart,
And returns to the state of the infant.
The strong is forceful, the weak is yielding—
Guarding the weak like a path for all streams,
Then virtue/power does not depart from oneself,
And one remains as feeble as an infant.
Knowing the bright, one guards the dark,
And becomes the model for the world.
Constant virtue/power does not falter—
And returns to the principle of the boundless.
Knowing the pure white,
One guards the obscure and dim—
This is the model.
Again, one does not lend purity and brightness to others,
To make them conform to one’s desires,
But one’s own desires return to the boundless principle.
Knowing the honored, one guards the humiliated,
And becomes the valley for the world.
Constant virtue/power is complete,
And returns to simplicity.
Honor arises from humiliation,
Honor lost returns to humiliation—
Better to guard humiliation.
Humiliation is like a valley,
Receiving the world’s evils,
Thus virtue/power is complete and harmonized with simplicity.
Simplicity disperses to form vessels—
The sage uses it for officials and leaders—
Thus, great governance does not slaughter.
After forming vessels, it returns to simplicity—
Those with great governance do not slaughter the world,
For officials and leaders arise from simplicity and can thus govern.

三十四章
大道泛，其可左右。」

「The Great Dao is vast and overflowing,
with no bounds or limits—
its left and right cannot be fixed.

All things rely on it for birth
yet it does not claim them.
Though its achievements are complete and its functions fulfilled,
it does not name itself.

It is covered by all things yet does not rule them—
thus it may be called *small*;
All things return to it yet it does not rule them—
thus it may be called *great*.

Though all things depend on the Great Dao for birth,
and names and functions are established,
they do not know that these names belong to the Great Dao.

All things rely on the Great Dao,
yet do not depend on its ruler—
thus it is called *small*.

All things ultimately depend on the Great Dao as their ruler—
thus it is called *great*.

The Sage never claims to be *great*—
thus he can achieve true greatness.

The Sage embodies the Great Dao,
yet does not name himself—
thus he fulfills the name of true greatness.

**Thirty-Fifth Chapter**
To grasp the great image,
the Great Dao flows throughout the world.

It goes yet does not harm,
bringing peace and tranquility.

Delighting in the five tones is like stopping at a tavern for food and drink—
a traveler lingers briefly but does not stay long.

The Dao, when expressed in words,
is bland and tasteless;
seen, it is not fully visible;
heard, it is not fully audible;
used, it cannot be exhausted.

The Sage holds fast to the Great Dao,
goes forth to govern the world,
and many find peace and tranquility.

After peace and tranquility,
people grow heavy with joy, music, and feasting—
when joy reaches its peak, sorrow follows;
when rites become excessive, disorder arises.
Thus, the Dao is used to restrain them.

Joy and music are like a traveler stopping at a tavern—
he stays briefly but soon departs.
Better to uphold the bland, tasteless Dao,
for its use is inexhaustible.

*Exhaust* is akin to *complete*.

**Thirty-Sixth Chapter**」

---

To wish to take from it, one must first fully extend it;
First, extend it with the Dao.
To wish to weaken it, one must first fully strengthen it;
First, strengthen it with the Dao.
To wish to discard it, one must first fully establish it;
First, establish it with the Dao.
To wish to seize it, one must first fully bestow it.
First, bestow it with the Dao.
This is called *subtle luminosity*.
This is the *turning-the-palm* Dao—
those who can use this will have no undertakings that fail.
The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.

A fish cannot escape from the depths;
a state with sharp weapons must not display them to others.
The soft and weak are like water,
the hard and strong are like fish—
fish cannot depart from water.
Sharp weapons are soft and weak;
governing a state may display them to others.
The soft and weak seek to act in accordance with principle—
the Dao employs the soft and weak as its sharp weapon.

**Thirty-Seventh Chapter**

The Dao ever acts without action yet nothing remains undone.
If kings and lords could uphold it,
all things would transform spontaneously.
When transformation is about to arise,
I shall govern and steady it with the nameless *Pu*.
The nameless *Pu* will also have no desires;
without desires, it remains tranquil—
and the world will naturally align itself.
The Great Dao originally acts without action,
yet nothing remains undone.
Kings and lords, if they would act to transform all things,
after all things are transformed,
they should return to the *floating* [state].
*Pu* makes people act without action;
without action, there are no desires;
without desires, there is ease and tranquility.
If kings and lords govern with ease and tranquility,
the world will naturally return to the proper Dao.

*End of the Second Scroll of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*
*Beginning of the Third Scroll of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*

**The Classic of Virtue**

Those who expound the Dao say:
The origin of all things is formless—this is the Dao.
The function of all things is manifest—this is Virtue.

Virtue arises from the Dao,
The Dao is fulfilled through Virtue.
The highest Virtue and the highest Dao are one.

To grasp it is to live;
To lose it is to die.

The Sage abides before Virtue and the Dao,
Thus knows neither birth nor death.

Common folk dwell after Virtue and the Dao,
Thus know birth and death.

To grasp it requires no taking;
To lose it is beyond recovery.

To dwell in the absence of Virtue and taking—this is to attain the Dao.
To act and employ—this is to attain Virtue.

How much more so for those who, amid their very existence,
Fail to grasp the floating, boundless nature of Virtue and the Dao,
And drift through life and death, their vital essence wandering—
These are countless, and thus Laozi spoke of the *Dao Jing* and the *De Jing*.

**Chapter 38**
The highest Virtue does not cling to Virtue,
Yet through this very non-clinging, Virtue is employed.
The lowest Virtue does not lose Virtue,
Yet through this very clinging, Virtue is lost.

The Sage of highest Virtue acts without action,
Yet nothing remains undone.
The Sage of lowest Virtue acts with action,
Yet much is left incomplete.

The highest Benevolence acts without action,
Yet nothing remains undone.
The highest Righteousness acts with action,
Yet much is left incomplete.

The highest Benevolence harmonizes with Virtue,
Yet nothing remains to be done.
The highest Righteousness enforces judgments,
Yet there are things to be enforced.

The highest Rites act, yet none respond,
So they forcefully seize and compel.
The highest Rites demand response,
Yet none comply.

*Seizing by force* refers to what is now called *unfurling the arm to take*—
The Rites are the execution of the Five Constants.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, Virtue arises;
When Virtue is lost, Benevolence arises;
When Benevolence is lost, Righteousness arises;
When Righteousness is lost, the Rites arise.

The Rites are the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
Yet they are the beginning of chaos.
When naturalness is lost, Virtue and deeds arise;
When Virtue and deeds are lost, Benevolent actions arise;
When Benevolent actions are lost, the path of Righteousness arises;
When the path of Righteousness is lost, Rites and ceremonies arise.

To uphold Rites and ceremonies is to thin loyalty and trust,
And to lose naturalness—
This is the origin of disorder.

**Foreknowledge** is the flower of the Dao,
Yet it is the beginning of folly.

The foolish of the world see only what is before them,
Not what lies behind;
They covet only the beginning,
Not the end.
It is like a fruit tree—
They love only its blossoms and leaves,
Yet do not take its fruit.

Thus, the true man dwells in substance, not in the thin;
In reality, not in the superficial;
In the weighty, not in the hollow;
In the fruit, not in the flower.

Hence, he discards the latter to take the former—
Discards the flower to take the fruit.

**Chapter 39**
In ancient times, those who attained *Oneness*:
The heavens attained *Oneness* with serene clarity,
The earth attained *Oneness* with tranquil stability,
The spirit attained *Oneness* with luminous responsiveness,
The valleys attained *Oneness* with fullness,
All things attained *Oneness* with flourishing growth,
And kings and lords attained *Oneness* to govern and transform the world.

Yet when *Oneness* is exhausted—
The heavens, without clarity, risk fracturing and ruin,
The earth, without stability, risks erupting and overflowing,
The spirit, without responsiveness, risks fading and vanishing,
The valleys, without fullness, risk draining and emptiness,
All things, without growth, risk perishing and extinction,
And kings and lords, without nobility, risk humiliation and downfall.

Thus, nobility finds its root in humility,
And height finds its foundation in lowliness.
Nobility shines through humility,
Height is revealed through lowliness.

Therefore, lords and kings call themselves *lonely and few*—
*Poor* (孤), like the hub of a wheel,
Where all spokes converge.
Is this not their rooting in humility?
Or is it not?

Thus, when virtue is perfected, there is no praise—
Loneliness and fewness are the true marks.
When lords and kings’ virtue extends to all under heaven,
They count their virtues not to receive praise,
But lest they become polished like jade,
Or rugged like stone.
Jade is scarce and thus noble,
Stone is common and thus lowly—
The virtuous do not seek nobility but seek humility.

**Chapter Forty**
The Way moves by returning,
The weak are the Way’s use.
All things under heaven arise from *Having*,
*Having* arises from *Non-Having*.
Motion and stillness align with the Way,
Softness and weakness embody the Way.
All things are born from *Having*,
Yet return to *Non-Having*.

**Chapter Forty-One**
The superior person hears the Way and strives to practice it;
The mediocre person hears the Way and holds it as if it exists, as if it does not;
The inferior person hears the Way and laughs—
If they do not laugh, it is not the Way.

The superior person is born of pure *qi* and, hearing the Way, strives to practice it;
The mediocre person is born of harmonious *qi* and, hearing the Way, holds it as if it exists, as if it does not;
The inferior person is born of turbid *qi* and knows nothing of the Way.
The Way opposes the common, so it is met with laughter.

There is a saying:
When the Way is first spoken,
Its clarity seems like darkness;
After the Way is made clear,
It seems like perpetual obscurity.
Advancing the Way appears as retreat,
Hiding one’s traces and concealing one’s name
Is how one truly advances the Way.
The Way’s equality is like that of the common,
The great Way is level and just, like ordinary things.
Great virtue seems like the vulgar,
Though virtue resides above, it does not abandon the common.
Great purity seems like shame,
The most virtuous appear as if dishonored.
Great breadth seems insufficient,
Virtue vast as the heavens still seems lacking.
Establishing virtue seems like theft,
Those who build virtue act as if stealing, fearing others’ knowledge.
True substance seems false,
The genuine appears as if corrupted.
The most square has no corners,
The greatest boundaries are boundless.
Great vessels take long to form,
Those who craft the grand cannot rush completion.
The greatest sound is without tone,
The mightiest thunder does not roar endlessly.
The greatest form is shapeless,
The grandest symbol—heaven and earth—has no fixed shape.
The Way is hidden, nameless.
Only the Way
Lends freely and fulfills.

**Chapter Forty-Two**
The Way gives birth to *Oneness*,
*Oneness* gives birth to the Two,
The Two gives birth to the Three,
The Three gives birth to all things.
All things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*,
And through their clashing *qi* find harmony.
What people detest—
Loneliness, fewness, the hub of the wheel—
Is what kings and lords claim as their name.
Thus, some things are diminished to benefit,
And benefited to diminish.
The Way gives birth to *One Qi*,
*One Qi* gives birth to the Two Poles,
The Two Poles give birth to the Three Powers,
The Three Powers give birth to all things.
All things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*,
Using clashing *qi* to harmonize above and below.
Taking loneliness and fewness as the model of kings and lords,
The principle of diminishing and benefiting is the way of all things.
What people teach,
I also teach as my principle.
The overbearing meet no good end.
I shall make them my lesson,
Using the overbearing as a warning
To keep all steadfast in softness and weakness.

**Chapter Forty-Three**
The most gentle under heaven
Overcomes the most rigid under heaven.
Softness overcomes hardness—
There is no entering where there is no gap,
Thus one knows the benefit of *wuwei*.
The teaching of *wuwei* is without words,
Its benefit is without action—
Few under heaven attain it.
*Wuwei* enters where there is no gap,
The benefit of *wuwei* is without action—
Few under heaven attain it.
*Xi* means few.

**Chapter Forty-Five**
What is more cherished—name or body?
What is more abundant—body or wealth?
What brings greater suffering—gain or loss?
Thus, the more one loves excessively, the greater the expenditure;
The more one hoards, the greater the loss.
Therefore, one who knows sufficiency is unshamed,
One who knows restraint is unharmed,
And thus may endure long.

Name is distant, the body is close—
Do not harm the body to pursue name.
The body is few, wealth is much—
Do not forfeit the body to seek wealth.
Gain brings its own suffering, loss brings its own suffering;
Love brings expenditure, hoarding brings loss.
To endure long, know sufficiency and guard your portion—
Then you shall not face peril.

**Chapter Forty-Six**
The fully formed seems incomplete—
Its use is never exhausted.
The utterly full seems empty—
Its use is never depleted.
The perfectly straight seems bent,
The supremely skillful seems clumsy,
The eloquent seem tongue-tied.
Agitation overcomes cold,
Stillness overcomes heat,
And clarity-quietude governs the world.

When virtue and power are complete,
To be called deficient and yielding is proper—
Thus its use is never exhausted or depleted,
So the straight seems bent,
Skill seems clumsiness,
Eloquence seems speechlessness.
Agitation and heat are names for disturbance,
Cold and stillness are the realm of non-action—
The foundation of true principle.

**Chapter Forty-Seven**
When the Way prevails in the world,
Warhorses are used for plowing fields.
When the Way does not prevail,
Warhorses and arms arise in the suburbs.
A ruler who follows the Way
Does not use warhorses but tends the fields.
When the Way is lost,
Warhorses fill the countryside—
This is the love of arms.
To tend the fields is to encourage agriculture;
To love arms is to harm the people.
No guilt is greater than desiring what is forbidden,
No calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,
No blame is worse than greed.
Thus, sufficiency’s sufficiency is always sufficient.
The guilt of desire is the pursuit of one’s will—
Disaster and blame fall upon oneself.
If one does not know sufficiency,
It is the love of greed.
Thus, knowing sufficiency,
All things are sufficient.

**Chapter Forty-Eight**
Not stepping outside, one knows the world;
Not peering through windows, one sees the Way.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus the Sage acts without going yet knows,
Sees without looking yet is named,
Accomplishes without doing.
The Way of the world is one—
The household and the world differ not.
Only cultivate the inner,
And the outer is known.
The Way of Heaven and the Way of Man unite—
Only cultivate the self,
And the Way of Heaven must respond.
What need is there for distant travel or peering through windows?
Thus the Sage does not seek outside,
Does not take from what is seen or heard,
Does not gain through speech or debate—
Spontaneously, all is accomplished.

**Chapter Forty-Nine**
For learning, daily increase;
For the Way, daily diminish.
Diminish again, diminish again,
Until reaching *wuwei*.
When there is *wuwei*, nothing is left undone.
To take the world with non-action,
Yet when action arises, it is insufficient to take the world.
To study extensively brings daily gain.
To cultivate virtue and power brings daily loss—
Meaning to diminish desires.
Until reaching the state of *wuwei* and non-action,
Then the hearts of the world are easily taken.

**Chapter Fifty**
The Sage has no fixed heart,
Taking the hearts of the people as heart.
The people have desires, the Sage acts with *wuwei*.
With a heart of *wuwei*, following the hearts of desire,
This is in accordance with nature.
The good, I treat well;
The unkind, I also treat well—thus I gain goodness.
The trustworthy, I trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—thus I gain trust.
The good, though good, I treat well—
The unkind, though unkind, I treat well—
Thus I attain the Way of goodness.
The trustworthy, I trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—
Thus I attain the principle of trust.

The Sage in the world is weary and diligent,
Blending his heart with the people’s.
The people all fix their ears and eyes upon him,
The Sage takes pity on them all.
The Sage, weary and diligent,
Merges his heart with the people’s—
The people gaze and await his favor,
The Sage takes pity on them all.

**Chapter Fifty-One**
Born, entering death,

「Cultivating the Dao brings forth life; indulging in desires leads to death.
Of those who seek life, there are thirteen types;
Of those who court death, there are thirteen types;
And among those who move between life and death, there are thirteen kinds of people.
Why is this so?
Because the pursuit of life is profound and thick.
In this world, birth and death are constants.
Even if death is three parts out of ten, there remains a path to life.
Even if life is three parts out of ten, it is still a path to death.
For though the desire for life is great, one cannot escape death and birth,
Thus, movement brings one into perilous deathly terrain.

It is heard that those who practice good *shèyǎng* (nurturing and cultivation) avoid death:
On land, they do not meet *xì* (rhinoceros) or *hǔ* (tigers),
In battle, they are not struck by armor or weaponry.
For those who harm others, the *xì* has horns, the *hǔ* has claws, and weapons have blades.
But if the *xì* finds no place to lodge its horn,
The *hǔ* finds no place to strike with its claw,
And weapons find no place to fit their blades—
Why is this so?
Because there is no deathly terrain.
On land, they know dawn and dusk;
In battle, they recognize advance and retreat.
Skilled in self-nurturance, adept at avoiding harm,
Thus, they have no deathly terrain.

**Chapter Fifty-Two**
The Dao is the origin of all things under heaven; it is the Mother of the world.
Having obtained its Mother, one knows its children—all things.
Having known its children, one must again guard its Mother, guard the Dao,
And thus, throughout life, one will not perish.
All things arise from the Dao, so it is their Mother.
The Mother must be known to understand its children,
The children must be known to understand the Mother.
Guarding the Mother and children in harmony,
One does not lose the Dao, and thus the body remains unharmed.
Seal its senses—close its eyes and ears—
And shut its gates and doors—
One will never labor throughout life.
Open its gates, aid its affairs,
And one will never be saved.
Those who guard the Dao do not prize speech or debate,
Nor do they gaze upon beauty or vice.
Those who defy it will find no end to their misfortunes,
Nor will their bodies escape toil and weariness.

Seeing the small as *míng* (clear/bright),
*Míng* perceives its subtleties.
Guarding softness as *qiáng* (strong),
Using its radiance—
The Dao returns to its *míng*,
Leaving no bodily calamity—
This is called *xié cháng* (following constancy).
For all things, from small to great,
Guarding softness as strength,
Action returns to the Dao,
Never losing its constancy—
Thus, there is no bodily harm.

**Chapter Fifty-Three**
If I were to be *jiè shàn* (distinctly virtuous) and yet have knowledge,
Walking the Great Dao,
I would fear only *shī* (giving/imposing).
If I were to know well,
There would be the Great Dao.
What I fear is that giving and imposing cannot be done as the common people would,
For knowing the Dao is easy, but walking it is difficult.

The Great Dao is most level,
Yet people prefer shortcuts.
The Great Dao is like a plain road,
But people do not like to walk it;
They all go down the crooked paths.

Morning is most *chú* (clear/empty),
Yet daily it is obscured by change—
Changing clothes, altering utensils and vessels,
Delighting in slaves, carriages, houses, and dwellings,
The fields are full of sprouts, yet the granaries remain empty—
The fields though planted, the granaries though full of crops, are still void,
Speaking of extravagant expenditure.
Clothing in fine colors and textures—
Wearing silk, brocade, cotton, and embroidered garments—
And adorning oneself with sharp blades—
Taking pleasure in bows and swords.

「To loathe food and drink,
One has no time to cook and butcher.

Wealth and goods are in excess,
Amassing treasures and riches—
Hoarding gold and jade.

This is called *dào kuà* (plundering/usurpation),
Is it not contrary to the Dao?

What one takes delight in thus,
Differs not from thieves and bandits.
Those who plunder are not virtuous.

**Chapter 54:**
*Good at establishing cannot be uprooted,*
Good at establishing matters—
They cannot be torn away.

*Good at embracing does not loosen,*
Good at embracing the Dao—
They cannot be shaken or abandoned.

Descendants sacrifice at the ancestral mounds without ceasing.
Those with virtue—
Their descendants, generation after generation, never cease in sacrifice.

Practice it upon oneself,
And its power becomes true;
True and unerring.

Practice it within the family,
And its power overflows;
Virtue and deeds abound.

Practice it in the village,
And its power endures;
Its influence is long-lasting.

Practice it in the state,
And its power flourishes—
All things prosper.

Practice it throughout the world,
And its power becomes universal.
Its virtue and blessings are far-reaching.

Therefore, observe oneself with the Dao,
To cultivate oneself brings fortune,
To neglect it brings misfortune.

Observe the family with the Dao,
To cultivate the family brings harmony,
To neglect it brings chaos.

Observe the village with the Dao,
To cultivate the village brings peace,
To neglect it brings strife.

Observe the state with the Dao.
To cultivate the state brings good governance,
To neglect it brings ruin.

Observe the world with the Dao.
To cultivate the world brings unity,
To neglect it brings fragmentation.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this—
The sage uses this Dao,
To observe the world.

**Chapter 55:**
*Discarding virtue’s depth,*
Comparable to an infant.

Poisonous insects do not sting,
Fierce birds and wild beasts do not attack.
*Plunderers* do not harm.

Deeply yielding, containing virtue—
Always like an infant,
With no scheming toward things,
Thus birds and beasts see them and do not harm.

*Attack* is akin to harm.

Bones weak, sinews soft yet grip firm—
An infant is soft and weak,
Though soft and weak, yet able to hold fast and solid,
For *primordial qi* is present.

Not knowing the union of *playing yin* (dark/soft principle),
Yet *jùn* (complete) in essence—
*Qi* is refined and solidified.

Crying all day yet voice does not scatter—
The utmost harmony.

*Playing yin*, the Dao of husband and wife.
What they do not yet know,
Then *zhēng* (pure) essence remains constant.
Crying yet not scattering—
Speaking of harmony in *qi* being achieved.

Knowing harmony is called *constancy*,
Nurturing life is called *deliberation*—
Carefully measuring essence and *qi*.
The heart directs *qi*—
Called *strengthening*.

Not directing it, it abides.
Things grow strong, then age—
Called *not the Dao*.
Not the Dao comes early.

Able to know harmony in *qi* always present,
Use the heart to deliberate carefully,
To make resources benefit the body as *strengthening* and clarity,
And long preserve softness and weakness—
Strongness is *not the Dao*.

**Chapter 56:**
*The wise do not speak,*
Those who speak are not wise.»

**Chapter 57:**
Seal its openings,
Close its gates,
Dull its sharpness,
Release its anger,
Blend its radiance,
Merge with the dust—
This is called *mysterious unity*.

Thus, it cannot be made close,
Cannot be made distant,
Cannot be made beneficial,
Cannot be made harmful,
Cannot be made noble,
Cannot be made lowly—
Therefore, it is held in highest esteem by the world.

The wise do not speak,
For they guard the Dao.
The unwise speak constantly,
Yet seek to enact their Dao.

The wise seal openings and close gates,
Dull sharpness and release anger,
Blend radiance and merge with dust—
Thus, they have no close or distant,
No benefit or harm,
No nobility or lowliness,
And align with the Dao in *mysterious virtue*,
Therefore attaining the world’s highest esteem.
The unwise do the opposite.

**Chapter 58:**
Govern the realm with *non-action*,
Conquer with *unexpectedness*,
Take the world with *inaction*.

How do I know the world is thus?
From this:
*Non-action* can govern the realm,
*Unexpectedness* can wage war.

In waging war, the general employs strange strategies,
Drives the enemy to death’s ground—
Do not show them pity or sincerity.
In governing the realm, to bring peace to the people,
Do not display cunning or deceit.
First remove your own calamities,
Then you may expand territory and open borders.

The Sage knows these two principles,
Thus governing is as it is.

The world abounds in taboos,
Yet people grow ever poorer;
Taboos multiply, rebellions arise—
Thus, laws are established.
Taboos do not follow desire,
Thus punishments are enforced.

People wield many sharp tools,
And the state grows ever more confused;
People use benefit and harm as tools—
This is the confusion of governance.

People abound in cleverness,
And strange things proliferate;
When cleverness and novelty flourish,
Strange things arise to deceive the masses.
Laws proliferate, yet thieves and robbers multiply.
Thieves and robbers rise in number,
Because they fear the laws and act accordingly.

Thus the Sage says:
I act with *non-action*, yet people transform themselves.
I impose no order, yet all is accomplished.
I take no action, yet people prosper—
Each follows their own desires.
I love stillness, yet people govern themselves—
No laws are set to oversee them.
I desire nothing, yet people return to simplicity.
No artificial teachings are established,
Yet none dare to presume knowledge.

The governance grows sluggish, and the people grow dull;
The governance becomes meticulous, and the people grow deficient.

When governance is sluggish, the people grow quiet and docile.
When governance is overzealous, the people grow mutilated and incomplete.

Calamity and fortune dwell as companions;
Fortune hides within calamity.
Who can truly know their limits?
People lean toward calamity, yet cultivate virtue to aid them.
Unknowing of fortune’s birth, they invite calamity instead.
Thus, when there is no governance,
The people lose their order.

When governance becomes contrived, virtue turns to idle talk.
The people’s confusion grows ever deeper.
Therefore, the Sage is square yet does not cut,
Sharp yet does not soil,
Straight yet does not overreach,
Bright yet does not dazzle.
When governance fails to harmonize,
Governance becomes deceitful trickery,
Virtue becomes chaotic confusion,
And the people’s bewilderment endures.
The Sage is square and round yet does not cut,
Prudent yet not impure,
Upright yet not aggressive,
Concealing brightness yet not blinding.

---

To govern people and serve Heaven,
Nothing surpasses adhering to the *Dao*.
Only by adhering does one lie low early.
To lie low early is to accumulate virtue deeply,
To accumulate virtue deeply is to be ever full,
To be ever full is to know no bounds.
To know the bounds is to govern a realm.
The mother of governing a realm is the *Dao*,
And it endures eternally.
Deep roots and firm foundations—
Plant its roots deep, lest they be uprooted.
The *Dao* of enduring life and long vision.

To govern human nature and follow Heaven’s timing,
Nothing surpasses adhering to laws and patterns,
Thus all things submit early.
After submission comes deep virtue accumulation,
Virtue accumulation fills all things,
No one knows their limits.
To know the limits is to govern a realm,
Then to become its mother.
Deep roots and firm foundations—
To preserve the state, vast and enduring.

---

To govern a great realm,
Treat it as you would a delicate dish—
A delicate dish requires careful handling.
When the *Dao* is applied to govern the world,
Its spirits are not feared.
Not that its spirits are not feared,
But that they do not harm people—
Not that they do not harm people,
But that the Sage does not harm people.
When neither harms the other,
Virtue returns in exchange.
The Sage above, and beasts and fish follow their nature—
How much more so the people?
When the *Dao* governs the world,
The seasons harmonize, and excess or harshness do not arise,
Thus the spirits cannot become malevolent.
All things have their spirits,
And when they become spirits, they harm people.
Only the true spirit does not harm,
The Sage embodies the *Dao* and does not harm,
Thus virtue returns in exchange.

---

Great realms are the confluence of the world,
The outskirts of the world,
The world’s outskirts are receptive—
Receptive, like the female.
The female is yielding, and yielding overcomes the male.
The male is strong, and strong is overcome by yielding.
Great realms, like rivers flowing downward,
All things gather there.
The world unifies, and the four quarters become its outskirts,
Ever victorious through yielding.
Thus, great realms submit to small realms and take them,
Small realms submit to great realms and gather under them.
Thus, some submit to take, others submit to gather.
Great realms desire only to nurture people,
Small realms desire only to serve them.
Both obtain what they desire—
Great realms desire to nurture, small realms desire to serve.
Thus, the great should submit.

Great realms treat small realms with propriety,
Small realms treat great realms with propriety.
Great realms desire to nurture people,
Small realms desire to serve them.
Though both have desires, the great should submit to take.

---

The *Dao* is the hidden essence of all things,
The treasure of the virtuous,
The refuge of the unvirtuous.
Its depth is unmatched.
The virtuous cherish it as their treasure,
The unvirtuous cannot preserve it.
Fine words can be sold,
Noble conduct can elevate one.
The skillful give and take.
Why abandon those who are unvirtuous?
Thus, the Son of Heaven is established,
And the Three Ministers are appointed.
The Son of Heaven governs the Three Ministers,
The Three Ministers govern the myriad offices,
The myriad offices govern the people—
Thus, no one is abandoned.
Though one may possess a jade tablet and four swift horses,
It is not as precious as yielding to this *Dao*.
The *Dao* and the four swift horses with jade tablet can both be used,
Yet only those who cultivate the *Dao* do not need to go themselves.
Anciently, why was this *Dao* so honored?
Was it not for seeking to obtain and avoiding guilt?
Thus, it is prized by the world.
The ancients said:
*"Do not needlessly walk the great *Dao*,
Yet benefit all—
Only avoid guilt and presumption,
And that is true nobility."*

---

To act without action is to act without contrivance,
To govern without governance is to labor without toil,
To savor without taste is to embrace simplicity.
Great and small, many and few—
Repay resentment with virtue.
The great and the small, the many and the few—
All are served by virtue, and none will harbor grudges.
Difficult things begin with ease,
Great things arise from the minute.
The world’s difficult tasks must begin with ease,
Great deeds must arise from the small.
Light promises bring few fulfillments,
Easy words lead to later failure.
Much ease brings much difficulty.
What seems simple in execution often fails in completion.
Thus, the Sage treats difficulty as difficulty,
And so never faces true difficulty.
Testing through all difficulties,
Then achieving success through virtue.

---

What is settled is easy to preserve.
What is not yet manifest is easy to plan.
What is woven is easy to unravel.
What is minute is easy to disperse.
Act before it exists,
Govern before it is disordered.
To govern disorder before it arises,
To act before it is complete—
To prepare for the unforeseen.
A tree thick as an embrace begins as a shoot;
A nine-tiered tower rises from a clod of earth;
A height of a hundred *ren* begins at one’s feet.
From the minute to the manifest,
From the small to the great.
Those who act destroy it,
Those who grasp lose it.

The Sage acts without action, hence no failure.
The Sage does not grasp, hence no loss.
Humans, in their undertakings, often succeed at the subtle and fail at the manifest.
To treat the end as carefully as the beginning—then there will be no failed undertakings.
The common people, clinging to desires, act and thus stray.
The Sage acts without action, seeing neither decline nor flourishing.
The common people cannot reverence the beginning nor carefully treat the end; as soon as they plan to act, they are already doomed to failure.
Thus, the Sage desires without desiring,
Does not prize difficult-to-obtain wealth;
Learns without learning,
Prepares for the faults of others,
And aids the natural unfolding of all things without daring to act.
To desire when one should not desire,
To learn when one should not learn,
To not value wealth and possessions,
To not covet fame and rank—
Thus, one prepares for the faults of others,
And aids the completion of all things,
Bringing them to their natural state—
This is the essence of the Sage.

**Chapter 65**
The ancients who were skilled in the Dao did not enlighten people,
But sought to delight and bring them joy.
The difficulty of governing people lies in their knowing,
For knowing creates distinctions.
To govern with wisdom is ruin for the state;
To govern without wisdom is to enrich the state’s virtue.
Knowing these two—governing with wisdom and without—
Is the standard and fixed law.
To always know the standard is called the profound virtue of governing the profound.
Deep and far-reaching virtue,
Opposing the ways of things,
Only then reaches the great harmony.
The ancients who governed did not force people to distinguish good and evil,
But only wished to make them joyful, without knowledge or awareness.
If they had knowledge, they would be difficult to govern.
Wisdom breeds deceit; deep cunning is a thief, the source of harm.
The profound virtue employs the standard,
Exhausting all circumstances,
Returning to great harmony.

**Chapter 66**
The reason the rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys
Is that they excel in humility,
Thus they become kings of all valleys.
Rivers and seas flow downward,
And all valleys return to them.
Thus, the Sage wishes to be above others by speaking humbly;
This is called compassionate concern.
The Sage wishes to lead others by placing himself last;
This is called aiding and guiding.
Thus, when in a high position, he does not burden others with heavy demands;
When in the forefront, he does not harm others.
Therefore, all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion.
Because he does not contend,
None under heaven can contend with him.
The Sage in office has a mind to serve below and honor above,
In the forefront has the virtue of placing others first and himself last—
None grow weary of him,
And all willingly follow daily—
Who could contend with him?

**Chapter 67**
All under heaven consider me great, yet I do not laugh.
Only because I am great do I seem not to laugh.
If I laughed for long, I would be small.
The Dao is the greatest under heaven,
Thus it cannot be laughed at or compared.
Because it is great, it is not laughed at or compared.
If one laughs at or compares it for long,
Then it is indeed small.
I have three treasures, which I hold fast:
The first is compassion,
The second is frugality,
The third is not daring to be first under heaven.
With compassion, frugality, and not being first as my three treasures,
The Sage holds them as precious.
Compassion makes one courageous—
Compassion saves all things, hence courage arises.
Frugality makes one abundant—
Frugality moderates use, hence abundance arises.
Not daring to be first makes one a vessel and leader—
Not being first is humility, hence one attains leadership.
Now, to abandon compassion and courage,
To abandon frugality and abundance,
To abandon placing others last and oneself first—
This is the path to death.
Now, to be courageous without compassion,
Abundant without frugality,
First without placing others last—
This is the path to death.
Compassion, when arraying troops, brings order;
When defending, it secures cities.
Heaven, about to save them, guards with compassion.
Troops arrayed with compassion do not kill;
Cities defended with compassion are not harmed.
In accordance with Heaven and the people,
There is natural salvation and protection.

**Chapter 68**
The ancients skilled in being a scholar did not rely on martial strength,
But established the Way of governance.
Skilled warriors do not rage nor glorify slaughter.
Skilled in defeating enemies, they do not contend;
Their formations are without battle.
Skilled in using people, they place themselves below.
When two armies meet, ritual stands between them.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
This is called the strength of using people,
This is called aligning with Heaven—
The ancient ultimate.
Martial strength is used to settle difficulties;
Skilled rulers have no difficulties,
Thus they do not glorify martial strength.
If matters cannot be resolved by oneself and arms are used,
One does not rage at the enemy,
Does not contend with the foe,
But submits with ritual,
Seeking victory without aggression—
This is the ancient ultimate law.

**Chapter 69**
There are words about using arms.
The ancients said:
I do not dare to seek to be the aggressor, the first to bring calamity,
But to be the responder.
I do not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.
I have no intent to seize.
This is called having no course of action,
Yet having orders.
To sweep away without arms,
Yet having what is to be gathered.
To grasp without weapons,
Yet having weapons without using them.
To have no enemy.
By law, how can there be an enemy?
The greatest calamity is to insult the enemy—
This is lightness in facing the enemy.
To insult the enemy risks losing one’s treasure—
One’s own troops.
Thus, when opposing forces clash,
The compassionate prevail over the cruel.
Though skilled in war and facing no equal,
If one is lighthearted toward the enemy, one will lose oneself.
When two armies clash,
The yielding overcomes the strong.

**Chapter 70**
My words are very easy to know,
Very easy to practice.
Without selfishness, there is no difficulty.
Yet none under heaven can know or practice them—
They are profound and subtle.
Words have their origin,
Affairs have their master.
Speaking follows the origin,
Acting follows the master.
Only because of their lack of knowing,
None know me.
The world has what it does not know,
And the Sage cannot know it either.
Few know me,
Thus I am precious.
Few know the Dao,
Thus the Dao is precious.
Therefore, the Sage wears coarse cloth while cherishing the Dao.

「Obtaining the Dao/Way is indeed so.
To not know what one knows is a sickness.
Forcefully discard understanding and insight.
The Sage does not fall ill,
For there is no thought or concern.
Because of their sickness of knowing,
They do not fall ill.
Their sickness lies in what they know,
Thus they attain no sickness.

**Chapter 72**
If people do not fear great threats,
Then great threats will come upon them.
Move with caution in all undertakings,
And there will be no great mistakes.
Do not restrict your dwelling,
Nor harbor resentment and sorrow.
Always maintain moderation in taking.
Do not exhaust what you are given.
Life’s span is limited—
Why press and force it?
Only because one does not exhaust,
Does one not exhaust.
Thus one may attain longevity.
Therefore, the Sage knows himself but does not reveal himself,
Loves himself but does not exalt himself.
He does not seek fame or recognition—
Self-knowledge is his own worth.
He does not covet glory and splendor—
Self-nobility is his own honor.
Discard that, embrace this.
Discard that and life will perish,
Embrace this and the Dao/Way will be gained.

**Chapter 73**
Brave but daring leads to death,
Cowardly retreat brings survival.
Brave but not daring leads to life.
Carefully measure what is fitting.
These two paths—
One may benefit, one may harm.
What Heaven abhors,
Who knows its reason?
People do not know Heaven’s Dao/Way:
The noble hold no desires,
Avoiding benefit and harm.
Heaven’s Dao/Way:
Does not contend yet prevails,
Does not speak yet responds well,
Does not summon yet comes of its own accord,
Does not command yet plans are fulfilled.
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
Though sparse, it does not lose its prey.
Heaven’s Dao/Way is ever robust,
Thus it overcomes itself and responds,
Comes and plans on its own.
Though myriad things exist,
Bound by Heaven’s Dao/Way—
Where else could they go?
Thus there is no oversight or loss.

**Chapter 74**」

**Chapter 75**
People do not commonly fear death—
Why then use death to frighten them?
Few in the world escape harm unscathed.
Many indulge in greed and excess,
Unafraid of law and punishment—
This is because they do not fear death.

If people did not fear death,
And yet were to act strangely,
I would test them and kill them.
If people do not fear death,
And yet the world has those who act strangely—
How could I kill them in turn?
Who would dare?

Who would dare kill one who knows death?
Those who execute kill.
Those who wield the law—
To act as the executioner’s substitute
Is to act as the master carpenter’s axe.
Those who wield the law wield power.
To act as the master carpenter’s axe,
Few escape unharmed.
Even the master carpenter sometimes injures his hand—
Sometimes lightly, sometimes gravely.

**Chapter 76**
People starve because their rulers tax them heavily.
Heavy taxation is the cause.
People are hard to govern because their rulers act excessively.
Harsh laws oppress them.
People grow indifferent to death because life is made too luxurious.
They indulge in tastes and hoard jewels and gold.
Only those who do not cling to life are truly noble in valuing it.
Those who seek life excessively perish.
Those who seek life sparingly live.

**Chapter 77**
When alive, humans are soft and weak;
When dead, they are stiff and strong.
While spirit and soul remain, they are soft and weak;
When scattered, they become stiff and strong.
All things—grasses and trees—
While living, are soft and yielding.
While dying, they wither and decay.
Qi preserved, they are soft and weak;
Qi exhausted, they wither and decay.
Thus, the stiff and strong belong to death,
The soft and weak belong to life.
Therefore, strong armies do not conquer,
Strong trees split.
Armies must harmonize with the people,
Trees must be of moderate strength.
Thus, the strong and mighty are beneath,
The soft and weak are above.
Branches and twigs are above,
Roots and trunks are below.
Soldiers are in the front,
Commanders are behind.

**Chapter 78**
The Dao/Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow:
The high are lowered, the low are raised,
The excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.
The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.
But human affairs are not so:
They diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.
Heaven values harmony and compliance,
A bow values balance and uniformity—
No bias toward large or small,
No disparity between high and low.
By this, the world is governed—
This is called *Great Peace*.
Human affairs are not so:
They honor the strong and suppress the weak,
Favor the few and serve the many—
This is called *seizing power*.
Who can serve the world with what they have in excess?
Only the Daoist.

Divide what is above to aid what is lacking.
Thus, the Sage acts without claiming credit,
Achieves without dwelling on success—
This is why they are not esteemed.
The Sage pushes merit forward and declines rewards,
Extending virtue to the worthy and the good.

**Chapter 79**
Nothing in the world is as soft and weak as water,
Yet nothing surpasses it in attacking the firm and strong.
It cannot be replaced.
Water can temper steel—
It cannot be altered.
Thus, the soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong.
Few in the world know this,
Fewer still can practice it.
Yin consumes Yang,
The soft overcomes the strong—
Few in the world know this,
Fewer still can practice it.

To bear a nation’s impurities—
This is called the *Lord of the Soil*.
To bear a nation’s misfortunes—
This is called the *King of the World*.
Straight speech seems contrary.
When a nation faces hardship, the feudal lords bear it.
When the world faces calamity, only the King governs it.
This is called the *Dao/Way of governance*.

「To reconcile great grudges, there must be lingering grudges—
How can this be considered good?
If there are grudges and hatred first, then only later can they be settled—
This is still insufficient to be called good.
Thus, the Sage holds only the *left contract* (契), not the *right* (符),
Demanding nothing of others,
So the virtuous govern contracts (契),
The unvirtuous govern tracks (辙).
The virtuous in all things align with others in harmony (符契),
Demanding nothing of others.
The unvirtuous always seek to force others into conformity (合辙),
Thus incurring grudges and enmity (怨雠).
Tracks (辙) are like footprints (迹).
The Dao/Way of Heaven has no favorites,
Always aligning with those who speak in the *departing voice* (去声) of goodness.
The Dao/Way of Heaven has no partiality or distance,
Always aligning with the virtuous in shared power (合德).

**Chapter 80**
In small states with few people,
There are countless skilled and intelligent individuals yet unused, untrusted—
They cause others to hold death in reverence and not depart.
In small states, the great Dao/Way of governance is not employed,
Yet those with talent and cunning are entrusted,
Enforcing harsh laws and restraining the people,
Forcing them to risk death and flee to distant lands.
The Sage, wishing to enact the great Dao/Way,
Does not rely on talent and cunning,
But makes others hold death in reverence and not go.
Depart (徙) is to move (移).
Though there are boats and carriages,
There is no place to embark;
No labor of movement.
Though there are arms and armor,
There is no place to array them;
No warfare.
They return to using knotted cords (结绳),
Reverting to simplicity (还淳).
Sweet their food, fine their clothing—
No hunger, no cold.
Secure their dwellings, content their customs—
Families well-provided, people at ease,
No levies or forced labor.
Neighboring states are visible to one another,
Four borders unassailed.
Cock’s crow and dog’s bark are heard between them,
Neighbors dwell in close proximity.»

The Sage lets people live out their days to old age,
Without ever visiting one another.
He makes each person self-sufficient for life,
So that at death, no borrowing or lending remains.

**Chapter Eighty-One**
True words are not ornate;
Ornate words are not true.
They reveal sincerity plainly.

The wise do not amass knowledge;
Those who amass knowledge are not wise.
No need for inquiry.

The virtuous do not argue;
Those who argue are not virtuous.
No need for embellishment.

The Sage does not hoard music;
When exhausted, he gives it to others—
The more he gives, the greater his own abundance.
The more he possesses, the more he shares—
The more he shares, the more he has.

The Dao/Way of Heaven profits without harming;
The Dao/Way of the Sage acts without striving.

The Sage does not accumulate;
The Sage serves others—
Others serve the Sage—
The Sage shares with others—
Others share with the Sage—
Thus, the more they turn, the more they possess.

The Dao/Way of Heaven profits without harming;
The Dao/Way of the Sage holds virtue/power without striving.
