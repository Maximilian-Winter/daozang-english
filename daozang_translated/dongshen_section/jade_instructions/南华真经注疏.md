**Inner Chapters – "Free and Easy Wandering" (First)**

**[Commentary]**
Though small and great differ, when released into the realm of self-attainment, things follow their nature, affairs match their capacities, and each abides in its proper measure—free and easy wandering is one. How could victory or defeat arise between them?

**In the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun.**
The greatness of Kun—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans.

**[Subcommentary]**
"Darkness" (*ming*) is like "sea," taken for its vast and boundless obscurity, hence called "darkness." Dongfang Shuo’s *Record of the Ten Continents* states: "The Dark Sea has no wind, yet its waves rise a hundred *zhang*." Within this immense sea dwells this great fish, intended to illustrate the spontaneity of things’ natures, thus placed at the chapter’s head. The *Mysteries Within Records* says: "In the east there is a great fish; a traveler takes a day to pass its head, seven days to pass its tail. When it spawns for three days, the azure sea turns red." Thus we know great things arise in great places—why only the Northern Darkness? It transforms into a bird, its name is Peng.

**[Commentary]**
The reality of Peng and Kun, I have not yet fathomed. Master Zhuang’s grand intent lies in free and easy wandering, non-action and self-attainment. Thus he exhausts the extremes of small and great to clarify the suitability of inherent nature. Those of far-reaching vision should grasp its convergence and let go of its lodging—there is no need to quibble over every detail with the living. As long as it does not harm the great purport, all may be passed over.

**[Subcommentary]**
The four seasons race like wind, the three luminaries course like lightning—thus one may bear mountains and cast off the old, or hoist valleys and hasten toward the new. Therefore, the transformation of fish into bird serves to illuminate the grand principle of change. The Peng’s back—who knows how many thousand *li* it spans? Roused to flight, its wings hang like clouds suspended from the sky.

**[Subcommentary]**
The fish is described in terms of its vastness to show how its head and tail defy comprehension; the bird is spoken of in terms of its back to suggest that its length is beyond measure. Thus the text below states, “None have known its full extent.” Beating its wings in fury, its feathers bristle with vigor—now it seeks to strike the wind, now it prepares to cleave the water. Then it severs the clouds; its back bears the azure sky. Soaring and wheeling, it grazes the thunder and the Milky Way, riding the yin to cast its shadow, like a cloud descending from the edge of heaven.

This bird, when the sea stirs, will migrate to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond.

**[Commentary]**
No mere dark sea could bear its body; no less than ninety thousand *li* could support its wings. Is this mere love of the marvelous? It is simply that great things must arise in great places, and great places must give rise to such great things—this is the inherent pattern of nature, free from error. Why trouble the mind over such matters?

**[Subcommentary]**
*Yun* means “to turn.” *Shi* refers to this Peng-bird. Its form is so massive that without the sea’s turning motion, it could not ascend—all this is inevitable, not a matter of preference. Moreover, as its form undergoes transformation, so too does its nature. Once a fish, it swam in the Northern Sea; now a bird, it soars toward the Southern Darkness. Though its rise and fall differ in kind, its ease is one. This is like life and death, gathering and dispersal—whatever it encounters is fitting. Through ten thousand transformations, it has never ceased to be itself.

The reason for the fish’s transformation into a bird, moving from north to south, lies in this: the bird is a creature of the void, and the south is the direction of the Morning Star; the fish is a creature of stagnation, and the north holds the land of deep obscurity. The intent is to show the turning toward light and away from darkness, the casting off of stagnation in pursuit of progress. Thus the fish and bird of north and south are presented as the path of the Way.

The great sea and vast rivers originate from the workings of creation, not from human hands—hence it is called the Celestial Pond.

*The Record of Qi Xie* is a chronicle of marvels. It states: When the Peng migrates to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, then beats against the whirlwind to ascend ninety thousand *li*.

**[Commentary]**
With wings so vast, it cannot take flight easily—only by striking the whirlwind can it rise, and only at ninety thousand *li* can it fully sustain itself. Given such wings, how could it rise sluggishly, only to descend after a few *ren*? All this is inevitable, not a matter of preference.

It departs with the winds of the sixth month.

**[Commentary]**
The great bird departs for half a year before resting at the Celestial Pond; the small bird flies for half a morning before alighting on the elm or sandalwood. Though their capacities differ, their fulfillment of nature is one.

**[Subcommentary]**
Qi Xie is the name of a person. It may also refer to the title of a book—there exists in the state of Qi a record called *Xie* that chronicles strange events. *Ji* means “to strike,” *bo* means “to contend,” and *fuyao* is a whirlwind. The book compiled by Qi Xie records many marvels, and Master Zhuang cites it as evidence to confirm that his account is not baseless.

When the great Peng sets out for the Southern Darkness, it cannot rise sluggishly. Thus it strikes its wings, stirring three thousand *li* of water, and travels along the surface before it can leave the sea. Then, spiraling and circling, it beats its wings in fury, riding the wind’s force to ascend. After traversing ninety thousand *li* and half a year’s time, it arrives at last, its ambition fulfilled, and speaks of resting. It seeks only what suffices—how could it be a matter of preference?

The wild horses, the dust motes—all living things are blown aloft by one another’s breath.

**[Commentary]**
These are what the Peng relies upon to fly. The “wild horses” are wandering *qi*.

**[Subcommentary]**
The *Erya* states: “Beyond the city is the outskirts, beyond the outskirts is the pasture, beyond the pasture is the wilds.” Here, it refers to the time of spring, when the yang *qi* stirs. Gazing into the marshes, one sees *qi* like galloping horses—hence the term “wild horses.” Dust is raised earth; the finest dust is called motes. Between heaven and earth, the breath of living things blows one another aloft, enabling the Peng’s flight.

The four kinds of life, the ten thousand forms—all differ in shape and nature, each requiring different supports. Thus the Peng beats its wings that span the sky, riding the wind in ease; the cicada and fledgling dove stretch their small wings, alighting on the elm or sandalwood in contentment. All act in accord with their nature, receiving it from creation. They harbor no preference for far or near, nor do they concern themselves with pride or humility. Those who embody this spirit—why should they speak of longing or aspiration?

Is the deep blue of heaven its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no end? When the Peng looks down, it sees only as we do.

**[Commentary]**
Gazing at the deep blue of heaven, we cannot know whether it is truly heaven’s color or merely its boundless distance. When the Peng looks down from above, it is as when we look up from below. Thus it halts and plans its journey south.

**[Subcommentary]**
Looking up at the vault of heaven, it seems immeasurably distant. The azure expanse stretches endlessly—is this truly heaven’s color? Yet when the Peng soars in the middle reaches, its view of the earth below is no different from our view of heaven above. Just as we cannot discern heaven’s true color, the Peng cannot know the earth’s distance. It seeks only what suffices to sustain itself and flies toward the Southern Darkness. The Peng’s calculations end here.

Moreover, when water does not accumulate to sufficient depth, it lacks the power to bear a great boat. Pour a cup of water onto a hollow in the hall, and a mustard seed may serve as a boat; but place the cup there, and it will stick fast—water is shallow, and the boat too large.

**[Commentary]**
All this illustrates why the Peng soars so high: its wings are vast. What is small in substance requires no great support, so what is great in substance cannot be sustained by what is small. Thus, principle has its ultimate measure, things have their fixed limits, and each suffices for its task—all achieve their end alike. If one loses the master of forgetting life and pursues it beyond what is fitting, if one’s affairs exceed one’s strength and one’s movements do not match one’s nature, then even riding the wings of heaven, one cannot escape exhaustion, and the flight of lesser creatures cannot avoid distress.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Moreover* is a provisional term, a phrase of passing mention. *Coupled with* marks the beginning, the start of an argument. *Accumulate* means to gather; *depth* means profound. A *cup* is a small vessel. *Hollow* refers to a sunken or depressed place in the hall’s floor. *Mustard seed* is a grass. *Stick fast* means to adhere. This begins the analogy.

If one overturns a cup of water into a hollow in the hall’s floor, a mustard leaf may float upon it without hindrance; but if one uses the cup itself as a boat, it will not move. Why? The water is shallow and the boat too large, so it clings to the earth and does not advance. Thus, a great boat requires deep water, while a tiny mustard seed needs no mighty current—if size and circumstance are fitting, all things wander freely.

When wind does not accumulate to sufficient depth, it lacks the power to bear great wings. Thus, at ninety thousand *li*, the wind lies beneath it.

**[Subcommentary]**
This completes the analogy. If water is not deep, a great boat cannot float; if wind is not lofty, great wings cannot ascend the heavens. Thus, the small bird flies for half a morning, darting among the mulberry and elm; the great Peng, at ninety thousand *li*, is borne aloft by the whirling wind beneath it. Only then does it ride the wind; only with the blue sky at its back and no obstacle to block its way does it then set its course southward.

**[Commentary]**
That it now sets its course southward is not because it delights in height or yearns for distance, but because without accumulated wind, the path is not open. This is the Peng’s wandering.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Ride* means to rely upon. *Obstacle* means to block; *path* means to obstruct. At first, it depends on the whirlwind to ascend; only with wind amassed beneath it can it take flight. Then, with the sky above and the wind’s spine below, it soars through the heavens, journeying for six months before it rests. Nets and snares cannot reach it, arrows and traps do not touch it—where could misfortune of blockage or ruin befall it? Truly, with resources and needs in harmony, it attains its rightful place, wandering to the Southern Sea—is this not fitting?

The cicada and the turtledove laugh at it, saying: “We dart up and fly, striking the mulberry and sandalwood; sometimes we do not reach our goal and fall to the earth—what need is there to travel ninety thousand *li* to the south?”

**[Commentary]**
If one is content with one’s nature, then even the great Peng has no cause to value itself above the small bird, nor does the small bird envy the heavenly pond—its joy and fulfillment are complete. Thus, though great and small differ, their wandering is one.

**[Subcommentary]**
The *cicada* is an insect that emerges in the seventh or eighth month, purple-green in color, also called *zhaoliao*. The *turtledove* is the magpie dove, the same as today’s spotted dove. *Dart* describes swift movement. *Strike* means to alight or dart. *Sandalwood* is a type of hardwood. *Fall* means to descend, to draw near, or to reach an end. *What need* asks why. *Travel* means to go.

The cicada and turtledove, hearing of the Peng’s vastness and how it relies on wind and water to fly so high, mock its great size and toil, delighting in their own smallness and ease. They leap no higher than a few yards, darting among the mulberry and sandalwood; when weary, they do not reach the next grove but rest upon the earth before rising again. Wandering as their nature suits them, they find joy in this—why endure a six-month journey, ninety thousand *li* of arduous travel, to reach the south? Those who, in their smallness, laugh at what is great, who boast and strive yet do not wander freely—such have never been.

Those who travel to the misty wilds take three meals and return with bellies still full; those who journey a hundred *li* spend the night grinding grain; those who go a thousand *li* gather provisions for three months.

**[Commentary]**
The farther one travels, the more provisions one must gather. Thus, the greater the wings, the thicker the accumulated *qi*.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Travel* means to go. *Misty wilds* describes the color of the countryside, hazy and indistinct from afar. *Full* describes a sated belly. Going to the countryside, one returns after three meals, the journey being short, the belly still full. A journey of a hundred *li* is somewhat farther, so one grinds grain to prepare for an overnight stay. Traveling a thousand *li*, the road is long, so one gathers three months’ provisions to suffice for the journey. As Guo’s commentary says: “The farther one travels, the more provisions one must gather; thus, the greater the wings, the thicker the accumulated *qi*.”

What do these two creatures know?

**[Commentary]**
The two creatures are the Peng and the cicada. The great is set against the small to show that their aims are equal. Why are their aims different? Is it because they knowingly choose difference? All simply follow what they do not know and act naturally. Acting naturally means not acting at all—this is the great meaning of wandering.

**[Subcommentary]**
Guo’s commentary says: “The two creatures are the Peng and the cicada; the great is set against the small to show that their aims are equal.” Though the great Peng rides the wind for ninety thousand *li* and the small bird darts among the mulberry and sandalwood, though their distances differ, each follows its nature. Neither knows the length of its journey; each takes what suffices and sustains itself. The heavenly mechanism unfolds of itself—none know how.

Since there is no intent toward high or low, how could there be feeling for superiority or inferiority? The attainment of wandering lies precisely here.

As for calling the Peng a "creature," the *Greater Dai Ritual* states: "In the east are three hundred sixty scaled creatures, with the winged dragon as their chief; in the south are three hundred sixty feathered creatures, with the phoenix as their chief; in the west are three hundred sixty furred creatures, with the qilin as their chief; in the north are three hundred sixty shelled creatures, with the spirit turtle as their chief; in the center are three hundred sixty naked creatures, with the sage as their chief." Speaking broadly, the Peng is thus called a creature.

Lesser knowledge does not reach greater knowledge; shorter years do not reach longer years.

**[Commentary]**
Each thing has its nature, and each nature has its limit—all are like years and knowledge. How could they be within the reach of aspiration? From this point through the passage on Liezi, examples of long and short years and knowledge are cited, each trusting in its own measure, none sufficient to overturn another. Only then is the person without dependence brought forth—who forgets others and forgets self, obscures these manifold differences, and while all attain their own Way, remains without merit or fame. Thus, one who unites small and great is one without small or great; if there were small and great, then even the great Peng and the marsh wren, the minister and the wind-rider, would alike be burdened by things. One who equalizes life and death is one without life or death; if there were life and death, then even the great *zhuang* tree and the mayfly, Pengzu and the morning mushroom, would be equally cut short. Therefore, advancing to the state without small or great is to be without limit; obscuring the distinction between non-life and non-death is to be without end. If wandering is bound to a particular realm, then even if released to roam, it will have its limit and remain dependent.

**[Subcommentary]**
Things receive qi differently and are endowed with distinct portions: some knowledge is bright, some dim; some years are short, some long. Thus, the morning mushroom, the *mingling* tree, the minister, and Rongzi are all like years and knowledge—how could they be within the reach of aspiration? Therefore, the natures of things differ and cannot be forcibly imitated.

How do we know this is so?

**[Subcommentary]**
*Xi* means "what"; *ran* means "thus." How do we know that years and knowledge do not reach one another to such an extreme degree? The question is posed hypothetically, and the answer follows.

The morning mushroom does not know the dark and the dawn; the mayfly does not know spring and autumn—these are short years.

**[Subcommentary]**
This answers the previous question. The morning mushroom grows when rain lingers, steaming upon dung and soil; it lives in damp shade and dies when exposed to sunlight. It is also called "dog fungus," born at dawn and dead by dusk, hence the name "morning mushroom." The last day of the month is called *hui* (dark); the first day is called *shuo* (dawn). If it encounters shade, it withers in days and never spans a full month, thus it does not know the dark and the dawn. The mayfly is the summer cicada, born on wheat stalks (also called "wheat joints"), living in summer and dying in autumn, thus it does not know spring and autumn. The mushroom lives from dawn to dusk; the cicada grows in summer and perishes in autumn—both have brief lifespans, hence they are called "short years."

South of Chu there is the *mingling* tree, which takes five hundred years as its spring and five hundred years as its autumn. In high antiquity there was the great *zhuang* tree, which takes eight thousand years as its spring and eight thousand years as its autumn.

**[Subcommentary]**
Both the *mingling* and the *zhuang* are names of trees, with leafing as spring and shedding as autumn. The *mingling* grows south of Chu, taking two thousand years as one year. "High antiquity" refers to the time of Fuxi. The great *zhuang* tree grew in high antiquity, taking thirty-two thousand years as one year. The *mingling* blooms after five hundred years; the *zhuang* sheds leaves after eight thousand years—both have prolonged springs and autumns, hence they are called "long years."

Yet Pengzu alone is renowned for his longevity today. For the common people to compare themselves to him is truly lamentable.

**[Commentary]**
The disparity in years and knowledge is so vast that to compare oneself to the masses is also lamentable. Yet the masses do not lament this because each nature has its limit. If one knows this limit, then even the slightest difference cannot be surpassed—what in the world is there to lament? Things never desire to be small because of greatness, nor do they envy greatness because of smallness. Since the distinction between small and great is fixed by nature and not within the reach of envy or desire, the burden of envy and desire can be severed. Sorrow arises from burden; when burden is severed, sorrow departs. When sorrow departs and nature and life are not at peace, such a thing has never existed.

**[Subcommentary]**
Pengzu’s surname was Qian, his given name Keng, and he was a great-grandson of Emperor Zhuanxu. Skilled in nurturing his nature and regulating the cauldron, he presented pheasant soup to Yao, who enfeoffed him at Pengcheng. His Way was worthy of being an ancestor, hence he was called Pengzu. He lived through the Xia and Shang dynasties into the Zhou, reaching eight hundred years of age. *Te* means "alone"—his long life made his name uniquely renowned. Yet for common people to compare themselves to Pengzu is deeply sorrowful. They do not grieve because Pengzu’s nature was endowed with long life, unlike their own kind, so they set it beyond words and dare not sigh in sorrow. Thus, life has its limits. Not only is Pengzu’s longevity beyond reach by even the slightest measure, but in this, the *zhuang* tree and the mushroom, Pengzu and the ephemeral, are all equal—each abides in its portion, and nature and life are at peace.

Tang’s question to Ji is also like this.

**[Commentary]**
Tang’s question to Ji likewise states that each thing has its limit; when left to itself, it flourishes. Thus, Zhuangzi regarded the question as correct.

**[Subcommentary]**
Tang was a descendant of Di Ku and a scion of Xie, with the surname Zi, the given name Lü, and the courtesy name Tianyi. His mother, Fudu, saw a white vapor piercing the moon and conceived Tang. His appearance was full below and open above, and he stood nine feet tall.

In Xia, he served as a feudal lord, possessing sagely virtue, and the lords submitted to him. When he encountered Jie’s lawlessness, he was imprisoned in the Summer Terrace. Later released, he joined the feudal lords in an alliance at Jingbo, convened with Jie at the ruins of Kunwu, and fought a great battle on the plains of Mingtiao, where Jie fled to Nanchao. After Tang overthrew Jie, he offered the realm to Wu Guang, who refused. Tang then ascended the throne, establishing his capital at Bo, later renamed Shang—the founding sovereign of Yin.

Ji was a worthy of Tang’s time, also called Tang’s erudite. *Liezi* refers to him as Xia Ge; "Ge" and "Ji" are phonetically similar, likely a scribal error. As Ji was a worthy, Tang treated him as a teacher. Thus, Tang questioned Ji about the supreme Dao, inquiring into the nature of things: though their natures differ, each has its inherent portion. Following their natural course and abiding in spontaneity, one lets them be. Tang’s earnest inquiry delved deeply into profound subtleties, and Zhuangzi affirmed its correctness, hence saying it was so.

Beyond the barren north lies the Dark Sea, a celestial lake. There dwells a fish, its width spanning thousands of *li*, its length unknown—its name is Kun.

**[Subcommentary]**
"Length" here means extent. The earth’s vegetation is likened to hair; the northernmost lands, frozen and desolate, bear no grass or trees, hence called "barren." The Kun fish spans thousands in width, its length unmeasured—thus its vastness is evident. Yet the Kun and Peng were already described earlier. Their reappearance here serves to confirm: the prior citation of *Qi Xie* established authority, while this reference to *Liezi* further verifies its truth, reinforcing the point with meticulous care.

There is also a bird, named Peng, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky. It beats the whirling winds, ascending ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds, bearing the blue heavens, then turning southward.

**[Subcommentary]**
The Peng’s back is vast as the sacred peaks; its spiraling winds twist like ram’s horns. Soaring to the azure vault, it cleaves the clouds, its mighty wings driving it toward the southern sea. Thus, in *Yu Tang’s Questions*, Liezi remarks: "Who in the world knows of such a creature?" Yu the Great saw it, Bo Yi named it, and Yi Jian recorded it.

Yet it merely heads south to the Dark Sea. The quail laughs at it, saying: "Where does it think it’s going? I leap and flutter, rising no more than a few yards before descending, wheeling among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the utmost of flight! Where does *it* think it’s going?" This is the distinction between small and great.

**[Commentary]**
Each attains perfection by fulfilling its nature, and the utmost by exhausting its own capacity. Earlier, it was said that the two creatures differ in wings, hence their destinations diverge—one soars over the celestial pond, the other fulfills its aspirations among the elm and sandalwood. Each is content with its form and sufficient unto itself, unaware of why it is so. Now, the distinction between small and great is spoken of again: each possesses its natural endowment, neither attainable through striving nor envied for its difference. Thus, all rest in their inherent nature, untroubled by disparity, and so the passage is reiterated.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Qie* means "then," or serves as a grammatical particle. *Chi* is a small marsh. *Zhe* is the sparrow. Eight *chi* make one *ren*. *Aoxiang* means "to frolic." The crane and sparrow, small birds, roam freely in the marsh, leaping and bounding within the mugwort and wormwood, deriding the journey of ninety thousand *li* and delighting in their flight of a few *ren*. This illustrates the distinction between the natures of small and great, and the principle that each is sufficient in its own way. Thus, those who "use their knowledge to serve in one office, compare their conduct to one village, align their virtue with one ruler, or win the trust of one state"—their self-regard is no different.

**[Commentary]**
This is like the bird content within its own domain.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Gu* connects to the preceding passage, while *fu* introduces what follows. A *guo* is one of the five ranks of states; a *xiang* comprises twelve thousand five hundred households. Some possess the wisdom and skill to govern an office; some have renowned reputations, esteemed throughout their village; some embody vast virtue, fit to face south as a ruler, pacifying a state and securing its people. These three differ in their allotted roles and vary in excellence, yet in their sufficiency, they are not unequal. Their self-assessment is like the bird content within its own domain. Yet Song Rongzi still laughs at them.

**[Commentary]**
Unable to equalize, he thus laughs.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Zi* is an honorific for one of virtue; his surname is Rong, and he is from Song. *Youran* means "thus." Though Rongzi can forget being, he cannot yet relinquish non-being, hence his laughter. Those bound to office and rank, and even those of empty indifference, harbor such derision, for they perceive the lack of equality. Earlier, the small mocked the great to show that the great do not boast; now, the great mocks the small, so the small do not aspire. Those who do not rest in their nature and destiny have not yet heard this principle. "When the whole world praises him, he is not spurred; when the whole world condemns him, he is not disheartened."

**[Commentary]**
He examines and attains self-sufficiency.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Ju* means "all." *Quan* means "to encourage." *Ju* means "to grieve or despair." Rongzi follows his nature and embraces the Dao, transcending the common with clarity. Were the world to praise him, he would not be stirred to greater effort; were all the land to slander him, he would not be cast into despair—he examines and attains self-sufficiency. "He is certain of the division between inner and outer."

**[Commentary]**
Inner is the self; outer is things.

**[Subcommentary]**
Rongzi knows that what is within is not the self, and what is without is not things. He relinquishes both inner and outer, forgetting both self and things, thus he is certain of the division between inner and outer without confusion. "He distinguishes the realm of honor and disgrace."

**[Commentary]**
Honor is for oneself; disgrace is for others.

**[Subcommentary]**
He forgets encouragement and discouragement in praise and blame, merging success and failure in honor and disgrace. Thus, he reflects inwardly with clarity of mind, discerning the subtleties of the external realm with profound insight. No longer does he regard inner as self and outer as things, nor honor himself and disgrace others. "This is the limit."

**[Commentary]**
He cannot surpass this.

**[Subcommentary]**
"斯" means "this"; "已" means "to cease." Does Song Rong’s wisdom and virtue cease at this point? Yet in his engagement with the world, he is not restless.

**[Commentary]**
Content with himself, he is thus indifferent to the world.

**[Subcommentary]**
"数数" means "eagerly striving." Song Rong, following his nature, remains empty and tranquil, advancing straightforwardly with the principle, never employing his intellect to seek or his mind to pursue the Dao. Dwelling beyond the self and things, he is not restless. Nevertheless, there is still something he has not established.

**[Commentary]**
He can only affirm himself; he has not yet reached the state of "nothing is not permissible."

**[Subcommentary]**
"树" means "to establish." Rongzi grasps the manifest to verify the hidden, yet remains mired in partiality and stagnation. Thus, in the mind of non-dependence, he has not established the realm of carefree wandering, and his wisdom is still deficient.

Now, Liezi rides the wind and travels, soaring lightly and skillfully.

**[Commentary]**
"泠然" describes a light and wondrous manner.

**[Subcommentary]**
His surname is Lie, given name Yukou, a native of Zheng. A contemporary of Duke Zhuang of Zheng, he studied under Master Huqiu Zilin and authored eight scrolls. Having attained the Dao of wind immortality, he rides the wind in travel, ascending lightly—hence his skill is praised. After fifteen days, he returns.

**[Commentary]**
If one still depends on something, then even riding the wind, one cannot circumnavigate in a single moment.

**[Subcommentary]**
"旬" means ten days. Having attained the wind immortal’s Dao, he roams the world, returning home every fifteen days. Yet he cannot ride all things without exception, so he cannot act in a single moment.

In his attainment of fortune, he is not restless.

**[Commentary]**
He naturally rides the wind; he does not eagerly seek it.

**[Subcommentary]**
"致" means "to attain." Lie Yukou’s attainment of the fortune of wind immortality arises from his indifference to heat and cold, his empty mind following its course—it is not a matter of striving with intent or eagerly pursuing. This clarifies the essentials of the Dao: the essence lies in forgetting the mind. If one employs and exhausts intellect and thought, one strays far from it. Though he avoids walking, he still depends on something.

**[Commentary]**
Without wind, he cannot travel—this is necessarily dependence. Only one who rides all things without exception is without dependence.

**[Subcommentary]**
Riding the wind and ascending lightly, though he avoids walking, he cannot advance without wind—he still requires something to depend on. From officials downward through Song Rong and Lie Yukou, though their wisdom and virtue differ in excellence, none have thoroughly forgotten, and all remain in dependence. Only by following the nature of the myriad things, wandering the paths of transformation, and achieving all without exception can one fully realize the wondrous attainment of carefree wandering.

If one rides the inherent principle of Heaven and Earth and harnesses the transformations of the six qi to wander boundlessly—what does such a one depend on?

**[Commentary]**
"Heaven and Earth" is the collective name for the myriad things. Heaven and Earth take the myriad things as their body, and the myriad things in turn take spontaneity as their inherent principle. Spontaneity is that which is not contrived yet arises naturally. Thus, the great Peng’s ability to soar high, the sparrow’s ability to fly low, the great tree’s ability to grow tall, and the morning mushroom’s ability to be short—all these are what spontaneity enables, not what contrivance enables. Not contrived yet naturally able—this is the inherent principle. Thus, to ride the inherent principle of Heaven and Earth is to follow the nature of the myriad things; to harness the transformations of the six qi is to wander the paths of change. Proceeding thus, where could there be any limit? Whatever one encounters, one rides—what, then, would one depend on?

This is the freedom of those of utmost virtue who mystically unite self and other. If there is dependence, then even the lightness and wonder of Liezi would still be unable to travel without wind—only when he obtains what he depends on can he be free, let alone the great Peng. Only those who merge with things and follow great transformation can be without dependence and ever-pervading—how could this be merely self-pervading? Moreover, by following those who depend, one ensures they do not lose what they depend on; when what they depend on is not lost, they become one with the great pervasion. Thus, I cannot equate the dependent and the non-dependent; but as for each resting in its nature, the heavenly mechanism unfolding of itself, receiving without awareness—these I cannot distinguish. For even the non-dependent are not sufficient to distinguish themselves from the dependent, let alone the great and small among the dependent.

[Commentary] "Heaven and Earth" is the collective name for the myriad things. "The myriad things" is another name for spontaneity. As for the six qi, Ji Yi said: dawn’s morning glow, midday’s pure yang, sunset’s flying springs, midnight’s vast dampness—these are the six qi of Heaven and Earth. Du Yu said: the six qi are yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness. Zhi Daolin said: the six qi are Heaven, Earth, and the four seasons; *bian* means transformation. *Wu hu*, what does one depend on?

The non-dependent sage, emptying the heart-mind and embodying the Dao, thus can ride the inherent principle of the Two Modes, follow the spontaneity of the myriad things, harness the six qi to wander freely, and blend with all spirits in transformation. If one is without things yet does not follow, where could one not pervade? Clearly seeing through to the limitless, what would one depend on?

Thus it is said: the perfected person is without self—
[Annotation] Without self, thus following things; following things, one reaches the utmost.

the spirit person is without achievement—
[Annotation] Things have never declined from arising naturally, yet they rejoice in relying on acupuncture and stone needles—thus when principle reaches its limit, they perish. Now, following without aiding, one becomes one with the utmost principle—thus without achievement.

the sage is without fame.
[Annotation] The sage is merely the name for things attaining their nature; it is insufficient to name how they attain it.

[Commentary] "Perfected" speaks of their essence, "spirit" of their function, "sage" of their name. Thus, in speaking of essence, one says "perfected"; of function, "spirit"; of name, "sage"—in reality, they are one. Reaching the ultimate of numinous power, they are called "perfected"; being unfathomable as yin and yang, they are called "spirit"; rightly naming the hundred things, they are called "sage." Above one person, these three exist—desiring to display their differing functions and names, they are distinguished as three persons. These three persons are those who earlier rode the inherent principle of Heaven and Earth and harnessed the transformations of the six qi. Desiring to conclude this person’s non-dependent virtue and manifest their essence and function, one speaks in reverse, thus saying:

Yao offered the world to Xu You, saying: "When the sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still does not cease—is it not difficult for it to shine? When the season has descended, yet one still irrigates—is it not laborious for it to moisten?"

[Commentary] Yao was the son of Emperor Ku, surnamed Yi Qi, style Fangxun. His mother, Qingdu, conceived him after sensing a red dragon. He was ten feet tall, broad above and full below, with eight-colored eyebrows and feet treading the stars of the Dipper. He possessed sagely virtue. At fifteen, he served the Lord of Tang; at twenty-one, he succeeded his brother to the imperial throne, establishing his capital at Pingyang, and was called Lord of Taotang. After seventy-two years on the throne, he abdicated to Shun. He died at 128 and was buried in Yangcheng, posthumously named Yao. According to the rules of posthumous naming, "Yao" means "winged goodness transmitting sagacity," referring to his merit in transmitting the throne to Shun.

Xu You was a recluse, surnamed Xu, named You, style Zhongwu, from Yangcheng in Yingchuan. He lived in seclusion on Mount Ji, studied under Nie Que, ate from the mountains, and drank from the river. Yao, knowing his worth, offered him the imperial throne. Xu You, hearing this, went to the river to wash his ears. When Chaofu came to water his calf, he led it away, saying: "It would pollute my water." After his death, Yao had his tomb sealed and posthumously named him Lord of Ji—he was Yao’s teacher.

"When the sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still does not cease—is it not difficult for it to shine? When the season has descended, yet one still irrigates—is it not laborious for it to moisten?"

[Commentary] "Jiao fire" refers to torch fire, a small flame. In the time of Shennong, rain fell once every fifteen days, called "timely rain." Moreover, with the sun and moon illuminating all, why rely on the light of torches? With timely rain soaking the earth, why labor over irrigation? Yao, in his humility and deference, yielded to others and withdrew himself—these words serve to extol Zhongwu. "If the Master were to stand as ruler, the world would be well-ordered, yet I still occupy his place. I see myself as lacking. I beg to yield the world to him."

[Commentary] "Well-ordered" means properly governed. "Occupy" means to preside. "Yield" means to offer. As Yao took Xu You as his teacher, he addressed him as "Master." If Zhongwu were to ascend the throne, the realm would surely attain great peace, yet I still hold sway as its lord. Seeing myself as insufficient, I ask to relinquish the imperial position to a worthy man.

Xu You said: "You govern the world, and the world is already well-ordered."

[Annotation] He who can bring order to the world does not govern it. Thus, Yao ordered it by not governing, not by governing to order it. Now that Xu You clearly sees it is already well-ordered, there is nothing for him to replace. Yet the order truly comes from Yao, hence the words "you govern it." One should forget the words and seek the meaning they convey. Some, however, claim: "He who governs to order it is Yao; he who does not govern yet enables Yao to order it is Xu You." This is far from the truth. Order arises from non-governance, action emerges from non-action. Yao’s sufficiency requires no borrowing from Xu You. To suggest that only by withdrawing into mountain forests can one be called "non-acting" is the very reason why the teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi are rejected by those in power. Those who remain bound to the realm of action without returning—this is the source of such errors.

[Commentary] "Well-ordered" means governed. "Already" means fully. Yao governed the world for so long that it reached peace, with all under heaven tranquil. Why trouble me with such excessive words? Yet in Zhuangzi’s text, Yao is belittled while Xu You is exalted, while Guo Xiang’s commentary disparages Xu You and praises Yao—why? To show that the sagely Yao and the worthy Zhongwu, though both great, follow different paths, separated by a vast distance. Thus, Yao, bearing the weight of the world, lost it, while Xu You, untouched by custom, stood alone on a high mountain. Their differing fates are clear. Zhuangzi, invoking the theme of abdication, spoke of torch fires; Guo Xiang, discerning the heart of non-reliance, expounded on non-governance. This may be called delving into subtleties and uncovering hidden truths, aligning text with meaning. One should seek its intent, not quibble over details.

"Yet I would still replace you—would I do so for the sake of a name? A name is but the guest of reality. Would I seek to be a guest?"

[Annotation] He who takes responsibility for himself, in harmony with things, is without opposition to them. Thus, Yao was without opposition to the world, and Xu You stood as an equal to Qi and Xie. How can this be said? He who merges with things cannot be separated from them. Therefore, with a mind free and responses mysterious, he follows only what moves him, drifting like an untethered boat, unconcerned with east or west. Thus, he acts without sharing with the people, and rules without becoming the world’s lord. To rule in this way is like heaven’s natural height—this is the true virtue of a ruler. If one stands alone atop a high mountain, not out of human sentiment for self-preservation but to uphold a partial view, how can this be exclusive? He is but one among the common folk, an outer minister to Yao. To treat an outer minister as an inner lord is to bear the name of ruler without its reality.

[Commentary] Xu You, aloof on Mount Ji, wandering by the Ying River, spurned fame and profit, despising the filth of reputation. Yet Yao, earnest in his entreaties, still hoped Xu You would replace him. If Xu You ascended the throne, he would gain the name of emperor. Yet reality gives rise to name, and name follows reality. Reality is inner and primary; name is outer and secondary. To abandon the primary for the secondary, to lose the inner in pursuit of the outer—this is not the aspiration of a recluse, hence his words: "Would I seek to be a guest?"

The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs no more than a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes no more than its fill.

[Annotation] Each nature has its limit. If that limit is satisfied, the rest of the world’s wealth is superfluous.

[Commentary] The *jiaoliao* is the wren, a clever bird, also called the "female artisan" or "peach insect," skilled at nesting in dense thickets. The *yan shu* is a creature the size of an ox, black in color, with cloven hooves, three claws on each foot, ears like an elephant’s, and a white-tipped tail, fond of drinking from rivers. The bird nests beyond a single branch without needing a vast forest; the beast drinks beyond its fill without requiring a boundless expanse.

Moreover, Xu You found contentment in humble thatch and lotus roots, spurning the golden gates; he delighted in coarse fare, scorning the finest delicacies. "Return and rest, my lord—I have no use for the realm."

[Annotation] All things are equally without use, yet Yao alone possessed it. This shows that those who embrace openness know no bounds, and so the world delights in exalting them without weariness.

[Commentary] *Yu* means "I." Xu You, with his few desires and pure tranquility, declined Yao’s abdication, saying to Yao: "You should swiftly return to the imperial carriage, go back to the Purple Palace, and let the words of abdication be at rest. The honor of the Four Seas is of no use to me; what would I do with the nobility of the Nine-Five?" Though the kitchen servant may not tend the kitchen, the invocator and officiant do not overstep their bounds to take his place at the wine vessel and meat platter.

[Annotation] The kitchen servant, the invocator, and the officiant each abide in their proper office. Birds, beasts, and the myriad things each find sufficiency in what they receive. Emperor Yao and Xu You each remain at peace with their lot—this is the ultimate truth of the world. When each attains their truth, what more is there to do? They find contentment in themselves. Thus, though the conduct of Yao and Xu differed, in their freedom they were one.

[Commentary] The *paoren* is the one who oversees the kitchen, equivalent to today’s imperial caterer. The *shi* is the spirit tablet in the ancestral temple; the *zhu* is today’s Grand Invocator of the Court of Sacrifices. Holding the ritual tablets, they invoke before the *shi*, hence the term *shizhu*. The *zun* is a wine vessel; the *zu* is a meat platter. The kitchen servant, invocator, and officiant each have their appointed roles. Even if the chef were negligent and refused to prepare the meal, the invocator and officiant would never overstep their bounds, abandon their vessels, and take up the knife to cook. Just so, when Emperor Yao abdicated and did not govern the realm, Xu You did not leave his mountain forest to ascend the throne. Thus the annotation says: "Emperor Yao and Xu You each remained at peace with what they had."

Jian Wu asked Lian Shu: "I heard words from Jie Yu—"

[Commentary] Jian Wu and Lian Shu were both men of the Dao in ancient times. Jie Yu was surnamed Lu, named Tong, styled Jie Yu, a worthy recluse of Chu who lived at the same time as Confucius. Feigning madness and refusing office, he devoted himself to farming. When the King of Chu, knowing his worth, offered him a hundred *yi* of gold and two teams of four horses, he declined. Then, shouldering his belongings with his wife following behind, he wandered among mountains and seas, and none knew where he ended his days. Jian Wu, finding Jie Yu’s words unbounded and without measure, asked Lian Shu to clarify their meaning. "I heard words from Jie Yu" means he heard Jie Yu’s speech. Zhuangzi cited these three worthies to illustrate Yao’s singular sagacity; the content of what he heard is set forth below.

"—vast and without limit, sweeping onward without return. I was alarmed by his words, as though the Milky Way stretched endlessly without bound."

[Commentary] What he heard from Jie Yu was grand yet without proper measure, advancing in a single direction with no trace of return. I secretly heard it with shock and dread, like gazing at the celestial river, lofty and distant, its source and flow utterly unfathomable.

"They were wildly divergent, far from human sentiment."

[Commentary] *Jingting* means "excessive," also describing a direct advance without regard. Jie Yu’s words did not align with the common, often exceeding bounds and defying worldly norms—hence his grand speech did not accord with reason.

Lian Shu said: "What did his words say?"

"On the distant Mount Gushe, there dwells a spirit-like person—skin like ice and snow, supple and graceful as a maiden."

[Annotation] These are but figurative words. The "spirit-like person" is what we now call the sage. Though the sage may sit in the halls of state, his heart remains no different than if he dwelt in the mountains and forests. How could the world recognize this? They see only his imperial yellow canopy and jade-encrusted girdle, and think these suffice to bind his heart; they see him traverse mountains and rivers, sharing in the people’s labors, and think these suffice to weary his spirit. How could they know that the most perfect remains unharmed? Now, by speaking of one of royal virtue and placing him on this mountain, we illuminate how the world fails to recognize him—thus we set him beyond the farthest borders and relegate him beyond sight and sound. As for the maiden? She is not inwardly wounded by outward things.

[Commentary] *Miao* means "distant." The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: Mount Gushe lies beyond the encircling sea, where a spirit-like sage dwells, gathering responses to the world. When the moment calls for bows and courtesy, he becomes a Yao or Shun; when the moment calls for shield and spear, he becomes a Tang or Wu.

Graceful and yielding—this is softness. The *chü-tzu* is an unmarried maiden. To speak of the sage is to show how movement and stillness respond as one, how emptiness and being illuminate together. Though he dwells in the halls of state, he is no different from one in the mountains and forests. He harmonizes his light with the dust, abiding in defilement yet undefiled. Ice and snow are chosen for their purity and cold; gracefulness is likened to gentleness and harmony; the *chü-tzu* is not harmed by things; Mount Gushe speaks of its remoteness. This clarifies the fullness of Yao’s virtue—profound, dark, and wondrous—thus placing him beyond the farthest borders, relegating him beyond sight and sound. Yet this is but a parable; how could there truly be a Mount Gushe? One ought to forget words and seek what they point to. This is the very passage where Jian Wu, deluded by his former understanding, responds to Lian Shu.

He eats no grain, drinking the wind and sipping the dew.
*[Annotation]* Though all consume the five grains, only the spirit-person is not made by them, for the spirit-person is uniquely endowed with the wondrous qi of nature.
*[Commentary]* The five grains are millet, sorghum, hemp, beans, and wheat. The spirit-like sage, descending to respond to things, is born with pure and essential numinosity, endowed with the finest qi of yin and yang. Though he relies on things for sustenance, he is not made by the five grains; though he cleaves to wind and dew for clarity and emptiness, he is not altered by the four seasons.

He rides the clouds and qi, drives flying dragons, and roams beyond the four seas.
*[Commentary]* His wisdom illuminates with numinous penetration, his original heart follows things—thus he rides the clouds and qi. Swift without haste, ever-changing yet constant—thus he drives flying dragons. Borne upon the ten thousand things yet transcending the six directions—thus he advances beyond the four seas.

His spirit congeals, so that things are free from blight and pestilence, and the year’s harvest ripens. Yet I deem this mad and do not believe it.
*[Annotation]* One who embodies spirit, abides in numinosity, and exhausts the subtleties of principle—though silent and still within the quiet chamber—is mystically one with the farthest reaches of the four seas. Thus he rides the Two Modes and drives the Six Qi, harmonizing with the multitude of beings and taming the ten thousand things. If he were not in accord with things, he would ride the floating clouds; if he were not borne by form, he would drive flying dragons. Forgetting the self and attaining the self, though seemingly indifferent and without reliance, sitting in forgetfulness and walking in forgetfulness, acting in forgetfulness—thus his movements are like dragging a withered tree, his stillness like a heap of dead ashes. Hence it is said his spirit congeals. When his spirit congeals, what does not congeal attains the self. Yet the world judges by what it sees—how could it ever believe this?
*[Commentary]* *Congeals* means still. *Blight and pestilence* mean illness and disease. *The year’s harvest ripens* means a good year. The sage’s form is like a withered tree, his heart like dead ashes, his essence pervading the moment, movement and stillness both wondrous. His congealed illumination flows unimpeded, his empty mind benefits things. Thus the four seasons follow their order, the five grains flourish, people are free from calamity, and things are free from untimely death. Such is the sage’s power in the world. Yet Jian Wu, failing to grasp these profound words, deems them mad and does not believe.

Lian Shu said: Indeed. The blind have no part in the sight of patterns, the deaf no part in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that has deafness and blindness? Knowledge, too, has them.
*[Annotation]* Not knowing the ultimate subtlety of profound words and deeming them mad and unbelievable—this is the deafness and blindness of knowledge.
*[Commentary]* The blind have eyes like drumskin, dark and sealed. The deaf suffer from an affliction of the ears. The blind have ruined eye-faculties. Sight and hearing are the common conditions of beings with form. Yet the blind and deaf cannot be shown sights and sounds. Likewise, the profound words of the wondrous Dao are known only by those of suspended understanding. The deluded and confused, however, remain unenlightened their whole lives, for their wisdom is obstructed and blind. Is this affliction unique to the body? From here onward is Lian Shu’s reply to Jian Wu.

These words are like a maiden in her chamber.
*[Annotation]* These words of Jie Yu are naturally sought by things, yet those whose knowledge is deaf and blind deem them impossible.
*[Commentary]* *These* is a pointing word. *A maiden in her chamber* is a young, unmarried woman. These words of Jie Yu are like a graceful and pure maiden, sought by the noble man, yet those whose knowledge is deaf and blind say such a thing is impossible.

This person, this power—who would exhaust themselves with the world’s affairs, laboring over governance?
*[Annotation]* The sage’s heart encompasses the ultimate convergence of the Two Modes and exhausts the wondrous numbers of the ten thousand things. Thus he embodies transformation and harmonizes change, with nothing beyond his reach, uniting the ten thousand things without their being otherwise. The world, in its chaos, seeks him, yet he has no mind. If he had no mind, how could he not respond to the world? Yet one who embodies the profound and exhausts the wondrous—though he harmonizes the natures of the ten thousand things and shapes the transformations of the world to achieve the renown of Yao and Shun—always does so by not-doing. Who would exhaust themselves with laborious thoughts and toilsome governance, making affairs their affair, and only then succeed?
*[Commentary]* *This* is an exclamatory particle. *Uniting* means blending as one. *Seeks* means to request. *Who* means no one. *This person* praises Yao as a sage; *this power* extols Yao’s great virtue. The sage’s power accords with the Two Modes, his Dao levels the myriad kinds, blending the ten thousand things and mastering the hundred spirits. When the world is decadent and the people in chaos, they seek the great sage to govern and pacify. Yet like an empty boat or a suspended mirror, he responds without intent. Who would weary their form and exhaust their wisdom, managing the realm, making affairs their affair, and only then succeed?

Thus *Laozi* states: "Act without acting, manage without managing," and further declares: "To take the world, one must always act without acting; when one acts with acting, it is insufficient to take the world."

This person—nothing harms them.
*[Annotation]* One who rests in what harms them cannot be harmed; when harm cannot harm, then things do not harm them.

Great floods reach the heavens yet do not drown them; great droughts melt metal and stone, scorch mountains and earth, yet do not burn them.
*[Annotation]* Without going and without resting, wherever they are is fitting. Death and life hold no change for them—how much less drowning or burning?

Thus the perfected person does not cling to calamity and disaster, not by avoiding them, but by advancing straight through principle, naturally meeting with good fortune.
*[Commentary]* *Stabilized* means to reach. One who penetrates life and death knows no death and no life; one who is fitting with water and fire is neither drowned nor burned. Even if the Yang-nine disaster melts metal or the Hundred-six calamity floods the heavens, chaos arises from others—what does it matter to them? Thus *Guo’s Annotation* says: "Death and life hold no change for them—how much less drowning or burning?"

Their dust and grime, their husks and chaff, are what would mold and cast into Yao and Shun. Who would take things as their affair?
*[Annotation]* Yao and Shun are but names of worldly affairs; one who acts for a name is not the name. Thus Yao and Shun—are they merely Yao and Shun? No! Their hexagrams hold the reality of spirit-like persons. What we call Yao and Shun are but the dust and grime, the husks and chaff of their names.
*[Commentary]* *Scattered* becomes dust, *greasy* becomes grime; *unripe grain* is husk, *grain husk* is chaff—all coarse things. *Melting metal* is casting, *molding clay* is pottery. *Yi’s model*: "Wings of goodness transmit sageliness" is Yao; "transforming sageliness into radiant brightness" is Shun. Yao’s root reaches the ultimate, wondrously transcending form and name, blending and advancing with the dust—things savor his power, so he establishes the name *Yi* to manifest his sagely body. Yet names are crude models, no different from husks; *Yi* is a worldly affair, what separates it from dust? Thus, flatterers and deceivers falsely forge that dust and grime into Yao, use these husks and chaff to craft Shun. How could they know the wondrous body cannot be spoken? This is why no one would take things as their affair.

The people of Song carried ceremonial caps to Yue, but the Yue people, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them.
*[Commentary]* This begins the analogy. *Carried* means to trade. Yue, bordering rivers and lakes, shaves its hair and tattoos its body to avoid the harm of dragons. *Zhangfu* is the name of a cap. Thus Confucius, born in Lu, wore robes with wide sleeves; raised in Song, he wore the *zhangfu* cap. Song was the descendant of Weizi; Yue was the lineage of Taibo. The two states traded and interacted, making *zhangfu* a commodity. Yet *zhangfu* is meant to adorn the head, requiring hair to hold the cap—Yue people, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, rendered the commodity useless. Just as glory and splendor are inherently clinging, wealth and nobility arise from arrogance and pride. Yao, embodying the Dao and penetrating forgetfulness, could thus have no use for the world. Thus *Guo’s Annotation* says: "Yao’s having no use for governing the world is like the Yue people having no use for *zhangfu*."

Yao governed the people of the world and harmonized the governance of the seas within, yet when he went to see the Four Masters on the distant Guye Mountain, north of the Fen River, he suddenly lost his world.
*[Annotation]* Yao’s having no use for governing the world is like the Yue people having no use for *zhangfu*. Yet one who abandons the world is truly revered by the world. Though the world reveres Yao, Yao never possessed the world. Thus he lost it in a daze, having long roamed his mind in the boundless dark, though seated atop the ten thousand things, he had never ceased to be free and unfettered. The Four Masters are but figurative speech, clarifying that Yao is not confined to being Yao. Yao is truly dark and obscure—his emergence is Yao. Viewing obscurity from emergence, inner and outer are different realms—this is no wonder. The world only sees Yao as Yao, how could they recognize his obscurity? Thus, seeking the Four Masters beyond the seas while fixing Yao to what is seen, and then claiming those who flow with things lose their freedom, misses the truth. For one who follows the farthest reaches knows that compliance is nearer, and the highest convergence is lower. If one rigidly exalts uniqueness as supreme and does not level with worldly entanglements, they are but a mountain-valley scholar, not one who transcends dependency—how could they speak of the ultimate or wander the boundless?
*[Commentary]* *Governed* means to order and manage; *governance* refers to moral instruction.

This is a combined metaphor. The Fen River originates in Taiyuan and flows westward into the Yellow River. North of the water is called *yang*—today’s Pingyang County in Jinzhou lies north of the Fen River, where Yao once established his capital. *Baoran* signifies stillness and solitude, a term for profound remoteness. *Sang* means forgetting, denoting the act of relinquishment and dissolution. As for the Four Masters, they represent the Four Virtues: first, the root; second, compliance; third, neither root nor emergence; fourth, neither non-root nor emergence. It speaks of Yao turning inward to illuminate the source of the mind, penetratingly beholding the realm of the Dao, transcending these four distinctions—hence it is said he went to meet the Four Masters.

The sage has no fixed mind; responding only when moved, he thus orders and harmonizes the myriad states, bringing peace to the nine lands. Though he concentrates his spirit upon the Four Masters, sitting in solemn repose north of the Fen, governing the ten thousand affairs, he remains *baoran*, having forgotten the world. This is the convergence of root and emergence, of substance and function, the dual illumination of emptiness and being, the simultaneity of movement and stillness. Thus, the Maiden Peak of Guye is no different from the northern bank of the Fen, and how could mountain forests be distinct from the imperial palace? Yet the world equalizes only what it sees—when has it ever trusted this truth?

Yet Ma Biao’s reduction of the Four Masters to Nie Que fails to grasp the profound principle, while Liu Zhang’s transposition of the Fen River to Mount She only compounds confusion in immediate matters. The present explication diverges somewhat from these views.

Thus, Guo Xiang’s commentary states: “The Four Masters are but figurative expressions, revealing that Yao was not confined to ‘Yao’—the world sees only Yao’s emergence, how could it recognize his true reality?”

Master Hui said to Master Zhuang: “The King of Wei bestowed upon me seeds of a great gourd. (Annotation: His surname was Hui, given name Shi, a native of Song. He served as Prime Minister of Liang. *Wei* here refers to King Hui of Liang, who originally ruled from Anyi under the state name Wei. Later, pressed by the might of Qin, he relocated to Daliang and renamed his state Liang, usurping the title of king.) Master Hui raised this metaphor of the great gourd to satirize Master Zhuang’s writings—though their purport is vast, they fail to address practical affairs, hence this exchange to provoke further discourse.

“I planted them, and when they bore fruit, it held five *dan*. When I used it to contain water or broth, its fragility prevented it from supporting its own weight. (Annotation: *Shu* means to cultivate. *Shi* refers to the fruit. Having obtained the gourd seeds, Master Hui planted them until they matured, yielding fruit so large it could hold five *dan*. Yet when used to contain liquids, its hollow brittleness rendered it unable to bear its own weight.) When I split it to make ladles, its shallowness left nothing to hold. Though it was resplendently vast, I deemed it useless and smashed it. (Annotation: *Pou* means to split. *Piao* is a ladle. *Huluo* describes its flatness. *Yangran* denotes its vast emptiness. *Pou* means to shatter. Used to hold water, its brittleness made it unsustainable; split into ladles, its shallowness could contain little. Deemed utterly useless, it was broken and discarded.) This mocks Master Zhuang’s words for failing to address the exigencies of the age—like this gourd, they ought to be cast aside.”

Master Zhuang replied: “You are indeed inept at putting great things to use. There was a man of Song skilled in making an ointment that prevented chapping of the hands. For generations, his family made their living by washing silk floss in water. (Annotation: This ointment kept hands from cracking, allowing them to constantly soak floss in water. *Hong* means to float; *you*, to drift. *Huang* refers to silk floss. *Shishi* means for years. In the depths of winter, the man of Song waded into water to wash floss, his fingers cracking like tortoise shells. Thus, his family passed down this ointment through generations, ensuring their hands remained unchapped and their livelihood of washing floss in water endured without decline. Alternate reading: *pi* means to prepare; *tong*, to continue.)”

The client, having heard of this, offered to buy the formula for a hundred *jin* of gold. (Annotation: A *jin* of gold refers to a gold ingot measuring one *cun* in size and weighing one *jin*.) A visitor from another state happened to learn of it and sought to purchase the remedy for chapped hands, offering a hundred *jin* of gold. The family gathered to deliberate, saying: “For generations, we have washed silk floss and earned no more than a few *jin* of gold. Now, in a single morning, we can sell this skill for a hundred *jin*—let us give it to him.” (Annotation: *Chang* means to sell. The price being so high, the family conferred. For generations, they had floated and washed floss, reaping meager profit, but selling the remedy in one stroke would bring vast wealth. With one voice, they agreed to the sale.)

The client obtained it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue posed a threat, the King of Wu appointed him as a general. In winter, he engaged the Yue forces in a naval battle, decisively defeating them, and was enfeoffed with land in reward. (Annotation: Wu and Yue were northern neighbors, their lands bordering rivers and seas, their weapons clashing like hills. In winter, the soldiers’ hands often cracked. The client, endowed with heroic talent and natural intelligence, having acquired the formula, persuaded the King of Wu. When Yue’s troops invaded Wu, the king made him a general. Relying on this renowned remedy, his soldiers’ hands did not chap. The moment banners were raised, the Yue forces fell into disarray. Achieving such a great victory, he returned in triumph, his merit and service duly recognized, and was granted a fief of thatched earth.)

The same remedy prevented chapped hands, yet one man used it to gain a fief, while another remained content with washing silk floss—such is the difference in how it was employed. (Annotation: *Huo* means indeterminate. The formula was equally effective, but its users differed in skill, so the traveler gained a marquisate while the Song man used it for washing floss. This illustrates the disparity in their application.)

“Now, you have a gourd of five *shi* capacity—why not hollow it out to make a great flotation vessel and drift upon the rivers and lakes? Instead, you fret that it is too large to hold anything. Truly, your mind is as tangled as the *peng* grass.” (Annotation: *Peng* refers to one who lacks direct understanding. This chapter shows that all things have their proper use; if one finds the right application, how can one not attain freedom?)

(Annotation: *Ju* means to bind with ropes. A *zun* is a vessel lacquered like a wine cup, secured with cords, used to cross rivers and lakes—what the southerners call a “waist boat.” *Peng* is the name of a grass that curls and does not grow straight. *Fu* is an exclamatory particle. A great gourd, floating upon rivers and lakes, can serve as a boat to prevent drowning; the profound teachings, when put into practice, can ferry the lost across the world. Yet Master Hui, his mind as tangled as *peng* grass, fails to grasp the subtle principle and instead raises frivolous objections, mocking Zhuangzi’s writings. To misuse things so is deeply regrettable.)

Master Hui said to Master Zhuang: “I have a great tree—people call it the *bo*. (Annotation: The *bo* is a type of lacquer tree, foul-smelling when bruised, a worthless wood. Names in the world are often empty and false; though people call it *bo*, its true nature remains uncertain.) Its trunk is swollen and gnarled, unfit for the carpenter’s line, and its branches are twisted, failing to meet the compass or square. Planted by the roadside, no carpenter would even glance at it. (Annotation: *Yongzhong* means knotted and misshapen; *juanqu*, crooked and unstraight. The compass draws circles, the square measures right angles. The *bo* tree, being useless, has a trunk so gnarled that no line can be applied, and branches so twisted that no compass or square can correct them. Planted by the road, carpenters would not deign to look at it.) Now, your words are grand but of no use—just as the crowd shuns them. (Annotation: Just as the tree is gnarled and useless, ignored by carpenters, so too are your words vast but impractical, rejected by all. This is the analogy.)”

Zhuangzi said: Have you alone not seen the wildcat? It crouches low, lying in wait for the roaming prey; leaping east and west, heedless of high or low; it is caught in the trap’s snare and dies in the hunter’s net.

Now, have you not seen the weasel capturing mice? It lowers its body, lying in ambush for the careless rodent, bounding this way and that, undeterred by uneven ground; yet it is ensnared by the trap’s mechanism and perishes in the net—all for being deluded by petty gain, never considering the greater consequence. This is no different from those who bow and scrape, clutching at the skirts of the sage, feigning nature and distorting truth to seize fleeting advantage. Though they may prosper for a time, they later face ruin—and Shang Yang, Su Qin, and Zhang Yi are just such cases. How is this unlike the weasel that dies in the hunter’s net?

Consider the yak: vast as a cloud trailing across the sky. This creature is great indeed, yet it cannot catch a mouse.

Just as Zhuangzi’s words teach: one who does not fawn upon the vulgar can govern the state and cultivate the self, enduring long and abiding in permanence.

Now, you possess a great tree, yet lament its lack of utility. Why not plant it in the land of *wuheyou*—the boundless wilds? (The *wuheyou* means "nothing possessed," for in that vast and unpeopled expanse, whatever exists is as if it were not, hence the name *wuheyou*.) There, you may wander freely at its side or recline in ease beneath its shade. (The term *panghuang* denotes unconstrained movement, while *xiaoyao* signifies self-contentment—different words expressing the same idea, each lending its own elegance.) This useless tree, with its lush branches and luxuriant leaves, casts a sweeping shade that blocks the sun and welcomes the wind. Travelers passing by linger to rest, pacing to and fro or leaning against its trunk, lying down beneath its boughs. This, too, mirrors Zhuangzi’s teaching: by embracing emptiness and simplicity, one may roam at will and nurture one’s nature, offering shelter to all living beings.

It will not be felled by axes, nor harmed by any thing. Since it has no use, how can it suffer hardship? (For things great and small alike, if they stray from their proper measure, the principles of benefit and harm become the same. But when each is used according to its nature, all things attain freedom.) The tree’s gnarled and twisted form renders it unfit for timber, and no carpenter spares it a glance. The axe will never touch it, so how could the calamity of premature felling befall it? Thus, it fulfills its natural lifespan and exhausts its allotted years. In its uselessness, where lies its hardship? This, again, reflects Zhuangzi’s teaching: by deviating from convention and aligning with the Dao, one may preserve one’s integrity and safeguard one’s true nature—neither cut short by the world’s paths nor ever mired in life’s struggles.

#43 Wang Xiaoyu, following the context below, adds the character "clumsy" (*zhuo*) above "and" (*er*).
#44 The *Quewu* cites the Wen Ruhai edition, where "hardship" (*kun ku*) is rendered as "destitution" (*qiong kun*).

**Preface to the *Nanhua True Scripture***
*By Guo Xiang of Henan, styled Zixuan*

Zhuangzi may be said to have known the root. Thus, he never concealed his unbridled words—utterances that, though vast as the cycles of heaven and earth, respond uniquely to the moment. For if a response does not meet the occasion, even if it aligns with the primordial use, it remains ineffective; and if words do not address the affairs of things, even if lofty, they will not circulate. Compared to those who remain still until compelled to act, Zhuangzi’s approach is fundamentally distinct. This is what it means to know the primordial mind.

When the mind is primordial, it responds to stimuli as they arise, adapting to the times, its words ever measured. Thus, it embodies transformation, flowing through the ages to merge with things—how could it ever contrive opposition, encountering the singular to wander in discourse beyond the bounds of convention? This is why his work, though not canonical, stands as the crown of the Hundred Schools.

Yet while Zhuangzi may not have fully embodied it, his words reach the utmost. They unify the order of heaven and earth, sequence the natures of the myriad things, penetrate the changes of life and death, and illuminate the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship. Above, he knows the Creator and the primordial absence of things; below, he knows how things arise of themselves. His words are vast and expansive, his meaning profound and wondrous. The Way in its perfection is subtle and refined; serene and unconstrained, it is free yet not dissolute.

Thus, he says: not knowing where righteousness leads, one may act wildly yet tread the great square; chewing one’s food, one rejoices in simplicity; drumming one’s belly, one wanders in boundless vastness. Supreme benevolence reaches the absence of partiality; filial piety and kindness culminate in mutual forgetting. Ritual and music revert to innate ability; loyalty and trust emerge from the radiance of heaven. Using this radiance, one’s uncarved simplicity naturally takes form. Therefore, the sacred vessel transforms alone in the mysterious darkness, its source deep and its flow enduring.

Thus, wherever its long waves ripple, wherever its lofty winds fan, it harmonizes with the fittingness of things and accords with the people’s wishes. It broadens the narrow, unties the entangled, and though its liberating work is not yet applied, arrogance and ostentation scatter of themselves. Reading his book, one feels transcendent, as if already attaining the fitting, crossing Kunlun, traversing the great void, and wandering the courts of the indistinct and joyous. Even the greedy and the restless, if they but briefly grasp its lingering fragrance, taste its overflowing stream, or glimpse its echoes and shadows, may yet feel the expansive joy of forgetting form and self-attainment—how much more those who delve into its distant depths and savor its eternal years? Thus, it stretches far and clear, departing from the dust of the world to return to the ultimate darkness.

**Preface to the *Commentary on the Nanhua True Scripture***
*By Master Cheng Xuanying of Xihua, Tang Dynasty*

Zhuangzi’s work expounds the deep roots of virtue and power, elucidates the wondrous purport of the profound mystery, unfolds the primordial uncarved simplicity, and clarifies the office of solitary transformation. It restrains the Nine Schools, encompasses the Hundred Masters, and is indeed the supreme teaching within the realm—truly the subtle words beyond forms.

He was surnamed Zhuang, named Zhou, styled Zixiu, born in Meng County of Suiyang in the state of Song. His teacher was Master Sang of Chang, and he received the title "Immortal of Nanhua." At the beginning of the Warring States period, during the decline of the late Zhou, he lamented the meager karma of the people and grieved the erosion of virtue and power. Thus, with fervent resolve, he composed this discourse.

His words are vast and erudite, his meaning deep and far-reaching—beyond the comprehension of lesser scholars, unfathomable to shallow minds. The term *zi* ("Master") is an honorific for the virtuous; in ancient times, teachers were called *zi*. It is also the title of this book—not merely the collective name for the three Inner Chapters, but a general designation for the Hundred Schools.

The *Inner Chapters* are so named because "inner" stands in contrast to "outer," and "chapters" refers to the arrangement of bamboo slips. In ancient times, bamboo was treated to make slips, bound with leather thongs; when slips were bound into chapters, it was like today’s pages forming a scroll. Thus, the *Yuan Kai* states: great matters are recorded on *ce* (long slips), while minor matters use *du* (short slips). The *Inner Chapters* discuss the root of principle, while the *Outer Chapters* address its peripheral affairs. Though affairs may be manifest, they are not understood without principle; though principle is subtle, it is not revealed without affairs. To first clarify the wondrous principle, the *Inner Chapters* are placed first.

The principles in the *Inner Chapters* are profound, so each chapter is given a separate title outside the text. Guo Xiang’s commentary appears directly beneath these titles, as in *Free and Easy Wandering* and *The Equality of Things*. From the *Outer Chapters* onward, titles are taken from the first two characters of each chapter, as in *Webbed Toes* and *Horses’ Hooves*.

Regarding *Free and Easy Wandering*, interpretations have varied across the ages. Here, I broadly outline the main threads, presenting three explanations:

The first: Gu Tongbai says: *Xiao* means "to dissolve"; *yao* means "distant." Dissolving the burdens of deliberate action, one perceives the principle of non-action. Wandering thus, it is called *xiaoyao*.

The second: Zhi Daolin says: One treats things as things yet is not treated as a thing by them, so one is free (*xiaoran*) without reliance on others. The mysterious response is swift without haste, so one is far-reaching (*yaoran*) without limit. Wandering the world thus, it is called *xiaoyao you* (Free and Easy Wandering).

The third: Mu Ye says: *Xiaoyao* is the name for being uninhibited and self-content. When utmost virtue fills one within, one is not bound by the times; responding to things with forgetfulness, where does one not penetrate? Wandering the world thus, it is called *xiaoyao you*.

The *Inner Chapters* clarify the root of principle; the *Outer Chapters* discuss its proximate affairs; the *Miscellaneous Chapters* intermingle principle and affairs. Though the *Inner Chapters* clarify the root of principle, they do not exclude its peripheral affairs; though the *Outer Chapters* discuss proximate affairs, they contain wondrous principles. The division of teachings into chapters is based on what is most discussed.

Thus, *Free and Easy Wandering* is placed first: it speaks of those who attain the Way—whose wisdom and virtue are bright and keen, whose achievements are always fitting, and who wander freely among things. Therefore, it is named *Free and Easy Wandering*.

The unattached sage, like a mirror reflecting the moment, having clarified the two wisdoms of provisional and real, thus achieves great equality amid the ten thousand conditions—therefore *Equalizing Things* follows next.

Having pointed to the hooves of horses and the heavens-and-earth, merging with the myriad things, with a spirit serene and still, one may grasp the arts of nurturing life—therefore *Nurturing Life* is placed next in order.

Having forgotten both good and evil, with conditions and wisdom both wondrous, following transformations and yielding to change, one may dwell amid the affairs of the human world—therefore *The World of Men* follows next.

With inner virtue complete, one may then extend it outward to engage with things, rising and falling with them, achieving profound harmony within and without—therefore *The Sign of Full Virtue* follows next.

Like still water or flowing reflection, engaging with things without fixed intent, forgetting virtue and forgetting form, attaining the utmost union of inner and outer, one may craft and perfect the myriad beings—therefore *The Great Master* follows next.

The true sages of old, knowing Heaven and knowing man, sharing the work of creation, at once quiescent and responsive, thus guided and governed the multitude—therefore *Responding to Emperors and Kings* follows next.

From *Webbed Toes* onward, each chapter takes two characters from its title as its theme; since they lack distinct meanings, their order is not further discussed here.

Yet since ancient times, recluses of the Jin and Han dynasties have all delighted in these texts, composing commentaries and explanations. Though their annotations leave no room for criticism, and all possess fine phrasing, they uniformly seek out hidden depths.

The unworthy Yan, though lacking discernment, has from youth studied these texts, refining his understanding and delving deeply in thought for thirty years. Following Guo Zixuan’s annotations on the thirty-three chapters, I have ventured to compose an exegesis, compiling thirty fascicles in total. Though my words may be coarse and my insights clumsy, they nonetheless convey the intent and direction of the original; I dare not bequeath them to later generations but merely record them to prevent my own forgetfulness.

*Annotations on the Southern Florescence True Scripture*
*Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan*
*Exegesis by Master Cheng Xuanying of Xihua, Tang Dynasty*

**Inner Chapters: “On the Equality of Things” (Second)**

All things deem themselves right and others wrong, praise themselves and despise others—none are exempt. Thus, though right and wrong differ, self and other are equal.

Nanguo Ziqi leaned against his table and sat, gazing upward and exhaling a sigh, his expression loosened as though he had lost his counterpart.

**Commentary:**
In harmonizing with Heaven and man, equalizing self and other, there is nothing external with which to rejoice; thus, his form dissolved, as if he had lost his mate.

**Exegesis:**
A younger half-brother of King Zhao of Chu and Minister of War under King Zhuang of Chu, his courtesy name was Ziqi. Men of old were simple and unadorned, often named after their dwellings; residing in the southern outskirts, he was called Nanguo, much like Shinan Yiliao or Dongguo Shunzi. A man who embraced the Dao and held fast to virtue, emptying his heart and forgetting worldly cares, Zhuangzi admired his purity and placed him at the outset of this discourse. *Yin* means to lean; *xu*, to sigh. *Kaiyan* describes the manner of release. *Ou* means a mate—here, the pairing of body and spirit, or of self and other. Ziqi, leaning against his table in seated oblivion, concentrated his spirit in distant contemplation, gazed upward and sighed, awakening to the natural, shedding form and discarding knowledge. His expression loosened, body and mind both relinquished, self and other forgotten together, as though he had lost his counterpart.

Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, “How can this be? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, and the heart like dead ashes?”

**Commentary:**
Dead ashes and withered wood are valued for their stillness and absence of emotion. Those who follow the natural and forget right and wrong embody only the spontaneity of Heaven—what else could they possess? Thus, when still, they stand like withered trees; when moving, they sway like dry branches; when seated, they resemble dead ashes; when walking, they drift like dust. I cannot unify their demeanor in motion and rest, nor can I divide their original heart from their self-contentment.

**Exegesis:**
His surname was Yan, given name Yan, courtesy name Ziyou. *Ju* means to dwell or abide. Desiring to seek further instruction, he rose and stood in attendance. How could he abide in such a state, his spirit so serene and still, utterly unlike his former self—his form scarcely different from withered wood, his heart indistinguishable from dead ashes? Marveling at this wondrous transformation, he asked for an explanation. “The one who now leans against the table is not the same as the one who leaned against it before.”

**Commentary:**
Ziyou had often seen others lean against tables, but none like Ziqi.

**Exegesis:**
Ziyou had previously witnessed seated oblivion, but never so profoundly mysterious as this. Now, encountering this tranquil emptiness, he found it unlike anything before. Astonished by his profound stillness, he voiced his surprise. Ziqing said, “Yan, is it not well that you ask? Now I have lost myself—do you understand?”

**Commentary:**
“I have lost myself”—I have forgotten myself. Having forgotten myself, what in the world is there left to recognize? Only by forgetting both inner and outer can one transcend and attain both.

**Exegesis:**
*Er* means “because of you.” *Sang* means to forget. Approving of his question, he said, “Is it not well?” Ziqi had abandoned both worldly knowledge and self, transcending both self and other, yet Ziyou failed to comprehend and reacted with surprise. Thus, he revealed the power of leaning against the table: “Do you understand even this?” “You have heard of the *human* flute but not the *earth* flute; you have heard of the *earth* flute but not the *Heavenly* flute.”

**Commentary:**
A *lai* is a flute. Flutes and pipes vary in length, their notes differing in pitch, producing myriad sounds of varying lengths and heights. Though the sounds are manifold, the measure they follow is one; thus, there is no true distinction between superior and inferior. How much more so with the winds of Heaven and Earth—different sounds yet the same in essence, each taking what is natural to it. In this way, the *Heavenly* flute is revealed.

**Exegesis:**
The *human* flute is the panpipe—one foot and two inches in length, with sixteen pipes, shaped like a phoenix’s wing, created by Shun. Though the pipes vary in length, each receives its due; how much more so with the winds of Heaven and Earth, all attuned to the natural. Thus, through these two worthies, the meaning of the three flutes is illustrated, as explained below.

Ziyou said, “May I ask the method?”

**Exegesis:**
"Method" refers to the unfolding of the Dao. Though one may have heard its name, its meaning remains unclear; thus, he inquires into the three flutes—how do they unfold?

Zicai said: "The great clod exhales qi, and this is called wind."
**Annotation:** The "great clod" is the primordial thing. As for "exhaling qi," how could there be a thing that does so? It is simply that qi gathers and exhales of itself. In the arising of things, none fails to gather and arise of itself; thus, the body of this gathering is vast, and so it is named the "great clod."
**Exegesis:** The "great clod" is the name of the Creator, and also the designation of the natural. It speaks of the principle of the natural, which pervades and gives life to the myriad things, not knowing why it is so yet being so. From within the great clod, qi is exhaled and emerges, and this qi is named wind. It is only when the primordial stirs that the myriad hollows roar and sing.
**Annotation:** It says that wind arises only when the primordial stirs, and when it does, the myriad hollows all rage and resound.
**Exegesis:** "This" refers to this wind. "Stirs" means arises. It speaks of this great wind: only when it does not arise do the myriad hollows remain still; if it moves and stirs, then the countless apertures all drum and roar. Yet have you alone not heard its vastness?
**Annotation:** The sound of the long wind.
The mountain forests’ towering crags,
**Annotation:** The great wind must fan and stir them.
**Exegesis:** "Vast" is the sound of the long wind. "Towering" describes the manner of their fanning. When the clear blasts of the desolate wind strike and surge through the mountain forests, they cause the trees and branches to sway and tremble. Does the world not all hear this in common—why have you alone not heard it? The text below states...

The apertures of great trees a hundred spans in girth resemble noses, resemble mouths, resemble ears, resemble crossbeams, resemble animal pens, resemble mortars, resemble swelling knots, resemble sunken hollows.

**Annotation:** This briefly enumerates the likenesses of the myriad apertures.
**Exegesis:** *Àn xué* (案穴) are tree hollows. *Xī* (析) are the wooden heads of pillars—what we now call *dǒu qiáng* (斗樯). *Quān* (圈) are enclosures for livestock. Trees of a hundred spans in girth have apertures of every strange variety: some resemble the noses of men, some the pens of beasts, some the ear-holes of humans, some the crossbeams of dwellings, some swell and bulge in crooked knots, some sink low and uneven. Their forms and configurations are boundless; here, eight are briefly set forth. This is like the myriad things of the world: their kinds differ, some ugly, some fair, for they receive their endowment from the workings of creation.

Some apertures rush, some whistle, some bark, some inhale, some shriek, some wail, some boom deep, some keen in sorrow.

**Annotation:** This briefly enumerates the differing sounds of the myriad apertures.
**Exegesis:** *Jī* (激) is the sound of rushing water. *Dǎo* (搞) is the sound of an arrowhead’s hollow. *Chì* (叱) is a sharp rebuke. *Xī* (吸) is the sound of breathing. *Jiào* (叫) is the sound of shouting. *Ràng* (让) is the sound of weeping. *Tū* (突) is depth—like a deep valley. *Yǎo* (咬) is a sound of grief and bitterness. Though only eight kinds of tree hollows are briefly listed, when the wind blows through them, it produces eight corresponding sounds. This is like men, who differ in their endowments and vary in their natures, yet each moves according to its nature, and none fails to attain its proper measure. Even if one is small or great, short-lived or long-lived, this is not enough to cause mutual disparagement. The first sings *yú* (于), and those that follow sing *yǎo* (嚼).

A gentle breeze yields a small harmony; a whirlwind yields a great harmony.

**Annotation:** Though the notes and tones of sound may vary infinitely, the harmony—whether in singing or responding, whether great or small—never fails to match what it receives and to be fitting in its measure.
**Exegesis:** *Líng* (泠) is a small wind; *piāo* (飘) is a great wind. *Yú* (于) and *yǎo* (嚼) are both sounds of wind blowing through trees, one following the other. Thus, when a gentle, clear breeze blows, the harmony is small; when a violent, swift whirlwind blows, the harmony is great. Each matches what it receives, with no distinction of superiority or inferiority—just as the myriad things receive their qi naturally.

When the fierce wind ceases, the myriad apertures fall silent.

**Annotation:** *Jì* (济) means to stop. When a violent wind arises, the myriad apertures are full; when it ceases, they are empty. Though emptiness and fullness differ, in each case they attain their proper state.
**Exegesis:** *Lì* (厉) means great or violent. *Jì* (济) means to stop. When the great wind stops, the myriad apertures are empty; when it moves, they are full. Though emptiness and fullness differ, in each case they attain their proper state. This is like the four seasons, which wax and wane, and the two forces, which give life and bring death—all without intent in their nurturing and destruction. How can you alone fail to see them swaying—now *tiáo tiáo* (调调), now *diāo diāo* (刁刁)?

**Annotation:** *Tiáo tiáo diāo diāo* (调调刁刁) describe the manner of movement. Though the sounds of things differ, so too do the movements of their forms. Though their movements differ, they all attain uniformity—how could *tiáo tiáo* alone be right and *diāo diāo* alone be wrong?
**Exegesis:** *Ér* (而) means "you." *Tiáo tiáo diāo diāo* describe the manner of movement. Though the forms of things differ, their movements differ as well. Though there are differences between *tiáo* and *diāo*, in the end there is no distinction of right and wrong. This is like fullness and emptiness, gathering and scattering, life and death, success and failure—all follow the natural principles of things and cannot be otherwise. How could there be judgments of right and wrong, good and bad, among them?

Ziyou said: "The earthly *lài* is simply the myriad apertures; the human *lài* is simply the bamboo flutes. May I ask about the heavenly *lài*?"

**Exegesis:** The earthly *lài* refers to apertures and hollows; the human *lài* refers to flutes and pipes—both are visible and thus knowable. Only the heavenly *lài* is profoundly mysterious and difficult to grasp at once. I humbly present my ignorance and ask to have my doubts resolved.

Ziqing said: "Though the winds of the ten thousand things blow differently, they all allow each to be itself."

**Annotation:** This is the heavenly *lài*. What is the heavenly *lài*? Is there yet another thing apart from it? It is simply the apertures, flutes, and the like, joined with all living things, coming together to form a single heaven. The non-existent cannot give rise to the existent; before existence arises, it cannot be the source of life."

Then who is it that gives life to life? It is simply that each thing arises of itself. It arises of itself—not that I give it life. Since I cannot give life to things, nor can things give life to me, then I am self-so. Being self-so, it is called "natural." It is natural—not made, and thus spoken of as "heavenly." Speaking of it as heavenly is to clarify its self-so nature; how could this refer to the azure vault? Yet some suppose that the heavenly *lài* compels things to follow its will. But if heaven itself cannot possess its own being, how could it possess things? Thus, "heaven" is but the collective name for the ten thousand things. None is uniquely heaven; who then masters and compels things? Each thing generates itself, with no source from which it emerges—this is the Dao of heaven.

**Exegesis:** "Heaven" is the collective name for the ten thousand things, an alternate term for the self-so. How could it refer to the azure vault? Thus, the heavenly *lài*—is there yet another thing apart from it? It is simply these apertures and bamboo flutes joined with all living things. Who, then, gives life to life? It is the primal thing. Therefore, externally it does not depend on things, and internally it does not rely on me; it arises in solitude, transforming alone. As Guo’s commentary states: "Being self-so, it is called 'natural.'" Thus, speaking of it as "natural" clarifies its self-so nature.

And yet, "the winds of the ten thousand things blow differently." Though wind is one, apertures are myriad. Though they differ in size, each accords with what it receives, all following their own knowing—how could they rely on another? This is the heavenly *lài*. Thus we know that spring’s growth and summer’s lengthening, the seeing of eyes and hearing of ears—whether drawing near to the body or entrusting to things afar—all proceed without knowing their source, all remain unaware of their cause. Each follows its own nature, fulfills its allotted portion, and moves according to its inherent disposition, not by the designs of mind or intellect. This is what is meant by "nourishing and fostering them"—the great meaning of the heavenly *lài*. All things take for themselves; who then is the one who angers?

**Annotation:** Things all attain their own nature; who is the master that angers them into being so? This further clarifies the heavenly *lài*.

**Exegesis:** "Take for themselves" means to attain their own nature. Though winds and apertures differ, and forms and sounds vary, each attains its own fulfillment, never unequal. Yet when anger stirs into sound, who causes it to be so? To illustrate: the entanglements of living beings, the disparities of the ten thousand images—each attains what is within its portion, never lacking. Whether flying or walking, who determines it to be so? Thus we know that "stirring and rousing them," there is no master discernible. This further clarifies the meaning of the heavenly *lài*.

The great wisdom is leisurely; the petty wisdom is meddlesome.
**Annotation:** This refers to the difference in knowing.
**Exegesis:** "Leisurely" means expansive and unhurried. "Meddlesome" means to discriminate. Those of great wisdom and broad virtue follow their nature in emptiness and simplicity, without affirming or negating. Those of petty wisdom and narrow ability are constrained in spirit, grasping and rejecting. Thus they are divided and discriminating. Without affirmation or negation, they remain leisurely and expansive.

The great words blaze; the petty words prattle.
**Annotation:** This refers to the difference in speech.
**Exegesis:** "Blaze" means fierce and intense. "Prattle" means verbose and wasteful. Great words that expound the Dao are like a raging fire sweeping across the plain, clearing away all remnants. The petty words of the Confucians and Mohists are mired in contention, merely verbose with no benefit to the teaching.

In sleep, their spirits intermingle; in waking, their forms open.
**Annotation:** This refers to the difference between waking and sleeping.
**Exegesis:** The minds of the vulgar are restless and agitated, clinging to external objects without respite. Thus, in dreams, their spirits recklessly intermingle; in waking, their forms open to engage and be tainted.

They engage and construct, daily contending in the heart. Some are slack, some are entrenched, some are secretive.
**Annotation:** This refers to the difference in engagement.
**Exegesis:** "Construct" means to join. "Entrenched" means deeply fixed (as in storing grain in an underground pit). "Secretive" means hidden. Engaging with worldly affairs, joining root and dust, the deluded mind grows heavy, insatiably craving more. Thus they cherish every moment, their hearts contending with the days. As their minds pursue objects and their natures vary endlessly, broadly speaking, there are these three distinctions.

In minor fear, they tremble; in great fear, they despond.
**Annotation:** This refers to the difference in fear and dread.
**Exegesis:** "Tremble" means to quiver in alarm. "Despond" means disheartened and dejected. When circumstances oppose their desires, their hearts are startled and anxious, fearing they will not attain their ends, and thus fear and dread intermingle. In minor fear, they quiver and tremble; in great fear, they become despondent and disheartened.

Their issuance is like the trigger of a crossbow—this refers to their judgment of right and wrong.
**Exegesis:** "Trigger" is the release mechanism of a crossbow. "Issuance" refers to the arrow’s nock. "Judgment" means to govern. When the mind issues forth to pursue objects, it is as swift as an arrow’s release; when emotions are employed to resist harm, it is as fierce as the crossbow’s trigger. They govern only the judgment of right and wrong, with no other concern.

Their retention is like a sworn oath—this refers to their defense of victory.
**Annotation:** This refers to the difference between movement and stillness.
**Exegesis:** "Sworn" means to invoke. "Oath" means to pledge. When they employ their minds to judge right and wrong, it is like invoking a curse; when they fix their minds on seizing objects, it is no different from pledging an oath. Firmly guarding their resolve, their emotions aim to conquer things.

Their decline is like autumn and winter—this speaks of their daily dissipation.
**Annotation:** Their decay and decline proceed daily like this.
**Exegesis:** In pure autumn, things wither and fall; in dark winter, all is stern and desolate. The scenes of things shift and change as swiftly as the crossing of arms. How could the deluded and confused ever awaken? Only in contending over empty and false right and wrong do they fail to perceive the daily erosion and decay. Human decline and aging follow the same pattern.

What they are submerged in and what they do cannot be made to return.

Their submersion leads only to onward flow—this speaks of such irrevocability.
**Exegesis:** Once mired in objects, their entanglement has long since taken root. What they do strays from the Dao and departs from truth. To seek a return to life’s origin is utterly impossible.

Their weariness is like a sealed bond—this speaks of their aging and drowning.
**Annotation:** Their sinking into desire deepens with age—this is how it proceeds.
**Exegesis:** Weariness means submersion. Like a river flowing backward, they drown in desire, their deluded passions hardening like knotted cords. Not only do they indulge in their prime, but their drowning only worsens with age. The mind near death cannot be restored to vitality.

Their pursuit of profit and neglect of harm, their dark entanglements fulfilling their will—this is how it proceeds.
**Exegesis:** *Mo* means "none." *Yang* means "life." The mind clinging to delusion nears the realm of death; to seek its return to the Way of life is impossible.

Joy and anger, sorrow and delight, anxiety and sighing, change and melancholy, frivolity and indulgence, seduction and affectation—
**Annotation:** These are but variations of human nature.
**Exegesis:** The deluded, in their many forms, cling to what they deem favorable or adverse. Favor brings joy and delight; adversity brings sorrow and anger. Yet sorrow and delight weigh heavier, while joy and anger are lighter. Thus, joy stirs the heart to cautious gladness, while delight moves the body to dance. Anger flares in the moment with resentment, while sorrow wracks the whole being with lament. Anxiety measures what has yet to come; sighing laments what has passed. Change alters what once was; melancholy bends the unbending. Frivolity is light and restless; indulgence is extravagant and unchecked. Seduction opens the floodgates of desire; affectation is coquettish and alluring. The minds of sentient beings shift endlessly, but in brief, these twelve suffice. Examine them closely, and the nature of things becomes clear.

Music emerges from emptiness; mushrooms form in steam.
**Annotation:** These are but variations of natural transformation. The foregoing broadly illustrates the primal patterns of Heaven’s breath; what follows reveals the boundless spontaneity of nature. Each thing arises naturally, unaware of why it is so—yet though forms differ infinitely, their spontaneity is ever the same.
**Exegesis:** The flute’s hollow bore gives rise to refined music; damp heat’s steam breeds morning mushrooms. So too do the ten thousand things of Heaven and Earth, insubstantial and untrue, arise from nothingness into being—like mushrooms, like music. Such fleeting illusions leave no room for joy or anger.

Day and night succeed one another before us, yet none know where they sprout.
**Annotation:** Day and night alternate, each replacing the other with newness. The ten thousand things of Heaven and Earth transform daily, ever renewing, ever advancing with time—what gives rise to them? They simply arise of themselves.
**Exegesis:** Day follows night, night follows day, in ceaseless rotation, each supplanting the other. Yet when we trace their roots, their origin remains unknown.

Enough, enough! From dawn to dusk, we grasp this—yet whence does it arise?
**Annotation:** It arises of itself.
**Exegesis:** *Yi* means "to cease." To trace day and night, to seek what precedes or follows, is futile—better to still the mind. Even if we reexamine dawn and dusk, scrutinize light and dark, their origin remains unfathomable. This reveals that all things in the world are illusory and untrue; to seek the source of life and death is to find only stillness. Thus the *Laozi* says: "Pursue it, and you see not its end; follow it, and you see not its beginning." The principle is just so.

It is neither that the primal other creates me, nor that I receive the primal from any source. This is already near the mark—
**Annotation:** *Bi* means "the natural." The natural gives rise to me; I give rise to the natural. Thus the natural is simply my own spontaneity—how could it be distant?
**Exegesis:** *Bi* means "the natural." *Qu* means "to receive." If not the natural, who could give rise to me? If there were no me, who would receive the natural? Yet I *am* the natural, and the natural *is* me—this principle is not remote, hence "this is already near the mark."

Yet we know not what impels it.
**Annotation:** All things are simply as they are, not impelled by any other—thus to leave them be is to let principle arise of itself.
**Exegesis:** I receive the natural, and its principle is already complete. Walking, grasping, hearing, seeing—each function operates according to its office. They grow and are nourished, yet are not impelled by any other; no need for contrivance, simply let them be.

As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found.
**Annotation:** The ten thousand things and ten thousand passions pursue different paths—it is as if a true master impelled them thus. Yet when we seek this true master’s traces, we find nothing in the end, proving that all things are spontaneous and nothing impels them.
**Exegesis:** The limbs differ, their functions vary—it seems there must be a true nature, yet no master governs. Where do these impulses arise? We may act on our own faith—
**Annotation:** Now, the one who walks trusts that walking is possible.
**Exegesis:** Trusting oneself, acting on inclination, the heavenly mechanism unfolds, moving with one’s nature, self-sufficient and self-sustaining—what need is there for external things?

Yet we see not its form—
**Annotation:** We see not the form that enables walking.
**Exegesis:** All things act on their own trust, yet the appearance of this trust remains unseen.

It has intent but no form.
**Annotation:** Intent aligns with things, yet no separate form is visible.
**Exegesis:** There is the intent to act, yet no form of self-trust.

The hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera are all contained within—
**Annotation:** Entrusted to the natural, none are absent.
**Exegesis:** The hundred bones are the hundred joints. The nine orifices are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, mouth, and the two lower passages.

The six viscera are the six bowels: the large intestine, small intestine, bladder, and triple burner. The *zang* are the five organs: liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. *Gai* means "complete." The bones of the body lie externally, the organs and bowels internally, and the orifices connect inner and outer. These three aspects together constitute the body, hence it is said they are "contained."

Whom should I hold dear?
**Annotation:** They are simply self-contained.
Do you delight in all of them? Is there partiality?
**Annotation:** If you delight in all, then there is partiality. With partiality, they cannot be complete and self-contained. Thus, they are not delighted in yet self-sustaining, not acted upon yet self-generating.
**Exegesis:** The six senses and nine orifices all belong to one body—how could there be closeness or distance, partiality or delight? If there is a mind that delights, then there is partiality. To be partial toward one’s own body is contrary to principle. All are entrusted to their natural placement, each governed by its own office.

Are they all like servants and maidservants?
**Annotation:** If all are treated with partiality, then intentions exceed their proper bounds, and superiors and inferiors encroach upon one another, so that none serve as servants or maidservants. The talents of servants and maidservants, if not content with their roles, are lost.
**Exegesis:** Servants and maidservants are the duties of men and women. Even within a single body, there is the distinction of ruler and subject. For instance, when seeing color, the eyes serve as ruler while the ears serve as subject; when walking, the feet serve as ruler while the hands serve as subject. This arises from the natural principle of Heaven—how could it be merely human contrivance? It is not a matter of intentional closeness or distance that establishes ruler and subject.

**Guo’s Annotation:** Those deemed worthy by the times serve as rulers; those whose talents do not match the age serve as subjects. Governing the state and governing the self are fundamentally the same.

Are the servants and maidservants insufficient to govern one another?
**Annotation:** Servants and maidservants each fulfill their proper roles—this is not insufficient for mutual governance. Mutual governance is like the hands, feet, ears, and eyes, the four limbs and hundred parts, each with its own office yet mutually serving one another.
**Exegesis:** Servants and maidservants, in their service, each have their own duties. For example, the hands grasp and the feet walk—each fulfills its role naturally. How could the hands be insufficient, requiring the feet to walk for them? This is the unfolding of Heaven’s mechanism, acting without intention to govern, yet governing all. The analogy of hands and feet applies to all things.

Do they take turns being ruler and subject?
**Annotation:** Those deemed worthy by the times serve as rulers; those whose talents do not match the age serve as subjects. Just as Heaven is naturally high and Earth naturally low, the head is naturally above and the feet naturally below—how could there be alternation? Though there is no deliberate arrangement, each is naturally fitting.
**Exegesis:** The head is naturally above, the feet naturally below; the eyes can see color, the ears can hear sound. Their functions vary with circumstance, hence there is nobility and baseness. How could one impose preferences of high and low, alternating as ruler and subject? Simply entrust them without intention, and all will be naturally fitting.

Is there a true ruler present?
**Annotation:** When entrusted to their natural state, it is not artificial.
**Exegesis:** When one is utterly unconcerned, without deliberate effort, this is the true ruler, the wondrous Dao, present within. Another interpretation: The true ruler is the true master mentioned earlier. The mind that grasps and rejects, along with colors like blue and yellow, have no inherent nature—they arise from conditional convergence, neither self nor other, neither non-existent nor existent. Thus, the question is posed to clarify that there is no true ruler.

Whether one attains its nature or not, does it harm or benefit its true essence?
**Annotation:** Those who attain their true nature and act according to it, even if they are servants, remain unmoved by praise or blame, content in their station. Thus, whether known or unknown, all remain naturally so. But if one opens the path of ambition, subordinates encroach upon superiors, things lose their truth, and people forget their origin—then praise and blame cause one to falter in confusion.
**Exegesis:** When mind and environment interact, desire and attachment arise. Thus, when one attains what one seeks, it is called a benefit; when one does not, it is called a loss. This is the delusion of the ordinary mind, which clings to gain and loss to disturb the heart. From the perspective of the Dao’s wisdom, there is no harm or benefit to one’s true nature.

Once receiving its completed form, it does not perish until its end.
**Annotation:** Each nature has its allotted portion. Thus, the wise preserve their knowledge until the end, while the foolish cling to their ignorance until death—how could one change their nature midway?
**Exegesis:** Upon receiving one’s form and nature, each has its limits. One cannot turn foolishness into wisdom, nor can one change ugliness into beauty. Thus, once form and nature are complete, they do not perish midway. One can only guard what lies within one’s allotted portion and await the end of one’s natural lifespan.

Engaging with things in mutual conflict and compliance, their actions exhaust themselves like a gallop, yet none can halt them—is this not lamentable?
**Annotation:** The myriad things swarm in confusion, clashing and yielding, each clinging to its partial view and indulging its own conduct, unable to reflect. This is what the multitude finds lamentable—indeed, it is lamentable. Yet the multitude does not regard this as lamentable, for it is the nature of things. Since each thing’s nature is so, what is there to lament?
**Exegesis:** *Ren* means "to oppose," *mi* means "to comply." The myriad things swarm, pursuing their desires and chasing after objects. Since objects have opposition and compliance, the mind clings to right and wrong. Their actions continue year after year, swift as a gallop. Yet they only know to blame external things, never pausing to rest. Measuring the principles of things, this is deeply lamentable.

Spending their lives in toil without seeing their success—
**Annotation:** The passions of things are boundless, and those who know contentment are few. Thus, having attained this, they do not stop but pursue that.

All toil exhaustingly throughout their lives, never sating their aspirations, ceasing only in death. Thus, those who achieve success are rarely seen at any time.

**Exegesis:** The world’s creatures float in competition, and those who know contentment are few. Thus, having attained this, they do not rest but pursue that. So they toil exhaustingly all their lives, consuming their allotted span in remnants, grasping at shadows and chasing the wind—when will their work ever be done? Weary and toiling yet unaware of their destination—how can this not be lamentable?

**Annotation:** All creatures wear out their bodies in pursuit of what they love, until they are sick and weary. Yet they do not know the direction or purpose of this love.

**Exegesis:** *Purán* describes a state of exhaustion. Their passions run deep, laboring mind and spirit, body and soul worn to ruin, weary and distressed. Yet they cling in faith to this competitive pursuit, insisting on their own views, unaware of where they are headed. Such extreme folly is deeply lamentable. If one is said not to die, what benefit is there?

**Annotation:** In truth, this is no different from death.

**Exegesis:** What benefit is there? So mired in delusion, toiling without end, harming their conduct and depleting their spirit—one might as well say their living days are no better than their years of death. When the body transforms, the mind follows suit—can this not be called the greatest sorrow?

**Annotation:** Mind and body race together, exhausted yet never turning back. Compared to what ordinary people lament, this is the true great sorrow. Yet ordinary people never regard this as sorrow, so what they lament is not worth lamenting.

**Exegesis:** *Rán* means "to know this." Thoughts shift moment by moment, ever renewing and flowing away. As the body ages, the mind dims with it, both form and spirit transformed—thus it is said to follow suit. No worldly sorrow surpasses this. Is human life inherently so deluded? Am I alone deluded, or are there others who are not?

**Annotation:** All the above matters arise without knowing why they are so—hence they are called *máng*. Now, those who know do not know how they know yet know spontaneously; those who live do not know how they live yet live spontaneously. Though the myriad things differ, when it comes to living without relying on knowledge, none are different—thus the world is without exception deluded.

**Exegesis:** *Máng* means "confused and obscure." Ordinary people in life are so deluded—all in the world are bewildered, is there even one who is not? Yet Master Zhuang, a true person embodying the Dao, with wisdom clear and penetrating, humbly aligns with the dust of the world—hence he says, "Am I alone deluded?" Guo’s annotation slightly misses the mark; I do not follow it.

If one follows their *chengxin* and takes it as their teacher, who alone would have no teacher?

**Annotation:** The mind sufficient to govern the body’s functions is called *chengxin*. If one takes their own *chengxin* as their teacher, then each person has their own teacher. Since each has their own teacher, entrusting them to it is naturally fitting.

**Exegesis:** Those who cling to partial views, fixated on one school’s biases, are said to have a *chengxin*. Following such a rigid mind and taking it as one’s standard—everyone does this, so who alone would have no teacher?

Why must there be those who know how to replace and whose minds naturally adopt? Even the foolish share in this.

**Annotation:** To replace what is incomplete with what is complete is not knowledge—it is merely the mind’s agreement. Thus, even the foolish take their *chengxin* as their teacher, unwilling to use what they deem deficient and adopt what they deem superior.

**Exegesis:** The foolish and deluded cling stubbornly to right and wrong. How could they ever know the superiority of others’ principles and replace their own shortcomings? They only condemn others as deficient and take themselves as superior. Such people are everywhere, and the foolish are always among them.

To have right and wrong before the mind is formed is like going to Yue today and arriving yesterday.

**Annotation:** If one goes to Yue today, how could one have arrived yesterday? If the mind is not yet formed, how could right and wrong arise?

Those who clarify right and wrong are beyond the reach of the multitude, so the perfected person harmonizes both.

**Exegesis:** The road to Wu and Yue is long—one must travel for days to arrive. If one sets out today, how could one have arrived yesterday? This illustrates that right and wrong between self and others arise from deluded minds. It is said that the mind’s hexagrams have not yet arisen—how could right and wrong exist? Thus, first there is differentiation, then right and wrong; first the road is made, then one arrives in Yue. Therefore, to treat non-being as being—even the divine Yu could not know it, so how could I alone manage?

**Annotation:** There is no principle of right and wrong, yet some take it as existing—this is treating non-being as being. Once the deluded mind is formed, even sages cannot dispel it, so one entrusts it to its natural state without forcing knowledge.

**Exegesis:** Yu, styled Wenming, was the son of Gun and father of Qi. According to the *Yi Fa*: "A spring’s source flowing freely is called *yu*." It also says: "One who receives the mandate and succeeds is called *yu*." To treat the absence of right and wrong as its presence is to treat non-being as being. Once delusion has taken root, the mind is long deceived—even the divine Yu could not make them awaken. Master Zhuang, deeply compassionate in his salvation, could do nothing but entrust it to its natural state, not forcing knowledge.

Words are not like the wind’s blowing. Speakers have words,

**Annotation:** Each has something to say, hence they differ from the wind’s blowing.

**Exegesis:** Both names and words, like the wind’s blowing, are sounds and methods. Yet speakers always have explanations and distinctions—hence it is said they have words.

but what they say is not yet settled.

**Annotation:** I deem it right, while another deems it wrong; what another deems right, I deem wrong—hence it is not settled.

That it is not settled arises from the bias of self and other.

**Exegesis:** Though there are these words, differing from the wind’s blowing, all say "I am right" and "you are wrong."

Since self and other are biased in their sentiments, it alone remains unsettled. Is there truly speech? **Annotation:** Is it deemed that there is speech? Yet it is not sufficient to settle anything. Or was there never speech? **Annotation:** Is it deemed that there was originally no speech? Then, according to oneself, there has already been speech. **Exegesis:** *Guo* means "to determine." This deems it right, that deems it wrong; this deems it wrong, while that deems it right. Since right and wrong are unsettled, what do words explain? Thus, they are not sufficient to be called definite speech. Yet with the bias of self and other, each clings to right and wrong, relying on their own words—hence they cannot be considered originally without speech.

Is it deemed different from the echo in a valley? Does it have distinction, or is it without distinction? **Annotation:** Speech and the echo in a valley share the same essence. Whether there is distinction or no distinction cannot truly be settled. The sentiments of the world are not uniform, and their words cannot differ—thus right and wrong arise in profusion, with no knowing what is settled. **Exegesis:** *Bian* means "distinction." When a chick cries within its shell, it is called the sound of the valley. Speech, too, is encased in its shell. With the bias of self and other, right and wrong unsettled, how is this different from the sound of a valley bird—sound without distinction? Thus, to claim that speech differs from the echo in a valley may not be sufficient to establish distinction.

Where is the Dao hidden that there is truth and falsity? **Exegesis:** *Wu hu* means "in what." The empty, all-pervading Dao is neither true nor false—where could it conceal itself that truth and falsity arise?

Where is speech hidden that there is right and wrong? **Annotation:** The Dao is nowhere absent. Where is speech concealed that truth and falsity, right and wrong, arise in profusion? **Exegesis:** The ultimate teaching, the ultimate speech, is neither right nor wrong—where is it concealed that there is right and wrong?

Where does the Dao go that it does not abide? **Annotation:** It abides everywhere. **Exegesis:** *Cun* means "to be present." The Dao that shapes and nurtures living beings, circulating without cease, is never partial—where is it not present? Thus, it is present in falsity and truth, yet neither true nor false.

Where does speech abide that it is not permissible? **Annotation:** It is permissible everywhere. **Exegesis:** The profound Dao and true speech follow things in their arising and ceasing—where is it impermissible that speech is hidden? Thus, what is permissible and what is not, what is right and what is wrong, are neither right nor wrong.

The Dao is hidden in minor accomplishments. **Exegesis:** *Xiao cheng* refers to benevolence, righteousness, and the five virtues—small paths that have achieved something, hence called minor accomplishments. In this shallow and degenerate age, only benevolence and righteousness are practiced, unable to follow the great Dao—thus it is said the Dao is hidden in minor accomplishments, yet the Dao cannot be hidden.

Speech is hidden in florid ornamentation. **Annotation:** Minor accomplishments and florid ornamentation conceal themselves from the Dao, yet the Dao cannot be concealed. Thus, truth and falsity, right and wrong, operate within florid ornamentation and cease in true appropriateness, appear in minor accomplishments and vanish in great wholeness. **Exegesis:** *Rong hua* refers to superficial eloquence, florid words. Merely clinging to ornate disputation thus obscures the ultimate speech. Hence the *Scripture of Laozi* says, "Trustworthy words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not trustworthy."

Thus, there are the right and wrong of the Confucians and Mohists. **Exegesis:** Long ago, there was a man of Zheng named Huan who studied in the land of Qiu. After three years, his arts were complete, and he transformed into a Confucian. Confucians follow the deluded ways of Yao and Shun, take the regulations of Wen and Wu as their model, practice the Dao of benevolence and righteousness, and distinguish the ranks of noble and base—hence they are called Confucians. Huan’s younger brother was named Di. Huan transformed his brother, and he became a Mohist. Mohists follow the Dao of Yu: esteeming worthiness, revering ritual, frugality with universal love, grinding their heads to their heels to save the common people—hence they are called Mohists. Yet Huan and Di, though brothers by blood, each clung to one teaching and mutually affirmed and denied. Huan resented his brother and died in a fit of indignation. Thus, the right and wrong of self and other have existed for a long time. The severity of their contention arose from these two worthies—hence they are pointed to as the leaders of the disorderly multitude.

This is how the Dao is lost and speech hidden, and only then do right and wrong supervise. Affirm what they deny and deny what they affirm. **Annotation:** Confucians and Mohists mutually affirm and deny, yet the world is all Confucians and Mohists. Thus, the hundred schools arise, each prizing their own views, never having departed from their own bounds. **Exegesis:** There is none in the world who does not deem themselves right and others wrong. Others likewise deem you wrong and themselves right. Thus, each uses their own right to affirm others’ wrong, and their own wrong to deny others’ right. If you wish to affirm what they deny and deny what they affirm, then nothing is better than illumination.

**Annotation:** Those who have right and wrong are what the Confucians and Mohists affirm; those who are without right and without wrong are what the Confucians and Mohists deny. Now, to affirm what the Confucians and Mohists deny and deny what they affirm is to desire to illuminate the absence of right and wrong. To illuminate the absence of right and wrong, nothing is better than using the Confucians and Mohists to mutually illuminate one another in reversal. Mutually illuminating in reversal, what they affirm is not right, and what they deny is not wrong. Not wrong is the absence of wrong; not right is the absence of right. **Exegesis:** The world all deems others wrong and themselves right. Now, to reverse wrong into right and right into wrong, one must return to using self and other, mutually illuminating in reversal. Mutually illuminating in reversal, what they deny is not wrong—thus the absence of wrong; what they affirm is not right—thus the absence of right. The absence of right is the absence of wrong—hence one knows that right and wrong are both illusory.

Things are not wrong in themselves; things are not right in themselves. **Annotation:** All things deem themselves right—hence they are not right; all things deem others wrong—hence they are not wrong. Not wrong, then the world is without right; not right, then the world is without wrong.

The absence of other is the absence of self; this is how they merge in mystery.
**Exegesis:** As the annotation states, "All things deem themselves right—hence the absence of right; all things deem others wrong—hence the absence of wrong." The absence of wrong means the world is without right; the absence of right means the world is without wrong. The absence of other and the absence of self—this is how they merge in mystery. This annotation exhausts the principle; no further explication is needed.

To see from the perspective of other is not to see; to know from one’s own perspective is to know.
**Exegesis:** When one is deemed "other" by another, one does not see oneself; when one knows oneself to be right, one knows it. All things are partial in this way. If one could truly see others as seeing oneself, then there would be neither right nor wrong. Thus it is said: "Other arises from self; self also depends on other."
**Annotation:** In their partiality, all things fail to see what others see and only know what they themselves know. Knowing only what they know, they deem themselves right. Deeming themselves right, they deem others wrong. Thus it is said: "Other arises from self; self also depends on other"—other and self arise in mutual dependence.
**Exegesis:** Other is opposed to self; right depends on wrong—this is the great principle of literary composition. Here, to say "other arises from self" is to speak subtly of principle, taking the perspective of other to illustrate the point. It shows that by grasping other, one clarifies self; by grasping right, one clarifies wrong. Yet other and self, right and wrong, arise in mutual dependence. When one seeks to analyze them, their very essence is found to be empty. This is the doctrine of the simultaneous arising of other and self. Yet even as they arise, they perish; even as they perish, they arise. Even as right arises, wrong arises; even as wrong arises, right arises. Thus right depends on wrong, and wrong depends on right.
**Annotation:** The transformations of life and death are like the progression of the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer. Though the states of life and death differ, each finds peace in its own condition. Now, the living deem life as life, while the dead deem life as death—thus there is no true life. The living deem death as death, while the dead deem death as life—thus there is no true death. Without life or death, without right or wrong, how can the debates of Confucians and Mohists be reconciled? Yet when each abides in its own nature, even I cannot dissent.
**Exegesis:** "Even as" means "just as." The mutual arising of other and self is no different from the doctrine of life and death. Life and death alternate like the succession of cold and heat. The living take life as life, while the dead take life as death—just as those who affirm right take right as right, while those who deny it take right as wrong. Thus, to depend on right is to generate wrong; to depend on wrong is to generate right. If one depends on wrong to generate right, then there is no right; if one depends on right to generate wrong, then there is no wrong. Thus, without right or wrong, without life or death, without affirmation or denial—what debate remains between other and self? Therefore, the sage does not follow this path but submits to Heaven, relying on what is so.
**Annotation:** One who embraces openness follows the world’s right and wrong yet remains free of right and wrong. Not following the path of right and wrong, yet without harm or misalignment, is simply to illuminate the natural and be unconstrained by it.
**Exegesis:** "Heaven" is the natural. The sage, in profound awakening, does not pursue right or avoid wrong but abides in emptiness and stillness, illumined by the wisdom of the natural. Through this right and wrong, one attains the absence of wrong and the absence of right, never forcing existence to prove emptiness. Self is also other.
**Annotation:** I, too, am deemed "other" by others.
Other is also self.
**Annotation:** Others, too, deem themselves right.
**Exegesis:** When I deem myself right, I am deemed wrong by others. When I deem others wrong, they deem themselves right. Other, too, has its right and wrong; self, too, has its right and wrong.
**Annotation:** Self deems itself right and others wrong; others deem themselves right and self wrong. Each has its own right and wrong within its own perspective.
**Exegesis:** Self deems itself right, and others deem themselves right; self deems others wrong, and others deem self wrong. Thus, each has its own right and its own wrong. Is there truly other and self? Is there truly no other and self?
**Annotation:** If one seeks to define other as other, other deems itself right. If one seeks to define right as right, right is deemed wrong by others. Thus, the question of their existence or non-existence remains unresolved.
**Exegesis:** Other and self, right and wrong, stand in mutual dependence. When one examines them closely, their very essence is found to be empty. To deem oneself right is not without basis; to be deemed wrong by others is not without reason. The existence or non-existence of other and self cannot be definitively settled. When other and self find no counterpart, this is called the pivot of the Dao.
**Annotation:** "Counterpart" means opposition. Other and self oppose each other, yet the sage harmonizes both. Thus, one without attachment merges with things and never opposes the world. "Pivot" means essential. To dwell in this essential pivot and unite with the profound ultimate is to respond to the boundless.
**Exegesis:** "Counterpart" means opposition; "pivot" means essential. To realize that other and self are both empty, that right and wrong are both illusory, and to concentrate the spirit in solitary insight without opposing the world—this is to unite with the profound ultimate and grasp the essential pivot of the Dao. Earlier, a hypothetical question was posed about existence and non-existence, their affirmation and negation unresolved. Here, the mutual dependence of other and self is reaffirmed, revealing their inherent emptiness. The earlier passage was shallow; this one is profound—hence their sequence. Once the pivot is grasped within the ring, it can respond endlessly.
**Annotation:** Right and wrong alternate endlessly, forming a ring. The center of the ring is empty. To grasp the center of this ring of right and wrong is to be without right and without wrong. Without right and without wrong, one can respond to right and wrong. Since right and wrong are endless, the response is also endless.

**Commentary:**
To be without dependence and transform alone—this is the root and origin of the Dao, the essential pivot of learning, hence called the "pivot." The "ring" is provisionally posited as having two openings; the "center" is the true emptiness of the one Way. The ring’s center is empty, thus illuminating the absence of right and wrong. Since right and wrong are endless, the response is likewise endless. Right is one infinity, wrong is another infinity.

**Annotation:**
In the world, none do not deem themselves right and none do not oppose others, thus right and wrong proceed in parallel without end. Only one who enters emptiness and attains the center remains unbound, riding it to wander freely.

**Commentary:**
Of things, none do not deem themselves right—thus right is one infinity; none do not oppose others—thus wrong is one infinity. Only one who forgets both self and other, relinquishes both right and wrong, and grasps the Way within the ring can thereby accord with all beings and ride it to wander. Hence it is said, "None is better than to illumine." To use a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. To use a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse.

**Commentary:**
A "finger" is a digit of the hand. A "horse" refers to a gaming piece. "Illustrate" means to compare. It speaks of how people cling to right and wrong, their perspectives differing. Thus, using one’s own finger to compare with another’s finger makes the other’s finger a non-finger; then using the other’s finger to compare with yours makes your finger a non-finger in relation to theirs. The same applies to horses. The reason the finger is singled out among all dharmas is to show that nothing is closer to the body or more essential than the finger, while nothing in distant comparisons precedes the horse in determining victory or defeat. Thus, these two examples are used to analogize right and wrong. Heaven and earth are one finger; the ten thousand things are one horse.

**Annotation:**
To deem oneself right and others wrong is the common tendency of self and other. Thus, using my finger to illustrate another’s finger makes the other’s finger uniquely a non-finger in relation to mine—this is using a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. If, in turn, the other’s finger is used to illustrate my finger, then my finger becomes a non-finger in relation to theirs—this is using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. To clarify the absence of right and wrong, nothing is better than reciprocal illustration. Through reciprocal illustration, self and other are alike in deeming themselves right and alike in opposing each other. Being alike in opposition, the world has no right; being alike in self-affirmation, the world has no wrong. How can this be demonstrated? If right were truly right, the world would have no one to deem it wrong. If wrong were truly wrong, it would have no one to deem it right. Yet now, right and wrong have no fixed ground, swirling in chaotic confusion—this makes clear that these petty views each trust their own bias and converge in uniformity. Look up or down, and none are otherwise. Thus, the perfected person knows that heaven and earth are one finger, the ten thousand things are one horse. Therefore, they abide in vast tranquility, and heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things each fulfill their place, united in self-attainment, without right and without wrong.

**Commentary:**
Though heaven and earth are vast, one finger can encompass them; though the ten thousand things are numerous, one horse can govern them all. How is this known? Now, through reciprocal illustration of self and other’s right and wrong, what is deemed right is not right, and what is deemed wrong is not wrong. Thus, the two modes and the ten thousand things are without right and without wrong.

What is right is right.
**Annotation:** What is right to oneself is called right.

What is wrong is wrong.
**Annotation:** What is wrong to oneself is called wrong.

**Commentary:** Principle has no right or wrong, yet things have compliance and opposition. Thus, what accords with one’s intent is called right, and what contradicts one’s feelings is called wrong. Since compliance and opposition are empty, it is known that right and wrong are both delusory.

The Way is enacted and thereby completed.
**Annotation:** There is nothing it does not complete.

**Commentary:** The great Dao is vast and nurturing, pervading all beings—nothing it does not bring to fulfillment. Thus, in what is right, it completes the right without being confined to right; in what is wrong, it completes the wrong without being confined to wrong.

Things deem it so and thus it is so.
**Annotation:** There is nothing it does not deem so.

**Commentary:** The sentiments of beings are inverted, not comprehending compliance and opposition, vainly calculating right and wrong, falsely asserting what is so and what is not.

How is it so? It is so in being so.

How is it not so? It is not so in being not so.
**Commentary:** When mind and realm are both empty, self and other are doubly illusory—where then can there be a "so" to cling to as so? Where can there be a "not so" to cling to as not so?

Things invariably have what they deem so.
Things invariably have what they deem right.
**Annotation:** Each deems so what it deems so; each deems right what it deems right.
**Commentary:** Sentiments of beings, clinging and stagnant, delude at every encounter. They invariably insist on what is so, invariably insist on what is right—how could they know that what is right is also wrong, what is so is also not so?

Nothing is not so; nothing is not right.
**Commentary:** All beings, in their myriad affirmations, deem right what they see. Each deems so what it deems so; each deems right what it deems right. Thus are adduced the crossbeam and the pillar, the leper and Xi Shi, the vast and the strange, the cunning and the monstrous—all are pervaded by the Dao and united as one.
**Annotation:** The mat lies horizontally while the pillar stands vertically; the leper is ugly while Xi Shi is beautiful. What is meant by "uniting as one" is not that forms must be identical or rules the same. Thus, whether vertical or horizontal, beautiful or ugly, vast or strange, cunning or monstrous—each deems so what it deems so, each deems right what it deems right. Though principles may differ in ten thousand ways, their nature is the same in attainment. Hence it is said: the Dao pervades and unites as one.
**Commentary:** To illustrate this principle, eight examples are briefly adduced. The *yan* is the roof beam; the *ying* is the house pillar. *Li* refers to a person disfigured by illness; Xi Shi was the beautiful concubine of the King of Wu. *Hui* denotes vastness; *gui* denotes the strange and wondrous. *Ju* signifies deceitful intent; *guai* signifies monstrous things. Though vertical and horizontal, beauty and ugliness appear to differ in ten thousand ways, worldly sentiments incline toward partiality. Thus, right and wrong, so and not so arise, and beings become deludedly attached to distinctions. Yet when viewed through the mysterious Dao, all are fundamentally non-dual. Though the appearances of beauty and ugliness differ in ten thousand ways, the nature of self-attainment is one. Hence it is said: the Dao pervades and unites as one.

What divides them constitutes their completion;
**Annotation:** What one deems dispersal, another deems completion.
**Commentary:** What is dispersal to one may be completion to another, illustrating that gathering and scattering are not fixed. This further elucidates the principle of non-duality.

What completes them constitutes their destruction.
**Annotation:** What I deem completion, another may deem destruction.
**Commentary:** What is completion to one may be destruction to another. The application of things varies thus—like scattering wool to make felt or felling trees to build a house.

All things are neither completion nor destruction, yet again are pervaded and united as one.
**Annotation:** Completion and destruction arise from seeing only oneself and not the other. Thus, there is neither completion nor destruction, just as there is neither right nor wrong.
**Commentary:** Completion and destruction, right and wrong arise from partiality and stagnation. Since completion and destruction are not fixed, and right and wrong have no basis, there is neither completion nor destruction—they are pervaded and united as one.

Only the attuned know this unity, and thus do not employ it but entrust it to the ordinary.
**Commentary:** *Yu* means to lodge; *yong* means to employ. Only those who have attained the Dao, concentrating their spirit in profound insight, can abandon dualistic partiality and unite all as one. For this reason, they accomplish without claiming, employ while forgetting employment, and entrust their use to the myriad talents.
Ordinary means employment; employment means pervasion; pervasion means attainment;
**Annotation:** The attuned are not stagnant in any one direction, thus they spontaneously forget themselves and entrust their use to what is fitting. In self-employment, all things flow unimpeded and attain their nature.
**Commentary:** Those who achieve great deeds yet attribute success to others, who govern the multitudes yet entrust their use to the people—are they not sages? Thus, they respond without intention, their spirit pervading without stagnation. This may be called embodying the true and attaining the Dao, grasping the dark pearl at the Red Waters.

To attain thus is to be near perfection.
**Annotation:** *Ji* means exhaustion. The ultimate principle is exhausted in self-attainment.
**Commentary:** *Ji* means exhaustion. In attainment, one does not rely on self within nor on things without, acting without thought or effort, transcending learning and dependence. Attaining thus, without cause, in accord with principle, one exhausts the mystery.

Proceed from this.
**Annotation:** The attuned proceed without contrivance.
**Commentary:** The attuned act without intention, thus they proceed through right and wrong without right and wrong, follow self and other without self and other. They merely follow—how could they impose their sentiments?

Proceeding thus without knowing why it is so is called the Dao.
**Annotation:** In proceeding thus, do the attuned know they proceed well and thus proceed? They do not know why they proceed and yet proceed spontaneously—hence it is called the Dao.
**Commentary:** *Yi’er* is a phrase connecting prior and subsequent. The perfected are without intention; they respond when stimulated, like a bright mirror or an empty valley, following the myriad things and echoing the multitudes. They do not know why it is so, nor why they respond—how could they harbor sentiments of approval or disapproval, or be bound by profit and harm? To model oneself after others may be called the natural Dao.

To exhaust spirit and intelligence in unifying, yet not know their sameness,
**Commentary:** The mysterious Dao is wondrously one, ever profoundly thus—not through calculation or deliberation does it become non-dual. Yet the foolish exhaust their spirit and intelligence, engaging in chance debates to seek unity. This is no different from those who know neither unity nor non-unity—it is not worthy of emulation. Not knowing the ultimate principle, which is inherently undivided, how could one need to apply the mind to be called non-dual?

is called "morning three."
**Commentary:** This introduces a parable. What is "morning three"? The keeper of monkeys distributed chestnuts, saying: "Three in the morning and four in the evening." The monkeys were all enraged. He then said: "Then four in the morning and three in the evening." The monkeys were all pleased.

Though names and realities remain unaltered, joy and anger arise as their function—this is the same principle.
**Commentary:** For one who has attained understanding, how could unity require the labor of spirit? If one exhausts spiritual clarity in pursuit of unity, it is not to be relied upon, and differs not from those who fail to attain unity. This is no different from the monkeys’ delusion, where they take their preferences as self-evident truth.

**Commentary:** This explains the parable. *Ju* (狙) refers to the macaque monkey. *Fu* (赋) means to distribute. *Yu* (芋) are acorns, resembling chestnuts but smaller. The *Liezi* states: In Song there was an old man who kept monkeys and understood their minds. He teased them, saying: "I will give you five *wei* of acorns—three in the morning and four in the evening. Is that enough?" The monkeys all rose in anger. He then said: "Then I will give you four in the morning and three in the evening. Is that enough?" The monkeys all prostrated themselves in delight. Whether three in the morning and four in the evening, or four in the morning and three in the evening, the total of seven remains the same. The name is unchanged, and the reality suffers no loss, yet one brings joy and the other anger—such is the function of foolish delusion. This, too, is to follow one’s preferences and take them as self-evident truth. It is no different from those who exhaust their minds in debate, adorn their words to force the myriad things into unity, and claim to have attained oneness—how does this differ from the monkeys’ delusion?

Thus the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the equilibrium of Heaven.
**Commentary:** Without leaning toward any one side, he entrusts it to its own balance and ceases.
**Commentary:** *Tian jun* (天均) refers to the principle of natural equilibrium. The sage who has attained the Dao remains empty and ungrasping, thus able to harmonize right with no-right and wrong with no-wrong. He stills his intellect in the realm of balance and rests his mind in the境 of spontaneity. This is called "walking the two paths."
**Commentary:** Following the right and wrong of the world.
**Commentary:** Without departing from right and wrong, he attains non-right and non-wrong—thus it is called "walking the two paths."

*End of the Second Scroll of the Zhuangzi: Annotated and Explained*

The Tang dynasty Master of Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying, annotates:

The ancients—their knowledge had a point of attainment.
**Annotation:** *Zhi* (至) means "to reach the ultimate." The pure and ancient sages employed their wisdom with emptiness and subtlety. Though they blended their light with the common world, their wisdom was as if non-knowing; their movements did not depart from stillness, ever abiding in the wondrous root. The meaning of "attainment" is expounded below.

Wherein did they attain?
**Annotation:** A hypothetical question: in what did they reach the ultimate?

There were those who held that "never yet had there been things"—this was the ultimate, the utmost, beyond which nothing could be added.
**Note:** This is to forget Heaven and Earth, to leave behind the myriad things, outwardly not examining the cosmos, inwardly not perceiving one’s own body. Thus one is vast and unburdened, moving together with things without fail, responding to all without exception.
**Annotation:** *Weishi* (未始) means "never yet." All dharmas in the world are utterly non-existent; both things and the self, inner and outer, are all empty. The four propositions are all negated, leaving only vast stillness. The principle is exhausted here, and nothing more can be added. This answers the earlier question, clarifying the meaning of the ultimate.

Next were those who held that "there were things, yet never yet had there been boundaries."
**Note:** Though they had not entirely forgotten, they were still able to forget "that" and "this."
**Annotation:** The great worthies in the initial stages of learning, nearing the sagely realm, though they perceived the distinction between emptiness and existence, had never yet fixed or clung to it.

Next were those who held that "there were boundaries, yet never yet had there been right and wrong."
**Note:** Though they had not yet forgotten "that" and "this," they were still able to forget the right and wrong of "that" and "this."
**Annotation:** The passions of desire are hard to remove, and attachment to things has already taken hold; yet the delusion of distinction is easily dispelled, and the perception of right and wrong is still forgotten.

The manifestation of right and wrong is the reason the Dao is diminished.
**Note:** Only without right and wrong is it whole.
**Annotation:** To assert "this is not" or "that is right" is the vulgar sentiment of the common world; to be without right and without wrong is the penetrating insight of the enlightened. Thus, when "that" and "I" are made manifest, the supreme Dao is concealed; when right and wrong cease, the wondrous principle is complete. The reason the Dao is diminished is the reason love is formed.
**Note:** When the Dao is diminished, emotions become partial and love takes shape. One has not yet forgotten love or relinquished self-interest to merge with "that" and "this" in mystery.
**Annotation:** When the empty and wondrous Dao is thus diminished, the passions of attachment and defilement thereby take form.

Is there truly completion and diminution? Is there truly no completion and no diminution?
**Note:** Whether it is "there is" or "there is not," one cannot know—this is the utmost.
**Annotation:** *Guo* (果) means "to determine." The Dao is neither increased nor decreased, but things have completion and diminution. Thus, when the love of things is formed, one deems the Dao diminished, yet the Dao is in truth without diminution. Therefore, this hypothetical discussion clarifies the meaning. Since "there is" and "there is not" cannot be determined, the principle of completion and diminution is not a true record.

There is completion and diminution—thus Master Zhao’s playing of the zither. There is no completion and no diminution—thus Master Zhao’s not playing the zither.
**Note:** Sounds cannot all be produced. Though one blows pipes or plucks strings with intricate skill, many sounds are still left unplayed. Those who grasp the flute or strike the strings seek to manifest sound, yet in manifesting sound, sound is lost; in not manifesting sound, sound is complete. Thus, to seek completion and thereby diminish it is Master Zhao’s playing of the zither; not to seek completion and thus remain without diminution is Master Zhao’s not playing the zither.
**Annotation:** His surname was Zhao, his given name Wen—an ancient master of the zither. Though Master Zhao’s playing was skillful, when he played the *shang* note, the *jiao* was lost; when he struck the *gong*, the *zhi* was missed. It was not as good as setting the zither aside and not playing, for then the five notes would be naturally complete. This is like how having completion and diminution, preserving emotions, leads one astray from the Dao; having no completion and no diminution, forgetting wisdom, aligns one with the real. Master Zhao’s playing of the zither, Shi Kuang’s striking of the baton, and Master Hui’s leaning on the catalpa—these three men’s knowledge was nearly exhausted.
**Note:** *Ji* (几) means "exhausted." These three men all sought to debate what they themselves did not understand in order to clarify it. Thus their knowledge was exhausted, their thoughts depleted, their forms wearied, their spirits fatigued—sometimes striking the baton and dozing, sometimes leaning on the catalpa and closing their eyes.
**Annotation:** Shi Kuang, styled Ziye, was the music master of Duke Ping of Jin, deeply versed in musical principles. *Zhi* (枝) means "to prop"; *ce* (策) refers to the baton used to strike the drum. It may also mean the branch used to keep time. The catalpa was a zither; this interpretation is unlikely. Master Zhao was already skilled at playing the zither—how could two others share the same instrument? Moreover, consulting the classics, there is no record of Master Hui being skilled at the zither. Thus, "leaning on the catalpa" simply means resting on a catalpa table while discoursing, like one who leans on a table. *Ji* (几) means "exhausted." Master Zhao was skilled at playing the zither, Shi Kuang was wondrously versed in musical principles, and Hui Shi was fond of debating names and principles. The natures of these three men were endowed by Heaven, each using their own abilities to demonstrate to the world. Yet the world did not awaken, and they themselves grew weary, leading them to prop the baton and doze, or lean on the table and close their eyes. The abilities of these three were exhausted here. All were in their prime, which is why they are recorded in their later years.
**Note:** It was because they were in their prime that they endured; otherwise, they would have been exhausted long before.
**Annotation:** Hui Shi and his like were all in the vigor of youth, thus able to sustain their forms and intellects. In their declining later years, their right and wrong diminished in intensity, and they would eventually face hardship.

Was it only their fondness for these things that set them apart from others?
**Note:** These three men were not fond of what they themselves understood, yet they considered themselves distinct from the multitude.
**Annotation:** Each of the three men indulged in what they were fond of, seeking to flaunt their abilities and stand apart from others.

Their fondness for these things was to make them known.
**Note:** To make them manifest to others, desiring that all share in what they themselves were fond of.
**Annotation:** The reason they wearied their forms and spirits with unceasing fondness was to propagate their own ways and make them known to the multitude.

They illuminated what they did not understand, thus ending in the obscurity of "hardness and whiteness." **Annotation:** This is like playing the zither to an ox. Since others ultimately did not comprehend, their own Way remained veiled in darkness.

**Annotation:** "They" refers to the multitude. "What they understood" refers to the propagation of the Way. "Whiteness" alludes to Gongsun Long’s *Discourse on the White Horse*. Gongsun, surnamed Long, was a man of Zhao. During the Warring States period, his disciples, such as Kong Chuan, rigidly upheld this doctrine, traversing the world and silencing the mouths—but not the hearts—of the people. Things are endowed with different natures, and each follows its own preferences. Thus, the Ways of the three men differed, and the multitude could not comprehend them. To forcibly display what is not understood only deepens mutual obscurity. How is this different from stubbornly clinging to the *Discourse on the White Horse*, confounding the world with sophistry? Though their eloquence flowed like a river, in the end, their words lacked principle.

Moreover, their sons exhausted themselves in weaving the threads of their fathers’ work, yet accomplished nothing in their lifetimes. **Annotation:** The son of Zhaowen continued his father’s legacy but ultimately failed to achieve it.

**Annotation:** "Threads" refers to the continuation of a lineage. Zhaowen’s son inherited his father’s vocation, pursuing its threads to the end of his days, yet achieved nothing. How much less could others be expected to succeed? If this can be called accomplishment, then even I have accomplished something.

These three masters sought clarity from others, yet those others remained unenlightened—thus they accomplished nothing in their lifetimes. If their efforts could be called accomplishment, then even my own lack of accomplishment could be called accomplishment.

**Annotation:** "I" refers to the multitude. If these three masters, distinct from the multitude, deemed themselves accomplished, then the multitude, distinct from them, could likewise be called accomplished. If this cannot be called accomplishment, then neither things nor I have accomplished anything.

**Annotation:** All things seek to clarify themselves rather than others. If failure to enlighten others is deemed lack of accomplishment, then all things are equally without accomplishment. Thus, the sage does not display this to dazzle that, nor cling to the self while pursuing externals. Following and yielding to each, allowing all to fulfill their capacities, he bends to accommodate without omission.

Now, these three masters sought to impose their preferences upon others—was this not delusion?

**Exegesis:** If these three masters and all things are not to be called accomplished, then the multitude and these three masters are equally without accomplishment. Thus, the dazzling confusion of sophistry is what the sage guards against. Instead, he sets it aside and lodges it in the commonplace—this is called "illumination through obscurity."

**Annotation:** The sage is without self. Thus, when faced with dazzling confusion, he restrains and contains it; when confronted with extravagance, absurdity, or monstrosity, he unifies and harmonizes them. He allows all differences to settle where they belong, ensuring the multitude does not lose what they affirm. Thus, he does not impose upon things, yet all things fulfill their functions. When all things act according to their nature, who can say what is right or wrong? Therefore, even in the face of boundless change or the most peculiar deviations, he bends to follow them, entrusting each to its own use. Though their functions may differ a thousandfold, clarity emerges of itself.

**Exegesis:** The sage’s virtue merges with heaven and earth, his illumination matches the sun and moon. Thus, he conceals his brilliance like the hidden paths of the earth, veils his light in dealings with others, never dazzling the multitude or confusing the world. Nor does he exalt himself to lead others, but instead sets boundaries within their proper spheres, embracing the great harmony of all things. He entrusts himself to the talents of the many, and in this way of thinking, true sagely wisdom is revealed.

Now, let us consider these words: Do they belong to this category or not? Whether they belong or not, if they are deemed akin to this category, they differ not from that.

**Annotation:** If we claim that words are without right or wrong, how can we know whether they resemble those that assert right and wrong or not? If we call them akin, then I regard "without" as right, while they regard "without" as wrong—this is not akin. Yet though their right and wrong differ, they are still bound to the existence of right and wrong, and thus akin to them. Therefore, it is said that "akin and not akin are themselves akin," differing not from that. If one wishes to avoid such dissimilarity entirely, nothing surpasses being without mind—having abandoned right and wrong, one must then abandon even that abandonment. Abandoning again and again until there is no abandonment left, then there is no abandonment and no non-abandonment, and right and wrong vanish of themselves.

**Exegesis:** "Category" refers to groups of similar kind. Yet the multitude, deluded and attached, clings to right and wrong. This discourse seeks to overturn worldly sentiments and shatter such attachments, provisionally asserting the absence of right and wrong as the true Way. Thus, it speaks of "being akin," which is the abandonment of "without right and without wrong." Having abandoned it, one must abandon it again, reaching the profound mystery.

Nevertheless, let us attempt to speak of it.

**Annotation:** The ultimate principle is wordless; to speak is to become akin to categories. Thus, we provisionally lodge it in words.

**Exegesis:** To attempt is to test. The ultimate principle is difficult to recover without words, yet without words, there is no means to expound it. Thus, we provisionally lodge it in words, approximating its meaning.

Suppose there is a beginning.

**Annotation:** Where there is a beginning, there is an end.

**Exegesis:** This is a hypothetical question to illustrate that the ultimate Way is without beginning or end—this is the abandonment of beginning and end.

Suppose there is a time before the beginning.

**Annotation:** This refers to the absence of end and beginning, the unity of life and death.

**Exegesis:** "Before the beginning" means "not yet having begun." This is another hypothetical question: Is there a time before the beginning and end? This is the abandonment of "without beginning or end."

Suppose there is a time before that which is before the beginning.

**Annotation:** To unify is not as good as not unifying and letting things align of themselves—this is the forgetting of unity.

**Exegesis:** This is yet another hypothetical question: Is there a time before that which is before the beginning? This is the abandonment of "without beginning or end."

Suppose there is being.

**Annotation:** Where there is being, beauty and ugliness, right and wrong all exist.

**Exegesis:** All the myriad phenomena are illusory and empty. Thus, this "being" is posited to clarify that being is itself emptiness—this sentence abandons being.

Suppose there is non-being.

**Annotation:** Where there is being and non-being, yet the absence of absence is not known, then right and wrong, love and hate still linger in the heart.

**Exegesis:** This is a hypothetical question: Is there this non-being or not? Here, it is shown that not only is being not truly being, but non-being is not truly non-being—this sentence abandons non-being.

Suppose there is a time before non-being.

**Annotation:** Knowing the absence of absence, yet still unable to be without knowledge.

**Exegesis:** This is a hypothetical question: Is there a time before non-being? This sentence abandons "not."

Suppose there is a time before that which is before non-being.

**Exegesis:** This is a hypothetical question: Is there a time before that which is before non-being? This sentence abandons "not-not-non-being."

Thus, from the shallow to the profound, from the manifest to the subtle, beginning with being and ending with "not-not-non-being," we see that all the hundred negations are transcended, the four propositions surpassed—clarity is achieved. The earlier discussion of beginning and end pertains to time; this discussion of being and non-being pertains to dharma. Only time and dharma, both empty and still, are considered.

Suddenly, there is being and non-being, yet we do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly real.

**Commentary:** Here, all knowing is utterly forgotten—only then does one suddenly begin to comprehend "nothingness." When "nothingness" is comprehended, heaven and earth, the myriad things, self and other, right and wrong—all become luminously certain.

**Exegesis:** The paths of being and non-being from before and after enter into the root of "not-not-being-and-non-being." Now, from the substance of "not-not-being-and-non-being," the function of being and non-being emerges. As for the word "suddenly," it clarifies that substance and function are inseparable—within this sudden moment, there is no distant separation. The profound Dao is dark and obscure; the true source is subtle and wondrous. Thus, when function arises suddenly, it is not being-and-non-being yet manifests as being-and-non-being; when substance is realized through function, being-and-non-being are no longer being-and-non-being. Therefore, being and non-being are not fixed; substance and function have no constancy. Who can definitively determine non-being? Who can definitively determine being? This further elucidates the substance beyond being-and-non-being through the function of being-and-non-being.

Now, I have already spoken—
**Commentary:** To say there is no right or wrong is itself a form of speaking.

—but I do not know whether what I have spoken is truly speaking or truly not speaking.
**Commentary:** Nor do I know whether this speaking is being or non-being—only then is the mind utterly free of the slightest dust.

**Exegesis:** "Speaking" refers to words. Zhuangzi again speaks of "no words." Principle emerges from teachings that employ words—this is like the earlier request to "try speaking." Since words are employed to expound principle, one does not know whether these words are definitively speaking or definitively not speaking. This is to clarify that the family of principle is neither silent nor speaking, and teaching is neither non-being nor being. Fearing that scholars might cling to words, he thus expresses this.

Is there anything in the world greater than the tip of an autumn hair? Yet Mount Tai is small. Is there anything longer-lived than a child who dies young? Yet Pengzu is short-lived. Heaven and earth are born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one.
**Commentary:** When forms are compared, Mount Tai is greater than an autumn hair. But if each abides in its own nature and things reach their ultimate, then great form is not excessive, and small form is not deficient. If each is sufficient in its nature, then an autumn hair is not merely small in its smallness, nor is Mount Tai merely great in its greatness. If sufficiency of nature is considered great, then nothing in the world is greater than an autumn hair. If sufficiency of nature is not great, then even Mount Tai may be called small. Thus it is said: "Is there anything in the world greater than the tip of an autumn hair? Yet Mount Tai is small." If Mount Tai is small, then nothing in the world is great; if an autumn hair is great, then nothing in the world is small. Without small or great, without long-lived or short-lived, the cricket does not envy the great tree but delights in itself, and the marsh pheasant does not prize the celestial pond but finds contentment in what suffices. If one is sufficient in Heaven’s spontaneity and at peace in one’s nature and destiny, then even heaven and earth are not long-lived enough to be considered separate from me, and the myriad things are not different enough to be considered distinct from me. If heaven and earth are born, how could they not be born together with me? If the myriad things attain, how could they not attain as one with me?

**Exegesis:** In autumn, animals grow fine hairs, the tips of which are exceedingly minute—hence "the tip of an autumn hair." A child who dies in infancy is called a "child who dies young." *Tai* means great. As for the arising of things, their forms and qi differ—some are small, some great, some short-lived, some long-lived. Yet if one speaks in terms of their nature, none is not self-sufficient. Thus, if nature is considered great, nothing in the world is greater than the tip of a hair; if excess is considered small, nothing in the world is smaller than Mount Tai. If Mount Tai is small, then nothing in the world is great; if the tip of a hair is great, then nothing in the world is small. Since small and great are thus, so too are short-lived and long-lived. Therefore, though the Two Modes are vast, the nature of each suffices equally; though the myriad things are many, the principle of self-attainment is one. Earlier, it was shown that there is no end or beginning, no being or non-being...

This clarifies that there is neither small nor great, neither short-lived nor long-lived. Having already become one, can there yet be speech?

**[Annotation]** The myriad things and myriad forms are alike in their self-attainment; their attainment is one. Having already become one, in principle there is nothing to be said.

Having already called it one, can there yet be no speech?

**[Annotation]** Names and terms arise from what is not understood. Some things cannot themselves clarify their oneness and thus pursue others with these terms, so they call it "one" to correct them. Once it is called "one," this is already speech.

**[Exegesis]** The mysterious Dao is dark and silent, its principle transcending form and sound. To guide those lost on the path, terms and names arise. Thus, though the One is the profound origin, it remains within the realm of names and teachings. Having called it "one," how can one say there is no speech? The One and speech make two; two and the One make three. From this point onward, even the most skillful reckoner cannot grasp it—how much less the ordinary person?

**[Annotation]** To speak of the One with speech, yet the One is not speech, thus the One and speech make two. The One is already one, and speech further divides it into two. Having one and having two, can this not be called three? To speak of it with a single word still results in three; how much more when tracing its branches and streams, where things have distinct names? Even with good reckoning, none can record it. Thus, those who speak of the One have not yet departed from the other, while those who forget the One are without speech yet naturally one.

**[Exegesis]** The principle of the wondrous One is beyond speech; thus, to speak of the One with speech is to have the One not be speech. Moreover, the One is already one, and speech further speaks of it. Having one and having speech, the name "two" arises. Then, taking the later name "two" and contrasting it with the earlier wondrous One, having one and having two—can this not be called three? From three onward, even if there were one skilled in calculation, they could not record its number—how much less the ordinary kind? Thus, from non-being to being, it reaches three; how much more from being to being?

**[Annotation]** The One is without speech, yet with speech it reaches three. How much more when tracing its endless numbers—can they be exhausted?

**[Exegesis]** "Self" means "from"; "to" means "go." The ultimate principle is without speech; with speech, names arise. Thus, from no speech to speech, as soon as there is speech, it reaches three. How much more from speech to speech, where branches and streams divide—can they be exhausted? This clarifies that all methods originally have no names; from non-being they arise, and thus they reach this point. There is no "to" in this; it is simply so.

**[Annotation]** Each rests in what it can do—this is most fitting.

**[Exegesis]** All dharmas are empty and illusory—why single out names and speech? Thus, non-being is not truly non-being, and being is not truly being; names and numbers of being and non-being are all quiescent in themselves. Since there is no going from non-being to being, how could there be going from being to being? Thus, there is no need to fixate on coming or going; one simply follows the nature of things.

The Dao has never had boundaries.

**[Annotation]** It is obscurely present everywhere.

**[Exegesis]** The Dao is present everywhere, and wherever it is present, there is nothing. Vast and unbounded, what boundaries could it have?

Speech has never had constancy.

**[Annotation]** Speech varies with perspective, so right and wrong are not fixed.

**[Exegesis]** The principle of the Dao is empty and unobstructed, without limits; thus, teachings adapt to things and have no fixed constancy.

For this reason, there is contention.

**[Annotation]** The Dao has no boundaries, so the myriad things freely realize their own divisions.

**[Exegesis]** Contention refers to boundaries. The principle has no limits, and teachings adapt to things; thus, for the sake of meaning, boundaries differ.

Let us speak of these boundaries:

**[Exegesis]** This sets up a hypothetical question to introduce what follows.

There is left, there is right.

**[Annotation]** Each has its own convenience.

**[Exegesis]** Left is yang; right is yin. Though the principle is serene and still, teachings necessarily follow conditions. Boundaries differ, and positions vary—thus there are east and west, left and right, spring and autumn, life and death.

There are patterns, there are principles.

**[Annotation]** Every thing has its pattern; every affair has its fittingness.

**[Exegesis]** Patterns are principles. Principles are fittingness. Though the myriad things are entangled, principles exist within them; though the ten thousand affairs are diverse, each follows what is fitting.

There are divisions, there are distinctions.

**[Annotation]** Groups are divided and kinds are distinguished.

**[Exegesis]** Distinctions are separations. Though birds and beasts are many, each has its own group; though the natures of things are myriad, each follows its own kind.

There is competition, there is strife.

**[Annotation]** Competing together is called competition; opposing and disputing is called strife.

**[Exegesis]** The natures of things are dull and foolish, each clinging to self and other. Thus, they compete for victory and defeat, oppose and dispute right and wrong.

These are called the Eight Powers.

**[Annotation]** Briefly distinguishing them, there are these eight powers.

**[Exegesis]** "Powers" are names for functions. The functions of all things transform endlessly; briefly enumerating them, there are these eight kinds. This explains the meaning of the earlier contention.

Beyond the Six Directions, the sage acknowledges but does not discuss.

**[Annotation]** Beyond the Six Directions refers to what lies beyond the nature and portion of the myriad things. Though principle exists beyond the nature of things, it does not pertain to what is within their nature, so it does not move the sage. Thus, the sage does not discuss it. If he were to discuss it, it would be to lead the myriad things to learn what they cannot.

**[Exegesis]** The Six Directions are heaven, earth, and the four quarters. Beyond the Six Directions lies what is beyond the nature and portion of sentient beings—the realm of the profoundest Dao. The profound origin is formless, transcending the limits of the four propositions; the wondrous principle is subtle and imperceptible, surpassing what lies beyond the Six Directions.

Since it transcends what the divine tongue can articulate, it is preserved yet left undiscussed. Within the Six Directions, the sage discusses but does not debate.

**[Annotation]** He sets forth their nature and leaves them at peace.

**[Exegesis]** Within the Six Directions lies the nature and portion bestowed upon the living. All these so-called distinctions and classifications arise from deluded sentiments; when one traces their roots, they are but empty existence. The sage responds to their impulses, setting forth what accords with them. Since they are but illusions, there is nothing to debate in detail—hence the following text states, "I too speak in delusion." The *Spring and Autumn Annals* embodies the intent of the former kings; the sage debates but does not contend.

**[Annotation]** He follows what has already taken shape and solidifies it at the ultimate point of rightness, without clinging to his own correctness to condemn others.

**[Exegesis]** *Spring and Autumn* refers to an era; *Annals* refers to canonical records. The former kings are the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. *Intent* means to record. From the lineage of the Yellow Emperor and Zhuanxu to the models of Yao and Shun, the eras were documented as canonical teachings, guiding the living and transmitted through the ages. The sage’s debates bring benefit to the times, yet he never clings to right or wrong, nor stagnates in fixed paths. Thus, where there is division, there is also non-division; where there is contention, there is also non-contention.

**[Annotation]** Things divide themselves; affairs distinguish themselves. To insist on imposing one’s own divisions is to overlook their inherent distinctions.

**[Exegesis]** Principle is without division, yet things possess right and wrong. To arise within the boundless and unbounded and yet generate views of division and contention—this is the way of the one-sided scholar, the obstinate person. How could they dissect the subtle or distinguish the myriad things?

It is asked: Why is this so?

**[Exegesis]** A hypothetical question is posed to clarify the meaning.

The sage embraces it—
**[Annotation]** To embrace non-contention is the embrace; the sage has no embrace.
**[Exegesis]** The sage who fathoms principle and merges mind with the Dao can enfold self and other, encompass right and wrong, like withered wood or dead ashes, utterly without division.

The common people contend with it to display themselves.
Thus it is said: Where there is contention, there is also non-perception.
**[Annotation]** Not perceiving the self-contention of others, they contend with what they themselves know to display it.
**[Exegesis]** The multitude—another name for sentient beings—are deluded and obstinate, failing to grasp the illusory. Thus they contend with what they know, displaying it to others. Not only do they fail to perceive the self-distinction of others, they also fail to reflect upon their own subtle Dao. Hence it is said: there is non-perception.

The great Dao cannot be named—
**[Annotation]** It entrusts itself to self-naming, without any designation.
**[Exegesis]** The great Dao is vast and empty, surpassing form and name. Since it is neither color nor sound, it cannot be named. Those who embody the Dao likewise cease all utterance.

Great disputation does not speak—
**[Annotation]** It distinguishes itself.
**[Exegesis]** Profoundly awakened to the true source, there is nothing to be said. Thus, though it carves and adorns the myriad things, in speech it remains wordless.

Great benevolence is not benevolent—
**[Annotation]** It exists without attachment.
**[Exegesis]** It nurtures all beings, bestowing love without intent, like spring’s verdure, not for the sake of the seven grains.

Great integrity is not modest—
**[Annotation]** The utterly sufficient: things come and go, yet it is not they. Thus there is nowhere for modesty to lodge.
**[Exegesis]** The one who profoundly awakens sees through both emptiness and existence, knowing all realms to be illusory, not a single one worthy of claim. Self and other are both empty—where would there be room for deference?

Great courage does not rely on force—
**[Annotation]** Without going, there is nothing it does not follow; thus it encounters no peril it does not traverse.
**[Exegesis]** *Kuai* means opposition. Within, it harbors compassion; without, it extends to all things. Thus it can humble itself to the dust of the world, bestowing kindness upon the multitudes, emptying itself to meet the moment, never opposing.

The Dao that is manifest is not the Dao—
**[Annotation]** To illuminate this by that is to lose both.
**[Exegesis]** To display one’s merit and fame, flaunting it before others—this is excess and falsity, not the true Dao.

Speech that contends does not reach—
**[Annotation]** It cannot reach the self-distinction of things.
**[Exegesis]** Unable to abide in profound silence, it remains mired in names and words. Ornate phrases and superficial contention fail to penetrate deep principle.

Benevolence that is constant does not succeed—
**[Annotation]** Things have no constant love; constant love is necessarily incomplete.
**[Exegesis]** Unable to forget attachment and release knowledge, to merge self and other in mystery, yet always harboring kindness, ever clinging to partiality—though it seeks to achieve success, it will never be seen.

Integrity that is pure is not trustworthy—
**[Annotation]** Conspicuously pure and untainted, it is merely one who hungers for reputation, not truly pure.
**[Exegesis]** Standing apart from the world, lofty and aloof, its intent lies in fame, not true purity.

Courage that relies on skill does not succeed—
**[Annotation]** The courage of opposition is detested by all under heaven; there is no ground on which it can stand.
**[Exegesis]** Abandoning compassion to be courageous, opposing the sentiments of others, it is detested by all and can achieve nothing.

When these five are rounded, one nearly approaches rectitude—
**[Annotation]** These five all injure what is fitting through their having. Unable to rest in their original nature, they seek without end.
To seek what cannot be sought externally is like trying to fit a circle into a square, or a fish longing to be a bird. Though one may aspire to phoenixes and emulate the sun and moon, the closer one draws to them, the farther one strays from reality. The more one learns, the more one loses one’s nature. Thus, when things are equalized, the burden of partiality vanishes.

**[Exegesis]** *Yuan* means round. *Ji* means near. The five refer to the earlier manifestations of the Dao, speech, benevolence, integrity, and courage. The learner of the Dao should remain hidden and obscure; yet to vaunt one’s abilities and display them before others is to distance oneself from the Dao. It is like admiring squares while trying to learn circles, or loving flight while delighting in swimming. Though one may aspire to phoenixes, one will never attain their soaring; though one may emulate the sun and moon, one will never achieve their brilliance.

To know where to stop in what one does not know is perfection—
**[Annotation]** What one does not know lies beyond one’s nature. Thus to stop within what one knows is to reach perfection.
**[Exegesis]** Realms are vast or small, wisdom bright or dim. What wisdom does not reach should not be forcibly known. To know where to stop within one’s capacity is the ultimate achievement in learning.

Who knows the disputation of non-speech, the Dao of non-Dao?
If one can know this, it is called the celestial treasury.
**[Annotation]** Vast and all-embracing, it follows its own course.
**[Exegesis]** Who knows the speech of non-speech, the Dao of non-Dao? To accumulate such disputation and employ it to connect with things is to be in accord with the natural treasury.

Pour into it without filling it, draw from it without depleting it—
**[Annotation]** The mind of the perfected one is like a mirror: it responds but does not store. Thus it remains vast, without change of fullness or emptiness.
**[Exegesis]** The great sea is deep and boundless, its shores unfathomable. A hundred rivers pour into it without filling it; the Tail Gate drains it without depleting it. The great sage who embodies the Dao is likewise. Myriad affairs arise at once without disturbing his spirit; a thousand difficulties confront him without alarming his thoughts. Thus he can enfold all existence, treasuring all beings. It is like a mirror hung high in the hall: things come and are reflected. The wisdom that reflects does not know whence it comes—it is as if reflecting yet forgetting, forgetting yet reflecting.

This is called preserving one’s light.
**[Annotation]** Allowing it to shine of itself, its light is never exhausted.
**[Exegesis]** *Bao* means to conceal.

Though utterly forgotten, it reflects; though reflecting, it forgets—thus it can conceal its light, and its light grows ever brighter. This concludes the preceding discussion of the Celestial Treasury.

Of old, Yao asked Shun: “I wish to punish the states of Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I sit facing south as ruler, I remain unsettled. What is the reason?”

**[Annotation]** His grasp of the Way of ease and compliance was not yet expansive, so he found no joy in holding court.

This question was posed to illuminate the principle of equalizing all things through the great sage, and so he raised this self-puzzled query to elicit an answer.

**[Exegesis]** *Shiran* means a look of contentment. Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao were the names of three small border states in Yao’s time. “Facing south” signifies the ruler’s position. Shun was a sixth-generation descendant of Zhuanxu. His father was named Gusou, his mother Wodeng; she conceived him after perceiving a great rainbow. Born at Yaoxu, he took the surname Yao; dwelling by the Wei River, he was also called the Wei clan. His eyes had double pupils, so he was styled Chonghua. His benevolence and filial piety were renowned in his village, and Yao, hearing of his virtue, gave him his two daughters in marriage and enfeoffed him at Yu. At thirty, he oversaw the hundred offices; at thirty-three, he received Yao’s abdication. After ascending the throne, he established his capital at Puban. He ruled for forty years before yielding to Yu. After his death, he was buried in the wilds of Cangwu.

Now, these three states had failed in their tribute, so it was fitting to consider punishing them. Yet the matter remained unresolved, and so he found no joy in holding court. To clarify the principle of equalizing all things, the dialogue was entrusted to these two sages.

Shun replied: “Those three lords still dwell among the mugwort and reeds. If you remain unsettled, what is the reason?”

**[Annotation]** What great beings find ease in is without meanness—thus the mugwort and reeds are the very realm of excellence for those three.

**[Exegesis]** The “three lords” are the rulers of the three states. Mugwort and reeds are lowly plants, yet even the quail and snipe find them sufficient for their ease. How much more so for the lords of those border states, who have all they need to nurture themselves? Why, then, do you remain unsettled?

“Of old, when ten suns appeared together, the myriad things were all illuminated.

**[Annotation]** When a second sun ascends the sky, the six directions are fully lit—there is no mugwort or reed that is not bathed in light.

How much more so for one whose virtue surpasses the sun?

**[Annotation]** Though the sun and moon shine without partiality, there are still places they do not reach. Virtue, however, knows no such limits.

Now, to deprive the mugwort and reeds of their wishes and force them to submit—how could this be called an expansive grasp of the supreme Way? Thus your spirit remains unsettled.

If all things flourish according to their nature, each resting in what it finds ease in, whether distant or near, hidden or deep, left to itself, each attains its fullest potential—then nothing will be amiss for them, and nothing will fail to bring you joy.

**[Exegesis]** *Jin* means “to surpass.” The *Huainanzi* states: “In Yao’s time, ten suns appeared together, scorching the crops, killing the grasses and trees, and causing giant serpents to harm the people. Yao sent Yi to shoot the suns, and he brought down nine of them. He also slew the giant serpents to rid the people of their harm.” When ten suns ascend the sky, the six directions are all illuminated, yet beneath an overturned basin or in a hidden place, there may still be darkness. But where the sage’s virtue reaches, no darkness remains unilluminated. Wielding such wisdom surpasses even the three luminaries—yet now you would raise weapons to force others to submit. How can this be called an expansive grasp of the Way of ease and compliance?

Nie Que asked Wang Ni: “Do you know what all things agree is right?”

**[Exegesis]** Nie Que was a teacher of Xu You, and Wang Ni was his disciple—both were worthy men of Yao’s time. These two are invoked to illustrate the equalizing of all things. Things are confused in their judgments, each holding to its own views, all deeming themselves right and others wrong. Do you know whether this is truly so?

Wang Ni replied: “How would I know?”

**[Annotation]** What they agree on may not be right, and what they differ on may not be wrong. Thus neither can correct the other, and there is no use for knowledge.

**[Exegesis]** Wang Ni answered Nie Que: “Each side has its own right and wrong, leaving no fixed standard. If I were to use my knowledge to judge them, my knowledge would itself become right or wrong. So how would I know?”

“Do you know what you do not know?”

**[Exegesis]** Since you do not know what all things agree is right, do you at least know what you yourself do not know? This question moves from the superficial to the profound, progressively probing the essence, using the exchange between teacher and disciple to reveal the deeper meaning.

Wang Ni replied: “How would I know?”

**[Annotation]** If you knew what you did not know, that would still be a form of knowing. Such knowing cannot allow the myriad talents to find their own rightness.

**[Exegesis]** If you used knowledge to know what you do not know, that “not knowing” would itself become a kind of knowing. Thus he repeats, “How would I know?” and answers again with “not knowing.”

“Then are things without knowledge?”

**[Exegesis]** Pressing further: “If you yourself have no knowledge, do things themselves lack knowledge?”

Wang Ni replied: “How would I know?”

**[Annotation]** To know nothing at all is to be vast and open, allowing all things to find their own course.

**[Exegesis]** It is not only that I do not know—things themselves also do not know. Both inner and outer are utterly forgotten, so there is no place to apply knowledge.

“Nevertheless, let me try to say something.

**[Annotation]** Because he does not know, he does not dare to speak definitively—he only ventures to try.

**[Exegesis]** *Ranhu* means “nevertheless.” Since there is no knowledge, there is no principle to be spoken of, nothing definite to be said—so he merely tries.

How could I know that what I call knowing is not not-knowing?

**[Annotation]** Fish swim in water, and all creatures in the water are said to know it. Yet from the perspective of a bird, what the fish call knowing is not knowing at all. The cicada’s knowledge lies in its ninefold molting, and it laughs at the silk moth for prizing its cocoon. Thus what is agreed upon as knowing cannot be taken as a fixed standard.

**[Exegesis]** Some things know this but not that, or know that but not this.”

Fish and birds inhabit water and land—this illustrates the point. Thus, knowing is not-knowing, and not-knowing is knowing. How could the common person comprehend this principle? How could I know that what I call not-knowing is not knowing?

**[Annotation]** What is called not-knowing is simply difference, yet it is also a kind of knowing in its own right.

**[Exegesis]** What is called not-knowing is merely a lack of mutual understanding, not true ignorance.

Let me try to ask you this:

**[Annotation]** Since I do not know what is correct, I venture to ask you.

**[Exegesis]** As principle admits no fixed words, I dare not assert definitively—so I turn and question you in return.

When people sleep in dampness, they suffer from lumbago and partial paralysis—yet does the loach do the same? When people dwell in trees, they tremble with fear—yet does the gibbon do the same? Which of these three knows the proper place to dwell?

**[Annotation]** This briefly cites three examples to illustrate the differing conveniences of the myriad things.

**[Exegesis]** *Zhuili xunju* are terms for fear and dread. The phrase "does it do the same?" means "it is not so." People who sleep on damp ground fall ill with lumbago and partial paralysis, yet how could the loach suffer thus? People who dwell in trees are gripped by terror, yet gibbons leap and bound without fear. The natures of things differ, and their conveniences vary. Thus, these three examples show that none among the myriad things knows the definitive place to dwell.

People prize humble thatched huts and golden palaces—yet where does honor or disgrace truly lie? People eat domesticated animals, deer feed on grass, centipedes relish snakes, and crows and kites crave mice—which of these four knows the true flavor?

**[Annotation]** This briefly cites four examples to illustrate that beauty and ugliness have no fixed standard.

**[Exegesis]** *Chu* refers to grass, the food of oxen and sheep; *huan* means "reared," the food of dogs and pigs—both named after what they eat. Deer feed on lush grass, crows and kites relish rotting mice, and centipedes devour snakes. These four examples show that none can determine the definitive flavor. Thus, sumptuous feasts and simple fare ultimately share the same end.

Gibbons and macaques mate with each other, deer couple with deer, and loaches swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Li Ji are considered beauties by humans—yet when fish see them, they dive deep; when birds see them, they fly high; when deer see them, they flee swiftly. Which of these four knows the true beauty of the world?

**[Annotation]** This briefly cites four examples to illustrate that the preferences of the world differ.

**[Exegesis]** Gibbons and macaques take each other as mates, deer intertwine with deer, and loaches play with fish. Mao Qiang was the favored concubine of the King of Yue; Li Ji was the beloved consort of the state of Jin. These two women were peerless in beauty, yet when fish see them, they are frightened and plunge deep; when birds see them, they are startled and fly high; when deer see them, they bolt away. These four examples show that none knows the definitive beauty of the world. Thus, the common person, deluded and foolish, arbitrarily generates love and hate—yet when examined by principle, who can determine right and wrong?

Next, *cui* describes a sudden, urgent appearance. From my perspective, the origins of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and chaotic—how could I discern their distinctions?

**[Annotation]** What benefits one may harm another, and as the "ones" and "anothers" of the world are endless, the boundaries of right and wrong are ever-shifting. Thus, only by refraining from debate and allowing each to be as it is can all things be harmoniously resolved.

**[Exegesis]** Things are manifold, yet none is not oneself. Thus, practicing benevolence and upholding righteousness yield different outcomes: what benefits me may harm another, and what is right for another may be wrong for me. Viewed from the shifting perspectives of self and other, the paths of right and wrong, the threads of benevolence and righteousness, become entangled and confused—like a chaotic jumble of dishes. With no fixed standard, how could I know their distinctions?

Nie Que said: "If you do not know benefit and harm, does the perfected person likewise not know benefit and harm?"

**[Annotation]** Not yet having grasped the subtlety of not-knowing, he still suspects that the perfected person ought to know.

**[Exegesis]** Nie Que, not yet awakened to the mutual unknowing of self and other, raises a further doubt about benefit and harm. He asks: "You are a perfected person—should you not know benefit and harm?" Yet the perfected person’s lack of distinction is like wandering in the dark. This repeated questioning awaits a later response.

Wang Ni said: "The perfected person is divine."

**[Annotation]** Without intention, yet nothing is not in accord.

**[Exegesis]** *Zhi* denotes the wondrous ultimate; *shen* denotes unfathomable function. The sage is empty and formless, responding to things without fixed pattern—knowing yet not knowing, discerning yet not discerning. How could the perfected person be measured by the conjectures of human thought?

Great marshes may burn, yet they cannot make him hot; the Yellow River and the Milky Way may freeze, yet they cannot make him cold; swift thunder may shatter mountains and winds may shake the sea, yet they cannot startle him.

**[Annotation]** One whose spirit is whole and form complete, whose body merges with things, though traversing the most extreme changes, never ceases to be oneself—thus, nothing lingers or obstructs in his breast.

**[Exegesis]** *Hu* means "frozen." When marshes burn and rivers freeze, when thunder roars and shatters mountains, when gales surge and shake the sea—yet the perfected person’s spirit remains undisturbed, his body merging with things. Fire and water do not harm him, nor can wind and thunder startle him. Such is his state: empty and serene, without intention, like drifting clouds shading all beings, moving in accord with things.

Thus, he rides the clouds and qi,

**[Annotation]** Borrowing things to move, not moving himself.

**[Exegesis]** Day and night alternate, yet there is no distinction of life and death.

rides the sun and moon,

**[Annotation]** There is day and night, yet no life and death.

**[Exegesis]** The succession of dusk and dawn divides day and night, yet dwelling in harmony with the times, there is no difference between life and death.

Thus he reins in and guides the myriad things, bearing and conveying all beings endowed with spirit—hence the name "riding" and "mounting."

And he roams beyond the four seas.
**[Annotation]** Only by lacking knowledge and entrusting all under Heaven to its own spontaneity can one gallop through the ten thousand things without exhaustion.
**[Exegesis]** Movement and stillness coincide; the true and the responsive arise as one. Seated at the center of the cosmos, his mind roams beyond the four seas.

Death and life bring no change to him,
**[Annotation]** He embodies transformation, so death and life are as one.
and how much less the beginnings of profit and harm?
**[Annotation]** Compared to death and life, profit and harm are even less worthy of concern.
**[Exegesis]** Profit and harm are but gains and losses in the course of life. Since death and life are as day and night, riding transformation to roam freely, how could profit and harm—mere shadows of death and life—ever disturb his mind?

Juquezi asked Master Changwu: "I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs,
**[Annotation]** Affairs come of themselves, and principle responds of itself—he does not follow to attend to them.
**[Exegesis]** *Wu* (affairs) means *shi* (matters). *Zhu* means "to." Juque was a disciple of Changwu, hence he called his teacher "the Master." The sage who embodies the Dao forgets cares and merges with things; though he partakes in affairs, he does not treat them as tasks. Mingling his traces with the dust of the world, he remains utterly without intention—how could he set his mind or harbor feelings to follow after things? Juque, seeking further instruction, was thus puzzled by what he had previously heard.

does not pursue profit, nor shun harm,
**[Annotation]** He advances straightforwardly, without avoiding or seeking.
**[Exegesis]** *Wei* means "to avoid." Embracing the turning points of fate and penetrating the timeliness of profit and harm, he pushes forward with principle, without avoiding or seeking.

does not delight in seeking,
**[Annotation]** He does not rejoice in seeking, nor resent direct taking.
**[Exegesis]** His wondrous awakening comes from afar, so when things seek him, he does not respond with delight.

nor cling to the Dao;
**[Annotation]** He is uniquely perfected.
**[Exegesis]** The sage’s wisdom is profound and still, illuminating things without attachment. Neither advancing nor retreating, neither arising nor ceasing, he certainly does not practice the all-pervading Dao with a mind of clinging.

without speech there is speech, with speech there is no speech,
**[Annotation]** Whatever bears the name of "speech" is not what I call speech—each simply speaks for itself. Thus, there is no "speech" for them, yet there is "no speech" for me.
**[Exegesis]** *Wei* means "teaching." The perfected person who embodies the Dao is empty, level, still, and absolute. Descending from the root and flowing forth, he responds and communicates. Thus, in governing and teaching, there is "speech" where there is no speech, and "no speech" where there is speech.

and he roams beyond the dust and grime.
**[Annotation]** All that is not true nature is dust and grime.
**[Exegesis]** Shining with the light of the world, he mingles with the dust yet remains unstained. Thus, though dwelling amid the dust of the world, his mind advances beyond the dust and grime.

The Master deemed these careless words, but I consider them the practice of the wondrous Dao. What do you think?"

"How is this? What is called 'not following the equalizing Dao' is to exhaust principle and fulfill one's nature. Qūquè takes it as the practice of the wondrous Dao, while Changwu treats it as careless talk. I do not know how this principle stands—what is to be considered right?"

Changwuzi said: "This is what even the Yellow Emperor found perplexing to hear, and how could I, Qiu, be sufficient to comprehend it?

**[Exegesis]** *Listening perplexed* describes a state of confusion and obscurity. The ultimate Dao is profoundly mysterious, not something that can be fathomed through names and words. Even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, though sages, could not fully expound its wondrous principle when discoursing on the ultimate truth. In the end, they remained perplexed and confused, unable to attain clarity. Who am I to claim understanding? Some texts write *Huang* (Yellow) as *Xuan* (Dark), referring to the Yellow Emperor. Moreover, you are far too hasty in your judgment—seeing an egg and demanding the crow of the rooster at dawn, or seeing a slingshot and craving the roasted meat of a magpie.

**[Annotation]** All things have their natural course, and principle has its ultimate limit. Following it directly leads to a state of dark harmony, which cannot be expressed in words. Thus, those who speak of it do so carelessly, and those who hear it remain perplexed. Even the Yellow Emperor could not make all things free from doubt, for in the end, they remained perplexed. Therefore, the sage abides beyond the dust and grime, mysteriously uniting with what lies beyond sight and hearing. He illuminates with the light of Heaven without contriving, and lets things be as they are without forcing clarity. Now, Qūquè, upon hearing careless words, immediately takes them as the practice of the wondrous Dao—this is no different from seeing an egg and demanding the rooster’s crow at dawn, or seeing a slingshot and expecting the roasted meat of a magpie. Those who cannot rest in the present and follow the natural order, who probe into change and seek transformation, who contemplate death while still living, and who cling to right to debate wrong—these are all contrivers who go against the natural course.

**[Exegesis]** The *què* is the magpie, as described in Jia Yi’s *Fu*. It is about the size of a hen, resembles a turtledove, is bluish-green in color, and its meat is very fine, suitable for stews or roasting, found in the regions south of the Yangtze. Yet an egg has the potential to produce a rooster, but at the egg stage, it cannot yet crow at dawn; a slingshot may strike a wagtail, but at the moment of the shot, it cannot yet be roasted—just as teachings may expound the wondrous principle, but at the time of teaching, they are not yet the principle itself. Now, Qūquè, upon merely hearing words, takes them as the wondrous Dao—this judgment is far too hasty. I have spoken to you carelessly,

**[Annotation]** To speak of it is already careless, so I merely try speaking carelessly. You should listen carelessly as well.

why?

**[Annotation]** If you were to listen seriously to careless words, that would again be far too hasty. Therefore, why not listen carelessly as well?

**[Exegesis]** *I* refers to myself. *Why* is an interrogative. The ultimate truth is wordless; to speak of it is careless. I merely try speaking carelessly to you—how about you listen carelessly in return? Also, *why* here is the sound of *what*. Abiding by the sun and moon, embracing the cosmos.

**[Annotation]** Taking life and death as day and night is the metaphor for abiding by the sun and moon; taking the myriad things as one body is the metaphor for embracing the cosmos.

**[Exegesis]** *Abiding* means relying upon. *Embracing* means holding within. The universe encompasses the four directions of space, while time encompasses past and present. The sage who accords with principle forgets things and forgets self, thereby encompassing all existence and mysteriously uniting life and death. Thus, Guo’s annotation states: taking life and death as day and night is the metaphor for abiding by the sun and moon; taking the myriad things as one body is the metaphor for embracing the cosmos. For such a state of dark harmony, set aside confusion and delusion, and regard all as equally noble.

**[Annotation]** Because there is that which is considered base, hierarchy arises, and with it, confusion and disorder that no one can rectify. Each claims to be right in their own way. Therefore, for the Dao that harmonizes naturally, nothing is better than setting it aside without words and leaving it to be as it is. *Dark harmony* means without boundaries or limits.

**[Exegesis]** *Dark* describes a state of undifferentiation. *Set aside* means to let be. *Confusion* means disorder. *Delusion* means convergence. *Servants* refer to menials, a term of lowliness. The sentiments of the world are inverted, clinging to false hierarchies of noble and base. Now, if the sage wishes to correct this delusion and establish the Dao of dark harmony, nothing is better than allowing confusion and disorder to follow their course, regarding all as equally noble, whether high or low. The common people toil endlessly,

**[Annotation]** They gallop through the realm of right and wrong.

the sage is foolishly serene,

**[Annotation]** A state of effortless unknowing, moving directly forward.

**[Exegesis]** *Toil endlessly* describes a state of restless motion. *Foolishly serene* describes a state of unknowing. The people of the world chase after external things, laboring without cease. The one who embodies the Dao forgets knowledge and abandons perception, remaining tranquil and appearing foolish. They encompass the myriad ages as one pure whole.

**[Annotation]** *Pure* means unadulterated. To survey the myriad ages and observe their changes, the common people call this disorder, hence they toil in restless motion, straining body and mind to abandon one thing and pursue another. Only the great sage, free from attachment, remains serene and moves directly forward, uniting with transformation as one. In this unity with transformation, he constantly roams in solitude. Thus, though he intermingles with countless ages, myriad differences, and endless variations, when the Dao moves through them and achieves completion, past and present become one; when things are named and thus made so, the myriad things become one. Nothing is not so, no time is not complete—this may be called *pure*.

**[Exegesis]** The sage harmonizes his virtue with the two forces and unites his body with the myriad things. Thus, he can follow change and adapt to the world. Though ages pass from ancient to present, times shift between peace and peril, and he intermingles with the dust of the world in a thousand differences and ten thousand variations, he remains indifferent and at ease, untroubled by any concern, holding to the one and the pure, ever abiding in the wondrous ultimate. The myriad things are all so,

**[Annotation]** Nothing is not so.

and thus they are mutually enfolded.

**[Annotation]** *Enfolded* means accumulated. Accumulating *this* over the myriad ages, the myriad ages become one *this*.

Accumulating *this* in the myriad things, the myriad things all become *this*. Thus, one knows not where lies the priority of life and death, nor where the victory or defeat of self and other resides.

**[Exegesis]** *Enfolded* means accumulated. The sentiments of things, long bound by attachment, persist. Hence, when people recklessly discuss the myriad things, none fails to assert "I am so, others are not"; when they obstinately argue over past and present, all insist "I am right, others are wrong." Though the myriad things be many and past and present far removed, the accumulation of right and wrong never ceases. The sage, however, follows the world’s rise and fall, moves yet remains ever still, blending and harmonizing through countless ages into a single, unchanging purity.

How do I know that delight in life is not delusion?

**[Annotation]** Life and death are one, yet one delights solely in life, desiring to oppose transformation—how then can one know this is not delusion?

**[Exegesis]** The forge and hammer of the myriad things have never been unequal; transformation, life, and death share a single principle. Yet to delight solely in life and abhor death—how is this not delusion?

How do I know that aversion to death is not like one who, having lost their home in youth, does not know to return?

**[Annotation]** To lose one’s former dwelling in youth is called *weak loss*. Those who suffer weak loss grow content with their new place and do not know to return to their homeland. How then do we know that life is not such a weak loss, or that death is not a return—yet we abhor it?

**[Exegesis]** *Weak* refers to youth; *loss* means to be deprived. It speaks of those who, in their youth, encounter chaos, lose their homeland, grow content in foreign soil, and do not know to return—this is called *weak loss*. To emerge from nothing into being is called life; to return from being to nothing is called death. To cling to life and abhor death—is this not like weak loss, not knowing to return?

Li Ji was the daughter of the border warden of Ai in the state of Li. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her tears soaked her collar. Yet once she arrived at the king’s palace, shared his couch and table, and ate fine meats, she regretted her tears.

**[Annotation]** Within a single life, emotions change thus. In that moment, one does not know the other—how much less can one know the change between life and death?

**[Exegesis]** Long ago, Duke Mu of Qin and Duke Xian of Jin jointly attacked the state of Li Rong, capturing a beautiful woman and two jade rings. Qin took the rings, and Jin took the woman—she was the daughter of the border warden of Ai in Li Rong. *Kuang* means "to correct." At first, leaving Li Rong, parting from her kin, and longing for her homeland, she wept until her tears soaked her collar. Later, arriving in Jin, she was favored and exalted, sharing the duke’s chambers and feasts, with sumptuous dishes filling the hall. Her affections shifted, and she regretted her earlier tears. Within a single life, emotions change thus—how much less can one know the difference between life and death? This is a parable by Zhuangzi, hence he refers to Duke Xian as "king."

How do I know that the dead do not regret their initial pursuit of life?

**[Annotation]** *Xin* means "to seek."

**[Exegesis]** *Xin* means "to seek." When Li Ji arrived in Jin, she regretted her earlier tears—how do we know the dead do not likewise regret their initial pursuit of life?

One who dreams of drinking wine may wake and weep; one who dreams of weeping may wake and go hunting.

**[Annotation]** This is the change between waking and dreaming. If events change, so too do emotions—thus the wishes of life and death cannot be the same. Therefore, when alive, one delights in life; when dead, one delights in death. Though life and death differ, in each attaining their wish, they are one—what then is there to cling to?

**[Exegesis]** The change between life and death is like the difference between waking and dreaming. Since waking and dreaming are distinct, so too are the emotions of life and death. Yet the world may wake from misfortune and dream of fortune—why then should death not bring joy and life sorrow? Thus, the boundary between waking and dreaming cannot be clung to.

When one dreams, one does not know it is a dream.

**[Annotation]** From this, we see that at the time of death, one likewise does not know it is death and simply follows one’s inclination.

**[Exegesis]** When one is dreaming, one does not know it is a dream—just as when one is dying, one does not know it is death. Each follows its inclination—what is there to cling to?

Within the dream, one may even divine the dream’s meaning.

**[Annotation]** The dreamer, within the dream, may divine its meaning—this is no different from the waking state.

Yet upon waking, one knows it was a dream.

**[Annotation]** In whatever one encounters, nothing is lacking—why then, while alive, should one fear death?

**[Exegesis]** While asleep and dreaming, one takes it as real and may even divine its auspices, pondering good and ill fortune. Only upon waking does one know it was a dream. Thus, when alive, one delights in life; when dead, one delights in death—why then, while alive, should one fear death?

Only after the great awakening does one know this was the great dream.

**[Annotation]** The awakened one is the sage. The great awakening knows that those who rest their cares in the heart have not yet awakened.

**[Exegesis]** The bustling masses, the teeming multitudes, rush through the realm of striving and action, lost in the great dream. Only the sage, embodying the Dao, awakens clearly and alone, knowing that those who rest their cares in the heart have not yet awakened.

Yet the foolish believe themselves awake, prattling on as if they know. "Lord!" "Herdsman!" How rigid and narrow!

**[Annotation]** The foolish, lost in the great dream, believe themselves awake. Thus, they prattle on, taking what they love as lords and what they hate as herdsmen, delighting in the bias of a single household—truly rigid and narrow.

**[Exegesis]** The sentiments of the world are foolish and deluded, stumbling as if wandering at night, lost in dreams yet believing themselves awake, prattling on about what they claim to know. What they love, they call lords; what they hate, they equate with herdsmen. To hold such sentiments—truly rigid and narrow.

The ox is called a herdsman, the horse a groom. As for me, Qiu, and you—we are all dreaming.

**[Annotation]** Not yet able to forget words and attain spiritual comprehension, one has not yet awakened to the great truth.

**[Exegesis]** Qiu is the name of Changwu. Even those who perceive and grasp true words still consider them dreams—how much less awakened are the foolish, prattling on as if they know? When I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming.

**[Annotation]** This is like interpreting dreams within a dream. To believe oneself dreaming is still not awakening—how much less so for those who prattle on, believing themselves awake?

**[Exegesis]** The deluded, lacking awakening, discuss dreams while still in dreams; their spoken words, not rooted in truth, remain entangled in language. Thus, interpreting dreams within dreams renders all dreams empty; testing words within words reveals their hollowness. This analogy of interpreting dreams within dreams merely concludes the reckless discourse. Such speech is called *diaogui*.

**[Annotation]** Extraordinary discourse is beyond the comprehension of ordinary people, hence it is called *diaodang zhuogui*—those who do not recognize its profound liberation.

**[Exegesis]** When the whole world is dreaming, this is profound discourse. Extraordinary words disregard convention, startling and confounding the common mind. Without clarity and penetration, who could grasp their depth? Only once in ten thousand generations does a great sage arise who understands their meaning—such an encounter is as fleeting as dawn or dusk.

**[Annotation]** Those who can shed all attachments and merge life and death in the Dao are exceedingly rare.

**[Exegesis]** Even after ten thousand years, a great sage may appear who sees the emptiness of the three realms, the illusory nature of the four births, and that all distinctions of self and other, all words, exist within dreams. Such a person of understanding is a rare encounter—whether distant or near, it is like meeting them at dawn or dusk. (Thirty years make a generation.)

Even if you and I were to debate—if you were to prevail over me, or I over you, would it truly mean that you are right and I am wrong?

**[Exegesis]** *若 (ruò)* and *而 (ér)* both mean "you." "If you do not prevail over me?" is a hypothetical question. In truth, right and wrong, self and other, are wholly unreal—those who invert and impose judgments are but deluded partisans. Suppose you and I were to contend: if you were to defeat me and I not defeat you, would your victory definitively prove you right and my defeat definitively prove me wrong? Certainly not. If I were to prevail over you, and you not prevail over me, would it definitively prove that I am right and you are wrong?

**[Annotation]** *若 (ruò)* and *而 (ér)* both mean "you."

**[Exegesis]** Suppose I were to overcome you, and you fall short of me—would that make me right and you definitively wrong? Each clings to partiality; neither is sufficient to rely upon. Might it be that one of us is right, or one of us is wrong? Might it be that both are right, or both are wrong?

**[Exegesis]** *或 (huò)* means "uncertain." Between you and me, one may be right or one may be wrong; in our contest of words, victory and defeat remain undecided. Thus, if one is right, it is not truly right; if one is wrong, it is not truly wrong. If both were right, there would be no wrong; if both were wrong, there would be no right. Therefore, right and wrong, self and other, arise from deluded sentiment.

You and I cannot know each other, and others are inevitably ensnared in the same confusion. Whom shall we appoint to judge?

**[Annotation]** Only when one does not know does one seek to infer; only when one does not see does one debate. Yet even after debate, one cannot be self-assured, for in contending with things, debate all day only leads to separation and obstruction—ultimately, none can be set right. Thus, one must leave it to self-correction.

**[Exegesis]** The two of us, each holding to partial views, both claim to be right—thus we cannot know each other. Even if we could, what one deems wrong, another deems right. Suppose there were another person to determine right and wrong: this person would still be bound by self and other, unable to escape right and wrong, each clinging to delusion and compounding confusion. With hearts entangled in attachment, perceptions remain obscured and unclear. If three people each hold fast to their views, whom shall we appoint to judge? *离合 (líhé)* means "obscure and unclear."

Shall we have one who agrees with you judge? Since they already agree with you, how could they set it right?

**[Exegesis]** If they share your view, they are no different from you—how could they determine what is right? This reiterates the first point.

Shall we have one who agrees with me judge? Since they already agree with me, how could they set it right?

**[Annotation]** Because they agree, they affirm it—but this is not sufficient to trust.

**[Exegesis]** The annotation states: "Because they agree, they affirm it—but this is not sufficient to trust." This reiterates the second point.

Shall we have one who differs from both you and me judge? Since they differ from both you and me, how could they set it right?

**[Annotation]** Because they differ, they point out faults—but this is also not sufficient to rely upon.

**[Exegesis]** Since they differ from you and me, they would only introduce new right and wrong—how could this be sufficient to rely upon? This reiterates the third point.

Shall we have one who agrees with both you and me judge? Since they already agree with both you and me, how could they set it right?

**[Annotation]** If what you affirm is truly right, then the world could have no one to deem it wrong; if what you deem wrong is truly wrong, then there would be no reason for anyone to deem it right. Now, one affirms what they agree with and rejects what they differ from—with agreement and difference both present, right and wrong have no fixed ground. Thus, right and wrong arise from the love of debate and rest in the equilibrium of Heaven. Entrust them to the two courses and let them resolve themselves.

**[Exegesis]** If both sides yield to partiality, right and wrong become two paths—no different from you and me, how could they set it right? This explains the fourth point.

In that case, neither you nor I nor others can know each other—must we await yet another?

**[Annotation]** Each must correct themselves. Awaiting another is not sufficient to set this right, for in the world, none can set another right. Thus, one must entrust it to self-correction to reach the end.

**[Exegesis]** You, I, and others are all bound by obscurity and confusion. With three people, each holding to one view and all claiming to be right, none can know the others. Since the three cannot decide, why seek yet another? If we await another, how would it differ from before? *彼也耶 (bǐ yě yé)* means "it is not necessary to await them."

What does it mean to harmonize with the *Heavenly Boundary*?

**[Annotation]** The *Heavenly Boundary* is the natural division.

**[Exegesis]** *Heaven* means "nature," and *Boundary* means "division." You and I cling to delusion, and right and wrong have no fixed ground—thus, the three people and four propositions cannot set it right. Therefore, this hypothetical debate is posed as a question and answer, harmonized by the natural division, leading to the absence of right and wrong. The meaning of the *Heavenly Boundary* is explained below.

It is said: "Is it not so? Is it so? Is it not so? Is it so?" If what is right is truly right, then its difference from what is not right would require no debate; if what is so is truly so, then its difference from what is not so would require no debate.

**[Annotation]** Right and wrong, so and not-so, oppose each other between self and other—thus, there is no debate. Without debate, one harmonizes with the *Heavenly Boundary*, abiding in the natural division alone, not awaiting another to set it right.

**[Exegesis]** *辩 (biàn)* means "to distinguish." Right and wrong, so and not-so arise from deluded sentiment; when examined by principle, they are wholly illusory. What is deemed right is not right; what is deemed so is not so. How do we know this? If what is right were definitively right, it would differ from what is not right; if what is so were definitively so, it would differ from what is not so. Yet now, what this one calls right, that one calls wrong; what that one deems so, this one deems not so. Thus, right and wrong, so and not-so, in principle do not differ—self and other oppose each other, deludedly making distinctions, and so there is no true debate. The mutual dependence of changing voices is like that which does not depend.

**[Commentary]** The debate of right and wrong is but a transforming voice. These transforming voices, mutually dependent, are all insufficient to set one another right—thus they are as though not dependent.

**[Exegesis]** Right and wrong, self and other, arise through mutual dependence; yet when examined by principle, this dependence is not real. Hence, in the voice of transformation, there is this name of "dependence"; but the name is not true, and the dependence is but an empty dependence. Since dependence is no dependence, we know it is not truly dependent. Harmonize it with the Heavenly Boundary, follow it through boundless transformation—this is how one spends one’s years.

**[Commentary]** Harmonize it with the natural division, yield to its limitless transformation. Pursuing this path, the realm of right and wrong naturally dissolves, and the ultimate end of one’s nature and destiny is fully realized.

**[Exegesis]** *Mànyǎn* means "transformation." *Yīn* means "to yield." *Qióng* means "to exhaust." Harmonizing with the natural division, there is neither right nor wrong; yielding to limitless transformation, one neither clings nor attaches. Thus, dwelling in accordance with fate and at ease with the times, one fulfills the nature and destiny of one’s allotted years. Forgetting years, forgetting righteousness, one’s spirit soars into the boundless—thus one lodges in the boundless.

**[Commentary]** Forgetting years unifies life and death; forgetting righteousness transcends right and wrong. When right and wrong, life and death are dissolved into one, this is the ultimate principle. The ultimate principle flows unbounded into the limitless—thus he who abides in it finds no end.

**[Exegesis]** *Zhèn* means "to flow freely." *Jìng* means "limit." *Yù* means "to lodge." Years are what life is endowed with; having unified life and death, one forgets years. Righteousness is the arbiter of right and wrong; having made right and wrong one, one forgets righteousness. This is to relinquish the previous understanding of right and wrong as endless. When life and death, right and wrong are dissolved into one, the wondrous principle flows freely, illuminating the boundless. To lodge in the boundless is to have no boundless in which to flow—this is yet another relinquishing of the limitless.

The Shadow of Doubt asked the Shadow: "Before, you were moving—now, you are still; before, you were sitting—now, you are rising."

"Why then do you lack steadfast resolve?"

**[Annotation]** *Wǎngliǎng* is the faint yin beyond the shadow.

**[Exegesis]** *Wǎngliǎng* is the faint yin beyond the shadow. *Nǎng* means "before" or "formerly." *Tè* means "alone." Zhuangzi employs allegory to expound profound principles, thus he borrows the shadow and the faint yin to illustrate the meaning of solitary transformation. The faint yin asks the shadow: "Before, you were moving—now, you are still; before, you were sitting—now, you are rising." If your movement and stillness, sitting and rising are all governed by form, and you merely follow after others without any independent will, why is this so?

The shadow replied: "Do I depend on something to be thus?"

**[Annotation]** It speaks of the heavenly mechanism operating of itself—sitting and rising require no dependence. For one who attains it without dependence, who could know its cause and demand its reason?

**[Exegesis]** All things in their forms and essences receive their nature spontaneously; though events seem to have causes, their principle lies in non-dependence. Even form and shadow, though not distant, partake of the heavenly mechanism. Thus, the myriad things, though varied, are all solitary transformations. "What I depend on—does it too depend on something to be thus?"

**[Annotation]** If one demands what it depends on and traces its origin, the inquiry would be endless, ultimately arriving at non-dependence, and the principle of solitary transformation would become clear.

**[Exegesis]** What the shadow depends on is form. If the shadow depends on form, and form depends on the Creator, then what does the Creator depend on? This chain of dependence would be endless, ultimately reaching non-dependence. "Do I depend on the slough of snakes or the wings of cicadas?"

**[Annotation]** If it depended on the slough of snakes or the wings of cicadas, the reason for its lack of steadfast resolve would not be difficult to discern. What is not understood is precisely that it does not depend on such things but transforms solitarily.

**[Exegesis]** Former commentators and Guo Xiang focused on this, claiming that *hàn* refers to the scales beneath a toad, and *tiáo yì* to the wings of a cicada. They said that snakes depend on scales to move, cicadas on wings to fly, and shadows on form to exist—yet this is not so. If flight depended on wings and movement on feet, the kinds of flying and walking creatures would be endless; why single out the slough of snakes and the wings of cicadas as examples? Now, *hàn* refers to the shed skin of a snake, and *tiáo yì* to the newly emerged shell of a cicada. When a snake sheds its old skin or a cicada emerges with a new shell, they do not know why, nor can they explain how—transforming solitarily, they depend on nothing. Even these two creatures, the snake and the cicada, shed their skins and shells, differing from other things, hence their mention. As the *Outer Chapters* state: "Do I depend on the slough of snakes or the shell of cicadas?" Thus, the principle of form and shadow is no different from that of shed skins and shells.

"How then do I know why it is so? How do I know why it is not so?"

**[Annotation]** Some in the world say that the faint yin depends on the shadow, the shadow on form, and form on the Creator. Let us ask: Does the Creator exist or not? If it does not exist, how can it create things? If it does exist, it is insufficient to account for the multitude of forms. Only by recognizing that the multitude of forms arise from themselves can one speak of creation. Thus, entering the realm of existing things, even the faint yin does not fail to transform solitarily in the profound darkness. Therefore, the Creator has no master, and each thing creates itself. Each thing creates itself without dependence—this is the norm of heaven and earth. Thus, self and other are mutually entailed, form and shadow arise together; though profoundly united, they do not depend on one another. Understanding this principle will make all things return to their root within themselves without depending on what is external. Externally, nothing is to be rejected; internally, nothing is to be prized. Thus, all things emerge serenely without knowing why they are born, and all attain their nature without knowing how they do so. Now, the faint yin’s relation to the shadow is like saying they arise together without dependence. Though the myriad things are numerous, they jointly complete heaven, and each distinctly manifests its solitary transformation. Thus, the faint yin is not governed by the shadow, the shadow is not controlled by form, and form is not transformed by nothingness. Whether transforming or not, being so or not, following others or acting from oneself—all are self-so. How could I know their reason? Therefore, to comply without aiding is to allow root and branch, inner and outer, to flow freely and attain their nature, merging indistinctly without trace. If one demands this proximate cause and forgets its self-so nature, clinging to things externally and losing the master within, then attachment and esteem arise. Though one may seek to equalize them, what is esteemed already resides in the heart—how can there be any leveling?

**[Exegesis]** Whether depending or not, being so or not, the heavenly mechanism unfolds of itself—no governing agent is known. How could one apply emotion to inquiry or engage thought in understanding? Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering and joyous as a butterfly, delighting in his own contentment.

**[Annotation]** Self-satisfied and at ease, moving with pleasure.

**[Exegesis]** *Xǔxǔ* describes a state of carefree delight. *Yù* means "to understand." The alternation of life and death, the succession of cold and heat—these are the constant ways of heaven and earth, the principles of the myriad things. Yet Zhuangzi, with luminous clarity like a mirror, roamed freely in the highest good. Thus, he could entrust dreams and waking to life and death, and lodge self and other in the transformation of things. Dreaming he was a butterfly, he fluttered in contentment; waking as Zhuang Zhou, he rejoiced in the continuity of his will. "I did not know I was Zhou."

**[Annotation]** While dreaming he was a butterfly and did not know he was Zhou, it was no different from being utterly dead. Yet wherever he was, he was content—thus, those who cling to life while alive should also cling to death when dead. From this perspective, those who grieve over death while alive are mistaken.

**[Exegesis]** When he was a butterfly, he understood clearly, delighting in his heart’s content, so joyous that he knew only he was a butterfly and not that he was Zhuang Zhou.

Death knows not life—its meaning is the same. Suddenly awake, he is Zhuang Zhou in vivid clarity.

**[Annotation]** Speaking from Zhou’s perspective, this is called "awakening," yet it is not necessarily not a dream.

**[Exegesis]** *Lianlian* describes the startling movement. In an instant, the dream ends and waking arrives; astonished, he reflects and recognizes himself as Zhuang Zhou. Thus the annotation states: speaking from Zhou’s perspective, this is called "awakening," yet it is not necessarily not a dream.

Was it Zhou who dreamed he was a butterfly, or the butterfly who dreamed it was Zhou?

**[Annotation]** Now not knowing the butterfly is no different from the dream’s not knowing Zhou. Each delights in its moment’s will—thus there is no way to prove the butterfly does not dream of being Zhou. The world has cases of dozing and dreaming a hundred years—thus there is no way to prove that this present hundred years is not a doze’s dream.

**[Exegesis]** Once he dreamed of being a butterfly, his heart fully at ease; now as Zhuang Zhou, he also speaks of contentment. Since waking and dreaming lack fixed certainty, how can one distinguish the reality or illusion of Zhou and the butterfly? Yet Zhou and the butterfly must have their division.

**[Annotation]** The distinction between waking and dreaming is no different from that between life and death. The reason one may compare them to contentment is that their division is fixed, not because there is no division.

**[Exegesis]** Whether awake or dreaming, whether butterfly or Zhou, to call them insubstantial is not without boundary. This is called the transformation of things.

**[Annotation]** Time does not pause for an instant, nor does the present endure. Thus yesterday’s dream has already transformed by today. The change of life and death—how is it different from this? Why trouble the heart over such matters? When one is this, one does not know that; dreaming of being a butterfly is an example. Taking it from a human perspective, in this one life, the present does not know the future—Lady Li is an example. Yet fools whisper to themselves, believing they know life’s joys and death’s sorrows, never having heard of the transformation of things.

**[Exegesis]** Ever-renewing change, the ceaseless flow of things—like the swift passage of a finger, like the fleeting exchange of glances. Thus Zhou and the butterfly, waking and dreaming, in an instant’s span, the later does not know the former, this does not know that. Why then, while alive, worry over death and vainly stir up grief and sorrow? Know that the coming and going of life and death are but the transformations of things’ principle.

Life is preserved through nurture, and thus nurturing life is the ultimate principle. Yet if nurture exceeds its proper limit, injuring life through nurture, it is no longer the true way of nurturing life.

"My life has its bounds."
*[Annotation]* The endowment each receives has its own limit.
*[Commentary]* *Bounds* means limit. Life, having received its form, is bestowed by nature; whether foolish or wise, long-lived or short-lived, each has its allotted measure. To know where to stop and guard one’s measure, not straying beyond it—this is the subtlety of nurturing life. Yet the common folk all speak of "I," and all who speak of "I" are those with limits. But knowledge has no bounds.

*[Annotation]* One who lifts a heavy burden lightly, with spirit and qi at ease, does so within the limits of his strength. Yet those who crave fame and compete for victory, though they exhaust their sinews, still cannot satisfy their desires. This is the boundlessness of knowledge. Thus, the name "knowledge" arises from misalignment and vanishes into profound limit. *Profound limit* means following one’s utmost measure without the slightest excess. Therefore, though bearing ten thousand *jun*, if it accords with one’s capacity, one suddenly forgets the weight upon the body; though responding to ten thousand affairs, one is oblivious to their presence within oneself—this is the true way of nurturing life.

*[Commentary]* The endowment of form and nature each has its fixed limit, yet discriminating knowledge pursues things without end. Thus, the mind labors with the body, never weary of its desires, unable to halt at its measure—this is not the true way of nurturing life. To follow the boundless with the bounded is perilous.

*[Annotation]* To pursue boundless knowledge with a limited nature—how could one not be exhausted?
*[Commentary]* Life is limited, but knowledge is boundless. Thus, to use limited life in pursuit of boundless knowledge is to weary the body and exhaust the spirit, leading to danger. Those who, already exhausted by knowledge, do not know to stop but instead employ knowledge to remedy it—this is nurture that injures, truly perilous indeed.

*[Commentary]* Boundless knowledge has already been employed, and deliberate learning follows to remedy it. How could one avoid peril?

"Do good without drawing near to fame; do evil without drawing near to punishment."
*[Annotation]* Forget good and evil, abide in the center, and let the myriad things act of themselves. Tranquil and merged with the ultimate rightness, punishment and fame are far removed, and the full principle resides within.
*[Commentary]* The learning of the vulgar world, though practiced by many, ultimately concerns itself with nothing before good and evil. Thus, doing good invariably draws near to fame, and doing evil invariably approaches punishment. This vulgar knowledge and learning cannot remedy prior excesses but only further exhausts the mind and spirit, increasing peril.

"Take the *lǜ* and *dū* as the constant."
*[Annotation]* Follow the center as the norm.
*[Commentary]* *Lǜ* means to follow; *dū* means the center; *constant* means the norm. When good and evil are both forgotten and punishment and fame both abandoned, one can follow the Way of the single center, abide in the true and constant virtue, empty and yielding, moving with the world. The subtlety of nurturing life lies herein.

One can preserve the body, one can fulfill life, one can nurture one’s kin,
*[Annotation]* Nurture kin with harmony.
and one can live out one’s years.
*[Annotation]* If one attains the center and moves in profound measure, then nothing is impossible. Nurturing life does not seek to exceed one’s measure but only to fulfill the principle and live out one’s years.

*[Commentary]* Only one who skillfully relinquishes the two extremes and abides in the single center can preserve the body and fulfill the Way of life. Externally, one can filially nurture parents and perfectly accord with human relations; internally, one can safeguard the spirit and fulfill one’s heavenly mandate.

Cook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui. Where his hand touched, where his shoulder leaned, where his foot trod, where his knee pressed—*shū*! *xiàng*!—the blade sounded *luò*!
*[Commentary]* Cook Ding refers to the kitchen servant, the one who prepares meals today. Alternatively, Ding is his name. Lord Wenhui is Lord Hui of Liang. *Carved* means to butcher. *Qí* means to thrust with the lower horn. The text says that Cook Ding, skilled at butchering oxen, saw their natural patterns. Thus, with his hand he grasped, with his shoulder he leaned, with his foot he trod, with his knee he pressed, causing flesh and skin to separate. *Shē*! *xiàng*!—the sounds responded. Advancing the phoenix knife, *luò*!—the great carving was complete. This is an allegory of Cook Ding to illustrate the flourishing of nurturing life.

Every sound was in tune, harmonizing with the dance of *Sanglin* and matching the rhythm of *Jingshou*.
*[Annotation]* His actions, following convenience and applying skill, were all effortlessly masterful. So perfect was his accord with principle that he both followed the ox’s patterns and matched the musical notes.
*[Commentary]* *Sanglin* is the name of a Shang Tang dance. *Jingshou* is the name of a chapter of the *Xianchi* music, the music of Yao. Cook Ding’s spirit was at ease, and he masterfully followed the ox’s patterns. Then, the sounds of his carving harmonized with elegant tones, so that his music matched *Sanglin* and his rhythm accorded with *Jingshou*.

Lord Wenhui said, "Ah! Excellent! How has your skill reached such heights?"

The exclamation "Ah!" is an expression of admiration. Having witnessed Cook Ding apply his skill with such ease, produce harmonious rhythms, and align so perfectly with the musical compositions, Lord Wenhui praised how his mastery had reached such heights.

Cook Ding set down his knife and replied, "What your servant delights in is the Dao, which surpasses mere skill."

*[Annotation]* He merely lodged the principle within his skill—what he truly delighted in was not the skill itself.

*[Commentary]* Setting aside his ornate blade, he answered by expounding the Dao of nurturing life, thus elevating his craft to present to his lord. Another interpretation: "surpasses" means "goes beyond." What he delights in is the Dao of nurturing life, which transcends the skill of butchering an ox.

"When I first began butchering oxen, all I saw was the ox itself."

*[Annotation]* He had yet to perceive the patterns within.

*[Commentary]* At the outset of learning his trade, he had not yet discerned the underlying principles, so all he beheld was the ox. This is akin to one who first embarks on nurturing life, unable to perceive the true realm, and thus encounters obstacles at every turn.

"After three years, I no longer saw the ox as a whole."

*[Annotation]* He now saw only the patterns within.

*[Commentary]* Having wielded the knife for some time, he frequently perceived the spaces between the patterns, so that upon glimpsing the ox, he already knew how to render it empty. This is like one who has cultivated the Dao for many days, whose wisdom gradually brightens, seeing all worldly phenomena as illusory.

"Now, I encounter it with my spirit rather than with my eyes."

*[Annotation]* He merges with and meets the principle.

*[Commentary]* "Encounter" means "to meet." For nineteen years, he has harmonized with the subtle numbers of yin and yang, guiding his spirit to unite with the principle—how could he rely on his eyes to see? This is like one who has mastered the Dao, whose profound accord with the ultimate transcends the need to engage the senses to grasp the dust of the world.

"My senses cease, and my spirit moves as it wills."

*[Annotation]* The faculties of perception are stilled, and the mind flows freely in accord with the principle.

*[Commentary]* "Faculties" refer to the governing senses—such as the eyes, which perceive form, or the ears, which perceive sound. Having encountered the ox with his spirit and no longer relying on his eyes, all such governing senses are stilled. His mind moves as it wills, flowing in accord with the principle. The same holds true for one who skillfully nurtures life.

"I follow the natural patterns." *[Annotation]* Without arbitrary severance.

The skill lies in following the inherent excellence of natural patterns, never arbitrarily severing to harm the ox. Likewise, the subtle Dao of nurturing life adheres to the bounds of nature, never demanding premature death from the living.

"Strike at the great gaps,"
*[Annotation]* At the junctures, strike to part them.
*[Commentary]* At the points where adjacent parts meet, apply force to separate them, causing sinews and bones to diverge. This is like one who studies the Dao, at the junctures of life and death or poverty and prosperity, employing mindful observation to attain liberation.

"Guide through the great cavities,"
*[Annotation]* Where joints open into hollows, guide the blade to keep them distinct.
*[Commentary]* *Qiào* means hollow. At the hollows between bones and joints, thrust and guide the blade to maintain separation. This is like the practitioner who, with the emptiness of resources, guides the fullness of being.

"Proceed from what is inherently so."
*[Annotation]* The blade is never applied arbitrarily.
*[Commentary]* Only after finding the gaps to strike does one wield the knife, just as one relies on what the eyes see and ears hear, never applying the blade arbitrarily.

"Never once has it encountered the tangles of flesh or the snares of sinew,"
*[Annotation]* The marvel of the skill lies in constantly moving the blade through emptiness, never once meeting even the slightest obstruction.
"how much less the great bones?"
*[Annotation]* *Wèi* refers to the largest joints, where the blade would bind.
*[Commentary]* *Kěn yíng* refers to where flesh adheres to bone; *wèi*, to the great bones. The marvel of the skill lies in moving the blade through emptiness, never once encountering even the slightest obstruction—how much less the great bones? Likewise, in nurturing life and wielding wisdom, one subtly embodies true emptiness; even minor delusions do not stain the mind, so how could gross dust burden one’s virtue?

"A good butcher changes his knife once a year—because he cuts."
*[Annotation]* He does not cleave along the natural divisions.
*[Commentary]* Even a skilled butcher, failing to cleave along the natural divisions, must replace his knife after a year. How much more so for one who has not yet embodied the true Dao, grasping at emptiness while clinging to being, whose mind is easily swayed?

"A mediocre butcher changes his knife every month—because he hacks."
*[Annotation]* He strikes bone and breaks the blade.
*[Commentary]* How much more so for the coarse and unrefined, whose spirit is obstructed and dull, encountering every circumstance as an obstacle, thereby harming wisdom and injuring the spirit?

"For nineteen years, my blade has remained in use, having dissected thousands of oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted from the grindstone."
*[Annotation]* *Xíng* refers to a whetstone.
*[Commentary]* *Xíng* is a sharpening stone. Nine is the number of yang; ten, the number of yin.

Thus, nineteen years represent the ultimate subtlety of yin and yang. For this reason, after nineteen years and thousands of oxen dissected, moving through emptiness and traversing the void without dulling the blade’s edge, his knife remains as keen as if freshly whetted. How much more so for one who nurtures life well, whose wisdom penetrates emptiness and being, who harmonizes his light with the world and exhausts the mysteries of yin and yang? Though myriad transformations unfold, he ever renews his virtue; though he traverses ten thousand realms, he remains serene and undisturbed.

Those joints possess spaces, while the blade’s edge has no thickness. With no thickness entering into spaces, how vast is the room for the blade to move! *[Commentary]* The ox’s bones and joints naturally contain gaps, while the blade’s edge is sharp and thin, possessing no thickness. Using a blade without thickness to enter the ox’s gaps, the movement of the knife is thus expansive, leaving ample room. How much more so for the adept who nurtures life, the one who embodies the Dao, who wields the wondrous wisdom of forgetting the utmost and roams the boundless realm of things? Thus, he arranges and adapts with ease, ever at leisure, while realm and wisdom merge, neither one nor different. Therefore, after nineteen years, the blade’s edge remains as if newly sharpened. *[Commentary]* Reiterating the preceding text to conclude its meaning.

Yet whenever I encounter the dense clusters, I perceive the difficulty. *[Annotation]* "Dense clusters" refers to where sinews and bones intertwine. I pause in caution, my gaze fixed, *[Annotation]* No longer directing my eyes elsewhere. my movements slow. *[Annotation]* My hand moves deliberately. *[Commentary]* Where the joints and bones are densely entangled is called a "cluster." Though the blade moves through emptiness and I skillfully discern its retreat, whenever I reach these tangled knots, I cannot but attend to the challenge with care, remaining vigilant and deliberate, my focus unwavering and my hand unhurried. How much more so for one who embodies the Dao: though he comprehends the illusory nature of all things, when realm and wisdom intersect, he must remain cautious and deliberate, lest he lightly taint the roots and dust, disturbing the tranquility.

With the slightest effort, the ox falls apart, *[Annotation]* When the proper method is found, little force is needed. like earth crumbling to the ground. *[Annotation]* The dismemberment occurs without the knife’s advance, as if soil scattering. *[Commentary]* *Dié* (谍) is pronounced with a hundred inflections. *Diéran* refers to the sound of bones and flesh separating. The movement of the phoenix knife is exquisitely subtle, guided by Heaven’s principle, so the task is effortless—like earth scattering to the ground, leaving no trace. How much more so when wielding spirit and wisdom, illuminating the finest subtleties, traversing the dusty realm without the slightest obstruction, where realm and wisdom merge and subject and object dissolve?

Standing with the knife raised, I look around, filled with satisfaction. *[Annotation]* This describes a leisurely and self-contented demeanor. *[Commentary]* Having completed the task of dissecting the ox, I stand at ease, holding the phoenix knife, lingering in contemplation. Then, with an air of refined detachment, I survey the four directions, my spirit full and my heart brimming with self-assurance. The principle of nurturing life is likewise. I then wipe the knife clean and store it away. *[Annotation]* To clean the knife and put it away. *[Commentary]* Preserving it well, I wipe and sheath it. How much more so for one who skillfully nurtures life: he shines without dazzling.

Prince Wenhui said: "Excellent! From the words of Cook Ding, I have learned how to nurture life." *[Annotation]* Since the knife can be nurtured, so too can life. *[Commentary]* Marquis Wen heard Cook Ding’s words and awakened to the Dao of nurturing life. Delighted by its spiritual wonder, he exclaimed, "Excellent!"

Gongwen Xuan saw the Right Minister and was startled, asking: "Who is this man? Why is he limping?" *[Annotation]* *Jie* refers to a partial amputation. *[Commentary]* Gongwen was his surname, Xuan his given name, a man of Song. "Right Minister" was his official title. *Jie* means amputation. Gongwen, seeing the Right Minister’s missing foot, was startled and asked how he came to be so maimed—what offense had he committed to suffer such a loss? Was it fate, or was it man?" *[Annotation]* What cannot be helped is fate; what violates one’s knowledge is man. *[Commentary]* Was this decreed by Heaven, or did he lack a foot from birth? Or was it due to human affairs that he suffered this mutilation? Was this Gongwen’s question?

The reply came: "It is Heaven, not man. Heaven’s creation made him solitary." *[Annotation]* To be partially amputated is called "solitary." If one’s knowledge is limited to a single household and cannot preserve both feet, then knowledge is powerless to help. If the Right Minister’s knowledge sought to keep both feet whole, his spirit would be inwardly exhausted and his body outwardly ruined—how could it be merely a partial amputation? *[Commentary]* The clarity of wisdom and the wholeness of form are both bestowed by Heaven, not a matter of human affairs. Even if he had violated royal law and suffered this mutilation, it would still be due to Heaven’s creation of his stubborn ignorance, insufficient to protect himself. To attribute the loss of his foot to human action while ignoring Heaven’s role in shaping his wisdom is to recognize that having or lacking is a matter of fate.

"Man’s appearance is likewise bestowed."

[Annotation] "Having both feet to walk" is called *having both*. One who possesses such an appearance does not doubt that it is a matter of fate. From this we know that it is Heaven’s doing, not man’s.

[Annotation] Since *having both* is a matter of fate, we know that *lacking one* is likewise not of my own doing. Thus, one who understands the nature of life does not strive for what life cannot achieve; one who understands the nature of fate does not contend with what fate cannot alter—one simply preserves what is natural.

[Subcommentary] *Having both* means sharing. All people’s appearances, including having two feet to walk, are bestowed by the Creator. Thus we know that if one foot suffers this mutilation, it is likewise nothing but fate. This clarifies that success or failure, adversity or prosperity, foolishness or wisdom, wholeness or impairment—all are determined by hidden omens, not by human skill or clumsiness. Only those who grasp this principle can preserve life in its fullness.

The marsh pheasant takes ten steps to peck, a hundred steps to drink, yet does not seek to be fed in a cage.

[Annotation] *Seek* means to pursue; *cage* is what confines the pheasant. To move freely between Heaven and Earth, to roam in the realm of self-contentment—this is the sublime art of nurturing life. Why then seek to enter a cage and submit to domestication?

[Subcommentary] *Seek* means to pursue; *cage* refers to the pheasant’s pen. The marsh pheasant, following its wild nature, drinks and pecks at will, roaming freely and unfettered. How could it desire to enter a cage and be tamed? This is like one who nurtures life, dwelling in serene seclusion, finding joy only in the rustling of the forest—how could they envy worldly glory?

[Another interpretation:] The *ze* resembles a pheasant but is not one; the *ze* has a long tail while the pheasant’s is short—this refers to the *ze-pheasant*.

Though its spirit reigns supreme, it is not *good*.

[Annotation] One who begins with contentment and never ceases to be content has forgotten contentment. The pheasant’s spirit reigns supreme, its will and qi overflowing with ease, freely roaming the clear and boundless wilds. Suddenly, it does not recognize *good* as good.

[Subcommentary] The pheasant dwells in the mountains and marshes, drinking and pecking at will, its spirit reigning supreme, its will and qi brimming with joy. At such moments, it suddenly does not recognize *good* as good. Only when confined to a cage, its nature and emotions unfulfilled, does it reflect on the past and find it exceedingly carefree. If even a bird is thus, how much more so for humans? This illustrates that supreme contentment forgets contentment, and supreme goodness forgets goodness.

When Lao Dan died, Qin Shi mourned him, wailing three times before departing.

[Annotation] Where others mourn, he mourns; where others wail, he wails.

[Subcommentary] Lao Jun is Laozi, surnamed Li, named Er, styled Boyang, and also known as Lao Dan—a great sage born in Ku County of Chen State. During the reign of King Ping of Zhou, he left the Zhou court, crossed the western desert, and journeyed to the land of the barbarians. Though no records of his life appear in the inner and outer classics, this text alone speaks of his death, intending to show that the principles of life and death are ultimately one, and that the Way of the sage is equal in all things. This is but a parable of Zhuangzi’s, for Lao Jun is the ancestor of the Great Dao, the origin of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things—how could he have life and death? Thus, he borrows this tale to illustrate that even sages undergo life and death, clarifying the principle of life and death. Lao Jun’s descent, life, and ascent to Heaven are fully recorded in the *Twelve Classics*, but they are not elaborated here.

Qin Shi, surnamed Qin and named Shi, was a scholar of the Dao, though his origins are unknown. Upon Laozi’s death, he mourned him, wailing three times before departing. Though he lowered himself to act as an ordinary mourner, his duty fulfilled, he left.

The disciple said: "Was he not your friend?"
*(Note: Surprised that he did not merely stand by the door to observe the transformation but instead wailed three times.)*
*(Commentary: Qin Shi and Lord Lao both wandered beyond the world. To wail and mourn—could this be called lofty? Thus, the disciple, startled and doubtful, asked if he was not a friend.)*

He replied: "Yes."
*(Commentary: "Yes" means "it is so." Qin Shi answered the disciple, saying he was a friend from beyond the world.)*

The disciple asked: "Then is it proper to mourn him in this way?"
*(Commentary: For one beyond the world to perform the rites of the mundane, wailing and mourning thus—is this reasonable? Not yet understanding the harmony of light, he pressed further with this question.)*

He replied: "Yes."
*(Note: The perfected one is without emotion; he merely joined the crowd in wailing. Thus, it is permissible.)*
*(Commentary: "Yes" means "it is permissible." Profound stillness and responsiveness are inwardly and outwardly in perfect accord, so it is fitting.)*

"At first, I thought he was one of your followers, but now I see he is not.
When I entered to offer my condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for a son, and the young weeping for him as if for a mother.
Those who gathered must have been moved by words not sought, by weeping not contrived."
*(Note: He suspected they had bestowed favors before the fact, not abiding in principle, thus leading to such excessive attachment.)*
*(Commentary: "Sought" means "deliberately pursued." "Those" refers to the crowd. The sage, with an empty heart, responds to the feelings of all things. Pitying the multitudes and grieving for the people, he expounds the Dao without waiting to be asked. Thus, when he died, the people gathered, wailing and mourning as if for a parent or child. This is the clinging of ordinary emotions, the delusion of life and death, stirred by the sage’s kindness to such sorrow. Judging by this, I knew they were not Lord Lao’s disciples.)*

"This is fleeing from Heaven and doubling one’s emotions, forgetting what one has received."
*(Note: The nature one receives from Heaven has its own proper measure; it cannot be escaped, nor can it be added to.)*
*(Commentary: "This" refers to those who wept. "Doubling" means "adding." To flee from one’s natural endowment and amplify worldly emotions, mistakenly seeing death as something to grieve—this is to forget the measure one has received.)*

"The ancients called this the punishment of fleeing from Heaven."
*(Note: To be so deeply moved by things as to exceed what is proper is to flee from Heaven. Racing into the realm of sorrow and joy, though no physical punishment is applied, one’s nature and emotions are already exhausted—is this not a punishment?)*
*(Commentary: To flee from Heaven’s principle and amplify worldly emotions, to be consumed by sorrow and joy, to torment the heart and spirit as if by flogging—is this not a punishment? The enlightened of old spoke thus.)*

"To come is the Master’s time;
*(Note: Time arises of itself.)*
to go is the Master’s compliance.
*(Note: Death is the natural principle.)*
*(Commentary: "The Master" refers to Lord Lao. Qin Shi, knowing Lord Lao was a great sage who profoundly understood the source, said that his timely birth was in accord with the moment, and his tranquil departure was in compliance with principle, returning to the true.)*

"Abiding in time and complying with principle, neither sorrow nor joy can enter.
*(Note: Sorrow and joy arise from loss and gain. Now, the one who is spiritually attuned and harmonized with change is at peace in every moment, in every circumstance. Mysteriously one with the transformations of creation, there is nowhere that is not oneself—what gain or loss, what life or death could there be? Thus, following what one has received, sorrow and joy have no place to intervene.)*
*(Commentary: Content with life, one does not resent living; compliant with death, one does not abhor dying. In the myriad changes, nothing is not oneself. Wherever one goes, one is at ease—thus sorrow and joy have no place in the heart.)*

"The ancients called this the celestial release."
*(Note: To take the bound as "suspended" is to see the unbound as "released." Released, the emotions of life and destiny are attained. This is the essence of nurturing life.)*
*(Commentary: "Celestial" means "Heaven." To be bound by life and death is to be suspended; to be free of life and death is to be released. For one whom life and death cannot bind, whom sorrow and joy cannot enter—the sages of remote antiquity called this the natural release. Yet Lord Lao, the great sage, was one with life and death—how could he flee from the punishment of fleeing Heaven or rush into sorrow and joy? Master Xuan’s note here misses the mark by far. If so, what does it mean to abide in time and comply with principle, to attain the celestial release? The argument turns back on itself. Thus, the punishment of fleeing Heaven belongs to those who grieve excessively, not to Lord Lao.)*

"When the finger is exhausted in pointing to the firewood, the fire is transmitted.
*(Note: "Exhausted" means "ended"; "firewood" refers to the preceding fuel. When the finger points to the principle of the preceding firewood, the fire is transmitted and does not expire. When the heart abides in the midst of nurturing, life continues without end. This clarifies that nurturing life is the very means by which life is sustained.)*
*(Commentary: "Exhausted" means "ended." "Firewood" means "fuel." "Pointing" means "preceding." When one kindles a fire, using the preceding fuel, one who fully understands the principle of kindling will ensure that even as the preceding fuel is consumed, the following fuel continues it, passing the flame from one to the next so that the fire does not expire. This is like one who skillfully nurtures life, flowing with change, moving with things, renewing oneself without attachment—nothing is not oneself, so life continues without end.)*

"One does not know its end.
*(Note: Time does not return, the present does not pause—thus, for a person’s life, each breath is a single attainment. The last breath is not the present breath; thus, by nurturing, life continues.)*

The preceding fire is not the subsequent fire, thus the fire is transmitted through the fuel, and as the fire is transmitted, life continues—this arises from nurturing to its utmost. How could the world know that as one ends, another is born?

*(Commentary: The deluded and forgetful, bound by their emotions and attachments, how could they know that the new is ever-unceasing, thought after thought flowing onward? Yesterday’s self is already exhausted in today, and today’s self is reborn in what follows. Formerly, this chapter was divided into seven sections to clarify its meaning, but upon examining its textual flow, such division proved overly cumbersome. Now, I have merged "For Goodness" with the first section and "Pointing to Exhaustion" with "Lord Lao," consolidating the whole into five chapters, leaving no room for doubt or ambiguity.)*

The Tang-era Master of Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying’s Subcommentary
*Inner Chapters, "In the Human World" (Chapter Four)*

To dwell among people is to be inseparable from them. Yet the vicissitudes of human affairs vary across ages, and only those who are without fixed intent and do not impose their own will can adapt to change as it arises without bearing its burdens.

Yan Hui sought out Confucius and requested leave to travel.
**[Subcommentary]** His surname was Yan, given name Hui, courtesy name Ziyuan, a native of Lu. Among Confucius’ three thousand disciples, he was one of the foremost, admitted to the inner chamber across the four categories of instruction. As for Zhongni: his surname was Kong, given name Qiu, courtesy name Zhongni, also a native of Lu, a descendant of the Yin sovereign Tang. Born in the declining Zhou era, he possessed sagely virtue and was the teacher of Yan Hui. The roots of their deeds lie in the Confucian tradition, but since this is an explication of the *Zhuangzi*, our intent lies in the profound and subtle. Thus, we shall not belabor the details here.

Yet the threads of human affairs are tangled and fraught with difficulty. To engage with others for their benefit is a principle not easily mastered. Therefore, the text invokes Yan and Kong to reveal the method of transformation and guidance, entrusting these sages to clarify the safeguarding of the fasting of the mind.

The sagely Kong and the worthy Yan—
Confucius asked, “Where are you bound?”
**[Subcommentary]** *Xi* means “what”; *zhi* means “to go.” The question inquires where Yan Hui intends to travel.
Yan Hui replied, “I will go to Wei.”
**[Subcommentary]** Wei was the capital of King Zhou of Yin and later the fief of Kang Shu. Today, it corresponds to Weizhou in Jijun. Here, Yan answers Confucius’ question regarding his destination.
Confucius asked, “What will you do there?”
**[Subcommentary]** What purpose does he have in going to the state of Wei? The question presses Yan Hui further on the intent behind his journey.
Yan Hui replied, “I have heard that the Lord of Wei is in his prime, yet his conduct is willful.”
**[Annotation]** He does not share the desires of his people.
**[Subcommentary]** The Lord of Wei refers to Ji Zha, son of Duke Ling. Dissolute and reckless, he indulged in excess without regard for the Dao. Though young and vigorous, his might was fearsome; his actions were violent and defied the will of the people. Yan Hui recounts what he has heard to answer his master.

The ruler treats his state with recklessness.
**[Annotation]** One who governs others must act with caution, for a single outburst of anger may leave corpses strewn and blood flowing, while a moment of pleasure may fill the roads with carriages and caps. Thus, the use of a state by its ruler must never be taken lightly.
**[Subcommentary]** The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is secure, the state enjoys peace. If one fails to cherish and value the common folk, instead treating their use with contempt, how can the state avoid collapse?

And yet he fails to see his own faults.
**[Annotation]** None dare admonish him.
**[Subcommentary]** His strength suffices to reject counsel, his eloquence to gloss over wrongs. Thus, the hundred officials swallow their words in fear, and though his faults abound, none dare reproach him.

He treats the lives of his people as of little worth,
**[Annotation]** He treats them as expendable in matters of life and death.
**[Subcommentary]** Unmoved by stillness or motion, complacent in his ease, he recklessly deploys his people, casting them into the jaws of death.

The dead are measured by the state as if they were reeds in the marsh,
**[Annotation]** When the entire state is driven to death, their number defies reckoning—they are regarded as mere grass and weeds.
**[Subcommentary]** *Jiao* refers to grass and weeds. Whether through ceaseless campaigns or crushing taxes, the dead are beyond counting. To speak of their number is to measure them by the state itself, for their multitude is too vast to tally in haste. Indulging only himself, he neglects the hundred clans, viewing his people as no more than reeds in a swamp.

The people have nowhere to turn.
**[Annotation]** They have no refuge.
**[Subcommentary]** With a ruler devoid of the Way and ministers suffering famine, they not only find themselves helpless but also have nowhere to flee.

I once heard the Master say: “Flee a well-governed state; go to a disordered one—where there are many illnesses, there is work for a physician.” I wish to apply the principle I have heard, hoping that the state may yet find some relief.
**[Subcommentary]** *Shu* means “to hope,” *ji* means “near.”

"Recovery" means healing. In a well-governed state, peace and tranquility prevail without need of correction or support; but in a disordered land, isolated and imperiled, one must apply tested remedies. Yan now proposes to transform Wei, and so I recount what I once heard, reflecting on the teachings he received, hoping he may draw near to the good Way. Like a physician’s gate where many are cured of illness, so too can a worthy scholar rescue from peril—yet for the malady of wanton excess, there is no recovery.

Confucius said: “Hmph. You will likely go and meet punishment.”
**[Annotation]** His Way is insufficient to save or bring rest.
**[Subcommentary]** *Hmph* is the sound of mocking laughter. *You* means “you.” *Likely* means “near.” Confucius scoffs at his shallow presumption, for he is unfit to transform others. If you go to Wei, you will surely suffer execution.

The Way does not tolerate admixture.
**[Annotation]** It must be rightly embodied in the proper person.
Admixture leads to multiplicity, multiplicity to disorder, disorder to distress, and distress cannot be remedied.
**[Annotation]** If the proper person is not found, even a hundred physicians attending the patient will only deepen doubt and fail to bring a single cure.
**[Subcommentary]** The numinous Way resides in purity alone. If it is adulterated, affairs multiply; multiplicity breeds confusion in the heart, and confusion gives rise to distress. When medicine and malady clash, both patient and healer are exhausted. If one cannot even establish oneself, how can one save others? The perfected of old first stabilized themselves before stabilizing others.
**[Annotation]** Only with the requisite capacity can one engage with the world.
**[Subcommentary]** *Zhu* means “in.” *Cun* means “to establish.” The supremely virtuous of antiquity, advancing with empty minds into the world, first secured their own Way before rescuing others. There has never been one whose own self was unestablished who could yet engage with things. This is cited from the ancients as a mirror and warning. If what is established in oneself remains unsettled, how can one presume to reach the conduct of a violent ruler?
**[Annotation]** One who does not respond to things with an empty mind but expends thought in reckless confrontation shows that what is established in oneself is not yet settled.
Only by externalizing knowledge to nurture the true, entrusting subtlety to the talents of the many, ascribing merit to things while quieting cares and distancing the self, can one then attain the conduct of a violent ruler.
**[Subcommentary]** Only one who responds to affairs with an empty mind, forgets knowledge to nurture the true, entrusts rightness to the many, and ascribes merit to the myriad things may then enter the human realm, adapt to its currents, and act to transform it. Now Yan Hui’s self-cultivation is not yet secure; right and wrong, joy and anger surge within his breast. What leisure has he to rush to Wei and admonish a violent ruler? This course is not yet viable.

Moreover, do you know whence virtue is swept away and knowledge arises?"

Virtue is swept away by fame, and knowledge arises from contention.
**[Annotation]** The reason virtue flows away and dissipates is the pride taken in fame; the reason knowledge spreads recklessly is the struggle to be deemed good. Even if one were as ruined as Jie, what they cherish and cling to is nothing but the name of goodness.

**[Subcommentary]** Do you even know the source from which virtue is swept away and knowledge arises? Virtue flows away and loses its truth because of pride in fame; knowledge spreads recklessly and exceeds its bounds because of contention over goodness. Only one who forgets both good and evil, relinquishing both name and reality, can ensure that the myriad virtues do not dissipate and that ultimate knowledge does not arise. Fame is that by which people clash; knowledge is the instrument of contention. These two are instruments of misfortune and cannot be fully enacted.

**[Annotation]** Fame and knowledge are what the world employs. Yet when fame arises, people clash; when knowledge is used, contention flourishes. Only by relinquishing fame and knowledge can conduct be fully realized.

**[Subcommentary]** To take pride in fame is to invite mutual harm; to display knowledge is to spark contention on the path. Thus, these two are both instruments of calamity and cannot be enacted in the world. Moreover, though virtue is profound and trustworthiness evident, one has not yet reached the qi of others; though one’s reputation is renowned and free of contention, one has not yet reached the hearts of others.

**[Subcommentary]** *Qiang* means "truly." Suppose one’s virtue is pure and profound, one’s conduct truly steadfast, one’s reputation fragrant and renowned, and one does not contend with others—yet the ruler of Wei, by nature stubborn and foolish, cruel and lacking discernment, neither grasps Yan Hui’s qi nor recognizes his intent to rectify. To forcefully present the language of benevolence and righteousness, the inked line of the carpenter’s square, before such a violent ruler is to impose one’s beauty where others despise it.

**[Annotation]** To offer a night-shining pearl to another is rarely met without a hand on the sword, for they do not comprehend it. Yan Hui’s virtue and trustworthiness, along with his reputation free of contention, are things the ruler of Wei does not grasp. To forcefully apply the measuring line of the Seven Virtues to him would lead him to believe that Yan Hui seeks to destroy others to establish himself. Thus, the perfected person does not exert their will to order the world but responds to things with an empty mind. Sincerity and trustworthiness manifest in heaven and earth; non-contention flows freely among the myriad things. Only then do the myriad things return to embrace them, heaven and earth do not oppose them, their virtuous voice issues forth and the world resonates in harmony, their illustrious conduct shines and the six directions all respond. Only then can one endure cold and heat, traverse order and chaos, without ever encountering the reverse scales.

**[Subcommentary]** The language of the carpenter’s square refers to the sagely wisdom of the Five Virtues. The ruler of Wei does not grasp Yan Hui’s inner virtue, yet he forcefully deploys the conduct of benevolence and righteousness before a violent ruler. The fine words of former kings he presents will only incur the ruler’s resentment and aversion—thus, it cannot be done. This is called "the old man." Where there is an old man, people will surely turn against the shoots.

**[Annotation]** If one’s words are not trusted and received, others will assume they are contending for fame and thus turn to harm them.

**[Subcommentary]** *Ming* means "to name." The ruler of Wei does not grasp your heart and will assume you seek to harm him. Once suspicion arises, you will be met with opposition and harm. You would be perilously close to becoming a target for others. Moreover, if one merely delights in the worthy and despises the unworthy, what need is there to seek something different?

**[Annotation]** If one can delight in the worthy and despise the foolish, heeding righteousness and submitting to it, then one is already a enlightened ruler. If one is an enlightened ruler, then one does not need worthy ministers—your going would not be particularly remarkable. If this is not the case, going would only bring harm. Thus, to go with intention is to find no path that is viable; to respond without intention is to have blessings come of their own accord—then there is no path that is not viable.

**[Subcommentary]** *Dai* means "near"; *fu* means "to deceive." If you go to Wei, you will be near peril and destruction, harmed by the violent ruler—this is deeply deceptive. Moreover, if the ruler of Wei could delight in worthy men and despise the unworthy, then his court would be filled with gentlemen, petty men would be cast aside, and he would already have loyal ministers—what need would he have for you? In going to him, how would you be different from others? Since you would be no different, your departure would be of no benefit. If you remain utterly silent, the king and duke will surely exploit their position to vie for victory.

**[Annotation]** You must remain utterly silent; if you speak, the king and duke will exploit their lordly authority to compete for victory, using clever words to adorn their wrongdoing.

**[Subcommentary]** *Zhao* means "speech." *Wang gong* refers to the ruler of Wei. If you go to Wei, you should remain silent; if you offer admonitions, you will suffer humiliation. Moreover, the ruler of Wei relies on the power of a thousand chariots and the might of the five ranks, adorning his wrongs and rejecting remonstrance, sharpening his cleverness and eloquence. Overcome with fear, how would you have the leisure to rectify him? His eyes will be dazzled,

**[Annotation]** His words are so clever and quick that they dazzle the eyes.

**[Subcommentary]** *Ying* means "to dazzle." Though the ruler of Wei is dissolute and violent, he is exceedingly clever and eloquent. Relying on the authority of a ruler, he oppresses and tramples loyal remonstrators, so that Yan Hui’s heart fills with terror and his eyes become dazzled. His countenance will be leveled,

**[Annotation]** He will no longer be able to distinguish himself from others.

Though one may have a refined heart, one dare not display distinction, and one’s countenance becomes meek and compliant, harmonizing with the other in peace.

The mouth will be occupied with self-preservation,
**[Annotation]** There is no leisure for self-explanation.
**[Subcommentary]** As the lord of Wei holds high rank and awe-inspiring majesty, Yan fears disaster may befall him and is beset by a hundred anxieties. Thus, his tongue is wholly engaged in self-preservation, leaving no moment of respite.

The bearing will manifest compliance,
**[Subcommentary]** *Xing* means "to appear." Fearing calamity, he yields in outward submission, striking his cheeks and bending his fists, his form and demeanor revealing such compliance.

The heart will even come to embrace it.
**[Annotation]** He will then set aside his own convictions to follow the other.
**[Subcommentary]** Not only does his outward form comply, but his inner heart also aligns, unable to advance goodness and instead furthering the other’s wrongdoing. Thus, it is like using fire to fight fire, or water to fight water—what is called "increasing the excess."

**[Annotation]** Such efforts fail to remedy the situation and instead only serve to amplify the other’s dominance.
**[Subcommentary]** *Yi* means "to employ." Employing fire to fight fire only intensifies the blaze; employing water to fight water only worsens the waves. Thus, Yanzi’s conduct merely abets the lord of Wei’s tyranny, failing to correct or admonish him—truly an "increase of excess." Compliance at the outset knows no end,

**[Annotation]** Clinging to the usual and refusing to change.
If, in peril, one offers earnest words without first establishing trust, one will surely die before the violent ruler.
**[Annotation]** Without trust, even earnestness brings harm.
**[Subcommentary]** Your earnest and sincere counsel, if not first trusted, will—though offered with utmost loyalty—only result in execution before the brutal ruler. Moreover, in ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan. Both were men who cultivated their conduct to serve the people beneath the pivot of governance, yet they defied their superiors.

**[Annotation]** Taking on the ruler’s burdens while below—Bigan’s case was not his proper duty.

The *yù* method: a ruler who slays many people and plunders the people is called Jie; one who ruins righteousness and harms goodness is called Zhou. Guan was his surname, Longfeng his courtesy name—a worthy minister of Jie of Xia, who, though utterly sincere, met with beheading. Bigan, a paternal uncle of Zhou of Yin, who remonstrated in loyalty, had his heart cut out. *Yǎnbàn* means to nurture and foster. *Fú* means to defy or oppose.

These two men, both excellent ministers of ancient times, cultivated and adorned their persons, practiced loyalty and integrity in secret, and from their position as subjects, took on the burdens of the ruler’s people. Though the ministers possessed virtue, the rulers were without the Way; defying their rulers, both suffered execution and disgrace. Citing the past to prove the present, they serve as a mirror and warning. From this, we know that Yan Hui’s attempt to transform Wei could not succeed. Thus, its ruler, seizing upon their cultivation, cast them aside—these were men who coveted reputation.

**[Annotation]** He did not wish for his ministers to gain a reputation surpassing his own.

**[Subcommentary]** *Jǐ* means to cast down, to ensnare, to poison. Jie of Xia and Zhou of Yin, rulers without the Way, failed to measure themselves and still demanded praise and renown. Thus, they seized upon the cultivation of worthy ministers and wantonly poisoned them. Their intent lay in contending for fame and profit, and so they came to this end.

In ancient times, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu’ao, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became desolate ruins, their persons met with execution and punishment. Their use of arms did not cease, their pursuit of substance knew no end. These were all men who sought fame and substance—have you alone not heard of this?

**[Annotation]** Brutal rulers not only seek to indulge their desires but also pursue fame; it is only that what they seek is not by the proper Way.

**[Subcommentary]** The two rulers Yao and Yu have already been explained above. Congzhi, Xu’ao, and Youhu are all names of states. Youhu is present-day Huo County in Yongzhou. A dwelling without people is called a ruin; a ghost without descendants is called a wraith. These three rulers were all without the Way, fond of waging war and invading other states. Not only did they demand substantial profit, but they also sought empty fame, so that their territories became barren wastes, their people exterminated, their persons met with execution, and their ancestral temples overthrown. The pursuit of fame and substance led to this extremity—this is known to all, past and present; have you alone not heard of it?

Fame and substance are things even the sages cannot overcome—how much less can one such as you?

**[Annotation]** Rulers who crave reputation and indulge their desires, even if they were Yao or Yu, could not be transformed; thus, they assembled armies to attack them. How then could you, Yanzi, go empty-handed to transform them with the Way?

**[Subcommentary]** Ordinary men and violent kings, who demand profit and seek fame, even the sage-kings Yao and Yu could not win over with virtue and instead raised armies to punish their crimes and eliminate their evil. How much less could Yanzi, a common man, go empty-handed to transform them? There is no doubt that this is impossible.

Nevertheless, if you must have some means, try telling it to me.

**[Subcommentary]** *Cháng* means to attempt. Though your transformative guidance may not yet be expansive, since you wish to go, you must have some basis. Try setting forth your intent and telling it to me.

Yan Hui said: Upright yet empty—

**[Annotation]** To rectify one’s form and empty one’s mind.

**[Subcommentary]** To rectify one’s form is to fulfill the reverence of a subject; to empty one’s mind and thoughts is to exhaust the sincerity of remediation.

Having received your lofty command, how dare I be confused about the means?

Earnest and single-minded—

**[Annotation]** To be yielding yet unwavering.

**[Subcommentary]** To exert one’s body and mind, to devote oneself wholly to the state, to speak and act with loyalty and sincerity, never deviating in the slightest.

—would this suffice?

**[Subcommentary]** Following these two principles, could this be put into practice or not?

The Master said: How could it? How could it suffice?

**[Annotation]** This means it is not yet sufficient.

**[Subcommentary]** *Wū è* means "in what way." In what way could it suffice? It means it is not yet sufficient.

For one whose yang is full to the utmost and widely displayed—

**[Annotation]** The ruler of Wei’s overbearing yang nature is replete within and greatly manifested without—this is the height of strength and arrogance.

**[Subcommentary]** *Yáng* means firm and fierce. *Chōng* means full; *kǒng*, extreme. The ruler of Wei’s firm and fierce nature fills his heart, and his violence is extreme, manifesting outwardly.

Whose colors are unsettled—

**[Annotation]** His joy and anger are without constancy.

**[Subcommentary]** When things go his way, he is pleased; when they do not, he rages. His spirit, countenance, and qi show no fixed standard.

Such a one as even ordinary people dare not oppose—

**[Annotation]** None dare go against him.

**[Subcommentary]** His nature is violent and cruel, his might and ferocity constant. Even skilled knights and worthy men cannot oppose him.

And who, seizing upon what moves others, seeks to indulge his own heart—

**[Annotation]** One so stubborn and overbearing that when others move him with pleasing matters, he tramples and humiliates them, seeking ease and self-indulgence to satisfy his extravagant desires.

**[Subcommentary]** *Àn* means to suppress. *Róngyǔ* means to be unrestrained. When others move him with good and pleasing remonstrances, the ruler seizes upon their loyal admonitions and suppresses them, seeking pleasure and indulgence to satisfy his dissolute and reckless intentions.

Is said to be one whose daily accumulating virtue does not take shape—how much less could great virtue do so?

**[Annotation]** This means that even a little is too much; there is no way to make him yield.

**[Subcommentary]** The Marquis of Wei has been without the Way for a long time. Even the virtue that accumulates day by day cannot take shape—how much less could the vast and luminous standards of the sage be hoped for?

He will cling to his ways and not be transformed—

**[Annotation]** Thus, he holds to his original intent.

**[Subcommentary]** He adorns his wrongs and agrees with his lord, cannot follow others like flowing water, clings to his original mind—who would change from evil to good?

Outwardly compliant yet inwardly uncritical—how could this possibly suffice?

**[Annotation]** Outwardly compliant yet inwardly uncritical is just what was meant earlier by "upright yet empty" and "earnest and single-minded." This is insufficient to transform him.

**[Subcommentary]** Outwardly, he bows and scrapes to fulfill utmost reverence; inwardly, he submits without daring to criticize.

To propose this for practice—what benefit could there be? The Way of transforming Wei—how could it possibly be spoken of? This is but to reject the earlier "upright yet empty" Wei as unfit for implementation.

Yet if I am inwardly straight but outwardly bent, achieving and ascending to comparison—

**[Annotation]** Yan Hui further speaks of these three principles.

**[Subcommentary]** Having been reproved for the two matters previously set forth, he now offers three principles, hoping they may prove fitting. Here he states the topics; below, he explains their meaning—this is Yan Hui, deluded about himself, questioning Confucius.

"Inwardly straight" means to follow Heaven as one’s companion. To follow Heaven as one’s companion is to know that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven. Should one alone take one’s words as kindling for others’ approval when they are good, or as kindling when they are not?

**[Annotation]** All things, noble or base, share the same source of life. Thus, whether good or not good, one entrusts them to impartial judgment—seeking nothing from others.

**[Subcommentary]** Below, he explains the meaning. 析 means "to seek."

"To say 'inwardly straight' is to maintain a plain and honest heart, joining with the natural principle as one’s kindred. Knowing that the emperor and I both receive our nature from Heaven, one can forget distinctions of noble and base between ruler and subject, dismiss considerations of good and evil in honor and disgrace, and refrain from priding oneself on avoiding wrong or seeking goodness in others. This is emptiness of mind, and it may accord with principle. If so, others will call one a child—this is what it means to join with Heaven as one’s kindred.

**[Annotation]** Following Heaven’s principle, one extends one’s nature and destiny like an infant’s straightforward advance.

**[Subcommentary]** *Ran* means "in this way." *Tongzi* means "infant." If, as described, one extends principle and advances directly, acting like an infant, one is called a child. This completes the previous meaning, and so it is called joining with Heaven as one’s kindred.

"To be 'outwardly compliant' is to join with others as one’s kindred. Raising the chin and bending the fists—these are the rites of a minister. Everyone does them; how dare I not? To do what others do is to incur no fault from them.

**[Subcommentary]** To bend one’s outward form and follow the ways of the world is to join with human relationships as one’s kindred. Raising the hands, touching the chin, bending the knees, bowing the body, lowering and lifting in obeisance—these are the rites of a minister. Yet to harmonize with the dust and grime, adapting to the rise and fall of things, is what everyone does; how could I alone refuse? Thus, doing what others do, one incurs no resentment or blame. This is what it means to join with others as one’s kindred.

**[Annotation]** Outwardly bending one’s form, one follows what human affairs require.

**[Subcommentary]** This completes the above.

"To 'achieve and compare above' is to join with the ancients as one’s kindred.

**[Annotation]** Achieving in the present and comparing with the ancients.

**[Subcommentary]** The affairs of loyal remonstrance are achieved in the present, while the principle of ruler and minister is compared with the ancients. Thus, one joins with the loyal ministers of antiquity, such as Bi Gan and others—this is its meaning. Though one’s words may instruct, they contain reproof in reality.

**[Annotation]** Though it is common instruction, it truly carries the intent of admonition.

**[Subcommentary]** *Zhe* means "reproof." The words of warning, though appearing as instruction, in their intent truly contain a heart of admonition. This has existed since ancient times; it is not something I alone have initiated today. If so, though one is straightforward, one will not be harmed.

**[Annotation]** Entrusting straightness to the ancients, there is nothing by which to harm me.

**[Subcommentary]** If the way of loyal remonstrance has existed since antiquity, and I am now sincere and straightforward, I may also be fortunate enough to avoid trouble. This is what it means to join with the ancients as one’s kindred.

**[Subcommentary]** This completes the previous point.

"Is this acceptable?"

**[Subcommentary]** Presenting these three principles, one does not yet know whether they are acceptable.

Confucius said: "Alas, how can it be? Too much governance, with laws but no coherence.

**[Annotation]** When principle admits no duality, yet one imposes three principles to govern, it does not merge with the matter.

**[Subcommentary]** *Die* means "coherence," "accord." If laws accord with principle, one need not multiply them; to impose three principles is excessively cumbersome. It does not accord with principle and brings no peace or ease—how could it be acceptable? Yet, though rigid, it is also without fault.

**[Annotation]** Though not grand, it also incurs no blame.

**[Subcommentary]** Proposing these three principles, though crude, since they have not yet been put into practice, one may also be fortunate enough to avoid blame. Nevertheless, this is all it is; how can it reach transformation?

**[Annotation]** There is no fault, but there is also no transformation.

**[Subcommentary]** *Hu* means "how." Yan Hui’s transformation of Wei consists only of these methods, sufficient for self-cultivation but not for saving the age—how can it reach transformation? Another explanation: If one stops and does not act, it may accord with principle, but if one goes to Wei, one will surely encounter danger. It is still to follow one’s own mind.

**[Annotation]** Carrying three principles to that place is not to be without mind and entrust it to the world.

**[Subcommentary]** The sage empties himself, responding to the times without mind, like a bright mirror or an empty valley. Now Yan Hui prepares teachings in advance, deliberating whether they may be acceptable—since he is not yet indifferent and detached, it is clear he follows his own mind.

Yan Hui said: "I have nothing further to advance. I venture to ask for its method."

**[Subcommentary]** Yan Hui’s three courses were exhausted in a single morning. The way to transform Wei admits no further advance; he asks the sage teacher, hoping to hear the wondrous method.

Confucius said: "Fast! I will tell you. To have and act upon it—is that easy?

**[Annotation]** To have the mind and act upon it is truly not easy.

**[Subcommentary]** Yan Hui earnestly requests, and the Master speaks of the fasting of the mind. If one can empty and forget, I will tell you. But to have the mind and seek the mysterious Dao is truly not easy.

"To consider it easy is not fitting for the vast sky.

**[Annotation]** To take having and acting as easy is not seen as fitting.

**[Subcommentary]** The *Erya* says: In summer, the sky is *haotian*. It speaks of its vast and expansive qi. To act with the mind of having and consider the Dao easy is not fitting under the vast sky. It is not fitting to have the mind in the fasting of the mind."

Yan Hui said: "My family is poor. For months now, I have not drunk wine or eaten meat. If this is so, can it be considered fasting?"

**[Subcommentary]** *Ru* means "to eat." *Hun* means "pungent vegetables." *Zhai* means "to fast," signifying that both mind and conduct are unstained by the dust of others. Yan Hui’s family is poor; the Confucian histories record this clearly. Without wine to drink or meat to eat, subsisting on a bamboo basket of grain and a gourd of vegetables, this has gone on for months. He asks whether this can be considered fasting.

Confucius said: "This is the fasting for sacrifice, not the fasting of the mind."

The Master [Confucius] replied: "This is the fasting for offering sacrifices to spirits and ancestors, the method of purification practiced among the common folk—it is not what is meant by the fasting of the mind."

Yan Hui said: "May I ask about the fasting of the mind?"

**[Subcommentary]** Earlier, he spoke of his family’s poverty, which required him to perform sacrificial rites. Now he asks for instruction in the method of the fasting of the mind.

Zhongni [Confucius] said: "Unify your will.
**[Annotation]** Abandon all distractions and rely solely on the singular.
**[Subcommentary]** Unify your mind and will, leaving no room for distractions. Enter stillness and emptiness, forgetting all, and obscurely align with solitary transformation. What follows is the Master’s answer to Yan Hui, broadly expounding the method of the fasting of the mind.

Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind.
**[Subcommentary]** Let the ear-root remain empty and still, not clinging to sounds. Turn inward to listen to the soundless, concentrating the spirit in the mind’s abode.

Do not listen with the mind but listen with qi.
**[Subcommentary]** The mind possesses awareness, which still gives rise to conditions; qi is without thought or deliberation, empty and yielding, responsive to things. Thus, abandon the mind’s awareness and embrace this emptiness and yielding. Through repeated relinquishment, one gradually ascends to the mysterious and wondrous.

Listening stops at the ears.
**[Subcommentary]** Not clinging to the dust of sound, listening ceases at the mind. This explains "do not listen with the ears."

The mind stops at alignment.
**[Subcommentary]** *Fu* means "to align." When the mind arises in conditions, it must align with external objects. Strive to make it still and empty, so it no longer aligns with external things. This explains "do not listen with the mind."

Qi is that which is empty and awaits things.
**[Annotation]** Abandon the ears and eyes, discard the mind’s intentions, and entrust oneself to the self-attainment of qi’s nature—this is emptiness awaiting things.
**[Subcommentary]** Like qi, which is soft, weak, and empty, the mind must be still and forgetful to respond to things. This explains "listen with qi."

Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind.
**[Annotation]** Empty the mind, and the supreme Dao will gather within.
**[Subcommentary]** Only the true Dao gathers in the empty mind. Thus, the empty mind is the wondrous Dao of the fasting of the mind.

Yan Hui said: "Before I received this teaching, I was truly myself, Yan Hui.
**[Annotation]** Without the fasting of the mind, one remains attached to the self.
**[Subcommentary]** Without examining the teaching of the fasting of the mind, one still harbors a bounded and obstructed mind. Unable to break the body and forget the self, one still regards Yan Hui as truly existing.

Now that I have received this teaching, there has never been a Yan Hui.
**[Annotation]** Having received the teaching of the fasting of the mind, one is without self.
**[Subcommentary]** Having received the Master’s teaching and been guided to empty the mind, one can thoroughly forget both self and others, so that there has never been a Yan Hui.

Can this be called emptiness?"
The Master said: "It is complete."

"I tell you: You may enter and wander within its bounds, but do not be moved by its name.
**[Annotation]** The realm where the mind is released and self-attained—one should rest in reality.
**[Subcommentary]** The Master speaks of the essentials of transformation and spiritual wandering. Be cautious not to grasp its pivot. Rather, wander within its bounds, concealing your traces and silencing your name, so as not to be moved by fame or wisdom. *Fan* means "bounds."

If you enter, then sing; if you do not enter, then stop.
**[Annotation]** Like the notes of music, response arises without intention—this is called "singing." To respond without intention is to follow the other, not to force a response.
**[Subcommentary]** If your counsel is heeded by the ruler, then you may sing to guide and save him. If your advice is not received, then seal your lips and forget words. To insist on displaying loyalty and integrity will surely invite disaster.

No gate, no governance.
**[Annotation]** Let things be as they are—this is "no gate." Entrust the world to its natural peace—this is "no governance." *Du* means "to govern."
**[Subcommentary]** *Du* means "to govern." Like water or a mirror, respond with an empty mind, not acting in advance.

Dwell in the one and lodge in the inevitable.
**[Annotation]** The inevitable is what is necessarily so in principle. Abide in the dwelling of utmost oneness and meet the alignment of necessity.
**[Subcommentary]** *Zhai* means "dwelling." Abide in the Dao of utmost oneness, responding without ceasing, where stimulus and response obscurely align, without prior calculation.

Then you are near.
**[Annotation]** The principle is exhausted here.
**[Subcommentary]** *Ji* means "near exhaustion." The principle of responding to things is exhausted here.

To sever nearness is easy; to walk without treading the earth is difficult.
**[Annotation]** Not acting is easy; to act without treading the earth is impossible. Non-action is easy; to act without harming one’s nature is unattainable.
**[Subcommentary]** To sit still and sever all paths is not difficult in principle; to walk without treading the earth is thus not easy. Likewise, non-action and emptiness make response easy; deliberate action and thought make engagement with things difficult. The principle is clear, and thus this analogy is apt.

To be employed by man is easy to deceive; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to deceive.
**[Annotation]** What the eyes and ears perceive is coarse, so it is easy to deceive. The response of the natural is subtle, so it is difficult to deceive. Those who lose little of the real lose little of their wholeness; those who lose much of the real lose much of their wholeness. The recompense for loss and gain has never failed to match its measure. To attempt to defy Heaven and act falsely—is this not delusion?
**[Subcommentary]** Human emotions and employments are shallow and superficial, so they are easy to deceive. The natural order’s governance is profound and subtle, so it is difficult to falsify. Thus, in human affairs, one must follow one’s nature and act with sincerity.

I have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings. I have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge.
**[Annotation]** Every undertaking requires its proper tools. Without the dwelling of utmost emptiness, there is no way to achieve the reality of transforming things."

**[Subcommentary]** Just as a bird without six feathers cannot soar through the void, so too can one without dual wisdom not engage with the world. Behold that emptiness: in a vacant chamber, whiteness arises.
**[Annotation]** To regard being as non-being—this is the vacant chamber. When the chamber is empty, pure whiteness alone emerges.

**[Subcommentary]** *Pān* means observation. *Bǐ* refers to the preceding realm. *Quē* means emptiness. Observing the ten thousand existences, all are empty and quiescent; thus one can exhaust the chamber of the heart, return the illumination to the true source, and wisdom and clarity arise in accordance with use. *White* is the Dao.

"Auspiciousness rests, rests."
**[Annotation]** That which auspiciousness gathers is utmost emptiness and utmost stillness.
**[Subcommentary]** *Jí* refers to felicitous and virtuous affairs. *Xiáng* refers to propitious omens. *Zhǐ* refers to the wisdom of concentration and stillness. Auspicious and virtuous fortune rests in the concentrated and still heart; the concentrated and still heart can likewise bring forth auspicious and virtuous responses.

"If one does not rest where one ought, this is called sitting in motion."
**[Annotation]** If one does not rest where one should, nor meet the ultimate, this is to respond as if seated while galloping without cease. Thus, before external enemies arrive, one is already exhausted within—how then can one transform things?
**[Subcommentary]** If one cannot make one’s form like withered wood and one’s heart like dead ashes, then though one’s demeanor may be upright and composed, the spirit gallops—this is called sitting in form while the heart races.

"When one follows the ears and eyes to communicate inwardly yet remains external to the heart’s knowing, spirits will come to dwell—how much more so humans?"
**[Annotation]** If one closes the ears and eyes to attain what comes naturally, the function of the heart’s knowing is externalized. Thus, if one fully entrusts to nature and communicates directly, there is nowhere one does not merge with the obscure. Even the reproach of ghosts and spirits is absent—how much more the burdens of the human realm?
**[Subcommentary]** *Xùn* means to cause. If one can make the senses communicate inwardly without being ensnared by external objects, and the spirit is tranquil while the will remains external to the heart’s knowing, then one externally abandons form and internally forgets wisdom. With the body collected and the senses subdued, the mind emptied to receive things, spirits obscurely attach and dwell—is this not fitting? Human relationships turn and look up in reverence, naturally submitting—this is as it should be.

Thus, the *Outer Chapters* say: "Without ghosts to reproach, there are no humans to criticize." This is the transformation of the ten thousand things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the lifelong practice of Fuxi and Jihuang—how much more those who are scattered and ordinary?
**[Annotation]** There is no thing, noble or base, that does not rely on the heart’s knowing and the ears and eyes to communicate. Thus, what the world calls knowing—does one know in order to know? What it calls seeing—does one see in order to see? If knowing and seeing could be obtained by desire, then could one desire worthiness to become worthy, or act as a sage to become a sage? Certainly not. Yet the world does not know that knowing knows itself, and so desires to act as knowing to know; it does not see that seeing sees itself, and so desires to act as seeing to see. Not knowing that life lives itself, it would act to live. Thus, seeing the eyes, one seeks the brightness of Li Zhu; hearing the ears, one demands the acuity of Shi Kuang. The heart and spirit gallop within, the ears and eyes are exhausted without. The body is not at ease, and one does not merge with things. Not merging, how can one harmonize with the changes of the human realm or respond to the rhythms of the ages? There has never been such a case.

**[Subcommentary]** *Shì* is a demonstrative, a term of reference, pointing to the previous methods of fasting the heart. These can transform the ten thousand things and nurture all living beings. Fuxi, who tamed oxen and rode horses, was called Fuxi, surnamed Feng, and titled Tai Hao. *Jǐhuáng* refers to the sovereigns before the Three August Ones, who ruled without writing. This Way of fasting the heart was the guiding principle by which Yu and Shun responded to things, and Fuxi and Jihuang practiced it throughout their lives. How much more should the common and scattered people of the world follow this path if they wish to transform things?

When Ye Gong Zi Gao was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi, he asked Confucius: "The king’s charge to me is most weighty."
**[Annotation]** He considers the mission weighty, for he desires something.
**[Subcommentary]** The great-grandson of King Zhuang of Chu, Yin Chengzi, was named Zhu Liang, styled Zi Gao, and enfeoffed at Ye, where he usurped the title of Duke. The king—though in reality a viscount during the Spring and Autumn period—usurped the title of king. Qi was the descendant of the Grand Duke of the Jiang clan, whose ancestor was one of the Four Mountains of Yu. Some were enfeoffed at Lü, hence the Grand Duke was called Lü Wang. King Wu of Zhou enfeoffed the Grand Duke at Yingqiu, establishing the state of Qi. The two states of Qi and Chu maintained friendly relations, with envoys bearing gifts coming and going without cease. Sometimes they sought aid in emergencies, or requested troops to punish offenses. The matters were not trivial, and the trust placed in them was great. Thus, Zhu Liang was anxious and sought counsel from Confucius.

"The Qi envoys awaiting an audience are treated with great reverence but not urgency."
**[Annotation]** He fears that one may merely display reverence outwardly without promptly responding to their requests.
**[Subcommentary]** The Qi envoys came and went abruptly, without sincerity. When it came to receiving the Chu envoys, they were treated with great ceremony, but the matters they requested were not promptly granted. Given the weight of the mission, Zhu Liang harbored this concern.

"The charge is so weighty that I tremble."
**[Subcommentary]** Even a commoner’s resolve cannot be shaken—how much less a feudal lord? Considering this, he was greatly fearful and trembling.

"You once told me: 'In all affairs, whether great or small, few do not become fearful if not guided by the Dao.'"
**[Annotation]** In affairs, whether great or small, few do not become fearful if not guided by the Dao. This is what Confucius once told Zhu Liang.
**[Subcommentary]** *Zǐ* refers to Confucius.

The term *guǎ* ("few") signifies scarcity. Now, in managing the threads of affairs, the complexities are indeed manifold. Though matters may differ in scale, none do not find their fear and comfort in success. Thus, Zhu Liang invoked what he had once received to awaken later insight. If affairs do not succeed, there will surely be the peril of human norms.
**[Annotation]** Those who fear failure do so because failure invites wrath. This is something even the King of Chu cannot escape.
**[Subcommentary]** If emotions clash and affairs do not come to fruition, there will be the moral order of human relations and the anxiety of punishment.

If affairs succeed, there will surely be the peril of yin and yang.
**[Annotation]** Though the external vexation may depart, joy and fear still wage war in the breast, having already congealed ice and embers within the five viscera.
**[Subcommentary]** Joy expands the yang; sorrow contracts the yin. Once affairs succeed, the heart’s true feelings are satisfied, transforming past sorrow into present joy. Joy and fear intermingle in one heart, yin and yang clash fiercely in the five viscera—ice and embers gather, how can there be rest?

Only those with virtue can remain free from peril, whether affairs succeed or fail.
**[Annotation]** Only those with virtue can entrust success or failure to others without disturbance to the heart.
**[Subcommentary]** To remain unmoved in the spirit by gain or loss, to leave success or failure to the path ahead, and not to be burdened by sorrow or joy—this belongs only to those of great virtue.

"My meals consist of coarse fare, not refined; my kitchen has no one seeking coolness."
**[Annotation]** Facing the fire without thought of cold illustrates the frugality of his provisions.
**[Subcommentary]** *Zāng* means "refined"; *qīng* means "cool." Bearing a grave charge, his heart filled with dread, he partook of coarse sustenance, having no leisure for fine delicacies. His provisions were meager, and his kitchen staff did not wish to think of cold—yet the fire was not large, and there was no heat to avoid.

"Now, I receive my charge at court in the morning and drink ice by evening—is it inner heat that afflicts me?"
**[Annotation]** Though his provisions were meager, his inner heat drove him to drink ice, for he truly feared the difficulty of the task, not the allure of fine food.
**[Subcommentary]** Zhu Liang received his commission at dawn and drank ice by dusk, clearly showing his dread and sorrow, his inner heart scorched with anxiety. His earnest inquiry into the Dao illuminated this state of mind.

"I have not yet reached the truth of the matter, yet I already suffer the peril of yin and yang. If the affair does not succeed, there will surely be the peril of human norms. These are the two anxieties."
**[Annotation]** Before the affair is settled, one only fears it will not succeed. If it truly fails, fear will lodge within while the net of punishment ensnares without.
**[Subcommentary]** When the outcome of a matter is undecided and success or failure unknown, yet sorrow and joy already reside in the heart—this is the peril of yin and yang. If affairs go awry and do not come to fruition, there will be the Way of the minister and the reach of the penal net. With these two anxieties, where can one escape fault?

"As a minister, I am unworthy of this task. You must have something to tell me."
**[Subcommentary]** Unworthy as a minister, overstepping my station, my position is high but my virtue shallow—I am unfit for this task. Since you are a sage, your nature encompasses all things, and you have the means—pray, enlighten me."

Confucius said: "Under heaven, there are two great precepts: the first is fate; the second is righteousness."
**[Subcommentary]** *Jiè* means "precept." Within the realm, teachings and laws are myriad, but none are more essential than these two. Their meanings are elaborated below.

"Your love for your parents is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart."
**[Annotation]** Naturally bound and fixed, it cannot be untied.
**[Subcommentary]** The filial son serves his parents with utmost love and respect. This nature and fate arise from heaven, following the heart’s true course—thus it cannot be untied.

"A minister’s service to his lord is righteousness—there is no place under heaven where one is not the lord’s subject, nowhere to escape within the bounds of heaven and earth."
**[Annotation]** When a thousand gather, if not one is master, disorder leads to dissolution. Thus, many worthy men cannot mean many lords, and no worthy men cannot mean no lord—this is the Way of heaven and man, the utmost propriety.
**[Subcommentary]** The principle of lord and minister is inherently so. Thus, the loyal minister serves his lord, dying to fulfill his duty—this is the convergence of duty, not a matter of heavenly nature. Yet though the six directions are vast, there is no lordless state. If one bears guilt, where can one escape fault? Thus, one accepts the charge and departs, without hesitation in advance or retreat.

These are called the great precepts.
**[Annotation]** If the lord could be escaped and parents untied, they would not be precepts.
**[Subcommentary]** This concludes the meaning of the great precepts regarding lord and parent.

"Thus, one who serves his parents does not choose a place to settle them—this is the utmost filial piety."
**[Subcommentary]** The filial son, in serving his parents, seeks only their comfort. Whether seeking office or emolument, he does not choose high or low, finding contentment wherever he is—this is true utmost filial piety.

"One who serves his lord does not choose his tasks to settle in them—this is the height of loyalty."
**[Subcommentary]** The loyal minister serves his lord with unwavering devotion, undeterred by peril or ease, accepting his lot as fate. How can he pick and choose between advantage and harm before acting? One who can do so is the paragon of loyal ministers.

"One who serves his own heart does not alter joy or sorrow before events—knowing the inevitable and accepting it as fate, this is the utmost virtue."
**[Annotation]** Knowing the inevitable is fate and accepting it, there is neither sorrow nor joy—how can one alter or impose them? Thus, obscurely taking what one encounters as fate and not engaging the heart in its midst, merging indistinguishably with what is most fitting and having no joy or sorrow within—though serving others, one is ever at ease, let alone with lord or parent.
**[Subcommentary]** The man of the Dao who settles his own heart and mind perceives no difference between adversity and prosperity, understanding that gain and loss are one. Thus, he traverses the realms of sorrow and joy without altering his course, knowing that success and failure are inevitable—how can human sentiment control them?

Thus, to settle the heart and follow fate without contravening the principles of Heaven—unless one is a perfected person of profound virtue, who could equal this? For those who serve as ministers or children, there are inevitably circumstances beyond their control. In acting according to the circumstances while forgetting the self,

**[Annotation]** Affairs have their inevitable course, and principle is inherently constant. Thus, yielding to them brings order to affairs, and when affairs are ordered, the self is never lost—why then trouble the heart over the existence of the self?

**[Subcommentary]** When ministers and children serve their lords and parents, they must inevitably give their lives and exhaust their sincerity. When affairs arise, they act without hesitation or choice, forgetting the self to attend to duty—this is only fitting. If it cannot be avoided, one must submit to fate. How could there be leisure to delight in life and shrink from death? In this, the Master’s conduct is exemplary.

**[Annotation]** Principle admits of no obstruction, so one should simply proceed directly with what one encounters. If one’s commitment to the Dao is not steadfast and delight or aversion remain in the heart, if one cannot advance together with what is most fitting while scheming for life and fearing death, one will never see one’s affairs brought to completion.

**[Subcommentary]** Since one is acting on behalf of others, there is no room for delight or aversion. Receiving the lord’s command, one must only act with equanimity—how could there be time to scheme for life and fear death?

Confucius then requested to add what he had heard: In all dealings, when close, one must yield to one another in good faith,

**[Annotation]** Those who are near can interact directly, so their trust is verified by mutual yielding and submission.

when distant, one must be loyal in speech,

**[Annotation]** From afar, intentions are conveyed through words.

**[Subcommentary]** In interactions with those nearby, one yields in accordance with natural feeling; with those far away, one relies on words to express loyalty. This is Confucius citing what he has heard to admonish Zilu. Words must sometimes be transmitted.

Now, transmitting words of mutual delight or mutual anger is the most difficult task under Heaven.

**[Annotation]** When words express delight or anger, if they exceed what is fitting, the transmitter must ensure neither side loses the mean—thus it is not easy.

**[Subcommentary]** Conveying intentions through messengers, sending someone to transmit them, with both sides sometimes pleased, sometimes angry—this is no easy task for the intermediary. For when both are pleased, there will surely be excessive praise; when both are angry, there will surely be excessive slander.

**[Annotation]** *Yi* (溢) means "to exceed." Words of delight or anger often exceed what is appropriate.

**[Subcommentary]** *Yi* means "to exceed." When two people mutually praise or revile, if they follow their emotions, their words of praise or blame will necessarily go too far.

All such excesses are false,

**[Annotation]** Suspecting the words are not truly theirs, it seems the transmitter has fabricated them.

**[Subcommentary]** *Lei* means "to resemble." Words that exceed what is fitting are not truly real; when the listener doubts them, it seems the messenger has falsely constructed them.

and when false, they are not trusted,

**[Annotation]** *Mo* means to be filled with doubt.

**[Subcommentary]** *Mo* describes a state of doubt. Since it seems the transmitter has fabricated them, distrust arises, and the listener is filled with doubt.

and when not trusted, the transmitter incurs misfortune.

**[Annotation]** Transmitting excessive words seems like fabrication. When the recipient doubts them, the transmitter is arbitrarily blamed for exaggerating or diminishing.

**[Subcommentary]** When the recipient grows doubtful and distrustful, misfortune befalls the messenger.

Thus, the *Fayan* says: Transmit the constant feelings, do not transmit excessive words, and you will be close to preservation.

**[Annotation]** Though you hear momentary excessive words, do not transmit them. You must convey the constant feelings and ensure their sincerity—then you will be close to preservation.

**[Subcommentary]** In dealing with others as an intermediary, the task is truly difficult. One must first examine the constant feelings and ensure the host and guest meet at the mean, not transmitting momentary delight or anger to cause discord in their words. One who can do this will be close to preserving themselves. The Master cites the model words of the former sages as a guide for future conduct.

Moreover, those who compete in skill and strength begin with yang—

**[Annotation]** Originally sharing playful delight.

—yet invariably end in yin—

**[Annotation]** As the desire to prevail intensifies, harm toward the other arises in secret.

**[Subcommentary]** Yang is joy; yin is anger. When testing strength in play, there is no lack of cunning. At first, the mood is one of lighthearted caution; but by the end, the heart breeds resentment and wrath, and the urge to dominate covertly gives rise to harm. Such is the way of joy and anger in the world—this example of competing in strength serves as an analogy.

When excess reaches its height, strange craft abounds—

**[Annotation]** No longer following reason.

**[Subcommentary]** When anger and the thirst for victory grow extreme, the mind overflows with cunning and deceit, a hundred stratagems unfolding.

Those who drink wine according to ritual begin with order—

**[Annotation]** Distinctions of honor and humility are observed, and toasts proceed in proper sequence.

—yet invariably end in chaos—

**[Annotation]** Drunkenness and indulgence run rampant.

**[Subcommentary]** Order is principle. When host and guest exchange cups, there is an inherent pattern; yet once caps are askew, hierarchy dissolves. All things begin in correctness and end in disorder—this example of drinking wine serves as an analogy.

When excess reaches its height, strange pleasures abound—

**[Annotation]** Dissipation and abandon know no bounds.

**[Subcommentary]** Once the feast grows wild, indulgence knows no limit: songs are sung again and again, dances spun without end, all restraint cast aside. In every way, the strange and extraordinary abound—how boundless the revelry!

In all matters, it is ever thus: they begin in sincerity and invariably end in baseness.

Its beginning is ever simple; its end must be vast.

**[Annotation]** For complexity arises from simplicity, and affairs begin in subtlety—this is the inevitable course of things.

**[Subcommentary]** Even in trifling matters and common affairs, it is ever thus: all things begin in sincerity and end in baseness; they start with small steps and conclude in great magnitude. Thus complexity arises from simplicity, and affairs begin in subtlety. This serves as a combined analogy.

Words are like wind and waves; actions bring true loss or gain.

**[Annotation]** Words are like wind and waves, and thus acting upon them leads to the loss of truth.

**[Subcommentary]** Just as water stirs into waves at the touch of wind, so too does the heart stir with joy or anger at the touch of words. Therefore, to act upon such wind-and-wave words is to lose hold of true principle. For wind and waves are easily stirred, and the loss of truth easily brings peril.

**[Annotation]** Thus, if one leaves wind and waves unacted upon, truth remains unlost. When affairs rest upon their true nature, peril may be stilled and turmoil settled.

**[Subcommentary]** Wind churns water into waves, making them easily agitated—just as words that stray from truth readily bring danger. Thus, anger arises without cause, through artful speech and biased words.

**[Annotation]** Anger arises from no other source; it is always born of artful words that exceed truth and biased speech that misses the mark.

**[Subcommentary]** The stirring of anger has no other cause—it is ever the result of false, artful words, biased speech, and flattering deceit.

When a beast is cornered, it does not choose its cries; its breath grows stifled, and from this, a fierce heart arises.

**[Annotation]** Like a wild beast driven into a corner, when its will is desperate and its strength spent, it does not utter harmonious sounds, nor does its breath flow smoothly. Instead, it bristles with sudden fury, and both beast and pursuer grow vicious in their confrontation.

**[Subcommentary]** When a wild beast is pressed into a desperate corner, its life hanging by a thread, it howls without regard for sound; its breath becomes stifled, its heart grows diseased, and in a sudden burst of rage, it lunges to bite its pursuer. This serves as another analogy.

When scrutiny becomes too exacting, unworthy thoughts inevitably arise in response—yet one remains unaware of it.

**[Annotation]** When one is broad and accommodating, others naturally gather. But when scrutiny becomes too precise, a stingy and petty heart arises without one’s awareness.

The great person lets things unfold freely in the realm of self-attainment, neither begrudging another’s ability nor exhausting another’s joy. Thus, the bonds of the four seas may be preserved whole.

**[Subcommentary]** When one presses too closely and exacts too much, unworthy thoughts naturally arise in response, for things follow their own principles. Thus, haste loses one’s lordly bearing, while generosity wins the multitude.

If one remains unaware of this, who can foresee where it will end?

**[Annotation]** If one does not perceive this, how can one know where fortune or misfortune will lead?

**[Subcommentary]** Impatience repels others, and such actions summon their own consequences—yet one remains unaware. If unworthy thoughts arise in response, who can foresee the calamity that may follow?

Thus, the *Fa Yan* says: Do not alter commands.

**[Annotation]** Transmit their true substance.

**[Subcommentary]** When carrying out a ruler’s command, convey its true meaning; do not alter it on a whim according to one’s own joy or anger.

Do not urge completion.

**[Annotation]** Let it come to fruition on its own.

**[Subcommentary]** State the ruler’s command plainly and let matters take their course; do not press or cajole to force its completion.

To exceed the proper measure is to add needlessly.

**[Annotation]** Adding is not to let things be as they are.

**[Subcommentary]** Abide by Heaven’s mandate, follow one’s nature, and act in accord with feeling—do not embellish with words beyond the original measure.

Altering commands and urging completion endanger affairs.

**[Annotation]** This brings affairs to peril.

**[Subcommentary]** To change a ruler’s command or force its completion is to place the matter in grave danger.

What is beautifully accomplished endures; what is badly accomplished cannot be undone.

**[Annotation]** Beautiful accomplishment comes from allowing things to transform in their own time—like planting, which cannot be rushed to fruition in a single morning.

**[Subcommentary]** What the heart deems beautiful comes to fulfillment naturally, without urging—thus it endures.

**[Annotation]** What one finds repugnant yet forces to completion will soon bring regret.

**[Subcommentary]** What the heart finds repugnant, if forced to completion, will not last long before remorse follows.

Can one not be cautious?

**[Subcommentary]** In navigating the world and carrying out commands, one should heed the cautionary words of the sages.

Moreover, to ride things with a wandering heart,

**[Annotation]** To entrust one’s intent to things.

**[Subcommentary]** The one who embodies solitary transformation moves freely among people, riding things with a wandering heart and following the world with an empty mind—what peril could there be?

To entrust oneself to what cannot be otherwise in nurturing the center—this is perfection.

**[Annotation]** To follow what is inevitably so is to fully embody the mark of the mean; this is the highest way of engaging with things.

**[Subcommentary]** What cannot be otherwise is the inevitable course of principle. To entrust oneself to such inevitability in nurturing the center is to reach the ultimate truth and the most wondrous way of responding to things.

What need is there to contrive a response?

**[Annotation]** One should simply follow the true nature of what is to be repaid—why contrive intentions in the matter?

**[Subcommentary]** Follow one’s own nature, act in accord with principle—why preemptively devise calculations to contrive a response?

It is better to deliver the command faithfully. This is the difficult part.

**[Annotation]** To deliver the command directly is easiest, yet one’s own joy and anger intervene in the heart—this is why it is difficult.

**[Subcommentary]** To deliver directly, following one’s nature and entrusting to Heaven’s command, is simplicity itself—how could it be difficult? Yet when it speaks of "this being the difficult part," it means that it is not truly difficult.

When Yan He was about to become tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei,
**[Subcommentary]** His surname was Yan, given name He, a worthy man of Lu. The crown prince was cruel and harsh. Yan He traveled from Lu to Wei, intending to serve as the prince’s tutor.

he asked Lian Boyu:
**[Subcommentary]** His surname was Lian, given name Huan, courtesy name Boyu, a worthy minister of Wei. The prince’s virtue was as harsh as Heaven’s wrath, delighting in slaughter. Since he was a man of Wei, the text says, "There is a man here." As he was to become tutor to the heir apparent, he sought counsel from this wise man.

"If I deal with him without method, I endanger the state; if I deal with him by method, I endanger myself."
**[Annotation]** The nature of petty men is such that if you guide them by rules, they resent you; if you indulge them without restraint, they throw the state into chaos.
**[Subcommentary]** *Fang* means "method." His nature was fierce and stubborn, devoid of benevolence and righteousness. If you imposed methods upon him, his resentment would endanger you; if you indulged him without restraint, his excesses would ruin the state.

"His knowledge suffices only to perceive others’ faults, not the cause of those faults."
**[Annotation]** He does not recognize that the people’s faults arise from himself, so he blames the people and does not reform.
**[Subcommentary]** With no virtue of his own to reform, he metes out extreme punishments for the people’s crimes. He sees only the commoners’ transgressions, not that the faults originate in himself. Since he knows that, like wind bending grass, blame lies with the ruler, what then is to be done?

Lian Boyu said: "Excellent question! Be on guard, be cautious, and rectify yourself first.
**[Annotation]** To repeatedly reflect and adjust is how one rectifies the self.
**[Subcommentary]** *Jie* means "to warn." One must not act carelessly. Be vigilant in guiding the crown prince, avoid provoking him, walk the upright path, and adapt to circumstances. First, praise his ability to ask; later, show him the method.

In form, do not oppose; in heart, do not resist.
**[Annotation]** In form, do not act contrary; in heart, harmonize without conformity.
**[Subcommentary]** In conduct, follow and do not violate the rites of ruler and minister. In wisdom, harmonize and blend, adapting to all matters.

Yet these two have their limits.
**[Subcommentary]** The two methods above are but rough outlines. They are not yet perfect, for they still entail encumbrances.

Do not let form lead to compliance,
**[Annotation]** *Jiu* means "to follow in form"; *ru* means "to fully conform."
**[Subcommentary]** As Guo’s commentary says: *Jiu* means "to follow in form"; *ru* means "to fully conform."

nor let harmony lead to display.
**[Annotation]** *He* means "to aid with righteousness"; *chu* means "to show off one’s merits."
**[Subcommentary]** In heart, harmonize and guide with skillful means, attributing success to the crown prince without displaying one’s own ability—this is not "display."

If form follows and fully complies, you will fall, perish, collapse, or stumble.
**[Annotation]** If you fully conform, you fail to support what is endangered, perishing with him. Thus, one should model oneself on Heaven and Earth, differing only in minor ways.
**[Subcommentary]** *Dian* means "to overturn"; *mie*, "to extinguish"; *beng*, "to crumble"; *jue*, "to fail." If in form you follow and fully conform to his evil, you fail to support what is endangered, so that the state will be overthrown, extinguished, crumbled to dust, and ruined along with him.

If the heart harmonizes and displays itself, you will become a reputation, a name, an omen, a calamity.
**[Annotation]** If you display yourself, you will incur the reputation of bearing shame. If you aid his wrongdoing, he will resent your superiority and falsely accuse you of harboring evil.
**[Subcommentary]** To turn against things is to become an omen. *Nie* means "disaster." Though you harmonize and blend like dust, if you display your wisdom and fail to conceal your brilliance, you will gain a reputation for equaling him. He will resent your superiority and falsely accuse you of harboring evil, seeking to harm you through schemes.

If he acts like an infant, act like an infant with him; if he acts without boundaries, act without boundaries with him; if he acts without limits, act without limits with him. Guide him thus, and you will enter without flaw.
**[Annotation]** Do not set up minor distinctions to provoke his scales.
**[Subcommentary]** *Ding* means "to evaluate"; *qi*, "to divide"; *yu*, "to share." To engage with the world is inherently difficult. One cannot fully conform nor entirely oppose. Whether he acts like a foolish infant, or like a wild field without boundaries, or indulges in excessive demands and violent slaughter, guide him with virtue and align him with ritual. One who grasps this path enters the way without encumbrance.

Do you not know the mantis? It brandished its arms to block the chariot’s wheels, unaware that it was unequal to the task—yet this was the beauty of its ability.
**[Annotation]** The mantis’s brandishing of its arms is not without beauty; it is simply no match for the chariot’s wheels. Now, to know there is no alternative and still forcibly take on the task is like the mantis brandishing its arms.

**[Subcommentary]** The *tangluo* is an insect bearing axe-like forelegs. When the mantis raises its arms in fury to block the wheel-tracks of a grand chariot, though it relies on the beauty and excellence of its own ability, it still cannot fulfill its intended task. This is like Yan He, who sought to match his own talents against the power of the heir apparent—how is this different from the mantis raising its arms to block the chariot’s wheels? Be warned, be cautious. To accumulate and boast of your own abilities in order to challenge such a one is perilous indeed.

**[Annotation]** To amass your talents and vaunt your own excellence in order to provoke this man is a path to danger.

**[Subcommentary]** *Ji* means "to store up"; *er* means "you"; *ji* means "danger." Having become tutor to the heir apparent, you ought to be vigilant. Yet now you hoard your talents, pride yourself on your own excellence, and provoke his authority—this will surely lead to your ruin.

Do you not know the man who rears tigers? He dares not feed it living creatures, for fear of its killing rage.

**[Annotation]** He fears that the act of killing will provoke its fury.

**[Subcommentary]** Do you understand the method of raising tigers? One must not offer living swine or sheep to a fierce beast, lest the act of killing stir its wrath. Nor does one dare give it whole carcasses, for fear of its tearing rage.

**[Annotation]** If the tiger must gnaw and divide the meat itself, the effort will incite its fury.

**[Subcommentary]** Even when offering dead prey, one must first portion it out. If the tiger must tear it apart itself, the exertion may provoke its anger. One must time its hunger and satiety, and understand the causes of its rage.

**[Annotation]** To know what provokes its anger and act accordingly.

**[Subcommentary]** By knowing the rhythms of its hunger and fullness, and grasping the patterns of its joy and fury, one aligns with the principles of things—how could danger then arise? Though tigers and humans are of different kinds, the tiger fawns upon its keeper when treated with compliance. Thus, those it kills are those who act in opposition.

**[Annotation]** When one follows the natural order, even creatures of different kinds grow affectionate; when one violates it, even the closest kin turn to violence.

**[Subcommentary]** Compliance brings delight and tameness, so that even tigers and wolves may be domesticated. Opposition brings slaughter, so that even the closest kin take up arms against one another. The way of nurturing oneself is the same; the method of engaging with things is no different.

Now, the lover of horses uses a basket to collect its dung and a conch shell to gather its urine.

**[Annotation]** Dung and urine are the basest of things, yet he stores them in precious vessels—this is the height of love for his horse.

**[Subcommentary]** *Shen* refers to a large clam. The man who cherishes his horse’s dung does so out of a desire to honor it. Though excrement and urine are the basest of things, he uses a great clam to contain them, so bound is he by his attachment.

Then, when a swarm of mosquitoes or horseflies alight upon the horse,

**[Annotation]** They cluster upon the horse in great numbers.

and he strikes them at the wrong moment,

**[Annotation]** Though he means to relieve the horse’s distress, he startles it by acting unexpectedly.

the horse breaks its bit, shatters its bridle, and smashes its chest.

**[Annotation]** Caught off guard, the horse is so startled that it comes to this.

**[Subcommentary]** *Pu* means "to gather"; *pi* means "to strike"; *xian* means "the bit."

When mosquitoes and insects gather upon the horse, the master, cherishing it so deeply, impulsively strikes at them, intending to remove the harm. Yet lacking proper timing, he startles the horse unawares, causing it to bolt in sudden terror. Thus the horse snaps its bit, shatters its bridle, and tramples its master, crushing his chest and smashing his skull. Where attachment runs deepest, loss follows—can one not be cautious?

**[Annotation]** His intent was to relieve the horse’s distress, but acting rashly, he brought about destruction, losing the very object of his care. Thus in all worldly dealings, one must be mindful of the interplay between resistance and compliance.

**[Subcommentary]** *Loss* here means *forfeiture*. His attachment was fixed upon the horse, yet in destroying it, he lost what he loved. In human affairs, the same principle applies: when responses to circumstances are misaligned, disaster strikes. The lesson of the horse and its master demands the utmost care.

Carpenter Shi traveled to Qi and came to Qu Yuan, where he saw a *li* tree standing by the earth-altar.

**[Subcommentary]** *Zhi* means "to go." *Qu Yuan* is the name of a mountain, its paths winding like those west of Mount Song, where the road is called *Bao Yuan*—this is of the same kind. *Li* is the name of a tree; *she* is the earth deity. The altar is a mound of earth for sacrifices, called *she* because it "spews forth" (*tu*) all things, hence the name. *Jiang* is a general term for craftsmen, while *Shi* is the given name of this particular master. Traveling from Lu to Qi, he passed through the winding roads and saw this extraordinary tree, gnarled and useless. This illustrates that in navigating human affairs, one must recognize the use in what seems useless. Its girth could shade an ox, its circumference bound by a hundred spans.

**[Subcommentary]** *Xu* means "to bind." This *li* tree by the earth-altar was exceptionally tall, its branches and leaves casting shade enough to cover a thousand oxen. When measured with a rope, its girth spanned a hundred feet. The *Zhuangzi* text from the Jiangnan region often speaks of it shading an ox, omitting the "thousand" character—this version appears to be in error. For the tree at Shangqiu could shelter a thousand chariots, so how could the one at Qu Yuan shade only a single ox? By this comparison, the version with "thousands" is correct.

Its height towered a thousand *ren* before branches appeared, while along its sides grew a dozen or so trunks large enough to make boats.

**[Subcommentary]** A *ren* is seven feet. This tree rose straight and towering over seventy feet before sprouting branches, blocking the sun and brushing the clouds. The trunks suitable for boats numbered in the dozens. Such was its form.

Spectators thronged like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter paid it no heed, continuing on his way without pause.

**[Subcommentary]** *Chuo* means "to stop." The tree was extraordinarily large, drawing crowds of onlookers. Only Carpenter Shi, recognizing its worthlessness, passed by without a glance.

The disciple, weary of gazing, ran to catch up with Carpenter Shi and said: "Since I took up the axe and followed you, Master, I have never seen timber so magnificent. Yet you refuse to look, walking on without pause—why?"

**[Subcommentary]** The disciple marveled at the tree’s extraordinary grandeur and stood transfixed in admiration. Proud of his long apprenticeship, he had never seen wood so wondrously vast—yet the master carpenter paid it no heed. Catching up, he could not help but ask.

"Enough," said Carpenter Shi. "Say no more."

**[Subcommentary]** *Yi* means "to stop." Carpenter Shi knew the great tree was useless, unfit for worldly purposes. Fearing his disciple’s words would be wasteful, he rebuked him and commanded silence.

"It is a *scattered tree*—if made into a boat, it would sink; if made into a coffin or outer casket, it would rot swiftly.

**[Subcommentary]** The tree’s wood is heavy: as a boat, it would sink; near earth, it decays quickly. A loose-grained tree, it lives out its natural years—useless timber, left to idleness.

If made into vessels, it would break easily.

**[Subcommentary]** Among human artifacts, durability is prized. This wood, brittle and porous, would surely shatter early.

If made into doors, it would ooze sap; if made into beams, it would be worm-eaten.

**[Subcommentary]** *Ye* means the exudation of resin. *Du* refers to internal rot. As doors, it would seep sap; as beams, it would be infested and unstable.

It is a *useless tree*, good for nothing—yet this is why it has attained such longevity."

**[Commentary]** Not counted among the useful, it is called a *scattered tree*.

**[Subcommentary]** Loose-grained and brittle, it is indeed useless timber, unfit for any purpose—thus spared an early demise.

That night, Carpenter Shi dreamed the tree appeared to him, saying: "To what would you compare me? Would you liken me to the *patterned trees*?"

**[Commentary]** All useful timber is called *patterned trees*.

**[Subcommentary]** *Wu hu* means "to what." *Ruo* means "you." *Yu* means "me."

The useful trees are called *patterned trees*. Carpenter Shi returned and retired to sleep, whereupon the *li* tree appeared to him in a dream and asked: "With what would you compare me? Would you liken me to a *scattered tree* of no use, or to a *patterned tree* of fine grain and utility? Consider the wild pear, the chestnut, the orange, the pomelo, and the melon gourds—*[Subcommentary]* Those that grow on trees are called *fruits*, such as the wild pear and its kind; those that grow on the ground are called *vegetables*, such as melons and gourds. Would you compare me to these? In truth, once they ripen, they are stripped and humiliated; their great branches break, their small branches are torn. This is because their very usefulness brings suffering to their lives, so they do not fulfill their natural span but perish midway, struck down by the common world. All things are thus. *[Commentary]* All things harm themselves through their own usefulness. *[Subcommentary]* Such fruits and gourds, though their flavors are sweet, once their seeds and flesh ripen, are stripped and cast down—whereupon their great branches snap and their small branches are torn. Is this not because their delicious flavors bring suffering to their lives? The words of ruin and disgrace refer precisely to this. Though they sprout in spring and fall in autumn, fulfilling their natural span, they are battered midway and called *prematurely cut down*. Yet they, lacking awareness, and all worldly things besides, harm and cut short their lives through their usefulness. Thus this concludes: none are not so. *Shi* means "to strike."

As for me, I have long sought to be of no use—nearly dying in the process—until now, when I have attained it. *[Commentary]* Many have looked askance at me, but only now has Carpenter Shi understood. This is my great usefulness. *[Commentary]* To accumulate uselessness is to achieve the great usefulness of sustaining life. *[Subcommentary]* Being of no use, I have thus preserved my life. The *li* tree has sought this for a long time. Yet clumsy craftsmen, mistaking me for a *patterned tree*, have repeatedly come to inspect me, intending to fell me, fearing only the axe that would cut short my life. Now, meeting a master craftsman who recognizes my uselessness, I have at last preserved my life—this is my great usefulness. *Ji* means "nearly." Had I been useful, could I have grown so great? *[Commentary]* If useful, I would have long since been felled. *[Subcommentary]* Had I been a *patterned tree* of some use, I would long since have been hacked down, cut short by axes—how could I have grown so large and lived so long?

Moreover, you and I are both things—how could we truly know one another? *[Subcommentary]* You and I are both creatures of the same creation—how could things ever truly know one another? *Nai he zai* is an interrogative phrase. And you, a *scattered man* nearly dead, what could you know of a *scattered tree*? *[Commentary]* This is said in jest to Carpenter Shi. *[Subcommentary]* Carpenter Shi calls me a *scattered tree* for my uselessness, while the *li* tree calls him a *scattered man* for his misplaced skill. You flaunt your talents in the common world, and so verge on premature ruin; I, through my scattered uselessness, have preserved my life. You are a *scattered man* on the brink of death—how could you know I am a *scattered tree*? This is spoken in a dream to tease Carpenter Shi.

Carpenter Shi awoke and interpreted his dream. *[Subcommentary]* *Zhen* means "to divine." Awakening, Carpenter Shi pondered the dream and divined its meaning, then told his disciples. His disciples asked: "If its purpose is to be of no use, why then does it serve as a shrine tree?" *[Commentary]* They still suspect it takes pride in being a shrine tree rather than simply seeking to be of no use. *[Subcommentary]* The *li* tree’s intent is to be of no use, thereby preserving its life—so why does it serve as a shrine tree to glorify itself? The disciples did not understand, hence this question. He replied: "Hush."

"If you remain silent—it merely lodges there by chance.
*[Commentary]* The shrine spirit comes to lodge of its own accord; this tree does not seek to become a shrine.
*[Subcommentary]* *If* means "you." *That* refers to the shrine. You must be discreet and not speak carelessly. The shrine spirit comes to lodge of its own accord—it has nothing to do with this tree’s seeking to become a shrine.

It takes this as those who do not know it reviling it.
*[Commentary]* This tree regards the shrine as failing to recognize its true nature, thus bringing disgrace and harm—how could this be an honor?
*[Subcommentary]* *Reviling* means "disgrace." The shrine spirit, not understanding that this tree values uselessness as its true use—cherishing the preservation of its life—comes to lodge here arbitrarily, deeply offending it. Far from being an honor, this is a humiliation.

If it were not a shrine tree, how much more would it be so?
*[Commentary]* Since it inherently values uselessness as its use, even if it were not a shrine tree, it would still avoid the harm of being felled.
*[Subcommentary]* This tree, being scattered and unfit for use, thus preserves its life. Even if it were not a shrine tree, would it ever come close to the harm of being felled?

Moreover, what it preserves differs from the multitude.
*[Commentary]* It preserves itself by not preserving, while the multitude preserves itself by preserving.
*[Subcommentary]* The scattered tree preserves its life through uselessness, while the so-called "useful" trees perish young due to their talents—this is how they differ.

Yet you praise it in the name of *yi*—is this not far off the mark?
*[Commentary]* Benefiting others, sustaining things, and restraining people from wrongdoing—these are the *yi* of the shrine. But the useless one, serene and inactive, allows all talents to function on their own. Each finds its proper place without interference—this is how the useless preserves itself. You praise it in the name of the shrine’s *yi*, yet you are not even close.
*[Subcommentary]* The scattered tree, endowed by nature with worthlessness, relies on its uselessness to preserve its life. Yet the shrine spirit lodges here, turning this into a disgrace, and now you further praise it in the name of *yi*—how much farther from the truth could you be?

Nanbo Ziqi was wandering in Shangqiu when he saw an extraordinary tree. A thousand four-horse chariots could shelter beneath its shade, resting in the cool of its rustling leaves.
*[Commentary]* Its branches cast shade enough to shelter a thousand chariots.
*[Subcommentary]* *Bo* means "elder." His Way was so revered that he could lead all things, hence he was called *Bo*—this was Nan Guo Zi Qin. Shangqiu was a place in the region of Liang and Song. A *si* is a team of four horses. *Su* means "shade." Zi Qin, traveling through the land of Song, passed by Shangqiu and saw a great tree unlike any other. Its trunk was tall and sturdy, its branches and leaves luxuriant, casting a vast shade where countless chariots and horses could take shelter.

Zi Qin said: "What tree is this? It must possess extraordinary qualities."
*[Subcommentary]* Zi Qin, seeing this tree, did not recognize its name but suspected it had some exceptional ability, hence his astonishment.

Looking up at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and crooked, unfit for beams or rafters. Looking down at its great roots, he saw they were split and twisted like a turning axle, unfit for coffins or outer caskets.
*[Subcommentary]* *Split like an axle* means the wood turns like a wheel’s hub, referring to its twisted grain. A coffin encloses the body entirely—*guan* means "complete." An outer casket encloses the coffin entirely."

The timber for beams and pillars must be straight—crookedness renders it useless; coffins and outer caskets require solidity—splitting and scattering undermine their strength. If one chews its leaves, the mouth festers and becomes injured; if one smells them, it induces a raving intoxication that persists for three days without cease.
*[Subcommentary]* Chewing the leaves with the tongue causes the lips and mouth to fester and injure; inhaling their scent through the nose brings unending stupor. *Xing* refers to the sickness of drunkenness.

Zi Qin said: "This tree is truly one of no use, yet it has grown to such immense size."
*[Subcommentary]* Its entire body being without utility may be called the great talent of preserving life whole; its utter uselessness to all is precisely the wondrous function of aiding others. Thus it escapes the axe’s early doom and shelters a thousand chariots in its shade.

Ah, the spirit-like person—it is by this very uselessness!
*[Annotation]* The Celestial King is "without talent" among the hundred officials, so the hundred officials manage their affairs: the clear-sighted see for him, the keen-eared hear for him, the wise plan for him, the brave contend for him. What does Heaven do? It remains darkly silent, that is all.

Yet when the multitude of useful trees do not lose their proper place, it is precisely the useless tree upon which they most depend. Thus the world delights in exalting it without weariness, riding upon the ten thousand things without harming them.

*[Subcommentary]* The perfected person is spirit-like, so profound that yin and yang cannot fathom him; he merges with the human realm, blending his light so that it does not shine. Thus his roots run deep and his stem is firm, achieving long life and enduring vision. Like a boat or a ship, he shelters the myriad things, shading the black-haired people. Compare him to the sacred mulberry: though it stands apart from common timber, it is by this very uselessness that the spirit-like person is praised. The so-called "useless" is truly the greatest of talents.

In Song there was a place called Jing-shi, where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry grew in abundance.
*[Subcommentary]* Jing-shi is a place name. In the state of Song, there was a region called Ju-shi where these three trees—catalpa, cypress, and mulberry—all grew straight and tall, fit for timber. This briefly illustrates how fine timber meets an early end by the axe, contrasting with the scattered trees of no use that preserve their lives whole.

Those with trunks the span of two hands or one were felled by those seeking switches to discipline monkeys;
*[Subcommentary]* "Two hands" refers to a double span, "one hand" to a single span. Monkeys here mean macaques. "Switches" refers to roots or branches, also meaning to break. Trees of this size, their timber not large, were cut into rods to strike mischievous monkeys.

Those three or four spans in girth were felled by those seeking beams for lofty halls or fine names;
*[Subcommentary]* "Beams" refer to roof ridges, also to small boats. "Lofty names" mean honor and renown. Trees of three or four spans in girth, their timber somewhat larger, were taken by those seeking glory, high roofs, or fine boats.

Those seven or eight spans in girth were felled by the households of nobles and wealthy merchants seeking planks for coffins.
*[Subcommentary]* "Planks" refer to coffin boards. Also, a coffin made from a single side of a tree, not joined, is called a "single-side plank." Trees of seven or eight spans in girth, their timber very large, were cut down by the wealthy and merchant families seeking large boards for coffins.

Thus they did not complete their Heaven-appointed years but met an untimely end midway by the axe—this is the calamity of being useful.
*[Annotation]* Those with utility cannot avoid being prized.
*[Subcommentary]* Because they are useful, they do not fulfill their natural lifespan but perish midway at the hands of craftsmen. All this is the harm that comes from their utility.

Therefore, for expiatory rites, oxen with white foreheads, pigs with upturned snouts, and men with hemorrhoids were not taken to the river.
*[Annotation]* Shamans and invocators, when performing expiations, would first carefully select their words and offerings before daring to proceed.
*[Subcommentary]* "Forehead" refers to the brow; "upturned" means raised. Hemorrhoids are a disease of lower leakage. Shamans and invocators, when presenting straw dogs for sacrifices or selecting cattle and pigs for expiations, must choose pure and unblemished animals, demonstrating utmost sincerity as if the spirits were present, hoping to move the ghosts and gods. Yet here were pigs with upturned snouts and broken foreheads, calves with white foreheads that could not be rejected, and men with filthy hemorrhoid diseases—these three, being unclean, could not be taken to the sacred river for offerings. In ancient times, people were sent into the river to sacrifice to the River Earl; when Ximen Bao served as magistrate of Ye, he put an end to this practice—this is an example of such rites. The shamans and invocators knew this well:
*[Annotation]* The shamans and invocators also knew that the useless remain whole.
Thus they deemed them inauspicious. Yet this is precisely how the spirit-like person achieves the greatest auspiciousness.
*[Annotation]* Preserving life whole is what the world calls auspicious. Shamans and invocators, deeming the useless inauspicious and refusing to use them, do not realize that it is by this very inauspiciousness that life is preserved whole—this is the greatest auspiciousness. The spirit-like person, without fixed intent, follows the flow of things. Thus what the world calls the greatest auspiciousness, the spirit-like person does not reject.
*[Subcommentary]* Women are called shamans, men are called invocators. Invocators are those who hold tablets and recite sacrificial texts. "Auspicious" means good. When shamans, invocators, and scribes perform expiations, they know these three—white-foreheaded oxen, upturned-snouted pigs, and men with hemorrhoids—are unfit for offerings and discard them as inauspicious. Yet the spirit-like person, attuned to the transformations of nature, knows that the useless and valueless preserve life whole. Thus the talk of white foreheads, upturned snouts, and hemorrhoids as inauspicious is merely the narrow view of lesser shamans—how could it be the comprehensive wisdom of the great? Therefore, it is precisely those without complete utility whom the spirit-like person deems most auspicious and good.

There was one called *Zhi Li Shu*, whose chin was hidden in his navel, whose shoulders rose above his head,
*[Subcommentary]* His limbs were disjointed, his body misshapen, so that his cheeks were hidden between his navel, and his shoulders rose above his head. His appearance was so deformed that he was named *Zhi Li* (Disjointed).
his crown pointed to the sky, his five organs atop his back, his thighs pressed against his ribs.
*[Subcommentary]* "Crown" describes how his hair stood upright. The five organs refer to the viscera. The viscera are located in the back of a person, and in ancient times, topknots were worn near the back of the head. Now, *Zhi Li*’s deformities caused him to bend backward, so that his viscera and topknot faced upward, while his thighs and calves were drawn up against his ribs.

By sewing and washing, he could feed himself;
*[Subcommentary]* "Sewing" refers to mending clothes; "washing" to laundering. He earned his living through menial labor to sustain himself.
by sifting chaff and winnowing grain, he could feed ten.
*[Subcommentary]* "Chaff" refers to small winnowing baskets. "Grain" means rice. He swept the marketplace, sifted chaff, winnowed dust, and sorted grain. Another interpretation: "Sifting chaff" refers to casting divination stalks, and "winnowing grain" to discerning the fine from the coarse in divination. Whether sweeping the market to support his family or selling divination to sustain himself, his earnings could feed ten people.

When rulers conscript warriors, the Hunchback thrusts his arms among them;
*[Annotation]* Relying on his uselessness, he does not flee into hiding.
*[Subcommentary]* When borderlands are troubled and brave men are sought, the crippled and infirm, unfit for campaign, remain fearless, thrusting their arms about as they wander—secure in their uselessness, they do not hide.

When rulers impose great corvées, the Hunchback, citing his chronic ailment, is exempt from labor;
*[Annotation]* Unfit for service, he is not assigned tasks.
*[Subcommentary]* When the state undertakes major forced labor, he, being afflicted with madness, is not made to fulfill its work quotas.

When rulers distribute grain to the ailing, he receives three *zhong* and ten bundles of firewood.
*[Annotation]* Though exempt from labor, he accepts gifts.
*[Subcommentary]* Six *dan* and four *dou* make one *zhong*. The ruler, pitying widows and orphans, showing compassion for the poor and sick, grants more to those whose bodies are severely deformed.

Thus, the Master Guo observes: exempt from labor, he accepts gifts.
One whose form is deformed may yet nourish himself and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose virtue is deformed?

*[Annotation]* The spiritual person is of no use to things, yet things each attain their own use, ascribing merit and fame to the multitude. In harmony with things and without advancement, they avoid the harms of the human realm, abiding in the substance of constant beauty. This is what it means to deform one’s virtue.
*[Subcommentary]* To deform one’s form is to forget form; to deform one’s virtue is to forget virtue. Yet even one whose body is deformed and crippled merely forgets form, for they are no sage and thus cannot forget virtue.

To forget virtue is to comprehend all things with wisdom yet return wisdom to folly, to illuminate the Three Luminaries yet restore illumination to obscurity. Thus, one may achieve success without claiming it, act without reliance, ascribe merit and fame to the multitude of beings, and merge with things without assertion—this is to forget virtue.
One who forgets form may yet nourish the body and live out their years, avoiding the harms of the human realm—how much more so one who forgets virtue? The disparity in their depth and excellence is such that they cannot be spoken of in the same breath.

Thus, one who deforms their virtue—surely this is the sage.
When Confucius traveled to Chu, Jie Yu, the Madman of Chu, wandered to his gate and sang:
*"O phoenix! O phoenix! How has virtue so declined?"*

*[Annotation]* One should follow the times and proceed directly, fulfilling what is fitting in the moment.
The rise and fall of the world are too subtle to perceive, hence the question: *How has it so declined?*
*[Subcommentary]* *How* means *in what manner*. *Declined* means *to reach*. When Confucius journeyed from Lu to Chu, he lodged at an inn. There was a worthy man of Chu, surnamed Lu, named Tong, styled Jie Yu, who knew of Confucius’s travels and sang to mock him:
*"O phoenix! O phoenix!"*—thus lamenting the sage, likening him to the auspicious bird that appears when the Dao prevails. When the Dao exists, it manifests; when it does not, it withdraws. How could one harbor such sagely virtue yet travel to a realm of decline and disorder?

*"Future ages cannot be awaited; past ages cannot be pursued."*
*[Annotation]* One should hasten to fulfill what is fitting in the present moment.
*[Subcommentary]* The ages to come, with rulers who embrace the Dao and might be served, are as fleeting as a galloping horse—thus, they cannot be awaited. The ages past, with sage-kings like Yao and Shun, have long since transformed—thus, they cannot be sought. One should hasten to fulfill what is fitting in the present, without straining to look ahead or behind.

*"When the world has the Dao, the sage achieves; when the world lacks the Dao, the sage survives."*
*[Annotation]* Entrusting oneself to what is so, principle naturally achieves or survives. Neither achievement nor survival is of my doing—how could order or chaos alter one’s resolve? Order seeks achievement, thus one may relinquish achievement without failure; chaos seeks survival, thus one may forget survival without perishing.
*[Subcommentary]* In an enlightened ruler’s reign, a time of brilliance, the sage expands the Dao and establishes teaching, bringing achievement to the world. When encountering a benighted ruler, an age of desolation, one may only preserve life and avoid harm, concealing brilliance and obscuring traces.

*"In this present age, one barely escapes punishment."*
*[Annotation]* Without looking ahead or behind, one fully meets the demands of the present moment, merging obscurely with the times to attain perfect harmony, thus escaping punishment.
*[Subcommentary]* *Present* means *current*. Now, in this age of ruin and the declining Zhou, with cautious conduct and guarded speech, one barely escapes execution—yet to grasp the reins and respond to summons is surely delusional. These are Jie Yu’s words, mocking Confucius.

*"Fortune is lighter than a feather, yet none know how to bear it;*
*[Annotation]* Feet can walk yet are left idle; hands can grasp yet are left unburdened. One listens to what the ears hear, sees what the eyes see, knows to stop at what they do not know, and acts only within their capacity. Using what is naturally used, doing what is naturally done, indulging one’s nature without the slightest encumbrance from what lies beyond—this is the utmost ease of non-action. Yet no one whose nature and destiny remain unfulfilled through non-action has ever existed; and if nature and destiny are fulfilled, it cannot but be fortune. Thus, fortune is simply what was earlier called fulfillment—it is not borrowed from things, so how could it bear the weight of a goose feather?

To move in accordance with one’s nature, never exceeding its bounds, is the utmost ease in the world. To lift what lifts itself, to bear what bears itself, is the utmost lightness in the world. Yet knowing with boundless knowledge harms one’s nature, and the heart, swayed by likes and dislikes, scatters one’s authenticity. Thus, people abandon this utmost ease of non-action to pursue the utmost difficulty of action, discard this utmost lightness of self-lifting to take up the utmost burden of bearing others—this is the common folly of the world.

*"Misfortune is heavier than the earth, yet none know how to avoid it."*
*[Annotation]* To lift what lies within one’s nature, even if bearing ten thousand *jun*, one does not feel its weight; to entrust oneself to external things, even if the burden is no more than a *zhu*, one may yet be unequal to it. To act from within is fortune—thus, fortune is supremely light.

To act from without is misfortune—thus, misfortune is supremely heavy. Yet misfortune, though heavier than the earth, none know how to avoid: this is the world’s great delusion.

*[Annotation]* Now, seeing and hearing, knowing and ability, each have their limits. To abide within one’s limits is to preserve life; to seek beyond them is to court early death. Preserving life is thus fortune, while early death is misfortune. Yet the fortune that lies within one’s limits is lighter than a goose feather, and those who vie for honor and gain do not know it is borne within themselves. The misfortune that lies beyond one’s limits is heavier than the earth, yet the deluded, clinging fast, do not know to shun it from themselves. This is the common affliction of the vulgar world—thus, the text invokes Confucius and Lu to reveal its burden.

*"Enough! Enough! Meet others with virtue.
Danger! Danger! Trace the line and follow it."*

*[Annotation]* To trace a line upon the ground and bid others follow it is to make plain what lies near; to possess oneself and stand above things is to be at odds with them. Thus, the great person does not illumine me to dazzle others but lets others find their own illumination; does not impose me upon others but lets each attain their own fulfillment. Thereby, they pervade and unite the ten thousand things, mysteriously merging self and other, and in silent oneness with all under Heaven, inner and outer share the same fortune.

*[Annotation]* *Yi* means to cease; *dai* means peril.

Confucius was born at the end of the declining Zhou, in an age of decadence and decline. Clinging to sagely advancement, he traveled through the states responding to summons, yet repeatedly faced rejection and slander. Thus, the repeated cry of "Enough! Enough!"—better to cease and not act at all. If one employs the Five Virtues to govern the people, imposing oneself upon others, it will only lead to peril and ruin. It is like drawing lines upon the ground and making others run along them—wasted effort with no hope of concealment. To impose oneself upon things follows the same principle.

"Lost brightness! Lost brightness! Do not harm my path."
*[Annotation]* "Lost brightness" means the absence of outward display. Abiding in solitude without being swayed by externals preserves the integrity of one's path. If all under Heaven preserve their own integrity, then all who claim the name of "self" will be preserved.

*[Annotation]* *Mi* means lost; *yang* means brightness or movement. Lu Tong exhorted Confucius to conceal his advancement and veil his brilliance, advocating the effortless non-action of solitary transformation and forgetting the discriminating wisdom of responding to things. Thereby, one remains within their proper bounds, and the path of preserving life remains unharmed.

"My path winds through hollows—do not harm my feet."
*[Annotation]* When the path bends to completion, each is self-sufficient.

*[Annotation]* *Bu* means emptiness; *qu* means compliance. Emptying the mind and following the nature of things, each who claims the name of "self" becomes self-sufficient.

Mountain trees bring ruin upon themselves; fat burns itself in the flame.
*[Annotation]* *Kou* means to fell. Trees in the mountains—cedars and catalpas—are valued for their usefulness and thus suffer felling. Fat provides bright illumination when used for torches, and for its usefulness, it is consumed by fire. Not only fat and wood—so too with people. Cinnamon is edible, so it is cut down; lacquer is useful, so it is tapped.

*[Annotation]* Cinnamon’s heart is pungent and fragrant, so it is felled; lacquer is used for vessels, so it is tapped. Both are valued for their utility and thus meet their end by axe and blade. People know the usefulness of what is useful but do not know the usefulness of what is useless.

*[Annotation]* What is useful serves others; what is useless preserves one’s own life. Those who cut their flesh for the world are known by the world. To allow the people to preserve their own integrity while both self and other are at ease—this is a joy so subtle one does not sense its wonder within.

*[Annotation]* The cedar, cypress, orange, and lacquer—these are useful. The crooked-trunked tree, the tree of Shangqiu, the white-foreheaded ox, the snub-nosed pig—these are useless. Yet the world flaunts its talents as the usefulness of the useful, unaware that the fragmentation of virtue is the usefulness of the useless. Thus, as Guo’s commentary states: "What is useful serves others; what is useless preserves one’s own life."

**Annotations and Commentary on the Southern Florescence Scripture (Nanhua Zhenjing Zhushu), Scroll Six**
*Guo Xiang of Henan, Annotation*

**Tang Dynasty Master of Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying’s Subcommentary**
*Inner Chapters, "Virtue’s Full Manifestation" (Dechongfu), Fifth*

Virtue fills the inner, things respond to the outer—outer and inner merge in mystery, as if tallying with destiny yet transcending it. Such is his physical form.

In Lu there was a foot-amputee named Wang Fu.
**[Subcommentary]** Surnamed Wang, given name Chi, a man of Lu. To be amputated of one foot is called *wu* (兀). Though his form was maimed and incomplete, his heart was truly empty and forgetful, thus he heads the chapter *"Virtue’s Full Manifestation."*

Those who followed him in study were comparable to Confucius.
**[Annotation]** The number of his disciples rivaled that of Confucius.
**[Subcommentary]** *Ru* (若) means "like." Those who accompanied Wang to listen and learn were in number like those of Confucius.

Chang Ji asked Confucius, saying: "Wang Fu is a foot-amputee, yet those who follow him in study divide Lu equally with you."
**[Subcommentary]** Surnamed Chang, given name Ji, a worthy man of Lu. Wang Chi’s conduct forgot the outer form while his inner virtue was full, so those who followed him in study numbered three thousand, the same as Confucius, thus dividing Lu equally. Chang Ji, not yet grasping the true essence, therefore harbored doubt.

Standing, he taught not; sitting, he discussed not. They came empty and departed full.
**[Annotation]** Each attained self-sufficiency.
**[Subcommentary]** Though his disciples were many, there was never any instruction. Standing, he did not teach; sitting, he did not debate. They sought benefit with empty hearts and returned with full understanding.
**Alternative interpretation:** The unlearned and virtueless also came empty.
Is there truly a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form?

**[Annotation]** Marveling that though his form was maimed, his heart was full.
When the heart is whole, it transcends the body and form, forgets the five organs, and suddenly departs alone—yet all under heaven cannot part from it.
**[Subcommentary]** He taught his disciples without words or debate. Though maimed and incomplete, without further form, his profound Dao and perfect virtue filled his inner heart. Surely this is why the multitude followed him.

What manner of man is this?
**[Subcommentary]** Chang Ji marveled that though maimed, he gathered so many. To reveal the beauty of full virtue, he thus posed this question.

Confucius said: "This Master is a sage. I merely follow behind and have not yet gone to him. I shall take him as my teacher—how much more should those inferior to me?"
**[Subcommentary]** Xuanni addressed Wang Chi as "Master," replying to Chang Ji: "Wang Chi is a sage who embodies the Dao. You fail to recognize him, hence your doubt. I merely lag behind and have not yet gone to study under him. I shall revere him as my teacher and inquire of the Dao—how much more should those of later learning, inferior to me, do the same? To seek benefit and hold fast to his teachings is surely fitting. Why limit it to Lu?"

"I shall lead all under heaven to follow him."
**[Annotation]** When the spirit is whole and the heart complete, the body merges with things. One who merges with things cannot be distanced by all under heaven—how could it be merely one state?
**[Subcommentary]** *Xi* (奚) means "why." Why merely borrow Lu as a single domain? I shall guide all within the four seas to receive his abundant virtue, yet still fear I may not exhaust his Way.

Chang Ji said: "He is a foot-amputee, yet he surpasses Master Wang—his distinction from the common is indeed great."
**[Subcommentary]** *Wang* (王) means "abundant." *Yong* (庸) means "ordinary." *Xiansheng* (先生) refers to Confucius. That Wang Chi, a maimed man, had disciples attending him like those of the Master—marveling at this strangeness, he must differ from the common stream, and surely be far removed from ordinary people.
If so, how does he employ his heart uniquely?

**[Subcommentary]** *Ran* (然) means "thus." Wang Chi’s abundant virtue being thus, drawing all to him—how does he apply his wisdom and employ his heart in such a manner? Chang Ji, not yet comprehending, raised this doubt.

Confucius said: "Life and death are indeed great matters,
**[Annotation]** Though people are said to change, the change of life and death is the greatest of changes.
yet he does not alter with them;
**[Annotation]** He moves with change, thus life and death do not alter him.
**[Subcommentary]** Though mountains and boats may vanish, firewood and fingers shift—while all things undergo myriad changes, none is greater than life and death. Yet Wang Chi’s heart merges with the Creator, moving with transformation, traversing the human realm, accompanying life and death—thus he is not altered by what alters.

Though heaven and earth collapse, he will not lose them.
**[Annotation]** Even for a moment.
**[Subcommentary]** *Yi* (遗) means "to lose." Though the round heavens topple and the square earth crumbles, merged with safety and peril, he has never lost himself.

He examines what requires no borrowing,
**[Annotation]** Clarifying the constancy of nature and destiny.
and does not shift with things.
**[Annotation]** Letting things shift of themselves.
**[Subcommentary]** His numinous heart is serene, his wondrous essence true and original—aligned with the Dao, he is not altered by things.

He commands the transformation of things
**[Annotation]** Taking transformation as destiny, without marveling at its circuit.
and guards its root.
**[Annotation]** Not departing from the ultimate of perfect appropriateness.
**[Subcommentary]** Grasping destiny, merging with external things, he moves with transformation as one, acting without departing from stillness—thus he abides in the root.

Chang Ji said: "What does this mean?"
**[Subcommentary]** The meaning being profound and difficult to grasp, he further inquired.

Confucius said: "Viewed from what makes them different, the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue.
**[Annotation]** When the natures of tranquility and bitterness diverge, the feelings of beauty and ugliness turn their backs.
**[Subcommentary]** All things, however manifold, ultimately return to emptiness and stillness. Yet inverted distinctions, clinging to right and wrong, arbitrarily impose divisions within the profound Dao. How is this different from the gallbladder growing attached to the liver—both originally one body—while Chu and Yue lie thousands of miles apart? Within a single body, they create a division of thousands of miles. Those who see differences do so in every case.

Viewed from what makes them the same, the myriad things are all one.
**[Annotation]** Though what they find beautiful differs, they all find something beautiful. Each finds beauty in its own beauty, and thus the myriad things share one beauty; each affirms its own affirmation, and thus the world shares one affirmation. If one emphasizes their differences to make them different, then nothing in the world is not different. Yet the one who embraces the vast vision commands heaven and earth, encompasses the myriad things, and knows that difference is not truly different. Thus, emphasizing what they share to make them the same, nothing in the world is not the same. Further, knowing that sameness is not truly possessed, emphasizing what they lack to make them nothing, then right and wrong, beauty and ugliness—nothing is not nothing. To affirm oneself and negate others, to find beauty in oneself and ugliness in others—from those of middling understanding down to the crawling insects, none do not do this. Yet this is merely to be clear about oneself and unclear about others. As for the one of profound penetration and merged comprehension, they illuminate the world through the world. The world never says, 'I am wrong'—thus they illuminate the world’s lack of wrong; never says, 'that is right'—thus they illuminate the world’s lack of right. Without right, without wrong, all blends into one. Therefore, they can ride transformation and follow change, meeting things without resistance.
**[Subcommentary]** As for the one of profound penetration, embracing the vast vision, the Two Modes and the myriad things are like pointing to a single horse. Thus, they can forget cares and follow things, fully accord with the multitude of beings. Yet those who see sameness see sameness, those who see difference see difference. In the ultimate discussion of the wondrous realm, it is neither different nor the same. If this is so, then one does not even know what suits the ears and eyes.
**[Annotation]** Suitability arises from what is not suitable. Without beauty, without ugliness, then nothing is not suitable. Nothing is not suitable, thus one forgets suitability.
**[Subcommentary]** What suits the ears and eyes is what suits sounds and sights. Yet when the feelings of the moment make distinctions, clinging to sounds and sights, there arises what is suitable and unsuitable, permissible and impermissible. But one who gallops through the merging of the myriad things, darkly uniting life and death—how could they, amidst the roots and dust, harbor views of beauty and ugliness? Thus, they roam their heart in the harmony of virtue.
**[Annotation]** Completely forgetting suitability, thus nothing is not entrusted. Entrusting everything and not obtaining it—this has never been; not obtaining and not harmonizing—this too has never been heard. Thus, releasing the heart amidst the Dao and virtue, all is fittingly vast, and all is fittingly free.
**[Subcommentary]** Having merged the myriad things, not knowing what suits the ears and eyes, they can roam the realm of virtue and release themselves into the境 of the ultimate Dao.

Things see their unity and do not see what they have lost—seeing the loss of a foot as discarding dirt.
**[Annotation]** Embracing the wondrous heart of the utmost number, thus nothing is not the same. Nothing is not the same, then death and life, transformation—nowhere is it not oneself. Thus, life is my time, death is my compliance; time is my gathering, compliance is my scattering. Though gathering and scattering differ, I am always myself. Thus, life is merely myself—there has never been a gain; death is also myself—there has never been a loss. The change of death and life is still regarded as one. Having witnessed this oneness, then joyfully without entanglement, darkly uniting self and other, taking death and life as waking and sleeping, the body as a temporary lodging—departing life like removing a shoe, severing a foot like discarding dirt. I have never seen this ensnare their heart.
**[Subcommentary]** "Things see" means seeing things. One who unites life and death, things and self—life as my time, not seeing gain; death as my compliance, not seeing loss. Observing the myriad things, merging them as one, thus even the loss of a foot is seen like discarding dirt.

Chang Ji said: "He cultivates himself through his knowledge,
**[Annotation]** Suspecting that Wang Ni has not yet forgotten knowledge to preserve himself.
**[Subcommentary]** "He" refers to Wang Ni. Wang Ni cultivates his person and cultivates himself, still employing knowledge. It is suspected that he has not yet forgotten knowledge to entrust himself to solitude.

obtains his heart through his heart.
**[Annotation]** Suspecting that he has not yet forgotten the heart to obtain himself.
**[Subcommentary]** It is suspected that Wang Ni cannot forget cares to fully entrust himself, still employing the heart to obtain the heart. As for obtaining the heart—no thought, no deliberation, forgetting knowledge, forgetting awareness, like dead ashes or withered wood, utterly without emotion—placing it within the square inch, arising beyond seeing and hearing, equal to the Two Modes’ covering and bearing, following the Three Luminaries to illuminate, merging with dust and filth without disturbing the spirit, treading hardship and obstruction without stirring concern. Not obtaining is obtaining, and obtaining lies in non-obtaining—this is true obtaining. If one obtains it through the defense of heart and knowledge, it is not true obtaining.

Obtaining his constant heart—how could things gather around him?
**[Annotation]** Obtaining the constant heart is to be level in going. It is suspected that he cannot be level in going and thus passes with things, causing things to come to him.
**[Subcommentary]** "Gather" means to assemble. If one can be empty and forgetful, level and bland, obtaining the true constant heart, then one should certainly harmonize light and conceal brilliance, not differing from the common. How could one be uniquely different from things, causing the multitude to gather?"

Confucius said: "People do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water."
**[Annotation]** The stillness of water that allows reflection is not stillness sought for the purpose of reflection.
Thus, when the king gallops, the multitude gathers—yet the multitude comes of its own accord, not drawn by force.
**[Subcommentary]** *Jian* means "to reflect."
Still water retains its clarity, and thus reflects; the king gallops to gather the multitude because he embodies tranquility.
Still water has no intent to reflect things, yet things mirror themselves in it; the king gallops with no design to summon others, yet the multitude comes to him of its own accord.
Only stillness can still the stillness of others.
**[Annotation]** If one acts deliberately, one cannot abide in the stillness of all things.
**[Subcommentary]** *Wei* means "only." Only stillness—water’s inherent clarity—can still the lingering of men; the stillness of others is the coming of things to be reflected.
Just as the king gallops, embracing emptiness and tranquility, and thus can contain and still all beings, so too does his power draw the multitude to gather.
Receiving its mandate from the earth, only the pine and cypress remain verdant through winter and summer.
**[Annotation]** The pine and cypress are uniquely endowed with the qi of nature, and thus stand as the finest of trees—not through effort, but by inherent disposition.
**[Subcommentary]** All grasses and trees rely on the fertile earth. Yet those that possess unyielding strength and remain undiminished in the depths of winter—the pine and cypress, which preserve their verdure through all four seasons—do so by receiving qi naturally, not by deliberate intent.
The king’s gathering of the multitude follows the same principle.
Receiving its mandate from heaven, only Shun stands truly upright.
**[Annotation]** Those who uniquely receive the upright qi of nature are exceedingly rare: below, only the pine and cypress; above, only the sage. Thus, all that are not upright come seeking uprightness.
If all things were verdant, the pine and cypress would hold no distinction; if all people were upright, none would admire the great sage and turn toward him.
**[Subcommentary]** Humans receive their mandate from the three powers, their lives from the azure heavens, their forms round-headed and square-footed—yet their kind is vast.
Only one like Yu Shun, who embodies upright qi and unadulterated truth, stands apart—not by effort, but by natural endowment.
The king’s union with the Dao follows the same principle.
**[Master Guo’s Annotation]** "Above, only the sage": since the human head is above, severing it brings death; the root of a tree is below, severing it brings death. Thus, humans are called the "upper end," trees the "lower end."
The upper end consumes the side end, the side end consumes the lower end. The lower end refers to grasses and trees; the side end, to insects and beasts.
Fortunate to be upright in life, he thereby sets others upright.
**[Annotation]** Fortunate to be upright himself—not seeking to set others upright by doing so.
**[Subcommentary]** Receiving qi from the supreme mystery, he naturally embodies the upright Way—not by deliberate effort, but by fortunate spontaneity. Not only is he upright himself, but he also sets others upright.
Uprightness in self and others—self-benefit and other-benefit—perfects inner and outer conduct, and this is called the great sage.
Yu Shun was thus, and so too is the king who gallops. Yet Shun received the abdication of men, and thus serves as the exemplar.
The proof of preserving the beginning lies in the substance of fearlessness.
A single brave warrior, boldly entering the nine armies—
even one who seeks fame and binds himself to it, yet acts thus,
**[Annotation]** Not abandoning fame, yet capable of all undertakings.
**[Subcommentary]** *Zheng* means "to fulfill," "to verify."
The Son of Heaven commands six armies, the feudal lords three—hence, nine armies.
There may be one man, endowed with courage and martial prowess, who preserves the heart of a good beginning, fulfills the integrity of a steadfast end, harbors a will without fear, and displays a bearing of heroic might.
Even one who enters the nine armies to seek fame and rank, binding his heart to reputation and forgetting life and death—
how much more so the king who gallops.
The state of embodying the Dao is described below.
How much more one who governs heaven and earth, who stores the myriad things,
**[Annotation]** Profoundly embodying all without exception.
**[Subcommentary]** To govern the two poles is to "govern heaven and earth"; to contain the cosmos is to "store the myriad things."
If a brave warrior entering the army, merely seeking fame and rank, can disregard life and death, forgetting his own existence—
how much more fitting for one who governs the two poles and unites the myriad things, seeing death as life.
Simply lodging in the six senses,
**[Annotation]** That is, the inn of the transient.
**[Subcommentary]** *Yu* means "to lodge." The six bones refer to the head, torso, and four limbs.
The king who listens perceives that the body is not real, that the ten thousand existences are all true. Thus, he mingles the dust and filth of the world, lodging his spirit within form—yet this is but a temporary sojourn, not an attachment.
Resembling the ears and eyes,
**[Annotation]** People use ears and eyes, yet he too uses ears and eyes—not needing ears and eyes.
**[Subcommentary]** *Xiang* means "to resemble." Harmonizing light and merging with the dust, he seems to use ears and eyes, yet does not need them.
In the knowing of the One’s knowledge, the heart has never died.
**[Annotation]** When knowledge moves with transformation, there is nowhere it does not become profound—this is the knowing of the One.
When the heart follows life and death, there is no time it is not alive—this is the heart that has never died.
**[Subcommentary]** *Yi zhi* is wisdom; *zhi suo zhi* is the object of knowledge.
The wisdom that knows illuminates the object of knowledge; when object and illumination merge, wisdom and its absence become one.
Though traversing the transformations of things, the heart has never encountered death—how could it be confined or dulled in its midst?
He then chooses a day to ascend to the great transformation, and people follow accordingly.
**[Annotation]** His choice lies in not missing the moment; this man makes no choice, but moves with the heavenly course when the time comes.
Thus, those who borrow from him gather around him.
**[Subcommentary]** Does the king who gallops ever select an auspicious day to ascend the mysterious Dao?

Indeed, is it not so? One simply sets aside emptiness and tranquility, forgetting the heart, and thus attains union. The perfected man is without mind, like still water that holds a reflection. Yet the world’s false and hollow men follow him because of this. How could he ever take external things as his concern?

**[Annotation]** His serenity is so complete that his wholeness remains intact.

**[Subcommentary]** Only that royal embryo, darkly merging with the true and uniting with the Dao—false and hollow things naturally come to submit to him. How could he ever take them as his own task?

Shentu Jia was a man who had lost a foot. Yet he studied under Bohun Wuren alongside Zichan of Zheng.

**[Subcommentary]** His surname was Shentu, his given name Jia, a worthy man of Zheng who had lost a foot. His surname was Gongsun, his given name Qiao, styled Zichan, a worthy minister of Zheng. Bohun Wuren was the honorific title of their teacher. *Bo* means "elder"; *hun* means "to merge." His virtue stood as the elder among things, concealing his brilliance as if veiled, utterly forgetting both self and others—hence the name Bohun Wuren. Zichan and Shentu Jia both studied the mysterious Dao, though their stations in life were far apart, they shared the same teacher. Thus, these three are cited here to illustrate the meaning of virtue’s fullness.

Zichan said to Shentu Jia, "If I leave first, you stay behind; if you leave first, I will stay behind."

**[Annotation]** He was ashamed to walk alongside a man who had lost a foot.

**[Subcommentary]** Zichan held political power and enjoyed glory, wealth, and honor. Shentu Jia, his form maimed and incomplete, had lost all appearance of dignity. Though Zichan studied under Bohun, he had not yet forgotten distinctions, still clinging to favor and disgrace. Ashamed to be seen with a maimed man, he preemptively set terms to ensure they would not walk together.

The next day, they again sat together in the same hall, sharing the same mat. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, "If I leave first, you stay behind; if you leave first, I will stay behind. Now I am about to leave—can you stay behind? Or not?"

**[Annotation]** He pressed the question bluntly, wanting to ensure they would not walk together.

**[Subcommentary]** Zichan still harbored thoughts of honor and disgrace, while Shentu had forgotten all distinctions of noble and base. Though Zichan had spoken before, Shentu paid no heed, so they still shared the same hall and sat on the same mat. Seeing this, Gongsun pressed the question directly: "When you see one who holds office, you do not yield—do you consider yourself equal to one who holds office?"

**[Annotation]** He should have taken pride in his own office, so the direct question, "Do you consider yourself equal?" was enough to show his lack of deference.

**[Subcommentary]** Their paths in life were different, their stations in governance distinct. I hold office and am thus a man of rank; you are lowly and maimed in form—you should defer to me. Yet you show no humility, even seeking to equal me.

Shentu Jia said, "In the master’s gate, is there truly one who holds office in such a manner?"

**[Annotation]** This is a matter of virtue, not of rank.

**[Subcommentary]** The master is Bohun. At the master’s gate, where the profound mysteries are made clear, honor and disgrace are merged, life and death are equalized—how could one take pride in holding office in such a way? "Do you delight in your office and thus put others behind?"

**[Annotation]** He mocked his pride in his position and his desire to put himself before others.

**[Subcommentary]** You still delight in glory and take pride in your governance, pushing others behind while seeking to be first. With such an attitude, how can you be said to study the Dao?

I have heard it said: When a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if dust settles, it is not bright. If one dwells long with a worthy person, one does not err. Now, the greatest thing you have chosen is the master—yet you still speak in this way. Is this not an error?

**[Annotation]** To serve a clear master yet still not shed one’s petty and stingy heart—this is truly an error.

**[Subcommentary]** A mirror: when its surface is bright, dust does not settle; if dust settles, it is not a bright reflection. Likewise, dwelling long with a worthy person leaves no room for error; if there is error, one is not truly worthy. The greatest thing you have chosen is the master’s Dao. Yet the master’s Dao is to retreat into emptiness and forgetfulness, while you take pride in yourself, deeply contradicting its profound meaning. To speak as you do—is this not an error?

Zichan said, "Since you are as you are,"

**[Annotation]** As you are, maimed in form.

"you still contend with Yao in goodness. Do you not reflect that your virtue is insufficient?"

**[Annotation]** He did not look back at himself but sought to belittle one in office, comparing himself to one of virtue. Calculating his own virtue, it was surely insufficient to make up for his maimed form.

**[Subcommentary]** *Fan* means "again." Shentu Jia, maimed in form as he was, did not know himself but sought to walk alongside me—this is like contending with Yao in goodness. Though you have virtue, what is it worth? Even if virtue could compensate for your maimed form, it would still not be enough.

Shentu Jia said, "Those who justify their faults and claim they should not have perished are many."

**[Annotation]** Many declare their faults and argue that they should not have perished.

"Those who do not justify their faults and claim they should not have lived are few."

**[Annotation]** Few silently acknowledge their faults and accept that they should have died.

**[Subcommentary]** Those who display their faults, shifting blame to others, claiming they have no transgressions and should not have been punished—such people are many in the world. Those who do not display their faults, taking blame upon themselves, accepting that their faults mean they should not long remain alive—such people are few in the world. Zichan of Zheng, extravagant and self-aggrandizing, was just such a one in terms of righteousness.

Do you know that nothing can be done and yet accept it as fate? Only one of great virtue can do this.

**[Subcommentary]** *Ruo* means "to follow." This plain and maimed form was received as heavenly fate. Though one may know and calculate, nothing can be done about it—one can only accept and follow it, and all one’s actions will be fitting. Without abundant virtue, who could do this?

Amidst the target range of Yi’s arrows, the center is the bullseye—yet whether one is struck or not is a matter of fate.

**[Commentary]** Yi was a master archer of antiquity. The area within arrow’s reach was called the "target." When profit and harm contend, the world is full of archers like Yi. Those who do not abandon their bodies, forget their knowledge, and flow with things are all wandering within Yi’s target. Even if one ventures forth like Zhang Yi or retreats like Shan Bao, one cannot escape the bullseye—whether struck or spared depends solely on fate. Yet the petty-minded each encounter their lot and fail to grasp that fate is simply thus. Those who evade harm from arrows deem themselves skillful, exulting in their cleverness; when they cannot evade it, they resent their error, their will wounded and spirit shamed—such people have yet to comprehend the nature of fate. Our lives are not of our own making. Within a single lifetime, across a hundred years, from sitting and rising to moving and pausing, from stillness and action to inclinations and aversions, from temperament and intellect to all we possess—none of it is truly ours. The principle is simply thus. To arbitrarily generate joy and sorrow within it is to go against nature and lose oneself.

**[Subcommentary]** Yi was a skilled archer in the time of Yao. Wherever his arrows reached was called the "target." Yi’s skill ensured his arrows never missed; the target’s center was always struck, leaving no creature—beast or bird—unscathed. To escape by chance is a matter of heavenly fate. Struck or spared is not a question of skill or clumsiness. Those who do not abandon their form or forget their knowledge all wander within Yi’s target. Thus, Shentu Jia lost his foot to Yi’s arrow, while Zichan, physically whole, escaped by chance—neither outcome was due to human effort, so neither is worth self-congratulation. Many mock me for my missing foot, unaware of fate’s role in their laughter. Enraged, I seethed with anger—yet this too was ignorance of fate. Arriving at the Master’s abode, my anger dissolved, and I returned to myself. Was it the Master’s goodness that cleansed me? Or was it my own reflection? I forgot my form and shed my burdens.

I have wandered with you, Master, for nineteen years, yet you have never noticed my missing foot.

**[Commentary]** This is because he forgot form.

**[Subcommentary]** I wandered with Bohun in the Dao, plumbing the mysteries of yin and yang and the subtleties of the supreme principle. Having forgotten knowledge and form, how could he perceive my disability? Now you wander with me within the confines of form, yet seek me beyond it—is this not a mistake?

**[Commentary]** Form lies outside; virtue resides within. You wander with me in virtue, not in form, yet seek my outward appearance—is this not an error?

**[Subcommentary]** As Guo’s commentary states: "Form lies outside; virtue resides within. You wander with me in virtue, not in form, yet seek my outward appearance—is this not an error?" This note requires no further explanation.

Zichan, startled, changed his expression and said, "Say no more."

**[Commentary]** He grew weary of his own loquacity.

**[Subcommentary]** *Curan* means startled and ashamed. Zichan, unable to forget his attachments and desires, often spoke out of turn. Rebuked, he was taken aback, altering his proud demeanor to one of humility. Realizing his error, he ceased speaking.

In Lu there was a man without toes named Shushan Wuzhi, who approached Confucius on his heels.

**[Commentary]** *Zhong* means "to follow closely."

**[Subcommentary]** Shushan was his given name. *Zhong* means "to follow closely." Though maimed, this man from Lu retained a desire to learn, so he sought out a teacher to inquire about the Dao. Lacking toes, he was thus named.

Confucius said, "You were not careful, and already suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?"

**[Subcommentary]** You failed to cultivate yourself with caution, violated the laws, and already endured punishment, suffering hardship and disfigurement. What can be achieved by coming now?

Wuzhi said, "I was ignorant of my duties and recklessly used my body, which is why I lost my foot.

**[Commentary]** Life arises of itself by principle. To do nothing and let it unfold naturally is to value one’s body and understand one’s duties. To forget one’s natural life, act with caution, and take pride in it is to use one’s body recklessly and fail in one’s duties. Thus, the five organs contend within, and hands and feet are maimed without.

Now I come, and what remains is still that which honors the foot.

**[Commentary]** Losing one foot is not enough to diminish one’s virtue, for the body is but a temporary abode.

Thus, I strive to preserve it whole.

**[Commentary]** Abandoning caution and pride, allowing life to unfold naturally—this is how one strives to preserve wholeness.

**[Subcommentary]** Wuzhi was circumspect in his associations, valuing virtue over the body. Yet he sang only to borrow fame, unaware of the Way of preserving life whole. Thus, he violated the laws and suffered mutilation. Though his form was damaged, his virtue remained, so he repeatedly sought counsel to safeguard his moral integrity. Comparing virtue to form, he spoke of "that which honors the foot" as still present. *Present* means *existing*.

Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without distinction.

**[Commentary]** Heaven does not *act* to cover, yet it always covers; Earth does not *act* to bear, yet it always bears. If Heaven and Earth *acted* to cover and bear, they would sometimes rest. If a boat *acted* to float a man, it would sometimes sink. Thus, when things *act* for a purpose, they cannot endure to the end of their lives.

I took you, Master, for Heaven and Earth—how could I have known you were still like this?

**[Commentary]** This reproaches his lack of caution, for he falls short of Heaven and Earth.

**[Subcommentary]** Heaven and Earth nurture all, covering and bearing without partiality. The sage’s virtue aligns with these two forces, so he should likewise embrace all without rejection. How could I have known you, Master, would not overlook a maimed form? Is this truly the heart of one who saves others?

Confucius said, "I am but crude."

**[Subcommentary]** What Confucius offered was no more than the teachings of the sages. Wuzhi sought instruction in preserving life whole, and my shallow response to his profound question only revealed my crudeness.

"Why do you not enter?" he asked. "Let me share what I have heard."

Wuzhi departed.

**[Commentary]** He heard what he heard and left, preserving his non-action.

**[Subcommentary]** *Master* refers to Wuzhi. *Why* means *how*. Confucius, humbled by his own crudeness, felt deep shame and deferred to Wuzhi, inviting him in to expound on the teachings of the human realm. Yet after lingering too long, repeating worn-out doctrines like straw dogs, Wuzhi, weary of hearing them, silently withdrew.

Confucius said, "Disciples, take heed. Even Wuzhi, a maimed man, still strives to learn and redress his past wrongs—how much more should those whose virtue is whole?"

**[Commentary]** One whose virtue is whole forgets life from the moment of birth.

**[Subcommentary]** *Take heed* means *exert yourselves*. Even Wuzhi, though maimed, still seeks to preserve life whole and amend his past errors. How much more should the worthy and the virtuous, whose form and virtue are both intact, forget life and death, their inner power overflowing? You, my disciples, should be urged to do the same.

Wuzhi said to Lao Dan, "Is Confucius not yet a perfected man? Why does he so deferentially treat you as his teacher?"

**[Commentary]** He marvels that Confucius would still study under Lao Dan, as if ashamed.

**[Subcommentary]** *Deferentially* describes his reverent manner. The man of profound virtue fathoms the ultimate mysteries, transcends words and learning, and follows his nature with innate knowledge. Yet Confucius clings to texts, pursues the path of the sages, and humbly seeks instruction from Lao Dan. By your standards, he has not yet attained perfection—why does he study under you?

"Does he not seek strange and fantastical fame, unaware that the perfected man uses such things as his own shackles?"

**[Commentary]** The man without fixed intentions learns when others learn. Yet the ancients learned for themselves, while men today learn for others. This flaw leads them to do what others do. Those who teach others to attain self-realization follow what is constant; those who abandon themselves to imitate others and chase external things seek extraordinary fame. Yet extraordinary fame arises from what is constant. Thus, the learner does not seek the fantastical—fantastical things arise from learning. Ritual is not for ornamentation—yet ornamentation arises from ritual. This is the principle the perfected man cannot help but accept, so he treats such things as his own fetters.

**[Subcommentary]** *Seek* means *pursue*. *Strange and fantastical* means *bizarre and cunning*. *Shackles* refers to restraints: those for the hands are called *gui*, and those for the feet are called *ju*—what we now call *fetters*. That Confucius, bound to the path of the sages, studies bizarre and cunning things, chasing illusory fame—does he not know that the man who embodies the Dao beyond the world uses such teachings as his own bonds?

Lao Dan said, "Why not simply lead him to see life and death as a single thread, right and wrong as a single strand, and thus free him from his shackles?"

**[Commentary]** He wishes to guide him with direct principle, hoping he will cease his striving.

**[Subcommentary]** When Wuzhi previously met Confucius, why did he not urge him to forget benevolence and righteousness, merge life and death, and equalize right and wrong? Once these distinctions dissolve, the bonds will loosen—would this not free him from his fetters?

Wuzhi said, "Heaven has punished him—how can it be undone?"

**[Commentary]** Confucius is not unenlightened. Yet the principle of nature is such that actions cast shadows, and words echo. To follow things is to establish fame, yet following things is not for fame. If not for fame, one attains perfection—yet fame cannot be avoided. Who, then, can free him from it? Fame is but an echo and shadow, and echoes and shadows are the shackles of form and sound. Understanding this, fame can be forgotten; forgetting fame, the pursuit of externals can be severed; severing the pursuit of externals, one’s nature and life can be preserved whole.

**[Subcommentary]** Confucius revered the laws of Wen and Wu, followed the ways of Yao and Shun, edited the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, established rituals and music, endured hardship in Chen and Cai, and was besieged in Shang and Zhou. Clinging to benevolence and righteousness, he suffered humiliation and punishment.

Just as movement brings shadows in tow and speech elicits echoes in response, this is the natural course, the fitting consequence that must follow. Thus, once contention arises, flaws and strife inevitably emerge—how could one avoid exhaustion and ruin? Therefore, the punishment of Heaven’s natural law cannot be undone.

Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius: “In Wei there was an ugly man named Ai Taituo.” **[Annotation]** *E* 恶 means "ugly." **[Subcommentary]** *E* 恶 means "ugly." It is said that in the state of Wei there was a man whose appearance was grotesque, yet his inner virtue was full, and he was revered by the common people. Duke Ai, hearing of his ugliness, took it as his name. Wherever men dwelled with him, they longed for him and could not bear to leave. When women saw him, they pleaded with their parents, saying, “I would rather be this man’s concubine than another’s wife”—and this occurred ten times over without cease. **[Subcommentary]** A *wife* (妻) is one who stands equal (齐) to her husband; a *concubine* (妾) is one who merely attends (接) to the gentleman. Ai Taituo’s talent was complete and his virtue full, so all things turned to him as their refuge. He so perfectly accorded with all beings that they forgot his ugliness. Thus, men who lived with him cherished him and could not bring themselves to depart, while women, admiring his talent and virtue, vied to become his concubines. That this occurred ten times without cease shows how many were drawn to his righteousness; that none sought to be his wife demonstrates how his Dao could move all things.

He never initiated speech but only responded to others. **[Subcommentary]** He concealed his brilliance and concealed his beginnings, humbly placing himself behind others. He merely answered in harmony, never leading or provoking speech.

He held no lordly position to save others from death. **[Annotation]** This shows that people did not follow him because of authority. **[Subcommentary]** A lord is one who can pardon transgressions, absolve crimes, and protect life. Yet Ai Taituo, though poor and a commoner, held no throne, no power, no authority to aid others—showing that his appeal did not stem from might.

He had no wealth to fill others’ bellies. **[Annotation]** This shows that people did not follow him for food. **[Subcommentary]** Storing grain in granaries and amassing wealth is how one attracts followers, hoping to fill their stomachs. Yet Ai Taituo had no such wealth—how then could he draw people? This shows that they were drawn to his righteousness, not to food.

Moreover, his ugliness shocked the world. **[Annotation]** This shows that people did not follow him for his appearance. **[Subcommentary]** Ai Taituo’s form was extraordinarily vile; his ugliness startled all under Heaven. This makes clear that the crowds did not gather because of his beauty.

He harmonized but did not lead. **[Annotation]** He did not summon them but was sought. **[Subcommentary]** Like the echo in a deep valley, he responded without intent, never using words to entice or provoke, never initiating speech before others.

His knowledge did not extend beyond the four bounds. **[Annotation]** He did not exert his thoughts beyond his proper sphere. **[Subcommentary]** *Bounds* (域) means "limits." With a mind free of contrivance and a nature true to itself, he never strained his thoughts or extended his concerns beyond the four directions.

Yet male and female creatures gathered before him. **[Annotation]** One whose talent is complete harms nothing, so when he enters a herd of beasts, they do not scatter; when he enters a flock of birds, they do not disperse. Thus, he becomes a forest and marsh for all things. **[Subcommentary]** *Male and female* refers to birds and beasts. A man of complete talent moves with all things, harboring no intent to harm, so creatures feel no fear of him. Thus, birds and beasts gathered before him.

There must have been something extraordinary about him. **[Subcommentary]** First, he had no authority; second, no wealth; third, no beauty; fourth, no persuasive speech; fifth, no far-reaching schemes. None of these things drew people to him—yet Ai Taituo was sought by all. Since he did not rely on these five things, this proves he was no ordinary man.

I summoned him to observe him, and indeed, his ugliness shocked the world. When he stayed with me, before a month had passed, I sensed something profound in his character. **[Annotation]** Before a month had passed, I already perceived his depth. **[Subcommentary]** Having heard of his extraordinary nature, I ordered him summoned. His appearance was indeed grotesque, shocking all under Heaven. Yet after sharing his company for no more than twenty days, observing his conduct and discerning his intent, I found his spirit serene and his insight far-reaching.

Before a full year had passed, I trusted him completely. When my state had no minister, I offered him the governance of the realm. **[Annotation]** I entrusted him with the state’s affairs. **[Subcommentary]** As days and months passed, my understanding of him deepened. Thus, after a year in his company, I placed my full trust in him. With no worthy minister to govern, I sought to enlist this worthy man and entrust him with the state’s affairs.

He responded only after a long silence. **[Annotation]** Neither favor nor disgrace could disturb his spirit. **[Subcommentary]** His delayed response was an unguarded demeanor, a sign of his emptiness and tranquility. Unmoved by profit or rank, how could he be swayed by worldly honors? Thus, he answered only after a pause, as if unaware.

His words were as if drifting. **[Annotation]** He spoke as others spoke. **[Subcommentary]** *Drifting* suggests an aimless, unanchored manner. Though unmoved by favor or disgrace, he remained humble and yielding, so his words were no different from those of ordinary men.

I felt ashamed and ultimately entrusted him with the state. Before long, he left me and departed. I grieved as if I had lost something, as if there were no one with whom to share the joy of ruling this state. What manner of man was he? **[Subcommentary]** *Ashamed* (愧) means "to feel remorse." *Ultimately* (卒) means "in the end." *Before long* (无几何) means "in a brief moment." *Grieved* (恤) means "to sorrow." *I* (寡人) is the humble title of one of the five ranks. Having met this worthy man, I felt my own shallowness and was moved by admiration. In the end, I wished to entrust him with the state’s governance and make him my chief minister. Yet in a brief moment, he fled and vanished. Losing such a worthy minister filled me with sorrow; my spirit was unsettled, as if something had been lost. Though I ruled the state of Lu, I found no joy in it.

The joy of his coming and the sorrow of his going moved me so deeply—what manner of man was he, and from what land, that he could affect me thus?

Confucius said: Once, when I was traveling in Chu, I chanced to see a piglet nursing from its dead mother. After a brief moment, the entire litter abandoned her and fled. They did so because they no longer saw their likeness in her, no longer found kinship in her. For the living recognize their kind by talent and virtue; when these depart in death, the living turn away, having lost their kind.

Thus, those whose virtue is profoundly rooted are like newborn infants—wherever they go, they remain as infants to the world. None in the world would harm them, for they have found their kind and made themselves known. If the heart shares kinship, even if the form differs, things will not harm it; if the heart lacks kinship, even if the form is that of mother and child, it is not enough to secure their bond.

**[Subcommentary]** Duke Ai recounted his feelings to ask Confucius, who answered with the parable of the piglet: I once led my disciples through the land of Chu and happened to see a piglet nursing from its dead mother. In the blink of an eye, after but a short while, they abandoned their dead mother and scattered in flight. They did so because they no longer saw their likeness in her. Thus, as Guo’s commentary notes, the living recognize their kind by talent and virtue; when these depart in death, the living flee, having lost their kind. This is like Duke Ai, who, possessing no talent or virtue, was not of their kind, and so was abandoned. Yet when talent and virtue are complete, as in an infant, the world’s affection is naturally secured. What is loved in a mother is not her form, but that which animates her form.

**[Annotation]** *That which animates the form* refers to talent and virtue.
**[Subcommentary]** As Guo’s commentary notes, *that which animates the form* is talent and virtue. And talent and virtue are the spirit. The piglet loves its mother for her spirit; the people admire their lord for his talent and virtue.

Those who die in battle are not buried with their armor;
**[Annotation]** *Armor* (婴) is what warriors rely upon. Those who die in battle have no use for armor—where would it be applied?
Nor are the shoes of the mutilated cherished;
**[Annotation]** Shoes are cherished for the sake of the feet. Here, the root is gone.
**[Annotation]** *Armor and shoes* rely on the feet and martial prowess as their root.
**[Subcommentary]** *Armor* (婴) is the adornment of warriors, created by King Wu—or some say by the Duke of Zhou. Its shape resembles a square fan, decorating both sides of a chariot. When generals lead troops into battle and die in the breach, their burials do not include armor. Thus, we know armor is what warriors rely upon, just as shoes are used by the feet, and form is animated by the spirit. Without feet, shoes are useless; without martial prowess, armor has no purpose; without spirit, form is unloved. Thus, armor and shoes rely on feet and martial prowess as their root, just as form relies on talent and virtue as its origin. Without these roots, both become useless.

The consorts of the Son of Heaven do not pare their nails or pierce their ears;
**[Annotation]** To preserve their form intact.
Those who take a wife keep her at home and do not send her out to labor;
**[Annotation]** Lest her form be harmed.
**[Subcommentary]** The emperor’s palace selects consorts with care, avoiding pierced ears or pared nails to prevent harm to their form. When a common man marries, he keeps his wife from external affairs, sparing her from labor to preserve her beauty. These analogies illustrate the importance of preserving wholeness.

If the wholeness of form alone suffices to elicit such devotion—
**[Annotation]** The selection of consorts and the joy of new marriage are based on the beauty of form.
Then how much more so for one whose virtue is complete?
**[Annotation]** When virtue is complete, the world naturally loves them.
**[Subcommentary]** *Thus* (尔) means "in this way." If the wholeness of form can humble the noble and move the chaste, how much more so for one whose virtue is complete? This concludes the analogy. As Guo’s commentary notes, *when virtue is complete, the world naturally loves them.*

Now, when Zai Wo arrived, he was trusted before speaking, befriended without merit, and offered the governance of the state—so eager was I for him to accept. He must have been one whose talent was complete and whose virtue was unmanifest.

**[Subcommentary]** Trust is built on words, and closeness on deeds. Yet Zai Wo was entrusted before he spoke, befriended without merit, and Duke Ai, emptying his heart, offered him the state’s governance, humbling himself in deference, fearing only that he would not accept. Such a man must possess complete talent yet attribute his achievements to others, so his virtue remains unseen.

Duke Ai asked: What do you mean by *complete talent*?

Confucius said: Life and death, survival and ruin, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, praise and blame, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the workings of fate. Their principles are fixed and inescapable.

Thus, human life is not a mistake; what life brings is always fitting. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things numerous, what I encounter is precisely what is meant for me. Even the gods of heaven and earth, the sages of the state, with all their strength and wisdom, cannot alter it. Therefore, what one does not encounter, one cannot encounter; what one encounters, one cannot avoid. What one does not do, one cannot do; what one does, one cannot refrain from doing. Thus, one must accept it as it is.

**[Subcommentary]** Though the two poles are vast and the myriad things numerous, what one encounters in life is precisely what is meant for them. The eight pairs mentioned above are the transformations of affairs and the flow of heavenly mandate—inescapable, unceasing, unshakable. One must submit to the unfolding.

What one encounters is always fitting. Unless one is a person of full virtue, who could achieve this? This reflects Confucius’ response to Duke Ai on the meaning of "complete talent." Day and night alternate before us.

**[Annotation]** The flow of fate and the transformations of affairs do not align with day or night; they cannot be pushed away, nor can they be halted. Thus, one of complete talent follows what is encountered and accepts it. Yet knowledge cannot plan for their beginning.

**[Annotation]** The beginning is not something knowledge can plan, nor is the past something emotion can cling to. Therefore, those who understand that fate’s flow is inexorable and affairs’ changes are inevitable—how could they scheme for endings by planning beginnings, or cling to the new by longing for the old? Even with the utmost knowledge, they cannot plan for it.

What has passed is gone—what can I do about it?

**[Subcommentary]** The flow of fate and the transformations of affairs are swift as a galloping horse; their succession and flux do not align with day or night. One after another, they cycle endlessly. Even with the utmost knowledge, they cannot be measured—how could one cling to the new or long for the old, plan for endings by scheming at beginnings? This is not the case. Only by following change and accepting transformation can one be free and at ease in all circumstances.

Thus, it does not disturb harmony.

**[Annotation]** If one truly understands the inherent constancy of nature and fate, then though death and life, poverty and success, undergo a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, one remains serene and composed, with harmony and principle abiding within.

**[Subcommentary]** *Gǔ* means "to disturb." Though affairs shift and fate alters, by following form and yielding to transformation, one remains serene and composed, undisturbed in the Dao of central harmony.

It cannot enter the numinous chamber.

**[Annotation]** The numinous chamber is the dwelling of spirit. The utterly sufficient do not allow cares to pass through their spirit like mere external things.

**[Subcommentary]** The numinous chamber is the dwelling of spirit—what is called the heart-mind. Through cold and heat, order and chaos, a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, one moves with things as they pass, never harboring intent—how could it concern the heart-mind?

This brings harmony and ease, allowing free flow without losing joy.

**[Annotation]** If one keeps harmony undisturbed and the numinous chamber at ease, then though one traverses the utmost changes, one does not lose this joy.

**[Subcommentary]** *Duì* means "joyful." Whether in poverty or success, life or death, one ensures that all encounters are harmonious and joyful, the center at ease. Through peril and safety, one remains joyfully self-possessed, never losing this contentment.

This allows day and night to continue without interruption.

**[Annotation]** To be utterly at one with it.

**[Subcommentary]** *Nà* means "interruption." Flowing and turning without cease, day and night unbroken, each thought linked to the next, without any gap.

And to be spring for all things.

**[Annotation]** To be what all living beings depend upon.

**[Subcommentary]** With compassion illuminating all life, grace extending to the moving and the still, one bestows kindness upon things, making all affairs like the verdant spring.

This is to generate timeliness in the heart-mind.

**[Annotation]** To transform in accord with the four seasons.

**[Subcommentary]** *This* refers to what was stated above. The person of complete talent aids and sustains all beings, nurturing the myriad things, responding to and following the seasons with a heart-mind that is no-heart-mind, illuminating by attuning to the moment.

This is called "complete talent."

**[Subcommentary]** Summarizing the above, this is the meaning of "complete talent."

What is meant by "virtue unmanifest"?

**[Subcommentary]** Having grasped "complete talent," one has yet to realize the meaning of "virtue unmanifest." Thus, the question is posed again, that the subsequent purport may be heard.

It is said: Levelness is the fullness of still water.

**[Annotation]** Of all levelness in the world, none is more perfect than still water.

**[Subcommentary]** *Tíng* means "still." Of all levelness in the world, none is more perfect than still water. Thus, the earlier text states: "People do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water." This is raised as an analogy to illuminate the meaning of "virtue unmanifest."

**[Annotation]** Being without emotion, it attains perfect levelness—thus the world takes it as the standard. Within, it preserves itself; without, it does not sway.

**[Annotation]** Within, it preserves its clarity; without, it is free from emotional falsity. Its profound mirroring penetrates all, impartial toward things. Thus it perfects its levelness and enacts its model.

**[Subcommentary]** Now, the nature of water is limpid and clear, mirroring all things. Though the master craftsman be skilled, without water he cannot level. Therefore, one who can preserve its clarity without rippling may serve as the rule for artisans, discerning beauty and ugliness with unobstructed vision. Hence the subsequent text states: "Water is level and serves as the standard; the great craftsman takes it as his model." How much more so the perfected person, who darkly unites with the Dao and harmonizes his radiance with things, serving as the pattern for the multitudes? Moving yet ever still, this is what is meant by "within, it preserves itself; without, it does not sway."

Virtue is the cultivation of completion and harmony.

**[Annotation]** That by which affairs are completed and things are harmonized is called *virtue*.

**[Subcommentary]** Who but one of abundant virtue can bring all affairs to completion and harmonize the myriad things? First, one must cultivate the self and establish conduct; only then can one complete affairs and harmonize things. Only when virtue is harmonious and I do not lose myself may it be called *virtue*.

"Virtue unmanifest" means things cannot depart from it.

**[Annotation]** Nothing is left incomplete, nothing left disharmonious—this is the unmanifest nature of virtue. Thus the world delights in exalting it without weariness.

**[Subcommentary]** One whose illumination rivals the sun and moon yet returns brightness to the dim, whose merit parallels creation yet ascribes achievement to things—this is the unmanifest nature of virtue. Thus one of profound virtue is likened to an infant; the world delights in exalting him without weariness, and nothing departs from him.

Duke Ai later told Minzi: "At first, I faced south as ruler of the world, holding the people’s guiding threads and fearing their death. I considered myself most penetrating. Now, having heard the words of the perfected person, I fear I lack their substance, have lightly used my body, and lost my state. Confucius and I are not lord and minister—we are friends in virtue alone."

**[Annotation]** One who hears the wind of virtue’s fullness, though he be Duke Ai, still wishes to cast off his bodily form and forget nobility and baseness.

**[Subcommentary]** His surname was Min, given name Sun, courtesy name Ziqian. A disciple of Confucius, he ranked among the Four Categories and was greatly filial—a man of Lu. *Yiri* means "another day." *Nanmian* refers to the ruler’s position. Initially, the duke was unenlightened, proud in his rule of Lu, holding fast to the state’s guiding threads and worrying over the masses, nurturing and instructing them lest they die young. By this governance, he deemed himself most excellent and penetrating. Now, hearing Confucius’ discourse and the meaning of talent and virtue, the Duke of Lu awakened and recognized his former errors. His penetrating words about fearing death now seemed illusory; his grand rule as a south-facing lord held no true record. Thus he cast off his limbs, dimmed his brilliance, relinquished rank, forgot titles, saw the state of Lu as a snail’s horn, and regarded his own form as a fleeting shadow. He befriended Confucius to perfect his virtue and honored him as Minister of Justice to distinguish their non-hierarchical bond. Thus we know the discourse of Zhuangzi and Laozi is lofty and pure, and the beauty of virtue’s fullness reaches this extreme.

When the hunchbacked, cleft-lipped man without lips spoke to Duke Ling of Wei, the duke was pleased; yet when he saw a whole person, his neck seemed slender. When the man with a jar-like goiter spoke to Duke Huan of Qi, the duke was pleased; yet when he saw a whole person, his neck seemed slender.

**[Annotation]** With partial emotion and one-sided attachment, the ugly appears more pleasing and the pleasing more ugly.

**[Subcommentary]** *Chǎn* means crooked—walking with a hunched, swollen gait. *Chún* means lips—his limbs were cracked and split, his body maimed and diseased, and he lacked lips. *Wèng* means jar. *Dòu* means neck. *Jiānjiān* describes something thin and small. The man with disjointed limbs walked on tiptoe; the man with a goiter had a growth as large as a jar.

These two men embodied the utmost ugliness under heaven, yet both could transcend form to establish virtue, embody their Dao, and discourse on the profound. Thus they moved the lords of Qi and Wei to revere their influence and delight in their presence, admiring their abundant virtue—unaware of deformity or ugliness, and turning to regard the necks of whole men as if they were thin and small.

For where virtue excels, form is forgotten.
**[Annotation]** When virtue excels in harmonizing with things, others forget their ugliness; when it excels in opposing things, others forget their beauty.

**[Subcommentary]** Though emaciated and maimed, their virtue was vast and far-reaching, so that the lords of Qi and Wei forgot their physical repulsiveness. Yet men forget what should be forgotten and remember what should not—this is called true forgetting.

**[Annotation]** They cherish life but discard the dead.

Thus virtue is what the world does not forget, while form is what principle does not preserve. Therefore, to forget form is not true forgetting; only to remember form while forgetting virtue is true forgetting.

**[Subcommentary]** *Chéng* means real. What is forgotten is form; what is not forgotten is virtue. Forgetting form is easy, forgetting virtue is difficult—hence form is called "what should be forgotten," and virtue "what should not be forgotten." To remember form while forgetting virtue is true forgetting. This is the meaning of virtue transcending form.

Thus the sage wanders freely,
**[Annotation]** Wandering in the realm of self-attainment, unfettered and boundless—his talent and virtue are complete.

**[Subcommentary]** Abandoning both self and things, forgetting both form and virtue, he roams the field of transformation and soars in the realm of ultimate emptiness.

Yet knowledge becomes a snare, restraint a glue, virtue a bond, and craft a merchant.
**[Annotation]** These four arise naturally from one another; their principle is already complete.

**[Subcommentary]** The perfected one’s Dao transcends the Three Clarities and his spirit roams the Six Directions. Thus he wields wisdom to dispel calamity, imposes restraint to curb distraction, cultivates virtue to embrace all beings, and employs skill to benefit all creatures. These four exist among the common people, yet the great sage, in his compassion, harmonizes with the dust and follows things.

The sage does not scheme—why employ knowledge? He does not sever—why employ glue? He suffers no loss—why employ virtue? He does not trade—why employ commerce?
**[Annotation]** Nature is already complete.

Thus the sage has no use for his own abilities.
**[Subcommentary]** *Wū* means "why." The perfected one does not scheme against calamity—why use wisdom? He does not carve or destroy—why use restraint? He has not lost the Dao—why employ virtue? He does not value rare goods—why labor as a merchant? All this is to harmonize with the light and blend with things, hence their existence.

These four are the fasting of the heavens. The fasting of the heavens is the food of the heavens.
**[Annotation]** They are naturally endowed.

**[Subcommentary]** *Cháng* means "to eat." *Shí* means "to examine." *Tiān* means "nature." The preceding four exist among the people, endowed by nature, each following its own nature. The sage complies with them, thus having no use for his own abilities. Having received sustenance from heaven, why employ man?

**[Annotation]** When endowment is natural, its principle is already sufficient. Though one may ponder deeply to avoid disaster or clearly admonish to evade misfortune, nothing occurs without reason—all are the convergence of heaven and earth, the direction of ultimate principle. Whether one ponders and escapes, or ponders and does not escape; whether one does not ponder and escapes, or does not ponder and does not escape—none of this is of me. What is there to do? Let it be, and it will come of itself.

**[Subcommentary]** Endowment is natural, each with its fixed portion. Why add extraneous human sentiment? To defy heaven and rely on man is to invite regret.

He has the form of a man,
**[Annotation]** His appearance resembles that of a man.

Yet lacks the feelings of a man.
**[Annotation]** Like the branch of a withered tree.

**[Subcommentary]** The sage, dwelling in the world, bears the form of a living being; embodying the Dao in emptiness, he is free from the feelings of right and wrong. Having the form of a man, he mingles with men,
**[Annotation]** Like attracts like, and kind gathers with kind—this is the natural way.

**[Subcommentary]** Harmonizing with the light and blending with the dust, he gathers among the worldly. This explains "having the form of a man."

Lacking the feelings of a man, right and wrong cannot adhere to him.
**[Annotation]** Without feelings, he entrusts all to things.

**[Subcommentary]** Like the numinous immortals, devoid of consciousness; having forgotten both self and things, how can right and wrong exist? This explains "lacking the feelings of a man."

How minute and small—thus he belongs to mankind.
**[Annotation]** His form resembles that of a man.

**[Subcommentary]** *Shǔ* means "to belong." Pitiful and constrained, his form is bound to the human realm, no different from other things—hence he is called minute and small. This concludes the meaning of "having the form of a man."

How vast and great—alone he completes his heaven.
**[Annotation]** Without feelings, he is vast and unfettered, unrestrained in all things. What the emotional cannot achieve, he achieves without feelings—thus alone he completes his heaven.

**[Subcommentary]** *Jǐng* means "lofty and great." Vast and boundless, he forgets all realms; his wisdom and virtue are profound, his illumination far-reaching. Thus he surpasses the noble and great, alone fulfilling the perfection of nature. This concludes the meaning of "lacking the feelings of a man."

Hui Shi said to Zhuangzi: "Do men truly have no feelings?"
**[Subcommentary]** The preceding text states, "He has the form of a man, yet lacks the feelings of a man." Hui Shi cited this to raise a question: Are those whom Zhuangzi calls "men" truly without feelings?

Zhuangzi said: "Yes."
**[Subcommentary]** *Rán* means "so." He affirmed the question, thus answering "yes."

Hui Shi said: "If a man has no feelings, how can he be called a man?"

**[Subcommentary]** If one lacks the wisdom of nature, how can he be called a man? This is Hui Shi’s further challenge to Zhuangzi.

Zhuangzi said: The Dao bestows upon him his appearance, Heaven grants him his form—how can he not be called a man?

**[Annotation]** Man’s life does not arise from feeling; what life knows is not what feeling knows. Thus, though one may feel the desire to become detached and free, he cannot; yet the detached and free attain clarity through their absence of feeling. Though one may feel the desire to become worthy and sagely, he cannot; yet the worthy and sagely become so through their absence of feeling. Is it only that the worthy and sagely are remote and the detached and free are hard to emulate? Even the dullest, the deaf, the blind, the crowing of roosters, the barking of dogs—none can achieve these things through feeling. Whether distant or near, even if separated by but a hair’s breadth, in the space between brow and eye, none can attain them. Thus, when the myriad things are considered, one returns to the self: the ears and eyes cannot exchange their tasks to succeed, nor can the hands and feet substitute for one another in their duties. When an infant first comes into the world, it does not seek milk with its eyes, turn toward light with its ears, grasp objects with its feet, or crawl with its hands. How could the hundred limbs lack fixed functions, the form and appearance lack an inherent master, and all be governed solely by feeling?

**[Subcommentary]** *Wū* means "how." The Dao of emptiness and penetration shapes his appearance; the principle of nature bestows his form. With both form and appearance, how can he not be called a man? Moreover, form and appearance are not distinct. The Dao and nature merely alternate in their phrasing. To clarify this meaning, the point is reiterated.

Hui Shi said: If he is called a man, how can he be without feeling?

**[Annotation]** He has not yet understood that form and appearance are not feeling.

**[Subcommentary]** If he is named a man, he must possess feeling and thought. If he lacks feeling, how can he be called a man? This shows that Hui Shi has not yet grasped that form and appearance are not feeling.

Zhuangzi said: This is not what I mean by feeling.

**[Annotation]** If right and wrong are considered feeling, then one who is without right and wrong, without likes and dislikes—though he has form and appearance—is merely a man; where, then, does feeling reside?

**[Subcommentary]** What I call feeling refers to right and wrong, self and other, likes and dislikes, resentments and aversions. If one is without right and wrong, though he has form and appearance, he is merely a man—where, then, does feeling reside? What I mean by "without feeling" is that a man does not inwardly harm his body with likes and dislikes.

**[Annotation]** To proceed directly according to what is fitting is not feeling.

**[Subcommentary]** When Zhuangzi speaks of "without feeling," he does not mean one is like wood or stone. Rather, he means one does not allow likes and dislikes to disturb his thoughts beyond their proper bounds, thus preserving his nature and inwardly ordering his body. Why is this so? It is the wisdom of storing emptiness and illumination—the feeling of no-feeling. One constantly follows nature and does not augment life.

**[Annotation]** To stop at what is fitting.

**[Subcommentary]** One follows the principle of nature as a constant; one stops at the limits of what one has received, not knowing the bounds of life.

Hui Shi said: If one does not augment life, how can he have a body?

**[Annotation]** He has not yet understood that life arises of itself and principle is self-sufficient.

**[Subcommentary]** If one does not rely on the Dao of augmenting life, how can he possess this body? This shows he has not yet understood that life arises of itself and principle is self-sufficient.

Zhuangzi said: The Dao bestows upon him his appearance, Heaven grants him his form.

**[Annotation]** The principle of life is already sufficient within form and appearance; one need only follow it, and the body endures.

**[Subcommentary]** The Dao bestows form and appearance, and the principle of life is already sufficient. One need only follow it, without need for deliberate effort.

He does not inwardly harm his body with likes and dislikes.

**[Annotation]** The feelings of likes and dislikes do not augment life; they only suffice to harm the body, for life has its allotted measure.

**[Subcommentary]** This returns to address the earlier question.

Now you externalize your spirit and exhaust your essence, leaning against a tree to chant, resting your head on a withered catalpa to sleep.

**[Annotation]** If the spirit does not rest within the bounds of one’s nature, it becomes external; if essence does not stop at the limit of one’s natural life, it becomes exhausted. Thus, when walking, one leans against a tree to chant; when sitting, one rests on a catalpa to sleep—this describes how those with feeling bring trouble upon themselves.

**[Subcommentary]** *Gǎo wú* refers to a lacquered armrest. Hui Shi has not abandoned the snares and traps of conventional learning; he is deeply attached to ordinary principles, externalizing his spirit and exhausting his essence. Thus, when walking, he leans against a tree to chant; when sitting, he rests on an armrest to discourse. In this way, his form is wearied and his mind fatigued, leading to weariness and sleep.

Heaven has chosen your form, yet you clamor with "hard" and "white."

**[Annotation]** All that you do—externalizing your spirit, exhausting your essence, leaning against trees, resting on catalpas, chanting and sleeping—this is what the world calls feeling. Yet to say "Heaven has chosen" makes clear that feeling does not arise from feeling, let alone anything else. Thus, though the myriad things take myriad forms, their actions and choices all arise within the absence of feeling—what use is feeling in such matters?

**[Subcommentary]** *Xuǎn* means "to bestow." *Wū* means "to speak." The Dao of nature bestows your form; whether short-lived or long-lived, beautiful or ugly, the principle is already fixed. There is no need for deliberate effort or augmenting life beyond its bounds. Yet you, endowed with a keen nature, dissect and clarify principles, clinging to your own virtue and flaunting it before others. How is this different from Gongsun Long composing the *Discourse on the White Horse*, claiming that a white horse is not a horse, rigidly upholding this argument to exalt himself? His words may convince others’ mouths, but they cannot convince their hearts. Now your boastful discourse beyond proper bounds is of the same kind.

*Annotations by Guo Xiang of Henan*

**Inner Chapters: "The Great and Venerable Master" (Chapter Six)**

Though heaven and earth are vast and the ten thousand things abundant, what they revere and take as master is the absence of intent.

To know what Heaven does and to know what humans do—this is perfection.

**[Annotation]**
To know what Heaven and humans do is to know that all is spontaneous. Thus, one releases the self inwardly and merges with things outwardly, becoming one with the multitudinous mysteries. Entrusting oneself thus, there is nothing one does not attain.

**[Subcommentary]**
"Heaven" refers to spontaneity. "Perfection" is the name for ultimate attainment. What Heaven does includes the three luminaries’ waxing and waning, the four seasons’ generation and destruction, the unfolding and gathering of wind and clouds, and the alternation of thunder, rain, cold, and warmth. What humans do includes grasping with the hands and walking with the feet, seeing with the eyes and hearing with the ears, discerning skill and clumsiness with the mind, and all actions thus undertaken.

To know what Heaven does is to know that all occurs of itself, unrelated to cultivation or creation, and not contingent upon knowledge or effort. Therefore, one releases the self inwardly and merges with things outwardly, gazing upon the boundless with vast equanimity, becoming one with the multitudinous mysteries. Having exhausted principle and fulfilled one’s nature, this is called perfection.

To know what Heaven does is to know that Heaven gives life.

**[Annotation]**
"Heaven" refers to spontaneity. That which acts cannot act, for action arises of itself. That which knows cannot know, for knowledge arises of itself. Knowledge arises of itself, yet it is not knowledge; not knowledge, yet knowledge emerges from non-knowledge. Action arises of itself, yet it is not action; not action, yet action emerges from non-action. Since action emerges from non-action, non-action is taken as the master. Since knowledge emerges from non-knowledge, non-knowledge is taken as the root. Thus, the true person abandons knowledge yet knows, does not act yet acts, lives spontaneously, attains through sitting in forgetfulness, and so knowledge is called absolute while action is said to depart.

**[Subcommentary]**
Clouds drift and rain falls, rivers and mountains, streams and valleys—none depend on human effort; this is Heaven’s giving of life. Both what can be known and the knowing of it are spontaneous. This explains the earlier statement about knowing what Heaven does.

To know what humans do is to use what one’s knowledge knows to nourish what one’s knowledge does not know, thus fulfilling one’s Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this is the flourishing of knowledge.

**[Annotation]**
Humans are born with bodies of seven feet yet possess the Five Constants. Thus, though the body is small, it is served by heaven and earth. Therefore, all things under heaven and earth cannot be absent for even a day. If one thing is lacking, the living cannot live; if one principle is unfulfilled, one cannot complete one’s Heaven-appointed years. Yet what the body possesses, one may or may not know; what principle requires, one may or may not enact.

Thus, what knowledge knows is little, while what the body possesses is much. What one enacts is scant, while what principle requires is vast. Those above cannot exhaust it to seek completeness. What humans know cannot be the same, nor can what they do dare differ. To differ is to become artificial, and once artificiality is established, the true is inevitably lost.

Some delight in knowledge without weariness, exhausting their limbs. What they delight in is but one limb, yet the root is harmed along with the branches. This is to use what one knows to harm what one does not know. As for the flourishing of knowledge, to know what humans do is to recognize limits, thus entrusting without forcing. To know what humans know is to recognize bounds, thus employing without excess. Therefore, if one does not exhaust oneself with the boundless, then within the body, knowledge and non-knowledge meet and unite to preserve wholeness. This is to use what one knows to nourish what one does not know.

**[Subcommentary]**
What humans do refers to the four limbs and the hundred parts of the body, each with its function. What knowledge knows refers to knowing color, for instance, and thus taking color as what is known. What knowledge does not know refers to knowing color but not sound, for instance, and thus taking sound as what is not known.

Yet the eyes see for the hands and feet, the feet walk for the ears and nose. Though there is no intentional mutual assistance, the other’s function is fulfilled. Thus, the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, four limbs, and hundred parts of the body serve one another, each with its office. The mind’s clarity and capacity also have limits; one employs what lies within one’s bounds and does not force knowledge. This is to use what one’s knowledge knows to nourish what one’s knowledge does not know, thus fulfilling one’s Heaven-appointed years without premature death. One who can do this may be called flourishing in knowledge.

Yet there is a danger.

**[Annotation]**
Though knowledge flourishes, it does not compare to abandoning knowledge and entrusting oneself to the ceaseless spontaneity of Heaven.

**[Subcommentary]**
Though knowledge is flourishing and beautiful, it still entails the burden of ceasing. It does not compare to forgetting knowledge and entrusting oneself to singularity.

For knowledge must await something before it is fitting.

**[Annotation]**
Knowledge cannot be without "can" or "cannot," and thus must await something. As for one who entrusts life to Heaven, one meets things and is fitting. What it awaits is particularly unsettled.

**[Annotation]**
To await something is to lack fixity.

**[Subcommentary]**
Knowledge must face an object before it is fitting. Since objects arise and perish without fixity, things also await and are seized without constancy. Only when both object and knowledge are forgotten, when both ability and what is acted upon are relinquished, can one be without "can" or "cannot," and only then can one be without ceasing.

How can you know that what I call Heaven is not human? That what I call human is not Heaven?

**[Annotation]**
My life has limits—this is Heaven. The heart desires to augment it—this is human. Yet this is merely what humans say; in things, nothing is not Heaven. That which is called Heaven is the natural. If all is natural, then order and chaos, success and failure, encounter and non-encounter are not of human doing but all are natural. **[Subcommentary]** Taking the near from one’s own body and entrusting the far to things, one knows that all functioning and application are nothing but the natural. Thus, Heaven and human share a single principle without duality. Therefore, to call it Heaven is to call it human; to call it human is to call it Heaven. The common crowd does not comprehend this truth. The "I" in these words is Zhuangzi’s self-reference, for here he merges human and Heaven, blending self and other. Only with the true person does true knowledge arise. **[Annotation]** With the true person, all knowledge under Heaven attains its truth and cannot be confounded. **[Subcommentary]** The sage, in perfect sincerity, merges with the true and unites with the Dao, forgetting self and relinquishing things. Embracing this sagely virtue, true knowledge then arises, and thus the true person becomes one without ceasing entanglement. The state of true knowledge is described below. What is the true person? **[Subcommentary]** This hypothetical question is posed to clarify the meaning.

The true person of old did not resist the few. **[Annotation]** If one does not resist the few in all cases, then what one follows is the many. **[Subcommentary]** "Few" means scarcity. Drawing from the ancients to guide the present, exalting the root and suppressing the branches, emptying the heart to embrace things, one accords with all living beings. Even if something is meager, one does not resist it. They did not dominate through achievement. **[Annotation]** They did not rely on their accomplishments to place themselves before others. **[Subcommentary]** Acting without reliance, growing without domination—how could they dominate through achievement, seeking to place themselves before others? They did not scheme for scholars. **[Annotation]** Following the heart’s direct course, the multitude of scholars naturally gathers; they do not govern through calculated schemes. **[Subcommentary]** With a mind empty and indifferent, scholars naturally flock to them, not because of deliberate planning or contrived efforts.

Being thus, they did not regret their errors nor take pride in their rightness. **[Annotation]** They simply preserved their wholeness and rightness without error; they did not weigh their minds with gain and loss. **[Subcommentary]** Though the time had passed, they harbored no regret or resentment; though their fate coincided with rightness, they did not take it as a personal virtue. Being thus, they ascended heights without trembling, entered water without getting wet, entered fire without feeling heat. Such is the knowledge that can ascend and reach the Dao. **[Annotation]** To say that knowledge can ascend to the Dao is to speak of such distance. The principle is inherently whole; it is not fear of death. Thus, the true person walks on land not to avoid getting wet, distances themselves from fire not to escape heat, and makes no errors not to ensure rightness. Therefore, though they do not take heat as heat, they never rush into fire; though they do not take wetness as wetness, they never tread in water; though they do not take death as death, they never lose their life. Thus, life—is it life because one makes it live? Achievement—is it achievement because one makes it so? Therefore, to entrust it to nothingness and yet not reach it is the true person. How could they harbor intentions toward what they encounter? **[Subcommentary]** "Trembling" means fear. "Wet" means moisture. "Ascend" means to rise. "Reach" means to attain.

The true person comprehends the non-duality of life and death, embodying the oneness of safety and peril. Thus, they enter water and fire without a second thought, ascend heights and tread perilous paths without fear or dread. Those of true understanding possess such abilities, ascending to the profound Dao, and thus attain this state.

The true persons of old slept without dreaming—**[Annotation]** free from deluded thoughts—and awoke without worry—**[Annotation]** content with whatever they encountered. **[Subcommentary]** Dreams arise from the delusions of emotion and intent. The true person, devoid of emotional concerns and free from discursive thought, thus sleeps in stillness without dreaming, and upon waking, remains ever at ease without sorrow.

Their food is not savored—**[Annotation]** they eat only as principle dictates. **[Subcommentary]** They partake of the world’s fare as one with the dust, undistracted by flavors, thus unaware of sweetness or delight.

Their breath is deep and serene. The true person’s breath comes from the heels—**[Annotation]** it arises from the very root. **[Subcommentary]** The heel is the base of the foot. The true person’s mind and nature are harmonious and unhurried, their wisdom illuminating and still. Even their breathing is slow and measured, issuing from the heels, revealing its profound tranquility.

The breath of ordinary people comes only from the throat. Those who are cramped and constrained speak as if stifled—**[Annotation]** their qi is not smooth and unobstructed. **[Subcommentary]** *Ya* refers to the throat; *wa* means obstruction. The common person’s heart-mind races and competes, their speech and breath emerging only from the throat. Agitated in spirit and hurried in qi, they cannot attain deep stillness. Their breath rises and falls in constraint, their qi unharmonized, their throat choked as if obstructed.

Those whose desires run deep possess but shallow natural mechanism—**[Annotation]** only when the root is deeply settled and the utmost tranquility attained does one return to oneness and absence of desire. **[Subcommentary]** Those who indulge in sensory pleasures and whose passions run deep do so because their innate mechanism is dull and shallow. How could this be so if their wisdom were profound and far-reaching?

The true persons of old knew neither delight in life nor aversion to death—**[Annotation]** they were one with transformation. **[Subcommentary]** When qi gathers, life arises—life is my time; when qi scatters, death comes—death is my compliance. Having merged with change, they harbored no joy or aversion.

They emerged without elation, entered without resistance—**[Annotation]** they accepted it all with equanimity. **[Subcommentary]** When the time came to be born, they felt no joy in compliance; when the time came to die, they offered no resistance to avoidance.

They departed with effortless grace, arrived with natural ease—**[Annotation]** entrusting themselves to the supreme principle, they came and went without difficulty. **[Subcommentary]** *Xiao* describes a state of freedom from attachment. Moving alone with transformation, they roamed in accord with principle. Though they died and were born again, they harbored no attachment or reluctance.

They did not forget their beginning, nor did they seek their end—**[Annotation]** having forgotten both beginning and end in transformation, how could they merely reverse their forgetfulness of life while still probing the meaning of death? **[Subcommentary]** The beginning is life; the end is death. Having relinquished both, they held to nothing. How could they forget only life while still seeking death? Beginning and end were equalized, and whatever they encountered was fitting.

They received and rejoiced in it—**[Annotation]** whatever they received, they met with perfect accord. **[Subcommentary]** They delighted in whatever they encountered.

They forgot and returned to it—**[Annotation]** their return was not through recognition, but through attainment. **[Subcommentary]** They returned to the state before birth.

This is called not using the heart-mind to abandon the Dao, not employing human effort to assist Heaven. This is called the true person—**[Annotation]** Humans are born tranquil—this is Heaven’s nature. Moved by things, they stir—this is the desire of their nature. When the things that move people are endless and human pursuit of desire knows no bounds, then Heaven’s principle is extinguished. The true person knows that using the heart-mind turns one from the Dao, and assisting Heaven harms life, and thus does not do so. **[Subcommentary]** "This is called" refers to the preceding text, summarizing its meaning. *Juan* means to abandon. The wisdom and power described above, which forgets life, may be said to employ no acquisitive heart-mind in discarding the Dao of emptiness and responsiveness. Nor does it use human distinctions to augment the natural order. One who can do this is called a true person.

If this is so, then their heart-mind and will—**[Annotation]** what they dwell in and find peace in becomes their will. **[Subcommentary]** If their heart-mind is as described above—unattached to the Dao and so on—then this is the will and resolve that enables such a state. Thus, the *Lao Jing* says, "Those who act with strength possess will."

Their countenance is still—**[Annotation]** though active, they do not harm stillness.

Their brow is unadorned—**[Annotation]** *Lei* describes the appearance of great simplicity. **[Subcommentary]** *Ke* means the forehead; *lei* means great simplicity. The true person descends into the world, their qi distinct from the ordinary. Not only is their wisdom illuminating and empty, their will vast and all-embracing, but their bearing is serene and refined, their appearance dignified and majestic. The radiance of the sun at the corner of the forehead and the mystery of the moon—such is this simplicity.

Cold as autumn—**[Annotation]** their killing of things is not for the sake of awe.

Warm as spring—**[Annotation]** their giving life is not for the sake of favor.

Their joy and anger correspond to the four seasons—**[Annotation]** Those who embody the Dao and harmonize with change share the warmth and severity of cold and heat, yet never do so with intention. Yet they possess the appearance of warmth and severity, the rhythm of life and death, and thus their joy and anger are named accordingly. **[Subcommentary]** The sage is without intention, responding only to what is encountered. Their majesty and kindness adapt to circumstances, their leniency and strictness meet the moment. Like autumn’s descent of frost, they are not intentionally severe; like spring’s nurturing of life, they harbor no deliberate kindness. Thus, the true person moves like thunder and stirs like the wind, trees flourish and flowers bloom. They embrace and sustain in accord with the two forces, their joy and anger corresponding to the four seasons. They are fitting for all things, yet none know their limit—**[Annotation]** without intention toward things, they do not violate what is fitting for them.

Thus, nothing is unfitting for them, and none know their limit.
**[Subcommentary]** The true person responds to the world, meeting stimuli as they arise, engaging with things always in accord with what is fitting. With an empty heart and compassionate love, they ever excel in saving others. Their measure equals the great void, and thus none know their limit.

Therefore, when the sage employs military force, they may destroy a state yet do not lose the people’s hearts.
**[Subcommentary]** Yao attacked Congzhi, Yu attacked Youhu, Cheng Tang overthrew Xia, and King Wu conquered Yin—all acted in accord with Heaven’s timing above and human affairs below. Thus, though they raised weapons to console the people and punish transgressions, though they destroyed states, they did not lose the joy of the common folk. Their beneficence flowed through ten thousand generations, yet they did not act out of love for others.
**[Annotation]** They destroyed what the people’s hearts desired to destroy, and thus did not lose the people’s hearts. The bright sun ascends the sky, illuminating the six directions—yet it does not illuminate out of love for others.

Thus, when the sage dwells in the world, they warm it like the spring sun’s natural harmony, and those who receive their grace do not give thanks. They chill it like autumn frost’s natural descent, and those who wither do not bear resentment.
**[Subcommentary]** They benefit things and spread their moisture like the spring sun—yet their influence extends not merely to one age but through ten thousand generations. Like straw dogs for the people, they harbor no partial affection.

Thus, one who delights in harmonizing with things is no sage.
**[Annotation]** The sage takes no delight; things simply flow unobstructed where nothing blocks them.
**[Subcommentary]** A mirror hung high in the hall reflects whatever comes before it, neither welcoming nor sending away—how could it have emotion? The great sage’s response to the moment is likewise.

To harmonize yet not lead is not what is meant by "delighting in harmony." Thus, one who is deluded by intent toward things is no sage.

To have partiality is not benevolence.
**[Annotation]** The perfected person has no partiality, abiding by principle and existing of itself.
**[Subcommentary]** The perfected person has no partiality; to have partiality is not to be perfected.

To follow the times is not wisdom.
**[Annotation]** One who follows the times is not as wise as one who forgets the times and naturally accords with them.
**[Subcommentary]** To observe the waxing and waning of celestial signs, to await the departure and arrival of Heaven’s seasons—this is but petty cleverness, not the mark of a great sage.

One who does not penetrate benefit and harm is no noble person.
**[Annotation]** One who cannot unify the path of right and wrong, who pursues benefit and avoids harm, injures virtue and burdens their own nature.
**[Subcommentary]** One who has not unified success and failure, who weighs benefit and harm and chooses between glory and disgrace, who clings to right and wrong—such a one cannot even achieve self-realization, how then could they be a noble person?

One who acts for fame and loses themselves is no scholar.
**[Annotation]** One who is good as a scholar forgets fame and attains self-realization; thus, their name matches their reality, and good fortune responds to their person.
**[Subcommentary]** To feign conduct in pursuit of fame is to lose one’s true nature—this is but a common person of the world, not a scholar of the Dao.

One who loses their true self and is not authentic cannot employ others.
**[Annotation]** One who loses their own nature and feigns compliance with things is much employed—how could they employ others?
**[Subcommentary]** One who feigns conduct and loses their authenticity, who pursues fame and loses themselves—such a one is but driven and employed by others, how could they employ others?

Like Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—these are ones employed by others, who follow others’ paths, yet do not follow their own.
**[Annotation]** These all conformed themselves to others, sacrificing themselves to harm.
**[Subcommentary]** Hu, styled Bujie, was a worthy of ancient times. Some say he was a worthy in Yao’s time who refused Yao’s abdication and drowned himself in a river. Wu Guang was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time, seven feet tall. Others say he lived in the Xia dynasty, ingesting herbs to nurture his nature, fond of playing the zither. When Tang offered him the throne, he refused and carried a stone to sink himself in the Lu River. Boyi and Shuqi were the two sons of the Lord of Guzhu in Liaoxi, descendants of Shennong, surnamed Jiang. When their father died, they yielded the throne to each other and refused to succeed him. Hearing that the Earl of the West was virtuous, they went to observe him. When they encountered King Wen’s death and King Wu’s campaign against Yin, Boyi and Shuqi grasped his horse’s bridle to remonstrate. When King Wu did not heed them, they hid in the Shouyang Mountains east of the River, refusing to eat Yin’s grain, and eventually starved to death. Jizi was a worthy minister of Yin’s last king who remonstrated but was not heeded, and was enslaved. Xuyu—Jizi’s given name. Another explanation: he was Wu She’s son, named Yuan, styled Zixu, a minister of King Fuchai of Wu. He remonstrated but was not heeded, had his eyes gouged out, and died, his corpse sunk in the river. Ji Ta, surnamed Ji, styled Ta, was a recluse in Tang’s time. Hearing that Tang had offered the throne to Wu Guang, fearing it would extend to himself, he led his disciples to drown in the Qiao River. Shentu Di heard of this and followed by throwing himself into the river. These several men all feigned emotion and false conduct, held fast to their lofty aspirations, and pursued fame beyond measure—thus they came to such ends. They starved themselves, shortened their lifespans, and though their fragrant names and fine reputations were transmitted in the historical records, they were but driven by others—how could they employ others? Delighting in the ears and eyes of the multitude, how could they follow their own nature?

The true person of old advanced in rightness yet did not form cliques.
**[Annotation]** They accorded with things fittingly yet were not partisan.
**[Subcommentary]** *Zhuang* means to advance. *Yi* means fitting. Descending into the world, they followed what was fitting for things, emptying themselves and equalizing all, never forming partial factions.

They seemed insufficient yet did not submit.
**[Annotation]** Empty and without surplus, they seemed insufficient; lowering themselves yet none did not rise to them, seeming insufficient yet not submitting.
**[Subcommentary]** Veiled and empty, as if their spirit and wisdom were insufficient, yet they followed the natural course.

They were ample yet not solid.
**[Annotation]** They ever wandered alone yet did not hold fast.

The *gu* means solitude. *Jian* means rigidity. Wandering freely and following their nature, they roamed at ease in self-contentment, traversing the realm of solitary transformation without clinging.

They were vast in their emptiness yet not florid.
**[Annotation]** Expansive and without attachment, they reached true substance.
**[Subcommentary]** *Zhang* means vast. Their spirit-realm was broad and untrammeled, equal in measure to the void, yet their wisdom and virtue were genuine—thus they were not florid.

They seemed joyous.
**[Annotation]** The perfected person knows no joy, yet their harmony and ease appear joyous.
**[Subcommentary]** *Liyou* describes a joyful countenance. Adapting to change and following transformation, they found contentment in all encounters. Though they had truly forgotten joy and anger, they seemed joyous.

They seemed compelled.
**[Annotation]** In movement and stillness, action and rest, they always dwelled in the extremity of necessity.
**[Subcommentary]** *Cui* means movement; *yi* means cessation. The true person, serene and still, responded to things without fixed method. Only when pressed did they act—not by initiating, but compelled to respond.

They were clear in enhancing my appearance.
**[Annotation]** They did not allow things to harm themselves.
**[Subcommentary]** *Qing* means gathering; *jin* means enhancement. With minds like still water, they could gather all beings. Thus, though they responded, they remained without attachment; though they bestowed kindness, it cost them nothing. Whatever suited or benefited them left their spirit and countenance utterly unharmed.

They were harmonious in halting my virtue.
**[Annotation]** They had no direction.
**[Subcommentary]** Though they moved in response to the world and engaged with things as circumstances arose, their demeanor remained at ease and non-active, embodying true virtue—what is called "movement that is ever still."

They seemed perilous.
**[Annotation]** The perfected person knows no peril, yet they moved in accord with the world, thus seeming perilous.
**[Subcommentary]** *Li* means danger. The true person was one with safety and peril, oblivious to fortune and misfortune, yet blending their light with the world, they seemed perilous. Like Confucius besieged in Kuang or King Wen imprisoned at Youli, though they faced danger, they did not abandon the work of non-action.

They were towering and beyond control.
**[Annotation]** Lofty and self-contented.
**[Subcommentary]** Their sagely virtue was vast and towering, transcending the world—thus it could not be restrained.

They seemed fond of seclusion.
**[Annotation]** Remote and profound, none could perceive their gate.
**[Subcommentary]** *Lian* means long. Their sagely virtue was distant and boundless, continuous and unfathomable. With minds like paths cut off, who could perceive their gate? In their dim silence, they seemed to have shut their doors, beyond hearing or seeing.

They were joyous in forgetting their words.
**[Annotation]** Unknowing and unperceiving, their heavenly mechanism moved of itself—thus they were joyous.
**[Subcommentary]** *Yue* describes a state of non-intention. At ease and non-active, empty and bland, they obtained the dark pearl at the Red Waters—thus they forgot words.

From this point onward, having displayed the true person’s virtues of self-cultivation and benefiting others, both inner and outer, the text now clarifies the true person’s methods of governing and benefiting the world.

They took punishment as their foundation,
**[Annotation]** Punishment is the foundation of governance, not something I impose.
and ritual as their wings,
**[Annotation]** Ritual is how the world moves of itself, not something I create.
**[Subcommentary]** Using penal law as the foundation of governance; employing ritual as the means to guide the world—these are the wings of things.

They took knowledge as their timing,
**[Annotation]** Knowledge arises from the moment’s movement, not something I initiate.
and virtue as their guide.
**[Annotation]** Virtue is what others follow, not something I enact.
**[Subcommentary]** *Xun* means to follow. Employing wisdom to illuminate the moment, they never missed the proper time; using virtue to engage with things, they humbly followed their nature.

The preceding was a brief outline; what follows is the explanation.

Taking punishment as their foundation meant they were magnanimous in their enforcement.
**[Annotation]** They entrusted execution to the natural course of governance—thus, though they executed, they were lenient.
**[Subcommentary]** *Chuo* means magnanimity. Using penal law as the foundation of governance meant using execution to halt execution, executing one to warn ten thousand—thus, though they executed, they were lenient and simple. Therefore, kindness is the people’s greatness, and law is the people’s father.

Taking ritual as their wings meant they acted in accord with the world.
**[Annotation]** Following what the world does, there was nothing they did not accomplish.
**[Subcommentary]** Though ritual is but the thinnest of loyalty and trust, it is the foremost means of governing the world. Thus, "without learning ritual, one has no means to stand"; "do not act without ritual, do not speak without ritual"; "a person without ritual—why do they not die in confusion?" Therefore, ritual is essential to governance. As the wings of human relations, it is how great deeds are accomplished in the world.

Taking knowledge as their timing meant they were compelled by affairs.
**[Annotation]** The mutual reception of high and low is an irresistible flow; the mutual positioning of great and small is a compelled circumstance. Expansive and without attachment, it is the repository of all knowledge. To receive the convergence of a hundred streams, to dwell at the pinnacle of guiding others—what is there to do? Entrust the world’s knowledge to the times, commit the necessary affairs to their inevitable course, and leave it to the world.
**[Subcommentary]** Responding to stimuli with the moment’s engagement, employing perfect knowledge to meet the times, there was no principle in which one could perceive the colors or sounds of seeing and hearing, yet affairs had their compelled circumstances. Thus, the master of the school was expansive and without attachment, entrusting it to the collective knowledge, dwelling in the convergence of necessity and riding it in play.

Taking virtue as their guide meant that, as the saying goes, "they accompanied those with feet to the hill."
**[Annotation]** The hill is the root. Speaking in terms of nature, it is the root of nature. Things each have their feet—they are sufficient in their root. Entrusting it to the self-following of the collective virtues, they accompanied those with feet to the root. When the root is reached, principle is exhausted.
**[Subcommentary]** The hill is the root. Using virtue to engage with things, they followed the nature of things. Each nature has its allotment; when the allotment is reached, it is sufficient.

To follow their fundamental nature is thus to reach the hill. Yet people truly believe this to be diligent practice.

**[Annotation]** All this is accomplished through that; its completion does not lie in oneself. Thus, though dwelling at the utmost extremity of myriad affairs, one remains ever at leisure, self-content, suddenly unaware of matters passing through the body, joyfully oblivious to words issuing from the mouth. Yet the great delusion of people is to truly regard the perfected as diligent practitioners.

**[Subcommentary]** The perfected move like drifting clouds and rest like the valley spirit; realm and wisdom are utterly forgotten, the empty mind responds mysteriously. How could they harbor intentions toward things or be emotionally bound to salvation? Yet the benighted, clinging to every path they tread, seeing the boat as the means for all beings and the pavilion as the nurturing of the multitude, truly believe the sage to be tireless in practice. Who knows the clarity and stillness upon the waters of Fen? Thus, the text says: *Who would take things as their concern?* Therefore, their liking is one, and their not-liking is one.

**[Annotation]** Always without mind and following that, thus liking and not-liking, approval and disapproval, are not two with that.

**[Subcommentary]** Having forgotten attachment to beauty and ugliness, they have also cast off love and aversion. Thus, liking and not-liking arise from the emotions of the benighted, while the wisdom of the sage remains empty and fused, never not one.

Their oneness is one, and their not-oneness is one.

**[Annotation]** Their oneness is the way of Heaven; their not-oneness is the way of man. The true person, in harmony with Heaven and man, equalizes self and other, not distinguishing oneness from not-oneness.

**[Subcommentary]** Oneness is the wisdom of the sage; not-oneness is the emotion of the benighted. Yet since the ordinary and the sage are not two, even not-oneness is subsumed into oneness.

Their oneness keeps company with Heaven.

**[Annotation]** That which is without exception one is Heaven.

Their not-oneness keeps company with man.

**[Annotation]** That which is "that" and "this" is man.

**[Subcommentary]** In harmonizing with Heaven and equalizing the myriad things, they form a kind with the mysterious Heaven. In "that" and "this," they keep company with the ordinary. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—this is called the true person.

**[Annotation]** The true person harmonizes with Heaven and man, equalizes the myriad conditions. The myriad conditions do not oppose one another, Heaven and man do not overcome one another. Thus, they are expansively without exception one, profoundly without exception present, and mysteriously identical with that.

**[Subcommentary]** Though Heaven is without self and other while man has these distinctions, when firmly examined, all returns to emptiness and quiescence. If Heaven were to overcome and man to be inferior, how could they be called equal? This further merges Heaven and man, profoundly equalizing victory and defeat. Those who embody this tendency may be called true persons.

Life and death are fate; their constancy of night and day is Heaven.

**[Annotation]** The constancy of day and night is the Way of Heaven. Thus, to know life and death is to reach the extremity of fate—it is not haphazard, but like night and day. What is there to cling to?

**[Subcommentary]** The alternation of dawn and dusk is the constant Way of Heaven; the coming and going of life and death is the allotted fate of man. Heaven cannot be without day and night; how can man be without life and death? Thus, to follow change and go with the flow—where would I cling?

That in which man has no part is the nature of things.

**[Annotation]** The true person in day has day, in night has night. Taking life and death as day and night, what is there they do not attain? Now, that in which people have no part and thus harbor sorrow and joy is merely the emotion of things, not principle.

**[Subcommentary]** Life and death, day and night, are the constant Way of man and Heaven, never not oneself. Where is there to cling? Yet the benighted go against creation, unable to rest in their time and follow the flow, to go along with change. They rejoice in life and abhor death, harboring sorrow and joy. This is merely the stagnant emotion of things—how could it be the penetrating wisdom of the true person?

They take Heaven as their father and still cherish it—how much more that which is transcendent?

**[Annotation]** Transcendent refers to spontaneous transformation. Among the achievements of interdependence, none surpasses the perfection of spontaneous transformation. Thus, that on which man depends is Heaven; that which Heaven generates is spontaneous transformation. All take Heaven as their father, thus the changes of day and night, the cycles of cold and heat, are not dared to be disliked; they follow and rest in Heaven. How much more the transcendent, spontaneous transformation, reaching the mysterious and dark realm—how could one not follow it? Having followed it, then life and death, change and transformation, only follow fate.

**[Subcommentary]** Transcendent refers to spontaneous transformation. The multitude of people, receiving qi from the azure vault, uniquely take Heaven as their father. They still cherish and value it, and as for day and night, cold and warmth, they cannot go against it. How much more the profound and obscure realm of the supreme Way, the realm of spontaneous transformation, generating Heaven and Earth, opening and closing yin and yang—one can only rest in and follow it. How could one resist and not comply?

They take having a lord as superior to themselves and still die for it—how much more that which is real?

**[Annotation]** The real is that which is not dependent on things but is spontaneous. The spontaneity that cannot be avoided—how could it be merely the command of a lord?

**[Subcommentary]** Superior means surpassing. The real refers to the aforementioned spontaneous transformation. People uniquely regard the lord and king as surpassing themselves in honor and nobility, and still lay down their lives without daring to avoid it. How much more the supreme mystery of the Way, the principle of spontaneity—could one desire not to follow and comply? To arrange and entrust to transformation is surely fitting.

A dried-up spring: fish together on dry land, moistening one another with dampness, wetting one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes.

**[Annotation]** Rather than insufficiency and mutual love, how much better is abundance and mutual freedom?

**[Subcommentary]** This begins the analogy. Rivers and lakes are vast and boundless; swimming freely, each is sufficient in deep water, no longer coming and going. They forget one another, and affection is severed.

When springs and sources run dry, perch and sturgeon suffer hardship, stranded together on land, tails thrashing and gills gasping in the sun. Then they spew foam to moisten one another, gasp to dampen one another—affection and care flow back and forth, each clinging ever closer. Compared to rivers and lakes, how far removed they are!

So too in the age of the Great Way, each thing roams freely, the cries of chickens and dogs heard but never crossing paths. Once the pure wind scatters, the turbid waves gradually rise; following principle and submitting to teaching, the nearness of sages begins. They take fastidious restraint as benevolence, clinging to rules as righteousness—fathers and sons, brothers, all harbor feelings and deceive one another. The sage feels shame at this, and rightly so.

Thus we know that fish, losing water, soak one another; people, losing the Way, grow attached in love. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, better to forget both and transform through the Way.

**[Annotation]** Praise and blame both arise from insufficiency. Thus the utterly sufficient forget good and evil, leave behind life and death, and merge with transformation—vast and unbound, nothing is not fitting. How could they know where Yao and Jie reside?

**[Subcommentary]** This completes the analogy. Tang Yao was a sagely ruler, Xia Jie a mediocre lord—so they praise Yao’s goodness and condemn Jie’s evil, tracing back to the delusion of Yao and Shun to exhort later generations. The rise of the seven virtues begins here. How much better to have no good, no evil, to forget both good and evil; to be neither right nor wrong, to cast off both right and wrong. Then one emerges into life and enters death, roaming with transformation; no going, no coming, treading the mysterious Way and attaining self-possession. How can this be spoken of in the same breath as clinging to sages and their teachings?

The great clod bears me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, rests me with death.

**[Annotation]** Form, life, old age, death—all are myself. Thus form bears me, life labors me, old age eases me, death rests me. Though these four change, they have never ceased to be me. Why should I cling to them?

**[Subcommentary]** The "great clod" is spontaneity. Form is the constructed thing, life the beginning of birth, old age the years of decline, death the day when qi scatters. Yet bearing form entails toil; life brings hardship. Old age, once powerless, offers brief respite; death’s extinction returns to stillness. Though these four change, they have never ceased to be me—so why should I be troubled?

Thus to treat my life as good is also to treat my death as good.

**[Annotation]** Life and death are both fate. Without goodness, that is all; with goodness, life is not alone in being good. If you deem my life good, then my death is also good.

**[Subcommentary]** Form, life, old age, death—all are myself. Thus to treat my life as good is to treat my death as good.

To hide a boat in a ravine, to conceal a mountain in a marsh—this seems secure. Yet in the dead of night, a strong man carries it away, and the deluded do not know.

**[Annotation]** To speak of the inescapability of life’s changes, one first presents the extreme of inescapability, then clarifies it with the tally of transformation—entrusting to change without attachment. Yet the power of the powerless is greatest in transformation. Thus it lifts heaven and earth to hasten toward the new, bears mountains and peaks to join the old. Without pause, in an instant it crosses into the new—so heaven and earth, the myriad things, never cease shifting. The world is ever renewed, yet people take it as old; boats daily change, yet they see them as before; mountains daily transform, yet they view them as the same. Now they clasp an arm and lose it—all has departed in darkness. Thus the self of before is no longer the self of now. My past and present both pass away—how could they ever cling to the old? Yet the world does not awaken, stubbornly believing what it meets can be bound and held. How deluded!

**[Subcommentary]** The dead of night, the darkness—this compares to the profound obscurity of the true principle. The "strong man" is creation. To hide a boat in the sea’s ravine is fitting; to conceal mountains in marshes is proper. Yet creation’s power bears them away, changing the old daily, swift as flowing water. The deluded, their minds dull, truly believe mountains and boats are secure, unmoving. How could they know that in darkness all shifts without cease? Yesterday’s self and today’s self are the same in this.

To hide the small and the great each in its proper place still allows for delay.

**[Annotation]** Not knowing to embody transformation, yet seeking to hide things so they do not change—though they reach the deepest, most secure places, each fitting its proper place, nothing can prevent their daily transformation. Thus those who hide and hold cannot stop their pursuit; those who do not hide and entrust to change cannot be changed by change.

**[Subcommentary]** *Dun* means transformation. Hiding a boat in a ravine, concealing a mountain in a marsh—this is hiding the great. Hiding a person in a room, concealing an object in a vessel—this is hiding the small. Though small and great differ, all hiding is fitting, yet thoughts still flow, the new ever replacing the old. Thus the Way of transformation cannot be escaped.

To hide the world within the world and find no place of delay—this is the great constant of things.

**[Annotation]** To hide nothing and entrust all is to merge with things without obstruction, to unite with change without division. Thus there is no outside, no inside, no death, no life—embodying heaven and earth, joining transformation. One seeks what pursues and cannot find it. This is the great constant, not the small intent of one corner.

**[Subcommentary]** *Dai* means constant. To hide the world within the world—how is this hiding? It is no hiding at all. Thus to unite life and death, merge with transformation, roam freely within the cosmos, riding creation in play—this is to hide the world within the world.

Having transformed what cannot be transformed, what pursuit remains? This is to embody the serene and quiescent in all beings, to penetrate the true essence of the great Dao—how could it be the delusion of the vulgar or the petty schemes of mortal wit?

Yet one who merely assumes human form still delights in it. As for human form, it is but one phase in the boundless transformations of the myriad things.

**[Annotation]** Human form is but one encounter among the myriad transformations—hardly cause for exclusive joy. Within the infinite, all encounters are like this; why should only human form bring delight while other forms offer no joy? Can the joy they bring be measured?

**[Annotation]** Originally not human, one transforms into human form—yet in this transformation, the former state is lost. To lose the former and delight in the present is to rejoice in what is encountered. Since transformations are endless, what is there one will not encounter? And if one delights in every encounter, how can joy have a limit?

**[Subcommentary]** *Te* means "only," *fan* means "to pass through." The great furnace of creation shapes all things, yet one who happens upon human form alone finds joy in it. But forms are as countless as their appearances; to delight in each encounter—how could such joy have an end? Thus, the forms and the joys they bring are beyond reckoning. Therefore, the sage wanders where things cannot be pursued and yet all abide.

**[Annotation]** The sage roams the paths of transformation, drifts upon the ceaseless flow of renewal. The myriad things and their myriad changes—he too undergoes myriad changes. Since transformations are boundless, he too is boundless. Who can pursue him? In life, he is as if gone; in death, he is as if present—then at what moment is he not present?

**[Subcommentary]** That things cannot be pursued is the work of nature—who can escape or chase what is natural? Thus, the sage sets his mind upon the paths of transformation, entrusts himself to the ever-renewing realm. Since he is never not himself, where does he not abide? To die well or to age well, to begin well or to end well—even ordinary people emulate this.

**[Annotation]** This is merely to balance within a hundred years, not to despise youth nor resent old age. Yet one who has not embodied transformation or equalized life and death still possesses a purity sufficient to serve as a teacher.

**[Annotation]** This is to merge with the myriad things and take transformation as one’s body. Thus, such a one becomes the standard for all under heaven—is this not fitting?

**[Subcommentary]** *Xi* means "to belong." Human understanding varies in brightness and obscurity. Within a single lifetime, some move through it with equanimity, finding joy or sorrow in the multitude of beings. As for longevity or early death, youth or age—they harbor no attachment. Though they have not forgotten life and death, they bear no aversion. Even so, they suffice as teachers for others to follow. How much more so one who merges with the myriad things, darkly uniting with transformation? Belonging to the perfected, relying on sagely wisdom, serving as the master of all things—is this not fitting?

The Dao has sentiment and trust, yet is without action and without form.

**[Annotation]** It has the sentiment of non-sentiment, thus it is without action; it has the trust of the constant and formless, thus it is without form.

**[Subcommentary]** Its clarity illuminates all equally—this is sentiment. It responds to stimuli like an echo—this is trust. Serene and still, without action; invisible when sought—without form.

It can be transmitted but not received;

**[Annotation]** The ancients transmitted it as a dwelling, yet none could receive and possess it.

It can be attained but not seen;

**[Annotation]** All may dwell within it, yet none perceive its form.

**[Subcommentary]** Through words, its principles may be transmitted, yet its essence cannot be grasped. Inwardly, one may awaken to it alone, yet it cannot be seen, for it is beyond form and color.

It is self-so, self-rooted. Before heaven and earth existed, it was already firmly established from ancient times.

**[Annotation]** This clarifies that nothing does not arise from being, and being arises from non-being.

**[Subcommentary]** *Zi* means "from," *cun* means "to exist." The Dao is empty and all-pervading, without beginning or end. From its root, before heaven and earth, before the five qi dispersed, the Dao of heaven already abided. Thus, the *Laozi* says: "There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth." It also says: "Look for its head, and it cannot be seen; follow its tail, and it cannot be seen."

It spiritizes ghosts and divinities, gives birth to heaven and earth.

**[Annotation]** How could non-being give rise to spirit? Yet without spiritizing ghosts and divinities, they spiritize themselves—this is the spirit of non-spirit. Without giving birth to heaven and earth, they give birth to themselves—this is the birth of non-birth. Thus, what is spirit is ultimately insufficient to be called spirit, but non-spirit is truly spirit. What achievement is there to claim? What deeds are there to rely upon?

**[Subcommentary]** The great Dao can spiritize ghosts and divinities, spiritize the Lord of Heaven, illuminate the three luminaries, and give rise to the two modes. The power of the utterly non-existent brings forth these functions. This is not spiritizing through spirit, nor giving birth through birth. Thus, the *Laozi* says: "Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; spirits attain the One and become numinous."

It is prior to the Supreme Ultimate yet not high; beneath the Six Directions yet not deep. Born before heaven and earth, it is not ancient; older than antiquity, it is not aged.

**[Annotation]** This speaks of the Dao’s omnipresence. Thus, in height, it is without height; in depth, it is without depth; in duration, it is without duration; in age, it is without age. It is present everywhere, yet wherever it is present, it is as if absent. Since above and below it reaches all, it cannot be called high or low. Since within and without it extends everywhere, it cannot be named inner or outer. Since it moves with transformation, it cannot be called enduring. Since it is without beginning or end, it cannot be called old.

**[Subcommentary]** The Supreme Ultimate refers to the five qi.

The Six Directions are the Six Extremes. Moreover, the Dao resides above the five qi yet is not lofty or remote; it dwells beneath the Six Directions yet is not profound or abstruse. Born before heaven and earth, it is not enduring; older than antiquity, it is not aged. This speaks of the Dao as neither high nor deep, neither lasting nor old—thus, the Dao is present everywhere, yet wherever it is present, it is as if absent.

The Lord of Xiwei attained it and thereby lifted heaven and earth.
**[Subcommentary]** The Lord of Xiwei was the title of a remote ancient sovereign before the invention of writing. Having grasped the numinous and penetrating Dao, he could govern all beings and uphold the Two Modes.

Another interpretation of *xiwei* is "to harmonize and unite," signifying his ability to blend the myriad things and accord with the Two Modes.

Fuxi attained it and thereby merged with the Mother of Qi.
**[Subcommentary]** Fuxi was one of the Three Sovereigns, so named for his ability to tame oxen and ride horses, nurturing sacrificial beasts. *Xi* means "to merge." The Mother of Qi is the primordial qi’s source, corresponding to the Dao. Having attained the supreme Dao, he could draw the Eight Trigrams, unfold the six lines, regulate yin and yang, and unite with the primordial qi.

The Dipper attained it and thus remains steadfast through all antiquity.
**[Subcommentary]** The Dipper is the Northern Dipper, the guiding cord of all stars, hence called the "Mainstay Dipper." *Wu* means "deviation." *Gu* means "beginning." Having attained the supreme Dao, it endures from beginning to end, sustaining heaven and earth without the slightest deviation.

The sun and moon attained it and thus shine without cease through all antiquity.
**[Subcommentary]** The sun and moon bear witness to the One Dao, hence their illumination from beginning to end remains unbroken.

Kanhuai attained it and thereby entered Kunlun.
**[Subcommentary]** Kunlun is a mountain name, located north of the Northern Sea. Kanhuai is the name of a spirit of Kunlun Mountain. *Xi* means "to enter." Kanhuai, with a human face and beast’s body, attained the Dao and entered Kunlun Mountain to become its spirit.

Feng Yi attained it and thereby roamed the great rivers.
**[Subcommentary]** Feng Yi, surnamed Feng and named Yi, was a native of Dishou Village in Tong Pass, Hongnong. Having ingested the Eight Minerals, he became a water immortal. The great river is the Yellow River. The Heavenly Thearch bestowed upon Feng Yi the title of River Earl, allowing him to wander the ford of Mengjin and the great rivers.

Jianwu attained it and thereby dwelled on Mount Tai.
**[Subcommentary]** Jianwu is the name of a spirit. Having attained the Dao, he became the spirit of the Eastern Marchmount, Mount Tai.

The Yellow Emperor attained it and thereby ascended to the cloudy heavens.
**[Subcommentary]** The Yellow Emperor was Xuanyuan. He mined copper from Mount Shou and cast a tripod at the foot of Mount Jing. When the tripod was completed, a dragon descended to the tripod to welcome the Emperor. The Emperor then led his ministers and the seventy-two women of his inner court, ascending by daylight upon clouds and riding the dragon to ascend to the heavens, where he transformed into an immortal and departed.

Zhuanxu attained it and thereby dwelled in the Dark Palace.
**[Subcommentary]** Zhuanxu was the grandson of the Yellow Emperor, also known as Emperor Gaoyang. At twelve, he donned the cap of adulthood; at fifteen, he assisted Shaohao; at twenty, he ascended the throne. He mined copper from Mount Yu to cast a tripod, enabling him to summon the spirits of the Four Seas, displaying numinous marvels. At ninety-seven, he passed away. Having attained the Dao, he became the Thearch of the North. *Xuan* is the color of the north, hence his dwelling in the Dark Palace.

Yuqiong attained it and stood at the Northern Culmen.
**[Subcommentary]** Yuqiong is the name of a water spirit, also called Yu Jing. With a human face and a crow’s body, he rides dragons in his travels. Though a descendant of Zhuanxu and the Yellow Emperor, having attained the Dao, he did not occupy the imperial throne but became a water spirit. As water corresponds to the north, his position is called the Northern Culmen.

The Queen Mother of the West attained it and sat upon Mount Shaoguang, her beginning unknown, her end unknown.
**[Subcommentary]** Shaoguang is the name of a mountain in the western extremity. The Queen Mother is the essence of the Great Yin, with a leopard’s tail and tiger’s teeth, delighting in laughter. During the reign of Shun, she sent envoys to present a jade ring; during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, she offered blue peaches. Though her appearance was that of a maiden of sixteen or seventeen, most comely, she constantly sat upon Mount Shaoguang in the west, beyond birth and death, hence her beginning and end are unknown.

Pengzu attained it and thus lived from the time of Youyu down to the Five Hegemons.
**[Subcommentary]** Pengzu was the great-great-grandson of Emperor Zhuanxu. Enfeoffed at Pengcheng, his Dao could be taken as ancestral, hence he was called Pengzu. Skilled in nurturing his nature, he was one who attained the Dao. The Five Hegemons were Kunwu as the Xia Hegemon, Dapeng and Shivei as the Yin Hegemons, and Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin as the Zhou Hegemons. Having attained the Dao, Pengzu enjoyed long life, living from the time of Youyu down to the Yin and Zhou dynasties, for a total of eight hundred years.

Fu Yue attained it and thereby assisted King Wuding, encompassing all under heaven, riding the Eastern Cord and mounting the Tail of the Winnowing Basket, ranking among the arrayed stars.
**[Annotation]** The Dao is without agency. This speaks of those who attain it through the Dao, merely to clarify their self-attainment. Self-attainment means the Dao cannot cause their attainment; my own non-attainment cannot be made attainment. Thus, all who attain it neither rely on the Dao externally nor depend on themselves internally—they suddenly attain it and transform alone. The difficulty of life is like this self-attainment and solitary transformation. Having attained life, why lament the failure to attain it and act upon it? Thus, acting for the sake of life is truly insufficient to preserve life, for life does not arise from oneself, and acting for it harms one’s true life.
**[Subcommentary]** Wuding was the name of a Yin king, also called High Ancestor. High Ancestor dreamed of Fu Yue and sent men to seek him throughout the world. He was found at the rammed-earth works of Fu Rock in Shan Prefecture’s Hebei County and was made minister to Wuding, bringing peace to our realm. Fu Yue was a stellar essence. One star of Fu Yue is located above the Tail of the Winnowing Basket. As the Tail of the Winnowing Basket is among the twenty-eight lodgings, sustaining the east, it is said he rides the Eastern Cord and mounts the Tail of the Winnowing Basket.

Thus, it stands in rank and file alongside the stars of Horn and Neck, hence the saying that it is "comparable to the arrayed stars."

*End of the Seventh Scroll of the Zhuangzi: Annotated Subcommentary*

*Eighth Scroll of the Zhuangzi: Annotated Subcommentary*
*Annotations by Guo Xiang of Henan*

The Venerable Master Cheng Xuanying of the Tang, *Subcommentary on the Southern Florescence Master*:

Nanbo Zikui asked Yu Ou, “Your years are advanced, yet your complexion is like that of a child—how is this so?” □

**[Subcommentary]** *Kui* should be an error for *Cha*, as this is the same Nanbo Zikui from the “Renwenshi” chapter. Yu Ou was a man of antiquity who embraced the Dao. *Ruzi* means “young child.” Having long heard the perfect Dao, Yu Ou was able to preserve and nurture life, so though his years were many, his countenance retained the glow of youth and the appearance of freshness. Since he differed from ordinary men, Zikui asked how he had attained this.

Yu Ou said, “I have heard the Dao.”

**[Annotation]** Having heard the Dao, one lets life follow its own course, and thus the qi and complexion remain whole.

**[Subcommentary]** He answered that by hearing the Dao, he had preserved his life, and so had reverted to youth and regained a child’s complexion.

Nanbo Zikui said, “Can the Dao #1 be learned?”

**[Subcommentary]** Seeing his appearance and complexion—so unlike those of ordinary men—his heart was filled with admiration, and so he inquired about the method of attaining it.

Yu Ou said, “No. How could it be?”

Yu Ou said, “You are not the right person.”

**[Subcommentary]** “No. How could it be?” means it cannot be learned. Your spirit is inwardly still, and your appearance outwardly radiant. Seeing your countenance #2, Zikui joyfully requested to learn. Deeming his question unworthy, I thus dismissed him as not the right person.

Now, Puliao Yi possessed the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage.

**[Subcommentary]** Puliao was of the Ji clan; Yi was his given name. An empty mind and serene tranquility constitute the Dao; keen intelligence and sharp discernment constitute talent. Puliao Yi had talent for external application but lacked the Dao of inner stillness, while you possess the Dao of emptiness and tranquility but lack keen talent. Each clings to one side, neither achieving perfect harmony. Yet when talent is weighed against the Dao, talent is inferior, and the Dao superior.

I wished to teach him, hoping he might indeed become a sage. Otherwise, imparting the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. Yet I still guarded it and instructed him.

**[Subcommentary]** *Shu* means to admire; *ji* means near; *guo* means next. Even the highest scholar, upon hearing the Dao, must still cultivate it diligently. Without diligent practice, the Dao cannot be attained. Thus, though one receives instruction, one must also study and practice, aspiring toward the profound Dao and next becoming a sage. Otherwise, teaching would be easy, but mastery requires steadfast cultivation—this is why attainment is difficult. You have long heard the supreme Dao and inwardly attained stillness; even now, when I wish to transmit it, I must still guard it. How much more so for a beginner—there is no room for laxity. Even if one hears it with the ears, what benefit is there? Thus, it is not knowing that is difficult, but practicing.

After three days, he was able to put the world outside himself.

**[Annotation]** *Wai* means to let go.

**[Subcommentary]** *Wai* means to forget. Teaching is not easy; transmitting the Dao is exceedingly difficult. As I prepared to instruct him, I concentrated my spirit and stilled my thoughts, cultivating and guarding it for three full days. Once the mind was empty and still, all myriad things appeared as void—thus, the world and all beneath it were seen as nothing. Having put the world outside himself, I then guarded it, and after seven days, he was able to put things outside himself.

**[Annotation]** Things are what one needs morning and night, intimately tied to oneself and difficult to forget.

**[Subcommentary]** The world and its myriad conditions are distant, so they are easy to forget; the things one relies on for life are close, so they are hard to relinquish. After guarding it for seven days, he was then able to let them go. Thus, Guo’s annotation says, “Things are what one needs morning and night, intimately tied to oneself and difficult to forget.”

Having put things outside himself, I then guarded it, and after nine days, he was able to put life outside himself.

**[Annotation]** To wholly let go.

**[Subcommentary]** Detaching from the body and forgetting the self, sitting in oblivion and losing the ego—after long practice, the depth of relinquishment gradually increased.

Having put life outside himself, he was then able to attain morning clarity.

**[Annotation]** Letting go of life means not fearing death; not fearing death, whatever one encounters is accepted. Suddenly unobstructed, one sees the mechanism and acts—this is morning clarity.

**[Subcommentary]** *Zhao* means dawn; *che* means brightness. Seeing life and death as one, forgetting both self and things, wisdom shines forth like the dawn breaking—thus, it is called morning clarity.

With morning clarity, he was then able to see the solitary.

**[Annotation]** Accepting whatever one encounters and forgetting all prior connections—this is seeing the solitary.

**[Subcommentary]** The supreme Dao is profoundly still, beyond words and forms, neither non-being nor being, neither past nor present. It comes and goes alone, without dependence or opposition. Beholding this sublime realm is called seeing the solitary. Thus, the scripture says, “Still and unchanging.”

Having seen the solitary, he was then able to be without past or present.

**[Annotation]** Moving together with the solitary.

**[Subcommentary]** Following the daily renewal of creation, moving together with transformation, not being swayed by external conditions—thus, there is no distinction between past and present.

Without past or present, he was then able to enter into neither death nor life.

**[Annotation]** Clinging to life leads to death; fearing death leads to life. Only without clinging or fear can one be without death or life.

**[Subcommentary]** Past and present are temporal distinctions; laws have the difference of life and death—these are the inverted views of the deluded. Since time is ever-renewing, there is no present or past; thus, the law neither departs nor arrives, neither dies nor lives. One who comprehends this principle is none other than you.

That which kills #4 life does not die; that which gives life does not live.

**[Subcommentary]** *Sha* means to extinguish; *si* also means to extinguish. This death was never extinguished; this life was never born. Neither dying #5 nor living, one enters into neither death nor life—thus, one embodies the law of neither birth nor extinction. Since the law is neither born nor extinguished, how could the emotions feel joy or aversion? Following it, there is nothing that does not accord.

As a thing, it does not fail to escort all,

**[Annotation]** Letting them escort themselves, thus nothing is not escorted.

**[Subcommentary]** *Jiang* means to send off. The Dao as a thing aids and saves without limit. Though it neither extinguishes nor lives, it also lives and extinguishes—thus, it welcomes endless life and sends off boundless death.

Nor does it fail to welcome all,

**[Annotation]** Letting them welcome themselves, thus nothing is not welcomed.

Nor does it fail to destroy all,

**[Annotation]** Letting them destroy themselves, thus nothing is not destroyed.

Nor does it fail to complete all.

**[Annotation]** Letting them complete themselves, thus nothing is not completed.

**[Subcommentary]** Without sending, it sends all to destruction; without welcoming, it welcomes all to completion.

Its name is called *yingning*.

**[Annotation]** One who merges with things moves with their entanglements yet is never not at peace.

**[Subcommentary]** *Ying* means disturbance; *ning* means stillness. The sage, in compassion, saves and aids all living beings. Though the wondrous root has no name, it takes on names according to things. Moving yet ever still, though disturbed, it remains at peace.

*Yingning* is that which is completed only after being disturbed.

**[Annotation]** If things are disturbed while one alone remains undisturbed, all will

Thus speaking, there is nothing that is not fate. You, Qin, understand the principle—do not deceive yourself with these words. Both were afflicted with hunchback, their spines protruding in five knotted humps, their jaws tucked into their navels, their shoulders rising above their crowns, their nape and growths pointing skyward. The qi of yin and yang had become disordered.

**[Annotation]** *Zhen*: chaotic, deranged.

Their backs bent so they could not look up; thus, their viscera pressed upward, their heads drooped so their jaws sank to their navels, their shoulder blades jutted above their necks, and their throats and crowns curled like great pendulous growths. The two qi of yin and yang, disordered and unregulated, caused their bodies to suffer such severe affliction. Yet their minds remained unperturbed, untroubled by it all.

**[Annotation]** Not taking it as suffering.

Though their bodies were twisted and contorted, their spirits remained at ease, undisturbed by the matter. They hobbled to the well and gazed into it, saying: "Alas! Will the Creator once more make me like this?"

**[Annotation]** Those who follow the natural transformations do not lament; only those bound to things do.

**[Annotation]** *Pingzong*: the dragging gait of the infirm.

Dragging themselves forward, they peered into the well and, seeing their own reflections, could not help but sigh in distress. Yet the great Dao is impartial, and the Creator treats all equally—why should I alone be singled out for such deformity? Their lament was but a means to illustrate the principle of things.

Zisi said: "Do you resent it?"

**[Annotation]** Their friendship was pure and unadorned, their hearts in harmony beyond the mundane. Seeing his sigh, Zisi was moved to ask in surprise.

He replied: "No, why should I resent it?"

**[Annotation]** *Wang*: nonexistent. Life and death, presence and absence—these are matters of no concern. Even if one laments, what is there to resent?

Suppose my left arm were gradually transformed into a rooster, and I used it to crow at dawn; suppose my right arm were gradually transformed into a crossbow, and I used it to hunt roasted crow; suppose my corpse were gradually transformed into a wheel, and my spirit into a horse—then I would ride it, no longer needing a chariot.

**[Annotation]** *Jin*: gradually. When the body undergoes transformation and change, there is nothing that cannot be followed, and nothing that cannot be followed is impossible.

**[Annotation]** If

**[Annotation]** Death and life are but waking and dreaming. In principle, one should dream undisturbed; one should not wish to be startled awake. When transformation leads to death, there is no cause for alarm.

**[Annotation]** *Chì*: a rebuke. Those who dwell beyond the mundane merge death and life into one, yet when a friend nears the end, they visit with harmonious light. Thus they rebuke the kin, bidding them stand aside, that the transformation may proceed without shock or distress.

Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to him: "How wondrous is the work of Creation! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it shape you into a mouse’s liver? Or into the arm of an insect?"

**[Annotation]** *Yòu*: again. *Xī*: what. *Shì*: to go. Leaning against the door, he watched the transformation unfold and addressed him: "Behold the great Craftsman—vast, impartial, unbound. One moment you are human, the next you return to change. Who can say where the Way beyond will lead you, or what form you will take? Perhaps your five viscera will become a mouse’s liver, or your four limbs the arm of an insect. Yet wherever transformation carries you, all is fitting."

Zilai replied: "To father and mother, a child must go east or west, north or south, only at their command. Yet the workings of yin and yang upon a person are even more compelling than father and mother.

**[Annotation]** From ancient times, some have defied the commands of their parents, but none have defied the changes of yin and yang or resisted the cycles of day and night.

**[Annotation]** The following is Zilai’s reply to Zili as he neared the end. A filial child obeys his parents without question—how much more so the workings of yin and yang, which surpass even one’s parents? Thus we know that while some in the world may defy their parents’ teachings, none have ever resisted the transformations of yin and yang. If death draws near and I refuse to heed it, then I am the one who resists. What fault lies with it?

**[Annotation]** Death and life are but day and night—nothing so distant. When the time for death comes, it cannot be forbidden. To harbor resistance is only to obstruct the natural order and hasten one’s end. The swiftness of death arises from my resistance, not from death itself. *Bǐ* refers to death; while alive, one regards death as other.

**[Annotation]** *Bǐ* refers to Creation. When Creation ordains that I draw near to death, if I abhor it and refuse to comply, then I am the one who resists yin and yang and defies transformation. The fault lies with me—what guilt is there in it? Guo’s annotation takes *bǐ* as death.

"The great Clod bears me in form, labors me in life, eases me in old age, and rests me in death. Thus to treat my life well is to treat my death well."

**[Annotation]** The principle is ever the same.

**[Annotation]** This repeats the earlier passage to confirm the preceding argument. The words are apt, hence their recurrence. The explanation of their meaning does not differ from the earlier intent.

Now, when the great smith smelts metal, if the metal leaps and bounds, crying, "I must become a *Mo Nuo*!"—the great smith will surely deem it an inauspicious metal. Likewise, when one merely assumes human form and exclaims, "A human! A human!"—the Creator will surely deem such a one an inauspicious person.

**[Annotation]** "A human! A human!"—this is but the wish to remain human.

It is like the metal’s leaping: the world knows such metal to be inauspicious, yet cannot allow it to transform of its own accord. The Dao of transformation meets with no obstacle; now that it has met with human form, was this done by design? Life is not made by design—it arises of itself in due time. To cling to it and claim possession—is this not delusion?

**[Annotation]** *Xiang* means "good." *Fan* means "to encounter." *Mo Nuo* is the name of an ancient fine sword. In former times, Gan Jiang, a smith of Wu, forged swords for the King of Wu. His wife was named Mo Ye, so he named the male sword *Gan Jiang* and the female sword *Mo Nuo*. When the great furnace smelts metal, it shapes vessels of every size. Yet if the metal in the crucible suddenly leaps and trembles, clamoring to become a fine sword, the smith will sigh in dismay, deeming it unfit. Likewise, when the great Creator carves all forms—birds, beasts, fish, insects—if one happens to become human and rejoices, clinging to this form and begging to remain human, the Creator will deem such a one a monstrous aberration. Now, if we take Heaven and Earth as the great furnace and the Creator as the great smith, where is there anything that cannot be?

**[Annotation]** All know that metal with attachments is inauspicious. Thus, if one recognizes that one is no different from metal, the attachments may be dissolved—and if dissolved, there is nothing that cannot be.

**[Annotation]** When the Two Modes and the Creator are taken as the furnace and smith, molding all things, shaping all beings, they act without intent, nurturing all equally. What they encounter is fitting—what is there to hate or love? In the unfolding of transformation, there is nowhere it cannot go.

Soundly asleep, suddenly awake.

**[Annotation]** Sleeping and waking remain as they are, without death or life burdening the heart.

**[Annotation]** *Cheng ran* describes a state of ease; *peng ran* describes a state of surprise. *Mei* means "to sleep," likened to death. *Jue* means "to wake," likened to life. Though sleep and waking differ, are they not both marked by ease and joy? Though death and life are distinct, are they not both subject to fate and free wandering? This concludes the passage on Zi Lai’s comparison of death and life to sleep and waking.

Zi Sanghu, Mengzi Fan, and Zi Qinzhang were friends. They said to one another: "Who can join together in non-joining, act together in non-acting?"

**[Annotation]** Those who embody Heaven and Earth and merge with transformation—though their limbs perform different tasks and their five organs have distinct functions—never join together, yet all their parts harmonize. This is joining together in non-joining. They never act for one another, yet inner and outer are both fulfilled. This is acting together in non-acting. If one were to strain heart and will to care for the limbs, or move thighs and arms to manage the organs, the more one managed, the more inner and outer would be exhausted. Thus, those who take the world as one body have no partial love within it.

**[Annotation]** These three were all recluses beyond the world, obscure in transformation, one in death and life. Their aspirations and conduct aligned, so they befriended one another. Each fulfilled their role, asking: "Who can be friends in the spontaneity of the void?" This is to join without joining, to act without acting—non-acting that acts, non-joining that joins. It is like the five organs, six senses, four limbs, and hundred parts, each with its own function, mutually serving without intent. Is there a heart that joins, or feelings that bind to closeness or distance? Though there is no intent to act for one another, the work of mutual fulfillment is accomplished. Thus, to join in non-joining and befriend in non-acting—does this not embody the same principle?

Who can ascend to Heaven and wander in the mists, twisting and turning without end?

**[Annotation]** Nothing is not entrusted to them.

**[Annotation]** *Nao tiao* means "to meander." To ascend to Heaven is to show lofty lightness; to roam in the clouds and mists is to show no attachment to being. Thus, one can follow transformation without limit, meandering with the Creator.

Forgetting life, with no end in sight?

**[Annotation]** To forget life is to forget all, so one can follow transformation and entrust it all, with no end in sight.

**[Annotation]** *Zhong qiong* means "death." To join in forgetting life and to extend this to death—merging death and life—is to follow transformation without end.

The three looked at one another and laughed, their hearts in accord, and so became friends.

**[Annotation]** If this is called friendship, it is but a lodging for the clarity of utmost kinship, without the nearness of loving attachment.

**[Annotation]** Words forgotten in the realization of meaning, they looked and laughed. Minds merged with the realm, their hearts were in accord. Aligned in the Dao beyond the world, they became friends.

By and by, someone informed them that Zi Sanghu had died, and he had not yet been buried. Confucius heard of this and sent Zigong to assist with the arrangements.

The three looked at one another in silence, words utterly stilled. In but a moment, Zi Duohu died. When Confucius heard of this, he sent Zigong to offer condolences and instructed him to provide for the funeral, arranging all matters to receive the guests. This was to reveal the distinction between those within the world and those beyond it, and so he entrusted this task to the Master and Qin Zhang.

They wove mats or played the zither, singing in harmony together—
**[Annotation]** *Qu* means "thin" or "sparse." Some wove thin bamboo mats, others played the zither and sang, harmonizing in joy, their faces free of sorrow. This is what is meant by "forgetting one another in life," the ultimate of those beyond the world.

They sang:
*"Alas, Zi Sanghu!
Alas, Zi Sanghu!
You have returned to your true nature,
While I remain here, still a man of the world."*

**[Annotation]** To weep when others weep is but the border of the worldly. To equalize life and death, to forget grief and joy, and to sing before the corpse—this is the ultimate of those beyond the world.

**[Annotation]** *"Jie lai"* is the sound of the song. *"Zi Sanghu"* and what follows are the words of their harmony. *"Cai"* is the sound of their response. For from non-being comes being—this is called life; from being returns non-being—this is called death.

Now that you have returned to emptiness and quiescence, you have reverted to your root and returned to your true nature, while I still lodge in the realm of men, a sojourner yet to return to my native land. We sing in equalizing life and death, and thus arise these harmonies.

Zigong hastened forward and asked, "Dare I ask—is it proper to sing before the corpse?"

**[Annotation]** The rites of the mundane world value restraint and decorum. Even neighbors in mourning do not pound grain for one another. How much less should one face the corpse of a friend without grief or weeping, playing the zither and singing as if nothing were amiss? Is this not a breach of ritual? Zigong, astonished by their conduct, hurried forward to question them.

The two looked at each other and laughed, saying, "How could he know the meaning of ritual?"

**[Annotation]** One who understands the meaning of ritual roams beyond to order what is within, guards the mother to preserve the child, and follows the promptings of the heart without deviation. If one is bound by reputation and constrained by form, then filial piety cannot be sincere, compassion cannot be genuine, and fathers and sons, brothers and kin, will harbor feelings and deceive one another. How could this be the great meaning of ritual?

**[Annotation]** The great ritual moves in harmony with Heaven and Earth, unbound by form or name. It attains its end by following truth, proceeding as the heart dictates. How much more so when one profoundly unites life and death—how could grief or joy remain in the breast? Yet Zigong is a Confucian scholar of the mundane world, his nature still partial and rigid, valuing only superficial refinement, not yet attuned to the subtle root. How could such a one fathom the depth of ritual? It is only fitting that those beyond the world should mock him.

Zigong returned and reported to Confucius, saying, "What manner of men are they? They cultivate no conduct, yet disregard their physical forms. They sing before the corpse, their countenances unchanged. I have no words to describe them. What manner of men are they?"

**[Annotation]** *Ming* means "name." Zigong returned and told the Master: "Those two are difficult to fathom. They cultivate no virtue or conduct, yet forget their physical forms, merging life and death. They sing and rejoice before the dead, their spirit and form unchanged. Since their Way cannot be grasped, it is hard to name them."

Confucius said, "They roam beyond the bounds; I roam within them."

**[Annotation]** Principle has its ultimate limit, and what is within and beyond interpenetrate. There has never been one who attained the utmost in roaming beyond yet did not interpenetrate with what is within, nor one who interpenetrated with what is within yet did not roam beyond. Thus the sage constantly roams beyond to broaden what is within, responds without intention to what is, and though he moves his form all day, his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Though he attends to the myriad affairs, he remains serene and at ease. To see the form but not the spirit—this is the common affliction of the world. Thus, when one sees him moving among things, none can say he has left things behind and departed from men. When one observes him transforming in response to affairs, none can say he sits in forgetfulness and attains self-mastery. How could this apply only to the sage? It is rather that the utmost principle has no such distinctions. Therefore, Zhuangzi, in clarifying the lineage to which the tradition belongs to awaken the world, does not directly attribute this to Confucius. Otherwise, some might rely on their own views to reject it. Thus he transcends the sage’s inner realm and entrusts the teaching to those beyond the bounds. One should forget the vehicle of this entrustment to seek the great meaning of the work’s composition. Then the Way of roaming beyond to broaden what is within will be clearly evident, and the *Zhuangzi* will indeed be seen as a discourse that traverses the vulgar and surpasses the world.

**[Annotation]** *Fang* means "realm." Those two equalize life and death, unbound by the constraints of teaching and conduct, and thus roam their hearts beyond the cosmos. Yet Confucius and Zigong are great Confucians of their age, practicing the rites of mourning and observing the decorum of ritual, their minds fixed on grief and joy, their hearts bound within the realm. This is why they differ.

What is within and beyond do not reach one another, yet I sent you to offer condolences—how shallow I am!

**[Annotation]** Offering condolences is a minor affair of the mundane world; to apply it to those beyond is shallow indeed.

**[Annotation]** The profound and the Confucian are separated by principle, their Ways distinct. Judged by superiority and inferiority, they do not reach one another. To use the vulgar rites of the mundane realm to offer condolences to those beyond is like reusing a straw dog—how utterly base! They, however, join with the Creator as companions and roam in the single qi of Heaven and Earth.

**[Annotation]** All is merged, thus there is no duality.

**[Annotation]** They comprehend the transformations of yin and yang and join with the Creator as companions. They embody the unity of the myriad things and roam in the single qi of the two poles.

They regard life as an excrescence or dangling tumor,

**[Annotation]** Like a tumor that hangs of itself, an excrescence that attaches of itself—this is the accidental fruition of qi, not what they delight in.

and death as the bursting of a tumor or the draining of an abscess,

**[Annotation]** Like a tumor that bursts of itself, an abscess that drains of itself—this is the natural dispersal of qi, not what they regret.

**[Annotation]** These three are men who embody the Dao, who comprehend life and death and merge with transformation. Thus, when qi gathers and life arises, it is like an excrescence or tumor attaching and hanging—nothing they delight in. When qi scatters and death comes, it is like a tumor bursting or an abscess draining—nothing they regret.

If this is so, how could they know where life and death, superiority and inferiority, lie?

**[Annotation]** Life and death alternate without end. Moving with them, there is nowhere one cannot go, and thus one does not know where victory or defeat lies.

**[Annotation]** *Xian* means "superior," *hou* means "inferior." An excrescence, a tumor, an abscess—these four are all ailments, yet qi gathers and scatters, and the illness has no victory or defeat. If one compares this to life and death, how can one know where superiority or inferiority lie?

They borrow from other things and entrust themselves to the same body.

**[Annotation]** *Jia* means "to rely on." Now life and death, gathering and scattering, change without pattern—all are other things. There is nothing other that is not relied upon, and thus what is relied upon, though other, together forms a single body.

The elements—water, fire, metal, wood—though disparate things, borrow from one another; the myriad forms lodge together, jointly composing a single body. Thus we know the physical form has always been empty and false. Forget the liver and gallbladder; abandon the ears and eyes.

**[Annotation]** Entrust them to principle and proceed in darkness.

**[Annotation]** Once one knows the bodily form is hollow and false, nothing remains to delight or cling to. Thus inwardly one forgets the organs and viscera, outwardly forgets the sense-gates.

Revolving through beginning and end, one knows not where the thread begins or the boundary lies.

**[Annotation]** When even the five viscera are forgotten, what thing remains to be recognized? Never having possessed discernment, one may release the self upon the path of transformation, darkly merging with the waves of reversal, never knowing where beginning or end reaches its limit.

**[Annotation]** *Duan* means "thread," *ni* means "boundary." *Fanfu* means "coming and going"; *zhongshi* means "life and death." Having forgotten the bodily form and dismissed the faculties, one may go and come with life and death, moving together with transformation. Since transformation has no limit, none can know its thread or boundary.

Vague and wandering beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action.

**[Annotation]** The so-called work of non-action is not mere folded-hands silence; the so-called beyond the dust and grime is not hiding in the mountains and forests.

**[Annotation]** *Mangran* describes the appearance of unknowing. *Panghuang* and *xiaoyao* are both names for self-possessed ease. Dust and grime are the things of effort—forms, sounds, and the like. Having already relinquished the bodily frame, one here further forgets the mind’s cunning, thus roaming beyond the dust’s burdens, at ease in the realm of clarity and emptiness, making non-action one’s enterprise. How could such a one fret over the rites of the vulgar world to display before the eyes and ears of the crowd?

**[Annotation]** What they display before the crowd are merely the dust and grime, not the dark things beyond form.

**[Annotation]** *Fenfen* means "disturbed." These several persons, pure and lofty, empty and serene, arrange nothing against transformation, following nature and entrusting themselves to truth. How could they force themselves to observe ritual refinements and be bound by the rites of the vulgar world?

The display of solemn demeanor delights the eyes and ears of the crowd. Zigong said: "In that case, what path does the Master follow?"

**[Annotation]** Zigong had not heard of *xing* and the Dao of Heaven, so he saw what the Master followed but not *how* he followed it.

What he followed was no following—how could the world perceive this?

**[Annotation]** Within the realm and beyond it, depths differ; he did not know which Way the Master adhered to. The exchange between teacher and disciple gave rise to this doubt.

The Master said: "Qiu is one punished by Heaven."

**[Annotation]** Within the realm, one is like the cassia or the tangerine—what is prized lies beyond it. Those who roam beyond depend on what is within; those who depart from others conform to the vulgar. Thus, one who possesses the world does not take the world as his heart’s concern. Only after relinquishing things can one enter the multitude; only after sitting in forgetfulness can one respond to affairs. The more one relinquishes, the more one attains. If one abides in this ultimate state, though one may wish to cast it aside, principle will naturally come—this is what neither Heaven nor man can pardon.

**[Annotation]** The sage’s exposition of ritual and propriety is like the cassia or tangerine in form and nature. Since Confucius adhered to what lies within the realm, he was by principle one punished by Heaven. Thus, the *Dechong* chapter says, "How can one escape Heaven’s punishment?" Nevertheless, I share this with you.

**[Annotation]** Though he was utterly condemned by the world, he simply shared it with you—showing that he himself dwelt beyond.

**[Annotation]** Confucius, the sage, blended his light to engage with things, riding the waves in harmony with the world, prizing these vulgar rites. Though he descended to expound what lies within the realm and shared it with you, his mind roamed beyond it, detached and unconfined.

Zigong said: "May I ask about this path?"

**[Annotation]** He asked about the meaning of roaming beyond while sharing what lies within.

**[Annotation]** *Fang* means "Way." He asked: though he expounded within the mixed realm, his mind roamed beyond it—how did the inner and outer mysteriously unite?

Confucius said: "Fish come together in water; men come together in the Dao."

**[Annotation]** *Zao* means "to go to." What fish go to is nothing more fitting to their nature than deep water; what men reach is nothing more fulfilling than the defense of the Dao. Though their emotions and wisdom differ, all alike do so. This briefly sets forth the principle; the explanation follows below.

Those who come together in water dig ponds to secure their sustenance; those who come together in the Dao attain stability without effort.

**[Annotation]** Though what they come to differs, all alike, by doing nothing, achieve their ends—from beyond the realm they share what lies within. Only thus do they secure sustenance and settle into mastery. None fail to do so; they simply remain unaware, and so perfect non-action.

**[Annotation]** This explains the preceding principle. The great rivers, lakes, and seas are all called "heavenly ponds." Fish in the vast waters dwell in mud and sand, drawing from them their nourishment and supply. So too do men abide in the great Dao, nurturing their nature through clarity and emptiness, at ease without affairs, and thus attain the stillness and peace of their inherent nature. Hence it is said: fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; men forget one another in the defense of the Dao.

**[Annotation]** When each is self-sufficient, they forget one another—none in the world is otherwise. The perfected man is ever sufficient, and so ever forgetful.

**[Annotation]** This further explains the preceding principle. In deep waters, fish swim freely, each sufficient and forgetful of the other. Within the defense of the Dao, inner fullness severs partial attachments—how can this be compared to those who chase after the dregs of benevolence and righteousness? Thus the meaning of singing before the corpse.

Zigong said: "May I ask about the *jiren*?"

**[Annotation]** He asked: where are those who, as mentioned before, roam beyond the realm and do not pair with the common?

**[Annotation]** *Ji* means "unpaired." Those who cultivate non-action, distancing themselves from the body and estranged from human relations, do not pair with the common. May I ask about such a one—what is his Way?

Confucius said: "The *jiren* is unpaired among men but companioned by Heaven."

**[Annotation]** Those who inwardly merge with the mysterious roam outwardly. Only one who alone can roam outwardly while merging inwardly, letting the myriad things follow their nature, allowing each Heavenly nature to be fulfilled and the Dao of emperors and kings to be realized—such a one is unpaired among men but companioned by Heaven.

**[Annotation]** From here onward, Confucius answers Zigong. *Companioned* means "equal" or "the same." One who does not cultivate benevolence and righteousness, does not pair with things, but follows his original nature—such a one is the same as the principle of spontaneity. Hence it is said: what is a petty man in Heaven is a noble man among men; what is a noble man among men is a petty man in Heaven.

**[Annotation]** In terms of spontaneity, there are no petty or noble men. In terms of human principles, one companioned by Heaven may be called a noble man.

**[Annotation]** One who embraces transformation and practices righteousness is a noble man; one who deviates from the Dao and violates virtue is a petty man. Thus, those who enact rigid benevolence and employ ostentatious righteousness are called noble men by human standards but petty men by the standards of Heaven. Hence we know that Zifan and Qinzhang, unpaired with the common, are called *jiren*—truly noble men of Heaven. The repetition emphasizes the meaning.

Yan Hui asked Zhongni: "Mengsun Cai, when his mother died, wept without tears, felt no grief in his heart, and did not mourn with sorrow. Lacking these three, he was praised for his mourning.

**[Annotation]** Mengsun Cai was a worthy man of Lu. Embracing the Dao of non-action, he understood that life and death are not two, and so could advance within the realm while his mind roamed beyond it. Though he observed the rites for his mother’s mourning without flaw, his demeanor was composed and refined, full of filial grace—yet his tears did not flow, his heart felt no grief, and his voice held no sorrow. Lacking these three, he was not called a filial son, yet within his village and state, all praised him, saying his mourning was deeply in accord with ritual propriety. Was there indeed one in Lu who gained the name without the reality?"

Yan Hui found this strange.

**[Annotation]** The people of Lu observed his rites, but Yan Hui examined his heart. It was merely an introductory phrase. Wailing and wearing sackcloth were the common customs within the realm; a heart without grief aligned with the forgetfulness beyond it. The people of Lu saw only his outward display, thus granting him the reputation of mourning well; Yan Hui, perceiving his inner heart, knew there was no true filial substance. Therefore, upon seeing Mengsun Cai, he immediately felt doubt and wonder.

Confucius said: "That Mengsun clan has exhausted it—surpassed even knowledge."

**[Annotation]** One who exhausts the principle of life and death, responding to both inner and outer with fitting action, moves in accord with Heaven’s course—none can match such knowledge.

**[Annotation]** *Surpassed* means gone beyond. The Mengsun clan had plumbed the root of joy and sorrow, hence neither joy nor sorrow; they had fathomed the source of life and death, hence forgetting both life and death. Having traced the origin, they could harmonize inner and outer; responding to things without intent, how could this be the proper use of knowledge? Only when one seeks to distinguish and finds no difference—

**[Annotation]** Seeking to distinguish life and death yet finding no difference between them, like the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter proceeding in their course.

**[Annotation]** Life comes and death departs, like the four seasons—thus Mengsun sought to distinguish but found no difference. Yet he had already made distinctions. The Mengsun clan knew not how they lived, knew not how they died;

**[Annotation]** Having sought distinction yet found none, there was nothing they did not accept. Accepting all, they did not dwell on life and death but entrusted them to natural transformation.

**[Annotation]** Though they had sought to distinguish, they ultimately knew no difference between life and death, thus they could rest in change without allowing joy or sorrow to disturb their hearts. They knew not to cling to what came before, knew not to cling to what came after;

**[Annotation]** They accepted whatever they encountered. Like things transformed—

**[Annotation]** They did not resist transformation.

**[Annotation]** *What came before* refers to life; *what came after*, to death. *Like* means to follow. Having unified life and death, they neither departed nor clung; having merged with transformation, they followed it as things changed. —awaiting the transformations they did not yet know. Had they not already done so?

**[Annotation]** Life and death turn and flow as one with transformation, so that they even forgot what they knew in the present—how could they await what they did not yet know and preemptively grieve?

**[Annotation]** *Transformations they did not yet know* refers to future, unmanifest changes. *Already* means to cease. Even present life is forgotten—how much more the transformations to come? If one were to use the mind to anticipate, it would be better to cease and do nothing. For just as one is about to transform, how can one know it will not transform? Just as one is about to remain untransformed, how can one know it has not already transformed?

**[Annotation]** Having transformed and come to life, how can one know the time before birth? Being in the midst of transformation and facing death, how can one know what comes after death? Thus there is nothing to avoid or cling to, and one goes along with transformation.

**[Annotation]** Just now, in the midst of transforming into a person, how can one know what came before this untransformed state? Just now, alive one day and untransformed the next, how can one know what comes after death? One should simply follow reason and proceed, going along with transformation, without the labor of grieving death while alive or vainly rejoicing or lamenting. "It is only you and I who remain dreaming, never yet awakened.

**[Annotation]** Life and death are but waking and dreaming. Now, if one dreams and takes it for waking, there is no way to prove that waking is not dreaming; if there is no way to prove that waking is not dreaming, then there is also no way to prove that life is not death. Life and death, waking and dreaming—one knows not where they lie. In whatever one encounters, there is nothing that is not self-possessed. Why grieve over this while worrying about that?

**[Annotation]** Dreaming occurs in the stupor of sleep; waking is the clarity of day. Confucius and Yan Hui were still bound by names and teachings, benighted within the realm of waking and dreaming, not yet awakened to life and death. Moreover, he experienced bodily shock without harm to the heart,

**[Annotation]** He took transformation as mere bodily disturbance, thus life and death did not harm or burden his heart.

**[Annotation]** That Mengsun, merged with transformation, saw life and death as mere startling changes to the body, yet ultimately felt no joy or sorrow to burden his spirit. —having a new dwelling each day without the emotion of death.

**[Annotation]** He took the body’s changes as daily renewal of his dwelling, his nature not regarding it as death.

**[Annotation]** *Each day* means daily renewal. *Dwelling* is the abode of the spirit. Because of the body’s changes, he saw his abode as renewed each day, his tranquil spirit undisturbed, ultimately without distinction between life and death. The Mengsun clan alone was awakened; when others wept, he wept too—this was simply what was fitting for him.

**[Annotation]** The perpetually awakened encounter nothing contrary, thus when others wept, he wept too—this was precisely what was fitting for him.

**[Annotation]** Mengsun, unified with life and death, dwelled alone in awakening, responding to inner and outer without transgressing human principles. When others wept, he wept too—this was simply following what was fitting for things. Moreover, all this is "us" to me.

**[Annotation]** Life and death, transformation—all are "us." Since all is "us," what have I lost? Having lost nothing, what cause for sorrow? Without resistance, when others wept, he wept too; without sorrow, though he wept, he was not grieved.

**[Annotation]** Life and death, all is "us"—nothing is not "us," so what have I lost? If one takes attachment to "us" as intent, then what is not "us"? How indeed could one know what I mean by "us"?

**[Annotation]** There is nothing that is not "us," thus inner and outer are mystically one, pervading past and present, daily renewed with transformation—how could one know where "us" resides?

Should myriad transformations unfold, yet I remain constant—whether new self or old self, what cause for joy or aversion? Moreover, you dream of becoming a raven and soaring to the heavens, or of turning into a fish and plunging into the abyss.

**[Annotation]** This speaks of finding fulfillment in every circumstance.

How can one know whether the speaker now is awake or still dreaming?

**[Annotation]** In dreams, one believes oneself awake—how then can we be certain that the present is not a dream, or that it is not wakefulness? Since the shifts between waking and dreaming are without limit, the changes of life and death are nothing to cling to.

**[Annotation]** 厉 means "to reach." Whether as fish or raven, one follows nature and wanders freely, at ease in life or death. Since fish and raven hold no hierarchy, why rank life and death or cling to either? Mengsun mastered this source, thus never troubled his mind.

Moreover, how can we know whether this discourse on fish and raven occurs in waking clarity or in the midst of a dream? In dreams, one takes oneself for awake—how can today’s wakefulness be distinguished from dreaming? Thus, waking, dreaming, life, and death cannot be fixed.

What one attains brings no occasion for laughter; laughter offered brings no occasion for rejection.

**[Annotation]** When all one attains is fitting, one forgets the fitting—thus no cause for laughter. *Pai* means "to shift." Mourning rites and sorrowful wailing, joyful laughter and celebration—when grief or joy linger in the heart, one cannot move with what is fitting. But Mengsun was ever at ease, so though he wept, he felt no sorrow, flowing with transformation.

**[Annotation]** 造 means "to arrive"; 献 means "to offer."

"To *pai* means to shift with change. When all one encounters is fitting, this too is fitting—how could one need joyful laughter to then find delight? If one waits for good fortune to move one before finding fittingness, this is to be unable to follow transformation and shift with things. Now Mengsun was ever fitting, thus though he wept, he felt no sorrow. Abiding in shifting, he departed with transformation, thereby entering the vast oneness of heaven.

**[Annotation]** Abiding in shifting and departing with transformation, one thus enters the silence and vastness, becoming one with heaven.

From this point up to Zisi, their attainment was the same. The mourning they observed differed, hence their songs and wailing were not alike.

**[Annotation]** Wherever one is, all is fitting, thus one abides in shifting with change, never departing from oneself, and departing with transformation. Such a person can enter the wondrous gate of vast emptiness and the singular Dao of spontaneity.

Yier visited Xu You. Xu You said: 'How did Yao aid you?'

**[Annotation]** *Zi* means to supply or assist.

**[Annotation]** Yier was a worthy of antiquity. *Zi* means to supply or assist. Yier first paid homage to Emperor Yao, then met Zhongwu. He was asked: 'Emperor Yao is a great sage, his virtue and power most lofty. Since you have paid him homage, what teachings or aid did he provide? Pray, recount them.'

Yier said: 'Yao told me, "You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness, and clearly speak of right and wrong."'

**[Annotation]** *Gong* means "personally." Benevolence is the nurturing kindness toward things; righteousness is the cutting away of wrong. Right means to clearly reward the good; wrong means to clearly punish the evil. These four are what human relations esteem. You must personally enact them and also clearly speak of them to instruct others.' These words show Yier’s confusion at Yao’s teachings.

Xu You said: 'Then why have you come to court?'"

**[Annotation]** *Er* means "you." *Xi* means "why." *Wei* is a particle."

Yao seeks to instruct you further in the harms of punishments—your wounds are already grievous; why come again? Now that Yao has branded you with benevolence and righteousness and mutilated you with right and wrong, how will you wander the path of boundless freedom, unbridled spontaneity, and ceaseless transformation?

**[Annotation]** This means he will mar himself with the teachings of form, unable to roam again the realm of self-attainment or the unbound Way.

**[Commentary]** *Jing* means "to chisel the forehead." *Yi* means "to cut off the nose." *Zisui* means "unrestrained." *Zhuanxi* means "to change." *Tu* means "Way." Benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong injure the true nature, their harm akin to mutilation by punishment. Now that you have been branded and mutilated by Yao, your nature and feelings constrained, how can you again roam in self-attainment, wander in carefree ease, or move with unhurried freedom along the Way of transformation? This means you can no longer do so.

Yier said: "Even so, I wish to wander its outskirts."

**[Annotation]** Not daring to tread the central Way again, I would be content to wander its borders.

**[Commentary]** Though I suffer this mutilation, my hope remains unabated. No longer daring to walk the heart of the Way, I wish only to tread its outer edges.

Xu You said: "It cannot be. The blind have no part in the beauty of brows, eyes, and countenance; the sightless have no share in the sight of blue and yellow, of *ling* and *bi*."

**[Commentary]** The blind have eyes yet see no things; the sightless have eyes like drumskin, sealed and unseeing. Such people, their eyes already ruined, cannot behold the colors of blue and yellow, nor delight in the beauty of brows, eyes, and countenance. This is like Yier, who, having suffered Yao’s branding and mutilation, has had his nature and wisdom wounded—how can he then cherish the profound and mysterious or behold the manifold wonders?

Yier said: "Though Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength, and the Yellow Emperor lost his wisdom, all occurred within the forging of the furnace."

**[Annotation]** This means that not all things in the world are self-complete; the principle of spontaneity sometimes requires smelting and forging to become vessels. Thus, these three, too, having heard the Dao, afterward lost what they had pursued.

This is all figurative speech, to dispel the burden of *yunwei*."

**[Subcommentary]**
Wu Zhuang was a beauty of antiquity who, upon hearing the Dao, no longer adorned herself and thus forgot her own loveliness. Ju Liang was a man of great strength in ancient times who, upon hearing the Dao and embracing femininity, no longer boasted of his power. The Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan, possessed sagely wisdom, yet upon hearing the Dao, he too was able to relinquish and forsake his knowledge. The *lu* is the furnace; the *chui*, the hammer. These three individuals, having heard the Dao, afterward forgot what they had pursued to accord with their true nature—just as worldly vessels rely on smelting and forging to fulfill their use. Why then should the principle of spontaneity be hindered? Now that you, Master, instruct and enlighten me to perfect my Way, is this not so?

Thus we know that the spontaneous creation of things lies within the workings of the furnace and hammer, which is to say, there is meaning in cultivation, refinement, and forging. How do we know that the Creator does not cease my branding and repair my mutilation, allowing me to mount the completed Way and follow you, Master?

**[Annotation]**
That which proceeds directly and without restraint is spontaneity; yet when such proceeding wounds one’s nature, and one is able to change upon wounding—this too is spontaneity. How do we know that my spontaneity will not cease the branding and repair the mutilation, allowing me to mount the completable Way and follow you, Master? To abandon me and refuse instruction would seem contrary to the utmost of the Creator.

**[Subcommentary]**
The Creator is akin to the transforming power of creation. Though I have suffered the maiming of benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong upon my nature, how do we know that within the workings of creation, it will not repair my mutilation and cease my branding, enabling me to reform and renew, mount the completable Way, and follow you, Master, to seek further benefit? To cast me aside and withhold teaching would seem to defy the Creator.

Xu You said: "Alas! It cannot be known."

I shall speak to you of its general outline.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Alas*—this is an exclamation. The supreme Dao is profoundly mysterious, transcending speech and form, ungraspable by the mind’s reckoning. Thus, he feigned ignorance, saying, “It cannot be known.” Yet since your plea for instruction is so earnest, I cannot remain silent. Though its depths cannot be fully expressed in words, I shall sketch its essentials for you.

O my Master! O my Master! You order the myriad things yet claim no righteousness; your blessings extend through ten thousand generations yet claim no benevolence.

**[Annotation]**
All is thus of itself—there is no deliberate act of love in its midst. Where, then, would benevolence and righteousness reside?

**[Subcommentary]**
“O my Master” refers to the supreme Dao. Though it cannot be grasped by the mind, I shall briefly convey its essence: it is my Master. *Sheng* means “to shatter.” Consider the autumn frost descending—it withers the myriad things, yet does it act with intent to sever or judge? The balmy breath of spring nurtures all life, yet does it act with deliberate affection to be called benevolent? It is simply thus, not otherwise. Since Xu You takes the supreme Dao as his teacher, and the Dao is as I have described, how can you cling to benevolence and righteousness? This is but a rough outline of the method to cease branding and repair mutilation.

You are older than high antiquity yet do not grow old.

**[Annotation]**
It is ever-renewing.

You embrace heaven and earth, carve and shape all forms, yet claim no artistry.

**[Annotation]**
It is natural, thus not artful.

**[Subcommentary]**
Before the myriad forms existed, this Dao was already present, complete in wisdom and power. Thus, it is metaphorically called “elder,” though in truth it has no age. If it is not “elder,” how could it grow old? To clarify that it is not “elder” yet is elder, not old yet is old, it is said: *older than high antiquity yet does not grow old.* Though heaven covers and earth bears, the Dao is their source. All forms are carved and shaped, yet they all draw from the transformative power of creation, sharing in spontaneity. Thus, the name of artistry vanishes. Since it is neither old nor artful, neither right nor wrong, what can you possibly articulate? This is the realm in which it moves.

**[Annotation]**
It wanders in non-action and takes as teacher that which has no teacher.

**[Subcommentary]**
The realm in which my Master’s mind roams is expressed in these words alone. This summarizes the preceding meaning of “my Master.”

Yan Hui said: I have gained.

**[Annotation]**
To diminish is to gain.

**[Subcommentary]**
Yan Hui, having received the teachings of Confucius and held them fast in his heart while seeking the Dao, felt his understanding advance and presented his realization to his teacher. To diminish the full is to gain emptiness, thus diminishing is gaining.

Zhongni said: What do you mean?

**[Subcommentary]**
Since you say you have gained, what is your meaning?

He said: I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness.

**[Subcommentary]**
I have forgotten the benevolence of universal love and the righteousness of judging right and wrong. This is what I mean by gaining.

He said: Good, but not yet sufficient.

**[Annotation]**
Benevolence is the expression of universal love; righteousness is the function of perfecting things. Love is not benevolence—benevolence is merely its outward conduct. Perfecting is not righteousness—righteousness is merely its visible effect. To retain benevolence and righteousness is insufficient to understand that love and benefit arise from non-action. Thus, forgetting them is permissible, but merely forgetting their effects and expressions does not yet plumb the profound.

**[Subcommentary]**
To have forgotten benevolence and righteousness is gradually acceptable in principle, but your understanding remains shallow, so it is still not enough.

Another day, he met again and said: I have gained.

**[Subcommentary]**
“Another day” means a different time. With each day, his empty understanding renewed, and he met again. The progress he spoke of is detailed below.

He said: What do you mean?

**[Subcommentary]**
What is the meaning of your saying you have gained?

He said: I have forgotten ritual and music.

**[Subcommentary]**
Ritual is the root of chaos and disorder; music is the instrument of excess and dissipation. Their burdens are even heavier, so they are forgotten next.

He said: Good, but not yet sufficient.

**[Annotation]**
Ritual is the function of the body; music is the instrument of joy in life. To forget the instruments is not as good as forgetting that which produces the instruments.

**[Subcommentary]**
To have forgotten them is gradually acceptable, but it does not yet reach the ultimate.

Another day, he met again and said: I have gained.

He said: What do you mean?

**[Subcommentary]**
The meaning is no different from before.

He said: I have attained *zuowang* (sitting in forgetfulness).

**[Subcommentary]**
With an empty mind and nothing to cling to, one can sit upright and forget. The meaning of *zuowang* is explained below.

Zhongni started and said: What do you mean by *zuowang*?

**[Annotation]**
*Cu ran* describes a startled appearance. Since the forgetting has grown so deep, he is startled and asks: What is the meaning of *zuowang*?

Yan Hui said: I have dissolved my limbs and body, discarded my hearing and sight.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Liao* means to destroy or abandon. *Chu* means to withdraw or remove. Though hearing belongs to the ears and sight to the eyes, their function arises from the mind’s intelligence. Having awakened to the truth that the body is not truly one’s own and all realms are empty, one can destroy the four limbs and the hundred parts of the body, casting aside the mind’s intelligence, hearing, and sight.

I have departed from form and abandoned knowledge, becoming one with the Great Thoroughfare. This is called *zuowang*.

**[Annotation]**
What is there that *zuowang* does not forget? Having forgotten its conduct, it also forgets that which produces the conduct. Within, it is unaware of its own body; without, it does not recognize heaven and earth. Then, vast and open, it becomes one with transformation and is unobstructed in all things.

**[Subcommentary]**
The Great Thoroughfare is the great Dao. The Dao can penetrate and give life to the myriad things, thus it is called the Great Thoroughfare. Externally, one dissolves attachment to the body, seeing each part as illusory—this explains the dissolution of the limbs. Internally, one removes the mind’s knowledge, becoming utterly unaware—this explains the discarding of hearing and sight. Then, like withered wood or dead ashes, one merges with the great Dao. Such progress is called *zuowang*.

Zhongni said: To be the same is to have no preferences.

**[Annotation]**
When nothing is not the same, there is nothing one does not find suitable. When nothing is not suitable, what preferences or aversions can there be?

To transform is to have no constancy.

**[Annotation]**
To be the same as transformation is to follow only where transformation leads, thus there is no constancy.

**[Subcommentary]**
Having merged with the great Dao, one has no affirmations or negations, no preferences or aversions; having become one with change and transformation, one does not cling or stagnate in constancy.

"Yet is he truly worthy?"
"Qiu would follow behind him."

**[Subcommentary]**
*Guo* means "next." *Er* means "you." To have forgotten and abandoned all thus is surely to be a great worthy. Though Qiu is your teacher, he now falls behind you. To follow and learn from you—this is Qiu’s wish. This is Confucius humbly yielding himself to advance Yan Hui.

Ziyu and Zisang were friends, and for ten days there was ceaseless rain. Ziyu said: "Zisang must be in dire straits." He wrapped up rice and went to feed him.

**[Annotation]**
These two acted for one another without acting for one another. Now, wrapping rice to feed him arises from following heaven’s principle and happens of itself—it is not that he went only after acting for him.

**[Subcommentary]**
Rain lasting three days or more is called *lin*. *Dai* means "near." Zisang was poor, and with this ceaseless rain, he was near to starvation and illness. This matter is beyond doubt for those whose friendship transcends conventional bounds: one follows principle in going, and though he wrapped rice, there was no sentiment of acting for another.

When he reached Zisang’s gate, he heard sounds like singing, like weeping, as Zisang plucked his zither and said: "Father? Mother? Heaven?"

He entered the human realm.
There was one who could not bear the sound and so hastened to recite his verses.

**[Subcommentary]**
*Ren* means "to endure." *Qu* means "sudden and swift." Zisang, having suffered hunger and privation, thus produced the sound of his zither, asking from whom this hunger and poverty had come—whether from father or mother, or from man or husband. These were the words of his song and weeping. Unable to endure this sound, he then spontaneously recited his verses.

Ziyu entered and said: "Why do you recite verses in this manner?"
**[Annotation]**
He reproved him for having sentiment, for this hastened him far from the principle.
**[Subcommentary]**
One who is unified with life and death, who forgets sorrow and joy, who joins with others in non-joining—this is friendship beyond convention. Now, that you recite verses seems to harbor resentment, so I entered the gate in surprise and asked the reason.

He said: "I pondered who had brought me to this extremity, but I could not find the answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor and lowly? Heaven covers all without partiality; earth bears all without partiality. Would heaven and earth single me out for poverty? I sought the one who had done this, but I could not find him. Yet that I have come to this extremity is fate, is it not?"
**[Annotation]**
All things are spontaneous; none acts as a doer.
**[Subcommentary]**
Parents, in their kindness, do not wish their children to suffer hunger and cold. Heaven and earth are impartial—would they alone impoverish me? Considering the master and ruler, all is spontaneous. Seeking the origin, I found no sign at all. That I have come to this utter extremity is my allotted fate—what is there to resent?"

*Commentary and Subcommentary on the Nanhua Zhenjing, Scroll Nine*
*Annotated by Guo Xiang of Henan*

The Tang dynasty Master of Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying’s Subcommentary
*Inner Chapters, "Fit for Emperors and Kings," Seventh*

To be without intent yet entrust all to self-transformation—this is how one becomes fit for emperors and kings.

Nie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times received no answer.
*Subcommentary:* These four questions and four non-answers are the same four questions found in the *"Equalizing Things"* chapter. The Way of emperors and kings lies in nothing so much as forgetting knowledge, and thus this meaning is placed at the head of the chapter. As the *Laozi* says, "Not using wisdom to govern the state is the state’s virtue."

Thereupon Nie Que leapt up in great joy and went to tell Master Pu Yi.
Master Pu Yi said, "So only now do you know this?"
*Subcommentary:* Master Pu Yi was a worthy man of Yao’s time. At the age of eight, Shun took him as his teacher and offered him the throne, which he declined. He is the same as the Master Clad in Furs. Nie Que, having grasped the wondrous purport of non-knowing, leapt up in joy and ran to tell Master Pu Yi, yet still failed to fathom Wang Ni’s profound meaning. Pu Yi, a great worthy beyond the world, had already mastered the ultimate Dao of wordless understanding—how enduringly rooted in non-knowing! And only now, today, do you come to know it?

The House of Yu did not measure up to the House of Tai.
*Annotation:* The House of Yu and the House of Tai were both mere margins of worldly affairs, not worth recounting. What one flees is no escape at all—who in the world understands this? Before it was ever named, what victory or defeat could there be? Yet the unrecounted rides the flux of the many changes, spans the ten thousand generations, and though the world knows both peace and peril, recounting will always fall short.

*Subcommentary:* The House of Yu refers to Shun. The House of Tai refers to Tai Hao, that is, Fuxi. In the age of the Three Sovereigns, customs were pure and harmonious; by the time of the Five Emperors, mores had grown thin.

The age of strife and thinness operates through knowing to nurture things, while the age of purity and harmony preserves the real and governs through lodging—this is how the meaning of "not measuring up" may be verified.

The House of Yu, in its way, hoarded virtue to win over people. It did win people over, yet never emerged from the realm of "non-people."
*Annotation:* To take what people love as "people" and what they hate as "non-people" is to remain within the bounds of right and wrong. Only by stepping beyond the realm of "non-people" can one enter the state where there are no "non-people" at all. Thus, there is no gain, no loss, no right, no wrong—how could it be merely hoarding the Seven Virtues to win over people?

*Subcommentary:* Shun embraced the Seven Virtues and sought the allegiance of the common folk, thereby winning the hearts of the people. Yet he had not yet forgotten himself to merge with the world, so he remained within the realm of right and wrong. Some texts write *zang* (臧) as *cang* (藏). *Zang* means "good"—good at benevolence and righteousness, seeking the hearts of people.

The House of Tai moved with unhurried grace, awakening in carefree ease.
*Subcommentary:* *Xuxu* (徐徐) describes a relaxed and leisurely bearing; *yuyu* (于于), a self-contented demeanor. In Fuxi’s time, the pure customs still endured, so outwardly he was serene and unhurried, and in his awakening, joyful and at ease.

One moment he took himself for a horse, the next for an ox.
*Annotation:* In this way, how could there be any "people" or "non-people"? This is what it means to step beyond the realm of "non-people."
*Subcommentary:* Forgetting self and other, casting off right and wrong, he became horse or ox at others’ beck and call. If even beasts had no fixed nature, how could there be right or wrong?

His knowing was genuine and trustworthy.
*Annotation:* He let knowing be itself, so it was genuine and trustworthy.
*Subcommentary:* Following his true knowing, his feelings were free of pretense, thus truly trustworthy.

His virtue was utterly real.
*Annotation:* He let virtue be itself, so it was without falsity.
*Subcommentary:* Taking non-virtue as virtue, his virtue was without virtue, thus without falsity.

Yet he never entered the realm of "non-people."
*Annotation:* Not entering the realm of right and wrong is what sets him apart from the age of Yu.
*Subcommentary:* Following his true feelings, his virtue free of falsity, he transcended the bounds of knowing and never entered the realm of right and wrong.

Jian Wu met the madman Jie Yu. Jie Yu asked, "What did Ri Zhongshi tell you?"
*Subcommentary:* Jian Wu and Jie Yu have already been explained earlier. Ri Zhongshi was a worthy man, Jian Wu’s teacher. Since he was your teacher, what did he instruct you? This is Jie Yu posing the question.

Jian Wu replied, "He told me that a ruler must devise standards and measures from himself to govern others—who would dare not listen and be transformed?"
*Subcommentary:* *Shi* (式) means "to employ." He taught me the way of being a ruler and the method of transforming things: one must devise strategies from one’s own wisdom, employ benevolence and righteousness to guide customs, and then the people of the four directions—who would not listen? The distant masses—who would dare not submit?

Jie Yu said, "This is deceptive virtue."
*Annotation:* To impose one’s own standards on things is to make them lose their reality.
*Subcommentary:* Imposing one’s own standards on things makes them lose their reality—such deceptive virtue is not the true Way.

"In governing the world, it would be like crossing the sea by digging a river or making a flea carry a mountain."
*Annotation:* Entrusting oneself to the myriad things means nothing is left undone of itself. Trying to govern the world with one’s own body means no task is accomplished and no burden is borne.
*Subcommentary:* The vastness of the sea is deep and boundless, impossible to fathom, yet digging it into a river would yield no result. Likewise, the Way is distant and boundless, utterly beyond knowing, yet carving it into principles would be equally futile. A flea is tiny, a mountain immense—making it bear the load would be impossible. Governing with wisdom and ordering with benevolence, small virtue attempting great schemes—this is the same.

"Does the sage govern externally?"
*Annotation:* He governs only what lies within his own nature and destiny.
*Subcommentary:* He governs only what lies within his own nature and destiny, never extending beyond it.

"To govern externally is to say one does not govern. First rectify, then act."
*Annotation:* Each rectifies its own nature and destiny.
*Subcommentary:* First align with the true nature, then act to transform.

"Simply ensure that each can do what it is capable of."
*Annotation:* Do not do what one is incapable of.
*Subcommentary:* *Que* (确) means "solid." Align with the solid nature of things, enabling what each is capable of. Entrusting tasks accordingly, stopping at what lies within one’s nature, never reaching beyond.

"The cormorant flies high to avoid the harm of nets and arrows, while the mole digs deep beneath the sacred mound to escape the disaster of fumigation and digging."
*Annotation:* Even birds and beasts each have their own way of preserving themselves. Thus, if the emperor-king entrusts things to themselves and does not act, they will naturally come to completion.
*Subcommentary:* *Zeng* (缯) is a net; *yi* (弋), shooting with an arrow tied to a string. *Yanshu* (鼹鼠) is a small mouse; *shenqiu* (神丘), the altar of the earth god. The bird flies high to escape the net, the mouse digs deep to avoid fumigation—both follow their nature spontaneously, needing no instruction to avoid harm. If even birds and mice do this, so too do humans. Thus, to devise standards and impose principles is the height of deception. How could you fail to recognize the wisdom of these two creatures?"

*Annotation:* Do you truly not know that these two creatures each preserve themselves without needing instruction?
*Subcommentary:* *Er* (而) means "you." Do you not know that these two creatures, without instruction, naturally avoid harm and preserve themselves? If even they, digging deep and flying high, are not without wisdom, how much more so for humans? Yet you would devise standards and impose principles to deceive and manipulate things—is this not delusion?

Tian Gen wandered to Yin Yang and came to the banks of Meng Water, where he happened upon an unnamed man and asked him, "May I ask how to govern the world?"

The *Subcommentary* states: "Tian Gen" and "Unnamed Man" are both fictitious names, serving as allegorical figures in a dialogue. "Yin Yang" refers to the southern slope of Yin Mountain. "Meng Water" lies within the borders of Zhao. "Encountered" means "met." Tian Gen, wandering along the mountains and rivers, happened upon the Unnamed Man and questioned him, his inquiry concerning the governance of the world.

The Unnamed Man replied: "Begone! You are a vulgar man—why do you ask such unwelcome questions?"

*Annotation:* To ask about governing the world is to fail to begin from the Great Beginning and end in the Dark Obscurity.

*Subcommentary:* You are a coarse and ignorant man—you should leave at once. The intent of your question brings me no joy. "I am about to become a man with the Creator of Things."

*Annotation:* Allowing people to act of their own accord.

*Subcommentary:* When the Creator makes a man, each is endowed with a natural allotment—why labor to devise laws and impose governance? Since all is one with the Great Thoroughfare, one simply lets be without aiding.

"When weary, I then ride the boundless bird, soaring beyond the Six Directions, and wander in the land of Nothing Whatever, dwelling in the vast and boundless wilds."

*Annotation:* "Boundless" refers to the myriad fragments. Riding the myriad fragments, one gallops through the ten thousand things, thus able to come and go with constant freedom, without any constricted or stagnant place.

*Subcommentary:* "Boundless" means profound and deep. "Vast and boundless" is a term for expansive breadth. The bird is chosen for its lightness and ease of ascent. The Six Directions are like the Six Harmonies. The sage who governs the world is tranquil and inactive, in great accord with the nature of things, akin to the transformations of creation. If he ceases activity and returns to the root, weary of the world, then he rides the profound and distant Dao, soaring through the void and vanishing without trace. He transcends the Six Harmonies in freedom, advances into Nothing Whatever in carefree wandering, concentrates his spirit and wisdom on the shooting star, and abides in the clear and empty wilderness. In this way, how could there be any governing of the world? It is simply non-action.

"Why do you disturb my heart with such questions about governing the world?"

*Annotation:* All things are left to their own self-attainment, and thus they govern themselves without governance.

*Subcommentary:* If one lets things be and allows them to follow their course, all things transform themselves. What need is there for elaborate schemes to sing of governance? Why do you agitate my heart in this way?

The Unnamed Man asked again.

*Subcommentary:* Tian Gen had not yet understood, so he posed another question.

The Unnamed Man said: "Let your mind wander in simplicity, unite your *qi* with stillness."

*Annotation:* When one follows one’s nature without adornment, that is simplicity. To be still in one’s nature and abide therein.

*Subcommentary:* Direct your mind and spirit to the realm of tranquility, unite your form and *qi* with the land of silence. Let both form and spirit be utterly empty and still. Only then will the world transform itself without need of governance. Follow the self-so of things without harboring private designs, and the world will be well-ordered.

*Annotation:* To let nature take its course is impartial; to seek to augment it with the mind’s desires is partial. Partiality is truly insufficient for generating life, while following the impartial preserves it wholly.

*Subcommentary:* Follow the nature of things as transformed by creation, comply with the inherent tendencies of the self-so, without harboring private designs or imposing governance. Let things be, and both self and others will be preserved whole.

Yang Ziju saw Lao Dan and said: "Suppose there were a man here—quick-witted and resolute, penetrating and perspicacious, diligent in the study of the Dao without weariness. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?"

*Subcommentary:* His surname was Yang, his given name Zhu, and his courtesy name Ziju. He asked Laozi about the way of the enlightened king: Suppose there were a man whose nature was keen and swift, whose spirit and intelligence responded as swiftly as an echo, who handled affairs with strength and decisiveness, who discerned things with clarity and thoroughness, who studied the Dao with unflagging diligence. Could such a man be compared in virtue to an enlightened king or sage emperor?

Lao Dan said: "Compared to the sage, such a man is but a menial, entangled by skills, wearied in body and troubled in mind."

*Annotation:* Such abilities cannot secure one’s person, and are insufficient to compare with a sage ruler.

*Subcommentary:* If one were to compare such a man to a sage ruler, he would be no more than a laborer, altering his appearance through toil. His skills and craft entangle his spirit, causing weariness, so his form changes; entangled, his mind is troubled. "Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards bring hunters, the agility of monkeys brings trappers, and the skill of foxes in catching foxes brings leashing. Could such as these be compared to an enlightened king?"

*Annotation:* All these are entangled by their patterns and skills, not riding the empty to master the boundless.

*Subcommentary:* "Leashing" means binding. "Monkey" refers to the macaque. The skins of tigers and leopards have patterns, hence they attract hunters. Monkeys, with their agility in leaping, are inevitably bound by ropes. Dogs, skilled in catching foxes, are often leashed by the neck. If one were to compare the quick-witted man to a sage emperor, then these three creatures could also be compared to an enlightened king.

Yang Ziju, startled, said: "May I ask about the governance of the enlightened king?"

*Subcommentary:* Having asked amiss, he was taken aback and changed his expression, then respectfully inquired again about the principles of enlightened kingship.

Lao Dan said: "The achievements of the enlightened king cover the world yet seem not his own."

*Annotation:* If the world lacked an enlightened ruler, none could attain self-realization. What is now called self-realization is truly the achievement of the enlightened king. Yet his achievement lies in non-action, and the return lies with the world. All attain self-mastery, so it seems not the enlightened king’s achievement.

*Subcommentary:* The sage’s governance is as encompassing as creation, as all-embracing as heaven and earth, yet his achievements remain unclaimed, so they seem not his own work. "He transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him."

*Annotation:* The enlightened king fully satisfies the nature of things, so each person says, "I am thus of myself," without knowing their reliance on the enlightened king.

The sage guides and transforms the multitudes, bidding them forsake evil; he bestows upon the ten thousand things, granting them blessings for their goodness. Yet his profound power works in hidden depths, unknown in daily use, so the common people say, "I am thus of myself," without relying on the ruler’s virtue. His achievements remain unnamed, allowing all things to rejoice of their own accord.

*Annotation:* Though his merit encompasses all under heaven, he does not claim it as his own name, so all things believe they have attained it themselves and rejoice.

*Subcommentary:* "Mo" means "none"; "ju" means "to display." He ascribes merit to all things rather than making his name known, so each thing attains its own fulfillment and delights in contentment.

He stands in the unfathomable,
*Annotation:* Dwelling in the path of transformation, ever-renewing and without fixed form.

and wanders in the realm of nothingness.
*Annotation:* When he embodies the ten thousand things, his wanderings are in emptiness. If he cannot merge with things, he will be endlessly occupied in responding to them—how could he then wander in emptiness?

*Subcommentary:* "Nothingness" is the wondrous root. In establishing virtue and accomplishing merit, his spirit is profound and unknowable, yet he is at once on the path and at the root, thus ever roaming his mind in the ultimate.

In Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian,
*Subcommentary:* In the state of Zheng there was a diviner of extraordinary spiritual power, highly accurate in his predictions. Having come from Qi, his surname was Ji and his given name Xian.

who knew men’s deaths and lives, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise, predicting them by the year, month, ten-day period, or day, as if he were a spirit. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled in haste,
*Annotation:* They disliked hearing of their own death dates.
*Subcommentary:* His divinations of good and ill fortune were never in error; he fixed the time with precision, as if verified by spirits. No one wished to hear of impending misfortune in advance, so they fled to avoid him.

but when Liezi saw him, he was entranced. Returning home, he told Master Hu,
*Subcommentary:* Liezi’s progress in learning is detailed in the "Free and Easy Wandering" chapter; it need not be repeated here. Master Hu was an adept of the Dao in Zheng, known as Huzi, with the given name Lin—Liezi’s teacher. Seeing Ji Xian’s minor arts, as accurate as if he were a spirit, Liezi was filled with admiration, as if intoxicated. Upon returning, he told his teacher all that had transpired.

saying, "At first I took the Master’s Way to be the ultimate, but now there is something even more ultimate."
*Annotation:* He meant that Ji Xian’s attainment surpassed even the Master’s.
*Subcommentary:* "The Master" refers to Huzi; "ultimate" means "supreme." Initially, upon receiving instruction, he believed the Master’s Way to be the highest, but now, having seen Ji Xian, he found his Way even more supreme. These were Liezi’s words of infatuation.

Master Hu said, "I have taught you only the outward forms, not yet the reality—do you truly believe you have attained the Dao?
*Subcommentary:* "Yu" means "to teach"; "ji" means "exhaust." Compared to what I have taught you, I have only conveyed the literary expressions, not yet the profound essence. You cling to words, believing you have grasped the Dao—how do you know the fish-trap and rabbit-snare are not the fish and rabbit themselves?

With many hens but no rooster, how can there be eggs?"
*Annotation:* This speaks of Liezi’s lack of true attainment.
*Subcommentary:* With many hens and no rooster, there can be no eggs. Since you have only form without substance, how can you possess the Dao?

If you contend with the world using the Dao and insist on being believed, you make it possible for others to divine your fate.
*Annotation:* Without true attainment, you still have a mind; having a mind, you contend with one aspect of the world, seeking to be believed—thus others can divine your fate.
*Subcommentary:* You use the Dao of words to contend with the world, lacking great wisdom yet trusting in petty skills—this is why Ji Xian could divine your fate.

Come with him and let me show myself to him."
*Subcommentary:* The perfected person is serene and remote, his spirit profound and unknowable, at rest in stillness yet responsive in movement—beyond the measure of ordinary minds. Thus he summoned Ji Xian to come and observe him.

The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu. When they departed, Ji Xian said to Liezi, "Alas!"

"Your master is dead. He cannot live again. It will not be ten days before he perishes. I saw something strange in him—he resembled damp ashes."

*Subcommentary:* Alas! This is an exclamation of surprise. Zilin showed his still and desolate countenance, and Ji Xian declared he would die. The omen of strangeness had already manifested; within ten days, the sign of his demise would be like damp ashes.

Liezi entered, his tears soaking his lapels as he told Master Hu. Master Hu said, "I changed my manifestation to show him the *earthly pattern*, sprouting yet neither trembling nor upright."

*Annotation:* Sprouting yet unmoving, neither correcting itself—like a withered tree sharing its lack of bloom, or damp ashes equal in their lifeless stillness—this is the time when the perfected person is without response. The perfected person’s movement is like heaven, their stillness like earth; their flowing is like water, their cessation like the profound silence of an abyss. The abyss’s silence and water’s flow, heaven’s movement and earth’s stillness—these are not acts of doing yet arise of themselves, all one in nature. Now, when Ji Xian saw him dwelling like a corpse and sitting in oblivion, he called it impending death; when he beheld his spirit moving and heaven following, he declared it life. Truly, response does not rely on the mind, for principle naturally aligns with the mysterious tally. Ascending and descending with transformation, measuring by the world—only then can one be master of things and follow the boundless flow of time without limit. Thus, such a one is beyond the divination of soothsayers. This is the great meaning of *Responding to Emperors and Kings*.

*Subcommentary:* *Pattern* means form; *trembling* means movement. Earth is tranquil through its lack of intent, so its pattern is stillness. Sprouting yet still, never trembling, without intent yet upright—its form resembles collapse. This is the time when the great sage is without response, and the petty shaman calls it death. Yet Master Hu’s manifestations have four levels: first, showing the wondrous root’s empty concentration, still and unmoving; second, showing the near descent of responsive activation, moving yet not still; third, the root and branches merging, movement and stillness as one; fourth, the root and branches both forgotten, movement and stillness both transcended. This is the first: the wondrous root’s empty concentration, still and unmoving. It is nearly like seeing my *blocked virtue-mechanism*."

*Annotation:* When the virtue-mechanism does not activate, it is called *blocked*.

*Subcommentary:* *Nearly* means approaching; *blocked* means obstructed; *mechanism* means movement. The mechanism of utmost virtue is sealed and unactivated. Showing its congealed tranquility resembles damp ashes, and the petty shaman, in his vulgarity, nearly saw this.

"Try bringing him again."

*Subcommentary:* Previously, he falsely claimed I was dead; now, he summons him again to come once more.

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Master Hu again. When they departed, Ji Xian said to Liezi, "Fortunate indeed that your master met me! There is hope now—he is fully alive again!"

*Subcommentary:* This is the second: the near descent of responsive activation, moving yet not still. Showing the responsive countenance, his spirit and qi stirred slightly, no longer like withered wood but entirely like his usual self. Yet he falsely attributed this sagely power to his own skill, claiming it was fortunate to have met him—how mistakenly he took credit for the cure! "I saw his *blocked potentiality*."

Here, "power" (*quan*) means "mechanism." Now, he himself realizes that what he saw yesterday was merely the *blocked mechanism*, hence he declared him near death.

*Subcommentary:* "Power" (*quan*) means "mechanism." Previously, at a single glance, he saw only something like damp ashes—blocked mechanism, utterly devoid of responsive movement. Today, having met me, he awaits full revival. How shallow the petty shaman’s knowledge, to so presumptuously claim credit!

Liezi entered and reported this to Master Hu. Master Hu said: "Just now, I showed him *Heaven-and-Earth*."

*Annotation:* Within Heaven-and-Earth, the power of covering and bearing is manifest. Compared to *Earth’s Pattern*, this is not merely external—it is the countenance of responsive activation.

*Subcommentary:* "Earth" (*rang*) means the ground. To show him *Heaven-and-Earth* is to display the countenance of responsive movement. Like the Two Modes covering and bearing the myriad things, the perfected one’s responsive activation follows the same principle. *Name and reality do not enter*—

*Annotation:* When one covers and bears through natural spontaneity, the celestial mechanism responds mysteriously, and the adornments of fame and profit become discarded things.

*Subcommentary:* Though he descends to mingle with the dust and harmonizes his light to benefit beings, fame and true reality never enter his numinous core. *—yet the mechanism arises from the heels.*

*Annotation:* It always arises from the utmost extremity.

*Subcommentary:* "Heels" (*zhong*) means the root. Though things stir and move in response, he never loses timely appropriateness, for this numinous mechanism issues from the wondrous root, moving yet ever still. *This is nearly seeing my good mechanism.*

*Annotation:* The mechanism arises and is good for him, so he sees it.

*Subcommentary:* He showed the good mechanism, responding to the Two Modes. Ji Xian, seeing this form and countenance, called it "good." To be "fully alive" is precisely what it means to see the good.

"Try bringing him again."

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Master Hu again. When they departed, Ji Xian said to Liezi: "Your master is unsettled. I cannot fathom his signs. Let him settle himself, and I will observe him again."

*Subcommentary:* This is the third: showing the non-duality of root and traces, movement and stillness as one. The perfected one’s virtue is full, wisdom complete; his empty mind congeals in illumination. Root and traces are not separate, movement and stillness not distinct. His Dao is profoundly mysterious—how could a petty shaman plumb it? He means to settle his mind and advance, then try observing him again. Not daring to definitively predict fortune or misfortune, he merely says, "I will observe him again."

Liezi entered and reported this to Master Hu. Master Hu said: "Just now, I showed him *Supreme Vacuity, No Victory*."

*Annotation:* Abiding at the extremity of Supreme Vacuity, one governs the mind with vastness and harmonizes with the ten thousand directions. Thus, victory and defeat cannot find a place to intervene.

*Subcommentary:* "Vacuity" (*chong*) means emptiness; "no" (*mo*) means without. The sage’s illumination is profoundly congealed, equal in measure to the Great Vacuity. Root and traces are non-dual, movement and stillness simultaneous—there is no superiority or inferiority, so what victory or defeat could there be? *This is the first time he sees my balanced qi-mechanism.*

*Annotation:* Without names, there is no imbalance; all is merged into one. To those who gauge Heaven with a tube, its limits are unseen, so it seems unsettled.

*Subcommentary:* "Balanced" (*heng*) means level. Root and traces are one, no superiority or inferiority; the spirit and qi are equal, responding to the mechanism in this way. The petty shaman, seeing only what is near, cannot fathom what is distant. His mind is confused, which is why he asks for settlement.

*"The abyss is known by nine names—here, three are given:*
*The abyss where the *kui*-fish coils,*
*The abyss of still water,*
*The abyss of flowing water."*

*Annotation:* By "abyss" is meant stillness and silence. Water is ever without mind, yielding and following external things. Thus, whether flowing or still, whether the *kui*-fish coils or the dragon leaps, it remains profoundly self-possessed, never losing its stillness and silence. The perfected one acts when employed, ceases when set aside. Though action and cessation differ, his profound silence remains one. Thus, I briefly cite three differences to illustrate this. Though waves surge in nine transformations, and order and chaos intermingle, he who abides at the extremity remains serenely self-possessed, utterly forgetting all doing.

*Subcommentary:* This is a metaphor. The *kui* is a great fish; "coils" (*huan*) means to spiral. "Known" (*shen*) means to gather. The water’s nature is without mind, its movement and stillness following things. Whether the whale coils, the dragon soars, the water congeals in stillness, or the waves surge in turbulence—though the ripples and currents vary in myriad ways, its profound silence remains without mind, its essence unified. Thus, the coiled *kui* is likened to the balanced qi, still water to *Earth’s Pattern*, and flowing water to *Heaven-and-Earth*. Though these three differ, their empty illumination is one.

As for the abyss having nine names, they are: the abyss of the coiled *kui*, the abyss of still water, the abyss of flowing water, the abyss of overflowing water, the abyss of flooding water, the abyss of wave water, the abyss of dammed water, the abyss of patterned water, and the abyss of rich water—hence the nine. All appear in the *Liezi*; that text records them in full, while here only these three are briefly cited.

"Try bringing him again."

[Commentary] Desiring to reveal the utmost mystery, it was necessary to summon him again.

The next day, he was brought once more to see Master Hu. Before he could steady himself, he lost his bearings and fled.

[Commentary] In previous encounters, Ji Xian had gauged and assessed him, yet the profound and distant remained unmanifest, still clouded by superficial perceptions. Now, in this fourth meeting, the Way had reached its deepest, where root and trace were both forgotten, movement and stillness both transcended. Where the sage’s mind moved, the ordinary could not fathom—thus, before he could stand firm, he bolted in flight.

Master Yazi said, “Pursue him.”

[Commentary] Having witnessed his flight, he commanded that he be seized.

Liezi pursued but could not overtake him. Returning, he reported to Master Hu, saying, “He has vanished! He is lost! I could not catch him.”

[Commentary] Overwhelmed by terror, he fled with such speed that he was gone—lost—no one knew where.

Master Hu said, “I showed him only that which had never yet departed from my source.”

[Annotation] Though its transformations are boundless, it ever abides in the deep root of tranquility.

[Commentary] The wondrous origin of the mysterious source lies in the obscure and indistinct, transcending the four propositions, leaving behind the hundred negations. It cannot be grasped by thought or known by deliberation—how then could it be seized by form or name? Having severed all speech and image, without fixed source or path, its course unfathomable, he lost himself and fled. I met him with emptiness and yielded to his flow,

[Annotation] Without mind, following the transformations of things.

not knowing who or what he was,

[Annotation] Drifting without attachment.

[Commentary] *Wei yi* describes the manner of yielding and compliance. The perfected one responds to things with emptiness, forgetting self and intent, adapting to the moment without clinging to any root. Since it cannot be named or defined, one knows not who or what it truly is. Thus, it becomes like crumbling decay, like surging waves—hence his flight.

[Annotation] In dissolution and decline, in the ebb and flow of worldly affairs, there is nowhere it does not follow. Though the perfected one is one, he moves with the changes of the age, so the diviner finds no place to fix his gaze and flees in disarray. This illustrates that one who would respond as emperor to the world acts without fixed method.

[Commentary] *Tui* means to let go; *mi* means to comply. The highest virtue is without intent, responding only when moved. Letting go without exertion, complying with things, it stirs the dust of the world and flows with its currents, following the moment without obstruction. In its thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, it remains beyond the diviner’s ken—thus Ji Xian rightly fled.

Thereafter, Liezi realized he had never truly learned and returned home.

[Commentary] Only after Ji Xian’s flight did Liezi awaken to his own delusion, perceiving at last the depth of Master Hu’s Way and the shallowness of the divine seer. Knowing he had not yet learned, he begged to withdraw, to cultivate non-action and devote himself to the mysterious study. For three years, he did not emerge.

He cooked for his wife and fed pigs as he would feed people.
**[Annotation]** Forgetting distinctions of noble and base.
**[Commentary]** Before three years had passed, he secluded himself from worldly affairs. Cooking for his wife, he forgot honor and disgrace; feeding pigs as he would people, he treated filth and purity as equal. In matters, he held no partiality—
**[Annotation]** Whatever he encountered was all.
**[Commentary]** Awakened to the ultimate principle, he equalized self and other; engaging in worldly affairs, he made no distinction of near or far. Carving and polishing returned to simplicity—
**[Annotation]** Discarding ornament to embrace reality.
**[Commentary]** All tasks of carving and polishing, all embellishments, he cast aside, resting in unadorned truth to return to the Way of simplicity. Like a clod of earth, he stood alone in his form—
**[Annotation]** External adornments were gone.
**[Commentary]** *Kuai ran*: the appearance of being without emotion. Outwardly, he shed all ornament; inwardly, he rejected cunning and intellect. His form was like a withered tree, solitary and unmatched. Though entangled in the world’s dust, he guarded his true nature—
**[Annotation]** Though active, his essence remained undispersed.
**[Commentary]** *Feng*: to guard. Though he engaged with the world’s entanglements, harmonizing with things, he preserved his original truth, steadfast and unshaken. He ended as he began—
**[Annotation]** Letting things fulfill themselves.
**[Commentary]** In movement, he did not stray from stillness; though divided by disturbance, he guarded his truth. In response, he did not depart from reality, ever embracing the One from beginning to end. He did not become a vessel of fame—
**[Annotation]** Following things, each bore its own name.
**[Commentary]** *Shi*: master. Even his body was forgotten—where then could fame reside? Thus, he no longer served as master of reputation. He did not become a storehouse of schemes—
**[Annotation]** Letting things devise their own plans.
**[Commentary]** Empty and serene, without intent, he entrusted all to things, no longer harboring schemes in his spirit’s abode. He did not take on tasks—
**[Annotation]** Entrusting each thing to fulfill its own role.
**[Commentary]** Each followed its natural allotment, letting things act of their own accord, no longer burdening himself with affairs. He did not become a master of knowledge—
**[Annotation]** Without intent, each thing mastered its own knowledge.
**[Commentary]** Forgetting the mind, severing thought, he followed the natural course of all beings, never employing knowledge to govern things. His embodiment encompassed the boundless—
**[Annotation]** Following the self-directed nature of the world, he roamed among the ten thousand things without limit.
**[Commentary]** Realizing the true source, he merged with the wisdom of the boundless—thus all things were inexhaustible. And he wandered without trace—
**[Annotation]** Entrusting all to things, he left no boundary.
**[Commentary]** *Zhen*: trace. Though he roamed the world, aiding all beings, he concealed his brilliance, leaving no mark. He fulfilled what he received from Heaven—
**[Annotation]** When sufficient, he stopped.
**[Commentary]** Each thing’s endowment from Heaven differed; each exhausted its capacity, yet none found it lacking. Without appearing to gain—
**[Annotation]** To appear to gain is to not know when to stop.
**[Commentary]** What the eye sees, though seen, is not truly seen; what is gained within one’s allotment, though gained, is not truly gained. Having no intent to see or gain, though he saw and gained, it was as if he did not. It was emptiness alone—
**[Annotation]** Without emptiness, one cannot bear the fullness of things.
**[Commentary]** That he exhausted his allotment without appearing to gain was simply due to his empty heart, forgetting all. The perfected person’s mind is like a mirror—
**[Annotation]** Reflecting things without emotion.
**[Commentary]** A mirror hung in a high hall reflects whatever comes before it; the perfected person’s empty response follows the same principle. Neither sending off nor welcoming,
responding yet not storing—
**[Annotation]** It reflects what comes and ceases when it goes.
**[Commentary]** *Jiang*: to send off. Things come and go, yet the mirror neither welcomes nor sends them away; what comes is reflected, yet nothing is concealed. Likewise, the sage’s wisdom, empty and still, illuminates even the hidden. Things move, and he responds—not with the heart, without sending or welcoming, how could he conceal anything with emotion? Thus, he could master things without harm—
**[Annotation]** Things come, and it reflects them; reflecting without intent, even if the whole world came to be mirrored, there would be no weariness of spirit.
**[Commentary]** Things arise and perish, yet the mirror neither conceals nor reveals—thus it can always reflect things without being harmed. Likewise, the sage’s virtue harmonizes with the two poles, his clarity equal to the three luminaries; his illumination vast, his embrace impartial. His mind unwearied, he suffers no harm, for he masters things without injury.

The Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Center was Hundun.
**[Commentary]** The Southern Sea is the realm of brightness, thus Shu represents being. The North is the domain of darkness, thus Hu represents non-being. The Center is neither North nor South, thus Hundun represents neither being nor non-being. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well.
**[Commentary]** The two minds of being and non-being met in the realm of neither being nor non-being, harmonizing the two partial perspectives into a single central intent—thus it is said he treated them very well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s virtue, saying: "All people have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only this one has none. Let us try to bore them."
**[Commentary]** Shu and Hu, clinging to partiality, could not harmonize; still moved by the impulse to learn, they forgot Hundun’s lack of intent and thought drilling apertures would be beneficial. Each day they bored one aperture, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.
**[Annotation]** To act is to ruin.
**[Commentary]** Applying the four limbs to cling to conditions, boring seven apertures to be stained by dust, violating Hundun’s perfect purity, following the grasping of being and non-being—thus he did not complete his Heavenly years, dying midway. Let scholars take heed and avoid this fate. Thus Guo’s annotation says: "To act is to ruin."

*End of the Tenth Scroll of the Zhuangzi’s Annotations and Commentaries*
*Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan*

**Commentary by Tang Dynasty Master of the Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying**

**Outer Chapters, "Webbed Toes" (Chapter Eight)**

Webbed toes and supernumerary fingers emerge from one’s nature—yet they exceed in virtue.

**[Subcommentary]** *Bing* (骈) means "joined"; *mu* (拇) refers to the big toe. It denotes the big toe and the second toe grown together as one. *Zhizhi* (枝指) refers to an extra finger branching from the side of the thumb, resulting in six fingers. "Emerge from one’s nature" means these webbed or branched digits are both endowed by nature, present within the generative mandate of life. *Chi* (侈) means "excess." *De* (德) refers to the five virtues: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. This states that Zengzi and Shun’s discernment of the five virtues, stored within the five viscera, is not superfluous to nature.

Hanging tumors and pendulous wens emerge from one’s form—yet they exceed in nature.

**[Annotation]** What is long is not considered surplus; what is short is not considered deficient. Thus, both webbed and non-webbed growths arise from form and nature, not borrowed from external things. Yet while webbed and non-webbed are each sufficient in their own way, these alone are webbed or branched, appearing excessive to others—hence called *chi* ("excess"). Deluded ones may claim these are not of nature, seeking to excise and discard them. This would mean the Dao has no place to abide, virtue has no vessel to bear it, humans discard talent, and things discard their use—how could this be the intent of perfect governance? Things have their sizes, capacities their quantities; what is large is webbed, what is numerous is superfluous. The distinction between webbed and superfluous exists in all things. To refuse their function is to discard the nature of the myriad things entirely.

**[Subcommentary]** Attached growths of flesh and dangling wens both arise only after form is endowed—thus they emerge from form and exceed nature. For example, Li Kuang’s innate intelligence, stored within the organs, is not acquired through study, so it does not exceed nature. Those who employ benevolence and righteousness in manifold ways are arrayed within the five viscera—yet this is not the true alignment of the Dao and virtue.

Those who merge with things in darkness do so without excess. Thus, those who employ benevolence and righteousness in manifold ways, though arrayed within the five viscera, merely adhere to the orthodoxy of a single school—they cannot align with things without distinction and rectify each according to its nature and destiny. Hence, this is not the true alignment of the Dao and virtue. The degrees of distinction in these ways are without limit in the world, yet the gradations of more and less each have their fixed allotment. Even a difference as slight as a hair’s tip cannot be transgressed. Thus, if each guards its own distinction, then more and less will all attain their proper place. Yet some, hearing that excess cannot rectify deficiency, seek to discard the many and rely on the few—this is to cast aside the entire world, is it not absurd?

**[Subcommentary]** *Distinction* refers to the unfolding of the Dao. The virtues of Zeng and Shi abound in benevolence and righteousness, arrayed within the viscera and put into practice—this is merely the wisdom of a single school, unable to merge with the myriad things in boundless darkness. Those who can merge with things do not cling to righteousness yet respond to righteousness, neither excess nor deficiency yet respond to excess and deficiency. In endless transformations, they harmonize with things without end, free from partiality—this is the true alignment of the Dao and virtue.

Thus, what is webbed in the feet is conjoined flesh without use; what is branched in the hands is an extra finger without use.
**[Annotation]** These arise simply because nature and destiny cannot be otherwise, not because they serve a purpose.
**[Subcommentary]** The conjoined big toe is of no benefit to walking; though such flesh exists, it remains ultimately without use. The extra finger branching from the hand offers no aid in grasping; though such flesh is present, it is ultimately a useless digit. This illustrates that such things are endowed by natural heavenly nature, not generated to assist function.

Those whose emotions are webbed and branched within the five viscera indulge in deviant conduct through benevolence and righteousness.
**[Annotation]** The emotions of the five viscera are naturally manifold, yet those with fewer distinctions forcibly emulate them, leading to excess and deviance, losing the perfect equilibrium within the body.
**[Subcommentary]** The followers of Zeng and Shi, by nature abundant in benevolence and righteousness, allow these emotions to become webbed within the viscera. Those of lesser nature, distorting their true disposition, pride themselves on such conduct and seek heavenly principle—yet lacking spontaneity, they fall into deviance. *Deviance* means stagnation; *perversity* describes unorthodox appearance. They multiply distinctions in the use of intelligence.
**[Annotation]** The use of intelligence has its proper allotment; thus, manifold distinctions are not excessive, nor are few distinctions deficient. Yet the sway of human desires invariably devalues the few and esteems the many. Seeing what is esteemed, they distort themselves to emulate it, thereby exceeding their inherent use and straining their natural disposition. If, however, one forgets what is esteemed and preserves one’s original allotment, then one remains without excess in nature while embracing all distinctions.
**[Subcommentary]** Li Kuang’s original allotment exceeds others in intelligence, yet those of lesser nature distort their emotions to emulate him—is this not deluded?

Thus, what is webbed in clarity disrupts the five colors, indulges in ornate patterns, and dazzles with the brilliance of blue and yellow, vermilion and green—is this not Li Zhu? Indeed, it is.
**[Subcommentary]** The character *wěi* (鮪) denotes an axe-shaped pattern. *Zuò* (做) means two *jǐ* (己) characters back-to-back. The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black. Blue and red form *patterns*; red and white form *ornamentation*. *Huánghuáng* (煌煌) describes a blinding radiance. Is this not Li Zhu? It is. The character *yǐ* (已) is an auxiliary sound. Li Zhu, also called Li Lou, was a keen-sighted man from the time of the Yellow Emperor who could discern the tip of a hair at a hundred paces.

What is excessive in hearing disrupts the five notes, indulges in the six pitch-standards, and clings to the sounds of metal, stone, silk, bamboo, the Yellow Bell, and the Great Regulator—is this not Shi Kuang? Indeed, it is.
**[Annotation]** Those with ears and eyes never trouble themselves by aspiring to deafness or blindness; their trouble always lies in yearning for Li Zhu and Shi Kuang. Thus, though Li Zhu and Shi Kuang are by nature keen of sight and hearing, they become the very agents that disrupt the senses.
**[Subcommentary]** The five notes are *gōng* (宮), *shāng* (商), *jué* (角), *zhǐ* (徵), and *yǔ* (羽). The six pitch-standards include the Yellow Bell, the Great Regulator, Guxi, Linzhong, Wuyi, and Jiazhong. The six pitch-standards are yang; the six pitch-pipes are yin, totaling twelve. The eight sounds are metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, and wood. *Is this not* means clinging to these sounds—is this not Shi Kuang? Shi Kuang, styled Ziye, was a music master of Duke Ping of Jin, profoundly versed in musical harmony. Li Zhu and Shi Kuang, in their original allotment of keen sight and hearing, are emulated by the benighted—having lost their true nature, are they not troubled? Yet their clarity and keenness become the very agents that disrupt the senses.

What is branched in benevolence plucks at virtue and obstructs nature to gather fame, causing the world to clamor like reeds and drums in service of unattainable standards—is this not Zeng and Shi? Indeed, it is.
**[Annotation]** Zeng and Shi were by nature inclined toward benevolence, yet those not so inclined forcibly emulate them, and their emulation of benevolence becomes artificial. The world never emulates Jie’s depravity but instead clamors to follow Zeng and Shi—thus, Zeng and Shi’s fame stirs the world to lose its true nature, more grievously than even Jie’s tyranny.
**[Subcommentary]** *Branched in benevolence* means their original allotment is excessive in benevolence and righteousness, like an extra finger branching from the hand. Displaying the five virtues, they become mired in partiality and deviance, obstructing their true nature. In their dealings with others, they gather fame, causing the common people to rush about in competition, like reeds and drums stirring emotions.

Yet Zeng and Shi were by nature abundant in benevolence and righteousness, while those not so endowed forcibly emulate them, grasping at shortcomings to mimic strengths—thus they uphold laws beyond their reach. *Extraction* means to pluck out; it refers to plucking false virtue, thereby obstructing their true nature.

Zeng was surnamed Zeng, named Shen, styled Ziyu, a disciple of Confucius. Shi was surnamed Shi, named Zeng, styled Ziyu, a minister to Duke Ling of Wei. These two men were both endowed by nature with benevolence and filial piety, hence they are cited as examples.

*Branched in disputation*—like knotting cords or weaving sentences, they roam the mind amid questions of "hard and white" or "same and different," yet exhaust themselves in vaunting useless words—are they not like Yang and Mo?

**[Annotation]** Those who gallop in strange disputation and vie in perilous rhetoric have never paused to ponder the rivers of Taowu, yet they vie in disputation amid the questions of Yang and Mo—thus Yang and Mo become the masters of chaotic discourse.

**[Subcommentary]** Yang was surnamed Yang, named Zhu, styled Ziju, a native of Song. Mo was named Di, also of Song, a grandee of that state; as he practiced the Way of ink, he was called Mo. These two men and their followers, abandoning their true nature, indulged in excessive disputation, all capable of lofty and perilous rhetoric that stirred the nature of things, obstinately clinging to right and wrong. Like knotting and concealing phrases to make them difficult to unravel, their roaming minds in learning dwelt solely on debates over "holding fast to the white" and questions of "same and different," never emerging from the realm of inhumanity.

*Arrogance* arises from self-reliance, and also describes the appearance of exertion. *Praise* means to glorify and commend. The followers of Yang and Mo both flaunt their petty learning, dazzling the multitude, boasting of useless words, and confusing the common people—then are Yang and Mo not the teachers of disorder? This refers precisely to Yang and Mo.

Thus all these are ways of excessive branching and side growths, not the ultimate correctness of the world.

**[Annotation]** These several masters all follow their natural endowments, truly abundant in branching and side growths, each being the correctness of their own school. Yet to take one correctness and apply it to the myriad things is to render the myriad things incorrect. Therefore, the ultimately correct does not use its own correctness to correct the world, but allows the world each to attain its own correctness.

**[Subcommentary]** These several masters all possess natural intelligence, benevolence, and disputation, like conjoined thumbs or extra fingers branching from the side—endowments of their original allotment, not the result of human effort. Thus to follow one’s nature in excess is the way of branching and side growths. Yet the deluded multitude, grasping their own shortcomings to emulate others, seek what lies beyond their allotment, and persist in doing so. By agitating the nature of things, these several men take one correctness and apply it to the myriad, hence they are not the ultimate Way or correct principle of the world.

The truly correct in correcting does not lose the genuine nature of life and destiny.

**[Annotation]** When things each follow their nature, that is true correctness. From this point onward, the ultimate correctness becomes evident.

**[Subcommentary]** Using the correct principle of nature to correct the nature and destiny of the common people—hence it is called *correcting*. Things each attain their own, hence it is said they do not lose. The *nature* spoken of here is the nature of the self, and the *destiny* is also the destiny of the self—how distant is it? Thus *correcting in correcting* speaks of correcting what is not correct, and not correcting what is correct.

From this point upward clarifies the loss in distorting nature; from this point downward reveals the attainment in following nature.

Thus what is joined is not called *conjoined*;
**[Annotation]** When a branch is corrected by the main, then what is joined is called *conjoined*.

nor is what branches called *forked*.
**[Annotation]** When the main is corrected by a branch, then what branches is called *forked*.

**[Subcommentary]** When a branch is corrected by the main, what is joined is called *conjoined*, yet in truth it is not conjoined; when the main is viewed from a branch, what branches is called *forked*, yet in truth it is not forked.

What is long is not called *excessive*;
**[Annotation]** When the short is corrected by the long, then the long is called *excessive*.

nor is what is short called *insufficient*.
**[Annotation]** When the long is corrected by the short, then the short is called *insufficient*.

**[Subcommentary]** The *long* refers to Zeng, Shi, Li Kuang, Yang, and Mo—all endowed by nature with accumulated benevolence and righteousness, intelligence and disputation, surpassing the multitude, hence called *long*. Following their nature in action, they are not excessive. The *short* refers to the common people who do not match Zeng and Shi, hence called *short*; yet their natural mechanism unfolds of itself, hence they are not insufficient.

Thus the leg of a teal, though short, if lengthened causes sorrow; the leg of a crane, though long, if cut causes grief.
**[Annotation]** Each has its own correctness; one cannot use this to correct that and thereby diminish or augment it.

**[Subcommentary]** The *teal* is a small duck. The *crane* is a kind of heron. *Leg* refers to the foot. The principle of nature nurtures all forms: though their lengths differ, each body is sufficient for its function, all attaining carefree ease. Yet some would sever the crane’s long leg to lengthen the teal’s short one, deeply violating creation and losing their original nature—hence sorrow and grief. Thus what is long by nature is not to be cut, and what is short by nature is not to be lengthened; there is nothing to remove or sorrow over.

**[Annotation]** Knowing that one’s allotted nature is not to be cut or lengthened and allowing it to be, there is nothing to remove, and sorrow removes itself.

**[Subcommentary]** Endowed with nature and receiving form, each has its measure; long and short are fitting, their original allotments different. Like the teal and crane, they are not to be cut or lengthened. Thus, each guarding their allotted portion, though there is no effort to remove sorrow, sorrow removes itself.

Alas! Are benevolence and righteousness not part of human nature?
**[Annotation]** Benevolence and righteousness are indeed part of human nature and emotions, but they should simply be allowed to follow their course.

Why then are those benevolent men so full of sorrow?
**[Annotation]** Those who fear that benevolence and righteousness are not part of human nature and thus sorrow over it—truly they may be called full of sorrow.

**[Subcommentary]** *Alas* is an exclamation of sighing.

Those of benevolent and righteous disposition act from Heavenly principle, following their nature in possessing them—not through imitation or emulation. Yet the so-called benevolent men, followers of Zeng and Shi, fail to embody the true essence, arbitrarily generating exhortations and rewards, claiming the Way of benevolence and righteousness can be learned and achieved. Master Zhuang deeply lamented this delusion, hence his sigh of sorrow. For they draw things beyond their proper bounds—thus are they called "full of sorrow."

Is it not part of human nature? Indeed, it is part of human nature and emotions.

Moreover, those with conjoined toes weep when severed; those with extra fingers wail when cut. Whether in excess or deficiency of the proper number, their sorrow is the same.

**[Annotation]** Deemed deficient, they weep when excised; considered excessive, they wail when severed. How could it be otherwise? Though the myriad beings differ in kind, there is no ground for releasing sorrow. Only by each abiding in their Heaven-given nature, neither excising conjoined toes nor severing extra fingers, can they be perfectly formed without harm—what sorrow then remains?

**[Subcommentary]** *Yi* means to gnaw and sever; *ci* means to separate and divide. "Excess in number" refers to the growth of a sixth finger; "deficiency in number" refers to conjoined toes forming four. These two conditions, conjoined toes and extra fingers, arise naturally from Heaven. They should simply be left as they are, for neither is more nor less. Yet some cannot remain indifferent, stubbornly clinging to right and wrong, deeming extra fingers excessive and conjoined toes deficient, arbitrarily seeking to excise or sever them to conform to the number five. Having harmed the work of creation, they cause weeping and wailing—thus, though the methods of excision differ, their sorrow is one.

The benevolent men of this age, their eyes troubled by the world’s ills,

**[Annotation]** If the path of universal love is deemed admirable, then the world’s eyes will be thrown into chaos. To admire such a path, then lament that it has not yet brought peace, is to plunge people into peril before rescuing them—yet this is precisely what the present age calls benevolence.

**[Subcommentary]** *Hao* means eyes in turmoil. Benevolence is the advancement of universal love. "This age" refers to the degenerate era.

The followers of Zengzi and Shishu, practicing this universal love, thus lead some to imitate others in emulating them. Once the path of seeking favor is opened, the functions of ears and eyes are thrown into chaos. When ears and eyes are in chaos, calamities and difficulties arise. Thereupon, they lament the turmoil and seek to remedy it with benevolence and righteousness, unaware that the source of calamities and difficulties lies in the promotion of sagely conduct.

The unbenevolent, severing the true nature of life and its essence, covet wealth and honor.
**[Annotation]** Wealth and honor are coveted only because there are those who esteem them. If there were no promotion of what is admirable, people would rest content in their lot, measuring their strength to accept their tasks—how could they imitate others to covet and usurp what is beyond their due?

**[Subcommentary]** *Tao* means to covet wealth. Those who, by nature, do not embrace benevolence and righteousness are called the unbenevolent. Their intent lies in seeking profit and emolument, stealthily usurping wealth and honor. Thus, they sever their innate nature, lose the true essence of their allotted fate, and feign a false nature, abandoning themselves to pursue external things. This arises precisely because the promotion of sagely conduct is deemed admirable, giving rise to such abuses. From this, we know that to embrace simplicity and return to purity, one must sever benevolence and abandon righteousness. Thus, can benevolence and righteousness truly be considered the natural sentiments of humanity?

**[Subcommentary]** This further reinforces the preceding argument. Since the Three Dynasties, why has the world been so clamorous?
**[Annotation]** Benevolence and righteousness are indeed human sentiments. Yet since the Three Dynasties, people have clamorously abandoned their true nature to pursue promotion, as if they could not keep up—is this not a cause for great sorrow?

**[Subcommentary]** *Since* means from. The Three Dynasties refer to Xia, Yin, and Zhou. *Clamorous* means noisy and chaotic. Benevolence and righteousness arise from innate nature. Yet since the Three Dynasties, people have abandoned their nature to chase after external pursuits, clamorously competing—how foolish this is! Thus, the Xia practiced benevolence, the Yin practiced righteousness, and the Zhou practiced ritual—this is the very state of clamor.

Those who rely on hooks, plumb lines, compasses, and squares to set things right are carving away at their nature.
**[Subcommentary]** Hooks make things curved; plumb lines, straight. Compasses make things round; squares, square. Things rely on hooks, plumb lines, compasses, and squares to achieve curvature, straightness, roundness, and squareness—these are not their natural state. This illustrates that people who rely on teachings to practice benevolence and righteousness do not act from their true nature. To act with true spontaneity is not to rely on learning. Thus, those who feign a false nature, abandon themselves to imitate external things, and practice benevolence and righteousness are destroying and damaging their innate nature.

Those who rely on ropes, glue, and lacquer to make things firm are encroaching upon their virtue.
**[Subcommentary]** *Rely* means to bind. *Firm* means secure. *Encroaching* means to harm. *Virtue* means true wisdom. Those who rely on ropes to bind and glue and lacquer to secure are depending on external things rather than true firmness. This illustrates that those who emulate Zengzi and Shishu to practice benevolence are acting with falsity, not from their true nature. Having deviated from their original nature, they thus encroach upon their virtue.

To bend and break with ritual and music, to comply with benevolence and righteousness in order to comfort the hearts of the world, is to lose one’s constant nature.
**[Subcommentary]** *Bend* means to curve; *break*, to sever. *Comply* means to nurture and soothe. To twist the straight into the curved is to impose ritual with its nodes and patterns; to sever the long to fit the short is to practice music with its extravagance. To nurture partial love as benevolence and to comply with the path of righteousness—using these falsehoods to comfort the hearts of things—leads beings to lose their truth and people to forsake their roots. Thus, they abandon the root to chase the branches, losing their true, constant, and natural nature. This summarizes the errors of the preceding text to introduce the gains of what follows.

The world has its constant nature. That which is constant: the curved does not rely on hooks, the straight does not rely on plumb lines, the round does not rely on compasses, the square does not rely on squares, adhesion does not rely on glue and lacquer, and binding does not rely on ropes.
**[Subcommentary]** The myriad things of the world each have their constant allotment. For example, mugwort is curved and hemp is straight; heads are round and feet are square. Water congeals in winter and melts in summer; fish gather in spring and scatter in autumn. These arise from nature, not from external things—how could hooks, plumb lines, compasses, squares, glue, lacquer, or ropes be applied to them? Just as this is so for forms, so it is for nature. Thus, we know that ritual, music, benevolence, and righteousness are what disorder the warp of heaven.

**[Alternative Explanation]** *Adhesion* means to depend. Thus, the *Han History* states: "During the reign of Emperor Ai, those who depended on the Dong clan all rose to positions of two thousand bushels." The annotation explains: *Depend* means to rely upon. Thus, the world, in its natural course, gives birth to all things without knowing why they are born, and all attain their lot without knowing how they attain it.
**[Annotation]** Things have their constant nature. When left to themselves without interference, people naturally attain their lot without self-awareness.

**[Subcommentary]** As things are born, receiving qi and taking form, some are square, some round, now curved, now straight. Nurtured and poisoned, each is sufficient in its nature, yet none discerns why this is so, nor knows the reason. How could they be troubled by anxious thoughts or their hearts bound to gain and loss? Thus, to bend and comply is to lose one’s constant nature. Therefore, from ancient times to the present, there is no duality—it cannot be diminished.

**[Annotation]** Being of the same substance as things, one remains undivided and constantly whole with them.

**[Subcommentary]** Those who see beginnings and ends as not one are deluded by common sentiments. Those who perceive that from ancient times to the present there is no duality possess the illumination of sagely wisdom. Thus, though not born, they are born without knowing why; though not attaining, they attain without knowing how. Though there may be ancient times and the present, the Dao remains undiminished. Through a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, it is ever one and constant. Then why should benevolence and righteousness cling like glue and lacquer, ropes and bindings, wandering amidst the questions of the Dao and virtue?

**[Annotation]** Those who attain by following the Dao embrace simplicity and walk alone, free from the clinging of external things, acting without interference.

**[Subcommentary]** *Why* means what. *Clinging* means continuous attachment.

The Dao and virtue are neither being nor non-being, neither arising nor ceasing. They cannot be sought through sagely wisdom, nor grasped through forms and names. Yet the likes of Zengzi and Shishi, whose natures abound in benevolence, lead others by their own example, entangled in the web of names and teachings. Bound as if by ropes, fixed as if by glue and lacquer, their thoughts follow one after another in unbroken succession. Those who carry such conduct and arrogantly wander the realm of the Dao and virtue are like one who studies the square to master the round, or a fish that yearns to be a bird—vainly chasing the name of lofty aspiration while lacking any true efficacy. They forget not the fish and hare in their pursuit of the trap and snare, yet lose even the straw dogs already discarded. What value is there in this? It only serves to confuse the world.

**[Annotation]** The unbroken clinging to benevolence and righteousness is enough to delude others and cause them to lose their true nature.

**[Subcommentary]** The teachings of the Seven Virtues and the discourses of the wise deviate from the natural Way and disorder the hearts of the world. Minor delusion confuses direction; great delusion alters one’s nature.

**[Annotation]** Though east and west may be confused, the body remains unharmed. But to pride oneself on transformation and exalt righteousness is to lose one’s constant nature. To die for such causes is the greatest delusion.

**[Subcommentary]** To mistake south for north is but a small error; to be ensnared by teachings and lose one’s true nature is a far greater delusion. How do we know this is so?

**[Subcommentary]** *So* means thus. This is a rhetorical question leading to what follows.

Ever since the time of Yu’s promotion of benevolence and righteousness to govern the world, none have not rushed to answer the call of benevolence and righteousness.

**[Annotation]** One who harms nothing is not acting out of benevolence, yet transformation naturally unfolds. One who makes all principles accord is not acting out of righteousness, yet the efficacy of righteousness manifests. Thus, what is fitting and harmless is not the result of benevolence and righteousness. Yet the world rushes and races, abandoning the self to pursue externals, losing its constant nature. Therefore, the mind is not disordered by ugliness but by beauty; the world is not troubled by evil but by benevolence and righteousness. Thus, benevolence and righteousness are the very tools that disorder the world.

**[Subcommentary]** *Yu* refers to Shun. *Promotion* means adoption. *Disorder* means confusion. Before the time of Yao, people still embraced simplicity; after Shun, the pure wind gradually dissipated. Thus, the sagely discourses of the Seven Virtues were used to guide the common people, causing all under heaven to rush about in confusion, losing their nature and chasing after sagely teachings. Is this not a case of benevolence and righteousness altering one’s nature?

**[Annotation]** Though Shun had no intention of altering others, the nature of the world was already changed.

**[Subcommentary]** From this, is it not clear that the use of benevolence and sagely teachings has disordered the world, causing people to abandon the root and pursue the branch, thereby corrupting their natural nature?

Thus, let us examine the matter: from the Three Dynasties onward, none under heaven have not exchanged their nature for external things.

**[Annotation]** Before the Three Dynasties, there were indeed teachings of non-action. Yet even the promotion of non-action is something the active seek to emulate. To emulate it is to lose one’s natural simplicity. Thus, even the sage has no choice but to sometimes exchange the ease of effortless rule for the toil of hardship. How much more so for the common people?

**[Subcommentary]** Before the Five Emperors, the wind of non-action still prevailed; from the Three Dynasties onward, teachings of action gradually arose. Different ages, different customs—thus, people imitate others and abandon their true nature, chasing externals without return. Is this not lamentable? The annotation speaks of exchanging the ease of effortless rule for the toil of hardship: *hardship* refers to injury. It says that Yu endured wind and rain, his hands and feet calloused, exchanging the work of non-action for such toil. Since the ruler did so, the people followed suit.

The petty person sacrifices himself for profit; the scholar, for fame; the grandee, for his family; the sage, for the world.

**[Annotation]** The quail dwells in a nest, the crow flies without pattern—what do they惜 not to sacrifice? Thus, they remain ever in harmony with the world, adapting to whatever comes. Their path is but the course of worldly sacrifice. Yet what they encounter may sometimes involve the hardship of injury or the loss of hair. Their course is but the way of harming nature. Yet though they roam the eight extremities, their spirit and qi remain unchanged; though their hands and feet may be calloused, their embodied form is undisturbed. What, then, do they sacrifice? Nothing. Thus, they do not sacrifice what they seem to sacrifice but instead follow the world in its sacrifices.

**[Subcommentary]** *Sacrifice* means to follow, to pursue, to seek, to chase—what the self follows. The petty person chases profit; the scholar values fame; the grandee sacrifices himself for his family; the emperor pursues the world. Though what they sacrifice differs, their alteration of nature is the same. Yet the sage remains ever in harmony with the world, and his course is but sacrifice. Thus, though he may suffer injury or loss, his spirit is never burdened. Therefore, though these several types differ in their undertakings and their reputations vary, in their harm to nature and their self-sacrifice, they are one.

**[Subcommentary]** *These several types* refers to the four mentioned above. *Undertakings* refers to their differing pursuits—profit, fame, family, and the world. *Reputations* refers to the varying titles of petty person, scholar, grandee, and sage. Though these four differ in their undertakings and reputations, in their harm to life and pursuit of externals, they are no different.

Zang and Gu, the two of them, were herding sheep together and both lost their sheep.

**[Subcommentary]** This continues the previous analogy to introduce what follows. The *Mencius* says: Zang was a good learner; Gu, a young man. Yang Xiong says: *Zang* refers to a son-in-law; *Gu*, to a child of a good family. *Herding* means tending. *Lost* means to lose.

These two men, though differing in name and pursuit, both lost their sheep. When asked what Zang was doing, he was clutching bamboo slips and reading; when asked what Gu was doing, he was gambling and idling. Though their pursuits differed, in losing their sheep they were the same.

**[Subcommentary]** *What* means "why." *Slips* refers to bamboo or wooden tablets. In ancient times, without paper, all books were written on slips. *Five roads intersecting and tossing dice* is called *bo*; without tossing dice, it is called *se*. Though Zang and Gu differed—one with books, the other with dice—in herding sheep and losing them, there was no difference.

Boyi died for fame beneath Shouyang Mountain, while Robber Zhi died for profit atop Dongling Peak.

**[Subcommentary]** This continues the analogy. Boyi and Shuqi were both sons of the Lord of Guboo, descendants of Shennong of the Jiang clan. Boyi, named Yun, styled Gongxin; Shuqi, named Zheng, styled Gongyuan. Boyi was the elder but born of a concubine; Shuqi was younger but born of the wife. Their father favored Shuqi and often praised him to Boyi. When their father died, the brothers yielded the succession to each other and did not inherit the throne. Hearing that King Wen was virtuous, they went to Zhou. When King Wu campaigned against Zhou, they grasped his horse’s bridle to remonstrate. Their advice was ignored, so they fled to Shouyang Mountain, gathering ferns for food and refusing to eat grain. They starved to death on Shouyang Mountain, which lies in present-day Pu County, Shanxi. Thirty *li* south of the prefectural city, the temple and tomb of Boyi and Shuqi stand amid dense forests. Robber Zhi was the younger brother of Liuxia Hui, named Zhi, with nine thousand followers. A notorious bandit, he was named for his trade. Dongling was a mountain, also said to be Mount Tai, located in Qi Prefecture, fifteen *li* from Dongping. Zhi died there. Though their deaths differed, in harming life and injuring nature they were the same.

**[Subcommentary]** Boyi died for fame beneath Shouyang Mountain; Robber Zhi died for profit atop Dongling Peak. Though what they died for—fame or profit—differed, in harming and injuring themselves, they were no different. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong?

**[Commentary]** What the world values is life. Now, when they sacrifice it so excessively, both harm their lives. Then the rightness or wrongness of what they sacrifice is no longer worth discussing.

**[Subcommentary]** By worldly standards, there is good and bad; from the perspective of the Dao, what is right and what is wrong? Thus, Robber Zhi is not necessarily wrong, nor is Boyi uniquely right. The world is wholly given to sacrifice. Those who sacrifice for benevolence and righteousness are called *junzi* by the world; those who sacrifice for wealth and property are called *xiaoren*.

**[Subcommentary]** This summarizes the preceding to introduce what follows. The Dao has long been lost, and none act rightly. Now, in the world, all sacrifice—how could only Boyi and Zhi do so? Those who follow benevolence and righteousness never escape fame; those who chase wealth and property are fixed on profit. Only fame and profit are the roots of harming life, not the heavenly principle but arising from worldly sentiment. *Junzi* and *xiaoren* cannot be taken as reliable standards. Since their sacrifice is one, there are *junzi* and *xiaoren*; but if one considers harming life and injuring nature, then Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi. How then can one distinguish *junzi* from *xiaoren*?

**[Commentary]** The world all considers not harming life as good. Now, when all equally harm life, though what they sacrifice differs, it is no longer worth calculating. Why harm life? Why alter nature? It all stems from esteeming the path of non-action. If one knows that advancement arises from non-action and is accomplished thereby, then one will cease excessive esteem and return to the profound limit of the self.

Yao and Jie will be equal in self-contentment; how then distinguish *junzi* from *xiaoren*?

**[Subcommentary]** *How* means "why." Though their sacrifices—fame or profit—differ, producing the distinction between *junzi* and *xiaoren*, in harming life and injuring nature, there is no difference between Robber Zhi and Boyi. This is merely a worldly distinction, unrelated to the true ultimate. By what can one take *junzi*? By what can one distinguish *xiaoren*? There is no difference.

Moreover, those who bind their nature to benevolence and righteousness, though as accomplished as Zengzi and Shishi, are not what I call good.

**[Commentary]** *Bind* means to attach to that. Binding one’s nature to benevolence is merely sacrificing for benevolence, which is not good.

**[Subcommentary]** *Bind* means to attach. *Good* refers to excellence. *I* refers to Zhuangzi himself. Those who abandon themselves to imitate others, gaining things at the cost of the self, follow the false sentiments of the vulgar. Thus, to attach one’s heavenly nature to learning benevolence and righteousness, though as accomplished and near to sageliness as Mo Di or Yang Zhu, is contrary to one’s original nature and not what I call good in nurturing life.

Those who bind their nature to the five flavors, though as accomplished as Yu Er, are not what I call good.

**[Commentary]** Following one’s nature to master flavors is good.

**[Subcommentary]** The *Mencius* says: Yu Er was a man of Qi skilled in flavors. The *Shizi* says: Yu Er blended ginger and cinnamon for the ruler’s meals. Those who lack their own heavenly essence and imitate things to gain knowledge, even if as accomplished as Yu Er, are not good.

Those who bind their nature to the five sounds, though as accomplished as Music Master Kuang, are not what I call keen of hearing; those who bind their nature to the five colors, though as accomplished as Li Zhu, are not what I call clear of sight.

**[Commentary]** Not entrusting it to the self but binding it to that, though as accomplished as that, the self is already lost. Thus, to employ one’s ears and eyes freely without binding them to Li or Kuang is true keenness and clarity.

**[Subcommentary]** Li Zhu and Music Master Kuang were endowed with keen sight and hearing, following their nature to excel, not through learning. Now, to distort one’s nature and feign sentiment, abandoning the self to imitate things—though accomplished, this is not worth calling good.

What I call good is not benevolence and righteousness; it is being good in one’s own power alone.

**[Commentary]** Good in attaining the self, forgetting benevolence yet embodying benevolence.

**[Subcommentary]** *Virtue* is *attainment*. Those who penetrate the mysterious Dao do not alter their nature to follow others—how could they still cling to the straw dogs of their own past or govern with the linked huts of former kings? Thus, to know what one inherently knows, to attain what one inherently attains, and to regard this as good—is this not fitting?

What I call *good* is not what is meant by benevolence and righteousness; it is simply following the true nature of one’s life and destiny.

**[Commentary]** To call benevolence and righteousness *good* is to harm the self in pursuit of them—this is truly unbenevolent toward one’s own nature and life. If the self is not benevolent, how can it be so toward others? Therefore, to follow one’s nature and life is to be able to reach others; reaching others without burdening the self, both self and other abide in attainment—this may be called *good*.

**[Subcommentary]** Zeng Shen, Shi Yu, Yang Zhu, and Mo Di—these four practiced benevolence and righteousness, yet they did so by following their nature and yielding to their innate endowment, like branches growing paired from birth, not through learned effort. But some, ignorant of Zeng and Shi’s benevolence, claim that imitation can achieve it; hearing of Li Zhu and Music Master Kuang’s keenness, they believe such skill can be attained through diligent practice.

Does one truly comprehend the Creator’s nurturing and sustaining power? Thus Wang Bi’s commentary on the *Book of Changes* states: "Without following one’s nature in its true essence, how can one endure long in its practice?" This is precisely the meaning here.

What I call "keen hearing" does not mean hearing others, but hearing oneself alone. What I call "clear sight" does not mean seeing others, but seeing oneself alone.

**[Annotation]** To sever all ties with Li Zhu and Music Master Kuang, relying solely on one’s own hearing and sight—this is how the keen perception and clarity of all directions are preserved intact.

**[Subcommentary]** Those who yearn for Li Zhu’s vision or emulate Music Master Kuang’s acuity, straining to see what lies beyond or hear what is distant, scatter their spirit and exhaust their ears and eyes—this is mere folly, not true clarity. But if one listens only to what the ear naturally hears and sees only what the eye naturally sees, preserving one’s allotted nature and remaining unshaken by externals, then all things are perceived with perfect clarity.

To see not oneself but others, to attain not one’s own attainment but another’s—this is to gain another’s gains while losing one’s own, to follow another’s path while forsaking one’s own.

**[Annotation]** This is to abandon oneself and imitate others. Though one may mimic them perfectly, one’s own self is already lost.

**[Subcommentary]** Those who cannot see what their own eyes see but instead seek Li Zhu’s clarity, or who cannot know what their own knowledge knows but instead strive to emulate Shi Yu’s righteousness—these merely feign the attainments of others through learned pretense, not by following their nature to attain their own. Having thus falsely learned and outwardly displayed, they imitate others to please the world, laboring in deception—hence they do not follow their own path. To follow another’s path while forsaking one’s own, whether one be a thief like Zhi or a paragon like Boyi, is equally perverse and excessive.

**[Annotation]** If one takes the loss of one’s nature as perversity, then though the paths of loss may differ, the loss itself is the same.

**[Subcommentary]** *Yin* means stagnation; *pi* means deviation. To preserve one’s allotted nature and follow the true Way is upright; to pursue fame and rivalry is perverse and excessive. Thus those who abandon themselves to chase externals, opening the path of vain hope—whether in Boyi’s goodness or Zhi’s evil—are equally deviant. The repetition of "following another’s path" here serves to conclude the preceding and introduce what follows, strengthening the rhetorical flow.

I am ashamed before the Dao and virtue. Thus above, I dare not adopt the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, and below, I dare not engage in perverse and excessive actions.

**[Annotation]** Ashamed of not embodying the Dao and virtue, and acknowledging no achievement in profound return, I therefore sever all conduct, forget fame and profit, move with ease through burdens, relinquish the self, and forget others—this alone suffices.

**[Subcommentary]** The Way of emptiness and penetration, the virtue of perfect forgetting—it transcends benevolence and righteousness, beyond categories and names. Yet Master Zhuang, subtly abiding in the center, roams beyond the realm of things, his resolve and conduct free from benevolence and righteousness, his heart and actions forgetful of right and wrong. He embodies the natural absence of being, the non-action of the Dao and virtue. The reference to "above and below" distinguishes the superiority of benevolence and righteousness from the inferiority of perversity and excess. To say "I am ashamed and dare not" is an expression of humility.

Guo Xiang’s annotation speaks of "moving with ease through burdens": *congrong* means unhurried; *chuilei* means acting without intention—like the wind stirring, lifting the lightest dust.

**Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan.**

**Exegesis by Tang Dynasty Master of Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying**
*Outer Chapters, "Horse's Hooves," Ninth*

The horse’s hooves tread frost and snow; its coat wards off wind and cold. It grazes on grass when hungry, drinks from streams when thirsty, and leaps with lifted hooves—this is the horse’s true nature.

*[Annotation]*
Each steed, whether swift or slow, finds sufficiency in its own body.

*[Exegesis]*
*Yóu* 鱿 means "teeth"; *jiàn* 践, "to tread"; *yù* 御, "to shield"; *qiào* 翘, "to raise." The hooves tread frost and snow; the coat shields against wind and cold. When hungry, it grazes; when thirsty, it drinks. At ease and content in its nature, it lifts its hooves to bound and prance, following the endowment of the Creator. How could its true nature desire the bit and bridle, the tether and stable, to be tamed and kept? Moreover, the myriad beings differ in form, yet all rely on their innate allotment. When left to follow their nature, each attains freedom. Without pride or ambition, their lives remain secure. Though there be *Xī* pavilions and *Lù* halls, they are of no use.

*[Annotation]*
The horse’s true nature does not shun the saddle or despise riding; it simply harbors no longing for glory and splendor.

*[Exegesis]*
*Xī* 羲 means "to nurture," referring to the pavilions where nobles raise and guard their retinues. Alternatively, *Xī* 羲 may signify *líng* 灵, the "spirit terrace." *Lù* 路 means "grand" or "proper," denoting the great hall of the main residence. The horse’s nature delights in the open wilds; though there be lofty pavilions and grand halls, they are of no use to it. How much more so for the man of pure emptiness or the folk of unadorned simplicity, who find joy in thatched cottages and contentment in earthen windows? Even if vermilion pillars and carved rafters were offered, what would they matter to me?

Then came Bo Le, who declared, "I excel at managing horses." He branded them, trimmed them, pared their hooves, bound them with bridles and halters, and confined them with slatted stalls—of these, two or three in ten perished.

*[Annotation]*
To treat them with intent is to fail in treating them. What is called "good treatment" is in truth no treatment at all.

*[Exegesis]*
The *Liezi* states: His surname was Sūn, given name Yáng, courtesy name Bó Lè, a man of the state of Qín during the reign of Duke Mù, famed for his skill in managing horses. *Shāo* 烧 means "to sear with hot iron"; *tī* 剔, "to shear their coats"; *kè* 刻, "to pare their hooves"; *luò* 络, "to fit them with bridles." *Jī* 羁 refers to the hobble that connects the legs; *bì* 毕, the tether that restrains the front hooves. *Zào* 阜 denotes the feeding trough; *zhàn* 栈, the slatted boards placed beneath the horse’s hooves to keep them dry—what is called a "horse stall." Unable to allow the horse’s true nature free rein, he wantonly sears and trims them, violating Heaven’s principle, and many die as a result. How much more so for those who, without intent, follow things as they are—thus preserving their nature and life. But to treat them with intent is to cut short their Heaven-appointed years. He starves them, parches them, drives them to gallop, forces them to sprint, disciplines and orders them. Ahead lies the peril of ornate trappings; behind, the threat of whip and rod. Of these horses, more than half perish.

*[Annotation]*
The skilled charioteer seeks to exhaust the horse’s abilities. Yet exhausting its abilities lies in allowing it to act of its own accord. Instead, he drives it to perform beyond its capacity, and thus many cannot endure and die. If one were to employ the strengths of swift and slow horses alike, adapting to their natural pace—though they might traverse the ends of the Eight Wastes—the nature of all horses would remain intact. Yet some, upon hearing of allowing the horse’s nature free rein, assume this means abandoning it unridden. Upon hearing of the wind of non-action, they claim that inaction is superior to action. How far have they strayed, never to return! They have utterly lost the essence of Master Zhuāng’s teaching.

**[Subcommentary]**
"Root" refers to the crosspiece, meaning the furnace is adorned with precious ornaments. A whip is made with hide, while a rod is without; both are implements for driving horses. When galloping exceeds their capacity and hunger and thirst disrupt their routine, they are restrained with the crossbar and yoke, aligned with bit and bridle, and coerced with rod and whip—all to demand abilities beyond their nature. Thus, the weak and slow cannot endure, and more than half perish. The harm wrought by sagely wisdom in governing things is no different.

The potter says: "I excel at shaping clay. The round conforms to the compass, the square to the carpenter’s square."
**[Subcommentary]** *Fàn* means to mold earth. *Táo* is the potter’s wheel, also a kiln. *Shī* is clay, also earth. The potter skillfully blends water and earth to craft vessels, ensuring that round and square shapes precisely meet the compass and square.

The carpenter says: "I excel at shaping wood. The curved fits the hook, the straight aligns with the plumb line."
**[Subcommentary]** *Shé* means curved. *Shéng* is the plumb line. The carpenter, with ingenuity, skillfully works wood, so that its curves and straightness conform to hook and line.

Yet do the natures of clay and wood truly desire to meet compass, square, hook, and line?
**[Subcommentary]** The natures of earth and wood are endowed by the Creator. They do not seek curvature or straightness, nor do they yearn for square or round. Yet potters and carpenters arbitrarily judge them as good or bad.

Nevertheless, generation after generation, people praise Bo Le for his skill in training horses and potters and carpenters for their mastery of clay and wood—this is the error of those who govern the world.
**[Annotation]** The world deems those who follow nature without artifice as unskilled in governance. To bend the crooked into straightness, to grind the dull into sharpness, to wield compass and square to forcefully correct their natures until death—this is called "skillful governance." Is this not a grave error?
**[Subcommentary]** This summarizes the preceding analogy to unify the comparison. Yet the world’s foolishness and delusion regard governance as virtue and non-governance as deceit—the greatest deceit of all. My view is that those who truly govern the world well do not act thus.
**[Annotation]** To govern through non-governance—this is true governance.
**[Subcommentary]** *Rán* means "in this manner." *Zhuāngzǐ* states: My view is that those who govern the world well do not resemble the potters and carpenters of old. The principles of good governance are elaborated below.

The people possess an enduring nature: they weave to clothe themselves and till to feed themselves—this is called "shared virtue."
**[Annotation]** The people’s virtue differs in small ways but aligns in the essentials. What cannot be removed from their nature is clothing and food; what cannot be abandoned in their affairs is plowing and weaving. These are the shared foundations of the world. To uphold this Way is the perfection of non-action.
**[Subcommentary]** *Bǐ mín* refers to the common folk. It means all living beings possess a true and constant nature, unburdened by external things. *Dé* means "attainment." Following their true and constant nature, each thing is self-sufficient—hence "shared virtue." Guo Xiang says: What cannot be removed from their nature is clothing and food; what cannot be abandoned in their affairs is plowing and weaving. These are the world’s shared foundations. To uphold this Way is the perfection of non-action.

Being unified yet impartial, this is called "Heaven’s release."
**[Annotation]** Released, they naturally become one—not partial, hence called "Heaven’s release."
**[Subcommentary]** *Dǎng* means bias. *Mìng* means "to name." *Tiān* is nature. The empty and unobstructed Way nurtures all things, fostering and sustaining them without bias. If one governs with intent, it deviates from nature. To simply release and entrust them is to allow all things to fulfill themselves—hence the name "Heaven’s release."

Thus, in the age of utmost virtue, their movements are full and steady, their gazes lofty and unyielding.
**[Annotation]** This describes their self-sufficiency within, seeking nothing beyond.
**[Subcommentary]** *Tián-tián* expresses a heart filled with contentment. *Diān-diān* conveys a gaze of lofty integrity. In the era of primordial harmony and utmost virtue, minds are freed from right and wrong, actions forget self and other. Thus, guarding their true nature within, they dwell in fullness through non-action; without seeking externally, they advance in loftiness toward emptiness and tranquility.

In such times, mountains have no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges.
**[Annotation]** Without seeking undeserved gains, they remain content within their households.
**[Subcommentary]** *Qī* means paths; *suì* means roads. *Zhōu* means boats. In such an age—the era of utmost virtue—people know their proper limits, and all things are pure and simple. Without plundering or seizing, paths and roads are abandoned; without coming or going, boats and bridges fall into disuse.

The myriad things flourish, each connected to its homeland.
**[Annotation]** In their primal chaos, all things attain their nature equally. They blend indistinguishably with the world, so how could nations differ or households diverge?
**[Subcommentary]** In this primal and indistinct era, harmony is pure and tranquil. Thus, the senseless myriad things are linked, sharing the same villages; the sentient multitude are bound, sharing the same districts. How could nations differ in governance or households vary in custom?

Birds and beasts form flocks, grasses and trees grow unchecked.
**[Annotation]** Content with their nature, they harbor no desires to consume or destroy—hence all things remain whole.
**[Subcommentary]** Flying birds and running beasts are unharmed, so they gather in flocks; herbs and trees are uncut, so they flourish in abundance.

Thus, birds and beasts can be leashed and led to roam, and the nests of crows and magpies can be climbed to peer inside.
**[Annotation]** Harmless to things, all things become docile.
**[Subcommentary]** Without intent to harm, things feel no fear of humans. Thus, mountain birds and wild beasts can be leashed and led to wander; the nests of crows and magpies can be climbed to observe.

In the age of utmost virtue, humans dwell alongside birds and beasts, and their kind mingles with the myriad things. How then can one distinguish between noble and base?
**[Subcommentary]** Those who pursue external things with perverse intent are the base; those who tread the Way with upright conduct are the noble. Yet in such an age, dwelling in nests and caves, they resemble birds and beasts—how can one distinguish between them?

With mouths full and bellies drumming, they mingle with the myriad things without distinction. How then can one discern the noble? How then can one distinguish the base?

Alike in non-knowing, their virtue does not depart.
**[Annotation]** Knowing departs from the Dao to pursue goodness.
**[Subcommentary]** Devoid of discriminating minds, they are one with the principle of non-knowing. Without resorting to perilous virtue to seek conduct, they embrace the One and do not stray.

Alike in non-desiring, this is called plain simplicity.
**[Annotation]** Desire departs from nature to pursue adornment.
**[Subcommentary]** Alike in the desirelessness of their original state, things remain pure and at peace; unlike the decadence of later ages, people retain their unadorned simplicity. In plain simplicity, the people’s nature is preserved.
**[Annotation]** Free from the entanglements of knowing and desiring.
**[Subcommentary]** The reason the common people lose their nature is that they are ensnared by desire. Thus, in desirelessness and plain simplicity, their true nature remains unlost—hence it is said to be preserved. This line summarizes the beauty of the age of utmost virtue.

Yet when it comes to the sage,
**[Annotation]** The sage is the path by which the people recover their nature, not the path they follow. Here, "when it comes to the sage" means "when it comes to their advancement."
they strain and stumble in the name of benevolence, they totter and trip in the name of righteousness—and the world begins to doubt. They indulge in extravagance as joy, they pick and choose in the name of ritual—and the world begins to divide.
**[Annotation]** Once the sage’s advancement becomes manifest, benevolence and righteousness are no longer genuine, and ritual and music depart from nature, merely assuming outward forms.
If the sage gives rise to such ills, what am I to do?

**[Subcommentary]** From the above to here, the text extols the virtue of unadorned simplicity; from here onward, it censures the failings of the sage’s advancement. "When it comes to the sage" refers to those who practiced sage-like advancement from the Five Emperors onward. "Straining and stumbling" describes the exertion of effort; "tottering and tripping" conveys an air of self-importance. "Extravagance" denotes a heart given to indulgence; "picking and choosing" refers to conduct that is convoluted and constrained. As unadorned simplicity wanes, artifice arises. Tottering and tripping in the name of righteousness that is partial and judgmental, straining and stumbling in the name of benevolence that is biased and loving; indulging in extravagance that values excess and debauchery, prizing ritual that is superficial and ornate—thus the world becomes divided, the common people grow doubtful, the warp of Heaven is disrupted, and all begins here.

If plain simplicity remains unmarred, who would fashion sacrificial goblets? If white jade remains uncarved, who would shape it into ritual tablets?

A "gloss" here: "Uncarved simplicity" is a whole tree; "unmarred" means undecorated. *Shú* means "who." *Xīzūn* are wine vessels, carved with ox-heads for ancestral temple sacrifices. A *guī* is a tablet tapering upward and squared at the base; half a *guī* is called a *zhāng*. This briefly offers a parable to illustrate the governance of an age given to contention and rivalry.

When the Dao and its power remain unabandoned, who would seek benevolence and righteousness?

A "gloss" here: This draws the parable together. In the age of the Great Dao, no distinctions of right and wrong are drawn; in the time of utmost virtue, no judgments of love and hate are made. Without love, the human heart finds rest of itself; without wrong, the root of contention is forgotten. Thus the *Lao[jing]* says: "When the Great Dao is abandoned, there are benevolence and righteousness." When nature and feeling remain undivided, who would need ritual and music?

A "gloss": Ritual serves to restrain excess; music serves to harmonize the heart. If feeling does not scatter, who would need to harmonize the heart? If nature does not stray, what need is there to restrain excess? Thus we know that harmonizing the heart and restraining excess arise only when the Dao is lost.

When the five colors do not run together, who would fashion patterned embroidery? When the five notes do not clash, who would tune them to the six pitch-pipes?

A "note": All these are instances of turning simplicity into ornament, abandoning the root to exalt the branch. In their pristine whiteness, they are marred and diminished. Though the world may prize them, they are not truly prized.

A "gloss": Patterned embroidery arises from the interplay of colors; music is valued for its harmony. If each color and each note stands alone, not enhancing one another, then the pentatonic scale scatters, and no use can be made of it. This restates the parable to reinforce the earlier point.

To mar simplicity in order to craft vessels is the fault of the artisan; to destroy the Dao and its power in order to establish benevolence and righteousness is the error of the sage.

A "note": The artisan has his compass and square; the sage has his exalted progress.

A "gloss": This sums up the foregoing. The artisan, in making sacrificial vessels, mars the uncarved wood; the sage, in advancing benevolence and righteousness, destroys the Dao of non-action. The harm is the same, and the fault should be equally shared.

The horse, dwelling on land, eats grass and drinks water; when pleased, it rubs necks with its companions; when angry, it turns its back and kicks. The horse’s knowledge extends no further than this.

A "note": If one guides it by its true knowledge and rides it in its natural state, then a journey of ten thousand *li* may be accomplished, and the nature of the herd remains unspoiled.

A "gloss": *Mǐ* means "to rub" or "to yield." *Tí* means "to kick." *Yǐ* means "to stop." The emotions of creatures are endowed by Heaven; they move in accord with their nature, not through artifice. Thus, when pleased, they rub necks in yielding harmony; when angry, they turn their backs and kick. The horse’s understanding goes no further than this: eating grass, drinking water, and finding joy therein.

When a crossbar is placed upon it and a moon-shaped ornament is fitted to its forehead, the horse’s knowledge extends to defiance, twisting its neck, rearing, startling, bolting, biting the bit, and stealing the bridle.

A "gloss": The *héng* is the crossbar at the front of the carriage shaft. The *è* is the yoke around the horse’s neck. The *yuètí* is the ornament on its forehead, shaped like the crescent moon. *Jiè* means "alone." *Ní* means "to glare." *Mǐn* means "to twist." *Jǐng* means "to butt." *Màn* means "to bolt." *Guǐ* means "to deceive." *Qiè* means "to steal." The horse’s true knowledge delights only in freedom; it does not seek adornment, nor does it covet splendor. Yet when a moon-shaped ornament is placed upon it and a crossbar and yoke are fitted, its nature is thwarted, and it cannot endure the hardship. Thus deceit arises: it glares, twists its neck, butts, bolts, and resists the driver. It steals the bridle, meaning it slips its headstall; it deceives with the bit, meaning it spits out the bit. All this arises from the violation of its true nature, giving rise to a hundred forms of artifice.

Thus, that the horse’s knowledge extends to theft is the fault of Bo Le.

A "note": Horses differ in nature, yet one seeks to make uniform their use; hence some exhaust their strength and resort to deceit.

A "gloss": *Tài* means "deceit." The horse’s true knowledge suits the open wilds; when driven beyond its capacity, deceitful thoughts arise, and the fault for its cunning and thievery lies with Bo Le.

In the age of Emperor Hexu, the people dwelt without knowing what to do, wandered without knowing where to go, fed at the breast and played, patted their bellies and roamed. The people’s abilities went no further than this.

A "note": This is the people’s true ability.

A "gloss": *Zhī* means "to go." Hexu was an ancient sovereign; it is also said that he had a radiant virtue (*hè*), causing the people to follow him (*xū*), hence the name Hexu. He is said to be the Flame Emperor. In the age when the Dao was practiced, in the era of non-action, the heart was free of anxious thoughts; one dwelt in peace without striving. Moving in accord with nature, one wandered without destination. Thus, feeding at the breast and playing, they were no different from infants; patting their bellies and roaming, they were no different from children. In this age of utmost simplicity, the people’s abilities were thus.

Yet when the sages came, they bent and twisted ritual and music to correct the forms of the world, hung up benevolence and righteousness to console the hearts of the world—and the people then began to totter and trip, to favor cunning and contend for profit, unable to stop. This, too, is the fault of the sages.

A "note": Their fault lies in making progress something to be exalted.

A "gloss": They bent and twisted, practicing ritual and music to correct the body; they hung up benevolence and righteousness, causing people to aspire to them and console their hearts. Thus, people began to totter and trip in self-importance, to favor cunning and give rise to deceit, to scheme for profit and contend without cease. Alas!

The faults of the sages at the margins. *Nanhua Zhenjing Zhushu*, Scroll Eleven concludes.

Annotations by Guo Xiang of Henan

The Tang dynasty Master of Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying’s *Subcommentary*
*Outer Chapters: "My Coffer" Tenth*

When guarding against thieves who pry open chests, delve into sacks, or force open coffers, one must gather the cords, fasten the knots, secure the hasps, and fortify the locks—this is what the world calls "wisdom."

**[Subcommentary]**
*Dun* means "to open"; *kuang*, "chest"; *nang*, "sack"; *she*, "to gather"; *jian*, "to knot"; *teng*, "cord." *Jian* refers to the latch; *lei*, to the lock and key. Now, those who open chests, search sacks, or break into coffers to seize wealth are but petty thieves, not great ones. If one wishes to guard against them, what measures should be taken? The cords of chests and sacks must be gathered and knotted, the bindings tightened, and the latches and locks made fast to prevent careless concealment. This is the shallow "wisdom" of the common world. Yet when the great thief arrives, he hoists the coffer, lifts the chest, and shoulders the sack, hurrying away—only fearing that the cords, knots, latches, and locks are not secure enough. Thus, what was once called "wisdom" is nothing but provision amassed for the great thief.

**[Annotation]**
Such is the insufficiency of so-called "wisdom."

**[Subcommentary]**
Gathering cords and fastening locks are meant to guard against petty thieves. Yet when the great thief comes, he bears and lifts them away, even fearing that the bindings and latches are not firm enough. What was once a defense thus becomes the thief’s resource, proving that worldly "wisdom" cannot be relied upon. Let us then consider: Is there any so-called "wisdom" in the world that does not accumulate for the great Dao? Are there any so-called "sages" who do not serve the great thief?

**[Subcommentary]**
The great worthy who embodies the Dao speaks without fixed intent, and so, to reveal the principle of "forgetting words," he provisionally proposes this argument: The worldly, with their shallow and superficial understanding, and the sages who advance in fame—though they claim to grasp the principle—remain far from its depth. Their intent to prevent and restrain only serves to amass for the thief; though they govern the world, they become but guards for the great robber. If one insists there are exceptions, then let it be asked: Is there truly any who does not accumulate for or guard the great thief? This is to say, they invariably serve the thief’s ends. How do we know this is so?

**[Subcommentary]**
This hypothetical question clarifies the meaning.

In ancient times, the villages of the state of Qi stood in sight of one another, and the cries of cocks and dogs carried between them. The nets and snares were spread, and the plow and hoe pierced the earth, across more than two thousand *li*.

**[Subcommentary]**
Qi was the land granted to the descendants of the Grand Duke, enfeoffed at Yingqiu. By the time of Duke Huan, who nine times convened the feudal lords and once rectified the realm, the people of Qi prospered beyond all others. Thus, the crowing of cocks and barking of dogs could be heard between villages, and the rooftops of neighboring settlements stood in view of one another. Nets and snares were cast for hunting and fishing, while plows and hoes tilled the fields. The territory spanned over two thousand *li*, and in its flourishing splendor, Qi surpassed all other feudal states. *Wei* refers to the plowshare; *nou*, to the hoe. Within its four borders, wherever ancestral temples, altars of soil and grain, cities, villages, districts, and hamlets were established—was there ever a place where the models of the sages were not followed?

**[Subcommentary]**
Man cannot stand without earth, nor eat without grain; thus, the altar of soil is called *she*, and the altar of grain, *ji*. *Ji* is the chief of the five grains; *she* means "to sprout," for it is said to bring forth all things. According to the *Art of War of Sima*: six feet make a *bu*, a hundred *bu* make a *mu*, a hundred *mu* make a *fu*, three *fu* make a *wu*, three *wu* make a *jing*, and four *jing* make a village. It also states: five households make a *bi*, five *bi* make a *jian*, five *jian* make a *zu*, five *zu* make a *dang*, five *dang* make a *zhou*, and five *zhou* make a *xiang*. Zheng Xuan says: twenty-five households make a *jian*, two thousand five hundred households make a *zhou*, and twelve thousand five hundred households make a *xiang*. *He* means "to encompass"; *he* means "how." Within the four borders of Qi, in all its cities and villages, the establishment of ancestral temples and other institutions followed the models of Yao and Shun, emulating the sages to create the laws of the state. Yet Tian Chengzi, in a single day, slew the ruler of Qi and stole his state.

**[Annotation]**
To "follow the sages" is merely to imitate their traces. But traces are things already departed, not tools for responding to change. How can they be revered and clung to? Clinging to fixed models to govern the boundless is like facing the infinite with stagnation—thus, one guards the state only to have it guarded by others.

**[Subcommentary]**
Tian Chengzi was Chen Heng, a grandee of Qi and the seventh-generation descendant of Jingzhong. Initially, Jingzhong fled to Qi and was enfeoffed at Tian, hence the change of surname. In the fourteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, Chen Heng assassinated his ruler, Duke Jian of Qi, and seized territory from Anping to Langye as his own fief. His descendant, Duke Tai of Tian, later exiled Duke Kang of Qi to the coast and established himself as ruler of Qi. From Jingzhong to Duke Zhuang, nine generations held power in Qi; from King Wei of Tian to the third generation, they ruled as marquises of Qi. In total, twelve generations controlled Qi. Zhuangzi lived during the reign of King Xuan, but since King Xuan is not counted here, it is said to be twelve generations. Did he steal only the state? He also stole the sagely laws of wisdom along with it.

**[Annotation]**
Without stealing the sagely laws, he would have had no means to seize the state.

**[Subcommentary]**
What Tian Heng stole was not merely the state of Qi—he first stole sagely wisdom, thereby gaining the allegiance of the feudal lords. Thus, we know that the display of benevolence and righteousness is but the root of theft. Therefore, though Tian Chengzi bore the name of a bandit, he dwelled in the ease of Yao and Shun. Small states dared not criticize him; great states dared not punish him. For twelve generations, he held Qi.

**[Subcommentary]**
A minor state dared not condemn him; a major state could not subdue him. His descendants continued in succession, and his ancestral temples endured. For twelve generations, as explained above, he not only stole the state of Qi but also took its sagely laws of wisdom to guard his bandit’s body.

**[Annotation]**
The sagely laws are but tools for men to use; they are not infallible instruments for complete security.

**[Subcommentary]**
He raised benevolence and righteousness to steal the state and relied on sagely wisdom to preserve himself. This reiterates the preceding text to conclude its meaning.

Let us consider this: among those whom the world calls the wisest, is there any who does not accumulate for the great thief? Among those called the greatest sages, is there any who does not guard for the great thief?

**[Subcommentary]**
This restates the earlier meaning to introduce what follows.

How do we know this is so?

**[Subcommentary]**
This hypothetical question clarifies the meaning.

In ancient times, Guan Longfeng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Chang Hong was torn apart, and Wu Zixu was pulverized. Thus, though these four were virtuous, they could not escape execution.

**[Annotation]**
Tyrannical rulers could wield the authority of their position to execute worthy men without opposition—all because of the sagely laws. Without such laws, how could Jie and Zhou have maintained their thrones to spread their poison, making the world shudder?

**[Subcommentary]**
Guan Longfeng, surnamed Guan, was a worthy minister of Jie of Xia, killed by Jie. Bi Gan was a prince of the royal house, remonstrating with Zhou of Shang, who cut open his heart to examine it. Chang Hong was a worthy minister of King Ling of Zhou. The *Garden of Persuasions* states: When Jin’s Shu Xiang killed Chang Hong, Chang Hong had repeatedly appeared in Zhou, so Shu Xiang sent a letter accusing him: "You incited the army of Jin to attack Zhou, to depose the Liu clan and establish the Shan clan." The ruler, believing Liu, executed Chang Hong. *Chi* means "to tear"; it is also said to mean "to disembowel." *Mi* means "to rot" or "to shatter." Wu Zixu was executed, his corpse cast into the river to disintegrate. These four men were all loyal and virtuous, yet they could not escape execution because lawless rulers, relying on the power of their position and the authority of sagely laws, could trample loyal ministers and unleash their venom.

Thus the followers of Robber Zhi asked Guang, saying: "Does even theft have its Dao?"

[Commentary: This sets forth a question from a base sort to open the discussion.]

Guang replied: "Where could there be no Dao?"

[Commentary: This answers the preceding question.]

The Dao is nowhere absent—where could one go that is not the Dao?

Wherever the Dao resides is set forth below.

To divine the treasures hidden in a chamber is sagacity;
to enter first is courage;
to withdraw last is righteousness;
to know what may or may not be done is wisdom;
to divide spoils equally is benevolence.
Without these five, none in the world has ever become a great thief.

[Annotation: These five qualities restrain theft, yet they become the thief’s very resources.]

[Commentary: Within a chamber’s storehouse lie treasures; when a thief conceives a reckless intent, he weighs and measures, divining presence or absence with uncanny accuracy—hence sagacity. Joining strength and will, he shuns no resistance, striving to enter first—hence courage. Amidst arrows and stones, he heeds not his life, yet in retreat he yields the lead—hence righteousness. He acts when he may, desists when he must, discerning safety from peril, fortune from misfortune, ensuring victory wherever he goes—hence wisdom. Light of wealth, heavy of honor, he takes little and yields much, dividing goods with equity—hence benevolence. These five are the very sagacity, courage, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence just named. To commit a single theft requires all five virtues; without them, theft cannot succeed. Thus it is known: without sagacity and wisdom, none in the world has ever become a great thief.

From this it may be seen: the good cannot stand without the Dao of the sage, nor can the base proceed without the Dao of the sage.

[Commentary: The Dao of the sage refers to the five virtues. Reasoning thus, those who would do good cannot establish themselves or practice the Way without treading the five virtues, while the base and corrupt cannot carry out their theft without the resources of sagacity and wisdom.]

Since the good in the world are few and the ungood many, the sage’s benefit to the world is slight, while his harm to the world is great.

[Annotation: True indeed are these words. Though true, the sage cannot be done away with, for the world’s knowledge cannot be wholly extinguished; thus the Dao of the sage is needed to govern it. If all knowledge were lost save that of the sage, the world’s harm would be greater still than with the sage’s presence. Though the harm of the sage’s presence is great, it is still preferable to the chaos of his absence. Yet even this is not so good as the total absence of harm.]

How extreme it is! The world seeks nothing but profit, yet cannot wholly abandon its knowledge—how deluded and lost to the proper end!

[Commentary: Both good and evil paths arise from sagacity and wisdom. Boyi guarded his purity and won fame, while Robber Zhi indulged his greed and seized profit. Yet Robber Zhi’s kind are legion, while Boyi’s are few. Thus it is known that the sage’s advent benefits the world little and harms it much. Hence it is said: When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when Lu’s wine was thin, Deng and Ye were besieged; when the sage arises, great thieves appear.]

[Annotation: The lips’ loss does not chill the teeth, nor did Lu’s thin wine besiege Deng and Ye, nor does the sage’s rise give rise to great thieves—yet these follow one another naturally, by the force of circumstance. Though the sage does not set himself above things, he cannot prevent things from exalting him. Thus, whether noble or base, true or false, if one emulates the sage’s methods, the world swallows its voice and submits in unison—this is precisely what Jie and Zhi relied upon to become great thieves.]

[Commentary: The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: "When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold"—this refers to Yu and Guo. Deng and Ye were cities of Zhao. Once, King Xuan of Chu summoned the feudal lords; Duke Gong of Lu arrived late, and his wine was thin. The king grew angry and sought to humiliate him. The duke said: "I am a descendant of the Duke of Zhou, who practiced the rites and music of the Son of Heaven and rendered service to the Zhou house. Now I offer wine with some lapse in ritual, and you rebuke its thinness—is this not excessive?" He then departed without leave. Enraged, the king raised troops to attack Lu. King Hui of Liang, eager to attack Zhao but fearing Lu’s aid, now saw that Chu and Lu were at odds. Thus Liang besieged Deng and Ye, and Deng and Ye were besieged. This too arose from the sage’s rise—not that he wished to give rise to great thieves, but circumstances made it so.]

Strike down the sage, release the thief—and only then will the world be well-governed.

[Annotation: The sage is what the world exalts. If one were to abolish what is exalted and preserve one’s original simplicity, discard prohibitions and replace them with few desires, this would mean striking down the sage to preserve one’s own simplicity, releasing the thief to still his villainy.]

Thus the ancients said: To guard against depravity and preserve sincerity, one need not rely on keen scrutiny; to quell excess and cast off ostentation, one need not depend on harsh punishments—this is what is meant.

[Commentary: *Strike* means "to beat."]

The sage is akin to "sagely advancement." The sage, in truth, encompasses all things with wisdom and aids the world with the Dao. Yet when we speak of "striking down," this also conveys the intent to denounce benevolence and righteousness, to abolish sageliness and discard wisdom. By not prizing rare and precious goods, one may release the thief, dispense with harsh punishments, and the world will attain great peace.

When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. Once the sage is dead, great thieves will no longer arise.

[Annotation: Rivers do not empty valleys by draining them, nor do leveled hills fill abysses by depositing earth. The cessation of sageliness does not halt thievery by design.]

Thus, to halt thievery lies in eliminating desire, not in exalting sageliness and knowledge.

[Commentary: When wisdom and cunning emerge, deceit and falsehood arise; when sagely advancement perishes, great thieves cease. This is like rivers running dry and valleys emptying, hills leveling and abysses filling—how could one contrive such an outcome? It is the natural course. "Dead" means "to cease." The world is at peace and free of disturbances.

[Annotation: Not only do thieves cease, but the paths of contention and ostentation also vanish entirely.

[Commentary: "Disturbances" means affairs. With the abolition of sageliness and the rejection of wisdom, the world attains great peace, people sing as they till the soil, and there are no affairs of deliberate action.]

If the sage does not die, great thieves will not cease. To govern the world by revering the sage is to heavily profit the thief.

[Annotation: To revere the sage in governing the world is to provide the tools for tyrants like Jie to exploit. What they exploit is weighty, so the profit they gain cannot be light.

[Commentary: In an age of pure simplicity, where people are tranquil and act without contrivance, things return to their roots, and all fulfill their destinies—how could this depend on teachings and advancements to attain obscurity? Yet when sageliness and wisdom are not forgotten, great thieves arise. Though one may revere sagely laws to govern the world, this is no different from heavily profiting the thief. Why? Because the harm and poison unleashed by Xia Jie, the rapacity and cruelty of the thief Zhi—these stem from reliance on sagely advancement. Without sagely advancement, how could Xia Jie have ascended to the ninefold dignity and poisoned the black-haired people? How could the thief Zhi have amassed thousands of troops and rampaged across the land? What they relied upon was weighty, so the profit they gained was not light. From this, we may infer that the fault lies with sageliness and wisdom.

They create measuring vessels to quantify, yet thieves steal both the vessels and what they measure. They create scales and balances to weigh, yet thieves steal both the scales and what they weigh. They create tallies and seals to authenticate, yet thieves steal both the tallies and seals. They create benevolence and righteousness to rectify, yet thieves steal both benevolence and righteousness.

[Annotation: What confounds petty thieves becomes the resource and profit of great thieves.

[Commentary: A *hu* is a vessel like today’s *dou*, used to measure quantity. *Quan* is the weight, and *heng* is the beam of a scale, used to balance weight. Tallies are split into two parts, reuniting to form a whole—like today’s bronze fish or wooden contracts. Seals are the jade insignia of rulers, used to summon and command the world. Benevolence is kindness; righteousness is propriety. The ruler’s kindness extends to all, following propriety to establish norms and nurture the black-haired people. These eight are the world’s precious instruments, indispensable to one another. The sage establishes teachings to govern the state, yet Tian Cheng exploits them to steal the state of Qi—is this not harming petty thieves while profiting great ones? How do we know this is so? Those who steal a belt hook are executed, while those who steal a state become lords. Where lords reside, benevolence and righteousness abide—does this not mean they have stolen benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom?

[Commentary: The belt hook refers to a waist belt clasp. The rise of sagely teachings was originally to punish evil and encourage good. Yet those who privately steal a belt hook are executed, while those who publicly seize the state of Qi become lords. Without benevolence and righteousness, how could they lead the masses? From this, how can we not conclude that they have stolen sageliness and wisdom to rob the state? The question "How do we know this?" is hypothetical; the passage from "Those who steal..." onward provides the hypothetical answer.]

Thus, those who pursue great thieves, usurp the position of lords, and steal the benefits of benevolence, righteousness, measuring vessels, scales, tallies, and seals—even with the rewards of high rank and emolument, they cannot be encouraged; even with the threat of axes and execution, they cannot be restrained.

[Annotation: High rank and axes are the weightiest of rewards and punishments. Yet when rewards and punishments are used to restrain thieves, great thieves merely follow and steal them, turning them into tools for thievery. What they employ is weighty, and thus it enables their great thievery.]

The great thief, then, necessarily acts with benevolence and righteousness, balances with scales, authenticates with tallies and seals, encourages with high rank, and threatens with axes—stealing these public instruments before lords can be usurped. Thus, benevolence, righteousness, rewards, and punishments are merely sufficient to execute those who steal belt hooks.

[Commentary: "Pursue" means to follow; "encourage" means to urge; "restrain" means to halt. *Xuan* is a carriage; *mian* is a crown. The establishment of sagely advancement was originally to quell deceit and treachery, yet Tian Cheng exploited its methods to steal the state of Qi, seizing scales, tallies, and seals, usurping the position of lord and calmly facing south—how could he be encouraged with carriages and crowns or threatened with axes? The smaller axe is called *fu*; the larger, *yue*. Some say the axe is adorned with gold. This heavy profit for thieves renders them uncontrollable—this is the fault of the sage.

[Annotation: That they cannot be restrained arises from the weight of what they steal. That what they steal is weighty arises from the sage’s failure to diminish it. Thus, the remedy lies in devaluing goods, not in revering the sage.

[Commentary: That the thief Zhi could amass nine thousand troops and rampage across the land also relied on the Five Powers. Without sageliness and wisdom, how could this have been possible? We know that the inability to restrain those who plunder and seize people stems from the fault of the sage in creating laws.]

Thus it is said: "Fish must not leave the depths; the state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to a single soul."

Fish parted from the deep become prey for men; sharp tools displayed become resources for thieves—hence they must not be shown.

The sage is the state’s sharpest tool. Were the sage truly to renounce sageliness and forsake knowledge, returning to the hidden extremity of things—where each extremity is itself hidden—then the instrument of his advancement in service to things would be but a vessel, to be grasped and used as such.

Such sages as Yao, Shun, Wen, and Wu are not to be paraded before the world. To display sharp tools to the world is to arm its thieves and bandits.

When the sage governs, he responds to things as they arise and adapts to the times, now yielding, now wielding the shield and spear, his conduct never fixed. He cannot be rigidly grasped or openly displayed to the world. To cling to a single course is to invite ruin, as seen in the cases of Zizhi of Yan and Baigong.

Thus, when sageliness is renounced and knowledge abandoned, great thievery ceases. Remove what thieves rely upon, and their crimes halt without need for prohibition.

Shatter jade and crush pearls, and petty theft will not arise. Devalue what men treasure, and crime will fade without punishment.

Burn tallies and break seals, and the people will return to simplicity. Destroy what deceivers depend upon, and their cunning will have no means to operate.

Abandon measuring cups and smash scales, and the people will know no strife. For the small equalities are but the tools of greater inequalities.

Once the measures of quantity and weight are shattered, they can no longer be stolen and turned to thieves’ ends. To strike and break them is to align with the wisdom of the ancients, and so all contention ceases.

Exhaust and destroy the sagely laws of the world, and only then may the people be fit for discourse. When nothing remains to be falsified, the inner integrity of uncarved simplicity is preserved, and no words are lost to self-deception.

Eradicate the Three Kings, demolish the Five Emperors, and return to the utmost emptiness—where straw dogs are not arrayed, where traps and snares are forgotten, where self and things merge into obscurity. Only then may one begin to discuss the profoundest mysteries, to discourse on the far reaches of the Dao and virtue.

Confound the six pitch-pipes, melt down the zithers and se, seal the ears of Music-Master Kuang, and the world will at last hold fast to its innate hearing.

Erase patterns, scatter the five colors, glue shut the eyes of Li Zhu, and the world will at last hold fast to its innate clarity.

For sound and color, clarity and vastness—these are what those with ears and eyes esteem. Yet all beings are born with their allotted share, and if one is led astray by what they esteem, their nature and life are lost. Only by destroying what they esteem, abandoning external things to follow one’s own nature, may hearing and sight each remain whole, and each person preserve their true essence.

To pluck is to extract; to smelt is to dissolve. The *yu* resembles the sheng, with pipes arrayed within a gourd and yellow wax applied to their ends. The *se* is eight feet and one inch long, one foot and eight inches wide, with twenty-seven strings—created by Fuxi. When the ear is seduced by the five notes, it admires Music-Master Kuang’s acuity; when the eye is ensnared by dark and bright hues, it covets Li Zhu’s vision. Thus the mind and spirit race, and hearing and sight are exhausted. Yet if one tears out the pipes and severs the strings, melts down the metal and cuts the warp; if one destroys the melodies of *Huanghua* and abandons the songs of *Baixue*; if one erases the patterns of martial display and scatters the reds and purples—then one may glue shut Li Zhu’s eyes, removing the source of artificial imitation, and seal Music-Master Kuang’s ears, dispelling the leader of the disorderly throng. Only then may all people find their own way: sounds and things no longer rob me, the ear listens to its utmost and returns to hearing nothing, the eye gazes with full power and inwardly sees no color. The celestial mechanism unfolds of itself, reaching the perfection of non-action—how could there be any distinction of brightness or dimness, excellence or inferiority? Thus the world attains peace, and all things share in the same virtue. Following one’s own hearing and sight, each person preserves their innate clarity and acuity. To *preserve* is to nurture within.

Break the compass and square, snap the carpenter’s fingers, and the world will at last hold fast to its innate skill. Thus it is said: *Great skill appears clumsy.*

For even the lowly spider and mole-cricket spin webs and roll pellets without seeking instruction from craftsmen—each thing possesses its own ability. Though their abilities differ, none dares deviate from what they are accustomed to, and so what seems skillful is in fact clumsy. Therefore, one who is adept at employing others lets the square be square and the round be round, each entrusted with what they can do. People rest in their nature, and no one is burdened with the craftsmanship of the master artisan. Thus, when all skills appear mutually inept, the world naturally attains great skill. For when each relies on their own ability, compass and square may be discarded, and the master artisan’s fingers may be snapped.

The compass bends; the marking-cord straightens; the compass draws circles; the square measures angles. Gongren was a craftsman of Yao who devised the methods of compass and square—some say he was a minister of Shun. To *snap* is to break or sever. Gongren, endowed with ingenious nature, wielded compass and marking-cord, carving and shaping strange devices, creating rules and measures that led the common people of the world to blindly imitate, abandoning themselves to chase after things—all stemming from this. But if one discards compass and marking-cord, snaps the fingers and lets them act freely, then each person, following their own inner standard, will possess their own skill. It is like the spider’s web or the mole-cricket’s pellet—how could these depend on human effort? They are the workings of celestial skill. This matter is expounded in the *Lao Jing*.

Eradicate the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo, cast aside benevolence and righteousness, and the world’s virtue will at last return to primordial unity.

Remove the leaders of the disorderly throng, and the world will each revert to their uncarved simplicity, uniting in the profound virtue.

To *eradicate* is to eliminate; to *silence* is to shut; to *cast aside* is to reject. *Primordial* means origin, the Dao. Zeng Shen was the paragon of filial piety, Shi Yu of loyalty and integrity; Yang Zhu and Mo Di possessed vast eloquence by nature. These four, born with their allotted share, led the scholars of the world to imitate others, abandoning themselves—thus causing disorder and losing their original nature. Therefore, one must eliminate the conduct of loyalty and trust, silence the mouths of frivolous eloquence, reject the ostentatious benevolence of the well-ordered, and discard the grasping righteousness of the self-righteous. Then things will not lose their truth, and people will each find their own way. Following their nature and preserving principle, they merge with the profound Dao.

When people preserve their clarity, the world is not scattered; when people preserve their acuity, the world is not burdened.

To *scatter* is to dissolve; to *burden* is to be weighed down by cares. It is because one parades their acuity and clarity that cares and exhaustion gather, causing the common people to be deluded and scattered. But if one embraces acuity and clarity within and does not display them outwardly, then all things will be content and free from care.

When people preserve their knowledge, the world is not deluded; when people preserve their virtue, the world is not perverse.

If one’s knowledge remains within its proper bounds and one nurtures virtue without excess, they will naturally walk the central path of the ring, wandering within and free from delusion—how could there be any inversion or perversity?

Those such as Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Music-Master Kuang, Gongren, and Li Zhu all established their virtue externally and thereby confused the world.

These several individuals, each endowed with diverse talents, caused the world to leap forth and imitate them. In imitation, one loses oneself; when the self is lost because of another, that other becomes the source of disorder. The world’s greatest affliction lies in losing oneself.

The aforementioned individuals, all surpassing others in their allotted share, could not conceal their brilliance or hide their radiance. Instead, they stirred the waves and muddied the world, flaunting their names and establishing their virtue externally, drawing things to follow them and dazzling the multitude. The world, having lost virtue, did not return to its root—this is the origin of losing oneself.

What the law deems useless is this.

For what the law deems useful is this: sight does not exceed what is seen, and so all eyes are bright; hearing does not exceed what is heard, and so all ears are keen; skill does not exceed what one is capable of, and so all crafts are mastered; knowledge does not exceed what one knows, and so all natures are at ease; virtue does not exceed what one has attained, and so all virtues are fitting. Why establish what lies beyond the bounds of one’s nature, causing the world to race about and be unable to return to itself?

The essence of the law lies in following one’s nature in movement, for movement arises from nature—this is the marvel of the law. Yet the followers of Zeng and Shi, drawing things to themselves, not only fail to benefit the present age but even harm future generations. Though this law is established, it ultimately serves no purpose.

Do you alone not know of the age of utmost virtue? In ancient times, under the reigns of Rongcheng, Dating, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilu, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhu Rong, Fuxi, and Shennong, the people used knotted cords to keep records—sufficient merely to note what was essential. The twelve rulers above were all sovereigns of high antiquity. In those days, before the existence of historical records, the sequence of their reigns was unknown. They carved wood to make tallies and knotted cords to signify trust. Above and below lived in harmony, and human hearts were pure and simple. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says, "In high antiquity, governance was by knotted cords; later sages replaced them with written tallies."

They found their food sweet and their clothing beautiful—for what suited them was always sweet, and what fit was always fine. Had they longed for excess and extravagance, there would have been no end to dissatisfaction. They delighted in their customs and dwelled contentedly in their homes—for they kept to their allotted share, thus finding sweetness; they cast off ornament, thus finding beauty; they lived in harmony, thus delighting in their ways; they embraced tranquility, thus resting peacefully in their abodes. Neighboring states were within sight of one another, the sounds of their roosters and dogs carried between them, yet the people grew old and died without ever traveling to visit one another—for they were utterly without desire.

In such an age, perfect governance was already achieved. Without desire or seeking, embracing the Dao and holding to virtue—how could such a time not be the ultimate? Yet now, people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, "In such-and-such a place there is a worthy one," and they pack provisions to hasten toward them. They abandon their parents within and forsake their lords’ affairs without. Their footprints tread across the borders of feudal lords, and their carriage tracks crisscross a thousand *li* away. This is the very trace of perfect governance, yet it leads to such corruption.

This is the fault of those above who esteem knowledge. When rulers esteem and pursue knowledge, such excesses arise. If those above truly favor knowledge and lack the Dao, the world will fall into great chaos. As the Old Master said, "To govern the state with knowledge is the state’s ruin." How do we know this is so?

When the knowledge of bows, crossbows, snares, and cunning traps abounds, birds are thrown into chaos in the skies. When the knowledge of hooks, bait, nets, weirs, and layered traps multiplies, fish are thrown into chaos in the waters. When the knowledge of fences, snares, nets, and pitfall traps proliferates, beasts are thrown into chaos in the marshes. The more densely one attacks, the more skillfully they evade—even birds and beasts cannot be captured by knowledge, let alone humans. Thus, those who govern the world must not rely on knowledge, for relying on knowledge lacks subtlety.

When the knowledge of deceit, gradual poison, cunning, sophistry, the "hard and white" debate, the "removing filth" argument, and the "same and different" distinctions multiplies, the common folk are bewildered by eloquence. What those above value, those below cannot rest content with their own simplicity. When the simple pursue the complex, they become lost.

Deceitful schemes and poisonous influences gradually harm all things. *Hanhua* refers to cunning and treachery; "hard and white" denotes sophistry; "removing filth" signifies deceit. Such cunning knowledge and specious debates on "same and different" truly undermine true principle and offer no benefit to the world’s teachings. Thus, from afar, they may appear as mere stammering, yet the foolish multitude is misled by petty eloquence.

Therefore, whenever the world falls into great chaos, the fault lies in the love of knowledge. When all under heaven know to seek what they do not know yet do not know to seek what they already know—this is abandoning the self to imitate others, exceeding one’s proper bounds. What one knows lies within one’s nature; what one does not know lies beyond it. To seek beyond one’s nature—how is this not delusion?

When all know to condemn what they deem unworthy yet do not know to condemn what they deem worthy—this is clinging to what one approves, and from this arises contention and strife.

What the unworthy deem "unworthy" refers to the ruin wrought by Jie; what they deem "worthy" refers to the sagely way of Yao and Shun. Robber Zhi practiced unworthiness to seize Dongling, while Tian Cheng followed the sagely way to usurp the state of Qi. Thus, whether one hoards or squanders, the outcome is the same as losing sheep to divergent paths—whether one follows the ruin of Jie or the distinct path of the sages, the harm to one’s nature is equal. Yet the foolish multitude recklessly passes judgment, deeming some things worthy and others unworthy, though in truth, worthiness and unworthiness cannot be fixed. Hence arises great chaos.

Thus, above, it obscures the brightness of sun and moon; below, it melts the essence of mountains and rivers; and in between, it disrupts the seasons’ unfolding. Gasping creatures of the earth and fluttering things of the air—none fail to lose their nature. How severe is the chaos wrought by the love of knowledge upon all under heaven!

**Commentary:**
Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame arise from action. Yet the action of knowledge can truly shake heaven and earth, driving the masses before it. How, then, can those who rule over others fail to forget their knowledge?

**Subcommentary:**
This continues the preceding argument. Precisely because those above employ cunning and pursue advancement, all under heaven falls into great chaos. *Bèi* means "to disrupt"; *shuò* means "to melt"; *duò* means "to ruin." Creatures that cling to the earth are called *chuǎnyì*; those that fly in the air are called *xiāoqiáo*—both are small and insignificant. Yet clinging to the sagely way and employing knowledge brings harm so extreme that it stirs yin and yang, shakes heaven and earth, causes the sun and moon to dim, the mountains and rivers to collapse and dry up, the cycles of heat and cold to falter, and wind and rain to arrive untimely. Flying and crawling creatures, those of water and land—all lose their original nature. The poison of the love of knowledge reaches this extremity.

From the Three Dynasties onward, this has been the case: abandoning the simple and varied people to delight in the fawning flatterers, forsaking tranquil nonaction to take pleasure in the humming and hawing of self-assertion—such humming and hawing have already thrown all under heaven into chaos.

**Commentary:**
*Hēnghēng* refers to instructing others with one’s own views.

**Subcommentary:**
*From* means "beginning with." The Three Dynasties refer to Xia, Yin, and Zhou. *Zhǒngzhǒng* describes the unadorned and honest people; *yìyì* depicts the frivolous and restless. *Shì* means "to abandon"; *hēnghēng* means "to instruct others with one’s own views." In the most ancient and perfectly pure age, the pristine era, people emulated the round heavens in their clarity and emptiness, modeled the square earth in their stability and stillness, united the myriad things as one family, and lived like birds and beasts, free of knowledge. But when simplicity dissolved and cunning spread, when the Dao was forsaken and virtue abandoned, the sagely way of the Five Constants became manifest, and the Three Dynasties employed knowledge to an even greater degree. They cast aside the unadorned scholars of simplicity, cherished the frivolous flatterers, abandoned the self-contentment of desirelessness, and delighted in the meddlesome instruction of things. Having already thrown all under heaven into chaos, can this not be lamented?

The Tang dynasty Master of Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying’s Subcommentary

**Outer Chapters: "In Yu" (Chapter Eleven)**

To hear of governing the world through *yu* (letting-be) is to know it; to hear of ruling the world is not. **[Annotation]** To let beings be in their own freedom is to govern; to govern them is to bring chaos.

Man’s life is upright by nature, undisturbed by anything, so that his nature and destiny remain unexceeded, and his desires and aversions do not err. Yet those above cannot practice non-action; what those above do, the people all rush to emulate. Thus, when they are lured by admiration and desires, the people’s nature becomes licentious.

Therefore, what is demanded of a sagely king is not to prize his ability to govern, but to prize his non-action and allowing things to act of themselves. **[Subcommentary]** *Yu* means leniency; *zai* means self-so freedom. *Zhi* means control and domination. The parable says: I have heard that when the worthy and sagely entrust things to their own freedom and leniently let them be, the world is at peace. But if they establish teachings to dominate the common people, things lose their nature—like Bo Le training horses.

To *zai* (let be) is to fear that the world will become licentious in its nature; to *yu* (let alone) is to fear that the world will alter its virtue. **[Subcommentary]** Nature is the principle received at birth; virtue is the name for meritorious conduct. Thus, the words *zai* and *yu* are employed to guard against the errors of alteration and licentiousness. If one does not allow nature to be self-so, one fears things will become licentious and lose their nature. If one does not *yu* them, one fears they will imitate others and their virtue will change.

If the world does not become licentious in its nature nor alter its virtue, is there any need to govern it? **[Annotation]** Without governance, there is no alteration or licentiousness. **[Subcommentary]** When nature is upright and virtue settled, why labor to impose governance? Governance does not surpass non-governance; action does not surpass non-action.

In ancient times, when Yao governed the world, he made the world joyful, and people delighted in their nature—yet this was not tranquility. When Jie governed the world, he made the world weary, and people suffered in their nature—yet this was not contentment. **[Annotation]** Though Yao let the world be in freedom, his advancement was governance. Though governance and chaos differ, both lose the tranquility and joy of later generations, causing things to vie for esteem, fear degradation, and fail to attain self-contentment—this is the same. Thus, praising Yao and blaming Jie is not as good as forgetting both. **[Subcommentary]** *Tian* means stillness; *yu* means joy; *cui* means sorrow. Yao ruled with virtue, and people sang and played *ji zhang*, yet this violated their tranquil nature. Jie harmed things, and beings suffered sorrow, violating their joyful nature. Though Yao and Jie’s governance differed, their causing things to lose their nature was the same.

That which is not tranquil and not content is not virtue. And that which is not virtue—can it endure long? The world has none such. **[Annotation]** Only self-contentment in tranquility and joy can endure long. **[Subcommentary]** Yao, by failing to be tranquil, disturbed people; Jie, by failing to bring joy, oppressed beings. Neither accorded with the pure harmony of nature. If one seeks to endure long, the world has never known such a thing.

Is great joy not excessive? It aids the yang. Is great anger not excessive? It aids the yin. When yin and yang are both aided, the four seasons fail to arrive, the harmony of cold and heat is not achieved—does this not injure man’s form? It causes people’s joy and anger to lose their proper place, their dwellings to lack constancy. **[Subcommentary]** *Pi* means to assist. Joy arises from the *hun*; anger from the *po*. Man receives yin and yang, sharing the same qi as the Two Modes. Yao made the hundred clans joyful, aiding the yang’s warmth and expansion; Jie made people angry, assisting the yin’s severity and contraction. When people’s joy and anger exceed their bounds, heaven loses its constancy—midsummer lacks heat, deep winter lacks frost. Having lost harmonious qi and suffered celestial disasters, people fall ill—does this not injure their forms? One must not act or establish laws, lest harm result.

When thoughts and deliberations fail to attain self-contentment, the Way is not fully realized mid-course. **[Annotation]** These are all like Yao and Jie, causing things’ joy and anger to exceed bounds, extinguishing them through governance. Man, within heaven and earth, is most capable of using his numinous awareness to disturb the myriad beings with joy and anger, agitating yin and yang.

Thus, between gain and loss, joy and anger gather in the hearts of the hundred clans, the harmony of cold and heat is ruined, the seasons’ rhythms are disrupted, the hundred measures fall into confusion, and the myriad affairs wither and perish. **[Subcommentary]** Being mired in joy and anger, the hundred clans’ plans and deliberations lose their truth, violating the laws of proper order—this is ruin indeed.

Thereupon, the world first became cunning, demanding, arrogant, and fierce, and afterward there arose the conduct of thieves, Zeng, and Shi. Thus, to reward the good throughout the world is insufficient, **[Annotation]** Admiring rewards makes one good, so rewards cannot suffice. to punish the evil throughout the world is inadequate, **[Annotation]** Fearing punishment makes one stop, so punishments cannot prevail. **[Subcommentary]** *Qiao* means deceit; *qing* means reproach; *zhuo* means solitary; *jing* means fierce. Thus, deceit, reproach, solitary arrogance, and fierce domination of others—beginning with Yao, followed by the evil of thieves and the goodness of Zeng and Shi—once good and evil became manifest, rewards and punishments were tied to them. Admiring rewards, people act good; fearing punishments, they cease evil. Yet even if the world’s axes and blades were used to punish evil, and the cosmos’ treasuries emptied to reward good, it would still be insufficient. *Ji* means sufficiency.

If one forgets rewards and punishments, allowing authenticity to prevail, then it is sufficient. **[Subcommentary]** From the Three Dynasties onward, they clamored endlessly, making rewards and punishments their sole concern. When would they have leisure to settle the feelings of their nature and destiny? **[Annotation]** Forgetting rewards and punishments to be naturally good—only then are nature and destiny fully sufficient.

Rewards and punishments are what the sagely kings used to address merit and fault, not to manifest encouragement and fear. Thus, when principle reaches its utmost, they are abandoned, and only then can unity be restored. Yet from the Three Dynasties onward, they have pursued these affairs in escape, thus clamoring and competing for advancement, making what they entrust their sole concern. When would the feelings of nature and destiny have leisure to be at peace?

**[Subcommentary]** "Clamorous" denotes the clamor of a crowd, the meaning of competing and chasing. People fear the executioner’s axe and admire the rewards of official caps and carriages. Their hearts harbor a hundred anxieties, their affairs branch into ten thousand ends, clamoring and competing without cease. Since the Xia and Yin dynasties, this trend has gradually fanned into flame—rewards and punishments entangle and disturb, leaving no respite throughout the day. How could there be leisure to settle the feelings of nature and destiny?

Moreover, do they delight in clarity? This is indulgence in form. Do they delight in keen hearing? This is indulgence in sound. **[Subcommentary]** "Delight" means to be stained. "Indulgence" means to be mired. Yearning for Li [Li Zhu] and admiring Kuang [Shi Kuang] is to be mired in sound and form.

Do they delight in benevolence? This is disorder in virtue. Do they delight in righteousness? This is perversion of principle. **[Subcommentary]** Virtue knows no partiality; partial love thus disorders virtue. Principle admits no right or wrong; imposing wrong thus violates principle. "Perversion" means opposition.

Do they delight in ritual? This is mutual assistance in artifice. Do they delight in music? This is mutual assistance in indulgence. **[Subcommentary]** Ritual involves bowing and scraping, regulated flourishes and restraints. Music encompasses the *Xianchi* and *Daxia*, the twelve pitches and eight timbres. Delighting in ritual thus aids ostentatious skill; loving music further abets lewd tones.

Do they delight in sageliness? This is mutual assistance in art. Do they delight in wisdom? This is mutual assistance in blemish. **[Annotation]** When principle is rightly aligned, there is no delight; delight in these leads to the calamity of indulgence and perversion. "Mutual assistance" means to aid.

**[Subcommentary]** Delighting in sageliness aids the proliferation of worldly arts; loving cunning exacerbates the blemishes of right and wrong.

If the world seeks to settle the feelings of nature and destiny, these eight may exist or vanish—it matters not. **[Annotation]** Whether they exist or vanish is of no consequence; abiding by one’s allotted portion settles nature and destiny. **[Subcommentary]** The eight are keen hearing, clarity, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, sageliness, and wisdom. People’s endowments differ, their natures and feelings vary. Those like Li Zhu and Shi Kuang, who possess these by original endowment, may retain them; the multitude, whose natures lack them, vainly emulate and stray from their true selves—letting them vanish is fitting.

If the world does not seek to settle the feelings of nature and destiny, these eight become like the cramped coils of southern barbarians or the hasty flurry of rustics, throwing the world into chaos. **[Annotation]** Clinging to these eight prevents the free unfolding of spontaneity, hence the cramped coils and hasty flurry. **[Subcommentary]** "Cramped coils" describes a constrained, unrelaxed demeanor. "Hasty flurry" depicts a frantic, hurried appearance. The multitudes of the world, knowing only what lies beyond their nature, fail to abide in tranquility. Confined to narrow lanes, they boast of worldly affairs, rushing about in haste, competing and chasing—all because they do not forget these eight.

Yet the world begins to revere and cherish them. How deeply deluded the world has become! **[Annotation]** Failing to relinquish them is already an error, yet they further exalt them as treasures—how could this not be profound delusion? **[Subcommentary]** The preceding eight disrupt the warp of heaven; failing to forget them is already grave delusion. To then revere them as models, clinging to them so dearly—how far this strays from simply correcting the error and moving on!

Thus, with fasting and purification, they speak of them; kneeling and seated, they present them; with drums and songs, they consecrate them—what am I to make of this?

**[Annotation]** It is not merely a matter of passing them by in passing; rather, they treasure and revere them to such an extent.

**[Subcommentary]** The meaning of these eight principles is like that of straw dogs: once past, they ought not be taken up again. Yet they observe precepts, perform rites of purification, speak solemnly of them with reverence, kneel and sit in formal audience, offer them to one another in turn, strike up the *Nine Shao* songs, and dance the *Great Zhang* melodies. They cherish and honor them, returning to their chambers with such devotion—even Zhuangzi himself would strike his breast in helplessness. Therefore, when the noble person cannot but oversee the world, there is nothing better than non-action. Only through non-action can the natural dispositions of life and destiny be preserved in tranquility.

**[Annotation]** Non-action does not mean clasping the hands in silence; it means allowing each to follow its own course, so that life and destiny are at peace. "Cannot but" does not mean being coerced by authority or punishment; it means embracing the Dao and holding to simplicity, entrusting oneself to the ultimate spontaneity of things, whereupon the world naturally submits.

**[Subcommentary]** The noble person is the sage. When he cannot but oversee the world, he is pained to act without acting. Though he acts without acting, this is not mere silence or stillness; in movement and quiescence alike, he is without intent, yet the natural dispositions of life and destiny remain ever at peace. Thus, one who values his person above governing the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes his person in governing the world may be charged with the world.

**[Annotation]** If one轻身轻身轻身轻身 to pursue profit, abandoning the self to follow things, then the person cannot even be at peace—how then can the world be governed?

**[Subcommentary]** One who values the person and scorns profit, who keeps the self within and things without, who preserves and cherishes the spirit without dissipating it in the world—such a one may be entrusted to sit above the myriad things and transform the world. Therefore, if the noble person can refrain from unraveling the five viscera or flaunting his keen perception—

**[Annotation]** To unravel or flaunt is to cause harm.

**[Subcommentary]** The five viscera are the abode of essence and spirit; keen perception is the function of the ears and eyes. If one dissects the emotions and consciousness of the five viscera and displays the functions of keen perception, then the spirit races within, and the ears and eyes are exhausted without. Abiding like a corpse yet manifesting like a dragon, silent as an abyss yet resounding like thunder—

**[Annotation]** In going out and staying in, in silence and speech, one is ever without intent, entrusting all to spontaneity.

**[Subcommentary]** The sage is as still as a corpse in quiescence, yet as dynamic as a soaring dragon in movement. Is there any difference between quiescence and movement, principle and teaching? Thus, in quiescence there is movement—abiding like a corpse yet manifesting like a dragon; silent as an abyss yet resounding like thunder. This illustrates that quiescence and movement, principle and teaching, are neither one nor different. The spirit moves, and heaven follows—

**[Annotation]** The spirit moves in accord with things; heaven acts in accord with principle.

**[Subcommentary]** The spirit is that by which the myriad things are wondrously spoken of—it is both movement and quiescence, its power equal to the azure sky, following and submitting to the arising of things. At ease and without action, the myriad things pile up like dust.

**[Annotation]** Like motes of dust moving of themselves.

**[Subcommentary]** *Lei* means dust. At ease and self-possessed, without action and in emptiness, like the wind stirring fine dust or floating objects in the clear void, like the drifting yang qi, going and staying as they naturally must—what leisure do I have to govern the world?

**[Annotation]** Simply entrusting all to its natural course.

**[Subcommentary]** Things and self blend indistinguishably, all in accord with spontaneity—why labor or take leisure to impose governance?

Cui Qu asked Lao Cong, "If one does not govern the world, how can the human heart be settled?"
Lao Cong replied, "Take care not to constrain the human heart."

**[Annotation]** To constrain it is to harm its innate goodness.

**[Subcommentary]** Cui, by surname; Qu, by given name—his origins are unknown. He asked: If one leaves the human heart to its own devices without governing it, how can it tread the path of goodness? The answer: To leave it be and let it go is to allow it to accord with principle; to impose laws and regulate things is to constrain and disturb the human heart. As the text below says: The human heart pushes downward and advances upward—

**[Annotation]** To push it downward is to make it sink; to advance it upward is to make it rise—this shows how easily it is swayed.

**[Subcommentary]** The human heart pushes others down to be below and advances itself to be above—this is the common tendency. Above and below, imprisoned and slain—

**[Annotation]** Only when there is no pushing or advancing can it be secure.

**[Subcommentary]** Sinking the heart in the struggle between above and below, it is led by circumstances like a prisoner in bonds, wearied and distressed by vexations. Deep and yielding, pliant yet strong—

**[Annotation]** If one can be pure and yielding, then the strong will become pliant.

**[Subcommentary]** Deep and yielding mean soft and weak. By tempering the emotions and acting with softness and weakness, one seeks to subdue and master the strong. Carved and chiseled, its heat scorches like fire, its cold congeals like ice—

**[Annotation]** The heat of a burning fire and the cold of congealed ice both arise from the accumulation of joy and anger. If one neither carves nor chisels, preserving one’s natural simplicity, then how can there be such extremes of ice and fire?

**[Subcommentary]** *Lian* means to strive; *ju* means to wound. To carve and chisel one’s reputation and conduct, seeking to be ahead of others—if one acts contrary to the emotions and stirs up anger, the cold becomes as severe as congealed ice; if one follows the heart and generates joy, the heat is like a scorching fire. Its swiftness is such that in the time it takes to glance up and down, it has twice caressed the lands beyond the four seas.

**[Annotation]** It is moved by customs and habits.

The heart that chases external realms—
in a single thought’s instant, it has already traversed the ten directions.
How much more, then, in the time it takes to glance up and down,
would it not twice over face the four seas?

Its dwelling is deep and still as an abyss;
its movement, suspended, leaps to the heavens.
**[Annotation]** Stillness may be made as profound as an abyss;
movement then hangs from the sky in exultant bounds.

**[Subcommentary]** The heart of desire has no fixed standard for departure.
By chance it grows still, like flowing water encountering a deep pool;
provoked by external realms, it stirs like the high heavens suspended above.
If left unchecked in its motion, it binds itself to the sky in ceaseless leaps.
That which swells in pride and cannot be restrained—
is it not the human heart alone?

**[Annotation]** The transformations of the human heart know no bounds.
If left to follow its course, it grows still and naturally penetrates all;
if governed and restrained, it crouches in frustration and pride.
Pride is an impulse that cannot be curbed.

**[Subcommentary]** Driving down and thrusting up,
beauty and ugliness, joy and anger,
bursting forth in arrogance and self-importance—
that which cannot be restrained lies in the human heart alone.

Formerly, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to carve the human heart.
**[Annotation]** The Yellow Emperor did not act for benevolence and righteousness;
he simply merged with things, and the manifestations of the seven virtues naturally appeared.
Once they appeared, later generations’ hearts then pursued them of their own accord—
this was also the Yellow Emperor’s way of leading things to carve themselves.

**[Subcommentary]** The Yellow Emperor established standards according to what was fitting,
cherishing and nurturing the people—
truly different from the partial emphasis of the seven virtues,
the restrictive measures of righteousness.
Later rulers followed his tracks,
and the common people named him a sage.
The carving of the human heart began from this.

The fault arose with later kings; the blame does not lie with the Yellow Emperor.
Yao and Shun thus wore their thighs lean and their shins bare,
exhausting their forms to nourish the world,
tormenting their five viscera to enact benevolence and righteousness,
straining their blood and qi to model laws and standards.
Yet even so, they could not fully prevail.
**[Subcommentary]** *Gong* refers to the white flesh of the thigh.
Yao and Shun followed the Yellow Emperor’s path,
their hearts and forms emaciated,
their thighs lean without white flesh,
their shins bare of fine hair.
They nourished the world’s forms,
settled the natures and dispositions of all things,
tormented their five viscera within,
strained their blood and qi without,
practicing benevolence and righteousness as their compass,
establishing laws and standards as their model—
yet still they could not avoid banishing the violent clans, for there were those they could not overcome.
Thus Yao banished Gun to Mount Chong,
exiled the Three Miao to Sanwei,
and sent Gonggong to Youdu—
these were his failures to overcome the world.

**[Subcommentary]** Formerly, the Lord of the Grand Ancestor had an unworthy son,
whom the world called Chaos—this was Gun.
He conspired with Gonggong and was exiled to the southern wilds.
The Lord of Red Cloud had an unworthy son,
whom the world called the Glutton—this was the Three Miao.
He was a vassal of Yao, enfeoffed in the land of the Three Miao,
which lay to the left of Dongting and the right of Poyang,
in Yuzhang, near the Southern Mountains.
Sanwei is a mountain name, in the western wilds—
this is the region of the Qiang in Qinzhou.
The Lord of Lesser Brilliance had an unworthy son,
whom the world called the Strange Beast—this was Gonggong.
He served as Yao’s minister of waterworks.
Youdu lies in the north—this is the land of Youzhou.
The *Book of Documents* records the execution of Gun;
this text is more comprehensive.
All four harbored malice and refused to follow Yao’s transformation,
so he banished them to the four frontiers—
this was Yao’s failure to overcome the world.
That the Four Fiends are attributed to Shun, while here they are called Yao’s,
is because at that time Shun was acting as regent for Yao.

Thus, extending to the Three Kings, the world was thrown into great alarm.
**[Annotation]** The names of Yao and Shun as emperors and kings
are merely their manifestations;
I dwell in this path, but the manifestations are not mine.
Thus, those who are alarmed belong to the world itself.
The more the world is alarmed, the coarser its edges become.
Coarseness and subtlety are but the levelness or ruggedness of the path itself—
does the traveler ever change his feet?

Therefore, the sage is one,
yet there are differences among Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu.
These differences are but the names of their times;
they are not sufficient to name the sage’s true reality.
Thus, Yao and Shun—
were they merely one Yao and one Shun?
Therefore, though they bore the appearance of strain and sorrow,
the path of benevolence and righteousness,
the means by which they traversed it remained whole.

**[Subcommentary]** *Shi* means to extend.
From the Yellow Emperor to Yao and Shun,
the sagely path stagnated and the world grew chaotic.
Extending to the Three Kings, the alarm only deepened.
Below were Jie and Robber Zhi,
**[Subcommentary]** Jie embodied the conduct of petty men below;
Zeng and Shi embodied the conduct of gentlemen above.
above were Zeng and Shi,
and the Confucians and Mohists all arose.
**[Subcommentary]** The Confucians and Mohists held fast to their doctrines,
and disputes over right and wrong arose from them.
Thus, joy and anger suspected each other,
**[Subcommentary]** What one rejoiced in, the other condemned;
they grew mutually suspicious.
the foolish and the wise deceived each other,
**[Subcommentary]** They adorned their wisdom to startle the foolish,
each deceiving the other.
good and bad denounced each other,
**[Subcommentary]** Good and not-good,
each side denounced the other.
falsehood and truth mocked each other,
**[Subcommentary]** The false mocked the true,
and the true mocked the false.
and the world declined.
**[Annotation]** None could equal the self-sufficiency of the natural.
**[Subcommentary]** They endlessly entangled and confused one another,
and the cosmos declined.
Great virtue diverged,
and the natural mandate scattered and dissolved.
**[Annotation]** They established minor differences and did not stop at division.
**[Subcommentary]** Joy and anger, right and wrong,
blazed forth in great profusion,
and thus the natural lifespan was cut short,
the natural mandate scattered and dissolved.
*Lanman* means to disperse and disorder.
The world delighted in knowledge,
and the common people exhausted themselves in pursuit.
**[Annotation]** Knowledge is without limit, and they delighted in it—
thus, there was nothing to satisfy their pursuit.
**[Subcommentary]** The sages exhausted limitless knowledge,
and how could the common people not be exhausted in pursuit?

Thus, the adze and saw were applied,
the inked cord struck,
the mallet and chisel forced into service.
**[Annotation]** They carved and chiseled their natures and destinies,
and it came to this.
**[Subcommentary]** The inked cord straightens the crookedness of wood;
rites and ceremonies show the gradations of human conduct.
The mallet and chisel bore holes in wood...

Punishments and laws sever men’s bodies and heads. Craftsmen wield axes and saws to mutilate wood; sages employ rites and laws to harm the Dao. The world reels in chaos, the fault lying in the corruption of human hearts. Thus, the worthy conceal themselves in the ravines and crags of great mountains, while lords of ten thousand chariots tremble with dread in their ancestral halls.

**[Annotation]** If one were to follow nature and dwell in what is fitting, then the worthy and the foolish would each follow their true feelings, the noble and the base would each tread their proper stations, and ruler and subject, high and low, would all attain their ultimate state—so that the world would know no strife.

Yet this discourse has so transformed the hearts of the world that they race headlong without cease. Thus, those of middling wisdom and below all adorn their natures outwardly to dazzle the multitude, hating the upright and reviling the just, drawing followers in throngs. Thereby, those who uphold authenticity lose their foothold, while those who exalt falsity usurp their authority. Thus, rulers are beset by cares above, and the people are oppressed below.

**[Subcommentary]** *Jiji* means trampling one another. Some say it means chaos—cosmic chaos, the fault of sagely wisdom. The Way of the noble man recedes, and he retreats into the hidden depths of forests and marshes. Though the lord remains in his ancestral hall, his heart quakes with dread, for lacking worthy counselors, he fears the collapse of his state.

In this age, those condemned to death lie heaped upon one another; those in cangues and stocks jostle in crowds; and those subjected to punishment and execution stand in unbroken ranks.

**[Subcommentary]** *Shu* means those sentenced to certain death. *Hengyang* refers to fetters—devices that bind the feet and neck, all called *hengyang*. From the time of the Six States to the declining Zhou, the advance of sagely governance led to the proliferation of the five mutilating punishments, so that those in cangues filled the streets, the condemned lay heaped together, and the maimed and crippled lined the roads. "Heaped" and "in unbroken ranks" make clear their multitude. Yet the Confucians and Mohists now begin to brandish their arms in the very midst of the stocks and gallows.

Alas! How extreme is their shamelessness, how utterly devoid of conscience!

**[Annotation]** This calamity stems from the pedantry of decayed scholars clinging to their doctrines. They never consider casting aside their crooked paths to return to the One, yet here they are, brandishing their arms and striving to govern those very paths—truly, their shamelessness and lack of conscience are extreme.

**[Subcommentary]** *Líbá* describes the exertion of force. The implements of the sage’s reign are meant to harm, yet the Confucians and Mohists now strain with all their might amid the stocks and gallows, clinging to their doctrines of advancement and sealed teachings, seeking to remedy the ills of the age. How could such chaos ever end? Thus, the sigh of lament arises, grieving their stubborn ignorance without cease—so conscience-stricken, yet never ashamed.

I know not whether the wisdom of the sages does not serve as the very joints that fasten the cangue, or whether benevolence and righteousness do not act as the chisel that carves the gallows’ handle.

**[Annotation]** The cangue’s frame is bound with overlapping boards as its mechanism, while the gallows’ crossbeam is fitted with a carved peg for use. The wisdom of sages and the virtues of benevolence and righteousness are far removed from the path of guilt. Yet when people esteem them, arrogance and deceit arise; and where arrogance and deceit flourish, the tools to suppress treachery are never lacking. Thus, to discard what is esteemed is to end deceit; when deceit ceases, the cangue and gallows fall into disuse—what need then for carved handles or overlapping boards?

**[Subcommentary]** *Jiēxié* refers to the wedges of restraints. *Záo* means a hole; to insert an object into a hole is called *bǐng* (a handle). Shackles without wedges are insecure; a crossbeam without holes is useless. Just as governance cannot stand without sagely advancement, nor tyranny prevail without benevolence and righteousness, so sagely advancement is the root of disorder, and benevolence and righteousness the foundation of harm. How can we know that Zeng [Can] and Shi [Qiu] do not serve as the sharp arrows of Jie’s tyranny?

**[Annotation]** *Cuìshǐ* are the fiercest arrows—here, they signify that Zeng and Shi are but tools of Jie’s cruelty.

**[Subcommentary]** *Cuì* refers to the piercing sound of an arrowhead with a hole. Sagely wisdom is the instrument of usurping the state; benevolence and righteousness are the resources of violence. Zeng and Shi become the sharp arrows wielded by Jie’s tyranny—hence the claim.

Thus it is said: "Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the world will be greatly ordered."

**[Annotation]** Follow the principle of their disorder.

**[Subcommentary]** Cast aside the instruments of usurpation, reject the resources of violence, and the realm will be at peace—this is what is meant by "great order."

The Yellow Emperor ruled as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, and his commands prevailed throughout the world.

**[Subcommentary]** His virtuous transformation and edicts spread universally.

Having heard that Master Guangcheng dwelt upon Mount Kongtong, he went to seek him out.

**[Subcommentary]** Mount Kongtong lies on the northern frontier of Liangzhou. Guangcheng is another name for Laozi.

He said: "I have heard that you, Master, have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask: what is the essence of the utmost Dao? I wish to gather the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the Five Grains and nourish the people."

**[Subcommentary]** The Five Grains are millet, panicled millet, beans, hemp, and wheat. He desired to draw upon the subtle and obscure principles of Heaven and Earth, the essential qi of yin and yang, to assist the growth of the Five Grains and nourish all living beings.

"I further wish to regulate yin and yang to nurture the flourishing of life. How may this be done?"

**[Subcommentary]** *Sui* means "to follow." He wished to emulate yin and yang by establishing offices and dividing duties, thereby following the nature of living things, and so he asked how this might be accomplished.

Master Guangcheng replied: "What you wish to ask concerns the substance of things."

**[Annotation]** To ask about the essence of the utmost Dao may indeed be called "substance."

**[Subcommentary]** *Er* means "you." To desire to sow and cultivate the Five Grains and to establish offices for the Two Modes—your questions are shallow, no more than matters of form and substance, deviating from the profound and mysterious subtlety. This is truly reproachable.

"What you wish to regulate is the ruin of things."

**[Annotation]** To impose regulation upon what is naturally so is to ruin it.

**[Subcommentary]** If you insist on establishing offices and dividing duties, compelling things to follow your will, you will deviate from the workings of creation and inevitably bring about harm and ruin.

"Since you have governed the world, clouds have not gathered before raining, and plants have not waited to yellow before falling. The light of the sun and moon has grown ever more dim."

**[Subcommentary]** *Zu* means "to gather." To appoint officials to manage yin and yang and to govern all things with intent is to invite calamity. Winds and rains will not be harmonized, heat and cold will lose their proper seasons; clouds will not gather before rain falls, and trees will shed their leaves while still green. Eclipses will press upon the Three Luminaries, dimming their light; the human heart will be disturbed, and celestial signs will grow faint and sluggish.

"As for the heart of a flatterer, ever eager to meddle—how could it be worthy to speak of the utmost Dao?"

**[Subcommentary]** "Myriad myriad" describes a narrow and inferior appearance. You are a flattering and deceitful person—how could your heart, so cramped and base, be capable of discoursing on the utmost Dao?

The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread white cogon grass for his seat, and dwelt in seclusion for three months before returning to seek him again.

**[Subcommentary]** The Yellow Emperor withdrew, purifying his mind and unifying his intent. Though he held the honored position of the Nine-Five, he built a solitary chamber to escape clamor, spread white cogon grass to keep his counsel pure, and remained in quietude for a season before journeying once more to request the Dao. *Yao* means "to visit." Broadly Accomplished Master lay with his head to the south, facing outward, while the Yellow Emperor descended to the lower wind, advancing on his knees. Twice he bowed, touching his forehead to the ground, and inquired: "I have heard that you, Master, have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask: how should one govern the body so as to attain longevity?"

Broadly Accomplished Master rose abruptly and said: "Excellent indeed is your question!"

**[Annotation]** If all people cultivated themselves and did not govern the world, the world would be well-governed—thus he praised it.

**[Subcommentary]** To set people to ordering things only invites entanglement and vexation; if each governs their own body, the world will be clear and upright—thus he praised it. *Jué rán* means "to rise swiftly." "Come!"

I shall tell you the utmost Dao. The essence of the utmost Dao is profound and obscure; the ultimate of the utmost Dao is dark and silent.

**[Annotation]** *Profound and obscure, dark and silent*—all denote absolute nothingness. Why do Zhuangzi and Laozi so often speak of "nothing"? To clarify that what gives birth to things is no-thing, and things arise of themselves. They arise of themselves—not for the sake of arising—so how could there be any further action upon what has already arisen?

**[Subcommentary]** The essence of the utmost Dao is so subtle that the mind cannot fathom it; thus it is likened to the profound and deep, the dark and abstruse. Without seeing, yet seeing of itself; without hearing, yet hearing of itself—then the spirit remains undisturbed and the form does not stray.

Guard your spirit in stillness, and your form will naturally align. Be still, be pure; do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence—only then can you attain longevity.

**[Annotation]** Let it move of itself, and thus it remains tranquil without premature decay.

**[Subcommentary]** Purify the spirit and still the thoughts; let the body rest without toil. Unmoved by external phenomena, the essence remains serene. With the mind at ease and the form relaxed, one attains long life and enduring vision.

Eyes seeing nothing, ears hearing nothing, the mind knowing nothing—then your spirit will guard your form, and your form will attain long life.

**[Annotation]** This is all movement in accord with one’s nature, hence long life.

**[Subcommentary]** Though seeing and hearing occur, nothing is perceived; with roots and dust emptied, the mind too becomes still. Illuminating without cognition, responding with constant tranquility—the spirit, unagitated, guards the form, enabling long life and enduring vision.

Be cautious within.

**[Annotation]** Preserve your true nature.

**[Subcommentary]** Forget the mind to preserve the true.

Be vigilant without.

**[Annotation]** Keep to your proper place.

**[Subcommentary]** Cut off seeing and hearing to keep to your place.

Excessive knowledge leads to ruin.

**[Annotation]** Knowledge has no bounds, hence ruin.

**[Subcommentary]** Without caution in wisdom and thought, the spirit becomes exhausted, the ears and eyes depleted by externals—how could this not lead to ruin?

I have led you to the great brightness above, to the source of utmost yang; I have guided you into the gate of profound obscurity, to the source of utmost yin.

**[Annotation]** To reach the source of yin and yang is to ascend to the great brightness above and enter the gate of profound obscurity.

**[Subcommentary]** Yang is movement; yin is stillness. *Led you*—means to emerge. When the perfected one responds to movement, wisdom shines like the sun and moon—this is called great brightness. The source of utmost yang signifies descent from the root and advance—hence it is said to emerge. When unaroused, the root is deeply still and serene. The source of utmost yin signifies gathering the branches to return to the root—hence it is said to enter the gate of profound obscurity. Broadly Accomplished Master showed the Yellow Emperor the two principles of movement and stillness, thus employing the two gates of yin and yang.

Heaven and earth have their offices, yin and yang have their repositories.

**[Annotation]** Simply let them be.

Guard your body with care, and things will flourish of themselves.

**[Subcommentary]** The offices of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars, which illuminate the four directions and govern the myriad things—hence they are called offices. The offices of earth are metal, wood, water, fire, and soil, which sustain the living and the growing, bearing and carrying all beings—hence they too are called offices. The two qi of yin and yang, spring and summer, autumn and winter, each have their overseers, like the organs and viscera. All follow their nature without obstruction—why defy creation by setting up further offices? If you but practice non-action and guard your body with care, all things will naturally prosper—why trouble the mind and invite sorrow?

I preserve the One and abide in harmony; thus I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never decayed.

**[Annotation]** This is to exhaust the utmost of life and destiny, to reach the ultimate of long life.

**[Subcommentary]** Preserving tranquility and the One, dwelling in the wondrous harmony of the Dao, nurturing and protecting the body—though the years may be long, there will be no day of decline.

Only one whose body does not decay prematurely can extend care to others.

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and said: "Broadly Accomplished Master is what is meant by Heaven!"

**[Annotation]** Heaven is non-action.

**[Subcommentary]** The loftiness of the sage’s Dao may join in virtue with the mysterious Heaven.

Broadly Accomplished Master said: "Come. I shall tell you more."

Those beings are without end, yet people all deem them finite;
**[Subcommentary]** Life and death, transformation—such principles are endless, yet the common folk, deluded and confused, believe in beginnings and endings.

Those beings are unfathomable, yet people all deem them bounded;
**[Annotation]** They see only one of their transformations.
**[Subcommentary]** The myriad beings are beyond measure, shifting through a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, yet the foolish cling to the notion of limits.

One who attains my Dao may ascend as Sovereign or descend as King;
**[Annotation]** The titles of Sovereign and King vary with the rise and fall of the age, yet in attaining the Dao of adaptability to respond to the endless, they are one.
**[Subcommentary]** One who grasps the Dao of spontaneity, encountering an era of pristine simplicity, becomes a Fuxi or Shen Nong; facing an age of decadence, responds as Tang or Wu. Whether Sovereign or King, through peace or peril, the Dao remains one.

One who loses my Dao may appear radiant above yet become earth below;
**[Annotation]** Losing the endless Dao, one clings to a single transformation, unable to harmonize above and below, thus bowing and rising with divided heart.
**[Subcommentary]** Forsaking the Dao of non-action, mired in the heart of desire, one may live in the light of glory but in death revert to dust. Deluded by life and death, unable to harmonize above and below, one bears two names.

Now, the hundred flourishing beings all arise from earth and return to earth—thus I shall leave you.
**[Annotation]** Earth is without intent. Born from the unintentional, one must return to guard the unintentional and journey alone.
**[Subcommentary]** All flourishing beings arise from the earth, and when they wither, return to the soil. The myriad things of the world are born from nothingness and, in death, revert to emptiness. Unbound by life or death, untethered to any single state, I now depart from you to follow my course.

I enter the gate of the endless to wander the boundless wilds;
**[Annotation]** To move as one with transformation.
**[Subcommentary]** Returning to the profound stillness of the origin, entering the gate of the endless, responding to change between heaven and earth, roaming the boundless wilds.

I share the radiance of the sun and moon, I endure with heaven and earth.
**[Annotation]** To yield entirely to it.
**[Subcommentary]** To share (参) is to be one. Aligning with the three luminaries in brightness, matching the two poles in duration—how could it be a mere thousand two hundred years?

When near me, all is luminous; when far from me, all is dark.

The comings and goings of things—all pass unperceived.
**[Annotation]** The sage’s mind is like a mirror: when the mechanism meets stimulus, it responds in hidden accord; if no stimulus comes, it remains dim and obscure.

"All others will perish entirely, yet I alone endure?"
**[Annotation]** To regard death and life as one body is to find no place where one does not endure.
**[Subcommentary]** To unite death and life is to illuminate transformation—nothing has ever ceased to be the self. With no going and no coming, I alone endure.

People cling to life and death, and thus know sorrow and rest.

Cloud General was traveling east when he passed the branch of the Whirling Gale and there chanced upon Vast Vagueness. Vast Vagueness was just then clapping his knees and leaping about in play.
**[Subcommentary]** *Cloud General*: the lord of clouds. *Vast Vagueness*: primordial qi. *Whirling Gale*: the spirit of the tree, born in the Eastern Sea—also called the wind. *Chanced upon*: encountered. *Clapping*: striking. *Leaping about*: jumping in play. This is a parable. Qi is the source of living things; clouds are the root of rain and moisture; the tree is the realm of spring yang; the east is the direction of benevolence and kindness. These four images show the ruler how to govern: virtue and beneficence come first.

When Cloud General saw him,
**[Subcommentary]** Marveling at his appearance, so unlike the common world, and his movements, so different from the ordinary, he asked the reason for his journey, hoping to learn how to order things rightly.

he halted in astonishment, stood motionless, and said: "Old sir, who are you? What are you doing here?"

The Venerable Hongmeng continued leaping and bounding without cease, and replied to Cloud General: "Wandering."
**[Subcommentary]** Roaming freely through the transformations of nature.

Cloud General said: "I wish to ask you something."
Hongmeng looked up at Cloud General and sighed: "Hmm!"

Cloud General said: "Heaven’s qi is disharmonious, earth’s qi is pent up—
**[Subcommentary]** The two qi neither descend nor ascend, thus pent up.
the six qi are unbalanced,
**[Subcommentary]** Yin and yang, wind and rain, darkness and light—these are the six qi.
and the four seasons are out of joint.
**[Subcommentary]** Spring, summer, autumn, and winter—seasonal ordinances are disordered in their sequence.
Now I wish to blend the essence of the six qi to nurture all living things. How should I go about it?"
**[Subcommentary]** I desire to harmonize the essence of the six qi to nourish the myriad beings, hence my question.

The Venerable Hongmeng continued leaping and bounding, shook his head, and said: "I do not know. I do not know."
**[Subcommentary]** All things receive their nature spontaneously; if one deliberately intervenes to order them, this contravenes the workings of creation, hence he shook his head and gave no answer.

Cloud General could get no answer.
Three years later, he journeyed eastward, passing through the wilds of Song, where he chanced upon Hongmeng again.
Cloud General rejoiced greatly, hastened forward, and said: "Has Heaven forgotten me? Has Heaven forgotten me?"
He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and entreated Hongmeng: "I wish to hear your teaching."
**[Subcommentary]** As though addressing Heaven itself, he repeated "forgotten me" in hopes of recalling their former encounter.

Hongmeng said: "Drifting, knowing not what I seek—
**[Annotation]** Yet attaining what I seek.
**[Subcommentary]** Drifting through the world, without deliberate pursuit.
Wild and unrestrained, knowing not where I go—
**[Annotation]** Yet attaining where I go.
**[Subcommentary]** Without intent or fixed course, without set destination.
The wanderer moves freely, observing the primal and the illusory.
**[Annotation]** One who is inwardly sufficient finds all things naturally correct.
**[Subcommentary]** Hongmeng’s wandering heart roams boundlessly, encountering myriad things; his observing wisdom knows that the realm he perceives is without falsehood. *Freely* here means "in abundance."
What do I know?"
**[Annotation]** This is all there is to it.

Yunjiang said: "I deemed myself wild and unrestrained, yet the people follow wherever I go. I cannot escape them—now they imitate me in all things."

**[Annotation]** One who rides the world does not advance by force, yet the Way manifests of itself; one who is wild and unrestrained does not summon the people, yet the people follow of themselves. Thus, compelled by the people’s imitation, one cannot but yield.

**[Subcommentary]** Like Hongmeng, I wander without intent to govern, yet find myself among men; the people follow and imitate me, and so I am made to serve as their model.

"I wish to hear a single word."

**[Subcommentary]** I wish to hear the essential teaching, that my deep doubts may be resolved.

Hongmeng said: "To disorder heaven’s principles, to oppose the nature of things—then the mysterious workings of heaven cannot be fulfilled."

**[Annotation]** If one follows the nature of things without governing, then feelings are not opposed and principles are not disordered; the profound stillness is complete, and the natural is attained.

**[Subcommentary]** To disorder heaven’s constant Way, to oppose the true nature of things—then deceit and cunning arise, and the transformations of the natural are not fulfilled.

"To loose the beasts’ assaults, and the birds all cry out at night;"

**[Annotation]** They depart from their state of stillness.

**[Subcommentary]** When imitation spreads and prominence is sought, harm to things blazes forth: beasts are startled into scattering, birds are frightened into night cries.

"Disaster reaches the grasses and trees, calamity befalls the insects."

**[Annotation]** All suffer harm while sitting idle.

**[Subcommentary]** Grasses and trees wither before frost, and calamity reaches the insects. *Kun* means "bright," facing the sun, opening and settling.

"Alas! This is the fault of those who govern."

**[Annotation]** Where there is governance, there is escape; from this, disorder arises.

**[Subcommentary]** Heaven’s governance is destroyed—this is the fault of those who govern.

Yunjiang said: "Then what am I to do?"

**[Subcommentary]** He wishes to learn the defense of non-governance.

Hongmeng said: "Alas! How poisonous!"

**[Annotation]** The fault of those who govern runs deep.

**[Subcommentary]** He sighs repeatedly at the repeated wounds and disasters.

*Yu*—a sound of lament.

"Restlessly, return!"

**[Annotation]** *Juanjuan*: the appearance of rising and sitting. Suspecting he cannot suddenly break free and roam at ease, he sends him to return.

**[Subcommentary]** *Juanjuan*: the appearance of light rising. Fearing Yunjiang’s governance of things will bring calamity, he demonstrates light rising and urges him to cease his entanglements and return to the root.

Yunjiang said: "I have encountered great difficulty. I wish to hear a single word."

Hongmeng said: "Alas! Cultivate the heart-mind."

**[Annotation]** When the heart-mind is harmed by use, then to cultivate the heart-mind—is it not to refrain from using the heart-mind?

**[Subcommentary]** The extension of cultivating the heart-mind is set forth below.

"Simply abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves."

**[Subcommentary]** *Tu*: merely. Merely abide in the heart-mind’s non-action, and things will transform of themselves.

"Cast off your form, expel your brilliance; let reason and things be forgotten."

**[Annotation]** When principle and things are not held in the heart, but are entrusted to the natural, then there is non-action, and transformation occurs of itself.

**[Subcommentary]** *Lun*: principle. To cast off form is to forget the body; to expel brilliance is to forget the heart-mind. When body and heart-mind are both forgotten, self and things are both relinquished—this is cultivating the heart-mind.

"Merge in great sameness with the turbid and the clear."

**[Annotation]** To be without boundary with things.

**[Subcommentary]** *Qi* and *jin* are the qi of spontaneity. Vast and boundless, body and heart-mind merge in great sameness, naturally uniting with the whole. Release the heart-mind, liberate the spirit—become utterly devoid of soul.

**[Annotation]** Sit in forgetfulness, entrusting to solitude.

**[Subcommentary]** *Hun*: the pursuit of discriminating knowledge. *Jie shi* (release and dissolve): to dispel and let go. *Moran* (utterly devoid): without knowledge. Scouring and purifying the heart-mind, one becomes like dead ashes or withered wood—without knowing soul.

The myriad things, teeming and multitudinous, each return to their root; each return to their root yet do not know it.

**[Annotation]** To return without knowing is the true return.

**[Subcommentary]** *Yun yun*: in great numbers. The multitudes come and go, arising and perishing without departing from spontaneity. Their return to the root is evident—how could one rely on knowledge to restore the mandate?

Chaotic and undifferentiated, one remains thus for a lifetime without departure.

**[Annotation]** Abiding in chaos without knowledge, entrusting to spontaneous return—only thus can one remain lifelong without departing from the root.

**[Subcommentary]** Chaos without knowledge, entrusting to solitude—through ten thousand transformations, one does not depart from spontaneity. If one knows it, then one has already departed from it.

**[Annotation]** To return through knowledge is to deviate from return.

**[Subcommentary]** To employ knowledge in longing for the root is to depart from the natural nature.

Ask not its name, inquire not into its conditions—things arise of themselves.

**[Annotation]** To inquire is to lose their spontaneous arising.

**[Subcommentary]** The Dao is beyond names and words; principle is beyond conditions and thoughts. If one seeks the Dao through names or inquires into principle through conditions, how far astray one goes! Only by relinquishing conditions and forgetting names, entrusting to solitary transformation, do things attain their inherent principle.

Cloud General said: "Heaven bestowed virtue upon me, revealed silence to me. Seeking it in my own person, only now have I attained it."

**[Annotation]** To know yet not remain silent is to constantly lose oneself.

**[Subcommentary]** Bestowing words of virtue and power, demonstrating the practice of profound stillness—since establishing myself, only now have I awakened. Bowing twice with head to the ground, he rose, took leave, and departed.

The people of the world all delight in others being the same as themselves and detest others being different from themselves.

**[Subcommentary]** Those mired in habitual patterns, deluded and attached for so long, rejoice in sameness and fear difference.

Those who desire sameness with themselves and reject difference do so with the intent to stand out from the crowd.

**[Annotation]** The heart-mind desires to stand out from the ordinary and be the center of the crowd.

**[Subcommentary]** To affirm oneself and negate others, to delight in sameness and detest difference—this is invariably to display one’s merit and fame, to surpass the multitude. Yet those who take standing out from the crowd as their aim—how can they ever truly stand out?

**[Annotation]** All take standing out as their aim, and thus they are the crowd. If I too desire to stand out from the crowd, then I am no different from them and cannot surpass them. When all take surpassing others as their aim, and I alone go along without resistance, then I am vastly different from the crowd and become their master.

**[Subcommentary]** People take competing to stand out from the crowd as their aim—this is the vulgar sentiment of ordinary things. How can one alone transcend the ordinary? Only by merging with their radiance and dust can one be vastly different from the crowd and become their paragon.

Relying on the multitude to secure what one has heard is better than relying on the skills of the multitude.

**[Annotation]** What I alone have heard is not as much as the skills of the multitude, so it is better to rely on them. If one does not rely on the multitude, then the thousands upon thousands of the multitude become one’s adversaries.

**[Subcommentary]** Employing the skills of the multitude, relying on their knowledge and perceptions—this is without contention. This is what is meant by "the enlightened see for them, the wise plan for them."

Yet those who desire to govern others’ states seize the benefits of the Three Kings without seeing the harm.

**[Annotation]** Those who desire to govern others’ states, not relying on the multitude’s self-governance but imposing their own governance—this is to seek the benefits of the Three Kings in ruling things while failing to see the exhaustion of governing by oneself. Yet how did the Three Kings attain their benefits? They relied on the self-governance of all under heaven and entrusted to it.

**[Subcommentary]** Those who govern a state with their own partial attachments seek only the benefits of the Three Kings in ruling things, unaware that this brings great harm to themselves. This is to gamble with others’ states—how many such gambles do not result in the loss of others’ states?

Those who preserve others’ states are fewer than one in ten thousand; those who lose others’ states fail once and bring ruin to more than ten thousand.

**[Annotation]** Oneself and all under heaven are mutually reliant in completion. Now, if one alone monopolizes control over all under heaven, then all under heaven is obstructed—how can one be unobstructed? Thus, the self is not completed, and the myriad regions suffer ruin.

**[Subcommentary]** Those who govern as emperors and kings with a gambler’s heart—when it comes to preserving themselves, not one succeeds; when it comes to ruin, there is more than enough. Alas, how ignorant are those who possess lands!

Those who possess lands possess great things.

**[Subcommentary]** The exalted position of the Nine-Five, vast and expansive as the four seas—this is called a great thing.

Those who possess great things cannot be used by things.

**[Annotation]** Unable to use things but instead used by things—this is merely a thing. How can one use things?

If one cannot use things, then one is not sufficient to possess great things.

**[Subcommentary]** If one seeks the state of the Three Kings yet cannot entrust things to self-governance, one is instead used by things. If one is oneself a thing, how can one use things? This is utterly impossible. Only by not being used by things can one use things.

**[Annotation]** Those who use things are not used by things. Not being used by things, they are not things. Not being things, they can use the things of all under heaven, allowing each to attain its own nature.

The subcommentary states: not being used by things yet able to use things. Clearly, those who use things are not things themselves—how could their governance be limited to the people of all under heaven? They move within the six directions, roam across the nine provinces.

**[Annotation]** Using the self-governance of all under heaven, they drive the myriad things without exhaustion.

**[Subcommentary]** The sage penetrates the natural, comprehends creation, employs the knowledge of the people, and utilizes the senses of all living beings. Thus, those who use things are not things themselves. How could their role be confined to wearing the imperial crown, sitting in the Fenyang Palace, bearing the jade seal, and ruling the world? They must instead transcend the six directions, ascend the great purity, surpass the nine provinces, and wander the Gushe Mountains. Alone they come, alone they go—this is called possessing singularity. Possessing singularity in this singular way may truly be called singular possession. Those who possess singularity are called the most noble.

**[Annotation]** Those who harmonize with the multitude in profound unity do not seek nobility among the crowd, yet the crowd cannot but regard them as noble—this is the highest nobility. If one clings to partial views and takes singularity as one’s heart, then even if one aligns with a single purpose, one remains but a thing among the vulgar, opposing true singular possession. Without possessing singularity, one may covet rank and emblems, usurping what is not one’s due—how could the multitude ever follow?

**[Subcommentary]** While others distinguish themselves, one alone wanders in harmony—this is alone coming, alone going. Possessing singularity in this singular way may truly be called singular possession. While others seek to stand out, one alone wanders freely, a capacity none possess—hence the name singular possession. Those who possess singularity are joyfully upheld by the people, borne by the masses. To make such a one their lord is to attain the highest honor and nobility.

The teachings of the great person are like a shadow following form, an echo responding to sound.

**[Annotation]** The hearts of the people are form and sound; the teachings of the great person are shadow and echo. What intent does the great person hold toward all under heaven? They are but shadow and echo following form and sound.

**[Subcommentary]** The great person is the sage. Without intent, they respond—response is not by intent. Thus, the hearts of the people are form and sound; the teachings of the great person are shadow and echo. When questioned, they respond, exhausting what is held within.

**[Annotation]** Allowing each being’s held aspirations to attain their full expression.

**[Subcommentary]** The sage’s heart follows the stimulus of things, responding in accord with the moment, exhausting the aspirations of all beings. They pair with all under heaven.

**[Annotation]** The questioner is the host; the response is the counterpart.

**[Subcommentary]** *Pair* means to match: the first stimulus is the host; the response is the counterpart. They abide in no echo.

**[Annotation]** They await things in stillness.

**[Subcommentary]** *Abide* means stillness. In times without stimulus, the heart is like withered wood, still and without shadow or echo. They move without fixed direction.

**[Annotation]** They transform in accord with things.

**[Subcommentary]** *Move* means to respond to the moment. They adapt to the moment without fixed place. They lift and guide you, returning you to the restless stirrings.

**[Annotation]** *Restless stirrings* means self-movement. Lifting and guiding the myriad things, they return them to the nature of self-movement—this is the perfection of non-action.

**[Subcommentary]** *Restless stirrings* means self-movement. Adapting to the moment without fixed direction, they seek to lift and guide you and others of the common sort, returning you to your original nature—this is the perfection of non-action. They wander without end.

**[Annotation]** They move with transformation, hence without end.

**[Subcommentary]** *Wander* means the heart moves in unison with the natural—hence without trace or boundary. They enter and exit without side.

**[Annotation]** Profoundly identical, without outward mark.

**[Subcommentary]** Entering and exiting the dust and bounds of life and death, they are profoundly one with creation, without visible edge. They share no beginning with the sun.

**[Annotation]** They renew together with each day, hence without beginning.

**[Subcommentary]** Renewing together with each day, they are without end or beginning. Praising and discussing the bodily form, they unite with the great harmony.

**[Annotation]** Their form and appearance differ not from heaven and earth.

**[Subcommentary]** *Praise* and *discuss* are words. The sage’s abundant virtue and bodily form unite with the great Way of the two powers, outwardly not bounded by the cosmos, inwardly not possessing their own body. They unite with the great harmony yet have no self.

**[Annotation]** With self, one cannot unite with the great harmony.

**[Subcommentary]** United with the two powers and the great Way, both self and other are forgotten. Without self, how could there be anything possessed?

**[Annotation]** The difficulty in all under heaven lies in the self. Once the self is gone, the myriad things are no longer sufficient to be possessed.

**[Subcommentary]** Once the self is gone, how could things exist? Those who perceive being are the gentlemen of old.

**[Annotation]** They are merely those who beautify their names.

**[Subcommentary]** Those who practice benevolence and righteousness, observe ritual and lord-subject relations, do not depart from being—these are the gentlemen. Those who perceive non-being are friends of heaven and earth.

**[Annotation]** Perceiving non-being, they allow things to live in their singularity.

**[Subcommentary]** Perceiving the wondrous principle of non-action, seeing the true nature of the natural, the two powers are not being, the myriad things are all empty—turning from being to enter non-being, they are thus called friends. What is lowly yet cannot be left unentrusted is things; what is humble yet cannot be left unaccommodated is the people.

**[Annotation]** Accommodating their nature and entrusting them leads to order; opposing their nature and overpowering them leads to chaos. The reason the people and things are humble and lowly is their inability to be accommodated and entrusted. Thus, entrusting the lowly makes them noble; accommodating the humble makes them honored—this is the natural tally.

**[Subcommentary]** Though the people dwell below, each has their function; though things are light and lowly, all bear their use. No material is to be discarded, no person is to be left unused—thus all may flourish. What is hidden yet cannot be left undone is affairs.

**[Annotation]** Affairs are concealed in that, hence hidden. Each acts on its own, hence cannot be left undone—but one should only accommodate and entrust them.

**[Subcommentary]** *Hidden* means concealed.

Affairs possess concealment and manifestation; natures bear skill and clumsiness. Some manifest here, some conceal there; some are skillful here, some clumsy there—yet one should only entrust them, and all affairs become equal.

That which is evident yet cannot remain unexpressed is *law*.
**[Annotation]** Law is the advancement of wondrous affairs—how can one be remiss and fail to express wondrous affairs?
**[Subcommentary]** Law refers to teaching. Teaching aims at principle, yet principle is wondrous while law is coarse—like the fish-trap and rabbit-snare, it must be expressed.

That which is distant yet cannot remain unoccupied is *rightness*.
**[Annotation]** Only by occupying it does one make it distant.
**[Subcommentary]** Though rightness is remote from the Dao, if it accords with principle, one must adopt and decide by it.

That which is intimate yet cannot remain narrow is *benevolence*.
**[Annotation]** Intimacy may be partial, thus only by broadening it does one achieve benevolence.
**[Subcommentary]** Though intimacy may be partial and love limited, encompassing and universal love is great benevolence.

That which is regulated yet cannot remain unaccumulated is *ritual*.
**[Annotation]** Ritual regulation halts at fixation on one thing; when each thing embodies it, it accumulates and becomes all-encompassing.
**[Subcommentary]** Accumulation means depth. Regulation is pattern. Ritual values reciprocity, yet human feelings are shallow and thin—thus outwardly it displays refined movements while inwardly it fosters profound accumulation: this is true ritual.

That which is centered yet cannot remain lowly is *virtue*.
**[Annotation]** In affairs of inferiority, though centered, it is not virtue.
**[Subcommentary]** Centered means compliant. Those who cultivate the Dao harmonize their light and dwell in the world, humbling themselves before things while their aspirations and conduct remain lofty—though steeped in defilement, their virtue remains unstained.

That which is unified yet cannot remain unchanged is the *Dao*.
**[Annotation]** In difficult affairs, though unified, it is not the Dao—how much less when not unified?
**[Subcommentary]** The wondrous origin is a single qi, universally generating the myriad things—so utterly simple and easy, is this not the Dao?

That which is numinous yet cannot remain unenacted is *Heaven*.
**[Annotation]** To cling to intent and refuse to act—though numinous, it is not Heaven; how much less when not numinous?
**[Subcommentary]** Heaven’s numinous workings are unfathomable, manifesting and concealing without fixed pattern, responding to the moment without obstruction—this accords with Heaven’s nature.

Thus the sage observes Heaven yet does not assist,
**[Annotation]** Simply following its self-enactment.
**[Subcommentary]** The sage observes the wondrous principle of nature, greatly complying with things without aiding their inherent dispositions. *The following explains the preceding text.*

accomplishes virtue yet is not burdened,
**[Annotation]** Naturally meeting in lofty convergence.
**[Subcommentary]** Able to make realm and wisdom merge in darkness, once supreme virtue is accomplished, it is naturally free from flaws and burdens.

emerges from the Dao yet does not scheme,
**[Annotation]** Not scheming yet unified—this is the body’s way.
**[Subcommentary]** Manifesting the wondrously unified Dao, how could one wait for schemes to further expound it? *The* Laozi *states: "Acting without reliance."* Benevolence and universal love are prized for their appropriateness—thus there is no reliance.

is sparing in rightness yet does not accumulate,
**[Annotation]** Following one’s nature and dwelling in remoteness is not accumulation.
**[Subcommentary]** The thatched huts of the former kings were not to be treasured; once straw dogs have been displayed, how could they be accumulated and retained?

responds to ritual yet does not taboo,
**[Annotation]** Naturally responding to ritual, not through avoidance of taboos.
**[Subcommentary]** The wondrous origin is profoundly still—advancing to respond to ritual, how could it be bound by taboos?

engages with affairs yet does not decline,
**[Annotation]** Affairs are engaged through principle; success or failure rests with oneself. One responds to movement with movement, without refusal or declination.
**[Subcommentary]** Blending with the world and riding its waves, one engages with things as affairs arise, responding to the moment without selection or declination.

equalizes through law yet is not disordered,
**[Annotation]** Governing the coarse with the wondrous, thus it is not disordered.
**[Subcommentary]** Following the natures of things, one equalizes them with law—thus there is no disorder.

attends to the people yet does not belittle them,
**[Annotation]** Relying on their self-enactment, not lightly employing them.
**[Subcommentary]** The people are the state’s root; when the root is firm, the state is tranquil—thus one attends to and relies on them without daring to employ them lightly.

follows things yet does not abandon them.
**[Annotation]** Following and entrusting them, not abandoning their root.
**[Subcommentary]** Complying with the hearts of the black-haired people and following the natures of the myriad things, though applying laws and teachings, one does not allow them to become mixed with their original nature.

Things are never sufficient to act upon, yet cannot remain unacted upon.
**[Annotation]** Why act because they are sufficient to act upon? This acting is self-embodied—thus it cannot be stopped.
**[Subcommentary]** The endowment of things in their arising is of myriad differences—like the dung-beetle rolling its pellet or the spider weaving its web, emerging from Heaven’s nature, not dependent on acquired learning. Thus what is absent in their nature cannot be forcibly enacted, while what is present in their nature cannot remain unenacted.

Those who are unclear about Heaven are not pure in virtue;
**[Annotation]** Being unclear about nature leads to contrivance; with contrivance, virtue is not pure.
**[Subcommentary]** Aligning with nature’s principle, then the shallow and thin virtue is not pure.

those who do not penetrate the Dao have no means by which to proceed;
**[Annotation]** Unable to empty oneself and await things, one loses accord in every affair.
**[Subcommentary]** Obstructing the empty and wondrous Dao-nature, thus in every encounter one fails—truly there is no means by which to proceed.

those who are unclear about the Dao—how lamentable!
**[Subcommentary]** Aligning with Heaven and humanity’s principle yet confusing the meaning of ruler and minister, their undertakings are all constricted—deeply lamentable.

What is the Dao?
There is the Dao of Heaven, and the Dao of Man.

Without action yet revered—this is the Dao of Heaven.
**[Annotation]** Above yet allowing the myriad things to act of themselves.
**[Subcommentary]** Free from affairs and action, exalted and on high—this accords with the natural Dao of Heaven.

With action yet encumbered—this is the Dao of Man.
**[Annotation]** To be burdened by action is to fail in following one’s spontaneous attainment.
**[Subcommentary]** Managing duties with action, entangled in worldly cares—this is the Dao of human relations.

The ruler embodies the Dao of Heaven;
**[Annotation]** In harmony with Heaven’s letting-be of things, one naturally presides over them.
**[Subcommentary]** The sovereign, above and allowing things to be, accords with the non-action of Heaven’s Dao.

The minister embodies the Dao of Man.
**[Annotation]** Each fulfills their proper charge.

Between the Dao of Heaven and the Dao of Man, the distance is vast.
**[Annotation]** The ruler practices non-action and delegates to the hundred officials; the officials each have their duties, while the ruler does not intervene. Both attain spontaneity through non-action, yet the ruler’s path is ease, the minister’s path is toil—between their labor and leisure, they cannot be spoken of in the same breath.
**[Subcommentary]** The ruler’s position is exalted, entrusted to stewards; the minister’s path is humble, exhausting sincerity in service to the throne. Thus the ruler’s path is ease, the minister’s path is toil—they cannot be spoken of in the same breath.

This must not go unexamined.
**[Annotation]** Without examination, the positions of ruler and minister become disordered.
**[Subcommentary]** The Dao of Heaven is for the ruler and non-action; the Dao of Man is for the minister and affairs. With hierarchy distinct and labor and leisure unequal, each keeping to their station, then ruler and minister alike attain non-action. If one fails to discern this principle, labor and leisure become misaligned, and ruler and minister fall into disorder.

The Two Modes generate and nurture, their transformations boundless. Within the realm of form and substance, they are most vast, ever renewing and changing, moment by moment advancing—truly equal and impartial, what is called "nurturing and ripening."

*Zhuangzi: Annotated and Subcommented, Scroll Fourteen*
*Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan*

**Tang Dynasty Master of the Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying’s Subcommentary**
*Outer Chapters, "Heaven and Earth" (Chapter Twelve)*

Though heaven and earth are vast, their transformations are uniform.
**Annotation:** Uniform in their non-action, transforming of themselves.
**Subcommentary:** The Two Modes engender and nurture, covering and bearing without end. Among all forms and substances, they are the most expansive. Yet their ceaseless transformations remain unchanged in appearance; their moment-to-moment transience is truly equal—this is what is meant by "leveling" them. Thus it is said: "Heaven and earth give birth to me, and all things are born alongside me."

Though the myriad things are numerous, their governance is one.
**Annotation:** Governance is achieved through self-attainment.
**Subcommentary:** The four modes of generation produce the myriad things, their kinds most abundant. Yet when each follows its nature and attains itself, this principle is singular—this is what is meant by "harmonizing" them. Thus it is further said: "The myriad things and I are one."

Though the masses of people are many, their lord is the ruler.
**Annotation:** When the world harbors divergent minds, the mindless one becomes the lord.
**Subcommentary:** Though the black-haired commoners and servants are numerous, the one who rules as lord is but a single person. Without intent, following and yielding, one rightfully occupies this position.

The ruler originates in virtue and is completed by heaven.
**Annotation:** Taking virtue as its origin, nothing fails to attain. The attainer attains of itself, thus attainment incurs no gratitude—this is how heaven is completed.
**Subcommentary:** *Yuan* means "origin." The ruler of men and things must take virtue as its foundation. Each thing attains itself, thus fully realizing the nature of spontaneity. Hence it is said: "The ancient rulers of the world in the distant past governed without action, possessing only the virtue of heaven."

**Annotation:** Following the spontaneous movement of nature.
**Subcommentary:** *Xuan* means "distant." The ancient rulers refer to the emperors before the Three Sovereigns. It is said that the sage rulers of antiquity governed the world without action—what did they do? This cites the ancients to verify the present, establishing the meaning of heavenly virtue.

Viewing through the Dao in speech, the rulers of the world are upright.
**Annotation:** The non-active naturally become rulers, not through perversity.
**Subcommentary:** Observing the principle of emptiness and penetration in the workings of response to things, the ruler who acts without action and follows without contrivance does not employ perverse speech, thus rightly attaining the kingly way.

Viewing through the Dao in division, the righteousness of ruler and minister is clear.
**Annotation:** Each abiding in its proper place, the non-active occupy the superior position, the active the inferior.
**Subcommentary:** The way of the ruler is non-action, while the way of the minister involves affairs. Noble and base, labor and ease—by principle, they are inherently distinct. For example, the head naturally resides above, the feet below. Observing through the Dao, the righteousness of their division is evident.

Viewing through the Dao in ability, the offices of the world are well-governed.
**Annotation:** Each office is well-governed according to its ability.
**Subcommentary:** Though offices vary in rank and abilities in excellence, when each receives its proper duty, things are impartially attained. Thus the offices of the world are well-governed.

Viewing through the Dao in generality, the responses of the myriad things are complete.
**Annotation:** Without action, the world responds to each through its own non-action.
**Subcommentary:** The great Dao generates things, whose natures and dispositions differ. Following their own inclinations, all are fully equipped—some run, some fly, each responding to its use, unaware of how, nor where the mind is applied. Thus observing through principle in its entirety, the responses of the myriad things are complete.

Therefore, that which penetrates heaven and earth is virtue.
**Annotation:** When nothing fails to attain, heaven and earth are penetrated.
**Subcommentary:** *Tong* means "to unite." That which unites with the covering and bearing of the Two Modes, co-arising with heaven and earth, is virtue.

That which moves through the myriad things is the Dao.
**Annotation:** When the Dao does not obstruct its course, the myriad things naturally attain their movement.
**Subcommentary:** The ultimate principle is unobstructed, allowing things to come and go freely. Moving together with the myriad things, it is called the Dao.

That which governs people above is affairs.
**Annotation:** Allowing each person to attain their own affairs.
**Subcommentary:** Though governing people, one follows their fundamental nature. Each thing follows its ability, and power naturally accords with fitness. Each affair is fitting, and the world is well-governed.

That which possesses skill is technique.
**Annotation:** Technique is what the myriad things do not employ.
**Subcommentary:** Following their fundamental nature, each has its own skill and ability, not relying on external fabrication—thus true technique flourishes.

Technique is encompassed by affairs, affairs by righteousness, righteousness by virtue, virtue by the Dao, the Dao by heaven.
**Annotation:** The mutual encompassing of root and branch is like the mutual enfolding of hand and arm. Thus when the body is harmonious, all joints are at ease; when the heavenly Dao is followed, root and branch are both unimpeded.
**Subcommentary:** *Jian* means "to carry," "to aid," "to return." The skills of technique must be carried by affairs. Without being carried by affairs, where would technique be applied? If affairs are improper, technique becomes useless. Though proceeding through righteousness, it must not deviate from virtue. Though possessing this virtue, in principle it must model itself on the emptiness and penetration of the Dao. Thus it is said: emptiness and penetration ultimately return to the flourishing of spontaneity. This is the mutual enfolding of principle and affair, though their functions differ. Hence it demonstrates the meaning of the root embracing the branch, proceeding from the shallow to the profound.

Thus it is said: "The ancients who nurtured the world had no desires, and the world was sufficient; they acted without action, and the myriad things were transformed."
**Subcommentary:** To embrace the world is to act without action; to embrace the Dao is to be without desire. Thus the ancient emperors who nurtured and reared the multitudes—what did they do? They had no desires, and the black-haired people were each sufficient; they acted without action, and the myriad things transformed themselves.

Profoundly still, the hundred clans were settled.
**Subcommentary:** One person hangs his robe and remains in profound silence, and the hundred clans are such that every household could be enfeoffed. Thus the *Laozi* says: "I value stillness, and the people rectify themselves." The *Records* state: "Penetrate the One, and the myriad affairs are complete."

**Subcommentary:** The One is the Dao. Affairs arise from principle, and principle must encompass affairs. The root can embrace the branch, thus knowing the One, the myriad affairs are complete. This saying appears in the *Scripture of Western Ascent*, and Zhuangzi cites it as evidence.

Without intent, one attains—and ghosts and spirits submit.

**Annotation:** Acting without action, all principles naturally align.

**Subcommentary:** When one delves into the affairs of the undifferentiated human realm, verifying the principle of spontaneity through the mind, plumbing origins and penetrating boundaries, and mastering the subtlety of profound mystery—then, in the manifest, all beings turn toward them, and in the hidden, even ghosts and spirits submit. The Master said: "The Dao—it covers and sustains the myriad things, vast and boundless! How great!" The noble person cannot but purge the heart.

**Annotation:** With intent, one burdens spontaneity; thus, one must excise and remove it.

**Subcommentary:** The Master here is Laozi. Zhuangzi took Laozi as his teacher, hence he is called "the Master." *Zhi* means to remove, to cleanse. The Dao of emptiness and penetration encompasses all without exclusion. The Two Modes depend on it for covering and sustaining, and the myriad things obtain it to transform and live. What does not proceed from this? It is the root of all things. Marveling at its vast and boundless greatness, he exhorts the lords of the age: should they not model themselves on the Dao’s nothingness, washing away the burden of intent?

Acting without acting is called Heaven.

**Annotation:** Not acting for this act, yet this act acts itself—this is the Heavenly Dao.

**Subcommentary:** "Acting without acting" means moving in accord with one’s nature. The mechanism of Heaven unfolds of itself, hence it is called Heaven. This is "not acting for this act."

Speaking without speaking is called virtue.

**Annotation:** Not speaking for this speech, yet this speech speaks itself—this is true virtue.

**Subcommentary:** Silent and wordless, yet responding without limit—like a mirror hung high in the hall, things come and are reflected. Speech and silence are no different, hence it is called virtue. This is "not speaking for this speech."

Loving people and benefiting things is called benevolence.

**Annotation:** This is following the natural dispositions of life and destiny.

**Subcommentary:** Compassion flows like clouds, love showers like rain. Without partiality in the heart, virtue’s blessings spread far and wide. Cherishing life and destiny, this is called benevolence.

Not forcing sameness upon differences is called greatness.

**Annotation:** The myriad things take myriad forms, each right in its place. Not drawing others to be the same as oneself—this is what makes one great.

**Subcommentary:** Carving and sculpting the multitude of forms, each with its distinct nature—following their inherent allotment, merging with spontaneity, acting without cutting or dividing—this is called greatness.

Acting without eccentricity is called magnanimity.

**Annotation:** Mysteriously identifying with others, the myriad things naturally find room, hence there is abundance.

**Subcommentary:** Concealing brilliance and obscuring traces, blending with the world and riding its waves—if one’s virtue is no different from others, and one’s conduct no different from things, yet the heart has no boundaries, like a lake of ten thousand acres, where forests and marshes teem with life—this may be called magnanimity.

Possessing ten thousand differences is called wealth.

**Annotation:** Without difference from myself, I alone can possess these ten thousand.

**Subcommentary:** Occupying the position of the Nine-Fives, wielding the might of ten thousand chariots, embracing the myriad things in their differences, following the people in their diversity, allowing all natures to find their place—thus one can be rich in possessing all under Heaven.

Thus, holding fast to virtue is called the guiding principle.

**Annotation:** Virtue is the guiding thread of human beings.

**Subcommentary:** One who can uphold their inherent virtue may be called the guiding thread of things.

Virtue’s completion is called establishment.

**Annotation:** What is not completed through virtue cannot be called establishment.

**Subcommentary:** Only when virtue is complete can one establish merit and aid others.

Following the Dao is called fulfillment.

**Annotation:** The Dao is not partial to any one thing.

**Subcommentary:** *Xun* means to follow. Only by following emptiness and penetration is one’s virtue fully sufficient.

Not allowing things to thwart one’s resolve is called wholeness.

**Annotation:** Inner self-possession.

**Subcommentary:** *Cuo* means to bend. Undisturbed by praise or blame, unmoved by glory or disgrace, not allowing worldly things to bend one’s integrity—such virtue is complete.

When the noble person is enlightened regarding these ten, then their mind is vast in its capacity for affairs.

**Annotation:** With a vast mind, no affair is unaccommodated.

**Subcommentary:** *Tao* means to encompass. When the noble person, in praising others, freely applies these ten principles to themselves, they can embrace all affairs, and their mind and nature become magnanimous.

Their virtue flows abundantly, and the myriad things come to them.

**Annotation:** Virtue’s blessings overflow, allowing the myriad things to go their own way.

**Subcommentary:** *Shi* means to go. With a mind and nature at ease, virtue’s blessings overflow, hence all living beings turn toward them.

Thus, one hides gold in the mountains and pearls in the depths.

**Annotation:** Not valuing rare and precious things.

**Subcommentary:** Acting as described above is acting without action. Not coveting glory and splendor, one does not prize treasures or goods. Thus, pearls born in water need not be sought, for they are naturally stored in the depths; gold issuing from mountains need not be pursued, for it is naturally concealed in the peaks.

One does not profit from goods or wealth.

**Annotation:** One can forget the self—how much more, then, goods and wealth?

**Subcommentary:** Though one may obtain pearls and jade, one does not consume them to sustain the body. How much less would one use goods and wealth for profit?

One does not draw near to nobility or riches.

**Annotation:** They come and go as guests; the heart always keeps them at a distance.

**Subcommentary:** Coming and going as guests, neither grieving nor rejoicing, one externally distances oneself from high rank and chariots, and internally does not draw near to wealth and nobility.

One does not delight in long life, nor grieve over early death.

**Annotation:** This is what is called "suspended liberation."

**Subcommentary:** Even if one’s years are long, one does not take joy in it; if one’s life is cut short, one does not grieve. One does not glory in success, nor feel shame in poverty.

**Annotation:** Forgetting life and death in the heart—how much more, then, the space between poverty and success?

**Subcommentary:** Wealth, nobility, glory, and success—one does not take them as glory. Lowliness, poverty, obstruction, and blockage—one does not take them as shame. Neither long life nor early death ever occupy one’s thoughts; how could the feelings of glory and shame find a place in the heart?

One does not confine the world’s benefits to one’s private share.

**Annotation:** All is entrusted to the myriad things.

**Subcommentary:** Illuminating the cosmos, governing all under Heaven, with the treasures of the Four Seas all under one’s sway—yet one does not profit from goods or wealth, entrusting them to the myriad states. How could one confine them for private use?

He does not take ruling all under Heaven as his own exalted position.

**Annotation:** Suddenly, one is unaware of glory residing in oneself.

**Subcommentary:** Encompassing all the black-haired people, governing all under Heaven, yet one attributes merit to things, forgetting one’s own wealth and nobility—thus one does not take oneself as great and exalted. Exalted means manifest.

**Annotation:** If not exalted, then silent and still.

**Subcommentary:** Manifest means to make evident. Though seated in Fen-yang, having lost all under Heaven, still one’s wisdom shines forth—how could one say it is concealed light? The myriad things are a single treasury; death and life share the same form.

**Annotation:** Like a cicada’s molting, nowhere to be found.

**Subcommentary:** Forgetting self and others, thus the myriad things may be as one treasury; obscured to transformation, thus death and life share the same form. If death and life bring no change to oneself, how much less the space between poverty and success?

The Master said: The Dao—profound is its abode, floating is its purity.

**Subcommentary:** The utmost principle is profoundly mysterious, like the abyss of the sea; limpid and pure, it illumines even the temples and brows. Profound, one sighs at its abode’s stillness and deep clarity; floating, one sighs that though in motion, it remains unsullied. Originally, this also wrote the character for "lord."

Metal and stone cannot sound without being struck.

**Annotation:** Sound arises from stillness.

**Subcommentary:** Sound arises from stillness; response arises from the real. Thus metal and stone have voices, but if not struck, they do not sound.

**Annotation:** This is used to illustrate that one who embodies the Dao responds only after things move.

**Subcommentary:** *Kao-gong* means to strike. Within metal and stone, the notes of the *gong* and *shang* scales lie dormant; if not struck, they will never produce sound. Likewise, the heart of the perfected person truly holds sagely virtue, yet if things do not move it, there is no way for response to appear. Earlier, the abyss of water was invoked to clarify the utmost Dao; here, metal and stone are used to reveal the sagely heart. Which among the myriad things can fix it?

**Annotation:** Response and stimulus have no fixed direction.

**Subcommentary:** It is like a bright mirror or an empty valley: things come, and it responds, responding yet without intent. Since things are endless in their long and short, responses are likewise boundless in their square and round. The person of royal virtue, holding fast to simplicity, feels shame at becoming entangled in affairs.

**Annotation:** One follows simplicity and moves on—it is not that one delights in becoming entangled in affairs.

**Subcommentary:** *Su* means real; *shi* means to go. The royal one, neither arrogant nor self-important, follows the real and moves on. Embracing simplicity in lofty purity, one feels shame at becoming entangled in worldly affairs. One establishes the root and origin, and knows how to penetrate the divine.

**Annotation:** With the root established, one knows not to go against it.

**Subcommentary:** The divine is the unfathomable function. Always abiding in principle, one moves and responds to things. The unfathomable divine knows how to penetrate things—this wondrous function must rely on the root. This is to show that the root can give rise to function, and function does not depart from the root’s meaning. Thus one’s virtue is vast.

**Annotation:** Following simplicity to penetrate the divine, only then does it become boundless.

**Subcommentary:** To be pure and without action, to follow the real and move on, to know the divine and penetrate things, yet always establish the root and origin—function does not depart from substance, movement does not harm stillness. With virtue like this, how could one not be the greatest and most central? When one’s heart issues forth, things seek it out.

**Annotation:** Things seek it out, and only then does it issue forth—not that it precedes things in singing.

**Subcommentary:** To seek is to request. The utmost sage, empty of self, responds to things and the self; if things do not seek sagely virtue, there is no way for the sagely heart to issue forth. The issuing of the sagely heart truly comes from things seeking it. One desires harmony yet does not sing, does not precede things. Thus form does not arise without the Dao; life does not become manifest without virtue.

**Subcommentary:** Form is the seven-foot body; life is the hundred-year span; virtue is the power of clarity and wisdom; the Dao is the realm that can be penetrated. The Dao can penetrate and give life to the myriad things, thus without the Dao there is no life; virtue can illumine the root of principle, thus without virtue there is no manifestation. The *Laozi* says: "The Dao gives birth to them, virtue rears them." To preserve form and exhaust life, to establish virtue and illumine the Dao—is this not the royal virtue?

**Subcommentary:** *Cun* means to follow; *qiong* means to exhaust. To follow the beauty or ugliness of form, to exhaust the long or short of life, to establish great virtue to guide the times, to use the utmost Dao to penetrate things—who but the royal virtue can do this? Vast and boundless, suddenly it issues forth, suddenly it moves, and the myriad things follow it. This is called the person of royal virtue.

**Annotation:** *Hu* and *bo* both describe the manner of responding without intent. Movement and issuing forth are without intent, thus the myriad things follow—this is the vast and boundless. Thus one can preserve form and exhaust life, establish virtue and illumine the Dao, and so become the royal virtue.

**Subcommentary:** *Dangdang* is the name for broad and level. *Hu* and *bo* describe the manner of being without intent. Moved by things, it issues forth in accord with the moment, following and yielding to things—thus things follow it. Possessing all excellences, it is called the royal virtue. Gazing into the darkness, listening to the silent. The utmost Dao is profoundly mysterious, the sagely heart is congealed and still—without form, it cannot be seen by the eyes; without sound, it cannot be heard by the ears. Within the darkness, one alone sees the dawn; within the silence, one alone hears the harmony.

**Annotation:** As for seeing and hearing, if one does not entrust them to stillness, then there will be convergence and obscurity, not harmony.

**Subcommentary:** Though the darkness is without form, it can shape the myriad images; though the silence is without sound, it can harmonize the eight tones. This is to clarify that from substance arises function, and such is its power. Thus the deeper it is, the deeper it can give form to things.

**Annotation:** Only by exhausting the source can one give form to things.

**Subcommentary:** Neither being nor non-being, neither stillness nor response—dispelling again and again, thus the deeper it is, the deeper. Having exhausted principle and fully realized nature, thus one can give form to the myriad things. The more divine it is, the more divine, and thus it can be refined.

**Annotation:** Only by reaching the utmost compliance can one fully realize the wondrous.

**Subcommentary:** "Spirit" is the name for the unfathomable. Response and stillness are mutually entailed; being and non-being are thoroughly penetrated. Yet it is neither fathomable nor unfathomable, nor even "not unfathomable"—such is the subtlety of spirit. Thus, in its interaction with the myriad things, it is utterly formless yet fulfills all demands.

**Annotation:** When I am thus steadfast and wholly yield to them, their demands are met of themselves.

**Subcommentary:** Dispelling again and again, this is called "utter formlessness." In engaging with things, it has no fixed method; adapting to conditions, it accords with what is fitting. Though the ten thousand kinds differ in a thousand ways, whatever is sought is supplied—like a mirror hung high in the hall, reflecting whatever comes before it. At times it gallops forth to meet their long-standing, great or small, long or short, distant or near needs.

**Annotation:** All are indulged and allowed free rein, converging only at their utmost limit.

**Subcommentary:** Gallop means to release; *su* means to converge. Only by embodying utter formlessness can it adapt to demands as they arise. Thus it can follow the times, respond to things in manifold ways, and converge without clinging to any one path. Whether great or small, now short, now long, even to the distant—whatever comes, it meets the needs of each condition, supplying what is sought. Like prescribing medicine for illness, its principle is never amiss.

The Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Water, ascended the Kunlun heights, and gazed south. Upon returning, he lost his dark pearl.

**Annotation:** This illustrates the means by which the true is attained.

**Subcommentary:** Red is the color of the south, and the heart is the viscera of the south. Water’s nature is to flow, and its position is in the north. This is like a deluded heart and a tarnished mirror, which together reflect nothing—hence "north of the Red Water." Kunlun is the body; south is the direction of brightness; *wang* means to observe; *xuan* denotes what is remote; and the pearl is a precious treasure. This shows that the world’s myriad beings, without exception, are deluded in body and mind. Racing and indulging in desires, they lack all awareness—akin to the north, flowing like water, losing the true and forfeiting the Way. This is the reason. Now, to return to the root and restore the source, to analyze the true and seek the Way, one gazes south to demonstrate discernment, and "returns" to signify the recovery of destiny. Thus, the text first clarifies where the true is lost, then reveals the means to attain the Way. The method it illustrates is set forth below.

It is such that when one seeks it, one cannot obtain it.

**Annotation:** This means that the use of knowledge is insufficient to attain the true.

**Subcommentary:** *Suo* means to seek. Thus, one must sever thought and cannot seek with the heart.

Even Li Zhu could not obtain it by seeking.

**Subcommentary:** It is not form, so it cannot be grasped by the eye.

Nor could Chi Gou obtain it by seeking.

**Annotation:** Though keen of hearing and sharp of speech, the more one relies on them, the farther one strays from the true.

**Subcommentary:** Chi Gou refers to eloquence. It cannot be sought through words.

Only Xiangwang obtained it.

**Subcommentary:** *Wangxiang* means "without heart." Abandoning sound and form, severing thought, wisdom and Li Zhu turn back in exhaustion, while Chi Gou’s eloquence, exerting effort, loses the true. Only Xiangwang, being without heart, alone attains the dark pearl.

The Yellow Emperor said: How extraordinary! Could Xiangwang truly obtain it?

**Annotation:** This clarifies that attaining the true does not rely on the use of the heart. Being like Xiangwang is to be the true itself.

**Subcommentary:** Li Lou lost his nature by relying on his keen eyesight and thus forfeited the Way. The Yellow Emperor, awakening to principle, marveled that Xiangwang obtained the pearl. Exhorting his disciples, he showed that one need not depart from form or abandon wisdom, but only dim one’s hearing and rest in the body.

Yao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; and Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi.

**Subcommentary:** The four men above were all recluses of Yao’s time. Disgusted by the world’s filth, they embraced the Way and held to virtue, keeping themselves pure and unsullied, refusing to partake in worldly affairs. Yao, knowing their worth, wished to yield the throne to them. Zhuangzi demonstrated their succession, thus listing their teacher-student lineage.

Yao asked Xu You: Could Nie Que be fit to match Heaven?

**Annotation:** That is, to be the Son of Heaven.

I would rely on Wang Ni to summon him.

**Annotation:** He wished to use his teacher to summon and employ him.

**Subcommentary:** *Pei* means to match; *jie* means to rely on. Yao said: Nie Que’s worthiness is such that his virtue matches Heaven’s position. Perhaps by relying on Wang Ni, he could be persuaded to take the throne. The circumstances were out of order, so he asked Xu You.

Xu You said: How perilous it would be to endanger the world by employing Nie Que!

**Annotation:** *Ji* means peril.

**Subcommentary:** *Dai* means near; *ji* means peril. If one were to summon Nie Que to yield the realm of ten thousand chariots, the signs of peril and ruin would not be far off. Nie Que’s nature is such that his intelligence and acuity surpass others.

**Annotation:** Being overly intelligent and quick surpasses others, which would lead people to tread upon him, repeatedly harming the people.

**Subcommentary:** *Huan* means sagacity; *gei* means agility; *min* means swiftness. The sage who governs the world wears a cap with pendants that hang before his eyes and cords that plug his ears, thereby blocking keen perception and avoiding excessive hearing and seeing. Yet Nie Que inwardly harbors sagacity and intelligence, outwardly dazzles with keen perception, wields a sharp tongue, and excels in calculation. His virtue, conduct, and nature surpass others; his reputation is already manifest, and thus he would surely be harmed. The signs of peril and ruin are listed below.

Moreover, he would use man to match Heaven.

**Annotation:** Employing knowledge to seek to restore its natural state.

**Subcommentary:** The loss of the true in things has endured for a long time. Using the devices of the heart and mind to restore their original state thus strays far from natural nature.

He is keen to prohibit transgressions yet does not know whence transgressions arise.

**Annotation:** Transgressions arise from keen intelligence, yet he would employ intelligence to prohibit them—his transgressions would only grow worse. Thus it is said: There is no transgression in eliminating knowledge; it does not lie in forced prohibition.

**Subcommentary:** The source from which transgressions arise is knowledge.

Qiè Qué merely knows to scrutinize and prohibit the transgressions of the common people, yet does not understand that the cessation of transgressions arises from the elimination of knowledge. Could one thus match him with Heaven?

He would ride upon man and be without Heaven.
**Annotation:** If one were to entrust him with the world, he would only lead later generations to employ knowledge and lose the true.
**Subcommentary:** If granted the throne to govern the people, he would wield the mechanisms of the heart and mind, delighting in heavenly principles, causing all things to lose their inherent nature and no longer possess their natural state.

He would take his own body as the root and make forms different.
**Annotation:** If one takes the myriad things as the root, then transformations may be unified and differing forms may be made the same.
**Subcommentary:** He would act thus: Qiè Qué, taking his own body as the root, would draw things to himself, compelling the world’s diverse forms to follow his transformations. The loss of things’ inherent nature would stem from this, and the calamities of later generations would begin here.

He would exalt knowledge and race like fire.
**Annotation:** When the worthy occupy positions of precedence, knowledge and perception are exalted thereafter, and the pursuit of gain races like fire.
**Subcommentary:** Unable to forget knowledge and entrust things to their own course, he would exalt knowledge to govern the world, thereby fostering competition, emulating others, and racing in pursuit—swift as fire.

He would become the initiator of toil.
**Annotation:** He would open the path for the affairs and labors of later generations.
**Subcommentary:** *Xù* means "beginning"; *shǐ* means "toil." Unable to practice non-action and instead employing knowledge to govern things, the toil of later generations would originate from this.

He would become the shackle of things.
**Annotation:** He would thereby cause later generations to be constrained and controlled by things.
**Subcommentary:** *Ài* means "to hinder." Unable to employ the Dao to harmonize people, he would instead rely on knowledge to shackle things.

He would look in all four directions and have things respond.
**Annotation:** He would thereby cause later generations to command and move things, making them respond to his demands.
**Subcommentary:** He would look in all four directions, pacifying the myriad states, causing the common people to respond to his transformative laws.

He would respond to the needs of the multitude.
**Annotation:** He would thereby cause later generations to be unable to forget goodness, employing benevolence and righteousness to meet needs.
**Subcommentary:** Using his own knowledge to respond to the needs of the multitude, lacking a mind of non-action, he would not escape peril.

He would transform along with things.
**Annotation:** He would thereby cause later generations to chase after things and be unable to attain inner self-realization.
**Subcommentary:** He would apply his own knowledge to the multitude of things, compelling them to follow his transformations. Having lost their inherent nature, neither things nor he himself would attain it.

And he would never attain constancy.
**Annotation:** All these are expedient measures for the moment, yet today one receives their benefits, while tomorrow one bears their harms. Thus it is said: he would never attain constancy.
**Subcommentary:** Governing things with knowledge, policies issue from many sources. One may bear their benefits first, only to suffer their harms later. Having departed from the simplicity of antiquity, there is no constancy.

How could he be worthy to match Heaven?

Yet though this be so, he has his kind and his forebears.
**Annotation:** His deeds may be traced to forebears and emulated.
**Subcommentary:** *Zú* means "gathering place." Qiè Qué dwells in seclusion among the mountains, upholding lofty aspirations. Unable to blend with the world, he is unfit to match Heaven. Yet among the common people, his kind is rare. Thus his aspirations and purity may indeed be emulated.

He may serve as the father of the multitude, but he cannot serve as the father of fathers.
**Annotation:** The father of fathers is he who transmits the legacy.
**Subcommentary:** *Fù* means "ruler." Qiè Qué, lofty and non-active, does not level himself with the common. Though his Dao may be followed, he is fit only to be the father of the multitude, not the father of fathers. The father of fathers is Yao. Yao sat enthroned above the myriad things, yet his heart roamed to Mount Gūyè, where he visited the Four Masters in the land of Fényáng. Thus, in stillness he acted, in action he was still; non-action became action, action became non-action. Being and non-being were simultaneous, movement and stillness were one. Therefore, he could be the ruler among rulers, the father among fathers. He was one who exhausted principle and fulfilled nature, entering ever deeper into the mysterious, and thus was the father of all living beings. As Guo’s annotation says: "The father of fathers is he who advances."

Order and chaos alike take him as their leader.
**Annotation:** He is not merely the lord of order, but also the leader of chaos.
**Subcommentary:** *Shuài* means "leader." If one employs knowledge to govern things, though order may prevail at the time, chaos will follow. Both paths take knowledge as their leader.

He is the calamity of those who face north.
**Annotation:** Jie and Zhou were not themselves able to kill worthy ministers; they relied on the path of sagely knowledge to bring them to ruin.
**Subcommentary:** Jie and Zhou relied on sagely knowledge to kill worthy ministers; thus, sagely knowledge is the calamity of those who face north.

He is the thief of those who face south.
**Annotation:** Tian Heng was not himself able to kill his lord; he relied on benevolence and righteousness to steal his throne.
**Subcommentary:** Tian Chang relied on benevolence and righteousness to kill his lord; thus, benevolence and righteousness are the thieves of those who face south. The annotation states: "Tian Chang was not himself able to kill his lord; he relied on benevolence and righteousness to steal his throne."

Yao observed Hua. The border guard of Hua said: "Ah! Sage! I pray to bless the sage." He wished the sage long life. Yao declined. He wished the sage wealth. Yao declined. He wished the sage many sons. Yao declined.
**Subcommentary:** Wealth, longevity, and many sons are indeed burdensome entanglements, yet one who embodies them may abandon non-action. Thus, by alluding to these two men, he clarifies these three refusals.

The purport of refusal and yielding is expounded below.

The border guard said: "Longevity, wealth, and many sons—these are what all men desire. Why do you alone not desire them?"

**Subcommentary:** The three things mentioned earlier are the greatest desires of men. Why do you alone refuse them? What is your meaning?

Yao said: "Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; longevity brings many humiliations. These three are not what nurture virtue, so I refuse them."

**Subcommentary:** When sons are numerous, worries and fears multiply; when wealth abounds, affairs become burdensome; when life is long, humiliations accumulate. These three do not nourish the virtue of non-action but only increase the entanglements of action, so I refuse them all.

The border guard said: "At first, I took you for a sage, but now you are merely a gentleman."

**Subcommentary:** I thought you possessed unparalleled illumination and embodied the Dao as a sage, but now, having abandoned the pursuit of such things, you are only a worthy gentleman.

"Heaven generates the myriad people and must assign them duties. If you have many sons and assign them duties, what fear is there?"

**Annotation:** All things find their proper place, and their wills are settled.

**Subcommentary:** Heaven and Earth create all things, each with its own abilities. When offices are assigned according to talent, what cause for fear is there?

"If you are wealthy and distribute it among others, what affairs remain?"

**Annotation:** Entrust it to all under Heaven, and there are no affairs.

**Subcommentary:** When the people are prosperous and the Four Seas are abundant, entrusting wealth to all without claiming it as private, affairs become non-action.

"The sage dwells like a quail,

**Annotation:** Without intention, he awaits tranquility.

and eats like a fledgling,

**Annotation:** He relies on things to be sufficient.

**Subcommentary:** The quail is a bird that dwells in the wild without fixed abode. The fledgling, a young crow, is fed by its mother and thus has enough. The sage’s dwelling is simple, like the quail’s; his sustenance is modest, like the fledgling’s. Having no heart for extravagance, how could he have a taste for rich flavors?

"He moves like a bird, leaving no trace.

**Annotation:** He follows his nature in movement, not advancing by force.

**Subcommentary:** *Zhāng* means patterned tracks. The sage extinguishes his heart and erases his knowledge, merging with things in obscurity, like a bird in flight—visible yet leaving no trace.

When the world follows the Dao, all things flourish with him.

**Annotation:** He wanders wildly and recklessly, yet naturally treads the great path.

**Subcommentary:** When the age is governed by clarity, he rules over the multitudes; when things come to him, he responds, and all flourishes in due time. Guo’s annotation speaks of "wandering wildly and recklessly," but this seems contrary to the text’s meaning.

When the world loses the Dao, he cultivates virtue and retreats into seclusion.

**Annotation:** Even the affairs of Tang and Wu, if they accord with Heaven and respond to the people, are not without their proper place. Thus, "non-action yet nothing left undone" does not mean inaction.

**Subcommentary:** *Xián* (seclusion) is pronounced like *xián* (leisure). In times of chaos, he blends with the common and conceals his brilliance, cultivating virtue in obscurity to preserve his life’s Dao, dwelling in leisure and wandering in reclusion. This is what is meant by "adapting to presence or absence, acting or resting as the time demands."

After a thousand years, he wearies of the world and departs to become an immortal above.

**Annotation:** The utmost person exhausts the length of life and masters the transformations of principle. In life, he follows Heaven’s course; in death, he becomes one with things. Thus, it is said he wearies of the world and ascends as an immortal.

**Subcommentary:** The sage comprehends the non-duality of life and death and the unity of transformation. Thus, he fulfills the span of his years, whether long or short, and wearies of the world’s clamor to ascend in dissolution. Why single out the ascent at Mount Dinghu as the only path to immortality? The longevity of Anqi is said to span a thousand years.

He rides the white clouds to reach the Emperor’s realm.

**Annotation:** When qi disperses, there is nowhere it does not go.

**Subcommentary:** His spirit ascends, merging with the Great One, riding clouds and mounting qi to arrive at the realm of the Heavenly Emperor.

The three afflictions do not reach him, and his person remains free from misfortune. What humiliation could there be?

**Subcommentary:** The three afflictions are the earlier mentioned wealth, longevity, and many sons. Riding the Creator and coming and going, mounting transformation and wandering freely, the three afflictions are fundamentally empty, and the seven-foot body arises from non-being. What misfortune or humiliation could there be?

The border guard departed. Yao followed him, saying: "I beg to ask."

**Subcommentary:** Having heard enough, the border guard then left. Yao, now awakened to his error, sought an answer.

The border guard said: "Withdraw."

**Subcommentary:** Your doubts are resolved; you should quickly withdraw.

Yao governed the world, and Bo Cheng Zi Gao was established as a feudal lord. When Yao abdicated to Shun, and Shun to Yu, Bo Cheng Zi Gao resigned his lordship to farm.

**Subcommentary:** Bo Cheng Zi Gao—it is not known from where he came, but he was likely a man of the Dao. Yu went to see him, finding him plowing in the fields. Yu hastened to the downwind side, stood, and asked: "In the past, when Yao governed the world, you were established as a feudal lord. When Yao abdicated to Shun, and Shun to me, you resigned your lordship to farm. I venture to ask: what is the reason?"

**Subcommentary:** In the age of Yao and Shun, the throne was transmitted to the worthy; yet in the Xia dynasty, he retreated to farm in the wild. His conduct diverged so sharply—what was his intention?

Bo Cheng Zi Gao said: "In the past, when Yao governed the world, he did not reward, yet the people were encouraged; he did not punish, yet the people were in awe."

**Subcommentary:** Rewards and punishments are meant to manifest encouragement and awe. Yet Yao governed through non-action, and all things followed his transformation. Thus, the people did not wait for his commendation to exert themselves in goodness, nor did they require punishment to fear doing evil. This reveals his sagely illumination and virtue.

When you now reward and punish, the people lack benevolence. Virtue has thus declined, punishments have thus been established, and the chaos of later ages begins here.

**Subcommentary:** Even with rewards and punishments in full force, the people still lack benevolence. With the highest virtue in decline, penal laws proliferate. Thus, the chaos of future ages begins here.

Should you, Master, not depart? Let not my work be abandoned. He plowed steadily, heedless of all else.

**Annotation:** In the time of Yu, the Three Sages succeeded one another, their governance perfected and virtue complete. Yet as their achievements and beauty gradually receded, historical records left no trace, and even Confucius could not inquire into them. Thus, though Yu held the world, he did not partake in it—this was having yet not having. Examining the era, Yu was the most excellent; assessing the men, though three sages, they were as one with Yao. With no sage in the age, the world’s heart swiftly turned to Qi. Yet he who embodies perfect impartiality and occupies the right moment entrusts the world to the people, taking and giving without attachment. Thus, he does not seek what is lost nor refuse what is gained, but comes and goes with serene indifference. For this, he is neither praised by the upright nor blamed by the critical, and his name ranks among the Three Kings—no wonder. Zhuangzi uses this to reveal Yao’s flaws, for the flaw began with Yao and the breach was completed by Yu. How much worse for later ages without sages? He entrusts this distant account to Zigao, urging him to abandon governance, seeking to abolish sageliness and return to unity, to discard knowledge and attain tranquility. Yet in truth, this was never heard.

Zhuangzi’s words cannot be confined to a single interpretation. Some trace the Yellow Emperor’s teachings to Yao and Shun’s classics—how could he alone exalt Yao and belittle Yu? Thus, one must set aside his allusions and grasp his intent to abolish sageliness and discard knowledge.

**Subcommentary:** Why do you not depart? *Luo* means to abandon. *Lǚlǚ* describes the appearance of plowing. Bocheng addressed Yu as "Master." "Master, why do you not leave?" "Do not abandon my farming." Thus, he plowed with all his strength, no longer glancing back.

The Three Sages succeeded one another, with no distinction in excellence; only the purity or turbidity of their ages differed, hence their achievements varied. Guo’s annotation—"the flaw began with Yao and the breach was completed by Yu"—aims to show that having sages is inferior to having none, and action is not equal to non-action. Thus, he advances a lofty argument to clarify the abolition of sageliness and the rejection of knowledge.

In the Great Beginning, there was non-being, and non-being had no name.

**Annotation:** There was no being, thus nothing to name.

**Subcommentary:** *Tai* means great; *chu* means beginning. When qi first stirred, it was called the Great Beginning, for its vastness made it the origin of all things. At the Great Beginning, there was only non-being, not yet being. With being not yet arisen, where could it reside? Thus, there was non-being and no name.

From the arising of the One, there was the One, yet no form.

**Annotation:** The One is the beginning of being, the most wondrous. Being most wondrous, it had no physical principle or form. The arising of the One arises from the utmost One, not from non-being. Yet why does Zhuangzi repeatedly speak of non-being at the beginning? The beginning is that which has not yet been born but attains birth—the difficulty of attaining birth. Yet it neither relies on non-being above nor depends on knowledge below, but suddenly and spontaneously attains this birth. Why then strive for life after birth and lose its natural birth?

**Subcommentary:** The One corresponds to the Dao, having the name of the One but not the appearance of the myriad things. When things attain it to be born, it is called virtue.

**Annotation:** Non-being cannot generate things. To say "things attain it to be born" is to clarify that things are born of their own attainment. Allowing their self-attainment is what may be called virtue.

**Subcommentary:** Virtue means attainment, referring to this attainment. When things attain birth, they do not rely on externals nor depend on the self; neither non-being nor being, neither self nor other, they do not know how they are born—thus it is called virtue.

Before form, there were distinctions, and this was so without inquiry—this is called destiny.

**Subcommentary:** Though form had not yet taken shape, the essence to receive form already existed. Yet this essence’s length or brevity was without gap or inquiry—thus it is called destiny.

Stillness and movement give birth to things. When things are completed and the principle of life is established, this is called form.

**Subcommentary:** Stillness is tranquility. Yang moves, yin is still; their ascent and descent intermingle, distributing across the Three Powers and transforming to give birth to the myriad things. When things are completed and the principle of life is fully established, this is called form.

When form embodies spirit, each has its proper pattern—this is called nature.

**Annotation:** Virtue, form, nature, and destiny are names established through change, yet in their self-so, they are one.

**Subcommentary:** *Ti* means substance; *bao* means to preserve. Having received form and substance, they preserve their spirit. Form may be ugly or beautiful, spirit may be foolish or wise. Yet each follows its proper pattern, all different. Once the essence is fixed, it does not change—thus it is called nature.

When nature is cultivated and returns to virtue, virtue reaches the same as the beginning.

**Annotation:** Always self-attaining without action.

**Subcommentary:** Following this endowed nature and returning to the virtue of life’s beginning, when virtue reaches this point, it is the same as the Great Beginning.

Sameness is emptiness; emptiness is greatness.

**Annotation:** If not the same as the beginning and midway employing action, then what is held within is still something. With something, the virtue of nurturing is diminished.

**Subcommentary:** Sameness with the Great Beginning makes the mind empty and vast. With the mind empty and open, it can embrace greatness.

Harmonizing with the cries of birds,

**Annotation:** Speaking without intention to speak, harmonizing with the cries of birds.

**Subcommentary:** *Hui* means bird. With the mind empty and open, it returns to the true thing. Thus, its words harmonize with the cries of birds. The cries of birds have no intention of right or wrong; how could the sage’s words have attachment to love or hate?

Harmonizing with the cries, it unites with heaven and earth.

**Annotation:** Heaven and earth also move without intention.

**Subcommentary:** Words harmonizing with the cries of birds, virtue also harmonizes with heaven and earth. Heaven and earth have no intention in their covering and supporting; the sage has no intention in his words—thus he unites with heaven and earth.

Its harmony is seamless, as if foolish, as if dull.

**Annotation:** It harmonizes by sitting in forgetfulness, not by deliberate examination.

**Subcommentary:** *Jin* means to unite. The sage inwardly accords with the highest principle, outwardly follows the constant course of life, ever merging with the root—utterly without discord. Thus it is called seamless. Blending with the world’s currents, moving with the dust of myriad things, he appears foolish and dull.

Another interpretation: Harmonizing with the cries of birds and with heaven and earth—this too is seamless.

This is called profound virtue, aligning with the Great Compliance.

**Annotation:** The virtue is profound, and that which it complies with is vast.

**Subcommentary:** Summing up the foregoing, it extols this flourishing excellence. Such a person may be said to possess the most profound virtue, thus aligning with the Great Beginning and complying with all under heaven.

Confucius asked Lao Dan: “There is one who governs the Way as if imitating others—affirming the unconfirmable, assenting to the unassentable.

**Annotation:** To imitate others by forcing the unconfirmable into confirmation, the unassentable into assent—this is to distort one’s nature and feelings.

**Subcommentary:** The master sought Lao Dan’s counsel on every matter. Speaking generally without precision, he said, “There is one.” In administering governance, he makes others emulate him, imposing his own standards upon things, causing them to lose their nature. Thus what he affirms, others may deny; what he assents to, others may dissent. And what others affirm or assent to may likewise differ for him.

A disputant once said: “Separating hardness and whiteness is like hanging them in the void.”

**Annotation:** This means it is lofty and manifest, easily seen.

**Subcommentary:** Hardness and whiteness refer to Gongsun Long’s *Discourse on the White Horse*. Kong Chuan and his followers rigidly upheld this doctrine, unmatched in their time. Now the disputant claims: “I can dissect the argument on hardness and whiteness, not entangling them, making the distinction as clear as the sun and moon suspended in the sky.” Thus Guo’s annotation says it is lofty and manifest, easily seen.

Can such a one be called a sage?

**Subcommentary:** This concludes the preceding question. Can such a person be considered a sage?

Lao Dan replied: “This is but a clerk exchanging skills, ensnaring the body, wearying the form, and exhausting the mind.

**Subcommentary:** *Xu* means mutual. Such a one exchanges and seizes with assertions and negations, binding himself with these skills, thus wearing out his body and alarming his mind. This answers the earlier question. Some texts write *zhi* (branch) instead of *ji* (skill), meaning that assertions and negations branch and diverge like leaves.

The hound trained to catch foxes grows anxious; the nimble monkey is brought down from the mountain forests.

**Annotation:** Both have lost their natural state.

**Subcommentary:** A *nuan ju* is a macaque. The hound that seizes foxes often suffers a broken neck in the hunt, and thus, no longer at ease, grows anxious. The monkey, dwelling in the mountains and roaming freely, is swift and agile—yet loses its natural abode. Some texts write *mao* (cat) instead of *li* (fox), referring to the bamboo rat.

I tell you what you cannot hear and speak of what you cannot utter. Of all things with heads and feet but without minds or ears, there are many.

**Annotation:** Heads and feet refer to beginnings and ends. Without minds or ears means they transform of themselves.

**Subcommentary:** *Ruò* and *ér* both mean “you.” Heads and feet signify beginnings and ends. The principle transcends speech, so it cannot be heard or spoken. Nor can it be known by the mind or heard by the ear—hence the phrase “without minds or ears.” All things with mechanisms but no true nature have beginnings and ends, thus they are many. None can be explained in words, nor fully grasped by the mind. Why then do you boast of the monkey’s skill or exalt distinctions as lofty as the sun and moon? If things imitate you, is this not excessive?

That which has form and that which is formless and shapeless—both cannot endure together.

**Annotation:** What has form is ever-changing and cannot coexist with the formless and shapeless.

Thus one who skillfully governs the Way does not cling to the old but follows the daily renewal of transformation.

**Subcommentary:** That which has form is the body; the formless is the mind. You claim both mind and body endure, but in observing principle, I see they are entirely empty.

Its movement is rest; its death is life; its decline is rise. This is not its *suoyi*.

**Annotation:** Movement and rest, death and life, flourishing and decline, rise and fall—none have constancy. All arise naturally, not by any deliberate means. Thus, when released, they find their own accord.

**Subcommentary:** At times there is movement, at times rest; things die and are born; affairs rise and fall. These six states follow natural principle, yet their cause is unknown. How could they depend on human thought or imitative governance? Simply follow and comply—things will find their proper place.

Governance lies in the people,

**Annotation:** Not in the ruler’s self-assertion.

**Subcommentary:** Each person acts according to their nature, the heavenly mechanism unfolding of itself—not by the ruler’s instruction.

Forgetting things, forgetting heaven—this is called forgetting oneself.

**Annotation:** When things and heaven are both forgotten, what remains besides oneself?

**Subcommentary:** Not only are worldly affairs empty, but even heavenly principle is non-existent. When both affairs and principle are forgotten, one attains the ultimate of neither being nor non-being.

One who forgets oneself is said to enter into heaven.

**Annotation:** What one cannot forget is oneself. If even this is forgotten, what remains to be known? This is to be obscurely one with the natural.

**Subcommentary:** Entering means merging. The most difficult thing to forget is oneself, yet if even this can be forgotten, what in the world remains? Thus, when self and things are both forgotten, one merges obscurely with the Dao of nature.

Jiang Qiao Ao saw Ji Che and said: “The Lord of Lu said to Fan: ‘I beg to receive your instruction.’”

Refusing proved impossible, and having already imparted my counsel, I know not whether it strikes the mark—allow me to offer it for trial.

**Subcommentary:** *Offer* means to present. Jiang Qiao and Ji are surnames. Mian is Ji Che’s given name. These two worthies’ origins remain unknown, their records undetailed. The Lord of Lu refers to the Marquis of Lu, descendant of Bo Qin, though which duke is uncertain. When the Lord of Lu met Qiao, he requested instruction on governing the state. Though Qiao declined, he could not escape his lord’s command and thus expounded the Way of governance. At the time, leading the army, he feared his words might miss the mark and so dared to present what he had advised, testing it against the wisdom of the worthy. If the counsel proved unsuitable, he hoped for gentle correction.

I said to the Lord of Lu: “You must clothe yourself in reverence and frugality, promote those of public loyalty without partiality—then which of the people would dare not harmonize?”

**Subcommentary:** *Harmonize* is read as *gather*. *Partiality* means bias. *Which* means who. *Harmonize* means to unite. The Way of governance begins with embodying reverence and frugality, simplicity and restraint. Only then should one elevate those of impartial loyalty and upright integrity, selecting the worthy and dismissing the unfit to jointly govern the people. Thus, the borders will be secure, the realm tranquil, the people singing and striking the earth—who would dare not be at peace?

Ji Che laughed heartily and said: “If one follows your words, then in terms of the virtue of emperors and kings, it is like the mantis raising its arms in anger to block a chariot’s wheels—it will surely fail the task.”

**Annotation:** Clothing oneself in reverence and frugality is not frugality for frugality’s sake; promoting public loyalty is not loyalty for loyalty’s sake. Thus, though free of partiality, this is still insufficient to bear the burden of correcting deceit.

**Subcommentary:** *Heartily* describes the act of laughing while leaning forward. To be reverent and restrained, to promote public loyalty—these are all contrived sentiments, not the forgetfulness of the bland. To take such words as the virtue of one who faces south is no different from the mantis raising its arms to oppose a chariot’s wheels. Using the small to imitate the great, it cannot bear the task. Moreover, such an approach places oneself in peril, like an observation tower—

**Annotation:** All this is to place oneself on high, visible like a tower or terrace.

**Subcommentary:** Public frugality and public loyalty, being unable to forget the bland, merely serve to display oneself and dazzle the crowd. Once elevated to a precarious height, one will inevitably meet with ruin like a chariot’s collapse—just as a towering terrace, though visited by travelers, will not stand long. Many things will come—

**Annotation:** This is to compel things beyond their natural allotment, forcing them to multiply and attach themselves.

**Subcommentary:** The terrace stands high, and people compete to gaze upon it, their steps multiplying as they gather. The crowd rushes to its edges—

**Annotation:** Raising their feet to advance, they do not rest in their proper place.

**Subcommentary:** Dazzling things unsettles them, so they do not remain in their allotted place. Thus, many lift their feet to advance, standing on tiptoe.

Jiang Qiao, startled, said: “I am utterly confounded by your words.”

**Subcommentary:** *Startled* describes the appearance of shock. *Confounded* means to see nothing. Hearing such lofty discourse, he was suddenly alarmed, pondering without comprehension—hence his bewilderment.

“Nevertheless, I wish to hear the essence of your teaching.”

**Subcommentary:** *Teaching* means instruction. What I previously set forth was deeply contrary to principle. I wish to hear a single word that might serve as a model.

Ji Che said: “When the Great Sage governs the world, he sways the people’s hearts, shaping customs and transforming habits. He eradicates their harmful intentions and advances their solitary aspirations, as if by nature’s own doing, so that the people do not know why it is so.

**Annotation:** Each great aspiration has its own inclinations; they cannot be made uniform. Thus, following their natural sway, he sways them—yet though swayed, it is not by force. Following their natural drift, he drifts with them—yet though drifted, it is not by action. Thus, their harmful intentions naturally vanish, their solitary aspirations naturally advance. Customs are transformed, habits altered, all-pervasive and inescapable. They tread their nature and act of themselves, unaware of the cause, all saying, ‘It is simply our nature.’ *All* means every one.

**Subcommentary:** When the Sage governs the world, he greatly accords with the natural tendencies of living things. Riding their natural sway, he establishes laws; following their natural drift, he shapes teachings. Thus, though teachings are established, their traces are not apparent; though customs are transformed, the people do not know it. He eradicates their harmful intentions and advances their solitary aspirations. Unmoved by things, they act as if by nature’s own doing; following their nature, they do not know why it is so. *All* means every one.

If this is so, how could it be like Yao and Shun’s teaching of the people, revering them as elder brothers?

**Annotation:** *Revering* means holding in the highest esteem. He refuses to excessively praise Yao and Shun or defer to them as elder brothers.

**Subcommentary:** *Revering* means holding in the highest esteem. If one governs the people by the previous method, the realm will be as pure as antiquity, all things attaining their nature. Why must one uniquely revere Yao and Shun, deferring to them as elder brothers? This is to say that the customs of yielding and deference do not surpass those of Tang and Yu.

One desires to equal virtue, and the heart abides.

**Annotation:** *Abides* means not chasing after externals. If the heart does not abide, virtue will not be equal.

**Subcommentary:** *Abides* means to be settled. When the heart chases after externals, it clashes with things; when empty, tranquil, and settled, the myriad conditions become one. The sameness or difference of conditions lies in the stillness or disturbance of the heart. Thus, to desire to equal Yao and Shun in virtue, one must first settle the heart.

Zi Gong traveled south to Chu and, returning to Jin, passed by Hanyin. He saw an old man preparing his vegetable garden, digging a tunnel to enter the well, holding a jar to draw water and irrigate. He toiled greatly but achieved little.

**Subcommentary:** South of the water is called *yin*; growing vegetables is called a *garden*; the plots within are called *beds*.

The tunnel is an underground passage. *Huajiao* describes the appearance of exertion. *Zhangren* is a term of respect for an elder. Zi Gong traveled south into the lands of Jing and Chu, passing by the southern bank of the Han River, where he exchanged words with the elder. Their rising and falling tones and discourse are fully recorded in the text. Zhuangzi thus records these two worthies to illustrate the praise of Hundun.

Zi Gong said: "Here is a device that can irrigate a hundred vegetable beds in a single day. It requires little effort yet achieves much—would you not desire it?"

**Subcommentary:** *Xie* refers to machinery. Seeing the elder exert much effort for little result, Zi Gong taught him about mechanical devices, hoping to reduce labor while increasing efficiency. He offered his sincere advice, uncertain whether the elder would accept.

The gardener looked up and asked: "What is it like?"

Zi Gong replied: "Carve wood into a mechanism, heavy at the rear and light at the front. It draws water as if pulling, swift as boiling water—its name is the *shado*."

**Subcommentary:** The *ji* is a pivot. Drawing water with it is like pulling, its speed like bubbling water. Light at the front and heavy at the rear, it is what is now called the well-sweep.

The gardener flushed with anger, his expression turning to scornful laughter: "I have heard from my teacher that those who possess mechanical devices must have mechanical affairs, and those who have mechanical affairs must have a mechanical heart. When a mechanical heart resides in the breast, purity and whiteness are incomplete. When purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit is unsettled. One whose spirit is unsettled is not borne by the Dao. I am not ignorant of such things—I am ashamed to do them."

**Commentary:** What is used in its proper time is true completeness. This man, seeking to cultivate completeness, clings to oneness and upholds antiquity, yet loses his original simplicity.

**Subcommentary:** Those who possess mechanical devices must have mechanical tasks, and those who have mechanical tasks must have a mechanical mind. When a mechanical mind resides in the breast, pure whiteness is not fully realized. When pure whiteness is not fully realized, the spirit hangs in uncertainty, unsettled between life and death. One who is unsettled is not borne by the ultimate Dao, and thus I am ashamed to act thus. This man has not yet embodied true cultivation, so he clings to oneness and guards whiteness.

Zi Gong was abashed, his head bowed, unable to respond.

**Subcommentary:** *Man* describes the appearance of shame. Having failed in his words, he did not know how to answer.

After a while, the gardener asked: "What are you doing here?"

**Commentary:** *You jian* means a brief moment. *Xi* means "what." He asked Zi Gong: Whose disciple are you? What do you study?

Zi Gong replied: "I am a disciple of Confucius."

The gardener said: "Are you not that one who, with vast learning, compares himself to the sages, flatters and fawns to surpass the multitude, and strums a lone zither to sing mournful songs, selling your reputation throughout the world?"

**Subcommentary:** *Yu yu* refers to flattery. You boast of your broad learning and vast knowledge, comparing yourself to the sages. You twist your words with flattery to surpass ordinary people. You sit alone, strumming and singing, modulating your voice with sorrowful deceit. Clinging to the teachings of the sages, you sell your reputation, traveling through the states and journeying across the world.

"You should forget your spirit and qi, cast aside your form and bones—only then might you approach it."

**Commentary:** Without forgetting, without casting aside, there is no way to approach it.

**Subcommentary:** *Ji* means "near." You must forget your spirit and qi, abandon your body and form. Only when both body and heart are forgotten can you draw near to the Dao. Yet you cannot even govern yourself—how can you presume to govern the world? Be on your way and do not hinder my work."

**Subcommentary:** *Er* means "you." *Fa* means "to lack." Each thing governs itself, and thus the world is ordered. To govern others with oneself leads only to great disorder. With your virtue, Zi Gong, you are not yet fit to govern yourself—how could you answer the summons of the world? You should hasten on your way and not neglect my work.

Zi Gong shrank back, his color drained, feeling small and ill at ease. He walked thirty *li* before recovering.

**Subcommentary:** *Beizou* describes a momentary change in expression. *Xuxu* describes the appearance of self-doubt. Rebuked thus, his countenance lost its composure. Only after walking thirty *li* did he return to normal.

His disciples asked: "Who was that man just now? Why did you, Master, change your expression and lose your color upon seeing him, remaining unsettled for the rest of the day?"

**Subcommentary:** *Fan* means "to return." Zi Gong’s disciples referred to him as their Master. They asked: What art does that man practice, that upon seeing him, you, Master, lost your usual composure, your spirit unsettled for the entire day? The disciples, puzzled, thus questioned him.

Zi Gong replied: "At first, I thought there was only one man in the world—"

**Commentary:** He meant Confucius.

"—but I did not know there was another such man."

**Subcommentary:** Before, I received teachings believing that in the world, only my Master was peerless. Now, having met this elder, I see his virtue is even more profound and distant. Thus, I was momentarily abashed and could not regain my composure. Though I have not yet discerned the true from the false, I truly believed him to be as worthy as Confucius.

"I have heard from my Master that in affairs, one seeks what is fitting; in achievements, one seeks completion. Where little effort yields great results—that is the Way of the sage."

**Commentary:** The Way of the sage is simply to employ the hearts of the people.

**Subcommentary:** In affairs, what is timely is fitting; in achievements, what is accomplished is complete. Thus, where little effort yields great results, it is the mechanism of timely fitting and complete achievement. Zi Gong, confused by what he had heard before, took this to be the Way of the sage. But now it is not so. One who holds to the Dao has complete virtue; one with complete virtue has complete form; one with complete form has complete spirit. One with complete spirit—that is the Way of the sage. Entrusting life to walk alongside the people, not knowing where it leads, vast and perfectly complete!"

"Those who pursue profit, schemes, and cunning must forget the hearts of others.

**Commentary:** This is the Way of the sage-king, not that of ordinary people.

Zi Gong, hearing this discourse on borrowed cultivation, was convinced, yet he did not understand how the purely unblemished align with the world.

**Subcommentary:** Now, if the Venerable One had questioned me, it would not be thus. One who holds to the Dao suffers no lack in virtue; one with complete virtue suffers no harm in form; one with complete form attains undivided spirit. One with complete spirit entrusts progress to human inquiry, entrusts life to the world, and though walking alongside all things, knows not where it leads—dim and profound, beyond measure. Thus, their conduct is pure and harmonious, their virtue and power perfectly complete, and their hearts cannot be swayed by profit, schemes, or cunning. This is the Way of the sage, not the borrowed cultivation of mere practice.

Zi Gong, failing to comprehend, rashly applied what he had heard. As for such a person—their will does not pursue what it does not aspire to; their heart does not act where it does not incline. Though the world praises them and they attain what they deem right, they remain unmoved; though the world condemns them and they lose what they deem right, they remain untroubled. The world’s praise or blame neither benefits nor harms them—this is one of complete virtue.

I am but one tossed by the winds and waves.

**Commentary:** These are the followers of Song Rongzi, yet they do not attain complete virtue. Zi Gong’s confusion in this man is like Liezi’s intoxication with Ji Xian.

**Subcommentary:** Their demeanor is carefree and unconcerned, their manner free from intent. The Venerable One’s aspirations are pure and simple, unburdened by schemes, his heart content with few desires, unconcerned with action. Though the whole world praises him and extols his virtue, knowing it brings no benefit, he does not so much as glance; though the whole world condemns him and his reputation is ruined, perceiving it brings no harm, he does not accept it. Unmoved by praise or blame, he may be called one of complete virtue. Yet the nature of water, though clear, stirs into waves when wind arises; my heart, unsettled, is like those waves—hence, I am called one tossed by the winds and waves.

As Guo’s commentary states, these are the followers of Song Rongzi, yet they do not attain complete virtue. Zi Gong’s confusion in this man is like Liezi’s intoxication with Ji Xian.

Returning to Lu, he told Confucius. Confucius said: That man was one who borrowed the cultivation of Hun Dun’s guard.

**Commentary:** As he turned his back on the present and faced antiquity, shunning worldly affairs, it was clear he was not truly Hun Dun.

**Subcommentary:** Zi Gong, traveling from Lu to Chu, returned to Lu and reported the matter to Confucius. Now, *hun dun* means "undifferentiated." Since he turned his back on the present and faced antiquity, it is said he was not truly so.

He recognized one aspect but not the other.

**Commentary:** He merely recognized the simplicity of cultivating antiquity and embracing purity, yet he did not understand the ease of adapting to the times and responding to things.

**Subcommentary:** Recognizing one aspect means clinging to antiquity without change. Not recognizing the other means failing to adapt to the present and adjust to circumstances.

He cultivated his inner self but not his outer.

**Commentary:** The true Hun Dun does not cultivate at all—how could he treat his inner self as distinct and cultivate it alone?

**Subcommentary:** Embracing the Dao and guarding simplicity is cultivating the inner; unable to adapt to the times and respond to change is not cultivating the outer.

One who is clear-minded and enters simplicity, who practices non-action and returns to purity, who embodies nature and holds fast to spirit, and thus wanders amidst the world of men—would you be truly astonished?

**Commentary:** This is the true Hun Dun, who moves with the world yet does not lose himself, thus blending into the common without distinction—how could this make you astonished?

**Subcommentary:** One whose mind is clear and attains the essence of simplicity, who practices non-action and returns to the source of purity, who awakens to true nature and holds fast to its essence, and thus wanders amidst the clamor of the world—should this be like rivers and seas among the people, forests and marshes among the myriad things, where birds and beasts are not startled, how could men be astonished? Yet to say "would you be truly astonished" is to clarify that one should not be astonished.

Moreover, as for the arts of Hun Dun, how could you and I be sufficient to understand them?

**Commentary:** To him, it is his way; to us, it is ours. Hun Dun is profoundly the same—who can understand it? What can be understood is merely the understanding of its descriptions.

**Subcommentary:** Hun Dun is without intent, surpassing all wisdom and thought. Even if sages and worthies were to appear in the world, how could they suffice to understand it? Its obscurity and profundity transcend the bounds of sentiment and intention.

Zhun Mang, traveling east to the Great Abyss, encountered Yuan Feng on the shores of the Eastern Sea.

**Subcommentary:** *Zhun* means "pure"; *mang* means "vast." *Yuan* is a small wind, or else a great whirlwind. *Bin* means "shore"; the *Great Abyss* is the sea. Zhun Mang and Yuan Feng are both allegorical figures. Zhuangzi employed these two to illustrate the great Dao, thus setting them as guest and host, meeting on the sea’s edge.

Yuan Feng said: Where are you going?

**Subcommentary:** *Xi* means "what"; *zhi* means "to go." He inquired of Zhun Mang where he was traveling.

He said: To the Great Abyss.

**Subcommentary:** He wished to go to the Eastern Sea.

Yuan Feng said: What for?

**Subcommentary:** He asked what he sought there.

He said: The Great Abyss, as a thing, receives all without filling, draws from all without exhausting—I shall wander there.

**Subcommentary:** The great sea is vast and profound, its depths unfathomable. A hundred rivers flow into it without overflowing; the Tail Conduit drains it without drying. This is an analogy for the supreme principle, whose meaning is likewise. Thus, though he spoke of traveling to the azure depths, in truth, he was wandering in the great Dao.

Yuan Feng said: Do you have no regard for the horizontal-eyed people? I wish to hear of sagely governance."

Yuan Feng, having perceived this intent, thereupon posed this question: "Does the Master truly have no concern for the black-headed people? I wish to hear of the methods of sagely transformation."

Zhun Mang said: "Sagely governance? Offices are established without losing their proper place; the capable are promoted without misjudging their talents.

**Subcommentary:** Commands are issued and offices set up, each attaining its fitting role; skills are selected and recommendations made without failing to match abilities. Knowing this, the world attains great peace, the constant norms are properly ordered, and the safeguard of sagely governance lies herein.

Act after fully perceiving the circumstances and proceed with what is to be done.

**Commentary:** All is followed and entrusted to them.

**Subcommentary:** Affairs are often discordant, undertakings manifold; thus, steps are taken at different times, and the pure and the decadent belong to different ages. Therefore, in governance, nothing precedes entrusting things to their own nature. Only after clearly seeing the circumstances and examining what is to be done, then following things as they are, can nothing be amiss.

Words and deeds arise of themselves, and the world is transformed.

**Commentary:** If things are made to follow one, they are not transformed.

**Subcommentary:** All actions taken and teachings spoken are entrusted to things themselves, not making things follow oneself. Thus, all living beings under heaven naturally follow transformation. With a wave of the hand or a glance, the people of the four directions all arrive together—this is called sagely governance.

**Commentary:** This means that with a gesture or a look, the people each attain their nature, for they are left to act of themselves.

**Subcommentary:** To move the hand or turn the gaze is to command with a gesture; thus, the four directions revere and submit, and the ten thousand states come to court. The efficacy of sagely governance is thus.

Some versions have "manifest" in place of "wave," meaning that with manifest commands, the four directions all submit. Here, there are three kinds of people: the sagely, the virtuous, and the spirit-like. The above concerns sagely governance; below, the virtuous and spirit-like are listed in order.

I wish to hear of the virtuous person.

**Subcommentary:** The preceding sagely governance was explained with broad strokes; the meaning of the virtuous person is what I deeply wish to hear.

He said: The virtuous person dwells without thought, moves without deliberation.

**Commentary:** Simply following nature.

**Subcommentary:** Profoundly attuned to the realm of the Dao, attaining what is without attainment—thus is called the virtuous person. The virtuous person concentrates the spirit and sits in solemn stillness, utterly without thought; even when responding to things and enacting transformation, there is never any scheming or planning. They harbor no right or wrong, beauty or ugliness.

**Commentary:** Having no right or wrong in the breast, they entrust all to the world.

**Subcommentary:** Embracing the Dao and holding to virtue, self and other are both forgotten—how could they harbor right and wrong, contain good and evil? Within the four seas, all rejoice in what is beneficial to all, all are at ease with what provides for all.

**Commentary:** Without a heart of self-interest.

**Subcommentary:** The virtuous person’s beneficence is vast and far-reaching, universally covering all beings. Thus, goods and benefits are shared equally by the four seas, and provision is given to the ten thousand people without distinction. This is the universal joy of heaven and earth, the peace of all under heaven. They are enlightened as if an infant who has lost its mother, disoriented as if a traveler who has lost the way.

**Subcommentary:** An infant who has lost its mother is bright with longing yet has nowhere to rely; a traveler who has lost the way is bewildered and has no place to turn. These two analogies illustrate the virtuous person.

Wealth and resources are abundant, yet they do not know whence they come; food and drink are sufficient, yet they do not know from where they arise—this is called the bearing of the virtuous person.

**Commentary:** Virtue is the expression of the spirit-like person, hence it is called bearing.

**Subcommentary:** Desires are few and limited to what is proper, thus wealth and resources are abundant; flavors are not sought, thus food and drink are sufficient; there is no seeking in life and destiny, thus they do not know from where things come. Summarizing the preceding meaning, this is called the bearing of the virtuous person.

I wish to hear of the spirit-like person.

**Commentary:** I wish to hear how they express it.

**Subcommentary:** Virtue is the path of the spirit-like person; I wish to hear how they express it.

He said: The supreme spirit-like person rides the light, and with form, perishes and vanishes.

**Commentary:** Riding the light means having no light.

**Subcommentary:** Rides means employs; light means wisdom. The highest spirit-like person employs wisdom to illuminate things. Though their light is like the sun and moon, it illuminates and then vanishes, withdrawing the body and dismissing cleverness, both heart and form are abandoned—thus, with form, they perish and vanish. This is called illuminating the vast.

**Commentary:** Without self and entrusting things to their own nature, empty and without anything harbored—this is not obstruction.

**Subcommentary:** Wisdom encompasses the ten thousand things, brightness surpasses the three luminaries; nothing is too obscure to be illuminated—is this not vast? Life is fully realized and emotions are exhausted; heaven and earth rejoice, and the ten thousand affairs vanish.

**Commentary:** When emotions are exhausted and life is fully realized, heaven and earth rejoice. When affairs do not hinder joy, this is having no affairs.

**Subcommentary:** Exhausting the utmost of nature and destiny, fully realizing the emotions of life and transformation—thus, dwelling between heaven and earth, they are never not carefree and joyful. Having penetrated the illusory emptiness of self and other, the ten thousand affairs vanish. The ten thousand things return to their emotions—this is called the mingling of darkness.

**Commentary:** Emotions return and darkness mingles without progression.

**Subcommentary:** Forgetting illumination yet illuminating, illumination rivals the three luminaries in brilliance; forgetting life yet living, life shares the joy of the two poles. Thus, they can observe the return of the ten thousand things to their origin, witness the four kinds of life returning to their destiny—therefore, chaos is undivided and darkness is one with the Dao.

Menwu Gui and Chizhang Manji observed the troops of King Wu.

**Subcommentary:** Men and Chizhang are surnames; Wugui and Manji are given names. Two thousand five hundred men make a *shi* (troop); *shi* means multitude. When King Wu attacked Zhou, his army crossed Meng Ford—at that time, the two men observed together.

Chizhang Manji said: "He does not compare to the Yu clan. Thus, he has encountered this calamity."

**Subcommentary:** Calamity means encounter. Yu Shun governed the age with yielding and deference; King Wu saved the world with shield and spear. Between yielding and shield, the difference is vast. Judging by this, they spoke of mutual incomparability.

The weapon of war is an inauspicious instrument, hence the disaster of slaughter and killing.

Menwu Gui said: "When the world is evenly governed, was it the Yu clan who governed it? Or was it governed only after chaos arose?"

**Commentary:** Both sages governed because of chaos—thus, yielding deference and the use of troops are merely matters of differing times, with no question of superiority between them.

**Subcommentary:** *Jun* means "even." If the world were at great peace and all things were in order, why would there be need for Yu Shun to establish laws and govern? It was only because Yao’s years were drawing to a close and his virtue was waning day by day that he yielded to Chonghua, entrusting him with the task of ordering the realm.

Chizhang Manji said: "That the world be evenly governed is the wish—why then calculate with the Yu clan in mind?"

**Commentary:** When governance is even, each wish is fulfilled—why then deliberate on the virtue of the Yu clan and push them forward as rulers? Xu Wugui’s words are correct.

**Subcommentary:** When the realm is clear and harmonious, and each aspiration is fulfilled, why deliberate on the virtue of the Yu clan and push them forward as rulers? This is to comprehend Wugui’s words and acknowledge their reason. The Yu clan were medicine for sores.

**Commentary:** The world was all at rest from wounds and chaos, hence they sought the medicine of the Yu clan.

**Subcommentary:** *Yang* means "head sore." When the body suffers wounds, one seeks a physician to heal them—just as when the world encounters turmoil, a sage is needed to govern it. Thus, without illness there is no physician, and without chaos there is no sage. To place a wig on a bald head, to seek a physician when ill.

**Subcommentary:** When the hair is thick as clouds, there is no need to apply a wig; when one is fortunate enough to be free of illness, why borrow a physician? Thus, when the world is clear and at peace, there is no need for a great sage. These two lines summarize the two preceding matters.

A filial son holds medicine to tend to his compassionate father, his countenance haggard—yet the sage feels shame at this.

**Commentary:** Those who govern the world do not do so for glory.

**Subcommentary:** *Cao* means "to hold"; *xiu* means "to tend." *Qiaoran* describes a withered appearance. Just as a filial son tending to his compassionate father does not boast of his merit, so too does a sage rescuing the world from disaster not take pride in glory. Such deeds are done out of necessity, hence the shame.

In an age of utmost virtue, worthies are not esteemed.

**Commentary:** The worthy occupy their proper place—this is not esteeming them.

**Subcommentary:** The unworthy and the worthy each occupy their proper place—this is not esteeming them to distinguish the worthy.

Abilities are not employed.

**Commentary:** The able act of themselves—this is not employing them.

**Subcommentary:** The clumsy and the skilled each follow their nature without boasting or striving—this is not esteeming or employing them.

The ruler is like the tip of a branch.

**Commentary:** He stands above things yet does not elevate himself.

**Subcommentary:** The ruler, dwelling above the people, is tranquil and empty, forgetting the self—like the tip of a high tree’s branch, without thought of glory or nobility.

The people are like wild deer.

**Commentary:** They are free and self-content.

**Subcommentary:** With the ruler practicing non-action, the people below are also pure and simple—like wild deer, free from the rites of kingship.

Upright yet unaware of it as righteousness, loving one another yet unaware of it as benevolence.

**Subcommentary:** Their hearts are straight and do not incline toward evil—how would they know of the righteousness that judges right and wrong? Following Heaven’s principle, they are mutually affectionate—how would they know of the benevolence of partial love?

Sincere yet unaware of it as loyalty, fitting yet unaware of it as trust.

**Commentary:** They follow their nature spontaneously, not through knowledge.

**Subcommentary:** Following their nature, they are sincere—unaware that this sincerity is loyalty. Acting in accord with principle, they are fitting—unaware that this fittingness is trust.

Moving like insects and employing one another, yet not taking it as a favor.

**Commentary:** They use their spontaneous movement, hence they move without gratitude.

**Subcommentary:** *Ci* means "to receive a favor." Creatures that move like insects—these are the refined and spirited kinds—employ one another, which is naturally fitting. Like the limbs and trunk, or the ears and eyes, with no intention of creation, how could there be a sense of receiving a favor? Governing things through non-action is likewise so.

Thus, conduct has no trace.

**Commentary:** The ruler enables their spontaneous conduct, hence there is no advancement.

**Subcommentary:** With the ruler and people pure and simple, above and below in harmony, they move following their nature—hence there is no nearness to record.

Affairs leave no transmission.

**Commentary:** Each remains within their proper place, hence there is no teaching transmitted to others.

**Subcommentary:** Like the head and feet, each has its office—remaining within their proper place, they do not transmit or learn from one another. With no nearness to record, affairs also vanish.

A filial son does not flatter his parents; a loyal minister does not fawn upon his ruler—this is the height of being a minister and son.

**Subcommentary:** To serve one’s parents well is filial piety. *Yu* means "false"; *chan* means "to deceive." To seek others not through uprightness is called *chan*. As a minister and son, serving father and ruler without deceit or flattery, exhausting loyalty and filial piety—this is the height of the minister’s and son’s virtue.

If he assents to whatever his parents say and approves whatever they do, the world calls him an unworthy son. If he assents to whatever his ruler says and approves whatever he does, the world calls him an unworthy minister. Yet how do we know this must necessarily be so?

**Commentary:** This is simply going against custom to follow one’s ruler and parents—hence custom calls them unworthy. Yet we do not know where the utmost correctness truly lies.

**Subcommentary:** *Buxiao* means "unlike." Whatever the ruler or father says or does, he follows without discerning good or bad, without the slightest intention of remonstrance—hence in the eyes of the world, he is truly unworthy. Yet we do not know where the true principle lies.

If one assents to what the world calls assent and approves what it calls good, one is not called a flattering or fawning person. Then is custom truly more strict toward parents and more reverent toward rulers?

**Commentary:** It is said that custom does not revere rulers and parents to the point of following custom—yet custom does not call this fawning. This makes clear that reverence is insufficient to subdue things; what subdues things lies rather in following custom.

Thus the sage never stands apart from the world, but always waxes and wanes with the times. When in an age of emperors, he is an emperor; when in an age of kings, he is a king—how could he turn his back on custom to impose his own way?

**Subcommentary:** *Yan* means "to teach." This clarifies that defiance and compliance are not fixed. When the world approves of goodness, remonstrance is right. Yet to defy custom and comply with one’s parents is called flattery, while to defy one’s parents and comply with custom—is this not fawning obsequiousness? Moreover, with both opposition and compliance, right and wrong appear, yet once opposition and compliance are emptied, we do not know where true principle lies. To defy one’s parents and comply with custom—can this be called reverence for rulers and parents? When one calls oneself a guide to others, they bristle with anger; when one calls oneself a flatterer of others, they frown in displeasure.

**Commentary:** The world ultimately takes majority agreement as correctness, so when called a flatterer, one shows anger and refuses to accept it. Yet all one’s life one guides others, all one’s life one flatters others—without inquiring into principle, merely seeking mutual approval.

**Subcommentary:** *Bo* and *fu* both describe an agitated appearance. *Dao* means "to lead," referring to flattery used to ingratiate oneself with rulers and parents. The people of the world, when called flatterers, show anger and reject the label, yet all their lives they engage in flattery. The whole world is like this. To assemble metaphors and adorn words is to gather a crowd, yet this beginning and end, root and branch, do not incur blame.

**Commentary:** To assemble metaphors and adorn words should incur the charge of flattery, yet the world again uses this to win people and gather crowds—this too is following custom, yet they are never seen as guilty.

**Subcommentary:** One who can assemble metaphors and embellish empty words draws people to compete for his favor, thus gathering a crowd. Able to preserve consistency from beginning to end, from root to branch, the crowd follows him, so no mutual blame arises. *Pi* originally had a variant meaning "to assemble jade tablets," referring to matching *gui* and *bi* jades. To drape robes and skirts, display colors, alter one’s appearance to ingratiate oneself with the age—yet not to call this flattery; to join the crowd, to blend right and wrong, yet not to call oneself one of the multitude—this is the height of folly.

**Commentary:** The world is utterly foolish, so one cannot but follow it.

**Subcommentary:** The Yellow Emperor draped robes and skirts to bring order to the world. Upper garments and lower skirts symbolize Heaven and Earth; red and purple hues are woven into patterns. Using such adornments, altering one’s appearance to ingratiate oneself with the age, the shallow and false do not call this flattery, but instead fawn upon their rulers. To join the crowd of vulgar people, to exchange judgments, to blend right and wrong, yet to consider oneself distinct from the multitude—this is the height of foolishness. One who knows his own folly is not utterly foolish; one who knows his own confusion is not utterly confused. The utterly confused never awaken in their lifetime; the utterly foolish never gain wisdom in their lifetime.

**Commentary:** That sages share the Dao yet emperors and kings take different paths is truly because the world’s confusion cannot be dispelled—so one follows and accords with it.

**Subcommentary:** *Jie* means "awakening"; *ling* means "wisdom." One who knows his own folly and confusion is a sage. Following and according with it, his folly is not confusion. The utterly foolish and confused are the vulgar, whose hearts are narrow and base, who meet circumstances and generate delusion, thus passing their whole lives without awakening. If three walk together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached, for the confused are few; if two are confused, effort is wasted and the destination is not reached, for the confused prevail. Yet now the whole world is confused. Though I have aspirations, they cannot be realized. Is this not lamentable?

**Commentary:** The whole world is confused, so though I seek the perfect Dao, it cannot be attained. Thus Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu merely followed the times.

**Subcommentary:** *Shi* means "to go"; *zhi* means "to reach"; *huo* means "delusion"; *qi* means "to seek." If three walk together and one loses the way, the destination may still be reached, for few are deluded and many are clear; if two are deluded, the spirit labors in vain and the destination is not reached, for delusion prevails over clarity. Now the whole world is deluded. Though Zhuangzi seeks the perfect Dao, there is no way to attain it—how sorrowful! Great music does not enter the ears of the village,

**Commentary:** It is not what the alleyways esteem.

**Subcommentary:** The *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* songs provoke uproarious laughter.

**Commentary:** When vulgar people hear sentimental tunes, they laugh in unison.

**Subcommentary:** Great music refers to the *Xian Chi* and *Da Shao* melodies, not what the back alleys and lanes hear. The *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* are likely ancient popular tunes, coarse and vulgar, so they provoke laughter and animated expressions, with everyone laughing in unison. Formerly, Marquis Wen of Wei listened to ancient music and fell asleep in delight; when he heard the new sounds of Zheng and Wei, he rejoiced—this is the same phenomenon. Thus lofty words do not lodge in the hearts of the multitude,

**Commentary:** They do not take them to heart.

The discourse of utmost subtlety transcends the vulgar realm—this is what is called "lofty words." Such words are fitting only for the treasuries of sages and worthies; how could they lodge within the minds of the multitude? Just as grand music does not enter the ears of alleyways, so too do lofty words find no resting place in the hearts of the common. The supreme words remain unspoken, for the blindness of custom prevails.

**Commentary:** This is why the world has never heeded the sage and always follows its own inclinations.

**Subcommentary:** *To emerge* means to become manifest. The words of the supreme Way are bland and flavorless, never reaching the ears of back alleys—how much less could they lodge in the hearts of the multitude? Yet the words of the vulgar, adorned with embellished and deceptive phrases, are like the *Zhe Yang* tunes, pleasing to many listeners. Since common sayings dominate the thoroughfares, the supreme words remain hidden and obscured. Thus the *Qi Wu Lun* states, "Words are concealed in luxuriant ornament." With both delusions at play, one cannot reach the intended destination.

**Commentary:** Each has its own grounds for belief, and so they know not where to go.

**Subcommentary:** *Heels* refer to the feet. Those who lose their way take north for south; once both delusions arise, their steps falter, and they cannot advance. Even if one person sought to proceed alone, how could they attain their former clarity? This further explains the previous confusion. Now, with the whole world deluded, though I may have aspirations, how could they be realized?

**Subcommentary:** If two people falter in their steps, their destination is already difficult to reach—how much more so when the whole world is lost? Thus, though one may harbor a seeking heart, it is surely unattainable. This explains the earlier lament, "Is this not sorrowful?" The depth of deception warrants such emphasis. To know it is unattainable yet still force it is yet another delusion; therefore, it is better to release it and not press further.

**Commentary:** Align with it and become one with it.

**Subcommentary:** *Release* means to let go. Since the delusion runs deep and is difficult to dispel in haste, to insist on correction is yet another folly. Better to let go and not press, so that self and others may find peace. If not pressed, who then shares in the worry?

**Commentary:** Allow them to find their own timely harmony, without forcing understanding, and all will live without worry in this world.

**Subcommentary:** *Share* means to join. If one lets things resolve their own confusion and abandons the urge to press, then both self and others wander freely, and worry vanishes—who then remains to share it?

A leper gives birth in the dead of night, hastily seizes a torch to examine the child, and anxiously fears it will resemble himself.

**Commentary:** *Leper* refers to an evil person. It means that no one in the world wishes to be wicked; some are compelled by harsh servitude, others lose their nature through delusion. Yet the deluded may reflect and return, and the wicked may think to reform. Thus, I practice non-action, and the world transforms itself.

**Subcommentary:** *Leper* refers to one afflicted with ugliness and disease. *Hastily* means quickly; *anxiously* describes a state of urgency. It speaks of an ugly person who gives birth at midnight, swiftly takes up a torch to inspect the child, and in a flurry of emotion fears it will resemble them. Even one so grotesquely ugly still hopes for change, desiring to abandon ugliness for beauty. How much more should the deluded, weary of their confusion, yearn for awakening? Release it and do not press, and naturally, there will be no worry or weariness.

A hundred-year-old tree is felled and carved into a sacrificial vessel, adorned with blue and yellow patterns. Yet its offcuts lie discarded in the ditch. Compared to the sacrificial vessel, the offcuts in the ditch differ in beauty and ugliness, yet in the loss of their original nature, they are one.

**Subcommentary:** *Sacrificial vessel* refers to a vessel shaped like an ox, used in rituals, called a *xi zun*. *Differ* means distinction. Once carved into the shape of an ox and further embellished with blue and yellow patterns, one piece is discarded in the ditch, unused. Comparing these two fragments, beauty and ugliness diverge, yet in the loss of their original nature, they are the same. This sets up the analogy.

Jie and Zeng, Shi and their like differ in conduct and righteousness, yet in the loss of their nature, they are equal.

**Subcommentary:** This draws the parallel. Jie’s tyranny and cruelty, Zeng and Shi’s practice of benevolence and righteousness—though their good and evil diverge, in the loss of their true nature, they are the same.

Moreover, there are five ways in which the original nature is lost:

**Subcommentary:** The ways in which delusion leads to the loss of nature are manifold, but in essence, there are five.

First, the five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear.

**Subcommentary:** The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black. The common people indulge in their pursuit, and these colors confuse the eyes, preventing them from seeing the truth—hence, *unclear*.

Second, the five sounds confuse the ears, rendering them unperceptive.

**Subcommentary:** The five sounds are *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*. Indulgence in vulgar sounds prevents one from hearing the Way—hence, *unperceptive*.

Third, the five odors assail the nose, obstructing and wounding the inner passages.

**Subcommentary:** The five odors are rank, scorched, fragrant, rotten, and putrid. *Obstruct* means blockage, referring to a state of congestion. It speaks of the nose indulging in the five odors, leading to blockage and inner injury. External texts refer to this as *odors*. Thus, the *Yi Jing* says, "Its fragrance is like orchid"; the *Daoist Canon* speaks of the five fragrances, and the *Xi Sheng Jing* says, "Fragrance and flavor fill the body."

Fourth, the five flavors muddy the mouth, causing illness and loss of taste.

**Subcommentary:** The five flavors are sour, bitter, sweet, acrid, and salty. *Illness* means affliction; *loss* means deprivation. Indulgence in the five flavors pollutes the mouth’s root, leading to disease from excess salt and bitterness, and the tongue losing its sense of taste—hence, *illness and loss*.

Fifth, preferences and aversions agitate the heart, causing the nature to become flighty.

**Subcommentary:** *Preferences* means to pursue; *agitate* means to disturb. Following the heart’s desires, one pursues; opposing them, one rejects. This disturbs the heart, causing the natural nature to race without rest, becoming light, restless, and agitated—hence, *flighty*.

These five are all harms to life.

**Subcommentary:** This summarizes the five preceding matters, all of which are blades that sever life and axes that harm it—great calamities to living beings.

Yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di, striving apart from the forked path, deemed themselves to have attained the Way—this is not what I call attainment.

**Subcommentary:** *Striving apart* describes the exertion of force. Yang Zhu and Mo Di, each flaunting their own abilities, harmed their nature and life, taking this as attainment. But since it contravenes the principle of naturalness, it is not the attainment recognized by Master Zhuang.

Is attainment found in confinement? Then the turtledove and magpie in their cage may also be said to have attained it.

**Subcommentary:** Those bound by benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and law do not follow their true nature. Having falsified their nature, they encounter hardship. If this hardship is deemed attainment, how does it differ from the turtledove or magpie in its cage, mistaking captivity for contentment?

Moreover, pursuing and rejecting sounds and colors clogs the inner self, while caps of skin and heron plumes, sashes and long robes constrain the outer form.

**Subcommentary:** *Caps of skin* are made from animal hide. The *heron* is a bird resembling a duck, with green plumage, found in Yulin. Its iridescent feathers adorn caps, hence *heron-plumed caps*. Such caps were worn by those versed in celestial patterns. *Sashes* are inserted like jade tablets; *sashes* are also called *insertions*. *Fen* denotes substance, and *shen* refers to the great belt. *Long robes* are formal court attire. These vain and artificial men make pursuit and rejection their trade, so that the inner treasury is choked with the kindling of sensory dust, while their outer form is bound by robes and sashes. Turning their backs on the Dao of non-action, they violate their natural nature, taking this as attainment—how does it differ from the turtledove or magpie?

Within, the inner self is blocked and brimming like a wattle fence; without, layer upon layer of snares encircle them. Gazing about in their snares, they deem themselves to have attained it—then the convict with arms bound and fingers twisted, or the tiger and leopard trapped in their sacks and cages, may also be said to have attained it.

**Subcommentary:** *Blocked* means obstructed; *brimming* means full. *Wattle fence* is a hedge. *Snares* are cords. *Gazing about* describes their appearance. Since pursuit and rejection obstruct and fill the inner treasury, it is like a wattle fence; sashes and belts bind the outer form, likened to cords. Having fallen into such ruin, if they still deem themselves to have attained it, how does it differ from the convict with arms bound and fingers twisted by the cords? Or like the tiger and leopard ensnared in sacks and cages, suffering distress and hardship beyond measure—if they mistake this for attainment, how does it differ?

**#37** *The "Omissions and Errors" notes that Zhang Junfang’s edition includes the character *crime* after *mutual*.

**#38** Originally *huá* (華), emended to *è* (萼) following the *Siku* and Zhejiang Bureau editions; the subcommentary below matches this.

**#39** The *Siku* and Zhejiang Bureau editions write *fǒu* (缶) for *chuí* (垂).

**#40** Emended from *lìng* (令) to *huì* (会) following Zhao’s edition.

**#41** The eight characters *guī yì chā yě wǔ chā sǔn yóu* (珪亦插也捂插笋犹) are garbled in meaning; following Guo Qingfan’s citation, they are corrected to *chā yě. Zhì, yóu guī, wèi chā* (插也。质，犹珪，谓插), seven characters in total.

**Annotations and Subcommentary on the Southern Florescence Scripture of the True Classic**
**Volume Fifteen**
**Guo Xiang of Henan, Annotation**
**Subcommentary by Master Cheng Xuanying of Xihua, Tang Dynasty**
**Outer Chapters: "The Dao of Heaven" (Thirteen)**

The Dao of Heaven revolves without accumulation, thus all things are completed.
**[Subcommentary]** *Revolves* means moves, turns. *Accumulation* means stagnation, hoarding. The Dao of Heaven turns and revolves, nurturing all living beings, illuminating them with sun and moon, moistening them with rain and dew, stirring and shaping them without stagnation or hoarding. Thus the four seasons cycle, and the myriad things are born and completed.

The Dao of the Emperor revolves without accumulation, thus the world submits.
**[Subcommentary]** The king models himself on Heaven and Earth, governing all beings, dispersing without hoarding, bestowing transformation without limit. Thus the six directions unite in submission, and the eight regions offer allegiance.

The Dao of the Sage revolves without accumulation, thus all within the seas obeys.
**[Annotation]** These three all indulge the nature of things without entanglement or stagnation.
**[Subcommentary]** The Dao of the Sage is the Way of the mysterious sage and unadorned king. Responding to circumstances, he establishes teachings and institutes laws, providing a vessel for the wise and deliverance without end. His Dao aligns with Heaven, his virtue matches the Emperor’s. Though his actions vary, there are thus two Ways—of Emperor and Sage. Yet in employing wisdom to save the age, he likewise accumulates nothing. His compassion is vast and boundless, thus all within the seas obeys.

Those enlightened by Heaven and attuned to the Sage, whose virtue of Emperor and King pervades the six directions and opens the four gates—let them act of themselves, and all will be obscurely still.
**[Annotation]** Allowing them to act of themselves, though the six directions pervade and the four gates open, stillness remains unharmed.
**[Subcommentary]** The *six directions* refer to the four quarters, above and below. The *four gates* are spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Only by illuminating the effortless Dao of Heaven, penetrating the Sage’s mind free of care, pervading the six directions with life and transformation, and following the four seasons in action—only thus, ruling over the ten thousand chariots, can one be called the virtue of Emperor and King. Allowing things to move of themselves, concealing brilliance and obscuring advancement, one remains as if dimly attuned. Movement does not disturb stillness, thus all is still.

The stillness of the Sage is not because stillness is good, and thus he is still.
**[Annotation]** If stillness were deemed good, there would be times of movement.
**[Subcommentary]** The Sage’s emptiness and stillness are like a withered tree in form, like dead ashes in mind—he does not know stillness *as* stillness. If stillness were considered good and he acted with intent to be still, then there would indeed be times of movement.

Nothing suffices to disturb his mind, thus he is still.
**[Annotation]** This is self-possession.
**[Subcommentary]** His wondrous essence mirrors the Two Modes yet is non-being; all realms are empty. Thus he moves amid the ten thousand changes without disturbance, not through disciplined effort to attain stillness.

When water is still, it clearly reflects beard and brows, its level surface serving as a standard—even the great craftsman takes it as his model.
**[Subcommentary]** Water, when moving, flows in waves; when still, it becomes limpid. Suspended as a mirror, it illuminates without partiality, thus it clearly reflects beard and brows, pure and centered. Correcting all crookedness, it serves as a standard. Even the most skilled craftsman must rely on water to find levelness. Thus the *Lao Scripture* says, "The highest good is like water." This illustrates the preceding meaning.

If still water is so clear, how much more the spirit? The Sage’s mind is still—it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the looking-glass of the myriad things.
**[Annotation]** Possessing the instrument and allowing it to act of itself, what it illuminates is without obscurity.
**[Subcommentary]** The Sage’s virtue aligns with the Two Modes, his wisdom encompasses the myriad things—how can he be compared to the insentient water? If still water clearly reflects the temples, how much more the spirit of the Sage’s still mind? Thus it is fitting that he mirrors the subtleties of Heaven and Earth and reflects the mysterious traces of the myriad things. This concludes the analogy.

Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, solitude, non-action—these are the level of Heaven and Earth and the utmost of the Dao and virtue.
**[Annotation]** All that is not level or not utmost arises from action.
**[Subcommentary]** Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, solitude, non-action—these four are different names for the same reality. Their excellence is praised, thus they bear these four names. Heaven and Earth take them as level, the Dao and virtue employ them as utmost.

Thus Emperors, Kings, and Sages rest in them.
**[Annotation]** They never move.
**[Subcommentary]** Ceasing thought, they rest in stillness. Resting, they are empty; empty, they are full. Fullness is principle.
**[Annotation]** *Principle* means pattern.
**[Subcommentary]** Having ceased thought and rested, they naturally align with emptiness; aligning with emptiness, they unite with true reality. Uniting with the true Dao, they attain the principle of nature.

Empty, then still; still, then moving; moving, then attaining.
**[Annotation]** Not losing that by which one moves.
**[Subcommentary]** Principle is empty and still; stillness can move—thus one attains.

Still, then non-action; in non-action, those who bear responsibility fulfill their duties.
**[Annotation]** In non-action, the myriad talents and beings each bear their duties and naturally fulfill their responsibilities.

Thus it is said: "How majestic were Shun and Yu, who possessed the world yet did not engage with it"—this is what is meant.

**[Subcommentary]** To bear responsibility is the role of ministers, for each subordinate has their appointed duties. When the emperor and king employ wisdom yet remain tranquil in non-action, their ministers fulfill their offices, each attending to their concerns. Thus, the sovereign remains in non-action while ministers attend to affairs, so that the crown hangs low before the eyes, yet does not interfere. In non-action, one is serene and at ease; in such ease, no worry or trouble can take hold, and longevity is attained.

**[Annotation]** *Yu yu* describes a demeanor of leisurely self-possession.

**[Subcommentary]** *Yu yu* expresses a bearing of ease and joy. Those who act are entangled in circumstances, and worldly burdens thus ensnare the mind; those who rest in non-action and self-possession find no place for anxiety in their thoughts. Serene and joyful, they attain long life.

For emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the root of the myriad things.

**[Annotation]** Tracing their origin, all things arise from non-action.

**[Subcommentary]** These four qualities are the foundation of all things, so they are reiterated here to conclude with their excellence.

Illuminating this and facing south, one becomes a ruler like Yao; illuminating this and facing north, one becomes a minister like Shun.

**[Subcommentary]** In the beauty of yielding and deference, none surpass the era of Tang; in the flourishing of ruler and minister, none precede Yao and Shun. Thus, these two sovereigns exemplify the four virtues. Though their positions differ—one facing south, the other north—they attain the same perfection.

Embodying this in a superior position, one attains the virtue of emperors, kings, and the Son of Heaven; embodying this in a subordinate position, one follows the Way of the profound sage and unadorned king.

**[Annotation]** These are the heights of non-action.

**[Subcommentary]** Those who possess the Way yet lack its rank, drawing the world to them without holding office—this is what is meant by the unadorned king’s self-valuing. Applying this non-action to govern from above is the virtue of the Son of Heaven, Emperor Yao; applying this emptiness and tranquility to serve below is the Way of the profound sage and unadorned king. Those who possess the Way but lack its rank—such as the profound sage and unadorned king who value themselves—are exemplified by Laozi and Confucius.

Retreating to dwell in seclusion and wander freely by rivers and seas, scholars of the mountains and forests submit to them.

**[Subcommentary]** *Retreating* refers to withdrawing into obscurity and concealment. Applying this Way in retreat, one may wander and dine amidst mountains and waters, at ease and joyful. Thus, all reclusive scholars submit to them—such as those like Xu You and Chao Fu.

Applying this to advance and govern the world, one achieves great merit, renowned fame, and the unity of all under heaven.

**[Annotation]** This is the next level.

Thus, in retreat, they resemble those like Xu You and Chao Fu; in advancement, they resemble those like Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou.

How vast is the substance of non-action! What in the world cannot be accomplished through it? Therefore, if the sovereign does not undertake the duties of the chief minister, then Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou remain tranquil in their offices; if the chief minister does not execute the tasks of the hundred officials, then the hundred officials remain tranquil in their governance; if the hundred officials do not impose their affairs upon the myriad people, then the people remain tranquil and secure in their occupations; if the myriad people do not alter their respective abilities, then the distinctions of self and other in the world remain tranquil and self-possessed. Thus, from the Son of Heaven down to the common people, extending even to insects, who can achieve anything through action?

Therefore, the more one embodies non-action, the more exalted one becomes.

**[Subcommentary]** *Advancing* refers to emerging into prominence and assuming office. Those who embody the wondrous substance of non-action while descending to engage with the world can govern the people with benevolence and longevity, magnify perfect virtue in the sagely court, manifest unfathomable merit and fame, and display the achievements of the great ministers. Thus, all under heaven is unified, sharing the same standards and script; in utmost goodness and beauty, who surpasses those like Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou?

Still, they are sagely; moving, they are kingly.

**[Annotation]** When it is time to act, they act; when it is time to rest, they rest.

In non-action, they are exalted.

**[Annotation]** Naturally revered by all things.

**[Subcommentary]** In stillness, they attain the exaltation of the profound sage and unadorned king; in action, they hold the nobility of the nine-five sovereign. In non-action, they are exalted—emerging, they become the Son of Heaven; dwelling, they remain the unadorned lord. Thus, wherever the Way resides, who would not honor it?

In simplicity and plainness, none in the world can rival their beauty.

**[Annotation]** Only simplicity and plainness match the beauty of heaven.

**[Subcommentary]** For unadorned simplicity, non-action, and emptiness are truly the root of all things. Thus, in their exaltation, who can rival their beauty?

Those who comprehend the virtue of heaven and earth—this is called the great root and great origin, those who harmonize with heaven.

**[Annotation]** Heaven and earth take non-action as their virtue; thus, understanding their origin and root means no opposition to heaven and earth.

**[Subcommentary]** When the numinous mind is bright and still, the spirit’s illumination pure and unblemished, and one’s virtue aligns with the two powers, one can indeed serve as the master of all things, the root of the myriad existences, mysteriously uniting with the Dao of nature and harmonizing with heaven.

This is how one harmonizes and regulates all under heaven, and harmonizes with others.

**[Annotation]** Following heaven is how one responds to others; thus, when heavenly harmony is perfected, human harmony is complete.

**[Subcommentary]** *Harmonizing* means leveling; *regulating* means aligning. Without intention in response, like echo following sound, one levels all things and aligns with the feelings of the world, blending and advancing together. Thus, one harmonizes with others.

Those who harmonize with others are called human joy; those who harmonize with heaven are called heavenly joy.

**[Annotation]** When heavenly joy is attained, human joy is fulfilled.

**[Subcommentary]** Descending to blend with the world, one delights in the joys of the human realm; ascending to unite with nature, one rejoices in the joy of the heavenly Dao.

Zhuangzi said: "O my master! O my master! You blend the myriad things yet are not cruel."

**[Annotation]** Changing and intermingling, thus it is called a stew. This is sagely, not my master’s cruelty.

**[Subcommentary]** *Sagely* means refined; *cruel* means violent. Zhuangzi took the natural supreme Dao as his master, repeating this to extol its virtue.

The Dao I take as my master nurtures and sustains all living beings. Even if it orders the myriad things, it harbors no intent of violence or anger. Thus, when autumn’s frosts cause withering and decay, none resent it. This makes clear that though it severs and divides, it is not by judgment.

Its blessings extend through ten thousand generations yet it is not called benevolent.
**[Annotation]** Benevolence is but the name for partial love; without love, there is nothing to call transformation.
**[Subcommentary]** Benevolence is the advance of partial love. The great Dao opens and closes heaven and earth, creating and transforming all beings. Its boundless kindness is impartial, thus it is not called benevolent.

It endures since high antiquity yet is not called long-lived.
**[Annotation]** Longevity is but the name for distant duration; without duration, there is nothing to call long-lived.
**[Subcommentary]** How could it merely endure since high antiquity? It existed even before the Lord of Heaven. Since it neither perishes nor arises, how could it be called short-lived or long-lived? As Guo’s annotation says, longevity is but the name for distant duration.

It covers and bears heaven and earth, carves and shapes the myriad forms yet is not called skillful.
**[Annotation]** Skillfulness is but the name for what is exquisitely made; all things are so of themselves, thus there is nothing to call skillful.
**[Subcommentary]** Riding the two powers to cover and bear, taking the myriad things to carve and shape—yet the two powers take generation and transformation as their function, and the myriad things take spontaneity as their use. Since generation and transformation do not rely on anything else, and carving and shaping do not depend on others, each thing employs its abilities, and each person follows its nature. Thus, the names of craft and clumsiness vanish. As Guo’s annotation says, skillfulness is but the name for what is exquisitely made.

This is called heavenly joy.
**[Annotation]** Forgetting joy, joy is complete.
**[Subcommentary]** Wherever one finds contentment, heavenly joy is formed.

Thus it is said: Those who know heavenly joy, in life follow the movement of heaven, in death merge with the transformations of things.
**[Subcommentary]** Knowing that heavenly joy is beyond sorrow and joy, one understands life and death. Without life or death, in life one moves with heaven’s dispensation, in death one blends with the changes of the myriad things.

At rest, they share the virtue of yin; in motion, they ride the waves of yang.
**[Subcommentary]** Their wondrous root is empty and still, so they equal yin in its tranquility; responding and acting in the world, they merge with the flowing waves of great yang.

Thus, those who know heavenly joy harbor no resentment from heaven, no blame from others, no burdens from things, no reproach from spirits.
**[Subcommentary]** Their virtue harmonizes with heaven, so they incur no heavenly resentment; their conduct accords with the world, so they suffer no human blame; they are darkly one with things, so things do not burden them; they owe nothing to the seen or unseen, so how could spirits reproach them?

Thus it is said: In movement, they are like heaven; in stillness, they are like earth.
**[Annotation]** Though movement and stillness differ, their lack of intent is one.
**[Subcommentary]** Heaven and earth summarize the meaning of movement and stillness without intent.

With a single mind settled, they rule all under heaven. Their spirits bring no misfortune, their souls know no fatigue.
**[Annotation]** Always without intent, thus they rule all under heaven without weariness or illness.
**[Subcommentary]** When realm and wisdom merge, it is called "one." Things cannot disturb it, thus it is called "settled." Precisely because it is settled in the one mind, it can rule the myriad states. Since there is no reproach from spirits, what misfortune could arise? Moving yet ever still, thus the soul does not grow weary.

With a single mind settled, the myriad things submit.
**[Subcommentary]** A single mind congealed and still is like dead ashes, yet stillness governs activity, so the myriad things return and submit.

This means using emptiness and stillness to extend through heaven and earth, to penetrate the myriad things—this is called heavenly joy.
**[Annotation]** When my mind is ever still, the minds of the myriad things are open to it. Open, they submit; closed, they rebel.
**[Subcommentary]** Why does a single mind settled make the myriad things submit? It is simply that using the wisdom of emptiness and stillness, one traces the principles of the two powers, comprehends the feelings of the myriad things, and turns with their changes without ever failing to be fitting. Thus, it is called heavenly joy.

Heavenly joy is the heart-mind of the sage, by which they nurture all under heaven.
**[Annotation]** What does the heart-mind of the sage use to nurture all under heaven? Heavenly joy.
**[Subcommentary]** The reason the sage descends to walk the same path as the common and harmonizes with the supreme joy of heaven and earth is precisely to nurture and sustain all living beings.

The virtue of emperors and kings takes heaven and earth as its model, the Dao and its power as its master, and non-action as its constant.
**[Subcommentary]** The ruler models themselves on heaven and earth, thus they cover and bear without intent; they take the Dao and its power as their master, thus they generate without possessing; though they undergo a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, they always remain non-active. Such abundant virtue is what made Yao a true lord.

Through non-action, they employ all under heaven with ease.
**[Annotation]** Ease refers to leisure.
Through action, they are employed by all under heaven yet remain insufficient.
**[Annotation]** Insufficiency refers to the anxious desire to be used by things. Desiring to be used by things, they can be made subjects. Yet when they become subjects, they too have ease.
**[Subcommentary]** Insufficiency is an expression of eagerness. Ease refers to leisure. When the lord practices non-action, their wisdom shines broadly, governing the realm with leisure to spare. When ministers act, their concerns are narrow and inferior, each attending to their duties, serving the lord without rest, yet still fearing insufficiency. Thus, non-action and action follow different paths of labor and rest. This is why the ancients valued non-action.

When those above practice non-action, those below also practice non-action—this means those below share the same virtue as those above. When those below share the same virtue as those above, they do not serve as subjects.
When those below act, those above also act—this means those above share the same path as those below. When those above share the same path as those below, they do not serve as lords.
**[Annotation]** The craftsman does not act in carving wood but acts in using the axe; the lord does not act in attending to affairs but acts in employing ministers. Ministers can attend to affairs, and lords can employ ministers; axes can carve wood, and craftsmen can use axes. Each fulfills their abilities, and thus the principle of heaven is spontaneous, not a matter of action.

If the lord takes up the affairs of ministers, he is no longer a lord; if ministers wield the lord’s authority, they are no longer ministers. Thus, when each attends to their own duties, the principle of non-action reaches its perfection in both above and below.

**[Annotation]** Non-action is the virtue of the ruler; action is the way of the minister. If both above and below practice non-action, ministers usurp the ruler’s virtue; if both above and below act, the ruler encroaches upon the minister’s way. When the ruler encroaches upon the minister’s way, he is no longer a lord; when ministers usurp the ruler’s virtue, how can they be called ministers? Thereupon, above and below become confused, lord and minister transgress their bounds, and having deviated from the natural order, disaster inevitably follows. Thus, the teaching of non-action must not be left unexamined.

Non-action belongs to the ruler. The ancients prized non-action. Guo’s commentary on this passage is most eloquent and reasoned. The one above must practice non-action to employ all under heaven, while the one below must act to be employed by all under heaven—this is an unchanging Dao.

**[Annotation]** The teaching of non-action must not be left unexamined. For the one who employs all under heaven, there is indeed an act of employing. Yet, attaining this act, one moves in accordance with their nature, and thus it is called non-action. Now, those who are employed by all under heaven also attain this naturally. But those below attend to affairs, so even when Yao or Yu served as ministers, they were still called men of action. Thus, in relation to above and below, the lord is quiescent while the minister is active; in comparison to past and present, Yao and Shun practiced non-action while Tang and Wu had affairs to attend to. Yet each acted according to their nature, and the mysterious workings of heaven’s mechanism were spontaneously manifest—then in ancient and modern times, above and below, who truly acted?

**[Annotation]** One who occupies the position above as lord must invariably practice non-action and entrust matters to others, employing the talents of all under heaven. One who dwells below as minister must attend to affairs and act, fulfilling the duties of their office—thus all under heaven is transformed. This is the unchanging Dao of the hundred kings. Therefore, the ancient kings who ruled all under heaven, though their wisdom embraced heaven and earth, did not scheme for themselves.

**[Annotation]** This refers to the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the pure and ancient lords. Their wisdom was luminous and penetrating, encompassing the two poles, yet they reigned with folded arms and practiced non-action, delegating matters to their ministers. The wise devised strategies, so they did not scheme for themselves.

Though their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not speak for themselves.

**[Annotation]** Their vast eloquence flowed like a river, adorning the myriad things, yet they entrusted governance to their ministers and never spoke on their own behalf.

Though their abilities exhausted all within the seas, they did not act for themselves.

**[Annotation]** Those above rest in their inability to practice non-action by taking up the duties of their ministers. If the lord prevents Gaosi from exercising his keen judgment or Hou Ji from carrying out his planting, then talents lose their proper roles and the lord becomes entangled in toil. Thus, with the crown’s tassels veiling his eyes, he entrusts all to the world, and all under heaven act according to their own nature—this is non-action that accomplishes everything, so both above and below practice non-action. Yet the non-action of the one above employs those below, while the non-action of those below is self-employment.

**[Annotation]** Though their talents and abilities surpassed all within the seas, they entrusted them to worthy assistants and did not interfere—what was there to do but remain in profound silence? Thus, the *Laozi* says, "This is called employing the strength of others." Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things are transformed; earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured.

**[Annotation]** That is, they are so of themselves.

**[Annotation]** Heaven has no intention to produce, yet the myriad things are transformed and born; earth has no mind to grow, yet the myriad things mature and flourish. Thus, Guo’s commentary says, "This is called being so of itself."

The lord and king practice non-action, yet the achievements of all under heaven are accomplished.

**[Annotation]** Achievements are completed by others.

**[Annotation]** The king, in harmony with the two poles’ nurturing, follows the four seasons in bestowing governance, and entrusts the myriad things to act on their own—thus the achievements of all under heaven are accomplished. Therefore, it is said: none is more divine than heaven, none richer than earth, none greater than the lord and king.

**[Annotation]** The sun and moon alternate in brightness and obscurity, clouds and thunder, wind and rain, all providing shelter and nourishment beyond measure—thus none is more divine than heaven. It encompasses rivers and plains, contains mountains and streams, and bears all without end—thus none is richer than earth. Occupying the position of nine and five, wielding the might of ten thousand chariots, with the sun and moon shining upon them, one person governs all—none surpasses the lord and king in greatness of power and virtue. Thus, the *Laozi* says, "Within the realm, four are great, and the king is one of them." Therefore, it is said: the virtue of the lord and king matches heaven and earth.

**[Annotation]** It is the same as the non-action of heaven and earth.

**[Annotation]** *Pei* means to match. The virtue of the sage matches the non-action of heaven and earth. This is the Dao of riding heaven and earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the talents of the people.

**[Annotation]** Comprehending the lordless spontaneity of heaven’s sheltering and earth’s bearing, one thus rides and governs the two poles. Following the coming and going of transformations, one can drive the myriad things. Entrusting the talents of the black-haired people, this is the Dao of employing the people’s abilities. The root lies above, the branches lie below.

**[Annotation]** The root is the Dao and virtue; the branches are benevolence and righteousness. Dao and virtue are simple and unadorned, the fundamental governance of high antiquity. Benevolence and righteousness are refined and shallow, the lesser arts of later ages. Thus, it is said: the root lies above, the branches lie below. The essential lies with the lord, the details lie with the ministers.

**[Annotation]** *Yao* means simplicity and essentials; *xiang* means complexity and abundance. The lord’s way is leisurely and simple, while the minister’s way is laborious and cumbersome. Being cumbersome, they act and serve those above; being simple, they practice non-action and govern those below. The deployment of the three armies and the five weapons is the lesser aspect of virtue.

**[Annotation]** The five weapons are: bow, shield, spear, dagger-axe, and sword. *Yun* means movement. In an age of sagely brightness, civil arts are cultivated and military arts are laid aside. When virtue declines, civil arts are laid aside and military arts are cultivated. When civil arts are laid aside and military arts are cultivated, the five weapons stir in chaos; when military arts are laid aside and civil arts are cultivated, the four peoples live in peace and engage in their occupations. The root and branches of virtue may be known from this.

Rewards and punishments, advantages and harms—the five penal laws—are the lesser aspect of instruction.

**[Annotation]** Rewards bring chariots, caps, glory, and splendor, hence advantage. Punishments bring execution, mutilation, and humiliation, hence harm. *Bi* means law. The five punishments are: one, nose amputation; two, branding; three, foot amputation; four, castration; five, capital punishment. When the Way is lost and virtue declines, falsity and deceit grow daily, so penal laws are established to govern the common people. Yet this injures the root of principle and becomes merely the lesser aspect of instruction.

Rites, laws, measures, calculations, forms, names, comparisons, and assessments are the lesser aspect of governance.

**[Annotation]** Rites and laws refer to the laws of the five rites. *Shu* means computation; *du* means measurement; *xing* means deportment; *ming* means names and taboos; *bi* means comparison; *xiang* means determination. Employing such methods to nurture the people, governance departs from ancient purity, hence it is the lesser aspect of governance.

The sounds of bells and drums, the adornments of feathers and fur, are the lesser aspect of music.

**[Annotation]** Music means harmony. *Yu* refers to bird feathers; *ni* refers to animal fur—meaning that the feathers of birds and the fur of beasts are used to adorn instruments. The reason sage-kings composed music was to harmonize yin and yang below and align with customs above. The ancients, hearing music, could discern a state’s rise or fall, whether an age was well-ordered or chaotic, for its tones differed. Thus, great music harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, and is not merely feathers, fur, bells, or drums. From the Three Dynasties onward, decadence has flourished: the lewd sounds of Zheng and Wei are prized, while the refined rhythms of *Yunshao* are abandoned. Thus, feathers and fur become mere ornamentation, and elaborate deportment prevails. This is not the root of *Xianchi* but merely the lesser aspect of *Pu* music.

Mourning garments of varying degrees—weeping, sackcloth, and hempen bands—are the lesser aspect of grief.

A *diē* is the substantive aspect. *Cuī* means "to crush." The upper garment is called *cuī*, and the lower garment is called *shang*. Both the headband and waistband bear *diē*. "Gradations of mourning" refers to the five degrees of mourning attire—*zhāncuī*, *zīcuī*, *dàgōng*, *xiǎogōng*, and *sīmá*—where weeping, garments, and headdresses each have their respective distinctions. This is the teaching of external forms, not the outpouring of inner emotion, and thus the lesser aspect of grief.

These five lesser aspects require the movement of spirit and the activation of the heart’s workings before they may follow. The *annotation* states: The flourishing of spirit and heart is the root of the five lesser aspects. When one moves in accordance with natural spontaneity, the lesser aspects of the five affairs arise of themselves without need for contrivance.

The *exegesis* explains: *Wèi* means "capacity"; what the heart is capable of is called "heart’s flourishing." The flourishing of spirit and heart is the root of the five lesser aspects. These five lesser aspects must be guided by the spirit, the heart’s wisdom, and the movement of one’s inherent nature before they may accord with the five affairs—this is not the way of artificial posturing. The study of lesser aspects was practiced by the ancients, but it is not what should come first.

The *annotation* states: What should come first is the root.

The *exegesis* explains: The "ancients" here refer to the people of the middle antiquity. "First" means "root." The study of the five lesser aspects existed in middle antiquity, but it was tainted by artifice and ultimately not the fundamental principle. The ruler precedes and the minister follows; the father precedes and the child follows; the elder brother precedes and the younger brother follows; the elder precedes and the younger follows; the man precedes and the woman follows; the husband precedes and the wife follows.

The *exegesis* states: The precedence of the honored and the subordination of the humble are the workings of Heaven and Earth. The order of honor and humility, of precedence and subsequence, is the movement of Heaven and Earth, and thus the sages took it as their model.

The *annotation* states: Though this order of precedence and subsequence pertains to human affairs, it arises from the utmost principle and is not something the sages fabricated.

The *exegesis* explains: The "workings of Heaven and Earth" refer to spring and summer preceding, autumn and winter following—the progression of the four seasons. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they still have distinctions of honor and humility, of precedence and subsequence. How much more so in human relations, where there can be no absence of order? Thus, the sages modeled themselves on the transformations of the Two Modes and observed the spontaneity of the four sequences, thereby establishing the great righteousness of ruler and minister and rectifying the essential Way of father and child.

Heaven is honored, Earth is humble—this is the position of the numinous. Spring and summer precede, autumn and winter follow—this is the sequence of the four seasons.

The *exegesis* states: Heaven’s honor and Earth’s humility are unalterable positions. Spring precedes and winter follows—this order is immutable. These two principles suffice to clarify the myriad things.

The myriad things transform and take shape, each with its distinct form.

The *exegesis* explains: The transformations of the myriad things never cease for a moment. They rise and fall, now born, now dead, in a thousand lineages and ten thousand kinds, their colors and categories differing, yet their early signs are distinct, each with its own form.

The waxing and waning of flourishing and decline, the currents of transformation and change—

The *exegesis* states: Spring and summer bring flourishing growth, autumn and winter bring decline and decay. Some things transform from life to death, others change from old to new. These principles are spontaneous and not a matter of deliberate intent. Thus, one follows the current and lets things take their course, and all that is accomplished is fitting.

Though Heaven and Earth are most numinous, they still have an order of honor and humility, of precedence and subsequence. How much more so the human Way?

The *annotation* states: The order of honor and humility, of precedence and subsequence, is something even things cannot be without.

The *exegesis* explains: The Two Modes give birth and nurture with unfathomable efficacy, and among the myriad things, they are the most numinous and transformative. Yet even they have distinctions of honor and humility, of precedence and subsequence. How much more so the Way of human relations?

In ancestral temples, kinship is honored; in court, honor is honored; in village communities, seniority is honored; in conduct, worthiness is honored—this is the order of the great Dao.

The *annotation* states: This is not only what human relations honor.

The *exegesis* explains: Ancestral temple affairs are weighty, and the order of *zhāomù* succession must be based on the direct line, thus kinship is honored. In court, official rank determines precedence; in village communities, age determines order; in conduct, the worthy and capable are selected for use. These principles are self-evident, and thus they are called the order of the great Dao.

To speak of the Dao while rejecting its order is not the Dao.

The *exegesis* explains: Those who discuss the principles of the Dao without understanding its order, though they may speak, ultimately do not speak the language of the Dao. Having lost its sequence, it cannot govern things. Those who speak of the Dao yet reject the Dao—how can they grasp the Dao?

The *annotation* states: The reason one grasps the Dao is because it possesses order.

The *exegesis* continues: If one does not recognize its order, though they speak, it is not the Dao. From what, then, can they grasp the Dao to put governance into practice? Thus, those of old who illuminated the great Dao first illuminated Heaven, followed by virtue and power.

The *annotation* states: Heaven is spontaneity. When spontaneity is illuminated, things attain their proper Way.

The *exegesis* elaborates: This further clarifies the sequence of the great Dao. It means that those of old who were well-versed in the great Dao first illuminated the principle of spontaneity. For spontaneity is the root of virtue and power, hence virtue and power follow. Once virtue and power are illuminated, benevolence and righteousness follow.

The *annotation* states: When things attain their proper Way, harmony arises, and principle naturally aligns.

The *exegesis* explains: After losing virtue comes benevolence; after losing benevolence comes righteousness. Thus, benevolence and righteousness follow. Once benevolence and righteousness are illuminated, the observance of distinctions follows.

The *annotation* states: When principle aligns, one does not lose their proper place.

The *exegesis* continues: Having practiced universal love as benevolence and clarified the correction of wrongs as righteousness, next one ensures that each observes their proper place, preventing contention. Once the observance of distinctions is illuminated, the correspondence of form and name follows.

The *annotation* states: When distinctions are observed, the names of things each match their forms.

The *exegesis* explains: *Form* refers to the self. When each observes their proper place without encroachment, next one encourages self-cultivation to establish reputation. Once the correspondence of form and name is illuminated, the principle of following natural endowments follows.

The *annotation* states: No further alteration is needed.

The *exegesis* continues: Though one encourages self-cultivation to attain reputation, all must follow one’s inherent endowments and employ one’s natural disposition. One must not falsify one’s nature or feign emotions to seek fame. Once the principle of following natural endowments is illuminated, the practice of pardon and reduction follows.

The *annotation* states: When each follows their own endowments, blame and responsibility are removed.

The *exegesis* explains: *Pardon* means forgiveness; *reduction* means elimination. Though one follows natural endowments, transgressions may still occur. Thus, it is fitting to extend leniency and forgive their faults. Once pardon and reduction are illuminated, the distinction between right and wrong follows.

The *annotation* states: Each regards attaining their nature as right and losing their nature as wrong.

The *exegesis* continues: Though transgressions are pardoned and faults forgiven, human hearts gradually grow shallow. Next, one must demonstrate right and wrong as a mirror and warning. Once right and wrong are illuminated, rewards and punishments follow.

The *annotation* states: Rewards and punishments are the retribution for loss and gain. The Way of perfect governance begins with Heaven and culminates here.

The *exegesis* explains: Once right and wrong are illuminated, good and evil become apparent. Thus, one rewards the good and punishes the evil to exhort the people. Once rewards and punishments are illuminated, the wise and foolish occupy their proper places, and the noble and base fulfill their stations.

The *annotation* states: Each office accords with its talent.

The *exegesis* continues: Employing these rewards and punishments as sequential methods of governance, the brightness and dullness of wisdom find their proper places, and the high and low of talent all fulfill their stations. The benevolent and worthy, along with the incapable, act according to their natures.

The *annotation* states: Each acts according to their innate abilities.

The *exegesis* explains: The benevolent and worthy are the wise; the incapable are the foolish. *Act* means to employ. When the ruler is sagely and enlightened, transforming and guiding all appropriately, though the wise and foolish differ, all employ their inherent natures. They never force themselves to imitate others or boastfully display their abilities. One must distinguish their abilities.

The *annotation* states: No interchange of duties occurs.

The *exegesis* continues: As natures differ and things vary, skills and talents are inherently distinct. When each is employed like a vessel, none will fail to be well-adjusted. One must follow their names.

The *annotation* states: When names match reality, one follows names to actualize things without pretense.

The *exegesis* explains: Names summon reality, and reality gives rise to names. If reality does not match the name, the name exceeds reality. Here, it is clear that names and reality correspond, hence it is said that one must follow their names. By these means, one serves superiors, nurtures subordinates, governs things, and cultivates the self.

The *exegesis* explains: *By these means* refers to employing the nine preceding methods. Using them, one may serve as a minister to superiors, as a ruler to nurture subordinates, govern things externally, and cultivate the self internally. Wisdom and schemes are not employed; one must return all to Heaven. This is called Great Peace, the ultimate in governance.

The *exegesis* continues: To be utterly quiescent and non-interfering, entrusting all to the people below, closing off cleverness and shutting down wisdom, returning all to spontaneity—this may be called a ruler of Great Peace, the perfection of governance. Thus, the *Book* says: "There are forms and names." Forms and names were possessed by the ancients, yet they were not what came first.

The *exegesis* explains: *First* means the root. It means that methods such as forms and names were merely responses of the sages, employed out of necessity, not what was fundamental. The *Book* refers to a Daoist text. Since it was burned during the Qin dynasty, no reliable evidence remains today. Those of old who spoke of the great Dao underwent five transformations before forms and names could be established, and nine transformations before rewards and punishments could be discussed.

The *annotation* states: From "first illuminating Heaven" to forms and names is five; to rewards and punishments is nine. This is the natural sequence of precedence and subsequence.

The *exegesis* continues: The essence of governance necessarily follows the rise and decline of the age, for the age has its purity and turbidity, and governance has its leniency and strictness. Thus, the five and nine transformations may be established and discussed. If the sequence is not lost, this is Great Peace and perfect governance. To hastily discuss forms and names without knowing their root—

The *exegesis* explains: *Hastily* means repeatedly or swiftly. People of the degenerate age, ignorant of proper order, repeatedly discuss forms and names as methods of governance. Yet they have not fully grasped the nine transformations, taking spontaneity as their foundation. They merely recognize the branches and do not know the root.

Swiftly to speak of rewards and punishments is to be ignorant of their origin.

*The exegesis* explains: To hastily discuss rewards and punishments as a means of governing the age is to see only the branches and not know the root. *Origin* here means *root*—merely a difference in name.

To speak of the Dao in inverted order—those who discourse on it while within the Dao are themselves governed; how can they govern others?

*The annotation* states: To govern others, one must follow the proper sequence.

*The exegesis* explains: *Encounter* means to go against. Those who do not recognize the methods of governance, who know not the proper order, who invert the principles of the Dao and oppose the natural tendencies of things—such men may only be governed by others; how can they govern others?

To hastily speak of forms, names, rewards, and punishments is to possess the tools of governance but not the Way of governance.

*The annotation* states: The Way of governance begins with clarifying Heaven; it does not abandon rewards and punishments, but one must not lose their proper sequence.

*The exegesis* explains: Forms, names, rewards, and punishments are but the tools of governance, not the essential Way of governance. They may be applied to the world, but they are insufficient to employ the world. Such men are called *clever speakers*—men of partial understanding.

*The annotation* states: To employ the world is to fully comprehend the Dao of great harmony and proper sequence.

*The exegesis* explains: If one believes that forms, names, rewards, and punishments may be applied to the world, they are insufficient to employ the world. These are but glib sophists, men of superficial eloquence and partial vision, unfit to discuss the universal Way or awaken to the Great Dao.

Rites, laws, numerical standards, and the detailed comparison of forms and names—these were present among the ancients. They are what inferiors use to serve superiors, not what superiors use to nurture inferiors.

*The annotation* states: To entrust such matters to those of lesser talent is to nurture inferiors.

*The exegesis* explains: Reiterating the previous point: though the ancients employed these methods, they delegated them to subordinates without direct involvement. Thus, they are the affairs of ministers, not the Way by which rulers cultivate the people.

This concludes the chapter’s intent, clarifying the essential relationship between root and branch.

In ancient times, Shun asked Yao: “How does the Son of Heaven apply his mind?”

*The exegesis* explains: *Son of Heaven* means *emperor*. Shun asked Yao about the method of emperors—how to align one’s mind with the Great Dao.

Yao replied: “I do not disdain the uninstructed.”

*The annotation* states: The *uninstructed* refers to the obstinate people.

*The exegesis* explains: *Disdain* means to treat with contempt. The *uninstructed* are those so foolish they cannot be taught. Yao answered Shun, saying: “Even for the most obstinate and ignorant people, whom none can instruct, I still teach them diligently without contempt or abandonment.” Thus, the *Lao Jing* states: “To those who are not good, I also respond with goodness.” Some texts write *disdain* as *pride*, but this is incorrect.

“I do not abandon the destitute.”

*The annotation* states: To bestow compassion without fail.

The *exegesis* explains: Among the common people, there are those who are impoverished—toward them, I always extend relief and compassion, and this resolve never wavers. For those who suffer death, I commend the young and pity the widowed. The *exegesis* states: *Young* refers to infants. *Pity* means to show compassion. When the people suffer death, I grieve and console them. For infants and young children, for women who are widowed and solitary, I always show compassion, commend their goodness, and provide care and relief. This is how I apply my mind.

The *exegesis* explains: *Already* means to cease. Summarizing the foregoing, in response to Shun’s question, this is the full extent of how I apply my mind.

Shun said: “It is fine, indeed, but not yet great.”

The *exegesis* states: To govern with such a mind is fine, indeed, but the Way is narrow and inferior—it does not yet deserve to be called great. Having heard Yao’s answer, Shun thus offered this critique.

Yao said: “Then what should it be?”

The *exegesis* explains: Having been critiqued, Yao thus sought further instruction: How vast is the greatness of the Way of governance?

Shun said: “Align with the virtue of Heaven and emerge in tranquility.”

The *annotation* states: To unite with Heaven’s virtue is to remain still even while active.

The *exegesis* explains: The method of nurturing and transforming aligns with the mysterious virtue of Heaven. Though outwardly manifest, the mind remains ever tranquil. The sun and moon shine, and the four seasons proceed, as constant as the alternation of day and night. Clouds drift and rain falls.

The *annotation* states: All this occurs naturally, without contrivance.

The *exegesis* explains: *Constant* means unchanging. The sun and moon radiate their brilliance, illuminating all within the six directions. Spring and autumn, cold and heat—the four seasons turn in their course. Day and night alternate in clarity and obscurity. Clouds drift and rain descends—all these are the great virtues of Heaven and Earth, the constant Way of nature. Without partiality in mind, how could there be deliberate intent in nurturing and sustaining? The Way of emperors is likewise.

Yao said: “How entangled and troubled I am!”

The *annotation* states: He reproached himself for being too occupied with affairs.

The *exegesis* explains: *Entangled* and *troubled* both describe a state of disorder. Having grasped this teaching, Yao felt his own efforts were excessive and, in humility, furthered the exchange. “You align with Heaven; I align with humanity.”

The *exegesis* explains: Yao humbly deferred, yielding to Shun, saying: Your great virtue perfectly aligns with Heaven above, while my own mind accords only with human affairs. Between Yao and Shun, the two sages, there was no difference in virtue—this was merely to illustrate the two methods of governance.

“The Heaven and Earth—since antiquity, these have been revered as great.”

The *exegesis* states: From this point onward, the words are those of Zhuangzi. Heaven covers and Earth bears; they give life to all things. Among the four great powers of the world, these two stand foremost. Thus, the ancients are cited to affirm the present and praise its attainment.

“And these are what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all esteemed.”

The *exegesis* explains: Only Heaven is great, and only Yao emulated it. Thus, we know that the sovereigns of high antiquity—Xuanyuan, Zhuanxu, Tang, and Yu—all took aligning their virtue with Heaven and Earth as their highest achievement.

“Therefore, those who in ancient times ruled all under Heaven—what did they do? They simply aligned with Heaven and Earth.”

The *exegesis* explains: What did the ancient emperors who embodied the Dao do? They followed things without contrivance, aligning their virtue with the two primal forces.

Confucius went west to deposit his books in the Zhou archives. Zilu counseled, saying: “I have heard that among the Zhou’s archivists, there is an Elder Dan who has resigned and returned home. If you wish to deposit your books, you might visit him and seek his counsel.”

The *exegesis* explains: His surname was Zhong, given name You, courtesy name Zilu, a disciple of Confucius. Seeing that the virtue of Zhou had declined and could not be restored, Confucius wished to deposit his own writings in the Zhou archives, hoping that future rulers might use them as a model for governance. Thus, he consulted his disciples to weigh the matter. Laozi, surnamed Li, given name Dan, served as the Zhou archivist, akin to today’s keeper of records, responsible for the imperial library. Witnessing the decline of the Zhou house, he resigned his post and retired to a life of quietude. Thus, Zilu advised Confucius to visit him and seek his guidance.

Confucius said: “Very well.” He went to see Lao Dan, but Lao Dan refused.

The *exegesis* explains: Laozi knew that the books Confucius wished to deposit were the discarded straw dogs of former sages, not to be preserved lest they confuse later generations. Thus, he refused.

Thereupon, Confucius expounded the Twelve Classics.

The *exegesis* explains: Confucius edited the *Book of Songs* and the *Book of Documents*, established the *Rites* and *Music*, elucidated the *Changes*, and composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals*—these are the Six Classics. Including the *Six Wefts*, they form the Twelve Classics. He unfolded their meanings in detail, thus expounding them thoroughly.

Lao Dan, persuaded by his words, said: “How verbose! I would hear the essentials.”

The *exegesis* explains: *Persuaded by his words* means he acknowledged their validity. *Verbose* means he found the exposition too lengthy and requested the essentials.

Confucius said: “The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness.”

The *exegesis* explains: Though the Twelve Classics are vast, when reduced to their essence, nothing precedes benevolence and righteousness.

Lao Dan said: “May I ask—are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?”

The *exegesis* explains: He asked whether benevolence and righteousness arise from human nature.

Confucius said: “Indeed. The noble person who lacks benevolence cannot achieve completion; without righteousness, they cannot live. Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of humanity—what more is there to say?”

The *exegesis* explains: *Indeed* means “it is so.” Benevolence and righteousness are the great nature of humanity. The noble person who lacks benevolence cannot perfect their name and conduct; without righteousness, their way of life cannot be established. Thus, we know that benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of humanity—why doubt this?

Lao Dan said: “May I ask—what are benevolence and righteousness?”

The *exegesis* explains: Having said that benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of humanity, he now asks further to clarify their origin.

Confucius said: “To delight in the center and harmonize with things, to love universally without partiality—this is the essence of benevolence and righteousness.”

The *annotation* states: These are what ordinary people call benevolence and righteousness, and thus Confucius and Laozi are cited to correct them.

The *exegesis* states: *Kǎi* means joy. A heart of loyalty and sincerity wishes all things to be at peace and happy, with impartial compassion and universal care devoid of selfishness—this truly accords with human nature and may serve as a teaching for the world.

Lao Dan said: “Alas! Your latter words come close to falsehood. Is not universal love overly impractical?”
The *annotation* states: The utmost benevolence advances directly without partiality.
The *exegesis* explains: *Yī* is an exclamation of discontent. *Jǐ* means “near.” *Yū* means “crooked.” Later assertions verge on superficial pretense, hence the sigh of reproach and the cry of indignation. The perfected person follows principle and advances straightforwardly, without deliberate thought, while you cling to the sentiment of universal love—is this not a private and crooked bias? What you call “selflessness” is in truth selfishness.
The *annotation* states: What the world calls “selflessness” is merely abandoning oneself to love others. Yet to love others is to desire their love in return—this is extreme selfishness, not true impartiality born of forgetting the self.
The *exegesis* explains: To love others universally in the hope that they will love you in return—this is extreme selfishness. Where is the impartiality in that? Sir, do you wish to ensure that none in the world lose their proper nurture?
The *exegesis* explains: *Mù* means “to nurture.” If you desire that all under heaven recover their original nature, nothing surpasses each, high and low, abiding in their proper station, preserving tranquility and self-cultivation—thus great order is achieved. Some texts write *mù* as *fàng*, meaning that if the ruler simply lets things follow their natural course, the world will attain great peace. Then the heavens and earth will firmly maintain their constancy, the sun and moon will firmly retain their brightness, the stars and constellations will firmly hold their positions—
The *exegesis* explains: The heavens’ covering and the earth’s bearing, the sun’s and moon’s illumination, the stars’ and constellations’ array—these all follow natural principle, unconnected to human affairs. Not only these three, but all things are so. One should simply let them be. All are fully sufficient—why trouble oneself with anxious contrivance and forced correction? Birds and beasts firmly hold their instincts, trees and plants firmly stand in their places.
The *annotation* states: All are already self-sufficient.
The *exegesis* explains: Sentient creatures and speechless plants, each attains its life and stands in its place, each has its allotted portion. Do they require benevolence and righteousness to achieve this? Sir, you too should let virtue flow freely and follow the Dao in your conduct—thus you will attain perfection.
The *annotation* states: This does not depend on universal love.
The *exegesis* explains: *Xún* means “to follow.” Let your own virtue unfold in carefree wandering through the world, follow the heavenly Dao in your steps among men—no more perfect way exists. Why then do you laboriously uphold benevolence and righteousness, as if beating a drum to seek a runaway child?
The *annotation* states: There is no way to attain this.
The *exegesis* explains: *Kài-kài* describes strenuous effort. *Jiē* means “to carry on the back.” A runaway child is one who has fled. Confucius strains mind and body, carrying benevolence and righteousness on his back, forcing their practice upon the world to teach the common people—how is this different from striking a great drum to seek a runaway child? The louder the drum, the farther the fugitive flees; the more benevolence and righteousness are displayed, the farther the true Dao recedes. Thus there is no way to attain it. Indeed, sir, you confuse people’s nature.
The *annotation* states: To respond to affairs with love when they arise, to act only when righteousness demands—this is to forget benevolence and righteousness. To constantly dwell on them is to disrupt the true.
The *exegesis* explains: The runaway child is not found, the fault lies in the drumming; the true nature is not illuminated, the error lies in benevolence and righteousness. Hence the sigh of reproach serves to conclude the matter.

Shi Chengqi, having met Laozi, asked: “I have heard that you, Master, are a sage. I did not shrink from the long journey to come and pay my respects. A hundred lodgings, blistered feet, yet I dared not rest.”
The *exegesis* explains: His surname was Shi, his given name Chengqi; his place of origin is unknown. *Shè* means “inn.” *Yīn* refers to the blisters and sores from walking. Chengqi had long heard of Laozi’s divine sagely virtue, so he did not shirk hardship, traveling far out of admiration for his teaching. Passing through a hundred inns, he dared not rest, and though the road was long, his feet bore repeated sores.

“Yet now I observe you, and you are no sage. Your rat holes overflow with leftover vegetables—”
The *annotation* states: This shows his disregard for things.
The *exegesis* explains: Formerly, his reputation was great, and he was thought to be a perfected person; today, upon seeing him in person, he finds no sagely virtue. He sees that in the rat holes there are leftover scraps of vegetables, and, finding them filthy, utters this reproach.

“—and you abandon your companions. This is unbenevolent.”
The *annotation* states: Lacking close affection, this is called “abandoning.”
The *exegesis* explains: *Mèi* means “companions.” Those who share one’s obscurity should be guided and advanced. To cast them aside and not teach them—can this be called benevolence?

“Before you, raw and cooked provisions are not exhausted—”
The *annotation* states: Being utterly sufficient, he naturally has surplus.
The *exegesis* explains: *Shēng* refers to grain and silk; *shú* refers to food and drink. Beyond what is sufficient, he does not concern himself, so food and wealth lie scattered before him.

“—yet you amass without limit.”
The *annotation* states: All things return to his embrace; whatever comes is received, without setting narrow boundaries.
The *exegesis* explains: Possessing sagely virtue, he is the refuge of all things, so offerings and collections are without limit. Vast and unconstrained, he accumulates and disperses as things demand.

Laozi remained silent and unresponsive.
The *annotation* states: He did not let the words trouble his mind.
The *exegesis* explains: Words of dust and grime—how could they enter his ears? Calm and indifferent, how could they disturb his heart?

The next day, Shi Chengqi met him again and said: “Yesterday, I spoke critically of you. Now my heart feels empty and stifled—why is this?”
The *annotation* states: He wonders at the critical thoughts that linger in his heart.
The *exegesis* explains: *Yù* means “empty” or “stilled.” Yesterday, upon first arriving, he rashly uttered reproaches; today, reflecting, he realizes his own error. Thus he acknowledges his fault and reproaches himself, his heart deeply troubled and restrained.

The heart is now empty—yet what is this? Unaware, what could it be?

Laozi said: “Those of cunning knowledge and divine sagacity—I have long since cast them off.”
*The annotation* states: *Tuō* means “to pass beyond.”
*The exegesis* explains: Those of cunning knowledge and divine sagacity are but a path of advancement, not one of true attainment. Do you take me for one who aspires to sagehood? I have long since escaped and left it behind—why then do you now call me sage or not-sage? The Old Master sought to curb Chengqi’s critical heart, thus showing him the way to stillness, return, and the root.
Guo’s *annotation* states: *Tuō* means “to pass beyond.” It is to say that I have already transcended and departed from sagehood.

“In the past, when you called me an ox, I answered to ‘ox’; when you called me a horse, I answered to ‘horse.’”
*The annotation* states: Following the name given by things.
If there is true substance, one accepts the name without letting praise or blame trouble the heart.
*The annotation* states: Having substance, one does not take slander or acclaim to heart.
To receive it twice is to invite calamity.
*The annotation* states: To accept both slander and praise in the heart is to be burdened by both name and reality—thus one invites calamity twice over.
*The exegesis* explains: Yesterday, when you mocked me as an ox, I followed and answered to ‘ox’; when you called me a horse, I followed and answered to ‘horse’—I never refused. Yet if one truly possesses the substance of ox or horse, to reject the name given by others is to invite a second calamity. The words of mockery were no worse than ‘ox’ or ‘horse’—if I did not reject those, how much less would I reject anything else?

“My bearing remains ever constant.”
*The annotation* states: *Fú* refers to one’s demeanor and conduct. Not letting slander or praise bring harm upon oneself, one’s countenance remains unchanged.
*The exegesis* explains: Guo’s *annotation* states: *Fú* refers to one’s demeanor and conduct. The Old Master embodied the great sagacity of the Dao, thus he could master his body and mind, maintaining his bearing and accepting all—whether called ox or horse, he followed things as they were. This was his constant way, not something he contrived.
“I do not maintain this bearing *because* I have a bearing.”
*The annotation* states: To act with intention is to be unable to maintain constancy.
*The exegesis* explains: I follow my nature and act with spontaneity, accepting things as they come—this is not something achieved by deliberate effort. To force the heart is to distort one’s nature; to act with intention is to depart from non-action.

Shi Chengqi walked like a crow, avoiding his own shadow, and followed behind, advancing cautiously to ask: “How should one cultivate the self?”
*The exegesis* explains: Chengqi, realizing his error, felt shame in body and heart. Thus he walked obliquely, stepping aside to avoid his shadow, following behind Laozi without daring to tread in his steps. He advanced slowly and asked how to cultivate the self.

Laozi said: “Your countenance is steep and towering,”
*The annotation* states: The appearance of restless haste.
*The exegesis* explains: *Ér* means “you.” Your adorned demeanor seeks to impress others, erecting a lofty barrier—you cannot be at ease.
“your gaze is piercing and darting,”
*The annotation* states: The appearance of sharp intensity.
*The exegesis* explains: With an unsettled heart, your eyes rove restlessly—glancing left and right, your gaze is sharp and unsettling.
“your brow is haughty and exposed,”
*The annotation* states: The appearance of proudly displaying one’s beauty.
*The exegesis* explains: Your forehead is raised high, flaunting your adornments—with such bearing, you hold yourself aloof from others.
“your mouth is gaping and fierce,”
*The annotation* states: The appearance of ferocity and openness.
*The exegesis* explains: Guo’s *annotation* states: The appearance of ferocity and openness. Your nature is stubborn and overbearing, your words bold and intimidating—your boastful openness makes you fearsome.
“your manner is imposing and self-possessed,”
*The annotation* states: The appearance of stiff self-control.
*The exegesis* explains: *Yì* means “to display.” Your haughty arrogance violates the humility of ritual propriety, yet you adorn your manner to appear fitting.
“as if reined in while longing to gallop.”
*The annotation* states: Your heart is set on running wild.
*The exegesis* explains: Though your form is restrained, your heart is restless—like a swift horse held back, your mind is set on flight.

“You move with restraint,”
*The annotation* states: Unable to be free and at ease.
*The exegesis* explains: Your emotions chase after things, reacting to every encounter—unable to act with spontaneity, you cling to restraint in all things.
“your reactions are swift as a trigger,”
*The annotation* states: Quick to align with circumstances.
*The exegesis* explains: *Jī* means “crossbow trigger.” Your heart, poised to seize, reacts to circumstances with sudden force—your responses are as swift as a loosed arrow.
“you observe with scrutiny,”
*The annotation* states: Discerning right and wrong.
*The exegesis* explains: Unable to let go and forget, to merge with the flow and forget both—you keenly observe right and wrong, your heart bound by judgment.
“your knowledge is clever yet fixated on excess,”
*The annotation* states: *Tài* means “to exceed one’s inherent nature.” To be clever in seeing excess is to be clumsy in embracing simplicity.
*The exegesis* explains: *Tài* means “excess.” Unable to forget cleverness and knowledge, to perceive the principle of non-action—you feign wisdom and skill, seeing only the busyness of action.
“All this is untrustworthy.”
*The annotation* states: All these ten things, being untrue to one’s nature and swayed by praise or blame, are not the way to cultivate the self.
*The exegesis* explains: *Xìn* means “real.” These ten things are all deceptive conduct, not the true virtue of the self.

“At the borderlands there is one called ‘the Thief.’”
*The annotation* states: Like your conduct—this is not the way of the upright.
*The exegesis* explains: *Qiè* means “thief.” At the frontier, there suddenly appears one who disregards laws and customs, acting only as a thief. Within, he corrupts moral standards; without, he disrupts relations with neighboring lands—no greater harm exists. Chengqi’s conduct is just as base—his every move is like this thief.

The Master said: “The Dao—great, it is not exhausted; small, it is not overlooked. Thus it embraces all things.”
*The exegesis* explains: Zhuangzi followed the Old Master, thus he addressed him as *fūzǐ*. *Zhōng* means “to exhaust.” Though the Two Modes are vast, they remain within the Dao—its measure cannot be exhausted.

The autumn down, though minute, awaits its completion to form a body—this is "in the small, nothing is overlooked." Since it can be both small and great, we know all things are encompassed within it. Vast, vast—there is nothing it does not contain; profound, profound—it cannot be fathomed.

*The exegesis* explains: Since it embraces all that is great without exclusion and penetrates all that is fine without omission, threading through the ten thousand things and enveloping the Two Modes, it is thus called "vast, vast" to praise its boundless breadth, and "profound, profound" to extol its unfathomable depth.

Form, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the outermost branches of the spirit—who but the Perfected could rightly assess them?

*The exegesis* explains: Form, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are merely the final traces of the spirit, not its true essence. They are remedies for the world’s ills, employed only when unavoidable. If not for the sagely and divine Perfected, who could determine their coarse or refined nature?

The Perfected engages with the world—is this not vast? Yet it does not burden him.

*The annotation* states: Engaging with the world, he does not cease to be vast.

*The exegesis* explains: The sage’s power spans the myriad chariots, ruling over the world, enthroned in the ninth of the five positions—is this not vast? Yet like one dwelling on Mount Guye or by the Fen River, he forgets things and forgets himself, moving yet still, at rest yet in motion—how could the four seas burden him?

The world may surge and clamor, but he does not follow its course.

*The annotation* states: Abiding in stillness, he accords with it.

The *exegesis* explains: "Stock" signifies expedient means. "Accompany" means to join together. When the altars of state topple and the realm crumbles, those who chase the world rush to wield their expedient means. Yet the Perfected remains still and self-contained, refusing to race alongside them. Discerning that nothing is borrowed and thus not swayed by profit,

*The annotation* states: He follows his true nature and proceeds directly.

*The exegesis* explains: His nature abides in stillness, entrusting himself to fate and following his true nature. With honor and rank no longer touching his heart, how could wealth and gain move him? He exhausts the true essence of things and is able to guard their root.

*The exegesis* explains: The sage’s spirit penetrates all, exhausting principle and fulfilling his nature—this is what it means to exhaust the true essence of things. Yet his responses are boundless, his movements never disturbing his stillness, for he guards their root. Thus he transcends Heaven and Earth, leaves the myriad things behind, and his spirit is never troubled.

*The exegesis* explains: Though he grasps the charts and governs the realm, unifying the four directions, he forgets the two primal forces and abandons the myriad things. Thus, with non-action, he accomplishes nothing, his mind at ease and his spirit flourishing—what weariness could there be? He penetrates the Dao and unites with virtue.

*The exegesis* explains: His heart of tranquility penetrates the supreme Dao; his wisdom of emptiness and forgetting accords with the highest virtue. Here, realm and wisdom merge, and ability and object become one. He retreats from benevolence and righteousness,

*The annotation* states: He advances the Dao and virtue.

He sets ritual and music aside,

*The annotation* states: He takes essence and nature as his foundation.

*The exegesis* explains: He retreats from the shallowness of benevolence and righteousness, advancing the purity of the Dao and virtue. He sets aside the superficiality of ritual and music, embracing the emptiness and tranquility of non-action. The heart of the Perfected is thus settled.

*The annotation* states: Settled in non-action.

*The exegesis* explains: Tranquil and inactive, his actions never stray from stillness—he is settled.

The world values the Dao as expressed in books,

*The exegesis* explains: "Dao" refers to speech; "books" refer to writing. The worldly see only the superficial, sometimes relying on words to convey the heart, sometimes using writing to express meaning. They exchange these back and forth, prizing them highly, unaware that nothing is truly worth saying. Books are but words, and words have their value. What is valued in words is their meaning.

*The exegesis* explains: The purpose of writing is to convey words; the purpose of words is to express meaning. Meaning has its source. What meaning follows cannot be transmitted through words,

*The exegesis* explains: "Follows" means to derive from. Meaning arises from the Dao, and the Dao is neither form nor sound—thus it cannot be transmitted through words. Yet the world values the transmission of words through books. Though the world values them, they are still not truly worthy of value, for what they value is not truly valuable.

*The annotation* states: What is truly valuable always lies beyond words and meaning.

*The exegesis* explains: Books carry words, and words convey meaning. Yet people of later ages, their hearts and spirits obscured, value words and prize books, unable to forget words and seek principle. Thus, though they value them, they are still not truly worthy of value, for words and books are but dregs, not things of true worth. As Master Guo’s annotation says, what is truly valuable always lies beyond meaning. What can be seen is form and color; what can be heard is name and sound. Alas! The world takes form, color, name, and sound as sufficient to grasp the true nature of things. Yet form, color, name, and sound are indeed insufficient to grasp their true nature.

*The annotation* states: Only those who forget words and abandon books can grasp their true nature.

*The exegesis* explains: What the eye sees is nothing beyond form and color; what the ear hears is nothing beyond name and sound. Yet the worldly, failing to comprehend the supreme principle, believe that names, words, sounds, and colors exhaust the true reality of the Dao. How could they know the profound mystery, where seeing and hearing cannot reach? Such delusion is deeply lamentable. As Master Guo’s annotation says, only those who forget words and abandon books can grasp their true nature. Thus, those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not know—yet how could the world recognize this?

*The annotation* states: This is the meaning of cutting off learning and abandoning knowledge.

*The exegesis* explains: Those who know the Dao forget words; those who value virtue do not know. Yet the deaf and blind masses, lost in ignorance, how could they awaken? Only those who truly understand can embody this.

Duke Huan was reading in the hall. Below, Wheelwright Bian was carving a wheel. Setting aside his mallet and chisel, he ascended and asked Duke Huan, "May I ask, what words are those Your Lordship reads?"

*The exegesis* explains: Duke Huan was Duke Huan of Qi. "Wheel" refers to a carriage wheel. "Bian" was the name of the craftsman. "Carving" means shaping wood. "Setting aside" means putting down. The lord of Qi was reading, while the wheelwright was crafting a wheel—noble and common, their tasks different. Yet he put down his tools to pose a question, intending to show that the supreme Dao is profoundly mysterious and cannot be transmitted or collected. Thus, through Duke Huan and the craftsman, he briefly reveals the essence of forgetting words.

Duke Huan said, "The words of the sages."

*The exegesis* explains: These are the teachings that follow the models of Wen and Wu, tracing back to Yao and Shun—words of the sages.

Bian asked, "Are the sages still alive?"

*The exegesis* explains: He further asked whether the sages were still present.

Duke Huan said, "They have already died."

*The exegesis* explains: He replied that though the sages had died, their teachings remained.

Bian said, "Then what Your Lordship reads are but the dregs and lees of the ancients."

*The exegesis* explains: The sediment of wine is called "dregs"; the lees are called "lees." The pure wine is likened to the Dao and virtue, while the dregs and lees are compared to benevolence and righteousness—like straw dogs already discarded, what are they worth?

Duke Huan said, "I am reading—how dare a wheelwright pass judgment? If you have an explanation, it will do; if not, you will die."

*The exegesis* explains: Noble and common are separated by ritual; one cannot speak lightly. How dare a humble craftsman presume to comment? If his explanation holds reason, he may be spared; if he has no words, he will incur the death penalty.

Wheelwright Bian said, "Your servant observes this through his own work. When carving a wheel, if done too slowly, it is smooth but not firm; if done too quickly, it is rough and does not fit."

Neither too slow nor too swift—grasped by the hand and responding to the heart, yet inexpressible in words, for a principle resides within. *The exegesis* explains: "Sweet" means slow; "bitter," hasty. "Principle" means the proper measure. If the wheel is not made just so, it will seldom be firm; if it is made well, the mouth cannot describe it. The same holds for the principles of teaching. I cannot make my own son understand, nor can my son receive it from me—thus, though I am seventy years old, I still labor at wheel-carving.

*The annotation* states: This speaks of how things each have their nature, and how teaching and learning are of no avail.

*The exegesis* explains: "Make understand" means to enlighten. Wheelwright Bian of Qi could not demonstrate it to his son, nor could his son inherit his teaching. Thus, though he has reached old age, he does not cease the toil of axe and adze. From this we know that things each have their nature and cannot be imitated. The ancients and what they could not transmit have perished; what you, my lord, are reading are but the dregs and lees of the ancients.

*The annotation* states: The affairs of the ancients have vanished into antiquity. Even if some traces remain, how can they make the past present again? Since the past is not the present, and present affairs have already changed, one must abandon learning, follow one’s nature, and adapt to the times to attain the Way.

*The exegesis* explains: The sages established laws to benefit the world according to the times. Since time does not stand still, the laws must also change. Thus, the ancients and their laws have decayed in the past, while new laws and new people arise in the present—there is no need to cling to the ancient sages and apply their ways to the present age. Therefore, what you read are surely the dregs and lees.

*The Zhuangzi: The Pure Classic of Nanhua, with Annotations and Exegesis*, Volume Fifteen, concludes here.

The Tang dynasty Master of Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying, *Exegesis*
*Outer Chapters: "Heaven’s Revolution"* (Chapter Fourteen)

Does Heaven revolve?
**Annotation:** It does not revolve yet moves of itself.
**Exegesis:** Heaven, endowed with yang qi, is light and floats above; though without intent, it moves of itself.

Does Earth abide?
**Annotation:** It does not abide yet rests of itself.
**Exegesis:** Earth, endowed with yin qi, is heavy and sinks below; though without intent, it remains still of itself.

Do the sun and moon contend for their place?
**Annotation:** They do not contend for place yet alternate and wane of themselves.
**Exegesis:** Illuminating day and night, rising and setting in succession—such is their natural course. Since they are without feeling in their alternation, how could they possess intent in contending for place?

Who directs this?
**Exegesis:** *Shu* means "who." *This* refers to the foregoing. The four seasons and eight solar terms, the movement of clouds and descent of rain, the nurturing of all living things and the fostering of all beings—who is the master that governs and enacts this? This phrase explains Heaven’s revolution.

Who binds and orders this?
**Annotation:** All is thus of itself.

The mountains and peaks give birth and nurture, the rivers and springs flow and pour, embracing the myriad things, bearing them endlessly. Spring gives rise, summer fosters growth—all without the slightest error. Who upholds and orders this, that it may be thus? This phrase explains Earth’s station.

Who, dwelling in nonaction, propels and enacts this?
**Annotation:** Without nothing, there would be nothing to propel; with being, each has its own affairs. Yet who, dwelling in nonaction, propels and enacts this? Each moves of itself.
**Exegesis:** The sun and moon alternate and wane, the stars and constellations shine brightly, each following its own measure—all proceeding from the natural. Who, abiding in nonaction, calculates and enacts this? This phrase explains the contention of sun and moon for place.

The three foregoing instances all pose hypothetical questions to reveal what is subtle. Thus we know all moves of itself, with no thing causing it to be so.

Or is there some mechanism, some closure, that compels it of necessity?
**Exegesis:** *Mechanism* means a trigger; *closure*, a seal. In the depths of winter, when all is stern and withering, or in the dark of night, when all is dim and obscure, one might surmise that some master governs the trigger and seal, that things proceed of necessity and cannot be otherwise. Yet when one examines the principle, all moves of itself. The stillness of Earth follows the same pattern.

Or does it revolve and turn, unable to halt of itself?
**Annotation:** It moves of itself, and thus cannot be known.
**Exegesis:** When spring’s vital breath stirs, the myriad things all come to life; when day and night open in clarity, the six directions are all illumined. The sequence of qi revolves and turns, bringing forth this nurturing and growth. Yet when one traces the principle, no thing causes it to be so. The revolution of the round heavens follows the same pattern.

Do clouds give rise to rain? Does rain give rise to clouds?
**Annotation:** Neither can give rise to the other; each moves of itself.
**Exegesis:** When qi ascends and rises, it becomes clouds; when clouds disperse and descend, they flow and moisten to form rain. Yet when one traces their beginning and end, there is no origin to be found. Thus we know neither gives rise to the other.

Who causes them to swell and recede?
**Exegesis:** *Swelling* means to arise; *receding*, to cease. Who brings forth clouds and rain to pour in torrents, who withholds sweet moisture to bring this drought?

Who, dwelling in nonaction, indulges in excess and urges this on?
**Exegesis:** Who, abiding in nonaction, spurs itself on to create this excessive rain for its own delight? The *Shima* edition reads *weary* instead of *urge*.

The wind rises in the north, now west, now east, drifting and hovering aloft. Who breathes it in and out? Who, dwelling in nonaction, fans and stirs it?
**Exegesis:** *Drifting and hovering* describes its turning and circling. *Breathing in and out* is like exhaling and inhaling. *Fanning and stirring* is like waving and moving. The north is the source of yin qi, whence the wind arises. The wind blows without intent, now east, now west, as it pleases. Sometimes it drifts and hovers in the void, sometimes it breathes in and out among the mountains, fanning and stirring as it rises and falls, with no fixed pattern. Who, dwelling in nonaction, does this? It is simply the natural.

May I ask why?
**Annotation:** This poses a question about the reason for its moving of itself.
**Exegesis:** This phrase asks in summary: what is the reason for all that has come before?

Wu Xian summoned and said: Come. I shall tell you.

The heavens possess the Six Ultimates and the Five Constants.
**Annotation:** For matters close at hand, one may know their causes, yet tracing their origins to the ultimate reveals no cause—they simply are so. If they are so of themselves, there is no need to inquire further into their cause; one should merely follow them.
**Exegesis:** Wu Xian was a divine shaman and minister to King Zhong of Yin. *Zhao* is his name. The Six Ultimates refer to the six directions: the four cardinal points, above, and below. The Five Constants are the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—the enduring natures of human relations. The principle of the natural encompasses these Six Ultimates and Five Constants, extending even to the sun, moon, wind, and clouds. All follow this pattern; one should simply allow them to unfold, for they are complete in themselves. Why trouble oneself with questioning them? When rulers follow this principle, there is order; when they oppose it, there is misfortune.
**Annotation:** What is acquired through learning may be altered, but one’s heavenly nature cannot be defied.
**Exegesis:** The ruler, aligning above with the Dao of Heaven and below with the people, governs with effortless nonaction, following the natural course of things—thus the realm is well-ordered. But to defy the joy of all under heaven and disrupt the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth, engaging in reckless conduct, invites calamity and chaos. When the affairs of the Nine Regions and the Luo settlements are well-managed, virtue is perfected, and the land below is illuminated.
**Exegesis:** The affairs of the Nine Regions and the Luo refer to the governance of the nine provinces and their settlements. When the ruler responds to Heaven and follows the natural course of things, governing without intent, the realm attains great peace, and the people rejoice. The lands of the Nine Regions and their settlements are well-ordered, their achievements complete; the distant lands of the Eight Wastes and the barbarian tribes are perfected in Dao and virtue. Aligning with the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth), they cover and sustain the myriad things; equaling the Three Luminaries (sun, moon, stars), they illuminate the land below. When the world bears this burden, it is called the governance of the Supreme Sovereign.
**Annotation:** This is because they follow what is so of itself.
**Exegesis:** When the Dao accords with the natural and virtue equals creation, the people willingly uphold it without weariness, and the common folk bear its weight without complaint. This is the return to simplicity and the restoration of purity—the governance of the Supreme Sovereign.

The Grand Steward of Song, Dang, asked Zhuangzi about benevolence.
**Exegesis:** Song succeeded the Yin, so Song is here referred to as Shang. *Grand Steward* is an official title; his name was Ying, and his courtesy name was Dang. Seeking to resolve his doubts, he asked Zhuangzi about benevolence.
Zhuangzi said: Tigers and wolves are benevolent.
**Exegesis:** Benevolence is the advance of affection and love. Even fierce beasts like tigers and wolves know mutual affection, demonstrating that all things possess the nature of benevolence.
Dang asked: What do you mean?
**Exegesis:** The Grand Steward, not grasping the deeper meaning, asked again what this implied.
Zhuangzi said: Father and son are affectionate—how is this not benevolent?
**Exegesis:** The love between father and son arises naturally—this is true benevolence; why ask further?
Dang said: May I ask about perfect benevolence?
**Exegesis:** The affection of tigers and wolves is limited in scope, so he asked about perfect benevolence, hoping to hear its profound meaning.
Zhuangzi said: Perfect benevolence has no affection.
**Annotation:** *No affection* does not mean coldness or aversion. The human body itself has no inherent affection: the head naturally resides above, the feet below, the organs within, and the skin and hair without. Above and below, within and without, noble and base, humble and exalted—each part of the body fulfills its function to the utmost, yet there is no affection among them. This is sufficient in itself. Thus, the five relations, the six clans, the worthy and the foolish, the near and the far—none lose their proper place in the world. This is the principle of the natural; what need is there for affection?
**Exegesis:** Perfect benevolence forgets concerns and severs deliberation, uniting with the Great Void as one body, merging the myriad things into a single whole. How can one speak of affection or estrangement? It is utterly without intent, yet follows the world’s affections and estrangements.
The Grand Steward said: I have heard that without affection, there is no love; without love, there is no filial piety. Can one say that perfect benevolence is unfilial?
**Exegesis:** Without love and affection, there is no filial piety. To call perfect benevolence unfilial—is this acceptable? Shang Dang, failing to grasp the profound meaning, fell into shallow confusion. Zhuangzi refuted him plainly, as explained below.
Zhuangzi said: Not so. Perfect benevolence is lofty indeed; filial piety is simply insufficient to describe it.
**Annotation:** Only when words reach the realm of forgetting benevolence and forgetting filial piety does one attain perfection.
**Exegesis:** Perfect benevolence forgets rightness and benevolence—it is noble and exalted. How can one speak of it in terms of the near and familiar, like love and respect? It is simply insufficient to describe it. This is not a statement that surpasses filial piety but one that does not reach it.
**Annotation:** All names arise from what they do not reach. Only by transcending the name of "sevenfold filial piety" and entering the realm of the nameless does one attain perfection.
**Exegesis:** The Grand Steward’s question was mired in conventional bounds, while Zhuangzi’s answer soared beyond them. Thus, the meaning of affection is not a discourse that surpasses filial piety but one that, clinging to names and teachings, does not reach it. One who travels south to Ying, facing north, does not see Mount Ming—why? Because it is too far away.
**Annotation:** Mount Ming lies in the northernmost reaches, yet one travels south to observe it. Perfect benevolence resides in having no affection, yet one speaks of it in terms of benevolence and love. Thus, though Ying is visible, Mount Ming grows ever more distant; though benevolence and filial piety are manifest, they grow ever further from the perfect principle.
**Exegesis:** Ying lies in the south, Mount Ming in the north. As Master Guo notes: Mount Ming is in the northernmost reaches, yet one travels south to observe it. Perfect transformation resides in having no affection, yet one speaks of it in terms of benevolence and love. Thus, though Ying is visible, Mount Ming grows ever more distant; though benevolence and filial piety are manifest, they grow ever further from the perfect Dao. This annotation is quite clear and requires no further explanation.
Therefore, it is said: Filial piety through respect is easy; filial piety through love is difficult.
**Exegesis:** Respect lies in outward conduct, while love arises from the heart’s nature. The heart follows heavenly nature, so it is difficult; meeting others’ expectations is a matter of human sentiment, so it is easy.

To love and be filial is easy, yet to forget one’s kin is difficult.
**Exegesis:** Though loving and being filial is difficult, it still lingers within the bounds of attachment; it does not compare to forgetting one’s kin, which is serene and free from entanglement. The will surpasses love, yet even this is inferior to non-attachment. By this measure, the difficulty and ease are made clear.

To forget one’s kin is easy; to make one’s kin forget oneself is difficult.
**Exegesis:** Tigers leaping and severing their bowels, old cows licking their calves—benevolence flows downward, an innate nature of all beings. Thus, for a child to forget its parents is easy, but for parents to forget their child is difficult. Without attaining the Dao, who could practice this?

To make one’s kin forget oneself is easy; to forget the world entirely is difficult.
To forget the world entirely is easy; to make the world forget oneself entirely is difficult.
**Annotation:** The perfectly benevolent one finds all limbs at ease, so that even after a full day, they do not recognize themselves. When the sage rules from above, they do not act forcibly but allow all things to attain their own fulfillment. When each attains their own way, all affairs naturally find harmony, and all living beings are self-sufficient. How could the world not forget itself? When all forget themselves, where then does the ruler reside? This is what is meant by "forgetting entirely."

**Exegesis:** To forget the world entirely is to cast aside the throne of ten thousand chariots as easily as removing a shoe. To make the world forget oneself entirely is to have the people act in daily life without awareness. Ruling with folded arms at Fenyang while roaming in thought to Guye—such is the beauty of yielding and forgetting, comparable to forgetting the world entirely. Yet this is still difficult when measured against what precedes it, and easier when compared to what follows. It does not match the state of forgetting the supreme Dao, stilling wisdom to return to nature, aligning with the transformations of creation and merging virtue with heaven and earth. Thus, one allows the nature of all things to unfold, follows the inclinations of the people, and ensures that great and small alike find their place, neither birds nor fish lost. Beneficence flows unseen, and all things are as they are: the ruler stands as a mere branch, the people roam like wild deer. At such a time, where does the ruler reside? This is what it means to make the world forget oneself entirely—such were the sovereigns before Xuanyuan and Zhuanxu, the rulers of ancient simplicity. Their virtue was unseen, so the world forgot them. This is the progression from inferior to superior, from coarse to subtle, shedding and shedding again, profound and ever more profound.

To leave behind the virtue of Yao and Shun and not act upon it—
**Annotation:** Only by leaving Yao and Shun behind is their virtue made complete; if it remains bound in the heart, it is not true self-attainment.
**Exegesis:** To leave behind is to forget and cast aside. Yao and Shun, those two sovereigns, possessed virtue vast and deep, yet they forgot even their virtue, allowing things to follow their course without interference. This explains why making the world forget oneself entirely is difficult.

Their beneficence extended to ten thousand generations, yet the world knew nothing of it.
**Annotation:** Ever at ease, ever constant.
**Exegesis:** Their beneficence and grace nourished all living beings, and even after ten thousand generations, their virtue did not fade. Yet their perfect power flowed unseen, and the people lived without awareness. This explains why making the world forget oneself entirely is difficult.

How could one merely sigh and speak of benevolence and filial piety?
**Annotation:** Lost in rivers and lakes, one then longs for a drop of moisture.
**Exegesis:** To sigh is to lament. If even one of such virtue, equal to Yao and Shun, could forget and not display themselves, how could they sigh over transforming filial piety or lament over superficial offerings? Filial devotion, fraternal respect, benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and incorruptibility—these are all self-exertions that labor one’s virtue. They are not worthy of praise.
**Exegesis:** Fraternal respect is obedience. Virtue is one’s true nature. These eight qualities are all contrived, forced efforts that imitate others and labor one’s nature. Thus, they are not worthy of praise.

Therefore, it is said: The most noble casts aside state rank;
**Annotation:** To cast aside is to discard. If one forgets even one’s own body, how much more state rank? This is the height of nobility.
**Exegesis:** To cast aside is to discard. State rank and emoluments exist for the sake of the body. If one forgets even the body, how much more rank and emoluments? This is the height of nobility.

The richest casts aside state wealth;
**Annotation:** The richest is self-sufficient, thus discarding the wealth of the world.
**Exegesis:** The richest is one who knows contentment. One who knows contentment treasures non-attachment; even if the wealth of the state were offered, they would cast it aside and not use it. Thus, the *Laozi* says, "One who knows contentment is rich." This is what is meant.

The most fulfilled casts aside fame and reputation.
**Annotation:** The ultimate fulfillment is contentment; when contentment is attained, the names of benevolence and filial piety are all gone.
**Exegesis:** The ultimate fulfillment is nothing more than following one’s nature. Once one unites praise and blame, blends honor and disgrace, forgets self and others, and dissolves right and wrong, then fame and reputation are viewed as spittle. Thus, the Dao does not change.
**Annotation:** Casting aside the ornamental for the essential.
**Exegesis:** To change is to alter or perish. Having forgotten wealth and rank and discarded fame and reputation, the Dao remains pure and thick, not shifting with external things.

Beimen Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor: "When Your Majesty performed the *Xianchi* music in the wilds of Dongting—"
**Exegesis:** Beimen was his surname, Cheng his given name, a minister of the Yellow Emperor. To clarify the way of supreme music, he introduced these two figures to engage in dialogue. *Xianchi* is the name of the music. To perform is to present. *Xian* means harmony or greatness. The wilds of Dongting refer to the space between heaven and earth, not Lake Dongting.
"I was first afraid upon hearing it, then weary upon hearing it again, and finally bewildered upon hearing it to the end."
**Exegesis:** Weary means to retreat or slacken. Finally means in the end. Again means repeatedly. Bewildered means to unite. Not comprehending the supreme music, at first hearing, he was startled and fearful; upon hearing it again, he pondered the notes and his fear subsided; upon hearing it to the end, he realized that supreme music harmonizes with the two powers, is invisible to the eye and inaudible to the ear, and thus his mind became undifferentiated, like one in darkness.

Vast and silent, one loses all sense of self.
**Annotation:** Losing all sense of self refers to "sitting in forgetfulness."
**Exegesis:** *Dangdang* describes an even and unobstructed bearing; *momo*, an appearance of utter ignorance. Upon the third hearing, one embodies and awakens to the profound principle, thus becoming *dangdang* without bias, *momo* without knowledge—suddenly sitting in forgetfulness, where self and other both vanish, and one loses all sense of self.

The Emperor said: "You have nearly grasped it.
I perform it through humanity, harmonize it with heaven, conduct it with ritual propriety, and establish it in the Great Purity.
**Annotation:** From this we see that the supreme music is not merely a matter of sound. It must first accord with heaven, respond to humanity, resonate in the heart, and suit one’s nature—only then is it expressed in sound and performed in melody. Thus, the music of *Xianchi* awaited the transformation of the Yellow Emperor before reaching completion.
**Exegesis:** *Dai* means "nearly." *Zou* means "to respond." *Hui* means "to accord." Ritual propriety refers to the Five Virtues. The Great Purity is the Way of Heaven. After the third hearing, Yunmen Cheng attained realization of the profound Dao, his will stilled and his thoughts calmed. Thus, the Emperor acknowledged his understanding, saying, "You have nearly aligned with nature." The supreme music first responds to human affairs, accords with heavenly principles, is conducted through the Five Virtues, and resonates with spontaneity—only then does it regulate the four seasons and harmonize the myriad things.
**Exegesis:** Though it proceeds through the advancement of ritual propriety, it does not forget the root of spontaneity. This is the first performance.

The four seasons arise in succession, and the myriad things follow their birth;
Now flourishing, now withering, the patterns of civil and martial order endure.
**Exegesis:** *Xun* means "to follow"; *lun*, "principle"; *jing*, "constant." The four seasons—spring, summer, autumn, winter—arise in succession, and the myriad things are born in orderly sequence. Summer flourishes, winter withers; spring is civil, autumn martial. The principles of generation and destruction are the constant Way of Heaven. Simply following them is the supreme music.

Now clear, now turbid, yin and yang harmonize, their radiance flowing in sound.
**Annotation:** The natural pitch-pipes fill the space between heaven and earth. One must simply follow without interference, and the supreme music will be complete.
**Exegesis:** Clear is heaven; turbid, earth. Yin ascends and yang descends, the two qi harmonizing to generate the myriad things. The harmonious qi flows and spreads, the Three Luminaries shine forth—this is the supreme music, the soundless sound.

When the hibernating creatures first stir, I startle them with thunder;
**Annotation:** Employing what naturally moves them.
**Exegesis:** In the second month of spring, hibernating creatures begin to awaken. This is the natural principle. Startling them with thunder exemplifies acting in accord with the seasons, responding to things as they arise. The supreme music fully embodies this Way.

In the end, it has no tail; in the beginning, no head.
**Annotation:** Revolving without limit.
**Exegesis:** Seeking the principle of spontaneity, there is no beginning and no end. Discussing the sound of the supreme music, there is no head and no tail. Thus, the *Laozi* says: "When you meet it, you do not see its head; when you follow it, you do not see its rear."

Now dying, now living; now falling, now rising—what is constant knows no end.
**Annotation:** Taking transformation as constant, then what is constant is without end.
**Exegesis:** *Fen* means "to fall." Flourishing and withering, life and death, emptiness and fullness, rising and falling—such is the Way of transformation, the constant pattern of principle. If one takes transformation as constant, then what is called constant knows no end.

Yet the One cannot be awaited. This is why you were afraid.
**Annotation:** Initially hearing the endless transformations, one cannot await them with the One, thus trembling in fear.
**Exegesis:** The principle of the supreme One is beyond sight and sound; it cannot be awaited with form or voice. Thus, at first hearing, one trembles in fear.

I then perform it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminating it with the brightness of sun and moon.
**Annotation:** This is what is meant by employing the Way of Heaven.
**Exegesis:** The sound of the supreme music harmonizes yin and yang in their proper order. What it communicates to living things equals the brightness of sun and moon. This is the second performance.

Its sound may be short or long, soft or hard;
Transforming and uniting as one, it does not adhere to fixed constancy.
**Annotation:** United in transformation, it does not adhere to fixed constancy.
**Exegesis:** Adapting to the length or brevity of life’s flourishing, accommodating the softness or hardness of the myriad things, uniting in the principle of transformation—how could it cling to the old and hold to constancy?

Where there is a valley, it fills the valley; where there is a pit, it fills the pit.
**Annotation:** The Way of the supreme music is all-pervading.
**Exegesis:** The Way of the supreme music is boundless, filling every pit and valley without exception. All is without. This is what is meant by the Dao being nowhere absent, yet wherever it is, it is without form.

Seal the senses and guard the spirit.
**Annotation:** Blocking the apertures.
**Exegesis:** *Tu* means "to block"; *na*, "apertures." Close the apertures of the heart’s knowledge and guard the spirit in serene stillness. As Guo’s annotation says: "Blocking the apertures."

Taking things as the measure,
**Annotation:** The great system is uncut.
**Exegesis:** *Liang* is pronounced *liàng*. Whether large or small, long or short, one follows the capacity of things, never cutting or shaping them to one’s own will.

Its sound resounds and expands,
**Annotation:** What is called unfolding harmony.
**Exegesis:** *Hui* means "to move"; *chuo*, "to expand." Like the shaking of thunder, its sound is vast.

Its name is lofty and luminous.
**Annotation:** When its name matches reality, it is lofty and luminous.
**Exegesis:** Lofty as the heavens above, luminous as sun and moon—its sound being so vast, its name is likewise lofty and luminous.

Thus, ghosts and spirits guard their hidden realms,
**Annotation:** Not departing from their proper places.
**Exegesis:** Humans and things dwell in the manifest, while ghosts and spirits guard the hidden. Each attains its proper place without interference. Thus, the *Laozi* says: "When the Dao benefits the world, its ghosts do not haunt."

And the sun, moon, and stars follow their courses."

The three luminaries shine brightly, moving according to their allotted measures,
**Annotation:** Not deviating from their proper bounds.
**Exegesis:** The three lights radiate, following their ordained paths; their celestial patterns are upheld by the Supreme Mystery, without the slightest error.

I rest it in the finite,
**Annotation:** Ever abiding at the utmost limit.
**Exegesis:** *Zhi* means "to dwell." *Qiong* means "limit." Though it undergoes a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, it ever resides at the ultimate mystery, never departing from the wondrous root—moving yet ever still.

And let it flow into the infinite,
**Annotation:** Following change as it proceeds.
**Exegesis:** *Liu* means "to move." Responding to stimuli without fixed direction, it adapts to change with the times, never clinging or holding fast—thus still yet moving.

I would fain ponder it, yet cannot know it;
Gaze upon it, yet cannot see it;
Pursue it, yet cannot reach it.
**Annotation:** Thus it remains open, freely allowing transformations to depart.
**Exegesis:** The supreme joy is the true Dao. Desiring to clarify that the Dao transcends mental discernment, one may deliberate yet fail to know it; the Dao transcends sound and form, so one may gaze yet fail to see it; the Dao transcends physical substance, so one may pursue yet fail to attain it.

Suddenly standing upon the Way of the Four Voids,
**Annotation:** Vast and unbounded, without partiality.
**Exegesis:** *Tangran* describes a state of non-attachment. The *Four Voids* refer to the emptiness of the four directions—the great Dao. The sage, free of intent, shares the same essence as the supreme joy, standing with a mind vast and unbounded, engaging all things without partiality, embracing the ten thousand beings, and harmonizing virtue with the void.

Leaning upon a withered sterculia, he sings.
**Annotation:** No further action remains.
**Exegesis:** Vast and empty, he forgets knowledge and severs thought; thus his form resembles withered wood, his mind like dead ashes—carefree and inactive, he hums and chants.

The eye’s knowledge is exhausted by what it desires to see;
Strength is spent by what it desires to pursue—
I have already acknowledged my inability.
**Annotation:** The knowledge and strength of beings each have their limits.
**Exegesis:** The eye’s capacity for sight has its bounds, hence it is called "exhausted"; the strength expended in pursuit also has its measure, hence it is called "spent." The supreme joy transcends mental, sensory, and material phenomena—it cannot be exhausted by the senses. Thus, I know my limits and no longer pursue it.

Since the mind has its limits, one knows that love has no name.
This recalls the earlier passage on pondering and the like.

When form fills the empty void, it becomes supple and yielding.
You yield and relax, and thus find rest.
**Annotation:** When form fills the empty void, it is without self; without self, one can be supple and yielding. Yielding and following one’s nature, the emotion of fear and dread dissipates.
**Exegesis:** When form fills the void, it equals the vastness of empty space; yielding and following one’s nature, one accords with all circumstances without attachment—this is what is meant by "emptying the body and transcending perception, relinquishing form and abandoning knowledge." Precisely because one yields and follows one’s nature, the emotion of fear and dread comes to rest. This explains the second hearing of the music.

I then play for him the sound without cessation.
**Annotation:** Since the mind has grown weary, yet this is without weariness—this is the ultimate.
**Exegesis:** Upon hearing the supreme joy again, one follows one’s nature in a leisurely manner, and the heart’s fear and dread come to rest. Though superior to the first hearing, it still falls short of the final one—thus the sound without weariness is played. This is to dispel weariness with the absence of weariness, as Guo’s commentary states: "Since weariness has set in, yet this is without weariness—this is the ultimate." This is the third playing.

Harmonizing it with the mandate of nature,
**Annotation:** What the mandate possesses is not contrived—it is all natural.
**Exegesis:** *Tiao* means "to harmonize." All living beings take nature as their mandate. Thus, in playing this *Xianchi* music, one seeks to harmonize the heart-mind of creation and attune to the natural mandate.

Thus, mingling and following, all things arise,
**Annotation:** Mingling without attachment, following as they arise.
**Exegesis:** *Hun* means "to blend"; *sheng* means "to emerge." Like the movement of wind through things, sound arises from the groves.

The music of the groves has no form;
**Annotation:** The supreme joy is simply fitting. Being fitting, it resides within the body—thus it has no separate form.
**Exegesis:** The sound of the groves and the earth’s pipes arises without intent, forming the supreme joy that merely accords with nature—how could it have form?

It spreads and sways without trailing,
**Annotation:** It spreads of itself.
**Exegesis:** It moves the four seasons, disperses the ten thousand things, each attaining its place—not through pulling or dragging.

Dark and obscure, it has no sound.
**Annotation:** This is the so-called supreme joy.
**Exegesis:** The supreme joy is tranquil and remote, transcending sight and hearing—thus it is dark, obscure, and without sound.

Moving without fixed direction,
**Annotation:** Does movement require a direction before it can move?
**Exegesis:** Though the root of the supreme joy is soundless, it responds and moves with the times—truly without fixed direction, still yet moving.

Abiding in profound mystery;
**Annotation:** This is the so-called tranquil extremity.
**Exegesis:** Though it responds to things and adapts to circumstances, undergoing a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, it remains deeply rooted in tranquil extremity, ever dwelling in profound obscurity—moving yet still.

Some call it death, some call it life;
Some call it fruit, some call it blossom;
Flowing, scattering, and shifting, it does not adhere to a constant sound.
**Annotation:** Transforming in accordance with things.
**Exegesis:** Spring brings life, winter brings death; autumn bears fruit, summer brings blossom. Clouds drift, rain scatters, water flows, wind follows—such is the principle of nature, ever renewing its changes. How could the Way of supreme joy adhere to a constant sound?

The world doubts this, and so consults the sage.
**Annotation:** It is clear that the sage responds to the world without initiating.

The **Exegesis** states: *Jī* means to abide. The sage is like the echo in a deep valley, like the reflection in a bright mirror—when confronted, one does not know whence it comes; when cut off, one does not know whither it goes. Things arrive, and the sage responds; responding, the mind remains at ease. How could one premeditate laws and fix the heart to engage with the world? Thus, moving or abiding, scattering or shifting, the sage does not adhere to a constant sound, yet the world’s vulgar people rashly generate doubts.

The sage is one who penetrates the passions and fulfills destiny.
**Annotation:** Thus, all beings with passions and destiny rely upon the sage.
**Exegesis:** What is called the sage bears no other meaning: one who comprehends the passions of things and accords with the natural mandate—this is what is called a sage. The celestial mechanism does not strain, yet the five officials are all complete—this is called celestial joy.
**Annotation:** Joy is sufficient when one forgets joy; completeness does not follow strain.
**Exegesis:** The *celestial mechanism* is the pivot of nature. The *five officials* are the five viscera. Each viscus has its governing office, hence they are called *officials*. The eye sees, the ear hears, the hand grasps, the foot walks—spinning webs, rolling pellets, flying through the air, running on the earth—none of this arises from imitation, but is endowed by the Creator. How could one deliberate before acting? Thus, the offices of the five viscera are inherently complete, and the beauty of celestial joy resides herein. Without speech, the heart rejoices.
**Annotation:** Joy lies in harmony, not in words.
**Exegesis:** Embodying this celestial harmony does not depend on deliberation; thus, the spirit is at ease, and subtlety transcends all description.

Therefore, the many clans composed odes in praise, saying:
*Hearing it, one does not perceive its sound;
Seeing it, one does not perceive its form.
It fills heaven and earth,
Envelops the six directions.
You wish to listen, yet there is no point of contact—
Thus, you remain deluded.*
**Annotation:** This is joy without joy—the ultimate joy.
**Exegesis:** *Kàn* refers to Shennong. Extolling this supreme joy, he composed verses. The great sound is soundless, hence hearing it, one does not perceive it; the great image is formless, hence seeing it, one does not perceive it. The Dao is omnipresent, thus it fills the two poles of heaven and earth; the great is all-encompassing, thus it embraces the six directions. The *six directions* are the six conjunctions. If one attempts to retain the sound and listen, the ear cannot grasp it. Thus, embodying this supreme joy, its principles are profound and subtle; the heart, free of discrimination, resembles ignorance.

Joy begins with fear; fear gives rise to misfortune.
**Annotation:** Startled and trembling in listening, this is misfortune—it is not yet great harmony.
**Exegesis:** Below, the meaning of the three performances and three hearings is further expounded, culminating in the Dao of supreme joy. At first hearing the supreme joy, one does not yet grasp great harmony; the heart is filled with dread and cannot let go—thus, misfortune befalls. I then proceed to stillness; stillness leads to retreat.
**Annotation:** Progress gradually fades.
**Exegesis:** After the second hearing, the mind begins to awaken, and the dreadful heart recedes, its path vanishing. Finally, one is deluded; delusion leads to foolishness; foolishness leads to the Dao, and the Dao can be borne and followed as one.
**Annotation:** Foolishness is taken as ignorance; ignorance is the ultimate state.
**Exegesis:** At the final hearing, the spirit is pure and harmonious, the heart free of discrimination, resembling confusion. Without dread or negligence, it perfectly accords with the true Dao, and thus, carried along without intent, it arrives with things.

Confucius traveled west to Wei. Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin, “What do you make of the Master’s conduct?”
**Exegesis:** Wei was originally the domain of Kunwu and later the fief of Kangshu. Traveling from Lu to Wei is called *traveling west*. *Shi Jin* was the Grand Music Master of Lu, named Jin. *Xī* means *what*. Yan Yuan asks: the Master propagates the Dao of benevolence and righteousness to transform the Marquis of Wei—is this conduct of his truly effective or not?
Shi Jin replied, “Alas! Your Master is doomed to distress.”
**Exegesis:** Confucius was wise and discerning, his talent lamentable. Upholding the sagely teachings of the former kings and adhering to the ancient Dao of Yao and Shun, he repeatedly endured hardship and often faced distress.
Yan Yuan asked, “Why?”**
**Exegesis:** He asks why he is doomed to distress.

Shi Jin said: “When the straw dogs have yet to be displayed, they are stored in bamboo baskets, draped with embroidered cloth, and the invocators fast and purify themselves to present them. When they have already been displayed, passersby trample their heads and backs, and gatherers take them to burn for fuel. Should one then take them again to store in baskets, drape with embroidered cloth, and recline or sleep beneath them, they would not cause nightmares but would surely bring frequent possession by malevolent spirits.

Now your Master has taken the already-displayed straw dogs of the former kings, and his disciples recline and sleep beneath them. Thus he was hewn at the tree in Song, had his traces erased in Wei, and was distressed in Shang and Zhou—was this not his nightmare? Surrounded between Chen and Cai, he went seven days without cooking fire, with death and life as neighbors—was this not his possession by spirits?

Is not water travel best served by boat, and land travel by carriage? To take a boat’s suitability for water and seek to push it on land would leave one unable to advance even a few feet in a lifetime. Are past and present not like water and land? Are Zhou and Lu not like boat and carriage? Now to seek Zhou in Lu is like pushing a boat on land—laborious yet fruitless, and one’s person will surely meet with calamity. He does not know of the transmission without fixed direction, which responds to things without exhaustion.

Have you alone not seen the well-sweep? Pulled, it bows; released, it rises. It is pulled by people, not the one pulling people, and thus bows and rises without offending anyone. If one can empty oneself, the principle is the same. Therefore, the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were not prized for their sameness but for their efficacy in governance.”

The annotation states: it is only required to accord with what is timely and respond to the needs of governance.

The commentary explains: *jīn* means "to esteem." The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors lived in different ages, and their rites, righteousness, majestic demeanor, and regulations did not follow one another. What was esteemed lay in meeting the moment, not in fixed governance, nor in blindly adhering to the present while forcing the past into sameness. Thus, the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors may be likened to millet, pears, oranges, and pomelos—their flavors differ, yet all are pleasing to the mouth.

The commentary further states: millet, pears, oranges, and pomelos vary in sweetness and bitterness, yet when chewed, all are agreeable to the palate. This is like the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, who governed in ages of differing purity and decadence, yet in their administration, all suited the needs of their time. Thus, rites, righteousness, laws, and standards are things that change with the times.

The annotation explains: what one age deems excellent, another may deem detestable. Therefore, they must adapt to the times, and only then will all be fitting.

The commentary continues: the advancement of emperors and kings has no fixed standard. They must respond to the times and change accordingly; they cannot cling rigidly to the past. How can one act in the present as if gluing the tuning pegs of a zither or carving marks on a boat? If one were to dress a cunning macaque in the robes of the Duke of Zhou, it would surely gnaw and tear them, stripping them away until nothing remained. The difference between past and present is like the difference between a macaque and the Duke of Zhou.

The commentary concludes: *xián* means "sufficient." The Duke of Zhou was a sage, like an age of pristine simplicity; the macaque, cunning and sly, represents an age of contention and decadence.

Thus, though ritual robes be resplendent, the cunning macaque finds no beauty in them; though sagely advancement be esteemed, degenerate ages hold it in no reverence. Therefore, when ritual robes are cast aside, the macaque’s heart is at last content; when the sagely is abandoned, the common people find their nature at ease.

So it was with Xishi, who, stricken with heartache, knit her brows in distress—yet the fair women of her village saw her and found her all the more lovely. A homely woman of the same village, observing this, imitated her by clutching her chest and furrowing her brows; but lacking Xishi’s beauty, she only doubled her ugliness. The rich, seeing her, barred their doors and wove no more; the poor, seeing her, took their wives and children and fled.

The commentary explains: Xishi was a beauty of Yue, her visage surpassing all in loveliness. When afflicted with heart pain, she knit her brows in suffering, yet her comeliness only grew, for her bearing was naturally refined. Thus, the people of her village cherished her all the more. The ugly woman of the neighboring village, seeing this, mimicked her without cause, forcing her brows into a grimace that only magnified her plainness. Hence, the rich despised her and would not emerge, while the poor abandoned her and hastened away. To grasp at another’s mannerisms without discernment follows the same principle. To hew at progress as one fells a tree—all are errors born of such mimicry. They know only the beauty of the furrowed brow but not why it was beautiful.

The annotation states: Consider, then, ritual and propriety—when employed in their proper time, they are as Xishi; when clung to past their season, they become as the ugly woman.

The commentary continues: *Suǒyǐ* means "the reason why." The furrowed brow was beautiful because of Xishi’s innate loveliness. The ugly woman, however, admired only the elegance of the grimace, not the grace that arose from Xishi’s natural beauty.

Alas, how straitened was the Master’s plight!

The commentary concludes: These words summarize what follows, bringing the chapter’s meaning to a close. The details of his straitened circumstances are fully set forth within the text.

Confucius, having reached the age of fifty-one without having heard the Dao, journeyed south to Pei to visit Lao Dan.

Lao Dan said: "Have you come? I have heard of you—you are a worthy man of the northern lands. Have you attained the Dao?"

Confucius replied: "I have not."

Lao Dan asked: "Where, then, have you sought it?"

Confucius said: "I sought it in measures and calculations, yet after five years I had not attained it."

Lao Dan asked: "And where else have you sought it?"

Confucius said: "I sought it in the principles of yin and yang, yet after twelve years I had not attained it."

Lao Dan said: "Indeed. If the Dao could be offered, none would fail to offer it to their lord; if it could be presented, none would fail to present it to their kin; if it could be told to others, none would fail to tell it to their brothers; if it could be given to others, none would fail to give it to their children and grandchildren. Yet it cannot—there is no other reason: when the center lacks a master, it does not abide; when the exterior lacks rectitude, it does not proceed. That which issues from within cannot be received from without—thus the sage does not emerge. That which enters from without finds no master within—thus the sage does not conceal it.

Names are public instruments; they cannot be taken in excess. Virtue and righteousness are the thatched huts of the former kings—suitable for a single night’s stay but not for long dwelling. To observe them too closely is to invite many reproaches.

The perfected men of old borrowed the Way of virtue and lodged in righteousness, roaming the wastes of carefree wandering. They ate from fields of rough simplicity and stood in gardens of no-gain. For they moved without harming stillness and responded without departing from truth, ever at ease in the realm of self-possession, wandering in the realm of non-action."

"Simplicity means brevity. *Dai* means bestowal. Knowing when to stop and when one has enough, one eats from fields of rough simplicity; not depleting one’s own resources, one stands in gardens of no-giving. As for fields and gardens, they make clear the grounds of the sage’s nurturance of life.

Carefree wandering is non-action—
*For action is not the Way of virtue and righteousness.*
Rough simplicity is ease of nurturance—
*For preserving its simplicity makes it easy to nurture.*

*Only when the burdens of carefree wandering are exhausted can one attain non-action and tranquility. Rough simplicity means provisional and unadorned, content with what is sufficient—thus it is easy to nurture. No-giving means no expenditure—*
*For no-giving means not depleting oneself for the sake of others.*
*Thus there is nothing to be given out.*

These three phrases reiterate the preceding meaning. The ancients called this ‘roaming in the gathering of the real.’
*To roam and follow what is so—this is the gathering of the real.*
When one gathers the real, one’s countenance is not false.

Those who take wealth as right cannot relinquish emolument;
those who take prominence as right cannot relinquish fame;"

Those who cling to power cannot yield authority to others.
*For none in the world are free from the entanglements of their own attachments, yet each perishes for the sake of what they deem right. Those who perish for what they deem right do not stand in the garden of no-giving.*

Those who esteem wealth and revere profit—how can they relinquish emolument to others?
Those who esteem prominence and disdain obscurity, who cling to honor and rank—how can they yield fame to others?
Those who cherish power and authority, who pride themselves before others—how can they yield control to others?
*Control means authority.*
Only those who disdain the filth of worldly dust, who spurn the restlessness of fame and profit, can cast them aside as if forgotten.

To grasp it is to tremble;
to relinquish it is to grieve.
*To grieve at relinquishing it is to tremble at grasping it.*
To cling to authority is to fear its loss and so quake;
to abandon power is to mourn its absence and so sorrow.
Yet those who remain blind to all this, recklessly pursuing what they cannot cease—these are the people Heaven executes.
*For they know only advance and not retreat, thus forfeiting their nature and life—this is why they are executed.*
Such are the wealthy and power-loving, whose minds are dull and benighted, who remain mired in fame and profit, utterly lacking discernment. How could they perceive the profound Dao and still their minds, quiet their wisdom? Though no earthly punishment has befallen them, their nature is already exhausted—thus they are the people of Heaven’s execution.

Enmity and gratitude, taking and giving, admonition and instruction, life and death—these eight are the instruments of governance.
*Enmity demands retribution; gratitude requires repayment. What is rightfully one’s own is taken; what is beyond one’s due is given. Ministers admonish their rulers; fathers instruct their children. Life follows the verdant spring; death and punishment accord with the stark autumn. These eight are the instruments of governance, indispensable in their use.*
Only those who follow great change without obstruction can wield them. Thus it is said: *To govern is to rectify.*
Those whose hearts dissent—Heaven’s gate remains barred to them.
*To cling to the old without change is to lose rectitude.*

*To follow is to comply. Obstruction means blockage.*
Only by complying with the great principle, adapting to change, and penetrating the nature of things without hindrance can one employ these eight instruments of governance. Rectitude in affairs aligns with the principle of rectitude—thus it is said: *To rectify is to rectify.* Those whose hearts cannot do so find the gate of Heaven’s mechanism shut and unopened.
*Heaven’s gate is the heart.*

Confucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness.
Lao Dan said: *"When chaff gets in the eye, the four directions seem to shift; when mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, one cannot sleep all night.*
*Though external things may be small, their harm to one’s nature is great.*
Confucius, bound by the path of the sage, spoke of benevolence and righteousness when he opened his mouth. When chaff irritates the eye, vision blurs and cannot distinguish east from west; when mosquitoes and gnats sting the skin, the pain keeps one awake through the night. Thus, though external things may be minor, their harm is vast. How much greater, then, is the harm when benevolence is not the natural principle, when righteousness does not follow one’s nature—when one abandons oneself to imitate others, losing one’s original nature? The harm is far beyond mere eye irritation or skin bites.
*To bite is to gnaw.*
Benevolence and righteousness, so bewildering, confound the heart—no disorder is greater.
*To exalt them is to burden one’s nature—thus they cause disorder.*
Benevolence and righteousness are more poisonous than mosquitoes and gnats, confounding the heart and stirring turmoil. No disturbance of one’s nature is greater than this.
*One version also writes ‘confound’ here.*

You would have the world not lose its simplicity.
*When one’s nature is whole, benevolence and righteousness become manifest.*
You, too, should move with the wind and act, embracing virtue and standing firm.
*To move with the wind is to follow it; to stand with virtue is to hold fast to it—this is the Way of easy maintenance and practice.*
*To embrace means to follow. To hold fast is to grasp.*
You wish to prevent the people from losing their unadorned nature—nothing does so more than abandoning benevolence and discarding righteousness, thus returning to the ultimate mystery. Confucius, too, should follow the teachings of non-action, responding to circumstances as they arise, embracing the supreme virtue of emptiness, and establishing the unfathomable spiritual realm.
*One version writes ‘embrace’ as ‘turn back and forth.’ To embrace means to rely upon.*

Why then do you exert yourself so strenuously, like one beating a drum in search of a lost child?
*To brandish benevolence and righteousness in pursuit of the realm of Dao and virtue is like striking a drum to find a runaway—there is no way to succeed.*
*To beat is to strike. Strenuously means with great effort.*
To brandish benevolence and righteousness in pursuit of the realm of Dao and virtue—how is this different from beating a great drum to find a lost child? The louder the drum, the farther the child flees; the more benevolence and righteousness are proclaimed, the more the Dao and virtue recede.

The swan does not bathe daily to remain white; the crow does not blacken itself daily to stay black.
*Their natures are each already sufficient.*
The simplicity of black and white is not enough to distinguish them;
*Both are natural—there is no need to favor one over the other.*
*To bathe is to wash. To blacken is to dye black.*
The whiteness of the swan and the blackness of the crow are endowed by nature—why must they bathe or dye themselves daily to remain so? The same principle applies to the nature of things. Yet the simplicity of black and white, each sufficient in its own measure, finds its place as it is—thus they are not enough to debate superiority.
*Another interpretation: To distinguish means to change. Black and white are fixed in their natures—one cannot change white to black.*
The spectacle of fame and reputation is not enough to broaden one’s reach.
*Those who are truly sufficient forget fame and reputation; only by forgetting them can one become vast.*
To cultivate fame and establish reputation, drawing the gaze of others—this is narrow and petty, hardly something to boast of.

Only by relinquishing fame and reputation can one be called great.

When the spring dries up, fish find themselves stranded on dry land, moistening one another with dampness, wetting one another with foam—
*Such are the reputations of benevolence and righteousness, all born of insufficiency.*
Far better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes.
*This is to forget benevolence while embodying it.*
*This sums up the preceding passage, exposing the flaws of benevolence and righteousness.*

When the fountainhead runs dry, fish pass foam to moisten one another;
when simplicity scatters and purity disperses, they practice benevolence and righteousness to aid others.
Yet when rivers and lakes stretch vast, each suffices in itself, and so they forget one another;
when the Dao and virtue run deep and mysterious, one attains one’s nature and thus abides in emptiness and tranquility.
Since rivers and lakes may be likened to the Dao and virtue, and moistening foam to benevolence and righteousness, measured by this standard, they are not to be spoken of in the same breath.

Confucius, having met with Lao Dan, remained silent for three days.
*Laozi was a great sage beyond the world, his transformations unfathomable—thus there was nothing to discuss.*
His disciples asked: "Master, when you met with Lao Dan, what counsel did you seek?"
*Not naming the disciple, simply calling him "disciple," this must have been one of those who had entered the hall, raising this doubt together.*
Having met with Laozi, you should have received instruction—what did you hear that left you silent for three days?

Confucius said: "Only now have I truly seen the dragon.
The dragon coalesces into form, scatters into pattern—
*This refers to Lao Dan’s ability to transform.*
*The dragon’s virtue lies in its ceaseless transformation.*
By analogy, the perfected person appears and disappears without fixed abode: in its fundamental unity, it coalesces into a wondrous body, dark and profound; in its unfolding, it scatters into radiant patterns.
It rides the clouds and nourishes itself through yin and yang—
*This speaks of its boundless mastery, naturally sufficient in itself.*
*The perfected person rides the clouds without intention, following yin and yang to nurture all things.*
My mouth fell open and could not close—how could I presume to counsel Lao Dan?"
*My mind trembled, unsettled; my mouth gaped and would not shut—how could I find room to hear words of instruction?*

Zigong said: "Then does such a person truly exist—one who dwells like a corpse yet appears like a dragon, thunders like a storm yet remains as silent as the abyss, whose movements stir like heaven and earth?"
*Such a person, in stillness, abides as calmly as a corpse; in action, appears as wondrously as a dragon. In speech, resounds like thunder; in silence, mirrors the profound and soundless. Thus, when roused to action, they move like the two forces that generate all things.*
Whether appearing or withdrawing, speaking or silent—is there truly a difference between these states, that one should treat them as distinct?
Yet the perfected person indeed possesses the power to appear and withdraw, speak and remain silent without words. Thus, when Confucius beheld him, his mouth could not close.
"May I too witness such a one?"
And so he spoke of Confucius’ encounter with Lao Dan.

Child Gong was the name of Zigong. Desiring to behold the dragon-like virtue and countenance of the perfected person, he went forth to meet Lao Dan, invoking the teachings of Confucius. Lao Dan, just then, was reclining in his hall when he responded, softly saying: "My years have advanced and passed away—what counsel could you offer me?"

*Reclining* here signifies standing tall. *Advanced* means time. Laozi, self-possessed and at ease, stood erect in his hall, aloof and unhurried. Yet when moved by others, he would respond, uttering words with subtle depth: "My years have declined—could you truly instruct me?"

Zigong said: "The governance of the Three Kings and Five Emperors differed in method, yet their fame and renown were one. Why then does the Master alone deem them not sages? How can this be?"

The purity of customs gradually waned, their steps diverged, some employed labor, others force, some followed the natural order, others defied it—thus their methods differed. Yet their illustrious reputations remained uniformly linked. Why then does the Master reject the Three Kings as sages? What is the meaning behind this? Might I hear it?

Lao Dan said: "Young one, come closer. Why do you say their methods differed?"

Zigong advanced and replied: "Yao yielded to Shun, Shun received from Yu. Yu governed through labor, Tang through force. King Wen submitted to Zhou without daring to oppose, while King Wu opposed Zhou without consenting to submit. Thus, I say their methods differed."

Yao and Shun were among the Five Emperors; from Xia Yu onward, they became the Three Kings. Yao ceded to Shun, Shun to Yu. Yu tamed the floods through labor, Tang overthrew Jie through force. King Wen was imprisoned at Youli yet submitted to Shang Xin, while King Wu crossed the Meng Ford to defy Yin Zhou. Their differing approaches may be briefly described thus.

Lao Dan said: "Young one, come closer. I shall speak to you of the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors."

The Three Sovereigns were Fu Xi, Shen Nong, and the Yellow Emperor. The Five Emperors were Shaohao, Zhuanxu, Gaoxin, Tang Yao, and Yu Shun. Their governance of the world is described below.

The Yellow Emperor’s governance made the people’s hearts one. When their parents died, they did not weep, yet none among the people condemned this.

*If condemned, then forced weeping would follow.*

The Three Sovereigns practiced the Dao, and the people’s hearts were pure and unified. They did not exclusively cherish their own kin nor raise only their own children. Thus, when parents died, they did not weep, and the world did not condemn them. If condemned, forced weeping would have been widespread.

Yao’s governance made the people’s hearts affectionate. When they mourned their kin with graded mourning rites, none among the people condemned this.

*Graded* refers to distinctions in mourning. It means kinship had degrees of closeness and distance.

The Five Emperors practiced virtue, though not to the extent of the Three Sovereigns. They fostered mutual affection among fathers, sons, and brothers, establishing graded mourning rites to distinguish near and distant kin. This aligned with human sentiment and was not condemned.

Shun’s governance made the people’s hearts competitive. Pregnant women gave birth after ten months, and their children could speak at five months.

*This was due to rapid instruction.*

Shun was the last of the Five Emperors, and customs gradually grew shallow. Simplicity dissolved, and the people’s hearts became restless and competitive. Thus, pregnant women gave birth after ten months, and their children could speak at five. In ancient times, pregnancy lasted fourteen months, and children only began speaking at two years. With the erosion of purity, this departed from ancient ways.

Before they could even laugh as infants, they began to distinguish others.

*Distinguish* means to differentiate people. Before they could laugh, they were already choosing whom to favor, showing how swiftly competition and instruction took hold.

Thus, people first began to die prematurely.

*Unable to harmonize self and other, their hearts competed in partiality, so they did not live out their natural years.*

Once distinctions grew pronounced, they no longer lived out their natural years. Premature death began in the time of Yu Shun.

Yu’s governance made the people’s hearts change. People had intentions, and weapons had their proper use.

*This implies that if weapons had their proper use, then the world already had those who did not follow the proper way.*

As the Dao receded, artifice and falsity flourished daily. The foolish people became prone to turmoil and change. They abandoned the practice of non-action and embraced the heart of action, rewarding good and punishing evil as their guiding principle. Yet Yu, moved by compassion, still wept for those condemned. Where blades fell, he sought the mandate of heaven.

Killing bandits was not killing.

*Bandits deserved death; killing them was proper, thus it was not truly killing.*

Bandits were guilty and rightfully executed. Aligning with the autumnal principle, though it was killing, it was not killing. This was the proper use of weapons.

People became their own kind, and thus the world was so.

*Unable to unify the myriad things, each person distinguished themselves. Thus, people became their own kind.*

Unable to bring great harmony to all things, each person separated themselves. This was the consequence of a hundred generations’ flow converging in the present age’s changes. The corruption reached this point not because of Yu. Thus, it is said: "the world was so." The teachings of sagely wisdom did not disrupt the world, yet the world inevitably fell into this disorder.

As customs grew shallow, distinctions deepened daily. Each person became their own kind, unable to unify the myriad things. This was the result of sagely wisdom’s teachings, not Yu’s fault. Thus, it is said: "the world was so."

Therefore, the world was greatly alarmed, and the Confucians and Mohists all arose.

*This was the corruption of a hundred generations.*

This summarizes the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, which startled the people of the world. The Confucians exalted Yao and Shun to justify their errors, while the Mohists followed Yu’s path and claimed their own rightness. Thereafter, the hundred schools competed, the nine streams vied—later ages’ corruptions arose from this.

The inception of their ways had order, yet now it has come to this—women as wives,

Today, those who take women as wives and invert the proper hierarchy do not stem from the founder’s lack of principle, but rather from the corruption of the highest principle, which has led to this state.

Order means principle. In Zhuangzi’s time, the six states vied for dominance, and wanton customs flourished. Taking women as wives, they defied ritual and virtue—nothing was more perverse than this. Thus we know: when sagely teachings first arose, they possessed order and principle, but in their decline, all fell into this same corruption.

What more can be said?

Corruption arises from principle, so there is nothing left to say.

From principle, teachings were born, yet they have come to this. With customs shallow and the age degenerate, what words could suffice?

Discourse on Rectitude #45: Indignation gives rise to grievance and deceit.

I tell you: the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, though called "governance," brought no greater disorder.

This must be due to corruption.

The governance of the Three Sovereigns truly began with non-action. Yet the doctrine of non-action itself arose from corruption, so that in later ages, no disorder was greater. The forms of this corruption and chaos are detailed below.

The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns, above, contradicted the brightness of the sun and moon; below, it estranged the essence of mountains and rivers; and in between, it undermined the bestowal of the four seasons.

Contradiction means opposition. Estrangement means separation. Undermined means ruined or destroyed. Bestowal means grace. Wielding the wisdom of non-action to establish governance, later ages clung to its paths, and thus corruption took hold. This caused the stars and constellations to rebel, comets to appear, and the sun and moon to dim; mountains and rivers grew estranged, peaks and streams collapsed and dried up.

The ruin of the four seasons caused cold and heat to fall into disorder. Their wisdom was as venomous as the sting of a mantis or the tail of a scorpion, and even the smallest creatures could not preserve the integrity of their natures—yet they still considered themselves sages. Was this not shameful? How utterly shameless!

The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns harmed the common people, its toxicity exceeding even that of venomous tails. Thus, even the tiniest insects and beasts were disturbed, let alone the black-haired masses—how could they find peace? To call this sagacity defies reason. The harm was so great that it should have been a source of deep shame.

Zigong stood unsettled, shifting uneasily. (Originally, Zigong had believed Laozi surpassed the Three Kings, so he sought to equate the Three Kings with the Five Emperors. Now, seeing Laozi extend his critique to the Five Emperors and even the Three Sovereigns, he lost the basis of his argument.)

Zigong had hoped to defend the Three Kings by aligning them with the Five Emperors. But upon witnessing Laozi’s lofty discourse—dismissing the Five Emperors and denouncing the Three Sovereigns—his heart trembled with shock, his arguments faltered, and though his form remained standing, his spirit was unsettled.

Confucius said to Lao Dan: "I have studied the *Six Classics*—*The Odes*, *The Documents*, *The Rites*, *The Music*, *The Changes*, and *The Spring and Autumn Annals*—for a long time, believing I had mastered their essence. Yet when I discoursed on the Way of the former kings and clarified the governance of Zhou and Shao before seventy-two rulers, not a single one adopted my counsel. How difficult it is to persuade others! How hard it is to make the Dao clear!"

Laozi replied: "Fortunate indeed that you have not encountered a ruler of a well-ordered age. The *Six Classics* are but the worn traces of the former kings—how could they be the means by which governance is achieved? (What truly advances governance is the authentic nature of things. When one follows the true nature of things, the *Six Classics* naturally emerge. What you speak of is merely the trace. The trace is what the shoe leaves behind, but is the trace itself the shoe?) In today’s world, people treat spontaneity as the shoe and the *Six Classics* as the trace.

Consider the white egrets: they gaze at one another, their pupils unmoving, yet the wind carries their transformation. Or the insects: the male chirps on the upwind, the female responds from downwind, and the wind conveys their transformation. (Egrets mate by gazing with their pupils. Insects respond to each other’s calls, conceiving without physical union—hence ‘transformation by wind.’) Creatures of the same kind naturally pair as male and female, thus transforming by wind. (Among those of the same kind, each has its own way of mutual resonance. The modes of resonance are boundless; if they belong to the same kind, transformation is effortless. Thus, even from afar, they may transform by wind.)

Nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, and the Dao cannot be obstructed. (Thus, the perfected person follows and flows with them.) If one attains the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be done. (Even transformations without fixed form are all possible.) If one loses it, there is nothing that can be done. (Nowhere is it possible.)

Three months later, Confucius returned and said: "I have grasped it! Crows and magpies mate in their nests, fish fertilize with foam, and the slender-waisted wasp transforms. (These are the natural dispositions of things.) (Magpies nest together, uniting yin and yang; fish in water fertilize with foam; wasps take silkworm grubs and, through incantation, make them their own offspring. Thus, the natures of things differ, each endowed by the great Dao—each has its own natural disposition.) A younger brother is born, and the elder brother weeps. (Human nature favors the young over the elder, hence the weeping.) (The elder brother loses affection, for people cherish the young and pity the small—thus he weeps. This shows that traces cannot be clung to; one must simply follow them. When self and others are unburdened, human nature naturally favors the young over the elder, hence the weeping.)

For too long, I have not been one who transforms with others as a person. If I do not transform with others as a person, how can I transform others? (One who transforms with others as a person follows their spontaneous transformation. To expound the *Six Classics* in persuasion is but a distant trace.)"

Laozi said: "Good. You have grasped it."

The Tang dynasty Master of the Western Flower, Cheng Xuanying’s *Subcommentary* on the *Outer Chapters*, "Carving Intentions" (Chapter Fifteen)

Carving intentions and esteeming conduct, departing from the world and differing from the common, discoursing loftily and resenting slander—this is but exhaustion. Such are the scholars of mountains and valleys, not the people of the world, the likes of those who wither in emaciation or plunge into the abyss.

**[Subcommentary]** *Carving* means *paring*; *intent* means *aspiration*. *Exhaustion* means *extremity*. These partial and stagnant persons, unable to accord with the Dao, pare and discipline body and mind, esteeming their conduct as lofty. They depart from and differ from the common world, standing aloof and peerless. They discourse on the winds of the Five Emperors and expound the teachings of the Three Sovereigns. They resent the talented who meet no opportunity and slander the wayless who wallow in excess. They are but a few in the groves of aspiration, paring and advancing amid the cliffs and crags. These are the recluses of mountains and valleys, not the people who revile the times. Those who wither in emaciation are of the kind of Bao Jiao and Jie Zitui; those who plunge into the abyss are of the kind of Shen Di and Bian Sui. They are but one-sided scholars—how could they speak of the ultimate Dao? *Already* means *to cease*. Their defense ceases here.

Discoursing on benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust; reverence, frugality, deference, and yielding—this is but cultivation. Such are the scholars of a well-ordered age, the people who instruct and admonish, those who delight in wandering and dwelling in study.

**[Subcommentary]** When they give voice to their breath, their words extend to benevolence and righteousness. They take these as the foundation of self-cultivation. These are the scholars of a well-ordered age, the people who instruct and transform others. Such were Zixia in the Western River and Confucius dwelling by the Si and the Wei—some discoursing on the conduct of the Dao, others dwelling in peace to expound and explain. These are what scholars delight in; they are not what Daoists take as primary.

Discoursing on great achievements, establishing great renown, observing the rites of ruler and minister, rectifying high and low—this is but governance. Such are the scholars of the court, the people who honor the ruler and strengthen the state, those who delight in achieving merit and annexing others.

**[Subcommentary]** They establish achievements that span the world and found great renown that endures through the ages. They perfect the grand rites of ruler and minister and rectify the great principles of ruling all under Heaven. They pacify the altars of soil and grain and brighten the constant Dao. Thus they honor the ruler and bring distant lands into submission, strengthen the homeland and annex enemy states. Are these not the scholars of the court, the ministers of the hall and temple? Such were Gaoyao, Yi Yin, and Lü Wang.

Dwelling in marshes and wetlands, abiding in seclusion and openness, angling for fish and living in quietude—this is but nonaction. Such are the scholars of rivers and seas, the people who withdraw from the world, those who delight in leisure and ease.

**[Subcommentary]** They dwell hidden in mountains and marshes, roam freely in wetlands and open lands. They live in quietude and occupy themselves with angling, withdrawing from the world and abiding in nonaction. The Son of Heaven cannot make them his ministers; the feudal lords cannot make them their friends. These are the people of leisure and ease, such as Chaofu, Xu You, and Gongyue Xiu.

Pursing the lips and exhaling, expelling the old and drawing in the new, imitating the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching—this is but longevity. Such are the practitioners of guiding and pulling, the people who nurture the body, those who delight in the long-lived like Peng Zu.

**[Annotation]** These several kinds of people, though their delights differ, indulge their delights and each follows his own way—this too is a means of attaining freedom. Yet this is each attaining his own; how could it be without anything not established? If one would make the myriad things each attain its portion without self-loss, then one must entrust it to non-attachment to action.

**[Subcommentary]** They purse their lips and exhale the old, follow the warmth and inhale the new. Like the bear climbing a tree and hanging itself, like the bird flying in the sky and stretching its legs—these all guide and pull the spirit and qi to nurture the body and soul. This is the way of prolonging life, the defense of preserving form. Thus Peng Zu lived eight hundred years, and White Stone lived three thousand—these are the long-lived. The several kinds of people mentioned earlier, though their aspirations differ, each stagnates in one direction and has not attained universal excellence. Only from "not carving intentions" onward does one accord with the wondrous subtlety of the mysterious.

As for not carving intentions yet being lofty, having no benevolence or righteousness yet being cultivated, having no achievements or renown yet governing, having no rivers or seas yet being secluded, not guiding and pulling yet being long-lived—

**[Annotation]** This is what is called *naturalness*. There is nothing not forgotten, and nothing not possessed.

**[Annotation]** Because one forgets, one is able to possess. If one possessed it, one could not save it from being forgotten. Thus, what possesses is not possessed by possessing but is possessed by forgetting.

**[Subcommentary]** The scholar who is spiritually penetrating and harmonizes with change, the person who darkly accords with the truth—without carving intentions, their Dao is all the loftier; without benevolence or righteousness, they naturally cultivate themselves; forgetting achievements and renown, the world is greatly governed; departing from rivers and seas, they are serene and at ease; not guiding and pulling, their lifespan is boundless. Thus they can forget all things along with the self, and the myriad things return to them, so there is nothing not possessed. This is possessing by forgetting, not possessing by possessing.

The tranquil and boundless—all excellences follow from it.

**[Annotation]** If one disciplines oneself to act, one cannot be boundless, and all evils arise.

**[Subcommentary]** The mind does not stagnate in one direction but darkly accords with the Five Phases. Thus, being tranquil and empty, their Dao is inexhaustible, and all virtues follow from them. This is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.

**[Annotation]** That which does not act for the myriad things yet the myriad things spontaneously arise is Heaven and Earth. That which does not act for the hundred conducts yet the hundred conducts spontaneously form is the sage.

**[Subcommentary]** Heaven and Earth have no mind to nurture yet the myriad things are born; the sage has no mind to transform yet the hundred conducts are formed. Thus Heaven and Earth take non-production as production to be the Dao; the sage takes non-action as action to perfect virtue. Thus the *Laozi* says, "Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; the sage is not benevolent." Therefore it is said: "Serenity, stillness, emptiness, nonbeing, nonaction—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the substance of the Dao and virtue."

**[Annotation]** If it were not for stillness, nonaction, and emptiness, then one would endanger this equilibrium and lose this substance.

---

**[Subcommentary]** Serenity and joy, stillness and solitude—these are the mind of concentration and clarity. Emptiness, nonbeing, and nonaction—these are the wisdom of quiescent function. Heaven and Earth take this method as the source of equilibrium; the Dao and virtue take this method as the root of substantial reality. Thus it is said: When the sage rests in perfect ease, then equilibrium and simplicity are attained.

**[Annotation]** Resting in serenity, expansiveness, stillness, and solitude, abiding in emptiness, nonbeing, and nonaction—though traversing the changes of perilous obstacles, one remains ever level and free from difficulty.

**[Subcommentary]** Resting the mind in the realm of serenity and joy, settling wisdom in the state of emptiness and nonbeing—thus one treads through hardship with ease, crosses danger with equanimity. Equilibrium and simplicity yield serenity and expansiveness.

**[Annotation]** Difficulty arises from action; action likewise arises from the cessation of difficulty. Thus equilibrium, simplicity, serenity, and expansiveness mutually complete one another.

**[Subcommentary]** Not only does resting the mind in serenity and expansiveness bring equilibrium and simplicity—equilibrium and simplicity in turn yield serenity and expansiveness. Thus we know that equilibrium, simplicity, serenity, and expansiveness mutually complete one another. With equilibrium and serenity, cares and troubles cannot enter; perverse qi cannot assail.

**[Annotation]** Merging utterly with the correct principle, they proceed as one.

**[Subcommentary]** The mind being serene and expansive, the borders being level and simple—though mind and circumstances are conjoined, all is of a piece in nonaction. Thus deep cares and encumbrances cannot enter the numinous terrace; wayward and demonic influences cannot assail the storehouses of the viscera. "Assail" means to enter, the phrasing varied for emphasis. Thus one’s power is whole and the spirit unharmed.

**[Annotation]** Those who are neither level nor at ease—do they merely harm their forms? Their spirit and power are both lost within.

**[Subcommentary]** Those who are serene and free from action—do they merely leave the outer form unharmed? Their inner power is also complete and perfect. The vessel of the body being at peace, the spirit suffers no loss. Thus it is said: The sage’s life moves as the heavens move;

**[Annotation]** Moving and acting by natural spontaneity.

**[Subcommentary]** The sage’s death transforms as things transform;

**[Annotation]** Shedding the body like a cicada’s husk, with nothing to bind him.

**[Subcommentary]** The sage embodies the nonduality of activity and rest, comprehends the unity of coming and going. Thus in life he moves like the heavenly Dao; in death he changes like the myriad things—submitting to the smelting and molding of the furnace, with not the slightest obstruction in his breast. In stillness, he shares the power of yin; in movement, he shares the current of yang.

**[Annotation]** In movement and stillness, he has no mind of his own but entrusts himself to yin and yang.

**[Subcommentary]** Concentrating the spirit in still contemplation, he shares the abundant power of Great Yin; responding to stimuli in movement, he shares the waves of yang’s darkness. In movement and stillness he follows the seasons, for he is without mind. He does not act as the harbinger of fortune, nor as the origin of misfortune. He responds only after being moved;

**[Annotation]** He does not initiate.

**[Subcommentary]** Goodness acts as the harbinger of fortune, evil as the origin of misfortune—having relinquished both good and evil, he likewise forgets both fortune and misfortune. Responding only after being moved, how could he act as harbinger or origin? He moves only when pressed;

**[Annotation]** He acts only when the occasion arrives.

**[Subcommentary]** "Pressed" means arrival or urgency. "Moves" means responds. Harmonious yet not initiating, he responds to the moment. He rises only when he cannot but do so.

**[Annotation]** Rising in accord with principle, he cannot but act.

**[Subcommentary]** "Cannot but" means cessation. When the stimulus of the moment arrives, when the matter cannot be stopped, then he rises to respond—not by premeditation. Abandoning knowledge and artifice, he follows the principle of Heaven.

**[Annotation]** Heaven’s principle is natural; knowledge and artifice have no place in its midst.

**[Subcommentary]** "Follows" means to accord. Within, he abandons the mind of knowledge; without, he forgets affairs and artifice—like the undifferentiated state of primordial chaos, he accords with the wondrous principle of spontaneity. Thus he suffers no heavenly disasters,

**[Annotation]** Disasters arise from opposing Heaven.

**[Subcommentary]** Accord with Heaven, and there are no disasters.

No encumbrances from things,

**[Annotation]** Encumbrances arise from opposing things.

**[Subcommentary]** Accord with things, and there are no encumbrances.

No blame from others,

**[Annotation]** Those who are one with others are affirmed by the multitude.

**[Subcommentary]** One with others, and there is no blame.

No reproach from spirits.

**[Annotation]** One with self-attainment, and there is no reproach.

**[Subcommentary]** His life is like floating; his death is like rest.

**[Annotation]** Drifting without attachment.

**[Subcommentary]** The sage moves and is still without mind, death and life as one continuum. Thus in life he seems like a floating bubble briefly arisen, transformed in an instant; in death he is like weariness finding rest, with no lingering attachments. He does not ponder or scheme,

**[Annotation]** He entrusts himself to Heaven’s principle.

**[Subcommentary]** His mind like dead ashes, utterly free from anxious thought.

Nor plan in advance,

**[Annotation]** He responds when principle arrives.

**[Subcommentary]** Like a mirror hung high in the hall, it reflects whatever comes before it—never plotting or measuring in advance to await the moment. Radiant yet not dazzling,

**[Annotation]** Employing the world’s own radiance, not his own.

**[Subcommentary]** The light of his wisdom shines brighter than sun and moon, yet he conceals its brilliance and obscures its traces—thus he does not dazzle others. Trustworthy yet not bound by expectation,

**[Annotation]** Employing the world’s own trustworthiness, not his own.

**[Subcommentary]** Responding to the moment, he moves like a shadow following form—trustworthy as the four seasons, never deviating in the slightest. He responds only when the moment arrives, not by prior expectation. In sleep, he does not dream; in waking, he has no cares.

**[Subcommentary]** United with the real, thus he is quiescent and dreamless; all encumbrances exhausted, thus he is ever at ease and free from care. His spirit is pure and unalloyed,

**[Annotation]** Without a single desire.

**[Subcommentary]** "Pure and unalloyed" means without admixture. Having no dreams and no cares, united with the real and in accord with the Dao, thus his mind and spirit are pure and unalloyed, without the slightest impurity. His spirit does not weary.

**[Annotation]** Weariness arises from desire.

**[Subcommentary]** Serene and free from action, his mind and spirit at leisure—thus his essence and spirit ever respond without weariness. Emptiness and serenity—thus he accords with Heaven’s power.

**[Annotation]** Thus he joins with Heaven and Earth in their serenity and expansiveness.

The Subcommentary extols this state of emptiness and nonbeing, uniting its power with that of Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said: sorrow and joy are perversions of virtue.

**[Subcommentary]** When the heart resists, there is sorrow; when it accords, there is joy. Failing to comprehend this resistance and compliance, one falls into the delusion of virtue.

Joy and anger are transgressions against the Dao.

**[Subcommentary]** When the heart is gratified, there is joy; when it is thwarted, there is anger. To remain attached to joy and anger is to commit an offense against the Dao.

Likes and dislikes are lapses in virtue.

**[Subcommentary]** To mistake the absence of liking for liking, or the absence of disliking for disliking—such deluded thoughts are the failings of virtue.

Thus, a heart free from sorrow and joy is the perfection of virtue.

**[Annotation]** In perfect ease and constancy, emotions find no foothold.

**[Subcommentary]** Without joy or anger, without sorrow or delight, serene and empty—such is the person of utmost virtue.

Unchanging unity is the perfection of stillness.

**[Annotation]** Stillness and unity cannot be altered.

**[Subcommentary]** Embracing the mysterious Dao of true unity, merging with the clamor of the world without change—none but the perfectly still can achieve this.

Encountering no resistance is the perfection of emptiness.

**[Annotation]** The heart, vast and utterly exhausted, knows no trace of opposition.

**[Subcommentary]** *Jiàn* means opposition. To move through life without resistance or conflict—none but the utterly empty can attain this.

Not engaging with things is the perfection of blandness.

**[Annotation]** Things come of themselves; the utterly bland harbor no inclination to engage.

**[Subcommentary]** Abiding in purity and loftiness, not entangled with things, needing nothing, attaining the utmost serenity.

Encountering no opposition is the perfection of purity.

**[Annotation]** If tainted by turbid desires, there will be resistance.

**[Subcommentary]** Illuminating wisdom, utterly pure and unadulterated, thus able to harmonize with the myriad things, in great accord with all beings. Whether yielding or resisting, the principle remains the same. Here, the two virtues of emptiness and purity are expounded, hence the repetition.

Thus it is said: when the body labors without rest, it becomes exhausted; when the essence is employed without cease, it grows weary; weariness leads to depletion.

**[Annotation]** All things have their proper measure; it must not be lost.

**[Subcommentary]** The body and spirit are endowed with limits, yet their use knows no bounds—this leads inevitably to death. Thus, to labor the body beyond its capacity without rest brings about exhaustion. When the spirit pursues things without cessation, it must become weary; weariness leads to the withering and depletion of essence.

The nature of water is such that when unadulterated, it is clear; when undisturbed, it is level. If obstructed and left unstirred, it cannot remain clear—this is the image of Heaven’s power.

**[Annotation]** To image Heaven’s power is to be without intent yet in accord with all things.

**[Subcommentary]** *Xiàng* means to emulate. Water’s nature is clarity and levelness, reflecting all things. If it is mixed or obstructed, it strays from its constant nature, unable to flow freely or reflect clearly. Only when undisturbed and unobstructed can it remain clear and level, illuminating impartially, serving as the standard for all things—this is the image of Heaven’s power. By analogy, the sage’s heart is empty and pure, reflecting without partiality, emulating nature, and uniting its power with the mysterious Heaven. Thus, the *Laozi* says, "The highest good is like water."

Thus it is said: pure and unadulterated,

**[Annotation]** Without anything that is not perfectly fitting.

**[Subcommentary]** Though mingling with the world’s dust, the spirit remains concentrated and profound. This reiterates the earlier "his spirit is pure and unalloyed."

Still and unified, without change,

**[Annotation]** Always abiding in what is fitting.

**[Subcommentary]** Though myriad transformations unfold, the heart remains ever still and unified. This reaffirms "unchanging unity."

Bland and without action,

**[Annotation]** Simply in accord with all things.

**[Subcommentary]** Though moving amid the world’s waves, nothing hinders its emptiness and blandness; though engaging with things, it does not abandon nonaction. This explains the earlier "perfection of blandness."

Moving in accordance with Heaven’s course,

**[Annotation]** To move in pursuit of desire is human conduct.

**[Subcommentary]** Responding to things without intent, in harmony with the great Dao’s movement, which generates the myriad things without intent. This is the way to nurture the spirit.

**[Subcommentary]** Summarizing the preceding methods of emulating Heaven’s course—these are the safeguards of bodily governance and the way to nurture the spirit.

One who possesses a sword from Gan and Yue keeps it cased and hidden, daring not use it—this is the utmost in treasuring.

**[Annotation]** How much more should one not lightly use the spirit?

**[Subcommentary]** Gan is a Han name; Yue, a mountain name. Gan and Yue are known for producing fine swords. Alternatively, Gan refers to Wu. Both Wu and Yue are famed for their swords, hence the name. One who possesses such a treasured sword from Gan and Yue keeps it cased and concealed, daring not use it lightly unless faced with a great matter of state. Such is the extent of its value—how much more should one treasure and protect the spirit? The spirit flows and reaches everywhere without limit, extending upward to Heaven and coiling downward upon Earth.

**[Annotation]** One whose spirit embodies the ultimate of Heaven and Earth, responding to the measures of the myriad things, is thus.

If one achieves such a role in the workings of Heaven and Earth, it is by following Heaven’s course, not by using it lightly.

**[Subcommentary]** *Liú* means to flow. One who nurtures the spirit can thus reach the four directions without obstruction. Below, it coils upon the solid Earth; above, it extends to the mysterious Heaven. In all directions, there is nowhere it does not reach. Moving yet ever still, it is not lightly used.

Nurturing and transforming the myriad things, leaving no trace,

**[Annotation]** What is nurtured has no fixed direction.

**[Subcommentary]** Guiding and nourishing all beings, responding to conditions without confinement to one direction—thus it cannot be encompassed by any image.

Its name is "Coinciding with the Emperor." **[Annotation]** Coinciding with the Heavenly Emperor’s non-action. **[Subcommentary]** *Emperor* means to examine. Summarizing what precedes, this is named the Way of examining reality. It may also be said: coinciding with the Heavenly Emperor’s non-action.

The Way of pure simplicity guards only the spirit;
Guard it without loss, and unite with the spirit.
**[Annotation]** Constantly guarding pure simplicity within utmost stillness, without straying outward—thus merging into obscurity.
**[Subcommentary]** The Way of pure essence and unadorned substance lies solely in guarding the spirit. Guarding it without loss, the spirit congeals in stillness, until the body resembles withered wood, the mind like dead ashes—self and things both forgotten, body and spirit become one.

When the unity of essence penetrates, it harmonizes with Heaven’s order.
**[Annotation]** *Essence* is the true nature of things.
**[Subcommentary]** *Order* means principle. Having united with the spirit, essence and wisdom are unimpeded, thus merging with the principle of nature.

A rustic saying goes: the multitude values profit, the incorruptible value reputation, the worthy esteem aspiration;
The sage treasures essence.
**[Annotation]** Uniting with the spirit is not merely guarding the spirit; not straying from one’s essence is not merely treasuring essence—yet the Way indeed values guarding it closely.
**[Subcommentary]** Zhuangzi, wishing to assess the ranks of people, notes their differing aspirations. Thus, he broadly outlines four categories, borrowing the words of recluses to show that such speech lacks precision. The common multitude, numerous in the world, all value wealth and profit—such are thieves and corrupt men. The steadfast and pure, upright in conduct, all value reputation—such were Boyi and Jie Zitui. The worthy and noble, lofty in aspiration, unbending before the world—such were Xu You and Zizhou Zhibo. Only the sage who embodies the Way, free from partiality, can treasure the spirit without being swayed by things. Though responding to change and following the times, they never lose their pure simplicity.

Thus, *simplicity* means having nothing mixed with it;
*Purity* means not diminishing the spirit.
**[Annotation]** If not diminishing is taken as purity, then even if a hundred deeds are performed together, myriad changes are encompassed—this is the utmost purity. If not mixing is taken as simplicity, then even if adorned with dragon patterns and phoenix forms, appearing extraordinary—this is the utmost simplicity. If one cannot preserve their natural substance but mixes it with external adornments, how can even the coarse wool of dogs and sheep be called pure simplicity?
**[Subcommentary]** One who moves through the world without mixing with things is the utmost in simplicity. One who engages in the clamor of change without diminishing the spirit is the utmost in purity. How could one stand alone atop a high mountain, hands folded amid the forest’s whispers, and be called pure and simple? Surely not.

This concludes the explanation of the Way of pure simplicity.

One who embodies pure simplicity is called a *true person*.
**[Subcommentary]** *Embody* means to comprehend. Profoundly aligning with the principle of pure simplicity, one is everywhere in accord with the true Way—thus may be called a person who has attained the true Way.

*Annotations and Commentary on the Southern Florescence True Scripture*, Scroll Seventeen, concludes.

**Master Cheng Xuanying’s Subcommentary on the Outer Chapters, "Mending Nature" (Chapter Sixteen)**

To mend one’s nature amid the vulgar is to study the vulgar in hopes of restoring one’s original state.
**[Annotation]** Having already cultivated one’s nature within the vulgar, one then seeks to use vulgar learning to recover the root of life and destiny—yet the more one seeks, the further one strays from the Way.
**[Subcommentary]** *Mend* means to cultivate; *nature* means life; *vulgar* means habit; *original* means the root. When people observe their inborn nature and each guards their allotted life, following it as it is, they naturally accord with principle. Yet now, through cunning in artificial methods, they treat their true nature, striving to correct it with effort—already exhausted and worn. Then they further practice the seven virtues of ritual, wisdom, and Confucian vulgar learning, seeking to return to their original nature. Thus, the more they grasp the vulgar, the more they lose their nature; the closer they draw to learning, the farther they drift from the Way.

To entangle desire in the vulgar is to ponder in hopes of attaining clarity.
**[Annotation]** Having already disturbed the heart with desire, one then labors thought to seek clarity—yet the more precise the thought, the more distant the loss.
**[Subcommentary]** *Entangle* means to disorder; *attain* means to gain; *desire* refers to such things as fame, profit, sensuality, and other objects of craving. People’s minds become dull and confused because they indulge desire in the vulgar dust. Now, if they employ discriminating thought to study and seek, hoping to obtain the Way of luminous illumination, it is surely impossible. Only by learning without learning can one return to the root; only by thinking without thinking can one attain clarity. Some versions read *entangle desire in desire*.

These are called the people of obscured darkness.
**[Annotation]** As for those who awaken from obscurity, they must first depart from the vulgar and abandon desire.
**[Subcommentary]** *Obscured* means blocked; *darkness* means ignorance. This concludes the preceding: to seek the root through vulgar learning, to pursue clarity through pondering—such people may be called those who are blocked and benighted.

The ancients who cultivated the Way nurtured knowledge with tranquility.
**[Annotation]** Only when tranquil does knowledge not scatter; when knowledge does not scatter, nature is not lost.
**[Subcommentary]** *Tranquility* means stillness. The sages of old who governed themselves and the state with the Way invariably nurtured the knowledge of true essence with the method of tranquility, preventing it from scattering outward.

To live without employing knowledge is called nurturing tranquility with knowledge.
**[Annotation]** To not employ knowledge but let it function naturally is to know all things while remaining serene and self-content.
**[Subcommentary]** To follow nature in illumination is to know life; to know without intent is to *not employ knowledge*. To proceed with knowledge without contrivance is to know without knowing, to know yet be as if not knowing—not the kind of knowing that knows through knowing. Thus, one may know all day yet never have known, yet never have not known; act all day yet never have acted, yet never have not acted. Only thus can true knowledge nurture tranquility. If not so, how could one be tranquil? Knowledge and tranquility nurture each other, and harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature.
**[Annotation]** When knowledge is not contrived, it does no harm to tranquility; when tranquility is self-sufficient, it does no injury to knowledge—this may be called mutual nurturance. When the two nurture each other, from whence does the principle of harmony arise if not from this?
**[Subcommentary]** Without tranquility, how can one give rise to true knowledge? Without true knowledge, how can one govern this tranquility? Thus, tranquility depends on knowledge to attain stillness; knowledge relies on stillness to obtain truth. Therefore, knowledge and tranquility nurture each other. This is the Way of central harmony, residing in the heart; the principle of spontaneity, issuing from heaven’s nature. It lies within oneself—how could it relate to anything else?

Virtue is harmony; the Way is principle.
**[Annotation]** Harmony, thus nothing is not attained; the Way, thus nothing is not ordered.
**[Subcommentary]** Virtue is bestowed upon people, hence its meaning is central harmony; principle pervades all things, hence its name is the great Way.

Virtue that admits all is benevolence.
**[Annotation]** That which admits all does not act for benevolence, yet the seven virtues are all present.
**[Subcommentary]** Profound virtue is vast and deep, admitting all without limit; its boundless compassion and love manifest as benevolence.

The Way that orders all is righteousness.
**[Annotation]** That which orders all does not act for righteousness, yet the function of righteousness is evident.
**[Subcommentary]** The Way can penetrate all things, each in accord with its principle; when principle is fitting, the function of righteousness is evident.

When righteousness is clear and things draw near, it is loyalty.
**[Annotation]** If righteousness is clear yet not rooted in loyalty, things grow ever more distant.
**[Subcommentary]** When the principle of righteousness is manifest and the heart follows within, without arrogance, things naturally draw near.

When the center is pure and real, returning to emotion, it is joy.
**[Annotation]** When benevolence and righteousness arise from within and return to rest in the original heart, the will is fulfilled—when the will is fulfilled, its advance is joy.
**[Subcommentary]** Since benevolence and righteousness proceed from within, the will and nature are pure and real. Though one may engage with the world, the heart invariably returns to true emotion; the attainment of harmony and ease is called joy.

When trust in conduct, bearing, and form accords with pattern, it is ritual.
**[Annotation]** When trust in conduct, bearing, and form accords with the natural patterns of order, its practice is ritual.
**[Subcommentary]** When trust in conduct is evident, bearing and demeanor guide things without deviating from pattern—its meritorious practice is ritual.

When ritual and music are practiced in a biased manner, the world falls into chaos.
**[Annotation]** To apply what one part practices and what one will delights in to the whole world is for one side to gain while ten thousand sides lose.
**[Subcommentary]** Those who cannot respond to things with an empty heart but instead cling to partiality to govern the world invariably become mired in ornate ritual and drowned in licentious music. Thus, when straw dogs are set out again, the world falls into chaos.

Those who align with the correct yet remain veiled in their own virtue—such virtue does not overreach. To overreach is to cause all things to lose their nature.
**[Annotation]** Each aligns with their nature and destiny, veiling themselves in their own virtue, thus not imposing one upon the other. If one imposes upon another, how can their nature not be lost?
**[Subcommentary]** *Veiled* means obscured; *overreach* means disorder. *Those* refers to the sages who walk the correct Dao. If officials overreach and disorder, then self and others lose their nature.

In ancient times, amidst primordial chaos, people lived in harmony with their age and attained tranquility.
**[Subcommentary]** This refers to the rulers before the Three Sovereigns, those nameless lords of remote antiquity. In that era, the pure wind had not yet scattered, so they dwelled in undifferentiated obscurity, becoming one with their time. Profoundly without artifice, ruler and subject, high and low, did not interact—all attained the Dao of serenity, stillness, and non-action. At that time, yin and yang harmonized in stillness; ghosts and spirits did not disturb; the four seasons kept their rhythm; the myriad things were unharmed; the multitudes did not die young. Though humans possessed knowledge, they had no use for it.
**[Annotation]** They simply followed their natural course.
**[Subcommentary]** In that undifferentiated, unadulterated age, the world was content, embodying non-action. Thus, yin rose and yang descended, the two breaths harmonized in tranquility; ghosts remained hidden and humans visible, each keeping to their place without disturbance. Heat and cold followed their order; the four seasons kept their rhythm—no disasters arose, the myriad things were unharmed, and all beings fulfilled their natural lifespans without premature death. Though humans possessed the faculty of discernment, they acted without contrivance, so it was of no use. This is called *perfect unity*. At that time, none acted, yet all was constantly natural.
**[Annotation]** All things were natural, hence *perfect unity*.
**[Subcommentary]** They blended self and other in non-action, merged right and wrong in tranquility—self and things were not two, hence *perfect unity*. *None* means "not." None acted, yet all acted—this is non-action. Not knowing why it was so, yet it was so—this is naturalness. Thus, at that time, humans embraced the virtue of non-action, and things accorded with the Dao of naturalness.

When virtue further declined,
**[Annotation]** The reason virtue declined was that sages did not succeed one another. Those in power could not practice non-action but envied the achievements of non-action, thus governance became corrupt.
it reached the time of Suiren and Fuxi, who first ruled the world—hence they followed but were not unified.
**[Annotation]** The world had already lost unity; some matters could not be undone, so they were resolved without insistence, merely followed.
**[Subcommentary]** *Reached* means "arrived." In ancient times, people ate raw meat and drank blood, living like deer. Then Suiren first changed raw to cooked, and Fuxi tamed oxen and rode horses, established kitchens, drew the Eight Trigrams, and created writing. Imitating spiders, he wove fine nets. From this, cunning and deceit sprouted; desires gradually arose, eroding the heart of purity and scattering the Dao of non-action. Virtue declined, and thus began ruling the world—this is what is meant. They followed the people’s hearts but could not merge into *perfect unity*.

When virtue declined further,
it reached the time of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, who first ruled the world—hence they brought peace but did not follow.
**[Annotation]** They found peace in what was peaceful, and that was all.
**[Subcommentary]** As virtue and governance further declined, corruption worsened. Thus, Shennong fought Gonggong, and the Yellow Emperor battled Chiyou—ominous forces did not cease, and warfare frequently arose. Therefore, they punished the violent and removed the cruel, offering solace to the people and questioning the guilty—merely seeking to pacify the world, they could not fully follow the natural course of living beings.

When virtue declined still further,
it reached the time of Tang and Yu, who first ruled the world, initiating the flow of governance and culture, dissipating purity and scattering simplicity.
**[Annotation]** Sages have no fixed intent; they allow the world to fulfill itself. Whether it becomes pure or coarse depends not on the sages. Sages can only allow the world to attain its own fulfillment—how could they make the world attain the sages? Thus, the achievements of emperors and kings change with the times, while the Dao of sages remains ever whole.
**[Subcommentary]** Tang Yao and Yu Shun stood at the end of the Five Emperors and initiated the governance of the Three Kings. They established the Five Constants to regulate the five phases, appointed officials to govern the people—yet the people grew cunning, the five phases waned, and their branches and streams divided, continuing to this day. Was this not the destruction of purity to create artifice, the scattering of simplicity to fabricate falsity?

They departed from the Dao to pursue goodness,
**[Annotation]** *Goodness* is a term for exceeding what is fitting; thus, there is goodness, but the Dao is not whole.
**[Subcommentary]** The Dao of emptiness and penetration forgets both good and evil. Now, imitating others and boasting of one’s name in pursuit of goodness departs from principle—hence it is called *departure*.

and practiced virtue through perilous conduct.
**[Annotation]** *Practice* means acting contrary to nature; thus, conduct is established, but virtue is not level.
**[Subcommentary]** *Perilous* means treacherous. Unable to follow nature and act genuinely, concealing their traces, they feigned conduct to gain fame. Yet fame is superficial, so inner virtue became endangered—how could it remain pure and level?

Then they abandoned nature and followed the heart.
**[Annotation]** To be driven by the heart is to lose nature.
**[Subcommentary]** Departing from the Dao of emptiness and penetration, discarding the virtue of purity and harmony, they then abandoned natural nature and followed the discriminating heart.

Heart contended with heart,
**[Annotation]** Each heart strove to be first in discernment, no longer following nature.
**[Subcommentary]** Each heart schemed against the other, competing in judgment, right and wrong, praise and blame—vying to be first in discernment.

and knowledge was insufficient to bring order to the world.
**[Annotation]** Forgetting knowledge and following nature—this is true order.
**[Subcommentary]** The heart clings to objects, knowledge discriminates without end—the six directions become obscured by dust, the eight wilds surge in turmoil. Thus, the four seasons lose their order, and the three luminaries blaze with comets.

Thus is the source of calamity and chaos—how could it suffice to bring order to the world? Thereafter, they adorned it with culture and augmented it with erudition. Culture extinguished substance, erudition drowned the heart.

**[Annotation]** Culture and erudition are but ornaments of the heart’s substance.
**[Subcommentary]** Having already set the heart to wield knowledge, which proved insufficient to order the world, they then relied on written culture to rectify the times and multiplied learning to save the age—unaware that substance is the root of culture, and that florid embellishment obscures plain essence; that erudition is but the branch of the heart, and that vast learning submerges the spirit’s clarity. Only by cutting off learning and discarding culture can one attain the beauty of non-action. Thereafter, the people became deluded and disordered, unable to return to their nature and feelings or recover their origin.

**[Annotation]** Origin refers to the root of nature and destiny.
**[Subcommentary]** Once florid culture has extinguished plain essence and vast learning has drowned the heart’s clarity, the people then fall into turmoil. How could they return to their tranquil nature or restore their original, natural state?

Alas! The heart’s knowledge and cultural erudition are the fault. From this perspective, the world has lost the Way, and the Way has lost the world. World and Way mutually destroy one another.

**[Annotation]** The Way, being without esteem, can thus preserve the world. Yet if the world preserves it, it esteems the Way—and in esteeming it, the Way is lost. The Way cannot prevent the world from esteeming it, nor can the world cease to esteem the Way. Thus, they mutually destroy one another.
**[Subcommentary]** *Sang* means to abandon. Observing the course of events, one knows that the frivolous, floating world has discarded the Way of non-action, just as the Way of non-action has transformed the world’s simplicity and harmony. Thus, world and Way mutually destroy one another. How could the person of the Way arise in the world, or the world arise in the Way?

**[Annotation]** If not esteemed, they would mutually arise.
**[Subcommentary]** Therefore, the sage who embraces the Way withdraws from the dust of the vulgar, unwilling to arise and govern the world. And how could the frivolous, deceitful world be moved by the sagely Way? The Way has no means to arise in the world, nor the world any means to arise in the Way. Though the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, his virtue is hidden.

**[Annotation]** The reason he does not hide now is due to his sentiment to arise. How could he arise? By lacking esteem.
**[Subcommentary]** In this degenerate age, the Way of non-action is no longer practiced. Even if the sage who embodies the Way were to descend into the world and mingle with the common, none would recognize him. Concealing his sagely virtue, he would go unrecognized and unused. Though dwelling in the marketplace, how would he differ from the mountains and forests? Hidden, yet not by his own choice.

**[Annotation]** If one hides oneself yet employs things, then Way and world mutually arise—what hiding is there?
**[Subcommentary]** The times are benighted and chaotic, so the sagely Way does not prevail. Is this because the sage conceals his light and hides his virtue? The so-called recluses of old did not crouch in concealment and refuse to be seen, nor did they seal their words and refuse to speak, nor hide their knowledge and never express it. The fault lies in the great error of the times.

**[Annotation]** None know to return to the One and cease striving, but instead pursue advancement to seek the One. The more they strive, the more they lose the One—this is the great error. Though one were to rise and clarify it, open one’s mouth to speak, or display knowledge to express it, how could mutual arising come about? It would only lead to mutual destruction.
**[Subcommentary]** *Miu* means false and deluded. They did not conceal their bodies and refuse to appear—though appearing, they did not disturb the common; they did not seal their words and refuse to speak—though speaking, they did not offend others.

Those who do not conceal their wisdom and refuse to express it—though they express it, they do not flaunt it—yet encounter false and deluded times, their fate meeting with misfortune, thus follow the world’s rise and fall, preserving themselves and keeping harm at bay. When the times align with their fate and they flourish throughout the world—

**[Annotation]** This is a time of tranquility and stillness.
Then they return to the One without proximity;
**[Annotation]** They return to and entrust themselves to the nature of things, and the nature of things unites of itself—thus there is no entanglement.

**[Subcommentary]** When the times align with the Dao and fate rests in clarity and peace, they spread virtue and magnify transformation, flourishing throughout the world. As each person returns to the One and every thing reverts to its root, self and other merge in darkness—thus there is no trace of striving.

When the times do not align with their fate and they are greatly constrained throughout the world—
**[Annotation]** This is a time when tranquility and stillness cannot be attained.
Then they deepen their roots and settle into the utmost stillness to await;
**[Annotation]** Though it be an age of affairs, the sage has never not been tranquil and still—thus they deepen their roots and settle into the utmost stillness, awaiting things to unfold of themselves. This is how the Dao is not lost.

**[Subcommentary]** When the times are without the Dao and fate meets with excess and disorder, their virtue and transformation do not spread, and they are greatly constrained throughout the world. Yet they firmly establish the root of spontaneity, preserve and settle into the utmost nature, arrange themselves and follow change, abide in constancy and await the end of the year—how could success or failure bring joy or sorrow to them? This is the Way of preserving the self.

**[Annotation]** There has never been a case where the self was preserved and the world did not flourish.

**[Subcommentary]** Abiding in hardship yet ever joyful, dwelling in peril yet at peace—entrusting themselves to the times’ flourishing or concealment, this may be called the Way of preserving the self.

The ancients who preserved their selves did not employ eloquence to adorn knowledge;
**[Annotation]** They entrusted themselves to their true knowledge alone.
**[Subcommentary]** The ancients valued reticence over eloquence, prized action over words—thus those who preserved their selves did not rely on florid speech to embellish or on discriminating cleverness to adorn petty wisdom.

Nor did they use knowledge to constrain the world;
**[Annotation]** This is the disposition of tranquility and simplicity.

**[Subcommentary]** "Exhaustion" refers to being bound and burdened. They did not indulge in the poison of knowledge to bring suffering upon the common people. Nor did they use knowledge to exhaust virtue.
**[Annotation]** They guarded their self-attainment alone.
**[Subcommentary]** Knowing the limits of their allotment, they did not allow boundlessness to burden their self-attainment. Uprightly abiding in their place, they fulfilled their nature—what more was there to do?

**[Annotation]** "Uprightly" describes a solitary and steadfast demeanor.
**[Subcommentary]** "Upright" means solitary. Living alone amid a chaotic world, dwelling in peril yet ever at peace, their movements did not disturb stillness. Constantly returning to their natural nature, following it in action—what else was there to do? This speaks of their non-action.

The Dao is fundamentally not a petty practice;
**[Annotation]** It roams the level path.
**[Subcommentary]** The great Dao is vast and unobstructed, encompassing all without constraint. Petty accomplishments conceal the Dao—thus it is fundamentally not a petty practice.

Virtue is fundamentally not a petty discernment;
**[Annotation]** It is utterly and greatly penetrating.
**[Subcommentary]** Those of supreme virtue, whose wisdom pervades the myriad things, do not fix their attention on right and wrong to make petty judgments. Petty discernment harms virtue; petty practice harms the Dao.

**[Subcommentary]** Petty discernment and petty knowledge diminish the profound and mysterious abundance of virtue; petty learning and petty practice injure and destroy the vast and unobstructed great Dao. Thus it is said: rectify the self and that is all. "Joy in wholeness" is called "attaining one’s aspiration."

**[Annotation]** Attaining one’s aspiration means being content in one’s heart alone, free from the emotions of sorrow and joy—this is the wholeness of joy.
**[Subcommentary]** When one’s own conduct aligns with the right Dao, all actions become unobstructed. Then, without compliance or resistance, forgetting sorrow and joy, every endeavor is fitting—this is the wholeness of joy. Only when joy is wholly complete does one’s nature and aspiration attain fulfillment.

What the ancients called "attaining one’s aspiration" did not refer to noble rank and emolument, but rather to having nothing to add to their joy.
**[Annotation]** Being complete within and sufficient.
**[Subcommentary]** "Add" means to augment.

Chariots are called *xuan*; crowns are called *mian*. The ancients were simple and unadorned, embodying the Dao in non-action. Their fulfillment of aspiration lay in tranquility and equanimity, and their joy was not tied to chariots and crowns. Their joy was already sufficient—how could it require augmentation?

What people today call "attaining one’s aspiration" refers to chariots and crowns.
**[Subcommentary]** In this degenerate age, most are frivolous and superficial, craving splendor and rank, seeking contentment in such things. Thus, they regard donning crowns and riding chariots as the fulfillment of aspiration. Yet chariots and crowns are not of one’s nature and destiny; they are transient things that come by chance—mere lodgings.
**[Subcommentary]** *Transient* means arriving unexpectedly. Chariots and crowns, glory and splendor, are external to the self. What comes by chance is not of one’s nature and destiny—it is but a temporary lodging, how could it endure? When lodged, its coming cannot be warded off; its going cannot be halted.
**[Annotation]** They are external things—gain and loss do not pertain to the self.
**[Subcommentary]** When the time comes by chance, one casually assumes chariots and crowns; when fate dictates their departure, one calmly relinquishes glory and splendor. Since there is no intent to control or resist, how could there be attachment to retention or fear of loss? Thus, one does not indulge one’s aspirations for chariots and crowns,
**[Annotation]** One remains serene and unperturbed, unaware of their presence as lodgings.
nor does one follow worldly trends in poverty and constraint,
**[Annotation]** One remains open and self-content, unaware of poverty’s presence.
**[Subcommentary]** *Indulge* means to extend; *follow* means to vie. The ancients understood that prosperity and adversity were matters of destiny, and that glory and decay were not of the self. Even if chariots and crowns came their way, they were not enough to extend their joy; even in humble poverty, they did not vie with the clamorous world. Their joy was the same in both,
**[Annotation]** *Both* refers to chariots and crowns, and to poverty and constraint.
**[Subcommentary]** Chariots and crowns, poverty and constraint—both are transient. If one delights in chariots and crowns, one must also rejoice in poverty and constraint, for both are mere lodgings and thus the same. Therefore, one is without sorrow.
**[Annotation]** Nor is there joy in delight.
**[Subcommentary]** Not delighting in chariots and crowns, not suffering in poverty and constraint—accepting transformation as it comes, this is why one is without sorrow. If one is displeased when the lodging departs, then from this we see that even in joy, one is not without distraction.
**[Annotation]** If one is displeased when the lodging departs, then when it arrives, one is distracted—this is to let the external alter the internal.
**[Subcommentary]** People today, with their shallow understanding, rejoice when things come by chance and grieve when they depart. How do they not know that both are transient, that coming and going are mere lodgings? Constant sorrow, constant joy—thus, though they may rejoice, their hearts are never free from distraction. Therefore, it is said: those who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to custom are called "the people of inverted priorities."
**[Annotation]** Seeking the external at the expense of the internal is the height of inversion.
**[Subcommentary]** Coming and going by chance, now grieving, now rejoicing—if one subordinates oneself to things, how is this not loss? Chariots and crowns, poverty and constraint—all belong to the dust of the world. If one follows worldly custom and loses one’s original nature, turning from truth and the Dao, the fault lies in misplaced priorities. What they take as security is truly inversion.

Variorum editions note that the Zhang Junfang edition includes the characters *zhi you* (之有) after *ming* (命). The Zhejiang Library and Siku editions render the four characters *shen daozhi ye* (甚倒置也) as *qi daozhi ye* (其倒置也).

**Cheng Xuanying of the Tang, Master of Western Florescence, Subcommentary**
**Outer Chapters, "Autumn Floods," Seventeenth**

When autumn floods arrive, the hundred streams pour into the River. The vastness of its currents swells so that between its banks and isles, oxen and horses cannot be distinguished.

**[Annotation]** This speaks of its breadth.
**[Subcommentary]** The River refers to Meng Ford. *Jing* means "to flow through." *Yu* means "bank," and *ya* means "edge." *Zhu* means "islet"—a place in water that may be inhabited is called an islet. Great waters arise in spring and flourish in autumn. In the white autumn, yin darkness grows fierce, and heavy rains prevail, so that in autumn the waters arrive.

Thereupon, all valleys and streams pour into the Yellow River. Its flowing currents fill to overflowing, its waters vast. Its banks stretch wide, its isles lie distant, so that when gazing across the water, one cannot tell ox from horse.

Then the River Lord rejoices, delighting in himself, believing all the world’s beauty to be contained within him.

**[Subcommentary]** The River Lord is the spirit of the River. His surname is Feng, his given name Yi. He was a native of Tongguan Township in Huayin and attained the Dao of water immortality. Since the River was so vast, he rejoiced in his grandeur, thinking all the world’s glory and splendor resided in himself.

Following the current eastward, he came to the Northern Sea. Facing east and gazing out, he saw no end to the water. Then the River Lord turned his countenance, looked toward Ruo across the vast expanse, and sighed: "There is a rustic saying: 'Having heard a hundred ways of the Dao, one thinks none can compare to oneself.' This describes me."

**[Subcommentary]** The Northern Sea is present-day Laizhou. *Wangyang* means "indistinct." Water and sunlight reflect one another, hence *wangyang*. Ruo is the spirit of the sea. The River Lord, following the current eastward, reached the great sea. Glancing back, he saw no end to the water. Only then did he turn his countenance, gazing up at the sea spirit Ruo, and with a sigh, voiced his lament in rustic words. Though the hundred streams are but one ten-thousandth of the whole, they are truly not enough to boast of—yet he had believed none could compare to himself. This describes the River Lord. Such is the talk of the countryside, not a universal truth.

Moreover, I have heard of those who slight Confucius’s learning and belittle Boyi’s righteousness. At first, I did not believe it. Now that I have seen the boundlessness of your realm, had I not come to your gate, I would have remained deluded. I would long have been ridiculed by those of great attainment.

**[Annotation]** Knowing one’s smallness and not presuming grandeur—this is the natural order of principle. There is no place for arrogance in such matters.
**[Subcommentary]** The world regards Confucius, who edited and fixed the Six Classics, as one of vast learning and broad knowledge, and Boyi, who yielded his kingdom and lived in purity, as one whose righteousness is weighty. Yet there are those of insight and eloquence who, in lofty discourse, dismiss Boyi’s righteousness as trivial and Confucius’s learning as meager. The River Lord had heard of this but did not believe it. Now, seeing the vastness of the great sea, its boundlessness impossible to fathom, he realizes that what he had heard before was not baseless. Had the River Lord not come to the gate of the sea spirit Ruo, his affairs would have been in grave peril. His vision was narrow and inferior, so he would long have been mocked by those of the great Dao.

The sea spirit Ruo said: "You cannot speak of the sea to a frog in a well—it is constrained by its dwelling. You cannot speak of ice to a summer insect—it is bound by its season. You cannot speak of the Dao to a narrow-minded scholar—he is shackled by his teachings."

**[Annotation]** All things that arise and find peace do so within their own limits.
**[Subcommentary]** The sea spirit Ruo, knowing the River Lord’s limitations, offers three analogies. The frog in the well, hearing of the great sea with its hundred-foot waves even in calm winds, refuses to believe it—it is constrained by its dwelling. The insect born in summer dies when autumn comes. Hearing of winter’s time, when water turns to ice and rain congeals into sleet, it refuses to believe—its heart is thick with summer’s time. The narrow-minded scholar, a man of rigid views, hearing of the all-pervading Dao—of transcending sagacity and abandoning cunning, of making the tip of a hair great and Mount Tai small, of making the short-lived equal to Pengzu—refuses to believe. He is bound by the teachings of names and rituals. The River Lord, never having reached the great river, never having met the sea spirit Ruo, prided himself on his grandeur—his case is the same.

Now that you have emerged from your narrow confines and beheld the great sea, you know your own inadequacy. You may now be spoken to of great principles.

**[Annotation]** Because he knows his place, he may be spoken to of principle.
**[Subcommentary]** The River Lord, riding the waters and following the current, surpassed the banks and isles. Meeting the sea spirit Ruo, he gazed upon the boundless abyss of the vast sea and belittled the pettiness of his own river. Having realized the limits of his dwelling, he may now be spoken to of the all-pervading great principle.

Of all the waters under heaven, none is greater than the sea. The ten thousand streams flow into it, yet it never fills—one does not know when it will cease. Its tail-gate drains it, yet it never empties—one does not know when this will end. It remains unchanged through spring and autumn, unmoved by flood or drought. Its surpassing of the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow River cannot be measured.

**[Subcommentary]** The *weilu* is the place where the sea’s waters drain. It lies east of the Azure Sea. There is a stone there, forty thousand *li* wide and forty thousand *li* thick, situated at the tail end of the hundred streams, serving as a barrier—hence it is called the *weilu*. When the sea’s waters pour over it, they scorch it, so it is also called the Scorched Sea. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says: "Yi shot down nine suns, which fell and became the Scorched Sea."

This discourse is fanciful and will not be discussed in detail here. In spring, the rains are scant; in autumn, they are abundant. Yao suffered floods, while Tang endured drought. Thus, the sea as a thing receives the flow of all rivers yet never fills; though the Scorched Sea drains it, it never empties. Through spring and autumn, its volume remains unchanged; in flood or drought, its rise and fall go unnoticed. In its vastness, it far surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow River—how could one speak of measuring its superiority or inferiority?

Yet I have never taken pride in this, for I compare my form to Heaven and Earth and receive my qi from yin and yang. I exist between Heaven and Earth as a mere pebble or twig upon a great mountain. Even as I recognize my own smallness, why should I take pride?

**[Annotation]** When one measures the capacity of all rivers against the Yellow River, and the Yellow River against the sea, and the sea against Heaven and Earth, each has its own measure.

This rhetoric seems to suggest that observing the great can clarify the small, but upon closer examination, it does not. What the world finds troubling is not levelness. Thus, those of great stature blithely dismiss the small as nothing, while those of small stature stubbornly declare the great to be utterly sufficient. This leads to boasting above and below, to self-doubt in looking up and down—such is the confusion of the people. To correct this confusion, nothing is better than first exhausting the differences between things and then following their inherent claims.

What is called "great" is utterly sufficient, so even an autumn hair cannot burden Heaven and Earth. What is called "small" has nothing in excess, so Heaven and Earth cannot surpass an autumn hair. Only then can the confused find their way back, each knowing its limit. Things rest in their allotted places, and those who wander freely use their natural steps to roam in the realm of self-contentment. This is how Zhuangzi gives voice to virtue.

If, as the confused claim, one were to constantly weigh small against great, the mutual overthrow would never end. If one gazes upon the great yet cannot be content with the small, or looks upon the small and takes pride in it, one will rush into the realm of victory and defeat, aiding the world’s people in their arrogance. How could this be in accord with Zhuangzi’s intent?

**[Subcommentary]** *Cun* means "to exist." *Xi* means "how." There is nothing greater than Heaven and Earth in covering and supporting the myriad things, nothing greater than yin and yang in setting boundaries and engendering transformation. Thus, when the Sea Spirit compares its form to Heaven and Earth, there is no rank in which to place it. To say it receives its dark essence from yin and yang is to treat it as one thing among yin and yang’s manifestations. Using things as metaphors, it is like a small stone or twig upon Mount Tai. Thus, the Sea Spirit, in the principle of Heaven, exists in scarcity. Each thing has its measure—how could it be cause for pride?

Consider the Four Seas within Heaven and Earth—are they not like a sunbeam’s gap in a great marsh? Consider the Central States within the seas—are they not like a grain of *ti* rice in a vast granary?

**[Subcommentary]** *Xunkong* refers to an ant’s nest. *Ti* is a grass resembling *pai*, but its grains are exceedingly fine. The Central States refer to the Nine Provinces. The Four Seas within Heaven and Earth, the Nine Provinces within the Four Seas—are they not like an ant’s hole in a great marsh, a grain of *ti* rice in a vast granary? Such is the disparity in their greatness and smallness.

The number of things is called "ten thousand," and humans are one among them. Humans gather in the Nine Provinces, where grain is grown and boats and carts travel—yet humans are but one among them. Compared to the ten thousand things, is this not like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body?

**[Annotation]** The distinction between small and great has its own gradations; they cannot be transgressed.

**[Subcommentary]** *Hao* means "to name." *Zu* means "multitude." The number of things is not limited to ten thousand, but in worldly speech, the ten thousand things are often mentioned. Humans are one thing among these ten thousand. The Nine Provinces are where people gather, where the hundred grains grow, where boats and carts travel—yet among the ten thousand things, humans are but one. Thus, comparing humans to the ten thousand things, the Nine Provinces to the cosmos, is no different from a single hair on a horse’s body. How could this be worth concern?

The connections of the Five Emperors, the struggles of the Two Kings, the worries of the benevolent, the labors of the capable—all are confined to this.

**[Annotation]** They do not extend beyond a single domain.

**[Subcommentary]** The Five Emperors passed the throne in succession, the Three Kings waged war in competition, the wise worried over the altars of soil and grain, the capable toiled in their duties. Though their endeavors differed, all were exhausted within the tip of a hair. Boyi refused the throne to make a name for himself; Confucius discoursed on the *Six Classics* to display his vast knowledge. In their self-pride, are they not like the River Spirit’s earlier boasting of its waters?

**[Annotation]** Things have their fixed domains; even the most knowledgeable cannot transcend them. Thus, the distinction between great and small is meant to clarify that the ultimate principle has no gradations.

**[Subcommentary]** Boyi declined the five ranks to establish his reputation; Confucius expounded on the *Six Classics* to demonstrate his erudition. Taking these lightly and priding oneself on them—how is this different from the River Spirit’s earlier boasting of its waters? This comprehensively unites the earlier metaphors and revisits the earlier point about belittling Confucius’s learning and Boyi’s righteousness.

The River Spirit said: "Then may I consider myself great as Heaven and Earth and small as the tip of a hair?"

**[Subcommentary]** In form, nothing is greater than Heaven and Earth; in substance, nothing is smaller than the tip of a hair. Thus, the extremes of great and small are used to show that allotted portions differ. The River Spirit presents what it has understood and inquires of the Sea Spirit.

Another interpretation: If sufficiency is considered great, then I may be greater than the Two Forces. If having nothing in excess is considered small, then I may be smaller than the tip of a hair.

The River Spirit, having grasped this, equalizes self and other to dispel its confusion and asks whether this is permissible.

The Sea Spirit of the Northern Sea said: "No."

For things, their measures are boundless.

**[Commentary]** Each thing has its own measure.

**[Subcommentary]** Having grasped the doubt, the answer is "no." The capacity of things differs according to their allotted portions; each receives what it is given and finds its proper measure. Yet with a thousand differences and ten thousand distinctions, their kinds are infinite. In their proper measure, there is neither great nor small—how could one arbitrarily impose what one knows and take it as fixed?

Time does not cease.

**[Commentary]** Death and life are both the movement of time.

**[Subcommentary]** Renewing without end.

Allotment is not constant.

**[Commentary]** Gain and loss are both allotment.

**[Subcommentary]** The allotted mandate one receives changes with time.

Beginning and end are not fixed.

**[Commentary]** Ever-renewing.

**[Subcommentary]** Though it ends only to begin again, it is never not new.

Thus, the great in wisdom observes both far and near, so the small is not deficient,

**[Commentary]** Each is self-sufficient.

**[Subcommentary]** The following explains the boundlessness of measure. With the wisdom of the great sage, one observes distant principles and examines nearby affairs. Thus, though the tip of a hair is small, in its own body it is self-sufficient, lacking nothing.

and the great is not excessive.

**[Commentary]** Nor does it have surplus.

**[Subcommentary]** Though Heaven and Earth are vast, in their own body they have no surplus, and thus are not sufficient to be considered excessive. Without excess, there is no boasting; without deficiency, there is no longing. Knowing measure is boundless,

**[Commentary]** Observing and examining, one knows that things both far and near, great and small, each have their measure.

**[Subcommentary]** With the wisdom of the great person, one knows the measure of things. Though great and small differ, each accords with its nature. Their names differ, and thus they are boundless. This concludes the previous point on the boundlessness of things’ measure.

Verifying the present by the past,

**[Commentary]** *Wu* means "to clarify." *Jin gu* means "past and present."

**[Subcommentary]** The following explains the ceaselessness of time. *Wu* means "to clarify." Having known that small and great are not truly small or great, one thereby clarifies that past and present are not truly past or present. Thus, though distant, one is not perplexed;

**[Commentary]** *Yao* means "long."

though brief, one is not divided.

**[Commentary]** *Rang* means "short."

**[Subcommentary]** *Yao* means "long," *rang* means "short." Having known that past and present are not truly past or present, one knows that long life and early death are not truly long or short. Thus, though one’s years and mandate extend long, one never wearies of life or seeks answers; though one’s allotted span is brief, one does not rejoice in or long for distant longevity. Following change and submitting to transformation, one has never not been oneself. Knowing time does not cease,

**[Commentary]** Clarifying past and present, one knows that transformation does not stop at death and life. Thus, one does not seek answers because of length nor stumble because of brevity.

**[Subcommentary]** This concludes the previous point on the ceaselessness of time.

Examining fullness and emptiness, one gains without delight and loses without sorrow.

**[Subcommentary]** The following explains the inconstancy of allotment. Since the Way of Heaven has fullness and emptiness, how could human affairs lack gain and loss? Thus, observing the changes of fullness and emptiness and understanding the principle of gain and loss, one may happen to gain—this is a matter of time, not cause for joy; one may happen to lose—this is a matter of mandate, not cause for grief. Knowing allotment is inconstant,

**[Commentary]** Observing the alternation of fullness and emptiness, one knows that allotment is not constant in gain. Thus, one can forget both sorrow and joy.

**[Subcommentary]** This concludes the previous point on the inconstancy of allotment.

Illuminating the level path,

**[Commentary]** Death and life are the proper Way of daily renewal.

**[Subcommentary]** The following explains the unfixedness of beginning and end. *Tan* means "level," *tu* means "path." Not taking death as death, not taking life as life, death and life are without barrier. Such is the illumination of the great, level, and equal Way. Thus, living, one does not rejoice; dying, one does not consider it a calamity.

**[Subcommentary]** For one who illuminates the level Way, life is not cause for joy, nor is death cause for ruin. Having penetrated the non-duality of death and life, what sorrow or joy could there be to discuss? Knowing beginning and end cannot be fixed,

**[Commentary]** Illuminating the daily renewal of beginning and end, one knows that the fixed cannot be grasped or retained. Thus, one traverses daily renewal without surprise, relinquishes the old without alarm, and the transformation of death and life is as one.

**[Subcommentary]** This concludes the previous point on the unfixedness of beginning and end.

Calculating what people know, it does not compare to what they do not know.

**[Commentary]** What is known has its limits.

**[Subcommentary]** Forced knowing departs from the real; not-knowing accords with the Way. By this calculation, one should indeed not compare.

The time of their life does not compare to the time before they were born.

**[Commentary]** The time of life has its years.

**[Subcommentary]** Before birth, there is no joy and thus no sorrow; after birth, there is attachment and thus aversion. To seek to exhaust the realm of the utmost great with the utmost small is to become confused and unable to attain oneself.

**[Commentary]** There is nothing better than to rest in one’s allotted portion.

**[Subcommentary]** The utmost small is wisdom; the utmost great is the realm. To seek the boundless realm of the great with the limited wisdom of the small—before the boundless realm is encompassed, the limited wisdom is already lost. Thus, one is confused for a lifetime, with no way to return to the root, losing oneself in longing for things and failing to attain oneself.

Thus, how could one know that the tip of a hair suffices to determine the limit of the finest? How could one know that Heaven and Earth suffice to exhaust the realm of the greatest?

**[Commentary]** Seeking the great with the small, one ultimately cannot attain it. Each resting in its allotted portion, both great and small are sufficient. If the tip of a hair did not seek the achievement of Heaven and Earth, then the surplus of the whole body would all be discarded things. If Heaven and Earth did not see themselves as greater than an autumn hair, then regarding their form and image, they would merely be self-sufficient. How then could one know the fineness of the fine or the greatness of the great?

**[Subcommentary]** The allotted portions of things each differ; though great and small are distinct, all find their proper measure.

If one seeks the great with the small, one becomes deluded and loses one’s nature; each resting in its allotted portion, both achieve the same freedom. Thus, though the tip of a hair is small, its nature may be called great; though the Two Modes are vast, they have no surplus that could be called small. From this perspective, how can the limit of the finest be definitively fixed in the tip of a hair, or the realm of the greatest be exhausted by Heaven and Earth?

The River Earl said: “Those who discuss such matters in the world all say: ‘The most refined has no form; the greatest cannot be encompassed.’ Is this a true reflection of reality?”

**[Subcommentary]** *True* means real. Common discourse has not yet distinguished right from wrong, asserting that the most refined and subtle lacks form and substance, while the most vast and boundless cannot be encircled. It does not know whether this principle is a matter of genuine insight or mere conjecture. The River Earl, not yet understanding, thus raises this doubt.

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: “One who views the great from the perspective of the small cannot exhaust it; one who views the small from the perspective of the great cannot clarify it.”

**[Commentary]** The eye’s vision has a fixed limit and cannot extend infinitely. Thus, regarding the great, there is always something it cannot exhaust; regarding the small, there is always something it cannot clarify. This is simply what the eye cannot reach. Both the refined and the vast are not nonexistent—how could one rashly claim that what has no form cannot be encompassed?

**[Subcommentary]** When a small form gazes upon a vast object, it can never fully grasp its vastness, hence it is said to be “unencircled.” When a vast object observes a small form, it cannot clearly discern its details, hence it is said to have “no form or substance.” These are merely limitations of the realm of existence—how could they represent the meaning of ultimate nonexistence? The refined is the subtlest of the small; the vast is the most expansive of the great—thus their conveniences differ.

**[Commentary]** Great and small differ, so their conveniences cannot be the same.

**[Subcommentary]** *Refined* means subtle and small; *vast* means expansive and great. To clarify that the smallest of the small and the greatest of the great, though differing in the qi they receive, do not depart from having form, the natural mechanism unfolds, each with its proper convenience. This is the condition of existence.

**[Commentary]** If there were no form and it could not be encompassed, there would be no such differing conveniences.

**[Subcommentary]** Since great and small differ, their conveniences also vary—thus we know this condition has not transcended the realm of existence. The refined and the coarse are bound to having form.

**[Commentary]** Where there is refinement and coarseness, there cannot be an absence of form.

**[Subcommentary]** When speaking of the refined and the coarse, one is always confined to the realm of form and name, never transcending the bounds of language and image. What has no form cannot be divided by calculation; what cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by calculation.

**[Subcommentary]** What has no form and cannot be encompassed is the Dao. The profound mystery of the supreme Dao is beyond mind and form, thus it cannot be distinguished by names or numbers, nor can it be exhausted by calculation. What can be discussed in words is the coarse aspect of things; what can be grasped by intention is the refined aspect of things. What cannot be discussed in words or grasped by intention does not pertain to refinement or coarseness.

**[Commentary]** It is merely nonexistence—what refinement or coarseness could there be? Words and intentions belong to existence, but what they express is nonexistence. Thus, to seek it beyond words and intentions is to enter the realm of no-words and no-intentions, and only then does one reach it.

**[Subcommentary]** What can be debated and discussed in words is the coarse principle of existing things; what can be attained by the mind’s intention is the refined subtlety of existing things. Yet what the spirit cannot express and the sage’s heart cannot fathom is the wondrous principle. To seek it beyond words and intentions—how could it be confined to the realm of refinement and coarseness?

Therefore, the conduct of the great person does not involve harming others.

**[Commentary]** The great person has no intentions but follows the movement of Heaven. With every step, they tread upon auspicious ground—how could they walk the path of harming others?

**[Subcommentary]** The great person responds to things as Heaven moves, acting without intention. Thus, they tread upon auspicious ground, speak words that benefit others, and never harm anyone. They do not excessively display benevolence and kindness.

**[Commentary]** They do no harm and do not boast of their kindness.

**[Subcommentary]** Their compassion is like the spring sun, yet they do not excessively display their benevolent actions. Their actions are not for profit.

**[Subcommentary]** They act in accordance with principle, and principle itself is free from harm.

**[Subcommentary]** They respond to the moment without confining their heart to benefiting others. They do not despise gatekeepers and servants.

**[Commentary]** They assign tasks according to ability, and the position is fitting—not because they despise them and thus place them in such roles.

**[Subcommentary]** They blend honor and disgrace, unite poverty and success, and thus do not consider guarding gates or serving as menial labor to be base. They do not contend over wealth and property.

**[Commentary]** Each is given their allotted share.

**[Subcommentary]** With few desires and contentment, they keep to their portion and do not covet, thus never contending over wealth and property. They do not excessively practice yielding and deference.

**[Commentary]** They simply act appropriately.

**[Subcommentary]** They follow their nature with humility and harmony, adapting to things without pretense, never forcing their conduct or embellishing their words with excessive deference. In their affairs, they do not rely on others.

**[Commentary]** Each is made to fulfill their own responsibilities.

**[Subcommentary]** Whether foolish or wise, they follow their nature; whether skilled or clumsy, they act according to their feelings, never borrowing from others or seeking tasks beyond their portion. They do not excessively consume through labor.

**[Commentary]** They are content with sufficiency.

**[Subcommentary]** They consume what is within their portion, being content with sufficiency, never excessively seeking or exhausting their mental and physical strength. They do not despise the greedy and corrupt.

**[Commentary]** Principle itself is free from desire.

**[Subcommentary]** They embody the profound Dao, thus having no passions or desires—not because they hypocritically value purity and despise corruption. Their conduct differs from the common.

**[Commentary]** They alone have no preferences, no aversions—this is why they differ from the common.

**[Subcommentary]** They harmonize with the world without being stained, having no preferences or aversions, yet remaining unstained amidst defilement—thus their conduct differs from the common.

They do not excessively deviate from the norm;
**[Commentary]** They follow principle and naturally differ.
**[Subcommentary]** Abiding in correctness and embodying the Dao, they do not indulge in perversity, yet greatly accord with all beings—thus they never deviate or differ.

Their actions follow the multitude;
**[Commentary]** They follow what the multitude does.
**[Subcommentary]** The perfected have no fixed intent, never insisting on their own way; thus in all their conduct, they strive to follow the multitude.

They do not despise the obsequious;
**[Commentary]** They are naturally upright.
**[Subcommentary]** Their nature is loyal and steadfast, never treading the crooked path—not because they first despise flattery and then become upright.

The world’s ranks and emoluments cannot serve as incentives, nor can punishments and disgrace serve as humiliations;
**[Commentary]** External affairs do not touch their hearts.
**[Subcommentary]** High office and generous stipends are deemed honorable by the world; execution and demotion are deemed shameful. Yet they perceive glory and decay as not pertaining to the self, and understand that success and failure have their seasons. What comes is not enough to spur them, nor what departs enough to shame them.

They know that right and wrong cannot be taken as fixed divisions, nor can the fine and the vast be taken as boundaries.
**[Commentary]** Thus they merge in profound sameness.
**[Subcommentary]** Each clings to right and wrong, so right and wrong cannot be fixed divisions; each deems itself great or small, so how can fine and vast have boundaries? This is what is meant by "heaven and earth" and "the tip of a hair."

It is said: The Dao-person is unheard of;
**[Commentary]** They let things be, and the nature of things flows freely—thus merit and fame return to things, and so they are unheard of.
**[Subcommentary]** The sage who embodies the Dao conceals brilliance and obscures traces, attributing success to things—thus no merit or fame can be heard of them. Hence the saying, "It is said."

The utmost virtue is not attained;
**[Commentary]** "Attainment" arises from loss; when nothing is lost, the name of "attainment" vanishes.
**[Subcommentary]** "Attainment" is the name for not losing. The one who reaches the ultimate level is equal in gain and loss—having nothing to lose, they also have nothing to attain. Thus the *Laozi* says, "The highest virtue is not virtuous."

The great person has no self.
**[Commentary]** They simply let things be.
**[Subcommentary]** The great sage responds to stimuli, adapting to things like water taking shape—thus they have no self.

This is the utmost of adhering to one’s portion.
**[Commentary]** Adhering to the utmost of one’s portion, they become obscure—only the utterly formless and unbounded can achieve this.
**[Subcommentary]** *Yue* means "to adhere"; *fen* means "limit." The great person benefits things, and though their paths are many, in essence, nothing precedes adhering to one’s portion. Like the eye seeing only what it can see, the ear hearing only what it can hear, knowing only what it can know, and limiting itself to its portion—this is the utmost of virtue.

The River Lord said: Beyond things, within things—where do the distinctions of noble and base arise? Where do the boundaries of small and great arise?
**[Subcommentary]** "Beyond things, within things" refers to the inner and outer of the nature of things. *Wu* means "where." The divisions of noble and base, the boundaries of small and great—do they lie within the nature of things, or beyond the portion of life? To what place do they extend?

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: Viewed through the Dao, things have no noble or base;
**[Commentary]** Each is sufficient in itself.
**[Subcommentary]** The Dao is the wondrous principle of emptiness and penetration; things are the cumbersome affairs of form and obstruction. Viewing the wondrous through the cumbersome yields great and small; viewing the cumbersome through the wondrous yields no noble or base.

Viewed through things, each deems itself noble and others base;
**[Commentary]** These trivial distinctions are what the Dao interweaves and equalizes.
**[Subcommentary]** The deluded emotions of things are inverted, confused by right and wrong. Each desires to be noble and deems others base; others likewise deem themselves noble and others base. With mutual delusion, it is called "each."

Viewed through custom, noble and base do not lie within oneself.
**[Commentary]** This is what is called inversion.
**[Subcommentary]** Glory and disgrace arise unpredictably, yet the vulgar are deluded by them. Thus what comes is deemed noble, and its attainment a blessing; what departs is deemed base, and its loss a humiliation. This is how honor and disgrace depend on external things—how can noble and base lie within oneself?

Viewed through differentiation, if you take what is great in each and deem it great, then nothing in the world is not great; if you take what is small in each and deem it small, then nothing in the world is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are like a grain of rice, and the tip of a hair like a mountain, is to view through differentiation.
**[Commentary]** What is "great" is sufficient; what is "small" is without excess. Thus, following its sufficient nature to name it great, even the tip of a hair and a mountain cannot differ in name; following its lack of excess to call it small, even heaven and earth and a grain of rice cannot differ in designation. If one does not observe differentiation through this Dao, then distinctions multiply, the minute and subtle tilt against each other, and they cannot be exhaustively examined.
**[Subcommentary]** *Cha* means "distinction." If sufficiency is taken as great, then the tip of a hair and a mountain are equally great; if lack of excess is taken as small, then heaven and earth and a grain of rice are equally small. Thus, if you take the tip of a hair as great, nothing in the world is not great; if you take heaven and earth as small, nothing in the world is not small. Though there may be a thousand distinctions and ten thousand gradations, differing in measure, when viewed thus, the principle is evident.

Viewed through function, if you take what each possesses and deem it possessing, then nothing in the world does not possess; if you take what each lacks and deem it lacking, then nothing in the world does not lack. Knowing that east and west are opposites yet cannot be without each other, the division of function is determined.
**[Commentary]** All under heaven mutually regard each other as self and other, and both self and other desire to act for themselves—this is the opposition of east and west.

Yet though self and other stand as lips and teeth, they do not act for each other—yet when the lips perish, the teeth grow cold. Thus, when the other acts for itself, its aid to me is vast indeed. This is the very principle of opposition where neither can do without the other. Therefore, if we take their self-directed action and deny its function, then all functions under heaven are nullified; if we acknowledge their mutual indispensability and affirm its function, then all functions under heaven are realized.

Now, should one forget the function of self-directed action and dwell instead on the favor of mutual aid, the more diligently such favor is pursued, the more shallow and artificial it becomes. The world loses its proper work, and human nature overflows in chaos—thus, the division of function can never be settled.

**[Commentary]** East and west differ in direction and stand in opposition, yet without east, west cannot be established—this is their mutual indispensability. If we examine the body: the eyes see, the ears hear, the hands grasp, the feet walk; the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, and hundred parts each possess their own function, all adhering to their fixed roles. How could the eyes see for the ears, or the feet walk for the hands? The function of mutual aid is thus rendered void. This is taking what each lacks and deeming it lacking—nothing in the world does not lack.

Yet if the feet cease to walk, the four limbs grow weary; if the eyes cease to see, the whole body is obstructed. Each part performs its own duty without intent to aid the other, yet the other’s function is naturally fulfilled. This is taking what each possesses and deeming it possessing—nothing in the world does not possess. Viewed thus, function exists, and each role is fixed.

Should one forget the function of self-directed action and dwell instead on the favor of mutual aid, self and other lose their nature, and right and wrong become confused—how could this align with Zhuangzi’s intent?

From the perspective of inclination: if we take what each affirms and affirm it, then nothing in the world is not affirmed; if we take what each denies and deny it, then nothing in the world is not denied. Knowing that Yao and Jie naturally oppose each other, the inclinations of their natures become evident.

**[Commentary]** All things are natural, thus nothing is not so; all things oppose each other, thus nothing is not opposed. If nothing is not opposed, then nothing is affirmed; if nothing is not so, then nothing is denied. He who affirms nothing and denies nothing is Yao; he who affirms and denies is Jie. Yet these two rulers each received their innate nature from heaven and cannot act for one another. Thus, observing Yao and Jie reveals the inclinations of all under heaven—it is evident that they cannot act for each other.

**[Commentary]** "So" means "thus." All things affirm themselves, thus nothing is not affirmed; all things oppose each other, thus nothing is not opposed. If nothing is not opposed, then nothing under heaven is affirmed; if nothing is not affirmed, then nothing under heaven is opposed. Therefore, observing the inclinations of things: if we take what each affirms and affirm it, then nothing in the world is not affirmed; if we take what each opposes and oppose it, then nothing in the world is not opposed.

The most extreme opposites under heaven are Yao and Jie. Thus, these two rulers illustrate the duality of affirmation and denial. Yao regarded non-action as right and desire as wrong; Jie regarded non-action as wrong and desire as right. Hence, it is said that Yao and Jie naturally oppose each other. From this, the inclinations and dispositions of all things under heaven can be seen.

Of old, Yao and Shun yielded and became emperors, while Zizhi yielded and perished.

**[Commentary]** Emperors of different eras, yielding and contending arose in different times. Yao, knowing the Mandate of Heaven had a successor, abdicated to Shun; Shun, knowing the dynastic succession would change, yielded to Yu. Tang and Yu were among the Five Emperors, hence it is said they "yielded and became emperors."

Zizhi was the chancellor of Yan. King Kuai was the ruler of Yan. Zizhi was the son-in-law of Su Qin. Su Qin’s younger brother, Su Dai, came from Qi to Yan and, citing the precedent of Yao yielding to Xu You, persuaded King Kuai to abdicate to Zizhi. Zizhi accepted, but the people resented his usurpation and refused to submit. After three years of chaos, King Xuan of Qi, following Su Dai’s counsel, sent troops to invade Yan. They killed King Kuai in the suburbs and executed Zizhi in the court, extinguishing the state of Yan. Was this not the consequence of emulating Yao and Shun’s yielding, bringing disaster to this extent?

Tang and Wu contended and became kings; the Duke of Bai contended and was destroyed.

**[Commentary]** Those who follow heaven and respond to the people to receive the world advance through the path of contention and yielding. Yet those who seek advancement lose the very means by which they advance—hence, they perish.

**[Commentary]** Tang of Yin overthrew Jie, and Wu of Zhou conquered Zhou, these two rulers both received the Mandate of Heaven. Thus, they brought peace to the six directions and all states came to pay homage, succeeding the Three Kings—hence it is said they "contended and became kings." Yet at times, force is required, as with Tang and Wu; at other times, yielding is called for, as with Yao and Shun. Thus, amidst endless change, one responds to circumstances without clinging to yielding or contending.

The Duke of Bai, named Sheng, was the grandson of King Ping of Chu and the son of Crown Prince Jian. King Ping, swayed by Fei Wuji’s words, took a daughter of Qin and estranged the crown prince, who fled to Zheng. There, he married a woman of Zheng and fathered Sheng. After the execution of his tutor Wu She, Wu Zixu fled to Wu, and Sheng followed, plowing with him in the fields. Later, the Chu minister Zixi welcomed Sheng back to the state and enfeoffed him at Bai, where he usurped the title of duke. Sheng, seeking vengeance for his father’s death at the hands of the people of Zheng, requested troops for retribution but was repeatedly denied. He then raised an army in rebellion. Chu sent the Viscount of Ye, Zigao, to suppress and destroy him—hence it is said the Duke of Bai "contended and was destroyed."

From this, it is clear that the rites of contention and yielding, the conduct of Yao and Jie, have their proper times—neither can be taken as constant.

**[Commentary]** Contention and yielding are the ways of martial and civil virtue. Yao and Jie represent affirmation and denial. When ordering heaven and earth, one values the civil and devalues the martial...

If one seeks to quell calamity and disorder, then the civil is devalued and the martial is prized. Thus, the Dao of civil and martial virtue has its times of honor and disgrace, just as the conduct of affirmation and denial has its moments of application and abandonment. Therefore, the rites of contention and yielding are honored in the eras of Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu, but despised in the times of Zhi and the Duke of Bai—they cannot be taken as constant.

A roof beam may batter down city walls, yet it cannot plug a rat hole: this speaks of differing implements. A fine steed like Qiji or Lüli may gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet it is no match for a wildcat in catching mice: this speaks of differing skills. The owl snatches fleas at night and discerns the tip of a hair, yet by day it stares wide-eyed and fails to see a mountain: this speaks of differing natures.

**[Commentary]** If one employs each according to its difference, then the myriad things will all find their proper place.

Thus it is said: "Why insist on affirming only what one deems right and denying all else? Why insist on order alone and reject all disorder?" This is to fail to comprehend the principles of heaven and earth and the dispositions of the myriad things.

**[Commentary]** The principles of heaven and earth and the dispositions of the myriad things take attaining the self as right and losing the self as wrong, following one’s nature as order and losing harmony as disorder. Yet things have no fixed limits, the self has no constant fit, natures differ and conveniences vary—affirmation and denial have no fixed ground. If one insists on one’s own rightness, then others cannot be wrong: this is merely knowing the self and not seeing others. Thus, from the perspective of the Dao, there is no fixed position on affirmation and denial. Entrusting them to heaven and earth, letting both proceed freely, then the diverse directions and disparate kinds will all attain their due.

**[Commentary]** "Why insist" is an expression of incompleteness. To "insist" is to follow one’s own heart. Each thing follows its own heart, stubbornly clinging to bias—taking the self as right without knowing others deem it wrong, taking the self as ordered without knowing things deem it disordered. Thus, to insist on rightness is to fail to see that one’s own position may be wrong; to insist on order is to claim one’s own state is free of disorder. How can one know that order and disorder share a common source, that affirmation and denial have no fixed ground? For order and disorder share a common source: this is the principle of heaven and earth. Affirmation and denial have no fixed ground: this is the disposition of the myriad things. To align with this truth is what is meant by "failing to comprehend."

This is like insisting on heaven without earth, or on yin without yang—its impossibility is manifest.

**[Commentary]** Heaven and earth, yin and yang, exist in mutual opposition. If there were heaven without earth, the myriad things would not come to be; if there were yin without yang, living beings would not arise. Thus, to insist on rightness without wrong, or order without disorder, is clearly unworkable. Yet to persist in such speech without ceasing is either folly or deceit.

**[Commentary]** Heaven and earth, yin and yang, arise in mutual dependence; affirmation and denial, order and disorder, each contains the other. What, then, is to be discarded?

**[Commentary]** To speak thus without restraint is either the height of ignorance or deliberate falsehood.

The abdications of the Five Emperors and the successions of the Three Dynasties each differed. Those who missed their time or defied custom were called usurpers.

**[Commentary]** The Five Emperors and the Three Kings had distinct modes of abdication. The Three Dynasties—Xia, Yin, and Zhou—had distinct modes of succession. Some passed rule within the clan, others yielded to different lineages: hence "distinct abdications." Some succeeded father to son, others seized power by force: hence "distinct successions." Some acted too soon or too late, out of step with the times; others failed to win the people’s allegiance, defying human affairs. Thus, Zhi imitated Yao and Shun to cut off his line, and the Duke of Bai emulated Tang and Wu to bring about his own destruction—such cases are called usurpation.

Those who met their time and followed custom were called men of righteousness.

**[Commentary]** The ways of weapons and yielding differ, their use has its time, and they cannot be rigidly held. Yet when Tang and Wu took up arms, or Yao and Shun yielded, they aligned above with the Dao of heaven and below with the hearts of the people—such men are called righteous.

Silent now, River Lord! How could you know the gate of honor and disgrace, the house of small and great?

**[Commentary]** What the world honors may later be despised; what is deemed great in one age may be deemed small in another. Thus, following the advance of things, one cannot but differ—this is why the Five Emperors and Three Kings did not act alike.

**[Commentary]** The River Lord has yet to grasp the principle, so the Ocean Spirit rebukes him to forget words and fall silent. Do not waste breath! For small and great have no fixed ground, honor and disgrace no fixed gate; the dispositions of things are inverted, recklessly affirmed or denied. How, then, could you trace and know the gate of honor and disgrace, the house of small and great? This is to say you do not know.

The River Lord said: "Then what should I do? What should I not do? How should I decide what to accept or reject, what to pursue or abandon? In the end, what am I to do?"

The River Lord, though he has grasped the lofty principle, has yet to reach its ultimate purport, and so he further inquires to resolve his doubts, awaiting elucidation.

"I wish to dwell amidst the human world, to nurture and guard the Dao, to cultivate and refine the Way—what should I do, and what should I not do? As for declining and accepting, advancing and retreating, and the myriad affairs of things—how should they be handled? I humbly seek your instruction, that I may follow it all my life."

The Spirit of the Northern Sea replied: "Viewed through the Dao, what is noble and what is base—this is called 'reversal and recurrence.'

**[Annotation]** The Way of noble and base turns and follows in cycles.
**[Commentary]** 'Reversal and recurrence' means turning back and forth. For noble and base arise from deluded attachment. Now, when illumined by the principle of emptiness and penetration, what is noble reverts to base, and what is base reverts to noble—hence it is called 'reversal and recurrence.'

If you cling to your will, you will be greatly at odds with the Dao.
**[Annotation]** Self-clinging obstructs harmony with the Dao.
**[Commentary]** *Er* (而) means 'you.' The one who cultivates the Dao should act with abandon, yet you cling to your will, holding fast with pride—thus you are at odds with the principle of emptiness and penetration.

What is little and what is much—this is called 'alternation and application.'
**[Annotation]** Following its portion, what is applied is without constancy.
**[Commentary]** *Xie* (谢) means 'to replace'; *shi* (施) means 'to apply.' Things may gather the little to become much, or scatter the much to become little—thus application and alternation have no fixed constancy.

If you act with singleness, you will be at variance with the Dao.
**[Annotation]** Inability to follow change leads to disharmony with the Dao.
**[Commentary]** Alternation and application, whether much or little, adapt to the moment, following the transformations of opportunity—thus they harmonize with things. If you cling to singleness in action, you will be at odds with principle.

Majestic, like a state with its ruler, it is without private virtue;
**[Annotation]** It is merely impartial and fitting.
**[Commentary]** The one who embodies the Dao appears solemn, governing the myriad things with upright reverence, serving as a model for all. The myriad states look up to a single ruler, nurturing the people without partial virtue.

Vast, like a sacrifice with its altar, it is without private blessing;
**[Annotation]** What all under heaven together seek.
**[Commentary]** *Xuanxuan* (县县) describes a distant and extended appearance. Like the people’s sacrifice to the altar of the soil, the altar bestows no private blessing upon them.

Boundless, like the four directions without end, it is without cherished domain.
**[Annotation]** Boundless, without fixed abode.
**[Commentary]** *Fanfan* (泛泛) describes a pervasive and impartial appearance. The perfected one establishes his will with universal impartiality, aiding and saving all beings with equal and boundless love. It is like the east, west, south, and north—vast and without end, measureless as empty space—how could there be quarrels over boundaries or domains?

Embracing the myriad things, who bears and shelters them?
**[Annotation]** Sheltering and protecting all beings, returning them to their proper portion and acting with impartiality—how could they be supported and sheltered with partiality?
**[Commentary]** *Huai* (怀) means 'to embrace'; *shu* (孰) means 'who.' The great sage, with boundless compassion, embraces all beings, acting with impartiality—never with partial love. Who, then, would have the mind to rescue, receive, support, or shelter them?

This is called 'without direction.'
**[Annotation]** Without direction, thus it can take the directions of things as its direction.
**[Commentary]** Like a bright mirror or a deep valley, it responds to the hundred transformations without fixed direction.

The myriad things are as one—who is short, and who is long?
**[Annotation]** None is not complete.
**[Commentary]** The myriad things differ, yet their nurturing is one. The hare and the crane differ in length, yet their natures are equally complete.

The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and life.
**[Annotation]** Death and life are but endless transformations—there is no end or beginning.
**[Commentary]** The Dao of emptiness and penetration has no end or beginning; clinging things deludedly calculate death and life. Thus the *Laozi* says: "Going before, one does not see its head; following after, one does not see its rear."

It does not rely on its completion;
**[Annotation]** Completion has no fixed place.
**[Commentary]** Things arise without direction, transcending and transforming alone—how could they depend on opposition to attain completion?

Now empty, now full, it does not abide in fixed form.
**[Annotation]** It does not take form as its abode, nor cling to it without change.
**[Commentary]** Like yin and yang, spring gives birth and autumn kills; fullness and emptiness transform, flourishing and falling follow the seasons—how could one cling to form or hold fast to name and position?

Years cannot be lifted away;
**[Annotation]** One wishes to lift them away, but cannot.
**[Commentary]** The length or brevity of years, the swiftness or slowness of time, arise from heavenly principle and do not depend on man. Thus, when they come, they cannot be lifted away to make them depart; when they depart, they cannot be stopped to make them stay. One should simply follow them—this is never not the self.

Time cannot be halted;
**[Annotation]** One wishes to halt it, but cannot.
**[Commentary]** Dissolution and growth, fullness and emptiness—at their end, they begin anew.
**[Annotation]** Transformation renews daily, never clinging to the old.
**[Commentary]** Yin dissolves and yang grows; summer is full and winter is empty. The sequence of qi cycles endlessly, ending and then beginning again. The Dao of perfect completion transforms daily, following principle without effort or intent.

This is how one speaks of the direction of great principle and discusses the principle of the myriad things.
**[Commentary]** The preceding discourse of the Spirit of the Northern Sea precisely speaks of the direction of great principle and discusses the mysterious principle of the myriad things.

Things come into being as if galloping, as if racing.
**[Annotation]** One should simply follow their use.
**[Commentary]** Arising and perishing, flowing and vanishing—ceaselessly moving, swift as racing or galloping. Thus one knows that a hundred years are but a fleeting moment—how could they be worth clinging to?

No movement without change, no time without shift.
**[Annotation]** Thus it cannot be clung to or held.
**[Commentary]** Flowing and changing, time shifting—swift as an arm’s turn, fleeting as a crack’s passage. Thus there is no movement without change, no time without shift."

What is to be done? What is not to be done? Things will naturally transform of themselves.
**[Annotation]** If one acts or refrains from acting in their midst, one disrupts their self-transformation.
**[Commentary]** The myriad things, though tangled and chaotic, all receive their nature from Heaven. At peace, they transform—each changing of itself. Why trouble oneself with deliberate choice between doing and not doing?

The River Spirit said: If this be so, then what value lies in the Dao?
**[Annotation]** Its value lies in self-transformation.
**[Commentary]** If doing and not doing were indistinguishable, then the principles of sage and commoner would be equal. Yet since one entrusts oneself to the spontaneity of transformation, why prize the supreme Dao?

The Spirit of the Northern Sea replied: One who knows the Dao must penetrate principle; one who penetrates principle must be clear about adaptability; one who is clear about adaptability does not allow things to harm oneself.
**[Annotation]** To know the Dao is to know one’s own incapacity. If one is incapable, how could one give birth to oneself? One is born naturally, and the four limbs, hundred members, five viscera, and spirit all form of themselves—without any deliberate intent after their formation.
One who penetrates this principle can cast off partial knowledge, relinquish the emotions that seek to prolong life, and ride change while responding with adaptability. Thus one does not allow externals to injure the inner self, and so remains perpetually whole.
**[Commentary]** One who knows the Dao of emptiness and penetration must also penetrate the profound reality of principle. One who penetrates the profound reality of principle must be clear about the adaptability of responding to things. Having grasped the boundlessness of adaptability and reality, one can rest in transformation and depart from contrivance. Death and life bring no change to oneself—how then could external things cause harm? This answers the River Spirit’s doubt and next clarifies the value of the supreme Dao.

One of utmost virtue cannot be burned by fire, drowned by water, harmed by cold or heat, or injured by birds or beasts.
**[Annotation]** Where the mind is at peace, danger cannot endanger; where intent is without obstruction, suffering cannot afflict.
**[Commentary]** One of utmost virtue is one who has attained the supreme Dao. Though blending light with the world and dwelling in the dust like others, one is not assailed by the four seasons or harmed by the three disasters. Having attained this within, externals cannot injure. This clarifies the value of understanding the Dao.

This does not mean one treats them lightly.
**[Annotation]** Though the mind is at peace, one does not allow them to be violated.
**[Commentary]** "Lightly" means to treat with disdain. That water and fire do not assail, and birds and beasts do not harm, arises from the mind’s peace—what injures cannot injure. Yet one neither avoids nor lightly provokes them.

It means discerning safety and danger,
**[Annotation]** Knowing they cannot be escaped.
**[Commentary]** That what injures cannot injure is precisely to discern safety and danger, to follow what cannot be escaped, and to dwell in constant ease.

Finding peace in fortune and misfortune,
**[Annotation]** Being at ease with what fate brings.
**[Commentary]** "Peace" means contentment. Misfortune is adversity; fortune is success. One of utmost virtue follows whatever comes, embodying the mandate of fortune and misfortune. Understanding that fortune and misfortune have no fixed gate, one’s joy is not in success or failure, yet one’s encounters are always at peace.

Being cautious in advance and retreat,
**[Annotation]** Discerning that advance and retreat are not one’s own.
**[Commentary]** Knowing that advance and retreat have no fixed rule, and that taking and relinquishing have their times, though one follows things in their changes, one always dwells in what is most fitting.

Nothing can harm one.
**[Annotation]** Not taking harm as harm, thus nothing can harm one.
**[Commentary]** Unified in safety and danger, obscured in fortune and misfortune, moving with transformation, thus things cannot injure. This summarizes the preceding meaning of being unharmed.

Thus it is said: Heaven is within, humans are without.
**[Annotation]** The natural is within, and what the natural follows is without. Thus the *Great Master* says: One who knows what Heaven and humans do has reached the utmost—clarifying that the distinction between inner and outer is not a matter of contrivance.
**[Commentary]** The nature of Heaven resides within the heart; what human affairs require lies in external dealings—neither is contrived. Entrusting oneself to spontaneity, thus things cannot harm.

Virtue lies in Heaven.
**[Annotation]** Indulging human knowledge leads to dissipation and loss of the original.
**[Commentary]** The beauty of utmost virtue lies in the natural. If one indulges human knowledge, the heavenly nature is dissipated.

Knowing the conduct of Heaven and humans, rooted in Heaven, abiding in attainment;
**[Annotation]** This natural knowledge acts without exceeding its bounds. Thus, though it moves externally, it is always rooted in Heaven and abides in attainment.
**[Commentary]** This is true knowledge. "Abiding" means dwelling. Acting in the world with true knowledge, though engaging with the myriad changes of things, one always takes the natural as the root, dwelling in emptiness without losing one’s nature—active yet tranquil.

Advancing and retreating, bending and stretching,
**[Annotation]** Responding to opportunities, one changes accordingly.
**[Commentary]** "Advancing and retreating" describes an unfixed manner. The perfected one responds to the world, following the rise and fall of things, now bending, now stretching—without fixed attachment. Meeting others in darkness, one adapts to the moment.

Returning to the essential and speaking of the ultimate.

Though knowledge extends to Heaven and Earth, and affairs encompass the myriad things, one never loses hold of the essential and ultimate—thus the Dao of Heaven and humanity remains whole.

**[Commentary]** Though mingling with the world of mortals, the mind remains ever serene and still, ever abiding in the pivotal essentials and returning to the root, reverting to the source. All speech arises from the ultimate emptiness; movement does not depart from tranquility, nor words from silence.

It is asked: What is Heaven? What is humanity?

**[Commentary]** As Hebo has yet to grasp the profound mystery, he raises this doubt, inquiring into the Dao of Heaven and humanity, hoping for an answer to follow.

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: "That oxen and horses have four feet is called Heaven; that a halter is placed on a horse’s head or a ring through an ox’s nose is called humanity."

**[Annotation]** In human life, can one do without yoking oxen or riding horses? And in yoking oxen or riding horses, can one do without piercing and haltering them? That oxen and horses do not refuse such piercing and haltering is because it is their inherent destiny. If it accords with Heaven’s mandate, then though it is entrusted to human affairs, its root lies in Heaven.

**[Commentary]** Now, oxen and horses receive their four legs from Heaven—this has nothing to do with human affairs, and so it is called Heaven. Restraining a horse’s head with a bridle or piercing an ox’s nose with a ring arises from human intention, and so it is called humanity. Yet that an ox’s nose may be pierced or a horse’s head haltered—who knows why it is so? There is no explaining its origin. Though the matter is entrusted to human sentiment, its principle ultimately returns to the Creator. To illustrate the unity of Heaven and humanity, he borrows the two creatures, ox and horse.

Thus it is said: Do not let humanity diminish Heaven.

**[Annotation]** Piercing and haltering are permissible, but if one overworks them, forcing their gaits beyond measure, then Heaven’s principle is extinguished.

**[Commentary]** When human affairs are added to natural endowment, then bridling and haltering are permissible. But if in piercing horses or haltering oxen one violates the workings of creation, this may be called pursuing the artificiality of human sentiment and extinguishing the natural principle of Heaven.

Do not deliberately extinguish destiny.

**[Annotation]** If one does not follow what arises spontaneously but instead acts deliberately, where then is destiny?

**[Commentary]** When one moves in accordance with one’s nature and does not exceed proper measure, then even a thousand *li* may be traversed while Heaven’s mandate remains whole. But if one spurs a slow horse to match a swift steed and drives it beyond its proper pace, this is to use human sentiment and deliberate action to destroy Heaven’s principle. Then danger and ruin will come in a day, and where will destiny be? This is not only true of horses and oxen—all things are thus.

Do not let attainment be sacrificed to fame.

**[Annotation]** What one attains has its constant allotment; to be sacrificed to fame is to exceed it.

**[Commentary]** What may be sacrificed to is boundless, but what one’s nature attains is limited. If one uses limited attainment to pursue boundless fame, then Heaven’s principle is extinguished and one’s nature and destiny are lost.

Guard it carefully and do not lose it—this is called reverting to one’s true nature.

**[Annotation]** The true lies within one’s allotted nature.

**[Commentary]** Whether foolish or wise, short-lived or long-lived, impoverished or prosperous, honored or disgraced—all are received from nature, each with its allotted portion. One must only firmly guard and hold fast, not pursuing things, attaining what lies within one’s portion without losing the Dao—this is called returning to the root, reverting to the source, recovering one’s true nature. This single phrase summarizes the profound mystery of the preceding principles.

Kui pities Xuan, Xuan pities the snake, the snake pities the wind, the wind pities the eye, the eye pities the mind.

**[Commentary]** "Pities" is the name for love and esteem. Kui is a one-footed creature, its form like a drum, its foot resembling a human foot but with the heel turned forward. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says: Within the Eastern Sea there is Mount Liubo, and on this mountain there is a beast shaped like an ox, dark in color, without horns, walking on one foot, its voice like thunder—it is called Kui. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor battled Chiyou, and used Kui’s hide to cover a drum, its sound heard for five hundred *li*. Xuan is the centipede. Kui, with few, envies many, and so pities Xuan; Xuan, having feet, envies the footless, and so pities the snake; the snake, small, envies the great, and so pities the wind; the wind, formless, admires clarity, and so pities the eye; the eye, external, admires the internal, and so pities the mind. This is to clarify that all things in Heaven and Earth receive their nature from the natural, and that clarity and obscurity, being and non-being, require no striving or envy. Released and allowed to follow their course, they naturally accord with the mysterious Dao. Those who invert the proper order, with deluded minds, vainly admire—thus he presents the futile affairs of Kui and the others to illustrate the wondrous principle of Heaven’s mechanism.

Another explanation: "Pities" means to feel sorrow for. Kui, with one foot, hops and leaps, and pities Xuan for the toil of its many feet; Xuan, having feet, walks with ease, and pities the snake for its labor without feet; the snake, having form, enjoys comfort, and pities the wind for its formlessness and obscurity; the wind, drifting freely, pities the eye for being bound by form and attachment; the eye, external and clear, pities the mind for being internal and closed off. This is to clarify that the sentiments of things are inverted, vainly arousing pity—thus he borrows Kui and the others to cure this affliction.

Kui said to Xuan: "I leap and bound on one foot—there is none so free as I. Now you deploy ten thousand feet—how do you manage?"

**[Commentary]** "Leap and bound" means to hop and skip. I hop on one foot, moving with joy—none in the world is so unburdened as I. Now you drive ten thousand feet—is this not toilsome? How is your birth uniquely different from other things? He raises this doubt to illuminate Heaven’s mechanism.

Xuan said: "It is not so."

Have you not seen one who spits? When he spews, the large droplets are like pearls, the small like mist—those that scatter and fall are beyond counting. Now you set my heavenly mechanism in motion, yet you do not know how it comes to be so.

**[Commentary]** When one spits and spews, there is truly no intent regarding size, yet the substance of large and small naturally divides. Thus the large become like pearls, the small like drifting mist; scattered and descending, their number cannot be reckoned. Now Kui’s multitude of feet are but the natural mechanism of Heaven, moving and advancing without knowing why—unintentional, they unfold of themselves, much like the spitting. Kui posed his question from the perspective of human sentiment, while the centipede answered directly from the heavenly mechanism, and the principle of *scrannel* clarity is thereby self-evident.

Xuan said to the snake: "I advance with many feet, yet I do not match you who have none—why is this?"

**[Commentary]** Kui moves slowly with many feet, while the snake moves swiftly with none; yet slowness and speed, having or lacking, are bestowed by creation. To clarify this principle, he thus raises this doubt.

The snake said: "What is set in motion by the heavenly mechanism—how can it be altered? What need have I for feet?"

**[Annotation]** When things are born, they do not know they are being born and so are born; thus in their movement, do they know they are moving and so move? Therefore feet do not know how they walk, eyes do not know how they see, the mind does not know how it knows—yet all spontaneously attain their proper state. The rhythms of slowness and speed, the discernment of keen perception—whether one is capable or not—none of these are of my doing. Yet some, desiring to possess a self, boast of their abilities, thereby opposing the heavenly mechanism and disturbing the sacred vessel. The perfected person knows the heavenly mechanism cannot be altered, and so diminishes keen perception, discards knowledge and deliberation, lets go and forgets all doing, entrusting all to spontaneous movement—thus there is no movement of the myriad things that is not free and unfettered.

**[Commentary]** The natural mechanism possesses this function of movement; slowness and speed, having or lacking, cannot be changed. Unintentional and following its course, what need is there for feet?

The snake said to the wind: "I move my spine and ribs to advance, and thus have some semblance of form. Now you rise in a great rush from the Northern Sea and in a great rush enter the Southern Sea, yet seem to have no form at all—why is this?"

**[Commentary]** *Ribs*: the sides. *Rushing*: the sound of wind, also the appearance of stirring dust. The snake, having no feet, thus moves by undulating its spine and ribs. *Semblance*: likeness. Though the snake has no feet, it possesses form; the wind has no form, yet its stirring is boundless, rushing from north to south, lashing the vast seas—formless yet forceful. Having this doubt, he thus poses this question, hoping to hear the answer that follows.

The wind said: "So it is."

"I rush from the Northern Sea to enter the Southern Sea, yet if a finger points at me, it overcomes me; if a foot treads upon me, it too overcomes me. Nevertheless, to snap great trees and topple grand halls—only I can do this. Thus, to take many small defeats as a great victory is the way of the great triumph. Only the sage is capable of such a great triumph.

**[Annotation]** To follow the natural mechanism without contention is to be among those who cannot overcome the small. Yet to ride the myriad things and steer the multitudes, allowing each to find its own place and all things to act according to their nature—then none under heaven will not roam freely. This is how the sage achieves great triumph.

**[Commentary]** Though the wind rushes from north to south, lashing the vast seas, if a hand points at it, the wind cannot break the finger; if a foot treads upon it, the wind cannot break the foot—these are small defeats. Yet when a sudden gale rises and whirls like a ram’s horn, great mansions are lifted away, and beams and pillars are shattered—this is the great triumph. It is like the man of broad vision who stirs waves amid the filth, blending the wise and foolish in the clamor of the petty, dissolving right and wrong in the dust of noise—these are the many small defeats. Yet to nurture all living things, to shape the cosmos, to match the covering and bearing of the Two Modes, to equal the illumination of the Three Luminaries—this is the great triumph. Such things are beyond the understanding of ordinary men; only the sage can achieve them.

Some write *zēng* (踏) as *zēng* (缯), meaning to tread upon a mat. This interpretation is not used here.

Confucius was traveling in Kuang when men of Song surrounded him several times over, yet he played his zither and sang without cease.

**[Commentary]** *Cease*: to stop. The character *Song* should be *Wei*, an error in transcription. Kuang was a town in Wei. Confucius, traveling from Lu to Wei, passed through the town of Kuang. Yang Hu had once raided and oppressed its people, and Confucius resembled him in appearance. Moreover, Confucius’s disciple Yan Ke had also oppressed Kuang alongside Yang Hu, and at that time was again serving as Confucius’s charioteer. The people of Kuang, seeing Confucius’s resemblance to Yang Hu and Yan Ke driving his chariot, believed Confucius was Yang Hu returned. Thus they raised troops and surrounded him. Confucius, understanding the inevitability of fate’s cycles, played his zither and sang without stopping.

Zilu entered and asked, 'Why is the Master so joyful?'

**[Commentary]** *Joyful*: delighted. With the people of Kuang surrounding them, one would expect fear and dread, yet Confucius played and sang without cease—why was this? Not grasping the sage’s mind, he thus posed this question.

Some write *yú* (娱) as *yú* (虞), meaning concern, finding it strange that the Master, though troubled, played and sang without stopping.

Confucius said, 'Come. Let me tell you.'"

I have long avoided hardship, yet cannot escape it—this is fate. I have long sought prosperity, yet cannot attain it—this is timing.

**[Annotation]** To clarify the inevitability of timing and fate, he speaks through seeking and avoiding.

**[Commentary]** *Avoid*: to shun, to resist. *Hardship*: adversity, obstruction. *Prosperity*: flourishing, success. The Master summoned Zilu to impart the ultimate truth: "I have resisted hardship, yet cannot escape it—is this not the decree of Heaven? I have long sought prosperity, yet cannot attain it—this is because the time is not ripe. Timing and fate cannot be resisted when they come, nor detained when they depart. Thus, to accept and follow them is to find harmony in all things." The Master wished to reveal this principle, so he spoke of hardship and avoidance, though in truth he harbored no such concerns. In the age of Yao and Shun, there were no suffering people—not because of wisdom’s gain. In the age of Jie and Zhou, there were no flourishing people—not because of wisdom’s loss. Such is the way of timing and circumstance.

**[Annotation]** Do not weary the mind over the question of hardship and prosperity.

**[Commentary]** In the time of Yao and Shun, the world was at peace, and people, like vessels, fulfilled their allotted roles—thus there was no hardship. In the time of Jie and Zhou, the world was in chaos, and all things lost their nature—thus there were no flourishing people. Yet this was merely the alternation of order and disorder, the work of circumstance, not the result of wisdom or folly. The fisherman who travels through water without avoiding dragons shows the courage of his trade; the hunter who travels on land without avoiding rhinoceroses and tigers shows the courage of his trade; the warrior who faces flashing blades and regards death as life shows the courage of the steadfast. To know that hardship is a matter of fate, that prosperity comes with timing, and to face great peril without fear—this is the courage of the sage.

**[Annotation]** The sage finds peace in all things.

**[Commentary]** The sage understands timing and fate, grasps hardship and prosperity, and thus remains fearless amid danger, ever at ease. This is the analogy’s conclusion. "Be at peace, Zilu—my fate is ordained. Since fate is not mine to control, there is no need for concern. One who rests in fate finds freedom in all things; thus, whether in Kuang or the beauty of Mei Li, it is no different from sitting in the Purple Ultimate Hall."

**[Commentary]** *Be at peace*: to settle, to rest. *Ordained*: allotted limits. He instructed Zilu to calm his heart: "I am bound by Heaven’s decree, with limits set by nature—not by human effort." Soon after, the armored soldiers advanced and said, "We mistook you for Yang Hu and thus surrounded you. Now that we know you are not, we beg leave to withdraw."

**[Commentary]** *Soon after*: a brief moment. Realizing that this was Confucius and not Yang Hu, the commander led his armored troops forward to apologize, acknowledging their error before lifting the siege and departing.

Gongsun Long asked Wei Mou, "In my youth, I studied the Way of the former lords; in maturity, I clarified the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I unite sameness and difference, separate hardness and whiteness; affirm the unaffirmable, approve the unapprovable..."

I have confounded the wisdom of the Hundred Schools and exhausted the eloquence of all debaters—thus I deemed myself supremely enlightened.

**[Commentary]** His surname was Gongsun, given name Long, a native of Zhao. Wei Mou was a prince of Wei, who embraced the Way and held fast to virtue, weary of the world’s defilements. The "former lords" refer to the sagely rulers Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang. "Benevolence and righteousness" are the practices of the Five Virtues. Gongsun Long, endowed with keen intelligence and vast talent for disputation, composed the *Discourse on the White Horse*, gaining renown for his dialectical brilliance. Thus he could merge difference into sameness, sever sameness into difference; render the approvable unapprovable, and the affirmable unaffirmable. He confounded the writings of all schools and silenced every tongue in debate. Born in the declining Zhou era, he stood unrivaled in his time. Disciples like Kong Chuan revered and followed him, and none in his generation could contest his preeminence. Hence he declared, "In this learning, I have attained the utmost subtlety." Yet upon encountering Zhuangzi, he was like a frog in a well. Now, having heard Zhuangzi’s words, I am struck with astonishment. I know not whether my reasoning falls short, or my understanding cannot match his. Today, I find no words to open my mouth—may I inquire into his method?

**[Commentary]** *Mouth*: here meaning speech. *Method*: the Way. Though Gongsun Long excelled in disputation, he had not yet grasped the profound emptiness of the Dao. Thus, upon hearing Zhuangzi’s words, he was startled by their strangeness, suddenly realizing the shallowness of his own learning and the depth of Zhuangzi’s discourse. It was not merely that his arguments were inferior—his very intellect and capacity could not compare. Therefore, he sealed his lips in silence.

He then sought further instruction from Prince Wei Mou. Prince Mou leaned against a peach tree, sighed deeply, looked up to the sky, and laughed, saying: "Have you alone never heard of the frog in the shallow well? It said to the sea turtle: 'How joyous I am! I leap and prance upon the well’s railing, rest in the crumbling walls of its broken bricks. When I plunge into the water, it supports my armpits and cradles my chin; when I trample through the mud, my feet sink in and my heels vanish. Looking around, I see no shrimp, crab, or tadpole that can compare to me.'

**[Commentary]** Prince Mou embodied the Dao in purity and loftiness, transcending the mundane. Recognizing Gongsun Long’s shallow disputations and discerning the profundity of Zhuangzi’s words, he sighed deeply to the heavens and laughed in scorn. He cited the parables of the frog and the turtle to illustrate the disparity between the two. *Shallow well*: a shallow pit. *Frog*: a toad. *Railing*: the well’s rim. *Broken bricks*: the well’s crumbling walls. *Heels*: the back of the feet. *Looking around*: glancing back. *Shrimp*: red worms in the well, also said to be silkworm-like creatures. *Crab*: small crabs. *Tadpoles*: toad spawn. The sea turtle, vast in form, roams the waves and dwells in the depths of the land. Yet the toad and its kin, confined to a shallow well, are small in stature and narrow in dwelling. Claiming contentment in its well, the frog scorns the sea turtle, saying: 'When I emerge, I leap upon the well’s railing; when I retreat, I rest in the crumbling walls. Swimming, the water lifts my armpits and supports my chin; wading through mud, my feet sink and my heels disappear. Looking down upon the shrimp and crabs, gazing at the tadpoles, none can rival my joy. Moreover, to monopolize the water of a single ravine and delight in the pleasures of a shallow well—this is perfection itself! Why do you not come and see for yourself?'

**[Annotation]** This is like a small bird content in its thicket.

**[Commentary]** *Monopolize*: to claim exclusively. *Come*: to visit. The frog addresses the turtle as "Master," saying: 'I alone possess the water of this ravine and find contentment in the well’s joys—nothing in the world surpasses this. Though my dwelling is humble, it suffices for my wanderings. Why do you not descend at your leisure to observe this lowly abode?' Thus, it boasts to the turtle. Yet before the sea turtle’s left foot could enter, its right knee was already constrained.

**[Annotation]** This shows that the great do not wander in the small, not out of disdain.

**[Commentary]** *Constrained*: hindered. The well is narrow, the turtle vast; the small cannot contain the great. Thus, as soon as its right knee descended, it was already impeded. Thereupon, it retreated cautiously and said to the frog: 'A distance of a thousand *li* is insufficient to measure the sea’s breadth; a height of a thousand *ren* is insufficient to fathom its depth.'

**[Commentary]** *Cautiously*: unhurriedly. A *ren* is seven feet. The turtle, its left foot unable to enter and its right knee constrained, retreated and described the sea’s vastness to the frog: 'Those who consider a thousand *li* distant cannot grasp the sea’s immensity; those who measure a thousand *ren* in height cannot plumb its depths. The sea’s depth and greatness defy human estimation—how can you mistake a shallow well for the ultimate?'

'In the time of Yu, floods came nine years out of ten, yet the waters did not increase; in the time of Tang, droughts came seven years out of eight, yet the shores did not diminish. Unchanged by the passage of time or the measure of water’s rise and fall—this, too, is the great joy of the Eastern Sea.'

**[Commentary]** *Passage of time*: brief or long. *Rise and fall*: change. In the era of Yao, floods raged, and Yu was tasked with their control, hence the reference to "Yu’s time." During those ten years, nine were marked by floods; in the eight years of Tang’s reign, seven suffered drought. Yet the drought did not diminish the shores, nor did the floods increase the waters—proof of the sea’s boundless expanse, its depth and vastness unaltered by time or tide. Such is the joy of the Eastern Sea.

At this, the frog in the shallow well was startled and dismayed, bewildered and lost.

**[Annotation]** Envious of the great, it lost itself.

**[Commentary]** *Startled*: a look of fear. *Dismayed*: a look of self-doubt. The frog, boasting of its well’s wonders and claiming none could surpass it, was suddenly confronted with the turtle’s words. Overwhelmed, it lost its composure, startled and bewildered.

Now, Gongsun Long studied the Way of the former kings, upheld the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, exhausted the wisdom of the Hundred Schools, and silenced the disputations of all mouths. Yet upon hearing Zhuangzi’s words, he was like the frog in the well encountering the sea turtle. Moreover, to claim knowledge of the boundaries of right and wrong while desiring to examine Zhuangzi’s words is like tasking a mosquito with carrying a mountain or a mayfly with fording a river—it is beyond one’s capacity.

**[Annotation]** Each thing has its proper measure; one cannot forcibly emulate what is beyond it.

**[Commentary]** *Mayfly*: a horsefly, also called *shangju* or *juqu*. Though Gongsun Long was keen of mind and sharp of wit, his knowledge was worldly, not true wisdom. To claim understanding of the boundaries of right and wrong while seeking to examine Zhuangzi’s profound words is no different from burdening a mosquito with a mountain or driving a mayfly across a river—its strength is too feeble, its wisdom too small. Thus, it cannot bear the task.

Furthermore, to claim knowledge of the ultimate subtleties of discourse while seeking only momentary advantage—is this not the frog in the shallow well?

**[Commentary]** Gongsun Long’s learning was narrow and shallow—how could he discuss the profound and subtle words of Zhuangzi?"

Only fit to debate right and wrong for the sake of momentary fame and profit—is this not the frog in the shallow well? This concludes the analogy.

Moreover, it leaps through the Yellow Springs and ascends the Great August, unbound by south or north, utterly dissolved in the four directions, submerged in the unfathomable; unbound by east or west, beginning in the Dark and Mysterious, returning to the Great Pervasion.

**[Annotation]** This speaks of its boundlessness.

**[Commentary]** *Huang*: to leap, also meaning "to reach the utmost." The Great August is Heaven. The Dark and Mysterious is the subtle origin. The Great Pervasion is nearness.

Zhuangzi’s words exhaust the subtleties of principle, ascending to the azure vault above and plumbing the Yellow Springs below, traversing the four directions and eight limits with utter freedom. This wisdom is hidden and unfathomable, immeasurable—beginning in the darkest depths and vanishing into the Way’s obscurity, returning to the world and pervading all things.

Yet you seek to examine them with rigid scrutiny, to grasp them through debate—

**[Annotation]** One who roams the boundless cannot be reached by scrutiny or debate.

This is no different from measuring Heaven with a tube or pointing to Earth with an awl—is it not petty? Begone. **[Annotation]** What is not one’s task may well be abandoned.

**[Subcommentary]** "Scrutinizing meticulously" describes the appearance of labored effort. To seek the Dao through observation or to pursue truth through debate—though one may apply oneself with such painstaking diligence—is to remain ever distant from it. It is like measuring Heaven with a tube: how could one know its vastness? Or pointing to Earth with an awl: how could one fathom its depths? Zhuangzi’s Way harmonizes with the Two Modes; Sun Long’s virtue is no greater than an awl or tube. The disparity in their wisdom and power is of this order. Since he fails to comprehend, he would do well to depart swiftly.

Moreover, have you not heard of the youths of Shouling who went to Handan to learn its gait? Before mastering the state’s skill, they lost even their native way of walking—nothing remained but to crawl home on all fours.

**[Annotation]** To imitate another is to lose both.

**[Subcommentary]** Shouling was a town in Yan. Handan was the capital of Zhao. "Youths" refers to those not yet fully grown. The people of Zhao were known for their distinctive walk, so youths from Yan traveled far to learn it. But in forsaking their nature, they failed to acquire Zhao’s skill; in mimicking others, they lost even Shouling’s original gait. Thus they had to drag themselves home, hands pressed to the ground.

If you do not leave now, you will forget your own roots and lose your own work.

**[Subcommentary]** Zhuangzi’s Way crowns the profound mystery, transcending all bounds; though Sun Long’s eloquence is vast and erudite, he remains confined within the world. Thus for Sun to study Zhuangzi’s discourse is to gain no principle at all. If you persist in longing admiration, hesitating without return, you will surely lose your own learning and forget your own steps. This is the fitting analogy.

Gongsun Long’s mouth gaped open but could not close, his tongue lifted but would not descend—then he fled in haste.

**[Subcommentary]** "Gaped" means opened. "Fled" means ran. First he heard Zhuangzi’s discourse, which surpassed the limits of hearing and sight; then he listened to Wei Mou’s words, which transcended all speech and form.

The inner distinction and outer separation were beyond Sun Long’s comprehension—thus his mouth gaped open but could not close, his tongue lifted but would not descend, leaving his spirit bewildered and his body in frantic flight.

Zhuangzi was angling in the Pu River when the King of Chu sent two great ministers ahead to say: “I would burden you with the affairs of my realm.”

**[Subcommentary]** *Pu* is the name of a river, belonging to Dong Commandery; today’s Puyang County in Pu Prefecture. The King of Chu was King Wei of Chu. Zhuangzi’s heart dwelt in nonaction, yet he cast his line in fishing. The King of Chu, knowing Zhuangzi’s worth and wisdom, wished to humble himself and make him a minister. Thus he prepared jade and silk offerings, dispatched envoys to the Pu River, and sought first to sound out his intentions: he wished to entrust the affairs within his borders to a worthy man, for the king’s duties were onerous and not without cares and burdens.

Zhuangzi, rod in hand, did not even glance back. He said: “I have heard that in Chu there is a divine tortoise, dead now for three thousand years, which the king keeps wrapped in silk and stored in a bamboo casket in the ancestral temple. Tell me: would this tortoise rather have died to leave its bones venerated, or lived to drag its tail through the mud?”

**[Subcommentary]** Tortoises possess numinous power, and when carved for divination, they can determine fortune or misfortune. The king wraps the shell in silk, covers it with a cloth, and stores it in the temple to divine matters of state—thus honoring it. The question is: would the tortoise prefer to live whole and far from harm, dragging its tail through the mire, or to have its bones carved and its name honored in the temple? Zhuangzi, penetrating deeply into this truth, turned away with disdain.

The two ministers said: “It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud.”

Zhuangzi said: “Go away. I too will drag my tail through the mud.”

**[Annotation]** Each nature has its own contentment.

**[Subcommentary]** Zhuangzi preserved his lofty and distant aspirations, prizing the carefree heart of mountains and seas. Like the pheasant in the marsh nurturing its life, or the tortoise dragging its tail through the mud, he thus bade the envoys depart swiftly, that he might preserve his nonaction.

When Huizi was prime minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to visit him.

**[Subcommentary]** Huizi’s surname was Hui, his given name Shi; he was a native of Song and served as prime minister to King Hui of Liang. Huizi was vast in knowledge and rich in learning, skilled in disputing names and analyzing principles. As he was Zhuangzi’s friend, Zhuangzi went to visit him.

Someone said to Huizi: “Zhuangzi is coming—he wants to take your place as minister.”

**[Subcommentary]** Someone from Liang, knowing Zhuangzi’s great talent and virtue and that the king would honor him, feared he might contend for the position of prime minister. Thus he told Huizi that Zhuangzi intended to replace him.

Thereupon Huizi grew alarmed and had the state searched for three days and three nights.

**[Annotation]** Mobilizing troops and marshaling forces.

**[Subcommentary]** Huizi, hearing the words of the man from Liang and taking them as truth, was seized by fear and dread, anxious about peril. Thus he mobilized troops and marshaled forces, searching the state for three days and three nights to find Zhuangzi.

Zhuangzi went to see him and said: “In the south there is a bird called the *yuanyang*—do you know it? The *yuanyang* sets out from the South Sea and flies to the North Sea; it perches only on the *wutong* tree, eats only bamboo fruit, and drinks only from sweet springs. Then a kite, having found a rotten rat, looked up as the *yuanyang* passed and cried *ha!*”

**[Subcommentary]** The *yuanyang* is of the phoenix kind, also called the “phoenix chick.” *Lianshi* is bamboo fruit. *Liquan* is a spring with a sweet taste like sweet wine. *Ha* is the sound of anger and rejection. Huizi, fearing Zhuangzi would seize his position, had mobilized troops and marshaled forces. Zhuangzi thus went to see him and set forth this parable. The phoenix is a bird of the south, an auspicious creature that responds to virtue. It perches only on the *wutong* tree, rests only by the sea, eats only bamboo fruit, and drinks only from sweet springs. The lowly kite, having found a foul rat, prides itself on its prize and looks up to screech at the phoenix. This is like Huizi, mired in glory and splendor, prizing the position of prime minister—how could he know that Zhuangzi, pure and lofty, had no desire to contend? Now do you mean to frighten me with your state of Liang?”

**[Annotation]** Things have different tastes; each has its own limit.

**[Subcommentary]** The kite takes a rotten rat as a delicacy and screeches up at the *yuanyang*; Huizi takes the prime minister’s office as glory and suspects Zhuangzi. This sums up the preceding parable.

Zhuangzi and Huizi strolled on the bridge over the Hao River.

**[Subcommentary]** The Hao is the name of a river in Zhongli Commandery of Huainan; today there is a tomb of Zhuangzi, and also the place where Zhuangzi and Huizi wandered in conversation. A stone dam spans the water to form a bridge; it is also called the bridge of the Hao River, where Zhuangzi and Huizi engaged in pure discourse.

Zhuangzi said: “The minnows swim about at ease—this is the joy of fish.”

**[Subcommentary]** *Tiao* fish are white minnows. *Congrong* describes their unhurried, carefree manner. Fish swim in water, birds nest on land—each follows its nature, and all things are carefree. Zhuangzi, deeply attuned to the feelings of things, thus knew the joy of fish.

Huizi said: “You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?”

**[Subcommentary]** Huizi, not understanding the nature of things, rashly raised a doubt: if Zhuangzi is not a fish, how can he know the joy of fish?

Zhuangzi said: “You are not me—how do you know that I do not know the joy of fish?”

**[Annotation]** This is meant to clarify the principle that one cannot know another.

You are not me, yet you can know that I am not a fish; thus I, though not a fish, can also know the joy of fish.

**[Subcommentary]** If because I am not a fish, I cannot know the joy of fish, then since you are not me, how can you know me? If you, though not me, can know me, then I, though not a fish, why can I not know the joy of fish? This turns the question back to him, leaving him without reply.

Huizi said: “I am not you, so of course I do not know you. You are certainly not a fish, so your not knowing the joy of fish is complete.”

**[Annotation]** This is abandoning the original point to engage in sophistry and press the argument. **[Subcommentary]** Hui is not Zhuangzi, thus he does not know Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi is certainly not a fish—how can he know the joy of fish? The principle that one cannot know what one does not delight in remains unharmed here; he merely seizes upon the original tenet to press his sophistic challenge.

Zhuangzi said: “Let us return to the beginning.”

**[Subcommentary]** *Xun* means “to trace.” Hui Shi’s sophistry consists of words without reason, forsaking the root to chase the branches, losing the thread of the debate. If we trace back to the source, the difficulty will naturally dissolve. The meaning of returning to the root is set forth below.

“You asked, ‘How do you know the joy of fish?’—having already known that I know it, you then asked me. I know it from the Hao River.”

**[Annotation]** Tracing back to Hui Shi’s original statement: “If not a fish, then there is no way to know it.” Now, you are not me, yet you ask, “How do you know the joy of fish?”—this shows you know that I am not a fish. If you know I am not a fish, then in fact one who knows another can thereby know the other, without needing to be that thing in order to know it. Thus, following your question “How do you know?”—you already know what I know. Yet you still ask me: I simply know it from the Hao River. Why must one enter the water? For what a creature is born to and finds peace in, heaven and earth cannot alter its place, nor yin and yang reverse its nature. Thus, knowing what land-born creatures find peace in, one may know what water-born creatures find joy in—though this hardly counts as profound.

**[Subcommentary]** “You said” refers to Zhuangzi quoting Hui’s words back to him. Hui Shi said, “You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?”—this sufficiently shows that Hui Shi, not being Zhuangzi, yet knows that Zhuangzi does not know the joy of fish. Moreover, since you, though not me, know me, and knowing me, question me—why then should I, though not a fish, not know the joy of fish, and knowing it, sigh for it? Though the natures of things differ and the conditions of water and land are distinct, one who grasps the principle embodies their feelings. Thus, strolling by the Hao River, one knows the joy of fish; observing the many kinds, need one enter the water? Here, through the two worthies Zhuangzi and Hui Shi, the great essence of debate is illustrated. *The Annotated and Subcommented Southern Florescence True Scripture*, Scroll Nineteen, concludes.

Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan

The Venerable Master of Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying’s Subcommentary
*Outer Chapters, "Perfect Joy" (Eighteenth)*

Is there in the world a perfect joy? Or is there something by which one may preserve life? [Annotation] Only when joy is forgotten does joy become complete; only when joy is complete does the body endure. Shall we say there is joy? Yet perfect joy is without delight. Shall we say there is no joy? Yet the body endures without sorrow.

[Subcommentary] This is a hypothetical question. *Zhi* (至) means "utmost," and *le* (乐) means "joy." It asks: within the realm of heaven and earth, is there an utmost joy that can nourish and preserve life? Now, what should one do? On what should one rely? What should one avoid? Where should one dwell? What should one pursue? What should one abandon? What should one delight in? What should one detest?

[Annotation] Among these eight choices, none suffices to preserve life; only by making no choice and following whatever one encounters does one attain wholeness.

[Subcommentary] *Xi* (奚) means "what." If one wishes to follow the Way of perfect joy to preserve life, what should one do? What should one rely upon? What should one avoid? Where should one dwell? What should one pursue? What should one abandon? What should one delight in? What should one detest to accord with the Way of perfect joy? This is a hypothetical question, and the answer will be made clear below.

What the world honors are wealth, nobility, longevity, and goodness; what it delights in are bodily comfort, rich flavors, fine clothing, beautiful sights, and harmonious sounds. [Subcommentary] What the world honors are nothing more than abundant wealth, exalted rank, long life, and a good reputation. What it delights in are savory flavors, splendid garments, vibrant colors, and pleasing music. Those who attain these things take them as their foundation, dwelling place, and source of joy.

What the world deems lowly are poverty, low status, early death, and evil. [Subcommentary] Poverty, humble station, premature death, and a bad reputation are considered lowly in the world. What it finds bitter are the body not attaining ease, the mouth not tasting rich flavors, the form not wearing fine clothing, the eyes not beholding beauty, and the ears not hearing music. Those who do not attain these things are greatly troubled and fearful. How foolish they are in their concern for the body!

[Annotation] Pursuing these things harms nothing if one fails to attain them, but damages one’s nature if one succeeds. Yet people now take failure as cause for sorrow—how foolish!

[Subcommentary] These things are of no benefit to people, yet the wandering world takes their absence as suffering. Not aligning with true feeling, they fall into sorrow, fear, and anxiety. In striving thus for the body, are they not utterly foolish?

The wealthy exhaust their bodies with toil, amassing wealth they cannot fully use—how external their concern for the body! [Annotation] Those who cherish the body know contentment alone. [Subcommentary] The rich and powerful labor their minds and wear out their strength, racing about to accumulate wealth, hoarding it without dispersing it—how could they ever use it all? Those who cherish the body are not like this.

The noble pass days and nights pondering good and ill—how distant their concern for the body! [Annotation] Thus, those who are intimate with the body find self-sufficiency within. [Subcommentary] Those of high rank bear heavy responsibilities and deep worries, spending days and nights deliberating what to promote and what to reject, wearing out their bodies and exhausting their minds without respite. Is their concern for the body not distant indeed?

Human life is born with sorrow, and the long-lived remain muddled, enduring long sorrow without dying—what bitterness! How far their concern for the body! [Annotation] Only by forgetting life can one forget sorrow; only by forgetting sorrow can life become joyful. Only when life is joyful does the body belong to oneself, wealth belong to oneself, and nobility belong to oneself. [Subcommentary] Those who receive the breath of life are dull and foolish, born with sorrow. Even if they live long, their spirits remain confused, enduring long sorrow without dying—how bitter! In their concern for the body, are they not distant indeed? How mistaken they are regarding perfect joy!

The resolute strive to be seen as good in the world, yet this is insufficient to preserve life. I do not know whether goodness is truly good or truly not good. If it is truly good, it is insufficient to preserve life; if it is truly not good, it suffices to preserve others. [Annotation] Goodness, when excessive, fails to bring relief. [Subcommentary] *Cheng* (诚) means "truly." The loyal and resolute forget themselves for the sake of principle, their names transmitted through past and present as exemplars of goodness. Yet it is unknown whether this goodness is real or illusory. If goodness is real, it is insufficient to preserve life; if goodness is illusory, it should not nourish the people. Relying on remonstrance to bring great peace suffices to preserve others; dying for loyalty and resolution does not suffice to preserve oneself. Thus it is said: if loyal remonstrance is not heeded, withdraw and do not contend.

[Annotation] Only the virtue of the mean is thus. [Subcommentary] *Cunxun* (蹲循) means "to comply." The way of the minister is this: if the ruler is without the Dao, one should correct him with a loyal heart. If the ruler does not heed it, one must comply and desist. If one contends against the dragon’s scales, one will suffer punishment. Thus, Wu Zixu contended and was mutilated; had he not contended, his name would not have been established. Is there truly goodness or not?

[Annotation] Thus, one should take the uncarved block as the warp. [Subcommentary] King Fuchai of Wu was dissolute and without the Dao; Wu Zixu remonstrated with loyalty and was mutilated. Had he not remonstrated, his loyal name would not have been established. Thus, whether one remonstrates or not, whether it is good or not good, cannot truly be determined.

Now, as for what the world pursues and delights in, how do I know whether this joy is truly joy or truly not joy? [Subcommentary] *Guo* (果) means "certainly." The worldly take nobility and profit as their hearts’ desire, and sights and sounds as their joy. Is this joy truly joy? Yet their inverted minds cannot be trusted.

I observe that what the world delights in—where the masses rush together—is a frantic, compelled pursuit, as if they could not stop themselves.

[Annotation] When the masses rush toward what they delight in, they do not even avoid death.

[Subcommentary] *Jingjing* describes the appearance of rushing toward death. *Yi* means "to stop." All people in the world gather in crowds, competing in pursuit; what they rejoice in—sights, sounds, and the five desires—drives them to seek until death, yet their hearts cannot rest. They all call this "joy," but to me, it is neither joy nor not-joy.

[Annotation] It is merely indulging things without restraint.

[Subcommentary] The worldly take sights and sounds as the highest joy, but Zhuangzi, embodying the Dao and forgetting desire, perceives neither joy nor its absence. Is there truly joy or not? I take non-action as true joy.

[Annotation] The joy of non-action is simply freedom from care.

[Subcommentary] Those who take sights and sounds as joy do not know whether this joy is truly joy. But as Zhuangzi sees it, emptiness and non-action are the most perfect joy. Yet this is what the world deems the greatest suffering. Thus it is said: the utmost joy is without joy, the utmost praise is without praise.

[Annotation] The worldly take clamor and splendor as joy, and flattery and praise as honor.

[Subcommentary] The worldly regard wealth, nobility, and the clamor of gold and jade as the highest joy, and use fine words and fawning praise as true honor. They see non-action, tranquility, stillness, emptiness, and simplicity as suffering. Thus we know that the utmost joy is joy without joy, and the utmost praise is praise without praise. The right and wrong of the world cannot truly be determined. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong.

[Annotation] If I practice non-action and let the world’s right and wrong take their own course, then right and wrong will each settle themselves.

[Subcommentary] Those who act with attachment cling to right and contend over wrong, but since right and wrong have no fixed basis, they cannot be determined. Non-action is emptiness and tranquility, forgetting right and forgetting wrong—thus, though there is no right or wrong, right and wrong are settled. The utmost joy preserves life, and only non-action comes close to this.

[Annotation] When the people are content, my life is nearly preserved.

[Subcommentary] *Ji* means "near." *Cun* means "to exist." The utmost joy—constant ease without sorrow—can nurture body and mind, fulfilling one’s natural lifespan. Only non-action comes close to this. Let me try to explain it: Heaven practices non-action and thus becomes clear; Earth practices non-action and thus becomes tranquil.

[Annotation] Both are clear and tranquil of themselves, not achieved through action.

Thus, when the two—Heaven and Earth—practice non-action together, the myriad things are transformed.

[Annotation] They unite without acting, and so all things are transformed. If there were intent in acting, there would be times when it would falter.

[Subcommentary] Heaven has no intention to be clear yet is naturally clear and empty; Earth has no intention to be tranquil yet is naturally still. Thus, when Heaven and Earth practice non-action, the two forces unite, rising and descending, bringing fortune and misfortune, peace and chaos, and the myriad things are transformed and born. If there were intent in acting, it could not continue. Vague and obscure, with no trace of origin. Dim and indistinct, with no form to be seen.

[Annotation] There is no form of action.

[Subcommentary] The creative transformations of the two forces arise without intention, vast and obscure, uneven and unfathomable. If one seeks their origin, none can be found; if one observes their form, no shape appears. The repetition of *mang* and *zi* is merely a variation in phrasing. The teeming myriad things all grow from non-action.

[Annotation] All grow of themselves.

[Subcommentary] *Zhizhi* describes their abundance. In spring they are born, in summer they grow—who causes this profusion? All happens of itself. Tracing their source, they arise from the planting of non-action. If they were planted by non-action, how could there be action? Thus it is said: Heaven and Earth practice non-action, yet there is nothing they do not do.

[Annotation] If there were action, there would be things left undone.

Who among men can attain non-action?

[Annotation] One who attains non-action has no joy, yet joy comes to them.

[Subcommentary] *Shu* means "who." Heaven and Earth are clear and tranquil, practicing non-action in their vastness, rising and descending, creating and transforming without ceasing. The common people, with their dull and benighted minds, cling to desires and attachments—who can attain this non-action? To say one can is the highest attainment. One who attains it aligns their power with Heaven and Earth, darkly corresponding to the utmost joy.

When Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi came to offer condolences.

[Subcommentary] Zhuangzi and Huizi shared a pure and long-standing friendship; when death occurred, it was proper to go and offer condolences. Zhuangzi was squatting with his legs spread like a winnowing basket, drumming on a basin and singing.

[Subcommentary] *Ji ju* means sitting with legs splayed like a winnowing basket. The basin was a clay or earthenware vessel. Zhuangzi understood that life and death are not two, and that sorrow and joy are one. Thus, when his wife died, he did not weep but drummed on the basin and sang, sitting with legs spread, carefree and at ease. Huizi said: "You lived with her, raised children together, grew old together. That you do not weep at her death is already excessive—yet you drum on a basin and sing. Is this not going too far?"

[Subcommentary] Living with his wife, raising children together, growing old side by side—yet when she died, he showed no grief, which is already contrary to human feeling. To add drumming and singing is going too far. Zhuangzi said: "Not so. When she first died, how could I alone not have felt grief?

[Subcommentary] *Ran* means "like this." The world rejoices in life and detests death, mourns the dead and delights in the living. Thus, when I first heard of her death, how could I alone not have felt a pang of shock and sorrow? Examining her beginning, she originally had no life. Not only did she have no life—she originally had no form. Not only did she have no form—she originally had no qi."

From nothingness came existence, a temporary convergence of elements—thus we know this body is not worth clinging to. Amidst the vast and indistinct, it transformed and gave rise to *qi*; *qi* transformed and gave rise to form; form transformed and gave rise to life. Now it transforms again into death, just as the four seasons of spring, autumn, winter, and summer follow their course.

[Subcommentary] The great Dao resides within the indistinct and nebulous, in the obscure workings of creation. There, the pure and turbid intermingle, transforming into the dual *qi* of yin and yang. The *qi* congeals and transforms into form; once form is complete, it transforms into life. From nothingness it emerges into being, transforming into life; from being it returns to nothingness, transforming into death. Life comes and death departs in an endless cycle of transformation, just as spring, autumn, winter, and summer follow one another in their seasons. Thus, the enlightened observe this and find no cause for sorrow or joy. A man lies at peace within the vast chamber of heaven and earth, yet I wail and weep after him—this is to fail to comprehend the mandate of heaven, and so I cease.

[Annotation] Trembling in ignorance, yet ceasing upon enlightenment—this is how one instructs the emotionally attached, guiding them to extend this principle and cast off their burdens.

[Subcommentary] *Yanran* describes a state of tranquil repose. The "vast chamber" refers to the space between heaven and earth. If I am to rest in death within the bounds of heaven and earth, like the passing of heat and cold, how can I follow with lamentation? Recognizing my failure to comprehend the mandate of heaven, I cease my wailing and drum upon the basin.

Zhili Shu and Gu Jieshu observed the mound of Ming Bo, the wasteland of Kunlun, and the resting place of the Yellow Emperor.

[Subcommentary] *Zhili* means "dismembered limbs," signifying the forgetting of form. *Gu Jie* means "unyielding bones," signifying the forgetting of intellect. To reveal the shallowness and deceit of the degenerate age, they are called "Shu" (uncle). *Ming* means "obscure," and *Bo* means "elder." Kunlun refers to the human body. It speaks of the profound obscurity of spirit and intellect, capable of presiding over all things; Kunlun’s mystery is distant, yet near within the human body. The unevenness of mounds and wastelands mirrors the common world, yet the Yellow Emperor, that sagely ruler, illuminates the realm, resting his mind and stilling his intellect, dwelling among the ordinary. Thus we know the profound mystery of the supreme Dao is not far—hence the two "uncles" are invoked to illustrate this meaning.

Suddenly, a willow sprouted from his left elbow, and his mind was startled and dismayed by it.

[Subcommentary] *Juejue* describes a state of alarm. The willow is a tree that grows easily, symbolizing the coffin and outer casket—this is an omen of impending death. The two "uncles" wandered Kunlun, observing transformations, when in an instant a willow sprouted from the left arm, startling him as if in aversion.

Zhili Shu asked: "Do you dislike it?"

[Subcommentary] Observing transformation together, the value lies in emptiness and forgetting. His startled alarm seemed to betray aversion.

Gu Jieshu replied: "No, why should I dislike it?"

[Subcommentary] *Wang* means "none." The principle of observing transformation lies in forgetting all attachments. If I have no true self, what is there to dislike? Life is a borrowed thing; what borrows life to live on is but dust and grime.

[Subcommentary] The convergence of the two *qi*, the five phases, the four limbs, and the hundred parts of the body—this borrowed assembly forms the body. Thus we know life is but an accumulation of dust and filth, not a true thing. Life and death are like day and night.

[Subcommentary] Taking life as day and death as night, heaven cannot be without day and night—how then can man be without life and death? Moreover, you and I observe transformation, and transformation reaches me—what then is there to dislike?

[Annotation] All this first demonstrates emotional attachment, then guides one to seek the underlying principle and cast it off. If one were to say, "I am originally without emotion, thus I am without sorrow," then those with emotions would be cut off from the vast and boundless, lost in the realm of sorrow and joy.

[Subcommentary] You and I advance together, observing transformation, and transformation reaches me—this is simply awaiting the end that must come. What is there to dislike? Having grasped the transformation of life and death, one attains perfect joy.

When Zhuangzi passed through Chu, he saw an empty skull, dry and withered in form. He struck it with his horse whip and questioned it.

"Zhuo" means to strike. "Horse whip" refers to a riding crop. When Zhuangzi traveled to Chu, he encountered a skull—hollow bone without flesh, a withered corpse without moisture. He struck it with his riding crop and questioned it, intending to illustrate the equality of the principles of life and death. Thus, he used the skull as a vessel for his allegorical dialogue.

He asked: Did you, Master, covet life and lose sight of principle, bringing this upon yourself?
[Subcommentary] Did you indulge in desires to sustain life, losing the Way, and thus meet an early death, leaving your bones like this?

Or did you suffer the misfortune of a fallen state, executed by axe or blade, bringing this upon yourself?
[Subcommentary] Or were you caught in the calamities of a ruined kingdom, slain in battle or by the executioner’s axe, leaving your remains like this?

Or did you commit unvirtuous deeds, shaming your parents, wife, and children, bringing this upon yourself?
[Subcommentary] Or did you engage in wicked or thieving acts, despised by the world and shunned by kin, bringing disgrace to your parents and shame before your wife and children, dying in such disgrace?

Or did you suffer from cold and hunger, bringing this upon yourself?
[Subcommentary] "Nei" means hunger. Or did you journey to study in a distant land, exhausting your clothing and provisions, perishing from cold and starvation?

Or did your years naturally reach this end?
[Subcommentary] "Spring and autumn" refers to one’s age. Or did you live to a ripe old age, fulfilling your allotted span, and die thus?

When the questioning ended, Zhuangzi drew the skull close and used it as a pillow.
[Subcommentary] "Zu" means to finish. "Yuan" means to draw near. At first, he struck the dry bones with his riding crop; when the dialogue concluded, he drew the skull close and rested his head upon it.

At midnight, the skull appeared to him in a dream, saying: Your words resemble those of a skilled debater. All that you mentioned are the burdens of the living—death is free of them. Would you like to hear the truth of death?
[Subcommentary] In this dream, the skull explained that all Zhuangzi had spoken of were the afflictions of the living. If he wished to discuss the Way of death, it was free of such cares. The skull asked if he, as a living man, wished to hear the words of the dead. Zhuangzi was moved by this dream in his sleep.

Zhuangzi said: Yes.
[Subcommentary] "Ran" means he assented to the skull’s offer to speak of death.

The skull said: In death, there is no ruler above, no subject below. There are no affairs of the four seasons; at ease, one takes heaven and earth as spring and autumn. Even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass it.
[Subcommentary] In death, the spirit ascends to heaven, and the flesh returns to earth. Without the burdens of the four seasons’ heat and cold, how could there be the cares of ruler and subject? Freed from the constraints of life and death, one’s years become as boundless as heaven and earth. Even the pleasure of a king enthroned cannot compare.

Zhuangzi, unconvinced, said: If I had the Controller of Fate restore your form, giving you bones, flesh, and skin, and return you to your parents, wife, children, neighbors, and acquaintances, would you desire it?
[Subcommentary] Zhuangzi, doubting the skull’s words, countered with the joys of the living. He proposed summoning the Controller of Fate to restore the skull’s flesh, reunite it with its family, and return it to its homeland—would it wish for this?

The skull frowned deeply and said: How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south to return to the toils of the human realm?
[Annotation] An old saying claims Zhuangzi delighted in death and despised life—this is mistaken. If so, what would it mean to "equalize" them? To equalize is to be at peace in life when alive and at peace in death when dead. Once the emotions of life and death are equalized, there is no need to grieve over death while living. This is Zhuangzi’s true intent.
[Subcommentary] "Deeply frowned" describes the skull’s troubled expression. Upon hearing of the Controller of Fate restoring its form and returning it to its homeland, the skull grew anxious and rejected the idea. Who would willingly endure the labors of life to abandon the joy of a king facing south?

When Yan Hui traveled east to Qi, Confucius wore a worried expression. Zigong rose from his mat and asked: May this student dare to ask—when Yan Hui travels east to Qi, why does the Master wear a worried expression?
[Subcommentary] Yan Hui journeyed from west to east, from Lu to the state of Qi, intending to teach the Way of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Qi ruler. Fearing Yan Hui might not adapt to the circumstances, Confucius showed concern. Zigong then left his seat, humbly addressing himself as "this student," and asked the reason for his Master’s worry.

Confucius said: Your question is excellent. Formerly, Guanzi spoke words I deeply admired: "A small sack cannot contain a large object; a short rope cannot draw from a deep well."
[Subcommentary] "Chu" means to contain. "Huai" means to hold. "Geng" refers to a well rope. A small vessel cannot hold a large object; a short rope cannot reach the depths of a well. These words come from Guanzi’s writings, and Confucius admired them, using them as an analogy.

Such is the case because destiny has its completion, and form has its fitting place—neither can be diminished or augmented.
[Annotation] Thus, one should simply follow them as they are.
[Subcommentary] Each person receives their destiny from heaven, with wisdom or folly already determined. Their form is shaped by transformation, with inclinations and preferences naturally suited to it. Like the duck and crane, one cannot alter their nature—thus, one should follow it without resistance.

I fear that when Yan Hui speaks to the Qi ruler of the Ways of Yao, Shun, and the Yellow Emperor, and further adds the words of Suiren and Shen Nong, the ruler will seek within himself and find nothing. Finding nothing, he will be confused; confusion in a person leads to ruin.
[Annotation] Seeking within and finding nothing, he will seek without. To abandon the inner and seek the outer—what is this if not confusion?
[Subcommentary] Yao, Shun, and the Yellow Emperor were the Five Emperors. Suiren and Shen Nong were the Three Sovereigns.

I fear that Yan Hui will expound the Ways of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Qi ruler. Yet their eras differ, their ages—one pure, one decadent—stand apart. To cling to sagely advancement without matching the moment’s conditions, the Qi ruler, hearing such grand words, will fail to grasp them. Seeking within himself, he will find no resolution. Failing resolution, enlightenment will give way to doubt; doubt will breed resentment toward one who surpasses him, and he will surely kill Yan Hui.

Have you not heard this tale? Long ago, a seabird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lu ruler welcomed it into the ancestral temple, offered it wine, performed the *Nine Shao* as music, and prepared a grand feast of the finest meats. The bird, dazed and sorrowful, dared not eat a single morsel nor drink a single cup, and died after three days. Just as the *Nine Shao* and the grand feast are fine and good, yet when applied to the seabird, they were not its proper nourishment—so too the Ways of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, lofty and distant, are not what the Qi ruler is fit to hear. This is nourishing the bird with what nourishes oneself, not with what nourishes the bird.

To nourish the bird with what nourishes the bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, roam the lake isles, float upon rivers and lakes, feed on minnows and loach, follow its flock in flight, and dwell in ease. If the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* were played across the wilds of Dongting, birds would take flight at the sound, beasts would flee, fish would dive deep, while men, hearing it, would gather round to listen. Why, then, the clamor? Fish thrive in water, yet men drown in it—their natures differ, and so do their likes and dislikes. Not only these two, but all things are thus.

Therefore, the sages of old did not impose a single ability nor demand uniform tasks. Each followed its nature. Thus, to expound the Ways of the Three Sovereigns to the Qi ruler is deeply misguided. Names must be grounded in reality, principles set to suit the proper measure—this is called "orderly attainment and sustained fortune." Reality and suitability bring order; constant accord with nature brings fortune.

Liezi was eating by the roadside when he saw a century-old skull. Brushing aside the overgrown reeds, he pointed to it and said: "Only you and I know that you have never died, never lived." Are you truly nourished? Am I truly joyful? What are the seeds of these transformations? Their number is beyond reckoning.

With water, it becomes *ji* (a water plant);
**[Commentary]** Moist qi gives birth to things, proceeding from non-being to being, thus mutually continuing one another.

At the border of water and earth, it becomes the "frog’s bridal gown" (*wa pin zhi yi*);
**[Commentary]** The "frog’s bridal gown" is green moss, which in water resembles spread cotton—commonly called the "toad’s cloak."

Born on mounds and hillocks, it becomes *ling wu*;
**[Commentary]** *Tun* means a mound. *Ling wu* is plantain grass. Once it grows on high ground, it transforms into plantain.

When *ling wu* meets *yu qi* (decaying matter),
**[Commentary]** *Yu qi* is dung and soil. When *ling wu* ages, it turns into compost.

it becomes *wu zu* (crow’s foot);
**[Commentary]** The compost further transforms to give rise to the roots of *wu zu* grass.

The roots of *wu zu* become *qi chan* (navel toad), while its leaves become butterflies.
Butterflies are *xu*;
**[Commentary]** *Jie zeng* is a kind of insect. *Xu* is the name for butterflies. Transformations are ceaseless, so the roots become *qi zeng* while the leaves become butterflies.

Transforming into an insect, it is born beneath the tortoise’s shell, its form like a shed skin, and its name is *jiu rang*.
**[Commentary]** *Jiu rang* is an insect’s name. When *xu* receives heat, it becomes this creature, its appearance like newly molted fur—elegant and cold.

After a thousand days, *jiu rang* becomes a bird called *qian yu gu*.
The foam of *qian yu gu* becomes *si mi*;
**[Commentary]** The foam from *qian yu gu* (the bird’s beak) transforms into the insect *si mi*.

*Si mi* becomes *shi yun* (fermented brew);
**[Commentary]** The wax moth in wine vats is also called *po ji* (brewing insect).

*Yi xia* arises from *shi yun*, *huang yu* from *jiu you*;
**[Commentary]** *Yu* is also an insect.

*Piao ran* is born from rotting silkworm cocoons;
**[Commentary]** *Pi fang* is an insect’s name. Rotting cocoons give rise to fireflies—or some say, to the "powder-mouse" insect.

When *yang xi* combines with *bu dan* (a kind of bamboo),
**[Commentary]** Both are plant names.

it gives birth to *qing ning*;
**[Commentary]** When *yang xi* unites with *jiu zhu* (old bamboo), it produces the insect *qing ning*.

*Qing ning* gives birth to *cheng*,
**[Commentary]** Also an insect’s name.

*cheng* gives birth to horses, and horses give birth to humans.
**[Commentary]** The source of this is unclear.

Humans, in turn, return to the *ji* (mechanism).
All things emerge from the *ji*, and all things return to the *ji*.
**[Commentary]** This speaks of one qi manifesting in myriad forms, undergoing transformations yet never truly dying or being born.
**[Commentary]** *Ji* means activation—what is called "creation and transformation." That which creates and transforms is non-being. Humans arise from non-being into being, then return to non-being. Not only humans—all things are thus. Some transform from non-sentience to sentience, others from sentience to non-sentience, some from non-sentience to non-sentience, others from sentience to sentience. Ten thousand transformations, endless and without limit. Emerging and entering the *ji*, changing forms—this is called life and death. Yet knowing that transformations are boundless, how can one delight in life or despise death? Embracing this principle is called "supreme joy."

**Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan**

**Subcommentary by Master Cheng Xuanying of the Tang, Western Florescence School**
*Outer Chapters, "Attaining Life," Chapter Nineteen*

One who attains the essence of life does not strive for what life cannot employ.
*[Note] What life cannot employ lies beyond one’s allotted portion.*

One who attains the essence of destiny does not strive for what knowledge cannot master.
*[Note] What knowledge cannot master lies beyond the bounds of destiny.*

*[Subcommentary]*
When humans are born, each possesses an inherent portion: the beauty or ugliness of form, the length or brevity of life, and all else—wealth or poverty, nobility or baseness, foolishness or wisdom, success or failure—down to the slightest degree, is nothing but destiny. Thus, the person who attains life and destiny, whose nature is luminous and clear, never demands what lies beyond their portion nor busies themselves with matters beyond their own. Whatever is bestowed by destiny in a single lifetime is beyond the reach of even the most cunning schemes.

To nourish the body, one must first rely on external things, yet there are those who possess more than enough and still fail to nourish it.
*[Note] Knowing when to stop at one’s portion, matching things to one’s life—this is sufficient. To have more is to invite harm.*
*[Subcommentary]*
"Things" refer to resources, clothing, food, and daily necessities. To sustain the body, one must first use external things, yet things have their limits and cannot be boundless. Thus, there are vulgar men who hoard more than enough yet fail to preserve their vitality—such cases exist in the world.

Life necessarily begins with form inseparable, yet there are those whose form remains intact while life perishes.
*[Note] Clinging too fiercely to form is why life is lost.*
*[Subcommentary]*
Though one possesses this fleeting life, if one cannot relinquish form and abandon cleverness, loving form too deeply, one loses the Way of preserving life entirely. Such cases exist in the world.

Life’s coming cannot be refused; its going cannot be halted.
*[Note] Since it is not within one’s control, there is no need to harbor concerns about it.*
*[Subcommentary]*
The coming and going of life and death are entrusted to the Creator. One who profoundly attains this origin harbors no aversion.

Alas! The people of the world believe that nourishing the body is sufficient to preserve life.
*[Note] Thus, the more they nourish it, the more they lose it.*
*[Subcommentary]*
The length or brevity of life, its coming or going, are not within one’s control. Yet the people of the world, failing to grasp this principle, consume abundant resources and lavishly nourish their bodies, mistakenly believing this is enough to preserve life—how deeply tragic and deluded!

Yet nourishing the body is indeed insufficient to preserve life.
*[Note] The more lavishly one nourishes it, the sooner death approaches.*
*[Subcommentary]*
Excessive nourishment of the body only hastens death, so it is definitively insufficient to preserve life.

If this is so, what in the world is worth pursuing?
*[Note] It is better to let go and follow its course.*
*[Subcommentary]*
The pursuit of external things is fundamentally for the sake of life. Since life is not preserved by nourishment, one realizes that worldly affairs are not worth pursuing.

Though they are not worth pursuing, one cannot but pursue them—such pursuits are inescapable.
*[Note] What each person naturally does lies within the bounds of the Supreme Principle, so it cannot be avoided. Thus, one who skillfully nourishes life follows and accords with it.*
*[Subcommentary]*
Matters beyond one’s portion are not worth pursuing, but matters within one’s portion cannot be avoided. Seeing with the eyes, hearing with the ears, walking with the feet, and knowing with the mind are endowed by one’s nature and principle. Though they appear as non-action, one does not strive to avoid them.

If one wishes to avoid acting for the sake of form, nothing surpasses abandoning the world. Abandoning the world means being without entanglements; being without entanglements means attaining correctness and equilibrium; attaining correctness and equilibrium means renewing life; renewing life means nearing perfection.
*[Note] "Renewing life" means daily renewal. Entrusting oneself to daily renewal, one exhausts one’s nature and destiny.*
*[Subcommentary]*
"Nearing" means exhausting; "renewing life" means daily renewal. If one wishes to act for the sake of nourishing form, nothing surpasses abandoning worldly affairs beyond one’s portion. Abandoning the world means being without cares; being without cares means uniting with the correct, true, and equitable Way; attaining equilibrium means merging with the transformations of daily renewal, thus exhausting the profound subtleties of the Way.

What affairs are worth abandoning, and what life is worth relinquishing? Abandoning affairs means the body is not wearied; relinquishing life means the essence is not depleted.
*[Note] This is why one relinquishes them.*
*[Subcommentary]*
Worldly affairs are empty and insubstantial—what is there to abandon? The course of life is illusory and hollow—what is there to relinquish? Thus, abandoning worldly affairs means the body is at ease and not wearied; relinquishing the course of life means the spirit is concentrated and not diminished.

When form is whole and essence is restored, one becomes one with Heaven.
*[Note] Both are non-action.*
*[Subcommentary]*
When form is whole and undisturbed, one preserves the completeness of Heaven’s mandate; when essence is firm and not depleted, one returns to the root and restores the origin. When form and spirit are whole and firm, one unites with the virtue of the mysterious Heaven.

Heaven and Earth are the parents of the ten thousand things.
*[Note] Without partiality, they are thus able to give birth to the ten thousand things.*
*[Subcommentary]*
The Two Modes act without intention yet transform and give birth to the ten thousand things. Thus, one who unites with the virtue of Heaven and Earth is the parent of all living beings.

When united, they form a body; when scattered, they return to the beginning.
*[Note] Wherever they are, they form; there is no fixed place.*
*[Subcommentary]*
When yin and yang intermingle, they form a body; when breath scatters and departs, it returns to the beginning before birth.

When form and essence are not depleted, this is called "the power to transform."
*[Note] To move together with transformation.*
*[Subcommentary]*
"Transform" means to shift and change. When one does not weary the form or deplete the essence, one can follow change and accord with things, moving together with them.

Refining essence upon essence, one returns to assist Heaven.
*[Note] To return and aid its naturalness.*
*[Subcommentary]*
"Assist" means to aid. To relinquish and then relinquish again is called "refining essence upon essence." Thus, one returns to the root and restores the origin, aiding the Way of naturalness.

Liezi asked Guanyin: "The perfected person moves in concealment without obstruction..."
*[Note] Their mind is empty, thus they can master the myriad realities.*
*[Subcommentary]*
The ancients addressed their teachers as "Master," a term of esteem for the virtuous.

Possessing these two meanings, this is why he is called "Master Liezi"—that is, Lie Yukou. As for Guan Yin, his surname was Yin, his given name Xi, and his courtesy name Gongdu. He served as the magistrate of Hangu Pass, hence he is called "Pass Magistrate Yin, the Perfected." Being a disciple of Laozi, he embraced the Dao and held fast to virtue, which is why Yukou consulted him.

"Obstruction" means blockage. The utmost sage harmonizes his light and conceals his brilliance, moving through the world in concealment. Mingling his traces with the dust, he is not hindered by external circumstances, thus equaling an empty chamber—void and unobstructed. The original text also writes this as "empty."

"Treading fire without being burned, moving above the myriad things without trembling."
*[Note]*
Being in perfect accord, there is nothing he cannot do; it is not that things come to him and he merely permits it.
*[Subcommentary]*
Being oblivious to cold and heat, they cannot harm him. Being one with high and low, his mind knows no fear.

"May I ask how one attains this?"
*[Subcommentary]*
This summarizes the preceding question.

Guan Yin said: "This is the preservation of pure qi, not the result of cunning, skill, or daring."
*[Subcommentary]*
That one is not harmed by external things is due to preserving the qi of pure harmony, nurturing a mind of tranquil nature to attain this—not through employing the mind’s calculations, discriminating craftiness, or reckless courage. "Lie" [here] means "to dwell."

"I will tell you."

The Subcommentary states: Commanding Yikou to sit again, I shall tell you the utmost words. Whatever has form, appearance, sound, or color is all things. How can things be distant from one another among things?

*[Annotation]*
Only those without a mind attain this alone.

Why should they suffice to reach what is prior? They are merely form.

*[Annotation]*
They are all things of form and color; they do not suffice to precede one another.

*[Subcommentary]*
Forms, appearances, sounds, and colors—all that can be seen or heard—are things. If both are things, how can they be distant? How can they suffice to arrive first? They are all sounds and colors. Only when one is neither form nor sound, transcending sight and hearing, can one surpass the realm of appearances and exist prior to the myriad things.

Thus, things originate where form does not yet exist and rest where there is no transformation.

*[Annotation]*
Ever roaming at the ultimate.

*[Subcommentary]*
Being without form or color, one becomes the creator of form and color. Being without change or transformation, one becomes the master of the transformations of the myriad things. Thus, all beings receive their forms from creation and transformation, abiding in the wondrous root of change. Those who attain this and exhaust its depths—how can things restrain them?

*[Annotation]*
The ultimate is not controlled by things.

*[Subcommentary]*
Those who grasp the deep root of creation and transformation, the wondrous root of nature, and exhaust principle to fulfill their nature—how can the myriad things of the world restrain or govern them? Thus, they come and go alone, appearing and vanishing freely, riding the upright and guiding the reins—what do they await? They will abide in the measure of no excess,

*[Annotation]*
Resting in the mandate they have received.

*[Subcommentary]*
The sage who attains the Dao abides in a mind of emptiness and tranquility, their measure vast and boundless, never stagnating in the world.

And conceal themselves in the boundless thread.

*[Annotation]*
Obscurely merging with the ceaseless renewal of transformation.

*[Subcommentary]*
The great Dao is without beginning or end, threadless and traceless. It is likened to the primordial chaos as the guiding principle. Thus, the sage conceals their mind and obscures their traces in the realm of the indistinct.

Roaming where the myriad things begin and end,

*[Annotation]*
Beginning and end are the limits of things.

*[Subcommentary]*
The beginning and end of things refer to creation and transformation. Life and death, beginning and end, are all creation and transformation. Things inherently regard beginning and end as creation and transformation. Yet the sage, abiding in the realm of nature, roams the field of creation and transformation.

Unifying their nature,

*[Annotation]*
Adornment would make it two.

*[Subcommentary]*
Moving in accordance with nature, they do not divide.

Nurturing their qi,

*[Annotation]*
Not employing the mind to control it.

*[Subcommentary]*
Exhaling and inhaling in emptiness and ease, they cherish and nourish their primal qi.

Harmonizing their virtue,

*[Annotation]*
Not allowing things to separate them from their nature.

*[Subcommentary]*
Embracing the One without departure, they constantly merge with the mysterious virtue.

To penetrate to what things originate from.

*[Annotation]*
All things originate spontaneously.

*[Subcommentary]*
What things originate from is nature. Having unified their nature and harmonized their virtue, they correspond with it. Thus, they can reach the source of the utmost Dao and penetrate the root of nature.

Those who are thus preserve their Heavenly integrity, their spirit unobstructed. How could things enter them?

*[Subcommentary]*
"Those who are thus" refers to the sages mentioned above. "Enter" means "to come from." Those who are thus preserve the Dao of nature whole and unharmed. Their minds and spirits are concentrated and luminous, never faltering. Thus, how could worldly things enter their spiritual abode?

When a drunkard falls from a carriage, though injured, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs. His spirit is whole. He is unaware of riding, unaware of falling. Life and death, terror and fear do not enter his breast. Thus, he passes through things without breaking.

*[Subcommentary]*
From here onward, there are three analogies illustrating the sage’s solitary and unburdened mind. The first is the drunkard, the second the sharp sword, and the third the flying tile—this is the first.

When a drunkard rides in a carriage and suddenly falls, even if injured, he does not die. This is because his mind is without entangling thoughts, his spirit concentrated and whole. Unaware of riding or falling, life and death do not enter him. Thus, he passes through external things without fear or harm. Even one whose wholeness is attained through wine is thus—

*[Annotation]*
Drunkenness causes him to lose what he knows; he is not naturally without a mind.

How much more so one whose wholeness is attained through Heaven?

*[Subcommentary]*
That drunkard, impaired by wine, can still attain temporary concentration and remain unharmed by things. How much more so the sage whose virtue is whole, who is obscure in the Dao of nature? Things cannot harm them, for they are obscure. The sage is concealed in Heaven, so nothing can harm them.

*[Annotation]*
Not exceeding the bounds of their nature and destiny, thus they are said to be concealed.

*[Subcommentary]*
The sage illuminates the Three Luminaries and comprehends the myriad things. Yet they conceal their brilliance and restrain their wisdom within the realm of nature. Thus, nothing can harm them.

A branch that strikes does not break the shaft of a halberd,

*[Annotation]*
Though the shaft of a halberd is used to strike, those who strike do not break it, for it is without a mind.

*[Subcommentary]*
This is the second analogy. Ganjiang and Moye were ancient fine swords. Though used to kill, and thus involved in enmity, those who seek vengeance do not resent the sword and break it, for it is without a mind. Thus, nothing harms it.

Nor does one with a vengeful heart resent a flying tile.

*[Annotation]*
A flying tile, though it may strike someone, is not resented, for it is without feeling.

*[Subcommentary]*
A flying tile that accidentally injures someone is not resented even by one with a vengeful and narrow heart, for the tile is without a mind. This is the third analogy.

Thus the world attains equilibrium.

*[Annotation]*
All disharmony arises from emotion.

Therefore, there is no chaos of war, no punishments of execution—this is the work of the Dao.

*[Annotation]*
The Dao of no-emotion is vast indeed.

*[Subcommentary]*
When the realm is at peace and distant lands are tranquil, when the wilds know no war and the court knows no execution, it is all due to this non-action of the Dao, to the sagely one without a mind. Thus it is known: the principle of no-mind is vast.

One does not hear of the Heaven of man, but opens the Heaven of Heaven.

*[Annotation]*
Knowing without deliberation is to open Heaven; responding after knowing is to open man. Thus, opening Heaven is the movement of nature; opening man is the function of knowledge.

*[Subcommentary]*
As Guo’s annotation states: knowing without deliberation is to open Heaven; responding after knowing is to open man. Thus, opening Heaven is the movement of nature; opening man is the function of knowledge. Guo has grasped it—no need for further explanation.

Opening Heaven gives birth to virtue.

*[Annotation]*
When nature moves, encountering things and being sufficient, one forgets the rest—this is the birth of virtue.

Opening man gives birth to harm.

*[Annotation]*
When knowledge is employed, one seeks from stimuli, plundering without cease—this is the birth of harm.

*[Subcommentary]*
To follow nature in movement, moving yet ever still—this is the birth of virtue. To govern the world with knowledge brings harm of the deepest kind—this is the birth of harm. As the *Laozi* says: "To govern a state with knowledge is the state’s thief; to govern a state without knowledge is the state’s virtue."

One does not weary of Heaven, nor neglect man.

*[Annotation]*
Moving by one’s natural nature, the principles of man are also preserved.

*[Subcommentary]*
To constantly employ the nature of spontaneity is not to weary of Heaven; to let knowledge illuminate things is not to neglect man.

The people nearly return to their true nature.

*[Annotation]*
What the people rest in, what gives rise to artifice, always lies in the function of knowledge, not in the movement of nature.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Nearly" means to exhaust. Following Heaven and employing man, moving by nature and using knowledge, yet Heaven and man remain undivided, the function of knowledge unchanged—thus all under heaven return to the true, and the people are without artifice.

When Confucius traveled to Chu, he emerged from a forest and saw an old hunchback catching cicadas with a pole, as if gathering them.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Hunchback" describes the old man’s bent posture. "Catching cicadas" means to capture them. "Gathering" means to pick up. When Confucius visited Chu, passing through the forest, he encountered an old man using a pole to catch cicadas, as if plucking them from the ground without missing a single one.

Confucius said: "You are skillful! Do you have a method?"
The man replied: "I do."

*[Subcommentary]*
Marveling at his skill, which had reached such perfection, Confucius asked about his technique. The man answered that he had a method.

For five or six months, I stack two pellets on the pole without dropping them, and my misses are few.

*[Annotation]*
Stacking two pellets on the pole’s tip demonstrates the steadiness of the hand. Thus, in catching cicadas, his misses are no more than a fraction.

*[Subcommentary]*
A fraction refers to the smallest measure of weight. When first learning to catch cicadas, after half a year, the hand becomes steady, and misses are few.

If I stack three without dropping them, I miss one in ten.

*[Annotation]*
The misses grow more numerous.

*[Subcommentary]*
With more time and slightly more pellets stacked, one in ten cicadas is missed.

If I stack five without dropping them, it is as if I gather them.

*[Annotation]*
Such is the perfection of steadiness that nothing is missed.

*[Subcommentary]*
Stacking five pellets on the pole’s tip without dropping any, the steadiness of intent reaches such a point that catching cicadas is like gathering them.

I position my body as if it were a withered tree stump; I hold my arm as if it were a branch of dry wood.

*[Annotation]*
The utmost in stillness.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Stump" refers to a chopped, withered tree branch. "Hold" means to use. I steady my body and mind like a withered tree, using my arm to hold the pole like a branch of dry wood—so still and steady is this that it is the utmost in motionlessness. This is what it means to have a method.

Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are many, my awareness is only of the cicada’s wings.

*[Subcommentary]*
The two forces are vast, the myriad things numerous, yet my mind and knowledge are fixed solely on the cicada’s wings. Beyond the cicada’s wings, there is no other thought.

I do not turn or shift, nor do I let the myriad things replace my focus on the cicada’s wings. How could I not succeed?

*[Annotation]*
Abandoning all else, one attains this.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Turn or shift" means to change or move. Externally, all entanglements cease; internally, the mind is still. Though the myriad things are many, they do not distract from the awareness of the cicada’s wings. Thus, the task is like gathering them—how could one not succeed?

Confucius turned to his disciples and said: "When the will is undivided, it merges with the spirit—this is what the hunchbacked old man means."

*[Subcommentary]*
When the mind and will are concentrated and undisturbed, stacking pellets to catch cicadas becomes as wondrous as the work of spirits. Thus, the Master encouraged his disciples, saying this is what the hunchbacked old man exemplifies.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: "Once I crossed the Shāngshēn Abyss, where the ferryman handled the boat as if he were a spirit."

*[Subcommentary]*
Shāngshēn is the name of an abyss, shaped like a handle, hence its name, located in the state of Song. The ferryman is one who manages crossings. "Handled" means to grasp. Yan Hui once traveled and crossed this abyss, where the ferryman maneuvered the boat with such skill and ease, as if he were a spirit. Marveling at this, Yan Hui asked the Master.

I asked him: "Can one learn to handle a boat?"
He replied: "Yes. Those skilled at swimming can do so quickly."

*[Annotation]*
Though things have their nature, they also require repeated practice to master.

Yan Hui asked: "Can one learn this?"
The reply came: "Those fond of wading and swimming, through repeated practice, can master it. Though things possess their natural capacities, some must cultivate them to become second nature. Consider the diver—he has never seen a boat yet handles it with ease."

*[Annotation]*
"Diver" refers to one who can plunge and submerge beneath the water.

*[Subcommentary]*
The annotation states: one who plunges and submerges beneath the water. "Surprised" means like a duckling. The ferryman, at home in the water, dives beneath the surface as effortlessly as a duck, thus grasping the boat. When I asked him, he did not answer me—may I inquire what this means?

Confucius said: "Those skilled at swimming can do so quickly because they forget the water."

*[Annotation]*
Through practice, it becomes as if natural.

*[Subcommentary]*
One fond of water, through repeated practice, becomes capable, his mind free of fear, forgetting the water. As for the diver who has never seen a boat yet handles it with ease—he regards the abyss as if it were a hill, the capsizing of a boat as if it were a cart rolling back on a slope.

*[Annotation]*
Seeing the abyss as a hill, he thus views the boat’s capsizing in the abyss as a cart rolling back on a slope.

*[Subcommentary]*
One fond of water, through repeated practice, comes to regard the depths as if they were dry land. Even if the boat should overturn, it is to him as a cart rolling back on a slope. Though countless situations unfold before him, none enter his mind.

*[Annotation]*
Though many overturnings occur, he does not take them to heart, for his nature is thus attuned.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Mind" here refers to his inner thoughts. As the boat advances or retreats, myriad circumstances arise before him, yet none disturb his composure. Having forgotten the water, why should he trouble his heart? Wherever he goes, he remains at ease.

*[Annotation]*
All he encounters is leisurely.

*[Subcommentary]*
Following his nature in handling the boat, moving with uncontrived spontaneity in the water, his mind unburdened—where would he not find ease? This applies not only to handling boats but to learning the Way as well: simply forget, and you attain mastery of life.

One who wagers with tiles plays skillfully; one who wagers with belt hooks grows cautious; one who wagers with gold becomes flustered.

*[Annotation]*
The greater the stake, the more the mind clings.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Wager" means to shoot for stakes. One who gambles with worthless tiles, his mind free of attachment, thus plays skillfully and hits the mark. One who gambles with belt hooks, valuing the object slightly more, fears missing and thus grows apprehensive, his aim faltering. One who gambles with gold, prizing the object highly, clings to it, his mind clouded, and so misses the mark. Thus the ferryman, through forgetting, becomes as if a spirit, while the archer, through clinging, grows confused. Clinging leads to clumsiness; forgetting leads to skill. Let this exhort all learners—take heed!

The skill is the same, yet when one clings, the weight lies outside. Wherever the external is weighted, the internal grows clumsy.

*[Annotation]*
For those who would nurture life and preserve the inner, there is nothing so essential as avoiding clinging.

*[Subcommentary]*
The archer’s mind, whether skillful or clumsy, is not inherently different—it is the weight placed on external things that causes clinging. Valuing gold highly, the mind grows clouded and clumsy. This applies not only to archery but to all things.

Tian Kaizhi visited Duke Wei of Zhou.
The Duke said: "I have heard that Zhu Shen studied as a disciple..."

**[Annotation]**
The student of the Way devotes himself to attaining harmony within. What have you, sir, learned in your travels with Zhu Shen?

**[Subcommentary]**
His surname is Tian, his given name Kaizhi—a seeker of the Dao. Zhu Shen bears the surname Zhu, his given name Shen—a man who embodies the Way. Though a descendant of the Duke of Zhou, his name remains obscure; he holds a fief in Zhou, hence his title "Wei." Having long heard of Zhu Shen’s study of the arts of nurturing life, and knowing that Tian Kaizhi had followed him as a disciple, the Duke wished to learn what teachings he had received. Thus, he posed this question, hoping to receive guidance for his own preservation.

Tian Kaizhi replied: "I stand with broom in hand, attending the gate and courtyard—what could I have learned from the Master?"

**[Subcommentary]**
Kaizhi refers to Zhu Shen as "the Master." *Jizān* (技簪) here means a broom. He says: "I hold a broom, sweeping the courtyard—how dare I presume to inquire into the Master’s teachings?" In ancient times, disciples served their teachers by performing such tasks.

Duke Wei said: "Sir Tian, do not decline. I wish to hear of this."

**[Subcommentary]**
*Rang* (让) means "to decline out of modesty." The Duke says: "I long to hear of the Way of nurturing life. Pray, instruct me—there is no need for modesty."

Kaizhi replied: "I have heard the Master say: 'One who nurtures life well is like a shepherd—he watches for those lagging behind and urges them forward with his whip.'"

**[Subcommentary]**
I have received Zhu Shen’s teaching: nurturing life is like herding sheep—one must whip the stragglers to keep the flock in harmony.

Duke Wei asked: "What does this mean?"

**[Subcommentary]**
Not yet understanding Kaizhi’s words, the Duke posed this further question.

Kaizhi replied: "In Lu there was a man named Shan Bao who dwelt in the cliffs and drank from streams, sharing no profit with the people. Though he lived to seventy, his complexion remained that of an infant. Unluckily, he encountered a starving tiger, which killed and devoured him.

There was also a man named Zhang Yi who frequented the gates of the high and mighty, running wherever favor beckoned. At forty, he died of internal heat-illness.

Bao nurtured his inner self, yet the tiger devoured his outer form; Yi nurtured his outer form, yet illness assailed his inner self. These two men both failed to whip the stragglers.

**[Commentary]**
To cling to one aspect of practice to the point of excess is to miss the harmony of balanced attainment. Whipping the stragglers means correcting what lags behind.

Confucius said: 'Do not withdraw into concealment alone; do not emerge into prominence alone; stand like a withered tree at the center.'

**[Commentary]**
To withdraw is already inward, yet to further conceal oneself is excessive withdrawal—this was Shan Bao. To emerge is already outward, yet to further display oneself is excessive emergence—this was Zhang Yi. Like a withered tree, empty of intent yet perfectly centered, one transcends both withdrawal and emergence, standing alone in the Way of the mean. Should one attain these three, one’s name will reach its utmost.

**[Commentary]**
Names arise from principles, and principles generate names. To grasp the meaning of these three sayings is to exhaust principle and fulfill one’s name. It may also be said: one who attains these three is a person who has realized the ultimate.

Those who fear the dangers of the road—if one in ten is killed, fathers and sons, brothers and kin will warn one another, mustering a strong escort before daring to venture forth. Are they not wise?

Yet what people truly ought to fear lies upon their sleeping mats and between their meals. That they fail to guard against these is their great error.

**[Commentary]**
One death in ten is enough to inspire terror; yet the harms of sensual desire lead all to the brink of death, and none refrain—this is the gravest error.

The invocator, clad in dark ceremonial robes, approaches the pen to address the pig, saying: 'Why do you hate death? I shall fatten you for three months, observe ten days of purification, and three days of fasting. I shall spread white cogon grass, place your shoulder upon the carved sacrificial platter—would you not wish this?'

But if one were to plan for the pig, one would say: 'Better to feed it husks and chaff and leave it in the pen.' Yet if one were to plan for oneself, one would choose to live with the honor of a carriage and cap, and to die with a painted coffin, a hearse, and a vaulted tomb. Planning for the pig, one rejects such things; planning for oneself, one embraces them. What is this confusion of distinctions?"

**[Commentary]**
Desire for glory leads to the loss of life—this principle holds equally for humans and beasts.

To scheme for others is to reject white cogon grass and carved platters, yet to scheme for oneself is to embrace carriages and caps, hearses and vaulted tombs—why this divergence? This is but the folly of inversion, the folly of those who have not grasped the nature of life.

Duke Huan was hunting in the marshes, with Guan Zhong driving his chariot, when he saw a ghost. The Duke grasped Guan Zhong’s hand and asked, “What do you see, Uncle Zhong?” Guan Zhong replied, “Your servant sees nothing.”

**[Commentary]**
The Duke—namely, Duke Huan by the name of Xiaobai—was hunting in the wild marshes, with Guan Yiwu driving his chariot. The Duke, seeing a ghost and seized by fear, took Guan Zhong’s hand and questioned him. Guan Zhong answered, “Your servant sees nothing.” This passage illustrates that the myriad afflictions and ailments often arise from groundless attachments.

Returning home, the Duke feigned illness and took to his bed, refusing to emerge for days.

**[Commentary]**
"Feigned illness" describes his listless demeanor, his air of melancholy. Having seen the ghost, he returned in distress, and his anxiety congealed into sickness, keeping him confined.

A gentleman of Qi named Huangzi Gao’ao said to him, “It is you who harm yourself—how could a ghost harm you?”

**[Commentary]**
Huangzi, styled Gao’ao, was a worthy man of Qi. Hearing of the Duke’s illness, he came to inquire, saying, “Your Grace’s affliction stems from your own misplaced attachments. What power has a ghost to harm you?” His words sought to dispel the Duke’s delusion with right principle.

When the qi of anger and sorrow disperses and does not return, it leads to deficiency. If it ascends but does not descend, it makes one prone to rage; if it descends but does not ascend, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. If it neither ascends nor descends but lodges in the center of the body, at the heart, it causes illness.

**[Commentary]**
When a person is enraged, turbid and perverse qi gather, causing the essence-spirit to scatter and fail to return to the body. The heart becomes depleted, the spirit impaired, and the Dao insufficient. If the perverse qi ascends but does not descend, it attacks the head, filling the mind with dread and fostering a propensity for anger. If it descends but does not ascend, yang is subdued and yin dispersed, the spirit becomes unmoored, and forgetfulness ensues. The heart is the ruler of the five viscera, the dwelling of the numinous spirit; thus, when perverse qi settles in the heart, illness arises.

Duke Huan asked, “Then are there ghosts?” The man replied, “There are. In the depths of the mire dwell the *lü*; in the waters of the Ao abide the *ji*. In the filth within doorways lurks the Thunderer. In the northeast corner beneath the wall resides Pei’a, the Deaf Leaper. In the northwest corner beneath the wall dwells Yangyang. In the waters is the Net-Semblant. On the hills are the *xing*. In the mountains is the *kui*. In the wilds wander the *panghuang*. In the marshes coils the *weiyi*.”

The Duke said, “I beg to ask—what is the form of the *weiyi*?” Huangzi replied, “The *weiyi* is as broad as a wheel hub and as long as a chariot shaft. It wears purple robes and a vermilion cap. As a creature, it abhors the sound of thunderous chariots; when it hears them, it clasps its head and stands erect. He who sees it is on the verge of hegemony.”

Duke Huan laughed heartily and said, “This is what I saw!” He then straightened his robes and cap and sat with Huangzi, and before the day was out, he was unaware that his illness had departed.

**[Commentary]**
This passage shows that when blind anxiety arises and burdens life, it stems from ignorance; when it dissipates and one’s nature is restored, it is through attaining principle.

**[Commentary]**
Hearing of the *weiyi*, the Duke’s mood lifted, and his cares dissolved. He then adjusted his robes and cap and conversed with Huangzi. Before the day was done, his spirit was at ease, and he knew not whence his illness had gone.

Ji Shengzi reared fighting cocks for the King.

**[Commentary]**
Ji, named Qingzi (also written as *Xiaozi*, read according to the character), reared gamecocks for the King of Qi to be pitted in combat. This passage illustrates that not all who grasp the natural principles of life do so by innate endowment—some achieve it through accumulated practice.

After ten days, the King asked, “Are the cocks ready?”
Ji replied, “Not yet. They remain hollow and arrogant, relying on their qi.”

**[Commentary]**
After ten days of rearing, were they fit for combat? The answer was: they still relied on pride and self-assured vigor, so they were not yet ready.

Another ten days passed, and the King asked again.
Ji replied, “Not yet. They still respond to the sight of other cocks.”

**[Commentary]**
At the sight or sound of other cocks, they still reacted like echoes or shadows.

Another ten days passed, and the King asked again.
Ji replied, “Not yet. Their gaze is still sharp, and their qi remains fierce.”

**[Commentary]**
Their glances were swift, their spirits restless, and their minds unsettled—thus, they were not yet ready.

Another ten days passed, and the King asked again.
Ji replied, “Nearly so. Though other cocks may crow, they show no change.”

**[Commentary]**
“Nearly” means perfection. Free from arrogance, their minds were calm. Though other cocks crowed, they remained unmoved. The art of rearing fighting cocks reaches its culmination here. From a distance, they resembled wooden cocks, their virtue complete. No other cock dared respond—all turned and fled.

**[Commentary]**
This passage shows that when rearing reaches perfection, one becomes invincible to external threats—how much more so in preserving one’s own wholeness?

**[Commentary]**
With spirit at ease and form composed, they appeared from afar like wooden cocks—unmoving, unshaken. Their virtue was fully realized. Other cocks, seeing them, fled in retreat. Who in the world would dare challenge them?

Confucius observed the Lü Liang cataract, where the water plunged from a height of thirty *ren*, its froth surging forty *li*, a torrent too fierce even for *dian’*ao* or fish-turtles to swim.

**[Commentary]**
Lü Liang is the name of a waterfall. Interpretations vary: some say it refers to the Yellow River’s passage through Lishi in Xihe, where it is cut off by cliffs called Lü Liang; others claim it is the Dragon Gate, two hundred *li* from Pu Prefecture, where the river cascades down as a waterfall, also called Liang; still others locate it at Lü Liang in Pengcheng County, Song. A *ren* equals eight *chi*, so thirty *ren* would be twenty-four *zhang* in height. Here, the water’s descent is described as towering, though this is likely an exaggeration for rhetorical effect.

The *dian’* resembles a *ao* but is larger in form; the *hao* is akin to a fish but has legs. This waterfall, with its towering cascade and the river’s flow constrained by the gorge’s clefts, sends surging rapids frothing thirty *li*. Even aquatic creatures cannot swim here—how then could land-dwelling beings cross? Yet Confucius saw a man swimming in it and, supposing him to be in distress and seeking death, ordered his disciples to follow the current and rescue him.

**[Commentary]**
The raging torrents and boiling surges were no place for human swimming; when Confucius suddenly saw the man, he assumed he had been swept away and was struggling, so he commanded his disciples to follow the flow and pull him to safety.

After several hundred paces, the man emerged, his hair unbound, singing as he swam beneath the embankment.

**[Commentary]**
*Tang* means "bank." At ease in the water, he let his hair loose, sang as he walked, and roamed carefree beneath the shore.

Confucius approached and questioned him: "I took you for a ghost, but on closer inspection, you are a man. May I ask—is there a Dao to treading water?"

**[Commentary]**
Unfazed by the rushing waves, the man sang as if nothing were amiss. Confucius, astonished, followed and asked: "I thought you a spirit, but you are a man. Do you have some Dao or skill for navigating deep waters?"

The man replied: "No, I have no Dao."

**[Commentary]**
He answered: "I have no special Dao—only long practice, which has become second nature."

"I began with what was familiar, grew with my nature, and fulfilled my destiny."

**[Commentary]**
I was born on land and thus became accustomed to it. Growing up in the water, I became at home there—this is my nature. Having grown accustomed to the water, my heart knows no fear; I follow my inclinations freely, aligning with the natural decree of Heaven.

"I enter with the swirl and emerge with the surge."

**[Annotation]**
To grind and spin inward is *qi*; to coil and well upward is *gu*.

**[Commentary]**
To whirl and spiral inward like a millstone’s turning is *qi*; to coil and surge outward is *gu*. At one with the water and in accord with Heaven’s decree, he moves in and out with *qi* and *gu*, untroubled.

**[Annotation]**
He follows the water, not himself.

**[Commentary]**
He yields to the water, flowing with it, never allowing personal inclination to resist or refuse. If this is how he follows the water, how much more should one follow the Dao? This is why I tread it.

**[Commentary]**
With no Dao beyond this, the principle is fully expressed.

Confucius said: "What do you mean by 'beginning with what was familiar, growing with your nature, and fulfilling your destiny'?"

**[Commentary]**
Not yet understanding, he asked for further explanation.

The man replied: "I was born on land and at ease on land—this is familiarity. I grew up in water and at ease in water—this is nature. I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—this is destiny."

**[Annotation]**
This passage speaks of how one with a particular skill, when applying it where it belongs, finds nothing in the world difficult. If one can traverse the path of life’s flux without difficulty, what could obstruct one’s way?

**[Commentary]**
These three principles were already explained above; no need for further elaboration.

Zi Qing carved wood into a *ju*, and when it was finished, those who saw it marveled as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits.

**[Annotation]**
It did not seem made by human hands.

**[Commentary]**
Zi was his surname, Qing his given name—a master carpenter of Lu. Some say *Zi* was his official title, and the *ju* was a musical instrument resembling a *jia zhong*. Others say the *ju* resembled a tiger, carved from wood. Its carving was so exquisitely skillful that it seemed not of human craft; viewers were astonished, believing it the work of gods or ghosts.

The Lord of Lu saw it and asked: "What technique did you use to make it?"

**[Commentary]**
The Lord of Lu, struck by its divine craftsmanship, asked in wonder: "What Dao did you employ to create this *ju*?"

He replied: "I am but a craftsman—what technique could I possess? Though, there is one thing..."

When I set about crafting the *ju*, I never dared to expend my qi, but always purified myself to still my mind.

**[Annotation]**
Master Zi replied: "I am but a humble craftsman—what art could I possess? Yet there is one method. When I prepare to carve, I never allow distraction or dissipation of my spirit and qi, but instead fast and purify myself to quiet my mind and spirit."

After three days of purification, I dared not entertain thoughts of reward or rank;

**[Annotation]**
Once my mind was aligned, after nearly three days, matters such as celebrations, mourning, punishments, rewards, official titles, or profit no longer entered my thoughts.

After five days, I dared not entertain thoughts of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness;

**[Annotation]**
As the days of purification lengthened, my spirit gradually stilled, allowing me to cast aside both praise and blame, skill and clumsiness alike.

After seven days, I would suddenly forget I possessed four limbs or a physical form. At that time, I had no awareness of court or state,

**[Annotation]**
"Suddenly" here means without deliberate movement. After prolonged purification, my emotions and attachments became pure and empty, so that my entire body and limbs were forgotten at once, motionless as withered wood. With no thought of public or private affairs, how could I harbor concern for the court?

**[Annotation]**
Matters external to one’s nature fall away.

**[Annotation]**
*Slippery*—here meaning disorder. With my mind wholly concentrated on inner skill, external distractions dissolved.

Only then did I enter the mountain forests to observe the natural patterns of things.

When the physical form reaches its utmost perfection, only then does one perceive the crucible, only then does one apply the hand—otherwise, one desists.

**[Annotation]**
The hexagram draws from what lies within the village.

**[Annotation]**
With external affairs dissolved and the inner mind emptied and still, one enters the mountain forests to observe the natural dispositions of fine trees. When the form and appearance of a tree attain the most exquisite refinement, and its substance proves worthy of refinement, only then does one proceed to work upon it. If not, one ceases and does nothing.

Thus, the work accords with Heaven by means of Heaven.

**[Annotation]**
It does not depart from its natural state.

**[Annotation]**
Though human skill introduces ingenuity, the nature of the wood remains rooted in the natural, hence it accords with Heaven.

That which makes the vessel seem divine is precisely this.

**[Annotation]**
It fully follows the marvel of the thing itself, so that it appears as if wrought by spirits.

**[Annotation]**
The reason it seems so subtly wondrous as to resemble the work of spirits is simply that it follows the natural disposition, yielding to spontaneity—thus achieving such excellence.

This chapter shows that following principle makes skill as effortless as the work of spirits, while defying nature labors the mind and leads to clumsiness.

Dongye Ji presented his charioteering to Duke Zhuang of Lu, advancing and retreating in perfect alignment with the marking line, turning left and right in perfect arcs. The Duke thought even embroidered patterns could not surpass it.

**[Annotation]**
Dongye was his surname, Ji his given name—an expert charioteer of old who demonstrated his skill to Duke Zhuang of Lu. His left and right turns formed perfect circles, his advances and retreats traced the straightness of the marking line. The Duke believed even the finest woven patterns could not match such mastery.

He had him execute a hundred hook-turns and return.

**[Annotation]**
Guiding the horses in curved turns like hooks, he completed a hundred reversals, each retracing its path.

Yan He encountered him and entered to say, "Ji’s horses will fail." The Duke remained silent and did not respond.

**[Annotation]**
Yan was his surname, He his given name—a worthy man of Lu who entered to speak. The Duke did not believe him at first, so he remained silent and did not reply.

Soon after, the horses indeed faltered and returned. The Duke asked, "How did you know?"

**[Annotation]**
After a short while, the horses exhausted themselves and failed. The Duke asked Yan how he had foreseen this.

He replied, "His horses’ strength was spent, yet he still demanded more—hence I said they would fail."

**[Annotation]**
This illustrates the impossibility of exceeding what is perfectly fitting.

**[Annotation]**
He answered: The horses’ strength was exhausted, yet he sought to push them beyond their capacity—thus I knew they would fail.

Not only chariots and horses—all things are so. The craftsman’s hammer turns in accord with compass and square, his fingers transform with the material without mental hesitation.

**[Annotation]**
"Turns" refers to the compass; "compass" to the circle. "Hesitation" means delay. Even a craftsman of Yao’s time, endowed with the utmost skill, would wield compass and square, his hands moving in harmony with the material, applying skill as the thing required, without hesitation.

Thus his spirit-terrace remains unstrained.

**[Annotation]**
Though the craftsman’s skill is entrusted to his hands, he still relies on compass and square—this speaks of yielding to what is easy in the thing itself.

**[Annotation]**
Entrusting oneself to things and following their course, one’s mind becomes empty and serene—thus the spirit-terrace congeals in unity without constraint.

One forgets the feet, for the shoes fit perfectly;
One forgets the waist, for the belt fits perfectly.

**[Annotation]**
When every part of the body is at ease, one forgets the body entirely.

One forgets right and wrong, for the mind is perfectly at ease.

**[Annotation]**
Right and wrong arise from dis-ease.

**[Annotation]**
Shoes and belts exist for the feet and waist—yet when one forgets feet and waist, shoes and belt feel perfectly fitting. Likewise, the mind harbors sorrow and vexation because of right and wrong—yet when one knows to forget right and wrong, the mind remains perpetually at ease.

Without inner disturbance or outer compliance, one attains the perfect ease of things meeting as they should.

**[Annotation]**
One rests in what one encounters, thus there is nothing to alter or follow.

**[Annotation]**
With external knowledge stilled and the inner mind unmoved by things, the realm becomes empty—one does not follow affairs but instead aligns with the true Way, ever at ease in every situation.

From the outset, one is at ease and never not at ease—this is the ease of forgetting ease.

**[Annotation]**
One who recognizes ease is not yet at ease.

**[Annotation]**
"From the outset" means fundamentally. One who embodies the Way in emptiness and forgetfulness is fundamentally at ease—not made joyful by external things, nor at times dis-eased. Fundamentally at ease, there is no moment without joy. This is the ease of forgetting ease, not the ease of deliberate seeking.

There was a man named Sun Xiu.

**[Annotation]**
His surname was Sun, his given name Xiu—a man of Lu.

He came to the gate and lamented to Master Bian Qingzi, saying: "In my village, I am not regarded as cultivated; in times of peril, I am not regarded as brave. Yet when I till the fields, I do not meet with good years; when I serve my lord, I do not meet with a worthy age. I am shunned in my village, banished from my district—what offense have I committed against Heaven? Why must I suffer such fate?"

**[Annotation]**
"Came to the gate" means he approached repeatedly. "Lamented" means he spoke with grievance, complaining of his misfortune rather than blaming his lack of understanding. Bian was his surname, Qingzi his given name—a worthy man of Lu and Sun Xiu’s teacher. Sun Xiu, a worldly man who did not grasp the Mandate of Heaven, came repeatedly to the gate and said: "In my village, no one says I lack refinement; in times of danger, no one says I lack courage. Yet when I farm the plains, I encounter barren years and no harvest; when I serve at court, I do not meet with a sagely ruler and fine office. I am exiled from my district and cast out by my village—what sin have I committed against Heaven that I must endure such fate?"

Master Bian said: "Have you not heard of the self-conduct of the perfected person? He forgets his liver and gall, abandons his ears and eyes."

**[Annotation]**
He merges with spontaneity.

**[Annotation]**
The perfected person’s conduct is lofty, empty, and pure—thus he inwardly forgets the liver and gall among the five viscera, outwardly abandons the ears and eyes among the six senses. Empty and still, nothing lingers in his breast.

Vague and drifting beyond the dust and grime...

The [Annotation] states: All such true nature is but dust and grime.
Carefree in the work of no-affair—
[Annotation] All self-directed action is the work of no-affair.

[Subcommentary] "Vague and drifting" describes a state of no-mind. "Wandering" is the name for unbridled freedom; "carefree" is the term for following one’s inclination. Yet though he dwells amid defilement, he is not defiled; though he roams beyond the clamor of the world, he acts without acting amid worldly affairs. This is called "acting without relying,"
[Annotation] He follows his nature and acts spontaneously—not relying on anything to act.
"growing without controlling."
[Annotation] He lets things grow of themselves—not controlling them to make them grow.

[Subcommentary] In engaging with things and bestowing transformation, he does not rely on his own toil; in nurturing the common people, how could he sever or shape them to his will? This passage comes from the *Lao Canon*.

Now you adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate your person to expose others’ filth—shining bright as though carrying the sun and moon in your stride.
[Subcommentary] You embellish your mind’s cleverness to astonish the vulgar; you groom your body to highlight others’ impurities. Brilliant and clear, you flaunt your abilities, striding through the world as if bearing the sun and moon—how is this concealing your light or hiding your brilliance to nurture tranquility?

You have preserved your bodily form intact, your nine orifices complete—never cut down midway by deafness, blindness, lameness, or disability to be counted among the ranks of men. This is already good fortune; why then do you have leisure to resent Heaven?
Go now.
[Subcommentary] And—you—have kept your body and appearance whole, your nine orifices unimpaired, and further avoided being stricken midway by deafness, blindness, lameness, or disability, thus gaining a place among human kind and numbering among men. What greater blessing could there be? How could you find time to resent the Way of Heaven? You should go at once; spare me further words.

Sunzi departed. Master Bian entered, sat, and after a moment looked up to the sky and sighed.
[Subcommentary] Sun Xiu heard the Way and left; Master Bian finished speaking and returned. In that brief interval, he sighed in lament.

A disciple asked: Why do you sigh, Master?
[Subcommentary] Master Bian’s disciples asked the reason for his lament.

Master Bian said: Just now Xiu came, and I told him of the virtue of the perfected person. I fear he was startled and may fall into confusion.
[Subcommentary] Sun Xiu repeatedly came to my door in distress, bewildered by the hardships of life, stumbling and unbalanced. I then told him of the profound and mysterious virtue of the perfected person. But his capacity is small and my words were great—I worried the revelation might overwhelm him, deepening his confusion, and so I sighed in concern.

The disciple said: Not so. Was what Sunzi said correct?

Was what you said incorrect, Master? For if it were not so, it could not have confused him. What Sunzi spoke was ancient truth. Was it incorrect? Or was what you said correct? He came already confused, so what fault is his?

[Subcommentary] If Sunzi were to assert correctness and dismiss the Master’s words as wrong, then false speech would never confuse the true. If the Master’s words were correct and Sunzi’s wrong, then his confusion would have brought him here seeking truth. Examining the matter from both sides, what fault could there be? Yet the Master’s initial concern proved ultimately unfounded.

Master Bian said: Not so. Once there was a crow that alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu delighted in it and prepared a grand sacrificial feast to honor it, performing the Nine Shao to entertain it. The crow then grew anxious, sorrowful, and dizzy, refusing to eat or drink. This is what is meant by nourishing a crow with what nourishes oneself. As for nourishing a crow with what nourishes crows, one should let it roost in deep forests, drift upon rivers and lakes, and feed upon creeping vines—then it would be at ease upon the open plain.

[Annotation] Each has what suits it.

[Subcommentary] This solitary crow was no auspicious omen, yet the Lord of Lu lavished praise upon it, honoring it with a grand feast. The matter was already explained in the preceding chapter, so there is no need for further elaboration. Now, Sun Xiu is a man of limited understanding and narrow experience. When I told him of the virtue of the perfected person, it was like transporting a field mouse in a carriage or entertaining a sparrow with court music. How could he not have been startled?

[Annotation] This chapter shows that those who skillfully nourish life each follow what is fitting to their nature and thereby attain the Way.

[Subcommentary] The *ji* is a small mouse; the *ma* is a sparrow. Sun Xiu is a man of little knowledge and scant experience, requiring gradual and careful instruction. Yet I told him of the virtue of the perfected person—words of profound and mysterious Dao. How is this different from carrying a small mouse in a great carriage or delighting a sparrow with the music of Shao? Using what is great to guide what is small, how could he not have been frightened?

*End of Zhuangzi: Annotated Explanations, Scroll Twenty-One*

Master Cheng Xuanying of the Tang, *Subcommentary on the Outer Chapters: "Mountain Trees" (Chapter Twenty)*

When Zhuangzi was traveling through the mountains, he saw a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. Asking the reason, Zhuangzi was told: “It is of no use.” Zhuangzi said: “This tree, by being of no use, has attained the full span of its natural years.”

[Subcommentary] Like the tree on the winding path or the timber of Shangqiu, it was of no use as lumber, and so it completed its natural lifespan.

The Master emerged from the mountains and lodged at the home of an old friend.

[Subcommentary] *She* means to rest. The disciples addressed Zhuangzi as “the Master.”

The old friend was delighted and ordered his servant boy to kill a goose and cook it.

[Subcommentary] The servant boy was a young attendant. The boy asked: “One can caw, the other cannot. Which should we kill?” The host replied: “Kill the one that cannot caw.”

The next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi: “Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by being of no use, attained the full span of its natural years. Today, our host’s goose, by being of no use, has died. Where will you, Master, take your place?” Zhuangzi laughed and said: “I will take my place between being of use and being of no use.”

Between being of use and being of no use—this seems like it, yet is not. Therefore, one is not yet free from entanglement.

[Annotation] He would take his place here, but even this is not free from entanglement, so in the end, he does not take it.

[Subcommentary] To be of use is to act; to be of no use is to be without action. Between them lies the middle Way. Though one may depart from these two extremes and abide in this middle unity, since the middle has not yet been transcended, one remains unable to govern others as a person or to merge with them as a horse. Thus, it seems like the Way but is not the true Way, and one still suffers entanglement.

If, however, one rides the virtue of the Dao and floats freely, it is not so.

[Subcommentary] One who rides the mysterious Dao and perfect virtue to float freely in the world does not follow this path. Having transcended the two extremes and forgotten the middle unity, one can empty and penetrate, floating freely through the ages.

Without praise, without blame, now a dragon, now a snake—

[Annotation] *Zi* means slander. The dragon emerges; the snake withdraws. The Dao is neither of use nor of no use, so the distinctions of praise and blame are both lost.

Transforming with the times—

[Subcommentary] This is the transcendence of the middle.

Having transcended the two extremes and forgotten the middle unity—transcending yet again, profound beyond profundity—

Yet without clinging to any fixed form;

[Subcommentary] Having exquisitely transcended the middle unity and surpassed the four propositions, how could one still be swayed by flattery or slander, or deluded by the emergence of the dragon or the withdrawal of the snake? Thus, one drifts with the world’s vicissitudes, transforming with the times—how could one remain partial or stagnant, fixated on a single thing?

Now rising, now descending, taking harmony as the measure,

[Subcommentary] The perfected person follows the times in ascent and descent, taking harmony as the common standard.

Floating freely in the origin of the ten thousand things;

[Subcommentary] With great harmony and impartial weight, one roams the ancestral source of creation.

Treating things as things yet not being objectified by things—how then could one be entangled?

[Subcommentary] When things do not objectify one another, there is no care or hindrance.

This is the model of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor.

[Annotation] Thus, Zhuangzi also abided by it.

[Subcommentary] As Guo’s annotation states: "Thus, Zhuangzi also abided by it."

As for the nature of the ten thousand things and the transmission of human relations, it is not so.

[Subcommentary] *Lun* means principle.

Following the common customs and transmitted practices, it does not compare to the former.

Union leads to separation; completion leads to destruction;
Integrity invites injury; honor invites disgrace,

[Subcommentary] Union is followed by separation; completion is followed by destruction. Purity invites harm; honor invites suspicion.

The world’s conditions are treacherous and uneven—how could one cling stubbornly?

Moreover, purity harms others, and others cannot endure transformation, thus inviting injury in return.
Self-importance over possessions invites humiliation, and others cannot endure disgrace, thus inviting suspicion in return.

Action incurs loss; worth invites schemes,

[Subcommentary] *Kui* means depletion—action incurs depletion.
Worth, with its lofty aspirations, becomes the target of others’ schemes.

Inferiority invites deceit—how could one be certain of anything?

[Subcommentary] Whether one is worthy or unworthy, what is the use of such distinctions? Clinging to them leads to partiality and fixation on names and measures, resulting in completion and depletion.

Alas!

Disciples, take heed of this.

Alas! Such is the sound of lamentation.
*Zhi* means to remember.
Is there not the realm of virtue and the Dao?

[Annotation] One cannot cling, and thus cannot rely on a single method—only those who transform with the times can traverse change and remain perpetually unobstructed.

[Subcommentary] To apply the principle of impartial equilibrium—is this not the realm of virtue and the Dao?

Shi Nanyi Liaoyao of the Southern Market met with the Lord of Lu,

[Subcommentary] His surname was Xiong, given name Yiliao, and he lived in reclusion in the southern market.

and the Lord of Lu wore a troubled expression.
Master of the Southern Market asked: "My lord bears a troubled countenance—why is this?"
The Lord of Lu replied: "I study the Dao of the former kings and cultivate the legacy of my predecessors. I revere the spirits and honor the worthy,

[Subcommentary] The former kings refer to King Ji and King Wen; the predecessors refer to the Duke of Zhou and Bo Qin.

and I practice these things with devotion, never departing from them for even a moment.

[Subcommentary] *Li* means dispersion; *ju* means tranquil abiding.

Yet I have not escaped misfortune—this is why I am troubled."
The Master of the Southern Market said: "My lord’s method for eliminating misfortune is shallow indeed.

[Annotation] Clinging to one’s person while prizing one’s state, though one’s concerns be manifold and one’s reverence for the worthy and practice of virtue be earnest, one’s anxieties only deepen.

[Subcommentary] The method of revering spirits and honoring the worthy has not yet eliminated misfortune.

Consider the plump fox and the patterned leopard,

[Subcommentary] *Feng* means great. With their rich markings and lustrous fur, they are prized by men.

who dwell in the mountains and forests, nest in caves and hollows—this is stillness.
They move by night and rest by day—this is vigilance.
Though hunger and thirst press upon them, they still roam the rivers and lakes in search of food—

[Subcommentary] *Jie* means caution; *yinyue* means deliberation. *Dan* means dawn; *xu* means all. Though starving and parched, they deliberate until the break of day when no one is about, then together venture onto the rivers and lakes, weaving through the grasses to seek sustenance.

this is resolve.
Yet even so, they do not escape the perils of nets, snares, and traps."

What crime have they committed? It is their very hides that bring them disaster.

[Subcommentary] *Jibi* refers to snares and traps. Though they deliberate and settle their plans thus, they still cannot escape being captured and killed—this arises from no other fault but the peril of their patterned pelts. Is the state of Lu alone not your hide, my lord? I wish that you would carve away your form and shed your skin, rinse your heart and cast off desire, then wander in the wilds where no man dwells.

[Annotation] This means to be without a body, to forget one’s state, and to entrust oneself to spontaneous transformation.

[Subcommentary] *Kuxing* means to forget the body; *qupi* means to forget the state; *saxin* means to forget cunning; *quyu* means to cease coveting. The wilds where no man dwells are the realm of the Dao and virtue. As Guo’s annotation says, “This means to be without a body, to forget one’s state, and to entrust oneself to spontaneous transformation.” In the southern lands of Yue there is a city called the State of Established Virtue.

[Annotation] Yue is mentioned because it lies far from Lu.

[Subcommentary] Since it is distant from Lu, its name signifies the establishment of the Dao of non-action. Its people are simple and unadorned, with few private concerns and scant desires. They know how to work but not how to hoard.

[Subcommentary] *Zuo* means to till the fields; *cang* means to store up grain. Since the lord embraces the Dao, the people return to purity. They give without seeking repayment; they do not know where duty lies, nor do they recognize the practice of ritual.

[Subcommentary] *Yi* means what is fitting; *jiang* means to enact. They act wildly and without restraint,

[Subcommentary] *Changkuang* means without intention; *wangxing* means to mingle their traces. and thus tread the great Way.

[Annotation] Each follows their own steps, and each person naturally treads their own path—thus all paths are attained. Is this not vast?

[Subcommentary] *Dao* means the Way. Acting wildly and without restraint, mingling their traces in reckless motion, they are thus able to tread the great Way. Their lives may be joyful, and their deaths may be buried.

[Annotation] This means they may dwell in it from beginning to end.

[Subcommentary] As Guo’s annotation says, “This means they may dwell in it from beginning to end.” I wish that you would leave your state and abandon custom, then walk alongside the Dao as its companion.

[Annotation] To leave one’s state and abandon custom means to sweep clean what lies within the breast.

[Subcommentary] *Juan* means to cast aside. This means to discard custom and be guided by the supreme Dao of non-action. The lord said: That Way is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what am I to do?

[Annotation] This truly means to send him to the southern lands of Yue.

[Subcommentary] Their natures differ between delusion and awakening, hence the separation between Lu and Yue. Master Shinan said: My lord, do not be haughty in form,

[Annotation] *Xingju* means stumbling and obstruction.

[Subcommentary] Do not rely on your lofty station or bear yourself with arrogance. nor linger in residence.

[Annotation] *Liuju* means stagnation and attachment.

[Subcommentary] Follow things as they move, without clinging to glory or appearances. Let this be your carriage.

[Annotation] When form is equal to things and the heart transforms with them, one may entrust oneself to things as if they were one’s own carriage. The lord said: That Way is secluded and distant, with no people there. With whom would I be neighbors? I have no provisions, no food—how could I reach it?

[Subcommentary] Not yet having grasped solitary transformation, he cannot forget things. Master Shinan said: Lessen your lordly expenses, diminish your lordly desires—though you have no provisions, you will still have enough.

[Annotation] This is what is meant by “knowing contentment, there is nothing that is not sufficient.”

[Subcommentary] The Dao does not rely on things to be complete, but only on tranquility. Cross the river and float upon the sea,

[Subcommentary] The *jiang* is wisdom; the *hai* is the Dao. Wade through the river of supreme goodness, swim in the sea of the great Way. gaze upon it and see no shore, press onward and know no end.

[Annotation] This means to distance oneself from the passions and desires.

[Subcommentary] How could one know its limits? Those who see you off will all turn back from the shore,

[Annotation] If the lord desires to cut himself off, then the people will each return to guard their own place.

[Subcommentary] Those who see you off on your journey will reach the realm of the Dao and virtue, then return to their own proper stations. The *ya* is their place. From here, you will go far indeed.

[Annotation] This means to rise alone above the myriad things.

[Subcommentary] *Zi* means “from.” From here, you will ascend in purity, and the Dao and virtue will become profoundly distant. Thus, to possess others is a burden,

[Annotation] To possess others means to claim them as one’s own private property.

[Subcommentary] Ruling over the state of Lu, with its abundance of people and resources, and considering them as one’s own possession, is a deep affliction. and to be possessed by others is a sorrow.

[Annotation] To be possessed by others means to be used and employed by them.

[Subcommentary] Since you have not yet forgotten Lu, to be possessed by others means to revere spirits, honor the worthy, pity the people, and relieve the masses—this is to be enslaved by governance. Is this not a sorrow? Thus, Yao neither possessed others nor was possessed by them.

[Annotation] Though he ruled all under Heaven, he entrusted it to his officials and committed it to the myriad things without claiming it as his own—this is not to possess others. Allowing the people and things to follow their own natures without enslaving himself—this is not to be possessed by others.

[Subcommentary] As Guo’s annotation says, “Though he ruled all under Heaven, he entrusted it to his officials and committed it to the myriad things without claiming it as his own—this is not to possess others. Allowing the people and things to follow their own natures without enslaving himself—this is not to be possessed by others.” I wish to relieve you of your burdens, dispel your sorrows, and wander alone with the Dao in the boundless realm. Let two boats lashed together cross the river,

[Subcommentary] Two boats lashed side by side are called *fangzhou*. If an empty boat comes and strikes yours, even a man of narrow and hasty temper will not grow angry.

[Subcommentary] *Bian* means narrow and impatient. He will not grow angry because the boat is empty. But if there is a man aboard, one will shout to him to spread or draw in his oars...

When first called and unheard, then called again and still unheard, upon the third call—ah!—foul words must follow.

[Subcommentary] Foul words: curses and insults.
Before, he did not rage; now, he rages. Before, the boat was empty; now, it is full.
If one can empty oneself and wander through the world, who then can harm him?

[Commentary] Though the world may change, in emptying oneself to avoid harm, it is ever the same.

[Subcommentary] To empty oneself is to be without intent.

Beigong She,
[Subcommentary] Surnamed Beigong, named She. Dwelling in the northern palace, he took it as his surname.
was a grandee of Wei. For Duke Ling of Wei, he levied taxes to cast bells, erecting an altar beyond the outer gate of the capital.

[Subcommentary] To cast bells, one must first offer sacrifice—hence the altar.
In three months, the upper and lower chimes were complete.

[Subcommentary] With upper and lower tones in harmony, the eight sounds were perfected—thus, the set was hung.

Prince Qingji saw this and asked, “What scheme has Wei devised?”

[Subcommentary] Prince Qingji, son of King Qingji of Zhou, was a grandee of Zhou. Seeing the exquisite bell-altar, he marveled and questioned him.

She replied, “At the first inquiry, I dared not contrive.”

[Commentary] He simply embraced the One—he did not presume to fabricate or embellish.

[Subcommentary] As Guo’s commentary says: *He simply embraced the One—he did not presume to fabricate or embellish.*

She had heard that once carved and polished, one returns to simplicity.

[Commentary] One restores one’s original nature.

[Subcommentary] As Guo’s commentary says: *One restores one’s original nature.*

Pitiable in his lack of discernment,
[Commentary] He simply followed his pure uncarved nature.

[Subcommentary] Pitiable: the appearance of being without emotion. He merely followed his unadulterated simplicity.

Unfettered in his release from doubt,
[Commentary] Without fixed direction.

[Subcommentary] Unfettered: without care. *Dai* means to withdraw. All hesitations and deliberations had departed.

Gathered yet boundless, he sent off the departing and welcomed the arriving,
[Commentary] Without attachment or delight.

[Subcommentary] Gathered: assembled. Though things gathered, he remained boundless, unaware. Whether things came or went, he neither welcomed nor sent them off—all below follows this principle of letting things be.
Alternatively: *Mang* means dim and indistinct, the mind without fixed intent, following the flow of arrivals and departures, allowing things to come and go.

Let those who come not be barred; let those who go not be detained,
[Commentary] Let them be as they are.

[Subcommentary] The people’s attachments to what comes are not forbidden, nor are those who depart detained with emotion.

Follow their strength and force,
[Commentary] Yield to their vigor.

Bend with their crooked turns,
[Commentary] Without constraint.

[Subcommentary] *Zhuan* is read as *zhuàn*. Those who are stubborn and difficult to tax, he followed and allowed. Those whose natures bent and twisted, he accommodated and complied with.

Let them reach their own limits,
[Commentary] Use what they cannot but be.

[Subcommentary] He let the people follow their own inclinations in all things.

Thus, though taxes were levied morning and evening, not a hair was harmed,
[Commentary] As it should be—no loss.

[Subcommentary] Though taxes were imposed, he never coerced or measured. Each followed their nature, so not a single one suffered harm.

how much more so for those who tread the great path?

[Commentary] Abiding in vast non-attachment, letting all under Heaven act of their own accord—this is the path of great passage. Thus, it is said: *Plan and tend to it, but do not call it completion.*

[Subcommentary] *Tu* means path. Governing by letting things be, even if one bends to accommodate, how much more so when relying on the great Dao, where spiritual transformation arises from non-action? That the bells were completed in three months—what wonder is there in that?

Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food.

[Subcommentary] King Zhao of Chu summoned Confucius. On his journey from Lu to Chu, he passed between the states of Chen and Cai. His retinue was large, and the people of Chen and Cai, mistaking him for Yang Hu, raised troops to surround him. His disciples suffered hunger, going seven days without cooked food, pressed and distressed.

Taigong Ren went to offer his condolences, saying, “You nearly died, did you not?”
He replied, “Yes.”
“Do you hate death?”
He replied, “Yes.”

[Commentary] He merely aligned with likes and dislikes—sages have no likes or dislikes.

[Subcommentary] Taigong was a title of Laozi. *Ren* was his name. *Ji* means near. *Ran* means “it is so.” Confucius, having been besieged, was nearly dead. Taigong came to offer condolences and asked, “You nearly died, did you not?” He answered, “It is so.” Taigong asked, “Do you hate death?”

He replied, “It is so.”
Taigong Ren said, “You once spoke of the Way of not dying. By the Eastern Sea there is a bird, whose name is *Yidai*. As a bird, it is scattered and disordered, appearing incapable; it takes flight only with support, and perches only when pressed. It dares not take the lead in flight, nor lag behind in retreat. It dares not be the first to eat, but must take what remains. Thus its place in the flock is never rejected, and others never harm it—so it avoids misfortune. The straight tree is the first felled; the sweet well is the first drained. Talent brings harm. You, perhaps, adorn your wisdom to startle the foolish, cultivate yourself to expose others’ filth, and shine forth as if bearing the sun and moon—how could you escape calamity?

I once heard the Perfect One say: ‘He who boasts of himself achieves no merit; he who clings to success meets ruin; he who attains fame suffers loss.’ Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the common? The Dao flows unseen; dwelling in attainment, it claims no place. Pure and constant, it seems like madness. Shaving away edges, discarding power, it seeks no merit or fame. Thus it bears no blame from others, and others bear none from it. The Perfect One remains unknown—why do you delight in this?”

Confucius said, “Well said.”
He parted from his acquaintances, dismissed his disciples, and fled to the great marsh. Clad in coarse furs, he ate acorns and chestnuts. Entering among beasts, he did not disturb the herd; entering among birds, he did not disrupt their flight. Birds and beasts felt no aversion—how much less would men?

Confucius asked Zisang Hu, “I was twice exiled from Lu, my tree felled in Song, my traces erased in Wei, impoverished between Shang and Zhou, besieged between Chen and Cai. I have endured these many hardships—why have my close associates grown more distant, and my disciples and friends more scattered?”

Zisang Hu, whose surname was Sang and given name Yu, was a recluse. When Confucius served as Minister of Crime in Lu, the people of Qi, hearing of this, selected female musicians and patterned horses to present to the Lord of Lu. They enticed the Lord of Lu, and as a result, Confucius was exiled. Song was a descendant of the Yin. When Confucius was in Song and Zhou, he was not employed, hence the term "impoverished." Facing these trials and hardships, his relatives and close associates grew increasingly distant, while his disciples and friends became ever more scattered—why was this so?

Zisang Hu said, “Have you not heard of the flight of the people of Jia? Lin Hui abandoned a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces and fled carrying a child on his back. Someone asked, ‘Was it for the sake of wealth? The child’s wealth is meager indeed. Was it for the sake of burden? The child’s burden is great indeed.’ Why then did he abandon the jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces and flee carrying the child on his back?”

Lin Hui said, “That was bound by profit, this by Heaven’s bond. Those bound by profit, when pressed by poverty, calamity, or harm, abandon one another; those bound by Heaven’s bond, when pressed by poverty, calamity, or harm, cling all the more closely. The distance between clinging and abandoning is vast indeed.”

The jade disc was bound by profit; the child was bound by kinship. In times of urgency, kinship clings together, while profit-driven bonds are abandoned in hardship. The difference between abandonment and clinging is indeed great.

Moreover, the friendship of the noble is as bland as water, while the friendship of the petty is as sweet as sweet wine. The noble, though bland, grow closer; the petty, though sweet, grow estranged. When profit is absent, they are bland; when the Way aligns, they grow close. When profit is present, they are sweet; when profit is exhausted, they part. Those who unite without cause will part without cause.

Confucius said, “I respectfully receive your instruction.” He walked slowly, wandering freely as he returned, abandoned his learning, and discarded his books. His disciples no longer bowed before him, yet their affection for him grew ever deeper.

Another day, Zisang Hu said, “When Shun was about to die, he truly instructed Yu, saying, ‘Be vigilant! In form, nothing is better than following; in feeling, nothing is better than sincerity. Following does not lead to separation; sincerity does not lead to exhaustion. Not separating, not exhausting, one does not seek adornment to sustain form. Not seeking adornment to sustain form, one does not depend on external things.’”

Zhuangzi wore coarse cloth patched with hemp, tied his shoes with cords, and passed by the King of Wei. The King of Wei said, “Why is the Master so weary?”

Zhuangzi replied, “It is poverty, not weariness. For a scholar who possesses the Way and virtue yet cannot practice them, that is weariness. Worn clothes and tattered shoes—this is poverty, not weariness. This is what is called not encountering the right time. Have you alone not seen the gibbon? When it obtains catalpa, nanmu, or camphorwood, it grasps the vines, swings among the branches, and reigns supreme in its domain. Even Yi or Feng Meng could not take aim at it.”

The *nan* (楠), *zi* (梓), and *yuzhang* (豫章) are all straight and fine trees. "Grasping the vines" means to seize and hold. "Reigning supreme" means to be self-content. Yi was a master archer of antiquity. Feng Meng was Yi’s disciple. *Pini* (睥睨) means to glance sideways. Some texts write this character as *guo* (聒), which when read conveys that when a worthy scholar or sagely person encounters the right time and place, it is like a gibbon obtaining straight trees—leaping and bounding freely, so that even a master archer dare not raise his eyes to take aim, much less draw his bow.

Yet when it finds itself among brambles, thorns, and tangled roots, it moves cautiously, glances warily, trembles and quakes. This is not because its sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened and lost their suppleness, but because its circumstances are unfavorable, and it cannot fully display its abilities.

The *tuo* (拓), *ji* (棘), and *gou* (枸) are all thorny, noxious trees. When a gibbon finds itself among thorned trees, it cannot exhibit its agility and skill, and so its heart grieves and it shudders, its bearing becomes hesitant and its gaze sidelong—not because its sinews and bones differ from before, but because its situation is unfavorable. A scholar who encounters a chaotic age must be the same. Now, dwelling amid a benighted ruler and disordered ministers, how could one avoid weariness? This is like Bi Gan, whose heart was carved out as punishment.

When circumstances are unfavorable and one forces action, one invites execution. This is the analogy made complete.

When the Zhou royal house had grown weak and the six states flourished, rulers above were benighted while ministers below were in chaos. Master Zhuang, though holding the Dao and embracing virtue, could find no use for his talents. He withdrew to avoid harm and thus spoke these words. In former times, King Zhou of Yin was without the Way, and Bi Gan, though loyal in remonstrance, was put to death with his heart carved out—was this not proof? Citing the past to illuminate the present serves as a mirror for future days.

Confucius was beset between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Leaning against a withered tree, he struck its dry branches with a stone and sang the wind of Shen Nong. Though the implements were present, the measures were absent; though the sounds were there, the notes of gong and jue were not. Yet the sound of wood and the sound of man, clear and resonant, found their place in the human heart.

Shen Nong was the Divine Farmer. Confucius, a sage, was at peace with both adversity and good fortune. Though he suffered hardship in Chen and Cai, he did not abandon nonaction. Thus, with his left hand he struck the withered wood and with his right snapped the dry branches, content in himself, singing the pure wind of Shen Nong. Wood is one of the eight sounds, yet though struck, it produced no melody; without voice, only the beating of wood—how could there be gong or shang? Yet the song’s voice and the wood’s sound, clear and serene, were joyous and correct, resonating with the heart and finding their place in the human heart.

Yan Hui, upright and composed, turned his gaze to observe. Fearing that his disciple might overestimate him and aspire to greatness, or pity him and fall into sorrow—Yan Hui, seeing Confucius strike the wood and sing, straightened his posture and turned his eyes to watch. Confucius, concerned that he had not yet awakened and was making wild conjectures, thinking that his master sought to expand his virtue and aim for high position, or grieved for himself in hardship and composed mournful tunes—fearing this, he called him and instructed him, saying: "Hui, to not accept the harm of Heaven is easy. To not accept the benefit of man is difficult."

Only by being at peace with it is it easy. Things that come by chance cannot be restrained.

In the principle of nature, there is the harm of adversity. When one aligns with fate and accepts it, it becomes easy. In the way of human relations, there is the benefit of emolument. When it comes by chance and is entrusted to one, to relinquish it is difficult. This shows that though Confucius struck the wood and sang, he had no heart for sorrow or resentment.

There is no beginning that is not an end. What is called a beginning in the present was an end in the past, so what is called a beginning is already an end. This speaks of the endlessness of transformation.

An end is a conclusion. What is a beginning in the present was a conclusion in the past. This is meant to show that there is no beginning or end, no birth or death. With neither death nor birth, how can there be sorrow for adversity?

Man and Heaven are one. Both are of nature.

What is called the harm of Heaven and the benefit of man is still the language of instruction. When it comes to the principle of doubt, all is nature, and so there is no duality.

Who is it that sings now? If one lets things be as they are, then the singer is not I.

The great sage is empty and forgetful, having lost both self and things. If I am not I, then who is it that sings? If I have no self, where can the song reside?

Yan Hui said: "May I ask about not accepting the harm of Heaven being easy?"

Confucius said: "Hunger and thirst, cold and heat, adversity and obstruction—these are the workings of Heaven and Earth, the outflow of the movement of things. They cannot be escaped.

Earlier, the names were briefly stated; below, their meaning is explained. Adversity is obstruction. When fate reaches its limit and obstruction, and the Dao and virtue cannot be put into practice, this is like Heaven and Earth’s emptiness and fullness, the turning of the four seasons, the movement of the myriad things, and the release of qi. This is what is meant by moving along with them.

This is what is called not knowing or recognizing yet following the pattern of the Lord.

The *Exegesis* states: "偕 means 'together'; 逝 means 'to go.' Having embodied the impermanence of the movement of things, one goes along with transformation and moves together with it, without delight or aversion in the process. As a minister, one does not dare to depart from this. If even the way of the minister is thus, how much more so the way of awaiting Heaven?"

The *Annotation* states: "Wherever one is, one is at peace. Not taking harm as harm—this is awaiting Heaven without receiving its harm."

The *Exegesis* states: "As a minister, one does not dare to flee from the ruler’s command. Holding to the way of the minister, one naturally acts thus. How much more so when facing the transformations of fortune and adversity, awaiting the principle of spontaneity—how could one resist it? What is meant by 'not accepting the benefit of others being difficult'?"

Confucius said: "At the beginning, one’s influence extends in all four directions." The *Annotation* states: "Resonance and response spread in all directions, making one’s reach fourfold." "Rank and emolument arrive together without end." The *Annotation* states: "Because one’s influence spreads in all directions, one can govern what is lofty and great." "What benefits things is not one’s own doing." The *Annotation* states: "It is not sought or taken by oneself."

The *Exegesis* states: "始 means 'root'; 乃 means 'proper.' The wondrous root is empty and tranquil. Advancing to respond to the moment, one’s influence spreads in all four directions, congealing illumination to the nine limits. Having attained fine rank and inexhaustible wealth and virtue, the benefits sought by the myriad things are as they should be. My mandate lies in what is external." The *Annotation* states: "In human life, there is also the mandate of engaging with things externally, unlike tiles and stones, which are confined to form and substance alone."

The *Exegesis* states: "Confucius, the sage, was endowed by Heaven’s mandate. Exerting this external power, he saved the black-haired people—he was not like tiles or stones in mere form and substance. The noble person does not act as a thief; the worthy person does not act as a pilferer. If I were to take these, what would I be doing?" The *Annotation* states: "Theft and pilfering refer to taking for oneself. Now, the noble person and the worthy person receive rank and emolument through governance—they do not take them for themselves but merely accept them."

The *Exegesis* states: "If even the worthy person and the noble person do not act as thieves or pilferers, how much less would the great sage Confucius violate Heaven and go against principle to take rank and emolument for himself? If they come by chance and are entrusted to one, one merely accepts them—this is without intent. Thus it is said: Among birds, none is wiser than the swallow. Where its eyes do not deem fitting to dwell, it does not linger to look, and even if it drops its food, it abandons it and flees." The *Annotation* states: "The swiftness of avoiding misfortune."

The *Exegesis* states: "鹤鹤 refers to the swallow. 实 means 'food.' Among birds, none is better at avoiding harm and preserving itself than the swallow. When it flies into a human dwelling to build its nest, if even a glance shows the place to be unsuitable, it does not wait to examine it thoroughly but flies far away. Even if it drops food to the ground, it hastily abandons it and flees, never turning back to retrieve it—such is the swiftness of avoiding misfortune. Its fear of humans leads it to nest among them." The *Annotation* states: "There has never been one who estranged itself from others and yet was cherished by them. Fearing humans yet entering their dwellings—this is why the swallow is called wise."

The *Exegesis* states: "袭 means 'to enter.' The swallow fears humans yet relies on them for shelter, entering their dwellings to build its nest. Thus, humans grow fond of it and become familiar with it, allowing it to escape harm. This is like the sage blending with the world, advancing among people, cautiously guarding against calamity, and not sinking into the dust of the world. The black-haired people joyfully esteem him without tiring, enabling him to endure and live long. Thus, the altars of soil and grain are preserved." The *Annotation* states: "As for the utmost person, they merge profoundly with the world. The world joyfully esteems them without tiring, joining together to establish altars of soil and grain for them. This is why not accepting the benefit of others is so difficult."

The *Exegesis* states: "The sage’s virtue spreads far and wide, and all beings joyfully esteem him. That the altars of soil and grain endure is as it should be. This is what is meant by 'the benefit of others.' What is meant by 'there being no beginning that is not an end'?"

Confucius said: "Transforming the myriad things without knowing who succeeds them." The *Annotation* states: "One does not perceive the change." The *Exegesis* states: "禅 means 'to succeed.' The Dao gives life to the myriad things, transforming and changing in all directions, revolving without cease. Renewing daily, one does not perceive the succession. Thus, one does not sense the alternation. If there is no daily renewal and change, how can there be beginning and end? How can one know where it ends? How can one know where it begins? One merely awaits it uprightly."

The *Annotation* states: "Day and night succeed one another without end. Thus, one awaits it uprightly, without harboring anything in the heart." The *Exegesis* states: "End is beginning, and beginning is end—how can one definitively know end and beginning? Since there is no end or beginning, there is no death or life. Thus, one follows transformation as it comes, finding all encounters fitting. Embracing and guarding the true, one awaits the Creator alone."

"What is meant by 'human and Heaven being one'?"

Confucius said: "There being humans is Heaven; there being Heaven is also Heaven." The *Annotation* states: "What is called Heaven is all that is spontaneous and not made." The *Exegesis* states: "Human relationships and the myriad things are all spontaneous. Extending to spontaneity itself, thus human and Heaven are not two, and the myriad things merge as one. That humans cannot possess Heaven is their nature." The *Annotation* states: "To speak of spontaneity is to speak of spontaneity. How can humans intentionally possess this spontaneity? It is spontaneous, thus it is called nature."

The *Exegesis* states: "Those who lose spontaneity do not know why things are as they are—they are spontaneous, not made. How could they be possessed? Thus, what is spontaneous is nature, not possessed by humans. This explains the earlier meaning of 'there being Heaven.' The sage is at peace, embodying transformation and coming to an end." The *Annotation* states: "At peace without self-importance, the body moves together with change." The *Exegesis* states: "晏然 means 'at peace'; 逝 means 'to go.' The sage understands that beginning and end are not two, and that death and life are one. Thus, they can peacefully dissolve the body, follow transformation, and go forth, drifting without beginning, ending as change dictates."

Zhuang Zhou wandered within the wattle fence of Carved Mound, where he saw an extraordinary magpie coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet, its eyes measured a full inch in circumference, and it brushed against Zhuang Zhou’s forehead before alighting in the chestnut grove.

The *Annotation* states: "Carved Mound is the name of a chestnut orchard. *Fan* means 'fence.' Thus, he wandered within the chestnut orchard’s wattle enclosure. *Yun* means 'round.' *Gan* means 'to strike.' *Ke* means 'forehead.' An unusual magpie came from the south, its wings seven feet long, its eyes a full inch in circumference. It struck Zhuangzi’s forehead and then perched in the chestnut grove."

Zhuang Zhou said: "What bird is this? Its wings are vast yet it cannot fly far, its eyes are large yet it cannot see clearly?" He hiked up his robes, quickened his steps, grasped his sling, and waited in ambush.

The *Annotation* states: "*Yin* means 'large.' *Shi* means 'to go.' *Pubu* means 'to hasten.' *Liu* means 'to lie in wait.' Its wings were large but it could not fly far, its eyes were large but it could not see clearly. Zhuangzi, marveling at this, resolved to pursue it. He quickened his steps, took up his sling, and lay in wait."

He then saw a cicada, which had found a fine shade and forgotten its own body. A mantis, seizing a leaf to conceal itself, struck at the cicada, seeing only its prey and forgetting its own form.

The *Commentary* states: "It held a leaf to hide itself from the cicada, forgetting that its form was exposed to the strange magpie."

The strange magpie, seeing this advantage, seized the opportunity, forgetting its true nature in pursuit of gain.

The *Commentary* states: "The ability to see and the power to fly—these are the magpie’s true nature. Now, seeing gain, it forgot them."

The *Annotation* states: "*Bo* means 'to seize.' *Zhen* means 'nature and life.' Zhuangzi, sling in hand, had not yet loosed it when he suddenly saw a cicada hidden among the leaves, delighting in the shade and unaware of its own body. A mantis, holding a leaf to conceal itself, focused on seizing the cicada and forgot that its form was exposed to the strange magpie. The strange magpie, following the mantis, took advantage of the opportunity to seize the cicada, intent on gain and unaware of the danger to its own life—this is what is meant by 'forgetting its true nature.'"

Zhuang Zhou sighed and said: "Alas! Things inevitably entangle one another."

The *Commentary* states: "Those who seek advantage from one another are inevitably burdened by one another."

The *Annotation* states: "Having witnessed the cicada and magpie pursuing gain and forgetting themselves, he sighed in alarm. Thus, he knew that those who seek advantage from things are burdened by cares. The two kinds summoned one another."

The *Commentary* states: "Those who desire something from things are also desired by those things."

The *Annotation* states: "Those who desire something from things are also desired by them. Thus, the cicada and magpie, both creatures of the world, summoned one another through gain and harm—this is how it must be."

He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the forester pursued and rebuked him.

The *Commentary* states: "*Sui* means 'to question.'"

The *Annotation* states: "*Juan* means 'to discard.' The *yuren* was the forester in charge of the chestnut grove. *Sui* means 'to question.' Realizing that gain and harm follow one another, he discarded his sling and fled. The forester, suspecting him of stealing chestnuts, pursued and questioned him."

Zhuang Zhou returned home and did not emerge for three months. Lan Ju followed and asked him: "Master, why have you not come forth from your chamber these past days?"

The *Annotation* states: "Zhuang Zhou, having seen the magpie forget itself and been suspected of stealing chestnuts, returned home in shame and did not leave his chamber. Lan Ju, a disciple of Zhuangzi, wondered at his master’s recent seclusion and followed to ask him."

Zhuang Zhou said: "I guarded my form and forgot my body."

The *Commentary* states: "Living among people, one encounters both safety and peril. To impose a form suited to peace upon this world without considering what is fitting for it—this is to guard one’s form and forget one’s body."

"I observed the muddy water and became confused by the clear spring."

The *Commentary* states: "Seeing that and failing to understand, one uses it to see oneself, nearly forgetting the way of returning to reflection."

The *Annotation* states: "I saw gain and pursued things, clinging to my form, and thus, with harm and gain summoning one another, I forgot my body. Having witnessed the magpie and cicada, I returned home and did not emerge, reflecting in self-reproach. Thus, I observed the muddy water to become confused by the clear spring—though this was not my original nature, it still held the way of returning to reflection."

"Moreover, I have heard my Master say: 'Enter their customs, follow their customs.'"

The *Commentary* states: "Do not violate their prohibitions."

The *Annotation* states: "Zhuang Zhou studied under Lao Dan, so he referred to Laozi as his Master. The enlightened move with the dust and enter customs; where customs have prohibitions, they follow them. Now, having wandered in Carved Mound, I was suspected of stealing chestnuts and lightly transgressed the law—this is the language of remorse."

"Now, I wandered in Carved Mound and forgot my body. The strange magpie struck my forehead, and I wandered in the chestnut grove and forgot my true nature. The forester of the chestnut grove took me for a thief, and this is why I have not emerged."

The *Commentary* states: "He took being questioned as a disgrace."

The *Annotation* states: "Zhuangzi extended impartiality to the world, so he often expressed his meaning through words, even criticizing Confucius, disparaging Lao Dan, and above, attacking the Three Sovereigns, while below, lamenting the afflictions of his own body. His intent was on the strange magpie, yet he forgot the prohibitions of the chestnut grove—this was to forget his body. The character *zhen* may also be read as *zhen* (true), following the pronunciation. The forester took me for a chestnut thief, bringing such shame upon myself—this is why I have not emerged. Zhuangzi was a great man, yet he concealed himself in a lowly position, wandering in Song, nurturing his nature in the lacquer garden. How could he have been confused by the clear spring or preoccupied with gain and harm? He merely sought to evaluate and refine his nature, even to the point of harming his own body."

Yangzi traveled to Song and lodged at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other ugly. The ugly one was favored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yangzi asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s servant replied: "The beautiful one takes herself to be beautiful, but I do not see her beauty. The ugly one takes herself to be ugly, but I do not see her ugliness."

[Commentary] His surname was Yang, given name Zhu, courtesy name Ziju, and he was a man of Qin. *Inn* refers to a lodging house. Traveling to the state of Song, he stayed at an inn along the way. The beautiful one relied on her beauty, so others forgot her beauty and took no notice of it; the ugly one humbled herself and considered herself unworthy, so others forgot her ugliness and took no notice of it.

Yangzi said: "Disciples, take note of this. Conduct yourself with worthiness, yet discard the conduct of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be beloved?" [Annotation] This speaks of the Way of worthiness, which is ever appropriate.

[Commentary] To cultivate virtue and establish conduct while relinquishing the heart that exalts oneself and belittles others—where could one go and not be cherished and esteemed? Thus, he instructed his disciples to remember this.

Master Cheng Xuan Ying of the Tang, in his *Subcommentary on the Outer Chapters*, "Tian Zifang" Twenty-First:

Tian Zifang was in attendance at the court of Marquis Wen of Wei, frequently praising Xi Gong.

[Subcommentary] His surname was Tian, given name Wuze, courtesy name Zifang. He was a worthy man of Wei and the teacher of Marquis Wen. Marquis Wen was the seventh-generation descendant of Bi Wan and the father of Marquis Wu. The surname of Xi Gong was Xi, his given name Gong, and he too was a worthy man of Wei.

Marquis Wen said: "Xi Gong—is he your teacher?"
Zifang replied: "No. He is a fellow villager of mine. His praises of the Way often accord with principle, so I speak of him."
[Subcommentary] Xi Gong was a man of the same village as Zifang. His words on the Way frequently aligned with truth, so Wuze praised him—yet he was not his teacher.

Marquis Wen said: "Then do you have no teacher?"
Zifang said: "I do."
The Marquis asked: "Who is your teacher?"
Zifang said: "Dongguo Shunzi."
Marquis Wen said: "Then why have you never spoken of him?"
[Subcommentary] He lived east of the outer wall, hence his surname. His given name was Shunzi, and he was Zifang’s teacher. Since he was your teacher’s teacher, why have you never mentioned him?

Zifang said: "His way of being is true."
[Annotation] Without pretense.
[Subcommentary] What is called a true man of the Way.
"His appearance is human, yet his nature is Heaven."
[Annotation] Though his form resembles that of others, he alone follows the natural.
[Subcommentary] Though his outward form accords with human principles, his heart is in harmony with the natural.
"He is empty and follows things, yet preserves the true."
[Annotation] Empty and in accord with things, thus the true is never lost.
[Subcommentary] *Yuan* means to follow. With an empty heart, he follows things while steadfastly guarding the true source—moving yet ever still.
"Pure yet accommodating of things."
[Annotation] Purity rests in great clarity; now, pure yet accommodating of things, he is one with Heaven.
[Subcommentary] As Guo’s annotation states: "Purity rests in great clarity; now, pure yet accommodating of things, he is one with Heaven."
"When things lack the Way, he rectifies his bearing to awaken them, causing their deluded minds to dissolve."
[Annotation] Vast and clear, empty and upright—he rectifies himself alone, and the perversity of things naturally fades.
[Subcommentary] When worldly things lack the Way—when people are perverse and crooked—Dongguo rectifies his own bearing to enlighten them, causing their confused and disordered minds to dissolve of themselves.
"How could one such as I be worthy to speak of him?"
[Subcommentary] The teacher’s profound virtue is so abstruse that one as mediocre and coarse as I am unworthy to extol it.

Zifang departed. Marquis Wen, lost in thought, remained silent the entire day. He summoned the ministers standing before him and said: "How distant indeed is the gentleman of perfect virtue!"
[Subcommentary] *Tangran* describes a state of self-forgetfulness. Having heard of Shunzi’s virtue, he was so overwhelmed that he lost all sense of himself, hence his silence for the rest of the day. Thereupon, he summoned the ministers attending him and spoke to them, sighing that Dongguo’s Way was profound and unfathomable, and that a man of perfect virtue could indeed govern all things.

"At first, I took the sagely wisdom of the ancients and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness to be the ultimate. But now, having heard of Zifang’s teacher, my body has dissolved and I have no desire to move; my mouth is sealed and I have no wish to speak."
[Annotation] He realized his own shallowness.
"What I have studied is but a clay effigy—"
[Annotation] Not a true thing.
[Subcommentary] At first, I pursued learning, taking the sagely wisdom of the former kings and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness of Zhou and Confucius to be the ultimate in principle. But now, having heard of Zifang’s teacher, his Way is so vast and profound that my body has become unstrung and I cannot move, my mouth and tongue are bound and I have nothing to say. I realize that what I have studied is but a clay figure—crumbling in the rain, not a true thing. A *tu geng* is a clay figure.
"Truly, the state of Wei has become a burden to me."
[Annotation] Knowing what is most precious, he saw rank as a fetter.
[Subcommentary] Having heard the true Way and embodied sitting in forgetfulness, he understood that official position and earthen altars were but sources of care and encumbrance.

When Wenbo Xuezi journeyed to Qi, he lodged in Lu. A man of Lu requested an audience with him. Wenbo Xuezi said: "It cannot be. I have heard that the gentlemen of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but clumsy in understanding the human heart. I do not wish to meet them."
[Subcommentary] His surname was Wen, given name Bo, courtesy name Xuezi. He was a man of Chu who embodied the Way. *Zhongguo* refers to the state of Lu. *Lou* means clumsy.

When traveling from Chu to Qi, he passed through Lu and stayed at a host’s lodging. The people of Lu, being disciples of Confucius, had heard of Wenbo Xuezi’s worthiness and requested to meet him. Wenbo refused, saying: “I have heard that the people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness and the teachings of the sages, yet clumsy in understanding the human heart. This is why I do not wish to meet them.”

Upon reaching Qi and returning to stay in Lu, the same man again requested an audience.
[Subcommentary] After Wenbo arrived in Qi, he returned to lodge in Lu, where the same man once more sought to meet him.

Wenbo Xuezi said: “Before, he sought me out, and now he seeks me again—he must have some purpose in moving me.”
[Subcommentary] *Xin* means to seek. *Zhen* means to stir. When I first went to Qi, he sought to meet me, and now that I have returned to Lu, he comes again to seek me. He must have some other reason, wishing to affect me with his intent.

He went out to meet the guest and, upon returning, sighed. The next day, after meeting the guest again, he entered and sighed once more. His servant asked: “Every time you meet this guest, you return and sigh. Why is that?”
[Subcommentary] After meeting the guest both times, he repeatedly sighed to himself. Wenbo’s servant, puzzled, questioned him.

He replied: “I had already told you: the people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but clumsy in understanding the human heart. The one who met me before advanced and retreated in perfect circles and squares, moving with the grace of a dragon or the prowess of a tiger.”
[Annotation] His steps were winding, his advance meandering.
[Subcommentary] His bowing, kneeling, yielding, and deferring—his every motion was precise in form, his movements as sinuous as a dragon, as powerful as a tiger.

“His admonitions to me were like those of a son; his guidance, like that of a father.”
[Annotation] Such are the distortions wrought by ritual and righteousness.
[Subcommentary] He corrected me as a son admonishes a father; he instructed me as a father teaches a son. Though distance and proximity, honor and humility, each have their proper place in human feeling, these are not of our innate nature—why then such earnest effort? Thus I know that the distortions of the sagely Way have led to such artificiality, and so I sigh.

Confucius met him and said nothing.
[Annotation] He already understood his heart.

Zilu said: “Master, you have long wished to meet Wenbo Xuezi. Now that you have met him, you say nothing. Why is that?”
[Subcommentary] The two shared a meeting of minds, forgetting words. Zilu, puzzled, asked the reason.

Confucius replied: “In the case of such a man, the Dao is present the moment one’s gaze meets his—there is no room for words.”
[Annotation] The moment one’s eyes meet, understanding is already complete; there is no need to make room for his virtuous speech.
[Subcommentary] *Ji* means to move. One who embodies realization grasps the principle without words. The moment one’s gaze moves, the profound Dao is already present—there is no need for further effort or wasted speech to make room for verbal explanation.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: “When you walk, I walk; when you hasten, I hasten; when you run, I run. Yet when you race ahead, leaving all dust behind, I can only stare blankly from behind.”
Confucius said: “Hui, what do you mean?”

He replied: “When you walk, I walk; when you speak, I speak; when you hasten, I hasten; when you debate, I debate; when you run, I run; when you speak of the Dao, I too speak of the Dao. Yet when you race ahead, leaving all dust behind, and I can only stare blankly from behind—it is because you do not speak yet are trusted, do not draw close yet are all-embracing, hold no rank yet the people gather before you, and I do not know how this comes to be.”
[Subcommentary] *Benyi juechen* means to run swiftly. *Cheng* describes a fixed gaze. Racing ahead, leaving all dust behind, one cannot be caught—thus one can only stare blankly from behind. *Qi* refers to official rank. The Master does not speak yet is trusted by others; though he does not draw close, he moves in harmony with all things. Though he holds no lordly position, the people gather before him. Not knowing how this comes to be, one can only accept it as it is—this is what is meant by racing ahead, leaving all dust behind.

Confucius said: “Alas! Should this not be examined?”

The greatest sorrow lies not in death, but in the death of the heart—while the death of the body is but secondary.
[Annotation] The heart takes its own death as true death, yet clings even more fiercely to that death; its swift demise arises from sorrow’s self-destruction. Without sorrow, all would be well—yet if sorrow exists, the death of the heart becomes the greatest sorrow of all.
[Subcommentary] To move in harmony without drawing near, to be trusted without speaking—this arises from an empty heart in accord with things, not from mere happenstance. How can one fail to reflect deeply, to examine with a lotus heart? Of all the burdens of emotion, none surpasses the heart’s mutability. Its arising and ceasing, its birth and decay—these are profoundly sorrowful, while the sorrow of life and death is but secondary.

The sun rises in the east and sets in the westernmost reaches; all things follow its course,
[Annotation] All is visible.
[Subcommentary] As night yields to day, as the sun emerges in the east and sinks in the west, so too do people enter darkness and emerge into light, die and come to life. Thus we know that human life and death are like the sun’s day and night—why cling to such comparisons? Yet all creatures with eyes and feet depend on this to fulfill their purpose,
[Annotation] Eyes fulfill the work of seeing, feet the work of movement.
[Subcommentary] *Zhi* means feet. Of the hundred parts of the body, all are endowed by yin and yang; eyes see and feet move, relying on the transformations of creation. Without this, how could they achieve their purpose? Thus we know that life and death are not within human control. When the sun emerges, it exists; when it sets, it vanishes.
[Annotation] It is merely unseen that we call "vanished"—in truth, it does not vanish.
[Subcommentary] Seeing the sun rise, we call it existence; seeing it set, we call it vanishing. This is but the deluded grasping of fleeting emotions, not the penetrating vision of the sage. All things are likewise: what depends on concealment dies, what depends on manifestation lives.
[Annotation] What depends on concealment is called death; what depends on manifestation is called life—yet in truth, there is no death or life.
[Subcommentary] The concealment and manifestation of things all depend on creation. Concealment is called death, manifestation is called life. Since the sun’s rising and setting entail no true existence or vanishing, how can things’ concealment and manifestation involve true life and death?

Once I receive my completed form, I do not transform but await its end,
[Annotation] What is cannot become nothing; thus, having received its completed form, it transforms without end.
[Subcommentary] My form and nature are endowed by creation. Once beauty or ugliness is determined, the mold is set. After this fixed state, there is no further change—only a steadfast awaiting of its end. Since beauty and ugliness are not of my own making, how can I not accept life and death as they come? I move in response to things,
[Annotation] Without self-will.
[Subcommentary] The utmost sage, empty and still, responds to what comes. Moving when things move, he is without self-will. Day and night without gap,
[Annotation] Ever transforming, ever new.
[Subcommentary] Transformation is ceaselessly renewed, without the slightest pause. Yet I do not know its end;
[Annotation] Not taking death as death.
[Subcommentary] Following it, I cannot see its conclusion. Fuming, my form is completed,
[Annotation] Fuming, it completes itself—what else is there to do?
[Subcommentary] *Fuming* describes the manner of spontaneous movement. Fuming, it receives qi and completes its form—nothing makes it so. Knowing fate, I cannot plan for what lies ahead; thus I daily follow the Ancestor.
[Annotation] Not bound to what lies ahead, I move with change—hence I daily follow the Ancestor.
[Subcommentary] *Zu* means to proceed. Though I understand the changes of time, I cannot prearrange a model; embodying daily renewal, I thus proceed with transformation.

All my life, I clasped your arm and lost you—is this not sorrowful?
[Annotation] Change cannot be grasped or detained. Thus, though we clasp arms and remain together, we cannot make it stop. If one mourns death, this too is cause for sorrow. Yet now I have not taken this as sorrow—why mourn death alone?
[Subcommentary] Confucius and Yan Hui, sage and worthy, cultivated the same body, yet each was like an arm clasped in passing. As transformation daily renews, flowing swiftly away, how can one grasp and hold fast? In the moment of clasping an arm, it is already gone—what was new has already departed. Thus we lose it. If we grieve this loss, it is deeply sorrowful. You are likely attached to what I am attached to.

That has already perished, yet you seek it as if it still exists—this is like seeking a horse in an empty marketplace.
[Annotation] A marketplace is no place to stop a horse. To seek what once existed is to seek what cannot be recovered. Human life is like a horse passing through a marketplace—there is no moment of pause, only the ceaseless succession of old and new, blending day and night. *Zhuo* means to see. You are likely seeing what I see. What I see is daily renewal—thus it has already perished. How can you still possess it?
[Subcommentary] *Dai* means near. *Zhuo* means to see. *Tang* is the road; *si* is the marketplace. What I see is the daily renewal of change. Yan Hui and Confucius spoke face to face; what was said before is not far off—hence the word *dai*. Yet that past matter has already vanished, and you still seek what once existed, as if it remained in the present—this is like seeking a horse in an empty marketplace. A marketplace is no place to stop a horse. When you saw the horse before, it was passing through the road and marketplace; now, when you search again, the horse has already gone. It is the same with what was said before—it has vanished, and seeking it now, the thing has already changed. Thus we know that the new ceaselessly departs, and transformation endlessly shifts.

I have long pondered you,
[Annotation] *Fu* means to reflect and hold in mind. *Shen wang* describes the swiftness of passing. You depart in an instant, and my thoughts cannot keep pace.
[Subcommentary] *Fu* means to reflect and contemplate.

The you of before has now faded away; when I reflect and ponder, it too is utterly lost. You, too, have long forgotten me.

[Annotation] Both are the same—whether wise or sagely, none can remain unchanged.

[Subcommentary] Transformation renews daily, making no distinction between the wise and the sagely.

Is this true only of you? It is also true of me. When you think of me, the past matter has likewise vanished. Yet why should you grieve? Though you forget the former me, there remains one who does not forget.

[Annotation] The one who does not forget persists—this refers to renewal with each passing day. Though the former me is forgotten, the new me has already arrived; it has never ceased to be me. How could I rest? Thus I can depart from the vulgar, transcend the dust, and merge with all things without obstruction.

[Subcommentary] The Dao of transformation never pauses for even a moment. Though the former me is lost, the new me still exists—this is the one who does not forget. Thus it has never ceased to be me. Why should you despair?

Confucius visited Lao Dan. Lao Dan had just washed his hair and was letting it dry with his hair loose, sitting so still he seemed not quite human.

[Annotation] The ultimate in tranquility and emptiness.

Confucius withdrew and waited.

[Subcommentary] After washing his hair, he exposed it to dry, concentrating his spirit in profound stillness, motionless as if withered wood—thus he seemed not quite human. Seeing this, Confucius dared not approach but moved aside to wait quietly.

After a while, he saw Lao Dan and said: "Was I deluded just now? Truly, it seemed so. A moment ago, Master, your body stood like withered wood, as if you had abandoned all things and departed from humanity, standing alone."

[Annotation] Only when body and mind are absent do external things depart.

[Subcommentary] In that brief moment, Confucius saw Laozi and exclaimed: "I saw the Master, and my eyes were dazzled, my form and wisdom forgotten—truly, he is a sage!" Yet he had already become distinct from others, forsaking all things, vanishing into the unfathomable and merging with solitary transformation.

Lao Dan said: "I let my mind wander in the origin of things."

[Annotation] The origin is what precedes being and yet reveres being. Thus, advancing to the origin of things, one then understands that things do not act yet exist of themselves.

[Subcommentary] The Dao gives birth to all things, so it is called the origin of things. Letting the mind wander in the origin of things means concentrating the spirit on the wondrous root, so that the body resembles withered wood and the heart is like dead ashes.

Confucius said: "What does that mean?"

Lao Dan replied: "The mind is exhausted and cannot know; the mouth is shut and cannot speak."

[Annotation] This urges Confucius to seek beyond words and meaning.

[Subcommentary] The sage’s mind is not incapable of knowing—it is that there is no method to know. It is not incapable of explaining—it is that there is no method to explain. To explain it would deviate from its essence; to know it would lose its truth. Thus we know the ultimate Dao is profoundly mysterious, transcending words and meaning—hence the mind is exhausted, the mouth is shut.

"Let me try to discuss it for you in broad terms. The utmost yin is solemn and still; the utmost yang blazes and shines. The solemn stillness emerges from heaven; the blazing brilliance arises from earth."

[Annotation] This speaks of their interaction.

[Subcommentary] Solemn stillness is the cold qi of yin; blazing brilliance is the hot qi of yang. They approach yin within yang and yang within yin—this speaks of their harmonious interaction.

"These two interact and harmonize, giving birth to things. Some act as their guiding principle, yet none see its form."

[Annotation] None see the form of the guiding principle—this clarifies its spontaneity.

[Subcommentary] Yang qi descends, yin qi ascends; the two qi interact and thus harmonize, giving birth to things through this harmony. They bathe and warm, freeze and thaw, governing all things, each transforming on its own—thus none see the form of the guiding principle.

"Waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness, darkness and light, the sun changes and the moon transforms. Each day brings new action,"

[Annotation] It never clings to the old.

[Subcommentary] Yin wanes and yang waxes, summer is full and winter empty, night is dark and day bright, the sun shifts and the moon changes—ever renewing, thus each day brings new action.

"Yet none see its achievement."

[Annotation] It is spontaneous, thus without achievement.

[Subcommentary] The profound workings are obscure and unfathomable, thus none see who enacts them. Life has its origins in sprouting—
[Annotation] Sprouting from what has not yet gathered.
[Subcommentary] Sprouting from nothingness.
Death has its return—
[Annotation] Returning to dispersion.
[Subcommentary] Returning to the unborn.
Beginning and end turn back upon the boundless, yet none know where they reach their limit.
[Annotation] As it is said: "Meet it and you do not see its head; follow it and you do not see its tail."
[Subcommentary] Death and life, end and beginning, cycle back and forth, without trace or thread—who knows where they find their limit? Thus the perfected person embodies understanding and allows things to transform. If not this, then what could serve as their source?
[Subcommentary] If not this Way of empty communication and life-transformation, who could be the source of the myriad things?

The things of the world, each and all, depend on the Dao.
Confucius said: "I venture to ask about wandering in this."
[Subcommentary] He asks: The mind of the Dao is the Dao—how does it unfold?
If one attains wandering in this, what further power or effort is needed?
Laozi said: To attain this is the utmost beauty and utmost joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy—this is called the perfected person.
[Annotation] The utmost beauty is without beauty; the utmost joy is without joy.
[Subcommentary] One who realizes the profound Dao finds beauty and delight—having attained the beauty of no-beauty and roamed the joy of no-joy, this may be called the person of utmost attainment.

Confucius said: "I wish to hear of its method."
[Subcommentary] *Method* here means the Way. He asks to be told the Way of utmost beauty and utmost joy.
Laozi said: Grass-eating beasts do not weary of changing marshes; water-dwelling creatures do not weary of changing waters. They undergo small changes yet do not lose their great constancy—
[Annotation] Death and life are also small changes.
[Subcommentary] *Weary* means to cease; *change* means to shift. Beasts that eat grass do not cease shifting marshes; creatures that live in water do not cease changing pools. So long as there is grass or water, they do not lose their great constancy—whether they go east or west is but a small change. Likewise, one who abides in the great Dao, following change and allowing transformation, never departs from the self. This is not losing the great constancy, for the changes of life and death are but small.

Joy and anger, sorrow and delight do not enter the breast.
[Annotation] Knowing that small changes do not lose the great constancy.
[Subcommentary] Joy follows; anger resists; delight arises from life; sorrow from death—these are the affairs of life’s edges. Yet if life and death bring no change to oneself, how could joy or anger enter the heart?

The world is that in which the myriad things are one. Attain this oneness and be at one with it, then your four limbs and hundred parts will become dust and grime, and life and death, beginning and end, will become like day and night—nothing can disturb this. And what of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune, where would they find their entry?
[Annotation] The more so as these are not worth troubling over.
[Subcommentary] The body of heaven and earth and the myriad things is undivided. One who grasps this truth can merge all into oneness. Thus self and things are both empty, the hundred parts become dust and grime; life and death are illusory, beginning and end are as day and night. Life and death cannot disturb this—how much less could gain and loss, fortune and misfortune, the affairs of life’s edges? They are not worth taking to heart.

To cast aside servants is like casting aside mud and mire—knowing the body is nobler than servants.
[Annotation] Knowing the body is nobler than servants, one discards them as if leaving behind dirt.
If one knows that the changes of life and death are all the self, then what is noble remains constant.
What is noble lies in the self and is not lost in change.
[Annotation] What is noble is the self, and the self moves with change, thus nothing is lost.
[Subcommentary] To cast aside servants is like treating them as mud and mire. Thus one knows nobility lies in the self, not in external things. The self moves with change, so nothing is lost.

Moreover, the ten thousand transformations have no beginning and no end—what could trouble the heart? Only one who has become the Dao understands this.
[Annotation] This is called "suspended release."
[Subcommentary] The things of the world flow and change without end. Who, following change and allowing transformation, would be burdened in heart? Only those who cultivate the Dao and attain understanding can release this.

Confucius said: "Master, your virtue matches heaven and earth, yet you still borrow these profound words to cultivate the mind. Among the noble ones of old, who could escape this?"
[Subcommentary] *Matches* means to join; *escape* means to be free. Laozi’s virtue joins with the two poles and shines with the three luminaries, thus he should forget words and return to principle, with sagely wisdom arising naturally. Yet now he expounds profound words to cultivate and guard the mind—then among the noble ones of old, who could abandon words and be free of cultivation?

Laozi said: "Not so. Water’s relation to clarity arises without effort and its nature is spontaneous. The perfected person’s relation to virtue requires no cultivation, yet things cannot depart from it—like heaven’s natural height, earth’s natural depth, the sun and moon’s natural brightness. What cultivation would there be?"
[Annotation] No cultivation, no effort, yet it is spontaneously attained.
[Subcommentary] *Clarity* refers to water’s limpid stillness. Water’s limpid stillness is spontaneous in nature; drawing from it and benefiting from it do not come from cultivation. The perfected person’s profound virtue is likewise: resting in the court of mystery, things cannot depart from it. Its blessings reach the coarse and refined, yet it is used without awareness. Like heaven’s height, earth’s depth, the sun and moon’s illumination—what cultivation is there? It is simply spontaneous.

Confucius departed and told Yan Hui: "In my relation to the Dao, I am like a vinegar gnat."
[Annotation] The vinegar gnat is the moth in the vinegar vat. Had the Master not lifted the cover from my eyes, I would not have known the great wholeness of heaven and earth.
[Annotation] My wholeness before Laozi was like the vat compared to heaven and earth.
[Subcommentary] The vinegar gnat is the moth in the vinegar vat. Always covered by the vessel, it does not see the two poles.

Just as Confucius was obscured by the sages at his side and could not perceive the principles of things—had Laozi not lifted the cover from his eyes, he would have remained ignorant of the great wholeness of heaven and earth and the wondrous Dao of empty penetration all his life.

Zhuangzi visited Duke Ai of Lu. The duke said to him: "In Lu there are many Ru scholars, but few who follow your teachings."
[Subcommentary] *Fang* means "to follow." Zhuangzi lived during the Warring States period, contemporaneous with King Hui of Wei and King Wei of Qi, one hundred twenty years after Duke Ai of Lu. His claim to have met Duke Ai is thus an allegory.
Lu was the descendant state of the Duke of Zhou and should have been a land of proper attire and ritual. Moreover, Confucius was born in Lu and vigorously promoted the teaching of the five virtues, so that his disciples numbered three thousand, all donning the robes of the Ru. In Lu, those clad in long hems and wide sleeves were many, but those who practiced the learning of non-action were few.

Zhuangzi said: "In Lu, the Ru are few."
[Subcommentary] Attire is meant to reflect virtue; it should not be changed lightly. Zhuangzi, seeing this clearly, thus mocked the scarcity of true Ru.
Duke Ai said: "The entire state of Lu wears the Ru garb—how can you say they are few?"
[Subcommentary] Duke Ai was mediocre and dull, failing to examine their Way. He merely admired their clothing and mistakenly called them many.

Zhuangzi said: "I have heard that Ru scholars wear round caps, knowing the seasons of heaven; square shoes, knowing the forms of earth; and jade pendants with loose cords, deciding matters as they arise. Those who possess the Way are not necessarily clad in its garb; those who wear its garb do not necessarily know its Way."
[Subcommentary] *Lǚ* means "square." *Huǎn* refers to multicolored silk cords threading jade pendants as ornaments. *Juē* means "to arrange in order." Some texts write it as *shòu*.
Heaven is round, earth is square—attire is meant to reflect virtue. Thus, wearing a round cap to emulate heaven, one knows the auspices of the three luminaries; wearing square shoes to model earth, one knows the water and land of the nine provinces; trailing cords and jade pendants, one arranges and decides matters as they come. Those who embody the Way need not don its garb; those who wear its garb do not necessarily embody the Way. Such people have existed from ancient times to the present—hence Zhuangzi’s allegorical discourse.

Duke Ai stubbornly disagreed. Zhuangzi said: "Why not issue a decree throughout the state: Those who lack this Way yet wear its garb shall be put to death." Thereupon, Duke Ai proclaimed this for five days, and in all of Lu, none dared wear the Ru garb.
[Subcommentary] Those who wore the garb without the Way deserved the severest punishment. With the law so strict, none dared violate it. After five days of proclamation, not a single Ru remained—
except for one man standing at the palace gate in Ru attire. The duke summoned him and questioned him on state affairs; his answers were inexhaustible, shifting a thousand ways without end.

Zhuangzi said: "In all of Lu, there is but one Ru—can this be called many?"
[Annotation] One whose virtue is full within does not adorn himself without.
[Subcommentary] The "one man" refers to Confucius. As a sage, Confucius responded to situations with wisdom like a mirror’s reflection, infinitely adaptable. Even if the whole state had but one such man, it would not be many.

Baili Xi took no heed of rank or salary, so when he fed cattle, the cattle grew fat. This made Duke Mu of Qin forget his lowly status and entrust him with governance.
[Subcommentary] Baili Xi was a worthy of Qin. Originally from Yu, when Yu was destroyed by Jin, he went to Qin. Initially unrecognized, he lived in poverty, feeding cattle. Content in his work, he became robust and carefree, unmoved by wealth or nobility. Thus, when Duke Mu learned of his worth, he entrusted him with state affairs without suspicion—hence "forgot his lowly status."

Lord Yu took no heed of life or death, so he was able to move others.
[Annotation] One who is self-contented within preserves all things without.
[Subcommentary] Lord Yu was Shun, surnamed Yao and styled Chonghua. Though tormented by his stepmother, he never let life or death weigh on his mind. His filial piety was renowned, moving heaven and earth. Thus, Yao married his two daughters to him and entrusted him with the realm—hence "able to move others."

The Lord of Yuan of Song was about to have paintings made. All the scribes arrived, received his bow, and stood in attendance. They licked their brushes and ground ink—half remained outside.

The [Subcommentary] states: The lord of Song wished to have maps drawn of the mountains, rivers, and lands within his state. All the painters arrived, received his command, bowed in acknowledgment, and stood in attendance. They mixed vermilion and ground ink, vying to display their skills. Excluding those who had received his bow, half remained outside—this shows how many were eager to compete.

There was one painter who arrived late, moving unhurriedly without haste. He received the bow but did not stand in attendance; instead, he went straight to his lodging. The lord sent someone to observe him, who saw him strip off his robes and sit cross-legged upon the tiles. The lord said, “He will do—this is a true painter.”

[Annotation] One who is inwardly sufficient possesses a spirit at ease and a mind settled.

[Subcommentary] *Zhizhi* describes a relaxed and unhurried demeanor. Being inwardly self-content, he showed no outward restraint: he walked slowly without hurrying, received the command without standing, entered his lodging directly, removed his garments, and sat bare-chested, utterly without fear. When the lord saw his spirit and bearing, he knew him to be a true painter.

King Wen observed the banks of Zang, where he saw a man fishing—but his fishing was no fishing.

[Annotation] He merely passed the years in leisure.

[Subcommentary] Zang was a place near the Wei River. The “man” was an allusion to the Grand Duke. Before Lü Wang encountered King Wen, he angled at Zang, casting his line without intent to bait, idly passing his days in carefree ease. His fishing was not fishing in the usual sense.

[Annotation] He sought nothing at all.

He fished as a matter of course.

[Annotation] He did not weigh gain or loss; his angling was but a pretense.

[Subcommentary] He did not hold his rod with the intent to covet fish. He simply wandered the banks of the Wei, passing the years as they came. King Wen wished to raise him to office and entrust him with governance, but feared his ministers, kinsmen, and elders would not accept it. He wished to abandon the idea, yet could not bear that the people should be left without a protector.

[Subcommentary] Having seen this worthy man, King Wen desired to entrust him with state affairs, but again feared that his royal kin and chief ministers would be suspicious and envious. Though he considered setting the idea aside, he could not endure that the common people should lose their shelter—hence “without a protector.”

Thereupon, at dawn, he addressed his ministers, saying: “Last night, I dreamed of a worthy man, dark-complexioned and bearded, riding a dappled horse with one red hoof. He commanded: ‘Entrust your governance to the Old Man of Zang, and the people’s afflictions may yet be eased.’”

[Subcommentary] Desiring to employ the worthy man, he framed the matter as a dream and addressed his ministers thus: “Last night, I dreamed of a worthy man, dark-complexioned and bearded, riding a dappled horse with one red hoof. He commanded me: ‘Entrust your state affairs to the Old Man of Zang. By honoring the worthy and advancing the reclusive, the people’s disorders and ailments may be cured.’” *Bo* may also be written as *qun*; the reading follows the character used.

The ministers exclaimed in alarm: “It was your late father, the former lord!”

[Subcommentary] In life, King Wen’s father, Jili, had been dark-complexioned and bearded, fond of riding dappled horses with one red hoof. The king’s dream was thus his late father’s instruction—hence their alarm.

King Wen said, “Then let us divine it.”

The ministers replied, “This is the command of the former lord. Your Majesty need not doubt it—what need is there for divination?”

[Subcommentary] This was the late lord’s decree, settled and beyond question. Divination is for resolving doubts; when there is no doubt, why divine?

Thereupon, they welcomed the Old Man of Zang and entrusted him with governance. No laws were altered, and no partial decrees were issued.

[Subcommentary] In harmony, lord and minister welcomed the Old Man and appointed him chief minister, entrusting him with state affairs. Thus, the statutes and penal codes were implemented without change, and no biased or irregular commands were issued.

After three years, King Wen surveyed the state and saw that the ranks of scholars had dissolved, their stations scattered. High officials no longer distinguished themselves by virtue, and measuring vessels dared not enter the four borders.

[Subcommentary] *Zhi* refers to ranks or boundaries, as well as lodgings for remonstrating scholars. *Yu* is a measure of six *dou* and four *sheng*. After three years of governance, customs were transformed, lord and ministers walked the Way, and none could offer admonition. The ranks of scholars were dismissed, the lodges for remonstrance dismantled. All was harmonious above and below; high officials no longer displayed their virtue. Far and near followed the same path, and measuring vessels did not enter the four borders.

When the ranks of scholars dissolved and their stations scattered, this was the unity of all.

[Annotation] This is what is meant by “blending one’s light” and “merging with the dust.”

When high officials no longer distinguished themselves by virtue, this was the unity of purpose.

[Annotation] One who is pure and self-complete sets himself apart from the common task.

When measuring vessels dared not enter the four borders, this meant the feudal lords had no divided loyalties.

[Annotation] The world trusted him, and so he could unify the standards of measurement.

[Subcommentary] When the world is of one accord, there is no competition in loyal remonstrance, and affairs proceed without division. Thus, virtue is not displayed, the five ranks keep to their stations, and the four quarters are at peace.

Thereupon, King Wen made him Grand Preceptor, faced north, and asked: “Can governance extend to the whole world?” The Old Man of Zang remained silent and did not respond. He declined with a sigh, issued his orders by morning, and fled by night, never to be heard of again.

[Annotation] One who acts does not claim the merit as his own. Thus, when the task is accomplished, he cannot but withdraw; when the affair is concluded, his name cannot but depart. Only when name departs and self withdraws can one extend governance to the whole world.

[Subcommentary] In an instant, he was appointed tutor and faced north in service, asked about the extension of governance. Without desire for glory or favor, he declined with a sigh; his intent was to efface his reputation, so he remained silent and did not respond. Having achieved fame, he withdrew, attributing success to others. Unwilling to extend his influence to the whole world, he fled and vanished. Yet Lü assisted the Zhou house, received the fief of Qi, and is recorded in the histories—he never truly fled. That he is said to have fled by night is but a parable of Zhuangzi’s.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: “Was King Wen still not sufficient?”

"Why then does he dream at all?"

[Subcommentary] Yan Yuan doubted whether King Wen had fully attained the virtue of the perfected person. The true person does not dream—why then does he dream?

Confucius said: "Silence! Say no more. King Wen fulfilled it to the utmost."

[Annotation] He entrusted all to his great officers without taking charge himself—this was fulfillment to the utmost.

"And why criticize him further? He merely followed the momentary inclinations of the people."

[Annotation] The "momentary" refers to the sentiments of the common people, the instant between awakening and unawareness. Thus King Wen followed and brought them forth, aligning with their great nature.

[Subcommentary] "Momentary" means a brief interval. "Followed" means to comply. King Wen, as a sage, fully embodied the subtleties of the Dao. You should remain silent and not trouble yourself with criticism. He simply accorded with the nature of things, aligning with the hopes of the people. In the fleeting moment between their desire to awaken and their unawareness, between hesitation and decisiveness, he employed dreams to arouse their nature—nothing strange in that.

Lie Yukou shot for Bohun Wuren, drawing the bow to its fullest draw.

[Annotation] "Fullest draw" means the arrowhead protrudes beyond the bow.

He placed a cup of water on his elbow.

[Annotation] His left hand was as steady as if bracing against stone, his right hand as if resting on a branch. When the right hand loosed the arrow, the left hand remained unaware—thus he could place a cup of water upon it.

[Subcommentary] Lie Yukou and Wuren are explained in full in the "Inner Chapters." "Fullest draw" means the arrowhead is fully nocked. "Placed" means to set down. Lie Yukou, the transcendent archer of Lu, drew the bowstring with his right hand as if resting on a branch, the arrowhead fully nocked, while his left hand was as steady as if bracing against stone. He set a cup of water on his elbow, demonstrating the utmost in stillness and swiftness.

When he loosed the arrow, it vanished without a trace.

[Annotation] The arrow departed.

The arrow had just departed, yet another vanished into obscurity. As one arrow was still in flight, the next was already nocked.

[Annotation] The arrow had just flown but not yet reached the target, yet the cup was already placed back upon the elbow—such was the marvel of his swiftness.

[Subcommentary] *Shi* means "to go." *Yao* means "layered" or "obscured." *Yu* means "to lodge" or "to place." When the bowstring was loosed and the arrow flew, another followed in layered obscurity—this is what is meant by "splitting the target and entering." As the arrow had just flown but not yet reached the mark, the cup of water was already placed back, demonstrating his swiftness. The character *yu* is also written as *yu* (corner), signifying that the round arrowhead layered upon the previous one, splitting the square target and lodging in the corner. At that moment, he was like a wooden figure.

[Annotation] The utmost in stillness.

[Subcommentary] *Xiangren* refers to wooden or clay effigies. When Lie Yukou shot, he was so utterly motionless that he resembled a figure of earth or wood.

Wuren said: "This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot."

[Subcommentary] Though your skill is refined, it remains the shooting of one with intent—it is not the shooting of one who has forgotten intent, the shooting of non-shooting.

"Have you ever shot while climbing a high mountain, treading upon perilous rocks, or standing at the edge of a hundred-*ren* abyss?"

[Subcommentary] A *ren* is seven feet; a hundred *ren* is seven hundred feet. *Ruo* means "you." This is the shooting of non-shooting.

Thereupon, Wuren ascended the high mountain, trod upon the perilous rocks, and stood at the edge of the hundred-*ren* abyss. He walked backward to the very brink, with two-tenths of his feet hanging over the void. Then he bowed to Lie Yukou and beckoned him forward.

Lie Yukou prostrated himself upon the ground, sweat streaming down to his heels.

[Subcommentary] Earlier, he had briefly explained the meaning of shooting; now, he was about to draw the bow in earnest. *Shixun* means "to step backward." *Jin* means "to yield." He climbed the towering mountain, trod upon the precarious rocks, and stood at the edge of the perilous abyss. Then, turning his back to the void, he stepped backward until two-tenths of his feet hung over empty space. Unperturbed, he drew his bow and bowed to Lie Yukou, yielding the place to him. Overcome with terror, Lie Yukou could not lift his head; he shut his eyes, prostrated himself upon the ground, and sweat poured down to his feet.

Wuren said: "The perfected person ascends to the azure heavens above, descends to the Yellow Springs below, roams to the eight directions, yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged."

[Annotation] *Huichi* means "to roam freely." When virtue fills the inner self, the spirit manifests outwardly. No matter how distant, deep, or obscure, all is illuminated. Thus, one discerns the mechanisms of safety and danger and remains serene and self-possessed.

"Now, you tremble with fear in your eyes—this bodes ill for your inner state."

[Annotation] Failing to grasp the ultimate principle, you are afraid. With fear comes great loss—how could this apply only to archery?

[Subcommentary] *Huichi* means "to roam freely." *Xun* means "fear." The person of utmost virtue is equal in measure to the vastness of space. Thus, they ascend to the azure heavens, descend to the Yellow Springs, and like the divine dragon, rise and sink without fixed abode. They roam the eight directions, yet their spirit remains unaltered. What is a thousand-*ren* abyss to them? But now, I see you trembling in your heart, your eyes dazed with fear—this bodes danger for your archery.

Jianwu asked Sunshu Ao: "You have thrice served as Prime Minister without pride, and thrice been dismissed without sorrow. At first, I doubted you, but now I see the joy in the space between your brows—how do you cultivate your mind to achieve this?"

[Subcommentary] Jianwu was a recluse. Sunshu Ao was a worthy man of Chu. *Xuxu* describes a cheerful and relaxed appearance. The enlightened are unmoved by praise or blame, unshaken by favor or disgrace. Thus, Sunshu Ao served thrice without pride and was dismissed thrice without sorrow. At first, Jianwu doubted his words, but upon observing his demeanor—cheerful and at ease—he wondered how he cultivated his mind to attain such a state.

Sunshu Ao said: "How do I surpass others? I simply accept that what comes cannot be refused, and what goes cannot be stopped. I regard gain and loss as not pertaining to me, and so I remain without sorrow. How do I surpass others?

"Moreover, how can I know whether it lies with them or with me? Does it lie with them?"

Is it absent in me? Does it lie in me? Or is it absent in them? [Annotation] Being vast and unbound, one merges with the Dao, transcending self and other—thus, what lies in them is not solely absent, nor is what lies in me solely present.

[Subcommentary] *Wang* (亡) means "to lose." Moreover, one does not know whether glory and splendor are definitively in others or in oneself. If it lies in them, then it is lost to me; if it lies in me, then it is lost to them. Since self and other are merged in the Dao, gain and loss dissolve of themselves. One is thus free to wander in leisure, to gaze in all directions—how could one have time to concern oneself with whether others are noble or base?

[Annotation] To wander in leisure and gaze in all directions is to be without fixed preference, without constraint.

[Subcommentary] *Chouchu* (踌躇) describes a state of carefree contentment; *sigu* (四顾) means to survey the eight directions. One roams boundlessly through the myriad things, moving freely through the cosmos—how could one have leisure to linger in the human world, preoccupied with questions of rank and worth? Thus, one departs without sorrow.

Confucius, hearing of this, said: "The true persons of old—sages could not sway them with persuasion, beauties could not seduce them, bandits could not plunder them, and even Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor could not befriend them."

[Annotation] Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor are but titles of merit, not the essence of merit itself. Thus, to compare titles of merit to the essence of merit is to measure a vast distance—hence, their names are not sufficient to befriend such persons.

[Subcommentary] Confucius, hearing Sunshu Ao’s words, praised his virtue and invoked the ancients to affirm such a one. The true persons of old, having plumbed the subtlest mysteries, could not be swayed by clever speech, seduced by beauty, or robbed by thieves. Even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were unworthy to be their friends.

"Death and life are great indeed, yet they bring no change to the self—how much less, then, do rank and emolument?"

[Subcommentary] Though human life renews daily, death and life are great matters, yet they do not alter the self. How much less, then, do rank and emolument occupy the mind? Such a one’s spirit passes through great mountains without obstruction, enters deep springs without getting wet, dwells in lowliness without weariness, and fills heaven and earth. Having given all to others, one’s own abundance only grows.

[Annotation] Those who cut off their flesh for the world lose both self and other as one. Those who are indifferent to others yet self-content give without diminishing themselves. Their spirit fills heaven and earth, and thus they are at home wherever they are. Being at home wherever they are, they do not diminish themselves for things but abide in the realm of self-contentment.

[Subcommentary] *Jie* (介) means "obstruction." *Ji* (既) means "exhaustively." The true person enters fire without burning, enters water without getting wet, passes through great mountains without spiritual hindrance, and dwells in lowliness without harm to their Dao. Their power harmonizes with the two poles, filling heaven and earth. They do not diminish themselves for things, and thus their abundance only grows.

The King of Chu sat with the Lord of Fan. After a short while, the King of Chu’s attendants remarked three times that Fan was no more.

[Annotation] This refers to three omens of loss.

[Subcommentary] King Wen of Chu sat with Marquis Xi of Fan to discuss alliances and covenants. Fan was a state, descended from the Duke of Zhou, located in the borders of Ji Commandery—what is now Fan County. The "three" refer to disrespect for spirits, failure to honor the worthy, and neglect of the people. Since Chu was large and Fan small, Chu harbored ambitions to annex Fan, so its attendants sought to provoke him with words.

The Lord of Fan said: "That Fan is no more does not suffice to lose what I possess."

[Annotation] This is to disregard external things.

[Subcommentary] One who attains harmony with the transformations of nature remains untroubled and fearless—truly a worthy descendant of the Duke of Zhou, a lineage unbroken in its excellence. If Fan’s loss does not suffice to lose what I possess, then Chu’s existence does not suffice to preserve its own existence.

[Annotation] What is disregarded cannot be lost; if loss is no loss, then existence is no existence. Being vast and without attachment, one abides in constant presence.

From this perspective, Fan has never truly ceased to exist, nor has Chu ever truly existed.

[Annotation] Existence and non-existence depend on where the mind is placed—ultimately, the world has no existence or non-existence.

[Subcommentary] Existence and non-existence lie in the mind’s grasp of gain and loss. Once gain and loss are dissolved, what is lost is not truly lost, and what is lost becomes present; what exists is not solely existent, and what exists may cease to be.

The *Siku* edition reads "已" for "也". The *Siku* edition reads "几" for "机". The Zhao edition omits the character "也". Wang Xiaoyu emends "之" to "中" following the main text. The *Siku*, *Shidetang*, and Zhejiang Bureau editions all read "於" for "其". The *Siku* edition reads "於" for "而". The *Siku* edition omits the character "也".

**Outer Chapters: "Knowledge Wanders North" (Chapter Twenty-Two)**

Knowledge wandered north upon the Dark Waters, ascended the Hidden Well Mound, and there by chance encountered Non-Action’s Discourse.

[Subcommentary] This chapter employs fictive names to convey meaning through allegory. The north is the realm of obscurity; water, too, lies in dim depths. "Hidden" implies profound remoteness, while "well" suggests something visible yet sunken. The luminous and mysterious Dao transcends all limits, its manifestations shifting between concealment and revelation. Thus, these words are borrowed to illuminate its truth.

Knowledge addressed Non-Action’s Discourse, saying: "I wish to ask you something:
What thoughts, what reflections lead to knowing the Dao?
What conduct, what practice lead to resting in the Dao?
What adherence, what path lead to attaining the Dao?"

[Subcommentary] These questions are posed to explore the limits of knowledge in seeking the Dao. How might one contemplate, what might one ponder, to grasp the ultimate Dao? What actions, what disciplines, allow the mind to settle into harmony with the Dao? What should one follow, what should one expound, to attain the Dao?

Three questions were asked, yet Non-Action’s Discourse gave no answer—not because he refused to answer, but because he did not know how.

[Subcommentary] "Knowledge" here means discrimination. Though three questions were posed, not one received a response. This was not because Non-Action’s Discourse withheld his answer, but because the principle itself admits no discrimination, and thus he knew not how to reply.

Failing to obtain an answer, Knowledge turned back to the south of the White Waters, ascended Fox Hesitation’s height, and there beheld Mad Qu.

Knowledge repeated his questions to Mad Qu.

[Subcommentary] White is the color of purity; south, the direction of brightness. "Hesitation" suggests lingering doubt, while "fox" implies emptiness and stillness. When questions remain unresolved, one turns inward to the south of the White Waters—shifting from being to non-being—yet uncertainty persists, and the mind, like a withered tree, runs wild in madness. Thus, the name "Mad Qu" is given to express this meaning.

Mad Qu sighed and said: "Ah! I know the answer and will tell you." Yet midway through speaking, he forgot what he intended to say.

[Subcommentary] The sigh is a response. Initially, he meant to speak, but halfway through, he forgot—this forgetting itself is the path of reflection.

Failing to obtain an answer, Knowledge returned to the Celestial Palace, where he saw the Yellow Emperor and questioned him.

The Yellow Emperor said: "Without thought, without reflection, one begins to know the Dao. Without conduct, without practice, one begins to rest in the Dao. Without adherence, without path, one begins to attain the Dao."

[Subcommentary] The Yellow Emperor embodied the Dao and profoundly understood its mysterious words, thus responding to the three questions with a single "without."

Knowledge asked the Yellow Emperor: "You and I know it, yet those two do not—who is correct?"

The Yellow Emperor said: "Non-Action’s Discourse is truly right; Mad Qu approximates it. You and I remain far from it. For those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not know—thus the sage enacts the teaching without words."

[Commentary] Allowing things to follow their own course is the teaching without words.

[Subcommentary] The true one does not know; the approximate one forgets midway. Those who remain distant do so because they claim to know. The "teaching without words" is cited from the *Laozi* as evidence.

The Dao cannot be attained—

[Commentary] The Dao resides in spontaneity; it cannot be governed by words.

[Subcommentary] "Attained" means obtained. The mysterious Dao cannot be obtained through words; to speak of obtaining it is not the Dao.

Virtue cannot be reached.

[Commentary] To not lose virtue is to be called virtuous, yet to be called virtuous is not to have reached it.

[Subcommentary] The highest virtue does not act as virtue; to act as virtue is not the ultimate virtue.

Humaneness can be enacted,

[Subcommentary] The highest humaneness has no partiality; what is now practiced as biased love is merely enactable humaneness.

Righteousness can be diminished,

[Subcommentary] True judgment does not sever or divide; what can be diminished is not the great whole.

For the great whole is simply life itself.

Ritual is mutual pretense.

[Subcommentary] Ritual emphasizes reciprocity, fostering mutual falsity. Ornamentation disrupts virtue; it is not genuine.

Thus it is said: Lose the Dao, and virtue follows; lose virtue, and humaneness follows; lose humaneness, and righteousness follows; lose righteousness, and ritual follows. Ritual is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of disorder.

[Commentary] Ritual has fixed norms, and thus arises the need for correction.

[Subcommentary] Abandoning the root to chase the branches, scattering simplicity for frivolity—when the Dao is lost and purity dissipated, ritual is enacted. Thus, the *Laozi* is cited to confirm this meaning.

Therefore, it is said: Those who practice the Dao daily diminish—

[Commentary] They diminish falsity and ornamentation.

Diminish further and further until reaching non-action; in non-action, there is nothing that is not done.

[Commentary] When ornamentation is removed and simplicity is whole, though there is action, it is not action.

[Subcommentary] Those who cultivate the Dao daily shed ornamentation. First, they diminish being; then, they diminish non-being. Both being and non-being are relinquished, reaching the non-action of neither being nor non-being. Still and unmoving, in non-action, there is nothing that is not done. This again cites the *Laozi* to reaffirm its meaning.

Now, one has already become a thing—

[Commentary] Things have lost their proper place, hence they are called "things."

To return to the root—is it not difficult?
How easy it is—only for the great person.

[Commentary] Only the great person finds it easy to return to the root. The great person embodies transformation, thus transforming things is not difficult.

[Subcommentary] Those who are inverted, their hearts dwelling in falsity, pursue the branches and forget the root, taking the Dao as a thing. If they indulge in the desire to return to the root and restore life, how can they succeed? Now, to measure the ease of returning to the origin—only the great sage can do so.

Life is the companion of death,
[Commentary] Those who understand the Dao of transformation do not see death as strange.
Death is the beginning of life—who knows its principle?
[Commentary] Each serves as the beginning of the other, so who can say which is death and which is life?
[Subcommentary] Qi gathers to form life, yet this is but the companion of death; qi scatters to bring death, yet this is but the beginning of life. Between life and death, beginning and end—who knows their order? Gathering and scattering, coming and going, transformation has no fixed pattern.

Human life is the gathering of qi; when it gathers, there is life; when it scatters, there is death.
[Commentary] Both are gathering, both are scattering.
If death and life are companions, what should I fear?
[Commentary] They arise from difference.
[Subcommentary] Qi gathers to form life, qi scatters to bring death—though gathering and scattering differ, they are the same in being qi. Thus, death and life, gathering and scattering, may be called companions. Since there is no distinction, why should there be sorrow?

Therefore, the myriad things are one.
[Subcommentary] Since life and death are not two, the principle of the myriad things must return to oneness. What they deem beautiful is called the wondrous and marvelous; what they detest is called the foul and rotten. Yet the foul and rotten transform into the wondrous and marvelous, and the wondrous and marvelous transform back into the foul and rotten. Thus it is said: the world is but a single qi.

[Commentary] Each takes what it deems beautiful as wondrous and marvelous, and what it detests as foul and rotten. Yet what they deem beautiful, I may detest; what I deem beautiful, they may detest. Thus, all share in the wondrous and marvelous, all share in the foul and rotten—how do death and life, self and other, differ?
[Subcommentary] Things have no inherent beauty or ugliness, but the heart has its preferences. What the heart deems beautiful is called wondrous and marvelous; what it detests is called foul and rotten. Yet this inverts root and branch entirely. Still, the nature of things differs, and their preferences vary: what one deems beautiful, another detests; what one detests, another may find beautiful. Thus, Mao Qiang and Lady Li are deemed beautiful by people, yet fish dive deep at the sight, and birds take flight. Here, the foul and rotten become wondrous and marvelous, and the wondrous and marvelous become foul and rotten—where is there any fixed standard of right and wrong, beauty and ugliness? Thus, the myriad things of the world are but a single harmonious qi.

Therefore, the sage values oneness.
[Subcommentary] The sage who embodies the Dao, whose wisdom is one with the myriad things, values this true oneness and merges with all realms.

Knowing said to the Yellow Emperor: "I asked Non-Action, but Non-Action did not respond to me. It was not that he would not respond—he did not know how to respond. I asked Mad Ku, who wished to tell me but did not tell me. It was not that he would not tell me—he wished to tell me but forgot. Now I ask you, and you seem to know—why are you not close to the truth?"

The Yellow Emperor said: "He is truly so because he does not know; this one seems so because he has forgotten. You and I will never be close to the truth because we know."

Mad Ku heard this and took the Yellow Emperor’s words as wise.

[Commentary] This clarifies that the natural is not something attainable through knowledge of words, and thus one must dwell in the realm beyond words. Therefore, it first sets forth the standard of non-words, then entrusts its illumination to the Yellow Emperor—so that the obscurity of the natural may be glimpsed through what can be attained.

[Subcommentary] That Non-Action, whose wondrous essence is without knowledge, is truly the Dao—while Mad Ku, who reflects inwardly and abandons words, forgets what he would say, only seems like the Dao but is not truly so. Knowing and the Yellow Emperor both employ wisdom to expound principle, so they do not approach the true Dao. Mad Ku, listening from afar, heard this assessment and thought that though the Yellow Emperor had not drawn near to the truth, he could at least speak of the profound.

Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons follow clear patterns yet do not discuss them; the myriad things fulfill their principles yet do not explain them.
[Commentary] This is why Confucius said, "I wish to be without words."
[Subcommentary] The two powers bear and sustain—this is their greatest beauty. The four seasons alternate—each has its clear pattern. The myriad things are born and completed—all rely on principle. Yet they do not speak or explain, nor do they debate.

The sage traces the beauty of Heaven and Earth and comprehends the principles of the myriad things. Therefore, the perfected person practices non-action.
[Commentary] They simply allow things to act on their own.
[Subcommentary] The sage aligns with the bearing and sustaining of the two powers and harmonizes with the birth and completion of the myriad things. Thus, their mouth utters no words, their heart engages in no action.

The great sage does not act—
[Commentary] They merely follow and allow.
Observing Heaven and Earth is what this means.
[Commentary] They observe its forms and emulate its fitting patterns, differing not from Heaven and Earth.
[Subcommentary] The great sage, the perfected person, practices non-action and non-words. Observing the bearing and sustaining of Heaven and Earth, modeling the birth and completion of the great Dao—this is what it means.

Now, that numinous brightness, that utmost refinement, harmonizes with the hundred transformations.
[Commentary] The hundred transformations transform themselves, and the numinous brightness does not interfere.
[Subcommentary] That spiritually luminous, utmost refinement blends with things, flowing with their transformations—now gathering, now scattering, without joy or sorrow. When it speaks of hundreds, thousands, or ten thousands, it is merely summarizing the great outlines.

Things have their death and life, their square and round—yet none know their root.
[Commentary] The dead have already died on their own, the living have already lived on their own; the round have already become round on their own, the square have already become square on their own. There is no root that makes them so—thus, none know it.

The myriad things now live, now die, now square, now round—transforming naturally, none know their root or thread. Yet all things have existed of themselves since ancient times, steadfast and sure.

[Commentary] Do they wait to be made before they exist?

[Subcommentary] *Biǎnrán* describes their narrow, constrained arising. All things flutter forth, growing and nurturing in their time, existing of themselves since antiquity, never needing intent to bring them into being. The Six Directions are vast, yet they do not depart from its bounds.

[Commentary] To reckon the Six Directions within the boundless is to belittle them.

The tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet it awaits this to form its body.

[Commentary] Though the autumn hair is small, it is not nothing—nor is there anything that cannot contain its essence.

[Subcommentary] The Six Directions are heaven, earth, and the four quarters. When beasts encounter autumn’s scene, fine hairs sprout at the tips of their fur—these, at their most delicate, are called autumn hairs. Vast though the Six Directions may be, they still dwell within the utmost Dao. Minute though the hair-tip may be, it relies on the Dao to form its substance. Under heaven, none do not sink and float, yet throughout their lives, nothing remains fixed.

[Commentary] All is ever new.

[Subcommentary] The ten thousand things under heaven—none do not float and sink, rise and fall, live and die, come and go without cease. Their movement never halts, ever renewing in succession, never clinging to the old. Yin and yang, the four seasons, move in their courses, each attaining its proper order.

[Commentary] They do not wait to be made.

[Subcommentary] The two qi intermingle, the four seasons turn in their cycles—spring and autumn, cold and heat follow one another in natural sequence. Do they wait to be made before they proceed? Dimly, as if lost yet present,

[Commentary] To be brightly manifest as present is to be lost.

[Subcommentary] Obscurely, as if veiled—seemingly absent, yet present. Effortlessly, without form yet spirit,

[Commentary] To be rigidly formed is to lack spirit.

[Subcommentary] Spirit speaks to the wondrousness of the ten thousand things. Effortlessly unbound, without visible form, its spiritual workings are without limit. The ten thousand things are nurtured, yet none know it. This is called the root,

[Commentary] They are nurtured yet do not grasp the root of their original nature—thus, they do not know by what they are nurtured.

[Subcommentary] It sustains and nourishes all life, rearing the ten thousand things, its mysterious power subtly pervading all—yet in daily use, none know it. This true power is the one root of the utmost Dao. By this, one may observe Heaven.

[Commentary] To observe in unity with Heaven.

[Subcommentary] To observe is to perceive. Heaven is nature. One who penetrates principle and fathoms the mysterious, who recognizes the root and knows the origin—such a one may be said to observe the utmost Dao of nature.

Nie Que asked the Way of Pi Yi. Pi Yi said: "Correct your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of Heaven will come to you."

[Subcommentary] Nie Que was a disciple of Wang Ni; Pi Yi was Wang Ni’s teacher. If your bearing is upright and refined, never straying into crookedness, if your seeing and hearing remain pure and undivided, not grasping at manifold phenomena, then the natural harmony of principle will return and settle within you.

"Gather in your knowledge, unify your judgment, and spirit will come to dwell in you."

[Subcommentary] Collect and restrain the private mind, making it even and equal; focus and unify your judgment, allowing no dissipation. Then your spirit will naturally come to abide within you.

"Virtue will adorn you with beauty, and the Dao will make its home in you."

[Subcommentary] Profound and mysterious, supreme virtue will flourish in you with great beauty; the boundless Dao will reside within your heart.

"You will gaze blankly like a newborn calf, without seeking after causes."

[Subcommentary] To gaze blankly is to look without knowing, with direct and unclouded vision. Causes are affairs. When the mind is empty and at ease, one’s gaze becomes level and straightforward—thus, like a newborn calf, one seeks nothing from affairs.

Before the words were finished, Nie Que fell asleep. Pi Yi rejoiced greatly, singing as he departed.

[Subcommentary] Before the discourse on the profound had concluded, this man had already awakened—sitting in forgetfulness, he merged with the Dao, his state no different from sleep. Thereupon, Pi Yi leapt with joy, praising his swift comprehension. Walking along the great Way, he sang as he departed:

"Your form like withered bones,
Your heart like dead ashes,
True in its genuine knowing,
Not clinging to affairs to sustain itself."

[Annotation] Moving as one with transformation.

[Subcommentary] The body like the frame of a withered tree, the heart akin to cold ashes—devoid of emotion, it simply follows the unadulterated truth of genuine knowing, not holding itself to affairs with self-importance.

"Vague and obscure, dim and dusky,
Without mind, one cannot be schemed with.
What manner of man is he?"

[Annotation] One who transforms alone.

[Subcommentary] Vague and obscure, dim and dusky—extinguishing perception, relinquishing clarity, forgetting mind and knowledge, beyond all plotting. Not within the grasp of subtle insight, hence the question: *What manner of man is he?*

All from *"Your form like withered bones"* onward comprises Pi Yi’s song.

Shun asked Cheng, "Can the Dao be possessed and held?"

[Subcommentary] Cheng was an ancient perfected one, Shun’s teacher. The supreme Dao is empty and all-pervading, giving rise to the movement and stillness of all things—yet Shun wondered whether this Dao could be found within his own body. Having encountered his master, he thus posed his inquiry.

Cheng replied, "Your body is not your own—how could you possess the Dao?"

[Annotation] The body is not something you can possess; it arises of itself, a mere clod of earth. If the body is not yours to own, how much less the Dao?

[Subcommentary] The Dao transcends the four propositions and eludes the hundred negations. If even your body is not yours to possess, how could you claim the Dao?

Shun said, "If my body is not my own, then who possesses it?"

[Subcommentary] Not yet awakened to the fact that life arises from spontaneity and form from the workings of creation, he asked, *"If my body is not mine, then who possesses it?"*

Cheng replied, "It is the form bestowed by Heaven and Earth.
Life is not your own—it is the harmony bestowed by Heaven and Earth.
Nature and destiny are not your own—they are the compliance bestowed by Heaven and Earth."

[Annotation] If the body were yours to possess, then beauty and ugliness, life and death, would be subject to your control. Yet when qi flows eastward and gives rise to life, you cannot forbid it; when qi scatters and brings death, you cannot prevent it. Clearly, it gathers and forms of itself—it is not yours to possess.

[Subcommentary] *Bestowed* means gathered and formed. The yin and yang of Heaven and Earth, the gathering of hard and soft, harmonious and compliant qi—these constitute your body, nature, and destiny. Thus, when they gather, there is life; when they scatter, there is death. Since life and death, gathering and scattering do not depend on you, how can you claim your body as your own?

"Your descendants are not your own—they are the moltings bestowed by Heaven and Earth."

[Annotation] Qi gathers and sheds of itself, like a cicada’s molting.

[Subcommentary] Yin and yang gather, and thus there are descendants—transforming alone, like the shedding of a cicada’s skin.

"In walking, you know not where you go;
In dwelling, you know not what you hold;
In eating, you know not what you taste."

[Annotation] All arise spontaneously within you, hence you do not know.

[Subcommentary] Walking, dwelling, eating, tasting—all follow nature. Tracing their source, none knows whence they come. Who walks? Who dwells? Who eats? Who tastes? None knows the origin, yet all arise spontaneously.

"It is the strong yang qi of Heaven and Earth—how could you possess it?"

[Annotation] *Strong yang* refers to movement. This makes clear that the Dao may be used to relinquish the body and set the mind on life.

[Subcommentary] *Strong yang* means movement. *Hu* means "how." Body, nature, descendants—all are formed by the gathering of the moving qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. How, then, could you claim to possess this body?

Confucius asked Lao Cong, "Today, at leisure, I dare to inquire about the perfection of talent and the Dao."

[Subcommentary] *At leisure* means at ease. Confucius studied under Laozi, and thus, during a moment of quiet repose, he questioned him about the profound Dao.

Lao Cong replied, "Purify your conduct through fasting, dredge your mind through emptiness, cleanse your spirit through clarity, and strike away your knowledge. The Dao—how recondite and difficult to speak of! I shall tell you its broad outlines."

[Subcommentary] *Dredging the mind* (疏沦) is like washing and rinsing. *Cleansing the spirit* (澡雪) is like purifying and refining. *Er* (而) means "you." *Striking away* (拾击) means shattering. *Yá* (崖) means division. If you wish to inquire about the Dao, you must first fast to escape the mind, be vigilant in reverence and sincerity, wash and rinse body and mind, purify and still the spirit and consciousness, shatter sagely wisdom, and sweep away emptiness and ease. Yet the profound Dao is obscure and dark, difficult to speak of in detail. I shall thus present its divisions and speak of it roughly.

The luminous arises from the obscure, the ordered from the formless, the spirit from the Dao.

[Annotation] All these illustrate its solitary generation, without reliance on anything else.

The physical form originates from essence.

[Annotation] All proceed from essence to the coarse.

[Subcommentary] *Lún* (伦) means principle. The bright and manifest arises from the obscure and dark; human order and activity emerge from the formless; the mind of spirit, wisdom, and consciousness arises from the profound Dao; and the realm of form, substance, and qi takes essence as its root. Yet all things generate one another through form, so creatures with nine orifices are born from the womb, while those with eight are born from eggs.

[Annotation] Though things generate one another through form, this too is natural. Thus, womb-born and egg-born creatures cannot exchange their modes of birth, demonstrating that spirit and qi cannot be manipulated.

[Subcommentary] The formless Dao can generate the formed, while formed things generate one another through form, substance, and qi. Thus, humans, with nine orifices, are womb-born, while birds and fish, with eight, are egg-born—all received naturally and cannot be altered. Its coming has no nearness, its going no boundary, no gate, no chamber, yet it is vast and all-pervading.

[Annotation] Those who follow their natural nature and wander the pathless way release their forms amid Heaven and Earth and lodge their spirits beyond the eight directions. Thus, without gate or chamber, it is vast and all-pervading, roaming the six directions and moving in harmony with transformation.

[Subcommentary] *Huáng* (皇) means great. Taking non-arrival as arrival, though it comes, it leaves no trace; taking non-departure as departure, though it goes, it has no boundary. Thus, it enters and exits without doors, comes and goes without edges, and so can be vast and reach the four directions, connecting all things. Those who encounter this have strong limbs, penetrating thoughts, keen ears and eyes, effortless application of the mind, and boundless responsiveness to things.

[Annotation] Those born and meeting this Dao have their heavenly nature preserved and their spirit settled.

[Subcommentary] *Yáo* (邀) means encounter. *Xùn* (徇) means penetration. Those who encounter the Dao and align with true principle have sound bodies, strong and healthy limbs, penetrating thoughts, sharp hearing and vision, a mindless mind that labors not, and a response without response that answers without fixed place.

Heaven cannot but be high, Earth cannot but be vast, the sun and moon cannot but move, and the myriad things cannot but flourish—this is the Dao.

[Annotation] All these cannot but be so naturally, not because the Dao compels them.

[Subcommentary] The Two Modes rely on the profound Dao for their height and breadth, the Three Luminaries depend on it for their movement, and the ten thousand things attain flourishing through it—such is the Dao’s power. Thus, the *Laozi* says: Heaven attains the One and becomes clear, Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil, the myriad things attain the One and live—this is what is meant.

Moreover, extensive study does not necessarily bring knowledge, eloquence does not necessarily bring wisdom—sages have already severed such notions.

[Annotation] They sever knowledge and wisdom, entrusting all to nature.

[Subcommentary] Broad study of the classics does not necessarily lead to true knowledge; grand eloquence and adorned words do not necessarily bring wisdom and illumination. Thus, the *Laozi* says: The good do not argue, the argumentative are not good; the knowing are not learned, the learned do not know. Sages have already severed and abandoned these.

As for that which, when augmented, is not increased, and when diminished, is not reduced—this is what sages preserve.

[Annotation] They simply preserve their proper allotment, thus having no use for knowledge and wisdom.

[Subcommentary] Broad knowledge and eloquence do not increase clarity; silence and facing the wall do not diminish it. This is what is called neither increasing nor decreasing, neither harming nor benefiting—sages’ wondrous embodiment, which they preserve and cherish.

Deep and still like the sea,

[Annotation] Its capacity is boundless.

[Subcommentary] Though its tail leaks, it is not exhausted; though a hundred rivers pour into it, it does not increase—profound, clear, deep, and vast, thus likened to the profound Dao.

Vast and towering, it ends yet begins again,

[Annotation] Those who move with transformation accumulate boundless eons—this may be called towering.

[Subcommentary] *Wēiwēi* (巍巍) means lofty and great. The Dao surpasses the Great One in remoteness and transcends the Two Modes in nearness, encompassing the boundless. Thus, it is praised as towering. Ending yet beginning again—this clarifies that it has no end or beginning, daily renewing in transformation, ungraspable in following or meeting.

It measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion.

[Annotation] It uses things without being enslaved by them, thus it is not exhausted.

Then the Dao of the noble person—is it external?

[Annotation] Each takes from themselves and is sufficient.

[Subcommentary] That which carries and sustains the myriad things, its capacity inexhaustible, pervading the boundless without depletion—this is the Dao of the noble person. It is not distant; it lies near, within the heart. Since it does not depend on external receipt, how could it be external?

The myriad things all turn to it for sustenance without exhaustion—this is the Dao.

[Annotation] It returns to using things, thus I am not exhausted. This clarifies that the Dao’s provision for things lies in not providing—by not providing, things attain themselves. Thus, it is said: this is the Dao.

This speaks of the Dao’s non-action; only non-action is worthy of being called the Dao.

The myriad beings, whether sentient or insentient, all receive this mysterious Dao; yet the mysterious workings subtly pervade all without ever being exhausted. Now, the Dao and things are neither one nor different, yet apart from the Dao there are no things—thus it is said: this is the Dao.

Within the Central Kingdom there is a kind of person who is neither yin nor yang,
[Annotation] Without partial designation.
dwelling between Heaven and Earth, simply being human,
[Annotation] Unrestrained and self-directed, content with whatever comes, utterly without fame or achievement.
[Subcommentary] The Central Kingdom—does this mean the Nine Provinces? The Dao observed by such a person is neither yin nor yang, neither soft nor hard, neither short nor long; thus it transcends the four propositions and leaves behind the hundred negations. Dwelling between Heaven and Earth, simply placed as human, without partiality—*zhi* (置) here may also be read as *zhi* (值), meaning that within the world, one encounters being human yet remains entirely unentangled.

They return to the Source.
[Annotation] Originally following the branches.
[Subcommentary] Free from partiality, simply placed as human, they can return to the root and revert to the Origin.

Viewed from the root, the living are but congealed things.
[Annotation] Merely gathered qi.
[Subcommentary] The root is the Dao. *Hāi-yī* (哈噫) means the gathering of qi. Observed from the Dao, the living are but things formed of congealed qi—how could they be worth cherishing? Though there be long life or early death, how great is the difference? This is but the discourse of a fleeting moment. How could it suffice to distinguish between Yao and Jie as right or wrong?
[Annotation] If even life and death are not truly distinct, how much less the difference between long life and early death?
[Subcommentary] Within a single lifetime, within a hundred years, whether long-lived or short-lived, how much difference is there? It is but the span of a moment, the discourse of an instant—how could it suffice to affirm Yao or condemn Jie and make distinctions between them?

Fruits and melons have their principles,
[Annotation] All things have their principles; one should simply follow them.
and though human relations are difficult, they have their proper order.
[Annotation] Human relations involve the changes of wisdom and cunning, hence their difficulty. Yet their wisdom and cunning naturally order themselves—one should simply follow and let them be.
[Subcommentary] Those on trees are called *guǒ* (果), those on the ground *guā* (瓜). Peaches, plums, gourds, and calabashes—whether born of wood or vine—all have their principles. Human life in the world is perilous and arduous, yet noble and base, honored and humble, follow one another in proper sequence. One should simply let them be, naturally aligning with the Dao, just as fruits and melons have their inherent principles.

The sage meets them without resistance,
[Annotation] Following whatever is encountered.
and passes beyond them without clinging.
[Annotation] Passing beyond what ought to be passed beyond.
[Subcommentary] Encountering eminence and rank, he does not resist; having passed beyond them, he does not linger.

Harmonizing and responding—this is virtue;
coinciding and responding—this is the Dao.
[Annotation] *Tiáo* (調) and *ǒu* (偶) mean harmonizing and coinciding.
[Subcommentary] Harmonizing with the myriad things and responding—this is supreme virtue; coinciding with circumstances and responding to the moment—this is the sagely Dao.

This is how emperors arise and kings emerge.
[Annotation] It is no more than this.
[Subcommentary] When emperors and kings arise, they respond to the myriad beings by harmonizing and coinciding with the times, meeting things as they come.

Human life between Heaven and Earth is like a white colt passing a chink—suddenly, it is gone.
[Annotation] Not worth cherishing.
[Subcommentary] The white colt is a swift steed, or else the sun. The chink is an opening. Human life in the world is but a fleeting moment, so pressing and brief—like a galloping steed passing a narrow gap, vanishing in an instant. How could it be worth mentioning?

All things surge forth in tumult;
all things drift and settle in stillness.

The terms "emergence" and "return" refer to transformation—nothing in the world remains unchanging.
[Annotation] "Surging forth" describes the appearance of life; "drifting and settling" depicts the state of death. All things in the world, without exception, arise from transformation and follow it into death. Having transformed into life, they transform again into death.
[Annotation] Both are transformations. Living beings lament this;
[Annotation] dead beings do not lament. Humankind grieves over it;
[Annotation] the dead do not grieve.
[Subcommentary] Life and death come and go, meeting in transformation. Entrusting this to the Creator, why cling to it? Thus, when death comes, living beings and humankind share in mourning, but those who are neither living nor of the same kind do not mourn or grieve. Release the bonds of nature, cast off its wrappings—
[Annotation] to be uniquely free.
[Subcommentary] *Jie* means to conceal; *guo* means to bind. People cling to right and wrong, rejoice in life and fear death, thus becoming bound by life and death. Now, having unified right and wrong and forgotten life and death, they naturally dissolve the fetters of nature.

In swirling, winding flux,
[Annotation] the intertwining of transformation—
the soul departs, and the body follows, thus returning to the Great Return.
[Annotation] Do not exert the mind between them.
[Subcommentary] "Swirling, winding" describes the state of dispersion. The soul ascends to Heaven, bones and flesh return to earth, spirit and qi scatter—freely following the flux, passing from being to non-being, this is the Great Return.

The formless takes form; form returns to the formless.
[Annotation] Only when formless does form truly arise; if one imposes form upon it, one ruins its form.
[Subcommentary] Before birth, humans inherently lack form, thus originating from the formless. Qi gathers to give rise to form; qi disperses to return to the formless. This is universally known.
[Annotation] Though known, people cannot allow it to take form naturally but instead impose form upon it, thus often ruining it. It is not the concern of those who have attained the Way.
[Annotation] Concern prevents attainment.
[Subcommentary] The transition from formless to form, and from form back to formlessness, is universally known. Yet this is but a mundane matter, not the true pursuit of those who have reached the ultimate. This is what the common people universally discuss.
[Annotation] Though they discuss it, they still cannot refrain from concern, thus failing to attain it.
[Subcommentary] The presence and absence of form, the coming and going of life and death—these are what the common people universally discuss. Those who have attained the Way do not discuss it;
[Annotation] only in effortless, unknowing awareness do they attain it. To discuss it is to fail to attain it.
[Subcommentary] The sagely ones, having forgotten words and grasped the principle, engage in no discussion. If they were to discuss it, they would not reach the Dao.

To perceive clearly is to miss the mark;
[Annotation] only upon hearing the ultimate does one truly encounter it.
[Subcommentary] *Zhi* means to meet or encounter. Those who close their wisdom and block their senses, merging obscurely with the mysterious principle—if they seek clarity, they will not attain the truth. Eloquence is inferior to silence. The Dao cannot be heard; hearing is inferior to blocking. This is called the Great Attainment.
[Annotation] In silence and blocking, there is nothing to pursue, thus the Great Attainment.
[Subcommentary] Excessive eloquence and adorned words distance one from the truth; forgetting words and abiding in stillness bring one closer to the mysterious Dao. Thus, the Dao cannot be sought through much hearing; seeking through hearing is inferior to blocking. Those who profoundly grasp this meaning may be said to have deeply attained the Great Principle.

Master Dongguo asked Zhuangzi: "Where does the so-called Dao reside?"
[Subcommentary] Dwelling in Dongguo, he was called Master Dongguo—teacher of Wuze, who was in turn the master of Dongguo Shunzi. He asked Zhuangzi: "Where does the all-pervading, empty Dao reside?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is nowhere absent."
[Subcommentary] The Dao is boundless; it is present everywhere.
Master Dongguo said: "Specify it, then it may be known."
[Annotation] He wished Zhuangzi to name its location.
[Subcommentary] The commentary states: He wished Zhuangzi to name its location.
Zhuangzi said: "It is in the ants."
He said: "Why so lowly?"
"It is in the millet stalks."
"Why even lower?"
"It is in the tiles and shards."
"Why still lower?"
"It is in excrement and urine."
Master Dongguo did not respond.
[Subcommentary] The Great Dao is nowhere absent, yet where it resides, it is nowhere to be found. Thus, it is present everywhere, undiscriminating of purity or filth. Master Dongguo, not grasping this subtlety, believed the Dao to be lofty and pure. When told it resided in tiles and shards, he already found it too base; hearing of excrement and urine, he grew indignant and did not respond.
Zhuangzi said: "Your question fundamentally misses the essence."
[Annotation] By naming its location, you speak of its manifestations, yet you still find fault with this—this is missing the essence.
[Subcommentary] The Dao is nowhere absent; how could it reside only in millet stalks? Your question fundamentally fails to reach the truth.

The question posed to the market inspector about treading on pigs to assess their fatness—each step lower reveals more.
[Annotation] *Xi* refers to large pigs. The market inspector treads on pigs to determine their fatness; the more he treads on the harder-to-fatten parts, the better he knows the key to the pig's fatness. Now, in seeking the Dao's abode, each inquiry into lower, baser places confirms all the more that the Dao does not escape from things.
[Subcommentary] *Zheng* is an official title, equivalent to today's market commissioner. *Huo* is a name. *Jian* refers to the market overseer, equivalent to today's butcher. *Xi* means pig. Now, when asking a butcher about the method of buying pigs, one is told: treading on the pig's thighs and legs—the harder-to-fatten parts—reveals the pig's fatness all the more. Why is this?

Where the lower, harder-to-fatten parts bear flesh, one knows full well the easier-to-fatten parts are thick with fat. Just so, where the Dao abides in lowly places like excrement and urine, it is clear that all pure and empty realms are equally pervaded.

You must not insist—nowhere does it escape from things.
[Annotation] If one insists that the Dao escapes from things, then the Dao is not all-encompassing. A Dao that is not all-encompassing is not truly the Dao.

[Subcommentary] *Wu* means "non-action" in the Way. The great Dao is vast and boundless, governing all without exception. You must not say that the ultimate Dao abandons things. If it were to escape from things, how could it be all-pervading? What holds true for the ultimate Dao also holds for grand teachings.

[Annotation] This clarifies that the Dao does not escape from things.

[Subcommentary] The ultimate Dao is principle; grand teachings are instruction. Since principle does not escape from things, instruction likewise is universally pervading and impartial. *Zhou*, *pian*, and *xian*—though their names differ, their essence is one, and their meaning is the same.

[Subcommentary] *Zhou* means all-pervading and complete; *xian* means all things possess the Dao. This further clarifies that the ultimate Dao does not escape from things. Though the three terms differ in name, in essence and principle they converge as one.

Once we wandered together in the Palace of Nothing-Whatsoever, harmonized in discussion, without end or limit.
[Annotation] If one wanders in what *is*, one cannot be all-pervading and complete. Only by harmonizing in discussion does one realize the Dao is present everywhere. Realizing the Dao is present everywhere, one can then roam boundlessly without attachment.

[Subcommentary] The Palace of Nothing-Whatsoever refers to the abode of the mysterious Dao—where not a single thing exists, hence "nothing-whatsoever." The three—*zhou*, *pian*, and *xian*—roam together in the realm of the ultimate Dao. Since their essential meaning is one, they harmonize in discussion, merging with the profound principle, thus without beginning or end.

Once we practiced non-action together—serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease.
[Annotation] All this arises from non-action.

[Subcommentary] This summarizes the three virtues of *zhou*, *pian*, and *xian*—their abundant power and flourishing virtue. Having roamed in the realm of the ultimate Dao and dwelled in the domain of non-action, they are thus tranquil and still, silent and clear, gentle and harmonious, spacious and at ease.

My will is now desolate,
[Annotation] Desolate, empty, and void.

[Subcommentary] The sage who attains the Dao merges with principle and the profound truth; his nature and will are vast and desolate.

I go nowhere yet do not know where I arrive.
[Annotation] If the will is desolate, then there is nowhere to go. Going nowhere, one goes yet does not know where one arrives. If there is somewhere to go, then before principle moves, the will has already arrived.

I depart and return yet do not know where I rest.
[Annotation] This is following the natural course.

[Subcommentary] Since the words are desolate, one comes and goes without return. Even if one does not go yet goes, does not come yet comes, there is ultimately no place of arrival or resting.

I have come and gone yet do not know where it ends.
[Annotation] One comes and goes not through knowledge, yet this does not mean one does not come and go. Coming and going are the constant principle of nature—can there be an end?

[Subcommentary] Even if one comes and goes with creation, lives and dies, follows change and submits to transformation, one does not know the beginning or end.

I wander in boundless vastness—great knowledge enters yet does not know where it ends.
[Annotation] Boundless vastness refers to emptiness and openness. Great knowledge, through this vast emptiness, freely knows the transformations—hence it does not know.

[Subcommentary] *Panghuang* means to roam freely; *feng hong* describes a vast and open appearance, referring to the merging of understanding. The person of great wisdom merges with the desolate and boundless principle, thus roaming freely and at ease, without limit.

The one who gives things their thingness has no boundary with things.
[Annotation] This clarifies that the one who gives things their thingness is not a thing—things are themselves things. Things are themselves things, hence they are obscure.

[Subcommentary] *Ji* means boundary. The one who gives things their thingness is the sage. The sage is obscurely one with the myriad things, thus having no boundary of self and other with things.

Yet things have boundaries—what are called the boundaries of things.
[Annotation] Things have boundaries, thus they cannot be obscurely one with each other—this is what is truly meant by boundaries.

[Subcommentary] The emotions of things discriminate and make endless choices, hence there are boundaries between self and other.

The boundary of no-boundary is the boundary that is no boundary.
[Annotation] The one without boundary, though called the one who gives things their thingness, merely clarifies that things are themselves things. The one who gives things their thingness is ultimately no thing—where is the boundary?

[Subcommentary] The boundary that is no boundary is the enlightened view of the sage; the no-boundary that is a boundary is the stagnant emotion of the vulgar. It is said: fullness and emptiness, decline and death—what is fullness and emptiness is not fullness and emptiness; what is decline and death is not decline and death; what is beginning and end is not beginning and end; what is accumulation and dispersal is not accumulation and dispersal.

[Annotation] Having clarified that the one who gives things their thingness is no thing, and that things cannot give themselves their thingness, then who is the doer? All is suddenly and spontaneously so.

[Subcommentary] Wealth and nobility are fullness; poverty and lowliness are emptiness. Old age and sickness are decline and death; beginning and end are root and branch. Coming to life is accumulation; death is dispersal. The one who gives things their thingness is not a thing—then who gives life to things? This clarifies that the one who gives and what is given are both not so. If things are not things, how can one speak of fullness and emptiness, decline and death? Thus it is known that what is called fullness and emptiness is not truly fullness and emptiness. As the *Western Ascension Scripture* says: "If one can understand this, what is affirmed is reversed and negated."

He and Gan of the He clan studied together with Old Dragon Ji under Shen Nong.
[Subcommentary] His surname was He, his given name Gan. Shen Nong here is not the Shen Nong of the Three Sovereigns but a later figure.

The two studied together under Old Dragon Ji. Old Dragon Ji was also a style name. Shen Nong leaned on his armrest with the door closed, napping in the daytime. He Gan thrust open the door at midday and entered, saying: "Old Dragon is dead."

[Subcommentary] *Yin* means to lean; *he* means to close. *Yao* means to open, also to push. Those who study the Dao concentrate their spirit and settle their minds, closing the door to lean on the armrest, guarding silence in stillness. When He Gan heard of his teacher’s death, he pushed open the door to announce it.

Shen Nong leaned on his staff and rose, then suddenly let go of the staff and laughed.

[Annotation] He rose and realized that death was not worth alarm, so he set down the staff and laughed.

[Subcommentary] *Pùrán* is the sound of the staff being set down. Shen Nong was startled by the news of Ji’s death, so he grasped his staff in alarm; then, reflecting that death was not cause for sorrow, he set it down and laughed.

He said: "Heaven knew my perversity, coarseness, arrogance, and carelessness, so it cast me aside and let him die. Alas, Master! You died without ever unleashing my wild words."

[Annotation] From Jian Wu downward, all took the ultimate words as madness and did not believe them. Thus, apart from Old Dragon’s disciples like Lian Shu, none were fit to speak with.

[Subcommentary] *Master* refers to Old Dragon Ji. He had the virtue of spontaneity, so he was called *Heaven*. *Wild words* are the ultimate words—beyond the comprehension of ordinary people, hence called *wild*. The teacher knew my stubbornness, vulgarity, arrogance, and inattention, so he abandoned our company and ceased in death. With the wise man gone, the ultimate words are cut off; no one remains to discourse on the profound or instruct me, to open my heart.

Yin Gang, upon hearing this, said: "Those who embody the Dao are what the noble ones of the world depend upon."

[Annotation] Those who embody the Dao are the masters of humanity. Yet in matters of the Dao, they have not attained even one ten-thousandth of the tip of an autumn hair.

[Annotation] The tip of an autumn hair is already minute, and they have not attained even one ten-thousandth of it. Yet they still know to conceal their wild words and die—how much more so for those who truly embody the Dao?

[Annotation] This makes clear that the ultimate Dao cannot be attained through words; it lies only in personal realization.

[Subcommentary] His surname was Na, his given name Gang; he was a recluse. *Depend* means to attach or rely upon. Upon hearing of Old Dragon Ji’s death, he offered this reflection: Those who embody the Dao are revered by the world; the worthy and noble attach themselves to them. Yet Old Dragon, in relation to the profound Dao, had not attained even one ten-thousandth of the tip of a hair. Even so, he knew to conceal his unbridled words and depart in accordance with fate—how much less would one of subtle awakening reveal his teachings? Thus, those who embody the Dao in profound mystery, who forget words and merge with principle, are exceedingly rare. It has no form to see, no sound to hear; in the discourse of men, it is called *obscure*—yet even so, to speak of the Dao is not the Dao.

[Annotation] That it is called *obscure* yet still not the Dao makes clear that the Dao is nameless.

[Subcommentary] The profound Dao is empty and vast, its wondrous essence beyond form and sound, beyond seeing and hearing. Thus, when scholars discuss it, they call it *obscure*—yet even this is not the true Dao.

Then Tai Qing asked Wu Qiong: "Do you know the Dao?"

Wu Qiong said: "I do not know."

He also asked Wu Wei.

Wu Wei said: "I know the Dao."

Tai Qing said: "In your knowing the Dao, is there a reckoning?"

Wu Wei said: "There is."

Tai Qing said: "What is this reckoning?"

[Subcommentary] Since you know the Dao, does it have a name or number? What is this reckoning? Please explain briefly.

Wu Wei said: "I know the Dao can be noble, can be base, can be gathered, can be dispersed—this is the reckoning by which I know the Dao."

[Subcommentary] Noble as an emperor, base as a servant; gathered as life, dispersed as death—its reckoning is boundless. This is but a rough explanation, meant to show that it is named yet not named, numbered yet not numbered.

Tai Qing then asked Wu Shi: "If this is so, then between Wu Qiong’s not knowing and Wu Wei’s knowing, which is right and which is wrong?"

[Subcommentary] The ultimate Dao is profoundly penetrating, serene and without action, unfathomable in its response, without end or beginning—hence the names *Wu Qiong* and *Wu Shi* are borrowed for it. Between Wu Qiong’s not knowing and Wu Wei’s knowing, which is right and which is wrong? Please judge their merits.

Wu Shi said: "Not knowing is deep; knowing is shallow. Not knowing is within; knowing is without."

[Subcommentary] Not knowing accords with principle, so it is profoundly abstruse and resides within; knowing deviates from the Dao, so it is coarse and shallow, and lies without.

Thereupon Tai Qing sighed in the midst of this and said: "Is not knowing then knowing? Is knowing then not knowing?"

Who knows the knowing of not-knowing?
[Annotation] To attain it is not through knowing, but through profound obscurity.
[Subcommentary] Tai Qing, grasping the middle Way, sighed in realization: not-knowing is true knowing. Who knows the knowing of not-knowing? This reveals how rare true knowing is.

Wu Shi said: The Dao cannot be heard; to hear it is not it. The Dao cannot be seen; to see it is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken; to speak it is not it.
[Annotation] Only by dwelling in the realm of neither hearing nor seeing does one reach it.
[Subcommentary] The Dao has no sound, so it cannot be heard by the ear—what the ear hears is not the Dao. The Dao has no form, so it cannot be seen by the eye—what the eye sees is not the Dao. The Dao has no name, so it cannot be spoken—what is spoken is not the Dao.

Know that what gives form to forms is itself formless.
[Annotation] Forms form themselves; what gives form to forms is ultimately no-thing.
[Subcommentary] That which gives form to the ten thousand things is itself not form—hence it is said that what gives form to forms is formless.

The Dao should not be named.
[Annotation] Though the Dao is named, it is ultimately no-thing, so the name cannot be fitting.
[Subcommentary] Names have no power to attain the Dao, and the Dao has no reality corresponding to names—thus to name the Dao is mistaken.

Wu Shi said: One who answers when asked about the Dao does not know the Dao. Even the one who asks about the Dao has not heard the Dao.
[Annotation] To ask is to not know; to answer when asked is not the Dao. Not to answer is not what the questioner can grasp, so even if asked, one ultimately does not hear it.
[Subcommentary] The Dao transcends names and words, so it cannot be questioned or answered. Thus, both asking and answering about the Dao show ignorance.

The Dao admits no questions; questions admit no answers.
[Annotation] This is the meaning of abandoning learning and teaching to return to naturalness.
[Subcommentary] One who embodies the Dao is beyond words—what questions or answers could there be? This passage further explains the preceding text.

To question where there is no question is to question emptiness.
[Annotation] This is what is meant by valuing emptiness.
[Subcommentary] *Qiong* means emptiness. To insist on questioning where there is no principle to question is to value emptiness.

To answer where there is no answer is to be without inwardness.
[Annotation] To feign existence where there is none is to be external.
[Subcommentary] To insist on answering where there is no principle to answer is to become estranged from truth.

One who meets the questioning of emptiness with the absence of inwardness—such a one outwardly does not observe the cosmos, inwardly does not know the Great Beginning.
[Subcommentary] *Yu* refers to the four directions of heaven and earth; *zhou* refers to past and future. The Great Beginning is the root of the Dao. One who meets the emptiness of questioning with a mind estranged from principle may be said to neither outwardly recognize the six directions and cosmos nor inwardly know the wondrous root of one’s own body.

Thus one does not pass beyond Kunlun, nor roam the Great Void.
[Annotation] As for those who wander the world, traverse the distant, and enter the profound obscurity—such a one does not answer, and that is all.
[Subcommentary] Kunlun is a mountain of great height; the Great Void is the profound principle. If one remains attached to names and words, still clinging to questions and answers, one has not yet traversed the heights or roamed the depths.

Guang Yao asked Wu You: Does the Master exist? Or does he not exist?
[Subcommentary] *Guang Yao* represents the power of discerning wisdom. *Wu You* is the realm of observation—wisdom can illuminate, hence the name *Guang Yao*; the realm is empty and quiescent, hence the name *Wu You*. Yet wisdom has brightness and dimness, while the realm has no depth or shallowness. Thus wisdom asks the realm: does it exist or not?

Guang Yao could not obtain an answer, yet when he examined its form and appearance, it was serene and empty. He gazed all day and saw nothing, listened and heard nothing, grasped and found nothing.
[Subcommentary] The wondrous realm is beyond sound and form, cutting off seeing and hearing—thus when one examines its appearance, it is only quiescence and emptiness.

Guang Yao said: It is perfect. Who can attain this?

I can attain "having" and "not-having," yet I cannot attain "not-not-having." How then could one reach this state?
[Annotation] This speaks to the meaning of cutting off all learning. When one severs attachment to the Dao, the learner returns to the root. Thus, the excellence of learning lies precisely in non-learning.
[Subcommentary] The luminous discernment of *Guang Yao* remains shallow—it can only grasp "not-having" by relinquishing "having," yet it cannot transcend both "having" and "not-having" together. Hence the sigh: how profound is "not-having"! Who could attain such mystery? Yet "not-having" does not merely negate "having"; it also negates "not-having," dissolving the four propositions and a hundred negations into utter absence. The word "not" in "not-having" leaves nothing un-negated—its expression is concise, yet its principle vast. Thus it is called "not." As for the question "how could one reach this?"—the realm of "not-having" exhausts principle and fulfills nature. Only those of profound virtue and superior attainment can embody it; shallow learners and petty wisdom have no means to arrive here.

The forger of hooks in the household of the Grand Marshal was eighty years old yet never missed by a hair’s breadth.
[Annotation] He grasped the weight of hammer and hook without the slightest deviation.
[Subcommentary] *Da Ma* was an official title, the Grand Marshal of Chu. *Chui* means to forge; *gou* refers to a belt hook. The Grand Marshal’s household had a craftsman who, from youth, excelled at forging hooks. Though he had reached eighty, his skill in hammering hooks grew ever more refined. His concentration was so single-minded that not even a hair’s breadth of error occurred. The hook here refers to a weighing hook, meaning he could judge the weight of hammer and hook with such precision that no deviation, however minute, escaped him.

The Grand Marshal asked: "Is your skill innate? Or have you attained the Way?"
[Subcommentary] The Marshal marveled that the old man’s forging grew more precise with age, suspecting his craft arose from some special method.

The craftsman replied: "I have my discipline. From the age of twenty, I devoted myself to forging hooks. I saw nothing else—nothing but hooks occupied my attention."
[Subcommentary] He had no other method, only steadfast devotion. From youth, he focused solely on this craft, observing nothing beyond hooks. Through long practice, it became his nature, and thus he reached such mastery.

That which is used arises from that which is not used, thereby prolonging its utility. How much more so for that which is never not used? What thing does not draw upon this principle?

[Annotation] With no attachments whatsoever, all things come in perfect response.
[Subcommentary] The reason he maintained his skill in forging hooks even into old age was that he relied on not directing his mind to observe other things. If even what is used borrows from what is not used to prolong its utility, how much more so for the sage who embodies the Dao—neither using nor not using, yet able to achieve great utility, from which all things draw sustenance? Is this not fitting?

Ran Qiu asked Confucius: "Could one know what existed before Heaven and Earth?"
Confucius replied: "Yes. The past is like the present."
[Annotation] Heaven and Earth have always existed; there was never a time when they did not.
[Subcommentary] Ran Qiu, a disciple of Confucius, raised the question to his teacher, inquiring whether the state before the existence of the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth) could be known. Since transformation renews daily, there is no present without the past, and the past is like the present—hence the answer that it could indeed be known.

Ran Qiu, having misunderstood the question, withdrew. The next day, he returned and said: "Yesterday, I asked whether one could know what existed before Heaven and Earth. You replied, 'Yes. The past is like the present.' Yesterday, I was enlightened; today, I am confused. May I ask what this means?"
[Subcommentary] He failed to grasp the intent of his question and left. Upon reconsidering the response, he returned to seek further clarification. Yesterday, his understanding was clear; today, it is obscured. He asks what accounts for this shift from clarity to confusion.

Confucius replied: "Yesterday’s clarity came because your spirit received it first.
[Annotation] With an empty mind awaiting instruction, the spirit receives.
Today’s confusion arises because you now seek with what is not spirit.
[Annotation] Striving to understand only leads to further obscurity.
[Subcommentary] Initially, he sought without comprehension, sharpening his spirit and applying his mind to receive, hence his clarity. Later, having grasped the answer, he no longer exerted his spirit but simply rested in natural truth, making no further inquiries—hence his confusion. "Seeking" here means not seeking at all.

There is no past, no present, no beginning, no end.
[Annotation] Not only does the nonexistent not transform into existence, but the existent also does not transform into nonexistence. Thus, as a thing, the nonexistent, though undergoing a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, cannot become nonexistent even once. Because it cannot become nonexistent even once, there has never been a time when Heaven and Earth did not exist, and they endure eternally.
[Subcommentary] Since change renews daily, there is no beginning and no end, no past and no present—hence one knows there was never a time before Heaven and Earth.

Could there be descendants without ancestors?
[Annotation] This speaks of an unbroken lineage without end.
[Subcommentary] It means that descendants do not arise from one another, and the lineage has no limit. Heaven, Earth, and all things—none have an origin or a time when they did not exist.
"Could this be?"—meaning it cannot. Ran Qiu did not respond.

Confucius said: "Enough, there is no response." Not by life does life give rise to death. [Annotation] Death is but spontaneous transformation—it is not that life gives rise to this death. Not by death does death give rise to life. [Annotation] Life, too, is but spontaneous transformation. [Subcommentary] 已 means "to cease"; 未 means "nonexistent." Gathering and scattering, death and life—all are spontaneous transformations, daily renewed, never relying on anything else, never dependent upon one another. Thus one does not use life to give rise to this death, nor death to give rise to this life. Ran Qiu’s unanswered question—Confucius bids him cease and make no response, for the principle is exhausted here. What more is there to say?

Do death and life depend upon one another? [Annotation] They are self-sufficient in spontaneous transformation. Each has its own integral form. [Annotation] Death and life each constitute a complete form. [Subcommentary] Death is spontaneous transformation—how could it become another thing? Since death does not depend upon life, we know that life does not depend upon death. Death and life, gathering and scattering—each has its own integral form, and thus nothing depends upon anything else.

Is there a thing that existed before Heaven and Earth? That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. A thing cannot emerge prior to things—it is still a thing. Since it is still a thing, there is no end. [Annotation] Who could exist prior to things? If we take yin-yang as prior to things, yet yin-yang is itself what we call a thing. Who, then, existed prior to yin-yang? If we take spontaneity as prior, yet spontaneity is but the self-so of things. If we take the supreme Dao as prior, yet the supreme Dao is the utmost nothingness. Since it is nothingness, what could precede it? Then who existed prior to things? Yet there are still things, without end—this makes clear that things are spontaneous, not made to be so by anything else. [Subcommentary] That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. Thus, not being a thing, it has no before or after. When a thing emerges, it is a thing, and there cannot be anything prior to this thing. How do we know this? Because it is still a thing. Extending this reasoning, there is ultimately nothing that existed prior to things. Then who existed prior to things? It is clear that things are spontaneous, and spontaneity has no end. Thus we know that Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things have existed from of old, without a time when they did not exist. The sage’s love for others never ends—this, too, is drawn from this principle. [Annotation] Drawing from the self-so, kindness flows through a hundred generations without ceasing. [Subcommentary] The sage who attains the Dao, in compassionate love and nurturing care, lets kindness flow through a hundred generations without end. This is because his virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, and he subtly embodies spontaneity. Thus he empties himself toward others, forgets all in his nurturing, does not impose benevolence upon the myriad things, and treats all beings as straw dogs. All this is drawn from this principle.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, saying: "I have once heard the Master say, 'Do not send off, do not welcome.' I venture to ask about its wandering." [Subcommentary] He requests the Master’s teaching. 将 means "to send off." The sage is like a mirror, neither sending off nor welcoming. Yan Hui, not yet understanding this principle, inquires of Confucius, asking about its source.

Confucius said: "The people of old externally transformed while internally remaining untransformed." [Annotation] They let the mind follow the form, and the form transformed of itself. [Subcommentary] The ancients were pure and simple, and many accorded with the Dao. Thus they could let their external forms follow things while their inner minds remained serene. "The people of today internally transform while externally remaining untransformed." [Annotation] They use the mind to manipulate the form. [Subcommentary] Internally, they are connected through conditions, ceaselessly transforming in ignorance; externally, their forms are perverse and cannot follow things. "Those who transform with things are one with the untransformed." [Annotation] Always without mind, thus one with the untransformed. Only one with the untransformed can transform with things. "At peace with transformation, at peace with non-transformation." [Annotation] Transformation and non-transformation are both entrusted to things—this is the absence of mind. [Subcommentary] 安 means "to entrust." The sage is without mind, flowing with things. Thus transformation and non-transformation are both entrusted to things, without distinction or deliberate intent. "At peace in following them, in harmony with them." [Annotation] Simply without mind, letting them transform of themselves—not sending off or welcoming to harmonize with them. [Subcommentary] 靡 means "to follow." The so-called entrusting of transformation and non-transformation means not opposing living beings but following and harmonizing with them. "Necessarily following them, yet not excessively so." [Annotation] Without sending off or welcoming, one is sufficient and stops. [Subcommentary] Though following things in harmony, one does not excessively bestow benevolence, each stopping at its proper place, without harm to self or other.

The park of Xiwei, the garden of the Yellow Emperor, the palace of Youyu, the chambers of Tang and Wu— [Annotation] These are the places where those without mind and entrusting transformation dwell. [Subcommentary] Xiwei, the Yellow Emperor, Youyu, Tang, and Wu were all sagely and enlightened kings. The way of being without mind and following things is the wandering park of Xiwei, the roaming garden of the Yellow Emperor, the virtue-nurturing palace of Youyu, the spirit-soothing chambers of Tang and Wu—these are where the many sages advance and dwell.

The gentleman, like the masters of the Ru and Mo schools, uses this to mutually destroy one another with right and wrong—how much more so the people of today! [Annotation] 聖 means "harmony." The masters of the Ru and Mo schools are the most difficult in the world to harmonize, yet one without mind can still harmonize with them—how much more so those who are near to it! [Subcommentary] 聖 means "harmony." The masters of the Ru and Mo schools ceaselessly refute one another with right and wrong—they are the most difficult in the world to harmonize. Yet the sage and gentleman can still follow and harmonize with them. How much more so the people of today, who are not masters of the Ru and Mo schools!

Following and transforming with them—is this not fitting?

The sage dwells among things without harming them.
**[Annotation]** Utmost compliance.
**[Subcommentary]** Abiding in the world with harmonious radiance, benefiting without harming—thus they do not injure.
One who does not harm things cannot be harmed by things.
**[Annotation]** This lies within me alone.
**[Subcommentary]** Like an empty boat or drifting tile, in perfect accord with the uncarved block, the uncarved block delights in being pushed—thus they dwell without harm.
Only one who harms nothing can truly meet and welcome others.
**[Annotation]** Without mind, one attains utmost compliance; with utmost compliance, one can transcend both meeting and welcoming, yet still surpass all acts of meeting and welcoming.
**[Subcommentary]** Only by peacefully accepting the uncarved nature of things, with no injury between self and other, can one engage with the world and illuminate the truth that there is no welcoming, yet all is welcomed.

Mountains and forests—
Meadows and wilds—
They make me joyful and glad.
**[Annotation]** Mountains, forests, meadows, and wilds are not superior to me, yet I delight in them—this is joy without cause.
Before the joy is complete, sorrow follows.
**[Annotation]** Joy without cause is also sorrow without cause.
Thus, what brings joy is hardly worth rejoicing over, and what brings sorrow is hardly worth grieving.
**[Subcommentary]** Clinging to fleeting emotions, forgetting life’s joys and sorrows, one suddenly gazes upon towering mountains and lush forests, upon sacred marshes and fertile lands, and is filled with admiration, deeming it bliss. Yet before the joy has faded, sorrow follows—emotions shift with circumstances, and joy and sorrow transform. This is joy without cause, sorrow without cause; thus, the world’s sorrows and joys are not worth reckoning.

When sorrow and joy come, I cannot resist them; when they depart, I cannot halt them.
Alas! The people of the world are but inns for things.
**[Annotation]** Unable to sit in forgetfulness and attain self-mastery, they become lodgings for sorrow and joy.
**[Subcommentary]** An inn is a guesthouse. The coming of poverty and success cannot be resisted; the departure of sorrow and joy cannot be stopped. Yet the common people, ignorant of this truth, are like inns where things lodge—mistaking the false for the real, how deeply lamentable!

One knows what one encounters but not what one does not encounter.
**[Annotation]** What one knows is what one encounters; what one does not know is what one does not encounter.
One can do what one is capable of but not what one is incapable of.
**[Annotation]** What one cannot do cannot be forced.
From this perspective, knowing and not knowing, being capable and incapable—control does not lie beyond me; it should be entrusted to nature.
**[Subcommentary]** Wisdom has its clarity and obscurity; ability has its skill and clumsiness—each is endowed by one’s inherent lot, and cannot be forced. Thus, what one’s lot brings, one knows; what it does not bring, one cannot know. What one’s nature allows, one can do; what it does not allow, one cannot. Like birds flying and fish swimming, spiders weaving webs and cicadas shedding shells—all follow their nature. Is this not their inherent way?
To be without knowledge or ability is something no person can avoid.
**[Annotation]** Each receives life according to their allotted portion.
**[Subcommentary]** Since one is not a sage, one’s wisdom cannot encompass all things. Thus, knowing and not knowing, being capable and incapable—each is bestowed differently at birth, with distinct mechanisms. Yet the common people stubbornly cling to what they cannot avoid.
To strive to avoid what no person can avoid—is this not also lamentable?
**[Subcommentary]** What no person can avoid are matters beyond one’s allotted wisdom and ability. Yet the petty and base cannot accept their lot, and so they strain their emotions, striving to stand alone—how foolish and deluded, how deeply pitiable!

The ultimate word transcends words; the ultimate act transcends acts.
**[Annotation]** All arise from self-mastery.
**[Subcommentary]** The ultimate principle’s words are beyond words—thus they are transcended. The ultimate principle’s acts are beyond acts—thus they are transcended.
To equal what knowledge knows is shallow indeed.
**[Annotation]** Those who rely on knowledge to attain understanding are merely learners—thus they are shallow.
**[Subcommentary]** Seeing the worthy and striving to equal them, imitating others to improve oneself, seeking principles through learning, pursuing the Dao through intellect—this is shallow and superficial. How can it be called profound knowledge?

*Commentary and Subcommentary on the Southern Florescence True Scripture, Scroll Twenty-Five*
*Annotations by Guo Xiang of Henan*

**Subcommentary by Master Cheng Xuanying of the Tang, Western Florescence School**
*Miscellaneous Chapters: "Gengsang Chu" (Twenty-Third)*

There was one named Gengsang Chu among the disciples of Lao Cong, who alone attained the Dao of Lao Cong.
**[Subcommentary]** His surname was Gengsang, his given name Chu—disciple of the Old Master, a recluse indeed. *Yi* (役) denotes a disciple; in ancient times, those who served their masters shared in their labors, undaunted by hardship or peril, hence the term *yi*. Yet the Old Master, being a great sage, had countless disciples. Among his followers, Gengsang Chu was the most eminent, thus it is said he "alone attained" the Way.

He dwelt in the north upon Mount Weilü. Those among his retainers who were artfully knowing departed from him; those among his concubines who were ostentatiously virtuous distanced themselves.
**[Annotation]** *Huaran* (画然) means "adorned with knowledge"; *xuran* (絮然) means "affected with virtue."
**[Subcommentary]** Mount Weilü is a mountain in the state of Lu. *Chen* (臣) refers to servants; *qie* (妾), to concubines. This speaks of how people treat benevolence and wisdom as servants and concubines, yet Master Gengsang cast aside both benevolence and wisdom in his dealings with the noble. Since Chu was a recluse dwelling in the mountain wilds, his nature was simple and unadorned, his heart disdaining superficial elegance. The men and women of the neighboring hills vied to serve as his retainers and concubines. Thus, those who *huaran* displayed their knowledge to flaunt their cleverness were expelled and sent away; those who *xuran* paraded their virtue to set themselves apart from others were made to keep their distance.

Those who were coarse and unrefined dwelt with him; those who were carefree and at ease served him.
**[Annotation]** *Yongzhong* (拥肿) means "uncouth"; *yangzhang* (鞅掌) means "self-content."
**[Subcommentary]** *Yongzhong* and *yangzhang* both describe the appearance of simplicity and self-contentment. Having cast off benevolence and wisdom, he returned to a state of tranquil authenticity. Thus, the unadorned and sincere dwelt with him, while those who followed their nature freely served him.

After three years, Weilü experienced a great harvest.

The people of Weilü said to one another: "When Master Gengsang first arrived, we were startled and found him strange."
**[Annotation]** They found him strange for abandoning knowledge and embracing simplicity.

"Now, when we reckon by the day, it seems insufficient; when we reckon by the year, there is surplus."
**[Annotation]** One who moves in harmony with the four seasons seeks no immediate gains.
**[Subcommentary]** *Darong* means "abundance." *Sa* describes a slight startle. After three years of his dwelling here, the mountains yielded great harvests, and the people of Weilü set aside their private ways, saying: "When Master Gengsang first came, we were slightly startled by him. At first, when we calculated by the day, the benefits seemed insufficient; but when we reckoned by the year, his achievements were more than enough. For the sage, in accord with the seasons, seeks no near-term gains—thus daily reckoning falls short—but embodies far-reaching virtue, so yearly reckoning yields surplus. Three years make a intercalary cycle, a minor completion of Heaven’s Way, hence after three years Weilü enjoyed great abundance. He must be a sage! Why do we not together honor him as our ancestral spirit, worship him as our earth deity, and venerate him as our grain god?"

The people said: "To *shu* is to admire; *ji* means 'near.' *Shi* means 'to preside.' This great worthy, Master Gengsang, so admires and draws near to the virtue of the sage—why do we not together honor him as our lord, presiding over the affairs of the southern face, establishing for him an earth shrine and grain altar, and raising a ancestral temple, with prayers and sacrifices according to ritual? Would this not be good?"

Master Gengsang heard this and turned to the south with an unsettled countenance. His disciples found this strange.

When he suddenly heard the people of Weilü propose to make him lord of the southern face, it ran counter to the Way of non-action, and so he was displeased. His disciples, not yet understanding this principle, were thus puzzled and found it strange.

Master Gengsang said: "Disciples, why do you find this strange in me? When the qi of spring stirs, the hundred grasses grow; when autumn’s proper moment arrives, the ten thousand treasures ripen. Do spring and autumn act with intent to bring this about? The Way of Heaven has already unfolded of itself."

For the vital qi of spring and autumn both accord with the natural Dao, and thus act without acting.

Spring’s growth and autumn’s fruition are the constant interplay of yin and yang; summer’s flourishing and winter’s storage are the unchanging pattern of things. Do spring and autumn then deliberately bestow their bounty upon the ten thousand treasures? The natural Way has already moved of itself, and so one forgets the virtue of their giving and having. Some texts write *treasures* as *ripening*, meaning the Two Modes take the ten thousand things as their treasure, and thus in autumn bring them to completion.

I have heard that the perfected person, dwelling in a humble chamber, lets the people roam wildly without knowing where to turn.

They simply go where they will, not by conscious direction.

The *environs* are walled on four sides, each a single *du*—this is called an “encircling *du*,” the so-called “square-zhang chamber.”  Like a corpse in stillness and emptiness, hence the term “dwelling as a corpse.”  Now, for the humble folk of Weilei to whisper and scheme, wishing to set me upon the ritual stands of the worthy—am I truly the one who marks the dipper’s handle?

[Annotation] He does not wish to be the world’s pointer.

[Exegesis] *Whisper and scheme* means to discuss in pairs.  The *zu* is the table for cutting meat; the *dou* is the vessel for holding dried meats—both are ritual implements.  The flock of dragons without a head is the maxim of the ancient sages; veiling virtue and nurturing tranquility is the track of later worthies.  Now these petty, fragmented commoners, murmuring in pairs and plotting together, wish to treat me as worthy, to honor me as master—this is to make me the world’s pointer.  How can this be called one who dwells in reclusion?  Therefore, I cannot let go of the words of the venerable Lao.

[Annotation] The *Biography of the Venerable Masters* says: “When merit is complete and affairs are settled, the hundred

A mere ditch of ordinary length cannot accommodate the turning of a great fish’s body, yet the minnow’s fins dictate its bounds; a hillock of a few paces’ height cannot conceal the bulk of a mighty beast, yet the ominous fox is deemed auspicious.

[Annotation] The disciple means that a great man must possess abundant emolument.

[Exegesis] Eight *chi* make a *xun*; twice a *xun* makes a *chang*. Six *chi* make a *bu*; seven *chi* make a *ren*. The *you* is a small fish with legs—this is no match for a leviathan. To *zhi* is to dominate. How can a ditch of such modest span accommodate the circling of a whale? Yet the puny *tongqi* fish is deemed splendid. A hillock of a few paces’ height cannot conceal a great beast, yet the malevolent fox is taken as a good omen. Thus we know that mighty beasts must dwell in deep mountains, and great men require ample emolument. Moreover, to honor the worthy and appoint the capable, to reward goodness and confer benefit—this has been the way since the time of Yao and Shun. How much more should the people of Weilei follow suit? Master, you too should heed this.

[Exegesis] To honor the noble and elevate the able, to employ the good first and grant them advantage—even the sage-kings Yao and Shun acted thus. How dare the common folk of Weilei deviate from the ancients’ example? You, Master, are a man of understanding; pray, listen and comply.

Gengsangzi said: Come here, young one. The beast that can swallow a carriage, once it leaves the mountain in its armor, cannot escape the snares and nets; the fish that can gulp a boat, once stranded and deprived of water, is tormented by ants. Thus birds and beasts do not tire of lofty heights, and fish and turtles do not tire of profound depths.

[Annotation] To distance oneself from profit and avoid harm is to preserve wholeness.

[Exegesis] That beast, vast enough to engulf a carriage, once solitary and parted from the mountain, cannot evade the peril of nets and traps. The fish that can swallow a boat, though its mass is no trifle, once cast adrift and bereft of water, is harmed by ants. Thus birds and beasts seek the high mountains, and fish and turtles the deep waters—do they do so out of love for the extraordinary? No, it is to preserve their bodies and avoid harm. If even birds and fish act thus, how much more should humans? For one who would preserve his embodied life, to conceal himself is to desire nothing so much as profound remoteness.

[Annotation] To entangle oneself in emolument is to be coarse and shallow.

[Exegesis] *Miao* means distant. The man who dwells in reclusion, who preserves his form and nurtures his life, must withdraw far from the dust of the world and plunge deep into mountain springs. To entangle oneself in emolument is to be coarse and shallow.

Moreover, what merit is there in praising those two? They are hardly worthy of exaltation.

[Annotation] The two are Yao and Shun.

[Exegesis] The two are Yao and Shun. The sagely ways of Tang and Yu are the root of disorder—how can they be worthy of praise? In their disputations, they would recklessly breach the walls to plant mugwort and brambles.

[Annotation] They would cause later generations to recklessly breach and sow disorder.

[Exegesis] They would cause later generations to recklessly breach and sow disorder. To *bian* is to distinguish. To establish the ways of Yao and Shun outside the nature of things, to teach and instruct people to emulate them, is like breaking through a fine wall to plant mugwort and brambles as a fence.

To comb one’s hair strand by strand, to count the grains of rice before cooking—

[Annotation] To fuss over the merest trifles.

[Exegesis] It is like selecting and combing each hair, measuring the grains of rice before cooking—such benefits are paltry, and the harm is greater still. How can such petty efforts suffice to save the world?

[Annotation] Only in undifferentiated unity, with nothing to manage or contrive, is there salvation.

[Exegesis] To imitate Yao and Shun, to whisper and scheme in private—this is but a minor path, how can it save the world? To exalt the worthy is for the people to contend;

[Annotation] To violate their nature in awaiting what they esteem.

To employ cunning is for the people to steal.

[Annotation] When authenticity is insufficient and cunning is employed to supplement it, falsehood arises. When falsehood is used to seek life, how can theft not follow?

[Exegesis] To contend. To exalt the worthy and appoint the capable, to employ cunning and reward goodness, is to incite strife and deceit, a hundred schemes of theft and fraud. The path of competition opens, and thus they harm one another.

These several things are insufficient to enrich the people. The people’s pursuit of profit is most ardent: sons kill fathers, ministers kill rulers, thieves rob in broad daylight, and burglars tunnel through walls at noon.

[Annotation] Without any further regard.

[Exegesis] These several things refer to exalting the worthy and employing cunning. Such teachings are superficial and cannot make the people sincere and generous. Yet the common folk’s hunger for profit stirs them deeply. Private grievances and resentments give rise to usurpation and regicide, endangering the altars of state. Thieves rob in broad daylight, attack cities, and tunnel through walls at noon.

I tell you, the root of great disorder must arise in the age of Yao and Shun, and its branches will endure for a thousand generations. A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another.

[Annotation] Yao and Shun bequeathed their legacy, spreading false adornments to later ages, leading to this corruption.

[Exegesis] The yielding and deference of Tang and Yu gave rise to usurpation and rebellion. The root of disorder began with Yao and Shun, and its ills will persist for a thousand generations. The Yellow Turbans and Red Eyebrows are instances of men devouring one another.

Nanrong Qu sat up straight with a start and said: At my age, I am already advanced in years—how can I entrust my studies to attain such words?

[Exegesis] His surname was Nanrong, his given name Qu, a disciple of Gengsang. *Cu ran* describes his startled demeanor. Having heard these teachings, Nanrong Qu was filled with admiration. Thus, with alarm and reverence, he composed himself and earnestly sought further instruction: I am old, my spirit dim and dull—what learning should I rely upon to reach such words?

Gengsangzi said: Preserve your form whole,

[Annotation] To keep to the mean.

Hold fast to your life,

[Annotation] Not to grasp beyond the bounds of life.

And let not your thoughts and cares flutter restlessly. If you do this for three years, you may attain such words.

[Exegesis] Not chasing after external objects is what it means to preserve the form whole; abiding within one’s proper bounds is what it means to hold fast to life. Once one rectifies one’s bounds and preserves life whole, the spirit congeals and the form finds ease—thus one no longer enslaves the knowing mind to restless thoughts, nor pursues life with ceaseless striving. After three years of emptiness and stillness, one may then attain such words. These are Gengsangzi’s instructions to Nanrong.

Nanrong responded: The eyes and the form—I do not perceive them as distinct, yet the blind cannot see themselves; the ears and the form—I do not perceive them as distinct, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves; the heart-mind and the form—I do not perceive them as distinct, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves.

[Annotation] Eyes and eyes, ears and ears, heart-minds and heart-minds—their forms appear alike, yet their capacities differ. If there is such difference, one cannot forcibly imitate or emulate another.

[Exegesis] Those who are blind or deaf possess eyes and ears no different from those of ordinary people, yet the blind cannot see colors, and the deaf cannot hear sounds. The mad resemble the sane in appearance, yet the mad have lost their nature and cannot grasp themselves. Nanrong offers these three analogies to illustrate the body as a whole: his failure to comprehend the words of the supreme Dao differs not from blindness or deafness. Thus, the *Inner Chapters* state: not only the physical frame may be blind or deaf—so too may wisdom. The form and the form are also closed off,

[Annotation] There has never been a barrier.

Yet do things perhaps inquire of one another, desiring to seek each other yet unable to attain one another?

[Annotation] Though the two forms stand open, they cannot attain one another—there must be some separation between them.

[Exegesis] *Bi* means "open," *wen* means "separation." The blind and the sighted—both possess open apertures in their forms; seeing and not seeing—yet in things there arises a separation. The blind and deaf seek what lies between sight and hearing, but in the end cannot attain it, just as Nanrong seeks understanding and awakening yet has no means to reach it. Now I say to you: preserve your form whole, embrace your life, and let not your thoughts and cares flutter restlessly. Strive to hear the Dao and let it reach your ears.

[Annotation] Having heard too late, the forms are already divided—thus transformation is difficult.

[Exegesis] "Preserve your form whole, embrace your life"—as explained before. Reiterating what was asked to clarify the intent of the question.

Master Gengsang said: "My words are exhausted." He continued: The darting wasp cannot transform the bean caterpillar; the Yue chicken cannot brood the swan’s egg—only the Lu chicken can do so.

[Exegesis] The *benfeng* is the narrow-waisted wasp. *Huò* is the bean; *zhú* is the large green worm found in beans. The Yue chicken is the Jing chicken; the Lu chicken is the present-day Shu chicken. The narrow-waisted wasp can transform the mulberry worm into its own offspring, yet cannot transform the bean caterpillar. The Yue chicken, being small, cannot brood the swan’s egg; the Shu chicken, being large, certainly can. This means my talent is meager and cannot transform the great—what I have said exhausts the principle of the matter. Chickens and chickens—though their virtue is not different, some can and some cannot, for their talents are inherently great or small. Now my talent is small and insufficient to transform you. Why do you not go south to see Laozi?

[Exegesis] The chicken possesses five virtues: wearing a crest upon its head is propriety; having spurs upon its feet is righteousness; calling others when it finds food is benevolence; knowing the seasons is wisdom; facing an enemy and standing its ground is courage. Though the Lu and Yue chickens differ, their heavenly virtue is the same—thus some can and some cannot because their talents differ in size. I am like the Yue chicken, my talent too small to transform you. Why do you not journey south to seek a teacher and pay homage to the Old Master?

Nanrong Chu wrapped his provisions and, after seven days and seven nights, arrived at the place of Laozi.

[Exegesis] *Yíng* means "to wrap," "to carry." His reverence for the sage was fervent, ceaseless day and night, and after seven days he finally beheld the Old Master.

Laozi said: "Have you come from Chu?"

Nanrong Chu replied: "Yes."

[Exegesis] *Zì* means "from." The question: "Have you come from the place of Sang Chu?" Nanrong Zhao replied: "Yes"—a simple, respectful affirmation.

Laozi said: "Why have you come with so many people?"

[Annotation] He came bearing the weight of three words.

[Exegesis] *Xié* means "together." Laozi, being a sage, perceived his motive as clearly as a mirror. Yet he had not forgotten benevolence and righteousness, so he reproached him for coming with others. Clinging to the three words, he thus mocked him for coming with a crowd.

Nanrong Chu, startled, looked back behind him.

The exegesis states: *Jurán* describes a startled appearance. Not yet comprehending Laozi’s words, he suddenly heard mention of “coming with a crowd,” and so he glanced behind him, fearing there were many people.

Laozi said: “Do you not understand what I meant?”

The exegesis states: *Wèi* refers to the meaning of words. When I spoke of “coming together,” I was mocking you for bearing the weight of three words. That you looked behind you shows you did not grasp my meaning.

Nanrong Chu bowed his head in shame, then raised it and sighed, saying: “Just now I forgot my reply, and so lost my question.”

The exegesis states: *Fǔ* means to lower the head. Realizing his own dullness and failure to grasp the sage’s words, he bowed in humiliation, then raised his head and sighed to the heavens. His spirit wandered in confusion, his countenance flustered. Not only had he lost his composure, but he had also forfeited his chance to ask.

Laozi said: “What do you mean?”

The exegesis states: He asked what his words signified.

Nanrong Chu said: “Do you not know? People call me a fool. Do you know? It only brings sorrow upon my body.”

The exegesis states: *Zhū yú* means “utterly foolish,” an appearance of ignorance. If one remains mired in the dust of the world, one earns the name of a fool; but if one employs wisdom to engage with others, it only invites disaster to oneself. Since the harm lies within, he speaks of “sorrow upon my body.” Without benevolence, one harms others; with benevolence, one brings sorrow upon oneself. Without righteousness, one injures others; with righteousness, one brings sorrow upon oneself. How can I escape this? These three words are the afflictions that trouble me. I wish to ask through Chu.

The exegesis states: Benevolence is the path of universal love; righteousness is the work of perfecting others. Both are the teachings of the former sages, yet they are not the way to preserve oneself and avoid harm. Thus, without benevolence or righteousness, one harms others; but practicing benevolence and righteousness, one strays from the true and turns from the Dao. Not knowing how to govern the heart to escape this and cease harm, he entrusts these three words to Sang Chu as an intermediary, hoping to remain and listen to further instruction.

Laozi said: “Earlier, I saw the question in your brows and eyes, and so I understood you. Now your words confirm it. You are like one who, having lost his parents, frantically raises a pole to search for them in the sea. You are a lost man—bewildered, adrift.”

The exegesis states: *Guīguī* means petty and fragmented. Your heart is narrow and scattered, clinging to these three burdens like a child who has lost his parents, or like a monk raising a wooden staff to seek the ocean, hoping to fathom its depths—how could that be possible? You are one who has lost the true and forsaken the Dao, a drowning man, a fugitive. Where can you find refuge? You long to reach your nature and disposition, yet have no way in—how pitiful.

The exegesis states: Nanrong Zhao treads the path of the sages yet drowns in benevolence and righteousness. Though he desires to return to the origin and restore his true nature, the wounds have already formed, and there is no way in. The great sage, moved by compassion, finds this deeply lamentable.

Nanrong Chu asked to return to his lodging. There, he summoned what he loved and cast aside what he despised. After ten days of sorrowful reflection, he again sought out Laozi.

The exegesis states: Having lost his question, his mind wandered in confusion. He withdrew to his dwelling, spent ten days in contemplation, pursuing the Dao and virtue he cherished, and discarding the benevolence and righteousness he loathed. Yet he still could not grasp the Dao, so he grieved and, hoping for further instruction, returned to see Laozi.

Laozi said: “You have cleansed yourself—how thoroughly, how deeply! Yet within, there still lingers something foul, seeping out.”

The exegesis states: After returning home for ten days, he had washed away the five impurities and purified his accumulated grime. Yet when I observe your qi, though it is dense and profound, and though you have applied effort, it still leaks—this proves that the foulness is not yet fully expelled. That which is grasped externally cannot be seized in abundance, lest it strike within; that which is grasped internally cannot be seized in error, lest it strike without.

Here follows the translation:

---

The annotation states: *Jian* is the bolt of a lock. The ears and eyes belong to the external; the heart’s extension belongs to the internal. To preserve the body and embrace life, nothing compares to forgetting the heart’s extension and relinquishing the ears and eyes. If sounds and sights assail from without, then the heart’s extension becomes obstructed within; if desires and aversions are seized within, then the ears and eyes are lost without. Only when the lock is neither gained nor lost can one attain passage.

The exegesis states: *Huo* denotes being bound. *Jian* refers to closing. *Fan* means urgency. *Miu* means earnestness. When one employs the ears and eyes externally and is seized by sounds and sights, the spirit becomes closed and obstructed within. If one employs the heart’s intelligence internally and is led by desires and aversions, then the ears and eyes become closed and obstructed without. This is the mutual resonance of internal and external, the sign of the lock. Even if one uses the mind to restrain, grasps urgently with the hands, or earnestly clings, there is no way to attain it. Only when the spirit is settled within and the ears and eyes are still without does one accord with the Way of preserving life. Those who are seized externally and internally cannot be upheld by the Dao and virtue—how much less those who abandon the Dao and act recklessly?

The annotation states: Partial seizure is already impossible—how much more when both external and internal are seized? When the ears and eyes are dazzled without and the heart’s guard drifts within, even if one grasps urgently with the hands or clings earnestly, one cannot stop it.

The exegesis states: Partial attachment to one side already deviates from the principle of life—how much more when both internal and external are submerged in delusion, deepening the confusion? Even those who embrace the Dao and hold to virtue cannot uphold themselves—how much less those who scatter the profound Dao and indulge in such delusions, hoping to restrain them?

Nanrong Chu said: If a villager is ill, and another villager asks about it, the sick one can describe his illness—yet if he can still speak of his illness, he is not yet truly ill.

The exegesis states: When someone in the village is ill, and neighbors inquire, if the sick person can describe his symptoms, though ill, he is not yet gravely afflicted and may still be cured. This is like Nanrong, who, though foolish, can confess his faults and thus may be taught. But when Chu hears the great Dao, it is like taking medicine that worsens the illness.

The exegesis states: Medicine is for curing illness; when the illness is gone, the medicine is dissolved. Teaching is for awakening insight; when insight is awakened, teaching ceases. If one is not truly ill, the medicine does not dissolve; if the teaching remains and insight does not awaken, is this not like taking medicine that worsens the illness? Chu only wishes to hear the classic of preserving life.

The exegesis states: *Jing* means constancy. *Yi* means cessation. The teachings of the sages are manifold, and the gates of learning are not one. What I now seek is to preserve life; my heart’s intent rests solely upon this. If you would instruct me, I shall take it as my constant guide.

Laozi said: In the classic of preserving life, can you embrace the One?

The annotation states: Not departing from one’s nature.

The exegesis states: Guarding the true without duality.

Can you not lose it?

The annotation states: Returning to one’s own attainment.

The exegesis states: Attaining one’s own nature.

Can you know good and ill fortune without divination?

The annotation states: What accords is good; what transgresses is ill—no need for divination.

The exegesis states: Treading the Dao is good; pursuing things is ill. This principle is certain—why resort to divination?

Can you stop?

The annotation states: Stopping at one’s allotted portion.

The exegesis states: Not pursuing what lies beyond one’s portion.

Can you cease?

The annotation states: Not chasing past paths.

The exegesis states: Not pursuing what has passed.

Can you abandon others and seek within yourself?

The annotation states: Preserving the self without imitating others.

The exegesis states: *Zhu* means "in." Abandoning the mind that imitates others and pursuing the Dao within oneself.

Can you be supple?

The annotation states: Without lingering traces.

The exegesis states: Coming and going without attachment.

Can you be yielding?

The annotation states: Without obstruction.

The exegesis states: Accord with things without resistance.

Can you be like a child?

The exegesis states: Like a newborn babe.

A child may wail all day without hoarseness or strain, for harmony is perfect.

The annotation states: Letting the voice emerge naturally, not due to joy or anger.

The exegesis states: *Ya* means throat obstruction. *Geng* means voice breaking. Letting the qi issue forth in sound, the heart free of joy or anger, the child may cry all day without breaking or obstruction. Such pure harmony, such steadfastness, attains this state.

All day it grasps without the hand growing weary, for it shares in the power.

The annotation states: Letting the hand grasp naturally, not holding alone.

The exegesis states: *Zhao* means cramping. *Lao* means weariness. Because its harmony is one with the profound Dao and its utmost power.

All day it gazes without the eyes shifting, for its focus is not on externals.

The annotation states: Letting the eyes see naturally, not bound to sights.

The exegesis states: *Xuan* means movement. Letting the eyes see without the gaze shifting, not fixating on external dust.

It walks without knowing its destination.

The annotation states: Letting the feet walk naturally, without aim.

The exegesis states: *Zhi* means "to go." Like a boat untethered, though it moves, it has no fixed destination.

It dwells without knowing what it does.

The annotation states: Letting the body follow its own course.

The exegesis states: Serene and inactive, the utmost stillness.

It flows with things,

The annotation states: This is accordance.

The exegesis states: Engaging with things without resistance, bending and yielding.

and moves with their waves.

The annotation states: The waves of things are also its waves.

The exegesis states: Blending light and merging traces, moving with their waves.

This is the classic of preserving life.

The exegesis states: Summarizing the foregoing, completing the meaning.

Nanrong Chu said: Then is this the virtue of the perfected person?

The annotation states: If one can reform oneself and employ these words, one may yet be called the virtue of the perfected person.

The exegesis states: Following the aforementioned classic of preserving life and practicing it accords with the profound Dao.

Is this all there is to the virtue of the perfected person? No, it is not. This is what is called the thawing of ice and the melting of frost—

The annotation states: If one can achieve this, it is clear this does not arise of itself.

The exegesis states: Nanrong has long been constrained by benevolence and righteousness; only now, upon hearing the sagely teaching, does he begin to understand the preservation of life. It is like winter ice meeting the spring sun—his clinging, stagnant heart dissolves and scatters at this moment. This awakening comes through learning, not by natural spontaneity. If one can achieve this, it is clear it is not yet true.

This is Laozi’s answer to Yue’s question.

The perfected person shares in eating from the earth and delights together in heaven—

The annotation states: Without a heart of his own, he is one with all things.

The exegesis states: The perfected person, free of partiality, responds to things as they arise. Thus, he shares in the sustenance of all beings from the earth and delights in heaven together with the common folk. *Jiao* means "to share."

He does not use the gains and losses of others to disturb himself, nor does he conspire with them in strangeness, nor plot with them, nor act with them—

The exegesis states: *Lou* means "to disturb." The perfected person, with an empty heart, follows the world and moves with the waves of things. Thus, he puts an end to strange phenomena in the realm of ordinary life and severs scheming discourse among the masses. Since he does not treat affairs as affairs, how could gains and losses disturb him?

He comes and goes, drifting like a fish, moving like a startled deer.

This is called the classic of guarding life.

The exegesis states: Reiterating the preceding text to conclude its meaning.

It is asked: Can one truly reach this state?

The commentary notes: Does this mean one can attain this through mere words?

The exegesis states: Hearing these words, one may approach the ultimate.

Nanrong, dull of wit, pressed Laozi further.
Laozi replied: Not yet.
I have already told you: Can you be like an infant?

The commentary notes: This is not to say the words themselves are insufficient, but that those who merely hear and study them do not attain it on their own. If one does not reach it independently, then even hearing the ultimate words can only serve as a classic—how could one truly arrive? Thus, the learner does not attain, and the attainer does not learn.

The exegesis states: The phrase "can you" is an encouraging exhortation. Though these words are ultimate, they remain like the fish-trap and rabbit-snare. Since I have told you, you must receive them through study. Yet the learner does not attain, and the attainer does not learn—fish and trap differ in kind, hence the answer: "Not yet." This is Laozi’s further reply to Nanrong.

An infant moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes. Its body is like the branch of a withered tree, and its heart is like dead ashes.

The exegesis states: Empty, tranquil, and serene, without emotion—like a withered tree that bears no blossoms, or dead ashes that cast no light. When both body and heart are doubly relinquished, how can its movements be known? This is the essence of guarding life.

Should one be thus, neither misfortune arrives nor fortune comes. With neither misfortune nor fortune, how can there be human calamity?

**Commentary:** Misfortune and fortune arise from loss and gain; human calamity stems from love and aversion. Now, like withered wood or dead ashes, utterly devoid of emotion, love and aversion, loss and gain have no means to arise.

**Exegesis:** Misfortune and fortune are born of gain and loss; human calamity arises from beauty and ugliness. Now, with form like withered wood and heart like dead ashes, gain and loss both forgotten, beauty and ugliness both relinquished—even the obscure cannot be blamed, so how can calamity enter? When the dwelling of power is tranquil and settled, it emits the radiance of Heaven.

**Commentary:** When the dwelling of virtue is serene and settled, what it emits is the radiance of Heaven, not human brilliance.

**Exegesis:** The body is the abode of spirit, hence the perfected person is called the dwelling of Dao and virtue. When the dwelling of virtue is peaceful, tranquil, and settled, the light it emits to illuminate things arises from the natural radiance of wisdom. That which emits the radiance of Heaven is seen by others as human,

**Commentary:** The radiance of Heaven emits of itself; thus, others see it as human, and things see it as things. Each sees itself and not the other, which is why it remains serene and settled.

**Exegesis:** The common and mediocre cannot fathom the sage; they see only one among the multitude, unaware of the distant illumination of Heaven’s radiance. Should there be one who cultivates, only then is there constancy.

**Commentary:** One who cultivates humanity attains self-mastery, hence remains perpetually serene.

**Exegesis:** *Heng* means constancy. Though principle severs learning, the Way still relies on seeking. Thus, those who truly cultivate can unite with the constancy of the congealed Dao. Those who are constant are sheltered by others and aided by Heaven.

**Commentary:** Being perpetually serene, one returns to dwell in one’s own abode and naturally receives assistance.

**Exegesis:** Those who embody constancy move in accord with auspicious convergence; they are sheltered by the people and blessed by the August Heaven—is this not fitting? Those sheltered by others are called Heaven’s people; those aided by Heaven are called Heaven’s son.

**Commentary:** When active, one is Heaven’s son; when at rest, one is Heaven’s people—both are capable. This is achieved through serenity and self-mastery, not through striving.

**Exegesis:** When active, one is sovereign; when at rest, one is a recluse—both attain this through embodying the Dao and constancy. The learner learns what cannot be learned; the doer does what cannot be done; the debater debates what cannot be debated.

**Commentary:** What can be done, though done, is not doing; what can be practiced, though practiced, is not learning; what can be said, though said, is not debating.

**Exegesis:** What lies within one’s portion, though done, is not doing—thus, though one learns, it is not learning; though one acts, it is not acting; though one debates, it is not debating. How could one then act beyond one’s portion or learn what cannot be learned? To know to stop at what cannot be known is perfection.

**Commentary:** What cannot be known cannot be forcibly known, hence stopping here is perfection.

**Exegesis:** Following what one can do and stopping at one’s portion—what cannot be known is not forcibly known. This is the ultimate subtlety of learning. Should there be one who does not abide by this, the balance of Heaven will ruin them.

**Commentary:** Though one may intend to act, acting will bring ruin; in the end, it cannot be done.

**Exegesis:** Should one harbor intentions beyond one’s portion, not taking what lies within as right, this is to ruin the natural nature. Prepare things to nurture form,

**Commentary:** Follow what is naturally prepared and accord with the completion of form.

**Exegesis:** *Jiang* means to accord. The great furnace of creation provides all things in full; one need only accord with the completion of form in seeking principle. Conceal without anticipation to give rise to the heart,

**Commentary:** The heart arises of itself, not through anticipation. *Yu* means conjecture and estimation.

**Exegesis:** The perfected person is without emotion; things move, and response follows. Embracing the wisdom of the sage, the heart arises in encounter with things, yet never premeditates or conjectures. Revere the inner to reach the outer,

**Commentary:** Principle reaches the outer of itself, not through revering the inner while neglecting the outer.

**Exegesis:** The inner is inner wisdom; the outer is external circumstances. Revering and honoring spiritual wisdom, one dares not lightly defile it. With wisdom congealed and tranquil, circumstances naturally become empty and open. Should the myriad evils arrive in this state, they are all of Heaven,

**Commentary:** The principles of Heaven inherently have exhaustion and passage.

and not of human,

**Commentary:** Acting to bring about evil is of human origin.

**Exegesis:** Though King Wen was imprisoned at Youli and Confucius was besieged at Kuang, their wisdom was not dim, nor were they not sages—yet they encountered such myriad evils and exhaustion. This was due to the timing and fate of Heaven, not human action. It is not enough to disturb completion.

**Commentary:** Accepting bitter fate, their completion remains undisturbed.

**Exegesis:** *Gu* means disorder. Embodying the Dao and uniting with truth, one accords with time and comprehends fate. Even when encountering myriad evils, it is not enough to disorder the heart of great completion. It cannot enter the numinous terrace.

**Commentary:** The numinous terrace is the heart; when clear and unobstructed, sorrow and restlessness cannot enter.

**Exegesis:** *Nei* means to enter. The numinous terrace is the heart. With the wondrous body empty and tranquil, worldly things cannot enter the numinous terrace. The numinous terrace has that which holds,

**Commentary:** That which holds means not being moved by things; in reality, it is not holding.

**Exegesis:** Only the heart that can hold is valued, yet one does not know how it holds. Yet it is not known what it holds,

**Commentary:** If one knew what it held, it would be holding.

and what cannot be held.

**Commentary:** To hold is to lose.

**Exegesis:** If one harbors the intention to hold, one strays far from it—hence, it cannot be done. Not seeing one’s sincerity and yet acting,

**Commentary:** This is reckless action.

each action is inappropriate.

Those whose actions do not arise from genuine sincerity—how could they ever be appropriate?

**Commentary:** Actions not rooted in one’s true sincerity cannot be fitting.

**Exegesis:** The preceding passage revealed the luminous wisdom of those who attain the Dao; what follows clarifies how those who lose their true nature err with deluded minds, straying into silence. *Sincerity* means reality. Without ever turning inward to reflect with true wisdom, one rashly acts from a deluded heart. Since the heart is not genuine, every action deviates from what is truly fitting. Karma enters and does not depart.

**Commentary:** Matters exceed one’s proper bounds.

**Exegesis:** *Karma* means affairs. Worldly affairs, tangled and chaotic, constantly enter the heart. Failing to discern what to reject or accept, one cannot let them go. Each time, one errs further.

**Commentary:** Only actions arising from genuine sincerity are deemed right.

**Exegesis:** Each time the heart acts deludedly, it chases after external objects, mistaking this for attainment—yet it only further loses its true nature. Those who do evil openly are punished by others; those who do evil in secret are punished by spirits.

**Exegesis:** Though humans and spirits differ in their visible and hidden paths, when it comes to acting with sincerity and treading truth, the Dao admits no separation. If one strays from one’s proper bounds and loses truth, retribution follows—resentment and response intertwine, leading to punishment. The cases of Zai Bo and Peng Sheng exemplify this. Only those who are clear about humans and clear about spirits can walk alone.

**Commentary:** With nothing to feel ashamed of in the seen or unseen, one walks alone without fear.

**Exegesis:** When the two paths of the seen and unseen are free of reproach, and one does not offend others, one can walk alone without fear. Those within their allotted bounds act without seeking fame.

**Commentary:** *Allotted bounds* means one’s proper share. Those who move within their bounds do not act for the sake of fame.

**Exegesis:** *Allotted bounds* means one’s share. *Without fame* is the Dao. Those who tread the Dao and act within their bounds do so without seeking advancement through fame. Those beyond their allotted bounds fix their minds on extravagant waste.

**Commentary:** Whether beneficial or not, they strive to diminish themselves for the sake of others.

**Exegesis:** *Extravagant waste* means ultimate ruin. Those who posture and act beyond their bounds, their minds wandering outside their proper share, achieve no true benefit and ultimately suffer loss. Those who act without seeking fame possess an inherent radiance.

**Commentary:** This radiance is innate and thus employed.

**Exegesis:** *Possess* means to employ. Those whose minds abide in the nameless Dao find their wisdom’s use growing ever more luminous. Those who fix their minds on extravagant waste are but merchants.

**Commentary:** Though they lack what they seek, they still borrow from others to trade.

**Exegesis:** Those who fix their minds on what lies beyond their bounds, striving for fame and profit while depleting their spirit and wisdom, are driven solely by reputation and gain—like merchants who buy high to sell. Others see their peril, yet they remain complacent.

**Commentary:** Those who pursue extravagance see their own downfall, yet still consider themselves secure.

**Exegesis:** *Peril* means danger. *Complacent* means at ease. Those who greedily grasp and seek beyond their bounds appear dangerous to others, yet they themselves feel secure—utter folly. Those who exhaust themselves with things are entered by things.

**Commentary:** *Exhaust* means to follow through to the end.

**Exegesis:** This refers to cessation. Those who harmonize with things, exhausting principle and fulfilling their nature, become a refuge for external things. Those who merely dabble with things cannot even contain themselves—how could they contain others?

**Commentary:** *Dabble* refers to those who act beyond their bounds and stumble. The stumbling cannot stand—how could they contain themselves? Unable to contain themselves, how could they contain others? If others are not contained, they depart.

**Exegesis:** Those who casually engage with others, clinging to superficiality, seeking profit and fame, their bodies already strained and their hearts restless—unable to contain themselves, how could they contain others? Those who cannot contain others have no intimacy; those with no intimacy are abandoned by all.

**Commentary:** If one cannot even contain oneself, then even the self is not one’s own—how could there be intimacy? Thus, all become others.

**Exegesis:** Narrow-mindedness precludes intimacy; without intimacy, all become others. With many adversaries and few allies, how can one hope for peace and security? No weapon is more reckless than the will—even the finest swords are inferior.

**Commentary:** What the will seizes burns like fire and congeals like ice—thus, it is more destructive than blades.

**Exegesis:** Weapons and blades are instruments of violence; *Mó Zōu* is an excellent sword. Yet nothing is more poisonously harmful than the heart. What the heart’s will pursues acts swiftly without haste—its harm surpasses even the finest swords. By comparison, armed conflict is inferior. No enemy is greater than yin and yang—there is no escape from them within heaven and earth.

**Exegesis:** *Enemy* means adversary. The heart’s gains and losses, joys and sorrows, wage war within the breast—its cold congeals like ice, its heat burns like fire. This is the enemy of yin and yang. Though one might flee a mighty foe, how can one escape when the battle arises within the heart? It is not that yin and yang harm one, but that the heart commands them.

**Commentary:** When the heart commands qi, yin and yang congeal in the five viscera, and their presence pervades everywhere—thus, there is no escape.

**Exegesis:** This is not that yin and yang harm people, but that the heart’s restlessness causes it. The Dao flows through both one’s allotted share and its completion—its fulfillment is also its ruin.

**Commentary:** Completion and ruin have no fixed share, yet the Dao flows through both.

**Exegesis:** All things receive qi according to their limits—beauty and ugliness, good and evil, are discerned by their allotted shares. What one calls completion, another calls ruin. The Dao flows through all, leaving nothing incomplete. What is detestable about one’s allotted share is that it is complete in itself.

**Commentary:** Not abiding by one’s share yet seeking completion is why one detests it.

**Exegesis:** Honor and disgrace, long life and early death, are bestowed by nature. Within one’s original share, one is already complete.

Those who stray beyond their allotted share to seek completion wander the realm of right and wrong, detesting the share they have received. What is detestable about completion is that it is already complete.

**Commentary:** One’s original share is not complete, yet one seeks completion—this is why completion is detestable. If one’s original share were inherently complete, how could it be detested?

**Exegesis:** To resent what nature has already bestowed is to fail to recognize that one was complete from the beginning. Thus, to depart and not return is to become a ghost.

**Commentary:** Failing to return and abide within one’s allotted share ensures that death is not far off.

**Exegesis:** To depart in delusion, blindly pursuing the realm of right and wrong without returning to one’s origin, is to hasten toward death—hence, one appears as a ghost. To depart and gain is called gaining death.

**Commentary:** Not departing brings no gain, yet this is how life is preserved.

**Exegesis:** To let the heart depart in pursuit of things, indulging desire and obtaining what it seeks, is to grasp the root of death and extinction. Extinction with substance is one with the ghostly.

**Commentary:** Having extinguished one’s nature, though one still lives, how is this different from a ghost?

**Exegesis:** To lose one’s original nature and cling to the body as real is to blur the distinction between death and the ghostly—thus, one becomes one with ghosts. It is by the formed that the formless is modeled and made definite.

**Commentary:** Though one has form, if one can remain vast and free of attachment, life is preserved and form stabilized.

**Exegesis:** *Xiang* means "to resemble." Though one has form, to resemble the formless is to recognize that form is not truly existent. To be vast and forget the self is to harmonize the spirit and stabilize the light. Does emergence have no source?

**Commentary:** It arises of itself, without a source.

To enter has no home.

**Commentary:** It perishes of itself, without a root.

**Exegesis:** Emergence is birth; entry is death. From nothing emerges something, yet something has no root or origin. From something returns nothing, yet nothing has no aperture. There is substance yet nowhere to reside; there is length yet no root or branch.

**Exegesis:** *Piao* means "branch" or "origin." Here, it follows the character’s reading. From nothing emerges something—this body is real, yet when one seeks its cause, there is nowhere it resides. From ancient times to the present, it is vast and long, yet when one traces past and present, there is no root or branch. There is emergence yet no aperture—what is real has substance.

**Commentary:** What emerges has substance, yet its emergence has no root or aperture.

**Exegesis:** What emerges without an aperture, when viewed superficially, seems to have substance, yet in truth, it does not. There is substance yet nowhere to reside—this is space.

**Commentary:** Space has four directions, above and below, yet these directions have no limit.

**Exegesis:** Space is the four directions, above and below. When things arise, they seem to have substance, yet when one seeks their place within space, there is nowhere they come from. If space is not so, how can there be a place? There is length yet no root or branch—this is time.

**Commentary:** Time has the length of past and present, yet this length has no end.

**Exegesis:** Time is past and present. The span of seasons is called past and present; when one traces the succession of ages, there is no root or branch. If time is not so, how can there be a root? There is life, there is death, there is emergence, there is entry—yet in emergence and entry, no form is seen.

**Commentary:** Life and death, emergence and entry, all arise of themselves, without cause—thus, no form is seen.

**Exegesis:** Emergence and entry arise from life and death. Though emergence and entry have names, when one exhaustively investigates their nature, there is no form of emergence or entry to be seen. This is called the Gate of Heaven.

**Commentary:** The Gate of Heaven is the collective name for the ten thousand things. To call it the Gate of Heaven is like calling it the Gate of Myriad Mysteries.

**Exegesis:** Heaven refers to the natural; the natural means having no cause. All things arise without source, their origins unfathomable—this is the gate of creation. The Gate of Heaven is nothingness, and the ten thousand things emerge from nothingness.

**Commentary:** Life and death, emergence and entry, all arise of themselves, without a doer. Though there is gathering and scattering, concealment and revelation—hence the names of emergence and entry—these are merely names; in truth, there is no emergence or entry. Where, then, is the gate? Thus, nothingness is the gate. If nothingness is the gate, then there is no gate.

**Exegesis:** The principle of nature, the gate of creation, has only a name and no reality. Yet all things emerge from this gate—hence, Guo’s commentary says "nothingness is the gate." If nothingness is the gate, then there is no gate. The existent cannot make existence exist.

**Commentary:** Before existence exists, what makes it exist? It must arise from itself—how can existence make existence exist?

**Exegesis:** Once existence exists, how can it make existence exist? Before existence exists, what gives rise to it? When one seeks the origin of existence, there is no existence. It must emerge from nothingness.

**Commentary:** This clarifies that existence cannot make existence exist but arises from itself—not that nothingness can make existence exist. If nothingness could make existence exist, what would nothingness be?

**Exegesis:** Whether existence has arisen or not, both are nothingness. That existence emerges from nothingness does not mean nothingness gives rise to existence. If nothingness could give rise to existence, what would nothingness be? Yet nothingness does not have a single nothingness.

**Commentary:** If there were a single nothingness, it would be absolute nothingness. If nothingness were absolute, then existence would arise of itself—this is clear.

**Exegesis:** Beyond all negations and affirmations, all is nothingness—hence, "a single nothingness."

The sage conceals himself herein.
**Commentary:** He allows things to arise of themselves, yet does not generate generation.
**Exegesis:** The sage of profound virtue, in dark union with the truth, conceals spirit and hides wisdom—herein he abides.

The ancients, their knowledge reached a point of utmost attainment.
**Exegesis:** The sages of primordial antiquity, those who attained the Dao, merged knowledge with reality—thus it was called "utmost."

How did it reach this point?
**Exegesis:** By what means did it attain this? What was done to reach it?

There were those who took "never yet having had things" as the utmost, the ultimate—nothing could be added to it.
**Exegesis:** This reveals the form and state of utmost attainment. Knowledge having reached its apex, all within observation is empty—thus they could employ all dharmas of existence while never having had a single thing. This may be called the most refined and subtle, the exhaustion of principle and the fulfillment of nature, the height of emptiness and wonder—nothing more could be added.

Next were those who took "having things" as their view,
**Exegesis:** Those below this, not having grasped true emptiness, regarded the ten thousand phenomena as "having things."

and who saw life as loss,
**Commentary:** Loss of its dispersion to gather into unity.
with death as return.
**Commentary:** Returning to fusion and fluidity.
**Exegesis:** Loss means deprivation. The common crowd takes life as gain and death as loss. Now, to reverse deluded sentiments, they take life as loss—for it is nothingness—and death as return, a return to emptiness and quiescence. Though not yet having exhausted the utmost wonder, they still equalize life and death.

Thus they made distinctions.
**Commentary:** Though they sought to equalize, distinctions remained.
**Exegesis:** Though they equalized life and death, they still perceived differences between life and death—thus distinctions arose from what is not.

Next were those who said: "First there was nothingness, then came life, and life swiftly turned to death."
They took nothingness as the head, life as the body, and death as the corpse.
Whoever knows the one who guards the unity of existence, nothingness, death, and life—I befriend him.
**Exegesis:** Those below this, their minds gradually aligning, first held nothingness, then from nothingness came life, and in an instant, this life perished. Thus they took nothingness as the head, life as the body, and death as the corpse. Whoever knows the non-duality of existence, nothingness, life, and death and cultivates this unity—Zhuangzi would befriend such a one, yet these are rare indeed.

Though these three differ, they belong to the same clan.
**Commentary:** Some take existence as nothingness, some unify existence, and some equalize distinctions—hence the three.
These three, though some exhaust and some do not, all can keep their breasts free of right and wrong—thus they are called the "public clan."
**Exegesis:** The three refer to taking nothingness as the head, life as the body, and death as the corpse. Within one body, these three differences arise, like the Chu royal house dividing one surname into three clans: the Zhaos, the Jings, and the Qu Yuans. The Zhaos wore caps, the Jings bore them, and the Jia clans were enfeoffed—though not one, they were all of the same lineage.
**Commentary:** Though these four belong to the public clan, they are no longer one—thus the three above are further differentiated.
**Exegesis:** Zhao, Qu, and Jing were the three surnames of the Chu royal clan. In ancient times, Qu Yuan served as the Grand Master of the Three Gates, overseeing the three clans and three surnames—these are they. The text here is abbreviated, hence it speaks only of Zhao and Jing. The royal scions, having grown and come of age, wore robes and bore caps. Each held rank and served in office, their surnames granted by their posts—thus the Jia clans. With achievements recorded, they were enfeoffed with land, their branches spreading—hence they were not one. Like the Dao dividing into existence, nothingness, life, and death, with different kinds and names, the text draws this analogy from within the clan.

Existence is a flaw,
**Commentary:** Merely the gathering of qi.
**Exegesis:** A flaw is a blemish. To call this formless thing "existence" is merely the gathering of qi into a blemish—nothing to be prized.

and yet it is said: "This shifts."
**Commentary:** Once distinctions are made, each takes what it takes as "this." "This" is not constant, hence it "shifts."
**Exegesis:** To divide is to scatter. The Dao has no "that" or "this," yet things have right and wrong. Right and wrong are not fixed, thus they scatter and shift without constancy. The state of this shifting is described below.

I have spoken of this shifting, yet it is not what is spoken.
**Commentary:** The shifting of "this" has already appeared before words.
**Exegesis:** Principles take form in right and wrong, hence they are sometimes spoken. Yet the shifting of right and wrong is not faithful to words.

Nevertheless, it cannot be known.
**Commentary:** If its shifting is not spoken, then its shifting cannot be known—thus it is tentatively spoken.
**Exegesis:** Though right and wrong do not arise from words, without words there would be no way to know right and wrong. Thus, tentatively speaking of right and wrong dispels right and wrong. If names did not rely on words, one would not know the absence of right and wrong in right and wrong.

The sacrificial victim’s limbs are complete—
they can be dismembered, yet cannot be dismembered.
**Commentary:** Each thing has its use.
**Exegesis:** The *la* sacrifice is the great offering. The limbs are the hundred parts of the body. *Gai* means complete, also referring to the ox’s hooves. During the *la* sacrifice, the sacrificial animals are most complete, their four limbs and five organs all arrayed. Once the rites conclude, they are dismembered—here, dismemberment is proper. Yet if the sacrifice is not yet complete, dismemberment would be improper—thus dismemberment is not always proper. This shows that right and wrong, "this" and "not-this," shift without constancy.

The observer of the chamber circles the ancestral temple,
then proceeds to the privy.
**Commentary:** The privy is where one retires.
**Exegesis:** The privy is the retiring place. Once the rites conclude, the officiants feast, the remaining offerings set within the chamber. The observer circles the ancestral temple, then proceeds to the privy.

After feasting for long, one must relieve oneself, so one retreats to the park to urinate. Feasting deems the ancestral temple proper, while urination deems the park proper—right and wrong shift without constancy, so what is truly fixed? The *la* sacrifice reveals that gathering and dispersal are not absolute; the observer of the chamber shows that places are not fixed. Neither admits of right or wrong. This is to illustrate the shifting of "this."

**Commentary:** The ancestral temple is for feasting and banquets; the privy is for retiring to relieve oneself. When one retires to relieve oneself, the propriety of the ancestral temple shifts to the privy. Thus, the shifting of right and wrong—now this, now that—who can keep it constant? Therefore, the perfected person rides these shifts and finds them equal.

Let us speak of the shifting of "this." Life is taken as the root.
**Commentary:** In the transformations of things, there is no moment that is not life—wherever there is life, that is the root.
**Exegesis:** Those who forget life and death are without "this" or "not-this," yet they cling to life and so grasp at "this." If one could relinquish life, where would "this" reside? Thus, the shifting of "this" takes life as its root.

Knowledge is taken as the teacher.
**Commentary:** Though what is known differs, each takes its own knowledge as teacher, thereby riding the shifts of right and wrong.
**Commentary:** To ride right and wrong is to be without right and wrong.
**Exegesis:** Following the mind that takes knowledge as teacher, the mind rides the function of right and wrong—how could one know that the teacher of knowledge, in its inversion of right and wrong, is without right and wrong?

There are indeed names and realities.
**Commentary:** The names and realities of things are indeed each self-possessed.
**Exegesis:** All things, in their multiplicity, are entirely illusory—like straw dogs and the ten thousand images, what names and realities do they truly have? Yet those who invert and misplace them insist there is a fixed order of names and realities.

Thus, one takes oneself as the measure.
**Commentary:** *Zhi* means master. Each thing deems itself right, sufficient to be the master of right and wrong.
**Exegesis:** *Zhi* means master. Deludedly grasping names and realities, one takes oneself as the master of names and realities and so contends over right and wrong.

This leads others to take one as their standard.
**Commentary:** All deem themselves right, so none communicate.
**Exegesis:** *Jie* means ultimate conduct. Having lost the thread of names and realities and clung to right and wrong, one causes the unenlightened to firmly grasp empty names as their standard of conduct.

Thus, one dies to repay one’s standard.
**Commentary:** What one guards is not truly relinquished.
**Exegesis:** Guarding right and wrong to perfect one’s conduct, one clings stubbornly and expects to die holding fast. Such a one deems action wise and inaction foolish, penetration illustrious and obstruction shameful.
**Commentary:** Unable to follow what one encounters and find peace in it.
**Exegesis:** Taking ostentation as wisdom and withdrawal as foolishness, penetration as honor and obstruction as disgrace—how could such a one unite honor and disgrace, obstruction and penetration?

The shifting of "this" belongs to the people of today.
**Commentary:** The people of remote antiquity were without "this" or "not-this"—what shifting could there be?
**Exegesis:** Those who stubbornly grasp names and realities, shifting and clinging to right and wrong, are the shallow and deceptive people of this degenerate age—how could they be the simple and honest men of high antiquity?

This is like the cicada and the young dove, identical in their identity.
**Commentary:** Identical in sharing what they deem identical.
**Exegesis:** The cicada and the young dove deem the bramble and the thorn proper. Their identity in this is not a penetrating vision—those who shift "this" are of this kind. The cicada is identical to the dove, the dove identical to the cicada—thus, identical in their identity.

If one treads on a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, one apologizes with an excuse of carelessness.
**Commentary:** Claiming one’s mistake was inadvertent to apologize.
**Exegesis:** *Ju* means to tread or trample. Trampling the foot of a stranger in the marketplace, one apologizes, saying one was haughty, reckless, and mistaken—it was not intentional.

If it is one’s elder brother, one merely coos in sympathy.
**Commentary:** Speaking softly to console, without apology.
**Exegesis:** Treading on one’s elder brother’s foot, one merely coos in sympathy, not shamed into speech.

If it is one’s parent, one says nothing at all.
**Commentary:** Clearly aware of the natural forbearance.
**Exegesis:** If a father treads on his son’s foot, he remains silent, without needless apology.

Thus, one knows that the exchange of words is empty and insincere. Therefore, it is said: The utmost ritual does not involve others.
**Commentary:** "Does not involve others" means seeing others as oneself. Seeing others as oneself precludes apologies—this is the utmost ritual.
**Exegesis:** From the perspective of both parties, seeing others as oneself means not deeming others external to oneself—what apology could there be? This is the utmost ritual.

The utmost rightness does not treat things as things.
**Commentary:** Each attains its proper place, so things are all oneself.
**Exegesis:** Abandoning both self and things, one subtly attains what is proper—not excluding things as external to oneself, what right or wrong could there be? This is the utmost rightness.

The utmost knowledge does not scheme.
**Commentary:** Knowledge that schemes afterward is not natural knowledge.
**Exegesis:** Illuminating by following one’s nature is not knowledge that schemes—this is the utmost knowledge.

The utmost benevolence has no partiality.
**Commentary:** Like the five viscera, which do not favor one another, yet benevolence is already utmost.
**Exegesis:** Like the hands and feet, which serve one another without conscious intent, yet the function of mutual aid is accomplished—how could there be partiality among them?

The utmost trust dispenses with metal.
**Commentary:** Metal and jade are but the substance of petty trust—utmost trust does away with them.
**Exegesis:** *Pi* means to dispense with. Metal and jade are but the substance of trust—utmost trust discards them.

Shatter the turbulence of the will, untie the knots of the heart, cast off the burdens of virtue, and open the blockages of the Way.
**Exegesis:** *Che* means to shatter. *Bo* means disorder. *Miu* means entanglement. These briefly set forth the terms, which are fully explained below.

Wealth, honor, prominence, dignity, fame, and profit—these six are the turbulence of the will.
**Exegesis:** Glory, wealth, abundance, loftiness, eminence, dignity, reputation, and gain—these six are the instruments that disorder the will.

Appearance, movement, complexion, speech, qi, and intent—these six are the entanglements of the heart.
**Exegesis:** Countenance, motion, facial expression, diction, qi-regulation, and emotion—these six bind and fetter the spirit of the heart. Some versions write *miu* as "delusion," meaning the delusions that ensnare the heart.

Aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—these six are the burdens of virtue.
**Exegesis:** Hatred, craving, elation, wrath, grief, and pleasure—these six are the encumbrances that stifle virtue.

Rejection, pursuit, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability—these six are the blockages of the Way.
**Exegesis:** Discarding, following, demanding, bestowing, deliberation, and competence—these six obscure the true Way.

When these four sets of six are not stirred within the breast, one is upright; upright, one is still; still, one is luminous; luminous, one is empty; empty, one acts without acting yet accomplishes all.
**Commentary:** *Dang* means to stir.
**Exegesis:** When the afflictions of these four sets of six do not agitate the breast, the spirit of the heart is balanced and upright; upright, it attains tranquility; tranquil, it becomes radiant; radiant, it achieves emptiness; empty, it is serene and without action, yet responds to all things without limit.

The Way is what virtue reveres.
**Exegesis:** The Way is the method of cultivation; virtue is the method of engaging others. Valuing the person over the method, one reveres the Way.

Life is the radiance of virtue.
**Exegesis:** The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is to give life; thus, the generation and transformation of the myriad things are the luminous splendor of flourishing virtue.

Nature is the essence of life.
**Exegesis:** *Zhi* means root. The nature of spontaneity is the fundamental endowment of life.

The movement of nature is called *wei*.
**Commentary:** When nature moves of itself, it is called *wei*—this is true *wei*, not contrived action.
**Exegesis:** To move in accord with nature, to act within one’s allotted sphere, is *wei* without being *wei*—not contrived action.

Contrived action is called loss.
**Exegesis:** To be moved by external things, to act from deluded desires beyond one’s nature, is to lose the Way.

Knowing is contact; knowing is planning.
**Exegesis:** To engage with external things and strategize about affairs is called knowing.

What knowing does not know is like a sidelong glance.
**Commentary:** The eye’s ability to see is not knowing how to see and yet seeing; not knowing how to know and yet knowing—this is spontaneity. If one knows and then acts, that knowing is contrived.
**Exegesis:** *Ni* means to glance. The eye’s act of seeing does not know how it sees yet sees, seeing both brightness and darkness. The heart’s ability to know does not know how it knows yet knows, knowing both depth and shallowness. The eye cannot see what it cannot see, nor can the heart know what it cannot know—if there are limits, it is like a sidelong glance.

To act from necessity is called virtue.
**Commentary:** If one could refrain from acting yet acts, that is forced action—thus, one loses.
**Exegesis:** To act only when compelled, in harmony without premeditation, is to employ necessity—this is called flourishing virtue.

To act without self is called order.
**Commentary:** To act by imitating others is disorder.
**Exegesis:** To act in accord with nature, not abandoning the self to mimic others, is to align with right principle—thus, there is no disorder.

Names may oppose one another, yet realities accord.
**Commentary:** With the distinction of self and other, there is opposition; each attaining its reality, there is accord.
**Exegesis:** With the names of self and other, right and wrong, there is opposition; without the realities of self and other, right and wrong, there is accord in reality.

Yi was skilled at hitting the subtle yet clumsy at preventing others from praising him.
**Commentary:** Being skilled at hitting the mark naturally brings praise—this is the constant principle.
**Exegesis:** Yi was a master archer of antiquity. *Gong* means skill. Yi drew his bow and loosed his arrows, skillfully striking distant targets, mastering the subtleties of archery. Yet possessing such skill, he could not prevent himself from earning renown—praise was unavoidable!

The sage is skilled at Heaven yet clumsy at humanity.
**Commentary:** Following spontaneity is Heaven; acting with intention is humanity.
**Exegesis:** The preceding serves as analogy; this is the synthesis. The sage perfectly aligns with spontaneity, his merit equaling that of creation, yet the myriad beings go about their daily lives unaware—his subtlety is not displayed. As the earlier text says, "Making the world forget the self is difficult." Thus, to be skilled at Heaven and clumsy at humanity is possible only for the *quanren*.

One who is skilled at Heaven is clumsy at humanity—this is the *quanren*.
**Commentary:** To be skilled at Heaven is to be clumsy at humanity—this is the *quanren*, the *quanren* being the sage.
**Exegesis:** The *quanren*—the perfected person, the spirit person—harmonizes with spontaneity, excels at obscuring his traces, and benefits all generations without their awareness. Is this not the spirit person? The spirit person has no merit, hence his ability.

Only the creature can be creaturely; only the creature can be Heavenly.
**Commentary:** To return to and guard simplicity is to be Heavenly.
**Exegesis:** Birds fly and beasts run—this is being creaturely; spiders weave webs and bees form combs—this is being Heavenly. All are the workings of creation—how could they be the result of imitation?

Does the *quanren* despise Heaven? Does he despise the Heaven in others?
**Exegesis:** The *quanren* of perfect virtue, whose spiritual merit is unobtrusive, would he resent his own natural endowment and despise what others have received? Surely not—he simply follows and accords with spontaneity.

How much less would he distinguish between my Heaven and others’ humanity!
**Commentary:** To be utterly unaware and yet follow it—this is called being skilled at Heaven.
**Exegesis:** Whether Heaven or humanity, he does not perceive their difference—he simply follows them all.

You yourself abandon the distinctions between Heaven and humanity’s beauty and ugliness—yet Heaven and humanity still remain. Here, one may merge Heaven and humanity, no longer perceiving their difference.

*Wu* (吾) is the hypothetical self-reference of the discourse’s master.

A sparrow alights near Yi—Yi will surely take it, by force.
**Commentary:** Force seizes things, yet things must flee it.
**Exegesis:** Suppose a sparrow comes near Yi, who is skilled in archery—he will inevitably hit it. Thus, when one extinguishes ferocity, ferocity does not arise from virtue or wisdom; what is gained is little, what escapes is much. To govern the world by force is the same.

If one takes all under Heaven as Heaven’s cage, then no sparrow can escape.
**Commentary:** All things under Heaven have their own desires; when each obtains what it desires, where can escape lie?
**Exegesis:** The great Dao is vast and boundless, encompassing all—thus it is likened to a cage of Heaven and Earth. From this, we know that seizing things by force deeply contravenes the great workings of creation.

Therefore, Tang used a kitchen servant to enclose Yi Yin, and Duke Mu of Qin used five sheep hides to enclose Bai Li Xi.
**Exegesis:** Yi Yin was a dowry servant of the Youxin clan, skilled in seasoning the tripod; he carried a jade tripod to seek audience with Tang. Tang, recognizing his worth and following his nature, thus used the kitchen to enclose him. Bai Li Xi was enslaved among the Di; the Di people prized sheep hides, so Duke Mu of Qin ransomed him with five-colored sheep hides. It is also said: Bai Li Xi favored wearing robes of five-colored sheep hides, hence his title, "Grandee of the Five Rams." Both Tang the sagely and Mu the worthy, in their love of worthies, obtained these two men and employed them as fine ministers—all by following their original natures to enclose them.

Thus, there is nothing that cannot be enclosed by what one desires.

**Exegesis:** By following what one desires, there is nothing in the world that is difficult; to enclose by opposing one’s original nature—this has never been achieved. The maimed take pride in lavish adornment, yet externally, they invite neither praise nor blame.
**Annotation:** *Adornment* refers to what embellishes one’s appearance. The appearance of the mutilated is already marred; thus, they no longer hold beauty or ugliness in their hearts, and so they are cast aside.
**Exegesis:** *Maimed* refers to those who have suffered amputation. *Cast aside* means to discard. *Adornment* refers to finery, the embellishment of attire meant to enhance one’s bearing. For those whose forms are broken by mutilation, matters of praise or shame no longer reside in their hearts, and so they are discarded.
The convict laborer ascends heights without fear, having abandoned life and death.
**Annotation:** Having no attachment to life, he does not fear death.
**Exegesis:** *Convict laborer* refers to one bound in servitude. The son of a thousand golds values his own person, but the bondsman does not hold his life dear. Having no care for himself, he climbs perilous heights without dread.
To revert to one’s nature and yet forget others,
**Annotation:** Unaware of what others cherish.
**Exegesis:** *Forgiveness* (or *shame*, depending on the character) is read accordingly. To return to one’s original nature and complete it through such means is to refuse to imitate others, thus forsaking gratitude and repayment—this is to forget the way of human relations. It is like the hands and feet, which serve their functions in mutual reliance; do they express thanks for one another’s use? To forget others is thus to become one with Heaven.
**Annotation:** Without human sentiment, one naturally becomes a being of Heaven.
**Exegesis:** Following the nature of Heaven’s Dao, forgetting the sentiments of human ways, one thereby aligns with the principle of spontaneity.
Thus, those who are revered yet feel no joy, and those who are insulted yet feel no anger—only those in harmony with Heaven’s harmony are so.
**Annotation:** Even the mutilated and the convict laborer attain harmony with Heaven’s harmony—how much more so the natural harmony of Heaven itself?
**Exegesis:** In harmony with Heaven’s harmony, one forgets opposition and compliance; thus, reverence brings no joy, and insult brings no anger.
Anger that arises from non-anger is anger born of non-anger; action that arises from non-action is action born of non-action.
**Annotation:** This is the meaning of the non-existent giving rise to the existent, and non-action giving rise to action.
**Exegesis:** Those who produce anger or action do not do so from a state of non-anger or non-action; thus, they arise from non-anger and non-action. Therefore, know that action is rooted in non-action, and anger in non-anger. To embody this principle is to be insulted yet feel no anger.
To still the mind, calm the qi; to attain spirit, follow the heart—this is action. To be fitting, yield to necessity; the way of the sage lies in necessity.
**Annotation:** Calming the qi brings stillness; fulfilling the heart’s principle brings spiritual attainment; yielding to necessity ensures all actions are fitting. Thus, the sage takes this as the Dao—how could he seek non-action beyond the indistinct and evanescent?
**Exegesis:** *Yield* means to follow. To still the mind, one must regulate the will and qi; for spiritual transformation, nothing precedes following the heart’s essence. To harmonize within action and yet be fitting in principle, one must follow necessity. *Necessity* means responding only after being moved, acting within one’s proper role. Such examples are what the sage employs as the true Dao.

*Annotations to the Southern Florescence Scripture*, Scroll Twenty-Six
Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan

**Tang Dynasty Master of Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying’s Subcommentary**

**Miscellaneous Chapters, "Xu Wugui" Twenty-Four**

Xu Wugui, through Nü Shang, had an audience with Marquis Wu of Wei.

*Subcommentary:* His surname was Xu, his courtesy name Wugui—he was a recluse. Her surname was Nü, her given name Shang, a chief minister of Wei. Marquis Wu was the son of Marquis Wen and the eighth-generation descendant of Bi Wan. Wugui wished to admonish Marquis Wu, so he borrowed the minister’s position to gain an audience.

Marquis Wu greeted him, saying: "Master, you must be weary."

*Subcommentary:* Having long dwelled in the mountains and forests, enduring hardship and poverty, he had now deigned to lower himself and mingle among the vulgar. The marquis was inwardly delighted and offered words of consolation.

Xu Wugui said: "I am weary on your account—what weariness have you for me? If you indulge your desires to excess, if you perpetuate your likes and dislikes, then the true nature of life and destiny will sicken. If you cast aside desires and temper your likes and dislikes, then your ears and eyes will sicken."

*Annotation:* Desires, likes, and dislikes—there is no fitting them, whether inwardly or outwardly.

*Subcommentary:* *Chu* means to discard; *xue* means to restrain. If your desires overflow and your likes and dislikes grow unchecked, the essence of life and spirit will be exhausted and afflicted. If you banish old desires and learn to set aside likes and dislikes, failing to accord with what is fitting, then your ears and eyes will sicken. Thus, I come to console you—what leisure do you have to weary me? I weary on your account—what weariness have you for me?

*Subcommentary:* This reiterates the preceding meaning.

Marquis Wu remained aloof and did not respond.

*Annotation:* He was displeased with his words.

*Subcommentary:* *Chao* means resentment. Since the words did not suit his disposition, he remained silent and did not answer.

After a while, Xu Wugui said: "I once told you—I read the signs in dogs."

*Subcommentary:* Sensing that Marquis Wu was displeased and sullen, he tested him with talk of dogs and horses, hoping to please his heart.

Those of the lowest quality stop when their bellies are full—this is the virtue of the wildcat.

*Subcommentary:* Clinging to their nature and will, they care only for a full stomach. In form and substance, their virtue is that of the fox or wildcat—dogs of the lowest rank.

Those of middling quality are like one gazing at the sun.

*Subcommentary:* Their spirit soars high, their gaze like one beholding the sun. In form and substance, they are as such—dogs of the middle rank.

Those of the highest quality seem to have forgotten themselves.

*Subcommentary:* They do not cling to their bodies. With settled and composed spirit, they seem to have lost themselves—dogs of the highest rank.

"I read the signs in dogs, yet this is not as good as reading the signs in horses."

*Subcommentary:* Dogs have three ranks, horses several grades, yet the skill in reading dogs does not surpass that in reading horses. Since Marquis Wu was crude and vulgar, Wugui used this to provoke his interest, hoping to please him and perhaps guide him toward the right path.

"I read the signs in horses: the straight ones meet the plumb line."

*Subcommentary:* This refers to the horse’s front teeth.

"The curved ones meet the hook."

*Subcommentary:* This refers to the horse’s neck.

"The square ones meet the carpenter’s square."

*Subcommentary:* This refers to the horse’s head.

"The round ones meet the compass."

*Subcommentary:* This refers to the horse’s eyes.

"These are the horses of a state."

*Subcommentary:* Those matching the above signs are the finest horses of a feudal lord’s domain.

"Yet they do not compare to the horses of the world. The horses of the world possess innate talent."

*Subcommentary:* Their virtue is naturally complete, requiring no training. These are the finest horses under heaven, fit for the Son of Heaven to ride.

"They seem anxious, as if lost; they seem to have forgotten themselves."

*Subcommentary:* Their eyes seem to glance about, as if troubled; their hooves move slowly, as if fleeing. Observing their spirit, they seem to have forgotten their bodies. Such is the quality of the Son of Heaven’s horses.

"Such horses surpass all others, leaving dust far behind—their origin is unknown."

*Subcommentary:* *Yi* means to surpass. Their gallop is swift, outpacing all other horses, as rapid as the wind, with dust left far behind. Since they are not trained, their source is unknown."

Marquis Wu was greatly pleased and laughed.

*Annotation:* How could the words of a true person be anything but fitting? They are only as good as what the thing itself desires.

*Subcommentary:* His words struck the right chord, so the marquis laughed with delight.

Xu Wugui departed. Nü Shang said: "Master, how did you alone manage to please our lord?"

*Subcommentary:* Having concluded their discussion, he took his leave. Nü Shang, surprised by the marquis’s joy, asked Wugui about it.

"The way I pleased our lord: broadly speaking, I spoke to him of the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*; narrowly speaking, I spoke to him of the *Golden Tablets* and *Six Strategies*."

*Subcommentary:* The *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*—the Six Classics. The *Golden Tablets* and *Six Strategies*—chapter names from the *Book of Zhou*, or perhaps secret teachings. One version writes *tao* instead, reading it as the military methods of the Grand Duke, referring to the *Six Strategies* of the Tiger, Leopard, Dragon, and Dog. *Heng* means distant; *zong* means near. Since Marquis Wu favored martial arts and disdained civil matters, Wugui treated military strategy as the near approach and the Six Classics as the distant one.

"Those who have served him with great merit are beyond counting, yet our lord has never once smiled. Now, master, how did you please our lord so that he is delighted like this?"

*Subcommentary:* Those who have served Marquis Wu with utmost loyalty, offering counsel on what is fitting or not, their achievements manifest—such men are beyond counting, yet our lord has never once opened his mouth to smile. What art did you employ to bring our lord such joy?

Xu Wugui said: "I simply told him of my reading of dogs and horses."

*Subcommentary:* Medicine, however cheap, is good if it cures the illness. Thus, he spoke directly of dogs and horses, saying nothing more.

Nü Shang said: "Is that so?"

*Subcommentary:* Did you truly only speak of dogs and horses? Surprised by the shallowness of his words, he asked this.

He said: "Have you not heard of the exiles of Yue?"

Far from his state for several days, he rejoices upon seeing those he knows—
*Annotation:* Each follows the inclinations of his own nature.
*Subcommentary:* Exiled far from his homeland, whether for transgressing the law or suffering harsh governance, he has barely bid farewell to his native soil when, after only a few days, he suddenly encounters an acquaintance—how could he not be overjoyed? This begins the analogy.

Far from his state for a month, he rejoices upon seeing those he once saw within the state—
*Subcommentary:* As the days and months pass, longing for home grows deeper. Though they may not be acquaintances, if he sees someone he once knew in his homeland, he greets them with delight.

After a full year, he rejoices even upon seeing someone who merely resembles a fellow countryman. Is it not true that the longer one is parted from others, the deeper the longing for them?
*Annotation:* When each attains what he desires, there is no longing; without longing, he forgets the very reason for his joy.
*Subcommentary:* After a year away from his state, the distance grows greater, so that even upon seeing someone who resembles a fellow villager, he is overjoyed. Is this not because, as separation from home lengthens, yearning only deepens? This is likened to Marquis Wu, whose nature delights in dogs and horses. Having long been estranged from matters of governance, he is like one far from home—suddenly hearing talk of such things brings him joy.

One who flees into the void, blocking the paths of moles and weasels with brambles and beams, treading upon emptiness, rejoices upon hearing the sound of footsteps in the hall. How much more, then, would he rejoice at the voices of brothers and kin drinking and laughing at his side?
*Annotation:* When one attains the utmost joy, great delight follows.
*Subcommentary:* *Zhu* means to block; *gen* means to tread; *tang* refers to the sound of footsteps. In times of turmoil and famine, one flees in desperation to an abandoned estate, where only reeds and wild grasses block the gates, and the paths of foxes and weasels lie before him. If, in the vast emptiness of the hall, he suddenly hears the sound of footsteps, he is already overjoyed—how much more would he rejoice at the voices of brothers and kin drinking and laughing beside him? This deepens the analogy.

For too long, no one has offered the words of a true person to awaken our lord at his side.
*Annotation:* This is why he has never once smiled. The words of a true person resonate with our lord’s nature; at first, he delights in them, but with time, he forgets them.
*Subcommentary:* Marquis Wu’s longing to hear of dogs and horses has endured for some time, like an exile growing ever more weary. After such prolonged hardship, he yearns for home. Yet now, when the true person speaks of the *Six Classics* or the military strategies of the Grand Duke, his words ring out at the lord’s side—this is not what he desires. This completes the earlier analogy.

When Xu Wugui met Marquis Wu, the marquis said: "Master, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating taro and chestnuts, weary of onions and leeks. You have come to visit this lonely one—how long it has been! Are you now old? Do you crave the taste of wine and meat? Or does this lonely one possess some blessing for the altars of state?"

*Subcommentary:* *Gan* means to seek. Having long dwelled in the mountains, subsisting on vegetables and fruits, with age comes weariness—would he not seek richer flavors to sustain his declining years? Perhaps he comes to secure the ancestral temples through virtue.

Xu Wugui said: "Wugui was born in poverty and lowliness. I have never dared to partake of my lord’s wine and meat. I have come to offer you solace."

*Subcommentary:* Born in humble circumstances, content in the wilderness, how could I seek sustenance from your food and drink? That is not my purpose. I have come to offer you solace."

The ruler said: "Why? How would you offer solace to this lonely one?"

*Subcommentary:* *Why* means *for what reason*. He asks the purpose of his coming.

Xu Wugui said: "To ease the strain upon your spirit and form."

*Subcommentary:* Gluttony without restraint wearies the body and exhausts the spirit—thus I offer solace.

Marquis Wu said: "What do you mean?"

*Subcommentary:* He asks what these words intend.

Xu Wugui said: "The nurture of Heaven and Earth is one.

*Annotation:* They do not indulge the ruler without limit.

*Subcommentary:* The Two Modes of Heaven and Earth nourish all beings. Their sustenance is universal and impartial, never indulging a ruler’s excess. These are the words with which Xu Wugui offers solace.

One who ascends to high station cannot be called tall; one who dwells in lowliness cannot be called short. Yet you alone, as lord of ten thousand chariots, afflict an entire nation’s people to feed your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth.

*Annotation:* This violates the balance of Heaven and Earth.

*Subcommentary:* To rise to high rank as a nobleman is no cause to delight in it as a lasting state; to dwell in humble station as one of the common folk is no cause to suffer it as a permanent lack. Yet you alone boast of your ten-thousand-chariot might, oppressing the people of this land to demand sights, sounds, scents, and flavors for the indulgence of your senses. This defies the intent of Heaven and Earth—I cannot approve of it.

The spirit does not claim for itself.

*Annotation:* It is bestowed by things.

*Subcommentary:* *Claim* means *to take*. The sage-ruler and spirit-person treat all things equally, never demanding rich flavors for their own indulgence.

The spirit delights in harmony and detests deceit.

*Annotation:* To share with all things is harmony; to claim for oneself is deceit.

*Subcommentary:* The spirit-person delights in harmonizing with things and detests deceitful self-interest.

Deceit is a malady—thus I offer solace. Why does only my lord suffer from it?"

*Subcommentary:* Deceit is a private indulgence, a malady in principle. That you alone are afflicted—how grievous is your plight?

Marquis Wu said: "I have long wished to meet you. I desire to cherish the people, practice righteousness, and lay down arms—would this be acceptable?"

*Subcommentary:* He wishes to enact benevolent nurture and righteous correction, refining civil governance and stilling the weapons of war. With such a mode of rule, he asks whether it would be fitting.

Xu Wugui said: "It would not. To cherish the people is the beginning of harming them.

*Annotation:* The path of cherishing the people becomes what the people esteem. What is esteemed as cherishing is already false.

To practice righteousness and lay down arms is the root of raising arms.

*Annotation:* To practice righteousness is to make one’s name conspicuous; a conspicuous name invites competition, and competition leads to the loss of one’s true nature.

Father and son, ruler and minister, harboring feelings, deceive one another. Even if you wished to lay down arms, how could it be achieved?

*Subcommentary:* Partial benevolence, righteous correction, the stilling of arms, the refinement of culture—once these are made manifest, things will vie to emulate them. The harming of the people and the raising of arms begin here. If you proceed thus, it will surely fail.

*Annotation:* Only by acting from non-action can it succeed.

*Subcommentary:* *Proceed* means *to follow*. *Surely* means *nearly*. To follow this course is to nearly destroy the root of non-action, thus it will nearly fail.

All that perfects beauty is a vessel of evil.

*Annotation:* When beauty is perfected beforehand, falsity arises afterward. Thus, what perfects beauty is a vessel of evil.

*Subcommentary:* When good deeds are perfected in advance, their beauty becomes conspicuous, and things will vie to emulate them—thus it becomes an instrument of evil.

Though you practice benevolence and righteousness, you will nearly verge upon falsity.

*Annotation:* The people will judge it as false and will not accept it as genuine.

*Subcommentary:* *Nearly* means *close to*. When benevolence and righteousness are made manifest, all things lose their true nature—thus you verge upon the root of falsity.

Form inevitably gives rise to form.

*Annotation:* Where there is form, false form is inevitably produced.

*Subcommentary:* The paths of benevolence and righteousness both possess form. Thus, when one advances along them, false forms are inevitably produced in their wake.

Perfection inevitably invites attack.

*Annotation:* Perfection is conspicuous.

*Subcommentary:* When achievements and fame are perfected, they inevitably invite competition—thus they invite attack.

Change inevitably provokes external conflict.

*Annotation:* It loses its constant nature.

*Subcommentary:* When laws and institutions are created and the constant is altered, things will be harmed—thus external enemies arise, and affairs often lead to conflict.

You must not array ranks of cranes in the towering watchtowers,

*Annotation:* *Crane ranks* refers to the deployment of troops. *Towering watchtowers* are high towers.

nor station swift steeds in the palaces of the ancestral altars.

*Annotation:* Infantry are called *foot soldiers*.

Do not practice righteousness or cherish the people—also, do not deploy vast armies or gallop horses.

*Subcommentary:* *Crane ranks* refers to the deployment of troops, likening their formation to the ranks of cranes. *Towering watchtowers* are high towers, resplendent and lofty. *Ancestral altars* is the name of a palace. Do not set your mind on stilling arms through righteousness, nor deploy vast armies beneath the high towers or station swift steeds within the palace grounds.

Do not harbor resentment in your gains.

*Annotation:* If resentment lies within gain, it is lost.

*Subcommentary:* Do not conceal a resentful heart while grasping at gain.

Do not seek to outwit others,

*Annotation:* Preserve your simplicity, and each will have its own ability—thus there is balance.

*Subcommentary:* The greatest skill appears clumsy; each abides in simplicity. Do not use cunning to compete with others.

do not seek to outscheme others,

*Annotation:* Follow your true knowledge, and each will have its own strength—thus there is equality.

*Subcommentary:* Abandon calculation and follow your direct knowledge. Do not use schemes to outmaneuver others.

do not seek to outfight others.

*Annotation:* Respond to things with the Dao, and things will submit without the name of victory.

*Subcommentary:* First cultivate emptiness and tranquility, submitting others with the Dao. Do not seek to conquer others through warfare.

Those who kill others’ people, seize others’ lands, to nourish their own selfishness and their own spirits—how can one know which side is truly good in such a war?"

Where does the evil of victory lie?
*Annotation:* If one does not know what is truly good, then even conquest is not one’s own victory.
*Subcommentary:* To respond to Heaven and follow the people, even if one destroys the cruel and eliminates the rebellious, though a state may fall and lives be taken, one does not lose the people’s joyful hearts. But if one slays the people, seizes their lands, and acts with the intent to demand tribute, selfishly nourishing one’s own body and pleasing one’s own heart—though one may conquer the enemy and prevail over others, one does not know where this victory lies, nor in whom the good truly resides.

If you, O ruler, cannot cease, then cultivate the sincerity within your breast to respond to the feelings of Heaven and Earth, and do not disturb.
*Annotation:* If you cannot cease, then cultivate your own sincerity.
*Subcommentary:* Sincerity is reality. Disturbance is disorder. If affairs cannot be halted and governance is necessary, then cultivate the reality within your heart, respond to the life and death of the Two Modes, and do not trouble yourself with laws that disturb the common people.

The people have already escaped death—why would you, O ruler, need to employ the laying down of arms?
*Annotation:* When armor and weapons are not arrayed, it is not that they are laid down.
*Subcommentary:* In great accord with Heaven and Earth, transformation is enacted without intent. The people, having overcome cruelty, escape injury and death—why labor to devise laws for laying down arms?

The Yellow Emperor was about to visit Great Purity on Mount Jutci,
*Subcommentary:* The Yellow Emperor was Xuanyuan. *Great Purity* refers to the vastness and emptiness of the great Dao. It may also refer to *Great Purity*, an ancient perfected person. *Jutci* is the name of a mountain, located in the borderlands of Mi County in Yingyang, also called Mount Taipo.

A sage, long steeped in the profoundest principles, he sought to inquire into the mysterious Dao and thus journeyed to Mount Jutci. Fangming served as his charioteer, Changyu rode alongside, Zhangruo and Peng led the vanguard, while Kunhe and Guji followed in the rear carriage.
*Subcommentary:* Fangming, Guji, and the others were all names of individuals. Those on the right served as attendants, those on the left as charioteers. The vanguard rode ahead of the horses, while the rear carriage followed behind.

When they reached the wilds of Xiangcheng, the two and seven sages all became lost, with no one to ask for directions.
*Annotation:* The sages were named; names arise and things become confused. Though one may seek Great Purity, how can it be attained?
*Subcommentary:* *Directions* means the Way. Today’s Xuchang has a Xiangcheng County, located south of Mount Taipo, where the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao. From the Yellow Emperor up to Guji, there were in total seven sages. The annotation states: “The sages were named; names arise and things become confused. Though one may seek Great Purity, how can it be attained?” This annotation is apt; I now offer a further explanation.

They happened upon a boy herding horses and asked him for directions.
*Subcommentary:* The boy herding horses was an attained person. He herded horses by day and herded them still. By chance, they encountered the herdboy and thus inquired about the whereabouts of the Dao.

“Do you know of Mount Jutci?”
“Indeed,” he replied.
*Subcommentary:* *You* means “you.” *Indeed* means “yes.” They asked about the location of the mountain, and he answered that he knew it.

“Do you know where Great Purity resides?”
“Indeed,” he replied.
*Subcommentary:* *Resides* means “is located.” They again asked about the whereabouts of the Dao, and he answered that he knew the place.

The Yellow Emperor said, “How extraordinary, this little boy! Not only does he know of Mount Jutci, but he also knows where Great Purity resides. I beg to ask how to govern the world.”
*Subcommentary:* The Emperor marveled at the herdboy’s knowledge of the Dao’s whereabouts and thus asked how to order the realm.

The little boy said, “Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do?”
*Annotation:* If each is as it is, then there is nothing to do; only with nothing to do can one govern the world.
*Subcommentary:* *What more* means “why.” *Like this* means “as such.” If one wishes to govern the world, it is like governing the self. Since the self is without action, what affairs are there for things? Thus the *Laozi* says, “I do nothing, and the people transform themselves.”

“From my youth, I have wandered within the Six Directions. Then I contracted a dizzying illness. An elder taught me, saying: ‘If you ride the chariot of the sun and wander the wilds of Xiangcheng…’”
*Annotation:* One wanders at sunrise and rests at sunset.
*Subcommentary:* *Within the Six Directions* refers to the dusty world. *Dizzying illness* means vertigo and confusion. I say: in my youth, I wandered the realm of the profound Dao, dwelling beyond the dust and grime, yet I suffered from dizziness and could not embody the true. Fortunately, a sage taught me to cultivate the Dao, acting by day and resting by night, riding the sun’s chariot to wander and thus dwell in ease, carefree in the world. Some versions have the character *chariot*, meaning to ride the sun’s renewal in transformation. Now that my illness has slightly improved, I will once more wander beyond the Six Directions. Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do?”

“To govern the world, nothing surpasses self-abandonment; once self-abandoned, what can things constrain? Thus, I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves.”

*Annotation:* *痊* means “to remove.” The illness of delusion has long since been dispelled; one wanders beyond the dust, the heart roaming outside things. Governing the body and governing the state—how are they different? Self and things merge in mutual accord, so there is nothing to be done.

The Yellow Emperor said: “To govern the world is truly not your affair.”

*Annotation:* Affairs arise from the people.

“Nevertheless, I ask how to govern the world.”

*Annotation:* Let the people find their own way—this is the essential Dao.

*Subcommentary:* To shepherd and nourish the common folk is not the sage’s true task. Though the principle is thus, he still requests the essential teaching.

*Small Lad declines to speak.*

*Subcommentary:* There is nothing to be said.

The Yellow Emperor asks again.

*Subcommentary:* Earnestly entreating the Small Lad.

The Small Lad said: “To govern the world—how is it different from herding horses? Simply remove what harms the horses, and that is all.”

*Annotation:* Horses are harmed by excess.

*Subcommentary:* What harms horses are matters beyond their proper measure. In cultivating the self, nothing comes before guarding one’s proper measure; thus, the art of herding horses can nurture the people. Since the question was earnest, I offer this answer in passing.”

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and withdrew, calling him “Heavenly Master.”

The Master removes what exceeds nature, and the great spirit arrives.

*Subcommentary:* Suddenly awakening to the sage’s words, he cherishes body and mind, retreats from what lies beyond his measure, and attains the great spirit, aligning with the Dao of naturalness—this lies in our Master.

The man of knowledge finds no joy without the changes of thought and deliberation.

*Subcommentary:* In an age of peril and calamity, when misfortune strikes, the man of foresight thinks and deliberates; if not, he finds no joy.

The man of eloquence finds no joy without the order of discourse.

*Subcommentary:* Words flow like rivers, arguments turn like roasting spits; without the proper beginning for discourse, he finds no delight.

The man of discernment finds no joy without the thrust and parry of debate.

*Subcommentary:* The keen and perceptive man, if denied the exchange of host and guest, the clash of words, finds no joy.

All are confined by things.

*Annotation:* Unable to find fulfillment within, they seek joy in external things, and so may be confined.

Thus, each is confined by what brings him joy, and the myriad things come unbidden—not by force.

*Subcommentary:* These men, each with their biases, have yet to grasp the great norm; all are bounded by things.

The man who summons the age serves the court.

*Subcommentary:* He who recommends the loyal and gathers men of worth may take his place in the court.

The man of the common people honors office.

*Subcommentary:* Governing the four classes with balance and fairness, this man of keen judgment and defined role may honor his office.

The man of sinew and strength boasts of hardship.

*Subcommentary:* The stalwart hero, strong as a tiger, when hardship arises, devotes himself to saving the age.

The brave man rushes to peril.

*Subcommentary:* The martial and resolute man, roused to valor, sweeps away disaster.

The man of arms delights in war.

*Subcommentary:* He whose heart loves weapons and whose will dwells on blades delights in battle.

The ascetic cherishes his name.

*Subcommentary:* Living on little, clad in coarse cloth, his form gaunt, his mind fixed on rest, he dwells only on his reputation.

The man of laws expands governance.

*Subcommentary:* The man of punishments, attentive to statutes, punishing evil and encouraging good, governs broadly.

The man of ritual reveres appearance.

*Subcommentary:* In the refinements of ritual, he esteems dignified bearing.

The man of benevolence and righteousness values opportunity.

*Annotation:* Since men differ thus, he who encounters them must not alter his course.

*Subcommentary:* When the world offers occasion and the time presents opportunity, he practices benevolence and righteousness to establish his renown.

The farmer finds no harmony without the work of clearing fields; the merchant finds no harmony without the work of the marketplace.

*Annotation:* When their work is the same, they are in harmony.

*Subcommentary:* *Bi* means harmony. In ancient times, markets were held by the well, hence "marketplace." If they stray from their proper work, their hearts cannot be at peace.

The common people are encouraged by their daily tasks.

*Annotation:* When their work aligns with their aspirations, they are encouraged.

*Subcommentary:* The multitude, each with their duties, content from dawn to dusk, thus spur themselves on.

The hundred craftsmen take pride in the skill of their tools.

*Annotation:* Without their proper skill, they grow idle.

*Subcommentary:* *Zhuang* means flourishing. The hundred craftsmen, each with their tools, when they follow their nature, their work flourishes.

The greedy grow anxious when wealth does not accumulate.

*Annotation:* When things accord with their desires, they rejoice.

The boastful grow sorrowful when power does not stand out.

*Subcommentary:* *You* means extreme. The covetous man gathers wealth to suit his nature; the proud man borrows power to please his heart. If things run counter to their nature, sorrow and grief arise.

The followers of power and things delight in change.

*Annotation:* Power arises from changing circumstances.

*Subcommentary:* When disaster strikes, power becomes extreme; thus, those who wield power over things delight in calamity.

When the time offers use, they cannot be without action.

*Annotation:* Each of these men has their moment; when the time calls, they cannot restrain themselves. If the time does not come, though they wish to act, how can they?

Thus, nobility and baseness have no constancy.

*Subcommentary:* The men described above, meeting their fate, their hearts shifting with events, cannot be without action.

All follow in harmony with the seasons, not altering with change.

*Annotation:* Each man’s abilities have their limit, like the four seasons, which cannot be altered. Thus, when their time and things come, following their proper order, each has their use.

Therefore, following the seasons brings timely order; altering one’s nature fails to accord with things. To accord with things yet not be bound by them—how could this be destruction?

*Subcommentary:* *Bi* means sequence. Men’s actions have strengths and weaknesses; their use follows the time, their success has order, like the seasons’ heat and cold, unchanging in their course. "Not according with things" means not altering with things. To gallop one’s form and nature, sinking into the myriad things, never to return—how sad!

*Annotation:* Not holding to one skill but chasing the ten thousand directions for fleeting gain, some crawl back in the end—this is why it is sad.

*Subcommentary:* Racing mind and body, drowning in external things, until the end of life, never returning—so stubborn and foolish, deeply pitiable indeed!

Zhuangzi said: If an archer hits the mark without aiming, is he a good shot? Then all under heaven could be Yi—is that acceptable?

*Annotation:* Hitting without aiming means an accidental hit, not a good shot. If we call an accidental hit good shooting, then all under heaven could be called Yi—is that acceptable? It is not.

*Subcommentary:* *Qi* means the target.

If an archer hits a target without aiming and accidentally strikes something, and we call this good shooting—is that acceptable? Master Hui said: It is.

*Subcommentary:* This would mean all under heaven are Yi.

Zhuangzi said: There is no universal rightness in the world, yet each takes their own rightness as right—then all under heaven could be Yao. Is that acceptable?

*Annotation:* If we call an accidental hit Yi, then those who privately affirm their own views could also be called Yao.

Zhuangzi uses this to show that accidental hits are not Yi, and self-affirmation is not Yao.

*Subcommentary:* Each clings to their own rightness, so there is no universal rightness. Yet Yao, the sage, is right when contrasted with Jie. If each takes their own rightness as right, then all are sages—is that acceptable? It is not.

Master Hui said: It is.

*Subcommentary:* If each affirms their own rightness, then all under heaven are Yao—this is logically possible, yet Hui Shi, mired in sophistry, speaks without substance.

Zhuangzi said: Then if the Ru, Mo, Yang, and Bing—four schools—are joined with you, making five, which one is truly right?

*Annotation:* If all are Yao, why do these five mutually reject one another?

*Subcommentary:* Ru refers to Zheng Huan. Mo refers to Mo Di. Yang refers to Yang Zhu. Bing is the courtesy name of Gongsun Long. These four, along with Hui Shi, making five, each surpass others in wisdom, towering in eloquence, yet they dispute one another’s rightness—how can we determine who is correct? If all under heaven were Yao, why would these five still reject one another? Or are they like Lu Ju?

His disciple said: I have grasped the Master’s Dao! I can boil a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer.

*Subcommentary:* Lu Ju, a man of the early Zhou, claimed that in winter, one could take thousand-year-old dry ashes to kindle fire, instantly producing flames to heat a cauldron; in summer, one could boil water in an earthen jar, then suspend it in a well, and in moments, ice would form. Yet the deluded world, lost in self-affirmation, differs little from this.

Lu Ju said: This merely summons yang with yang and yin with yin—it is not what I call the Dao.

*Subcommentary:* Thousand-year ashes are yang, and fire is also yang—this is summoning yang with yang. The well is yin, and water is also yin—this is summoning yin with yin. Lu Ju’s words refute his disciple. I will show you the true Dao.

Then he tuned the se for demonstration. One he set in the hall, another in the chamber. When he plucked the *gong* note, the *gong* string resonated; when he plucked the *jiao* note, the *jiao* string resonated—their tones were in harmony.

*Annotation:* This, too, is summoning yang with yang, yet they stubbornly claim it as right.

*Subcommentary:* *Fei* means "to place." One se was placed in the hall, another in the chamber. When the *gong* or *jiao* string in the hall was plucked, the corresponding string in the chamber would vibrate in response, for the five notes and six pitches share the same sound. Yet this remains summoning yang with yang. If one were to adjust a single string so that it no longer aligned with the five notes—

*Annotation:* Changing it according to the tuning.

*Subcommentary:* If a string in the hall were retuned, the strings in the chamber would no longer respond, for their pitches would no longer match. Yet when that single string was plucked, all twenty-five strings would vibrate—

*Annotation:* Without sound, there would be no resonance; with sound, only harmony elicits response. Now, by altering this one string, all twenty-five strings change, for the tuning depends on tension and slack.

*Subcommentary:* The response was once limited to *gong* and *jiao*, but now all twenty-five strings resonate, for all whose pitches match will respond. Yet this differs not from sound itself, and the ruler of tones is already established.

*Annotation:* Lu Ju used this to boast to his disciple, but it is merely like responding to like—nothing uniquely his own.

*Subcommentary:* Beyond the laws of sound, there is no other art. Though the responses differ, all are governed by the five notes as their sovereign. Lacking any other defense, what is there to boast of? Is this not the same?

*Annotation:* Each of the five masters clings to his own views and deems them right, yet they differ not from Lu Ju’s boasting to his disciple, unable to surpass one another.

*Subcommentary:* Hui Shi’s words, each prizing his own rightness and striving to outdo others, are no different from Lu Ju’s—hence the question: *Is this not the same?*

Hui Shi said: Now the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists all engage me in debate, clashing with words and overpowering with voices, yet none has ever admitted my wrong—what do you make of this?

*Annotation:* "None has ever admitted my wrong" means each deems himself right. Hui Shi thus takes this as the ultimate achievement.

Zhuangzi said: There was a man of Qi who abandoned his child in Song, instructing the gatekeeper not to keep him whole—

*Annotation:* Casting him into a foreign land and entrusting him to a gatekeeper, he ensured the child would not leave unscathed.

*Subcommentary:* *Hūn* means "gatekeeper." The man of Qi discarded his child in Song and gave such an order—was this not his own rightness? When he sought his bronze bell, he bound it tightly—

*Annotation:* He reversed course, deeming the protection of the bell right, binding it for fear of damage.

When he sought his lost child, he never left the city—he left his kind behind.

*Annotation:* *Táng* means "lost." Having lost his child yet unable to search far, he abandoned his own kin, yet never deemed himself wrong. Human self-righteousness reaches such absurdity.

*Subcommentary:* *Xíng* is a small bell. *Táng* means "lost." Seeking a lost child yet never leaving the city; binding a bronze bell for fear of damage; valuing objects over children as unfilial—abandoning his kin yet still claiming rightness. There was a man of Chu who, while lodging, entrusted his child to a gatekeeper—

*Annotation:* Both were lodgers, unable to place themselves on high ground.

In the dead of night, when no one was about, he fought with the boatman, never leaving the bank yet already inciting resentment.

*Annotation:* *Cén* means "bank." Boarding another’s boat in the middle of the night, he had not yet left the shore before quarreling with its owner. The actions of these men of Qi and Chu were thus, yet they never deemed themselves wrong. How do the five masters’ self-righteousness differ from this?

*Subcommentary:* A man of Ying in Chu, while lodging as a guest near the riverbank, entrusted his child to a gatekeeper’s household. In the dead of night, when no one was about, he boarded another’s boat, and before the vessel had left the bank, he was already fighting with the boatman, forgetting kindness and instead breeding resentment—foolish and crude as this was, he still claimed rightness. Hui Shi and his followers are of this kind. *Cén* means "bank."

Zhuangzi, while attending a funeral, passed by Hui Shi’s grave. Turning to his followers, he said: A man of Ying daubed his nose with a fly’s-wing-thin layer of white clay, and had Carpenter Shi carve it away. Carpenter Shi swung his axe like the wind, listening as he struck—

*Annotation:* Eyes closed, hand unrestrained.

*Subcommentary:* Ying was the capital of Chu. The *Book of Han*’s "Biography of Yang Xiong" writes it as *Yǐng*, following this. The man of Ying was a plasterer. *È* is fine white clay; *màn* means "to smear." Zhuangzi, attending the burial of a close acquaintance, passed by Hui Shi’s grave and, reminiscing about the past, offered this analogy. With eyes closed and hand unrestrained, he struck by sound alone, and the axe’s mastery produced a wind-like rush. "Like a fly’s wing" describes its marvel. The clay was removed without harm to the nose, and the man of Ying stood unflinching.

When the Lord of Song Yuan heard of this, he summoned Carpenter Shi and said: Try it for me. Carpenter Shi replied: Your servant once could do it.

Though this I once could do, my material is long dead. Since the Master’s passing, I have had no material to work upon, no one with whom to speak.

The unflinching material and the partner who forgets words—without these, even the most wondrous stroke finds no use.

Carpenter Shi’s skill required an unmoving material; Zhuangzi’s wisdom still needed a partner who forgot words. When Huizi died, Zhuangzi lost his counterpart, and so the carpenter ceased his wind-like mastery, just as Zhuangzi stilled his subtle words by the Hao River.

When Guan Zhong fell ill, Duke Huan asked him: “Your illness has grown grave. If it should reach its final stage, to whom may I entrust the state?” Guan Zhong replied: “Whom does the Duke wish to appoint?” The Duke said: “Bao Shuya.” Guan Zhong said: “He will not do. He is a man of rigid integrity and noble character, but he does not associate with those beneath him, and once he hears of another’s fault, he remembers it for life. If he governs the state, he will offend the ruler above and alienate the people below. It will not be long before he incurs the Duke’s displeasure.” The Duke asked: “Then who is suitable?” Guan Zhong replied: “If there is no alternative, then Xi Peng will do. He is a man who forgets his rank above and disregards distinctions below. He feels shame before those who surpass the Yellow Emperor and pities those who fall short of himself. To distribute virtue is sagely; to distribute wealth is worthy. To rule with worthiness invites resistance; to yield with worthiness wins allegiance. In governing the state, he remains unaware of trifles; in managing his household, he overlooks faults. If there is no alternative, then Xi Peng will do.”

The King of Wu was sailing on the river when he ascended the Mountain of Monkeys. The troop of monkeys, seeing him, fled in terror and hid in the dense thickets. One monkey, however, lingered with leisurely bounds and daring leaps, displaying its skill before the king. The king shot at it, loosing arrows with swift precision, but the monkey caught them mid-flight. The king then ordered his attendants to shoot together, and the monkey perished clinging to a tree. The king turned to his friend Yan Buyi and said: “This monkey trusted in its cunning and relied on its agility to defy me, and so met its end. Take heed! Do not let your bearing make others proud.”

The monkey prided itself on its strength and skill, relied on its agility, and behaved arrogantly toward the king—thus it met its death. Alas, this cunning beast may serve as a warning to men: do not indulge in sensual pleasures or act with haughty pride in the world.

Yan Buyi returned home and studied under Dong Wu to uproot his vanity, renouncing music and shunning fame. After three years, the people of the state praised him.
*(Note: The character #30 is assumed to be "其" based on context.)*

South Count Zi Jing sat leaning on his armrest, gazing upward and sighing. Yan Chengzi entered and said: “Master, you are the most extraordinary of beings. Can the body truly be made like withered bones, the heart like dead ashes?”

Zi Jing replied: “Once I dwelled at the mouth of a mountain cave. At that time, when Lord Tian He caught sight of me, the people of Qi thrice celebrated it.
*(Note: The character #31 is assumed to be "之" based on context.)*

I must have preceded them, so they came to know me; I must have offered myself, so they came to treasure me.”

The commentary states: My reputation preceded me, thus allowing others to know me; I essentially sold myself to fame, so Tian He saw and emulated me. Had I not possessed it, how could they have known me? Had I not sold it, how could they have prized it?

The commentary further explains: If I had concealed my light and hidden my traces, possessing no reputation, how could the people of the world have known me? Had my name and worth not been esteemed, how could they have seen and emulated me? It is only because I could not erase my traces or conceal my beginnings that I became something constantly prized by others. Alas!

I grieve for those who lose themselves—
*(Commentary: "Lose" here means to forfeit or abandon.)*
Zi Qi laments the people of the world who discard their own Way to admire others.

Yet I also grieve for those who grieve for others—
*(Commentary: The Way admits no gain or loss, while beings are subject to sorrow and joy; thus, grieving for those who lose themselves is also lamentable.)*

And I further grieve for those who grieve for the grief of others—ever more distant with each passing day.
*(Commentary: Zi Qi knew that such grief could not save others but only harm oneself, so he chose not to grieve over grief. Thus, his sorrow gradually faded, leaving him serene and empty-minded, his form withered—hence the distance grows with time.)*
*(Commentary: The profound Way is empty and tranquil, without loss or joy. Therefore, grieving for those who lose themselves, as well as grieving for such grief—though varying in depth—all remain far from the Way and are thus lamentable. Grieving and grieving again, relinquishing and relinquishing once more, the teaching becomes manifest, and the mystery of mysteries is revealed, aligning with the myriad wonders. Hence, it is said to grow ever more distant.)*

When Confucius journeyed to Chu, the King of Chu offered him a feast. Sun Shu’ao held the goblet and stood, while Shi Nanyilaio received the wine and poured a libation, saying: “People of old—here, they would speak.”
*(Commentary: The ancients spoke only at gatherings.)*
*(Commentary: *Shang* refers to all wine vessels; here, it means the king feasted him with wine. A *jue* is also a wine vessel, holding one *sheng*. The ancients, before drinking, would first pour a libation. Shi Nanyilaio poured wine in offering and thus invoked the sage, wishing to discuss matters with Confucius at this moment.)*

Confucius said: “I have heard of speech without words—yet I have never spoken it.
*(Commentary: The sage speaks no words; what he utters are merely the words of the common people, hence ‘speech without words.’ If one takes speech as non-speech, then even when words leave the mouth, it is as if they have never been spoken.)*

Here, I shall speak it.”
*(Commentary: Now, I shall speak of the unspeakable at this moment.)*
*(Commentary: Principle as teaching is wordless; teaching as principle has never been spoken. Thus, the sage subtly embodies this truth, and in the end, it is said: ‘speaking yet never having spoken.’ Confucius, responding to Shi Nanyilaio’s request, thus spoke of the unspeakable at this moment.)*

Shi Nanyilaio juggled his balls to resolve the conflict between two families, while Sun Shu’ao slept peacefully, holding a feather fan, and the people of Ying laid down their weapons.
*(Commentary: These two masters settled disputes through silence, remaining tranquil and unperturbed, and the military strife dissolved of its own accord.)*
*(Commentary: His surname was Xiong, his given name Yiliao, a worthy and brave man of Chu, known for his silence. Dwelling south of the market, he was called Master of the South Market. When Bai Gong Sheng plotted rebellion and sought to kill the prime minister, Zi Xi, Sima Zi Qi said: ‘Xiong Yiliao is a brave warrior; if we obtain him, he could oppose five hundred men.’ Thus, they sent an envoy to summon him. Yiliao was juggling balls up and down in play, not speaking to the envoy. The envoy then brandished a sword at him, yet Yiliao showed no fear. Though he did not comply with the command, he also said nothing else. Without Yiliao, Bai Gong’s plans failed, hence ‘resolving the conflict between two families.’ His surname was Sun, his given name Shu’ao, prime minister of Chu, renowned for his virtuous counsel. Ying was the capital of Chu. *Tou* means to cease. Shu’ao, deeply learned and profoundly wise, slept peacefully and roamed freely, embodying principle without words, holding a feather fan in contentment. Thus, enemy states did not invade, and he repelled threats a thousand *li* away. The people of Chu lived in peace, cultivating civil virtue and setting aside military strategies. These two masters’ achievements are thus extolled, showing they were worthy to converse with Confucius and praise the profound Way.)*

“I wish I had a beak three feet long.”
*(Commentary: If one’s words are not one’s own, then even a lifetime of speech is as if never spoken. Thus, a beak three feet long is not long enough; for ordinary people, closing the mouth is not the same as not speaking.)*
*(Commentary: *Hui* means mouth. If one’s words are fitting, then this is no different from silence. Even if my beak were three feet long, how would it differ from a closed mouth? Hence, I wish for one.)*

That is called the Way of the un-Way.
*(Commentary: That refers to the two masters.)*
*(Commentary: That refers to the principle expounded. The un-Way as Way means it is neither the Way nor not the Way.)*

This is called the eloquence of the unspoken.
*(Commentary: This refers to Confucius.)*
*(Commentary: This refers to the teaching expounded. Speaking without speaking means it is neither speech nor not speech. Zi Xuan comments: ‘This refers to Confucius’—this annotation is crude and misses the mark. The un-Way and unspoken delve into the subtle and hidden, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature—how could the two masters have attained this? If one praises their peaceful sleep and ball-juggling as settling disputes through silence, then silence and speech are worlds apart—why would Confucius wish for a beak three feet long? Thus, it cannot be so. Moreover, this chapter profoundly discusses the ultimate mystery; judging by its flow, it has little to do with Sun and Xiong’s clarity.)*

Virtue encompasses all that the Way unifies.
*(Commentary: Though the Way’s manifestations are boundless, its great return lies solely in self-attainment—hence, it is one.)*

And words rest where knowledge cannot reach—this is perfection.

*(Annotation: Words that exceed their proper measure fall short of perfection.)*

*(Exegesis: The celestial realm of the ultimate Dao, the domain of profound mystery—even the sagely mind cannot fathom it, nor can the divine tongue articulate it. To seek truth through words and knowledge is to stray far indeed. Thus, what virtue unifies and words affirm lies solely in the singular mystery of the Dao. That which the Dao unifies, virtue cannot equal.)*

*(Annotation: Each attains it for themselves; they do not share it, yet the Dao remains one.)*

*(Exegesis: The singular Dao is empty and profound, boundless in its expanse, while virtue, though graded, cannot fully encompass it. Some texts read "同" as "equal," meaning virtue, though varying in excellence, cannot equal the Dao. This clarifies the earlier phrase, "that which the Dao unifies." What knowledge cannot know, discourse cannot exhaust.)*

*(Annotation: It lies not beyond its bounds, hence cannot be exhausted.)*

*(Exegesis: Knowledge pertains to the subtle Dao—what transcends names and words—thus, no argument or explanation can fully grasp it. This elucidates the earlier "what knowledge cannot know." To claim the names of Confucians and Mohists while acting thus is disastrous.)*

*(Annotation: Confucians and Mohists seek to equal what cannot be equaled, to exhaust what cannot be exhausted—hence, disaster.)*

*(Exegesis: Those who cling to right and wrong, adopting the names of Confucians and Mohists, invite calamity. Thus, the sea does not refuse the eastward flow—this is the height of greatness.)*

*(Annotation: Its greatness lies in accepting all without refusal.)*

*(Exegesis: A hundred rivers rush ceaselessly eastward, yet the vast sea receives them without hesitation. This speaks of the Eastern Sea, yet its vastness is supreme. The sage embraces heaven and earth, bestowing blessings upon all under heaven, yet none know his name.)*

*(Annotation: All is entrusted to spontaneity.)*

*(Exegesis: The earlier analogy of the sea is now matched. The sage’s virtue harmonizes with the two poles, thus embracing heaven and earth; his benevolence extends without limit, thus blessing all under heaven; he achieves yet does not dwell, thus none know who he is; he ascribes merit to others, thus none recognize his lineage. Therefore, in life he bears no rank.)*

*(Annotation: Possessing yet not possessing.)*

*(In death he receives no posthumous title.)*

*(Annotation: Posthumous titles honor merit, but merit does not reside in the self—thus, though titled, it is not his own.)*

*(Exegesis: In life, one holds rank and title; in death, a posthumous name is fixed to reflect their deeds. The sage, however, ascribes merit to others in life, so in death, no title befits him. In truth, he accumulates nothing.)*

*(Annotation: He lets all things be content.)*

*(Exegesis: Though possessing wealth and virtue, he disperses it all among others. His name is not established.)*

*(Annotation: Merit is not his own, so the name returns to things.)*

*(Exegesis: Names reflect reality; if reality is not accumulated, where can the name reside? This is called the Great Person.)*

*(Annotation: To act and claim possession is petty.)*

*(Exegesis: Summarizing the foregoing: one who forgets names and titles may be called a person of great virtue. A dog is not good because it barks well; a person is not worthy because they speak well.)*

*(Annotation: Worthiness arises from nature, not from words.)*

*(Exegesis: "Good" here means "fond of." A dog need not bark, nor a worthy person speak excessively—how much less so for the great. To be great is not enough to be called great, much less to be virtuous.)*

*(Annotation: Only spontaneity is virtue.)*

*(Exegesis: A compassionate heart is called great; harmony with the profound Dao is called virtue. To seek greatness with intent is already contrary to principle—how much more so to act with emotion for virtue. Greatness is complete, yet nothing surpasses heaven and earth. What do they seek to be so perfectly complete?)*

*(Annotation: Heaven and earth are complete in greatness, not through seeking.)*

*(Exegesis: "Complete" means fully endowed. The two poles cover and sustain, nurturing without intent; the four seasons proceed in order, generating and completing the myriad things. What method do they employ to ensure all is complete? One who knows completeness seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing, and does not let things alter the self.)*

*(Annotation: One who knows their own completeness does not grasp at things, hence seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing.)*

*(Exegesis: One who embodies the principle of natural vastness and finds all things inherently complete can remain indifferent between self and others, thus neither taking nor grasping, neither losing nor forfeiting, neither verifying nor attaining, and does not let external things seize the heart. Returning to the self without exhaustion.)*

*(Annotation: Returning to guard one’s own principle, one’s principle naturally flows.)*

*(Exegesis: Only through vast completeness can one align with the ultimate principle. Thus, returning to the root and reverting to the origin, one meets the subtlety of their own being without end. Following the ancient without friction.)*

*(Annotation: Following one’s constant nature to its natural end is not a matter of polishing.)*

*(Exegesis: "Following" means compliance. Complying with the nature of things without intentional alteration—why would one polish or adorn it? This is the sincerity of the Great Person.)*

*(Annotation: Not acting yet attaining—this is called sincerity.)*

*(Exegesis: "Sincerity" means reality. Returning to the root and reverting to the origin, following the myriad things—this is the true virtue of the great sage. Ziqí had eight sons; he arrayed them before him and summoned Jiufang Yin, saying: "Examine my sons for me—who is most auspicious?")*

*(Exegesis: Ziqí was the Minister of War of Chu. "Arrayed" means arranged in order. "诸" means "於" (before). Jiufang is the surname; Yin is the given name. "孰" means "who." "Auspicious" means good. Jiufang Yin was skilled in physiognomy. He arranged the sons before the courtyard and commanded Yin to examine them, asking which of the eight was most fortunate.)*

Jiufang Yin said, "Kun is the most auspicious."
*(Exegesis: Kun was the name of one son. Among the eight sons, Kun was the most virtuous and good.)*

Ziqí started in joy and asked, "How so?"
*(Exegesis: *Quran* denotes a look of surprise and delight. Hearing his son was auspicious, his expression showed astonishment and joy, and he asked what his auspicious appearance was like.)*

Jiufang Yin replied, "Kun will share the ruler’s table for the rest of his life."

Ziqí’s face fell as tears welled up, and he said, "Why must my son come to such an extreme?"
*(Exegesis: *Suoran* describes tears flowing. Jiufang Yin’s insight was shallow, taking meat-eating as auspicious, while Ziqí’s discernment was profound and subtle, knowing it was not truly fortunate. Thus, he pitied the extremity of misfortune and wept in sorrow.)*

Jiufang Yin said, "To share the ruler’s table brings favor to three clans—how much more to parents! Now that you weep upon hearing this, you reject good fortune. The son is auspicious, but the father is not."
*(Exegesis: The three clans refer to the father’s clan, the mother’s clan, and the wife’s clan. *Yu* means to resist. To share the ruler’s table is honor, wealth, and nobility, with blessings extending to the three clans—how could it be limited to parents alone? The son enjoys good fortune, yet the father weeps in response—this is rejecting virtue. Ziqí said, "Yin, how could you understand this and call Kun auspicious? It is merely about wine and meat entering the mouth and nose—how could you know their origin? I have never herded sheep, yet a ewe is born in the southwest corner; I have never hunted, yet a quail appears in the southeast. If this is not strange, what is?" *(Annotation: What is strange arises from the unexpected.)* *(Exegesis: *Zang* means sheep. The southwest corner is the *wei* position, the place of sheep; the southeast corner is the *chen* position, the place of quail—hence the mention of a ewe being born. Sheep require herding, and quail are obtained through hunting. If wealth and nobility depend on merit, how could Kun, whose deeds are unknown, share the ruler’s table? This is no different from having a sheep without herding or obtaining a quail without hunting. Without herding or hunting, how could it not be strange? What I share with my companions is wandering in the realm of Heaven and Earth. *(Annotation: Without purpose.)* I wander with them in joy beneath Heaven; I wander with them in sustenance upon Earth. *(Annotation: Following whatever is encountered in Heaven and Earth.)* *Yao* means to encounter. *(Exegesis: *Yao* means encounter. Heaven and Earth are without intent. Ziqí embodied the Dao, emptying himself and following things, content within his nature. He roamed between Heaven and Earth, finding fulfillment in whatever he encountered, needing no pleasure, and whatever he passed through became sustenance—how could it depend on rich flavors? I do not engage with them in affairs, nor in schemes, nor in strangeness. *(Annotation: *Guai* means anomaly. Following nature and acting spontaneously, free and unconstrained.)* *(Exegesis: Forgetting things, he does not engage in affairs; forgetting wisdom, he does not scheme; following the constant, he does not regard anything as strange. I ride the sincerity of Heaven and Earth without clashing with things. *(Annotation: This is not acting.)* *(Exegesis: *Cheng* means reality. Riding the true Way of the Two Modes, he follows the myriad things in carefree wandering, never clashing or disturbing them. I go along with them in ease without letting affairs dictate what is fitting. *(Annotation: This is following without discrimination.)* *(Exegesis: *Wei yi* means to go along freely. With no division between mind and environment, he moves with things in harmony. If affairs are not truly affairs, how could they dictate what is fitting? Now, there is a worldly recompense. *(Annotation: One who acts for things is repaid by them. I do not act for merit, yet I am repaid—why?)* *(Exegesis: Rewarding merit and virtue is the way of the world. If one embodies the Dao and follows things without seeking merit or fame, why would one need recompense? Whenever there are strange omens, there must be strange conduct. Alas, this is not the fault of my son or me—it is Heaven’s doing. *(Annotation: Now, with no strange conduct yet strange omens, it must be fate.)* *(Exegesis: *Dai* means peril; *ji* means near. Strange conduct must bring strange omens. Now, my son has no strange conduct yet faces strange omens—this peril must be Heaven-sent calamity, not his fault. That is why I weep. *(Annotation: What happens due to action can be avoided by not acting. What comes without action cannot be helped—hence the tears.)* *(Exegesis: If the fault were his, he might amend it. Since it is Heaven’s decree, he weeps.)* Before long, Kun was sent as an envoy to Yan. Bandits seized him on the road. Selling him whole would be difficult, but cutting off his foot would make it easier. *(Annotation: Keeping him whole risked escape, so maiming him made sale easier.)* *(Exegesis: *Wu ji he* means a brief moment. The state of Chu sent Kun as an envoy to Yan, but on the road, he was captured by bandits and enslaved. Selling him whole risked escape, making it hard to guard him, but cutting off his foot removed that concern, making sale easier.)* Thus, they cut off his foot and sold him in Qi, where he happened to serve as a street warden for Qu Gong and ended his life eating meat. *(Exegesis: Qu Gong was a wealthy man in Qi who served as a street warden. After Kun’s foot was cut off, he was sold to a wealthy merchant in Qi, where he oversaw the street and ate meat for the rest of his life.)*

The character *qu* (渠) is also written as *tu* (术), which states: Qu Gong was a butcher. Kun was sold to a butcher’s household, where he jointly oversaw the craft of slaughter, and thus ate meat for the rest of his life.

Nie Que encountered Xu You and asked, “Where are you going?”
*(Annotation: Nie Que met Xu You and inquired where he intended to go.)*
Xu You replied, “I am fleeing from Yao.”
*(Annotation: He answered that he sought to escape Emperor Yao.)*
Nie Que asked, “What do you mean?”
*(Annotation: He questioned the reason.)*
Xu You said, “Yao is so excessively benevolent that I fear he will become a laughingstock to the world. In later generations, men may even devour one another.”
*(Annotation: The root of contention lies in benevolence.)*
*(Annotation: *Xuxu* (畜畜) describes the flourishing of such conduct. The practice of partial, biased benevolence deviates from the virtue of pure harmony. I fear that those within the realm who have lost the Dao will grow even more dissolute than the degenerate ages of old. As they follow in Yao’s footsteps, the people will suffer famine, granaries will empty, and the people will inevitably turn to cannibalism. Thus, I flee.)*

“The people are not difficult to gather: cherish them, and they draw near; benefit them, and they come; praise them, and they are encouraged; impose what they detest, and they scatter.”
*(Annotation: The people grow close when cherished, come when benefited, are encouraged by praise, and disperse when confronted with what they loathe. Thus, the assembly and dispersal of the common folk are not difficult.)*

“Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness. Few abandon benevolence and righteousness, while many exploit them. The practice of benevolence and righteousness is inherently insincere.”
*(Annotation: Once benevolence and righteousness are practiced, pretense follows.)*
*(Annotation: To benefit all beings, nurture all creatures, and gather the masses through merit—nothing precedes benevolence and righteousness. Yet those who truly embody benevolence and righteousness from within are few, while many feign saintly traces to pursue fame and profit. Thus, those who practice benevolence and righteousness do so with artificial nature and false sentiment, lacking sincerity.)*

“Moreover, they become tools for the greedy and rapacious.”
*(Annotation: When benevolence and righteousness are visible, the poor will borrow these tools to achieve their aims.)*
*(Annotation: *Qi* (器) refers to saintly traces. Those who are avaricious for fame and profit, more treacherous than birds and beasts, must borrow benevolence and righteousness as their instruments.)*

“Thus, the judgments of one man bring profit to the world.”
*(Annotation: If benevolence and righteousness arose from genuine sentiment, their judgments would not be confined to one man.)*
*(Annotation: Those who covet glory and profit, wielding benevolence and righteousness, impose their judgments upon the world. Without the traces of sages, how could this be so?)*

“It is like a single blade: if the myriad things, in their myriad forms, are cut by one measure, harm will follow.”
*(Annotation: *Mi* (覕) means to cut. If the myriad things, in their myriad forms, are severed by a single blade, injury will result.)*
*(Annotation: *Mi* means to cut. If one man’s rule subdues the world, it is like a single knife cutting the myriad things—harm will be widespread.)*

“Yao knew that the worthy benefit the world but did not realize they also harm it. Only those who stand beyond worthiness understand this.”
*(Annotation: To stand beyond worthiness is to prevent its pretense.)*
*(Annotation: The traces of sages may benefit one age, but in ten thousand generations, they will surely spawn harm. Only those who forget and transcend the worthy and the sage grasp this subtlety.)*

There are those who are *nuan shu* (暖姝), those who are *ru xu* (濡需), and those who are *juan lou* (卷娄).
*(Annotation: These are briefly outlined below for explanation.)*

The *nuan shu* are those who study the words of a single master, delighting privately in their *nuan nuan shu shu* self-satisfaction, believing they have attained sufficiency. Yet they do not know that nothing has truly been grasped.
*(Annotation: When intent is exhausted in form and teaching, how could they know of my solitary transformation in the profound and obscure realm?)*
*(Annotation: *Nuan shu* describes self-satisfaction. Those of limited learning, content with their meager knowledge, believe they have plumbed the subtlest mysteries. Yet what they have learned amounts to nothing—this is what is meant by *nuan shu*, summarizing the preceding point.)*

Thus, they are called *nuan shu*.

The *ru xu* are like lice on a pig: they select sparse bristles, believing them to be vast palaces and grand parks. They take the curves of hooves and the spaces between teats and thighs as secure chambers and advantageous dwellings, unaware that one morning, the butcher will roll up his sleeves, spread straw, and wield fire and smoke—whereupon they and the pig will burn together.
*(Annotation: *Ru xu* describes arrogance. The pig is the host. The lice, dwelling on the pig’s body, choose sparse, long bristles to fashion into vast palaces and gardens. The gaps between hooves and the spaces beside teats and thighs become warm and convenient abodes. Yet how would they know the butcher will suddenly seize fire and smoke, roll up his sleeves, spread straw, and slaughter them—so that they and the pig burn together?)*

Those who indulge in sensual desires among the ignorant masses differ not from the lice on the pig, reveling in their *ru xu* arrogance. Here they advance with their domain, there they retreat with their domain. *(Annotation: "Domain" refers to boundaries or realms.)* The lice perish when the pig dies; men rise and fall with their circumstances, hence the term "advancing and retreating with their domain." Such are the so-called *ru xu*.

*(Commentary:)* Those lacking the talent to adapt to change or transcend the world, yet clinging to fleeting comforts, are no different from the lice on the pig.

*(Annotation:)* The "hunched one" is Shun. Mutton does not seek ants, but ants seek mutton—for mutton is rank. Shun possessed a rank virtue, and the people delighted in him. *(Annotation: "Hunched one" describes a stooped posture, shoulders bowed and back curved in humility. Mutton, being rank, does not seek ants, yet ants flock to it. Shun’s virtuous conduct did not seek the people, yet the people rejoiced in him. Thus, mutton is likened to Shun, and ants to the people.)* Hence, thrice he fled to establish new settlements, and at Deng’s ruins, a hundred thousand households gathered. *(Annotation: To evade his son Dan Zhu and avoid the crowds, Shun fled thrice, yet the people, drawn by his virtue, followed in numbers reaching a hundred thousand, forming cities wherever he dwelled. Dengxu is a place name.)* Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from barren land, hoping to receive his beneficent influence. *(Annotation: "Barren land" refers to soil devoid of vegetation. Yao, recognizing Shun’s sagely virtue, wed him to his daughters E Huang and Nü Ying, and elevated him to succeed his throne, yielding the realm to him. Though dwelling in desolate lands and enduring hardships, he awaited the neighboring states to emulate his example, that the common people might receive his grace.)* Yet when Shun was raised from that barren land, his years had grown long, his senses had dimmed, and he could not retire—such was the "hunched one."

*(Commentary:)* The sage’s form differs not from that of ordinary men, thus his ears and eyes may weaken, yet his spirit remains whole from beginning to end. If sageliness were absent in youth, and declined with age, would the sage’s sagacity not vanish in a single morning?

*(Annotation:)* Having ascended the throne as the Son of Heaven, his power spanning the realm, he pitied the common people and grieved for the masses. Thus, in his advanced age, his senses waned, and he found no respite, unable to return home. Hunched and weary, body and spirit exhausted—such was the "hunched one."

Therefore, the divine man detests the multitude’s arrival, *(Commentary: The multitude comes of its own accord, not because he seeks them.)* *(Annotation: Thrice he fled to escape them, for he loathed their presence.)* for where crowds gather, there is no harmony, and where there is no harmony, there is no benefit. *(Commentary: It is clear that Shun’s acquisition of the realm was a matter of necessity, not of seeking advantage through alliances.)* *(Annotation: "Harmony" here means accord. Where crowds assemble, discord arises, and discord brings no benefit.)* Thus, he held nothing too dear, nothing too distant, embracing virtue and warming harmony to align with the world—this is the true man.

*(Annotation: "Warming" means to nurture. The unfathomable divine man regards all with impartiality, upholding harmony—such is the true sage.)* To ants, he abandoned cunning; to fish, he acted wisely; to sheep, he forsook intent. *(Commentary: To the people, he bestowed grace; to Shun, he brought toil.)* *(Annotation: He did not emulate mutton’s virtue, hence to ants he abandoned cunning; he did not teach through rank conduct, hence to sheep he forsook intent. Having forsaken benevolence and righteousness, he aligned with the supreme Dao, neither clinging nor drowning, forgetting all in the rivers and lakes—thus to fish he acted wisely. This critiques Shun’s rank virtue, hence these words.)*

With the eye, he saw the eye; with the ear, he heard the ear; with the heart, he returned to the heart. *(Commentary: These three—eye, ear, and heart—remain present, yet without their usual functions.)* *(Annotation: Seeing only what the eye perceives, hearing only what the ear hears, knowing only what the heart knows, not pursuing what lies beyond one’s bounds but abiding within them—such is the way of the true man.)* In this state, his equilibrium was as a plumb line, *(Commentary: He had not yet transcended the plumb line to achieve self-equilibrium.)* *(Annotation: The plumb line is mindless yet straightens all things; the sage is detached yet impartial.)* and his transformations followed the natural order. *(Commentary: He had not yet erased his traces to achieve profound unity.)* *(Annotation: "Followed" means to comply. Dwelling in the world, he harmonized his light, adapting to myriad changes, greatly complying with the people, never opposing the few.)*

The true men of old treated all with the Dao of Heaven, *(Commentary: Abiding in non-action to await action, action thus succeeds.)* *(Annotation: The above explanation describes the ancient true man, who employed the natural Dao, emptying his heart to await all things.)* not imposing human affairs upon Heaven. *(Commentary: Seeking non-action through action only deepens chaos.)* *(Annotation: He did not employ human affairs to disrupt Heaven’s wisdom.)*

The true men of old gained life through it, lost it through death; gained death through it, lost it through life. *(Commentary: Life and death, gain and loss, each follows its circumstances. In life, it may be gain; in death, it may be loss—nothing is constant.)* *(Annotation: From the perspective of life, life is gain; from the perspective of death, life is loss. Since life and death are uncertain, to whom do gain and loss truly belong? Alas, it cannot be known. Thus, he merged life and death, unified gain and loss—hence he is called the true man.)*

Medicines—some are aconite, some platycodon, some chicken droppings, some pig’s droppings—at their proper time, they become sovereign remedies. What more need be said? *(Commentary: When needed, even the lowly is invaluable; out of season, even the noble is worthless. Value and worthlessness depend on timing—who can claim constancy?)* *(Annotation: Aconite treats wind impediment.)*

Knotweed root treats heart and abdominal blood disorders. "Chicken droppings" refers to *Glechoma longituba*, which when ingested prolongs life. "Pig’s droppings" is the root of *Polyporus umbellatus*, resembling pig feces, and treats wasting-thirst. These are all humble medicines. "Sovereign" means ruler. Medicines know no nobility or baseness—what cures is good; when medicine and illness match, it becomes the ruler. Even sight, hearing, grasping, and knowing—all have their times of use and concealment, their seasons of flourishing and decline. Thus, what the times deem worthy becomes sovereign; talent unsuited to the age becomes a subject. This is the inevitable way of things—how could it ever be fully spoken?

King Goujian, with three thousand men in armor, took refuge on Mount Kuaiji. *(Annotation: Goujian was the king of Yue. Kuaiji is a mountain name. Yue, devastated by Wu’s armies, retreated in distress and took refuge on Mount Kuaiji.)* Only Minister Zhong knew how to preserve a state on the brink of ruin, yet only he failed to foresee the sorrow that would befall himself. *(Annotation: Zhong was a grandee of Yue. At the time, Goujian suffered a crushing defeat, left with only three thousand soldiers, and fled to Mount Kuaiji—annihilation seemed imminent. Yet Zhong, with his deep schemes and foresight, discerned how ruin could be averted. He then feigned submission to Wu, and after twenty-two years, Yue destroyed Wu. As the saying goes: "When the cunning hare dies, the good hound is stewed; when the enemy state falls, the loyal minister perishes." Such is the way of things. After the conquest of Wu, Fan Li left Yue and wandered the rivers and seas, changing his name and concealing his brilliance—this was the later Tao Zhu Gong. Minister Zhong did not leave, and was executed by Goujian. He knew how a ruined state could be saved, but not how his own sorrow—death—was inevitable. The character *zhong* may also be written as 種, to be read accordingly.)*

Thus it is said: The crow’s eye has its proper use; the crane’s step has its measure—when parted, there is sorrow. *(Annotation: Each serves its time and purpose, yet none can be all things at all times. Thus, there are times of loss, and times of sorrow. *Jie* means to depart.)* *(Annotation: The owl’s eye is dim by day but sharp by night—it suits the night but not the day. The crane’s legs are long by nature—it can be long but not short. Such limitations bring sorrow when parted from their proper use, just as Zhong excelled at preserving the state but failed to secure his own fate.)*

Thus it is said: When the wind passes over the river, it diminishes it; when the sun passes over the river, it diminishes it. *(Annotation: All things with form naturally burden one another; only that which is beyond form cannot be worn away.)* *(Annotation: Wind and sun are *qi*; the river has form and substance. All things with form and *qi* cannot be without burden. When wind and sun act upon the river, there must be loss—yet relying on its source, the river does not perceive it. This is like Wu, after conquering Yue, executing its meritorious ministers who, trusting in their past achievements, failed to foresee their doom. Thus, things that benefit one another must also harm one another.)* It is said: The wind and sun merely guard the river, yet the river deems itself untouched. *(Annotation: It is already diminished, yet does not realize it. It relies on its source.)* *(Annotation: It does not perceive the loss because it relies on its source.)* *(Annotation: *Shi* means to rely; *ying* means to diminish. The wind and sun guard the river, diminishing it without its awareness, for it relies on its source.)*

Thus, water guards earth steadfastly; a shadow guards its person steadfastly; a thing guards its counterpart steadfastly. *(Annotation: Without intent, it abides by its nature—this is steadfastness.)* *(Annotation: *Shen* means stability. Water is not secure without earth; a shadow is not visible without a person; a thing does not exist without its creator. Thus, the three guard one another and deem themselves secure. Yet the old does not remain, existence and extinction do not cease. Yesterday’s thing is already transformed today. The hidden boat in the mountain—fools do not perceive this principle.)*

Thus, the eye’s clarity is perilous; the ear’s acuity is perilous; the heart’s pursuit is perilous. *(Annotation: Intent leads to boundlessness—hence peril.)* *(Annotation: *Xun* means to pursue. If the eye seeks the clarity of Li Zhu, the ear the acuity of Shi Kuang, and the heart the boundless knowledge of sages, can peril be avoided?)* All ability stored in the organs is perilous; once peril is formed, it cannot be remedied in time. *(Annotation: Thus, it is noble to be without ability and follow nature.)* *(Annotation: Those who wield discriminating wisdom from their organs and boast of their abilities will surely meet danger. Even if they succeed, they cannot turn back in time to repent.)*

Disaster’s growth gathers here. *(Annotation: *Cui* means to gather. If one cannot forget knowledge, disaster’s growth will be manifold.)* *(Annotation: *Zi* means abundance; *cui* means to gather. Those who serve their organs and display their abilities will see calamities and misfortunes multiply and accumulate.)* Its reversal follows from merit. *(Annotation: Returning to guard one’s nature, merit does not arise and thus is perfected.)* *(Annotation: Those who boast of their abilities and invite ruin do so because they do not retreat after success.)* Its fruition waits upon time. *(Annotation: Haste yields no fruition.)* *(Annotation: Sincere success is followed by self-praise. The heart that waits endures.)* To regard this as one’s treasure—is it not sorrowful? *(Annotation: "One’s treasure" refers to possessing knowledge and ability.)* *(Annotation: The deluded, clinging to their abilities, succeed and remain obstinate. How sorrowful!)*

Thus, the destruction of states and the slaughter of people never cease. *(Annotation: All are disasters of possessing a self.)*

The covetous, claiming lands as their great treasure, seize them by unrighteous means—states shattered, families ruined, countless common folk harmed without end. This is the failure to inquire.

*(Annotation: Not inquiring into the source of calamity stems from self-attachment; one must cultivate the heart to avert disaster.)*

*(Annotation: The world has its wise—these are its tortoise-shell mirrors. Not inquiring into the causes of ruin and misfortune, clinging only to hatred of poverty and lowliness, is the height of folly.)*

Thus, the foot treads upon the earth, and though it treads, it relies on what it does not tread to walk far.

*(Annotation: "Treads" and "tramples" both mean to step upon. The foot’s ability to walk depends on the earth it stands on, yet it must also rely on untrodden ground to proceed; without such space, it cannot move steadily or travel far. This is an analogy.)*

So too with human knowledge: though little, it depends on what it does not know to be called knowledge.

*(Annotation: Only by forgetting heaven and earth, relinquishing the myriad things, can one comprehend even the wing of a cicada—how much less can one know the Way of Heaven while still clinging to a self?)*

*(Annotation: Knowledge has its brightness and obscurity; ability has its limits. Each abiding in its measure, all things wander freely. Thus, the earth, though trodden, moves by what is untrodden; the heart, though knowing, illuminates by what it does not know. This is the principle of dwelling in stillness and nurturing tranquility. As the *Laozi* says: "Existence is for benefit; non-existence is for function." This aligns with the analogy.)*

To know the Great Unity, the Great Yin, the Great Eye, the Great Equality, the Great Square, the Great Faithfulness, the Great Constancy—this is perfection.

*(Annotation: Here, a brief outline of those who know the seven great principles, who may be said to have reached the ultimate. The following text explicates their meanings one by one.)*

The Great Unity unifies all.

*(Annotation: The Dao.)*

*(Annotation: One is the number of yang. The Great Unity is Heaven, which unites and generates the myriad things, hence "unifies.")*

The Great Yin dissolves all.

*(Annotation: Employing what lies within its bounds, the myriad affairs encounter no obstruction.)*

*(Annotation: The Great Yin is Earth, which, without intent, bears and sustains all things without division.)*

The Great Eye sees all.

*(Annotation: Letting the myriad things reveal themselves is itself the Great Eye.)*

*(Annotation: Each seeing what it sees is called the Great Eye.)*

The Great Equality follows all.

*(Annotation: Following the inherent nature of each, allowing all to attain their own, is the Great Equality.)*

*(Annotation: "Follows" means to accord. The Great Equality is the full sufficiency of each thing’s nature, all equally balanced.)*

The Great Square embodies all.

*(Annotation: Embodying so that each attains its proper place, all directions are thus encompassed—this is the Great Square.)*

*(Annotation: The forms of the myriad things each have their methods, like spiders weaving webs. To comprehend this is to embody the Great Square.)*

The Great Faithfulness fulfills all.

*(Annotation: What is ordained must be fulfilled without deviation—this is the Great Faithfulness.)*

*(Annotation: "Faithfulness" means reality; "fulfills" means to reach. Following and entrusting each to its own reality is the Great Faithfulness.)*

The Great Constancy upholds all.

*(Annotation: The true, unperturbed, is naturally constant; thus, upholding it with the Great Constancy is not to uphold at all.)*

*(Annotation: Each thing, empty in its essence, upheld and employed—its principle is emptiness.)*

All possess Heaven.

*(Annotation: No thing is without its natural endowment.)*

*(Annotation: None of the seven great principles above exist apart from the natural.)*

Following, there is illumination.

*(Annotation: Following brings clarity; no action is required.)*

*(Annotation: "Following" means to accord. Simply accord with the natural, and wisdom illuminates of itself.)*

In darkness, there is a pivot.

*(Annotation: The ultimate principle has its limit; when one darkly attains it, one grasps its essential pivot.)*

*(Annotation: The profound and obscure principle has its own pivot and mechanism, employed without deliberate effort.)*

In the beginning, there is the Other.

*(Annotation: What begins with the Other is the Other; thus, I transmit but do not create.)*

*(Annotation: What begins with the Other is the Other; thus, I transmit but do not create.)*

Thus, to dissolve it is to resemble one who does not dissolve.

*(Annotation: Dissolving by entrusting to the Other, the Other dissolves itself; dissolving without effort thus resembles not dissolving.)*

*(Annotation: The dissolution comes from following the Other’s teaching—beware of partial attainment becoming one’s nature, hence it does not resemble dissolution.)*

To know it is to resemble one who does not know.

*(Annotation: Illuminating the Other’s knowing.)*

*(Annotation: Able to forget one’s knowledge, thus resembling one who does not know.)*

Not knowing, and only then knowing it.

*(Annotation: If I do not know, the Other’s knowing acts of itself; when the Other’s knowing acts of itself, none under Heaven fail to know.)*

*(Annotation: Knowing by not knowing—thus, not knowing and only then knowing is true knowledge.)*

To inquire into it cannot be bounded,

*(Annotation: Responding to things appropriately, without fixed method.)*

Yet it cannot be unbounded.

*(Annotation: Each according to its measure.)*

Though tangled, there is reality.

*(Annotation: Though the myriad things are tangled and disparate, each thing has its own reality.)*

*(Annotation: "Tangled" means disparate. The myriad things, though chaotic and tangled, when governed as one, become the resource of the real Dao.)*

Ancient and modern do not replace one another.

*(Annotation: Each has its own cause and cannot substitute for the other.)*

The ancient abides in the ancient—it does not extend from ancient times to the present. The present persists in the present—it does not arise from the present to generate the ancient. Each thing has its own nature, and thus they do not replace one another.

Nor can they be diminished,
*(Annotation: Each should fully realize its own measure.)*

*(Annotation: Time does not come and go; the law does not shift or trade. How could the present rely on the ancient? Can this not be called a great upheaval and collapse?)*

*(Annotation: To collapse and then elevate—there is a great limit.)*

*(Annotation: As in the questions above, the Way is vast and boundless. How could it not be said to illuminate the subtle principle while collapsing concrete arguments?)*

Why not ask this very question? Why remain so perplexed?
*(Annotation: If one asks about this great collapse, then things have their ultimate measure. Thus, the principle of forgetting oneself and responding to things can be known—why remain so bewildered?)*

*(Annotation: Why—what? The ignorant, like wanderers in the night, why do they not inquire of the sage? Yet when they weaken and lose their way, becoming so confused and distressed—what is the reason for this?)*

To resolve confusion with the unconfused is to return to the unconfused—this is the ultimate unconfused state.
*(Annotation: Confusion cannot be resolved, so the ultimate unconfused state is the height of folly. Thus, the sage follows and responds to things, which is why the traces of emperors and kings differ, adapting their names to the age.)*

*(Annotation: The sage’s wisdom is unconfused, yet it is confused by worldly emotions. Using the words of sagely wisdom to clarify worldly confusion, forgetting attainment and returning to the root, reverting to the true source—yet one cannot grasp the meaning beyond words and clings to sagely traces, valuing and esteeming explicit teachings, taking the unconfused as the greatest. This is to aspire to the unconfused—how can it truly dispel confusion? This is yet another departure from the unconfused.)*

*Annotations by Guo Xiang of Henan*

**Commentary by Master Cheng Xuanying of the Tang, on the "Miscellaneous Chapters: Zeyang" (Chapter Twenty-Five) of the *Zhuangzi***

Zeyang traveled in Chu. **[Commentary]** His surname was Peng, his given name Yang, and his courtesy name Zeyang; he was a man of Lu. He served various feudal lords and later entered Chu, intending to serve King Wen of Chu. Yijie spoke of him to the king, but the king did not grant him an audience. **[Commentary]** His surname was Yi, his given name Jie; he was a minister of Chu. Zeyang wished to serve Chu, so he relied on Yijie to speak of him to the king. Since the king was noble and esteemed, he had not yet granted an audience. Yijie’s recommendation had not yet succeeded, so he left court and returned home.

Yijie departed. Pengyang saw Wang Guo and said, “Why do you not speak of me to the king?” **[Commentary]** Wang Guo was a worthy grandee of Chu. *Tan* means to praise or speak of; some texts also write it as *yantan* (discourse). Previously, relying on Yijie, he had not obtained an audience with the king; later, he entreated Wang Guo, hoping he would recommend him. Wang Guo said, “I am not equal to Gong Yuexiu.” **[Commentary]** *Ruo* means “like.” Gong Yuexiu was the sobriquet of a recluse. Wang Guo, a worthy man, disapproved of Pengyang’s haste and greed for glory, so he extolled the recluse to curb his eagerness for advancement.

Pengyang said, “What does Gong Yuexiu do?” **[Commentary]** *Xi* means “what.” Since he had praised Gong Yuexiu, Pengyang claimed not to know, so he asked what he did, hoping to learn the reason. [Wang Guo] said, “In winter, he spears turtles alone in the river; in summer, he rests in the mountain groves. If someone passes by and asks, he says, ‘This is my home.’” **[Annotation]** This is said to curb Pengyang’s eagerness for advancement. **[Commentary]** *Du* means to stab; *fan* means the side or a dense forest. In the depths of winter, he stabs turtles by the riverbank to roam freely; in the height of summer, he retreats to rest in the dense woods to find comfort. With no worldly attachments, he points to the mountainside and calls it his dwelling. This briefly describes Yuexiu’s conduct.

“If Yijie has already failed, how much more so I? I am even less capable than Yijie. Now, as for Yijie’s character: he lacks virtue but possesses cunning. He does not trust himself but uses his cleverness to mystify his connections, firmly entangling himself in the realm of wealth and honor.” **[Annotation]** This says that I am not as fond of wealth and honor as Yijie, who cultivates connections and exhausts his form and intent, relying on his knowledge to curry favor with superiors. **[Commentary]** *Leiming* means to be lost or submerged. It says that Yijie’s connections are steadfast, his intent fixed on glory; he is deluded and confused, his heart greedy for wealth and honor. He truly lacks true virtue but possesses worldly knowledge; he cannot follow the Dao with emptiness and tranquility but instead relies on his cunning to seek favor. Repeatedly acting thus, even he cannot succeed—how much less can I, who clings to foolishness, recommend him? This is Wang Guo’s modest speech.

“He does not aid others with virtue but instead harms them.” **[Annotation]** If he advances recklessly, his virtue is shallow, and his reputation is diminished. **[Commentary]** *Xiao* means to damage or ruin. It says that if Zeyang relies on me to speak of him to the king, this will only ruin his reputation and conduct, not benefit his great virtue.

“The frozen borrow clothes from spring; the scorched turn to winter’s cold wind.” **[Annotation]** This says that I follow the seasons’ gifts and cannot rush to Pengyang’s aid. **[Commentary]** Those who suffer from cold are warmed by clothing; those afflicted by heat are revived by water. They await the warmth of spring to thaw the frost or the cold wind of winter to relieve the heat. Though this departs from human affairs, it accords with the seasons. The man who treads the Way and understands principle embodies no immediate kindness; his refusal to advance Pengyang follows the same principle.

“As for the King of Chu’s character: his form is august and stern. In punishing offenses, he is as unforgiving as a tiger. If not for a flattering man of upright virtue, who could sway him?” **[Commentary]** His bearing commands the majesty of one who faces south; his dignity rests upon the power of a thousand chariots. His wrath is fierce, like a ravening tiger; in punishing and humiliating the people, he grants no pardon. If not for a great flatterer, none could serve him. How could a man who treads uprightness and embodies virtue bend his will to serve such a ruler?

Thus the sage—when impoverished—makes his household forget their poverty.
**[Annotation]** Serene and desireless, he finds joy in what befalls him, not prizing extravagance but honoring the Dao and virtue. Thus his family does not recognize poverty as suffering.
**[Commentary]** Yu-kou dwelt in Zheng, Lao Lai in Chu; though their wives drew the crossbow in straitened circumstances, their joy remained within. If worthy scholars can do this, how much more the true sage—such is his resolve in poverty.

When prosperous, he makes kings and dukes forget their ranks and emoluments, transforming them to humility.
**[Annotation]** Lightly regarding rank and emolument while esteeming the Dao and virtue, he sits in profound forgetfulness, unaware of the honor upon him. Thus he makes kings and dukes lose what they once held high.
**[Commentary]** Concealing brilliance is poverty; manifesting traces is prosperity. Duke Ai befriended Confucius; the Yellow Emperor crawled to Guangchengzi. In each case, where the Dao was present, reverence followed, unbound by rank. Thus they could make kings of ten thousand chariots and lords of the five orders transform their lofty hearts into humble conduct.

Toward things, he delights in harmony with them.
**[Annotation]** He does not suffer on their account.
**[Commentary]** Moving through the world, he engages with things impartially; all he encounters brings contentment, so he is never without joy.

Toward others, he rejoices in their free flow while preserving himself.
**[Annotation]** Others flow freely without losing himself.
**[Commentary]** Though he mingles in the world without obstruction, he does not lose himself in others. His movement does not disturb stillness, and he ever guards his true nature.

Thus, though he may not speak, he fills others with harmony.
**[Annotation]** Each attains self-realization—this is the harmony of drinking. What need is there for words?
**[Commentary]** Sheltering all beings, he merges obscurely with the vast heavens. The Dao of central harmony is realized in every heart; they depart with fullness, without need of verbal instruction.

Standing alongside others, he transforms them.
**[Annotation]** They gaze upon his influence and yield to it.
**[Commentary]** Blending light with the dust, he stands among them; each returns to their true nature—this is transformation.

The proper order of father and son—there they return to dwell.
**[Annotation]** He causes fathers to be fathers and sons to be sons, each returning to their place.
**[Commentary]** Though he mingles high and low, the natural order remains unharmed. Thus fathers and sons, rulers and ministers, each occupy their proper station, without confusion—is this not fitting?

Yet there is no gap in what he bestows.
**[Annotation]** His bestowal aligns with the virtue of heaven and earth, thus it is unceasing and unwavering.
**[Commentary]** All his acts of grace follow the sequence of the four seasons, ever unhurried and composed, his movement and stillness undivided.

So distant is he from the hearts of others.
**[Commentary]** The sage’s use of the heart, as described above, reveals his purity, loftiness, and profound remoteness.

Thus it is said: await Gongyue Xiu.
**[Annotation]** He wishes him to abandon the King of Chu and follow Xiu, that the wind of tranquility may still his restless heart.
**[Commentary]** This is the summation. The sage comprehends the intricate and entangled.
**[Annotation]** This is what is called "mysterious penetration."
**[Commentary]** The sage of the Dao, transcending all bonds, understands that the realm of things is illusory—how could he be fettered by the world’s net? Though Xiu has not yet fully attained the Dao, he is cited here as an example.

All things share one body.
**[Annotation]** Without inner or outer, all are equally illumined.
**[Commentary]** His wisdom encompasses all things, he exhausts principle and fulfills nature. Self and other are not two, thus all merge into one body.

Yet he does not know why it is so—it is his nature.
**[Annotation]** That which is naturally so without knowing why—what else could it be but nature?
**[Commentary]** Capacity and object respond, realm and wisdom merge; he does not know how it is so, nor can he distinguish the reason. Thus he accords with true nature.

Returning to the mandate, he moves and acts, taking heaven as his teacher.
**[Annotation]** He moves of himself, acts of himself, yet none fail to return to the mandate and take their natural state as teacher.
**[Commentary]** Returning to the root, he reverts to the original mandate. Though he moves and acts in accord with things, his movement and stillness are without intent, harmonizing with heaven and earth—thus he takes the two powers as his teacher.

Others then follow and name him.
**[Annotation]** This is not seeking fame by pursuing lofty traces. Moving in accord with nature, his traces are naturally lofty, so others cannot diminish his name.
**[Commentary]** *Ming* means "name." The sage who embodies the Dao has no name, but because his pure dust may be admired, others follow and name him.

Worrying through knowledge, his conduct lasts but a brief moment. When it must cease, what then?
**[Annotation]** Acting through knowledge brings a succession of worries.
**[Commentary]** Using knowledge to engage with things breeds cares and distractions; the spirit is easily swayed, conduct lasts but a moment. With clinging thoughts and anxieties, when will there be rest?

Even if it were Yu the Great, there would be no remedy.

One born beautiful—others provide him a mirror. If not told, he does not know his beauty surpasses others.
**[Annotation]** *Jian* means "mirror." A mirror reflects without partiality, thus people admire it. Now, does the mirror know it is mirroring when it mirrors? Born to reflect, others call it a mirror. If people did not tell one another, none would know its beauty surpasses others. This is like the sage—others give him a name.
**[Commentary]** *Jian* means "mirror." *Gao* means "to tell." Born bright and illuminating, it reflects things impartially; people admire it, thus it is called a mirror. If people did not tell one another, the mirror would have no name. This begins the analogy.

Whether he knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, his delight never ends.
**[Annotation]** The mirror’s delight lies in its lack of feeling. Whether one knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, it reflects upon approach—thus its delight never ends.

If the mirror’s reflection depended on hearing and knowing, then it would cease at times.
**[Commentary]** *Yi* means "to cease." The mirror’s illumination of things lies in its lack of feeling; it reflects foe and kin alike, ever impartially. Were it to reflect only when hearing and knowing occur, and not otherwise, its function would be subject to interruption—sometimes active, sometimes idle. How then could its illumination endure? Only because its reflection is unceasing does it earn people’s admiration. And people’s admiration for it never ends, for it is its nature.
**[Annotation]** If it were not its nature to reflect, how could its illumination endure?

The mirror’s capacity to reflect arises naturally; people’s admiration for it follows the workings of creation. Since it does not feign its nature, its reflection is endless. The sage’s love for others is such that people bestow a name upon him. Were they not told, none would know of his love for others.
**[Annotation]** The sage’s love is like the mirror’s reflection.
Yet his deeds benefit all things, so people give him a name. If they did not tell one another, none would know of his love for others.
**[Commentary]** The sage’s grace extends to all living beings, his kindness flows through ten thousand generations. Beings bear his virtue, and people give him a name, passing it on through speech, so that a fine title arises. Without this, how could the name of sage exist? Whether he knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, his love for others never ends.
**[Annotation]** He regards the people as straw dogs, yet the Dao accords with loving others—thus his love is without end. If his love depended on hearing and knowing, then it would wane at times.
**[Commentary]** The sage’s virtue is vast and boundless, his treatment of things impartial. He nurtures all living beings, regards the people as straw dogs—how could he wait for knowledge or hearing before loving them? Only because his compassion is without bias does his virtue never end. This completes the analogy.

People’s contentment with him never ends, for it is their nature.
**[Annotation]** What accords with one’s nature can endure.
**[Commentary]** *An* means "settled." At rest, he shares the virtue of yin; in motion, he moves with the waves of yang. Thus he is without intention in movement or stillness. Therefore, though thunder splits mountains, he remains steadfast; though great winds shake the sea, he is not startled. This is following one’s true nature. If one feigns nature and falsifies feeling, then one will be moved at times. Thus Wang Bi said: "If one does not accord with one’s nature in feeling, how can one long maintain one’s aspirations?"

Returning to one’s old state and old home, one feels a surge of joy.
**[Annotation]** If returning to the familiar brings such joy, how much more so returning to one’s nature?
**[Commentary]** The state and home are metaphors for one’s true nature. One who loses his homeland in youth and wanders in a foreign land feels joy upon gazing back at his native place. How much more so one who has long strayed from the Dao, pursuing the superficial for ages—now returning to the origin, one feels a surge of joy. Even if hills and woods have grown tangled,
**[Annotation]** *Min* means "to join."
with only one in ten recognizing the place, one still feels joy. How much more so when one sees what one has seen and hears what one has heard?
**[Annotation]** Seeing what one has seen before, hearing what one has heard before, one still feels joy—how much more so when one embodies one’s nature?
**[Commentary]** *Min* means "to join." In an old state and home, long abandoned, hills may be rugged, woods overgrown. Of ten visitors, nine recognize it; seeing what they once saw, hearing what they once heard, they feel a surge of joy. How much more so one who has long strayed from the Dao, drowning in the cycle of life and death—suddenly returning to the origin, meeting the true source, returning to the realm of profound mystery, beholding the realm of the supreme Dao. The joy this brings—how could it be easily described?

It is like a tower seventy feet high, suspended in the midst of a crowd.
**[Annotation]** What the crowd is accustomed to, though perilous, seems familiar—how much more so the sage, who is without peril.
**[Commentary]** Seven feet make a *ren*. A tower seven *ren* high is perilously suspended, yet when many people climb it, they feel no fear. Habit shapes nature, so they remain at ease. How much more so when one attains the true—where would one not be at peace?

Ran Xiangshi grasped its center and followed what was already complete.

**[Annotation]** Ran Xiangshi was an ancient sage-king who dwelled in emptiness and followed things, allowing them to complete themselves.

**[Commentary]** Ran Xiangshi was an emperor of non-action prior to the Three Sovereigns. The "ring" is the emptiness at the center. The ancient sage-kings attained the Dao of true emptiness and embodied the wondrousness of the ring’s center. Thus, their Way harmonized with all beings, blending and completing the myriad things. With things, they had no end and no beginning, no moment and no time.

**[Annotation]** Suddenly, they went along with them.

**[Commentary]** "No beginning" means no past; "no end" means no future; "no moment and no time" means no present. Embracing transformation and merging with change, they went along with things—thus, the three times ceased to exist. One who daily transforms with things is the one who does not transform.

**[Annotation]** Daily transforming with things, they were constantly without self; being constantly without self, they were constantly unchanging.

**[Commentary]** Following daily renewal and transforming with things, they moved yet remained quiescent. Thus, they congealed in the singular Dao, abiding in stillness without change. How could they ever abandon this?

**[Annotation]** Why not try relinquishing what one does?

**[Commentary]** *He* means "how." Those who embody emptiness are profoundly attuned to the Creator. Though myriad changes occur, they go along with transformation—how could they ever briefly part from it?

One who models oneself on Heaven yet fails to model oneself on Heaven—

**[Annotation]** Only by modeling nothing does one truly model Heaven.

**[Commentary]** *Shi* means "to emulate"; *Heaven* refers to nature. The great Creator fashions things, moving in accordance with their nature. If one acts with deliberate emulation, one deviates from nature—thus failing to model it. How can one who follows things in all their pursuits regard this as a proper endeavor?

**[Annotation]** Though modeling Heaven, one is still not free from pursuit—how could this be worth regarding as an affair? Modeling Heaven is still insufficient to be called an affair—how much less so if one does not model it?

**[Commentary]** *Xun* means "to chase" or "to seek." One who deliberately emulates creation and goes along with things does not follow their original nature—how could this suffice as the cultivation of one’s affairs? Still possessing something to seek, this is pursuit. If even modeling has something to be called pursuit, how much more so when one abandons oneself to chase things?

The sage has never had Heaven, never had man, never had a beginning, never had things.

**[Commentary]** The sage who attains the center penetrates the ultimate principle, thus transcending both man and Heaven, forgetting both self and things. If there is said to be no end, how could there ever be a beginning? Following nature and harmonizing with the Dao, they no longer model Heaven. They move in step with the world without ceasing; their conduct is complete yet not stagnant—how do they harmonize with it?

**[Annotation]** Only by being utterly without does one obscurely harmonize.

**[Commentary]** *Ti* means "to cease" or "to block." Blending with human affairs, they move in step with the world, engaging with things and adapting to the times without ever ceasing or lacking. Though they fully experience the world’s fortunes and misfortunes, they are never blocked. Whatever they encounter flows freely. Without deliberate emulation, they naturally harmonize with the Dao—how could one imitate this in order to align? The true is inherently ungraspable.

Tang entrusted governance to his minister, the Gatekeeper Yin Deng, who transmitted it for him.

**[Annotation]** He entrusted it to the hundred officials and did not intervene.

**[Commentary]** His surname was Men, his given name Yin. Here, *Gatekeeper* is an official title; his surname was Deng, his given name Heng. The sage-king Tang, forgetting concerns and following things, thus obtained a worthy minister to manage affairs. Though serving as a teacher and mentor, he remained serene and composed, refraining from action.

Following the teacher without confinement—

**[Annotation]** Allowing them to gather naturally, not confining them; letting them disperse naturally, not releasing them.

**[Commentary]** *Cong* means "to allow"; *you* means "to gather." Being empty and inactive, he entrusted the teacher, never accumulating achievements for himself. Attaining this following of completion, he entrusted governance to the minister—

**[Annotation]** The attendants of the chariot-keeper also followed the natural course of things. Tang obtained them, so his name was lent to things while his merit lay not in himself.

**[Commentary]** The worthy minister, receiving the commission, followed things to completion. Attributing merit to the chariot-keeper, his name did not reside in himself. This name and method were in surplus, attaining their dual manifestation.

**[Annotation]** Names and methods are merely traces of the past, not what is truly sufficient. Thus, it is said: one who is effortlessly without intention entrusts governance to the various ministers, so their names and traces are both manifested in them.

**[Commentary]** *Yingran* means "without intention"; *xian* means "to manifest." The name of completing things and the method of sagely traces both belong to the teacher, not to the sage. Thus, the two matters of name and method are both manifested in them. Effortlessly at ease, their merit is accomplished without claim.

Confucius exhausted his thoughts to serve as their mentor.

**[Annotation]** Confucius said: "What thought? What worry?" Thoughts are already exhausted. If there were the slightest lingering thought, how could one remain still and unmoving, responding endlessly to stimuli, aiding the natural course of the myriad things?

**[Commentary]** *Fu* means "to assist"; *jin* means "to exhaust." The sage Confucius, forgetting concerns and exhausting thoughts, thus opened and transformed the multitude, assisting their natural endowment. If the slightest intention remained, how could he sit in forgetfulness and respond to stimuli?

Rong Chengshi said: "Remove the days, and there are no years."

**[Annotation]** The reason we have years and retain days is because of life and death. If there were no life and no death, the reckoning of years and days would be removed.

**[Commentary]** Rong Cheng was an ancient sage-king. Years and days are merely names for the seasons. Reckoning time in years and days arises from life and death. When life and death cease, years and days are removed.

There is no inside, no outside.

**[Annotation]** Without self and other, there is no inside or outside.

**[Commentary]** *Inside* is the self; *outside* is things. Reckoning life and death gives rise to inside and outside. When years and days are dispelled, where can self and things reside?

Wei Ying and Tian Hou Mou made a covenant, but Tian Hou Mou betrayed it. Wei Ying grew enraged and was about to send an assassin after him.

**[Commentary]** Ying was the name of King Hui of Wei. Tian Hou was Duke Wei of Qi, named Mou, son of Duke Huan and descendant of Tian Heng, hence called Tian Hou. The two states of Qi and Wei had sworn an oath and formed an alliance, vowing not to invade one another. Soon after the alliance, Duke Wei betrayed it, so the Marquis of Wei flew into a rage and was about to dispatch an assassin to kill him. Their alliance had been made in the twenty-sixth year of Duke Wei of Qi and the eighth year of King Hui of Wei.

Xishou, hearing of this, deemed it shameful and said: "You are a lord of ten thousand chariots, yet you would follow the path of a commoner in seeking vengeance."

**[Commentary]** Xishou was an official title, akin to the modern "Tiger Warriors." A grandson of the ducal house, named Yan, held this office. A feudal state with ten thousand war chariots was called a "lord." A *commoner* refers to a man and woman paired without official rank. *Following vengeance* means to exact retribution. A ruler who lets anger rule him will bring corpses and bloodshed; now you would send a commoner alone to assassinate in vengeance—this is no deed for a lord of ten thousand chariots, and thus it is shameful.

Yan requested two hundred thousand armored troops to attack Qi on his lord’s behalf, capturing its people and seizing its cattle and horses.

**[Commentary]** General Sun Yan requested the authority to receive the battle-axe and lead two hundred thousand armored soldiers to attack Qi’s cities, certain of victory. Thereupon, he would plunder the populace, bind their cattle and horses, and distribute rewards to the soldiers for their merits.

He would cause the Qi lord’s inner heat to erupt upon his back, then uproot his state. After Ji fled, he would strike his back and break his spine.

**[Commentary]** Ji, surnamed Tian, was a Qi general. *Strike* and *break* mean to beat. With the state destroyed and its people lost, resentment and anger would fester in the heart, causing heat to accumulate and abscesses to erupt upon the back. Once the state was overthrown and its ruler and generals captured, he would strike their backs, break their spines, and return in triumph. Was this not gratifying?

Jizi, hearing of this, deemed it shameful and said: "To build a city wall seventy feet high, only to tear it down once it reaches that height—this is the toil that convict laborers lament."

**[Commentary]** Ji was a surname; in ancient times, it was a term of...

Xi was a worthy minister of Wei. *Xumi* refers to convict laborers. Jizi, who embraced the Dao, opposed military campaigns; when Xishou requested troops, he advanced in shame to remonstrate. A city wall of seventy feet requires no small effort—once completed, to destroy it without cause is the very suffering of convict laborers. This is the analogy he drew. Now, for seven years no war has arisen: this is the foundation of Your Majesty’s reign. Yan is a disturber of order and must not be heeded.

**[Commentary]** For seven years, weapons have lain still; the martial has been laid aside in favor of culture and governance—this is the great foundation of a true king. Yet Xishou now sows chaos; his counsel must not be followed.

Huazi, hearing this, deemed it disgraceful and said: “He who speaks well of attacking Qi is a disturber of order; he who speaks well of not attacking is also a disturber of order; and he who calls both the advocate of attack and the advocate of non-attack disturbers of order is yet another disturber of order.”

**[Commentary]** Hua was his surname; *zi* is a title of virtue. He, too, was a worthy minister of Wei. He who speaks skillfully in favor of attacking Qi—meaning to stir up weapons and war—is a disturber of order, namely Gongsun Yan. He who speaks skillfully against attacking seeks to preserve the king’s great foundation and surpass his enemies, yet harbors expectations and thus remains a disturber of order—this is Jizi. As for him who declares both the advocate of attack and the advocate of non-attack to be disturbers of order, he has not yet forgotten words or put the Dao into practice, still clinging to right and wrong in his heart, and thus has not escaped being a disturber of order—this is Huazi speaking of himself.

The ruler said: “Then what should be done?”

**[Commentary]** Huazi’s teachings ran deep, and the king could not fathom their intent, so he asked what the meaning was and what course to follow.

He replied: “Your Majesty should seek only the Dao.”

**[Commentary]** The Dao is clear, empty, and serene, transcending both things and self. Thus he urged the king to seek it, that his desires might grow few, his steps sure upon the Way, and strife vanish of itself.

Master Hui, hearing this, went to see Dai Jinren.

**[Commentary]** Dai Jinren was a worthy man of Liang. His surname was Dai, and his style Jinren. Master Hui, having heard Huazi’s pure words, feared the king of Wei might not yet awaken, so he brought in Dai Jinren to resolve his doubts.

Dai Jinren said: “There is a creature called the snail—do you know it?”

“Yes,” the king replied.

**[Annotation]** The snail is most minute, yet bears two horns.

**[Commentary]** The snail is an insect resembling a small spiral shell; commonly called the “yellow calf,” it is also known as the snail, and has four horns. “Do you know it?” “Yes,” the king of Wei answered, “I recognize it.”

On the snail’s left horn is a kingdom called Chushi, and on its right horn a kingdom called Manshi. From time to time, they war over territory, leaving tens of thousands of corpses in their wake. The victor pursues the vanquished for fifteen days before returning.

**[Annotation]** If one truly knew that what they contend over is as trifling as this, there would be no strife under heaven.

**[Commentary]** On the snail’s two horns, two states exist. Manshi and Chushi wage war again and again, inflicting no small slaughter, and their advances and retreats consume much time. This is the analogy he drew.

The king said: “Alas!”

Is this mere empty talk?

**[Annotation]** The words spoken are so strange and far removed from human nature that the king sighs in doubt, suspecting they are not true.

The guest said: "Allow me to prove their truth to Your Majesty. Do you believe that the four directions and the realms above and below have limits?"

**[Annotation]** The guest tests the king’s understanding: Are the four directions and the realms above and below bounded or not?

This principle applies to all things, and now it is being demonstrated to the Marquis of Wei.

The king said: "They are without limit."

**[Annotation]** The Marquis of Wei answers: The four directions and the realms above and below are boundless.

The guest said: "If one’s mind roams through the boundless and then returns to the lands of men—those within the reach of human footsteps—do they seem to exist or not?"

**[Annotation]** The lands where human footsteps reach are called "the lands of men," referring to the world within the four seas today.

"Exist" means to be present; "not" means to be absent. If the mind wanders through the infinite and then compares it to the Nine Provinces, the difference in scale is such that they seem as if they exist and yet do not.

The king said: "So it is."

**[Annotation]** Today, we consider the four seas vast, but when measured against the boundless, they seem as if they exist and yet do not.

**[Annotation]** "So it is" means the king acknowledges that the guest’s words are not false.

The guest said: "Within the lands of men lies Wei; within Wei lies Liang; within Liang lies Your Majesty. Does Your Majesty differ from the kingdom of Manshi?"

**[Annotation]** Formerly in Hedong, the state was called Wei. When Wei was pressed by the mighty Qin, its capital was moved to Liang. Since Liang arose from Wei, it is said that within Wei lies Liang.

"Differ" means to be distinct. Your Majesty’s kingdom is but one among the Six Directions. When comparing scale, it seems as if it exists and yet does not. What difference is there between you and Manshi? This completes the analogy.

The king said: "There is no difference."

**[Annotation]** Your Majesty and Manshi are both finite things. Being finite, neither great nor small can be measured against the infinite. Even heaven and earth, though vast, are as nothing within the boundless—how much less Wei, Liang within it, and Your Majesty within Liang, that they should be worth contending over?

**[Annotation]** The king realizes that what he contends over is no different from the struggle on the snail’s horns.

The guest departed, and the king stood lost in thought, as if something had slipped away.

**[Annotation]** He mourns the pettiness of what he contends over.

**[Annotation]** *Changran* describes a look of regret. When the man from Jin finished speaking and left, the king, recognizing his own folly, stood in sorrowful regret, his heart heavy as if something were lost.

After the guest left, Huizi came to see the king. The king said: "That guest is a great man—even a sage is not his equal."

**[Annotation]** "Sage" refers to Yao and Shun. The principles expounded by the man from Jin are so vast and profound that even the deeds of Yao and Shun cannot compare.

Huizi said: "When one blows into a pipe, there is a deep sound; but when one blows across the ring of a sword, there is only a faint whistle. Yao and Shun are praised by men; yet to speak of Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren is like that faint whistle."

**[Annotation]** It is scarcely worth hearing.

**[Annotation]** *Xiao* is a deep sound; *xuè* is a faint one. Blowing into a bamboo pipe produces a deep sound, but blowing across a sword’s ring yields only a faint one. Yao of Tang is praised by the world, yet to extol such virtues before Jinren is no different from the faint whistle of a sword’s ring—scarcely worth hearing.

When Confucius traveled to Chu, he lodged at the home of a wine-seller by Ant Mound.

**[Annotation]** Ant Mound is the name of a mound. The wine-seller was a family that sold wine, and their home was at the foot of the mound, hence the name.

When Master Kong journeyed to Chu as an envoy, he rested by the roadside at the home of a wine-seller.

His neighbor had a household of husband, wife, servants, and concubines who climbed to the top of the mound. Zilu said: "What is this bustling crowd doing?"

**[Annotation]** *Ji* means high; *jiji* describes a throng. When Confucius traveled as an envoy, his disciples were many, and their horses and carriages made an imposing sight. Thus, the neighbors—men and women alike—gathered atop the wine-seller’s mound to watch Master Kong. Unfamiliar with them, Zilu asked in surprise.

Confucius said: "They are the servants of a sage."

**[Annotation]** In ancient times, virtuous gentlemen were all called sages, so Confucius referred to Yiliao of Shounan as a sage. He meant that the crowd of servants and concubines climbing the mound were the retainers of Yiliao of Shounan.

"He buries himself among the people,"

**[Annotation]** He lives as one with the common folk.

"and hides himself at the margins."

**[Annotation]** He does not seek glory in advancement nor wither in retreat.

**[Annotation]** He mingles with the dust and mud, living as one with the common people, concealing his virtue—thus, he buries himself among the people. Neither seeking glory in advancement nor withering in retreat, he hides himself at the margins.

"His fame fades,"

**[Annotation]** He diminishes his name.

"yet his aspirations are boundless,"

**[Annotation]** His plans are for life itself.

**[Annotation]** "Fame" refers to reputation; "fades" means to vanish. Unconcerned with honor or disgrace, he effaces his name. Immersed in the ultimate Dao, his heart is infinite.

"Though his mouth speaks, his heart never speaks,"

**[Annotation]** All his words are those of the world.

**[Annotation]** His mouth responds to the world, but his heart remains serene—thus, though he speaks, his heart does not.

"and though he lives among men, his heart disdains to join them."

**[Annotation]** He lives differently from the world.

**[Annotation]** His Dao is at odds with the俗, so he opposes the world. Free from worldly burdens, his heart does not align with others—both his actions and his heart are distinct.

"He is one who sinks on dry land,"

**[Annotation]** A hermit among men, like one who sinks without water.

**[Annotation]** Serene and detached, he is like one who sinks without water—this is called sinking on dry land.

Is this not the Market South’s Yi Liao?

**[Annotation]** His surname was Xiong, his courtesy name Yi Liao, and as he dwelt south of the market, he was called Market South Yi Liao.

Zilu requested to go and summon him.

**[Annotation]** You heard that Yi Liao, a worthy who sinks on dry land, was there, and asked to go to his dwelling to summon him.

Confucius said: "Enough.

**[Annotation]** *Yi* means "stop."

He will certainly not come—best to cease and not pursue it. He knows that I am aware of him,

**[Annotation]** *Zhuo* means "clear."

and knowing that I am bound for Chu, he takes it for certain that I will urge the King of Chu to summon him. Thus he will take me for a flatterer.

**[Annotation]** *Bi* refers to Yi Liao. *Zhuo* means "clear." He knows that I clearly recognize Yi Liao as a worthy who sinks on dry land, and that upon reaching Chu, I will surely recommend him to the king. If so, he will regard me as a sycophant.

One such as this would feel shame even to hear the words of a flatterer—how much more to meet him in person?

**[Annotation]** A man who sinks on dry land follows his nature with utter sincerity. To him, even hearing the words of a devious flatterer brings shame—how much more to see his person with his own eyes?

Then why assume he remains here?

**[Annotation]** Better to leave him be and follow his will.

**[Annotation]** *Er* means "you." *Cun* means "to be present." Long concealed in shadow and silent, he must have fled long ago—why do you still summon him as if he were here?

Zilu went to see, and his dwelling was empty.

**[Annotation]** He had indeed fled.

**[Annotation]** Zhong You lacked discernment and did not heed his master’s words. He went to Yi Liao’s home, hoping to behold such great virtue. But as his refusal of office was so resolute, Yi Liao had already fled, leaving his house vacant.

The Warden of Changwu asked Zilao: "When governing, do not act recklessly; when ordering the people, do not act carelessly."

**[Annotation]** *Lǔmǎng* and *mièliè* mean "rash and incomplete," failing to fulfill one’s proper role.

**[Annotation]** Changwu was a place named for its tall parasol trees. *Feng ren* refers to the warden who guarded its borders. Zilao was a disciple of Confucius, surnamed Qin, a minister of Song. *Wei zheng* means "to enact transformation." *Zhi min* means "to govern."

Rashness means acting without mindfulness. Carelessness means treating matters lightly. The people are the foundation of the state, and when the foundation is firm, the state is at peace. One must attend to nurturing the people with care and must not lightly disturb them. The Warden was a man of the Dao, and thus he admonished Zilao.

Formerly, when I cultivated grain, if I plowed rashly, the harvest repaid me with rashness; if I weeded carelessly, the harvest repaid me with carelessness.

**[Annotation]** *Wei he* means "to plant grain." *Yun* means "to pull weeds." If the plowing is shallow and the hoeing incomplete, when autumn comes, the fine grain will be sparse—all due to negligence, and thus the governance is repaid in kind.

The next year, I changed my methods, deepened the plowing, and tended the fields thoroughly.

**[Annotation]** Fulfilling one’s proper role to the utmost is the perfection of non-action.

The grain flourished and multiplied, and I was sated for the entire year.

**[Annotation]** *Bian* means "to change." *Geng* means "to cultivate." *Liang* means "to weed." Last year’s harvest was meager, and hunger prevailed. This year, I altered my methods and plowed deeply. With deep plowing and diligent hoeing, the grain stalks grew lush. The kernels ripened abundantly, and the year’s bounty was sufficient—thus it was fitting.

Zhuangzi heard of this and said: Nowadays, when people cultivate their bodies and order their minds, many resemble what the Warden described.

**[Annotation]** People of this age are frivolous and superficial, chasing after desires without rest. When it comes to ordering body and mind, they are like what the Warden spoke of.

Zhuang Zhou heard this and expounded upon it: They flee from Heaven, depart from their nature, extinguish their emotions, and lose their spirit—all for the sake of pursuing the many.

**[Annotation]** Fleeing, departing, extinguishing, and losing are all caused by pursuing the many. If each were to reach its extreme, where would there be rest?

**[Annotation]** To escape the principles of nature, scatter one’s pure and harmonious nature, extinguish one’s true emotions, and lose the way of nurturing the spirit—all this stems from chasing after what lies beyond one’s proper role and being entangled in action.

Thus, those who are rash with their nature give rise to the calamities of desire and aversion, which assail the nature like reeds.

**[Annotation]** Sparrows and reeds harm millet and sorghum; desires and aversions injure the true nature.

**[Annotation]** *Jiu wei* are reeds. The heart’s desires and aversions often breed misfortune. Just as reeds harm millet and sorghum, desires and aversions wound the true nature—all because of rashness and superficiality.

When the reeds first sprout, they may yet support my form.

**[Annotation]** When they spread and grow, the spirit and qi flow freely.

**[Annotation]** *Jian jia* are also reeds. When noxious weeds first sprout, they are easy to remove, but once they spread and grow lush, they inevitably harm the millet and sorghum. Likewise, when desires first arise, they are easy to restrain, but once one is submerged in them, vigilance must begin in the subtlest signs. Thus Laozi said, "Their ends are not easily planned."

They creep and uproot my nature.

**[Annotation]** Desires and aversions draw out the nature beyond its proper bounds.

**[Annotation]** *Xun* means "to draw." *Zhuo* means "to uproot." When desires and aversions entice the heart, they uproot the true nature, drawing it beyond its proper bounds.

They burst forth in sores and ulcers, indiscriminate in their eruption—boils, scabies, abscesses, internal heat, and turbid essence.

**[Annotation]** This is the retribution for rashness.

Thus, those who cultivate their nature must not fail to align with their proper measure.

**[Annotation]** *Kui lou* are cold sores. *Piao ju* are hot, toxic swellings. *Yong* are a type of abscess. *Sou gao* refers to turbid urine and seminal loss. Indulging in sensory pleasures and drowning in sights and sounds, the spirit becomes confused and the body weakened. Diseases erupt without regard for place.

Bo Ju studied under Lao Cong and said: I request to travel throughout the world.

**[Annotation]** Bo was his surname; Ju, his given name. A scholar who embraced the Dao, he was a disciple of Laozi. He requested to journey through the world to observe customs and examine the conditions of things.

Lao Cong said: Desist. The world is the same as this.

**[Annotation]** Laozi stopped him and refused his request, saying that the conditions of things in the world were no different from here.

He asked again, and Lao Cong said: Where will you begin?

**[Annotation]** With repeated and earnest requests, he persisted. Laozi then asked where he intended to go first.

He said: I will begin in Qi.

**[Annotation]** Bo Ju was from Lu, near Qi. The people of Qi were without the Dao, so he wished to go there first.

When he arrived in Qi, he saw a man who had been executed. He pushed and straightened the body, removed his court robes, and draped them over the corpse.

**[Annotation]** He traveled to Qi to observe its customs and suddenly saw a criminal who had been put to death. He pushed and straightened the body, then removed his court robes to cover it.

He cried out to Heaven and wept, saying: You! You! The world suffers great calamities, and you alone have been the first to encounter them. They say: Do not steal. Do not kill.

**[Annotation]** Killing is a great calamity—referring to the matters below. Since great calamities exist, even if one is warned not to do such things, how can they be avoided?

**[Annotation]** *Li* means "to encounter." *Zai* means "disaster." He cried out to Heaven, weeping in sorrow for the man’s unjust suffering, and thus repeated, "You! You!" Stealing and killing are great disasters in the world—why was this man the first to suffer them? The details of these great calamities are listed below.

**[Annotation]** Another interpretation: The so-called executed man was a court official. He was forcibly pushed to take the court robes, enmeshed in the net of the law to ensnare the people. Thus, he cried out to Heaven and wept, making clear that the disaster arose from this. The preemptive net is described below.

When honor and disgrace are established, one then sees what ails the world.

**[Annotation]** When each attains what is proper, there is no honor or disgrace. When gains and losses are in turmoil, honor and disgrace arise. Once honor and disgrace are established, one boasts of what is called disgrace and strives for what is called honor.

Amidst the scramble for vainglory, what else but affliction?
**[Annotation]** Chariots and caps mark honor; execution and shame mark disgrace. To scramble and grasp for these—what else but affliction?

Wealth and goods accumulate, then one sees what men contend for.
**[Annotation]** If contentment were deemed riches, what would there be to contend for?
**[Annotation]** Treasures pile up, and the race for them begins.

Now, to establish what afflicts men, to amass what they contend for, to exhaust and entrap their bodies without respite—can one hope to avoid reaching this state?
**[Annotation]** When superiors have their preferences, inferiors cannot remain at ease in their proper stations.
**[Annotation]** Rewarding with chariots and caps, enticing with pearls and jades, the masses are thus set into a ceaseless scramble. How then can each be made to abide in their proper station?

The rulers of old held that success lay with the people, and failure lay with themselves.
**[Annotation]** If the ruler committed no failure, the people would naturally succeed.
**[Annotation]** Attributing merit to others, they held that success lay with the people; bearing the inauspicious fate of the state, they held that failure lay with themselves.

They held that rectitude lay with the people, and crookedness lay with themselves.
**[Annotation]** If the ruler committed no crookedness, the people would naturally be rectified.
**[Annotation]** Governing through non-action and entrusting matters to things, rectitude lay with the people; drawing blame to themselves and taking responsibility, crookedness lay with themselves.

Thus, if any form lost its proper form, they would withdraw and take the blame upon themselves.
**[Annotation]** Why would the forms and natures of things be lost? All stem from the ruler’s interference, leading to such calamities—hence, they took the blame upon themselves.
**[Annotation]** Each person receives qi differently and is endowed with distinct capacities. If each were allowed to exercise their abilities, all things would find their proper place. If any being lost its place and its form and nature were harmed, they would draw the fault to themselves and withdraw to take responsibility. This was the way of Tang of Yin.

Now, it is not so.
**[Annotation]** The pace differs with the times, and the purity of the age has changed. Thus, those who drive things today no longer act in this manner.

They conceal the nature of things and delude the ignorant.
**[Annotation]** To return to one’s nature is concealment; to employ one’s nature is manifestation. Thus, when things are made manifest, all recognize them.
**[Annotation]** The laws and statutes they enact all run counter to the nature of things. They hide the names of offenses, leaving the foolish unaware—hence, the multitude of transgressions.

They make great difficulties and punish those who dare not comply.
**[Annotation]** When things are made easy, all dare to comply.
**[Annotation]** Since the laws are difficult to determine and hard to follow, those who inevitably violate them are punished.

They impose heavy burdens and penalize those who cannot bear them.
**[Annotation]** If the burdens were light, all could bear them.

They set distant paths and condemn those who do not arrive.
**[Annotation]** If the distance matched their strength, all would arrive.
**[Annotation]** To demand completion of heavy tasks from those of weak strength, or to punish those who arrive late when the journey is long and the deadline short—both are impossible.

When the people know their strength is exhausted, they resort to deceit to continue.
**[Annotation]** To evade punishment.
**[Annotation]** When wisdom and strength are exhausted yet punishment is unavoidable, fear of punishment drives them to resort to deceit.

Deceit emerges daily, so how can the officers and people not be deceitful?
**[Annotation]** When the ruler daily fosters deceit, how can the officers and people preserve their authenticity?
**[Annotation]** The wind of cunning and deceit arises daily, and falsehoods multiply like weeds—where then can one find truth?

When strength is insufficient, there is deceit; when knowledge is insufficient, there is fraud; when wealth is insufficient, there is theft. To whom can one justly assign blame for the acts of theft and fraud?
**[Annotation]** Blame lies with those above.
**[Annotation]** When wisdom and strength are exhausted, deceit and fraud inevitably arise; when taxes and levies grow ever more urgent, greed and theft inevitably follow. All stem from the ruler’s lack of virtue and the proliferation of laws. If one could forget attachments, relinquish self-interest, and not prize treasures, then blame would lie with those above—how could the common people be at fault?

Qu Boyu, at sixty years of age, underwent sixty transformations.
**[Annotation]** He was also able to follow the world without being bound by self and other.
**[Annotation]** His surname was Qu, given name Ai, courtesy name Boyu—a worthy minister of Wei. His abundant virtue and lofty wisdom illuminated the empty truths, enabling him to renew himself daily and change with each passing year.

Never did he not begin with what was deemed right only to end by condemning it as wrong.
**[Annotation]** Flowing with things and expanding freely, such are the changes in the sentiments of things.
**[Annotation]** At the start of the year, he called it right; by the year’s end, he called it wrong. Within a single year, right and wrong emerged in constant flux—thus, what was right at the beginning was ultimately condemned as wrong.

He did not know whether what is now deemed right is not the wrong of fifty-nine years past.
**[Annotation]** The changes in the sentiments of things have no end.
**[Annotation]** Thus, he transformed into the new and deemed it right; the old having passed, he deemed it wrong. Therefore, last year’s wrong became this year’s right, and this year’s right would become next year’s wrong. Those who cling to right and wrong, who stagnate in the new and cling to the old, are the ones who invert the proper order.

Thus, the Master of Rong Cheng said: "Remove the days, and there are no years." Qu Ai understood this, hence he transformed with things.

All things have life, yet none see their root; they emerge, yet none see their gate.
**[Annotation]** Without root or gate, suddenly and naturally arising—hence, none see them.

Only those who have no life and no emergence can perceive their gate and fathom their root.
**[Annotation]** They arise with change, their life without root or origin; they emerge with transformation, their emergence without gate or door. Since it is said there is no root or gate, it is known there is no life or emergence. If life and emergence have no gate, how can one model the years?

All men honor the knowledge of what they know, yet none know to rely on the knowledge of what they do not know before attaining knowledge—can this not be called great doubt?
**[Annotation]** What I do not know, there are those among things who know it. Thus, employing the knowledge of things, there is nothing one does not know.

Alone relying on my own knowledge, how meager is what I know! Now, if one does not rely on things to know yet exalts one’s own knowledge, then things will not inform me—how could this not be great doubt?

**[Annotation]** What is known is worldly knowledge; what is unknown is true knowledge. The common crowd all honors discriminating knowledge, sharpens their passions in grasping and rejecting, yet none can depend on their discriminating wisdom to illumine the true source—truly, they are people of great delusion. Enough! Enough! And nowhere to flee.

**[Commentary]** If one cannot employ that, then one’s body has no place to lodge.

**[Annotation]** *Yi* means "to cease." Those who sharpen their passions in grasping and rejecting would do better to rest; they will inevitably encounter misfortune, with no place to escape their form. Is this what is meant by "so it is" and "is it so"?

**[Commentary]** Those who claim it is so—yet the world does not agree.

**[Annotation]** Each affirms what they affirm, each approves what they approve; opposing one another, who is right and who is wrong?

Confucius questioned the Grand Scribe Da Tao, Bo Changqian, and Xi Wei:

**[Annotation]** *Taishi* is an official title. The three below are all names of scribal officials. The matters he questioned are listed in sequence below.

He said: "Duke Ling of Wei indulged in wine and drowned in pleasure, neglecting the governance of his state; he devoted himself to hunting and archery, ignoring the affairs of the feudal lords. For what reason was he called 'Ling'—the Illustrious Duke?"

**[Annotation]** *Bi* refers to a great net. *Yi* means shooting with an arrow tied to a cord. Such vulgar and reckless rulers indulge in lewd music and wine, hunt birds and beasts, neglect state governance, and fail to attend the assemblies and diplomatic exchanges of the feudal lords. You, as scribal officials, must determine their posthumous titles—how can one so devoid of the Way be called *Ling*—the Illustrious?

Da Tao replied: "It is so precisely because it is so."

**[Commentary]** *Ling* is the posthumous title for one without the Way.

**[Annotation]** According to the *Posthumous Titles* of the Duke of Zhou: "One who is chaotic yet unharmed is called *Ling*." *Ling* is thus the title for one without the Way. This is because his lack of the Way led to his being titled *Ling*—hence, "it is so precisely because it is so."

Bo Changqian said: "Duke Ling had three wives, with whom he bathed together in the same vessel."

**[Commentary]** Men and women bathing together—this is without propriety.

"Officer Shi Qiu presented himself for service, bearing the ritual gifts, and the Duke grasped the silk and supported him with his arms."

**[Commentary]** Using *qiu* (loach) as a skewer for the ritual gifts was a labor of service, so the Duke grasped the silk and supported him to prevent the completion of the ritual—this is why he was deemed respectful and virtuous. The *bi* (silk) were the gifts for the officer.

**[Annotation]** *Lan* refers to a bathing vessel. His surname was Shi, his given name Qiu—he was a worthy minister of Wei. *Bi* means silk. Furthermore, the *Posthumous Titles* states: "One whose virtue is keenly perceptive is called *Ling*." Though he allowed men and women to bathe together, he also presented worthy men for service. When the Duke saw that Shi Qiu was a good minister, he was deeply ashamed and remorseful. He sent someone to grasp the silk and support him with his arms, comforting and escorting him away to prevent the completion of the ritual. Such reverence for the worthy is the mark of an enlightened ruler—thus he was titled *Ling*, for *Ling* is the title for one with the Way. His negligence was extreme, yet his respect for the worthy was so solemn—this is why he was called Duke Ling.

**[Commentary]** He sought to use his reverence for the worthy to compensate for his private indulgences. *Ling* has two meanings, and cannot be called purely good—hence Confucius questioned it.

**[Annotation]** Though his impropriety in bathing with women was extreme, upon seeing a worthy man, he suddenly displayed solemn respect. This was taken as evidence of the Way, and so he was titled *Ling*.

Xi Wei said: "When Duke Ling died, divination for burial in the ancestral tomb was inauspicious, but divination for burial at Shaqiu was auspicious. After digging several *ren* deep, they found a stone outer coffin. Washing it and examining it, they saw an inscription that read: *‘Not relying on his son, Duke Ling will seize and bury him here.’* Duke Ling had been *Ling* for a long time indeed!"

**[Commentary]** *Son* refers to Kuai Kui. The inscription meant: *‘Not relying on his son, Duke Ling will seize this place from you.’* All things have their predetermined fate, so future events may be known. Thus, whatever one must do, one cannot but do; whatever one must not do, one cannot do. Yet fools believe it lies within their own power—is this not delusion? How could those two understand this?"

**[Commentary]** They merely recognized what had already come to pass, not that what had come to pass arose from spontaneity.

**[Annotation]** Shaqiu is a place name, located north of the Meng Ford of the Yellow River. *Son* refers to Kuai Kui. This is to clarify that posthumous titles are determined before any sign appears, not subject to the fluctuations of human sentiment. Thus, the stone outer coffin at Shaqiu bore its inscription beforehand. How could it rely on Kuai Kui before the Duke could seize the burial site? How could Shi and Changqian possibly comprehend this?

Lesser Knowledge asked Grand Master Tiao:

**[Annotation]** One whose wisdom is narrow and inferior is called *Lesser Knowledge*. *Grand* means great; *Master* means upright.

Grand Master Tiao embodied the vastness of the Dao and the greatness of virtue, impartial and selfless, further harmonizing and aligning all things—hence the name *Grand Master Tiao*. Here, a hypothetical interlocutor is introduced to discuss the principles of the Way.

The interlocutor asked: "What are the words of the village and hamlet?"

**[Annotation]** In ancient times, ten households formed a *qiu*, and twenty households a *li*. Customs differed between villages and hamlets, so this dialogue is posed to elucidate the matter.

Grand Master Tiao replied: "The words of the village and hamlet amalgamate the customs of ten clans and a hundred names."

**[Annotation]** Gathering the customs of ten clans and the names of a hundred individuals, they are synthesized to form a shared custom. This unites differences into sameness and disperses sameness into differences. Now, if one points to the hundred parts of a horse yet fails to grasp the horse itself, it is only when the horse stands before us, its hundred parts assembled, that we call it a horse.

**[Annotation]** Just as the words of the village and hamlet are gathered to form a custom—uniting differences into sameness—so too does one who teaches adapt to circumstances and guide beings, dispersing sameness into differences. It is like pointing to the hundred parts of a horse—head, tail, waist, and spine—none of which alone constitute the horse; this is dispersing sameness into differences. Yet when the horse stands tethered before us, this is uniting differences into sameness.

Thus, hills and mountains accumulate the lowly to become lofty; rivers and streams converge waters to become vast; the great person unites all to become impartial.

**[Annotation]** To be without self-interest in the world is to unify the customs of all under heaven.

**[Annotation]** Piling earth and stone forms hills and mountains; gathering rivulets creates rivers and seas. Likewise, the sage, without fixed intent, adapts teachings to beings, thereby uniting the eight directions, harmonizing all under heaven, so that Chinese and barbarians alike tread the same path, and near and far know no partiality.

Therefore, what enters from without has a master yet is not grasped;

**[Annotation]** *From without* means that the sage’s teachings enter from outside and emerge from within, following the inclinations of beings. Thus, though presiding as master, there is nothing held fast.

what issues from within has rectitude yet is not resisted.

**[Annotation]** What enters from without is the transformation wrought by the great person; what issues from within is the nature of beings and things. Each nature attains its proper state, so the people do not act contrary to their hearts. Transformation is utterly impartial, so the master holds nothing fast. Thus, villages and hamlets are united with all under heaven, the myriad things are made one, and all differences are leveled.

**[Annotation]** *From within* also means that the black-haired people and all beings possess their proper natures. Following their hearts, they receive the imperial wind, and since it accords with their inclinations, they comply without resistance.

The four seasons have distinct qi, yet Heaven does not bestow them, and so the year is complete;

**[Annotation]** The distinct qi arise of themselves; thus, they endure perpetually. If they were bestowed by Heaven yet originally absent, they would at times cease.

**[Annotation]** *Bestow* means to grant. Spring’s warmth, summer’s heat, autumn’s coolness, and winter’s cold arise from nature, so the year’s sequence is complete. If it were as though Heaven granted them, they would at times cease.

The five offices have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not favor them, and so the state is well-governed;

**[Annotation]** The distinct duties arise from their inherent capacities; thus, they are entrusted with them, not favored by partiality.

**[Annotation]** The *five offices* refer to the ancient system of establishing offices based on the five phases. The spring and autumn offices each have their responsibilities. The ruler, in profound stillness, entrusts them without partiality, so the realm within the four seas is clear and tranquil, and the state is at peace.

The civil and martial virtues of the great person are not bestowed, and so their power is complete;

**[Annotation]** The civil is inherently civil, the martial inherently martial; they are not bestowed by the great person. If they were granted and thus capable, they would at times be lacking. This is not only true of civil and martial virtues—all natures are thus.

**[Annotation]** Civil ministers and martial generals are appointed according to their talents and entrusted with their duties; they are not granted by the sage. Impartial toward all things, the Dao and its power are thus perfectly complete.

The myriad things have distinct principles, yet the Dao is not partial, and so it is nameless.

**[Annotation]** The multitude of beings differ, each following its distinct nature—some dwell in nests, others in caves; some walk the earth, others fly through the sky. Yet nurturing and poisoning them, all attain self-sufficiency. Each thing fulfills its principle, so the Dao has no merit.

Nameless, it is without action; without action, yet there is nothing it does not do.

**[Annotation]** Names are limited by reality, so it is without action; realities act of themselves, so there is nothing it does not do.

**[Annotation]** Merit returns to things, so it is called *without action*; not clinging to this action, yet there is nothing it does not do.

Time has its endings and beginnings; the world undergoes transformations.

**[Annotation]** Thus, those without fixed intent follow along.

**[Annotation]** *Time* refers to the four seasons cycling in succession. *World* refers to human affairs, shifting and changing without constancy.

Fortune and misfortune flow ceaselessly;

**[Annotation]** Flowing and reversing.

**[Annotation]** *Flowing ceaselessly* describes their movement. The qi of Heaven’s seasons—cold and heat—pass and do not remain constant. Human fortunes and misfortunes—how could they long endure? Thus, the *Laozi* states: "Misfortune is where fortune leans; fortune is where misfortune lurks."

There are times when what seems contrary is fitting;

**[Annotation]** What is perverse here may be fitting there.

**[Annotation]** *Contrary* means perverse. The inclinations of beings have no fixed standard. What is perverse here may be fitting there, so those who comprehend the Dao do not cling to opposition or compliance.

Each clings to its own perspective;

**[Annotation]** Each trusts in what it deems right and cannot depart from it.

**[Annotation]** *Clings* means pursues. *Perspective* means orientation. With right and wrong entangled, each clings to its own view, so their orientations differ.

where there is rectitude, there is also deviation.

**[Annotation]** What is rectified here may deviate there.

**[Annotation]** What is rectified here may be deviant there. This clarifies that the inclinations of beings are inverted, differing in orientation.

Compared to a great marsh, all its hundred materials are measured;

**[Annotation]** No timber is discarded.

**[Annotation]** *Compared* means likened. *Measured* means assessed. In a vast marsh, the forests are abundant. Each timber is assessed for its use—none is discarded.

The great person selects things in the same way. Observe the great mountain: trees and stones share the same foundation.

**[Annotation]** Uniting the different as one.

**[Annotation]** *Foundation* means base. Stones may be large or small, trees coarse or fine, yet together they form the mountain’s base—this is uniting the different as one. This is called the discourse of the village.

**[Annotation]** If it holds true in a village, it may be known throughout the world.

**[Annotation]** This summarizes the preceding meaning.

Lesser Knowledge said: Then is calling it the *Dao* sufficient?

**[Annotation]** To name it the *Dao*—does this name for the *Dao* fall short of the principle? Desiring to clarify that the supreme *Dao* is nameless, he raises this question.

Grand Duke Diao said: Not so. Now, the count of things does not stop at ten thousand, yet we call them the "ten thousand things" because we name and refer to them by their greatest number.

**[Annotation]** Things with number do not stop at ten thousand—how much less can the numberless *Dao* be deemed sufficient?

**[Annotation]** *Limit* means boundary. *Name* means to speak. Things with form are boundless, yet when people speak of them, they limit them to "ten thousand things," taking the greatest measure as their term. It is like the subtle principle of the empty *Dao*, which is originally nameless; by its function, we forcibly name it the *Dao*, yet the name falls short of the principle.

Thus, heaven and earth are the greatest of forms; yin and yang are the greatest of *qi*; the *Dao* is their commonality.

**[Annotation]** Things are made to flow freely; what flows freely through things is without partiality, and so we forcibly call it the *Dao*.

**[Annotation]** Heaven covers and earth bears; yin and yang engender and nurture—thus, they are the greatest among forms and *qi*. The *Dao* of heaven can flow through the ten thousand things, sustaining and nourishing all life, bestowing transformation without partiality—thus, it is called the common.

To name and refer to it by its greatness is permissible,

**[Annotation]** What is called the *Dao* that can be spoken of.

**[Annotation]** The great *Dao* flows through things, giving life and transforming the myriad beings. Speaking of its origin, it is truly nameless; by its function, naming it is permissible.

but once it has a name, can it still be compared? Once a name exists, how can it be likened to what is nameless?

**[Annotation]** The name already exists—how then can it be compared to what admits no comparison?

**[Annotation]** By its function, the name *Dao* already exists; one cannot compare this named thing to the principle of the nameless. In such comparison, the distance grows vast.

Thus, to debate it in this way is like comparing dogs and horses—it falls far short.

**[Annotation]** The debate of names does not reach far; thus, the *Dao* is still deemed insufficient. It must reside in the realm of the nameless and wordless to attain it. Though it has a name, nothing can compare to it.

**[Annotation]** To compare it solely to a single beast like a dog or horse is not only to differ in size but also to distinguish in worth. Now, to compare the named *Dao* to the nameless principle is not only to differ in refinement and coarseness but also to diverge in depth—thus, it falls far short.

Lesser Knowledge said: Within the four directions, encompassing the six directions, from whence do the ten thousand things arise?

**[Annotation]** This question implies that the *Dao* is capable of generating them.

**[Annotation]** Within the six directions, between heaven and earth, from where do the myriad beings—both moving and still—arise? Lesser Knowledge raises this question to discern their origin.

Grand Duke Diao said: Yin and yang illuminate and cover each other, govern each other; the four seasons replace, engender, and destroy each other.

**[Annotation]** All this occurs of itself, not from nothing.

**[Annotation]** The three luminaries illuminate one another, the two forces cover each other, wind and rain govern each other, heat and cold replace each other, spring and summer engender, autumn and winter destroy—how does this relate to intention? It is the natural principle of things.

Desire and aversion, approach and withdrawal arise from this; the union of female and male is ever thus.

**[Annotation]** All these affairs—movement and rest, advance and retreat—ultimately arise from the mutual illumination of yin and yang and the replacement of the four seasons.

**[Annotation]** *Arise* describes the emergence. *Ever* means constant. When things are favorable, they approach with desire; when adverse, they withdraw with aversion. Beings within the transformations of yin and yang harbor such intentions, opening and closing, uniting and parting—this is their constant way.

Safety and danger alternate, fortune and misfortune engender each other, urgency and ease rub against each other, gathering and scattering complete the process.

**[Annotation]** When encountering prosperity, there is safety; when meeting adversity, there is danger. Danger becomes misfortune, safety becomes fortune. Ease brings longevity, urgency brings early death. Scattering leads to death, gathering leads to life. All these outcomes arise from the mutual friction of creation—like the four seasons changing and transforming, how do they relate to intention?

These are the names and realities that can be recorded, the essences that can be noted.

**[Annotation]** Beyond this lies the natural. As for the causes of the natural, who knows their origin?

**[Annotation]** *Noted* means recorded. Within yin and yang, between heaven and earth, there are realities and names—thus, they can be outlined and recorded. Even if subtle, they can still be spoken of and noted. But when it comes to the profound and wondrous principle, transcending form and name, it cannot be sought through words or images.

Following the sequence of their mutual ordering, the arising of their mutual employment, exhaustion returns to the beginning, the end returns to the start. These are the properties of things.

**[Annotation]** All are the properties of things, occurring naturally—not that anything is capable of making them so.

**[Annotation]** The four seasons cycle, mutually ordering one another; the five phases move, driving one another in turn. When things reach their limit, they return; when they end, they begin anew. The properties of things are exhausted in this.

What words can express, what knowledge can reach, extends only to the limits of things.

**[Annotation]** Beyond things, nothing more exists—thus, words and knowledge do not surpass the limits of things.

**[Annotation]** The true principle is profound and wondrous, beyond words and knowledge.

If one relies on verbal explanation, employs knowledge, or engages in thought, the Dao may be exhausted only in the realm of existing things, yet it fundamentally cannot reach the boundless and profound境. Those who perceive the Dao do not follow what ceases nor trace what arises.

**[Annotation]** Arising and ceasing occur of themselves—nothing is to be traced or followed.

This is where discussion must halt.

**[Annotation]** Since all is self-so, there is nothing left to discuss.

**[Annotation]** *睹* means "to see." *随* means "to pursue." Those who perceive the Dao—persons of profound awakening—concentrate their spirit beyond things, silently illuminating the center of all. They embody the ten thousand conditions as boundless, the four kinds of life as non-existent. How could they cling to things or trace the origins of arising and ceasing? This is what is meant by "words fail at the Dao" and "discussion comes to rest."

The Lesser Knower said: Jizhen’s "non-action" and Jiezi’s "occasional agency"—which of these two doctrines aligns with true nature, and which is partial in its principle?

**[Annotation]** Jizhen said: "The Dao does nothing." Jiezi said: "The Dao occasionally acts." "Occasional agency" means it has the power to move things.

**[Annotation]** Jizhen and Jiezi were both worthy men of Qi who frequented the Jixia Academy. The passage invokes these two worthies to clarify the principle. *莫* means "none." *使* means "to act." Jizhen took non-action as the Dao, while Jiezi held that the Dao has the power to act upon things. Each adhered to one side, neither offering a comprehensive account. The Lesser Knower now raises this question to determine which is correct or flawed in relation to pure nature and the wondrous principle.

Taigong Tiao said: The crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs are what people know. Yet even one of great knowledge cannot describe in words how they transform of themselves, nor can they anticipate in thought what they will do next.

**[Annotation]** Things have their own nature—this is not something agency can achieve.

From this perspective, Jizhen’s words are correct.

**[Annotation]** What the eye sees and the ear hears—roosters crowing and dogs barking—arise from the transformations of creation, known equally by the foolish and the wise. Thus, even the greatest sages and most profound knowers cannot fathom in thought what they do, nor can they describe in words how they come to be. Their crowing and barking occur naturally—how could the Dao have made them so? Knowing this, Jiezi’s words do not accord with principle.

Analyzing this further: refinement reaches the point of having no peer, and greatness reaches the point of being unencompassable.

**[Annotation]** All occur not through agency but of themselves.

**[Annotation]** Even if one takes the most refined things—those without pattern or order—and the coarsest things—those too vast to measure—and analyzes them through this principle, not a single phenomenon fails to be a spontaneous transformation.

"Occasional agency" and "non-action" remain bound to things and ultimately become errors.

**[Annotation]** Things have their mutual agency, yet all occur of themselves. Thus, "non-action" is not separate from things.

All things, in their manifold forms, pass away through non-action.

**[Annotation]** Not aligning with the Dao, they remain bound to things; clinging to one side, they ultimately become afflictions.

"Occasional agency" is substantive.

**[Annotation]** It acts of itself.

**[Annotation]** It clings to action.

"Non-action" is empty.

**[Annotation]** It does not act.

**[Annotation]** It is submerged in nothingness.

Having name and reality is where things reside.

**[Annotation]** This refers to the locus of name and reality.

Having no name and no reality is the emptiness within things.

**[Annotation]** Where things reside, their reality is utterly empty.

**[Annotation]** If one’s nature clings to existence, then wherever one is becomes a thing. If one’s nature embraces nothingness, then wherever one is becomes emptiness. Thus, existence and nothingness lie in the mind, not in the external world.

What can be spoken or conceived—speaking of it only increases its distance.

**[Annotation]** Therefore, one must seek it beyond words and thoughts to reach it.

**[Annotation]** What can be explained in words or grasped in thought grows ever more distant from the Dao. Thus, one must seek it beyond words and thoughts to reach it.

What has not yet arisen cannot be prevented.

**[Annotation]** It arises suddenly of itself—control does not lie with me, and I cannot forbid it.

What has already died cannot be obstructed.

**[Annotation]** It dies suddenly of itself—I cannot oppose it.

**[Annotation]** *忌* means "to forbid." *阻* means "to hinder." It arises suddenly—one cannot forbid it. It dies suddenly—what obstruction can there be? One should simply follow change and yield to transformation, finding peace wherever one is. *阻* may also be written as *沮*, meaning "resentment." Dying in accord with the natural order, one does not resent loss.

Death and life are not distant—their principle cannot be seen.

**[Annotation]** They are near, within the body, yet one cannot see their self-so nature and thus desires to grieve over them.

**[Annotation]** The gathering and dispersal of toil and rest occur within a single body. Their principle is obscure and dark—foolish people do not see it.

"Occasional agency" and "non-action" are the assumptions of doubt.

**[Annotation]** These two are what the world most doubts.

**[Annotation]** The dual attachments to existence and nothingness do not reside in the minds of those who have attained. Only those of doubtful nature, clinging to one side, engage in such discussions.

Observing its root, its going has no end. Seeking its end, its coming has no limit. Without end and without limit—words are exhausted, yet it shares the same principle as things.

**[Annotation]** The principle of things is boundless; thus, knowing that words are boundless, one then shares the same principle as things.

**[Annotation]** The root is the past. The end is the future. The past has gone, and transformations are endless—one cannot fathom their origin or grasp them in thought. Even if one were to expound at length on nothingness, clinging to one side, one would remain bound to things. Thus, it shares the same principle as things.

"Occasional agency" and "non-action" are the root of words, and they share the same beginning and end as things.

**[Annotation]** It is always non-action that makes things act of themselves.

**[Annotation]** *本* means "beginning." Those who cling to one side as the root remain bound to beginnings and ends, sharing the same start as things. Thus, they depart from things.

The Dao cannot be possessed as "having," nor can "having" be devoid of it.

**[Annotation]** The Dao cannot make things "have," yet what has existence is always self-so.

**[Annotation]** The supreme Dao is unceasing, neither having nor lacking. Thus, to cling to either "having" or "lacking" is equally inadmissible.

The name "Dao" is a borrowed term for its functioning.

**[Annotation]** It is that by which things proceed, hence the borrowed name "Dao."

**[Annotation]** The Dao is vast and nameless; "Dao" is a forced designation. This borrowed name and teaching are set in motion to enact it.

"Occasional agency" and "non-action" are but one corner of things—how could they suffice for the great Dao?

**[Annotation]** From one corner, the rest may be inferred.

**[Annotation]** *Hu* means "how." *Fang* means "Dao." "Occasional agency" and "non-action" have not yet ascended to the realm of emptiness and subtlety; they remain but one thing among the vulgar, a partial and biased view. How could such a person attain the profound mystery or speak of the great Dao?

If words sufficed, then speaking all day would exhaust the Dao.

**[Annotation]** To seek the Dao beyond words and meaning is sufficient.

If words did not suffice, then speaking all day would exhaust only things.

**[Annotation]** To be unable to forget words and preserve meaning is insufficient.

**[Annotation]** *Zu* means "complete and all-pervading." *Buzu* means "partial and obstructed." If one can forget words and grasp the principle, then speech is as though unspoken, fully aligning with the mysterious Dao. But if one clings to words without fathoming the principle, one strays from the Dao of emptiness and penetration, exhausting only obstructed things.

The Dao is the ultimate of things; neither speech nor silence can bear its weight.

**[Annotation]** The Dao of heaven is the ultimate of things, always self-so without agency, neither in speech nor in silence.

**[Annotation]** At the ultimate of Dao and things, it is neither Dao nor thing; thus, neither speech nor silence can fully bear it.

Beyond speech, beyond silence—discourse has its limits.

**[Annotation]** Its limit lies in self-so, not in speech or silence to discuss it.

**[Annotation]** Silence is not silence; discourse is not discourse. Only by seeking beyond the four propositions can one enter the gate of manifold mysteries.

**Miscellaneous Chapters: External Things, Twenty-Six**

External things cannot be made certain.
**[Commentary]** Those who fix their minds with obstinacy deem things certain.
Human affairs and external things are tangled in myriad threads; only by abiding in the great compliance can one achieve emptiness and penetration wherever one goes. If one opposes things with clinging attachment, one will inevitably encounter calamity.
Thus, Long Feng was executed, Bi Gan was slain, Jizi feigned madness, Elai perished, and Jie and Zhou met their ruin.
**[Annotation]** Both good and evil in their governance cannot be made certain.
**[Commentary]** Long Feng and Bi Gan have already been explained in the *Outer Chapters*.
Jizi was the younger uncle of King Zhou of Yin. When his loyal remonstrance went unheeded, he feared Zhou’s harm and feigned madness, yet in the end, he could not escape execution.
Elai was Zhou’s sycophantic minister, who devoted himself entirely to Zhou and thus perished with him.
No ruler fails to desire loyalty from their ministers, yet loyalty is not necessarily trusted. Thus, Wu Yun was cast into the river, and Chang Hong died in Shu, his blood preserved for three years before transforming into jade.
**[Annotation]** The utmost of sincerity.
**[Commentary]** Jade is a precious stone.
Zixu and Chang Hong have already been expounded in the *Outer Chapters*.
As for being "cast into the river," Wu Yun remonstrated with Fuchai, who killed him, flayed his skin to make a bag shaped like an owl, filled it with Zixu’s corpse, and set it afloat on the river—hence, "cast into the river."
Chang Hong, slandered and exiled to Shu, resented his loyalty being met with slander, so he disemboweled himself and died. The people of Shu, moved by his devotion, preserved his blood in a casket, and after three years, it transformed into jade—a testament to the utmost of sincerity.
No parent fails to desire filial piety from their children, yet filial piety is not necessarily cherished. Thus, Xiaoji grieved, and Zeng Shen sorrowed.
**[Annotation]** Therefore, the perfected person responds to things without preconceived intent, adapting only to what is fitting.
**[Commentary]** Xiaoji was the son of Gaozong of Yin. He suffered at the hands of his stepmother and died of sorrow.
Zeng Shen was supremely filial, yet his parents despised him, often beating him nearly to death—hence his weeping.
The bond between parent and child is of heavenly nature, and the duty between ruler and minister is of grave weight. Yet even the utmost loyalty and filial piety may not be loved or understood—how much less can the myriad paths of worldly affairs be made certain?
One should only hold loyalty in the heart, harmonizing self and other, to preserve the body and distance oneself from harm.

When wood rubs against wood, it ignites; when metal is kept near fire, it melts.
**[Commentary]** Wood generates fire, and fire overcomes metal—this is the natural principle of the five phases. Thus, when wood is rubbed against wood, fire is born; when metal is guarded by fire, it melts. Therefore, those who cling obstinately to external things with sincere fixation will meet with the ruin of melting away.
When yin and yang move in disorder, heaven and earth are greatly shaken. Then there are thunder and lightning, fire within water, and the great locust tree is burned.
**[Annotation]** This is what is meant by "moving in disorder."
**[Commentary]** Fire within water is lightning. The burning of the great locust tree is the strike of thunderbolts. When yin and yang are in chaos, defying the five phases, thunder and lightning erupt in fury, startling the myriad things. When people deviate from harmonious qi, their ruin follows likewise.

Excessive sorrow traps one in a double predicament with no escape.
**[Annotation]** If one cannot forget form, one will be ensnared by joy and sorrow wherever form leads, with no fitting course left or right.
**[Commentary]** Unable to empty the mind and forget form, one’s heart becomes obstinate and fixed. Thus, one’s emotions race between the two realms of honor and disgrace, sinking into the dual snares of sorrow and joy, with no refuge from form.

The *chen* and *dun* cannot be completed.
**[Annotation]** The more one clings, the greater the difficulty in every situation, and one knows not where to stand—hence, they cannot be completed.
**[Commentary]** *Chen* and *dun* mean trepidation. Unable to forget emotions and relinquish attachment, one exhausts the body with anxiety and care, yet ultimately achieves nothing.

If the heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth,
**[Annotation]** What it aspires to is lofty and vast.
**[Commentary]** When the heart pursues worldly affairs, it becomes lofty and distant, racing after things and traversing the cosmos.
It is restless and sunk in gloom,
**[Annotation]** Not level, peaceful, and smooth.
**[Commentary]** When desires are fulfilled, one is consoled; when they are thwarted, one is benighted and oppressed. Encountering circumstances, one sinks into them; touching things, one is obstructed. Since this is not clarity and peace, how can it be level and smooth?

When profit and harm grind against each other, they generate abundant fire.
**[Annotation]** This is due to internal heat.
**[Commentary]** Where there is profit, there is harm—like the cicada and the magpie. Entangled between profit and harm, the heart within is constantly heated, generating fire in abundance.
The harmony of the multitude is burned.
**[Annotation]** When the multitude forgets profit, there is harmony; if profit and harm linger in the heart, their harmony is burned.
**[Commentary]** *Burned* means scorched. The multitude refers to the common people, who cannot abide in their allotted place without action but instead race after profit and harm. Their internal heat is like fire, scorching the flame of their harmonious nature.
The moon is surely no match for fire.
**[Annotation]** What is great and dim is burdened by many encumbrances; what is small and bright knows its place.

**[Commentary]** Though the moon is vast and its light full, though fire is small it shines brightly. This illustrates how one with grand ambitions and many desires is not equal to one who humbly guards their allotted place. Thus there comes a state of *tuìrán* where the Dao is exhausted.

**[Annotation]** Only in *tuìrán*—free from self-importance, forgetting the body and attaining self-mastery—does the Dao reach its fullness.

**[Commentary]** *Tuìrán* describes a bearing of ease and unconcern. When one forgets profit and harm, remains indifferent and unassuming, the profound principles of the Dao are fully realized in this.

Zhuang Zhou, being poor, went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River.

**[Commentary]** The Marquis of the River was Duke Wen of Wei. Zhuangzi, lofty and pure, did not engage in worldly affairs, and as his family was impoverished, he came to borrow grain. The Marquis said, "Very well. When I receive the taxes from my fief, I will lend you three hundred pieces of gold—will that suffice?"

**[Commentary]** *Nuò* means assent. Copper and iron were also called *jin*; this was not gold. He would wait until year’s end, when he collected the people’s taxes and the tribute from his fief, before lending it.

Zhuang Zhou, his face flushed with anger, replied, "On my way here yesterday, I heard someone calling from the road. I looked and saw a carp in the rut of a wagon wheel. I asked it, ‘Carp, what are you doing here?’ It answered, ‘I am a wave-minister of the Eastern Sea. Might you have a dou or sheng of water to keep me alive?’"

**[Commentary]** A wave-minister, a small servant of the tides, trapped in a wheel rut—could you spare some water to save me?

"I said, ‘Very well. I am about to travel south to persuade the kings of Wu and Yue to dam the Western River and bring its waters to meet you—will that do?’"

**[Commentary]** The Western River is the Shu River. Though many rivers flow north, only the Shu River comes from the west, hence it is called the Western River.

The carp, its face flushed with anger, replied, "I have lost my usual element and have nowhere to dwell. A dou or sheng of water would suffice to keep me alive, yet you speak of this! You would do better to seek me now in the market of dried fish."

**[Annotation]** This shows that what accords with principle need not be grand; if it does not, even the grand is of no use.

**[Commentary]** *Suǒ* means to seek; *sì* means market. A carp accustomed to the sea, now deprived of its usual home, could be saved by a mere dou or sheng of water—yet you speak of damming the Western River, which is no help at all. If you cannot save me even for a moment, you might as well find me in the dried-fish market. This illustrates that matters, great or small, depend on timeliness and appropriateness; if they do not meet the moment, even the grand is of no use.

Lord Ren of Ren made a great hook with a thick black rope, using fifty castrated oxen as bait.

**[Commentary]** Ren was the name of a state; this was a lord of Ren. *Jù* means great; *zī* means black rope; *jiè* means castrated ox; *ěr* means the meat on a hook. Having made a great hook, he used a thick rope and hung fifty oxen as bait.

He squatted on Mount Kuaiji and cast his line into the Eastern Sea.

**[Commentary]** Though he made a great hook, a year passed without catching a fish. *Dūn* means to crouch; *jù* means to sit, perched on the mountain. He fished day after day, yet after a year had caught nothing. Then a great fish took the bait, dragging the huge hook down, plunging deep and thrashing its fins, raising waves like mountains. The sea churned violently, its roar matching that of ghosts and spirits, its dreadful power extending a thousand *li*.

**[Commentary]** After a year, a great fish swallowed the hook. It pulled the hook down, plunging in alarm, thrashing its head and tail, flaring its scales and fins, raising white waves like mountains, vast enough to touch the sun.

Lord Ren caught this fish, cut it into strips, and dried it. From the Zhe River eastward and from Cangwu northward, there was none who did not feast on this fish.

**[Commentary]** This fish was a sea spirit. The Zhe is the Zhe River. Cangwu is a mountain in the far south, where Shun was buried. The sea spirit’s flesh was abundant, and when dried into jerky, it fed all from the Five Ridges northward and the Three Xiang eastward.

Yet later, those of shallow talent and glib speech were all astonished and spread the news.

**[Commentary]** In the declining years of the age, those with frivolous minds and shallow learning, who recited words without embracing the profound Dao, heard of the great fish and were amazed, telling one another. Some texts write *quǎn* (shallow) as *quán* (measured). *Quán* means limited.

For one who lifts a slender pole and hurries to irrigation ditches, guarding minnows and carp, catching a great fish is difficult indeed.

**[Commentary]** *Lěi* means a thin rope; *ní* and *fù* are small fish. Carrying a slender pole and hurrying to irrigation channels, one may catch minnows and carp, but catching a great fish is difficult.

For one who adorns trivial words to seek lofty office, attaining great understanding is also far off.

**[Commentary]** *Gān* means to seek; *xiàn* means high. Those who cultivate minor conduct and pride themselves on their words, seeking high reputation and fame, will never fully grasp the supreme Dao. Some texts write *xiàn* (high) without the heart radical, as the ancient character for *xuán* (suspended) often omitted it.

Thus, those who have never heard of the customs of the Ren clan cannot govern the world, for they are far from it.

**[Annotation]** This shows that as aspirations differ, so too do the means of governing the world—great and small each have their proper place.

**[Commentary]** The ways of the human world are ever-changing, now level, now perilous. Without a mind vast and empty, one cannot navigate order and chaos. Those who pride themselves on reputation and adorn their conduct are far from it.

The Confucians used *Odes* and *Rites* to rob graves. A great Confucian announced, "The east is stirring—how goes the matter?"

**[Commentary]** A great Confucian, a learned scholar, refers to a senior academician. *Lú* means to transmit words from above to below; *chuán* means to pass on. "The east is stirring" means dawn is breaking, urging them to rise. The Confucian disciples, robbing graves as thieves, feared the coming light and hurriedly asked how the matter was proceeding.

A lesser Confucian replied, "The skirt and jacket are not yet untied—there is a pearl in the mouth."

The lesser Confucian was a disciple. The dead man’s skirt and jacket had not yet been untied; feeling inside his mouth, they knew there was a precious pearl. The *Odes* indeed contains this verse: “The green, green wheat grows on the hillside slope. While living, he gave no alms—why part with the pearl in death?” **[Commentary]** This is a lost poem, long since excised. Noblemen were often buried with pearls in their mouths, so the verse “The green, green wheat” was recited to mock them. Seizing his temples, pressing his cheeks, the Confucians used a metal mallet to strike his jaw, carefully prying apart his cheeks to avoid damaging the pearl within.

**[Annotation]** *Odes* and *Rites* are the vestiges of the former kings. If the person is unworthy, the Dao cannot operate in vain. Thus, even Confucians may use them for villainy, proving that vestiges cannot be relied upon.

**[Commentary]** *Jiē* means to grasp; *yè* means to press; *huì* means the mouth; *kòng* means to strike. Grasping his temples and striking his mouth with an iron mallet, they feared harming the pearl, so they gently separated his cheeks. Thus, Tian Heng exploited benevolence and righteousness to usurp power, while the Confucian scholars recited *Odes* and *Rites* to rob graves. From this, we see that the sagely vestiges cannot be trusted.

The disciple of Lao Laizi went out to gather firewood and encountered Confucius. Returning, he reported to his master, **[Commentary]** Lao Laizi was a worthy recluse of Chu, who often lived in seclusion on Mount Meng. The King of Chu, knowing his worth, sent envoys to summon him as minister. His wife, returning from gathering firewood, saw carriage tracks before their door. Asking the reason, Lao Laizi said, “The King of Chu has summoned me as minister.” His wife replied, “Those who accept from others must be controlled by them. You cannot control others.” She then left him. Lao Laizi followed, carrying his wife on his back, and fled south of the Yangtze, where none knew their whereabouts. The one who went out for firewood was gathering kindling. After seeing Confucius, he returned to inform his master.

**[Commentary]** “There is a man over there, tall above and short below, his shoulders hunched and his ears set back, his gaze as if managing the Four Seas. I do not know whose son he is.” **[Annotation]** Tall above and short below. His ears were set back and sloped upward. His gaze was vacant, as if managing others’ affairs.

**[Commentary]** *Xiū* means tall; *qū* means short; *mò* means the shoulders. The man he saw was tall above and short below, his shoulders hunched, his ears set back, his gaze lofty and distant, his demeanor hurried, as if managing the world. Unsure of his lineage, the disciple asked out of curiosity.

Lao Laizi said, “That is Qiu. Summon him.” **[Commentary]** Qiu is Kong Qiu of Lu; you should call him here.

Confucius arrived. Lao Laizi said, “Qiu, discard your bodily pride and your cultivated wisdom—only then can you be a gentleman.” **[Annotation]** This means Confucius could abandon form and forsake knowledge, thus becoming a gentleman.

**[Commentary]** *Gōng* means the body. When Confucius arrived, Lao Laizi spoke first, urging him to cast off bodily adornment and forget cultivated wisdom—only then could he be a gentleman.

Confucius bowed and withdrew, **[Annotation]** accepting his words.

**[Commentary]** Respectfully receiving his teaching, he bowed and retreated. With a startled expression, he changed his countenance and asked, “Can my work be advanced?” **[Annotation]** He posed the question to make Lao Laizi clarify that it could not be advanced.

**[Commentary]** *Cùrán* means a startled appearance. Confucius asked whether the work of sagely vestiges and conduct could be cultivated and put to use in the world.

Lao Laizi said, “To spare the harm of one age but alarm the calamities of ten thousand ages—**[Annotation]** If one acts for one age, the vestiges will bring calamity for ten thousand ages, so it cannot be taken lightly.

**[Commentary]** Sagely wisdom and benevolence save the harm of one age, but when later generations grasp them for villainy, they become the disasters of ten thousand ages. Those who arrogantly rely on sagely vestiges are like Tian Heng. Some interpret *jīng* as “to cause,” meaning to make later generations ceaselessly pursue them—also implying the meaning of relentless striving—if you stubbornly cling to poverty and lowliness, **[Commentary]** Stubbornly adhering to sagely vestiges, manipulating them at will, and straying from one’s original nature leads to poverty and distress. Have you lost your strategy and fallen short? **[Annotation]** If one simply follows them, the people’s nature will not be violated, and there will be no affairs beyond their reach.

**[Commentary]** Losing one’s original nature and neglecting the boundaries of life, one falls short of the true Dao. Kindness that delights in arrogance is a lifelong disgrace. **[Annotation]** Those who are kind and delighted are unkind when not delighted. Yet kindness cannot last forever, so a single act of kindness becomes a lifelong disgrace.

**[Commentary]** Those who take delight in kindness cannot extend it universally, so arrogance and disdain abound. Thus, using kindness to win people only breeds resentment, resulting in lifelong disgrace. The conduct of the common people may be advanced, **[Annotation]** If it is easy to advance, one must not forget kindness.

They attract one another with fame and bind one another with concealment. **[Annotation]** *Yǐn* means to gather; this refers to advancement.

**[Commentary]** The natures of the supremely wise and the utterly foolish are difficult to change, but the common people are easily swayed. Thus, hearing of Yao’s virtue, they are drawn by fame; hearing of Jie’s evil, they conceal themselves in hiding. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to forget both and close off what you praise. **[Annotation]** To close is to block.

**[Commentary]** Praising Yao’s good Dao and condemning Jie’s evil conduct leads to ceaseless striving. Losing one’s nature is common, so it is better to forget both good and evil, block praise and blame, and preserve the nature of things. To turn back is to invite harm; to act is to invite deviation. **[Annotation]** Following it preserves wholeness; stillness preserves correctness.

**[Commentary]** Turning against the nature of things brings only harm; disturbing the mind leads only to deviation.

The sage proceeds with deliberation to initiate affairs, thereby ensuring success in every endeavor.
**[Annotation]** Affairs do not stray from their root, thus his achievements are ever accomplished.
**[Commentary]** With unhurried composure, the sage acts without premeditation, responding to the moment to undertake his work. Ever at ease, never opposing the nature of things, his success is ever assured.

Why then does he bear it to the end with such self-importance?
**[Annotation]** Self-importance cannot be borne, thus he abandons it and does not claim it.
**[Commentary]** *Naihe*—how could it be? How could one cling to the traces of benevolence and righteousness, disturbing the minds of all things, carrying the burden of solemn dignity to the end of one’s days? These are the words with which Lao Lai reproved Confucius.

In the dead of night, the Lord of Song Yuan dreamed of a man with disheveled hair peering through the side gate.
**[Commentary]** The Lord of Song, posthumously titled Yuan, was the ruler of Song. *A* refers to a curved or side chamber, meaning the gate of a side or curved room.
The man said: "I come from Zailu Deep. I was sent by the Clear River as an emissary to the River Lord, when the fisherman Yu Ju caught me."
**[Commentary]** *Zi* means "from." Zailu is the name of a deep pool by the river. His surname was Yu, his given name Ju, and he was a fisherman.
The Lord Yuan awoke and had the dream interpreted. The diviner said: "This is a spirit turtle."
The Lord said: "Is there a fisherman named Yu Ju?"
His attendants replied: "There is."
The Lord said: "Summon Yu Ju to court."
**[Commentary]** *Ming* means "to summon." He ordered Yu Ju to attend court to inquire about his catch.
The next day, Yu Ju appeared at court.

The Lord said: "What did you catch in your fishing?"
Yu Ju replied: "In my net, I caught a white turtle, five feet in circumference."
The Lord said: "Present this turtle to me."
When the turtle arrived, the Lord wavered twice—first wishing to kill it, then wishing to spare it. His mind uncertain, he divined with it, and the oracle said: "Killing the turtle for divination will bring good fortune."
**[Commentary]** *Uncertainty lingered in his heart; whether to kill or spare it, he hesitated again and again. Only after determining that killing it would be auspicious did he proceed to carve the turtle for divination.*

He then carved the turtle, drilling seventy-two times without a single miscalculation.
**[Commentary]** *From beginning to end, he drilled seventy-two times, and in every instance, his calculations of fortune and misfortune were never amiss.*

Confucius said: "The spirit turtle could appear in a dream to Lord Yuan, yet could not evade Yu Ju’s net. It could foresee seventy-two divinations without error, yet could not escape the disaster of having its entrails carved out. Thus, knowledge has its limitations, and even the divine has its insufficiencies."
**[Annotation]** *Such is the insufficiency of divine knowledge. Only those who dwell in stillness, abiding in what they can do without seeking beyond, remain whole.*
**[Commentary]** *Divine wisdom is not to be relied upon. Therefore, the perfected person in the world forgets form and spirit, intellect and thought, becoming like a withered tree in its barrenness, equal to the dead in its stillness. Entrusting all things to the workings of creation, even the great sage Confucius thus reflected upon it.*

*Though one possesses supreme knowledge, a multitude of counselors surpasses it.*
**[Annotation]** *Do not rely on one’s own knowledge but employ the counsel of many.*
*Fish do not fear nets but fear pelicans.*
**[Annotation]** *Nets are without intent, and thus they catch fish.*
**[Commentary]** *Nets, being without intent, catch fish—this illustrates how the sage, being without partiality, gathers the world to himself.*

*Discard petty knowledge, and great knowledge becomes clear.*
**[Annotation]** *Petty knowledge is self-serving; great knowledge responds to things.*
**[Commentary]** *Petty knowledge clings to preferences in the mind; great knowledge is without distinction. Abandoning the emotions of separation and contention, one attains impartiality, and thus great knowledge shines forth.*

*Discard goodness, and one becomes naturally good.*
**[Annotation]** *Discard goodness, and there is nothing to admire in goodness. With nothing to admire, goodness arises spontaneously without artifice.*
**[Commentary]** *Abandoning the petty heart of self-importance and merging with the great goodness of nature, as the earlier text says: "Departing from the Way to pursue goodness is perilous; acting with virtue is treacherous." The *Laozi* also states: "When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness has already arisen."*

*An infant is born without a teacher yet learns to speak, for it dwells among those who can speak.*
**[Annotation]** *Naturally and without practice, it acquires this ability—not by striving to imitate others.*
**[Commentary]** *The nature of an infant does not depend on teachers or craftsmen. As it gradually grows, it naturally learns to speak—not through deliberate study, but by dwelling among its parents, following its innate nature, and speaking spontaneously. Thus, we know that the myriad things in the world do not arise from acquired knowledge or learned skill.*

Hui Shi said to Zhuangzi: "Your words are useless."
**[Commentary]** *Zhuangzi was a man of comprehensive understanding. His vision embraced both emptiness and fullness, and his words were vast and profound. Yet they did not align with the common mind, so Hui Shi mocked them as useless.*

Zhuangzi said: "Only when one understands the useless can one begin to speak of the useful."
**[Commentary]** *What is useful is like a prematurely severed life; what is useless preserves its wholeness. Thus, only when one understands the useless can one discuss the useful.*

"The earth is neither narrow nor small, yet what man uses is only enough to stand upon. If, however, one were to dig away the earth beside one’s feet down to the Yellow Springs, would it still be of use?"
Hui Shi said: "It would be useless."
**[Commentary]** *To dig away. Within the six directions, nothing is vaster than the earth, yet what man uses is no more than the space to stand. If, beyond the space for one’s feet, one were to dig down to the Yellow Springs, one would tremble and be unable to move. Thus, we know that what is useful depends on what is useless for its success.*

Zhuangzi said: "Then the usefulness of the useless is indeed clear."
**[Annotation]** *The sage responds from within, acting in accord with the moment; what is expressed outwardly flows from the unfolding of circumstances. When circumstances unfold, affairs are resolved; when the outer is clear, the inner is employed—such is the principle of mutual necessity.*
**[Commentary]** *If one stands only where one’s feet fit, one cannot walk. Only with additional space can one move and use one’s feet. The principle of the useless is thus made clear, as the *Laozi* says: "Existence is the means of advantage; non-existence is the means of use."*

Zhuangzi said: "If a man is capable of wandering, how could he not wander? If a man is incapable of wandering, how could he wander?"
**[Annotation]** *What one’s nature is capable of, one cannot but do; what one’s nature is incapable of, one cannot force. Thus, the sage does not impose restrictions, and all things attain their proper place without knowing how they do so.*
**[Commentary]** *People are endowed with different natures and employ them in different ways. Some respond to words like an echo; others cannot distinguish beans from wheat. Thus, what one’s nature is capable of, one cannot but follow; what it is incapable of, one cannot force. Each abides by its portion, and nothing is lost. But those who indulge in aimless wandering or cling to resolute detachment—alas! Are these the tasks of one of utmost knowledge and profound virtue?*

**[Annotation]** *Without utmost depth, none can bear such aspirations or trust in such extraordinary abilities.*
**[Commentary]** *To drift and flee without return, to be resolute and unyielding—these are the ways of the utmost foolishness and baseness. How could they be the tasks of one of perfect wisdom and deep virtue? This is Zhuangzi’s meaning.*

*To fall and not recover, to rush like fire and not look back—*
**[Annotation]** *What people desire, they pursue without regard for right or wrong, even unto death.*
**[Commentary]** *The deluded and ignorant cling stubbornly to their ways. Though their homes be destroyed and their bodies ruined, they do not turn back. Chasing after things with the urgency of fire, they do not look back. Such is the result of aimless wandering and resolute detachment."*

Though they may serve as ruler and minister to one another, this is but a matter of the times; when the age changes, they need not hold one another in contempt.
**[Annotation]** This is the great equality and sameness.
**[Commentary]** Those favored by the times become rulers, while those whose talents do not match the age become ministers—like Shun and Yu, who in turn served as ruler and minister. Thus, when the world undergoes transformation, one cannot despise the other for being ruler or minister. Those who drift and flee know nothing of this. Hence it is said: *The perfected person does not cling to conduct.*
**[Annotation]** They follow whatever they encounter, thus moving with transformation.
**[Commentary]** As the world rises and falls, they move accordingly, and so the enlightened never stagnate. To honor the past and disparage the present is the way of scholars.
**[Annotation]** The past is not inherently noble, nor the present inherently base; yet scholars honor the past and disparage the present, losing sight of the source.
**[Commentary]** The customs of each age differ, as do the purity and decadence of their times. The affairs of past and present are not the same, yet to value the past and demean the present is to stray far from true discernment—merely a narrow view of learning, not the clarity of understanding. If we observe the present age through the lens of the rulers of old, such as the sovereigns before the Three August Ones, who could avoid being swept away?
**[Annotation]** To follow the times and adapt to things is to achieve perfect harmony.
**[Commentary]** If we govern the present with the ways of the distant past, the contrast between purity and decadence will be stark—who could avoid being tossed about and losing their nature? This is the flaw of honoring the past and disparaging the present. Only the perfected person can wander through the world without bias,
**[Annotation]** Responding to affairs as they arise, wherever they may be, is correctness.
and follow others without losing themselves.
**[Annotation]** Fundamentally, there is no self—what is there to lose?
They do not study teachings,
**[Annotation]** Teachings arise from the nature of things, hence they are not learned.
nor do they adhere to intent.
**[Annotation]** Intent arises naturally, so to follow and employ it is to allow all things to fulfill their own nature.
**[Commentary]** Only those of utmost virtue can adapt to the times and transform with things, not through learned intention but through the fullness of their inherent nature. As for "not adhering to intent," it means embracing the intent of teachings to guide their nature, yet their true Way is originally complete and does not rely on those teachings.

The eye that penetrates is called clarity; the ear that penetrates is called acuity; the nose that penetrates is called discernment of scents; the mouth that penetrates is called savor; the mind that penetrates is called understanding; understanding that penetrates is called virtue.
**[Commentary]** *Penetrates* means to be unobstructed. *Discernment of scents* refers to pungent and foul odors. When the six senses are free of blockage, their clarity and acuity are not swayed by externals, thus becoming virtue.

The Way does not favor obstruction; obstruction leads to choking, and choking, if unchecked, leads to trampling.
**[Annotation]** When what should flow is blocked, principles cannot be released and instead trample one another.
Then harm arises in abundance.
**[Annotation]** *Arises* means to emerge.

All things with awareness rely on breath,
**[Annotation]** Those with roots and life lack awareness and do not rely on breath.
**[Commentary]** Heaven endows the six senses, and none can be dispensed with. The ear hears, the eye sees, the nose smells, the mind knows—these are their proper functions, and though employed, they incur no fault. Yet if the eye is drawn to the allure of mulberry groves, the ear to the lewd sounds of Pu, the nose to the excess of orchid and musk, or the mind to boundless desires, then Heaven’s principle is extinguished—how can this be called penetration? Thus, when the six senses are thoroughly unobstructed, the breath flows freely, and the principle of life is preserved. If this is not so, it is not Heaven’s fault.
**[Annotation]** *So* means proper. Breath does not depend on awareness; it is through awareness that one loses propriety, and losing propriety leads to obstruction. Thus, awareness relies on breath, but breath does not rely on awareness. Yet the use of desire is controlled by the person—it is not an inevitable sign.
**[Commentary]** *So* means proper. Some indulge their six senses, chasing after external objects; others block their orifices, harming the boundary of life. Both extremes fail to accord with principle—these are the faults of human nature, not the blame of Heaven. Heaven bores through them day and night without ceasing,
**[Annotation]** The principle of flow has a constant motion.
**[Commentary]** *Ceasing* means stopping. The principle of nature bores through all things, from day to night, never halting. Yet people, in turn, block their apertures.
**[Annotation]** Without emotion, following Heaven, the apertures open.
**[Commentary]** *Apertures* are openings. Ordinary people, contrary to Heaven’s principle, obstruct their sensory orifices, drowning in stagnation.

The womb has layered chambers,
**[Annotation]** *Chambers* are empty spaces.
**[Commentary]** *Chambers* means emptiness. The human abdomen is hollow, allowing it to contain the stomach, and the stomach is hollow, allowing the passage of qi and fluids.

The mind has the wandering of Heaven.
**[Annotation]** *Wandering* means to be unbound.
**[Commentary]** Because it is empty, the natural Way wanders within it.

A room without emptiness leaves no space for mother and daughter-in-law to avoid quarreling;
**[Annotation]** A place of contention.
**[Commentary]** Without emptiness, a room cannot accommodate, so mother and daughter-in-law contend, and hierarchy is lost.

A mind without the wandering of Heaven leaves the six apertures in conflict.
**[Annotation]** *Conflict* means opposition.
**[Commentary]** *Apertures* are openings. *Conflict* means opposition. If the natural Way does not wander in the mind, the six senses oppose it, failing to follow principle.

The great forests and mountains are beneficial to people, yet even the spiritually attuned cannot prevail.
**[Annotation]** The principle of nature finds expression through things.
**[Commentary]** The principle of nature finds expression through things.

Virtue overflows into fame,
**[Annotation]** When fame is high, profit runs deep; thus, those who cultivate virtue exceed what is proper.
**[Commentary]** *Overflows* means excess. The Five Virtues of benevolence and righteousness are over-practiced because of the pursuit of fame and competition.

Fame overflows into violence,
**[Annotation]** To restrain violence is to make one’s fame surpass one’s virtue.

The violent inflict harm. Fame is the vessel of the scholar; when fame exceeds its proper measure, men inevitably turn to mutual destruction. As the *Inner Chapters* state: "Fame is that by which men grind against one another."

Plans are scrutinized in haste,
**[Annotation]** *Xuan* means urgency; only in urgency are plans examined.
**[Commentary]** *Ji* means to investigate. *Shei* means urgency. Only in matters of pressing difficulty are strategies weighed.

Does knowledge arise from affairs?
**[Annotation]** When one proceeds calmly, knowledge is of no use.
**[Commentary]** If one deploys the mind’s knowledge to venture beyond its bounds, strife inevitably follows.

Obstruction arises from clinging,
**[Annotation]** *Chai* means blockage.
**[Commentary]** *Chai* means blockage. *Shou* means grasping. When emotions are rigidly fixed, one’s achievements fail to flow.

Official duties are fulfilled through accommodating the many.
**[Annotation]** What the many deem fitting is not uniform; thus, official duties are established.
**[Commentary]** The establishment of offices and the ordering of affairs must accord with what the people find convenient. If one acts contrary to this, calamity and disorder arise.

When spring rains fall in season, grasses and trees burst forth in vigorous growth, and the plow and hoe begin their work.
**[Annotation]** The arising of all things has its cause.
**[Commentary]** *Diao* refers to implements like the plowshare. *Nou* means the hoe. In the season of verdant spring, when timely rains descend, all grasses and trees sprout and grow. Thus, farmers begin to prepare their tools. This illustrates acting in accord with the season, not opposing the nature of things.

More than half of the grasses and trees that reach maturity do so without men knowing why.
**[Annotation]** Affairs proceed from principle, and thus one remains unaware.
**[Commentary]** *Zhi* means to grow. Once the plow and hoe are prepared, weeds and reeds are cleared away. By good fortune, the spring days arrive, and hoeing ceases as growth begins. This is entirely due to the season’s influence and cannot be measured by human sentiment. Thus, we know that the establishment of laws and teachings must follow the times.

Stillness can remedy illness,
**[Annotation]** This does not mean one is not ill.
**[Commentary]** For those afflicted with restlessness and agitation, tranquility may serve as a cure.

Trimming the temples can restore youth,
**[Annotation]** This does not mean one does not age.
**[Commentary]** *Zì* refers to trimming the hair at the temples. *Cǐ* describes the appearance. The countenance of decline and old age may be refreshed through such grooming.

How could this bring an end to haste?
**[Annotation]** This does not mean one is not hasty.

**[Commentary]** *Jù* means swiftness. For those whose nature is hasty and pressed, tranquility may serve to restrain it. Nevertheless, such measures are the tasks of the toiling—those at ease have never once paused to inquire after them.

**[Annotation]** If such is the case, there remains toil, and thus those at ease transcend it without regard.

**[Commentary]** To still haste with calm, to cure agitation with stillness—these are but remedial expedients, the concerns of lesser minds and the burdens of those who exhaust their spirit and intellect. How could they be the heart of one who embodies the Dao, a person of leisure, untroubled and unafflicted? Their bearing is lofty, their disposition noble; they have never once deigned to glance at such matters.

The sage startles the world, yet the *shenren* has never once paused to inquire;
**[Annotation]** The *shenren* is the sage—"sage" describes their outward manifestation, "spirit" their inner nature.
**[Commentary]** *Jīng* means to astonish. "Spirit" is the name for the unfathomable; "sage" is the title of one who leaves traces. Because they bestow teachings and move others, they do not deign to inquire.

The worthy startles the age, yet the sage has never once paused to inquire;
**[Commentary]** The worthy realizes emptiness; the sage illuminates all. Gazing from the profound to the shallow, they do not inquire.

The noble person startles the state, yet the worthy has never once paused to inquire;
**[Commentary]** Why should the noble person alarm the feudal lords’ domains? The worthy, having attained what they possess, do not inquire.

The petty person conforms to the times, yet the noble person has never once paused to inquire.
**[Annotation]** Each advances in their own way; high and low occupy their proper stations.
**[Commentary]** The petty person of the world, who merely adapts to the moment—like the followers of Tian Dan—is of no worth. Thus, the refined and noble disdain them without a glance.

In the Yan Gate, when a kinsman died, one who excelled in mourning was appointed as the official leader. Half of his fellow townsmen mourned themselves to death.
**[Annotation]** To feign grief for reward is far from true filial piety—this is the excess of exalting the worthy.
**[Commentary]** *Shùmén* (束门) is also written as *yínmén* (寅门), read according to the character. The filial piety of the Eastern Gate arose from the heart, its sorrow manifest in outward appearance. The Lord of Song, admiring his utmost devotion, ennobled him and appointed him minister. When the villagers heard that he had been honored for his filiality, they forced wails and feigned grief, distorting their nature and falsifying their emotions. As a result, half of them perished.

Yao offered the empire to Xu You, but Xu You fled from it; Tang offered it to Wu Guang, and Wu Guang raged against him.

**[Annotation]** Yao, knowing Xu You’s worthiness, abdicated the throne to him. Xu You declined with a mere "wash my ears" and fled to Mount Ji. Tang offered the throne to Wu Guang, but Wu Guang refused, reviling and raging, then retreated deep into the forest. These men followed their innate nature, disdaining rank and emolument, without the least pretense or desire for fame.

When Ji Tuo heard of this, he led his disciples to squat by the waters of his home. The feudal lords came to offer condolences, and for three years, Shen Tu Di drowned himself in the river.

**[Annotation]** The turbulence of the waves harmed his nature, leading to this extremity.

**[Annotation]** Shen Tu Di and Ji Tuo were both recluses. Hearing that Tang had offered the throne to Wu Guang, Ji Tuo feared it might fall to him next, so he and his disciples crouched by the water. The feudal lords, admiring his integrity, came to console him, fearing he might drown himself. Shen Tu Di, hearing of this, envied their lofty reputation and threw himself into the Yellow River, drowning to death. The turbulence of the waves undid his nature, bringing him to this end.

The *quan* is what one uses to catch fish, but once the fish is caught, the *quan* is forgotten; the snare is what one uses to catch hares, but once the hare is caught, the snare is forgotten.

**[Annotation]** The *quan* is a fish trap made of bamboo, hence the character includes the bamboo radical. Some versions use the grass radical, referring to *sunquan*, an aromatic herb used as bait—placing the fragrant herb among reeds and brushwood to lure fish. The snare is a rabbit net, also called a rabbit noose, used to bind the hare’s legs, hence the name. These two examples serve as metaphors.

Words are what one uses to convey meaning, but once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten.

**[Annotation]** This is the synthesis of the analogy. *Meaning* refers to the subtle principle. Just as fish and hares are caught by means of the *quan* and snare, yet the *quan* and snare are not themselves fish or hares, so too does the profound principle rely on words for expression, though words are not the principle itself. Once the fish and hare are obtained, the *quan* and snare are forgotten; once the profound principle is understood, names and words fall away. How might I find one who has forgotten words, that I might speak with him?

**[Annotation]** When the two sages reach the state of no-mind, they are entirely without speech.

**[Annotation]** To forget words and grasp the principle is to perceive the Dao with a single glance—such people are rare indeed, hence this difficulty.

*Commentary and Annotations on the Southern Florescence True Scripture*, Scroll Twenty-Eight, concludes.

**Cheng Xuanying’s Subcommentary on the "Miscellaneous Chapters" of the *Zhuangzi*: "Parables" (Chapter Twenty-Seven)**

**Nineteen Parables**
*[Annotation]* When entrusted to others, nine out of ten words are believed.
*[Subcommentary]* *Yu* (寓) means "to entrust." The world’s people, deluded and suspicious, grow doubtful upon hearing the Way spoken by oneself. Yet when the same words are entrusted to others, nine out of ten are believed. Thus, figures like Hong Meng, Cloud General, Jian Wu, and Lian Shu are all parables.

**Seventeen Weighty Words**
*[Annotation]* What the world esteems is believed seven out of ten times.
*[Subcommentary]* *Zhongyan* (重言) refers to elders and village elders held in esteem. Even the words of old men are believed seven out of ten times.

**Goblet Words Emerge Daily, Harmonized with Heaven’s Boundary**
*[Annotation]* A goblet, when full, tilts; when empty, it rights itself—it does not hold fast. Applied to words, they follow things and adapt to change, yielding to what comes. Thus, they "emerge daily." "Emerge daily" means daily renewal; daily renewal exhausts the share of the natural, and when the natural’s share is exhausted, harmony is achieved.
*[Subcommentary]* A *zhi* (卮) is a wine vessel. "Emerge daily" means daily renewal. *Tianni* (天倪) is the share of the natural. *He* (和) means "to harmonize." A goblet tilts when full and rights itself when empty; empty or full, it follows the object, tilting or righting as others will. Words without intent are *zhi* words—thus, they do not speak. Words without attachment to tilting or righting accord with the natural’s share.

*Alternative interpretation:* *Zhi* (卮) means "to prop up." Propped-up words lack precision, hence they are called *zhi* words.

**Nineteen Parables Rely on External Discourse**
*[Annotation]* Words spoken by oneself are often rejected by the vulgar, so one borrows from others. Figures like Jian Wu and Lian Shu are those from whom one borrows.
*[Subcommentary]* *Jie* (藉) means "to borrow" or "to entrust to others." The phrase "nine out of ten words" refers to borrowing others’ voices to expound.

**A Father Does Not Act as His Son’s Matchmaker**
A father’s praise of his son is not as credible as that of a non-father.
*[Annotation]* A father’s praise of his son is often disbelieved, yet there are times when it is believed. However, it is invariably met with habitual suspicion, so one borrows external discourse.
*[Subcommentary]* *Mei* (媒) means "to bring together." When a father speaks of his son, people often disbelieve him; when another praises him, belief is more common.

**It Is Not My Fault, but the Fault of Others**
*[Annotation]* Though one may be trustworthy, those who harbor habitual doubt still do not accept it. Entrusting it to others, however, they believe. Such is the burden of how people listen.
*[Subcommentary]* *Wu* (吾) refers to the father. It is not that the father’s praise of his son is untrue, but that listeners groundlessly grow suspicious, making disbelief their fault.

**Agreement with Oneself Is Affirmed; Disagreement Is Rejected**
*[Annotation]* They mutually condemn one another.
*[Subcommentary]* The vulgar, inverted in their judgments, arbitrarily approve or condemn. What aligns with their own views is affirmed as right; what differs is rejected as wrong.

**Affirming What Aligns with Oneself, Condemning What Differs**
*[Annotation]* In matters of sameness and difference, two parties dispute their choices, yet both differ from the undebated third. Thus, they alone trust what they affirm. How could this be done without borrowing from others?
*[Subcommentary]* Clinging to sameness and difference, they falsely perceive right and wrong. When sameness and difference are empty, right and wrong vanish.

**Seventeen Weighty Words Serve to Conclude Speech—These Are the Venerable Elders**
*[Annotation]* Because they are venerable elders, the vulgar collectively esteem them. Even if their words do not rely on others, seven out of ten are still believed.
*[Subcommentary]* *Qiai* (耆艾) is a term for the long-lived. Speaking for oneself, without borrowing from others, one is esteemed as an elder and thus believed. Such is the delusion of the common world.

**One May Be Senior in Years, Yet Without the Warp and Weft of Root and Branch to Merit the Title of Venerable Elder**
*[Annotation]* One may precede others in age, but without root or branch to offer, one is not truly senior. *Qi* (期) means "to await."
*[Subcommentary]* *Qi* (期) means "to await." *Jing* (经) refers to the vertical (warp), *wei* (纬) to the horizontal (weft). This describes one who merely occupies a senior position by age yet lacks wisdom of root and branch. Thus, though treated with the respect due a venerable elder, this has nothing to do with moral precedence.

**One Who Has Nothing to Offer Others Has No Human Way; One Without the Human Way Is Merely a Worn-Out Person**
*[Annotation]* They are merely long-worn people, yet the vulgar readily believe them. Such is the world’s folly in clinging to habit.
*[Subcommentary]* Without ritual propriety to lead others, one lacks the Way of human relations—merely a worn-out person. Yet they are esteemed for this.

**Goblet Words Emerge Daily, Harmonized with Heaven’s Boundary, Flowing Without End, Thus Exhausting the Years**
*[Annotation]* The natural has its share, but right and wrong have no master. Without a master, they flow without end—who can settle them? Thus, one remains open and unattached, following as things come, allowing each to fulfill its natural lifespan.
*[Subcommentary]* *Manyan* (曼衍) means "without intent." Following the daily renewal of change, harmonizing with the natural’s share, one thus flows with the myriad things, meeting them without intent. This is how one exhausts the years of creation’s span and attains the farthest reaches of life’s longevity.

**Without Words, There Is Equality**
*[Subcommentary]* Principle resides in wordlessness; to speak is to deviate. Thus, to remain utterly wordless is to let things equalize themselves.

**Equality and Words Are Not Equal**
*[Subcommentary]* *Qi* (齐) means "without words." Wordlessness and words are not one, hence they are not equal.

**Words and Equality Are Not Equal**
*[Annotation]* Entrusting words to things and employing them as needed, right and wrong naturally equalize themselves. If one cannot establish words in accord with things to equalize them, then I and the myriad things are again unequal.

Thus it is said: "Without words." *[Annotation]* What they speak of are their own words; though there are words, I ultimately remain wordless. *[Subcommentary]* To use words to dispel words is an endless endeavor—even if one were to heap a hundred refutations, it would still not attain the subtlety. Only by concentrating one’s illumination on the sage, where wisdom merges with movement and stillness, and where action and silence share the same essence, can one achieve wordlessness in speech and speech in wordlessness. How then could there be a distinction between words and wordlessness, or between equality and inequality? Thus it is said: "Words are without words." "Words are without words"—throughout a lifetime of speaking, one has never truly spoken; *[Annotation]* Though they issue from my mouth, they are still their words. Throughout a lifetime of silence, one has never truly been silent. *[Annotation]* Judging by what issues from my mouth. *[Subcommentary]* This further explains the meaning of "words without words."

There are causes by which things are acceptable, and causes by which they are not; there are causes by which things are so, and causes by which they are not. *[Subcommentary]* Each clings to their own views, hence there is what is acceptable and what is so. When self and other are both empty, what is acceptable and what is so vanish. How is it so? It is so in being so. How is it not so? It is not so in not being so. How is it acceptable? It is acceptable in being acceptable. How is it unacceptable? It is unacceptable in being unacceptable. *[Annotation]* "Cause" (自) means "to arise from." From the bias of self and other, there arises what is acceptable and what is not. *[Subcommentary]* "How" (恶乎) means "in what." When self and other are both empty and all things are illusory, where is there room for what is acceptable or unacceptable? Where is there room for what is so or not so? Pursuing this to its end, what is so and what is acceptable naturally cease. This further explains the meaning of "there are causes by which things are so and acceptable."

Things inherently have what they deem so, things inherently have what they deem acceptable; *[Annotation]* Each is natural, each is acceptable in itself. There is nothing that is not so, nothing that is not acceptable. *[Annotation]* Speaking in general terms, there is nothing that is acceptable or unacceptable—yet this is the ultimate reach of what is acceptable and unacceptable. *[Subcommentary]* Among the things of the vulgar world, there are those who invert right and wrong, insisting on what is not so as so, and on what is unacceptable as acceptable. Without the daily-renewing words of the wine vessel, harmonizing with the natural boundary of heaven, who could endure for long? *[Annotation]* Only those whose words adapt to things and follow their natural allotment can avoid premature decline. *[Subcommentary]* Unless one follows the ceaseless transformations of each day and comprehends the principle of natural spontaneity, who can attain the Way of long life and enduring vision? This is the ultimate attainment of those who grasp it.

All things are seeds, succeeding one another in different forms. *[Annotation]* Though they transform and replace one another, their *qi* is originally one. *[Subcommentary]* "Succeed" (禅) means "to replace." All things, receiving their endowment from creation, share the same *qi* yet differ in form. They flow ceaselessly, replacing one another in succession. Beginning and end are like a ring; *[Annotation]* What is a beginning today was already an end yesterday. *[Subcommentary]* The transformations of things are like a circle—death and birth, end and beginning, follow one another in turn. This describes the state of succession and replacement. None can grasp their order; *[Annotation]* The principle is thus of itself—hence none can grasp it. *[Subcommentary]* "Order" (伦) means "principle." Seeking the Way of transformation, one ultimately finds no principle to attain. This is called the "harmony of heaven" (天均). The harmony of heaven is the "boundary of heaven" (天倪). *[Annotation]* Is harmony and equality arbitrary? They are all the natural allotment of heaven. *[Subcommentary]* "Harmony" (均) means "equality." This summarizes the preceding chapter, stating that the Way of natural equality is the Way of harmonious equality, also called the "natural allotment."

Zhuangzi said to Huizi: "Confucius, at sixty years of age, underwent sixty transformations." *[Annotation]* He moved with the times. *[Subcommentary]* As the flow never ceases and renewal is unending, his years advanced to sixty while he transformed with each year. Now, Zhuangzi and Huizi often met to discuss the profound Dao, so he cited Confucius from afar to illustrate the method of transformation. What he initially deemed right, he later deemed wrong; *[Annotation]* As the times change, so do customs. One who rides things to roam the mind—how is he different from the vulgar?

The present "right" is not the wrong of fifty-nine years ago—yet who knows if today’s "right" will not become next year’s "wrong"? *[Annotation]* Change never ceases; rightness cannot be constant. *[Subcommentary]* A person’s lifespan is reckoned by the years, yet the years themselves are not fixed—how then can reckoning be certain? Thus what was right last year is wrong this year. From this we know that this year’s right was last year’s wrong, and this year’s wrong will be next year’s right. Therefore the Master of Rongcheng said: "Remove the days, and there are no years." Huizi said: "Confucius exerted his will and employed his knowledge." *[Annotation]* He meant that Confucius exerted his will and employed his knowledge to attain understanding, rather than allowing things to transform of themselves. This shows that Huizi fell short of the sage’s far-reaching resonance. *[Subcommentary]* "Employed" means "put to use." Huizi, not having grasped the Way, conjectured about Confucius, saying that he roused his will and diligently practiced, applying his mind to study the Dao, and thus attained his wisdom—not that he naturally entrusted himself to transformation. Zhuangzi said: "Confucius has moved beyond that, yet he has never spoken of it." *[Annotation]* He moved beyond transformation as something self-so, not something achieved by knowledge or effort; thus he followed the times and entrusted himself to things without contriving words. *[Subcommentary]* "Moved beyond" means "replaced." "Yet" refers to you. "Never" means "not at all."

Nipha had long since replaced the laboring mind of devotion—you ought to awaken your spirit anew and cease your reckless words.

Confucius said: “One receives one’s endowment from the Great Root and revives the spirit to live.”
*[Annotation]* If one employs one’s talents and knowledge without reviving the root-spirit, life is lost.
*[Subcommentary]* All people receive their talents and wisdom from the wondrous root of the Great Dao and return to the spirit-mandate to fulfill their life’s course—how could they labor their wills and employ their minds, going against the Creator’s work? This is Zhuangzi recounting Confucius’ words to rebuke Huizi.

When he intoned, it accorded with the pitch-pipes; when he spoke, it matched the standards.
*[Annotation]* Intoning arises from the pitch-pipes; speech issues from the standards. Yet pitch-pipes and standards are what the multitude creates—sages merely employ them. Thus nothing fails to accord, yet he never spoke of them, never acted upon them.
*[Subcommentary]* *Intoning* means sound. *Accorded* means matched. The sage Nipha, in virtue harmonizing with yin and yang, made his tones resonate with the bell-pitches and his teachings align with the models.

Profit and duty lay before him, yet likes and dislikes, right and wrong merely served the mouths of others.
*[Annotation]* *Served* means employed. I have no words of my own—what I speak merely employs the mouths of others. The display of likes and dislikes, right and wrong, profit and duty never issued from my own mouth.
*[Subcommentary]* Benevolence and duty, profit and harm, likes and dislikes, right and wrong—these respond to the opportunities before him, expounded in due time. Though words issue from his mouth, they follow what is before him, which is to employ the mouths of others.

Thus he made people submit with their hearts and dare not stand in opposition, settling what settles the world.
*[Annotation]* The mouth expresses the heart. Having employed the mouths of others, he employs their hearts. I follow the hearts of others, so their hearts trust—who would dare stand in opposition? I settle the world by relying on its self-settling—what more is there to do?
*[Subcommentary]* Adapting to what suits the multitude, he employs their hearts and minds. Teaching follows things, and things submit in turn, like grass bending to the wind, daring not stand in opposition. Following their inherent stillness, he settles them according to their nature—thus he settles what settles the world.

“Enough, enough! I shall never reach his level.”
*[Annotation]* Riding along with things, nothing fails to reach.
*[Subcommentary]* *Enough* means stop. *His* refers to Confucius. Repeatedly admonishing Huizi to cease speaking, [Zhuangzi says,] “We are too shallow to attain his level.” This is Zhuangzi’s praise of Nipha’s words.

Master Zeng took office twice, and his heart transformed twice.
*[Subcommentary]* His surname was Zeng, given name Shen, a disciple of Confucius. The meaning of “took office twice” is explained below.

He said: “When I took office while my parents were alive, three *fu* brought me joy; later, when I took office after their passing, three thousand *zhong* did not suffice—I grieved in my heart.”
*[Annotation]* *Sufficed* means reached.
*[Subcommentary]* Six *dou* and four *sheng* make one *fu*; six *hu* and four *dou* make one *zhong*. *Sufficed* means reached. Zeng Shen, being most filial, sought office to provide for his parents. Thus, when he first took office while his parents were alive, though his salary was meager, he rejoiced; later, after their passing, though his salary was great, he grieved. This is what is meant by “transformed twice”—his heart changed between sorrow and joy because he could no longer provide for his parents.

His disciples asked Confucius: “Can one say that Shen is free from fault in this?”
*[Annotation]* *Fault* means entanglement. They mean that Shen took office for his parents’ sake and was not entangled by salary.
*[Subcommentary]* *Entanglement* means attachment. Among the disciples, none are named—this must refer to one of the Four Categories or Ten Worthies. Zeng Shen, being benevolent and filial, sought office to provide for his parents. Though his heart changed between sorrow and joy, he should be free from fault. The disciples, doubting this, asked Confucius.

[Confucius] said: “He was already entangled.”
*[Annotation]* Entangled by salary to provide for them. One free from entanglement—could he feel sorrow?
*[Annotation]* Providing for parents is fitting, regardless of means. If one could be free from entanglement, one would not weigh high or low in mind but remain peaceful and joyful, fulfilling the proper expression of care.

*[Subcommentary]* The filial son serves his parents with the aim of suiting them, regardless of the salary’s size. He fulfills the expression of care, and thus there are those who, though hired laborers, are called filial sons, while others, though having taken office three times, are still deemed unfilial. Since Shen’s heart held sorrow and joy, was he not entangled by salary? Only one free from entanglement would feel no sorrow or joy.

He regarded three *fu* and three thousand *zhong* as observing sparrows and mosquitoes passing before him.
*[Annotation]* *He* refers to one free from entanglement. One free from entanglement regards honor and salary as mosquitoes, sparrows, or flies passing before him—how could there be sorrow or joy in between?
*[Subcommentary]* *He* refers to one free from entanglement. Sparrows are large, likened to a thousand *zhong*; mosquitoes and flies are small, likened to three *fu*. One who has attained the Dao is free from attachment to salary—whether a thousand *zhong* or three *fu*, he does not perceive more or less. Like sparrows, mosquitoes, or flies flying past before him, they pass by and that is all—how could he be entangled?

Yan Cheng Ziyou said to Dongguo Zijing: “Since I heard your words, after one year I became rustic,
*[Annotation]* Detached from external advantages.
*[Subcommentary]* Living east of the outer wall, he was called Dongguo—this is the same Nan Guo Ziqi from the “Equalizing Things” chapter. Ziyou was Ziqi’s disciple. *Rustic* means unrefined. Having heard the Dao for a year, his learning was not yet mature, but he gradually became simple, shedding superficiality.

after two years I followed,
*[Annotation]* Did not act on his own.
*[Subcommentary]* Submitted to custom.

after three years I penetrated,
*[Annotation]* Penetrated self and others.
*[Subcommentary]* Did not cling to circumstances.

after four years I became one with things,
*[Annotation]* United with things.
*[Subcommentary]* United with things.

after five years they came to me...”

after six years the spirits entered,
*[Annotation]* Transcended the bodily form.
*[Subcommentary]* Spirit harmonized with principle and things.

after seven years Heaven was perfected,
*[Annotation]* Nothing left to do.
*[Subcommentary]* Accorded with nature’s completion.

after eight years I knew not death, knew not life,
*[Annotation]* Whatever encountered was fitting and at peace.
*[Subcommentary]* Wisdom obscured the Maker of Things, spirit merged with nature—thus he perceived no difference between death and life, gathering and dispersal.

after nine years the Great Mystery.
*[Annotation]* Mystery means excellence. Good and evil became the same, so nowhere was not darkness.
This speaks of long hearing the Dao, knowing the spontaneity of Heaven’s pipes, until suddenly self-forgetting, whereupon defilements daily fell away to the point of exhaustion.
*[Subcommentary]* Mystery means subtlety. Having heard the Dao for days on end, the heart of learning gradually took hold, enabling him to transcend the four propositions, cut off the hundred negations, reach the ultimate of profound darkness, exhaust the myriad mysteries, and attain vast illumination—hence it is called “great.”

Principled life is activity—death.
*[Annotation]* To live while acting is to lose one’s life.
*[Subcommentary]* Dwelling in the human way, sunk in activity, is to return to death and extinction.

I urge you, sir, because your death has a cause.
*[Annotation]* Cause means reason. Death comes from activity; activity comes from prizing one’s life.
Now what I urge you about is that your death arises from prizing it.
*[Subcommentary]* Sir means impartiality. Cause means reason. That which leads human life into the realm of death is still prizing one’s life, unable to be impartial—hence the exhortation.

Yet life is yang—it has no cause.
*[Annotation]* Life’s yang, proceeding by leaving no traces and doing nothing, suddenly arises alone—it has no reason.
*[Subcommentary]* Moved by yang qi, this life comes to be; since it has no reason to follow, it is not worth prizing.

Is it truly so?
*[Subcommentary]* Truly means certainty. Yang qi generates things—this is certainly so.

Where is it fitting? Where is it not fitting?
*[Annotation]* Yet it is truly so, hence there is nowhere it is fitting and nowhere it is not fitting—only then is it everywhere fitting, and everywhere fitting is arrival.
*[Subcommentary]* Qi gathers to form life—life is not worth rejoicing over; qi disperses to form death—death is not worth grieving over. Since life and death are equal, joy and sorrow vanish. Thus where is it fitting? Where is it not fitting? Everywhere is fitting.

Heaven has its celestial reckonings, earth has its human settlements—where should I seek them?
*[Annotation]* All are self-sufficient.
*[Subcommentary]* The stars’ reckonings and celestial patterns adorn Heaven; the nine provinces and four extremities are where humans and things depend—within creation, all is already complete in me. Where should I seek them outside?

No one knows its end—how can it be without destiny?
*[Annotation]* Principle must end of itself, not through knowing—if not destiny, what is it?
*[Subcommentary]* Heaven and earth’s day and night, humans and things’ life and death—tracing their roots, no one knows beginning or end. Timing comes and goes—if not destiny, what is it? To say it is without destiny is to speak of its having destiny.

No one knows its beginning—how can it have destiny?
*[Annotation]* Not knowing why it is so yet it is so—this is called destiny. It seems as if there were intention, hence the name of destiny is again set aside to clarify its spontaneity, and only then is the principle of destiny complete.
*[Subcommentary]* Death goes, life comes, like spring, autumn, winter, summer—since there is no beginning or end, how can it be destiny? To say it has destiny is to speak of its having no destiny. This again sets aside destiny.

There is that to which it responds—how can it be without spirits?
*[Annotation]* Principle must have a response, as if there were numinous spirits to bring it about.
*[Subcommentary]* Spirits mean numinous awareness. The ears and eyes respond to sounds and colors, the heart-mind responds to things—this is like echo and shadow. How can there be no numen? To say it is without spirits is to speak of its having them.

There is nothing to which it responds—how can it have spirits?
*[Annotation]* Principle responds of itself; response does not come from anything else—thus although it responds, there is no numen.
*[Subcommentary]* When a person sleeps, they do not know external things; though they have eyes and ears, they do not respond to colors and sounds. If there were numen, how could it not respond? To say it has spirits is to speak of its having none. This again sets aside its having them.

The Penumbra asked the Shadow:
“Earlier you were bowing, now you are looking up; earlier your hair was tied up, now it is loose; earlier you were sitting, now you are standing; earlier you were walking, now you are still—why?”
*[Subcommentary]* Penumbra is the faint darkness outside the shadow. This is a parable. “You” means “you.” Bowing means lowering the head. Tied up means binding the hair. Your sitting and standing, walking and stopping, follow only the form—judging by this, you must exist because of the form. The principle does not wait—its subtlety is not yet clear. This question and answer are set forth to reveal solitary transformation.

The Shadow replied: "It moves of itself—why ask at all?"
*[Annotation]* Its movement is spontaneous, with nothing to prompt inquiry.
*[Subcommentary]* "Of itself" describes effortless, unthinking motion. "Why" means "for what reason." The Shadow answers: My movement is without intent, serene and self-content, requiring nothing, arising through solitary transformation. You know nothing of this—why trouble me with questions? I have these movements yet do not know their cause.
*[Annotation]* It is spontaneous, thus its cause is unknown.
*[Subcommentary]* "I" means "me." All my movements and stillness follow the Creator, yet I do not know their origin. None can fathom how they arise—how could they depend on anything? I am like the cicada’s husk, the snake’s sloughed skin—resembling them yet not the same.
*[Annotation]* The shadow resembles form yet is not form.
*[Subcommentary]* The cicada’s husk is its cast shell; the snake’s slough is its shed skin. When a grub transforms into a cicada, or a snake emerges from its skin, neither is aware of the change. The grub perishes before, the cicada appears after—yet the cicada does not arise *from* the grub, nor does it wait upon the grub to come into being. The same principle applies to the snake’s skin. Thus we know that all the myriad existences do not depend on one another but arise through solitary transformation, all called "self-so." Therefore the Shadow says: My dependence is like the snake’s slough or the cicada’s husk—seeming to rely on form yet in truth not dependent on it. Fire and sunlight are my gathering; darkness and night are my succession.

**[Subcommentary]**
"Layering" (屯) means gathering; "succession" (代) means passing away. When there is fire or sunlight, the shadow gathers; when night or darkness comes, the shadow fades. If the shadow were truly dependent on form, it would not rely on fire or sunlight. Yet in darkness, form exists without shadow—thus we know the shadow does not depend on form, and the principle of solitary transformation is manifest. Why then does it seem to have dependence?

**[Subcommentary]**
What the shadow seems to depend upon is fire and sunlight. Yet if the mind had no form, fire and sunlight could not produce a shadow—thus the shadow does not truly depend on them either. How then could one claim it has dependence?

**[Annotation]**
Pushing this to its limit, what we now call "dependence" ultimately leads to "non-dependence," and the principle of solitary transformation is revealed.

**[Subcommentary]**
Moreover, what has dependence is form. Without fire or sunlight, form cannot produce a shadow—thus the shadow does not depend on form. Since form arises without fire or sunlight, how could the shadow’s arising depend on form? Using fire and sunlight as an analogy, we see clearly that the shadow does not depend on form. If even form and shadow do not depend on one another, how much less do other things? Thus we know all the myriad dharmas arise through solitary transformation.

When that (form) comes, I (the shadow) come with it; when that goes, I go with it; when that grows bright, I grow bright with it. Yet what question is there in brightness?

**[Annotation]**
It simply moves with brightness of its own accord—following along, coming and going without intention, beyond all questioning.

**[Subcommentary]**
"That" refers to form. "Brightness" describes its movement. Coming and going, movement and stillness—form and shadow occur simultaneously, yet without mutual dependence, all relying on solitary transformation. The principle of solitary transformation is wondrous beyond all names and words; questions and answers about it are already complete.

Yang Ziju traveled south to Pei, while Lao Dan journeyed west to Qin. They met by chance in the outskirts and encountered each other in Liang.

**[Subcommentary]**
His surname was Yang, given name Zhu, courtesy name Ziju. "Traveled" (之) means went. Pei was Pengcheng, now Xuzhou. "Met by chance" (邀) means encountered. Liang was now Bianzhou. Yang Zhu was heading south, Laozi traveling west—they chanced upon each other in the lands of Liang and Song, meeting in the wilds where Laozi spoke to him.

Midway, Laozi looked up to heaven and sighed: "At first I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot."

**[Subcommentary]**
When they first met, he believed Yang had the heart of the Dao; now seeing his arrogance, he knew him untrainable. Displeased by his divergence from the common way, he lamented.

Yang Ziju did not answer.

**[Subcommentary]**
Aware of his own faults, he fell silent in shame.

Upon reaching the inn, he brought water for washing, a towel and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees.

**[Subcommentary]**
"Washing" (盥) means cleansing; "comb" (栉) means to arrange. Arriving at the lodging, he entered the guest quarters. There he brought water to rinse and wash, took up towel and comb, crawled forward on his knees, and bowed in utmost reverence—his thighs trembling as he sought instruction, hoping to receive correction.

He said: "Earlier, your disciple wished to ask you, but you were traveling without pause, so I dared not. Now there is pause—may I ask what my fault was?"

**[Subcommentary]**
Rebuked before, he wished to inquire of his error, but the master was traveling without respite. Now, having reached the inn with leisure, he hoped to hear the reason for the rebuke, to aid his future conduct.

Laozi said: "Your haughty glare—with whom could you dwell?"

**[Annotation]**
"Haughty glare" describes domineering arrogance. People will fear and distance themselves.

**[Subcommentary]**
"Haughty glare" (睢睢盱盱) describes restless aggression and overbearing pride. "You" (而) means "you." With such domineering force and ostentatious display, all will shrink from you—who would dwell with you?

"The purest white appears sullied; the greatest virtue seems insufficient."

**[Subcommentary]**
Those who are incorruptibly pure seem as if stained; those of perfect virtue appear lacking. This is Laozi quoting the *Daodejing* to admonish Ziju.

Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: "I respectfully receive your teaching."

**[Subcommentary]**
"Abruptly" (蹴然) means with startled shame. Having received the master’s instruction, his alarm deepened—he bowed in reverence, humbly accepting the command.

When he had gone before, the innkeeper had welcomed and escorted him; the master of the house held the mat, his wife the towel and comb. The seated guests avoided his seat, and the fire-tender shrank from the hearth.

**[Annotation]**
His bearing set him apart, so all shrank from him in awe.

**[Subcommentary]**
"Escorted" (将) means sent off. The master of the house (家公) refers to the innkeeper. "Fire-tender" (炀) means one who tends the flame. When Yang Zhu first went to Pei, he conducted himself with imposing dignity. Arriving at the inn, the host welcomed and saw him off; the master of the house held the mat, his wife the comb and towel. Those already seated fled his seat, and the fire-tender dared not approach the hearth—his power over others reached such extremes.

On his return, the innkeeper vied with him for a seat.

**[Annotation]**
This was because he had shed his arrogance.

**[Subcommentary]**
Returning from Pei, having received the master’s teaching, he cast off his ostentation and pride, blending his traces with the dust and harmonizing his light with the world. Thus the innkeeper now competed with him for a seat.

*Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan*

**Commentary by Master Cheng Xuanying of the Tang, Western Florescence School**
*Miscellaneous Chapters, "Yielding the Throne" Twenty-Eighth*

When Yao yielded the realm to Xu You, Xu You declined. He then yielded it to Zizhou Zhifu, who replied: "That you would make me Son of Heaven is acceptable. Nevertheless, I presently suffer from a malady of profound care; I am just now attending to it and have no leisure to govern the realm."

*Commentary:*
The deeds of Yao and Xu You are fully recorded in the *Inner Chapters*. His surname was Zi, his given name Zhou, and his courtesy name Zhifu—a man who embraced the Dao, a recluse. Yao, knowing his worth, offered him the imperial throne. "That I should be emperor would indeed be fitting," he said, hence his words "is acceptable." *You* means "profound"; *you* means "toil." He declared: "I am mired in depths of care, my heart burdened with toil. I am now cultivating myself, hoping to align with the Dao, and have no spare moment to order the myriad affairs." The realm is the weightiest of all things, yet he would not let it harm his life—how much less would he allow other things to do so?

*Commentary:*
To ascend to the ninefold dignity, to wield the might of ten thousand chariots, is the highest honor among men—yet he would not let such glory and eminence impair his livelihood. How then could other external things trouble his mind? Only one who takes no account of the realm is fit to be entrusted with it.

*Commentary:*
One who forgets the realm takes no thought of it; only such a person may be entrusted with its governance.

Shun yielded the realm to Zizhou Zhibo, who replied: "I presently suffer from a malady of profound care; I am just now attending to it and have no leisure to govern the realm."

*Commentary:*
The deeds of Shun are fully set forth in the *Inner Chapters*. Zhibo is the same as Zhifu.

Thus the realm is a vessel of great weight, yet he would not exchange his life for it—this is how those who possess the Dao differ from the common run.

*Commentary:*
The throne of the emperor is a vessel of the greatest weight, yet he would not let such honor rob him of his life. Without the Dao, who could act thus? This is how he differs from the conduct of the vulgar.

Shun yielded the realm to Shan Juan, who replied: "I stand amid the cosmos. In winter I wear furs and pelts; in summer, fine linen. In spring I plow and sow, my body sufficient for labor; in autumn I reap and gather, my person sufficient for rest and sustenance."

Sun rises, and I rise to work; sun sets, and I rest. I roam at ease between Heaven and Earth, my heart content. Why should I take the realm for myself?

*Commentary:*
His surname was Shan, given name Juan, a recluse. Dwelling within the Six Directions, in harmony with the Four Seasons, he found his place between Heaven and Earth, wandering free beyond the dust and grime. The Dao was within him, and so he had no use for the realm. Alas, you do not know me! Thus he refused. Then he departed and entered the deep mountains, and none knew his whereabouts.

*Commentary:*
The ancients, in their simplicity, called the emperor "son." He lamented that Shun did not recognize the purity of the wild.

Shun yielded the realm to his friend, the farmer of Shihu. The farmer of Shihu said: "How toilsome is the lord’s conduct! A man of unyielding strength!"

*Commentary:*
The character *hu* may also be written as *hu*, and is read accordingly. Shihu is a place name. *Nong* means "person," as people in the south still call a man *nong*. This was Shun’s friend. *Bao* means "firm." He said that Shun’s will was resolute, his strength exerted to the utmost, his back bent with labor, never able to rest. For all this toil, he now offers the realm—thus he refused. He deemed Shun’s virtue not yet perfected. Then, his wife bearing their child on her head, the husband shouldering their load, they entered the sea and never returned.

*Commentary:*
The ancients carried burdens on their heads, a custom still seen among the Koreans. Believing Shun’s transformative virtue not yet supreme, they took their wife and child and left, never to tread his land again. They entered the islands of the great sea and departed, never to return.

King Tai of the Great Clan dwelt in Bin. The Di tribes attacked him...

The *Subcommentary* states: Danfu was the father of King Ji and the grandfather of King Wen. *Na* was the name of a place. The Di tribes were the Xianyun. As the state bordered the Rong and Di barbarians, it suffered their attacks. Danfu offered them furs and silks, but they refused; he offered them dogs and horses, but they refused; he offered them pearls and jades, but they refused—for what the Di tribes sought was land. Danfu then said: “To dwell in a man’s elder brother’s land and kill his younger brother, to dwell in a man’s father’s land and kill his son—this I cannot bear. All of you, strive to remain here. What difference is there between serving as my subjects and serving the Di tribes?”

The *Subcommentary* states: *Shi* means “to offer.” *Mian* means “to exert oneself.” *Xi* means “how.” The Di tribes were greedy and cruel, their intent fixed on the land. Unwilling to inflict harm or slaughter, Danfu urged his people to remain. Moreover, he had heard that one must not harm what one nourishes for the sake of what nourishes it. Thereupon, he took up his staff and departed. The people followed in a continuous stream, and thus a state was established beneath Mount Qi.

The *Subcommentary* states: *Yong yang* refers to the land, and *suo yang* to the common people. The land is originally used to nourish the people, but now men kill the people to preserve the land—this is unacceptable. Having leaned on his staff and left, the people followed in succession, and thus a state was founded at Qiyang.

This Danfu, the Grand King, could indeed be called one who honored life. Those who honor life, though noble and wealthy, do not harm their bodies for the sake of nourishment; though poor and lowly, they do not burden their forms for the sake of profit. Yet men of the present age who occupy high office and exalted rank all fear losing them. Seeing profit, they lightly cast aside their lives—are they not deluded?

The *Subcommentary* states: In this chaotic age of deceit and shallowness, men’s hearts are frivolous. They pursue carriages and caps at the cost of their lives, chase wealth and profit to the ruin of their persons, unaware of what is light and what is heavy—deeply mired in confusion.

The people of Yue assassinated their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, fearing this, fled into the cinnabar caves. When Yue was left without a ruler, the people sought Prince Sou and found him in the cinnabar caves. Prince Sou refused to emerge, so the people of Yue smoked him out with mugwort. They then bore him forth in a jade carriage.

The *Subcommentary* states: *Sou* was the prince’s name. The cinnabar caves were caverns in the southern mountains. The jade carriage was the ruler’s chariot. Some texts write *wang* (“king”) instead of *yu* (“jade”), to be read according to the character—this refers to the jade imperial chariot. The people of Yue had repeatedly assassinated their rulers, so the prince, seized with terror, fled into the caves. When they summoned him and he would not emerge, they smoked him out with mugwort. Having entreated him to become their ruler, they bore him forth in the jade imperial chariot.

Prince Sou grasped the carriage rope and mounted, then looked up to heaven and cried: “Rulership! Rulership! Can you truly not spare me?” Prince Sou did not hate being a ruler—he hated the calamities that came with rulership. Such a man as Prince Sou could indeed be called one who did not harm his life for the sake of the state. This was precisely what the people of Yue desired in a ruler.

The *Subcommentary* states: *Yuan* means “to pull.” *Sui* refers to the rope on a carriage. Unable to escape, he sighed deeply as he mounted the chariot. He did not hate being a ruler—he feared the disasters it would bring. As he valued life over rank, he could be compelled to become a ruler.

Han and Wei contended over disputed territory. Master Hua Zi visited Marquis Zhao of Han, who wore a troubled expression.

The *Subcommentary* states: Marquis Zhao was the ruler of Han. Master Hua was a worthy man of Wei. As Han and Wei were neighbors, they fought over border lands. With weapons drawn and victory uncertain, the marquis was anxious and fearful, hence his troubled expression.

Master Hua Zi said: “Suppose now that the world inscribed a decree before you, which read: ‘If you seize it with your left hand, your right hand will be severed; if you seize it with your right hand, your left hand will be severed. Yet whoever seizes it shall possess the world.’ Would you seize it?”

The *Subcommentary* states: *Ming* means “inscription.” *Jue* means “to grasp.” *Fei* means “to sever.” Suppose an inscription were placed before you: if you took it with your left hand, your right hand would be cut off; if you took it with your right hand, your left hand would be cut off. Yet whoever took it would gain the world—would you take it? This analogy was offered as a question to the Marquis of Han.

Marquis Zhao said: “I would not seize it.”

The *Subcommentary* states: He replied that he could not sever both arms to gain the world.

Master Hua Zi said: “Excellent. From this we may observe that two arms are weightier than the world, and the body is weightier than two arms. How much lighter is Han than the world!

The *Subcommentary* states: *Zi* means “from.” Observing this, we see that the body is weightier than two arms, and two arms are weightier than the world. The world, in turn, is weightier than Han—the difference in weight between Han and the world is vast.

What you now contend over is even lighter than Han. Yet you stubbornly grieve, harming your life and troubling your spirit over what you may not obtain—are you not deluded?”

The *Subcommentary* states: What they contended over was mere borderland, thus even lighter than Han. Yet the marquis stubbornly grieved, harming his form and injuring his nature, fearing he might not gain it—was he not deluded?

Marquis Zhao said: “Well said! Many have instructed me, but never have I heard such words.”

Master Zihua could indeed be called one who understood the weight of things.

*The Subcommentary* states: He suddenly awakened to these words, marveling at their wonder.

The Lord of Lu, hearing that Yan He was a man who had attained the Dao, sent an envoy bearing gifts to approach him first.

*The Subcommentary* states: The Lord of Lu was Duke Ai of Lu, though some say it was Duke Ding. Yan, whose given name was He, was a man of Lu and a recluse. The *bi* were silk offerings. Having heard that Yan He had attained the Dao of purity and integrity, the duke wished to appoint him as minister, so he dispatched an envoy bearing silk to convey his intent.

Yan He dwelt in a humble lane, wearing coarse hempen cloth and tending cattle himself.

*The Subcommentary* states: *Ju* cloth was made from ramie. *Fan* means “to feed.” Living in a crude and narrow alley, clad in rough and shabby cloth, he personally fed the cattle—this sufficiently showed his poverty and frugality.

When the envoy of the Lord of Lu arrived, Yan He received him himself. The envoy asked: “Is this the home of Yan He?” Yan He replied: “This is indeed He’s home.” When the envoy presented the gifts, Yan He responded: “I fear the messenger may have misheard and thus incur blame. It would be better to verify.”

*The Subcommentary* states: *Yi* means “to give.” Unwilling to accept the gifts, he fabricated this excuse to deceive the envoy. The envoy returned to confirm, then came back to seek him, but by then it was too late. Thus, one like Yan He truly despised wealth and honor.

Therefore it is said: The true essence of the Dao is for cultivating the self; its remnants may be used to govern the state; its dregs, like dirt and straw, may be used to govern the world. From this we see that the achievements of emperors and kings are but the leftover tasks of sages—these are not the means to preserve the body and nourish life.

*The Subcommentary* states: *Xu* means “remnants.” *Tu* means “dung,” and *ju* means “straw.” One who employs the true Dao to sustain the self must regard governing the state as a residual matter, and ruling the world as no more than dirt and straw. Yet the gentlemen of this vulgar age often endanger their bodies and abandon their lives in pursuit of things—is this not lamentable?

Whenever the sage acts, he must examine both his purpose and his means.

*The Subcommentary* states: *Xun* means “to pursue.” He observes where the people of the world are headed and what the common folk are doing, then acts in response.

Now suppose there were a man here who used the Pearl of Marquis Sui to shoot at a sparrow a thousand *ren* high—surely the world would laugh at him. Why? Because what he employed was weighty, while what he sought was light. How much more so is life itself, which is far weightier than the Pearl of Marquis Sui!

*The Subcommentary* states: The state of Sui lay near the Pu River, which produced precious pearls—these were the gems carried by the spirit-snake in repayment of kindness, obtained by the Marquis of Sui, hence called the Pearl of Marquis Sui. The sparrow flew a thousand *ren* high; to shoot at it with such a pearl was to seek something light with something weighty. To harm life in pursuit of things follows the same principle.

Master Liezi was poor, and his countenance bore the hue of hunger. A guest mentioned this to Ziyang of Zheng, saying: “Lie Yukou is a man of the Dao, yet he dwells in your state in poverty. Might this not suggest that you, my lord, do not esteem scholars?”

*The Subcommentary* states: Ziyang was the minister of Zheng. Yukou was a man of Zheng, a man of the Dao who lived in poverty. The guest, speaking in veiled terms, reproached Ziyang for not valuing worthy scholars.

Ziyang of Zheng immediately ordered an official to send him grain. When Master Liezi saw the messenger, he bowed twice and declined.

*The Subcommentary* states: He commanded the official in charge of the granary to give him grain. Yukou, being of lofty integrity, declined the offer with thanks.

The messenger departed, and when Master Liezi entered his home, his wife struck her breast and said: “I have heard that the wives and children of men of the Dao all live in ease and joy. Yet here you are with the look of hunger. If you had accepted the food the master sent, you would not have suffered so. Is this not fate?”

*The Subcommentary* states: Having refused the grain, she lamented their destined poverty, beating her breast and reproaching her husband’s error. Thus it is clear that the wife of Liezi fell far short of the wife of Laolai.

Master Liezi laughed and said to her: “The lord did not know me of his own accord. Because someone spoke of me, he sent me grain; and if he were to blame me, it would again be on the basis of someone’s words. This is why I did not accept it.” In the end, the people indeed rose in revolt and killed Ziyang.

*The Subcommentary* states: Ziyang was harsh and cruel, and many resented him. When one of his attendants accidentally broke his bow, fearing punishment, he incited the people—who were already chasing a mad dog—to kill Ziyang.

King Zhao of Chu lost his state, and the butcher Shuo fled with him.

*The Subcommentary* states: King Zhao, whose given name was Zhen, was the son of King Ping. When Wu She and Wu Shang were executed by King Ping, Wu Zixu fled to Wu and tilled the fields. Later, in the reign of King Helü of Wu, he requested troops to attack Chu, breached the capital of Ying to avenge his father, and forced King Zhao into desperate flight—first to Sui, then to Zheng. A butcher named Shuo accompanied the king in his flight. The reason for his flight is explained below.

When King Zhao returned to his state, he wished to reward those who had followed him, including the butcher Shuo. The butcher Shuo said: “When the great king lost his state, I lost my butcher’s trade. Now that the great king has returned, I have returned to my butcher’s trade. My rank and salary have been restored—what reward is there to give?”

The king said: “Insist that he accept.” The butcher Shuo replied: “When the great king lost his state, it was not my fault, so I dared not accept punishment. Now that the great king has returned, it is not my merit, so I dare not claim reward.”

The king said: “Let me see him.” The butcher Shuo replied: “According to the laws of Chu, only those who have rendered great merit and received heavy rewards may be granted an audience. My wisdom is insufficient to preserve the state, and my courage is insufficient to die in battle against the enemy. When the Wu army entered Ying, I fled in fear of danger to avoid the enemy—it was not that I deliberately followed the great king. Now if the great king wishes to set aside the law and break the covenant to see me, this is not what I wish to be heard of in the world.”

King Zhuang of Chu then addressed Minister Si of the Marshal’s Office: “The butcher Shuo dwells in lowly circumstances yet sets forth principles of the highest order. You must extend to him an invitation to the rank of the Three Standards.”

(Note: The Three Standards denote the Three Dukes. Some texts write “gui” [jade tablets], for the Three Ministers all hold gui, hence the Three Ministers are called gui.)

Butcher Shuo replied: “The rank of the Three Standards—I know it is nobler than my butcher’s stall; the salary of ten thousand bushels—I know it is richer than my butcher’s profit. Yet how could I covet rank and salary and thereby cause my lord to bear the reputation of reckless bestowal? I dare not accept. I wish only to return to my butcher’s stall.” Thereupon he declined the offer.

Yuan Xian dwelt in Lu, in a walled hut of one rod square, thatched with living grass. The door of woven mugwort was incomplete, its hinge made of mulberry wood. A single room had a window of broken jars, patched with coarse cloth. Rain leaked through above, moisture seeped below, yet he sat upright and plucked the zither.

(Note: Yuan Xian was a disciple of Confucius, surnamed Yuan, given name Si, style Xian. A walled space of one rod on each side is called a “walled hut,” like a room of one square zhang. Covering a roof with grass is called “thatching.” Coarse cloth is called “he.” “Upright” means proper. Yuan Xian was poor, his room no more than a walled hut, thatched with grass, its hinge of mulberry wood, its door of mugwort. A broken jar served as a window. Husband and wife each occupied one room; when rain came, the floor grew damp, yet he played the zither for his own delight, knowing fate and content in poverty—this was his way.)

Zi Gong rode a grand horse, his inner robe deep blue and his outer robe white, his high carriage too wide for the lane, as he went to visit Yuan Xian.

(Note: Zi Gong was a disciple of Confucius, named Ci, skilled in speech and fond of splendor. His carriage canopy was white silk lined with deep blue, his horse and carriage so tall and broad that the lane could not accommodate them.)

Yuan Xian wore a hat of birch bark and slippers of untanned leather, leaned on a staff of bramble, and answered the door himself.

(Note: “Slippers” means worn shoes. He made his hat from birch bark, used a bramble staff, and, having no servant, answered the door himself.)

Zi Gong said: “Alas! Master, what ails you?”

Yuan Xian replied: “I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty, while to study yet fail to practice is called ailment. Now I am poor, not ailing.”

Zi Gong stepped back, his face flushed with shame.

(Note: “Alas” is an exclamation of surprise. “Stepped back” describes his retreating manner. Confronted with frugality after extravagance, he felt ashamed.)

Yuan Xian smiled and said: “To act in hope of worldly favor, to make friends through cliques, to study for others’ sake, to teach for one’s own gain, to use benevolence and righteousness as a cloak for wickedness, to adorn oneself with carriages and horses—these are things I cannot bear to do.”

(Note: “Wickedness” means deceit. “Adorn” means embellishment. To chase worldly trends, to curry favor with cliques, to seek fame through study, to profit from teaching, to feign benevolence and righteousness for deceit, to flaunt carriages and horses—these are things a gentleman finds shameful and cannot bear to do.)

When Master Zeng dwelt in Wei, his padded robe had no outer layer, his complexion was rough and chapped, his hands and feet calloused.

(Note: His robe was stuffed with hemp, with no outer covering. “Rough and chapped” means weathered. Constant labor left his hands and feet calloused.)

For three days he did not light a fire, for ten years he did not make new clothes. When he straightened his hat, its cord snapped; when he grasped his lapel, his elbow showed; when he put on his shoes, the heels split.

(Note: Living in humble integrity, his household was impoverished. For three days he did not cook, for ten years he did not sew. The cord of his hat broke when he adjusted it; his sleeve tore when he grasped his lapel; his shoes split when he put them on.)

Yet as he dragged his hem and sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filled heaven and earth, as if issuing from metal and stone. The Son of Heaven could not make him a subject, nor could the feudal lords make him a friend.

(Note: His singing of the *Odes of Shang* was resonant and forceful, its meaning profound and vast, harmonizing with heaven and earth. His voice was pure and clear, attuned to metal and stone. His noble character transcended worldly rank, so the Son of Heaven could not employ him, nor the feudal lords befriend him.)

Thus, he who nurtures his will forgets his form; he who nurtures his form forgets profit; he who attains the Dao forgets his mind.

The scholar who guards his health does not harm his life for profit; the one who attains the Dao forgets the art of knowing through the mind.

Confucius said to Yan Hui, "Come here. Your family is poor and your station low—why do you not enter official service?"
Yan Hui replied, "I do not wish to serve. Beyond the outer wall, I have fifty *mu* of fields, enough to provide gruel and porridge; within the wall, ten *mu*, enough to yield silk and hemp. Playing the zither suffices for my amusement, and what I have learned of your Dao is enough for my joy. I do not wish to serve."
Confucius’s expression changed solemnly as he said, "Excellent is Hui’s resolve! I have heard that he who knows contentment does not burden himself with profit, and he who truly possesses himself is not dismayed by loss. He whose conduct is cultivated within feels no shame at lacking rank. I have long recited these words, but only now, through Hui, do I see them realized—this is my gain."

Prince Mou of Zhongshan said to Zhanzi, "Though my body dwells by rivers and seas, my heart lingers beneath the gates of Wei—what is to be done?"
Zhanzi replied, "Value life. When life is valued, profit becomes light."
Prince Mou of Zhongshan said, "Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself."
Zhanzi said, "If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow your nature—why should the spirit resent it? He who cannot overcome himself yet forcibly resists is doubly wounded. Such a doubly wounded man belongs not to the company of the long-lived."
Wei Mou was the son of a lord of ten thousand chariots; that he could withdraw to caves and cliffs was more difficult than for a commoner. Though he had not yet attained the Dao, he may be said to have grasped its intent.

Confucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. His gruel was made of wild greens without grain, his complexion wan and weary, yet he strummed the zither and sang in his chamber.
As Yan Hui picked vegetables, Zilu and Zigong said to one another, "The Master was twice exiled from Lu, his traces erased in Wei, his tree felled in Song, reduced to hardship in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai. Those who would kill him incur no blame; those who would trample him face no prohibition. Yet he never ceases his zither and song—can a gentleman be so shameless?"
Yan Hui could not respond and went in to tell Confucius. Confucius pushed aside the zither and sighed deeply, saying, "You and Ci are petty men. Summon them, and I will speak to them."
Zilu and Zigong entered.

Zilu said, "In such straits, one may truly be called destitute."
Confucius replied, "What words are these? The gentleman who is at one with the Dao is called 'at one'; he who is cut off from the Dao is called 'destitute.' Now I, Qiu, embrace the Dao of humaneness and rightness, yet encounter the calamities of a disordered age—how can I be called destitute? Thus, I look within and am not cut off from the Dao; I face adversity and do not lose my virtue. When the bitter cold arrives and frost and snow descend, it is then I know the flourishing of the pine and cypress. The straits of Chen and Cai—are they not a blessing for me?"

Confucius then crisply turned back to his zither and resumed his strumming and song, while Zilu, roused, took up his shield and danced. Zigong said, "I knew not the height of heaven nor the depth of earth! The ancients who attained the Dao found joy in adversity and joy in prosperity. What they rejoiced in was not adversity or prosperity, but the presence of virtue and power. Thus, adversity and prosperity are but the sequence of cold and heat, wind and rain."

For Xu You found delight by the Ying River, and Gong Bo found fulfillment on Qiu Peak. When Shun offered the world to his friend, the Northerner Wuze, Wuze said, "How strange is this ruler’s conduct! Dwelling in the furrows of the fields, yet frequenting Yao’s gate. Not content with this, he now seeks to sully me with his shameful conduct. I am ashamed to see him."

Thus he cast himself into the Clear and Cold Abyss.

Confucius said: "The scholar whose will is set upon benevolence will sacrifice his life to transform others, but will not seek survival at the cost of benevolence." Those whose aspirations soar toward purity and transcendence, whose lofty conduct distances them from the world, stand apart from those who drown their lives in the pursuit of profit—such is the distinction ordained by heaven and earth.

The man of the north was named Wuze, a friend of Shun. *Hou* means "ruler." The raised part of a field is called a *mu*; the furrow is called a *quan*. The Clear and Cold Abyss lies within the borders of Xie County in Nanyang. Shun tilled the land at Mount Li, grew up among the furrows, and frequented the gates of Yao, receiving Yao’s abdication—were his deeds not thus? Yet he sought to smear me with his shameful conduct. Overcome with humiliation, Wuze cast himself into the Clear and Cold Abyss.

When Tang was about to strike down Jie, he consulted Bian Sui, who said, "This is not my affair." Tang asked, "Who, then, is fit for it?" Bian Sui replied, "I do not know." Tang then consulted Wu Guang, who said, "This is not my affair." Tang asked, "Who, then, is fit for it?"

Wu Guang replied, "I do not know." Tang asked, "What of Yi Yin?" Wu Guang said, "He is strong and enduring, able to bear disgrace—beyond that, I know nothing."

[Commentary] Bian was the surname, Sui the given name; Wu was the surname, Guang the given name. Both were men who embraced the Dao, recluses. Tang, recognizing their worth, consulted them on his plans. Since such matters were not the business of recluses, they answered that they did not know. Yi was the surname, Yin the given name, Zhi the courtesy name—a worthy man who aided the age. *Ren* means "to endure"; *gou* means "disgrace." To halt the use of arms, one requires a man of great strength; to slay a ruler, one needs a man who can bear shame. As for his other abilities, I know nothing of them.

Thereupon, Tang and Yi Yin plotted to strike down Jie, and succeeded. Tang then offered the throne to Bian Sui, who declined, saying: "When you plotted against Jie, you consulted me—you must have thought me a villain. Now that you have defeated Jie and offer me the throne, you must think me greedy. I live in an age of chaos, and a man without the Way has twice sought to smear me with his shameful conduct. I cannot bear to hear such things again." He then cast himself into the Chou River and died.

[Commentary] *Man* means "to smear." The Chou River lies within the borders of Yingchuan Prefecture. The character is also written as *tong*.

Tang then offered the throne to Wu Guang, saying: "The wise devise the plan, the martial carry it out, and the benevolent take the throne—this is the Way of antiquity."

"Why do you not take the throne yourself?" Wu Guang declined, saying: "To depose a ruler is not righteous; to kill the people is not benevolent. Others bear the hardship, while I enjoy the gain—this is not integrity."

[Commentary] *Enjoy* means "to receive." *Depose a ruler* refers to the banishment of Jie. *Kill the people* refers to the warfare. *Others bear the hardship* means suffering execution. *I enjoy the gain* means receiving emoluments. I have heard it said: one who does not act righteously does not accept its emoluments; in an age without the Way, one does not tread its soil—how much less would I accept such an honor? I cannot bear to witness this any longer." He then carried a stone and drowned himself in the Lu River.

[Annotation] An old account says: "Those like Bian Sui and Wu Guang regarded the world as beyond the six directions, something others could not comprehend." This is mistaken. One who treats the world lightly cannot hold anything in esteem; if nothing is held in esteem, there is no cause for which to die. To regard the world as beyond the six directions is to leave it to the likes of Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu. Detached and unencumbered, they drift with the multitude, unconcerned with gain or loss—why would they cast themselves away? If these two men are to be praised, it is for their pursuit of fame and admiration of loftiness, not for placing the world beyond their concern.

[Commentary] The Lu River lies within the borders of Beiping Prefecture in Liaoxi. When the Zhou arose, there were two gentlemen dwelling in Guzhu, named Boyi and Shuqi. The two said to each other: "We have heard there is a man in the west who seems to possess the Way. Let us go and observe him."

[Commentary] Guzhu was a state in Liaoxi. Boyi and Shuqi, brothers who yielded their right to the throne, heard that King Wen possessed the Way, so they went to observe him. The deeds of Boyi and Shuqi have already been explained in the *Outer Chapters*. When they reached Qiyang, King Wu heard of them and sent Shu Dan to meet them. He made a covenant with them, saying: "I will raise your rank two grades and appoint you to an official post." They smeared the covenant with sacrificial blood and buried it.

[Commentary] Qiyang is the southern side of Mount Qi, where King Wen established his capital—now Fufeng. The Duke of Zhou, named Dan, was King Wu’s younger brother, hence called Shu Dan. At that time, King Wen had already passed, and King Wu had ascended the throne. Preparing to strike down Zhou, he sought to win over worthy men, so he sent the Duke of Zhou to make a covenant with them, promising to raise their emoluments two grades and appoint them to an official rank. They smeared the covenant with sacrificial blood and buried it beneath the altar. The two men looked at each other and laughed, saying: "Hah! How strange! This is not what we call the Way."

In ancient times, when Shennong ruled the world, his seasonal sacrifices were performed with utmost reverence yet without prayers for blessings. In his dealings with the people, he was loyal and trustworthy, governing to perfection without seeking anything in return.

When joy governed the administration, it was true governance; when joy governed the order, it was true order. He did not complete himself through others’ ruin, nor exalt himself through others’ lowliness, nor profit himself through the opportunities of the age.

Now, seeing the chaos of Yin, Zhou hastily established its rule. Those above schemed while those below traded in bribes; they relied on military force to preserve their might, slaughtered sacrificial animals to swear covenants as pledges of trust, flaunted their conduct to please the masses, and resorted to killing and warfare to seize advantage—this is but replacing one form of chaos with another.

I have heard that the scholars of old, when encountering an age of order, did not shirk their duties; when facing an age of disorder, they did not cling to mere survival. Today, the world is in turmoil, and Zhou’s virtue has declined. To align myself with Zhou would only sully my conduct—better to withdraw and preserve my integrity.

The two men journeyed north to Mount Shouyang, where they ultimately starved to death. As for Boyi and Shuqi, when it came to wealth and rank, if it could be avoided, they would never rely upon it. With lofty principles and unyielding conduct, they rejoiced in their own resolve, refusing to serve the world—such was the integrity of these two scholars.

The overarching intent of this passage is to inspire a spirit of noble yielding and distant retreat. Those touched by this ethos—even the greedy and grasping, who ride the celestial thoroughfares and enter the imperial courts—may yet sigh in mid-journey, let alone ordinary men. Thus, the likes of Yi and Xu are worthy to stand alongside Hou Ji and Yi Yin, to be compared with Yi and Lü.

Those who dwell in mountain valleys yet magnify the world—though they may not all become sagely ministers, are they not still loftier than those mired in dust and grime? Their deeds may be difficult to emulate, yet their influence is less prone to corruption, and thus worthy of transmission.

It is asked: Where does the true value of Yi and Xu lie?
It is said: The flaw of Xu You lies in leading men to feign yielding in pursuit of advancement, culminating in the likes of Zihuai. The legacy of Boyi, however, emboldens tyrannical rulers to unleash their poison without fear of resistance. The flaw of Yi and Lü lies in emboldening the world’s greedy and ambitious to dare usurpation and rebellion. Only the sage leaves no trace, and thus incurs no flaw.

If Yi and Lü are deemed the sage’s path of advancement, then Boyi and Shuqi are also the sage’s trace. If Boyi and Shuqi are not the sage’s trace, then the deeds of Yi and Lü are likewise not those of a sage.

The sage follows the natural course of things, leaving no trace. Thus, the so-called sage is one who fundamentally leaves no trace—things attain their trace, and when a trace is attained, the name "sage" is forcibly applied. Therefore, the sage is but the name for one who leaves no trace.

*Annotations to the Nan Hua True Scripture*, Scroll Thirty-One
Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan

**Exegesis by Tang Dynasty Master Cheng Xuanying of Xihua on the Miscellaneous Chapters**
*Chapter Twenty-Nine: "Robber Zhi"*

Confucius was a friend of Liuxia Ji. Liuxia Ji’s younger brother was named Dao Wei. Robber Zhi led a band of nine thousand men, rampaging across the world, invading and oppressing the feudal lords. They broke into chambers and pried open doors, drove off people’s oxen and horses, and seized their wives and daughters. Greed made them forget their kin; they paid no heed to parents or brothers and did not offer sacrifices to their ancestors. Wherever they passed, the great states fortified their cities, the small states took refuge in their strongholds, and the myriad people suffered under them.

**[Exegesis]**
His surname was Zhan, given name Qin, courtesy name Ji. He received his fief at Liuxia, hence he was called Liuxia Ji. It is also said that he dwelled beneath a willow tree, and thus took it as his sobriquet. Zhan Qin lived during the reign of Duke Zhuang of Lu, over a hundred years after Confucius—yet they are spoken of as friends, for this is a parable.

Zhi was the name of Qin’s younger brother, who was ever a great robber, hence the name Robber Zhi. They tunneled through chambers and loosed door pivots to seize people’s oxen and horses. Some versions write this as *kong* (empty) or *qu* (drive).

A *bao* was a small walled town. The harm he wrought was so vast that the common folk were utterly afflicted.

Confucius said to Liuxia Ji: “As a father, one must be able to instruct one’s son; as an elder brother, one must be able to teach one’s younger brother. If a father cannot admonish his son, nor an elder brother teach his younger brother, then the bond of father and son, elder and younger brother, is worthless. Now, sir, you are a man of talent in this age, yet your younger brother is Robber Zhi, a scourge upon the world, and you have not been able to teach him. I am secretly ashamed for you. Allow me to go and persuade him on your behalf.”

Liuxia Ji replied: “You say that a father must be able to instruct his son, and an elder brother must be able to teach his younger brother. But if a son will not heed his father’s admonitions, nor a younger brother accept his elder brother’s teachings, what can even your eloquence accomplish? Moreover, Zhi is such a man: his mind surges like a spring, his thoughts scatter like the whirlwind. His strength suffices to repel foes, his eloquence suffices to gloss over wrongs. He is pleased when his will is followed, enraged when it is crossed, and easily provoked by words. You must not go.”

Confucius would not listen. Yan Hui drove the carriage, and Zigong stood at his right. They went to see Robber Zhi, who was then resting his troops on the southern slope of Mount Tai, mincing human livers to eat.

**[Exegesis]**
*Bū* means “to eat.” Zigong verified the carriage, standing at its right.

Confucius alighted and stepped forward. He addressed the herald, saying: “I, Kong Qiu of Lu, have heard of the general’s lofty virtue and come with respect to bow twice before the herald.” The herald went in to announce him. When Robber Zhi heard this, he flew into a great rage. His eyes blazed like stars, his hair bristled to lift his cap. He said: “Is this not that crafty, deceitful man Kong Qiu of Lu? Tell him this: You fabricate words and invent phrases, falsely invoking Kings Wen and Wu. You wear a cap like a tree’s branches and gird yourself with the flanks of a dead ox. You spout a torrent of specious arguments, eating without tilling, clothing yourself without weaving. You flap your lips and wag your tongue, stirring up right and wrong to delude the lords of the world, so that scholars everywhere abandon their roots and recklessly perform filial piety and brotherly respect in hopes of attaining enfeoffment and riches. You have traveled endlessly to seek office, and Jie Yu mocked you with his song of the phoenix. You have forsaken your origins and lingered in vain pursuits, and Shi Jin ridiculed you with his metaphor of the straw dog. Your crimes are grave and weighty. Flee at once, or I shall add your liver to my evening meal.”

Confucius sent word again: “I am fortunate to be counted a friend of your elder brother. I wish only to gaze upon the hem of your tent.”

**[Exegesis]**
He meant: “I am most fortunate to be a friend of your worthy elder brother. I dare not look directly upon your countenance but wish only to tread beneath the edge of your tent.” Some versions write this as *qí* (footprint). *Qí* means the mark of a footstep. “To tread in your footsteps” is like saying “to look upon your feet.”

The herald relayed this message. Robber Zhi said: “Let him come forward.” Confucius hastened forward, stepped back from his mat, and bowed twice to Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi was enraged. He stretched out his legs, gripped his sword, glared fiercely, and roared like a nursing tiger: “Come closer, Qiu. If your words please me, you shall live; if they cross me, you shall die.”

Confucius said: “I have heard that there are three virtues in the world: To be born and grow tall, surpassingly handsome and peerless, so that young and old, high and low, all delight in seeing you—this is the highest virtue. To comprehend the workings of Heaven and Earth and distinguish all things—this is the middle virtue. To be fierce, resolute, and bold, gathering troops and leading armies—this is the lowest virtue. Whoever possesses even one of these virtues is fit to face south and call himself ‘Solitary.’ Now, General, you possess all three: your body stands eight feet and two inches tall, your face and eyes radiate light, your lips are as bright as cinnabar, your teeth are as even as rows of cowrie shells, your voice rings like the Yellow Bell, yet you are called Robber Zhi. I am secretly ashamed for you and urge you to reconsider.”

The Yellow Bell is one of the six pitch-pipes. If you, General, are willing to heed my counsel, I shall journey south to Wu and Yue, north to Qi and Lu, east to Song and Wei, and west to Jin and Chu, to have a great city of several hundred *li* built for you, with a settlement of hundreds of thousands of households, and to honor you as a feudal lord. Together with the world, we shall begin anew, disband your troops, rest your soldiers, gather and nurture your brothers, and jointly worship our ancestors. This is the conduct of a sage and a man of talent, and the wish of all under Heaven.

Robber Zhi retorted: "Come forward, Qiu! Those who can be swayed by profit or admonished by words are but the foolish and vulgar masses. As for my towering stature and striking beauty, which delight all who see me—these are the legacy of my parents’ virtue. Though you do not praise me, do I not know myself? Moreover, I have heard that those who flatter others to their faces are also wont to slander them behind their backs. Now you tell me of great cities and teeming multitudes—this is but to entice me with profit and treat me as a commoner to be herded. How could such a thing endure?

A great city cannot last forever. The greatest of cities is none other than the realm itself. Yao and Shun ruled all under Heaven, yet their descendants had not even a foothold to call their own. Tang and Wu ascended as Son of Heaven, yet their posterity was cut off and extinguished. Was this not because the profit was too great?

Furthermore, I have heard that in ancient times, beasts were many and men were few. Thus, the people dwelled in nests to avoid them, gathering acorns by day and roosting in trees by night. They were called the people of the Nest-Builder. In those days, the people knew not clothing; they piled up firewood in summer and warmed themselves by it in winter. They were called the people who knew how to live. In the age of Shennong, they lay at ease and rose content, knowing only their mothers and not their fathers, dwelling among the elk and deer. They tilled the soil to eat and wove to clothe themselves, harboring no thought of harming one another. This was the height of perfect virtue. Yet even the Yellow Emperor could not uphold such virtue: he fought Chiyou on the plains of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao and Shun arose and established a multitude of ministers.

Tang exiled his lord—[exiled Jie to Nanchao]—while King Wu killed Zhou—[the battle at Chaoge]. Thereafter, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many tyrannized the few. Since the time of Tang and Wu, all have been men of disorder—[their conquests and usurpations, Tang and Wu most egregious]. Now you cultivate the Way of Wen and Wu, wielding the world’s discourse to instruct later generations—[Confucius modeled himself on Wen and Wu, expounding on benevolence and righteousness to teach posterity]. Clad in sewn robes and narrow sashes, you utter artful words and feign virtuous conduct to delude the lords of the world, seeking only wealth and rank. No thief is greater than you. Why does the world not call you "Robber Qiu" and instead call me "Robber Zhi"?

You used honeyed words to persuade Zilu to follow you, making him remove his towering cap and lay aside his long sword to receive your teachings. The world all says that Confucius can quell violence and forbid wrongdoing—[the towering cap and long sword were the attire of the brave]. Once he submitted to your teachings, he cast them aside. In the end, Zilu sought to kill the lord of Wei but failed, and his body was minced upon the eastern gate of Wei. This was the result of your inadequate instruction—[Zhong You’s hatred of evil ran deep; his attempt to kill the Wei lord, Ju Ji, failed, and he was hacked to pieces. Robber Zhi thus mocked him].

Do you consider yourself a man of talent and a sage? Yet you were twice exiled from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged in Chen and Cai, and found no refuge in the world. You taught Zilu to meet this fate—unable to preserve himself above or benefit others below. Is your Way truly worthy of esteem?

Of those the world exalts, none surpasses the Yellow Emperor, yet even he could not uphold perfect virtue. He fought on the plains of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao was unfilial—[he did not pass the throne to his son, Dan Zhu]. Shun was undutiful—[his father despised him]. Yu was afflicted with hemiplegia—[his toil in governing the waters, enduring wind and rain, left him with a paralyzed half-body]. Tang exiled his lord, King Wu slew Zhou, and King Wen was imprisoned at Youli—[Youli, a prison of Yin. King Wen suffered Zhou’s calamity, confined for nearly seven years before escaping]. These six—[the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, and King Wen]—are those the world reveres. Yet upon examination, all were deluded by profit, violently distorting their true natures. Their conduct was deeply shameful—[these six, coveting the throne, strayed from the true Way and acted contrary to nature, thus deserving shame].

The world calls the worthies Boyi and Shuqi. Boyi and Shuqi—[the two]—renounced the rulership of Guzhu and starved to death on Mount Shouyang, their flesh and bones left unburied. Bao Jiao adorned his conduct to condemn the age and died embracing a tree—[the two perished on the mountain, leaving no descendants to bury them. His surname was Bao, given name Jiao, a recluse of the Zhou era. He refined his conduct to criticize the world, maintaining integrity and purity. He carried firewood and gathered faggots, subsisting on acorns, leaving no heirs. He would not serve the Son of Heaven nor befriend the feudal lords. When Zigong encountered him, he said: "I have heard that one who opposes a ruler’s governance should not tread upon his land, and one who defiles his lord should not accept his benefits. Now you tread upon this land and eat its bounty—is this permissible?" Bao Jiao replied: "I have heard that the steadfast scholar values advancement and scorns retreat, while the worthy feels shame easily and disdains death." He then embraced a tree and withered where he stood]. Shentu Di remonstrated but was not heeded; he carried a stone and cast himself into the river, where he was devoured by fish and turtles—[Shentu drowned himself; this was explained in an earlier passage. That he "remonstrated but was not heeded" lacks clear evidence; Cui’s commentary, though extensive, offers no definitive explanation].

Jie Zitui was the very model of loyalty: he cut flesh from his thigh to feed Duke Wen. Later, the duke betrayed him, and Zitui, enraged, departed and burned to death embracing a tree—[Duke Wen of Jin, Chong’er, fled the calamity of Li Ji and wandered abroad. On the road, starving, Zitui cut flesh from his thigh to feed him. Three days after the duke’s return, he rewarded his followers but forgot Zitui. Zitui composed the *Song of the Dragon and Serpent* and wrote it upon the duke’s gate, then fled in anger. The duke later felt remorse and pursued Zitui to Mount Jie. Zitui hid, so the duke set fire to the mountain, hoping he would flee. When the flames reached him, Zitui embraced a tree and burned to death]. Weisheng arranged to meet a woman beneath a bridge. When she did not come, the waters rose, but he would not leave. He embraced a bridge pillar and drowned.

These six—[Boyi, Shuqi, Bao Jiao, Shentu Di, Jie Zitui, and Weisheng]—differed not from dismembered dogs, drifting swine, or beggars clutching gourds. All pursued fame and scorned death, heedless of nurturing life’s root—[these six, failing to align with the profound Way, feigned conduct to stand apart from the world, seeking reputation to transmit to later ages. How do they differ from a dog torn apart, a pig adrift in the water, or a destitute man begging with a gourd? Such figures are not worthy of mention, yet the conduct of these six is no different. All valued fame over life, neglecting to return to the root and nourish their allotted span]. Some texts write "swine" as "death" and "run" as "beg"—read according to the character.

"Zuo shi" means "swine." Those whom the world calls loyal ministers—none surpass Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu. Zixu drowned in the river, Bigan had his heart carved out; these two, the world calls loyal ministers, yet in the end they were mocked by all under heaven.

From the perspective of one who has attained the Dao, even Zixu and Bigan are not worthy of esteem. What Confucius tells me—if he speaks of ghostly matters, I cannot know them; if he speaks of human affairs, it goes no further than this, all of which I have heard and understood. Now I tell you of human nature: the eye desires to see beauty, the ear to hear sound, the mouth to savor flavor, and the will to reach fulfillment.

Human life spans a hundred years at its longest, eighty in middle age, sixty at its shortest. Subtracting days lost to illness, emaciation, death, mourning, and sorrow, the time one opens their mouth to laugh amounts to no more than four or five days in a month. Heaven and earth are without end, but human death comes at its appointed time. Clutching this finite vessel and entrusting it to the boundless, one passes in an instant—no different from a swift steed galloping past a crack in the wall.

Those who cannot delight their will and nurture their allotted span are not those who comprehend the Dao. What Confucius says is all that I reject. Hurry, leave, and return—do not speak of it again. Your Way is frantic and insatiable, a craft of deceit and pretense, incapable of preserving truth. What is there to discuss?

Confucius bowed twice, hastened away, exited the gate, mounted his carriage, and three times lost hold of the reins. His eyes stared blankly, seeing nothing; his complexion was ashen, like the dead. Leaning against the crossbar, he hung his head, unable to catch his breath.

Upon returning to the eastern gate of Lu, he encountered Liuxia Ji. Liuxia Ji said, "Lately, you have been absent for several days, and your carriage bears signs of travel. Might you have gone to see Zhi?" Confucius looked to the sky and sighed, "Yes."

Liuxia Ji asked, "Did Zhi perhaps offend you as I warned before?" Confucius replied, "He did. I am what one might call one who moxibusts without illness—running to stroke a tiger’s head, braiding its whiskers, nearly escaping the tiger’s jaws."

Zizhang asked Mangou De, "Why not practice virtuous conduct?" Mangou De replied, "One without shame grows rich; one who speaks much gains prominence. The greatest of fame and profit lies in shamelessness and glibness. Thus, when one observes reputation and calculates profit, sincerity is truly the way."

If one abandons fame and profit, it runs counter to the heart. Therefore, the conduct of a scholar cannot go a single day without such pursuits.

Mangou De said, "The shameless grow wealthy, the voluble gain renown. The greatest of fame and profit nearly rests in shamelessness and glibness. Thus, when one observes reputation and calculates profit, glibness is truly the way."

If one abandons fame and profit, turning inward to the heart, then the conduct of a scholar embraces their Heavenly nature.

To embrace is to hold fast; Heavenly refers to the natural. The scholar who cultivates the Dao, establishing conduct and renouncing fame and profit, goes against the common heart, yet by holding fast to Heavenly truth, they align with the profound and mysterious Way.

Zizhang said: "In ancient times, Jie and Zhou were honored as Sons of Heaven, possessing all under Heaven. Yet if one were to say to a hoarder or thief, 'Your conduct is like Jie and Zhou’s,' they would flush with shame and harbor resentment—such is the disdain of petty men. Confucius and Mo Di, though impoverished commoners, if one were to say to a prime minister, 'Your conduct is like Confucius and Mo Di’s,' they would alter their expression and demeanor, declaring themselves unworthy—such is the true nobility of the scholar."

Jie, Zhou, Confucius, and Mo Di have all been discussed earlier. *Zang* refers to slaves; *ju* refers to thieves, the petty men of banditry. To compare a gentleman to a slave is to provoke shame and defiance; to compare a prime minister to a commoner is to elicit a change in countenance and joyful humility.

Thus, one knows that what is noble lies in conduct, not in rank. Therefore, though one may hold the power of the Son of Heaven, this does not necessarily make one noble; though one may be impoverished as a commoner, this does not necessarily make one base. The distinction between noble and base rests in the goodness or evil of one’s conduct.

This further explicates the preceding meaning. *Man Goude* said: “Petty thieves are imprisoned, while great thieves become feudal lords—yet at the gates of such lords, righteous scholars still dwell.” In ancient times, Duke Huan of Qi, Xiaobai, killed his elder brother and took his sister-in-law, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister. Tian Chengzi once murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted his gifts. In speech, they are condemned as base; in action, they are deferred to—thus, the true sentiments of words and deeds wage war within the breast. Is this not perverse?

*Bei* means contrary; *fu* means perverse. Duke Huan of Qi, named Xiaobai, killed his elder brother, Zifu, and took his sister-in-law. Guan Zhong, a worthy man, served and aided him, ultimately uniting the feudal lords nine times and rectifying all under Heaven. Tian Chengzi murdered Duke Jian of Qi, yet Confucius, having bathed and dressed in court robes, accepted his worn silk. To kill one’s elder brother and take one’s sister-in-law, to murder one’s lord and usurp the state—no greater evil exists in human relations. Yet Yiwu served as minister, and the Master accepted his gifts. In speech, they are deemed vile and base; in conduct, they are humbly served. Is this not a war within the heart, a contradiction between words and deeds? Thus, the *Book* says: “Who is evil? Who is good? The successful become the head; the unsuccessful, the tail.”

The successful are made leaders and served; the unsuccessful are made tails and reviled. By this reasoning, it is only success or failure that matters, not whether one’s conduct is virtuous or not—thus, one cannot truly know who is good or evil. The *Book* cited has been lost to the fires, and no copies remain.

Zizhang said: “If one does not act with virtue, then kinship and estrangement will lack principle, noble and base will lack righteousness, elder and younger will lack order. How, then, can the Five Bonds and Six Positions be distinguished?”

*Qi* means kinship; *lun* means principle. The Five Bonds refer to grandfather, father, self, son, and grandson—or the Five Phases: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—and the Five Virtues: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. The Six Positions refer to ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife—or father, mother, elder brother, younger brother, husband, and wife. Zizhang said: “If one does not practice the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, then kinship and estrangement will lack principle, noble and base will lack righteousness, elder and younger will lack order, and the Five Bonds and Six Positions will have no means of distinction.”

*Man Goude* said: “Yao killed his eldest son; Shun exiled his younger brother of the same mother—where is the principle in kinship and estrangement?” Yao deposed his eldest son, Dan Zhu, denying him the throne—some say he killed him. Shun enfeoffed his younger brother, Xiang, in the state of Youbi, commanding the officials of all under Heaven to govern his land and collect his tribute—thus, it is called exile. In deposing a son and exiling a brother, where is the principle of kinship and estrangement? “Tang exiled Jie; King Wu killed Zhou—where is the righteousness in noble and base?” King Tang of Yin exiled the Xia tyrant Jie to Nanchao; King Wu of Zhou killed the Yin tyrant Zhou at Jijun—where is the righteousness in the distinction between ruler and minister, noble and base? “King Ji was the rightful heir, yet the Duke of Zhou killed his elder brother—where is the order in elder and younger?” King Ji was the youngest son of King Tai, father of King Wen. Taibo and Zhongyong yielded the throne and did not claim it, so the younger son, Jili, was made the rightful heir. The Duke of Zhou’s elder brothers, Guan and Cai, wept as they were executed—thus, it is said he killed them. In deposing the rightful heir and establishing a younger son, in a younger brother killing his elder brother—where is the order in seniority and rank? “The Confucians speak with hypocritical words; the Mohists practice universal love—how, then, can the Five Bonds and Six Positions be distinguished?” The Confucians often speak grandly, fabricating names and ranks; the Mohists practice impartial love, universal and without partiality—how can the Five Bonds and Six Positions be distinguished?

“Moreover, you rectify for the sake of reputation; I rectify for the sake of profit. In truth, neither reputation nor profit accords with principle or reflects the Dao.” *Jian* means clarity, perception. What Zizhang pursues is rectitude for the sake of reputation; what *Goude* pursues is rectitude for the sake of profit. Yet both paths of reputation and profit are not truly real—they violate the highest principle and fail to perceive the profound Dao.

“I daily debate with you before *Wu Yue*: the petty man dies for wealth; the gentleman dies for reputation. Though the emotions they alter and the natures they change differ, when it comes to abandoning what they do and dying for what they do not do, they are the same.” *Song* means to discourse; *yue* means a covenant. To abandon what one does is to forsake the self; to die for what one does not do is to pursue externals. To die for profit is called petty; to die for reputation is called noble—yet though reputation and profit differ, what they die for is the same.

Zizhang and *Goude* both discussed the profound words of non-action and the principle of effortless harmony, deepening their bond of mutual understanding. Thus it is said: “For the petty man to practice non-action is to turn back and die for Heaven; for the gentleman to practice non-action is to follow Heaven’s principle.” *Er* means “you.” Neither pursuing profit nor dying for reputation, one can follow one’s nature and return to the root, uniting with the Dao of spontaneity.

“Whether crooked or straight, assist and reach Heaven’s extremity; face the four directions and ebb and flow with the seasons.” *Xiang* means to assist. Without questioning crooked or straight, follow the Dao of spontaneity, observe the four directions, and move with the waxing and waning of the seasons. “Whether right or wrong, grasp the revolving mechanism; stand alone in intent and wander with the Dao.” *Paihuai* means to transform one’s intent. *Yuanji* means the center of the ring. Grasp the Dao of the revolving center to respond to right and wrong; employ the mind of solitary transformation to fulfill one’s intent—thus can one darkly comprehend the principle of emptiness and penetration, transforming without end.

Do not act with contrivance, nor establish virtue with deliberation, lest you lose what you seek to accomplish. The *Commentary* states: What you seek to accomplish is your true nature. Do not turn your will toward the conduct of sagely traces; do not perfect your heart in the learning of benevolence and righteousness. Abandoning the self to imitate others, you will lose your true nature.

Do not pursue wealth, nor strive for success, lest you forsake your Heavenly nature. The *Commentary* states: Do not rush toward wealth and honor, nor be consumed by the pursuit of success. To rush and strive is to turn away from the nature of spontaneity. Bi Gan’s heart was carved out, and Wu Zixu’s eyes were gouged—these were the calamities of loyalty. The *Commentary* states: Bi Gan remonstrated with King Zhou, who said, “I have heard that the heart of a sage has seven apertures,” and so he cut open Bi Gan’s heart to examine it. Wu Zixu remonstrated with King Fuchai, who killed him. Wu Zixu said, “After my death, gouge out my eyes and hang them on the eastern gate of Wu to witness Yue’s destruction of Wu.” These were all cases of utmost loyalty meeting with disaster.

Zhigong testified against his father, and Weisheng drowned—these were the perils of trustworthiness. The *Commentary* states: Zhigong’s father stole a sheep, and his son bore witness against him. Weisheng had arranged to meet a woman, and when she did not come, he held onto a bridge pillar and drowned. These were all cases of upholding trustworthiness leading to misfortune. Baozi stood upright until he withered, and Crown Prince Shen did not defend himself—these were the harms of integrity. The *Commentary* states: Bao Jiao was incorruptibly upright; when Zigong mocked him, he embraced a tree and stood until he withered and died. Crown Prince Shen was the eldest son of Duke Xian of Jin. When he was slandered by Lady Li, he was falsely accused and did not defend himself, hanging himself in the end.

Confucius did not see his mother, and Kuang Zhang did not see his father—these were the failures of righteousness. The *Commentary* states: Confucius was engrossed in sagely traces, traveling through states to answer summons. When his mother was on her deathbed, Confucius did not see her. Kuang Zhang, a man of Qi, remonstrated with his father, who did not heed him. Hated by his father, he traveled to another city, where he was so absorbed in studying benevolence and righteousness that he forgot to return. When his father was on his deathbed, Kuang Zhang did not see him. These were all cases of being submerged in benevolence and righteousness, leading to such faults.

These are the traditions of the upper ages and the talk of later generations, by which those who would be scholars rectify their words and verify their conduct—yet they still suffer calamity and encounter misfortune. The *Annotation* states: This chapter speaks of valuing conduct, which leads to artificiality, and esteeming scholars, which leads to pretense. Thus, one must despise conduct and belittle scholars to preserve one’s inner integrity; only then can conduct be lofty and scholars esteemed. The *Commentary* states: From Bi Gan to Kuang Zhang, all suffered disaster for their loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and uprightness. These are the traditions handed down from ancient times and the talk of later generations. Thus, those who are loyal and sincere, incorruptible and trustworthy—rectifying their words to remonstrate with their lords and verifying their conduct to serve their rulers—all encounter misfortune and suffer calamity. Those who would follow the Dao must be deeply cautious.

Wu Zu asked Zhi He: “There has never been a person who did not seek fame and pursue profit. The wealthy attract followers; followers humble themselves, and the humble are esteemed. To be humbled and esteemed is the Dao of long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment. Yet you alone have no such intention. Is your wisdom insufficient? Or do you know but lack the strength to act? Or do you deliberately reject it without forgetting?” The *Commentary* states: Wu Zu refers to those who are insatiably greedy. Zhi He refers to one who embodies the Dao of harmony, a person of integrity who knows his limits. The two are set in contrast to illustrate the fortunes and misfortunes of greed and integrity.

Wu Zu said: “No one in the world fails to seek fame and pursue profit. The wealthy attract followers; followers humble themselves and esteem them. To be humbled and esteemed brings joy to one’s nature, aligns with one’s disposition, and ensures bodily ease and longevity. Do you truly have no desire for wealth and honor? Is it that you know contentment and do not seek them? Or do you know but lack the strength to act, so you deliberately reject them without forgetting the desire for honor and gain?”

Zhi He replied: “Now, these people—those born in the same era and dwelling in the same village as oneself—consider themselves transcendent, surpassing the world. Yet they are without principle or rectitude, merely observing the times and distinguishing right from wrong, conforming to custom. The *Commentary* states: These people refer to the wealthy. The vulgar are those without wisdom, whose greed for profit is intense. Those born in the same era and dwelling in the same village as the wealthy consider themselves transcendent, surpassing the world—how much more so those who enjoy wealth and honor themselves. These are foolish people without inner guidance, who do not follow the right path. They do not perceive the eras of past and present, nor discern the boundaries of right and wrong, but compete with the dust of the world, shifting with its currents. How can they recognize the outcomes of fortune and misfortune?

They abandon what is most weighty and forsake what is most noble, all for the sake of their pursuits. How far this is from the Dao of long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment! The *Commentary* states: What is most weighty is life; what is most noble is the Dao. The vulgar abandon life and turn their backs on the Dao, acting in this way in all things. How distant they are from the Dao of long life!

The pain of sorrow and the ease of joy are not reflected in the body; the fear of alarm and the delight of happiness are not reflected in the heart. The *Commentary* states: Sorrow and joy, fear and delight are all external matters, unable to illuminate the sage’s form or penetrate the heart’s spirit. Yet the foolish act upon them blindly. They know what they do but not why they do it. Thus, though they may be honored as Son of Heaven and possess all under Heaven, they cannot escape misfortune.”

The *Commentary* states: "To act" is to engage in deliberate action; "the reason for acting" is non-action. They know only how to act through deliberate action but do not understand that the source of action lies in non-action. Such people, though they may hold the reins of ten thousand affairs and command the wealth of the four seas, cannot escape the misfortunes of alarm and dread.

Wu Zu said: Wealth, for men, is advantageous in every way. It exhausts beauty and exhausts power—what even the perfected cannot attain, what the worthy cannot match.
The *Commentary* states: To exhaust all the world’s goodness and beauty, to command all human might and influence—what is this if not wealth and nobility? Thus, even those of utmost virtue and the wisest sages cannot surpass it.

They wield the bravery and strength of others to bolster their own might, they grasp the wisdom and schemes of others to sharpen their own discernment, they rely on the virtue of others to adorn their own excellence. Though they do not rule a state, their stern authority rivals that of a sovereign or father.
The *Commentary* states: The wealthy and noble attract many to their side. Thus, the brave defend them, the wise counsel them, the virtuous assist them. Though they do not govern a realm, their majesty and severity are like those of a ruler or father—all this is brought about by the power of wealth.

Moreover, the allure of music, beauty, fine flavors, and power over men—these delight the heart without need of learning, and the body finds ease in them without need of imitation.
The *Commentary* states: The ear delights in sound, the eye in beauty, the mouth in rich flavors, and the heart in authority and influence—these please the mind without instruction, and the body finds comfort in them without following any model. Such is the nature of man.

Desire and aversion, avoidance and pursuit—these do not wait upon a teacher. This is the nature of man. Though all under heaven may reject me, who can refuse them?
The *Commentary* states: To pursue what one desires and avoid what one dislikes is the common nature of all beings. It does not require a teacher to know this. Though the world may oppose Wu Zu, who alone would dispute or reject this?

Zhi He said: The actions of the wise move in accord with the people, never transgressing their measure. Thus, contentment brings no strife, and non-action yields no seeking.
The *Commentary* states: The wise, with empty hearts, respond to things. Thus, their conduct and movements take the people’s hearts as their own. The people follow them, never transgressing the proper measure. Their minds are perfectly at ease, so they do not contend. They act without deliberate effort, so they neither seek nor perceive.

Those who lack contentment seek it, contending in all four directions yet never deeming themselves greedy. Those with surplus renounce it, casting aside the world yet never deeming themselves modest.
The *Commentary* states: The four directions are the four quarters of the earth. The distinction between the common and the sage lies in greed and modesty. Thus, they vie for the four quarters, racing across the eight wilds, never recognizing their own rapacity. They abandon the throne of the Son of Heaven, declining the ninefold dignity, yet never recognizing their own restraint. The truth of modesty and greed does not come from external pressure—it is a reflection of one’s inner measure.
The *Commentary* states: To reflect is to illuminate. The fulfillment of one’s nature is not forced by external things. When one turns inward, each follows a different measure.

They may hold the position of Son of Heaven yet not use their nobility to intimidate others; they may possess all under heaven yet not use their wealth to toy with others. They weigh the harm, consider the consequences, and see it as injurious to their nature. Thus, they decline and do not accept—not to seek fame.
The *Commentary* states: Those who do not use their lofty status to dominate or their riches to amuse do so because they calculate the disasters and fear harm to their true nature. Thus, they decline the greatest treasure and do not accept it—not to pursue reputation.

Yao and Shun ruled as emperors and brought harmony, yet this was not out of benevolence toward the world, but to avoid allowing beauty to harm their lives. Shan Juan and Xu You were offered the throne yet refused it—not out of empty humility, but to avoid allowing affairs to harm themselves. All of them pursued what benefited them and declined what harmed them. Though the world calls them worthy, they did not act to cultivate fame.
The *Commentary* states: Harmony means peace. The governance of Yao and Shun brought peace to all under heaven—not out of a desire for benevolence, but to avoid allowing splendor to harm their lives. Shan Juan and Xu You were offered the throne yet refused it—not out of false humility, but to avoid allowing worldly affairs to harm themselves. All pursued the benefit of long life and declined the harm of usurpation and strife. Thus, the world calls them worthy, and they may be said to have had this mind of avoiding harm—but they had no intention of seeking fame.

Wu Zu said: If one clings to reputation, tortures the body, rejects sweetness, and practices austerity to preserve life, one is no different from one who suffers chronic illness and endless hardship yet does not die.
The *Commentary* states: If one stubbornly seeks to cultivate reputation, torments the body, rejects sweetness, and practices strict restraint to preserve life, how is this different from one who endures long illness and unending hardship, living as if already dead?

These are the words of Wu Zu, challenging Zhi He.

Zhi He said: Balance brings fortune, while excess brings harm—this is true of all things, and wealth is the most extreme case.
The *Commentary* states: Balance brings blessings, while excess invites disaster—this is the natural principle of heaven. All things are thus, but wealth is the most extreme.

Now, the rich man’s ears are filled with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes; his mouth savors the flavors of fine meats and rich wines, stirring his mind and causing him to neglect his duties. This may be called disorder.
The *Commentary* states: To savor is to find satisfaction. Pipes and flutes are types of bamboo instruments. The wealthy indulge their passions without restraint: their mouths delight in rich wines, their ears in music, their choices clouding their minds and disturbing their senses. Their natures grow dull, their duties forgotten, and they remain unaware—is this not disorder?

Engulfed in pent-up qi, it is as if one carries a heavy burden while ascending a slope—this may be called suffering.
The *Commentary* states: Pent-up qi is akin to frustration and vexation. When greed and desire grow excessive, toil and exhaustion ensue, the heart becomes stifled, and one sinks into resentment—like climbing a steep incline with a weight upon one’s back. Such weariness—is this not suffering indeed?

Craving wealth brings only consolation, craving power brings only depletion; in stillness one drowns, in bodily ease one seethes—this may be called affliction.
The *Commentary* states: Coveting treasures to soothe the heart, scheming for authority to exhaust the mind; in quiet repose the body sinks into torpor, in physical comfort resentment arises. Whether in motion or stillness, such hardship—is this not affliction?

Driven by the desire for wealth and profit, one’s ears are filled like a wall, yet one does not know to retreat; clinging to pent-up qi without release—this may be called disgrace.
The *Commentary* states: A wall is a barrier. The craving for wealth and profit is like an insatiable abyss, akin to a wall built ever higher. The heart seethes with frustration, greed unrelenting, blind to danger—is this not shameful?

Wealth accumulates yet goes unused, clung to without release; the heart brims with vexation, the pursuit of more unceasing—this may be called sorrow.
The *Commentary* states: Vexation is distress. Hoarded yet not spent, pent-up yet not resolved, greed knows no limit, and the heart overflows with turmoil. Upon reflection—is this not sorrow?

Within, one fears the threat of plunderers; without, one dreads the harm of bandits. Doors are barred and towers fortified, one dares not venture out alone—this may be called fear.
The *Commentary* states: Fear is terror. To seek is to demand. "A man without guilt may yet be condemned for the jade he carries." Thus, at home one trembles at the thought of thieves, abroad one quakes before the threat of robbers. Gates are sealed, watchtowers erected, every entry and exit guarded, every coming and going fraught with dread—daring not walk alone. Such hardship—is this not fear?

These six—disorder, suffering, affliction, disgrace, sorrow, and fear—are the greatest harms under heaven. Yet one forgets them and fails to examine them; when calamity strikes, one exhausts one’s nature and squanders one’s wealth, and even a single day of carefree simplicity can no longer be regained.
The *Commentary* states: The six are disorder, suffering, affliction, disgrace, sorrow, and fear. To exhaust is to deplete. The greatest harms under heaven are forgotten and unexamined; when bandits suddenly strike, life hangs by a thread, a lifetime of greed undone in an instant, all wealth and treasures gone in a moment. Could one ever return to a day of humble poverty? Thus, when one looks for fame, it is nowhere to be seen; when one seeks profit, it cannot be found. Yet the mind remains entangled, still contending for these—is this not delusion?
The *Annotation* states: This chapter speaks of how those who know contentment are ever content.
The *Commentary* states: Entangled is to be ensnared. When bandits strike, one’s very body is no longer one’s own. In such a moment, where is fame or profit to be found? Yet the common folk, so utterly inverted, remain ensnared by fame and profit, their hearts set on contention. By this measure—is this not the height of delusion?

The *Southern Florescence Canon: Annotated and Subcommented* (Volume Thirty-Two)
*Annotations by Guo Xiang of Henan*
*Subcommentary by Master Cheng Xuanying of the Western Florescence, Tang Dynasty*

**Miscellaneous Chapters: "Discourse on Swords" (Chapter Thirty)**

In former times, King Wen of Zhao delighted in swords. Over three thousand swordsmen, lodging as retainers, thronged his gates, clashing day and night before him. Each year, more than a hundred perished or were wounded—yet his passion knew no satiation. Thus it continued for three years, until the state declined and the feudal lords plotted against him.

*Subcommentary:* King Hui of Zhao, named He, was the son of King Wuling. Fond of swordsmen, he maintained three thousand retainers, his desire insatiable. As his state weakened, the feudal lords, perceiving his lack of the Way, conspired together, intending to attack.

The crown prince, Kui, grew anxious and offered a reward to his attendants: "Whoever can persuade the king to abandon his fondness for swordsmen shall receive a thousand gold pieces." His attendants replied, "Zhuangzi would be capable of this."

*Subcommentary:* Kui was the name of the Zhao crown prince. Distressed by his father’s obsession with warfare, he sought to offer a thousand gold pieces to recruit a persuasive scholar. Zhuangzi, being a great worthy, would surely be able to halt the king’s passion for swords.

The crown prince then sent an emissary bearing a thousand gold pieces to present to Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi declined the gift but accompanied the emissary to see the crown prince, asking, "What instruction does the crown prince have for Zhou, and why grant him a thousand gold pieces?" The crown prince replied, "I have heard that you, Master, are enlightened and sagely. I humbly offer this thousand gold as provisions for your attendants. Since you have declined, how dare I speak further?"

*Subcommentary:* "What matter do you wish to instruct me in, that you grant a thousand gold pieces?" Since the sum was substantial, he inquired. The crown prince said, "Having heard of Zhuangzi’s wisdom and sagacity, I present this thousand gold to serve as provisions for your retinue."

Zhuangzi said, "I have heard that what the crown prince wishes to employ me for is to end the king’s fondness for swords. If I were to persuade the king against his will and fail to satisfy the crown prince, I would face execution. How then could I concern myself with gold? But if I were to persuade the king and satisfy the crown prince, what in the state of Zhao could I not obtain?" The crown prince said, "Indeed. What my father sees are only swordsmen."

Zhuangzi replied, "Very well. I am skilled in the sword." The crown prince said, "Yet the swordsmen my father favors all have disheveled hair, bristling sideburns, and drooping caps; their cords are coarse, their robes short in the back. They glare fiercely and speak with difficulty—yet the king delights in them. If you, Master, were to appear before the king in Confucian garb, the matter would surely go awry."

*Subcommentary:* Their hair was wild as withered grass, their sideburns bristling; their iron caps drooped to obscure their faces. Their cords were of coarse hemp, their robes short in the back for ease in combat. With glaring eyes and fierce expressions, their voices were harsh and grating—such was the appearance and attire of these swordsmen.

Zhuangzi said, "Permit me to prepare the attire of a swordsman." After three days of preparation, he was presented to the crown prince, who then accompanied him to see the king. The king, bare blade in hand, awaited him.

Zhuangzi entered the palace gates without haste and did not bow upon seeing the king.

*Subcommentary:* One who is self-possessed harbors no fear within, and thus does not rush.

The king said, "What instruction do you wish to offer me, that the crown prince has spoken for you first?"

*Subcommentary:* "What method do you intend to use to admonish me, that the crown prince has already spoken to me on your behalf?"

Zhuangzi replied, "I have heard that Your Majesty delights in swords, and so I have come to present myself as a swordsman." The king asked, "What ability does your sword possess to restrain others?" Zhuangzi said, "My sword can slay one man every ten paces and traverse a thousand *li* without hindrance." The king, greatly pleased, exclaimed, "There would be none in the world to rival you!"

*Subcommentary:* His sword could kill a man every ten paces and travel a thousand *li* without pause—so swift and sharp was it that none could withstand it.

Zhuangzi said, "The art of the sword lies in presenting emptiness, opening with advantage, responding after the opponent moves, and arriving first. I wish to demonstrate this." The king said, "Master, rest and retire to your lodgings. I shall issue the command and arrange a contest to invite you."

*Subcommentary:* His words were pure and far-reaching, moving the king’s heart. Thus, the king bade him rest and retire to his quarters, awaiting the arrangement of a sword contest before summoning him.

The king then assembled swordsmen for seven days. Over sixty were killed or wounded, and five or six remained. These were ordered to present their swords at the foot of the palace steps, and Zhuangzi was summoned. The king said, "Today, let us test the swordsmen and have them engage in combat."

*Subcommentary:* *Dun* means "to sever." The king wished to array the swordsmen and have them compete to determine superiority.

Zhuangzi said, "I have long awaited this."

*Subcommentary:* He had long yearned for this opportunity and requested an early trial.

The king asked, "What length of weapon does the Master wield?" Zhuangzi replied, "Any weapon I am given will suffice."

*Subcommentary:* *Yu* means "to employ." The king, recognizing Zhuangzi’s skill in swordplay, thus inquired. "Yet I possess three swords, any of which Your Majesty may employ. Permit me to describe them before demonstrating."

The king said, "I wish to hear of the three swords." Zhuangzi replied, "There is the sword of the Son of Heaven, the sword of the feudal lords, and the sword of the commoner."

The king asked, "What is the sword of the Son of Heaven like?" Zhuangzi said, "The sword of the Son of Heaven has its point forged from Yanxi and Stone Fortress, its edge from Mount Tai of Qi."

*Subcommentary:* The *feng* is the tip of the sword; the *e* is its blade. Yanxi lies in the state of Yan; Stone Fortress is a mountain beyond the frontier. These northern lands form the sword’s point. Mount Tai of Qi, in the east, serves as its blade.

"Its spine is formed by Jin and Wei, its guard by Zhou and Song."

*Subcommentary:* The *tan* is the guard. Jin and Wei, being near Zhao, form the spine. Zhou and Song, lying to the south, serve as the guard.

"The states of Han and Wei form its hilt."

*Subcommentary:* The *jia* is the handle. The states of Han and Wei lie to the west of Zhao, thus serving as the handle.

"It encompasses the Four Barbarians and enfolds the Four Seasons."

*Subcommentary:* It embraces the Four Barbarians with virtue and power, and accords with the Four Seasons in generation and transformation.

"Its blade is tempered by the Bohai Sea, its belt girded by Mount Chang."

*Subcommentary:* The Bohai Sea is Cangzhou. Mount Chang is the Northern Marchmount. Within the workings of creation, mountains and seas stabilize the land.

"It is ordered by the Five Phases, judged by punishment and virtue."

*Subcommentary:* The Five Phases are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Punishment refers to penal law; virtue, to moral transformation. By these Five Phases, the realm is governed; by punishment and virtue, all living things are guided.

"It is opened by yin and yang, sustained by spring and summer, and put into motion by autumn and winter."

*Subcommentary:* Yin and yang initiate; spring and summer uphold; autumn and winter enforce severity—such is the natural Dao.

"This sword, when thrust forward, knows no obstacle; when raised, nothing lies above it; when pressed down, nothing lies below it; when swung, nothing lies beside it. Above, it cleaves the floating clouds; below, it severs the earth’s foundations. Once this sword is employed, it rectifies the feudal lords, and all under heaven submits."

*Subcommentary:* When the sword is the Dao, nothing can contain it, for it extends without bound above, below, and on all sides. Floating clouds and earth’s foundations are but trifling matters. Since its work is that of creation itself, none dare resist. Such is the sword of the Son of Heaven."

King Wen, dazed and disoriented,

*Subcommentary:* One of limited capacity, upon hearing great truths, cannot grasp them—thus he grows dazed, as if crossing the sea, losing all sense of direction, much like King Hui of Wei upon hearing the *shao* music.

asked, "What of the sword of the feudal lords?"

Zhuangzi replied, "The sword of the feudal lords has its point forged from the wise and brave, its edge from the pure and incorruptible, its spine from the worthy and good, its guard from the loyal and sagely, and its hilt from the bold and eminent.

"This sword, too, when thrust forward, knows no obstacle; when raised, nothing lies above it; when pressed down, nothing lies below it; when swung, nothing lies beside it. Above, it models the round heavens to follow the Three Luminaries; below, it models the square earth to follow the Four Seasons; within, it harmonizes the people’s will to pacify the Four Quarters."

*Subcommentary:* The Four Quarters are the four directions. To emulate heaven and earth and comprehend the nature of all things—this is what sets the feudal lords apart. If one wields this sword to govern the state, none under heaven can withstand it. Once employed, it strikes like thunder, and within the four borders, none fail to submit and heed the ruler’s command. Such is the sword of the feudal lords."

*Subcommentary:* The *Yijing* associates the *Zhen* hexagram with the feudal lords, hence thunder symbolizes their authority.

The king asked, "What of the sword of the commoner?"

Zhuangzi replied, "The sword of the commoner is wielded by men with disheveled hair, bristling sideburns, slouching caps, tassels dangling, and short-backed robes. They glare fiercely and speak harshly, clashing before one another, slashing at necks above and piercing livers and lungs below. This sword of the commoner differs not from a cockfight—one day’s combat, and a life is lost. It serves no purpose in the affairs of state. Now, though Your Majesty occupies the throne of the Son of Heaven, you delight in the sword of the commoner. I humbly deem this unworthy of you."

*Subcommentary:* Zhuangzi’s eloquence surpasses all in ancient and modern times, and thus he persuades the King of Zhao to abandon his preference, guiding him toward the true essence of his teaching.

The king then led him up to the hall. The royal chef presented the feast, and the king circled him thrice.

*Subcommentary:* "Circled" means to encircle. The king, recognizing his own error, was deeply ashamed and remorseful. He commanded Zhuangzi to ascend the hall to express his contrition, circling the feast three times without being able to sit calmly—his breath grew labored and his heart heavy. How could he possibly eat?

Zhuangzi said: "May Your Majesty sit composed and steady your qi. The matter of the sword has now been resolved."

Thereupon, the king did not leave his palace for three months, and the swordsmen all died of resentment in their quarters.

*Subcommentary:* Having received no further rewards, they perished in bitterness.

*Beginning of the thirty-third fascicle of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Zhu Shu
*Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan*

**Commentary by Master Cheng Xuanying of Xihua on the Miscellaneous Chapters: "The Fisherman," Chapter Thirty**

Confucius wandered through the forest of black canopies and rested, seated upon the Apricot Altar. His disciples read aloud, while Confucius plucked the zither and sang, the melody not yet half-finished.

*Subcommentary:* *Zi* (缁) means black. The Master traveled the world, expounding the *Book of Songs* and the *Book of Documents*. At times, by the riverside, he would rest amid the forest’s whispers. The woods were lush and dense, their foliage blocking the sun, casting deep shade, their hanging branches like curtains—hence the name, the Forest of Black Canopies. A *tan* (坛) is an elevated place in the marsh. As apricot trees grew there in abundance, it was called the Apricot Altar. The zither embodies harmony, capable of harmonizing the heart and nurturing the nature—thus he played it.

There was a fisherman who descended from his boat and approached. His temples and brows were white as frost, his hair unbound, his sleeves swaying as he walked. He ascended the plain, stopping at the shore, his left hand resting on his knee, his right hand cradling his chin as he listened. When the song ended,

*Subcommentary:* The fisherman was Fan Li, minister to the King of Yue. Having aided King Goujian in defeating Wu, he boarded a small boat and roamed the Three Rivers and Five Lakes, changing his name to the Fisherman—this was the man encountered here. Later, he crossed the sea to Qi, where he was called Master Yayi; in Lu, he was known as Master White Jade; in Tao, he became Lord Zhu. Concealing his brilliance and obscuring his traces, he adapted to the times, even sending a letter to Minister Zhong. *Yu* (揄) means to wave; *mei* (袂), the sleeve. *Yuan* (原) refers to high, level ground; *ju* (距), to arrive. Hair and brows white as snow mark the visage of the long-lived; unbound hair and no cap, the bearing of a rustic. From afar, he gazed upon the plain, waving his sleeves as he walked. Reaching the high shore, he moored his boat, propped his chin, and clasped his knees, listening to the zither and song. Then he beckoned to Zilu and Zigong, and both responded.

The stranger pointed at Confucius and asked, “What manner of man is he?”

*Subcommentary:* He inquired as to Confucius’s rank and title.

Zilu replied, “A gentleman of Lu.”

*Subcommentary:* He answered that he was a worthy gentleman of the state of Lu.

The stranger asked of his lineage. Zilu replied, “The lineage of Kong.”

*Subcommentary:* When asked of his clan, he answered that his surname was Kong.

The stranger said, “And what does this Kong practice?”

*Subcommentary:* He further asked by what methods or arts the Kong lineage cultivated itself.

Zilu did not answer, but Zigong replied, “The Kong lineage follows loyalty and trust as its nature, embodies benevolence and righteousness in action, refines ritual and music, selects and orders human relationships. Above, it is loyal to the rulers of the age; below, it transforms the common people. Its aim is to benefit all under heaven—this is what the Kong lineage practices.”

*Subcommentary:* Following its nature with humility and harmony, it treads the path of the sages, refines ritual and music, selects and orders human relationships, serves the ruler with sincerity, and brings transformation to the people. Its intent is to benefit all beings—such is the heart of the Kong lineage.

The stranger asked again, “Is he a lord with lands?”

Zigong said, “No.”

Is he an advisor to kings and lords?

Zigong said, “No.”

*Subcommentary:* Is he a lord enfeoffed with land and rank? Or is he an advisor to kings and lords, a minister or chancellor? To all these, the answer was no. The stranger laughed and turned away, saying as he went, “Benevolent, to be sure—but I fear he will not escape harm to himself. His heart labors and his form toils, endangering his true nature. Alas! How far removed he is from the Dao.”

*Subcommentary:* To labor the heart and toil the form, endangering one’s true nature—such is the path of those who practice partial benevolence. They stray ever farther from the root, becoming ever more distant from the mysterious Dao. Thus he laughed in hesitation, sighing in lament.

Zigong returned and reported this to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and rose, saying, “He must be a sage.” He then went down to seek him. By the marsh’s edge, the stranger was just then using a pole to guide his boat. Turning, he saw Confucius and stood facing him. Confucius retreated, then advanced again, bowing twice.

*Subcommentary:* *Ná* means to guide. Retreating and then advancing again was a gesture of reverence.

The stranger asked, “What do you seek?”

Confucius replied, “A short while ago, sir, you left behind some parting words. I, Qiu, am unworthy and did not grasp their meaning. I have waited humbly in your wake, hoping to hear even the sound of your cough or sigh, that I might receive your instruction to the end and be aided thereby.”

*Subcommentary:* *Nǎng* means “earlier.” *Xùyán* means “remaining discourse.” *Sòng* means “to complete.” *Xiāng* means “to assist.” Earlier, the gentleman left behind some refined discourse. I, Qiu, am dull and did not understand its import. I waited humbly in your wake, hoping to catch even the sound of your voice, that I might receive your words in full and be aided in my inadequacy.

The stranger said, “Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!”

Confucius bowed twice and rose, saying, “From my youth I have cultivated learning, and now, at sixty-nine years of age, I have yet to hear the ultimate teaching. How dare I not remain open in heart?”

*Subcommentary:* *Xī* is an exclamation of laughter. From my youth I have studied benevolence and righteousness, yet even now, in old age, I have not heard the ultimate Dao. Thus I remain reverent, humble, and open in heart.

The stranger said, “Like attracts like, and sound responds to sound—this is the principle of heaven. I shall set forth what I possess and examine what you practice.”

*Subcommentary:* When the tiger roars, the wind stirs; when the dragon rises, clouds gather—this is the natural principle, and so it must be. Thus the Fisherman, a great worthy, and Zhongni, the ultimate sage, were drawn together, like responding to like. Therefore, I shall expound the Dao of the world beyond and examine the affairs you cultivate within the world.

“What you practice concerns human affairs. When the Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, the great officers, and the common people—these four ranks—each maintains its proper place, governance is excellent. But when these four ranks depart from their stations, no disorder is greater. When officials attend to their duties and people concern themselves with their tasks, there is no encroachment.”

*Subcommentary:* *Líng* means “disorder.” Human affairs are manifold, but none are more essential than these four ranks. When each maintains its station, teaching and governance flourish. But when superiors and inferiors overstep, no disorder is greater. Thus, when the hundred officials each fulfill their duties and the common people attend to their work without encroachment, this is the unchanging Dao.

“When fields lie fallow and houses leak, when clothing and food are insufficient, when taxes and levies are unrelenting, when wives and concubines are discordant, when elders and juniors lack order—these are the concerns of the common people.”

*Subcommentary:* When fields lie barren and houses leak, when taxes are incessant and fail to correspond, when wives and concubines lose their proper order and elders and juniors lack sequence—these are the afflictions of the common people.

“Inability to fulfill one’s duties, failure to govern official matters, conduct that is not pure, subordinates who are negligent, failure to achieve merit, inability to maintain rank and emolument—these are the concerns of the great officers.”

*Subcommentary:* Inability to fulfill one’s duties, failure to manage affairs, the people’s neglect, the four occupations’ indolence—these are the concerns of the great officers.

“Lack of loyal ministers in the court, the state’s confusion and disorder, artisans’ lack of skill, tribute that is not fine, falling behind in the spring and autumn audiences, disobedience to the Son of Heaven—these are the concerns of the feudal lords.”

*Subcommentary:* Disloyal ministers, failure to present tribute, falling behind in the spring and autumn assemblies, disobedience to the Son of Heaven—these are the concerns of the five ranks of lords.

“When yin and yang are not in harmony, when cold and heat are untimely, harming the myriad things; when feudal lords are violent and disorderly, seizing and attacking one another, harming the people; when ritual and music lack moderation, resources are exhausted, human relationships are not ordered, and the hundred clans are licentious—these are the concerns of the Son of Heaven’s officials.”

*Subcommentary:* *Rǎng* means “to remove.” When yin and yang are not regulated and the seasons deviate, when weapons and warfare arise repeatedly and the myriad things are cut short, these are the concerns of the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers.

“Now, you possess neither the authority of the Son of Heaven’s officials and feudal lords above, nor the office of a great minister with its duties below. Yet you presume to adorn ritual and music, select and order human relationships, and transform the common people. Is this not excessively meddlesome?”

*Subcommentary:* Lacking the position of the Son of Heaven or feudal lords above, or of ministers and chancellors below, yet presuming to adorn ritual and music, select and order human relationships, and transform the common people—this is the conduct of one who meddles excessively.

“Moreover, people have eight faults, and affairs have four perils—these cannot but be examined. To attend to affairs that are not one’s own is called *zǒng*.”

*Subcommentary:* *Zǒng* means “indiscriminate.” To force knowledge of matters that are not one’s own is called meddling.

“To advance where one is not heeded is called *nìng*.”

*Subcommentary:* To force the offering of loyal words when they are not heeded is called flattery.

“To guide speech by currying favor is called *chǎn*.”

*Subcommentary:* To hope to align with another’s intentions and guide their speech is called sycophancy.

“To speak without distinguishing right from wrong is called *yú*.”

*Subcommentary:* To comply indiscriminately without distinguishing right from wrong is called obsequiousness.

“To delight in speaking of others’ faults is called *chán*.”

“To hear of others’ faults and delight in exposing their failures is called *chán*.”

*Subcommentary:* To hear of others’ faults and take pleasure in broadcasting their failures.

“To sever friendships and estrange kin is called *zéi*.”

*Subcommentary:* When others share bonds of kinship or friendship, to cleave and divide them is called destructive harm.

“To praise falsely and slander others in order to ruin the virtuous is called *tè*.”

*Subcommentary:* Those close to oneself, though wicked, are praised; those distant, though good, are slandered. Through such deceit and malice, delighting in harming others—this is the mark of a treacherous person.

“To make no distinction between good and evil, accommodating both sides with an agreeable countenance, and stealthily advancing one’s own desires is called *xiǎn*.”

*Subcommentary:* *Fǒu* means “evil.” Embracing both good and evil without discrimination, maintaining a pleasant demeanor, and surreptitiously promoting one’s own wishes—following and flattering accordingly—this is the mark of a deceitful and perverse person.

These eight flaws externally confuse others and internally harm oneself. The noble person does not befriend such people, nor does the enlightened ruler employ them.

*Subcommentary:* Externally, they bewilder and mislead the common people; internally, they bring ruin to themselves. Thus, the noble person does not take them as friends, and the enlightened ruler does not make them ministers.

As for the four perils:

“To delight in managing great affairs, altering and disrupting the constant order to seek merit and fame is called *tāo*.”

*Subcommentary:* Watching for moments of danger and stability, scheming over great affairs, seizing opportunities for change to establish merit and fame—this is the mark of an intrusive and reckless person.

“To monopolize knowledge and arrogate authority, encroaching upon others and acting self-righteously is called *greed*.”

*Subcommentary:* To arrogate all matters to oneself and domineer over others is called greed.

“To persist in error without correction, and to grow more obstinate upon hearing admonition is called *hěn*.”

*Subcommentary:* To cling to faults without reform, and to become even more stubborn upon hearing counsel—this is the mark of a cruel and obstinate person.

“To approve only what aligns with oneself, and to reject even the good when it differs from oneself is called *jīn*.”

*Subcommentary:* What aligns with oneself, though evil, is deemed good; what differs, though good, is deemed evil—this is the mark of an arrogant and boastful person.

These are the four perils. Only by eliminating the eight flaws and avoiding the four perils can one begin to be taught.

Confucius sighed deeply, bowed twice, and rose, saying: “I was twice exiled from Lu, had my traces erased in Wei, was forced to fell a tree in Song, and was besieged between Chen and Cai. I do not know what wrong I committed to incur these four slanders—why was this?”

*Subcommentary:* *Qiǎorán* describes a look of shame and trepidation. *Lí* means “to encounter.” Having committed no fault yet suffering these four slanders, he had not yet grasped the earlier teaching, hence this doubt.

The guest’s expression turned somber as he replied: “How deeply you resist understanding! There was a man who feared his shadow and loathed his footprints, and so ran to escape them. The more he lifted his feet, the more footprints he left; the faster he ran, the more his shadow clung to him. Believing himself still too slow, he ran without rest until he collapsed and died. He did not realize that by standing in the shade he could have stilled his shadow, and by remaining still he could have ceased his footprints—how foolish he was!

You scrutinize the space between benevolence and righteousness, examine the boundaries of sameness and difference, observe the changes between movement and stillness, measure the limits of giving and receiving, weigh the inclinations of likes and dislikes, and harmonize the moderation of joy and anger—yet you have nearly failed to escape. To carefully cultivate oneself, guard one’s true nature, and return all things to others is to be free from entanglement.

*Subcommentary:* To linger in the space between benevolence and righteousness to attract disciples, to watch for opportunities in the boundaries of sameness and difference, to observe changes in movement and stillness in hopes of luck, to measure the limits of giving and receiving in pursuit of merit and fame, to cling stubbornly to likes and dislikes, to regulate joy and anger as a means to the Way, to instruct others while priding oneself on one’s nature—this is nearly inescapable.

If you diligently cultivate yourself and cautiously preserve your true nature, returning all things to others, then you will be free from burdens.

*Subcommentary:* To carefully tend to one’s body and preserve one’s true nature, returning all merit and fame to others, is to achieve wholeness in both self and things, hence free from harm.

Now, instead of cultivating yourself, you seek it in others—is this not misplaced?”

*Annotation:* To fail to cultivate oneself and seek it in others—is this not estrangement?

Confucius, again abashed, asked: “May I ask what is meant by *the true*?”

The guest replied: “The true is the utmost of essence and sincerity. Without essence and sincerity, one cannot move others.

*Subcommentary:* The true is not false, essence is not adulterated, sincerity is not feigned. Thus, those who feign emotions and falsify their nature cannot move others.

Therefore, forced weeping, though sorrowful, is not mournful; forced anger, though severe, is not awe-inspiring; forced affection, though smiling, is not harmonious. True sorrow is soundless yet mournful, true anger is unexpressed yet awe-inspiring, true affection is unsmiling yet harmonious. When the true resides within, the spirit moves without—this is why the true is prized.

Applied to human affairs, serving parents yields filial devotion, serving rulers yields loyalty, drinking yields joy, and mourning yields grief.

*Subcommentary:* The Way is present in all things, and all things are pervaded by it. Thus, when applied to human relationships, these four arise. The meanings of these four are elaborated below.

Loyalty takes merit as its essence, drinking takes joy as its essence, mourning takes grief as its essence, and serving parents takes suitability as its essence. The beauty of merit’s completion cannot be confined to a single form.

*Subcommentary:* *Zhēn* is the trunk of affairs. Thus, merit is taken as its essence. Drinking dissolves and uplifts the nature, hence joy is its essence. Since merit lies in its beauty, its manifestations cannot be uniform.

Serving parents takes suitability as its essence, without regard for the means; drinking takes joy as its essence, without selecting the instruments; mourning takes grief as its essence, without concern for ritual.

*Subcommentary:* This reiterates the meanings of the four above.

Ritual is what the worldly create; the true is what one receives from Heaven, naturally and unalterably.

*Subcommentary:* Ritual’s refinements are created by the worldly; true nature is bestowed by the great simplicity, naturally and unchangeably so.”

Thus the sage models himself on Heaven and values the true, unbound by worldly conventions.

*Subcommentary:* He emulates the natural and treasures the true Dao, hence he is not constrained by vulgar rituals.

The foolish do the opposite. Unable to model themselves on Heaven, they fret over human affairs; ignorant of the value of the true, they mindlessly conform to worldly changes—thus they are never content.

*Subcommentary:* *Fret* means to worry. *Mindlessly* describes a slavish demeanor. Deluded fools, contrary to the sage’s path, cannot emulate the natural to attain harmony, nor value virtue and power to roam freely. Instead, they drown in worldly affairs, vexed by cares, mired in the dust of clamor, and insatiably chasing things—hence their hearts are ever unsatisfied. Alas! That you were so early steeped in human artifice and so late to hear of the great Dao.

Confucius bowed twice and rose, saying: “Today I have been so fortunate as to meet you—like a blessing from Heaven. You do not disdain to treat me as a servant and instruct me in person. May I ask where you dwell? I would follow you to receive your teaching and complete my study of the great Dao.”

*Subcommentary:* Overjoyed, Confucius sighed in gratitude, as if ascending to Heaven upon meeting the fisherman. He was certain that the man would not scorn to instruct him, and resolved to serve him as a disciple, receiving his personal guidance. He asked where he lived, intending to study the great Dao to its end.

The stranger said: “I have heard that those who can journey with you, take them to the subtle Dao; those who cannot, do not know the Dao—beware of taking them, lest you bring harm upon yourself.”

*Subcommentary:* *Journey* means to progress from delusion to enlightenment. The *subtle Dao* is the true root. *Know* means to discern. If you meet a person of superior wisdom, you may speak to them of the subtle root; if you encounter one of lesser capacity, do not speak to them of the profound ultimate. Observe their capacity and adapt your teaching—only then will you avoid fault.

“Strive on! I leave you now, I leave you now.” With that, he poled his boat away, gliding among the green reeds.

*Subcommentary:* He exhorted Confucius to exert himself. The boat threaded through the upper reaches of the reeds. The repeated “I leave you” was an earnest admonition.

Yan Yuan turned the carriage, and Zilu handed him the reins, but Confucius did not look back. He waited until the water’s ripples stilled and the sound of the oars faded before daring to board.

*Subcommentary:* Having met an extraordinary man who revealed the ultimate Dao to him, Confucius gazed after him with ever-deepening reverence, his heart filled with both joy and awe. Though his disciples offered the reins, he did not glance at them. Only when the boat was far off, the waves calmed, and the sound of the oars vanished did he dare to mount the carriage.

Zilu stepped beside the carriage and asked: “I have long served you, yet never have I seen you meet another with such deference. Kings of ten thousand chariots and lords of a thousand chariots, when they meet you, do not fail to observe proper courtly etiquette—yet you still bear yourself with a certain haughtiness. Now this fisherman stands before you with his oar, and you bow like a chime-stone, answering his words with repeated bows. Is this not excessive? We disciples all find it strange—how has this fisherman earned such treatment?”

*Subcommentary:* The Son of Heaven commands ten thousand chariots; the feudal lords, a thousand. *Courtly etiquette* means to stand opposite. They stand in the courtyard, facing each other with equal rites, their ranks and dignity matched, without any lowering of status. When Confucius met the Son of Heaven or feudal lords, he still maintained a certain haughtiness; yet upon meeting this fisherman, he bowed deeply, humbling himself, and responded to his words with repeated bows. The fisherman’s majesty was such that it elicited this response. Confucius revered the Dao beyond the world, while Zilu was a man of the world—hence his astonishment and his question from beside the carriage.

Confucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed: “You are truly hard to transform, You! You have been steeped in ritual and propriety for so long, yet your crude and vulgar heart has not yet left you.

*Subcommentary:* He had long been immersed in ritual and propriety—hence Confucius sighed, leaning on the crossbar, lamenting his stubbornness.

Come, let me tell you. To meet an elder without respect is to lack ritual; to meet a worthy without reverence is to lack benevolence. If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself before others. If one does not humble oneself with utmost sincerity, one cannot attain the true—thus one harms oneself. Alas! There is no greater calamity for a person than to lack benevolence—and you alone possess it to the full.

*Subcommentary:* He summoned Zilu to come forward and approach. To meet an elder without respect is to fail in ritual propriety; to meet one who is noble without reverence is to lack a benevolent heart. If one is not a person of utmost virtue, one cannot make others feel at ease in one’s humility. If one’s humility is not perfectly sincere, one cannot reach the profound ultimate. To be untransformed and unloving is to lay the foundation for disaster. Alas for Zilu—he alone embodies this failing to the fullest.

Moreover, the Dao is that by which the myriad things proceed. All things that lose it die; those that attain it live. In affairs, to go against it is to fail; to follow it is to succeed. Thus, wherever the Dao resides, the sage reveres it. Now, as for this fisherman and the Dao—he may be said to possess it. How could I dare not revere him?”

*Commentary:* This chapter speaks of one who, though not of the rivers and seas, can humble himself before those of the rivers and seas. Was Confucius’ openness to instruction limited to this fisherman alone? He would roam the six directions, penetrating all without exception. Even the crawling creatures could fully express their hearts to him, and he would exhaust principle and convey destiny—this is indeed the way of the perfected person.

*Subcommentary:* *Proceed* means to follow. *All things* means the multitude. The Dao gives birth to the myriad things—hence it is called the Dao. Thus we know that all things follow the Dao to live. Those who follow it live and succeed; those who go against it die and fail. Regardless of a thing’s worth, where the Dao resides, it is revered. Since this fisherman embodied the Dao, how could Confucius not revere him?

Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan.

Tang dynasty Master of Western Florescence, Cheng Xuanying’s *Subcommentary*
*Miscellaneous Chapters: Lie Yukou*, Chapter Thirty-Two

When Lie Yukou journeyed to Qi, he turned back midway and encountered Bohun Maoren.

**Subcommentary:** Bohun was a worthy gentleman of Chu, known as Bohun Maoren, a recluse. Having studied under Master Huanzi, Yukou also served Bohun. As he set out for Qi, traveling the Way of transformation, he startled himself with the shallowness of his progress and returned mid-journey. There he chanced upon Maoren, who asked him the reason.

Bohun Maoren said: By what Way have you turned back?

**Subcommentary:** *Fang* means "Way." *Xi* means "what." By what Way did you travel? To what destination did you go? He inquired into the cause of his turning back midway.

Yukou said: I was startled.

**Subcommentary:** Recognizing his own inadequacy, he turned back in alarm. This briefly answers the preceding question.

Maoren said: Why were you startled?

**Subcommentary:** He again asked Yukou what matter had provoked his alarm.

Yukou said: I once sought food among ten broth-sellers,

**Annotation:** Households that sold broth.

and five of them served me first.

**Annotation:** This showed their respect for him.

**Subcommentary:** *Kui* means "to offer." *Ten broth-sellers* refers to ten households selling broth. As Liezi traveled thirsty, he sought drink among ten inns selling beverages, and five of them offered him refreshment first. Observing their deference, he was seized by alarm, for he had not yet attained effortless oneness. Thus he turned back in fear.

Bohun Maoren said: If this is so, then why did you startle yourself?

**Subcommentary:** He pressed further to uncover the cause of his alarm, hoping he would confess his error.

Yukou said: My inner sincerity was not yet dissolved,

**Annotation:** He outwardly adorned himself with self-importance.

**Subcommentary:** He realized that his inner wisdom had not yet attained effortless clarity. Being revered by others, he was startled into returning.

My demeanor schemed to shine,

**Annotation:** His conduct was obsequious and ostentatious.

and with outward appearances I overawed others’ hearts.

**Annotation:** His inner substance was insufficient to command respect.

**Subcommentary:** *Mou* describes obsequiousness. *Zhen* means "to subdue." His manner was fawning, his movements radiant. Using such outward appearances, he overawed others.

This caused people to slight the venerable and esteemed,

**Annotation:** Had his authority arisen from inner power, it would have deepened others’ reverence for the aged.

and to court the very source of their troubles.

**Annotation:** When one moves others with outward beauty, disorder arises.

**Subcommentary:** *Zheng* means "disorder." Failing to merge with the world and equalize with dust, he became a standard for others. This led them to revere him while slighting elders, and he feared that calamity and disorder would soon arise. The broth-sellers dealt only in goods for sustenance, with no great profit. Their gains were meager, their influence slight, and yet they acted thus.

**Annotation:** With little influence and scant profit, they had no need to seek favor from others.

How much more so for a lord of ten thousand chariots?

**Subcommentary:** *Te* means "only." *Ying* means "profit." The broth-sellers dealt only in food and drink, with modest earnings. Their profit was meager, their influence light, yet they still revered him and hastened to offer him broth. How much more so for a ruler, whose power is vast and profit abundant—should not people hasten to honor him?

I exhaust myself for the state and expend my knowledge in affairs. He would entrust me with tasks and measure me by my achievements. This is why I was startled.

**Subcommentary:** A ruler of men oversees all matters of state and commands authority across the four seas. Thus he wearies himself for the realm and exhausts his mind in worldly affairs, thirsting for worthy men to relieve his burdens. He would surely entrust me with duties and test me by my accomplishments, leading me to lose my inner truth in pursuit of the external and forget authenticity in favor of pretense. The cause of my alarm is fully set forth here.

Bohun Maoren said: Excellent is your observation!

**Subcommentary:** You have examined yourself and discerned gain and loss. I commend your self-awareness, hence I say "excellent."

If you abide in yourself, others will safeguard you.

**Annotation:** If one does not abandon form, one will naturally be safeguarded wherever one is. *Safeguard* means to gather and protect.

**Subcommentary:** *Bao* means "to guard." If you settle into yourself without forgetting your person, yet still display your form and power, others will be drawn to you. Disciples will seek instruction, gathering to protect you.

Before long, he went to Yukou’s dwelling, and the sandals outside the door were piled high.

**Subcommentary:** *Before long* means "after little time." In a brief moment, Bohun visited Yukou’s abode and saw sandals discarded outside the door. Barefoot, Yukou had ascended the hall, and many had come to seek instruction.

Bohun Maoren stood facing north, leaning firmly on his staff and propping his chin upon it. He stood among them for a time, then departed without speaking.

**Subcommentary:** *Dun* means "firm." Leaning on his staff and resting his chin upon it, he listened to their discourse. He stood among them for a long while, then departed in wordless silence.

The attendant informed Liezi, who grasped his sandals and ran barefoot. Reaching the gate, he said: Since you have come, Master, have you no medicine to dispense?

**Subcommentary:** The *attendant* refers to the one who received guests. Hearing that his teacher and friend had stood among them without speaking before departing, Yukou was filled with awe and shame. Without pausing to don his sandals, he ran barefoot to the gate and turned back, saying: Since you have come, noble one, I hoped you might apply the needle and moxa, yet you have not once opened your medicine case before leaving. His sincere thirst for instruction prompted this earnest plea.

Maoren said: It is done. I had already told you that others would safeguard you, and indeed they have safeguarded you.

**Subcommentary:** "Done" means "stop." I had already told you before that others would safeguard you, yet you could not conceal your light and hide your traces, so you were inevitably sought out by others. Now I see your disciples filling the room—my earlier words to you were surely not empty. Cease your entreaties; spare yourself the trouble of further speech. It is not that you can make others safeguard you, but that you cannot prevent others from safeguarding you.

**Commentary:** When one acts with equanimity and transforms, there is no stirring, no seeking. Without stirring or seeking, there is no mutual safeguarding.

**Subcommentary:** When one displays traces outwardly, others will safeguard them. Yet if one has not forgotten virtue, one cannot be without self-preservation. Why then provoke or preemptively display distinction?

**Commentary:** To bestow favors before others act is to bestow without cause; preemption is distinction.

**Subcommentary:** "You" refers to Yukou. Why must self and others be forgotten before there is no need for others to stir one? If there must be a stimulus to provoke response, there is no need to preemptively display distinction or bestow favors before others act. If there must be a stimulus, one’s fundamental nature is shaken—this is meaningless.

**Commentary:** If there must be a stimulus, then one moves with fundamental nature.

**Subcommentary:** "Shaken" means "moved." If there must be compulsion before rising, one follows fundamental nature, responding while erasing traces and concealing beginnings—what is there to praise? Those who wander with you offer no true counsel; their petty words are all poison to others.

**Commentary:** Petty and clever words that deceive others are called "petty words."

**Subcommentary:** Those who share your path and understanding indulge only in frivolous, clever speech, flattering others—all of it like turtledove’s poison. How could they use the Way to instruct you? None awaken, none comprehend—how could any discern and inform another?

The cunning labor, the wise fret; the incapable seek nothing. Sated, they roam, drifting like an untethered boat—empty, they wander.

**Commentary:** Only the sage is truly incapable. From those below to the crawling insects, none forget their abilities to rely on the multitude.

**Subcommentary:** Things do nothing, yet one wearies oneself with cleverness and knowledge. Only the sage drifts without attachment, the mind forgotten, like an empty boat, following fate in carefree ease.

A man of Zheng named Huan chanted and studied in the land of Qiu. After three years, Huan became a Confucian.

**Commentary:** "Chanted" means recitation. "Qiu" is a place name. "Zhi" means "just."

**Subcommentary:** "Chanted" means reciting and reading. Qiu is a place name. "Zhi" means "just." A man of Zheng named Huan studied in the land of Qiu; after three years, he mastered the Confucian Way. His influence moistened nine li, his virtue extended to three clans, and he made his younger brother a Mohist.

**Commentary:** The three clans are father’s, mother’s, and wife’s. He enabled his brother to succeed in Mohist teachings.

Confucians and Mohists debated, and their father sided with Di.

**Commentary:** Di was Huan’s younger brother.

**Subcommentary:** Di was Huan’s younger brother. Confucians follow the statutes of Wen and Wu, tracing their lineage to Yao and Shun, yet they are stubborn and loquacious. Mohists emulate the Way of Yu, valuing frugality and generosity. Confucians and Mohists diverge in path and aspiration, each clinging to right and wrong, debating fiercely. The father, siding with the younger son, aided Di.

After ten years, Huan took his own life. His father dreamed of him, saying: "The one who made your son a Mohist was your son. Why did you not once look upon his virtue? He has already become the fruit of the autumn cypress."

**Commentary:** Huan resented his father for aiding his brother, so in grief and indignation, he took his own life. In death, he appeared in a dream, saying: "I transformed myself into a Confucian and transformed my brother into a Mohist. My brother, transformed by me, could not follow me. I, a virtuous teacher, resented this to the point of death—my sincerity was such that I became the fruit of the autumn cypress."

**Subcommentary:** "He" means "why not." The autumn cypress is a sturdy tree. The father aided Di, and Huan resented him. After ten years, in grief and indignation, he took his own life, appearing in a dream to reproach his father: "The one who made your son a Mohist was my doing. Why did you not recognize me as a virtuous teacher and instead ally with my brother? My resentment was so great that I transformed into the fruit of the autumn cypress, growing on my grave." Some texts use "垠" (grave), saying: "Why did you not look upon my grave, where I have transformed into an autumn cypress bearing fruit?"

The Creator’s recompense to man does not repay the man but repays the man’s Heaven.

**Commentary:** From here onward are Zhuangzi’s words. The recompense lies in the accumulation of practice, repaying one’s nature, not one’s actions. Thus, the effort of study and practice perfects one’s nature—how could it be for the sake of action?

**Subcommentary:** The Creator is the great furnace of nature, yet the Creator is no-thing, able to transform all things—hence the name "Creator." The wisdom and ability of things are endowed by transformation, not acquired through study. Thus, study and practice assist the natural Way, repaying one’s Heavenly nature, not human effort. We know that Di had a Mohist nature, not acquired from Huan. Huan’s claim to have taught him was mistaken.

It was his nature that enabled him.

**Commentary:** He had that nature, so he was made to practice it.

**Subcommentary:** Di originally possessed a Mohist nature, so he became a Mohist. If one’s nature lacked it from the start, study would never succeed. This is not only true of Mo Di—all things are thus.

People consider themselves distinct from others and despise their kin.

Those who take credit to belittle others do not spare even their kin, while those who forget themselves to follow their inherent nature maintain proper order between noble and base.

**Subcommentary:** Huan, relying on his own accumulated learning, considered himself distinct from ordinary people, thus despising his kin and scorning his father. How deeply deluded people become to reach such a state! The well-drawers of Qi fought one another over water. Hence it is said: the world today is full of Huans.

**Commentary:** Digging wells serves to channel springs; chanting serves to channel nature. Without springs, there would be nothing to dig; without nature, nothing to chant. Yet the world forgets the naturalness of springs and nature, recognizing only the superficial work of digging and chanting. They then claim possession with pride—is this not delusion?

**Subcommentary:** The earth holds springs, and each person has their nature—this is Heaven. Digging to form wells and studying to master arts—this is human effort. Alas, how profoundly the world is deluded! They know only the superficial tasks of digging and learning, failing to awaken to the naturalness of springs and nature, yet boasting of these as their own achievements. Thus, the world is filled with followers of Huan. When the people of Qi dug a well and travelers came to draw water, the well’s owner seized them by the hair to stop them. Zhuangzi heard of this and used it as an analogy.

From this, those of virtue come to know ignorance, while those who embody the Dao remain untouched.

**Commentary:** Observing Huan’s errors in learning, the father simply let things be as they were, knowing without interference.

**Subcommentary:** Seeing Huan’s delusion, believing himself truly virtuous, from then on he forgot knowledge and let things take their course, no longer boasting of himself. How much more so for one who embodies the Dao—would they regard such efforts as their own?

In ancient times, this was called "the punishment of fleeing from Heaven."

**Commentary:** Those who claim Heaven’s natural abilities as their own achievements flee from Heaven, and thus punishment befalls them.

**Subcommentary:** Not recognizing that things are naturally as they are, and boasting of them as personal achievements, is to flee from Heaven’s principle. Having violated the workings of creation, punishment inevitably follows.

The sage finds peace in what is naturally peaceful and does not impose peace where it is not;

**Commentary:** The sage is neither at peace nor not at peace, but follows the hearts of the people.

**Subcommentary:** To find peace is to follow. Following the nature of all beings, not forcing things to conform to oneself, and not imposing what is absent in their nature—this is what makes one a sage.

The multitude finds peace in what is not naturally peaceful and does not find peace in what is.

**Commentary:** Their sense of peace differs from others, which is why they are the multitude.

**Subcommentary:** They learn what they cannot, finding peace in what is not naturally peaceful; they do not find peace in their inherent nature, failing to rest in what is naturally peaceful.

Zhuangzi said: "Knowing the Dao is easy; refraining from speech is difficult."

**Subcommentary:** The profound Dao is obscure and formless, beyond words and images. To comprehend it is easy, but to forget speech is truly hard.

To know and not speak is to reach Heaven; to know and speak is to remain among men.

**Subcommentary:** Profoundly awakening to the mysterious Dao, with no method to express it, one attains the realm of nature. Though one may know the ultimate, as long as words and distinctions remain, one has not departed from the human realm.

The people of old were Heavenly and not human.

**Commentary:** Knowing yet aligning with Heaven and Earth, they never spoke to lead others, responding only to their inherent limits.

**Subcommentary:** The true persons of antiquity, those who knew the Dao, were naturally pure and free from human emotions.

Zhu Hanman studied dragon-slaying under Zhi Liyi, exhausting a thousand gold fortune. After three years, his skill was perfected, yet he had no use for his craft.

**Commentary:** What matters is suitability; there is no value in distant or impractical efforts.

**Subcommentary:** His surname was Zhu, given name Hanman. His teacher’s surname was Zhi, given name Liyi. He spent his entire fortune learning the art of slaying dragons. After three years of devoted study, his technique was mastered, yet his skill was ultimately useless. Dragon-slaying is a rare pursuit in the world. This illustrates that in navigating human affairs, what matters is appropriateness. If one’s actions do not align with the moment, even great efforts are of no benefit.

The sage takes what must not be as not necessary, thus having no conflict;

**Commentary:** Though a principle may be inevitable, to treat it as not necessary is the height of harmony. How could conflict arise?

**Subcommentary:** One who has attained the Dao follows the inclinations of things. Though a principle may be inevitable, they do not cling to it, and thus avoid contention.

The multitude takes what is not necessary as necessary, thus creating much conflict;

**Commentary:** Though a principle may not be inevitable, to insist on it as necessary leads each to cling to their own views, breeding discord.

**Subcommentary:** The common people stubbornly hold to their delusions. Though a principle may not be inevitable, they insist on it as such, clashing with the nature of things and creating much discord.

Following conflict, they act with demands.

**Commentary:** When each follows their nature, they are sufficient, and sufficiency leaves no room for demands.

**Subcommentary:** With hearts full of greed and desire, they indulge in rigid attachments.

Conflict, when relied upon, leads to ruin.

**Commentary:** When used out of necessity, with tranquility as the highest aim, it does not lead to ruin.

**Subcommentary:** Failing to follow the great harmony of destiny and instead delighting in discord with the nature of things brings one close to losing what is truly precious.

The knowledge of petty men does not extend beyond gift-bearing and letter-writing.

**Commentary:** Gift-bearing to bestow, letter-writing to inquire—these are the pursuits of small minds.

**Subcommentary:** Petty men are like commoners. *Baoju* refers to fragrant herbs; *gandu* refers to bamboo slips. Plucking fragrant herbs to give as gifts or breaking bamboo slips to send letters—these are trivial matters of the world, not what a true person should deign to do.

They waste their spirit on the shallow and narrow.

**Commentary:** Obsessed with trivial matters, their gains are meager.

**Subcommentary:** Indulging in gift-giving and inquiries, they exhaust their spirit on lame and shallow pursuits, unable to roam the vast and distant.

Those who seek to universally aid and guide all things yet leave their forms hollow and empty—such people are lost amid the cosmos, their bodies burdened, unaware of the Great Beginning.

**Commentary:** The knowledge of petty men, though they aspire to universally aid and guide all things, traverses emptiness and roams afar. Their ambitions are vast, but their spirits are exhausted, their forms encumbered—thus they become bewildered and lose the proper attainment.

**Subcommentary:** With shallow understanding, they yet desire to universally aid all beings and guide all lives, hoping to empty their forms and merge with the mysterious Dao of the Great Unity—this is ultimately impossible. Such people are deluded by past and present, their bodies burdened by the six directions; how can they illuminate and comprehend the wondrous principle of the Great Beginning?

The perfected person, however, returns their spirit to the Beginningless and finds contentment in slumber within the land of Nothing-Whatsoever.

**Subcommentary:** The Beginningless is the wondrous root; the land of Nothing-Whatsoever is the realm of the Dao. The person of utmost virtue, though ever in motion, remains perpetually still. Even while universally aiding and guiding all things, their spirit congeals in the Beginningless—thus they harmonize their light with the world and constantly repose in the homeland of the Dao.

Water flows without form, issuing forth into the Great Purity.

**Commentary:** Placidly non-active, it follows the natural course.

**Subcommentary:** Without obstruction, it accords with things like flowing water, adapting to change with the times, not clinging to form or trace. Traces do not depart from the root, so though responsive to movement, it constantly issues forth into the utmost of the Great Purity.

Alas! Your knowledge resides in the tip of a hair,

**Commentary:** What their knowledge attains is minute.

Yet you know not the Great Tranquility.

**Commentary:** They attain the Great Tranquility by following their nature.

**Subcommentary:** Gift-bearing and letter-writing—how do these differ from the tip of a hair? To wield wisdom in such a way is deeply lamentable. With shallow and meager spirit, how could they know the Dao of utmost stillness?

A man of Song named Cao Shang was sent by the King of Song as an envoy to Qin. When he first went, he received several chariots; the King of Qin was pleased with him and added a hundred more chariots. **Subcommentary:** His surname was Cao, given name Shang, a man of Song. Sent by King Yan of Song as envoy to Qin, he responded aptly, and the King of Qin favored him, bestowing upon him a hundred chariots. A *cheng* refers to a team of four horses.

Returning to Song, he saw Zhuangzi and said: "To dwell in a wretched alley, hard-pressed and weaving sandals, with a withered neck and sallow face—this is what I am poor at. But to awaken a ruler of ten thousand chariots and follow in a train of a hundred chariots—this is what I excel at." **Subcommentary:** *Jiong* means distress. To speak of poverty and hardship, weaving sandals to sustain oneself, with a gaunt neck and emaciated face—at such a time, this is what I am poor at. Yet with a single mission to mighty Qin, I so startled the King of Qin that he bestowed a hundred chariots—this is the strength of my cunning. Thus he boasted to Zhuangzi.

Zhuangzi said: "The King of Qin, when ill, summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils and drained abscesses received one chariot; those who licked his hemorrhoids received five chariots. The baser the treatment, the more chariots they received. Did you, perchance, treat his hemorrhoids? How else could you have received so many chariots? Begone!"

**Commentary:** Only by serving the lowly can one’s merits become great; only with great merits can one’s emoluments become weighty. Thus those who are lofty, distant, and serene in their indifference abandon worldly honors.

**Subcommentary:** *Yong* refers to an itching, inflamed, and poisonous swelling. *Zhi* refers to the disease of anal fistula. Master Zhuang, with his transcendent spirit and keen insight, aspired to purity and loftiness. Here, he unleashed his extraordinary eloquence to rebuke Cao Shang. As Guo’s annotation states: *Only by serving the lowly can one’s merits become great; only with great merits can one’s emoluments become weighty. Those who are lofty, distant, and serene in their indifference abandon worldly honors.*

Duke Ai of Lu asked Yan He: “I regard Confucius as the pillar of integrity—will the state then be free of disorder?”
**Subcommentary:** Confucius possessed the virtue of loyal integrity and the power to govern. If appointed as chief minister, the afflictions of the state of Lu would surely be cured.

Yan He replied: “Confucius is perilously close to ruin.”
**Commentary:** *Ji* means peril. The perfected person finds peace in the stillness of the people. But if one becomes a pillar of integrity, one leaves behind a lofty legacy for ten thousand generations, inciting competition over the Seven Teachings and embellishing superficial adornments. The people will then be imperiled, and the perfected person will have no means of finding peace.
**Subcommentary:** *Dai* means near. *Ji* means peril. To lead the people by the example of integrity is to cause them to lose their nature—how then could Confucius find peace? Soon they will be adorning feathers and painting patterns,
**Commentary:** Whenever the phrase *fang qie* (“soon they will”) appears, it refers to later generations. Those who engage in such adornment and painting are not true to their nature.
**Subcommentary:** If Confucius were to serve as chief minister in the court of Lu, future generations would chase after his example, embellishing their conduct and losing their true nature.

They would engage in florid rhetoric, taking fragmentation as their guiding principle,
**Commentary:** This would cause later generations, in their pursuit of governance, to lack substance while their intentions and inclinations proliferate wildly.
**Subcommentary:** Once the sage’s traces are manifest, those who follow in governance and service will employ artifice and florid words, splitting streams and dividing currents as their guiding principle.

They would suppress their nature to observe the people, yet remain unaware of their own lack of sincerity,
**Commentary:** Later rulers, admiring Confucius’ distant path, would forcibly suppress their nature and act with hypocrisy in governing the people. As superiors and subordinates imitate one another, they would no longer recognize their own falsity.
**Subcommentary:** Later rulers, admiring Confucius’ distant path, would forcibly restrain their nature to govern the people. As superiors and subordinates imitate one another, they would deceive the common folk, unaware of their own lack of sincerity.

Using these embellished and false traces to instruct the black-haired masses, they would receive them in their hearts and wield them with their spirits, severing their true nature. How could one who governs the people in this way be worthy of praise? What suffices to govern the people is to receive it in the heart and wield it with the spirit.
**Commentary:** If one governs the people in this way, later generations would not merely follow outwardly but would receive and employ it with their hearts and spirits, unable to return to the self-possession of their inherent nature.
**Subcommentary:** Those later generations would not merely follow outwardly but would receive and employ it with their hearts and spirits, unable to recover their true nature. How could one who governs the people in this way find peace?

Are they suitable for you?
**Commentary:** *Bi* refers to the people; *ru* refers to Duke Ai. The people and you each have what is suitable for yourselves. To imitate one another is to lose the true. This is the very evidence we see today.
**Subcommentary:** *Bi* refers to the people; *ru* refers to Duke Ai. The people and you each have what is suitable for yourselves. What is suitable for you cannot be given to the people.

Should I provide nourishment for them?
**Commentary:** Imitating them is not the way to nurture oneself.
**Subcommentary:** *Yu* means “I”; *yi* means “nourishment.” The nourishment of the people and myself differ—like fish and birds, their rising and sinking are not the same. If you were to apply your own nourishment to others, both would be lost.

To err in this way would be acceptable.

To follow the traces of steadfast integrity in error is fundamentally unacceptable. Now, if we cause the people to abandon their true nature and study falsity, this is no way to guide them. Considering the generations to come, it would be better to cease such efforts.

**Commentary:** The question does not refer to the present time.

**Subcommentary:** To forsake one’s true nature and study false methods cannot serve to instruct the common folk. Fearing disorder in later ages, it is better to desist.

It is difficult to govern.

**Commentary:** To govern is to foster falsity, so the sage does not govern.

**Subcommentary:** To abandon oneself and imitate others—this the sage does not do.

To bestow upon others yet not forget is not the spontaneous distribution of Heaven.

**Commentary:** To distribute while keeping account is not the way of the straw dogs of the ten thousand things.

**Subcommentary:** The Two Modes spontaneously generate the ten thousand things—how could they value favor?

Merchants are held in contempt,

**Commentary:** How much more so scholars and gentlemen?

**Subcommentary:** Those who bestow seeking repayment are even despised by merchants—how much more so gentlemen and scholars?

Even if, for the sake of affairs, they are accorded rank, the spirit disregards them.

**Commentary:** Though one must acknowledge their acts of kindness in worldly matters, their failure to forget renders them insignificant in the eyes of the spirit.

This is the great disposition of the common people.

**Subcommentary:** To bestow yet not forget does not accord with the Way of Heaven. Though one must acknowledge their acts of kindness in worldly affairs, their demand for repayment causes the spirit to dismiss them lightly—such is the nature of the common people.

What governs these affairs is human nature and emotion. External punishments are metal and wood;

**Commentary:** Metal refers to blades, saws, axes, and halberds; wood refers to rods, cudgels, stocks, and fetters.

Internal punishments are movement and transgression.

**Commentary:** When one is still and appropriate, there are no punishments, internal or external.

When petty men incur external punishments, metal and wood interrogate them;

**Subcommentary:** *Xiao* means the dark of night. *Li* means to entangle. *Xun* means to question. Those benighted and deluded, ensnared in the net of law, suffer the punishments of cangues, fetters, axes, and halberds.

When they incur internal punishments, yin and yang consume them.

**Commentary:** To move beyond one’s proper measure is to injure the inner nature and qi, just as metal and wood interrogate externally.

**Subcommentary:** If one does not cease transgressing, then internally, cold and heat congeal, and yin and yang erode them.

Only the true person can escape both internal and external punishments.

**Commentary:** Unless one is a true person, none can halt at their proper measure. Thus, all inevitably suffer internal or external punishments—only the degree varies.

**Subcommentary:** With a heart like dead ashes, the inner spirit is not disturbed; with a form like withered wood, the outer self is not bound by fetters. Only the true person achieves this.

Confucius said: The human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to know than Heaven. Heaven at least has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer—and its fixed times of dawn and dusk. But humans possess thick appearances and deep emotions.

**Subcommentary:** The human heart is harder to know than mountains and rivers, more inscrutable than the azure sky. The depth of its deceptions is set forth below.

Thus, some appear sincere yet are insincere; some seem timid yet are unworthy;

**Subcommentary:** *Yuan* means genuine. *Bu xiao* means unseemly. Some have the appearance of sincerity yet harbor frivolous hearts; others possess true worth yet seem unworthy.

Some appear compliant yet are distant;

**Subcommentary:** *Huai* means urgency. Some appear compliant and hasty yet their hearts grasp principle.

Some seem steadfast yet are lax; some seem relaxed yet are sharp.

**Commentary:** Human emotions and appearances often reverse in this way.

**Subcommentary:** *Man* means lax. *Han* means urgent. Some appear steadfast yet are truly scattered; others seem relaxed yet are inwardly sharp.

Thus, those who approach righteousness as if parched may flee it as if scorched.

**Commentary:** It is not that there are no traces—only that they are hard to discern.

**Subcommentary:** Some pursue righteousness as if thirsting for water, yet abandon it as if fleeing fire. Though difficult to discern, their traces are not entirely absent. Proof is provided below.

Therefore, the gentleman sends them far to observe their loyalty, brings them near to observe their reverence,

**Subcommentary:** Sending them far reveals loyalty or treachery; a single step shows respect or disdain.

Assigns them complex tasks to observe their ability,

**Subcommentary:** Overwhelming them with duties tests their competence.

Suddenly questions them to observe their knowledge,

**Subcommentary:** Abrupt questions and immediate responses reveal their sincerity and wisdom.

Sets urgent deadlines to observe their trustworthiness,

**Subcommentary:** Sudden appointments test their reliability.

Entrusts them with wealth to observe their benevolence,

**Subcommentary:** The benevolent are not greedy.

Warns them of danger to observe their integrity,

**Subcommentary:** Warning of peril reveals their steadfastness.

Intoxicates them with wine to observe their propriety, mingles them with others to observe their demeanor.

**Subcommentary:** The perfected cannot be confused by wine; their principles remain unshaken. Even when men and women dwell together, their chastity does not waver.

When all nine tests are complete, the unworthy are exposed.

**Subcommentary:** The gentleman is easy to discern; the unworthy are hard to fathom. Yet by examining their conduct, observing their paths, and scrutinizing their contentment, even through indirect means, one may come to know them.

Zheng Kaofu, upon his first appointment, bent low; upon his second, stooped; upon his third, bowed deeply. He walked along the wall, and who would dare act improperly toward him?

**Commentary:** No one would dare insult him with unruly conduct.

**Subcommentary:** *Kao* means accomplished; *fu* means great. One of accomplished virtue who walks the upright path is called Zheng Kaofu—Confucius’ ancestor, a grandee of Song. A scholar receives one appointment, a grandee two, and a minister three. Bent, stooped, and bowing deeply, his reverence was extreme. So humble and retiring, who would dare insult him with unruly conduct?

But there are those who, upon their first appointment, strut like Lü Ju; upon their second, dance atop their carriage; upon their third, call others "uncle." Who would align with such as Tang Xu?

**Commentary:** *Erfu* refers to the common man. *Tang* refers to Yao; *Xu* refers to Xu You. It speaks of how the common man compares to Kaofu—who could align with the deeds of Tang and Xu?

**Subcommentary:** *Erfu* is the vulgar man. *Zhufu* means uncles. The common man, eager for rank and eminence, upon his first appointment flaunts like Lü Ju; upon his second, seizes the carriage strap and dances; upon his third, proudly names his uncles. Yet Kaofu’s humility and the common man’s arrogance differ so greatly—how could their measure and worth be compared? Who could match the effortless virtue of Yao and Xu You, who yielded the throne in non-action?

No thief is greater than virtue with intent.
**Commentary:** Virtue pursued with intent is not true virtue. True virtue arises spontaneously, unknowing of its own power.

**Subcommentary:** To scheme and strain the mind in pursuit of virtue is the gravest harm. Yet the mind has its lashes—
**Commentary:** To follow the mind in virtue may yet be tolerable; but to bind the mind to the space between the brows is already excessive pretense. And if it has eyes yet turns inward, turning inward leads to ruin.
**Commentary:** To probe and pry into the obscure, making depth one’s aim, is to ruin both mind and endeavor.

**Subcommentary:** To enslave the mind, exhausting spirit in the space between the eyes and lashes, chasing thoughts without cease—this is the path to grave peril.

Five baleful virtues exist, and the central virtue is chief among them.
**Subcommentary:** These are the heart, ears, eyes, tongue, and nose—the five roots. Disaster arises from these virtues, hence they are called baleful. Of the five roots, the chief disaster lies in the central virtue, the heart without emptiness. What is the central virtue? The central virtue is to cherish one’s own preferences and revile what one does not do.
**Commentary:** To condemn. To esteem oneself and reject others invites many attacks, making it the chief of baleful traits. If the center harbors no self-cherishing, then it freely affirms what all things affirm. Each affirmation remains untainted, and the world will eagerly submit to it.

**Subcommentary:** To condemn. To take what the heart cherishes as right and revile what differs from oneself—this is to regard the heart’s self-affirmation as virtue, hence called the central virtue.

There are eight extremes of ruin, three certainties of success, and six bodily palaces.
**Subcommentary:** The eight extremes and three certainties pertain to ruin and success, just as the body has six palaces—detailed below.

Handsome beard, great stature, robust build, radiant beauty, courage, and daring—eight traits that surpass others, yet through them one meets ruin.
**Commentary:** Ruin in servitude. Yet the world is never ruined by its shortcomings, but ever by its strengths.

**Subcommentary:** *Mei* means flattering charm; *ran*, the whiskers and sideburns; *chang*, height; *da*, girth; *zhuang*, strength; *li*, splendor; *yong*, ferocity; *gan*, bold decisiveness.

Possessing these eight traits, surpassing ordinary people, one is burdened with many servile tasks and thus falls into poverty and hardship.

Dependence, infirmity, and timidity—three traits inferior to others—yet through them one attains success.
**Commentary:** *Yuánxún* refers to one who leans on things to walk. *Yǎnyǎng* describes one unable to bend and grasp. *Kùnwèi* denotes one who is cowardly and weak. Since these three are unfit for active service, they are instead employed in auxiliary roles, hence their certain success.
**Subcommentary:** *Xún* means compliance—relying on others and following them, unable to stand alone. *Yǎnyǎng* describes one who holds their head high and cannot stoop to take hold of things. *Kùnwèi* refers to distress and fear. Possessing these three traits, inferior to ordinary people, one nevertheless attains success wherever they go.

Wisdom that extends outward,
**Commentary:** Extending outward harms the inner self by its boundlessness.
**Subcommentary:** Relying on one’s intelligence to illuminate things, one connects outwardly with the dusty world.

Bravery that stirs action breeds resentment,
**Commentary:** Only timidity and stillness truly preserve the self.
**Subcommentary:** Vigor and restlessness inevitably invite enmity.

Benevolence and righteousness invite many reproaches,
**Commentary:** The world expects universal love, yet love cannot be all-encompassing—hence the many reproaches.
**Subcommentary:** Benevolence and righteousness, being incomplete, must incur many demands.

Those who grasp the essence of life are *kuǐ*,
**Commentary:** *Kuǐrán* describes a state of great tranquility and release.
Those who grasp knowledge are *xiāo*;
**Commentary:** *Xiāo* means dissolution and dispersal.
**Subcommentary:** The commentary states: *Xiāo* is dissolution and dispersal; *kuǐ* is tranquility and release. At the summit of enlightenment, the true nature shines in emptiness, *kuǐrán* suspended in liberation, free from attachment.

Those who grasp the great mandate follow,
**Commentary:** They merge indistinguishably with transformation.
**Subcommentary:** The *great mandate* refers to great longevity. Even one like Pengzu, blessed with long life, follows and yields to it, never wearying of its duration or deeming it a burden.

Those who grasp the small mandate encounter,
**Commentary:** They awaken only when resting at the proper juncture.
**Subcommentary:** The *small mandate* refers to short lifespan. *Encounter* means to meet. Like a child who dies young, one meets their fate without distress.

There was a man who gained an audience with the King of Song and was granted ten chariots. With these ten chariots, he grew arrogant and relegated Zhuangzi to a lower rank.
**Subcommentary:** *Xī* means to grant; *hòu* means to place after. During the reign of King Xiang of Song, a mediocre man traveled to Song and deceived the king with empty words, receiving ten chariots in reward. Using these, he flaunted his superiority, pushing Zhuangzi behind him and boasting of his precedence.

Zhuangzi said: By the river lived a poor family who wove reed mats for a living. Their son dived into the depths and found a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him: Bring a stone and smash it! For a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces must lie in the ninefold abyss beneath the chin of a black dragon. That you could obtain it means you must have encountered the dragon while it slept. Had the black dragon been awake, what trace of you would remain?
**Subcommentary:** *Wěi* refers to reeds; *xiāo* to mugwort. The poor family wove mats from reeds and mugwort to sell for food. *Duàn* means to hammer. *Lí* is the black dragon, beneath whose chin lies a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. This parable mocks the man who gained the chariots. The depths of the state of Song are not merely a ninefold abyss; the ferocity of the King of Song surpasses even that of a black dragon. That you could obtain the chariots means you must have encountered him while he slept. Had the King of Song been awake, you would have been ground to powder.
**Commentary:** To acquire wealth and honor, one must align with the people’s expectations. If one clings to strange doctrines, rides the celestial thoroughfare, and ensnares the ruler’s heart, a wise lord will not accept it. Thus, if there is praise, there must be testing. If one does not betray the people’s trust and is universally acclaimed as meeting the hopes of all, this is how the Three Dynasties conducted themselves with uprightness.
**Subcommentary:** Those who harbor loyalty and sincerity to move their ruler will receive extraordinary rewards. But those who employ devious methods, flatter the ruler with clever words, and seek fortune through luck will display arrogance and disdain. How is this different from encountering a sleeping black dragon and obtaining a pearl? The rest is explained in the commentary.

Someone once sought to employ Zhuangzi.

**Subcommentary:** This is a parable, for the surname and clan of the one extending the invitation are not specified, hence the use of "someone."

Zhuangzi responded to the messenger, saying: "Have you seen the sacrificial ox? The ox is fed for three days beforehand to be used in the ancestral temple sacrifices. Clothed in embroidered brocade and fed with fine grass and beans, when it is led into the grand temple, though it might wish to be a lone calf, could it ever be so?"

**Commentary:** Those who delight in life fear the sacrificial fate and decline such appointments. The skull, hearing of life, knits its brows in dismay—such is the difference in feelings between life and death, each fitting in its own way.

**Subcommentary:** *Chu* refers to grass, and *shu* to beans. Though the sacrificial ox is richly nourished, when the day of sacrifice arrives, it cannot become a lone calf. How much more so for those who feed on official stipends, who often meet early deaths, while those who retreat in noble seclusion fully preserve their lives? Zhuangzi, lofty and pure, mocked the pursuit of fame and profit.

When Zhuangzi was about to die, his disciples wished to give him a lavish burial. Zhuangzi said: "I take heaven and earth as my inner and outer coffins, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars and constellations as my pearls and beads, and the myriad things as my funeral gifts. Are my burial rites not already complete? What more could be added?"

**Subcommentary:** Zhuangzi, profoundly attuned to the mysterious Dao, regarded his body as a temporary lodging. Thus, he took heaven and earth as his coffins, the two primal forces as his crucible, the stars and constellations as his pearls and beads, and the three luminaries as his transformations—his funeral provisions were fully prepared. For his disciples to insist on a lavish burial was deeply contrary to the workings of creation.

The disciples said: "We fear that crows and kites will feed on you, Master."

Zhuangzi replied: "Above, crows and kites will feed on me; below, ants will feed on me. To take from one to give to the other—how partial is that!"

**Subcommentary:** *Yuan* refers to the kite. The disciples, bearing the deep kindness of their teacher, wished to bury him lavishly to avoid the crows and kites, yet they did not realize that a lavish burial would only expose him to ants. Their affection led them to partiality in their choices.

"To use imbalance to create balance—such balance is not true balance."

**Commentary:** To impose one’s own sense of balance upon the myriad things is not as good as allowing the myriad things to find their own balance.

**Subcommentary:** Without partiality in giving or taking, entrusting all to impartiality—this is true balance. But if one applies one’s own thoughts to balance the myriad things, the moment one sets one’s mind to it, imbalance arises.

"To use the unconvincing to convince—such convincing is not truly convincing."

**Commentary:** *Zheng* means "response." Not following the natural responses of the myriad things but instead imposing one’s own views upon them will inevitably lead to discord.

**Subcommentary:** The sage, without preconceived intent, responds to stimuli—this is true responsiveness. If one responds with a preconceived mind, one cannot truly respond. *Zheng* means "response."

"The enlightened are but servants of things."

**Commentary:** Those who cling to their own views are often used by things—how can they use things?

**Subcommentary:** Those who flaunt their enlightenment and respond to affairs with their emotions are driven and used by things—how can they use others?

"Only the spiritually attuned can truly respond."

**Commentary:** Only by entrusting oneself to the spirit can one reach the utmost, thus responding without fail.

**Subcommentary:** The spiritually attuned, without preconceived intent and unmoving in stillness, can respond to all without exception.

"That the enlightened cannot surpass the spiritually attuned has long been so."

**Commentary:** The reach of enlightenment does not extend beyond the physical form. Yet when one attains perfect compliance, there is no distance too far or depth too profound—all things find their own fulfillment.

**Subcommentary:** Enlightenment involves responding to affairs with a preconceived mind, driven and used by things. The spiritually attuned, without preconceived intent, respond to stimuli without limitation. Having a mind cannot compare to being without one; responding with intent cannot compare to responding without intent—this is readily apparent.

"Yet the foolish rely on their own views to influence others, their achievements external—is this not lamentable?"

**Commentary:** When one attains perfect compliance, one’s actions arise from others yet remain hidden within things. But if one clings to one’s own views and insists on being right, though one may wish to influence others, one’s achievements remain external.

**Subcommentary:** Those who respond without attachment act without claiming credit, achieving success without dwelling on it. The foolish, however, cling to their own usefulness, appropriating others’ achievements as their own. Though they may wish to boast, their achievements remain external. Such delusion is deeply lamentable.

*Commentary by Guo Xiang of Henan*

**Subcommentary by Master Cheng Xuanying of the Tang, Western Florescence**
*Miscellaneous Chapters: "The World" (Chapter Thirty-Three)*

The governance and arts of the world are manifold, each claiming its active methods cannot be surpassed.

*[Annotation]*
If one acts through *having* (有為), it is true action; if it is true action, there is no falsity—what more could be added?

*[Subcommentary]*
*Fāng* (方) means the Dao. From Zhuanxu down to Yao and Shun, the arts of governance and methods of rule were numerous. All followed the nature of existing things, aligning with their inherent tendencies, allowing the myriad beings to grow and move without imposing external distinctions. Thus, though they taught, it was as if they did not teach; though they acted, it was as if they did not act.

Where, then, does the so-called *Dao*-art of antiquity reside?

*[Subcommentary]*
The *Dao*-art practiced by the Three Sovereigns of high antiquity—following things, letting transformations unfold, pure and without contrivance—where is this method to be found? This hypothetical question illuminates a profound principle.

It is said: There is nowhere it is not.

*[Subcommentary]*
The answer: The wondrous Dao of non-action exists everywhere. From ancient times to the present, there is no place it does not pervade.

It is asked: By what means does the numinous descend? By what means does illumination emerge?

*[Annotation]*
The numinous and illumination descend and emerge in response to affairs.

*[Subcommentary]*
*Shén* (神) is the name for the wondrous; *míng* (明) signifies all-pervading wisdom. If the empty and penetrating sagely Dao has existed from ancient times to the present, why would those numinous beings need to manifest this luminous wisdom, establishing rites and music to guide the world?

The sagely arise from something; kings achieve through something.

*[Subcommentary]*
The empty and congealed wondrous Dao gives birth to things in response to their resonance. The sagely emperors and enlightened kings descend and manifest their traces to accomplish their works—how could this be in vain?

All originate from the One.

*[Annotation]*
If things each return to their root and embrace the One, with no adornment on the outside, this is how the sagely and kingly arise and achieve.

*[Subcommentary]*
*Yuán* (原) means root; *yī* (一) is the Dao. Though they descend in spirit to engage with things, blending their light and harmonizing their manifestations, they respond to things without departing from true constancy, embracing the One and returning to the root.

Not departing from the source is called the *heavenly person*.
Not departing from the essence is called the *numinous person*.
Not departing from the real is called the *perfected person*.
Taking heaven as their source, virtue as their root, and the Dao as their gate, foreseeing transformations, they are called *sages*.

*[Annotation]*
These four names refer to one and the same person; they differ only in how they are described.

*[Subcommentary]*
Merging with the source and uniting with the root is called *natural*. Pure and unadulterated is called *numinous*. Unwavering and uncontrived is called *perfected*. Taking the natural as their source, supreme virtue as their root, and the wondrous Dao as their gate, observing signs and adapting to things’ transformations, they are called *sages*. The four types above are but one; they are named differently according to their functions.

Taking benevolence as kindness, righteousness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony, suffused with compassion and kindness, they are called *noble persons*.

*[Annotation]*
These four names denote coarse traces, which worthy and noble persons embrace.

*[Subcommentary]*
Dispensing the seven virtues as grace, applying righteousness and principle to correct wrongs, employing ritual propriety as the foundation of conduct, and moving with music to harmonize the nature—radiating compassion across the nine provinces, fanning the winds of benevolence in all eight directions, like orchids and irises whose fragrance perfumes near and far—this may be called worthy.

Taking law as division, names as markers, verification as confirmation, and investigation as decision—such are the numbers one, two, three, and four.

*[Subcommentary]*
*Jī* (稽) means to examine; *cāo* (參) means to grasp. Law defines divisions, names mark reality, verification confirms conduct, and investigation decides ability. The numbers one, two, three, and four correspond to names, laws, and the like.

Officials rank one another by these, taking affairs as their constant.

*[Subcommentary]*
From Yao and Shun onward, the hundred officials were established. Using these four methods, they ranked one another in order. The duties of ruler and minister became their norm—what is called the constant principles of human relations.

Taking clothing and food as their primary concern, multiplying, rearing, and storing,

*[Subcommentary]*
Of affairs that cannot be abandoned, farming and weaving are foremost; of the sagely, clothing and food are indispensable. Thus, the state takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven. Therefore, multiplying, nurturing life, accumulating, and storing are all methods of nourishing the people.

Caring for the elderly, the weak, the orphaned, and the widowed—all are provided for. This is the governance of the people.

*[Annotation]*
Since the governance of the people is thus, the sagely and worthy do not oppose it.

The people of antiquity were truly complete.

*[Annotation]*
The people of antiquity refer to these four types.

*[Subcommentary]*
Caring for the elderly, pitying the weak, compassionating the orphaned, and aiding the widowed—from the Five Emperors onward, all have practiced this.

They matched the numinous and bright, purified heaven and earth, nurtured the myriad things, and harmonized the world.

*[Subcommentary]*
*Pèi* (配) means to join. The sagely emperors, without intent, followed the nature of things. Thus, they could unite with the wondrous principle of the numinous and bright, align with the purity of heaven and earth, nurture the common people within the realm, and harmonize the myriad beings under heaven.

Their blessings extended to the hundred clans. Illuminating the root numbers, they connected to the branch measures.

*[Annotation]*
When the root numbers are illuminated, the branches do not depart.

*[Subcommentary]*
The root numbers are benevolence and righteousness; the branch measures are names and laws. The sagely heart, compassionate and nurturing, overflows with grace toward the common people. Thus, they illuminate benevolence and righteousness to exalt the root and connect to names and laws to rescue the branches.

The six directions and four openings, the great and small, the refined and coarse—their movements are nowhere absent.

*[Annotation]*
This is what it means to be complete.

*[Subcommentary]*
*Bì* (辟) means method. Great as the two modes (yin and yang), small as the myriad things, refined as spirit and wisdom, coarse as form and image—they roam through the six directions, transform in accord with the four seasons, moving with the moment, nowhere absent.

As for their illumination within numbers and measures, the old laws and transmitted records of historians still abound.

The manifestations within numbers and measures that can be made evident, though many remain, are already coarse and external.

*[Subcommentary]*
The *Annals* (*Chunqiu*) and *Book of Documents* (*Shangshu*) are both ancient histories. "Numbers and measures" refer to benevolence, righteousness, laws, and names. What has been handed down from antiquity and remains manifest in the world—historical records and transmitted texts—still abound. As for those found in the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, scholars of Zou and Lu, the girdled gentlemen, are largely able to elucidate them.

*[Annotation]*
They can elucidate their traces, but how could these be the essence of the traces?

*[Subcommentary]*
Zou is the name of a city; Lu, the name of a state. *Jin* (搢) refers to the tablet, or to insert; *shen* (绅), the sash. *Xiansheng* (先生) are the Confucian scholars. This says that benevolence, righteousness, names, and laws, as laid out in the *Six Classics*, are made clear by the scholars of Zou and Lu, men of the Confucian garb. The *Odes* convey the will, the *Documents* convey affairs, the *Rites* convey conduct, the *Music* conveys harmony, the *Changes* conveys yin and yang, and the *Annals* conveys names and distinctions.

*[Subcommentary]*
*Dao* (道) means to reach or to penetrate. The *Odes* convey emotions and intentions, the *Documents* convey worldly affairs, the *Rites* convey the conduct of the heart, the *Music* conveys harmony and ease, the *Changes* clarify hexagrams and omens, penetrating yin and yang, and the *Annals* praise and blame, fixing names and distinctions. These principles, scattered throughout the world and established in the Middle Kingdom, are at times expounded and conveyed by the schools of the Hundred Masters.

*[Annotation]*
They all convey the traces of the ancients, yet even these cannot always be upheld.

*[Subcommentary]*
The traces of the *Six Classics* are scattered throughout the realm, but the reach of their transformative influence does not extend beyond the central lands. The Hundred Schools and various masters, vaguely following the Five Virtues, occasionally expound upon them, yet cannot achieve great unity. When the world falls into great disorder,

*[Annotation]*
it is because they employ the traces without a unifying principle.

*[Subcommentary]*
Clinging to the traces of the past, they cannot attain peace. When the sagely and worthy remain obscure,

*[Annotation]*
to elucidate their traces is no easy task.

*[Subcommentary]*
They conceal their brilliance and hide their traces. When the Dao and virtue are not unified,

*[Annotation]*
the Hundred Schools force their interpretations.

*[Subcommentary]*
Their teachings and methods are manifold. People of the world each grasp one part,

*[Annotation]*
each believing in their own partial view and unable to embrace the whole.

*[Subcommentary]*
Scholars throughout the realm are each bound to their own attachments, grasping but a single art—how could they achieve vast comprehension? They examine and take delight in their own preferences.

*[Annotation]*
The sage unifies the great sentiments of the people and thereby establishes systems, so the people entrust their sentiments to what is unified and forget their own likes and dislikes, thus attaining harmony with their age in tranquil indifference. In disorder, the reverse occurs: people indulge their immediate preferences, households apply their own codes, so states adopt different policies and households follow distinct customs.

*[Subcommentary]*
Unable to attain tranquil indifference and emptiness, they instead employ their minds to scrutinize, following their own inclinations to devise teachings. It is like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth, each possessing its own clarity yet unable to communicate with one another.

*[Subcommentary]*
The eye can see colors but cannot hear sounds; the nose can smell fragrances but cannot discern tastes. Each has its own function and thus cannot communicate. It is like the various arts of the Hundred Schools, each possessing its own strength and at times serving a purpose.

*[Annotation]*
Their strengths differ and cannot be constantly employed.

*[Subcommentary]*
The Five Virtues of the *Six Classics* and the various teachings of the Hundred Schools each have their strengths in saving the world, yet since they do not align with the Dao, they are at times discarded, like the nose and mouth that cannot always communicate. Nevertheless, they are not comprehensive or all-encompassing—these are the scholars of one corner.

*[Annotation]*
Thus, they are not sufficient for full responsibility.

*[Subcommentary]*
Though each possesses its own strength, they cannot achieve thorough comprehension or universal reach. These are the biased scholars, the people of partiality, not those of rounded penetration and harmonious adaptability. They divide the beauty of Heaven and Earth, dissect the principles of the myriad things,

*[Annotation]*
each employing but one corner, thus dividing and dissecting.

*[Subcommentary]*
The people of one corner, each clinging to their biases, though they establish their methods, cannot unite with the Dao. Thus, they scatter the pure harmony of the Two Modes and sever the empty penetration of the myriad things. Examining the wholeness of the ancients, few can embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of spirit and illumination.

*[Annotation]*
How much less can those of one corner?

*[Subcommentary]*
Observing the ancient people of complete virtue, they could still embody the nurturing of the Two Modes and match the countenance of spirit and illumination—how much less can the people of one corner? Therefore, the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship grows dim and unclear, pent up and unexpressed.

*[Annotation]*
This is because the complete person is rarely encountered.

*[Subcommentary]*
The mysterious sage and the uncrowned king represent inner sageliness; the soaring dragon at the ninth-five, outer kingship. Yet when the Hundred Schools arose in competition, each prizing their own views, right and wrong became confused, and disputes between self and other proliferated. Thus, the Way of withdrawal and engagement grew dark and obstructed, pent up and unexpressed. People of the world each followed their own desires to devise their own methods. Alas! The Hundred Schools have gone forth and do not return—they will surely not unite.

*[Subcommentary]*
What the heart desires, it grasps and enacts, taking these desires as methods. Once set upon things, they never return to the root—how could they attain unity with principle? Having strayed from the nature of things, this is deeply lamentable. Later scholars, unfortunately, do not witness the purity of Heaven and Earth or the great body of the ancients.

*[Annotation]*
The great body, when each returns to the root and embraces the One, is the purity of Heaven and Earth.

*[Subcommentary]*
*Xing* (幸) means to encounter. The purity of Heaven and Earth is non-action; the great body of the ancients is simplicity. This says that people of later ages, living in this decadent era, do not witness the Way of non-action or encounter the age of simplicity. The arts of the Dao will be torn asunder throughout the world.

*[Annotation]*
Torn asunder means divided.

The corruptions of the Dao arts led each to champion their own methods. Some, by making things their master, caused things to depart from their nature and submit to external control, thus losing both nature and destiny.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Torn asunder" means divided. Confucians, Mohists, Logicians, and Legalists each raced forward, each prizing their own views, all following their own inclinations. The Dao arts became tangled and conflicting, mutually deceiving and outdoing one another, leaving the common people with no place to set their hearts. The division of the One Nature truly arose from this.

They did not indulge in extravagance for later generations, nor did they lavish upon the myriad things, nor did they shine through the measures and standards.

*[Annotation]*
Diligence and frugality lead to exhaustion, hence they did not shine.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Extravagance" means excess. "Lavish" means adornment. "Shine" means clarity. Teaching later generations, they did not permit luxury; in their dealings with things and self, they were utterly frugal, never indulging in ornate splendor. Having strayed from the nature of things, their teachings and methods could not prevail, and thus the classical rites of the former kings did not become manifest in the world.

They used the carpenter’s line to correct themselves.

*[Annotation]*
"Correct" means to discipline.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Correct" means to discipline. They used benevolence and righteousness as the carpenter’s line to discipline and refine their aspirations and conduct.

And prepared for the world’s emergencies.

*[Annotation]*
Acting with frugality leaves wealth in surplus, hence emergencies are provided for.

*[Subcommentary]*
"World’s emergencies" refer to the disasters of the Nine Suns, Hundred and Six, water, and fire. Through diligence, frugality, and moderation in use, they stored and accumulated wealth to prepare for the world’s calamities and urgent difficulties.

There were aspects of the Dao arts of antiquity present in this. Mo Di and Qin Guli heard of this trend and delighted in it, carrying it to excess, making themselves its greatest exemplars.

*[Annotation]*
They no longer measured what the multitude could bear.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Exemplars" means to follow. The Dao arts of antiquity—Yu’s governance of the floods, his diligence, frugality, and emaciation—left traces still present, hence it is said there were aspects present in this. Qin, by surname, styled Guli, was a disciple of Mo Di. Mo Di and Guli, by nature fond of diligence and frugality, hearing of Yu’s teachings, deeply delighted in and loved them. They devoted themselves to this Way, acting with excessive hardship, conforming only to themselves, unable to extend their teachings to others.

They composed *Against Music* and titled it *Moderation in Use*. In life, they did not sing; in death, they wore no mourning.

*[Subcommentary]*
*Against Music* and *Moderation in Use* are two chapter titles in the *Mozi*. "In life, they did not sing" is why they opposed music; "in death, they wore no mourning" is why they advocated moderation in use—meaning they had no funeral garments, shrouds, coffins, or outer coffins, expressing their extreme frugality and惜费.

Mozi universally loved and benefited all, opposing warfare among states.

*[Annotation]*
When things are insufficient, deficiency is deemed correct. Now, Mozi commands the people to all be diligent and frugal, each having surplus, hence he opposes conflict.

*[Subcommentary]*
Universally loving and benefiting all beings, he made each self-sufficient, hence eliminating strife and deeming conflict wrong.

His Way did not involve anger.

*[Annotation]*
He merely disciplined himself.

*[Subcommentary]*
Disciplining himself with diligence and frugality, he did not resent or grow angry at things.

He also loved learning and was broadly knowledgeable, without distinction.

*[Annotation]*
Having already taken himself as correct, he wished all things to be the same as himself.

*[Subcommentary]*
Mozi also loved learning, mastering the ancient classics. Having already practiced diligence and frugality himself, he wished others to be the same.

He did not align with the former kings, destroying the rites and music of antiquity.

*[Annotation]*
The former kings allowed their multitude of differences to flourish, then harmonized them so all were satisfied without knowing why.

*[Subcommentary]*
Rites involve gradations of refinement and restraint; music involves bells, drums, feathers, and plumes. Deeming them extravagant and luxurious, he destroyed and abandoned them.

The Yellow Emperor had *Xianchi*, Yao had *Great Chapter*, Shun had *Great Shao*, Yu had *Great Xia*, Tang had *Great Hu*, King Wen had the music of the *Biyong*, and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou composed *Wu*.

*[Subcommentary]*
The above are the names of the music of the Five Emperors and Three Kings.

The mourning rites of antiquity had ceremonies for the noble and base, ranks for the high and low. The Son of Heaven had seven layers of inner and outer coffins, the feudal lords five, the great officers three, and the officers two.

*[Subcommentary]*
From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, all had their ceremonies and laws, each with their own gradations—these were the rites of antiquity.

Now, Mozi alone did not sing in life and wore no mourning in death, using a paulownia coffin three inches thick without an outer coffin as his model. Teaching others in this way, he risked not loving them.

With this as his own practice, he surely did not love himself.

*[Annotation]*
All things love by exerting their strength and following their nature. Now, taking frugality as the model and carrying it to excess is, though one may wish to enrich the world, precisely what is not love.

*[Subcommentary]*
Following in Yu’s footsteps, he was frugal to excess. Above, this departed from the Three Kings; below, it ran counter to the myriad people. Thus, in life and death, he toiled in hardship, unable to nurture external things. His form and countenance withered—this could not be called love for his own person.

This is the ruin of Mozi’s Way.

*[Annotation]*
It is simply not the Dao and virtue.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Ruin" means "nothingness." Mo Di’s nature inclined toward the ideas of Yi Yin and Laozi.

Yet though he sang, it was not singing; though he wept, it was not weeping; though he rejoiced, it was not joy—was this truly akin to others?

*[Annotation]*
Though he alone formed the Mohist school, he did not resemble the feelings of the myriad things.

*[Subcommentary]*
To sing in life and weep in death is the constant principle of human relations; to mourn in misfortune and rejoice in good fortune is the great sentiment of the world. Now, he reversed these—thus, he was not merely different.

In life, he toiled; in death, he was meager. His Way was greatly parched.

*[Annotation]*
"Parched" means "without moisture."

*[Subcommentary]*
"Parched" means "without moisture." In life, he wearied body and mind; in death, his burial resources were scant. His Way was dry and without moisture.

He caused people to worry, caused people to grieve. His conduct was difficult to sustain. I fear it cannot be the Way of the sage.

*[Annotation]*
The sage’s Way delights and thereby moves the people. When the people attain what their natures delight in, they are pleased, and when they are pleased, the world has no difficulties.

*[Subcommentary]*
The sage’s Way wins the hearts of the hundred clans. Now, he caused things to worry and grieve, made his conduct difficult to endure, and left no moisture—thus, it cannot be used to teach the world.

He opposed the hearts of the world, and the world could not bear it. Though Mozi alone could endure it, what could he do about the world? Separated from the world, he was far from kingship.

*[Annotation]*
One who would be king must unite the world’s hearts and go forth with things.

*[Subcommentary]*
To rule the world, one must empty the heart and forget the self, greatly following the multitudes. Now, he destroyed the laws of the august kings and opposed the nature of the black-haired people—was he not far from ruling things?

Mozi spoke of the Way, saying: In ancient times, Yu dammed the floodwaters, dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and opened the way to the four barbarians and the nine provinces. The great rivers numbered three hundred, their tributaries three thousand, and the smaller ones were beyond count.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Dammed" means "blocked." In ancient times, Yao suffered the flood and commanded Yu to regulate the waters. He set up blockages and embankments, dredged the rivers and streams, rescuing from the disaster of the hundred and six, and sowing the nine grains.

Yu personally wielded the basket and spade, nine times traversing the rivers of the world.

*[Subcommentary]*
The basket was a vessel for carrying earth; the spade, a tool for digging. Yu grasped the spade to dig the earth, carried the basket to bear the soil, and toiled in person to guide the rivers and plains. Thus, boats and oars came and went, and the nine provinces exchanged goods.

*[Alternative explanation]*
In ancient times, characters were few: *di* 涤 was used for *dang* 荡 ("to scour"), and *chuan* 川 for *yuan* 原 ("plains"). "Nine times" means the nine directions.

*[Another version]*
The character was originally written as *jiu* 鸠 ("to gather"), meaning to gather and dredge the rivers and valleys to guide the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers.

His calves had no flesh, his shins no hair. He washed in heavy rain and combed his hair in fierce winds, establishing the ten thousand states. Yu was a great sage, and his physical toil for the world was like this.

*[Annotation]*
Mozi saw only Yu’s physical toil but did not perceive the harmony of his nature.

*[Subcommentary]*
In dredging the hundred rivers and establishing the ten thousand states, hearing of Qi’s birth, he had no time for a brief visit. Passing his gate three times, he could not see his son. He relied on torrential rain to wash his hair and fierce winds to comb it. Constantly toiling and laboring, his form and countenance were worn and haggard, so that his calves and thighs had no flesh, and his knees and shins no hair. Yu’s Way was sagely, yet he himself endured hardship—how much more should we, the ordinary and mediocre, toil without ceasing?

Thus, later Mohists wore coarse garments of fur and hemp, and sandals of wood and grass. Day and night they did not rest, taking self-imposed suffering as their ultimate principle.

*[Annotation]*
They took self-imposed suffering as the perfect method of principle.

*[Subcommentary]*
Coarse garments of fur and hemp, wooden sandals and grass shoes—these were frugal. Working day and night without rest—this was exertion. Using these to impose suffering on themselves was the ultimate subtlety of principle.

They said: If one cannot be like this, it is not Yu’s Way and is insufficient to be called Mohist.

*[Annotation]*
To hold to this Way when it is not the time is what makes one Mohist.

*[Subcommentary]*
The Mohists were Yu’s distant descendants. Thus, those who could not endure hardship and departed from Yu’s Way could not be called Mohist.

Xiangli Qin’s disciples, the followers of Wu Hou, the southern Mohists Ku Huo and Ji Chi, Deng Lingzi and their like—all recited the *Mo Jing* but differed in their deviations and deceptions, calling one another "heterodox Mohists."

*[Annotation]*
Since each held to their own views, there was no communication anywhere. Thus, within Mohism, they further distinguished themselves from one another.

*[Subcommentary]*
Xiangli, named Qin, was a Mohist master of the south. Ku Huo, Wu Hou, and their like were all Mohist scholars. "Deviations" means "differences." Though they all recited the *Mo Jing*, they further differed from one another, calling each other "heterodox Mohists."

They criticized one another with debates on the hard and white, the same and different; they responded to one another with arguments of the odd and even, the matched and unmatched. They took the *juzi* as sages.

*[Annotation]*
The *juzi* was most able to distinguish what was right and perfect his conduct.

*[Subcommentary]*
"Criticized" means "slandered." *Ju* means "great." Singular arguments were called *qi* (odd); paired debates were called *ou* (even). *Wu* means "order." Deng Lingzi and his followers practiced Mohist techniques, stubbornly holding to the hard and white, each flaunting their abilities, merging differences into sameness, and splitting sameness into differences.

Some sang alone with few in harmony; others took turns as guest and host, exchanging words. They slandered one another with debates on being and non-being, right and wrong; they responded with disordered arguments. Those most diligent and frugal were hailed as sages. All wished to serve as their *shi*—

*[Annotation]*
*Shi* means "master."

—hoping to become their successors. Even now, their disputes remain unresolved.

*[Annotation]*
They desired to inherit the legacy of the *juzi*.

*[Subcommentary]*
All longed to be the master-teacher, hoping to transmit their teachings to posterity. Yet their contentious battles over victory and defeat could never be settled.

The intentions of Mo Di and Qin Guli were sound—

*[Annotation]*
Their aim was to avoid extravagance and prepare for the world’s emergencies; this is why they were correct.

—but their conduct was wrong.

*[Annotation]*
They carried it too far.

*[Subcommentary]*
Their intent was to save others, which was right; but their excessive frugality was wrong. They would have later Mohists necessarily torment themselves, advancing only by emaciating their calves and wearing away their body hair.

This is the height of disorder—

*[Annotation]*
No disorder is greater than acting against things and harming one’s nature.

—and the lowest form of governance.

*[Annotation]*
The highest governance follows the multitude and accords with nature; the Mohists do the opposite, hence they are the lowest.

*[Subcommentary]*
The Dao of Mozi goes against things and harms nature, making it the lowest art of governance and the foremost cause of chaos.

Yet Mozi was truly one who loved the world—

*[Annotation]*
For he genuinely revered the sage-kings and did not act contrary to them, though his teachings could not be followed.

—his pursuit was unrelenting.

*[Annotation]*
Without equal.

Even when withered and gaunt, he did not abandon it.

*[Annotation]*
This is what made his love genuine.

*[Subcommentary]*
In all the world, only he loved frugality. Seeking his like, he could find none. Though so emaciated, he never ceased, for his nature was truly devoted—not feigned. He was a man of talent indeed!

*[Annotation]*
He was not a man of virtue.

*[Subcommentary]*
Alas! Though he acted against things and harmed nature, truly not a sage, he was still a man of talent, diligent and frugal, who sought to save the world.

Unburdened by custom, unadorned by things, uncompromising with others, unopposed to the multitude—

*[Annotation]*
*Zhi* means "to oppose."

*[Subcommentary]*
Free from the burdens of custom, unfeigning toward things, unyielding to others, uncontentious with the crowd, he stood by his name and conduct to nurture the common people.

He wished for the world’s peace to preserve lives, ceasing only when all—self and others—had enough.

*[Annotation]*
He dared not hope for surplus.

With this, he purified his heart. In this lay an ancient art of the Dao.

*[Subcommentary]*
Ever desiring the world’s tranquility to save the black-haired people, frugal in both self and others, knowing contentment—with this teaching, he purified his heart. An ancient art of the Dao resided in this, passed down without cease.

Song Jian and Yin Wen heard of his spirit and delighted in it.

*[Subcommentary]*
Song, named Jian; Yin, named Wen—both were men of King Xuan of Qi’s time, who studied together at Jixia. Song wrote one chapter, Yin two, both taking the common people as their teachers and naming their teachings accordingly. Their natures aligned with his teachings, so they heard of his spirit and rejoiced.

They fashioned the *Huashan* cap as their emblem—

*[Annotation]*
The Huashan cap is even above and below.

[Subcommentary]
Huashan’s form is like a sheer cliff, even above and below. Song and Yin, aspiring to lofty purity, fashioned it into a cap to mark their distinctive virtue.

They engaged with the myriad things, beginning with *separate enclosures*—

[Annotation]
Not desiring mutual encroachment.

[Subcommentary]
*Enclosures* means boundaries. *Beginning* means foundation. In establishing their teachings to respond to the world, they distinguished the ten thousand existences, taking this as their root.

The bearing of the heart they named *the heart’s conduct*—

[Subcommentary]
*Named* means designated. In speech and utterance, they always let the heart’s bearing embrace the myriad things, calling this receptivity *the heart’s conduct*.

With harmony they joined in joy, with regulation they harmonized the world—

[Annotation]
Forcibly harmonizing with their Way to bring union, adjusting to create peace.

They requested to establish this as the master—

[Annotation]
The two masters requested that one who embodied this be made the master of things.

[Subcommentary]
With this teaching they harmonized and regulated the Four Seas, hoping to unite all in joyful accord, establishing such a person as the master of things.

They endured insult without shame—

[Annotation]
Their urgency lay in saving the people.

They rescued the people from strife, forbade attack and stilled weapons, saving the world from war—

[Annotation]
This is what is meant by harmonizing and regulating.

[Subcommentary]
*Stilled* means ceased. Preventing aggression and halting warfare, their intent lay in reconciliation, forbidding combat. Even if mocked and humiliated, they took no offense, their purpose being to save the world—this was why.

With this they traversed the world, persuading above and instructing below. Though the world did not accept it, they clamored insistently without ceasing—

[Annotation]
This is the principle of harmonizing and regulating.

[Subcommentary]
With this teaching they transformed the Nine Provinces, persuading rulers above and instructing the common people below. Though the world rejected it, they pressed on with vehement exhortation, never abandoning their cause.

Thus it is said: above and below found them wearisome, yet they forced themselves forward—

[Annotation]
This is what is meant by enduring insult without shame.

[Subcommentary]
Though all found them contemptible, they still pressed forward to exhort others—this is what is meant by bearing humiliation without shame.

Yet in this, they did too much for others and too little for themselves—

[Annotation]
Not waiting for others to transform naturally but forcibly consoling them, their burden was too heavy.

[Subcommentary]
Those who attain the Dao and the sages respond only after being moved, first cultivating themselves before others. Now, by constantly pressing others and enduring rejection without cease, they exhausted themselves—was this not doing too little for themselves?

They said: We request only to set aside five *sheng* of rice—this is enough.

[Annotation]
This clarifies how little they did for themselves.

The master feared not being full, while the disciples, though hungry, never forgot the world—

[Annotation]
Song Jian and Yin Wen called the common people *master* and referred to themselves as *disciples*.

[Subcommentary]
Song and Yin called the black-haired people *master* and themselves *disciples*, putting others before themselves.

Their advance was unobstructed, their intent lying in diligence and frugality. Setting aside five *sheng* of rice for a day’s meal, they feared only the people’s hunger, not their own starvation. Never forgetting the world, they took this as their heart, diligently and frugally nourishing the common people. Following this method, they toiled day and night without rest.

Day and night they did not rest, saying: We must surely bring life!

[Annotation]
They meant that the people would repay them.

How towering were these saviors of the world!

[Annotation]
The bearing of one who thrusts aside all with lofty grandeur.

[Subcommentary]
*Towering* describes their lofty bearing. Their strength endured hardship as they aided and rescued the black-haired people. Though not yet aligned with the Dao, they could be called saviors of the world.

They said: The noble person does not engage in petty scrutiny—

[Annotation]
They devoted themselves to magnanimity.

[Subcommentary]
The worthy and noble person, forgiving and tolerant, never employs a mind of acceptance and rejection to scrutinize things.

Nor does he lend himself to things—

[Annotation]
He must exert his own strength.

[Subcommentary]
He establishes himself and seeks within, not relying on things to achieve fame.

They held that what brought no benefit to the world was better left unilluminated—

[Annotation]
This is why they were saviors of the world.

[Subcommentary]
*Left* means ceased. With toil of heart and strain of body, they contravened the Dao and opposed things. Since this brought no benefit to the world, it was better to cease than to proceed.

They took forbidding attack and stilling weapons as external—

[Subcommentary]
For the benefit of others, an external practice.

And taking desires to be few and shallow as internal—

[Subcommentary]
For self-benefit, an internal practice.

Their teachings, whether grand or fine, coarse or refined, extended only to this point and no further—

[Annotation]
They had not yet traversed emptiness or ventured into vastness.

[Subcommentary]
Benefiting self and others, internal and external practices—though differing in scale and varying in refinement, their guiding principles and essentials went no further than this.

Impartial yet not partisan, easygoing yet without bias, decisive yet without a fixed master—

[Annotation]
Each followed its own course.

[Subcommentary]
Impartial yet not partisan, level yet without partiality, deciding by principle without a fixed arbiter—this is what is meant by *law*, which lies herein.

They pursued things without duality—

[Annotation]
Things attained their proper pursuit, hence unity.

[Subcommentary]
Their intent lay in the pursuit of principle, not divided in regard to things.

Without regard for deliberation, without reliance on knowledge, without choosing among things, they proceeded with them all—

[Subcommentary]
Following principle and applying the law, they did not look ahead or behind, deciding with uprightness and without fear or deliberation. They did not employ knowledge or scheme beyond the law. Adhering to the law, they proceeded rigorously without selection.

An ancient art of the Dao resided in this—

[Subcommentary]
From the Five Emperors onward, there were those who governed by law as their art. Thus, traces worthy of esteem still remain in the world.

Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard of their spirit and delighted in it.

[Subcommentary]
By surname Peng, named Meng; by surname Tian, named Pian; by surname Shen, named Dao—all were recluses of Qi, who together frequented the Jixia Academy and each composed several chapters. Their natures accorded with the law, thus they heard of this spirit and delighted in it.

They took the equalization of the myriad things as their foremost principle, saying: Heaven can cover them but cannot bear them; Earth can bear them but cannot cover them; the great Dao can encompass them but cannot discriminate among them. Knowing that the myriad things each have what they can and cannot do, they said: selection is never all-encompassing.

[Annotation]
Only when all are employed is it complete.

[Subcommentary]
Heaven covers and Earth bears, each having its capacity; the great Dao embraces all yet does not discriminate. Thus, knowing the myriad things have their "can" and "cannot," one should follow their inherent dispositions and simply accord with them. If one seeks to select, it will inevitably be incomplete.

Teaching does not reach them;

[Annotation]
Only when one follows their nature does it attain.

The Dao leaves nothing behind.

[Subcommentary]
The myriad things differ, each endowed with distinct natures. To teach one with what belongs to another is far from the ultimate. But if one follows the profoundest Dao, then all things attain themselves without loss.

Therefore, Shen Dao discarded knowledge and abandoned the self, following only what could not be avoided. He refined and sifted things to establish his principle of the Dao.

[Annotation]
Refining and sifting mean letting things take their course.

[Subcommentary]
Refining and sifting mean selecting and tempering. Ceasing deliberation and discarding knowledge, forgetting the body and abandoning the self, responding only when compelled by circumstance, acting only upon stimulus—selecting and tempering right and wrong, deciding and judging according to the law—Shen Dao adhered to this as his principle of the Dao.

He said: to know what one does not know is to slight knowledge and then nearly harm it.

[Annotation]
This refers to shallow knowledge that does not entrust itself to spontaneity, thus slighting it and nearly causing harm.

[Subcommentary]
Knowledge has what it does not know, hence it is slight; though slight, it has not yet been entirely forgotten, thus it still nearly harms principle.

Unsteady and irresolute, he mocked the world’s esteem for worthies.

[Annotation]
Refusing to take up responsibility himself, he entrusted it to the multitude; if each of the multitude can act on their own, then there is no need to esteem worthies.

[Subcommentary]
Unsteady and irresolute: following things and according with circumstances, without fixed application. Each thing attains itself, without esteem for worthies or the capable, hence he mocked them.

Unrestrained and unprincipled, he denounced the world’s great sages.

[Annotation]
He sought to obliterate his traces so that things would not be ensnared.

[Subcommentary]
Indulgent and unconstrained, without the virtuous conduct of benevolence and righteousness, forgetting and leaving behind established traces, he thus denounced the sages of the world.

Crude and abrupt, yet pliable with things,

[Annotation]
Though the Legalist school was subtle, it remained crude and abrupt, thus not yet perfectly merged.

[Subcommentary]
Crude and abrupt: flogging and beating. Abrupt: carrying out punishments. Pliable: transforming. Again able to beat and punish, yet following the times, he could transform with things without rigidity.

Abandoning right and wrong, merely to avoid trouble,

[Subcommentary]
Not rigidly adhering to right and wrong, merely avoiding the affairs of the age.

Without relying on knowledge or deliberation, unaware of before or after,

[Annotation]
Unable to know right from wrong or before from after, he closed his eyes and indulged his nature, merely avoiding the troubles of the moment.

[Subcommentary]
Not following the heart’s inclinations, not employing knowledge or deliberation, nor looking ahead or behind—straightening his nature to accord with circumstances, he simply acted broadly, following things alone.

He remained towering and unmoved.

[Annotation]
Entrusting himself to his nature, standing alone.

[Subcommentary]
Towering and unmoved: a state of stillness. Though dwelling among the vulgar and mingling with the dust, he remained towering and independent.

Pushed, then he moved; pulled, then he went.

[Annotation]
This is what is meant by following what cannot be avoided.

[Subcommentary]
Pushed and pulled, following what cannot be avoided, responding only to stimulus, not initiating.

Like the whirling of a gust of wind, like the spinning of a feather, like the turning of a millstone—whole and without fault, in movement and stillness without transgression, never once incurring blame.

[Subcommentary]
Turning: grinding. Like the whirling of a gust of wind, the spinning of a falling feather, the turning of a millstone. These three are without intention, thus they remain whole and complete. Therefore, they are without right or wrong, without blame or transgression, without emotion, entrusting themselves to things—hence their steadfastness.

Is this not because—

[Subcommentary]
Posing a hypothetical question to reveal his capacity.

—things without knowledge have no trouble from establishing the self, no burden from employing knowledge, and in movement and stillness do not depart from principle, thus they live out their lives without praise.

[Annotation]
Trouble arises from praise, and praise arises from establishing.

[Subcommentary]
All things are mired in attachment to the self, establishing merit and fame, employing the heart’s knowledge and drowning in external realms. But the millstone and the like—acting or resting as things dictate, without intention, always abiding in the wondrous principle—cut off trouble and burden, thus fulfilling their Heaven-appointed destiny without blame or praise.

Hence it is said: to reach the state of things without knowledge is all; there is no use for worthies and sages.

[Annotation]
Only the sage can then discard knowledge and precedent, following Heaven’s principle. Thus, the foolish and the wise each occupy their proper place, the noble and the base each attain their rightful position, the worthy and the unworthy each follow their nature. To say there is no use for worthies and sages is not to know the Dao.

A clod of earth does not lose the Dao.

[Annotation]
It is joyful to discard knowledge like a clod of earth.

This is also said of ordinary things in general—none can attain the Dao, for the Dao does not pervade things.

[Subcommentary]
Esteeming the absence of knowledge, one’s nature becomes like tile and stone; rejecting worthies and sages, one is as benighted as one who wanders in darkness. Thus, like a clod of earth, one is said to attain principle. Such were the confusions of Shen Dao.

The eminent and powerful mocked him together, saying: The Dao of Shen Dao is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead.

The annotation states: To discard knowledge and follow one’s nature is to allow the spirit’s illumination to shine through—this is how one praises the sage. Yet to say that a clod of earth does not lose the Dao, that man should be like a clod of earth—how is this not death? This is why the eminent and powerful mocked him.

The subcommentary explains: The sage who attains the Dao illuminates all things without intent, their virtue harmonizing with the Two Modes and their clarity equaling the Three Luminaries. Yet to take a clod of earth as the Dao—how does this differ from death? Devoid of spiritual efficacy, it is not the conduct of the living. Thus, the learned and discerning, the profound and eminent, recognizing its deviation from principle, derided it as absurd.

The annotation adds: Failing to accord with the supreme Dao, it becomes strange and monstrous.

The subcommentary continues: Those who do not accord with the supreme Dao become precisely that—strange and monstrous. Tian Pian was likewise misguided, having studied under Peng Meng yet received no true teaching.

The annotation states: He attained the Dao of self-reliance.

The subcommentary explains: Tian Pian and Shen Dao, disciples of Peng Meng, indulged in unrestrained abandon, receiving no instruction. Peng Meng’s master said: The Daoist of old reached the point of neither affirming nor denying anything.

The annotation states: This is what is meant by "taking the equality of the ten thousand things as foremost."

The wind blew fiercely—how could one speak against it?

The annotation states: The sound stirred by the wind.

The subcommentary explains: *Huòrán* describes swiftness. The Daoist of old, emptying the heart and forgetting the self, took heaven and earth as their measure, no longer distinguishing right from wrong. Their influence, like the wind, passed swiftly—how could one cling to their sagely traces or fix them in words? They constantly opposed others, gathering no admiration,

The annotation states: Not conforming to popular expectations.

The subcommentary explains: Unable to fully align with the multitude, they often defied human sentiment, nor could they earn the veneration of the people.

yet were not exempt from the bluntness of the turtle’s cut.

The annotation states: Though they established laws, their edges were as dull as a turtle’s severed limb.

The subcommentary explains: *Yuánduàn* describes the lack of sharp edges. Though they enacted laws and spread transformation, they failed to fully equalize the ten thousand things, thus remaining subject to such bluntness.

What they called the Dao was not the Dao, and what they deemed correct was not free from error.

The annotation states: *Wěi* means "correct."

The subcommentary explains: *Wěi* means "correct." What Shen Dao called the Dao was not the true Dao, and what he claimed as correct was incorrect, hence not free from error.

Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not know the Dao.

The annotation states: The Dao is present in all things, yet to say that a clod of earth does not lose the Dao is to show ignorance.

The subcommentary explains: Though they practiced emptiness and forgetting, taking non-intention as the Dao, they failed to achieve perfect illumination—thus, they did not know it.

Nevertheless, in general, they had once heard of it.

The annotation states: They simply did not reach it.

The subcommentary explains: Though Peng Meng and his followers did not embody the truth, their aspirations were lofty. They possessed a rough outline, learning from one another, and had some basis—not mere arbitrary conjecture. Thus, they had once heard of it.

Taking the root as refined, the material as coarse,

The subcommentary explains: The root is non-being; the material is being. Employing non-being is subtle, the Dao refined; employing being is practical, the material coarse.

and accumulation as insufficient,

The annotation states: Entrusting it to the world, one finds abundance.

The subcommentary explains: Greed and hoarding leave the heart forever unsatisfied. Knowing contentment and stopping at one’s allotted share, one remains clear, pure, and empty, independent and self-sufficient in spirit. The Dao is omnipresent—such has been the case since antiquity.

Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of their teachings and delighted in them.

The subcommentary explains: His surname was Yin, given name Xi, courtesy name Gongdu. During the reign of King Ping of Zhou, he served as the magistrate of Hangu Pass, hence known as Guan Yin. His surname was Li, given name Er, courtesy name Boyang, with the alternate name Lao Dan—Laozi, the teacher of Yin Xi.

Master and disciple echoed one another, their principles in harmony. Thus, they rejoiced in the teachings of non-action.

They established it upon constant non-being and being,

The annotation states: What can non-being and being establish? Establishing them upon constant non-being and being clarifies that things establish themselves.

and took the Great Unity as their foundation.

The annotation states: From heaven and earth to the myriad things, each attains its own nature without adornment—is this not taking the Great Unity as their foundation?

The subcommentary explains: *Tai* denotes vastness; *yi* signifies oneness. The great Dao is boundless, encompassing all things, uniting them into one—hence the term *Taiyi*.

In establishing their teachings, they always took the constancy of non-being as their principle, awakening to its essence and taking the empty pervasiveness of the Great Unity as their foundation. This was their preference for frugality, which wearied their physical forms—it could not be taught to others, nor did it harm their Daoist arts.

They took gentleness, weakness, humility, and deference as their outward conduct, and emptiness and non-destruction of the ten thousand things as their substance.

The subcommentary explains: Outward conduct refers to external actions. They took softness, weakness, humility, and harmony as their external wisdom, and empty kindness and all-encompassing clarity as their internal virtue.

Guan Yin said: Within oneself, one holds nothing,

The annotation states: Things come, and one responds; responding without retention, thus merit follows things away.

The subcommentary explains: Not claiming merit, one attributes success to things—this is how one cultivates oneself.

while the forms of things manifest themselves.

The annotation states: Not asserting oneself but entrusting things, thus the forms of things each manifest clearly.

The subcommentary explains: Entrusting things without claiming merit, their natures and forms each manifest clearly.

Their movement is like water, their stillness like a mirror, their response like an echo.

The annotation states: They are constantly without emotion.

The subcommentary explains: Moving like flowing water, still like a hanging mirror, their response to stimuli swift as an echo—movement and stillness are without intent, their spiritual efficacy thus rapid.

Vague as if vanished, silent as if pure, those who harmonize with them find harmony, while those who grasp them lose.

The annotation states: Those who constantly preserve wholeness know not what they have gained.

The subcommentary explains: *Wù* means "faint," *wáng* means "nonexistent." The Dao is neither being nor nonbeing, neither pure nor turbid—thus it seems faintly vanished, yet its essence is not nonexistent; still and silent as if pure. Those who align with it, disregarding purity or turbidity, harmonize with the shallow perceptions of the common world. Yet if one takes this purity, emptiness, and nothingness as virtue, one loses the Dao.

It never precedes others but always follows them.

The subcommentary explains: Harmonizing without leading.

Lao Dan said: "Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine, and be a ravine for the world; know the white, yet guard the blackened, and be a valley for the world."

The annotation states: When things each guard their own place, they remain still and silent—what need is there for the masculine or the white? Are not the masculine and the white those who esteem victory and self-display? To esteem victory and self-display—is this not to pursue knowledge beyond one’s bounds and endanger one’s life? Thus the ancients did not follow boundless knowledge but guarded what was within their own bounds, and so their natures remained whole. When their natures were whole, only then could they extend to the world; when they could extend to the world, only then did all return to them as to a ravine or valley.

The subcommentary explains: Heroes and outstanding figures advance with restlessness and thus shorten their years; the feminine and the humble retreat in stillness and thus endure. Therefore, one abandons the glory of brilliance and self-display and embraces the humility of concealing one’s light—this is the pivotal mechanism of studying the Dao, and thus one becomes a ravine or valley for the world. Both ravines and valleys are watercourses, though ravines are small and valleys large, hence the repetition.

While others all seek to be first, I alone take the rear.

The annotation states: Not contending with the myriad things, one is then willingly elevated by the world without resentment, thus placing oneself behind.

The subcommentary explains: Common people all esteem victory and strive to be first, yet the great sage alone humbly remains behind, as the *Dao Jing* says: "Place oneself behind, and one finds oneself in front."

It is called bearing the world’s disgrace.

The annotation states: The feminine, the humiliated, the lowly—these are what the world calls disgrace.

The subcommentary explains: Retreating and placing oneself behind, one elevates others first—this is to bear disgrace.

While others all seek the substantial,

The annotation states: They know only being as useful, not knowing nonbeing as function.

The subcommentary explains: They covet material wealth.

I alone take the empty.

The annotation states: Guarding emptiness and tranquility to await the many substantial things.

The subcommentary explains: Guarding emptiness and stillness.

Having no hoarding, thus having surplus.

The annotation states: Entrusting things to guard themselves, one does not fear scarcity.

The subcommentary explains: *Cáng* means "to accumulate." Knowing contentment and guarding one’s bounds, one disperses without accumulating, thus having surplus.

Abiding in independence, thus having surplus.

The annotation states: This is what is meant by "standing alone and self-sufficient."

The subcommentary explains: *Kuīrán* means "independent." It speaks of purity and self-restraint, which are rare among things—only the sage remains without intent.

In conducting oneself, one moves slowly and without waste.

The annotation states: Acting according to what benefits the people, following the four seasons to bring things to completion, always in accord with the principle of the Dao, thus without haste or waste.

The subcommentary explains: *Fèi* means "loss." The one who has attained the Dao does not bestow petty favors; they eat from simple fields and stand in unborrowed gardens, at ease and unhurried, never harming themselves for the sake of things. This is how they conduct themselves and nurture their being.

Acting without contrivance, one laughs at craftiness.

The annotation states: Craftiness is contrivance, which harms the self-completion of the spiritual vessel. Thus the one who acts without contrivance follows things’ spontaneous arising and allows their spontaneous completion—each thing attains its own ability. Even a spider can spin its web, so every person has their own abilities; there is no need to value Gongshu.

The subcommentary explains: Moving in accord with one’s nature, simple and without contrivance, one scorns the cunning and falsity of common people.

While others all seek fortune, I alone bend to preserve wholeness.

The annotation states: Entrusting oneself to the ultimate principle, one remains constantly whole—thus one seeks no fortune, for fortune is already sufficient.

It is called merely avoiding blame.

The annotation states: Following things, thus things cannot blame one.

The subcommentary explains: *Jiù* means "misfortune." Common people, deluded and obstinate in their actions, know only to seek fortune and cannot consider misfortune. Only the great sage, with an empty mind, follows things with flexibility, preserving the way of life and thus avoiding calamity.

Taking profundity as the root,

The annotation states: The principle is rooted in the ultimate of the Great Beginning—it cannot be called shallow.

taking restraint as the guiding principle,

The annotation states: Avoiding excess and extravagance.

The subcommentary explains: Taking profound mystery as the root of virtue, taking frugality and restraint as the guiding principles of conduct.

It is said: What is rigid will break,

The annotation states: In perfect compliance, even metal and stone are not rigid; in opposition, even water and vapor cannot be altered. Perfect compliance preserves, opposition destroys—this is the correct principle.

what is sharp will be blunted.

The annotation states: Advancing restlessly without bounds is sharpness.

The subcommentary explains: Breaking the rigid conduct of strength, blunting the sharpness of greed—thus the *Dao Jing* says: "Blunt its sharpness."

Always being magnanimous toward things,

The annotation states: When each guards their own place, there is naturally room for all.

not diminishing others,

The annotation states: Preserving their nature.

The subcommentary explains: Retreating and being humble, thus magnanimous toward things; knowing contentment and guarding one’s bounds, thus not encroaching upon others.

this may be called the ultimate.

Guan Yin and Lao Dan—were they not the vast and true persons of antiquity?

The subcommentary explains: Guan Yin and Laozi, great sages of antiquity, plumbed the subtlest mysteries and merged with the true and the Dao. Their teachings were vast and boundless, their principles broad and profoundly mysterious. Zhuangzi was nearly their equal, hence this sigh.

Still and silent, without form; transforming without constancy,

The annotation states: Following things.

The subcommentary explains: The wondrous source is formless, thus still and silent; its traces follow things’ transformations, thus without constancy.

death and life together with it, heaven and earth in unison with it, the spirits and the bright in accord with it.

The annotation states: Following transformations.

The subcommentary explains: Taking death and life as day and night, thus uniting the two poles; turning with the workings of creation, thus journeying together with the spirits and the bright.

Vast and boundless—where does it go? Fleeting and swift—where does it proceed?

The annotation states: Without intention or direction.

The subcommentary explains: Entrusting itself to nature’s transformations, drifting with the boundless and the fleeting, roaming carefree; having no attachment to going or staying, it follows fate wherever it leads.

All things are encompassed, yet none can serve as its refuge.

The annotation states: Thus it remains wherever placed.

The subcommentary explains: Embracing the myriad things, enfolding the cosmos, never departing from the Dao—where could it return to its root?

Among the arts of the Dao in antiquity, there were those who dwelt in this. Zhuang Zhou heard of their teachings and delighted in them. With far-reaching discourse, vast and unbounded words, and speech without limits or boundaries, he gave free rein to his thoughts without constraint, never revealing his intent through partiality.

The annotation states: Not eager to make others perceive his meaning.

The subcommentary explains: *Miù* means empty; *yōu*, distant; *huāngtáng*, vast and boundless; *zìzòng*, unrestrained. *Jī* means uneven. Yet Zhuangzi, born to respond to the world, inwardly merged with the mysterious Dao. Thus he could expound teachings of emptiness, depth, and vastness, uttering words without end or thread, following the moment without bias, harmonizing his qi with the world, never standing apart.

He saw the world as sunk in turbidity, unfit for solemn speech.

The annotation states: Burdened by forms and names, they take solemn speech for madness and do not believe it—hence he did not engage them.

The subcommentary explains: *Zhuāngyǔ* means grand discourse. The common people of the world, mired in darkness and murk, all drown in petty distinctions—one cannot speak grand words to them.

He used *zhīyán* for ceaseless unfolding, *zhòngyán* for truth, and *yùyán* for breadth.

The subcommentary explains: *Zhīyán* is indeterminate; *mànyǎn*, without fixed intent. *Zhòng* refers to venerable elders. *Yù* means to lodge. A *zhī* vessel tips when full and rights itself when empty—thus it serves as a metaphor for perfect speech. The words of the aged, embodying much truth, and the principles lodged in others, profound and vast—such are the followers of Hong Meng, Yun Jiang, and Hai Ruo.

Alone he communed with the spirit of heaven and earth, yet did not look down upon the myriad things.

The annotation states: His words reached the ultimate principle, rightly ordering the nature and destiny of all things.

The subcommentary explains: *Áoniè* means arrogance. Embracing the wisdom of true essence and wielding the unfathomable spirit, he dwelt within the world, coming and going with birth and death. Humble and yielding to things, he was never arrogant.

He did not reproach right or wrong,

The annotation states: Having no right or wrong of his own, he let things follow their course.

to dwell among the common world.

The annotation states: Moving among things in form.

The subcommentary explains: *Qiǎn* means to blame. With no fixed right or wrong, it cannot be exhaustively reproached—thus he could ride the waves of the world and abide in the dust.

His writings, though magnificent and far-reaching, remained unharmed by contradiction.

The annotation states: Returning to harmony with things, thus unharmed.

The subcommentary explains: *Guīwěi* means grand and majestic; *liánfān*, harmonious and blended. Zhuangzi’s writings, though lofty and profound, still touched upon the common—thus they harmonized with things without harm.

His words, though uneven, were strange and wondrous to behold.

The annotation states: Not merely addressing the affairs of the time, hence uneven.

The subcommentary explains: *Cēncī* means now empty, now full—his words were not uniform. *Chùguǐ* means witty and playful. Though his parables and allusions spanned different eras, their humor and wit were most engaging.

His fullness could not be exhausted,

The annotation states: Abounding in all things.

The subcommentary explains: *Yǐ* means to cease. His writings, with their lucid words and far-reaching principles, embraced all things without limit—thus they could not be brought to an end.

Above, he roamed with the Creator, and below, he befriended those beyond death and life, without beginning or end.

The subcommentary explains: Riding transformations in carefree wandering, he befriended nature itself—thus he could merge life and death, darkening the distinction between beginning and end. From the subtle root to the coarse traces, his words descended to the lowest.

In regard to the root, his teachings were vast and expansive, profound and unrestrained; in regard to the source, they may be called fitting and ascending.

The subcommentary explains: *Pì* means to open; *hóng*, vast; *hóng*, also vast; *sì*, to extend; *suì*, to reach. Speaking of the ultimate root, his teachings were deep and vast, extending and opening without bound. The true source was attuned and ascended to the mysterious Dao.

Yet though he responded to transformations and untangled things,

The subcommentary explains: Though Zhuangzi’s writings were strange and wondrous, they responded to the changes of the moment and untangled the affairs of things—none surpassed them.

their principles were inexhaustible, their coming undiscarded.

The subcommentary explains: *Tuì* means to shed. The mysterious principles were empty and profound, responding without end; yet when the moment came to move him, he never shed or abandoned it.

Vast and obscure—who has fully grasped them?

The annotation states: Zhuangzi consistently spoke with a level mind, no different when speaking of himself than of others. Examining his words, they are vast and flowing—like Yu’s reverent reception of great counsel, what fault could lie here?

The subcommentary explains: *Mángmèi* means dark and deep. Zhuangzi’s writings were profound and distant, vast and obscure, beyond sight or hearing. If one seeks them through words and images, their depths remain unfathomed.

Hui Shi was versatile in many arts; his writings filled five carts. His Way was errant and mixed, his words often missing the mark.

The subcommentary explains: *Chuǎn* means divergent; *bó*, tangled. With many arts and five carts of writings, his principles were scattered and impure, his words eloquent but often off the mark.

In his reflections on things,

The subcommentary explains: His mind roamed the myriad things, examining and debating them.

he said: "That which is greatest and without outside is called the Great One..."

That which is smallest and without inside is called the Small One.

The subcommentary explains: Encompassing all without outside is called great; entering into the spaceless is called small. Though great and small bear different names, in principle they return to the undivided—hence they are called One. Without thickness, it cannot be accumulated, yet its vastness spans a thousand *li*.

The subcommentary explains: In principle, it is so subtle that it cannot be grasped; transcending form and color, how could it have thickness? Thus it cannot be accumulated or piled up. Not only does it not exist, it also does not not-exist—being and non-being give rise to one another, hence its vastness spans a thousand *li*. Heaven and earth are base; mountains and marshes are level.

The subcommentary explains: By common perception, heaven is high and earth is low, mountains tower and marshes lie below. Yet viewed through the Dao, mountains and marshes are equal in levelness, heaven and earth are one. The *Qi Wu* chapter says, "Nothing is greater than an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small"—this is its meaning. The sun is at once at its zenith and slanting; things are at once born and dying.

The subcommentary explains: *Nì* means slanted. Those in the west call it "zenith," while those in the east call it "slanting"—thus there is no true zenith or slant. It is like life and death: the living take death as death, while the dead take life as death. Since the sun’s zenith and slant are not distinct, so too are life and death without difference. That the great same differs from the small same is called the small same-and-different.

The subcommentary explains: Common perception distinguishes sameness and difference—this is the small same-and-different. That the myriad things are wholly the same and wholly different is called the great same-and-different.

The subcommentary explains: Life and death alternate, cold and heat succeed one another; forms and natures differ, yet in principle they are without distinction. The southern region is without limit yet has a limit.

The subcommentary explains: Knowing the four directions are without limit, one meets with things. Form does not exhaust form; color does not exhaust color—form and color exhaust one another. Knowledge does not exhaust knowledge; things do not exhaust things—exhaustion and things exhaust one another. Only because it is without thickness can it not be accumulated. Speaking only of the southern region is to illustrate one corner—from which the other three may be known. Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday.

The subcommentary explains: Gazing from the present to the past, one has the present; gazing from the past to the present, one has the past. Yet if the present is not truly present, how can there be a past? If the past is not truly past, how can there be a present? Since there is neither past nor present, it may be said that today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday. Linked rings can be unlinked.

The subcommentary explains: Rings interlock through their empty spaces, not through the rings themselves. Thus two rings pass through emptiness without penetrating one another, each turning freely—hence they can be unlinked. I know the center of the world: it is north of Yan and south of Yue.

The subcommentary explains: Yan and Yue are two states, far apart; common perception clings to directions, each claiming its own. Thus north of Yan and south of Yue may be called the world’s center. Embracing the myriad things with universal love, heaven and earth are one body.

The subcommentary explains: The myriad things and I are one—hence I embrace them with love. The Two Modes and I arise together—hence we are of one body. Hui Shi took this as the greatest principle, observing the world and enlightening debaters with it.

The subcommentary explains: Hui Shi used this principle, considering it supreme, and illuminated the world, instructing debaters with it. The world’s debaters delighted in it together.

The subcommentary explains: Sharing the same love and resonating in nature, the debaters of the world took joy in studying it. Eggs have feathers.

The subcommentary explains: Being and non-being are both names returning to emptiness. Common perception clings to appearances, saying eggs have no feathers—but since names are empty, they may be said to have feathers. A chicken has three feet.

The subcommentary explains: Numbers arise from emptiness and nothingness; from nothingness they proceed to being, and names are established. Thus two and three ultimately lack real substance—hence a chicken’s two feet may be called three. Since this is so for a chicken’s feet, it may be seen in all things. Ying possesses the world.

The subcommentary explains: Ying was the capital of Chu, seventy *li* north of Jiangling. All things have their place, each with its four directions—thus north of Yan and south of Yue may be called the world’s center. The state of Chu, with Ying as its capital, spanned a thousand *li*—why could it not be called the world? A dog can be called a sheep.

The subcommentary explains: Names have no power to grasp things; things have no reality corresponding to names. Names and realities are not fixed—hence a dog may be called a sheep. The people of Zheng call uncut jade *pú*; the people of Zhou call an uncured rat *pú*—thus form resides in things, while names reside in people. Horses lay eggs.

The subcommentary explains: Birth from wombs, eggs, or transformation—common perception distinguishes them, but viewed through the Dao, they are not different. Since a crow’s egg has feathers, why could a beast’s womb not be called an egg? A tadpole has a tail.

The subcommentary explains: The people of Chu call a toad a *dīngzǐ*. That toads have no tails is known to all—this is common perception, not the ultimate principle. Viewed through the Dao, nothing is without being, and since non-being may still be called "without," why could non-having not be called a tail? Fire is not hot.

The subcommentary explains: Fire is hot and water is cold—this arises from common perception. Viewed through principle, they are neither cold nor hot. Why? In the south there is a fire-eating beast, and sages enter water without getting wet. By this reasoning, they are fundamentally neither cold nor hot. It is like a staff striking the body, yet pain arises in the person—the person feels pain, but the staff does not. So too fire touches the body, yet heat arises in the person—the person feels heat, but fire does not. Mountains have mouths.

The subcommentary explains: Mountains originally have no names—mountain names come from the mouths of people.

In mountains it is thus, and the myriad phenomena are all the same.

The wheel does not tread upon the earth.
The subcommentary explains: When a chariot moves, its wheels turn without cease. The track ahead has already passed, and the path behind has yet to arrive—between past and future, there is no moment of treading. Thus, though the wheel rolls on, it never truly touches the ground. As the *Zhao Lun* says: "The whirling storm levels mountains yet remains still; rivers rush forth yet do not flow. The wild horse gallops yet does not move; the sun and moon traverse the heavens yet do not revolve." What is strange in this? What is strange in this?

The eye does not see.
The subcommentary explains: For the eye to see an object, it must depend on conditions. Since conditions are inherently empty, the eye cannot truly see.

The finger does not reach, yet reaching is unceasing.
The subcommentary explains: When a finger points to an object, it is not the finger itself—thus, the finger does not reach. Yet without the eye, the finger attains the object—thus, reaching is unceasing.

The tortoise is longer than the snake.
The subcommentary explains: In comparing length, there is no inherent long or short. To say the snake is long and the tortoise short is merely the stagnant perception of things. To dispel this delusion, it is said the tortoise is longer than the snake.

The carpenter’s square is not square, and the compass cannot make a circle.
The subcommentary explains: The compass draws circles and the square makes right angles—this has been so for ages. Yet names are not fixed, and square and circle have no true essence; thus, they cannot do so.

The mortise does not encircle the tenon.
The subcommentary explains: The mortise is the hollow; the tenon is the wood that fits into it. When the tenon enters the mortise, the wood passes through the empty space without obstruction—thus, it does not encircle. This is like the principle that interlocking rings can be separated.

The shadow of a flying bird has never moved.
The subcommentary explains: The past has already vanished, the future has yet to come—beyond past and future, there is no moment of flight. Only the bird and its shadow remain utterly still. Thus, all things in the world are fundamentally quiescent. As the *Zhao Lun* says: "The four images race like the wind, the celestial sphere turns like lightning—grasp the subtlest meaning, and though they shift, they do not change." This is what is meant by "things do not move."

The speeding arrow has a time when it neither moves nor stops.
The subcommentary explains: The *zú* is the tip of the arrow. Though its flight is swift, it does not escape the three times—no different from the wheel’s motion or the bird’s shadow. Since it neither treads nor moves, how can the arrow be said to stop or go? It is like a sharp blade cutting three strands of silk—within it, there are past, future, and present.

A dog is not a hound.
The subcommentary explains: Dog and hound are two names for one thing. Since names are empty, a dog is not a hound. Dog and hound share the same essence but differ in designation. When name and reality align, one calls it a dog, another a hound; when they diverge, one calls it a dog, distinct from a hound. As *Mozi* says: "A dog is a hound, yet a dog is not a hound."

A yellow horse and a black ox make three.
The subcommentary explains: Form is not color, and color is not form. Thus, one horse and one ox make two; add the horse’s color, and they become three. Say "yellow horse," "black ox," and "yellow-black"—form becomes three. It is like one and speech making two, and two with one making three.

A white dog is black.
The subcommentary explains: Names and designations are unreal; form and color are empty. To counter clinging perception, it is said the white is black.

A lone colt has never had a mother.

A one-foot staff, halved each day, will never be exhausted in ten thousand generations.
The subcommentary explains: *Chuí* is a staff; *qǔ* means to break. Someone asks: A one-foot staff, halved this morning, will leave five inches by evening. Within two days, the staff should be exhausted. This is plainly evident—how can it not be exhausted? The answer: Names correspond to reality, and reality to names. Thus, seeking things by name, they cannot be hidden. If one clings to the name "one-foot staff" and takes from it each time, how can there be an end? But if one breaks it at five inches, the name is violated—it is then called "half a foot," which is not the meaning of "one foot." The debaters align this with Hui Shi’s argument, remaining inexhaustible for a lifetime.

Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long, disciples of the debaters,
The subcommentary explains: Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long, both from Zhao, were masters of debate who lodged in the household of Lord Pingyuan. Gongsun Long wrote the *On Guarding Whiteness*, which circulates in the world. Using the above staff argument, they echoed and harmonized with one another, spending their years thus, never reaching an end.

They adorn the human mind and alter human intent,
The subcommentary explains: Indulging in such profound debates, they embellish the human mind and, with refined words, change human understanding.

Able to triumph over others’ mouths, but not to subdue their hearts—this is the debaters’ enclosure.
The subcommentary explains: Their arguments surpass things, so they can triumph over others’ mouths; their words do not accord with principle, so they cannot subdue others’ hearts. Thus, the debaters make this their preserve.
Another explanation: *Yòu* means "boundary." Hui Shi’s words do not align with principle; what they expound is confined to this limit.

Hui Shi said: With his knowledge and others’ debates, he alone created wonders with the world’s debaters—this was his foundation.
The subcommentary explains: *Tè* means "alone"; the character may also be written as *jiāng* ("to lead"). *Guài* means "strange"; *dǐ* means "essence." Hui Shi used discriminating knowledge to engage in debate, leading himself to stand apart from the world. Though his arguments were myriad, their essence did not surpass this.

Yet Hui Shi’s eloquence, he himself deemed most worthy,
The subcommentary explains: *Rán* means "thus." Hui Shi’s understanding of principle was second only to Zhuangzi, and his eloquence he considered superior to all. How could he be like those who merely debate?

Saying: "Heaven and earth are as vast as Zhuangzi!"

Hui Shi possessed grandeur in his five arts.
The subcommentary explains: *Zhuāng* means "great"; *wèi* means "the Dao/Way." He claimed that heaven and earth, born alongside me, were not great enough to be called so. His intent lay in heroic brilliance, surpassing the world and outshining others. Lacking humility and gentleness, he thus lacked the true Dao. Yet in speaking of his strength, he was uniquely mighty.

In the south there was an extraordinary man named Huang Liao, who asked why heaven and earth neither fell nor sank, and what caused wind, rain, and thunder.
The subcommentary explains: Dwelling in the south, surnamed Huang and named Liao, he did not conform to the common and stood apart from others, a wandering scholar beyond the mundane. Having heard of Hui Shi’s keen eloquence, he came to pose questions: how the two primal forces endured, and from what origins wind, rain, and thunder arose in their movements.

Hui Shi did not decline but responded, did not ponder but answered.
The subcommentary explains: With heroic spirit and unrestrained eloquence, he thus replied without refusal and answered without deliberation.

He expounded on the myriad things in all their aspects, speaking without cease, exhaustively and without end, yet still deemed it too little, adding the strange to augment it.
The subcommentary explains: He exhaustively expounded on the origins of the myriad things, explaining the causes of the two primal forces and thunder, never resting. Yet he still found it too brief, so he added the bizarre to display his talent.

Taking contrarian views as truth and desiring to surpass others in fame, he thus could not harmonize with the multitude.
The subcommentary explains: He took views contrary to human nature as the true Dao, always seeking to surpass all things and stand above the crowd, his heart set on reputation. Thus he could not find accord with the world.

Weak in virtue, strong in things, his path was obscure.
The subcommentary explains: *Tú* means "path." His virtue was exceedingly weak, yet his grasp of things was extreme. He claimed his path was profoundly secluded.

Viewed from the Dao of heaven and earth, Hui Shi’s abilities were like the toil of a single mosquito or midge—what use were they to things?
The subcommentary explains: *Yóu* means "from"; *yōng* means "use." From the Dao of the two primal forces’ generation and completion, Hui Shi’s power to transform things differed not from a mosquito or midge flying in the void, flapping its wings in clamor—merely exhausting itself. What could be said of it? His words on benefiting things were thus rendered useless.

To fill but one measure might yet be called daily more noble; how near he was to the Dao!
The subcommentary explains: *Jī* means "near." Hui Shi’s eloquence, though not vast in expounding principle, might yet fill one measure among the myriad things. Yet he sought to sharpen his passion for the noble Dao, adorning his intent to approach truth. Judged sincerely, this was truly not possible.

Hui Shi could not find peace in this, scattering himself among the myriad things without surfeit, and in the end gained fame for his eloquence.
The subcommentary explains: *Zú* means "end." He could not employ this profound Dao to bring himself peace, instead dissipating his spirit in lofty discourse on the myriad things. In the end, he had no Dao to preserve, gaining only the name of a debater.

Alas! Hui Shi’s talent overflowed yet found no outlet, chasing the myriad things without return—like pursuing an echo for its sound, or racing one’s shadow in a contest of speed. How lamentable!

Formerly, before I had perused the *Zhuangzi*, I once heard debaters contend over the meaning of "the foot-long staff" and "the linked rings," all claiming these were words of Master Zhuang, and thus classed Master Zhuang among the sophists. Examining this chapter’s critique of the various masters, however, when it reaches this passage, it states that his Dao is contradictory and discordant, his words miss the mark—thus I realized how hearsay on the roads harms truth. I too believed these were discourses without governance of the state or attainment of truth, mere useless talk.

Yet the sons of the rich and noble, like all who indulge in play, may grow weary of canonical words, yet still be able to distinguish names and analyze principles, thereby expressing their qi and ordering their thoughts. Flowing into later ages, if they keep their natures from depravity, is this not still more worthy than those who gamble and play chess? Thus I preserve these words without further judgment, leaving them to those who delight in such matters.

The subcommentary explains: *Dài* means "to let loose." How grievous that Hui Shi, though talented, lacked the Dao, letting his eloquence run wild without grasping the true source, racing after the ends of the myriad things and unable to return to the wondrous root. For in attaining principle, nothing surpasses forgetting knowledge; in returning to the source, nothing exceeds stilling debate. Yet Hui Shi toiled his mind and artifice in pursuit of the Dao, pouring forth his unadorned truth like a flooding river—how is this different from one who seeks to escape an echo by amplifying its sound, or flees a shadow by hastening his steps?
