**Heaven and Earth Chapter**
Heaven is exalted, Earth is lowly—thus Qian and Kun establish their positions.
The ruler is above, the minister below—thus noble and base form their ranks.
Heaven and Earth harmonize through non-intention; ruler and minister serve as limbs of one body.
Thus they mold the myriad kinds, bring well-being to the common people,
the Nine Provinces rest in peace, and the ten thousand regions rejoice in their labors.
The rustic elder knows not the Emperor’s power,
and the clappers of earthen tiles recognize not the age of Yao.
Transforming the degenerate customs of a dissolute age,
returning to the pure simplicity of high antiquity—
this is how one aligns with the intent of Heaven and Earth.

**Heavenly Dao Chapter**
"Heaven" is the name of the established essence;
"Dao" is the function of empty pervasiveness.
Without function, essence has no means to revolve and cover;
without essence, function has no means to generate and complete.
Essence and function depend on each other—
thus they serve as the origin of the myriad things.
The emperor-king, foremost among the myriad things, styles himself "the One."
Though the world calls him supreme in honor,
he must embody the Dao to put it into practice.
Yao and Shun, attaining the Dao, governed the four peoples,
never failing in years of abundance.
Jie and Zhou, losing the Dao, ruled over men,
and the myriad clans cried out to the Supreme Emperor of their innocence.
Where the Dao resides, the sage reveres it—
thus the Sovereign Xuanyuan crawled on his knees to follow the wind,
and Master Kong, having heard it at dawn, would die by dusk.
Such is the purport of the Heavenly Dao.

**Heavenly Motion Chapter**
"Heaven" is the designation of the natural;
"motion" is its ceaseless turning.
The form of Heaven revolves to the left,
while the sun and moon spiral to the right.
The sun’s motion is slow—one circuit of the heavens in a year;
the moon’s motion is swift—one circuit in a month.
The five planets traverse the heavens in alternating paths,
and the four seasons succeed one another to complete the year.
Who causes this to be so? It is simply so of itself.
The Great Lord receiving the Mandate is likewise:
the Gate of Heaven opens and closes without constancy,
metal and stone regenerate without cease.
One must know when to advance, when to retreat,
when to preserve, when to perish.
Yao and Shun abdicated and flourished anew;
Jie and Zhou overreached and their lineages were cut off.
As with emperors and kings, so too with human affairs—
this is the beginning of Heaven’s motion.

**Carving Intent Chapter**
"Carving" means to pare away; "intent" is the function of the heart-mind.
It speaks of one who sharply refines his intent,
exalts his conduct, seeks to stand out from the crowd,
and fixes his ambition on fame.
Some tread the sea and never return;
some embrace trees and wither to death.
Those who cultivate the Ru must reject the Mohists;
those who cultivate the Mohists also lack refinement.

**Discourse on the Sword Chapter**
The sword is forged from the iron of Gan and Yue,
wrought by the finest smiths of Ou.
Its scabbard disgorges blue lotuses,
its guard forms the crescent moon.
On land, it cleaves rhinoceros and elephant;
in water, it severs flood dragons.
When Jing Ke carried it into Qin, a white rainbow pierced the sun;
when Zhang Hua beheld it in Feng Prison, its aura shot toward the Dipper and Ox.
Though it could overawe the Three Armies,
it was but the valor of a single man.

The sword is no instrument for the noble man—
only in extremity is it wielded.
Now let the worthy minister serve as smith,
the good governor as forge,
the enlightened magistrate as charcoal,
the common people as copper.
Temper its edge with primal qi,
hone its blade with the whetstone of misty vapors.
Fashion its scabbard from benevolence and rightness,
its hilt from ritual and music.
Then great thieves lose their souls,
treacherous ministers forfeit their spirits.
All regions submit in transformation,
the four barbarians come to offer tribute.
Press it forth—none under heaven can withstand it.
Such is the essence of the Discourse on the Sword.

**Fisherman Chapter**
When King Ping moved east,
the House of Zhou declined and weakened,
rites and music, punitive expeditions—
all issued from the feudal lords.
Perverse doctrines ascended,
straight speech was exiled,
the noble dwelt in the wilds,
the petty filled the court.
The Fisherman withdrew in reclusion,
concealing his name to evade the world.
With a single skiff he plied the oars,
delighting in the Dao and rivers-and-lakes.
He sang the *Canglang* to mourn Qu Yuan,
brandished his staff to mock Confucius.
He wished to make emperors and kings
draw near the virtuous, distance slanderers,
seek the Way in mountain forests,
and search out recluses like Yang Zhu.
Then no old man would wash his ears by the riverbank,
no angler would cast his line at Pan Stream.
Naturally, the nine translations would come to court,
all regions submit in transformation.
Such is the essence of the Fisherman.
