**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken"**
The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
Nameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth;
Named, it is the mother of the myriad things.
Ever desireless, one observes its mystery;
Ever desiring, one observes its manifestations.
These two emerge together yet bear different names.
Together they are called the profound.
Profound and yet more profound—
The gateway to all mysteries.

"Eternal" denotes that which does not change.
Things may transform, but the Dao does not.
The transformations of things shift moment by moment,
Never pausing even for an instant.
Yet the Dao itself is without beginning or end;
Heaven and earth may perish, but this Dao is inexhaustible.
This is what is called "eternal."
As the eternal Dao, it cannot be attained through action,
Nor grasped through naming.
If it could be attained through action, it would not be the eternal Dao.
If it could be grasped through naming, it would not be the eternal name.
Before the inception of heaven and earth,
The principle of true constancy already resided in the nameless origin.
Thus, the nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.
Once heaven and earth were sundered, names arose,
And from these, the myriad things proliferated.
Thus, that which can be named is the mother of things.

The sage embodies the true and constant Dao,
Moving between being and non-being.
The "mystery" is the great Dao, the non-being;
The "manifestation" is the lesser Dao, the being.
When I wish to observe its mystery,
I enter into the mystery and return to non-being.
When I wish to observe its manifestation,
I emerge with the manifestation and wander in being.
Mystery is the subtlety of manifestation;
Manifestation is the subtlety of mystery.
Being is emptiness;
Emptiness is being.
Their root is the same, though their branches differ.
Thus, together they are called the profound.
Yet it is not only this—
The profound within the profound
Enables all manifestations to be nothing but mysteries.
This is the gateway to all mysteries,
For within the subtleties of being and non-being,
All is refined and transformed into mystery.

**Chapter Two: "When All Under Heaven Know"**
When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.
When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.
Thus, being and non-being produce each other;
Difficult and easy complete each other;
Long and short shape each other;
High and low incline toward each other;
Sound and voice harmonize with each other;
Front and back follow each other.
Therefore, the sage abides in non-action,
Practices the teaching without words,
Allows the myriad things to arise without hindrance,
Gives life without possessing,
Acts without relying,
Accomplishes without dwelling.
Only because he does not dwell
Does it not depart from him.

The five thousand words of *Laozi*
Above may penetrate the mystery,
Below may penetrate the manifestation.
Through them, one attains the Dao;
Through them, one governs the state;
Through them, one cultivates the self.
Their words consistently apply to these three,
Which is why they are subtle, mysterious, and profoundly unfathomable.

This chapter speaks of our original nature,
Which, before the existence of things,
Knew neither beauty nor ugliness, neither goodness nor not-goodness.
Once existence was established and forms and names were distinguished,
People knew beauty as beauty,
Yet did not realize that the name of ugliness arose from beauty.
People knew goodness as goodness,
Yet did not realize that the name of not-goodness arose from goodness.
For in all things under heaven,
Nothing exists without its opposite.
Being and non-being produce each other;
Difficult and easy complete each other;
Long and short shape each other;
High and low incline toward each other;
Sound and voice harmonize with each other;
Front and back follow each other—
Where there is one, there cannot fail to be the other.
The sage, knowing this,
Must stand before things and follow their natural course.
Engaging in non-action,
Practicing the teaching without words,
Neither grasping goodness nor rejecting ugliness,
Never clinging to one, yet never without unity,
Acting all day without acting,
Speaking all day without speaking—
Thus, when the myriad things arise, I arise with them.
Arising without hindrance,
When the myriad things live, I live with them.
Giving life without possessing,
For in acting, it is not my action but merely following things.
Thus, I act without reliance.
When there is accomplishment, it is not my accomplishment but merely responding to things.
Thus, I accomplish without dwelling.
By not dwelling in the end but dwelling in the beginning,
That which I dwell in cannot be taken away,
And so things cannot depart from it.

**Chapter Three: "Not Exalting the Worthy"**
Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending.
Not prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing.
Not displaying what is desirable prevents the heart from confusion.
Thus, in the sage’s governance,
He empties their hearts,
Fills their bellies,
Weakens their ambitions,
Strengthens their bones,
Ever keeping the people without knowledge and without desire.
He ensures that the knowledgeable dare not act.
Engaging in non-action, there is nothing left ungverned.

To be proud or boastful is to exalt the worthy.
To cherish or acquire is to prize rare goods.
To perceive or be drawn to beauty is to display what is desirable.
Speaking of the body alone:
The heart is the ruler; the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, limbs, and members are the people.
What the superior loves, the inferior will exaggerate.
If I set pride and boasting before the people,
The people will each boast of their abilities.
Boasting without end, their contention will inevitably arise.
If I set cherishing and acquiring before the people,
The people will each take what they desire.
Taking without cease, their thievery will inevitably arise.
If I make desire my heart,
Craving will know no bounds.
Whatever appears before me, whatever moves my eyes,
I will desire to obtain—
And thus, confusion will inevitably arise.

Thus the sage empties the heart, weakens the will, strengthens the bones, and fills the belly.
The heart and will belong to the human Dao;
the bones and belly belong to the Heavenly Dao.
The sage follows Heaven and not the human;
the multitude follows the human and not Heaven.
What is meant by "following Heaven and not the human"?
The heart is like the belly, the will like the bones.
As the saying goes: *"Would that the petty man’s belly were the noble man’s heart!"*—it would be nothing more than steadfast integrity.
For the belly is easily satisfied, while the heart is never satisfied.
The sage, abiding in Heaven, is full as the belly, firm as the bones—
none know how he is full, yet he is full;
none know how he is firm, yet he is firm.
Being both full and firm,
the heart is empty without striving for emptiness,
the will is weak without striving for weakness.
The multitude is not so:
they cling to the human and not to Heaven.
Thus, in contention and grasping, their hearts and wills grow strong within.
When the heart is wild, craving arises;
the more they take, the more they lack—
this is the belly never filled.
When the will is full, indolence follows;
indolence leads to insufficiency—
this is the bones never strengthened.
The sage, guarding within with clarity,
is unmoved by externals,
thus making the people without knowledge and without desire.
For where there is knowledge, there is inevitably mixture;
where there is thought, there is inevitably deviation—
this is inescapable for all things.
The sage knows that knowledge is not mixed, thought is not deviant.
I can know, yet knowing that knowledge cannot be master,
this is called *"the knower does not act."*
What is known is true,
what is done is not disordered.
Thus, knowledge is without knowledge,
action is without action.
Applying this to the state or to the self,
there is nothing that is not well-ordered.

**Chapter 4: The Dao’s Profundity**
The Dao is profound and ever-flowing,
its use never full.
Abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.
Blunting its sharpness,
untangling its knots,
softening its glare,
merging with the dust—
deep and serene, it seems to exist.
I know not whose child it is,
it seems prior to the Lord of Heaven.

The Dao is profoundly empty and wondrous;
pressed to grasp it, it seems unattainable.
Thus it is said: *"its use never full."*
Yet the deeper its mystery, the more it is used without exhaustion.
Each thing follows the Dao, yet the Dao never becomes a thing.
Thus it is said: *"it seems the ancestor of the myriad things."*

The ancients who studied the Dao
never set their minds on advancement or achievement.
To blunt its sharpness is not to act willfully—
they never feared what they did not do.
To untangle its knots is to act without omission—
they never sought goodness as beauty.
To soften its glare is not to seek goodness—
they never despised evil as wrong.
To merge with the dust is not to reject evil—
serene, they abided without abiding in serenity.
Thus it seems to exist.
I know not its beginning,
thus I know not whose child it is.
I know not what precedes it,
thus it seems prior to the Lord of Heaven.

**Chapter 5: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**
Heaven and Earth are not benevolent;
they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.
The sage is not benevolent;
he treats the people as straw dogs.
The space between Heaven and Earth—
is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
the more it moves, the more it yields.
Much speech leads to exhaustion;
better to guard the center.

Great benevolence is not partial,
though it may seem not to favor, its benevolence is all-pervading.
Small benevolence favors the near,
though it may seem to favor, its benevolence is not all-pervading.
Thus, Heaven and Earth do not favor each thing with partiality,
nor love each person as themselves.
Like straw dogs used in sacrifice,
they are neither used nor discarded,
neither valued nor despised—
they regard things as straw dogs,
and regard themselves as a bellows.

Empty yet inexhaustible,
the more it moves, the more it yields.
The bellows does not know it generates wind,
nor does the wind know it arises from the bellows—
thus the more it moves, the more inexhaustible it becomes.
If one insists on benevolence to favor things,
benevolence will not be all-pervading.
If one does not respond with emptiness,
the response will not be complete.
Now, to seek words with words
is already to risk exhaustion—
how much more to observe the myriad things with a single self?
Better to guard the center within,
speaking only when the time is right.
I know not what is said,
thus words fill the world without fault.

**Chapter 6: The Valley Spirit Never Dies**
The valley spirit never dies—
this is called the Mysterious Female.
The gate of the Mysterious Female
is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Subtle and enduring, it seems to exist;
its use is never exhausted.

The spirit is concealed in the body,
like a valley hidden in a mountain—
thus it is said: *"the valley spirit."*
The valley is empty, yet its function is fullness;
fullness arises from emptiness.
The valley spirit has no form,
dwelling in the formed yet never dying—
like its nourishment by the Mysterious Female.
The *Mysterious* is Heaven, in man it is the nose.
The *Female* is Earth, in man it is the mouth.
The nose, empty, receives Heaven’s *qi*;
the mouth, empty, consumes Earth’s essence.
Thus, the gate of the Mysterious Female
is the passage of essence and *qi*—
man’s immortality lies in his root in Heaven and Earth.
If one knows its regulation,
following its nature,
using non-use,
always keeping it subtle and enduring like the valley’s emptiness—
then the spirit moves and Heaven responds,
nothing fails to answer.

**Chapter 7: Heaven and Earth Are Everlasting**
Heaven and Earth are everlasting.
The reason Heaven and Earth endure so long
is that they do not live for themselves—
thus they can live long.
Therefore the sage places himself last and finds himself first,
sets himself aside and finds himself preserved.
Is it not because he is selfless?
Thus he can fulfill his self.

Heaven bestows, Earth produces—
the Dao of bestowing and producing lies in Heaven and Earth.
They never abandon the field for a day;
their bestowal is unceasing,
their production unfathomable.
Heaven never loves its bestowal,
Earth never rests its production—
this is called *"not living for themselves."*
Because they do not live for themselves,
the myriad things rely on them to live—
thus they can live long.
The sage is the same.
Knowing this heart is unchanging and indestructible,
vast and flowing with Heaven and Earth,
he finds nothing in this body to cling to.
The movement of this single heart
knows no action that is not done;
in every gesture, nothing is not good and beneficial—
like what he attains,
he takes non-self as self.
Thus, of all under Heaven who have a self, none compare to him.

This is called *"putting oneself last yet finding oneself first, setting oneself aside yet preserving oneself."*
What prevents people from perfecting things is their self-interest;
I have no self-interest, thus I can perfect others' interests.
When things attain their own interests,
I attain my attainment—
this is called *"mutual attainment."*

**Chapter Eight: Supreme Virtue is Like Water**
Supreme virtue is like water.
Water virtuously benefits the myriad things yet does not contend,
dwelling where the multitude abhors—
thus it nearly approaches the Dao.
In dwelling, it is good at low places;
in the heart, it is good at depth;
in giving, it is good at humaneness;
in speech, it is good at sincerity;
in governance, it is good at order;
in affairs, it is good at ability;
in movement, it is good at timing.
Only by not contending does it remain without blame.

Supreme virtue benefits things without choosing its place;
wherever there are things, I follow them—
thus its virtue is like water.
Above, it becomes rain and dew;
below, it becomes rivers and streams.
It does not choose the ground to dwell in,
nor choose things to bestow upon—
even in filth and defilement, nothing is not encompassed.
Dwelling where the multitude abhors,
thus it nearly approaches the Dao.

The sage’s benefiting of things is likewise.
In dwelling, he does not choose direction—
thus wherever he arrives is a good place.
The heart does not act for itself—
thus what it harbors is good depth.
In bestowal, he does not choose things—
thus what he gives is good humaneness.
The mouth does not choose words—
thus what it speaks is good sincerity.
Following principle in conduct,
there is no action that is not upright—
thus his uprightness is good order.
Without intent in affairs,
no affair is not accomplished—
thus his affairs are good ability.
Never acting arbitrarily,
every action accords with measure—
thus his movement is good timing.

For the multitude rushes toward what the sage abandons,
while what the sage possesses, the multitude lacks—
they never share the same path.
Thus I have never contended with others,
and others have no blame for me.

**Chapter Nine: Holding and Filling**
Holding and filling it is not as good as stopping.
Honing and sharpening it cannot be long preserved.
When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.
Wealth and honor with arrogance
bring one’s own calamity.
To retire when merit is achieved and fame is attained—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

Knowing its fullness yet holding it
is not as good as never having been full.
Knowing its sharpness yet honing it
is not as good as never having been sharp.
To know fullness yet hold it,
to know sharpness yet hone it—
this is already not good,
how much worse for those who are full yet do not hold,
sharp yet do not hone?
Fullness leading to greater greed,
sharpness leading to greater arrogance,
gold and jade filling the hall without knowing when to stop,
wealth and honor with arrogance—
unable to make things arrogant,
one first loses one’s own heart—
this is called *"bringing one’s own calamity."*

The movement of the four seasons:
when merit is achieved, one retreats—
the Dao of Heaven is like this,
how much more for humans?

**Chapter Ten: Carrying the Spiritual and Embracing the One**
In carrying the spiritual and embracing the One,
can you never part from it?
In concentrating qi to attain softness,
can you be like an infant?
In cleansing and purifying profound vision,
can you be without flaw?
In loving the people and governing the state,
can you practice non-action?
In the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate,
can you play the female?
In clarity and thorough understanding,
can you be without knowledge?

Giving life and nurturing,
giving life yet not possessing,
acting yet not relying,
growing yet not ruling—
this is called *"profound virtue."*

*"Carrying"* means beginning.
*"Spiritual"* means creating.
The *hun* is human yang.
The *po* is human yin.
From the beginning of creation, the *po* embraces the *hun*—
can you make the *hun* and *po* embrace,
united as one and never parting?

The infant’s yang qi is not yet dispersed,
inner harmony is soft—
this is not the infant’s ability,
but the effect of concentrating qi.
Without aiming to attain, it attains—
thus concentrating qi brings harmony,
united as one and without admixture—
can you be like a child?

In transcendent profound vision,
there is nothing not good,
yet if this heart is not forgotten,
it is insufficient to speak of the Dao—
thus can you cleanse and purify profound vision,
making it without flaw?

Loving the people with love,
love is never complete.
Governing the state with affairs,
the state is never well-governed.
In purity and stillness, facing the people,
the people will transform themselves—
thus can you practice non-action?

Yang moves and opens,
yin is still and closes—
one opening, one closing,
from which transformations emerge.
Yet ceaseless movement must reach exhaustion;
movement followed by closing,
guarding stillness to nurture movement—
thus can you play the female?

Inwardly and outwardly clear,
the center thoroughly illuminated—
though not engaging in affairs,
one is still burdened by the dust of stillness.
Only by knowing the self as no-self
can one know that nothing is an obstacle—
thus can you be without knowledge?

The sage gives life to things as a parent,
nurtures them as descendants—
yet gives life without taking as possession,
acts without relying on merit,
grows without claiming mastery—
without embodying profound virtue, this cannot be.

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**
Thirty spokes share one hub—
it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the cart lies.
Clay is molded to make a vessel—
it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the vessel lies.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room—
it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the room lies.
Thus, *"having"* is for the sake of benefit,
*"nothing"* is for the sake of use.

The body is *"having,"*
the spirit is *"nothing"*—
the spirit is concealed in the body,
using emptiness to employ fullness.
Thus the ear, without emptiness, cannot hear;
the eye, without emptiness, cannot see;
the nose, without emptiness, cannot smell;
the mouth, without emptiness, cannot receive;
the body, without emptiness, cannot touch.
Thus benefit may lie in fullness,
but use lies in emptiness.

Like thirty spokes forming a hub—
without emptiness, the hub cannot turn.
Clay molded to make a vessel—
without emptiness, the vessel cannot contain.
Doors and windows cut to make a room—
without emptiness, the room cannot be bright.
Ears, eyes, nose, and mouth gather to form the body—
yet without emptiness, the five senses cannot function;
without emptiness, the spirit cannot dwell.
The use of emptiness—
how great it is!

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**
The five colors blind the eyes,
the five tones deafen the ears,
the five flavors dull the mouth,
galloping and hunting madden the heart,
rare goods hinder conduct.
Thus the sage is for the belly, not for the eyes—
therefore he discards that and takes this.

The eye can see colors,
yet the eye is blinded by colors.
The ear can hear sounds,
yet the ear is deafened by sounds.
The mouth can taste flavors,
yet the mouth is ruined by flavors.
Galloping in the hunt, endlessly seeking goods—
all arise from the heart’s capacity to grasp,
yet this very capacity brings its own loss.

For the spirit dwells within,
while the ears, eyes, heart, and mouth divide its functions—
seeing, hearing, tasting, knowing.
If sight does not transcend color,
then color seizes sight.
If hearing does not transcend sound,
then sound seizes hearing.
If tasting stops at flavor,
then flavor seizes the mouth.
If the heart stops at grasping,
then grasping seizes the heart.

When these four are seized by things,
the eye is as if blind,
the ear as if deaf,
the mouth as if dulled,
the heart as if mad.
How much better to turn inward and seek,
so that seeing is not by color,
but seeing itself becomes the eye;
hearing is not by sound,
but hearing itself becomes the ear;
tasting is not by flavor,
but tasting itself becomes the mouth;
knowing is not by the heart,
but knowing itself becomes the heart.

Thus the sage is for the belly, not for the eyes—
the belly receives without grasping,
takes in without retaining,
easily satisfied and free of desire,
unlike the eyes, which are never sated,
ever seeing yet ever lacking.
The eyes roam outward,
the belly rests within.
The sage focuses on the inner and forgets the outer,
therefore discarding that and taking this.

**Chapter Thirteen: Favor and Disgrace**
Favor and disgrace are like alarm,
valuing great trouble as one’s own body.
What is meant by “favor and disgrace are like alarm”?
Disgrace is lowly—
gaining it brings alarm,
losing it brings alarm,
hence “favor and disgrace are like alarm.”
What is meant by “valuing great trouble as one’s own body”?
The reason I have great trouble
is that I have a body.
If I had no body,
what trouble would I have?

Therefore, one who values the world as one’s own body
may be entrusted with the world;
one who cherishes the world as one’s own body
may be relied upon with the world.

What is meant by “favor and disgrace are like alarm”?
The *Doctrine of the Mean* says:
“The noble person acts according to their station,
without desiring what lies beyond it.
In wealth and honor, they act as one in wealth and honor;
in poverty and lowliness, they act as one in poverty and lowliness.”
Thus the noble person finds contentment in every situation.
Favor and disgrace are not one’s true station—
gaining favor brings alarm,
fearing the disgrace to come;
losing disgrace brings alarm,
fearing the favor that may arrive.
Thus one fears favor as one fears disgrace,
gains favor as one gains disgrace.
Hence it is said, “Disgrace is lowly.”
For one knows both come from without.

What is meant by “valuing great trouble as one’s own body”?
*Mencius* says:
“A state without loyal ministers at home
or rival states abroad will perish.”
Yet trouble arises from having a body—
if I had no body,
what trouble would there be?
The body cannot be without thought,
for without thought, great trouble arises.
If one must have trouble, think how to avoid it—
then the body will not be lost.
Only by valuing great trouble as one values one’s body
can one avoid trouble.
Not only this—
therefore, one who values the world as one’s own body
may be entrusted with the world;
one who loves the world as one’s own body
may be relied upon with the world.
For only by treating the world’s troubles as one’s own
can one preserve the state.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**
Look and it cannot be seen—
this is called *yí*.
Listen and it cannot be heard—
this is called *xī*.
Grasp and it cannot be held—
this is called *wēi*.
These three cannot be further questioned,
so they merge into one.
Above, it is not bright;
below, it is not dark.
Endless, unnameable,
it returns to nothingness.
This is called the formless form,
the imageless image—
this is called the indistinct and vague.
Meet it and you cannot see its beginning;
follow it and you cannot see its end.
Hold to the ancient Dao to master the present,
and you may know the ancient beginning—
this is called the thread of the Dao.

Look and it cannot be seen—
it cannot be sought by color.
Listen and it cannot be heard—
it cannot be grasped by sound.
Grasp and it cannot be held—
it cannot be sought by form.
Since it is not confined by color, form, or shape,
what is called “original clarity”
is but a single pure brightness.
Before it scatters, it merges into one—
though it abides in brightness, it cannot be called bright.
Thus it is said, “Above, it is not bright.”
Though it cannot be called bright,
it also cannot be called dark.
Thus it is said, “Below, it is not dark.”
It has never been separate or apart,
hence “endless, unnameable.”
Though it returns to nothingness,
it cannot be called nothingness.
Thus it is called the formless form,
the imageless image—
this is called the indistinct and vague.
The indistinct and vague,
ever changing without fixed form,
is called the constant.
Its coming has no beginning,
so meeting it, you cannot see its head.
Its going has no end,
so following it, you cannot see its rear.
Hold to the ancient Dao to master the present,
and the present becomes like the ancient.
From the present’s likeness to the ancient,
you may know the ancient’s likeness to the present—
this is called the thread of the Dao.
The thread of the Dao means
no separation between past and present.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Skillful Practitioner**
The skillful practitioners of old
were subtle, mysterious, profound, and penetrating—
so deep they could not be known.
Because they could not be known,
I strain to describe them:
Cautious, as if crossing a winter stream;
alert, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;
solemn, as if a guest;
yielding, as if ice about to melt;
simple, as if uncarved wood;
open, as if a valley;
opaque, as if muddy.

Who can still the muddy and gradually clarify it?
Who can stir the still and gradually bring it to life?
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
Only because they are not full
can they remain hidden and not newly exposed.

The subtle, mysterious, profound, and penetrating practitioner
encounters things like one crossing a winter stream—
not hasty in action.
Like one wary of neighbors on all sides—
not hasty in knowledge.
Solemn as a guest—
not presuming to take the lead.
Yielding as ice about to melt—
not rigid in conduct.

Loose as ice melting—
not presuming to be solid.
Simple as uncarved wood—
not presuming to be refined.
Open as a valley—
not presuming to be full.
Opaque as muddy water—
not presuming to be clear.

People see it as turbid;
when stilled and observed, it gradually clarifies.
People see it as passive inaction;
when stirred and tested, it gradually comes to life.
Only the sage can nurture clarity within turbidity,
nurture movement within stillness—
thus ever clear, ever moving,
yet never full.
This speaks of attaining proper nurturance.
Only through proper nurturance
can the worn be made new,
the constant be made change.
If the new is taken as new,
its completion will not last a day before exhaustion.

**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Utmost Emptiness**
Attain the utmost emptiness,
maintain steadfast stillness.
The ten thousand things arise together,
and I observe their return.
Things flourish in abundance,
each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
stillness is called returning to life.
Returning to life is called constancy;
knowing constancy is called illumination.
Not knowing constancy—
reckless action brings misfortune.
Knowing constancy brings capacity;
capacity brings impartiality,
impartiality brings kingship,
kingship brings heaven,
heaven brings the Dao,
the Dao brings enduringness—
throughout life, no peril.

Emptiness is the Dao’s utmost;
stillness is the Dao’s beginning.
Thus, in stillness we speak of maintaining,
in emptiness we speak of attaining the utmost.
This means that those who study the Dao
steadfastly maintain stillness as their foundation,
attain the utmost emptiness as their completion.
When the ten thousand things arise together,
I do not act with them,
but calmly observe their return.
This "return" means
exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach life.
All people rely on the four great elements to form their bodies—
earth’s solidity, water’s moisture,
wind’s movement, fire’s warmth—
combining to become the self.
While they flourish in abundance,
they rush about with the four great elements,
changing with things,
unaware of their return.
When wind and fire depart,
earth and water gradually decay—
then where does this awareness reside?
Only then do they realize
that when external conditions scatter,
awareness returns to the self.
The mind is the root of the body.
Through deluded thoughts,
it nurtures guest-wisdom,
giving rise to dust and toil,
unable to still itself.
When deluded thoughts are removed,
guest-wisdom naturally ceases.
The mind’s essence is originally serene—
this is called returning to the root.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
stillness is called returning to life.
Life is one’s heaven.
Having recognized one’s heaven,
it is unchanging and unaltered.
Knowing its unchanging nature
is called constancy.
The reason people act recklessly
is that guest-wisdom flows and turns,
unaware that their own minds flow and turn without cease,
giving rise to calamity.
If, with the originally still, primal illumination,
one illuminates guest-wisdom,
not grasping its flow and turning,
and recognizes its constancy—
this is called illumination.
Internally embodying utmost constancy
is like empty space, not rejecting any phenomena.
Thus, it has capacity.
Things naturally find capacity,
neither rejecting nor grasping.
Thus, it is impartial;
impartiality is kingship,
kingship is heaven,
heaven is the Dao,
the Dao is enduring—
the more enduring, the more revered,
the greater, the more radiant.
Thus, throughout life, no peril.
From returning to the root to returning to life,
only those who maintain stillness can perceive it.
From capacity to enduringness,
only those who attain utmost emptiness can achieve it.
This is why this chapter speaks of it first.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Highest**
The highest—
those below merely know of its existence.
Next, they draw near and praise it.
Next, they fear it.
Next, they revile it.
Where trust is insufficient,
there is distrust.
Thus, the noble one values speech,
yet appears hesitant.
When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,
the hundred clans all say, "We are naturally so."

The highest virtue—
those below know of its existence,
yet cannot comprehend it.
Next, they draw near and praise it—
then they comprehend it.
When nearness and praise are insufficient,
they proceed to fear it.
When fear is insufficient,
they proceed to revile it.
Thus, not drawing near leads to fear,
not fearing leads to revilement—
this is the natural course.
That those below do not trust their superiors
is not necessarily their fault.
It arises from insufficient trust above,
causing doubt below—
no wonder in this.
The sage’s self-trust is steadfast,
yet they appear hesitant in speech.
When affairs are accomplished and deeds established,
the hundred clans cannot know how they achieved it—
even if they wished to deny its existence, they could not.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Decline of the Great Dao**
When the great Dao declines,
there is benevolence and righteousness.
When wisdom and cleverness emerge,
there is great falsity.
When the six relations are not harmonious,
there is filial piety and kindness.
When the state is in chaos,
there are loyal ministers.
When the Dao scatters, it descends and gives rise to wrongs;
when falsity prevails, it reverses and honors the Dao.
Descending is the Dao’s subtlety,
while reversal is the extremity of decline.
When the Dao has not yet scattered,
benevolence and righteousness lie hidden within it,
indistinguishable and uncountable.
When it becomes warmly benevolent,
people embrace its warmth as benevolence;
when it becomes rigidly righteous,
people embrace its rigidity as righteousness.
If the great Dao were practiced to govern all under heaven,
what need would there be for benevolence and righteousness to advance before it?
Unfortunately, there are those with petty wisdom and cleverness
who meticulously practice righteousness—
then falsity arises from this,
and disorder begins.
This is called descending and giving rise to wrongs.
In its later stages,
when human falsity abounds,
there is nothing that is not wrong.
Amidst the multitude of wrongs,
those who slightly differ from them
are then honored.
Thus, when the six relations are not harmonious,
only then do we know of kindness and filial piety;
when the state is in chaos,
only then do we know of loyal ministers—
this is called reversing and honoring the Dao.
When the Dao scatters, we see its semblance and forget its wholeness;
when it declines, it is utterly lost,
and we honor its semblance—
this is why it descends further and further.

**Chapter Nineteen: Abandoning Sagacity and Discarding Wisdom**
Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom—
the people benefit a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness—
the people return to filial piety and kindness.
Abandon skill, discard profit—
there are no thieves or robbers.
These three, as adornments, are insufficient.
Thus, let them have something to belong to:
manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
reduce self-interest, diminish desires.

The sage does not regard himself as sagacious, the wise does not regard himself as wise—if sagacity and wisdom could be abandoned, they would not be true sagacity or wisdom. The benevolent does not regard himself as benevolent, the righteous does not regard himself as righteous—if benevolence and righteousness could be abandoned, they would not be true benevolence or righteousness. Great skill does not display its skill, great profit does not display its profit—if skill and profit could be abandoned, they would not be true skill or profit.

The sage employs their substance, not their adornments; thus, what appears externally has no fixed form. The multitude steals their semblance, disrupting the true. Therefore, what appears externally must have something to belong to. That which has no fixed form benefits things, yet things do not perceive it; that which has something to belong to merely serves to disorder the world.

The sage detests falsehood for its power to disrupt the true, and so seeks to sever its root to remedy the ills of its branches. Thus, the people of the world no longer harbor minds of profit, stealing the conduct of sagacity and wisdom, feigning benevolence and righteousness while forsaking the substance of filial piety and kindness, or employing thievery while abandoning the convenience of skill and profit.

Only by placing plainness and simplicity before the people do they, seeing this plainness and simplicity, dare not deceive others with adornments. By not displaying private desires before the people, they, seeing this reduction of self-interest and desires, dare not deceive themselves with adornments.

*Commentary on the Dao and Its Virtue, Volume One, Concluded*
#1 "For and not *shi*": "shi" is likely a scribal error for "rely."
#2 "There is benevolence in me": "me" is likely a scribal error for "righteousness."

**Daoist Scripture, Part Two**
**Chapter Twenty: "Abandoning Learning Brings No Sorrow"**

Abandoning learning brings no sorrow.
Between "yes" and "ah," how great is the distance?
Between good and evil, what is the difference?
What others fear, one cannot but fear—
how vast and boundless it remains!

The multitude bustles and rejoices,
as if feasting at a grand sacrifice,
as if ascending a springtime terrace.
I alone remain unmoved, without sign,
like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.
Adrift, as if with no place to return.
The multitude all have more than enough,
I alone seem bereft.
What a fool’s heart I possess—so simple and pure!

The common folk shine bright,
I alone appear dim.
The common folk are sharp and discerning,
I alone am dull and obscure.
Vast as the sea, drifting without cease,
as if nowhere to rest.
The multitude all have their uses,
I alone am stubborn and coarse.
I alone differ from others,
yet I value feeding from the Mother.

If learning does not reach nothingness,
what is learned is not true learning.
The Dao takes non-attainment as attainment;
learning takes non-learning as learning.
If the Dao could be attained,
it would be mere benevolence and righteousness.
If learning could be learned,
it would be mere names and calculations.
Thus the sage takes non-attainment as attaining the Dao,
and non-learning as true learning.
Hence it is said: "Abandoning learning brings no sorrow."
If one has not yet reached non-learning,
then the world’s learning is endless—
grasping one thing, losing another,
gaining here, losing there,
one must rejoice in gain and sorrow in loss,
never at rest.

The root of the Dao,
viewed from its origin,
has never differed.
If one does not grasp the root but seeks to equal the branches,
the branches will surely diverge greatly.
"Yea" is reverent, "ah" is careless—
yet between "yea" and "ah,"
how great is the distance?
But when it becomes reverence or carelessness,
the distance grows vast.
Facing principle is good, turning from it is evil—
yet between facing and turning,
how great is the difference?
But when it becomes good or evil,
the distance grows vast.
The sage observes beginnings,
knowing their roots are the same,
thus turning carelessness into reverence,
evil into good,
in but a moment.
If one knows that "yea" and "ah," good and evil,
share the same root,
then attaining true learning is not difficult.
Yet when the sage emerges to respond to the world,
how can he easily change what the age desires
to follow his own desires,
or make the world’s views conform to his own?

What others delight in, I too delight in;
what others fear, I too fear.
But what sets me apart from the multitude
is that they indulge in boundless joy,
rejoicing as if ascending a spring terrace,
feasting as if at a grand sacrifice,
their brightness shining forth,
claiming none surpass them,
their wisdom sharp and clear,
claiming none exceed them.
Truly, they believe their joy is joy,
their beauty is beauty,
their brightness is brightness,
their wisdom is wisdom—
blind to their true nature, knowing only what is real.
Thus their minds see nothing beyond the self.

The sage’s mind wanders in the Dao,
and his response to things is not real.
Thus he remains unmoved, without sign,
like an infant who has not yet learned to smile,
adrift, as if with no place to return,
vast as the sea, drifting without cease.
The multitude all have more than enough,
I alone seem bereft.
The multitude all have their uses,
I alone am stubborn and coarse.
Is this truly the heart of a fool?
No—what sets me apart from the multitude
is that I recognize the root and reach the origin,
not flowing into the branches.
This is called "valuing feeding from the Mother."

**Chapter Twenty-One: "The Vast Virtue’s Appearance"**

The vast virtue’s appearance follows only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing is only vague and indistinct.
Indistinct, yet within it there are images.
Vague, yet within it there are things.
Dark and deep, yet within it there is essence.
Its essence is utterly real,
within it there is sincerity.
From ancient times to the present,
its name does not fade,
through which we observe the origins of all things.
How do I know the origins of all things?
By this.

"Vast" means great.
The greatest virtue’s appearance is also great.
The Dao has never had an appearance,
yet the vast virtue’s appearance depends on the Dao.
Thus it arises with the Dao’s arising—I know not its arising;
it ceases with the Dao’s ceasing—I know not its ceasing.
The Dao as a thing is vague, indistinct, dark, and deep,
yet within its vagueness there are images,
within its indistinctness there are things,
within its darkness and depth there is essence—
thus from nothing, nothing is not present.
What is present within presence,
the multitude take as real, not knowing that what is present has no true substance,
and that presence reverts to absence.
What is present within absence,
people do not know,
not realizing that absence reverts to presence.
For what is present within presence
is the coarse aspect of presence.
Only what is present within absence
is the true aspect of presence.
Only when it is true and not false
does it neither persist through presence
nor vanish through absence.
This is called "sincerity."
From ancient times to the present,
unchanging and unaltered,
its essence does not fade.
Thus the sage can observe the beginnings of all things
and know why all things are as they are,
for he embodies perfect nothingness,
and so can observe all things.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: "Bending Brings Wholeness"**

Bend and you will be whole,
twist and you will be straight,
hollow and you will be full,
worn and you will be renewed,
have little and you will gain,
have much and you will be confused.
Thus the sage embraces the One and becomes the world’s model.
Not seeing himself, he is enlightened;
not asserting himself, he is distinguished;
not boasting, he achieves merit;
not exalting himself, he endures.
It is only because he does not contend
that no one in the world can contend with him.
Is the saying "Bend and you will be whole" empty words?
Truly, wholeness returns to him.

Things cannot remain forever bent,
thus bending brings wholeness.
Things cannot remain forever twisted,
thus twisting brings straightness.
Hollow and they must be filled,
worn and they must be renewed,
having little makes gaining easy,
having much makes confusion easy—
this is the ultimate principle of fullness and emptiness.

The ancient sages were able to serve as the root of all things because they embraced the One.
To embrace the One is to always align with the Dao, thus they do not assert themselves, but follow others’ perceptions;
they do not insist on their own correctness, but follow the truth in things;
they do not claim credit for their achievements, but let others recognize them;
they do not boast of their virtues, but let others acknowledge them.
Only by standing alone without contention do they transcend all things,
and thus no one in the world can contend with them.

The sage follows the natural order in action—
water cannot fail to be whole,
yet it remains whole by yielding to curves.
Its wholeness is supreme.
This is called *truly* returning to wholeness.

**Chapter 23: *Hixian Ziran* (The Rare and Natural)**
Rare speech is natural.
A gusting wind does not last a morning,
a sudden rain does not last a day.
Who makes it so?
The heavens and the earth.
Even the heavens and the earth cannot endure long,
how much less can mortals?

Thus, those who follow the Dao:
those aligned with the Dao are one with the Dao,
those aligned with virtue are one with virtue,
those aligned with loss are one with loss.
Those aligned with the Dao find the Dao rejoices in them;
those aligned with virtue find virtue rejoices in them;
those aligned with loss find loss rejoices in them.
If trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.
Only when the time is right should one speak,
so that people do not perceive the speech.
This is called *rare speech, natural*.

If forced to speak, it is like gusting winds and sudden rains—
though it may prevail for a moment,
it will inevitably falter.
Even with the force of heaven and earth,
if they do not act according to their nature,
their fleeting, trembling motion cannot endure,
how much less can mortals?

Thus, those who follow the Dao never fixate on gain or loss.
Within them, it is naturally so—
they know that fundamentally, there is no gain or loss.
Without gain or loss, yet following the world’s gains and losses,
sometimes gaining, sometimes losing,
they trust in what arises,
and their hearts remain unburdened.
Thus, being one with the Dao is acceptable,
being one with virtue is acceptable,
being one with loss is acceptable.
Those one with the Dao rejoice in their Dao,
those one with virtue rejoice in their virtue,
those one with loss rejoice in their loss—
gain and loss alike, I do not know them.
This is why inner sincerity brings self-trust.
If trust is lacking, thoughts of gain and loss will swirl within,
with gains and losses alternating,
doubting oneself before others can trust you.

**Chapter 24: *Zhi Zhe Bu Li* (The Lame Do Not Stand)**
The crooked do not stand,
the straddling do not walk.
Those who assert themselves are not enlightened,
those who insist on their own correctness are not distinguished,
those who boast of their achievements have no merit,
those who exalt their virtues do not endure.
In the Dao, these are called *excessive food, superfluous actions*—
people may detest them,
so those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.

Stone stands without feet,
wind moves without feet—
this is because those who stand do not know they stand,
those who walk do not know they walk.
Feet not reaching the ground are called *lame*,
feet overstepping in walking are called *straddling*.
To stand lame is to stand briefly,
to walk straddling is to walk without endurance.

Ancient students of the Dao must be whole in heaven.
When they respond to things, they do not deliberate—
like the hands, feet, ears, and eyes responding instinctively to the heart,
without being commanded.
If hands, feet, ears, and eyes only act after thought,
then in every movement, one does not know what to do.

Thus, those who assert themselves are not enlightened,
those who insist on their own correctness are not distinguished,
those who boast of their achievements have no merit,
those who exalt their virtues do not endure—
this is because they have a self-centered mind.
To study the Dao while harboring a self-centered mind
is to indulge in *excessive food, superfluous actions*.

Food is for satisfying hunger.
Action is for serving purpose.
After hunger is sated, yet piles of meat and grain remain,
one fears not taking them away.
Actions that do not serve purpose—
even if one has Zhongzi’s frugality or Weisheng’s faithfulness,
they may still be burdensome.
Thus, *excessive food and superfluous actions*—
these two things people may detest.
Those who follow the Dao act according to their nature,
so their food is not excessive,
their actions are not superfluous.

**Chapter 25: *Youwu Huncheng* (The Indistinct and Complete)**
There is a thing indistinct and complete,
born before heaven and earth.
Silent and void,
it stands alone yet does not change,
circulates endlessly yet never perishes.
It can be the mother of all things under heaven.
I do not know its name—
I call it the Dao.
If I must name it, I call it *Great*.
Great is called *Passing*,
Passing is called *Distant*,
Distant is called *Returning*.
Thus, the Dao is great,
heaven is great,
earth is great,
and the king is great.
Within the realm, there are four greats,
and the king occupies one of them.

Humans model themselves after earth,
earth models itself after heaven,
heaven models itself after the Dao,
the Dao models itself after naturalness.

To call it *a thing* is beyond naming,
to call it *indistinct and complete* is beyond cultivation.
It was born before heaven and earth,
its beginning unseen.
Since its beginning is unseen,
its end is unknown.
Without beginning or end,
it stands alone yet does not change.
Though it stands alone, it never truly stands alone—
it circulates through all things,
entering everywhere without peril.
All things under heaven arise from it.
Endlessly generating, it can be the mother of all things.

Yet to call it *standing alone* is not standing alone,
to call it *circulating* is not circulating,
to call it *mother of all things* is not mothering all things.
I do not know its name—
I call it the Dao,
and if forced, I name it *Great*.
Though called *Great*, its greatness is unseen,
yet it transforms—thus it is called *Passing*.
Though called *Passing*, it never truly departs,
reaching everywhere—thus it is called *Distant*.
Though called *Distant*, in a single thought,
it possesses all things—thus it is called *Returning*.
Just as it is great yet able to pass,
distant yet able to return,
it is neither great nor small,
neither distant nor near—
all beyond naming.
This is called the Dao.

When the Dao descends and gives birth to things,
heaven and earth are divided,
and within the realm, the four greats exist.
From the perspective of the world,
the king’s greatness does not compare to heaven and earth’s greatness,
and heaven and earth’s greatness does not compare to the Dao’s greatness.

This is called the *Four Great*:
The king occupies one of them,
thus he is matched to the Dao—
as if there were no difficulty.

Though a single man’s body
may regulate the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure,
and yet still govern heaven and earth,
nurture all things—
how much more so for the king?

If he can turn to the *relative laws*,
man follows earth,
earth follows heaven,
heaven follows the Dao,
then the king’s matching to the Dao—
what difficulty could there be?

**Chapter Twenty-Six: *Heavy as the Root of Light***

*Heavy* is the root of *light*,
*stillness* is the sovereign of *restlessness*.

Thus the sage always says, *"I move,"*
yet never leaves his *baggage*—
his *heavy* foundation.

Though there are palaces of splendor,
he rests with detached ease—
how could a ruler of *ten thousand chariots*
lightly bear the weight of the world?

*Lightness* loses his ministers,
*restlessness* loses his sovereignty.
*Lightness* must return to *heavy*,
*restlessness* must return to *stillness*.

Thus, *heavy* is the root of *light*,
*stillness* is the sovereign of *restlessness*.
The sage always says, *"I move,"*
yet never leaves his *baggage*—
reaching everywhere,
yet never departing from his root.

Though there are palaces of splendor,
he rests with detached ease—
doing all things,
yet ever without doing.

How could a ruler of *ten thousand chariots*
fail to measure his own weight,
and yet only drive himself
through the world’s trivialities?
If he entangles himself in trifles,
then a single thing may enslave him—
how could he then rule the world?

Though both *lightness* and *restlessness* may bring illness,
*restlessness*’s harm is far greater than *lightness*.
For *lightness* enslaves the shallow heart,
while *restlessness* enslaves the deep heart.
The loss from *lightness* is only what he neglects,
but the loss from *restlessness* disturbs the sovereign within,
forfeiting the completeness of *stillness*.

Thus, *lightness* loses his ministers,
*restlessness* loses his sovereignty.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: *The Virtuous Walk Leaves No Trace***

The virtuous walk leaves no *tracks*,
the virtuous speech no *flaws*,
the virtuous plan no need for *calculations*,
the virtuous closure no *locks* yet cannot be opened,
the virtuous binding no *ropes* yet cannot be undone.

Thus the sage always excels in saving others,
and so never abandons anyone;
always excels in saving things,
and so never abandons anything.
This is called *inheriting clarity*.

The good man is the teacher of the ungood,
the ungood man is the foundation of the good.
If one does not honor his teacher,
does not cherish his foundation,
even with great wisdom, he remains in *delusion*.
This is called *the essential mystery*.

The walk has never been without *tracks*,
speech has never been without *flaws*,
planning has never been without *non-calculations*,
closure has never been without *non-locks*,
binding has never been without *non-ropes*.

Only those who attain the Dao
walk without leaving *tracks*,
speak without using the mouth,
plan without using the heart,
close without *locks* yet cannot be opened,
bind without *ropes* yet cannot be undone.
For their essence is *constant*,
and their skill lies in *employing constant*—
thus they excel in all things.

*Constant* is the Dao of all people,
of all things—
once called *constant*,
it neither increases with people,
nor decreases with things.

Though people and things all equally possess *constant*,
if they lose their *true constant*,
the sage always uses *true constant* to save them.
Using *true constant* to save people,
people abandon no one.
Using *true constant* to save things,
things abandon no one.
Yet how could the sage do this?
It is because people and things all possess this clarity.
The sage returns to them their *original clarity*,
thus it is said: *This is called inheriting clarity.*

As for *inheriting clarity*,
it is equalized in one.
Only man has neither goodness nor ungoodness,
thus the good man is the teacher of the ungood—
meaning the ungood can become good.
The ungood is the foundation of the good—
meaning the ungood’s nature is the same as the good’s.
If one does not honor his teacher
and does not learn from the good,
does not cherish his foundation
yet willingly becomes evil,
even with much wisdom, his roots are ever more in *delusion*.
Returning to the origin, restoring the root—
this is called *the essential mystery.*

---

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: *Knowing Its Heroic***

Know its *heroic*,
hold to its *receptive*—
and you become the *valley* of the world.

As the *valley* of the world,
your *constant virtue* never departs,
returning to the state of *infant simplicity*.

Know its *white*,
hold to its *black*—
and you become the *model* of the world.

As the *model* of the world,
your *constant virtue* never errs,
returning to the *boundless*.

Know its *glory*,
hold to its *humiliation*—
and you become the *valley* of the world.

As the *valley* of the world,
your *constant virtue* is complete,
returning to the *uncarved*.

The *uncarved* scatters and becomes *vessels*;
the sage employs them as *officials and leaders*.
Thus the great *framework* is not severed.

The *heroic* moves and acts,
the *receptive* remains still.
Movement must return to stillness,
the *heroic* must return to the *receptive*.
Thus it becomes the *valley* of the world.

The *white* desires knowledge,
the *black* desires non-knowledge—
knowledge is honored when non-knowledge is cherished,
and knowing *white* is wise when holding to *black*.
Thus it becomes the *model* of the world.

*Glory* is what I bestow upon others,
*humiliation* is what others bestow upon me—
if I bestow *glory* and others can accept it,
then my benefit lies in others.
If others bestow *humiliation* and I can accept it,
then my benefit lies in myself.
Thus it becomes the *valley* of the world.

Yet the Dao’s *constant*—
does it truly have what is called *heroic* and *receptive*,
*white* and *black*,
*glory* and *humiliation*?
Those who say *"know"* and *"hold"*—
these are not *constant virtue*.

When *constant virtue* scatters and becomes *virtue*,
and one governs oneself with *virtue*,
if one employs its *heroic*,
employs its *white*,
employs its *glory*,
then one loses *constant virtue*.

If one employs its *receptive*,
*constant virtue* never departs,
returning to *infant simplicity*.
If one employs its *black*,
*constant virtue* never errs,
returning to the *boundless*.
If one employs its *humiliation*,
*constant virtue* is complete,
returning to the *uncarved*.

The so-called *infant simplicity*,
*boundless*,
and *uncarved*—
all are *true constant*.

Thus *true constant* cannot be known,
cannot be held—
to make it knowable and holdable,
one must return it to *constant*,
and only then does it become the Dao.

When the *uncarved* scatters to become *vessels*,
the sage governs *vessels* with the Dao,
yet still does not lose the Dao,
thus he employs them as *officials and leaders*.
*Officials and leaders*—
to oversee the world as one oversees *officials and leaders*,
not as one governs a family in private.

「Thus, the sage governs without favoritism,
leads without domination—
this is the great principle of not overreaching.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Taking the World by the Dao**
If one seeks to take the world and act upon it,
I see that it is not inevitable.
The world is a sacred vessel,
unable to be forced.

Forcing it leads to its ruin,
grasping it causes its loss.
All things either move on their own or follow,
either exhale warmth or inhale cold,
either grow strong or wither weak,
either bear weight or collapse.
Thus the sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids arrogance.

The sage embodies the Dao as his nature,
yet only under necessity does he cherish form in the realm between heaven and earth.
Since the world cannot be governed without the sage,
he must take it under necessity.
But the sage regards this body as a lodging,
and the world as a lodging for his purpose—
a lodging would never force what it lacks,
lest it lose the true Dao of *constant virtue*.

Those who do not know the Dao regard the world as a concrete possession,
and when they assume lordship over it,
they wield it as a means to bend others,
to seize things,
yet they do not realize that their very actions
will instead lead to its ruin,
and their very grasping
will instead cause its loss.

Indeed, things in the world
either move on their own or must be followed,
either exhale warmth when breathed upon or inhale cold when blown,
either grow strong and robust or wither and decay,
either bear weight when entrusted or collapse when overburdened.
The non-uniformity of things is their natural condition.
If one insists on forcing them or seizing them,
making the self-moving follow,
the exhaling inhale cold,
the strong wither weak,
and the bearing collapse—
then even heaven would find it impossible,
how much more so humanity?

The sage follows their natural course,
knowing their inherent limitations.
Some things cannot be altered,
but he removes their excesses,
their extravagances,
their arrogances,
so that those which can move or exhale warmth,
can grow strong or bear weight,
do not overreach—
while those which must follow or inhale cold,
wither weak or collapse,
do not fall short.
This is called: *with my nature, I accord to theirs*.

**Chapter Thirty: Aiding the Ruler with the Dao**
To aid a ruler with the Dao,
one does not use force to subdue the world,
and one’s actions are naturally self-reverting.

Where the army encamps,
thorns and brambles grow.
After great battles,
there must be years of hardship.
The virtuous act decisively,
yet do not dare to force victory.

Decisive yet not boastful,
decisive yet not arrogant,
decisive yet not proud,
decisive only when unavoidable,
decisive yet not forcing—
this is the Dao.
Violating the Dao brings early ruin.

He who kills another’s father,
others will kill his father.
He who kills another’s elder brother,
others will kill his elder brother.
This is called *self-reverting*.

The harm of losing in war
is not easily measured by one or two.
Even if one wins by chance,
the killing energy’s repercussions
cannot be made to grow by earth,
cannot be made to harmonize by heaven.
Thus thorns and brambles grow where battles are waged,
and famine arises after military campaigns.
Hence, the harm of losing can be known.

Thus the virtuous warrior,
acting only when unavoidable,
achieves decisive victory in one battle,
yet does not use it to force further triumphs.
Decisive victory is fleeting.
Within, he holds the heart of *unavoidable necessity*,
without, he wages a single decisive battle—
thus he never boasts,
never grows proud,
never arrogates,
never forces.
All this stems from acting only when unavoidable.

If one acts when it is avoidable yet does not cease,
the army grows old and its energy decays—
like a man in his prime who must grow old,
this is violating the Dao.
Violating the Dao brings early death.
Even if a man does not violate the Dao,
he still dies before his time;
how much more so when the army truly grows old?

**Chapter Thirty-One: On Fine Arms**
Fine arms are an inauspicious instrument;
things naturally abhor them,
so those who follow the Dao do not wield them.

The gentleman values the left in dwelling,
values the right in wielding arms.
Arms are an inauspicious instrument,
not the instrument of the gentleman,
yet they are used only when unavoidable.
Calmness and simplicity are supreme,
victory without delight—
yet those who delight in victory
are those who delight in killing.

He who delights in killing
cannot achieve his desires in the world.
Auspicious matters favor the left,
inauspicious matters favor the right.
The Left General is stationed on the left,
the Right General on the right—
this is said with funeral rites in mind.

The multitude of those killed
should be mourned with sorrowful tears,
victory in battle should be treated with funeral rites.
Arms cannot be fine and yet fine,
just as a man cannot be killed and yet killed.
Thus, one who does not delight in killing
can then speak of arms.

Sunzi and Wuqi’s theories on arms
examine empty and full,
discern irregular and regular—
their words are meticulous.
Yet the roots of empty and full,
irregular and regular,
Sunzi and Wuqi may not have known.

The *Old Master* says: *Calmness and simplicity are supreme,
victory without delight.*
To speak of arms with calmness and simplicity,
truly seems unlike,
yet without calmness and simplicity there is no stillness—
stillness is the root of victory.
Without stillness, there is agitation—
agitation is the foundation of defeat.

When Liang Xiang asked Mencius:
*“How will the world ever be settled?”*
Mencius replied:
*“It is settled by one.”*
Liang Xiang asked:
*“Who can settle it by one?”*
Mencius replied:
*“He who does not delight in killing can settle it by one.”*
Pity that he lacked the wisdom to know this.

If one were truly not to delight in killing,
he could settle the world—
there would be nothing difficult.
From ancient times to now,
those who do not delight in killing must rise,
those who delight in killing must fall.
Those who delight in killing and yet temporarily succeed
have already perished;
there has never been one who delights in killing
and yet endures for many years.

Thus the gentleman,
when victorious in war,
treats it with funeral rites.
An inauspicious instrument,
those who follow the Dao do not wield it.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao is Always Nameless**
The Dao is always nameless.
Though crude, it is small,
yet the world dares not submit to it.
If lords and kings could preserve it,
all things would voluntarily come as guests.

Heaven and earth unite,
and sweet dew descends.
No one commands it,
yet it is evenly distributed.
When governance first began,
names were established.
Once names were established,
people knew them.
They knew them,
yet did not begin with them.

The Dao in the world
is like rivers and valleys in relation to the ocean.
»

「This chapter speaks of the Dao and instruments in a cyclical interplay of light and weight.
The Dao is always nameless—
though unseen, even the lowliest man may grasp it.
Crude though it be, small though it seem,
the world dares not treat it as a subject;
knowing its worth, none dare exceed it.
Though lords and kings are great,
if they cannot preserve it,
all things will not come as guests.
For it is this preservation that invites them,
not their own grandeur.

Compare it to heaven and earth setting their positions—
though high and low differ,
when perfectly united, sweet dew descends.
No one commands it,
yet all is evenly distributed.
Heaven and earth never cease to harmonize,
and thus the distribution is natural.
From this, we see:
The Dao though small, must not be slighted;
lords and kings though great, must not be revered;
heaven and earth though divided, are not estranged.
Though the Dao disperses into all things,
each thing has its name,
yet heaven never abandons them.
It is because heaven never abandons them
that all things stand between heaven and earth
without perishing—
for heaven is their source.
Thus, things do not diminish the Dao by dispersing,
nor does the Dao scatter by giving rise to things.
Compare it to rivers and valleys becoming clouds and rain,
or the ocean giving rise to moisture.
The qi of rivers and valleys
never ceases to flow into the ocean,
nor does the ocean’s qi
cease to return to the rivers and valleys.
If viewed through the Dao,
they are in constant cycle—
never a day without return.
But if grasped through instruments,
then land and water are divided,
and their paths differ.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing People is Wisdom**
Knowing others is wisdom,
knowing oneself is clarity.
Overcoming others is strength,
overcoming oneself is power.
Knowing contentment is wealth,
unyielding action is resolve.
Not losing one’s place is longevity,
dying without perishing is life.

Wisdom lies in outward perception,
clarity in inward reflection.
Strength lies in outward victory,
power in inward mastery.
Wisdom and strength are delusion,
clarity and power are true.
All who enter the Dao’s gate
must pass through this.

Yet people cannot enter the Dao
because they fail to see their own clarity,
and are overcome by things.
If one’s inner clarity is true,
then one does not chase the external.
Not chasing the external,
one gradually overcomes things.
With days deepened,
one naturally enters the Dao.

All who lack contentment
are unaware of their own sufficiency.
All things are already within me—
turning inward, I know:
Taking what is within myself is enough—
is this not wealth?
Contentment born,
I gradually depart from all desires.
Though strength is not yet complete,
I cannot fully manifest what I see,
so I must act with resolve.
Seeing the pure root,
I gradually return to the Dao.
Within emptiness, I verify the true attainment—
unbound by past or future,
vast and ever-present,
this is called not losing one’s place,
equally viewing life and death,
as morning and evening.
Living without attachment,
dying without loss—
this is called life.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Great Dao Flows**
The great Dao flows—
it can be turned to left or right.
All things depend on it for birth
yet it does not claim credit.
When its work is done,
it does not name itself.
It loves and nourishes all things
yet does not rule as king.
Ever without desire,
it is called small.
All things return to it,
yet it does not lord over them—
this is called great.
Thus the sage never claims to be great,
and so can achieve true greatness.

The great Dao flows—
filling all eight extremes,
yet when it acts,
it seems to be at hand.
All things are not born without the Dao,
yet the Dao never claims to have given them birth.
All things are not completed without the Dao,
yet the Dao never names its own achievements.
All things are not nourished without the Dao,
yet the Dao never considers itself their master.

When it is small,
its traces are not seen.
When it is great,
it does not lord over all things.
Yet all things return to it.
So too does the sage.
Never claiming greatness,
yet nothing surpasses them.
It is because they do not take greatness
that they achieve true greatness.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Grasping the Great Image**
Grasping the great image,
the world follows.
Following without harm,
one is at peace, tranquil, and serene.
Pleasure and bait,
and the Dao’s words—
when spoken, they are bland as tastelessness;
when seen, they are not visible;
when heard, they are not audible;
when used, they are inexhaustible.

The Dao descends and takes form—
form arises, and things follow it.
The foolish follow without return,
the wise follow without harm.
Those who follow without return
lose the Dao and follow things.
Those who follow without harm
go with the Dao.

If one goes with the Dao,
one never departs from it,
and is at ease everywhere,
tranquil everywhere,
serene everywhere.
Uniting with the Dao,
one’s heart does not know the Dao,
the Dao does not know one’s heart.
If one knows the Dao and acts accordingly,
then there will be no ease,
no tranquility,
no serenity.

The sage’s relation to form and instruments
is like a traveler’s stay in an inn—
temporarily dwelling, then departing,
never holding attachment.
If one is lured by pleasure and desire,
the traveler will stay at the inn,
lingering without leaving—
none will escape harm.
Thus the sage, though among forms and instruments,
grasps the great image and follows,
though they follow things,
their heart ever goes with the Dao.
Tasting the flavor of the flavorless,
seeing the color of the colorless,
hearing the sound of the soundless,
using the utility of the useless—
even within forms and instruments,
they fully gather the Dao’s use.
This is how they remain at peace, tranquil, and serene.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: When One is About to...**

**Chapter Thirty-Six: When One is About to...**

When one is about to *weaken* it, one must first *reinforce* it.
When one is about to *soften* it, one must first *strengthen* it.
When one is about to *abolish* it, one must first *promote* it.
When one is about to *take* it away, one must first *grant* it.

This is called *subtle clarity*—
softness and weakness overcoming hardness and strength.
A fish cannot be lifted from the depths,
nor should the state’s sharpest tools be displayed to the people.
This is the sage’s method of *restraining the heart and seizing the emotions*.

The heart, as a thing,
emerges and subsides without pause,
its origin unknown.
If one tries to stop movement with stillness,
stillness begets more movement—
the sage knows stillness cannot be forced.
Thus, when one seeks to *weaken*, they *reinforce*;
when one seeks to *soften*, they *strengthen*;
when one seeks to *abolish*, they *promote*;
when one seeks to *take away*, they *grant*.

To seek stillness through movement,
one must observe delusion in motion—
exhaust the movement, discard the delusion,
and the true will return to stillness.
Then, though one later seeks to move,
the heart will not stir.
Once the heart does not rise,
stillness will not be generated.

This is the sage’s way of *weakening the heart, subduing the will,
abolishing emotions, and seizing desires*—
subtle and hard to perceive,
hence called *subtle clarity*.
This *subtle clarity*, though gentle and weak,
can overcome all underheavens’ desires for hardness and strength—
for it never departs from the *Dao-mother*.
If it departs from the *Dao-mother*,
it is like a fish being lifted from the depths.
Since a fish cannot be lifted from the depths,
the state’s sharpest tools must never be shown to the people.
If one shows them, people will doubt their sincerity.
This is why the world’s scholars fail to follow its essence,
often mixing in Sun Wu’s military stratagems.
This is how the *Poetry* and *Rites* fall into ruin.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao is Ever Without Action**

The Dao is ever without action,
yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings can uphold it,
all things will transform of their own accord.
When transformation begins to take form,
I will restrain it with the *nameless undifferentiated* (朴).
The *nameless undifferentiated* will also not desire.
Without desire, all will be still—
the world will naturally align.
The Dao, though without form, enters into form,
beginning with the stirrings of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight,
and reaching completion in the fullness of ritual, music, punishments, and governance.
Once completed, if it does not return,
transformation becomes endless—
the more one strays from the Dao.
Thus the sage, when transformation is about to overflow,
restores it with the *nameless undifferentiated*.
The *nameless undifferentiated*, being nameless,
though used, appears as if without desire.
If one harbors a desire to use it,
then it is no longer the *nameless undifferentiated*.
Without desire, all will be still—
the people will naturally align.

*End of Volume Two of the Explication of the Daoist Classic on Virtue and the Way* #1
*"Not chasing externals, one gradually overcomes things"*:
*"chase"* (惊) is likely a miswriting for *"pursue"* (骛).

---
*Volume Three of the Explication of the Daoist Classic on Virtue and the Way*
*By the Daoist recluse, Xi Zhai*

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Supreme Virtue Does Not Virtue**

The supreme virtue does not virtue,
And thus has virtue.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue,
And thus has no virtue.

The supreme virtue acts without action yet nothing is left undone;
The lesser virtue acts and yet has much to do.

The supreme benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone;
The supreme righteousness acts and yet has much to do.

The supreme propriety acts and none respond,
So they roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.
Thus, when the Way is lost, virtue arises;
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, propriety arises.

For propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
And the beginning of chaos.
Prescience is the flourishing of the Way,
And the origin of folly.

Thus, the noble one abides in substance, not in thinness;
Abides in reality, not in flourishing.
Hence, they discard the latter and take the former.

The supreme virtue does not virtue,
Yet in benevolence, it is benevolent;
In righteousness, it is righteous.
It follows its course without clinging.

The lesser virtue does not lose virtue,
Yet benevolence cannot be made into righteousness,
And righteousness cannot be made into propriety.
Once done, it cannot be altered.

Thus, the supreme virtue does not lose the Way.
The Way is ever without action,
Yet the mind of non-action is within it.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue,
Yet virtue is with action,
And the traces of action appear.

The supreme virtue is non-action—this is benevolence.
Benevolence is near the Way,
Thus it is said: "Man is benevolence."
When combined, it is the Way.
Benevolence is near the Way,
Thus it is also without action,
And without anything to do.

Descending to righteousness,
Righteousness is what is fitting.
To act fittingly toward things,
There is something to do.
Yet acting does not lose what is fitting—
It is still not lost.

Descending further to propriety,
Propriety is order.
To order things with propriety,
If none respond yet I insist on ordering them,
Then there will be those who roll up their sleeves and force it.
This cannot be called the Way,
But it can be called virtue.
Virtue in man is benevolence;
Benevolence not losing what is fitting is righteousness;
Righteousness rectifying things is propriety.
Thus, when the Way is lost, virtue arises;
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, propriety arises—
This is the natural order.

From the Way descending five times,
Until it reaches propriety,
After five descents, it is no longer worth observing.

For propriety arises from chaos,
And because there are elders and juniors,
Without propriety, there is chaos,
Thus propriety is established to remedy it.
Yet when it comes to rolling up one’s sleeves and forcing it,
Then propriety is also lost.
Thus, propriety is the beginning of chaos.

Much knowledge is insufficient for the Way,
For its excess confuses the true origin.
Knowledge not from the true is empty and unreal.
Thus, much knowledge is the beginning of folly,
And propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
While prescience is the flourishing of the Way.

The sage abides in substance, not in thinness,
Values reality, not flourishing,
Thus they never lose the Way’s foundation.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Ancient Who Obtained the One**

The ancient who obtained the One:
The heavens obtained the One and became clear,
The earth obtained the One and became tranquil,
The spirit obtained the One and became numinous,
The valleys obtained the One and became full,
All things obtained the One and came to life,
The sovereigns and kings obtained the One and became the rectifiers of the world.
This is how the One was attained.

If the heavens did not obtain the One, they would fear to crack;
If the earth did not obtain the One, they would fear to erupt;
If the spirit did not obtain the One, they would fear to cease;
If the valleys did not obtain the One, they would fear to dry up;
If all things did not obtain the One, they would fear to perish;
If the sovereigns and kings did not obtain the One, they would fear to fall.

Thus, the noble is rooted in the lowly,
The high is founded on the lowly,
Hence the sovereigns and kings call themselves "lonely," "widowed," "not-grain"—
Is this not rooting in the lowly?
Is it not?

Thus, when the carts are many, the axle is unseen,
Not dazzling like jade, nor cold like stone.
Confucius said: "My Way is one and penetrates all."
What is this "one"?
The clarity of the heavens,
The tranquility of the earth,
The numinosity of the spirit,
The fullness of the valleys,
The life of all things,
The rectification of the sovereigns and kings.
Pushing to its utmost, they are all the same.

Knowing how the heavens are clear,
One knows how the earth is tranquil.
Knowing how the spirit is numinous,
One knows how the valleys are full.
Knowing how things come to life,
One knows how the sovereigns and kings rectify.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
"The world takes different paths yet arrives at the same destination;
A hundred thoughts converge in one harmony."
The world—what does it think, what does it ponder?
It speaks of never not being one.

If one does not know the One,
Then they must differ from themselves,
And differing, they sever from things.
If the sovereigns and kings sever from things,
Things will also sever from them.

Thus, the noble is rooted in the lowly,
The high is founded on the lowly,
The sovereigns and kings call themselves "lonely," "widowed," "not-grain"—
Is this not knowing that the noble is rooted in the lowly?

The spokes and hubs converge to form the cart,
Yet the cart cannot be named.
Ren, yi, li, zhi combine to form the Way,
Yet the Way cannot be named.
Rewards, punishments, and rectifications combine to form governance,
Yet governance cannot be named.

If there is something to grasp and employ,
Its traces appear externally—
The noble like jade, the lowly like stone—
All can be pointed to and named,
And thus people begin to distinguish noble and lowly.

---

**Chapter Forty: The Way’s Movement Is Return**

The Way’s movement is return;
Its use is weakness.

All things under heaven are born of being,
Being is born of non-being.
All things under heaven are born as being,
And only by returning to non-being #¹
Do they become the Way.
Thus it is said: The Way’s movement is return.

All things under heaven are born of non-being,
Yet being must be strong.
Returning strength to weakness,
One can gradually seek the Way.
Thus it is said: Weakness is the Way’s use.

Return is seeking non-being from being;
Weakness is attaining non-being to seek the Way.

---

**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Man Hears the Way**

The superior man hears the Way and diligently practices it.
The mediocre man hears the Way and holds it as if it exists, as if it does not.
The inferior man hears the Way and laughs at it.
If he does not laugh, it is not the Way.

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Way Produces Oneness**

The Way produces oneness,
Oneness produces twain,
Twain produces the triad,
The triad produces all things under heaven.

All things under heaven bear yin while embracing yang,
Their clashing qi harmonizes as unity.
What men detest are solitude, widowhood, and barrenness,
Yet kings and princes take them as titles.

Thus, some things are diminished yet grow,
Others are augmented yet decline.
What men teach, I also teach:
The strong and violent shall not meet their end—
I shall take them as my teachers.

When the Way produces oneness,
At that time, oneness has not yet arisen.
If oneness does not arise,
How could there be twain?
Without twain, oneness does not scatter,
Thus it is called *not-twain*—
Speaking of its state before oneness emerged.

When oneness arises, twain arises,
And when yang arises, yin arises.
With yin and yang together,
Their interaction forms the harmonizing qi—
Thus, twain produces the triad.
When the triad arises,
Then all things exist.

All things embrace the singular yang,
Bear the dual yin.
Yin and yang interact,
Their clashing qi harmonizes—
This is the triad.
Which thing under heaven lacks these three?

Yet tracing their origin,
They must return to the Way.
The Way is that which has not yet produced oneness.
Since their origin comes from the Way,
Their end does not stray from the Way.
Thus, things under heaven are sometimes diminished to grow,
Or augmented to decline.

Solitude, widowhood, and barrenness—
Yet kings and princes take them as titles—
This is diminishing to bring growth.
The violent and strong do not meet their end—
This is augmenting to bring decline.
Since diminishing and augmenting share the same source,
Self-diminishing must bring growth,
Self-augmenting must bring decline.

The Sage never augments,
Yet takes solitude, widowhood, and barrenness as titles—
To make men know that the violent shall not meet their end.
This is called: *What men teach, I also teach.*
It is but the Way’s response to the age—
How could it be otherwise?

---

**Chapter Forty-Three: The Supreme Softness**

The supreme softness under heaven
Overcomes the supreme hardness under heaven.
That which has no entrance into the unbroken,
I know this to be the benefit of *wuwei*.

The teaching of the unsaid,
The benefit of *wuwei*—
Few under heaven attain it.

Things are not truly things;
Hardness is a false form.
Even the supreme hardness of Heaven
Must ultimately return to non-being.
Now, the supreme softness
Already overcomes the supreme hardness—
How much more can it shatter the falsehood of being?

Thus, there is none who can enter the unbroken.
The unbroken—
To tread upon water and fire,
To enter metal and stone,
Without losing one’s essence—
This is what is meant.

The practice of *wuwei*
Is the Way’s action.
The teaching of the unsaid
Is the teaching of Heaven.

**Chapter 44: The Closeness of Name and Body**

What is closer: name or body?
What is more abundant: body or wealth?
Which brings greater harm: gain or loss?
Excessive love leads to great expenditure,
Excessive hoarding leads to great loss.
Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,
Knowing restraint brings no peril—
Thus one may endure long.

Name is not closer than the body,
Wealth is not more abundant than the body,
Gain does not compensate for loss.
Yet the world’s people always blame the name,
Drown in wealth,
And pursue gain—
Because they see nothing deeper.
I love things, and the more I love, the more I expend.
Things are stored within me, and the more there are, the more I labor.
Little love brings disgrace,
Great love brings danger—
And there are regrets one cannot overcome.

But the noble person is not so.
Knowing that all things are already complete within me,
I reflect inwardly and find contentment—
Thus I seek nothing externally.
Even if they wish to disgrace me,
They cannot.
Knowing where my stopping lies,
I halt at the Dao’s fullness—
Thus I act only in accord with the Dao.
Even if they wish to make me act,
They cannot.
This is how I remain constant,
And constant, I endure.

**Chapter 45: The Great Completeness as if Deficient**

The great completeness appears as if deficient—
Its use is unending.
The great fullness seems like emptiness—
Its use is inexhaustible.
The most upright seems bent,
The most skillful seems clumsy,
The most eloquent seems tongue-tied.
Agitation overcomes cold,
Quietude overcomes heat.
Purity and stillness are the rectitude of all under heaven.

Completeness and deficiency,
Fullness and emptiness,
Uprightness and bending,
Skill and clumsiness,
Eloquence and silence—
All are mere semblances of things.

Only the Dao is nameless.
To seek it by form,
One can never attain it.
Thus, though completeness seems like deficiency,
Though fullness seems like emptiness,
Though uprightness seems like bending,
Though skill seems like clumsiness,
Though eloquence seems like silence—
Its completeness is not in form,
Its fullness is not in vessels,
Its uprightness is not in strength,
Its skill is not in the mind,
Its eloquence is not in speech.
Therefore, the world seeks it by semblance and form,
Yet can never attain it.

The world’s talk of Dao and skill
Has never been without bias—
Like agitation overcoming cold,
Yet failing to overcome heat,
Or quietude overcoming heat,
Yet failing to overcome cold.
Each has its proper limit.
Only purity, stillness, and *wuwei*
Need not seek to overcome things,
Yet none under heaven can overcome it.
Thus it is said: purity and stillness are the rectitude of all under heaven.

**Chapter 46: Not Stepping Beyond the Door**

Not stepping beyond the door,
Yet knowing all under heaven.
Not peering through the window,
Yet seeing the Dao of Heaven.
The farther one goes,
The less one knows.
Thus the sage acts without moving,
Names without seeing,
Achieves without doing.

Those who venture forth to seek Heaven and Earth
Seek only their forms.
Heaven and Earth cannot be fully grasped by form,
Yet can be fully understood by principle—
Thus the farther one goes,
The less one knows.
If one knows that their principle lies within,
Then even closing the door suffices.

The sage knows the Dao is not in form,
Thus need not move;
Name is not in appearance,
Thus need not see;
Achievement is not in action,
Thus need not do.

**Chapter 47: When the World Follows the Dao**

When the world follows the Dao,
Warhorses are turned back to dung.
When the world does not follow the Dao,
Warhorses breed in the suburbs.

No crime is greater than desiring what should not be desired,
No calamity greater than failing to know contentment,
No fault greater than seeking what one has already obtained.

Thus, knowing contentment as contentment,
One is always content.
When the world follows the Dao,
It can make soldiers serve the people.
When the world does not follow the Dao,
It can make the people serve as soldiers.

When one knows the Dao,
It can make color appear as void.
When one does not know the Dao,
It can make void appear as color.

Desiring what should not be desired—
This is love.
Failing to know contentment—
This is taking.
Seeking what one has already obtained—
This is having.

From love arises taking,
From taking arises having,
And from having, endless faults proliferate.
If one knows that taking need not come from without,
This is called knowing contentment.
Knowing contentment,
One knows no lack.

**Chapter 48: Learning and the Dao**

Learning increases daily,
The Dao decreases daily.
Decrease it again and again,
Until one reaches *wuwei*—
Then there is nothing one cannot do.
To take the world by doing nothing,
Yet when one does something,
It is insufficient to take the world.

Learning is for seeking knowledge,
Thus it increases daily.
The Dao is for discarding illusion,
Thus it decreases daily.
If knowledge is not fully realized,
Then decrease is not complete—
Thus, learning daily
Is the means for daily decrease.

If one decreases again and again,
Illusion is discarded and truth is fully realized,
Then one attains *wuwei*.
When *wuwei* is fully reached,
Even if one takes the world,
One still does not see its use.
If one takes the world by doing something,
One cannot even obtain a single thing—
How much less can one take the world now?

The sage has no fixed heart.

**Chapter 49: The Sage’s Heart**

The sage’s heart is without fixity—
He takes the hearts of the people as his own.
The good, I treat as good,
The not-good, I also treat as good—
This is virtue’s goodness.
The trustworthy, I trust,
The untrustworthy, I also trust—
This is virtue’s trust.

The sage moves among the people,
His presence makes their hearts pure as water—
The people all strain their ears and eyes,
Yet the sage treats them as children.

Great indeed is the harm of the heart!
Zhuangzi says: No thief is greater than virtue’s heart,
And the heart’s eyes.

The heart, as a thing,
Penetrates Heaven, and Heaven is penetrated;
Penetrates Earth, and Earth is penetrated—
No distance it cannot reach.
Yet the world’s people take only distinctions for the heart.
When the heart of distinctions arises,
They falsely see what is not,
And lose their wholeness.
This is why Zhuangzi calls it a thief.

The sage’s heart
Is always with the Dao,
The Dao is everywhere—
Thus his heart is everywhere.
Hence, he has no fixed heart.
When it emerges to respond to the world,
He knows that all things follow illusion—
Thus the heart of taking and discarding never arises.

The good, I follow and treat as good,
The not-good, I also follow and treat as good—
Toward all under heaven, there is none I do not treat as good.
This is called virtue’s goodness.

「信亦吾从而信，不信亦吾从而信，於天下无不信，是谓**德信**。」

Trust, I follow and treat as trust,
The untrustworthy, I also follow and treat as trust—
Toward all under heaven, there is none I do not treat as trustworthy.
This is called **virtue’s trust**.

怵怵然常恐天下之人**德有心**而**心有眼**，
穿凿取与，不见大全。
故每为天下浑其心。

With solemn dread, I fear that people under heaven
Will **possess virtue with intent** and **have eyes in their hearts**,
Piercing and grasping, yet failing to perceive the whole.
Thus, I always strive to make their hearts **undivided**.

百姓用耳目所接者为明，
而不知其非明也。
圣人皆**孩**而**畜之**，
使不为非明所乱。

The common folk take what their ears and eyes perceive as clarity,
Yet they do not know that this is not true clarity.
The sage **nurtures all like an infant**,
So that they are not disturbed by false clarity.

然则非明者，
岂**释氏**所谓**无明**者欤？

Then, what is this false clarity?
Is it not what the **Buddhist School** calls **ignorance**?

出生入死章第五十
**出生入死**，生之徒十有三，
死之徒十有三。
人之生，**动**之死地十有三。

**Chapter 50: The Cycle of Birth and Death**
**Birth and death**—thirteen times as birth,
Thirteen times as death.
A man’s life is ever **moving** toward death’s domain thirteenfold.

夫何故？
以其生生之厚。
盖闻善摄生者，
陆行不遇兕虎，
入军不被甲兵。
兕无所投其角，
虎无所措其爪，
兵无所容其刃，
夫何故？
以其无死地。

Why so?
Because of the **excessive attachment to life**.
Yet those who master **life-nurturing** skill
Walk on land and meet no rhino or tiger,
Enter battle and are not struck by weapons.
The rhino finds no place to strike its horn,
The tiger finds no place to set its claws,
The weapons find no place to lodge their blades—
Why so?
Because they dwell beyond death’s reach.

性无生死，
出则为生，
入则为死。
有生则必有死，
有出则必有入，
物之所不能免也。
今以一人之身言之，
自少至壮，生之徒者也。
自壮至老，**动**而之死者也。
自老至死，死之徒者也。
若以十计之，
则生之徒十有三，
死之徒十有三，
**动**而之死者十有三。
人自壮以上皆趁於死，
是生之徒止有十三。
自**动**而之死以至死之徒，
合十有六。
凡如此者何也？
以其生生之厚也。
自爱其生，
而不爱物之生，
凡可取以厚其生者无不为也，
犹其生生愈后，
故其趁死愈速。

By nature, there is no birth or death—
Only when it **emerges**, it is called birth,
And when it **returns**, it is called death.
Where there is birth, there must be death,
Where there is emergence, there must be return—
This is what all things cannot escape.
Now speaking of a single man’s life,
From youth to vigor—this is the count of birth.
From vigor to age, he **moves** toward death.
From age to death—this is the count of death.
If we reckon by tens,
Then birth is thirteen,
Death is thirteen,
And **moving** toward death is thirteen.
From vigor onward, all men **rush toward death**—
Thus, the count of birth is only thirteen.
From **moving** toward death until death’s count,
Together they make sixteen.
Why all this?
Because of the **excessive attachment to life**.
He loves his own life,
Yet does not love the life of things—
All that can be taken to **thicken his life**, he does.
The more he **pursues life**, the more he **hastens death**,
Thus his rush toward death grows ever swifter.

善养生者则不然。
知生无生。
既知无生，
则死不可得。
死不可得，
则兕无所投其角，
虎无所措爪，
兵无所容刃。
虽有生亦不生，
既知不生，
则知所谓不死矣。

Yet those who **skillfully nourish life** are otherwise.
They know that **birth is without substance**.
Once they know this,
Then death cannot be attained.
Where death cannot be attained,
The rhino finds no place to strike its horn,
The tiger finds no place to set its claws,
The weapons find no place to lodge their blades.
Though there is life, it does not **cling**—
Once they know it does not cling,
Then they know what is meant by **not-death**.

道生之章第五十－
**道**生之，**德**畜之，
物形之，**势**成之。
是以万物莫不尊**道**而贵**德**。
**道**之尊，**德**之贵，
夫莫之命而常自然。
故**道**生之，**德**畜之，
长之育之，成之熟之，
养之覆之，
生而不有，为而不恃，
长而不宰，
是谓**玄德**。

**Chapter 50: The Dao Gives Birth**
The **Dao** gives birth to it,
**Virtue** nurtures it,
Things take shape from it,
And **momentum** brings it to completion.
Thus, all things do not fail to **revere the Dao** and **honor virtue**.
The **Dao’s reverence**, the **virtue’s honor**—
None command them, yet they always **operate naturally**.
Thus, the **Dao** gives birth to it,
**Virtue** nurtures it,
**Extends and cultivates** it,
**Matures and perfects** it,
**Nourishes and shelters** it—
Giving birth yet not possessing,
Creating yet not relying,
Extending yet not controlling—
This is called **mysterious virtue**.

物非**道**不生，
非**德**不畜，
自其有形，
以至於**势**长，
莫不以**道德**为主。
**道**之尊，**德**之贵，
至於此极矣。
然不自尊其尊，
不自贵其贵。
其施於物非有心於物也，
莫之命而常自然。
自然而生，
自然而畜，
凡所以长育成熟，
以至于养之覆之，
莫非自然者，
由其自然。
故未尝望物之报，
生不辞劳，
施不求报，
是谓**玄德**。

Things cannot be born without the **Dao**,
Cannot be nurtured without **virtue**,
From the moment they take form,
Until they grow in **momentum**,
They all rely on **Dao and virtue** as their foundation.
The **Dao’s reverence**, the **virtue’s honor**—
This reaches their utmost.
Yet they do not **self-revere their reverence**,
Nor **self-honor their honor**.
Their bestowal upon things is not done with **intent**—
None command them, yet they always **operate naturally**.
They **naturally give birth**,
They **naturally nurture**,
All that **extends, cultivates, matures, and perfects**,
Even to **nourishing and sheltering**—
None of these are done otherwise,
For they follow their **nature**.
Thus, they never **seek the things’ recompense**,
They **do not shun labor in birth**,
They **bestow without demanding return**—
This is called **mysterious virtue**.

天下有始章第五十二

是谓**袭常**。

**Chapter 52: Heaven and Earth Have a Beginning**
**Heaven and earth have a beginning**,
And this is the **origin of all things**.
Once you know its **origin**,
You also know its **manifestation**.
Once you know its **manifestation**,
You also **hold fast to its origin**,
And thus your life will not be **exhausted**.
**Close its apertures** and **shut its gates**,
And your strength will never **wan**.
**Open its apertures** and **pursue its ends**,
And your life will never **be preserved**.
To **perceive the minute** is called **clarity**,
To **hold fast to the soft** is called **strength**.
To **employ its radiance** and **return to its clarity**,
Is to **leave no calamity behind**—
This is called **following the constant**.

**Dao** as **origin**, things as **manifestation**.
The ancients who attained the **Dao**
Could make **origin and manifestation** never part,
And thus **Dao and things** became one.
Things **emerge from Dao**,
Things are not **other than Dao**,
Manifestation **comes from origin**,
Manifestation is not **other than origin**.
Things are not **other than Dao**,
Yet the world **discards things** to seek **Dao**,
Manifestation is not **other than origin**,
Yet the world **discards manifestation** to seek **origin**—
They are not **other**, yet they **self-separate**,
Thus they never **attain unity**.

If you make men know that **things are the Dao**,
That **manifestation is origin**,
And they **hold fast to this knowledge**,
Then they will **find their roots on every side**,
And there will be nothing difficult.

Those who do not **follow the Dao** but instead **use things** to **lose the Dao**,
Are like men who **open their apertures**.
**Apertures** are **breaches**—
To **pierce their breaches** and **pursue their desires**,
Their **mind becomes agitated** and their **vital essence weakens**,
Then **things perish** as they **grasp them**—
You must **close their apertures**,
**Shut their gates**,
So that their **spirit does not exit**,
And they **revolve back** to **nature’s origin**,
Thus **origin and manifestation** will not **part**,
And **Dao and things** will become one.

The ancients who reached **perfection**,
**Preserved their lives** and thus **lived**—
They employed this **Dao**.

Man’s **breath** lies in **not exhausting the minute**,
Nor **nourishing the trifling**.
If you **exhaust the minute** or **nourish the trifling**,
Though they be small, they must **be perceived as clarity**,
Though they be trifling, they must **be held as strength**.
Thus it is said:
To **perceive the minute** is called **clarity**,
To **know the soft** is called **strength**.
**Clarity** is the **root**,
**Radiance** is what **emerges from clarity**.
**Original clarity** is the **root**,
Its **branches** divide into **vision**, **hearing**, **awareness**, and **contact**—
All are its **radiance**.
The **Dao** flows from **root to branch**,
Learning **seeks the branch** to find the **root**—
Thus it is said:
To **employ its radiance** and **return to its clarity**,
Is called **following the constant**.
**Constant** is the **root**,
**Clarity and radiance** naturally **emanate from clarity**—
Now to **return radiance to clarity**,
Is called **following the constant**.

使我介然章第五十三
**使我介然有知**，
行於**大道**，
惟施是畏。

**Chapter 53: If I Were to Know**
**If I were to know** with **distinction**,
To **walk the Great Way**,
I would **fear only bestowal**.

**Chapter 54: The Well-Established Cannot Be Uprooted**

The **Great Way** is most **level**,
Yet the people **love shortcuts**.

The **court is well-ordered**,
Yet the **fields lie fallow**,
The **granaries stand empty**,
While they **adorn themselves with embroidery**,
**Gird themselves with sharp blades**,
**Indulge in food and drink**,
And **hoard wealth**—
This is called **thieving splendor**,
Not the **Way**.

The **Way** is not in **knowing**,
For **knowing** is **devious thought**.

The **true Way** must be **clear**,
Yet **clear** is not the same as **knowing**—
**Knowing** cannot **grasp** it.
Thus, **bestowal** is **exhaustless**,
**Use** is **unending**.
If I were to **walk the Great Way** with this **distinctive knowing**,
My **knowledge** would be **limited**,
Yet the **Way** is **boundless**—
**Trembling**, I fear my **bestowal** may be **insufficient**,
Hence it is said:
**"I fear only bestowal."**

Indeed, the **Great Way** is most **level**,
Yet the people **love shortcuts**.
Those who **love shortcuts** **know** that **knowing** is **theft**.

If one **walks in ignorance**,
Then **all** they see and hear is **the Way**—
How **vast** and **spacious** it is!
The **heart at ease**, **resting** each day.

Later generations are not so.
The **court is well-ordered**—
**"Ordered"** means **governed**.
When the **court is governed**,
Then **external adornments** arrive.
The **fields lie fallow**—
The **heart is ungoverned**.
The **granaries stand empty**—
**Conduct is unrefined**.
Yet they **don their fine silks** to **dazzle others**,
**Gird themselves with sharp blades** to **intimidate the masses**,
**Hoard food and wealth** without **using them**—
This is called **thieving arrogance**.
Thus, they **drift far from the Way**.

The **well-established cannot be uprooted**.

The well-established cannot be uprooted,
The well-embraced cannot slip away.
Their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.

When cultivated in the self, its virtue is **true**.
When cultivated in the family, its virtue overflows.
When cultivated in the village, its virtue endures.
When cultivated in the state, its virtue flourishes.
When cultivated in the world, its virtue is universal.

Thus, one observes the self through the self,
The family through the family,
The village through the village,
The state through the state,
The world through the world.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

Those who build achievements stop when their purpose is fulfilled.
Those who hoard wealth and profit perish when their gains scatter.
Yet those who ensure descendants’ sacrifices never cease
Are none other than those who establish the **Dao** and embrace **virtue**.

The Sage cultivates the **true Way** in the self,
Extends its overflow to govern the family,
And reaches the village, the state, and the world.

Yet the Sage observes the self through the self, but their intent is not confined to the self;
Observes the family through the family, but their intent is not confined to the family;
Observes the state through the state, but their intent is not confined to the state;
Observes the world through the world, but their intent is not confined to the world.

Each follows what is present,
And observes accordingly.

In the *Yijing*’s observation:
*"Washing without offering"*—
**Faith** shines like the sun.
The lower transforms through observation,
Washing without offering—
**Sincerity**, not things, is what matters.

Its effect reaches the lower transforming:
When the world is observed through the world,
The lower are transformed without haste yet swiftly.

---
**Chapter 55: The Depth of Contained Virtue**

The depth of contained virtue
Is like that of an infant.

Poisonous insects do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not seize,
Snatching crows do not clutch.

Bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm.
They do not know the union of male and female yet rise erect—
The utmost of **essence**.
They wail all day without exhaustion—
The utmost of **harmony**.

To know harmony is to know constancy,
To know constancy is to know clarity,
To increase life is to bring auspiciousness,
To let the **heart** command **qi** is strength.

When things grow strong, they age—
This is called **not-Dao**.
**Not-Dao** perishes early.

This passage speaks of poisonous insects not stinging,
Fierce beasts not seizing,
Snatching crows not clutching—
Its original text, from beginning to end, is all about the infant.

Yet the world doubts these three things harming the infant.
Zi You once said: *"The tiger fears those who do not fear it."*
Su Shi said: *"The world has never seen one who sees a tiger and is not afraid."*
Then how can this claim be proven true or false?

Again, it is said:
*A woman placed two children on the sand while washing clothes in water.
A tiger charged down from the mountain.
The two children played on the sand as usual.
The tiger butted them with its head, hoping to frighten them.
But the children, oblivious, did not react—
And the tiger finally left.*

Is this not what is meant by *"fierce beasts do not seize"*?

Yet when hands hold nothing yet are firm,
When the **yang** lacks desire yet acts,
When wailing continues all day without exhaustion—
Who makes this so?

It is because their **qi** is whole, their **essence** unified,
Their harmony is supreme—the utmost of **yang**.

If one nourishes their **qi** and attains harmony,
Ensuring harmony does not wane with strength but endures—
This is called **constancy**.

**Constancy** is the natural way of things,
Not something wrought by will.
To know **constancy** as **constancy** is **clarity**.
To know **clarity** as **constancy**, and clarity increasing—
This is called **auspiciousness**.
The **heart** commands **qi**, yet **qi** does not serve the **heart**—
This is **straight strength**.

All things, when strong, must age.
From strength onward, they lose the infant’s heart.
Mencius said:
*"The noble one does not lose the heart of the infant."*

To lose the infant’s heart is **not-Dao**.
**Not-Dao** perishes early.

**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak**

The wise do not speak,
Those who speak are not wise.
Block the **mouth**,
Close the **gate**,
Dull the sharp,
Untangle the tangled,
Blend their light,
Align with the dust—
This is called **mysterious unity**.

Thus, they cannot be approached or distanced,
Cannot be used for gain or harm,
Cannot be honored or degraded.
Therefore, they are the world’s most noble.

All that the world possesses
Is but a dream’s realm.
Thus, the wise do not speak,
For speech cannot exhaust knowledge.

The world’s ignorant cling to dreams as reality,
Chattering endlessly, never departing from dreams.
Thus, they do not know speech,
For their vision has not yet reached.

Block the **mouth**—
Be cautious in utterance.
Close the **gate**—
Keep people at a distance.

**Chapter 56 (continued): The Wise Do Not Speak**

Dulling the sharp—
This is to govern their inner nature.
Untangling the tangled—
This is to regulate their outer conduct.
Blending their light—
This is to suppress what resides within themselves.
Aligning with the dust—
This is to follow what exists in things.
Without exit or entrance,
Without inner or outer,
Without self or things—
This is called **mysterious unity**.

Having attained this unity,
They are called *approachable yet distant*,
*distant yet near*,
*useful yet without delight*,
*harmful yet without fear*,
*noble yet without arrogance*,
*lowly yet without humiliation*.
All things are insufficient to name them,
Thus, they are the world’s most noble.

**Chapter 57: The Way of Governance with Rectitude**

Govern with **rectitude**,
Employ **strangeness** in war,
Conquer the world through **non-action**—
How do I know this is so?

Because of this:
The world abounds with **taboos and prohibitions**,
Yet the people grow ever poorer.
The people possess many **sharp tools**,
Yet the state grows ever more **corrupt**.
Men excel in **crafts and cunning**,
Yet **strange things** proliferate.
Laws and decrees grow ever more **prominent**,
Yet **thieves and robbers** abound.
Thus, the Sage says:
*"I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves.
I love tranquility, yet the people become upright.
I do no work, yet the people grow rich.
I have no desires, yet the people remain simple.*

I govern with **rectitude** by relying on the people’s inherent uprightness.
I employ **strangeness** in war by relying on the inherent strangeness of arms.
I conquer the world through **non-action** by relying on the world’s inherent lack of strife.

All my responses to things—
Do they stem from me?
Or do they stem from things themselves?

The Sages of old could make the world as one body,
And China as one person,
Because their governance issued from **self-cultivation**.

If I abound in **taboos and prohibitions**,
Then restrictions and defenses must be established.
Once restrictions are established,
How can the people avoid becoming poor?

If I show the people **sharp tools**,
Then the people will vie for their use.
Once the people vie for **sharp tools**,
How can the state avoid **corruption**?

If I display **crafts and cunning**,
Then the people will excel in **technique and deceit**.
Once **technique and deceit** prevail,
How can **strange things** fail to proliferate?

If I rule the people with **laws and decrees**,
Then the people will also **steal laws** to benefit themselves.
When rulers and subjects **deceive each other**,
How can **thieves and robbers** fail to abound?

The Sage teaches **non-action**,
Teaches **tranquility**,
Teaches **non-strife**,
Teaches **non-desire**—
Then the people respond in kind to what is shown them.
Thus, it is said:
*"The people are like grass—
When the wind blows over them, they must bend."*

---

**Chapter 58: The Nature of Governance**

When governance is **obscure and subtle**,
Its people are **pure and sincere**.
When governance is **overbearing and scrutinizing**,
Its people are **deceitful and lacking**.

Calamity, ah! Fortune depends upon it,
Fortune, ah! Calamity lurks within it.
Who knows their ultimate end?
Let there be no **erroneous governance**!

What is **rectitude** becomes **strangeness**,
What is **good** becomes **deceit**.
The people’s confusion has endured for ages.

Thus, the Sage is **square yet not rigid**,
**Honest yet not harmful**,
**Straightforward yet not domineering**,
**Illuminating yet not blinding**.

When governance is **obscure and subtle**,
As though demanding nothing of the people,
Yet the people do not respond with **crafts and cunning** to their rulers—
Thus, their people are **pure and sincere**.

When governance is **overbearing and scrutinizing**,
As though gaining something for themselves,
Yet the people use **crafts and cunning** to evade—
Thus, their people are **deceitful and lacking**.

The world’s affairs,
Where calamity and fortune **interdependently arise**,
Have endured for ages.

When governance is **obscure and subtle**,
There is no gain for me,
Yet there is gain for the people.
When governance is **overbearing and scrutinizing**,
There is loss for the people,
Yet there is gain for me.
My gain means their loss,
My fortune means their calamity—
Thus, the **natural principle** operates.

The **ignorant** do not know the **rectitude of Dao/Way**,
And they insist on **overbearing scrutiny** as clarity,
Seeking **fortune through chance**,
Thus causing **rectitude** to transform into **strangeness**,
And **good fortune** to become **deceit**.

The people’s confusion has endured for ages—
Thus, the Sage is **square yet not rigid**,
**Straightforward yet not domineering**,
**Illuminating yet not blinding**.

In **rewards, punishments, laws, and governance**,
There are **rules**—
Yet if they are not applied to their fullest extent,
Then **strangeness** can revert to **rectitude**,
And **deceit** can change into **goodness**.

Thus, it is said:
*"When **teaching and transformation** are practiced,
They draw the **ordinary** into the realm of the **Noble**.
When **teaching and transformation** are abandoned,
They cast the **ordinary** into the path of the **petty**.
This must not be forgotten."*

The *Exegesis of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue* concludes here.

**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**

*"To govern people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.*
Frugality alone enables early cultivation.
Early cultivation is called the accumulation of profound virtue.
Profound virtue accumulated means nothing is unconquerable.
If nothing is unconquerable, its limits are unknown.
When its limits are unknown, one can possess a realm.
The mother of possessing a realm is what makes it endure.
This is the Dao of deep roots and firm foundation,
Of enduring life and long vision.
In governing externally, in serving Heaven internally—
None surpasses frugality.

Frugality means nothing is left unharmonized.
To be cautious within, to be tranquil without,
To let the inner mind not stray, the outer mind not rise—
This is called harmonization, and thus one can cultivate early.

To cultivate within the heart, to cultivate without the form,
To remain still and unmoving—
Then virtue begins to accumulate.
Accumulating in what is not accumulated,
Nothing can be unconquered.
If nothing is unconquered, nothing remains untamed.
Even with a realm, it is still attainable.

People know one can possess a realm,
But they do not know that those who can possess a realm
Are those who have their roots.
When roots are deeply planted,
Even dross and husks are refined into Yao and Shun—
What of those beneath them?

This is called deep roots and firm foundation,
The Dao of governing people and serving Heaven."

**Chapter 60: Governing a Great Realm**

*"To govern a great realm, treat it as you would a delicate fish.
To rule the world with the Dao,
Its spirits are not numinous.
Not that its spirits are not numinous—
They do not harm people.
Not that they do not harm people—
The Sage does not harm people.
Since neither harms the other,
Virtue returns in exchange.

Governing a realm is the Sage’s remaining task,
No different than cooking a delicate fish.
Though strange, cunning, and bizarre,
The Dao unifies all—
Thus, its spirits are not numinous.
Not that its spirits are not numinous—
If spirits were numinous,
All strange, cunning, and bizarre would transform into the Dao.
How could the Dao harm anyone?

The intent is to not harm people,
So even in the unseen—spirits and gods—
They cannot harm with their numinosity.
In governance and in the unseen,
Neither harms the other—
Thus, the hearts of people and spirits return in harmony.
Is this not the work of supreme virtue?"

---

**Chapter 61: Great Realms as the World’s Dependent**

*"Great realms are the world’s tributary.
The world’s tributary is like the female.
The female always overcomes the male by stillness,
By yielding as inferior.

Thus, when a great realm yields to a small realm,
It takes the small realm.
When a small realm yields to a great realm,
It takes the great realm.
Sometimes yielding to take,
Sometimes yielding while taking—
A great realm seeks only to nurture others,
A small realm seeks only to serve others.

Both gain what they desire,
So the great should properly yield.
If a great realm yields to obtain things,
Things will surely return to it.
The female, yielding in stillness, overcomes the male.
Thus, the female always overcomes the male.
If a great realm yields to a small realm, it will surely obtain the small realm.
If a small realm yields to a great realm, it will surely obtain the great realm.
Thus, the great realm sometimes yields to take the small,
The small realm sometimes yields to take the great.
Taking means each secures its own heart.

Therefore, a great realm seeks only to nurture small realms,
A small realm seeks only to serve great realms—
Only thus do both attain what they desire.

Mencius said:
‘To serve the great with the small is to fear Heaven.
To serve the small with the great is to delight in Heaven.
Those who delight in Heaven preserve the world,
Those who fear Heaven preserve their realm.
Thus, great realms should especially yield.’

---

**Chapter 62: The Dao as the Essence of All Things**

*"The Dao is the essence of all things.
The good person’s treasure,
The unvirtuous person’s refuge.
Fine words can be sold,
Noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.
Why would anyone abandon what is not good?
Thus, when establishing a Son of Heaven,
Appointing the Three Ministers—
Even with a jade tablet and four swift horses offered first,
It is not as good as presenting this Dao.

Why did the ancients value this Dao?
Not merely to gain rewards,
Nor to escape punishments.
Thus, it is prized by the world.

Essence means to hide.
The Dao is what all things treasure,
Like a hidden storehouse for things.
The virtuous take the Dao as their treasure,
Thus, they rejoice in their gains.
The unvirtuous have no refuge but the Dao,
Thus, they rejoice in escaping blame.
This is rooted in the natural heart of humanity,
Without artificial prompting.

Thus, if speech aligns with the Dao,
Its beauty can be sold.
If conduct aligns with the Dao,
Its nobility can be bestowed upon others.
If not rooted in the natural heart,
Speech will not be followed,
Conduct will not be emulated.

Since all are rooted in the Dao,
If by misfortune one falls into vice,
How could the Sage abandon them?
Thus, establishing a Son of Heaven,
Appointing the Three Ministers—
It is not for trivial gain of wealth and honor.
Rather, to prevent abandoning people in vice,
And to restore them with this virtuous Dao.

Even if one offers a jade tablet and four swift horses,
It is not as good as speaking a good word,
Performing a good deed,
So that no one in the world loses their virtue—
What benefit could be greater?

This is called presenting the Dao while seated.
Why did the ancients value this Dao?
Because the virtuous gain without delay.
If the unvirtuous, by misfortune, reach virtue,
They can still escape blame—
Is this not worthy of the world’s esteem?"

**Chapter 63: Doing Without Doing**

*"Do without doing,
Act without acting,
Taste without tasting.
Great or small, many or few—
Repay resentment with virtue.
Attempt the difficult in its ease,
Achieve the great in its smallness.

The world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease.
The world’s great tasks must begin in smallness.
Thus, the Sage never acts in grandness,
And so achieves the grand."*

**Chapter 63: Doing Without Doing (continued)**

*"He who lightly promises must often break faith,
He who seeks ease must often court difficulty.
Thus the Sage treats difficulty as difficulty,
And so never encounters difficulty.

Do without doing—then oneself does not labor.
Act without acting—then others are not troubled.
Taste without tasting—then things are not exhausted.
What the world calls ‘great or small, many or few’—
This is but a matter of form.

The Sage moves beyond form and instrument,
So great and small, many and few—
Are equal and made one.

If great and small, many and few,
Are already equal and unified,
How much more so the distinctions of favor and resentment,
Of repayment and bestowal?

What I do and what I bestow—
Is virtue alone.
How could I know of resentment,
How could I know of repayment?

Since there is no distinction between favor and resentment,
No difference between great and small, many and few,
Then in regard to the world’s affairs,
How could there be any intent to act?

Difficult tasks must be approached in ease,
Great tasks must begin in smallness.
From ease proceed, and even difficulty becomes easy.
From smallness act, and even greatness becomes small.

Thus the Sage never acts in grandness,
And so grandness must return to him—
Because he holds no intent.

It is only because the Sage holds no intent in action,
That he never seeks results before the deed is done.
How unlike the petty men of the world,
Who promise before they act,
And when the task arrives, seek ease!

To promise before acting brings few fulfilled words,
To seek ease in difficulty brings many failures.
The Sage, before the task arrives,
Ever treats it as though it were difficult.
Not that it is difficult,
But he does not assume it must be achieved by force,
And so treats it as difficult.

Only because he treats it as difficult,
Does he never encounter difficulty.

**Chapter 64: The Ease of Holding**

*"Its ease lies in its firmness,
Its firmness in its quietude.
Its frailty lies in its boldness,
Its subtlety in its dispersion.

Act before it exists,
Order before it is disordered.
A tree as thick as a man’s embrace
Grows from a tiny sprout.
A nine-tiered tower
Rises from a pile of earth.
A thousand-li journey
Begins beneath one’s feet.

The doer brings ruin,
The grasper loses hold.
Thus the Sage does not act—so he knows no ruin.
He does not grasp—so he knows no loss.

The people’s undertakings
Often fail when nearly complete.
To be cautious at the end and know the beginning—
Then there will be no ruined work.

Thus the Sage desires without desiring,
Does not prize hard-to-obtain goods.
He learns without learning,
Returns to the errors of the common folk.
To aid the natural unfolding of all things,
And not dare to act.

The Sage ever rests in what is at rest,
So his rest knows no disturbance,
And his holding knows no fixation—
Hence, it is called ‘easy to hold.’

By not holding, he holds his ease.
If even the slightest intention arises,
He plans against it before it shows,
Breaks it before it hardens,
Scatters it before it spreads—
And so none can disrupt his ease.

From holding ease before it exists,
From ordering the mind before it is disordered.
Like a tree as thick as a man’s embrace
Growing from a tiny sprout,
A nine-tiered tower rising from a pile of earth,
A thousand-li journey beginning beneath one’s feet—
In the midst of *non-doing*, it naturally comes to pass,
In the midst of *non-accumulation*, it naturally accumulates.

Day by day, burdens fade away,
Day by day, virtue grows—
Yet the Sage never knows of it.
If one acts with intent,
Then one brings ruin.
If one grasps with intent,
Then one loses hold.

Because he does not act, he knows no ruin.
Because he does not grasp, he knows no loss.
The world’s difficulty in attaining the Dao
And its ease in destroying it—
Arises from its intent to act and to grasp.

When its beginning, it seems to have no room for effort,
And when its end, it still cannot escape neglect.
All are the faults of acting and grasping.

If at its beginning one did not act,
If at its beginning one did not grasp,
Then one could not even find its effort—
How much less its neglect?

This is why the world’s undertakings
Often fail when nearly complete.

The Sage alone
Takes ‘not desiring’ as desiring,
Does not prize hard-to-obtain goods.
What is called ‘hard to obtain’—
Is not necessarily gold and jade.
Things outside the self,
All are hard to obtain.

The common folk’s eyes are bewildered by color,
Their ears by sound.
I take ‘not learning’ as learning,
Retreat the gaze and invert the hearing,
Return to the errors of the common folk,
To aid the Dao’s natural unfolding—
And dare not act.

Oh, how could there be any disease of acting and grasping?
The ancients’ skill in cultivating the Dao—

**Chapter 65: The Ancients’ Skill in Cultivating the Dao**"

The ancients who excelled in cultivating the Dao
Did not enlighten the people,
But rather sought to befuddle them.

The people are hard to govern
Because their cleverness is excessive.
To govern with cleverness—
Is the ruin of the state.
Not to govern with cleverness—
Is the blessing of the state.

To know these two is called the *lǐ* (pattern).
To be able to know the *lǐ*—
This is called *xuán dé* (mysterious virtue).

The mysterious virtue is profound and distant,
Opposed to things.
Only then does one reach great harmony.

What is called ‘seeing and hearing, awareness and knowledge’—
Does not lie in sounds and colors.

Yet the world’s eyes see not color,
Its ears hear not sound,
And is hindered by sounds and colors,
Unknowing that seeing and hearing,
Awareness and knowledge,
Extend beyond sounds and colors.

Now if I suddenly told people:
‘Your seeing and hearing, your awareness and knowledge—
All are not true!’
Then who would not be astonished and scornful?

Thus the Dao is not to enlighten the people,
But rather to befuddle and love them—
This is acceptable.

The people’s befuddlement
Is hindered by sounds and colors,
And they do not know how to free themselves.
I will show them *non-doing*,
I will show them *dànpō* (tranquil simplicity),
Yet they still do not awaken—
How much less could I enlighten them with cleverness?

The people’s affliction lies in their excess of cleverness.
If cleverness is not used rightly,
Then their cleverness becomes perverse.
Now I cannot awaken their perversity,
And yet I would enlighten them with cleverness—
This is to open their deceit anew.

Thus to govern with cleverness is ruin to the state.
If one follows what is without action,
And does not open the people’s scheming hearts,
Then scheming does not arise,
And purity and wholeness are complete—
This is called the blessing of the state.
Is this not acceptable?

The actions of the ruler above
Are emulated by the people below.
There has never been a case where I am tranquil and they are agitated,
Or where I am simple and the people are filled with desires.

To know the *lǐ* and to know the *lǐ*—
This is called *xuán dé* (mysterious virtue)."

「Mysterious virtue is profound and distant,
For its alignment is contrary to all things,
Thus it cannot be made clear to the people.
By its harmony with the Dao,
It is therefore called the Great Order.

**Why the Sea and Rivers Are Sovereign Over All Valleys (Chapter 66)**
The sea and rivers can be sovereign over all valleys
Because they excel in yielding to them,
Thus they can be sovereign over all valleys.
Therefore, the sage who wishes to lead the people
Does so by speaking from below.
Who would be first among the people
Does so by placing himself behind them.
Thus, though he stands above them, the people do not feel burdened,
Though he leads them, they are not harmed.
Hence, the world gladly follows and never tires.
Because he does not contend,
No one in the world can contend with him.

When the sage, of necessity, governs the world,
He views those who first emerge from the myriad things
And those who stand above the people
As matters of equal concern.
Thus, though he holds the world,
He leads the people by speaking from below,
And governs them by placing himself behind.
It is not the one who forgets the world
Who can do this.
Therefore, though he stands above the people, they do not feel burdened,
And though he leads them, they do not know he is their ruler.
Though he stands before the people, they are not harmed,
And though he leads them, they do not know he is their leader.
Only when both above and below forget each other,
Is it that the world gladly follows and never tires.
For the things I take are not what the people contend for.
The Way of *wuwei* (non-action),
The world does not even see its traces—
How much less would it dare contend with me?

**The World’s Praise of My Dao (Chapter 67)**
The world all says my Dao is vast,
Yet seems unlike the common.
Only because it is vast,
Does it seem unlike the common.
If it seemed like the common,
Long ago it would have been trifling.

I have three treasures, which I hold and preserve:
The first is *cí* (benevolence/mercy),
The second is *jiǎn* (frugality),
The third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (not daring to act before the world).

Benevolence makes one courageous,
Frugality makes one abundant,
Not daring to act before the world
Makes one a vessel of lasting worth.
Now if I abandon my benevolence and yet seek courage,
Abandon my frugality and yet seek abundance,
Abandon my humility and yet act before the world,
I shall perish.

Benevolence—
When wielding arms, it wins;
When defending, it holds firm.
Heaven, when about to save, uses benevolence to shield.
The common seek only outward form.
If one seeks the great through outward form,
Even reaching to the heavens and earth,
It is still where his pursuit ends.
The world all calls it great,
Yet it seems unlike the common.
Only because it is great,
Do all things prove insufficient to match its likeness.
If it had such likeness,
Then I too would be but one thing,
And my greatness would have long since faded.

Yet the means by which I achieve greatness
Still rely on these three treasures to hold and preserve:
The first is *cí* (benevolence/mercy),
The second is *jiǎn* (frugality),
The third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (not daring to act before the world).
These three are not the means to greatness,
Yet those who wield greatness
Cannot surpass them.

Greatness cannot be sought through outward form.
Greatness does not rely on outward form
Yet fully realizes its use,
Thus its greatness is beyond measure.
Only through benevolence
Can one save all things.
When things lose their place,
Even if they tread on water and fire,
Or rush toward blades—
They would not hesitate.
This is not the courage of a single man
That can match it.

Only through frugality
Can one truly give.
For the more meager my desires,
The broader my giving—
This is not the greatness without purpose
That can match it.

Only by not daring to act before the world
Can one meet things without strain.
For not acting first,
All that is done is merely in response.
Responding without leading,
Action does not originate from me.
Though I act, no one blames me—
This is not the stirring of strife or creation of affairs
That can match it.

Courage depends on benevolence,
Thus its vigor is unexhausted.
Abundance depends on frugality,
Thus its breadth knows no end.
Leading depends on following,
Thus its firstness is unstoppable.
If one relies only on courage,
Only on abundance,
Only on acting first,
Then by the end of the day he shall die.

Now, arms—
They are the most ominous of instruments.
If not rooted in benevolence,
To save the people from water and fire,
To make them know that all who kill are not benevolent,
I have not seen their worth.
I use benevolence to save the people,
And Heaven too shall use benevolence to shield them.

**The Art of Governance (Chapter 68)**
The skilled in governance are not martial,
The skilled in war do not rage,
The skilled in defeating enemies do not contend,
The skilled in using people place them below.

This is called the virtue of non-contention,
This is called the power of using people,
This is called aligning with Heaven—
The ultimate of the ancients.
The sage does not even possess a self,
How much less would he contend.
Because he does not contend,
All that he responds to
Is what he cannot help but do.

Thus, when he is a scholar, he is not martial,
When he wages war, he does not rage,
When he defeats enemies, he does not need to contend with them,
When he uses people, he does not need to place himself above them.
Therefore, he can serve the people with virtue,
And the people will gladly die for him—
This is called aligning with Heaven,
The ultimate of the ancients.

**The Use of Arms (Chapter 69)**
The use of arms has its words:
I do not dare to be the host while being the guest,
I do not dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot.

This is called *xíng wú xíng* (action without action),
*rǎng wú bì* (repelling without arms),
*chéng wú dí* (withstanding without enemies),
*zhí wú bīng* (seizing without arms).

No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy,
For underestimating the enemy
Nearly forfeits my treasures.
Thus, when armies clash and add to each other’s woes,
The one who laments will win.

Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about warfare.
Confucius replied:
*The matter of offerings and sacrifices,
I have heard of them.
But military affairs,
I have not studied them.*
As for his own words:
*I fight and conquer,
I sacrifice and receive blessings.*

Mencius also said:
*If the present-day rulers of states
Were to practice the kingly Dao,
Then the people of neighboring states
Would look up to them as to parents.
Yet they would lead their sons and brothers
To attack their own parents—
Since the birth of the people,
There has never been one who could succeed in this.*

The words of Confucius and Mencius are no more than this.
Laozi said:
*I do not dare to be the host while being the guest,
I do not dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot.*
He also said:
*Arms are the most ominous of instruments;
He who delights in killing cannot fulfill his ambitions in the world.*

Following this reasoning,
It is also what Confucius meant—
I have not heard Mencius speak of the kingly Dao.*

When forced to wage war, it is as though one walks without feet, seizes without arms, fights without weapons, and grasps without hands. This is what Confucius meant by *"I fight and conquer,"* and what Mencius meant by *"There has never been one who could succeed in this."*

The Sage’s use of arms is always a last resort. How could there be a heart to seek victory through reckless daring? If I were to dare lightly and yet act upon it, then war would originate from me. Should I fail, the people would not justify their ruler. Thus, when arms are used, one must resist with endurance, persist with patience, and not exploit the people violently—then victory is certain.

My words are easy to know, easy to practice.
Yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them.

Words have their root; actions have their master.
Only because of ignorance does the world fail to know me.
Few know me, and thus I am honored.
Therefore, the Sage wears coarse cloth while cherishing jade.

The Great Dao is easy to know, easy to practice—
Yet also difficult to know, difficult to practice.
What is called "easy to know" is:
No Dao to speak of, no learning to pursue,
No action to take, no affairs to attend—
How could it not be easy to know, easy to practice?

Yet the Ultimate Way cannot be spoken of—
For words are all false.
Learning cannot be learned—
For the moment the mind moves, it is already false.
"Doing without doing"—
Yet the one who remains still may not truly be so.
"Acting without acting"—
Yet the one who busies himself all day may not truly be idle.
This is why it is difficult—
And why none in the world can know or practice it.

The Sage’s words have their root; his actions have their master.
Thus, what is spoken here may have its meaning elsewhere;
What is done may seem right, yet the heart differs.
To know the root of words is to see their differences clearly;
To know the master of actions is to judge their differences without doubt.

Only because people are ignorant do they fail to know me.
Only because they do not know me am I honored.
If my knowledge were no different from theirs,
Then my worth would not be distinguished.

**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**
To know the unknown is supreme;
To not know the known is sickness.
Only by recognizing sickness as sickness
Does one avoid it.
The Sage does not fall ill
Because he recognizes sickness as sickness—
Thus he does not fall ill.
The wise chase after things,
So they accumulate falsehood.
The ignorant return to the root,
So they approach truth.
If one can recognize that not knowing is near truth,
And that knowing is full of falsehood,
Then he is supreme.

If one does not recognize knowing as falsehood
But instead only increases his knowledge,
Then he uses sickness as medicine—
And his sickness is beyond measure.
Only by recognizing knowing as sickness
Does one avoid it.
This is how the Sage does not fall ill—
Because he knows it.

**Chapter 72: The People Do Not Fear Authority**
If the people do not fear authority,
Then true authority will arise.
Do not confine their dwelling,
Do not exhaust their livelihood.
Only because they are not exhausted
Are they not exhausted.
Thus the Sage knows himself but does not reveal himself,
Loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Hence, he discards that and takes this.

Those who seek to make others fear and love them
Are all inwardly lacking yet outwardly covetous.
The Sage is complete within,
So others’ joy does not benefit him,
And their lack of fear does not harm him—
Thus he remains detached from all.

It is easy to make others fear me,
But difficult to make them not fear me.
It is easy to make me forget others,
But difficult to make the world forget me.
If the people do not fear authority,
It is because none in the world forgets me.
Is this not what is called the威 of virtue and Dao?

The Sage’s encounter with things
Follows their nature and finds ease.
Thus he does not confine their dwelling,
Nor exhaust their livelihood.
For what they dwell in and live on
Are not their true selves.
I alone am self-exhausted,
So none exhausts my life.
This is because I know myself yet do not reveal my knowing,
Love myself yet do not exalt my love.
If I had a heart of self-revelation and self-exaltation,
Then I would confine my dwelling,
Exhaust my livelihood—
And could not endure even a day.

**Chapter 73: Courage in Daring and Not Daring**
Courage in daring leads to killing;
Courage in not daring leads to life.
These two—one beneficial, one harmful—
Are what Heaven detests.
Who knows their reason?

Thus even the Sage finds them difficult.
The Way of Heaven
Conquers without contention, yet is effortless;
Responds without striving, yet is timely.
Comes without being summoned, yet is well-planned.
The Heavenly net is vast—
Wide yet never loses a thread.

All know courage in daring,
But none know courage in not daring.
Courage in daring is to tread upon white blades;
Courage in not daring is to tread the Middle Way.
Thus it is said:
White blades may be trodden,
But the Middle Way cannot be attained.

Comparing the two—
Treading white blades brings harm, yet men lightly esteem its harm;
Treading the Middle Way brings benefit, yet men do not know its benefit.
This is why the Middle Way is difficult.

Lightness in using courage is what men envy.
What Heaven detests—
Who knows its reason?
Even the Sage finds it difficult—
How much more so the common people?

For the Way of Heaven
Conquers without contention, yet is effortless;
Speaks without words, yet is responsive;
Comes without being summoned, yet is well-planned.
Yet it especially detests the use of courage.

Men, knowing that Heaven has not yet conquered,
That Heaven has not yet responded,
That its coming has not yet arrived,
That its planning is not yet fixed,
Speak boldly—
And sometimes the strong prevail, the brave win.
But observe it later, and then you will know:
The Heavenly net is vast—
Wide yet never loses a thread.

**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**
If the people do not fear death,
How can you frighten them with death?
If you make the people always fear death,
And execute those who act strangely,
Who dares?
There are always officials who execute.
He who substitutes for the executioner
Is called one who takes the place of the master carpenter to wield the axe.

He who substitutes for the executioner—
Few escape uninjured hands.

This chapter speaks of how the world’s punishments are insufficient to rely upon for governance.

If the people do not fear death,
How can I frighten them with death?
If I make the people truly fear death,
And seize and kill those who act strangely,
Then killing one man would suffice for governance.
Yet the more one kills, the more ungovernable it becomes—
Thus, punishments are insufficient to rely upon.

The Qin enforced strict laws, their nets tight,
Yet their crimes were unchecked.
The Han relaxed their laws, their nets let through fish as large as boats,
Yet the world turned to the Han.
This too is evident.

The Dao of Heaven rewards virtue and punishes licentiousness—
Those who execute, in the unseen, cannot escape.
If one insists on substituting for the executioner,
Like one who takes the place of the master carpenter to wield the axe,
There has never been one who did not injure his hand.

**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**
The people’s hunger stems from their rulers’ excessive taxation.
The people’s difficulty in governing arises from their rulers’ interference—
Thus, they are difficult to govern.
The people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ lavish living—
Thus, they treat death lightly.
Only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.
The more the ruler takes, the poorer the people become;
The more the ruler acts, the more the people are disordered—
This is inevitable.
If I seek to enrich their lives,
Yet disregard their lives,
If I am rich while they are poor,
How can they not treat death lightly?
The Sage regards life as a necessity.
How could he enrich his own life while depriving others of theirs?
This is called wiser than valuing life.

**Chapter 76: On Human Life**
Human life is soft and weak,
Yet death is hard and strong.
All things—grasses and trees—
Are soft and fragile when alive,
Yet wither and decay when dead.
Thus, the strong and rigid are the companions of death,
While the soft and weak are the companions of life.
Therefore, armies that are strong do not conquer,
Trees that are rigid snap,
The strong and great are beneath,
The soft and weak are above.
This chapter broadly speaks of how the soft and weak must live,
And the rigid and strong must die.
Though softness and weakness are not the Dao itself,
They approach *wuwei* (non-action).
Though rigidity and strength have not strayed from the Dao,
They verge on *youwei* (action).
*Wuwei* does not stray far from the Dao,
But *youwei* brings fortune and misfortune, regret and blame—
Thus, it strays further from the Dao.

**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**
The Dao of Heaven—
Is it not like drawing a bow?
The high are lowered, the low are raised,
The excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.
The Dao of Heaven supplements the deficient and diminishes the excessive.
But the Dao of humanity is not so.
It diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.
Who can use their excess to nourish the world?
Only the Sage.
Thus, the Sage acts yet does not rely upon it,
Completes his work yet does not dwell upon it,
Does not desire to be seen as virtuous.
To take from the many to benefit the few—
This is the Dao of Heaven.
To take from the few to benefit the many—
This is the Dao of humanity.
Only the Sage can further use his own excess to nourish others’ deficiencies,
Thus, his power extends to all things without relying on his power,
His achievements cover the world yet he does not claim them,
His benefits flow to the world yet he does not boast of his virtue—
Only the Sage can do this.

**Chapter 78: The World’s Softness and Weakness**
Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
Yet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the rigid and strong.
It has no equal.
The weak overcoming the strong,
The soft overcoming the rigid—
All know this, yet none can practice it.
Thus, the Sage says:
*"To bear the nation’s filth is to be its sovereign."*
*"To bear the nation’s misfortunes is to be its king."*
Water has no sentiment,
Yet it overcomes the rigid with its softness—
How much more so for things with sentiment?
The *Classic* says:
*"You, all the myriad regions, have guilt—
It lies with me alone.
My guilt alone—
Do not involve the myriad regions."*
The Three Dynasties once governed the people with this virtue.
This is called bearing the nation’s filth,
Bearing the nation’s misfortunes.

**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**
To reconcile great grievances will only leave lingering grievances—
How can this be considered good?
Thus, the Sage holds only the left contract,
And does not demand repayment from others.
Therefore, those with virtue oversee the contracts,
Those without oversee the reckoning.
The Dao of Heaven favors none—
It always sides with the virtuous.
Grievances cannot be reconciled,
Just as fire cannot be cooled,
Or water cannot be heated.
If one forces reconciliation,
There will surely be lingering grievances.
To consider this good is insufficient.
Thus, the Sage governs the world
As one who holds the left contract and seeks only the left contract—
Where do my favors and grievances come from?
It is like the matching of contracts and seals—
If they do not fit, one does not force what is not there,
Nor does one demand what is not owed.
The Sage’s governance of the world
Is like the overseer of contracts seeking perfect alignment—
Great or small, long or short—
He knows the contracts will fit on their own,
Yet he harbors no private bias.
If one insists on forcing a match,
That is the overseer of reckonings, not of contracts.
The Dao of Heaven is the same.
The Dao of Heaven favors none—
It never fails to reward the virtuous—
For it is merely the overseer of contracts.

**Chapter 80: Small States, Few People**
In small states with few people,
Let there be ten or a hundred skilled craftsmen, yet they are unused.
Let the people value life so much that they do not migrate far.
Though there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them.
Though there are arms and armor, they have no place to display them.
Let the people return to knotted cords for record-keeping.
Let their food be savory, their clothing beautiful,
Their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.
Neighboring states are visible, the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard,
Yet the people die of old age without ever traveling to one another.

In small states with few people,
The talents of ten or a hundred are employed.
If the talents of ten or a hundred are employed,
Then great talents are discarded.
If the people hold life lightly,
They will migrate far without hesitation—
If they migrate without hesitation, they will do whatever they please.
If there are ten or a hundred skilled craftsmen yet they are unused,
If the people cherish life and do not migrate far,
Then though there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them,
Though there are arms and armor, they have no place to display them,
Yet governance can return to knotted cords—
This too is acceptable.

「Let the people each find contentment in their own food, delight in their own attire,
And each find security in their own dwelling—
Though neighbors may be seen and heard,
They will not travel to one another,
Unless their clothing and food are sufficient and their desires few,
Then only may such a state be achieved.

**Chapter Eighty-One: Trustworthy Speech is Not Florid**
Trustworthy speech need not be florid,
Florid speech need not be trustworthy.
The virtuous do not argue,
Those who argue are not virtuous.
The wise do not amass knowledge,
Those who amass knowledge are not wise.
The sagely do not hoard—
When they give to others, they grow ever more abundant,
When they share with others, they grow ever more rich.

The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,
The Dao of the Sage acts without striving.
Those whose words are trustworthy need not be florid,
Florid words need not be trustworthy.
Those whose words are virtuous need not be eloquent,
Eloquent words need not be virtuous.
Those whose knowledge is true need not be vast,
Vast knowledge need not be true.
The Sage, in the Way,
Holds no grudging heart—
Not a hair’s breadth of stinginess.
Only the shallow and narrow-minded,
In their own shallow and narrow ways,
Doubt others as untrustworthy, unvirtuous, unwise—
Or drown in florid speech,
Or bewildered by eloquence,
Or lost in vast knowledge,
All unable to gain true understanding.

How could they know?
The Sage’s Dao is vast as the sea—
Giving without hoarding,
When he benefits others, he grows ever more abundant,
When he shares with others, he grows ever more rich.
I lament the world’s people for their small capacity,
Their narrow demands,
Unworthy of my giving.

Just as Heaven is—
Benefiting all without harming,
And all not striving against it.
Thus it is said of *Qián* (乾):
At its beginning, it could make all things beautiful and beneficial,
Yet spoke not of what it benefited—
Great indeed is its power!

**End of Volume Four of *The True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* #1**
*"Rán néng jiù wù"*—
*"Rán"* (然) is likely missing the character *"hòu"* (后).」
