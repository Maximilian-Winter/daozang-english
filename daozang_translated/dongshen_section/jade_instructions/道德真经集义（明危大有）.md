**Preface to the *Zhenjing of Daode***

The *Daode Jing*, both *Shang* (Upper) and *Xia* (Lower) chapters, comprises over five thousand words. Within it are encompassed the Dao of preserving and cultivating life’s essence, and without, the affairs of governance and harmonizing the world—none are omitted. This is the learning of *inner sage, outer king* (nèishèng wàiwáng).

The *Shǐ* (historians) placed it between *Shēn* and *Hán*, and the world thus came to call it the *Yellow Emperor’s Legalism*, which is vastly different from what the Daoist tradition truly holds—this cannot but be flawed.

When the Zhou declined and the Way of the Sage waned, its intent to save the age and benefit the people was embedded within, yet it was not solely about self-cultivation. Cao Pǎn, Marquis Gāo, found that *clearing and stillness, non-action* bore fruit in governance, and his application was not far from the practical principles of the age. How much more so for the teachings of withdrawal from the world, which were thereby greatly expanded!

Some, failing to grasp the profound origins of its meaning, dismiss it outright as empty, bizarre, and fanciful—how could such be true understanding of the Dao?

Over a hundred schools of commentary and exegesis have emerged since antiquity, each holding to their own interpretations. Yet the finest are those whose words and logic are comprehensive and coherent; if meaning is obscured or reasoning flawed, even elegant phrasing is of no worth.

Master Wēi Dàyǒu of Xū River, upright and resolute in his purpose, examined the works of all schools, selecting the most excellent to compile into this collection. He sought to have it engraved and printed for transmission, his diligence commendable. If those who truly savor its meaning seek beyond the words and embody it in body and mind, then the Dao of preserving life’s essence will flourish within, and the affairs of governance and harmony will manifest without.

Is the Dao divided? At his request, I thus presume to inscribe this preface.

In the year *Zhāoyáng*, the *wǔ* year of the *Dīng* cycle, on the *zhōu* day of the twelfth month, the 43rd-generation Celestial Master, Zhang Yǔchū, a disciple of the Three Caverns, respectfully composes this preface.

The *Daode Jing* is the ancestral scripture of our Dao. Its essence is *wuwei* (non-action, naturalness), its practice is *humility, retreat, kindness, and frugality*, and within it are all the methods for cultivation, governance, and harmonization—none are lacking.

The True Person Gé Xuān said: The five thousand words are the very source of *Daode*, encompassing all that is vast without exclusion, all that is minute without omission—the natural scripture of Heaven and humanity.

Master Ni Wénjié said: The five thousand words of Laozi are indeed the essential method for self-cultivation and governance, the finest remedy for saving the age and benefiting the world.

From this, it is clear that it is not merely the ancestral scripture of the Dao—how could the scriptures of the Three Teachings (Daoism, Confucianism, Buddhism) possess any other principle apart from this?

In the present age of sage and enlightened rule, it is especially revered, and a Daoist Bureau has been established to oversee its teachings. Future scholars must first master its doctrines before receiving ordination certificates. Yet alas, the world is in decline, and even its reading is unknown—how much less its meaning?

Master Wēi Dàyǒu, during his leisure from ritual duties, compared the commentaries of various schools, which sometimes differed, sometimes aligned, with merits and flaws alike. Scholars could not help but be confused. Thus, he gathered the interpretations of *Hé Shànggōng* and *Hé Xīnshān* and over ten other schools, selecting those whose elucidations were detailed and clear, whose logic was sound and consistent without strain, compiling them into two volumes—*The Daode Jing with Collected Meanings*—so that future scholars might know the definitive interpretation and avoid confusion from conflicting views.

As for those who, through understanding the meaning, illuminate the scripture, and through the scripture, construct the Dao, finding joy in the practice of *wuwei*—such persons are not absent.

In the year *Dīngmǎo* of the *Hóngwǔ* era, Master Wēi Dàyǒu of Xū River, incense burning, respectfully records this.

**The *Daode Jing with Collected Meanings* (Volume One)**
Compiled by **Wēi Dàyǒu of Xū River**

**Chapter One**
*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.*
*The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
The named is the mother of all things.*

**Commentary by Hé Zhī:**
The Dao is the primal *qi*, formless and void, a chaotic unity of nature. From it arise the two polarities (*èryī*), and all things derive their form. It cannot truly be named, yet we forcibly call it *Dao*. Thus, the opening line rightly begins with *Dao* alone, standing apart—just as in the passage *"The Dao is boundless, yet it acts"* (Chapter 4), where *Dao* is first proclaimed in reverence. By this, we see its supreme height and boundless greatness. Since the Dao establishes its name, both are declared together.

The lines *"The Dao that can be spoken"* and *"The name that can be named"* refer to the Dao’s methods being divided among the world, and names serving as their markers. *"The eternal Dao and eternal name"* speak of the void generating nature spontaneously, nature generating the Dao, and the ineffable beyond naming. If the Dao is truly eternal, then its name is eternal as well. What can be spoken and named are but temporary expressions. To say *"can"* implies both possibility and impossibility—how then can it be eternal? This is the paradox of forced naming. To say *"eternal"* denies both possibility and impossibility—how then can it change? This is the natural way of things.

The Dao is its essence; the name is its function. Both existence (*yǒu*) and nonexistence (*wú*) are names. The Dao originates in nonexistence—vast and empty—thus naming the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Things arise from existence—vibrant and flourishing—thus naming the mother of all things.

**Commentary by Lǐ Zhī:**
The Dao is the void and natural, the eternal Way. Originally, it cannot be spoken of; the Dao that *can* be spoken is not the eternal Dao. The primal *qi* of origins transforms into all heavens, adapting to time and change. The Dao itself is formless; the names we give it are not its true names. Heaven and Earth move and transform, nurturing all things, manifesting in tangible forms and names.

**Commentary by Lín Zhī:**
The Dao cannot be put into words. The moment speech is applied, it falls into the second order of meaning. Thus, one must observe it without desire to grasp its subtlety, and with desire to perceive its boundaries. Though these two approaches differ in name, they both arise from the same source and are called *Xuan* (mysterious).

**Commentary by Hé Zhī (continued):**
*"Constant nonexistence"* is not absolute nonexistence—it has always been so, hence *"constant."* As in *The Liezi*: *"The Great Ease"* saw no *qi*; *"The Great Beginning"* was the start of *qi*; *"The Great Commencement"* was the start of form; *"The Great Purity"* was the start of substance. Following this sequence leads to confusion, hence it is called *"mixed and indistinct."* Observing it in nonexistence reveals its profound mystery.

*"Constant existence"* is not temporary existence—it is always so, hence *"constant."* As in *The Liezi*: *"The Ease transforms into Oneness; Oneness transforms into Seven; Seven transforms into Nine; Nine transforms back into Oneness."* Oneness is the beginning of form. It is also said: *"When there is form, it returns to formlessness."* Observing it in existence reveals its inevitable return. The character *jiào* (徼) in both Laozi and Liezi commentaries means *"return"*—the return to its resting place. As in *The Zhuangzi*: *"To reach the void and fulfill one’s seeking, to roam freely and grasp its end."* Here, the one and the none are observed together, and only what one does not seek to observe is not the Dao.

These two approaches share the same origin but differ in name. The *Daode Jing* states: *"All things under Heaven arise from existence; existence arises from nonexistence."* Thus, their origin is the same, though their names differ. The subtle nonexistence is not nonexistence; the manifest existence is not existence. Hence, *"The eternal can make the nonexistent exist; the nonexistent can make the eternal manifest."* Existence and nonexistence share the same name as *"eternal,"* thus both are called *Xuan*. Existence and nonexistence are one; nonexistence is inherently *Xuan*, and existence is also *Xuan*, hence *"they are the same in mystery."* The *Daode Jing* says: *"All things arise together; I observe their return."* The three observations—*"subtle," "boundaries,"* and *"return"*—later reveal that *"return"* encompasses both *"subtle"* and *"boundaries."*

**Commentary by Lín Zhī (continued):**
The lines *"constant nonexistence, constant existence"* teach the ultimate realization. The word *"desire"* here carries deep meaning—it signifies *"seeking."* One seeks this ultimate truth. Though existence and nonexistence appear as two, they share the same source despite differing names. If one constantly observes both nonexistence and existence, they are both called *Xuan*. *Xuan* is the marvel of creation. By observing thus, Laozi does not exclusively uphold emptiness. If he did, he would not say *"they share the same source"* or *"both are called Xuan."*

**Commentary by Ní Zhī:**
Existence and nonexistence are both eternal aspects of the Dao. *"Constant nonexistence"* is the Dao before manifestation; *"constant existence"* is the Dao in manifestation. The Dao is eternally nonexistent yet eternally existent—existence and nonexistence generate each other and cannot be separated. The Dao’s nonexistence invites observation of its subtlety—the refined essence within. The Dao’s existence invites observation of its boundaries—the coarse manifestations at its edges. The world mistakenly claims Laozi speaks only of nonexistence, yet in this opening chapter, he presents both existence and nonexistence equally, never favoring one over the other. This reveals his intent in composing the text. Many commentators mistakenly split the lines into *"without desire"* and *"with desire."* Desire is the obstruction of the Dao—without it, one may proceed. How could there ever be *"with desire"*?

「○ Master Lü said: To observe the subtle is to gaze within. The subtle is the divine—divine in its transformation of all things, yet expressed through speech. Thus, the practice of inward observation restrains the restless mind, halts the cravings of desire, gathers the divine radiance, consolidates the pure *qi*, and solidifies the embryonic true essence.

The *Dao De Jing* of the Supreme Sage contains the methods of inward and fixed observation, while the *Dao* of immortals and true ones teaches the techniques of *shōushì fǎn tīng* (withdrawing sight and reversing hearing). The *Zhēnjié* states: Inward observation is the root of spiritual immortality. *Jiào* (boundaries) refers to the edges and limits, as well as to the return (to the source).

○ Master Dong said: All that is distant and without ultimate reach must be profound in hue—its essence is the boundless depth of the human heart, where no form is manifest. This is the meaning of *yānmò* (profound silence) in the *Guan Yin Zi*—the unmeasurable, the indivisible. Thus, he speaks of *Tiān* (Heaven), *Mìng* (Fate), *Shén* (Divine), and *Xuán* (Mysterious), all converging in the term *Dao* (Way).

○ Some say: Why do all the schools interpret the passage as *"constant nonexistence"* and *"constant existence with desire"* when you alone take *"constant nonexistence and constant existence"*? I say: The schools’ interpretation is not without logic, but it fails to align with the deeper *Xuán* (Mysterious) meaning of the subsequent text. If existence is paired with desire, how can it be called *Xuán*? Again, those who cling to desire perish themselves—yet to perish is to attain *Xuán*, is this possible?

Another school suggests that *"constant existence with desire"* refers to the practice of skillful application, which is not without brilliance, yet it is also overly strained.

It is better to take *"constant nonexistence and constant existence"* as absolute—simple yet profound in meaning. Thus, I adhere to this reading.

*"Mysterious yet again mysterious—
the gateway to all subtleties."*

○ Master He said: The subtleties are indeed subtle, yet the boundaries are also subtle—hence, *"all subtleties."* The gateway refers to their origin. Many read this chapter only in terms of Heaven and Earth, yet the Sage’s intent is to be grasped from the heart.

○ Master Lü said: The *Xuán* (Mysterious) is the ultimate of subtlety. Again, *Xuán* is Heaven—*Xuán* within *Xuán* is Heaven within Heaven. The *Yùluó Xiāotái* (Jade Tower of Obscurity), the *Yùshān Shàngjīng* (Jade Mountain Upper Palace), in the human body are the Heavenly Valleys and Divine Precincts of the brain and blood. They are the crystalline chamber of vital fluids, the source of the essence, and the dwelling of the hundred spirits—where the Great Lord of Self-Sustaining Life resides. When one observes with the divine essence the Heaven within Heaven, the embryonic immortality forms itself, the Heavenly Gate opens, and all spirits enter and exit through it. Hence, it is called *"the gateway to all subtleties."*

○ Master Chái said: The unfolding and closing of *Yīn* and *Yáng* (the cosmic forces), the emergence and retreat of essence and function—what more does this gate encompass?

○ Master Liú said: *"Mysterious yet again mysterious"* speaks of the origin of all things in their natural state—this is the gateway through which all subtleties pass. This chapter first discusses the *Dao*, then Heaven and Earth, and finally the human heart—it is now complete. Scholars should reflect upon it in silence.

○ Master Dong said: Both principle and phenomenon arise from this gate—hence, *"the gateway to all subtleties."*

**Chapter Two:**
When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
then it is ugliness.
When all under Heaven know goodness as goodness,
then it is not goodness.

○ Master He said: The *Dao* is formless yet all-encompassing, a symbol without substance. It molds and transforms, and thus all the beauty of Heaven and Earth is contained within it. The interplay of *Yīn* and *Yáng* (cosmic forces) nurtures virtue and completes nature—those who know this are better off forgetting what they know. How much more so when all under Heaven claim to know it!

Thus, to know beauty as beauty is not as good as to not know it as beauty—this is the ultimate beauty.
When people know what is beautiful, beauty harbors ugliness, for their knowledge is shallow.
To know goodness as goodness is not as good as to not know it as goodness—this is the ultimate goodness.
When people know what is good, goodness harbors not-goodness, for their knowledge is superficial.

○ Master Lü said: The sage who embodies the *Dao* and fulfills virtue blends with all things, equal to their natural state. When all under Heaven know his beauty as beauty, I do not know it as beauty; when they know his goodness as goodness, I do not know it as goodness. In perfect harmony with all things, transcending duality, how could there be beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness?

The world fails to awaken to the truth that things were not always manifest. Lost in private perception, some take appearance, sound, and color as beauty, while others take wealth and honor as goodness. Once the deluded mind arises, they may praise what is ugly or what is not goodness. What is now rejected may later be embraced; what was once approved may now be condemned. Then, what choice is there between beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness?

○ Master Wú said: The names of beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness, arise in relation to one another. Because ugliness exists, beauty exists; because not-goodness exists, goodness exists. When all know this as beauty, then that is ugliness; when all know this as goodness, then that is not-goodness. To erase both, to return them to the void, then neither beauty nor ugliness, goodness nor not-goodness, exists.

○ Master Lín said: This chapter embodies the meaning of *"having yet not dwelling"*—when beauty is known, ugliness arises; when goodness is known, not-goodness arises. Beauty unknown as beauty, goodness unknown as goodness—then there is no ugliness, no not-goodness.

Thus, existence and nonexistence generate each other,
difficulty and ease complete each other,
long and short define each other,
high and low depend on each other,
sounds and responses harmonize each other,
before and after follow each other.

○ Master He said: To speak of nonexistence is to imply existence;
to speak of existence is to imply nonexistence—this is their generation.
Difficulty arises from ease,
ease is shaped by difficulty—this is their completion.
A foot may be short where a cubit is long,
a high bank becomes a valley—this is their interdependence.
The crane’s call is answered by its mate,
as sounds and responses follow one another—
just as before and after, goodness and not-goodness,
beauty and ugliness, stand in constant opposition under Heaven.
The shallow in knowledge and perception,
knowing beauty and goodness,
are not as good as those who do not recognize them—
this is the ultimate goodness and beauty.

○ Master Lǐ said: Existence arises from nonexistence,
nonexistence arises from existence.
Difficulty transforms into ease,
ease transforms into difficulty.
The long brings forth the short,
the short brings forth the long.
Once there is high, there must be low—
sounds must harmonize in response,
before must follow after, after must follow before.
Thus, existence and nonexistence,
difficulty and ease,
are mutually dependent.
Beauty brings forth ugliness,
goodness brings forth not-goodness.»

○ **Master Lü said:** Once the Two Principles [Yin-Yang] are established, all things exist in pairs, thus they generate one another through existence and nonexistence, perfect one another through difficulty and ease, take form through long and short, incline through high and low, harmonize through sound, and follow through before and after—all motion arises from deliberate action.

○ **Master Lin said:** These six sentences all illustrate the meaning of beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness from above.

○ **Ouyang Xiu said:** The following of before and after, the forming of long and short—when extended broadly, this is the principle of all things.

Though the *Dao De Jing* speaks as if of emptiness and nothingness, its teachings on governing the people are profound indeed. Therefore, the Sage acts in non-action and governs through silent instruction.

○ **Master He said:** The Sage knows nonexistence and grasps the pivotal mechanism of knowledge, thus while others engage in affairs, the Sage dwells in non-affairs, finding amusement in the interplay of things—what concern does the Sage have for affairs?

Others speak endlessly, yet the Sage practices speechless speech. Though never uttering words, standing beside others, the Sage transforms them—what concern does the Sage have for speech?

○ **Master Lü said:** Existence and nonexistence, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, sound and voice, before and after—though these exist in pairs, they inevitably entail entanglement. Thus, the Sage abandons things and departs from people, standing alone above all things, not pairing with anything. As the *Classic* says: *"Standing alone yet unchanging, nothing can pair with it."* Therefore, the Sage practices non-action, does nothing, forgets speech and forgets images, silently resonating with Nature—how could such a one rely on mere sounds?

The *Zhuangzi* speaks of the utmost action as departing from action, the utmost speech as departing from speech—hence, *"The Sage acts in non-action and governs through silent instruction."*

All things arise yet the Sage does not claim them, they are born yet the Sage does not possess them, the Sage acts yet does not rely on it, completing the work yet does not dwell upon it. Only because the Sage does not dwell upon it does it never depart.

○ **Master He said:** The Sage acts, and all things observe; all things act, yet how could the Sage refuse responsibility for their arising? Though the Sage does not claim them as possession or rely upon them, the work belongs to the Sage—this cannot be rejected, for it is inevitable, not the Sage’s intention.

○ **Master Lin said:** Heaven and Earth generate ten thousand transformations without ceasing—how could they refuse their labor? All things fill Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth never claim possession. As spring brings life and autumn brings death, yet Nature never boasts of its power—thus, *"They are born yet the Sage does not possess them, acts yet does not rely on it."* The meaning lies in completing the work yet not dwelling upon it, hence these three phrases illuminate it.

*"Action"* is akin to the *Yijing*’s *"Kun"* nurturing all things—this is the meaning of Shun and Yu ruling without claiming ownership. Those who possess what they have cannot truly possess it; those who do not possess what they have can truly possess it. The *Book of Documents* says: *"Having virtue, yet losing it."* Thus, *"Only because the Sage does not dwell upon it does it never depart."*

○ **Master Li said:** Not refusing, not possessing, not relying, not dwelling—each forgets the other, and existence and nonexistence stand annulled. Thus, the True One endures eternally and never departs.

○ **Master Lü said:** The Sage embodies the Dao within, yet his mind labors not; his responses to things are without measure. Thus, all things arise together, and he responds spontaneously—like a valley echoing sound, beauty and ugliness alike come to him without refusal. Hence, *"All things arise together yet the Sage does not refuse."*

Self-formed, self-colored, self-generated, self-transformed—each fulfills its small or great nature, completing its essence. Who possesses it?

The *Guan Yinzi* says: *"Things are not mine, yet I cannot but respond; I am not myself, yet I cannot but nourish."* Thus, responding to things yet never possessing them, nourishing oneself yet never possessing oneself—hence, *"They are born yet the Sage does not possess them."*

Benefiting ten thousand generations yet not claiming it as benevolence, covering Heaven and Earth yet not claiming it as greatness—hence, *"The Sage acts yet does not rely on it."* The work covers the world yet seems not to emerge from the Sage; to acknowledge it would be confusion—hence, *"The work is complete yet the Sage does not dwell upon it."*

If there is dwelling, there is departure—this is true of past and present. Within oneself, there is no dwelling; thus, things cannot displace it.

Only because the Sage does not dwell upon it, does not possess it, does not rely on it—thus, soaring with things above all things yet remaining unchanged, never departing.

○ **Master Wu said:** *"Action"* refers to things about to arise. Not refusing, not possessing, not relying, not dwelling—these are the non-actions of Heaven and Earth. Not departing means enduring forever. Heaven and Earth do not dwell upon completing their work, thus their work endures eternally and never departs.

○ **Master Dong said:** This chapter guides learners to a place where name and trace are both forgotten.

**Chapter Three:**
Do not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend.
Do not treasure rare goods, so the people do not become thieves.
Do not display what is desirable, so the heart does not become disordered.

○ **Master Li said:** If one does not boast of one’s own virtue, the people become pure. If one does not treasure rare goods, the people become wealthy. If one does not display what is desirable, the heart becomes settled.

○ **Master Wu said:** *"Exalt"* means to honor; *"treasure"* means to value highly; *"display"* is akin to showing. If one does not exalt, does not treasure, it is as if one does not show what is desirable, thus the people’s hearts do not contend. Not becoming thieves is the same as not becoming disordered.

○ **Master Lin said:** *"Exalt"* is the same as *"boast."* If I boast of my virtue, then contention will arise throughout the world. Yu alone did not boast, and thus no one contended with him—this is the meaning.

If I value rare goods as treasures, then all people will have desires to obtain them, and their ruin will lead to theft. Only if one does not show what is desirable will the heart naturally settle.

Therefore, the Sage empties the mind, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones.

○ **Master Li said:** *"Empty the mind"* is to preserve one’s nature. *"Fill the belly"* is to preserve one’s life.

Weakening the will, this is to preserve the spirit. Strengthening the bones, this is to preserve the form.

○ **Master Lü said:** Earlier, it was said that one should not value rare goods, not show what is desirable—this is the same as emptying the mind. Not exalting virtue is the same as weakening the will. If one says only that the mind must be emptied, there is fear of sinking into dull emptiness. If one says only that the will must be weakened, there is fear of failing to stand firm. Therefore, the Sage’s cultivation of the self must include emptying the mind, filling the belly, weakening the will, and strengthening the bones. The empty must be paired with the full, the weak with the strong. A luminous spirit hall clears and brightens; a vacant chamber generates purity—untainted by a single speck of dust—this is emptying the mind. Once emptied, if one cannot inhale and exhale the Great Harmony, chew the essence of *Hāngzǐ*, drink the motherless *Xuānyīng*, or consume the celestial *Tiānguān* of the Great *Dàfán*, how can one fill the belly? Merely guarding the emptiness of nature—how could one then transcend the mortal coil, ascend in broad daylight?

Thus, it is clear that emptying the mind and filling the belly must not be neglected.

To humble oneself and remain lowly, to govern oneself with meekness—this is weakening the will. Though the will is weakened, if one cannot speak of the Dao in action, there will be nothing to establish oneself upon. How then could one achieve what the *Yijing* says: *"Heaven’s movement is vigorous; the superior man strengthens himself with unremitting effort"*? Those who refine internally may twist and turn against the flow, ascending through the Three Passes to nourish the brain—when the brain is full, the bones grow strong. Weakening the will and strengthening the bones must not be neglected—this is also clear.

○ **Master He said:** Emptying the mind is purifying the origin and transcending the root. Filling the belly is accumulating essence and piling up *qi*. Separating the principles of emptiness and fullness, the spirit is preserved. Weakening the will is concentrating *qi* to achieve softness. Strengthening the bones is hearing the Dao and diligently practicing it. Following the yielding of *Kūn* and the vigor of *Qián*, virtue is preserved.

○ **Master Chái said:** If one does not exalt oneself, does not value goods, and has no desires, then the mind naturally becomes empty and luminous, and the belly’s *qi* naturally fills. When the mind is empty of all things, the will becomes gentle and harmonious. When the belly is nourished, the bones grow strong. If one constantly keeps the people without knowledge or desire, then those who are wise dare not act. To act without action is to govern without failing.

○ **Master He said:** When spirit and virtue are both complete, there is naturally a transformation without words, guiding the people without their knowing it. What was once known is now forgotten; what was once desired is now abandoned. As *Zhuangzi* says: *"In harmony with the unknown, virtue does not depart. In harmony with the desireless, this is called pristine simplicity."* When the people return to their natural simplicity, how could they dare to act selfishly or scheme for others? The common people dare not act; the ruler acts without action. The subtle effect of perfect governance leaves no trace to follow.

○ **Master Lin said:** In ancient times, the people were pure and simple, knowing nothing, desiring nothing. Though some among them had clever and scheming minds, even if their knowledge took root, they dared not act upon it. The Sage governs the world in this way. The Sage, in the world, has no place for the mind. In governance, all is done through *wuwei*, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.

○ **Master Lü said:** *Wuwei* is the Dao. The Sage proclaims the Dao from above, and the people respond in harmony from below. Morning and evening, in times of chaos or order, the Dao is the only path. Without the Dao, one does not act; without the Dao, one does not speak. All actions must align with the Dao of *wuwei*. If one acts with deliberate action, the mind labors and the body grows weary, ending in exhaustion. But if one acts through *wuwei*—even if one consumes elixirs of refined essence, breathes celestial *qi*, rinses and swallows cloudy nectar, or refines the mysterious pearl—ascending to the heavens and coiling upon the earth, wielding marvelous transformations, with the body perfectly attuned—then it is said: *"To act without action is to govern without failing."*

○ **Master Dòng said:** This chapter speaks of forgetting exalted virtues, erasing thought, and returning to *wuwei* in harmony with the ultimate truth.

**Chapter Four**
The Dao is boundless yet applied—sometimes it does not fill.
Deep as the source of all things.

○ **Master Wú said:** *"Or"* is a word of doubt, not certainty. The Dao’s essence is empty; those who use the Dao must also remain empty and unfilled. If filled, it is no longer the Dao. *"Deep"* means unfathomable. *"Source"* is the ancestral root, the lineage’s foundation. The Dao is the foundation of all things, hence *"the source of all things."* *"Seems"* is another word of doubt, used in praise.

○ **Master He said:** *"Boundless"* means empty. The Dao’s highest use lies in its emptiness. *Zhuangzi* knew that only when one understands the useless can one speak of use. If filled, the center is not empty, and its use is limited. *"Seems"*—how difficult it is to speak of it directly! This is the utmost emptiness.

○ **Master Lin said:** *"Boundless"* means empty. Though the Dao’s essence is empty, its application is inexhaustible—sometimes filled, sometimes not, adapting to the moment. *"Seems"* is a word of doubt used in praise. *"The source of all things"* is what *Zhuangzi* called the Great Master.

○ **Master Lǐ said:** *"The Dao is boundless yet applied—sometimes it does not fill"* means not being self-satisfied. Those who are not self-satisfied will inevitably benefit, blunting sharpness and resolving conflicts through the emptiness of the center and forgetting the self.

○ **Master Lü said:** Heaven’s first creation is water, whose use lies in the center, hence *"boundless."* The character for *"boundless"* combines water and center, speaking of the true One’s water within *qi*. This is called *"boundless."* Boundless is *qi*; boundless is harmony. The True Person of Jin Hua said: *"Boundless harmony enters the body to vitalize; the spirit of the grain knows the boundless use of ascension to Kunlun."* This is the true speech of the Dao’s boundless application. Yan Junping said: *"Boundless takes emptiness as its dwelling; harmony takes non-action as its home. Using emptiness and non-being, one naturally avoids excess."*

---

Because it does not overflow, it is profound—like the origin of all things.
For the profound is the deepest and unfathomable, the most tranquil and unmoved.
The origin of all things is none other than the Dao itself.
The origin is the ancestor: from One it generates Two, from Two it generates Three, and from Three it generates all things.
Thus, is the Dao not the ancestral origin of all things?

It blunts the sharp, resolves the tangled, harmonizes the radiant, and aligns with the mundane.

Master Wu said: The spoken is always dull, the luminous must dim—
just as the full inevitably overflows.
The Dao does not seek fullness, so it blunts the sharp and does not wish it dull,
it harmonizes the radiant and does not wish it bright—
these four lines speak of the Dao’s non-overflowing use.

Master Lin said:
To blunt the sharp is to smooth away all jaggedness.
To resolve the tangled is to order chaos with serene precision.
To harmonize the radiant is to shine without revealing.
To align with the mundane is to be unstained yet unconcerned with purity.

Master Li said:
To blunt the sharp and resolve the tangled,
to harmonize the radiant and align with the mundane—
this is the emptiness of the center and forgetting the self.

Master Lü said:
To blunt the sharp is to crush the rigid, sharp *qi* of fame and gain,
to dwell in simplicity, revealing no edges.
To resolve the tangled is to untangle the clamor of disturbance,
to remain silent and detached, not engaging with things.
The radiant refers to brilliance; the mundane refers to worldly affairs.
As *Zhuangzi* says: *"The vast and settled emit celestial light."*
The Confucian says: *"Filled and luminous is called great."*
Now, using boundlessness as principle, it is like the lush light of Heaven,
the essence of sun and moon flowing into the limbs—
within, already filled and luminous, so naturally does radiance emerge,
purely manifesting on face and back, differing from common folk.
When boundless harmony is truly realized within,
the six *qi* also manifest externally—
one must only be gentle, yielding, and unassuming,
blending into the world like dust, coexisting without distinction,
otherwise people will point to you as arrogant, eccentric, and unorthodox.

Master He said:
How is it empty? By blunting the sharp, resolving the tangled,
harmonizing the radiant, and aligning with the mundane.
These four vanish without trace—
then the heart is like the Great Void,
the *grain spirit* responds with emptiness,
the Dao acts through boundlessness.
This chapter twice speaks of "as if,"—
these are living phrases, to be savored deeply.

Deep and as if it exists.
Master Wu said:
*Deep* means tranquil stillness—
the Dao’s essence is empty, hence its presence here.
As if it exists, yet nothing truly abides.

This line speaks of the Dao’s emptiness.

Master Lü said:
*Deep* is clear and luminous, as if it exists yet does not—
the form of neither presence nor absence.
Gazing upward, it grows ever higher;
probing it, it grows ever firm;
glancing ahead, it is before you—
suddenly, it is behind.

Master Lin said:
As if present, as if absent,
as if real, as if void—
thus, *deep and as if it exists.*

I do not know whose child I am,
the ancestor before the Sovereign.

Master Wu said:
*"I do not know whose child I am"*—a question.
*"The ancestor before the Sovereign"*—an answer.
*Sovereign* speaks of Heaven’s form; *ancestor* speaks of Heaven’s ruler.
Heaven too arises from the Dao, hence *"the ancestor before the Sovereign."*

Master Li said:
*The ancestor before the Sovereign*—before the *Taiji* divided.

Master Lü said:
The *Huangting Jing* asks, *"Who’s child am I within my body?"*
This is *"I do not know whose child I am."*
It is the self’s true nature, eternally present since antiquity,
aging not in ancient times—hence *"the ancestor before the Sovereign."*

Master Dong said:
This chapter speaks of the wondrous root of boundless emptiness,
and its unfathomable use.

**Chapter Five**
Heaven and Earth are not *ren*, treating all things as straw dogs.
The Sage is not *ren*, treating the people as straw dogs.

Master Wu said:
*Ren* means to cherish with intent.
A straw dog is grass bound into a dog’s shape, used in rain rituals.
Once the ritual ends, it is discarded—no further care is given.
Heaven and Earth cherish nothing, yet allow all things to arise and complete themselves.
The Sage cherishes no one, yet lets the people act and rest as they will.
Thus, the straw dog is the analogy—
for the Sage’s heart is empty, with nothing to cling to.
If the Sage cherished the people, the heart would not be empty.

Master Lin said:
*Nurturing* is *ren*—
Heaven and Earth nurture things yet claim no merit, forgetting themselves with things.
The Sage nourishes the people yet claims no virtue, forgetting himself with the people.
*Not-ren* means not possessing *ren*.
A straw dog is used in sacrifice, then cast aside—
this illustrates forgetfulness without attachment.

The Classic says:
*"The highest virtue lacks virtue, hence it has virtue."*
Not-*ren* is like not possessing virtue.
*Zhuangzi* says: *"Great *ren* is not *ren*."*
And again: *"In the age of perfect virtue, they love one another without calling it *ren*."*
This is the same meaning.

Master Lü said:
Heaven and Earth, without favor, yet great favor arises.
The Sage, not-*ren*, yet great virtue is fulfilled—
because they are without self.
Heaven covers without partiality, Earth bears without favor,
the Sage transforms without attachment—
when it should be born, it is born; when it should die, it dies.
Only the Original *qi* moves—
Heaven, Earth, and the Sage never interfere with their own hearts.
It is like the straw dog.

*Shu* is grass; bound *shu* forms a dog for sacrifice,
honored with reverence when in use—
wrapped in fine silk, adorned with embroidery,
the officiant fasting and solemn in attendance.
But once the ritual ends,
passersby tread upon it, cooks burn it—
merely discarded, of no further use.

「Master Lü said:
At the times of spring’s birth and summer’s growth,
Heaven and Earth seem to bestow boundless love—
yet when autumn and winter come,
and all things wither and fall,
Heaven and Earth cannot save what they once gave life to.

The Sage, in times of pity and nurturing,
appears to act with great compassion—
yet when death arrives,
the Sage cannot rescue what must perish.

It is like honoring the straw dog before sacrifice,
then discarding it after the ritual ends.
Before the sacrifice, it must be revered—
after the sacrifice, it must be cast aside.
Thus, the straw dog serves as a metaphor for the birth and death of all things and people,
showing Heaven, Earth, and the Sage’s lack of partiality.
It is through their *not-ren* that their greatness is revealed.

Master Li said:
Heaven covers without favor, Earth bears without favor,
transforming and nurturing the people and all things—
this can be called the utmost *ren*.
But to say they are not-*ren* is to forget their own nature.

The Sage loves the people and governs the state,
and likewise cultivates the self and preserves life—
between Heaven and Earth, it is akin to the *túshuǐ* [1].

Empty yet unyielding,
moving yet ever producing—
the more one speaks, the more one exhausts,
yet better to hold fast to the center.

Master Wu said:
The *túshuǐ* is an instrument for blowing wind and igniting fire.
Between Heaven and Earth, it is like the *túshuǐ*—
discarding form, embracing the Great Void [2],
containing all things without limit.
The *shuǐ* symbolizes the Original *qi* [3],
its *yīnyūn* [4] and flowing movement.

To say it is "unyielding" means its motion is direct,
and "ever producing" means life is endless.
Only its emptiness as a *tú*,
and its transformative function as a *shuǐ*,
—where transformation is constant—
thus its motion as *shuǐ* and its endless generation of life.

In Heaven and Earth, it is so—
and in humans, it is the same:
when the heart is empty of all things,
and the *qi*’s pathways are unobstructed,
then the Original *qi* moves with regularity,
and the life generated from the void grows ever more abundant.

"Exhausted" means swift depletion,
and "exhaustion" refers to *qi*’s depletion.
If a person speaks too much, their *qi* is consumed,
thus hastening its exhaustion.

Better to keep the heart empty,
firmly guarding the spirit [5],
so that nothing from outside enters,
and nothing from within escapes—
then the void within has no bounds,
and the life generated from it also knows no end.

Master Lin said:
The *túshuǐ* is used and wind arises,
its form though empty, yet when applied, it is unyielding.
Move it, and wind is produced—
the more it moves, the more it yields.
Between Heaven and Earth,
its generation of all things is likewise—
how could it harbor a heart for the wind?

Heaven and Earth, in giving life to all things,
how could they harbor a heart for them?
Thus, this metaphor is used.»

Excessive speech leads to swift depletion—
better to guard the center,
for Heaven and Earth’s Dao cannot be exhausted by words.
Too much speech only hastens one’s own exhaustion.
Better to remain silent and forget speech,
as Confucius said:
*“I wish to speak not at all—
what words could Heaven have?
The four seasons pass in their course,
and all things are born from them.”*
This is the very meaning.

○ Master Li said:
This chapter concludes the meaning of *chōng* (emptiness) and its application.
Between Heaven and Earth, it is like the *túshuǐ*—
its emptiness within,
its unyielding stillness—
no mind.
When moved, it yields ever more—
endless responsiveness to change.
“Better to guard the center”
is nothing but this emptiness within.

○ Master Lǚ’s text records:
The True Person of the Marvelous Dao asked Laozi:
*“What is the most essential chapter for cultivating the Dao and refining the body?”*
Laozi replied:
*“It is ‘Guarding the Center, Embracing the One, Deep Roots, Firm Foundation.’”*
The True Person asked:
*“What is meant by ‘guarding the center’?”*
Laozi said:
*“The center is the Central Palace.
Consider the infant in the womb—
its navel cord connects to the mother’s,
drawing her *qi* in darkness.
When she inhales, it inhales;
when she exhales, it exhales.
For ten months, its *qi* is full, its spirit complete.
At birth, it detaches from the cord—
just as a fruit, once ripe, falls from the tree.
The space three inches deep between the navel is called the Central Palace,
also the Yellow Court.
In men, it is the *Qi Sea*;
in women, the womb.
I was once taught by the Dao Sovereign of the Highest:
‘Diligently guard the center,
never let it stray.
Keep the outer from entering,
the inner from escaping.
Return to the Original Source—
all matters will then be complete.’
‘Diligently guard the center’ means
fixing one’s mind on the Original Sea.
‘Not letting it escape’ means
letting the breath’s coming and going
settle naturally within the Central Palace,
never letting it disperse outward.
‘Returning to the Original Source’ means
the navel is the origin of twelve thousand five hundred breaths,
the root of the *qi* for the five *zàng* and six *fǔ*.
By returning the breath to its source
and guiding it with the spirit,
one makes the breath steady and still.’*

**Chapter Six: The Immortal Valley-Spirit, Called the Mysterious Female**

○ Master Lǚ said:
*“Valley”* refers to Heaven’s Valley,
*“spirit”* to the original spirit of the body.
Heaven’s Valley contains the transformations,
holds the void and emptiness;
Earth’s Valley contains all things,
bears mountains and rivers.
Humans, sharing the same origin as Heaven and Earth,
also possess a Valley.
Within it dwells the True One,
the abode of the original spirit.
Thus, the head has nine palaces,
corresponding to the nine heavens.
The central palace is called the *Níwán* (Mud Ball),
also the Purple Treasury.
Beyond the nine palaces lies another,
with many names:
*Liáotiān* (Boundless Heaven),
*Tiānguān* (Heavenly Pass),
*Yùjīngshān* (Jade Capital Mountain),
*Kūnlún’s Peak*,
*Tàyuān Pool*,
and *Tiāngǔ* (Heavenly Valley)—
the palace where the original spirit resides.
Its emptiness is like a valley,
and the spirit dwells within—
thus it is called the *Valley-Spirit*.
When the spirit remains, life continues;
when it departs, death follows.
Even during the day, as one interacts with things,
or at night, when lost in dreams,
the spirit is unsettled in its dwelling.
If it leaves and does not return,
wandering without return,
then the path of life and death is severed.
Thus, it is said:
Humans cannot live without the spirit’s life,
nor die without the spirit’s death.
Yet the Valley-Spirit does not die—
because of the *Mysterious Female*.

*Xuán* (Mysterious) is the Yang,
Heaven.
*Pìn* (Female) is the Yin,
Earth.
The Mysterious is Heaven’s color—
pure Yang, the void *qi* of emptiness,
light and clear, floating in Heaven.
Its character is composed of *wú* (none) and *huǒ* (fire),
arising from the void,
dwelling in the Mysterious Original Palace—
thus it is called *Mysterious*.
The Female is Earth’s nature—
pure Yin, the substantial *qi* of the valley,
heavy and turbid, sinking into Earth.
Its character is composed of *qì* (breath) and *mǐ* (rice),
arising from substance,
dwelling in the Female Original Treasury—
thus it is called *Female*.
The two *qi* rise and fall between inhalation and exhalation.
There is a method to regulate them:
Reverse their natural flow,
so that Yin does not grow excessive,
and restore their origin,
so that Yang does not weaken.
Transform the having into the void,
the void into having—
using the substantial *qi* of the Original Earth
to ascend and expel it,
and the void *qi* of Heaven’s Original
to descend and return it.
When Heaven’s *qi* returns to the body,
the turbid Yin naturally dissipates,
restoring one to pure Yang.
Thus it is said:
*“Return the Heavenly *qi* above
to govern the nine heavens’ souls.”*
Therefore, the Mysterious Female’s two *qi*
each hold profound meaning—
unless one meets a sage
who transmits oral instructions,
they cannot be known.
If one knows the origin of the two *qi*,
then one knows the mystery of the Mysterious Female.
Nourish the *Tàihé* (Great Harmony),
inherit the *Qi Mother*,
to nourish the spirit.
The spirit depends on its darkness,
returning to the Valley—
thus it does not die.
Is this not the function of the Mysterious Female?
Thus it is said:
*“The Valley-Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Female.”*
From the *Língshū Shénjǐng Neijing*:
*“Heaven’s Valley, the original spirit—
guard it, and it will remain true.
Above and below, the Mysterious Female—
child and mother in harmony.”*
It is also said:
*“The Mysterious Female is the vessel of Heaven and Earth;
seize it with the spirit,
obtain it with the true—
the way of ascent and descent.”*

○ Master Hé said:
*“Valley”* is emptiness,
the dwelling of the spirit.
From vigor to old age to death,
the spirit scatters from dissipation,
yet people do not know to rest quietly and nourish it.
Even if one sits in repose all day,
if the mind wanders outward,
the Valley will not be empty,
the spirit will not remain—
how then can one avoid death?
Only by seeking the essence in the profound darkness,
seeking things in the hazy uncertainty,
with form and spirit merging perfectly,
uniting with the Dao’s truth,
can one achieve longevity.
*Xuán* is Heaven—emptiness;
*Pìn* is Earth—stillness.
If one accumulates emptiness to communicate with the spirit,
attains stillness to nourish the true,
then the Dao of the Mysterious Female’s immortality is realized.

○ Master Li said:
*“The Valley-Spirit does not die”—
the void and spirit remain unobscured.
*The Mysterious Female*—
one Yin, one Yang.

「The Gate of the Mysterious Female,
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Master Lü said:
Since the Mysterious Female’s essence is defined by ascent and descent,
then the *Gate* refers to the doorway through which the two primal forces—Yin and Yang—
neither emerge nor vanish.

Before the *Dirt Pellet Palace* (泥丸宮) lies the *Bright Hall* (明堂),
which extends downward to the nostrils,
hence the nostrils are the *Gate of the Mysterious Female*.
The nostrils connect the Six Palaces (六府) with the passage of *qi*,
where the light and subtle *qi* interfaces with Heaven,
thus it is called the *Heavenly Root*.

Above the *Mystery of the Primordial Mother* (牝元宮) lies the *Yellow Court* (黃庭),
which ascends through the *Heavy Chamber* (重楼) to the mouth,
hence the mouth is the *Gate of the Mysterious Female*.
The mouth connects the Five Organs (五臟) with the passage of *qi*,
where the heavy and turbid *qi* interfaces with Earth,
thus it is called the *Earthly Root*.

The common folk do not exhaust its source,
nor probe its origin,
and so they merely call the nostrils *Mysterious Female* (玄)
and the mouth *Primordial Mother* (牝).
Then what else could the *Gate of the Mysterious Female* be named?
This is due to their failure to grasp its subtlety.

○ Master He said:
When emptiness is perfected and stillness is steadfastly maintained,
entering through this Gate,
the roots of Heaven and Earth are fully attained.

Heaven bestows *qi*, Earth bestows *jing* (精),
when gathered, they form spirit—
this is their root.
If the root is not plucked,
then life may endure long.
Hence it is said: *"My life lies in me, not in Heaven and Earth,"*
and again: *"I share one breath of *qi* with Heaven and Earth,
governing myself by preserving the root—this is the Way."*

○ Master Ni said:
*Mysterious Female* (玄) is the Yang—
the *Heavenly Stem* (乾).
*Primordial Mother* (牝) is the Yin—
the *Earthly Receptacle* (坤).
The *Gate* is the path of emergence and return,
the opening and closing of *Heavenly Stem* and *Earthly Receptacle*.
The *Root* is like the root of a tree—
the origin of life.

As the *Yì* (易) says:
*"The Great Polarity* (太極) *is the origin of the Two Forces* (兩儀)."
And again:
*"The *Heavenly Stem* and *Earthly Receptacle*—
these are the Gates of the *Yì*."*

○ Master Li said:
*"One closing, one opening—
generating Heaven, generating Earth."*

○ Master Liú said:
*Mysterious Female* (玄) is the Yang,
*Primordial Mother* (牝) is the Yin.
The *Gate* is the keyhole of the two *qi*—
as the previous chapter says: *"the Gate of all wonders,"*
and as the saying goes: *"Who can exit without passing through the door?
Why not follow this Way?"*

Before Heaven and Earth existed,
the *Original Breath* (元氣) was first—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

Continuous and unceasing,
it is used without exhaustion.
Master Lü said:
Continuous and unceasing—
like a thread that never breaks.
When the two *qi* of the Mysterious Female enter their root,
if the closing is too extreme, they lose it to haste;
if they are left unrestrained, they lose it to turbulence—
both are incorrect.
To achieve true continuity without interruption,
as if present yet not present,
as if absent yet not absent,
the true breath arrives at perfect equilibrium,
like the turtle’s retreat,
like the serpent’s repose—
never reaching exhaustion or urgency.

The *Zhuāngzǐ* (莊子) says:
*"The ancient true ones,
their breathing profound and deep,
breathing with the heel of their foot.*
*The *Língshū* (靈樞) of the *Inner Canon* (內經):*
*"Mingled chaos and numinous response,
ascending clouds to refine the root—
continuous and unceasing,
using it—how could it be exhausted?"*

○ Master Hé said:
Continuous and everlasting,
boundless and inexhaustible—
it seems to exist yet does not.
If it were exhausted,
then life would be labored and depleted.
The *Grand Historian* (太史公) said:
*"In all people,
the essence of life is spirit,
the vessel is form.
If spirit is overused, it will be depleted;
if form is overtaxed, it will be impaired.
When form and spirit separate, death ensues."*

○ Master Wú said:
Continuous and unceasing—
long-lasting without interruption.
*Store*—
spirit’s abiding presence.
*Exhaust*—
labor and depletion.
If *qi* is used with ease, it nurtures and grows daily;
if *qi* is used with agitation, it is consumed and depleted.
The statement that spirit endures within,
then *qi* is not exhausted.

○ Master Li said:
*"One closing, one opening—
a ceaseless flow,
no one knows its measure.
In motion and stillness, no confusion,
no strain of effort,
eternally generating and transforming."*

The *Lièzǐ* (列子) fully records this chapter,
and then says: *"The Yellow Emperor’s Book says..."*
According to the *Inner Transmission* (內傳) of *Gěxiān Gōng* (葛仙公),
when the Yellow Emperor was emperor,
the *Laozi* (老君), as *Guǎngchéngzǐ* (廣成子),
explained this scripture to him.
Thus the emperor wrote it down,
quoting this chapter as follows.

Heaven and Earth endure long,
because they can endure long.
Heaven and Earth are able to endure long
because they do not generate themselves—
thus they endure long.

○ Master Hé said:
Heaven and Earth are unified in generating things,
yet do not generate themselves.
The scripture says:
*"Generating yet not possessing,
enduring yet not controlling—
this is called the Mysterious Virtue."*
All speak of Heaven and Earth not generating themselves,
yet being able to endure long—
thus it is said:
*"Ample and profound—
thus they bear things;
High and luminous—
thus they cover things;
Endless and enduring—
thus they complete things."*
The three phrases all concern generating things,
yet do not mention Heaven and Earth generating themselves.

○ Master Li said:
Heaven does not generate Heaven,
Earth does not generate Earth—
thus life does not cease.

○ Master Lín said:
This chapter uses Heaven and Earth to illustrate
the sage’s lack of contrivance.
Heaven and Earth generate all things,
naturally and effortlessly,
without contrivance—
thus ten thousand years are like one day.

Therefore, the sage places his body last yet it is first,
places his body externally yet it endures—
not because he has no selfish desires,
but because he fulfills them.

○ Master Hé said:
The sage aligns with Heaven and Earth without boundary,
accepts the bearing and covering with selflessness,
laboring for the world.
Is it not because Heaven and Earth share the same root with me,
and all things share the same body with me?
All take what is before themselves,
but I alone take what is after—
by taking what is after, others are placed before.
All take what is solid for themselves,
but I alone take what is empty—
my form is placed externally,
while the Way is preserved within.

And again:
*"The sage takes the Dao as his body,
yet has no body—
what selfishness could there be?
This is how he harmonizes with Heaven and Earth without end."*

○ Master Wú said:
*Placing last*—
humility, abasement below.
*Placing first*—
exaltation, elevation above.
*Placing externally*—
clearing stillness, non-action.
*Enduring*—
longevity, abiding in the world.
*Selflessness*—
placing his body last, placing his body externally.
*Fulfilling selfishness*—
his body is first, his body endures.
The sage does not desire to fulfill selfishness,
yet naturally achieves the effects of his body being first and enduring.
If one were to assume that all people have contrivance to fulfill their selfishness,
then it would be possible to speak of it as such.
But the sage’s actions are not contrived.»

○ Master Lǐ said:
The sage does not claim his own sainthood,
thus he aligns with Heaven and Earth in **virtue/power** without end.

○ Master Lín said:
In the sage’s cultivation of the self,
there is no **mind of distinction** between first and last,
no **mind of distinction** between inner and outer,
thus none can surpass him yet he remains ever present.
Hence, he is without selfishness yet achieves the effects of his selfishness.
This is not the selfishness of public and private gain,
for if it were, one could not say he has no **mind of distinction**.
These words reveal Lǎozǐ’s intent to guide people toward goodness,
and when the **Release** [Buddhist schools] expound upon them,
they speak of *true emptiness, real existence*—
*true emptiness* is the meaning of **selflessness**,
*real existence* is the meaning of **achieving the effects of his selfishness**.

○ Master Héshàng Gōng said:
When people speak of selfishness,
they mean to enrich themselves.
The sage, without selfishness, enriches himself naturally,
thus achieving the effects of his selfishness.

*Chapter Eight of the Daoist Canon: The Collection of Meanings*
**上善若水** [The highest virtue is like water],
water benefits all things yet does not contend,
dwelling where people deem vile,
thus it is close to the Dao.

○ Master Lín said:
This chapter again uses water to illustrate the meaning of **no mind of distinction**.
**上善** [The highest virtue] refers to the utmost goodness in the world,
its principle being akin to water’s nature.
Water’s goodness lies in its ability to benefit all things—
yet how often does it regard itself as capable?
Following the current without resistance,
it does not contend.
Embracing the low and the moist,
it does not deem what others abhor as vile.
When observed thus, water is near the Dao.
**几** [Close], meaning **near**.

○ Master Wú said:
**上善** [The highest virtue] is the utmost extreme of virtue—
the virtue of those who follow the Dao.
Why is it like water?
Water’s virtue lies in its irrigation and cleansing,
its function of benefiting all things,
yet it does not vie for high or pure places;
instead, it dwells in the vile and lowly spots people despise,
thus it is close to the virtue of those who follow the Dao.
**几** [Close], meaning **near**.

○ Master Lǚ said:
None surpass the **highest virtue** in embodying
the mystery of **Heaven’s One** [天一],
the essence of **Dao’s One** [道一],
or fulfilling the function of **uppermost goodness**.
Water, whether square or round, solid or fluid,
conforms to its natural suitability—
this is how the sage examines the Dao,
models its goodness,
and responds to change with the times,
like water’s nature—
sometimes firm, sometimes yielding,
sometimes square, sometimes round,
neither too much nor too little,
thus it is said: **The highest virtue is like water**.
The **perfected person** [至人] unifies the Dao through One,
and One through the Dao,
so water is used to illustrate the **heart** [mind],
and the **heart** [mind] is used to craft the Dao.
Moreover, the *Shāngtóng Qì* [《参同契》] states:
**"One"** is the **pivot of the Dao** [道枢],
knowing white yet guarding black—
all interpretations by **Péng Zhēn** [彭真人] are of **One**.
Indeed, **golden elixir** [金液] and **jade elixir** [玉液]
are the **pivots of the Dao** for the **golden elixir method** [金丹之道枢],
irrigating the five **zàng organs** [五脏],
nourishing the three **tián fields** [三田],
swilling and descending with ease,
circulating and flowing without obstruction—
the *Huángtíng Jīng* [《黄庭经》] says:
*"Swilling the elixir essence, calamities do not adhere."*
Within **qi** [炁] lies **true One’s water** [真一之水],
and within water lies **true One’s qi** [真一之炁],
thus the **Flowering Pool** [华池] is the source of **uppermost goodness’s** benefits.

Dwelling in the **virtue of goodness** [善地],
the **heart** [mind] is the **virtue of depth** [善渊],
giving is the **virtue of generosity** [善仁],
speech is the **virtue of trustworthiness** [善信],
governance is the **virtue of order** [善治],
action is the **virtue of capability** [善能],
movement is the **virtue of timeliness** [善时].

○ Master Hé said:
The opening line, **"The highest virtue is like water"**,**
does not merely state that water is good;
it earnestly urges all people to emulate it,
to resemble water in possessing all these virtues of the utmost goodness.
**Like water** is **like the Dao**.
Thus, the **virtue of goodness in dwelling** is akin to water’s relation to the earth—
water flows when it meets the earth,
the earth softens when it meets water;
how could it hoard its place of dwelling?
The **virtue of goodness in the heart** is like water’s relation to the depths—
people do not reflect in flowing water,
but in still water;
how could they lose their original mind?
The **virtue of goodness in giving** is like water’s relation to the seven [orifices]—
it measures and pours for others,
how could it indulge others’ desires?
The **virtue of goodness in speech** is like water’s trustworthiness—
it rises and falls with the tides,
how could it go back on its word?
The **virtue of goodness in governance** is like water’s relation to order—
it adjusts like a balance scale,
how could it raise or lower its hand arbitrarily?
The **virtue of goodness in action** is like water’s relation to capability—
it is capable of both square and round,
how could it not exhaust all means and adapt to all changes?
The **virtue of goodness in movement** is like water’s relation to the times—
it halts when still, flows when moving,
how could it not respond to circumstances and follow natural course?

○ Master Lǐ said:
Dwelling in the **virtue of goodness** [善地] is to benefit others.
The **heart** [mind] being the **virtue of depth** [善渊] is to contain all things.
Giving as the **virtue of generosity** [善仁] is to nurture life.
Speech as the **virtue of trustworthiness** [善信] is to respond to all things.
Governance as the **virtue of order** [善治] is to transform all things.
Action as the **virtue of capability** [善能] is to accomplish all things.
Movement as the **virtue of timeliness** [善时] is to follow all things.
Only because it does not contend,
there is no blame against it.

○ Master Lín said:
The seven virtues mentioned above
all describe the goodness of those who follow the Dao,
yet they do not regard themselves as capable—
thus, in the world, they contend with none,
nor do they invite blame or resentment.
This is the meaning of:
*"Only because you do not contend,
no one in the world can contend with you."*

Many commentators take this as the **seven lesser virtues of water**,
so their explanations often strain the meaning—
not the original intent of Lǎozǐ.

○ Master Hé said:
To encompass these several virtues,
to begin with **non-contention** and end with **non-contention**,
is the utmost of goodness.
Who can emulate it?
Thus there is no blame against it.
The unvirtuous invite blame,
and even if virtuous, if they cannot avoid contention,
they too may invite blame.
But if one is both virtuous and without contention,
what blame could there be?
This is why water’s virtue resembles the Dao.

○ Master Lǐ said:
Water embodies **gentleness and harmony**,
dwelling in the low—
benefiting all things yet not contending,
thus there is no blame against it.

○ Master Wú said:
Only the **uppermost goodness** of those who follow the Dao
does not vie for high places yet willingly dwells in the low,
thus people do not blame them.
**尤** [Blame] means **resentment and censure**,
so those who desire to rise above others
cannot avoid a **mind of contention**,
and where there is contention, there is blame.

*Chapter Nine of the Daoist Canon: The Collection of Meanings*
**To hold and fill it** [持而盈之],
**is not as good as letting it be** [不如其已].
**To grasp and sharpen it** [揣而锐之],
**cannot be long preserved** [不可长保].

「Master Lín said:
This chapter speaks only of how advancement is not as good as retreat,
thus using *holding and filling* [持而盈之] and *grasping and sharpening* [揣而锐之] as metaphors.
A vessel that is filled to overflowing must spill—
to hold it is difficult,
yet it is easier to preserve what is not filled.
**已** [already/stop] means the intent of not filling it.
**揣** [grasp] means **治** [refine], **锐** [sharp] means **铦** [keen].
To refine a vessel to its utmost keenness and sharpness,
without fail it will break—
thus, it is better to preserve what is not sharpened for long.

○ Master Wú said:
**持** [hold] means to **捧** [carry].
**已** [already/stop] means to **止** [cease].
This chapter states that the Dao does not desire to be filled,
for when filled, it easily leads to overflowing—
yet it is better to cease and avoid filling.
The **锋** [edge] cannot remain sharp,
for when sharpened, it easily leads to **到** [bluntness],
and its sharpness cannot be long preserved.
To fill is also to invite the loss of what is filled—
this is the reason as well.

○ Master Liú said:
To be filled is to be bound to emptiness—
be warned against fullness.
To be sharpened is to be bound to dullness—
be warned against excess.
Gold and jade filling the hall,
no one can guard them.
Wealth and honor with arrogance,
one invites their own downfall.
When one’s achievements are complete and name established,
to retreat is the Dao of Heaven.
Master Lín said:
When wealth and honor reach the point of gold and jade filling the hall,
one cannot long preserve them.
To dwell in the rank of king or noble yet reach arrogance and fullness,
one brings upon oneself the consequences of that.
Thus, those who wish to preserve their achievements
and safeguard their reputation must know to retreat early—
only then does one align with Heaven’s Dao.
**功成** [achievements complete] and **名遂** [reputation established]
are terms that vary with greatness and smallness,
yet one can still preserve them—
hence the words *complete* and *established*.
If one does not know when to stop,
then when is it ever complete?
When is it ever established?
These four characters must be carefully examined.

○ Master Wú said:
In the world, there are those who have gold and jade filling their halls
yet cannot guard them—
why is this?
It is because wealth and honor breed arrogance,
and one invites their own downfall.
Thus, when achievements are complete and reputation established,
to retreat is in accord with Heaven’s Dao—
this is the saying of *not desiring to be filled*.
Gold and jade filling the hall means wealth,
arrogance means those who fill themselves—
their misfortune is self-inflicted, not by others.
Achievements complete and reputation established means honor,
to retreat means to not fill oneself—
Heaven’s Dao is empty yet not filled,
thus the sequence of the four seasons.
Those who achieve success depart.

○ Master Lǐ said:
Achievements complete and reputation established,
yet one retreats—
this is the warning against excess and the encouragement of humility.

○ Master Lǚ said:
*The Book of Changes* says:
*"To know advancement and retreat, survival and perishing,
yet never lose one’s true path—
who but the Sage can do so?"*
Lù Xīshēng said:
To carry a great vessel and be filled to overflowing,
even if one fears it, it is better to cease early.
To occupy a high position and be extreme in one’s conduct,
even if one worries, it is better to withdraw early.
As for following the wanderings of the Red Pine [赤松],
or drifting away in a small boat [扁舟],
this also clearly shows the meaning of *not desiring to be filled*.

○ Master Liú said:
Gold and jade must accumulate—
be warned against greed.
Wealth and honor must lead to licentiousness—
be warned against pride.
Achievements complete and reputation established must bring danger—
be warned against not knowing when to stop.
The words of the Master Lǎo are deeply meant to save people—
not saying that those who abandon worldly affairs and dwell in the mountains and forests
can enter the Dao.
Even while residing in the realm of wealth, honor, achievements, and reputation,
all can be diligently practiced.

**Chapter Ten**
To carry the **魂** [hun/soul] and embrace the **一** [One],
can one avoid separation?
To focus **炁** [qi] and attain **柔** [gentleness],
can one be like an infant?
○ Master Hé said:
To embrace the One without separation,
the child can guard the One,
and the One also guards the child.
To focus **炁** [qi] and attain **柔** [gentleness],
to be like an infant—
the scripture says: *"The depth of virtue is compared to an infant,
bones weak, sinews soft, yet grip firm."*
To focus **炁** [qi] is to preserve **纯气** [pure qi].
To attain **柔** [gentleness] is to reach **至和** [ultimate harmony] without deviation.
This is how the Great Person never loses the heart of an infant.

○ Master Lín said:
**载** [carry] is like a cart carrying goods.
An infant has not yet encountered sights or sounds,
thus its **炁** [qi] is focused.
**致** [attain] means **极** [to reach the utmost],
**柔** [gentleness] means **顺** [to comply].
If one can be like an infant in focusing **炁** [qi] and attaining gentleness,
then one can embrace the One.
Hence it is said: *"To focus qi and attain gentleness,
can one be like an infant?"*
This is the Master Lǎo’s rhetorical question.
It means: *"Can people truly do this?"*
The following sentences are all in this vein.

○ Master Lǚ said:
A strong **魂** [hun/soul] is the companion of life,
a robust **魄** [pò/soul] is the companion of death.
The **魂** [hun/soul], belonging to **阳** [yang], delights in clarity and emptiness,
while the **魄** [pò/soul], belonging to **阴** [yin], thrives in agitation and disturbance.
The **魄** [pò/soul] is the **阳** [yang]'s thief,
and moreover, the nature of the **魄** [pò/soul] is to:
indulge people in sensory pleasures,
pursue superficial splendor,
be lost in drowsiness and slumber,
and roam freely—
draining one’s vital essence and **精气** [jing-qi],
leading people to perish,
so that after the body decays,
it may enjoy their sacrifices.
Thus, the Sage governs **神** [spirit] with **炁** [qi],
and restrains **魄** [pò/soul] with the form,
following the method of Earth’s use—
settled, tranquil, and deeply rooted,
steadfast and unmoving.
Though the **阴魄** [yin-pò/soul] may desire to agitate,
stirring one’s thoughts and worries,
can it truly succeed?
Hence it is said: *"To carry the魄 [pò/soul]."*
The original method of carrying it
is to embrace the One without separation.
To embrace the One is like a mirror containing clarity—
how could clarity ever separate from the mirror?
Yet one fears that the carrying may not be thorough,
so though pure and unchanging,
it is called *not two*—
only then can the spirit be complete and unharmed,
the essence be used without depletion,
and never for an instant be separated.
Hence it is said: *"To embrace the One,
can one avoid separation?"*
Moreover, if the spirit is not governed,
the qi will be disordered;
if the spirit is governed,
the qi will not act recklessly.

The Perfect Person excels in regulation and control,
focused on sincerity and purity.
They nourish it with **虚** [emptiness],
and rest it with **踵** [retreat].
Pure, refined, and gentle,
their cultivation of **炁** [qi] is like that of the **灵龟** [spiritual tortoise],
and their nurturing of the spirit is like that of an infant.
An infant embodies the depth of virtue,
dwelling in ignorance of what to do,
moving without knowing where to go—
hence it is said: *"To focus qi and attain gentleness,
can one be like an infant?"*

○ Master Lǐ said:
To carry the **魄** [pò/soul] is like the metaphor of a cart carrying goods.
The **魄** [pò/soul] loves movement,
loves to roam freely,
loves sharpness and vigor—
thus it is called *campaigning魄 [pò/soul]*.
The **魄** [pò/soul] belongs to yin;
when yin is excessive, it harms yang,
and when emotions are excessive, they enslave the nature.
Those who can subdue and restrain it
embrace the One without separation,
attain gentleness without flaw,
and practice *non-action as the female*—
non-knowing makes the yin **魄** [pò/soul] unable to indulge its emotions.
When the **魄** [pò/soul] is subdued and yin is consumed,
the spirit becomes serene and the nature tranquil.»

---

Without constraint, it moves naturally of its own accord,
like returning with treasure-laden hands—
from embracing the One downward,
purely the meaning of carrying the **pò/soul**.

To purify and remove the **玄鉴** [xuánjiàn/mysterious mirror],
can one be without flaw?

○ Master Hé said:
When Guān Yīn Zǐ knows the heart is without substance,
then he knows all things are without substance.
When he knows all things are without substance,
then he knows the Dao is without substance—
thus he does not revere words of mysterious profundity.
Those who ponder mysterious profundity only harm their spirit.
This speaks of washing away the **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision],
removing the heart’s blemishes,
thus attaining flawlessness.

○ Master Lǚ said:
Not being swayed by the **pò/soul**,
internally not being controlled by **qi**,
cleansing all thoughts and discarding all desires—
this is called **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision].
The **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] observes its subtlety,
yet it is not what the eyes can see.
Excluding the utmost truth,
all else is screened away—
exterior and interior, hollow and clear,
naturally empty and resonant.
The spiritual repository is serene and still—
only then can one attain **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision].
Once **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] is attained,
it becomes an obstacle to **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] itself—
when **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] is removed,
then there is no flaw.

○ Master Lǐ said:
Seeing nothing, hearing nothing—
dust cleansed, the mirror bright.

○ Master Dòng said:
If the vision of mysterious profundity is not removed,
it is like untying bonds.
If traces of purification remain,
it is like an obstacle to awakening.
When there is no flaw,
the love of dharma fades and duality is extinguished.

To love the nation and govern the people—
can one practice non-action?

○ Master Hé said:
The Yellow Emperor’s writings on enriching the nation and securing the people
are methods of refining **qi**.
The Sage takes the body as the nation,
the heart as the ruler,
**精氣** [jīngqì/essence-qi] as the people—
when the people are at ease, the nation prospers;
when the people scatter, the nation weakens.
When the heart practices non-action, **qi** harmonizes—
when **qi** harmonizes, all treasures gather.
When the heart acts, **qi** becomes disordered—
when **qi** is disordered, brilliance disperses.

○ Master Lǚ said:
The perfected one governs the body
just as one governs a nation—
loving the people is how one secures the nation,
loving **qi** is how one preserves the body.
Those who love the body well
take the heart as ruler,
blood as ministers,
**qi** as the people.
Unifying nature, nurturing **qi**,
filling every passage,
treasuring and regulating it,
letting it flow naturally—
then what need is there for action?

Governing the nation and the body—
their principles are one and the same.

○ Master Lǐ said:
Unmoving, unshaken—
the Dao flourishes, the times are clear.

The opening and closing of the **天門** [tiānmén/Heaven’s Gate],
can one avoid being **雌** [cí/female]?

○ Master Hé said:
*Zhuangzi* says: *"There is an exit and an entrance,
entering and exiting without seeing its form—
this is called the Heaven’s Gate."*
It also says: *"If the heart rejects this,
the Heaven’s Gate will not open."*
This speaks of the Heaven’s Gate as the **玄門** [xuánmén/mysterious gate].
The transformation of opening and closing—
guarding stillness, guarding softness—
is to guard **雌** [cí/female].
○ Master Lín said:
The Heaven’s Gate is the natural principle between Heaven and Earth.
○ Master Niè said:
The Heaven’s Gate is **乾** [qián/Heaven],
*Yijing* calls it the "door"—
where there is opening, there must be closing,
opening and closing mutually functioning.

Some say: *"能無雌"* [néng wú cí/can one avoid being female]
should be *"能為雌"* [néng wéi cí/can one be female],
yet following the context above—*"能無雌乎"* [néng wú cí hū/can one avoid being female]—
it means one does not desire flaws.
To say *"能無為乎"* [néng wú wéi hū/can one practice non-action]
is to say one does not desire action.
Now to say *"能無雌"* [néng wú cí/can one avoid being female]
is to say one does not desire **雌** [cí/female].
Laozi values softness above all—
yet to say *"無雌"* [wú cí/avoid being female]
is to unify in **雌** [cí/female] while having no **雄** [xióng/male],
meaning one can close but cannot open—
this is not the Heaven’s Gate.
Thus, the meaning of *"無雌"* [wú cí/avoid being female]
is to supplement yin with yang.

Some manuscripts say *"能為雌"* [néng wéi cí/can one be female],
but only Master Niè says *"能無雌"* [néng wú cí/can one avoid being female].
Yet judging from the context above and below,
*"無雌"* [wú cí/avoid being female] aligns more smoothly with the meaning.
Some say: *"雌"* [cí/female] is stillness without stagnation—
thus *"無雌"* [wú cí/avoid being female].
Others say: *"無雌"* [wú cí/avoid being female] means
no yin perversity to intervene—
this also makes sense.

Clear and open in all directions—
can one avoid knowing?

○ Master Hé said:
Clear and open in all directions—
this is awakening, this is illumination.
If one can be as if without knowing,
then one awakens yet does not illuminate,
sees yet remains constantly still—
this is what is called *"無知"* [wú zhī/avoid knowing] as true knowing.

○ Master Lǚ said:
By nature, Heaven is luminous and transparent,
its light extending to the four horizons,
illuminating the eight extremes.
Substantial yet appearing empty,
present yet appearing absent—
its wisdom encompasses all things,
yet returns wisdom to foolishness,
its brightness surpasses the three luminaries,
yet returns to darkness.
Making people act daily without knowing—
thus it is said: *"明四達"* [míng sì dá/clear and open in all directions],
can one avoid knowing?

○ Master Lín said:
Clear and open in all directions—
omniscient, yet taking *"無知"* [wú zhī/avoid knowing] as knowing,
then one can embrace the One.

○ Master Lǐ said:
Excluding sharpness, screening out wisdom,
harmonizing light with dust.

To nurture and store life—
to give birth without possessing,
to act without relying,
to grow without dominating—
this is called **玄德** [xuándé/mysterious virtue].

○ Master Hé said:
If one does not act in two ways toward things,
then one’s ability to give birth to things is unfathomable.
The Sage models himself after Heaven and Earth,
loving and nurturing all things—
to give birth is the Dao,
to store is virtue.
Though giving birth and not giving birth are the same,
though acting and not acting are the same,
though being an instrument of growth and not growing are the same—
the utmost emptiness, the extreme of stillness,
the mysterious virtue of Heaven—
how could one cling to, rely on, or dominate,
and burden the wondrous virtue of the mysterious?

○ Master Lǐ said:
To nurture and store life,
without possessing, without relying, without dominating—
this is to forget one’s own origins.

○ Master Wú said:
To give birth—
though one gives birth, in truth there is no mind in giving birth,
thus it is said: *"不有"* [bù yǒu/not possessing].
To store—
though one acts, in truth there is no mind in acting,
thus it is said: *"不恃"* [bù shì/not relying].
Like an official in charge—
though one governs the people, in truth there is no mind in governing,
thus it is said: *"不宰"* [bù zǎi/not dominating].
This is how one attains the mysterious and unfathomable virtue.

○ Master Lín said:
To nurture and store life—
this speaks of the transformations between creation and nurturing all things.
Creation and nurturing never rely on this as having,
never rely on this as ability—
though one is the longest of all things,
one never has the mind to dominate all things.
Only then can it be called the mysterious and profound virtue.
The intent of this chapter
largely centers on *"無為而為"* [wú wéi ér wéi/non-action as action],
natural and effortless.

**Chapter Eleven**
Thirty spokes converge to form a single hub,
yet when the space between them is empty,
the use of the wheel arises.
Mold clay into a vessel,
yet when the space within it is empty,
the use of the vessel arises.
Pierce doors and windows to make a room,
yet when the space within it is empty,
the use of the room arises.
Thus, having is for utility,
but emptiness is for function.

Master Lǐ said:
When spokes converge with the hub,
it is for the wheel’s practical utility—
this is like gathering all dharmas into the mind,
and the wondrous completeness of the spirit.
Without spokes converging with the hub,
how could it be called a wheel?
Without dharmas converging with the mind,
there is no way for the spirit to pass through.
The hub is hollow within,
so the wheel can move and run.
The mind is hollow within,
so the spirit can transform and adapt.
Thus, emptiness is the true utility,
and utility is the empty function.
Emptiness and utility interpenetrate,
free from obstruction in coming and going—
this is the essence of the previous chapter’s teaching on storing and nurturing the vital essence.
When there is nothing to store,
spokes and hub are both forgotten,
and the wheel returns to non-being—
just as when mind and dharmas are both forgotten,
the spirit returns to emptiness.
The same principle applies to vessels and rooms.

Master Wú said:
Spokes are the rims of the wheel,
the hub is its center,
and emptiness refers to the hollow space within.
*Cao* (埏) means blending clay,
and *zhi* (埴) is the sticky portion of clay.
Having this wheel, this vessel, this room—
all are for the benefit of the world,
so it is said: *"having is for utility."*
Wheels, vessels, and rooms all rely on their inner emptiness for function,
so it is said: *"emptiness is for utility."*
A person’s solid body contains *qi*,
which sustains life—this is called *"utility."*
A hollow mind contains nothing,
yet it is the source of *qi*—this is called *"utility."*
Thus, these two aspects are used as analogies.

Master Lín said:
All three are metaphors—
emptiness is their function,
while wheels, vessels, and rooms are solid utilities.
Yet the very reason they become wheels, vessels, or rooms
lies in their emptiness within.
This metaphor vividly illustrates the character *"wu"* (無),
a stroke of ingenious insight.

Master Lǚ said:
The wheel moves because of its emptiness,
the vessel holds because of its emptiness,
and the room is spacious because of its emptiness.
By elaborating on these three aspects,
it is valued to use things as analogies for oneself.
To preserve what is, one must rely on vessels,
but to preserve what is not, one must rely on the Dao.
The perfected one assumes the form of what is
while refining the spirit of what is not.
Without what is, there is no way to apply its utility,
without what is not, there is no way to achieve its function.
The form is for preserving life’s utility,
while emptiness is for attaining the spirit’s function.
Action is for the utility of things,
non-action is for the utility of function.

Master Hé said:
What is solid cannot be used by what is solid—
this refers to the form.
Yet the form is used by emptiness—
this refers to the spirit.
The hub, with its single hollow aperture,
moves the multitude of thirty spokes—
is it the wheel itself that is the wheel?
No, it is the wheel’s emptiness that makes it a wheel.
Clay is shaped into a vessel,
but if not fired, it quickly decays.
The vessel is indeed formed by blending clay,
yet if its interior is not hollow,
where will things be received?
Is it the vessel itself that is the vessel?
No, it is the vessel’s emptiness that makes it a vessel.
Even if a palace is beautiful,
sealed with walls and barriers,
what use is it?
To enter the hall, one must pass through the door—
is it the room itself that is the room?
No, it is the room’s emptiness that makes it a room.
The body is like a thing,
just as the wheel, vessel, and room are mere physical implements.
The Dao and the mind are like the hub and the window,
possessing the wondrous clarity of spirit.
The *Yì* says:
*"What is above form is called the Dao,
what is below form is called the instrument."*
It is not merely that the Dao precedes instruments,
for even within a single instrument,
the Dao inherently resides.
When people see the instrument’s solid existence,
I see the Dao’s wondrous emptiness—
then, in the midst of boundless utility and empty passage,
there is something that transcends the instrument itself.

**Chapter Twelve**
The five colors blind the eyes,
the five tones deaf the ears,
the five flavors dull the palate,
galloping and hunting make the heart mad,
rare treasures obstruct moral conduct.
Master Lǐ said:
This follows upon the previous chapter’s teaching on empty utility—
when one empties utility, one is not dazzled by sounds and colors.
Thus, the five colors blind the eyes,
for colors and sounds, flavors and things
are all *root-dusts* (根尘),
and all worldly people fall victim to their theft.
Only those who follow the Dao do not succumb to deception,
for they act only when it is proper—
then the six thieves become the six passages.

Master Lín said:
*"Blind the eyes"* means to be confused by sight,
*"deaf the ears"* means to be confused by hearing,
*"dull the palate"* means to lose the true taste,
*"make the heart mad"* means instability,
and *"obstruct moral conduct"* means hindering virtue.
These five aspects all involve indulging in externals
while losing the essence of the inner self.

Master Lǚ said:
Gazing at colors, listening to tones, tasting flavors—
all are burdens upon true nature.
Even before an infant knows its own desires,
what is sound or color,
what is flavor or taste?
But once the senses open,
it knows of green and black hues,
of the splendor of brocade and embroidery,
and chases after things in competition,
unable to penetrate the sight of colorless color.
What difference is there between this and blindness?
True sight is not merely external vision,
seeing only what is singular—
only the perfected one examines the eyes,
for they are the sun and moon of *Taiyi* (太乙).
In the midst of stillness and emptiness,
one can gather sight and turn the gaze inward,
with spirit-light radiant and clear—
even in the deepest darkness,
one alone sees the dawn.
How could this be blindness to the five colors?

What are the five tones?
They are *gong, shang, jue, zhi, yu* (宮商角徵羽),
the sounds of Zheng and Wei music,
which make people indulge in pleasure,
disturb their true nature,
and impair their spiritual clarity.
Unable to return to the hearing of soundless sound,
what difference is there between this and deafness?
True hearing is not merely external listening,
but attaining harmony within.
Only the sage discerns the ears,
for they are the *listening gates* of the Celestial Sovereign.
In profound stillness,
one listens with *qi*—
then the celestial resonances hum,
and the celestial melodies echo,
sometimes like the sound of gold and jade,
sometimes like the music of zither and strings.
Once this sound is heard,
even if external winds shake the seas
or thunder splits the mountains,
one does not hear them—
how could this be deafness to the five tones?

The five flavors—what are they? Sour, bitter, sweet, salty, and spicy.

Boiling the *lin* and butchering the *feng*,
feasting on dishes the size of a *fangzhang*,
exhausting extravagance to its utmost—
this makes the tongue indulge in cravings without end,
clouding the spirit and defiling the true self.
Unable to taste the flavorless flavor within,
what difference is there between this and *cang*?

*Cang* is loss—
to taste within is not to crave those external flavors,
but to taste one’s own essence alone.

Only the Perfect One knows the mouth,
for it is the crimson well of the Vermilion Palace.
Thus, they nourish the *hángxiè*,
consume the *yuying*,
drink the *jinyè*,
and sip the *qiánlí*,
to irrigate their celestial root.

Therefore it is said:
*"Plain and flavorless—heaven’s and humanity’s sustenance."*
When the *Zi Dan* presents his dishes—
*yellow* as the *langgāo* and *yùshuāng*—
how could the delicacies of *gāoliáng* ever surpass this?

Hunting is the common practice of the state:
spring searches, summer patrols, autumn hunts, winter expeditions—
never missing its season.

But to indulge in endless revelry,
to pursue ruinous excess,
day and night without rest—
how could one not drown their true nature in deceit?

The Perfect One’s inner heart is serene and unmoved,
cutting off the harm of sounds and profits,
not indulging their nature,
not flaunting their virtue—
*Taiyi* is clear and tranquil,
where could wild emotions arise?

Ah! The *zhàochéng* pearl,
the *liánchéng* jade—
the world’s treasures,
the people’s prized possessions.
If one demands them without restraint,
exceeding their due,
a single misstep
will cause all their conduct to fade and vanish.

The Perfect One regards all things as *chányì*,
sees *Sōngyue* as a mere blemish,
untainted by desire,
self-soaring in the Dao—
even rare treasures could never obstruct their path.

---
*He Shi* says:
*"In the* Zhuangzi*, five colors blind the eyes,
making vision unclear;
five tones deafen the ears,
making hearing dull;
five flavors corrupt the mouth,
making taste* cang.
*Rushing and retreating unsettle the heart,
making nature soar wildly—
this sentiment aligns with this chapter.*

Once there was a man who loved hunting,
claiming it made one forget death—
was this not the madness of the heart?

There was a man who, at dawn, rushed to the market to seize gold.
When the pursuers questioned him,
he said: *"When taking the gold,
I saw only gold,
not people."*
Is this not a treasure that obstructs one’s path?

The chapter’s use of *order* and the *Zhuangzi*’s *make* both describe
how when things grow heavy, the will grows light;
how deep enticement leads to shallow gain—
unaware, enslaved by others,
losing one’s sovereignty.
People do not know the Dao,
and thus fall to this.

*Cang* is *difference*—loss, not *brightness*.

---
*Zhào Shi* says:
If one does not indulge in the pleasures of ears and eyes,
nor the delights of mouth and stomach,
and does not seek gain—
then naturally, there will be no loss.
Thus, the sage nourishes the *fù* rather than the *mù*,
and so discards the former to take the latter.

*Lǐ Shi* says:
To nourish the *fù* rather than the *mù*—
the inner realm does not stray,
the outer realm does not intrude—
retracting sight, returning hearing.

---
*Lín Shi* says:
The *fù* is the inner self,
the *mù* is the outer.
The sage attends to the inner and not the outer,
thus it is said: *discard the former, take the latter.*
The former refers to the five above,
the latter, the Dao.

---
*Lǚ Shi* says:
*Kūn* is the *fù*, bearing all things,
*Lí* is the *mù*, gazing outward.
The *fù* has capacity,
receiving within to nourish its substance.
When *Dao-qi* is full and surging,
the inner self is whole in spirit.

The *mù* perceives the outer,
fixating on all colors,
disturbing the true dwelling.
Thus, the sage cultivates the inner,
not the outer,
seeking within rather than without.

Retracting sight, returning hearing—
restoring the command, returning to origin—
discarding the spirit of the *mù*,
taking the essence of the *fù*—
thus it is said: *discard the former, take the latter.*

---
*He Shi* says:
To indulge the emotions exhausts the spirit,
to adorn the outer harms the inner.
Thus, to nourish the *fù* is to focus solely on the inner,
while to indulge the *mù* is to let the outer dominate—
the eyes see, the heart moves.
Many things can lure one away,
but if forgotten by the *mù*, light overflows without bound.
If the *fù* is filled, there is a master within.
To take this is the Dao;
to discard that is the world.

**Chapter Thirteen**
*Honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks,*
*great calamities are like threats to one’s life.*

*Lǚ Shi* says:
Honors and humiliations are the natural course of gain and loss,
while the *yòushēn* is the greatest calamity to true nature.
Honor is followed by humiliation,
humiliation arises from honor.

Fine titles and rich emoluments,
silk robes and jade food—
these are indeed grounds for honor,
yet when they come, one rejoices,
when they depart, one grieves,
and humiliations abound—
how could this not be shocking?
Thus it is said: *honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks.*

The body is not inherently noble;
what is noble is *xìng* and *mìng*.
Humanity is not inherently plagued by calamity;
what is calamitious is *dé* and *shī*.
Thus, in life,
one stumbles upon cold and heat,
entangles in right and wrong,
is constrained by fear and urgency,
struggles in advance and retreat.
If one only worries over gains and losses from external things,
it is as if one abandons the calamities of true nature upon the body—
thus it is said: *great calamities are like threats to one’s life.*

---
*Wú Shi* says:
*Noble* means *weighty*—
wealth and riches are considered great benefits,
yet in truth, they are great calamities.
Thus, those who know the Dao do not prize them,
while those who prize them are ensnared by them—
*ensnared* meaning unable to extricate themselves,
and thus burdened by them.

What is meant by *honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks*?
Honor is lowly—
to receive it is shocking,
to lose it is shocking—
this is called *honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks.*

*Lǚ Shi* says:
What are honors and humiliations?
Are they not the sway of kin and authority,
bending the body and lowering the head,
refining speech and waiting for opportunity,
hoping for praise and elevation,
spirit and breath in harmony,
nursing the remnants of wine,
listening and obeying—
this is called *honor*?

Once honor is received,
one is placed among those who serve,
always fearing its loss—
how could one not be its subordinate?
Thus it is said: *honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks*—
honor is lowly.

Yet honor is the root of humiliation, and fortune the seed of calamity.
When honor descends upon one,
it comes with lofty carriages and four steeds,
towering halls and carved walls,
jades at the girdle and chimes at the belt,
rank elevated to its utmost,
favor extending to one’s descendants—
nothing is withheld.
Once obtained, one rejoices as if struck by shock.

When humiliation arrives,
suddenly grace wanes and favor fades,
slander spreads like seeping moisture,
morning whispers turn to evening dismissal,
deep blame and heavy punishment follow—
calamity comes without turning back.
One loses it abruptly, trembling as if struck by shock.
Thus, one honor and one humiliation,
like shadow following form,
both are causes for shock.

Only the Sage is not enslaved by form.
He regards honor as humiliation,
flees fame and abandons the world,
preserves his body and avoids harm,
equalizes praise and blame,
unifies life and death,
does not scheme externally,
does not fret internally,
does not indulge his will in high rank,
does not conform to vulgarity in poverty.
Looking back on gains and losses of honor and humiliation—
how could they shock him?

**He Shi says:**
What is meant by *honor and humiliation*?
Honor is lowly—
for when fame arises, slander follows—
this is called lowly.
High office brings danger—
this too is lowly.
Honor itself is lowly;
to obtain it is to lose—
for one knows its lowliness without waiting for humiliation.

**Lin Shi says:**
This is the meaning of *fearing gain and fearing loss*.

What is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?
The reason I have great calamity
is that I have a body.
But when I have no body,
what calamity do I have?
**Lü Shi says:**
What the world values as *treating great calamity as one’s own body*
is this: when a person is born,
he shares the same root as Heaven and Earth,
and all things draw sustenance from it.
The petty man pursues profit,
the scholar pursues fame—
though their power and influence differ,
to have a body makes them one in this regard.
The world says that without a body, there is no calamity—
this is to lose the Master’s intent.

How could the Perfect Man’s *great calamity of having a body*
mean abandoning form and losing his physical self,
sinking into dull emptiness?
It means he is ensnared by things and fixated on self,
not embodying the Dao.

Thus, his heart is like dead ashes,
his form like withered wood—
though honored, he is not humiliated;
though humiliated, he has no calamity.
He transcends his body as if it were not his,
forgets his mind as if it were not his,
discards illusion and attains the eternal truth,
abandons awareness and sits in forgetfulness.
Then the jade talisman preserves his spirit,
the golden elixir refines his form—
form and spirit both attain marvelous harmony,
merging with the Dao’s true essence.
No longer afflicted by having a body,
how could he suffer great calamity?

**He Shi says:**
What is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?
*Noble* means *weighty*—
the body is a great calamity,
worthy of weighty regard, not to be treated lightly.
The body is small, yet the calamity is great;
when the body is forgotten, calamity ceases—
this is clear.
Thus it is said:
Ears and eyes, sounds and colors—
these are the child’s lingering debts.
The nose and mouth crave fragrance and flavor—
these are sources of resentment.
The body is the root of vexation:
pain, itching, cold, heat—
because I am bound to the body, I know great calamity.
Yet once formed, I cannot suddenly make it cease to be a source of calamity—
what benefit is there?
The Sage summarizes this in one phrase:
*Transcend the body while the body exists.*
Why not consider that form is not mine to possess,
that name is not mine to retain?
What I am born from
comes from the natural void—
structured by *qi* and taking shape.
Thus, though I receive form,
the form is not mine.
Form is lent to me as form,
shown to me as appearance.
Therefore, those who attain the Dao
transcend the physical frame to conquer themselves,
transforming their essence and cultivating purity,
diligently practicing the Dao of boundless formlessness—
then what others fear,
I have no fear of.

Moreover, the body is indeed the root of calamity,
yet having a body means having things—
this is what invites calamity.
**Liezi said:**
*The body is not mine to possess.*
Though born, I must preserve it—
things are not mine to possess,
though I have them, I must abandon them.
The body is the master of life,
things are the master of nourishment—
though I preserve my body,
I cannot possess it;
though I do not abandon things,
I cannot possess them.
To possess things and the body
is to arrogantly claim Heaven’s body and Heaven’s things—
how could such a one be a Sage?

To make Heaven’s body and Heaven’s things public—
this means not claiming them as one’s own,
but offering them to the world—
then the body can be forgotten,
and calamity can be forgotten.

Thus, to honor the body as the world’s
is to entrust it to the world.
To love the body as the world’s
is to commit it to the world.
**Wu Shi says:**
The Son of Heaven’s eminence,
the wealth of the Four Seas—
all stem from treating the body as the world’s.
Those who know the Dao
cherish and treasure this body,
not daring to use it for the world’s sake,
preferring to have no world rather than lightly use their body.
Only thus can they be entrusted with the world.
*Entrust* is like entrusting a command over a hundred *li*;
*commit* is like committing a six-foot orphan.
Shun and Yu held the world yet did not possess it—
thus the succession of Tang and Yu.
Those who take honor and humiliation as glory,
who value great calamity as great profit—
these are vulgar men.
How could one entrust the world to them?

**He Shi says:**
If one values and loves this body more than the world itself,
such a person will not be moved by the world,
and thus can be entrusted with its care.
*The Zhuangzi* says:
*The true Dao governs the body;
its coarse husk governs the world.*
Yet today’s common scholars
often endanger their bodies and abandon life for things—
is this not tragic?
This is like the parable of the *hidden pearl used to strike a sparrow.*

**Lin Shi says:**
The words *entrust* and *commit*
imply the world is not possessed.

**Dong Shi says:**
This chapter clarifies the abandonment of false emotions
and restores true nature.
It says:
Abandon honor, and humiliation will not reach you;
forget the body, and calamity will not come.
The world is a great thing—
yet it is not a burden.
What of lesser things?

**Chapter Fourteen.**

The unseen is called *yí* (平),
the unheard is called *xī* (希),
the untouchable is called *wēi* (微).
These three cannot be grasped or questioned,
thus they merge into one.

**Lin Shi says:**
This chapter describes the Dao’s unapproachable nature.
*Yí* means level—flat, without trace, hence unseen.
*Xī* and *wēi* imply what is faint and invisible.
The three terms, though distinct in name,
all depict the Dao’s inability to be heard, seen, or seized.
*Bó* means "to grasp."
These three—*yí, xī, wēi*—
though named, cannot be distinguished,
for they are all the Dao itself.

**Wu Shi says:**
*Yí* means level and flat—
level, it vanishes without trace, hence unseen.
*Xī* means sparse—
sparse, it leaves gaps with no sound, hence unheard.
*Wēi* means faint—
faint, it is dim and boundless, hence untouchable.
Though one might strive to describe *yí, xī, wēi*,
the words fail—
thus they merge indistinguishably into one.

**Lü Shi says:**
The colorless color—
even if Zhīzhū or Zhīyǔ sharpened their eyes at noon,
rubbed their brows, and strained to gaze,
they would see nothing.
The soundless sound—
even if Zhīyú or Shīguāng cupped their ears at night,
leaned forward, and listened intently,
they would hear nothing.
The shapeless form—
even if Guìyù or Wǔdīng strained their strength,
clenched their fists, and lunged with all their might,
they could not grasp it.
Eyes find no light to illuminate,
ears find no sound to perceive,
hands find no form to seize—
thus it is called *yí*, *xī*, *wēi*.
Though named differently,
in essence, they are one.
Like all sounds merging into one wind yet differing in tone,
or seven orifices sharing the same *qi* yet serving distinct functions—
these three cannot be grasped or questioned,
thus they merge into one.
Yet when considered together,
they blend seamlessly as one,
so that though sight, hearing, and touch are applied,
they remain indistinguishable.

Its upper reaches are not bright,
its lower depths are not dark.
Endless and nameless,
it returns to nothing—
this is called the form of no-form,
the image of no-image—
this is called *hūhuǎng* (惚恍).

**Lin Shi says:**
"Not bright" means not illuminated,
"Not dark" means not obscured.
"Upper" and "lower" are not to be confined—
only that this Dao is neither seen above nor below.
*Shéngshéng* (绳绳) means "prolific."
Prolific yet nameless,
its end returns to nothing—
thus it is the form of no-form,
the image of no-image—
also *hūhuǎng*.

**Wu Shi says:**
"Upper" and "lower" refer to what the *Yijing* calls
"form above form" and "form below form."
*Shéngshéng* means "continuous without interruption."
*Fù* means "to return."
"Without substance" refers to the Dao—
returning to its origin,
it aligns with the Dao of nothingness,
as in *Zhuangzi*’s "virtue reaching back to its beginning."
The Dao has no substance,
yet its form and image are not like those of things—
thus "form of no-form," "image of no-image."
It seems both present and absent—
hence *hūhuǎng*.

**Lü Shi says:**
All shaped and colored things have limits,
but the Dao precedes Heaven and Earth,
endures from ancient to modern times.
It disperses as *chōngqì* (冲气),
spreads as the *tàixū* (太虚),
coexists with the Two Principles (yin-yang),
yet its brilliance does not dazzle—
suddenly, it rests beneath the nine depths,
hidden like tiles and rubble,
yet its obscurity is not dim.
It cycles endlessly, unbroken,
continuous without end,
nameless, untraceable,
its virtue complete yet unseen.
Though one might try to liken it to things,
it cannot be—
thus "its upper reaches are not bright,
its lower depths are not dark."
Endless and nameless,
it returns to nothing—
vast yet solemn,
deep yet unfathomable,
beyond comparison or measure.
Within the formless,
there is the form of no-form;
within the nothing,
there is the image of no-image.
If one says it has form,
what form does it truly have?
If one says it lacks image,
what image does it truly lack?
Thus it is said:
Mysterious presence without presence,
true absence without absence—
*hūhuǎng*, ethereal and misty,
indeterminate between presence and absence—
hence "form of no-form," "image of no-image," *hūhuǎng*.

Approach it, and you see no head;
follow it, and you see no tail.
Hold fast to the ancient Dao
to govern the present.

「To know the ancient beginning is called *Dao*’s principle.

Lin Shi says: To approach it and see no head is its beginningless nature. To follow it and see no tail is its endless nature. To hold fast to the ancient *Dao* is to speak of its emergence from nothingness. By grasping its original nothingness to govern the present, one may then comprehend the *Dao* of the ancient beginning.

*Ji* means "principle and order." *Dao ji* is akin to "human principle," or the fundamental *Way* of kingship.

○ Wu Shi says: Because it is *hūhuǎng* and indeterminate, neither approaching nor following can reveal its limits. The ancient is what precedes, the present is what follows. All things originate from the *Dao*, hence "to hold fast to the ancient *Dao* to govern the present."

The ancient beginning is the *Dao*.

○ He Shi says: From "to hold fast to the ancient *Dao*" onward, this passage exhausts the theme of "no beginning, no end," yet introduces the character "have" (*you*), thereby showing that though myriad transformations differ, one may govern all by holding fast to the One. The *Dao* governs and the king rules—great measures are not severed—all rooted in the ultimate *wu* (nothingness).

The Classic says: "Hold fast to the great image, and all under heaven will follow." Indeed, one cannot govern *you* (having) without *wu* (nothingness) governing it. The "holding" is to take this and proceed.

*Beginning of Volume Three of the Collected Meanings of the Dao-De Jing*」

**Chapter Fifteen of the *Jade Decisions of the Wu River*: The Ancient Virtuous Scholar**

The ancient virtuous scholar was subtle, mysterious, and profound—so deep as to be unknowable.
Only because he was unknowable did he feign outward forms.

○ **Master Wu** says: *"Scholar"* refers to one who embodies the *Dao*. *"Edging through"* means *communing*—one who penetrates the mysteries of all things is without limit in his profundity. Subtle yet not manifest, his communion is profound and hard to discern, like the depths of water beyond measure. His depths are unfathomable, so he feigns outward semblances to show others. The seven descriptions below are these.

○ **Master Lin** says: This chapter depicts the virtuous scholar, profound in the *Dao*, yet beyond all recognition. His heart is empty, unknowing—his outward bearing arises from no contrivance, hence *"feigning outward forms."* From *"joyous as"* onward, this is the true depiction of the virtuous one’s bearing—most refined.

○ **Master He** says: The scholar’s *Dao* is subtle and mysterious, elusive and unobstructed—who could fathom it? Since it lies beyond perception, even naming it is a forced analogy, hence the comparisons below.

Joyous as one crossing a river in winter,
Hesitant as one fearing four neighbors,
Solemn as a guest,
Dissolving as ice about to thaw,
Thick as uncarved wood,
Vast as a valley,
Muddled as turbid water.

○ **Master Wu** says: *"Joyous"* and *"hesitant"* are names of beasts—*"joyous"* belongs to the elephant clan, *"hesitant"* to the puppy. The elephant knows ahead but moves cautiously; the puppy follows then turns back, hence *"hesitant"* means lingering without progress. Crossing in winter is fearful of cold; fearing four neighbors is wary of enemies—thus, the scholar does not dare lead the world, and his bearing is such.

*"Solemn"*—dignified and composed.
*"As a guest"*—following without presuming.
*"Dissolving"*—scattered and unfixed.
*"As ice about to thaw"*—melting yet not clinging.
*"Thick"*—sincere and unadorned.
*"Uncarved wood"*—raw material not yet shaped.
*"Vast"*—open and receptive.
*"As a valley"*—empty yet responsive.
*"Muddled"*—unrefined in appearance.
*"As turbid water"*—embracing both beauty and flaw without self-purification.

○ **Master He** says: In the twelfth month, the carts are built, and people do not yet fear crossing rivers. The difficulty of winter crossing mirrors the scholar’s caution—*"joyous as"* resembles this. *"No easy path"*—ears pressed to walls—this is the fear of four neighbors. The scholar’s secrecy is like *"hesitant."* The host does not inquire, the guest does not act first—the scholar does not lead others, hence *"solemn as."* Water freezes into ice, ice melts back to water—the scholar is unobstructed by things, hence *"dissolving as."* *"Thick as"* is like uncut wood not yet divided; *"vast as"* is like a valley not yet filled; *"muddled as"* is like turbid water receiving filth. Each description vividly portrays the likeness of the virtuous scholar’s *Dao*—hard to exhaust in words.

Who can make turbid water still and gradually clear?
Who can make the settled gradually move?

○ **Master Wu** says: This follows the *"muddled"* of above, asking: *"Who can make it turbid?"* Turbidity is the time of motion—when motion follows stillness, clarity emerges gradually. Again, from *"settled,"* it asks: *"Who can make it still?"* Stillness is the time of rest—when rest gives way to motion, life arises gradually. *"Settled"* means steadfast; *"move"* means activity. Only because of turbidity does clarity arise; only because of stillness does motion arise. Thus, the vast is not full yet full, the thick is not shaped yet shaped, the dissolving is not fixed yet fixed, the solemn is not the host yet the host, the hesitant is not the first yet the first—this can be understood.

○ **Master He** says: This *Dao* never fails to encompass both essence and function, permeating motion and stillness—it is not mere empty talk. To harmonize its light, to blend with dust, to mingle with the world’s turbidity—yet there is a quiet, detached clarity. To close the mouth, seal the gate—though settled and at rest, there is a sudden, spontaneous vitality. The two *"gradually"* emphasize natural, unforced progression. This speaks of how stillness can make turbidity gradually clear, and motion can make the settled gradually vital—motion and stillness in mutual use.

○ **Master Lin** says: These two lines simply mean clarity within turbidity, stillness within motion.

To preserve this *Dao* is to avoid fullness.
Only by avoiding fullness can one embrace decay;
Only by embracing decay can one avoid renewal.

○ **Master Wu** says: *"Renewal"* means completion. All things decay and become deficient, or renew and become complete. Decay and deficiency are signs of non-fullness; renewal and completion are signs of fullness. Those who preserve this *Dao* do not seek fullness, hence they embrace decay rather than renewal.

The seven bearings within this chapter are all decaying yet unrenewed.

○ **Master He** says: To preserve this *Dao* is to avoid fullness—this is emptiness. The *Dao* is boundless in its use; sometimes it is not full. Only because it is not full does it contrast with things. While others rush toward renewal and completion, I delight in decay, not hastening toward renewal.

○ **Master Lin** says: *"Avoid fullness"* is emptiness; *"decay"* is authenticity. To decay without renewal is to remain unchanged for a thousand years as one day—only thus can one achieve the *Dao*’s ultimate fulfillment, hence decay without renewal. *"Renewal"* is one phrase; *"completion"* is another.

○ **Master Li** says: Building upon the *Dao*’s essence from the previous chapter, it elucidates how later learners preserve sincerity, maintain reverence, and constantly guard their solitude—unfixed by appearances, yet embracing unity, emptiness, and daily practice. Until all attachments are extinguished, all illusions dissolved, until stirred yet not turbid, settled yet not clear—this is the *"subtle, mysterious, profound, and hidden"* communion.

Chapter Sixteen: **Attain the utmost emptiness, steadfastly guard the utmost stillness.**

○ **Master Wu** says: *"Attain"* is the process of reaching the utmost degree. *"Emptiness"* refers to the absence of substance, where external things do not penetrate within. *"Utmost"* means to exhaust its degree. *"Guard"* is to firmly hold within and resist without, like defending a city. *"Stillness"* means motionlessness, where the inner mind does not stray outward. *"Steadfast"* is the unflagging strength of this stillness.

○ **Master Lü** says: Emptiness upon emptiness, the spirit finds its dwelling; stillness upon stillness, the spirit finds its rectitude. *Liezi* states: *"Stillness is emptiness; in emptiness, the spirit finds its dwelling."* The *Sutra of Xisheng* says: *"If a person can be empty and without action, they do not seek the Dao, yet the Dao naturally returns to them."* ○ **Master He** says: *Liezi* also said, *"There are those who are born, and those who give birth."* Further, *"To give birth is to return to non-birth."* The sage perceives the subtle principle of birth and return: whatever emerges from the *Dao*’s mechanism must reenter it. Thus, I do not swell with all things; I observe how they begin with *Gèn* and must end with *Gèn*. Hence, I remain still and do not follow them together. *"Return"* means to abide in the Dao and remain constant. All things, myriad and teeming, each return to their root. Returning to the root is stillness; stillness is the return of life. ○ **Master Wu** says: *"Myriad and teeming"* describes the living and growing motion of all things. In spring and summer, the vital *qi* ascends from the roots to the branches and leaves—this is motion. In autumn and winter, the vital *qi* descends from above and returns to the roots—this is stillness. The *qi* of heaven generates life and forms all things, called *mìng* (命). When it returns to its original place of generation, it is called *"return of life"* (复命).

○ **Master Lü** says: All things arise from *nature* (性), like the roots of grasses and trees. They manifest through *Zhèn* (震), appear in *Lí* (离), explain in *Duì* (兑), labor in *Kǎn* (坎), and finally return to their roots. Grasses and trees have branches above and roots below, but humans are different: limbs are below, and the root is above—this is the *Níwán Gōng* (泥丸宫). The *Sutra of Yellow Court* (《黄庭经》) calls the brain *"Níwán"* (泥丸), the sacred domain of the *Dao*’s essence, where spirit and *qi* converge. If one can observe inwardly here, all spirits will gather, all *qi* will flow, and the *Tāixiān* (胎仙) will be perfected. Hence, *"All things, myriad and teeming, each return to their root."* The noble practitioner who constructs the Dao must begin by exhausting principles, proceed by perfecting nature, and conclude by returning life. None can attain the return of life without exhausting principles and perfecting nature. Now, clarity and openness in all directions—this is exhausting principles. To attain the utmost emptiness and steadfastly guard the utmost stillness—this is perfecting nature. *Guāngchéngzǐ* (广成子) with no seeing, no hearing, embraces the spirit in stillness, and when stillness is steadfast, clarity follows. Your spirit will then guard the form, the form will endure and grow, and enduring growth means life returns.

○ **Master Li** says: To practice emptiness and steadfast stillness, returning life to its root—this is the pure mystery of the spirit. If one attains this with a single, unblinking gaze, the study of a lifetime is complete. *"Return of life"* is constancy; knowing constancy is enlightenment. To not know constancy is to act recklessly—disastrous. Knowing constancy brings tolerance; tolerance brings fairness; fairness brings kingship; kingship brings heaven; heaven is the Dao; the Dao is enduring. Thus, one’s life is never in peril. ○ **Master Lin** says: To attain the return of life is to grasp the constancy that does not change. To know the enduring, unchanging Dao—this is enlightenment. Because people do not know this enduring, unchanging Dao, they indulge in reckless thoughts and actions, all of which are disastrous deviations from the Dao. Knowing constancy, one’s heart aligns with the vastness of heaven and earth—what cannot be embraced? Once embrace is achieved, what matter remains unfair? Kingship over all under heaven is this fair Dao. To rule with fairness is to rule with heaven. Heaven is the Dao, hence *"kingship is heaven; heaven is the Dao."* Enduring is constancy; if one attains this constant Dao, their entire life is without deviation—how could there be any peril? ○ **Master He** says: Only by knowing the constant cycle of growth and decay in all things does one grasp the principle of *swelling and waning* (盈虚消息). Thus, one does not cling to minutiae, and *"constancy becomes tolerance."* Knowing that beauty and ugliness, right and wrong can be embraced, one remains boundless and without bias—hence *"tolerance becomes fairness."* Fairness without self-interest is the kingly Dao. Kingship without bounds is the heavenly Dao. Enduring without cessation is the constant Dao of heaven.

The Dao endures through countless ages without flaw—what peril could there be? This is the ultimate attainment of *emptiness and tranquility* (虚静).

○ **Master Wu** says: Peril refers to endangering oneself. The character *殆* (dai), with the radical *歹* (evil), is glossed as *dangerous*, *near*, or *close*—most words with this radical carry the sense of *death*. Peril is danger approaching death. *没* (mo) means *to perish* or *terminate*.

**Chapter Seventeen**
The *Supreme Sage* (太上) is known only as existing.
The next is one whom the people love and praise.
The next is one whom the people fear and revile.

When virtue/power (信) is insufficient, there arises unbelief.

○ **Master Lü** says: The *Supreme Sage* (太上) is one whose teaching is *wuwei* (无为), whose governance is without exertion, harmonized with the Dao itself—nothing can be added above, hence *"the Supreme Sage."* Though he holds his position, he does not exalt himself, does not value nobility, but lets all things follow their natural course, each settling in its place, like the realm of *Hua Xu* (华胥之国). Thus, the world hears no talk of governance yet governs itself; the people, though aware of their ruler, say *"What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?"*

The *Zhou Shijing* (周诗) states:
*"Unknowing and unknowing, they follow the Emperor’s norms"*—hence *"the Supreme Sage is known only as existing."*

Moreover, in the ancient times, the people used knotted cords for record-keeping, lived in nests, and dwelled in caves, unaware of the passage of seasons or years—this may be called the utmost governance. *Fu Xi* and *Shen Nong* (伏羲神农) emerged, and the people began to till and eat, to weave and wear. They turned toward *ren* and *yi* (仁义), toward *li* and *yue* (礼乐), and the distinctions of praise and blame began to arise.

For a ruler, if his benevolence extends to the people, those who receive it regard him as a parent; if his righteousness is embraced, they praise him like the sun and moon. The more vivid the principle of love and praise becomes, the farther it strays from the ancient Dao.

The *Nanhua Jing* (《南华经》) says:
*"Shun’s conduct was humble, and the people delighted in it"*—hence *"the next is one whom the people love and praise."*

In later ages, governance grew artificial and deceitful, *ren* and *yi* were lost, *li* and *yue* abandoned, and the wise and foolish deceived one another. The world declined, yet the Dao persisted through political means, standardized by punishment, and the ruler’s authority was displayed to make the people *cang* (僶, yield) and obey—thus, the people did not fear his might but turned to deceit. When the people deceive, the heart to revile their ruler arises—hence *"the next is one whom the people fear and revile."*

The *Five Constant Virtues* (五常) take *virtue/power* (信) as their foundation. The *Rú* (鲁) saying declares:
*"Without virtue/power, the people cannot stand."* When virtue/power is complete, the world is secure; when lost, the world is in peril.

If *ren* and *yi* (仁义) vie with sincerity, gain and loss follow in turn, and cunning schemes flourish, deceit arises—this is the insufficiency of virtue/power. Once virtue/power is insufficient, the people’s hearts of unbelief emerge. As when the *Zhōu* (周) people established oaths and the people began to rebel—hence *"when virtue/power is insufficient, there arises unbelief."*

○ **Master Lin** says: The *Supreme Sage* (太上) refers to the ancient times. The *lower* (下) means the world below. In the ancient times, the people of the world saw only that their ruler existed, yet all forgot themselves in the Dao’s transformation. Later, the people began to regard their ruler with love and praise. Again later, they began to fear him. Again later, they began to revile him. This shows how the world’s Dao declines ever downward. When the *Supreme Virtue* (上德) decays and virtue/power (诚信) is insufficient, then the people’s hearts of unbelief arise. This is the meaning of *"the Shang* (商) people made oaths and the people began to rebel; the *Zhou* (周) people established assemblies and the people began to doubt."*

○ **Master He** says: When the Sage is above, he embraces the Dao without words, yet his benevolence reaches all things. The officials and courts appear empty, the halls and courts devoid of people—no labor, no wrongful punishments. All under heaven reveres his virtue, and at such times, the people know their ruler yet know nothing else, like fish forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes. This is the Dao of the *Supreme Sage.*

The next is when the great Dao is abandoned, yet *ren* and *yi* remain—then the ruler and the people are close and praise each other within the framework of *li* and *yue*, like fish nibbling and moistening one another.

The next is when governance becomes scrutinizing, and the people become wary—then the world begins to fear the law’s severity. Again the next is when laws are established and fraud arises, punishments carried out and deceit flourishes—then the people begin to deceive their ruler, to despise him, and to revile him afterward. This is like fish devouring one another.

*Zhuangzi*, in his insight into the ancient great Dao, saw that morality (道) and virtue (德) were first made clear, then *ren* and *yi* followed, and rewards and punishments were the last concern—he indeed perceived this truth.

The world’s Dao declines like a river’s current; it is difficult to restore the era when the people said *"What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?"* Yet when the *Supreme Sage* and *Way* are mixed with other influences, human hearts follow suit, and thus arise the shifts of affection, fear, respect, and contempt—all stemming from those above. This is the extreme of virtue/power’s insufficiency in moving the people.

Again it is said: *"Only when my virtue/power is insufficient do the people doubt me."*

○ **Master Li** says: The *Supreme Sage* (太上) cannot but be *wuwei*—this is the teaching of love and praise, the silent instruction. Those who are feared are governed by punishments and prohibitions; those who are reviled are rulers who have lost the people’s virtue/power. When the ruler loses virtue/power among the people, the people do not believe him. *"Ah, how precious are his words!"*

When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled, the people all say of him: *"He is but nature."* Master Li says: *"Ah, how precious are his words!"*—this is the silent instruction. Silent instruction, achieved through *wuwei*, means punishment is not enforced yet the people submit themselves. When his accomplishments and affairs are complete, he returns to simplicity and purity—then love, praise, fear, and revile all fade from the people’s minds. The people dwell in peace and delight in their customs, forgetting their origins, hence *"the people say of him: ‘He is but nature.’"*

○ **Master He** says: The Sage’s reason for saying *"Ah, how precious are his words!"* is that he dares not use *sheng* (声) and *se* (色, sounds and appearances) to transform the people. Only when he attains the silent instruction of *wuwei* can his deeds be accomplished and affairs settled, through the natural transformation of the people—making them praise him yet not praise themselves—this is how he saves the world’s endless decline.

○ **Master Lü** says: The ancient transformation was rooted in the principle of *wuwei*, in silent instruction alone. Its regard for words was thus: The *Yijing* (《易》) states:
*"Without words yet believed, lies in virtue and conduct"*—thus one knows that the Sage’s single word becomes the law for all under heaven. He himself knows his words are precious, hence he diminishes them again and again, remains silent yet again and again, though he still values his words and does not utter them lightly. Today’s people merely value words, yet they are but empty rhetoric—hence *"Ah, how precious are his words!"*

「The ruler of the Dao/Way makes the people improve daily and transform monthly, shifting to goodness and distancing from crime, allowing them to dwell in peace and take joy in their customs, while he governs with ease and observes from afar. The flourishing of the people and the winds of pure transformation can be restored, and when his work is accomplished and affairs settled, the common folk all say that they have found his natural Dao/Way.

**Chapter XVIII:**
When the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, there arise *rényì* (仁義, virtue and righteousness).
When *zhìhuì* (智慧, wisdom) emerges, there arises great deceit.
**Master Lin** says: When the Great Dao/Way is practiced, *rényì* is inherent within it. Once the names of *rényì* are established, the Dao/Way begins to fade. Hence it is said, *"When the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, there arises rényì."* It is like the sun rising daily, and only then does the deceit and falsehood of the world appear.
**Master Wu** says: The lower understanding of the previous chapter—that which is known and praised—is the Great Dao/Way. That which is cherished and commended is *rényì*. That which is feared or reviled is *zhìhuì*. From the Great Dao/Way, descending once and then again, already three grades are formed; when *zhìhuì* further transforms into great deceit, there are four grades in total. However, when the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, *rényì* arises, its change is still somewhat gradual. When *zhìhuì* emerges, great deceit swiftly follows, its change is far more abrupt.

**Master Lü** says: The Great Dao/Way is the *wuwei* Dao/Way of antiquity. In its flourishing, *rényì* is practiced within it, yet the people use it without knowing its origin—it is simply the Dao/Way. The Sage’s learning first seeks *dàodé* (道德, virtue/power of the Dao) before *rényì*, whereas the learning of the common world first seeks *rényì* before *dàodé*. Yet they do not realize that *yīnyáng* (陰陽, yin and yang) is the Dao/Way of Heaven, and *gāngróu* (剛柔, firmness and softness) is the Dao/Way of Earth. *Rényì* is the Dao/Way of humankind; its essence was never truly separate from the Dao/Way, nor did the Dao/Way ever abandon *rényì*. How is it that later generations cling to *rényì* as fixed laws, causing the pristine and natural Dao/Way to dwindle, and bringing about the harm of obscuring it? It is far better to conceal *rényì*, discard deceit, return to the origins, and align with nature, then the Dao/Way will not be abandoned.

Hence it is said:
*"When the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, there arises rényì,"*
*"When wisdom emerges from rényì, thieves and robbers arise from poverty,"*
*"When rényì is hidden, wisdom emerges,"*
*"When wisdom emerges, great deceit arises,"*
*"When wisdom is insufficient, it is followed by deceit."*
Hence it is said, *"When wisdom emerges, there arises great deceit."*

**Master He** says: In the *Zhuangzi*’s age of supreme *dàodé*, uprightness is natural yet not known as *rényì*, mutual love is natural yet not known as *rén* (仁, benevolence), sincerity is natural yet not known as *zhōng* (忠, loyalty), fittingness is natural yet not known as *xìn* (信, trustworthiness). Thus actions are performed without trace, and deeds are done without record. From this perspective, the names of *rén*, *yì*, *zhōng*, and *xìn* do not stand, yet their substance remains—this is the age of supreme *dàodé*, the practice of the Great Dao/Way.

When the *liúqīn* (六親, six relations of kinship) are not harmonious, there arise filial piety and compassion.
When the state is in chaos and disorder, there arise loyal ministers.»

「Master Lin says: Only when the *liúqīn* (六親) are not harmonious does the name of filial piety arise; only when the state is in chaos and disorder does the name of loyal ministers become known. These two lines are both allegorical.

**Master Wu** says: The *liúqīn* (六親) are father, son, elder and younger brothers, and husband and wife. If respect for rank and seniority follows its proper *Dao/Way*, and there is no discord, then filial piety is merely their natural duty, and they do not recognize it as *xiào* (孝, filial piety). The blind elder (瞽叟) did not act as a father, but when Shun (舜) was acknowledged as the sage-king, only then did the people know of the filial piety of the Great Shun (大舜之孝子). The state belongs to the ruler, and the family belongs to the minister; if the ruler and minister follow their proper *Dao/Way* without chaos or disorder, then loyalty is merely their natural duty, and they do not recognize it as *zhōng* (忠, loyalty). When King Jie (桀) of the Xia (夏) ruled unjustly and evil consorts gathered, only then did the people know of the loyal ministers like Bi Gan (比干) and the Three Ren (三仁).

**Master Lü** says: It is better to let the people transform naturally without governance than to wait for the state to fall into disorder and then display loyal ministers.

**Master Lü** further explains: When King Jie (桀) of the Xia (夏) stood, Longfeng (龙逢) became eminent; when King Zhou (纣) of the Shang (商) perished, Bi Gan (比干) shone forth.

Chapter Nineteenth: *"Abandon the Sage and discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold. Abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness. Abandon cleverness and discard profit, and thieves and robbers will vanish."*

**Master Wu** says: *"Abandon"* means to reject and not practice; *"discard"* means to reject and not employ. The Sage and wisdom refer to *zhìhuì* (智慧, wisdom). Cleverness and profit refer to *dàwěi* (大伪, great deceit).

**Master Lü** says: Form, measure, law, and model—these are the works of the Sage. Strategy, calculation, manipulation, and intrigue—these are the wisdom of the Sage. If one has a mind to practice wisdom, how could they know the utmost wisdom? The Perfect One fears that the people will be confused by the Sage’s wisdom, losing their true nature even more. They value returning to the root, abandoning the Sage’s artifices, discarding wisdom, and letting the people be like innocent children, devoted solely to agriculture and sericulture. The benefit to the people is far beyond a hundredfold, hence the saying: *"Abandon the Sage and discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold."*

Filial piety and kindness are the nature of Heaven; benevolence and righteousness are human inclinations. Heaven’s nature arises from spontaneity and cannot be altered. Benevolence, loving all things, makes the people close to it; righteousness, fitting all things, makes the people praise it. When the hearts of closeness and praise arise, the harmony of life and nature is lost. The Perfect One abandons them before they arise and discards them before they become reality, allowing people to return to their original state and restore their natural simplicity. Thus, the *Dao/Way* of filial piety and kindness is complete. Hence the saying: *"Abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness."*

Carving, polishing, and intricate craftsmanship—these are the cleverness of things. Precious gems, jade, measures of grain, and scales of balance—these are the profits of things. If one competes for cleverness, they will not care about shame; if one pursues profit, they will not care about righteousness, giving rise to thieves and robbers. If one can return to their true nature and reside in simplicity, then where would thieves and robbers come from? Hence the saying: *"Abandon cleverness and discard profit, and thieves and robbers will vanish."*

**Master Lin** says: Once the names of the Sage and wisdom arise, the harm to the world follows. It is better to abandon and discard them so that the world naturally benefits. Once the names of benevolence and righteousness arise, distinctions between filial and unfilial, kind and unkind, emerge. It is better to abandon and discard them, forgetting them in the *Dao/Way*, so that all people return to the natural state of filial piety and kindness without distinction. Cleverness and profit give rise to thieves and robbers; it is better to abandon and discard them, as in the saying: *"Do not value hard-to-obtain goods, so that the people will not steal."*

**Master Li** says: This elaborates on the meaning of the previous chapter, where the Sage, wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, cleverness, and profit are all abandoned and discarded, never to be employed again. Then the people will follow their natural transformation and return to simplicity.

**Master Lin** says: Some say that when the Old Master (老氏) abandons benevolence and discards righteousness, does he not contradict Confucius? Indeed, he traces the origin of *Dao/Way* to its source, asserting that though benevolence and righteousness, rites and music, can be used for governance, it is superior to govern the people through the *Dao/Way* and let them forget it in its midst.

These three teachings are insufficient as mere ornamentation; thus, they are given to those who belong to the realm of *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power*. To see one’s true substance and hold fast to simplicity, to have few thoughts and few desires.

**Master Lü** says: *"Abandon the Sage and discard wisdom"* is the first; *"abandon benevolence and discard righteousness"* is the second; *"abandon cleverness and discard profit"* is the third. All three belong to the sequence of *Dao/Way*, yet they do not obscure its reality.

The *Dao/Way* cannot be spoken of; any speech about it is merely its semblance. Those who attain understanding hear only its semblance and lose its truth. Though they record it in writing and pass it down through teaching, they still fear that people will doubt its semblance. Thus, it is known but not employed, spoken of but not understood. To discard ornamentation and uphold simplicity, there must be another path to follow, so that doubts dissolve like melting ice. Hence the saying: *"These three teachings are insufficient as mere ornamentation."*

*"Seeing one’s true substance"* means purity without admixture. *"Holding fast to simplicity"* means stillness and unity without change. To guard oneself with utmost fairness, not to love external beauty—this is having few private inclinations. To practice moderation and control emotions, to be serene and content—this is having few desires. Thus, to govern the state in this manner, one can elevate the people to the realm of benevolence and longevity, the age of *Xīhuáng* (羲皇, the mythical sage-king of antiquity). This is not difficult to achieve.

To govern oneself in this manner: one’s spirit becomes clear and pure, unaffected by external things—is this not *"seeing one’s true substance"*? One’s spirit does not diminish, preserved in the chaos of unity—is this not *"holding fast to simplicity"*? In eating, resting, and daily life, there is nothing but fairness and correctness—is this not having few private inclinations? To dwell in the tranquil and distant, severing all entanglements—is this not having few desires? To exchange these for that, what is there to prevent?

**Master He** says: It is not that the Sage’s wisdom, cleverness, and profit cannot be used in the world; rather, their names are mere ornamentation, not their true essence. If the world is allowed to settle in its natural life and nature, then these three can be dispensed with as mere names. The world not settling in its natural life and nature, while people only revere the names of these three and cling to them, is the greatest confusion. Ornamentation is insufficient; if they belong to the realm of *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power*, then it becomes reality. Hence, the Sage says: *"Those who practice cleverness, wisdom, and the Sage’s ways, I regard them as having cast off the *Dao/Way*. Thus, I harmonize all things without calling it benevolence, bestow blessings upon countless generations without calling it righteousness, cover and load the heavens and earth, carve and fashion all forms without calling it cleverness."* Hence the saying: *"Those who discard benevolence and righteousness are few; those who profit from benevolence and righteousness are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness is merely insincere, and relies on the tools of greedy and acquisitive people."* Thus, one person’s judgment benefits the world, but this is merely the false use of benevolence and righteousness. How could this be true benevolence and righteousness? It is far removed from the *Dao/Way*.»

「Yet the common folk fail to grasp its intent, deriding the rejection of the Sage’s ways and abandonment of cleverness as absurd, and scoffing at the abandonment of benevolence and righteousness as a deviation from the norm. Why do they not ponder the *Dao/Way*’s profound purpose, which seeks to guide all under Heaven to cultivate the *Hun-Cheng* (混成) *Dao/Way*? By discarding superficial adornments and returning to simplicity, they may attain their natural state. Hence the saying: *"Hold steadfast to one and do not mix with another; govern the inner and do not embellish the outer. Clarity enters into emptiness, and non-action returns to primal simplicity. Embrace nature, preserve the spirit."* When one’s selfishness and desires diminish, they merge into boundless selflessness and desirelessness. Once purity and sincerity are restored, the *Jiao-Jing* (浇竞) of strife is naturally dispelled. Then, the radiant Sage has no need for artificiality, the subtle *Dao/Way*’s intentions require no contrivance, the benevolence of universal love finds no place to dwell, the righteousness of governance has no need to intervene, and the tools of profit and cleverness are set aside. All under Heaven thus blends harmoniously into the great order. This is the ultimate intent of the Sage’s teachings.

The common folk are unworthy to recognize this truth—how can they dare to lightly judge it?

○ *Master Wu* said: The people of the *Dao/Way* outwardly appear as plain *xu* (素), inwardly uphold the uncarved *pu* (朴). *Xu* (素) is silk yet to be dyed, *pu* (朴) is wood yet to be shaped. Pure and simple, what need have they of artificiality?

**Chapter Twenty: Absolute Learning and No Worry**
How far apart are *"Absolute Learning"* and *"the One and the That"* (唯之与阿)?
How distant are *"good"* and *"evil"*?
What people fear, one must not fail to fear.
Vast and boundless, its end is beyond reckoning!

○ *Master Li* said: *"Absolute Learning"* means abandoning the learning of ordinary people and taking up what they do not learn—rejecting the world’s learning. Common folk are only concerned with learning for practical gain, augmenting their knowledge, ever fearful that their progress in the *Dao/Way* is not precise. The Sage, however, discards all acquisition and solely attends to the flavor of the *Dao/Way*, thus having no worries. *"How far apart?"* means they are not distant at all. *"How distant?"* means they are too far apart. What people fear, one must not fail to fear—good and evil are indeed things to be feared.

○ *Master He* said: This *"Absolute Learning"* is none other than the *Dao/Way*. Natural and effortless, it reaches the point of transcending form and name—this is *"Absolute Learning"*. One’s anxieties and thoughts should then be utterly forgotten. Though it is said there is no worry, what then is there to fear? Even without deliberate thought or outward form, one must still hold reverence and caution, for it is the resonance of *"the One"* (唯) and *"the That"* (阿). How distant they seem, yet in reverence, how slight is the neglect! Good and evil are but a single thought—how vast the divide between beauty and ugliness! *Zhuangzi* says that *"the beautiful becomes lasting, the evil cannot be rectified"*—how can one be too careful?

Here, even within *"no worry"*, there are things to be feared. Though the Sage forgets the world, they dare not treat it frivolously. Speaking of *"Absolute Learning and no worry"*, the forms of *"no form"* appear, the sounds of *"no sound"* are heard, the tastes of *"no taste"* are savored, and the teachings of *"no speech"* are imparted. With *"the whole cow in one’s eye"*, what is there to worry about?

From *"the One and the That"* regarding good and evil, the eyes dare not gaze indiscriminately, the ears dare not listen recklessly, the mouth dare not speak falsely, the body dare not move wantonly. To see a louse as large as a chariot wheel—how can one not fear? *Zhuangzi* says: *"How small it is! Yet this is how it belongs to humanity."* This is the saying of those who fear what people fear. *"How vast it is! Standing alone in its own nature."* This is the saying of *"Absolute Learning and no worry"*.

The *Dao/Way* reaches its utmost extent in effortless action, and its breadth is boundless. The *Dao/Way* begins with goodness itself, neither grand nor minute, neither arising nor ceasing. To seek its source, one finds it utterly beyond pursuit—what further use then for one’s mind?

○ *Master Dong* said: It is vast and boundless, with no known limits.
The multitude bustles in joy, as if feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat, as if ascending the Spring Terrace to gaze.
I alone remain tranquil, yet unseen—like an infant before it can laugh.
○ *Master Wu* said: *"Bustling in joy"* is the appearance of harmony and delight. *"Tranquil"* is stillness. *"Unseen"* is like the faintest crack in a tortoise shell’s divination. The common folk who engage in learning seek pleasure in outward things, like feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat, which delights the palate, or ascending the Spring Terrace to view, which satisfies the eyes. I, however, remain tranquil and still, my desires yet unopened, with no trace of ambition visible—like an infant unable to laugh or smile, entirely unaware of the world’s pleasures.

○ *Master Lin* said: The common folk take joy in the world’s flavors, like feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat or ascending the Spring Terrace to gaze, while I alone find contentment in guarding simplicity and stillness. My thoughts are a hundredfold unformed, like the infant before it can laugh. *"Unseen"* is form, is budding—this heart does not bud nor move, hence *"unseen"*.

An infant is born, and a child grows slightly older. The infant’s heart is entirely without knowledge.

○ *Master He* said: The common folk are like those feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat, delighting their senses and bodies, or ascending the Spring Terrace to indulge in unrestrained viewing—bustling in joy, finding ample delight. I, however, am yet unseen, like an infant just born, before reaching the stage of laughter. One cannot perceive my head if they approach me.

*"Leaning and resting"* (乘乘兮), as if having nowhere to return.
○ *Master Wu* said: *"Leaning and resting"* means dwelling in things, yet having nowhere to return—it means not clinging to them.

○ *Master He* said: *"Leaning and resting"* with nowhere to return—dwelling in things while the mind wanders freely, like riding the wind and treading the void, finding no place to anchor. One follows them without seeing their trail.

It is also said: *"Leaning and resting"* is like riding the wind, like driving the clouds—both are metaphors of riding the wind and harnessing the floating.

○ *Master Lü* said: To blend with the world and move unnoticed, to merge with things and ride their waves, the heart fuses with form, and the body releases its burdens, becoming one with the spirit. Like a hollow boat drifting east and west, or a leaf fluttering high and low, one does not know if the wind rides them or they ride the wind. No one knows where they are going, hence *"Leaning and resting"* with nowhere to return.

The common folk all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.
○ *Master Lin* said: The common folk all possess a heart of seeking and filling, while I alone appear to abandon and discard—this means that in my pursuit of the *Dao/Way*, I have no heart of excess.»

○ **Master Lü** said: The common folk follow what they know, drowning in wealth and honor, believing they have abundance in their joy. But the Perfect One is not so. He discards fame and profit like chaff, treats high office and lowly matters alike—knowing that both body and world are illusory. His heart is as empty as space, forgetting all things. Thus it is said: *"The common folk all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned."*

○ **Master Wu** said: *"Abandoned"* means *lost*. The common folk rejoice in their abundance, but I, having nothing, feel a quiet loss.

○ **Master Dong** said: *"Abandoned"* means *forgotten*—having yet not having. Oh, how simple-minded I am! Stupid and unknowing.

○ **Master Lü** said: The most eloquent in the world do not excel in speech but in silence; the wisest do not excel in cleverness but in foolishness. Those who act foolish all day do so because they do not deplete their spirit.

○ **Master Wu** said: *"Stupid"* is like the original chaos (*Hun Dun*), dark and indistinct, unable to distinguish—just as in *Zhuangzi*, *"foolish"* means without knowledge.

○ **Master Lin** said: *"Stupid and unknowing"* describes the undifferentiated chaos. The common folk are bright and discerning, while I alone am dim and confused. The common folk are sharp and probing, while I alone am dull and obscured.

○ **Master Lü** said: The common folk expend their spirit outward, dazzling and radiant, seeking only to hear more, to increase their knowledge, to show off their learning—like parading the sun and moon. But the Perfect One’s wisdom encompasses all things, his inner light illuminating like a hidden treasure. Though he wears coarse robes, he holds jade within; outwardly, he lacks brilliance. Thus it is said: *"The common folk are bright, while I alone am dim."* The common folk are strict and rigid, boastful and self-made, clinging to their narrow views, lost in trivialities, scrutinizing the depths of the sea yet unable to stop. But the Perfect One follows Heaven and the Dao, wandering freely, vast and inclusive, beyond measure—dim, silent, and unfathomable. Thus it is said: *"The common folk are sharp, while I alone am dull."*

○ **Master Lin** said: *"Dim and dull"* is the same as chaos. The common folk are bright and sharp, while I alone am dim and dull—this is how I differ from them.

○ **Master Wu** said: *"Bright"* is already clear, *"sharp"* even more so. *"Dim"* is unclear, *"dull"* even more so. The common folk take knowledge for wisdom, but I alone am ignorant and foolish. Drifting like the sea, whirling like endless wind.

○ **Master Lin** said: Like sailing on the vast ocean, the wind howling without end—this is the meaning of *"Leaning and resting, with nowhere to return."*

○ **Master Wu** said: Like floating on the sea, drifting without direction, or the endless wind rising without rest. The common folk all have purpose, but I alone seem stubborn and crude.

○ **Master Wu** said: The common folk all have purpose—that is, they know where they are going. *"Stubborn"* means numb like a paralyzed face, unaware of pain. *"Crude"* means rustic. I alone am dull and ignorant, like a distant fool. Those who dwell in bustling cities know much, while those in remote, barren places know little.

○ **Master Lin** said: *"Purpose"* means *action*. The common folk all act, but I delight in seeking nothing, thus appearing stubborn and crude.

○ **Master Dong** said: *"Purpose"* means *use*. *"Dull"* means *without knowledge*. *"Crude"* means *wild*. All people know the use of what is useful, but not the use of what is useless. I alone differ from them, cherishing to *"feed at the Mother."*

○ **Master Wu** said: This sentence summarizes what came before—from the common fear of excess to my own abandonment, speaking of how scholars strive for many talents, while I alone possess none; from my simple heart to my stubborn crudeness, speaking of how scholars seek much knowledge, while I alone know nothing. Thus I differ from them. What I value is the profound virtue of the Dao—the Dao being the Mother of all things. Thus it is said, *"Feed at the Mother."* To feed at the Mother is like nursing at a wet nurse. Sima [Qian] said: *"Nurturing the Original Harmony."*

○ **Master Lin** said: What makes me different is my taste for the Dao—the Dao, named the Mother of all things. *"Feed"* means *taste*. To cherish feeding at the Mother is to value seeking taste in the Dao.

○ **Master Li** said: The Sage abandons all things, attending only to the Dao, feeding at the Mother, guarding the feminine and embracing unity—thus there is no worry.

○ **Master Lü** said: The Dao is the root of all things. As fish depend on water—if fish lose their water, they die—what would happen if humans lost the Dao? One must know that spirit is the child of *qi*, and *qi* is the Mother of spirit. Without the Mother’s nourishment, one cannot live; without *qi*’s sustenance, one cannot thrive. Thus it is said, *"Feed at the Mother."* If one continuously draws from this nourishment above and below, then the body will not decay, and the spirit will not be depleted. Hence, *"Feed at the Mother"* is most precious.

○ Some say: *"Purpose"* is used to explain *"cherishing to feed at the Mother,"* but the interpretations differ—how can this be? It is said: Though the words differ, their meaning both return to *tasting the Dao.*

**Chapter 21**
The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.

○ **Master Lü** said: The constant Dao is nameless; only virtue reveals it. Supreme virtue has no origin—it arises from following the Dao. The Dao is formless, but when it moves, it becomes virtue, taking shape. Never for a moment departing from the Dao, hence *"follows only the Dao."*

○ **Master Wu** said: *"Great virtue"* is like abundant virtue. *"Bearing"* refers to what exists and is visible. *"Follows"* means *conforms to*.

---

**All things derive from virtue.**

○ **Master Lü** said: The virtue that gives rise to this manifestation is born from the Dao. The visible forms and *qi* are the *bearing of virtue*.

○ **Master Wu** said: *"Great"* is indeed *"abundant."* Those who understand the Dao follow it alone, yet even those who see beyond it possess the bearing of great virtue. *"Virtue"* (德) means *that which is obtained*—what one obtains within oneself is virtue. Since the Dao is invisible yet virtue is visible, virtue is thus called the *bearing of the Dao*.

**The nature of the Dao** is but *dim and vague*.

○ **Master Lü** said: The Dao is obscure and difficult to speak of—what substance can be likened to it? Those who speak of its "nature" force a name upon it to probe its profound essence. Since the Dao is formless, from what can it be said to arise? Now, if one seeks the Dao through things, it cannot be obtained; if one seeks the Dao apart from things, it has no boundary. Examining its *dim and vague* essence, one finds that *dim* seems to be *having*—a having within the void—while *vague* seems to be *not having*—a not having within the having. Dwelling in the void is not void, hence *space is form*; dwelling in form is not form, hence *form is space*. Thus, the essence of *dim and vague* can be imagined. Hence it is said: **The nature of the Dao is but dim and vague.**

○ **Master Wu** said: *Dim and vague*—having yet not having—cannot be seen. Hence it is said: *dim and vague*. Within the *vague*, there is *form*; within the *dim*, there is *substance*. Within the *obscure* and *profound*, there is *essence*. This essence is most true, within which there is *faith*. Within the *faith*, there is *truth*.

○ **Master Lü** said: The *form* within *dim* appears to have form, yet its source is nowhere to be found—thus it cannot be seen, nor can it be heard. If sight and hearing cannot grasp it, how can one measure the *obscure and profound*? To call it *not having* is to say it wondrously encompasses all things; to call it *having* is to say its form cannot be perceived. The *form of the Great Void* is having yet not having—from it, transformation arises, and all things emerge. The *substance of the Great Void* is not having yet having—from it, wind and thunder are born, and frost and dew descend. When there is *form*, the names of things are established; when there is *substance*, they arise from the utmost *essence*. Obscure yet deep and boundless, vast yet silent, *having within the void*, it encompasses the roots of all transformations, conceals the *essence of the Great Void*, and nurtures the *faith of Nature*. Thus all classes of things are born, and the Three Realms are complete. *The Broad Virtue Master* says: **"The essence of the ultimate Dao is obscure and profound; the extreme of the ultimate Dao is dark and silent. Its origin is such."**

The heart is the palace of *dim and vague*, the kidneys the storehouse of *obscure and profound*. The heart harbors the spirit, the kidneys the *essence*. The *essence and spirit* of the body dwell within the *dim and vague*. Hence it is said: *vague yet obscure*, within which there is *form*; *dim yet vague*, within which there is *substance*; *obscure and profound*, within which there is *essence*. If the *essence* is refined, it weaves through all directions, wondrously uniting the body. In alchemy, it is called the *Great Medicine*; in the *I Ching*, it is called *Central Trust* (中孚). All changes cannot alter it, and Nature cannot displace it. The marvel within marvels, the truth within truths, it responds instantly when stirred—thus it can give birth in spring and cause death in autumn, never failing. Applied to the body, it ascends as *ancestral qi*, circulates as *Yi flow* (沂流), and transforms from yellow to red. Its Dao follows the seasons, hence it is said: **its essence is most true, within which there is faith.**

○ **Master He** said: In ancient times, a scholar of profound mysteries expounded this chapter thus: *"Form"* is not always *form*, and *"essence"* is not always *essence*. Heaven obtains clarity through it, Earth obtains tranquility, and humanity obtains vitality. Those who can embrace the *mysterious* and hold to the *One*, seeking *essence* in the *obscure and profound* and *substance* in the *dim and vague*, achieve a perfect union of form and spirit with the true Dao. When one speaks of *form*, *substance*, and *essence*, all are within the *dim and vague* and *obscure and profound*—having within the void. Yet it is said that this *essence* is most true, and that there is *faith*—meaning there is no void without having, nor having without void.

○ **Master Wu** said: Former sages spoke of the *void and boundless* without eyes, yet all things stood arrayed within it. From ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, for it surveys all *beauty*.

○ How do I know that all *beauty* is such? **Thus.**

○ **Master Lü** said: Since the dawn of antiquity, down to the present, it has ever existed, manifesting its power in each season. It has never been named, yet we force the name *"true essence"* upon it—enduring through the ages, unchanging, it is the eternal nature of the *One*. Sitting and observing the myriad beauties of Heaven and Earth, witnessing life and death’s completion, hence it is said: **from ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, for it surveys all beauty.** Yet all beauty undergoes ceaseless change—how do I know that all things draw their resources and endowments from it? **It is because the Dao reaches everywhere, thus it governs all transformations.**

○ **Master He** said: This Dao precedes Heaven and Earth yet does not endure long; it persists through antiquity yet does not grow old. Though it is ever nameless, its name cannot be erased—this is the *"Dao of the Constant"* from the first chapter. It is called the *Dao of the Constant Dao*. Sitting and observing all beauty as it emerges, *beauty* (甫) means *perfection*—all perfection, for the Dao is complete. Hence it is said: **the void and boundless, yet all perfection follows it; this is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the Sage.** How do I know that all perfection is such? **Thus, by this Dao.** To survey all perfection is to survey all principles beneath Heaven—each must pass through the mind.

○ **Master Lin** said: The name of the Dao is present in both ancient and modern times; it cannot be erased for even a day, yet all goodness arises from it. *All perfection* means *all beauty*; *survey* means *to pass through and observe*. All goodness comes and goes through this Dao. **Thus, by this Dao.**

○ **Master Wu** said: *"Does not fade"* means *eternally preserved*; *survey* is *to pass through*; *beauty* is *perfection*—all things are *beauty*. Yet all things’ beauty varies with time and perishes; only the *Great Virtue*, arising from the Dao, endures from ancient times to the present, unchanging and unperishing. Hence it is said: **from ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, for it surveys all beauty.**

Thus, it is so. How could I know that all things’ changes and perishings are without constancy, as they are? **By this Great Virtue’s enduring Dao, I know.**

**Dao/Way and Virtue Classic: Collected Meanings, Volume III**
**Dao/Way and Virtue Classic: Collected Meanings, Volume IV**
**Chapter XXII of the *Xu Jiang Wei Da You* Collection: "The Crooked Becomes Whole, the Twisted Becomes Straight"**

The **crooked** becomes **whole**,
The **twisted** becomes **straight**,
The **hollow** becomes **full**,
The **ruined** becomes **renewed**,
The **few** become **many**,
The **many** bring **confusion**.

**Master Lü** said: The Sage hooks deep and reaches far, yet all movement follows principle. Where principle abides, none beneath Heaven can compete with it.

**To cultivate one’s nature**, nothing surpasses *clarity of mind*.
**To preserve one’s body**, nothing surpasses *avoiding harm*.
Thus, by bending and curving one’s talents,
By adjusting speech and silence,
By conforming to what is fitting,
And not contending with things,
One does not lose the **Great Whole**,
So one achieves the **Virtue of Non-Contention**—hence it is said: **The crooked becomes whole**.

The **keen** and **clear** perceive all things,
The **wise** discern their distinctions,
Yet they abandon them without complaint,
And endure adversity without pity.
Their **straightness** is like an arrow,
Their **truth** is like a taut string.
Ever yielding yet harmonizing with the waves,
Like the inchworm’s gradual unfolding,
They bend and submit without losing their **straightness**—
Thus they may be called **Great Straightness**—hence it is said: **The twisted becomes straight**.

Rivers and valleys are **hollow** and low,
Yet water flows toward them.
Though one might wish not to be **full**,
It cannot be avoided.

In humility and modesty,
All **virtues** gather to one—hence it is said: **The hollow becomes full**.

The **Perfect Sage** fragments his **virtue**,
Ruinously thins his body,
Makes **Great Whiteness** seem like shame,
And **True Authenticity** appear as flaw—
Then all beneath Heaven gladly embrace him without tiring.
His Dao is ever **renewed**.

The *Yangzi* [text] asks: **"How does the ruined become renewed?"**
To **renew** is to **inherit**,
To **ruin** is to **augment**—
Thus one may be said to **renew his virtue daily**,
Without being harmed by external things—hence it is said: **The ruined becomes renewed**.

The Dao does not value complexity.
The more one hears and sees,
The less one adheres to its simplicity.
The **easy** is easy to follow,
The **simple** is easy to obey—
**Ease and simplicity** attained,
All beneath Heaven’s principles are attained.

Those who **master life’s preservation**,
With **few thoughts, few deliberations**,
**Few desires, few fixations**,
Hold fast without losing—
Thus they attain it—hence it is said: **The few become many**.

Human nature loves victory,
And prizes excess.
Yet the Dao does not desire excess—
Excess brings **chaos and disturbance**.
Many paths lead to lost sheep,
Many methods lead to lost Dao.
Cultivating the body through **excessive thought** scatters the spirit,
**Excessive scheming** drowns wisdom—
This is not the way to **embrace Unity**—hence it is said: **The many bring confusion**.

**Master He** said: This chapter begins with **the crooked becomes whole** and ends with **whole and restored**—thus one sees the Dao’s **naturally unified Great Whole**, like rivers and valleys to the sea, unobstructed though they twist a million times.

It is not that the **crooked** can force the **whole**—
Rather, the **Great Whole**’s inherent nature transcends Heaven,
And the **crooked** fulfills its forms.

To know the **Great Whole** of Heaven and Earth,
All is contained within me.
Yielding to things, harmonizing with their waves,
I act thus in this world—
**Straightness** cannot be followed directly.
How could I ever violate the Dao for empty praise,
Like those of later ages who despise the **crooked**?

Thus, the four quarters are balanced and equal—
The Dao’s **straightness** is its core,
Yet **twistedness** preserves its **wholeness**.
The six **empties** flow freely—
The Dao’s **fullness** is its core,
Yet **hollowness** preserves its **wholeness**—
**Humility receives benefit**.
Enduring ancient times without aging—
The Dao’s **renewal** is its core,
Yet **ruin** preserves its **wholeness**—
**Hidden yet clear**.

**The few become many**—**Unity**.
**The many bring confusion**—**Diversity**.

**Master Lin** said: Only by mastering the **crooked** can one achieve the **whole**,
Only by mastering the **twisted** can one achieve the **straight**,
Only by mastering the **hollow** can one achieve the **full**,
Only by mastering the **ruined** can one achieve the **renewed**,
Only by mastering the **few** can one achieve the **many**—
These all mean:
By embracing **insufficiency**, one achieves **excess**,
By embracing **true emptiness**, one achieves **true presence**.
**The few become many**—
Yet these three words are further refined into two sentences:
**The few become many, the many bring confusion**.

Thus the Sage **embraces Unity** as the model for all beneath Heaven.

**Master Lü** said: **Unity** is humanity’s true nature.
Yet the Dao’s **Unity** has many kinds—
One must not fail to know them.

There is the **Unity** of the Dao,
The **Unity** of **non-Unity**.
There is the **Unity** of the Spirit,
The **Unity** of **True Authenticity**.
There is the **Unity** of *qi*,
The **Unity** of **One without Unity**.
There is the **Unity** of Water,
The **Unity** of **Heaven’s One generating Water**.

This **embrace of Unity** refers to the **Unity** of **True Authenticity**.
To know **Unity** is to know **non-Unity**.
In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor journeyed to Mount Éméi to meet the **Celestial True Sage**,
Who said: *"I beg you to teach the Dao of **True Unity**!"*
The **Celestial True Sage** replied: *"This is the most profound teaching of the Dao family.
Its scripture is hidden within the **Five Cities**,
And I have heard it says:
**Unity** lies within the **Northern Pole’s Great Abyss**,
With the **Hall of Brightness** before,
And the **Vermilion Palace** behind.
Majestic are the **Flowering Canopy**,
And the **Golden Hall’s arched roof**—
This is the **True Unity**’s essence."*

When it speaks of the **Northern Pole’s Great Abyss**,
It refers to the **True Unity**’s divine chamber—
Located in the **ear’s aperture**,
Before the **Hall of Brightness**,
Behind the **Jade Pillow**,
Beneath the **Flowering Canopy**,
And above the **Vermilion Palace**—
The **Vermilion Palace** is the **Dirt Pellet** [泥丸],
And the **Celestial Sovereign** [天帝] is the **Uppermost Red Child**’s dwelling.
It is said the ears belong to the kidneys—
Hence it is the **Northern Pole’s Great Abyss**.

The *Xisheng Jing* [西升经] states:
*"When one attains **Unity**,
All affairs are complete.
Knowing it and acting upon it,
One may follow the **True Authenticity**’s method—
Hence it is said: **Embrace Unity as the model for all beneath Heaven**."*

**Master He** said: The Sage **embraces Unity** as the world’s model.
**Unity** is the Dao’s origin—
The **Great Whole**’s naturally unified essence.

Not self-displaying, thus **clear**,
Not self-asserting, thus **manifest**,
Not self-praising, thus **functional**,
Not self-exalting, thus **enduring**.

For only in **non-contention**,
None beneath Heaven can contend with it.

**Master Wu** said: **Self-displaying** is like **self-flaunting**,
**Clear** refers to the **Spirit’s clarity**.
Not **self-displaying** means
Using **obscurity to achieve clarity**.

**Master Wu** said:
*"Self-asserting"* is like *"self-praising"*—*"manifest"* refers to its illumination.
*"Not self-asserting"* means
Obscure yet ever more luminous.

To boast of one’s deeds is *"self-praising"*—*"deeds"* refers to accomplished works.
To arrogate one’s superiority is *"self-exalting"*—*"superiority"* means surpassing others’ abilities.

Not self-displaying, not self-asserting,
Not self-praising, not self-exalting—
Yet with *"non-contention"* as its culmination,
These four are all metaphors for *"non-contention."*

**Master Lin** said:
Not self-displaying, not self-asserting, not self-exalting—
All express the intent of *"not possessing what one possesses."*
If I contend not with the world,
Then what is there to contend for?

**Master Li** said:
From *"not self-displaying"* onward,
All admonish against excess and advocate humility.
Through humility and submission,
There is no contention—
Thus preserving one’s foundation.
The ancients’ saying *"yielding preserves wholeness"*—
Was it mere empty words?
Truly whole, and thus it returns.

**Master Wu** said:
The phrase *"yielding preserves wholeness"*—
Was an ancient saying, which Laozi cited
As the opening of this chapter.
Within the chapter, *"Embrace Unity"* is the guiding thread,
And *"yielding preserves wholeness"* below, along with the five *"non-contention"* points,
Totaling ten matters—
All encompassed by *"yielding preserves wholeness."*
Thus, it is restated at the chapter’s end:
*"The ancients’ saying ‘yielding preserves wholeness’—*
Was it mere empty speech without substance?
Rather, because it is sincere and complete,
Its effects return to wholeness."*

**Master Dong** said:
Laozi merely transmitted, not composed—
Sayings like *"yielding preserves wholeness"* were ancient texts.
This reinforces that his words were not baseless,
Urging with deep sincerity.
If scholars truly grasp the Way of yielding and bending,
Then the Dao’s completeness and reality
All return to them.
The Dao is inherently human—
Thus *"return"* means restoring to its origin.

---
**Chapter 23**
*Rare speech aligns with Nature.*
A gusting wind does not last the morning,
A sudden rain does not last the day.
Who does this?
The heavens and the earth.

「The heavens and the earth cannot endure even this,
Yet would humanity die from it?
**Master He** said:
The text states: *"Listening yet not hearing is called 'rare'"*—
This "rare" refers to what?
It means *nature* itself, the speech of the Great Dao.

Here, the sentence should end with "rare" alone,
Not to be paired with "rare speech" against "much speech"—
That would be a shallow understanding.

Those who study the Dao/Way cultivate their mind in stillness,
Merge their *qi* with emptiness,
Boundless and formless, silent and void,
Thus the opening line speaks of *rare* alone.

The "rare" of the Great Sound—
This is *nature* itself.
Saying *rare*, saying *nature*—
This is the mystery of the Dao.

A gusting wind and sudden rain do not last the day—
Gusting winds and sudden rains,
These are the *qi* of reckless haste,
Thus they vanish quickly.

The *qi* of gusting and suddenness is not *nature*,
Then it cannot endure.
The heavens and the earth cannot even endure this,
Yet how much more so for humanity?

**Master Wu** said:
*"Listening yet not hearing is called 'rare'"*—
"Rare" means speechlessness.
Those who attain the Dao forget speech,
Following only their own *nature*.
A gusting wind is a violent, swift wind;
From dawn to midday is what is meant by *lasting the morning*.
Sudden rain is a fierce, hasty rain;
From dawn to nightfall is what is meant by *lasting the day*.
To act rashly and speak without restraint,
Like the heavens and the earth’s gusting winds and sudden rains—
These are all contrary to *nature*’s constancy,
Becoming strange and unnatural.

The heavens and the earth, contrary to *nature*’s constancy,
Cannot endure even this,
Not even lasting the morning or the day—
Yet how much more so for humanity,
If it cannot follow *nature*’s constancy?
Is this possible?

**Master Li** said:
Gusting winds and sudden rains—
This is a metaphor for reckless movement and hasty progress,
Far from lasting.

**Master Lü** said:
Gusting winds and sudden rains—
These are metaphors for things that do not last,
For the *Tàishàng* warns against
Excessive joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—
When emotions erupt without measure,
Movement and stillness lose their proper order.

The "rare" is the Dao/Way of what cannot be seen.
Thus, those who engage in the Dao—
The Daoists align with the Dao,
Those of *virtue/power* align with *virtue/power*,
And those who stray align with loss.»

**Master Wu** said:
To engage in the Dao means to take the Dao as one’s affair.
The Dao refers to those who possess the Dao,
*Virtue/power* refers to those who possess *virtue/power*,
And loss refers to the common and lowly.

What they do cannot but have some failing.
This aligns closely with *Zhuāngzi*’s *Qíwù Lùn* ["Equating Things"], which means to harmonize with them, merging as one without contradiction or distinction.
Only by following their own nature and speaking rarely can one achieve this,
So all—high, middle, and low—are seen as equal, without contradiction or distinction.

Indeed, those of the Dao and *virtue/power*,
Are one with me,
And mutually verify and confirm each other—
How could there be separation?

As for those of loss,
Though others may call them lost,
They themselves believe they are correct,
And indeed, they have their own natural correctness.

How could one not follow their own correctness,
And instead rashly speak against it?

*Zhuāngzi* says that silence is equating,
But equating with speech is not equating,
And speech with equating is not equating—
Thus, there is no speech,
Which is also Laozi’s intent of rare speech, natural harmony, and mysterious unity.

**Master Li** said:
Those who engage in the Dao
Are gentle and harmonious in *virtue/power*,
Merged with all things,
Naturally resonating and responding to them,
And things naturally responding in kind.

Again, those of the Dao align with the Dao—
A unified vision as one body.
Those of *virtue/power* align with *virtue/power*—
Meaning they do not harbor dualistic views.
Those of loss align with loss—
Without discrimination.

**Master Lü** said:
The Perfect One aligns with the Dao, with *virtue/power*, and with loss,
Yet does not cling to things.
They know not of the Dao’s existence,
Nor of *virtue/power*’s existence,
Nor of loss’s existence—
Transcending the physical and material,
Free from worries of gain or loss.

Those who align with the Dao,
The Dao also finds them.
Those who align with *virtue/power*,
*Virtue/power* also finds them.
Those who align with loss,
Loss also finds them.

**Master Wu** said:
Those of *virtue/power*,
See me as one with them,
And mutually verify and confirm each other—
What separation could there be?

As for those of loss,
Though I see them as one with me,
Perhaps they cling to their own narrow correctness,
And through this, awaken me to the broader truth—
Thus, all three kinds of people
Confirm my understanding through their own ways.

Yet only those who truly possess the Dao can achieve this.
If the Dao’s essence is deficient within oneself,
Then one’s treatment of others will not reflect its true nature,
And distinctions of right and wrong will be forcibly imposed—
How could one achieve such mysterious unity?

**Master Li** said:
Self-perception, self-affirmation, self-praise, and self-boasting—
All are rooted in private intent.
Private intent solidifies into harm to the public—
How could this endure?

Thus, those who possess the Dao do not dwell here.
"Excess food, superfluous movement"—
Like leftover food or parasitic growths,
They are what the world despises.

**Master Lü** said:
The Perfect One’s Dao-heart is boundless and void,
They gaze upon things with playful detachment,
Treating life and death as a single thread,
And possibility and impossibility as a single continuum.
They look back upon those who self-perceive, self-affirm, self-praise, and self-boast—
Like discarded leftovers or superfluous actions,
What heaven rejects, what earth transforms,
What humanity despises—
And much less so for the Perfect One,
Who exhausts principles and fathoms nature,
Reaching the pinnacle of the Dao—
They never consider such things,
And should avoid them for life.

**Master Lin** said:
Self-perception, self-affirmation, self-praise, and self-boasting—
All are cases of holding onto one’s own while failing to transform.

**Master Wu** said:
Those who cling to self-perception
Will never truly be enlightened,
Those who cling to self-affirmation
Will never truly shine,
Those who cling to self-praise
Will never achieve true merit,
Those who cling to self-boasting
Will never have lasting virtue—
Just as those who stand on tiptoe
Cannot truly stand,
And those who stride too widely
Cannot truly walk.

"Excess food, superfluous movement"—
Some say: *xíng* (行) should be read as *xíng* (形), for ancient characters were interchangeable.

**Master Sima** said:
Discard the surplus of food,
And thus one may avoid causing others revulsion.
Remove the superfluous growths of flesh,
And thus one may avoid causing others ugliness.

**Chapter Twenty-Five:** There is a thing that blends into unity,
Born before heaven and earth.

**Master Lü** said:
The *Taiyi* (太易) is the state before *qi* (炁) was seen.
The *Tai’chu* (太初) is the beginning of *qi*.
The *Taishǐ* (太始) is the beginning of form.
The *Taìsù* (太素) is the beginning of substance.
When *qi*, form, and substance are all present yet not yet separated,
It is called *hùn lún* (浑沦).
Neither clear nor turbid, it remains serene and ever-present;
Neither high nor low, it cannot be divided by myriad streams.
Heaven and earth arise from it,
And all things transform through it.
The perfected one embodies it,
Thus returning to the root and recovering the vital breath,
Restoring one’s original nature to its beginning.

Within the daze of *huánglǔn* (恍惚),
Ten thousand harmonies merge into one,
The true essence of all things is grasped,
And their original form is revealed.
Before the heavens and earth were formed,
Before the *hún dùn* (混沌) took shape,
This is the source of the Dao.
In humans, it manifests as the nature of *miào jué* (妙觉),
Enduring through countless *kālpas* (劫) without interruption.
Hence, it is said: *"There is a thing that blends into unity,
Born before heaven and earth."*

**Master Lin** said:
*"There is a thing that blends into unity"*—this is the Dao.
The *Wuji* (无极) gives rise to the *Taiji* (太极),
Its birth precedes that of heaven and earth.
It speaks of heaven and earth arising from this Dao.

**Master Wu** said:
*"There is a thing that blends into unity"*—the "thing" refers to the Dao,
And "blends into unity" means complete without division or distinction.
*"Born before heaven and earth"*—just as the first chapter speaks of *"the beginning of heaven and earth"*,
And the fourth chapter speaks of *"the time before the Emperor of Forms"* (象帝).

Silent and boundless,
It stands alone yet never alters,
Circulates endlessly yet never falters,
Capable of being the mother of all under heaven.

**Master Lü** said:
Silent—without sound,
Boundless—without form.
Empty and profound, vast and obscure,
Neither past nor future,
Standing alone without counterpart,
Never changing or transforming—
What could pair with it?
Thus it can traverse the eight *huáng* (纮),
Endlessly adapt and respond,
Revolving without error.
All things have rise and decline,
The Dao knows no limits.
Things cannot see its movement yet it moves,
Cannot see its rest yet it rests.
Moving then resting, resting then moving,
Like an endless ring.
Things, great or small,
All turn toward the Dao.
Obtaining it brings wholeness,
Losing it brings harm.
Life and completion depend upon it.

**Master Lin** said:
Silent and boundless—
It cannot be seen.
Standing alone yet never altering—
It endures eternally without change.
Circulating endlessly yet never faltering—
It moves with vigor yet never ceases.
Capable of being the mother of all under heaven—
The origin from which all things arise.
Silent—utter stillness.
Boundless—vast emptiness.
It speaks of its formlessness and soundlessness.
Standing alone beyond all things,
Without equal or opposition,
Yet never varying or transforming—
Hence, *"never alters."*
Circulating through all things,
Reaching everywhere without end,
Yet never exhausted or failing—
Hence, *"never falters."*
Nurturing all things—
Hence, *"the mother of all under heaven."*

I do not know its name,
So I call it *Dao*.
Forcing a name upon it, I call it *Great*.
Great—it passes away,
Passing away—it grows distant,
Distant—it returns.

**Master Lin** said:
I do not know its name,
And no name can truly capture it.
Since it cannot be named, I call it *Dao*—
A substitute name.
Saying *Dao* is insufficient,
I force another name upon it—*Great*.
*Great* is also insufficient,
So I name it *Passing* (逝)—
Passing, like the movement of going,
Cannot be pursued or chased.
*Passing* is still insufficient,
So I force another name upon it—*Distant*.
Distant—it cannot be approached or clung to.
*Distant* is still insufficient,
So I force another name upon it—*Returning*.
Returning—it means returning to the root.

**Master Li** said:
*Great*—without bounds or measure,
*Passing*—without territory or frontier,
*Distant*—without limits or edge,
*Returning*—it gathers and brings back.

**Master He** said:
*Returning*—it means returning to the state of no-thing.

**Master Chái** said:
*Returning*—it means the Dao’s use returning to its original body.

Hence:
The Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The Sage is also great.
Within the realm, there are four *Great Ones*,
And the Sage is one of them.

**Master Wu** said:
The Sage refers to those who hold the position of enlightenment.
Though the Dao is the greatest of all time,
Nothing can compare to it.
This is why, when speaking of heaven, earth, and the Sage in relation to the Dao,
It is said there are four *Great Ones*—why?

Because:
Heaven obtains this Dao and thus becomes heaven,
Earth obtains this Dao and thus becomes earth,
The Sage obtains this Dao and thus becomes the Sage.
This is how they become great—
Because they possess this Dao.

**Master Li** said:
Humans only know of the four *Great Ones* within the realm,
But do not realize that their own self is even greater.

**Master Lü** said:
The perfected one likens it to oneself.
The Dao is the numinous and mysterious void,
Heaven is the *Shén gōng* (神宫) of the celestial valley,
Earth is the *Zhēn tǔ* (真土) of the Yellow Court,
The Sage is the *Yuán shén* (元神) of true nature.
The *Yuán shén*—this is the heart,
Never departing from the four-square inch space.
Penetrating heaven and earth,
Spanning all directions—
This too can be called *Great*.

Humans follow Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows *Zìrán* (自然).

**Master Lü** said:
The Sage is profound and silent, like stillness,
Sharing virtue with the *Yīn* (阴).
In governing, it shows no partiality—
This is following Earth.
Earth is steadfast and unchanging,
Firm yet balanced, like the center,
Sharing movement with the *Yáng* (阳).
This is following Heaven.
Heaven is exalted and just,
Revealing true signs of the Sage,
Responding to all transformations,
Yet only virtue aids it—
This is following the Dao.
Only the Dao lets things follow their nature,
Achieving effortless spontaneity.
Hold fast without losing it,
And it merges with the numinous.
The Dao’s body is complete and free-flowing,
Entering and exiting without hindrance—
This is what is meant by *Zìrán*.
Who could say it is not so?
Thus it is said: *"Humans follow Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows Zìrán."*

**Master Wu** said:
The reason humans are great
Is because they obtain this Dao and align with Earth—
Hence, *"follow Earth."*
The reason Earth is great
Is because it obtains this Dao and aligns with Heaven—
Hence, *"follow Heaven."*

---

Heaven’s greatness lies in its unity with the Dao—
Hence, *"follow the Dao."*
The Dao’s greatness lies in its *Zìrán*—
Hence, *"follow Zìrán."*
There is no *Zìrán* apart from the Dao—
*Zìrán* is simply the nameless.

**Master Lin** said:
Its meaning is only that the Dao reaches its utmost in *Zìrán*—
Such an exposition may be called a profound theory.

**Master He** said:
The "humans follow Earth" refers to the Sage.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**
The heavy is the root of the light,
The still is the sovereign of the restless.
Thus the Sage never walks a day without his baggage train.

**Master Wu** said:
*Root* is like *foundation*; *restless* means *movement*.
*Sovereign* means *master*—
Speaking of the light relying on the heavy as its foundation,
And movement being governed by stillness as its master.

The Sage’s journey:
When traveling in peace, he rides in a light carriage,
When leading an army, he rides in a war chariot—
Both are light vehicles.
Behind the light carriage comes the baggage train,
Carrying bedding, clothing, food, and supplies—
This is the heavy carriage.

Though he rides in a light carriage,
He never strays from the heavy baggage train all day,
Not daring to rush forward in his light carriage
And abandon what follows behind.

This is what is meant by *"the light rooted in the heavy."*

**Master Lü** said:
The heavy is what bears things,
The light is what is borne by things.
To govern the light, one must not lose sight of the heavy.
The still is what commands things,
The restless is what is enslaved by things.
To govern the restless, one must not lose sight of the still.
For stillness brings the power to control the light,
And stillness provides the means to restrain the restless.
Thus, the ruler of a state
Should establish depth, weight, and tranquility as his foundation,
Then the people will be at ease without fear of disorder.

Even as he walks all day,
He never dares to leave behind the heavy baggage train—
For it contains his clothing and food.
If he abandons it and strays far,
He risks exhaustion along the way.
How could one, in establishing oneself and following the Dao,
For even an instant forget stillness and weight?

The Perfect Man, in his own conduct,
Holds weight and stillness in highest regard,
And carefully avoids lightness and restlessness.
The heavy is the head,
The light is the limbs,
The still is the spirit,
The restless is the emotions.
Taking the virtue of stillness and weight,
And discarding the emotions of lightness and restlessness,
Then the sacred embryo rests in ease,
And all day long, he moves as if riding in a comfortable carriage.

Though the Great Dao is smooth,
He does not dare to rush forward lightly.

**Master Lin** said:
*Root* speaks of the light arising from the heavy,
*Sovereign* speaks of the restless being mastered by stillness.
Though there are splendid sights to observe,
His dwelling is serene and detached.

**Master Wu** said:
*Burn* means *leisure*; *dwelling* means *residence*.
Even in realms of honor and splendor,
Where one might wander in observation,
He remains detached, untethered by any concern—
This is what is meant by *"movement governed by stillness."*

**Master Lin** said:
What his mind perceives
Is the utmost beauty in all under Heaven—
Hence, *"splendid sights."*
Yet he resides in it with ease,
Thus standing beyond lightness, heaviness, restlessness, and stillness.
*Burn* means *ease*; *dwelling* means *residence*—
As in my writings: *"ease in movement, breadth in dwelling."*

**Master He** said:
Though there are towering heights and splendid sights,
His leisure is serene and unburdened—
Nothing in all things can disturb his mind.
What more is there to governing the world?

The *Listed Child* observed the Dao without seeing—
The utmost of stillness and weight.
How could a ruler of ten thousand chariots
Make his body light to the world?
Lightness leads to losing his ministers,
Restlessness leads to losing his sovereignty.

**Master Wu** said:
The state’s power rests on the heavy governing the light,
Military strategy relies on stillness overcoming movement—
Just as in a person’s cultivation of body and mind,
One must root oneself in the heavy
And govern with stillness.

**Master Lin** said:
If a ruler of ten thousand chariots
Does not know his own weight,
He cannot stand detached from things.
He will inevitably fall into lightness and restlessness.
Losing his ministers means he cannot subdue the world,
Losing his sovereignty means he has abandoned what he governs—
To make his body light to the world
Is to treat the world as heavy and himself as light.
Not to make his body light is to know the Dao,
And to know the Dao is to know *Zìrán*.

**Master Lü** said:
For the Perfect Man, taking from himself—
The heart is the sovereign,
*Qi* is the minister.
Lightness causes the heart to move and deplete his *qi*,
Restlessness causes *qi* to dissipate and unsettle the heart.
Internally, he cultivates himself;
Externally, he commands things.
The body of stillness and weight,
The division of nature and principle—
Thus it is said: *"Lightness leads to losing his ministers,
Restlessness leads to losing his sovereignty."*

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**
The adept’s path leaves no tracks,
The adept’s speech has no flaws,
The adept’s strategy requires no calculations,
The adept’s closure needs no locks yet cannot be opened,
The adept’s binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone.

**Master Wu** said:
*"Shàn"* means to excel in one’s affairs.
*"Zhé"* refers to the tracks of a chariot.
*"Jì"* means footprints.
*"Xiá"* means flaws or blemishes.
*"Zhé"* means blameworthy errors.
*"Jì"* means the counting of numbers.
*"Chóucè"* are counting rods—calculating tools made of bamboo.
*"Guānjué"* are door-blocking bars: the horizontal piece is called *guān*, the vertical *jué*.
*"Shéngyuē"* means cords: when twisted together they form a rope (*shéng*), when used to bind things they are called *yuē*.

The traveler must leave tracks upon the earth,
The speaker must have flaws that can be pointed to,
The calculator must use counting rods,
The door-closer must use bars,
The binder must use cords.
Yet these are the deeds of ordinary men.
But when the Daoist observes them,
How could they be called *shàn*?

Indeed, the one who excels in movement
Does so by *not* moving and thus leaves no tracks.
The one who excels in speech
Does so by *not* speaking and thus has no flaws.
The one who excels in calculation
Does so by *not* calculating and thus needs no rods.
The one who excels in closing
Does so by *not* closing and thus has no bars—yet what is closed cannot be opened.
The one who excels in binding
Does so by *not* binding and thus has no cords—yet what is bound cannot be undone.

These five matters are used as analogies
To introduce the idea of the Sage’s excellence in salvation.

**Master Lü** said:
The numinous has no fixed form,
The Dao has no fixed body.
It arrives without movement,
It is swift without haste.
The Perfect Man observes the Dao of Heaven,
Follows Heaven’s actions,
Acts through *wuwei* (non-action),
Moves where nothing moves,
Yet without leaving his courtyard,
His virtue spreads and permeates—
Like wind sweeping through all things,
What tracks could there be to follow?

Moreover, those who cannot speak well
Are burdened by their words,
For it is clear they have not forgotten speech.
Flaws are the defects of jade,
Errors are the faults of speech—
How could they know the purpose of speech?
The Perfect Man, with his virtue of daily renewal,
Expresses himself in teaching the world,
Harmonizing with *Zìrán*,
So how could there be flaws or blame to mar him?
Thus it is said: *"The adept’s path leaves no tracks,
The adept’s speech has no flaws."*

The Dao cannot be sought through measurements.
Now, if one uses counting rods to know,
How could it be the self-attained mystery?
But the adept in calculation is otherwise:
Guarding the One in *wuwei*,
He can embrace all things,
Moving freely without falling into numbers,
Letting great and small, many and few,
Each fulfill their proper measure,
Without waste or loss—
What need has he for counting rods?
Thus it is said: *"The adept’s strategy requires no calculations."*

Moreover, the adept in closing
Has six openings and four exits,
Yet even if Heaven and Earth shift in secrecy,
Ghosts and spirits respond in vain—
They cannot find the door,
Nor enter by any means.
For his form is whole, his essence restored,
His orifices sealed, his gates closed—
No realm can penetrate.
Though no bars are used, it cannot be opened.
Thus it is said: *"The adept’s closure needs no locks yet cannot be opened."*

Ah! The adhesion of glues, the congealing of water,
The merging of affairs—
Even without cords, they cannot be undone.
The Perfect Man is simple, empty, and boundless,
His spirit concentrated, his *qi* settled,
Serene and tranquil—
Even Heaven and Earth cannot violate him.
Thus it is said: *"The adept’s binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone."*

**Master Li** said:
If one is careful in speech and action,
There will be no tracks, no blame.
The calculations of the heart—
Can they be reckoned?
The closures of the heart—
Can they be opened?
The bindings of the heart—
Can they be undone?

**Master Lin** said:
These five are all metaphors.
Their meaning is simply this:
If one takes *Zìrán* as the Dao,
There is no force to contain it,
No place to advance it.
Thus the Sage always excels in salvation,
And so there is no abandonment of people.
He always excels in saving things,
And so there is no abandonment of things—
This is called *"clinging to the bright."*

**Master Wu** said:
The Sage’s salvation of people and things
Is to *not* save as salvation—
Just as in the earlier analogies,
To excel is to *not* do the deed.

Indeed, where there is salvation,
There must be abandonment.
Suppose the Sage saves a hundred thousand people,
A hundred thousand things—
Yet outside that number,
All are abandoned and unsaved.
But the Sage’s excellence in salvation is otherwise:
He saves none at all.
If he saves none,
Then he abandons none.
One does not see him saving this while abandoning that,
So there is no one abandoned and unsaved,
No thing abandoned and unsaved.

**Master He** said:
The Dao pervades the world,
Encompassing all things.
All desire to be transformed by it,
All desire to be completed by it—
Yet no tracks are seen,
For its response is numinous and wondrous.

From the *Guān Yīn Zǐ*:
*"Dark and dense within the Great Transformation,
Nature is One alone.*
He who knows that Nature is One
Has no self, no other—
Thus all things fulfill their nature without remainder,
The Sage’s Dao of *wuwei*—
This is called *clinging to the bright.*"

The luminous and clear nature
Is what all share,
Yet it is not fully bright.
The Sage guides them with flexibility,
Restoring their luminous Heaven
To an unbroken, undying state—
Those who follow are the *shàn* (excellents),
Thus it is called *clinging to the bright.*

**Master Lü** said:
The Perfect Man withdraws his gaze, returns his hearing,
The empty chamber gives birth to whiteness,
The settled space emits light—
Like a lamp’s brilliance,
Transmitted without end,
Thus it is called *clinging to the bright.*

**Master Dòng** said:
To rescue people in peril
Is only to rescue their forms—
And even then, it may not be comprehensive.
How could this be called *shàn*?

Only those who cling to *wuwei*,
Lost in their nature’s darkness,
While I possess the capacity to contain them—
I envelop them with my prior enlightenment,
Awaken them so their Heavenly light shines forth,
Like a lamp’s transmission without end—
The more I give to others, the more my own brightness grows,
Boundless in measure.
Thus the *shàn* become teachers for the un-*shàn*,
And the un-*shàn* become resources for the *shàn.*

**Master Wu** said:
The *shàn* are those who excel in their affairs.
A *teacher* is one whom others revere and follow as a model.
A *resource* is like wealth given to others,
So they may rely on it and achieve success.

Because of their lack of virtue, others attain my reputation for virtue—
thus it is called *resource*.

**Master He** said:
The un-virtuous learn from the virtuous and receive their teachings,
while the virtuous use the un-virtuous as a means to manifest their transformation—
this is how the Dao endlessly generates and sustains itself.
This is called *transmitting brightness*.

**Master Lin** said:
If there were no un-virtuous in the world,
who would know the virtuous for their virtue?
Thus, the un-virtuous are the *resource* for the virtuous.
*Resource* means relying on them to distinguish oneself.

**Master Lü** said:
*Teacher* and *resource* are those who aid others and are also aided in return—
a reciprocal relationship.

**Master Ni** said:
That the virtuous are teachers to the un-virtuous is certain,
but that the un-virtuous are *resources* for the virtuous—
Confucius said:
*"When three men walk together, there is one I can take as my teacher.
I follow his virtues and correct my flaws."*
Even Confucius regarded the un-virtuous as teachers.
How much more so for the wise?

*Resource* means *aid*—
by observing their flaws, I reflect and correct my errors to follow virtue.
This is called *resource*.

To not esteem one’s teacher,
to not cherish one’s *resource*—
even the wise may be utterly lost.
This is called the *ultimate subtlety*.

**Master Lü** said:
Though one follows a teacher to find direction,
upon sudden enlightenment to the ultimate truth,
subject and object are forgotten—
neither esteem nor attachment remains.
As in Liezi, who taught by Lao Shang and befriended Boyao,
later saying:
*"I do not know if my teacher was truly my teacher,
or if my friend was truly my friend—
within and without, all is complete."*
Thus it is said:
To not esteem one’s teacher,
to not cherish one’s *resource*—
only then can one perceive the nature of nature,
open the Heaven of Heaven,
and penetrate deeply into the Dao,
so that even the wise are utterly lost in its crossing.
Though they devise clever schemes, they find no application;
though they speak profound words, they find no understanding.
This is truly the *ultimate subtlety*—
thus it is said:
Even the wise may be utterly lost,
this is called the *ultimate subtlety*.

**Master Li** said:
Forgetting teacher and *resource*,
discarding cleverness and abandoning wisdom,
acting the fool all day.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**
Know the *heroic* yet hold to the *receptive*—
be the valley of the world.

To be the valley of the world,
ever abiding in virtue,
returning to the infant.

**Master Lü** said:
The *heroic* is strong and active,
the *receptive* is gentle and still.
The sage knows his own exalted dignity—
if he indulges in rigid dominance, calamity arises.
Better to embrace the yielding and weak,
to be humble and good at submission,
so that the world’s virtue returns to him,
like water flowing downward.

To be the valley of the world,
overflowing like a gentle stream,
spreading to the four directions—
what cannot it receive?
Yet still maintaining his constant virtue,
pure and unadulterated,
like an infant before speech—
this is called *perfect virtue*.
So too for oneself.

The *heroic* is the yang within yin,
in man, the *essence*.
The *receptive* is the yin within yang,
in man, the *spirit*.
Knowing the *heroic* preserves one’s essence,
holding to the *receptive* nurtures one’s spirit.
When the spirit is luminous, all things come;
when the heart is empty, harmonious *qi* returns—
like water flowing into a valley,
bearing all filth,
comparable to the innocence of a babe.

**Master Wu** said:
*Heroic* means strong and forceful,
*receptive* means gentle and weak,
*infant* means without knowledge.

**Master Lin** said:
The word *know* implies action without action—
knowing the *heroic* yet holding to the *receptive* is not seeking victory.

*Constant virtue* is the *constant Way*—
*not departing* means without interruption.
*Infant*—without knowledge.

**Master Li** said:
Knowing the *heroic* yet holding to the *receptive* is not arrogance.

**Master He** said:
When the Heavenly gates open and close,
can one truly be *receptive*?
I would rather remain still and humble—
weakness overcomes strength.

**Master Ni** said:
First, one must *know* the *heroic*,
then speak of holding to the *receptive*—
it is not that one does not know the *heroic*’s strength,
but that one can embrace the *receptive*’s gentleness—
this is what is precious.
If one only knew the *heroic* and held to the *receptive* without understanding,
even the world’s foolish and weak could claim to know the Way—
how could this be?

Thus, one must first know and yet be able to refrain—
this is the mark of the *Daoist*.

The *infant* is a metaphor for the beginning of the Way.

---
Know the *bright* yet hold to the *dark*—
be the model of the world.

To be the model of the world,
ever abiding in constant virtue without error,
returning to the *Unbounded*.

**Master Lü** said:
*Bright* illustrates the Dao’s manifestation,
*dark* illustrates its return.
The sage knows his heart is pure and unblemished,
wise yet not acting—
only then can he embrace its depths,
holding wisdom like foolishness,
concealing his light like darkness,
applying it to himself and others,
becoming the world’s model.
Once established as the standard and measure,
upright yet not arbitrary,
public yet not partial,
acting with constancy—
no deviation or fault remains.
In the body, *bright* is the metal’s domain,
*dark* is the water’s reservoir.
Knowing metal and water generate and complete each other,
as the foundation of life,
one must refine the elixir,
preserve the primordial essence,
circulate and transform—
achieving the true body,
becoming the world’s model for cultivation.
Moreover, the constant virtue is self-aware and effortless,
direct and comprehensive—
no flaw, no error,
spirit in perfect accord—
how could it ever be exhausted?
Thus it is said:
*Bright* illustrates clarity,
*dark* illustrates silence.
Though one knows one’s own clarity,
one must also hold to silence.
Like darkness with nothing to see,
thus becoming the world’s model—
virtue remains constant.

**Master He** said:
Do not tread upon the *bright*—
this ensures eternal preservation.
I would rather take the *dark* as virtue,
making clarity like obscurity.

**Master Wu** said:
*Bright* means luminous,
*dark* means obscure,
*Unbounded*—without limit.

**Master Li** said:
Those who know the *bright* yet hold to the *dark*—
they do not reveal themselves.
Those who know their *honor* yet hold to their *humiliation*—
they become the world’s *valley*.

As the world’s *valley*,
constant virtue is then complete—
returning to the *Uncarved*.

**Master Lü** said:
The coming of *honor* and *humiliation* is beyond human foresight,
yet they arrive and depart as they will.
At first, there is no entanglement.
The Sage knows the exalted station of their place—
to bask in *honor* yet guard against *humiliation*,
to accept filth and conceal stains,
like the *valley*’s emptiness.
When the *valley* is empty,
nothing is excluded—
no distinction between self and other,
inner virtue overflowing,
one nature pure and unchanging—
returning to the *Uncarved*.

**Master Li** said:
To know *honor* yet hold to *humiliation*—
this is not to exalt oneself.
To guard the *female* and embrace the *dark*—
this is not to reveal one’s own clarity.

**Master He** said:
The greatest *bright* is like *humiliation*,
the most *virtue* is like insufficiency—
I would rather endure filth and misfortune,
for loss brings gain.
The terms *infant* (*婴儿*), *Unbounded* (*无极*), and *Uncarved* (*朴*)—
all speak of the Dao’s return to its origin.

**Master Lin** said:
*Complete* refers to fullness,
*Uncarved* is the *Great Uncarved* (*太朴*)—
the beginning of heaven and earth.

**Master Wu** said:
*Honor* means exalted nobility,
*humiliation* means lowly abasement,
*Uncarved* means raw wood yet to become a vessel.
The meaning of this passage is to preserve constant virtue
and return to the original, beginningless Dao.
Constant virtue is the virtue of *effortless emptiness*—
thus, one prefers the *dark* over the *bright*,
the *female* over the *male*,
*humiliation* over *honor*.
Those who know and uphold it,
though aware of the other’s worth,
yet choose to guard and remain in the lowly—
when they fully embody this *effortless emptiness*,
they may return to the beginningless Dao.
As *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Virtue reaches its peak when it aligns with the original"*—
the terms *Unbounded*, *infant*, and *Uncarved*
all illustrate the beginningless Dao.
When the *Uncarved* is dispersed, it becomes vessels—
the Sage employs it,
and thus becomes the *official* of heaven and earth.
Hence, the great *measure* does not *sever*.

**Master Lin** said:
The *Great Uncarved* is dispersed, and only then do vessels arise—
what is beyond form is called *Dao*,
what is beneath form is called *vessel*.
The Sage uses the *Dao* beyond form to govern what is beneath form,
and thus all things between heaven and earth fulfill their roles.
The Sage governs the Three Powers to command all things—
though their duties overlap,
they still obey my will—
this is the *official* of all things between heaven and earth.
As *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The Sage manages the roles of heaven and earth"*—
this is merely one aspect of the *Dao*’s governance.
*Sever* means *to divide*—
to govern things with the *Dao* is called the *great measure*,
and when measured, *Dao* and *vessel* do not separate—
this is the meaning of *acting without action*,
*effortless naturalness*.

**Master He** said:
The *Uncarved* is the origin of the *Dao*’s effortlessness,
the *vessel* is the name for things that are shaped by effort.
The Sage cannot prevent the *Uncarved* from becoming vessels,
yet skillfully employs them
to manage the roles of heaven and earth,
to lead the people and command all things—
though the *great measure* governs,
it does not *sever*—
it nurtures without harming,
the power of the *Dao* itself.

**Master Wu** said:
Where there is governance, one must use a blade to divide the whole—
yet the *great measure* governs by not governing,
thus it does not *sever*.
The *great scattering* is not scattering,
the *great use* is not using—
this is also like the *great measure*’s non-*severance*.

**Chapter XXIX**
When one seeks to take the world yet acts upon it,
I see their necessity as inevitable.
The world is a *divine vessel*—
it cannot be shaped.
Those who shape it will ruin it,
those who grasp it will lose it.

**Master He** said:
The scriptures speak of three warnings against the world—
to awaken the hearts of traitorous ministers and rebellious officials across ten thousand generations,
those who are blind to *authority* and *right*,
who transgress order and seize power recklessly,
who externally overestimate their strength,
yet internally fail to grasp *command*—
these are those who bring their own destruction,
and I show them their calamity as a warning.
Thus it is said:
*"Take the world by doing nothing"*—
do not harbor even a speck of *action* in your heart.
The world is a *great thing*, a *divine vessel*—
not something human strength can covet.
As King Wen held two-thirds of the world,
how could he ever have had the heart to *take* it?
As Yao’s *yellow house* was not his own doing,
and Shun and Yu ruled the world yet did not claim it—
how could they ever have had the heart to *grasp* it?

**Master Lü** said:
The Sage’s possession of the world is not *taking*—
their governance of the world is not *doing*.
Why so?
Because they never had the heart to *take* or *do*.
Thus they could harmonize with the world’s constant *Dao*,
assist in the natural unfolding of all things—
all things return to them,
not out of necessity, but willingly.
If one harbors the heart to *take* and *act* upon the world,
will they not rely on cleverness and force,
contradicting the *Dao* and losing its natural order?
The *divine vessel* is the supreme treasure,
the domain of heaven and earth’s *divine brilliance*—
it commands all existence,
subdues all movement—
indeed, it cannot be shaped.
If one pursues their own private gain,
interfering in the world’s affairs,
bound by things and claiming them as their own,
acting without knowing when to stop—
they will enter the realm of *worry* and *calamity*,
not only losing the highest truth,
but also their own authenticity—
why bother governing the world at all?
The human heart encompasses all the world’s marvels—
what is prized is its *naturalness*.
Once one acts upon it,
they can no longer remain *without action*—
humanity extinguishes the *Dao*,
reverence destroys *command*—
the *Dao* becomes even more unattainable.
In its original form,
it mirrors heaven and earth,
harmonizes with yin and yang—
this is the *divine vessel*.
The Yellow Emperor gazed southward and lost the *dark pearl*—
the seven orifices were pierced, and *Chaos* died—
this is the *Dao*’s unshapability.
Those who *shape* it desire its completion,
thus they ruin it.
Those who *grasp* it desire its possession,
thus they lose it.
If one remains *without action*, they will not ruin it—
if one does not *grasp*, they will not lose it—
thus they attain the *Dao*!

The **Li Family** says:
*"To act is to have affairs; not to act is to have no affairs. Those who grasp lose; those who act fail—this is the warning against action."*

The **Lin Family** says:
*"The divine vessel of the world—
how can it be attained by human strength?
When the Dao flourishes and virtue reaches its peak,
the world submits to it.
If one harbors the intention to seize the world and forcefully do good,
seeking to gain something,
then the unattainable becomes even more so.
For all things under heaven,
one must not seek them with intention.
Those who act will fail;
those who grasp will lose—
these are the burdens of intention.
All things either move forward or follow,
either warm with breath or chill with wind,
either prevail with strength or falter with weakness,
either succeed with elevation or collapse with ruin.
Thus, the Sage avoids excess,
avoids extravagance,
avoids extravagance—
this is the **He Family**’s teaching:
*What is lost to one is gained by another;
what is completed here is deficient there.
Loss and gain, completion and deficiency—
they cycle endlessly, as in the *Liezi*’s parable:
the praying mantis seizes the cicada,
unaware of the sparrow behind.
Thus, when one moves forward, another follows;
when one breathes warmth, another blows cold;
when one prevails with strength, another weakens it;
when one succeeds with elevation, another ruins it—
they guard each other like shadows to form,
like things guarding things.
How much more so the world, greater than all things,
can one have intention, action, or grasping?
Excess is overreaching—
the Dao takes weakness as its standard,
emptiness as its substance,
and avoids overreaching—
thus, to remove excess is to eliminate frivolous waste.
The Dao takes origin as its refinement,
things as its coarseness—
extravagance leads to insolence,
thus, to remove extravagance is to eliminate arrogant excess.
The Dao takes depth as its root,
simplicity as its measure,
and does not consider the world as extravagant—
thus, to remove extravagance is to avoid arrogance.
These three are all the extravagant hearts of action;
removing these three,
the Sage’s heart is empty—
the world cannot disturb it."*

The **Li Family** says:
*"Strength and weakness, elevation and ruin—
they mutually rely and overturn each other,
like shadows following form.
Where there is success, there is also failure—
thus, the Sage avoids greed for excess,
avoids extravagance,
avoids arrogance and extravagance,
and deeply warns future generations."*

The **Su Family** says:
*"Some move forward, some follow behind;
some breathe warmth, some blow cold;
some strengthen and benefit, some weaken and diminish;
some succeed with elevation, some ruin with collapse—
these are the natural ways of things,
inevitable forces that cannot be avoided."*

The **Wu Family** says:
*"This follows the earlier warning: *‘Those who grasp lose.’*
The Way of governing the world—
those who hold the world,
how can they long preserve it as their own without losing it?
The cycles of gain and loss, survival and ruin,
are like moving forward and following,
breathing warmth and blowing cold,
strength and weakness,
elevation and ruin—
these eight opposites interdependently arise.
The Sage knows these forces must reach this point,
and thus has a Way to respond.
All that is overabundant must decline—
only by preventing overabundance
can one avoid decline.
If one does not exceed in greed, extravagance, or arrogance,
then at the peak of abundance,
one can preserve the world.
*The Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing*, Volume Four concludes.
Volume Five begins."*

**Chapter Thirty: Those Who Assist the Sovereign with the Dao Do Not Use Military Might to Subdue the World**

Their affairs tend to return.

**Master Lü** says:
Those of the Dao who assist their sovereign must first establish virtue as their foundation. Armies and weapons are but the final means. The sovereign governs ministers with propriety, and ministers serve the sovereign with loyalty. If the ruler acts without artifice, the people transform themselves spontaneously. The common folk flourish in harmony, unaware of imperial might, yet they engage in warfare—how can this be the Dao?

War is an omen of calamity, and battle is a perilous affair. It is not the instrument of the virtuous. Used only when unavoidable, victory brings defeat, and gain brings harm. How can one justly subdue the weak or violently oppress the good? When beasts are cornered, they strike back; when things reach their extreme, they reverse. This is inevitable.

**Master Ni** says:
It does not say *"the sovereign"* but *"those who assist the sovereign with the Dao,"* meaning that even if the sovereign harbors intentions of war, if the great ministers do not comply, he may not necessarily act upon them.

**Master Lin** says:
To assist the sovereign while prioritizing military strength is not to know the Dao. War is a cruel instrument—if I harm others, others will harm me in return. Thus, it is said that such affairs tend to return.

**Master Wang** says:
Those who assist the sovereign with the Dao still refrain from using military might to subdue the world—how much more so should the sovereign himself, who embodies the Dao?

Where the teacher treads, brambles grow.
After great armies pass, there will surely be years of famine.

**Master Lü** says:
Where armies have marched, both ancient and modern battlefields, few reap lasting benefit. Fields lie fallow, homes stand empty, and brambles thrive—how can one not fear this?

When great armies march, they disrupt the natural order above and drain the people’s strength below. Harmonious *qi* fails to ascend, and killing *qi* floods below. Both people and things suffer violence. The six *qi* become unbalanced, and rain and sun lose their proper timing. Plagues and disasters follow, and famine ensues after war—this is the natural course.

**Master Su** says:
Where war is waged, civil affairs falter, and fields lie untended. After battle, killing *qi* surges, and crops wither.

**Political Harmony Annotation**:
The people’s strength is drained below, hence brambles grow. The natural order is disrupted above, hence years of famine follow.

**Master Lin** says:
In lands where armies are deployed, farmers cannot till the soil, and brambles arise. After war, the harmony of Heaven and Earth is wounded, and years of famine inevitably follow. Thus, the virtuous act decisively but do not seek strength. Act decisively without arrogance, without boasting, without pride—act only when unavoidable, and do not seek strength.

**Master Lü** says:
Though military strength and victory in battle are methods to suppress violence and quell disorder, they must not be discarded—like water and fire, their proper use brings blessing, but misuse brings ruin. Those who skillfully wield arms act decisively but do not seek strength. What virtue cannot transform and what governance cannot reach must be addressed only when unavoidable, pressed only when necessary. When they act, they do so without fail, not relying on strength to take what is not theirs. This is the clear path of virtuous victory.

Act decisively without boasting of your ability—for boasting leads to decline.
Act decisively without praising your virtue—for praise undermines true merit.
Act decisively without growing proud of your power—for pride leads to insufficiency.

Matters of aggression may be addressed, but not to seek strength.

**Master He** says:
Virtue lies not in waging war but in wielding it well. By *"decisive"* (*guǒ*), he means clarity of vision and firm resolve. Decisiveness is secondary to doing good, not to wielding arms for conquest. As the *Classic* says: *"The contest is of heart and strength."* Thus, one acts decisively but does not seek strength. Again, it says: *"Act decisively but do not seek strength."*

To not boast of ability, not to praise one’s deeds, not to grow arrogant—these are the expressions of a virtuous heart. Thus, one acts with decisive resolve, not competing in heart. Only in the matter of extreme military strength does one act decisively to reject it, not competing in force.

**Master Dong** says:
Though the Dao rejects war, Heaven endows the five elements, which cannot be discarded—like water and fire, their proper use is essential. Only when used to suppress violence and aid the distressed does decisiveness follow principle. Whatever principles and righteousness belong to us, we uphold them without bending.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *"Decisive action means killing enemies to prevent mutual aggression—how dare one seek strength over the world?"*

Decisive action wins through principle; strength wins through force. Decisiveness carries an inherent certainty of victory, yet it does not rely on force or delight in war. Thus, when facing matters, one fears, plans carefully, and acts only when unavoidable—simply avoiding strength.

When things reach their peak, they decline—this is called *not the Dao*. *Not the Dao* must be abandoned early.

**Master Lin** says:
The strong cannot remain strong, the arrogant cannot remain arrogant. Just as all things, once at their peak, must decline—those who do not understand this principle yet seek to dominate the world are acting against the Dao. Knowing this, they must swiftly abandon it. *"Early abandonment"* means to cease and not persist.

**Master Su** says:
Things grow strong, then decline—none escape this. Only those of the Dao, though complete, appear deficient; though full, appear empty. They never grow strong, never decline, never die. To use military might to subdue the world is extreme strength—how can it avoid decline?

**Master He** says:
Why does the Sage retreat in humility, unwilling to seek victory over the world? Because He sees that when the sun reaches its zenith, it declines; when the moon is full, it wanes; when things reach their peak, decline follows. Is this not the natural course of the Dao? If one knows this is not the Dao, then one must swiftly return to it, swiftly abandon what is not the Dao. The causes of ruined states are many, but those who delight in arms are doomed to fall.

With the Dao to govern the people and the state, how could one not take the use of arms as a warning and skillfully employ their consequences?

**Master Dong** says:
When things reach their peak of strength, they grow old; when arms are at their strongest, they meet defeat. Thus, those who rely on military might cannot fully preserve their virtue in victory. To employ strength is precisely what hastens decay and decline—all of which are contrary to the Dao. One should know when to stop early.

**Chapter Thirty-One**
Fine arms are instruments of ill omen. People detest them, and thus those who follow the Dao do not wield them.

**Master Lin** says:
Fine arms mean delighting in warfare, taking pleasure in using arms—this is the nature of an ill-omened person. An ill-omened person engaging in ill-omened deeds makes arms an ill-omened instrument, which the world detests. Hence, those who follow the Dao do not use them.

**Master Li** says:
Not using arms to subdue the world, those who rank arms as ill-omened instruments—this is the Sage’s profound warning to all future rulers of states. With non-action, purity, and tranquil governance, the realm naturally attains peace. Though arms exist, they are not displayed, and the scourge of contention is forever averted.

**Master Lü** says:
Arms are not tools for achieving great peace and governance. Though they may be used to punish tyranny, if one is forced to employ them, how can one avoid dark machinations? Those who adorn themselves with weapons as ornaments are already indulging in their cruelest use. This is to glorify a deadly instrument and hope for the world’s blessing—it is not only hated by people but also feared by all things.

The *Continuation of the Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government* records that Song Emperor Taizong said to his close ministers:
*"When I read in Laozi that ‘Fine arms are instruments of ill omen,’ and that the Sage uses them only when unavoidable, I have never failed to reflect on this as a solemn warning three times over.*

*The virtuous in repose honor the left; in war, they honor the right.*

*Arms are instruments of ill omen, not the tools of the virtuous. Used only when unavoidable, tranquility is supreme.*

*To win yet not take pride in it, yet to take pride is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world.*

**Master Lin** says:
The virtuous always honor the left in repose, yet in war, they honor the right—this shows that even the ancients regarded arms as ill-omened deeds, not something the virtuous would willingly use. They are employed only when unavoidable. Even if forced to wage war, they hold tranquility in highest regard. Tranquility is without relish, signifying the unwillingness born of necessity. Though victorious, they do not rejoice. ‘Not taking pride’ means war is no good deed. If one takes pride in war, then killing becomes a delight—how could such a person ever fulfill their ambitions in the world? As *Mencius* says: ‘Those who do not delight in killing can unite the world.’ This is the same meaning.

**Master Lü** says:
The Dao of Heaven and Earth places yang on the left and yin on the right. Yang embodies virtue, life, and gentleness—thus, in repose, it is honored. Yin embodies punishment, killing, and strength—thus, in war, it is exalted.

**Master Wu** says:
Tranquility means without exultation; simplicity means without excess. To hold war in disdain is to govern supremely. Though victorious, they do not glory in it—war is no noble deed. If one glories in victory, then killing is their delight. Those who delight in killing cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world. This is the final admonition.

*Auspicious rites honor the left; inauspicious rites honor the right. The Assistant General stands to the left, the Commanding General to the right—this is to treat war as a funeral.*

*When many die, one mourns with tears. Victory in war is treated as a funeral.*

**Master Lin** says:
The Assistant General’s rank is subordinate to the Commanding General, yet here the Commanding General stands to the right while the Assistant General stands to the left—this shows the ancients treated war as an inauspicious affair, thus observing funeral rites. Left is yang, right is yin; funeral rites exalt yin. Even if victorious, one should treat it as mourning, weeping for the dead with sorrow. The intent of this chapter is that those who seek victory in life are doomed to misfortune, not blessed.

**Master He** says:
To treat victory as though it were defeat, observing funeral rites—this is the height of compassion. When the Qin army was defeated at Heng and retreated, the Duke of Qin wore mourning attire at the outskirts and wept toward the troops. This was fitting for defeat, but there has never been one who, upon victory, mourned in this way. Only those who deeply embody Heaven and Earth’s love for life and universal compassion could be moved to such grief.

Compassion makes one courageous; sorrow makes one victorious. The Dao resides here. But if one takes arms as fine, killing as delight, and victory as beautiful, then one does not know the Dao, one does not know Heaven.

**Chapter Thirty-Two**
The Dao is ever nameless. Though crude and seemingly small, the world dares not submit to it. If lords and kings can preserve it, all things will come of their own accord.

**Master Lü** says:
The Dao is difficult to speak of—it encompasses all things, penetrating the finest and the vast. How could it be named or compared to simplicity? Crude refers to its pure, unadulterated essence, one without mixture, boundless and all-pervading. Though called "small," it is not small in size, but in its formlessness, its non-action, its subtle and wondrous nature—beyond grasp or imitation. Thus, it is named "small."

All worldly tools and instruments, once named, are subject to the nameless. Only the Dao’s crudeness underpins all things—Heaven and Earth cannot violate it, sages and wise cannot interfere, and yet how could the world submit to it? If lords and kings preserve this crudeness, the world will naturally be governed.

To liken it to oneself: lords and kings are originally like unspoiled children. The unmanifest Heavenly Sovereign is called the Original Spirit. If one guards it without loss, one becomes one with the Spirit.

The Dao’s supreme constancy is unassailable—all ten thousand *qi* bow to it. Hence it is said: **"The Dao is ever nameless."**

Though *pu* (crudeness) is small, the world does not dare to subject itself to it.
If lords and kings can preserve this *pu*, all things will naturally submit.

**○ Master He says:** The phrase *"Dao is ever"* is a complete sentence, like *"Heaven is ever true"* or *"constancy is ever true"*—it means the eternal Dao.

The Great Dao is formless and nameless; yet, when forced to name it, we call it "Dao."
Its namelessness is the Dao’s eternal essence—*pu* itself.
All things that can be named or spoken of are not true constancy, but mere instruments.
Thus, it is said: **"Heaven and Earth, along with all sentient beings, are originally rooted in the Dao, all emerging from the primordial *Tai Su* (Great Substance), the initial stage of emptiness and nothingness."**

*Pu* is the Great Substance, the origin of the nameless.
Before differentiation into the myriad forms of existence, it alone remains within the Great Chaos.
*Pu* is subtle beyond measure—hard to know, hard to see—thus it is called "small."

The Sage discerns the root of constancy and *pu*, embraces the Substance while preserving *pu*.
This is simplicity in essence and ease in practice, few actions yet great achievements,
a heart of non-action, safeguarding the utmost rectitude.
The Dao is both empty and real, void yet present—
with it, one governs the heavy and light,
and may rule the world,
yet how could the world dare to subject itself to such governance?

With it, one dwells in stillness yet commands motion,
and may become the master of all things—
yet all things will naturally submit to such mastery.

**○ Master Li says:** *"The Dao is ever nameless"*—this is the natural state of emptiness and nothingness.
*Pu* is small, yet supremely subtle—
the world does not dare to subject itself to it, for it is the utmost reverence.
All things will naturally submit—none will resist.
**○ Master Lin says:** *"The Dao is ever nameless"*—
though it may be named as "extraordinary" or "nameless," the nameless *pu* is the Dao itself.
Though it seems the smallest, the world cannot but honor it—
who would dare to belittle it?
Thus, it is said: *"the world does not dare to subject itself to it."*

For those who become lords and kings,
if they can preserve this Dao,
then all things will naturally submit and serve them.

Heaven and Earth unite in harmony,
and sweet dew descends.
No one commands it,
yet all is balanced naturally.

**○ Master Lü says:** When Heaven and Earth interact, all things are born.
When human Dao interacts, achievements are fulfilled.
What then if the Sage acts,
and all things respond?
The harmonious *qi* silently aligns—
above, it reaches the Celestial Clarity (*Tai Qing*),
below, it coils around the Great Tranquility (*Tai Ning*).
It transforms into sweet dew,
nourishing all things.
Initially, none know who commands it,
yet it descends and ascends in perfect balance,
entering and exiting through the Mysterious Mother (*Xuan Mu*),
converging at the Yellow Court (*Huang Ting*).
Piercing this meaning,
one establishes the reversal of the infant.
**○ Master He says:** When the Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth in virtue,
timely rains descend and sweet springs flow—
the sweet dew may be attained.
When the Sage unites in heart with all beings,
teaching and transformation flourish,
customs shift—
the world does not await commands but naturally finds harmony.
Sweet dew is the auspicious response of kings—
refined as fat, sweet as honey,
received by pine and bamboo alike.
Because the Sage preserves *pu* in stillness and quietude,
the natural responses are thus.

**○ Master Li says:** When Heaven and Earth unite,
it is virtue alone that supports them,
and sweet dew descends from harmonious *qi*.
Their natural balance is the peace of harmony itself.

From the beginning, there was *pu* and the nameless.
Once names arise, one must know when to stop—
knowing when to stop ensures no peril.
**○ Master Lü says:** With seasons passing and years turning,
things manifest through their functions.
*Pu* differentiates into instruments,
names arise from these instruments.
Once distinctions are set,
rank and hierarchy appear—
one cannot transgress above or below.
If one does not know when to stop,
pursuing names while forgetting *pu*,
abandoning the root for the branches,
then one loses their foundation.

The wise who know when to stop
are both enlightened and sagely,
self-sufficient within,
requiring nothing from without—
how could they face danger or peril?

**○ Master Lin says:** The Dao’s origin is nameless.
Once the myriad things arise,
then the Dao’s name appears.
Creation itself is the scattering of *pu* into instruments.
This name having arisen,
one generates two, two generate three—
where does it end?

Those who know the Dao
must recognize this point and stop—
knowing when to stop ensures no peril.

**○ Master He says:** From the nameless to the named,
from the beginning to the mother—
within every scattering of *pu* into instruments,
there lies a supreme principle that cannot be severed.
Tracing the flow to its source,
exploring the root to its branches,
returning to the beginning while harmonizing,
erasing distinctions into formlessness,
preventing the loss of the Dao—
those who stray and forget return,
yet stopping is perilous, stopping is humiliation.
Thus, it is said: *"Once named, return to the Dao."*

Long-lasting achievements and virtue
bring lifelong freedom from blame—
thus, *"it cannot be named."*

The Dao’s initial stage may be named,
but those who know the Dao’s remainder
also grasp the Dao of the Primordial Beginning (*Yuan Shi*),
and those who know its remainder
align with the pivot of yin and yang—
mixing into one,
they may harmonize with Heaven and Earth.

**○ Master Wu says:** The "beginning" is the Dao,
"making" is creation—
just as one says "to do."
The "named" is virtue.
The Dao is nameless,
yet when it manifests as virtue,
then it is named.
The Dao’s nameless virtue becomes virtue—
once named, one must know when to stop at virtue,
and not descend further.
The intent of this passage is:
when one moves from nothingness to existence,
one must know to stop at virtue—
it cannot be furthered beyond this.

Below the named virtue,
one returns to the Dao and descends to virtue—
is this possible?
Knowing when to stop at virtue,
one is still not far from the Dao.

To liken the Dao in the world
to rivers and valleys compared to the sea.

**○ Master Lü says:** The Dao is the origin of all things,
rivers and valleys are the divisions of water,
the sea is the gathering of water.
Yet the Dao in the world—
above, it ascends to the Celestial Clarity (*Qing Du*) and Purple Micro (*Zi Wei*),
below, it mingles with the humble and the coarse.
Following it brings prosperity,
contradicting it brings ruin—
like the sea, it is compared to this.
If one does good,
it permeates and nourishes all things,
if one does evil,
it surges and brings calamity.
Yet the Dao grows ever higher the more it descends,
the sea grows ever fuller the more it is tilted.
The Sage’s virtue encompasses Heaven and Earth,
nourishment extends near and far—
then the people cannot but return to such virtue.

**○ Master Wu says:** The preceding text speaks of arising from Nonbeing to Being;
this now speaks of returning from Being to Nonbeing—
both must be understood in terms of the Dao.
For the Dao in the world is like the sea and rivers,
while virtue is like the tributaries converging into them.

**○ Master He says:** The Dao in the world
is like the sea receiving all rivers—
the sea does not desire the waters,
yet the waters naturally flow to it.
If one returns to simplicity and non-action,
the Dao is not sought,
yet it naturally comes—
effortless, not forced.
The Sage begins with silent stillness and non-action,
then transcends all entanglements of name and form.
His Dao endures through ten thousand ages without change—
truly, it is the Eternal Constant.

**○ Master Lin says:** The waters of rivers and valleys
must flow into the sea before they rest,
and all things under Heaven
must return to the Dao before they cease.
Thus it is said:
*The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the sea.*

**Chapter Thirty-Three**
*To know others is wisdom,*
*to know oneself is enlightenment.*

「Conquering others is strength,
but conquering oneself is power.
Master Lü says: Knowing others means seeking perfection in things,
controlling life through external means—
this is not as good as knowing oneself without knowing,
enlightening oneself without enlightenment,
which may truly be called **self-knowing** and **self-enlightenment**.
Those who strive externally conquer others with force,
but those who strive internally conquer themselves with the Dao.
To establish a state and proclaim a name,
to grasp authority and wield influence,
to command all under Heaven,
to subjugate the feudal lords—
is this not the use of force to conquer others?
The self-conqueror upholds **virtue/power** and **Dao**,
practices **ren** (benevolence) and **yi** (righteousness),
overcomes self to restore propriety,
humble and self-effacing—
yet people flock to him.
Thus, none under Heaven can conquer him;
what else could this be but **power**?

Master He says: By human nature,
one is clear in knowing others,
but dim in knowing oneself;
strong in conquering others,
but timid in conquering oneself.
So knowing others is merely discerning right and wrong,
advantage and harm—
yet a single moment of knowing wrong,
and the **spiritual radiance** (*lingguang*) ever shines forth,
this is the greatest **self-enlightenment**.
Conquering others is merely a matter of strength and weakness,
courage and cowardice—
yet a single moment of overcoming evil,
and this is the greatest courage under Heaven,
the greatest **self-power**.
How far removed this is from those who strive externally but neglect internally!

Master Wu says: Intelligence can know others,
but this is merely external knowledge.
To know oneself is to exhaust one’s nature internally,
thus called **enlightenment**.
To have strength and conquer others is to rely on external force,
but to conquer oneself is to internally overcome self,
thus called **power**.
The contented man is rich,
the resolute man acts with purpose.
The steadfast man endures long.
The man who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.

Master Lü says: The accomplished man’s work
endures after his death,
benefiting all people—
he does not lose his place,
nor forgets his roots,
his influence lasts far into the future,
so that later generations cannot emulate him.
In his body, he guards the **True One** (*Zhenyi*), embraces unity,
and is not swayed by external things,
never for an instant departing from it—
then he enters the realm of the **Eternal Constant** (*Zhenchang*),
enduring through all ages without change,
unified with the Dao,
thus it is said: *The steadfast man endures long.*
The Sage’s Dao is transmitted through ten thousand ages,
recorded in books and decrees,
later generations revere him as their teacher,
though his person may have passed,
his governance remains as if alive.
The man of the Dao regards life as a temporary dwelling,
and death as his final return—
in his life, he discerns the **tendencies** (*qù*) with clarity,
unified with the Dao in truth;
in his death, he sheds the mortal form and attains **spiritual transformation** (*shenhua*),
like a cicada casting its shell.
Though his body dies,
his true self does not perish—
his longevity matches the **Two Principles** (*Eryi*) in its boundless extent,
thus it is said: *The man who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.*

Master He says: **Self-enlightenment** through self-knowing is possible,
but one must also attain the **knowing of contentment** (*Zhizú*),
then wealth is not bound by the world—
his contentment is **Dao-contentment**, **spiritual-contentment**,
this is called **true knowing**.
To achieve **self-power** and conquer is possible,
but one must also attain **resolute action** (*Qiángxíng*),
then his purpose can overcome all things—
his actions are **diligent action**, **solitary action**,
this is called **true power**.
Thus, the two lines—**knowing of contentment** and **resolute action**—
are connected to the preceding lines on **knowing** and **power**,
and their meaning becomes clear.
**Longevity** lies in not losing one’s place—
the place is the destination of return,
as the *Yijing* says: *"The **stopping** (*Gèn*) Principle stops at its place,
and finds rest in its place"*—
it means that the power to stop is one who stops at its proper place.
All things and affairs have their proper place,
to find it is to be at ease,
thus **longevity**.
To lose it is to go astray;
how could it endure?
**Longevity** lies in death, not in perishing—
death is the meaning of finality,
as the *Liezi* says: *"The Dao is the source of eternal life,
from life comes life—
though it ends, it does not perish eternally."*
As the *Zhuangzi* says: *"A thousand years of life may weary one of the world,
and they depart to ascend as immortals,
riding the white clouds,
reaching the realm of the Emperor."*
This is also the case.
As the saying goes: *"Establish virtue, achieve great deeds, and attain the Three Unperishables"* (*Sān Bùxiǔ*),
this too is the **not-perishing**.

Master Li says: The **contented man** finds joy even in poverty,
the **resolute man** never falters in beginning or end,
the **steadfast man** faces no peril,
the **internally enlightened** transcends birth and death—
the man who dies yet does not perish,
his **True One** eternally abides.

Master Wu says: The Laozi’s Dao
uses **obscurity** (*mèi*) as **enlightenment** (*míng*),
and **weakness** (*ruò*) as **power** (*qiáng*),
yet this chapter speaks of **enlightenment** and **power**—why?
Because Laozi is not obscure internally,
though externally he seems so;
not weak internally,
though externally he appears so.
His **obscurity** and **weakness** are remedies for external affairs,
his **enlightenment** and **power** are prescriptions for internal cultivation—
both are practiced without contradiction.

Master Dong says: The **place** is as the **stopping** Principle’s place in the *Yijing*—
only he who understands the Dao and can act upon it
finds his own place and dwells securely,
thus though external things change without end,
his heart never strays—
this is the way of **no entry without self-possession** (*Wùrù ér bùzìdé*),
the means to **longevity**.
Only he who can truly **know himself** and **strengthen himself**
without losing his place
attains true **longevity**—
this is the **unmoved** and **solitary** that does not perish with the changes of life and death,
standing alone and enduring eternally—
how could it be measured by mere quantity?

**Chapter Thirty-Four**
The Great Dao flows unrestrained,
its movement knows no left or right.
Master Lü says: It is the most exalted, most profound—
its boundaries are unfathomable,
its roots are untraceable.
Only the Dao could be so.
It encompasses the universe without distinction,
fills the boundless void,
its motion and stillness are unceasing,
its coming and going endless,
flowing freely without obstruction,
wandering through all things,
moving left and right without restriction—
its application is vast indeed.
Within the body, the Great Dao is the **original qi** (*yuánqì*),
pervading all hundred bones,
in the joints when full,
in the passages when full—
flowing freely without exclusion,
present in every part.

Master Chai says: The Dao is the mystery of all things,
its presence is never absent.
The text often employs the *"fú"* (*兮*) particle paired with *"qí"* (*其*),
as in *"Huāng fú qí wèicháng"* ("Vast and boundless, its limits are without end")
and *"Pèi fú qí wèizhào"* ("Frail and subtle, its signs are not yet revealed").
Again, in Chapter Fifteen, all lines use *"fú"* paired with *"qí"*—
this is the style of Laozi’s text.

「○ Master Lin says: Vast and boundless, its presence can be left or right,
without any attachment or obstruction.

○ Master He says: Great indeed is the Sage’s Dao,
nurturing all things, reaching its apex in Heaven.
When speaking of *"fú"* (泛), it is profound as the sea,
lofty yet ever returning to its beginning.

Left is left, fitting to the left.
Right is right, fitting to the right.
The text says: *"Hold the Great Symbol"* (*zhí dàxiàng*),
and all under Heaven will follow—
for there is nothing it cannot traverse.

All things depend on it for birth yet it does not decline,
its work accomplished yet it claims no ownership.

Master Lü says: The power of generation and transformation
originates from Nature alone—
yet the Dao never applies its artifices,
nor boasts of its abilities.
Though Heaven and Earth are vast beyond measure,
they still rely on it,
and to all who seek, it gives.
Though the Six Extremes are vast,
they do not depart from its embrace,
and though the autumn hair is minute,
it awaits its shaping.
Does it not labor endlessly?
Standing alone, it gives life without resistance,
fulfills without possession,
does not dwell on its deeds—
this is the very essence of the Dao.

○ Master He says: All things lean upon it for gestation,
revealing themselves in every place,
while the Sage abides in ease.

○ Master Lin says: All things are born from the Dao,
how could it refuse them?
Once born, how could it claim them as its own?
Clothing and covering all things yet not ruling them,
ever without desire,
this may be called *"small"*—
all things return to it yet it does not rule them,
this may be called *"great"*.

Master Lü says: The Dao returns in the most hidden depths,
manifests in the most transformative ways.
It nurtures and shelters,
as if without beginning or end.
It covers and fosters,
each following its own nature—
like a babe by day relying on its milk,
by night on its swaddling.
Expanding its virtue of love and nurturing,
it acts yet does not rely,
it grows yet does not govern,
letting all unfold naturally and ever without desire.

Within, it observes its mystery,
and nothing escapes its embrace.
All movement cannot fathom its path of return—
this may be called *"small"*, hence it says,
*"all things return yet it does not rule"*.

Ever without desire,
this may be called *"small"*—
the Dao is nameless and hidden,
and its namelessness is vast beyond measure,
profound beyond reckoning.
Before anything existed,
it was without form—
then all things returned to it,
and there was no distinction.
It harmonized without ruling,
thus its greatness may be named.

○ Master He says: *"Clothing and covering"* means to shelter and reveal.
From the *Zhuangzi*:
The Sage encounters it without resistance,
passes through without clinging,
adapts and responds—this is *virtue*,
matches and aligns—this is the *Dao*—
and the meaning of *"not refusing, not possessing, not ruling"* is clear.

Ever without desire is stillness—
the Sage unifies in *non-action* and *non-desire*,
so its heart is without heart.
Gathered, it does not fill a palm’s grasp,
though simplicity may seem small,
all things return to it.
Not ruling means each thing is entrusted to its own way,
scattered yet filling the Six Extremes—
how vast it is!
Thus it is said:
Heaven and Earth have their constancy,
the sun and moon their brightness,
birds and beasts their groupings,
trees and woods their standing.

The Sage lets virtue flow and follows the Dao,
already attaining perfection.
From this perspective,
the Divine Person has no deeds,
the Sage no name—
why would it dwell on dominion?
Thus it says:
*"Its deeds cover all under Heaven yet seem not its own,
transforming and granting yet the people do not rely on it—
though it has no name to be raised,
it lets things rejoice in their own accord,
standing in the unfathomable,
wandering in the nonexistent."*

Master Li says: *"Clothing and covering all things yet not ruling"* means
forgetting its own origin.
*"All things return yet it does not rule"* means
letting all unfold naturally.

Thus the Sage never claims to be great,
and so it achieves greatness.

Master Lin says: Only by being small can one be great—
the Sage’s refusal to claim greatness
is how its deeds are fulfilled.

This is the meaning of *"retaining the feminine,
the Dao becomes the valley of all under Heaven."*

○ Master He says: The Sage never claims to be great,
yet greatness is achieved through this.
Though at first it may seem unclear and unpossessed,
its greatness cannot be concealed in the end—
is this not the Dao?

○ Master Wu says: This chapter begins with the Dao of Heaven and Earth,
then concludes with the Sage—
for the Sage and Heaven and Earth are one.

When the yearly work is complete and all things return,
this is the Dao’s ultimate greatness—
yet Heaven and Earth do not dwell on their deeds,
and all things know no ruler.
Thus, though the Dao of Heaven and Earth is great,
it does not claim greatness itself,
and the Sage is likewise—
hence it achieves greatness.

Master Lü says: Within the realm, there are four great things,
yet the Emperor resides in one of them.
The Sage holds humility as its instrument,
dwells in self-effacement,
is lowly so that others exalt it,
is humble so that others honor it.
It forgets its towering might,
discards its boastful demeanor—
then it can fulfill the Dao’s complete greatness.

**Chapter Thirty-Five**
*Hold the Great Symbol*, and all under Heaven will follow.
Go forth without harm,
and peace and tranquility endure.

○ Master He says: The Great Dao has no form,
so it lacks even the symbol of form—
yet its symbol is vast.
The Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth,
enters the minutest hairs—
it cannot be named or described,
thus it is called the *Great Symbol*.
To say *"hold"* means to uphold this and go forth—
if one can embody the nameless, formless Dao,
and follow Nature’s constant transformations,
then governing the body and the realm,
spanning past and future—
what path cannot it traverse?

Though I say *"all under Heaven is my path"*,
it is not merely that it does not harm—
it also calms the nature of life and death,
secures the blessings of moderation,
and stands serene without further action,
reaching the pinnacle of its journey—
the moment of perfect harmony between Heaven and humanity.

From the *Zhuangzi*:
*"If one attains its Dao,
there is nothing it cannot do."*

The **Lin** says: *"The Great Symbol*—
this is the symbol of the formless.
To traverse all under Heaven*—
it is to hold the Dao and act accordingly.
When one governs all under Heaven with the Dao,
who can harm it? If all under Heaven is unharmed,
then it is tranquil, serene, and boundless.*

The **Zhenghe** annotation reads:
*"Tranquility means no peril,
serenity means no obstruction,
boundlessness means universal harmony."*

Music and feasts—
passing guests pause.
The Dao when spoken of,
is bland and without flavor;
when seen, it is not visible;
when heard, it is not audible;
when used, it cannot be exhausted.

The **He** says: *"Five tones and six pitches suffice the ears,
eight delicacies and nine tripods suffice the mouth—
these are but the most appealing sounds and tastes to mortals,
only enough to amuse passing guests for a fleeting moment,
not the true source of nourishing the spirit or prolonging life."*

When the feast ends and guests depart,
what concern are they to me?
All things that satisfy desire enough to unsettle the heart
are of this kind.

Yet the Great Dao is not so.
With stillness, one refines the self—
music and color have their limits in delight.
With frugality, one sustains life—
richness and taste have their limits in indulgence.
One wanders the heart toward the bland,
and unites the *qi* with the boundless.
Nurturing the formless, the form abides;
guarding the bodiless, the body remains whole.
Flavor without flavor is sweet,
vision without sight is clear,
hearing without sound is acute,
use without end is vast.

It cannot be exhausted—
for exhaustion means completion.
Not that its use is without end,
but that its Dao is inherently boundless.

The **Li** says:
*"Music and feasts—
sounds and tastes both exquisite—
if one abandons the formless,
how long can they endure?"*

The Dao when spoken of,
has no flavor, no form,
no sound, no color—
because it is bodiless,
its application is boundless.

The **Lin** says:
*"Music*—
the joy of bells and drums—
*feasts*—
the abundance of food and drink—
set music and prepare banquets
to welcome honored guests.
When the music ends and the feast is consumed,
the guests depart and it ceases.
Departure*—
this is leaving.
Though the Dao’s flavor may seem most subtle,
though it is unseen when viewed,
though it is inaudible when heard—
this is to say it does not please the ears and eyes—
yet its use spans past and present without end.
This is the meaning: things have limits,
but the Dao is boundless."*

When one speaks of the Dao emerging from words,
it is as if to say:
*"The Dao in its expression."*

**Chapter Thirty-Six:**
*"When one would contract it,
must first fully expand it.
When one would weaken it,
must first fully strengthen it.
When one would discard it,
must first fully promote it.
When one would take from it,
must first fully give to it.
This is called *subtle clarity*."*

The **Li** says:
*"To hold the Great Symbol,
one can perceive the subtlest workings of things—
once expansion is seen,
one knows contraction is coming.
Before the first sign appears,
one already knows.
This is not the *subtle clarity* of all under Heaven—
who else can attain this?"*

The **Lin** says:
*"These eight lines are all metaphors,
expressing only the principle:
where there is gain, there must be loss.
Contract*—
to gather and to slacken—
what is expanded must slacken;
what is strong must weaken;
what is promoted must decline.
Gain must have its loss.
To give*—
to receive;
to take*—
to lose.
Only those who do not understand
take this as joy,
unaware of the principle—
though it seems obscure,
it is truly clear.
Hence, it is called *subtle clarity*.
Subtle*—
as obscure as the dim—
yet its meaning is most evident."*

The **He** says:
*"Heaven cannot be trusted,
principles have no fixed state—
who can unify them?
The sun at its setting is most luminous,
yet Heaven in its withdrawal of light is swift.
*Qi* has its contraction and expansion,
forces have their strength and decline,
cycles have their rise and fall,
things have their giving and taking—
this is the nature of affairs,
not a matter of desire or aversion.
The Classic says:
*'Gusts of wind do not last the morning,
sudden rains do not last the day—
even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,
how much more so mortals?*
Thus, speaking of *qi*,
when the yang reaches its peak,
the yin arises—
is it not that contraction follows expansion?
Speaking of force,
when things are at their height,
they age—
is it not that decline follows strength?
Speaking of cycles,
when things flourish,
they must wither—
is it not that fall follows rise?
Speaking of things,
what is precious must become base—
is it not that loss follows giving?
When one would act thus,
must first act otherwise—
borrowing human affairs to illustrate Heaven’s principles,
it is but the natural ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness.
Heaven has no partiality—
the Sage has no partiality.
Later generations unaware of this Dao
mistook it for schemes of manipulation,
yet this is but the interplay of circumstances,
where there is a mind for schemes,
the Sage is far removed.
How can this chapter’s grand meaning
be viewed through the lens of contrivance and action?"*

From the *Zhuangzi*:
*"When the eyes are about to fail,
first examine the autumn hairs;
when the ears are about to dull,
first hear the gnat’s flight;
when the body is about to stiffen,
first hasten to bound and leap;
when the heart is about to be confused,
first distinguish right and wrong—
thus, what does not come to pass
is not yet reached.*
The annotator takes this to mean:
*'The extremes of high and low,
the natural cycles—
the Sage abides in the middle,
walking the path of harmony,
fully whole throughout life.'*
This Dao is subtle yet profound,
difficult yet clear."*

The **Liu** says:
*"Expansion must lead to contraction,
strength must lead to weakness,
promotion must lead to decline,
giving must lead to taking—
this is the natural order of things,
called *subtle clarity*—
subtle clarity*—
the most refined and evident.
Some interpret this as a matter of strategy,
yet the Dao of Heaven is beneficent and does not harm—
such is its nature."*

The **Dong** says:
*"The ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness—
a principle of mutual dependence,
though its workings may be subtle and hidden,
its meaning is clear and evident.
Only those who dwell in purity, stillness, and weakness
do not fall into its schemes.
Softness overcomes hardness,
weakness overcomes strength.
Fish cannot be plucked from the depths,
and the state’s sharpest tools
should not be shown to the people."*

The **Li** says:
*"Those who study the Dao,
preserve the formless,
hold to the utmost softness,
compete with nothing—
then naturally know the omens."*

「If one were to employ harshness and violence,
or to rely on stratagems and clever tactics,
and seek to triumph over all things—
this would not be the Dao/Way, indeed.

Just as fish are creatures of water,
if one seeks to differ from other fish
and desires to escape the depths—
is this possible?

Since it is not possible,
then humans too cannot rely on stratagems.
Those who rely on stratagems
go against the natural order—
like fish leaving the depths, they must perish.
The state’s sharpest tools
should not be shown to the people,
as Confucius said:
*"One may share the Dao/Way with them,
but not one’s stratagems."*
The same meaning applies here.

The Sage uses stratagems,
yet does so by reversing the natural order
to align with the Dao/Way—
still, this should not be done lightly.
How much more so for ordinary people—
should they not be warned?

The **He** says:
*"Under Heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way is soft and weak,
encompassing Heaven and Earth,
penetrating all things.
This is how softness and weakness
overcome hardness and strength.
Thus, when humans dwell in the Dao/Way,
the Dao/Way dwells in humans,
just as fish dwell in water,
and water dwells in fish.
The Dao/Way departs from humans, they die;
water dries from fish, they perish.
Fish that hide their scales and conceal their fins,
inhale and exhale the water,
do not die—
humans who retreat to blessed lands,
inhale and exhale the *qi*,
do not perish either.
The state’s sharpest tools
are the Dao/Way’s hidden principles—
if one were to reveal them lightly,
Heaven’s retribution would swiftly arrive.
The *Great Cave of Heaven Constitution Scripture* states:
*"To reveal what is not meant for humans is called ‘leakage’;
Heaven’s treasures are profound indeed—
its hidden principles should not be recklessly disclosed."
The *Southern Huaxia Scripture* says:
*"There are swords of Gou and Yue,
yet they are kept in their cases,
not dared to be used—
this is how they are preserved,
and the meaning is the same."*

The **River Above Master** says:
*"Sharp tools are stratagems of the Dao/Way.
When governing the state with stratagems,
one should not show them to officials.
When practicing the Dao/Way for oneself,
one should not reveal them to those unworthy."*

The **Lin** says:
*"The depths symbolize the Dao/Way,
and fish symbolize humans—
just as fish cannot escape the depths,
so humans cannot exist outside the Dao/Way."*

**Chapter Thirty-Seven** says:
*"The Dao/Way is ever without action,
yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could uphold it,
all things would transform of their own accord."*

The **He** says:
*"In the *Zhuangzi*,
though all things differ,
their principles and Dao/Way are not exclusive—
thus, they are nameless.
Because they are nameless,
there is no action.
Yet without action, nothing remains undone.
The phrase ‘the Dao/Way is ever without action yet nothing remains undone’
is the great constant of the Dao/Way.

The ‘constant’ is without desire,
to observe its subtlety—
the ‘constant’ with desire,
to observe its transformations.
Only the constant without desire
is without action,
while the constant with desire
is without anything left undone—
yet the Dao/Way is one.

This ‘without action yet nothing remains undone’
is the Dao/Way’s true constant.
The Dao/Way is without presence yet without absence—
if lords and kings could uphold this Dao/Way,
it would manifest through all things,
not requiring transformation yet naturally transforming itself."*

The **Lin** says:
*"This chapter aligns with ‘the Dao/Way is ever without name’—
‘without action yet nothing remains undone’
is the natural unfolding of the Dao/Way.
If lords and kings could uphold this Dao/Way of non-action,
then without seeking to transform all things,
all things would transform themselves."*

The **Lü** says:
*"The body’s imitation,
responding without deliberation—
when the spirit is too fixed,
this is non-action.
Lords and kings,
entangled in the Nine Sovereigns’ ways,
if they uphold and do not lose them,
will refine their essence into fluid,
fluid into marrow,
marrow into essence,
essence into the primal pearl,
and the primal pearl into golden elixir—
what else could this be but the transformation of ten thousand things?
If one desires to act upon this transformation,
I shall restrain them with the nameless *purity*.
The nameless *purity* also desires not to act.
Without desire, there is stillness—
and under Heaven, all will naturally align."*

The **He** says:
*"Though transformation acts from above and responds below,
the mechanism of desire to act or to not act
is something the Sage holds most carefully.
The Sage transforms through divine means,
making people adapt to it—
not rushing ahead of its time,
nor lagging behind—
its mechanism is thus.
The Sage does not claim this as his own merit;
I shall follow the transformation of non-action,
returning to the nameless *purity*."*

The saying *"to restrain"* means
to carve and return to the unadorned—
to stand alone, solid and unyielding in form,
though responsive yet still at its core.
This is what is called the nameless *purity*.

The Dao at its origin
cannot be named at all.
The Sage does not even desire it,
let alone the scattered vessels of *purity*,
which bear no extraordinary name.

If the Dao itself requires no intent,
how much more so that which is not the Dao?
Thus, the Sage’s mind is tranquil—
when the mind is unified and steadfast,
all things submit.
How could the world not align?

○ **Master Wu** says:
To speak of acting with intent is like stirring—
to say that one has not yet attained the purity of non-action,
and yet already waits for things to transform,
suddenly harboring intent toward their transformation—
the moment this intent arises,
it is no longer the Dao of non-action.

*"To restrain"* means to press down and settle,
preventing any disturbance.
The nameless *purity* refers to the Dao of non-action.
When the impulse to act arises,
one must restrain this intentional desire
with this nameless *purity*—
that is, to govern oneself through the Dao.
Once this nameless *purity* restrains the desire,
the desire itself will cease to desire.
The stillness that follows is the return to the origin—
when the desire to act is restrained by the Dao,
the desiring ceases,
and the one who acts becomes still.
Thus, though the Sage acts without intent,
the world will align of its own accord.

○ **Master Lü** says:
Within oneself, the moment a thought stirs,
it is called *emotion*—
when emotion moves, all transformations arise.
Once the thought has slipped through,
one must urgently reflect back,
extinguishing the restless mind,
restoring the pure simplicity,
and restraining it with *purity*—
only then may one unify the nature.
Hence it is said:
*"When transformation stirs to act,
I shall restrain it with the nameless purity."*

Moreover, the Dao is originally formless;
*purity* is but a borrowed term.
The Sage fears that even this may become rigid and fixed,
that clinging to *purity* for use
might lead to exhaustion beyond remedy.
Thus, he declares:
To let the world’s myriad forms be,
the mind must be empty;
to respond to the world’s myriad movements,
the mind must be still.
Only by suppressing desire to empty the nature,
and severing learning to empty the mind,
can one refine the self—
without obstruction, nothing is unattained;
can one govern the nature—
without exception, nothing is unachievable.
Thus, the world will naturally settle and align.

○ **Master Li** says:
Heaven and Earth act without doing,
and all things emerge.
The Sage acts without doing,
and all people thrive in peace.

Speaking of cultivation and refinement,
there is no deliberate action—
in moments of tranquility,
preserve the formless.
At the slightest movement,
one must first become aware,
and upon awareness,
restrain it with the nameless *purity*.
*Purity* is formless;
it is also called *nameless*—
meaning *emptiness*.

*(End of Volume Five of the Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing)*
*(Beginning of Volume Six of the Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing)*

The **Way** of supreme virtue is not virtue,
thus it has virtue.
The **Way** of inferior virtue does not abandon virtue,
thus it lacks virtue.
The **Way** of supreme virtue acts without action—
yet nothing fails to be accomplished.
The **Way** of inferior virtue acts with action—
yet nothing is accomplished.

The **Way** of supreme benevolence acts yet nothing is accomplished;
the **Way** of supreme righteousness acts yet nothing is accomplished.
The **Way** of supreme propriety acts yet none respond,
and so they roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.

○ **Master He** says:
The ancients dwelled in **mixed chaos**,
and with the world became **dull and tranquil**.
Though people may have wisdom,
they had no use for it—
this is called **ultimate unity**,
where none know to act yet all abides in **constant naturalness**.

When virtue declined,
at the time of **Tang and Yú**,
they began to establish laws for the world,
dissipating **purity** and scattering **simplicity**,
abandoning the **Dao** for the sake of goodness,
and making virtue perilous through conduct.
Then they discarded **nature** and followed the **heart**.

The **heart** gives rise to **heart-awareness** and **mind-knowing**,
yet it was insufficient to govern the world—
so they adorned it with **culture** and enriched it with **learning**.
When **culture** extinguishes **substance**,
and **learning** drowns the **heart**,
then the people began to be bewildered and disordered,
unable to return to their original **nature** and **emotions**.

This chapter’s essence lies entirely here.
Supreme virtue not being virtue—
that is **mixed chaos** and **dull tranquility**.
Inferior virtue not abandoning virtue yet lacking it—
then the doer is ruined, the grasp is lost.

Supreme virtue acting without action—
that is **ultimate unity** in **naturalness**.
Inferior virtue acting with action—
that is what is called “beginning to act for the world.”

Supreme benevolence acting yet nothing is accomplished—
**ultimate benevolence** has no favorites,
and its distance from virtue is still slight.

Supreme righteousness acting yet nothing is accomplished—
when righteousness governs actions,
then inferior benevolence is already one rank below.

If one views **virtue** and **righteousness** through the lens of **moral power**,
then this is what is meant by
“abandoning the **Dao** for goodness” and
“making virtue perilous through conduct.”

When it says “not virtue,” and “nothing is accomplished,”—
all are without **heart**,
acting without purpose is called **Heaven**.
When it says “not abandoning virtue,” and “nothing is accomplished,”—
all are with **heart**,
acting with purpose is called **human**.

Supreme propriety acting yet none respond—
this is already one rank below inferior righteousness,
adorned with **culture** and **rites**.
In **loyalty** and **trustworthiness**, it is too thin;
enriched with **learning**, it is too ornate.
Its distance from **nature** grows ever farther.

Supreme propriety—
that is **excessive rites**.
When rewards are lavish, the response must be lavish,
yet if the response does not match the reward,
then strife arises from it.
Rolling up the sleeves—
a gesture of forcibly pulling away—
is the mark of one who violates propriety.
“Force” (扔) is “pull,”
but the character is incorrect.

○ **Master Lin** says:
“Acting yet none respond”—
this is compelling the people yet they do not follow.
“Force” (扔) is “pull,”
when the people do not follow yet one forcibly drags them by hand.
It is a strong and violent pulling.
This merely describes the act of compelling the people,
hence it says: *“roll up the sleeves and force it upon them.”*

○ **Master Li** says:
The previous chapter spoke of **constant non-action**,
so next it speaks of *“the **Way** of supreme virtue is not virtue.”*
Supreme virtue is non-action,
thus it aligns with the **Dao**.
Inferior virtue is action and does not align with the **Dao**.
**Benevolence** and **righteousness** are still close to virtue,
and can serve as steps toward the **Dao**.
**Rites** are purely action;
when **rites** are used to harmonize all,
they instead fail to harmonize—
for all action must eventually falter.
If one holds to them without faltering,
they can gradually lead one to a better state.
From **benevolence** to return to **virtue**,
from **virtue** to return to the **Dao**,
directly reaching **non-action**.

○ **Master Qin of Huáihǎi** says:
**Virtue** and **power** are the fullness of **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **rites**, and **wisdom**,
while **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **rites**, and **wisdom** are but aspects of **virtue** and **power**,
with the **Dao** as their foundation,
and **benevolence** and **righteousness** as their application.
Thus, when the **Dao** is lost, **virtue** follows;
when **virtue** is lost, **benevolence** follows;
when **benevolence** is lost, **righteousness** follows;
when **righteousness** is lost, **rites** follow.

**Rites** are the thinnest of **loyalty** and **trustworthiness**,
and the origin of disorder.
**Preconceived knowing** is the ornate aspect of the **Dao**,
and the beginning of **folly**.
**Master He** says:
Disorder begins with folly—
this is the utmost of how **rites** and **wisdom** lead to ruin.
The *Zhuāngzi* clearly enumerates these five stages from *“when the **Dao** is lost, **virtue** follows”*,
and says: *“Now they make these things into objects of pursuit,
and to return to the root is not so easy.
How simple it is! How simple it is—
only the **Great Person** can do it.”*

Though it says *“so”*,
it also says: *“Hidden yet cannot fail to act—this is **rites**.
Distant yet cannot fail to dwell upon—this is **righteousness**.
Near yet cannot fail to broaden—this is **benevolence**.
Moderate yet cannot fail to accumulate—this is **rites**.
Central yet cannot fail to elevate—this is **virtue**.
One yet cannot fail to simplify—this is the **Dao**.*
Though these have a sequence of high and low, first and last,
when the Sage employs them all,
what is not the **Dao**?

Once there was a **Master of Mysterious Transformation** who said:
The **Dao** is the subtle essence of all things,
and when spoken of, it is called **virtue**—
the totality of the **Two Poles** (yin and yang).
To attain it at the highest is the **Dao**,
to attain it in the middle is **benevolence** and **righteousness**,
to attain it in the lower is **rites** and **wisdom**.
To attain it in the cold and lose it—
that is not **human**.
This statement is the most concise and clear.

○ **Master Lǚ** says:
The **Dao** is the **substance** of **virtue**,
and **virtue** is the **application** of the **Dao**.
**Benevolence** and **righteousness** arise from the **heart**,
and are worthy of praise.
But when it comes to **rites**,
they grow ever more distant from **nature**,
ornate yet lacking in substance.
To engage in elaborate **rites** and trivial details
without seeking their foundation—
**loyalty** and **trustworthiness** grow ever thinner,
though outwardly they may gleam.
To follow them brings order,
to oppose them brings chaos—
not even a hair’s breadth can intervene.
Is this not the origin of disorder?

Thus it is said:
When the **Three Sovereigns** had the **Dao**,
they did not know that the **Dao** transformed into the **virtue** of the **Five Emperors**.
When the **Five Emperors** had **virtue**,
they did not know that **virtue** transformed into the **benevolence** and **righteousness** of the **Three Kings**.
When the **Three Kings** had **benevolence** and **righteousness**,
they did not know that **benevolence** and **righteousness** transformed into the **wars** of **Qín-Hàn**.
This is what is meant.

Moreover, the common people take **wisdom** as a chisel,
pursuing superficial ornamentation.
Though they think themselves perceptive,
they do not realize that **ultimate folly** begins from here.
Hence it says:
*“Preconceived knowing* is the ornate aspect of the **Dao**,
and the beginning of **folly**.”*

Mr. Wu says: **"Loyalty and sincerity"** are the depth of **virtue**, gradually thinning as they transform—once diminished, they become **benevolence**; twice diminished, they become **righteousness**; thrice diminished, they become **rites**. Thus, the profound **virtue** of loyalty and sincerity grows shallow. **Rites** seek to bring order without chaos, yet they instead become the foundation of disorder—hence, they are called *"the origin of chaos."*

*"Preconceived knowing"* is akin to foresight—it refers to **wisdom**. The **Dao** is like the fruit of a tree: before its birth, its essence lies within, its embryo yet unseen. Once born, **virtue** is its root, **benevolence** its trunk, **righteousness** its branches, **rites** its leaves, and **wisdom** its blossom. All arise from the **Dao**. **Wisdom** seeks to be enlightened yet avoids folly, but instead it gives rise to folly—hence, it is called *"the beginning of folly."*

Mr. Li says: *"Preconceived knowing"* is **discernment**; **discernment** is the first deviation from the **Dao**, hence it is called *"the ornament of the **Dao**,"* and those who follow the **Dao** do not dwell there. Thus, the noble man abides in what is profound, not in what is shallow; he rests in substance, not in ornament. Hence, one discards the former and takes the latter.

Mr. He says: To abide in profundity and not in shallowness means to honor **virtue** over **rites**; to rest in substance and not in ornament means to embody the **Dao** without relying on **wisdom**. The former is called shallow and ornamental; the latter, profound and true. Again, he says: This passage divides the six terms—**Dao**, **virtue**, **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **rites**, and **wisdom**—with **Dao** being nameless and **virtue** named. From **virtue** arise **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **rites**, and **wisdom**, each descent growing more refined, hence this chapter ranks **Dao** as first, **virtue** as second, **benevolence** as third, **righteousness** as fourth, **rites** as fifth, and **wisdom** as sixth.

Mr. Lü says: The sage, witnessing the **Dao** in existence, values purity and profundity, discarding superficiality. He anchors himself in sincerity, rejecting ornamentation. By abandoning the superficial trappings of **rites** and embracing the vast body of the **Dao**, the world is governed. It is like cultivating one’s life: returning to simplicity, earnest as uncarved wood—abiding in profundity. Walking where there is no path, moving without trace—avoiding shallowness. Emerging without gate, entering the boundless—resting in substance. Focusing the spirit, suppressing perception—discarding ornament. To abandon superficiality and take profundity—what could be more attainable?

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**
In ancient times, those who attained **Oneness**—
the heavens attained **Oneness** and became clear,
the earth attained **Oneness** and became tranquil,
the spirit attained **Oneness** and became numinous,
the **valleys** attained **Oneness** and became full,
all things attained **Oneness** and were born,
and the sovereigns attained **Oneness** to uphold the **Dao** for all under heaven.
This is how **Oneness** is achieved.

Mr. He says: In *Zhuangzi*, it is said that *"the Primordial had neither being nor non-being, and the nameless gave rise to **Oneness**."* Before **Oneness** took form, those who attained it in antiquity placed it at the chapter’s beginning, declaring that **Oneness** as the **Dao** has existed since ancient times. **Oneness** is what the **Dao** generates; it is not called "attaining the **Dao**" but "attaining **Oneness**," revealing the **Dao’s** supremacy—its singularity, unpaired, unmatched by anything. *Liezi* speaks of the "uncarved," doubting the solitary; this speaks of **Oneness**’s essence. Hence, it is said: *"Doubt the solitary, for the **Dao** cannot be exhausted."*

Mr. Lin says: **Oneness** is the **Dao**. The heavens, through it, are clear and manifest their forms; the earth, through it, is stable and bears all things; the spirit, through it, is empty yet numinous; the **valleys**, through it, are empty yet full. All things, through it, are born. The sovereigns, through it, uphold rectitude for all under heaven. Their attainment of it is what brings clarity, tranquility, numinosity, fullness, birth, and rectitude.

Mr. Lü says: Those who attained **Oneness** in antiquity—after the Primordial **Dao** had divided—were able to make the heavens clear, the earth tranquil, the spirit numinous, the **valleys** full, all things born, and the sovereigns rectify the world. There is no other reason: they attained the marvelous workings of **One Qi**. **One Qi** is unmatched; harmonized with the world, it is the child of the Great **Dao**, the mother of numinous clarity, the precursor of the Undifferentiated, and the ancestor of all transformations. Constant above and below, unchanging from ancient to modern, hence the sage draws near by examining himself.

The heavens are the rounded symbol of the head; attaining it makes the beard turn black, the eyes bright, the ears sharp—all senses become keen and clear. The earth is the true yellow field; attaining it makes one bear all things, nurture all growth, and remain stable and unmoving. The spirit attains it by chewing the six breaths, condensing the embryonic essence, and then transforming into numinous clarity. The **valleys** attain it, filling the brain and marrow, making the celestial **valleys** empty yet full, generating the true purple essence. All things—the six viscera, five organs, nine orifices, and hundred bones—attaining it make the seven fluids flow freely, the five entrails firm, the **Qi** harmonized and nourishing, thus enabling longevity and enduring vision. The sovereigns are the primordial spirit and heart-mind; attaining it elevates one instantly to sainthood, rectifying the form. There is no other reason: all is the work of **One Qi**.

Mr. Wu says: **Oneness** is the **virtue** of the void. In the previous chapter, it is called *"embracing **Oneness**,"* *"being **Oneness**."* In later chapters, it is said that *"the **Dao** generates **Oneness**."* All refer to this. *Zhuangzi* calls it *"Great Unity"* (*Taiyi*), yet also simply *"**Oneness**."* This is the natural work of the **Dao**; its operation is empty yet not full, yielding yet not grasping, soft yet not rigid—all as stated in the previous chapter, now fully revealed.

The one attained is called attaining this **Oneness** as **virtue**; the *yi* [以] is said because of this, one attains such effects. The clarity of Heaven, the tranquility of Earth, the responsiveness of Spirit, the fullness of the grains, the ceaseless generation of all things—how the sovereigns stand above the world—all are due to attaining this **Oneness**.

Heaven, without this **Oneness** to clarify, would fear splitting. Earth, without this **Oneness** to tranquilize, would fear erupting. Spirit, without this **Oneness** to enliven, would fear fading. The grains, without this **Oneness** to fill, would fear exhaustion. All things, without this **Oneness** to generate, would fear extinction. The sovereigns, without this **Oneness** to uphold their rectitude and nobility, would fear collapse.

Mr. He says: Clarity belongs to Heaven. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to clarify it, then day would be as dark as night, and clarity would split asunder. Tranquility belongs to Earth. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to tranquilize it, then mountains would crumble and rivers dry up, and tranquility would erupt in chaos. Responsiveness belongs to Spirit. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to enliven it, then Spirit would lose its responsiveness and fade away. Fullness belongs to the grains. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to fill them, then the grains would not be full and would wither away. Generation belongs to all things. If one does not know this **Dao**, this **Oneness**, to generate them, then their generation would fail and they would decay.

As for the sovereigns, with one body ruling above the subjects, attaining **Oneness** and embodying **Oneness**—only then can they uphold rectitude for the world. If not for this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, then those in high positions would be in peril, those with virtue of two or three would face disaster, and the calamity of decline would surely come—how could one not be warned?

Rectitude is uprightness.

Mr. Lü says: Heaven is the accumulated **virtue** of Yang, symbolizing the sovereign. If it lacks clarity, then Yin and Yang would be disordered, the cosmic order would collapse, **Oneness** would not flow, and signs of splitting would appear. Earth is the accumulated **virtue** of Yin, symbolizing the ministers. If it lacks tranquility, then rigidity and softness would falter, mountains and rivers would crumble, **Oneness** would not be preserved, and signs of eruption would manifest. Spirit is the unfathomable interplay of Yin and Yang. If it lacks responsiveness, then calamities and omens would arise, and **Oneness** would not reside, bringing the time of decline.

The grains are empty yet contain all things. If they lack fullness, then the flow of nourishment would fail, and the fear of collapse would arise. **Oneness** would not be full, and the peril of exhaustion would begin. All things have form. If they lack generation, they would wither and dry up. **Oneness** would disperse, and the time of extinction would come.

The sovereign unites the Three Realms and possesses all things. If he lacks rectitude and nobility, then officials would not fulfill their duties, the four seas would not submit, and the calamity of decline would follow.

Moreover, within a man’s body, the most Yang aspect shines above—from the Heavenly Pillar, the first vertebra, to the Jade Capital above the Heavenly Axis—all is Heaven. If it lacks clarity, then the marrow would diminish, teeth would fall out, vision would dim, and the form would decay and split. If his Earth lacks tranquility, then the true soil would dry up, the yellow sprouts would not grow, and the vital essences would erupt and dissipate. If his Spirit lacks responsiveness, then the embryo would wither, the prenatal sage would scatter, the seven fluids would not flow, and they would eventually exhaust and perish. If his myriad things do not generate, then the joints would lack vitality, the organs would weaken, and he would end in stillness and extinction. If the sovereign relies on his high nobility, then the Cinnabar Field would not be upright, the true nature would stray, the heart-shadow would become askew, and he would fear collapse.

Mr. Lin says: *Klie* [裂] means to split apart. *Fa* [发] means to move restlessly. *Xie* [歇] means to fade and lose responsiveness. *Jie* [竭] means exhaustion. The empty can receive; the non-empty stops and cannot receive.

*Ju* [蹶] means to topple. To be in a high and noble position without this **Oneness** is to court collapse.

Thus, nobility depends on humility as its foundation, and height depends on lowliness as its base. Therefore, the sovereigns call themselves "lonely," "widowed," and "without grains." Is this not taking humility as the foundation?

Mr. Lin says: The phrases "nobility depends on humility" and "height depends on lowliness" are merely metaphors. Without lowliness, how could there be nobility? Without the base, how could there be height? Lowliness and humility are the foundation of nobility and height.

The sovereign’s self-designation—"lonely," "widowed," "without grains"—are all words of self-debasement, also used as metaphors for emptiness and selflessness. Is this not so? Saying, "Is this not so?"—how could it be otherwise? These two words are a marvel of literary style.

Mr. Wu says: This chapter speaks of six things in parallel, and below it elaborates on the "noble" and "high" from above, specifically addressing the sovereigns. The sovereign’s position is noble and high, yet the **virtue** of **Oneness** does not seek fullness—only by placing oneself in lowliness can one attain it. "Lonely" is like an orphan without a father, "widowed" is like a woman without a husband, and "without grains" means "not virtuous"—these are all unflattering names no one would wish to bear, yet the sovereigns use them to describe themselves, thus placing themselves in lowliness.

Earlier, it was said, "Lowliness is the base, humility is the foundation," and later only "humility is the foundation"—this is a concise way of encompassing both.

Mr. Li says: Is this not so? How could it be otherwise?

Mr. He says: Nobility originates from humility, height is founded on lowliness. Therefore, the sovereigns call themselves "lonely," "widowed," "without assistance," "without virtue," and "without grains"—thus returning to their roots without losing the **Dao**.

*The Classic of Changes* says: "Constantly uphold **Oneness** in **virtue**, use humility to regulate rites. The steadfastness of constant **virtue**, the power of humble **virtue**." This is the Daoist **Dao** of the "feminine **Oneness**"—guarding simplicity while applying broadly.

Thus, "attaining ten chariots without desiring chariots" [致数车无车], originally "attaining ten praises without desiring praise" [致数誉无誉]—the character *yù* [誉] was mistaken.

Mr. Lin says: "Attaining ten chariots without desiring chariots" [致数车无车]—the original text reads "attaining ten praises without desiring praise" [致数誉无誉], where *yù* [誉] was incorrectly written.

This passage is a metaphor, and if *yù* [誉] is used, the following lines—"like jade, like stone"—lose their connection in meaning.

Mr. Lin says: "The term *shù chē* [数车] refers to the components of a chariot—none of which alone is called a chariot. Similarly, the *shù* [数] of my single body—none of which alone is called *wǒ* [我, 'I']. When the hub and spokes unite, it is called a chariot; when the Four Great Elements unite, it is called *wǒ*. To not desire to be like jade or like stone is to forget both nobility and humility, embracing only Oneness."

Mr. He says: "To focus on *shù chē* while splitting over the distinction of names and numbers, or to fixate on jade and stone while favoring the extremes of nobility and lowliness, is to stray from the Dao of Oneness and origin. As *Zhuangzi* states: *All things are equal in Oneness—what is short, what is long?* Observing things through the Dao, what is noble, what is base? This is the way. Thus, the chapter’s concluding metaphor serves as a warning.

Mr. Chái says: "The wheels, spokes, and other parts are the humble components of a chariot, yet without them, no chariot exists. Counting all these parts, none alone is called a chariot—hence, *shù chē wú chē*. Jade emerging from stone—one does not exalt jade over stone, for the longer it endures, the more it forgets its origin."

**Chapter Forty: The Returning is the Dao’s movement; the yielding is the Dao’s use.**

Mr. Lin says: "Returning is returning to origin, to stillness. Stillness is the source from which movement arises—just as *The Classic of Changes* says: *Gèn* [艮] completes both beginning and end. Only by yielding can one grow strong; clinging to strength alone leads to fracture. Movement relies on stillness as its function; strength relies on yielding as its use."

Mr. Wú says: "The Dao’s utmost stillness returns to the Dao, hence movement arises. The Dao’s original emptiness returns to the Dao, hence existence emerges. Thus, the root of emptiness and indistinctness, the origin from which all things spring—bound by the mechanisms of emergence and return, confined to the realms of movement and stillness—these are the body and function of the Dao.

To grasp the true nature of things, one must uphold their origin. To govern the transformations of things, one must uphold their fundamental principle. Thus, when movement generates life, if one does not align with its transformation, one knows that emergence must return to return. If one does not align with its passage, one knows that movement must return to stillness. Observing things as they emerge, one sees they must ultimately return. Observing things as they move, one sees they must ultimately still. Thus, the heart of Heaven and Earth becomes visible.

In spring and summer, all things flourish in abundance, their roots and shoots bursting forth, their flowers and fruits unfolding outward—emerging and living. Is this not returning to movement? In autumn and winter, all things shed their flowers and bear fruit, withdrawing inward, returning to their innate nature, orderly yet unforced. Is this not yielding in use?

Consider the body: to cultivate longevity, one must recognize the origin of life. To seek immortality, one must understand the mechanisms of emergence and return—this is called returning, this is called movement and stillness. Returning is the restoration of the true essence; movement is the activation of Heaven’s inherent potential.

From the first emergence of *yīn-yáng* [一阳], within the stillness of definition, the pivot turns, the currents flow—grasp the meaning of seven returns, govern and supplement the Three Fields, circulate the Hundred Vessels. Without movement, one cannot restore life—thus, *The Returning is the Dao’s movement*.

The Dao is formless and soundless. Only the yielding can subdue the rigid; only the weak can subdue the strong. Thus, one must steadfastly guard the feminine and stillness, like an infant before it speaks. Moreover, nothing in the world is as yielding and weak as water—water is surpassed only by *qi*, and *qi* is surpassed only by the Dao. The yielding and weak of Dao-*qi*-spirit-water penetrates metal and stone, melts the sharp, grinds the hard—nothing it cannot enter. Thus, *The yielding is the Dao’s use*.

Mr. Lin says: "Returning is the Dao’s movement—the spirit emerges and is immediately drawn back. Yielding is the Dao’s use—concentrating *qi* to achieve softness."

All things under Heaven are born of *yǒu* [有], and *yǒu* is born of *wú* [无].

Mr. Lin says: "Only after Heaven and Earth exist do all things emerge—thus, things are born of *yǒu*. Yet who gave birth to Heaven and Earth? At their origin, they emerged from the Great Emptiness—thus, they are born of *wú*. Through movement, stillness, strength, and yielding, we speak of the beginning of *yǒu* and *wú*."

Mr. Lǚ says: "All things under Heaven—*yǒu* and *wú* generate each other, alternately emerging and returning, without end. Without *yǒu*, one cannot reveal *wú*; without *wú*, one cannot generate *yǒu*. All things are born within Heaven and Earth—thus, they arise from *yǒu*. Heaven and Earth take form within the Great Emptiness—thus, *yǒu* arises from *wú*. When *yǒu* is born, it returns to non-being; when form is born, it returns to formlessness. The mutual generation of *yǒu* and *wú* is like a cycle, and the meaning of returning is profound indeed.

The Sage deeply comprehends this principle. Observing water, one does not watch its flow but its return-flow. Observing wood, one does not watch its blossoms but their withering—thus, though things differ in myriad ways, the Dao is evident upon sight.

Yet Heaven and Earth are the parents of all things, and humans are the most refined of all things. What is *yǒu* in us is form; what is *wú* in us is spirit. The embryo forms our shape—*yǒu* born of *wú*. The Hundred Spirits arise from the body—*wú* born of *yǒu*.

Thus, true *yǒu* is not *yǒu*; true *wú* is not *wú*. Those who grasp this meaning naturally harmonize with true *yǒu* and true *wú*."

Mr. He says: "All things under Heaven are born of *yǒu*, and *yǒu* is born of *wú*—this is seeking the origin. Only after Heaven and Earth exist do all things emerge. Heaven and Earth are the first origin of all things. Before Heaven and Earth, there was the undifferentiated chaos—this too is the first origin of Heaven and Earth.

*Wú* generates *yǒu*; formlessness generates form. When *yǒu* is born, it returns to non-being; when form is born, it returns to formlessness. Beginning from *wú*, it disperses into *yǒu*; ending in *yǒu*, it returns to *wú*. Thus, the Dao’s simplicity does not ultimately disperse into things. Those who drift and forget returning are destined to lose strength and stray far from the Dao."

Mr. Li says: "All things under Heaven are born of *yǒu*, and thus *yǒu* is named the Mother of all things. *Yǒu* is born of *wú*, and thus *wú* is named the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

Chapter Forty-One: The superior man, hearing the Dao, strives and practices it. The mediocre man, hearing the Dao, is uncertain whether it exists or not. The inferior man, hearing the Dao, laughs at it—if he does not laugh, it is not the Dao.

Mr. Lin says: "To strive and practice it means that upon hearing, one must believe. To be uncertain whether it exists or not means to both believe and doubt, to regard it as both *yǒu* and *wú*. The most vulgar and coarse of men will simply laugh at it. Only when the lowest of men laugh at it does one truly see the Dao’s exalted nature.

Han Yu’s critique of literature states: 'If people laugh at it, one should take it as joy—how much more so for the Dao.'

Mr. He says: "The Dao is natural; those who practice it can attain it, those who hear it can speak of it. Those who practice it diligently are the superior among men. The common man seeks the Dao without sincerity or depth, wavering between existence and non-existence, clinging to thoughts and intentions—one in ten thousand may achieve it. As for the vulgar and shallow of the world, though they may appear modest and weak, they laugh at the void as absurd, yet their laughter is insufficient to expose the Dao’s greatness, for those who truly know the Dao are rare.

Mr. Lü says: "The superior man is endowed with pure and thick virtue, penetrating profound principles. Hearing the Dao, he instantly comprehends and believes without doubt, firmly resolving to practice it, fearing only that he cannot attain it. Thus it is said: *strive and practice it*.

The mediocre man is of moderate nature, capable of both high and low. Initially delighted, he later grows weary; at first diligent, he later becomes lazy. Hearing the Dao, he hesitates and doubts, unable to decide between acceptance and rejection. Though he wishes to advance, he lacks the resolve to act; though he wishes to retreat, he still hesitates. Thus it is said: *uncertain whether it exists or not*.

The inferior man is of impure and muddled nature, failing to grasp ultimate truth. Hearing the Dao, he deems it absurd and ridiculous, not only disbelieving but laughing and condemning it. Yet if the inferior do not laugh at it, how can it be called the pure and unadulterated Dao?

Therefore, it is said: *To establish speech, the Dao appears obscure; to advance the Dao, it seems to retreat; the great Dao appears common; virtue’s height resembles a valley; supreme brightness seems like shame; vast virtue appears insufficient; established virtue seems like theft; true substance seems corrupted; the greatest square has no corners; great vessels take long to form; great sound is rare in tone; great form is shapeless.*

Mr. Lin says: *To establish speech* means to found doctrine. The scholars of antiquity, in their teachings—from *The Dao appears obscure* onward—have spoken these words. These are merely rhetorical devices, not original to me but found in the ancients.

*The Dao appears obscure* means that only through obscurity does clarity arise. The previous chapter states: *Self-evident is not true clarity*, and again: *Not self-evident, hence clarity*. This is the same.

*To advance the Dao, it seems to retreat*—retreat is true advancement. *Ji* (夷) means level; the great Dao is level, without distinction. *Rú* (类) means same; it harmonizes with the dust, blending light with the mundane.

*Virtue’s height resembles a valley*—to be empty and not self-aggrandizing. *Supreme brightness seems like shame*—not dazzlingly distinct. *Vast virtue appears insufficient*—if one is self-sufficient, it becomes narrow. *Theft*—to desire to act but dare not. To establish virtue is to have purpose; to establish it through what one dares not do is how virtue is truly built. *True substance seems corrupted*—pure and unchanging substance, yet appearing as if it were ever-shifting. This too conveys the meaning of sufficiency without self-sufficiency.

*The greatest square*—this is the boundless void. Though the void has east, west, south, and north, who can perceive its corners? *Great vessels take long to form*—like casting a tripod; how could it be hastened? *Great sound is rare in tone*—among the sounds between Heaven and Earth, none surpass the wind and thunder, yet they are not always present. *Rare* means seldom seen. *Great form*—Heaven and Earth. The *Yijing* says: *No symbol is greater than Heaven and Earth*—who can fully perceive their form?

Mr. He says: *To establish speech*—the ancients who founded doctrine, as mentioned below, were all ridiculed by the world, yet the great Dao endured. *The Dao appears obscure*—great enlightenment is like no enlightenment. *To advance the Dao, it seems to retreat*—great courage is like no courage. *The great Dao appears common*—equality is like no equality. *Virtue’s height resembles a valley*—substance is like emptiness. *Supreme brightness seems like shame*—purity is like impurity. *Vast virtue appears insufficient*—having abundance yet not daring to exhaust it. *Established virtue seems like theft*—established in Heaven and Earth yet acting like one who seeks fleeting ease. *True substance seems corrupted*—substance like gold and stone, yet appearing to decay over time. *The greatest square has no corners*—no doors, no rooms. *Great vessels take long to form*—uncarved, unpolished. *Great sound is rare in tone*—not in tune with pitch pipes. *Great form is shapeless*—separate from color, separate from name.

The Dao is hidden and nameless. Only the Dao can be freely given and fully realized. Mr. Lin says: *The Dao is hidden and nameless*—it cannot be named. *To give* means to bestow upon others. Those with the Dao can give to others without possessing it themselves. *Realized*—the great fulfillment of the Dao, fulfilling self and others, and only then is it called great fulfillment.

「○ Master He says: *The Nameless*—cannot be pointed out and named, hence there are things like those described above that cannot be fully captured by words. Yet though the Dao is nameless, it exists and is truly good at lending and bringing to fruition. *Lending*—bestowing and applying through resonance, universally present in all beings, pervasively encompassing all things, like Heaven’s bestowal and Earth’s nurturing. The small fulfills the small, the great fulfills the great—what is there that is not the Dao?

The *Zhuangzi* says: The Dao transforms and lends to all things, yet the people do not rely upon it. It holds nothing aloft to claim fame, letting things rejoice on their own. Standing in the unfathomable, it wanders in the boundless—this is the Dao.

**Chapter 42:** *The Dao gives rise to One, One to Two, Two to Three, Three to all things.* All things bear yin within them and embrace yang, blending the *qi* to achieve harmony.

○ Master He says: *The void gives rise to Nature, Nature to the Dao, the Dao to One, One to Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth to all things.* All things arise from One and are fulfilled, receiving the subtle and wondrous *qi* and transformations. Whether it is beings or things, turning away from cold toward warmth, from darkness toward light, from evil toward good—all are expressions of *bearing yin and embracing yang*. *Embracing yang* is the same as *embracing One*, the Dao’s breath of life and its transformations. Man shares with Heaven and Earth as the threefold realm, yet among all things, he is the most responsive. Hence, man is Heaven’s trust of *shen* (spirit), Earth’s bestowal of *jing* (essence), and the *chong* (intermediary) and *he* (harmonious) *qi*’s nurturing. Man is precious in guarding his *qi*, preserving his essence, and cherishing his spirit—thus standing with Heaven and Earth, his means of sustaining the *chong* and *he*, to be modest rather than full. The *Classic of Documents* says: *Fullness invites loss, modesty invites gain*—this is the Dao of Heaven.

○ Master Lin says: *One*—the Supreme Ultimate. *Two*—Heaven and Earth. *Three*—the Three Realms. All things arise from the void. The Dao is the origin of all things, the principle of Nature. Once the Three Ultimate realms are established, then all things are born. The birth of all things depends on bearing and embracing yin and yang *qi*, moving through the void’s harmony. This is how harmony comes to be.*

○ Master Lü says: *The Dao gives rise to One Qi, One Qi to Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth to all things.* The reason the Dao gives rise to One is that the Supreme Ultimate was yet undifferentiated, a pure and undivided One Qi. *One gives rise to Two*—meaning that clarity and turbidity were divided, and thus Heaven and Earth took their places. As the *Yijing* says: *The Great Ultimate generates the Two Principles*—this is correct. *Majestic and resplendent it emerges from Heaven; solemn and austere it issues from Earth.* The two intermingle to form harmony, hence the order of humanity is achieved. *One yin, one yang*—this is the Dao. Saying *bearing and embracing*—they cannot be separated for even an instant. What can be separated is not the Dao. Those who cultivate and nourish understand that the moon is the mother of all yin, and the sun is the father of all yang. Therefore, those who bear and embrace should delight in absorbing Heaven’s light and chew upon the harmonious *qi*, letting the Heavenly Essence fill and overflow, the two luminaries intertwine, and all spirits rest in peace. Entering and exiting the primal transformations, they soar in pairs to the *Yuqing* (Jade Purity).

○ Master Dong says: *For all living things, their backs face stillness*—belonging to yin’s quiet nature. *Their mouths, noses, ears, and eyes reside at the front*—belonging to yang’s dynamic nature. Hence it is said: *bearing yin while embracing yang*. Like plants, they turn their backs to cold and face warmth. The *chong* (intermediary) *qi* moves between them, and when spoken of generally, the spirit is yang while the substance is yin. The spirit moves within—this is *embracing*, while the substance appears without—this is *bearing*. The *qi* is yang in motion and yin in stillness, then balanced by the harmonious center, blending within form and substance, the mechanism upon which the spirit rides.

What man hates most are *孤寡不谷* (loneliness, widowhood, and barrenness), yet kings and nobles take these as their titles. Hence, some things are diminished to gain, while others are gained to diminish. Master He says: *Kings and nobles who claim loneliness, widowhood, and barrenness*—do so by adopting the guise of being unsupported and unassisted. This is their name for self-humility and preservation.

The three titles are what man most detests, yet they are also what man uses to teach. Those in high station fall, the arrogant perish—this is the natural course. Yet within loss there is gain, and within gain there is loss. This is the changing nature of things. Hence, the Sage acts as the master of the Three Realms, holding the *chong* (intermediary) and containing the harmony, willingly enduring what man hates, willingly receiving what things diminish. How does he know that those who humble themselves are not exalted, those who retreat are not surpassed? Evil is not always evil, loss is not always loss. The *Classic* says: *The Dao is void yet its use is inexhaustible; fullness is its opposite.* The *Yijing* says: *What is great cannot be filled*—hence it is received with modesty, for modesty is the opposite of fullness.

○ Master Lin says: *What man hates most*—nothing compares to *孤寡不谷* (loneliness, widowhood, and barrenness), yet kings and nobles take these as their titles. This is also an analogy for the Sage’s self-humility and self-abasement. Its meaning is that Heaven, Earth, and man all arise from the void. All things take yin and yang as their foundation, yet their means of birth are all the harmonious *qi* of the void. Those who study the Dao should embody this meaning, thus valuing the ability to be empty and without. In the world, some things seem to diminish yet actually bring gain, while others seem to bring gain yet actually bring loss. The principles of loss and gain are not fixed—like the moon, when full it wanes, this is gain turned to loss. When it wanes, it must wax again, this is loss turned to gain. What man teaches, I also teach.*

The overbearing and forceful shall not meet a proper end—I shall take this as my teaching father.

Master He says: In *The Golden Back Inscription* it is written: *"The overbearing and forceful shall not meet a proper end."* It further states that those who delight in victory shall inevitably encounter their match, thus showing that the ancients all took this as a teaching, and I too do not seek to differ—I take this as my teaching as well. Moreover, the one who serves as the teaching father is because it is simple and easy to grasp.

The teaching father is the mother of the Dao—nothing else. Heaven, Earth, and all things arise from the One Dao, taking the void as their essence.

○ Master Li says: Whatever teachings man offers are nothing but the pursuit of goodness—I too teach in this way.

○ Master Wu says: This speaks of the principle of using softness. *Liang* (梁) also means "strong." To block water with wood, to bear beams with wood—both are called *liang*, taking from their strength. "Not meeting a proper end" means not meeting a good death, as in Zilu’s case, who walked resolutely until Confucius said he would not meet a proper end, and indeed he later died in the disaster of Kong Yue.

The "teaching father" is like the root of teaching—father refers to that which is supreme and unexcelled above all else.

Man’s teachings instruct in the use of softness—I too teach this. Those who are overbearing and forceful, unable to embrace softness, shall inevitably fail to preserve themselves. The benefit of overcoming others with forcefulness brings the loss of not meeting a proper end—this is what is meant by "gain turned to loss," and it is the foremost principle for teaching others. Hence, it is called the teaching father.

○ Master Ni says: Laozi often likens the Dao to a mother, yet here it is called father. The mother governs nurturing, while the father governs teaching. For one who takes the role of teacher, it is fitting to be revered and stern as a father.

**Chapter 43**
The softest thing under Heaven
Ranges freely over the hardest thing under Heaven.

「There is nothing that enters the *Wujian* [無間, "utterly seamless" or "void of gaps"], and thus I know that *Wuwei* [無為, "non-action"] brings benefit. Master Lin says: The firm may be easily broken, while the soft endures forever. To act with the utmost softness between the firmest things is like water’s ability to penetrate stone. *Wujian* refers to the absence of seams or fissures. *Wuwei* [無有, "void of form"] is the same as *Wuwei* [無形, "formlessness"]. As in the human body, the *Rongwei* [榮衛, "nourishing and defensive *qi*"] circulate between the seams, and the *qi* and meridians flow through them. Even in the gaps where there is no fissure, sunlight and moonlight enter—these are all cases of *wuwei* [無有, "void of form"] entering *wujian* [無間, "seamlessness"].

○ Master He says: Under Heaven, nothing is softer than *qi* [氣], and *qi* is nothing softer than the Dao/Way. The Dao/Way’s softness is its ability to envelop Heaven and Earth, to penetrate all things. Laozi once spoke thus to Guan Yin, explaining that the Dao/Way and *qi* are soft in this manner. The *qi* of Heaven and Earth, though as firm as metal and stone, penetrates everywhere. The Dao/Way is the same: its origin is subtle yet simple, its culmination vast yet firm and enduring. Thus, the utmost softness is not weakness, and the utmost firmness is not strength—like the cascading waters of Mount Tai eroding stone, or the hemp rope severing the *danji* [單極, "single pillar"]. This is of the same kind.

To "drive and range" [驰骋] is the *Zhuangzi*’s meaning of "riding Heaven and Earth, ranging over all things." One who can wield the Dao/Way to govern existence moves from the utmost firmness to the original softness, from the original softness to the primordial *Yuan* [元, "origin"]. As in the *Liezi*: "The body of *Liezi* is in harmony with the heart, the heart with *qi*, *qi* with spirit, and spirit with the void." By this, one sees that the Dao/Way is utterly seamless in its operation, and its subtlety is profound. Then one knows the benefit of *wuwei* [無為, "non-action"], where non-action is the return to the Dao/Way, stillness is the dissipation of *qi*, and the root of life is preserved by entering the *wujian* [無間, "void of gaps"]. One may attain this through silent contemplation.

○ Master Lü says: Under Heaven, nothing surpasses water, yet even water is not entirely without form. Some things seem formless but enter into form—this is *qi*. *Qi* is inherently soft, and even though *qi* is soft, when nourished to its utmost firmness and strength, no one can resist it. To govern firmness with firmness, if it does not break, it will shatter. To govern firmness with softness, neither the softness is worn away nor the firmness is harmed. The Dao/Way’s ultimate softness is the same as *qi*. To range over the utmost firmness means that *qi* can penetrate joints and open passages—thus, the softest thing under Heaven ranges over the hardest thing under Heaven. When formless enters form, the formless is never exhausted, and the formed never sated. Only the *qi* of the Great *Fan* [梵, "pervading, transcendent"] is without form or substance, and thus it can envelop Heaven and Earth without boundary, and cling to the finest hairs without interiority. The sage embodies this, and his virtue/power is thus realized.

When one sees the Dao/Way clearly, nothing is impassable—this is how one governs all under Heaven through divine transformation, likening the ultimate person to the *Qi Mu* [氣母, "matrix of *qi*"], refining and drawing forth the *Taihe* [太和, "Grand Harmony"]. Divine clarity resides within him, unrestricted in its coming and going, profound beyond measure. Thus, it is said: "There is nothing that enters the *wujian* [無間, 'void of gaps']." The sage of *wuwei* [無為, "non-action"] dwells before the *Xiangdi* [象帝, "Archetypal Sage"] and in the midst of the *Taiji* [太极, "Grand Polarity"]. The Dao/Way’s wondrous application truly lies here. The sage follows it, standing without instruction, sitting without debate, moving with emptiness and returning with substance—nothing is impossible. How could this be a minor supplement?

The ultimate person practices *wuwei* [無為, "non-action"] and does nothing, yet his body is not weary. He forgets self and others, yet his essence is not diminished. He does not desire the Dao/Way, yet the Dao/Way naturally returns to him. Thus, it is said: "I know that *wuwei* [無為, 'non-action'] brings benefit."

The teaching of *wuwei* [無為, "non-action"]—that is, the benefit of non-action—is rare under Heaven. Master Lin says: The first two sentences are all analogies. By this, one knows that *wuwei* [無為, "non-action"] is not the same as *wuwei* [無不為, "doing nothing"]. Non-action as teaching, and spontaneous action without effort—these are all the wondrous applications of the Dao/Way, and the people of the world cannot comprehend them. Thus, it is said: "The world rarely attains this."

Benefit [有益] means having practical efficacy. ○ Master He says: What is meant by "non-action as teaching"? Like Heaven and Earth possessing great beauty yet not speaking, the four seasons having clear laws yet not debating, and all things having established principles yet not explaining—when sincerity is felt, what need is there for words? What is meant by "the benefit of non-action"? Like using a boat to travel on water, or a sled to traverse mountains, or making fields from high ground and ponds from low ground—the transformations of simplicity, what need is there for action? This is all due to focusing *qi* to achieve utmost softness, and reaching the essence of non-action. The Dao/Way thus operates and transforms.

Thus, the world rarely attains this. Teaching without words, gaining without seeking—one who preserves sincerity and embraces the Dao/Way will have the world follow naturally. Who else could possibly aspire to this?

**Chapter 44**
Which is closer to me: name or body?
Which is more abundant: body or wealth?
Which is more harmful: gain or loss?
Master Lin says: Name and wealth are external things, of no benefit to my body. Thus, even if one gains or loses them, what harm could they truly cause? Yet those who do not know the Dao/Way often trouble themselves over these matters.

○ Master He says: *Zhuangzi*’s Bo Yi died for his name beneath the slopes of Shouyang, while the robber Zhi died for profit atop the mounds of Dongling. Though their deaths differed, both perished in vain, harming their true nature. The zealous martyr for name, the greedy one for profit—both sacrifice their bodies, and though they die without regret, they never realize that their bodies are heavier than all under Heaven, let alone that dying for name or profit could be a burden. One who knows the Dao/Way regards even the body as not truly his own—how much more so for beautiful names and beautiful profits, which are external things!

The unknowing try to compare name with their life’s fate, saying that name is like a flower, while the body inherently has name. If the name is high and the body is endangered, then is the name not distant from the body? They compare wealth with their life’s fate, saying that wealth is like a resource for the body. Yet even if wealth is abundant and the body is harmed, is not wealth then lesser than the body?

Thus, it is said:
*"Sheng wo ming zhe sha wo shen"* [生我名者殺我身, "Those who give me life through name kill my body"],
*"Yi wo huo zhe sun wo shen"* [益我货者损我神, "Those who enrich me with wealth harm my spirit"].

At the beginning, when there is neither gain nor loss, it is like water before waves. But when loss comes after what has already been lost, harm arises naturally—who could compare this to the peace of original non-existence?

Who could escape harm after what has already been lost?

○ **Master Lü** says: To prioritize the body over name and value the body above wealth is still not to forget oneself. But he who forgets himself does not even possess the body—how much less does he possess name and wealth!

Indeed, name without substance is hollow, and substance without name is true. The noble man toils night and day, pondering good and ill, yet even his form grows thin. The wealthy man exhausts his body with labor, competing for fame and hoarding wealth, yet cannot enjoy it all—his form becomes but an alien vessel.

Yet the sage values the body as the foundation for all under Heaven, not through forgetting himself, but by making all under Heaven know that name is insufficient for intimacy and wealth is insufficient for abundance. Thus, **Bò Yì** starved to death beneath Chief Yang’s slope, a sacrifice to name. **Zhóu Jī** died upon the Eastern Ridge, a sacrifice to profit.

Between name and wealth, which is more abundant, which is less? To sacrifice the body for name, the world will call him a **gentleman**; to sacrifice the body for profit, the world will call him a **villain**. Gain brings joy, loss brings sorrow; covetousness of gain forgets loss, and greed for profit forgets righteousness. This is like using **Duke Sui’s pearl** to shoot a thousand-foot-high sparrow—though one may strike the bird, the pearl is already lost. Truly, what is lost is heavy, what is gained is light—how lamentable!

The disease lies in desiring what one cannot obtain; when one has already gained but fears losing it, the disease is even worse than the loss itself. Only when one attains **equanimity between having and lacking**, and accepts both gain and loss with balance, does true peace begin.

Therefore, **excessive love leads to great expenditure**, and **hoarding wealth brings heavy loss**. ○ **Master Lín** says: Love clings to something, so one must inevitably exhaust mind and strength in seeking it—love grows greater, so does the exhaustion. This speaks of name. Greed leads to hoarding, and when loss comes one day, it will be great. If one hoards nothing, one loses nothing; if one hoards little, one loses little. Only through much hoarding does one invite much loss—these two lines illuminate the next three.

○ **Master Hé** says: To crave fine names is called **excessive love**; name is but a guest to substance, so the greater the name, the greater the mental strain. To dwell on rare wealth is called **hoarding**; profit is the catalyst for chaos, so the thicker the wealth, the greater the loss of what is truly valuable.

○ **Master Wú** says: Love refers to love of name; great refers to the body. Comparing name to the body, the body is greater than name. Those who admire name love it excessively, yet love of the body is not as fervent as love of name—this will inevitably drain the mind and shorten life. Thus, it is said: **great expenditure**. Hoarding refers to hoarding wealth; great also refers to the body. Comparing wealth to the body, the body is more substantial than wealth. Those who crave wealth hoard it excessively, yet those who value the body do not weigh it as heavily as those who value wealth—this will inevitably lead to the loss of life and premature death. Thus, it is said: **heavy loss**.

To know sufficiency is to avoid disgrace; to know restraint is to avoid peril—thus one may endure long.

○ **Master Lín** says: Only he who knows sufficiency does not fall into self-disgrace; only he who knows restraint does not court danger—thus he may endure long. These three lines are timeless wisdom, never exhausted by ages past or future.

○ **Master Hé** says: To know sufficiency means recognizing the proper measure in what one has already gained in name and profit, so that the body may early withdraw from strife—what disgrace could there be? To know restraint means refusing even a hair’s breadth of what one ought not to possess in name and profit, so that the body may remain hidden—what peril could there be? Only then may one endure long.

○ **Master Lü** says: A contented heart seeks nothing beyond itself, so there is no disgrace. A still mind extinguishes all entanglements, so there is no peril—thus one may endure long, may endure forever.

○ **Master Wú** says: To know the fixed measure within oneself, then one is sufficient without greed, and does not fall into disgrace through reckless actions or loss of integrity. To know that external things bring no true benefit, then one restrains without seeking, and does not court peril through depletion of life or premature death—thus one may endure long.

○ **Master Lǐ** says: Name and wealth, gain and loss—all are matters of **artifice**. They never endure long. Only to know sufficiency and restraint may one endure long.

**Chapter Forty-Five**
Great fulfillment seems like a lack, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great abundance seems like emptiness, yet its use is endless.
Great rectitude seems like bending, great skill seems like clumsiness, great eloquence seems like stammering.

○ **Master Lín** says: Fulfillment brings lack; great fulfillment is always as if lacking, so its use is inexhaustible. Abundance brings emptiness; great abundance is always as if empty, so its use is endless. The previous chapter states: "Hollow brings abundance, worn-out brings renewal"—this is the same meaning. Great rectitude is always as if bent; what seems crooked is straight, what seems curved is whole. Great skill is always as if clumsy; it does not boast of itself. Great eloquence is always as if stammering; it does not force speech.

○ **Master Lǐ** says: The previous chapter speaks of knowing sufficiency to avoid disgrace, so it follows with *great fulfillment seems like a lack*—virtue in excess appears as deficiency, life in excess appears as poverty. Great fulfillment as lack, great abundance as emptiness, even to the point of seeming bent, clumsy, or stammering—all are virtue in excess appearing as deficiency. Its use is without end.

○ **Master Wú** says: To fulfill as fulfillment, to be abundant as abundance, to be straight as straight, to be skillful as skill, to be eloquent as eloquence—this is small. But to lack and not be fulfillment, to be empty and not be abundance, to bend and not be straight, to be clumsy and not be skillful, to stammer and not be eloquence—this is the greatness of fulfillment, abundance, straightness, skill, and eloquence.

Agitation conquers cold, stillness conquers heat—**clearing and tranquility** are the true norm for all under Heaven.

○ **Master Lín** says: Agitation’s peak is cold, stillness’s peak is heat—agitation and stillness are but the two forces of **yin and yang**. When **qi** stagnates in one extreme, it becomes illness; only **Dao’s** clearing and tranquility, neither having nor lacking, neither moving nor still, is the true norm for all under Heaven.

○ **Master Hé** says: The Dao’s norm is **clearing and tranquility**, and it is only through **clearing and tranquility** that greatness is attained. Agitation conquers cold, yet when **yang** reaches its extreme, **yin** arises; stillness conquers heat, yet when **yin** reaches its extreme, **yang** arises. All extremes arise from one-sided dominance. But when Heaven is clear and Earth is tranquil, this is the supreme norm for all under Heaven—neither dominance nor extremity—yet it is vast and enduring. The Classic says: *"If one can always maintain **clearing and tranquility**, all under Heaven will naturally return to this."*

*"When the Dao prevails in the world, even swift horses are turned aside to spread manure.
When the Dao does not prevail, warhorses are bred in the suburbs."*

**Master Lǚ** says: In times of prosperity, the common people flourish, the seas are at peace, weapons are laid aside, and the people diligently till the land, competing in agriculture and sericulture. Their manure enriches the fields—though fine horses exist, they serve no martial purpose. How could this not be called the Dao?

In times of decline, all affairs falter, calamities arise, and the strong oppress the weak. Boundaries are contested, and the seeds of war take root. Warhorses gallop across battlefields, blocking the flow of **yin and yang** and stunting the growth of all things. How could this not be called the absence of the Dao?

For the body is but a microcosm of the world. The *Nánhuá Jīng* (Zhuangzi) speaks of wild horses and dust—thus, horses symbolize **qi**.

**Yang Zi** says: **Qi** is like a horse that carries one toward good or evil. Indeed, **qi** is the Dao, and the Dao is **qi**. From the One **qi**, all things arise; where **qi** lingers, things grow soft and weak, and where it departs, things harden and die.

*"However"*—the word *"however"* (却) means to reverse, *"walk"* (走) means to circulate. Circulating refined **qi** upward against the flow nourishes the brain’s blood and fertilizes the roots, thus nourishing the body. Hence: *"When the Dao prevails in the world, even swift horses are turned aside to spread manure."*

When the Dao does not prevail, one abandons roots for external pursuits, the mind agitates, and breath races upward—through the upper orifices, it disperses in great waves; from below, the **jing** (essence) leaks away in a steady drip. Daily, the heart battles, and the six evils (of excess) arise at the borders.

○ **Master Hé** says: When a ruler of the Dao governs the world, he does not use military might to dominate others but instead prioritizes agriculture and grain. Thus, even swift horses are turned aside to fertilize the fields, never neglecting the inner for the outer.

The Classic says: *"Remove the filth from one’s ancestral home, and all will be restored."* To spread manure is to mend what has decayed.

In a world without the Dao, warhorses are bred in the suburbs—
*Stallions prance in the boundless wilds.*

The suburbs originally refer to lands where horses are raised; if such lands obstruct farming, it is a warning.

○ According to **Master Wú Chéng’s** annotated edition, the original text reads: *"When the Dao prevails in the world, even swift horses are turned aside to spread manure [with carts]."* In an age of the Dao, there is no mutual invasion, so fine horses are not harnessed to war chariots but instead pulled lowly manure carts to fertilize the fields. Other commentaries omit the character *"cart"* (车), but **Huì’ān’s** *Júzǐ Yúlù* (Zhu Xi’s Dialogues) includes it. **Zhang Heng’s** *Dōngjīng Fù* (Eastern Capital Eulogy) states: *"Swift horses are turned aside to pull manure carts,"* using Laozi’s full line. **Master Wú’s** edition is well-reasoned—scholars must not overlook it.

No greater crime exists than desiring what one should not,
No greater fault than grasping what one desires,
No greater calamity than failing to know sufficiency—
Thus, the sufficiency of *"knowing sufficiency"* is eternal sufficiency.

**Master Lín** says: Wars all begin from the seed of desire. Once desire takes root, when will it ever be enough? Only by attending to what is essential does one avoid crime, calamity, and fault.

Only those who regard insufficiency as sufficiency remain truly sufficient. This further illuminates the previous chapter’s meaning: *"Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace."*

○ **Master Wú** says: *"Crime"* refers to transgressions, *"fault"* to misfortune, and *"calamity"* to disaster—yet calamity is graver than fault. To covet the Rampart Pass and still long for Shù is the failure to know sufficiency.

○ **Master Lǐ** says: *"Crime," "fault,"* and *"calamity"* all stem from desire. Hence the conclusion: *"Knowing sufficiency, one is always sufficient."* For the contented poor find joy in poverty.

**Chapter 47.**
*"Without stepping outside, one knows all under Heaven."*

**Chapter 48.**

*"Without peering through the window, one perceives the Dao of Heaven.*
*The farther one goes, the less one knows.*
**Master Hé** says: Laozi spoke to Wenzi: *"Qi and spirit arise from within; spirit and qi move with Heaven. This speaks solely of how spirit alone can foreknow."*

○ **Master Lǐ** says: *"Without stepping outside, one knows all under Heaven"*—this means those who follow the Way know the inner and not the outer. Knowing the inner while ignoring the outer means knowing nothing; seeing the inner while ignoring the outer means seeing nothing. But if one only knows the outer and sees the outer while forgetting the inner, then one’s knowledge and perception are shallow and narrow.

○ **Master Wú** says: The principles of all things and affairs under Heaven are already complete within oneself. Thus, even without stepping outside, one knows them all. The Dao of Heaven is the root of all principles; it is grasped through inner observation, not like external, tangible things that must be glimpsed through a window. Those who do not realize that all is already within themselves must travel far to know even a single matter. Hence, the farther one goes, the less one knows—how could one ever know all under Heaven without stepping outside?

○ **Master Lín** says: Though Heaven and Earth are vast, human nature and the principles of things are fundamentally one. Even without stepping outside, one may know them. Though yin and yang transform, their patterns endure through the ages—visible even without peering through a window. If one insists on seeking them externally, how much can one truly know from where one’s feet tread? How much can one truly see with one’s own strength? The more one labors, the more one’s mind grows dim. Thus it is said: *"The farther one goes, the less one knows."*

Therefore, the Sage acts without moving yet knows, sees without looking yet understands, does without doing yet achieves. **Master Hé** says: One does not guess at others through conjecture but knows them through the Way. One does not probe Heaven through speculation but perceives it through the Way. Others are myself; myself is Heaven. If one must wait to step outside and peer through a window, then one abandons the mind for the external. When spirit is insufficient, how can knowledge and perception suffice? What relation does this have to the Way? The *Yijing* says: *"No thought, no action. Still and unmoving, yet responsive—thus one attains the patterns of all under Heaven."* Who but the most divine of all under Heaven could comprehend this? It further says: *"Only the divine moves swiftly without haste, arrives without traveling."* This is the Way of not acting yet reaching, not seeing yet knowing, not doing yet achieving.

○ **Master Lín** says: The Sage arrives without moving, understands without seeking, achieves without doing—such is the Way’s function. The *Yijing* says: *"Swift without haste, arriving without traveling"*—this is its meaning.

○ **Master Wú** says: It is not that one does not travel to places, but that one arrives at them all as if present. Thus one thoroughly knows all under Heaven’s affairs. It is not that one does not observe things before understanding their principles, but that one perceives the Dao of Heaven without peering through a window. *"To do without doing"*—this verifies the previous two sentences. Only because one does not act yet knows all matters, does not observe yet penetrates the root, does one achieve without effort.

**Chapter 48.**
*"The more one studies, the more one gains.
The more one follows the Dao, the more one diminishes.
Diminish again and again,
until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing remains undone."*

**Master Hé** says: A thousand days of studying wisdom cannot compare to a single day of studying the Dao. It is not that one studies the Dao to learn, nor that the Dao teaches itself. Learning expands knowledge and perception; only through accumulation does it take form. The Dao, however, transcends knowledge and perception—it is originally complete. Learning seeks the Dao; extensive study leads to simplicity. Through diligent practice of non-action, one awakens to the true Dao. First, one gains before diminishing; then, one enters emptiness. Having diminished again and again, even emptiness is emptiness—only then does one align with the true Dao. This is the wondrous realm of non-action.

Laozi spoke to Wenzi: *"Non-action does not mean resisting what must respond or remaining unmoved when stirred. It is not rigid stagnation but flowing with principle while acting, seizing the moment to establish merit, entrusting to others while achieving results—this is non-action yet nothing remains undone."*

○ **Master Lǐ** says: *"Without stepping outside, one knows all under Heaven"*—this is inner knowledge. *"The farther one goes"*—this is external affairs. Hence, it follows as a lesson in study. *"The more one studies, the more one gains"*—this refers to scholars seeking increase. *"The more one follows the Dao, the more one diminishes"*—this refers to those who follow the Way diminishing in all things. The *Yijing* says: *"Mountain over water: Diminishing. The superior person restrains anger and blocks desire"*—this is precisely it. Until there is no anger to restrain and no desire to block, until one reaches non-action, then all under Heaven will be transformed, and the world will turn toward it.

○ **Master Lǚ** says: The perfected one diminishes again and again, until distinctions vanish, still and unmoving, reaching non-action. They preserve the true nature of their essence and embody the origin of the Way. They harmonize with Heaven and Earth in virtue and share in creation’s function. Then they refine the Great Primordial *qi*, extract the golden essence from the elbow’s end, seal the womb and breathe inward, reverse the winds and blend them, irrigate the primal spring—all this is non-action yet nothing remains undone.

○ **Master Ní** says: *"The more one studies, the more one gains"*—this values breadth. *"The more one follows the Dao, the more one diminishes"*—this values simplicity. First, one broadens before narrowing; first, one gains before diminishing. Without gain, where would one find simplicity? To gain without diminishing turns breadth into confusion. Thus, study is the ladder to the Dao, and the Dao is the destination of study. Confucius said: *"Much learning and knowing—this is the gain of study. To thread it all with one principle—this is the diminishing of the Dao."* Having diminished, one diminishes again—this is the utmost diminishing. When diminishing reaches its end, there is nothing left to do. Though there is nothing to do, in truth, nothing remains undone. This is why non-action is precious. If one stops at mere non-action, unable to do nothing yet achieve everything, then one falls into emptiness—this is not the Dao.

*"To take all under Heaven, one must do nothing.
But when action arises, it is insufficient to take all under Heaven."*

He Shi said: *"To act without attachment, to let the mind dwell in non-doing—even if the world is vast, what room could my mind have for it? The sages of old who took all under Heaven did so through the natural Way. The yellow-roofed halls of Yao were not of his making; Shun and Yu held dominion without claiming it—all acted in accordance with their non-doing. If one acts upon the world, then one has attachment. The Classic says: 'To act is to ruin it; the world is a divine vessel that cannot be acted upon.' To act without acting, and the world is governed—this is it. This is why ancient sages did not exchange the Way for all under Heaven, yet always spoke warnings against taking the world, deeply cautioning those who did not know that they would prize the world above the Way. How could they know that non-action and non-doing are the natural Way?"*

Lin Shi said: *"To take all under Heaven, one must act without attachment. Those with attachment lose it. The Three Dynasties’ possession of the world—what room did they have for attachment? Though they spoke of wartime customs as metaphor, their words suffice as warning. Non-doing and doing are but non-attachment and attachment."*

Wu Shi said: *"Non-doing is to have nothing to attend to—this is non-action. Those who speak of taking the world mean only non-action. When virtue is abundant, the world naturally returns to it. If one must exert will and force, engaging in deliberate action, how could one ever take the world?"*

Li Shi said: *"If one rashly acts, the people grow disordered and difficult to govern. Hence, it is said one cannot take the world with such action."*

**Chapter 49**
The sage has no fixed heart, taking the hearts of the people as his own.

Lü Shi said: *"Heaven originally has no attachment to things; through things, Heaven’s heart is revealed. Thus, it is empty yet able to receive, still yet able to respond—like a mirror reflecting forms, whether fair or foul; like a valley echoing sounds, whether loud or soft. Initially, there is no other heart—what fixed heart could there be?"*

Gong Qing said: *"There is but one Way in the world, one heart in the sage. Hence, he likens it to himself. Silent and tranquil, he responds yet remains settled, neither leading nor following, blending his light with dust, harmonizing with all things—yet never differing from them. Thus it is said: the sage has no fixed heart, taking the hearts of the people as his own."*

Li Shi said: *"The previous chapter spoke of taking the world through non-doing, hence follows with the sage’s lack of fixed heart. By 'no fixed heart,' it means adapting to circumstances without opposing the nature of people and things. Thus, the people follow the sage’s words, actions, and transformations, and the world unites in one heart."*

He Shi said: *"The sage’s heart is too vast—what fixedness could it have? His fixed heart is but the heart of the world."*

Zhenghe Annotation: *"The sage’s heart is empty yet able to receive, still yet able to respond—like a mirror reflecting forms, whether fair or foul; like a valley echoing sounds, whether loud or soft. What fixedness could there be? To the virtuous, I am virtuous; to the unvirtuous, I am also virtuous—virtue is virtue. To the trustworthy, I trust them; to the untrustworthy, I also trust them—virtue is trust."*

Lü Shi said: *"Good and evil contradict each other; truth and deceit mock each other. Good and evil, truth and deceit—these are the common distinctions of the world. Thus, those who love virtue, the sage does not defy their nature but aids them with supreme virtue, ensuring they fulfill their goodness. If there are those who are unvirtuous, he also treats them with virtue. Their virtue or lack thereof lies with them, yet my way of treating them with virtue never wavers. All conduct is without exception virtuous, and the world cannot but submit to its transformation—how profound the virtue is! Those who sincerely love trust, the sage does not quench their resolve but aids them with great trust, ensuring they fulfill their sincerity. If there are those with insincerity, he also treats them with trust, yet my way of trusting them never changes. All emotions are without exception trustworthy, and the people firmly and surely trust—virtue reaches its peak. The perfect person transcends praise and blame, forgetting truth and falsehood. The beautiful he treats as virtuous; the ugly, he also treats as virtuous—constantly saving things without abandoning any. The trustworthy he trusts; the untrustworthy, he also trusts—constantly saving people without abandoning any."*

He Shi said: *"Generally, to the virtuous I am virtuous; to the unvirtuous, I do not necessarily treat them as virtuous. To the trustworthy I trust them; to the untrustworthy, I do not necessarily trust them—this is the common heart, not yet the affair of virtue as virtue, trust as trust. The sage’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth: Heaven and Earth cover all without partiality, the sun and moon shine their light without fail. The sage’s heart is unified, merging self and other. Thus, he treats the unvirtuous as virtuous, the untrustworthy as trustworthy. Though good and evil contradict, truth and deceit mock, I treat them all with the natural Way. The Classic says: 'Refine the well-ordered, also refine the unordered; advance the good, to lead the ungood—what is good, what is ungood?' The saying goes: 'Do not counterfeit, do not presume upon the untrustworthy—what is trust, what is deceit?' 'Sincerity shines clearly; observe below and transform.' This is it. From *Zhuangzi*: 'His love is one, his non-love is one; his oneness is one, his non-oneness is one. His oneness aligns with Heaven; his non-oneness aligns with humanity—this is it.'"*

Lin Shi said: *"Virtue or lack thereof lies with them, yet I always treat them with virtue, initially holding no discriminating heart. The Master said: 'If one’s resolve is set on transformation, there is no evil.' This aligns with it. Trust or lack thereof lies with them, yet I always treat them with trust, holding no doubting heart. The Master said: 'Do not presume upon the untrustworthy'—this is the same meaning. When it says, 'I also treat them as virtuous, I also trust them,' it does not mean making the unvirtuous virtuous or the untrustworthy trustworthy. It is merely responding with a heart of non-attachment."*

The Sage’s presence in the world is marked by humility—he muddles his heart for all under Heaven, while the people all fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the Sage treats them all as infants.

 Lü Shi said: *"The Sage embodies the Dao and harmonizes with transformation, without fixed intentions, without certainty, without rigidity, without self. He encompasses all things, muddling his heart to align with their dust, following their nature to align with their transformations. He does not initially presume to take anything upon himself; when all under Heaven share one heart, they are indistinctly unified, without distinctions of good or evil, trust or falsity, truly one without duality. He responds to them with the Dao, hence it is said: 'The Sage’s presence in the world is marked by humility—he muddles his heart for all under Heaven.'

 Lin Shi said: *"'Humility' means not being self-satisfied; the Sage has no pride or self-sufficiency, so he always bears this sense of unease. 'Muddling his heart' means a heart that is undifferentiated yet without sharp edges—this muddled heart is why there are no divisions of virtue or lack thereof, trust or lack thereof. 'Fixing their ears and eyes' means people all direct their sight and hearing toward the Sage, yet the Sage treats them all as infants, hence it is said: 'He treats them all as infants.' This is the Sage’s intention of never abandoning anyone."*

Chapter Fifty.

**Birth and Death, Entry and Exit**

Lü Shi said: *"The Dao gives rise to one qi; qi transforms and takes form, form transforms and gives rise to life. Life is the gathering of qi—all things emerge from the Machine. Life transforms and brings death; death is the dispersal of qi—all things return to the Machine. What has form returns to the formless; what lives returns to the lifeless. Things have birth and death, but their nature knows neither gain nor loss. Birth is the beginning of creation, death the transformation of yin and yang. This is the realm where all things meet their end yet do not depart from the Machine.

Those who depart from the Machine—
their exit is not joyful,
their return is not regretful.
To be born and die,
to die and be reborn—
without preference, without aversion.
The cultivator refines himself,
taking the pure yang, without substance, as the qi of life,
and the turbid yin, congealed and dreg-filled, as the qi of death.

Man draws upon the harmonious qi of the void—
neither turbid nor pure—
yet in life he ascends to the pure yang and descends into the turbid yin.
If yang is pure, he becomes an Upper Immortal;
if he descends into the turbid dregs and ascends to the pure yang,
if yin is pure, he becomes a Lower Ghost.

If one ingests the Six Qi,
nourishes the Original Essence,
absorbs the mist and dew—
these are all transformations of Heaven’s breath,
formless and without substance,
thus able to transcend the spirit and align one’s lifespan with the two solar terms.
This is called dying and being reborn.

But the people of the world consume grains and relish the five flavors—
substantial and dense,
they steal their True Qi,
scatter their pure yang,
and sink into the turbid dregs.
This is called being born and dying."*

Wu Shi said: *"To exit is to be born; to return is to die.
Exit means emerging from the non-existent into the existent;
return means dissolving from the existent back into the non-existent.
The *Zhuangzi* says: 'All things emerge from the Machine, return to the Machine.'
Again: 'Their exit is not joyful, their return is not regretful.'
And: 'There is an exit, there is a return.'
All take exit as birth, return as death."*

Lin Shi said: *"'Birth and death, entry and exit'—these four characters are the chapter’s guiding thread.
To exit is to be born, to return is to die;
to exit is to transcend and depart,
to return is to be lost in delusion.
Only those who follow the Dao can return and exit.

The followers of life—thirteen in number.
The followers of death—thirteen in number.
Man’s life is also thirteen steps into the realm of death.
Why so?
Because of the excess of life’s vitality.

Lü Shi said: *"Yin and yang never depart from the Great Dao,
creation and transformation never depart from the Five Phases.
The harmony of presence and absence forms Heaven and Earth.
They emerge from the Machine to be born,
return to the Machine to die.
Few follow the Dao; many defy it.
Thus, those who cultivate life
do not gaze recklessly,
do not listen recklessly,
do not speak recklessly,
do not walk recklessly—
in stillness and motion, serene and self-nourishing—
these are the followers of life.

Those who court death
let their eyes wander over garish colors,
their ears indulge in wanton sounds,
their mouths crave what is un-Dao,
their feet tread forbidden paths—
in stillness and motion, they drown themselves,
destroying their own vitality—
these are the followers of death.

Moreover, the Way of life and death,
though divided into two,
still knows action without knowing rest,
knows speech without knowing silence,
knows thought without knowing forgetfulness,
knows advance without knowing retreat—
and thus exhausts itself in the realm of death.

The Way of life and death,
when spoken of as thirteen,
three for each of the four—
the Way of neither life nor death
lies in the emptiness of Oneness.
This is why it is not spoken of;
one must awaken to it themselves.

As for the saying of thirteen,
though many have expounded it before and after,
no definitive conclusion exists.
Yet a few interpretations are somewhat acceptable.

An ancient Immortal said:
*'Within yang, thirteen symbols manifest;
within yin, six or seven seek no synthesis.'*
This refers to the numerical completion of water and fire.

Heaven One gives rise to Water,
Earth Six completes it;
Earth Two gives rise to Fire,
Heaven Seven completes it.
Six and Seven—
these are the heart and kidneys,
the water and fire of Kan and Li,
the roots of humanity.
Spirit dwells within them;
the heart houses the spirit,
the kidneys house the essence.
In all daily interactions of the mundane and the sage,
spirit is never absent.

The *Huangting Jing* says:
*'One’s spirit in the body must not be lost.
Spirit residing in the body—this is the follower of life.
Spirit departing from the body—this is the follower of death.'
Water and fire can both sustain life and destroy it—
are they not the followers of life and death?

When the red serpent stirs,
the spirit’s brilliance follows swiftly,
responding faster than grains,
erupting from the Machine—
is this not the realm of death?

Thus it is said:
The followers of life—thirteen in number.
The followers of death—thirteen in number.
Man’s life is also thirteen steps into the realm of death.

*Liezi*, pointing to a skull, said:
*'This one overindulged in pleasure;
this one overindulged in nourishment.'
Warm clothing, heated rooms,
delicious wine and rich grains,
ingesting minerals and stones—
though they nourish excessively,
they harm life instead.
Better to quiet the heart,
disdain flavors,
nourish the spirit-grain—
though it seems to slight life,
it can prolong it."*

Li Shi said: *"Water’s completion is six,
fire’s completion is seven.
The gentle and weak—followers of life;
the strong and great—followers of death.
The gentle and weak can restrain anger and suppress desire;
the strong and great are enslaved by anger and desire.
To restrain anger is to subdue fire;
to suppress desire is to elevate water.
When water and fire are harmonized, life follows—
thus it is said: the followers of life.
To indulge in anger is to lose clarity;
to indulge in desire is to stir the waves of suffering.
When water and fire conflict, death follows—
thus it is said: the followers of death.

Man’s life depends on water and fire;
to step into the realm of death is to let them conflict.
In the Dao of the Elixir,
when water and fire are harmonized,
the Holy Embryo congeals."*

Lin Shi said: *"If cultivation follows the Way,
one may achieve longevity and clear vision.
If cultivation does not follow the Way,
one perishes with all things."*

「The term *徒* refers to one’s kind or category. *动之死地* is not the *动* of motion and stillness, but rather the *动* of action and cessation. *之* means "to go," and *死地* means "the place of death." *夫何故* is an interrogative phrase asking, "Why is this so?"

*生者* is what sustains my life;
*生生者* is what nourishes my life’s vitality.
If one nourishes life excessively—
this is why, upon taking action, one hastens toward the place of death.
This embodies the meaning:
the external body may persist while the self is gone,
having nothingness before one can attain fullness,
emptiness before one can achieve completeness.

○ **Master He said:** "The followers of death and life each number thirteen. Various schools have differing views, but they merely stretch the numbers to fit their own interpretations. In truth, the upper limit of longevity is a hundred years, while the middle and lower limits vary, and contentment with wealth, ease, and peace are all blessings—these are the followers of life. Short-lived, untimely demise, illness, poverty, and frailty are extremes—these are the followers of death. Yet even before discussing virtue and vice, the first two categories each receive their fate from Heaven. Who can equalize them? This is not yet the crux of the matter. But if one is foolish and unworthy, clinging to life while losing reason, creating unnatural agitation to hasten one’s own demise, they not only become a follower of death but also rush toward the place of death—this calamity lies within humanity itself.

*The place of death* refers to those who act in accordance with vice yet do not embrace virtue. In generalizing about the world as described earlier, three out of every ten individuals fall into these categories, not necessarily adhering to the previous figures. Yet the followers of death already number thirteen, and those who hasten toward the place of death number another thirteen—six out of ten are doomed to death. The followers of life number only three—how dire!

If one seeks to preserve life and avoid death,
only one in ten is a virtuous person.

*The Zhuangzi* states:
*"A man’s life is the gathering of his qi;
when gathered, it is life; when scattered, it is death.
If death and life are merely categories,
what need have I to fear them?"*
Thus, it is clear that the true affliction lies in the *place of death*, not in being a follower of death.

○ **Master Wu said:** *之* is akin to "to go" or "to hasten." *生生* seeks to sustain life itself, while *厚* means excessive fixation—whether through Daoist elixir practices that stray from proper alignment or through alchemical preparations that overdo the measures. Their intent is to hasten life, yet in doing so, they only hasten toward the place of death, for their obsession with life does not conform to the natural Dao.

Indeed, those who excel in preserving life
walk on land without encountering rhinoceros or tigers,
enter battlefields without being struck by weapons or armor.
The rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,
the tiger no place to set its claws,
and weapons no place to find their mark.
Why is this so?
It is because they have no place of death—
their hearts are empty, and thus harm cannot touch them.

○ **Master Lin said:** "It is said that the ancient masters of life-nourishment, though wandering in deep mountains, never encountered rhinoceros or tigers; though entering the midst of armies, they were never struck by weapons or armor. This is because they had no fixation—thus, things could not harm them. The rhinoceros could not charge, the tiger could not attack, and weapons could not wound—all because they had no fixation. *The Zhuangzi* also speaks of entering water without drowning, entering fire without burning—this is the same principle.

Why is this so?
Again, a question arises:
things cannot harm them because they embody emptiness and nothingness,
and thus have no place of death.

○ **Master Wu said:** *摄* means "to govern" or "to oversee," as in *摄政*—to temporarily manage life as though it were a realm to be governed, without claiming it as one’s own. Dwelling in the realm of emptiness and stillness, presenting as gentle and weak, they are solid and unknowing like wood or stone, yet innocent and desireless like a babe. Even when confronted by fierce beasts or wicked men, they are untouched by harm.

For their impurities are dissolved,
their spirit and *qi* serene and tranquil—
like wind, like shadow—
nothing can grasp or seize them.
There is no substance in them that can die,
and even if harm comes their way,
how could it find purchase to wound them?

○ **Master Li said:** "Those without the place of death
are those who forget life and death."

○ **Master He said:** "Rhinoceros and tigers are spoken of as the most formidable of beasts—rhinoceros, the wild ox, weighing a thousand *jin*, with a single horn.

**Chapter Fifty-One:**
*The Dao* gives birth to life;
*virtue/power* nourishes it;
things take their form from it;
circumstances bring it to fruition."

Thus, all things reverence the *Dao* and hold *virtue/power* dear.

The *Dao*'s eminence and *virtue/power*'s nobility—
none command them yet they ever abide naturally.

**Master He said:** "The heavens cover with the *Dao* and all things are born;
each thing receives its *qi* from the heavens.
The earth bears with things and all things are nourished;
each thing receives its substance from the earth.
Thus, all things born possess their own forms and colors,
not awaiting external carving or refinement.
Yin and Yang intermingle, the four seasons succeed one another,
mutually giving life and taking it—
their *circumstances* thus come to fruition.
Who could resist them?

For form has its time of decline,
and *circumstances* have their time of collapse,
yet *Dao* and *virtue/power* endure in heaven and earth,
high and profound, eternal and unceasing,
unbroken and undying.

The *Yijing* says: *"Qián* governs with authority, *Kūn* conceals with capacity—
thus the *Dao* is supreme in eminence, with none to rival it.
*Virtue/power* is supreme in nobility, its height unmatched.
Though things differ in myriad ways,
none can compare to this.*

*Dao* and *virtue/power* transcend *circumstances* above,
yet move within form and *qi* below—
nothing lacks them, no time does without,
filling heaven and earth as the Eastern Cloth,
its fundamental essence universally acknowledged.
Not from deliberate decree,
nor from human contrivance—
its birth and nourishment are ever natural.
What is worthy of reverence and nobility
is also ever natural.

Yet the order of birth, nourishment, and formation—
though *Dao* and *virtue/power* and things and *circumstances* may differ,
they are ultimately spoken of as one *Dao*.

**Master Lin said:** "The *Dao* is natural and without;
all things conform to the void and thus are born,
hence it is said: *'The Dao gives birth to them.'*
*Virtue/power* then has its account,
hence it is said: *'Virtue/power nourishes them.'*
Nourish implies existence.
Things then have form,
hence it is said: *'Things take their form from it.'*
*Circumstances* imply correspondence,
hence it is said: *'Circumstances bring it to fruition.'*
Yin and Yang’s mutual pairing,
the four seasons’ mutual succession—
these are all *circumstances*.
'None command them yet they ever abide naturally'
is akin to saying: 'None make it so yet it is so.'
If there were no agency behind them,
they would be ever naturally constant.
Reverence and nobility speak of their transcendence above all things.

**Master Li said:** "The *Dao* originally has no form,
yet through its birth and nurturing of heaven and earth, form becomes visible.
The *Dao* originally has no name,
yet through its sustenance of all things, names begin to arise.
All things with form receive their mandate from heaven,
their shapes from earth,
their *qi* balanced and harmonized—
all are under the *Dao*'s influence,
hence all things reverence the *Dao* and hold *virtue/power* dear.
Thus, the *Dao* gives birth, nourishes, lengthens, and matures them,
covers and sustains them.
It births without possession,
acts without reliance,
lengthens without domination—
this is called the Mysterious *Virtue/power*.

**Master He said:** The *Zhuangzi* says: "The *Dao* is the common origin of all things;
those who lose it die, those who gain it live,
hence the *Dao* gives birth and nourishes them.
As the Way of Spring, it lengthens and nurtures them—
as the Way of Summer.
It brings to fruition and matures them—
as the Way of Autumn.
It sustains and covers them—
as the Way of Winter.
The *Gēngsāng Zǐ* says: 'Spring *qi* unfurls and all grasses are born,
just as Autumn arrives and all treasures are formed—
how could this not be so if they are gained?
The Great *Dao* has already gone forth—
this is it.
What *Dao* is this?
The void and natural *Dao*,
able to birth all things at their beginning,
yet also to shepherd and conceal all things at their end.
Heaven and Earth in motion and stillness—
without convergence and dispersion, they cannot arise or fade.
The *Gēngsāng Zǐ* thus reveals the Great *Dao* in Spring’s birth and Autumn’s fruition,
while Laozi unifies the arising and the covering in one *Dao*.
The *Yijing* says: 'It manifests in benevolence,
it conceals in utility—
thus is it.'

Heaven and Earth act without intent—
though they give birth, they do no harm,
yet claim no ownership;
though they act without refusal,
they do not boast of their deeds;
though they nurture without end,
they do not lord over others.
The seasons’ course—
when their work is done, they withdraw.
The Great Emptiness, profound and silent,
who could force a name upon it?

The Mysterious *Virtue/power*—
this is the Heavenly *Virtue/power*, the *Dao*.

**Master Lin said:** 'Lengthening and nurturing,
bringing to fruition and maturing,
sustaining and covering—
all speak of what comes after birth and existence.
Yet within heaven and earth,
endless birth and nurturing arise—
all from the power of transformation.
Yet transformation neither possesses nor claims ownership,
nor does it rely to boast of deeds,
though it lengthens all without a master’s intent—
this is why it is called the Mysterious and Marvelous *Virtue/power*.
The Mysterious *Virtue/power* is transformation itself.'

**Chapter Fifty-Two:**
The world has a beginning,
which serves as the world’s mother.
Having known its mother,
one knows its children;
having known its children,
one returns to guard its mother—
thus, no peril befalls the body.

**Master Lǚ said:** The *Liézǐ* speaks of *Tàiyì* (the Supreme Simplicity),
*Tàichū* (the Supreme Primordial),
*Tàishǐ* (the Supreme Beginning),
and *Tàisù* (the Supreme Purity).
*Tàiyì* is before *qi* appears,
*Tàichū* is the beginning of *qi*.
Now, the *Dao* originally had no beginning—
it envelops heaven and earth externally,
fills the cosmos internally,
formless and nameless,
the source from which all things draw their origin.
When it takes on names,
then things gain their means to be born.
There is a primal mixture formed,
before heaven and earth were born—
thus it is the world’s beginning.
It births and nurtures heaven and earth,
lengthens and sustains all things—
thus it is the world’s mother,
and all things are thus formed.

Take, for instance, the world within a single body:
its beginning stems from the Three Primordials nurturing *virtue/power*,
the Nine *qi* forming its shape.
Without the Three Primordials’ nurturing,
without the Nine *qi*’s guidance,
it could not be born—
thus it is the beginning-mother of a single body.
Hence it is said: *'The world has a beginning,
which serves as the world’s mother.'*

Having obtained its *qi*,
it becomes the mother of all limbs.
One must know its children—
the children are the spirit.
Having made the spirit the Original Spirit,
and the *qi* the Original *Qi*—
when the mother remains, the children endure;
when the mother departs, the children weep—
for the *qi* can birth the spirit,
while the spirit can subdue the *qi*.

The *Danjing* calls them *jūn-chén* (Lord-Subject),
or also *mǔ-zǐ* (Mother-Child).
The ancient True Persons say:
'When child and mother first meet, their affection springs like spring;
when Lord and Subject unite, their joy clusters like happiness.'

Within the form, Mother and Child dwell,
*Qi* guards the spirit, the spirit guards *Qi*;
in mutual affection they cling and blend,
united as one, forming the embryonic sage—
thus harmonized with Heaven, their essence complete.

Hence it is said:
Having obtained its Mother,
then know its Child,
Having known its Child,
then guard its Mother—
thus the body perishes not.

○ Lin Shi says:
*The world has a beginning,*
*which serves as the Mother*—
this is the Mother of all named things.
The Mother is *Zàohuà* (Creation),
the Child is all things.
Knowing Creation while also knowing all things,
knowing all things yet still knowing Creation—
for without *Wu* (Non-Being) there could be no *Yǒu* (Being),
while *Yǒu* arises from *Wu*.
Those who know *Yǒu* must not fail to know *Wu*—
to seek *Wu* with desire is to glimpse its mystery,
to seek *Yǒu* with desire is to grasp its limits.
This too is the meaning.
*"Thus the body perishes not"*—
meaning that so long as one abides thus,
there shall be no peril throughout life.

○ Dong Si Jing says:
Humans receive *Qi* to be born,
*Qi* as the Mother;
the spirit resides within *Qi*,
thus one must have the Child guard the Mother,
so that *Qi* may focus and the spirit be at ease.

○ He Shi says:
The Classic states:
*"Non-Being was the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
Being was the Mother of all things"*—
this is the meaning of the passage’s Beginning and Mother.
The *Taìshǐ* (Supreme Beginning) is merely *Wu* and *Yǒu*.
From *Wu* to *Yǒu* is the Mother,
as in *"The Dao gives birth to One"* is the way.
From *Yǒu* to *Yǒu* is the Child,
as in *"One generates Two, Two generates Three,
Three generates all things"* is the truth.

To **塞其兑** (*sè qí yuè*),
to **闭其门** (*bì qí mén*),
thus the body labors not its whole life.
To open **兑** (*yuè*),
to advance its affairs,
thus the body cannot be saved its whole life.

○ Lü Shi says:
*Qián* (Heaven) and *Kūn* (Earth) are the gates of the *Yì* (Changes),
opening and closing with regularity—
from them all hexagrams emerge.
The mechanism of birth and transformation
follows virtue’s measure without deviation.
*Yuè* (兑) means delight,
it means dispersion—
the pathways by which the ears and eyes
are drawn to colors and dust.
If one **塞** (*sè*) the love and delight
of sight and hearing,
then the gates of calamity and fortune are shut—
naturally, the body knows no labor.

Should one open the gates of love and delight
yet fail to **塞** (*sè*) them,
then the cravings of desire shall grow—
throughout life, peril and ruin shall be unavoidable.

By this analogy of oneself:
*Yuè* (兑) is the mouth,
the gate is the eyes—
constantly sealing the mouth,
then the Five *Qi*’s within solidify,
and the Original Essence does not dry.
Constantly dimming the eyes,
then the inner realm does not emerge,
and the outer realm does not intrude—
in stillness, supreme equanimity,
united with the Dao.

The *Shēntóng Qìè* (Parametric Agreement) says:
Ears and eyes are one’s treasures,
keep them sealed, do not let them shine.
Do not speak with the *Yuè* (兑) mouth,
nor seek the subtle with the coarse.
This is what is meant by:
**塞其兑, 闭其门**—
thus the body labors not its whole life.

Should one open the gates of delight
yet fail to **塞** (*sè*) them,
advance the affairs of desire
yet fail to **闭** (*bì*) them,
then external things shall entice,
and inner passions shall stir—
*Qi* shall dissipate, fluids shall leak,
and the spirit shall scatter.
Its spirit shall wither and die,
and none shall be able to save it—
thus it is said:
**开其兑, 济其事**—
throughout life, the body cannot be saved.

○ Lin Shi says:
*Yuè* (兑) is the mouth,
in the body there is a mouth,
in the home there is a gate—
all are metaphors for the place
from which all things emerge.

**塞其兑, 闭其门**—
to conceal *Yǒu* within *Wu* and not reveal it.
*"Thus the body labors not"*—
meaning success without toil.
To open **兑** (*yuè*)—
to emerge and put it to use.
To advance its affairs—
to use it and seek further benefit.
*"Thus peril and ruin shall be unavoidable."*

○ He Shi says:
The gate—
though ancient commentaries point to the mouth,
this is not rigid—
anything that has emergence and intrusion
may be called a gate.
To **闭其门** (*bì qí mén*)—
to obscure the mind with the Great Dao,
so that external thoughts do not enter,
and inner thoughts do not escape.
As in *Zhuāngzǐ* (Chuang Tzu):
*"If one’s heart rejects it,
then Heaven’s gate shall not open."*

Indeed, **塞兑闭门**—
to enter *Wu* and extinguish *Yǒu*,
for the Child to know the Mother,
is to return to the beginning,
and thus throughout life,
its application shall require no labor.

Should one open **兑** (*yuè*) and advance its affairs,
then with every thought and movement,
one shall stray from the original,
and ruin *Wu* while losing *Yǒu*—
as the Mother gives birth to the Child,
and entrusts it in myriad forms,
the Child grows strong while the Mother weakens,
the wheel turning endlessly—
throughout life, salvation shall be difficult.

○ Li Shi says:
**塞兑闭门**—
the inner realm does not emerge,
the outer realm does not intrude—
thus the body labors not,
and is governed without effort.
To open **兑** (*yuè*)—
the inner realm emerges,
the outer realm intrudes—
thus the body cannot be saved,
and the True Dao is forever lost.

*"Perceiving the small is clarity,"*
*"Guarding the soft is strength."*
Using its light,
then returning to its clarity—
no harm shall come to the body.

This is called **袭常** (*xí cháng*).

○ Lin Shi says:
What one perceives is vast,
yet if one can gather and make it small,
then it is supreme clarity.
What one governs is rigid,
yet if one can retreat and guard the soft,
then it is supreme strength.
Thus, not self-asserting is clarity,
not self-aggrandizing is longevity.

Light is the application of clarity,
clarity is the essence of light—
to use its light and return it to clarity,
then there shall be no blame.
To know its application yet not know concealment,
is the way of inviting harm.
**袭** (*xí*) means concealment,
**常** (*cháng*) means unchanging—
**袭常** (*xí cháng*) means
to conceal its application and not exhaust it.

○ He Shi says:
All who can be great yet cannot be small,
strong yet cannot be weak,
clear yet cannot be obscure,
then they abandon the root for the branches—
the Child generates another Child,
endlessly drifting, forgetting to return—
what then of the Mother?
This is the way of inviting harm.

The Beginning is the Dao of constant *Wu*,
the Mother is the Dao of constant *Yǒu*—
from *Wu* arises *Yǒu*,
from *Yǒu* returns to *Wu*—
this is the unchanging Great Dao.

It is also said:
*"Using light yet returning to clarity—*
the sage shines without dazzling."
*"Observing deep fish is an ill omen."*

○ Lü Shi says:
The reflection of water
illuminating things is called light,
its essence is called clarity—
to use its light of external illumination,
then to withdraw and reflect inward,
returning and concealing it within,
is to grasp its essence.

The spirit, when overused, is exhausted.
To gaze upon deep fish is an ill omen—
this is the harm of expending light outward while neglecting the self.

If one can contain the light and blend with the world,
then no harm befalls the self.
This is called grasping the constant light’s use
and returning to the constant essence of clarity—
thus it is said: *"Cling to the constant."*

**Chapter Fifty-Three**
*"If I were suddenly to know,*
walking the Great Dao,
I would fear only *shī*."*

○ **Wu Shi says:**
*"I"* refers generally to all people, not Laozi speaking of himself.
*"Jié"* sounds like *jié*—as in *Mencius*’ *"Jiérán yòng zhī ér chéng lù"* (to act swiftly and complete the path).
The word *"zhī"* cuts off *shī* as in *"The Analects’* *‘wú shī láo’* (without bestowing favors),
and *Mencius’* *‘shīshī cóng wài lái zhī shī’* (the ostentatious bestowal of favors from without, boastful and grand).
The sage’s Preface: Yanzi was *"having-yet-as-if-not-having,"*
*"being-yet-as-if-empty"*—
without bestowing favors, just as Laozi’s use was.
He magnified what he feared—
this chapter speaks of those who do not know the Dao,
who only seek to boast,
so that if such a person were suddenly to know,
and wished to walk the Great Dao,
he would fear only *shī* and dare not act.

○ **Li Shi says:**
*"Fear only shī"*—those who recognize the law fear it.

○ **Chái Shi says:**
All who walk outside the Great Dao are to be feared.

The Great Dao is most level,
yet people prefer byways.

○ **Wu Shi says:**
Byways are narrow paths,
contrary to the Great Dao.
The truly humble, withdrawing, is the Great Dao—
its way is flat and easy to walk,
yet the boastful and ostentatious are the byways.
And people love to tread them.

○ **Lü Shi says:**
The Great Dao is a broad, open thoroughfare,
level and unobstructed—wherever one goes, it is passable.
Though distant as thousands of miles,
one must begin with the step beneath one’s feet.
The sage fears overstraightness,
hesitating before action—
does he value swift arrival or seek near-term gain?
The world values swift arrival,
so they take shortcuts.
Yet they stumble, confused, unaware of their destination,
moving backward, acting contrary—
the farther they stray from the Dao,
the less chance they have of ascending.
The Dao of refining and nurturing is level as a whetstone,
easy to know and easy to walk.
A narrow-minded scholar, stuck in a corner,
wants quick results,
so he wanders through side doors,
falls into crooked paths,
and does not realize it.
Thus it is said:
*The Great Dao is most level,*
*yet people prefer byways.*

○ **Hé Shi says:**
The Great Dao is level like a great road,
yet if one abandons it for crooked paths,
one becomes deeply lost.
The court is well-ordered,
the fields lie fallow,
the granaries are empty,
yet they adorn themselves in fine silks,
wear sharp blades at their sides,
gluttonously indulge in food and drink,
hoard wealth—
this is called *thieving boastfulness.*
How can this be the Dao?

○ **Wu Shi says:**
This speaks of boastful deeds—
the court is not swept clean,
the fields lie untended—
the people are forced to labor without rest,
their strength drained, their stores depleted.
They adorn themselves with fine ornaments,
fill their tables with rich foods,
plunder their treasuries for wealth—
this is like a thief,
proud of his spoils,
displaying them outwardly.
Like Xia’s Jie and Shang’s Xin—
how could one who knows the Dao do such things?

○ **Lín Shi says:**
The Great Dao is level,
yet people seeking it do not walk the straight path,
preferring crooked byways.
It is like a ruler who orders his court splendidly—
palaces and towers built in splendor.
Though the court is beautiful,
the fields lie fallow,
the granaries are empty,
yet they adorn themselves in embroidered robes,
wear sharp blades,
overindulge in food and drink,
hoard wealth,
striving for riches and strength—
this is like a thief boasting of his prowess.
How long can this last?
This is a parable:
Those who do not know the Great Dao
yet boast of their cleverness and learning—
these are the ones who love byways.

「How could one know the **至道** (*Zhìdào*, the Ultimate Dao/Way)?
That is why it is said: *"This is not the Dao!"*

○ **Master He says:**
*"朝甚除"* (*cháo shèn chú*—this is "clearing") refers to **修治** (*xiūzhì*, cultivation and rectification).
The **传** (*transmission*) states: *"Remove the dung from the ancestral hall"*—and again, *"clear the path"*—both meaning **cultivation and rectification**.

**Chapter Fifty-Four:**
*"The wise builder does not uproot,
the wise embrace does not sever;
sacrifice to the ancestral spirits never ceases."*

○ **Master Lü says:**
Those who skillfully establish a state by the Dao/Way
stand alone above all things,
unchanging through all ages,
soaring beyond all things,
yet never reaching an end.
If one establishes oneself by this Dao/Way
and governs the world by this Dao/Way,
holding fast to its **中** (*zhōng*, central harmony),
embodying its **常** (*cháng*, constancy),
and anchoring it in the nameless **朴** (*pǔ*, primal simplicity),
then one will not be swayed by the transformations of things.
Blessings extend to future generations,
virtue grows ever broader,
its efficacy ever greater—
unshakable indeed.

But if one relies on **根技** (*gēnjì*, rooting in skills and artifices),
**氣** (*qì*) will be exhausted,
and the **青** (*qīng*, vital essence) will leave the **木** (*mù*, body).
If **炁** (*qì*) decays,
**精** (*jīng*, essence) will be exhausted,
and **神明** (*shénmíng*, spirit and luminosity) will depart from the body.
Thus, the **至人** (*Zhìrén*, Perfect Sage) firmly cultivates deep roots,
standing alone in the vast wilderness,
the realm of **無何有** (*wúhéyǒu*, the boundless),
endless and unyielding—
immovable, never uprooted.

Those who skillfully embrace the people by the Dao/Way
ride the harmony of Heaven and Earth,
command the subtleties of the **六氣** (*liùqì*, Six Qi),
and the scholars of the world
settle into **一心** (*yīxīn*, singular purpose).
Thus, the people naturally gather in devotion.

Cultivating **一己** (*yījǐ*, oneself alone)
is to embrace the **元** (*yuán*, primal origin) and guard the **一** (*yī*, singularity),
preserving **神** (*shén*, spirit) and returning **精** (*jīng*, essence),
as the winds of **回風** (*huífēng*, circulating breath) blend in the **丹田** (*dāntián*, elixir field).
There will be no severance, everlasting.

That is why it is said:
*"The wise embrace does not sever."*

But those who skillfully establish and embrace—
is it not that they do more than just remain unrooted and unsevered?
Their virtue and grace flow through all levels,
filial piety and compassion extend to their descendants,
and their lineage endures without limit—
is this not beautiful?

○ **Master He says:**
In the **《庄子》** (*Zhuāngzǐ*, Chuang Tzu),
the state of **"建德之国"** (*Jiàndé zhī guó*, the state built by virtue)*
has citizens who are simple and unsophisticated.
Thus, those who speak of **善建** (*shànjiàn*, wise establishment)
do not add to virtue—
then people will also stand with them, never uprooted.

The **经** (*classic*) says:
*"Embrace the One as the model for all under Heaven,"*
so those who speak of **善抱** (*shànbào*, wise embrace)
do not stray from the One—
then people will not abandon their hearts and be severed.

It is not merely in oneself,
but descendants will also rejoice and inherit it,
their sacrifices stretching far into the future.

Those who observe the Dao/Way
do not selfishly act for their descendants alone,
but establish teachings for the ages,
not speaking only to those who dwell in mountains and valleys.
It is said:
*"Great virtue must gain its rewards—rank, position, longevity—
and the ancestral temples will enjoy them,
the descendants will preserve them."*

○ **Master Lín says:**
The builder who does not establish virtue
will be uprooted,
the embrace that does not hold simplicity
will be severed.
But if one establishes virtue and embraces simplicity,
then there will be no uprooting or severing.

For households with descendants,
sacrifice will never cease.

The Dao/Way gives birth to the **一** (*yī*, One),
the One generates the **二** (*èr*, Two),
the Two gives rise to the **三** (*sān*, Three),
and the Three produces **萬物** (*wànwù*, all things).
All things are born yet never exhausted—
just as descendants perpetuate a family.

These three sentences are parables,
speaking of the Dao/Way’s enduring presence
though it seems without limits.

Cultivate it in oneself—
then virtue is **真** (*zhēn*, true).
Cultivate it in the family—
then virtue has **余** (*yú*, surplus blessings).
Cultivate it in the village—
then virtue is **長** (*cháng*, enduring).
Cultivate it in the state—
then virtue is **豐** (*fēng*, abundant).
Cultivate it in the world—
then virtue is **普** (*pǔ*, universal).

○ **Master Lü says:**
The Dao/Way of cultivating oneself
in every action, every response,
every adaptation and transformation—
it never fails to begin with oneself.
Refining **氣** (*qì*) and nourishing **神** (*shén*),
few desires and little self-interest,
all falsehoods exhausted—
then one becomes a **真人** (*Zhēnrén*, True Sage).

Cultivate it in the family—
then the father is kind, the son filial,
the elder brother friendly, the younger respectful,
and the nine clans harmonious.
Accumulating virtue with surplus,
joy flows into future generations.

Cultivate it in the village—
then the aged are honored,
the ignorant are taught,
and trust flows upward and downward.
Virtue endures for ages.

Cultivate it in the state—
then all officials fulfill their duties,
calamities do not arise,
and all treasures flourish in abundance.
Things are filled and complete.

Cultivate it in the world—
then there is governance without teaching,
transformation without words,
harmony with the Great Way,
and even common households may be ennobled.
Virtue spreads far and wide.

If one cultivates in family, village, state, and world—
speaking of virtue as surplus, enduring, abundant, and universal—
only in cultivating oneself
does one speak of virtue as **真** (*true*).
This is what **《庄子》** (*Zhuāngzǐ*) means:
*"The Dao’s true virtue is for cultivating oneself,
its lingering traces and scattered benefits
are for governing the world."*

The root lies in oneself,
the branches extend outward—
the principle is complete.

○ **Master Lín says:**
Cultivating oneself—
virtue is real and without falsehood.
Cultivating the family—
virtue accumulates with surplus blessings.
Cultivating the village—
virtue is what the village holds in honor.
Cultivating the state—
virtue extends to more people, ever greater.
Cultivating the world—
virtue reaches ever more widely.

○ **Master Wú says:**
The Dao’s true virtue is for cultivating oneself,
its lingering traces and scattered benefits
are for governing the people.

The **家** (*jiā*, family) is beyond oneself,
within the nine clans.
The **鄉** (*xiāng*, village) is beyond the family,
within the extended neighborhood.
The **國** (*guó*, state) is beyond the village,
within the national borders.

The **天下** (*tiānxià*, world) is beyond the state,
within the four seas.
Those who cultivate in family, village, state, and world—
speaking of near and far,
each person cultivates their own virtue.

Yet is this something taught to all?
No—
*"I act without action,
and the people are naturally transformed."*

○ **Master He says:**
Within, in oneself and the family,
cultivating by this Dao/Way
brings true virtue, accumulated strength, and lasting power—
and even surplus remains.

Without, in village, state, and world,
cultivating by this Dao/Way
makes the source deep and the flow long—
abundant and universal.

Thus, observe oneself by oneself,
observe the family by the family,
observe the village by the village,
observe the state by the state,
observe the world by the world.

How do I know this of the world?
By this.

○ **Master Lín says:**
Take my own body,
and you can observe others’ bodies.
Take my own family,
and you can observe others’ families.
Take my own village,
and you can observe others’ villages.
Extend this to state and world—
all the same.
The Dao’s applications are universal.»

「Thus, the principle by which one observes is the Dao/Way itself—
by observing through the Dao/Way, nothing in the world fails to align.

○ **Master Lǐ says:**
When applied to cultivating oneself,
observe the heart and examine the nature—
a settled heart ensures the body’s cultivation.
When applied to governing the state,
observe the people and reflect upon oneself—
if the people are transformed, then the state is well-governed.
If there is even one unvirtuous act in the world,
then it is due to one’s own governance and transformation being flawed.
The *Shū* [Classic of Documents] states:
*"If the people have faults,
they lie with me alone."*
This is the meaning.

When one looks inward at all the hearts within,
there is even a speck of dust or attachment,
then it is my own innate nature that remains unclear.

○ **Master Dǒng says:**
The method of observation is not distant—
why seek it elsewhere?
Though the divisions of things may differ,
their root is singular.
Observing by this principle,
nothing fails to align—
this insight must resonate beyond mere words.

**Chapter 55 of *Jìyì* [Collected Meanings] in *Zhēnchūn Dàodé* [True Purity Daoist Virtue]**
*"The depth of virtue/power is like that of an infant."*

○ **Master Lǐ says:**
*"Virtue/power"* here means
to hold it in reserve without revealing it.
*"Depth"* is the utmost degree—
when virtue/power is held to its utmost,
it is like that of an infant.

○ **Master Hé says:**
A true man of virtue/power
dwells in its depth, not its shallowness—
thus, profound virtue/power is the affair of the great.
Preserving the essence and safeguarding the qi,
grasping the vital breath and harmonizing the flow—
the great indeed does not lose
the heart of the infant.

○ **Master Lǐ says:**
*"The depth of virtue/power is like that of an infant"*—
it means not losing the heart of the infant.

○ **Master Wú says:**
One who contains within himself
the utmost depth of virtue/power
is like a newborn babe.
The previous section states:
*"Specializing in the vital qi to utmost softness,
able to be like an infant,
constant virtue/power does not depart,
returning again to the infant."*
Mencius said:
*"The great man does not lose the heart of the infant."*

○ **Master Sū says:**
When Laozi speaks of *Dàodé* [Daoist Virtue],
he often compares it to an infant—
meaning its essence precedes its application.

○ **Master Lǖ says:**
The sage embraces the Dao/Way and holds virtue/power within,
deep, profound, and pure—
without action or affairs,
his will undivided,
his spirit concentrated,
like that of an infant.
The infant is taken from
its initial birth color as a metaphor.

Again, it is said:
*"The infant of the highest realm is a clay pellet,*
a name of the Celestial Sovereign."
Naturally holding within,
true and pure without dissipation,
like the infant before it knows of worldly ways.
Poisonous creatures do not sting,
ferocious beasts do not seize,
raptors do not strike.

○ **Master Lǐ says:**
*"Poisonous creatures do not sting,
ferocious beasts do not seize,
raptors do not strike"*—
meaning nothing can harm him,
also implying *"enter water and not be wet,
enter fire and not be scorched."*

○ **Master Wú says:**
Poisonous creatures—
bees and wasps of their kind—
sting with their tail ends.
Ferocious beasts—
tigers and leopards—
seize with their claws and paws.
Raptors—
hawks and falcons—
strike with their wings and talons.

○ **Master Dǒng says:**
The complete man of the world
is harmed by nothing.

○ **Master Hé says:**
Profoundly containing virtue/power,
not revealing it outwardly,
harmony exists between oneself and all things—
thus, nothing can harm him,
and nothing can harm others.

○ **Master Lǐ says:**
The infant’s heart is pure,
harming nothing,
and nothing can harm it.

○ **Master Sū says:**
The infant’s heart is without intent,
and figures without heart cannot oppose it—
how then could they harm it?

○ **Master Lǖ says:**
The perfect man’s spirit is whole,
his Dao/Way profound—
piercing metal and stone,
sitting he vanishes, standing he endures,
driving dragons and subduing tigers,
commanding ghosts and controlling demons.
Poisonous creatures dare not unleash their sting,
ferocious beasts cannot employ their claws and teeth,
raptors cannot exert their talons and wings.
Though his bones are frail and sinews soft,
his grasp is firm—
before knowing of union between male and female,
yet his essence is already stirring—
the utmost of essence.
Crying all day yet his voice never breaks—
the utmost of harmony.

○ **Master Lǐ says:**
The infant’s bones are most frail,
his sinews most soft,
yet his grip is firm—
before knowing of male and female,
yet his essence is already stirring—
his essence and qi are full.
Essence, the infant’s vital root.
Though he cries all day,
his throat is not hoarse—
his heart knows no joy or anger,
his qi is inherently harmonious.
Hoarse, a reversal of breath.
The infant’s purity and singularity are fixed—
thus he can be so.
Yet those with the Dao/Way are also so—
it is simply that their hearts do not move.

○ **Master Hé says:**
Essence—
the infant’s yin.
At birth, sinews and bones are unlabored,
soft and supple—
yet his grasp is firm,
while his yin and yang already surge.
Not from knowing of male and female desire,
but from the abundance of his essence and qi.
Yet one with virtue/power
preserves essence, qi, and spirit—
accumulating to the point of transforming sinews, bones, and form—
approaching this likeness.
Hoarse—
a broken voice—
though he cries all day,
his voice does not break—
from the completeness of his harmonious qi.
Yet one with virtue/power
respects without delight,
is insulted without anger—
approaching the likeness of the natural harmony.

○ **Master Lǐ says:**
Unknowing of male and female distinction,
yet his essence is already stirring—
his essence and qi are whole.
Though stirring, he is without intent—
thus he preserves his utmost essence,
crying all day yet his voice does not change—
from the harmony of the vital breath.
Cultivate the body by this principle,
preserve its purity and wholeness—
thus it is called
the depth of virtue/power.

*"Knowing harmony is constancy,
knowing constancy is clarity,
enhancing life is auspicious,
moving the heart to stir the qi is force."*

○ **Master Lǐ says:**
Harmony is the preservation of pure qi.
Knowing this utmost harmony,
one can endure without change.
Knowing this principle of enduring,
one can be said to be clear in the Dao/Way.
Life cannot be enhanced by force—
seeking to enhance it brings calamity.
Auspicious—
auspiciousness is the same as *xiáng* [auspicious].
The saying goes:
*"What auspiciousness is this?"*
meaning the intent of this *xiáng* character.
To move the heart and stir the qi—
this is the will affecting the breath.
Force is violence—
violence is not the Dao/Way—
thus, moving the heart to stir the qi is force.»

「○ **Master Hé says:**
The sun and moon never cease their course,
yet they bring spring to all things—
how can they remain constant?
It is harmony.

Good and evil, beauty and ugliness—
they do not dwell in the spirit storehouse,
how can they be so clear?
It is constancy.

Human life is bounded—
to seek enhancement brings disaster.
Huìzǐ said: *"How can one have a body if one does not enhance life?"*
The *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *"Words do not harm the body by their own good or evil;
constancy follows nature without enhancement."*

Again, it says: *"Excess is enhancement."*

Thus, *"There is no way to enhance life"*—
this is the virtue/power of transcending attachment to life.

Like eating in excess or indulging in superfluous actions,
this would be the auspiciousness of monstrousness and wickedness.

The will is the master of the *qi*,
and the *qi* is the essence that fills the body—
if the will stirs the *qi*,
then the *qi* in turn agitates the will,
becoming fierce and narrow in its violence.

○ **Master Lǚ says:**
Harmony is nourishing oneself with uprightness,
from the beginning free of the calamities of straining or deviating.
How could one harm oneself by such violence and lose constancy?

Having known harmony,
one never loses what one preserves—
calm and unified without change,
one aligns with the constancy of Heaven and Earth.
Having known the Dao/Way of constancy,
one awakens to the singular,
neither ancient nor modern,
illuminated and boundless,
sharing radiance with the sun and moon.

Thus, *"Knowing harmony is constancy,
knowing constancy is clarity."*

Yet, if called divine,
how could one not be burdened by life?
If one does not enhance life according to principle,
disaster will surely come—
thus there is ruin in clinging to delusion.

If called *qi*,
how could one not be swayed by the will?
When *qi* and blood act wildly,
violence grows ever more extreme—
thus one is drowned in perversity.

If one does not know the Dao/Way of constancy,
life’s disasters will come.
To gather *qi* in utmost softness,
to embrace the principle of life—
now, if the will instead enslaves the *qi*,
and the *qi* becomes bold and violent,
how could this be the Dao/Way?

Only those who know the Dao/Way
follow nature without enhancing life.

When things grow strong, they age—
this is called *"not the Dao/Way"*.
*"Not the Dao/Way"* brings early demise.

○ **Master Lǚ says:**
When things grow strong, they must age,
when the will is violent, disaster follows—
yet the Dao/Way uses softness and weakness to preserve virtue/power.
If one instead takes strength and violence as the will,
this is *"not the Dao/Way"*—
thus, *"not the Dao/Way"* brings early demise.

Among all things, humans are the most refined—
there is life, then youth,
youth, then vigor,
vigor, then aging,
aging, then death—
these are all those who do not know the Dao/Way
and cannot escape the workings of *造化* [Creation-Transformation].
If one could seize the mechanism of Heaven and Earth,
grasp the subtlety of *阴阳还返* [Yin-Yang return and reversal],
then form could avoid birth,
spirit could avoid change—
one’s fate lies within oneself,
no longer bound to Heaven and Earth.

If one has not yet attained this,
how could one avoid growing strong?
Thus, *"When things grow strong, they age"*—
this is called *"not the Dao/Way"*,
and *"not the Dao/Way"* brings early demise.

○ **Master Wú says:**
Constancy is like that of an infant—
then there is no strength,
how could there be aging?
If one does not age,
how could one perish?

○ **Master Hé says:**
Those who cultivate virtue/power wisely
understand that discernment lies in early action—
their harmony remains unshaken by external affairs,
thus their virtue/power is complete and their spirit undiminished,
the reason they embody the depth of virtue/power—
they do not see the three shifts of youth, vigor, and aging.

**Chapter 56:**
*"The wise do not speak,
speakers lack wisdom."*」

「Block its mouth, close its gate,
dull its sharpness, resolve its chaos,
soften its radiance, blend with the dust—
this is called *Mysterious Unity*.

○ **Master Lín says:**
*"The wise do not speak"* and *"speakers lack wisdom"*—
this means the Dao/Way cannot be contained in words.
One must block its mouth and close its gate,
and hide it in secrecy,
must dull its sharpness and grind it smooth,
so that it has no jagged edges,
must resolve its chaos and harmonize it,
so that it is not disordered,
must soften its radiance and blend with the dust,
so that it does not dazzle or reveal itself—
this is the *uttermost Mysterious* and *uttermost Marvelous*,
the principle of Unity that is naturally so.
○ **Master Hé says:**
Knowing the Dao/Way is easy,
but speaking of it is difficult.
To know and not speak—
this is Heaven.
To know and yet speak—
this is humanity.
The ancients were Heavenly yet not human.
The Dao/Way is naturally born,
those who practice can attain it,
those who hear can speak of it.
Those who know the Dao/Way, because its depth and subtlety,
do not speak of it.
Those who do not know the Dao/Way, because its complexity,
cannot comprehend it.

To block its mouth is to take pleasure not in the Dao/Way,
but in what is contrary to it.
To close its gate is to follow not the Dao/Way,
but what is contrary to it.
To dull its sharpness is to break the jagged angles of danger and height.
To resolve its chaos is to escape the entangling web of false views.
To soften its radiance is to guard wisdom as if one were foolish.
To blend with the dust is to forget contrivance and mingle with the common.

These six things must be done in accordance with the Dao/Way,
then one returns to the True and preserves the body,
can penetrate its Mysterious virtue/power,
and associate with Heaven—
thus it is called *Mysterious Unity*.
○ **Master Lǚ says:**
The subtleties of creating the Dao/Way
do not align with the functions of yin and yang,
transcending the limits of form and number.
Above, it associates with the Originators of transformation,
below, it befriends those who dwell beyond life and death,
without beginning or end.
Without external attachments to things,
how could one be close to them?
Without seeking what is evil,
how could one be distant from them?
Without seeking in utility,
benefit cannot intrude upon one.
Without a mind toward things,
harm cannot reach one.
High rank and great wealth
cannot stir one’s heart—
this is not valuing honor as nobility.
To be stained with shame and disgrace
cannot alter one’s resolve—
this is not valuing defilement as lowliness.
One can preserve life and nourish form,
this is the Dao/Way’s *supreme height and extremity*.
Even the world cannot attain it—
thus it is the most noble.

○ **Master Wú says:**
If I have attained *Mysterious Unity*,
then I cannot be close or distant,
beneficial or harmful,
noble or lowly to others.
Grace, though like that of parents,
is forgotten by people when given—
thus I cannot be close to them.
Distant like a passing traveler,
yet people do not recognize or keep their distance—
thus I cannot be distant from them.
External fame, rank, wealth, and goods
cannot truly benefit others—
thus I cannot be beneficial to them.
External life, death, calamity, and fortune
cannot truly harm others—
thus I cannot be harmful to them.
Power, though like that of a ruler,
is treated familiarly by people—
thus I cannot be noble to them.
Insignificant like a commoner,
yet people cannot belittle me—
thus I cannot be lowly to them.
All these six things,
others cannot do,
yet I alone can—
thus I am the most noble in the world.

**Chapter 57:**
Govern the state with uprightness,
employ the strange in warfare,
acquire the world with non-action.
How do I know this is so?
From this.

○ **Master Lǚ says:**
Uprightness is the Dao/Way’s constancy,
the strange is its variation,
non-action is its truth.
To govern with uprightness is to fulfill the Dao/Way of ruling,
to employ the strange in warfare is to respond to the changes of the time.
The ancient sages established foundations that could endure and grow great,
not originally intending to use warfare.
When forced to act, there were campaigns and battles—
thus, governance is uprightness,
and warfare is the strange.

The world is a divine instrument that cannot be forced.
Those who force it ruin it,
those who grasp it lose it.
To acquire the world is always through non-action.
When there is action,
it is insufficient to acquire the world.
Only those who embody the Dao/Way remain serene and non-acting,
following things naturally,
thinking nothing, deliberating nothing—
even if they do not acquire the world,
the world naturally returns to them.

Speaking of oneself,
when the heart is balanced and the will steadfast,
when *qi* and blood flow harmoniously,
then external evils do not intrude,
and the natural divine realm is serene and settled—
the luminous light of Heaven shines forth,
just as the practice of governing the state
in accordance with the Dao/Way
brings peace to the borders.»

If the Six Bandits have not been eliminated and the Seven Emotions not dispelled,
then my body’s afflictions still linger.
When dusty thoughts arise and karmic fires blaze,
this is the time of *no choice*—
to wield arms without resorting to slaughter is impossible,
to unleash killing intent without striking is impossible—
just as the four barbarian tribes and eight frontier tribes
invade China in turn,
and the Six Armies cannot restrain themselves.

Thus it is said:
*"To govern with virtue/power, to use the strange in war,
to acquire the world through non-action."*
But how can one know the intentions of Heaven and humanity?
It is seen through the affairs of governing the state,
of wielding arms,
and of acquiring the world.

○ Master Wu said:
*"Virtue/power"* refers to laws, statutes, and prohibitions—
to correct what is incorrect is its meaning.
The disciples of Guan Zhong and Shang Yang
governed with *virtue/power.*

The sovereign’s governance of the state,
however, takes *cultivating oneself and harmonizing the family*
as its foundation,
and does not rely on laws, statutes, and prohibitions
to establish *virtue/power.*

*"The strange"* refers to stratagems and deceits—
its meaning is cunning yet not upright.
The disciples of Sun Bin and Wu Qi
employed *the strange* in war.

The sovereign’s use of war,
however, takes *relieving the people and punishing crimes*
as its intent,
and does not prize stratagems and deceits
to achieve *the strange.*
Thus *the strange* may only be applied to war,
but not to governing the state,
and *virtue/power* may only be applied to governing the state,
but not to acquiring the world.

*Non-action* refers to the Three Sovereigns’ governance of non-doing—
like Heaven which does not speak,
yet the four seasons proceed and myriad things flourish,
without expecting humanity’s obedience,
yet the world has none who do not obey.
Thus only *non-action* can acquire the world.

○ Master Lin said:
*"To govern with virtue/power, to use the strange in war—*
this speaks of governance requiring administration,
and war requiring deceit.
Both are acts of deliberate intent.
But to act without acting,
this can win the world’s heart.
Hence it is said:
*‘To acquire the world through non-action.’*
I do not know why deliberate intent is unworkable,
while non-intent is effective—
this is the Dao/Way of it.

The world abounds in taboos and prohibitions,
yet the people grow ever poorer.
Humans multiply sharp tools,
yet the state grows ever more corrupt.

The people multiply in cleverness and artifice,
and strange things arise in abundance.
Laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,
yet thieves and robbers abound.

Master Lü said:
*"The cause of the people’s poverty and wealth,
longevity and early demise,
lies in their own nature,
without the ruler’s interference.
If the net of prohibitions is dense and strict,
the people grow ever more cautious and evasive,
their actions falter, and their livelihoods decline,
day by day growing poorer and more destitute.
Thus, the Sage’s engagement with the world
is rooted in *non-doing* as the true foundation,
while *doing* is but a responsive measure.
Whether doing or not doing,
the Sage remains steadfast in the foundation,
like one amid the clamor without resentment,
entangled in affairs yet without vexation—
this is the true foundation,
where *non-doing* and *non-thought* are constant.*

Moreover, the heart is like a sovereign,
while *qi* is like the people.
Excessive prohibitions unsettle the heart,
and the primal *qi* is scattered and diminished—
hence it is said:
*"The world abounds in taboos,
and the people grow ever poorer."*

Sharp tools are but instruments of authority,
the ruler’s axes and hatchets—
how can subjects wield them?
Even a single man’s tool,
when shared by all,
is like reversing the *Tà’ē* hilt
and giving the handle to another.
Once authority is surrendered,
the state falls into chaos.
As for oneself,
if the heart cannot remain pure and undivided,
but is instead controlled by the seven emotions and six desires,
how can clarity and wisdom not grow dim?
Hence it is said:
*"The people multiply in sharp tools,
and the state grows ever more corrupt."*

Clever artifice is but refined craftsmanship—
when rulers cannot refrain from action,
and their minds turn to licentious excess,
the people fashion intricate carvings,
ornaments of gold and jade,
strange and wondrous things,
to curry favor and indulge their desires.
For oneself,
if one cannot abandon worldly attachments
and instead drowns in sensory pleasures,
day by day growing deeper in indulgence,
then the Great Simplicity is dissipated,
and the Dao/Way is lost.
Hence it is said:
*"The people multiply in cleverness and artifice,
and strange things arise in abundance."*

Laws and decrees are but instruments of punishment and instruction—
if they are excessive and harsh,
those who manipulate words and laws will thrive in their wickedness,
while the people cannot bear the burden.
The small result in theft of wealth,
the great in theft of the state itself.
For oneself,
if one is ensnared by petty laws,
clinging to trifling rules,
while external distractions multiply,
the heart grows restless and disordered—
plundering one’s true nature,
robbing one’s innate purity—
such is the chaos wrought.
Hence it is said:
*"Laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,
yet thieves and robbers abound."*

Master He said:
*"The world abounds in taboos,
and the people grow ever poorer"—
this speaks of the state’s many restrictions.
Mountains and marshes each have their keepers,
markets and passes each have their tolls,
taxes without measure,
the people burdened and weary.
As when Yanzi answered Duke Jiao of Qi,
‘Every touch incurs a prohibition,
the people cannot endure it’—
is this not the case of excessive taboos making the people ever poorer?
Fewer prohibitions mean peaceful livelihoods.
The Classics say:
‘The state’s sharp tools
should not be displayed to the people.’
If the people multiply in sharp tools,
then the state grows ever more corrupt—
for fear they will seize the ruler’s authority.
Hence it is said:
‘The craftsman should not indulge in excessive cleverness,
for his tools will then be complete yet undecorated.’
If the people multiply in clever artifice,
strange things arise in abundance—
this is to fear the corruption of simplicity and virtue.
If the ruler issues no harsh decrees,
his affairs proceed without disturbance,
but if the net is dense and the laws severe,
wickedness cannot be contained,
and the people will turn to thieves and robbers—
this is to fear the overreach of laws.
Thus one understands further:
‘My non-doing, and the people transform themselves,
my love of stillness, and the people align themselves,
my non-interference, and the people grow rich,
my absence of desire, and the people return to simplicity.’
The ancient sages did not deceive me.

Master Li said:
*"Excessive taboos,
excessive sharp tools,
excessive clever artifice,
excessive laws and decrees—
all are unnatural.
Fewer taboos, and the people prosper,
abolish schemes of gain, and the people transform,
reduce taxes and levies, and the people grow rich,
guide them with virtue/power, and the people return to simplicity.
Hence the sages say:
‘I do not act, and the people transform themselves,
I love stillness, and the people align themselves,
I do not interfere, and the people grow rich,
I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.’

Master Lü said:
‘The Venerable Lord is the progenitor of ten thousand teachings,
yet still he upholds the words of the ancient sages—
“Guarding through humility,
not daring to reveal oneself.”
Thus, having state and people,
he makes no artificial constructions,
never failing to govern through non-doing,
so the people fulfill their natural lives,
and the common folk transform themselves.

The alchemists of the True One,
treat myself as the spirit,
and the people as *qi*.
Spirit condenses through non-doing,
primal *qi* transforms into fluid,
fluid into blood,
blood into sinew,
sinew into bone,
bone into marrow,
marrow into essence,
essence into the Mysterious Pearl,
the Mysterious Pearl into Golden Elixir.
This is what the *Yīnfǔ Jīng* calls
‘ten thousand transformations born from the body.’
Hence it is said:
‘I do not act, and the people transform themselves.’

Moderate use and cherish the people,
reject ornamentation and uphold substance—
never failing to prioritize frugality,
the people grow rich in their livelihoods,
and their homes prosper naturally.
The alchemists of the True One,
constantly without desire, endure long life—
enduring long life, *qi* fills the Three Fields within,
hence it is said:
‘I do not interfere, and the people grow rich.’

Peaceful and still, unspeaking,
simple and undisturbed in self-cultivation—
never failing to uphold the root of virtue/power,
the people embrace Heaven’s completeness,
and their customs become pure and correct.
If the human spirit is restless and agitated,
then *qi* becomes coarse and abrupt,
but if the spirit is tranquil and at ease,
all gates flow harmoniously,
and the primal *qi* aligns itself.
Hence it is said:
‘I love stillness, and the people align themselves.’

Without desire, empty and boundless,
venerating the root and discarding the superficial—
never failing to pursue simplicity,
the people rise in aspiration,
and their nature returns to simplicity.
The alchemists of the True One,
with the primal spirit serene and undisturbed,
desire unarisen,
*qi* refined and spirit condensed,
form the embryo and take shape—
hence it is said:
‘I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.’

Master He said:
‘*I do not act, and the people transform themselves*—
if one acts, it ruins them,
and the people will not transform.
*I love stillness, and the people align themselves*—
if one agitates and loses it,
the people will not align.
*I do not interfere, and the people grow rich*—
if one seeks contention, one invites calamity,
and the people will not grow rich.’"

I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity—
if one harbors many desires, one brings many burdens,
and the people will not return to simplicity.
This is the essential Dao of supreme governance.

In ancient times, Master Guai excelled in governing with the Yellow Emperor’s teachings.
What he spoke with Cao Pi of was solely:
*"Governance values stillness and clarity, and the people will settle themselves."*
Expanding upon this principle,
Cao Pi grasped the method,
and as Chancellor of the State of Qi for nine years,
he brought about great harmony.

Master Li said:
*"Non-action and non-desire,
non-interference and love of stillness—
all are uprightness.
To govern with this,
the seas will be tranquil and the rivers clear;
to practice the Dao with this,
the Way will flourish and the times will prosper;
to cultivate oneself with this,
one’s *qi* will solidify and the spirit will condense.
When one is upright, ten thousand are upright;
when one heart is upright, ten thousand transformations are upright;
when one body is upright, ten thousand affairs are upright.
The meaning of uprightness is vast indeed!"*

**Chapter Fifty-Eight**
When governance is obscure and unadorned,
its people are pure and unspoiled.
When governance is scrutinizing and exacting,
its people grow deficient.

Fortune and misfortune lean upon each other,
misfortune and fortune lie hidden within each other—
who can know their limits?
What is upright may become strange,
what is strange may become upright;
what is good may become perverse,
what is perverse may become good.
The people’s confusion has long been thus.

Master Lin said:
*"Obscure and unadorned"* means not contriving cleverness.
*"Scrutinizing and exacting"* means excessive fussing.
*"Pure and unspoiled"* means self-contentment.
*"Deficient"* means insufficiency.
This also conveys the idea:
where there is intent, there is harm;
where there is no intent, governance is self-regulating.

Misfortune and fortune are not constant;
they lean upon and conceal each other—
who can know their ultimate end?
Uprightness is fixed,
but what is without uprightness?
It speaks of their endless leaning and concealment,
impossible to define.

In all under heaven,
what is strange may become upright,
what is upright may become strange,
what is good may become perverse,
what is perverse may become good—
benefit and harm, right and wrong—
all follow this pattern.
This too is the meaning of misfortune and fortune leaning upon each other.
The world’s people are confused and do not know it,
merely dividing strange from upright,
perverse from good—
their confusion is not of one day’s making.

Master Li said:
The previous chapter spoke of non-action and non-interference,
letting the people transform themselves—
a governance of broad tolerance.
Thus it follows with *"governance is obscure and unadorned,"*
meaning:
when the ruler is tolerant and expansive, the people are sincere and genuine;
when the ruler is overly active, the people grow dull and violent.
*"Obscure and unadorned"* is tolerance,
*"scrutinizing and exacting"* is meticulousness—
tolerance wins the people,
rigid law without flexibility harms them.
Misfortune and fortune lean upon each other,
uprightness and strangeness alternate,
good and perverse oppose each other—
this is the natural order.
How can one not take heed?

Cultivating fortune is not as good as avoiding misfortune,
pursuing uprightness is not as effective as avoiding perversity.
Though uprightness is good,
if one arrogantly claims extraordinary virtue,
it becomes perverse.
When uprightness is forced to be upright,
it ceases to be upright.
When goodness is forced to be good,
it ceases to be good.

Master Lü said:
The ancients aligned with Heaven’s movements,
their governance broad and natural,
letting things unfold without interference—
ever unadorned and obscure,
thus their customs were pure and unspoiled.
Those who cultivated the True Way
embraced the boundless spirit,
vast and tranquil,
forgetting sight and sound,
without distinction—
their breathing deep and pure,
and the Dao of transcendence was achieved.
Thus it is said:
*"When governance is obscure and unadorned,
its people are pure and unspoiled."*

Later rulers, with their rigid and hasty governance,
used laws to bind the people,
their scrutiny penetrating like a fishing net—
yet they still deemed it insufficient.
The people’s loss of their nature
was never more severe.
Thus they constantly stumbled into prohibitions,
their refinement and decay scattering,
and customs daily declined.

Those of shallow learning or just beginning the True Way,
not yet attaining Dao’s subtlety,
their *qi* and spirit not yet condensed,
their minds entangled in affairs,
obsessed with minute scrutiny,
praising cleverness and deceit—
if they govern themselves thus,
they gasp and strain,
their true essence departs,
and this is not the Way of nurturing life.
Thus it is said:
*"When governance is scrutinizing and exacting,
its people grow deficient."*

Moreover, the origins of chaos and order,
the sources of misfortune and fortune—
these have existed since antiquity,
arising from human actions.
When misfortune hides within fortune,
if fortune reaches its peak
and one cannot practice humility and fear,
but instead indulges in arrogance and excess,
there has never been one who did not invite misfortune.

When fortune lies hidden within misfortune,
if one, amid calamity and hardship,
suddenly abandons past errors
and inwardly reflects,
then what was once hidden becomes fortune.

The Dao of Heaven and Earth has periods of rest and activity,
the revolutions of sun and moon have phases of waning and waxing—
this is the pattern of leaning and concealment,
misfortune and fortune arising in sequence,
their limits unknown.

Those who hold the world
should not seek to govern it with clarity and activity,
but instead let it unfold naturally,
neither coveting wealth nor rejoicing in longevity,
neither honoring prominence nor shaming poverty.
Thus misfortune and fortune lean upon each other—
what concern are they to me?

Those who cultivate the True Way
do not seek fortune first,
nor invite misfortune.
They forget self and other—
how could misfortune and fortune’s leaning burden them?

Thus it is said:
*"Fortune and misfortune lean upon each other,
misfortune and fortune lie hidden within each other—
who can know their limits?"*
The movements of yin and yang govern life and death,
stasis and motion determine auspiciousness and calamity,
uprightness and perversity, goodness and perversity—
who can define them?

Uprightness is the orthodox path,
strangeness is a deviant route,
goodness is innate nature,
perversity is an aberrant kind.
Rooted in a single mind,
they branch into four—
not the harmony of a single *qi*.

Those who claim to uphold uprightness
must be sages with deliberate intent,
yet cunning and deceit
only harm what is upright.
To forcefully assert uprightness,
omens and portents arise—
they harm what is good.

Goodness and perversity, strangeness and uprightness,
alternate in their influence,
human nature is not singular,
lost between perversity and uprightness—
their confusion has endured for ages.

Take those of mediocre or low station who have heard the Dao:
they may suddenly conceive a spark of goodness,
yet lack the resolve to stand alone.
Confused by appearances,
in the blink of an eye,
errant thoughts arise—
and uprightness becomes strangeness,
goodness and strangeness become perversity.
As Zhuangzi and the Sage said:
*"The divine and strange transform into rot and decay."*

The wisdom of the Sage is hard to fathom,
even spirits and gods cannot discern it—
how much more so for the common flow?

「Thus, people have long been mired in delusion and folly—
it is not only a recent affliction.
Therefore it is said:
*When there is neither uprightness nor perversity,*
*uprightness becomes strangeness,*
*goodness becomes perversity.*
The people’s confusion,
its duration has indeed been long.

Hence, the Sage is square yet does not sever,
clean yet does not wound,
direct yet does not indulge,
bright yet does not dazzle.

**He Xian** says:
*Severing is harming,*
*wounding is injuring.*
Square yet not severed—
easy to harm.
Clean yet not wounded—
easy to injure.
I use square and clean,
leading by my own virtue,
to let transformation unfold naturally—
I would never do harm to others or injure them.

*Indulging is excess,*
*dazzling is ostentation.*
Direct yet not indulgent—
easy to flaunt.
Bright yet not dazzling—
easy to blind.
I use direct and bright,
to show the Dao to the people,
to let transformation unfold naturally—
I would never indulge in self-aggrandizement or self-display.

*Moderate yet not extreme*—
an ancient complete phrase,
as seen in the *Annotations of the Plenitude of Rites* (*Liji* 注).
Those who alter *wounding* to *filth* are incorrect.
In *Zhuangzi*, *clean* and *wound* share similar meanings—
*refined and polished*.

**Dong Shi** says:
*Square in conduct yet round in virtue,*
*so there is no confusion of severing or wounding.*
Clean—
to contain without harm.
Indulging—
to spread without restraint.
The great directness,
though appearing bent, does not indulge,
bright yet not dazzling—
restoring its clarity.
These four are the essence of governance.

The Sage alone maintains tranquility and non-action,
using square, clean, direct, and bright principles within—
orderly yet imperceptible to people.
He lets all under heaven dwell in their natural states,
unentangled by one-sided extremes—
thus avoiding severing, wounding, indulging, and dazzling.
Then, how can misfortune or blessing arise?

**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing People and Serving Heaven, Nothing Exceeds Frugality**

**Lü Shi** says:
The Sage’s governance,
with non-action and non-interference,
saves resources and restrains expenditure—
then the granaries are full,
the people prosper, and customs flourish.
Then, preserving vitality and cherishing spirit,
unifying the heart and purifying the self,
to manifestly honor the sacrifice to the Supreme Sovereign—
both people and gods are in harmony.

Moreover, the Sage’s **cleverness and wisdom**,
his **movement and stillness**, his **thought and contemplation**—
these are the inner fulfillments of his mind.
His **bending and stretching**, his **bowing and rising**,
his **appearance, voice, and color**—
these are the outer fulfillments of his body.
The two must harmonize,
naturally aligned—
the key lies in each attaining its proper measure.
This is the meaning of **frugality**.

Cultivating the inner
is the way to govern people—
governing oneself to govern others.
Cherishing the **primordial essence** (*yuan* 元)
is the way to serve Heaven—
serving one’s own Heaven.

Heaven is the **cerebral palace** (*nao gong* 脑宫),
pure Yang radiant and vast,
dwelling in the **Upper Nine** (*Shang Jiu* 上九),
above which there is no Yin.
From the **Jade Capital Gate** (*Yujing Guan* 玉京关) upward,
all is Heaven.

Frugality is **preservation and cherishing**.
Cherishing vision nourishes the spirit,
cherishing hearing nourishes the **void** (*xu* 虚),
cherishing speech nourishes the **qi**,
cherishing rest nourishes **harmony** (*he* 和),
cherishing the brain nourishes the blood—
thus it is said:
*Governing people and serving Heaven,*
*nothing exceeds frugality.*

**He Xian** says:
The ruler stands at the juncture of Heaven and humanity.
Whatever is used to serve Heaven above,
and govern people below,
often seeks from without—
yet does not seek within the self.
The **Grand Historian** (*Sima Qian* 司马迁) placed Dao first among the Six Schools,
taking its **singular focus** (*shen* 神) as the **Great Dao** (*Dadao* 大道),
saying *"movement aligns with the formless"*—
this is harmony with Heaven.
Saying *"sufficiently nourishing all things"*—
this also nourishes the people.
Again, he said:
*The essence of what humans bear is spirit,*
*what they rely upon is form.*
If **vitality** (*jing* 精) is overused, it is exhausted;
if **spirit** (*shen* 神) is overused, it is fatigued.
When spirit departs, death ensues—
thus the Sage treasures it.

Treasure—
this is the meaning of **frugality**.
Frugality is the utmost **parsimony**.
The Sage guards the inner yet does not guard the outer.
When he speaks of **restraint** (*jie* 节),
**cherishing** (*ai* 爱),
**preservation** (*shou* 守)—
all are frugality’s intent.

Not frugal with the mouth leads to excessive speech and depleted **qi**.
The five flavors, if indulged, impair vitality;
not frugal with ears and eyes leads to the five sounds confusing the ears,
the five colors confusing the eyes—
as it says,
*"To indulge one’s desires*
*fatigues the spirit."*
Thus, **frugality in vitality, qi, and spirit**—
this, on the Dao’s path,
can be **guest of the Nine Purity** (*Jiu Qing* 九清),
and below,
can bless all living beings.

**Wu Shi** says:
Sound—
the essential **guardian of form** (*liu xing xi qi* 留形惜气),
the **vital screen** (*yao wei* 要卫).

**Li Shi** says:
Governing people and serving Heaven,
nothing exceeds **beginning with frugality**.
Speaking of the state,
it means **reducing punishments** and **lightening taxes**.
Speaking of the self,
it means **restraining speech** and **moderating drink and food**.
Speaking of the heart,
it means **limiting thought** and **cutting off vision and hearing**,
preserving the heart and nurturing nature—
thus one can serve Heaven.

Frugality alone is called **early restoration** (*zao fu* 早复).
Early restoration is **heavily accumulating virtue** (*zhong ji de* 重积德).
Heavily accumulating virtue—
nothing cannot be overcome.
Nothing cannot be overcome—
its limits are unknown.
Its limits unknown—
one can have a state.

**Lü Shi** says:
Moreover, **frugality**—
cherishing and nurturing the spirit,
diligently practicing moderation with constancy—
like nature, unchanging;
like virtue, unshifting.
Restraining expenditure and storing resources,
self-sufficient in frugality—
while wisdom and tranquility mutually nourish,
desires do not stray outward.
Nature restores itself from within—
as when one cherishes form,
preserves spirit,
honors qi,
and stabilizes the root.
Spirit, brain, and blood—
not wasted or scattered.
Early to restore the original and return to the essence—
thus it is said:
**Frugality alone is early restoration.**

Cultivating the inner—
early frugality leads to restoration,
then **qi softens** and **harmonizes**,
all spirits find ease,
restoring one’s original nature—
not swayed by external things.
Deep and distant—
thus it is said: **early restoration.**

Called **heavily accumulating virtue**—
yet **heavy accumulation** means
**overcoming oneself to return to propriety** (*ke ji fu li* 克己复礼),
**cultivating the Dao with benevolence** (*xiu dao yi ren* 修道以仁).
Never indulging in **ostentation or commercialization** (*xuan yu* 眩鬻),
Heaven and humanity trust and obey—
no thing dares defy.
Thus, the four quarters **reverently emulate**,
nothing resists or conquers—
hence the saying:
*Heavily accumulating virtue,*
*its limits are unknown.*」

「Thus it is said: **Heavily accumulating virtue**, then nothing fails to be overcome.
And when nothing fails to be overcome,
the myriad things return to their transformations,
virtue and Dao are boundless—
where shall it not prevail?
Those who refine within,
great virtue abides with ease,
for they do not contend—
what then can they not overcome?
Reaching the One without resistance,
true constancy never alters.
Attuning to the Ten Thousand Ages yet never aging—
who can fathom its limits?
Thus it is said: **Heavily accumulating virtue**, then its limits are unknown.

When its limits are beyond knowing,
one’s body follows yet precedes itself;
the world joyfully extols it without wearying.
Enjoying the Ren of Yao,
delighting in the transformations of Yao,
his realm is preserved with ample surplus.

Those who refine within,
embody the boundless Dao,
and nurture virtue without end—
a realm that can be secured
is like a body that can endure.
Thus it is said: **Its limits are unknown**, yet one can have a realm.

○ Master He says:
**Heavily accumulating virtue**—
then gathered water becomes the sea,
gathered qi becomes the spirit.
Nothing fails to be overcome—
then it responds to all things in transformation,
adapting to every circumstance without fail.
When its limits are beyond knowing,
it aligns with the Great Dao,
mysterious and profound—
if rulers truly follow this Way,
they can secure their realm and endure in lasting peace.

○ Master Lin says:
This chapter speaks of **early restoration**—
when one is frugal, it returns to the root,
reverting to the origin and restoring the essence.
When virtue reaches this point,
it grows ever more abundant and flourishing.
**Heavily accumulating** means ever-increasing virtue.
The foundation of a lasting realm—
this is the Way of deep roots and firm bases,
of enduring life and long vision.

○ Master Lü says:
At first, one cultivates nature to return to virtue,
now one accumulates virtue to enter the Dao.
As the foundation of a realm,
it can nourish the people abundantly,
bestow blessings upon the land and its altars,
and span the eternal ages.
Comparing it to the body—
the foundation of a realm is qi,
and form is the basis that receives qi.
Qi is the root of form,
born from spirit and consciousness,
while form arises from qi.
Thus, Fu Xi attained it to inherit the **Qi Mother**,
for spirit is the child of qi,
while qi is the mother of spirit.

Form cannot exist without qi—
it has no foundation.
Qi cannot govern form—
then what can be its master?
When qi disperses, the body decays;
when qi remains, the body endures long.
Thus it is said: **The foundation of a realm**, can endure long.
The ruler who accumulates virtue,
governs humanity and serves Heaven,
nurtures the realm and cares for the people—
plants his roots in **non-action**,
firmly secures his base in **clarity and tranquility**,
and the altars of soil and grain stretch far.
Thus it is called the **Way of enduring life**.
Ever ruling with constant illumination,
thus it is called the **Way of long vision**.
One’s own root is the brain,
one’s own base is the navel.
Deep roots draw upon the **Original Qi** to nourish the brain—
the **immortal’s saying** goes:
*To attain non-aging, return essence to nourish the brain.*
Then, sealing the pivotal mechanisms,
closing the gates of desire,
hiding the **Original Essence** in the **obscure palace**,
and forming the **fetal breath** in the **Cinnabar Court**—
above red, below black,
left blue, right white,
within the yellow radiance of the center,
lies the **Yellow Court’s treasure**,
right at the navel—
this is called **firmly securing the base**.
Now, to cultivate **enduring life**,
first one must **secure the base**,
breathing in harmony with **Great Unity**,
returning the spirit and taming the qi,
with **fetal breath** continuous and abiding in the navel,
**enduring life** becomes as constant as Heaven and Earth,
and **long vision** shines like the sun and moon.

The **immortal’s saying** declares:
*To attain enduring life, one must first achieve long vision.*
**Long vision** is **inner vision**.

○ Master Lin says:
This chapter uses governing a realm to illustrate **nourishing life**.
If one can be frugal in nourishing life,
then one can deepen the roots,
firm the base,
attain enduring life,
and achieve long vision.

○ Master Su says:
Using **frugality** to govern the people,
one can secure a realm.
Using **frugality** to serve Heaven,
one plants deep roots and secures the base.
The ancient sages
preserved their **nature and life’s constancy**,
not wasting the inner through external excess—
then their roots are deep, their bases firm,
and nothing can uproot them.
Though **enduring life** and **long vision** may follow,
**frugality** alone is supreme in governing people and serving Heaven.

**Chapter Sixty: Governing a Great Realm, Like Cooking a Small Fresh Fish.**

○ Master Lü says:
Governing a great realm—
one must not **harass** it, for harassment brings disorder.
Cooking a small fresh fish—
one must not **disturb** it, for disturbance makes it rot.
Thus, the adept ruler
cooks a fish no larger than a palm,
adjusting the **water and fire**,
letting it cook itself—
then the fish remains whole.
If one disturbs it, the fish is damaged,
and it spoils in the pot.

The adept governor
harmonizes his **policies and teachings**,
letting the people find their own way—
then the people are naturally at ease.
If one disturbs them, the people are harmed,
and they scatter from the realm.
Thus, the **Way of governance values clarity and tranquility**,
the realm depends on the people,
the body depends on qi.
Loving the people and governing the realm—
then the realm prospers.
Loving qi and governing the body—
then the body endures long.
Hence this illustration is set forth.

The method of **loving the people and conserving qi**
is like cooking a small fresh fish—
do not stir it,
for agitation wastes and ruins it.

○ Master Li says:
Governing with **rectitude**,
one’s policies are **profound and subtle**.
Governing people and serving Heaven—
all are the **meaning of governance**.
A small fresh fish—
a tiny fish.
Using it as an analogy,
if one stirs it, it disintegrates—
speaking of governing the world,
if one disturbs it, chaos ensues.

○ Master Lin says:
Cooking a small fresh fish—
if one stirs it, it breaks apart.
Governing a realm—
if one disturbs it, disorder arises.
**Clarity and tranquility, non-action,**
peace and stillness without disturbance—
this is the **Way of governance**.

---
**Governing the world with the Dao, the spirits lose their power.**

○ Master Lü says:
The sage is **divinely illuminated**,
the master of all things.
Though compelled to govern the world,
he employs the **Way of non-action** to rule it.
Thus the winds and rains come in due measure,
floods and droughts do not arise.
Human hearts are **purified and harmonized**,
and the spirits and gods all submit to **illuminated virtue**.
The spirits, content in their **hidden realms**,
dare not emit their **mysterious sounds**,
nor display their **divine transformations**.
If one governs the world within one’s own body
with the Dao,
then **serenity and simplicity** mutually nourish,
the **divine abode** is **calm and settled**,
inner **Heavenly Light** radiates,
**evil spirits** are **extinguished**,
and how dare the **malevolent ghosts** show their **divine transformations**?

○ **Master Wu says:**
"Governing" is the same as "descending."
"Ghosts" refer to the **qi of Heaven and Earth**—**divine and numinous** forces, **portents and omens**.

Humankind’s **qi** flows as one with the **qi of Heaven and Earth**.
The sovereign who follows the **Dao** descends upon the world with **serenity and simplicity**,
does not disturb or harm the people,
so the people’s **qi** becomes **purified and harmonized**,
filling the **Heavenly and Earthly realms**,
mutually resonating in **correspondence and response**,
and the **qi of Heaven and Earth** does not dare to act in **contrariety or perversity**,
so its **ghostly portents** do not become **malevolent omens** to bring calamity.

○ **Master He says:**
To govern the world with the **Dao** is to **divinely illuminate** the people and bring them **serenity**.
As *Zhuangzi* says, the sage descends upon the world only when compelled,
and nothing surpasses **non-action**.
**Non-action** means the people find **tranquility in their natural lives**,
acting without interference, yet ever **spontaneously**,
and nothing can harm them.

○ **Riverbank Master** [河上公] says:
When one holds office by **Dao and virtue** and governs the world,
the **ghosts** dare not display their **spiritual essence** to offend humanity.
It is not that their **spiritual essence** is absent—
rather, they cannot harm those who live in **natural harmony**.
Nor is it that they are unable to harm—
the sage also does not harm them.
**Master Lü says:**
It is not that the **ghosts** lack **divine transformations** and **mysterious sounds**,
but rather that the sage maintains his **proper station**,
and the **ghosts** ought to **reverently praise** the **grand beauty of Heaven and Earth**,
**assisting and harmonizing** with **illuminated virtue**,
fittingly bestowing blessings,
and not merely refraining from **malevolent omens** and **mysterious transformations**
to harm the people.

Moreover, the **Daoist sage** does not allow the **ghosts** to display their **divine transformations**,
for they cannot harm those who abide in **natural harmony**.
Thus it is said: *"It is not that the ghosts lack spiritual essence—
rather, they cannot harm those who live in natural harmony."*
When the **spiritual essence** is **settled in rectitude**,
it does not harm the people,
for it submits to the **illuminated virtue** of the sage,
retiring into **hidden realms** and not daring to reveal its **portents and omens**.

The sage pities even a single individual who has lost his **proper place**,
never failing to consider the means to **rescue and sustain** him.
Just as a father nurtures his child,
though he wraps and swaddles him,
his care is ever **vigilant and tender**—
how could he harm him?
This is like the **Daoist sage** abiding in **natural harmony**,
where not only the **ghosts** dare not offend,
but the sage himself does not harm them either.
The sage, who **honors the Dao** and **values virtue**,
would never harm those who follow the **Dao**!

Thus it is said: *"It is not that the spiritual essence cannot harm—
rather, the sage does not harm them."*

○ **Master Wu says:**
The reason the **ghosts** do not become **portents and omens** is not that they are incapable—
though they can become **portents and omens**, they do not act in **malevolence** to harm humanity.
Again, the **ghosts'** portents and omens** do not harm humanity not because they are inherently so,
but because the sage can **purify and harmonize** the people’s **qi** without harming the **qi of Heaven and Earth**,
so the **qi of Heaven and Earth** also remains **purified and harmonized** and does not harm humanity.
The terms **"ghosts"** and **"spiritual essence"** both refer to the **qi of Heaven and Earth**,
two names yet one reality.

○ **Riverbank Master** [河上公] says:
The **ghosts** are not without **spiritual essence**—
they simply cannot harm those who live in **natural harmony**.
When both sides do not harm each other,
**virtue and power** mutually return to their source.

○ **Master Lü says:**
Humans are governed by the **yang**, the **ghosts** by the **yin**.
Humans **preserve their natural lives**,
while the **ghosts** **fulfill their divine spirits**.
Both sides, in **reciprocal delight**, do not harm one another,
leading to **Heaven’s clarity and Earth’s peace**,
**harmony between yin and yang**,
**abundant harvests each year**,
**no creatures maimed or lost**,
**no flaws in the state**,
**no plagues among the people**,
**no malevolent omens from the ghosts**—
thus **virtue and power** mutually return to their source.

○ **Master Lin** [林氏] says:
**Hidden realms** manifest as **yin and yang**,
while **illuminated governance** is the **sage’s proper station**.
These two aspects inherently do not harm each other,
so their **virtue and power** mutually return.
This means **Heaven and Earth** follow their **natural Dao**,
and the sage also follows the **natural Dao**,
each preserving their own **virtue and power** without encroachment,
hence the saying: *"They mutually return."*

**Not harming** means **not encroaching**.
This passage first presents a general statement,
then elaborates on the **Way of the Three Powers**—
all of it is about **non-action**.
To govern the world with the **Dao** is to encompass the **Three Powers** [Heaven, Earth, humanity].
All things beneath the **Great Void** [太虚]
are governed by the **Dao**:
**Heaven** fulfills its role of **covering and nurturing**,
**Earth** fulfills its role of **bearing and sustaining**,
and the sage fulfills his role of **teaching and guiding**.
When each fulfills its own role without encroaching,
all attain their **Dao**.

○ **Riverbank Master** [河上公] says:
The **ghosts** and the **sage** both do not harm each other.
When neither harms the other,
humans are governed by the **yang**,
while the **ghosts** are governed by the **yin**,
humans **preserve their natural lives**,
and the **ghosts** **fulfill their divine spirits**—
thus **virtue and power** mutually return.

○ **Master He** [何氏] says:
The ancient people dwelled in the **indistinct void** [混茫],
and with the world they **dissolved in tranquility**.
At that time,
**yin and yang** knew **stillness**,
**ghosts and gods** did not disturb,
the **Four Seasons** followed their **proper rhythms**,
and all things were **unharmed**.
Though creatures had **awareness**,
they **did not apply it**—
this was called **"Absolute Unity"**,
where **non-action** and **spontaneity** prevail eternally.
This is the case.

**Chapter 61:**
*"Great states are the lower streams [of the world],
the **confluence of all things**,
the **yin of the world**.*
*The **yin** always overcomes the **yang** by **stillness**,
and **stillness** is the **yin**’s way.*

○ **Master Lin** [林氏] says:
Borrowing the **principle of great states and small states**,
he illustrates that the **Daoist sage** ought to **be humble and still**,
not teaching people to **submit themselves** to gain victory.
Since the **Three Dynasties** onward,
there have been those who **seize states**,
so he uses their observations as an analogy.

*"Lower streams"* means to **place oneself in a humble station**.
The people of great states,
if they **humble themselves**,
can **unite the world’s confluence**,
just as the **yin** overcomes the **yang** by **stillness**.
To **humble oneself** is to **abide in stillness** as the **Dao**,
hence the saying: *"Stillness is the yin’s way."*

○ **Master Lü** [吕氏] says:
The reason the **seas and rivers** can be the **"sovereigns of all valleys"** [百谷]
is that they **excel in humility**.
All streams **converge at the river’s source** [朝宗],
just as great states, through **humility and inclusivity**,
can **unite all people** without exception.
The **Classics** say:
*"When Heaven and Earth’s **qi** converge, all things are born.
When the **Dao of humanity** converges, **achievements and merit** are fulfilled."*
This is what is meant by *"confluence."*

The establishment of **one body** is the **mirror of a state**.
To **forget one’s body** is to **order all limbs**,
To **empty one’s heart** is to **return to harmony with the **qi****.
The **emptiness and nothingness** are where **sages dwell**,
Which can be called a **great state**.

Because it **does not contend**,
The **world cannot contend with it**.
Even the **essence of all things**,
When **converged and united**,
Is like the **many waters rushing to the lowlands**.
Hence the saying: *"Great states are the lowlands."*

The **confluence of the world**,
The **yin of the world**,
Does not initially **hold the heart to victory**,
Only through **stillness** does it always prevail.
To **prevail through stillness** is to **abide in humility**,
Hence the **world’s confluence** returns to it.

**Yin is still, yang is dynamic**,
Softness is still, hardness is active.
Hardness is **overcome by softness**,
Activity is **subdued by stillness**.
The **Classics** say:
*"Know the **heroic**,
Guard the **receptive**,
And you will be the **valley of the world**."*
This is indeed the **virtue of humility and abasement**,
Which ensures **no undertaking fails**—
**Victory is inherent in oneself**.

**Heaven’s One** generates **water**,
In humans, this is **precision**.
**Earth’s Two** generates **fire**,
In humans, this is **divine spirit**.
**Divine spirit** is the **yin within the yang**,
Hence it is called **receptive**,
Also the **yin of the world**.
To **know the heroic and guard the receptive**,
To **focus the **qi** and cultivate softness**,
To **refine yang with yin**,
Is the **mysterious and wondrous application**,
Hence **yin always prevails through stillness**.

**Stillness** attracts **all movements**,
**Humility** draws **all people**—
This is the **key to cultivating the **True Dao****.
Hence, **great states humble themselves to small states**,
And **gain the small states**.
**Small states humble themselves to great states**,
And **gain the great states**.
Sometimes **humility leads to gain**,
Sometimes **humility brings gain**.

**Master Lin** says:
To **gain through greatness** is called *"gain"* (以取),
To **gain through smallness** is called *"while taking"* (而取).
These two phrases are **most profound**.

**Master Lü** says:
To **serve small states with greatness**,
Only **benevolence** can achieve this.
To **serve great states with smallness**,
Only **wisdom** can achieve this.
Those who **serve small states with greatness** are **rejoicing in Heaven’s Dao**,
Those who **serve great states with smallness** are **fearing Heaven’s Dao**.
The **rejoicing in Heaven’s Dao** know **Heaven’s command**,
The **fearing Heaven’s Dao** **preserve themselves**.

**Master Wu** says:
**Great states**, originally **above small states**,
Do not **rely on their exalted status** but **humble themselves below small states**,
Thus **attracting the small states’ joyful submission**.
**Small states**, naturally **below great states**,
**Gladly abide in humility** and **bow to the great states**,
Thus **earning the great states’ favor**.
*"Humility leads to gain"* means **great states** can **humble themselves to gain small states’ joyful submission**,
*"Humility brings gain"* means **small states** can **humble themselves to earn great states’ favor**.

**Master He** says:
**Great states humble themselves to small states**,
Like **Tang serving Ge**,
Or **King Wen serving the Kun Yi**.
**Small states humble themselves to great states**,
Like **King Tai serving the Xi Yu**,
Or **King Gu of Yue serving Wu**—
Such examples.

**Master Li** says:
**Superiors humble themselves to inferiors**,
**Inferiors humble themselves to superiors**,
**Superiors yield to inferiors, inferiors comply with superiors**—
Thus **virtue and Way return to their confluence**.
**Cultivating oneself** with this principle:
The **heart grows more humble**, the **Way grows more exalted**,
The **body grows more retiring**, the **virtue grows more refined**.
**Great states** only **seek to embrace and nurture all people**,
**Small states** only **seek to be included in service**.
If both **fulfill their desires**,
Then **greatness is fitting to abide in humility**.

**Master Lin** says:
The **intent of great states** is only **to embrace and nurture all people**,
The **intent of small states** is only **to carve and inscribe themselves** in seeking service.
Both must **abide in humility**—
Only through **humility** can each **fulfill their desires**,
Thus the **greatest understanding of the Way** must **favor humility and abasement**.

**Master Wu** says:
When **great states humble themselves to small states**,
It is only **to embrace and nurture the small states**.
When **small states humble themselves to great states**,
It is only **to seek inclusion in service**.
If both **abide in humility**,
Then **great and small each attain their desires**,
Yet the **small ones** are naturally **beneath others**,
And **do not fear their inability to humble themselves**,
While the **great ones**, not naturally **beneath others**,
**May fear their inability**—
Hence it is **specifically emphasized** that the **great ones should abide in humility**.

**Master Lü** says:
When **great states humble themselves to small states**,
It is only **to annex and embrace the small states’ people**,
Making them **their rulers and leaders**.
When **small states humble themselves to great states**,
It is only **to offer proper rites** and **reverently serve the great states**,
Seeking **aid and support**.
Yet **great and small** each **fulfill their proper roles**,
**Mutually holding firm** without **encroaching or provoking**,
**Content in their dwellings**,
**Rejoicing in their customs**,
And **small states naturally submit in softness**—
This is the **natural order**.

**Great states** practice **humility and abasement**,
Hence they **should bend and yield** to **preserve completeness**,
Making **great and small adaptable**,
Thus **attracting the world’s confluence**.

**Master He** says:
This chapter **begins with "Great states are the lowlands"**,
And **ends with "Greatness is fitting to abide in humility"**,
Though **great and small states are discussed together**,
The **primary focus is always on the great states**.
The **small ones** easily **abide in humility**,
This **requires no instruction**,
The **great ones**, prone to **excess and pride**,
Find **humility difficult**—
Even with instruction, they **may not comply**.
Hence it is **repeatedly emphasized**,
In alignment with the **same Way as the *I Ching*** (*易*).

**Chapter Sixty-Two**
The **Dao** is the **mysterious core of all things**.

The **virtuous** hold **Dao** as their treasure,
While the **unvirtuous** rely upon it for **safeguard**.

**Master He** says:
The **Dao** molds and refines all things,
Polishes the formless,
Silent and unmoving—
The **Great Dao** is **mysterious and obscure**,
Deep, vast, and boundless,
Unattainable from without,
Unfathomable within—
This is what is called the **mysterious core of all things**.
Like the **inner sanctum of a hall**,
Not glimpsed in haste,
As *Zhuangzi* says, the **Dao** is the **shared source of all things**,
Hence this chapter first speaks of **treasure**, then of **nobility**.

The **Dao** does not distance itself from people—
People distance themselves from the **Dao**.
Though there is a distinction between **virtuous** and **unvirtuous**,
Even the **unvirtuous** rely upon it in hidden ways for **security**.

**Master Wu** says:
The **mysterious core of all things** refers to what is **most honored**—
*"Olymp"* (奥) is the **west-south corner of a hall**, where the **noble** reside,
Thus *"Olymp"* signifies **nobility**.
The **nobility of the Dao** is like this.
**Treasure** is what the **virtuous** value—
When the **virtuous** turn toward the **Dao** and cultivate it,
They gain **esteem from others**,
Hence it is said: *"The treasure of the virtuous."*
When the **unvirtuous** turn toward the **Dao** and repent,
They may yet **preserve themselves**,
Hence it is said: *"The safeguard of the unvirtuous."*
**Graceful speech** can be **traded in the market**,
**Noble conduct** can **elevate others**.
Why should the **unvirtuous** be **cast aside**?
Thus, when establishing the **Son of Heaven** and appointing the **Three Ministers**,
Even with **jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** offered first,
It is **not as valuable** as **sitting and advancing this Dao**.

**Master Li** says:
**Graceful speech** can be **traded in the market**—
Sufficient to **please the multitude**,
**Noble conduct** can **elevate others**—
Sufficient to **rise above the crowd**.
If a person is **unvirtuous**, why **abandon them**?
To establish the **Son of Heaven** and appoint the **Three Ministers** is to **make them rulers and teachers**,
To **cultivate the people below**,
So that the **unvirtuous** follow their **transformations**.
**Jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** are **not truly noble**—
Not as noble as **sitting and advancing this Dao**,
Cultivating oneself to **settle the people**,
Leading with **respect and humility** so they **do not contend**,
Displaying **virtue and righteousness** so they **upright their conduct**,
Demonstrating **approval and disapproval** so they **know prohibitions**—
Thus the **Sage** always **rescues people with virtue**,
And **never abandons anyone**.

**Master Chai** says:
The **Dao’s flavor** is **beneficial**—
Like **treasure brought to market**,
Hence *"graceful speech can be traded in the market."*
**Virtue’s weight** is **irresistible**,
Hence *"noble conduct can elevate others."*
If a person is **unvirtuous**, why **abandon them**?
Teach them to **transform**—
How dare one **abandon them**?
Thus, establishing the **Son of Heaven** and appointing the **Three Ministers** is to **assist in advancing this Dao**.

**Master Wu** says:
The **virtuous** gain **esteem from others** through the **Dao**—
Their **praiseworthy words** are **lovable**, like **fine goods sold in the market**,
Their **exalted deeds** are **worthy of veneration**, rising above others.
The **unvirtuous** preserve themselves through the **Dao**—
Fearful of **punishment**, few in **guilt**, their **bodies remain whole and secure**,
Thus even the **unvirtuous**—
How could the **Dao** ever **abandon them**?
**Jewel-encircled jade**—a **jewel held in both hands**—
**Four-horse chariots**—a **single team of horses**,
**Jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** are **the height of nobility**,
Yet they are **not truly noble**.
Not as noble as **advancing this Dao**—
**Jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** are **not as noble as this Dao**,
Hence all things **hold it in highest esteem** as their **mysterious core**.

**Master He** says:
Not to **glory in jade, gems, or chariots**,
But to **hold advancing this Dao as noble**.
Why did the **ancients** hold this **Dao** in such **nobility**?
Was it not because **seeking it brings attainment**,
And **guilt is pardoned**?
Thus it is **noble for all under Heaven**.

**Master Lin** says:
Moreover, why did the **ancients** hold this **Dao** in such **nobility**?
Because **seeking it brings attainment**—
The **Dao** is **within oneself**,
To **practice virtue** depends on **oneself**, not others.
To **pardon guilt**—
A single **virtuous thought** can **correct errors**,
Even the **wicked**, through **fasting, purification, and bathing**, may **offer sacrifice to the Most High**.
It is not said, *"As the *Poetry Classic* does not say?"*
The **Dao** knows **no distinction between wise and foolish**—
**Awakening brings attainment**,
This is why it is **truly noble**,
Hence it is said: *"Thus it is noble for all under Heaven."*

**Master He** says:
Without a single person **not gaining what they desire** or **gathering what they seek**,
All their **pursuits are fulfilled**.
The **Noble One** delights in **attaining the Dao** and **rests in virtue**,
The **petty person** delights in **attaining desires** but **shames unvirtue**,
Even those who are **unvirtuous** yet **turn their hearts toward the Dao**,
**Shift toward virtue and distance guilt**—
Unaware, they do so.
This is how those **who embody the Dao** gain **great use in the world**,
And it also **reveals the Dao’s efficacy**—
The more **noble**, the more **esteemed**,
Thus it is said: *"The ancients held this Dao in nobility"*—
Not of **this present age alone**, but **throughout antiquity**.
Thus it is.

**Chapter Sixty-Three**
**Act without acting**,
**Manage without managing**,
**Savor without savoring**.

**Master Lü** says:
The **Sage acts without purpose**,
Yet **trusts in things’ natural self-so**,
Thus **without acting, nothing remains undone**—
How could the **heart** ever **cease moving**?
**Manages without interference**,
Yet **follows things’ natural affairs**,
Thus **without managing, nothing remains unattended**—
How could the **body** ever **cease laboring**?
**Savors without indulgence**,
Yet **follows things’ inherent flavors**,
Thus **without savoring, nothing remains unsavored**—
How could the **mouth** ever **cease craving**?
When the **heart is unmoved**, all **wonders are visible**,
When the **body is unlabored**, **spirit is undiminished**,
When the **mouth is unindulgent**, **essence is undrained**—
The **Perfect One** **acts in cultivation and nourishment**,
Yet **does not engage in reckless deeds**,
**Attends to True Refining**,
Yet **does not involve themselves in worldly affairs**,
**Savors in virtue and morality**,
Yet **does not indulge in carrion and rank odors**,
Hence it is said:
**Act without acting**,
**Manage without managing**,
**Savor without savoring**.

**Master Lin** says:
Only when **acting without acting** can one **do all things**,
Hence *"Act without acting."*
Only when **managing without managing** can one **gather all affairs**,
Hence *"Manage without managing."*
Only when **indulging without indulging** can one **truly know flavor**,
Hence *"Savor without savoring."*

**Master Li** says:
**Act without acting**—
This **unfolds the mysterious core of all things** from the previous chapter.
**Act without acting**—
**Nothing remains undone**,
**Manage without managing**—
**All affairs succeed**,
**Savor without savoring**—
Its **flavor is profound and enduring**—
These three are the **Dao’s mysterious core**.

**Great and small, much and little,**
**Repay resentment with virtue,**
**Plan for difficulty in its ease,**
**Achieve the great through the minute.**

**The world’s difficult tasks**
**Must begin in simplicity,**
**The world’s grandest deeds**
**Must arise from the fine.**

**Master Lü says:**
When dealing with the formed,
There are great and small,
When bound to the formed,
There are much and little.
Though things are boundless in measure,
Their utility is rooted—
Respond without hoarding,
Entrust to innate constancy.
When great is needed, be great,
When small is needed, be small,
When much is needed, be much,
When little is needed, be little.
All things differ, yet all return to One.

All are governed by the **Dao**,
Repaid with **virtue**—
If no one harbors deep malice,
What cause for resentment remains?

The **Perfect Person’s** **Way** is vast,
His **primordial simplicity** minute,
Though his actions are many,
Their essence is few.
Great and small contain the **Great Void** within a square inch,
Much and little encompass all things in **One Reality**,
In harmony with all things, all things become one with me—
What is there to resent?

Thus it is said:
**Great and small, much and little,**
**Repay resentment with virtue.**

As for right and wrong, beauty and ugliness,
Resentment and anger, gratitude and **virtue**,
All arise from subtle beginnings,
Start in ease, and end in difficulty,
Begin in the fine, and culminate in the grand.
If one plans at the time of initial ease,
Then at the end, there will be no difficulty.
If one acts at the time of first simplicity,
Then afterward, it will surely be grand.

Thus, the world’s difficult tasks
Must begin in what is easy,
Desiring to act in ease
To plan for the weighty and great.
The world’s grandest deeds
Must arise from the minute,
Desiring to act in the minute
To remove it.

One’s own difficult task is **cultivating the True**,
One’s own grand task is **walking the **Way**.
Nothing is more difficult than **cultivating the True**,
Yet if one approaches it as if it were easy,
One’s resolve will be firm and unshaken—
What difficulty remains?
Nothing is greater than **walking the **Way**,
Yet if one treats it as a minor matter,
And persists without ceasing,
Accumulating the fine to reach the grand—

**Master Lin says:**
Those who can be great must also be able to be small,
Those who can be much must also be able to be little,
Those who harbor resentment must repay with **virtue**,
Those who plan for difficulty must first embrace ease,
Those who achieve the great must first attend to the minute.
From *"Savor without savoring"* onward,
All are metaphors.
Difficult tasks must begin in ease,
Great deeds must arise from the minute—
This is merely elaborating the **Dao’s** intent.

**Master Liu says:**
Some say to Confucius:
*"You advocate repaying resentment with directness,
Yet now you say to repay it with **virtue**—why?"*
Indeed, **Laozi** teaches people
To dwell in gentleness and weakness,
To align with Heaven’s course,
And to avoid contention—
Thus averting Heaven’s punishments
And warding off human calamities.
If one repays resentment with directness,
How could resentment ever cease?
At that time, Confucius spoke in provocation,
Yet nothing surpasses repaying with **virtue** as good.

Thus the **Sage** never seeks to be great,
And so can achieve the great.

**Master Lü says:**
The **Sage** does not act in what is difficult or grand,
Yet does nothing and attends to nothing,
Simple and easy, simple and knowable—
Thus can he establish foundations that endure and grow grand.
The **Sage** cherishes **virtue** and **power**,
Knows himself without revealing himself,
Loves himself without esteeming himself,
Never seeks to be great.
Within the square inch, in the realm of true nature,
There is nothing he does not forget,
Nothing he does not possess—
Serene and boundless,
Yet all beauties follow him.
Thus it is said:
*"Therefore the **Sage** never seeks to be great,
And so can achieve the great."*

**Master Li says:**
When the **Sage’s** deeds are fully realized,
He does not claim greatness himself—
Heaven does not claim to be Heaven;
What makes Heaven is things.
The **Sage** does not claim to be the **Sage**;
What makes the **Sage** is the people.
Because he does not claim to be the **Sage**,
He can become the **Sage**.

**Master Lin says:**
The **Sage** does not claim greatness yet remains humble and lowly—
Thus he achieves the great.

He who makes light promises will lack trust,
He who takes many things lightly will face many difficulties.
Thus the **Sage** still regards them as difficult,
And so in the end faces no difficulty.

**Master Lü says:**
He who makes light promises lacks sincerity,
And reckless responses will lead to deceit.
He who takes many things lightly is negligent in affairs,
And reckless action will lead to difficulty.
Even the **Sage’s** talents find difficulty in minute, easy matters,
Let alone failing to dare act lightly in all things—
Thus, in the **Way**, he is diligent and perseveres,
And in the end faces no difficulty.

Light promises lead to few fulfillments,
Many easy things lead to many difficulties—
Thus it is said that first embracing difficulty leads to attainment,
For difficulty and ease complement each other.

**Master Li says:**
Difficult tasks are easy to complete,
Easy tasks are difficult to complete—
Easy tasks must not be taken lightly,
For if they are, people will neglect them,
Thus the **Sage** still regards them as difficult.
What is gained with difficulty is lost with difficulty—
If one does not act lightly in all things,
Then in the end there will be no difficulty.

**Master Lin says:**
Those who make light promises often overcommit,
And so must fail in trust.
Those who treat matters with a careless heart
Often fail to complete them—
This is also metaphorical language.
But by adding *"the man who"* [夫],
The meaning shifts again.
Earlier, it was said *"easy"* [易],
For fear people would view it with a lighthearted attitude,
Thus turning it to say:
*"Easy" is not "light and easy"—*
The **Sage** still treats it with a difficult mindset,
And so reaches a state of no difficulty—
Let alone others.

This intent means:
When earlier it spoke of *"easy,"*
It referred to **non-action** and **non-affairs** being easy to practice,
Not that *"easy"* means acting lightly.

**Master He says:**
Empty promises bring real disaster—
He who makes light promises will lack trust indeed.
Words spoken without reproach.
Many easy things lead to many difficulties—
The **Sage**, dwelling in **non-action** and savoring **non-flavor**,
Penetrating the **Way** beyond form,
Gives rise to **being** from **non-being**,
And difficulty and ease complement each other.
Adapting to things without being bound by them,
Yet able to flexibly complete all things without omission—
Thus it is said:
*"There is nothing he does not forget,
Nothing he does not possess."*
This reveals the **Sage’s** heart—
Neither **being** nor **non-being**.

**The Complete Compilation of the *Dao De Jing* (Volume Nine, *Xu Jiang Wei Da You* Collection) – Chapter 64**

Its ease is easy to maintain,
Its unseen signs are easy to plan against.
Its fragility is easy to shatter,
Its subtlety is easy to disperse.

Act before things arise,
Set things in order before they fall into disorder.

**Master Lü says:**
The ancient rulers of the world—
When governing, they faced disorder as their counterpart,
When securing peace, they faced peril as their counterpart.
When the state was at peace, it was easy to maintain,
But when it leaned toward danger, it became difficult to defend.
Thus the *Book of Zhou* says:
*"Establish governance before disorder arises,
Preserve the realm before danger manifests."*
For like a sprout not yet strong,
Its fragility is easy to shatter,
And remorse not yet settled,
Its subtleties are easy to disperse.

Take from oneself—
In the prime of youth, when the body is at ease,
It is easy to practice self-cultivation.
The rewards are seen swiftly,
For when sickness has not yet manifested,
One’s cultivation and refinement are easy to plan and achieve.
But when desires grow excessive,
Spirit weakens and vital essence is depleted,
Once illness strikes, it flees like passing waves.
If nurturing is done properly,
Qi harmonious and spirit undisturbed,
Even minor ailments are easy to treat.

Thus it is said:
*"Its ease is easy to maintain,
Its unseen signs are easy to plan against,
Its fragility is easy to shatter,
Its subtlety is easy to disperse."*
Moreover, the person yet to fall ill
Is easy to heal,
The state yet to face danger
Is easy to strategize for.
If one prepares defenses beforehand,
Then disasters not yet formed—
How could they take root?
If one makes plans in advance,
Then troubles not yet visible—
How could they arise?

Therefore, the **Sage** does not fear many difficulties,
But fears the absence of difficulty.
For calamity and fortune are inherently intertwined—
If one attends to their latent origins,
Calamity may turn into fortune.
But if one neglects them once they manifest,
Fortune may shift into calamity—
Beyond remedy.

Thus, the **Dao** of regulating the body and harmonizing the heart
Is to preemptively guard against emotions and desires,
To balance and adapt the spirit and qi,
And prevent them from falling into disorder.

**Master Li says:**
Referring to the meaning of the previous chapter,
*"Its ease is easy to maintain"*—
When undertaking deeds, the sincere seeker of **True Dao** (*Xiu Zhen Zhi Shi*)
Rectifies the heart before thoughts arise,
And restrains emotions before they are provoked by external things.
Then the heart is easily corrected,
And emotions easily severed.
But if one governs affairs after they have fallen into disorder,
And wards off disasters after they have already sprouted—
Is that not difficult?

**Master Lin says:**
When peace prevails,
Maintaining it is easy.
But once danger arises,
It becomes difficult to hold firm.
When troubles are yet unseen,
Planning against them is clear and easy.
But once they take form,
They become hard to counter.
Fragile yet not yet strong—
Attack it, and it is easy to shatter.
But once it grows firm,
It is hard to attack.
Thus, one must act before things arise,
And govern before they fall into disorder.

A tree thick enough to embrace,
Grows from a tiny sprout.
A nine-tiered tower,
Rises from a single basket of soil.
A journey of a thousand miles,
Begins with a single step.

**Master Lü says:**
If one does not preemptively guard against troubles,
Nor block evil at its roots,
It is like planting a tree.
When it first sprouts,
One may uproot and sever it—
How easy!
But once it reaches a thickness of a hundred feet,
How can one cut it down?

Again, if one builds a tower,
Starting with a single basket of soil,
One may kick it into place—
How difficult could that be?
But once it rises to nine tiers,
Towering a hundred feet high,
How can one demolish it?

Again, if one embarks on a distant journey,
Beginning with a single step,
One may turn back at once.
But once it stretches a thousand miles,
Endless and vast,
How can one return?

Thus it is said:
*"A tree thick enough to embrace,
Grows from a tiny sprout.
A nine-tiered tower,
Rises from a single basket of soil.
A journey of a thousand miles,
Begins with a single step."*

**Master Li says:**
Small things accumulate into greatness—
Beyond remedy.
Thus the *Yijing* warns:
*"Treading on frost, expect solid ice."*
The commentary states:
*"A subject slays his ruler,
A son slays his father—
This is not the work of a single morning or evening.
Their origins lie in gradual corruption,
From failing to discern early."* (*Yi Bian Zhi Bu Zao Ye*)

**Master Lin says:**
A tree thick enough to embrace,
Its growth must begin from a sprout.
A nine-tiered tower,
Its construction must start from a single basket of soil.
A journey of a thousand miles,
Must begin with the first step.
All these examples
Speak to the **Dao**-seeker’s need to understand the critical moment (*ji*).

He who acts will fail,
He who grasps will lose.
Thus the **Sage** practices **non-action** and avoids failure,
Lets go and avoids loss.

**Master Lü says:**
If one acts out of differentiation,
One disrupts **nature’s** spontaneity.
If one clings to desires and gains,
One loses **spirit’s** essence.
Better to rest in what is at ease,
And guard what is naturally held—
Then one governs without knowing one governs,
Acts without seeing one acts.

The **Sage** perceives where things fail—
From having acted.
If one does not act, how could there be failure?
Where intentions falter—
From having grasped.
If one does not grasp, how could there be loss?

If one governs the body through action,
Then form is strained and spirit taxed,
Mind and soul grow weary.
If one clings to things,
Then one becomes fixated in one corner,
Never departing from the myriad attachments,
Far from the **Way**.

The **Sage** has never acted nor grasped—
Pure and unadulterated **True Dao** (*Zhen Zhen*).
Thus, enduring ten thousand kalpas without failure,
No form to grasp—
How could there be loss?

**Master He says:**
The **Sage**, when undertaking deeds, attends to their beginnings,
And ensures both good beginnings and endings.
He never dares to act lightly,
Nor cling to what he sees.
For he harbors the subtle and profound,
Embraces simplicity and purity,
And does not dare stir up the contentious hearts of the world.
He follows **principle** (*li*) in his actions—
What does he do?
He aligns with the times in his deeds—
What does he grasp?
Names follow their own destinies,
Affairs unfold naturally—
How could he fail or lose?

The people, when they act,
Often falter just as things are nearing completion.
If one is cautious at the end as at the beginning,
Then there will be no failed affairs.

**Master Lü says:**
Though the world strives for good deeds,
None lack a beginning,
Few achieve an end.
All grow weary from the start,
Begin with joy but end in weariness,
Near completion yet then collapse—
This is because their resolve is not steadfast,
And thus **True Dao** does not solidify.
Vital essence leaks away,
Hence it is said:
*"Qi depletion, essence leakage—
This is not one’s own form."*

The **True Person** (*Zhìrén*) acts with undivided resolve,
From beginning to end, unchanging—
All spirits align of their own accord,
Who could bring him to ruin?

**Master He says:**
Common folk who seek to act
Deem diligence as incompetence,
Those who cling to rigidity
See adaptability as unprincipled.
Thus their affairs fail when nearly complete—
This warns against failing to *palindromically* (*shènzhōng-rúshǐ*) persevere,
Lest one begin with vigor but end in few achievements.

Hence the Sage
Desires without desiring,
Does not prize hard-to-obtain wealth,
Learns without learning,
Corrects the errors of the multitude,
To aid the natural unfolding of all things,
Yet dares not act.

**Master Lü says:**
The True Person is not without desire—
He desires what others do not,
Does not trade his nature for things,
So what need has he for rare treasures?
He is not without learning—
He learns what others do not,
Does not take deception as his mind.
All that the multitude errs in,
He returns to correct—
Thus it is said:
The Sage desires without desiring,
Does not prize hard-to-obtain wealth,
Learns without learning,
Corrects the multitude’s errors,
To reach the point of neither aiding life
Nor prolonging it,
Following things in their natural course,
With no room for private interference.

The **Dao** can be a parent,
**Virtue** (*dé*) a friend—
With **Dao** and **virtue** supporting his form,
In every matter, he acts spontaneously—
How could he dare to contrive?

**Master Wu says:**
The Sage’s desire is to *not desire* as desire,
His learning is to *not learn* as learning.
Hard-to-obtain wealth—
What others desire, he does not prize—
This is to not desire what is desirable,
Hence it is said: *"Desire not-desire."*
What the multitude pursues, he does not pursue;
What the multitude dismisses with a shrug, he returns to—
This is to not learn what others learn,
Hence it is said: *"Learn not-learning."*
All these—*not desiring, not learning*—
Are because the **principle** (*lǐ*) of all things
Is to act without action, naturally.
Thus I too act without action,
In harmony with all things, as spokes unite in a wheel.

**Master He says:**
This chapter first speaks of acting before action,
Then of those who act failing at completion,
And finally of daring not to act.
So is acting correct, or not acting?
Both are correct—
Is it not said:
*"Act without action,
And nothing remains ungoverned."*

**Master Lin says:**
What the multitude does not desire, the Sage desires;
What the multitude prizes, the Sage does not prize—
This is metaphorical speech.
What the multitude does not learn, the Sage learns;
What the multitude passes by without a glance, the Sage turns back to—
*Return* (*fǔ*) is also metaphorical speech.
The Sage, thus acting in all things,
Holds a heart of *daring not to act*,
Only then can he aid the natural unfolding of all things.

**Chapter 65**
The ancients who excelled in the **Dao**
Did not enlighten the people—
They sought to make them simple.
The people are hard to govern
Because their cleverness is excessive.

**Master Lü says:**
In ancient times, those who governed well
Gathered the people with **Dao**,
Opened their innate nature to the heavens,
Rectified their hearts and sincerely their intentions,
Seeking to guide the people to simplicity,
Their **virtue** and bearing overflowing,
All day like the unknowing,
So the people followed them their whole lives
Without knowing why.
Those who govern well with **Dao**
Do not display their brilliance to dazzle the vulgar,
In harmony with the unknowing,
Embracing simplicity alone.

**Master Wu says:**
In the ancient times, they governed without action,
The people were pure and unknowing.
In later times, they governed with action,
The people became artful and deceitful—
Hence their difficulty in governance.

**Master Lin says:**
Cleverness is a burden to the **Dao**.
The Sage’s teaching of others
Always seeks to obscure their cleverness,
Lest they burden themselves—
Hence it is said:
*"Not to enlighten the people,
But to make them simple."*
The more cunning and skillful the people,
The harder they are to govern—
Thus governing with cleverness
Becomes the ruin of the state.
Not governing with cleverness
Is the state’s blessing.
Know these two principles—
This is called **Mysterious Virtue** (*Xuándé*).
**Mysterious Virtue** is profound and distant,
Opposed to things—
Only then does one reach **Great Harmony** (*Dàshùn*).

**Master Lin says:**
Governing with cleverness
Becomes the ruin of the state—
For if superiors and inferiors all rely on cunning,
Chaos ensues, and treacherous ministers and rebellious sons
Seize power and rely on strength—
What more could there be?
This is not called governing with cleverness—what is?
If one governs the self with cleverness,
The spirits grow unsettled—
How could one not steal one’s **true qi**?

**Master Lü says:**
If the cleverness of bows, crossbows, and snares increases,
Birds grow disordered above.
If the cleverness of hooks, bait, and nets increases,
Fish grow disordered in the water.
If the cleverness of deceit, poison, and sophistic arguments—
Distinctions of *precedence, slipperiness, hardness, whiteness, impurity, sameness, and difference*—increases,
The vulgar are bewildered by debate.
If superiors govern with cleverness,
Then inferiors respond in kind—
Thus superiors and inferiors become entangled in chaos,
And treacherous ministers and rebellious sons
Seize power and rely on strength—
What more could there be?
This is not called governing with cleverness—what is?
Moreover, in ancient times,
Those who ruled nations
Used knots and markings on the ground—
Their governance was subtle,
Their people pure—
Without governance, they governed themselves,
Thus opening the people’s **innate nature** (*tiān*),
Yet still not as opening the **Heaven’s nature** (*tiān*).
This is not called not governing with cleverness—what is?
If one governs the self with cleverness,
The spirits grow unsettled—
How could one not steal one’s **true qi**?

---

Born without relying on cleverness,
This is called nourishing tranquility with cleverness.

When cleverness and tranquility mutually nourish each other,
Then the myriad spirits become balanced and harmonious,
And the ten thousand *qi* all blend in unity—
Who, if not those who forget the form and embrace the Dao,
Could attain this?

Thus it is said:
To govern a nation with cleverness is to ruin it,
To govern without cleverness is to bless it.
For those who employ cleverness corrupt governance and harm the people,
While those who do not employ cleverness cultivate governance and nourish the people—
These are the models and standards by which to measure.

Having known these models yet still not using cleverness,
To bring this people to wealth and longevity,
Following Heaven’s principles,
And aligning with Heaven’s virtue—
This is called knowing these two models.

To always know these models
Is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.

The **Mysterious Virtue** is profound beyond measure,
Distant beyond sight,
So subtle and refined that it cannot be detected.
Yet observe its application—it seems contrary to things,
But examine its principle—it converges with the same end as things,
Entering the realm of natural spontaneity without resistance.

The **Perfect One** stands in opposition to the world and its myriad affairs,
Yet returns to simplicity and purity,
Aligning with the Great Harmony—
Great Harmony means no obstruction.
Thus it is said:
The **Mysterious Virtue** is profound and distant,
Contrary to things,
Only then does it reach the **Great Harmony**—
The ultimate harmony.

○ **Master He** says:
The Sage does not govern cleverness with cleverness,
Nor does He wander with the world in the realm of contrivances and schemes,
But governs cleverness with simplicity,
Drawing it back to the Dao of ease and straightforwardness—
How could this not be so?
Thus it is said: *The Sage*.

If cleverness exists without the Dao,
Then the world falls into great chaos.
How do we know this is so?
When the cleverness of bows, crossbows, and snares abounds,
Then birds are disturbed in the sky.
When the cleverness of nets, traps, and hooks abounds,
Then fish are disturbed in the water.
When the cleverness of deceit, poison, and sophistry—
The debates of *jié* and *huá*, the distinctions of firm and white,
The arguments of impurity and purity, of same and different—abounds,
Then people are bewildered by discourse.
Thus the world often falls into great chaos,
And the fault lies in the love of cleverness—
This has been so since the Three Dynasties.

To govern a nation with cleverness is to harm the people,
To govern without cleverness is to bless them.
To know these two models is also a standard—
This is the fine law for those who rule.
To always uphold this fine law,
Then the virtue becomes profound, deep, and distant.

Thus it is said:
Though Heaven and Earth are vast, their transformation is uniform,
Though myriad things abound, their governance is one,
Though the people are countless, their ruler is singular.
The ruler originates from virtue and is completed by Heaven—
Thus it is said:
The ancient Sage who ruled the world did so with *wuwei*,
For his virtue was that of Heaven itself.

To stand contrary to things—
They rely on their cleverness,
I rely on the **Mysterious Virtue**,
They rely on harm,
I rely on blessing—
Opposite yet never conflicting.
Straight speech as if reversed,
This is the **Great Harmony**—
The ultimate harmony.
How could it lie in private scheming or cleverness,
In clashing with things like blades,
And yet be unable to stop?

○ **Master Li** says:
*Wuwei* is broad and generous,
Bringing peace to the world—
This is the people’s blessing.
*Youwei* is meticulous and strict,
Dominating the people—
This is the nation’s ruin.
The difficulty in governing the people lies in their many affairs,
Thus the Sage governs the nation with *wuwei* and tranquility,
So that the clever may dare not act.
Though contrary to things,
This reversal penetrates natural spontaneity—
The people follow their nature,
Reaping a hundredfold blessings,
The world attains peace,
And the **Great Harmony** is fulfilled.
To exhaust this Dao is to embody the **Mysterious Virtue**.

**Chapter Sixty-Six**
The reason the rivers and seas can be kings of the myriad valleys
Is that they excel in humility.
Thus they become kings of the myriad valleys.

○ **Master Lü** says:
The rivers and seas reign over the myriad valleys
Through humility and lowliness,
Through emptiness and receptivity,
Through *wuwei* and seeking nothing—
And the hundred rivers naturally flow to them.
From this, we see that humility as Dao is great indeed.
In the human body, the lower *dantian* at the navel is the *qihai* (Sea of Qi),
The origin of the five *zàng* and six *fǔ*’s vital breath,
The source of the thirteen thousand five hundred breaths,
The ancestor of the twelve meridians.
If one diligently guards the *qihai* without interruption,
Then the *qi* of the hundred passes naturally converges there.

○ **Master He** says:
The rivers and seas do not resist the smallest streams,
Thus they achieve their greatness,
Naturally embodying the majesty of ruling the myriad valleys—
Yet this greatness is not forced.
Water has no division of east and west,
Only division of high and low.
The sea resides below, and thus the myriad valleys naturally pay homage.
The Classic says:
*"The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the seas."*
What Dao is this?
The Sage-King knows to embrace the yielding to guard the strong.

○ **Master Lin** says:
The waters of the myriad valleys all flow to the rivers and seas,
And though the rivers and seas are the exalted kings of the valleys,
They yet reside below the myriad valleys—
This is a metaphor borrowed from things,
Expressing the intent of humbling oneself to be exalted by others.
Thus the Sage, desiring to rise above others,
Must first speak in humility.
Desiring to lead others,
Must first place himself behind them.

「Thus, when the Sage stands above the people, they do not feel burdened;
When he leads before them, they do not feel harmed.
Hence, his virtue is pushed forward without ever being exhausted.

○ **Master Lü** says:
The Sage embodies the Way of humility and yielding,
And though he desires to stand above others,
He must first humble his words to them,
For he knows that arrogance invites loss.
Thus, his speech is modest and gentle,
His reputation is one of solitude and simplicity,
And by yielding to all things,
His virtue grows ever more exalted,
His great treasure ever more secure—
Naturally, others push him forward,
And he comes to stand above them.
When he wishes to lead all things,
He must first humble himself in speech and retreat in body,
Placing himself behind others.
For he carefully follows the Dao,
Never forcing himself before others,
Thus, he is pushed forward by all things
And comes to lead them.

Hence it is said:
*"When the Sage desires to stand above others,
He must first humble his words to them.
When he desires to lead others,
He must first place himself behind them.
Thus, he stands above others without burdening them—
And they follow him lightly.
He leads before others without harming them—
And they benefit greatly from him.
Not burdening, so not slighted;
Not harming, so not resisted.
Benefit and harm, lightness and burden—
These arise naturally.
How could there be room for scheming in his heart?
Thus, the world willingly embraces the Yellow Emperor’s
Clear and tranquil transformation,
And never tires of it—
For his humble and lowly virtue reaches far,
And the world joyfully pushes him forward without exhaustion.
The learned and noble naturally revere him,
Standing above others, leading them,
His brilliance concealed yet exalted—
A result of his virtue.
What exhaustion could there be?"*

○ **Master He** says:
The Sage’s heart is like the boundless void,
His Dao like the heavens and earth—
He awaits the world with gentle stillness.
What desires could he have?
To stand above others, to lead them—
He shows them what is worthy of imitation,
Speaking in accord with their nature.
What scheming could the Sage have?

People all seek blessings,
Yet he alone remains complete and unassuming—
Thus, when he stands above the people,
They do not feel burdened,
And those who press themselves below
Are exalted by others.
People all seek substance,
Yet he alone embraces emptiness—
Thus, when he leads before them,
They do not feel harmed,
And those who injure themselves by rushing forward
Are led by others.

He entrusts the small to contain the great,
His resolve weak yet his actions strong,
Ever wide and accommodating toward all things,
Never diminished by others.
What others naturally dislike and resent
Becomes their joyful endorsement—
No longer weary of his teaching.

○ **Master Wu** says:
*"To humble his words"* means to lower and bend his speech,
Not to exalt it.
*"To place himself behind"* means to retreat his body,
Not to advance it.
Yet these are all the Sage’s supreme virtues of modesty and yielding—
Not that he harbors any intent to stand above or lead others.
The reader must not let the words obscure the meaning.

○ **Master Lin** says:
The Sage does not first desire to stand above or lead others
And then act accordingly.
His intent is simply this:
Even the Sage, though he desires to stand above or lead others,
Still acts in this way—
How much more so others!
Because he does not contend,
The world cannot contend with him.

○ **Master Lü** says:
The Sage always treats his body as empty,
His heart as non-being.
Once his mind and form are settled,
Who could contend with him?
The *Classic* says:
*"You alone do not boast,
And thus none can contend with your ability.
You alone do not vaunt yourself,
And thus none can contend with your achievements."*
This is what is meant.

The Perfect One forgets his ears and eyes,
Discards his liver and gall,
Dissolves all attachments,
Erases all distinctions of self and world,
Harmonizes with the natural course,
And flows with all things—
Who then could contend with him?

○ **Master He** says:
Human hearts and the principles of the Dao
Can be moved by the Way, not by force.
Because he does not contend,
The world cannot contend with him.
What he upholds is sparse,
Yet those who submit to him are many—
This is the natural order.

Laozi once spoke to Wenzi:
*"The Sage who desires to be honored by others
Must first honor others.
The Sage who desires to humble others
Must first humble himself."*

**Chapter Sixty-Seven**
All under heaven say I am great—
Yet I seem unworthy.
Only because I am great
Do I seem unworthy.
If I were worthy,
Long ago I would have been insignificant.

○ **Master Lü** says:
The Dao is vast and formless, nameless,
Filling all things.
Though it exists, it seems as if it does not—
Its likeness to all things is nonexistent.
This is why it is great.
If it were to resemble any thing,
The Dao would itself be a thing—
And how could it then be great?

○ **Master Dong** says:
If it resembles anything,
It would be identical to one thing—
How could it then be great?

○ **Master He** says:
The Sage holds himself in profound virtue,
Not desiring to be seen as honored in the world.
Thus, the world regards him as boundlessly great,
Without resemblance to anything.

Only the great are indistinct and obscure—
No one can name them.
If they resemble anything,
They are merely petty in conduct.

○ **Master Lin** says:
One manuscript adds *"the Dao"* after *"I"* and *"also"* after *"insignificant"*—
Both are errors.

I have three treasures, which I hold fast.
The first is *compassion*,
The second is *frugality*,
The third is *not daring to lead the world*.

○ **Master Lü** says:
If a person embraces the Dao and governs himself
As one would hold a treasure,
He must surely cherish and guard it without loss.
The three practices he follows are:
To embody benevolence and widely bestow kindness,
Nurturing all living beings—this is *compassion*.
To use resources moderately and enrich others,
Not exhausting what belongs to all—this is *frugality*.
To never initiate action,
Harmonizing without instigating,
Daring not to lead—this is *not daring to lead*.

The Perfect One who preserves these three treasures
Extends broad relief to all suffering,
Clothes and shelters all things—
This is the utmost of *compassion*.
Frugality in hearing and seeing preserves the spirit from agitation,
Frugality in speech preserves the *qi* from depletion,
Frugality in desires preserves the heart from disturbance—
This is the supreme treasure for nourishing life.
Able to place himself behind others,
His humility naturally elevates him—
Thus it is said:
*"I have three treasures, which I hold fast—
The first is compassion,
The second is frugality,
The third is not daring to lead the world."*

○ **Master He** says:
The Sage does not regard jade and pearls as treasures,
But treasures only the Dao—
Which Dao?
The Dao of *compassion, frugality,* and *not daring to lead*.»

「A common man brandishing his sword and glaring fiercely—
This is the way of one who delights in bravery,
The *qi* of petty men seeking self-aggrandizement,
Yet I treasure *compassion* as my jewel.

To barricade one’s door with small vessels and fill it with wealth—
This is the way of one who delights in abundance,
The shallow vision of petty men in their self-indulgence,
Yet I treasure frugality as my jewel.

To pursue fame and gain, to vie with others—
This is the way of one who delights in leading,
The boastful arrogance of petty men calling it skill,
Yet I treasure *not daring to lead* as my jewel.»

○ **Master Wu** says:
*"Preserve"* means to hold fast without loss,
*Compassion* means gentle kindness, mercy without rigidity,
Frugality means moderation in small matters, restraint without excess,
*Not daring to lead* means humility and retreat without reckless advance—
Thus, though great, he seems not to excel.
For *compassion* is why he can be brave,
Frugality is why he can be expansive,
*Not daring to lead* is why he can be a master of affairs.

Now if one abandons *compassion* for mere bravery,
Abandons frugality for mere expansiveness,
Abandons humility for mere advancement—
Then death is certain!

○ **Master Lü** says:
To know humility and gentleness as superior to rigidity,
To follow the natural order of sentient beings—this is *compassion*—
Thus one may speak of bravery.
To know moderation and frugality as noble,
To use them without depletion—this is frugality—
Thus one may speak of expansiveness.
To know placing others before oneself as the way to restrain oneself and return to propriety,
To give only to the virtuous—
Thus one may become a master of affairs.

For rigidity is easily broken,
But *compassion* and gentleness are invincible.
*Compassion* is bravery without rigidity,
Frugality cherishes vital *qi* and essence,
Preserving spirit and clarity without exhaustion,
Thus my Dao grows ever broader.
I never lead others,
So my virtue is joyfully extended without end,
And I become the sovereign of the Dao’s instruments.
Thus it is said:
*Compassion* is why he can be brave,
Frugality is why he can be expansive,
*Not daring to lead* is why he can be a master of affairs.

Yet the world today does otherwise:
They discard *compassion* and virtue,
Pursuing mere bravery and righteousness,
Draining their *qi* and risking their lives,
Unable to preserve frugality in their use,
Exalting luxury and excess,
Wasting resources and harming the people,
Only to invite ruin and scarcity,
Lacking the heart for humility and retreat,
Yet harboring the will for rigidity and strength,
Delighting in taking the lead,
Shaming to follow others—
These are not the arts of longevity and greatness,
But tools for self-destruction.

Thus it is said:
Now if one abandons *compassion* for mere bravery,
Abandons frugality for mere expansiveness,
Abandons humility for mere advancement—
Then death is certain!

○ **Master Lin** says:
*"Instrument"* is form,
To *"become a master of affairs"* is to *"take form"*—
All things that take form upon the earth,
I make them my masters.
Thus it is said: *"become a master of affairs."*

Now people discard *compassion* and use only their bravery,
Discard frugality and use only their expansiveness,
Discard humility and use only advancement—
This is not the way to preserve life,
Thus it is said: *"Then death is certain!"*

○ **Master Wu** says:
*"Abandon"* means to not use.
To not use the treasures of *compassion*, frugality, humility, and retreat,
To employ rigidity as bravery,
Excess as expansiveness,
Reckless advance as leadership—
Then one will not be able to preserve life,
But will become a follower of death.

For *compassion* in war brings victory,
In defense brings security.
When Heaven intends to aid him,
It shields him with *compassion.*

○ **Master Lü** says:
Even *compassionate* armies entering enemy lands
Are seen as protectors by the people,
Spared the crops and graves,
Not plundered nor burned—
Thus all rejoice in them.
Why must one array soldiers to fight,
And only then achieve victory?
Heavily barred doors and nightly guards
Are the ways of defense and security.

Thus the Dao of Heaven rewards the virtuous and punishes the licentious,
The virtuous are naturally shielded by Heaven,
Their hearts and wills opened,
So they may be *compassionate* toward all things,
And when *compassionate* toward all things,
The world protects them.
The Perfect One can defend *compassionate* bravery against the world’s entanglements,
Then no thousand demons dare approach,
And his Dao grows ever more secure.
For Heaven’s Dao knows no favorites,
It always aligns with the virtuous.
Thus it is said:
*Compassion* in war brings victory,
In defense brings security,
When Heaven intends to aid him,
It shields him with *compassion.*

○ **Master Lin** says:
*"War"* is interaction with things that stir the heart,
Just as *Zhuangzi* says:
*"To engage with others is to clash—
Daily, the heart struggles within itself."*
*"Defense"* is like *Zhuangzi*’s *"preserving pure* qi*"—
If a man takes *compassion* as his master,
Then externally he can conquer things,
Internally he can preserve himself.
The earlier words on the three treasures,
Here I expound upon one—
To be *compassionate* is to embrace the other two within.

○ **Master Wu** says:
*Compassion* is the Dao of life,
The virtue of *ren*,
The foremost of the three treasures,
Thus below this, I speak solely of *compassion*—
The other two treasures are contained within it.

*Compassion* is what all men naturally love,
Like a father and mother—
Who would have a son who opposes his parents,
Who attacks his parents?

Thus, to wage war with *compassion*
Is to make men unwilling to resist—
This is true victory.
To defend with *compassion*
Is to make men unwilling to assault—
This is true security.

Even if there are raiders who come to attack or plunder,
Those who aid their parents are many,
And so they will surely be victorious and secure.
Or if human strength is insufficient,
Heaven will also aid and rescue them,
Not allowing them to be defeated and scattered.
Heaven’s aid comes because they are able to be *compassionate* and rescue others.

○ **Master Li** says:
The single character *compassion*
In war brings victory,
In defense brings security—
*Ren* is invincible,
This is true bravery.

**Chapter 68:**
The good *scholar-official* does not rely on force,
The good warrior does not grow angry,
The good victor does not quarrel,
The good user of men places them below himself.

○ **Master He** says:
Gongyi Bo was renowned for his strength among the feudal lords,
King Xuan of Zhou invited him with elaborate rites to inquire of his prowess,
Observing his frail appearance.
The king asked: *"How is your strength?"*
Gongyi Bo replied: *"My strength can break the leg of a spring grasshopper,
Sever the wings of an autumn cicada."*
The king said: *"My strength can split the hide of a rhinoceros,
Drag the tail of an oxen of nine thousand pounds—
Yet I still find you weak.
If your strength is renowned throughout the world, what is it for?"*
Gongyi Bo replied: *"Noble is your question, my lord!
My teacher, Shangqiuzi, had strength without rival in the world,
Yet even his six relations did not know of it—
Because he never used his strength.
Now my name is known to the feudal lords,
This means I have gone against my teacher’s instructions,
And displayed my own abilities.
Yet my fame does not come from my strength itself,
But from my ability to use my strength wisely."*

「Thus, the skillful in serving as the lower party are not aggressive—
This principle is clearly demonstrated in practice.
In *Zhuangzi*: the Market-South Comilou played with balls,
Yet the two families’ feud remained unresolved;
Sun Shu’ao lay content with his jade staff and feathered fan,
Yet the people of Ying cast down their weapons.
These are those who do not rage yet excel in battle,
Who do not contend yet triumph in victory.

Han Xin untied Guangwu Jun’s bonds,
Facing east to acknowledge him as a teacher,
Seeking strategies for Yan and Qi—
This is the skillful use of others as the lower party.

The ancient adept at being a warrior,
Did not seek to be fierce and strong;
In battle, he did not yield to anger or rage,
Yet victory over the enemy came without clashing strength—
For the Dao/Way was preserved within him.
Thus, some say, *"I excel in forming arrays!"*
*"I excel in waging war!"*—
This is a grave offense.

When a sovereign cherishes virtue/power of benevolence,
The world finds no rival.

○ The Wu School says: In ancient times, chariot warfare was practiced,
Where a warrior (*shi*) meant three armored soldiers on a chariot—
The left wielded the bow, the right the spear,
The central one drove the chariot, controlling the flags and drums,
All desired to be strong and aggressive in battle.
Seventy-two foot soldiers served beneath the chariot,
And when war was imminent, their courage was roused,
Their will to contend with the enemy sharpened,
So they might take victory.

But the benevolent way of wielding armies
Does not regard this as skillful.

Warriors do not wish to be strong and aggressive,
In battle, they do not seek to overwhelm with rage—
Victory over the enemy does not depend on matching strength,
Weapons are not drawn—
The enemy will yield themselves.
This is the wisdom and ability of the ancients.

○ The Lin School says: The excellence of these four lies
In the art of non-contention.
This is called the virtue/power of non-contention,
This is called the strength of using others,
This is called the harmony with Heaven’s ancient principle.
The He School says: The virtue/power of non-contention
Is benevolence without reliance on force.
The strength of using others
Is bending collective strategy to collective force.
Harmony with Heaven’s ancient principle
Is that Heaven’s Dao/Way does not contend yet excels in victory,
And has endured since antiquity—
The Way reaches its utmost.

○ The Lin School says: Because of its virtue/power of non-contention,
It can harmonize with Heaven,
It can bend collective force,
And govern the world—
Since antiquity, none have surpassed it.
Thus it is called the ancient principle.

○ The Li School says: The virtue/power of non-contention,
The strength of using others,
Both are rooted in benevolence and mercy—
Thus it is called harmony with Heaven.
By cultivating oneself thus,
One’s form is preserved and life prolonged.

○ The Chai School says: Only by aligning with the Dao/Way
Of the ancient sages can one stand at Heaven’s utmost—
Thus it is called harmony with Heaven’s ancient principle.

**Chapter 69: On Wielding Armies, there is a saying:**
*"I dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent.
I dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot."*

The He School says: *"I dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent"*
Is what is called *responding armies*—
Thus, *"relieving chaos and punishing tyranny"* is called *righteous armies*,
And armies of righteousness are invincible.
When one rises not by choice but necessity,
This is called *responding armies*—
And armies that respond will prevail.

To fight over petty grievances,
To bear grudges and refuse to yield in anger—
This is called *armies of resentment*—
And armies of resentment will be defeated.

To covet another’s land and treasures—
This is called *greedy armies*—
And greedy armies will be broken.

To rely on the might of one’s state,
To boast of the multitude of one’s people,
And to wish to intimidate the enemy—
This is called *proud armies*—
And proud armies will perish.

These five principles Laozi once spoke to Wenzhongzi,
Now he says: *"I dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent"*
Means the aggressor strikes first,
While the respondent answers afterward—
Not by choice.

*"I dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot"*
Means to advance when opportunity is seen,
To retreat when difficulty is known—
The utmost of caution,
Yet not cowardice.
To fear in battle yet succeed through careful planning.

○ The Lü School says: Those who spoke of military strategy in antiquity
Must have regarded the aggressor as the first to act,
And the respondent as the second to answer.
The aggressor creates the situation,
The respondent counters the enemy.

Moreover, the Sage’s armies are deep in strategy, subtle in deployment—
Though enemies come, we sit and watch their movements,
Adapting as they change,
Pressing only when forced,
Rising only when necessity demands.
If one acts lightly, this is called *reckless with the enemy*.

Generally, those who have intent to contend
May not necessarily win,
While those without intent to contend
May not necessarily lose—
Strategy and timing depend on circumstances.

The Perfect One responds to the world,
With one glance, one listening,
One word, one smile—
A thousand threads of interaction,
All called *magical illusions*.

The resolution of victory in battle
Lies in not daring to act as the aggressor first,
But maintaining a posture as the respondent,
Ever dwelling in stillness and composure,
With spirit unshaken—
Advancing an inch means meeting resistance,
Retreating a foot means avoiding contention.
Hence the saying: *"On wielding armies, there is a saying:
I dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent,
I dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot."*

Thus, in movement there is no formation,
In repelling there are no arms,
In drawing there are no enemies,
In grasping there are no soldiers.

The He School says: The usual state of armies is
Movement has formation,
Repelling has arms,
Drawing has enemies to face,
Grasping has soldiers to hold—
Yet here all are absent,
As though without hands to strike or fists to raise,
As though the enemy passes by like a teacher on a pillow or bed,
Bending without battle—
This is why it is so.

*Eran* (扔), means to draw or lure—
As in repelling with arms yet *eraning* them to lure,
*Eran* and *cai* (才) share the same sound in ancient texts,
With meaning akin to *waving the enemy away*.

○ The Master of the River Above said:
If they persist in wrongdoing,
They become thieves to the world—
Yet even if I wish to execute them,
No proper formation can be made.
Though I wish to rage in anger,
It is as though I have no arms to repel.
Though I wish to draw and lure them,
It is as though there are no enemies to draw.
Though I wish to grasp and hold them,
It is as though there are no soldiers to seize.

○ The Lin School says: These are all feints of cowardice and weakness
To deceive the enemy’s calculations.
*Eran* means to draw,
To lure the enemy to the teacher’s forces.

Thus, wielding armies in this way
Is the path to true victory.

To act lightly against the enemy and boast in arrogance,
One is certain to meet ruin and defeat.

○ The original text by Wang Bi retains *eran* (扔).

No calamity is greater than reckless contempt for the enemy—
Reckless contempt nearly loses all one holds dear.

When armies clash in opposition,
The compassionate will prevail.

The He School says: Do not ask *"what harm?"*—
The peril is immense.
This is the warning against reckless contempt for the enemy,
The greatest of calamities.»

The Sage holds compassion as his treasure,
And Heaven will rescue him—
Guarding him with compassion.
Now, when facing the enemy and lightly wielding one’s blade,
To seek victory over the world—
This is to first destroy one’s own Dao/Way’s treasure.

Hence, when two armies meet,
The compassionate and humble will prevail.
Thus it is said: *"View your soldiers as beloved children,"*
Thus they can die together.
To wage war with compassion is to win—
A single word moves the three armies,
Like one who embraces a babe and sucks a boil,
Yet soldiers and their fathers fight to the death—
Who then would dare oppose?

This passage states that armies cannot be lightly used,
And yet not using them is their greatest application—
There is a way beyond mere military force.

○ The Wu School says: He who leads the three armies,
When confronted with battle, fears—
He does not dare to lightly scorn the enemy.
To lightly scorn the enemy is to lightly engage in war,
And thus to bring slaughter upon oneself while losing one’s compassionate treasure—
No calamity is greater.

Though war has not yet been entered,
Yet once the heart holds even a trace of contempt for the enemy,
There is the gradual risk of killing and losing one’s treasure—
Hence it is said: *"Nearly lose my treasure."*

*Ant* means to raise,
The compassionate reveal their Dao/Way’s virtue/power,
And Heaven and humanity aid them to victory.

○ The Su School says: When two enemies raise their armies against each other,
And I act only out of necessity,
Then I bear pity and mercy for the slain—
Compassion is revealed, and Heaven and humanity assist in my顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺顺

The Way is known by none, practiced by none.

Master He said: What is the Way? It is clarity and stillness, simplicity and ease above all. The Way is inherently clear, yet people muddy it; inherently still, yet people agitate it; inherently simple, yet people complicate it; inherently easy, yet people make it difficult.

The Mysterious Sage speaks: To me, it is most easy to know and to practice; to others, it is impossible to know or to do. The method differs not—it is simply a return to its origin.

To speak of strength and rigidity is difficult; to speak of gentleness and weakness, is it not easy? To speak of ornate adornment is difficult; to speak of plainness and simplicity, is it not easy? Yet because it is so easy to know, people fail to know it; because it is so easy to practice, people fail to do it—because it is too near.

Liezi could lift a single autumn hair and hear the thunder—these were the words of one who knew the Way.

Master Li said: The previous chapter spoke of the compassionate prevailing, meaning that benevolence is invincible. Thus, it follows with "most easy to know, most easy to practice," yet the world cannot know or practice it—truly, their faith is insufficient. Even those with faith cannot act—truly, their strength is insufficient.

Master Wu said: The teachings of Laozi instruct one only in gentleness, weakness, and humility. His words are most easy to know, his deeds most easy to practice. Yet as the age declines and customs corrupt, none in the world can know their worth, nor practice gentleness, weakness, and humility.

Words have their source, deeds have their master.
Only those without knowledge fail to recognize me.
Few know me, thus I am noble.

Master He said: Laozi’s two phrases—"words have their source, deeds have their master"—yet he repeatedly speaks of discarding words, of doing without doing, saying, "You have lost your origin." Though eloquence may abound, it is not as good as few words. This is so.

Hold fast to the essential, grasp the root—then you will know how to know, how to practice, how to make it easy.
There is nothing else: broad knowledge is difficult for the few; many revere this, and thus knowing becomes easy. Broad practice is difficult for the restless; many submit to this, and thus acting becomes easy.

Yet the teachings of the Way have three aspects: what is most easy is near; what is unknown is subtle; and what is without knowledge is forgotten. Thus, the Way, though easy to know, reaches the state of being unknown.

The Sage’s deeds are such: I transcend the realm of recognition and knowledge, who then can measure me?
Guan Yinzi could forget the Way only to possess the Way. He also said: If someone asks me, I do not even know myself—how could I know what they seek? This is without words, without deeds, an inner knowing that embraces the Mysterious.

I do not even know myself—how could others know me? If people can know the Way, what is there to value?
Thus, those who attain the Way fear being known by others, yet first fear knowing themselves. Self and others both forgotten—clouds and mist vanish together.

The most noble is the Way. The great sound is rare in voice—why seek knowledge at all?
Yet the difficulty and ease of knowing are not worth discussing.

Master Lin said: Among many words, there must be the supreme word, hence "words have their source." All deeds in the world have the Way as their master, hence "deeds have their master." Since the world lacks those who know the supreme word and the supreme Way, none recognize me, hence "only those without knowledge fail to recognize me."

Thus, the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.
Master He said: Liezi dwelled in the fields of Zheng for forty years, unrecognized. Even the king and ministers regarded him as common folk. The virtuous man’s noble bearing appears foolish—thus, the Sage is like one wearing coarse cloth while harboring jade: externally unassuming, yet internally possessing the most noble treasure. *Pò* (褐) is coarse hemp cloth, the garment of the lowly, hence "wide and ample."

Master Lü said: The Sage has no name; the Perfect Man has no self; the Divine Man has no brilliance. Though his robes are worn and his sandals threadbare, he nurtures his integrity beneath them. His heart is like jade and stone, accumulating the utmost treasure, concealing its radiance, never displaying it. He silently nurtures the embryo of the Way—thus, "the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade."

Master Lin said: The Sage’s Way suffices within and does not manifest without—like wearing coarse cloth while harboring jade. Thus, people cannot see it.

**Chapter Seventy-One**
To know what is unknown—this is supreme.

「To not know what one knows—this is a malady.
Only by recognizing this malady as a malady can one avoid it.
The Sage does not suffer from this malady because he recognizes it as a malady, hence does not suffer from it.

Master Lin said: When one attains supreme knowledge yet behaves as if ignorant, this is the highest Dao.
When one presumes to know within the realm of the unknowable, this is the sickness of learning the Dao.
If one can recognize this presumption as a malady and treat it as such, then this malady will be cured.
The Sage’s way of not suffering from it is that he recognizes this presumption as a malady and treats it as such—this is the most wondrous chapter.

Master Li said: "To know what is unknown" is easy to understand when linked to the previous chapter: The Sage knows all things yet does not presume to know—this is true knowledge.
The common folk know nothing yet presume to know—this is false knowledge, hence "malady."
If one knows that false knowledge is a malady and treats it as such, then the malady of false knowledge will be cured.
The Sage does not suffer from this malady because he recognizes false knowledge as a malady and treats it as such—thus he does not suffer from it.

Master Lü said: How profound and wondrous is the Dao! It is vast and silent, deep and unfathomable—
It cannot be grasped by intellect, cannot be discerned by perception,
Cannot be measured or estimated, cannot be approximated or debated.
Knowledge is external to it; ignorance is internal to it.
Knowledge is shallow; ignorance is profound.
The Sage perceives the purity of *qi*—his inherent nature is lofty and bright.
Within, he harbors true knowledge; all things are naturally awakened.
Only then can he attain true ignorance, not boasting of himself—
This is called true knowledge and true perception,
For he knows the unknowing and the unperceiving.

Moreover, the common folk do not know the essence of the Dao,
Yet they know the coarse aspects of things.
They do not know the ultimate of the Dao,
Yet they know the trifling ends of things.
They are enslaved by schemes and deceived by phenomena,
Their minds filled with cunning, vainly seeking grandeur,
Yet they truly do not know the Dao.
They exhaust their spirit, strain their thoughts,
Using elaborate words to extinguish essence, using superficiality to drown the heart,
And forcefully argue and justify, claiming to know—
This is the malady of *virtue/power*.

The noble ones attain the Dao and clarify truth;
They possess it yet remain humble,
Sealing their lips and tongues,
Preserving and concealing it, never daring to reveal it.
They always act as if ignorant—how much more so when they do not know the Dao—
Yet they indulge in lofty, boastful debates.
Debaters are not virtuous; knowers are not profound; the profound are not knowers.

Master He said: The *Zhuangzi* states: "There have been those who knew through hearing, but never those who knew through ignorance."
Hence, deep knowledge without presumption is the highest in the Dao.
In the realm of the unknowable, to forcefully presume knowledge—
This is the malady of learning the Dao.
The *Zhuangzi* says: *Taicheng* asked *Wuqiong*, "Do you know the Dao?"
He replied, "I do not know."
Again, he asked *Wuwei*, "I know the Dao."
He asked *Wuji* (the beginningless), and he replied,
"I do not know its depths; knowledge is shallow.
I do not know its interior; knowledge is external."
*Taicheng* knew and sighed, saying:
"To not know is to know; to know is to not know—
Who knows the knowing of not knowing?"

**Chapter Seventy-Two**
When the people do not fear *威* (威), the greatest fear has arrived.

Master *He Shang Gong* (河上公) said: *威* (威) is harm; people cannot but fear small harm.
If they do not fear small harm, great harm will arrive.

Master Lü said: The *junzi* (君子) has three fears:
Fear of Heaven’s decree (*天命*),
Fear of great *virtue/power* (大人),
Fear of the Sage’s words.
If one embodies constancy and adapts to change,
Preserving the principles of life and death,
Then within, true essence is manifest and fills all without.
Anxiety and sorrow cannot penetrate it—
What the multitude fears, one cannot but fear.
The foolish do not know Heaven’s decree,
Seeking only grandeur and excess,
Bearing harm and relying on power,
Boasting of their virtue and ability.
The *Zhuangzi* (*Nanhua Jing*) says:
The great foolish never awaken;
The great confused never enlighten.
Do not say that minor evil causes no harm—
If one neglects it and does not repent,
Then when harm accumulates over time,
Even human *威* cannot be added,
And Heaven’s *威* will surely come.

Master He said: The ancients said,
"To fear *威* as one fears illness is the highest for the people;
To follow *威* as one follows a flowing current is the lowest for the people;
To see *威* and think of *威* is the middle for the people."
Thus, the human heart must never lack something to fear.
Confucius said: The *junzi* has three fears—
Fear of Heaven’s decree,
Fear of great *virtue/power* (大人),
Fear of the Sage’s words.
The petty do not fear Heaven’s decree,
They are familiar with great *virtue/power*,
And scorn the Sage’s words.
Great *virtue/power* refers to the sternness of rulers and parents,
As well as the great *virtue/power* of the worthy—
These are indeed worthy of fear, not to be trifled with.
The Sage’s words: to violate his precepts,
One cannot escape punishment.
Their bodies are indeed worthy of fear, not to be scorned.
Yet among the three fears, fear of Heaven’s decree is paramount.
Heaven’s decree is the natural principle bestowed upon all things by Heaven.
To fear it, every thought and word is under the gaze of Heaven and Earth, ghosts and gods—
None dare to play or neglect it.
The Dao is the shared source of all things; those who attain it live, those who lose it die.
The people receive the essence of Heaven and Earth to live,
The capable take blessings, the corrupt take calamity—
Thus, the *junzi* fears *yì* (义), the petty fear *xíng* (刑).
Both fear Heaven.
If one does not fear this *威*, then there is a greater *威*.
The *Yì* says: "If evil is not accumulated, it is not enough to destroy one’s life."
The petty presume minor evil causes no harm and do not abandon it,
So evil accumulates and cannot be concealed,
Guilt becomes great and cannot be absolved,
And they are punished to death—*凶* (凶), is this not the great *威* that comes from not fearing *威*?

Master Lin said: Those who do not fear *xíng* (刑) will often meet it.
Do not narrow one’s dwelling, do not weary of one’s birth—
Thus, one does not weary.
Master *He Shang Gong* said: The heart should dwell in the Divine (*神*), broad and gentle,
Not narrow and rigid.
The reason people are born is to possess spirit *qi*—
If one neglects its Dao, indulging only in its superficial manifestations,
This is called harming the root and wearying the Divine.»

Only those who do not weary of *spirit-qi* can wash their heart clean of defilement,
purify their mind of filth, and remain undisturbed by desire—
then *spirit-qi* abides within them without weariness.

Master *He* said:
When one dwells with the Dao, they can inhabit the boundless dwelling of the world,
so one must not narrow their own abode.
Otherwise, even a room will seem empty and void,
and discord will arise between wives and mothers-in-law.

When one is born through the Dao, they can nurture all that heaven and earth bring forth,
so one must not weary of their own birth.
Otherwise, the mind will lack celestial wandering,
and the six passions will vie for dominance.

Only those who take joy in the Dao and do not weary within themselves
will not be seen as weary by heaven above or by people below—
thus, none will weary of them.

Master *Lin* said:
*Residence* is the realm of boundless dwelling,
*birth* is the principle of enduring life and long vision.
All people narrow their own abode and weary of their own birth,
unable to rest in retreat while pursuing advancement,
unable to observe the void while bewildered by the manifest—
this is self-narrowing, self-wearying.

*The void* is a warning against such conduct, saying it must not be so.

Only those who do not weary can endure long and be at peace—
thus, it is said: *therefore, none weary.*

Master *Dong* said:
*Narrow* means confined, *weary* means to abandon.
*Wu* (无) should be read as *wu* (毋).
*Residence* is the foundation of nature—
to dwell in the world’s boundless abode is to merge with the Great Void.
*Birth* is the gathering of *qi*—
to contain the utmost essence of the Great Unity is to harmonize with the creative force.

Only the narrow-minded cannot be spoken to of the Dao.
If one does not drown in petty techniques
but instead embodies the void in reality,
they will abandon the manifest to cling to the void,
and be obscured by annihilation,
thus wearying of their own birth.
Therefore, one is told: *Do not narrow, do not weary,*
so that scholars may know that nature is the leader of *qi*,
its vastness boundless—
one must expand and fill it to preserve its greatness.

*Birth* is the Dao’s manifestation, its use inexhaustible—
one must cherish and nurture it to fulfill its purpose,
thus nurturing *qi* to perfect life,
exhausting nature to attain the Mandate,
and never harboring the mind of abandonment—
this is how one embodies strength without force,
and softness without weakness,
long life without greed for life,
and life not as something lowly.

Thus, one dwells with life and the Dao,
and the Dao never abandons them.

Therefore, the Sage knows themselves without revealing themselves,
loves themselves without esteeming themselves—
thus, they discard the former and take the latter.

Master *He Shang Gong* said:
*Self-knowing* is to discern one’s own gains and losses;
*not revealing oneself* is to conceal virtue and beauty within.
*Self-loving* is to cherish one’s body and preserve *jing-qi*;
*not esteeming oneself* is to reject high honor and fame in the world.
*Discarding the former* means discarding self-revelation and self-aggrandizement;
*taking the latter* means embracing self-knowledge and self-love.

Master *He* said:
The Sage who knows themselves does not dare obscure right and wrong, beauty and evil,
while self-revelation breeds the mind of self-sufficiency.
Self-love ensures one does not act lightly toward safety and danger, retreat and advance,
while self-responsibility stirs the arrogance of pride—
this is how the distinction between fear and non-fear is made.

Between the one and the other—what to discard, what to take—
how can one not know what to choose?

The *Collected Commentaries on the True Classic of the Dao* concludes here.

**Chapter Seventy-Third:**
*"Courageous in daring brings death; courageous in not daring brings life.
This pair—sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful—
what the Heavenly detests, who knows its cause?
Thus the Sage finds it difficult.*

Master **Lin** said:
*Those courageous in daring will surely harm themselves;
hesitating before matters is courage in not daring.
Life comes from preserving oneself,
while daring brings harm and not daring brings benefit—
these two are clearly understood.
Heaven detests fullness and favors humility,
so the daring are not only reviled by men,
but also by Heaven.
Yet few perceive its cause,
hence the saying: "who knows its cause?"
The Sage finds it difficult because
this Dao is hard to grasp.*

Master **He** said:
*The overbearing will not meet their end,
those who love victory will surely meet their foe—
this is daring, the warning of death.
Hesitating before matters, planning carefully to succeed—
this is courage in not daring, the Way of life.
This is why the saying holds:
the noble will prosper, the petty will perish.
Yet these two—sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful—
those who do good often meet fortune,
while those who do ill may sometimes escape harm.
From the first part, prosperity and misfortune
depend on good and evil,
like the interplay of light and shadow.
From the latter, calamity and blessing
seem not of our own making.
Ordinary minds thus conclude:
Heaven’s preferences and dislikes are inscrutable,
its causes are unfathomable,
its deeds are untrustworthy.
The Sage reveres Heaven’s command,
cultivates their virtue to await its unfolding,
never daring to apply ordinary reasoning lightly.
Only knowing Heaven does not aid the reckless,
but demands caution—
how could it lack cause?*

Master **Li** said:
*Continuing from the previous chapter:
the people do not fear authority,
so how can authority use death to frighten them?
If the people were always afraid of death,
and yet someone dared to act strangely and perversely,
I could seize and kill them—
who would dare?*
Master **Lin** said:
*This chapter explains that distinguishing good and evil,
preferring or rejecting by one’s own will—
all this stems from ignorance of the Dao,
so the ruler is likened to those who enforce punishment.
The ruler merely uses death to frighten the people,
yet the people never truly fear death.
If the people truly feared death,
then those who acted strangely and perversely
I could seize and punish—
then none would dare.
But now, the strange and perverse are killed,
yet the people’s offenses grow daily—
then how have the people ever feared death?*

Master **Wu** said:
*"Strange" means "unorthodox."
If the people were always afraid of death,
and yet the unorthodox and perverse still acted wickedly,
I could seize and kill them—
then who would dare?
But even if wicked men are killed,
those who dare to act wickedly do not cease—
this means the people are foolish and do not know to fear death.
Though those who do evil must surely face punishment,
they still fear nothing.
How can the ruler use death to frighten them,
yet casually take lives?*

Master **He of the Yellow River** said:
*Laozi laments that the kings of his age
do not first cultivate Dao and virtue to transform the people,
but instead rely on punishments.
Those who merely enforce punishments,
when they kill, are like carpenters replacing the master—
few escape harm to their own hands.*

**Chapter Seventy-Fourth:**
*"If the people do not fear death,
how can you threaten them with death?
If the people were always afraid of death,
and yet someone acted strangely and perversely,
I could seize and kill them—
who would dare?"*

Master **Lin** said:
*This chapter states that distinguishing good and evil,
preferring or rejecting by one’s own will—
even to the point of excess—
all this is not of the Dao.
Thus the ruler is likened to those who enforce punishment,
explaining that punishment is merely used to frighten the people with death,
yet the people never truly fear death.
If the people truly had fear of death,
then those who acted strangely and perversely
I could seize and punish—
then none would dare.
But now, the strange and perverse are killed,
yet the people’s offenses only multiply—
then how have the people ever feared death?*

Master **He of the Yellow River** said:
*Laozi grieves over the times when kings
do not first uphold Dao and virtue to transform the people,
but instead begin with punishments.
Those who merely take the place of the executioner,
when they kill, are like apprentices replacing the master carpenter—
few escape injury to their own hands.*

Lin Shi said:
*The killer is the Creator. Between Heaven and Earth, whether one does good or evil, there is always one who holds the authority over life and death. Those who should be killed are killed by the Creator itself, hence the saying that there is always one who holds the authority over killing. For a state to be overly concerned with punishment, it is as if one were substituting for the Creator in wielding the authority to kill. Just as a clumsy artisan replacing the master carpenter in cutting wood will rarely avoid injuring their own hands, this is a metaphor within a metaphor. This passage arises from the times’ excessive fondness for killing, yet its intent is not to entirely abolish punishment. Heaven’s retribution for guilt must simply be without malice.*

Wu Shi said:
*If one does not use killing to instill fear in the people, then should those who commit evil not be killed? The one who holds the authority to kill is Heaven itself. Only Heaven can kill, just as only the master carpenter can carve wood. For a man to presume to replace Heaven in killing is like one who is not a carpenter attempting to carve wood in the master’s place. Those who substitute for the carpenter will inevitably injure their hands, and by analogy, those who substitute for Heaven in killing will inevitably harm themselves. Without human calamity, there must be Heaven’s punishment.*

He Shi said:
*Though punishment may be wielded by one person, it is not the private domain of any single individual. There is always one who holds authority over punishment and killing. The ruler, in governing, should not presume to take this role upon themselves. Who, then, is the one who holds the authority to kill? Above, there is one who operates in the unseen—Heaven’s retribution for guilt, the Five Punishments, and their proper applications. Below, there is one who operates in the manifest—*as the *Shu* says: *"The officers regulate the people within the bounds of punishment."* The ruler, holding the reins in between, enforces punishment only when necessary. When such necessity arises, they uphold Heaven’s decrees and entrust the matter to the proper authorities, demonstrating fair governance to the people: *"The people have their own guilt; what concern is it of mine?"* Killing is the domain of Heaven, of the officers—not mine. Who would dare blame their ruler for this? If this is not followed, it defies Heaven’s order, misuses official punishment, and arrogates its authority as one’s own—just as if the master carpenter should step aside while another, bloodied and exhausted, takes their place in cutting wood. Would this not bring harm?*

*The ruler, with the heart of Heaven and humanity, desires goodness, and thus the people become good. Why then the need for killing? If a ruler governs thus, the world will shift toward virtue and away from guilt, all cherishing life and valuing death. They will welcome the great harmonizing *qi*, this being the unspoken intent of the Sage.*

**Chapter Seventy-Five**
*The people’s hunger arises from their rulers taking too much in taxes. Thus, they hunger. The people are difficult to govern because their rulers act excessively. Thus, they are difficult to govern.*

Lin Shi said:
*"Too much in taxes"* refers to the ruler taking excessively from the people. *"Their rulers act excessively"* means those in governance overuse schemes and stratagems. When the ruler is greedy for profit, the people grow hungrier. When the ruler favors cleverness, the people grow harder to govern.

Wu Shi said:
*"Food"* refers to what the ruler takes from the people, while *"taxes"* are what the people contribute to sustain the ruler’s consumption. If the ruler takes too much from the people, the people grow poor and hungry. If the ruler governs with schemes and stratagems, the people respond with deceit and trickery, making governance difficult.

Lü Shi said:
*The people are the foundation of the state. Of the Eight Governments, food is the priority. Though the discussion of food may seem trivial, the Minister of Agriculture oversees it as a matter of great consequence. If this is mismanaged, harm to the people will be severe. The Sage allotted land, exhorted officials, and ensured they did not disrupt the seasons. Taxation was regulated to avoid overburdening the people. The *Nine-Tenths* law was relaxed, and the *Tenth* tax was established—prioritizing what was lightest. If, however, the ruler disregards the people’s proper seasons, drains their strength with extraordinary demands to satisfy insatiable desires, the people will suffer under the crushing weight of taxes. Exhausted and emaciated, they will show signs of famine, the wilds will echo with the cries of the starving, bandits and thieves will multiply, and deceit will flourish unseen within the state. The body relies on *qi* for the people’s vitality; when *qi* is depleted, the spirit weakens. Now, speaking of their hunger is to say their *qi* is insufficient. This is why they cannot abandon speech and desire—hence, *"The people’s hunger arises from their rulers taking too much in taxes. Thus, they hunger."* In ancient times, the people lived in peace, content with their customs, their fields yielding enough to eat, their weaving enough to wear. Who would say they were difficult to govern? But if the ruler acts with excess, desire, and interference—imposing dense nets of laws, harsh decrees, and convoluted governance—they will only agitate the people, who cannot endure such disturbance. Thus, they are difficult to govern. It is like one’s own breath: difficult to purify but easy to foul, easy to coarsen but difficult to refine. How much more so when the ruler’s actions agitate it further?*

*The people’s indifference to death arises from their excessive pursuit of life. Only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.*

Lin Shi said:
*Generally, those who love themselves too much risk losing their lives. Overindulgence in food and drink can bring illness—this is one example. Overvaluing self-preservation and excessive care for life lead to reckless schemes to secure it, hence *"the excessive pursuit of life."* They risk their lives in pursuit of it, hence *"indifferent to death."* To forget the self is to preserve the self, hence *"those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it."* To prize life is akin to the previous chapter’s *"increasing life"*—the excessive pursuit of life. *"Prize"* here means *"excel."**

Wu Shi said:
*"Indifferent"* means *"easy."* *"The excessive pursuit of life"* refers to an overattachment to living. *"Wiser"* means *"excel."* To prize life is to hold it in high regard, the same as the excessive pursuit of life. When one’s attachment to life is heavy and self-preservation is overdone, they may seek not to die yet instead make death easy. The perfected do not fail to cherish life, but they follow nature, harboring no contrivances. If one does not cling to life, their body remains unharmed—this excels over those who prize life with their hearts, yet paradoxically make death easy.

He Shi said:
*"Those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it."* This is what is meant by *"harmonizing with the Creator"* and *"wandering in the unified qi of Heaven and Earth."* They forget their liver and gallbladder, abandon their ears and eyes, reversing and returning to the beginning and end without knowing where to start or stop. Lost in the vastness beyond dust and filth, they drift effortlessly in the realm of *wuwei*, unharmed by things. This surpasses those who excessively cherish life—through this, all under Heaven preserve their lives. Is this not wondrous?

**Chapter Seventy-Six**
*"The living are soft and weak; the dead are rigid and strong.*
*All things—grasses and trees—are soft and brittle when alive; when dead, they wither and decay."*

Lu Shi said:
*"The Dao is the master of the spirit; the spirit is the master of qi; qi is the master of the body. When the Dao abides, the spirit abides; when the spirit abides, qi abides. Thus, when a person is born, they contain the primordial *yuanhe* qi and embrace the true unity of essence. Their form is whole, their spirit flourishes, and the myriad *jing* converge at the origin, flowing and ceasing not. Hence, their softness and weakness are evident.*

*When they die, the *yuanhe* qi disperses, the true unity of essence is exhausted, the form decays, and the spirit departs. Then the hundred limbs grow rigid and strong. Hence it is said: ‘The living are soft and weak; the dead are rigid and strong.’*

*Consider this: when grasses and trees are born, the qi of Heaven and Earth flows within them, and the yin-yang qi nourishes them without. When spring qi stirs, the nourishing rain falls abundantly, and sprouts unfold in lush splendor. Yet when frost and wind blow, killing qi follows, and they wither, their branches and twigs decaying.*

*The enlightened see life and death as the abiding or fading of the Dao; the unenlightened see vitality and decay as the gathering or scattering of qi. Hence it is said: ‘All things—grasses and trees—are soft and brittle when alive; when dead, they wither and decay.’"*

Wu Shi said:
*"When a person lives, their flesh and skin are soft and supple, capable of bending and stretching. When dead, their flesh and skin grow cold and rigid, unable to bend or stretch. Grasses and trees, when alive, have pliable stems; when dead, their stems wither and harden."*

Lin Shi said:
*"Soft and weak, rigid and strong—these are metaphors. Laozi’s teaching emphasizes valuing softness, thus using the birth and death of humans and plants as illustrations. Therefore, those who are rigid and strong are companions of death, while those who are soft and weak are companions of life."*

Lu Shi said:
*"Where yang qi resides, even wood can be bent and grass bound. Where yang qi departs, even water can congeal and ice shatter. Thus, the luminous yang qi is the root of life. Softness and weakness are the sprouts of things. Those who seek rigidity must guard it with softness; those who seek strength must preserve it with weakness. Now, rigidity cannot nurture harmony—it opposes things. How could it avoid harm? Softness and weakness do not lose the mean—they move with things, thus preserving life."*

He Shi said:
*"The soft and weak of the world—the Dao and qi—are what permeate Heaven and Earth and embrace all things. Thus, those who align with life must have the Dao and qi within them; those who align with death must have the Dao and qi depart from them."*

Lin Shi said:
*"Companions—here meaning ‘kindred.’"*

Wu Shi said:
*"The earlier text speaks of the forms of humans and plants—when alive, they are soft; when dead, they are rigid. Extending this principle, one sees that those whose conduct is rigid and strong do not attain death properly—they are companions of death. Those who are soft and weak preserve life well—they are companions of life. Hence, strong armies do not conquer, and strong trees are felled. The strong and mighty are placed below; the soft and weak are placed above."*

Lu Shi said:
*"Arms are instruments of violence and conflict, clashing with opposing forces. Relying on strength and despising the enemy is unrighteous. To act unrighteously and yet presume victory—how could it succeed? Thus it is said: ‘Strong arms do not conquer.’ Small trees are soft and weak, but when they grow strong, they become thick enough to encircle with both hands. If wood is thus, how much more so for humans? How much more so for nations? Hence it is said: ‘Strong trees are felled.’ The strong and mighty are bold warriors; the soft and weak embody the Way of the gentleman. Those who rely on force see strength as victory; those who rely on virtue see softness as victory. Thus, there is an eternal victorious Way called softness, and an eternal defeated Way called rigidity. Alas, the world’s people rely on force, not virtue, forgetting the root and chasing the branches. The enlightened observe this with the Dao, and thus know that softness overcomes rigidity—this is the necessary truth."*

He Shi said:
*"Sharp teeth break; the soft tongue survives—this is the way. ‘Felled’ as in encircling a tree with both hands—things grow old when they reach their peak; this is called *not the Dao*. Why do strong arms fail to conquer? Because they rely on the might of their nation, boast in their people’s numbers, and seek to intimidate enemy states—these are *proud armies*, and proud armies perish. The strong and mighty are placed below; the soft and weak are placed above—not merely an analogy with trees, but the application of softness to govern the world, which is the Way of the sovereign. To arrogantly exalt oneself is but the shortsightedness of a well-frog. Can those in high station not take heed? It is not only Daoists who uphold humility and weakness."*

Lin Shi said:
*"Those who rely on the strength of arms will not conquer. Young trees are soft and weak; when they grow old and rigid, they reach a thickness where they can be encircled with both hands—then they wither. Thus, those who understand the Dao value softness and weakness as superior, and rigidity and strength as inferior."*

Wu Shi said:
*"‘Felled’—the encircling of a tree with both hands."*

Dong Shi said:
*"This chapter speaks of how softness and weakness preserve the harmonious qi."*

**Chapter Seventy-Seven**
*"The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow: the high are lowered, the low are raised, the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented."*

「Lü Shi said:
*"The Dao of Heaven follows the Way of Dao, sharing its function: it accomplishes without action, transforms without speech. The four seasons rely on it to unfold, and all things await it to flourish. It never strays from its course, yet never fails in its impartial, upright principle. Hence, it is said: ‘The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow.’*

*Now, the artisan who crafts a bow—without slaying or sparing, without favor or coercion—shapes it by compass and square, guided by true measure. If the string is too high or too taut, he relaxes and softens it; if too low or slack, he draws and tightens it. What is in excess is trimmed away, what is lacking is filled in, so that the bow may be bent and the arrows may fly.*

*The ruler’s Way should emulate Heaven’s: to suppress the strong and support the weak, to diminish excess and supplement deficiency, to loosen and tighten, to refine and temper—so that every stroke finds its mark, and precision is the Dao. To balance gain and loss, to apply measures justly, to act as outer and inner counterpart—this aligns with Heaven’s function.*

*Heaven’s principle is grasped in the heart and executed by the hand, hence the saying: ‘The high are lowered, the low are raised, the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.’*

○ *Li Shi said:*
*"Continuing the previous chapter’s meaning of strength and weakness—diminishing excess, supplementing deficiency—that is the Way of Heaven.*
*Those who are strong and great must be diminished; those who are weak must be benefited."*

○ *Dong Shi said:*
*"Heaven’s Way is without partiality, all must conform to moderation.*
*Heaven’s Way diminishes excess and supplements deficiency. But human ways are otherwise: we diminish deficiency to serve excess."*

○ *Lü Shi said:*
*"To act without doing yet hold in esteem—that is Heaven’s Way. To have doing yet remain humble—that is humanity’s Way.*
*Heaven’s Way is to govern through transformation; humanity’s is to administer through ritual. Heaven, when in excess, diminishes; when lacking, bestows. This cannot be grasped by those with intent, nor approached by those without intent—it responds naturally and acts in silence.*

*But humanity is not so. Our nature strays from balance, our emotions are divided; we prefer the high and despise the low, serve the full and discard the empty, unable to align with Heaven’s principle of diminishing and supplementing. Thus, we are far from the Dao."*

○ *Lin Shi said:*
*"Heaven, in its treatment of all things, is ever thus.*
*Yet why does humanity’s Way differ? It seeks to diminish others while benefiting itself, to take from the world’s deficiency to fill its own excess—this is contrary to Heaven’s intent.*
*Who can sacrifice their own excess to nourish the world? Only those who embody the Dao."*

○ *Lü Shi said:*
*"Moreover, excess cannot be left untrimmed, deficiency cannot be left unsupplemented.*
*Thus, those who embody the Dao do not only love their own kin nor only cherish their own children—they love the world’s children as their own. In their regard for others, they are heavy; in their regard for themselves, they are light. Who but the sages could achieve this?*
*Hence the saying: ‘Who can sacrifice their own excess to nourish the world? Only those who embody the Dao.’"*

○ *Lin Shi said:*
*"Only those who embody the Dao can diminish my excess to nourish the world."*

○ *Li Shi said:*
*"Only those who embody the Dao act in accordance with Heaven, diminishing artificiality while benefiting true nature, diminishing abundance while supplementing scarcity, diminishing self while benefiting others, diminishing excess and supplementing deficiency—diminishing again and again until it reaches the state of non-action.*
*Hence, the sage acts yet does not rely on his deeds, achieves yet does not claim his accomplishments, and does not desire to be seen as virtuous. He does not boast of his own excellence or seek self-satisfaction; though his deeds are done and his affairs settled, he does not dwell upon them. He does not wish for the world to know his virtue—if his virtue were manifest to all, then he would be esteeming himself, which is not the way of the Dao."*

○ *Lü Shi said:*
*"The sage’s wisdom is all-encompassing, his mind adapts to all things. Though he benefits all things, he does not claim righteousness; though his grace extends to all ages, he does not claim benevolence. He has no intent to praise himself, acting yet not boasting of his skill, nor seeking self-fulfillment. When his deeds are accomplished and his affairs settled, he does not dwell upon them—he does not wish for others to know his virtue. If his virtue were made known to the world, then he would be esteeming himself, which is not the way of the Dao."*

○ *Lin Shi said:*
*"Though the sage acts in the world, he does not rely on his deeds; though his accomplishments are realized, he does not claim them; though his conduct is the most virtuous, he does not wish to be seen for it. This is the Dao’s principle of continual diminishment—until one diminishes even the act of diminishment."*

○ *Wu Shi said:*
*"The sage’s achievements can cover the world—this is his excess. Yet he does not rely on his own ability, as though he had none; he does not claim his own accomplishments, as though he had none; he does not desire to display his ability as superior to others. All of these are acts of diminishing his own excess."*

**Chapter Seventy-Eight**
*"In the world, there is none softer or weaker than water, yet none better at overcoming hardness and strength—nothing can replace it."*

○ *Lü Shi said:*
*"The things of the world vary, yet none surpasses water in its extreme softness and weakness. It levels mountains, erodes stone, clears blockages, overcomes hardness and strength, benefiting all things and entering all things. It follows the dictates of man—whether confined or released—and adapts to the shape of its vessel, whether square or round. It transforms into vapor, into clouds and rain, into frost and snow. Hence, Heaven first generates water, from which springs the ceaseless flow of sources and streams, vast and boundless, though winding a thousand times or turning a million times, it never ceases to be water. This is the embodiment of the marvelous unity of the harmonious qi.*

*Yet in its application to all things, water can be strong or weak, rigid or soft—thus it can overcome all things, approaching the Dao, and nothing can replace it.*

*In the body, there is none softer or weaker than the essence of Hua Tu (华池灵液). The perfected one circulates and directs it, reaching every place. Sometimes they rinse and swallow it to irrigate the five viscera; sometimes they manipulate and transport it to reach the three pass points. Even to the point of permeating the lower back’s aperture (透尾闾), passing the spine’s interstices (过夹脊), flowing upward against the current (泝流直上), and supplementing the brain (而补於脑)—none but the divine water could achieve this."*

○ *He Shi said:*
*"Water can be directed east or west to flow. In the world, there is none more supremely soft and weak than water. It erodes the stone of Tai Mountain (穿太山之石), breaches a thousand-golden floodbank (决千金之堤), and overcomes hardness and strength—this is an unalterable truth from ancient to modern times."*

「○ Lin Shi said: Water is supremely weak yet can overcome hardness and strength—none in the world can rival it. The thousand-golden floodbank (千金之堤) is undone by the leak of an ant’s burrow (蚁穴之漏), thus proving that weakness can triumph over strength, and none can surpass water in this.

Weakness triumphing over strength, softness overcoming hardness—none in the world does not know this, yet none can practice it.

○ Lü Shi said: Water extinguishes fire, yin subdues yang; the tongue is soft yet the teeth are hard, yet when the tongue survives, the teeth perish. None in the world does not know this, yet it is a common saying among the vulgar.

The Dao/Way of Heaven does not contend with things, yet thus overcomes them. Common folk always desire to contend with things, yet few can overcome them.

Indeed, those who know yet cannot practice it cannot achieve their aims in the world; those who know and can practice it may achieve their aims in the world.

○ He Shi said: In the *Liezǐ* (《列子》), it is said that there are unchanging ways of victory and unchanging ways of defeat. The unchanging way of victory is called *softness* (柔), the unchanging way of defeat is called *strength* (强). These two principles are easy to know, yet people do not recognize them. Master Huangshi (黄石公) instructed Zhifang (子房), yet only spoke of *softness overcoming hardness* (柔胜刚) and *weakness overcoming strength* (弱胜强). This is a principle easy to know yet not understood, and even those who know it cannot practice it—only the sage can know and practice it.

○ Lin Shi said: Weakness overcoming strength, softness overcoming hardness—like water, this is plainly visible, yet none in the world can practice it. The supreme Dao/Way lies in those who can be soft and weak, yet none can practice this.

○ Li Shi said: Softness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength—all know this yet none can practice it. Why? Because they refuse to humble themselves. Hence, the sage says:

*"To bear the filth of the state (受国之垢) is to be called its sovereign (社稷主).
To bear the misfortunes of the state (受国之不祥) is to be called the King of the world (天下王).
To speak straight yet reverse the meaning (正言若反)."*

○ Lü Shi said: The sage’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth are supremely vast, encompassing all things great and small, coarse and fine, and their likes and dislikes. The sage is supremely exalted, and all—wise and foolish, noble and ignoble—turn to him for support.

Again, the sage can endure filth and conceal it, tolerate insults and embrace chaos, thus aiding the Dao/Way of *ren* (仁) and *yi* (义), of softness and weakness overcoming strength. Then the people revere his virtue and do not scatter. He can perpetually serve as the sovereign of the state (社稷主).

The sage practices humility and submission, following Heaven’s course. Wars, calamities, droughts, and locust plagues are all the fate of *effort* (劫运), which Heaven sometimes uses to admonish people. If the sage does not lay blame upon others but instead takes it upon himself, then the Four Seas will return to *ren* (仁), and the Six Directions will find their home in his heart. Thus, he can become the King of the world (天下王).

Hence it is said: *"To bear the misfortunes of the state (受国不祥) is to be called the King of the world (天下王)."*

The vulgar regard bearing filth and misfortunes as something to be reviled, yet the sage regards them as something to be rejoiced in. Rejoicing in what others revile may not necessarily bring fortune; reviling what others rejoice in may not necessarily bring disaster.

To speak straight yet reverse the meaning (正言若反)—this is because the vulgar conceal their own faults while exposing others’, whereas the sage acknowledges his own faults while concealing others’. Thus, their words diverge; only the sage’s words are truly upright, hence *"to speak straight yet reverse the meaning."*

○ He Shi said: The term *"orphans, widows, and the destitute"* (孤寡不谷) is used by kings and nobles, all of which reflect the principle of *softness overcoming hardness* (柔胜刚). This is the true principle of the world, yet people do not know or practice it. When they hear the sage speak of *softness overcoming hardness*, they think it contradictory, yet it is truly the correct teaching.

○ Dong Shi said: This chapter states that softness and weakness, when able to contain, become what all things turn to. The seventy-ninth chapter says: *"To reconcile great grievances (和大怨) must leave some remnant grievance; how can this be called a good Dao/Way?"*

○ Lin Shi said: Only when one forgets both恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance) does one know the supreme Dao/Way. If a person harbors great怨 (grievance) against me yet I still desire to reconcile it, though I have no lingering resentment, I still recognize that it is a grievance. Then this heart is not yet transformed.

Though it is said that I can reconcile it, my heart is not yet transformed, so the remnant grievance remains. How can this be called a good Dao/Way? This is indeed a profound statement, yet it is also an analogy.

○ Lü Shi said: Grievances and enmities have already run deep, and the chasm between enemies is already vast. Even if one ultimately concedes what is right and wrong, affirming what is wrong and denying what is right, repays them with virtue, and straightens them with righteousness, how could there ever be no lingering regret?

It is better to forget both恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance), and let the Dao/Way reconcile and transform them. Then the grieved will not need reconciliation before they are already reconciled.

Biqiuzi (碧虚子) said that knowing of a grievance yet reconciling it is not as good as having no grievance to reconcile. If one reconciles and repays grievances with laws and governance, how can this be called a good Dao/Way?

○ Li Shi said: Building upon the previous chapter’s principle of *hardness and softness*, to reconcile with恩 (恩), though grievances may be resolved, the heart remains unchanged. How can this be called a good Dao/Way? It is better to blame oneself and forget both恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance). When恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance) are both forgotten, the people will naturally feel gratitude and respond with loyalty.

Hence, the sage holds the *left contract* (执左契) yet does not demand repayment from others.

○ Lin Shi said: The *left contract* (左契) is like the written agreements of today. One party holds the left half, the other holds the right half, hence the term *left contract*.

If this contract is held by me, then the other party must fulfill their obligations. Though the sage holds this contract, he does not demand repayment from others, but instead forgets and transforms.

○ Lü Shi said: In ancient times, people tied knots in ropes to make agreements, yet the people did not deceive. They split wooden tablets to make contracts, yet the people did not violate them. Thus, the sage harmonized human Dao/Way with Heaven’s Dao/Way, and human heart with Heaven’s heart. Hence, holding the contract on the left (执左契) signifies agreement, and combining it on the right (合之于右) signifies trust. Not demanding repayment from others also corresponds with Heaven’s will. Here, there is no blame; there, there is no fault. Above and below are in harmony, and there is no blame for grievances. Hence it is said: *"The sage holds the left contract yet does not demand repayment from others."*

○ Wu Shi said: *"The sage holds the left contract yet does not demand repayment from others"* means he has no expectations of things.

The *contract* (契) is a wooden tablet split in two, with each party keeping one half to demonstrate sincerity. When one demands repayment of money or goods from another, it is called *responsibility* (责). The contract has left and right halves: the left half is held by the party who gives the money or goods, and the right half is given to the party who comes to take them. Master Lin of Lichuan (临川王氏) said: The *Shiji* (《史记》) states: *"He held the left contract to demand repayment"* (操左契以责事), and the *Liji* (《礼记》) states: *"Those who offer land and residences hold the left contract"* (献田宅者操左契). Thus, it is known that the left half is held by the party who receives responsibility.»

Thus, the virtuous govern through trust, while the unvirtuous demand clarity.

The Dao/Way of Heaven favors none, yet always aids the good.
Master Lin said: The virtuous hold the contract, yet seek nothing in return. The unvirtuous, however, demand only clarity.
*Simply* (彻) means to make clear.
It is like when people today say, *"Let us settle this clearly"* (必与之讨分晓).

Those who govern through virtue are the good—Heaven, without favor, aids such people, hence it is said: *"Heaven always aids the good."*

Master He said: The contract is a binding agreement, like written covenants or pacts.
The virtuous gain the Dao/Way and many allies—like the contract held within, merging without demand. The unvirtuous lose the Dao/Way and have few allies—even if they forcefully demand clarity from others, who would answer them? *Zhuangzi* despised those who sought to force connections—this is the case.

If one truly possesses virtue and morality, why would Heaven alone not aid them? The august Heaven favors none, only virtue does it support. Thus it is said: *"I do not know those who do good, nor those who do evil."* Accumulated goodness attracts benevolent qi; accumulated evil attracts malevolent qi. Accumulated goodness summons divine assistance—Heaven’s Dao/Way naturally aids the good.

Master Li said: The contract is a pledge of trust; *simply* (彻) means to make clear.
The virtuous hold their pledges, while the unvirtuous demand only clarity—knowing only to judge by law, yet unaware that such strictness would leave no people. Those who govern through virtue preserve sincerity, aligning with the people’s hearts.

Master Lü said: The *Classic of Documents* states: *"The august Heaven is impartial, aiding only virtue."* The *I Ching* says: *"Heaven aids them—auspicious, with no misfortune."* Heaven’s Dao/Way never distinguishes between giving or taking; doing good generates benevolent qi, doing evil generates malevolent qi—naturally corresponding.
For the supremely virtuous, harmony arises naturally, favoring only the good—why demand contracts or responsibility from others? This is the way of the ancient past.

**Chapter Eighty: Small States, Few People**
In small states with few people, let there be weapons numbering in tens and hundreds, yet unused. Let the people value life so deeply that they do not wander far.

Master Lin said: Small states with few people—like Mencius’ saying that even a hundred *li* of land could be used to gather lords and unify the world. Laozi meant that those who embody the Dao/Way, if granted even a small state and few people, would govern them simply. Let there be *shí-bǎi* (什伯) formations—like today’s neighborhood watches—where each person has usable skills, yet does not seek personal gain. Thus, all act like gentlemen, content in retreat, valuing life so deeply that they do not wander far. The common people fear doing wrong and remain settled in their homes.

Master He said: Small states with few people are not inferior to vast lands and many subjects. Governing by the Dao/Way means even smallness can illuminate greatness.
*Shí-bǎi* refers to communal tools—according to a Western Han decree prohibiting officials’ residences from storing *shí* (什, ten) items, Preface Master Yan (颜师古) noted: *"Five men form a *wǔ* (伍), ten form a *shí*—sharing tools, hence called *shí-wǔ* equipment, or *shí* goods, like today’s military units where ten form a team, sharing supplies and logistics."* Ten make a *shí*, a hundred make a *bǎi*—calculable numbers. If the people have *shí-bǎi* tools yet do not use them, there is no need for travel or storage, sparing labor and taxes—this is the ideal of *"no affairs where there are none."*

States, whether small or vast in Heaven and Earth, thrive with non-action and falter with interference. If the people once fled lightly for their lives, now that they cherish life, none would stray—who would compel them?

Master Wu said: Ten make a *shí*, a hundred make a *bǎi*—*shí-bǎi* tools are heavy implements shared by many. *"Unused"* means no scheming or greed, so heavy tools serve no purpose. *"Valuing death"* means treating life as precious and nurturing it. *"Not wandering far"* means living and dying in the same place, never relocating. Laozi sought to reverse the decline of the Zhou, restoring the simplicity of antiquity. Since large states with many people are hard to govern, he spoke modestly: if even a small state with few people could be governed thus, the people would have no desire for the outside, content within.

Though there are boats and carriages, they are not used. Though there are armor and weapons, they are not displayed. The people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.

Their food is sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.
Neighboring states are close enough to hear the sounds of roosters and dogs, yet the people die of old age without visiting one another.

Master Lin said: Though there are boats and carriages, they are not used for distant journeys seeking profit. Though there are armor and weapons, they are not displayed for reliance on force to win. Abandoning written contracts, they return to using knotted cords—reverting to primordial simplicity. Sweet food, fine clothing, secure homes, and joyful customs: neighboring states are near, roosters crow and dogs bark, yet the people die of old age without traveling—each self-sufficient, seeking nothing.

Master He said: Boats and carriages serve desires—now that the people have few desires, what need is there to ride them? Armor and weapons are used for conflict—now that the people have no conflicts, why display them? Knotted cords were used before writing—now to revive them is to return to ancient purity. Sweet food and fine clothing come from tilling and weaving—no hunger, no cold. Secure homes and joyful customs: their movements are slow, their awareness serene, content and at ease. Neighboring states are close, roosters crow and dogs bark, yet none go nor come—seeking nothing from the world, they age and die. This flourishing of ancient customs comes from the ancient sage’s governance.

Master Wu said: This speaks of having myriad tools yet not using them. Boats, carriages, armor, and weapons—none are things a single person can employ alone; these are what is meant by "myriad tools." To have nothing to ride upon, nothing to display—this means they are not used. Without need for travel, there is no use for boats and carriages; without strife, there is no use for armor and weapons. When the people are pure and their affairs simple, even the ancient system of knotted cords could be revived. Though writing replaced knotted cords, it too would not be used.

Not only are myriad tools unused, but the food they eat is deemed sweet, the clothing they wear deemed fine—self-sufficient, nurturing life with what they have. This is what is meant by valuing death. They find contentment in their dwellings and joy in their customs—this is to say they do not migrate far. Those who value death will age and die in the place of their birth; who would lightly abandon it for distant lands?

When the people cherish their native soil, even neighboring states—visible to the eye, their roosters crowing and dogs barking audible to the ear—though so near, none go to visit, let alone migrate far.

**Chapter 81**
*"True words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not true.
The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.
The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise."*

Master Lü said: Words of truth are plain and unadorned, like water—water is bland yet enduring. What is not beautiful is because its essence is bitter. Beautiful words are sweet and nourishing, pleasing to the ear, like fine wine—yet wine’s sweetness fades quickly. What is untrue is hollow beneath its ornamentation. Hence, *"True words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not true."*

Those who are truly virtuous value action over eloquence, holding to simplicity. Those skilled in argument prize persuasion, entangled in right and wrong, yet lacking true understanding. Hence, *"The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous."*

Those who grasp the Dao understand principles and penetrate to their roots, seizing the essential—this is to be unified in one, completing all things. Why seek breadth? The broadly learned are versed in things, immersed in affairs, their substance obscured by ornamentation, their minds drowned in multiplicity, seeking only what is right—yet unaware that excess leads to confusion. Hence, *"The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise."*

Master Lin said: True words lack adornment; what is adorned is not true. *The Zhuangzi* conceals itself in splendor, taking broad knowledge as skill, boasting of it—this is not the way of the wise.

Master Li said: *"True words are not beautiful"*—loyal words are harsh to hear. *"Beautiful words are not true"*—flattering speech is deceitful. True words are plain and unadorned; false words are embellished. Those who truly follow the Dao make no distinctions, hence do not argue. Those skilled in argument are the cause of strife. Hence, the truly wise are luminous yet not dazzling, hence not broadly learned. The broadly learned are superficial in sight, hence lack true knowledge.

The Sage does not hoard. The more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one shares, the more one has. Master Lü said: *The Zhuangzi* speaks of the Dao’s movement without accumulation, thus all under heaven revere it. The Sage’s "not hoarding" means spreading virtue for others—those who receive it see their virtue grow ever brighter, like a mirror’s clarity, never diminished. To distribute wealth to the poor: the poor accept the gift, yet the giver’s wealth grows ever fuller, like a wellspring’s clear, unending flow, from which all things draw without depletion. Master Liezi said that giving wealth is the mark of an accomplished person, while sharing virtue is the mark of the Sage—both embody "not hoarding."

Because there is accumulation, there is lack; because there is no hoarding, there is abundance. Hence, *"The Sage does not hoard; the more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one shares, the more one has."*

Master He said: Why does the Sage not hoard? *The Zhuangzi* says the Dao moves without accumulation, thus all things flourish. The Sage acts without hoarding, thus all under heaven revere them. Hence, *"Because there is accumulation, there is lack; because there is no hoarding, there is abundance."* The Sage’s giving to others only increases their own abundance, sharing with others only multiplies their own wealth—whether through virtue or wealth, demonstrating sincerity, doing good for others, accumulating yet dispersing, broadly learned yet transforming—all embody the intent of making the world public.

Master Lin said: The Sage’s Dao is but emptiness and unity—what is there to hoard? They never fail to benefit others, yet their own abundance grows ever greater. They never fail to share with others, yet their own wealth multiplies evermore. It is like the Dao of Heaven: empty yet unyielding, moving yet ever producing. To benefit others and be benefited in return, to speak the Dao and transform things—this is the Dao of Heaven.

*"The Dao of Heaven benefits all without harming.
The Sage’s Dao acts without strife."*

Master Lü said: The Dao of Heaven is the Yang—it loves life and abhors killing, hence is beneficial without harm. Spring and summer nurture growth; autumn and winter bring maturation. In its utter impartiality, it fulfills what is good in people yet does not complete what is evil. It gives benefit to all without inflicting harm. Hence, *"The Dao of Heaven benefits all without harming."*

Heaven speaks not yet responds perfectly, always answering with substance, not with empty words. The Sage embodies this as harmony, establishes it as practice, and applies it—thus aligned with Heaven, in accord with the Sage. This is the *"six penetrations and four openings,"* the root of all things, yet without strife.

Master He said: The Dao of Heaven benefits all without harm; the Sage’s Dao accomplishes all without strife.

The *Yì* says: **"Qián** [the Creative, Heaven] begins with the power to bring beauty and benefit to the world—yet does not speak of what it benefits. How vast it is! The primal essence of Qián is firm and strong, balanced and upright, a pure and refined concentration of *qi*. Clouds move, rain falls—all things are at peace.**

The Sage who embodies Qián [the Creative] fulfills the Dao completely and brings beauty to all. With boundless generosity, he aids and rescues the people, accomplishing much yet never striving—all from the wondrous application of the Qián essence.

In the final chapter of *Lǎozǐ* [Laozi], the first words are removed, then the Sage and the people are discussed, finally aligning with the Dao of Heaven and the Sage. Their functions are thus fully expressed—is this not already complete?

To know *Yì* [the *Yijing*] is to know *Lǎozǐ* [Laozi].

○ **Lín Shì** said: The Dao of Heaven, though it brings beauty and benefit without speaking of what it benefits, is seen only as beneficial and without harm. If one speaks of its benefiting, then harm also becomes apparent. The Sage’s Dao is effortless yet accomplishes all, yet he never relies on his own power—thus he does not contend with things, yet the world cannot contend with him.

The essence of this text is largely centered on *non-contention*—hence it concludes with these words.

○ **Lǐ Shì** said: The greatest *virtue/power* of Heaven and Earth is *generation*—hence it is said, *"benefit without harm."* The Sage upholds his station with *rén* [benevolence/heart-mind]—hence it is said, *"accomplish without contention."*

If one practices the principle of *non-contention* in daily life, over time and with purity, one will naturally attain the realm of *Hùn Yuán* [the Primordial Chaos], the *true constant Dao*, and reach its utmost perfection. This is the foundation of the *Emperor’s* [the Sage’s] first manifestation, the source of profound clarity—it is achieved.

The *True Scripture of the Dao and Virtue* [the *Daodejing*] concludes its compilation of meaning in the tenth volume.
