**The *Zhǐguī of the Dàodé Zhēn Jīng*
Composed by Yán Zhūn of Shǔ Commandery (style name Jūn Píng), with annotations by Gǔshénzǐ.**

In ancient times, when Lǎozǐ composed the *Dàodé Jīng*,
His original intent was to trace the form and refine the *qi*,
Ascending to the divine and luminous.
Where life and nature first emerge,
Where emotions and intentions take root,
Where advance and retreat, response and influence unfold,
Where breath and movement bend and stretch—
He aligned these with Heaven and Earth,
Examined them through Yin and Yang,
Unfolding transformations from beginning to end,
Where all things find their place.
He penetrated the subtle and reached the profound,
To perceive the natural order.

Condensing the essentials and extending the categories,
He recorded two *jīng* scrolls,
Articulating Heaven’s intent,
Revealing Earth’s heart,
To govern the realm,
To nurture all things and the people.

Each chapter has its inner and outer layers,
Unchangeable in their order.
When a chapter is complete, its structure is whole—
Like a root and its stem.
The words follow one another in sequence,
Neither above nor below can be altered.
Widely spreading the Dao and virtue,
Like the dragon and the *lín* [unicorn].

Add a single character, and it becomes a wart or excrescence;
Subtract a single word, and it becomes a scar or ulcer.
Thus, "great" precedes "small"—this is the highest principle.
To record the Dao and expound virtue is called a *jīng*.

At its beginning, "upper virtue does not virtue,"
For transformation arises from the Dao,
Yet the Dao does not claim dominion over it.
Hence, he entrusted it to the "one of old times."

「In ancient times, the *One* [得一] was attained—
Its movement stems from *contrary action* [反行],
And only those of high innate nature can truly perceive it,
Thus it was entrusted to the *superior sage* [上士].

The *superior sage* has lofty and keen insight,
Deep and distant understanding alone,
Disdaining the world and holding all things lightly,
He bears only the *Dao* [道] on his shoulders,
Thus it was entrusted to *Dao generating the One* [道生一].

*Dao generating the One* is supreme emptiness without name,
Receiving the primal *hun* [混冥],
Refining the clear and the turbid,
Molding the *Great Harmony* [太和],
Thus it was entrusted to *the utmost softness under heaven* [天下至柔].

*The utmost softness under heaven* is subtle and formless,
Piercing the firm and penetrating the distant,
Conquering all without defeat,
Thus it was entrusted to *possessing named wealth and goods* [身有名货].

To possess named wealth and goods brings strength and power,
Yet strength and power invite calamity,
Thus it was entrusted to *Great Completion* [大成].

*Great Completion* is like emptiness,
Void of named wealth and goods,
All things harmonize and communicate,
Thus it was entrusted to *the world with the Dao* [天下有道].

*The world with the Dao* rests with the sovereign,
The sovereign without desire sees all things preserved,
Thus it was entrusted to *not stepping outside the door* [不出户].

By not stepping outside the door, one knows the life and fate of all the people,
Receiving them in harmony and resting in ease,
Thus it was entrusted to *daily learning brings increase* [为学日益].

To daily learn brings increase,
Yet words arise and affairs multiply, exhausting the spirit and harming the people,
Thus it was entrusted to *the Sage has no mind* [圣人无心].

*The Sage has no mind*,
Uniting with the people’s *shen* [神],
Cautiously preserving their life and fate,
Returning to the primal *zhen* [素真],
Thus it was entrusted to *born and enter death* [出生入死].

To be born and enter death,
Every movement depletes the spirit,
Discarding the non-returning for the returning,
Cannot long endure,
Thus it was entrusted to *Dao generating life* [道生之].

*Dao generating life* is through emptiness and nothingness,
Where all things are preserved,
Silent and still, unmoving,
Nothing it refuses,
Thus it was entrusted to *the world has a beginning* [天下有始].

*The world has a beginning*,
Non-action as its core,
To penetrate all affairs without confusion,
To know all without limitation,
Thus it was entrusted to *let me have knowledge* [使我有知].

*Let me have knowledge*,
The *Dao* refined and practiced,
Fear of losing the natural order,
Bringing ruin to descendants,
Thus it was entrusted to *good foundation* [善建].

To *good foundation* with virtue,
Connecting with all things,
Blessing future generations,
Flowing to the ends and flourishing,
Thus it was entrusted to *the virtuous sage* [含德之士].

*The virtuous sage*,
Embodied in the *Dao* and walking in the *shen* [神],
Like an infant—innocent and unknowing,
Thus it was entrusted to *the knowing do not speak* [知者不言].

*The knowing do not speak*,
The *yīnyáng* [阴阳] subtly transform,
Internally rectifying the self,
The self extending to the family,
The family extending to the people,
Thus it was entrusted to *govern the realm* [政治国].

To govern with rectitude,
Without decrees yet all things move,
Foreign lands and customs come without command,
Thus it was entrusted to *square yet not cutting* [方而不割].

*Square yet not cutting*,
All things preserved whole,
Conquering all without defeat,
The *Dao* of heaven shines great,
Thus it was entrusted to *rule the great realm* [治大国].

The ruler of the great realm must not act greatly nor do greatly,
Great actions and deeds bring great disorder and turmoil—then ruin,
Thus it was entrusted to *the great realm* [大国].

*The great realm* is naturally advantageous,
All under heaven desire it,
Calmness below brings return,
Frenzy above breeds war,
Thus it was entrusted to *harmonizing with things* [道物].

*Harmonizing with things* is firm and steady,
Those who attain it are enlightened,
Those who treasure it are preserved,
Those who guard it are profound,
Thus it was entrusted to *non-action* [为无为].

*Non-action* makes the transformations effortless,
Things flourish unseen—yet all things grow,
Thus it was entrusted to *its ease in holding* [其安易持].

Before signs appear, plans are easy,
Holding to it like the simple,
No visible affairs yet all calamities vanish,
All blessings come naturally,
Thus it was entrusted to *the ancient Way* [古之为道].

*The ancient Way* is to keep the people simple,
Cutting off extremes and eradicating roots,
Sealing the gates of knowledge,
Thus it was entrusted to *the rivers and seas* [江海].

*The rivers and seas* know no limits,
Empty and tranquil, dwelling in the lowly,
To receive all the valleys,
Thus it was entrusted to *the world calls me greatly unlike* [天下谓我大似不肖].

*The unlike* Way uniquely aligns with heaven’s heart,
Raising armies and moving the people,
Invincible and undefeated,
Thus it was entrusted to *the use of arms* [用兵].

*The use of arms* follows heaven’s patterns and responds to human needs,
Arising from its root,
Not from my own will,
Thus it was entrusted to *my words are easily known* [吾言易知].

*My words are easily known*,
Without wisdom or understanding,
Without speech or affairs,
Letting things act naturally,
Thus it was entrusted to *knowing the unknown* [知不知].

*Knowing the unknown*,
Discarding the mind and discarding intent,
Born yet like death,
Preserved yet like loss,
Abandoning my clever artifices,
To pursue calamity and misfortune,
Thus it was entrusted to *the people do not fear authority* [民不畏威].

*The people do not fear authority*,
Lightly shunning prohibitions and easily entering,
Trapped in officialdom,
Their great fate severed from heaven,
Thus it was entrusted to *daring to be bold* [勇於敢].

*Daring to be bold* stirs the heart of the thief,
Taking life and losing principle,
The law decays and the state perishes,
Thus it was entrusted to *the people do not fear death* [民不畏死].

*The people do not fear death*,
Desires unchecked and prohibitions ignored,
Following their emotions and inclinations,
To reach poverty and destitution,
Thus it was entrusted to *the people’s hunger* [人之饥也].

*The people’s hunger*,
Heavy taxes and excessive levies,
Greed for plunder, ceaseless scheming,
Harshness and rigidity, seizing life,
Thus it was entrusted to *the people’s life* [人之生也].

*The people’s life*,
Soft and weak yet fearing reverence,
Harmonious and pure, subtle and refined,
Keen and bright with daily learning,
In death, they become harsh and rigid,
Thus it was entrusted to *the Way of heaven* [天之道].

*The Way of heaven* diminishes fullness and supplements emptiness,
Nurtures the soft and compliant,
Overthrows the firm and shatters the rigid,
Thus it was entrusted to *nothing under heaven is softer and weaker than water* [天下莫柔弱於水].

*Water*, though soft and weak,
Can overcome the firm and strong,
Resting in the subtle and delighting in the small,
In peril it finds its ease,
Thus it was entrusted to *the small realm* [小国].

*The small realm*’s sovereign,
Form is empty, power is weak,
Life depends on neighbors,
Thus it was entrusted to *the trustworthy* [信者].

*The trustworthy* are aided by all the people,
And preserved by ministers and generals,
Heavened by earth and sky,
And assisted by the *Dao* and virtue.

Zhuangzi said: In the past, when Laozi composed the *Jīng* [经],
He recorded the principles of transformation,
*Dao* and *virtue* as its mother,
The *Jīng* listed first,
Heaven and earth as its model.

The *upper jīng* corresponds to heaven,
The *lower jīng* corresponds to earth.
Eight chapters for the *yin* Way,
Nine chapters for the *yang* Way,
Using *yin* to follow *yang*,
Thus seventy-two chapters.
Beginning with *yang* to follow *yin*,
Thus divided into upper and lower.
With eight chapters for the five *xíng* [行],
Thus the upper *jīng* has forty chapters before it begins anew.»

「With four *xíng* [行] and eight chapters,
Thus the lower *jīng* [经] has thirty-two chapters before it concludes.

The *yang* Way is odd, the *yin* Way even,
Hence the upper *jīng* precedes and the lower *jīng* follows;
The *yang* Way is vast, the *yin* Way confined,
Thus the upper *jīng* contains many, the lower few;
The *yang* Way moves leftward, the *yin* Way rightward,
So the upper *jīng* follows in succession, the lower reverses its course.

In reverse and succession, they intermingle as one form,
In profound obscurity, they merge into chaos—
The *Dao* [道] as their central sovereign,
With repeated seals and verifications to reveal their threads.

The lower *jīng* is the door,
The upper *jīng* is the frame.

The wise discern its efficacy in the *jīng*,
And thus grasp the numbers of heaven and earth,
The cycles of *yin* and *yang*,
The pairing of husband and wife,
The bond of parent and child,
The rites of lord and subject—
And all things unfold in harmony.

**Yán Jūn Píng** [严君平] of the **Zhuāng** [庄] clan spoke of the *jīng* titles—
He was a native of **Chéngdū** [成都], in the commandery of **Shǔ** [蜀],
And since his surname was **Zhuāng** [庄], he was thus called **Zhuāngzi** [庄子].

During the **Chānghé** [章和] era of the **Eastern Hàn** [东汉],
**Bān Gōng** [班固] composed the *Hànshū* [汉书],
But to avoid the taboo of Emperor **Míng** [明], he altered it to **Yán** [严];
Both **Zhuāng** [庄] and **Yán** [严] were common terms in ancient and modern times.

**Jūn Píng** [君平] was born in the middle of the **Western Hàn** [西汉],
When **Wáng Mǎng** [王莽] usurped the throne,
He withdrew into seclusion during the **Yǒnghé** [炀和] era,
Truly a **zhēnrén** [真人] of the ancient age.

The *Moral Dao/Way True Classic* [道德真经] *Zhǐguī* [指归] consists of volumes one to six (missing),
The *Moral Dao/Way True Classic* [道德真经] *Zhǐguī* [指归] volume seven.

The **Commandery of Shǔ** [蜀郡] **Yán Zūn** [严遵], styled **Jūn Píng** [君平], compiled the *Gǔshénzǐ Zhù* [谷神子注].

The **uppermost virtue/power** [上德] does not **virtue/power** [德] (Chapter#1).
The **uppermost virtue/power** [上德] does not **virtue/power** [德], its virtue/power is **mysterious** [玄]—
Thus, it is said that he who has virtue/power, **virtues/powers** [德] without return.
The **lowest virtue/power** [下德] does not lose virtue/power—
Its virtue/power is **heard** [可闻], thus it is said that he who lacks virtue/power, **virtues/powers** [德] **recur upon the self** [反身].

The **uppermost virtue/power** [上德] acts without **doing** [为], and all things follow **naturally** [自然]—
Yet nothing is left undone; its merit is **ascribed to Heaven** [归天].
The **lowest virtue/power** [下德] **does** [为]—
Yet it exhausts the **spirit** [精神], and its merit is **ascribed to man** [归人].

The **uppermost benevolence** [上仁] **does** [为]—
Yet it adds **favor and love** [恩爱], and does not **do** [为] as the **ascetic** [禅] of the **sages and worthies** [圣贤].
The **uppermost righteousness** [上义] **does** [为]—
Yet it establishes **order and limits** [有民] for the people, and its merit is **transmitted to descendants** [传子孙].
The **uppermost propriety** [上礼] **does** [为]—
Yet it **regulates rites and origins** [节事原], and none respond—
It loses the **people’s hearts** [人心], then **rolls up one’s sleeves** [攘臂] and **enforces harmony and kinship** [强和亲].
Thus, when the **Dao/Way** is lost, the **virtue/power** [德] **name** [名] first **sprouts** [萌].
When **virtue/power** [德] is lost, **benevolence and love** [仁爱] **take form** [形].
When **benevolence and love** [仁] is lost, **righteous distinctions** [义分] and **roles** [职] become **clear** [明].
When **righteousness** [义] is lost, **rites and jade offerings** [礼玉帛] are **performed** [行].
**Rites** [礼], then, are the **thin outer layer of loyalty and trust** [忠信之薄], the **waning of virtue/power** [衰亡].
They are the **beginning of disorder** [乱之首], the **gateway to craft and deceit** [巧伪门].
**Preassigned roles** [前职] are **thus established** [预设然], yet **the Dao/Way’s refinement** [道之华化] has not yet **been heard** [闻].
They mark the **beginning of foolishness** [愚之始] and the **source of confusion** [惑乱根].
Thus, the **true man** [大丈夫] **embodies the Dao/Way** [体道] and **rules** [君].
He **dwells in its substance** [处其厚], **embracing loyalty and trust** [含忠信].
He does not **dwell in its thinness** [不处其薄], **abandoning rites** [去礼].
He **dwells in its reality** [处其实], **moving with cause** [动有因].
He does not **dwell in its refinement** [不处其华], **avoiding premature knowledge** [不前识].
He **seeks this and discards that** [去彼取此], **pursuing it within himself** [求诸身].

**Zhǐguī** [指归]:
The **origin** [所由] of **Heaven and Earth** [天地],
The **source** [所以] of **all things** [物类],
The **Dao/Way** [道] is its **root** [元],
**Virtue/power** [德] is its **beginning** [始],
**Divine clarity** [神明] is its **core** [宗],
**Great Harmony** [太和] is its **ancestor** [祖].
The **Dao/Way** [道] has **depth and subtlety** [深微],
**Virtue/power** [德] has **thickness and thinness** [厚薄],
**Divine essence** [神] has **purity and turbidity** [清浊],
**Harmony** [和] has **height and depth** [高下].
The **pure** [清] is **Heaven** [天], the **turbid** [浊] is **Earth** [地],
The **yang** [阳] is **male** [男], the **yin** [阴] is **female** [女].
**Humans and things** [人物] **borrow and receive** [禀假],
Their **endowment** [受] has **much and little** [多少],
Their **nature** [性] has **refinement and coarseness** [精粗],
Their **fate** [命] has **length and brevity** [长短],
Their **emotions** [情] have **beauty and ugliness** [美恶],
Their **intentions** [意] have **greatness and smallness** [大小].
Some become **petty men** [小人], some become **gentlemen** [君子].
Their **transformations** [变化] and **separations** [分离]
Are **divided and judged** [剖判] by **categories** [数等].
Thus there are **Dao/Way men** [道人], **virtue/power men** [德人],
**benevolent men** [仁人], **righteous men** [义人], **proper men** [礼人].

Dare I ask: What **actions** [行] does that **man** [彼人] take
To earn such **contradictory titles** [殊谬名号] as these?
**Zhuāngzi** [庄子] said:
**Emptiness and non-action** [虚无无为], **opening and guiding** [开导] all things—
This is called the **Dao/Way man** [道人].
**Purity and stillness** [清静], **responding naturally** [因应], yet **doing nothing** [无所不为]—
This is called the **virtue/power man** [德人].
**Compassionate love for all things** [兼爱], **boundless universal application** [博施无穷]—
This is called the **benevolent man** [仁人].
**Rightly ordering names and realities** [理名正实], **acting with righteousness** [处事之义]—
This is called the **righteous man** [义人].
**Modesty and withdrawal** [谦退], **words and yielding** [辞让], **respectfully guarding harmony** [敬以守和]—
This is called the **proper man** [礼人].

All these five types **seek longevity** [乐长生], **revere virtue/power’s thickness** [尊厚德], **value high renown** [贵高名].
Each **cautiously refines his emotions and nature** [慎其情性],
**Trusts in his innate wisdom** [任其聪明],
**Follows his strengths** [道其所长],
**Returns to his ease** [归其所安].
Their **endeavors and pursuits** [趋务] **diverge and scatter** [舛驰],
Some **negate** [否], some **affirm** [然],
Their **transformations** [变化] **differ in direction** [殊方],
Their **titles** [建号] **vary endlessly** [万差].

**Virtue/power** [德] has **superiority and inferiority** [优劣],
The **world** [世] has **prosperity and decline** [盛衰],
**Winds and customs** [风离] **drift apart** [俗异],
**People’s fates** [民命] **differ** [不同].
Thus some **drift boundless and profound** [溟涬玄寥] yet **lack a name** [无名],
Some **are enveloped in dim radiance** [蒙澒芒芒] yet are called **Emperor** [皇],
Some **are vast and overflowing** [汪然漭泛] yet are called **Sovereign** [帝],
Some **are bright and expansive** [廓然昭昭] yet are called **King** [王],
Some **are distant yet harmoniously varied** [远通参差] yet are called **Lord** [伯].
These are the **names that can be spoken** [可言者].

Yet **Lord** [伯] is not **Lord** [伯],
**King** [王] is not **King** [王],
**Sovereign** [帝] is not **Sovereign** [帝],
**Emperor** [皇] is not **Emperor** [皇],
**Being** [有] is not **Being** [有],
**Non-being** [无] is not **Non-being** [无].
**Ten thousand transformations** [千变], **ten thousand variations** [万化]—
They cannot be **reckoned** [为计].
**Layer upon layer, countless eons** [重累亿万]—
They cannot be **named** [为名].

How then can one **clarify** [明] this?
When **one changes a dynasty and becomes King** [易姓而王], **sealing at Tàishān** [封於太山], **ascending at Liángfù** [禅於梁父]—
There are **seventy-two instances** [七十有二] of this.
Yet some **have signs and portents** [形兆] **so indistinct** [圻堮仿髴] as to be **unrecognizable** [不可识]—
They cannot be **spoken of** [称言].
Are these not cases where **nature and fate differ** [性命不同], **merits and titles do not align** [功名不齐]?
No, this is not so.

Thus, the **ruler of uppermost virtue/power** [上德之君]
**embodies the Dao/Way** [体道] and **preserves** [存],
His **divine essence** [神] **harmonizes with transformation** [与化伦],
His **virtue/power** [德] **moves the mysterious depths** [动玄冥].
He **rules the world** [天下王], yet **none witness or hear** [莫有见闻].
His **virtue/power** [德] **returns to all things** [归万物],
And all say it is **natural** [自然].
The **uppermost virtue/power** [上德] does not **virtue/power** [德]—
It **aligns with the Dao/Way** [与道同].

The **ruler of lowest virtue/power** [下德之君]
**embodies virtue/power** [体德] and **acts** [行],
His **divine essence** [神] **wanders with transformation** [与化游],
His **virtue/power** [德] **matches Heaven’s grandeur** [配皇天].
He **rules the world** [天下王], yet some **see or hear** [或见或闻],
His **virtue/power** [德] **flows to all things** [流万物],
Then **recurs upon his ruler** [复反其君].
The **lowest virtue/power** [下德] does not lose virtue/power—
It **virtues/powers** [德德] itself.

Why is this so?
The **ruler of uppermost virtue/power** [上德之君]
**receives in nature** [性受] the **Dao/Way’s subtle intricacies** [道之纤妙],
His **fate** [命] **obtains the One’s refined essence** [一之精微].
His **nature and fate** [性命] **harmonize with nature** [同於自然],
His **emotions and intentions** [情意] **embody divine clarity** [体於神明],
His **actions** [动作] **align with Great Harmony** [伦於太和],
His **taking and discarding** [取舍] **conforms to Heaven’s will** [合乎天心].
His **divine essence** [神] **thinks of nothing** [无所思],
His **will** [志] **worries about nothing** [无所虑],
His **wisdom and clarity** [聪明] are **mysteriously distant** [玄远],
His **stillness** [寂] is **emptily void** [泊空虚].
His **movements** [动] are **formless** [若无形],
His **stillness** [静] is **as yet unborn** [若未生],
His **merits** [功] are **like Heaven and Earth** [若天地],
His **deeds** [事] are **as a babe’s brother** [如婴兄].
He **abandons form** [遗形] and **hides his will** [藏志],
**Aligns with the Dao/Way** [与道相得],
**Boundless and profound** [溟涬], **enveloped in dim radiance** [蒙澒].
**None in the world know him** [天下莫知],
**He drifts beyond the four directions** [潼溶方外],
**Soaring to the utmost distance** [翱翔至远].
**Yin and yang** [阴阳] **serve as his ministers** [为使],
**Ghosts and spirits** [鬼神] **plot his counsel** [为谋].
His **body** [身] **transforms with the Dao/Way** [与道变],
**Above and below are endless** [上下无穷].
He **advances and retreats** [进退], **shifts and adjusts** [推移],
**Ever accompanying transformation** [常与化俱].

Thus, **serene and effortless** [恬淡无为],
His **virtue/power** [德] **overflows the mysterious realm** [德盈于玄域].
**Silent and profound** [玄默], **still and boundless** [寥],
His **transformation** [化] **flows to the limitless** [流於无极].
His **favor** [恩] is **incalculable** [不可量],
His **virtue/power’s thickness** [厚] is **unfathomable** [不可测].
He **encompasses all** [兼包大营],
His **benevolence reaches ten thousand lands** [泽及万国].
His **wisdom is insufficient** [知不足] to **match his transformation** [伦其化],
His **words are insufficient** [言不足] to **guide the customs** [导其俗].
**All under Heaven** [天下] **chatter and murmur** [咮咮喁喁],
Yet all **receive his transformation** [蒙其化] and **are enveloped in his harmony** [被其和].

If such a one **originates from nothing** [元无],
**He vanishes and none know who made him so** [绝而不知为之者何谁].

This is called the **uppermost virtue/power** [上德] **does nothing yet nothing is left undone** [无为而无以为].

The **ruler of lowest virtue/power** [下德之君]
**Receives in nature** [性受] the **Dao/Way’s righteous breath** [道之正气],
His **fate** [命] **obtains the One’s middle-lower essence** [一之下中].
His **nature and fate** [性命] **compare with nature** [比於自然],
His **emotions and intentions** [情意] **approach divine clarity** [几於神明],
His **actions** [动作] **nearly align with Great Harmony** [近於太和],
His **taking and discarding** [取舍] **embody utmost virtue/power** [体於至德].
He **entrusts his divine essence** [托神] to the **Great Void** [太虚],
**Hides his roots** [隐根] in the **mysterious depths** [玄冥].
His **movements** [动] **return to softness and weakness** [反柔弱],
His **stillness** [静] **returns to peace and harmony** [归和平].
He **loads the compass and measures with the square** [载规履矩],
**Gazes into the utmost purity** [镜视太清].
His **transformations** [变化] are **dim and indistinct** [惚恍],
His **responses** [因应] are **formless** [无形],
His **refinement** [希夷] is **vague and obscure** [茫昧].
He **barely has posthumous titles** [几无号谥],
**Measures the earth** [方地] **to follow Heaven** [随天],
**And transformation is his constant** [与化为常].
His **virtue/power

The **unformed virtue** shines unseen,
The world in childlike innocence,
The four seas as one,
Vast and silent, profound and still.
With the people in harmony, gazing together,
With all things in mutual regard.

At such times, the **Great Dao** remains undivided,
The **pure virtue** unsplit.
Within the six extremes, one alone exists.

His **endeavors** are in **subtraction, not addition**,
His **actions** refined, yet **unforced**.
What he does is few,
What he upholds is strict.
The people are sincere and loyal,
The age harmonious and tranquil, serene and unadorned.

Water and grass suffice as stores,
Fur garments as fine attire,
Great trees as halls,
Caves as dwellings.

The ruler stands like Heaven and Earth,
The people like grass and wood,
**Enveloped by Dao, united in virtue**,
**Serene and undemanding**,
Yin and yang in perfect accord,
All things flourishing and multiplying,
No decrees issued,
The world in peaceful submission.
Fine millet and red grasses grow spontaneously,
Sacred dragons and phoenixes dwell among them,
Sweet dew descends without ceasing,
Auspicious winds stir without pause.

Without **righteousness or benevolence**,
Within the six extremes, **harmony with Heaven’s kinship**;
Without **rites or sacrifices**,
Within the four seas, **all are kin as brothers**.

**Kin yet not harmonious**,
**Respectful yet not reverent**,
Heaven, Earth, and all things—
**Mingled in primordial unity**.

The **lower virtue** acts yet **has means**.

The **Supreme Benevolent Ruler**,
His nature pure and luminous,
Bright and far-reaching.
Mind and intent **empty and still**,
Spirit and qi **harmonious and yielding**,
Commanding Heaven and Earth without exclusion.
**Perceiving the subtle, grasping the essential**,
**Knowing the known while embracing the unknown**,
Nurturing life through virtue,
Loving the people as his children.

**Manifesting all things, responding to change**,
Echoing and shadowing in accord,
Marking Heaven’s divisions,
Clarifying Earth’s principles,
Distinguishing the proper roles of all things,
Opening the gate of **understanding past and present**.
**Creating blessings for all**, to benefit the myriad people,
**Recording the inner while overlooking the outer**,
Guiding them with **affection**,
**Accumulating thought and depth**,
To attract the distant lands.

**Laws and prohibitions** are **balanced and gentle**,
**Edicts and commands** **broad and yielding**,
**Actions and measures** **timed with the seasons**,
The world rejoices.
Thunder and lightning do not rage violently,
Winds and rains do not rise abruptly,
Grasses and trees do not wither and decay,
The people do not die young.
**Even the crawling and creeping** all find their place.
The aged and weak wander freely,
The strong till and weave,
Each has descendants to the fourth generation,
Gray-haired elders and children abound,
The ruler as parent, the people as children,
Virtue flows to the four seas,
Yet he **holds nothing**.

The **Supreme Benevolent** acts yet **has no means**.

The **Supreme Righteous Ruler**,
His nature **balanced and just**,
Emotionally **open and discerning**,
Investigating harm and benefit,
**Discerning and wise**, his heart like a **compass and square**,
His will like a **measuring rod**,
**Serene as water**, **straight as a plumb line**.
Delighting in great deeds to **establish his fame**,
Taking pleasure in **beginning blessings**,
Avoiding **precursors to calamity**.
**Wielding authority and transformation** to **govern the age**,
**Exalting benevolence and righteousness** to **oversee the people**.
Following **Heaven and Earth’s principles**,
Regulating **all things’ proper order**,
Serving parents as **revering the divine**,
Treading upon the people as **walking on deep waters**.
**Listening broadly to all nations**,
**Judging with moderation**,
**Awe-inspiring yet not tyrannical**,

**Stern yet not cruel**,
**Discerning yet not harsh**,
**Rooting in origins, determining ends**,
**Establishing posture to govern the people**.
**Advancing and retreating with the times**,
**Flexing and yielding with transformation**,
**Actions and duties shift with change**,
**Rites and customs evolve**.
**Edicts are trustworthy and clear**,
**Laws distinct yet not excessive**,
**All matters decided by ministers below**,
**Authority and power solely with the ruler**.
**The court upholds the Dao with caution**,
**Exalting virtue to expose deceit**,
**Enacting the five punishments**, marking the flesh.
**Honoring origins, valuing beginnings**,
**Adjusting according to norms**,
**Conforming to principle in severance**.
**Authority arises, power expands**,
**Awe shakes the land**,
**Setting aside self for others**,
**Benefiting the people without harshness**,
**Dismissing even the slightest offenses**,
**Exalting the finest virtues**.
**Internally benefiting the royal house**,
**Externally encompassing all things**,
**Addressing decay through transformation**,
**Preserving life and reviving the lost**,
**Supporting the weak and raising the young**,
**Benevolence renewed**,
**Land passed to heirs**,
**Descendants unbroken**.

The **Supreme Righteous** acts yet **has means**.

The **Supreme Riteful Ruler**,
His nature **harmonious yet yielding**,
His heart **detached yet desiring**,
His actions **governed by yin and yang**,
His edicts **aligned with the seasons**,
His **institutions vast and varied**,
His **nets encompassing hearts**,
**Honoring and elevating rulers and parents**,
**Humbling and diminishing ministers and children**.
**Rectifying superior and inferior**,
**Clarifying distinctions**,
**Ordering elder and younger**,
**Differentiating husband and wife**,
**Uniting human relationships**,
**Regulating friendships**.
**Returning to proper offerings and rituals**,
**Matters ranked by category**,
**Those bound by rules are praised**,
**The unrestrained are diminished**.
**Encouraging the strong and suppressing the violent**,
**Encompassing customs with moderation**,
**Guiding through the middle path**,
**Yielding to desires while restraining them**.
**Pressing emotions to curb nature**,
**Damming floods before they rise**,
**Guiding the age and customs**,
**Preventing excess**.
**Severing what others cannot**,
**Forcing what others cannot do**,
**Exhausting spirit and harming nature**,
**Burdening the people with labor and complexity**,
**Order arising from chaos**,
**Safety from danger**.
**Knowledge of past and present is thorough**,
**Pure essence fades away**,
**The Great Dao extinguished**,
**Benevolence does not flourish**,
**Heaven’s harmony disrupted**,
**The four cardinal virtues lost**,
**Thunder and lightning shattered**,
**All things wither and perish**.
When a father or son dies,
The world **remains unchanged**.
When bells and chimes resound,
Customs **do not shift**.
When **elegant melodies** play,
The winds **do not alter**.
**Modesty and withdrawal** meet **disbelief**,
**Yielding and submission** meet **indifference**.
**Offering high rank and rewards**,
The worthy **do not descend**.
**Extending arms to hold the jade scepter**,
The virtuous **do not come**.

The **Supreme Riteful** acts yet **none respond**.

Why is this so?
Though **words are abundant and appearance splendid**,
**Sincerity does not reach the heart**.

Thus, the **foundation of emperors and kings**,
**Dao is the primordial origin**.
When **Dao is lost, virtue takes its place**,
When **virtue is lost, benevolence takes its place**,
When **benevolence is lost, righteousness takes its place**,
When **righteousness is lost, rites take its place**,
When **rites are lost, chaos takes its place**.

These five stages—
**Dao governs as one body**,
Yet **each age’s ruler** has its strengths and weaknesses.

Thus, what is done is not what one truly desires,
What is sought is not what one truly obtains—
They neglect the natural way and instead pursue petty trifles.

Now, the practice of rites,
Though outwardly refined and inwardly discordant,
Though splendid in appearance yet hollow in substance,
Though elaborate in form yet decaying at its root—
When rites grow thin, loyalty is neglected;
When authority is light, threats lose their weight;
When trust fails to reach righteousness,
When virtue does not encompass benevolence,
Then governance becomes superficial,
And chaos becomes the origin.
Deceit and falsehood arise,
And disputes spring from resentment.

Therefore, rites and music are established,
Calendars and garments are reformed,
Proper conduct in advance and retreat is prescribed,
Every action follows fixed norms,
Anticipating events to discern gain and loss.
Yet these are but the outward flourishing of Dao,
The superficial aspects of virtue—
Temporary laws, partial techniques—
Not suited to govern an endless age
Or harmonize diverse customs.

Thus, the roots of calamity and confusion lie here,
The beginning of folly and delusion lies here.
What is called foresight—
The outward adornment of Dao,
The first step toward ignorance.

How may this be made clear?
Zhuangzi said:
*"The response of Heaven and Earth follows events,
And events respond to change.
Change has no fixed time,
Thus actions cannot be predetermined,
Nor can change be preordained—
Just as pain cannot be pre-moistened,
Nor itching pre-broken,
Five flavors cannot be measured by bushels,
Nor zithers tuned by inches.*

Rites are suited to their time;
When time shifts, rites must diverge.
To impose the rites of one era
Upon an endless custom—
It is like gluing a pillar to a boat,
Or tuning a zither while holding a ruler—
Thus, it cannot endure the long term.

Therefore, the most subtle subtlety cannot be spoken,
The most wondrous wonder cannot be transmitted.
Perfect loyalty and trust
Cannot be adorned by rites;
Timely harmony and precedence
Cannot be preserved by calculation.

Thus, the keenly insightful and broadly learned,
With wisdom arising from all directions,
Perceive the threads of yin,
Grasp the patterns of yang,
Understand the Dao of spirits and gods,
Comprehend the principles of all things.
Gazing upward, they see Heaven’s embrace;
Gazing downward, they see Earth’s embrace.
Teaching the people without ceasing,
Acting without end—
Yet achieving balance through this—
Is not what is heard.

To speak of deliberate knowledge is not the method for attaining Great Peace.

Compare the trust of all things in their ruler
To the dwelling of the divine in the body,
Or court well-water in the courtyard.
Water cannot be *made* clear by force,
The divine cannot be *thought* into tranquility.
Between Heaven and Earth, all things flourish together—
Not by artificial means can peace be achieved.
Thus, the noble transformation of the great person
Embodies Dao and embraces virtue,
Pierces the boundless void with clarity,
Completes yet seems incomplete,
Possesses yet seems lacking—
In stillness, formless;
In motion, soundless.
Loyal and trustworthy, yet unassuming,
Ignoring the trappings of authority,
Doing nothing yet achieving all,
Like dragon or serpent.

Rejecting rites and abandoning righteousness,
Returning to the state of non-action;
Adapting to the times and responding to change,
Without pre-set rules.
Holding the subtle and grasping the essential,
Moving with the times;
Flexing and yielding in harmony,
Surviving with change.
Calamity and blame arise from within;
A hundred blessings and myriad fortunes
Are unattached to others.

Abandon that, embrace this.
Obtain the Chapter.

The ancient ones who attained the One
Used it as a foundation for life.
The heavens, attaining the One,
Manifest purity, vigor, and rectitude.
The earth, attaining the One,
Finds tranquility, compliance, and right alignment.
The spirit, attaining the One,
Becomes luminous, responsive, and all-pervasive.
The valleys, attaining the One,
Overflow with boundless abundance.
Lords and kings, attaining the One,
Bring harmony and righteous governance to all under heaven.

The means by which this is achieved
Is the cessation of contrivance.
The heavens, without purity, lack yin and yang—
Then fear they may fracture and fail to purify.
The earth, without tranquility, lacks firmness and softness—
Then fear it may erupt and fail to settle.
The spirit, without responsiveness, lacks relaxation and tension—
Then fear it may exhaust and fail to persist.
The valleys, without overflow, lack fullness and emptiness—
Then fear they may dry up and fail to brim.
Lords and kings, without righteousness,
Excessive pride, miserliness, or arrogance—
And those who claim nobility yet neglect the people—
Then fear their lineage may crumble and their temples topple.

Thus, the noble is rooted in the humble,
And disgrace precedes honor.
The exalted is founded upon the lowly,
And greatness arises from modesty.
Lords and kings, in their self-proclaimed restraint,
Are solitary and impoverished, lacking abundance,
Their names are obscure and their forms diminished—
Is this not the way to take the humble as root
And preserve the body within?

Not so! Their affairs are not the One.
Hence, they fashion the cart from non-cart,
And the thing from non-thing,
Not wishing to be busy like the solitary and obscure,
Nor to stand out like the stark and prominent.

The *Dao*’s movement and transformation
Are the principle of change—
The weak, its harmonious application.

The things of heaven and earth,
Having form, arise from causes and conditions;
Having life, arise from the void’s beginning.
The One is the child of *Dao*,
The mother of luminous intelligence,
The source of great harmony,
The ancestor of heaven and earth.

To the spirit, it is non-existence;
To the *Dao*, it is existence.
To the spirit, it is vast;
To the *Dao*, it is minute.
Thus, in its manifestation,
It is both empty and real,
Both nonexistent and existent,
Round yet not circular,
Square yet not measured.
It stretches without end,
Moves without trace,
Neither floats nor sinks,
Neither proceeds nor halts—
It acts yet does not act,
It bestows yet does not give,
Its changes are boundless,
Its principles are contained in the whole.

The void of non-void,
The beginning of beginnings,
Neither outer nor inner,
Mingled in primordial chaos—
Blurred and indistinct,
It may turn left or right.
In emptiness, it abides as constant,
In stillness, it reigns supreme.
It flows through the ten thousand heavens,
It permeates the myriad lands.
All things arise from it,
Yet it bears no form or sign.

The One alone remains,
In mysterious solitude,
All-encompassing without gaps,
Unchanging in simplicity.
Mingled in dark clarity,
It lacks nothing.
It molds the luminous spirit,
Yet does not share its nature.
It shapes the heavens and earth,
Yet does not dwell among them.

It receives without depletion,
It gathers without hoarding—
Neither crooked nor straight,
Neither first nor last.
Its grandeur is boundless,
Its depths unfathomable.
Above and below cannot conceal it,
Its currents cannot be measured.
It spreads and nourishes,
Radiant and unceasing—
Nourishing without mingling,
Transforming without joining.
It does not create, yet all things arise;
It does not act, yet all things are accomplished.
Beyond heaven and earth,
Within the smallest measure,
The breath of *qi* differs,
The forms and kinds are diverse—
Yet all attain the One’s essence to live,
And all fulfill its transformation to thrive.

Thus, the One is the guiding thread for all things,
And the supreme principle of change.
It is the standard for all directions,
And the balance for all variations.
The One is its name,
Virtue its title,
Non-existence its dwelling,
Non-action its work,
Formlessness its measure,
Return its great cycle,
Harmony its end,
The weak its use.
Thus, to know the One,
All changes are inexhaustible,
All transformations are unerring;
To fail to know the One,
Fortunes wax and wane,
Those who rule nations perish,
Those who guard their lives are lost.

Therefore, the ancients who attained the One:
The heavens, in their nature, attained the One’s purity,
Yet what the heavens do is not purity.
Without heart or intent,
Without action or deed,
They follow their nature.
Mysterious and silent,
Without container or shape,
They preserve their life.
Thus, yin and yang arise spontaneously,
Change unfolds naturally—
So they move with firm yet yielding vigor,
Achieving their height,
Luminous and clear,
Greatly harmonious,
Pure and true, unmingled—
The *Daoyi* stands grand,
Radiant and resplendent,
All things draw from its beginning,
Clouds and mists ascend,
Forms and kinds flow forth,
The primal breath of life—
Mysterious and boundless,
Without fail, it covers all.

The heavens attain the One with purity.

The earth, in its nature, attains the One’s tranquility,
Yet what the earth does is not tranquility.
Without knowledge or perception,
Without action or deed,
They follow their nature.
Without measure or number,
Without worry or gain,
They preserve their life.
Thus, mountains and rivers arise spontaneously,
Firmness and softness align naturally—
So they remain steadfast yet yielding,
Direct yet harmonious,
Vast and limitless,
Deep and serene,
All things draw from them to live,
None fail to be sustained.

The earth attains the One with tranquility.

The spirit, in its nature, attains the One’s responsiveness,
Yet what the spirit does is not responsiveness.
Without thought or deliberation,
Without action or deed,
They follow their nature.
Without schemes or plans,
Without echoes or beginnings,
They preserve their life.
Thus, ebb and flow arise spontaneously,
Preservation and extinction align naturally—
So the aged can return to vigor,
The dead can revive,
The trapped can find release,
The ruined can flourish anew—
Change knows no limit,
Return is endless,
All kinds entrust themselves to it,
None stray from its core.

The spirit attains the One with responsiveness.

The valleys, in their nature, attain the One with fullness,
Yet what the valleys do is not fullness.
Without desire or seeking,
Without action or deed,
They follow their nature.
Without kindness or righteousness,
Without giving or bestowing,
They preserve their life.
Thus, solid and void arise spontaneously,
Flourishing and decline align naturally—
So they steam the mountains and flow the marshes,
Becoming pathways of virtue,
Trickling yet ceaseless,
Endless yet uninterrupted,
Radiant and boundless,
Extending far without end,
Filling the rivers and seas,
Deep and vast beyond measure.

「The valleys attain the One with fullness.
The lords and kings’ nature attains the One’s *正* (orthogonality/rectitude), yet what lords and kings do is not rectitude.
Discarding the heart and the will,
Without action or deed,
They follow their nature;
Discarding sharpness and brilliance,
In emptiness and stillness, they respond naturally,
To preserve their life.

Thus, harmony arises spontaneously,
All things align naturally—
So they embody the Dao and harmonize with virtue,
Uniting with Heaven’s principles,
Clasping the spirit and treading upon harmony,
Enveloping all things,
Their influence transforms the myriad,
Filling the six directions with abundance,
Their virtue guides Heaven and Earth,
Their clarity shines like sun and moon,
Their rule governs the world and directs the customs,
Making all under Heaven one.

Lords and kings attain the One to establish rectitude for all under Heaven.
In all these five cases—
Attaining the One and acting upon it—
They flourish without decline,
Achieve without deficiency,
Flow without interruption,
Glow without extinction.

Why is this so?
Nature and life are spontaneous,
Their movement follows the One.

Thus, if Heaven acts,
Its movement does not follow the One,
It will gain elevation yet lose stability,
Gain purity yet risk fracture,
And the yin and yang will stray from their proper courses,
The fundamental principles will slacken,
The harmonious *qi* will be blocked—
The Three Lights will vanish,
Thunder and lightning will act in disorder,
And all things will lose their way.
Heaven, without stillness, will fear fracture.

If Earth acts,
Its movement does not follow the One,
It will gain straightness yet lose flexibility,
Gain tranquility yet risk eruption—
Mountains and rivers will crumble,
The firm and yielding will be twisted,
The *qi*’s transformation will not flow,
The Five Phases will be impaired,
All grains will wither,
And living beings will suffer pestilence.
Earth, without tranquility, will fear eruption.

If the spirit acts,
Its movement does not follow the One,
It will gain openness yet fall into constraint,
Gain responsiveness yet risk exhaustion—
Change will lose its order,
Movement will stagnate and deplete,
Those who flourish will perish,
Those who relax will die.
The spirit, without responsiveness, will fear exhaustion.

If the valleys act,
Their movement does not follow the One,
They will gain existence yet risk annihilation,
Gain fullness yet risk depletion—
Void and solid will invert,
Flows will not enter.
The valleys, without fullness, will fear depletion.

Lords and kings who act,
Their movement does not follow the One,
They will gain nobility yet lose humility,
Gain rectitude yet risk downfall—
In chaos and confusion,
Actions spring from their own will,
Officials stray from the center,
They lose their true name and substance,
The people do not return,
And Heaven and Earth will sever.
Kings without nobility will fear downfall.

In all these five cases—
Nature and life, purity and beauty—
Change reaches its utmost extremes,
Advance and retreat, bending and extending,
Never straying from the proper measure—
Attaining the One, they endure;
Losing the One, they perish.
Much less so for those who rule the myriad without being sages,
Who abandon the proper measure and follow their own hearts.

To uphold the proper measure in action
Is still not free from blame and calamity,
Much less so for those who abandon the measure and follow their hearts—
Thus, they perish in no time.

Therefore, the Dao of Heaven and humanity,
The myriad transformations of things—
The few become the many,
The humble become noble,
The high become low,
The completed become ruined,
What benefits becomes harm,
What profits becomes injury.
Those who dwell in opposition find their reversal,
Those who seek gain lose what they cherish.
This is called: *"Nobility rests upon humility as its foundation,
Elevation rests upon lowliness as its base."*

Thus, the virtuous ruler and sage sovereign
Hold sway over the people,
Their rank is esteemed throughout the world,
Their blessings extend to all things,
Their virtue encompasses the four seas.
The Dao protects them,
Heaven and Earth assist them,
All things return to them,
Ghosts and spirits align with them,
Their austerity inspires virtue,
Yet they call themselves solitary and few.
This is called: *"Lords and kings, calling themselves solitary and few, do not attain the valleys."*

Dwelling in lowliness and guarding modesty,
Engaging in labor and hardship,
Humbling their hearts and curbing their wills,
Striving to place themselves below the people—
Not claiming nobility, so they command the people’s lives;
Not claiming elevation, so they remain above the people;
Not desiring, so they possess all;
Not acting, so they govern all.
Amidst the myriad’s confusion,
Their own being is uninvolved—
Thus they become the foundation of all.
This is not unique to the ruler’s Dao;
All affairs are the same.

The craftsman shaping a carriage,
Makes it round or square,
Short or long,
Curved or straight,
Vertical or horizontal—
Yet all his life he labors,
And in the end, it is not a carriage—
Thus he can complete the carriage and make it usable.
This is called: *"Counting the carriage without making it a carriage, yet achieving its form."*

Jade, as a thing,
Is subtle and few;
Yet stone, as a thing,
Is vast and many.
Many, hence humble;
Few, hence noble.
Jade and stone,
Though born of the same kind,
Few and many,
Are either sought or discarded.
Thus, nobility and humility lie in abundance or scarcity,
Success and failure lie in whether one acts or not.
Thus, neither does one desire to be polished like jade,
Nor to be coarse like stone.

Therefore, the sage acts through reversal,
Guards through harmony,
Adapts with the times in ascent and descent,
Follows transformations in things.
Neither stone nor jade,
Ever dwelling between them—
Neither excessive nor deficient,
Neither noble nor humble—
The One as their guiding principle,
The Dao as their supporting structure.
Thus they can dominate all under Heaven with power that cannot be overcome,
Preserve all living things with virtue that cannot be measured—
Noble yet without worry,
Humble yet without harm,
Elevated yet without peril,
Lowly yet ever more secure,
Discerning in reversal,
Returning to primal silence,
Clear in presence and absence,
Reverting to the first beginning.

Without acting for themselves,
Their spirit and clarity do not falter;
Without acting for all under Heaven,
All under Heaven aligns with them.
This is called: *"Reversal is the Dao’s movement,
Weakness is the Dao’s use."*

Why is this so?
Following the Dao in movement,
Conforming to the One in action—
The Dao’s utmost subtlety,
The One’s greatest simplicity—
Change arises through reversal,
Harmony through refinement,
Existence through non-action.
Heaven and Earth are born from the Great Harmony,
The Great Harmony is born from the Void and Dark.
The Void and Dark are the utmost non-being,
Yet the Great Harmony begins with them and generates.
The Great Harmony has the seed of being,
And Heaven and Earth draw upon it to begin—
This is called: *"Heaven and Earth, the myriad, are born from being,
Being is born from non-being."*

The upper sage hears the Dao and finds it profound and good,
Diligent in following it, for their nature is near;
The middle sage hears the Dao and doubts it shallowly,
As if it exists or does not, for their nature is distant;
The lower sage hears the Dao and finds it unnatural,
Laughing at it, for their nature is opposed—
Not to laugh is insufficient for the Dao;
The Dao’s symbols must be displayed.»

「Thus, the sage sets forth the words of *having*—
To present the Dao as though in darkness, yet its movement is ceaseless and subtle;
To advance the Dao as though in retreat, returning to its origin;
To smooth the Dao as though with a file, refining its roots;
To uphold the highest virtue like a valley, bestowing it in profound mystery;
To display great purity as though in disgrace, appearing unwise;
To manifest abundant virtue as though insufficient, leaving no trace to describe;
To establish virtue as though by stealth, diminishing the people’s blessings;
To reveal true essence as though in error, seeming shallow and lacking;
To embody the Dao’s vastness without corners, without crookedness or straightness;
To achieve greatness through slow maturation, not by immediate clarity;
To produce the grandest sound where voice is scarce, where speech is faint;
To manifest the most sublime forms where shape is none, where no setting is made;
To conceal the Dao without name, without posthumous titles, without distinction—

Only the Dao, indeed, is good at lending itself to completion,
And responds to all things.

**Returning to the source:**
The Way and virtue of Heaven and Earth each have their own patterns,
Things have their high and low, *qi* has its short and long.
Each takes delight in what it delights in,
Suffers from what it suffers,
Sees what it sees,
Hears what it hears,
Accepts and rejects with divergent paths#3,
Fears and rejoices in different directions.

Thus, the quail and partridge soar high,
Yet their whole day is spent in ceaseless flight,
While their hearts dwell in the humble weeds;
The wild goose and swan rise aloft,
Crossing east and west, spanning thousands and reaching ten thousand,
Yet their hearts dwell in the marshes and ponds;
The phoenix and *luan*#4 soar above the ninefold peaks,
Leisurely in the boundless purity,
Yet they always consider themselves lowly.

Stretching their necks, spreading their wings,
They skim the azure clouds,
Eclipse the sun and moon,
Soar high and drift far,
Go long days without eating,
Travel the nine regions,
Rest in the eight extremes,
And thus find their true fit.

The three creatures differ in their ways,
Yet all find joy in their own kind.

Therefore, the boundless source,
The ten-thousand-fathom springs,
Where the divine dragon takes its rest,
And tiny fish retreat—
High mountains and great mounds,
Deep forests and vast ravines,
Lush trees with sprawling branches—
Are where the great birds and tigers and leopards take delight,
Yet where the chickens and dogs recoil in disgust.

Alas, the inherited customs of the Three Dynasties,
The rustic scholars and inked literati’s refined styles,
Reciting the *Shijing* and *Shujing*,
Practicing rituals and etiquette,
Singing elegies and odes,
Plucking the *qin* and *se*,
Exalting benevolence and righteousness,
Honoring purity and clarity,
Studying past antiquity,
Mastering divination and numerology,
Fixing what is and condemning what is not,
Achieving personal security and fame,
With neighbors preserving their legacy—
These are the ways of the middle sage,
Yet abandoned by the upper sage.

In quiet seclusion and profound contemplation,
They strain their minds to comprehend all things,
Fabricate falsehoods and disguise reality,
Speak empty words of names and things,
Dash about in pursuit of advancement or retreat,
Ascend or descend, kneel or bow,
Regulate the rituals of the inner chambers,
Conform to the customs of their age,
Lean or recline, tilt or bow,
Strive to align with the world’s expectations,
Flatter the wealthy and honor the noble,
Cater to the masses’ ears and eyes,
Gain esteem and favor from the powerful,
Follow the trends of the common folk—
These are the practices of the lower sage,
Yet rejected by the middle sage.

Thus, rules and measures do not harm one another,
Diverse natures find their own harmony;
The wise and saintly are not paired with the unworthy,
The foolish and clever do not form a single group.

The noble take joy in simplicity and tranquility,
The petty revel in grand and imposing achievements,
Yet fail to understand the humble dwelling of the common folk,
Nor delight in the deeds of a true gentleman.

Birds and beasts all flourish together,
Each pursuing its own inclinations;
Scholars of all kinds traverse the world,
Each finding their own path.

Therefore, they abandon sharp intelligence,
Discard clever scheming,
Return to true simplicity,
Roam in the Great Purity,
Hold the world in disdain,
Stand aloof without blemish,
Let anger and joy not disturb their hearts,
Let profit and harm not enter their minds,
Treat noble and base as equal,
Hold life and death in balanced measure,
Act without striving,
Gaze upon the profound mysteries,
Their spirits serene and undefiled,
Embrace virtue and contain harmony,
Naturally reversing the transformations of the world.

This is what the greatest sages uphold,
And what the upper sages strive for,
While the middle sages are dazzled by it,
And the lower sages laugh at it in derision.

Thus, what the middle sages hear is not the utmost beauty,
And what the lower sages see is not the utmost goodness.
What dazzles the middle sages and amuses the lower sages
Is truly the most beautiful and good of all.

To lay out grand theories and expound lofty doctrines,
To display the natural and exhaust the subtle—
Then the middle sages are dazzled,
And the lower sages laugh in scorn.

To float empty words and wander in persuasions,
To generate endless variations and schemes,
To create blessings and seek advantages,
To achieve success and fulfill tasks—
Then the middle sages debate,
And the lower sages wake to awareness.

This is not because they delight in calamity and abhor fortune,
Nor because they value misfortune and despise blessings—
Their nature is far removed,
Their feelings opposed.

It is as though they were in the Yellow Springs,
Listening to the nine heavens,
Yet so distant and utterly cut off
That they cannot see or hear at all.

The lower sages do not laugh at the great Dao,
But the Dao is too lofty to be seen—
Like playing a drum before an ox,
That is why they laugh.

Thus, the sage sets forth the words of *having*—
Those who speak of *having* say the Dao is hard to know,
Trace the natural origin of all things,
And use these to guide the myriad directions of life.

To truly speak of *having* is beyond the grasp of the mediocre.
Once the extraordinary Dao is understood,
It is beyond the reach of ordinary men.

Why is this so?
The sage’s Dao is profound, subtle, vast, and distant,
Majestic yet elusive, dim yet luminous,
Empty yet tranquil, where all things pass.
From the finest to the grandest,
It has no form or image.

To push it to its limits is to know it cannot endure,
To constrain it tightly is to find words cannot express it,
To shift and disperse it is to see books cannot convey it—
The bright Dao appears as though in darkness.

Why does advancing the Dao seem like retreat,
And the lost Dao appear as though in existence?
To govern the world, one must first rectify oneself.

Empty stillness is the Dao’s gateway,
Tranquility is the root of the spirit,
Serenity is the origin of harmony,
Silence is the foundation of virtue,
Frugality is the vessel of *qi*,
Subtlety is the craft of action.

Dwelling beyond the realm of *having*,
Standing before the realm of *having*,
Abandoning the world,
First cultivating oneself,
Nurturing the spirit and accumulating harmony,
To govern one’s own heart—

The heart is the sovereign of the body,
The body is the heart of the state,
The world responds in kind,
As though by nature.

Thus, advancing the Dao seems like retreat.

Therefore, to smooth the Dao as though with a file,
Is to let the true and profound arise,
To discard its trappings and distinctions,
To abandon its divisions and logic,
To follow the people’s hearts,
To listen to their natural inclinations,
To extinguish its ornate expressions,
To level its highs and lows.

To break down barriers and shatter keys,
So that deceit naturally ceases;
To dismantle walls and scatter prisons,
So that the people naturally defend themselves—」

The breath of life ceases, the armies rest—
The world becomes a great marketplace.
Ten thousand regions flock to it,
Like rivers flowing to the sea.

The Dao is smoothed as though with a file.
Virtue like the Han Valley—
Not giving, yet all is given;
Not loving, yet all is benefited;
Not dwelling, yet not absent;
Without action, yet grace overflows;
Without kindness, yet blessings abound.
Nurturing all life,
As the mother of the world.

Abundant virtue is like a valley.
Great brightness, pure and green,
Ever as though in fear,
Without constraint yet power ascends,
Without reliance yet authority is heavy.
Virtue mingles with transformation,
Friending the world,
Emerging white, returning black,
Not for beauty’s sake,
Fleeing merit, shunning fame,
Yet ever luminous.

Great brightness seems like shame.
The person of abundant virtue—
Sincere and earnest,
As though insufficient,
Formless, without appearance,
Simple in emotion, easy in nature,
Transformed into childlike innocence,
Doing nothing yet all is done,
As though deaf, as though mute,
The body dwelling in one,
The spirit encompassing all.
Changes unseen, joys unheard,
As though closed, as though sealed,
Alone with the Dao.

Abundant virtue seems insufficient.

Establishing virtue like theft—
Nothing cannot be accomplished.
Plugging the people’s ears and eyes,
Adorning their spirits,
Cutting their desires to benefit their nature;
Extinguishing their pleasures to prolong their lives;
Reducing their adornments so they have no schemes;
Sealing their hearts and minds so they find peace.
Establishing virtue like theft.

Authentic substance like decay—
The people’s mysterious standard.
Nurturing them with the Dao,
Feeding them with virtue,
Guiding them with spirit,
Harmonizing them with laws,
Dwelling in heaven and earth,
Illuminated by sun and moon,
Transformed by yin and yang,
Sustained by water and grain,
Governed by the formless,
Bound by the boundless.

The world murmurs in submission;
The realm is at peace, all things flourish.
Yet it is not their doing,
Nor their virtue—
Great yet seeming small,
Pure yet seeming thin.
Authentic substance like decay—
Decay, meaning shallow and thin.

The great square has no corners,
Encompassing all without measure,
Square yet not square,
Straight yet not straight,
Without boundaries or walls,
Without laws or forms.
Not straight, not square—
All things find their place;
Not square, not straight—
Heaven and earth move naturally.
In action, it is the yin of negation;
In stillness, the yang of affirmation.
Harmony is the central sovereign;
Distinctions clarify themselves.
Unified with heaven, constant with earth.
The great square has no corners.

Thus, great vessels mature late,
Containing all without limit.
Transforming in the formless,
Changing without trace,
Moving yet soundless,
Acting yet bodiless.
Awe and virtue unseen,
Achievements unviewed,
Calamities stilled in darkness,
Blessings born in obscurity,
Silent yet accomplished—
This is called supreme skill.
All things arise from it,
Yet none know how.
Striving yet complete,
Thus enduring forever.
Great vessels mature late.

Therefore, the greatest sound is rare in voice,
Announced without words.
Speaking in silence,
Divine transmission unfolds—
Motionless, yet the world harmonizes.
Soundless, yet all things respond,
Heaven, earth, and all beings
In perfect accord, like echoes answering sound.
The greatest sound is rare in voice.

The greatest form is formless,
The greatest appearance has no shape.
Advancing, all things live;
Retreating, all things perish.
Heaven and earth bow and rise with it,
Yin and yang bend and stretch in response,
Following its form, mirroring its image,
Like shadow to shape.
The greatest form is formless.

Thus, the Dao’s fullness has no name,
Virtue’s abundance no posthumous title.
Merit surpasses measure,
Yet the world does not call it great;
Virtue spans the four seas,
Yet the world does not deem it noble.
Its radiance illuminates the six directions,
Yet returns to obscurity.
The Dao is hidden, nameless.

Why so?
The Dao’s transformation—
Beginning in the nonexistent,
Ending in the trivial,
Existing in nonexistence,
Lending in non-lending,
Moving, all things are made;
Still, the world is fulfilled.
Generous in lending, yet complete.

「**Chapter on the Generation of the Dao/Way**

The Dao/Way generates *One*—a state of confused and indistinct darkness. *One* generates *Two*, which is the realm of the divine and luminous. *Two* generates *Three*, the harmonious mingling of purity and turbidity. *Three* generates the myriad things, manifesting as the forms of Heaven and Earth and humanity.

All things bear yin within and embrace yang without, turning toward the yielding to give rise. The subtle *qi* unites them in harmony, and the weak become complete. What humanity abhors—nameless, solitary, and lowly—are the very things that earn the titles of *Ruler* and *Noble* through ritual and birth. To diminish it is to benefit it; to benefit it is to diminish it. To teach it as lowly and weak is also to teach it as the sacred and knowing. The arrogant and forceful have power, yet they cannot command even their own death, making them cheap in life. I shall use them as examples of calamity and extreme misfortune.

**Annotations on *Zhi Gui* (指归):**
The *void within the void*—opening and guiding the reception—is the void itself, the Dao/Way.
There is no *void* without the void, yet the void cannot void itself.
The Dao/Way can void and thus generates all things, but all things cannot void and generate the Dao/Way.
Therefore, the Dao/Way is the origin from which all things void—the reason it is said: *"There is no void without the void, yet the void cannot void itself."*

The *void* that generates is the transformation and change of the subtle.
The origin of existence is the subtle, yet existence cannot generate itself.
The subtle is *One*.
*One* can be the origin of existence, but it is not a tangible form of existence that cannot generate itself—hence: *"The origin of existence is the subtle, yet existence cannot generate itself."*

The *void of the nonexistent*—the divine and luminous—cannot be altered.
The *void* that creates existence is the nonexistent, yet the nonexistent cannot exist.
The nonexistent is *Two*.
*Two* arises from *One*, though it has a form, and thus can create existence—but it is not existence itself that can create. Hence: *"The nonexistent is the void that creates existence, yet the nonexistent cannot exist."*

The *void* that generates is the subtle and mysterious.
The *void* that moves and completes is the completed, yet the completed cannot complete itself.
The *void* is *Three*.
*Three* arises from *Two*, yet also has its form, rooted in *One*, receiving its mandate from the divine. It portends the generation of all things, yet all things cannot complete it—hence: *"The void that moves and completes is the completed, yet the completed cannot complete itself."*

Thus, the *void within the void* generates the *voids*—the nonexistent, the nonexistent, and the void that generates form.
Therefore, all things with form belong to the category of *things*, and each thing has its origin, each category its ancestor.
Heaven and Earth are the greatest of things; humanity follows next.

Now, the generation of Heaven and humanity—
Form arises from *qi*,
*Qi* arises from harmony,
Harmony arises from the divine and luminous,
The divine and luminous arise from virtue and the Dao/Way,
Virtue and the Dao/Way arise from naturalness,
And all things exist.

Naturalness is the name given to that which no thing compels—it is the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way’s natural transformation generates the divine,
The divine communicates and forms harmony,
Harmony disperses and becomes *qi*,
*Qi* condenses and takes form.
Hence it is said: *"The Dao/Way generates One, One generates Two, Two generates Three, Three generates all things."*

Therefore, Heaven is called Heaven not because it is Heaven,
And humanity is called humanity not because it is humanity.
Existence arises from the origin, yet the origin cannot generate existence—hence: *"What is called humanity is not humanity."*

How can this be made clear?
Zhuangzi said:
When a person’s form decays, where does it derive from?
When the wise and responsive shine forth, where do they obtain this?
When transformation reaches its end, who is its author?
The origin lies in the nonexistent.
From this perspective, existence arises from the nonexistent,
And reality arises from the void—this is made clear.

Thus, the nonexistent is the origin of the nonexistent,
And cannot be grasped in existence.
It has no form, no sound, and cannot be heard or seen.
Receiving the nonexistent and granting existence—
This cannot be spoken or explained as the Dao/Way.

The nonexistent is the origin of the nonexistent,
The beginning of the unbegun.
All things derive from it,
And it is the source of life and nature.
That which has no name is called the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way is the origin of *One*.

The Dao/Way is the void within the void,
And thus can generate *One*.
The origin is tranquil and boundless—
It is the void within the void that first generates *One*.

There is a primal *thing* of confusion and indistinction,
Vague and indistinct in its emergence.
Light yet not dispersing, heavy yet not settling,
Yang yet without exterior, yin yet without interior.
It has neither above nor below, nor left nor right,
Reaching through without boundary—
It is the guiding principle of the Dao/Way.
Embracing the void, it is spacious and empty,
Enfolding what has not yet come into being.
Formless, nameless,
Blazing yet indistinct,
Confused yet indistinct,
Dark yet beyond measure—
It vanishes in sound and color,
And nothing can compare to it.
Point to it, and there is no direction,
Seize it, and there is nothing to grasp.
Vast and boundless, it cannot be reasoned or explained,
Grand and harmonious, without end or beginning,
The dwelling of all things,
The first of the primordial—
Thus it is called *One*.

The primordial *One* has the nonexistent,
The nonexistent is nameless.
That from which *One* arises—
The *One* yet without form—
Is the virtue/power within the confused darkness that can generate.

Thus, without end or beginning,
Without left or right,
Seeming yin yet not yin,
Seeming yang yet not yang—
Hence: *"Yang without exterior, yin without interior."*

*One* is void, and thus can generate *Two*.
*One* is the void within existence, transforming into *Two*.
With *Two* things arising, subtle and refined,
They exist and sustain existence,
Following things in their transformations,
Slippery yet formless,
Their vitality never decaying,
Illuminating the dark mysteries,
Without direction or existence,
Enfolding Heaven and Earth,
Their origin unseen,
They cannot be traced by sound,
Nor evaded by form—
This is called the divine and luminous.

Existence sustains things, absence destroys them.
Wisdom and power cannot reach them,
Nor virtue and might be employed—
This is called *Two*.
*Two* is the divine and luminous.

*Two* arises from the origin’s nonexistent,
And thus can generate *Three*.
The divine and luminous are the nonexistent within the nonexistent,
And thus can generate *Three*.

With *Three* things arising together,
Mingled and indistinct,
Visible yet no form discerned,
Heard yet no sound perceived,
Seized yet no thread grasped,
Gazed upon yet no entrance seen—
It cannot be measured or fathomed,
Dark yet indistinct,
Grand yet harmonious,
Pure and turbid in unity,
Moving with harmony,
The origin of Heaven and humanity,
Yet without distinct form or boundary,
Rooted in *One*, receiving its mandate from the divine—
This is called *Three*.」

「Three is the *Great Harmony* (Tàihé).
*Three* arises from the nonexistent,
And thus can generate all things.
The *Great Harmony* is the nonexistent within the existent,
A single transformation yielding the existent,
Hence the saying: *Three* generates all things.
With purity and turbidity divided,
High and low arrayed,
Yin and Yang first distinguished,
And the *Harmonious Qi* (Hégǔ) flowing,
The *Three Lights* (Sānguāng) revolving,
All classes of beings born,
Things with form that may be traced,
Things with sound and color that may be seen and heard—
This is called all things.

When all things are born,
They all originate from the *Void* (Xū),
And begin with the nonexistent.
The *Void* is the root of the nonexistent,
The origin is the root of beginnings.

Backing Yin, facing Yang—
All things back Yin and face Yang.
Returning to softness, abandoning hardness,
In stillness and purity, unmoved,
Mind and intent not stirred,
Yet their form and substance refined,
Their vitality and spirit unbounded—
This is by containing *Harmonious Qi* (Hégǔ) and *Softness* (Ruò),
So that the *Way* is formless.

Thus, the *Void*, the nonexistent, the formless, the subtle, the few, and the soft—
These are the source from which Heaven and Earth arise,
And the root by which all things are generated,
What the common people detest yet rulers name themselves with,
The primal origin of all things,
The fundamental root of success.

For the *Void*, the nonexistent, the solitary, and the few—
These are the fundamental roots of all things,
Hence rulers name themselves with them,
Yet the common people detest them.

Therefore, the wise sovereign and saintly ruler,
With their utmost honor and greatest power,
Dwell in solitude and fewness,
Reside in humility and simplicity,
Pursue what they seek yet flee what they desire,
Discard greatness for smallness,
Find joy in lowliness and loss,
Leave no trace when they act,
Nor any mark when they withdraw,
Advance in fortune and retreat in calamity,
Act without doing, yet all things settle,
Observe not, listen not,
Embrace *Harmony* (Hé) in stillness,
Give birth to divine luminosity,
Their form and substance naturally upright,
Their advance and retreat in accordance with the *Way*,
Never altering their course,
Their virtue soaring like the wind,
Their principles reaching all things,
Heaven and Earth aiding them,
All things returning to them.

Loss is gain.
The common people are not so—
They see and hear only what is already manifest.
Seeing and hearing only manifest things,
They align with what has already come to pass,
And fail to perceive the changes yet unseen,
Hence they value hardness and strength.
Wielding great authority and creating power,
They govern all affairs yet fail to restrain them,
Dispising softness and fewness,
Distancing themselves from subtlety and the solitary,
Their actions clash with the *Way*,
Their stillness contradicts Heaven,
Divine luminosity dissipates into turbidity,
All affairs arise in chaos,
Their thoughts confused and errant,
Their joys and angers unfounded,
Fortunes flee the door,
Calamities enter the home,
The Heavenly Net descends—
They cannot escape it.

Gain is loss.
Then suddenly calamity arises,
And they awaken in sorrow,
Bow their heads in speech yet lower their words,
On the verge of death, they praise virtue.
Though they wish to reform and renew,
Returning to fewness and softness,
It comes too late, and they cannot be released,
Their path to life is distant,
Their nations shattered, their families ruined,
Their misfortunes extending to their descendants.
Hence, the teachings of the common people,
Transform stupidity into wisdom,
Change weakness into strength,
Abandon subtlety for the manifest,
Discard concealment for display,
Flout humility and compete for glory,
And die in pursuit of honor and fame.
This is what people are taught.

Yet the teachings of the *Sage* (Shèngrén) are contrary to this:
Stupidity becomes wisdom,
Humiliation becomes honor,
Subtlety becomes manifest,
Concealment becomes display,
Fewness becomes multitude,
Weakness becomes strength.
Abandon mind and intent,
Pursue the nameless,
Be without knowing or recognizing,
Return to the *Mysterious Darkness* (Xuānmíng).
Paths diverge, directions vary—
Some persist, some perish.

The teachings of the *Sage* teach with fewness and softness;
The teachings of the common people teach with multitude and strength.
What people are taught, I also teach—
Yet the teachings differ.

Hence, mighty Qin and great Chu,
With their strength and domination, were extinguished;
Divine Han and the rise of the *Dragon* (Lóng),
With their harmony and compliance, flourished.

Thus, the strong stray from the *Way*,
The hard reject divine luminosity,
And the ruler who seeks to live long
Must retreat in order to endure.
The strong and hard
Cannot escape their fate.

Not seeking within themselves,
They blame Heaven and fate,
The *Sage* pities them,
And sets forth these teachings first,
Recording them on bamboo and silk,
Clearly demonstrating them to later generations,
So that throughout their lives they may reflect upon them,
And thus incur their own misfortunes.
I shall make this my foundational teaching.

**Chapter on the *Ultimate Softness* (Zhìróu):**
The *Ultimate Softness* is the most formless thing under Heaven,
Yet it overcomes the most rigid and solid things in the world.
The formless enters the *Gapless Chamber of Non-Action* (Wújiān Wúwéi shì),
Thus I know to see gain and loss.
Non-action’s benefit is to preserve the original and cut off chaos;
Action’s harm is to disrupt the original and sever life.
The teaching of the unsaid closes the door to calamity,
Non-action’s benefit preserves all things,
Yet few under Heaven can attain it.

**Pointing to the Return:**
*Virtue* (Dé) and divine luminosity are the most subtle,
Yet they are the *guests* (Bīn) of divine luminosity.
Divine luminosity is the external manifestation of *Virtue*,
Hence it is called *guest*.

Divine luminosity is the most nonexistent,
Yet the *Great Harmony* is its *subject* (Chén).
The *Great Harmony* is the manifestation of divine luminosity’s work,
Hence it is called *subject*.

Purity and turbidity, the *Great Harmony*,
The *Ultimate Softness*—formless,
Enveloping Heaven and Earth,
Containing Yin and Yang,
Guiding all things,
Without fail maintaining their order.

Some exist beyond the cosmos,
Some dwell within Heaven,
Humans and things borrow from it to be born,
Yet none can see or hear it.

Following the *Way* through three transformations,
All things begin to form,
Humans borrow from it to be born,
Yet none can truly know it.

The hair-fine is insufficient to name it,
The weak are insufficient to describe it—
The *Sage* names it with intent alone.

How the *Sage* is called *Sage*:
All *Sages* obtain their title
By studying the *Way* and preserving divine luminosity,
Cultivating life and safeguarding truth,
Achieving truth and thus the *Way*,
Enveloping Heaven and Earth.

This is the profound and essential thing,
Hence it cannot be named with intent alone.
Therefore, it is called *Ultimate Softness*,
And named *Formless*.

Thus, the formless thing
Is not overcome by rigidity,
Nor by strength—
Hence it can wear down Heaven and Earth,
Consume copper and iron,
Race like the wind and lightning,
Span the poles and traverse sun and moon,
Circulate above and below,
Pass through and linger without pause,
Soar in stability,
And descend into the formless.

Things with form have solidity,
The *Void* without subtlety has no power.
The *Way*, neither existent nor nonexistent,
Can thus uphold existence without obstruction.

How does one demonstrate its truth?
The echo is without sound yet cannot be exhausted,
The shadow is without form yet cannot be measured,
Water, though soft and weak, pierces metal and stone,
And sinks all things.
Earth, though gentle and compliant, achieves great works,
And surpasses grass and trees.»

The tongue and ears suffer no harm,
Yet horns and teeth are injured and broken—
Thus it is seen: the soft overcomes the hard,
The empty overcomes the full—
Not by contrivance, but by nature’s own way.

Such is the inevitable order of things,
Unalterable and unavoidable.

This is the natural order of affairs,
Not the natural essence of the *Way*.

Thus, when the land is narrow and the people few,
With scant soldiers and meager provisions,
When desires are subtle and intentions refined,
When the spirit is bright and vigilant,
And harmony aligns with Heaven—

To regard the people as one’s own children,
With virtue flourishing and transformation vast,
With deep benevolence and abundant grace,
When officials are loyal and soldiers trustworthy,
When the ruler worries and generals tremble,
When softness accumulates and weakness endures,
Ever placing oneself last among the people,
Bearing shame and humiliation,
The state becomes a submissive female,
Yet the lords of the realm trust it,
Comparing it to an infant,
And all under Heaven flock to it,
As though returning to parents.

When the people share a single desire,
Authority and might arise naturally,
The strong cannot oppress,
The great cannot seize,
From beginning to end, strength and weakness invert,
Heaven and Earth lend their aid,
The spirit’s brilliance provides support,
Opportunity arrives without constraint,
And one becomes the master of all under Heaven.

Why is this so?
Because the *Way* is soft and weak,
Yet its essence is subtle and sparse.

Thus, when the land is vast and the people many,
When the state is rich and its armies strong,
When historians are bold and soldiers fierce,
When the ruler commands with severity,
When rewards are heavy and punishments sharp,
When laws are rigid and punishments deep,
When officials tremble before the sovereign,
When advantage favors terrain and strategy,
The realm becomes the hero of the world,
Lightly provoking enemies and delighting in battle,
Easily mobilizing troops,
Where cunning begets the extraordinary,
Where Heaven is defied and Earth is scorned,
Where lords submit in fear,
None dare resist,
Where terror shakes the borders,
Where one is always the model of excellence,
Where people fear and things tremble,
Where might shakes Heaven and Earth,
Where virtue and the *Way* are abandoned,
Where the spirit departs,
Where the weak unite in disunity,
Where the people do not rally,
Where the ruler dies and the state collapses,
Where the lineage scatters and disperses.

Why is this so?
Because their essence is hard and rigid,
And their greed and stinginess accumulate.

The *Way* manifests as the having of the non-existent,
Passing through without obstruction,
Moving without constraint,
Illuminating the halls of contrivance,
Purifying the chambers of non-action,
Entering and exiting without boundary or fracture,
Traveling through pearls and jade without trace.

It is said: the utmost softness
Overcomes the utmost hardness.
How does one demonstrate this?

Sharp blades with form
Cannot pierce the formless.
The spirit, dwelling in the body,
Exits without obstruction,
Enters without aperture—
In the blink of an eye,
It traverses thousands of miles.
There is no entering the formless.

From this, it is said:
Action brings ruin and no fruit,
Non-action brings fulfillment without end.
Heaven and Earth are thus formed,
Humans and things are thus flourished.
The sound of sound is heard a hundred *li* away,
The sound of no-sound moves beyond Heaven,
Shaking the four seas.

What is spoken of is spoken of—
Different kinds cannot communicate.
What is not spoken of—
Transforms yin and yang,
Makes Heaven and Earth respond.

For when virtue and the *Way* are in non-action,
Heaven and Earth are completed.
When Heaven and Earth do not speak,
The four seasons proceed.
These two things—
The signs of the spirit’s brilliance,
The verification of nature’s course.

Thus it is known that non-action is beneficial.
Therefore, the sage empties the heart
To return to virtue and the *Way*,
Calms the *qi* to preserve the spirit’s brilliance,
Diminishes sharpness to hear the soundless,
Abandons clarity to see the formless,
Observes the transformations of Heaven and Earth,
Encourages the natural course of all things,
To perceive how contrivance is the origin of chaos.
Having reached the function of non-action,
One naturally sees the disorder of contrivance.

Non-action is the root of governance.
Speech is the doorway to calamity.
Non-speech is the gate to blessing.
Thus, abandon wisdom and discard cleverness,
Eliminate benevolence and discard righteousness,
Awaken the heart of the *Way*,
Exalt the intention of virtue,
Follow the spirit and nurture harmony,
Entrust oneself to Heaven and serve Earth,
Let yin and yang fulfill their duties,
Let the four seasons move freely,
Cut off the roots of chaos,
Let things rest in their places,
Let the ruler remain serene and unadorned,
Let the people have no concerns.

Teach with the speech of no-speech,
Transform with the transformation of the untransformed,
Demonstrate with the symbol of no-symbol,
And return to the mysterious and profound,
Cover the people’s desires,
Follow their nature and vital essence,
Make the people ignorant,
And they will live long and see far.

This is the teaching of no-speech.

Thus, when I speak not, Heaven and Earth act without contrivance,
When Heaven and Earth act without contrivance, virtue and the *Way* act without contrivance.
These three harmonize and advance together,
Their *qi* blending and overflowing,
Generating great peace,
Gathering humans and things,
Unifying the world within,
Closing the door to calamity,
Making all under Heaven like infants,
With no shame or disgrace,
No sight of fortune or misfortune,
No knowledge of origins or endings,
Naturally vast and unrestricted,
Each household receiving the blessings of the spirit’s brilliance,
Each person achieving the deeds of the sage’s wisdom.

The benefits of non-action.

At such times,
The ruler is like Heaven and Earth,
The people like infants,
Drinking the ruler’s virtue,
Feeding on the ruler’s harmony,
Yin emerging, yang retiring,
Rolling and unfolding with the *Way*.
The sovereign and father above
Are present yet absent,
The world is dazed and content,
Soft and murmuring,
Unknowing like a newborn,
Non-action like a fledgling,
Born without joy,
Dying without sorrow,
Grieving yet enduring,
With vitality in excess,
Seeking nothing,
Yet blessings arrive of their own accord.
Few under Heaven attain this.

Why is this so?

The sovereign who does not speak yet embodies the Dao of non-action.
The key of non-action, the mechanism of speechlessness,
Lies in subtlety and refinement,
Resides in the divine and the profound.

The onset of the divine and profound,
The origin of subtlety and refinement,
Gives birth without root or stem,
Emerges and retreats without gate or door.
Ever abiding between action and non-action,
The primal source of harmony,
The Dao, though formless and unseen,
Can be known through its timely resonance.

Thus it may be heard yet never fully revealed,
Seen yet never fully expounded,
Grasped yet never fully transmitted,
Utilized yet never fully spoken.
To seize and then shove away,
To hold fast and then relinquish—
Easy for the wise sage to explain,
Difficult for the shallow to comprehend.

Why so?
Because it is vast and profound yet common folk cannot reach it,
Because its lofty heights are inverted yet common folk cannot enter,
Because it is faint and diffuse yet the world cannot discern it,
Because it is obscure and hidden yet vulgar rulers cannot practice it.

The body’s name—who is closer, fame or self?
Self or wealth—what is more abundant?
Gain or loss—what is more harmful?
Thus extreme affection brings great depletion to the spirit,
Excessive hoarding brings heavy ruin and retreat to the body.

Therefore, knowing sufficiency prevents disgrace,
Knowing cessation prevents peril,
And the body may endure long,
With great vitality preserved.
**Point of Return:**

That which I inherit by nature and am,
Is virtue and power.
That which I borrow to live,
Is the spirit’s brilliance.
That which I rely upon to flourish,
Is the Great Harmony.
That which I entrust to take form,
Are Heaven and Earth.

All these four—
They nourish me, yet I cannot nourish them.
Thus no law is higher than virtue and power,
No model is greater than the spirit’s brilliance,
No standard is broader than the Great Harmony,
No illumination is grander than Heaven and Earth.

Virtue and power—
Ever living, never dying;
Harmony of purity and turbidity—
Endless transformation.
The Dao of Heaven and Earth—
Preserved yet hard to lose;
The workings of yin and yang—
Ever moving, hard to conclude.

Heaven and Earth, yin and yang,
But seen in their difficulty to conclude,
Not because they lack beginning or end.
From this perspective,
Misfortune reaches its extreme at death,
Fortune reaches its extreme at birth.
Thus the sage,
Above, traces the intent of virtue and power,
Below, measures the heart of Heaven and Earth,
Exalts and displays honor,
Invokes auspiciousness and flourishing virtue,
Embraces depth and vastness,
Cultivates reverence and exhaustion,
Yet nothing surpasses the value of life.

All things arrayed,
Wonders and treasures,
Gold and jade, pearls and jade discs,
Their use profound yet their gain immense—
Nothing surpasses the body.

The artisan of worldly calamity,
The craftsman of national chaos,
Who defies Heaven and Earth,
Who harms the body—
Nothing surpasses the name.

**Extreme pride and excess,**
**Oppressing the people, impoverishing the state,**
**Disturbing the spirit’s clarity,**
**Multiplying desires of the heart,**
**Rebelling against Heaven, violating the Dao,**
**Competing to become thieves and robbers,**
**The world shuns them, wars abound,**
**One person’s actions bring ruin to ten thousand states,**
**The ruler dies, the people perish,**
**All creatures suffer their poison—**
Nothing surpasses wealth.

Though wealth and name are feared and shocking,
Their benefits to the body are distant indeed.
Thus gain and loss,
Sometimes harmful, sometimes useful.
Gaining name or wealth,
Virtue and power do not abide,
The spirit’s brilliance does not linger,
Great vitality is severed,
Heaven cannot save.

Losing name and wealth#1,
Virtue and power naturally support,
The spirit’s brilliance naturally aids,
Fame appears effortlessly,
Riches align with Heaven and Earth.
Gaining name or wealth,
Losing the Dao and the body.
Losing name and wealth,
Benefits align with Heaven and Earth.
Thus preserving the body while pursuing great fame,
Cannot yet be discussed in terms of the ultimate Dao;
Lightening the body while valuing the state,
Cannot yet be plotted for profit.

The name without name,
Is the dwelling of my life;
The name with name,
Is the sack that buries me.
The wealth without wealth,
Is the nourishment of my fortune;
The wealth with wealth,
Is the thief that robs me.
Thus extreme affection for the body,
To build and maintain fame,
Acting and laboring for it,
Forcing nature and temperament,
Only depletes the spirit.

Excessive accumulation of wealth,
Daily swelling with arrogance,
The path to ruin—
Wealth and name both end.
Extreme affection brings great depletion.

Thus the spirit’s brilliance cannot sustain life,
Heaven and Earth cannot preserve the body.
Why is this so?

The transformation of **Dao** and **virtue/power** follows the patterns of Heaven and Earth—
one yin, one yang,
dividing into the four seasons,
separating into the five phases,
spinning like a net,
setting traps without gaps.

All things’ natures,
each have their measure,
unable to interfere.
The heart of creation,
harmonious and upright with fairness,
naturally unified—
straightforward, balanced, and equal,
neither favoring nor rejecting,
communing with all things.
Extending the long,
continuing the short,
reducing the excess,
supplementing the deficient—
the insufficient are nourished,
the surplus perish.

Greed and accumulation bring self-inflicted calamity;
insufficiency without restraint stirs the heart of gain.
The wise deceive the foolish,
the strong seize what they desire—
Nature balances it:
name and profit return to their origin.
Losing them brings sorrow,
gaining them brings joy.
One joy, one sorrow—
the soul and spirit wander;
one sorrow, one joy—
the spirit departs.

When the body dies, the name vanishes,
and disaster extends to descendants.
Thus, name and profit with the body,
are like charcoal and ice—
forms and natures opposed,
their forces cannot coexist.
When name reaches its end and the body its limit,
there is none in the world who survives with both thriving.

The empty is where **Dao** returns,
the real is where things perish.
Now, if one accumulates the real and seeks to align with the empty,
it is like water and fire repelling each other—
impossible to achieve.

Thus, disturbing the heart, scheming the mind,
using emotions to exhaust the spirit,
night and day pursuing affairs,
adornment and rhetoric,
worrying over the masses,
creating deeds and establishing merit,
striving for self-discipline to display virtue—
this depletes what sustains life
and increases what destroys it.

Exhausting sinew and strength,
enduring hunger and thirst,
bearing cold and heat,
treading dangers and narrow paths,
coarse clothing and poor food,
unsuited to appetite,
serving court and night,
bearing shame and disgrace,
spirit and essence fleeing—
unrelenting, opposing **Dao** for glory,
entering excess to possess,
risking the body for security—
wealth accumulates while the spirit perishes,
disaster naturally follows.
Arrogance and ruin arrive together—
this is using fortune to destroy fortune,
seeking profit while losing it.

The more one hoards, the greater the ruin.
Thus, success and failure depend on action or inaction,
life and death on departure or arrival.

Therefore, those who know sufficiency,
align with **Dao** and virtue/power,
abandon name and profit,
establish the self in non-being,
nourish things without self-generation,
share with things without self-preservation—
in sincerity and compliance,
sufficient to preserve the spirit.
Household affairs suffice for a lifetime.

Ever natural, thus unassailable;
dwelling in emptiness, thus unpenetrable;
light on name, light on things, thus unstained;
desiring without desire, thus enduring glory—
this is called *not being humiliated*.

Those who know restraint,
whether noble as a sovereign or poor in caves,
do not distort their will,
nor dim their spirit.
Advancing does not bring pride,
retreating does not bring despair.
No gain, no loss,
no guilt, no merit,
no seeking, no refusal—
like the sea, like a great river,
wandering in the boundless domain,
spirit and clarity unified.
Moving in harmony with Heaven and Earth,
thus unshaken;
distinct from harm and gain,
thus ever constant.

Thus, profound and unshaken,
spirit firm and unbroken,
like Heaven and Earth in grandeur,
like the sun and moon in radiance—
both refined and spiritual,
to preserve the body.
Knowing sufficiency and stopping,
thus enduring forever.
Knowing restraint brings no peril.

This is called *chasing name while name pursues me*,
*fleeing profit while profit pursues me*.
To conceal desire while revealing it—
this can endure forever.

**Great attainment resembles a missing chapter**—
great attainment resembles a missing law—
formless, its use unexhausted, transformation flowing.
**Great fullness resembles emptiness**—
masterless, its use unfathomable, principles vast.
**Great straightness resembles bending**—
nameless,
great skill resembles clumsiness—
unaccomplished,
great eloquence resembles stammering—
full yet empty.
**Agitation overcomes cold**—
movement in form and appearance,
**stillness overcomes heat**—
calm in form and spirit.
To be able to still and clear—
this is Heaven and Earth,
the rectifier for all things, the standard of the world.

**Pointing to the return:**
**Dao** and virtue/power act without action, yet spirit is manifest;
spirit acts without action, yet **Great Harmony** arises.
Without action, things regulate themselves.
Some are born without roots, some walk without feet,
some hear without ears, some sing without mouths—
diverse kinds, distinct orders,
all trading with them.
Mothers grieve for their children,
children grieve for their mothers,
male and female pair,
things honor their masters,
nest-born peck, womb-born nurse,
birds scatter when startled,
beasts flee when alarmed,
yin-things dwell in burrows,
yang-things nest above,
fire moves upward in flame,
water moves downward in moisture—
all things verdant,
spring born, summer growing,
autumn ripening, winter maturing—
all return to soil.
No governance or teaching—
things act naturally.

This is the natural **effort**, **pattern**, and **measure** of yin and yang,
inevitable as such.

From this perspective,
*non-action* does not generate *non-action*,
*negation* does not generate *negation*,
*clarity* does not generate *clarity*,
*obscurity* does not generate *obscurity*.
*Non-action* is not *negation*,
*clarity* is not *obscurity*—
only then does one grasp the rhythm.

*Non-action* is not *negation*,
*clarity* is not *obscurity*—
this is ease, aligning with **Dao**.

Thus, the **Great Dao** is vast and open,
not confined to doors—
the farther it extends, the fewer who know it.
**Dao** resides in the self, not in the wild,
transformation originates within, not from without—
all things perpetually ordered,
wisdom does not arise.

Therefore, the sage holds **Harmony** and treads **Rectitude**,
governs without form,
wanders in emptiness,
mirroring **Great Clarity**,
abandoning soul and spirit,
resting essence and spirit,
acting without action,
silent yet trustworthy,
vast and boundless,
illuminated and solitary—
approaching yet unattainable,
its essence true,
its use unexhausted,
unseen, unheard.

This is called **great attainment resembling a missing chapter**—
its use unexhausted.

Why is this so?

Subtle and thorough,
clear and still in truth,
before form and sound,
transforming its origin—
opening like yang,
closing like yin,
blocked like earth,
moving like Heaven.
**Patterned and martial**, **mysterious and virtuous**—
profound virtue naturally divides.

Thus, when full yet appearing empty,
when solid yet appearing void,
when benevolence and righteousness are not flaunted,
when propriety and decorum are unseen,
when laws and institutions are not erected,
when action is not contrived—

The ruler desires not to desire,
yet the world transforms itself.
Gentle and unadorned, the people are like infants,
dimly unaware, their longings vague,
their paths unknown—
its use inexhaustible,
flowing yet never decaying.

Great fullness resembles emptiness,
its use inexhaustible.

Without tilling, food is plentiful;
without weaving, clothing is ample.
In summer, they rest in nakedness;
in winter, they wrap in furs.
No taboos exist—
they dwell with beasts, unbound,
hair loose, suckling at will,
wandering freely together.
The ruler abounds in virtue,
the people abound in wealth.

Its transformation pervades all things,
doing without doing.
Its radiance unseen, its mystery profound—
Heaven, Earth, and all beings
transform with it in harmony.

Riding the void, bearing the empty,
wandering with the Dao,
measuring the four seas,
circulating through the six voids,
vast and boundless,
dwelling in the utmost nothingness.

Why is this so?
Straight yet appearing crooked,
true yet appearing wrong.
Great straightness seems like crookedness.

When the ruler speaks, the world echoes;
when the ruler acts, all beings follow.
Thus, without sacrifices, Heaven’s harmony aligns,
without decrees, the four seas rectify.
Hence it is said: *Great skill resembles clumsiness.*

Heaven’s Way is naturally humble—
without calendars, yin and yang harmonize;
without fixed seasons, the four times proceed;
without laws, the world is at ease;
without rewards or punishments, names and realities align.

Concealing martial might, it conquers all;
abandoning warfare, it overcomes all.
Without commands, the people govern themselves;
without rituals, the realm enlightens itself;
without seals, the world trusts itself;
without measures, all things balance themselves.

Great eloquence seems like stammering.
Thus, though weak, it appears deficient;
though gaining, it seems like loss.
Without bells and drums, the people rejoice;
without five flavors, their food is sweet;
without adornments, their beauty is natural;
without hoarding, their abundance overflows.

Why is this so?
Following the Dao, trusting Heaven, not relying on knowledge—
thus the people act naturally.

Though the Five Emperors seemed unworthy,
each achieved greatness.
The enlightened ruler, through the Dao, transforms people,
making them align with the Way.

Heaven and Earth’s Way—
advancing and retreating in turn—
all things thereby flourish.
Transformation is unobstructed,
flexing and extending cannot be barred.

When yin reaches its peak,
the earth splits and ice congeals,
cold winds howl, frost descends thick,
fish and turtles burrow deep,
all things curl in fear.
Yet in this time,
dwelling in warm chambers,
beside blazing fires,
wearing thick furs and layered silks—
still, one cannot withstand it.
But when the mind steadies and the spirit calms,
when the body moves and toils,
then sweat pours, garments are cast aside,
and warmth suffuses the body.
*Agitation overcomes cold.*

When yang reaches its peak,
sand is seared, stones crumble,
birds take flight, water creatures flee,
all things wither, rivers dry up.
Yet in this time,
plunging into cool springs,
wearing coarse linen,
dwelling in high halls,
wearing cold stones—
still, one cannot endure it.
But when the heart releases, the mind clears,
when the spirit drifts beyond the four seas,
when the will wanders in the void,
when breath and heart align—
coolness pervades the body.
*Stillness overcomes heat.*

Thus, knowing how to act is a craft—
governing people, nurturing life,
virtue extending to Heaven and Earth,
achievement matching yin and yang.
Yet when chaos arises,
it emerges without form,
stirs without sound,
expanding with governance,
shifting with transformation.
It seizes people like dampness,
reaches them like shadow—
responding like echoes to speech,
never leaving their forms.
The more one acts, the greater the disorder;
the more one governs, the more tangled the affairs.
Even the wise cannot lead,
even harsh punishments cannot restrain.

Yet the *non-acting* ruler
is the sovereign of action,
the origin of governance and transformation,
whose removal of calamity
is like agitation overcoming cold
or stillness overcoming heat.

Thus the sage abandons knowledge, abandons scheming,
empties the heart, focuses the breath,
clears and stills, responding naturally—
then Heaven’s will aligns,
Earth’s intent follows,
governance rises, transformation flows like sunlight,
calamity vanishes like dispersing clouds.
The world follows its example without limit,
all things learn from it without restraint.

This is called *able to clear, able to still—
the world naturally rectifies itself.*

---
**When the Way prevails in the world, the ruler desires nothing—**
even warhorses are turned to manure for fields.
**When the Way does not prevail, the ruler takes action—**
warhorses breed in the suburbs, laws favor martial might.

No sin is greater than ceaselessly pursuing desire,
no calamity greater than insatiable greed,
no blame greater than coveting gain.
Contentment’s fullness knows no lack—
it possesses all without taking.

**The Way’s return:**
A person’s life is entrusted to the ruler;
the ruler’s standing depends on the people.
When the ruler follows the Dao, the people flourish;
when the ruler loses the Dao, the people perish.
The people’s flourishing makes temples glorious;
their ruin makes temples crumble.
Thus the ruler is the people’s source;
the people are the ruler’s root.
When the root is injured, flowers and fruit wither;
when the source decays, the flow runs dry.
Above and below sustaining each other—
thus they endure.

Therefore, when the ruler follows the Dao,
the world is undisturbed,
lords and vassals submit in reverence,
barbarians rejoice in submission,
the four seas share the same winds,
weapons never rise,
border guards have no use for their words,
mighty warriors have no place for their strength.

The wise and clever till where rain falls,
fine steeds pull plows.
This is called: *When the Way prevails, even warhorses are turned to manure.*

The world at ease, each pursues their work,
customs are sincere, the people unified—
clothing woven from hemp, food from tilling,
Heaven’s heart in harmony, all things bountiful,
auspicious omens frequent, blessings abundant.
Not Heaven’s bestowal, but the ruler’s virtue and Dao.

「When the Son of Heaven loses the Dao,
lords do not pay tribute,
valleys split and streams diverge,
laws and institutions clash and differ,
the four quarters rebel and vie in strength,
raising armies to contest authority—
the weak become captives#2,
the strong become rulers.

Thus, the land selects generals and sharpens warriors,
kindling beacon fires on all sides,
deeply plotting and crafting great deceits,
strategizing in the halls of state,
concocting schemes that spawn rebellion,
forming shifting alliances—*crossing and combining*—
light chariots and swift cavalry surge forth,
enemies rise to match them in might,
warriors and steeds perish in the wilderness,
year after year without return,
their ambition and force twisted into ruin,
their governance marked by treachery and violence.

In such times, they groom warhorses
without pause for kin,
race to battlefields first,
dwell on coarse fare of beans and millet,
greedy men sit as butchers,
lowly servants rise as brigands,
the people exhausted and spent,
treasures drained, strength weary,
endless conscription and military labor.

This is why warhorses are born in the wilds.

They long to return home,
but sorrow and lament fill their hearts—
remembering parents aged and weary,
weeping in exile.

Kind fathers and benevolent mothers,
grief and anguish pierce their souls,
their resolve and spirit shattered within.

Soldiers lie slain, heads and heels bound,
bones exposed to the elements,
scattered in the desolate fields—
numberless beyond reckoning.

The roads stretch desolate,
all are fatherless sons,
yearning for command,
rising with sobs and tears—
what crime against Heaven,
to suffer such calamity?

Females lack husbands,
children lack fathers,
their cries of woe and sorrow
gather without cause.

The mighty become leaders,
the middling become butchers,
those above and below protect one another,
inner and outer realms guard as one—
not bound by blood,
yet closer than brothers.

Tall grasses serve as banners,
hollowed earth as drums,
seizing weapons and wielding tools,
marching in disciplined ranks,
constantly drilled in warfare,
their thoughts and loyalty fixed on their lord,
so ardent that their spirits intertwine,
their *qi* and transformations move as one.

Thus, Heaven and Earth grow rigid and disjointed,
yin and yang are severed and blocked,
stars scatter and wander,
sun and moon clash in eclipse,
deceit and rebellion sprout,
calamities arise in tandem—
not Heaven’s infliction of woe,
but the ruler’s loss of the Dao.

The ruler without the Dao
was not born without the Dao,
but first gained Heaven’s mandate through it,
yet failed to uphold it,
and in arrogance and excess,
knowing no bounds,
reverts to his original desires,
sharing the same fate as slaves and captives.

To receive Heaven’s grand mandate,
to follow the sacred ones before,
noble as the Son of Heaven,
rich with all the four seas,
honored with supreme rank and favor—
none can compare.

Yet coarse robes and simple furs are deemed delight,
plain vegetables and humble broths are called exquisite.

To transform the world and shift its customs
is as effortless as wind bending grass;
the people’s conformity
is as natural as fish to water.

If one does not strive to elevate the Dao,
broaden virtue,
refine oneself and rectify one’s conduct,
grieve for the common folk,
to fulfill ancestral sacrifices,
to honor forefathers and pass on their legacy—
to vie with Heaven and Earth in renown,
to share their eternal preservation—
but instead pursues pride and extravagance for fame,
seeks power without restraint,
defies Heaven and opposes Earth,
spurning all with insolence—

then the unworthy rise in defiance,
lightly pressing deep into battle,
the first to arrive are deemed rightful,
distant foes go unchallenged,
alliances fracture, bonds dissolve,
the inner and outer realms offer no reliance,
and with their deaths comes the fall of the state,
the ancestral temples crumble—
yet these are the consequences of their own greed,
not the fault of the world.

This is called: *No guilt is greater than unchecked desire.*

Thus, those who wield authority and honor,
exhausting the people’s limits,
whose fame and titles cover the land,
yet know no contentment—
they become instruments of disaster,
the grand measure of their own ruin.

No misfortune is greater than knowing no contentment.

For the ruler’s virtue and sacred power,
to mold and transform—
already attained, they preserve the people,
unify spirit and form,
and take great shape.

Their movements are effortless,
ears and eyes keen,
wandering in bright and open realms,
listening across Heaven and Earth,
observing Nature’s eternal laws,
studying the gains and losses of ancient generals—
digging wells to drink,
plowing fields to eat,
long wives and children born,
living in harmony with fate—
this is true contentment,
the fullness of sufficiency.

Different beings share the same attainment,
thus it is sufficiency.

How much more so for the lord of ten thousand chariots,
the ruler of a thousand chariots?

Their sufficiency is clear indeed.»

The Way is not in this—
when greed arises in the heart,
coveting others’ lands,
desiring their wealth and treasures,
merging and seizing without end,
ever increasing without cease—
this is the great cause of calamity,
the ultimate source of blame.

No fault is greater than the desire to take.

From ancient times to now,
flying birds and running beasts,
all living things with breath and kind—
none preserve their nature and life
without the desire to take.

Thus, the one who dwells as a ruler becomes a captive,
the one who dwells as a tiger becomes a mouse.
Though their name soars above the green clouds,
their body lies beneath the Yellow Springs.

Those who occupy the station of ox or horse
suffer no ox or horse’s fate;
those who take refuge among dogs and sheep
bear no dogs and sheep’s blame.

Therefore, the lord who attains the Way
establishes his heart in sufficiency,
wanders his mind in stillness,
rejects might and yields to power,
stands alone and dwells in solitude,
abandons all things,
and holds only the numinous in his grasp.
His life preserved, his name honored,
he endures without peril,
and all under Heaven turns to him.
None can resist him.

This is the sufficiency that is always sufficient.

Not stepping beyond the doorstep—
not leaving the door to wander the courtyard—
one knows the households of the world,
knows the people.

Not peering through the window—
there is nothing to gaze upon.
Seeing the Dao of Heaven,
one knows Heaven itself.

The farther one goes from home,
the less one knows—
no sight, no hearing.

Thus, the Sage—meaning the enlightened ruler—
acts without moving yet knows all under Heaven,
sees without looking yet names the Heaven and Earth,
does without doing yet accomplishes through spontaneity.

**The Return to Origins:**
Virtue and power transform,
molding the primal head,
receiving life and nature
from the boundless void,
the mysterious dark—
and from this, all things arise in undifferentiated chaos.

The numinous and the clear interact,
pure and turbid separate,
and the Great Harmony flows
through the vast and open wilds,
the subtle and refined—
and from this, all things are born.

Heaven is round, Earth is square,
humans stand upright, beasts move horizontally,
grasses and trees take root,
fish sink, birds soar,
each thing by its kind,
each kind by its group—
rank and status are fixed,
and from this, fortune and misfortune arise.

From this perspective,
Heaven, Earth, and all beings share the same origin,
the same ancestral source.
Within the four quarters and beyond the cosmos,
all are connected as one body.

Qi transforms and separates,
spreading horizontally and vertically,
divided into two,
judged into five.
Two—Heaven and Earth.
Five—the five colors, the five phases, the five flavors, the five notes.

Some become white or black,
some water or fire,
some sour or salty,
some the metal or wood phases.
Humans and things of the same kind,
male and female—
all these are kin, like brothers.

Though their forms differ and their lands are distant,
their benefits and harms oppose one another,
and the myriad things vary beyond measure.
They return to joy and anger,
to death and life,
their emotions and nature born together,
their minds and intentions in harmony.

How so?
Zhuangzi said:
Within a single body,
all born of the same parents,
the four limbs and nine orifices,
each with its distinct function,
the five viscera and six entrails,
each receiving its own charge—
above and below do not know each other,
inner and outer do not see each other.
The head and feet are Heaven and Earth,
the elbows and knees are the four seas,
the liver and gallbladder are the Hu and Yue,
the eyebrows and eyes are Qi and Chu.

If they did not share the same origin,
if their bodies were separate and distinct,
their movements would not support one another,
their stillness would not await one another—
even the Nine Heavens above and the Yellow Springs below
are insufficient to describe it.

Yet, if the head is afflicted, the feet cannot walk;
if the chest is sick, the mouth cannot speak;
if the heart finds peace, the ears and eyes are keen.
When bending and stretching are harmonious,
when all joints move lightly—
this is because of their shared form.

When the ruler moves nearby,
all things respond from afar;
when things move here,
Heaven and Earth respond there.
They and I respond in kind,
entering and exiting without gates,
coming and going without doors.

Between Heaven and Earth,
within the vast emptiness,
endless and boundless,
all things resonate in kind,
never missing by a hair—
for they are of one body.

Humans know only the unity of their own body,
but do not know that a single realm is always one body.
Humans know that a single realm is one body,
but do not know that all things share one mind.

If all things share one mind,
how can there be separation within it?

Thus, one knows the world without leaving the doorstep.

Therefore, the Sage
does not step beyond the threshold,
ascends to his parents above,
descends to his descendants below,
weighs peril and security, benefit and harm,
returns to the teachings of life and death,
discerns the principles of right and wrong,
penetrates the origins of benefit and harm,
reaches the roots of order and chaos.

Knowing oneself, one knows the family;
knowing the family, one knows others.
Holding fast to the essentials,
grasping the principles,
in action, knowing where to go,
in stillness, knowing what to guard.

Virtue and power are father and mother,
clarity and stillness are teacher,
Great Harmony is friend,
all under Heaven is home,
all things are body.
View others as oneself,
view oneself as others.
The heart dares not stir,
the will dares not rise.
Abandoning old knowledge,
abolishing the three and five.

Acting without contrivance,
dwelling in caves and holes,
not killing living things,
not eating raw plants,
not wearing what is unformed,
not taking what is incomplete—
Heaven, Earth, and all beings
each preserve what is theirs.

Though Heaven, Earth, and all things seem to differ in form,
their beginning and end, their roots and branches,
are all of one body.
Within this unity, there is no resentment or malice.
Received from virtue and power,
how dare they harm or injure?
Thus, Heaven, Earth, and all beings each preserve what is theirs.

Before my form took shape,
the source of my nature and life,
the origin of spirit and breath,
the foundation of my body—
this reveals that the real arises from the void,
that being comes from non-being.
The small void contains nothing,
the great void encompasses all.

My origin lies in virtue and power,
conceived yet unborn,
the means by which form is perfected
until emerging from the dark—
this reveals the profound, the subtle, the refined,
the harmonious, the weak, the moist—
the great through which all things pass,
the unknown, the unknowing,
the doing without doing, the acting without action—
yet its function is great.

Viewing myself as the infant brother,
until I grew strong and knowing,
I saw the soft giving rise to the hard,
the weak to the strong,
the small to the great,
the short to the long,
the foolish to the wise,
the obscure to the clear.

---

Examine my breath’s inhalation and exhalation,
to know that loss is the first of gain,
gain is the root of loss,
advance is the foundation of retreat,
retreat is the root of advance,
fortune is the beginning of calamity,
calamity is the precursor of fortune.

Ascending steep slopes, traversing obstacles and dangers,
my form grows weary, breathless, and trembling—
yet when I rest in stillness,
my spirit becomes even, my *qi* harmonious,
inner and outer preserved in balance—
this is the equilibrium of those who align with the Dao.

Thus I know the great function of
clearing stillness, emptiness, and non-action,
where transformation unfolds.

The four limbs and nine orifices,
pursuing diverse tasks and errands,
with varied abilities and forms—
all arise from the singular origin of mind.
Thus I know that all things, in their myriad directions and forms,
their benefits and harms, all spring from the master.

The master is the origin of all people,
as the heart is to the body.
Examining the heavens and earth,
verifying past and present,
movement never contradicts—
thus I know the Dao of heaven and earth is complete within me.
I differ not from heaven and earth.

Therefore, the family is the root of knowing people;
the body is the source of knowing heaven.
Observe the body to know the body,
observe the family to know the family,
observe the world to know the world.
To observe heaven without the body,
to observe people without the family—
nearness leads to great distance,
small knowledge leads to great confusion.
Abandon the family and step outside—
you see not the world;
abandon the body and peer through a window—
you know not the Dao of heaven.
The farther you go, the less you know;
roaming the four seas, the more you stray.
The more you seek, the smaller your achievements;
the more you pursue fame, the less you attain.

Do not look, do not listen—
seek within yourself.
At the juncture of heaven and humanity,
the great Dao is complete.
Obtain yourself and obtain heaven,
obtain heaven and obtain the Dao,
obtain the Dao and obtain humanity.
Thus, without stepping outside, one knows the world;
without peering through a window, one knows the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.

Therefore, the sage does not observe the likes and dislikes of one family
to command the affairs of ten thousand families;
without traveling a thousand *li*,
he commands the changes of the nine regions.
His feet do not ascend to heaven,
yet he knows the intent of the nine heavens;
his body does not enter the earth,
yet he knows the meaning of the nine depths.
The advance and retreat of yin and yang,
the transformations of the four seasons,
the profound and hidden, the obscure and mysterious—
nothing escapes him.

How so?
By examining the inner to know the outer,
by tracing the small to know the great,
by using myself to understand others,
by clarifying the near to illuminate the distant.

Thus, the sage governs as the heart governs the body,
as the body governs itself.
The heart resides within the body,
yet it does not impose external rules—
only by subtly initiating harmony
do all limbs align in accord.

Not knowing to act in accordance with the Dao,
not desiring to respond to heaven,
acting without action to guide the world,
remaining without doing to nourish the people—
mysterious and silent,
allowing transformation to unfold naturally,
above in harmony with the divine,
below in unity with all things—
moving, they oppose yet sustain;
still, they preserve yet endure.
Empty, tranquil, and secluded,
they let things return to their natural state.

The sage, secluded and without action,
allows all things to naturally conform to the Dao—
like a pearl in water, making the river beautiful,
this is the transmission of divine transformation.
Thus it is said:
the sage speaks not yet is believed,
acts not yet achieves.

Some say the sage, having attained the Dao,
its principle eternally present,
divine transformation ever ongoing—
why, then, do I not practice,
yet naturally align with perfection?
The world grows ever more distant from the Dao.

This fails to grasp the sage’s transformation.
If rain and dew nourish grass and trees,
all flourish with fragrance—
yet withered and dried things remain unchanged.
Can the nature of withered things
absorb the grace of clouds and rain?
Is it not like the blind who do not believe in the light of sun and moon?

*(End of Daoist Canon: *Zhuangzi*’s *Gu Shen Zi* Commentary, Vol. 8–9)*

The pursuit of learning daily increases—
yet learning only increases the people’s knowledge.
The practice of the Dao daily diminishes—
yet diminishing only diminishes the people’s knowledge.

Diminish again, and again—
until they know not at all.
Reach the state of *wuwei*—
until there is no doing,
and thus no undone.
To seek to take the world,
one must first harmonize it—
ever abiding in *wuwei*,
ever without function.

When affairs arise, knowledge and ability are strained—
yet even then, they are insufficient to take the world,
and thus it is never attained.

**Commentary:**
The transformation of virtue and Dao—
shifting, void, and mysterious,
vast and silent,
boundless and formless,
turbulent yet indistinct,
chaotic yet without origin.
It cannot be seen, cannot be heard,
yet opens and guides all things—
nothing is absent from its embrace.
When deeds are accomplished, affairs fulfilled,
nothing is left undone.
*Wuwei* is the root of all things.

From this, we see:
The knowing of the unknown is the origin of knowing;
The teaching of the uninstructed is the source of teaching.
*Wuwei* as action is the beginning of action;
The doing of non-doing is the origin of affairs.
The teaching of the uninstructed,
*wuwei* as action—
all are the supreme movements of the ultimate Dao,
formless yet spiritually complete,
ineffable and nameless,
thus called the Great Origin, the Ancestral Source.

All these things:
The workings of the divine,
The return of heaven and earth,
The teachings of the Mysterious Sage,
The transmission of the recluse.

Yet when benevolence and righteousness grow shallow,
life and nature become false,
the Great Dao is unseen,
actions follow mere desires,
they sink into knowledge’s delusions,
are steeped in sorrow and favor,
their emotions and intentions multiply,
their spirit binds to things,
their schemes are deep yet unheard,
their grand theories clash with truth,
they exalt knowledge over the Dao,
value deeds over virtue.

Thus they devise arts and calculations,
compile words and writings,
record them in texts,
to instruct the people.
They weave the threads of heaven and earth,
measure the patterns of yin and yang,
divide and judge human affairs,
scatter the Ancestral Source,
corrupt simplicity with artifice,
fabricate deceits in all directions,
shift customs, topple norms,
alter rites and clothing—
all things become manifest.

Bells and drums, zithers and se,
flutes and sheng pipes,
ascending and descending,
advancing and retreating,
ornate symbols and soaring rites—
three hundred ceremonies, three thousand decorums.
Disputes arise, conflicts multiply,
affairs flourish, words dance,
they argue to subdue, outwit to triumph—
every hair raised, endlessly so.
This is the daily increase of learning.

Thus the world abandons its root, forsakes its origin,
turns to superficiality, clings to words.
Scholarship deepens, questions multiply—
every household knows, every door holds a sage.
The extreme: they emulate the Sage,
to establish lord and subject.

Those in accord, though powerless, are honored;
those who differ, though great in deed, are destroyed.
The Confucian way embraces love yet breeds factions—
those who align with them,
though wicked, are praised as good;
those who do not,
though virtuous, are condemned as evil.

Thus the world is restless,
unable to tend to their kin,
chasing trivial pursuits,
serving their lords.
They blend the five flavors to nourish their mouths—
rich, fragrant, sweet, and crisp—
yet ignore the suffering of all living things.
They alter the five colors to please their eyes—
deep blacks, bright yellows, delicate hues—
yet do not consider the people’s poverty.
They harmonize the five tones to delight their ears—
perfecting the intricacies of bells and chimes—
yet do not fear the world’s corruption.
They build high towers and vast halls to satisfy their desires—
yet do not dread the people’s exhaustion.
They hunt and ride to sharpen their resolve—
seeking personal gain,
yet defying heaven’s will.
They exploit others’ lives to sustain themselves,
diminish others’ wealth for their own profit—
they do not mourn the world’s plight,
only take what they can.
None of this stems from benevolence and love—
all defy the harmony of heaven and earth.

All these things:
Not done for virtue’s sake,
but to please their lords.

Thus the world abandons sincerity,
feigns virtue, masks deceit,
erodes harmony,
nurtures violence’s roots,
until it becomes custom—
cleverness is prized as wisdom,
the people’s vital essence is drained,
their labor increased,
their natural goodness harmed,
their burdens multiplied.

At such times,
valleys rebel against their rulers,
the seas each crown their own kings.
Titles and power are revered,
strength dictates right,
wrath and contention escalate,
might justifies force—
the strong enslave the weak,
the many dominate the few.
They nurse chaos as governance,
distort truth as policy—
subjects slay their lords,
sons slay their fathers.
The greater the strife,
the fewer who can endure.
Many seek, few attain—
the roads fill with sorrow,
all speak of war.
The wails and groans rise—
until men are boiled alive.

Why does this happen?
Because they adorn words and multiply affairs,
competing to outdo each other.

For learning, the error lies in daily increase.
Thus the Sage abandons virtue and discards righteousness,
returns to the Great Dao,
severs wisdom and rejects teachings,
seeking within oneself.
His words grow ever subtler,
his actions ever fewer.
For the Way is daily diminished.

Fade and vanish it must,
night and day without cease,
enveloped in boundless obscurity,
so the people know no shame.
Destroy all texts, abandon all affairs—
the world will settle of its own accord.
Diminish, diminish again,
until all striving ceases.
Diminish yet again.

Eschew renown, abandon the self,
preserve the vital essence and spirit.
Grasp the essence of virtue and power,
secure the mechanism of life and death.
Neither rule as sovereign,
nor teach as master.
Silent as nonexistence,
arriving at non-action.
To reach the utmost non-being.

Heaven and Earth act spontaneously,
virtue and beauty follow naturally,
all things manifest themselves,
the myriad tribes harmonize,
the common folk wander in bewilderment,
unaware of their path.
Illumination emerges from within,
trusting the four seasons.
The spirit drifts freely,
unbound by the mind’s designs.
The heart is empty within,
like wood floating,
like earth at rest.
They know not virtue nor righteousness,
nor grasp ritual and propriety.
The heart desires nothing,
the will acts without purpose.
Their steps are steady and true,
their gaze lofty and far.
*Shuǎnshuǎn*—honest and direct.
*Diāndiān*—elevated and boundless.
Their speech is silent,
their essence profound.
Externally, they seem like beasts,
yet inwardly, they differ.

Silent yet acting,
as if no rulers exist,
governing without action,
thick with loyalty and sincerity,
until great peace prevails.
The spirit rests, the essence breathes—
life and death preserved intact.
All things follow in succession,
aligned with virtue and power.
To act without acting,
yet nothing remains undone.

Why so?
Because the ruler issues no commands,
and the people hear none.
Thus, to take the world,
one must act through non-action.
Speak not of techniques,
teach through non-teaching.
Desire nothing as treasure,
ignorance as the key.
To act in accordance with the Dao,
nothing remains unopened.

To take the world is to act through non-action.
Release the void, return to reality,
take extremes as substance.
Know the height of Heaven above,
the depth of Earth below.
Discern the division of yin and yang,
grasp the patterns of all things.
By day, see stars in the sky,
by night, fish in the depths.
The ears harmonize with the eight winds,
the eyes perceive the fur of all beasts.
This is the utmost of thought—
yet it profits nothing for survival.
Strength tenfold that of Wu Ge,
might a hundredfold that of Meng Xin,
courage a thousandfold that of Xia Yu,
terror commanding three armies,
advancing like radiant light,
retreating like drifting clouds,
striking like thunder,
unmoving as yin.
This is the peak of power—
yet it profits nothing for victory.

If all beneath Heaven were to wield *The Rites* and *The Changes*,
master *The Odes* and *The Documents*,
understand laws and decrees,
know proclamations and orders,
each household a clerk,
each neighborhood an officer,
each village a granary,
each watchtower a treasury,
sharp in judgment, strict in punishment,
strong in suppressing bandits—
the people would stand with heavy feet,
glance with sidelong eyes,
fathers and sons would betray one another,
brothers would harbor no trust.
This is the extreme of governance—
yet it profits nothing for order.

Thus, to know what is known is to separate from Heaven,
to act is to oppose Heaven’s intent,
to act in affairs is to lose Heaven’s purpose.
Daily increase in governance
brings a hundred flaws to fruition.
Acting yet failing to achieve,
seeking yet never attaining—
the world descends into chaos,
ending in disorder.
This is called: when affairs arise,
they are insufficient to take the world—
thus, disorder follows.

**The Sage has no fixed heart.**
The Sage’s heart is formless,
for the Sage takes the people’s heart as their own.
To the virtuous, I am virtuous—
extending their clarity.
To the unvirtuous, I too am virtuous—
transforming their nature.
Thus virtue is attained,
and harmony is restored.
To the trustworthy, I am trustworthy—
extending their sincerity.
To the untrustworthy, I too am trustworthy—
transforming their emotions.
Thus trust is attained,
and peace is restored.

The Sage in the world—
the Emperor—
*Wǎnwǎn*—his heart is empty.
For the world, his heart is vast,
embracing all directions.
The people gaze with their ears and eyes,
but the Sage follows only the Dao.
**Pointers:**
Virtue and power are formless yet rule all beneath Heaven—
the heart without heart exists.
Heaven and Earth act without action yet all things comply—
the thought without thought operates.

From this, it is seen:
The heart without heart is the master of the heart.
Non-use is the mother of use.

How to clarify this?
Zhuangzi said:
*"What I use to be myself—
am I truly myself?
Even my body is not myself.
I am like my body,
yet my body is not myself.
What my body uses to be itself—
it is because I exist.
Because I distinguish,
I am called ‘body,’
yet I do not call myself so.
What I use to be myself—
it is because of the spirit.
What the spirit uses to retain me—
the Dao makes it so.
The Dao generates the spirit,
the spirit generates the body.
Body and spirit unite,
and I am called ‘I.’
I am not myself through the body,
so my body does not belong to itself through me.
I am not myself through the spirit,
so the body and spirit are one.
The Dao, though not having, has—
this is the heart without heart.
Relying on the Dao’s method,
preserving the spirit’s way,
stillness and purity as foundation,
emptiness and nothingness as constant—
this cannot be achieved by heart or intent,
nor realized by thought or deliberation.

Thus, the wise dwell thus:
ears and eyes see and hear,
mind and thought deliberate,
meals and rest follow their time,
fulfilling desires to their utmost.
Cleverness and insight surge without end,
day and night without pause,
experiencing myriad paths,
planning ten thousand affairs,
determining the beginnings of safety and peril,
clarifying the roads of retreat and advance,
aiming to preserve the body and prolong life.

Yet thus,
the spirit is diminished,
the vital essence decayed,
the soul and vital breath scattered—
life and death are cut short.
They strive for their bodies,
yet do not know that thought harms the body.
When they sleep,
mind and intent are idle,
hearing and sight sealed,
thought and deliberation cease,
neither eating nor drinking,
the spirit harmonized,
the vital essence at ease,
the heart finds rest,
the body free of ailments.

When calamity and harm befall,
great sores erupt as rashes,
broken bones are set and bound,
every joint and orifice
fulfills its natural desire.

Yet even in slumber,
one still finds fleeting peace—
how much more so when
one embodies the Dao and forgets the self,
ever at ease.

For with a single body,
to abandon thought is to turn peril into safety,
to employ thought is to risk losing what is secure—
how much more so for those
who uphold virtue and Dao,
align with the numinous and bright,
follow Heaven’s intent,
and nurture all living beings?

Nurturing all living beings
requires above all a tranquil mind.

Thus, the Sage establishes
a body without a body,
a heart without a heart,
a presence within absence,
a trust in what is not stored—
above, encompassing the transformation of virtue and Dao,
below, embracing the hearts of all people.

The Sage has no heart,
yet takes the hearts of the people as their own.

Neither hating nor loving,
neither favoring nor rejecting,
not feuding with the wicked,
not befriending the fortunate,
not consorting with the sincere,
not resenting the deceitful.

Bearing them as the earth bears all,
covering them as Heaven does,
illuminating them as the sun,
transforming them as the numinous.

For humanity’s delusion
has endured for ages.
To suddenly make the unvirtuous virtuous—
how could it be so swift?

One must first comfort and soften them,
let them seek it themselves,
immerse and moisten them,
let them find it themselves—
only then may their clarity grow,
their sincerity take root,
their desires align,
their hearts transform.

Thus it is said:
bear them as the earth bears all,
cover them as Heaven does,
illuminate them as the sun,
transform them as the numinous.

Whether great or small,
all things are viewed as the self.
Act before action begins,
govern before disorder arises,
cutting off misfortune at its source,
awakening fortune from its origin.

Block gradual corruption,
prevent evil’s sprouting,
suppress vice and promote virtue.

Abandon my desires,
take what brings the people ease;
abandon my scheming,
return to what is natural.

Let nature allow all things to find ease,
so the people live unaware in their daily lives.

Move them with harmony,
guide them with spontaneity,
above containing the intent of virtue and Dao,
below attaining the heart of the numinous and bright,
illuminating Heaven and Earth,
connecting virtue to all people.

The people bear no burdens,
the ruler holds no grievances,
all find their true nature,
all retain their vital essence.
Seeing nothing, hearing nothing,
forgetting their refined thoughts,
taking the ruler as their heart.

When the ruler embodies the Dao,
covering people with the Way,
the people receive the ruler’s grace
as if it were their own.

Their hearts follow the ruler,
like children returning to their mother.
Bowing, rising, resting, waking—
all move as if in a marketplace.

With them in bowing and rising,
with them in floating and sinking,
following their external stirrings,
releasing their flexing and bending—
without speaking, the world responds;
without acting, all things endure.
Within the four seas,
no commands are given,
yet all transform their hearts.

The virtuous reach great virtue,
their clarity deepening daily.
The wicked’s nature shifts,
gradually becoming serene.

So-called unvirtuous—
I also treat them with virtue,
thus they attain virtue.

The trustworthy become utterly trustworthy,
reaching beyond self-interest.
The deceitful’s nature transforms,
daily approaching sincerity.

The untrustworthy—
I also treat them with trust,
thus they attain trust.

The cruel and destructive return to virtue,
the deceitful return to truth.
Virtue and vice, trust and doubt—
all return to their natural state.

The reason the Way repeatedly returns to nature
is that the ultimate Dao stands independent and profound,
existing since antiquity.
Its power acts upon all things,
yet all things cannot act upon it—
thus it is called *natural*.

Not that insects and birds
are the ultimate measure.

Those who embody this natural Dao
can harmonize with the dust of the world,
stand without sharp edges,
let things transform of their own accord,
all returning to virtue.
Advancing their singular will,
as if by nature’s own impulse.

As the Sage says:
*"Without speaking, I nourish people with harmony."*

At such times,
the world is submerged in boundless unity,
drenched in supreme harmony.
The people forget their thoughts,
lost in a daze of floating ease,
losing what they hated,
gaining what they sought,
moving with Heaven,
flowing with the Dao—
not driven by coercion to abandon vice,
not bound by teaching to change.

Through *wuwei*, transformation occurs unknowingly.

Why is this so?
The ruler’s transformation
is empty, still, and silent,
like withered wood,
the heart like a hollowed gourd,
the will like the sea,
actions like valleys—
not distinguishing east and west,
not separating south and north,
not judging sweet and bitter,
not favoring white and black,
not enforcing square or round,
not fixing straight or crooked,
delving into the mysterious,
striving to remain hidden.

As the Sage says:
*"Awakened, awakened—
for all under Heaven, I muddle their hearts."*

Without governing things,
floating without end,
abandoning what I would do,
embracing what Heaven would gain,
all things in tumult—
all pour into their ears and eyes.

As the Sage says:
*"The people all pour into their ears and eyes."*

The ruler’s *wuwei*
is serene, composed—
Heaven and Earth as the furnace,
Great Harmony as the bellows,
the numinous as the wind,
all things as the iron,
virtue as the master craftsman,
the Dao as the work—
the world verdant and lush,
nothing left unmoistened.

The Sage contains such transformative power,
thus able to benefit all things endlessly.

Thus can they mold the people’s hearts,
transform the customs of the age,
above encompassing all,
below conquering all,
perfecting all things,
nothing left unmeasured,
stirring all living beings,
shaking the eight extremes.

The world is vast and indistinct,
unaware of good and evil,
darkly effective, obscure in form,
self-forming in law.

The Sage stirs all things,
returning them to the Dao,
following what is fitting to establish law.

**出生入死章**
**Birth and Death**

Birth and death,
abandoning *wuwei*.

Those who cling to life—thirteen types—
are heavy with false vitality.
Those who cling to death—thirteen types—
are burdened with excess.
Yet the people live their lives,
driven to death’s edge for profit and name—
thirteen types cling to strength.

Why is this so?
Because their obsession with life
destroys their very life.

**Chapter on Birth and Death**

Birth and death,
abandon *wuwei* [non-action].

Those who cultivate life—thirteen types—
are **empty** [虚], **without** [无], **pure** [清], **serene** [静],
**subtle** [微], **sparse** [寡], **soft** [柔],
**weak** [弱], **lowly** [卑], **self-effacing** [损],
**timely** [时], **harmonious** [和], **restrained** [啬]—
these thirteen are the **Birth** [生] types.

These thirteen,
are the **Dao/Way’s** [道] beginnings,
the **abode of the spirit** [神明].
Hence, they are called the **Birth** [生] types.

Those who cling to death—thirteen types—
are **solid** [实], **excessive** [有], **impure** [浊],
**turbulent** [扰], **manifest** [显], **abundant** [众],
**hard** [刚], **forceful** [强], **elevated** [高],
**full** [满], **extreme** [过], **profligate** [泰],
**exhaustive** [费]—
these thirteen are the **Death** [死] types.

These thirteen,
contradict the **Dao/Way** [道],
oppose the **spirit** [神].
Hence, they are called the **Death** [死] types.

Why is this so?
The **Sage’s Dao/Way** [圣人之道],
in motion has its **root** [因],
in stillness has its **response** [应].
The four limbs and nine orifices—
these thirteen are the **external** [外] **apparatus** [具] of life and death.

The matters of **emptiness** [虚] and **solidity** [实],
the changes of **hardness** [刚] and **softness** [柔],
are the **internal** [内] **counts** [数] of life and death.
Thus, thirteen are spoken of in total.

Because within are thirteen **Birth** [生] types,
and without are the four limbs and nine orifices,
thus they are spoken of as **internal** [内] and **external** [外].

---

The adept at preserving life
nurtures the **spirit** [神明].
On land, he avoids neither **rhinoceros** [兕] nor **tiger** [虎],
yet the tiger does not harm him.
Entering battle, he wears no armor nor wields weapons,
yet weapons do not strike him.

The **rhinoceros** [兕] has no place to lodge its horn—
his **body** [体] is **soft** [柔弱].
The **tiger** [虎] has no place to strike its claws—
his **form** [形] is **harmonious** [和平].
Weapons have no place to lodge their blades—
his **essence** [精] is **unharmed** [害亡中].

Why is this so?
Because **forms** [形] resonate with their kind.
He has no **place of death** [死地], no **form of loss** [亡形].
Thus, **returning to the Dao/Way** [指归]:
**Virtue/Power** [德] and **Dao/Way** [道],
**spirit** [神明], **purity** [清] and **impurity** [浊],
**Great Harmony** [太和] all **mixed** [浑同],
sinking to become **substance** [体].
All things take **form** [形] from it.

Where **form** [形] takes root,
it thrives with **luster** [英英] and **honor** [荣荣],
yet no **mark** [字] is seen.
It is called **Birth** [生].

**Birth** [生] as a **phenomenon** [物],
is neither **yin** [阴] nor **yang** [阳],
cannot be **measured** [揆度] nor **gauged** [测量],
too **profound** [深微] to be named,
too **mysterious** [玄妙] to be described.
Its **radiance** [光] is **dazzling** [耀] yet **flickering** [恍惚],
without **form** [形] or **sound** [声],
without **appearance** [状] or **image** [象].
Its **movement** [动] and **stillness** [静] have no **fixed principle** [方].
It wanders in the **wild of emptiness** [虚寂],
dwells in the **land of nonexistence** [无有].
Those who attain it **survive** [存],
those who lose it **perish** [亡].

Where the **Dao/Way’s qi** [道气] is transmitted,
**yin** [阴] and **yang** [阳] harmonize,
congealing to form **awareness** [识],
called **Birth** [生].
Yet it is neither **form** [形] nor **image** [象],
neither **yin** [阴] nor **yang** [阳].
Hence, it is said: neither **yin** [阴] nor **yang** [阳],
dwelling in the **land of nonexistence** [无有].

**Birth** [生] in relation to **form** [形],
the **spirit** [神] is its **bud** [蒂],
**essence** [精] is its **root** [根],
**vitality** [营] and **refinement** [爽] are its **palace** [宫室],
the **nine orifices** [九窍] are its **gates** [户门],
**clarity** [聪] and **intelligence** [明] are its **ministers** [侯使],
**desires** [情] and **intentions** [意] are its **carriage** [乘舆],
**soul** [魂] and **spirit** [魄] are its **attendants** [左右],
**blood** [血] and **qi** [气] are its **soldiers** [卒徒].

Advancing, he aligns with the **Dao/Way** [道],
retreating, he conforms to **virtue/power** [德].
He neither departs from nor opposes **virtue/power** [德] and **Dao/Way** [道].

Soaring and gliding in **softness** [柔弱],
resting in **emptiness** [虚无],
bending and stretching, bowing and rising,
harmonizing with the **times** [时] as they unfold.

To **lightly regard death** [轻死] is to **contradict** [反] it,
to **desire life** [欲生] is to **be its enemy** [仇].
If there is no **use** [利], it cannot be **pursued** [去],
if there is **use** [用], it cannot be **retained** [留].

To **abandon non-action** [无为] is to let **Birth** [生] arise naturally,
thus he does not **pursue non-action** [去无为].
To **desire life** [欲生] is to **invite death** [死],
thus he does not **retain it** [留].
Hence, **non-action** [无为] is the **home of Birth** [生],
while **action** [有为] is the **house of Death** [死].

To stand is to **forget one’s body** [遗其身],
to sit is to **forget one’s mind** [忘其心],
**plain as an infant** [澹如赤子],
**tranquil as formless** [泊如无形],
neither seeing nor hearing,
neither doing nor speaking.
**Transformation** [变化] and **subtle shifts** [消息]
are without **constancy** [常].
With the **Dao/Way** he bows and rises,
with **virtue/power** [德] he floats and sinks,
with the **spirit** [神] he merges in **substance** [体],
with **Harmony** [和] he bends and stretches.

He does not **debase himself for things** [贱为物],
nor **exalt himself as a man** [贵为人].
His **interests** [利] differ from those of **kings and nobles** [王侯],
his **sufferings** [患] are unlike those of the **common folk** [万姓].
**Death** [死] and **Birth** [生] are one,
thus he does not **distinguish survival and perishing** [别存亡].
This is the **non-action** [无为] of **self-cultivation** [治身].

Spring **gives rise** [生], summer **grows long** [长],
autumn **harvests** [收], winter **conceals** [藏].
He **serves the sovereign’s law** [奉主之法],
**follows Heaven’s command** [顺天之命],
**cherishes his parents within** [内慈父母],
**rejects fame and profit without** [外绝名利].
He neither **plans** [思] nor **ponder** [虑],
neither **competes** [与] nor **demands** [求].
Coming and going alone,
his **body** [体] is **harmonious** [和],
his **conduct** [袭] is **natural** [顺].
He **submits to others in speech** [辞让於入],
does not **contend with the times** [与时争].
This is the **non-action** [无为] of **household governance** [治家].

He **honors Heaven** [尊天] and **respects Earth** [敬地],
does not **dare to abandon the ancestors** [亡先].
He **cultivates himself** [修身] and **rectifies the law** [正法],
**discards self** [去己] and **trusts others** [任人].
He **verifies reality** [审实] and **establishes names** [定名],
**follows things** [顺物] and **harmonizes the spirit** [和神].
He **consults his ministers** [参伍左右],
**connects front and rear** [前后相连].
He **adapts to the times** [随时] and **follows principle** [循理],
**bends to what is fitting** [曲因其当].
All things **act in concert** [并作],
returning to **nature** [自然].
This is the **non-action** [无为] of **state governance** [治国].

**Crownless** [冠无有], **cloaked in formlessness** [被无形],
**embracing emptiness** [抱空虚], **treading Heaven and Earth** [履天地],
**galloping yin and yang** [驰阴阳], **ranging the Five Phases** [骋五行],
**following all things** [从群物], **wandering in the Mysterious** [涉玄冥],
**playing in the realm of no effort** [游乎无功],
**returning to the land of no name** [归乎无名].
This is the **non-action** [无为] of **governing all under Heaven** [治天下].

All who practice **non-action** [无为] are **Birth** [生] types.

Greedy for life and **longevity** [利寿],
fearing they may not attain it,
they **forcefully suppress** [强藏] their **heart** [心] and **intentions** [意],
**close off** [闭塞] their **ears** [耳] and **eyes** [目].
They **guide and lead** [导引] their **steps** [步],
**agitate** [动摇] their **hundred joints** [百节].
They **expel the old** [吐故] and **intake the new** [纳新],
**blow warmly** [吹煦] and **breathe deeply** [呼吸].
They **adorn themselves with the Five Stars** [被服五星],
**nourish with the Sun and Moon** [饮食日月].
Their **form** [形] and **spirit** [神] both **act** [作],
yet they **never rest** [休息].
This is the **action** [有为] of **self-cultivation** [治身].

They **neglect Heaven’s timing** [废释天时],
**solely rely on human affairs** [独任人事].
They **debase themselves** [贱强] to **pursue nobility** [求贵],
**poverty** [贫] to **pursue wealth** [求富].
They **name hunger** [饥名] and **call thirst power** [渴势],
their **heart** [心] is always **laden with seeking** [载求].
Their **clothing** [衣] and **food** [食] are **luxurious and extravagant** [奢泰],
their **undertakings** [事] exceed their **capacity** [务].
This is the **action** [有为] of **household governance** [治家].

They **amass lands** [兼壤] for their **wealthy state** [富国],
**lightly wage war** [轻战] and **take pleasure in arms** [乐兵].
They **establish threats** [底威] and **raise banners** [起节],
their **name** [名] is **displayed** [显], their **power** [势] is **exalted** [隆].
Their **punishments** [刑] are **severe** [严], their **penalties** [罚] are **harsh** [峻],
**rigid** [峭直] and **deeply engraved** [刻深].
Their **laws** [法] are **fine-meshed** [网周], their **governance** [察] is **poisonous** [操毒],
**sparse in kindness** [少恩].
The **feudal lords** [诸侯] **fear and revile** [畏忌] them,
they are **often hailed as heroes** [俊雄].
They **pursue the title of Marquis** [公强求伯],
**Marquis** [伯] to **King** [王].
This is the **action** [有为] of **state governance** [治国].

They **cherish ancestral and filial piety** [祖孝悌],
**uphold benevolence and righteousness** [宗仁义],
**refine rituals and propriety** [修礼节],
**teach the people to adorn themselves** [教民知饰].
They **cultivate** [修治] **colors** [色] and **flavors** [味]
to **please the people’s hearts** [以顺民心].
They **employ bells and drums** [钟鼓], **lutes and zithers** [琴瑟]
to **harmonize the people’s wills** [以和民志].
The **sovereign speaks** [主言], the **ministers listen** [臣听],
the **sovereign moves** [主动], the **ministers follow** [臣随].
They **display achievements** [表功] and **exert force** [厉行],
**opening with kindness** [开以恩厚],
**proclaiming orders with splendor** [号令声华],
**making the people cling** [使民亲附].
They **undertake all affairs themselves** [诸事任己],
**rely on the people in all matters** [百方仰朝].
This is the **action** [有为] of **governing all under Heaven** [治天下].

All who practice **action** [有为] are **Death** [死] types.

Hence, the thirteen **Birth** [生] types—
**emptiness** [虚], **without** [无], **purity** [清], **serenity** [静],
**subtlety** [微], **sparseness** [寡], **softness** [柔], **weakness** [弱],
**lowliness** [卑], **self-effacement** [损], **timeliness** [时],
**harmony** [和], **restraint** [啬]—
are the **Dao/Way’s** [道] beginnings,
the **abode of the spirit** [神].
Thus they are called the **Birth** [生] types.

The thirteen **Death** [死] types—
**solidity** [实], **excess** [有], **impurity** [浊],
**turbulence** [扰], **manifestness** [显], **abundance** [众],
**hardness** [刚], **strength** [强], **elevation** [高],
**fullness** [满], **excess** [过], **profligacy** [泰],
**exhaustion** [费]—
contradict the **Dao/Way** [道],
oppose the **spirit** [神].
Thus they are called the **Death** [死] types.

Why is this so?
The **Sage’s Dao/Way** [圣人之道],
in motion has its **root** [因],
in stillness has its **response** [应].
The four limbs and nine orifices—
these thirteen are the **external** [外] **apparatus** [具] of life and death.

The matters of **emptiness** [虚] and **solidity** [实],
the changes of **hardness** [刚] and **softness** [柔],
are the **internal** [内] **

The **void** [虚] gives rise to **fullness** [充] and **solidity** [实],
**emptiness** [无] sustains **constancy** [常存];
**clarity** [清] brings **acuity** [聪] and **penetration** [达],
**stillness** [静] yields **inner luminosity** [内明].

**Subtlety** [微] generates **magnificence** [章] and **manifestness** [显],
**sparseness** [寡] produces **abundance** [众];
**softness** [柔] begets **hardness** [刚] and **robustness** [健],
**weakness** [弱] fosters **firmness** [坚] and **strength** [强].

**Lowliness** [卑] engenders **elevation** [高],
**depletion** [损] spawns **advantage** [益];
**timeliness** [时] ensures **permeation** [通] and **reach** [达],
**harmony** [和] achieves **moderation** [中].

**Frugality** [啬] results in **excess** [余]—
this is called **augmenting life** [益生].

Those who practice this **Dao/Way** [道],
align with **Heaven and Earth** [天地],
endure long in **the body** [为身],
prosper far in **the realm** [为国].
Though they wish otherwise,
**Creation** [造化] does not comply.

For **emptiness** [虚] and **voidness** [无] are **clarity** [清] and **stillness** [静],
and if one seeks to **unify with the Dao/Way** [合道],
they can give rise to **all things** [诸有].
Thus, though they wish otherwise,
**Creation** [造化] does not permit it.

**Solidity** [实] produces **emptiness** [空] and **voidness** [虚],
**excess** [有] leads to **consumption** [消] and **extinction** [亡];
**impurity** [浊] causes **obstruction** [塞] and **deafness** [听],
**turbulence** [扰] brings **loss of luminosity** [失明].

**Manifestness** [显] reverts to **subtlety** [微],
**abundance** [众] returns to **sparseness** [寡],
**hardness** [刚] yields **softness** [柔] and **flexibility** [韧],
**strength** [强] generates **weakness** [弱] and **calamity** [殃].

**Elevation** [高] descends to **lowliness** [卑] and **abasement** [贱],
**fullness** [满] leads to **depletion** [损] and **emptiness** [空];
**profligacy** [泰] invites **constraint** [困] and **poverty** [穷],
**exhaustion** [费] beckons **misfortune** [祸].

These thirteen—
they are the **burdens** [累] of **form** [形],
the **roots** [元] of **disaster** [祸].
Thus, when one acts in accordance with them,
they drive one to **extremity** [穷].

In **the body** [为身], they bring **short-lived endurance** [不久],
in **the realm** [为国], they cause **instability** [不平].
Though one wishes otherwise,
**Heaven and Earth** [天地] do not obey.

**Action** [有为] must meet **defeat** [败],
**natural law** [理数] is immutable—
thus **Heaven and Earth** [天地] do not comply.

Yet the people all cherish their **life** [生] and **augment it** [益] without ceasing,
all love their **bodies** [身] and **favor them** [爱] without end.
Their **movements** [动] lead to **action** [有为],
their **scheming** [智虑] constantly arises.

**Human existence** [人之生],
is the **path to Death** [动之死地].

Thus they **forsake emptiness** [虚] for **solidity** [实],
**abandon voidness** [无] for **dependence** [依有],
**leave clarity** [清] for **impurity** [浊],
**turn from stillness** [静] to **turbulence** [扰].

They **change subtlety** [微] into **manifestness** [显],
**transform sparseness** [寡] into **abundance** [众],
**reject softness** [柔] for **hardness** [刚],
**discard weakness** [弱] to **exalt strength** [强].

They **abandon lowliness** [卑] for **elevation** [高],
**forsake depletion** [损] for **fullness** [满],
**indulge excess** [过] and **create profligacy** [泰],
**release moderation** [和] to **pursue extravagance** [泰].

They **act with intent** [有为],
**discard frugality** [啬] to **spend wastefully** [施费].

Why is this so?
They **possess their bodies** [有其身] yet **forget the Dao/Way of life** [忘生之道].

「They are called the disciples of death.

Thus, the practitioners of **life mastery** [摄生], with their lofty and boundless Dao/Way, stand apart in grandness and transcend the mundane, soaring far beyond the world’s constraints. They do not cling to the **customs of the masses** [俗], nor are they bound by the **affairs of the world** [世]. They diminish their **form** [形] in the **boundless** [无境], and let their **spirit** [神] drift in the **void** [无内]. They do not regard life as gain, nor death as harm. Their **comprehensive cultivation** [兼施] knows no limits—all things, great or small, are seen as the self, with neither aversion nor attachment. Their **spirit and virtue/power** [精神隆盛] are vast and harmonious, their blessings and **virtue/power** [福德] converge naturally. The Dao/Way is their central sovereign, its radiance visible without. In accordance with **natural transformations** [自然之变], they respond effortlessly—nothing in heaven, earth, or all things can defeat them.

When they walk on land, **rhino-beasts and tigers** [兕虎] cannot harm them; when they enter battle, the **five weapons** [五兵] cannot wound them. No added strength can conquer them, nor can any thrown force subdue them—**their spirit and qi** [神气] are in perfect accord, and the intent to harm is already nullified within.

For those skilled in **life mastery** [摄生], their actions are such that, with no love or hate for all things, they view each thing as if it were their own body. Thus, all things respond in kind, returning affection without malice, as **natural law** [理数] must.

Like shadows following form, it is not by **skill or technique** [法术] that they manipulate form, but by its inherent nature.

Why is this so?
Because **sounds echo in response** [声响相应], and **things follow their kind** [物从其类]. **Rhino-beasts and tigers** [兕虎] cannot harm the **formless** [无形], and the **five weapons** [五兵] cannot strike the **void of substance** [无质]. The practitioners of **life mastery** [摄生] have already extinguished the **thief’s or harmer’s intent** [贼害之心] within, and the **forms of death and injury** [死伤之形] vanish without.

Thus, **tigers have no place to set their claws** [虎无所措其爪], and **weapons find no opening for their blades** [兵无所容其刃], for they possess **no ground of death** [无死地]—this truth is not hollow.

**Dao/Way generates brilliance** [道生章]
The **inherent nature** [禀] of things born from the Dao/Way,
The **virtue/power** [德] bestowed that grants life to all things.
The **forms** [物形] of all things vary in every direction,
The **fulfillment of effort** [势成] that completes their shapes.

Thus, all things attain life through this,
And those who **honor the Dao/Way and value virtue/power** [尊道贵德] are like **sages and worthies** [视宗正].
The Dao/Way is honored, virtue/power is valued—**grand and flourishing** [高大盛].
None can confer titles upon it, for its name is **constant naturalness** [常自然].
The Dao/Way’s **generation of life** [道生] leaves nothing unborn,
Its **virtue/power’s nurturing** [德畜] leaves nothing incomplete.
It **lengthens** [长] without fail,
It **nourishes** [育] without rest,
It **completes** [成] without end,
It **ripens** [熟] without error,
It **sustains** [养] without harm,
It **covers** [覆] without concealment.

To **give birth without possession** [生而不有] is to do so without **hoarding** [赀],
To **act without reliance** [为而不恃] is to do so without **intent** [所为].
To **lengthen without slaughter** [长而不宰] is to do so without **purpose** [以为].
This is called the **mysterious virtue/power** [玄德], which **virtue/power does not know** [德不知].

**Pointing to the return** [指归]:
The **sage’s wisdom** [圣知] unfolds—
Not from the **heavens and earth** [天下],
Nor by **earthly means** [地出],
But **inherent within the body** [内在於身],
And **manifest in all things** [外在於物].
Guided by **natural law** [自然], it permeates without limit.
Following **patterns and effects** [因循效象], it is inexhaustible.

Thus, the Dao/Way is **formless** [虚], virtue/power is **voidless** [无],
Yet they do not lose their **heart** [心].
Heaven is **exalted** [尊], earth is **lowly** [卑],
Yet they do not violate their **principles** [节].

Why?
Because **knowing arises from the void** [有知无],
And **human discernment follows things** [由人识物].
Things of the same **kind** [类], when **voidless** [无], give rise to **possession** [有];
The **formless** [虚] generates the **solid** [实].
To **perceive subtlety and know its manifestation** [见微知着],
To **observe beginnings and foresee endings** [观始睹卒],
Is not a matter of **clever skill** [巧能],
But the **natural workings of things** [自然之物], which the **sage follows** [圣人因之],
In **harmony with heaven** [与天周密].

Thus, **knowing the Dao/Way through its ultimate formlessness** [太虚之虚],
They **draw from nothingness** [无所不禀].
This is the **inherent nature of things** [物性].

**Understanding virtue/power through its supreme voidlessness** [至无之无],
They **bestow without limit** [无所不授].
This is the **granting of life** [授物命].

The Dao/Way **acts without possession** [无为之为],
Its **manifestation** [品] in all directions has no **beginning** [首].
To **act without possession** [为而不有].

Virtue/power **sets without attachment** [无设之设],
It **fulfills the forms of all things** [遂万物之形] without **doing** [事].
To **complete without claiming** [成功不居].

Thus, they can **refine life and destiny** [陶性命],
**Regulate feelings and thoughts** [治情意],
**Shape resolve and cravings** [造志欲],
And **transform all affairs** [化万事].

What are **life, nature, feelings, thoughts, resolve, and cravings** [性命情意志欲]?
Ask of the **differences among these six** [六者之差].

That which is **inherited from the Dao/Way** [所禀於道] and forms **body and shape** [成形体],
Varies in every direction—**all things and beings** [人物],
**Male and female** [男女], **sage’s contemplation and bold daring** [圣虑、勇怯],
**Small and great, long and short** [小大、修短],
**Kindness and meanness, greed and cruelty** [仁廉、贪酷],
**Strength and weakness, lightness and heaviness** [强弱、轻重],
**Sounds and colors, appearance and substance** [声色、状貌],
**Refinement and coarseness, high and low** [精粗、高下]—
This is called **nature** [性].
All this is **inherited from the Dao/Way** [禀於道],
Arises from within, and **never changes** [终焉不变].

That which is **bestowed by virtue/power** [所授於德],
Riches and poverty, **early death and longevity, suffering and joy** [夭寿苦乐],
Some encounters are **fitting**, others **unfitting** [有宜不宜]—
This is called **heavenly destiny** [天命].
All this is **received from virtue/power** [受於德],
Comes from without, and **progress or retreat is in my hands** [进退由我].

To **meet with rulers and parents** [遭遇君父],
The **movements of heaven and earth** [天地之动],
To **encounter fortune or misfortune** [逆顺昌衰],
To **face life or death** [存亡及我]—
This is called **encountered destiny** [遭命].
It is **fortuitous** [偶然], not **fixed** [非常定].

When **all things are arranged** [万物陈列],
And I **undertake affairs** [将有事],
To **deploy or abandon** [举错废置],
To **take or leave, approach or withdraw** [取舍去就],
When **auspicious or inauspicious events come** [吉凶来],
When **calamity or fortune arrives** [祸福至]—
This is called **following destiny** [随命].
It is **obtained by my actions** [随我所为].

To **move from nature and destiny** [因性而动],
To **interact with things and awaken** [接物感寤],
To **love or hate, like or dislike** [爱恶、好憎],
To **startle or fear, rejoice or anger** [惊恐、喜怒],
To **grieve or delight, worry or rage** [悲乐、忧恚],
To **advance or retreat, take or give** [进退、取与]—
This is called **feelings** [情].
They arise from **nature** [性], and come **unconsciously** [不觉而至].

To **act from destiny** [因命而动],
To **generate thought and deliberation** [生思虑],
To **establish plans and strategies** [定计谋],
To **judge safety and peril** [决安危],
To **understand all affairs** [通万事],
To **discern right and wrong** [明是非],
To **differentiate the same and the different** [别同异]—
This is called **thought** [意].
It moves **along with destiny** [缘命], and is **by my doing** [由我所为].

To **stem from feelings and thoughts** [因於情意],
To **move outward and connect with things** [动而之外],
To **always find delight** [与物相连，常有所悦],
To **summon fortune or misfortune** [招麾祸福],
To **accomplish fame and achievement** [功名所遂]—
This is called **resolve** [志].
The **movement of nature and destiny** [性命之动] leads to **feelings and thoughts** [情意],
And from these, **resolve is strengthened** [因而自强].

To **align with nature and destiny** [顺性命],
To **fit with feelings and thoughts** [适情意],
To **be drawn by diverse kinds** [牵於殊类],
To **be bound by all affairs** [系於万事],
To **form attachments that are hard to untie** [结而难解]—
This is called **craving** [欲].
Though **craving arises from feelings and thoughts** [出乎情意],
It **exceeds nature and destiny** [侈於性命],
And **must not be indulged** [不可纵].

All these six—**nature, destiny, feelings, thoughts, resolve, and craving** [性命情意志欲]—
Are **rooted in virtue/power and the Dao/Way** [原道德],
And **thousandfold transformations** [千变万化] know no end.
Only those who **hear of virtue/power and the Dao/Way** [闻道德者] can follow their **principles** [则].

The **Dao/Way is the principle** [则], and **those who attain the principle** [得本者]
Move freely in **advance and retreat**, unshackled by **feelings and cravings** [情欲].

**Nature is refined, destiny is high** [性精命高],
It can be **transformed or altered** [可变可易].
**Nature is coarse, destiny is low** [性粗命下],
It can be **diminished or enhanced** [可损可益].
If one **grasps the root and principle** [得根本],
They are not **stuck in possession or void** [滞有无].

Thus, **heaven, earth, and all beings** [天地人物] contain **heart and core** [含心包核],
Belonging to their **kind** [有类].
They **obtain the Dao/Way to be born** [得道以生],
Yet the Dao/Way **does not possess their virtue/power** [而道不有其德].
The Dao/Way **generates life** [道生], yet **does not claim it** [未有].」

The **One** attained brings completion,
Yet the **One** does not seek its own fortune.
All things honor and revere it,
Cherish and worry over it,
Yet it never repays their virtue/power.
Attaining the completion of the **One**,
The **One** requires no thanks—
This is called *"when principle reaches its utmost, opposites vanish."*

Why is this so?
The **Dao/Way** is lofty and its virtue/power vast,
Deep beyond words—
Things cannot enrich it,
Titles cannot exalt it.
It acts without doing,
Yet all things act through it.
It is not forced by anything,
Yet nature remains ever spontaneous.

It acts without acting toward things,
Yet things act through it without contrivance—
Principle and law move as they must,
Not compelled by things to do so.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** as a thing:
Looked upon, it has no door,
Examined, it has no gate,
Probed, it has no form,
Mapped, it has no shape.
Mind cannot exhaust it,
Speech cannot convey it.
All things are born through it,
Yet it is not diminished by them.
All things return to it,
Yet it is not filled by them.

Above and below, it knows no end,
Broad and vast without boundary.
Ebbing and flowing, curving and bending—
Its measure cannot be fathomed.
It plays in the autumn hair’s breadth,
Yet is not deemed small;
It encompasses all heavens,
Yet is not deemed great.
Its radiance shines like emerald and purple,
Yet it does not alter its resolve.
In darkness and decay,
It does not change its nature—
This is called **constancy**.

It moves without exertion,
Holds no favorites.
It bestows nature and destiny,
Yet does nothing in particular.

Its virtue/power flows through all things,
Yet cannot be reclaimed;
Its grace binds and its blessings endure,
Yet cannot be returned.
**Dao/Way** and virtue/power lend and give birth,
Like the sound of a *tuóluò* flute—
Qi issues forth endlessly,
Never to be recovered.

It gazes upon all under heaven without depletion,
Achieves and completes without exhaustion.
Toward all things, does it merely give life?
It shapes them, establishes them, arranges them into ranks,
Stops them to perfect them,
Ends them to begin anew,
Leads them to follow or precede.

Like water to fish—
Life, form, beginning, and end,
Never parting for an instant.
It both follows and precedes,
With spirit dwelling within,
Great Harmony preserved.
The clear ascends to accumulate,
The turbid descends to congeal.
Heaven is round through it,
Earth is square through it.
Yin finds its yin,
Yang finds its yang.
Sun and moon shine through it,
Stars move through it.
The four seasons transform through it,
The Five Phases overcome one another through it.

Fire burns through it,
Water chills through it.
Grasses and trees bend through it,
Metals and stones harden through it.
Flavors are sweet or bitter through it,
Colors are dark or bright through it.
Sounds rise or fall through it,
Changes stretch or contract through it.
Mountains and hills stagnate through it,
Winds and rains move through it.
Scaled creatures swim through it,
Feathered creatures fly through it.
Beasts run through it,
Humans gain wisdom through it.
Diverse kinds and races all exist through it,
Yet perish when they oppose its transformations.

All heavens differ in form,
Waters and lands vary in shape,
Customs clash, benefits and harms diverge,
Appearance and desire are deceptive,
Intentions and cravings are incomprehensible.
Even yin and yang cannot reach them,
Sun and moon cannot illuminate them—
All begin and end through it.

Opening the mouth, stretching the eyes,
Bending, tilting, bowing, or rising—
In the space of a breath,
In the space of inhaling and exhaling,
Where spirit traverses,
Where mind and intention dwell,
Where love and attraction take hold,
Where male and female transform—
It guides all things,
Does all things,
Gives life without claiming reward,
Acts without demanding return,
Nurtures without possession.

All under heaven is bewildered,
None can know it.
Dark and silent, formless and empty,
Yet it gives birth and completes—
Not like the boundless void,
For long has humanity been deluded,
Thus they do not recognize it.

Some say:
**"Dao/Way** is the divine mystery of heaven and earth;
Heaven and earth are the manifestation of **Dao/Way**."

Others claim:
**"Dao/Way** is the function of heaven and earth,
Heaven and earth are the substance of **Dao/Way**."
This is the shortsightedness of a gnat in a jar,
The limited wisdom of lice in clothing—
Unfit to speak of the **Dao/Way**.

How may this be made clear?
**Dao/Way** encompasses all heavens.
Zhuangzi said:
*"Heaven and earth have their kinds,
Yet **Dao/Way** has no form.
Things with kinds all have limits,
Things without form know no end.*
To entrust the limited to the boundless
Is like grasses and trees torn from the earth,
Or stars torn from the sky—
Insufficient to illustrate it.

Yet to say otherwise
Is to fail to grasp
How having and not-having embrace,
How emptiness and reality contain each other—
Like the rind of a gourd,
Unaware of the tendrils’ neighboring growth,
Or lice hiding in fur,
Unaware of the multitude in the city.

Thus, beyond the cosmos yet within its domain,
Unconstrained by any prohibition,
Bound by no regulation—
Safety and peril, ebb and flow,
Know no inside or outside.
All follow the same wind,
Point in the same direction,
Harmonious and obedient to its decree,
Perfect and unblemished,
Without flaw or ruin.
Ten thousand blessings abound—
**Dao/Way** covers them all.
Its deeds are mysterious, its work hidden,
Unrevealed to the world.
All under heaven sees it not,
Yet it never ceases to act.

It responds without being seen—
If seen, it is not true.
Its constant speech never reaches,
Its extraordinary nature cannot be recognized.
This is called **mysterious virtue/power**,
Virtue/power that aids without end.

---
**The Beginning of All Under Heaven**
All under heaven has a **beginning**—
A **non-doing body** that is the mother of all things,
The root of ten thousand beings.
Having obtained its mother,
It holds to spontaneity—
Thus it knows its offspring:
All things arise without intervention.
Having known its offspring,
It never strays—
Thus it returns to its mother,
Reverting to its origin.
Death does not bring peril,
Life ends in tranquility.

Seal its senses—
Eyes and ears are darkened,
Its doors and openings are closed—
No speech all its life,
No toil or labor—
This is ease.

Open its senses—
Ears and eyes are sharp,
Its affairs are accomplished,
Its fame and deeds are manifest—
Yet its life is unsalvageable.

Seeing the small is called **clarity**—
Perceiving what has not yet sprouted.
Holding to softness is called **strength**—
Harmony as constancy.

Using its light—
Spirit moves outward,
Returning to its clarity—
Spirit moves inward.
No harm befalls the body—
This is not greatness,
But donning the **Dao/Way’s** ordinary garb,
Following its decrees.

---
**Pointing to the Return:**
The **Dao/Way** as a thing—
Formless, shapeless,
Without mind or intention,
Yet never forgets or ponders,
Without knowledge or awareness,
Without head or direction,
Without action or deed,
Empty, insubstantial, serene and still,
Vague, hazy, pure and tranquil.

「Its transformations unfold—
Change within the unchanging,
Motion within the still,
Returning to give birth to cover,
Covering to return to give birth,
Having to birth nothingness,
Nothingness to birth having,
Return and cover interwoven,
Naturally holding fast—
Acting without action, all things flourish,
Not acting yet all things succeed.

Thus, the **Dao/Way’s** embodiment of *wuwei* (無為),
Is the origin of heaven and earth.
So it is said, "Heaven and earth have a beginning."

*Wuwei* is subtle and profound,
Encompassing all in secrecy;
Smooth and tranquil, yet nothing escapes its sway.
Life and growth are keen and bright,
Skillful and discerning—
Reaching all corners, yet none remain untouched.
Therefore, it is said: "The origin of all things,
Is the mother of ten thousand affairs."
This is the mother of all under heaven.

The sage attains it,
And reverses with all things.
Having obtained its child,
Thus able to grasp the **Dao/Way’s** essence,
To penetrate heaven’s principles,
To birth as its origin,
To open the gate of affairs,
To harness all knowledge of ten thousand realms,
To exhaust the tongues of the multitude,
To exhaust the cunning of divergent schools,
To drain the arts of a hundred families.

All knowledge of ten thousand realms,
The arts of a hundred families,
All spring from the **Dao/Way**, hence called its child.
Attaining the **Dao/Way’s** perfect harmony,
Not only does one cultivate virtue alone,
But responds to every situation with effortless skill—
Wondrous uses without measure.
Without measure in its use,
It guides all things back to the **Dao/Way**,
Hence it is said: "Having known its child,
One again guards its mother."

Moreover, the **Dao/Way** adapts to human affairs,
Turning with the times’ transformations,
Nurturing and refining it,
Ending to begin anew,
Sudden in its changes,
Penetrating spirits, commanding ghosts,
Manifest in the formless,
No matter unaddressed,
Exhausting the inexhaustible,
Reaching the unreachable—
Yet through it all, one carves and refines,
Returning to guard its mother.

Return and guard its mother,
The root of all under heaven,
Roaming in the mysterious depths,
A lifetime without peril.
Perishing yet without peril.

Thus the sage can:
Plug his ears to preserve clarity,
Close his eyes to preserve insight,
Silence speech to preserve virtue,
Abandon deeds to preserve efficacy—
Hearing without listening aligns with heaven’s acuity,
Seeing without gazing aligns with heaven’s brilliance,
Transforming without words aligns with heaven’s **virtue/power** (德),
Acting without striving aligns with heaven’s function.

What is guarded is essential,
What is cultivated is thorough.
The **Dao/Way’s** luminous virtue is never obscured,
And heaven and earth’s concerns are fully realized.

Thus one can echo and shadow,
Illumine without end,
As the origin of blessings,
As the ancestor of transformations—
Flowing through all, permeating the great middle,
Things follow in accord, the world without toil.
The **Dao/Way’s** use is never exhausted,
Like echoes and shadows to form and sound—
Thus a lifetime without toil.

Therefore, straining eyes harms clarity,
Forcing ears harms acuity,
Hasty speech undermines virtue,
Cunning deceit ruins efficacy.
Thus, with mouth wide open,
Eyes and ears stretched taut,
Knowledge and perception arise,
All things multiply and thrive,
Stirring the heart, raising thoughts—
Fame and deeds are accomplished.
Fame and deeds accomplished,
Calamity arrives, blessings end,
Motion triggers the **Heavenly Net** (羅天網),
Stillness invites the **Earthly Retribution** (地殃),
Spirits and **Dao/Way** cannot aid,
Creation cannot sustain—
Common folk lose their lives,
States perish in ruin.

Opening its senses,
Accomplishing its affairs,
Not embodying the **Dao/Way** yet acting—
Thus its life is unsalvageable.

Hence the sage withdraws from deeds,
Abandons affairs,
Embodies the **Dao/Way’s** heart,
Follows **virtue/power** (德) with intention,
Unites the boundless mechanisms,
Holds the essentials of nature—
Soaring before the origin,
Gathering in the profound,
Clarity acts as if unheard,
Insight as if unseen,
Sprouts and seeds undisturbed,
The subtle threads uncut—
Brightly perceiving alone,
The changes of the formless,
Penetrating the unexpressed,
Reaching the limitless—
Not even the slightest evil can arise,
Not even the greatest calamity can approach.
Seeing the small is called **clarity**—
Thus evil ceases, good prevails.

Acting and refining,
Cutting off speech, extinguishing thought,
Accumulating softness, embodying weakness,
Returning to the state of no awareness—
Punishing violence, aiding the few,
Aligning with the divine transformations,
The unconquerable is conquered,
The unattainable is achieved,
Strength cannot be added,
All under heaven cannot scheme.
Holding to softness is called **strength**.

Governing people, managing things,
In harmony with yin and yang,
Internally using its light,
Yet externally causing no offense—
Clothing, food, tilling, and harvest,
Silk weaving with abundance,
Blessings accumulate, misfortunes dissolve,
People are provided, households are supported,
The heart does not bear the weight of seeking,
The humble do not aspire to the noble,
The poor do not envy the rich,
The refined honor simplicity,
Within and without, nothing is excessive—
Serving above, nourishing below,
Human ways fully realized.

Using its external light,
Returning to its internal **clarity**,
Returning to its internal **clarity**—
Spirit and insight are never depleted,
Stored like a coiled serpent, firmly held,
Daring not to call it wisdom.

---」

「Like the great rivers and seas sharing the same purpose as Heaven,
To extinguish the **Three Five**—
To harm them with affairs,
To fill and block them,
So they cannot be discerned.

As **malaria** and **deafness**,
In harmony with Heaven and Earth,
As **mysterious** and **silent**,
Exhausting the Dao,
Departing leaves no blame,
Defying calamities and ruining bandits,
Floating **virtue** laden with peace—
Nothing it cannot overcome.

Because it does not leave the body to suffer.

Thus, when a person enters the Dao,
The Dao also enters the person,
Our Dao merging within—
Submerged and unified as one.

Preserving stillness to attain **emptiness**,
I become the Dao’s dwelling,
With all things in their natural state,
Chaotic yet complete in every detail,
Returning to the origin, to the beginning—
The Dao covers me like a robe.

A robe—
Layer upon layer.

Merging with the **constant Dao** in **virtue/power**,
Like piling garments upon the body,
Hence it is said the Dao covers me,
This is the **constant Dao** that envelops me.

In the chapter *Conducting the Great Dao*:

It is I who, with knowledge and clarity,
Conduct myself in the Great Dao—
Refining the **constant Dao**,
Only fearing **Shi** lest I stumble and fall.

The Great Dao is vast and smooth,
Easy and level—
Yet people prefer narrow paths,
Delight in reckless action.

Morning is pristine, yet palaces are adorned with excess,
Fields are overgrown with weeds and pests,
Granaries are empty, agriculture neglected,
Garments flash with five colors,
Swords are worn for slaughter,
Feasts are indulged in gluttony and drunkenness,
Wealth is hoarded like mountains,
All treasures compared to a sovereign’s.

This is called **plundering, boasting, and hoarding**—
A perversion of the Dao,
A rebellion against Heaven.

**Pointing to return**:
The Dao’s **virtue/power** is not a matter of cleverness,
Thus it can mold Heaven and Earth,
Shape yin and yang,
And Heaven and Earth cannot deceive it.

Heaven and Earth do not rely on cleverness,
Thus they contain and release transformations,
Kill and give life to all beings,
And all things cannot escape them.

If the Dao **releases** and **returns** to cleverness,
Then the body cannot preserve itself,
And how could Heaven and Earth be shaped,
Or yin and yang be realized?

If Heaven and Earth **release** and **return** to cleverness,
Then the body cannot sustain itself,
And how could transformations be embraced,
Or all things be fully nurtured?

This so-called **naturalness**,
Like water naturally moistening below,
Fire naturally blazing upward—
Within their inherent nature,
It is not a matter of contrivance.

Thus, **emptiness** and **non-action**,
**non-knowledge** and **non-desire**—
The heart of **virtue/power** and the intent of Heaven and Earth.

**Clarity** and **stillness** mirroring the **form**,
**Non-action** responding to circumstances—
The movement of **virtue/power** and the transformation of Heaven and Earth.

**Virtue/power** responds to circumstances,
Heaven and Earth move and transform—
Like images within a mirror,
Echoes in empty space—
This is no difficult matter.

How does one know this?
Zhuangzi said:
*"What the Dao produces, Heaven nurtures,
Beginning without beginning,
Giving life without giving life,
Preserving without preserving,
Destroying without destroying.
That which has no beginning, no giving life,
No preserving, no destroying—
This is the origin of **virtue/power**.*

All these things,
Are the **verifications** of naturalness,
The **constants** of transformation.

Thus, when a person’s actions do not align with the Dao,
The Dao does not favor them;
When they do not align with **virtue/power**,
**Virtue/power** does not aid them;
When they do not align with Heaven,
Heaven does not shelter them;
When they do not align with Earth,
Earth does not bear them.

What the Dao does not favor,
What **virtue/power** does not aid,
What Heaven does not shelter,
What Earth does not bear—
This is where calamities linger,
And blessings never draw near.

People draw **qi** from **virtue/power**,
Take form from Heaven and Earth—
If their actions do not align with the Dao,
They naturally find no peace,
Thus blessings recede daily,
And misfortunes approach.

Therefore, the **mysterious sages** and **recluses**,
Bearing the Dao and embracing its **completeness**,
Lifting **insight** and grasping **clarity**,
Aligning with the Dao and honoring **virtue/power**,
Discarding cleverness and abandoning the body,
Grasping their resolve with dread,
Only fearing to stumble and fall.

Thus they strive for **cleverness** that is not clever,
Pursue **clarity** that is not clear,
Trust in softness and weakness,
Tilling the land for their sustenance,
Ever content with moderation,
Returning to the **nameless**,
Trembling with fear,
Lest they lose **naturalness**,
And their misfortunes extend to Heaven and Earth,
Affecting all people.

Those who, with knowledge and clarity,
Conduct themselves in the Great Dao—
Only fear **Shi**.

Thus auspicious responses and blessings arrive,
Like shadows following form,
Echoes answering sound,
Without expectation or prearrangement,
Arising as if born together—
Hence the Great Dao is vast and smooth,
Its transformation formless,
Like something distant yet near,
Like something dim yet bright.

Simple and vast without blemish,
Concise yet easy to follow,
Achieving success without contrivance,
Attaining blessings without effort—
Heaven and Earth follow it,
And all things come to life from it.

The Great Dao is vast and smooth.

Yet people turn away from it,
Using their cleverness,
Embracing deceit and neglecting the Dao,
Reversing Earth and defying Heaven,
Exalting knowledge and valuing cleverness,
Cheating spirits and mocking gods,
Adorning false governance with perversion,
Pursuing deceit while abandoning truth,
Inventing customs and altering institutions,
Creating affairs and accomplishing deeds.

People delight in narrow paths.

Palaces are grand, gates towering high,
Adorned with bizarre embellishments,
Layered with colorful patterns—
Cleverness as their foundation,
Cunning as their measure.

Morning is pristine, yet deception is their axe,
Falsehood is their adze—
Wielding schemes and manipulating numbers,
Weaving fine cloth while exploiting labor,
Neglecting fields, letting weeds and pests flourish,
Harvests failing, granaries empty.

Fields are overgrown, granaries are empty.

Garments flash with five colors,
Silks and brocades in dark yellows,
Fine linen and delicate embroidery,
Smooth as deer, radiant as phoenixes.

Wearing garments of five colors.

Sharp blades and sturdy armor,
Mighty crossbows and powerful bows,
Light chariots and swift steeds,
Many reckless and fierce warriors.

Wealth is heavy, status honored,
Power and influence prevail—
Slaughtering without restraint,
Subjugating the common folk,
Jealous of the upright, resentful of the generous,
Hating loyalty, poisoning trust,
Binding with evil, joining with falsehood,
Harming the good, nurturing enmity,
Valuing contention and martial prowess—
None they do not oppress,
Forcing borders to expand,
Ever plotting to assassinate rulers.

Wearing swords of slaughter.

Feasts overflow with five flavors,
Pests swarm in abundance,
Cutting into wombs, killing unborn—
A defiance of Heaven’s intent,
Ever drunk and gluttonous,
Taking without restraint.

Indulging in food and drink.

Hoarding gold and jade,
Piling wealth like mountains—
All treasures compared to a sovereign’s.»

Excess in wealth and goods.
Strange and wondrous comings and goings,
Honor and splendor radiant and bright,
Detached from the masses, severed from custom,
Standing alone in tumultuous times,
Praised as a great sage—
This is called **theft of glory**.

Exceeding the crowd in vice, great in evil,
Crimes heavy, calamities deep,
The virtuous father does not rear them,
The enlightened ruler does not employ them,
The Dao does not favor them,
The spirits do not dwell with them,
Heaven does not shelter them,
All things hold them in hatred.

If one is thus,
To lose them is to invite calamity,
To keep them is to invite ruin,
Their bodies unprotected,
Their misfortunes extending to descendants—
All through un-Dao ways.

**On Establishing Virtue Properly**
Those who establish well do not falter—
They stand firm through the Dao.
Those who embrace well do not slip—
They hold fast through virtue.
Their descendants’ sacrifices never cease—
The world knows no end.

Cultivated in the self, its virtue becomes true—
**Nurturing life and breath.**
Cultivated in the family, it governs kindness and abundance—
Its virtue overflows, benefiting kin.
Cultivated in the village, it orders roles and duties—
Its virtue endures, conquering all.
Cultivated in the state, it establishes laws and norms—
Its virtue flourishes, free from slander and treachery.
Cultivated in the world, it sets standards and models—
Its virtue is universal, all under heaven in service.

Thus, by observing the self, one knows other selves,
By observing the family, one knows other families,
By observing the village, one knows other villages,
By observing the state, one knows other states,
By observing the world, one knows the world—
Near and far revealed.

How do I know this to be true?
By seeking it within oneself.

**The Principle of Return:**
Between Heaven and Earth, vast and boundless,
Diverse winds and customs, myriad creatures great and small,
Endless transformations, benefits and harms deceitfully entwined—
Thus, the able cannot control the unable,
And the unable cannot act where the able cannot.

I act for the world, yet the world also acts for me.
When I and it meet, if I am few and it many,
To meet many with few—
The many grow secure, the few grow perilous.

Thus, if one establishes by strength, others will seize it;
If one establishes by cunning, others will counter it;
If one establishes by force, others will threaten it.
Only by doing nothing can one not be defeated.

How does this manifest?
Silent, yet seeking echoes—
Echoes do not answer me.
Trusting shadow to follow shade—
Shadow does not follow me.
Yet fearing echoes, I strike the bell—
Echoes answer louder than before.
Hating shadows, I stand in the sun—
Shadows cling to me more fiercely.

From this, it is clear:
Non-action cannot evade blessing,
Action cannot escape misfortune.

Thus, the sage abandons strength,
Abandons cunning,
Abandons knowledge,
Abandons virtue—
Establishes the Dao, embraces virtue,
Harbors essence, nurtures spirit,
Harmonizes the body, follows weakness,
Steps upon the Earth, bears Heaven.
**This is the unshaken foundation.**

Empty, still, and quiet,
As if absent yet present,
Inner and outer both silent,
Transforming in the Mysterious,
Doing nothing, yet nothing undone,
Returning to simplicity, embracing truth,
Without laws or measures,
Yet aligned with transformation.

**This is the unbroken embrace.**

Nurturing the small to sustain the great,
Tending the myriad people,
Ordering square and round, precedence and sequence,
Ever abiding with the body,
Upright in form, serene in spirit,
Transmitting lineage to descendants.
Descendants’ sacrifices never cease.

Virtue accumulates, transforming and flowing,
Endless, ebbing and swelling with Heaven.
Cultivated in the self, its virtue is true—
**Life’s vitality thrives, the body light and strong,**
Beauty enduring yet untamed.

Cultivated in the family,
Husbands trustworthy, wives chaste,
Fathers merciful, children filial,
Brothers obedient, younger siblings respectful,
Nine clans harmonious and affectionate,
Farming and silk-reeling timely,
Storehouses abundant,
Livestock thriving,
Affairs prosperous, wealth ever sufficient,
Neighbors envy their fortune.

Cultivated in the family, its virtue overflows.

Cultivated in the village,
Clear distinctions in governance,
Actions aligned with harmony,
Names and realities correct,
Black and white distinct,
Curved and straight in their nature,
Right and wrong self-evident,
No deceit arises,
Authority revered and displayed,
Orders enforced without obstruction,
Above transforming, below responding,
Public and private as father and child,
Respect and love sincere,
Superior and inferior in joy,
People united, officials without grievance,
Duties fulfilled, reputation honored,
Called *junzi*, virtue ever abundant,
Death not a peril.

Cultivated in the village, its virtue endures.

Cultivated in the state,
The ruler enlightened, ministers loyal,
No blocking of the worthy in court,
No jealousy of merit among scholars,
No obstruction of the upright by the crooked,
No slander harming the public,
Harmony and compliance above and below,
No grievances, officials delighted in their duties,
All affairs in natural order,
Distant peoples drawn in longing,
The world follows its wind,
The state rich, the people flourishing,
Borders secure without conquest,
Ancestral temples honored,
Altars and fields eternally at peace,
Yin and Yang eternally united,
No calamities arise,
All things bountiful and ripe,
The realm at great ease,
Neighbors entrust their lives,
Posterity thrives,
Virtue and Dao abundant,
Ever as Heaven’s constant.

Cultivated in the state, its virtue is exalted.

Cultivated in the world,
The ruler yin, ministers yang,
The ruler still, ministers active,
The ruler round, ministers square,
The ruler follows, ministers respond,
The ruler silent, ministers speak.
Upright and fair, harmonious and unified,
Easy and effortless, quiet and soundless,
Virtue spreads like whispers,
Spirit transmits like currents,
Movement without origin,
Transformation like Heaven,
Acting without action,
Achieving without doing,
Merit aligned with the Dao,
The world returns to truth,
No affairs, no worries,
Great Peace spontaneously arises.

Cultivated in the world, its virtue is universal.

Thus, my self is the measure of other selves,
My family the balance of other families,
My village the compass of other villages,
My state the standard of other states—
This is the meaning of:
Observing the self to know other selves,
Observing the family to know other families,
Observing the village to know other villages,
Observing the state to know other states,
Observing the world to know the world—
Near and far revealed.

The ruler is the vital core of the land;
The land is the form of the ruler.

Thus, the land and the ruler share prosperity and suffering,
Share corruption and rectitude.
When the people thrive, the land flourishes;
When the ruler is whole, the land is whole.
Families and states preserve each other,
Rulers sustain one another.
If one attains self-mastery, the land naturally follows.

Therefore, those who can know me know all;
Those who can govern me govern all;
What benefits me benefits all;
What suits me suits all.
What harms me yet benefits others—
The world knows none such.

This is the meaning of:
*"A single word sufficient for a lifetime’s practice—*
*Is it not perhaps the virtue of *rú*?"*

How do I know the world is thus?
It is by this.
It is by this.

**Chapter on the Profound Depth of Contained Virtue**

The profound depth of contained virtue—
Its body aligns with the Dao’s origin,
Like a babe in its tender, weak, and void state.

Venomous creatures do not sting,
Raptors do not clutch,
Fierce beasts do not seize,
Nor do they add harm—
Its bones are frail, its sinews soft,
Yet its grasp is firm, its hold unyielding.
It knows not the union of male and female,
Yet the Dao’s effortless transformation is complete—
Its essence is the most divine and luminous.

All day it wails, yet its throat never grows hoarse,
Its voice remains in perfect harmony—
The harmony of the Dao is its way.

To know harmony is to know the eternal Dao,
To know the eternal Dao is to be enlightened and discerning—
Life flourishes as a blessed, boundless day,
The heart directs the *qi* to become robust and unshakable—
When things grow strong, they turn decrepit and rigid,
This is called *not* aligning with the Dao—
A fate of calamity and ruin.
To stray from the Dao means an early end to one’s great destiny.

**Explanation of the Way:**
Virtue is void and boundless,
Divine luminosity is tranquil and profound—
Pure, still, and subtly vast,
The Great Harmony flows like water.
Listen to it, and it is silent and empty,
Observe it, and it is formless and easy.
Its limits are without end, its bounds without measure—
Heaven cannot enfold it,
Earth cannot contain it,
The compass cannot make it round,
The square cannot make it square,
Measure cannot measure it,
Yet scales cannot weigh it—
Gold and jade cannot shield it,
Water and fire cannot obstruct or destroy it,
All things fail to grasp it,
Misfortune cannot befall it.

How much more so for those who float and soar,
Who are pure and vast like the primordial chaos—
Their hearts have no dwelling,
Their forms no fixed abode.
Through natural refinement and reception,
They take form from the Ten Thousand Heavens,
All beings receive it—
Nourished and content,
Yet thought cannot grasp it,
Action cannot seize it—
The farther one seeks, the thinner it becomes,
The more one clutches, the more it eludes.
To grasp it is to be caught by it,
To let go is to be released by it.

Only those without desire
Make their bodies its dwelling,
Store it within their hearts—
Thus it is called *containing virtue*.

To align with virtue is to receive virtue—
The depth of contained virtue is profound.
Virtue in a person
Is like a parent’s love for their child—
For all beings, it is like pearls and jade compared to clay and lead.
Parents give birth to me, and this cannot be changed,
Pearls and jade nourish me, and this cannot be discarded.

Thus, the virtuous person
Values their body above all else,
Yet regards the world with lightness—
Like a benevolent father and filial child,
Who would not trade their love for wealth.
The one who cherishes their body
And holds all else in slight regard
Is like a wise merchant,
Who would not exchange pearls and jade for clay and lead.

Their lack of desire is not from hating wealth or loving ease—
The world’s treasures cannot please their heart.
Their embrace of emptiness is not from loving stillness or hating disturbance—
The world’s affairs are not worth their effort.

Why is this so?
Because they hold their own nature as weighty,
And the world as light.

They understand the distinction between weight and light,
They grasp the shifts between profit and harm—
Thus all things cannot enslave them,
Nor can the world deceive them.

Therefore, they do not seek stillness, yet stillness arises,
They do not seek harmony, yet harmony is born,
They do not rest their spirit, yet the spirit finds peace,
They do not cultivate harmony, yet the *qi* becomes balanced.

Thus, they do not listen, yet hear the soundless sound,
They do not look, yet see the formless form,
They do not think, yet discern right and wrong,
They do not ponder, yet reach the realm of unity.

Their spirit permeates Heaven and Earth,
Their virtue follows Yin and Yang—
They do not pray for blessings, yet Heaven and Earth protect them,
They do not shun misfortune, yet calamities and harm depart,
They do not execute, yet all under Heaven fears them,
They do not bestow, yet all under Heaven loves them.

They find joy in a full belly,
Delight in bowing and rising,
Eat coarse grasses yet find it savory,
Drink plain water yet find it sweet.

Beneath towering trees,
Their spirit remains whole,
Within rocky caves,
Their heart ever rejoices—
The poor find joy in their work,
The lowly forget their humility,
In destitution, they meet death with serenity,
In hardship, they forget all danger.
Their deeds match the Earth’s,
Their virtue aligns with Heaven’s—
They return to simplicity, embrace naturalness,
And are like infants once more.

The profound depth of contained virtue
Is likened to the babe in its cradle.

Thus, to establish the body as the foundation of the state,
And to take the babe as the model of governance,
Then the world will honor the Dao and revere virtue,
Each will cherish their own body,
Renown and power will become stains,
All things mere dust—
The greedy will flee titles,
The cruel will turn to benevolence,
Gathering softness and weakness,
Only virtue will be cultivated.

Yet those who create blessings and sow chaos—
How could this ever arise?

It is from aligning with virtue by nature,
No cause for its generation.

Alas, the Dao of Heaven and Earth—
Deep and distant, subtle and refined—
Few can recognize it,
Fewer still can follow it.
Wisdom and insight cannot grasp it,
Only the babe embodies it.

The babe’s nature mirrors virtue—
The babe knows yet does not speak,
Understands yet does not reveal,
Has power yet does not act,
Is skilled yet remains hidden—
Alive yet like death,
Fresh yet like decay—
Acting without action,
Matching the Dao in every detail.

Life that is not life,
A body that is not a body,
Use that is not use,
Hearing that is not hearing—
Without action or affairs,
Without intention or heart,
Not seeking virtue or spirit,
Not accumulating wisdom—
Neither thinking nor pondering,
Nor obstructed by barriers—
Their spirit does not stir,
Their clarity knows no bounds,
Soft yet void, still yet tranquil,
Their souls are at peace.

Joy without seeking joy,
Ease without desiring ease—
They live without wasting their spirit,
They die without lingering regrets.

Thus they can be enveloped by the Dao and contain virtue,
Align with Heaven and Earth—
Then bees and wasps, venomous creatures and snakes,
Will have no will to inflict their stings.
Raptors and fierce beasts
Will have no intent to seize or attack.

Venomous creatures do not sting,
Raptors do not clutch—
Because there is no place for death.
Bones frail, sinews soft,
Yet their grasp is firm and unyielding.
They see not male and female,
Yet Yin and Yang transform them.

Their spirit is full and complete,
All beings unite with them—
Their cries do not grow hoarse,
Their harmony can be called perfect.
Their actions and deeds
Align with the eternal Dao.

To know harmony is to know the eternal.
To hold fast and guard it
Is to be wise and enlightened—
To know the eternal is to be clear.

By nature, they flourish and grow—
When they move, all blessings gather.
Their hearts act in profound mystery,
Their *qi* flows, robust and unyielding—
The heart directs the *qi*, and this is called *strength*—
Without striving, they overcome all.

Without desire, their movements lose nothing.
Naturally open and free, all virtues sprout anew—
Heaven and Earth shower their favor,
While calamity and chaos fade away.

Yet why is this so?
Because they embrace virtue and harmony of spirit,
And preserve the innocence of youth.

When knowledge dawns, they abandon unity for duality,
Discard obscurity for clarity—
Their bodies adorned, their virtue erodes,
The more they know, the deeper their confusion grows.

Thus, they prize the world yet neglect their spirit,
Value fame and power yet scorn their own bodies,
Overthink and overplan, scattering their spirit’s essence,
Rejecting softness, abandoning weakness,
Forcing progress toward rigidity,
Falling into greed, drowning in the pursuit of life,
Opening themselves to peril while blocking all safety.

When strength peaks, decay begins.
Thus, blessings as vast as Heaven and Earth—
You see them yet cannot grasp them;
Disaster strikes like thunder—
You hear it yet cannot avoid it.

They give without receiving,
Daily inviting ruin.
This is called *not aligning with the Dao*.

Act and you reach exhaustion,
Strive and you court destruction—
Cultivating the self, loving the nation,
Yet such devotion brings misfortune.

Offer sacrifices, and Heaven and Earth turn against you;
Pray to spirits, and the gods abandon you.
No fault of fate—
The consequences of actions unfold as they must.

The wise do not speak of their virtue—
The wise do not speak lest they lose focus,
Those who speak do not know—
And lose their lives.

---

To block the senses, dull the ears and eyes,
To close the mouth and door, speak not at all.
To blunt the sharpness of purpose and its direction,
To dissolve the anger of the heart and its thoughts,
To smooth the brightness of appearance without strangeness,
To blend with common garb, unmarked by eccentricity—
This is called *playing with the Dao*, aligning with the mundane.

They cannot be drawn close by love nor pushed away by neglect,
They cannot be gained by benefit nor lost by harm,
They cannot be honored by rank nor humbled by disgrace,
Yet they stand as the most noble and revered under Heaven and Earth.

**Key Principle:**
The Dao has no fixed manifestation,
Virtue no fixed direction,
The spirit no fixed form,
Harmony no fixed appearance—
You gaze upon it yet cannot see,
You listen to it yet cannot hear,
It cannot be foreseen nor touched.

Thus, those who attain the Dao
Perceive it alone, hear it alone,
Act upon it alone, and abide by it alone.

A father cannot pass it to his son,
A subject cannot bestow it upon his lord,
Yet as a mother recognizes her child,
Or a younger brother his elder—
So too, the child recognizes the mother.

This recognition is natural,
Yet its reason cannot be articulated.

The five flavors are in the mouth,
The five tones in the ear—
Yet what is sweet is not sweet,
What is bitter is not bitter,
What is *shang* is not *shang*,
What is *yu* is not *yu*—
Yet the cook Yi and the musician Jiang could distinguish them.

Yet their means of distinction—
The mouth could not speak of it.

Thus, the saying: *"Those who speak do not know, those who know do not speak."*

Hence, the form without form,
Can be seen yet not seen;
The image without image,
Can be imitated yet not declared;
The action without action,
Can be followed yet not described;
The use without use,
Can be practiced yet not transmitted.

Therefore, those who attain the Dao
See it as a child recognizes its parent,
Tread it like the earth,
Wear it like the sky,
Encase it as clothing,
Embody it like the self,
Act with it in rise and fall,
React to external stimuli as if in water,
Bend with the flexing of fortune,
Yet remain steadfast in their own spirit.

Their spirit wanders with transformation,
Their resolve moves with virtue,
Their wisdom acts inwardly,
Yet outwardly they seem deaf and blind.
Their thoughts arise in mystery,
Their demeanor seems mad.

Thus, their mouth cannot speak,
Nor can their intent be made clear—
Like dreaming of being a king,
Standing on the brink of peril,
Joy and sorrow reversed,
The heart alone knows—
Yet upon waking, they cannot convey it to another.

Those who stray from the Dao are not so.
They see only the exterior, not the interior,
Follow the current, yet grasp not the source,
Hold the end, yet exhaust not the root.
They affirm what is not affirmed,
Deny what is not denied.
The superficiality of things,
Is what they affirm as true.

The fundamental truth of the Dao,
Cannot be comprehended by such superficiality.

Thus, the Dao lies in externals,
Not in the self—
The central ruler is undecided,
His defenses are not steadfast,
The heart harbors doubts, the will wavers,
Emotions cling to things,
Wisdom is flashy,
Falsity is mistaken for truth,
He oscillates between affirmation and negation,
Between existence and non-existence,
Harmonious *qi* is easily disturbed—
Like illness in a man,
Vitality leaks, spirit escapes,
He loves speech yet hates silence.
When he speaks, his heart is troubled,
His resolve is distracted,
His wisdom is all outward,
His spirit departs.

His inner voice is spent,
Yet his outer words overflow,
His virtue and power scatter daily,
His self grows ever more distant.
The more he speaks, the less he understands his own perfection,
The more he acts, the less he knows his own virtue.

Thus, those who speak
Are the essentials of opposing the Dao,
The means of straying from virtue,
The craftsmen of defying Heaven,
The instruments of overturning Earth.

Therefore, those who attain the Dao
Diminish their hearing, discard their brightness,
Do not see, do not listen,
As if without sight or sound,
Close their mouths, seal their tongues,
As if they know not speech.

Block their senses,
Close their doors.
Blunt their sharpness,
Release their attachments,
Their will guards nothing,
Their form seems void.

Dissolve their thoughts,
Scatter their worries,
Seem to know nothing,
Yet hide as if alone in existence.
Blunt their sharpness,
Dissolve their anger.

Extinguish disaster at its root,
Return to the *Tai Su* (Great Primordial),
Their appearance is unchanged,
Their dress is unmarked,
They follow Heaven and Earth,
Blend with the common in transformation,
Plunge deep into the Great Dao,
Wander with virtue.

Without words to speak of speech,
Without action to speak of action,
They govern themselves with clarity and stillness,
Respond to the times with harmony and balance,
Merge with the world in undifferentiated chaos,
Align with the common in *playing with the Dao*.

They smooth their brightness,
Blend with the dust.
Seizing the root of all things,
Grasping the foundation of all affairs,
They alone differ from the crowd—
Yet the world knows them not.

They drift through the thresholds of closeness and distance,
Soar through the gates of gain and harm,
Float in the wilds of honor and disgrace,
Steadfastly guard their own spirit,
Vanish into the realm of the formless,
Roam in the land of abandon.

Poverty and lowliness do not shame them,
Wealth and nobility do not flatter them—
They hide when they wish to hide,
They reveal when they wish to reveal.
Even *yin* and *yang* cannot harm or benefit them,
Nor can rulers obscure their clarity.

This is called *playing with the Dao*.
Thus, they cannot be drawn close nor distanced.

They stand unmatched, alone,
Distinct without peer—
Sounds and colors cannot please them,
The five flavors cannot sweeten them,
Ten thousand things cannot contend with them,
Wisdom and strength cannot dispute them.

Without taking nor giving,
Without gaining nor losing,
They close their doors, shut their gates,
Sever the ends, extinguish the threads,
Their spirit and clarity are self-made,
The Dao is their central ruler—
Their movement aligns with transformation,
Their stillness harmonizes with the natural.
When they follow the natural order, they endure.

Abandoned and unrestrained,
They have no fixed form,
No one can precede or follow them—
Thus, those who love them cannot approach,
Those who hate them cannot distance,
Rewards cannot be added,
Taxes cannot be taken,
Rank and honor cannot be elevated,
Poverty and lowliness cannot be imposed.

They have no need of all things,
Thus all things cannot enslave them.
They take no possession of the world,
Thus the world cannot possess them.

This is how they become noble under Heaven.

**The Methods:**
To govern the nation with uprightness and loyalty,
To employ the Dao in warfare with cunning and strategy,
To take the world without action, relying on natural order.

How do I know this is so?
I know it from my own self.

The world abounds with prohibitions, taboos, shame, and contempt for what is ugly and coarse,
Yet the people grow ever poorer, their wealth ever fewer.

When the people are skilled in sharp tools and clever stratagems,
The state becomes increasingly chaotic and deceitful.

Men rely on artifice and elaborate deception,
And strange things proliferate without end.

When laws and decrees are made ever more explicit and traps set ever tighter,
Thieves and bandits multiply, their violence and rebellion increasing.

The Sage’s words declare the **true method of governance**:
If I do not rule with **non-action** (*wuwei*), the people will not transform themselves,
Yet they will gather in harmony and unity.
If I do not govern with **non-interference** (*wushi*), the people will not enrich themselves,
Yet they will have no cravings.
If I favor **stillness** and rule with emptiness and tranquility,
The people will naturally align with proper principle and order.
If I suppress desire and govern by contentment,
The people will return to simplicity and abandon ornamentation.

When governance is **obscured** and **obscured** (*mènmèn*), lacking virtue and power (*fude*),
The people are **docile** and **docile** (*pièpiè*), loyal and steadfast.
When governance is **scrutinizing** and **scrutinizing** (*cháchá*), virtue and power clear,
The people are **cunning** and **cunning** (*quēquē*), knowing how to scheme and grow.

Calamity arises from fortune’s reliance—fortune leans upon calamity to complete it,
Fortune hides within calamity’s guise—calamity lurks to fulfill it.
Who knows where their extremes begin, with no discernible threads?

If there is no **uprightness** (*zhèng*), no **loyalty** (*xìn*) will endure.
**Uprightness** (*zhèng*) inverted becomes **cunning** (*qí*), **cleverness** (*zhì*), and **deceit** (*zhà*) in action.
**Goodness** (*shàn*) inverted becomes **evil** (*yāo*), and **evil omens** (*yāo xiáng*) follow.

Men have long strayed from what is proper and constant—
The source of their prolonged confusion.

**Key Principle**:
The **emotion of virtue** (*dàoqíng*) is constant—**uprightness** (*zhèng*) and **loyalty** (*xìn*) are the norm.
Change and movement, stillness and action—
One arises, the other vanishes.

The **covering** (*fù*) of Heaven and Earth,
The **threads** (*jī*) and **patterns** (*gāng*) of yin and yang,
The **records** (*jì*) and **guidelines** (*lǐ*) of sun and moon,
Nurturing all living beings—
Those who oppose it perish, those who follow it thrive.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth,
Is one yin and one yang,
**Yang-qi** (*yángqì*) governs **virtue/power** (*dé*),
**Yin-qi** (*yīnqì*) governs **punishment** (*xíng*),
Punishment and virtue are contrary,
Yet harmony lies at the center.

Spring brings forth, summer grows,
Autumn harvests, winter conceals—
Ending to begin anew,
Decaying yet rising again,
Yang reaches its end and turns to yin,
Yin reaches its end and turns to yang,
Yin and yang in opposition,
Extending to infinity.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** of kings and the conduct of men,
Is one soft and one hard,
One civil and one martial,
With **central uprightness** (*zhōngzhèng*) as the guiding thread—
Hardness and softness in contrast,
War and virtue intertwined,
War turns to virtue,
Virtue turns to war,
War and virtue safeguarding each other,
Law at the center,
**Numbers** (*shù*) and **principles** (*fǎ*) in harmony,
Thus all can flow freely.

Therefore, the **enlightened kings** and **sage rulers**,
Reduce their desires to empty their minds,
Empty their minds to calm their spirits,
Calm their spirits to grasp the **Dao/Way**,
Gain the **Dao/Way** to rectify their hearts,
Rectify their hearts to cultivate their bodies,
Cultivate their bodies to order their households,
Order their households to establish laws,
Establish laws to clarify names,
Clarify names to govern the state.

This is how they govern the state with **uprightness**.

When the state is **upright** (*zhèngguó*), its **records** (*jì*) are firm,
Its principles clear and discerned,
From the **roots** (*yuán*) to the **origins** (*běn*),
Drawing connections left and right,
Aligning ranks front and back,
Things return to their proper places—
Clarifying names to **cover** reality,
Verifying reality to **supervise** names.

One name, one reality,
Balanced and thorough,
Square and round, straight and curved,
None can stray—
Rewards and punishments applied,
Neither **excessive** (*yáng*) nor **stunted** (*suō*).
Names and reality,
Like moon and sun,
One name **upright** brings prosperity to the state,
One name **deceitful** brings enslavement to the state.

The **secrets** (*mì*) of nurturing the state,
Lie in having no fixed course—
Bending and extending, giving and taking,
All in accordance with the times.
Following disorder, relying on law,
Encountering rebellion, using war,
Guarding peace with the **Dao/Way**,
Embodying **virtue/power** as the norm,
Great and small states meet—
With **uprightness** as their mutual expectation.

If they stray from **uprightness**, transform them,
If they do not comply, restrain them,
If they do not cease, regulate them,
If they do not submit, strike them.

**Understanding** the great state’s **coordination** (*xié*) with the small,
They dare not lightly use war,
Thus they first employ **transformation** and **restraint**,
Only when compliance fails do they resort to regulation and punishment.

If a small state is **pressed** between great states,
Facing a ruler without the **Dao/Way**,
And **uprightness** cannot prevail,
Then leave it—
If leaving is impossible, cede land to it—
If ceding land is impossible, lead the people to flee—
If fleeing is impossible, take up the staff and depart—
If departing is impossible, calamity will reach all the people,
And disaster will fall upon me—
Thus, I must **devise plans** and **scheme**,
For this is where **contention** arises,
And war is born.

I wish to **select generals** and **train soldiers**,
Sharpen arms and fortify defenses,
Stockpile grain and raise ramparts,
Camp and defend myself—
Yet the people suffer exhaustion,
The state becomes hollowed out—
This is how **war** is **initiated**,
And **uprightness** is **invoked**.

If I enter with **uprightness**,
Yet I am few while they are many,
I am weak while they are strong—
Like an egg thrown upon a stone,
I will be the enemy’s victim,
Suffering calamity—
The armies must surely fail,
Soldiers die in wounds,
The **Heavenly intent** (*tiānxīn*) will not be fulfilled,
The ancestral temples will perish—
Below, I lament the people’s fate,
Above, I fear the **heart of Heaven and Earth** (*tiāndìxīn*)—
This is how **strategy** (*quán*) is **activated**,
And **deceit** (*qí*) is **deployed**.

Thus, I **establish** the **plan of opposition** (*fǎnwéng*) and **attraction** (*fùlái*),
Open the **hearts of the people**,
Stimulate the **schemes of the feudal lords**,
Reveal my **virtue/power’s** (*dàodé*) **blessings**,
Illustrate the **assistance of Heaven and Earth**—
To **unify** the hearts of the four seas,
To **harmonize** the intentions of all states.

The people respond to me like echoes,
Neighboring states follow me like shadows,
Birds and beasts take flight with me—
This is how **plans** are **utilized**,
And **deceit** is **executed**.

**Deceit** is **strategy**—
When a small state is **pressed** between great states,
And matters of fleeing or retreat arise,
War cannot be avoided—
Thus **strategy** and **deceit** are **employed**.

**Understanding** that war is an **omen of misfortune**,
Used only when there is no alternative—
I **activate** schemes and **plans**,
To **align** with the people’s expectations—
Heaven and Earth, birds and beasts,
Assist me as my **fortified city** (*chéng*—*cf.* 以浑四海之心，同万国之意，天地鸟兽助我为城),
Thus it is said: *"Employing **deceit** in war."*

Above, **aligning** with the **intention of virtue**,
Below, **harmonizing** with the **heart of Heaven and Earth**,
In **danger**, ensuring **safety**,
In **harm**, safeguarding **benefit**—
Treating the people as one’s own body,
Embodying the **formless form** (*wúxíng zhī xíng*),
Dwelling in the **Great Yin** (*Tài Yīn*),
**Issuing** the **action of non-action** (*wúwéi zhī wéi*),
**Displaying** the **soundless sound** (*wúshēng zhī shēng*),
Distinguishing the **crimes of extinguishing transformation** (*mièhuà zhī zuì*),
Revealing the **labors of defying Heaven** (*nìtiān zhī gōng*),
Manifesting what **Heaven** bestows,
Showing what **Earth** produces.

There are names without reality,
There are realities without names,
Names and reality **contradict**—
Sometimes **upright**, sometimes **tilted**,
Sometimes **flexible**, sometimes **rigid**,
Sometimes **contrary**—
Yet all **converge** in the **mysterious** (*míng*).

**Understanding** the **virtue/power’s** (*dàodé*) **effects**,
Revealing the **transgressions of rebellion** (*bó nì*),
Sometimes **contradicting** names and reality
To **flexibly align** with the **Dao/Way**.

The calamities of Heaven arise spontaneously,
The portents and misfortunes emerge naturally—
Severing father and son,
Cutting off brothers,
Slaying their valiant generals,
Beheading their loyal ministers,
So that all under Heaven harbor resentment,
None sharing a single heart.
Standing alone and unyielding,
Receiving Heaven’s decree of war,
Victory brings great joy,
And the Four Seas find peace—
This is the **highest** use of the **unconventional** (*qí*).

First employing the **Dao/Way**,
Only when it is not followed do the calamities arise—
Thus it is the **highest**.

Soothing the anger of the world,
Gathering those skilled in the **unconventional**,
Ears attuned to distant whispers,
Eyes scanning the horizon,
Scholars roaming freely,
Forming alliances and bonds of kinship,
Life and death transform strangely,
Following the **Dao/Way** to respond to deceit.

Adorning authority and nurturing influence,
To deceive the people with substance;
Spreading rumors and fabricating schemes,
To confuse the enemy;
Using humble words to subdue the lowly,
To close the mind of their lord;
Offering light tasks with heavy rewards,
To open the hearts of their ministers.

When rifts form between lord and subject,
Manipulating their spirits,
Actions concealed in darkness,
Power shifting in subtlety,
Suspending their fate,
Exploiting their vulnerabilities,
Driving the enemy to madness and confusion,
So they cannot act—
Advancing or retreating with the times,
No fixed rituals,
Not striking yet the enemy surrenders,
Not fighting yet the enemy falters,
Overthrowing their lord without harming their ministers,
Slaying their generals without touching their troops,
Victory brings the people’s joy,
The feudal lords fear them—
This is the **second** use of the **unconventional**.

First devising strategies,
Later securing their fate—
Thus it is the **second**.

Controlling the terrain,
Mastering their lords and ministers,
Offering low status with heavy rewards,
To pacify their outward appearance,
Spreading covert schemes,
To sow discord among their kin,
Deceit comes from them,
The **Dao/Way** arises from this—
Granting cities to seal generals,
Joining states to reward deceit.

Deceit arrives like a specter,
Plots unfold like divine foresight,
Strategies unmeasured,
Unconventional shifts endless,
Dividing their strength,
Sowing doubt in their hearts,
As if rising from the earth,
As if born of Heaven,
Severing their inner circle,
Scattering their alliances,
Raising influence and generating change,
To determine their fate,
Blocking their schemes,
So they cannot trust.

Breaking their strong supporters,
To isolate their resolve,
Exploiting their form to ensure victory,
Like an endless ring,
Striking at the opportune moment,
Harmony as its constant,
Attacking their vulnerabilities,
In stillness, cutting their supplies.

Stripping them of resources,
Starving and parching them,
Burdening them with weight,
Drowning them in fire,
Exhausting them with labor,
Freezing and scorching them,
Luring them with profit,
Maddening them with confusion,
Driving them to desperation,
Pressing them to the brink.

Striking from high to low,
Using many to overcome few,
Strengthening ranks and divisions,
Officers and troops aligned,
The high protecting the low,
The low aiding the high,
The three armies united,
Bound as father and son.

**Unconventional** formations merge and split,
Hidden and concealed in layers.
Camps before, supplies behind,
Overwhelming the left, routing the right,
Dazzling with banners and drums,
Confounding with music and war cries,
Advancing like surging waves,
Retreating like wind and rain,
Striking like a collapse,
Clashing like a tiger—
Defenses unbreakable,
Offensives unyielding,
Victory brings awe,
All under Heaven trembles—
This is the **lowest** use of the **unconventional**.

Employing force first,
Only then determining their fate—
Thus it is the **lowest**.

When chaos and disorder cease,
All things flourish in peace,
Heaven’s will is fulfilled,
The world rejoices—
Concealing the **unconventional**, diminishing cleverness,
Prioritizing loyalty and sincerity,
Cultivating stillness and simplicity,
Withdrawing from affairs, halting speech.

Though skilled in unconventional victory,
Unclear in **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,
Fearful that affairs will shift and change,
Corrupting purity, scattering simplicity—
Thus halting speech.

Why is this so?
**Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** transform endlessly,
All things have high and low,
Directions diverge,
Paths intertwine—
Some turn west, some east,
Each follows its nature,
To sustain its life.

The virtuous thrive through goodness,
The wicked spread through evil,
The sincere shine through truth,
The deceitful mask with falsity—
Each displays their wisdom,
To avoid calamity and ruin.

Seeking without fulfillment,
The wise feign cunning;
Laboring without rest,
The loyal turn deceitful;
Oppressed and tormented,
The faithful spread lies;
Driven to ruin without end,
The worthy do not transform.

Thus when the ruler favors knowledge, the people deceive;
When the ruler favors profit, the people suffer;
When the ruler favors rewards, the people grow weary;
When the ruler favors punishment, the people resent.

Why?
Affairs originate with the ruler,
Actions rest with the ministers;
Rewards come from the ruler,
Wealth comes from the people;
Laws come from the ruler,
Obedience rests with the ministers.
When the ruler desires,
All under Heaven follows the wind.

All affairs stem from the ruler,
The ruler is the source of transformation.
If the ruler does not conceal their schemes,
They revert to the **Dao/Way**.

Though clever and wise in strategy,
It is not as effective as acting without thought.
Thus governing with public-mindedness
Is not as harmonious as the great unity of non-action;
Seeking to curb excess through prohibition
Is not as effective as loyalty born of no desire;
Guiding through measured anger
Is not as fruitful as the merit of non-action;
Balancing thought with **virtue/power**
Is not as vast as the boundless flow of inaction;
Mastering the arts of divination and omens
Is not as beneficial as nurturing a world without ailment;
Wielding the strategies of the Yellow Emperor and Duke Zhou,
Or grasping the essentials of Sunzi and Wu Qi,
Is not as profound as letting all under Heaven
Refrain from exerting cleverness or strength.

Thus what **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** produce,
Love cannot profit from;
What Heaven and Earth complete,
Action cannot achieve.

Small acts of love and gain
Ultimately defy the great **Dao/Way** of Heaven.
Only those without love can bring profit,
Only those without action can fulfill.
Thus the enlightened kings and sage rulers
Have no desires, no seeking,
No creation, no contrivance,
No burdens, no formalities—
Returning to origins, embracing simplicity,
All under Heaven finds peace.

Taking the realm through inaction—
How is this made clear?
Zhuangzi said:
*"To bring fortune and benefit,
To achieve success and complete affairs,
To prepare all things and fulfill their use,
To enrich people greatly—
Then all under Heaven indulges in extravagance,
Wealth and goods are insufficient,
The people grow ever more depraved.
Fortune fills the mountains and marshes,
Gold and jade pile up,
Yet the state grows ever less secure,
The people gain less benefit.
Adorning cleverness while appearing foolish,
Using deceit to manipulate,
Guarding against licentiousness and lust,
The paths of deceit and falsity grow dense,
Distinguishing same from different,
The shifts of right and wrong multiply—
Then the state grows dim,
And governance decays."*

The world fears taboos,
Yet the people grow ever poorer.
The more sharp tools they possess,
The more the state descends into chaos.

Crafting schemes and perfecting arts,
Carving and embellishing with ornament,
Strange transformations and monstrous novelty—
To exalt those of virtue,
To distinguish high and low.

Artifice multiplies,
Talents flourish ever more bizarre,
Rewards are swift and deep,
Punishments harsh and laws severe,
Piercing flesh and severing limbs,
Distant kin grow estranged, near kin grow discordant,
Guilt leads to utter annihilation,
Reward leads to knighthood and lordship,
Earth and Heaven tremble—
Yet thieves and bandits multiply.

The people grow skilled in strange cleverness,
Strange things multiply,
Laws and decrees grow ever more elaborate—
Thieves and bandits grow ever more numerous.

Thus the Sage’s words declare:
*"I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves.
Why so?*
The ruler is the heart of all under Heaven.
Qi responds to sensation, the body follows its impulse,
The heart moves, the body obeys,
Sounds echo in resonance, forms shadow in pursuit—
Not enough to illustrate the point.

Therefore, if the ruler truly practices non-action,
Then the hearts of all under Heaven have no direction,
Enveloped by the Dao, containing virtue,
Without thought nor desire,
Without orders nor laws,
The people transform themselves of their own accord.
I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves.

If the ruler truly practices the affairs of non-affairs,
Then all under Heaven lacks effect nor form,
Lacks knowledge nor perception,
No rewards nor gifts given,
The people grow rich of their own accord.
I act with non-affairs, yet the people grow rich.

If the ruler truly practices the stillness of non-stillness,
And the joy of non-clearance,
Then all under Heaven does not study nor inquire,
Hears nothing nor sees nothing,
Has no punishments nor laws,
The people align themselves naturally.
I love stillness, yet the people align themselves.

If the ruler truly practices the desires of non-desire,
Then the hearts of all under Heaven grow empty and their wills level,
Great bodies and small things,
Action yet returning to cessation,
Stillness yet returning to sufficiency—
Without constraint nor regulation,
The people return to simplicity.
I act with non-desire, yet the people return to simplicity.*

Thus, when the ruler’s governance is correct,
There is no filial piety nor benevolence,
No giving nor bestowing,
Yet the people are drawn and swayed,
Mute and docile,
Their likes and dislikes indistinguishable,
Their right and wrong undiscerned—
Thus they obtain what they desire,
And their lives are preserved whole.
His governance is stifling,
And his people are docile.

When the ruler’s governance is probing,
Bestowing virtue and spreading benefit,
Making distinctions clear and keen,
The people are bright and discerning,
All know of calamity and fortune.
Filial piety and brotherly respect,
Benevolence and righteousness,
All affairs are differentiated—
Yet the wise are obscured and the foolish prevail.
His governance is probing,
And his people are obscured.

Thus, he loses what he relies upon,
And his life is cut short by Heaven.
Fortune arises from calamity,
Calamity arises from fortune—
Fortune and calamity,
Share the same source yet different realms,
Both perish together, both endure together,
Different in nature yet the same in appearance,
Following each other in and out,
Same in origin yet different in end.
Without the Sage,
None can grasp them alone.
Fortune and calamity,
Depend upon each other,
Lie in wait for one another.

Thus, to abandon fortune is to abandon calamity,
To abandon calamity is to abandon fortune—
Fortune without fortune,
The most subtle and profound,
Yet all under Heaven loves to know,
None can exhaust its depths.
Who knows its ultimate extent?

Only the non-acting can follow its natural course,
Standing correct between calamity and fortune,
Overcoming all without effort.
This is the true correctness.
To lose correctness is to give rise to strangeness,
Strangeness arises and the people are bewildered,
Good men become malevolent,
Right and wrong invert.

Correctness becomes strangeness,
Goodness becomes malevolence.
All under Heaven is deeply confused and cannot return.

The Dao is very easy to follow,
Yet people’s confusion endures long—
Thus it cannot be recovered.

Rectangular yet not cutting,
Sharp yet not harming,
Straight yet not overbearing,
Bright yet not dazzling.

To govern people and harmonize Heaven for living—
Nothing surpasses frugality and non-action.

Only frugality,
Thus early service without prohibitions.
Accumulating virtue in subtle profundity,
Then there is nothing it cannot overcome,
Nothing it cannot conquer.
None know its ultimate transformation—
Tangtang, it can make a state,
It can make a sovereign king.
The mother of states is frugality,
It can endure long and move with difficulty.

Deep roots and firm stems,
Spirit concealed,
Long life and enduring vision,
The body preserved whole.

Pointing back:
The Dao has nothing it does not possess,
Yet does not give or withhold—
Thus all things exist.
It lacks no power,
Yet does not act or kill—
Thus all things flourish.
How can this be made clear?

The Dao is formless yet all things have form,
It lacks state nor appearance yet all things are square or round,
Silent yet all things have sound.
From this perspective,
The Dao does not give nor withhold,
Yet all things exist;
It does not act nor slaughter,
Yet all things flourish.
Flourishing arises from non-flourishing,
Existence arises from non-existence—
This is clear.
The Dao can preserve in non-preservation,
Flourish in non-flourishing.

Some say:
*"The Dao is formless and soundless,
Yet does not give nor withhold—
How can it flourish in non-flourishing,
Preserve in non-preservation?"*

The Sage discerns each thing in its natural state,
Each thing preserves its own Dao—
This is called recognizing form and sound,
Yet not recognizing their influence.

The sun, though not making form to cast shadow,
Yet shadow must follow sunlight,
The void, though not making sound to produce echo,
Yet echo must follow hollow valleys.
If the sun and void had hearts to create shadows and echoes,
Then there would be times when they fail—
How could they ever be seen nor heard,
Nor ensure that flourishing and preservation must exist?

The Dao can flourish and preserve in things,
Yet the Dao has never had a heart.
Thus, when the king raises troops and uses sharp tools,
The people grow desirous—
Desire grows, and with desire comes cutting.
Cutting as the standard,
Then the licentious advance while the upright retreat,
Loyal ministers suffer its poison,
And all the people bear its harm.

The desirous use desire as the standard,
Yet desire is licentious—
Thus the upright are cut down,
And all the people suffer harm.

To value wealth,
Then the people seek—
Seeking grows, and with seeking comes piercing.
Piercing as the standard,
Then the greedy prevail while the frugal suffer,
Loyal ministers bear the blame,
And all the people suffer defeat.

The seekers use seeking as the standard,
Yet seeking is greedy—
Thus the frugal are pierced,
And piercing brings injury.

When strife is opened, the people bend crookedly—
Bending crookedly, yet the standard is uprightness,
Uprightness then becomes unrestrained.
If unrestraint is taken as uprightness,
Then the perverse soar while the upright lie low,
Loyal ministers bear its calamity,
And all the people suffer its ruin.

When the ruler prizes fame, the people feign—
Feigning, yet the standard is brightness,
Brightness then becomes dazzling.
If dazzling is taken as brightness,
Then great virtue is concealed while petty favors are displayed,
Loyal ministers face death,
And all the people suffer misfortune.
The feigners use feigning as brightness,
Yet brightness is then darkness—
Thus, those who claim brightness are struck by misfortune.

The ruler who rules alone,
While ministers serve with divided loyalty,
Nurtures the ruler’s will,
Flatteringly indulges the ruler’s heart,
Blocks the ruler’s ears,
And veils the ruler’s wisdom—
This is how the state becomes perilous
And the ancestral temples fall into ruin.

Thus, the enlightened kings and sage rulers
Hold alone what they do not share,
Know alone what they do not teach,
Possess alone what they do not employ,
Measure themselves by uprightness yet do not impose it,
Are frugal in all things yet do not hoard,
Cling to natural rectitude yet do not rely on it,
Let their virtue shine universally yet do not haggle over it.

Why so?
Remove desire yet uphold uprightness,
So that the people act justly by themselves;
Pierce not where piercing is not due,
So that the people have no quarrels.
Matters are naturally resolved,
All things flow freely—
None call it fortune, none call it misfortune,
The world drifts in harmony, without fixed norm.
Treasure the Dao in one’s heart,
Be open and magnanimous,
Let things find their own place,
No one knows their limits.

Though not piercing, all things attain their proper form—
This is the piercing that transcends mere cutting,
Not the work of any blade.
Not that there is no cutting—
Pruning the proud, restraining the violent,
Yet leaving no scars or wounds.
Adapting to the times, conforming to nature,
Ruler and people are as one—
Though cutting, it is not injury.

Remove wealth yet uphold frugality,
So that the world naturally balances;
Pierce not where piercing is not due,
So that people have no disputes.
The greedy and grasping cease,
Purity and honesty arise—
None call it turbid, none call it clear,
Reputation is not falsely conferred,
Truth is not misrepresented.
Not that there is no piercing—
Practicing virtue, beauty, and humility,
Exposing flaws and manifesting vice,
Yet debate is without deception.
Remove wealth, embrace sincerity,
Humility and yielding follow reason—
Good and evil self-separate,
Thus nothing is concealed.

Remove strife yet uphold rectitude,
So that the people restrain themselves;
Unrestrain not where restraint is not due,
So that the people submit themselves.
Right the perverse, correct the chaotic,
Transform licentiousness, rectify customs—
None call it blessing,
Yet the world thrives in wildness,
All things find their natural place.
Not that there is no unrestraint—
Promote the upright, exalt the just,
Expose errors, highlight crimes,
Diminish the perverse, curb the crooked,
Reveal people’s faults—
The world is thoroughly rectified,
Yet action brings no sound.
Follow reason to mediate disputes,
Align with the Dao to suit the occasion—
Though just, there is no excess,
Though not unrestrained, it is not so.

Remove vanity yet uphold brightness,
So that the people act appropriately;
Dazzle not where dazzling is not due,
So that the people are naturally enlightened.
None call it illumination, none call it obscurity,
The world is vast and harmonious,
All things flourish and grow—
Virtue compares with Heaven,
Transformation aligns with the Dao.
Not that there is no dazzling—
Virtue shines universally,
Illuminates all things,
Yet its transformation is formless.

The Dao is its own brightness,
Permeating all without measure—
Each thing finds its own place,
No one knows its name.
Above and below mirror each other,
Inner and outer correspond,
Entry and exit leave no trace,
Movement and stillness know no bounds—
Like shadow to form, echo to sound.

Thus, the Way to govern a state,
The foundation of nurturing the people,
Is rooted in frugality.
No method surpasses frugality in governing people and harmonizing with Heaven.
Frugality means moderation and restraint.

Therefore, the enlightened kings and sage rulers
Diminish their outward displays,
Lower their official palaces,
Abandon the five flavors,
Extinguish music and color,
Use wisdom to dwell in simplicity,
Speak with clarity yet hold silence.
Establish a form without ostentation,
Set a pattern without imitation—
Fearful that others know them,
They conceal themselves in the unfathomable.

Thus, before they act, the world responds;
Before they command, the people gather;
Before they wage war, victory is assured;
Before they attack, the world submits.
Hence, they do not labor yet the people prosper,
They do not divide yet their duties are fulfilled,
They do not punish yet all fear them,
They do not scheme yet they receive Heaven’s blessings—
Disaster and chaos do not arise,
All auspicious signs converge,
Without action yet nothing fails to succeed,
Without strife yet nothing fails to conquer.
This is called "accumulating virtue"—
Thus, nothing fails to conquer.

All things return to their mysterious unity,
The world is in perfect accord—
Floating and sinking, ebbing and flowing,
Align with the Dao’s natural course.
Like end and beginning,
Like chaos and order,
Like emptiness and fullness,
Like absence and presence,
Like sparseness and density,
Like slowness and speed—
No form, no shadow,
No root, no trace—
Vague and indistinct,
Dark and silent,
Mysterious and boundless,
Like the vastness of Heaven and Earth,
Beyond measure or limit.

No one knows its limits.
Self-cultivation leaves abundance,
Thus one can establish a state;
Governing people and ordering things,
One’s descendants will never perish.
This is the way to establish a state.

Why so?

With its frugality thus established,
The Dao of sound is neither given nor bestowed—
Sparing and subtle, its virtue refined,
Full yet appearing as if nonexistent.
When sincerity flows through its intent,
Then endurance becomes its nature.

Form small, spirit vast—
A thousandfold its might,
One bearing ten thousand—
Thus it moves with effortless grace.

One principle governs all things,
In harmony with Heaven’s Dao.
Roots deep, foundations firm,
Dwelling with the divine—
The True Person embodies it,
The Sage preserves it.

This is the "mother of states,"
Deep-rooted, enduring, long-lived, and ever-visionary.

**On Governing Great States**

To govern a great state is to speak of its ruler—
Like poaching a small fish, gentle and unhurried.

With Dao as the cauldron, the world simmers beneath,
True authority reigns above—
Its spirits neither frighten nor harm.

What is not its spirit does not frighten,
Its spirit, when present, aids nature’s flow.
What is not its spirit does not harm life,
Its spirit, when balanced, nurtures all things pure.

Two forces unharming, Dao preserved,
Virtue returns—
A thousandfold the people’s blessing.

**Illustrating the Principle:**
When the sun declines, shadows rise;
Dryness peaks, winds stir;
Valleys tremble, seas surge high—
High and low stand in contrast,
Differing by hundreds of fathoms—
Because of their vast form.

Cliffs a thousand *ren* high,
Precipitous a hundred *zhang* deep—
Beasts ascend, yet crumble to ruin,
While gnats and ants glide unscathed,
And rhinos, elephants, tigers, and leopards—
Because of their weight—
Perish in the fall.

Gales howl, roofs lift, trees snap,
Rocks fly, iron scatters,
Mountains crumble—
Yet human blood flows undisturbed—
Because of their sudden might.

A breeze through cracks and holes
Stirs not a hair—
Yet when it enters the body,
It breeds a hundred ailments, bringing death—
Because of its subtlety.

Great states are like the ocean, like rhinos—
Yet their virtue is like the wind through cracks,
Like the breeze through holes.

Thus their blessings cannot be recklessly bestowed,
Their gains cannot be violently seized,
Their goodness cannot be grandly displayed,
Their evils cannot be recklessly abandoned.

To recklessly bestow is to recklessly lose,
To violently seize is to violently collapse,
To grandly display is to grandly depart,
To recklessly abandon is to recklessly invite.

To hold high office, wielding the world’s levers,
Power and authority already vast—
To agitate further would multiply losses.
Thus, governing a great state is like poaching a small fish.

Issuing decrees like the wind through cracks,
Still fearing overreach—
A thread’s tension, a hair’s breadth.

How much more so when indulging desires,
Lightly ruling the seas,
Acting with grand schemes,
Exhausting the people—
Then it is like the tiger’s torn flesh,
The wind’s shattered roofs—
Is it not fitting?

How may this be made clear?

Zhuangzi said:
To eat when starving yet gluttonously,
To drink when thirsty yet excessively,
To plunge into water when scorched,
To rush into fire when freezing—
Though the suffering ends,
The body must die.

A chest’s obstruction cannot be drilled,
A throat’s ailment cannot be scraped,
A gnat’s sting cannot be shot,
A louse’s bite cannot be hacked—
Why?
To remove small woes
Is to invite greater ruin.

The wise sovereign and sagely ruler govern a great state
Like handling the finest threads,
Like guiding a tiny stream,
Like discerning the autumn hair,
Like hearing nothing yet all is heard—
As if present yet absent,
As if true yet false,
As if acting yet resting,
In the realm where action is both action and non-action,
In the wild where transformation is in both having and not having—
Where blessings are subtle and benefits scarce,
Where words are few and prohibitions rare,
Where movement occurs in the formless,
And achievements flow throughout the lands.

He who grasps the essentials,
Moves little yet gains much.
He who loses the opportunity,
Acts much yet gains little.
Thus, the subtle opportunity
Exceeds the expectations of ten thousand men—
As if in both having and not having,
It cannot be shown to others.

Why is this so?
Because he takes **Dao/Way** as father,
And **virtue/power** as mother,
Divine wisdom as teacher,
And **Great Harmony (太和)** as friend,
Clarity and stillness as constant,
Simplicity and ease as master,
Heaven and Earth as law,
And the interplay of **yin** and **yang** as model—
The sun and moon as ritual,
All things as exemplars,
Responding to circumstances as fundamental principle,
And sincerity as the foremost virtue.

Distinguishing roles and duties,
Guiding with subtle yet profound silence,
Drawing forth the threads of governance,
Lifting the great essentials while seeking them within himself—
Thus, the people are like embryos,
The ruler is like an infant,
Cunning and deceit have no cause to arise,
And cleverness finds no opportunity to emerge.
All things are equal and balanced,
None overflowing, none deficient,
In perfect accord and compliance,
All things flourish abundantly,
Spirits and humans unite,
Together thriving in harmony,
Acting naturally without constraint,
Each fulfilling its inherent potential.

Silent as if without a ruler,
Secure as if without spirits—
All things grow to completion,
The people live to their natural span,
Reaching the end of their days,
None perish prematurely.

This is called **Dao/Way** nurturing the world,
Its spirits not acting with malevolence.
The ruler, if not **virtue/power** is lacking,
The spirits, if not divine, are not malevolent.
The ruler is not lacking in **virtue/power**,
Yet he universally applies benevolence,
His **virtue/power** permeates all directions,
And he does not favor or pity selectively.

The spirits are not malevolent,
Yet they float in vague uncertainty,
They ride upon the slightest changes,
They traverse all lands,
Conforming to time’s transformations,
Their divine essence encompassing all things,
Yet they do not harm humanity.

It is not that their divine essence does not harm,
But when the sage rules above,
He aligns with Heaven,
Humans and spirits harmonize,
Great transformation flows naturally,
Cunning does not arise,
Strange things do not emerge,
None are full, none are empty—
The world murmurs in accord,
All things equal and balanced,
Neither raising high nor digging deep,
Not assaulting metals and stones,
Not blocking rivers and springs,
People do not migrate far,
Food is not scarce—
All may be enjoyed,
None can be shaped or forced,
Grasses and trees yellow and then fall,
Humans transform fully and then end.
Thus, the sage does not harm.

Therefore, what Heaven nurtures,
What Earth contains,
What **Great One (太一)** governs,
What **Heavenly Unity (天一)** leads—
The four seasons converge,
The five phases align,
Joy and sorrow share the same threshold,
Fortune and misfortune share the same gate.
Thus, what brings peace also brings peril,
And what brings peril also brings peace;
What preserves life also brings death,
And what brings death also preserves life.
He who knows peace yet forgets peril is secure,
He who knows security yet forgets peril is in danger.
How may this be made clear?

The tiger and leopard, with their majestic forms and broad adornments,
Firm claws and teeth, resplendent hides and abundant fur,
Distinct markings bright and clear—
Thus they seize all beasts yet are mastered by humankind.

The fragrant and splendid grasses, with their radiant hues and sweet scents,
Thus delight the multitude yet harm their own roots.

The sovereign of a great realm, with vast lands and teeming people,
High status and favored form, towering might and illustrious name—
Thus they provoke neighboring states yet endanger their own rule.

When the **Dao/Way** is upheld, they are steadfast as a flat stone,
Secure as the great mountain.

When the **Dao/Way** is lost, they are perilous as a pile of eggs,
Light as a feather.

Both weak, they suffer first;
Both chaotic, they perish first.
Thus, great realms are the steps to tyranny
And the stage to ruin.

Therefore, the sovereign of a great realm
Stands alone with none to rival,
Mountains encircle their borders, three sides blocked by defenses,
Rivers unite their flow, all things beneath them bow—
The hub of the feudal lords.

A storehouse of fertile lands,
The corpse of the strong and mighty,
The master of power and influence,
Bound by unmeasured steadfastness,
Choked by narrow and constrained paths.

Abundant and rich, vast and easy,
Spanning thousands of miles,
Treasure and marvels without end,
Few taxes or burdens upon the people,
Herds and flocks roam freely,
Boats and carriages numberless,
Arms and provisions piled high,
The people dwell in ease and joy,
Travelers pause and stay—
Men like grass and trees,
Cattle filling the hills and fields,
Hunting and tilling, their gains tenfold.

Thus, all under Heaven desire to submit,
And ministers and generals strive to attach—
With chariots and cavalry charging boldly,
A million armored men,
Defending easy terrain, holding strong passes,
Favored by Heaven’s order, Earth’s support—
They suspend life, dictate death,
Assist them and they gain strength,
Betray them and they lose their ancestral halls.
Thus, the feudal lords desire their alliance,
And all under Heaven fears their might.

So-called great realms,
Are the currents of all under Heaven,
The meeting of all under Heaven’s exchanges.

When the **Dao/Way** is extended, they can unite and encompass,
When virtue and favor are exalted, they can issue commands,
When they are struck, they can exalt benevolence,
When they govern, they can clarify righteousness,
When they unite, they can expand their lands,
When they take, they can grow their wealth—
Thus the feudal lords delight in them,
And ministers and generals profit from them.

Therefore, from ancient times to today,
Great realms—like the female—
Conquer with stillness the male,
Unchanged for ten thousand ages,
Unaltered for a hundred thousand years.

Why is this so?
They receive the full with emptiness,
They respond to the present with the void,
They do not seek to be great,
But strive to be small,
They do not seek to be high,
But always remain low.

The female guards with yielding softness,
The male seeks with forceful vigor—
Thus the female ever conquers the male with stillness.

Excessive fullness brings regret,
Hence great realms should act as the lowly.

Thus, the enlightened kings and sage rulers in great realms
Extend the **Dao/Way** yet do not claim possession,
Act humbly yet do not seek subservience—
Their lands enfold the realms of feudal lords,
Yet none dare oppose them;
Their virtue encompasses the strength of feudal lords,
Yet none dare resist them;
They bow in submission to align with others’ will,
Their loyalty, integrity, and sincerity lead their officers—
They divide lands east and west to attract the worthy and brilliant,
They diligently till and weave to amass wealth and resources,
They form shifting alliances to guard against unforeseen threats.

They open granaries and distribute wealth,
Nourish the aged and feed the orphaned,
Relieve the poor and aid the destitute,
Honor recluses in their caves.

They receive yet do not take,
They grant yet do not withhold—
Softness, simplicity, and ease,
Taking no action while in position.

Though feudal lords may be greedy and vile,
Resentful and haughty, relying on strength,
And though they dislike compliance and plot rebellion,
They are still subdued by the **Dao/Way**’s might and virtue’s weight,
By yielding stillness and humility—
Then they mend their ways, correct their errors,
Cede lands and offer treasures,
Submit their allegiance, even risk their lives,
And beg to be made vassals, border guards of their realm.

So-called great realms acting humbly toward small realms,
Are those who take small realms.

When they occupy small and weak realms,
They follow the **Dao/Way** in action,
Govern with moderation and care,
Wealth in boats and carriages,
Strength in arms and provisions,
Loyalty, sincerity, and honesty—
They value simplicity and honor tillage,
Tilling and weaving are their duties,
They do not tax the people,
Superior and inferior in harmony,
Affection like father and son,
The ruler as the heart within the body,
The people as its limbs—
Their realm unified in peace,
They can share life and death,
Superior and inferior in accord,
They can join with neighboring states in mutual trust.

Though the sovereigns of great realms
Bear the weight of many strong powers,
Hold sway over influence and authority,
Left with virtue and right with benevolence,
Their hearts like hungry tigers,
Their wrath like surging springs—
They do not delight in giving,
But always wish to devour others.

Yet if they gain the will of Heaven,
The favor of the people,
The trust of ministers and generals,
The aid of neighboring states,
And raise the unmeasured might of their enemies,
If they display their unfathomable power,
If they humble their bodies and exhaust their sincerity,
If they act with clear and tranquil purpose—
Then their spirits are moved, their minds swayed,
Their wrath shifts, their calamities depart,
And they become my strange allies.

Small realms acting humbly toward great realms,
Are those who take great realms.

Those who take great realms,
Are those who seize what others depend upon.

The superior who takes from others,
Their lands vast, their influence abundant,
Their virtue broad and their power heavy—
This is what others seek.

Great realms, acting without force,
Can secure this advantage.

But they must always unite with the lowly,
And thus gain what others possess.

The inferior who takes from others,
Their lands narrow, their people few,
Their power light and their virtue scarce—
This is what others easily seize.

Small realms, being light,
Are often taken by others.
Forced to submit,
They must not be greedy.

Thus, without battle they destroy another’s city,
Without assault they surrender another’s stronghold—
Their lands expand, their names grow eminent,
Their ancestral halls stand in glory,
Their deeds and virtues flow without end—
This is what great realms aspire to.

Great realms, if they but guard their yielding nature,
Can naturally hope for such benefits.

In alliance with great realms,
In close ties and bonds of kinship—
When disasters strike, great realms share their concern,
When neighboring states are in peril, great realms offer aid,
They bend beneath one man yet raise ten thousand above,
Their altars honored, their ancestral halls illustrious—
Their realm rich, their armies strong,
Their people and resources complete—
Their prosperity extends without end,
This is what small realms wish for.

Small realms serve the great with humility,
And thus the great themselves bear their concern—
This is how they secure their survival.

Hence, they border neighboring lands with measured restraint,
Hold the scales of power without swaying,
Act first to gain first advantage,
The humble govern the proud,
The still overcome the restless,
They occupy the high ground while yielding to the great—
Small yields to great, small gains from great.

Why is this so?
The Way of Nature cannot be forced.
Water flows downward when moved,
Humans act when drawn by gain.
If the great release their dominance and entrust matters,
The many weak unite as one,
Emerging from the unexpected—
This is how the strong perish.

Thus, the great should yield.
When the great oppress the small, calamity follows.
When the small retreat in humility, aid comes from the many—
Therefore, the great should embrace yielding.

**Chapter on the Essence of All Things**

The Dao/Way is the essence of all things, opening and guiding them.
It is the treasure of the virtuous, who embody **weakness** (*yì* 翕),
While the unvirtuous cannot preserve it—
They are bound by **rigid constraints** (*qūyuē* 拘约).

**Fine words** (*měiyán* 美言) can secure what one desires,
**Noble conduct** (*zūnxíng* 尊行) can elevate one to high rank.
Yet humans, when unvirtuous, love to act contrary—
Why should they abandon **favor** (*chǒng* 宠) and endure **deprivation** (*xiāo* 削)?

Thus, the **Sage-King** (*Shàngzì* 上子) establishes the **Son of Heaven** (*Tiānzǐ* 天子),
And sets the **Three Exalted Ministers** (*Sāngōng* 三公)—
All are **virtuous and sage** (*xiánshèng* 贤圣).
Even if one offers **a jade tablet** (*gǒngbì* 拱璧) as a light burden,
Or **four steeds** (*xiāndàmǎ* 先驷马) for secure dwelling,
It is not as precious as **this Dao**—
**Words and deeds** (*yánxíng* 言行) refined and cultivated.

The ancients valued this Dao because it harmonizes the human heart—
Why not say: *"Seek and gain"* (*qiúyǐdé* 求以得) is but **power and force** (*shìzé* 势则),
And *"Crime forgiven, none to blame"* (*yǒuzuìyǐmiǎn* 有罪以免) is mere **self-indulgence** (*wéiwéiyǐwéi* 无以为)?

Thus, this Dao is **held in highest esteem** (*guì* 贵) throughout the world.

**On Calamities** (*Zhǐguī* 指归):
Wood grows from its **root** (*běn* 本) to its **tip** (*mò* 末).
The tip depends on the **branches** (*tiáo* 条),
The branches on the **limbs** (*zhī* 枝),
The limbs on the **trunk** (*jìng* 茎),
The trunk on the **root** (*běn* 本),
The root on **Heaven and Earth** (*Tiāndì* 天地),
And Heaven and Earth receive it from the **formless** (*wúxíng* 无形).

**Flower and fruit** (*huāshí* 华实) arise from **vital qi** (*yǒuqì* 有气),
Vital qi from the **four seasons** (*sìshí* 四时),
The four seasons from **yin-yang** (*yīnyáng* 阴阳),
Yin-yang from Heaven and Earth,
And Heaven and Earth receive it from the **formless**.

Thus, I know the Dao/Way—
From the **formless shape** (*wúxíng* 无形) and **featureless aspect** (*wúzhuàng* 无状),
Opening **emptiness** (*xū* 虚),
Guiding **spiritual penetration** (*shéntōng* 神通),
Harmonizing Heaven and Earth,
Calming yin-yang,
Regulating the four seasons,
Resolving the myriad regions,
Diverse forms and kinds all flourish and complete.
**Transformation and change** (*biànhuà* 变化) know no end—
The **constant** (*cháng* 常) is **non-action** (*wúwéi* 无为).
No love nor hatred, it aligns with all things—
All classes respond, each attaining its proper course.

This is the Dao/Way, the essence of all things.
The virtuous who attain it **expand and contract** (*yìzhāng* 以翕以张),
Pure and serene, soft and weak,
Silent and indistinct—
**Ren** (*rén* 仁) is gentle and harmonious,
Nourishing and tranquil, **virtue** (*dé* 德) is **power** (*shì* 势) yet **subtle** (*wúxíng* 无形).
**Great and small** (*dàxiǎo* 大小) are **comprehensive** (*zhōumì* 周密),
Fine and minute are **invisible** (*wúxíng* 无形),
**Mysterious penetration** (*Xuándá* 玄达) reaches all affairs,
And returns to the **Nameless** (*wúmíng* 无名).

**Change and return** (*zhōngshǐ* 终始) are **reversed** (*fǎnfù* 反覆),
All blessings arise naturally—
Acting, one secures what is desired,
Stillness, one avoids what is harmful.
Above all others, its **virtue** (*wéi* 威) and **power** (*dé* 德) are **self-evident** (*zìmíng* 自明).
It **overcomes the firm** (*jīan* 坚) and **conquers the great** (*dà* 大),
None can rival it in **duality** (*shuāng* 双).
Thus, it is the treasure of the virtuous.

The **wicked** (*xiōng* 凶) who attain it **emit and expand** (*fāzhāng* 以发以张),
Firm and rigid, yet **coarse and scattered** (*yǐcū* 以疏),
**Substance and action** (*shí* 实) come **first** (*xiān* 先),
**Arrogance** (*jiāo* 骄) overflows, **swelling** (*yì* 溢) in **grandeur** (*zhuàngdà* 壮大),
**Fullness** (*shèng* 盛) and **excess** (*mǎn* 满) **strengthen to extremity** (*yǐqiángjí* 以强极),
**Ambitious cultivation** (*guāngxiū* 广修) is **boundless** (*wújiāng* 无疆),
**Bright scrutiny** (*zhāochá* 照察) is **dazzling** (*yǐngyǐng* 以荧荧),
**Clear display** (*xiǎndé* 显的) is **radiant** (*yǐzhāngzhāng* 以彰彰).

The **strong grow small** (*qiángdàzhōngxiǎo* 强大终小),
**Calamity does not come** (*bùhuòzìshēng* 不祸自生)—
Acting, one loses what is desired,
Stillness, one suffers harm.
**Heart troubled** (*xīn yōu* 忧), **resolve diminished** (*zhì xiāo* 志削),
Then one **returns to the norm** (*fǎnzhèngcháng* 反正常).

**Spiritual qi** (*shénqì* 神气) is **agitated** (*fáncù* 烦促),
**Contracting** (*qū* 趋) while **expanding** (*zhāng* 张) is abandoned,
**Oppressed and confined** (*yùyuē* 郁约), yet **words are humble** (*cí bēi* 辞卑),
**Bound and restrained** (*jūzhì* 拘制), yet **body is lowered** (*tǐ jiàng* 体降),
**Driven to peril** (*pòxiǎn* 迫险), yet **guests are subservient** (*bīn fú* 宾伏),
**Anxious and fearful** (*wěidá* 悿怛), yet **loyal and trustworthy** (*zhōngxìn* 忠信),
**Altering appearance** (*gǎiyǒng* 改容) while **easing restraints** (*yìjié* 易节),
**Aligning with the virtuous** (*yǔjūnzǐ* 与君子同).

**Crime is fixed** (*zuìdìng* 罪定) yet **words are good** (*yánshàn* 而言善),
**At death’s door** (*línsǐ* 临死) yet **love for life** (*ài shēn* 爱身),
**Obedient to Heaven’s decree** (*yīfèng Tiānshù* 一奉天数),
**Changing nature** (*biànxìng* 变性) and **easing emotions** (*yìqíng* 易情),
**Finding joy in poverty** (*ān pín* 安贫) and **delighting in hardship** (*lè kùn* 乐困),
**Lowliness and humiliation** (*bēijiàn* 卑贱) as **constant** (*cháng* 常),
**Honoring Heaven** (*zūn Tiān* 尊天) and **respecting spirits** (*jìng guǐ* 敬鬼),
**Viewing others as kings** (*shì rén rú wáng* 视人如王),
**Above like cattle and horses** (*shàng bǐ niúmǎ* 上比牛马),
**Below like dogs and sheep** (*xià liè quǎnyáng* 下列犬羊),
**Heaven’s net is drawn** (*Tiānwǎng yǐfā* 天网以发),
**Yet nature does not hear** (*zìrán bùtīng* 自然不听).

Ah, how painful it is!
This warning is **most clear** (*shènmíng* 甚明).
The unvirtuous do not preserve themselves—
They **burden** (*lěi* 累) the **True** (*Zhēn* 真).
When the burden is complete,
They **regret too late** (*fānghuǐ bùjí* 方悔不及).

This is like **digging a well when thirsty** (*línkě juéjǐng* 临渴掘井),
Not as wise as **ordering affairs before chaos arises** (*lǐ yú wèiluàn* 理於未乱).
These two paths diverge—
Both stem from **Daoic practice** (*dàoxíng* 道行),
**One precedes, one follows** (*zàiqián zàihòu* 在前在后),
**One thrives, one perishes** (*huòcún huòwáng* 或存或亡).
The virtuous **practice the Dao first** (*xiāndào* 先道) and **thrive**,
The wicked **practice the Dao late** (*hòudào* 后道) and **perish**.

Thus, **words and deeds** are the **litigation of the self** (*zhìshēn zhī yù* 治身之狱).
**Timely harmony** (*shíhé* 时和) and **order of precedence** (*xiānhòu* 先后)
Belong to the **Great Destiny** (*dàmìng* 大命).

Therefore, the **virtuous person** (*jūnzǐ* 君子) in **self-cultivation** (*lìshēn* 立身):
**Like the deaf** (*rú hā* 如哈) and **like the mute** (*rú lóng* 如聋),
**Like the uncarved block** (*ruò pǔ* 若朴) or **plain wood** (*ruò zhì* 若质),
**Hiding words in the heart** (*cángyán yúxīn* 藏言於心),
**Ever dwelling in silent mystery** (*chángchǔ xuánmò* 常处玄默),
When speaking, **deep reflection** (*shēn sī* 深思),
**Voice rises like weeping** (*fāshēng ruòkū* 发声若哭),
**Harmonious and yielding** (*héshùn shíshì* 和顺时适),
**Completing others’ blessings** (*chéng rén zhī fú* 成人之福),
**Responding with modest refusal** (*yìngduì cí ràng* 应对辞让),
**Straight yet undecorated** (*zhí ér bùshì* 直而不饰).

Thus, **speech fills the world** (*yán mǎn tiānxìa* 言满天下) yet **is not excessive** (*bù duō* 不多),
**Vibrations reach the four seas** (*zhèndòng sìhǎi* 振动四海) yet **are not hasty** (*bù sù* 不速),
**Connecting all things** (*liánjiē wànwù* 连接万物) yet **not possessing** (*bù yǒu* 不有),
**Words move the world** (*cí dòng tiānxià* 辞动天下),
Each attaining what they desire.

**Fine words** can be **traded** (*shì* 市).
In **governing the world** (*jīngshì* 经世),
Their **qi and resolve** (*qìzhì* 气志) are **obscured** (*yǎomíng* 窅冥),
Their **form and bearing** (*xíngróng* 形容) are **hidden** (*yǐn* 隐),
**Dwelling as if in fear** (*jū rú jīngkǒng* 居如惊恐),
**Appearance seems insufficient** (*mào sì bùzú* 貌似不足),
**Diminished and faint** (*pí pí chǎ chǎ* 偆偆漻漻),
**Dissolving like ice melting** (*xiāo rú bīngjiě* 消如冰释),
**Extending with the times** (*yù shí ér shēn* 遇时而伸),
**Hiding when the world is unready** (*zāo shì ér fú* 遭世而伏),
**Sharing Heaven’s sorrow** (*yǔ Tiān tóng yōu* 与天同忧),
**Heart deeply moved** (*zhōngxīn rě* 中心恻恻),
**Plans fail to execute** (*jìhuà bùxíng* 计画不行),
**Adapting to the times** (*suí shí fǎncè* 随时反侧),
**Humility and modesty** (*qiánxū zhǐzú* 谦虚止足),
**Self-abasing** (*bēisǔn zìmù* 卑损自牧).

**Joy in lowliness** (*lè xià* 乐下) like water,
Enduring yet **never rigid** (*jiǔ ér bùshì* 久而不式),
**Lowering ever further** (*xià zhī yòu xià zhī* 下之又下之),
To the **ultimate extreme** (*yuánjí* 元极),
The world responds to them—
Thus, they can **have a realm** (*yǒu guó* 有国).

**Noble conduct** can **elevate others** (*jiā rén* 加人).
Why is this so?

「Human nature and disposition are such that they delight in honor and favor, abhor lowliness and shame, resent when diminished, rejoice when enriched, take pleasure in being lowered, and scorn being restrained. This is the universal Dao of past and present, and the natural logic of human hearts.

The worthy practice this even more so; the petty even more so. Therefore, when one cultivates noble speech and conduct, there will be no misfortune in one’s undertakings.

In ancient times, those who led the people—how could they be abandoned? The officials of Jie and Zhou could be made to follow virtue. The soldiers of Qin and Chu could be made to follow virtue.

What is called "what people do not approve of"—how could it be abandoned?

Thus, if one can win their hearts, the realm may be obtained; if one cannot grasp their intentions, even one’s wives and concubines will not obey.

How can this be demonstrated?

The rank of nobility commands the realm,
Wealth possesses the four seas,
Might and influence are boundless,
Absolute power and authority are held—
these are what people fear.

To establish the Son of Heaven.

To depart from the ranks of foot soldiers,
To leave the common troops,
To rise with grand purpose like a dragon,
To assist the Son of Heaven,
To spread the Way and display virtue,
To enact all good governance,
To let benevolence flow to all households,
To honor and illuminate one’s ancestors—
these are what people benefit from.

To appoint the Three Exalted Ministers.

Using what people fear to seek what they benefit from,
With speech that is not beautiful and conduct that is not respectful,
Even if one presents the great jade tablet or holds precious treasures to offer,
Even if one rides in a fine carriage with four horses,
The worthy’s heart will remain doubtful and hesitant,
The Mysterious Sage will remain deeply hidden,
And the gentleman will not come.

Because the Son of Heaven possesses an awe-inspiring might,
And the Three Exalted Ministers bestow abundant blessings upon the people,
Yet relying solely on oneself to lord over others,
Offering the jade and silk of favors,
People will not submit to it.

Thus, it is said: *It is better to sit and advance this Dao than to labor with carriages and treasures.*

When speech and conduct are refined within,
Then the spirit and qi overflow outward.
Without the toil of four horses or the expense of precious jades,
The scholars of the land will respond in harmony like the wind,
And the virtuous, heroic, and talented will gather from all directions,
Their radiance reaching its peak.
The Sage will descend, and the court will abound with gentlemen.

This is because of *sitting and advancing this Dao*.

Why did the ancients value this Dao so highly?
Because speech aligns with Heaven and Earth yet does not boast,
Conduct harmonizes with human hearts yet does not rely on force,
Reputation is achieved without display,
Accomplishment is realized without possession.

Emotion and disposition flow naturally,
Not seized for personal gain,
But to follow the Way,
Not for oneself,
All things return to it,
And it governs the realm.

This is called *obtaining without seeking, having virtue without claiming*—
Thus, it is valued by all under Heaven.

**On the Chapter of Non-Action (Wuwei)**

Non-action is formless,
Non-doing is silent,
Tastelessness is nameless.

Great or small, much or little—virtue and power are manifest,
Yet repaying grudges with virtue is done before they arise.
Planning for difficulties in ease,
Considering what is not yet formed,
Acting for the great in the small,
Making the subtle profound—
This is how the Sage says that even the brightest ruler
Never undertakes great matters in their slightest form,
Thus achieving their grandest purpose and aligning with humanity.

Those who make light of promises must be few in trust—*this cannot be done*.
Those who act on many trifles must face many calamities—*this cannot be relied upon*.

Even the Sage finds difficulty in constant scheming,
Thus ultimately avoiding calamity and achieving completeness.

**On the Principle of Return (Zhigui):**

The numbers of the Divine Mind,
The Dao of Nature—
What is not born does not perish,
What is born does not persist,
What neither perishes nor persists
Is the birth of what neither perishes nor persists.

From this perspective,
Sorrow does not generate sorrow,
Joy does not generate joy,
Neither sorrow nor joy
Is the birth of sorrow and joy.

Thus, those dwelling in misfortune gain blessings,
Those dwelling in blessings suffer misfortune.
The master of blessings and misfortune lies with the ruler.

To act without form,
To listen without sound,
Without form or sound, it becomes profound and far-reaching—
Thus, *non-action’s function is great*, while *action’s function is small*,
*Virtue’s power is thin*, while *non-virtue’s power is thick*.

One who embodies *neither non-being nor being* yet generates *non-being and being*
Can transform misfortune and blessings,
Neither misfortune nor blessing,
Yet can resolve both.

Like a mirror before one’s face,
Acting before what has not yet arisen—
Thus, it becomes profound and far-reaching, great and thick.

Hence, the Sage does not act for being,
Does not act for non-being,
Does not act for death,
Does not act for life,
But wanders in the realm of *non-being*,
Dwells in the space between death and life,
Adapting and responding naturally,
Thus maintaining the constant.

Therefore, *without looking, they see*,
*Without listening, they hear*,
Supporting and stabilizing Heaven and Earth,
Embellishing the Way and nourishing the spirit,
Lifting and guiding all things,
Ruling the imperial realm and governing the people,
Freeing emotions and releasing intentions—
All return to their original truth.

This is called *Non-action as Non-action*—
Simply responding to the appropriate changes.

They have never truly known,
Thus they can do without limit.

Not creating life’s burdens,
Not stirring up affairs,
Not adding with kindness,
Not bestowing with benefit,
Teaching what cannot be taught,
Guiding what lacks awareness,
Cutting off what the people delight in,
To follow their true emotions,
Permitting what the people abhor,
To grasp their true intentions.

Exiting the door of untimely death,
Entering the path of eternal life,
Soaring in the Mysterious Depths,
Rejoicing in the Great Primordial,
Dim and vast, beyond knowing,
Thick and murky, as if in darkness—
The world knows no troubles.

This is called *Non-doing as doing*—
Simply altering what has already become.

They have never truly thought,
Thus they reach *Non-doing*.

Tasting what is tasteless,
Observing what is formless—
Thus they can distinguish the categories of similarity and difference,
And clarify the nature of right and wrong.

Acting before what has not yet arisen,
Fixing before it has tilted—
Brave deeds are unseen,
Wise names are unclaimed,
Blessings do not arise,
Misfortunes do not take root—
*Blessings without blessings*
Rest in the silent,
*Misfortunes without misfortunes*
Cease in the nameless,
Ensuring the people’s peace and joy,
And the realm’s great harmony.

This is called *Tastelessness as taste*—
Simply discerning what has not yet sprouted.

They have never truly intended,
Thus they achieve without limit.

Therefore, the ruler worries and alleviates calamity,
Extends and secures blessings,
Kills traitors who dishonor the lord,
Avenges those who insult the father,
Overcomes those who create difficulties,
Destroys those who stir up chaos,
Repels bandits who invite disaster,
Punishes rebels who defy order.

When brave deeds are seen, they conflict with Heaven,
When wise names arise, they oppose the Way.」

「When actions stir the people’s delight,
Yet labor yields little virtue—
When deeds are done and the people rejoice,
Yet the giver’s kindness is slight.

If one cannot practice *wuwei* (無為) as *wuwei*,
And treat affairs as nonexistent,
Then the vast benefits of earlier efforts
Are outweighed by the petty gains of later kindness—
Great and small differ in measure,
And blame for calamity is unavoidable.
Thus it is said: *"Great and small, much and little."*

Therefore, loyalty and trust are undermined,
Righteous undertakings perish,
And those who oppose naturally submit,
While the clever fly high.

Those who usurp merit are exposed,
Those who steal authority are revealed,
The violent prosper in chaos,
The deceitful thrive in corruption.

Right and wrong are inverted,
The realm teeters toward collapse,
Things lose their natural order,
And states perish in ruin.

Thus, it is better to prevent calamity
Than to remedy it after it has grown great;
To act before disorder arises
Is nobler than to speak after it has begun.

This is the benefit of *unspeaking*,
The nobility of *wuwei*.

Hence, the virtuous one
Acts before the first stirrings,
Stays still in the absence of absence,
Spreads the Dao and bestows virtue,
Transforms and harmonizes in the mysterious,
Angers without showing anger,
Speaks without uttering words,
Strikes without daring to attack,
Defends without a fixed end,
Commands without force,
And avenges grudges before they sprout.

*Virtue* is the root of order,
*Grudges* are the end of affairs.
To extinguish the end and return to the root,
One must cultivate virtue and revert to the true—
Then affairs and things dissolve unseen before they manifest.

Thus it is said:
To act before the first stirrings,
To speak before speaking—
Is to avenge grudges with virtue.

Plotting against difficulties while they are easy,
Treating their fundamental causes,
Eradicating them before signs appear,
So they cannot take form—
Then deeds are as fine as autumn hair,
And achievements as vast as Tai Mountain.

Greatness over smallness,
Tending to things thread by thread,
Respectful and cautious,
As if beginning anew each time,
Not yielding to desires,
Not seeking personal advantage,
Always opposing what is done,
Alone preserving the origin—
With time, all benefits accumulate,
Daily progress knows no bounds.
Though one does not strive for greatness,
Affairs unfold naturally.

This is plotting against difficulties while they are easy,
Yet greatness arises from smallness.

Therefore, when great calamities are about to emerge,
They are like evil winds invading a person.
Before they manifest,
Guard against them so they do not come.
When they lodge in the skin and hair,
Use warm compresses to dispel them.
When they reach the joints and tendons,
Apply gentle admonitions to remove them.
When they affect the internal organs,
A hundred medicines can cure them.
When they penetrate to the marrow,
Even Heaven and Earth cannot alleviate them,
And *zaohua* (造化) cannot treat them.

This is what is meant by *"difficult matters arise from the easy."*

When great undertakings are about to begin,
They are like water flowing from mountains.
At first, it dampens and moistens,
Then ripples appear,
Steadily trickling and gathering,
It becomes rivers and valleys,
Swelling and surging,
Capable of carrying ships and floating stones,
And finally forming vast seas,
Deep and immeasurable.

This is how great undertakings arise from small beginnings.

Thus, when the sage establishes merit and renown,
Even minute beginnings can become manifest,
Even hidden origins can become clear,
Small beginnings can grow vast,
And concealed truths can become evident—
Their ambition lies beneath the myriad people,
So they become rulers and kings.

Their authority shakes the world,
The Four Seas are all rectified,
Their commands are obeyed, their governance accepted,
None can stand against them—
Their virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth,
Their wisdom shines like the sun and moon.

The sage never seeks greatness,
And thus achieves it.

Therefore, those who speak much of gratitude
Will be burdened with many affairs and still lack trust—
Such behavior cannot be sustained.
Those whose hearts easily sway
Will accumulate difficulties and change—
Such behavior cannot be relied upon.
Light promises lead to few fulfillments.

Trust, when easily given, leads to many calamities—
This is the natural order.

Thus, the sage remains inwardly silent,
Unmoved in action, speechless in words,
Unseeing in gaze, unhearing in listening.
In motion, they are like Heaven and Earth,
In stillness, like spirits and gods—
They achieve without doing,
They inspire trust without speaking,
Advance with no rivals,
Retreat with no limits,
Their body knows no minor worries,
Their state no trivial calamities.

The sage embodies the Dao,
Does not engage in artificial deeds,
Aligns with the true and cultivates virtue,
And naturally faces no calamities—
Thus they never encounter difficulties.

Why is this so?
Peril lies in what seems not perilous,
Ruination lies in what seems not ruined—
It is clearly visible alone,
And operates through formlessness.

In times of no danger,
They always regard it as dangerous;
In times of no ruin,
They always regard it as ruinous—
With trembling vigilance,
They act before the first signs appear,
Thus avoiding peril and ruin.

Their ease in holding fast is like their ease in maintaining the state and self,
Their ease in plotting against calamities is like their ease in preventing disasters before they arise,
Their ease in breaking calamities is like their ease in dispersing them before they settle,
Their ease in treating calamities is like their ease in transforming their roots before they manifest.

Those who act invite defeat,
Those who grasp invite loss—
Thus the sage, with *wuwei*, faces no defeat,
Knowing it comes from itself;
With *wuwei* in grasping, faces no loss,
Knowing virtue comes from itself.

When the people engage in affairs,
They do so with purpose—
The sage always stops them
Before their undertakings are fully formed,
Thus avoiding defeat and blame.

Therefore, the sage says of enlightened rulers:
Desiring what they do not desire,
Thinking what they have not thought—
They do not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures,
Nor value jade and pearls.

Learning what they have not learned,
Doing what is empty—
They restore what others have already passed,
And do not cling to the fading.

They aid the natural unfolding of all things,
Assisting Heaven and Earth,
Yet do not dare to act artificially,
Nor to uphold false traditions.

*Pointing to the origin:*
Before illness takes hold in a person,
It is easy for a physician to act;
Before a state faces peril,
It is easy for counselors to devise strategies;
Before grudges sprout like teeth,
It is easy to address them;
Before minor calamities grow strong,
It is easy to relieve them.

How should this be applied?»

Zhuangzi said:
When a cart’s wheel is still intact,
A child can guide it along—
Yet when it begins to wobble,
Toppling into ravines and heights,
A thousand men cannot steady it.

Before an egg is cracked,
A single finger can brush it—
Yet once it becomes a soaring wild goose,
Flapping its wings through the clouds,
No snare or net can ensnare it.

When a calf is still nursing,
A single rope can restrain it—
Yet once it becomes a bull,
No net can contain it.

When a tiger seizes the herd,
Feeding on oxen and horses,
No sword or spear can resist it.

Thus, a single drop of water,
Over time, becomes a river and sea;
A small serpent, if not killed,
Transforms into a divine dragon.

Accumulated goodness leads to auspicious fortune,
Unchecked evil leads to ruin.

Therefore, when a successor-ruler governs,
With no grievances or malice,
Ministers and officials are harmonized,
The people submit in peace,
Neighboring states trade freely,
No slanderers or traitors exist,
The realm is tranquil and undisturbed,
Superior and inferior in accord.
At such times,
Rule requires no coercion,
Governance demands no force—
Non-action, non-interference,
And none can overcome it.
Its stability is effortless to maintain.

Yet when a state teeters toward peril,
The people face ruin,
Disasters loom though not yet manifest—
At this juncture,
Safety rests within oneself, not others.
Counsel need not come from sages,
Strength need not come from warriors—
Yet even on one’s deathbed,
Disaster may already be sealed.
Its onset is easy to avert.

When the ruler abandons the Dao,
Ministers harbor resentment,
Neighboring states cease trade,
Officials grow negligent,
Disasters take root—
Though still weak and fragile.
At this stage,
Wise men plot in secret,
Yet before action is taken, peril arises,
Before force is applied, ruin shatters.
Its fragility is easy to break.

When the ruler strays from rectitude,
Ministers err in counsel,
Neighboring states harbor grudges,
The people waver,
Disasters have already surfaced—
Roots and branches unmoored,
Ambition rises, yet lacks support,
Alliances form but do not bind.
At this point,
Honoring the worthy while suppressing the masses,
Severing loyalty and resolve,
Listening to whispers and probing faults,
Seeking blame within oneself—
Yet even then, advisors scatter before battle is joined.
Its subtlety is easy to disperse,
Though already far harder than when unmanifest.

Thus, fortune and calamity arise from the nameless,
Life and death emerge from the subtle.
These two forces intertwine,
Shifting like winds and waves,
Extending and contracting like tides—
Advancing and retreating in chaos.
To hear them is impossible,
To see them is invisible,
Cunning cannot act upon them,
Wisdom cannot discern them.
The mechanisms of life and death, fortune and ruin,
Are subtle, chaotic, and unseen.

Therefore, the sage transforms through the Dao,
Teaches through personal example,
Acts before things take form,
Govern before disorder arises—
Without intervention, things settle naturally,
Without nurturing, things preserve themselves.
Action aligns with fortune,
Stillness diverges from ruin,
Mysterious and obscure—
None perceive its origin.

Preventing chaos before it arises,
Rectifying before imbalance,
Cutting off deceit at its root,
Suppressing falsehood at its source,
Sealing the door to vice,
Blocking the path to wrongdoing—
Before sprouts take hold,
Before signs appear,
Before destruction is visible,
Before annihilation is complete—
Teach without teaching,
Guide without naming,
Know without knowing,
Shape without form—
Chaos cannot take root,
Disorder cannot emerge,
The world governs itself,
Life unfolds naturally.

This is to act before existence,
To govern before chaos.

As for the great tree of Tai Mountain,
Its roots rest in the shade,
Its branches reach the sun—
Branches sprawl, leaves spread,
Fruit lush and green,
Trunks wide enough to embrace,
Towers high beyond measure—
Yet it grows from nothingness,
Completes itself through non-action.

What is called an embrace-worthy tree
Arises from the tiniest sprout.
A nine-tiered tower,
Broad as hills, towering a hundred *ren* high,
Piercing the heavens—
Yet it begins with a single clod of earth,
Rises from the ground.

Thus, the great is not forced to be great,
The small is not forced to be small,
The high is not forced to ascend,
The low is not forced to descend.
Neither great nor small—
Then greatness and smallness emerge.
Neither high nor low—
Then height and depth manifest.

Therefore, the artificer
Does not leave traces of his craft,
The non-artificer
Provides the path for creation.
Not great, not small—
This is the path of non-action.
Not high, not low—
This is the path of non-artificer.
Yet greatness and smallness,
Highness and lowness—
These are the traces of action,
The marks of the artificer.

Thus, what is completed is ruined,
What is pursued becomes harm,
What is clung to leads to death,
What is fostered is abandoned.
Grasping what one desires,
One loses it.
Clinging to what one thinks,
One loses it.
Holding onto oneself,
One loses oneself.
Fixating on one’s spirit,
One loses it.

Seeking the path of non-action
Yet clinging to traces of existence—
This is why the artificer brings ruin,
The grasper invites loss.

Therefore, the sage acts without acting,
Generates all things,
Does not cling, yet directs desire—
Like two craftsmen building a high tower,
Or Heaven and Earth nurturing mighty trees,
Naturally, without effort.
Non-action brings no ruin,
Non-clinging brings no loss.

Virtue and power do not envy,
Divine clarity does not harm,
Harmony knows no obstruction,
Greatness knows no defeat.
Life and death follow their course,
Fortune and misfortune find their due.
Those who align with the Way attain it,
Those who stray from it suffer it.

When people face ruin,
It is because they abandon spontaneity
And rely on cleverness and strength,
Rejecting their nature while embracing their undoing.

Why is this so?
Because they seek what they seek,
Desire what they desire.

Men’s undertakings often falter at completion
Because they cling to desire and lose their foundation.

If one could truly
Treasure the end as the beginning,
Act without desiring,
Guard what is not to be occupied,
Move before the origin,
Return before the start—
Acting as if not acting,
Having as if not having,
Though seemingly unaccomplished,
Things naturally align.

The beginning may stray from the Way,
Yet the end will never lose it—
Thus there is no failure.

When the spirit is disturbed and the essence muddied,
When clarity fails to reach and action misses its mark,
When stillness loses what it seeks—
This is the work of wealth and learning.

Only those who refine their emotions and transform their nature,
Who delight in desire without desire,
Who find joy in action without action—
These are the Way and virtue.

Wealth agitates the spirit,
Learning breeds deceit.
If one desires not to desire, wealth loses its power;
If one learns not to learn, daily loss returns to truth—
Thus aligning with the Dao and virtue,
No multitude of faults can persist.

Therefore, cherish the Way as one cherishes a beloved,
Abhor wealth as one abhors losing one’s own body,
Ponder thought beyond thought,
Seek what is beyond seeking—
Clear and all-encompassing,
Learning what cannot be known,
Skilled in shaping all things,
Yet knowing what cannot be done—
Turning from what the masses pursue,
Returning to the void and the formless.

Desiring not to desire, one enters the boundless mystery;
Learning not to learn, one reaches the utmost subtlety—
Penetrating what the enlightened cannot fathom,
Exhausting what the common cannot measure,
Achieving what the accomplished cannot do,
Attaining what none can possess.

The mind profound, the form serene,
Lying like a corpse, standing like withered wood—
No thought, no deliberation,
As if unaware of all things.

Let things follow their nature,
Let affairs unfold of themselves—
Empty, still, and solitary,
The body uninvolved,
All things in their proper place—
Towering like a mound, vast like the ocean’s expanse,
Raised and discarded, ever contrary to the world—
All things respond in kind,
Thus attaining depth and distance.

The world’s great reversal,
Moving with the divine transformation,
Aiding Heaven, assisting Earth,
Daring not to create what is good.

The true practitioner of the Way is manifest.

The ancients who excelled in the Way
Governed themselves thus—
Not to enlighten the people with knowledge,
But to blind them, sealing their hearts.

The people’s difficulty in governance cannot be measured,
For their wisdom abandons loyalty and sincerity.

To rule with wisdom benefits the state but harms the people;
Not to rule with wisdom preserves the natural purity—
The state’s blessing, the people’s survival.

Knowing these two paths—calamity and blessing—
These are the fundamental patterns of right and wrong.

Always knowing the patterns to apply to the ruler’s body—
This is called the profound virtue, unseen and unheard.

Profound virtue is deep, unseen,
Far, unimaginable,
Contrary to things, distinct from the spirit—
Until it reaches the perfect harmony of the world.

**The Conclusion:**
Dao and virtue, divine and mundane,
Pure and impure, the Great Harmony—
Heaven, Earth, and all things,
Like roots and branches.

Numbers follow in sequence,
Qi transformations connect—
Success and decline, fortune and misfortune,
All share in the same fate.

The intent of Dao and virtue,
The heart of Heaven and Earth—
Peaceful generation, joyful repose,
Hatred and injury, life and death—
Thus the Sage is named King of all things.

Benefiting others brings their blessing,
Harming them brings their fear—
The Sage fears greatly,
Fearful of future calamity,
Deeply tracing its origins—
None better than returning to nature,
For nature’s path lies in the formless.

How may this be made clear?
Zhuangzi said:
Heaven and Earth do not know the workings of virtue,
Yet they act accordingly;
All things do not see Heaven and Earth’s methods,
Yet they cannot be preserved;
The masses do not recognize the ruler’s intentions,
Yet they may be at ease;
The limbs and orifices do not understand the heart’s guidance,
Yet they remain whole.

The ruler of all things is like the heart to the body.
The heart to the body—
What comes first or last?
Flowing through the blood and vessels,
Present everywhere,
Above and below, inside and out—
Nothing escapes its influence.
Moving with change, containing the spirit,
Balanced within, contrary without—
Thus all is preserved.

Therefore, the ancient emperors and kings
Followed Dao and virtue,
Organized divine and mundane,
Unified purity and impurity,
Led the Great Harmony—
Not with innate knowledge to act,
Not to open the world or guide customs,
But to dull the people’s senses,
Seal their hearts,
Prevent them from knowing,
Return them to nature.

The ancients who excelled in the Way
Did not enlighten the people,
But sought to blind them.

Thus, placing the people in the bright and clear,
While dwelling in the murky and obscure,
Teaching them ignorance,
Guiding them with the formless—
Filial piety and brotherly love unseen,
Ren and righteousness unexalted,
The ruler without honor,
The wise without renown.

Teaching without teaching,
Flowing through the four seas,
Doing without doing,
Reaching the eight directions—
Moving with Heaven and Earth in rhythm,
Resting with Dao and virtue in harmony,
All things flourishing together,
Each knowing its place—
Names and realities arising together,
Each fulfilling its role.

Harmonious qi flows freely,
The world in childlike simplicity—
No knowledge, no desire,
No action, no achievement—
The heart like wood and soil,
The will like dead ashes—
Seeing no difference, no fortune or misfortune,
Thus the people are easily governed and the world may be at peace.

Therefore, what benefits the people is their ease,
What sustains them is their life—
Yet the people stray from ease and life, making governance difficult,
Because of their knowing.

When the people know, they desire to live;
Desiring to live, they begin their pursuits;
Pursuits begun, fame and gain arise;
Fame and gain arise, contention and strife follow;
Strife and contention breed great deceit;
Great deceit breeds difficulty in governance.

The people’s difficulty in governance stems from their excess of knowledge.

Thus, ruling with knowledge,
The world spawns cleverness, deceit, and artifice,
Strange things multiply,
Desires know no end,
Luxury and licentiousness cease not,
Deceit and perversion flourish,
The bold and the cunning vie for dominance,
Names proliferate in the valleys—
Great calamity arises.

Ministers deceive their lords,
Sons rebel against their fathers,
White is called black,
Absence is called presence,
Names and realities invert,
Banditry and slaughter ensue.

Unsettled and restless, none find peace,
Light and reckless, none remain whole—
Armies march lightly, the world turns to war,
The dead numberless, rivers run with blood.

Grief and resentment stir the heavens,
Stars scatter, sun and moon dim,
Yin and yang lose order,
All things are harmed—
Mountains wither, valleys dry,
Thousands of miles of barren earth,
The world in ruin,
Until people eat one another.

The fault lies not with Heaven,
For the Sage above delights in wisdom and instructs the myriad people.
When the excess of favoring wisdom reaches this point,
It is said that governing with wisdom is the ruin of the state—
A truth that cannot be false.

Abandon cleverness and artifice,
Let virtue be pure and simple.
Know alone, ponder alone,
Desire nothing seen.
Follow the people’s heart,
Close their ears and eyes to falsehoods.
Eat no five flavors,
Wear no five colors.
The ruler, like Heaven and Earth,
The people, like grasses and trees.
Dwell in rocky retreats, find peace in valleys,
Drink water, eat grass, seek no grains.
Know mother, recognize father,
Yet see no kin.
Stuporous and unknowing,
Unaware of east or west,
Men and women take no pleasure in one another,
Fathers and sons feel no fondness.
Wood and stone are not despised,
Gold and jade are not prized.
Clusters live together in harmony,
The world unites in one mind,
The eight extremes share purpose,
The nine regions align in wind.
Borer-beetles do not act,
Poisonous beasts do not arise,
Spiritual dragons dwell among people,
Qilin and phoenixes roam the courts.

Gentle winds blow,
Sweet springs trickle,
Sweet dew falls,
Red grasses flourish,
Fine millet thrives lush,
All things live eternally.

This is not Heaven’s blessing,
But the ruler’s knowing of the Unknowable,
Naming the Unnameable.
The Unknowing-Knowing,
The Unnameable-Name,
Aligns with the Dao—
How could it be otherwise?

Thus, dimmed wisdom recognizes stupidity,
And aligns with the Dao’s essence.
Knowing stupidity, knowing wisdom,
Both align with the Dao’s intent.
Governance follows this,
Sometimes bringing harm, sometimes benefit.
To discern harm and benefit,
Great harmony naturally arises.
To grasp benefit and harm,
All things naturally align.

To govern with wisdom brings calamity and precedent;
To govern without wisdom brings blessing and virtue.
These two paths serve as models.
Ever knowing these models,
This is called *Xuan De* (玄德).

Thus, the recognition of stupidity and wisdom
Overcomes all obstacles.
In purity and stillness, a tranquil foundation,
A hidden blessing for all beings,
Unseen by the world—
Thus it is called *Xuan De*.

*Xuan De* is profound, immeasurable;
Distant, beyond reach;
Opposed to things, none can overcome it.
It is said: *Xuan De* is profound, distant, opposed to things.
When *Xuan De* descends,
It drifts, surges, retreats, indistinct—
Opposing things in action,
Harmonizing with virtue and the Way,
Guiding spirit and clarity,
Embracing all lands,
Unbounded in scope.
Beyond the six extremes, within the minutest measure,
No place is untouched by its virtue and benevolence,
Preserving life and nature,
Ending at Heaven’s appointed time,
Nurturing what is natural.
This is called *Great Harmony*.

**The Chapter on Rivers and Seas**
Rivers and seas become kings of all valleys
Because they are thus—
They are below all streams,
Thus they rule all valleys without submission.

Therefore, the Sage says of the enlightened ruler:
To place oneself above the people is to occupy the highest position,
Yet to speak in humility aligns with the people’s hearts.
To act before the people is to avoid their calamities,
Yet to place oneself last ensures their security.
To lead the people is to be their model,
Yet to harm none clarifies one’s virtue.
The world willingly follows,
Yet the ruler does not know he is being offered—
Not to compete for position,
Thus none can contend, none can prevail.

**The Principle of Return:**
Virtue and the Way do not create the myriad things,
Yet the myriad things arise naturally.
Heaven and Earth do not gather the myriad beings,
Yet the myriad beings find refuge in them.
Natural things do not seek to rule,
Yet things rule themselves.

Thus, Heaven and Earth, vast and myriad, are ruled by the Dao;
The myriad suns blazing, are ruled by Heaven;
The yin essence flowing, is ruled by Earth;
The naked dwell in caves, ruled by the Sage;
The winged soar in emptiness, ruled by the Divine Phoenix;
The furred tread the earth, ruled by the Qilin;
The scaled dwell in waters, ruled by the Spirit Dragon;
The shelled dwell in marshes, ruled by the Sacred Tortoise;
All streams converge, ruled by the River and Sea.

These nine rulers
Do not claim dominion over things,
Yet things return to them.
Without laws or measures,
Yet things govern themselves.
Without benevolence or righteousness,
Yet things attach to them.
Without exerting wisdom or strength,
Yet things fear them.

Why is this so?
They embody the Dao, harmonize with nature,
Do nothing to things,
Yet things transform under their influence.

Thus, the River and Sea’s rule
Is not through accumulating virtue or deeds,
Nor through flowing spirit and grace,
Nor through bestowing favors to win allegiance;
Nor through upholding rites and propriety,
Nor through eloquence and cunning,
Nor through displaying wisdom and skill,
Nor through extraordinary actions or schemes,
Nor through wielding might and terror,
Nor through exhausting life’s energies to control them—
But in stillness and humility, waiting below,
In non-action and non-seeking,
All streams come naturally.

The streams do not hear of the Sea’s beauty,
Yet they are transformed by its virtue and return in reverence.
Nor does the Sea bind or teach them,
Nor set paths or mark directions—
Yet water, piercing metal, shattering stone,
Boring cliffs, toppling mountains,
Rushing over hills,
Hastens to the Sea without return—
Form and nature align,
Things act naturally.

From this, it is seen:
Great is the Way of humility and self-effacement,
Harm cannot injure it,
Wisdom cannot seize it,
Strong without battle,
Mighty without coercion,
Silent and doing nothing,
Yet trading with all things.

Valleys are low but not east or west,
Thus they reach their end without exhaustion.
Rivers and seas dwell below but are not vast,
Thus they rule without ceasing.
Rivers and seas rule all valleys
Because they excel in humility—
Truly so.

Thus, the enlightened king and sage,
Desiring to honor the people,
Follows nature’s essence,
Nurtures virtue’s grace,
Speaks in humble words, bows with respect,
Associates with the common folk,
Views himself as the earth,
Serves the people as Heaven,
Illuminated in solitary knowing yet unfathomable,
Outstanding in singular ability yet untraceable,
Deep in insight, broad in reach, yet impassable,
Clear and bright, flowing yet unobstructed—
Not to dominate things,
But to follow, placing the people first.

The Sage, though possessing such abilities,
Does not place himself above others—
For he speaks humbly, does not lead—
For he follows with his own person.
Thus, the people willingly follow without tiring.

Therefore, the people tread upon him as upon the earth,
Trust him as though he were divine.
Ever above them, his land aligns with Heaven’s decree.

If he seeks to lead, yet dwells in obscurity,
Holds the highest honor, yet lives long and unharmed,
Finds joy in carefree existence—
Then he abandons ambition, forsakes self,
To ensure the people’s ease.
He labors while the people rest,
Retreats while the people advance,
Stands above while the people thrive,
Leads while the people find security.

Because the people thrive, they revere him without burden,
Because the people are secure, they follow him without distress.
The reason they revere him without burden
Is that he benefits them—
Thus, though he stands before them, they suffer no harm.

Therefore, the world pushes him upward,
Draws him forward,
Delights in him without weariness,
Takes joy in him without satiety.

Thus, the Sage’s rule is not one of seeking the people—
The people seek him.
Not one of benefiting the people—
The people benefit from him.
Not one of honoring the people—
The people honor him.
Not one of leading the people—
The people lead through him.

Thus, he can exhaust hardship, adapt to change,
Revive decay, rectify chaos,
Achieving supreme peace,
Above aligning with virtue and power,
Below encompassing the divine and mysterious,
Descending into the boundless,
Embracing the unfathomable,
Galloping through Heaven and Earth,
Ranging across yin and yang.

Why is this so?
Because he abandons the mind’s designs and follows with his body.

Thus, the virtue of non-contention,
Relies on the people’s strength,
Aligns with the Dao’s transformations,
Extends with the divine’s extremes—
Only those who abandon knowledge
Can follow its principles.

How could anyone contend with such a one?
Therefore, royal affairs proceed naturally,
Cannot be arbitrarily initiated,
Are attained through complete vitality,
Sustained by proper order,
Sage wisdom is innate,
Governance follows the Way.

To lose the order is to fail in royal affairs,
To abandon the Way is to misalign nature’s course.
Thus, the Sage trusts the Dao, not the self,
Follows the Dao, not the heart,
Acts not for self, but for others,
Does not claim the world—
Thus, the world contends to serve him.

Truly, these words are sincere.
The treasure of a nation,
Ten thousand emperors and kings cannot enact—
Only those who grasp even a fraction
Become the sovereign of all things.

The origin without end,
Returning to exhaustion and constraint.
To harmonize with its subtlety,
Without incurring self-harm.

This is called *clinging to constancy*,
Boundless and eternal.

The world calls me *manifest*—
The world calls me *with* and names me—
Greatly resembling the unworthy,
Formless as a shadow.

For only the great virtue is resplendent,
Thus resembling the unworthy—
Returning to the nature of illness.
If resembling, it is honored by the multitude,
Yet its end is small—
It defies the natural order.

I possess three treasures—
The Dao’s application.
Hold them and preserve them—
The heart’s origin.

First: *compassion*—
The initial injury.
Second: *frugality*—
Moderating oneself.
Third: *not daring to lead the world*—
Trusting what comes after.

Compassion thus generates courage—
The weak become strong.
Frugality thus expands—
Modesty yields growth.
Not daring to lead the world,
Trusting nature’s course,
Thus one can perfect the vessel—
The later born surpass the first.

Now, if one abandons compassion for rigidity,
Frugality for ostentation,
And "trusting what comes after" for leading,
Then death ensues—
The great fate is lost.

Compassion in war brings victory—
The people follow sincerely.
In defense, it secures—
The people’s loyalty is steadfast.
When Heaven intends to save,
It shields from calamity—
Enveloping life within.

The skilled warrior does not rely on force,
The skilled fighter does not rage,
The skilled victor does not retaliate,
The skilled ruler wins hearts—
Thus, their words and deeds are revered below.

This is called the virtue of *non-contention*—
Blessings spontaneously arise.

Using others’ strength to achieve their deeds—
This is called *aligning with Heaven*,
Matching Heaven’s course.
The ancient ultimate sages exhausted the Dao.

**Reflections:**
Things may share similarity yet differ,
Or differ yet share similarity,
Or appear false yet be true,
Or true yet be false—
Thus the sage knows no woe,
While the multitude suffers and grieves.

The sun and moon rise and set—
Different yet equally bright.
The wise and foolish share form,
Yet their hearts differ.
The sage harmonizes with the world without distress,
While the petty man seeks distinction—
Thus, he bears sorrow.

Hence it is said:
There is similarity within difference,
Truth within falsehood.

How does one demonstrate this?
Zhuangzi said:
The rising and setting of the sun and moon—
Their brightness is the same.
Human life and death—
Their form is identical.
The seasons’ divisions—
Their benefits are equal.
The sage and the commoner—
Their appearance is alike.
The open-minded and the closed—
Their deeds are the same.
The Daoist and the infant—
Their efficacy is identical.

All these things,
Though internally varied,
Externally align—
None but the sage can clarify them.

Thus, the world harbors suspicions,
Dazzled by false appearances,
Entangled in conflicting judgments—
Hence the sage appears unworthy.

The world calls me greatly unworthy.
Why so?
Those who grasp the Dao—
Externally absent, internally present,
Study to transform their nature,
Act to govern themselves,
Substantial yet appearing empty,
Mysterious and indistinct,
As if without purpose,
Speech sparse, demeanor humble,
Appearance crude and vulgar,
Yet their essence is boundless,
Their nature transcendent,
Quiet and withdrawn,
As if without end,
Avoiding renown, escaping influence,
Resting with the divine in rise and fall,
Embodying the Dao, walking in harmony,
All things in accord,
Not conforming to the times,
Friendly with Heaven and Earth.

The multitude, however, feigns and deceives,
Considers straightforwardness as ugliness,
Suffers from misdirection,
Calls it illness.

Only the great thus appears unworthy—
Hence the world deems it sickness.

The petty man is otherwise:
Wide learning, many knowledges,
Using wisdom to gain fame,
Unusual conduct, conspicuous deeds,
Creating doubt about virtue,
Deceiving the world, ordering customs,
Adorning speech, embellishing appearance,
Humbling himself to curry favor,
Anticipating intentions to win hearts,
Forming factions, harboring thieves.
Laboring little yet receiving heavy rewards,
Achieving few deeds yet holding high rank,
While the nation grows poor and his family rich,
The ruler weakens while he grows powerful.
Wielding power to create change,
Seizing advantage in prosperity,
His name and influence resound,
Shaking distant lands,
Arrogant, extravagant, violent,
Unrestrained, unchecked,
Compliant when favored, rebellious when opposed,
Actions costing lives, inaction breeding corruption,
Opening his mouth to harm the people.

This is what the world honors,
What society calls *resemblance*.

If so, then:
The Dao departs,
The divine withdraws,
Heaven and Earth abhor,
Yin and Yang reject,
Kindred reject him,
The people do not follow,
His actions meet no end,
His stillness yields no gain,
Life brings harm,
Death brings blessing—
The multitude, misled, leads others astray,
Their gains are meager,
Their days prolonged.

Thus, the petty man’s *resemblance* endures in triviality.

But those who grasp the Dao are otherwise:
Their body is empty, yet compassion accumulates,
They regard all things as themselves.

First: *compassion*.
Restraining form, moderating appearance,
Returning to subtlety.

Second: *frugality*.
Silent and withdrawn, trusting what comes after,
Not leading the world,
Harmonizing with nature’s course.

Third: *not daring to lead the world*.

Their actions and stillness contrast with the multitude,
Their comings and goings pass through different gates,
They do not use courage to be courageous—
Thus, they do not rage, yet the world fears them.
*Compassion thus generates courage.*

They do not use expansiveness to expand—
Thus, they do not bestow, yet the world follows them.
*Frugality thus expands.*

They do not lead—
Thus, without speaking, the world reveres them.
*Not daring to lead the world, thus perfecting the vessel.*

Hence, compassion transforms into courage,
Frugality into expansiveness,
"Trusting what comes after" into leadership—
Contrary to harmony, opposing the divine,
Defying nature’s course,
Blessings distance themselves,
Calamities draw near,
The great fate is severed,
Divine essence disperses,
Heaven and Earth cannot sustain,
The Dao and virtue cannot endure,
At death, unaware,
Blaming fate, reproaching Heaven.

Not because fate is meager,
Nor because men are malevolent—
But because they revel in arrogance,
Discard the Dao, and rely on force.

This is called:
Abandoning compassion for rigidity,
Frugality for ostentation,
"Trusting what comes after" for leadership—
Thus, death ensues.

For compassion as conduct—
Most harmonious and true,
In action, it mobilizes strength,
In stillness, it aligns with Heaven’s will,
Humbling the weak, ruling all things,
Rectifying the world, saving the people,
Harmonizing Heaven and humanity,
In war, undefeatable,
In defense, unassailable.

The benevolent one—
When waging war, triumphs;
When defending, stands firm—
This is its nature.

Why so?
Heaven and Earth arise together,
Transformations endless, without bound.

On the day of battle,
The Earth stirs beneath,
The Heavens tremble above,
Heaven sends omens of strife,
Earth unleashes winds of chaos,
Ghosts and spirits manifest,
To foes, misfortune comes;
It aids my generals and ministers,
It aids my myriad people,
Yet enrages my soldiers,
Extending to all living things.

Oxen lose their threshing,
Horses lose their grain,
Birds falter in flight,
Beasts stumble on land,
Tigers and rhinos may be fought,
Snatching birds may be led—
Foes in terror, crouching beneath ambush.

Heaven’s intent to save me,
Is through benevolence as my shield.

Thus, the worthy counselor to a victorious general
Does not rely on strength or grandeur,
Nor on rigidity or harshness,
But yields to softness and weakness, fearing force#9,
And the enemy then perishes.

The skilled soldier does not wield force.
In battle, he harms only outward intent,
Cherishing peace and harmony,
Declining small matters to trust in what follows,
In action and stillness, conforming to Heaven’s will,
Not stirring wrath to provoke anger,
Nor using force to raise armies.
The skilled warrior does not rage.

To overcome the enemy,
He always acts contrary to expectation,
Plans and movements unseen,
To capture the enemy’s resolve,
Actions spring from their own resources,
Transformations arise from their own deeds—
Reverse and overturn them,
To handle their unexpected moves.

Thus, when they act deceitfully, I stand upright,
When they speak, I listen,
When they grow angry, I rejoice,
When they move, I remain still,
Opening what they seek to exploit,
To preserve their lives.

The skilled victor does not contend.

In employing men,
I speak to them with humility,
Show them their benefits,
Explain to them with sincerity,
And let them come of their own accord.
The skilled leader serves below.

Thus, without contention or demand,
I gain the people’s intent,
I follow the people’s hearts,
Holding their key principles and prohibitions.
This is the virtue of non-contention.

When others scatter, I remain united,
When foes do not wish to perish, yet cannot,
When I do not wish to persist, yet cannot—
This is the power of employing men.

At such times,
The Dao is without form,
Virtue takes root,
Divine clarity serves as the standard,
Great harmony as the measure,
Pure and impure as my domain,
All things as my children,
The Three Lights as my aides,
The Four Seasons as my assistants,
Stillness as the origin of all things,
Movement as the beginning of transformation—
All beings entrust themselves to it,
Without fear of blame or retribution,
My virtue aligns with Heaven’s,
Enduring forever without peril.

From ancient to modern,
The Way of the sage and the wise,
In transformations from beginning to end,
From Heaven to kingship,
All derive from this.

This is called:
The ancient peak of matching Heaven.

**Chapter on the Use of Arms**

The use of arms has a saying: *Chen Ji Gang* (陈纪纲) teaches it.

I do not dare to be the aggressor,
Nor to provoke the first strike—
Yet I follow as the guest,
And let the people act.

I do not dare to advance an inch,
Nor to retreat a foot in despair—
Yet I retreat a foot,
And hope they will return.

This is called:
**Action without action, countering with reverse.**
**Repelling without arms, yet causing no harm.**
**Seizing without weapons, foes find no response.**
**Yet when facing the enemy, there is none before me.**

**The greatest calamity is to slight the enemy and rely on oneself alone.**
**To slight the enemy risks the loss of my treasure—**
**The natural order of things.**

**Guidance:**

The Dao is ever-present, yet its presence does not act;
The Way is ever-true, yet its truth does not force.
Harmonize with nature, yield to weakness,
Yet embrace the great power within.
Nurture all beings, none can defy—
No form, yet the teacher of all things.
Who attains it finds security,
Who loses it faces peril.
Heaven and Earth embody it,
And endure without decay.

**How may one emulate it?**

Zhuangzi said:
**If there is no yin without yang, all things would not flourish;**
**If there is no yang without yin, all things would not complete.**

From this perspective,
**Power without virtue cannot govern the people;**
**Virtue without power risks the collapse of ancestral shrines.**
**Lacking both virtue and power is to invite disaster—**
**When fate shifts and changes, the ruler dies,
And the nation perishes.**

Thus, the ruler is the **vital core of the state**,
And the military is the **manifest power of the nation**.

Between Heaven and Earth,
All nations rise and fall,
Great or small, wise or foolish—
All wish to be sovereign.
The wise submit when their wisdom is exhausted,
The strong yield when their strength is spent.
They do not have excess power,
Yet kneel willingly as subjects.

Hence, the enlightened kings and sage rulers,
**Follow the Dao and emulate Heaven**,
**Prioritize tranquility and purity**,
**Maintain harmony and compliance**,
**Adapt to circumstances as their foundation**,
**Uphold sincerity and trust as their essence**,
**Align name and reality as their standard**,
**Employ rewards and punishments as their framework**,
**Balance virtue on the left and power on the right**,
**To counter misfortune**—
**The world looks to them for order,**
**None dare to harm or defy them.**
Thus, **the nation is preserved and the people are whole**.

**Virtue and power, like Heaven and Earth, yin and yang,**
**Are the martial and civil, surface and depth—**
**Balanced and harmonious,**
**Hidden in the mysterious realm,**
**Only employed when absolutely necessary.**

**Thus, when a ruler loses the Dao,**
**Loves war and harms himself,**
**Neglects proper governance,**
**And indulges in corruption,**
**He grows arrogant and extravagant,**
**Disregards laws and weakens discipline,**
**Adorns palaces and lavishes on horses,**
**Builds lofty towers and vast enclosures,**
**Pursues music and beauty—**
**He slaughters loyal advisors,**
**Honors favorites and beauties,**
**Disrespects ancestral shrines,**
**Insults elders,**
**Oppresses with cruelty and violence,**
**Leaves widows and orphans to perish,**
**Defies Heaven and Earth,**
**Violates the order of yin and yang,**
**Disfigures virtue and power,**
**Shatters divine clarity,**
**Dissolves harmonious qi into filth,**
**And disrupts the natural flow of transformation—**
**Then winter thunders and summer frosts arise,**
**And all things wither and die.**

**With armies clashing and strategies unraveling,**
**Plots bring only misfortune—**
**Great nations tremble in fear,**
**Small nations flee in terror,**
**The elderly and weak scatter,**
**Weeping as they depart—**
**The world seethes with resentment,**
**All people long for peace,**
**Yet rise in rebellion,**
**And I am left to follow their lead.**

**Why is this so?**

It is because **their ancestors**,
**Each possessed divine virtue and wisdom,**
**Communed with Heaven and Earth,**
**And labored for the benefit of all people.**
Thus, **they were granted the Mandate of Heaven,**
**Received the land and noble lineage,**
**Elevated as rulers,**
**Their glory shining upon their forebears,**
**Their deeds passed down to future generations.**

**This is the heart of Heaven and Earth,**
**The enduring merit of ten thousand years.**
Yet **those who inherit this legacy**,
**Do not strive to humble themselves,**
**Refine their essence,**
**Or cultivate the Dao and virtue—**
**Instead, they ignore small virtues and embrace small vices,**
**Growing worse day by day, month by month.**
**Ancestral shrines crumble,**
**The nation becomes a ruin,**
**Clans scatter and disperse,**
**The young have no refuge—**
**Ghosts and spirits, orphaned souls,**
**Find no resting place.**

**Alas! How can such a nation not decline?**

Thus, I instruct **my brave and bold warriors,**
And speak to **my soldiers.**
**The use of arms has a saying.**

**Unarm the soldiers and release the weapons,**
**Yet let them rest and recover.**
**Exhausted by battle, their spirits shift—**
**They may yet repent and change,**
**Transform their appearance and ease their burdens.**

**I do not dare to be the aggressor,**
**Yet I follow as the guest.**
**To march forward without return is to become a thief to the world—**
**The people suffer to the extreme,**
**Their wealth exhausted, strength spent,**
**And woes grow daily.**
**Heaven responds in kind,**
**Disaster gathers upon the land—**
**Though I wish to spare them,**
**Destruction comes naturally.**
**Heaven and people align in heart,**
**I cannot overcome them.**

**I do not dare to advance an inch,**
**Nor retreat a foot in despair—**
**Yet I retreat a foot,**
**And hope they will return.**

Thus, **the mission is accomplished,**
**Yet the spirit is weary;**
**The body moves forward,**
**Yet the resolve lingers behind.**
**The form opposes my will,**
**The deed defies my purpose.**
**Action without action.**

**Pity those sage ancestors,**
**And lament the suffering of the people—**
**They had no fault before Heaven,**
**Yet why did they meet such ruin?**

Though it seems sudden,
**The lives of the people depend on war—**
**When orders are given with sincerity and trust,**
**They must be obeyed.**
**Those who submit first are rewarded,**
**Those who submit late are harmed,**
**The small nations are benefited,**
**The great nations thrive—**
**Those who surrender their lands are granted titles,**
**Those who yield their cities are given fiefs.**
**If cities and lands do not surrender,**
**Do not despair if they are not yet conquered.**

**The guilty are pardoned,**
**The capable are appointed,**
**The elderly and weak are provided for,**
**The dead are given proper burial.**
**Repelling without arms shows no harm.**

**Virtue and benevolence spread far and wide,**
**Love and harmony flow among the people,**
**Kindness and grace bind them together—**
**All hearts are uplifted,**
**And without a word, their spirits align with mine.**
**Seizing without weapons:**

**If my three armies share my resolve,**
**The treacherous become my messengers,**
**The thieves become my laborers—**
**They teach me their strategies,**
**And reveal their terrain.**
**Using their own resources,**
**My clever schemes succeed.**

**Laws are not harsh,**
**Dangerous obstacles are left unguarded—**
**Heaven and people cooperate,**
**Victory comes like the divine.**
**No enemy remains before me,**
**No strategy is lost—**
**Though the foe be many,**
**They provoke me,**
**And when the two armies stand apart,**
**They face none before them.**

**Yet there is no enemy:**

**Though war is fully prepared,**
**The enemy cannot be changed.**
**To change the enemy breeds deceit,**
**And when defeat comes, I lose advantage—**
**Fortune departs, calamity arrives,**
**And I am despised by Heaven.**
**The greatest calamity is to insult the enemy.**
Thus, **even if I gain Heaven’s favor**
**And the aid of the people,**
**I still hold them with concern,**
**And grasp them with caution—**
**Exiting peril, seizing opportunity,**
**My encampments are fortified,**
**My resting places secure,**
**I rely on water and grass,**
**Fill gaps and block flaws,**
**And maintain distance from the enemy.**

「If I insult the enemy, I shall perish—
Thus, I must act as I do.

The Dao’s flow is formless,
Its stratagems emerge unseen,
Its victories unfold endlessly,
Its battles leave no trace.
Profound and subtle, its transformations know no beginning,
Yet it remains close to me—
I do not grasp its workings,
Nor do they comprehend my power.
How, then, can they benefit me?

Therefore, the household dwells in ease and finds joy,
The disciple rejoices and takes delight.
When people harbor utmost sincerity,
They treat me as their own child—
Leaving home and crossing borders,
They gather like crowds at a marketplace.
They toil in farming and weaving with vigor,
Rest at dusk and rise at dawn,
Their movements follow disciplined formation,
No one dares act alone,
Supplying teacher and pupil
As if honoring father and mother.

Weighing advantage to claim victory,
The enemy rises not.
No battle fought, yet all under Heaven submit,
No assault launched, yet the feudal lords bow.
Heaven and Earth shelter and nurture all,
Sun and Moon illuminate and reveal all—
Majestic and boundless,
Each content in its own domain.

Why so?—
Compassion and mercy set things in motion,
Aligning with Heaven’s intent,
Not daring to act against its will.
When armies face each other,
The merciful prevail.

**My words are easy to understand—**
**Yet none can know the unknowable.**
**My actions are simple to follow—**
**Yet none can emulate the unemulated.**

Yet my words have a lineage,
My deeds a sovereign principle—
Unspoken yet inherent,
Natural yet unforced.
Only those who fail to recognize me
And differ from my ways
Do not comprehend me,
Do not affirm my truth.
Few know me—
Common folk say, *"Then you are noble, you alone are true."*

Thus, the Sage—
The wise ruler—
Clad in coarse garments, humble in body,
Yet treasures virtue within, rich in spirit.
**Pointing to the source:**
What is formless and soundless yet guides all things naturally?
The **Dao/Way** and the **Divine**#5.
What is formed and audible yet guides all things naturally?
Earth and Heaven.
The **Divine’s** transformations surge and flow,
Heaven and Earth speak in silence.
The surge transforms all without exception,
The silence reveals all without fail.
**Divine qi**#6 and vitality pass on,
Responding to each other’s impulses—
Returning to boundless emptiness,
Exquisitely subtle and wondrous,
They rest in nature.

They lead all things without end.

Thus, **spoken words are but tools of expression—**
**Action is the ruin of authenticity.**
**Non-action, no words—**
**This is the apex of achievement**
**And the key to enduring life.**

Therefore, the Sage speaks of what is unspeakable,
Acts without doing—
Words to silence words,
Actions to halt actions.
**The path of ceasing speech:**
Discard the heart and mind’s designs,
**The art of halting action:**
Abandon human cleverness and wisdom.
Become foolish and guileless,
Know nothing, desire nothing.
Without desire comes stillness,
Stillness brings emptiness,
Emptiness yields substance,
Substance births the **Divine**#7.
Movement returns to the **Great Primordial**#8,
Stillness to nature—
Preserve the self, safeguard the realm,
Wealth and honor fade not,
All creatures fulfill their aspirations,
And attain lasting life.

These are words easy to grasp,
Actions simple to follow—
Yet Heaven and Earth cannot fathom them,
Cannot emulate them.
Why so?

The rulers of this world delight in knowledge,
Strive to please their hearts,
See not the Great Dao,
Recognize not nature—
They take action as action,
Speak words as words,
Exhausting knowledge to spawn deeds,
Seeking comfort in their own inclinations,
Yet they deem this as the common way,
And suffer afflictions all their lives—
Their essence fades, their emotions shift,
They sink deep into confusion and stray far from truth,
Their vitality dulls, their spirit unsettles,
Their bodies appear solid yet their inner selves are hollow,
Forced silence breeds guilt,
Forced stillness invites calamity.

Thus, they look yet do not see,
They are told yet do not hear—
Not from spite, but because they believe otherwise.
They refuse loyal counsel,
Not from spite toward themselves,
But because they think no such principle exists,
And so they do not follow it.

The Sage’s words spring from nature,
Take root in the **Divine**#9—
Ever dwelling in their opposite#10,
Between silence and utterance.
Exquisitely subtle and wondrous,
They return to nature—
Bright yet as unseen,
Heard yet as unheard,
Permeating yet appearing blocked,
Reaching yet seeming confined.

Their deeds begin in nature,
Flow through the **Divine**—
Ever abiding in harmony,
Between action and inaction.
**Pure, still, yielding, weak—**
**Movement refined, actions delicate—**
**Simplicity, ease, retreat, and self-effacement**
**Return to non-action.**

This is the **source of words, the master of deeds.**

Emptiness unites with the **Dao/Way**,
Serenity dwells in life,
Timely harmony secures the realm,
Establishing teachings to nurture the people.
**Nourish with no desire—**
**Guide with nature—**
**Bestow with Heaven and Earth—**
**Grant with mountains and rivers—**
**Enrich with years and seasons—**
**Honor with existence—**
**Protect with no worry—**
**Ensure with no calamity—**
Without desire, nothing is lost,
Without joy, nothing is sustained.
People without a ruler,
A ruler without people—
Perish through knowledge and cleverness,
Rely on the **Dao/Way**, lean on Heaven—
All nations in harmony,
United under one sovereign.

This is the grandest of undertakings,
The most exalted of achievements—
Yet the world deems it otherwise.
The **Dao/Way** makes it so,
Logic knows no deception.
The wise are clouded by their own understanding,
Thus they refuse to believe.

The world cannot know me,
Not because my **Dao/Way** is insignificant,
Nor because my deeds are shallow,
Nor because the world delights in ruin and evil,
Rejoices in disaster and misfortune—
Heaven’s nature opposes mine,
Human desires diverge from my truth,
Wisdom ensnared by desires
Endures weakness all its life;
**Divine qi** does not affirm me,
Hearts and minds do not accept my words.

Thus, they cannot see my clarity,
Cannot hear my insight—
Deep words invite slander,
Great deeds invite reproach,
Unique vision is unused by the world,
Unheard wisdom shames the people.
Deeds that align with the **Divine** are not embraced by convention,
Achievements that match Heaven and Earth please not the masses.

Few know me.

**The ultimate discourse, the greatest words—**
They encompass all variations,
Grasp all directions,
Divide even the finest distinctions,
Illuminate the void beyond form and perception—
Boundless and thorough,
Yet return to **obscurity and ambiguity**#11.

This is what petty scholars cannot hear,
And narrow-minded folk cannot attain.»

The lofty wild goose soars all day,
Yet never knows what lies beyond the cosmos.

Those who craft laws and bind themselves to teachings,
Study for years, debate a lifetime,
Yet never grasp the vastness of **virtue/power**.

Moreover, there are things even the **Divine** cannot comprehend,
Things even Heaven and Earth cannot govern—
How much more so for those who cling to common doctrines,
Who fail to perceive the fundamental principles?

Thus, what the multitude despises as worthless
Is what those who attain the **Dao/Way** alone uphold.
Therefore, I am esteemed.

Hence, the Sage knows yet does not act,
Is capable yet does not assume responsibility,
Practices benevolence and righteousness yet does not proclaim them,
Is enlightened yet does not name it so,
Is steadfast yet does not flaunt it,
Is towering yet does not take pride—
Words cannot be heard,
Actions cannot be seen,
The heart vast as the sea,
The will boundless as the sky,
Abandoning artifices to establish the **Dao/Way**,
Diminishing superficial virtues to nurture true nature.

Silent and boundless, none can fathom,
Luminous yet unseen, none can discern its essence,
Crumbled yet enduring, alone it stands,
Thin without, thick within,
Humble in self, lowly in name,
Abandoning the crowd, departing from convention,
Taking the **Dao/Way** as constant.

Clad in coarse robes yet cradling jade within.
Knowing yet feigning ignorance—this is the chapter.

The unknown does not know—this is the Way of returning to the boundless.
The known knows not—this is the sickness of mistaking ignorance for wisdom.

Only the sickly cling to cleverness and profit,
Thus they are not plagued by harm nor enslaved by the crowd.

The Sage does not fret over non-existence,
For fretting over the **Dao/Way**’s unknown is the sickness itself—
Thus they are not troubled by calamity nor ensnared by comparison.

**Chapter on Returning:**
The teaching of **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** is naturalness itself.
The verification of naturalness is resonance—
All things have form and sound,
Taking and discarding echo with resonance—
Not only the myriad creatures.

When form moves, it does not generate form but generates shadow;
When sound moves, it does not generate sound but generates echo.
The non-existent generates the existent without itself existing,
The covering generates reversal without itself being covered.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** governs through *wuwei* (non-action),
Yet the knowing are vexed by excessive affairs.
The infant thrives through ignorance,
The aged decline through overreaching.

From this, it is seen:
Folly is the shape of clever wisdom,
Clever wisdom is the shadow of folly.
*Wuwei* is the original sound of spontaneous action;
Spontaneous action is the echo of *wuwei*.
Clever wisdom is the net of chaos,
Action is the rope of ruin.

Folly, through *wuwei*, is like form and sound—
The root, thus able to generate clever wisdom.
Action, like shadow and echo—
The branch, thus bringing disorder and ruin.

Hence, the myriad things cannot be harmonized,
Heaven and Earth cannot be conformed to.
Harmonizing leads to the loss of harmony,
Conforming leads to the loss of conformity.
Only by not harmonizing can harmony be achieved,
Only by not conforming can conformity be attained.

Speaking of clever wisdom’s use,
Chasing traces spawns waves—
The principles of harmony and conformity
Are extinguished with time.

Thus, action is not permissible,
Non-action is permissible.
Hence, the secure do not know danger,
The chaotic do not know governance.

Like shadows following forms, there is no escape;
Seeking shadows without movement yields nothing.
Thus, knowing yet severing knowledge—
Not constrained by knowing.
Self-destruction is its nature,
Thus it is not constrained.

Not using knowing to know—
Also not constrained by knowing.
Though its use is lost,
It does not know knowing as use—
Thus both are unconstrained.

Their unconstrained ways differ,
Yet in not being constrained, they are one.
Both do not use knowing—thus one.

Yet severing knowledge is for oneself,
Using knowledge is for others—
Thus they differ.

Therefore, the Sage cultivates the nature of openness,
Roams in the realm of profound silence,
Dwells in the land of incapacity,
Entrusts the body of non-knowing—
Silent as empty space,
Fleeting as death,
The heart scheming for nothing,
The will governing nothing,
Yet clarity and insight move,
Illuminating the four seas,
Dulling the people’s ears and eyes,
Showing them emptiness—
Kitchens unformed, sounds and colors not aroused,
Knowledge does not arise, calamities cease.

Without speech, the world is governed;
Without action, the world is transformed.
The people bow without rebellion,
Look up without imitation,
Sincere and upright, each guards their true nature—
Dazed and vast, all fulfill their natural end.

The dead have no posthumous names,
The living have no titles—
Thus they succeed endlessly, numberless as the sands of time.

Through knowing ignorance, such benefits arise—
Thus called the highest.

The next level:
Emotion finds no delight,
Nature no joy,
The heart no ease,
The will no gain—
Hating ignorance of filial piety,
Sickened by ignorance of fraternal duty,
Neither dimming **virtue/power** nor recognizing righteousness,
No rites or ceremonies,
Guarding their innate purity—
Like deer or wild geese,
Neither in sorrow nor in chaos,
As blind, as deaf—
No palaces for rulers,
No cities for the people,
No laws for the land,
No shame in the world.

Through deficient knowing,
They perform actions like sickness.

Thus it is said:
The known knows not—this is the sickness of mistaking ignorance for wisdom.

The sickly are not sick,
Entrusting themselves to the **Dao/Way**,
Neither speaking nor acting,
Yet **virtue/power** and awe arise naturally.

Heaven and Earth in harmony,
Mingled and vast,
Like turbid waters settling,
Like a dignified guest arriving—
All creatures return to simplicity,
Vanishing into stillness,
Moving without dismemberment,
Resting without fracture—
Rulers and people flourish together,
The world in quietude,
Perishing in trivial gains,
Yet enjoying great blessings.

Silent governance—
Plans cannot be plotted,
Measurements cannot be taken.
The Sage always seems sickly,
Thus not sick—
Able to align with the **Dao/Way**,
Beyond calculation or measure.

If differing from this,
Knowledge arises and deceit takes form.

How to demonstrate this?
When **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** decay,
Purity vanishes,
Strange things proliferate,
Knowledge spreads,
Rites and norms emerge,
Rankings and measures are clear—
The myriad things have order,
A hundred affairs have codes.
Borders are drawn, cities built,
States divided into districts and villages.
Nations have loyal ministers,
Families have filial children,
Inner records, outer omissions,
Paired bodies as companions,
Taking from one to give to another,
Striving for mutual enrichment—
The strong grow mighty, the weak perish.
Sacrifices to Heaven, Earth, great mountains and rivers,
Enfeoffments at Tai Mountain,
Pilgrimages to Liangfu—
Gradual traditions, some true, some false.
Thousands of lawsuits decided,
Branded criminals fill the roads,
Subjects kill their rulers,
Sons kill their fathers,
Nations fall, families break—
Numberless.
The world reaps the benefits of knowledge,
Yet suffers the guilt of death.

The knowing of ignorance,
Yet forcing knowledge upon ignorance—
This is the true knowing.

From this, it is clear:
Severing knowledge is blessing,
Loving knowledge is ruin.

Thus, even a **virtue/power**-filled ruler,
Changing resolve and heart,
Generating myriad affairs to teach the people,
Praying and sacrificing for great governance—
Naturalness will not comply.

If a **virtue/power**-filled ruler temporarily abandons the **Dao/Way** and indulges desire,
Then blessing does not become blessing—
This is the nature of rites.

If a fallen ruler discards cleverness and desire,
Severs all to halt affairs,
Cultivates the **Dao/Way** and practices **virtue/power**,
Abandons heart and intent, even seeking death—
Their form will not obey.

Now the fallen ruler temporarily turns his heart toward the **Dao/Way**,
Then ruin does not become ruin—
Thus, the form does not obey.

Therefore, the rush and retreat, the abandoning and taking up,
Are the **Dao/Way** of the Sage-King’s form and sound.

Life and death, prosperity and ruin,
Are the echoes of rush and retreat.

The Sage, thus, can move in harmony with Heaven,
And rest in unity with the **Dao/Way**,
Preserving his body while governing the realm,
Soaring beyond all doing,
At ease within the void of affairs,
Drawing blessing from the subtlest threads,
And spreading it beyond the four seas.

The Sage embodies the knowing of ignorance,
Though it seems like sickness, yet he does all things,
Never missing the slightest hint—
Thus, he blocks the ruin of petty doing,
And fulfills the greatness of non-doing.
Hence, it is said: *Take blessing from the subtlest threads,*
And spread it beyond the four seas.

Plug the eyes of the sighted,
Seal the mouths of the knowing,
Stop the ears of the hearing,
Sever the hands of the clever—
Follow the rhythms of time,
Bow and rise with the harmony.

Without doing, yet all is accomplished;
Without teaching, yet the people are governed.
Grace extends to fleeing beasts,
Kindness reaches flying birds—
For he discards hearing and wisdom,
Abandons doing and trusts the **Dao/Way**.

Because he treats sickness as sickness,
Thus he does not fall ill.
If he did not treat sickness as sickness,
Then he would not be correct.

Thus, following emotion and desire,
Exhausting the depths of heart and intent,
Moving to guide Heaven and Earth,
Resting to nurture all things,
Divine spirit within himself,
Unseen and unburned—
Without descending from his seat,
All nations prepare themselves.
Even if he wished not to perish,
Nature itself would not allow it.

If one turns away from the **Dao/Way** and follows desire,
Though he hopes to survive, he must fail—
For the strong and violent do not meet their end naturally;
This is the inevitable order.

Hence, it is said: *Nature itself would not allow it.*
*Allow* means *halt*.

The people do not fear great authority—
If the people do not fear authority, they easily do wrong—
Then great authority arrives, detached from its form.

Do not cling to what you possess, for it is low and weak;
Do not exhaust what you are given, for it is constrained and perilous.

Only those who do not weary of sweetness’s joy
Will not weary of enduring hardship.

Thus, the Sage says to the ruler:
*"Know yourself, but do not reveal yourself—*
*Then you are not called virtuous.*
*Love yourself, but do not exalt yourself above the people—*
*Then you take from that and seek this within yourself."*

**Key Principle:**
The essence of **Dao** and **virtue/power**,
The divine affairs of the numinous,
The great harmony of the heart,
The intent of Heaven and Earth—
No calamity is greater than ruin,
No blessing is greater than survival.
This is not only the **Dao/Way** of Heaven,
But also of all things and beings.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** of preserving life
Is nothing more urgent than nurturing the spirit;
The essence of nurturing the spirit
Is nothing greater than simplicity.

Always embodying reverence and dread,
Trembling and quaking—
Losing the spirit’s guardianship
Stems from indulgence;
Losing the spirit’s measure
Lies in self-assertion.

Thus, the highest reverence is for the **Dao/Way**,
Next for Heaven,
Then for Earth,
Then for humanity,
Then for oneself.

Prosperity and decline, fortune and ruin—
All arise from oneself.
Do not fear what is subtle,
But you must fear what is manifest.

Do not ponder small faults,
Or they will become great offenses.
Suffering great calamity and deep ruin,
Until annihilation—
Reverence and dread must begin at the origin,
Ascending to the formless and soaring.

Guard and be cautious before signs appear,
Then the **Dao/Way** shines greatly.
In action, you attain what you desire;
In stillness, you attain what is tranquil.
Blessing and fortune are profound and subtle,
Lost in boundlessness.

Guard and be cautious before signs appear,
Fear what has not yet been heard—
Hence, it is said: *Reverence and dread at the origin*
Leads to profound blessing and fortune.

Straight speech seems contrary,
Yet it is clear as if in darkness,
Vast and deep, beyond hearing.

Waiting for fate is within yourself—
What need is there of Heaven?
Greatest blessing turns to calamity,
Greatest fortune seems like misfortune.
When the world is drunk and sated,
None can perceive it.

Thus, the common folk see only what is near,
Hear only what is shallow,
And do not recognize the **Dao/Way** of the profound and mysterious.
They are blocked by the subtle and constant,
Sealed from the divine logic,
Examining the profit of a hair’s breadth,
Yet failing to see the ruin of mountains.
They indulge emotion and behavior,
Fearless and uninhibited.

Speech follows what is so,
Action follows what is good,
Using strength to take what is possible,
The heart complying with delusion—
Proud, extravagant, arrogant, and contentious,
Self-assertive and self-diminishing.

Loyalty and trust are what they love,
Yet they deceive even their parents,
Plunder Heaven and Earth,
Disrespect their sovereign,
Pursuing emotion and desire,
Thus defying the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.

Hence, they devise clever schemes and false names
To replace their true selves,
Bestow favors and spread kindness
Yet invite great ruin,
Flee blessings beyond Heaven,
Chase calamities across the seas—
Seeking **virtue/power** and blessing,
Yet cannot obtain them;
Calamity and disaster pursue,
With no escape.

Because they do not fear great authority,
Great authority arrives.
When great authority arrives,
Only then do they begin to do good.

At this point,
**Dao** and **virtue/power** cannot save,
Heaven and Earth cannot resolve—
This is not Heaven’s fault.
They delight in height and excess,
Bear great authority and rely on power,
Lacking dread and reverence,
Seeking nothing within themselves.

Thus, those who dread for their own bodies
Need not fear others;
Those who fear within themselves
Need not be controlled by others;
Those who comply with the small
Need not fear the great;
Those who warn of the near
Need not regret the distant.

If one can self-admonish and self-strengthen,
Being cautious each day,
Then ruin will not come from afar,
And blessing will be near.

Thus, one does not despise his station,
Yet resides in it with diligence;
Does not slight his position,
Yet enriches his conduct with propriety;
Does not weary of lowliness,
Yet transforms his great beginnings;
Does not tire of hardship and peril,
Yet severs what leads to it—
Finding joy in adversity as in success,
Accepting death as peacefully as longevity.
Even if he wished to linger,
He could not remain long.

Not shunning the bitterness of his station,
Though low and small, he refines it further,
Thus transforming its great essence—
If he finds sweetness in it without wearying,
Then he will not remain in it long.

How is this made clear?
Zhuangzi said:
*The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth*
*Begins and yet has an end,*
*Ends and yet returns to beginning.*

When yang-qi rests as the hidden dragon,
It can melt metal;
When yin-qi is at ease with frost,
It can freeze ice;
When wood thrives in the autumn hair’s breadth,
It can grow to a hundred fathoms;
When water delights in the trickling stream,
It can become the sea;
When birds take joy in the egg’s warmth,
They can soar high;
When beasts prepare in the womb’s embrace,
They can run far.

「Therefore, the sage’s wisdom is boundless and vast,
He can align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,
Transforming and moving with its shifts,
Piercing through the great constancy—
Yet still he accumulates **virtue/power** in depth,
Releases his mind’s intentions,
Conceals his keen insight,
Fears the unseen and the formless,
Hides his traces and vanishes his appearance,
Retreats to emptiness and returns to **玄冥** (Xuanming, the mysterious and dark),
Though his body weighs as much as Heaven and Earth, he does not exalt himself,
Though his **virtue/power** surpasses yin and yang, he does not display it.
Thus the sage knows himself yet does not reveal himself.

He entrusts himself to the humble and few,
Placing himself last among the myriad people,
His food lacks flavor, his garments lack adornment,
His actions are plain yet he dares not indulge his desires.
He cherishes himself yet does not esteem himself.

He upholds the **Dao/Way** and practices **virtue/power**,
Rising and falling with all things,
Nurturing the people as a father,
Meeting the masses like a sovereign,
His **virtue/power** ascending to Heaven,
His achievements credited to others,
The world renounces him in favor of others,
His benevolence deep and enduring—
Thus calamity cannot harm him while misfortune cannot plague him#6,
Fortune cannot escape him while **virtue/power** does not vanish.

Not the **Dao/Way** of harmony with Heaven and Earth,
Nor the **Dao/Way** of partiality toward the world—
He guards against the slightest beginnings,
Maintains loyalty and sincerity in weakness,
Follows the **Dao/Way** and aligns with Heaven,
Resonates with all things in their natural course,
Fears calamity yet finds joy in it,
Embraces ease yet endures hardship,
Success and failure, life and death—
These he seeks within himself.
Abandoning arrogance and excess,
Taking humility and meekness instead.
**Courage and daring:**
If one dares in courage, he brings slaughter, defeat, and injury;
If one dares not in courage, he achieves vitality, joy, and longevity.
These two paths teach life and death,
Sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful—
A matter of gain or loss, of fortune or woe.

What Heaven detests is easily named,
Yet who knows its reasons? None can explain.
The **Dao/Way** of Heaven is both yin and yang,
It does not contend yet naturally prevails—
Following the forms of things,
Responding without words to their sounds,
Summoning none yet all come of their own accord—
Things reveal themselves naturally.
It is plain yet masterfully strategizes—
Things disclose their own dispositions.
The Heavenly net is vast and boundless,
Fine as though nonexistent yet nothing escapes—
Wide yet nothing is lost, retaining what should not be abandoned#7.

**The principle of alignment:**
The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth,
The logic of life and death,
Has neither departure nor approach,
Neither taking nor giving,
Neither action nor inaction—
Yet all things arise naturally.
Straight as a plumb line,
Smooth as water,
Responding to circumstances and emulating patterns,
Rising with all things in harmony,
Gaining and losing, taking and discarding,
Completing tasks from beginning to end,
Deep or shallow, light or heavy—
All things take their own measure,
Diverse forms and kinds,
Each returning to its natural state#8.
Life is the root of death,
Death is the origin of life—
These two, when contrasted,
Reveal fortune and misfortune.

Thus, he who knows life yet not death
Inverts Heaven’s order;
He who knows death yet not life
Defies Earth’s principle.
Hence, joy and anger have their limits,
Life and death their measures—
Receiving Heaven’s punishment,
Enduring Earth’s retribution.
When anger is due yet not expressed,
His sons become wolves and his brothers oxen#9;
When battle is called yet not fought,
His wives become enemy states and his concubines great bandits#10;
When death is decreed yet not carried out,
He invites Heaven’s wrath and is dominated by things;
When joy is owed yet not given,
He suffers Heaven’s disaster and meets Earth’s blame;
When life is granted yet not nurtured,
Rulers lose their kingdoms and commoners their lives.
Thus the noble man kills his people as he would his own body,
Gives life to others as he would to himself,
Holding fast to **virtue/power** and uprightness,
Acting only when necessity compels him.

To preserve life and ensure the nation’s peace,
Lies in the balance of life and death—
If life and death are governed rightly,
Heaven and Earth will protect him,
And the measure of joy and anger
Will bring all things to him.
Hence, he is firm yet resolute,
Strikes deep and with severity,
Repels evil and nourishes the good,
Dares yet knows restraint.

Skilled in defense and war,
Clear in opening and closing,
Long in resentment yet swift in retribution,
At ease in stillness yet joyful in action,
Benefiting the nation and the people,
Not avoiding the strong or mighty,
His威令 (威令, awe and authority) shakes the hundred barbarians,
His influence sways the borders beyond—
He attains half of what is good.
This is from daring in courage.

The meek and weak, fearing and respecting,
Dreading to harm others with words,
Reflecting deeply to grasp far-reaching thoughts,
Confronting justice yet punishing grudges,
Pursuing longevity and few conflicts,
Accumulating benevolence through broad and profound deeds.
He benefits without harming,
To make his goodness known;
He gives without taking,
To manifest his name;
He rewards without punishing,
To establish his grace;
He grants life without killing,
To fulfill his仁 (ren, compassion)—
He attains half of what is good.
This is from daring not to dare.

In all these two achievements—
Daring in courage and daring not to dare—
Their strategies diverge yet both strike the mark,
Their paths contradict yet both find their purpose—
One may turn a thousand chariots into captives,
Another may transform an ordinary man into a sovereign.
Thus, things may be nurtured for fortune or for calamity,
Or slain for fortune or for ruin.
These two principles are profound and subtle,
None can fully fathom them.
Unable to grasp them fully,
They do not perceive the mysterious and dark’s disposition,
Nor distinguish the divisions of calamity and fortune.
Only those who attain the **Dao/Way** comprehend the unseen before it occurs,
And can thus govern its beginnings—
Beyond the reach of ordinary measures.
Hence it is said that these two principles are profound and subtle,
None can fully explore them.

Thus, nurturing what Heaven detests,
Harms what Heaven protects;
Nurturing what Heaven protects,
Harms what Heaven detests.
One reversal, one inversion,
May yield **玄德** (Xuanming, mysterious virtue);
One inversion, one reversal,
May breed **玄贼** (Xuanming, mysterious ruin).
Serve Heaven and Earth as a father,
And your descendants will prosper.
Thus, if you nurture yet the future declines,
Life was meant to perish;
If you slay yet fortune arrives,
Death was meant to live;
If you slaughter yet blessings follow,
Killing was meant to bring fortune;
If you destroy yet misfortune comes,
Killing was meant to nurture life.
What Heaven detests, do not dare to preserve;
What Heaven protects, do not dare to slay;
What Heaven diminishes, do not dare to give;
What Heaven benefits, do not dare to take.
To give or not to give,
Only Heaven decides;
To slay or not to slay,
No mortal knows.
Thus, daring in courage often leads to harm and defeat,
Daring not to dare aligns with Heaven’s decree.»

「Thus, the daring that does not dare aligns with Heaven’s decree—
in action, it harmonizes with the **Dao** of Heaven,
in stillness, it reaches the **extreme** of Earth.
What Heaven’s heart detests, none can justify.
Who knows the reason for Heaven’s displeasure?

The **Dao** of Heaven and Earth:
one **yin** and one **yang**,
divides into the four seasons,
separates into the five **phases**,
flows into the ten thousand things,
refines into the three luminaries.
**Yang qi** governs **virtue/power**,
**yin qi** governs punishment,
encompassing all beings,
breathing life to distant lands,
mysterious and impartial,
upright and just.

It does not favor life for cleverness,
nor punish killing for skillfulness,
responding to all things,
never acting alone—
auspiciousness with auspiciousness,
calamity with calamity,
harming those who do evil,
rewarding those who do good.
Thus, without action, things arise;
without action, things perish.
Shadows mingle, echoes resonate—
without seeking, things are obtained;
without constraint, things conform;
without scrutiny, things reveal themselves;
without inquiry, things express their nature.
This is the **Dao** of Heaven.

Hence, without strife, one conquers all;
without words, one responds to all;
without summoning, all come.
Silent and vast,
planning all without effort—
this is called conquering without strife,
responding without words,
summoning without call,
and planning without speech.

The **Dao** is woven in **惚恍** (huǎnghuǎng, indistinct yet discernible),
yet its net is formless—
sprawling yet boundless,
far-reaching yet lingering,
penetrating without gaps,
adapting to all things.
Thus, it precedes yet never strays far,
follows yet never arrives late,
acts in stillness yet is inaudible,
advances and retreats unseen.
From beginning to end, fortune and misfortune,
auspiciousness and calamity,
all return as they ought—
none can escape beyond Heaven’s reach.
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
though sparse, it never misses.

The people do not fear death—
they regard their lives lightly.
How can fear of death restrain them?
If the people were made to always fear death,
they would find peace.
But those who act strangely become blessings for others—
I could seize and execute them,
punish their deceitful excesses,
and impose stern laws with trustworthy punishments.
Yet who would dare?

There are always those who execute punishment—
*[referring to]* the great ministers.
And those who substitute for them—
*[referring to]* the sovereign.
This is improper—
the sovereign should not replace the great ministers in judgment.
If the sovereign were to replace the great carpenter in cutting,
his hands would soon be injured.
*[Annotation: "指归" (zhǐguī) here may imply a moral or practical conclusion.]*

Human nature and disposition:
the ignorant are faithful and trustworthy,
the knowing are shameless and deceitful;
content when fortunate,
scheming when misfortune strikes;
despising death in poverty,
cherishing life in ease.»

「How does one understand this? Zhuangzi says: The infant is faithful and trustworthy toward its enemies and rivals when it knows nothing, but when it grows strong and gains knowledge, it deceives even its elder brothers and sisters-in-law.

When the three armies are in high spirits, they abandon even captured soldiers; beasts in the narrow valleys do not flee from rhinoceroses or tigers. This is not because their nature has changed—it is simply the way of things.

From this, we see: if the people’s hearts are not won, their lives and fates are incomplete, then decrees and commands cannot move them. If they are wretched and distressed, they do not fear death lightly, then punishments and penalties cannot terrify them.

Thus, rulers who delight in knowledge, burdened by worldly cares and the people’s labor, sacrifice to heaven and earth, ward off calamities and dispel misfortunes, summon goodness and invite blessings, pray to spirits and deities, and manipulate all affairs—ever shifting to please the people—will find that households know kindness, streets abound with virtuous and wise men.

But if they defy the natural order, rely solely on human hearts, take their own opinions as wisdom, and their own arguments as just—if they abandon proper distinctions, disregard the principles of things, and obstruct the Dao while fostering false praise—then the world will be thrown into great chaos, the common folk will be restless and anxious, labor will be unending, and poverty will breed deceit.

Those who dare to defy will be honored and rewarded, the lighthearted will thrive in ease, the virtuous will suffer in want, those who fear the law will starve in distress, the weak will grow bitter and long for death, while the powerful will revel in their dominion over the king.

Thus, when the world rushes toward fame and contests for influence, without regard for right or wrong, splitting hairs and parsing minutiae, and treats death as a return home—then, if stern laws and harsh punishments are imposed, it is like restraining what is easy and controlling what is light. When it comes to this, people no longer fear death—how can one frighten them with it? Such words are senseless.

Hence, executions and punishments multiply, yet deceit does not cease; rewards and stipends are given, yet the great ministers do not obey; the common people do not rally, and the feudal lords do not submit. The land is not truly his, nor is the people’s loyalty. Therefore, the sage-ruler guides the people thus: the sovereign does nothing, yet the people have no grievances; the people gain nothing, yet the sovereign loses nothing.

His achievements are easily won yet hard to lose; his transformations are difficult to resist yet easy to enact; his garments are easily made yet hard to wear out; his food is easily sufficient yet hard to exhaust. Thus, those who crave life and abhor death, who shun excess and despise ruin, all hold their spirits dear and cherish their bodies, so that form can be controlled and influence can be restrained.

People fear death and value life—this is their natural state. Hence, even the bold and the wise, those who are open and far-reaching, do not dare to create blessings or wield authority. Thus, laws are established yet unused, rewards are set yet not bestowed.

Why is this so? Because the sovereign’s weight is as great as heaven and earth, while all other things are as light as feathers. If laws are stern and punishments severe, the wise know not to transgress. Those who alone do not fear, when their crimes are exposed, will be put to death by the officials—who would dare to defy?

Therefore, the Dao of the Emperor-King is to act without interference, to see without gazing, to hear without listening, to scheme without plotting, and to speak without uttering words. Before, behind, left, and right—each has its appointed duty. He relies on their responses to oversee, ensures their success, grants them their aspirations, and accepts their deeds. Titles are bestowed upon worthy lords, stipends given to advancing virtuous men. Those who create blessings will die, those who usurp authority will see their clans destroyed, and all officials will hasten to their duties—leaving the sovereign uninvolved.

Each has its proper role, none may overstep or substitute. When entrusted with what they are capable of, the Great Dao is achieved, all affairs become clear, and the realm stands still in perfect order, conquering all without effort.

If ministers act as sovereigns, they will lose their own lives; if sovereigns act as ministers, they will surely harm their states.

2. *"所"* ["that which"] was originally omitted, added according to the *Secret Edition*.
3. *"常处"* ["constant abode"] was originally *"堂处"* ["hall abode"], corrected according to the *Secret Edition*.

The sovereign’s Dao lies in the unseen, the minister’s in the seen. The sovereign alone holds absolute authority, the ministers alone establish proper names. When the sovereign and ministers are separated, all affairs become clear.

The division between ruler and subject must never be blurred. Thus, when the sovereign’s position is fixed and the ministers’ duties are clear, all affairs become manifest. The sovereign has his allotted sphere, the ministers their appointed tasks. To discern their proper roles and duties is to ensure none may substitute for another. Each guards his own circle, the Great Dao is then achieved, all affairs become clear, and the realm stands still in perfect order, conquering all without effort.

If ministers act as sovereigns, they will lose their own lives; if sovereigns act as ministers, they will surely harm their states.

**Chapter on Human Hunger**
When humans hunger, they are never fully sated—
the sovereign’s excessive taxation is deemed a delight,
thus the people suffer from meager provisions.

The common folk are hard to govern, banditry arises—
because the sovereign’s actions are for himself alone,
the state thus falls into disorder and turmoil.

The people’s disregard for death is not of their own making—
their insatiable craving for life knows no bounds,
thus they lightly risk death and easily incur blame.

To not value life as equal to death is to be wiser than those who prize life’s ease and enduring comfort.

**Annotations:**
The Dao/Way’s bestowal upon humans has its measure,
the Heaven and Earth’s sustenance of humans has its measure,
the kings and nobles’ governance of the state has its measure,
the ministers’ fulfillment of their duties has its measure,
and all creatures’ preservation of their own lives has its measure.

Humans inherit life and are shaped by nature—
their hearts and minds are enlightened,
yet they gain life by their own accord.
The organs and viscera pass down in sequence,
*qi* and blood circulate in harmony,
surface and depth respond in unison,
high and low fulfill their roles,
flexion and extension move with ease,
sight and hearing are sharp and clear—
this is how the Dao/Way allots its measure to humans.

Heaven and Earth embrace and nurture—
clouds drift, rain falls,
thunder and wind act in concert,
the sun and moon alternate their courses,
spring blooms, summer flourishes,
autumn harvests, winter stores,
*yīn-yáng* (阴阳) in perfect accord,
all things thrive in abundance,
and humans act in ways that sustain life—
this is how Heaven and Earth allot their measure to humans.

Following the Dao/Way to cultivate *virtue/power*,
conforming to Heaven’s natural order,
exerting one’s utmost effort without ceasing,
embracing sincerity and practicing simplicity,
returning to the boundless *Wu Jí* (无极),
refining desires and paring excess,
setting an example for all under Heaven,
each upholding their proper name,
all perfecting their *virtue/power*,
enjoying life and securing the people,
the Four Seas in submission—
this is how kings and nobles safeguard their rule.

Great harmony and rectitude prevail,
uprightness without deviation,
loyalty and sincerity in obedience,
fulfilling their appointed duties,
approving the good and condemning the evil,
never altering truth for name,
not slighting their rank,
not demeaning their attire—
this is how ministers preserve their integrity.

With humble hearts and earnest simplicity,
practicing moderation and fortifying resolve,
conforming to Heaven’s seasons,
exhausting Earth’s resources,
wearing clothes suited to their form,
eating to harmonize their stomachs,
laboring at dawn and resting at dusk,
not despising their dwelling,
not wearying of their food—
this is how the common folk preserve their lives.

When movement and stillness lose harmony, they lose the Dao/Way’s measure;
When plowing and harvesting fall out of season, they lose Heaven’s measure;
When they abandon duty and follow their own will, they lose the sovereign’s measure;
When they fabricate and deceive, they lose the ministers’ measure;
When their clothing and food are ill-suited, they lose the people’s measure.

To lose the Dao/Way’s measure is to corrupt one’s nature;
To lose Heaven’s measure is to bring ruin to one’s family;
To lose the sovereign’s measure is to imperil the state;
To lose the ministers’ measure is to endanger one’s life;
To lose the people’s measure is to forfeit one’s existence.

The Dao/Way, Heaven and Earth, sovereign and ministers, officials and commoners—
their actions in motion and stillness each have their proper measure.
To uphold their measure is to ensure both high and low flourish;
To abandon their proper roles is to bring hardship to all.

To guard one’s measure as it should be is to align with Heaven and Earth,
to diminish oneself and spare excess is to walk with the Dao/Way.
If sacrifices are never ceased,
future generations will prosper.

To overstep one’s measure and seek excess
brings ill fortune upon oneself,
burdens that accumulate,
and calamity for future generations.

This is why ancient sages abandoned their bodies,
enduring hunger, cold, hardship, and poverty—
because their actions in motion and stillness were unharmonious,
their plowing and harvesting fell out of season,
they indulged their emotions and followed their desires,
their cravings for pleasure knew no limit,
they exhausted the five flavors in food,
adorned themselves with elaborate patterns,
pursued extravagance and licentiousness,
ignored the awe of Heaven,
amassed great labor and virtue,
yet could not restrain their excess.
Their consumption of food and clothing
was double that of ordinary people.

Thus, the people’s hunger stems
from the sovereign’s heavy taxation
and his failure to uphold his proper measure,
while they emulate his extravagance and waste.

Hence, the poor suffer in body,
their misfortunes extend to their descendants,
so rags are worn thin yet never discarded,
simple fare is lacking yet never spurned,
and the common folk secretly hoard gains while indulging in vice,
publicly neglecting duty while pursuing private interests.

Those who enrich their families grow wealthy,
those who scheme for the state grow poor,
the upright die first,
the honest suffer hardship and poverty,
customs decay and morals falter,
what is false prevails over truth,
chaos and disorder thrive,
virtuous men retreat in seclusion,
the weak and few are oppressed,
the strong and powerful dominate,
the poor become slaves,
the rich act like kings.

For they indulge in licentious rule and chaotic governance,
do not heed the natural order,
defy their own nature and yield to desire,
abandon the Dao/Way and stray from Heaven,
adorn false knowledge and fabricate schemes,
all to gratify their own hearts.

The people are hard to transform
because the sovereign acts unnaturally.

Thus, simplicity fades and purity vanishes,
crafty schemes multiply,
novelties abound daily,
beyond count or form,
flatterers are favored,
deceitful men are ennobled,
ministerial stratagems triumph,
the sovereign’s true Dao/Way is stifled,
paths of deceit and oppression are embellished,
dangers of annihilation and peril arise,
loyal and upright men are sidelined and grow ever distant,
while cunning deceivers gather in crowds and soar together.

The wicked do not die,
the corrupt are not punished,
power is established, influence prevails,
their authority shakes the armies—
whatever they gaze upon,
whatever they will,
comes swiftly to their command,
all for their own preservation,
yet they all exceed the bounds of the world,
some like this, some like that,
confused and discontented.

It is better to perish than to persist,
better to die than to live—
with bold resolve and reckless daring,
glowering eyes fixed upon one another,
sovereign and ministers conspire,
fathers and sons plot in secret,
boiling cauldrons cannot deter them,
sharp blades cannot stop them.

The people thus risk their lives for trifling gains,
seize opportunities in perilous straits,
defy heavy prohibitions,
charge into deadly blades,
brave flying arrows,
never heeding their own safety—
all for the sake of fleeting honor and excessive craving for life.»

The saying that people lightly risk death is because they crave life excessively. Thus, when they lose wealth or rank, some suffer gut-wrenching sorrow, drive themselves mad, hang themselves, waste their vital essence, abandon their spirit—constantly yearning for death, seizing blades to harm themselves, or plunging into deep waters. Hence, they hold death lightly.

Thus, the Way of Nature ever opposes things. The formless lives, the formed dies; those who pursue gain encounter calamity, those who seek fortune meet disaster. They come unsummoned, meet without invitation—I though I would avoid them, yet the world cannot escape. Therefore, the relentless pursuit of life and gain is the root of death, while abandoning form and rejecting gain is the root of life.

The nameless and lowly suffer no misfortune;
the humble and disgraced incur no blame;
coarse food and simple broth breed lasting contentment;
rough cloth and deer-hide garments bring enduring comfort;
when one does not burden the people, peace and ease endure;
when one does not cling to life, longevity follows.
This is the way to transcend life.

Thus, one who can abandon all selfish divisions, stripping away all desires, lies motionless like a corpse, stands unchanging like a wooden post—neither altered by transformation, nor distinguished by life and death, neither exalted as a sovereign, nor debased as a slave. Only in what one encounters, yielding to the unfolding of Nature, does one neither fear annihilation nor rejoice in life. Then one aligns with the Dao as a person, befriends Heaven and Earth, attains longevity and clear vision, cycles endlessly, and transcends all bounds of wealth and nobility—becoming the marketplace of the world. This surpasses the mere valuing of life.

**On the Nature of Life and Death**
Human life is soft and weak, for spirit resides in the body; death is rigid and strong, for spirit departs the body.
Grass and trees in life are soft and pliable, for yang-qi abides within; in death, they wither and decay, for yang-qi withdraws.

Thus, rigidity and strength are the form of death’s followers,
while softness and weakness are the bearing of life’s survivors.
A strong army cannot overcome its fourfold reversals;
a rigid tree cannot thrive among its kin.
Strength and grandeur bring ruin—this is the exhaustion of the Way;
smallness and weakness bring harmony—this is attaining the mean.

**The Pivot of Return:**
With all things it arises together, yet has no form or sound;
it lacks color or taste, nor does it reek or perfume.
It enters and exits without doors, comes and goes without gates—
above, it has no stalk; below, no root.
Serene and still, it never alters, preserving its constancy.
Harmonious and subtle, its transformations know no bounds.
It blends with all things, yet gives birth to the Three—
the origin of Heaven and Earth, the ancestral source of yin and yang.
When things exist, it abides; when things perish, it departs.
Unnameable, it is called *Shenming* [Divine Clarity].

Born of the Great Void, it thrives in the formless,
receiving without decay, bestowing without depletion.
In motion, it knows no end; in stillness, it is boundless.
It encompasses all without limit, penetrates all without exclusion—
flowing beyond all things, traversing all that exists.
Heaven gallops, Earth races, yet cannot overtake it;
yin strains, yang flees, yet cannot outstrip it.
Echoes exhaust themselves yet cannot respond;
shadows dissolve yet cannot resemble it.
Take from it, yet it is never spent;
give to it, yet it is never depleted.
It has no partiality in giving or taking,
no hatred or love—
it retains softness, dwells in weakness,
returning to emptiness.
Advancing and retreating, bending and stretching,
it ever aligns with *virtue/power*,
leading the Dao, while things grow distant.
Those who receive much are sage and wise;
those who receive little are foolish and dull.

Thus, the Divine Clarity and sage wisdom are the eternal masters of life;
softness, weakness, and stillness are the dwelling of Divine Clarity.
When spirit resides in the body, life is soft and weak—
this is the abode of Divine Clarity.

When Divine Clarity dwells in a person,
it cannot be removed if in its right place,
nor can it be retained if lost.
Neither coercive power nor clever schemes can control it.
If one can nurture it, wealth and nobility never fade,
and one remains forever in high station, growing ever more secure.

Thus, at birth, bones are weak, sinews supple,
blood and qi flow freely,
the mind is focused, spirit harmonious,
the face radiant, the body luminous,
movements graceful, every joint firm—
day by day, vitality increases, and within months, clarity sharpens.
Why? Because spirit resides within.

But as one ages, bones wither, sinews tighten,
hair turns white, flesh atrophies,
food and drink lose flavor,
hearing and sight dull,
strength and vigor wane daily,
movements decline monthly,
thought grows muddled, choices conflict.
At death, the body shrinks, the face hollows, the tongue retreats, the limbs stretch.
Why? Because spirit has departed.
This is the rigidity of death.

When grass and trees first sprout, branches are supple, leaves lush and green,
abundant and beautiful, soft and harmonious—
for yang-qi abides within.
As they decline, leaves yellow and wither, colors fade and perish.
At death, roots and stems wither, branches grow rigid and hard—
for yang-qi has departed.
Thus, grass and trees in life are soft and pliable, in death, withered and brittle.

Where Divine Clarity resides, the perilous may be secured, the dead revived;
where it departs, the safe may perish, the strong may be slain.
Where yang-qi abides, trees may bend and grass may bind;
where it flees, breath may congeal and ice may shatter.

Thus, Divine Clarity and yang-qi are the root of life,
while softness and weakness are the medicine for all things.
Harmony and yielding are the means of longevity,
the refuge of Divine Clarity and yang-qi.

All things follow yang in their yielding softness—
thus, rigidity and fullness are the likeness of death;
softness and smoothness are the dwelling of life.
The rigid and strong are death’s followers;
the soft and weak are life’s survivors.

In human nature, one hates a neighbor’s father for his strength,
loves a neighbor’s child for his weakness;
burns withered branches for their hardness,
adorns with jade and ornaments for their smoothness.
People love the young and hate the old—
for life’s vitality lies in their measure.

Thus, when there is no sovereign above, the feudal lords encroach upon one another,
contending states vie for power, armies are raised and poised to confront—
the soft and weak prevail, the rigid and strong are exhausted.

Why is this so?
The armies of the strong are not aligned with the Dao of Heaven and Earth;
their foundation is not in harmony and yielding, nor in virtue of compassion and love.
They punish the arrogant and violent, rescue the insufficient,
and break the greedy and the usurping.

The generals rely on the might of their state and the multitude of their people,
seeking glory and fame, mimicking the ways of others,
thus they covet others’ lands and wealth,
take joy in slaughter and injury,
ravage ancestral temples and shrines,
and bring ruin to the people—
all to display their overwhelming power.

Submissive and fearful below, they exploit others’ advantages to assert their own will,
those who draw near meet ruin, those who serve meet disaster,
their blame and cruelty run counter to human nature,
their slaughter defies the will of Heaven.

In life, they bring suffering to the world;
in death, they benefit the world.
The many, though weak, unite as one,
sharing sorrow and plotting together—
though they bear the name of strength,
in truth, they cannot prevail.

This is what is meant by *"strong armies do not conquer."*
Why is this so?
For they are bound by poisonous knots—
Heaven’s Dao does not favor them.

How can this be made clear?
In ancient times, mighty Qin and Chu
annihilated the feudal lords,
united the domains and cities,
grew rich in their states,
and became sovereigns, their power swaying the world,
their might trembling across the seas,
their honors and privileges reaching their peak—
they could be called strong indeed.

Yet, when they sat at ease, the feudal lords were in distress;
when they stretched their feet, the world trembled in fear;
when they issued commands, Heaven’s heart grieved;
when they took action, the Divine Clarity was disturbed—
their nations fell, their families were ruined,
and their own lives were cut short.

Why was this so?
Because they abandoned softness and weakness for rigidity and strength.

When the divine Han was about to rise,
they fled like dragons into hiding,
yet the people sought them out—
and they could not escape.

Father Heaven, Mother Earth,
loving the people as their own children,
rewarding merit and nurturing virtue,
teaching those who follow the Dao,
responding to enemies and adapting to change,
their strategies vast as rivers and seas—
they conquered Qin and extinguished Chu,
the world rejoiced in harmony,
and they were established as sovereigns.

Why was this so?
Because they acted with compassion and humility,
in accordance with Heaven’s will.

This is not only true of human affairs—
it applies to all things.

Great trees, towering a hundred *rèn* high,
with massive trunks and branches,
their heads split through the central gate,
their roots divided by the doorframe—
though they bear no fruit,
they endure at the lowest level.

Yet countless smaller trees,
stretching their limbs and leaves,
lush and verdant,
thrive above them—
for their forms are great yet their strength is weak.
This is what is meant by *"strong trees are shared."*

Thus, the Dao of Divine Clarity,
the principle of Heaven and Earth,
does not uphold the small to bear the great,
nor the light to bear the heavy.

Hence, the strong cannot rule as kings,
nor can the mighty trees dwell above.
The strong and mighty reside below;
the weak and small dwell above—
this is the natural order of things.
When the weak and small dwell above,
it is the fixed law of Heaven.

The **Chapter of Heaven’s Dao**:
Heaven’s Dao is both yin and yang,
like a drawn bow with its tension and release.
The high are lowered to grow long and strong,
the low are raised to begin their life.
Those with excess are diminished to break fullness,
those lacking are supplemented to fill emptiness.
Heaven’s Dao:
to diminish excess and balance is constant,
to supplement deficiency and provide support is to court ruin.

Human affairs are not so—
they cannot be thus practiced.
They diminish the deficient, plunder the weak,
and hoard the excess for the mighty.
Who can diminish the excess with clear insight,
and bestow the world’s blessings to all,
thus ensuring life and harmony together?
Only the one who follows the Dao is nameless.

Thus, the Sage says of the enlightened king:
*"He acts but does not rely on force,
he achieves success but does not dwell upon it,
he does not seek fame nor fear great calamity.
He points the way—*

Before Heaven and Earth began,
yin and yang had not yet emerged,
cold and heat had not yet appeared,
light and darkness had not yet formed—
there stood a primordial entity,
one turbid, one pure,
the pure above, the turbid below,
harmony in the center.
When these three arose together,
Heaven and Earth were complete,
yin and yang intermingled,
and all things were born.

Those who lose it perish,
those who grasp it flourish.
In things, harmony is:
rigid yet never broken,
soft yet never obstructed.
In Heaven, it is the measure;
on Earth, it is the standard.
In yang, it is the compass;
in yin, it is the square.
It does not move without restraint,
nor does it rest without purpose.
Things rely on softness and weakness,
while qi depends on firmness and strength—
in motion, it controls all,
in stillness, it accommodates all.

Thus, harmony is:
the application of virtue and power,
the support of Divine Clarity,
the mechanism of Heaven and Earth,
the dwelling of all living things,
the essential principle of the ten thousand directions,
the repository of nature,
the gateway of all blessings,
the door to universal fortune.

Hence, the wise see it as wisdom,
the virtuous see it as virtue—
the world clings to it day and night,
yet none can fully comprehend it.

Why is this so?
Because its power in nurturing things is subtle,
and its achievement of affairs is profound.

Thus, Heaven and Earth’s Dao:
does no harm nor injury,
its action is non-action—
it guards with great harmony and rectitude,
adapting to things with depth and sincerity,
upholding nothing in vain,
claiming nothing for itself—
each thing fulfills its nature,
and all things return to their natural state.

Hence, the flourishing self-destruct,
the stretched self-loosen,
the hidden self-reveal,
the obscure self-illuminate,
the deficient gain support,
the excessive are diminished—
those who exist will perish,
those who live will die,
right and wrong invert themselves,
fortune and misfortune are self-taken—
diminishment cannot be avoided,
gain cannot be resisted—
calamity does not linger constantly,
fortune does not remain forever—
each receives its due share,
and none can possess both.

Thus, the scaly have no fur,
the furred have no feathers,
the winged have no teeth,
the horned have no claws—
those seen in the day vanish at night,
those gained in the past are lost in the future,
double benefits are rare,
and never experienced before.

Affairs do not flourish in parallel,
benefits do not come in pairs.
Not too great, nor too small—
fixed in unity, unchanging—
once they reach their fullness,
they cannot be resolved.

「Thus, the sun reaches its zenith and then declines,
the moon waxes full and then wanes,
the seasons shift in their ceaseless change—
one wanes as the other waxes.

Beneath towering peaks, deep valleys must lie;
where great springs flow, fierce waves arise.
Molten gold and stone harden in frozen ice,
the earth’s fissures are shaped by yin and yang—
this is the Dao/Way of Heaven:
when yin reaches its extreme, yang ascends,
when yang reaches its extreme, yin descends.

All craftsmen follow this principle without fail.

Now, the archer’s craft:
when the bow is strung, it both contracts and expands,
when drawn, it both tightens and releases—
its shape is measured by compass and square,
its tension guided by the plumb line.
If the string is too high and taut, it is slackened;
if too low and loose, it is pulled upward.
Excess is trimmed, deficiency is supplemented;
the string’s balance is entrusted to its quality,
the bow’s harmony to its draw—
thus, when struck, the bow sends the arrow true.

Heaven’s Dao/Way is the same:
hence it is said, *"It is like drawing a bow."*

To elevate the low and suppress the high—
this is the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth.
To act against Heaven’s will to please the people,
to act against the people’s will to follow the Dao/Way—
the virtuous serve as assistants,
the sage rules as master.
He strives to love with abundance,
to govern as both left and right hand.
The wise occupy high positions,
the foolish occupy low ones.
Great merit earns high rank,
minor talents earn low office.
Outstanding deeds receive meager rewards,
exhaustive labor yields heavy stipends—
this is the Dao/Way of the feudal lords.

Thus, the conduct of humanity.

To deceive the sincere and loyal,
to insult the faithful and upright,
to oppress the weak and rob the few,
to enslave the ignorant and burden the common folk,
to take from the slack and give to the taut,
to diminish the small and empower the strong,
to oppose what is obscure and favor what is manifest—
this is the Dao/Way of the many,
the so-called *"supplementing the deficient to serve the excessive."*

To dwell in the small while possessing the great,
to abide in the dim while holding the bright,
to stand firm while the weak are subdued,
to gather strength while the few are scattered,
to rise above while sinking low—
thus, the lofty cannot be cut down,
the full cannot be shattered,
the great cannot be broken,
the overflowing cannot be diminished,
the rigid cannot be bent,
the yielding cannot be blocked,
the solitary cannot be controlled,
the feeble cannot be seized,
the foolish cannot be belittled,
the empty cannot be filled—
Heaven and Earth protect them as their own children,
the people sustain them as their own mothers.
In harmony with all, they soar with the Dao/Way,
aligned with the Dao/Way, they begin and end with it—
Heaven and humanity in mutual accord,
the divine and the bright as their steadfast guardians—
this is the Dao/Way of the *至人* (perfected sage).

The perfected sage always lacks nothing for himself yet ever has abundance,
uniting with the Dao/Way to nurture all under Heaven—
thus, they are called *有道者* (those of the Dao/Way).

Therefore, the sage’s actions:
no fixed purpose, yet in perfect accord,
gentleness and weakness as their foundation,
hidden yet never exhausted,
honored yet never ostentatious—
they decline titles and reject wealth,
spare their strength and take nothing extra,
fill the land yet do not enter it,
nurture the people yet do not befriend them.
They tremble as if they had already lost something,
they vigilantly guard as if already guilty—
walking the Dao/Way in harmony,
constantly befriending all things,
mastering Heaven’s patterns,
penetrating Earth’s principles—
they achieve success yet do not claim it,
their virtue flows yet they do not hoard it.
This is the saying: *"Do and do not rely upon it; achieve success and do not claim it."*

They flee fame and evade power,
the mysterious and dark as their refuge—
they extinguish extremes and conceal traces,
the formless as their guardian—
in stillness and solitude, vast as empty space,
none can take from or give to them—
proud yet independent,
aligned with Heaven’s Dao/Way.

Why is this so?
They fear the calamities of the Dao/Way,
and dare not appear before the virtuous.

Though they possess merits that could overshadow Heaven,
they do not wish to be seen—
this is the saying: *"Not wishing to appear before the virtuous,"*
the conduct of sages and wise philosophers.

**Chapter on the Soft and Weak:**
Under Heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than water,
yet it erodes the hard and strong—
its power is like that of a whetstone or chisel.
None can precede water in its formation,
and nothing can surpass it—
this is its unparalleled nature.

Water’s victory over the strong lies in its ability to submerge all things,
the yielding overcoming the rigid yet never exhausted—
all under Heaven know its purpose clearly,
yet few can act with its scarcity and weakness.

The sage’s words say:
*"The pattern of transmitting the state"*—
to endure the state’s filth and shame,
to bear its disgrace—
this is called the ruler of the feudal lords, the *侯伯* (marquis and earl).
To endure the state’s misfortunes and calamities,
to bear its ills—
this is called the ruler of all under Heaven, the *帝王* (emperor and king).
Straight words appear as contrary,
actions seem to clash with their purpose.

To pacify great grudges and offenses,
if the ruler harms the people,
there will be even greater resentment toward the virtuous—
how can this be considered good?
Thus, the sage says of the *明君* (enlightened ruler):
they hold the left contract but do not demand it of others—
this is the Dao/Way of nature.

The virtuous govern through contracts,
seeking virtue within themselves;
the unvirtuous govern through tracks,
demanding it from others.

Heaven’s Dao/Way has no favorites—
it is just and harmonious,
its virtue always aligning with the good.

**Conclusion:**
Moral principles encompass all,
Heaven and Earth bear them,
yin and yang transform them,
the sun and moon illuminate them—
all things flourish together,
in chaotic yet ordered unity,
their rise and fall, existence and demise,
changing with the times.

The rigid accumulate and thus fail,
the yielding endure and thus prevail—
this is the natural law of all things.

Hence, water’s ability to strike stone and pierce metal,
to topple mountains and breach dikes,
to flow ceaselessly in cycles of ebb and tide,
to sink into boundlessness—
vast and endless,
far-reaching with no shore,
its clarity cannot be obscured,
its strength cannot be augmented,
though murky, it can become pure,
though few, it can multiply—
in peril, it can restore safety,
in haste, it can bring repose—
changing with the times,
it dies yet is reborn.

It permeates all things,
nurtures all forms—
it bestows without depletion,
sustains without decay—
it pours into the four seas yet claims no merit,
it matches Heaven and Earth yet does nothing extra—
within the minutest spaces, it moves with ease,
above the nine wilds, it soars without effort—
its blessings reach the azure heavens,
its depths accumulate in the yellow earth—
it strengthens to support Heaven and Earth,
it weakens to sink beneath fur and feathers,
it gathers the sparse to form rivers and seas.
High and low have no fixed order,
it begins and ends without end—
advancing, retreating, bending, stretching—
this is the nature of those near the Dao/Way,
for its form is soft and weak,
its actions and stillness await the times,
it does not set a fixed direction,
its harmony is smooth and effortless.

Thus, all craftsmen,
though their works differ in purpose and method,
rely on water’s power—
to soften gold and stone,
to break the hard and bend the rigid,
to level the low and refine the subtle,
to release the bound and ease all forms,
to blend the five flavors,
to purify foul odors,
to strike the firm and enter the great—
none can do this without water’s aid.»

The things beneath Heaven have none so soft and weak as water, yet none can surpass it in overcoming the strong.

Why is this so? All things are skilled in their own ways, yet none can rival it.

Thus, water extinguishes fire,
grinds and sharpens metal,
shatters horns and teeth,
yet harms no tongue or ear.
It humbles itself to conquer the proud and violent,
endures insult to triumph over great grudges—
all know this, all hear of it,
yet none act accordingly, for they follow their private desires without end.

Water’s mastery over strength,
softness over hardness—
all know it, yet none can practice it.

Thus, speaking brings ruin,
silence brings harm,
advancing invites calamity,
retreating invites blame.
Labor without virtue,
toil without reward—
brightness fades into obscurity,
long endurance sinks into darkness,
greatness turns to smallness,
preservation leads to ruin.

Therefore, enlightened kings and sage rulers, when inheriting a state,
must make solemn vows:
to bear the nation’s filth,
to be its sovereign;
to endure the nation’s misfortunes,
to be its king of all.

This is what the sage said.
What is meant by bearing the nation’s filth?
It means:
to eat what the people spit out,
to wear what the people discard,
to dwell where the people are sent,
to find joy in the people’s suffering,
to strive only in serving the people,
never pausing to attend to oneself.

Thus, the people entrust them as a father,
love them as a mother,
willing to be their servants,
to die with them together.
Therefore, even in barren lands of cold and stone,
remote and desolate regions,
they turn humiliation into honor,
preserve their ancestral line,
transform calamity into blessing,
and endure as the people’s lord.
This is called bearing the nation’s filth,
and thus they become the sovereign of the state.

What is meant by enduring the nation’s misfortunes?
It means:
to endure what the people despise,
to bear what the people hate,
to face the people’s greatest calamities,
yet not consider it virtue,
to plan for the nation’s ruin,
yet not lose Heaven’s favor,
to consider death,
yet not lose the people’s blessing—
Heaven and Earth bow with them,
all creatures rise and fall with them,
they follow east and west,
attach to south and north.
Where they act, ruin follows;
where they scheme, submission comes.
The world unites as one domain,
all turn toward the wind and embrace transformation,
none fail to receive its blessings.

Thus, they can rectify the crooked and pacify chaos,
conquer without resistance,
transform decadence into simplicity,
achieve great virtue and boundless renown.
This is called enduring the nation’s misfortunes,
and thus they become the king of all.

Why is this so?
Because their hearts are soft, their wills weak,
they value others above themselves,
and find ease in humiliation.

Thus, upright speech seems contrary,
yet none can overturn it;
near yet seems distant,
yet none can fathom it;
seeking it from afar,
yet none can attain it—
all lies within oneself.

How so?
Luxury lies within oneself,
yet they appear frugal to others;
wickedness lies within themselves,
yet they seek righteousness from the people;
disaster is invited by themselves,
yet they pray for blessings to Heaven—
Heaven and the spirits show them,
yet they cannot see;
the spirits warn them,
yet they cannot hear.

Abandoning this, they turn to harmony of heart,
their actions here resonate with Heaven,
rejecting themselves while blaming others—
the world falls into great confusion.

They rely on clear laws,
execute punishments with sincerity,
their words and deeds are trustworthy,
rewards and punishments are just,
public and impartial—
yet they exceed Heaven’s intent,
uprightness without deceit—
yet they lose the people’s hearts.
When punishments and executions are used together,
evil only grows;
when rewards are deep and gifts heavy,
chaos only increases.

At such times,
the virtuous are ensnared,
the wise fall under law—
though they gain reputation and substance,
how can it be good?

This is called pacifying great grudges,
yet leaving lingering resentment—
how can it be called good?

Thus, the sage holds the Dao’s token,
grasps virtue’s sincerity,
and unites it within themselves,
never demanding it of others.

Therefore, a ruler of virtue,
when they wish to act,
must consult Heaven first;
when they wish to proceed,
must verify the token’s truth.
They seek faults within themselves,
never blame the people;
they accept calamity upon themselves,
never resent others.
Thus, the sage holds the left contract
and does not demand accountability from others.

Therefore, right and wrong are self-determined,
black and white are self-divided—
before they act, the world responds;
before they command, all things comply.
Virtue governs the contract.

The unvirtuous,
pursuing their own desires,
ignoring the people’s needs,
lose governance and invite chaos,
seek no reflection in themselves,
yet blame the people’s failures,
enforce harsh punishments—
when people have faults,
families bear guilt,
the populace seethes with resentment,
Heaven’s will is unfulfilled,
their nation falls into disorder,
and future generations suffer.
The unvirtuous govern the traces.

Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth
moves with all things,
neither favoring nor rejecting,
neither distant nor close—
responding in kind, like echo to sound,
stillness and motion in harmony, like shadow to form,
neither crooked nor flattering,
upright as constant—
evil meets negation,
goodness meets passage,
softness and weakness find accord,
non-action aligns with harmony.

Heaven’s Dao has no favorites,
yet it always sides with the virtuous—
truth is never empty.

**Chapter on Small States and Few People**
Small states, few people—
narrow and few in number.

Let people have ten or a hundred measures of grain,
wealth and treasures unused—
let them practice frugality.
Let them value death,
find fulfillment in their place—
let them not wander far,
find contentment in their homeland.

Though they have carriages and boats,
their wealth is unused—
the people are simple and unadorned.
Though they have armor and arms in store,
they have no need to display them—
great harmony arises.

Let them use knotted cords for records,
returning to ancient simplicity.
Their food is plain, without refined flavors;
their clothing is plain, without fine colors;
their customs are convenient, aligned with the Dao;
their dwellings are secure, self-sustaining.

Neighboring states are visible,
yet each guards their own—
the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard,
yet few are true friends.
People live to old age,
fulfilling their natural span,
rarely traveling or visiting others.

**Conclusion:**
States vary in size,
lands in difficulty,
people in number,
wealth in abundance,
forms in height and low,
paths in distance,
strength in power,
authority in weight.

The great overcome the small,
the easy overcome the difficult,
the rich overcome the poor,
the many overcome the few,
the high overcome the low,
the near overcome the far,
the strong overcome the weak,
the light overcome the heavy—
this is the natural order of things.

Strength and weakness depend on the general,
safety and peril rest with the minister,
gain and loss lie with the ruler,
life and death hinge on the Dao.

Heaven does not always favor,
the people do not always dwell in one place—
those of virtue gather to them,
those without virtue are abandoned—
this is the natural Way.

Thus, vast lands and numerous people,
brave generals and stern rulers,
are insufficient to ensure strength;
sturdy armor and seasoned troops,
high walls and deep moats,
are insufficient to ensure safety;
persuasive speech and flattering words,
false compliance and fawning,
are insufficient to earn loyalty;
ceding territory and offering treasures,
forming alliances or counter-alliances,
gathering factions and thriving in power,
are insufficient to ensure survival.

Only those who embody the Dao
can master all things—
with virtue profound and grace abundant,
they turn the small into the great,
the weak into the strong,
the light into the heavy,
the few into the many.

Thus, the virtuous ruler, though in a small state,
must necessarily endure;
the unvirtuous ruler, though in a great state,
shall inevitably perish.

Therefore, the ruler of a small state,
with narrow lands and few people,
shallow virtue and light authority,
unregarded by neighboring lords,
whose laws fail to restrain,
who lacks natural barriers of hills and rivers,
nor the protection of allied states,
isolated and alone among great powers—
whose land is barren and unworthy of sacrifice,
whose treasures are meager and unworthy of offering,
whose generals and ministers do not align,
whose people are easily swayed,
whose neighbors seek to exploit—
such a state, without the steadfastness of a mountain,
nor the security of a highland,
dwells perpetually in the peril of a stacked egg.

Yet to attack it would not be tyranny,
nor would its virtue be excessive—
for the small state is the hinge of ruin and the pivot of peace.

The ruler of a small state, prone to peril and defeat,
must cultivate humility and the Dao,
daily increasing his virtue—
thus it is called the hinge of ruin and the pivot of peace.

Therefore, the sage who governs a small state
transforms misfortune into fortune,
converts danger into security.

Let there be abundance in boats and chariots,
let there be stores of armor and arms,
let tools and implements be convenient,
let food and clothing be plentiful,
let cattle and horses multiply,
let granaries overflow—
yet tenfold the wealth of neighboring states,
to secure the people’s hearts.

Though capable, do not act;
though wise, do not scheme;
let flavors be simple, unrefined,
let kitchens be plain, undecorated;
sever sensory indulgence, reject ornamentation—
let the ruler set the example,
drink before eating,
labor before resting,
wear a single layer in summer,
a double layer in winter,
seeking only harmony and ease,
not indulging in fine garments,
laboring only for life’s necessities,
not for gluttony—
let taxes be light and few,
so the people have surplus strength.

Cut off the roots of aggression,
and let the flow of wealth increase—
let customs grow sincere and frugal,
let loyalty and sincerity flourish,
let abundance seem like scarcity,
let capability seem like deficiency.

This is how the virtuous ruler
makes a small state with few people
possess tenfold wealth yet not use it.

Why is this so?

Establish it with the Dao,
embrace it with virtue,
share labor and ease, danger and security,
with the people as one.

Let the heart be balanced and harmonious,
listen to verify substance,
speak with reverence and humility,
to exalt the spirit,
let wisdom and virtue shine,
to correct errant tendencies—
then neighboring states will not stir,
the people will be united and content,
delighting in life and secure in longevity,
avoiding banditry and crime.

At such times, without bells and drums,
all things are sufficient,
the people are in harmony,
and ruler and subjects are in accord.
Attached to their land and content with life,
they die in their native hills and valleys.
Even if offered a hundredfold gain,
they will not abandon their homeland—
this is how one makes death precious
and prevents emigration.

Families have boats and chariots,
yet no need to transport or ride them;
households possess armor and arms,
yet no need to wield or display them.
Though boats and chariots exist,
they are not used;
though armor and arms exist,
they are not marshaled.

Why is this?

「Generals and ministers clearly understand the Dao/Way of the ruler,
the people diligently till and weave,
accumulating wealth as their aim.
When the ruler embodies humility and simplicity,
softness and weakness are esteemed,
loyalty and respect are prized,
while cleverness is held low and labor is valued.
With laws clear and customs settled,
superior and inferior mutually safeguard each other,
orders need not be given yet the people comply,
battles need not be fought yet enemies tremble.
Those who seek profit do not debate the difficulty of victory,
those who chase fame do not scheme to avoid blame.

Thus, the realm stands alone in tranquility,
the people undisturbed.
Discarding artifice and embracing sincerity,
they return to the simplicity of primordial times.

With knotted cords they mark the seasons,
in unadorned hearts they speak of truth,
simplifying things and refining words—
few in speech, few in schemes—
all in accord with Nature,
each finding their proper place.

This is what is called
*restoring the knotted cords* while using them.

Plain food and coarse gruel,
lacking flavor yet deemed sweet;
homespun cloth and deer-hide garments,
without patterns yet deemed fine.

Sweet their food, fine their garments.
Steep cliffs and perilous paths,
though treacherous, bring peaceful repose;
remote valleys and distant lands,
though harsh, are seen as deep virtue;
harmonious customs and familiar ways,
adapted to the land’s climate and terrain.

They delight in their customs,
rest in their homes.
When the Dao/Way flourishes and virtue abounds,
harmony extends to widows and orphans,
boundaries are respected, each guarding their own.

Neighboring states lie in sight,
yet spirits are unexhausted,
souls unbroken,
lives complete and desires fulfilled.

The sounds of roosters and dogs reach one another,
people gather firewood and vegetables,
climb hills to catch sight of kin,
share streams and rivers for bathing—
though distant, they do not conspire with ruler or subject,
nor gather in forbidden assemblies.
Each content with their own,
from birth to old age,
from old age to death,
without passing on authority or engaging in fraternization.

That the people do not fraternize until death
is because of the utmost *non-action* (無為),
and thus human desires are nonexistent.

*Sincere words are not ornate*—
sincere words are not ornate because they are direct,
ornate words are not sincere because they are flattering.
The wise do not indulge in broad knowledge—
*returning to the root* is their principle.
The broad-minded do not attain wisdom—
their pursuits are too manifold.
The virtuous do not argue—
*silent integrity* is their nature.
The eloquent do not possess virtue—
they adorn speech to deceive.

Thus, the Sage does not hoard the Dao/Way—
its clarity is self-evident.
When it is applied to the people, the Dao/Way is put into practice,
and the Sage’s own benefit deepens.
When it is fully given to the people, the Dao/Way is transmitted,
and the Sage’s own benefit overflows.

The Dao/Way of Heaven is both *yin* and *yang*,
beneficial yet not harmful—
its purpose is to nurture life.

The Sage’s Dao/Way avoids display and honor,
acts yet does not contend for merit or fame.

*Returning to the source*:
The interplay of emptiness and reality,
presence and absence,
cold and heat,
clarity and obscurity.
When *yin* wanes, *yang* flourishes;
when *yang* flourishes, *yin* wanes.
If the root is strong, the branches endure;
if the branches perish, the root decays.
The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is the mechanism of transformation.

All these principles—
the gateways to wisdom,
the origins of sincerity,
the measure of doubt and suspicion,
the scales of dazzling display—
are grasped by observing their roots,
cultivating their essence,
aligning with Heaven’s intent,
supervising by Nature’s law,
refining to their core,
simplifying to their truth.
To discern the near and know the far,
to observe what is hidden and reveal what is inverted,
to hear of names and recognize their substance,
to see beginnings and foresee endings,
to listen to sounds and perceive forms—
thus to illustrate gain and loss.

Then this is the *resonance of ten thousand years*,
a shared method for all ages,
the visible heart of Heaven and Earth,
and the complete intent of spirits and deities—
what of human affairs?

This is the natural order of the world,
the common essence of all people.

When one harbors the Dao/Way of Nature,
understands the logic of human sentiment,
holds fast to the primal *造化* (creative transformation),
and grasps the distinctions of *紀* (order/principle),
then harsh words strike the mark,
plainness harmonizes with virtue—
this is called *sincerity*.

The inferior look up to the superior,
and the superior depend on this.
The source of strength and authority,
the origin of commands and threats,
the aid of the people,
the foundation of success,
the basis of power and influence,
the rise of titles and renown—
all stem from here.

The Dao/Way is plain and unadorned,
without embellishment or taste.
Thus, sincere words are not ornate,
yet deeds are accomplished and truth is revealed.

So one voice sings and a thousand voices respond,
one moves and ten thousand follow.
Crushing mighty foes,
trapping great armies,
rushing into peril like water and fire—
dying without hesitation,
yet the people hold no resentment—
this is *sincerity*.

Though *sincerity* is not ornate,
its benefit is profound.
Sweet-talking and persuasive,
endless flattery and grand promises—
this is called *lack of sincerity*.

What is *lack of sincerity*?
Words that do not align with truth—
this is *lack of sincerity*.

When a person lacks sincerity,
virtue and grace cannot be established,
commands and threats cannot prevail,
power and influence cannot shine,
titles and renown are unclear.
Bestowing rewards does not inspire obedience,
inflicting punishments does not deter crime.
Thus, superiors and inferiors do not unite,
undertakings fail,
though one may be noble yet without position,
high yet without followers,
lonely and isolated,
the ancestral altars and states unsettled,
the world expecting salvation,
only to meet with ruin and punishment—
this is the harm of *sweet words*.

Sweet words without substance,
ornate yet untrue.

*Reverting to the root and returning to the origin*,
abandoning superficiality and discarding artifice,
primordial and fundamental,
few in means yet vast in effect,
one in response yet encompassing all,
refining to control the elaborate,
simplifying to uphold the singular—
this is called *limited knowledge*.

*Limited knowledge* thus enables wisdom.
The wise do not indulge in broad knowledge.

What is *wisdom*?
To grasp human sentiment and penetrate divine insight—
this is *wisdom*.
The wise are the safeguards of the body,
the instruments for unifying the realm.
The superior’s reliance,
the inferior’s attachment,
the path to Heaven’s guidance,
the road to the Dao/Way’s truth.

Thus, they encompass the grand scope of safety and peril,
hold the utmost keys to order and chaos,
so that all within the seas are loyal and exert their utmost,
dividing duties and fulfilling their roles,
to bring peace to their superiors.
Power and influence flow freely,
authority and virtue flourish greatly—
this is *wisdom*.

Though the wise do not indulge in broad knowledge,
their achievements are profound—
as it is said: *Know one thing, and all ten thousand things are known*.

The mind perceives myriad details,
the eyes survey human affairs,
yet without exhaustive limits—
when ministers scatter in confusion,
this is called *broad knowledge*.

*Broad knowledge* thus leads to ignorance.
The broad-minded do not attain wisdom.

What is *ignorance*?
To doubt Heaven’s Dao/Way,
to suspect human affairs—
this is *ignorance*.
The ignorant,
content in ease and pleasure,
internally consumed by endless thoughts,
externally driven by endless desires,
both loathe and hate,
easily lured to life,
easily coerced to death.»

The one who perceives the strange and is moved,
who fears danger and recoils,
who dazzles with superficial displays,
who deceives with shifting words and times,
who opposes what is open and rejects what is clear—
such a one falls into ruin and constraint,
whose actions neighbor calamity,
whose stillness borders disaster,
whose ancestral temples tremble in peril,
whose people scatter and depart—
this is *broad knowledge*.

This is the fate of the broad-minded who do not know.

When one is widely informed and open-minded,
yet speaks haltingly and is slow of tongue,
this is called *not eloquent*.

When one is drawn and drawn again, yet succeeds,
when one remains silent yet is trusted—
thus one achieves *virtue*.

The virtuous, though not eloquent, achieve virtue.

What is *virtue*?
When actions align with Heaven’s will,
when stillness attunes to Earth’s intent,
when words flow without obstruction,
when silence brings no harm—
this is *virtue*.

*Virtue* is the foundation of the noble,
the pinnacle of all conduct,
the convergence of auspiciousness,
the path of boundless blessings,
endless yet unexhausted,
used yet never depleted—
unaltered by ten thousand kings,
unchanged by diverse customs,
granted by Heaven and Earth,
enhanced by the numinous.

Thus, above it harmonizes with Heaven,
below it harmonizes with humanity—
the origin of governance,
the eternal principle of affairs,
the fulfillment of all things,
the sheltering of all life.
When the world reveres and follows it without end,
this is *virtue*.

Though the virtuous may not be eloquent,
they possess such achievements.

Not recognizing the fundamental source,
not perceiving the root origin,
defaming Heaven and Earth,
defaming humanity and spirits,
twisting words and altering intent—
this is called *eloquence*.

Clinging to suspicion, treading in doubt,
following desire while acting recklessly,
prizing fine words and empty rhetoric—
thus *vice* is born.

The eloquent are not virtuous.

What is *vice*?
When actions defy Heaven’s will,
when stillness contradicts Earth’s intent,
when words harm humanity and spirits—
this is *vice*.

Those of vice
divide the Dao and separate virtue,
dilute purity and corrupt sincerity,
alter and embellish speech,
lean on pretense while claiming benevolence,
fabricate omens and signs,
linking Earth and Heaven,
invoking masters and beasts—
though revered by the world,
they invert meaning and conceal truth,
fleeing substance for mere names,
dazzling others while remaining empty,
bewildering all without foundation,
abandoning truth for deceit,
striving to deceive the sovereign.

Adorning speech to please superiors,
forming factions to sway the ruler’s heart,
exposing the traces of favoritism,
sealing the path of loyalty and rectitude,
employing flattery to tilt the state’s authority—
thus they nurture violence and foster great deceit.
The world speaks ill, the age grows corrupt,
the ruler grows dim-witted,
obstruction and stagnation lead to peril and ruin—
this is *eloquence*.

Though eloquence is not virtuous,
its harm is thus manifest.

Therefore, the Sage guards against its beginnings,
cuts it off before it sprouts,
rejects eloquence and knowledge,
discards artifice and speech,
embracing emptiness, stillness, softness, and weakness,
mysterious silence, undyed truth,
concealing wisdom and virtue,
guiding all by naturalness.

Right and wrong, black and white,
are as clear as sun and moon;
same and different, true and false,
are as vast as Earth and Heaven.
Empty yet boundless, transforming with all things—
this is the Sage’s non-accumulation.

Acting without action,
harmonizing with all things,
nurturing yet never full,
dispersing yet never exhausted—
encompassing all directions.

The broad-minded ponder deeply,
yet see no thread;
the eloquent plan far ahead,
yet hear no beginning.
Extending without bending,
transforming without end,
returning to their start—
great clarity like darkness.
The more one gives to others, the more one possesses;
the more one exhausts for others, the brighter one becomes.
The more one nourishes others, the longer one lives;
the more one teaches others, the greater one’s gain.
The more one gives to others, the more one has;
the more one shares with others, the more one accumulates.

Both bright and dark,
dark yet again bright—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

Beneficial yet causing no harm,
aligned with Heaven and Earth,
giving life yet never killing,
communing with the numinous.

Establishing virtue and flowing blessings,
ever abiding in radiant honor,
yielding eloquence to let blessings return to namelessness,
acting yet not relying—
moving with the Dao.

Though Heaven’s Dao is beneficial yet causes no harm,
the Sage acts yet does not contend.

Though Heaven and humanity differ,
their benefits are the same.
Thus, aligning with Heaven’s Dao,
I have no separation.

**Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way;**
**Name that can be named is not the eternal Name.**
**The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,**
**The Named is the mother of all things.**

Thus, **when one always lacks desire, one may perceive its subtlety;**
**when one always has desire, one may perceive its peril.**

These two—though issuing from the same source yet bearing different names—
are both called **Mysterious/Profound (Xuan)**.
**Mysterious/Profound beyond measure,**
the gateway to all wonders.

**The Supreme Sage’s manifestation:**
None is loftier than **Dao/Virtue**,
None is grander than **Divine Clarity (Shenming)**,
None is vast as **Great Harmony (Taihe)**,
None is exalted as **Heaven and Earth**,
None is more intimate than **Yin and Yang**,
None is more luminous than the **Great Sage (Dasheng)**.

**Dao/Virtue** is that which can be spoken of yet cannot be exhaustively explained;
**Divine Clarity (Shenming)** is that which can be preserved yet cannot be fully articulated;
**Great Harmony (Taihe)** is that which can be embodied yet cannot be transformed;
**Heaven and Earth** are that which can be followed yet cannot be proclaimed;
**Yin and Yang** are that which can be utilized yet cannot be transmitted;
The **Great Sage (Dasheng)** is that which can be observed yet cannot be described.

Hence, **what can be measured is known, yet few know its limits;**
**what can be understood is shallow, yet few act upon its depths.**

The **most multitudinous of the multitudinous cannot be counted,**
the **most vast of the vast cannot be measured;**
**subtle and profound, exhausting principles—**
this is beyond the reach of mere wisdom.
**The utmost fulfillment—**
this cannot be attained through striving.
Between **Heaven and Earth**, calamities and chaos
cannot be overcome by human schemes.

Thus, **Dao/Way that cannot be spoken of is the eternal Dao/Way,**
**Virtue/Power that cannot be named is the eternal Virtue/Power—**
the origin of governance.
**Name that cannot be named,**
**achieving merit without ostentation—**
the root of transformation.

Therefore, **when rulers act,**
the people crave desires,
**abandoning purity and forsaking sincerity,**
**refining yet becoming coarse,**
**opening their ears and eyes,**
**enticing them with sounds and colors,**
**indulging them with the five flavors,**
**pleasing them with merit and reward,**
**guiding them with rites and propriety,**
the people are like those awakening from sleep,
emerging from a dark chamber,
ascending hills to gaze upon the eight directions,
beholding the **Big Dipper (Shenchen)** and **constellations (Cen)** to see the sun and moon.

Thus, **transformation can be articulated,**
**virtue can be enumerated,**
**merit can be recounted,**
**and names can be distinguished.**

Hence, **knowing yet flowing unrestrained,**
**evil and falsehood arise;**
**Dao/Virtue is obstructed,**
**Divine Clarity is severed;**
**a hundred flaws sprout,**
**Great Harmony is exhausted.**

The people wander in confusion, lost in the realm of right and wrong,
**losing their natural rhythms.**
**Emotions shift with the utmost transformations,**
**entangled with all things;**
**their faces grow wan and dark,**
**their hearts filled with sorrow and woe;**
**they do not find peace in life,**
**nor joy in their customs;**
**they lose their Heaven-ordained years,**
**all harmed by violence and tyranny.**

Thus, **sovereign and subject regard each other with anxious scheming,**
**father and child cling to one another with yearning,**
**brothers fret over one another with melancholy,**
**the common folk tremble in fear and shrink their bodies.**

**Shrinking their bodies yet clinging together,**
death comes swiftly—
this is the source of calamity and woe.
**Clinging with yearning,**
**fretting with melancholy,**
**nighttime vigil and morning inquiry,**
**words of distress and faces of anguish—**
this is the cause of untimely injury.

**When subjects behold their rulers,**
**their complexions lack composure,**
**they hurry in haste and bow with exertion,**
**shoulders hunched, elbows pressed,**
**prostrating themselves in obeisance,**
**crawling forward in submission—**
this is **not the way of true kinship.**

Thus, **Dao/Way that can be spoken of is Dao/Virtue made manifest, yet not the natural Way;**
**Name that can be named is fame and merit displayed, yet not the innate Truth.**

**(II)**
Having a name is not the Dao;
Being without a name is not the Dao.
Having action is not the Dao;
Being without action is not the Dao.
Without a name yet encompassing all names,
Without action yet accomplishing all deeds.

**(III)**
Without name, without trace,
Merging with the Divine,
The world relies upon it,
Yet none know its source—
Transforming from the Void,
It is the origin of Heaven and Earth.

**(IV)**
Those with names who embody transformation
Follow the Dao and virtue,
Revere the numinous,
Emulate Great Harmony,
Conform to Heaven and Earth,
Thus becoming the Mother of all things.

**(V)**
The desireless one gazes beyond expectation;
Observing its subtlety,
They attain the **Pure and Bright** [太清].

**(VI)**
The heart like metal and stone,
The form like withered wood,
Silent in seclusion,
With resolve as steadfast as a colt—
Such is the desireless one.
Restoring the root of life and essence.

Yet those with desires
Chase after transient things,
Losing the path of ease,
Seeing only the narrow confines,
Lost and unable to return,
They squander their true essence.

When all know beauty as beauty,
Then ugliness arises;
All know goodness as goodness,
Then not-goodness arises.

Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Long and short define each other,
High and low depend on each other,
Sounds harmonize with tones,
Before and after follow in sequence.

Therefore, the Sage acts without action,
Teaches without speech,
Yet all things arise without resistance—
Creates without possession,
Acts without reliance,
Accomplishes without claiming.
Because they do not claim,
Their power does not depart.

---

**(VII)**
Human cleverness can be restrained but not dispersed,
Human desires can be countered but not indulged.
Adorning one’s appearance harms one’s nature;
Indulging desires diminishes one’s vitality.
What the world calls "beautiful" and "good"
Is not the utmost beauty or goodness.
For the utmost beauty is not seen by the world,
The utmost goodness is not known by the world.

---

**(VIII)**
Without being, one cannot perceive having;
Without having, one cannot comprehend non-being.
Without difficulty, one cannot know ease;
Without ease, one cannot grasp difficulty.
Without long, one cannot know short;
Without short, one cannot know long.
Without mountains, one cannot know valleys;
Without valleys, one cannot know mountains.
Without tones, one cannot discern sounds;
Without sounds, one cannot recognize tones.
Without before, one cannot know after;
Without after, one cannot know before.

All these pairs—
Heaven and Earth’s proof,
Nature’s seal—
Are laid out in plain sight, yet some deny them,
Affirming or negating in sequence,
Reversing at their end.
The divine cannot evade them,
Yin and Yang cannot defy them.

From this, it is clear:
The affairs of the Sage-King cannot be forced by action.

---

**(IX)**
The radiant does not endure,
The obscure does not persist.
Honored splendor flourishes in mid-spring,
Yet wild greens and millet thrive at autumnal equinox.
On the winter solstice, all things grow lush;
On the summer solstice, all things sigh in sorrow.

---

**(X)**
Only those who dare not rest complacently
And continually cultivate their virtue
Forget their deeds while their virtue remains—
Thus they do not claim yet do not lose it.
Their transformation aligns with the Dao,
They do not expect reward,
Their virtue equals Heaven’s,
They do not seek repayment,
Hiding their deeds, evading fame,
Deep in the mysterious realm.
Though they do not claim,
Their virtue does not depart.

---

**Chapter: Not Valuing the Skilled**

Do not value the skilled,
So the people do not compete;
Do not treasure rare goods,
So the people do not steal;
Do not display what is desirable,
So the people’s hearts remain undisturbed.

Thus, the Sage’s governance:
Empties their minds, fills their bellies;
Weakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.
Always keep the people without knowledge, without desire,
So even the wise dare not act.

Act with *wuwei*,
And nothing remains untended.

---

**(XI)**
When the world extols rites and morality,
People compete, yet fall short—
Then hypocrisy arises.

---

**(XII)**
Those with abundant virtue rule,
Those with meager virtue serve.
The worthy are rare—one in ten thousand,
The Sage appears not every age.

---

**(XIII)**
As when a slow horse and a swift steed race on level ground,
Or a wild goose and a partridge fly in the blue sky—
Then the worthy and unworthy become clear.

---

**(XIV)**
Hoarding jewels and jade makes people seek them,
Yet scarcity breeds theft.
Displaying music and dance delights people,
Yet excess leads to licentiousness.

---

**(XV)**
If the world does not value the skilled,
The people do not vie for them—
No vying, no strife, no chaos.
If the world does not treasure goods,
The people do not covet—
No coveting, no theft.
If the world abandons music and dance,
The people feel no joy—
No joy, no pleasure, no licentiousness.
This is the natural order.

---

**(XVI)**
Empty the mind, calm the breath,
Focus the essence, gather the spirit.
Silent and without action,
Serene and without governance.

---

**(XVII)**
Offer no titles or rewards,
Yet filial piety arises naturally;
Impose no punishments,
Yet deceit ceases on its own.
Return to the true, restore the simple,
Revert to the origin.
The ruler acts with *wuwei*,
Heaven and humanity interact effortlessly;
Soaring in natural harmony,
All things govern themselves.

---

**Chapter: The Dao’s Pervasiveness**

The Dao is boundless yet can be used without exhaustion—
Deep, like the origin of all things.
It dulls the sharp,
Unravels the tangled,
Blends its radiance,
Aligns with the dust.
It sinks like the unseen—
I do not know whose child it is,
Yet it precedes the Sovereign.

---

**(XVIII)**
The Dao is supremely void,
Thus its action is supremely unrestrained.
Virtue is supremely without,
Thus its action is supremely harmonious.
All things receive it—
None escape its unrestrained, harmonious flow.

The application of Dao and virtue is the constant of the numinous,
The path followed by Heaven and Earth, the principle revered by yin and yang.

**(XIX)**
That which is supremely void is not void,
That which is supremely harmonious is not harmonious.
Only by not striving for voidness and harmony
Does one attain true voidness and harmony.
Voidness takes emptiness as its dwelling;
Harmony takes *wuwei* as its home.
To be able to empty and to be without,
Is to have surplus voidness;
To be able to be without and to empty,
Is to always align with harmony.

**(XX)**
To have resolve yet no sharpness,
To have intent yet no scheming,
To devise what is not devised,
To plan what is not planned.

---
**Chapter: Heaven and Earth’s Impartiality**
Heaven and Earth are not benevolent,
Yet they treat all things as sacred offerings;
The Sage is not benevolent,
Yet he treats the people as sacred offerings.
Between Heaven and Earth—
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet unyielding,
Moving yet ever producing.

Much speech leads to exhaustion;
Better to guard the center.

---
**(XXI)**
Heaven is high and clear,
Earth is deep and tranquil;
Yin and yang intermingle,
Harmonious *qi* flows freely,
Serene and without contrivance—
All things arise spontaneously.

Heaven and Earth do not incline their hearts or shift their intentions,
Exhaust their spirits, or labor in affairs.
With sorrowful yearning, they bestow love and profit,
Spread kindness and abundance,
And yet complete all things without effort.

The enlightened ruler and sage,
Upholding Dao and harmony,
Remains clear and tranquil, unchanging,
Adapting with singular transformation,
Reaching subtly and silently,
Conforming to Dao’s manner—
The world responds,
All things transform naturally.

The Sage does not exhaust his wisdom or abilities,
Agitate his mind or unsettle his resolve,
Drain his essence or weary his spirit,
Cease from contemplation or fret in distraction,
Yet benevolence arises from action,
And he governs myriad lives without contrivance.

---
**(XXII)**
If Heaven and Earth abandon emptiness for love and profit,
Their transformations falter,
Things do not flourish fully.
If the Sage abandons emptiness for love and profit,
His virtue does not spread universally,
The realm does not unite,
His grace does not reach deeply,
His deeds do not complete fully.

Why?
The art of transforming through love has limits,
Yet the myriad things’ dependence on transformation is boundless.
To wield a limited measure against an endless demand
Is like trying to replenish a dried river with tears.

---
**(XXIII)**
When lice and fleas move upon the hair,
Sleep becomes restless;
When mosquitoes and gnats cling to the skin,
The spirit grows agitated, thought obstructed;
When stung by wasps or hornets,
The heart is pierced with pain;
Even without harm to ears and eyes,
All limbs grow useless.

---
**(XXIV)**
Heaven and Earth speak not,
Yet through their boundless emptiness,
They attain the harmony of all things,
And bring forth without end.
The Sage speaks not,
But his laws are void yet all things conform to them.

The prison of Heaven is vast yet holds no restraint,
The spirits and gods are tranquil yet act not.
The world drifts in ease,
Ignorant yet unknowing, yet great harmony prevails.

---
**(XXV)**
Words spoken invite calamity,
Words lost bring death to the self.

---
**Chapter: "The Valley Spirit Never Dies"**
The Valley Spirit never dies,
This is called the Mysterious Feminine.
The gate of the Mysterious Feminine,
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Endless yet as if it exists,
Used without depletion.

---
**(XXVI)**
The Dao of Great Harmony—subtle *qi*,
Things born from it are divine.
Emptiness and voidness are its home,
Stillness and solitude its constant.
Coming and going have no opening,
Forward and backward have no obstruction.
In motion, nothing is not accomplished,
In stillness, nothing is not formed.
Transforming yet not transforming,
Giving birth yet not giving birth.

---
**(XXVII)**
The Feminine, though yielding and soft,
Can give birth.
The Mysterious, though deep and distant,
Is unseen.
Though it bears all things like a mother,
None can obscure its form.

---
**(XXVIII)**
The Dao of Great Harmony gives birth yet does not die,
Begins yet does not end.
It opens and guides the divine and enlightened,
As the root and origin of Heaven and Earth.

---
**(XXIX)**
Motion and stillness are profound and wondrous,
As if nonexistent, as if existing.
It accomplishes things and fulfills affairs,
In nothing does it fail.
Shining yet not extinguished,
Used without depletion—
For its birth is not born,
Its form is without shape.

---
**Chapter: "Heaven and Earth Endure Long"**
Heaven and Earth endure long.
Heaven and Earth endure long because they do not generate themselves,
Thus they endure long in generating.
Therefore the Sage places his self last, yet his self is first,
Sets his self aside, yet his self is preserved.
Is this not because he has no private desires?
Thus he can fulfill his private desires.

---
**(XXX)**
The Sage’s awe shakes the eight directions,
His wisdom penetrates the four quarters.
He entrusts his deliberations to desirelessness,
Returns his plans to non-action.
He humbles himself to honor Heaven,
Sets himself aside to benefit the people—
Thus he accomplishes without acting,
Commands without speaking,
And the people willingly serve him.

Therefore, he places others first and reverses his own self to conform to the Dao,
Sets himself aside to benefit the people—
His deeds are vast yet unseen,
His virtue is high yet unheard.
His transformation flows with the divine and enlightened,
His longevity aligns with the mountains and rivers—
Thus he endures.

---
**Chapter: "The Supreme Good is Like Water"**
The supreme good is like water.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
Dwells where people revile it—
Thus it approaches the Dao.
Residing, it is good as Earth,
In heart, it is good as the depths,
In giving, it is good in kindness,
In speech, it is good in trust,
In governance, it is good in rectitude,
In action, it is good in capability,
In timing, it is good in motion.

Only because it does not contend,
It has no grievances.

---
**(XXXI)**
Man, in body soft yet spirit weak,
Descends from heights to lows,
Endures humiliation like Earth,
Holds filth like the sea,
His words conform to the hearts of others,
His self is last among people.
Where people revile, he alone abides,
Serene as if heartless,
Drifting as if selfless,
Ever-changing yet constant—
Flowing with the Dao.
To relinquish the self and follow nature,
None surpasses water.
Emperors embody it, using it to govern.
Its virtue is subtle and profound—
What grievances could there be?

---
**Chapter: "Hold and It Will Be Full"**
Hold and it will be full,
Yet not as good as letting it go.
Grasp and it will slip away,
Yet cannot be long preserved.
Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can guard them.
Riches and honor bring arrogance,
Yet invite one’s own doom.
When deeds are accomplished, withdraw the self—
This is the Dao of Heaven.

---
**(XXXII)**
Pursuing wealth and honor in times of abundance,
One accumulates fortune and goods—
The heavier the goods, the more the divine and enlightened are drained.
Wealth and goods piled up bring calamity and doom—
Better than having fullness and stopping.

---
**(XXXIII)**
To sharpen the heart and focus the will,
To strategize and plot—
Wisdom and ability bring rank and honor,
Fame and influence advance the self.
The divine departs,
How can peace be long preserved?

---
**(XXXIV)**
Riches and honor to me,
Are like ascending a mountain to gaze afar.
Fame and power to me,
Are like a fleeting bolt of lightning.

---
**(XXXV)**
Gold and jade compared to the self,
Fame and power compared to the divine—
Like ice and charcoal,
Their essences cannot coexist.
Thus fame is the defilement of the divine,
Profit is the harm to the self.
Nurturing the divine’s defilement,
Accumulating the self’s harm—
It diminishes what I have accomplished,
And increases what I have failed.
Gaining it is deemed as profit,
Losing it is deemed as harm—
Then one’s thoughts grow muddled,
And inclinations perverse.

---
**(XXXVI)**
Wealth that benefits me harms my divine,
Fame that gives me birth destroys my self.
Calamity arises from within me,
Not from others.
Fortune arises from within me,
Not from Heaven.

---
**(XXXVII)**
Riches and honor without arrogance,
Easy to say, yet hard to practice.
The higher the self’s station,
The more distant the will must be.

But when one is wealthy and noble yet remains arrogant,
It is like a torch seeking fire—
The brighter the torch, the more swiftly it burns away;
Can one not be cautious?

---
**(Chapter XXXVIII: *Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing Oneness*)**
To bear the vital essence and embrace oneness,
How could one remain detached?
To focus one’s *qi* and attain supreme softness,
How could one not be like an infant?
To purify and remove all obscurity,
How could one not be flawless?
To love the people and govern the state,
How could one not be without knowledge?
To open and close the celestial gates,
How could one not be without partiality?
To be clear and unobstructed in all directions,
How could one not act without contrivance?
To give birth to them, to nourish them,
To give birth yet not possess them,
To act yet not claim credit,
To grow yet not dominate—
This is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.

---
**(Chapter XXXVIII: *The Mysterious Virtue*)**
Not possessing, not claiming,
Not giving birth yet not slaughtering—
Transformation unfathomable,
Heaven and Earth govern themselves.
Abandoning ornamentation and discarding excess,
Returning to the origin, reverting to the beginning—
Disaster ceases from within me,
Chaos vanishes from others.
Fortune springs from Heaven,
Virtue arises from Earth.
Yet in quietude, ever turning,
All things are harmonized and balanced.
Its virtue is profound and dark,
No one can see or hear it.

---
**(Chapter XXXVIII: *Thirty Spokes and the Central Axis*)**

**(Chapter XXXIX: *The Shepherding of the People in the Primordial Age*)**
In the Age of Great Antiquity, the sage shepherded the people,
Following what Heaven and Earth naturally did,
Not resorting to clever schemes.
They drank from gourds,
They ate with their hands—
All things were equal and balanced,
No distinction between high and low.

When rulers began to act with purpose,
They imposed heavy taxes and laborious duties,
The people grew exhausted beyond measure,
While the sovereign’s demands never ceased.
Their tributes came from distant lands,
Men and women carried burdens they could not bear,
And thus the clever devised the wheel hub,
To harness horses and oxen,
To bear heavy loads and travel far,
To ease the people’s toil.

Later generations followed this path,
And artificial refinements multiplied.
The wheels were painted with stripes and red,
Adorned with gold and silver,
And embellished with jade ornaments.
The cost of a single chariot
Was enough to impoverish a family.

Thus, Laozi lamented the harm of contrivance to **Dao/Way** and **virtue**,
Illustrating how well-intentioned action breeds disaster and chaos.
Hence, he cited the three cases—chariot, vessel, dwelling—
To explain how **having** and **non-having**,
**utility** and **use**,
Interdependently lead to both benefit and ruin.
This was his warning to all.

---

**(Chapter XL: *The Decay of Dao and Virtue*)**
When **Dao/Way** and **virtue** decline,
Worries assail from within,
While yin and yang ravage without.
The people grow frail and emaciated,
Plagued by disease.
Thus, water and fire rise together,
The five flavors take form,
Raw and cooked are not distinguished,
Dry and damp are not separated.
The clever then knead clay to make vessels,
To cook sour and salty foods.
This leads to hunting and indulgence,
To slaughtering all living things,
To piercing wombs and killing eggs,
To gratify the ruler’s desires.
They carve and polish pearls and jade,
To fashion bowls and plates,
And refine crude materials into tools—
All this to such an extent.

---

**(Chapter XLI: *The Corruption of Human Nature and Its Consequences*)**
Once human hearts are corrupted,
All things grow resentful and hateful.
Serpents and venomous creatures rise,
Birds and beasts harm mankind.
Thus, even caves and hollows
Are no longer sufficient to ward off calamity,
To preserve one’s life,
Or to complete one’s natural span.
The clever then devise dwellings:
Roofed with beams, walled with eaves,
Windows pierced for surveillance,
Gates fortified with locks,
Openings and closures made swift and sharp—
So that wasps and insects cannot enter,
And birds and beasts cannot approach.

Yet later generations consider this governance,
While earlier ones saw it as chaos.
For this is the flaw of **having** and **non-having**,
**utility** and **use**,
Interdependently leading to both order and disorder—
It lies in the hands of humanity alone.

---
**Five Colors**

**Five Colors**

The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deafen the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate,
Galloping and hunting drive the heart to madness,
Rare treasures lead to errant conduct.

Thus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes,
And discards the one to embrace the other.

*(Wang Bi’s commentary on Laozi, Chapter 12)*

(42) To indulge in the shifting allure of the five colors
Is to gaze without perceiving the forms of calamity and fortune—
A spear piercing the eyes.

To revel in the shifting tones of the five sounds
Is to listen without hearing the voices of auspice and omen—
A plug sealing the ears.

To delight in the shifting flavors of the five tastes
Is to taste without discerning the truth of right and wrong—
A blade to sever the tongue.

*(Qiang Sici’s Tang-era *Moral Teachings of the Dao De Jing*, Exalted Virtue Commentary)*

(43) To take pleasure in the shifting thrills of hunting and pursuit
Is to let the mind fall into frenzy and delusion.
Hunting and pursuit are the generals of frenzy and delusion.

*(Qiang Sici’s Tang-era *Moral Teachings of the Dao De Jing*, Exalted Virtue Commentary)*

(44) To covet the shifting allure of wealth and goods
Is to let the mind stray into perverse inclinations.
Wealth and goods are things that harm the root.

*(Qiang Sici’s Tang-era *Moral Teachings of the Dao De Jing*, Exalted Virtue Commentary)*

(45) The Sage wears the color of no-color,
Listens to the sound of no-sound,
Tastes the flavor of no-flavor,
Gallops through realms of no-boundaries,
Traverses paths of no-limits,
Casts nets of no-form—
And thus attains the heart of Dao and virtue!

*(Qiang Sici’s Tang-era *Moral Teachings of the Dao De Jing*, Exalted Virtue Commentary)*

**Chapter on Treating Favor and Insult as Startling**

---

**Chapter on Treating Favor and Insult as Startling**

Treating favor and insult as startling,
One esteems great calamities as if they were one’s own self.

What is meant by *treating favor and insult as startling*?
Favor is a lowly thing—
To receive it is startling,
To lose it is startling;
This is what is meant by *treating favor and insult as startling*.

What is meant by *esteeming great calamities as if they were one’s own self*?
The reason I have great calamities
Is that I have a self.
And when I have no self,
What great calamities do I have?
Thus, to value one’s self as the foundation of all under Heaven,
Is as if one could entrust all under Heaven;
To love one’s self as the foundation of all under Heaven,
Is as if one could be trusted by all under Heaven.

---

**Chapter on the Unseen Vision**

(46) Rest the mind in the Dao and virtue,
Preserve the will in divine clarity,
Harmony as the central sovereign,
Serene as if not born.

Plans without calculation,
Nurture the heavens and earth;
Concerns without deliberation,
Soar through the boundless void.
Presence and absence in transformation,
Not regarded as strange.
Honor and disgrace, exaltation and abasement,
No lack or excess in them.

Great virtue perishes in the self,
Thus great calamities cannot befall,
And the Heavenly Net cannot ensnare.

---

**Chapter on the Unseen Vision**

(46) What cannot be seen is called *Yi* (平易, simplicity),
What cannot be heard is called *Xi* (希, subtlety),
What cannot be grasped is called *Wei* (微, faintness).
These three cannot be defined in words,
Thus they merge into one.
Above, it does not dazzle,
Below, it does not obscure—
Its threads are indistinct, yet it cannot be named,
Returning to the formless.
This is called the *State of the Unseen* (无状之状),
The *Form of the Formless* (无物之象),
This is called *Hunhuang* (惚恍, indistinct yet discernible).

Pursue it, yet you cannot see its head,
Follow it, yet you cannot see its tail.
Hold to the ancient Dao,
To govern the present with its naturalness—
One who knows the ancient beginning,
This is called *Dao’s Pattern* (道纪).

---

(47) Before the great goose is formed,
If one cracks its egg and examines it,
It is not yet a goose.
Yet its shape and sound, head and tail,
Are already present in essence.
This is the goose that is not yet a goose.

How much more so when,
Before the egg of the great goose exists,
Creation and transformation already give it form!
Thus it is clear:
The origin of the *Tai Ji* (太极),
Before Heaven and Earth,
Already possesses indistinct shape and sound,
Though unseen and unheard.

To see without using sight,
To hear without using hearing,
To grasp without clinging,
To speak without words—
This is how one discerns.

Therefore,
The *Form without Form* (无形之形),
From which Heaven and Earth arise,
Is called *Yi*.
The *Sound without Sound* (无声之声),
From which the five tones begin,
Is called *Xi*.
The *Thread without Thread* (无绪之绪),
From which myriad things emerge,
Is called *Wei*.

---

(48) Profound and vast, it returns to emptiness,
Its curves shape all things, allowing them to exist.
Exhausting the subtle, reaching the mysterious,
All things find their fulfillment.
Flowing through all directions,
No trace of its absence can be seen.

---

(49) The *State of the Unseen* (无状之状),
Yet it shapes all states;
The *Form of the Formless* (无象之象),
Yet it mirrors all forms;
Its light shines in *Hunhuang* (惚恍),
Yet it reveals all things.
Great yet appearing small,
Present yet appearing lost.

---

(50) Holding to the ancient Dao’s naturalness,
To govern the present without altering its simplicity for barbarians,
Or changing its form for the Central States.
With one principle, know the beginning,
With one principle, know the end—
Reverence the Dao’s commands,
And all things hang suspended.

It governs all without exception,
It oversees all without fail—
Its duties are vast and great,
Nothing it does not fulfill.
As the *Empty Framework* (虚纲纪),
It is the progenitor of Heaven and Earth.

---

The Guest:
Adapting to circumstances yet not innovating,
Following the Dao and yielding to Heaven.
Always as a respectful guest,
Not altering the halls for the host,
Nor changing his wives and concubines.

Ice:
Ever yin yet never yang,
Quiet yet never clamorous,
Adapting to events and shifting with things.
Soft and yielding, smooth and supple,
It can adapt to all—
Like winter’s accumulation as ice,
Spring’s release as water—
Heaven’s timing in motion.

---

**Chapter on Attaining the Ultimate Void (致虚极章):**
Attain the ultimate void,
Hold fast to stillness with sincerity—
All things arise together,
And I observe their return.

Things teem and flourish,
Each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is stillness—
This is called restoring the vital breath.
Restoring the vital breath is constancy.
Knowing constancy is clarity;
Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings ruin.
Knowing constancy is tolerance.
Tolerance brings impartiality,
Impartiality brings kingship,
Kingship aligns with Heaven,
Heaven aligns with the Dao,
The Dao endures eternally.
Thus, one’s life remains unharmed.

---

**Moral Virtue and the Void:**
Dao and virtue are void and formless,
Thus they can bestow and receive.
Heaven and Earth are serene and tranquil,
Thus they can transform and change.
Yin and yang alternate,
Thus they can give life and bring death.
Sun and moon advance and retreat,
Thus they can radiate brilliance.
The four seasons begin and end,
Thus they can nurture and complete.

To discard the Void,
Dao and virtue cannot endure;
To abandon tranquility,
Heaven and Earth cannot exist;
To move without returning,
Yin and yang cannot harmonize;
To advance without retreat,
Sun and moon cannot shine;
To end without beginning,
All things cannot flourish.

Thus, being yet returning to non-being,
Substance yet yielding to emptiness—
The mind bears nothing,
The will is unobstructed.
Act without action, like a sealed vessel;
Unworried, like madness;
Embrace the True, tread the Pure;
Abandon cleverness,
Ignorance as the foremost virtue,
Emptiness as constancy—
Then the divine and luminous reach their peak,
And nature unfolds in its fullness!

Reflect upon actions inwardly,
Recollect thoughts to restore the spirit;
Hide myself in non-thought,
Carry my form in non-being;
Do not burden the will with what harms life,
Do not exhaust the spirit with what harms Heaven;
Act with ease, yet the spirit remains undisturbed,
Flow inwardly, yet the exterior remains unchanged;
Turn vision inward, reverse hearing,
Align with the spirit’s shifts—
Ascend with Heaven, descend with the world;
The spirit guards without disturbance,
Vital breath flows without strain,
Advance and retreat, bend and stretch—
All find the Middle Way.

---

**The Way’s Origin:**
Begin with non-action,
Move with the formless,
Manifest in timely harmony,
Thus success is naturally achieved.

---

**Returning to Transformation:**
Heaven and Earth alternate,
Thus they endure eternally;
Humans return to sleep,
Thus they attain clarity;
Flying birds return to gather,
Thus they soar high;
Running beasts return to rest,
Thus they leap far;
Dragons and serpents return to their coils,
Thus they shine resplendent;
Grasses and trees return to root,
Thus they remain verdant.

When transformation returns,
The divine attains its place,
Communing with the Void,
The soul rests, the vital breath settles,
Each finds its ease—
The will is tranquil, the breath flows smoothly,
Blood and vessels harmonize.

---

**Those Who Lose the Dao:**
Discarding constancy,
Pursuing cleverness,
Indulging desires,
Reckless action brings calamity.

Thus, wisdom invites disaster,
Clarity brings calamity,
Deep insight leads to death,
Erudition brings ruin.
Why is this so?
They do not return to the Original Beginning,
They do not restore the Root Source;
Their actions defy the Dao,
Their stillness estranges them from the Spirit.

Existing, yet they cannot preserve;
Doing, yet they cannot accomplish.

---

Cultivate the mind in emptiness and stillness,
Anchor the will in subtlety and wonder,
Abandon thought in desirelessness,
Return to action in non-action—
Thus one attains longevity,
And abides with the Dao eternally.

---

**Chapter on the Supreme Dao:**
The Supreme Dao acts without contrivance,
Yet the world knows its existence.
Next, it is cherished and praised.
Next, it is feared.
Next, it is reviled.
When trust is insufficient,
Doubt arises.
Mysterious! How precious its words!
When deeds are complete and affairs fulfilled,
The people say, *"It happened naturally."*

---

People delight in being rulers,
Calling them *"Emperors."*

---

**Chapter on Discarding Learning:**
Discarding learning brings no anxiety.
How far apart are *"only this"* and *"that"*?
How different are *"good"* and *"evil"*?
What people fear, one must not fail to fear.
Vast! Its end is boundless!

The masses rejoice and bustle,
Like feasting on the grandest sacrificial offerings,
Like ascending the Spring Terrace—
I alone remain tranquil, yet no signs appear,
Like an infant yet to be weaned,
Staggering and unsteady, as if lost.

The masses all have excess,
While I alone seem abandoned.
Am I the heart of a foolish man?
Dull and indistinct!

The common folk are bright and discerning,
I alone am dim and murky.
The common folk are keen and probing,
I alone am muddled and obscure.

Serene as the sea, yet boundless in its sweep—
How profound! How endless!

The masses all have something to grasp,
While I alone appear crude and coarse.
I alone differ from others,
Yet cherish the **Mother of All** (*Food of the Dao*).

---

**Chapter on the Perils of Worldly Learning:**
Worldly learning extols argument and values knowledge,
Fosters cliques and partisan debates.
The virtuous gain from it, the wicked suffer harm.
Within heaven and earth, the virtuous are few while the wicked are many,
Thus learning’s benefits are shallow, yet its harms are deep.

The wicked who pursue learning
Are like tigers gaining wings—
Soaring and prowling across the four seas,
Selecting flesh to devour.

The Sage discards it,
And the world rests in peace.
No teaching, yet all transform naturally;
No commands, yet all submit of their own accord.

---

**Chapter on the Dao’s Fullness Through Flexibility:**

**Chapter on the Dao’s Fullness Through Flexibility:**

What is bent remains whole,
What is warped becomes straight,
What is hollowed becomes filled,
What is worn becomes renewed,
What is few gains much,
What is much falls into confusion.
Thus the Sage embraces **Oneness**,
And serves as a model for all under heaven.

He does not flaunt himself, so he is bright;
He does not insist on being right, so his virtue shines;
He does not boast of his deeds, so his merit endures;
He does not pride himself, so he endures long.

Only by not contending does he surpass all contenders in heaven and earth.
Was it mere empty words when the ancients said,
*"What is bent remains whole"*?
Indeed, it is whole and returns to its source.

Even sages among kings and lords
Still regard it as *"bent"*—
By entrusting governance to officials,
Their virtue remains whole.

When constraints are few, gains are many—
Yet even then, things find their proper measure on their own.

To rely solely on one’s own thoughts and deliberations,
Without drawing from others,
Is to invite madness through excessive speech and knowledge.

The Sage does not pride himself in his clarity,
But lets all under heaven see with their own eyes—
Thus even **Lí Lóu** cannot surpass his vision.

*"Boasting"* means aggressive assault.
If one exploits the world’s anger to attack the world,
Even the Yellow Emperor could not rival his might.
If one harnesses the world’s strength to wage war upon it,
Even **Tang** and **Wu** could not match his achievements—
Thus all under heaven submit to him,
And the descendants of feudal lords serve him willingly.

Shadows follow form, echoes answer sound—
They do not contend with anything,
So who could contend with them?

---

**Chapter on the Virtue of Few Words:**

Few words align with the natural Way.
Hence, gusting winds do not last a morning,
Sudden rains do not last a day.
Who brings this about?
Heaven and Earth.
Even heaven and earth cannot endure long—
How much less can mortals?

Those who follow the Dao:
Those aligned with the Dao merge with the Dao,
Those aligned with virtue merge with virtue,
Those aligned with loss merge with loss.
Those who merge with the Dao find the Dao rejoices in them;
Those who merge with virtue find virtue rejoices in them;
Those who merge with loss find loss rejoices in them.
*"Trust"* is insufficient—there is *"no trust."*

---

**Chapter on the Perils of Arrogance:**

The overreaching cannot stand,
The striding cannot walk,
The self-admiring cannot see clearly,
The self-righteous cannot shine,
The self-praising achieve no merit,
The self-proud do not endure.
In the Way, they are called *"excessive food, superfluous limbs."*
Things abhor them—
Thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell among them.

---

**Chapter on the Primordial Oneness:**

There exists a **Primordial Unity**,
Born before heaven and earth,
Silent, vast—
Independent, unchanging,
Circulating without exhaustion,
Capable of being the **Mother of All under heaven**.
I do not know its name—
I call it the **Dao**.
Forced to name it, I call it **"Great."**
Great means *"passing"*—
Passing means *"distant"*—
Distant means *"returning."*
Thus the Dao is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
And the Sovereign is Great.
Within the realm, there are four Greats—
And the Sovereign holds one of them.

Humans model Earth,
Earth models Heaven,
Heaven models the Dao,
The Dao models **Naturalness**.

---

**Chapter on Lightness as the Root of Substance:**

Substance is the root of lightness,
Stillness governs agitation—
Thus the Sage, though traveling all day,
Never strays from his **carriage and baggage**.
Though adorned with splendor,
He dwells aloof—
How could one who rules a thousand chariots
Lightly cast aside the weight of all under heaven?
Lightness leads to losing one’s foundation,
Agitation leads to losing one’s master.

---
**Chapter on Knowing the Masculine:**

**Chapter on Knowing the Masculine:**

Know its **masculine** (雄),
Hold its **feminine** (雌),
And the world will be **a valley** (溪).
If the world is a valley,
His **virtue/power** (德) remains unerring,
And he returns to the state of **innocence** (婴儿).

Know its **bright** (白),
Hold its **dark** (黑),
And the world will be **transformed** (式).
If the world is transformed,
His **virtue/power** (德) will not falter,
And he returns to the **boundless** (无极).

Know its **glory** (荣),
Hold its **humiliation** (辱),
And the world will be **a natural plain** (谷).
If the world is a natural plain,
His **virtue/power** (德) will be complete,
And he returns to **Naturalness** (朴).

**Naturalness** (朴) dispersed becomes **vessels** (器),
The Sage uses it and becomes **officials and leaders** (官长).
Thus the great **mechanisms** (制) are not severed.

---

**Chapter on Knowing the Masculine (Additional Commentary):**

(71) Return to **innocence** (婴儿) is to return to **essence** (志).
In **innocence**, he is **simple and unknowing** (蠢然无而无知也).

(72) Revert to **the unborn** (未生),
Return to **the beginningless** (未始),
Align with the **Dao/Way** (道) as constant,
And return to the **boundless** (无极).

(73) **Virtue/power** (德) and **Dao/Way** (道) are **auxiliaries** (佑),
**Divine clarity** (神明) is **assistance** (助).
When **Dao/Way** (道) is complete and **virtue/power** (德) is complete,
Then all things attain **great purity and Naturalness** (大淳朴).

**Chapter on Taking the World:**

**Chapter on Taking the World:**

If one would take the world and act upon it,
I see that it cannot be done.
The world is a divine vessel—
It cannot be forced.

Those who force it ruin it;
Those who grasp it lose it.
Thus things sometimes move, sometimes follow,
Sometimes sigh, sometimes blow,
Sometimes grow strong, sometimes weak,
Sometimes falter, sometimes collapse.

Therefore, the Sage avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance,
Avoids grandeur.

---
*(74)* The world is what divine clarity creates,
What **Great Harmony** (太和) fulfills.
Divine clarity perceives it,
While the Sage’s wisdom and might cannot reach or control it.

*(75)* Excess is overdoing;
Extravagance is unbalanced;
Grandeur is overbearing.
Thus, they are discarded.

---

**Chapter on Fine Arms:**

Fine arms are an inauspicious tool.
Men detest them,
So those who follow the Way do not dwell upon them.

The gentleman, at home, values the left;
In war, values the right.
Arms are an inauspicious tool,
Not the tool of the gentleman.
Used only when unavoidable,
He holds to serenity as supreme,
Victory without pride.
To take pride in victory is to delight in killing.
He who delights in killing
Cannot achieve his aims in the world.

Auspicious matters favor the left;
Inauspicious matters favor the right.
The **Left General** takes the left,
The **Right General** takes the right—
This is to treat war as a funeral rite.
For the multitude slain, let there be mourning and weeping.
When victorious, treat it as a funeral rite.

---
*(76)* The gentleman is the ruler of the land.
To value the left is to honor life and growth.

---

**Chapter on Knowing People:**

To know others is wisdom;
To know oneself is enlightenment.
To overcome others is strength;
To overcome oneself is power.
To know contentment is wealth;
To persevere is resolve;
To remain steadfast is endurance;
To die without perishing is longevity.

---
*(77)* Not knowing others, one cannot act in the world;
Not acting in the world, one cannot engage with society.
Not knowing oneself, one cannot comprehend **Dao/Way**;
Not comprehending **Dao/Way**, one cannot foresee what is unseen.
Not overcoming others, one cannot rule;
Not ruling, one cannot be sovereign.
Not overcoming oneself, one cannot attain self-mastery;
Not attaining self-mastery, one cannot win others.
Not knowing contentment, one cannot know wealth;
Not knowing wealth, one cannot curb desire.
Not persevering, one cannot align with the **Way**;
Not aligning with the **Way**, one cannot find fulfillment.
Actions not in accord with nature—
One cannot achieve harmony;
Without harmony, one cannot long endure.
Not enduring, one cannot nurture **spirit-qi** (神精);
**Spirit-qi** not accumulated, one cannot attain longevity.

Thus, to establish oneself in the world,
To promote benefit and remove harm,
To interact with others and adapt—
Nothing surpasses knowing people.

To gather wisdom and preserve clarity,
To establish the state and nurture the people,
To embody the **Way’s** intent,
To grasp **Heaven’s** will—
Nothing is greater than self-knowledge.

To govern with authority,
To set laws and rites,
To implement measures and commands,
To rectify the realm,
To subject the feudal lords—
Nothing is more noble than overcoming others.

To uphold **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,
To align with divine clarity,
To follow **Heaven** and **Earth**,
To harmonize **yin** and **yang**,
In action and stillness, advance and retreat—
To subtly win the hearts of men—
Nothing is more exalted than self-mastery.

To govern the family and state,
To make the people content and joyful,
To dwell in propriety, reverence, and caution,
To be filial, kind, and law-abiding—
Nothing is higher than contentment.

To wander in divine clarity’s luminous realm,
Serene and undisturbed,
To attain honor, splendor, and grace—
Nothing is better than fulfillment.

To serve in office, attend to superiors,
To complete others’ works,
To follow in their footsteps,
To benefit the myriad people—
Nothing surpasses endurance.

What **Heaven** and **Earth** cherish,
What the living rely upon,
To dwell in it without satiety,
To rejoice in it without end—
When all blessings converge,
And none can rival its splendor—
Nothing is more beautiful than longevity.

---

**Chapter on Grasping the Great Image:**

Grasp the **Great Image**,
And the world will come to it.
Come to it without harm,
And it will be peaceful and vast.
Offer delight and bait,
And passing guests will stop.

When the **Way** emerges in speech,
It is bland, without flavor.
To gaze upon it, insufficient to see;
To listen, insufficient to hear;
To use it, never exhausted.

---
*(78)* The **Way** has no form,
Yet **Heaven** and **Earth** rely on it to generate.
The **Way** has no being,
Yet **yin** and **yang** rely on it to begin.
The **Way** has no law,
Yet the four seasons rely on it for their work.
The **Way** has no image,
Yet the myriad beings rely on it to move.

Thus, the **Great Law** has no law,
The **Great Image** has no image,
The **Great** has no limits to what it lacks,
The **Great** has no limits to what it possesses.
To act where there is no acting,
To negate where there is no negation—
Thus the **Way** achieves its purpose without doing,
And **virtue/power** governs without exertion.

What then is there to do?
Not lacking what is lacking,
Not negating what is negated—
The **Way** finds itself here,
And all things find themselves there.

---

*(79)* When one is about to **withdraw** it, one must first **fully expand** it;
When one is about to **weaken** it, one must first **fully strengthen** it;
When one is about to **abolish** it, one must first **fully promote** it;
When one is about to **take away** it, one must first **fully grant** it—
This is called the **subtle luminosity**.

The **soft and weak** overcome the **hard and strong**.
A fish cannot be lifted from the depths,
And the **state’s sharp tools** cannot be kept from the people.

*(80)* The **Dao/Way** that passes through **virtue/power** and **mystic luminosity**,
That **Heaven** and **Earth** transform through,
That **yin** and **yang** regulate—
The **real** returns to the **void**,
The **luminous** returns to **obscurity**,
The **flourishing** returns to **decay**,
The **expanded** returns to **relaxation**,
The **possessed** returns to **loss**,
The **alive** returns to **death**—
This is the nature of things and the **natural Way**.

Thus, the **advantage of reversal** and the **benefit of yielding**—
The **Way** governs **Heaven**,
**Heaven** governs the **sovereign**,
The **sovereign** governs the **ministers**,
The **ministers** govern the **people**,
And all **qi-bearing** kinds **preserve themselves in life**.

When **tigers and leopards** seek to grasp,
They **conceal** their claws;
When **jackals and wolves** prepare to devour,
Their **fangs** are not seen;
The **sage** abandons **intent** to follow the **Way**,
The **wise** turn against the **world** to follow the **people**.

**Loyal words** that are **displeasing to the ear** contain their **rectitude**,
And **wicked ministers** about to rise **submit** to their **lord**.

If one knows this and **applies** it,
Then between **Heaven** and **Earth**, within the **six directions**,
All shall be **blessed**.
If one does not know this and **applies** it,
Then even within the **inner chambers**, among **bone and flesh**,
All shall be **thieves**.

Thus, **children** and **brothers** may at times be **jackals and wolves**,
And **enemies** and **foes** may at times be **father and elder brother**.
Yet within **affirmation** lies **negation**,
And within **negation** lies **affirmation**—
**One negation, one affirmation**,
And **some perish while others survive**.

Thus, unless it is **loyalty**,
Even **kin** cannot be trusted;
Unless it is **goodness**,
Even the **near** cannot be **loved**.
