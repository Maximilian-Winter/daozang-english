**Volume One of the *Dao De Jing* with Commentary**
**Narrated by the Wu Commandery recluse Gu Xuan**

**Chapter 1: The Dao that Can Be Spoken of**
**Commentary:** This refers to the Dao as expounded in the *Jing* for the cultivation of political and religious teachings.

**The Dao that Cannot Be Spoken of**
**Commentary:** This is not the Dao of natural longevity and immortality.

**The True Dao** (that cannot be spoken of) is to:
- Nourish the spirit with non-action (*wúwéi*),
- Keep the people at ease without affairs (*wúshì*),
- Hold the luminous within and conceal its brilliance (*hán guāng cáng huī*),
- Erase one’s traces and obscure one’s origin (*miè jì nì duān*),—
so profound it cannot be named or described.

**Exegesis:**
The term *Dao* signifies the principle of emptiness and fluidity (*xūtōng*), while *cháng* denotes the state of profound stillness (*zhànjì*). The **Dao of the Boundless** is the innate nature (*zhèngxìng*) of all beings. When it speaks of "the Dao that can be spoken of," it refers to **named teachings**—the methods that can be articulated.

Though it may be called "the Dao that can be spoken of," one must adapt to circumstances (*suí jī qiè dàng*) and speak accordingly, yet it remains merely a manifestation of sound and discourse (*yǒu shēng yǒu shuō*), not the **true, immutable, and eternally still Dao**.

The **True Dao** transcends named teachings and cannot be grasped by thought or reasoning (*bùkě míngyán biàn*). Its subtlety is unparalleled (*miào zhuó xīyí*), its essence elusive to the point of bewilderment (*lǐ qióng huǎnghū*). Thus, only beyond the realm of words and symbols (*zhī yán xiàng zhī biǎo*) does one truly align with the **Dao of immutable stillness**.

What can be spoken of and named is the **Dao that is not the True Dao**.

**The Name that Can Be Named**
**Commentary:** This refers to the **names of wealth, honor, and worldly eminence** (*fùguì zūnróng gāoshì zhī míng*).

**The Name that Cannot Be Named**
**Commentary:** This is not the **name of natural, eternal permanence**.

The **True Name** (that cannot be named) should be like:
- The infant’s unspoken innocence (*yīngxiōng zhī wèiyán*),
- The undivided egg (*jīzǐ zhī wèifēn*),
- The pearl still within the oyster (*míngzhū zài bàng zhōng*),
- The gemstone hidden in stone (*měiyù chǔ shíwèn*),—
where its inner radiance is clear (*zhāozhāo*), yet its outer appearance is dull as ignorance (*wài rú wán yú*).

**Exegesis:**
**Name** is **teaching** (*jiào*). Earlier, the Dao that can be spoken of was expounded with utmost clarity (*shèng míng yú lǐ*). Now, the Name that can be named is a secondary revelation through teaching (*cì xiǎn yú jiào*). Since the True Dao transcends words and symbols, and even teaching surpasses mere discourse (*shuōshì*), the essence of the Dao and its teachings are **one without distinction** (*bùyī bùyì*).

Yet the **Supreme Dao** is too profound to measure (*bùkě yá liàng*), neither void nor existent (*fēiwú fēiyǒu*), neither fixed nor eternal (*bùduàn bùcháng*), yet it holds **nuanced distinctions** (*yì yǒu yìyáng*), and **teaching** accommodates both gradual and sudden methods (*jiào cún jiàndùn*). Thus, the True Dao is posited to transcend what can be named, hence the statement: *"The Dao that can be named is not the True Dao."*

When discourse reaches its utmost, it rests in **the realm of neither naming nor not naming** (*wúkě wúbùkě*). Therefore, the *Yùjīng Jing* (Jade Capital Scripture) states:
*"Neither naming nor not naming, thought merges with the subtlest essence."*

**The Nameless**
**Commentary:** The **Nameless** refers to the **Dao itself**, which has no form and thus cannot be named. **The Beginning** signifies the Dao’s emission of *qi* and manifestation of transformation (*tǔqì bùhuà*), arising from the **Void** (*xūwú*) as the primordial source of heaven and earth.

**Exegesis by Master Wang:**
Though the Dao is **Nameless**, it yet **emits *qi* and manifests transformation**, emerging from the **Void** to become the **origin of heaven, earth, and all things**.

**Exegesis:**
**The Beginning** is the **Source** (*běn*). The **Void and Nameless Dao** molds and refines all things (*táoyǒng zhōngwàn wù*), from the **Two Poles** (*èr yún*) to the **Three Manifestations** (*sān jǐng*), all deriving from it. Thus, the **Nameless** is the **root of all things**, and though it can be spoken of, its clarity is evident.

**The Named**
**Commentary:** The **Named** refers to **heaven and earth**, which possess form, position, yin and yang, and softness and hardness—these are their **Names**.

The **Mother of All Things** is heaven and earth, which contain *qi* and give birth to all things, nurturing them to growth and maturity, like a mother rearing her child.

**Exegesis:**
The **Mother** has **form and traces** (*yǒu míng jì*). The **Dao of the Profound Void** originates as the **Nameless**, yet descending from its source, names and distinctions arise. Thus, the Sage establishes the **Named** to elucidate the **Nameless**, desiring to **nurture beings back to their origin**—through compassion and care (*cíbēi jūyǎng*), akin to a mother’s role.

**Master Gu states:**
The **Named** refers to **yin and yang**, while the **Nameless** is the **True Dao**. The True Dao has no substance (*wú tǐ*), hence it is **Nameless**. Yin and yang are differentiated (*yǒu fēn*), hence they are **Named**.

**The Beginning** is taken from its **timelessness** (*wú xiān*), while **Mother** is taken from its **function** (*yǒu gōng*). Timelessness renders the origin unsearchable (*běn bùkě xún*), while function makes its principle explicable (*qí lǐ kě shuō*). For yin and yang contain *qi* and give birth to all things, nurturing them to growth and maturity—like a mother rearing her child—hence they are called **Mother**.

**Constantly without desire, one observes its subtlety.**
**Commentary:** *Miao* means **essential unity** (*yào*). When one constantly remains without desire (*wú yù*), one can perceive the **core principle** of the Great Dao.

**Essential unity** is **oneness** (*yī*), which issues forth and manifests transformation (*míng dào zàn shū*), distinguishing right and wrong (*míng shìfēi*).

**Exegesis by Jiéshuò:**
This refers to **preserving the Void** (*shǒu xūwú*).

**Exegesis:**
*Miao* means **profound and refined** (*jīngwēi*). **Observation** is **illumination and scrutiny** (*zhào chá*). **Its** refers to **oneself** (*jǐ*). When one constantly remains without desire or action (*wú yù wúwéi*), in **absolute emptiness and stillness** (*zhì xū zhì jìng*), one can then **discern the subtleties of one’s own Dao** and **perceive the refined essence of ultimate principle**.

**Constantly with desire, one observes its return.**
**Commentary:** *Jiǎo* means **alignment** (*guī*). Those who constantly harbor desire (*yǒu yù*) can observe the **tendencies of the worldly realm**.

**Master Yu states:**
Humans are born in stillness (*jīng*), which is the **nature of Heaven**. When stirred by things (*gǎn wù*), they move—this is the **desire of nature**. If one constantly upholds **purity and stillness**, releases the mind and frees the spirit (*jiěxīn shìshén*), and reflects back upon one’s true nature (*fǎn zhào zhèngxìng*), then one observes the **refined origin**.

**Exegesis:**
When one cannot remain in **non-action and serenity** (*wúwéi tiándàn*), fails to **guard the refined and uphold the true**, but instead **arises with greed and indulges in worldly attachments** (*wàngqǐ tānqiú, sìqíng rǎnzhì*), one merely sees the **existence of worldly conditions** (*shìjìng zhī yǒu*), yet does not grasp the **emptiness of immediate existence** (*jìyǒu zhī kōng*). Thus, one fails to perceive the **refined essence of the Dao** and only witnesses the **alignment toward life and death**.

Earlier, the distinction between the **Nameless and Named** was clarified; now, the **superiority of those without desire over those with desire** is revealed.

**Master Zhang states:**
The **highest attainments** (*shàng dá zhī rén*) take and discard with equanimity (*qíngyí*), maintaining **purity and emptiness without desire** (*qīngxū wúyù*). Their **spirit and emotions** are illuminated and scrutinized (*shénqíng zhào chá*), thus they attain the **subtleties of the Dao**.

**The two aspects** (of desire and non-desire) **emerge from the same source yet bear different names.**
**Commentary:** The **two aspects** refer to **those with and without desire** (*yǒu yù wúyù*). **Same source** means they both arise from **human nature** (*tóng chū rén zhī xīn*). **Different names** signifies their **distinct outcomes** (*suǒ míng gèyì*).

Those without desire endure, while those with desire perish their bodies.

**Commentary:**
The observed realm is singular, yet the observing wisdom varies—
when these two modes of perception differ, their subtleties earn distinct names.
They are called **Dao/Way** together.
**Note:** *Dao/Way* refers to **Heaven**.

It is said that those with desire and those without share the same origin in **Heaven’s qi**.

**Commentary:**
*Dao/Way* signifies depth and boundlessness, also a name for non-adherence.
With two minds—having and not having—both trace back to the same **Dao/Way**, emerging yet differing.
This differing yet singular **Dao/Way** is called **depth and boundlessness**.
The boundlessness of depth: its principle lies in non-adherence.
Neither adhering to having nor to not-having—both non-adherence—
thus it is called **Dao/Way**.
**Dao/Way**, again **Dao/Way**,
**Note:** *Heaven within Heaven.*

It is said that the reception of qi varies in thickness—
those who attain **harmony and nourishment** become sages and worthies,
while those who receive **turbulence and impurity** become greedy and licentious.

**Commentary:**
Those with desire cling only to having,
while those without desire cling to not-having—
thus, **Dao/Way** is spoken of to dispel both fixations.
Yet fearing practitioners might cling to this **Dao/Way**,
another **Dao/Way** is spoken of to remove the later affliction.
Now, not clinging to clinging nor to not-clinging—
this is dispelling again, hence **Dao/Way**, again **Dao/Way**.

**Master Gu states:**
Though all receive qi from Heaven,
humans differ in elevation, and qi in purity—
Heaven is ever higher and purer, Earth ever lower and fouler.
Those who receive pure qi become the wise and virtuous,
while those who receive impure qi become the common and foolish.
The wise and virtuous are without desire, perceiving its subtleties.
The common and foolish are with desire, perceiving only its entanglements—
this is natural.
**The Gateway to All Subtleties.**
**Note:** To know that Heaven contains Heaven within it,
that the reception of qi varies in thickness—
if one can eliminate emotions and desires,
and abide in **harmony**,
this is called the **Gateway to Knowing the Dao**.

**Commentary:**
*Gateway* is the **Law-gate**.
Earlier, with the singular **Dao/Way** of the center,
the dual fixations of the two extremes were dispelled.
Once the dual afflictions are removed,
the medicine of the center is itself dispelled—
when medicine and affliction vanish together,
this is the utmost subtlety, exhausting principle and essence.
It is not merely the doorway of all sages,
but also the **Law-gate of all subtleties**.

All under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
**Note:** *To exalt oneself, making it manifest.*

**This evil is already present.**
**Note:** There is peril and ruin.

**Commentary:**
*Heaven under Heaven* is the comprehensive name for the worldly realm. *Beauty* means delight and affection. The *Sutra of the Upper Primordial* states:
*"All beneath the heavens, all above the earth—
within them dwell beings, called the worldly realm."*
It speaks of all living creatures, none who do not cling to dusty passions, falsely arising in beauty and ugliness. What contradicts the heart gives rise to resentment—this is called *evil*. What aligns with the will inevitably breeds attachment—this is called *beauty*.
Yet unaware that all dharmas are both existent and empty, beauty and ugliness being empty, what is there to love or hate?

Thus *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The fur-lined walls and lovely consorts—
what mortals call beautiful—
fish see them and dive deep,
birds see them and take flight.
Again, the beautiful deems itself beautiful,
but I do not know its beauty.
The ugly deems itself ugly,
but I do not know its ugliness."*
By this standard, where is there beauty or ugliness?
Thus, those in the world who cling to beauty as beauty—
this is itself the root of evil.

**Gu says:**
All beings know they indulge in the beauty of sensory objects—
the five desires, sounds, colors, and all dusty passions—
and this unceasing beauty brings suffering to the body.
Thus, this evil is already present.

**This goodness is already present.**
**Note:** There is fame and status.

**This non-goodness is already present.**
**Note:** It is what people contend for.

**Commentary:**
The vulgar masses, lost in true principle,
not only indulge in lust and color
but also covet fame and reputation,
pursuing name at the cost of life,
serving self while harming others,
unaware that fame and virtue are hollow constructs.
Thus the text below asks: *Which is closer to you, name or body?*
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"To do good without seeking fame,
and again, what they prize and spare—
nothing but fame and virtue."*
Thus, it is clear that clinging to fame and virtue
contradicts true principle.
Only by forgetting good and evil and abiding in the center
does one attain the Way of *wuwei*.

**Luo says:**
All beings, receiving form,
cherish their bodies and crave fame—
what they treasure is nothing but fame and virtue.
This "goodness" without goodness
only invites suffering.
Though fame may be attained,
what benefit does it bring to oneself?

**Being and non-being generate each other.**
**Note:** Seeing being as non-being.

**Commentary:**
The two names, *being* and *non-being*,
arise interdependently.
Pursuing principle to its end,
they are both empty in essence.
Once it is known that being and non-being generate each other,
it is clear that all dharmas are without substance.

**Wang says:**
Craving desire is the mind of *having*;
emptiness and stillness are the mind of *non-being*.

**Difficulty and ease arise together.**
**Note:** Seeing difficulty as ease.

**Commentary:**
With a mind of emptiness and wisdom,
there is neither ease nor difficulty.
With discriminating attachment,
there is both ease and difficulty.
Thus, the two dharmas of difficulty and ease
mutually arise and depend on each other.

**Wang says:**
To suppress nature is difficult;
to follow desire is easy.
To suppress ease and follow difficulty is good;
to abandon difficulty and follow ease is disastrous.
Disaster and perversity manifest outwardly—
thus it is said they arise together.

**Long and short define each other.**
**Note:** Seeing shortness as length.

**Commentary:**
To measure length by length reveals no length;
to compare shortness with shortness reveals no shortness.
Thus it is said that long and short define each other.

**Wang says:**
Self is length, others are short—
each is self and not the other.

**High and low topple each other.**
**Note:** Seeing high as low.

**Commentary:**
*Topple* means to usurp.
Where there is high, there must be low;
without low, there is no high.
How so?
Compare a *chi* with a *cun*—
the *chi* becomes high,
compare a *zhang* with a *chi*—
the *chi* becomes low.
What was once high is now low—
thus it is clear that high and low have no fixed nature,
mutually usurping, all empty.

**Sounds harmonize each other.**
**Note:** When one sings above, the other must respond below.

**Commentary:**
The five tones and bamboo pipes
harmonize to form music.
Pursuing their intrinsic nature,
they are all empty in essence.
By analogy, all phenomena are likewise empty and false.

**Before and after follow each other.**
**Note:** When one moves above, the other must follow below.**

「○Commentary: When one looks back from today to the past, today exists because of the past; when one looks forward from the past to today, the past is named because of today. Yet today is not truly today—how could it give rise to the past? The past is not truly the past—how could it give rise to today? Since there is neither past nor present, what is before or after? Thus, it is known that though there are before and after, the three times follow one another yet have no ultimate substance.

○Master Wang said: Beginning and end pursue each other, never far apart—like accumulating virtue yields blessings, accumulating vice invites calamity. Good and evil act in the present, while fortune and misfortune follow in their wake.

Thus, the Sage governs through *wuwei* (non-action).
**Note:** Governance through the Dao.
**Explanation:** This means naturalness.

○Commentary: The Sage is one who embodies the Dao and aligns with the True. "Sage" also means "rectified"—able to rectify oneself and, in turn, others. Therefore, they are called Sage. This Sage, with compassion and mercy, rescues all beings, upholding the wondrous law of *wuwei* to govern the desiring masses. The governance is near—referring to the ability to govern mentioned earlier, which belongs to the Sage. Continuing from before, it states: Thus, the Sage governs through *wuwei*, being still yet active, active yet still, still yet active, and through *wuwei* yet able to act.

Active yet still—this means, in the world, not abandoning *wuwei*. Thus, *wuwei* is indeed action, and action is indeed *wuwei*. How could there be distinctions between marketplace and mountain valley, or separations between bowing in silence and governing the world? Hence, it is said to govern through *wuwei*.

Practicing the teaching of *wu* (non-speech);
**Note:** Leading by personal example.

○Commentary: The wondrous embodiment of the True Source transcends speech and form. Though dwelling in stillness, its transformations are boundless. Not only does the True not contradict response, but speech does not hinder silence. Having emerged from speech and silence, their essence is one. Silent and composed, yet filling the world with influence—how could one say the Sage "does not speak" by sealing the lips? Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: *"One who speaks sufficiently can speak all day and exhaust the Dao; one who speaks insufficiently can speak all day and exhaust things."*

All things arise,
**Note:** Each moves spontaneously.
yet without complaint.
**Note:** Not repelling or obstructing.

○Commentary: All things are all living beings. *Action* means response and movement. *Beginning* means first. The Sage, without intention, responds to stimuli—like a clear mirror or an empty valley. Responding only after being moved, not acting before things, hence *Zhuangzi* says: *"Ever harmonious yet never leading."*

Bringing forth yet not possessing,
**Note:** The Original Qi gives rise to all things yet does not possess them.
acting yet not relying,
**Note:** The Dao’s actions are not done with expectation of reward.

○Commentary: *Relying* means depending on. The great Sage, with an empty heart, seizes opportunities to benefit beings, treating self and others equally, forgetting both self and others. Though achieving great deeds, they never depend on them, forgetting their accomplishments.

When deeds are complete, they do not dwell upon them.
**Note:** When deeds are done and affairs settled, they withdraw, not claiming position.

○Commentary: Covering and nourishing all things, their deeds reach heaven and earth, illuminating the people with brilliance surpassing the sun and moon—yet they attribute their deeds to others, not dwelling in their virtue.

Only because they do not dwell upon it,
**Note:** Only because their deeds are complete and they do not claim position,
is it that it does not depart from them.
**Note:** Their blessings and virtue remain ever-present.

This speaks of the Sage’s non-action, which cannot be followed; their non-speech, which cannot be known. The previous six lines—high and low, long and short—Master Wang opens one source, from which a hundred branches arise. The transformations of these hundred branches never fail to bring chaos.

○Commentary: *Fu* marks the beginning of speech; *wei* emphasizes uniqueness. Only the Sage creates and transforms heaven and earth, nurtures all sentient beings, achieves great deeds, yet attributes them to others. Who but the Sage could do this? Because they recognize their deeds, their great deeds are ever distant, their Sage virtue ever present—thus it does not depart.

Not elevating the worthy,
**Note:** The "worthy" refers to worldly scholars—eloquent in speech, skilled in texts, yet detached from the Dao, prioritizing form over substance.

Not elevating means not honoring them with rank or office.
**Explanation:** Master Wang says: Elevating the worthy creates distinctions; following distinctions sparks contention. Thus, the people do not contend.

**Note:** Not contending over fame and position, returning to naturalness.

○Commentary: This does not mean the ruler does not value the worthy. It is that people practice humility, placing others before themselves, not exalting themselves while belittling others. Speaking of "not contending"—if everyone exalts themselves while belittling others, then vain competition flourishes. If all retreat from self and prioritize others, then contention naturally ceases.

Not treasuring difficult-to-obtain goods,
**Note:** The ruler does not hoard treasures—gold abandoned in mountains, pearls cast into abysses.

Thus, the people do not steal;
**Note:** The ruler’s purity descends, so the people have no desire for noble things.

**Explanation:** This means evil *qi* does not arise, thieves do not enter. A single firm grasp dispels evil *qi*.

○Commentary: Difficult-to-obtain goods refer to treasures like Zhao pearls and Jing jade. If treasures are universally prized, thieves will arise. If treasures are universally despised, petty thefts will not occur. Hence, it is said there is no theft.

Not seeing what is desirable,
**Note:** Banishing *Zheng* music, distancing flatterers.

**Explanation:** This means *wuwei*.

Thus, the heart does not become disordered.
**Note:** No licentiousness.

**Explanation:** Ever maintaining the One.

○Commentary: What is desirable refers to worldly sights and sounds—objects of greed and attachment. The Sage does not see them—not because they block the ears, but because the wondrous embodiment perceives the emptiness of dust and phenomena, finding no true desirable objects. Exhausting the roots of dust, they do not align, hence no desire arises. Since there are no desirable objects, the ears and eyes wander freely, yet the heart remains ever empty and still. Thus, it is said the heart does not become disordered.

Hence, the *Xisheng Jing* says: *"Like shadows in a mirror—visible yet untouchable."* It also says: *"To see is to see nothing; to listen is to hear nothing."* The previous statements on non-contention and non-theft are specific; this statement on not seeing what is desirable is comprehensive, dispelling the three activities and all phenomena. It solely reveals the Sage’s empty heart benefiting beings.

Thus, the Sage’s governance—whether of the realm or of the self—
*○节解 (Jiejie)* says: *"Of the self, it means:*
To empty the heart, to fill the belly—
*○注 (Zhù)*: *to discard cravings and dispel distractions.*
To embrace the Dao/Way and hold to the One, to preserve the Five Spirits.
*○御 (Yù)*: *The heart, undisturbed by desirable objects, is thus emptied.*

*○节解 (Jiejie)* says: *"To empty the heart is to have no wicked thoughts.*
To fill the belly is to close the qi and nurture the essence.*

*○郭 (Guō)*: *When all evil is transformed and exhausted, all virtues arise naturally.*
To embrace the Dao/Way and hold to the One is to maintain purity and harmony within—
*○疏 (Shū)*: *Having no desirable objects without, and no desiring heart within,*
The heart and its objects both forgotten—
*○疏*: *This is the state of "heart without heart."*
Though the external realm be illusory and the heart be emptied,
Yet there remains a luminous awareness—
So it is said, *"The wondrous embodiment perceives emptiness yet responds without distinction,"*
And *"virtue is full within."*
To weaken the will—
*○注 (Zhù)*: *to soften, yield, and humble oneself,*
Not to seek power or dominance.
*○御 (Yù)*: *When the heart is emptied, the will naturally weakens.*

*○疏*: *Though the inner self is filled with wisdom,*
The outer self expands to meet all beings,
In the world yet unsoiled by dust—
*○疏*: *Gentle and yielding, retreating from strife.*

To strengthen the bones—
*○注 (Zhù)*: *to cherish essence and value qi,*
So the bones are full and firm.
*○御 (Yù)*: *When the belly is filled, the bones naturally grow strong.*
*○顾 (Gù)*: *Bones rely on containing essence;*
When essence is scattered, the bones grow weak.
Preserving essence and valuing qi—
Then the bones naturally strengthen.

*○床化 (Chuáng Huà)*: *The Sage, though outwardly demonstrating harmony and brightness,*
Remains inwardly ever still and undisturbed.
To make clear that movement does not harm emptiness,
And response does not depart from truth—
Thus it is said, *"To strengthen the bones."*

Ever keep the heart in ignorance and without desire—
*○注 (Zhù)*: *returning to simplicity and guarding purity.*

**○御 says:**
*To reject contention and curb the knowing,*
*To sever greed and extinguish desire.*

**○疏:**
*Knowing* refers to the distinctions of sound and name,
*Desire* is the label for avarice and seeking.
It speaks of how the Sage, ever empty yet benefiting the people,
Turns upside-down ones away from divisive thoughts,
Quells the vulgar’s greedy cravings.
Thus, those who know dare not act.

**注:**
*Deep in thought, speaking not lightly.*

**To act without action,**
**注:**
*Not contriving, moving only in accordance with the Way.*

**Then nothing remains ungoverned.**
**注:**
*Virtue’s cultivation is pure; the people dwell in peace.*

**○疏:**
Having already abandoned desire in seeking non-desire,
Yet fearing those without desire might stagnate in empty views,
The Way of non-action is spoken of—
Yet to say *"dare not act"* is to dispel non-desire.
Fearful of clinging to this *"not acting,"*
Thus it follows with *"dare not"* as well.

*Governance* means rectification;
If one but first dispels having-desire,
Then dispels non-desire,
This is the double-dispelling of the two extremes,
The wondrous embodiment of the One Way,
Where self and other merge,
And phenomena and wisdom both vanish—
Thus governance, with nothing left unrectified.

**The Way is void yet applied,**
**注:**
*Void—this means central.*
The Way conceals itself in name, its use lies within.

*A household says:*
*The Way’s use lies in its void and harmony—*
Thus it is called *void.*

**○饰解 says:**
*Void* means *one*—
That the One abides within, ever acting.

**Or it does not overflow.**
**注:**
*Or*—always.
The Way is ever modest, never full.

**○饰解 says:**
*This means guarding stillness.*

**○疏:**
The Sage’s transformations are manifold;
No words are more fitting than *"central"*—
Thus, *"The Way is void yet applied."*
This is to take *centrality* as use,
Yet to say *"or it does not overflow"*—
Toward the One Central Way,
Breaking the two extremes,
Once the extremes are removed, the One returns to dispelment.

Now, lest those who cling to teaching
Dwell in the One Centrality,
And take it as fullness—
To say *"does not overflow"* is to dispel the meaning of *centrality.*

**Deep, like the source of all things.**
**注:**
*The Way’s depth is unfathomable—*
Like the ancestral root of all things.

**○疏:**
*Deep*—still water.
To liken the Sage’s words:
Still water can reflect people,
Sage-wisdom illuminates all dharmas—
Thus the Master Carpenter takes his measure from still water,
All beings find their ultimate in the Sage—
Yet it is called *"like"*:
To clarify that there is no fixed source,
Yet the source is sourced.

Thus *Zhuangzi* says:
*"No one mirrors in flowing water,
But all mirror in still water."*
And again:
*"Still water is clear and deep—*
The Great Teacher’s ultimate essence."*

**To blunt its sharpness,**
**注:**
*Blunt*—to halt.
*Sharp*—advancement.
When human desires are sharp and pressing,
Seeking fame and gain—
This must be halted.
The Way does not reveal itself.

**To dissolve its anger.**
**注:**
*Anger*—resentment.
One must ponder the Way’s non-action to dissolve it.

**○节解 says:**
*This means not harboring wrath.*

**○疏:**
Having already emphasized the profound practice,
Self-benefit’s Way is complete,
As the teacher for all things—
Thus below, it clarifies benefiting others.
Realizing phenomena and objects are empty,
It calms those who press forward in seeking.
Yet to say *"dissolve anger"*—
*Anger*—bitter resentment,
*Solve*—to disperse.
Anger arises from defiance and compliance,
Defiance and compliance stem from deluded mind.
The Sage penetrates the emptiness of defiance and compliance,
The non-existence of deluded mind—
Thus able to guide the people,
Leading them back to true reality,
Dispersing their grudges,
Free from hatred and delusion.

**To harmonize its light,**
**注:**
*Though possessing singular insight,*
One must blend with obscurity,
Not to confuse others with brilliance.

**○节解 says:**
*The Sage’s Way is ever to harmonize divine radiance.*

**○疏:**
*Light*—the illumination of wisdom.
The Sage’s wisdom shines like sun and moon,
Yet conceals its brilliance, hides its path,
Aligning with ordinary understanding—
Virtue subtly pervades, not dazzling things.
Thus below, it says: *"Light yet not blinding."*

**To equalize its dust.**
**注:**
*One must share the vulgar’s filth,*
*Not set oneself apart.*

**○疏:**
*Dust*—the six defiling senses of color, sound, and so on,
Like the dust of the world, which can stain both pure and impure objects.
The laws of sound and color, too, can mar virtuous conduct,
Hence they are called *dust*.

Yet *equalizing* means this:
When the Sage descends into the world,
He hides his traces and conforms to the vulgar,
Having already concealed that radiant wisdom,
He also blends with this defiling dust.
Sound and color make no distinction,
Eyes and ears are the same—
Yet he remains untouched by defilement,
This is how he differs.

Deep and tranquil, as if something exists.
I do not know whose child he is,
Yet he precedes the Divine Prototype.
Heaven and Earth are not kind,
Treating all things as mere fodder for the ox.
The Sage is not kind,
Treating the people as mere fodder for the ox.
Between Heaven and Earth—
Is it like the vast expanse of a keyhole?
Empty yet unyielding,
Moving yet ever emerging.

Many words lead to exhaustion,
Better to hold to the Center.
The Spirit of the Valley does not die,
This is called the Mysterious Mother.
The Mysterious Mother’s gate—
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Endless as if she exists,
Yet she is effortless to use.
Heaven endures, Earth lasts long—
Heaven and Earth endure so long
Because they do not generate themselves,
Thus they can everlastingly generate.

Therefore, the Sage places himself last,
Yet his actions are first;
He sets himself outside,
Yet his essence remains.
Is it not because he has no selfishness?
Thus he can fulfill his true purpose.

The highest virtue is like water:
Water benefits all things without striving,
Dwells where others abhor,
Thus it nears the Dao.
The Sage’s dwelling is virtuous,
His heart is deep like the abyss,
His conduct is benevolent,
His words are trustworthy,
His governance is effective,
His deeds are accomplished,
His actions are timely.
Only because he does not strive,
He incurs no blame.

Clutching and filling—
Better to let it be.
Prodding and sharpening—
Cannot be long preserved.
Gold and jade filling the hall,
No one can guard them.
Riches and honor lead to arrogance,
Only to invite one’s own misfortune.
When merit is complete and fame achieved,
He withdraws—
This is the Dao of Heaven.
Carrying the vital essence and embracing unity,
Can one remain unseparated?

**注:** *To focus the qi and attain softness,*
**注:** *To focus the mind and close the breath,*
So that it does not scatter,
Then the body can respond with pliability.

**能如婴儿乎？**
**注:** *Can one be like an infant?*
**注:** *Can one be as pure as an infant?*
**注:** *Can one be without inner thought or outer affairs,*
Then the spirit will not depart.

**○节解曰:** *This speaks of embracing the Original Qi without exertion.*
*The Great Dao flows freely,*
*Like an infant’s innocence.*

**○御曰:** *To be like an infant—*
*Is to make no distinctions.*

**○张曰:** *To focus the mind—*
*This is the breath of the Central Void, harmonized.*
**○张曰:** *To focus the mind is to be one.*
*Qi*—the breath of life.
*Attain*—to grasp.
*Softness*—harmony.
*Infant*—the cessation of knowledge and perception.

The breath moves eastward and life begins,
The breath scatters and death ensues.
Humans must focus the mind and cherish the breath,
Attaining the Way of softness and harmony,
Only then can they internally still the divisions,
Externally sever the knowledge of the Dao,
So that the body is not seen as the body,
And the body itself is extinguished.
The heart does not know the heart,
And the heart itself is serene,
Hence it is said: *Can one be like an infant?*

**○疏:** *Focus*—the mind’s essence.
*Qi*—the Dao’s breath.
*Attain*—to grasp.
*Softness*—harmony.

**政**—*virtue/power attained.*
**柔**—*harmony.*

It is only through focusing the mind on the Dao’s *qi* and attaining the principle of softness and harmony that one becomes like an infant, free from desire.

*Purify and inspect the Mysterious Vision*—
*Note: Wash the heart to make it pure and clear.*
The heart dwells in the Mysterious Void, inspecting all things—hence it is called *Mysterious Vision*.
Can one be without blemish?
*Note: Free from licentiousness and vice.*

**○疏:**
*Purify*—to wash.
*Except*—to dispel.
*Inspect*—to examine.
*Blemish*—disease.
To purge the Six Palaces and dispel the Five Emotions, so that the spirit-*qi* becomes empty and mysterious, one can then examine subtle principles. Internally and externally, pure and tranquil, without blemish or disease.

Then the body does nothing, the heart takes nothing,
Neither clinging to life nor rejecting annihilation.
Using this, how could there be blemish or disease?
This is the clarity of self-benefit.

*Love the people and govern the state*—
*Note: To govern the body, cherish the breath to preserve the spirit; to govern the state, love the people to ensure its stability.*

Can one be without action?
*Note: For governing the body, inhale and refine the vital *qi*, ensuring no sound is heard.
For governing the state, dispense virtue and benevolence, ensuring none below discern it.*

**○疏:**
Having already expounded the Dao of self-benefit, now one must turn to interacting with others. The first step in interacting is to govern the state and love the people.
*Know*—discriminating wisdom.
Compassion and pity, nurturing the people—this is loving the people.
Dispensing governance and cultivating transformation—this is governing the state.
The ruler must be sincere and unadorned, teaching the Way of non-action, blocking deceit and closing the path of discrimination. Thus, the *strike-the-clod* harmony may be achieved, and the *knotted-cord* governance may be restored.
The following text states: *"To govern the state is to eliminate its bandits, not to use wisdom to cultivate its virtue."*

*Illuminated and all-reaching*—
*Note: The Dao is illuminated like the sun and moon, reaching all four directions and filling the world. Beyond the eight extremes, it is unseen and unheard, yet radiant in all ten directions, dazzling and brilliant.*

Can one be without knowing?
*Note: None can know the Dao’s fulfillment across the world.*

**○节解:**
*Four-reaching*—knowing the eight directions.
Close the heart and block thoughts, enduring eternally.
If you can practice this, you will attain communion with the Ancient Sovereigns.

**○疏:**
*Illuminated*—capable of illumination.
*White*—pure and unadorned.
*Four*—the four directions.
*Reaching*—unobstructed.
The Sage’s emptiness and wisdom are illuminated, subtly penetrating profound principles, with no knowledge left unilluminated and no realm left unpenetrated. Thus, mentioning the four directions suffices to clarify the eight extremes.
Moreover, in stillness yet able to respond, this is the four-reaching.
Response does not contradict stillness—constantly abiding in non-action.

**○蔡:**
*Four-reaching*—recognizing body, life, and wealth.
*Without knowing*—the heart holds no discrimination.

*The Heavenly Gate opens and shuts*—
*Note: The Heavenly Gate refers to the Northern Pole’s Purple Micro mansion.
Opening and shutting refer to the five critical junctures of beginning and end.*
For governing the body, the Heavenly Gate is the nostrils—opening is panting, shutting is breathing.
**○王:**
Heaven has the Northern Pole star within the Purple Micro mansion, where the Five Virtues’ sovereigns successively reign. Thus, the Gate has opening and shutting.
Shutting is *Negation*, opening is *Prosperity*.
Spring sees the Green Sovereign’s Gate open, while the others shut—this applies to the three seasons.
The five critical junctures refer to the rise and fall of the Five Virtues, their cyclical succession. Each era has opening and shutting, each succession has *Negation* and *Prosperity*.
The Sage abides within this, ever guarding the receptive and tranquil, thus not swayed by the shifts of beginning and end.
For governing the body, the Heavenly Gate is the nostrils and mouth—opening is panting, shutting is breathing.
Cultivating life and guiding the people, the breath’s inhalation and exhalation must not be heard. Ever able to remain receptive and tranquil, one naturally attains the Way of non-action.

Can one be receptive?
*Note: Governing the body should be like the receptive female—tranquil, soft, and weak.
Governing the state should respond to changes, harmonious yet not leading.*

**○疏:**
The *Riverbank Master*’s text reads *Heaven and Earth*.
Heaven and Earth’s opening and shutting refer to the rise and fall of cosmic cycles.
The Sage blends into the two poles, unaffected by the three calamities. Though cycles rise and fall, the heart remains eternally empty and tranquil. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says:
*"When the great flood submerged Heaven, I did not drown.
When the great drought made metal flow and earth mountains wither, I did not feel the heat."*

*Nurture and raise*—
*Note: The Dao gives birth to all things and nurtures them.*

*Give birth yet not possess*—
*Note: The Dao gives birth to all things, taking nothing for itself.*

**○郭:**
*Yīnyūn* merging and transforming, all things arise.
Displaying benevolence while concealing action—this is the trace of *having-for-doing*, yet the merit is not claimed, hence *"not possessing."*

**○疏:**
The Sage, having benefited themselves through the Dao, fills others with virtue, thus able to give birth and nurture all sentient beings. Hence, the following text states:
*"The Dao gives birth to them, virtue nurtures them, and things shape them.
Though molding all things and refining the Three Talents, the true body remains empty—thus no living beings can be transformed."*

*Act yet not rely*—
*Note: The Dao’s actions are not relied upon for reward.*

**○疏:**
Since there are no living beings left to transform, acts of benefiting others are without expectation of gratitude.

*Nourish yet not dominate*—
*Note: The Dao nourishes all things, yet does not carve or control them for use.*

**○疏:**
*Dominate*—to rule.
The Sage nourishes all beings, truly their transformative sovereign, yet forgets merit and abandons the self—hence *"not dominate."*

**○顾:**
The Dao nourishes yet does not dominate; the Sage dominates yet does not sever.
Perfecting all things, truly the transformative sovereign, yet forgetting merit and abandoning the self—hence *"not dominate."*

This is called *Mysterious Virtue*.
*Note: The virtue is profound and inscrutable, unseen, meant to make the heart align with the Dao.*

**○张:**
*Mysterious*—deep and distant.
*Virtue*—the highest virtue.
Praising this self-forgetting Sage, obscured in transformation, truly profound and the highest virtue.

**Mysterious Virtue is also Heaven**—
*Heaven* is the Dao in its profound and boundless form.
It acts yet does not cling—
*It performs its function without attachment.*
This aligning with Heaven is called *virtue*.
*Note: The Sage’s virtue harmonizes with the Dao’s boundless nature.*

**○疏:**
*Mysterious*—deep and distant.
*Virtue*—the highest virtue.
Praising this self-forgetting Sage, obscured in transformation, truly profound and the highest virtue.

**Thirty spokes unite at a single hub**—
*Note: In ancient times, a chariot had thirty spokes, corresponding to the thirty days of a month.*

The hub has a hollow core—
*Hence, all spokes converge upon it.*
For governing the body, one must purge emotions and desires,
*Thus emptying the five viscera,*
So that the spirit may return to it.
For governing the realm, one must wield few abilities to command the many,
And use weakness to support strength.

**○严、顾等曰:**
Ancient chariots symbolized the thirty days of the month—
*The moon hangs in the sky, flowing without rest,*
While the chariot wheels upon the earth—
*Yet also carries without ceasing.*
Thus, ancient chariots were made to emulate the moon.
Thirty spokes unite at a single hub—
*Just as thirty days complete one month,*
So too do the many spokes depend on the one hub,
Illustrating how all teachings, though diverse,
Converge upon a single principle.
This one principle, though few in form,
Encompasses all teachings.
For governing the realm,
*When many opinions arise, the wise follow the few;*
Using weakness to support strength,
*Hence, the single hub—few in number—*
Commands the many spokes.

**○疏:**
The *Zhou Li·Kao Gong Ji* states:
*"Thirty spokes represent the thirty days,
Thus completing one month."*
When it is *without*—
*The hub’s core is empty,*
Hence it can bear the weight of all beings.
Moreover, the chariot is but a borrowed name for the myriad greens—
*The harmonized earth,*
Which, though dismantled and examined,
Reveals an illusion of form.
All the more so for every law—
*They too are thus.*
When it is *without*—
*There arises the chariot’s function.*
*Note: "Without" means emptiness; the hub’s emptiness allows the wheels to turn, the carriage’s emptiness permits the conveyance of people.*

**Molded clay becomes a vessel**—
*Note: "Molded" (涎) means harmonized; "clay" (坛) refers to earth.*
Harmonized earth serves as a vessel for food and drink.
When it is *without*—
*There arises the vessel’s function.*
*Note: The vessel’s emptiness allows it to contain and receive.*

**○节解曰:**
This refers to how ancient people shaped clay vessels without firing them—
*If exposed to water, they would crumble,*
And thus fail as vessels.
If one seeks the Dao yet relies on worldly methods—
*Entering chambers to refine the form at set times—*
Then one is a commoner, bound to perish.

**○疏:**
The *Kao Gong* says:
*"Molded" (涎)—harmonized.
"Filled" (填)—adhered.*
Harmonized water and clay, fired to form a vessel,
*Its emptiness within allows it to contain and receive.*
All the more so for the Sage’s empty heart—
*Thus able to embrace all things.*

**○张曰:**
Earth has the nature of a vessel;
*Harmonized, it becomes a vessel.*
Man has the nature of the Dao;
*Cultivated, he becomes the Dao.*

**Pierce doors and windows to make a chamber**—
*Note: Refers to constructing houses.*
When it is *without*—
*There arises the chamber’s function.*
*Note: Doors and windows are empty spaces,*
Through which people may enter and exit,
And within which they may dwell—
This is its function.*

**○疏:**
Piercing and carving doors and windows to make houses,
*The chamber’s emptiness allows habitation.*
All the more so for the Sage’s empty heart—
*Thus able to embrace all things.*
Piercing doors and windows,
*They permit passage and exchange,*
And all the more so for the empty, permeable roots and orifices—
*Hence, their use without obstruction.*

The three things—chariot, vessel, chamber—
*Their meanings are analogous,*
Yet they are repeated because:
*The chariot moves yet does not rest,*
The chamber rests yet does not move,
*The vessel both moves and rests—*
These three distinctions,
*Hence their repetition.*

**Thus, the "having" brings benefit**—
*Note: Things profit the form; vessels contain objects, chambers hold people, lest they be destroyed. The spirit dwells within the abdomen, lest the form perish.*
**○节解曰:**
This refers to the Dao.
The "without" brings function.

The annotation states:
*"The empty void can be used to contain and receive all things—*
*Thus it is said: 'The empty and formless can govern the formed.'*
*The Dao is the empty void.*

○ *Node Interpretation says:*
*'This refers to the Sage’s adherence to Oneness, acting naturally, and employing nothing.'*

○ *Exegesis:*
*'The "having" relies on the "without" for benefit,*
*The "without" depends on the "having" for function—*
*These two principles interdependently form the chariot and such.*
*The Sage must rely on both the "having" and the "empty,"*
*Using the empty to guide the having,*
*The having and empty mutually supporting,*
*Lest the heart incline to excess,*
*Thus achieving the Sage’s benefit and utility.*

○ *Master Gu says:*
*'Benefit (利) means advantage.*
*Within the chariot’s hub is the axle,*
*Within the vessel is food,*
*Within the chamber is a person,*
*Within the body is the spirit—*
*All these are things that bring advantage,*
*Hence it is said: "The 'having' brings benefit."*

*Yet the spirit’s advantage to the body,*
*The "having" within the "without,"*
*The "having" itself is invisible,*
*Thus it returns to the "without."*

*The spirit is the advantage for sustaining life,*
*The void is the means for nurturing the spirit.*
*This clarifies that the Dao is neither "having" nor "without,"*
*The "without" achieves function,*
*The "having" brings benefit to things.*
*Benefit to things lies in the "having,"*
*Function lies in the "without."*

*The "without" is clarity and emptiness,*
*The "having" is spirit and luminosity—*
*Yet common scholars fail to grasp this,*
*All following Laozi’s doctrine of complete non-action.*

*If the Dao were entirely non-action,*
*How could it benefit things?*
*Now it is clear that the Dao’s benefit lies in*
*Using form for advantage,*
*The "without" for function,*
*Thus containing all things through emptiness.*

#*End of Volume One of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Exegesis*
#*Original text missing; restored from common editions.*

「#2 **Qi/Godly Spirit***: Originally written as *shēn* (a variant of *shén*), corrected to *shén* (Godly Spirit), based on the Tang Dynasty Emperor Xuanzong’s imperial annotation of the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Exegesis* from the Daoist Canon.

**Volume Two of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Exegesis**
*Narrated by the Wuyun recluse Gu Xuan*

Five colors blind the eyes,
*[Note:]* Indulgence in lustful desires and vibrant hues consumes vital essence, dims clarity, and prevents one from perceiving the formless *color*—thus, the eyes grow blind.

**[Node Solution]:** It does not mean the eyes are physically blind, but that one’s own vision is obscured. Though they see only the *xuányuán* (the primal yellow of the cosmos) and the *jūyù* (jade-like radiance of the Dao), the brilliance of the Godly Spirit is lost, and the five colors’ dazzling glare obscures all else—so the eyes are blind.

**[Exegesis]:** The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black.
It states that one cannot internally illuminate the true source of existence, yet externally pursues fleeting sensory realms. Though they see the illusory colors of the world, they remain unaware of the formless *color*—so what difference is there between blindness and this?

Five tones deafen the ears,
*[Note:]* Delight in the five tones scatters harmonious *qi*, preventing one from hearing the soundless *sound*—thus, the ears grow deaf.

**[Node Solution]:** It does not mean the ears are physically deaf, but that one’s own hearing is dulled. Though they hear only the clamor of bells and drums, they fail to perceive the Godly Spirit’s voice—so it is called deafness of the ears.

**[Exegesis]:** The five tones are *gōng* (yellow bell), *shāng* (major second), *jué* (minor third), *zhǐ* (major fourth), and *yǔ* (major fifth).
When the mind indulges in strings and pipes, the ears become clogged by the five tones, unable to return and listen to the subtle *sound* of the Dao—so it is called deafness.

*Zhuangzi* says: It is not only the body that has blindness and deafness, but the mind as well.

**[Wang Bi’s Commentary]:** If one is ensnared by them, then licentious sounds will harm the Godly Spirit and disrupt the true nature. When one’s speech is filled with lamentation and sorrow, it is the same as being deaf.

**[Gu Xuan and Shi Le’s Commentary]:** Though they hear only discordant clamor, it is still called not being deaf—yet they fail to recognize that the true nature of sound is emptiness, and thus are no different from the deaf.

Five flavors make the mouth insensible,
*[Note:]* *Shuāng* (insensible) is the same as *wáng* (lost).
Indulgence in the five flavors leads to reckless speech, straying from the Dao.

**[Exegesis]:** The five flavors are sweet, bitter, sour, pungent, and salty.
*Shuāng* means deviation and loss. When one indulges in rich delicacies and savors the rank, they cannot taste the Dao’s essence or discuss its mysteries—so it is called insensibility of the mouth.

Those who indulge in reckless pursuits and hunting,
Their minds grow deranged.

*[Note:]* The human spirit prefers tranquility; if one gallops and breathes wildly, the spirit scatters and dissipates—so the mind grows deranged.

**[Node Solution]:** It refers to the dead returning to the earth, their kin lamenting in sorrow, while the living rush about in haste, weeping and wailing. The departed are buried in tombs, the living scatter in the fields, the close kin are deranged with grief, the distant kin are sorrowful—so it is said that their minds grow deranged.

**[Imperial Annotation]:** Those who chase after worldly affairs, clinging to artificial actions, like hunters who seek only to slay, wage daily battles with their minds, racing after sensory realms—when they pause to reflect, they are struck by madness.

**[Exegesis]:** *Chíchéng* (reckless pursuits) is akin to *zǒuzòu* (rushing about). Hunters, driven by greed, chase after beasts, their hearts wild and unrestrained—like madmen. Those who invert the Dao’s principles, their desires chase after sensory realms, swift as galloping steeds, their minds as deranged as hunters.

Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: There are five ways to lose one’s true nature—one of which is when the five colors blind the eyes, preventing them from seeing clearly.

Hard-to-obtain treasures bring hindrance to one’s conduct.
*[Note:]* *Fáng* (hindrance) is the same as *shāng* (harm).
Hard-to-obtain treasures—such as the *Zhào Bì* (Bi of Zhao) and *Suí Zhū* (Pearl of Suí), precious gold, silver, jade, and pearls—when one’s heart covets them and their mind desires them without knowing contentment, then their conduct brings harm to their body and disgrace to their name.

**[Exegesis]:** Fine and beautiful things, when one clings to and indulges in them, become the cause of birth and death. Within the path of cultivating the Dao, they greatly obstruct progress.
Thus, the Sage holds to the *fù* (abdomen),
*[Note:]* Guarding the five *xìng* (nature/essence), eliminating the six *qíng* (emotions), moderating the *zhìqì* (intentional *qi*), and nurturing the Godly Spirit.

And does not indulge the eyes,
*[Note:]* The eyes should not gaze wantonly, for wanton gazing scatters vital essence outward.

**[Exegesis]:** Thus, following the previous text—
The Sage embodies the sacred precepts: whatever is within the abdomen, whatever is external to the eyes, they embrace the Dao and cultivate its *virtue/power*, filling their inner being. Therefore, they hold to the abdomen.
Internally, they perceive the formless *color*; they return to listen to the soundless *sound*. All sensory faculties are empty and pure, untouched by dusty realms—so they do not indulge the eyes.

Thus, they abandon the former and take the latter.
*[Note:]* Abandoning the eyes’ wanton gazing, taking the abdomen’s nurturing of the Godly Spirit.

**[Exegesis]:** Abandoning the ears and eyes’ blindness and deafness, taking the abdomen’s true wisdom.

Favor and disgrace are like sudden alarm,
*[Note:]* Both receiving honor and enduring humiliation bring alarm.

**[Imperial Annotation]:** When one clings to them, they are filled with dread; when one is bound by them, they are filled with sorrow. Not having set their minds to honor or disgrace, they are both alarming.

**[Exegesis]:** Favor refers to the name of glory and love; disgrace refers to the shame of punishment. *Ruò* (like) means *as*; *jīng* (alarm) means *fear*.
When one receives favor, they grow idle and joyful; when one suffers disgrace, they are startled and troubled in spirit—so receiving favor fills the heart with alarming joy, while enduring disgrace fills the heart with alarming dread.
Though joy and fear differ, they are both forms of alarm—so it is said that they are like alarm.

Yet the emotions of joy and fear are not the true nature—so those who attain the Dao liken poverty and wealth to the cold and heat of the seasons, compare honor and disgrace to the coming and going of fortune, and remain unshaken by death and life—what then is the power of honor and disgrace to alarm them?

Great misfortune is like the body itself.
*[Note:]* *Guì* (great) means *fear*; *ruò* (like) means *until*.
One fears great misfortune until it reaches the body—so it is alarming.

**[Exegesis]:** Great refers to noble rank, but also to one who forgets their body in their own nobility. It refers to afflictions such as worries, old age, and illness.
Common people only know to boast of their own bodies, yet fear great misfortune—unaware that great misfortune is their very body. They seek nourishment and sustenance, yet ultimately return to decay and ruin. So to fear the body is to fear great misfortune, and to fear great misfortune is to fear the body—both are rooted in the body itself.

**[Cai’s Commentary]:** Those who cling to the body are attached to their own form, unable to let go or forget. They worry over their body’s labor, fear its hunger and cold, and ponder its decay—this is great misfortune. Thus, it is known that clinging to existence brings suffering, and preserving the body is the root of all misfortune. Those who fear their own body are no different from those who fear great misfortune.»

Thus the *Xi Sheng Jing* says:
*"The body is the root of affliction—pain, itch, cold, and heat—
the origin of great misfortune, arising from clinging to the body."*

What is meant by *honor and disgrace*?
**Note:** *Honor* refers to exaltation and dignity; *disgrace* refers to shame upon the body.
This is a self-directed inquiry to awaken understanding in others.

Honor is lowly,
**Note:** *Honor and disgrace* are both base.
To gain it is like a shock,
**Note:** Those who gain honor in shock—
like one in high station fearing peril—
noble yet dare not be arrogant, wealthy yet dare not be extravagant.
To lose it is like a shock.
**Note:** *Loss* means losing favor and suffering disgrace.
*Shock* means fearing that calamity will return.

**Jie’s Explanation:** It means that when one attains the Dao, all spirits gather within the abdomen, murmuring and conversing with one’s children—knowing that the five spirits and vital *qi* flow freely, hence *"to gain it is like a shock."* To lose it is like a shock means that when *qi* is lost and essence depleted, the spirits stagnate and one part fails—hair turns white, teeth fall out, and death comes, while mourners wail and call the soul from the roof, shocked by the heavenly spirits—hence *"to lose it is like a shock."*

**Cushion:** The world is inverted, valuing honor as supreme, while wisdom sees it as base. Why? Because gaining honor brings startled joy, losing it brings startled dread—both shocks stem from the same *honor*, hence it is lowly.

This is called *"honor and disgrace as shock."*

**Note:** Explaining *"to gain it is like a shock, to lose it is like a shock."*

**Yu’s Commentary:** Honor and disgrace cycle—honor is the root of disgrace.
Ordinary minds are deluded, shocked by disgrace yet not by honor.

What is meant by *"fearing great misfortune as the body"*?
**Note:** Returning to self-inquiry—why fear great misfortune as the body?
My great misfortune arises because I have a body.
**Note:** My great misfortune comes from having a body—
to labor over it, to fear hunger and cold,
to indulge emotions and desires—
thus inviting calamity.

**Cushion:** This answers the prior question.
Clinging to the body, unable to forget it,
worrying over its labor, its hunger, its cold—
this is great misfortune.
Thus, those who prize the body are no different from those who prize misfortune.

Hence the *Xi Sheng Jing* says:
*"The body is the root of affliction—pain, itch, cold, and heat—
I am bound by the body, knowing it as great misfortune—
this is its reality.*
When I have no body, what misfortune do I have?
**Note:** If I have no body, attaining the Dao naturally,
lightly ascending to the clouds, entering and exiting without hindrance,
communing with the Dao and spirits—
what misfortune could there be?

**Yu’s Commentary:** If one knows that heaven and earth harmonize without being mine,
detaching from form and discarding intellect,
realizing the body is not the body,
uniting with the Great Way—
what misfortune could there be?

**Jie’s Explanation:** Forgetting the body to nourish the spirit is called *"no body."*

**Cushion:** *"No"* here means *sitting-forgetfulness*, losing the self,
enjoying the body while detached from form—
thus the body has no body,
not annihilation but transcendence.

Thus, those who prize the body as the world’s master
may temporarily rely on the world,
**Note:** Those who exalt their body while belittling others,
desiring to rule the world,
can establish themselves but not endure.
**Cushion:** Unaware that the body is great misfortune,
they cling to it, exalting themselves,
always seeking to dominate others—
such people may briefly dwell in the world
but cannot long govern it.

Those who love the body as the world’s master
may truly entrust themselves to the world.
**Note:** Those who love their body not for themselves
but as parents to all people—
if a ruler governs with this virtue,
they may entrust their body to the people above,
enduring without blame.

**Cushion:** *Rely* means temporary dwelling;
*entrust* means enduring commitment—
speaking of preserving and cherishing the body without reckless indulgence.
With humility to govern oneself,
yielding and following others,
they may transform and entrust themselves to the world—
hence the *De Jing* says: *"Love yourself but do not exalt yourself."*

That which cannot be seen is called *yi*,
**Note:** *Yi*—without color—
speaking of absolute uniformity,
unable to be perceived by sight.
**Cushion:** *Yi* means level—
the Dao’s subtlety cannot be grasped by the five colors,
hence it cannot be seen.
If it had color, it would be uneven—
only without color is it perfectly level.

That which cannot be heard is called *xi*,
**Note:** *Xi*—without sound—
speaking of absolute silence,
unable to be perceived by hearing.
**Cushion:** *Xi* means sparse—
its essence is not the five tones,
hence it cannot be heard by the ear.

That which cannot be grasped is called *wei*.
**Note:** *Wei*—without form—
speaking of absolute formlessness,
unable to be held or touched.
**Yu’s Commentary:** *Wei* means subtle.
The Dao has no shape, hence cannot be grasped.
Yet within its formlessness, it manifests—
thus it is called *wei*.

**Cushion:** *Wei* means subtle—
its essence is not material,
hence cannot be touched or held.

**Zang’s Commentary:** When speaking of *yi, xi, wei*,
it refers to *jing, shen,* and *qi*—
*jing* is the name for luminous wisdom,
*shen* is the name for unfathomable function,
*qi* is the name for form and appearance—
these three are unified as one.

The Sage does not see this *jing*,
does not hear this *shen*,
does not grasp this *qi*.
Since it cannot be seen, heard, or grasped,
it should be called *without color, without sound, without form*—
yet why speak of *yi, xi, wei*?

The Supreme Dao, though called *without color*,
is not utterly nonexistent—
if utterly nonexistent, it would be like the Great Void,
leading to nihilistic views.
Now it is clarified:
*Without color yet colored*,
*without sound yet sounding*,
*without form yet forming*—
hence it is called *yi, xi, wei*.

The so-called **Three-in-One**—
these three cannot be defined or explained.
**Annotation:** The three refer to *yi, xi, wei*.

That which cannot be defined or explained is *without color, without sound, without form*,
words cannot describe it,
script cannot transmit it—
one must **receive it in stillness**,
**seek it with the Dao/Way**,
it cannot be forced through definition or inquiry to be obtained.
Hence, they are merged as one.
**Annotation:** *Hun* means "to blend" or "to unite."
Thus, they are united in three names yet one.

**Exegesis:** When true and responsive, it scatters one as three;
when responsive and true, it blends three into one—
one and three, three and one, are not different,
hence it cannot be defined.

**Further Explanation:** This true and responsive duality manifests as the Three Vehicles,
the meaning of which is fully expounded in the *Opening Topic Scroll*.

Its uppermost aspect is **unfading**,
**Annotation:** Saying one exists in the heavens above,
yet its radiance is not **glittering and bright**.

Its lowermost aspect is **unobscured**,
**Annotation:** Saying one exists in the mortal realm below,
yet it is not **darkened and clouded**,
illustrating the Dao’s infinite reach above and below.
**Exegesis:** The Supreme Dao is subtle and profound,
neither foolish nor wise—
ascending beyond the Three Pure Ones,
it does not **augment its clarity**,
descending into the Nine Abysses,
it does not **add to its darkness**,
as it is said: **"neither increasing nor diminishing"**,
is this not so?

**Endless and nameless**,
**Annotation:** *Shéngshéng* means "endless motion."
That which is nameless is not a single hue—
it cannot be distinguished as **blue, yellow, red, white, or black**;
not a single sound—
it cannot be heard as **the six tones** (官商角征羽);
not a single form—
it cannot be measured by **length, shortness, size, or smallness**.

**Exegesis:** The Dao penetrates into the skin, flesh, bones, and joints,
hence it is said: **endless and nameless**.

Returning again to **the Great Void**,
**Annotation:** *Wu* means "substance" or "essence."
It must be returned to **that which lacks essence**.

**Exegesis:** *Shéngshéng* means "rectitude," akin to the meaning of *string and ink*.
The Sage, though able to **self-rectify**,
can also **rectify others**,
thus the endless and nameless cannot be grasped by name or sought by logic,
hence it is nameless.

**Further Explanation:** *Shéngshéng* depicts **motion and transformation**,
saying the Supreme Dao **turns and transforms** heaven and earth,
**molds and nurtures** living beings,
yet sight and hearing cannot trace it—
hence it is nameless.

Returning again means **reverting to the source**,
the Great Void is the **wondrous origin**.
When responding to circumstances and descending to guide,
it becomes **visible and audible**;
when reverting to its root origin,
it is **without name or form**.
Hence, it is said: **returning again to the Great Void**.

This is called **the form of the formless**,
**Annotation:** Saying one lacks shape and form,
yet it can **give shape and form to all things**.

This is called **the image of the substance-less**,
**Annotation:** Saying one lacks material essence,
yet it can **establish forms and appearances for all things**.

**Exegesis:** The wondrous origin is subtle and profound,
hence called **the formless**.
It leaves no trace of substance,
yet can **generate all things**,
hence it is called **the form of the formless** and **the image of the substance-less**.

This is called **dim and indistinct**,
**Annotation:** Saying one is **dimly present and indistinctly absent**,
neither fully here nor fully gone—
it cannot be described.

**Exegesis:** The Dao is **not fixed in existence or nonexistence**,
response is not **fixed in absence or presence**,
neither absent nor present,
yet **absent yet present**,
its presence and absence are indeterminate—
hence it is called **dim and indistinct**.

When **welcomed**, it is **not seen in its beginning**,
**Annotation:** One lacks **start and end**,
and **cannot be anticipated**.

「When one discards emotions and renounces desires,
one returns to the self—**the Way of Oneness** with one’s true nature.
**Annotation:** The *Dao* is the **form without substance**,
saying it is **comprehensible in appearance yet not in reality**,
for though it lacks material form, it manifests in response to all things.
If one were to say it **has** form, its shape is unseen;
if one were to say it **lacks** form, all things arise from it.

**Master Gu** says: Its coming is **unforeseen**,
suddenly present yet **unseen in its beginning**—
hence the saying, **"when welcomed, one does not see its start."**

**Annotation:** It is **neither fixed in ancient nonexistence nor in modern termination**;
**Annotation:** The Dao is **not ancient without beginning**,
nor is it **modern without end**.
One follows it and **finds no trace**—
it cannot be seen.
**Master Gu** says: The Dao **has no beginning**,
hence when welcomed, one does not see its start.
The Dao **has no end**,
hence when followed, one does not see its conclusion.
**Annotation:** The Dao is **not modern without end**;
**Annotation:** **Master Gu** says: Its departure **leaves no trace**,
mixed and boundless.

The **Sage holds the ancient Dao**,
to **govern all things in the present**.
**Annotation:** The Sage **clasps the ancient Dao**,
**the Way of Non-action**, to **govern the present world of action**—
thus returning to **primordial simplicity and purity**.
**Annotation:** *Exegesis*: **"Holds"** means **"preserves."**
The Sage **preserves the Dao of the Great Ancient**,
**the Way without name**, and **refines the present age**.
**Master Gu** says: Though ancient and modern differ,
the Dao remains **constant and enduring**.
Only those who **grasp it** can **govern all things**.
To **know the ancient beginning** is called **the Dao’s framework**.
**Annotation:** When one **knows the Dao of the Upper Ancient**,
**the beginning of the Way without name**,
this is called **grasping the fundamental principles of the Dao**.

**Annotation:** The ancient beginning is **the Way without name**;
if one knows **the beginningless and endless Dao**,
yet **both beginning and ending**—
neither ancient nor modern,
yet **both ancient and modern**—
and **applies the ancient Dao** to **govern the present world**,
one may truly be said to **grasp the Dao’s fundamental framework**.
**Master Gu** says: The Sage **preserves the ancient Dao of Non-action**,
**governing the present world of action**,
**calming the restless customs of the age**,
and **returning to the ancient simplicity and purity**.
**Refining and tempering** the transformations—
this is **attaining the Dao’s framework**.

In the ancient times, those who **excelled in the Way of the Sage**,
**Annotation:** Referring to **the Sage who governs the Way**;
**Annotation:** *Exegesis*: **"Ancient"** means **"of old,"**
**"excelled"** means **wise and virtuous**,
**"for"** means **to cultivate and study**.
The previous chapter **clarified holding the ancient to govern the present**,
and this **applies governing the present to draw upon the ancient**,
hence **citing those of old who cultivated the Way with wisdom**,
to **establish a model for the Sage**.

**Subtle and profound**, **penetrating the Mysterious**,
**deep beyond recognition**.
**Annotation:** The **virtue and power of the Dao** are **profound and distant**,
unable to be **known or discerned**—
**inner vision is blind**, **reversed hearing is deaf**,
none know **its extent**.
**Master Gu** says: **"For"** means **"affairs"**;
speaking of those in ancient times who **excelled in taking the Dao as their affairs**,
**even in slight and subtle words**,
the **profound and refined Dao** is **unfailingly discerned and illuminated**,
yet its **virtue and power are deep and vast**,
beyond recognition.
**Annotation:** *Exegesis*: **"Subtle and profound"** is **the wisdom that enables cultivation**,
**"penetrating the Mysterious"** is **the realm of what is cultivated**—
when **wisdom and realm converge**,
both **become profound**,
and **cannot be known by the mind alone**—
hence the admiration.

For **only what cannot be recognized** is **worthy of being described**.
**Annotation:** Referring to the following sentence;
**Master Gu** says: **Only the virtue and power of the Dao are difficult to recognize**,
hence **forcefully describing its appearance** to make it clear.
**Annotation:** *Exegesis*: **"Appearance"** means **form and semblance**;
**this Sage-wisdom, which cannot be recognized**, is **most worthy of guiding all things**—
yet **desiring to draw near and include all beings**,
one **forcefully describes the formless principle** as **the appearance of cultivation**.

**Cautious as winter crossing a river**,
**Annotation:** When undertaking any matter, one must **add weight and caution**—
**cautious as winter crossing a river**,
for the **heart finds it difficult**.
**The *Xiang Er*** says: **"Cautious"** is **like hesitation**,
**the bearing of movement and stillness**—
**always should one stand in awe**.
Winter crossing a river is **fearful**;
**to fear the four neighbors**,
**daring not to act wrongly**,
**for fear they know**—
this is how **those who follow the Dao and honor its precepts** **show humility**.

**Annotation:** *Exegesis*: **"Hesitation"** is **fear**;
speaking of **those cultivating the Dao**,
**fearing the world’s conditions**,
like **crossing a river in winter’s ice**,
**the heart trembles in dread**,
**fearing to sink**—
this **illustrates the purity of intent and deeds**.

**Like fearing the four neighbors**,
**Annotation:** Their **advance and retreat are hesitant and constrained**,
as if **one commits a crime**,
**fearing the four neighbors know**—
this **illustrates the purity of speech**.
**Master Gu** says: The **four neighbors** are **birth, death, old age, and sickness**,
also **the four demons**—
when one **does not uphold precepts**,
**delights in violating the law**,
the **four demons record it**,
hence one **must be cautious**,
**as if fearing others’ knowledge**—
**still and quiet**.

**Solemn as a guest**,
**Annotation:** Like a **guest facing the host**,
**solemn and without contrivance**.

「○Exegesis: *Yǎn* is the appearance of **dignity and solemnity**.
The *Records of Ritual* states: **"Solemn as though in contemplation"**, meaning the **sage** should **restrain and invigorate** the body and mind,
**not indulging in laxity**,
as if a **guest facing the host**,
**unable to be frivolous**—
this **illustrates the purity of bodily conduct**.

○Master Gù says: It is the **appearance of reverence and restraint**,
speaking of the **sage’s reverence and restraint**,
**doing nothing artificial**,
like a **guest before the host**,
**not daring to be careless**,
always **harmonious without clamor**.

**Dissipated like ice about to thaw**,
○Exegesis: *Huàn* means **dispersion**, *shì* means **extinction**.
It refers to **removing emotions and desires**,
**daily emptiness and voidness**.

○Master Yù says: Though **one is solemn as a guest**,
**doing nothing contrived**,
yet **not clinging to things**,
so **dissipated like spring ice melting**.

○Exegesis: As in **prior cultivation of wisdom and clarity**,
**delusions and stains disperse**,
like **winter ice encountering spring**.

○Master Sōng Líng says: Though **externally dignified as others**,
**internally ever harmonious and unrestrained**,
**no longer clinging or stagnant**,
**dissipated like frozen ice melting**.

**Sincere as uncarved wood**,
○Exegesis: *Dūn* means **genuine and thick**,
*Pǔ* means **formless and unadorned**—
**internally preserving spirit**,
**externally without ornament**.

○Exegesis: *Dūn* is **sincerity and depth**,
*Pǔ* is **plainness and simplicity**—
since the **three conducts** are **pure and cold**,
**delusions and burdens removed**,
one’s **virtue and actions become sincere and harmonious**,
**discarding superficiality for reality**.

**Vast as a valley**,
○Exegesis: *Kuàng* means **broad and spacious**,
*Gǔ* means **emptiness and void**—
**without moral reputation**,
**all-embracing and inclusive**.

○Exegesis: When **dust and burdens are exhausted**,
**the mind is pure and empty**,
so the **Dao is broad and vast**, encompassing like a valley.

**Mixed as turbid water**.
○Exegesis: *Hún* means **preserving the true nature**,
*Zhuó* means **not manifesting clearly**.
With the **crowd in uniformity**,
**not self-exalting**.

○Master Yù says: **"Blending brilliance and obscuring traces"**,
like **turbid water yet clear**.

○Exegesis: *Hún* is **unity**,
*Hé* is **maintenance**,
*Zhuó* is **artificiality**.
Though **the mind is pure and unadorned**,
**obstacles and burdens long dissipated**,
yet **in the midst of turbid confusion and artificiality**,
**it does not differ from dust and filth**.
**Turbid water, when still, gradually clears**.

○Exegesis: *Xú* means **gradual**.
Though **dwelling in desire’s midst**,
**engaged in worldly affairs**,
yet **untainted by defilement**,
**the heart ever tranquil**,
**leisurely and clear**.
**Though in motion, it remains still**—
this **illustrates stillness amid activity**.

○Master Gù says: *Zhuó* is the **appearance of dullness**,
meaning **one obscures wisdom and brilliance**,
**not allowing scrutiny**,
like **turbid water**,
**reflecting nothing**.

○Master Wáng says: **Hiding luminosity and concealing radiance**,
**externally indistinguishable from others**,
**mixed like waves and dust**—
thus it is said **"like turbid water"**.

**All seven matters above**,
are the **virtues of the ruler**.
The *Transmission* says: **"The ruler bears defilement—this is the Way of Heaven."**
**Rulers who attain the Dao** are thus referred.

If **discussing conduct in the world**,
*Hún* means **harmonizing with the crowd**,
*Zhuó* means **artificiality**.
Though **the heart is pure and simple**,
yet **in the midst of confusion and artificiality**,
**it does not differ from dust**.
As for **"turbid water, when still, gradually clears"**,
it **illustrates the heart**—
**when the heart is disturbed, cut off from its roots**,
**gradually it becomes pure and correct**.
**Tranquility endured long**,
**motion arises slowly**.

○Exegesis: **Who can endure tranquility long**,
**gradually prolonging life**?
Though **tranquil**, yet **stillness and motion intertwine**,
though **responding to things in motion**,
**the heart remains ever leisurely and transforming**—
this **illustrates stillness amid activity**.

○Master Wáng says: **When waves are mixed, turbidity arises**,
**when stillness is gradual, clarity emerges**,
**when agitation is extreme, death follows**,
**when tranquility is enduring, life sustains**.
**The wise know turbidity can be cleared**,
so **they harmonize with the waves** and then **transform**,
**they grasp danger’s potential for safety**,
so **they move gradually** to **nurture life**—
**none but those who embody the Dao’s good transformation** can thus be.
Thus it is said **"Who can?"**.
**Life and transformation are subtle and profound**,
**not achieved quickly**,
requiring **the heart’s singular focus**,
**accumulated diligence over time**,
**not seeking it daily and attaining it**—
thus **"gradual emergence"**.

**Those who preserve this Dao**,
**do not desire excess**.
○Exegesis: **Preserve** this **gradual emergence of life**,
**not desiring luxury, extravagance, or overflow**.

○Exegesis: *Bǎo* means **to uphold**.
Speaking of **those who uphold the unified Dao of stillness and activity**,
**they do not dwell in the middle while full and replete**—
this is **the Way of the Middle**.

**Only those who do not overflow**,
can **endure decay without renewal**.
○Exegesis: *Bì* means **to hide one’s brilliance**.
*Xīn chéng* means **precious and renowned**.
**Alone, the sages of the Middle Way**,
**within the decayed and turbid**,
yet **able to compassionately save all beings**,
**accomplishing great virtue**—
this is **the repeated completion**.

○Master Lú says: This **further explains the prior meaning of gradual clarity**,
**harmonizing with the worldly** and then **attaining stillness**,
**gradually preserving its clarity**,
**settling oneself** and then **responding in motion**,
**gradually ensuring life’s fullness**.

**Attaining emptiness’s utmost**,
○Exegesis: *Zhì* means **to reach**.
**Those who cultivate the Dao**,
**abandoning emotions and desires**,
**the five internal organs pure and still**,
**reach emptiness’s utmost**.

○Master Lú says: **Eliminating concerns and deliberations**,
**attaining emptiness’s utmost**.
Yet **the heart remains ever still**,
**steadfast in guarding tranquility**.

**Steadfast in guarding tranquility**.
○Exegesis: **Guarding purity and stillness**,
**conducting with sincerity and depth**.

○Master Lú says: **Emptiness’s utmost is the Dao’s fruition**.
*Dǔ* is **the Middle**.
Speaking of **those who wish to attain the Dao’s profound and empty fruition**,
must **still the heart**,
**guard the Middle Way’s singular path**—
then **it may be obtained**.

**All things arise together**,
○Exegesis: *Zuò* means **to generate**.
**All things generate together**.
**I observe them and see their return**,
○Exegesis: **I speak of observing all things**,
**none failing to return to their roots**—
**one should ponder deeply the importance of their origin**.

○Commentary: *Zuò* means **the dynamic function**—
**speaking of all sentient beings**,
**all engaging in taking and discarding**,
**chasing after external objects with greed**,
**yet the Sage’s profound insight sees them all returning to the wondrous root**—
**though in motion, they are still**.

○Master Gù says: **The still observation of their return to True Nature**.

○Master Wáng says: **The essence of perpetual generation**,
**its nature inherently serene**—
**yet when it receives and contains form**,
**the Six Emotions stir externally**,
**speaking and acting as they will**,
**reckless deeds invite calamity**.
**The Perfect One observes its original nature**,
**knowing it can be transformed and restored**—
**thus it is said: *‘I observe their return.’***

**All things flourish in abundance**,
○Commentary: *Yún-yún* means **luxuriant growth**—
**each returns to its root**.
○Commentary: **Speaking of how all things**,
**though withering and falling**,
**each returns to its root and regenerates**.

○Commentary: *Yún-yún* is **the appearance of multitude**—
**Speaking of why sentient beings cannot align with the Sage**,
**though moving without motion**,
**acting without intent**,
**it is only because they are ever driven by restless striving**.
**If one can return to the root and origin**,
**then it aligns with the Sage’s illumination**—
**this is the exhortation**.

**Returning to the root is stillness**,
○Commentary: *Stillness* refers to **the root**—
**serene, yielding, humble, and lowly**,
**thus it does not perish again**.

○Commentary: **Only by returning to the origin**,
**does the restless striving cease**.

○Master Gù says: **Grasses and trees wither and fall**,
**returning to the root is stillness**,
**humans and things transform**,
**returning to True Nature is tranquility**.
**This is called *‘restoring the Mandate.’***

○Commentary: **Speaking of tranquility**,
**it is restoring the true nature and wisdom-life**,
**having cast aside the clamor of dust**,
**the heart and spirit concentrated in stillness**,
**thus returning to True Nature**,
**restoring the wisdom-life**.

**Restoring the Mandate is constant**,
○Commentary: **Restoring the Mandate to prevent death**,
**is the Dao’s eternal practice**.

○Commentary: **Returning to the nature and Mandate**,
**doubtlessly concentrated and serene**,
**no longer subject to birth and death**,
**thus it is called *‘constant.’***

○Master Hé Yàn says: **Restoring the Mandate should make one immortal**,
**this is the Dao’s eternal principle**.

○Master Lú says: **Those who understand the constant principle of restoring the Mandate**,
**are those who see the Dao’s clarity**.

**Knowing the constant is clarity**,
○Commentary: **Those who know the Dao’s eternal practice**,
**are called *‘clear.’***

○Master Yù says: **Guarding stillness and restoring the Mandate**,
**can be called *‘constant.’***
**Those who know how to guard the constant**,
**are even more clearly enlightened**.

○Commentary: **Having known the principle of returning to the true and constant**,
**wisdom illuminates, revealing nothing hidden**.

○Master Wáng says: **The constant Dao is difficult to know**,
**thus knowing it is called *‘clarity.’***
**Not knowing the constant, reckless action brings misfortune**.

○Commentary: **Not knowing the Dao’s eternal practice**,
**while fabricating deceitful schemes**,
**loses one’s divine insight**—
**thus misfortune**.

○Commentary: **Not knowing how to cultivate the nature**,
**return to virtue**,
**and align with the true and constant Dao**,
**then one constantly arises with delusive thoughts**,
**creates karma in response to phenomena**,
**moving toward the path of death**—
**all actions bring misfortune**.

○Master Gù says: **Not knowing**—
**speaking of knowing yet acting recklessly**,
**those who act recklessly lose the Dao**—
**thus misfortune**.

○Master Sūn says: **Unable to guard stillness**,
**the Heavenly Mandate loses its constancy**—
**this is the source of misfortune**.

**Knowing the constant is tolerance**,
○Commentary: **Those who know the Dao’s eternal practice**,
**can abandon passions and desires**,
**embracing all without exclusion**.

○Master Yù says: **Knowing the true and constant Dao**,
**one must utterly attain emptiness and stillness**,
**like a boundless valley**,
**containing all without limit**.

○Commentary: **The body attains the concentrated constancy of the Middle Way**,
**awakening to the dual emptiness of conformity and deviation**,
**thus able to contain all things**.

**Tolerance is impartiality**,
○Commentary: *Impartiality*—**equitable and just**,
**since one contains all things without partiality**,
**no evil can withstand it**.

○Master Yù says: **Embracing all things impartially**,
**responding to all things without bias**,
**since there is no private malice**,
**thus it is impartial and just**.

○Commentary: *Impartiality*—**equitable and upright**.
**Since one contains all things**,
**thus it is impartial and just without favor**.

**Impartiality is sovereignty**,
○Commentary: **Impartial and just without bias**,
**one can rule the world**,
**rectifying the body makes the form unified**,
**the spirit myriad**—
**together harmonizing within oneself**.

○Master Yù says: **If one is impartial and just without bias**,
**all things will turn toward them**.

○Commentary: *Sovereignty*—**to be followed**.
**Only by containing all things**,
**being impartial and just without bias**,
**can one establish the great law**,
**becoming the refuge for all living beings**.

**Sovereignty is Heaven**,
○Commentary: **Having become the sovereign ruler**,
**transforming all things**,
**one covers and nurtures all sentient beings**,
**aligning with the boundless sky**.

**Heaven is the Dao**,
○Commentary: **Having aligned with the great law**,
**covering all things equally**,
**and mirroring the Dao’s boundless transformation**.

**The Dao is longevity**,
○Commentary: **Aligning with the Dao**,
**equal in measure to the boundless void**,
**no coming, no going**,
**the heart merging with the supreme Dao**,
**neither extinction nor generation**—
**since this aligns with the principle**,
**it is said to be *‘longevity.’***

**Longevity means no peril in death**,
○Commentary: **Death**—**extinction**.
**Peril**—**danger**.
**Having attained sovereignty and impartiality**,
**harmonizing with Heaven and the Dao**,
**the four virtues complete**,
**virtue and the Way vast and enduring**,
**no calamity, no blame**,
**dying with Heaven and Earth**,
**yet never in danger**.

「Hiding the origin and erasing the traces,
is called *‘segmenting the body’*。
○Commentary: **Responding to sensations and seizing opportunities**,
is called *‘no peril’*.
○Further Explanation: **Traces** have rise and fall,
thus *‘segmenting the body’*—**the body itself is extinguished**,
since there is originally no birth or death,
thus *‘no peril’* also.

**The Supreme Sovereign**,
the lower knows of His existence;
○Commentary: **The Supreme Sovereign** refers to the nameless Lord of primordial antiquity.
The lower knows of His existence—**the lower knows there is a Sovereign above**,
yet sees no trace of his subjects’ service,
pure and unadorned in simplicity.
○Exalted Explication: **The Supreme Sovereign** is the ancient, pure Lord.
The lower knows—**his subjects know a Sovereign exists above**,
revering him like Heaven,
yet without the traces of deliberate governance and action,
thus the people lack virtue yet still honor him.
○Commentary: **This Supreme Sovereign** is the present **Lord of the Dao of the Mysterious Heaven** in the **Jade Capital** above.
The **Lord of the Dao** abides in the **Golden Gate** within,
concentrating his spirit in distant contemplation,
as the constant place of response.
Those of keen insight,
with clear and sensitive faculties,
awaken to the wondrous, primordial stillness,
transcending form and name,
descending from the origin to manifest traces,
thus he bears titles,
yet does not cling to the illusory generation of forms,
hence the lower knows of his existence—
they know of the **Supreme Sovereign’s** title by origin.

**The next level**, they are close to him and praise him;
○Commentary: **His virtue is visible**, his benevolence and favors can be spoken of,
thus they are close and praise him.
○Exalted Explication: **When virtue is pure yet declining**,
the Sovereign governs with good teachings,
his kindness is seen, hence they are close to him,
his achievements are high, hence they praise him.
○Commentary: **Those of moderate insight**,
with somewhat dull faculties,
cannot forget words to attain principles,
must cling to forms and study methodically,
thus they immerse themselves in scriptures and teachings,
cling to what is close and praise what is apparent,
generating interpretations from texts and shared conventions.
○Reflection: **This is the age of antiquity’s middle phase**,
growing distant from the Dao,
fixating on words and clinging to forms—
its virtue is still visible.
When they are close and praise above,
then below they trust and believe in him,
below then praises and honors him above—
his deeds can be spoken of,
thus songs of joy resound on the roads.

**The next level**, they fear him;
○Commentary: **He establishes forms and laws to govern them**.
○Exalted Explication: **When virtue further declines**,
the Sovereign rules with many flaws,
the people cannot bear his commands,
thus he drives them with punishments and retribution,
hence they fear him.
○Reflection: **Those of dull faculties**,
with hearts deceived by illusions,
cannot discern clearly,
thus they mock and slander.
○Commentary: **Mockery**—**deception**.
Those of low faculties,
with dull and coarse natures,
indulge their hearts in chasing sensory objects,
their entanglements deepen daily.
They only fear worldly authority and punishments,
not the underworld’s scrutiny and judgment,
thus they mock and slander the sacred words,
destroying faith and disbelief—
hence the scripture says: *‘The lower hear the Dao and laugh at it.’*

When trust is insufficient,
○Commentary: **The Sovereign’s trust is insufficient toward the lower**,
the lower then has deceitful and cunning people.
○Exalted Explication: **The Sovereign’s trust is insufficient toward the lower**,
the lower then responds with disbelief,
and deceives their Sovereign.
○Reflection: **Those who fear and mock him**,
all stem from the Sovereign’s insufficient trust,
thus the lower has people who do not believe.

○Commentary: **It is because their faculties are low and their obstacles heavy**,
their trust in the Dao is insufficient,
thus they doubt and slander the sacred texts,
incurring the crime of disbelief.

**Yet they still value words**,
○Commentary: **Speaking of the Supreme Sovereign’s governance**,
his actions are still held in higher regard than words,
fearing he may stray from the Dao and lose naturalness**.

○Commentary: **They still value worldly, superficial, and false words**,
thus they do not believe in the Dao’s true and authentic teachings,
hence their confusion deepens daily,
and their crimes and obstacles grow ever greater.

When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
○Commentary: **This means the world is at great peace**.
The people say *‘it is natural for me.’*
○Exalted Explication: **When deeds are done yet not grasped**,
affairs fulfilled yet without action,
the people use them daily without knowing,
saying *‘it is natural that I have accomplished and fulfilled them.’*

○Commentary: **When the functions of punishment and relief are fulfilled**,
the nurturing of life and affairs is complete,
yet the supreme virtue subtly permeates,
success not claimed—
the people use them daily without knowing,
all say *‘it is natural that I have attained such things,’*
unaware of the sacred grace bestowed.

○Reflection: **Transformation does not come through words**,
the silent merit subtly covers all,
each thing roams freely,
beating earthenware in self-awakened joy,
using them daily without knowing,
rejoicing in reliance without master,
unaware of who has wrought this—
thus they all say *‘it is natural for me.’*

When the **Great Dao is abandoned**,
**there arises benevolence and righteousness**.
○Commentary: **In the age of the Great Dao**,
each family has filial children,
each household has loyal and trustworthy people—
benevolence and righteousness are unseen.
When the **Great Dao is abandoned and not practiced**,
evil and rebellious deeds arise together,
then **benevolence and righteousness** can be transmitted as the **Dao**.

○Exalted Explication: **When purity is diluted and simplicity dispersed**,
the **Great Dao does not prevail**,
daily **benevolence and righteousness** emerge,
small achievements arise and are completed,
yet **purity is diluted, simplicity dispersed**,
elaborate flaws spring from deliberate action.

○Commentary: **This is the abandonment of the ancient teachings**.
Speaking of the **Great Dao’s** age,
the five virtues are not manifest,
**benevolence and righteousness** arise,
**purity and simplicity** then decay—
hence *Zhuangzi* says:
*‘Dispersing virtue and the Dao to create benevolence and righteousness is the fault of the sages.’*
And again:
*‘They rely on one another to moisten, they support one another with oil—
it is not as good as forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes.’*

When wisdom emerges,
**there arises great falsehood**.
○Commentary: **The wise Sovereign**,
devalues virtue while valuing words,
devalues substance while valuing ornament—
the lower then responds by creating **great falsehood and deceit**.

○Exalted Explication: **Using wisdom**,
he will establish laws.
When laws emerge, deceit arises,
thus there is **great falsehood**.

○Commentary: **Wisdom**—**sacred wisdom**.
The upper uses **sacred wisdom** to govern things,
laws and decrees multiply,
the lower then employs countless deceits to evade the net of punishments,
stealing **sacred wisdom** to fashion false instruments—
the harm of wisdom is fully shown in *Zhuangzi’s* texts.

○Reflection: **In the age of the Great Dao**,
there is no knowledge, no desire,
all things cherish virtue,
external use unseen—
when the Dao’s merit ceases,
deceit then flourishes.
Wielding wisdom startles the dull,
displaying talent moves the common,
**purity disperses, simplicity departs**,
deceitful emotions arise together—
thus it is said: **great falsehood**.

「When the six bonds of kinship are fractured,
**filial piety and benevolence** arise.
**Explication:** The six bonds of kinship severed,
then relatives and kin fall out of harmony,
and thus **filial piety and benevolence** emerge to nurture one another.

○**御 (Yu) says:** All stem from losing the Dao,
so there are **partial names** in its place.

○**疏 (Shu) says:** The six bonds of kinship—
father and son, brothers, husband and wife.
In a world of **purity and harmony**,
partial affection is not evident.
When the six bonds fall into disorder,
**filial piety and benevolence** then stand out,
hence in the age when Zhou’s **virtue/power** declined,
**Jiao (浇, King Jie of Xia)** arose in competition,
and **Zeng Min (曾闵, Zeng and Min)** were praised for their lofty conduct.

When a state is in chaos,
**loyal ministers** appear.
**Explication:** When laws and decrees fail,
superior and inferior blame each other,
evil factions vie for power,
and thus **loyal ministers** arise to rectify their ruler.

This is to say:
In the age of the **Great Dao**,
there is no knowledge of **ren (仁)** and **yi (义)**—
people are naturally without desire for propriety,
yet they remain inherently clean;
no need for **zheng (贞, integrity)**,
yet they are naturally upright;
no need for **zhong (忠, loyalty)**,
yet they keep their word.

In the **Great Dao’s** time,
**ren (仁)** and **yi (义)** vanish,
**filial piety and benevolence** fade away—
just as at noon, when the sun is brightest,
all stars lose their luster.

○**疏 (Shu) says:** The sovereign of myriad chariots,
holding the four seas as his home,
thus when a state is only well-governed,
loyalty and sincerity remain unseen.
In times of chaos,
**upright integrity** then shines forth—
hence **Long Feng (龙逢)** was renowned for his loyalty under **King Jie of Xia (夏桀)**,
and **Bi Gan (比干)** was praised for his virtue under **King Zhou of Shang (殷纣)**.

**Discarding sacred wisdom**,
**Explication:** Discarding the **sacred wisdom** of rulers,
returning to the original, guarding the root—
the Five Emperors (五帝) drew symbols,
**Cang Jie (仓颉)** created writing,
yet this was not as good as the Three Sovereigns (三皇) using knotted cords without script.

**Abandoning cleverness**,
**Explication:** Abandoning **cleverness**,
returning to **non-action (无为)**.
The people’s benefits multiply a hundredfold;
**Explication:** Agriculture prospers,
public affairs are without private gain.

○**御 (Yu) says:** Discarding the **sacred wisdom** of rulers,
then their teachings fade away,
and **transformation (化)** is smooth without contrivance.
Abandoning the **common folk’s** cunning and deceitful schemes,
people return to **purity and simplicity**.
When people return to **purity and simplicity**,
artifice does not arise,
**self-aggrandizement and partiality** cease.
People in harmony with **Heaven’s Dao**,
things lose no part of their nature—
thus there is **a hundredfold increase in benefits**.

○**疏 (Shu) says:** Discarding the **sacred wisdom** of named sages,
abandoning discriminating cleverness,
people all return to their roots,
their benefits become boundless—
*a hundredfold* is but an approximation of the great number.
Hence *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Rui’s wine was thin, yet Han Dan (邯郸) was besieged—
when sages arise, great thieves appear."*
And again:
*"Tian Chengzi (田成子) stole a kingdom using sacred wisdom."*

**Discarding ren and abandoning yi**,
**Explication:** Discarding **ren (仁)**’s display of favor,
abandoning **yi (义)**’s emphasis on empty words—
the people return to **filial piety and benevolence**;
**Explication:** **Virtue/power**’s transformation is pure.

○**御 (Yu) says:** Discarding **ren (仁)** as universal love,
abandoning **yi (义)**’s rejection of material gain,
then people return to **great filial piety and benevolence**.

○**疏 (Shu) says:** Discarding **ren (仁)**’s partial inclinations,
abandoning **yi (义)**’s rigid adherence to forms,
people all follow their true nature,
without artificiality or pretension.
**Filial piety** springs from **Heaven’s natural order**,
**benevolence** flows from spontaneous virtue—
returning to **purity and simplicity of antiquity**,
hence it is said the people **return to their original state**.
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"Ren and yi are the decayed huts and straw dogs of former kings."*
And again:
*"If you eliminate Zeng and Shi’s (曾史) conduct,
the world will all be ren."*

**Discarding cleverness and abandoning profit**,
**Explication:** Discarding clever deceit,
sealing the path of greed,
closing the door to power struggles—
thieves and robbers will not exist;
**Explication:** When the upper echelons are fair and just,
the lower levels have no private or evil schemes.

○**御 (Yu) says:** If one **boasts of partial skill**,
there will inevitably be **contention for profit**,
thus discarding cleverness means people no longer contend,
abandoning profit means people find self-sufficiency.
When self-sufficient, they will not become thieves.

○**疏 (Shu) says:** Discarding **cleverness** from divergent paths,
abandoning **profit-seeking**,
each thing guards its proper measure—
thus there is no theft or robbery.
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"If a carpenter spits on his fingers,
the world will all be clever."*

These three cases,
**Explication:** Referring to the three matters above
that should be discarded.

The text is insufficient in its teachings.
**Explication:** It is insufficient because the teachings cannot guide the people.

○**Shu says:** These three matters refer to the three prior absolutions. This text is a sudden teaching of the Great Vehicle, the study of the superior ones, whose principles are profound and distant, insufficient to instruct those of lower capacity. Therefore, it is ordered to have its proper associations.

**Explication:** As in the following sentence.

○**Yu says:** These three matters merely require abandonment; they do not yet demonstrate practice. Thus, it is said that this text is insufficient for instruction, and further associations are ordered—referring to the following passages.

○**Shu says:** *Association* means to entrust. The people of lower capacity cannot yet bear the Great Vehicle’s teachings, so they must first have associations to arouse their learning. The associated text is the four lines below:

Seeing simplicity, embracing sincerity,
**Explication:** *Seeing simplicity* means to see and guard simplicity, not to adorn with artifice.

*Embracing sincerity* means to embrace one’s natural simplicity and demonstrate it to the world, so it may be emulated.

Few in private,
**Explication:** To be upright and without self-interest.

Few in desires,
**Explication:** To know contentment.

○**Shu says:** *Seeing simplicity*—rejecting ornamentation. *Embracing sincerity*—returning to reality. *Few in private*—uprightness and justice. *Few in desires*—quelling greed.

Abandoning learning,
**Explication:** Abandoning learning that is not true or does not conform to the Dao’s teachings.

Without worry.
**Explication:** Removing superficiality, then there is no worry or trouble.

○**Jie Jie says:** This means abandoning all scriptures and returning to the One.

○**Yu says:** Abandoning the learning of contrivance, then one becomes pure and simple.

○**Shu says:** *Worry*—trouble. Abandoning the learning of relative forms, one attains the principle of non-action, and thus troubles are exhausted, so there is no worry.

How far apart are *yes* and *ah*?
**Explication:** Both are responses, yet how far apart they are—criticizing the times for valuing superficiality and demeaning substance.

○**Shu says:** *Yes*—respectful assent. *Ah*—a lazy response. The *Records of Rites* says: When the teacher summons, do not answer. *How far apart*—not distant, but people do not understand the distinction between compliance and defiance, recklessly generating joy or anger. Hearing *yes* brings joy; hearing *ah* brings disdain, unaware that *yes* and *ah* issue from the same mouth, not far apart.

How far apart are good and evil?
**Explication:** *Good* is praise, *evil* is slander—how different are they? The times detest the loyal and upright, favoring deceitful flatterers.

○**Shu says:** Conforming to desire is good; opposing the heart is evil. Since compliance and defiance are both empty, beauty and ugliness are meaningless. Moreover, *yes* and *ah* arise from one mouth, while good and evil stem from one heart. Those who forget know they are not distinct; those who cling are divided like the liver and gall. Yet those entangled in contrivance are many, and within the distinctions of right and wrong, within the *yes* and *ah*, lies the root of all troubles. To abandon them is to have no worry—these two pairs briefly illustrate what must be abandoned in the learning of attachment.

What people fear,
**Explication:** *People*—the Daoist practitioner. What they fear is fearing not to abandon learning in rulers.

Cannot but fear.
**Explication:** Nearby are those who kill the virtuous through flattery.

○**Shu says:** This is what the practitioner fears—life and death, and all worldly entanglements.

**Explication:** They will surely perish. Earlier, it was ordered to abandon evil, showing that beauty and ugliness are both empty, lest one become attached to this text and be stained by worldly affairs. Hence, this sentence is issued as a warning.

How vast and endless it is!
**Explication:** The people of the world are chaotic and unrestrained, desiring to study but clinging to false teachings, with no end.

○**Shu says:** The *River Above* text reads *vast*, while others say *wild and boundless*—a distant, dim vastness. *Endless*—lamenting that it does not cease. The hearts of sentient beings are deeply entangled for a long time, their attachments firm, with no time of rest.

All people are exultant,
**Explication:** *Exultant*—indulgent in lust and desire.

Like feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
**Explication:** Like a starving man craving the finest sacrificial meats, never satisfied.

Like ascending a terrace in spring.
**Explication:** In spring, yin and yang interact, and all things respond. Ascending a terrace to gaze upon it, one’s desires are unrestrained.

○**Shu says:** Many are entangled, hence *all people*—another term for *sentient beings*. *Exultant*—joy and delight. *Feasting*—banqueting. *Grandest sacrifice*—ox, sheep, and pig. Sentient beings delight in sounds and colors, their attachments extreme, like a starving man feasting on the finest sacrificial meats, finding such joy, or like ascending a terrace in spring, gazing upon forests and fields, finding their hearts fully at ease.

I alone am serene, with no signs yet.
**Explication:** I alone am serene and tranquil, with no traces of desire.

○**Shu says:** *I*—the Old Master’s self-reference. *Serene*—stillness. *Signs*—manifestation. The Sage, though in the world, has a still and serene mind, untouched by the surroundings, with no inclination toward green hills.

Like an infant before it smiles.
**Explication:** Like a child before it can laugh at others.

○**Yu says:** I alone am serene and tranquil, with no traces of desire, like that infant before it can laugh.

Towering yet without destination.
**Explication:** Towering like a remote village, with nowhere to go.

○**Yu says:** The Perfect One has no mind; movement follows things, taking and giving nothing. Like a traveler with no destination.

○**Shu says:** *Infant*—the uncarved block. *Smile*—laughter. *Towering*—vastness. *Destination*—movement. The Sage acts without deviating from stillness, remains untouched in defilement, like that infant before it can laugh, its form and mind both still. Its wisdom is vast and respectful, its capacity boundless—like an empty boat with no mooring.

All people have excess,
**Explication:** People have excess wealth for luxury, excess intelligence for deceit.

I alone seem abandoned—
**Explication:** I alone appear cast aside, as if insufficient.

○**Shu:** The multitude clings to possession, thus indulging in excess. The Sage’s wisdom embodies emptiness, thus abandoned and untaken.

I hold the heart of the simple fool—
**Explication:** I do not follow the ways of the world, steadfast in the One, unmoved, like the heart of the simple fool.

Pure and undivided—
**Explication:** Without distinction.

○**Shu:** Pure and undivided—unmixed. The Sage’s wisdom is empty and clear, pure and refined, like the simple fool’s heart, undivided.

The vulgar shine brightly—
**Explication:** Bright and discerning.

I alone seem dim—
**Explication:** As if obscured.

○**Yu:** I conceal myself.
○**Shu:** The vulgar’s hearts are dim yet sharp in distinction, boasting their cleverness. The Sage’s wisdom is empty yet luminous, bright as sun and moon, yet veiled—thus seeming dim.

The vulgar are keen and hasty—

The vulgar are keen and hasty—
**Explication:** They are quick and sharp in discernment.

○**Yu:** Establishing laws and institutions.

I alone am **mènmèn**—
**Explication:** Without cutting off or restricting.

○**Shu:** Keen and hasty, this is the heart of distinction. **Mènmèn** is broad and unhurried, the wisdom of undivided discernment. Though the vulgar’s hearts are dull in perception, they cling to judging right and wrong, recklessly hastening in urgency. The Sage’s wisdom perceives form yet transcends it, knows emptiness and illusion, ever abiding in stillness.

Like the vast sea—
**Explication:** I alone drift and flow like the river and sea, boundless in extent.

○**Shu:** The *Héshàng* [River Above] text reads *hǎi* [sea]. **Huì** means dark, **zhǐ** means to stop or dwell. Though the Sage’s wisdom is truly luminous, it drifts like darkness seeking to reveal itself—bright yet not dazzling. Thus, this saying emerges.

Though mingling with the dust of the world,
Yet ever serene and still—
And not fixed in this stillness—
Thus, no true dwelling or halting.

Like drifting without end—
**Explication:** I alone drift and drift, as if rising and unbound, my spirit and intention soaring in the realm of the divine.

○**Yu:** My heart is still, severed from worldly learning, as if without attachment or fixation.

All others have **yǐ**—
**Explication:** *Yǐ*, worldly striving.

I alone am dull, like the vulgar—
**Explication:** I alone have no striving, seeming vulgar and lacking.

○**Yu:** **Wán** means undivided; **bǐ** means insufficient, yet my heart truly comprehends. Though appearing insufficient, thus I say *like the vulgar*.

○**Shu:** The vulgar are mired in sensory desires, never resting. Though they may take different paths, they all share the same worldly attachments. The Sage’s wisdom penetrates the false and the real, never distinguishing. Neither seeing what is right nor knowing what is wrong, like the dull and vulgar, yet in truth, it is thus.

I alone differ from others—
**Explication:** I alone am distinct from people.

○**Yu:** Others are bound by emotions and desires; I have no tainted heart.

And I alone honor **shímǔ**—
**Explication:** *Shí*, to employ; *mǔ*, the Dao/Way.

I alone hold the Dao/Way in highest regard.

○**Shu:** Others distinguish and cling to sensory pleasures; I alone drift in forgetfulness. Distinction leads to attachment to sounds and colors; forgetfulness leads to reverence for the true Dao/Way—thus my difference.

The **vast virtue’s** appearance—
**Explication:** *Kong*, great/extreme; the bearing of one with great virtue.

One with great virtue encompasses all without exception,
**Explication:** able to receive filth and turbidity, to dwell in humility.
Only the Dao/Way is followed.

**Explication:** *Wei*, alone; one with great virtue does not conform to worldly practices but follows the Dao/Way alone.

○**Shu:** The great/extreme virtue’s bearing—how does it appear?
Only in following the Dao/Way does its form manifest.
**Alternative:** *Róng*, to encompass; great virtue’s profound harmony
thus moves the heart and shapes conduct, following the Dao/Way alone.
In speech and silence, actions and reticence, all are Dao/Way’s domains.

The Dao/Way, as a thing—
**Explication:** The Dao/Way’s relation to all things:
It alone comes and goes in their midst.

○**Yu:** This reveals the Dao/Way that the great virtue follows—
neither having nor lacking, beyond naming or verification,
hence it is *hunhuáng*.

○**Shu:** Of the supreme Dao/Way as a thing,
It neither has nor lacks, yet though it has, it lacks;
though it lacks, it does not lack.
Its presence and absence are indeterminate,
thus it is *huánghū*.

Why speak of "thing"?
To clarify the Dao/Way does not depart from things,
things do not depart from the Dao/Way;
outside the Dao/Way, there are no things,
outside things, there is no Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way and things are one in function,
one in essence—
also, enlightenment is the unity of things and Dao/Way,
delusion is their duality.
Things and Dao/Way are neither one nor two,
yet one while not one—
not Dao/Way, not things,
yet Dao/Way and things are not two.
Hence, one is not one,
and things are not dual.

○**Gù:** It seeks to define presence,
yet has no color, no sound;
to say it lacks presence,
yet it has emotion, has faith—
for its essence cannot be defined,
thus it is *hunhuáng*.

Within *hunhuáng* there is form,
**Explication:** Though the Dao/Way is *hunhuáng* and shapeless,
it alone sets patterns for all things.

○**Yu:** *Hū*, lacking; *huáng*, having.
Its traces appear as daily forms.
From the void descending into manifestation,
it becomes the form of all things.

Within *hunhuáng* there is substance,
**Explication:** Though the Dao/Way is *hunhuáng*,
within it there is unity—
nurturing and transforming, establishing form through *qi*.

○**Shu:** Within it is substance—
this is the divine mystery,
the wondrous thing named.
Though neither lacking nor having,
it contains an unfathomable substance.
Within it is form—
this is *qi*, though neither form nor color,
it becomes form and color,
thus it is *qi*.
Speaking of the Dao/Way’s manifold transformations,
it is neither lacking nor having in things,
neither lacking nor having in form.

Within *yǎomiǎng* there is essence.
**Explication:** Though the Dao/Way is *yǎomiǎng* and formless,
within it there is essence—
the subtle interplay of yin and yang
to establish form and spirit.

○**Jiě:** Refers to the original *qi* in the brain transforming into essence.

○**Yu:** *Hū* and *huáng* are presence and absence,
*yǎomiǎng* is unfathomable.
In generation and transformation,
the essence is wondrously preserved.

○**Shu:** *Yǎomiǎng*, profound and distant.
Within it is essence—*wisdom*.
The Dao/Way, though profound and distant, *hū* and *huáng*,
possesses wondrous essence and spirit—
its wisdom shines without bounds,
its divine power unfathomable.

Its essence is most true,
**Explication:** The Dao/Way’s essence, *qi*, and spirit are wondrously true,
without adornment.

○**Shu:** Its true essence is unmixed,
not empty or false.
Among the three-in-one, it emphasizes essence
to reveal essence as the root of *qi*, color, and spirit’s function.

○**Gù:** The supreme Dao/Way’s essence and spirit are utterly true, without falsehood.

Within it there is faith.
**Explication:** The Dao/Way hides its function, conceals its name,
its faith resides within.

○**Jiě:** Refers to *essence*.
If essence does not transform and blood does not store,
then one becomes a true person.
In one’s conduct, within it there is faith.

○**Shu:** The Dao/Way has no mind,
yet responds to stimuli without fail—
faith like the four seasons,
never out of step.
From ancient times to the present,
its name does not depart,
**Explication:** *Zì*, from; from ancient times to the present,
the Dao/Way remains ever-present.

○**Jiě:** *Name* refers to the Dao/Way;
the Sage does not die, his name endures.

○**Shu:** Time has ancient and present,
yet the Dao/Way has neither coming nor going.
Since its name does not depart,
it suffices to show it has no coming—
the text is concise.

With this, it observes all things at their beginning.
**Explication:** *Yuè*, to receive/embody; *fǔ*, initial.
The Dao/Way can embody and bestow,
all things begin to arise—
they receive *qi* from the Dao/Way.

○**Shu:** *Yuè*, to survey; *fǔ*, initial.
Though the supreme Dao/Way has neither coming nor going,
it also goes and comes—
thus it surveys ancient and present,
responds to all ends and beginnings.

How do I know all things arise thus?
**Explication:** How do I know all things receive *qi* from the Dao/Way?

With this.
**Explication:** *This*, the present;
with the present, all things gain the Dao/Way’s essence and *qi* to arise.
Human actions, movements, and dwellings
without the Dao/Way would not be.

○**Shu:** A rhetorical question posed.
Laozi asks: How do I know the affairs of beginning and end?
Only through this pure and faithful Dao/Way,
the joyous and *hū* *yǎomiǎng* method,
do I know it.

Bending brings fullness,
**Explication:** *Qū*, to bend oneself to others;
not asserting oneself brings fullness.

○**Shu:** Flexible and compliant,
not clinging to things’ emotions—
gentle and weak, humble and harmonious,
preserving life’s Dao/Way,
thus *Zhuangzi* says:
I walk in curves, yet my feet remain unharmed,
this sentence forgets compliance.

Perverting brings rectitude,
**Explication:** *Yǎng*, to bend oneself while extending to others;
long-term, one attains rectitude.

○**Shu:** *Yǎng*, to err/transgress.
Knowing transgression and error are not dual,
one can receive slander without retaliating—
thus, perversion gains true rectitude.
This sentence forgets praise and blame.

Hollow brings abundance,
**Explication:** *Dì*, earth; hollow and low,
water flows into it—
humble and low, virtue returns to it.

Worn brings renewal,
**Explication:** *Bì*, to receive harm/thinness;
self-sacrifice for others, the world respects it—
long-term, one attains renewal.

○**Commentary:** *Dì*, to be low/humble.
Humble and yielding, retiring oneself to lowliness,
not competing with others—
thus virtue and conduct overflow abundantly.
This sentence forgets the high and the low.

**Explication:** *Bì*, to be worn/harmed.
To endure dishonor and vileness while not coveting glory and favor,
one’s virtue renews daily—
this again forgets honor and disgrace.

**Moderation brings gain,**
**Explication:** *Shǎo*, to take little—then one gains much.
The Dao/Way of Heaven favors the humble,
the divine illuminates the empty.
**Excess brings confusion,**
**Explication:** *Duō*, to be excessive.
The vulgar, with many thoughts and desires,
walk without steadfastness—
thus they are confused.

○**Commentary:** *Shǎo* refers to the complete practice of *Yǎng* (bending/extending),
unaware of high and low,
dwelling in the singular middle.

*Duō* refers to being stuck in the duality of *Wéi Shùn* (compliance/transgression),
never leaving the two extremes.

To embody the singular middle—then gain is attained;
to cling to the two extremes—then confusion arises.

Thus the sage holds the One as the model for all under Heaven.
**Explication:** *Bào*, to guard/hold.
*Shì*, law/pattern.
The sage guards the One and thus knows all things,
making it the law/pattern for all under Heaven.

○**Commentary:** It means to focus on the One Dao/Way,
to guard the balance of the self.

○**Commentary:** *Shì*, law/pattern.
The sage upholds this singular middle Dao/Way,
guiding all beings by its path—
thus becoming the exemplar for all under Heaven’s cultivation.

**Not self-illuminating—then clarity,**
**Explication:** The sage does not see the world as through his own eyes,
but uses the sight of all under Heaven to perceive it—
thus attaining clarity.

○**Commentary:** *Wù* (things) and *wǒ* (self) alike are empty,
no perception of self or form—
thus wisdom shines brightly.

**Not self-righteous—then brilliance,**
**Explication:** The sage does not assert his own correctness while rejecting others—
thus his virtue/power shines in the world.

○**Commentary:** Self and others are equal;
not asserting correctness in oneself or in things—
thus his virtue/power is manifest and evident.

**Not self-praising—then merit,**
**Explication:** *Fá*, to take/claim.
The sage’s virtue/power flows naturally,
not claiming its own beauty—
thus it benefits all under Heaven.

○**Commentary:** Though he may be merciful to all beings,
he humbles himself as their dog (servant),
attributing merit to others—
thus he attains great merit.

**Not self-glorifying—then longevity.**
**Explication:** *Jīng*, to magnify/boast.
The sage does not exalt himself—
thus his virtue/power endures without peril.

○**Commentary:** Only by attributing merit to others,
not boasting or magnifying—
thus his virtue/power lasts far and wide.

**For only the non-competing—
none under Heaven can compete with them.**
**Explication:** *Zhēng*, to contend.
This praises those of the four virtues,
who grasp compliance/transgression subtly,
cultivate themselves with humility—
and do not contend with others—
thus all ranks under Heaven cannot contend with the non-competing.

**The ancients’ saying—"Flexibility brings wholeness"—
was it idle speech?**

**Explication:** *Qū*, to bend.
*Zéng*, to follow.
The ancients said that bending and yielding in compliance
preserves one’s Dao/Way—
this saying is true, not idle.
Only by following the teachings and practicing accordingly,
not contending with others—
one attains complete virtue/power,
and all things return to oneself.

Thus, **wholeness is indeed attained and returned.**

**Explication:** *Chéng*, reality/truth.
Those who practice bending and yielding
truly preserve their body and mind,
returning to their parents (nature)—
no harm comes to them.

**Sparse speech is natural.**
**Explication:** *Xī*, to love/minimize.
Those who love minimizing speech
embody the Dao/Way of Nature.

○**Commentary:** *Xī*, few/sparse.
If one loves few words and sparse speech,
then actions align with Nature’s Dao/Way.

○**Commentary:** *Xī*, to minimize.
Minimizing speech is to forget speech.
The ultimate of Nature is the *Chóng Xuán* (profound emptiness).
Dao/Way seeks to clarify the ultimate,
which transcends speech.
Speech itself deviates from principle—
only by forgetting speech and discarding teaching,
can one aptly meet the profound emptiness.

**Gale winds do not last a morning,
torrent rains do not last a day.**

**Explication:** *Piāo*, drifting.
*Fēng*, wind.
*Zòu*, sudden.
*Yǔ*, rain.
It says that swiftness cannot endure,
violence cannot persist.

○**Commentary:** Drifting winds and sudden rains
do not even last a morning—
how could they endure a full day?
It likens those who cling to teaching, lost in doctrine,
to rash actions in pursuit of swift rewards—
their resolve is fleeting and cannot last long,
hence the comparison to gale winds and torrent rains.

Day is the total of morning,
morning is a division of day—
the division illustrates the newness of each moment,
the total signifies the span of a hundred years,
both convey impermanence.

○**Commentary:** Mountains and valleys communicate,
giving rise to gale winds.
Yin-qi erupts,
forming torrent rains.
When yin and yang lose their rhythms,
then gale winds and sudden rains occur.
If humans lose the middle harmony,
then they become violent and swift.
Ruining the body and losing substance—
this cannot be sustained.
Sudden violence is not constant,
Nature cannot endure it long—
thus it is said: "They do not last a morning."

○**Commentary:** Heaven disperses yang-qi downward,
which becomes wind;
Earth ascends yin-qi upward,
which condenses into rain.

○**Commentary:** Heaven is vigorous, Earth is yielding,
the divine qi is uniquely absolute—
this causes sudden violence and swiftness,
yet even this cannot last a full day,
let alone the vulgar, who are born in the morning and die in the evening,
and whose many words harm others—
how could they endure?

○**Commentary:** The greatest forms are Heaven and Earth.
The most expansive qi are yin and yang.
When yin and yang clash,
Heaven and Earth intertwine—
gale winds and sudden rains arise,
yet cannot last long.
How much more so for humans,
so small and fragile between Heaven and Earth,
who perish swiftly from excessive speech—
their swift extinction is known.

**Who causes this?**
Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth cannot endure long—
*[Note: They cannot last from morning to evening.]*
How much more so for humans?
*[Note: Heaven and Earth are supremely divine; when they combine to produce gale winds and sudden rains, they still cannot last from morning to evening. How much more so for humans, who seek sudden death?]*

○ **Exegesis:**
*"Who"*—this is a rhetorical question asking who causes the winds and rains.
The answer is: The Two Principles of Heaven and Earth generate and transform with great divine power.
Even gale winds and sudden rains cannot endure long—
how much more so for the vulgar, whose reckless actions
cannot last?
Thus, those who practice the Dao—
*[Note: "From" here means "to engage in." Humans should act in accordance with the Dao’s tranquility, not like gale winds and sudden rains.]*
○ **Yu’s Commentary:**
Those who practice the Dao should not cling to rigid teachings.
Those who embody the Dao awaken to it and forget speech—
thus, they align with the Dao itself.
○ **Exegesis:**
"Following the Dao" means yielding to it.
"Affairs" refers to worldly matters.
Those who embody supreme virtue act in accordance with both principle and reality,
with the Dao and with things—
thus, they naturally remain empty and fluid,
just as Confucius said: *"Only the Dao is worth following."*

○ **Cai’s Commentary:**
If all actions conform to the Dao,
then the Dao is attained—
this is the harmony of Dao’s operation.

○ **Wang’s Commentary:**
To reverse conventional teachings and conform to the Dao,
one must abandon all burdens and merge with emptiness—
this is called aligning with the Dao.
The Dao responds accordingly.

*[Note: This is because one’s actions and understanding merge,
allowing perception and wisdom to converge naturally.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
"Dao attained" means attaining the Dao.
Those who align with virtue also attain virtue.
*[Note: "Virtue" here refers to those who cultivate virtue.
Those who align with virtue act in accordance with it.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
The Dao is the eternal principle;
virtue is the highest virtue.
Those who embody both teaching and practice, forgetting speech,
act in harmony with supreme virtue—
thus, virtue naturally resonates and responds in kind.
The Dao is the essence of virtue;
virtue is the manifestation of the Dao.
Speaking of essence, we call it Dao;
speaking of manifestation, we call it virtue—
hence the two expressions.

Those who align with loss also lose.
*[Note: "Loss" refers to acting selfishly and failing others.]*
Those who align with loss also lose.
*[Note: Those who act in accordance with loss also delight in loss.]*
Those who align with the Dao also find the Dao delights in them.
*[Note: Those who align with the Dao also find the Dao delights in them.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
Those who act recklessly, cling to teachings, and remain deluded
ultimately align with those who act against principle—
thus, they cannot attain empty-hearted unity.
As for those who claim to speak of the Dao yet fail—
this is akin to losing the Dao itself.
Thus, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:
*"In past lives, you did not study;
now you consort with those who stray."*

Those who align with virtue also find virtue delights in them.
*[Note: Those who align with virtue also find virtue delights in them.]*
Those who align with loss also find loss delights in them.
*[Note: Those who align with loss also find loss delights in them.]*

Lacking faith is met with disbelief.
*[Note: If the ruler lacks faith in his subjects,
the subjects respond with disbelief.]*
There is disbelief.
*[Note: This speaks of natural affinities:
dragons gather where dragons are,
winds follow tigers,
water flows to moisture,
fire seeks dryness—
these are the laws of nature.]*
○ **Yu’s Commentary:**
Clinging to speech and rigid teachings,
one fails to awaken—
this is the root of insufficient faith.
Aligning with loss, loss seeks them—
this is the manifestation of disbelief.
○ **Exegesis:**
Unable to forget speech and instead seeking principle through words,
though one claims to have faith in the Dao,
one’s understanding remains insufficient.
Thus, clinging to speech and rigid teachings,
one fails to grasp the true source—
hence, in the realm of the Triple Mystery,
one harbors doubt.

Those who advance arrogantly cannot stand.
*[Note: "Advance" here means greedy for power and fame,
seeking glory and honor—
such actions cannot sustain one’s conduct or the Dao.]*
Those who strut cannot walk.
*[Note: Those who consider themselves noble and domineer over others
are despised by the crowd,
preventing them from proceeding.]*
Those who self-display are blind.
*[Note: People who admire their own appearance or actions,
believing them virtuous,
are unaware of their ugliness or vulgarity.]*
○ **Yu’s Commentary:**
Flashing talent and boasting of oneself
only invites criticism—
thus, one remains unseen.
○ **Exegesis:**
This is because one cannot forget the self.

Those who insist on being right are not illuminated.
*[Note: Those who insist on their own correctness while rejecting others
are despised by the crowd,
preventing their virtue from shining.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
The crowd despises them—
thus, their virtue remains hidden.

Those who boast of their own merits achieve nothing.
*[Note: Those who constantly praise their own achievements
lose the true credit of having helped others.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
Whenever they act, they immediately claim credit,
and others refuse to acknowledge their contributions—
thus, they achieve no true merit.

Those who pride themselves cannot endure.
*[Note: Those who boast of their own greatness
cannot last long.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
Arrogance and vanity, contempt for others—
this is short-sightedness.
How could such virtue endure?

Such people bring only excess consumption and superfluous actions to the Dao.
*[Note: "Excess" here means greed.]*
If such boastful, self-praising individuals govern a state,
they daily extort surplus taxes and luxuries for their own gluttony.
○ **Exegesis:**
"Excess consumption" refers to leftover food—
"superfluous" refers to useless flesh, as in *Zhuangzi*:
*"Hanging warts and parasitic growths."*
Such prideful, self-righteous people,
in their Daoist practice,
are like leftover food and parasitic growths—
how despicable they are.

People may come to hate them.
*[Note: Such individuals in power act harmfully,
so all fear and despise them.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
Superfluous flesh is useless;
boastful actions are meaningless.
Those who cultivate the Dao would never harbor such vain ambitions.

Thus, those who embody the Dao do not dwell [in any one place].
*[Note: Those who follow the Dao do not remain fixed in any realm or state.]*

There exists a primal unity that coalesced before Heaven and Earth came into being.
*[Note: This refers to the Dao—formless and indistinct, yet giving rise to all things before Heaven and Earth existed.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
The "primal unity" is the Dao.
The Dao is neither a thing nor not a thing,
neither formless nor formed,
yet it generates all existence—
thus it is both indistinct and distinct.
As *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The divine and the sovereign spirits,
giving birth to Heaven and Earth,
yet not aging—*
*Silent and boundless,
self-sufficient and unchanging."*

Silent and void,
it stands alone without peer,
unchanging in its transformations.
*[Note: Silent—without sound; void—without form.
Alone—without counterpart.
Unchanging—its transformations are constant.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
Silent—no sound.
Void—no form.
Alone—no dependence on another.
Unchanging—no alteration or decay.
The Dao’s essence is profound and obscure,
its form and sound extinguished,
neither dependent nor altered—
this is the singularity beyond mere singularity.

Its circulation is boundless and unceasing,
*[Note: The Dao permeates Heaven and Earth without obstruction,
neither scorching in the sun nor rotting in the shade,
penetrating all things without peril or failure.]*
○ **Exegesis (Node Analysis):**
The Sage embodies the Dao within the body,
flowing through limbs, joints, orifices, and pores—
thus its circulation is boundless and unceasing.

It can be the mother of all under Heaven.
*[Note: The Dao nurtures all things,
its vital essence like a mother to her children.]*
○ **Exegesis (Node Analysis):**
The Sage who guards the Dao and embodies unity
is the mother of all under Heaven.
○ **Exegesis:**
The Dao is everywhere—
its circulation is boundless,
its presence universal—
thus there is no peril or failure.
It opens and harmonizes yin and yang,
establishes Heaven and Earth,
nurtures all beings,
and gives birth to all sentient life—
thus it is the mother.

I know not its name,
so I call it the Dao.
*[Note: I see no form to name the Dao,
yet all things arise from it—
thus I name it the Dao.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
The Dao cannot be grasped by intellect;
its name was first mentioned in the opening chapter:
*"The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth."*
Taking its pervasive generative virtue,
I name it the Dao.

I forcefully name it **Great**.
*[Note: Unable to name it truly,
I call it Great—
vast and without limit,
encompassing all without exclusion.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
Its essence knows no bounds—
thus it is called Great.
Not *great* in the ordinary sense—
thus it is called *Great* by force.
Names summon the essence,
characters express the virtue—
the Dao is its function,
the Great is its substance—
thus it is named *Great* and called *Dao*.
Men usually name first, then characterize,
but here the order is reversed
to contrast the Dao with the common.

The Great is called **Passing**.
*[Note: Its greatness is not like Heaven’s fixed position above
nor Earth’s fixed position below—
it moves on, without permanence.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
*Passing*—to go.
With great power, it guides all beings
to the Sage’s realm.

*Passing* is called **Distant**.
*[Note: Distant—extending to the boundless,
its qi permeating Heaven and Earth without obstruction.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
Ascending beyond the Three Realms,
reaching the Three Purities.
*Distant*—to return.
*[Note: Return—restoration.]*
Having perfected the Dao within,
attaining the distant Sage’s realm,
it returns to the mortal world
to compassionately save all beings.
*Alternative Exegesis:*
When lost, the Three Purities are the Three Realms;
when enlightened, the Three Realms are the Three Purities—
thus its return to the mundane is the Great Void Heaven above.

Thus, the Dao is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
and the Sovereign is Great.
*[Note: The Dao is Great—encompassing Heaven and Earth without limit.
Heaven is Great—covering all without exclusion.
Earth is Great—bearing all without failure.
The Sovereign is Great—controlling all without overreach.
Within the realm, there are these four Great ones,
and the Sovereign occupies one of them.]*
○ **Exegesis (Command):**
The Sovereign is the master of humanity,
the fate of all things resting on his rise or fall.
To warn and admonish him,
it is said the Sovereign occupies one of the four.
○ **Exegesis:**
Within the domain, these four Great ones exist,
and the Sovereign, with his transformative virtue,
follows Heaven and Earth in occupying one place.
As *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The Dao was never confined by boundaries—
speaking of ‘within the realm’ is to say
though confined, it is not confined,
though not confined, it is confined—
discussing confinement,
though confined, it is not confined—
encompassing all without limit."*

○ **Exegesis (Node Analysis):**
The lungs are Great,
the heart is Great,
the liver is Great,
the spleen is Great—
kidney water generates the One,
and the Sovereign governs from the One,
as the spleen’s qi spreads unity in all directions.

The Sovereign should model himself after Earth—
*[Note: The ruler must emulate Earth’s stillness, gentleness, and yielding nature.]*

The cultivation of the five grains yields abundance,
and digging yields sweet springs—
laboring without complaint,
with merit yet unclaimed.

Earth follows Heaven,
*[Heaven is serene and unmoving,
bestowing without seeking return,
nurturing all things yet taking nothing.]*

Heaven follows the Dao,
*[The Dao acts with effortless clarity,
its subtle qi moving unseen,
and all things form without contrivance.]*

The Dao follows *ziran* [自然].
*[The Dao’s nature is spontaneous—
it follows nothing, transcending all imitation.]*

○ **Exegesis (Commentary):**
The ruler must emulate Earth—
calmness in action, for only then
does wisdom arise.
Thus the next passage states:
*"Agitation loses sovereignty—
when still as Earth,
he must next follow Heaven’s purity,
nurturing all without partiality."*

Heaven has the Three Lights—
a metaphor for wisdom’s illumination—
Earth is the gate of *ding* [定, steadfastness],
Heaven the gate of wisdom.
Having aligned with Heaven,
he must next follow the Dao’s boundless openness,
embracing all things.

Having aligned with the Dao,
he must then follow *ziran*’s profound mystery—
the realm of *Chóngxuān* [重玄].
The Dao is the path,
*ziran* is its essence—
to grasp the essence is to master the path,
hence the saying, *"to follow."*

Further elucidation:
The Dao’s nature is *ziran*—
it follows nothing,
transcending all cultivation,
thus it is said, *"the Dao follows ziran."*

*Chóng* [重] is the root of *qīng* [轻]—
*[For rulers, neglecting weightiness brings disrespect;
in self-cultivation, neglect brings loss of vitality—
flowers and leaves are light and fall,
roots are heavy and endure.]*

○ **Commentary:**
This warns against recklessness,
for it is written:
*"The noble does not act lightly, lest he lose authority."*

Stillness governs agitation—
*[A ruler’s agitation brings ruin;
in self-cultivation, agitation brings peril—
the dragon’s stillness allows transformation,
the tiger’s agitation invites early death.]*

○ **Commentary:**
Stillness is non-action;
agitation is desire—
desire brings death,
non-action brings longevity.
Stillness masters movement,
thus it is the ruler’s essence.

Hence the sage moves through life
yet never departs from *zhīzhòng* [辎重].
*[Zhī: stillness. Zhòng: weightiness.]*
The sage walks the Dao all day,
never straying from stillness and weightiness.

○ **Commentary:**
The noble and enlightened move through the world,
yet remain rooted in weightiness and stillness—
this is motion in tranquility.

Though adorned with palaces and halls,
their repose is transcendent.
*[Palaces: the royal halls.
Halls: the consorts’ quarters.
Transcendent: detached, uninvolved.]*

○ **Commentary:**
Those who embody weightiness and stillness,
though surrounded by splendor and comfort,
dwell in emptiness and detachment,
untainted by worldly pleasures.

How then does the sovereign of ten thousand chariots—
*[Naihe: a lament for the times, a sorrowful exclamation.
Ten thousand chariots: the king.]*
—abandon the greatest treasure, the realm?
*[The realm is the supreme position of authority.]*
How can the ruler indulge his body in excess,
squander his vital essence,
and lose his throne?

○ **Commentary:**
*Naihe* means *"how is this possible?"*
The king, ruling a thousand-li domain,
commanding ten thousand chariots,
must uphold weightiness and stillness—
yet he indulges in licentiousness and debauchery,
imposes heavy taxes and unrest,
pursues sensual excess and ruinous desires,
neglects his inner chambers—
his lament is profound,
thus it is asked: *how is this possible?*
And yet he treats his body with such levity,
risking the realm’s collapse.

*[The ruler, though noble, must guard the One for longevity—
seeing yet not learning,
he treats his body lightly,
and thus meets his end.
Even with jade goblets and gold carvings,
what use are they to a lifeless corpse?]*

Lightness brings loss of ministers,
*[The ruler’s indulgence alienates his ministers;
self-neglect dissipates vital essence.]*
agitation brings loss of sovereignty.
*[The ruler’s haste undermines his authority;
agitation depletes his spirit.]*

○ **Exegesis:**
Those consumed by restless thought
cannot attain longevity.

○ **Commentary:**
Indulgence and agitation grow worse by the day—
externally, the nation falls;
internally, the body perishes.
Loyal ministers flee,
the throne collapses—
loss of ministers,
loss of sovereignty.

The virtuous path leaves no trace,
*[The true practitioner seeks virtue within—
no need to step outside,
no need to leave the hall,
thus no tracks remain.]*

○ **Commentary:**
To act without action,
to move without form—
this is the virtuous path,
a subtle accord with cultivation.
When mind and wisdom merge,
no traces appear—
this reveals a pure life.

The virtuous word has no flaws,
*[The virtuous speaker chooses words with care,
leaving no blemish or reproach in the world.]*

○ **Exegesis:**
The enlightened teach without obstruction,
transcending literal forms,
seeking meaning beyond symbols,
forgetting speech in its essence—
thus their words are without fault.

○ **Commentary:**
Speech that is not spoken,
spoken yet not spoken—
all day speaking yet never speaking,
nor ever not speaking—
this is the virtuous word.
As *Zhuangzi* says:
*"When words suffice, one speaks all day yet exhausts the Dao."*

Flaws are defects,
reproach is censure.
Speech and silence are one,
thus no blame attaches to the mouth—
this reveals a pure tongue.

The virtuous plan requires no calculations,
*[The virtuous strategist acts without scheming,
needing no abacus or reckoning.]*

「The virtuous strategist who calculates through the Dao/Way
holds fast to the One without deviation,
though myriad affairs arise,
yet needs no abacus or reckoning—
the path is clear.

○ **Exegesis:**
The subtle insight of all dharmas as One in emptiness and illusion,
abandoning neither emptiness nor illusion,
then the false body becomes true—
effortless clarity,
no need for scheming or calculation,
this reveals the purity of intent.

The virtuous closure knows no latch or bolt that can be opened,
*[The virtuous who seals through the Dao/Way restrains emotions and desires,
guarding the spirit—
no door or barrier can be forced open,
nor can it be unlocked.]*

○ **Commentary:**
*[The Dao/Way seals the mind,
not like a door with a latch or bolt that can be pried open.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
This refers to closing the breath and firming the spirit,
sealing the celestial *yin* (天牝),
retaining the earthly *yang* (地牡)—
thus it is said, "no latch or bolt."

○ **Exegesis:**
*[The virtuous transcend both speech and action,
not entering any false path—
the mind is free from entanglement in phenomena,
phenomena bear no burden of arising thoughts,
though no latch or barrier exists,
how could it ever be opened?]*

○ **Exegesis:**
*[Externally, there are no desirable objects;
internally, there is no desiring mind—
when the root of desire is employed,
employed yet unstained,
this is non-closure yet closure,
though closed, not closed—
no need for latches or bolts,
thus it cannot be opened.]*

The virtuous knot requires no rope or binding that can be undone.
*[The virtuous who binds through the Dao/Way
merely binds the mind—
no rope or cord can force its release.]*

○ **Exegesis:**
*[The noble one perceives true reality,
fundamentally abandoning all attachment—
if one can abandon attachment,
then the mind aligns with the Dao/Way,
though no rope or cord exists,
how could it ever be undone?]*

○ **Exegesis:**
The noble ones of the first rank
prioritize others over themselves,
harbor vast compassionate vows,
transform and guide all beings—
their resolve is unyielding,
their bonds unbroken,
not constrained by worldly ropes or cords,
thus they cannot be undone.

Yet such vows are manifold,
yet they reduce to five:
1. The vow of awakening intent,
   *[to enter my path and embrace the natural Dao/Way.]*
2. The vow of subduing the mind,
   *[to conquer all obstacles and delusions.]*
3. The vow of knowing the true mind,
   *[which bears nine grades,
   yielding birth to the nine officials.]*
4. The vow of emancipating the mind,
   *[which bears three grades,
   yielding birth to the Three Pure Ones—
   the Sage, the True, and the Holy.]*
5. The vow of the peerless mind,
   *[to ascend directly to the Dao/Way’s fruit,
   even attaining the Great Void.]*

The virtuous knotting binds these five minds
without ever faltering—
this is the vow’s firm resolve.
○ **Exegesis:**
*[This refers to binding the soul and spirit,
the Sage holding fast to them—
thus it is said, "unbreakable."]*

The Sage ever holds the soul and spirit,
thus it is said, "unbreakable."

Therefore, the Sage is always virtuous in saving beings,
*[for the Sage’s constant teaching of loyalty and filial piety
seeks to rescue the essence of human nature.]*

○ **Exegesis:**
The Sage is one whose three actions are pure,
whose six senses are liberated.
To awaken vast vows,
to rescue and guide all beings,
the Sage remains in the world,
responding to each need—
compassionate, equitable, and boundless,
never abandoning any.

And yet, no being is abandoned;
*[for the Sage guides the noble and lowly to their proper place.]*

Always virtuous in saving all things,
*[for the Sage teaches the people to follow the four seasons,
thus sparing all creatures from harm.]*

Thus, no thing is abandoned.
*[The Sage does not deem stone less precious than jade,
but views them as equal.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
First, the Sage’s virtue extends to all sentient beings,
then, to all things—
saving beings directly through the common folk,
saving creatures through the four seasons—
this is called *clinging to clarity*.

*[The Sage’s virtue in saving all things
is called clinging to the clarity of Heaven’s Dao/Way.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
*Clinging* means to uphold, to employ.
Thus, the Sage’s virtue in praising the Sage’s constancy,
benefiting all without abandon,
may be called upholding and employing the Sage’s Way.

The virtuous are teachers to the unvirtuous;
*[those who practice virtue
the Sage takes as teachers for humanity.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
The virtuous are those who follow the clarity of the Way,
ever bearing a great mind,
prioritizing others over themselves,
guiding all beings—
truly the master craftsmen of the path.

The unvirtuous are the material for the virtuous;
*[material, here meaning resource or means.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
*[The Sage always transforms and guides the multitude,
using even the unvirtuous as a field of merit,
for the benefit of all beings
thus perfects my virtue.]*

The Sage does not esteem their teachers,
*[for there is no reliance.]*
nor cherish their resources,
*[for there is no purpose.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
*[If one retains the notion of teachers and resources,
this is not yet the ultimate.]*

Now, the reason the Sage esteems teachers
is to preserve the form of learning;
once the form of learning is empty,
naturally there is no esteem.
The reason the Sage cherishes resources
is to preserve the form of teaching;
in teaching, forgetting teaching,
thus no resources are cherished.
Esteem and cherishing both forgotten,
the Dao/Way transforms naturally.
Though one may seem deeply deluded,
*[though one may think oneself knowing,
this person is truly great delusion.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
*[There is no transformation.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
The Sage guides the multitude,
encouraging them to study and cultivate.
Now, the Sage’s equality with the vulgar
discards the notion of teachers and resources—
thus, from shallow to profound,
gradually ascending to all wonders,
this is called *essential subtlety*.

*[One who grasps this meaning
is said to know the subtle and essential Dao/Way.]*
○ **Exegesis:**
Discarding teachers and resources,
the Sage and the vulgar are one—
though one may seem deeply deluded,
according to principle,
they truly attain essential subtlety.

Knowing one’s strength as *yang*,
guarding one’s weakness as *yin*,
one becomes the Dao/Way of the world’s valleys.
*[Strength as *yang* symbolizes the exalted,
*yin* the humble—
though one knows their own nobility,
they must also retain humility,
abandoning the rigidity of *yang*,
embracing the harmony of *yin*—
thus all under Heaven will follow,
as water flows into deep valleys.]*

○ **Exegesis:**
*Valley* means path.
*Yang* is the name for the vigorous and harsh,
*yin* for the gentle and tranquil.
Knowing the vigor of *yang* leads to ruin and death,
*yin*’s gentleness brings longevity—
thus, discarding *yang* and guarding *yin*,
one attains the essential path of the world’s harmony.

○ **Exegesis on *Nodes*:**
The *yang* is the *hun* soul—
the worthy scholar follows the Way,
guarding natural spontaneity,
drawing in and closing the *qi*,
embracing and holding the *hun* and *po* souls.
Constant virtue never departs—
*[For when one remains humble as a deep valley,
virtue abides and does not stray.]*
Return once more to the state of an infant.
*[One must return one’s mind to the innocence of an infant,
serene and without knowledge.]*

○ **Exegesis on *Nodes*:**
*Valley* means *mouth*—
when one practices *yi* (one-ness) and closes the *qi* in stillness,
there is no action.
*[Thus, one does not age;
returning to the state of an infant.]*
*[Exegesis:]* *Depart* means to disperse;
the infant is a metaphor for undifferentiated wisdom.
When one constantly guards stillness,
virtue does not disperse,
and thus returns to its original nature,
reverting to wisdom without distinction.

Guard its darkness,
and become the model for all under Heaven.
*[White symbolizes brilliance,
darkness symbolizes obscurity—
though one knows their own clarity,
they must also guard obscurity,
as if in darkness with nothing to see—
thus, they become the standard for all under Heaven,
and virtue remains constant.]*
*[Exegesis:]* White is luminous clarity.
Darkness is obscurity.
*Model* means *law*.
To display oneself openly and flaunt before others
is certain to provoke resistance—
not the conduct of the wise.
Withdrawing brilliance and concealing traces,
retiring into obscurity,
one does not offend against things—
thus, they are the virtuous person.
Those who know the benefits and harms of light and dark
can serve as the grand exemplar for cultivators.

To become the model for all under Heaven,
virtue never falters—
*[For when one becomes the standard for all under Heaven,
virtue abides within them,
never deviating.]*

○ **Exegesis on *Nodes*:**
This means the Dao is practiced in *yi* (one-ness) to attain transcendence,
becoming the model for all under Heaven.
Return once more to the *Wuji* (Non-Extreme).
*[When virtue does not deviate,
longevity and eternal life are attained,
and the body returns to the boundless.]*

○ **Exegesis on *Nodes*:**
This means constantly guarding the *sheng* (life) practice in *yi* (one-ness) without limit.
*[Exegesis:]* *Deviate* means to stray.
*Wuji* is the Dao.
When one constantly abandons brightness and guards darkness,
virtue does not stray,
restoring purity and returning to the ultimate Dao.

Know its glory,
guard its humiliation,
and become the valley of all under Heaven.
*[Glory symbolizes nobility,
humiliation symbolizes filth—
though one knows their own honor,
they must also guard humiliation,
as if in filth—
thus, all under Heaven will follow,
like water flowing into deep valleys.]*
*[Exegesis:]* Glory is favor and nobility.
Humiliation is lowliness and disgrace.
Dwelling in glory and nobility,
one may rise to arrogance and extravagance,
and suddenly—
as good fortune turns to misfortune and lust to ruin—
one’s former glory becomes the foundation of calamity.
If one knows that rise and fall are inconstant,
that nobility is the beginning of disaster,
one must restrain themselves
and not indulge in dissipation.
Dwelling in splendor yet ever as lowly,
nobility is rooted in humility,
and height is founded on the lowly.
Thus, knowing glory and humiliation,
all under Heaven will follow,
like rivers converging in the empty valleys.

To become the valley of all under Heaven,
virtue is then complete—
*[Complete means to cease;
when one becomes the valley for all under Heaven,
virtue finds its fulfillment within.]*
Return once more to *Pu* (the Uncarved).
*[One must return to the simplicity of the unadorned,
no longer adorned with artifice.]*

○ **Exegesis on *Nodes*:**
This means guarding naturalness.

*[Exegesis:]* *Pu* is the true origin.
From knowing *yang* to ultimately guarding humiliation,
these three methods of cultivation
are the essentials of the Dao.
Just as the empty valley contains all sounds,
so too does the constant Dao’s virtue
thus find fulfillment,
and one can return to true emptiness,
reverting to the wondrous origin.

*Pu* disperses into *qi* (vessels)—
*[Vessels mean use;
when the *Pu* of all things disperses,
it becomes functional.]*
The Dao disperses into the numinous,
flowing as the sun and moon,
manifesting as the Five Phases.
The Sage employs it,
and becomes the ruler of officials.
*[The Sage, ascending in use,
becomes the primal leader of all officials.]*
*[Commentary:]* When virtue is internally harmonized,
one returns to *Pu*.
When virtue is applied,
it disperses into *qi* (vessels).
Once engaged in form and function,
there must be refinement and coarseness—
thus, the Sage employs it to become the talents of the multitude and the leaders of officials.

*[Exegesis:]* Disperses means to distribute.
*Qi* means use.
*Officials* refers to the sovereign.
*Leaders* refers to teachers and masters.
Having returned to simplicity and restored purity,
reverting to the wondrous origin,
one must descend from the origin to benefit the people.
Spreading this purity and harmony as transformative use,
the *Xisheng Jing* says:
*The Dao thus disperses and distributes,
then becomes the ruler to govern the world,
the teacher to guide the customs.*
The Sage employs this *Pu*,
dispersing it into methods of governance and guidance.
Thus, the great measure knows no harm.
*[The Sage governs the world with the great Dao,
harming nothing;
governing the body with the great Dao,
harming no spirit.]*

*[Exegesis:]* The supreme Sage’s divine power is unimaginable,
subduing all within the Three Realms.
As the sovereign of vast universes,
they are called the *Great Measure*.
Yet they refine all beings,
molding life—
extending merit to things,
not ruling as a butcher.
Thus, it is said there is no harm.
*Harm* means to slaughter.

Desiring to take all under Heaven—
*[Desiring to become the sovereign of all under Heaven.]*
Yet to act—
*[Desiring to govern the people with deeds.]*
I see that this is unavoidable.
*[I see that this is contrary to the Dao and human nature—
the Dao abhors turmoil and filth,
human nature abhors excess desire.]*

*[Exegesis:]* When one is about to govern all under Heaven and transform the people,
one must empty the mind and forget desires.
If one governs with deeds,
the moment one attempts to transform,
one will fail—
and this failure is already evident.

All under Heaven is the divine vessel—
*[Vessel means thing;
humans are the divine things of all under Heaven.]*
The divine vessel loves tranquility,
and cannot be governed by deeds.

*[Exegesis:]* All sentient beings possess vitality,
all capable of receiving the Dao,
thus called the *divine vessel*.

The divine vessel is the **Imperial position**—
If one governs with **non-action** and tranquility,
then all beings and things flourish in harmony,
but if one governs with **deeds** and forced intervention,
then all sentient beings lose their **inherent nature**—
thus, it cannot be governed by deeds.

Those who **act** (with deeds) will **corrupt** it,
*[Exegesis:]* Forcing governance upon it will spoil its **natural simplicity**.
Those who **cling** will **lose** it.
*[Exegesis:]* If one rigidly enforces teachings,
one will **fail** to grasp its **true essence**,
giving rise to **deceit and falsehood**.

*[Exegesis:]* To stagnate and drown in **deeds** leads to **self-destruction and ruin**,
to fixate on desires and greed brings **loss of state and nation**.

Thus, things sometimes **operate by themselves** or **follow others**,
*[Exegesis:]* Whatever the **Sovereign** does,
the **subjects** will inevitably follow.

*[Exegesis:]* Things—**all things**—are uncertain.
Sometimes they **act by their own nature**,
sometimes they **conform to others**.
This illustrates that **authority and influence** are inherently unstable—
sometimes **one prevails**, sometimes **one falters**.

Sometimes they **warm**, sometimes they **chill**,
*[Exegesis:]* **Warm** (mild) and **chill** (harsh) are complementary.
Where there is warmth, there must be cold.
*[Exegesis:]* Warmness symbolizes **wealth and honor**,
coldness symbolizes **poverty and lowly status**.
Things may first be **wealthy and honored**, then **poor and lowly**,
just as the **scarlet summer** blazes with heat,
and the **dark winter** is piercing with cold.
The **Heavenly** alternates between **gentleness and severity**—
human fortunes of **wealth and honor** are equally transient.

Sometimes they **strengthen**, sometimes they **weaken**,
*[Exegesis:]* Where there is **strength**, there must be **frailty**.
---

「○ *Exegesis*: For great strength cannot endure long before decline—
thus the next chapter states, *"When things are at their peak, they grow old,"*
and the *Xi Sheng Jing* says: *"The flourishing must decline."*
This is the principle of **flourishing and decline being unstable**.

Sometimes they **settle**, sometimes they **peril**.
*[Exegesis:]* **Settle** means **stability**; **peril** means **danger**.
Where there is stability, there must be danger—
this illustrates that rulers must not act arbitrarily,
whether governing the state or cultivating the self.
○ *Exegesis*: The *He Shang* text originally renders *"or settle"* as *"or connect."*
**Connection** means continuity; **ruin** means decay.
Continuity and connection bring completion,
while decay brings ruin—
this demonstrates the instability of stability and danger.

Thus *Zhuangzi* says: *"What is completed is also destroyed."*
By enumerating these eight principles—
their instability reveals that all things are impermanent—
those who govern the state or cultivate the self
must not cling to rigid actions or fixed outcomes.

Therefore, the Sage **discards excess, extravagance, and excessiveness**.
*[Exegesis:]* **Excess** refers to greed for sounds and colors,
**extravagance** refers to carriages, attire, and drink,
**excessiveness** refers to official halls and pavilions.
By abandoning these three, one abides in **moderation**,
acts with **non-action (wuwei)**,
and the world transforms naturally.
○ *Exegesis*: The Sage, embracing the Dao, subtly embodies emptiness and falseness,
thus does not cling to the eight principles above,
but instead practices the three below:
Excess beautifies sounds and colors,
extravagance adorns garments and ornaments,
excessiveness expands halls and pavilions.
By removing these three delusions,
dwelling in the **central unity (zhongyi)**,
governing the state ensures enduring blessings,
cultivating the self ensures longevity and clear vision.

For those who **assist the ruler with the Dao**—
*[Exegesis:]* Meaning the ruler strengthens themselves with the Dao—
they do not **coerce the world with arms**.
*[Exegesis:]* By assisting the ruler with the Dao,
not relying on arms,
following the Dao and trusting in **virtue/power (de)**,
enemies submit naturally.
○ *Explanation*: This refers to—
the art of war itself.»

...when words err, arms must follow,
then **spirit (shen)** surges and **soul (hun)** and **vital essence (po)** combine,
**divine intelligence (shenming)** grows discontented and agitated—
then it abandons the body.

○ *[Exegesis:]* "以" means "to use."
"佐" means "to assist."
"人主" means "the sovereign/ruler."
Those who **use the Dao to assist the ruler**—
should **lay down arms and cultivate culture (yanshu xiuwen)**,
guide them with **virtue/power (de)**,
and not **overuse military force to coerce the world**.
The **internal wars of body and mind**—
that is, the **three afflictions (sanpo) and six senses (liujin)** as arms.
Their deeds return to themselves.
○ *[Exegesis:]* "好还" means—
when one steadies the heart and calms the will to act with **central unity (zhongyi)**,
this returns to their own person.

○ *[Exegesis:]* "还" means "return" or "recompense."
If one **uses external arms**,
and harbors resentment toward enemies within,
or **applies the three poisons (sanduo)** internally—
then they invite the **three sufferings (santuo)** as recompense.
This is inevitable,
hence it is said that their deeds return to themselves.

Where the **army (shi)** treads,
thorns and brambles grow.
○ *[Exegesis:]* Fields lie fallow, crops unplanted.

○ *[Exegesis:]* "师" means "army."
Where **warhorses and soldiers** march,
they harm people and destroy things—
only thorns and weeds sprout,
no grain grows.
It is the same as where the **desire-heart (yuxin)** roams unrestrained—
only evil deeds multiply,
no good fortune arises.

After a great army,
there must be years of calamity.
○ *[Exegesis:]* Heaven responds with **harmful qi (ezhiqi)**,
then the five grains are blighted,
the five grains exhausted—
then people suffer.

The **virtuous (shan)** act with **resolute sincerity (guo)**—
○ *[Exegesis:]* Those who practice goodness
should act with **resolute sincerity** alone,
that is, with **restraint (xiuxi)**.

○ *[Exegesis:]* "果" means "resolute."
"已" means "to cease."
The **cultivated Daoist** resolutely ceases
this violent heart and does not wield arms.

Do not **dare to take strength (qujiang)**—
○ *[Exegesis:]* Do not **dare to claim resolute sincerity** as a means to seize power.

**Resolute yet not arrogant (guo er wu ji)**—
○ *[Exegesis:]* **Resolute yet humble**, not boasting of oneself.

**Resolute yet not self-praising (guo er wu fa)**—
○ *[Exegesis:]* **Resolute yet self-effacing**, not seizing glory for oneself.

**Resolute yet not proud (guo er wu jiao)**—
○ *[Exegesis:]* "骄" means "to bully."
**Resolute yet not bullying others.**

**Resolute yet not forced (guo er wu deyi)**—
○ *[Exegesis:]* **Resolute yet utterly sincere**, not acting under coercion or compulsion.

○ *[Exegesis:]* "骄" means **to disrespect superiors (mangshang)**,
"矜" means **to boast before inferiors (kuaxia)**.
The **cultivated Daoist** must **practice modesty (qianxun)** and **yielding (ran)**,
not **seizing strength or violence (ziquiangbao)**,
nor **bullying or arrogating power (mangkuai)**.
They must also **avoid self-aggrandizement (jiakuang)** toward things,
not **boasting before inferiors (kuaxia)**.
"伐" means "to take."
**They must acknowledge others' worth (tuirenzhiwu)**,
not **seize glory for oneself (ziqui)**.
Those who act under compulsion—
like **Emperor Yao (Yao Di) attacking Zhongzhi (Congzhi)**,
or **Yu the Great attacking Youxu (Youxu)**—
these were deeds not of their own choosing,
not **delighting in war or conquest (lebingfa)**.
"勿强" means—
before the **knotted cords (jiehuang)** era,
**resolute sincerity** was the **determined cessation of arms**.

This is **resolute yet not strong (guo er wujiang)**—
○ *[Exegesis:]* **Resolute yet not relying on arms or fortified might (qujiangbianjia)** to oppress others.**

○ *[Exegesis:]* When enemies invade,
if one **acts under compulsion**,
then they **use arms to repel them**—
but this is **resolute in response to aggression (guoyingdi)**,
not **resolute in seizing strength (guoqujiang)**.

○ *[Exegesis:]* "物壮则老" means—
when **plants and trees reach their peak (zhuangji)**,
they wither and fall,
and when **people reach their peak (zhuangji)**,
they grow decrepit and old.

○ *[Exegesis:]* Those who **overuse strength** cannot endure long.
○ *[Exegesis:]* Just as **extreme heat must give way to cold (yanji zeleng)**,
this is the **constant principle of nature (lizhihengshu)**.
When **plants and trees reach their peak (zhuangji)**,
they wither and fall—
this is an inevitable truth.

○ *[Exegesis:]* This is called **"not the Dao (bu dao)"**—
○ *[Exegesis:]* Those who **wither and fall** are those who **sit idle, not practicing the Dao**.
○ *[Exegesis:]* Those who **do not practice the Dao** will **perish early**.
○ *"已" means "death."*

○ *[Exegesis:]* When **plants and trees reach their peak (zhuangji)**,
they wither and fall—
when **arms grow strong (bingjiang)**,
they bring decline.
Since they **do not practice modesty and yielding (buqianran)**,
they are **not true Daoists (feizhendao)**—
they must **cease and desist (zhiqi)**,
not **persist in such ways**.

Now, **fine arms (jia bing)**—
are **inauspicious instruments (bu xiang zhiqi)**—
○ *[Exegesis:]* "祥" means "good."
Arms **disturb the spirit (jing shen)** and **muddy harmonious qi (zhuo heqi)**,
they are **not good instruments (bu shan zhiqi)**,
and should not be **cultivated or adorned (bu dang xiu shi)**.

○ *[Exegesis:]* "佳" means "ornate."
"祥" means "good."
Though **frosted spears and dazzling halberds (shuangegeliangri)**,
or **jewelled swords gleaming in the sky (baojianhuangtian)**,
these are **tools of calamity (cong huang zhiwu)**,
not **instruments of peace (fei tai ping zhiqi)**.
Internally, they are the **arms of the three poisons and six senses (sanpo liujin zhi bing)**—
if one **sharpened the senses (moxi liujin)**,
yet **greedily took from the dusty world (qianqu chenjing)**—
these are **not good deeds (bu shan zhi xing)**.

○ *[Exegesis:]* Things **often turn against those who wield them (wu huo e zhi)**—
○ *[Exegesis:]* When arms are **used, they bring harm (bingdong zhi you hai)**,
so **all things (wanwu)** hold no good fortune for them.
Thus, **those who practice the Dao do not dwell there**.

○ *[Exegesis:]* The **gentle and yielding (zhi)** are **valued in peace (gui zuo)**,
while **strength and force (gangqiang)** are **valued in war (gui you)**—
this shows that the **Dao of war (bingdao)** and the **Dao of the gentleman (junzidao)** are opposed,
and what is **valued differs**.

○ *[Exegesis:]* With **virtue and moral character (junzi renwu zhi de)**,
one is a **gentleman (junzi)**.
The **left (zuo)** is **yang (yang)**—
**bringing auspiciousness and life (zhu sheng)**.
The **right (you)** is **yin (yin)**—
**bringing inauspiciousness and death (zhu xiangsi)**.
When the **gentleman dwells in a peaceful age (pingju zhi shi)**,
they **value the left (yongwen)** and **cultivate culture (xiuwen)**,
while in **times of chaos and disorder (huangluan zhi shi)**,
they **value the right (yongwu)** and **employ arms (bing)**.
This illustrates that **true wisdom (ren shizhi)** values **longevity (changsheng)**,
but **tactical wisdom (quan zhi)** sometimes must **kill (shou shi)**—
hence the scripture says:
**"Thousand upon thousand are beheaded,
million upon million are dismembered."**

○ *[Exegesis:]* "兵者，不祥之器" means—
○ *[Exegesis:]* "非君子之器" means—
arms are **not instruments the gentleman cherishes**.

○ *[Exegesis:]* The **gentleman relies on virtue and moral character (daode)** as their **talents and tools (caiqi)**,
not on **military strategy (bingmou)**.

○ *[Exegesis:]* "阴强则杀身之斧也" means—
**when strength is used in darkness (yinqiang)**,
it becomes the **axe that slays oneself (shashen zhi fu)**.
Hence it is said that **arms are inauspicious instruments**.

When **arms are used under compulsion (bu deyi er yong)**—
○ *[Exegesis:]* When **facing decline and ruin (shao feng huangui)**,
and **desiring to protect the people (yuxia wanmin)**,
one **uses them to defend oneself (yongzhi yizhi)**.

○ *[Exegesis:]* Arms are **not instruments of the gentleman or the virtuous (fei junzi shanren zhiqi)**,
but they **must be used to pacify evil and rescue the afflicted (bixiang qiannan)**,
and **cannot be stopped (bu de zhi)**—
even **tactical wisdom (quan zhi)** must act thus.

**Serenity and simplicity (tian dan)** are the highest.

**Translation:**

**Annotations:**—
**When victory is obtained, yet beauty (mei) is not deemed advantageous.**
○ *Exegesis:* **Serenity and non-action (tian dan wuwei) are the highest.**
The **gentleman’s heart** values **non-action (wuwei)**,
hence **using arms is not considered beautiful (mei).**

**It is likened to the traveler**—
though **tactical wisdom (quan zhi)** is employed,
**true Dao/Way (zhidao)** must be held supreme,
and **action should not stray from sincerity (zhen).**

**If one finds beauty in it, then one delights in killing.**
○ *Exegesis:* **If one takes fine arms as beautiful (mei),**
it is **the love of war and slaughter (aile gan gē) that kills.**
**For those who delight in killing cannot achieve their ambitions in the world.**
○ *Exegesis:* **As a ruler, to delight in killing—**
this **cannot be tolerated by the world (tianxia gongji)**,
for **calamities (weiyue)** are many,
and **one cannot fulfill their desires (bu de yi).**
Hence, **one should not arbitrarily execute punishments (bu de màng xing).**

○ *Exegesis:* **The rites of mourning are held on the left (shang zuo),**
**for the left governs life and position (shengwei).**
**Evil is held on the right (shang you),**
**for darkness (yin) governs killing.**

**The lesser general (pianjiangjun) is stationed on the left,**
○ *Exegesis:* **The lesser general is humble and occupies a bright position (yangwei),**
**for they do not specialize in killing.**
○ *One Family’s Commentary:* **The general is one in essence,**
but **names vary with their duties (dongjing yiming).**
When **still, they attend in residence (shizhi shi ju),**
hence they are called **lesser (pian).**

**The greater general (shangjiangjun) is stationed on the right,**
○ *Exegesis:* **The greater general, in their exalted position on the right,**
**holds authority over killing (zhi zhu sha),**
**for they wield threats and punishments (dongyong weixing),**
**and assume command outside the gates (qimen zhuan sha),**
**acting by **self-tasked Dao/Way (ziran zhi dao)****,
hence they are called **greater (shang).**
**Though they are supreme, they dwell on the right,**
**for killing belongs to darkness (yin).**
**This is likened to the rites of mourning.**
○ *Exegesis:* **The greater general on the right—**
**funeral rites are also placed on the right,**
**for the dead are honored in darkness (yin).**
○ *Commentary:* **Left is the auspicious position (jwei),**
**right is the mourning position (sangwei).**
**Now, the lesser general is placed on the left,**
**while the greater general is stationed on the right,**
**to show that though they hold authority over life and death,**
**they are treated with the solemnity of funeral rites (sangli).**

**When many are killed, one mourns with sorrow and weeping,**
○ *Exegesis:* **The harm to one’s own virtue (de) is thin,**
**unable to transform others with Dao/Way (bu de yidao hua ren),**
**yet harming the innocent (wu gui zhi ren).**
○ *Exegesis:* **With the reverence for living beings (shengling zhi gui),**
**yet war causes slaughter,**
**one feels pity (cexin zhi xin),**
**hence they mourn with sorrow and weeping.**
○ *Commentary:* **In battle, destruction and slaughter are inevitable,**
**so the greater general mourns with sorrow,**
**pitying the wounded and slain,**
**not because they employ Dao/Way,**
**but fearing that innocent lives may be recklessly harmed.**
**One man’s lament is called "呼嗟" (huxie),**
**the enemy is "敌人" (diren),**
**and the many are the soldiers (shizu).**
**The harm to one’s own virtue is thin,**
**yet unable to transform others with Dao/Way,**
**and harming the innocent—**
**then the heart is filled with sorrow and pity,**
**and they weep,**
**making clear that they do not delight in it.**

○ *Exegesis:* **One soldier’s lament (yifu huxie) causes the Dao/Way to falter.**
**One village’s discord (yili weihe) alters the harmony of yin and yang.**
**Zou Yan’s frost (Zou Yan jiangshuang) descends,**
**and the walls of Qí’s wife (Qici cheng hui) are destroyed,**
**even commoners and ordinary women (pifu limifu)**
**feel the shifts of heaven and earth,**
**how much more so when**
**corpses sprawl across vast plains (hengshi juyě),**
**bones scatter along the rivers (sangǔ chángyuán),**
**flesh is fed to carrion birds (rouci wuyuan),**
**and blood flows over crimson grass (xue liu jiangcao)?**
**Pitying the mutilated and wounded—**
**how could one not grieve?**

**Victory in battle is treated with funeral rites.**
○ *Exegesis:* **In ancient times, when victorious in war,**
**the general occupied the mourning master’s position (sangzhu zhi wei),**
**wearing plain garments and weeping,**
**to show that the gentleman values virtue (de) over arms (bing),**
**and though compelled to punish inauspicious acts (bu xiang zhu sha),**
**their heart does not rejoice in it,**
**comparing it to mourning (bi yu sang).**
**Knowing that future generations will not cease from using arms,**
**hence they mourn with sorrow and pain.**
○ *Exegesis:* **The brave warrior enters battle and gains victory,**
**victory brings them rank,**
**yet the right is not auspicious—**
**hence they are treated with funeral rites.**
**But if arms are merely regarded as inauspicious instruments,**
**why then must they don plain garments as a sign of mourning?**

○ *Commentary:* **The gentleman and the virtuous (junzi shanren)**
**value the ability to employ Dao/Way.**
**When matters cannot be avoided (shi bu de yi),**
**they are then treated with funeral rites.**
**Though martial prowess is inferior to cultural refinement (wu bu ji wen),**
**it clearly shows that expedience (quan) is inferior to principle (shi).**
**In governing the state, one must use force when compelled (bu de yi yong wu),**
**and employ expedience when necessary (bu de yi xing quan),**
**by this standard of measure,**
**one knows that expedience is weaker than principle.**

**Dao/Way is always nameless.**
○ *Exegesis:* **Dao/Way can be dark (yin) or bright (yang),**
**can relax or tighten,**
**can preserve or perish,**
**hence it has no fixed name.**
○ *Exegesis:* **Dao/Way’s application is its constancy (yongyong wei chang),**
**constancy can respond to all things,**
**yet its response is not of human making,**
**hence it is said that Dao/Way is always nameless.**
○ *Commentary:* **The principle of empty and boundless harmony (xutong zhi li)**
**is always still and settled (chang zhan ningran),**
**neither form nor sound,**
**without name or character.**
**Silent and solitary, it transcends the four extremes (chao si ju zhi duan),**
**dim and elusive (huanghuo xiyi),**
**separate from all contrariness (li bai fei zhi wai),**
**how could it be sought through words and symbols (bi yu yin xiang qiu)?**
**How could one measure it with the mind’s intelligence (an yong xin zhi ce)?**
**Hence the following text says,**
*"Heaven and earth began..."*
**and again,**
*"I do not know its name."*

**Though unadorned simplicity (pǔ) is small,**
**none under heaven dares to serve it as a subject.** #1

「Commentary:
The Dao/Way is simple and unadorned though small,
subtle and formless beyond measure—
none under heaven dares to subject it as a lord.

○ *御 says:* "Simple" refers to the wondrous, singular origin,
hence it is called *small*.
Yet when it manifests and fulfills its function,
it becomes supremely vast—
thus none dare to make the Dao/Way their subject.

○ *Cū says:* "Simple" means pure and unadorned.
"Small" means subtly profound.
The simple Dao, though in its own fineness,
can cultivate yin and yang,
order the myriad things,
and sustain the daily lives of the people—
yet they remain unaware,
and none dare to claim it as their own.
Again it is said:
*"Things have no high or low—
the Dao is present, and thus it is honored."*
Thus, the recluses—Púchū, Xùyóu, Wángnǎi, and Nièquē—
these sages,
though reduced to poverty as common folk,
were never subjects of the Son of Heaven
nor friends of the feudal lords—
this is their very essence.

If lords and kings could uphold it,
all things would come of their own accord in submission.

Commentary:
If lords and kings could guard the Dao/Way and act without contrivance,
all things would spontaneously submit and follow its virtue.

○ *Cū says:* When a ruler aligns with the Dao’s virtue
and harmonizes with the order of yin and yang,
then the four seasons proceed like jade candles,
the seven luminaries move without fault,
and auspicious signs—strange plants, sweet dew—
abound, leaving no want in the land.
How could this not be so?
The people need no command to be naturally balanced.

Commentary:
*Balanced* means harmonious.
*None* means without.
When virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth,
and clarity unites the three luminaries,
the people require no edicts—
they are spontaneously at peace.
The power of the Dao is beyond reckoning;
its guardianship brings such benefits.

When the Dao first established names,
Commentary:
*The Dao* refers to the Way,
*names* to the myriad things.
The nameless Dao governs the named,
the formless governs the formed.

○ *Cū says:* The named arises from the nameless,
the named illuminates the nameless—
only then can one guide the lost
and lead them to awakening.

When names have already been established,
Commentary:
*Exhausted* means fully realized.
When the named things are complete in their desires,
they rebel against the Dao and forsake virtue,
and thus bring ruin upon themselves.

Heaven too will know when to stop,
Commentary:
If one follows the Dao and practices virtue,
Heaven itself will know when to cease.

○ *Cū says:* The Dao has no designation,
yet it descends to establish names—
its intent is to guide beings toward their true path,
returning them to their root.
Once the metaphor is understood,
one must cease clinging to names
and seek the reality beyond—
lest one be ensnared by the snare,
losing sight of fish and hare alike.

Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.

Commentary:
To know when to stop is to invite the aid of the numinous—
then there is no longer danger.

○ *Cū says:* Once the snare is forgotten,
the subtle truth is attained.
When names converge with reality,
there is no peril.

The Dao/Way in the world is like rivers and valleys to the sea.
Commentary:
The Dao/Way in the world,
harmonizing with all things,
is like rivers and valleys flowing into the sea.

○ *Cū says:* The sea excels in receiving all rivers—
the Sage’s emptiness receives all beings.
Thus it is said:
*"The sea is king of the rivers because it excels in descending."*

To know people is wisdom,
Commentary:
To discern people’s likes and dislikes—
this is wisdom.

○ *Cū says:* To perceive the nature of others—discerning their subtleties, whether profound or shallow—without failing to know them fully: this is *other-heart wisdom*. To know oneself is clarity.

*Commentary:* When one knows their own virtues and flaws, this is *listening in silence* and *gazing inward without form*—thus it is called clarity.

○ *Yuè says:* The wise employ their intelligence to discern things, while the enlightened illuminate subtleties with radiant insight. Intelligence may have its limits, but enlightenment knows no bounds.

○ *Cū says:* To know one’s past lives—both merit and sin—and the retributions of the three ages with perfect clarity: this is *host-fate wisdom*.

To overcome others is strength,
*Commentary:* Those who overcome others do so only through coercive power.

○ *Cū says:* Intelligence and strength overcome others; might subdues beings. Thus one subdues celestial demons and eliminates heterodox paths—this is *subduing-demons wisdom*.

○ *Gù says:* Talent and capability may overcome others, but strength alone is fleeting. Those with strength must have adversaries. If one has adversaries, strength is not yet absolute. But to master one’s nature and temper emotions—that is *self-overcoming*. Those who overcome themselves have no rival within themselves, and thus may be called truly strong.

*Self-overcoming is strength.*
*Commentary:* When one conquers their own desires, none in the world can contend with them—thus they are strong.

○ *Yuè says:* Those who can conquer others are merely strong in power. But those who conquer their own hearts, softening them, alone preserve their true strength.

○ *Cū says:* To subdue one’s own mind, to master all entangling desires—when desires no longer arise, wisdom grows ever stronger: this is *severing-delusion wisdom*.

To know contentment is wealth,
*Commentary:* When one knows sufficiency as sufficiency, they preserve fortune and blessing eternally—thus they are wealthy.

○ *Cū says:* To guard one’s portion and know contentment is not merely to avoid poverty in wealth, but to be rich in virtue and morality. Further, to discern presence and absence—when all realms are illuminated, wisdom knows no lack, and thus is called *wealth*—this is *contentment wisdom*.

To act with vigor is resolve.
*Commentary:* When one exerts strength in doing good, they are said to have resolve in the Dao, and the Dao responds in kind.

○ *Jié says:* To practice the Dao without rest, day and night.

○ *Yuè says:* Those who know contentment lack greed—thus they are wealthy. Those who act with vigor never falter—thus they possess resolve and principle.

○ *Cū says:* *Resolve* is principle. When resolve is strong, great vows arise—prioritizing others over self, sacrificing one’s life to benefit beings, even in the final moments, never retreating.

To never lose one’s place is longevity.
*Commentary:* When one preserves their vital essence, cherishing the heavens’ refined *qi*, they endure.

○ *Jié says:* To never lose one’s singular essence.

○ *Cū says:* Responding to circumstances with appropriate remedies, administering medicine to suit each ailment—all in perfect accord, never straying from what is fitting. Thus, in interacting with beings, one remains enduring and unyielding.

To die yet not perish is longevity.
*Commentary:* Eyes do not gaze wantonly, ears do not listen indiscriminately, the mouth does not speak recklessly—thus no resentment lingers in the world, and one attains true longevity.

○ *Jié says:* Referring to those who achieve *corpse dissolution*—dying only to be reborn.

○ *Cū says:* When both deeds and vows are complete, inner and outer paths aligned, logically there should be no death or birth, no untimely end or extended life. Yet it is said, *"To die yet not perish"*—to clarify that death is not true death, and non-longevity is true longevity. The body may depart, but the Sage’s essence remains unchanged—thus it is called *longevity*.

○ *Yuè says:* Death is the end of one’s appointed fate; perishing is the reversal of heaven’s will; longevity is the fulfillment of one’s allotted span. To know others and overcome them invites calamity, but contentment and vigor align with the natural order. To die yet not perish—this is the completion of one’s span, and thus may be called *longevity*.

The Great Dao is boundless,
*Commentary:* The Dao is vast, like floating and sinking, presence and absence—visible yet unseen, spoken yet indistinct.

○ *Yuè says:* The Great Dao is boundless, unrestrained yet responsive to all things, neither favoring left nor right.

Its left and right are boundless.
*Commentary:* The Dao can turn left or right, fitting all circumstances.

○ *Cū says:* *Boundless* means unrestrained, also universal. The Dao is empty and mysterious, boundless in compassion, responding as it is moved—though neither yin nor yang, it adapts to left and right, revealing that square and round conform to things, exhausting all possibilities without fail. Hence *Zhuangzi* says: *"There is left and right, there is right and wrong."*

All things rely on it to live,
Yet it does not decline.
*Commentary:* All things depend on the Dao for existence, yet it never refuses or resists.

○ *Cū says:* All things rely on the ultimate Dao for their formation, compassionately saving and guiding, never weary of effort. Further, things themselves do not decline—they arise naturally.

Its achievements are unnamed.
*Commentary:* The Dao does not claim credit for its accomplishments.

○ *Yuè says:* All things rely on the harmonious *qi* of the Dao for transformation, yet the Dao does not decline in its labor. When its functions are complete, it does not claim ownership.

○ *Cū says:* It nurtures all forms of life, its subtle work unseen, yet its merit is attributed to the things themselves—thus it does not claim the name of achievement.

It clothes all things yet is not their master—
This may be called *small*.
*Commentary:* The Dao, though nurturing all things, does not rule like a sovereign.

○ *Yuè says:* *Clothing* is akin to nurturing.

○ *Cū says:* It clothes all beings, molding life—yet its divine function remains hidden, not assuming mastery. Humbling itself before things, it is rightly called *small*—though not truly small, but *small in name*.

All things return to it yet it does not rule—
This may be called *great*.
*Commentary:* The Dao is vast as the empty sea, where all rivers converge. It does not rule as a sovereign—its meaning has been explained before. Since all things turn to the Dao, it rightly bears the name of *great*—though not truly great, but *great in name*.

Thus, the Sage never claims greatness,
*Commentary:* The Sage follows the Dao, concealing virtue and hiding renown, not indulging in grandiosity.
And so achieves true greatness.
*Commentary:* The Sage embodies the Dao, acting without speech yet transforming all things, and thus attains true greatness.
*Yuè says:* The Sage follows the Dao and forgets merit, never seeking to magnify itself, and so achieves true greatness.
*Cū says:* The Sage who embodies the Dao forgets self for things, retreats in stillness and humility, never claiming greatness—only prioritizing others over self, forgetting merit and greatness. Thus, it becomes the leader of all beings, alone holding the highest honor in the Three Realms, and attains true greatness.

Holding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven turns toward it.
*Commentary:* *Holding* means upholding. *Symbol* refers to the Dao. The Sage upholds the Great Dao, and thus all people align their hearts and turn toward it. Governing the self, Heaven sends divine clarity, coming and going within it.
*Cū says:* *Holding* means to grasp, yet it is grasping without grasping, grasping nothing. The Great Symbol is like the law of the Great Dao—just as the Sage who forgets greatness upholds the formless Great Symbol, always benefiting things, making all under Heaven turn toward it.
As in *Zhuangzi*: "Wang Dai stood without teaching, sat without ruling, empty in departure, full in return." Confucius led all under Heaven to turn toward him.
Coming and going without harm,
It brings peace, stability, and harmony.
*Commentary:* When all things turn without harm, the realm is secure, families are at peace, and great harmony prevails. Governing the self without harming the divine, the body remains secure and long-lived.
*Yuè says:* Things turn without harm, and thus dwell in great peace.
*Cū says:* *Great* means vast. The common people turn to the most sagely, all gaining benefit without loss. The benefit they gain is the law of peace and stability. Without harm, it reveals the removal of suffering; peace and stability speak of sharing in joy.

Joy and delicacies—
The passing traveler stops.
*Commentary:* *Delicacies* means beauty. The traveler is one. If one takes delight in the Dao’s beauty, they will stop and stay.
One is the absence of excess, dwelling in emptiness, like a passing traveler.

The Dao, when spoken of, is without taste.
*Commentary:* The Dao, entering and exiting the mouth, is insipid—unlike the five flavors of sour, salty, bitter, sweet, and spicy.
*Cū says:* The utmost Dao is empty and silent, its essence subtle and elusive. Thus, its speech is insipid and without allure, unlike music or fine foods that delight the senses. Music has sounds to please, delicacies have flavors to nourish—what is pleasing and satisfying makes even passing travelers stop and linger. But the Dao’s speech is insipid, and few scholars pause to reflect.

Ah, how deeply the world’s folly is obscured!
They can indulge in pleasing sounds,
Yet who can savor the tasteless taste?

It cannot be seen when gazed upon,
*Commentary:* *Sufficient* means attainment. The Dao is formless—unlike the five colors of blue, yellow, red, white, and black that can be perceived.
*Cū says:* The utmost Dao is profound and dark, transcending form and color. Unlike worldly teachings, it cannot be recognized by the eyes.

It cannot be heard when listened to,
*Commentary:* The Dao is unlike the five tones—*gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*—that can be heard.
*Cū says:* The great sound is subtle and without pitch. It is not like the tones of *gong* and *shang*, nor can it be heard like bells and drums. The Sage’s speech follows this same principle.

Its use cannot be exhausted.
*Commentary:* Using the Dao to govern the realm brings wealth and prosperity to the people; governing the self extends life—there is no end to its use.
*Yuè says:* With the Dao in stillness, there is no need for spoken instruction. Thus, it cannot be seen, cannot be heard. Pure winds prevail, all things flourish abundantly, and each year’s harvests overflow—so its use cannot be exhausted. *Exhausted* means finished.
*Cū says:* The utmost Dao’s words are insipid and distant, neither sound nor color, transcending sight and hearing. Like a mirror’s reflection, things come and it responds; like the Sage’s wisdom, it responds intuitively. Thus, the use of the non-use is difficult to exhaust.

When one would gather it,
One must first disperse it;
*Commentary:* First, one opens and disperses to indulge in extreme decadence.
*Cū says:* *Gather* means to contract, to restrain. To enact governance and transform all things, making them contract and not be corrupted by luxury, one must first open and indulge them, pushing them to extreme decadence. This was how Laozi, upon entering the Western Regions, first allowed their fierce and unrestrained nature to flourish before transforming them with the Dao.

When one would weaken it,
One must first strengthen it;
*Commentary:* First strengthening it is to invite disaster.
*Cū says:* To make them return to the Dao’s gentle weakness, one must first push them to extreme strength, then guide them toward yielding softness.

When one would abolish it,
One must first establish it;
*Commentary:* First establishing it is to let their arrogance and excess reach danger.
*Cū says:* To abolish their brutality, one must first indulge their ferocity. Once their ferocity reaches its peak, it can be abolished.

When one would take from it,
One must first give to it.
*Commentary:* First giving to it is to indulge their greed.

The *Cū* says:
To indulge their evil first is called *giving* to them.
Later, to make them return to the Dao and goodness is called *taking* from them.
Thus, the Old Master first revealed the common and confused,
So as to indulge their obstinate and perverse nature.
Later, when they witnessed the divine transformations,
The wicked were subdued, and only then could their ferocity be taken away,
And they were led back to the virtuous Dao.
These four paired principles share similar logic—
Only differing in that the initial is shallow and the latter profound.

Those of superior capacity, upon hearing the truth, immediately awaken.
Those of inferior capacity require reliance on expedient means—
This is the *Increased Treatment of the Profound*.
This is called *subtle clarity*.

*Commentary:* These four matters—
Their Dao is subtle, yet their effects are clear.

*Yuè* says:
The Classic states: *"True speech seems contrary."*
The *Yì* says: *"Compliance to act with expedience."*
Expedience is contrary to the Classic yet harmonizes with principle.
Thus, the noble employ expedience when it aligns with principle,
While the petty use it for deceit and guile.
Confucius said: *"One may entrust them with uprightness, but not with expedience."*
Indeed.

Thus, the Old Master in the previous chapter demonstrated the Great Image—
This is called *truth*.
This chapter follows with contraction and expansion—
This is called *expedience*.
To measure the roots of sentient beings,
He thus demonstrated both expedience and truth,
Reversing appearances to reveal essence,
So that they must attain the realm of life and fate.
Yet the deluded claim this is not the intent of the Dao and its virtue—
How deeply they err and fail to awaken!

When one seeks to contract and restrain the desires of sentient beings,
First expand them, indulging their extravagant hearts,
So that they become ensnared in love and desire—
Then contraction and restraint may follow.
The principles of strength and weakness are similarly applied.
This Dao is exceedingly subtle, yet its effects are clearly manifest—
Hence it is called *subtle clarity*.

The *Cū* says:
Though the expedient Dao above is subtle and profound,
Its verification is nonetheless evident.
Gentleness and weakness overcome rigidity and strength.

*Commentary:* Gentleness and weakness endure,
While rigidity and strength perish.

The *Cū* says:
Gentleness and weakness are *true wisdom*,
Rigidity and strength are *expedient wisdom*.
To teach and transform sentient beings,
One must employ expedient wisdom.
In definitive terms, *true wisdom* prevails.

Fish cannot be removed from the depths,
*Commentary:* Fish removed from the depths
Gain softness by losing rigidity—
They can no longer be controlled.

A state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to the people.
*Commentary:* Sharp tools refer to the expedient Dao.
Those who wield state expedience must not reveal it to officials,
And those who practice the Dao of self-cultivation
Must not reveal it to the unworthy.

The *Cū* says:
*Detachment* means *loss*.
Sharp tools are *authority*.
Fish hidden in water, expedience concealed in the heart—
Thus nothing harms them.
Fish lost from water are seized by others,
Expedience revealed to others is controlled by others—
Hence it must not be shown to others.

*Volume Four of the Annotations on the Dao De Jing*
Narrated by the *Chéngshì* of Wú Commandery, *Gù Huān*.

The Dao is ever without action yet without failing to act.
*Commentary:* The Dao is always without action.
*Exegesis:* The Dao of profound stillness is quiescent and without action, yet from its essence arises function, responding to things and transforming them—hence it is said to be without failing to act. The first sentence is the root, the second the manifestation; this clarifies root and manifestation, the interplay of stillness and motion.

*Cai* says: The Dao’s essence is congealed and still, its true realm unmoving—hence it is said to be without action. Yet it responds to things and moves; nothing is left unused—hence it is said to be without failing to act. If lords and kings could uphold it, all things would spontaneously transform.
*Commentary:* If lords and kings could uphold the Dao, all things would spontaneously transform, benefiting themselves.
*Yu* says: The wondrous root is pure and pristine, hence always without action. Things rely on it to thrive, yet it is without failing to act. If lords and kings could uphold the Dao’s non-action, all things would spontaneously transform. The ruler’s non-action brings the world to simplicity and purity.
*Exegesis:* Even sovereigns of ten thousand chariots, rulers of the five ranks—if they could uphold this Dao, the eight extremes and myriad lands would naturally follow its transformation. The same applies to commoners. The reason this passage emphasizes lords and kings is to show that rulers lead transformation, benefiting and expanding for all.
*Du* says: Virtue can subdue things; the Dao is present, and thus the sovereign is honored. Kings who uphold the Dao do not command—yet all is balanced. Dukes and marquises embrace virtue without severity, yet all is transformed.
*Luo* (Rushen) *Inner Explanation* says: The mind attains emptiness yet does not lose its resources; all spirits follow transformation, and evil is subdued, returning to the right path.

When transformation stirs to act, I shall restrain it with the nameless Primal Simplicity.
*Commentary:* "I" refers to the self; the nameless Primal Simplicity is the Dao. All things transform, benefiting themselves.
*Yu* says: When people have followed the ruler’s transformation—non-action, pure and pristine—and yet still desire to act and do, I shall restrain them with the nameless Primal Simplicity, which is the Dao.
*Exegesis:* "Act" means to begin cultivation. "Primal Simplicity" is the Dao. It says that when beings first begin cultivation, they must have desires for fruition. Once such desires arise, one must settle their mind with the nameless, pristine Dao, so that it is not stained by the worldly—this is to dispel the "having" with the "non."
*Gu* says: "Act" means deceit arises. It says that when a lord upholds the Dao, all things follow transformation, yet someone from within this harmony might harbor deceitful intentions. The Master says, "I shall restrain them with the Dao." Again: "Make their hearts chaotic, so that there is no distinction." Again: "The nameless Primal Simplicity is instruction." The nameless Primal Simplicity also does not desire; not desiring is stillness.
*Commentary:* It says that when a ruler restrains with virtue and the Dao, the people will also not desire, hence one must guide them with purity and stillness.
*Exegesis:* Not only must one not desire the "having" of laws, but one must also not desire the "non" of this nameless purity. Earlier, the "non" dispelled the "having"; now, the "non" dispels the "non." Having and non are both dispelled, departing from the single Middle Way. The world will then spontaneously rectify itself.
*Commentary:* Stillness is cessation. Earlier, the nameless dispelled the having; next, not desiring dispelled the non. Having and non having are both dispelled, not desiring is then extinguished, and not desiring removed, the single Middle is effaced. This is dispelling again and again, the mysterious beyond the mysterious—what is called probing the subtle, seeking the hidden, exhausting principle, and perfecting nature. Then all dharmas are without exception true and genuine; even weeds and tiles are all the utmost Dao—hence it is said the world spontaneously rectifies itself. This one sentence seals the gate of all mysteries.
*Yu* says: The nameless Primal Simplicity also does not desire—it says that when the ruler has restrained with the nameless Primal Simplicity, the common people must not cling to this namelessness, lest they seek to advance and lose their root, falling back into action. Hence, even this nameless Primal Simplicity must be forgotten. Not desiring desire, not desiring is also forgotten—pure and pristine, the world spontaneously rectifies itself.
Again: The Dao is ever without desire, delighting in purity, hence it makes heaven and earth ever rectified. Heaven and earth are the Dao’s subjects; when the ruler follows the Dao and issues precepts, the hearts of all subjects will spontaneously rectify.

The highest virtue does not claim virtue, hence it has virtue;
*Commentary:* The highest virtue refers to the ancient sovereign without name—his virtue is great yet unnamed, hence it is called highest virtue. "Not claiming virtue" means he does not teach virtue to the people; he follows nature, nurturing human life and vitality, his virtue unseen—hence it is said he does not claim virtue. It says his virtue aligns with heaven and earth, harmonious *qi* flowing, and the people are thereby preserved.
*Exegesis:* "Highest" means elevated, a name for transcendence. "Virtue" means attainment, with the sense of achieving. It says those of highest virtue intuitively grasp the Dao’s realm; their insight is obscure yet unified, attainment and loss both forgotten. Attainment and loss forgotten—hence it is said they do not claim virtue. Insight obscure yet unified—hence it is said they have virtue. Having virtue dispels loss; not claiming virtue dispels attainment.

The lower virtue does not lose virtue, hence it has no virtue.
*Commentary:* The lower virtue refers to the named sovereign—his virtue does not reach that of the highest, hence it is called lower virtue. "Not losing virtue" means his virtue is visible, his deeds praiseworthy. Since he bears a name and title, it is said he has no virtue.
The highest virtue acts without action, yet there is nothing it does not act upon;
*Commentary:* It says the Dao’s law is tranquil, without contrivance, hence there is no need for a name.
*Exegesis:* "Act upon" means to use. The highest virtue acts without action, reaching the root of congealed stillness, yet its manifestation is empty and wondrous—this is called non-action yet action; action is precisely non-action.

The lower virtue acts with contrivance, yet there is something it does act upon.
*Commentary:* It speaks of a sovereign who enforces teachings and policies, all for his own sake, and claims a name for himself. ○*Exegesis:* Since his heart does not forget virtue, he is called "for it." Yet he still has affairs to attend to, hence it is said he acts with contrivance.

The highest virtue acts with benevolence, yet there is nothing it does not transcend.
*Commentary:* The highest virtue refers to a sovereign who practices benevolence without equal, hence it is called the highest virtue. "Acts with benevolence" means to extend compassion. When deeds are accomplished and affairs established, there is nothing to cling to as a means. ○*Exegesis:* Benevolence is compassion—it arises from a mind of nurturing. Since he does not value reciprocal kindness, it is said he transcends contrivance. Though the highest virtue is not as profound as the lower virtue, in terms of moral rectitude, benevolence surpasses it, hence it is called "transcend contrivance." Within the Three Jewels, compassion is paramount, so among the Five Virtues, benevolence is also placed first.

The highest righteousness acts with contrivance, yet there is something it does act upon.
*Commentary:* It acts with righteousness to sever and cut away—his actions are for his own sake, killing to establish his authority, taxing the people to sustain his own indulgence. ○*Exegesis:* Righteousness upholds the correction of evil and the punishment of wrongdoing, as seen in the scriptures’ precepts and disciplines. Yet the essence of these precepts, when applied to lower beings, still involves contrivance; they have not yet reached the realm of empty and wondrous non-action, hence it is said he acts with contrivance.

The highest propriety acts, yet none respond to it.
*Commentary:* It refers to a sovereign whose propriety is without equal. "Acts" means to establish rites, institutions, and ceremonial authority. It speaks of propriety being ornate yet inwardly decayed, adorned with falsehood and excessive detail—any movement departs from the Dao, and thus it cannot be responded to. ○*Exegesis:* Propriety emphasizes ceremonial decorum, as seen in the scriptures’ teachings on fasting, rituals, and etiquette. Moreover, the highest Dao is boundless and tranquil, its great form without substance; yet now it is devalued, the simple esteemed over the elaborate, the plain over the ornate, and only ceremonial authority is upheld. Though it may be a gradual teaching, it fails to align with true principle, not only contradicting the Dao internally but also unable to harmonize with the external world, hence it is said none respond to it. ○*Lu’s Saying:* The rites of jade and silk are used as tokens for betrothal, hence it is called "highest." Rank and title are conferred in due measure, hence it is said "acts." Yet with so many ceremonial details, the jade and silk are exhausted, and the people cannot sustain the sovereign, hence it is said "none respond to it." Because none respond, punishments are enforced. Then, he raises his arm in anger and drags others into conflict.
*Commentary:* It speaks of how, when propriety is too burdensome to be followed, the sovereign and the people grow resentful, hence he raises his arm in anger and drags others into contention. ○*Yu’s Saying:* Propriety emphasizes reciprocity and mutual expectation. Because of its shallow observance, he raises his arm in anger and drags others into conflict, desiring to make clear the flaws of teaching propriety. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: "Rujiu is thin, yet Handan was besieged"—this is its case. Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue alone remains.

「○*Commentary:* Virtue here refers to the **highest virtue** (上德). When the **Dao/Way** declines and the people grow weary, its transformative power fades, and only then does **virtue/power** manifest. It responds to things according to their time, but **virtue/power** of the lower order appears only when the **Dao/Way** is lost.

When **virtue/power** is lost, **benevolence** (仁) emerges,
　　○*Commentary:* It means that as **virtue/power** wanes, **benevolence** and love take its place.

When **benevolence** is lost, **righteousness** (義) arises,
　　○*Commentary:* When **benevolence**’s compassion fails to prevail, **righteousness**’s distinctions then arise.

When **righteousness** is lost, **propriety** (礼) is practiced.

　　○*Yu’s Saying:* Those who lose the **Dao/Way** lose the **highest virtue**, for the **highest virtue** aligns with the **Dao/Way**, hence it is said "lose the **Dao/Way**."

Now, **virtue/power**, **benevolence**, **righteousness**, and **propriety** are merely the names of refined and coarse customs in different times. Thus, when the **Dao/Way** declines, **virtue/power** appears; when **virtue/power** is lost, **benevolence** remains; when **benevolence** fades, **righteousness** stands forth; when **righteousness** is gone, **propriety** is resorted to—these are all fitting measures for their times. Therefore, when discussing **propriety** in the age of simplicity and purity (淳朴), it is either madness or perversity; when **propriety** is forgotten in the age of artificiality and corruption (浇醨), it is either foolishness or slander. If one can dissolve and transcend these layers, they should abandon **propriety** to uphold **righteousness**, abandon **righteousness** to uphold **benevolence**, abandon **benevolence** to uphold **virtue/power**, and forget **virtue/power** to return to the **Dao/Way**, thus restoring simplicity and purity. Then, the **highest virtue** will have nothing to rely upon.

　　○*Commentary:* From the **Dao/Way**’s decline in the age of artificiality and corruption to its uttermost extreme, unable to curb evil, **propriety** is then employed for ritual and etiquette. Though it may forcefully establish ceremonial decorum, its superficiality only grows worse.

**Propriety** is the thinning of **loyalty and trustworthiness** (忠信),
　　○*Commentary:* It means that **propriety**, though it regulates external forms, neglects its roots—**loyalty and trustworthiness**—and thus these virtues grow ever more shallow.

And the beginning of **chaos**.

　　○*Commentary:* **Propriety** values outward display over inner sincerity, so the upright and honest dwindle while licentiousness and disorder flourish.

　　○*Yu’s Saying:* **Propriety** is meant to rescue **chaos**, yet it esteems rigid knowledge. Those who cling to **propriety**’s outward forms—who prize jade and silk, who revere bowing and kneeling—are the very ones who become the starting point of **foolishness and ignorance**.

　　○*Commentary:* Those who claim to know without true understanding are called **pretense of knowledge** (前识). This is the case of those who have lost the **Dao/Way**’s substance but cling to its superficial trappings. Such **pretense of knowledge** is the origin of **stupidity and darkness**.

　　○*Gu’s Saying:* **Pretense of knowledge** refers to those who do not await deep inquiry. Now, the pure and subtle **Dao/Way** is profound beyond comprehension, formless and colorless—its truth lies within itself. Yet those who rely on elaborate discourse and ornate displays, who flaunt ceremonial splendor and arrayed beauty, these are not the **Dao/Way**’s true essence but its superficial adornments, the beginning of **stupidity**.

When **stupidity** first takes root, it has not yet encountered the **Dao/Way**’s true reality, so it is led astray by **pretense of knowledge**. The **Dao/Way**’s superficiality corrupts its very beginning. The *Sequence of Families* says: This interpretation is the most refined.

Therefore, the **great man** (大丈夫) dwells in the **thick substance** (厚),
　　○*Commentary:* **Great man** refers to one of **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**—a leader who sustains the people with courage, compassion, and wisdom. His aspirations are vast and universal, hence the name **great man**.

But not in the **thin veneer** (薄).

　　○*Yu’s Saying:* **Artifice** (有为) is the **Dao/Way**’s thinness. **Propriety** and **righteousness** are the **virtue/power**’s superficial adornments. Thus, the sage dwells in the **Dao/Way**’s **non-artifice** (无为), which is its **thick substance**.

　　○*Commentary:* The **great man** of the **Dao/Way**, the transcendent scholar, should anchor his emotions in **virtue/power**’s true essence, not fixate on the **pretense of knowledge**’s superficial trappings. Hence, he discards the latter for the former.

　　○*Commentary:* Discarding the **thin veneer** means severing **benevolence** and **righteousness**. Taking the **thick substance** means returning to simplicity and purity. Moreover, the **highest virtue** of the sage embodies **non-duality** (无分别), so how could he ever fixate on distinctions or be entangled in discarding and taking? Indeed, it is not a matter of discarding what is not to be discarded, nor of taking what is not to be taken. The same holds true for the **Dao/Way**’s duality of superficiality and substance.

In ancient times, those who attained **Oneness** (一):
　　○*Yu’s Saying:* **Oneness** is the **wonderful harmony of pure and subtle qi** (冲和之妙气).

　　○*Commentary:* **Ancient** refers to the past. It speaks of those who attained the **Dao/Way** in bygone ages, and their condition is fully described in the following text. This is **Yu** citing the past to elucidate the present.

The heavens attained **Oneness** with **clarity** (清),
　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that the **muddy pellet** (泥丸) within the human head emits **pure qi**, which descends to illuminate, hence it is said "with **clarity**."

　　○*Commentary:* The heavens absorb the **Dao/Way**’s **qi**, thus gathering **yang** to form the sky, which remains **clear and elevated** above.

The earth attained **Oneness** with **tranquility** (宁),
　　○*Commentary:* The earth, too, absorbs the **Dao/Way**’s **Oneness**, thus congealing **yin** to form the earth, which remains **tranquil and still** below.

　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that the **elixir field** (丹田) does not indulge in licentiousness or disorder, and **spirit** (神) resides within the body, hence it is said "with **tranquility**."

The **spirit** (神) attained **Oneness** with **aliveness** (灵),
　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* **Spirit** refers to the **heart** (心). The **heart** is the **alive spirit** of the five **zang** organs (五藏), hence it is said "with **aliveness**."

　　○*Commentary:* It means that the **spirit** attains **Oneness**, hence its ability to **transform and manifest without form**.»

The **Dao/Way** dwells in **yin**, dark and unfathomable,
　　○*Commentary:* By its **Oneness**, it achieves boundless **aliveness** and **wisdom**, hence *Zhuangzi* says: *"The spirits and the **Dao/Way**’s **Imperial Sovereign** (神帝) generate the heavens and the earth."*

The **valleys** (谷) attained **Oneness** with **fullness** (盈),
　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* The **valleys**—that is, the **Huaxi Palace** (华池宫)—can summon the **elixir spring** (醴泉), hence it is said "with **fullness**."

　　○*Commentary:* The **valleys** (谷) are mountain basins. By attaining **Oneness**, they can nourish flowing springs and fill the **Han moats** (汉壑) with abundance.

The **ten thousand things** (万物) attained **Oneness** with **birth** (生),
　　○*Commentary:* All sentient and insentient beings, collectively called the **ten thousand things**, share **Oneness** with the **Dao/Way**, hence they come to **birth** and **manifestation**.

　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that all things, though of varied forms, equally attain **Oneness** with the **Dao/Way** to bring forth life, hence it is said "with **birth**."

The **feudal lords and kings** (侯王) attained **Oneness** to govern the **world** (天下) with **rectitude** (正).
　　○*Commentary:* Feudal lords and kings alike observe the **Dao/Way** to transform, and by embracing **non-action** (无为) to attain **Oneness**, they can administer the world’s **affairs** (政). The examples are **Fangxun** (放勋) and **Wenming** (文命).

　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It refers to the **spleen** (脾). Positioned in the **central yellow** (中黄), it governs the four directions through **Oneness**, hence it is said "with **rectitude**."

The **Dao/Way’s** **manifestation** (致) is thus,
　　○*Yu’s Interpretation:* When things attain the **Dao/Way**, they are named accordingly. The **Dao/Way** persists, names stand; the **Dao/Way** fades, reality perishes. Hence, the heavens’ **clarity**, the earth’s **tranquility**, the **spirit’s** **aliveness**, and the **valleys’** **fullness** all arise from **wondrous application** (妙用) of the **Dao/Way**, thus it is said "its **manifestation**."

　　○*Commentary:* **Manifestation** (致) means **attainment**. It unifies the preceding six affairs, all of which attain **Oneness** with the **Dao/Way**. The *Inner Resolution* says: "This is the **sixfold practice** (六种行门) of a single individual."

　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that the heavens, earth, humans, **spirit**, **elixir waters**, **springs**, and the **ten thousand things** all attain **Oneness** to manifest, hence it is said "its **manifestation**."

The heavens, without **clarity**, would fear **rupture** (裂),
　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* If the **marrow pellet** (泥丸) does not attain **Oneness**, then the **brain** (脑) will wither, the **head’s white** (桔头白) will fade, and the **teeth** (齿) will fall out, hence it is said "rupture."

The earth, without **tranquility**, would fear **outburst** (发),
　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* If the **elixir field** (丹田) does not attain **Oneness**, then the **essence-qi** (精气) will dissipate, hence it is said "fear **outburst**."

　　○*Commentary:* **Outburst** (发) means **change and movement**. If the earth cannot apply the **Dao/Way** to remain **tranquil**, then disasters like **collapse** (崩沦) may arise. In ancient times, the **Qishan mountain** (岐山) collapsed, causing the **three rivers** (三川) to tremble—this is the case.

The **spirit**, without **aliveness**, would fear **extinction** (歇),
　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* If the **heart** (心) is disordered and does not uphold **Oneness**, then the body will **hollow out** (空) and age prematurely, hence it is said "fear **extinction**."

　　○*Commentary:* **Extinction** (歇) means **decay**. If the **spirit** does not rely on the **Dao/Way**, then **wisdom and application** (智用) will grow **stupid and sluggish** (愚怠), lacking **aliveness**, and will fear **extinction** and **obliteration**.

The **valleys**, without **fullness**, would fear **exhaustion** (竭),
　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* If the **Huaxi Palace** (华池宫) loses its **Oneness**, then it will lack **vital fluids** (津液), hence it is said "exhaustion."

　　○*Commentary:* **Exhaustion** (竭) means **blockage**. If the **valleys** (川谷) deviate from **Oneness**, then calamities will begin, causing the **springs** to dry up and the **flowing channels** (流注) to stagnate.

The **ten thousand things**, without **birth**, would fear **annihilation** (灭),
　　○*Commentary:* All the **ten thousand things** attain **birth** through **Oneness** with the **Dao/Way**; if they lose the **Dao/Way** and deviate from **truth**, then they will perish in an instant.

The **feudal lords and kings**, without **nobility and elevation** (贵高), would fear **overthrow** (蹶),
　　○*Yu’s Interpretation:* Those who attain **Oneness** must not boast of their **application**. The **Sages** (圣人) taught that their purpose is for the **living beings** (生灵), though they may elevate the heavens and earth to **clarity** and **tranquility**, their ultimate convergence lies in the **feudal lords and kings** practicing **humility** (谦和) and adhering to the **Dao/Way of female stillness** (雌静), thus avoiding **overthrow** or **annihilation**.

　　○*Commentary:* **Overthrow** (蹶) means **ruin**. If rulers cannot apply the **Dao/Way** to maintain their **nobility**, acting against **principle** (理) and **virtue** (德), then their **divine instruments** (神器) will fall into **disorder**, and their **states** (社稷) will face **peril**. The tyrants **Jie of Xia** (夏桀) and **Zhou of Shang** (殷纣) are such examples.

Thus, **nobility** must take **humility** as its foundation,
　　○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that those who seek **long life** (长生) must regard **original qi** (元气) as their **mother**, hence it is said "its foundation."

　　○*Commentary:* **Nobility** (贵) refers to **elevation** and **exaltation**. **Humility** (贱) means **lowliness**.

The ruler who attains **Oneness** (得一之君) thus remains humble,
while the ruler who loses the **Dao/Way** (失道之主) falls into arrogance and pride.
Hence, arrogance and pride are the foundation of lowliness,
and humility is the root of exaltation.
By measuring gain and loss,
one establishes this admonition.

**Exaltation** must take **humility** as its foundation.
○*Annotation:* It means that if one seeks true nobility,
they must take **humility** as their foundation—
just as when building walls or structures,
one must first establish a low base;
if the foundation is not firm,
the structure will inevitably collapse.

○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It means that those who cultivate **Dao/Way** to nourish **essence** (精) and supplement the **marrow** (脑) must use the **elixir field** (丹田) as their foundation—
thus, it is the foundation.

○*Gu’s Commentary:* Those who speak of **exaltation** taking **humility** as its foundation
do not attain nobility by themselves—
they are elevated by what the lowly revere.
They do not rise by themselves—
they are borne aloft by what is beneath them.
Thus, nobility depends on humility—
how could one not take **humility** as the root?

Therefore, the wise cultivate the foundation,
and thus remain humble without peril.
The foolish pursue superficiality,
and thus reach for heights only to fall.

Hence, rulers call themselves **"lonely and bereft"** (孤寡).
○*Annotation:* **"Lonely"** (孤) signifies solitude,
**"bereft"** (寡) signifies inability—
like a wheel hub (毂) that cannot be the center
for all spokes to gather.
Though kings and lords are most exalted,
they call themselves thus—
is this not taking **humility** as their foundation,
to enlighten the people?

○*Commentary:* **"Bereft"** (不毂) means unworthy.
Rulers, wise and enlightened,
know that arrogance is the root of self-destruction,
while humility is the foundation of true nobility.
Thus, they govern the common people,
shepherding themselves with humility.

○*Gu’s Commentary:* **"Bereft"** (不毂) means unworthy.
It means that **virtue** (德) is not something to be worshipped—
one cannot command the words of the multitude.
All three of these—
the ruler’s self-designation, the people’s revulsion,
and the ruler’s own humility—
are ways of taking **humility** as the foundation.
Is this not so?
○*Annotation:* **"Is this not so?"** (非乎) is merely an exclamatory rhetorical question.

○*Jie’s Interpretation:* It is not that their **Dao/Way** is **Original Oneness** (元一).
Thus, they achieve **"ten thousand chariots without a chariot"** (致数车无车).
○*Annotation:* **"Achieve"** (致) means to gather—
people gather around the chariot’s components:
spokes, wheels, hub, yoke, axle, and shaft,
yet none of these is called a chariot;
only when assembled do they become one.
Thus, rulers do not name themselves by their exalted titles,
and so their nobility is complete.

○*Commentary:* The box, cover, hub, and rim—
artificial combinations—
though called a chariot, lack true substance.
The five elements and four great forces are likewise illusory;
since the body is inherently empty,
where then would nobility reside?
Thus, when in a position of nobility,
one must practice humility.

○*Cai’s Commentary:* **"Praise"** (誉) refers to both praise and blame.
It means that a **Dao/Way**-governed ruler,
humble in self-cultivation,
forgets distinctions of nobility and lowliness,
and thus transcends both praise and blame.
Though people frequently extol his virtues,
he does not consider himself noble;
though they frequently condemn his failings,
he does not consider himself lowly.

○*Gu’s Commentary:* It means that the **noble person** (君子) establishes **moral cultivation** (道德功行) in mind and body.
Without virtue to display,
without traces to reveal,
their roots run deep and their foundations are firm—
unshaken by praise or blame,
desire or aversion.

**"Do not be polished like jade, nor rigid like stone."**
○*Yu’s Annotation:* **"Jing-jing"** (琭琭) describes jade’s appearance,
**"luo-luo"** (落落) describes stone’s appearance.
This is taking **humility** as the foundation.

**"The inverted is the movement of the Dao."**
○*Annotation:* This clarifies **strategic adaptation** (权).
**"The inverted"** refers to reversing conventional principles to align with meaning.

**"The weak is the application of the Dao."**
○*Annotation:* This clarifies **substance** (实).

The weak is taken for its yielding softness and receptive stillness—
receptive stillness is how the Sage abides in substance.
To abide in substance is the Dao’s constant application,
thus it is said: *The weak is the Dao’s use.*

All things under Heaven are born of *having*,
*—for all things arise from Heaven and Earth’s form and place.*
Having is born of *non-being*,
*—for Heaven and Earth’s mysteries, the fluttering and crawling of life,*
*all arise from the Dao, which is formless and nameless.*
This speaks of the root prevailing over the flourishing,
the weak prevailing over the strong,
humility prevailing over fullness.

○*Yu’s Commentary:*
Substance and strategy are like non-being generating having—
thus those who practice strategy must return to substance,
and those who employ having must rely on non-being.
Yet the ultimate Dao is boundless and silent,
free from names and forms.
All dharmas are of empty nature,
not dependent on each other.
If one can forget both strategy and substance,
and merge having and non-being,
then neither counting nor not-counting exists—
this may be called transcendence.

○*Exegesis:*
*Having* is the Dao’s manifestation—
the so-called *One Qi of non-being*.
The primal One is the wondrous root—
the so-called *silent and empty realm*.
All things under Heaven arise from the Dao’s manifested laws,
and these laws themselves arise from the wondrous root—
the ultimate non-being.

The superior person hears the Dao and strives to practice it.
*—The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, exerts utmost effort to practice it.*

○*Exegesis:*
The superior in wisdom, hearing the Dao,
instantly comprehends that all phenomena are empty,
thus they diligently cultivate without hesitation or laziness.

The middle person hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly.
*—The middle person, hearing the Dao,*
*seeks longevity through self-cultivation,*
*and seeks peace for the realm,*
*yet when confronted with wealth, desire, or honor,*
*they are confused by passions and abandon it.*

○*Yu’s Commentary:*
The middle person may ascend or descend,
thus they are doubtful—
sometimes holding, sometimes losing.

○*Exegesis:*
The middle in wisdom, dim in insight,
cannot fully grasp the principles.
Though they hear the Dao, they fail to penetrate its depths.
If they restrain their emotions and return to stillness,
they may briefly attain emptiness of mind,
but once immersed in worldly affairs,
they become entangled in the realm of having,
vacillating between gain and loss—
thus it is said: *uncertain holding or losing.*

The inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it.
*—The inferior person, greedy and desiring,*
*sees the Dao’s softness as terrifying,*
*sees its simplicity as vulgar,*
*thus they laugh loudly.*

○*Exegesis:*
The inferior in wisdom, dull and obtuse,
hearing the profound and vast truths of the Dao,
fail to comprehend and deem them empty fables,
thus they scoff and laugh aloud.

If it is not laughed at, it is not the Dao.
*—That which is not laughed at by the inferior is not worthy to be called the Dao.*

○*Exegesis:*
That which is not scorned by the vulgar
is not worthy to be called the Sage’s Way.

Thus, the establishment of speech is as follows:
*—The method of establishing the Dao is as in the six lines below.*

○*Exegesis:*
*Establishment*—to set forth.
The Dao practiced by the superior is established in the following:

The enlightened one appears as if in darkness,
*—The one who illuminates the Dao*
*appears as if blind and ignorant,*
*concealing their brilliance among the common.*

The one advancing in the Dao appears as if retreating,
*—The great scholar*
*does not reveal their progress,*
*though internally cultivating,*
*externally they seem to decline.*

The one in harmony with the Dao blends with the common,
*—*Harmony*—levelness.
The great Daoist does not distinguish themselves,
appearing as if among many.*

The Sage’s virtue is like a deep valley,
*—The Sage of highest virtue*
*is like a valley,*
*unashamed by filth or dampness.*

○*Exegesis:*
The one who excels in moral cultivation
is equal to the boundless void,
thus they can embrace all things,
like an empty valley.
*[Original note:]* Those who forget virtue
do not differ from the vulgar.

The greatly pure appear as if shamed,
*—The greatly pure and virtuous*
*appear as if stained,*
*not displaying themselves.*

○*Exegesis:*
*Purity*—cleanness.
*Shame*—defilement.
The one of great purity and high conduct
blends with the dust,
does not dazzle others,
thus they can mix unnoticed—
like defilement.

Hence, the Eastern Sage purifies their Way
while staining their traces—
this is the very meaning.

The broadly virtuous appear insufficient,
*—The one of vast virtue*
*appears as if foolish and lacking.*

○*Yu’s Commentary:*
Great achievement while holding humility.

○*Exegesis:*
The one bearing great virtue,
abiding in Daoic forgetfulness,
internally overflows,
yet externally appears deficient.

Laozi’s transmission states:
*The skilled merchant hides deeply like emptiness,*
*The Sage of great virtue appears as if foolish.*

The one establishing virtue appears as if deceitful,
*—The one establishing morality*
*appears as if stealing,*
*hiding their name and progress,*
*like one who acts secretly,*
*thus the Classic says:*
*‘As if fearing their neighbors.’*

The genuine appear as if false,
*—The genuine and sincere*
*appear as if their colors fade,*
*unclear.*

○*Yu’s Commentary:*
Pure and harmonious in light.

○*Exegesis:*
*Genuine*—substance.
*False*—change.
The scholar of pure substance,
still yet moving,
true yet responsive,
their changes reveal impermanence—
thus they appear as if false.

The great square has no corners,
*—The great and square*
*has no crookedness or angles.*

○*Exegesis:*
*Corner*—angle.
The one embodying the great square
follows things naturally,
does not cling to principles,
does not establish petty angles—
as said: *‘The superior transcends all nodes.’*

Great vessels take long to mature,
*—The great vessel*
*is like the Nine Cauldrons and coral ornaments,*
*not formed hastily.*

○ *Exegesis:*
The Nine Cauldrons and coral ornaments
are not formed in a single day—
a parable for the scholar of the Great Learning,
who cannot swiftly attain enlightenment.
They must accumulate eons of cultivation and vigilance
before attaining the utmost emptiness—
thus the tale of *Ren’s Son* fishing in astonishment.

○ *Sectional Analysis:*
It speaks of steadfastly abiding in the One without peril,
and thus, in aging, attaining the Dao.

*The Great Sound is rare in voice,*
*—The Great Sound, like thunder,*
*awaits its moment to move—*
*a metaphor for cherishing qi and sparing speech.*

○ *Exegesis:*
*Rare*—as if nonexistent.
The utmost Dao, in its profound silence,
descends from its wondrous origin without a trace of sound.
The Master Blind could hear yet not perceive its voice.
The resonant *Qiong* vibrates through the cosmos,
to illuminate the manifestation as the origin—
thus it is said: *The Great Sound is rare in voice.*

*The Great Image is formless,*
*—The one embodying the Great Law’s symbol*
*is unadorned and without outward appearance.*

○ *Exegesis:*
The Dao’s symbol is formless yet manifest.
*Li Lou* gazes yet sees no shape—
its hues pervade the void,
to reveal the paradox of presence within absence—
hence, *The Great Image is formless.*

*The Way is hidden, nameless.*
*—The Dao’s depths elude all designation.*

○ *Exegesis:*
The utmost Dao, in its mysterious obscurity,
defies measurement by form or instrument—
how could mere names or speech ever explicate it?

Only the Dao
is benevolent in lending and fulfilling.
*—To fulfill*—to complete.

○ *Exegesis:*
*Lending*—borrowing.
This nameless Dao alone possesses boundless compassion,
thus stooping to rescue all beings.
It borrows their virtuous strength,
shielding all classes from poison,
nurturing the Three Realms,
through myriad expedients,
guiding them toward fulfillment.

*The Dao generates the One,*
*The One generates the Two,*
*The Two generates the Three,*
*The Three generates the Ten Thousand Things.*

*—The Dao generates the One*—the Dao’s first generation is the One.
*—The One generates the Two*—the One generates yin and yang.
*—The Two generates the Three*—yin and yang generate the three qi of harmony, purity, and turbidity, partitioning into Heaven, Earth, and Man.
*—The Three generates the Ten Thousand Things*—Heaven, Earth, and Man together generate the Ten Thousand Things, as Heaven bestows, Earth transforms, and Man nourishes them.

○ *Honor’s Commentary:*
*The Dao generates the One*—within the void, qi stirs, hence *the Dao generates*.
Before primordial qi divides, it is called the One.
*The One generates the Two*—pure and turbid separate, yin and yang manifest.
*The Two generates the Three*—the two qi circulate through the Three Realms.
*The Three generates the Ten Thousand Things*—the round Heaven covers above, the square Earth bears below, and Man governs between—what thing fails to emerge?

*The Ten Thousand Things bear yin while embracing yang,*
*—The Ten Thousand Things without fail bear yin while turning toward yang,*
*returning to the heart and seeking the sun.*

○ *Chen’s Commentary:*
Yin and yang are the Dao’s wondrous functions—
*bear* means external, *embrace* means internal.

#1 *The clashing qi harmonizes.*

「Annotations:
*The Ten Thousand Things all contain primordial qi*—
by which they are harmonized and softened.
If in the chest there is a *藏* (hidden essence),
and in the bones there is *髓* (marrow),
then within grasses and trees there is *空虚* (emptiness/voidness),
and the harmonizing qi subtly pervades—
thus they attain longevity.

○ *Honor’s Commentary:*
Yang qi is hot and solitary—
it too cannot generate the Ten Thousand Things.
Yin qi is cold and lone—
it too is insufficient to form shape.
Through the *Great Dao* it is communicated,
and by the *clashing qi* it is harmonized—
thus the Ten Thousand Things come to be.

What men detest,
are the *孤寡不谷* (lonely, widowed, and unblessed),
yet kings and lords take them as their titles.
Annotations:
*The lonely, widowed, and unblessed*—
this is the name for *谷不祥* (unauspicious blessings),
yet kings and lords take them as their titles—
dwelling in humility,
and following the *voidness*, *emptiness*, and *softness*.

○ *Sparse Commentary:*
Loneliness and widowhood are matters of misfortune—
to abhor them is human nature.
Yet kings and nobles employ them to govern themselves,
proving that nobility stems from humility,
and exalted status rests on lowly foundations,
urging those who seek the Dao
to cultivate a humble and yielding heart.
Thus, some things are diminished when increased—
Annotations:
*If one pulls, it cannot be pushed*—
*Wenzi* says: *"To vie is to lack, to yield is to have excess.
To yield is to give rise to propriety and righteousness;
to vie is to spawn violence and chaos."*
—
and increased when diminished.

Annotations:
*Those who heap highness court collapse,
and those who covet wealth invite ruin.*

○ *Master’s Commentary:*
He who diminishes himself is benefited by others.
He who benefits himself is diminished by others.
Thus, those who *朝宗* (return to the root) excel in yielding,
and the humble and weak hold the reins of *德* (virtue).
For *孤寡* (lonely/widowed) to be a title—
is it not fitting?

○ *Master’s Sparse Commentary:*
*Thus*—reiterating the previous point.
*Diminished*—meaning self-abasement.
Speaking of kings and lords who adopt the titles of *孤寡* (lonely/widowed)
to humble themselves,
the people will joyfully promote them,
revering and serving them,
and the governance thus flourishes.
Or, when increased yet diminished—
if kings and nobles indulge their own bodies,
dwell above and grow arrogant,
then those below scatter and the realm collapses.
*The Book of Documents* says:
*"Fullness invites loss, humility invites gain"—
this is what is meant.

○ *Cheng’s Commentary:*
Humility and softness,
diminishing oneself to aid others—
things will naturally gravitate toward him,
thus attaining the Dao and preserving wholeness.
Arrogance and boasting,
increasing oneself to dominate others—
things will resist him,
thus inviting peril and ruin.
Peril and ruin are *损* (loss),
wholeness and life are *益* (gain)—
the verification of loss and gain
is entirely manifest,
thus it is said:
*to diminish is to gain*,
*to increase is to lose*.

What men are taught—
Annotations:
*That the common people are taught to forsake weakness for strength,
and softness for rigidity.*
—
I too instruct them with righteousness.
Annotations:
*Saying that I teach the common people
to forsake strength for weakness,
and rigidity for softness.*

○ *Master’s Commentary:*
The *Laozi* says:
*"When a ruler desires to establish teachings to teach the people,
he must use my doctrine of softness, weakness, humility, and emptiness to instruct them."*

○ *Sparse Commentary:*
The vulgar and those of the *儒* (Confucian) teachings also extol humility and softness,
yet my school’s gate
originally reveres stillness and retreat,
values emptiness and forgetfulness—
thus it differs.

The *强梁* (unyielding/rigid) do not die naturally—
Annotations:
*The unyielding*—those who do not trust in *玄妙* (mystic profundity),
rebel against *道德* (Daoist virtue),
do not follow the *经教* (scriptures and teachings),
and rely on power and force.
*Do not die naturally*—meaning they are cut off by fate,
slain by arms,
executed by royal law,
and do not attain death by natural lifespan.
I shall make them my *教父* (teaching progenitor).
Annotations:
*Progenitor*—the origin.

○ *Master’s Commentary:*
I have seen the unyielding perish,
and the soft and weak preserved—
thus I make this teaching of softness and weakness
the progenitor of all teachings.

○ *Sparse Commentary:*
*Unyielding*—akin to *刚躁* (rigidity and impetuosity).
*Progenitor*—the origin.
Speaking of those who are rigid and unyielding—
they must surely die young,
and cannot rely on fate to die naturally.
Though the *Laozi* expounds the law in myriad ways,
and his teachings are not singular,
he always says that softness and weakness are good,
and rigidity and strength are evil—
this is the most critical point
for those who seek the Dao to grasp first.
*Progenitor*—origin.

○ *Gu’s Commentary:*
Speaking of these rigid and unyielding men—
since they do not die naturally,
I establish this teaching for them,
explaining the *无为* (effortless Daoist virtue),
and making it the foundational progenitor of their instruction.

*The utmost softness in the world,*
*drives through the utmost firmness in the world.*
Annotations:
*The utmost softness*—water.
*The utmost firmness*—metal and stone.
Water can penetrate rigidity,
and enter strength—
it flows through all without obstruction.

○ *Sparse Commentary:*
*Utmost softness*—water.
*Utmost firmness*—metal.
*Drives through*—to penetrate.
Speaking of water’s utmost softness
yet ability to break through metal’s firmness—
it illustrates that the *无为* (effortless Dao)
in its utmost softness
can shatter the burdens of *有为* (worldly striving).
Thus the following passage says:
*"The world’s soft and weak,
none surpass water—
in attacking rigidity and strength,
none can rival it."*

*Without form, it enters the formless.*
Annotations:
*Without form*—the Dao.
The Dao has no substance or quality,
thus it can emerge and enter without obstruction,
communing with the divine,
and benefiting all living things.

○ *Master’s Commentary:*
*Without form*—untainted by mundane realms,
and the heart holds nothing.
*Without obstruction*—the Dao’s nature is naturally pure and clear,
its subtle body unified and complete,
with no gaps or separations.
If one is not disrupted by desires,
and both heart and realm are still,
holding nothing at all,
then the heart aligns with the Dao,
and emerges and enters without obstruction.

○ *Sparse Commentary:*
*Obstruction*—gaps.
Speaking of those who are deluded—
they see emptiness as having form,
while those who perceive truthfully
see form as emptiness—
thus *without form*.
*Enter*—harmonious resonance.
*有为* (worldly striving) is coarse and sparse,
thus it has gaps.
*无为* (effortless Dao) is subtle and refined,
thus it has no obstruction.
Yet in both form and emptiness,
it can enter the formless principle.

○ *Che’s Commentary:*
Speaking of water and wind—
they originally have no substance or form,
metal and stone, marrow—
they too have no gaps or obstructions.
Wind and water can already
penetrate and traverse,
and their attacks are relentless.
The most wondrous Dao
is inherently formless—
karmic entanglements and coarse habits
also lack gaps or openings.
The Dao’s profound grace
has long since entered and permeated—
to trace the roots of their bonds,
to reveal the foundation of their stubbornness,
to administer the medicine of awakening,
to open the mechanism of their true nature—
this is *without form entering the formless*.」

The Master thus knew that *effortless Dao* is beneficial.

**Commentary:**
I have seen the Dao of *effortless action*, yet all things spontaneously transform and complete themselves—thus I know that *effortless Dao* is beneficial to humanity.

The teaching of *unspeaking*,
**Commentary:**
The Dao’s method is unspeaking; the Sage guides by example.

The benefit of *effortless action*,
**Commentary:**
The Dao’s method is *effortless*—to cultivate the self benefits the spirit, to govern the realm benefits the people, and it avoids toil and labor.

○ Sun said:
Softness can overcome hardness; *nothingness* can dispel *somethingness*—thus it is known that the teaching of *effortless Dao* greatly benefits humanity.
Few in the world attain it.
**Commentary:**
The world’s ruler—few can approach the Dao’s *effortless* cultivation of self and governance.

○ Cushion:
What is called *unspeaking* is not about sealing the mouth.
In principle, it is both *having* and *not having*; in teaching, it is both *speaking* and *silence*.
Both *speaking* and *silence*—thus it is called the teaching of *unspeaking*.
Both *having* and *not having*—thus it is called the benefit of *effortless action*.
The benefit, though not a benefit, is indeed a benefit; the teaching, though not a teaching, is indeed a teaching.
This is the exhaustive exploration of principle and nature—rare discourse in the world.
Worldly teachings seldom reach this, hence it is said that few in the world attain it.

○ Gu said:
The Heavenly follows in silent mystery, yet customs shift naturally—thus it is called the teaching of *unspeaking*.
The Dao’s method is *effortless*; things and people transform spontaneously—thus it is called the benefit of *effortless action*.
Which is closer—*name* or *self*?
**Commentary:**
When *name* succeeds, the *self* retreats.

○ Yu said:
*Name* is the guest of *reality*; the world pursues *name* and loses the *self*—thus the question arises: which is closer?
It is to abandon merit and *name* and preserve the true.

○ Cushion:
*Self*—the inner, the real.
*Name*—the outer, the guest.
*Na* (who)—who.
The world seeks the outer and loses the inner, covets *name* and loses *reality*.
Why? Praise and fame are originally for the *self*—if the *self* is for *name*, when the *self* dies, what use is the *name*?
The Old Master pitied this inversion, thus he reversed: *Name* and *self*—which is truly yours?
Do you covet *name* and forget the *self*?
By this measure, closeness and distance become clear—thus *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Biyí died for his name beneath Chief Yang’s hill."*

Which is more—*self* or *wealth*?
**Commentary:**
Wealth multiplies and harms the *self*.

○ Yu said:
Pursuing abundance to seek wealth—wealth obtained, the *self* lost—thus the question arises: which is more?
It is to cast away jade and shatter pearls to preserve the *self*.

○ Cushion:
Wealth is originally for the *self*—deluded ones lose the *self* for wealth.
Thus the Old Master reproaches: *You abandon the self for wealth—wealth is more beneficial, or losing the self is more beneficial?*
Thus *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Zhoulu died for profit atop Mount Shunling."*

Which is the affliction—*gain* or *loss*?
**Commentary:**
Excessive desire for gain brings ruin in conduct.

○ Cushion:
To covet wealth excessively is to lose oneself; to desire little is to preserve the *self*.
Then *gain* is the sign of self-ruin, *loss* the proof of self-preservation.
Self-ruin is affliction; self-preservation is joy—yet the world reverses this, calling *gain* suitable and *loss* affliction.
How mistaken!
Thus the teaching says: *Gain and loss—determine which is the affliction.*

Excessive love brings great expenditure.
**Commentary:**
Excessive love of beauty wastes the spirit; excessive love of wealth invites calamity.
The more one loves, the less one retains—thus it is called great expenditure.

○ Cushion:
*Expenditure*—loss.
This is its meaning: those who love fame excessively labor their bodies and weary their minds, depleting their spirit and intelligence.
This sentence resolves *name*.

Hoarding much brings great loss.
**Commentary:**
The living hoard in treasuries; the dead are buried in graves.
The living face robbery and plunder; the dead face grave-robbing and coffin desecration.

○ Cushion:
Those who hoard wealth in treasuries must fear robbers—
not only losing their wealth but also endangering their lives.
Their ruin is deep and their calamity great.
Thus the *Book of Documents* says:
*"An ordinary man without guilt, yet his jade brings him guilt."*
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"The great scholar Luo recited:
Green wheat grows on the hillocks—
If not given in life, why hoard pearls in death?"*
Thus he struck his chin with a hammer and parted his cheeks—
lest the pearl in his mouth be harmed.
This sentence resolves *wealth*.

Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace.
**Commentary:**
Those who know sufficiency cut off desires and avoid gain—
their bodies unshamed, their spirits at ease.

○ Cushion:
Understanding wealth’s falsity, guarding one’s portion, content and serene—
thus there is no shame.
This sentence resolves *wealth*.

Knowing when to stop brings no peril.
**Commentary:**
Knowing when to stop and stopping—
wealth and gain do not burden the body and mind,
sounds and colors do not confuse the ears and eyes—
thus one’s life is never in danger.

○ Cushion:
Having awakened to *name*’s falsity, one ceases attachment,
preserving the *self* and avoiding harm—
thus there is no peril.
The previous passage says:
*"Name has already been attained—
then one will know when to stop."*
This sentence concludes *name*.

Thus it can endure long.
**Commentary:**
If one knows when to stop, blessings and fortune abide with them.
Cultivating the self, the spirit is unwearied;
governing the realm, the people are undisturbed—
thus it can endure long.

○ Cushion:
Knowing when to stop with *name*, knowing sufficiency with *wealth*,
forgetting *name* and gain—
thus it can endure long.
This sentence summarizes *name*.

Xiangu was a *Chengyi Lang* of the late Northern Song.

*The Dao De Jing* Commentary and Exegesis, Volume Five
By Wu County Recluse Gu Xuan

Great completion seems incomplete,

**Annotations:**
「注：」—*Commentary:*
「○御曰：」—*Master Gu’s Explanation:*
「○疏：」—*Exegesis:*

---

Great completion, though seemingly incomplete,
*—Commentary:* This refers to the sovereign of supreme *Dao* and *virtue*—
though appearing incomplete, like a shattered vessel,
he extinguishes his *name* and conceals his merit.
Thus his use is unexhausted.
*—Commentary:* His mind, thus governed, knows no depletion with time.
*—Master Gu’s Explanation:* Humility brings benefit, so there is no time of want or ruin.
*—Exegesis:* The one whose deeds are fully accomplished
yet forgets his accomplishment—
though fully accomplished, he seems deficient.
Only because he forgets his accomplishment
does his wealth and use never diminish through time.

Thus does *Zhuangzi* say:
*"Small completion obscures the *Dao*."*

Now, completion is not incomplete,
incompleteness is not completion—
yet today, completion seems incomplete,
forgetting incompleteness, forgetting completion.
Thus, unseen is completion as incomplete,
so it seems incomplete yet is truly complete;
unseen is incompleteness as completion,
so great completion seems incomplete.

Great fullness is like emptiness,
*—Commentary:* This refers to the sovereign of supreme *Dao* and *virtue*—
though full, like emptiness, he does not dare to be proud in his nobility,
nor extravagant in his riches.
Thus his use is inexhaustible.
*—Commentary:* His mind, thus governed, knows no exhaustion with time.
*—Exegesis:* *Chong* is emptiness; *jing* is exhaustion.
The one whose *Dao* and *virtue* are fully satisfied
yet satisfies his fullness—
thus, though full, he seems empty and void.
Only because he forgets fullness, emptiness, and voidness
does his utility never fail.

Now, fullness is not emptiness,
emptiness is not fullness—
yet today, fullness seems empty,
forgetting fullness, forgetting emptiness.
Thus, he is both empty and full,
full yet seeming empty.

Great rectitude is like bending,
*—Commentary:* Great rectitude refers to the upright practice of *Dao* and law,
yet bending, like one who does not contend with the vulgar,
as if yielding and pliable.
*—Exegesis:* The one of great simplicity and sincerity
does not display his rectitude openly,
thus blending with the common, bending with things—
hence, he seems bent.
Thus, true rectitude surpasses petty rectitude.

Great skill is like clumsiness,
*—Commentary:* Great skill refers to abundant talents and achievements,
yet seeming clumsy, he does not dare to display his abilities.
*—Exegesis:* The artisan who crafts myriad things,
the smith who forges all life—
though possessing great skill and achievement,
he forgets his craft and utility,
hiding his traces among the common—
thus, he seems clumsy.
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"He carves and shapes all forms yet does not consider it skillful."*
Thus, true skill surpasses petty skill.

Great eloquence is like inarticulateness.
*—Commentary:* Great eloquence is unquestionable wisdom;
yet seeming inarticulate, he has no verbal adornment.
*—Master Gu’s Explanation:* He does not embellish with trivial tales.
*—Exegesis:* The one whose profound insight dissects true emptiness,
measuring the utmost mysteries—
his speech is beyond speech.
He does not conform to the world’s ways.
Swift and sharp in talent, thus his speech is halting and inarticulate.
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"The unsaid eloquence"*—also, *"Great eloquence does not speak."*
Thus, true eloquence surpasses petty eloquence.

Frenzy overcomes cold,
*—Commentary:* *Sheng* means extreme.

The vitality of spring and summer ascends swiftly and fiercely above—when all things reach their utmost flourishing, cold ensues, and cold brings withering and death. Thus, it is said that one should not align with rigid excess.

*Qi* of stillness overcomes heat.
*—Commentary:* In autumn and winter, all things rest beneath the Yellow Springs—when stillness reaches its extreme, heat arises, and heat is the source of life. ○*Exegesis:* *Liao* (frenzy) is the *yang* (active, bright). Stillness is the *yin* (passive, dark). *Sheng* (overcomes) means extreme. It speaks of the four seasons’ cyclical turn: when *yin* reaches its peak, *yang* emerges; when *yang* reaches its peak, *yin* arises. *Yin*’s emergence causes all things to wither; *yang*’s emergence causes all things to flourish. It analogizes stillness as the foundation of longevity, while frenzy is the root of decay, urging practitioners to abandon frenzy and return to stillness. Again, it explains: descending from the origin to its manifestation, we see frenzy overcoming cold. Returning from the manifestation to the origin, we see stillness overcoming heat. This clarifies how movement and stillness adapt to their proper times.

*—Master Gu’s Explanation:* All things pushed to their limit invert. Movement pushed to its limit becomes stillness; stillness pushed to its limit becomes movement. Observing this, we see that extreme flourishing leads to decline, and extreme decline leads to flourishing—all phenomena in the world follow this pattern. Since it is not the norm to preserve, what should one covet or seek? Therefore, the sage takes nothing, seeks nothing, gains nothing, loses nothing, and in the five great practices of *Dao*, remains naturally pure and still, unaffected by cold or heat. Only then can he be the true master of the world, as it is said: *"He who clears and stills himself becomes the rightful master of the world."*

*—Commentary:* To clear and still oneself is to become the rightful master of the world. *Clearing* and *stillness* ensure enduring rectitude, and holding to the *Dao* means there is no end to its timelessness.

*—Exegesis:* Pure, tranquil, and at ease—one can benefit himself and others, rectify what is wrong and suppress what is perverse. Thus, he becomes the rightful master of the world. This then concludes the exposition of stillness overcoming frenzy, clarifying the distinction between excellence and mediocrity.

*—Master Jie’s Explanation:* It refers to entering deep mountains, practicing purity, and abiding in nature—then one becomes a true person. When the *Dao* prevails in the world, *—Commentary:* Meaning when the ruler of the world follows the *Dao*—

However, the warhorses are turned to plowing fields.
*—Commentary:* "Plowing" (粪) here means tilling. It signifies that when arms are not used, warhorses are instead employed to cultivate the fields. For those cultivating the self, it means channeling the vital essence of *yang* to nourish the body.

*—Master Yu’s Explanation:* A ruler who follows the *Dao* governs through *wu-wei*, his actions free from greed, thus avoiding warfare. He dispenses with the use of warhorses, allowing people to till the fields. For those cultivating the self, it means restraining the six senses—like an army—to till the heart with the *Dao*. Hence, Mencius said: *"All till their fields with dung, but none till their hearts with learning."*

When the *Dao* prevails in the world,
*—Commentary:* Meaning when the ruler of the world follows the *Dao*—

the warhorses are stabled at the outskirts.
*—Commentary:* Constant warfare keeps warhorses stationed at the borders, never returning. *—Exegesis:* The outskirts are called *jiao* (郊). A ruler without the *Dao* oppresses his people, causing chaos. Greedy for territory, he wages endless wars, forcing military horses to remain permanently beyond the borders. Moreover, those who are reckless and competitive, their hearts devoid of the *Dao*, let their six senses—like an army—gallop through the dusty realm, hence the saying that they "generate at the outskirts."

No guilt is greater than indulging desire.
*—Commentary:* Lustful desire. *—Exegesis:* "Guilt" (罪) means ruin—being overwhelmed by suffering. When one encounters alluring sights that stir the heart’s craving, it is called "desirable." Yet, if external phenomena can ensnare the mind, they become the root of sin. Thus, the previous passage states: *"Do not see what is desirable, lest the heart be disturbed."*

No calamity is greater than knowing insufficiency.
*—Commentary:* Wealth and honor cannot restrain oneself. *—Exegesis:* "Calamity" is the deepest form of guilt—when the heart clings to external phenomena, never satisfied, harming others and depleting resources. The guilt grows ever deeper, not just afflicting oneself but extending to three generations.

No blame is graver than the craving to possess.
*—Master Yu’s Explanation:* The greatest misfortune is desire; its consequences are deep, hence "blame." *—Exegesis:* "Blame" (咎) means censure. The heart’s craving for possession knows no bounds—its censure is unparalleled. Comparing the depths of guilt and calamity, the latter is heavier, while blame is lighter. To fully reveal human nature, both are made explicit.

Thus, the sufficiency of *knowing sufficiency*,
*—Commentary:* Preserving the true root—
is ever sufficient.
*—Commentary:* Free from desire. *—Exegesis:* One who adheres to their proper place, without indulging in external pursuits, is always complete, never lacking.

Without stepping outside,
one knows the world.
*—Commentary:* The sage does not step outside yet knows the world because they understand others through themselves, and others’ families through their own. *—Exegesis:* "Outside" refers to perception, discrimination, and the gates of the senses. The virtuous person, with an empty mind and inner stillness, does not let their thoughts wander into external phenomena, yet knows all under heaven. This is true illumination reflecting the mundane.

Without peering through the window,
one perceives the *Dao* of Heaven.
*—Commentary:* The *Dao* of Heaven and humanity are the same; Heaven and man are interconnected, their vital *qi* flowing together. When a ruler is pure and still, Heaven’s *qi* aligns naturally. When a ruler is greedy, Heaven’s *qi* becomes turbulent and impure. All fortune, misfortune, benefit, and harm arise from within oneself. *—Master Yu’s Explanation:* With hands resting and *wu-wei* governance, no decrees are issued beyond the door, yet the *Dao* of Heaven is known. *—Exegesis:* The window (牖) refers to the sensory orifices. The *Dao* of Heaven is the natural principle. In a state of forgetfulness, seated and still, one does not gaze through the sensory gates, yet the true heart shines brightly, revealing the natural *Dao*. This is wisdom illuminating truth.

The door allows passage in and out—
from true illumination to the mundane.
The window, when closed within—
a return to the true source.

The farther one goes,
the less one knows.
*—Commentary:* Observing others’ families from afar, others’ bodies from a distance—what is observed grows farther, and what is known grows less. *—Exegesis:* Those who are inverted cannot perceive truth; their minds follow phenomena, ever distant yet never satisfied. Their knowledge is shallow and obscured, lacking discernment.

Thus, the sage acts without going,
yet knows all.
*—Commentary:* The sage does not ascend to Heaven nor descend into the abyss, yet knows the world through the mind. *—Exegesis:* "Acts without going" means the mind does not cling to external phenomena yet knows all things in their true nature. Like a mirror hung in a hall, objects pass before it and are reflected without effort. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: *"The sage does not use the mind to illuminate Heaven."*

Without seeing,
one names.
*—Commentary:* The ruler cherishes the *Dao*, the people cherish virtue; the ruler values martial prowess, the people value strength. The sage infers the great from the small, the external from the internal. *—Exegesis:* "Without seeing" means penetrating the emptiness of all phenomena, for there is nothing visible. "Names" refers to rectifying names and classifying all things, leaving traces and manifesting teachings. Without seeing, one diminishes emotional attachments and ornamental excesses daily. *—Master Yu’s Explanation:* Since one does not peer through the window, it is said, "without seeing." When humanity and Heaven are in harmony, one can name the era of great peace.

Without doing,
one achieves.
*—Commentary:* If the ruler does nothing, the people have no tasks; households are prosperous, and all things transform naturally. *—Exegesis:* "Without doing" means concentrating the spirit in stillness, abandoning all action. "Achieves" refers to nurturing all beings and perfecting those who learn—this illustrates stillness in motion.

For those who study,
daily increase.
*—Commentary:* "Those who study" refers to governance, teaching, rites, and music. "Daily increase" means emotional desires and ornamental excesses grow ever more.

「○ *Exegesis:* "For" means cultivating and embellishing. "Learn" refers to mundane studies. It speaks of those who cultivate mundane learning—with sharp emotions and discriminating minds, their desires thus accumulate daily. "For Dao daily diminishes" means they act in accordance with the Way of Nature, causing their desires and embellishments to be daily eroded away.

○ *Master Yu’s Explanation:* Those who study accumulate knowledge daily, while those who follow the Dao diminish their deeds. "Accumulating knowledge" is the gradual progression of mundane study, while "diminishing deeds" is the gateway to enlightenment. Thus, through accumulation, one cultivates virtue, and in forgetting virtue, one attains the Dao itself.

○ *Exegesis:* "For Dao" means cultivating the Dao. It speaks of those who cultivate the Dao—with empty minds and tranquil ease, their wisdom and virtue gradually become clear, and their delusions daily dissipate. "Diminish again, diminish again" means diminishing desires once more, and again, so as to gradually eliminate them, until reaching the state of *wuwei* (non-action).

○ *Exegesis:* Those who study cling to desires, while those who follow the Dao are hindered by the notion of *wuwei*. Though their depths differ, both suffer afflictions. Now, to correct these two extremes, there is the text on diminishing and augmenting. First, diminish and diminish desires; later, diminish and diminish the fixation on *wuwei*. With both extremes dispelled, one attains the non-action of the central path. In non-action, there is nothing that is not done.

○ *Exegesis:* This is the Dao of stillness in motion, of embodying yet applying—thus, there is nothing that is not done. The earlier section states: "The Dao is ever *wuwei* yet ever *wuwei*." To govern the realm, one must always do so without exertion—never burdening the people with laborious tasks.

○ *Exegesis:* "Govern" means to transform and guide. It speaks of those who transform and guide all under Heaven, leading them to goodness, always through *wuwei* and non-exertion. Though they respond to things and act accordingly, their minds remain undisturbed—this is stillness within motion. Hence, *Zhuangzi* says: "Who is it that wears himself out, making things his business?" When one truly has affairs, he is unfit to govern the realm.

○ *Exegesis:* When his mind is not yet empty and forgetful, treating affairs as his business and thus having affairs, this is different from true *wuwei*. True *wuwei* is distinct from having affairs; motion differs from stillness, and stillness contradicts motion. Such a person is unfit to transform and guide the realm.

○ *Exegesis:* The Sage has no mind—never altering his ways, valuing steadfastness, as if without mind. He takes the hearts of the people as his own—following what they find convenient.

○ *Exegesis:* In embodying the Dao, he penetrates and forgets all things, his mind empty and free from thought, like still ashes. Thus, he has no mind. The people are all beings. Though the Sage has no mind, he responds to all stimuli—his responses follow the sensations of things. Hence, he takes the hearts of the people as his own, yet in having no mind, his responses are also without responses.

○ *Master Yu’s Explanation:* "The Sage’s heart is without heart, yet it responds to all stimuli." Thus, those who are already trustworthy, he trusts them; those who are not, he also trusts them. When the people’s virtue is good, the Sage’s virtue is also good. When the people are trustworthy, the Sage trusts them; when they are not, he also trusts them. When the people’s virtue is good, the Sage’s virtue is also good.

○ *Master Yu’s Explanation:* Those who desire goodness and trustworthiness, I follow them accordingly. Those who are not trustworthy, I also teach them goodness and trustworthiness, so that the people are moved by my virtue to become good and trustworthy.

○ *Exegesis:* Trustworthiness means taking delight in hearing the *dharma* and precepts, while lack of trust means not rejoicing in the Dao’s teachings. The Sage, through empty practice and compassion, universally transforms and guides all beings equally, regardless of trust or doubt, so that all may benefit and universally awaken faith. Hence, the *Zhenji* of *Zhenwei* says: "Trust is the key to gain or loss." The *sutra* also states: "Trust is the pivot of learning the Dao."

One question: If the Sage has no mind, yet responds to all stimuli, and does not respond when there are none, then does he teach those who are trustworthy but not those who are not? Yet the text says that both trustworthy and untrustworthy are taught in the same way, and so too with stimuli and non-stimuli—all are responded to alike.

The answer: There is both universal and particular response. Like treating illness in the *Xuan Du* Palace of Jade Clarity, yet always saving the Three Realms—this is universal response. As for the barbarians who, upon sensing the *Zhi* of Purple Qi, receive the *Dao* from *Yin* the True Person—this is particular response.

If the response is particular, it awaits particular stimuli; if universal, it is ever-present with boundless compassion. Hence the *sutra* says: *"Ever saving all beings without abandoning any."*

**Explication:**
It means that when a person is trustworthy, trust is one; when trust is one, it trusts the person. If a person does not trust the One, the One arises from the person, so the Dao ever attains its trust.

The Sage moves through the world with constant reverence—
*Note:* The Sage, moving through the world, is ever reverent and fearful, never daring to indulge in arrogance or excess from wealth and honor.

**Commentary:** *Reverence* (*chùchù*)—the form of ceaseless fear—speaks of having no mind to respond to stimuli.

The Sage, dwelling in the world, ever spreads great compassion, protecting and saving all beings, fearing they may perish or drown. Thus, he moves with constant reverence and fear.

He muddles the hearts of the people—
*Note:* The Sage muddles the hearts of the common folk, as if making them dull and unknowing.

**Commentary:** *Muddled* (*húntūn*)—without distinction. It speaks of how ordinary people, ensnared by emotions and entangled in the world, foolishly grasp at gain and loss. The Sage desires to muddle their hearts, leaving them without distinction, and this is the meaning of his constant fear and reverence.

All the people focus their ears and eyes—
*Note:* *Focus* (*zhù*)—to use.

All the people use their ears and eyes as the Sage’s eyes and ears.

**Commentary:** The *River Above* text reads *zhù* (focus), while other versions read *yín* (indulgence). *Indulgence* means to be stained and entangled; those who are deluded and inverted, lost in the world, give free rein to their ears and eyes, clinging to sounds and colors. Later, they drift adrift in endless wandering, accumulating faults day by day. The Sage pities their suffering, so he reveals their affliction.

Among the six senses, two are highlighted to show these two afflictions are the deepest.
Thus the *Sutra of Western Ascension* says: *"Ears and eyes, sounds and colors—these are the children’s faults."* Yet by mentioning one sense, all senses are implied, for completeness’ sake.

The Sage treats them all like infants—
*Note:* The Sage loves and cares for the people as if they were newborn children, nurturing them without expecting repayment.

**Commentary:** Ordinary beings indulge their ears and eyes, drowning in the river of desire. The Sage, with constant fear and compassion, acts like one who pities infants, grieving their ignorance.

They are born and they die.
*Note:* *Born*—when emotions arise from within, the spirit is settled, the soul is still, hence *born*. *Die*—when emotions enter the chest, the spirit is confused and agitated, hence *death*.

**Commentary:** *Born*—transcending the Three Realms, free from birth and death.
*Die*—sinking into the Three Paths, drowning in birth and death. If one understands the meaning of birth and death, it is from non-being to being, releasing *birth* as *birth*; from being back to non-being, releasing *extinction* as *death*.

There are thirteen kinds of those who are born, and thirteen kinds of those who die.
*Note:* It speaks of the thirteen types of birth and death—namely, the nine orifices and four passages.

In their birth: the eyes do not gaze wantonly, the ears do not listen wantonly, the nose does not sniff wantonly, the mouth does not speak wantonly, the tongue does not taste wantonly, the hands do not grasp wantonly, the feet do not walk wantonly, the vital essence is not expended wantonly. In their death, it is the opposite.

**Commentary:** *Kinds* (*tú*)—types. The nine orifices and four passages belong to both sages and ordinary beings. The Sage forgets them, thus transcending the Three Realms. Ordinary beings cling to them, thus entering the Six Paths. Entering the Six Paths is the kind of death; transcending the Three Realms is the kind of birth.

A person’s life moves toward thirteen kinds of death.
*Note:* When a person seeks life through action, it reverses into thirteen kinds of death.

**Commentary:** When a person’s life is directed toward death, it is because they cling to these thirteen (senses), becoming entangled in the world before them.

Why is this so?
*Note:* Asking why one moves toward death through action.

**Commentary:** A rhetorical question, answered below.

Because their attachment to life is excessive.
*Note:* The reason one moves toward death through action is that their pursuit of life is too heavy, contrary to the Dao and Heaven, acting recklessly and losing measure.

**Commentary:** It speaks of how people cannot embody the Dao and forget life, instead clinging to life as real, accumulating wealth and resources, overindulging in life’s concerns, thus moving toward death. This sentence answers the prior question.

Indeed, it is heard that those who skillfully nurture life—
*Note:* *Nurture* (*shè*)—to guard, to nourish.

**Commentary:** *Indeed*—not a direct answer, akin to *"I have heard."* *Nurture*—to guard, to nourish. It speaks of how those who skillfully guard and nourish life are simple and unadorned, untouched by the world. The excellence of their guardianship is shown below.

When walking on land, they avoid rhinoceroses and tigers—
*Note:* Naturally avoiding harm, which does not reach them.

**Commentary:** *Land*—flat ground. *Rhinoceros*—a poisonous beast with one horn, resembling a wild ox, green in color. It speaks of how those who nurture life skillfully are not harmed by poisonous beasts. Internally, it means they remain calm and undisturbed by afflictions in daily life.

Entering battle, they are unharmed by armor and weapons—
*Note:* They do not love war or killing.

**Commentary:** It speaks of how those who nurture life do not enter battlefields and are not harmed by weapons. Internally, even if they enter the world, they are not injured by desires.

Rhinoceroses have no place to strike with their horns, tigers no place to place their claws, weapons no place to lodge their blades—
*Note:* Those who nurture life skillfully are not injured by rhinoceroses or tigers, nor harmed by weapons.

**Commentary:** Other texts say *zhù* (stationary). *Stationary*—to stand; *place*—to settle. Rhinoceroses, encountering objects, charge; this allegorizes the foolish. Tigers are fierce and violent; this allegorizes greed. Weapons are sharp and can harm people; this allegorizes gluttony. It speaks of how those who nurture life skillfully embody true emptiness, so even amid the world, they are unharmed by the Three Poisons.

Why is this so?

*—Asking why tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons do not harm them.*

For they dwell in the realm of no-death.

*—Because they do not violate the thirteen forbidden grounds of death, the numinous protects them, and these creatures dare not harm them.*

*—The Way flows naturally without partiality; they do not regard death as death, so things cannot harm their life—thus, the realm of no-death.*

*—Those who perceive form as form regard the body as the ground of death. But those who practice life-nurturing skillfully forget bodily form—when form is forgotten, there is no ground for death. Without the ground of death, how could the Three Poisons take hold?*

*—The Sage embraces spirit and unity, regulates qi and stabilizes the fetal breath, thus these creatures cannot harm them. The Dao dwells in the heart, and true qi abides—there is no ground for execution.*

The Dao gives birth to them,
Virtue nurtures them,
Form shapes them,
Momentum completes them.

*—The Dao generates all things. Virtue (unity) spreads qi and nurtures them.*

*—The Supreme Dao is boundless and mysterious, generating all things; supreme virtue is compassionate and sustains all life—thus, "the Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures."*

*—It endows them with form and momentum to complete them.*

*—Thus all things reverence the Dao and honor virtue.*

*—All things arise from the Dao and virtue; hence, they are revered.*

*—The Dao and virtue are honored not by titles but by their natural operation.*

*—The Dao’s honor and virtue’s nobility require no artificial elevation—they are naturally so.*

Thus the Dao:
Gives birth to them,
Nurtures them,
Lengthens them,
Cultivates them,
Perfects them,
Matures them,
Sustains them,
Covers them.

*—The Dao’s work for all things is not merely to give birth but to lengthen, nurture, perfect, mature, sustain, and cover—fulfilling their nature and life.*

*—This mirrors the ruler’s governance of state and self.*

*—The text repeats earlier phrases to introduce what follows. The Dao is mentioned without virtue because virtue does not differ from the Dao, though the text is concise for brevity.*

As the *Western Ascension Scripture* says:
*"The Dao and virtue are indistinct and mysteriously unified."*

Lengthening refers to fostering their virtuous sprouts.
Cultivating refers to advancing their deeds.
Perfecting and maturing refers to refining their hearts with supreme teachings, so their Dao is fulfilled and their virtue perfected—this echoes prior language to lead into the next passage.
Sustaining and covering: sustaining refers to rewarding their fruits; covering refers to sheltering with boundless compassion.

The four pairs above clarify the virtue of benefiting all things; the three below clarify the Dao’s self-effacing function.

Giving birth yet not possessing,
Acting yet not relying,
Lengthening yet not controlling—
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.

*—The Dao’s operation is an unfathomable benevolence, invisible yet profound.*

*—This refers to the passage above, introducing what follows. "Mysterious" denotes depth; "virtue" signifies protective fulfillment. It points to those who embody the Dao, benefiting others while forgetting their own deeds, guiding people with the law—truly Mysterious Virtue.*

*—The Dao is the apex of yang, yang being heaven. Heaven moves, thus generating all things. Virtue is the apex of yin, yin being earth; earth encompasses, thus nurturing all things. Receiving qi is birth; nurturing form is sustenance—the forms and momentum of all things. Perfecting refers to completing them through their deeds and momentum, forming human shape.*

*—The Dao endows all beings with the four seasonal rhythms, completing all things—this explanation precedes.*

At the origin of all things lies the Dao,
Which becomes the mother of all under heaven.

*—The origin is the subtle black of primordial harmony; this mysterious qi generates all things with nourishing virtue, thus it can be the mother of all under heaven.*

*—The Dao is the primordial mother; this is its description. The mysterious Dao is the source of great wisdom, transcending names and forms, beyond all colored appearances. All things under heaven arise from it.*

---

Now the text speaks of those who boldly proclaim,
Seeking to make the Wayfarer* recognize the root and know the origin,
Thus the Classic says: *"All things originate from the Dao."*

When it says *"the mother of all under heaven,"*
It means the Dao descends from its origin,
Guiding and nurturing the teeming multitude,
Cultivating and fostering them,
Like a mother’s love for her child,
Hence the Upper Classic says: *"The Dao that bears a name is the mother of all things."*

*—Cai says: "Origin" is the root.*
All beings are sunk in the Five Desires,*
Ignorant of their root and origin,
Driven by the current, chasing after trivial ends,
Floating through life and death.
Thus the Venerable Lord Laozi raises the root to show them,
Illuminating that the world possesses the Clear and Void Qi as Virtue and Power,
As your root and origin.
Moreover, the origin has no predecessor,
The mother has merit,
Taking the Dao’s role in generating life,
Thus it is called *"origin."*
The nurturing merit is then called *"mother."*

Having known its mother,
One must also know its child.
*—The child is Unity.*
Having known the Dao,
One must also know Unity.

*—Yu says: When all things have received the Clear Qi’s nurturing virtue,*
And know their own bodies,
That is the Clear Qi’s child.

*—Cui says: The root can generate form,*
The mother can generate life.
Having known that the Dao is my mother,
I know that I am the Dao’s child,
Born from the Dao.

The Classic says: *"The Void and Natural is the true parent."*
Having known its child,
One must again safeguard its mother,
*—Safeguarding Unity,*
One must again safeguard the Dao,
Returning to Non-Action.*

*—Cai says: Having known that I am the Dao’s child,*
And thus obtain life,
I must safeguard the Clear and Tranquil Non-Action,
Returning to its mother,
Thus merging with the Dao.
The body will not perish.
*—It will not be endangered.*

*—Yu says: Having known that the body is the Clear Qi’s child,*
One must safeguard this Clear and Harmonious Qi,
Preventing its dispersion,
Then the body will not perish,
And its danger will not manifest.

*—Cui says: Having known that I am the Dao’s child,*
I must return and safeguard its mother.
But if one can return to the root and safeguard the mother,
Safeguarding the Dao to attain Truth,
Though the forms may appear or vanish,
The origin remains undangerous and unendangered.
Why so?
The Dao can generate life,
The Dao is the origin.
Life arises from the Dao,
Life is the trivial end.
Yet the trivial end can encompass the origin,
Thus one must return to its mother.
The mother can generate the child,
Thus one must safeguard its mother.
Safeguarding the mother brings enduring vision and longevity,
Returning to the root ensures the body’s safety,
Hence the exhortation.

The *Xisheng Classic* says: *"Constantly nurturing the mother, one can endure long."*

Close the *Fu* (eyes),
*—Preventing the eyes from viewing indiscriminately.*
Shut the *Men* (mouth),
*—Preventing the mouth from speaking indiscriminately.*
*—Cui says: Though the text above exhorts safeguarding the mother,*
It has not yet shown the method of cultivation and safeguarding,
Thus the following passage fully displays the means of safeguarding and returning,
Including closing and shutting.*

*Fu* is the mouth,
*—Yet among the Six Roots,*
The *Fu* is singled out,
Revealing that the Yang River* is both the Three Activities and the Six Roots,
And its sins are manifold.
*Men* refers to the Five Gates.
Closing the Five Gates,
*—Preventing contamination by dustly realms.*
The previous mention of *Fu* was a distinction among the roots,
Now *Men* is the comprehensive root.

But the meaning of closing and shutting has two aspects:
One is to sever desires and endure colors,
To take refuge in mountains and forests,
Or to turn away and shut the gates,
*—Not seeing what is desirable.*
Two is to understand that the Six Dusts are illusory and insubstantial,
The roots are not true,
Within, there is no heart capable of contamination,
Without, there are no desirable realms.
Thus, though one’s eyes see and ears hear to their utmost,
One remains ever in the Dao’s realm,
Not straying from the True,
How could one say that plugging ears and closing eyes is closing and shutting?
No, it is not so—
This is the wondrous essence of closing and shutting.

All one’s life, one is not weary.
*—When humans close their eyes to prevent indiscriminate viewing,*
And shut their mouths to prevent indiscriminate speaking,
They will not toil all their lives.*

*—Cui says: "Weary" means labor and suffering.*
The Dao has many paths,
The gates are not singular;
Some still the heart to avoid dustly realms,
Some dwell in realms to grasp the True Source,
Deep and shallow entanglements,
Indeed manifold.

Thus the *Xisheng Classic* says: *"Action brings calamity, and the self is burdened—*
This is the utmost toil and suffering."
But if one follows the earlier closing and shutting,
Dwelling in realms while attaining the True,
The heart’s nature is at ease and broad,
Free from labor and fatigue,
Thus one can live out the years,
And not weary all their lives.

Open the *Fu* (eyes),
*—To indulge in the Five Desires’ gates,*
And aid the Six Dusts’ affairs,
*—The heart and spirit grow inwardly exhausted,*
The ears and eyes are outwardly strained,
All one’s life in labor and fatigue.*

All one’s life, one is not saved.
*—Calamity is accomplished.*

*—Cui says: When the foolish act thus,*
They open the eyes and ears,
Assisting in sound and color,
All their lives entangled,
Perishing in lust,
Even the Great Sage and Great Compassionate
Could not save them from this fate.*

Seeing small is called *Ming* (clear).
*—When sprouts are yet unseen and calamity not yet revealed,*
That is the small and manifest,
Only seeing is called *Ming* (clear).*

*—Yu says: When humans, at the onset of affairs,*
See the small and change their conduct,
This can be called *Ming* (clear).*

*—Cui says: "Seeing" is observation and illumination,*
"Small" is the name for the minute and subtle.
The utmost subtle principle,
Speaking that humans, if they but observe the subtle realm,
Will daily increase in wisdom and clarity,
Hence the Upper Classic says: *"Observe its subtlety."*
Safeguarding softness brings daily strength.
*—Cui says: Having seen the small,*
Wisdom and clarity increase,
And one can apply the Dao,
Knowing softness as well,
Thus one’s virtue and deeds grow daily stronger.
At the start of learning,
There is steadiness and benefit,
There is practice and understanding,
Seeing the small is the gate to benefit and steadiness,
Applying softness is the extension of practice and understanding.
Thus among the Six Perfections,
There is practice and understanding,
The first five are practice,
The last is understanding,
Understanding is benefit and emptiness,
Practice encompasses both emptiness and substance,
Using substance to guide emptiness,
Using emptiness to aid substance,
Desiring to clarify the ability of guidance and aid,
Thus it is said: "Apply softness, see the small."*

「Use its light—
*—Cui says: To deploy its luminous gaze outward,*
And observe the world’s advantages and harms.
Then return to its clarity—
*—Cui says: To withdraw its light inward,*
Lest the spirit be dissipated outward.
○ *Commentary:* Light illuminates the external.
Yet once deployed, it is forgotten—
Concealing brilliance, obscuring traces,
Returning clarity to the dim.
Thus it is said: *Then return to its clarity.*
The following passage states: *Illuminating without dazzling.*
*Zhuangzi* says: *The brilliance of doubt is what the Sage seeks to avoid.*
Without inviting calamity upon oneself—
*—Cui says: To inwardly preserve the spirit,*
Lest it be lost or harmed.
This is called *habitual cultivation.*
*—Yu says:* "遗" (*herni*—*to invite*) means *to share with* or *to give to*.
To restore and guard the inner clarity,
Then no calamity is shared with the body—
Thus it is called *secretly applying the Dao of True Constancy.*
○ *Commentary:* Once deployed and forgotten,
The round virtue is fully practiced,
All burdens exhausted,
No lingering calamity remains.
It is also said: *No calamity is shared with the body,*
And all burdens are fully exhausted.
When deeds are complete,
All burdens are exhausted—
The transmission of the scripture and the master’s teaching
Belongs to this person,
Thus one may call him *inheriting the Dao of Constancy,*
And *continuing the True Teaching.*

*—If I were to possess even a modicum of knowledge,*
I would walk the Great Dao—
*—Cui says:* "介" (*jie*—*modicum*) means *great*.
Laozi laments that rulers do not walk the Great Dao,
Thus he sets forth: *If I were to possess even a modicum of knowledge,*
I would then walk the Great Dao,
Personally embodying the transformation of *Wuwei*.
○ *Jie Jie’s Annotation:* I have always, day and night,
Guarded the One within my body.
○ *Wang Bi and Luoshimo* say#1: "介" (*jie*—*modicum*) means *small*—
If I had even a small measure of knowledge,
I would then walk the Great Dao.

*—Yet I alone fear what is applied.*
*—Cui says:* "唯" (*wei*—*alone*) means *only*.
Only fearing what is applied,
Lest the Dao’s intent be lost—
Desiring to reward the good, yet fearing false goodness arises,
Desiring to trust the loyal, yet fearing deceitful loyalty emerges.
○ *Yu says:* The Master Laozi speaks:
If I were to be upright and boast of my knowledge,
Desiring to walk the Great Dao,
Yet it does not align with the Dao,
Thus only what is applied is to be feared.
○ *Commentary:* "使我" (*shǐ wǒ*—*If I*) is a hypothetical phrase.
Knowledge is discrimination.
"介然" (*jièrán*—*modicum*) is minute.
The Great Dao is most level and easy,
Yet if I were to arise with even a modicum of discrimination,
To knowingly walk the Dao,
This is deeply unfit.
Why?
The Ultimate Dao is empty and boundless,
Its mysteries surpass all discrimination—
Neither true nor false,
Neither real nor unreal,
True and false share the same nature,
Death and life are the same offering.
Entering the Nine Abysses without confusion,
Exiting the Three Realms without distinction,
Treading dangers yet ever secure,
Confronting great calamities without fear.
Now, to arise with discrimination,
To deviate from the Ultimate Dao—
All actions lead to the path of death,
Thus they are to be feared.

The Great Dao is most level and easy,
Yet people prefer crooked paths.
*—Cui says:* "径" (*jing*—*crooked paths*) means *devious ways*,
While the Dao is most level and easy,
Yet people prefer to follow devious paths.
○ *Commentary:* "夷" (*yi*—*level*) is upright and true.
"径" (*jing*—*devious*) is the crooked way.
The utmost principle is equal and level,
Without distinction or discrimination,
Yet those who are inverted
Turn from the true to the devious,
Thus the Great Dao is neglected,
And petty achievements flourish.

*—Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of people’s love of deceit and falsehood,
And their reckless pursuit of shortcuts.

*—Morning is most refined,*
*—Cui says:* High palaces and pavilions,
Elaborate halls and chambers.
○ *Commentary:* The ruler without Dao
Loves devious paths,
Does not uphold simplicity,
Only values luxury and excess—
Then he demolishes his old halls,
Raises new palaces,
Carves pillars and beams,
Exhausts all ornate beauty.

*—Fields are most overgrown,*
*—Cui says:* Agriculture neglected,
Unplowed and uncultivated,
Wasting the seasons.
○ *Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of people not refining their inner nature,
But instead adorning themselves morning and evening,
Thus generating illness—
Their hearts become wild and unclean.
○ *Commentary:* With taxes and labor burdens heavy,
Farmers abandon their work—
The eastern slopes lie fallow,
The southern fields overgrown with weeds.

*—Granaries are most empty,*
*—Cui says:* The five grains are harmed,
The state has no reserves.
○ *Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of not guarding the inner constancy,
Thus the five *zang* organs are depleted—
Hence it says *empty*.
○ *Commentary:* Harvests decline,
The state has no wealth—
The loom and spindle lie idle,
Granaries are left bare.

*—Wearing embroidered silks,*
*—Cui says:* Loving false adornment,
Valuing external splendor.
*—And carrying sharp blades,*
*—Cui says:* Upholding rigidity,
Martial and extravagant.
○ *Yu says:* Virtue is not cultivated,
Yet martial strength is prized.
○ *Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of loving fine garments,
Rejecting falsehood for truth—
Carrying sharp blades,
Relying on weapons for defense,
Thus falling ill from the influence of malevolent spirits.

*—Sated with drink and food.*
*—Cui says:* Excessive desires,
Never knowing contentment.
○ *Commentary:* Brocade and embroidery adorn the body,
Ganjiang and Moye guard the life,
Sweet wine and rich meats delight the palate—
Yet they do not exalt the superior virtue,
Nor care for the common people.
Alas, the gluttonous and greedy!
They reach this extreme.

*—Wealth and goods are in excess,*
This is called *plundering and boasting.*
*—Cui says:* The people lack sufficient means,
Yet the ruler has excess—
This is due to robbing and plundering
For his adornments and extravagance,
Holding displays to boast before others,
Unknowing that death and ruin will follow,
And his kin will perish with him.

*—Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It speaks of loving sweet and fatty foods
To nourish the body,
Yet abandoning the inner constancy—
Thus a hundred ailments arise,
And wealth is amassed only for the sake of death and mourning.

*—This is not the Dao!*»
*—Cui says:* If a ruler acts thus,
His death is not in accordance with the Dao.

「Again, it says *"Also, this is not the Dao!"*—
A lamenting and grieving expression.

*—Yu says:* To indulge in what is known,
Every action brings ruin—
Acting like thieves and robbers,
Yet still boasting and vaunting,
Boasting and thievery are not the Dao,
Only inviting sighs of lamentation.

*—Jie Jie’s Annotation:* It means that people do not practice *non-action* (無爲),
But only think of fine clothing and delicious food,
As if they could become thieves and robbers,
Yet they cannot stop sickness or avert death—
Thus, it is not the Dao.

*—Commentary:* Hoarding wealth and amassing riches,
Like thieves and bandits,
Both storing and accumulating,
Yet boasting and showing off,
Contrary to reason and against virtue—
This is called *"not the Dao."*

*—The one who walks the Dao with a resolute heart*
Cannot be praised—
His carriage is stripped bare,
No virtuous deeds remain.
His fields lie overgrown,
His mind neglected.
His granaries stand empty,
No moral cultivation.
He adorns himself with embroidered finery,
Delights in ornate speech.
He wears a sharp blade,
His greed as keen as steel.
He feasts on food,
Yet indulges in its flavors.
Wealth and goods abound,
Yet he does not disperse them.
Goodly foundations cannot be uprooted—
*—Annotation:* *Jian* (建) means to establish.
Those who establish themselves and their realm with the Dao
Cannot be pulled away or overturned.

*—Commentary:* *Jian* (建) means to establish.
*Ba* (拔) means to topple.
One who establishes the Dao-heart
Has firm resolve,
Reaching the Dao-field,
Unshakable and unyielding.

*—Wang and Lu say:* A carriage is made from many materials,
Only then is it called a carriage.
A ruler is formed by the people bearing him,
Only then is he called a ruler.
Yet without materials,
How can a carriage exist?
Without people,
How can a ruler stand tall?
Thus, one who loves carriages
Must value the materials,
And one who treasures the Dao-root
Must guard the people.

*—Jie Jie’s Annotation:* The Dao is truly nameless, embracing *Oneness* (抱一),
Guarding within, not seeking without—
Thus, it is said to have *"no praise"*.
*—The one who holds fast to the Dao*
Cannot be separated—
*—Annotation:* Those who hold fast to the Dao with their spirit,
Forever cannot be pulled away or freed.」

This verse follows upon the resolve of the Dao-heart,
And begins the practice of the Dao-body.
*—The one who holds fast to the Dao*
Gains the eternal *Oneness*—
Never deviating or failing.

*—Sacrifices of descendants do not cease.*
*—Annotation:* The *Master* says: *[The one who] holds fast to the Dao-root through virtue and power,*
Whose merit extends to posterity,
Loving the sweet osmanthus grove—
How much more so for their descendants?
*—The ruler’s merit lies in the Dao,*
The ancestor’s virtue lies in the Dao,
Thus, the rise of Zhou began with Hou Ji,
And was completed by Wen and Wu.
*—Zhou’s sacrifices*
Honor Hou Ji in the *Altar of Heaven* (郊祀),
And worship Wen Wang in the ancestral temple (宗祀),
So even when divination foretold thirty generations of succession,
And seven hundred years of rule,
When the main stream of the ancestral temple was destroyed and overflowed outward,
*—The sacrifices to Hou Ji and Wen Wang did not cease.*

*—Practicing the Dao in oneself,*
One’s virtue becomes true;
*—Annotation:* *[The one who] practices the Dao in oneself,*
Nurtures *qi* and tends the spirit,
Extending life and prolonging years—
*—Thus, their virtue is real.*
*—Annotation:* Through prior learning and practice,
One refines oneself until
*—The body and mind harmonize,*
*—And virtue and power are truly realized.*

*—Practicing the Dao in the family,*
One’s virtue becomes abundant;
*—Annotation:* *[The one who] practices the Dao in the family,*
*—Where the father is kind and the son filial,*
*—Where brothers are friendly and younger siblings obedient,*
*—Where the husband is trustworthy and the wife chaste,*
*—Thus, their virtue brings lasting blessings,*
*—Extending to future generations.*

*—Practicing the Dao in the village,*
One’s virtue becomes enduring;
*—Annotation:* *[The one who] practices the Dao in the village,*
*—Respects and honors elders,*
*—Loves and nurtures the young,*
*—Instructs the foolish and ignorant,*
*—Thus, their virtue covers all without exception.*

*—Practicing the Dao in the state,*
One’s virtue becomes rich;
*—Annotation:* *[The one who] practices the Dao in the state,*
*—Then the ruler is trustworthy and the ministers loyal,*
*—Ren and righteousness arise naturally,*
*—Rites and music flourish spontaneously,*
*—Governance is fair and without bias,*
*—Thus, their virtue is abundant and profound.*
*—Annotation:* The five ranks of feudal lords,
*—Purified and refined through the Dao,*
*—Bring peace within their domains,*
*—With no internal or external worries,*
*—Are they not the virtuous and sagely rulers,*
*—Whose deeds are rich and ample?*

*—Practicing the Dao in the world,*
One’s virtue becomes universal.
*—Annotation:* The sovereign who practices the Dao in the world,
*—Acts without words and transforms without teaching,*
*—The people respond to the ruler as shadows follow form,*
*—Trustful as echoes follow sound,*
*—Thus, their virtue is boundless and far-reaching.*
*—Annotation:* The *Nine-at-the-Top* sovereign (九五之君),
*—Rules by the Dao,*
*—Upright and silent, profound and taciturn,*
*—Bringing great peace to the world,*
*—Thus, all nations come to pay homage,*
*—And all quarters submit in allegiance,*
*—Their transformation reaches everywhere,*
*—Their virtue is universal.*

*—Thus, one observes oneself through oneself,*
*—Annotation:* With the Dao-refined body,
*—Observing the body unrefined by the Dao,*
*—Who perishes, who survives?*
*—One observes the family through the family,*
*—Annotation:* With the Dao-refined family,
*—Observing the family unrefined by the Dao.*
*—One observes the village through the village,*
*—Annotation:* With the Dao-refined village,
*—Observing the village unrefined by the Dao.*
*—One observes the state through the state,*
*—Annotation:* With the Dao-refined state,
*—Observing the state unrefined by the Dao.*
*—One observes the world through the world.*
*—Annotation:* With the Dao-refined sovereign,
*—Observing the sovereign unrefined by the Dao.*
*—How do I know the world is thus?*
*—By this.*

*—The Master* speaks: *How do I know of the world’s rise and fall?*
*—By measuring it against this standard,*
*—It suffices as a mirror and tortoise-shell guide.*
*—Annotation:* The *Master* says: *I know of the world’s rise and fall,*
*—Of those who practice the Dao flourishing,*
*—And those who abandon the Dao perishing,*
*—By observing this way.*

*—Annotation:* Yao and Shun’s ascension to peace was because of the Dao.
*—Jie and Zhou’s* descent into licentiousness was because of the lack of the Dao.
*—Thus, it is known:*
*—Observing the Dao-refined body against the unrefined,*
*—Observing the Dao-refined world against the unrefined,*
*—Even to the harm and benefit of families and states,*
*—The truth can be discerned.*

*—Thus, the Master* sets forth the analogy:
*—How do I know the world’s success and failure?*
*—Only by this criterion,*
*—It suffices as a mirror and tortoise-shell guide.*

*—The depth of one’s contained virtue*
*—Annotation:* *[The one who] contains and cherishes virtue and power deeply.*
*—Is likened to a newborn babe.*
*—Annotation:* The spirit’s protection and blessing for those who contain virtue,
*—Is like a parent’s care for a newborn babe,*
*—As illustrated below.*

*—Poisonous creatures do not sting,*
*—Annotation:* Bees, wasps, snakes, and viper-like creatures do not sting them.
*—Fierce beasts do not seize,*
*—Annotation:* Birds of prey do not snatch them,
*—And raptors do not strike.*
*—Annotation:* The babe does no harm to creatures,
*—And creatures do no harm to the babe,*
*—Thus, in a world of great peace,*
*—No matter noble or lowly,*
*—All have hearts of benevolence,*
*—Sharp objects return to their roots,*
*—Poisonous creatures do not harm humans.*

*—The Master* says: *The Perfect One is divine,*
*—Creatures cannot harm them,*
*—Having no intention to harm others,*
*—Thus, there is no place for venomous stings,*
*—This is the Perfect One’s contained virtue.*

*—Annotation:* Poisonous creatures are snakes and vipers.
*—Birds of prey are eagles and hawks.*
*—Fierce beasts are rhinos and tigers.*
*—Sting (螫) refers to venomous attacks.*
*—Strike (搏) refers to violent contact.*

The babe does not transgress the boundary of the present moment,
thus avoiding the three afflictions of external harm.
This illustrates the Perfect One’s profound virtue—
thus unharmed by the three poisons.

Though bones are frail and sinews supple,
their grasp is unyielding.
*—Annotation:* The babe’s sinews and bones are weak yet firm in holding,
for their intent is singular and unwavering.
*—Exegesis:* The babe’s sinews and bones are weak,
yet their grip is unshakable—
a metaphor for the Perfect One’s nature:
soft yet yielding, harmonious and humble,
though mingled with the dust of the world,
their inner purity remains unstained.
Thus, their grasp is firm—
this verse reveals the cooling of *intentional action*.

Unknowing of the union of male and female,
yet the vital essence surges—
the utmost refinement of *jing*.
*—Annotation:* The babe, unaware of sexual union,
yet their *yin* energy stirs—
a result of abundant *jing-qi*.
*—Exegesis:* The *Zìlín* says: *"Jia"* refers to the babe’s *yin*.
The babe, newly born, ignorant of copulation,
yet their *yin* swells in agitation—
a sign of *jing* overflowing the chambers.
How much more so for the Perfect One,
whose body embodies pure harmony,
effortless and empty,
though tossed in the waves of the world,
hearing sights and sounds—
yet awakened to true emptiness,
seeing no trace of union.
For their essence is most refined—
this verse reveals the cooling of *physical action*.

They wail all day yet their voice does not grow hoarse,
the utmost harmony.
*—Annotation:* From dawn till dusk,
the babe’s cry remains unchanging—
a result of abundant harmonizing *qi*.
*—Master’s Commentary:* The babe’s bones are frail, sinews supple,
yet their clenched fist is unyielding;
unknowing of *yin-yang* union,
yet their harmonizing *qi* stirs—
all from the utmost refinement of essence.
Their wailing never falters, voice unstrained—
a sign of perfect harmony.
This is the babe’s embrace of the *Dark*.
*—Exegesis:* Their cries arise without intent,
and harmony does not disperse.
How much more so for the Perfect One,
whose profound virtue penetrates the true essence—
thus able to speak without words,
though entangled in myriad things,
yet never contradicting the unsaid.
This verse reveals the cooling of *verbal action*.

To know harmony is to know the constant.
*—Annotation:* If one knows the gentle, yielding *qi* as beneficial,
then they grasp the Dao’s enduring truth.
*—Master’s Commentary:* To remain like the babe,
steadfast in softness and harmony—
this is the practice of knowing the constant.
*—Exegesis:* To recognize this speechless speech,
this pure and harmonious principle,
is to embody the eternal Dao.

To know the constant is to be enlightened.
*—Annotation:* If one practices the Dao’s enduring truth,
then daily they illuminate the profound mysteries.
*—Exegesis:* To know the eternal Dao
is to shine with wisdom’s radiance.

To nurture life is auspicious.
*—Annotation:* *Auspicious* means *growth*.
The babe’s life grows naturally, day by day.
*—Exegesis:* *Auspicious* means *abundance*.
Those deluded by worldly desires,
unaware of birth and non-birth,
indulge in worldly gains,
thickening their vital *qi*—
thus their afflictions and obstructions multiply daily.

The heart directs *qi*, making it strong.
*—Annotation:* If the heart remains focused on harmony and softness,
then *qi* solidifies within, and the form grows supple.
But if the heart is driven by delusion,
harmonizing *qi* departs,
and the body grows rigid and strong.
*—Master’s Commentary:* If the heart harbors distinctions,
*qi* loses its differentiation—
to force the heart to command *qi*
is to become a tyrant of strength.
*—Exegesis:* The heart is the spirit;
*qi* is the body.
Worldly passions invert truth,
and delusion arises from contact.
How could they know all things are empty,
the body but an illusion?
Yet they compel the spirit to dominate the form,
driving it in toil—
thus the karmic bonds of birth and death grow ever stronger.

When things reach their peak, they wither—
this is called *not the Dao*.
*—Annotation:* When all things peak, they decay and age,
and decay brings no attainment of the Dao.
*—Exegesis:* The flourishing must decline;
when things reach their height, they age—
thus, to nurture life and strengthen *qi*
proves the impermanence of existence.
Since impermanence is true,
this cannot be the true Dao.

Not attaining the Dao brings early decline.
*—Annotation:* Those who fail to attain the Dao decline early.
*Early decline* means *death*.
*—Master’s Commentary:* All things, when at their peak, decay—
thus the warning: *"Pride in strength is unaligned with the Dao,
and must be halted."*
*Halting* means *cessation*.
*—Exegesis:* *Halting* means *cessation*.

If it is not the true Dao, one must cease and not pursue it.

**Daoist Canon: Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao/Way* (卷之五 complete)**

#1: Original reads *"亡"* (wáng), should be *"云"* (yún).
#2: Original reads *"伐"* (fá), should be *"代"* (dài).

**Daoist Canon: Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao/Way* (卷之六)**
*Briefed by the recluse Gu Xuan of Wu Commandery*

The wise do not speak,
*—Annotation:* The wise value action over speech.
*—Exegesis:* Those who grasp the Dao, comprehend its subtle principles—
they know that reason transcends words,
thus they do not speak.

Hence, *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The Dao cannot be questioned,
nor can questions be answered—
this is called *wuwei* (non-action)."*
*—Rhythmic Explanation:* Meaning the Dao is beyond articulation.

Those who speak do not know.
*—Annotation:* A tongue outpaces four horses—
many words bring many calamities.
*—Exegesis:* Those who cling to verbal definitions
and seek reason in words alone
cannot fathom the Dao’s transcendence of speech and symbols,
thus they do not know.

Hence, *Zhuangzi* says:
*"If one questions the Dao and receives an answer,
they do not know the Dao."*
*—Rhythmic Explanation:* Meaning the speaker does not grasp its singularity.

The Dao is known by the Yellow Emperor.

*—Annotation:* He who blocks the *兑* (duì, "joy" or "mouth"),
and shuts his gates,
*—Annotation:* Those who block and seal
desire to cut off its source.
*—Master’s Commentary:* Those who attain enlightenment
have no attachment to the Dao,
nor do they cling to words,
thus it is said: *"He who blocks the *兑*."*
Since there is no attachment,
the gates of craving are closed.

*—Exegesis:* *Blocking* means silencing speech,
*closing* means restraining the six emotions.
*—Rhythmic Explanation:* Meaning to seal the nine orifices,
to preserve essence and guard *qi*.

*—Annotation:* When human nature sharpens its desires,
one must recall the Dao’s *wuwei*,
to blunt and halt them.

*—Exegesis:* To stop avarice and rivalry.

*—Annotation:* *纷* (fēn, "entanglement"), those who nurse grudges endlessly,
must recall the Dao’s simplicity and detachment
to dissolve and explain them.

*—Exegesis:* To release resentment and anger.

*—Annotation:* Even with singular insight,
one must harmonize it to make it dim,
not to dazzle and confuse others.

*—Exegesis:* To accommodate the ignorant and vulgar.

*—Annotation:* One must not separate oneself as exceptional.

*—Exegesis:* To blend with worldly affairs.

The preceding sentences have already been fully explained;
now, the text is briefly appended without further elaboration.
Thus, these words are repeated,
to emphasize their relevance to the path of learning.

This is called *玄同* (*xuán tóng*).
*—Annotation:* *玄* (xuán, "mysterious"), is heaven.
If one acts as above,
it is said they align with heaven’s Dao.

*—Exegesis:* Having already subdued body and mind,
they next harmonize light and obscure their traces,
thus their conduct is complete and virtuous,
and they accord with the mysterious principle.

*—Master’s Commentary:* *光* (guāng, "light"), is wisdom.
*尘* (chén, "dust"), is folly.
Ordinary beings adorn their wisdom to dazzle others,
and indulge their folly to invite suffering,
but the sage harmonizes light without dazzling,
and aligns with dust.

Hence, they cannot be approached with intimacy,
*—Annotation:* They do not take pride in honor,
nor do they lament solitude.
*—Master’s Commentary:* *玄同* is without bias,
thus they cannot be approached with intimacy.

Hence, they cannot be shunned with distance;
*—Annotation:* Their focus is on stillness, without desire,
and they bear no grudges against others.
*—Master’s Commentary:* They float universally with the multitude,
thus they cannot be shunned with distance.
*—Exegesis:* The Dao resonates with the mysterious,
and the realm of knowledge is doubly severed—
having forgotten both self and others,
they also transcend the notions of intimacy and distance.

They cannot be exploited for gain,
*—Annotation:* Their body does not crave wealth and nobility,
nor their mouth the five flavors.
*—Master’s Commentary:* Without desire,
they cannot be exploited for gain.

They also cannot be harmed;
*—Annotation:* They do not compete with the strong for advantage,
nor do they vie with the bold for *qi*.
*—Master’s Commentary:* Without desire to contest,
they cannot be harmed.
*—Exegesis:* For gain and harm
are tied to life and death,
existence and annihilation—
how much more so when they concern profit and loss.
Hence, *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Do not pursue gain,
nor shun harm."*

They cannot be elevated to nobility,
*—Annotation:* They do not govern in chaotic times,
nor serve in corrupt courts.
*—Master’s Commentary:* They embody the Dao naturally,
thus they cannot be elevated to nobility.

They also cannot be debased to lowliness.
*—Annotation:* They do not ride on power to become arrogant,
nor do they bend their will when thwarted.
*—Master’s Commentary:* They are pure without stain,
thus they cannot be debased to lowliness.
*—Exegesis:* For wealth and nobility
arise from honor and disgrace—
thus praise and blame do not move them,
nor do they tremble at favor or insult,
hence they cannot be ranked as noble or ignoble,
for nobility and ignobility are only labels of the heart.

Thus, they are noble throughout the world.
*—Annotation:* Their virtue is such
that even emperors cannot make them subjects,
nor lords bend them—
they float with the world,
adapt to survive,
and avoid harm,
thus they are noble throughout the world.
*—Master’s Commentary:* They embody the Dao without obstruction,
and forget words to let reason flow freely—
their sharpness and entanglements are dissolved,
their light and dust are harmonized—
since they defy intimacy and distance,
and transcend nobility and ignobility,
they are thus noble throughout the world.
*—Exegesis:* Having dispelled both intimacy and distance,
and emptied their minds of gain and harm,
they do not concern themselves with praise or blame,
nor do they harbor thoughts of nobility or ignobility—
thus the common folk bear them with reverence,
and all ranks gladly promote them without fatigue,
hence the world honors and values them.

They govern the realm with uprightness,
*—Annotation:* *以* (yǐ, "reach"), heaven appoints those of upright conduct
to rule over states.
*—Exegesis:* *以* (yǐ, "use"), governance means laws and teachings,
*治* (zhì, "order"), is to harmonize and regulate.
The sage leads the world and interacts with beings,
adapting to circumstances and wielding power—
the Dao is used to deploy troops and implement strategy,
wisdom to regulate the state.
This is the era of *pausing arms and refining culture*.

They use the *奇* (*qí*) to wage war,
*—Annotation:* *奇* (qí, "strange"), is deceit—
heaven appoints those who practice deception
to wage war.
*—Exegesis:* *奇* (qí), is covert deceit.
When disorder must be quelled,
war must be waged—
war does not reject deception,
it relies on stratagem and guile.
This is the era of *pausing culture and refining arms*.

War harms itself. A state is like the body. To take the world without action—
*—Annotation:* To appoint those who act without doing as rulers of the world.

*—Exegesis:* Governing the world through non-action is most noble. If one uses laws and teachings to rule, or deceit and stratagem in war, these are all contrary to the Dao. Only through non-action and non-doing can one take the world.

*—Commentary:* The Way of governance adapts to circumstances like a passing shelter or a sacrificial dog—if grasped too tightly, it only increases harm. Better to remain in non-action, centered in the *Gushu* [1], neither wielding arms nor culture, yet ruling from the hall of state with effortless ease. Thus, things transform without blemish, and the people sing in harmony. The art of governance lies here.

How do I know the world is thus? By this.
*—Annotation:* *This*, meaning the present—Laozi says, "How do I know the will of heaven is so?" I know it by what I see today.

*—Exegesis:* *This* refers to the reasoning below.

*—Commentary:* The argument assumes: "How do I know that governing the world must be through non-action?" The reasoning below reveals it.

The more taboos a land enforces, the poorer its people grow.
*—Annotation:* *Land* refers to the ruler; *taboos* mean prohibitions. Excessive restrictions breed deceit, and many prohibitions make the people cunning, deceiving one another for survival—thus poverty.

*—Explanation:* This speaks of artificial governance.

*—Commentary:* Harsh laws multiply offenders, disrupting livelihoods and deepening poverty.

Those who govern themselves cannot follow their true nature but cling to prohibitions, lacking inner virtue—thus poverty.

When the people wield many tools, the state grows confused.
*—Annotation:* *Tools* means *power*—when the people hold much power, their vision is dazzled, their ears deceived, and trust between ruler and subjects erodes, leading to chaos.

*—Exegesis:* *Tools* refers to schemes. If rulers rely too much on cunning, the people respond with deceit, deepening the state’s confusion.

When people rely on cleverness, strange devices proliferate.
*—Annotation:* *People* refers to rulers and feudal lords who favor cleverness—engraving palaces, carving garments—so strange devices arise, and the people below imitate, adorning gold and jade, embroidering colors, endlessly innovating.

*—Commentary:* *Cleverness* means deceitful schemes. *Strange devices* are war machines. If rulers favor war, the people follow, inventing strange devices to earn glory. Those who govern themselves indulge in cleverness, seizing others’ lands, and their divisive hearts only worsen corruption. This sentence further explains the use of war.

When laws proliferate, thieves multiply.
*—Annotation:* *Laws* means luxuries. If luxuries abound, farming declines, and hunger and cold follow—thus thieves multiply.

*—Exegesis:* Having lost non-action, laws become stricter, and those who exploit them become thieves—how could they not multiply?

*—Honor’s Note:* Luxuries are what laws protect. If gold and jade are prized, thieves will rise.

*—Chen’s Note:* It is natural: excessive taboos disrupt balance, many tools shift power downward, cleverness breeds deceit, and more laws only invite greater corruption.

Thus the Sage says:
*"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves,*
*—Annotation:* *Thus the Sage says*—referring to the following.

*"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves."* The Sage speaks of cultivating the Dao in harmony with heaven, making no artificial changes, yet the people naturally refine themselves.

*—Explanation:* This means preserving nature so that *yuanqi* [2] flows freely.

*—Commentary:* If the ruler remains detached and non-acting, the people naturally transform, abandoning vice for virtue. Laozi, being a Sage, modestly attributes this transformation to the *Shenghua* [3], hence *Zhuangzi* says: "Metaphorical speech is nineteen out of twenty."

*"I impose no tasks, yet the people grow rich,*
*—Annotation:* *I impose no tasks*—meaning no forced labor or conscription—so the people secure their livelihoods and prosper.

*—Explanation:* This means the body’s *form* and *qi* flourish when unrestrained.

*—Commentary:* With no artificial demands and no burdens, the four classes [4] settle into their work, the world harmonizes, taxes are light—how could they not prosper?

*"I value stillness, yet the people align themselves,*
*—Annotation:* The Sage says, *"I value stillness"*—without speaking or teaching, the people naturally become loyal and upright.

*—Explanation:* This means the heart remains empty of deceit, so *qi* resides within the form.

*—Commentary:* If the ruler cherishes stillness and does not disturb the people, they inherit pure customs and return to righteousness.

*"I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity."*
*—Annotation:* *I desire nothing*—constantly rejecting ornamentation, dressing plainly—so the people follow, becoming unadorned.

*—Explanation:* This means the mind, undisturbed by desires, remains steadfast, so *jingqi* [5] is pure and unexhausted.

*—Commentary:* If the ruler is frugal and unselfish, the people know contentment and simplicity, returning to natural virtue.

From *"Thus the Sage says"* onward, these lines collectively explain the meaning of *"taking the world without action."*

Their governance is obscure yet profound,
*—Annotation:* Their governance is broad and unrestrictive, obscure yet deep—

their people are sincere and rich.
*—Annotation:* Broad governance makes the people sincere and abundant, living in harmony.

The commentary states:
*"Mùn-mùn"* means expansive and ample.
*"Chún"* means simplicity and sincerity.
It speaks of the ruler acting without interference, governance broad and unrestrained—
so the people, following transformation, are all sincere and unadorned.

When governance is *chá-chá*,
*—Annotation:* Governance is urgent and hasty, its words pressing upon the ears—
the people become *quē-quē*.
*—Annotation:* Governance hasty and urgent—
the people, unable to sustain life, grow thin and scattered daily.

*—Commentary:* *Chá-chá* means strict and swift.
*Quē-quē* means decay and dispersion.
When the ruler favors action, governance becomes oppressive and abrupt—
the people suffer its violence, thus many perish and scatter.

To govern oneself, one must embrace emptiness, forgetfulness, and ease—
not clinging to a hasty, urgent mind.

Fate as fortune’s foundation,
*—Annotation:* *Yǐ* means "from."
For misfortune arises from fortune—
when people face calamity and repent, blame themselves,
practice virtue, and follow the Way,
fortune arrives, and misfortune departs.

Fortune as misfortune’s hidden seed.
*—Annotation:* Fortune lies concealed within misfortune—
when people grow proud from fortune,
fortune departs, and misfortune comes.

*—Commentary:* *Yǐ* means "from," *nì* means "concealed."
When governance is *mùn-mùn*, fortune is invited;
when *chá-chá*, misfortune is summoned.
These three matters stem from the mind—
fortune lies within misfortune,
misfortune hides within fortune—
their principle is not distant.

Who knows their ultimate end?
*—Annotation:* Misfortune and fortune cyclically generate—
who knows their final limit?

There is no rectitude.
*—Annotation:* *Wú* means "not"—
the ruler, failing to rectify himself, brings ruin to the realm.

*—Commentary:* *Shú* means "who."
The signs of fortune and misfortune arise from good and evil.
Karma undetermined, retribution follows—
thus the wheel turns through the Three Realms,
returning through the Six Paths,
in myriad transformations—
who knows their end?

The superior sage, mindful of saving others,
embodies this rectitude,
awakens to the Profound Mystery,
and does not become the cause of fortune or misfortune—
thus, no retribution of fortune or misfortune comes.
Hence, *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Misfortune does not arrive, fortune does not come—
misfortune and fortune are nonexistent;
who would suffer calamity?"*

Now, why the endless cycle?
Because they do not embrace the rectitude of the Way.

Rectitude returns as deceit,
*—Annotation:* *Qí* means "deceit"—
when the ruler is unrectified,
even if the people are rectified,
they in turn corrupt the ruler’s deceit.

*—Commentary:* *Qí* means "hollow deceit."
Even if one studies rectitude with sincerity,
clinging to its name while failing to forget it,
it does not align with reality—
thus it becomes hollow deceit.

Virtue returns as omens of disaster.
*—Annotation:* Even virtuous people revert to omens of calamity.

*—Commentary:* Though one acts virtuously,
still clinging to names and words,
contradicting true principle,
becoming a portent of misfortune—
thus *Zhuangzi* says:
*"To act for sound and name is to become a portent of misfortune."*

*—Metu’s Note:* If one seeks virtue yet becomes a portent,
it is the virtue of name alone.

*—Annotation:* Those who attain the Dao’s fortune
yet fail to uphold unity
soon grow proud and swollen—
evil intent resurfaces.

The people’s delusion has long endured.
*—Annotation:* The ruler’s confusion and loss of rectitude
has lasted for ages.

*—Annotation:* The world’s people cannot uphold unity,
deceived by deceit and falsehood,
losing fortune and inviting misfortune—
this has been longstanding, not just today.

*—Commentary:* The vulgar and coarse
become portents and deceitful
through their stupidity and delusion—
their error is without beginning,
not merely this life.

Thus the *Xī Shēng Jing* says:
*"Such delusion has endured long."*

Therefore, the Sage is square yet does not cut,
*—Annotation:* The Sage walks the square path of rectitude
to guide the people—
not to sever or harm them.

*—Annotation:* "Square" refers to the rectitude of unity—
guard it firmly, practice it enduringly,
never harming oneself with deceit.

*—Commentary:* The Sage embodies the Dao’s rectitude,
setting the standard for the people,
adapting to circumstances, guiding without coercion—
never ruling or forcing them to conform.

This is the Sage’s admonition,
urging all to cultivate.

Frugal yet not harmful,
*—Annotation:* The Sage’s conduct is pure and clear,
using it to transform the people—
not to harm them.

*—Commentary:* Mysteriously attuned to the empty, illusory nature of things,
free from greed or attachment,
elevated and pure,
avoiding the filth of the world.

Thus, cold and filth are both discarded,
greed and purity forgotten—
neither frugal nor impure,
neither pure nor filthy—
hence *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Great purity knows no fear,"*
and *"Frugal purity is untrustworthy."*

*—Annotation:* "Pure" refers to the clarity of *qi*.
Impurity cannot obstruct the Dao’s practice.

Straight yet not arrogant,
*—Annotation:* *Sì* means "to press"—
though the Sage bends to others,
he does not assert himself.

*—Commentary:* *Sì* means "to press."
Naturally upright and refined,
his essence untainted by deceit—
yet he bends to circumstances,
not forcing his own straightness.
Thus, the previous chapter says: *"Great straightness seems crooked."*

*—Annotation:* The function of unity is balanced—
following the heart’s flexibility,
not measuring by rigid rules.

Illuminating yet not dazzling.
*—Annotation:* Though the Sage possesses singular insight,
he remains as if obscured—
not blinding others with brilliance.

*—Annotation:* The Sage’s transformation is subtle—
not imposing square rectitude,
not staining others with impurity,
not pressing his straightness,
not dazzling with light—
but cultivating within himself,
while the world transforms naturally.

*—Commentary:* Wisdom’s light shines everywhere,
yet he conceals his brilliance,
not flaunting it before others,
forgetting even his own illumination.

Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: *"The brilliance of the slippery doubt is a trap the Sage perceives and confines."*

To govern the people—
*—Annotation:* This refers to the ruler’s desire to administer the populace.

To serve the Dao—
*—Annotation:* Serve, here meaning *use*. One must employ the Way of Heaven, follow the Four Seasons.

There is nothing better than **frugality**.
*—Annotation:* *Frugality* (啬), to cherish and conserve.

In governing the state, one must cherish the people’s wealth—
not indulge in **Qin’s extravagance**,
*—Annotation:* *Qin’s extravagance*, referring to the wasteful policies of the Qin state.
in cultivating oneself, one must cherish **qi** and **spirit**—
not abandon oneself to dissipation.

*—Annotation:* Heaven, the natural order.
*Style*, law.
There is nothing better than **moderation without excess**.
*—Annotation:* The Sage aligns with Heaven’s Way above,
transforms the common folk below—
employing the supreme law of **wuwei** (无为).

Only through **frugality** does one gain early **virtue**—
*—Annotation:* Early, to precede others;
**virtue**, attainment.

Only through **frugality** and cherishing the people’s wealth
does the populace find peace.
Cherishing **qi** and **spirit**,
one attains the Way of Heaven first.

*—Annotation:* How does one gather the people?
By wealth—
thus, through careful conservation,
those from all quarters come bearing burdens and arrive,
early serving their ruler.
*—Annotation:* Serve, to submit in service.

*—Annotation:* This **wuwei** method alone
can benefit both self and others—
applied to personal cultivation, it subdues **demons and trials**;
applied to state governance, it brings distant lands into submission.

Early **virtue** is called **deep accumulation**—
*—Annotation:* To first attain Heaven’s Way
is to deeply accumulate **virtue** within oneself.

*—Annotation:* Deep, profound and weighty.
Accumulation, layered accumulation.
To internally subdue **demons and trials**,
externally bring distant regions under control,
one must layer deeds and cultivate **virtue**—
its power profound and weighty,
only then can distant lands submit.

*—Annotation:* The Sage’s accumulated **virtue**
draws all under Heaven to his service—
then there is none he cannot subdue.

*—Annotation:* *Kè* (克), to be capable.
*—Annotation:* Those harboring deceit and evil
are subdued through **unity of qi** and its accumulation.
*—Annotation:* *Kè* (克), to conquer, also to attain.
Layered deeds and **virtue**,
self-benefit and benefit to others,
without loss—
internally and externally subdued,
none fail to conquer.

*—Annotation:* Through **unity of qi** and its accumulation,
evil is expelled and diseases cured—
thus, none fail to conquer.

If none can conquer,
then none know its limits—
*—Annotation:* If none can be conquered,
then none can fathom the depths of one’s own **virtue**.

*—Annotation:* One who understands **corresponding principles**
finds none beyond the reach of **Dao’s profound and distant power**—
none can know its ultimate bounds.

*—Annotation:* Through **unity of qi** and its accumulation,
evil is expelled and diseases cured—
none can know its full extent,
thus one’s life endures long.

If none know its limits,
then one can establish a state—
*—Annotation:* If none can fathom the depths of one’s **virtue**,
then one can secure the land and its people,
bringing governance and blessing.

*—Annotation:* When all principles are harmonized,
their depths and distances are boundless—
thus, one can rule a state and transform the people,
becoming the sovereign of kings and lords.

The foundation of a state,
one can endure forever.
*—Annotation:* State and body are analogous;
**mother**, the Way.
If one preserves the Way within the body—
**qi** unexpended,
the Five Spirits untroubled—
then one can endure long.

*—Annotation:* As sovereign of a state,
nurturing all under Heaven,
treating all as his children,
hence called **mother**.

Though **virtue** and deeds may be exalted,
if they are achieved without attachment,
and **wuwei** remains pure and subtle,
then one can endure forever.

This is called **deep-rooted and firm-founded**—
*—Annotation:* One who takes **harmony** (熙) as root,
**refinement** (精) as foundation,
like a tree—
if its roots are not deep, it is uprooted;
if its foundation is not firm, it falls—
must deeply conceal his **qi**,
firmly guard his **refinement**,
never letting it leak or disperse.

the **Dao of enduring life and long vision**.
*—Annotation:* Those with deep roots and firm foundations
are the **Dao of enduring life and long vision**.

*—Annotation:* Root, origin.
Foundation, trace.
The root can generate the foundation—
using this analogy, the origin gives rise to the trace.
To elaborate: the origin is **deep-rooted**,
its progression is **firm-founded**.
If roots are not deep, they become precarious;
if foundations are not firm, they scatter.
It is because roots are deep that one endures long,
because foundations are firm that one’s vision lasts—
this explains why the Sage’s **virtue** and **Dao** are both perfect,
hence concluding with the **Dao of enduring life and long vision**.

*—Annotation:* Vision, illumination.

To govern a great state,
one must treat it as cooking a small fresh delicacy.

「*—Annotation:* Fresh, fish.

To cook small fish, one does not remove its entrails,
does not scrape its scales,
does not dare to prod it—
lest it disintegrate.

To govern a state with excess brings chaos below;
to govern the body with excess scatters the essence.

*—Annotation:* Cook, to boil.
Fresh, fish.
It is said that if one prods a small fish while boiling, it will disintegrate,
but if left undisturbed, it remains whole—
a metaphor: governing with *wuwei* brings great peace,
while agitation leads to ruin.

To act in the Way across the world,
its spirits lose their menace.
*—Annotation:* When one governs the world with virtue and the Way,
ghosts and spirits dare not manifest their malevolence against people.

*—Annotation:* *Lì* (莅), to oversee.
It is said that those who govern with righteousness
prevent malevolent spirits from causing harm.

*—Annotation by Gu (顾):* Spirit refers to their supernatural efficacy.

When one governs the world with the Way,
the land is at great peace—
in such times, ghosts and spirits lack the power to manifest harm.
When one cultivates the Way in the body,
true illumination attains unity—
those who attain unity are unharmed by spectral forces.

It is not that their spirits lack efficacy,
but that evil cannot enter the righteous—
thus, they cannot harm natural beings.

*—Annotation by Yu (御):* Earlier, it was said that their spirits lack menace,
not that they are extinguished and devoid of spirit—
only that they dare not manifest harm to people.

*—Annotation:* Spirit, supernatural efficacy.
It is not that these spirits lack efficacy,
but that they bring blessings to people
without harming anything.

For governing the body,
*xièméi* (馅魅) refers to restless, licentious thoughts.
It is said that when one governs the body with righteous principles,
restless thoughts cannot harm virtuous conduct—
even if the mind stirs, true illumination remains,
and thus cannot harm conduct.

*—Annotation by Jiéjiě (节解):* It is not that spirits lack efficacy,
but that the Way resides in the person—
thus, their spirit cannot harm them.

It is not that their spirit cannot harm people,
nor that the Sage cannot harm people.
*—Annotation:* It is not that spirits cannot harm people,
but that the Sage, in office, does not harm people—
thus, ghosts dare not interfere.

*—Annotation by Yu (御):* Ghosts that manifest harm are so because
the Sage has acted contrary to the Way.
Now, ghosts do not manifest harm because
the Sage acts with *wuwei* and purity.

*—Annotation:* All manuscripts originally read *yì* (亦),
but Zhang Xi’s and Master Lu’s texts read *zhī* (之).
Since *yì* and *zhī* resemble each other in script,
*zhī* was mistakenly written as *yì*—now corrected to *zhī*.

This means that it is not that these spirits do not harm things,
but that the Sage, acting in the Way, can subdue evil—
thus, ghosts do not harm people.
Power lies in the Sage’s righteousness—
hence, it is also said that the Sage does not harm people.

For governing the body, it is said that
even if the mind stirs, it cannot harm stillness—
for Sage-wisdom subdues it, so though it moves,
it cannot disturb the tranquil.

*—Annotation by Jiéjiě (节解):* It is said that when a person’s conduct aligns with divine clarity,
there are no hidden faults within—
thus, ghosts cannot harm them.
There are no outward crimes—
thus, the Sage does not punish them.

Heavenly spirits stand guard outside the body,
protecting its form within.
Original *qi* is undifferentiated—
all aid in governing the body.

One’s conduct follows Heaven above:
the head wears the luminosity of sun and moon,
stars and constellations arrayed within the body.
Spirit and breath nourish on *yùyīng* (玉英).
Thus, the two do not harm each other.
*—Annotation:* Ghosts and the Sage—
both do not harm each other.

Hence, virtue reciprocates.
*—Annotation:* Those who do not harm each other
allow people to thrive in the Yang,
ghosts to thrive in the Yin—
people preserve their life and nature,
ghosts preserve their spirit—
thus, virtue reciprocates.

*—Annotation:* The two—ghosts in the Yin, people in the Yang—
each finds its place, unharmed,
guarding its domain.
With no transgression between them,
people extend virtue to ghosts,
ghosts extend grace to people—
virtue and kindness circulate,
thus they attach to one another in harmony.

For governing the body,
one stills agitation and returns to tranquility,
fulfilling one’s conduct.
Since movement and stillness are simultaneous,
what is there to restrain?

Now it is clarified:
restraint without restraint,
response without expectation—
not responding yet responding.

A great state is the confluence of the world.
*—Annotation:* To govern a great state is like the river and sea,
which reside in the lowest flow,
not opposing the minutest currents.

The world’s gathering place.
*—Annotation:* A great state is where all under Heaven assemble.

*—Annotation by Jiéjiě (节解):* The *nìwán* (泥丸) is both great state and small state—
receiving from above, it irrigates the *dāntián* (丹田),
which is the earthly frontier.

*—Annotation:* A great state refers to a realm of ten thousand chariots,
*jiāo* (郊), the outer walls.
*Zhī* (之), to go.
It is said that a great state, vast and accommodating,
is like the river and sea—
the river and sea lie beneath all currents,
thus all streams rush toward them.
A great state, acting in the Way with humility and gentleness,
thus all nations come and pay homage,
revering virtue and filling the outer walls.

*Běn* (本) is also written as *jiāo* (交).
A great state, acting in humility,
thus exchanges with small states.

The world’s gathering place is the receptive.
The receptive, ever still, overcomes the assertive.
Soft, yielding, and harmonious—
not competing.
Women can submit to men because Yin overcomes Yang.
Their tranquility comes from not seeking first.

*—Annotation:* The world’s frontier—
echoing the preceding text to generate the following sentence.
The receptive is female, still;
the assertive is male, restless.
It is said that a great state can make all nations submit and assemble
only by employing gentle, receptive stillness—
thus overcoming restless assertiveness.
If it acts with rigidity, it cannot govern.

Thus, it is known that governing the body and the state
must prioritize gentleness and compliance.
With stillness as the foundation.
*—Annotation:* The Yin Way values tranquil stillness as humility.

Thus, a great state, humbling itself to small states,
takes them in.
*—Annotation:* Those who humble themselves
constantly attract others.

The *Commentary* states: **"以"** means **"to employ."** **"下"** means **"humility."** **"取"** means **"to assimilate and transform."** The Sage-King, ruling over great states, skillfully employs humility and gentleness, thus assimilating all nations—near and far—into submission, bringing tribute through layered tributaries. Is this not fitting?

When small states humble themselves to great states, they gather under their protection.
*—Annotation:* This means that regardless of a state’s size, if it practices humility and nurtures others, it will have no faults.

*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* The great state takes the small as its subjects and servants; the small state takes the great as its allies and support.

*—Master Jie’s Explanation:* The *Upper Seal* (泥丸) represents the great state, while the *Lower Elixir Field* (丹田) represents the small. Practicing the *One Way*, one closes the breath and swallows saliva, letting it descend to the *Lower Elixir Field*, where it transforms into blood, blood into essence, and essence into *qi*. Through embryonic breathing, it is drawn upward to replenish the brain, then pushed and drawn outward, spreading like clouds across the four seas. Thus, the great takes from the small, and the small gathers under the great.

The small state, knowing its own lowliness, guards its place with feminine gentleness, gathering within the great state out of reverence for its virtue and moral influence.

Thus, sometimes the great takes, sometimes the small gathers.
*—Annotation:* **"下"** refers to the great state humbling itself to the small, and the small humbling itself to the great, alternately taking each other through righteousness.

*—Commentary:* **"或"** means **"indeterminate"**—when the small state employs gentleness, it gathers under the great; when the great employs humility, it takes the submission of all nations. Though both use humility, their methods differ—one gathers, the other takes.

The great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others; the small state seeks only to enter and serve.
*—Annotation:* If the great state does not lose its humility, it will encompass and assimilate the small, making them its subjects and servants.

*—Commentary:* The great state employs humility without ulterior motives—only to love and embrace the small states. The small state employs gentleness without hidden intentions—only to enter the great state’s embrace, admiring its virtue and seeking to serve.

Both achieve what they desire: the great state should thus be humble.
*—Annotation:* Great and small states each seek what they desire, yet the great state should especially practice humility.

*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* One seeks subjects and servants; the other seeks allies and support. Both obtain what they desire, yet the great state must always guard against arrogance, hence it should be humble.

*—Commentary:* The two refer to great and small states—both encompassing and serving, each fulfilling their desires. Though both may use gentleness, the great state should particularly emphasize humility. Why? For things naturally press down the great—small things do not overpower the great. Thus, those who overpower the great should humble themselves, adhering to the principle of lowering the high.

*—Master Jie’s Explanation:* The two refer to the *Upper Seal* (泥丸) and the *Lower Elixir Field* (丹田). The *Upper Seal* desires descending *qi*, while the *Lower Elixir Field* desires ascending *qi*, together forming a single divine transformation.

The *Dao* is the profound essence of all things.
*—Annotation:* **"奥"** means **"to conceal."** The *Dao* is the hidden repository of all things, containing all within itself.

*—Commentary:* The *Dao* is the wondrous, boundless principle of emptiness and flow, the innate nature of all beings. **"奥"** means both **"profound"** and **"hidden"**—it speaks of the *Dao* generating all existence, encompassing all life, without exclusion, thus serving as the hidden repository of all things.

The treasure of the virtuous,
*—Annotation:* The virtuous person regards the *Dao* as their bodily treasure, thus daring not to stray from it.

*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* The virtuous know that adherence to the *Dao* brings flourishing, while abandonment brings ruin. Thus, they cherish and practice it without ceasing.

*—Commentary:* Those who cultivate the *Dao* perceive true nature, obtaining the *Mystic Pearl* in the *Crimson Stream*, hence they treasure and honor it.

The refuge of the unvirtuous.
*—Annotation:* The *Dao* is the unvirtuous’ last reliance. Even in calamity or peril, they may yet repent and humble themselves.

*—Commentary:* **"保"** means **"to uphold."** The vulgar, entangled in material desires and competitive striving, cannot uphold the *Dao*. Their speech is flattering and deceitful, like market haggling—buyers seek swift purchase, sellers swift sale. Unable to guard true humility, they prioritize self over others, yet still claim noble conduct, thus distancing themselves from the *Dao*.

Sweet speech can be sold in the market,
*—Annotation:* Only sweet speech can be traded in the marketplace. Once the exchange is complete, the buyer and seller part ways—no further harmony remains. Sweet words and flattery are sought eagerly by buyers, swiftly sold by merchants.

Noble conduct can elevate a person.
*—Annotation:* **"加"** means **"to distinguish."** A person of noble conduct can set themselves apart from the common, yet this is insufficient to elevate the *Dao*.

*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* Sweet and pleasing words can be traded like goods in the market; noble and lofty conduct can distinguish a person. By analogy, the Sage uses sweet, virtuous teachings and lofty, detached conduct to transform the unvirtuous—just as merchants sell goods, people follow in emulation.

*—Commentary:* The unvirtuous, with shallow hearts and hollow speech, adorn themselves with flattery like market traders seeking profit, yet they cannot uphold true humility. They place themselves before others, boast of their own nobility, and domineer over people. Such conduct, far from the *Dao*, only distances them further.

Why abandon those who are unvirtuous?
*—Annotation:* Though unvirtuous, they should be transformed by the *Dao*. In the age of the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people—virtue and teaching were pure.

*—Master Yu’s Exegesis:* Even the unvirtuous can be transformed by virtue. Why abandon them?

*—Commentary:* **"奚"** means **"why."** The Sage’s *Dao* is boundless in its reach, universally salvific. Though beings may be unvirtuous, how could there be abandonment? Its compassion covers all, aiding without exclusion.

Thus, the Son of Heaven is enthroned,
and the Three Ministers are appointed,
*—Annotation:* To transform the unvirtuous through teaching.

*—Commentary:* Having aided without exclusion, the proper order of the world must be established. Thus, the Son of Heaven is enthroned to govern all affairs, and the Three Ministers are appointed to discuss the *Dao*.

To harmonize *Yin* and *Yang*,
and to refine and flourish in governance,
with intent on guiding all classes like a vessel,
and protecting all life from poison.

Since the opening of the cosmos, the True Sovereign has manifested in the world, embodying the *Dao* and, through expedient means, assuming the role of emperor, establishing an administration to emulate the Three Pure Ones.

Though one may present a jade tablet held aloft—
preceded by a team of four horses—
it is not as good as simply sitting and advancing this *Dao*.
*—Annotation:* Even if one arrives with a high-capped carriage bearing a perfect jade tablet, it is still inferior to sitting in quietude and cultivating this *Dao*.

*—Commentary:* *"Jade tablet"* refers to holding a round, flawless jade tablet. *"Four horses"* denotes a single carriage. In ancient times, when summoning a scholar, one would first purify oneself and present the jade tablet, then dispatch a carriage drawn by four horses. Though such offerings bring wealth and honor, they pale in comparison to the effortless, forgetful cultivation of this *Dao*. Why? For cultivating the *Dao* grants longevity, while wealth and honor are but great calamities. Hence, Guangchengzi said: *"Human life in the world is like a cloud soaring in the sky—its presence fleeting, vanishing in an instant. Measured by this standard, it is better to withdraw far from such things."*

*—Master Gu’s Note:* To maintain a spotless reputation is called "noble conduct," but one who prides himself in conduct may surpass others—yet this is not the ultimate.

*—Master Sun’s Note:* Fine words can outvalue all goods, and noble conduct can elevate one above others. Yet the *Dao* expressed in words is bland, without flavor. The Sage acts without action, teaches without speech. How could he adorn speech to please the ears of the people or embellish conduct to dazzle the eyes of all things?

Why then was this *Dao* held in such esteem in antiquity?
It is not that seeking brings attainment,

「Annotations: The reason antiquity held this *Dao* in such high regard was not that one could seek it daily and attain it through distant travels, but rather that it could be found within oneself. ○Master Gu notes: There is no need for distant searching—one seeks it daily, but its accumulation lies within the self, and its attainment rests in the heart. Its profound enlightenment resides within me. Would one only seek to avoid guilt when already guilty? ○Annotations: "Guilt" refers to suffering in turbulent times under tyrannical rulers, where arbitrary punishments prevail. Cultivating the *Dao* can resolve resentment and spare one from the evils of the multitude. ○Kumarajiva and others say: By dedicating oneself to the virtuous *Dao*, one avoids all evils. Thus, it is held in highest esteem by the world. ○Annotations: With profound *Dao* and virtue, nothing escapes its nurturing embrace—preserving life, governing the realm with ease, and remaining serene in non-action. Hence, it is worthy of the world’s reverence. ○Master Yu notes: The *Dao* lies in enlightenment, not in seeking. Unlike wealth or silk, which can be sought daily and obtained, it is said that one does not seek it daily to attain it. Once enlightened, there is no burden of guilt—why wait for guilt to arise before seeking release? Thus, it is worthy of the world’s reverence.

○Exegesis: Why did the sages of old hold this *Dao* so precious? Simply because it is not a matter of seeking it day by day to obtain it. The enlightened see the *Dao* before them, while the deluded wander countless kalpas without comprehension. Even if, from beginningless time, one has been bound by birth and death, by guilt and retribution—once returned to the source, all is instantly freed. Such divine power is beyond measure, hence the world reveres it as the object of all inquiry.

Non-action (*wuwei*), ○Annotations: Achieved through natural unfolding, requiring no artificial contrivance.
○Exegesis: In perfect harmony with the heart’s essence, it never loses its true illumination. Illuminating all action, it is itself the very nature of non-action. Thus, non-action is action, and action is non-action.

○Concise Analysis: To say "one does not act" means one does not act for the self.

Non-doing (*wu shi*), ○Annotations: Refraining from preparation, eliminating distractions and unnecessary affairs.
○Exegesis: "Affairs" refers to sensory phenomena—colors, sounds, material forms—all things. In perfect alignment with true emptiness, one’s illumination does not contradict stillness. Though engaged in affairs, there is no attachment to them.

○Concise Analysis: To say "one does not do" means one does not act for others.

Flavorless (*wu wei*), ○Annotations: Deep contemplation and foresight—savoring the *Dao*’s essence.
○Exegesis: "Flavor" denotes attachment and clinging. With both root and object emptied, color and taste both cease. Though one may still engage with taste, there is no lingering obstruction.

Great and small, much and little, ○Annotations: A call to observe restraint and discipline.»

「One wishes to invert greatness into smallness, abundance into scarcity—this is the Dao/Way of nature. Returning resentment with virtue.

○Annotations: Cultivating goodness and the Dao/Way, extinguishing calamity before it arises.
○Concise Analysis: For those who act without doing (*wu wei*), engage in affairs without attachment, and savor taste without lingering—if greatness and smallness, abundance and scarcity, are both kept within their proper bounds, then there is no transgression to provoke resentment. If one’s mind arises with chasing sensory phenomena and exceeds one’s natural portion, harming one’s true nature, then there is neither greatness nor smallness—all become resentment and anger. Now, since one abides by one’s portion and maintains perfect harmony, one can thus return resentment with virtue.

○Exegesis: Resentment is anger. Returning means recompensing. From the beginning of existence onward, great and small offenses, abundant and scarce deeds—if one seeks to cry out and eliminate them all at once, one must first apply the three kinds of virtuous mind: *wu wei*, non-attachment to affairs, and non-lingering with taste. Then the Three Worlds are emptied, all dharmas are tranquil and void, and the unity of self and other is realized—what lingering remains? Hence the previous chapter states: "By what virtue/power can one be freed from crime?" This is what it refers to.

Endeavoring the difficult in the easy, ○Annotations: To seek to accomplish difficult matters, one must first practice in easy ones before they are perfected.

○Exegesis: *Tú* means to plan and measure. *Nán* refers to retribution for misdeeds. *Yì* denotes the initial mind.

It states that those who wish to plan and dispel the hardships of evil paths must first observe the initial mind. If there is no action, there will be no retribution.

The great surpasses the small.
○Annotation: To accomplish great deeds, one must begin with small ones—calamities arise from the small.

○The Master said: Those who indulge their passions and desires find all actions difficult and all matters great. Now, if one seeks to plan and measure their difficulties, to undertake their greatness, they must act when their nature is yet undispersed and their boundaries untransgressed—that is, when they are still in their easy and small beginnings.

○Exegesis: *Xiǎo* means small. Great calamities originate from the minute. This clarifies that to extinguish evil fruits, one must first eliminate the causes.

Great undertakings under heaven must begin with what is easy.
Great affairs under heaven must begin with what is small.
○Annotation: This elucidates the earlier precepts.

Thus, the Sage never undertakes what is great.
○Annotation: This reflects humility.

○Exegesis: *Zuò* means to initiate. The hardships and retributions of the world necessarily arise from the easy mind—speaking of how a single thought of the initial mind can easily create karma. Hence, great calamities must begin with the small, growing from the subtle to the manifest, gradually forming great conflicts. Therefore, to remove evil retributions, one must first restrain the initial mind.

Thus, one can achieve the great.
○Annotation: All under heaven converge upon it.

「Lightly given promises are bound to lack trustworthiness. ○*Annotation*: One does not lightly speak.

○*Exegesis*: It speaks of those who lightly promise—losing the substance of self-respect. ○*Commentary*: Here, a metaphor is introduced. *Nuo* (诺) means "to assent or agree." *Guǎ* (寡) means "few or scarce." Those who lightly assent to others’ requests will inevitably be few in truthfulness, later incurring the blame of untrustworthiness.

To act lightly will bring many hardships. ○*Annotation*: One must not neglect potential calamities. ○*Commentary*: Lightly assenting to others leads to few truths; acting lightly in deeds will later bring many hardships.

○*Commentary*: This combines the metaphors. Lightly assenting to others leads to untrustworthiness, just as lightly committing sins will invite the heavy retribution of the Eight Difficulties (八难). Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao must be solemn and deliberate, never reckless.

Thus, the Sage finds even difficulty hard,
○*Annotation*: The Sage weighs actions and matters with great deliberation, seeking to block their origins.
and so never faces difficulty.
○*Annotation*: The Sage’s lifelong absence of hardship arises from deep avoidance of harm.

○*Commentary*: *Yóu* (犹) means "still" or "even." The Sage of true Daoic cultivation has no difficulty or ease, yet still finds difficulty hard and does not act upon it, thus avoiding blame for hardship. How much more so for the common folk who indulge their passions!

This is a general precept for the Sage and the vulgar alike.
Hence, Guo Xiang’s annotation on *Zhuangzi* states: "The Sage, though entering fire, does not feel its heat, yet never once stepped into the fire." Again, he says: "Avoiding fire is not fleeing its heat—this is the very meaning."

Its tranquility is easy to uphold,
○*Annotation*: In governing oneself and the realm, the tranquil is easily maintained.
○*Commentary*: *An* (安) means "tranquil," *chí* (持) means "to uphold." When the Sage’s spirit is still and undisturbed, no desires have yet arisen—at such times, it is very easy to cultivate and guard against them.

its latent state is easy to plan against;
○*Annotation*: When desires or calamities have not yet taken form, they are easy to forestall.
○*Commentary*: *Zhào* (兆) means "signs or indications," *móu* (谋) means "to plan or strategize." Though desires may arise in the mind, no form has yet manifested in the external world. At this moment, one should restrain the mind and return to stillness, for the karmic deed has not yet taken root—thus, it is easy to plan against and consider.

its frailty is easy to shatter,
○*Annotation*: Calamities and chaos have not yet stirred in the morning or evening, nor have desires shown in form or expression—like something brittle, they are easily broken away.
its subtlety is easy to disperse.
○*Annotation*: Before matters become manifest, they are small and easily scattered.

○*Commentary*: *Cuì* (脆) means "brittle or fragile." Like a gourd whose fruit has not yet hardened, it is fragile and easily broken. When the initial mind arises with defilements, it is the same—karmic deeds are shallow and thus easily removed.

To act upon it before it arises,
○*Annotation*: When one seeks to do something, one must act before its sprouts take root.
○*Commentary*: *Wéi* (为) means "to cultivate or study." The Sage’s cultivation and guarding are constant, even before desires arise—this explains *its tranquility is easy to uphold*.

to govern it before it falls into disorder.
○*Commentary*: *Luàn* (乱) means "disorder," referring to the mind being ensnared by karmic deeds and thus clouded and disordered. Now, though the mind may sprout defilements, no form has yet appeared in the external world. At this very moment, it is easy to align with reason—this explains *its latent state is easy to plan against*.

A tree with arms’ embrace grows from a hair’s end;
○*Annotation*: From small to great.
○*Commentary*: A hundred-surrounding tree (百围之木) originates from a hair’s tip (毫微). This metaphor illustrates how threefold heavy conflicts (三涂重衅) arise from a single defiled thought. The tree is used as a metaphor because, though it grows from nothingness, it is not inherently "nothing"—it is formed by the four dusts (四尘). Likewise, defilements arise from emptiness, yet are not truly "nothing," for they are shaped by the four dusts as well.

Troubles and vexations are thus of no inherent substance,
○*Annotation*: They emerge from emptiness.

nine-tiered towers are built from piled earth;
○*Annotation*: From low to high.
○*Commentary*: *Céng* (层) is akin to "levels." A nine-level tower (九级之台) begins with a single basket of soil (累土). This metaphor illustrates how nine nights of calamity (九夜之祸) arise from a single defiled thought—it deeply warns all learners to be cautious.

and a thousand-li journey begins beneath one’s feet. ○*Annotation*: From near to far.

The *Commentary* reads: The *River-Upper* text states "thousand-li," but here it speaks of "hundred *rèn*."[^1]
For seven *chi* is called a *rèn*, and a lofty peak of a hundred *rèn* in height begins with its first step.
Treading the eightfold gates of suffering arises from a defiled mind.
The prior analogy has yet to be fully realized.

The one who acts brings about its ruin.
*Annotation*: To act in affairs corrupts spontaneity; to act in principle corrupts benevolence and compassion; to act in form corrupts spirit.

The one who clings loses it.
*Annotation*: Clinging to gain leads to its cessation; clinging to enmity forfeits one’s life; obstinacy yields nothing, while yielding returns it.

The *Master’s Response* says: All worldly attachments are deluded and clinging; unable to forget or release, every movement becomes attachment. The clinger seeks possession, yet reason dictates loss.

The *Commentary* explains: The Supreme Dao is empty and boundless, without action or attachment. Worldly minds are inverted, with attachment and contrivance. Action leads to peril, hence "ruin"; clinging contradicts reality, hence "loss."

Thus, the Sage acts not, and so knows no ruin;
*Annotation*: The Sage does not indulge in superficial adornments, nor covet material gains or harm others, and thus knows no corruption.

acts not in clinging, and so knows no loss.
*Annotation*: The Sage teaches the ignorant with virtue and aids the poor with wealth, holding nothing back, and thus loses nothing to others.

Yet the people, in their pursuits, often nearing completion, bring ruin upon themselves.
*Annotation*: "From" means "to act." The people’s affairs, nearing fulfillment, grow greedy for position and fame, indulgent in excess, and thus self-destruct.
The *Commentary* states: "Near" means "close." All people engage in contrived endeavors, restless and competitive, distinguishing and selecting without foresight. Ever seeking near-completion, they begin but do not finish, hence their frequent ruin.

The *Book of Documents* says: Few have beginnings, but fewer still have endings.
To be as vigilant at the end as at the beginning brings no ruin.
*Annotation*: The end must mirror the beginning; do not grow slack.

The *Commentary* warns: This admonishes learners to fortify their Dao-heart, steadfast from beginning to end, lest there be ruin. Within the Six Perfections, this is the fourth.

Thus, the Sage desires what others do not;
*Annotation*: The Sage desires what others reject—when others seek display, the Sage hides brilliance; when others seek ornamentation, the Sage seeks simplicity; when others lust after wealth and form, the Sage seeks virtue and power.

values not the hard-to-obtain treasures;
*Annotation*: The Sage does not dazzle with adornments nor devalue stone while esteeming jade.

learns what others do not learn;
*Annotation*: The Sage learns what others cannot—while others learn cunning, the Sage learns spontaneity; while others learn to govern the world, the Sage learns to govern the self, guarding the true Dao.

and reverses the errors of the multitude.
*Annotation*: The multitude learns in reverse—errors become ends, reality becomes superficial. To reverse is to restore the original and true.

The *Master’s Response* says: The Sage does not seek excessive learning.

The *Commentary* elaborates: The Sage’s luminous insight comes from Heaven, differing from common wisdom. Knowing all phenomena as empty and illusory, no desirable object appears. Thus, within desire, no desire-form is seen. Having no desire for what others desire, how could jade and silk be valued?

Further, comprehending true and false as undifferentiated, the Sage neither learns nor fails to learn. Learning is not learning, and not-learning is learning—no distinction between learning and not-learning. Hence, the *Western Ascension Sutra* says: *"I learn nothing, yet I illuminate spontaneity."*

The *River-Upper* text reads *"reverse,"* while other editions say *"prevent."*[^2] To prevent is to guard against the calamities of those who cling to contrivance, unable to forget learning.

To aid the natural unfolding of all things,
*Annotation*: Teaching people to return to their original and true nature, desiring to assist the natural essence of all things.

yet daring not to act.
*Annotation*: The Sage’s movements follow naturally, daring not to contrive, lest they stray from the root.

The *Commentary* explains: "Aid" means "assist" and "guide." All beings inherently possess a correct and natural disposition, yet delusion and attachment cause them to stray from the Dao and lose authenticity. Now, the Sage intends to teach the method of "learning not to learn," guiding them to return to their roots. Though the Sage exhausts principle and fulfills nature, there is neither action nor inaction.

Now, when the Sage is said to "not act," it is to assist and guide the multitude, restoring them to their natural principles. Hence, it is said, "daring not to act."

「吴郡征士顾欢述
The recluse Gu Xuan of Wujun says:

古之善为道者，
The ancients who excelled in cultivating the Dao,

注：谓古之善以道治身及治国者。
*Annotation*: refers to those ancient sages who skillfully governed themselves and their realm through the Dao.

非以明民，
were not those who enlightened the people,

注：不以道教民明智奸巧也。
*Annotation*: nor those who taught the Dao to the people to sharpen their cunning and cleverness.

将欲愚之。
but sought to make them simple.

注：将以道德教民，使质朴不诈伪也。
*Annotation*: They aimed to instruct the people with virtue/power, so that their innate simplicity would not be corrupted by deceit.

○御曰：人君善为道者，
The Imperial Commentary states: The sovereign who excels in cultivating the Dao,

非以其道明示於人，
does not openly display his Dao to the people,

将导之以和，
but guides them through harmony,

使归复於朴，
restoring them to their original simplicity,

令如愚也。
making them appear as though they were simple.

○疏：为道，犹修道也。
The *Commentary* explains: "Cultivating the Dao" is the same as "practicing the Dao."

言古昔善修道之士，
Those ancient sages who practiced the Dao—

实智内明，
though inwardly possessed of profound wisdom,

无幽不烛，
penetrating all hidden depths,

外若愚时，
yet outwardly appearing simple—

不耀於人，
did not flaunt their wisdom before others,

闭智塞聪，
concealing their intelligence and dulling their perceptiveness,

韬光晦迹也。
hiding their brilliance and obscuring their traces.

民之难治，
The people are difficult to govern,

以其智多。
because their cleverness is excessive.

注：以其智太多而为巧伪。
*Annotation*: Their excessive wisdom leads to cunning and deceit.

○御曰：君将明道以临下，
The Imperial Commentary states: When the sovereign seeks to clarify the Dao and rule over his subjects,

人必役智以应上，
the people must employ their cleverness to meet his expectations,

智多则诈兴，
and the more they rely on their cleverness, the more deceit arises,

是以难理。
making governance arduous.

○疏：治，理也，智，分别也。
The *Commentary* explains: "Govern" is the same as "order," and "wisdom" here refers to "discrimination."

言众生所以难治者，
The reason the people are difficult to govern is that

为心多分别，
their minds are filled with excessive discrimination,

不能虚忘，
and they cannot empty themselves of it through forgetfulness,

故难化也。
thus rendering them hard to transform.

故以智治国，
Therefore, when wisdom is used to govern the state,

国之贼；
it becomes the state’s ruin.

注：使智慧之人治国政之事，必远道德，妄作威福，为国之贼也。
*Annotation*: Those who are wise in worldly affairs, when entrusted with state governance, will stray from virtue/power and arbitrarily wield authority, becoming the state’s ruin.

不以智治国，
But when wisdom is not used to govern the state,

国之福。
it becomes the state’s blessing.

注：不使智慧之人治国之政事，则民守正直，不为邪饰，上下相亲，君臣同力，故为国之福也。
*Annotation*: Then the people uphold righteousness, unadorned by deceit; the ruler and subjects are in harmony, and the sovereign and ministers unite in effort, making it the state’s blessing.

○御曰：若不用巧智之臣，
The Imperial Commentary states: If the sovereign does not employ clever and cunning ministers,

但取纯德之士，
but instead selects those of pure virtue/power,

使偃息蕃魏，
allowing them to rest and flourish like the grass and weeds,

弄丸难解，
while the trivial matters of governance remain unsolved like a child’s plaything,

自然智诈日薄，
then cleverness and deceit will naturally diminish day by day,

淳朴日兴，
while sincerity and simplicity will flourish,

人和则年丰，
and when the people are harmonious, the land will yield abundant harvests,

故是国之福也。
thus becoming the state’s blessing.

○疏：若用明智察俗以理物者，
The *Commentary* explains: If one employs those who are clever and discerning in worldly affairs to govern the people,

既乖淳和，
they will contradict the natural harmony of the Dao,

人同贼害，
and the people will align with the harm of deceit.

言无为至虚至静，
It is said that the Sage who governs through non-action attains supreme emptiness and tranquility,

忘心遣智，
abandoning the mind and relinquishing cleverness,

尸居玄默，
remaining as still as a corpse in profound silence,

以斯御世者，
and ruling the world thus—

其唯上德乎。
this is what is called "supreme virtue/power."

以此格量，
By this standard of measure,

胜劣可见，
the superior and inferior become apparent,

治国既尔，
and if this is the way to govern the state,

身亦宜然。
then it is also the way to govern oneself.

知此两者，
Understanding these two principles—

亦楷式。
is also a model.

注：两者谓智与不智也，常能知智为贼，不智为福，是治身治国之法式也。
*Annotation*: These two refer to wisdom and non-wisdom. If one always knows that wisdom is ruinous and non-wisdom is a blessing, this is the model for governing oneself and the state.

○御曰：役智诈则害於人，
The Imperial Commentary states: Employing cleverness and deceit harms the people,

任纯德则福於国，
while entrusting to those of pure virtue/power blesses the state.

人君能知此两者，
If the sovereign understands these two principles,

委任纯德之臣，
and delegates authority to ministers of pure virtue/power,

是亦为君楷模之法式也。
then this too is the model for sovereigns.

○疏：两者前文智与不智也。
The *Commentary* explains: These two principles are wisdom and non-wisdom from the previous text.

能知智为贼，
If one knows that wisdom is ruinous,

不智为德，
and non-wisdom is virtue/power,

则可为修身之楷模，
then one can serve as a model for self-cultivation,

治国之洪范也。
and as the grand standard for governing the state.

○节解曰：谓去智守愚，
The *Summary of the Dao* states: This means abandoning cleverness and preserving simplicity,

则病除气盛，
so that ailments are dispelled and *qi* flourishes,

此治身之法式也。
this being the model for governing oneself.

常知楷式，
If one always understands these models,

是谓玄德。
then this is called "Daoist virtue/power."

注：玄，天也，能知治国治身之法式，是谓与天同德也。
*Annotation*: "Daoist" (*Xuán*) is the same as "Heavenly." Those who understand the models for governing the state and oneself are said to align with Heaven’s virtue/power.

○疏：常能知无分别为治身之楷式者，
The *Commentary* explains: Those who constantly understand that non-discrimination is the model for governing oneself

可谓深玄之大德也。
can be called the "supreme virtue/power of profound Daoism."

玄德深远，
The virtue/power of the profound Dao is deep and boundless,

注：玄德之人深不可测，远不可极也。
*Annotation*: The person of profound Daoist virtue/power is unfathomable in depth and boundless in extent.

与物反，
and contrary to all things.

注：玄德之人与万物反异，万物欲益於己，玄德欲施与人。
*Annotation*: The person of profound Daoist virtue/power is opposite to all things; while all things seek to benefit themselves, Daoist virtue/power seeks to give to others.

○节解曰：谓一之深远，
The *Summary of the Dao* states: This refers to the depth and boundlessness of the One,

乃在太清，
which resides in the *Ta Qing* (Supreme Clarity),

降下绛宫，
descending into the *Jiang Gong* (Vermilion Palace),

入子形中，
entering the form of the child,

物皆枯死，
while all things wither and die,

子独长生，
the child alone endures eternally,

故与物反也。
thus being contrary to all things.

○疏：冥真契道谓之玄德，
The *Commentary* explains: "Daoist virtue/power" is the name for the mysterious truth that aligns with the Dao.

穷源极际谓之深远，
"Deep and boundless" refers to exhausting the source and reaching the utmost limits.

深远之智，
The wisdom of profound Daoism,

智乖於俗，
is contrary to worldly cleverness,

故与物反。
thus being contrary to all things.

然后乃至大顺。
Only then does one attain *Da Shun* (Great Harmony).

注：玄德之人，与万物反异，故能至大顺，顺天理也。
*Annotation*: The person of profound Daoist virtue/power, being contrary to all things, thus attains Great Harmony, which aligns with Heaven’s principles.

○疏：顺有两种，一顺於理，二顺於俗，
The *Commentary* explains: There are two kinds of harmony: one is harmony with principle, the other is harmony with the world.

顺理则契於妙本，
Harmony with principle aligns with the wondrous root,

顽俗则同尘降逵。
while harmony with the world aligns with dust and descends to the mundane.

问曰：前言反物，后言顺俗，
*A Question* asks: Earlier it says "contrary to all things," later it says "harmony with the world."

则前反后顺，
If "contrary" precedes "harmony," then

文岂类乎。
does the text not seem contradictory?

答曰：前言反者，
*The Answer* states: The earlier "contrary" refers to

此言明，
this explicit teaching—

不反而反，
not being contrary yet being contrary,

后言顺者，
the later "harmony" refers to

亦不顺而顺，
also not being harmony yet being harmony,

不顺而顺，
harmony that does not contradict principle,

顺不乖反，
and principle that does not contradict harmony—

不反而反，
not being contrary yet being contrary,

反不乖顺，
and not being harmony yet being harmony—

亦何所嫌也。
so what is there to object to?

问曰：经称大顺，
*A Question* asks: The text speaks of "Great Harmony,"

顺亦有大小乎。
does harmony not have degrees of greatness and smallness?

答曰：夫以顺对违，
*The Answer* states: Harmony is contrasted with defiance,

虽顺而小，
though it may be small harmony,

今不顺不违，
but when one neither defies nor aligns with worldly matters,

而违而顺，
yet both defies and harmonizes—

顺不异违，
harmony is not different from defiance,

违不乖顺，
and defiance is not contrary to harmony—

所以出处语默，
thus, in conduct and speech, one follows the Dao silently,

唯道是从，
conforming only to the Dao,

和光同尘，
blending one’s brilliance with the dust,

而恒顺於理，
yet always harmonizing with principle,

不问顺与不顺，
without regard to harmony or defiance,

不顺与顺，
or defiance and harmony—

一时皆顺，
all are harmonious in the present moment,

是故无顺无不顺，
thus there is neither harmony nor defiance,

而能顺能不顺，
yet one is capable of both harmony and defiance,

乃至非顺非不顺，
even reaching beyond harmony and defiance,

故名为大顺也。
thus it is called "Great Harmony."

江海所以能为百谷王者，
The reason the rivers and seas can be sovereigns of all streams is that

以其善下之，
they excel in humility.

注：江海以卑下，故众流共归之，若人民归就王者也。
*Annotation*: The rivers and seas, being lowly and humble, thus gather all streams, just as the people gather to a sovereign.

○疏：王，往也。
The *Commentary* explains: "Sovereign" means "to go toward."

百谷，百川也。
"All streams" refers to the hundred rivers.

言江海所以百川之所归往者，
The rivers and seas are where the hundred rivers converge because

以其善居洼下之地也。
they excel in dwelling in lowly and humble places.

人能退身谦下，
If a person can retreat in self, humble and lowly,

虚柔容物者，
and empty, yielding, and accommodating all things,

亦为苍生之所归往也。
then they too will be where the common folk converge.

故能为百谷王。
Thus they can be sovereigns of all streams.

注：以其卑下故能为百谷王也。
*Annotation*: Because of their humility and lowliness, they can be sovereigns of all streams.

○疏：此结成其义，
The *Commentary* concludes its meaning:

故经云：海为百川王。」
thus the text says: "The sea is the sovereign of all rivers."」

Thus the Sage desires to be above the people,
*The Annotation* explains: "Desires to be above the people."

yet speaks of humility;
*The Annotation* explains: "Follows the Way of the rivers and seas, abiding in humility and modesty."

They wish to have all beings
reside above themselves,
so they display a gentle demeanor,
constantly humbling themselves.

They desire to lead the people,
*The Annotation* explains: "Desires to be before the people."

yet place themselves behind them.
*The Annotation* explains: "They lead others while placing themselves last."

*The Commentary* explains: "To have beings before oneself, one must retreat in self and reside behind all things, hence the text says: *All who have not attained the Dao, I always do not hold in hope.* The former advances yet ends in arrogance, while the latter guards humility yet secretly progresses. Thus the Sage, though above the people,
*The Annotation* explains: "The Sage, though above the people as their ruler, does not oppress them with their exalted status, hence the people revere them without feeling burdened."

*The Commentary* further elucidates: "The Sage is tranquil, unassuming, and free from self-interest, with few desires. As their ruler, they govern with light taxes and minimal labor, so the people are not weighed down. Alternatively: The Sage’s virtue extends to all things, so the people bear and uphold them without chaos."

and before them,
*The Annotation* explains: "The Sage, though before the people, does not obscure them with their brilliance, so the people love them as they would parents, never harming them."

*The Commentary* explains: "As rulers who stand before all things, they bring harmony to the realm, making the people sing and strike the earth in joy. The world is peaceful and prosperous, their benefits vast, yet none are harmed. Alternatively: The Sage’s virtue is boundless, the people willingly embrace it, cherishing their blessings—how dare they harm?"

thus the world delights in upholding them without tiring.
*The Annotation* explains: "The Sage’s love and benevolence are deep, treating the people as their own children, hence the world takes joy in supporting them as their ruler, never wearying."

Because they do not contend,
*The Annotation* explains: "The heavens do not weary of the Sage, for the Sage does not compete with others for precedence."

the world cannot contend with them.
*The Annotation* explains: "All speak of my Dao as great, yet I feign foolishness as if unworthy."

*The Commentary* explains: "The *River Above* text reads *xìao* (肖), while other families render it *xiào* (笑). *Smile* refers to the Sage’s natural harmony and profound enlightenment, so all beings cannot but revere them as the Great Sage. Yet why does it seem so? Only because, in dealing with others, they are humble and yielding, never boasting or scoffing, hence the result."

*Master Gu* states: "Because they do not align with others, it says *unworthy* (不肖). The Sage’s Dao is exalted and virtuous, indeed worthy of greatness, yet they conceal their traces like dust, their presence indeterminate—neither appearing wise nor foolish, hence *unworthy*."

For only the great
seem unworthy.
*The Annotation* explains: "Only those whose virtue is truly great would harm themselves by boasting, so they feign foolishness as if unworthy, making no distinctions or divisions, not demeaning others while elevating themselves. If *worthy* (肖) were long-standing,
*The Annotation* explains: *Worthy* (肖) means *good* (善). It refers to those who excel in debate and benevolence, yet elevate themselves in speech, implementing meticulous governance—such as the petty scholars of old."

their refinement is indeed shallow.
*The Annotation* explains: "Only the petty-minded are refined in debate and benevolence, not the noble."

*The Commentary* explains: "The Sage alone, with their vast virtue, does not boast or scoff before others. If they did, they would long be among the petty. *Worthy* (肖) means *good*—the people cannot follow the good Dao because of the Sage’s greatness. The Sage’s greatness is why they cannot practice the good Dao, for they must long remain humble and lowly."

*Master Gu* states: "The Great Sage is beyond comparison. If their form had a fixed nature and their wisdom a constant measure, then their Dao would be constrained and rigid—this is the mark of the petty, not the sublime Great Sage."

I possess three Treasures,
treasures that I hold fast.
*The Annotation* explains: "The Sage says, *I possess three Treasures*, which they embrace and rely upon."

*The Commentary* explains: "Thus the Sage’s virtue is great, yet they do not boast or align themselves with others, because they depend on the Three Treasures, which are precious and held firm."

The first is **cí** (慈, compassion),
*The Annotation* explains: "Loving the people as their own children."

*The Commentary* explains: "Compassionate thoughts for all beings, delivering them from suffering and bringing them joy—this is the Dao’s Treasure."

The second is **jiǎn** (俭, frugality),
*The Annotation* explains: "Taxing and taking as if from oneself."

*Master Yu* states: "Compassion means broad salvation; frugality means sufficient resources."

*The Commentary* explains: "Content with little, knowing satisfaction, guarding one’s portion without greed—this is the scripture’s Treasure."

The third is **bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān** (不敢为天下先, not daring to be first under heaven).
*The Annotation* explains: "They hold to humility, never taking the lead."

*The Commentary* explains: "Humility and feigned weakness, placing others before themselves, retreating to benefit others—this is the Teacher’s Treasure."

*Master Jié* states: "It refers to the Treasures of **jīng-qì-shén** (精气神) within a person’s form, which they preserve to sustain life."

Compassion makes them **yǒng** (勇, courageous),
*The Commentary* explains: "Within them lies great compassion, outwardly extending to all beings, hence their courage to enter the Three Realms and rescue all."

frugality makes them broad;
*The Annotation* explains: "The sovereign’s body, if frugal, makes the people’s daily use vast and great."

*The Commentary* explains: "All phenomena are empty and illusory; they unite without greed, maintaining simplicity and purity, hence their virtue is vast."

and not daring to be first under heaven,
*The Annotation* explains: "Not daring to be first under heaven."

thus they can fulfill their role as vessels of the long-lasting.

「The *Annotation* explains: "To fulfill the role of *long-lasting vessels* refers to those who have attained the Dao. I can be the foremost among those who embody the Dao."

*The Imperial Commentary* states: "The virtues of compassion and frugality, when tempered with humility, grow ever brighter. When their brilliance is shared with others, none will weary of it, hence they can become the sovereign vessels of the long-lasting."

*The Commentary* elaborates: "It is only because of their courage to rescue the common folk that they retreat from the world to dwell alone in the Celestial Capital, becoming the foremost among all the sages. When descending to the mortal realm, they occupy the august position of the Nine Ranked, the sovereign of the divine vessel. Now, however, they abandon their compassion and courage—
*The Annotation* explains: "In this age, they combine the seven aspects of compassion into mere martial prowess."
*The Commentary* elaborates: "They discard compassion and instead revel in fierce valor."

They abandon their frugality and vast virtue—
*The Annotation* explains: "They combine their frugality into mere extravagance."
*The Commentary* elaborates: "They forsake their simplicity and instead indulge in greed for worldly things."

They abandon their humility and instead seek to be first—
*The Annotation* explains: "They combine their self-effacement into a rush to lead."
*The Commentary* elaborates: "They abandon the mind of retreat and instead hasten toward advancement."

Thus, they court death.
*The Annotation* explains: "Such actions inevitably lead one to the path of destruction."
*The Commentary* elaborates: "Summing the three transgressions above—rejecting the Three Treasures—they plunge into the Three Abysses, hence the declaration: *Thus, they court death.*"

Now, compassion: in war, it brings victory; in defense, it ensures steadfastness.
*The Annotation* explains: "Those who embody compassion inspire the people’s loyalty, uniting hearts and minds. Thus, in war, they conquer their foes, and in defense, they remain unshaken."
*The Imperial Commentary* states: "When leading armies with compassion, soldiers are moved by gratitude, ensuring swift triumph."
*The Inner Explanation* adds: "The six senses are like soldiers; if they are not ensnared by the six dusts, they achieve victory."
Again, when defending with compassion, the people’s hearts align, making the defense unbreakable.
*The Inner Explanation* adds: "Guarding with a compassionate, empty mind fortifies the Dao-heart, rendering it impervious to assault."

When Heaven intends to save them, it shields them with compassion.
*The Annotation* explains: "Heaven rescues those who practice compassion, endowing them with its nature to aid themselves."
*The Imperial Commentary* states: "To wage war and defend with compassion is not merely to unite the people—Heaven’s Way is profound, and it too will save and protect them."
Victory in war is Heaven’s salvation.
Steadfastness in defense is Heaven’s guardianship.
All this is because of compassion, hence it is said: *When Heaven intends to save them, it shields them with compassion.*
*The Commentary* elaborates: "The Celestial Sovereign of the Dao rescues and protects those who practice compassion, using compassion itself to guard them."

Thus, within the Three Treasures, compassion takes precedence, and among the Four Virtues, it is paramount. Truly, compassion’s meaning is vast!

The ancient wise warriors did not rely on force,
*The Annotation* explains: "It is said that moral cultivation is valued over martial might."
*The Imperial Commentary* states: "士 (*shì*) means *affairs*. Those who govern well through the Dao prioritize virtue, hence they do not emphasize force."
*The Commentary* elaborates: "The ancient wise cultivated the Dao in stillness and retreat, never abandoning compassion for martial valor."

The skilled warriors do not rage,
*The Annotation* explains: "Those who wage war through the Dao suppress evil in their hearts and cut off misfortune before it arises, harboring no anger."
*The Imperial Commentary* states: "If conflict is unavoidable, one must respond—but compassion makes it skillful, hence no reliance on wrath."
*The Sectional Explanation* adds: "This means *closure*—harmonizing the essence, so all spirits rejoice."
*The Commentary* elaborates: "Those who penetrate the emptiness of all phenomena can subdue enemies before they arise. Their wondrous body transcends both compliance and defiance, hence they experience neither joy nor anger."

The skilled conquerors do not contend,
*The Annotation* explains: "Those who conquer through the Dao draw near with benevolence and seek the distant with virtue, never clashing with enemies, who thus submit of their own accord."
*The Imperial Commentary* states: "Military triumph lies in harmony; harmony means no contention."
*The Sectional Explanation* adds: "This means *unifying the mouth*—all ghosts bow in submission, hence *no contention*."
*The Commentary* elaborates: "If one is untouched by the dusts, it is called conquering enemies. Since there is neither joy nor anger, what is there to contend over?"

The skilled leaders place themselves below others.
*The Annotation* explains: "Those who skillfully employ others always practice humility."
*The Commentary* elaborates: "Those who embody humility are naturally followed by others, hence they can command their use."

Thus, the virtue of non-contention—
*The Annotation* explains: "This refers to the preceding point of placing oneself below others."
—is the very Dao of not contending for the realm.
*The Commentary* elaborates: "Not contending with others allows one’s own virtue to flourish; this concludes the section on skilled conquerors who do not contend."

This is called employing the strength of others.
*The Annotation* explains: "Those who place themselves below others can employ the strength of their ministers."
*Zhang’s Explanation* adds: "If one delights in leading others, they forget their own toil."
*The Commentary* elaborates: "Through humility and yielding softness, one does not exert dominance over others, yet others submit and serve one’s purposes; this concludes the section on skilled leaders who place themselves below others."

This is to align with Heaven,
*The Annotation* explains: "Those who practice this can match Heaven’s virtue."
*The Imperial Commentary* states: "The virtue of skilled conquest is non-contention, and employing others is using their strength. Thus, one can align with Heaven and claim the imperial title—this is the supreme Dao of antiquity."
*The Commentary* elaborates: "Align (*pèi*) means *to harmonize*. Heaven refers to *nature*."

The **extreme** is the **fruit of the Dao**.
It speaks of those who cultivate the Dao with skill—
profoundly embodying true emptiness,
penetrating the interplay of opposition and compliance,
not contending with things—
thus harmonizing with the ultimate principle of nature,
and attaining the **supreme Dao** of antiquity’s origin.
This is the **conclusion**.

On wielding arms, there is a saying:
*The Annotation* explains: "Chen’s martial teachings—
Laozi despised the age’s use of arms,
so he framed this principle under his own words."
*The Commentary* elaborates: "Wielding arms refers to **strategic wisdom**,
subduing and transforming beings—
also how the Sage employs the six senses
to engage with the dusty realm."

There is a saying—
its meaning lies in the following text.

I dare not act as the **initiator**,
*The Annotation* explains: "Initiator (*zhǔ*) means *first*—
I dare not first raise arms."
as but the **guest**.
*The Annotation* explains: "Guest means *yielding without leading*—
in wielding arms, one must follow Heaven’s movement before acting."
*The Chapter Explanation* states:
"Upper arms refer to **speech**,
lower arms refer to **subtle action**.
Empty speech harms oneself,
so one speaks in humility and restraint.
Lightly employing subtle action depletes one’s essence,
so one does not dare to lead but yields instead."

*The Annotation* explains:
"‘Master’ refers to **my own body**,
‘guest’ refers to **past defilements**—
speaking of how the roots and defilements are both empty,
and **self** and **phenomena** are all illusory.
Since there is no **self** to act upon,
nor any **defilements** to be stained,
I dare not advance an inch for fear of retreating a foot."

*The Annotation* explains:
"Advance" means **taking**,
"retreat" means **letting go**.
‘Little’ signifies **nothing**,
‘much’ signifies **something**."

Once **discriminating wisdom** and **phenomena** are both abandoned,
and **roots** and **defilements** forgotten,
the **Mystic Oneness** is realized,
free from the duality of **self** and **other**—
thus, there is nothing in **non-action** to be sought,
nor anything in **action** to be embraced.

This is called **"actionless action."**
*The Annotation* explains:
"If one does not cease, they become a **scourge to the world**—
though they may be executed, they are not **arrested** in their **non-action**."

*The Master’s Commentary* states:
"Retreating a foot as a **guest**,
not contending with things—
though one may respond to hostility,
it aligns with **actionless action**."

*The Annotation* explains:
Having abandoned all **deliberate action**,
and forgotten all **phenomenal perceptions**,
there is no **action** to be called **action**.

**Brandishing arms without arms,**
*The Annotation* explains:
"Though one might raise their arms in great anger,
it is as if they had **no arms to brandish**."

*The Chapter Explanation* states:
"Brandishing arms is meant to display anger,
but the virtuous warrior does not grow angry,
so it is as if they had **no arms to brandish**."

**Grasping weapons without weapons,**
*The Annotation* explains:
"Though one might wish to seize and wield them,
it is as if there were **no weapons** to hold."

Why?
To harm another’s people brings **retribution from Heaven**,
to face a **tyrannical ruler** is to risk **self-destruction**.
*The Master’s Commentary* states:
"Wielding weapons is meant to display killing,
but now **compassion** is the master—
so though one might grasp, it is as if there were **no weapons**."

*The Annotation* explains:
Detached from form and wisdom,
there are **no weapons** to be used.

**Yet no enemy remains,**
*The Annotation* explains:
"Though the mind may still **pursue** and **draw near**,
there is **no enemy** to engage."

**No greater calamity than despising the enemy,**
*The Chapter Explanation* states:
"This refers to those who **indulge in reckless conflict**—
they invite **ruin and disaster**."

*The Annotation* explains:
"Despising" means **contempt and aggression**,
"enemy" refers to **past phenomena**.
To **despise** and **cling to defilements**
brings the **karmic retribution of the Three Realms**—
thus, the **great calamity** arises.

**Despising the enemy risks losing my treasure,**
*The Annotation* explains:
"Near" means **imminent**,
"treasure" refers to **the body**."

*The Chapter Explanation* states:
"Treasure" means **vital essence and breath**—
to **despise the enemy** and **fight repeatedly**
leads to the **loss of vital essence**."

*The Annotation* explains:
"Near" means **exhaustion**,
"treasure" refers to the **Three Treasures** from the previous chapter.
Combining **compassion** with **courage** is called **provoking the enemy**,
which invites **great disaster**—
thus, the **Three Treasures** are utterly lost.

Therefore, when **arms are raised in conflict,**
*The Annotation* explains:
"Two armies **raise arms** against each other."

**One who acts with compassion will prevail.**
*The Master’s Commentary* states:
"Antagonize" means **to provoke**—
when two nations **raise arms** against each other."

*The Annotation* explains:
"If" means **when**,
"compassion" is **pity**.
"Antagonize" means **to provoke**—
speaking of how **roots and defilements** press upon each other,
raising **glances and expressions** in response.
Yet with a **great compassionate mind**,
one **emptily mirrors** the **phenomena before them**—
thus, **self** and **phenomena** are both forgotten,
all **dharma** becomes a **wondrous realm of victory**.

My words are **easy to know, easy to practice.**
*The Annotation* explains:
"Laozi says my words are **concise and easy to know**,
**brief and easy to practice**."

*The Annotation* explains:
"My words" refer to the previous chapter—
what is spoken is **not this**, yet it is **easy to know**.
**Actionless action** is **easy to practice**.

Yet **none in the world can know them, none can practice them.**
*The Annotation* explains:
"None" means **not**.
Laozi says they are **easy to know, easy to practice**,
yet the **multitude of beings** are **deluded and dull**—
none can **grasp** the **profound subtlety** of my teachings,
nor **follow** them in practice.

**Words have a root, affairs have a sovereign.**
*The Annotation* explains:
"My words have a **foundational origin**,
affairs have **rulers and subjects**—
those who do not know this are not without **virtue**,
but their **hearts have not returned** to the Way."

*The Master’s Commentary* states:
"Root" means **origin**,
"sovereign" means **master**.
Though **words** may diverge in **paths**,
they share the **root of emptiness**.
Though **affairs** may differ in **direction**,
they share the **mastery of stillness and simplicity**."

*The Commentary of Cai* states:
"Words take **non-speech** as their root,
affairs take **non-action** as their sovereign."

*The Master’s Commentary* states:
"Words" pertain to **principle**—
when **principle** is attained, **words are forgotten**,
so **non-speech** is the root.
"Affairs" pertain to **achievement**—
when **achievement** is complete, **no one claims credit**,
so **non-action** is the sovereign.

*The Annotation* explains:
"Words" are **scriptures and teachings**,
"sovereign" is the **Son of Heaven**.
Though **teachings** may be vast,
their **root** lies in the **Mystic Darkness**,
though **affairs** may be complex,
their **order** comes from the **sovereign**.
This **essence** is raised to show **ease in knowing**.

**Only the ignorant fail to know me.**
*The Annotation* explains:
"Only because the world is **ignorant**,
my **virtue and power** remain hidden—
**profound and wondrous**—
thus, they are **unknown**."

*The Master’s Commentary* states:
"Only because the world lacks **enlightenment**,
they fail to grasp my teachings of **non-speech and non-action**."

*The Annotation* explains:
"Not knowing me" is like **not knowing myself**.
Only because **beings are ignorant and dull**,
they cannot grasp my **profound words**.

**Few know me, thus I am precious.**
*The Annotation* explains:
"Few" means **rare**.
Only those who **grasp the Dao** can truly know me—
thus, I am **precious**.

*The Annotation* explains:
Most **ordinary minds** are **superficial and deluded**,
few truly **embody** the **sage’s teachings**.

**Then, this is the *Law* [法則].**
To follow my teachings and walk according to this *Law*,
to attain the sacred fruit—this is what is **precious**.

Thus, the Sage wears coarse cloth while treasuring jade within.
*The Annotation* explains:
Wearing coarse cloth means **humble exterior**,
treasuring jade means **rich interior**.
He conceals his treasure and virtue,
not revealing them to others.

*The Master’s Commentary* states:
Wearing coarse cloth means **obscuring his outward form**.
Treasuring jade means **illuminating his inner essence**.
Thus, few truly know me.

*The Explication* says:
The Sage values **virtue and power** while despising his form—
wearing skins and fur,
embracing the **One** within,
not coveting office or rank,
nurturing spirit and clarity within,
refining *qi* into jade,
solidifying essence into gold,
thus able to transform and ascend to the **Purple Palace**.

*The Master’s Commentary* states:
Coarse cloth is the **garment of the common**, jade is the **precious treasure**.
Ordinary minds truly do not know—
they feign wisdom outwardly like a **sheep in tiger’s skin**,
this is the **disease of virtue**.

*The Annotation* explains:
To **know** the Sage’s words,
to **understand** the Sage’s teachings,
to **practice** and **realize** them fully—
this is how one becomes a Sage.
Coarse cloth is the attire of the rustic,
jade is the precious gem—
outwardly blending with the dust,
wearing coarse cloth.
Inwardly, the heart is **empty and tranquil**,
treasuring jade.
Treasuring jade—
though dwelling in the vulgar world, it remains **ever true**.
Wearing coarse cloth—
the heart is **empty and concentrated**, engaging with others.

**Knowing while feigning ignorance** is **supreme**.
*The Annotation* explains:
To **know** yet speak of **not knowing**—
this is the **height of virtue**.

*The Annotation* explains:
The Sage **harmonizes with the Recondite Mystery**,
his outward form does not stray from the **Root**,
he **penetrates emptiness and distance**,
knowing yet **without knowing**,
returning to the **Root’s emptiness and concentration**—
thus called **supreme**.

Hence, *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Who knows that you do not know?
How could I know?"*
**Not knowing while feigning knowledge** is **disease**.
*The Annotation* explains:
To **not know** yet speak of **knowing**—
this is the **disease of virtue**.

*The Explication* says:
Descending from the **Root** to outward form,
**not knowing** yet **knowing**,
engaging in affairs to relieve suffering—
thus called **disease**.

Only by **disease of disease** does one **not fall ill**.
*The Annotation* explains:
Only because the Sage **suffers from the disease of others’ forced knowledge**,
he does not **suffer himself**.

*The Annotation* explains:
The Sage has no **flaw of knowledge**,
while the common mind is **entangled in distinctions**—
suffering from the **disease of others’ disease**,
thus he speaks to the vulgar, expounding teachings,
his intent to **rescue the drowning**.
Already **not ill yet ill**, **ill yet not ill**—
hence it is said: **not ill**.

Thus, the Sage does not fall ill,
because he **suffers from the disease of others**—
thus he does not fall ill.

*The Annotation* explains:
The Sage has no **disease of forced knowledge**,
for he **constantly suffers** with those who bear this disease,
out of **compassion for them**—
thus he does not suffer himself.

The Sage possesses **enlightened, penetrating wisdom**,
yet **appears ignorant**,
to make all under heaven **simple, sincere, and true**,
each guarding their **pure nature**.

The petty man does not **understand this intent**,
yet **presumptuously acts in forced knowledge**,
seeking to **display himself**,
internally **injuring his spirit**,
shortening life and wasting years.

*The Master’s Commentary* states:
The vulgar, **grasping at forced knowledge**,
distinguishing and clinging—
wandering yet never returning—
truly lamentable.

Only the Sage **truly knows the Mysterious Root**,
**penetrates speech and teaching**,
alone able, through **compassionate benevolence**,
to **pity** the petty man’s **disease of forced knowledge**,
for he himself is **without disease**.

*The Annotation* explains:
The Sage can **empty and forget**,
**transcend both phenomena and wisdom**,
**penetratingly discern** while **riding the *qi***,
**ascending on clouds**,
**Root and form both empty and tranquil**—
what **disease** could bind him?

---
*The Annotated Commentary on the Dao De Jing* concludes **Volume Seven**,
begins **Volume Eight**.

**Volume Eight** of *The Annotated Commentary on the Dao De Jing*
continues:

Master Gu of Wu Commandery expounds:
If the people **do not fear minor harm**,
then **major harm** shall come.
*The Annotation* clarifies:
**"Harm"** refers to **calamity**.
If men **do not fear petty calamities**,
then **great calamities** shall come—
great calamities being **death** itself.
Those who fear it must **preserve their essence and nourish their spirit**,
**align with Earth and receive from Heaven**.

*The Annotated Commentary* elucidates:
**"Harm"** means **punitive authority**—
the laws and prohibitions of all the scriptures.
**Major harm** refers to the **three evil destinies**—
the cruel punishments of the **Northern Underworld (Tàlú and Lúchēng)**.
It speaks of how the **common folk**, unendured by scriptural precepts,
who **recklessly commit evils**,
shall surely face **the winds of retribution and great punishments**.

**Do not narrow their dwelling**—
*The Annotation* explains:
**"Dwelling"** refers to **the abode of the spirit**,
which must always be **broad and gentle**,
never **hasty or confined**.

**The *Jiéjiě* Commentary** states:
**"Do not narrow"** means, while **still alive in the mundane world**,
to **reside in deep mountains and vast marshes**,
where one may **cultivate one’s nature**.

**Lord Lu expounds:**
**"Do not narrow"** means to **banish passions and discard desires**,
so that **the empty chamber may give birth to purity**.

**Do not satiate their birth**—
*The Annotation* explains:
**"Birth"** refers to the **spirit**,
which arises from **essence and depends upon emptiness**,
delighting in **clarity and purity**.
If **diet is unregulated**,
or if one **abandons the Dao for sensual pleasures**,
then **perverse obsessions fill the body**,
**shortening life and scattering the spirit**.

**The *Jiéjiě* Commentary** states:
**"Satiate"** means to **reject**—
to **reject the love of *qi***,
for one **treasures essence as the treasure of life**.

**Lord Lu expounds:**
That which **the body generates** is **the spirit**.
**"Do not satiate"** means to **hold few private attachments and desires**,
so that **the spirit may not grow weary or exhausted**.

*The Annotated Commentary* concludes:
**"Satiate"** is **to abandon**.
**"Narrow"** is **to constrain**.

**"Residence"** is **settled abode**.
**"That which is generated"** is **the heart**.

It is said that those who cultivate the Dao must **settle the heart without attachments**, lest they **constrain it with narrow, inferior desires**, abandoning what they generate. Why? Though the body is **empty and illusory**, it is the **vessel for receiving the Dao**. One must neither **indulge in attachment** nor **reject with aversion**, for **indulgence clings to the realm of conditioned existence**, while **aversion drowns in the illusion of emptiness**. To **neither cling nor be defiled**, dwelling in the **Middle without dwelling in the Middle**—this is the **true practitioner of the Dao**.

Only **the one who does not satiate** is thus **unsatiated**.
**Annotation:** Only the one who **does not satiate the spirit**—who **cleanses the heart of filth**, **discarding desires**—is **unsatiated by the spirit’s dwelling**.

**Commentary:** The **domain of cultivation** is **neither existence nor emptiness**; thus, one **can cultivate it**. **Wisdom too** is **neither attached nor averse**; when **wisdom aligns with the domain**, it is **unsatiated**.

Thus, the **Sage knows himself**—
**Annotation:** **Knowing one’s own gains and losses**.
**without self-display**—
**Annotation:** **Not revealing virtue externally**, but **concealing it within**.
**Commentary:** When **wisdom aligns with the Dao’s domain**, one **penetrates the true source**, thus **knowing oneself**. The **Four Great Elements** are **borrowed and assembled**; in **sitting-forgetfulness**, the body **decays unnoticed**, hence **no self-display**.

**Self-love**—
**Annotation:** **Loving one’s body** to **preserve essence and qi**.
**without self-aggrandizement**—
**Annotation:** **Not seeking honor or nobility in the world**.
**Commentary:** **Nurturing true nature**, **not lightly staining it**, hence **self-love**. **Humility, quietude, and retreat**, **prioritizing others over oneself**—this is **not self-aggrandizement**.

Thus, **discard the former, take the latter**.
**Annotation:** **Discard self-display and self-aggrandizement**; **take self-knowledge and self-love**.
**Commentary:** **Discarding self-display and self-aggrandizement**, **taking self-knowledge and self-love**—this is **to instruct others through example**, hence the **language of discarding and taking**.

**Boldness in daring** leads to **death**—
**Annotation:** **Boldness in action** kills the body.
**Jiéjiě Commentary:** **Greed for sexual union**—seeking **sensual gratification**, **life and death alternate**—this is **boldness**. **Contempt for the Dao and neglect of the spirit** lead to **premature death**—this is **daring**. Both are **self-destruction**.

**Boldness in not daring** leads to **life**—
**Annotation:** **Boldness in refraining from action** preserves the body.
**Commentary:** **Boldness** is **fervent advance**; **daring** is **resolute action**. **Death** is **annihilation**; **life** is **longevity**. **Advancing the heart resolutely**—if **attached to worldly affairs**, it leads to **annihilation**; if the **heart is empty and indifferent, not daring to cling or defile**, then it is **longevity**.

These two—
**Annotation:** **Referring to daring and not daring**.

**Some bring benefit, some bring harm.**
**Annotation:** **Preserving life** is **benefit**; **destroying life** is **harm**.
**Commentary:** **"Some"** means **indeterminate**. **The two** refer to **daring and not daring**. **Speaking of resolute action without daring**—if one does not dare, it leads to **longevity**, hence **benefit**. If one **advances the body** and **clings to defilement**, it leads to **annihilation and death**, hence **harm**.

**What the Dao/Way abhors,**
**Annotation:** **Abhors action.**
**Who knows its reason?**
**Annotation:** **Who can know the Dao/Way’s intent**, hence **not daring to transgress it.**

**Commentary:** The **natural order**—**rewarding virtue, punishing licentiousness**—when **examining cause and effect**, none know its **ultimate arbiter**. Thus, even **sages find it difficult**.

**Annotation:** **Speaking of the sage’s enlightened virtue**, yet even they find **boldness and daring difficult**—how much more so those without sagehood who dare to act?

**Explanatory Resolution:** **Saying that the Dao/Way constantly abhors boldness and daring**, yet **loves timidity and weakness**, **cherishing life and qi**—who knows the Dao/Way’s intent?

**The Dao/Way of Heaven**—
**not contending yet naturally triumphant,**
**Annotation:** **Heaven does not contend with humanity over nobility**, yet **humanity naturally fears It.**

**Explanatory Resolution:** **The Dao/Way values harmony.**

**Commentary:** The **natural order**—though it **does not contend with things**, yet **those who are humble, retiring, and self-effacing** will **inevitably gain victory and good fortune.**

**Not speaking yet naturally responsive,**
**Annotation:** **Heaven does not speak**, yet **all things move in response to the seasons.**

**Explanation:** **"Heaven speaks not—how could it speak?"** Yet **rewarding virtue and punishing licentiousness**, there is **no deviation**, hence **"naturally responsive."**

**Commentary:** **The retribution of fortune and calamity** is **like echoes and shadows**—**without words, yet good and evil must respond.**

**Not summoned yet coming of its own accord,**
**Annotation:** **Heaven does not call forth the myriad things**, yet **all bear yin and turn toward yang.**

**Explanation:** **"The Dao/Way of Heaven does not summon the myriad things to obey It**, yet **things cannot defy it**—they come **naturally in accordance with Heaven’s command."**

**Commentary:** **The retribution of good and evil** follows **one’s deeds**—**without summons, it must come of its own accord.**

**Serene yet cunning in its planning.**
**Annotation:** **"Serene"** means **vast and expansive**; though **Heaven’s Dao is vast and broad**, it **calculates human affairs**, **cultivating virtue or punishing vice**, and **each receives its due.**

**Commentary:** **"Planning"** means **reckoning**. **Speaking of the hidden principles**—**without labored explanation**, yet **virtue and vice are calculated with precision, not a hair’s breadth amiss.**

**Heaven’s net is vast and wide,**
**sparse yet never failing.**
**Annotation:** **Heaven’s net**—**vast and boundless**, though **sparse and distant**, yet **in overseeing human virtue and vice**, **nothing is missed.**

**Commentary:** **"Vast"** means **broad and expansive**. **"Net"** is **law and decree**. **Saying that Heaven’s natural net** is **vast and distant**, yet **deeds great or small, merit or fault**, **reward and retribution are without error.**

**Sun’s Commentary:** **What is called "naturally responsive"**—**Heaven’s Dao does not speak, yet responds naturally.**
**Understanding "naturally responsive"**—**it lies not in much speech.**

**Lu’s Commentary:** **Silent and empty**, hence **"not speaking"**—**yet when moved, it responds**, hence **"naturally responsive."**

**People do not commonly fear death,**
**Annotation:** **Rulers impose harsh punishments**, and the people **cannot endure life**, hence **they do not fear death.**

**Those who govern themselves**—**indulging desires harms the spirit**, **greed for wealth destroys the body**, yet **the people do not know to fear.**

**How can one use death to frighten them?**
**Annotation:** **If the ruler does not mitigate punishments** and **teach people to abandon their desires**, how can one **establish laws** and **frighten them with death?**

**Commentary:** **This condemns the deep delusion of common sentiment**—**chasing worldly attachments**, **unafraid of life and death**, though **precepts and warnings are clear**, yet **there is no terror**—hence the **sigh of "how can one?"**, expressing **deep pity.**

**Explanatory Resolution:** **Saying that people do not seek life’s pleasures in desires**, **hearing virtue yet not practicing it**, **knowing vice yet not abandoning it**—**how can they recognize benefit?**

**If the people were to constantly fear death,**
**Annotation:** **One must first eliminate what harms them**, then **teach people to abandon their greedy desires.**

**and those who act strangely, I would seize and kill them—who would dare?**

**Annotation:** **If one governs by the Dao**, yet the people **do not comply**, instead **acting deceitfully and falsely**, then **according to the king’s law**, one **seizes and kills them**—who would dare to transgress?

**Laozi laments that rulers do not first govern by virtue and the Dao**, but **instead impose punishments.**

**Explanation:** **If all people followed pure transformation**, **not daring to indulge desires**, **constantly fearing death**, yet **only those who act strangely**—**even if I could seize and kill such deceitful ones**, who would dare to do so?

**Commentary:** **The heart of greed and desire** **daily breeds deceit**, **firmly clinging to delusion**, thus **making it habitual**—**the underworld’s officers capture them**, **seize and kill them**, **with sharp blades and tortures**, **evidence clear and verified**—if there are **those with insight and awareness**, who would **still commit crimes?**

**There are always those who kill in place of the executioner.**
**Annotation:** **The executioner**—**Heaven, high above and overseeing from afar**, **inspects human transgressions**; **Heaven’s net is vast and wide, sparse yet never failing**—this is so.

**Explanation:** **Such deceitful ones**—**Heaven’s net does not fail them**, hence **there are always Heaven’s executioners who kill them.**

**Explanatory Resolution:** **Referring to the mouth**—**to its left is the "Executioner of Yin"**, to its right the **"Executioner of Killing."** If one **commits yin transgressions**, the **Executioner of Yin reports to the Highest**, **examining the soul and spirit**; if one **speaks evil**, the **Executioner of Killing reports to the Lord of Life**, who **records it**, and **when guilt is full, death follows.**

**Commentary:** **This penal net has its own overseers**—the **Three Officials and Nine Departments**, the **One Hundred and Twenty Bureaus**, the **Northern Capital’s prisons and the Underworld’s offices**, the **Eight Hardships and Five Torments**, each with its **designated officers.**

**Those who act as executioners in place of Heaven**—
**this is called substituting for the Great Carpenter in felling wood.**
**Annotation:** **Heaven’s Dao is supremely clear**, its **oversight is constant**—**like spring growth, summer flourishing, autumn harvest, winter storage**, the **celestial stem’s rotation**—**governing all in sequence**. If a ruler **attempts to usurp killing**, it is **like a clumsy man substituting for the Great Carpenter in felling wood**—**laborious yet ineffective.**

**Commentary on "Restraining and Severing" (節解) says:**
The **Dao/Way of Heaven** rewards the virtuous and punishes the wicked, **governing the body of the people**—
**like the Great Carpenter crafting vessels, the virtuous are perfected, the wicked are ruined.**

**Those who substitute for the Great Carpenter in hewing wood**—
**how few escape unharmed by their hands!**
**Annotation:** When a ruler **enacts punishments**, it is **like a clumsy man substituting for the Great Carpenter in hewing wood**—
**his measurements and angles are flawed, and he harms himself in the process.**
**Those who substitute for Heaven in killing**—
**they lose the **proper order and principles** (紀綱), and if they lose these, they **suffer retribution in return.**

**Commentary on "Restraint" (御) says:**
When a ruler **assigns punishments**, substituting for the **officers of execution**—
**how could it be that he alone spares the people, but also that he himself loses Heaven’s harmony?**

**Commentary (疏):**
All living beings **create karma** (造業), each reaping their own **fruits of retribution** (報).
**Punishments and suffering** (刑罚苦楚) have their own **underworld overseers** (冥司).
**The unenlightened** (無識), **arrogant and self-serving** (師心專辄), who **presume to substitute for the Underworld’s officers** (冥司) in **inflicting slaughter** (行誅戮)—
**what difference is there from a mediocre, clumsy artisan wielding an axe?**
**The clumsy artisan wielding an axe**—
**this is not his craft, and he not only fails in his work but also harms his own hands.**
**To forcibly substitute for the officers of execution**—
**its meaning is the same; not only does he abuse his authority (滥職), but he also invites disaster (獲其衅) upon himself.**

**Commentary on "Restraining and Severing" (節解) says:**
**Human governance** (人治) over the body varies in effectiveness—
**like artisans shaping vessels, some are skilled, some are clumsy.**
**The skilled bring the vessel to perfection; the clumsy harm themselves in the process.**

**The people’s hunger**—
**it arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation.**
**Annotation:** The people’s **suffering from hunger and cold**—
**it stems from their rulers above consuming too much while taxing them heavily.**
**Commentary (疏):**
**Hunger** (饥) refers to **lacking inner moral cultivation** (內無道德).
**Above** (上) means **the heart** (心), for the heart is the master of the **five viscera and all actions** (五藏百行).
**Taxation** (税) means **excessive accumulation**; **consumption** (食) means **indulgence in sensory pleasures** (滋味).
**The reason people fail to cultivate virtue**—
**their hearts are entangled by external desires, and they greedily indulge in sensory pleasures.**

**Commentary on "Restraining and Severing" (節解) says:**
**Hunger** (饥) refers to **insufficient qi** (氣不足).
**The qi is insufficient** because of **excessive craving for fine flavors** (坐口嗜美味).
**Excessive consumption** (食多) means **hoarding wealth** (實畜積), which leads to **obstruction** (僻).
**Thus, defenses are erected in all directions.**
**This is why there is hunger.**
**Annotation:** This is why the people **all regard their rulers as greedy** (化上為貪),
**rebelling against the Dao/Way and defying virtue** (叛道違德), and so **suffer hunger.**

**Commentary (疏):**
**This ties together the previous reasoning.**
**The people are difficult to govern**—
**it is because their rulers are overbearing** (有為).
**Annotation:** The people are **untreatable**—
**because their rulers above have excessive desires and love to interfere** (多欲，好有為).
**Commentary (疏):**
**The reason all actions become chaotic and difficult to manage**—
**is solely because their hearts crave interference** (贪有為).
**If the heart does not interfere**, then all actions are easily governed.
**Thus it is known: "Ten thousand phenomena arise from the single mind."**
**This is why they are difficult to govern.**
**Annotation:** This is why their people **regard their rulers as interfering and deceitful** (化上有為),
**making governance all the more arduous and unmanageable.**

「○**Jiéjiě** says: The common people are called **"one hundred pulses"** (百脉), the reason their **vitality fluctuates without harmony** (盈缩不和平)—
**it is because their mouths do not uphold the single principle** (口不含一), their lips are parched, and their **bodily fluids are exhausted** (液竭), thus their **pulses lose their vital essence** (脉失精泄).

**People’s disregard for death**—
**it is because their pursuit of life is excessive** (求生之厚).
**Annotation:** The reason **people lightly court death**—
**is that their obsession with living is too profound** (求活之事太厚), **valuing profit at the expense of their own peril** (贵利以自危).
**Commentary (疏):** Those who **do not complete their natural lifespan** (不终天年) and **lightly enter death’s domain** (轻入死地) are **bewildered by the Dao, inverted in their understanding** (迷顺颠倒), unable to **awaken to true insight** (悟达). They **do not realize that all things—self and world—are illusory** (物我俱幻), that **birth and death are simultaneous** (即生即死). **Life is marked by excessive craving** (生既多贪), and the **six senses** (六尘) amass **abundant karmic resources** (厚资) from the **four great elements** (四大), thus hastening their demise.
**Jiéjiě says:** This refers to **those who do not dread death’s approach**—
**it is because they indulge their physical form excessively** (养形太厚), **gratifying their mouth and appetite** (恣其口腹), **losing the Dao of life** (失其生道), hence their death.
**Thus it is known: "People’s disregard for death"**—
**because their pursuit of life is too excessive** (求生太厚), **they lightly court death’s domain** (故轻入死地).

**Now, only those who do not cling to life** (无以生为者) **are truly virtuous in honoring life** (贤於贵生).
**Annotation:** Only those who **do not make life their primary concern** (无以生为务者) are virtuous—
**when titles and emoluments do not sway their intentions** (爵禄不干於意), and **wealth and gain do not enter their hearts** (财利不入於心), then **even the Son of Heaven cannot command them as subjects** (天子不得臣), nor **nobles as companions** (诸侯不得友). **Thus they are truly virtuous in honoring life.**
**Commentary (疏):** *Virtue* (贤) means **excellence in harmony** (善也). The **mystic sages** (玄悟之士) **do not cling to form or emptiness** (非色灭空), nor **lie idle in forgetfulness** (咯焉坐忘). Instead, they **transcend the notion of life itself** (生无生相), **rejecting the clamor of worldly desires** (膻躁荣利) and **spurning the corruption of mortal affairs** (厌秽风尘). Therefore, **only those who do not cling to life** (独不以生为者) **can truly safeguard and honor those who do.**

**Jiéjiě says:** This refers to **those who can mourn life before it is lost** (忧生於未生) and **guard form before it decays** (忧形於未形)—
**only by contemplating non-action** (但念无为) and **abandoning artificiality** (舍自然) do they **attain true virtue and honor the Dao** (为贤贵道), **securing their own life** (安其生).

**Now, the nature of human life is soft and frail** (人之生也柔弱).
**Annotation:** When **humans are born, they are infused with harmonious qi** (含和气) and **embrace vital spirit** (抱精神), thus soft and frail.
**Their death, however, is rigid and unyielding** (其死也坚强).
**Annotation:** When **humans die, their harmonious qi is exhausted** (和气竭), and their **vital spirit departs** (精神亡), thus rigid and unyielding.

**All things—grasses and trees—are soft and brittle when they live** (万物草木之生也柔脆).
**Annotation:** When **harmonious qi remains** (和气存也).
**Their death, however, is withered and decayed** (其死也枯槁).
**Annotation:** When **harmonious qi departs** (和气去也).
**Commentary (疏):** When **life persists with its mandate** (生存有命), then **all limbs are soft and frail** (诸节柔弱). But **at death**, **bone and flesh become rigid and unyielding** (骨肉坚强).
**Grasses and trees** are likewise—
**when alive, they are pliable and tender** (生时软脆), but **when dead, their branches and trunks wither** (条柯枯槁). **This softness in life** (生而柔软者) **is because harmonious qi remains** (和气存也). **This rigidity in death** (死而坚强者) **is because harmonious qi departs** (和气离也).
**This analogy serves to illustrate** (举此有识为辩) **the superiority and inferiority of things** (其胜劣者也).
**Now, rigidity and unyielding are the marks of death** (夫坚强者死之徒), while **softness and frailty are the marks of life** (柔弱者生之徒).
**Annotation:** Observing the **two precedents above**, it is clear—
**rigidity and unyielding belong to death** (坚强者死), while **softness and frailty belong to life** (柔弱者生).
**Commentary (疏):** *Tú* (徒) means **kindred or category** (类也). Thus, **those who act rigidly and forcefully** (行刚强者) **contradict the harmonious principle** (乖於和理), **and so align themselves with death** (故与死为徒). **Those who act softly and frailly** (行柔弱者) **conform to harmonious qi** (顺於和气), **and so align themselves with life** (故与生为徒).
**This is a unified metaphor.**

**Thus, strong armies do not prevail** (是以兵强则不胜).
**Annotation:** Even **mighty armies** (强大之兵), **reckless in battle and delighting in slaughter** (轻战乐杀), **with poisonous flows and lingering grudges** (毒流怨结), **are ultimately undone when many weak stand as one** (众弱为一), **for their strength is their own undoing** (强故不胜).
**Jiéjiě says:** *Army* (兵) here refers to **the mouth** (口)—
**when the mouth is strong, it is exhausted by others** (口强为人所穷), and **when the yin is strong, it is overpowered by the female** (阴强为女所侵).
**The Master responds:** *The softness of life* (生之柔弱) **is the fullness of harmonious qi** (和气全也). *The rigidity of death* (死之坚强) **is the dissipation of harmonious qi** (和气散也).
**To clarify, guarding softness and frailty preserves life and extends years** (守柔弱者全生保年), while **acting rigidly and forcefully destroys the body and forfeits life** (为强梁者亡身失生).

**When trees are rigid and strong, their branches and leaves are crushed** (木强则共).
**Annotation:** When **trees are strong and robust** (木强大), their **branches and leaves are pressed beneath** (枝叶共生其上).
**Commentary (疏):** *Army* (兵) here refers to **the three activities and six senses** (三业六根). **Those who indulge their passions** (纵恣六情), **forcefully dominate their surroundings** (强暴前境), and **consume without restraint** (食取无厌) **will inevitably suffer grave calamity and misfortune** (必遭重殃大祸), hence their defeat.
**It is like a sturdy tree** (譬树木粗强), whose **branches are crushed beneath its own weight** (故枝条共压其上), or **like a grand beam** (亦犹梁栋宏壮), whose **rafters and tiles press down upon it** (故椽瓦压其上).
**The strong are pressed low, while the weak rise high** (强大处下，柔弱处上).
**Annotation:** When **constructing things or achieving feats**, **great trees are placed below** (大木处下), and **smaller things above** (小物处上). **This is the Dao of Heaven—suppressing the strong and elevating the weak** (天道抑强扶弱), **the natural order’s effect** (自然之效).
**Jiéjiě says:** This refers to **the hair’s softness and frailty** (发以柔弱), **which is worn down by others** (为人所戴), and **the bones’ rigidity and strength** (体骨坚强), **which are labored upon by others** (为人所劳).
**Commentary (疏):** The **rigid and strong trees dwell below** (坚强之木居下), while **the soft and weak branches ascend above** (柔弱之条处上). Thus, **the rigid and strong are consigned to the Nine Abysses below** (居九幽之下), and **the soft and weak are elevated to the Three Pure Ones above** (处三清之上).

**Now, the Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow** (天之道，其犹张弓乎？).
**Annotation:** The **Dao of Heaven is profound and distant** (天道杳邈), and **analogies are used to elucidate it** (举物类以为喻).
**The Master responds:** The **Dao of Heaven is mysterious and far-reaching** (天道玄远), and **cannot be made clear without metaphor** (非喻不明), hence the **bow analogy to reveal its function** (举张弓以彰其用).
**The high are pressed low, the low are lifted up** (高者抑之，下者举之), **the overabundant are diminished** (有余者损之), **and the insufficient are supplemented** (不足者与之).
**Annotation:** This describes **the harmonious adjustment of drawing a bow** (言张弓和调之义如是), **only then can it be used.**
**The Dao of Heaven presses the high and lifts the low** (天抑高举下), **diminishes the strong and supplements the weak** (损强益弱), **thus the Dao of Heaven** (天之道).
**Commentary (疏):** To **lift the low and press the high** (举下使高，抑高令下), **both must be balanced** (高下调适), **only then can the arrow be released** (方可运箭). **The proud and arrogant, with excess** (傲慢有余者), **will inevitably meet ruin and defeat** (必招损败). **Those in harmony but lacking** (和不足者), **are granted fortune and goodness** (与其福善). **Thus the Dao of Heaven** (天道如是), **and it is likened to drawing a bow** (故似张弓).

**The Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency** (天之道，损有余补不足).
**Annotation:** The **Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements the humble** (损有余而益谦), **for it always values moderation and harmony as supreme** (言天道常以中和为上).
**Commentary (疏):** *Bestowing fortune upon the virtuous and calamity upon the licentious* (福善祸淫) is the **natural principle** (自然之理), **as previously expounded** (仍前生后). **This passage restates the same meaning.**

**Now, human conduct is not so** (人之道则不然).
**Annotation:** Human **conduct opposes the Dao of Heaven** (人道与天道反).
**They diminish the deficient to enrich the excessive** (损不足，奉有余).
**Annotation:** **Worldly folk diminish the poor to enrich the rich** (损贫以奉富), **plunder the weak to empower the strong** (夺弱以益强).
**The Master responds:** The **Dao of Heaven applies evenhanded measures** (天道平施), **distributing surplus to the lacking** (裒多益寡), but **humans pervert Heaven’s ways** (人则违天), **flipping the principle of diminishing the deficient** (翻损不足者).
**Commentary (疏):** In **human affairs**, **worldly conduct favors superficiality and deception** (好行浮伪), **pursuing trends and competing for gain** (趋势竞利). **This defies Heaven and contradicts nature** (违天背理), **plundering the deficient poor and lowly** (割损贫贱之不足) to **supply the excessive rich and noble** (供奉富贵之有余).

「Who can have surplus to bestow upon the world, only those who embody the Dao. **Annotation:** It asks, who can occupy a position of surplus and, out of self-restraint, bestow upon the world’s deficient? Only a ruler who embodies the Dao can enact this.

The **Master responds:** The **Dao of Heaven** is evenhanded, yet the **virtue/power of the sage** does not accumulate. **Annotation:** The sage’s virtue/power is bestowed as benevolence, yet he does not rely upon or expect repayment. When his deeds are complete, he does not dwell in their fruits. **Annotation:** When his achievements are fulfilled, he does not claim their rewards.

**Annotation:** The sage, by pushing his virtue/power outward and not dwelling in its results, does not wish to display his wisdom. **Annotation:** The sage’s reason for pushing his virtue/power outward and not dwelling in its results is to prevent others from recognizing his own wisdom.

**Annotation:** The sage who embodies the Dao often rescues the world, yet though he bestows both wealth and virtue, he does not rely upon his own efforts. Even with great achievements, he does not dwell in their rewards, for his intent lies in humbly withdrawing himself, pushing virtue/power outward, concealing his brilliance and obscuring his traces, not wishing to display his own wisdom and ability.

Among all things in the world, none are as soft and weak as water, **Annotation:** Water is soft and weak—when contained, it is round; when shaped, it is square. If dammed, it stops; if released, it flows.

**Annotation:** All things in the world differ in their nature, yet none are as soft and weak as water. By this, it illustrates the Dao’s gentle and yielding nature, its adaptability and capacity to nurture all things, like water permeating and nourishing everything.

Yet when it comes to overcoming hardness and strength, none can surpass it, **Annotation:** Water can erode mountains and topple ridges; it can wear down iron and dissolve bronze. Nothing can overcome water and achieve success.

**Annotation:** Though water is soft and weak, its utility is boundless. It attacks and overcomes hardness and strength—none are more effective than it. This is because the Dao breaks through obstacles without force; its meaning is likewise.

**Annotation:** Water is the inner essence, that is, the saliva in one’s mouth. When one rinses and swallows it, it can attack evil and dispel malice, penetrating to the marrow. Like the *qū bò* (麴蘗) that dissolves rice and medicinal herbs, nothing can surpass its efficacy.

**Annotation:** In overcoming hardness and strength, nothing can replace water. **Annotation:** There is no substitute for water in overcoming hardness and strength.」

The Sovereign replied: *"To attack strength with hardness, both hardnesses are damaged; to govern strength with softness, the strong are damaged while the soft remain intact. Thus, in overcoming hardness and strength, nothing can replace water."*

**Annotation:** It is said that water can attack hardness—an unaltered principle across all ages. The Way of non-action overcoming existence is an unchanging art through the ages.

Thus, softness overcomes hardness, and weakness overcomes strength.
**Annotation:** Water can extinguish fire; yin can consume yang.
The tongue is soft, the teeth are hard—yet the teeth perish before the tongue.
None in the world understand this,
**Annotation:** Knowing that softness and weakness endure, while hardness and strength are broken.
None can act accordingly.
**Annotation:** They shame humility and modesty, yet crave force and arrogance.

**Annotation:** This refers to how a person, by containing essence and drinking qi, governs the blood and vital forces—common practice yet unrecognized by the masses.

**Annotation:** Since water can attack metal and stone, it is known that softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength—a truth understood by both wise and foolish alike, yet no one in the world follows it.

Thus, the Sage says:
**Annotation:** Referring to serving those below.

Bearing the filth of the realm—this is called the steward of the ancestral altars.
**Annotation:** A ruler who endures the impurities of the realm, like the sea that does not reject the tides, can long preserve the ancestral altars and become the sovereign of the land.
**Annotation (御):** Drawing in the faults of all under heaven—this is bearing the realm’s filth. Calling oneself "lonely and bereft" (孤寡) and "not the grain" (不谷)—this is bearing the realm’s misfortunes. With such virtue, the ancestral altars are served, and thus all under heaven turn to him.

**Annotation (疏):** *Guó* (国) refers to the domain of the state; *gòu* (垢) means disgrace. Those who embody the Dao in the world, humble and yielding, accommodating and compliant, enduring personal humiliation without contending with others, are fit to be stewards of the ancestral altars and shepherd the people.

**Annotation (节解):** The human form’s left spirit (*arcan*) is the ancestral altar (*shè*), the right spirit (*pò*) is the grain altar (*jì*). Governing the vital breath (*yī qì*) makes one the sovereign.

To bear the realm’s misfortunes—this is called the King of all under heaven.
**Annotation:** A ruler who takes upon himself the people’s faults and endures the calamities of misfortune can reign over all under heaven.
**Annotation (节解):** The realm (*guó*) refers to the body. When breath enters the spleen, transforming dregs into essence and renewing the old with the new, nourishing the Five Spirits, it reigns over the viscera.

**Annotation (疏):** *Bùxiáng* (不祥) means "not good." The Sage’s discernment is vast and penetrating, knowing good and evil. If misfortune arises, he blames himself and takes the fault upon himself—this is worthy of ruling all under heaven. In ancient times, when King Tang said, *"I cut down a thousand li to come,"* this was his deed.

Earlier, it was said that the ancestral altars could be entrusted to the feudal lords; now it is said that all under heaven should belong to the Son of Heaven. This is upright speech, though the world may take it as paradox.

---

**Annotation (节解):** The Way speaks of what common folk desire—purity and cleanliness as supreme, fragrance and beauty as highest—yet the Dao takes receiving filth as its master, dwelling in the low to rule. This is said to be contrary to the world.

**Annotation (御):** Though the words appear contrary to common custom, why? The world loves beauty and honor, yet now it is said to receive filth and misfortune—thus it seems contrary. But *"if"* (若) is used to clarify that what is contrary is not fixed opposition: though it seems contrary, it is always in harmony with the Way. Though it appears contrary, it remains true, conforming to the world’s nature while transcending it. Though it seems contrary, it is not truly contrary—this is why *"if"* is added.

Earlier, it was said that the **Way’s virtue** is profound and far-reaching, contrary to things, and then it attains great harmony—this is its meaning.

To reconcile great grievances,
**Annotation (御):** *"To reconcile"* (和) means to harmonize. The greatest grievance against oneself is **emotional desire** (情欲). The ruler seeks to guide the people through speech, harmonizing their desires so that none remain—thus it is said, *"To reconcile great grievances."*

There must be lingering grievances.
**Annotation (御):** When laws are established, traces of governance remain, and these traces become grievances that affect the common people.
**Annotation (疏):** Grievances are **discriminative perceptions** (慧). They are all **dharma** that awaits opposition—whether of existence or non-existence. Though one may discard the extremes of existence and non-existence, attain neither existence nor non-existence, and harmonize the two edges into the **middle path** (中一), one still clings to **emptiness** (玄), failing to penetrate its true essence. Though this is **non-attachment** (无待), it cannot fully escape **attachment** (不待). This is **selective attachment** (待独), not yet **absolute freedom** (独独)—thus lingering oppositions persist.

How can this be considered good?
**Annotation (御):** If lingering grievances remain, it cannot be considered good.
**Annotation (疏):** *"How"* (安) means *"why."* Though one may discard the two extremes, one still clings to the middle—why can it not be fully good?

**Annotation (节解):** This refers to the mouth. When one sings, there must be response. If people practice the Dao, the Dao will come to meet them. When one sings of goodness, the good will respond in harmony—then there will be no lingering grievances. But people of today indulge in **evil thoughts** (邪想). Evil thoughts follow them, and they call upon **evil spirits** (邪鬼). The spirits come to respond, and when one sings of evil, the evil harmonizes—how can such a thing be considered good?

Thus, the Sage holds the **left契** (left契),
**Annotation (御):** The left契 is the **heart** (心). The heart is the **yang viscera** (阳藏), binding with the present realm (境) to establish trust—thus it is called the left契. The Sage knows that establishing guidance will inevitably leave traces, and traces will breed lingering grievances. Therefore, he upholds this heart, making it pure and tranquil, and transforms the people below, so that they have no desires. Without need for punishment or blame, the heart naturally aligns with **non-action** (无为).

**Annotation (疏):** 契 is **trust** (信) and **harmony** (合). Left is **yang** (阳). The Sage’s heart, dwelling in **Dao/Way**, resonates with **wisdom** (智), in perfect accord. Through this, he can make all things harmonize, transcending the myriad faults. Thus, he attains the meaning of **longevity and eternal vision** (久视长生).

To hold the left契 is to not hold yet hold. Like an emperor grasping the left契, by which he governs all affairs, the Sage holds the **perfect契** within the cycle, thus able to guide the myriad multitudes. And when it is said that he does not blame, though he may guide all beings, he forgets their faults. The people are like **sacrificial dogs** (刍狗), and he does not blame them for their shortcomings.

**Annotation (节解):** The left契 is **yang virtue** (阳德). The Sage does not reconcile great grievances but only cultivates his own virtue, never blaming others for their faults. Thus, the virtuous ruler governs through **trust and harmony** (司契), while the unvirtuous ruler governs through **traces and laws** (司彻).
**Annotation (疏):** 司 means **to govern** (主), and 彻 means **traces** (迹). The Sage’s perfect契 does not cling to discriminative words. The unvirtuous ruler, however, remains stuck in the **nets of governance** (筌蹄), unable to fully transcend them. Since traces are not erased, it is said that he governs through **traces** (司彻).

**Annotation (节解):** This refers to people practicing **moral cultivation** (行道德). The **Heavenly Command** (司命) bestows their **fate** (算). If people practice evil, the Command will **kill and destroy their records** (同杀彻其籍)—this is its meaning.

The **Heavenly Dao** has no favorites, always aligning with the good.
**Annotation (疏):** The **natural principle** (天真) of the Dao knows no favoritism. Those of **highest virtue** (上善) naturally harmonize with it—just as before, the Sage held the left契 without blaming others.

**Small realms, few people** (小国寡民).
**Annotation (御):** Though the Sage may govern great realms, he still regards them as small, teaching **frugality** (俭约) and avoiding **extravagance** (奢泰). Though the people are many, they are treated as if few, not daring to burden or exploit them.

**Annotation (疏):** Realm (国) is **domain** (域). The heart dwells in **emptiness** (空)—thus it is said *"small realm."* This is the practice of **Hinayana** (小乘) and **few desires** (寡欲). Instruments (器) are the **weapons of the hundred** (什恶兵器). Though the six **roots** (根) exist, their use is **unexhausted** (不穷). When it is said *"the hundred and the ten"* (什伯), it refers to the greater numbers. *"Not using"* (不用) means **resting the roots** (息诸根), not staining them with the dust of the world.

**Annotation (御):** 什 is **the five** (伍), and 伯 is **the great** (长). This chapter clarifies that people are **naturally harmonious** (含淳和), without seeking or demanding. When there are those whose talents and capacities fit to be **leaders of the five or the ten** (什伍伯长), they are still not **used** (用).

「○**Jiéjiě** says: *"Small realm"* (小国) refers to the **body** (形), *"the hundred and the ten"* (什伯) refers to the **Five Zang Organs** (五藏).
The heart and kidneys are *"the five"* (什), the liver and lungs are *"the great"* (伯).
When one **closes the mouth and cultivates the breath** (闭口行气), then the *"hundred and the ten"* (什伯) **qi** flourishes without **unnecessary use** (无不用).

To make the people **cherish death** (重死)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** If a ruler can **benefit the people and remove their harm** (兴利除害), allowing each to **find their rightful place** (得其所), then the people will **cherish death and hold life dear** (重死而贵生).
And **not relocate far** (不远徙)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** If governance is **not burdensome** (不烦), then the people will **settle contentedly in their occupations** (各安其业).
Thus, they **do not move far** (不远迁徙), leaving their **usual dwellings** (常处).

○**Yù** says: With **few thoughts and few desires** (少思寡欲), they **do not lightly expend their life** (不轻用其生), **devoting themselves to the root** (敦本) without **seeking anything** (无求), so they **do not relocate far** (故不远迁徙).

○**Cù** says: All **actions** (诸行) are **heavy with stillness** (重静), **knowing contentment and abiding by their allotment** (守分), so they **attain their natural lifespan** (得终其天年) and **do not depart from their present realm** (不远遂前境).

Though there are **vessels and conveyances** (舟舆), they **do not ride them** (无所乘之)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** In **purity and non-action** (清净无为), they **do not indulge in elaborate luxuries** (不作繁华) and **do not enjoy travel and recreation** (不好出入游娱).

○**Cù** says: *"Vessels and conveyances"* (舟舆) refer to the **Three Yanas** (三乘教法).
The **boat** (舟) relies on **water** (水) to **ferry across** (济渡)—
This illustrates that **teachings** (教) are like a **boat navigating all beings** (舟航万物), **crossing the ocean of birth and death** (度於生死海).
Thus, the *Xīshēng Jīng* (《西升经》) states:
*"Long abandoned the sea of birth and death"* (久旷生死海),
*"Cutting off the flow of greed and love"* (隔绝贪爱流).
The **carriage** (舆) moves on **land** (陆) with **wheels** (轮转)—
This illustrates that **teachings** (教) can **transform the ordinary into the sacred** (转凡成圣), **achieving insight beyond words** (得理忘言).
Thus, they **dispense with teachings and do not rely on them** (能遣教而不用).

Though there are **armor and weapons** (甲兵), they **do not deploy them** (无所陈之)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** They **harbor no resentment toward the world** (无怨恶於天下).

○**Cù** says: Though one possesses **bodily and mental armor and weapons** (身心兵甲),
In the state of **"sitting and forgetting"** (车体坐忘),
With **external phenomena emptied** (物境既空),
What need is there for **utterance or exposition** (陈说)?
This sentence **reverses and clarifies** the earlier *"the hundred and the ten"* (什伯) **instruments unused** (之器而不用).

To make the people **return to knotting cords** (复结绳) and **employ them** (而用之)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** To **abandon culture and return to simplicity** (弃文反质), **keeping faith without deceit** (信不欺).

○**Yù** says: *"Vessels and conveyances"* (舟舆) are meant for **relocation** (利迁徙),
*"Armor and weapons"* (甲兵) are meant for **waging war** (徇攻战).
Since both are **unwanted** (无欲),
They **do not ride or deploy them** (故无所乘陈).
Returning to **primordial simplicity** (反朴还淳),
They **revert to the use of the Three Sovereigns** (归於三皇结绳之用).

○**Jiéjiě** says: This means that **Dao/Way-qi** (道气) **naturally flows and functions** (自流行),
As **bodily use** (形中之用),
Like the **trustworthiness of knotted cords** (结绳之信).

○**Cù** says: Having **emptied the heart and verified the principle** (虚心证理),
**Discarding teachings and forgetting the raft** (舍教忘筌),
They **resort to knotted cords** (寄结绳),
**Showing their return to the origin** (示其反本).
This sentence **repeats the earlier theme** of *"though there are vessels and conveyances, they do not ride them"* (虽有舟舆无所乘).

**Simple food** (甘其食)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** To **enjoy simple nourishment** (甘其蔬养), **not plundering the people** (不渔食百姓).

○**Cù** says: **Taste is the Dao/Way** (味至道).
**Beautiful attire** (美其服)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** To **adorn simple garments** (美其恶衣), **not valuing the five colors** (不贵五色).

○**Cù** says: **Virtue/power shines through the body** (德莹身).
○**Jiéjiě** says: This means to **find sweetness in the qi of food** (甘食其气),
And **beauty in the Dao/Way of attire** (美服其道).

**Peaceful dwelling** (安其居)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** To **settle in humble thatched homes** (安其茅茨之居),
**Not favoring ornate dwellings** (不好文饰之屋).

○**Cù** says: **All places are peaceful** (所在皆安), **stillness in motion** (动而寂).

**To delight in their customs** (乐其俗)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** To **rejoice in simplicity and authenticity** (乐其质朴之俗),
**Not altering them** (不转移).

○**Cù** says: **Harmonizing with the world** (和光人世),
**Stillness in motion** (寂而动).

○**Jiéjiě** says: This means to **settle the body and delight the spirit** (安形乐神),
**Singing while embracing the belly** (抱腹而歌吟).

**Neighboring realms are visible** (邻国相望), **the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard** (鸡狗之声相闻)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** They are **nearby** (相去近).

○**Cù** says: The **chicken** (鸡) **marks the dawn** (司晨),
The **dog** (狗) **wards off night** (警夜)—
This illustrates that **all teachings** (一切言教)
**Alert to the long night of ignorance** (警长昏之夜),
**Awaken the dawn of wisdom** (思智慧之晨).
This **teaching** (言教) **is close to realizing the One Mind** (近证一心),
Thus it is said that their **sounds are heard** (故言相闻).

**The people do not interact until old age** (民至老不相往来)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** They **lack emotional attachments** (其无情欲).

○**Jiéjiě** says: *"Neighboring realms"* (邻国) are the **two ears** (两耳).
The **two ears** (两耳) **face each other** (相望),
**Preserving their tranquility** (保其安).
They **guard their spirit-qi** (使神气各有所守),
**Not interfering with one another** (不来往相干),
Thus **even in old age, they remain keen** (故至老常能聪明).

○**Cù** says: **Uniting with principle and embodying truth** (会理体真),
**The common is the Dao/Way, the Dao/Way is common** (即俗即道),
**Not coming from the realm of birth and death** (不从生死而来),
Nor **going toward any realm of the Dao/Way** (亦无道境可往).
With **the two domains as one** (二域既一),
They **do not interact** (故不相往来),
And **the two boundaries are without boundary** (二际无际).

**True words are not ornate** (信言不美)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** *"True words"* (信言) are **honest speech** (实言).
*"Not ornate"* (不美) means **simple and unadorned** (朴且质).

○**Yù** says: *"True words"* (信言) are **sacred teachings** (圣教).
**Honest and true words** (信实之言),
**Do not exceed the common** (不出於俗),
Thus they are **not ornate** (故不美).

**Ornate words are not true** (美言不信)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** *"Ornate words"* (美言) are **embellished speech** (滋美之华辞).
*"Not true"* (不信) means **decorative and full of emptiness** (饰伪多空虚).

○**Yù** says: *"Ornate words"* (美言) are **worldly teachings** (世教).
**Sweet and beautiful words** (甘美之言),
**Align with the common** (动合於俗),
Thus they are **not true** (故不信).

○**Cù** says: **Truth** (信) is **reality** (实).
**Ornate** (美) is **superficial and gaudy** (浮艳).
Those of **highest virtue/power** (上德之人),
**Dwelling in true emptiness** (冥真契道),
Their **uttered teachings** (所说言教)
Are **real without embellishment** (实而不华).
**Superficial and gaudy words** (浮艳之言),
Are **novels of the common world** (俗中小说),
**Contradicting ultimate principle** (既乖至理),
Thus they are **not trusted** (所以不信).
Hence, **Zhuangzi** says:
*"A dog does not bark well for being good, nor does a man speak well for being virtuous"* (犬不以善吠为良，人不以善言为贤).

○**Jiéjiě** says: This means that **those who trust in Dao/Way-speech** (信道言者),
**Do not adorn it with worldly matters** (则不美於俗事),
And **those who adorn worldly matters** (美俗事者),
**Do not trust in Dao/Way-speech** (则不信於道言).

**The wise do not seek extensive knowledge** (知者不博)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** *"The wise"* (知者) refer to **those who understand the Dao/Way** (知道之士).
*"Not extensive"* (不博) means **abiding in the One** (守一元).

**The extensive do not understand** (博者不知)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** *"The extensive"* (博者) refers to **those with many experiences** (多见闻).
*"Do not understand"* (不知) means **losing the true essence** (失真要).

○**Yù** says: *"The wise"* (知者) are **those who have awakened insight** (了悟).
*"The extensive"* (博者) are **those with much hearing** (多闻).

○**Cù** says: Those who **understand the Dao/Way** (知道之人),
**Forget words and abandon learning** (忘言绝学),
Thus they **do not seek extensive knowledge** (所以不博).
**Scholars of broad learning** (博学之士),
**Are ensnared by names and teachings** (耽滞名教),
Thus they **do not understand** (所以不知).
Hence, the *Xīshēng Jīng* (《西升经》) states:
*"Worldly people only know of heaven and earth, the myriad things,
But do not know their own source of birth"* (世人徒知有天地万物，不知己之所由生),
This is **great ignorance** (是大不知).
Again it states:
*"If you know the One, all matters are complete"* (子能知一，万事毕).
**Zhuangzi** says:
*"Culture extinguishes substance, extensive knowledge drowns the heart"* (文灭质，博溺心).

**The good do not argue** (善者不辩)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** *"The good"* (善者) **cultivate themselves with the Dao/Way** (以道修身),
*"Do not argue"* (不辩) means **not adorned with rhetoric** (不文彩).

**The argumentative are not good** (辩者不善)—
**Annotation (Zhù):** *"The argumentative"* (辩者) refer to **those skilled in speech** (巧言).
*"Not good"* (不善) means **the harm of verbal governance** (舌政患).

**Earth has jade** (土有玉), **digging its mountains** (掘其山),
**Water has pearls** (水有珠), **muddying its springs** (浊其泉).
**Excessive speech destroys the self** (辩口多言亡其身).

「○**Commentary (Shū):** *辫 (biàn)*, **to distinguish** (bié yě).
Those who truly grasp the **Dao/Way** (至道 zhìdào) **do not argue** (故无可分别 yě), for they **point and scold at Heaven and Earth** (指骂天地 zhǐmà tiāndì) as if nothing could be distinguished.

Moreover, **Confucians and Mohists** (儒墨 rúmò) **cling to right and wrong** (是非 shìfēi), for **they stubbornly distinguish** (坚执分别 jiānzhí biéyì) **because they have yet to attain the Dao/Way of virtue** (良由未证善道 yìng yóu wèi zhèng shàndào yě).

**The Sage does not hoard** (圣人不积),
**Commentary (Shū):** The **Sage accumulates virtue** (积德 jīdé) **but not wealth** (不积财 bù jīcái). With **virtue, they teach the ignorant** (有德以教愚 yǒudé yǐ jiāoyú), and with **wealth, they relieve the poor** (有财以施贫 yǒucái yǐ shīpín).

**Master Yuè says:** Hoarding (积 jī) refers to **clinging stubbornly to doctrines and teachings** (执滞言教 zhīzhì yánjiào), **amassing knowledge or possessions** (有所积聚 yǒusuǒ jījù).
The **Sage comprehends speech and transcends speech** (了言忘言 liǎoyán wàngyán), **awakens to teachings and discards teachings** (悟教遣教 wùjiào qiǎnjiào). **They hold no fixed distinctions** (一无执滞 yīwú zhīzhì), thus it is said they **do not hoard** (故云不积 yě).

**Commentary (Shū):** *积 (jī)*, **to amass** (jù yě).
The **Sage possesses wealth to benefit beings** (有财惠物 yǒucái huìwù) and **virtue to teach people** (有德教人 yǒudé jiàorén), yet they **do not hoard** (故不积 yě).
**The more they give to others, the more they possess** (既以为人己愈有 jì yǐ wèirén jǐ yùyǒu), **the more they share with others, the more they have** (既以与人己愈多 jì yǐ yǔrén jǐ yùduō).
**Commentary (Zhù):** When they **bestow wealth and practice almsgiving** (既以财贿布施与人 jì yǐ cāihuì bùshī yǔrén), their **wealth grows ever more abundant** (而财益多 ér cái yìduō), **like the radiance of the sun and moon** (如日月之光 rú rìyuè zhī guāng), **endless without depletion** (无有尽时 wúyǒu jìnshí yě).

**Commentary (Shū):** *既 (jì)*, **to exhaust** (jìn yě).
*为 (wèi)*, **to transform and bestow** (施化 shīhuà yě).
Though they **exhaust their own virtue and power** (己所有道德 jǐ yǒudé) **to teach others** (尽持教人 jìnhú jiàorén), their **heart is without pettiness or fear** (心无鄙怯 xīnwú bǐqiè), and their **virtue becomes ever more sublime and distant** (德弥高远 dé mí gāoyuǎn). Thus it is said they **possess all the more** (故言愈有 yě), for this is **virtue in action** (此德施 shì déshī).
Though they **exhaust their own treasures** (己所有财宝 jǐ yǒuzāng) **to scatter them in charity** (尽持施散 jìnhú shīsàn), the **fruits of their merit grow ever more abundant** (而果报弥多 ér guǒbào míduō), hence it is said they **have all the more** (故云愈多 yě). This is **wealth in giving** (此财施 shì cāishī).

The **Dao/Way of Heaven** (天之道 tiān zhīdào) **benefits without harming** (利而不害 lì ér bùhài);
**Commentary (Zhù):** Heaven **nurtures all things** (生万物 shēng wànwù), **loving and fostering their growth** (爱育之 àiyù zhī), **allowing them to flourish without injury** (令长大无所伤害其生 lìng zhǎngdà wúsuǒ shānghài qí shēng yě).

**Commentary (Shū):** The **natural Dao/Way of Heaven** (天然之道 tiānrán zhīdào) **gives rise to all things** (生成万物 shēngchéng wànwù), **its benefits vast and manifold** (利益弘多 lìyì hóngduō), yet **it causes no loss or harm** (有何损害 yǒuhé sǔnhài).

The **Dao/Way of the Sage** (圣人之道 shèngrén zhīdào) **acts without striving** (为而不争 wèi ér bùzhēng);
**Commentary (Zhù):** The **Sage follows Heaven’s Dao/Way** (法天 fǎtiān), **acting without contrivance** (无所施为 wúsuǒ shīwéi), **transforming all things to their natural fulfillment** (化成事就 huàchéng shìjiù). They **do not contend with the world for fame or gain** (不与天下争功名 bùyǔ tiānxià zhēng gōngmíng), thus **their sagehood remains whole** (故能全其圣功 yě).

**Commentary (Shū):** The **Sage’s highest virtue** (上德 shàngdé) **is aligned with the Dao/Way’s boundless flow** (法道虚通 fǎdào xūtōng), **their actions pure and transformative** (施为至教 shīwéi zhìjiào). Their **teachings permeate all beings** (化被群品 huàbèi qúnpǐn), **they nurture themselves with humility** (谦以自牧 qiān yǐ zìmù), **yet they do not claim credit** (成功不居 chénggōng bùjū). **They attribute their achievements to the things themselves** (推功於物 tuīgōng yú wù), thus it is said they **do not contend** (故云不争 yě).

**Master Zhāng says:** Those who speak of **having carriages and boats yet no means to ride or sail** (有舟舆无所乘之 yǒuzhōuyú wúsuǒ chéngzhī), **are like the world of non-action** (山无蹊跶 shānmí xītì), where **marshes lack bridges or paths** (泽无舟梁 zémí zhōuliáng). **They sever all coming and going** (本绝往来 běn jué wǎnglái), **so what need have they for conveyance or use** (何所乘用 hésuǒ chéngyòng).

**Again it states:** Though they **possess arms and armor**, they **have no place to deploy them** (无所陈之 wúsuǒ chénzhī).

**Master Gù says:** Arms **are used to punish rebels** (讨逆 tǎonì), and **martial might is employed to quell disorder** (静乱 jìngluàn). **Since the Sage practices the Dao/Way**, the people **turn to virtue** (下乃好德 xiànǎi hàodé), and **all naturally conform to transformation** (自然从化 zìrán cónghuà). **Why then would there be any need to deploy arms** (何事陈兵 héshì chénbīng)?
