**Scroll Three of the Expanded Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***

**Chapter Nine: "Holding Fullness Without Excess"**
*"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them well.
Wealth and honor breed arrogance—self-inflicted ruin follows."*

**Expanded Commentary:**
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records that **Bai Gong Sheng** of Chu, though he held the kingdom, could not distribute its treasures to the people.

**Manuscript Annotation:**
From the *Huainanzi*’s *"Honglie Jiedao Training"*:
Bai Gong’s given name was **Sheng**; he was enfeoffed at Bai, hence "Bai Gong." He was the grandson of Chu Ping Wang and son of Crown Prince Jian.

*(Note: The full account is already preserved in the original text.)*

**Expanded Commentary:**
In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Ruan Xuanzhi** (Range the Elder), son of Fan Wenzi, governed as chief minister during the reign of Duke Zhao of Lu. The tribute from other lords grew heavy.

**Manuscript Annotation:**
The people of Zheng resented this, so **Zi Chan** (Child of Production, i.e., **Zi Chan of Zheng**, named **Qiu**, the senior minister) sent a letter to Xuanzhi.
*(Zi Chan was the chief minister of Zheng.)*
*"Leaving a message"* (寓书) means sending a letter.
This is to inform Xuanzhi.

*(The full account is already complete and need not be repeated.)*

**Expanded Commentary:**
In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Wang Zi Chao** and **Bin Meng** were favored by King Jing of Zhou, who wished to establish Meng as heir.

**Manuscript Annotation:**
Wang Zi Chao was the eldest son of King Jing.
Bin Meng’s given name was **Qi**, and he was Chao’s tutor.
Meng said:
*"Why should a rooster fear being used by man?*
*Men differ from this.*
Though the sacrificial rooster may be adorned with honor, it will still be slaughtered.
If a man is adorned with honor, he will rise to nobility—his fate differs from the rooster’s."*

*(This implies Meng advised Chao to let the king bestow early favor upon him, lest he later be discarded.)*
*"When achievement is complete and name secured, withdrawal is the Dao of Heaven."*

**Expanded Commentary:**
The *Classic of Changes* states:
*"To know advancement yet not retreat, to know preservation yet not destruction, to know gain yet not loss—only the Sage avoids the regret of excess."*

**Manuscript Annotation:**
From the *Zhouyi* (Commentary on the *Yijing*), the *File of Qian* (乾卦) states:
*"‘Excess’ (亢) means—*
*to know advancement yet not retreat,*
*to know preservation yet not destruction,*
*to know gain yet not loss—*
*who but the Sage can do this?*
*Who but the Sage knows advancement, retreat, preservation, destruction, gain, and loss without losing the proper way?"*

This clarifies the meaning of the **ninth line of Qian**.
*"If one does not know advancement, retreat, preservation, destruction, gain, or loss,*
*then this uppermost line (上九) will bring regret through excess.*
*This is because of these three failings.*
*If one fully knows these three, even in the highest position, one will not exceed."*

**Expanded Commentary:**
*"When the sun reaches its zenith, it declines.
When the moon is full, it wanes.
The seasons cycle—achievement brings withdrawal."*

**Manuscript Annotation (Du Qujing’s Interpretation):**
*"When the sun is at its peak, the moon at its full,*
*summer gives way to winter,*
*spring’s flourish yields to autumn’s fall—*
*such is the Dao of Heaven.*
If man aligns with Heaven’s fullness and emptiness,
forgets merit and name,
withdraws from office and declines honor,
he will not stray from Heaven’s natural cycles—
then there will be no cause for blame."*

**Expanded Commentary:**
Take **Zhang Liang of Han**, the **Leave-Home Master** (i.e., **Zhang Zifang**).
Though ennobled with a ten-thousand-house fief,
he abandoned worldly affairs to follow **Chisongzi** (赤松子).

During the **Han Xuan Emperor’s** reign, **Su Guang** (字仲翁), whose nephew **Su Shou** was his adopted son, both hailed from **Lanling, Donghai**.
Guang served as **Grand Tutor to the Heir Apparent**, while Shou was **Minor Tutor**.
Guang said:
*"I have heard: ‘Knowing when to stop brings no peril; knowing contentment brings no disgrace.’*
*I have also heard: ‘When achievement is complete and name secured, withdrawal is the Dao of Heaven.’"*

Father and son thus resigned on grounds of illness.
The Emperor granted them **thirty *jin* of gold**, while the Heir Apparent gave **fifty *jin***.
They submitted a memorial requesting retirement and returned home.
Is this not the Dao of Heavenly withdrawal?

**Chapter Ten: Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One**

When nurturing the vital essence and embracing the One,
how could it ever depart?

**Explanatory Elucidation:**
*"To bear"* (載) means to carry by vehicle.
*"To bear"* (載) also means to ascend by vehicle.

Quoted from *Broad Exalted Meaning*:
*"Nurturing the vital essence"*—
The human body is where spirit-qi resides and where soul-spirit (魂魄) takes form.
To move and carry the body is like a vehicle bearing goods.
The *Western Ascension Scripture* states:
*"The body is the chariot of the spirit."*
Since it is likened to a vehicle, it must be carried.

The **empty shell** (虚魄) is the manifestation of yin-qi—
the form of a person.
Yang-qi is formless—
the spirit of a person,
the vessel of form.
Yet when yang-qi has not yet descended,
it lies inert, devoid of awareness,
like a dull stone or withered wood.
When yang-qi descends,
it gains movement—
thus, form is called *arcane shell* (魄), belonging to yin.
Spirit is called *soul* (魂), belonging to yang.
As long as there remains even a thread of yang-qi,
death cannot be complete.
As long as there remains even a thread of yin-qi,
transcendence cannot be achieved.
Thus, refining yin-qi to exhaustion grants ascent to the Nine Heavens as an immortal,
consorting with yang.
Refining yang-qi to exhaustion plunges one to the Nine Abysses as a ghost,
consorting with yin.
Therefore, one must preserve the yang-soul,
nurture the yin-shell,
to safeguard life,
embrace the One and uphold the Dao,
lest it ever depart for an instant.

**Explanatory Elucidation:**
Qu Yuan’s *Li Sao* states:
*"Bearing the vital essence and ascending the crimson mist,
parting the floating clouds to mount upward."*

Quoted:
Qu Yuan was a Grand Minister of the Three Gorges in Chu.
*Li Sao* is the title of his literary work.
*"Bearing the vital essence"* means to carry soul-spirit and ascend the crimson mist—
the crimson mist being the rising vapor of earthly breath.
*"Clouds"* refers to the vapors of mountains and rivers.
*"Parting"* means to depart.
To depart from floating clouds,
to carry soul-spirit,
to stride across the crimson mist and soar,
to part from floating clouds and ascend—
this is the mastery of qi to achieve supreme softness.
Could it be like the infant brother?

**Explanatory Elucidation:**
Thus it is said:
*"Hold firm to your resolve, yet do not exhaust your qi."*
*"Shuffling"* and *"hurrying"*—
these are movements of qi,
yet they agitate the mind.

Quoted from *Mencius’ Discussion with Gongsun Chou, Upper Section*:
Gongsun Chou was a disciple of Mencius from Qi.
He saw Mencius speak of resolve first, then qi.
Thus he asked:
*"If so, then focusing solely on resolve suffices."*
Again he asked:
*"Why must one not exhaust qi?"*
Mencius replied:
*"When resolve is singular, it moves qi.
**Annotation:** *Singular* means unified.
*Shuffling* means stumbling.
*Hurrying* means rushing.
Mencius said that when resolve is directed with singularity,
qi follows inevitably.
Yet when qi is concentrated in one direction,
resolve itself is moved in turn—
as when a person stumbles or rushes,
qi is fixed upon that action,
and the mind is disturbed in return.
Thus one must hold firm to resolve
while ensuring qi is not exhausted."*

**Explanatory Elucidation:**
*"To wail all day yet the throat unsore—
this is the pinnacle of harmony."*

Quoted from the original text of *Chapter Fifty-Five: The Depth of Virtue*.
Sū’s annotation:
*"When the heart stirs, qi is injured.
When qi is injured, the throat grows sore.
To wail all day yet the throat unsore—
this proves the heart undisturbed and qi in harmony."*

**Could governance of the people and the realm be without action?**

**Explanatory Elucidation:**
*"Cultivate within yourself, and virtue becomes genuine.
Cultivate for the world, and virtue becomes universal."*

Quoted from *Bìxū Zhēnrén’s* *Subtle Gatherings*:
*"Nearly applied to the self, yet extending far to the world."*
To cultivate the Dao within the body—
few thoughts, few desires—
extends life and strengthens vitality,
while all falsehoods are exhausted.

Sū’s elucidation:
*"Once the self is cultivated,
its virtue naturally extends outward,
even to governing the world."*

**Could the opening and closing of the Celestial Gate be without duality?**

**Explanatory Elucidation:**
The *Celestial Gate* is the gate of Nature.
Nature gives birth to the Supreme Ultimate.

Quoted from *Zhuangzi’s* *"Gēngsāng Chú"*:
Guo Xiang’s annotation:
*"The Celestial Gate is the name of the origin of all things.
It is called the Celestial Gate.
It is also called the Gate of All Marvels."*
Chéng Fashi said:
*"Heaven is the name of Nature.
The principles of creation and transformation,
though named, lack substance—
only observing all things emerging from this gate,
thus the Scripture calls it the Gate of All Marvels."*

**Explanatory Elucidation:**
Zhuangzi said:
*"There is birth, there is death,
there is exit, there is entry."*

Quoted from *Zhuangzi’s* *"Gēngsāng Chú"*—
the text has already been detailed.

**Translation:**

Again, the *Yì Jì* says:
*"Opening the gate is called **Qián (乾)**,
closing the gate is called **Kūn (坤)**,
alternating closure and opening is called **change (變)**.
Endless coming and going is called **harmony (通)**.
Bright and clear in all directions—
how could one remain unaware?"*

**Explanatory Elucidation** continues:
*"Like the reflection of objects in a mirror."*

Quoted from **Bìxū (碧虚)**:
*"This is used to illustrate the mirror—
the mirror’s inherent clarity and purity,
yet sometimes obscured by dimness,
for dust and grime adhere to it.
If one wipes away the dust and grime,
all things are reflected with perfect lucidity.
This metaphorizes the practitioner of Dao,
who nurtures their **hún (魂)** and **pò (魄)**,
embracing unity (抱一),
preventing separation—
then their true nature (一性) shines forth."*

**Explanatory Elucidation** continues:
*"Thus, the ruler of a state,
though their **virtue/power (德)** be bright and clear,
like the sun and moon illuminating the land,
should practice **withdrawing the senses (收視反聽)**,
sealing their ears (塞聪) and dimming their sight (蔽明),
so that the common folk live their daily lives
unaware of its presence."*

Quoted from *Guǎng Shèng Yì (廣聖義)*:
*"Bright and clear—
the wisdom of illumination (明白慧照).
The wisdom of illumination,
without near or far—
when the mind is stilled,
the heart forgotten,
it is as though one has no knowledge.
If one boasts of their knowledge,
they cling to attachments
and lose the Dao."*

*"The sovereign bears the singular vision (負獨見之明),
governing their realm—
yet their governance (政察察) is too scrutinizing,
and the people grow weary and impoverished.
The **Laozi (老君)** warns against this,
commanding them to forget their deeds (忘功),
cease their illumination (息照),
just as one might stuff their ears with cloth (黈纩塞耳)
to close their hearing,
or let their crown veil (冕旒垂目)
obscure their sight—
this too is the meaning of **withdrawing the senses (收視反聽)**,
sealing their ears (塞聪) and dimming their sight (蔽明),
so that the common folk live their daily lives
unaware of its presence."*

The text above has already been detailed—
no need to repeat it.
**Thirty Spokes Chapter (三十辐章)**, the eleventh.

**Thirty Spokes Chapter (三十辐章)**

The thirty spokes converge at a single hub—
when the hub is empty, its use is fulfilled.

**Elaborated Meaning:**
The *Zhou Li* (《周礼》) *Kaogong Ji* (考工记) states:
*"The carriage roof is round to symbolize Heaven,
the carriage body is square to symbolize Earth."*

The meaning is clear—no further elaboration is needed.

When one hollows out doors and windows to make a dwelling,
its emptiness is what makes it useful.

**Elaborated Meaning:**
In antiquity, people lived in caves.
The *Yi* (《易》) *Xici* (系辞) says:
*"In the upper antiquity, people dwelled in caves and lived in the wilds;
later, the sages transformed this with palaces and dwellings."*

The hexagram *Dazhuang* (大壮) is taken.
In the upper antiquity, before palaces were built,
people merely nested in summer and dwelled in caves in winter.
Thus, dwellings were constructed to replace this.

**Elaborated Meaning:**
The *Shijing* (《诗》) says:
*"Taofu, Taofu—digging and covering the cave."*
Meaning: they dug into the earth and covered it above.

The *Mao Shisan* (《毛诗》) on *Wenwang’s* (文王) *Mian* (绵) ode says:
*"Ancient Gong Danfu,
dug and covered the cave—
no home yet existed."*

Ancient Gong was the Duke of Nan (邠公).
*Ancient* means *long-standing*.
*Dan* is his given name.
He was the ancestor of King Wen.

Dwelling in Nan, he governed with virtue,
and many followed him.
Though he had no residence,
he shaped the earth and covered it,
dug the ground and hollowed it—
father, son, husband, wife dwelling together became a *family*.

**Annotations:**
The ministers of feudal lords addressed their lord as *Jun* (君).
*Fu* (复) means to cover upon the earth.
*Zaotü* (凿穴) means to dig—all like the shaping of clay.
This is like the kilns of today.

**Elaborated Meaning:**
Zhuangzi says:
*"If a dwelling has no empty space,
mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will clash in the paths."*
The *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》) *Waiwu* (外物) chapter says:
*"If a dwelling has no empty space,
the paths become narrow and congested,
and mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will quarrel over passage."*

The daughter-in-law should yield to her mother-in-law as a mark of filial piety,
yet now they contend over paths,
with nowhere to go but to harbor private grudges—
this leads to rebellion and strife.

Thus, *having* is for *utility*,
*emptiness* is for *use*.

**Elaborated Meaning:**
The *Yi* (《易》) says:
*"That which is above form is called the Dao;
that which is below form is called instruments."*
From the *Yi* (《易》) *Xici* (系辞).

The *Guangsheng Yi* (《广圣义》) says:
*"That which is above form is the root of the Dao—
pure, tranquil, and non-acting in its loftiness.
That which is below form is the function of the Dao—
receiving essence and flowing into form in its lowliness."*

**Five Colors Chapter (五色章) [Twelfth]**

The five colors blind the eyes,
the five tones deafen the ears,
the five flavors dull the palate.

**Elaborated Meaning:**
The five colors were established
to manifest the symbols of the Five Phases.
Embroidered patterns of *fǔfú* (黼黻) distinguish the adornments of rank.

**Annotations:**
The five colors are: *qīng* (青, blue-green), *huáng* (黄, yellow), *bái* (白, white), *chì* (赤, red), *hēi* (黑, black).
The Five Phases: *jīn* (金, metal), *mù* (木, wood), *shuǐ* (水, water), *huǒ* (火, fire), *tǔ* (土, earth).

*Fǔfú* (黼黻) embroidery—
the *Shangshu* (《尚书》) *Yì Jì* (益稷) says:
*"The Emperor said to Shun:
'You are my arms, legs, ears, and eyes.
I wish to govern left and right with the people—
you shall assist me.
I wish to exert strength in the four directions—
you shall lead.
I wish to observe the symbols of ancient times—
the sun, moon, stars, mountains, dragons, and *huá-chóng* (华虫),
so make them manifest.
The ancestral vessels, *zǎo* (藻), fire, powdered rice, *fǔfú* (黼黻), *xì* (絺), and embroidery—
with five colors vividly applied,
make the garments—
you shall clarify them.'*

**Explanation:**
Whenever *rǔ* (汝) is spoken,
it refers to the ministers of the time—
those below Yu.

The making of garments must be distinguished:
*Clothing* (衣) is for the upper body,
*skirt* (裳) is for the lower.
Together, they have twelve chapters
to differentiate the adornments of rank.

All clothing is dark (*xián* 玄),
all skirts are embroidered (*shù* 肃, *qǐ* 绮).
The sun, moon, stars, mountains, dragons, and *huá-chóng* (华虫)—
these six patterns appear on the clothing,
and are also seen on the ancestral vessels in the ancestral temple.

*Zǎo* (藻), fire, powdered rice, *fǔ* (黼), *fú* (黻)—
these six are embroidered on *xì* (絺) for the skirts alone.

The sun, moon, stars symbolize *clarity*,
the mountains symbolize *benevolence*.

The dragon symbolizes the manifestation of transformation.

The *huá-chóng* (华虫) are creatures of luminous clarity.

The Sage governs the world with clarity,
and enacts virtue through action—
though their methods may be unfathomable,
yet their governance, teachings, laws, and rites are fully realized.
With these, they rule the people,
and the people find peace.
With these, they serve the spirits,
and the spirits are honored.
Thus, these six motifs appear on the ancestral vessels,
and again on the garments.

Softness, compliance, purity, and cleanliness—
these are the qualities of *zǎo* (藻),
fit for presenting offerings.

Radiance, brightness, and swiftness—
these are the qualities of fire,
fit for cooking and preparation.

Rice nourishes humanity,
powdered rice (粉) adorns the world,
while *fǔ* (黼) serves as a boundary,
and *fú* (黻) distinguishes rank.

The Sage adorns truth with *zǎo*,
and polishes the Dao of kingship with powdered rice,
to nourish the world—
lying in their ability to set boundaries while maintaining distinction.

Only then can governance be perfected.
These six motifs appear on the skirts.

Yet later generations, with their embroidered finery,
pursued dazzling hues—
green and yellow, pleasing to the eye,
but straying into excess,
draining vitality and dimming wisdom,
unable to perceive the color beyond color.
What else could this be but blindness?
This is the corruption of the five colors.

**Extended Meaning:**
The establishment of the five tones
was meant to manifest the sounds of the Five Phases.

Metal, stone, silk, bamboo—
these convey the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.

**Annotation:**
The five tones, as per Han Sima Xiangru’s account:
*Gōng* (宫) is centrality—
the virtue of the ruler.
*Shāng* (商) is clarity—
the completion of things.
*Jiǎo* (角) is the beginning—
the emergence of things.
*Zhēng* (征) is prosperity—
the flourishing and abundance of things.
*Yǔ* (羽) is concealment—
the gathering and storage of things.

The *Shàngshū* [益稷篇] states:
"The Emperor said:
'I wish to hear of the six *lǜ* (律), the five tones, and the eight sounds,
to govern with precision,
so that my words may be properly expressed.
You must listen.
If I err, correct me.
Do not merely assent on the surface—
afterward, speak freely.'

**Explanation:**
The six *lǜ* are:
Eleventh month—Huángzhōng (黄钟),
First month—Tàizhū (太簇),
Third month—Gūxǐ (姑洗),
Fifth month—Ruìbīn (蕤宾),
Seventh month—Yízé (夷则),
Ninth month—Wúshè (无射).

The six *lǘ* (吕) are:
Second month—Jiázhōng (夹钟),
Fourth month—Zhōnglǘ (中吕),
Sixth month—Línzhōng (林钟),
Eighth month—Nánlǘ (南吕),
Tenth month—Yìngzhōng (应钟),
Twelfth month—Tàilǘ (太吕).

These are the six *lǘ*.

The five tones are *gōng, shāng, jiǎo, zhēng, yǔ*.
The eight sounds are metal, stone, silk, bamboo, clay, wood, gourd, and leather.

You, Yu, must heed and follow these,
and thus create the *lǐ* (礼) and *fú* (服),
making them clear and manifest.

This is the corruption of the five tones above.

**Extended Meaning:**
The establishment of the five flavors
was meant to manifest the harmony of the Five Phases,
yet people indulge in coarse and refined tastes,
their appetites insatiable,
clouding their spirit and defiling their essence.

**Annotation:**
The five flavors are sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and spicy.
*Shuǎng* (爽) means "to err"—
when taste is overindulged, harm follows,
leading to deafness, blindness, and loss of discernment.

**Extended Meaning:**
The delight in *chúhuàn* (刍豢).

**Annotation:**
From *Mèngzǐ* [告子章句上]:
"Mencius said:
'The joy of ritual and righteousness to my heart
is like the joy of coarse and refined foods to my mouth.'
*Sū* (刍) refers to grass—
grass-fed animals, such as cattle and sheep.
*Huàn* (豢) refers to grain-fed livestock—
pigs and dogs of the sort.
Thus, it is said that *chúhuàn* delights the palate.

**Extended Meaning:**
The insatiable gluttony of *tāotiè* (饕餮).

**Annotation:**
Greed for wealth is called *tāo* (饕),
greed for food is called *tiè* (餮).
It speaks of those who are insatiable in their greed for wealth and food.

All these—*tāotiè*—
obscure the spirit and defile the essence,
losing their proper balance.

Hunting and falconry drive men to madness.

**Extended Meaning:**
As recorded in the *Lǐjì* [王制].

「Annotations from *Zhōulǐ* [周礼] state:
Spring *sōu* (搜), selecting those barren.
Summer *miáo* (苗), taking those that do not bear grain.
Autumn *xiàn* (狝), slaughtering in abundance.
Winter *shòu* (狩), hunting without restraint.

*Shòu* (狩) means to take without discrimination.

**Extended Meaning:**
Excessive hunting without measure—
as in Summer *Tàikāng*’s hunt beyond *Luòbiǎo* (洛表),
where the Five Sons all lamented.

**Annotation:**
Excessive hunting is recorded in *Shàngshū* [五子之歌]:
"Tàikāng occupied the throne,
indulging in ease and pleasure, destroying his virtue.
The people all turned against him.
He wandered recklessly beyond *Luòbiǎo*,
returning only after ten cycles of the moon.
The Five Sons all lamented."
The Five Sons were Tàikāng’s five younger brothers.
They composed this song to admonish *Dà Yǔ*’s warnings.

Its second verse states:
*"Teachings say:
Within, moral corruption spreads;
without, hunting grows wanton.
Sweet wine and music,
tall halls and carved walls—
if one indulges in these,
ruin is inevitable.*
Now, this serves as proof:
If laws are disregarded,
chasing wild pursuits without restraint,
exhausting the land and harming farmers,
climbing cliffs and crossing dangers,
returning only after months—
what else but madness could follow?
This is the folly of hunting."

**Extended Meaning:**
The *Aī Gōng* of *Qí* loved hunting,
a subject of poetic censure.

**Annotation from *Máo Shī* [毛诗卷第五]:
*"Returning, he censures wastefulness."*
Aī Gōng delighted in hunting,
following beasts without restraint,
and the people imitated him,
making it a national custom.
Skill in hunting was called *xián* (accomplished),
leisure in chasing was called *hào* (virtuous).
Rare treasures became obstacles to conduct.

**Extended Meaning:**
The *Míngyuè* (明月) Jewel.

**Annotation:**
From *Tōngjiàn* [通鉴], *Xiǎnwáng*’s fourteenth year:
When *Qí* and *Wèi* met for a hunt in the wilds,
*Wèi Huì Wáng* asked *Qí Wēi Wáng*:
"Does *Qí* possess any treasures?"
Wēi Wáng replied, "None."
Huì Wáng said, "Though my kingdom is small,
I still have ten *jǐncùn* pearls—
each illuminating twelve chariots before and behind."
Wēi Wáng said, "What I treasure differs from yours.
I have *Tán Zǐ*, who guards the southern city—
then the *Chǔ* dare not raid.
*Yǎn Zǐ*, who guards *Gāotáng*—
then the *Zhào* dare not fish east of the *Hé*.
*Pínfū*, who guards *Xúzhōu*—
then *Yān* and *Zhào* migrate there, seventy families strong.
*Zhǒngshǒu*, who guards against thieves—
then the roads are safe, no lost goods.
These four ministers illuminate a thousand *lǐ*—
how much more than twelve chariots!"
Huì Wáng was ashamed.

**Extended Meaning:**
The *Yèguāng* (夜光) Pearl.

**Annotation:**
The *Chū* king possessed a *Yèguāng* pearl.
Asked where it came from, he replied:
*"A Chū minister, *Suī Hòu*, once traveled
and saw a cowherd boy strike a snake,
wounding it fatally.
Suī Hòu pitied it, saved it, washed it in water,
and sealed its wound with medicine—reviving it.
The snake vanished into the water,
returning as the *Hǎilóng Wáng*’s son.
Later, it brought a seven-*cùn* pearl in gratitude.
Suī Hòu presented it to the *Chū* king,
who placed it on his hall at night—
its light illuminated the palace,
earning it the name *Yèguāng* pearl."*

**Extended Meaning:**
Mencius said:
*"Treasure jade and pearls,
and calamity will befall."*

**Annotation from *Mèngzǐ* [尽心章句下]:
Mencius said:
"The treasures of a ruler are three:
land, people, and governance.
Treasure jade and pearls,
and calamity will befall."
*Yín Shì* commented:
*"Those who hold true treasure are secure;
those who lose true treasure are in peril."*

**Extended Meaning:**
Thus, when *Xī Lǚ* presented the *Yáng* (獒) hound,
*Chào Gōng* composed a warning to *Zhōu Wǔ Wáng*.

**Annotation from *Shàngshū* [旅獒篇]:
*"Xī Lǚ presented the *Yáng* hound."*
The western *Yáng* people offered a great dog—
four *chǐ* tall, called *Yáng*,
remarkable for its size.
*Tàibǎo* composed *"Lǚ Yáng."*
Chào Gōng, named *Shì*, served as *Tàibǎo*,
admonishing *Wǔ Wáng* with these words:
*"Ah!
A sage king governs with virtue,
and all distant peoples come as guests.
None are too far or near—
all bring their offerings.
If one does not create useless things,
great achievements are made.
If one does not value rare objects
but instead values useful ones,
the people will prosper.
Dogs and horses not native to the land
should not be kept.
Exotic birds and beasts
do not benefit the state—
they only bring harm.
If one does not treasure distant objects,
distant peoples will respect.
If one treasures only the virtuous,
nearby peoples will be at ease.
Thus, it is said:
Rare treasures obstruct conduct."*

**Extended Meaning:**
*Lín Yì* presented a five-colored parrot,
and *Wèi Zhèng* advised *Tàizōng* against it.

**Annotation:**
During *Zhēnguān*’s reign,
*Lín Yì* offered a white parrot,
renowned for its eloquence,
often speaking of cold and hunger.
The emperor, moved by pity,
ordered its envoy to return it to the wilds.
*Zǎixiàng Wèi Zhèng*, of *Jùlǔ*,
then submitted a memorial urging restraint.

**Extended Meaning:**
Once, a man of *Qí* desired gold.

**Annotation from *Lièzǐ* [说符第八篇]:
As recorded in its text,
already fully cited.»

Thus, the Sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes,
and so abandons that to take this.

**Extended Meaning:**
He who does not act for the eyes
abandons the Six Passions and his eyes do not gaze in vain.

**Annotation:**
*"The Six Passions"*—
honor, wealth, high rank, grandeur, reputation,
and profit—are what excites the will.

**Commentary:**
Honor, wealth, high rank, grandeur,
reputation, and profit—these six things
are the instruments that disrupt the mind and will.

**Extended Meaning:**
Speaking of the harm of the Five Dusts,
one should forget external things to preserve the True.

**Annotation from *The Dao of the Jade Emperor* [玉皇本行经]:**
The Six Dusts stain one-sidedly,
the Three Actions are bound by glory.
What are the Six Dusts?
The dusts of the six sense-bases—
eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
These ranks of offenders have long fallen into the sufferings of *kalpa* [劫难],
indulging their dust-clouded natures,
seeing nothing clearly,
and thus are stained by the Six Dusts.

*Wáng Shǒu Zhèng* of *Wǔfēng Qīng’ān Yìshì* [五峰清安逸士]:
Chapter Thirteen: *"Favor and Humiliation"* [宠辱章]

**Favor and Humiliation**

What is meant by favor and humiliation?
Favor is lowly—
to receive it is as if in shock,
to lose it is as if in shock:
this is called the shock of favor and humiliation.

*The Extended Commentary* states:
The child of *Lǐzi* [列子] bore a hungry look.
Its meaning is already detailed in the *Extended Commentary*.

**Zǐ Wén** [子文], the *Língyīn* [令尹] of Chu,
held office three times as *Língyīn*,
yet showed no joyous expression.
When dismissed three times,
he bore no angry look.

**Annotation**:
*Língyīn* [令尹]—a title of Chu’s highest minister.
Zǐ Wén [子文] (surname: Dòu [斗], given name: Gǔyúzhū [谷於菟]),
as a man, neither his joy nor anger was evident;
he was undivided in his relation to things.
Yet his three promotions and three dismissals
all came from *heavenly principle* [天理],
and he harbored no private human desires.

*The Extended Commentary* states:
Liù Xià Huì [柳下惠] served as a *shìshī* [士师],
was dismissed three times,
yet did not leave.
People said: "Master, can you not depart?"
He replied: "I follow the *Dao/Way* in serving others—
where would I go and not be dismissed?
If I bend the *Dao/Way* to serve others,
why must I abandon my parents’ land?"

**Annotation**:
*Shìshī* [士师]—a judicial officer.
Though dismissed three times,
he did not leave,
and his demeanor was dignified and composed—
thus, he may be called wise.
Yet his resolve to never compromise the *Dao/Way*
was firm and unyielding.
This is what is meant by
*"he must follow his own Dao/Way and never lose himself."*

*The Extended Commentary* states:
**Zhèng Kǎo Fǔ** [正考父], the great-grandson of *Mǐnggōng* [愍公] of Sòng,
was promoted three times—
once, he walked hunched,
twice, he walked stooped,
thrice, he walked bowed,
following walls as he went—
who would dare to act disorderly?

**Annotation**:
*Zhèng* [考]—accomplished.
*Kǎo* [考]—great.
With accomplished great virtue and upright *Dao/Way*,
he was named **Zhèng Kǎo Fǔ** [正考父],
thus a noble ancestor of Confucius,
a Sòng minister.
At the first promotion, he walked hunched;
at the second, he walked stooped;
at the third, he walked bowed,
following walls in utmost reverence and humility—
who would dare to commit wrongdoing and defy him?

What is meant by *"treating great calamities as one’s own body"*?
My great calamity arises
from my having a body—
and when I have no body,
what calamity do I face?

*The Extended Commentary* states:
To destroy one’s *support* [隳支体],
to dismiss one’s *cleverness* [黜聪明],
to sever one’s form and abandon one’s *intelligence* [离形去智],
to merge with the *Great Harmony* [大同],
then there is nothing that enters
without one finding it in accord with oneself.

**Annotation**:
*Dà Tóng* [大同]—the *Great Harmony*.
**Yán Huì** [颜回] replied to *Zhōngnǐ* [仲尼]’s words.
On another day, he said:
"Huì has made progress."
Zhōngnǐ asked: "How so?"
Huì replied: "I have attained *zuòwàng* [坐忘]."

**Annotation**:
*Zuòwàng* [坐忘]—*forgetting through sitting*.
With a mind emptied of attachment,
one can sit upright and forget.
Zhōngnǐ frowned—*in surprise*—
and asked: "What is *zuòwàng*?"
Yán Huì [颜回] said: "To destroy one’s *support* [隳支体]."

**Annotation**:
*Hidden* [隳]—to ruin or abandon.
*Dismissed* [黜]—to withdraw or cast aside.
*Severed* [离]—to part from.

Though the ears hear and the eyes perceive,
yet the *virtue/power* of clarity [德明] originates in the heart.
Once the spirit awakens to the One,
the body is no longer bound by myriad phenomena—all is emptiness.
Thus, one can abandon the four senses and a hundred limbs,
dismissing the cleverness of the mind and the intelligence of the heart.

**Great Harmony** [大通]—this is the **Great Dao/Way** [大道].
The Dao can give birth to ten thousand things,
hence it is called the **Great Harmony**.

**Extended Meaning**:
As when Confucius said, *"No-self"* [毋我].
From *The Analects*, Book 5, *Zǐ Hān* [子罕], Chapter 9:
The Master rejected four things:
No scheming [毋意],
No certainty [毋必],
No rigidity [毋固],
No-self [毋我].

**Huì Àn’s Commentary**:
To utterly sever all attachments.
*"Po"* [毋] in *Records of the Grand Historian* [《史记》] is written as *"wú"* [无], meaning *"not"* or *"without"*.
*Yì* [意]—private inclination.
*Nèi* [必]—fixed expectation.
*Gù* [固]—obstinate adherence.
*Wó* [我]—selfish ego.
These four are cyclically linked:
Inclination arises first,
certainty follows,
rigidity enforces it,
and ego solidifies it.
For inclination often precedes action,
while ego solidifies after—
when ego begets new inclination,
worldly desires drag one in an endless cycle.

**Extended Meaning**:
As when **Nánguō Zǐ Qí** [南郭子綦] lost his self.
From *Zhuangzi* [《庄子》], *"Qí Wù Lùn"* [齐物论]:
Nánguō Zǐ Qí reclined against his staff and sat,
gazing upward to the sky and sighing—
his expression seemed to have lost his mate.
Since he harmonized with Heaven and humanity,
discarding distinctions of self and other,
he stood alone in joyless dissolution,
as though bereft of his pair.

Yán Chéng Zǐ Yóu stood before him and asked:
"Why this state?
Can one truly make the body like withered wood,
and the heart like dead ashes?
The reclining figure before me is not the same as before!"

Zǐ Qí replied:
"Yǎn, is this not excellent?
Yet you ask of it.
Now, I have lost my self—do you understand?"
This is also akin to saying *"I have no body"* [吾无身].
When one attains such a state,
former honors and humiliations fade away—
what need remains for them?

Thus, to cherish the body as the world’s treasure,
as though it could be entrusted with the world,
to love the body as the world’s foundation,
as though it could bear the world’s weight.

**Extended Meaning**:
As when **Shùn’s** [舜] offering the throne to **Zǐzhōu Zhīfù** [子州支父].
From *Zhuangzi* [《庄子》], *"Ràng Wáng Piān"* [让王篇]:
Shùn offered the throne to Zǐzhōu Zhīfù—also called Zhīfù.
He said: *"I suffer from a deep affliction,
and must first attend to it—
I have no leisure to govern the world."*

**Commentary**:
Surname Zǐ, given name Zhōu, styled Zhīfù—
a recluse who harbored the Dao within.
Shùn, recognizing his virtue, offered him the throne.
Zhīfù explained:
*"Yōu"* [幽]—profound and secluded.
*"Yōu"* [忧]—laboring in care.
He said his mind was trapped in deep seclusion,
his heart burdened with toil—
he must first cultivate himself,
so as to align with the Dao,
before he could govern the myriad affairs of state.

**Extended Meaning**:
As with **Yuè’s** [越] **Wángzǐ Sōu** [王子搜] and his followers.
From *Zhuangzi* [《庄子》], *"Ràng Wáng Piān"* [让王篇]:
The people of Yuè killed their rulers for three generations.
Wángzǐ Sōu, fearing this, fled to **Dān Xué** [丹穴]—
a cave in the southern mountains.
Yuè, having no king, searched for Wángzǐ Sōu but could not find him,
so they pursued him into the cave.
They burned him with mugwort and carried him in a jade carriage—
the royal litter.
Wángzǐ Sōu grasped the reins and ascended,
gazing upward to the sky, he cried:
*"O ruler, ruler!
Why must you abandon me?"*

Wángzǐ Sōu did not dislike being king—
he disliked the burdens of kingship.
One such as Wángzǐ Sōu
can be said to refuse letting the state harm his life.

---
**Vision Unseen** [视之不见] is called *Yí* [夷],
**Hearing Unheard** [听之不闻] is called *Xī* [希],
**Grasping Unfelt** [搏之不得] is called *Wēi* [微].

**Extended Meaning**:
**Play of the Mysterious and the Manifest** [能玄能黄].
From *The Classic of Changes* [《易》]:
*"Heaven above is round—its hue is mysterious [玄],
Earth below is square—its hue is yellow."*
From *Liezi* [《列子》], *"Tiān Ruì Piān"* [天瑞篇]:
To master *gōng* [宫] and *shāng* [商],
to embody *yīn* [阴] and *yáng* [阳],
to wield *róu* [柔] and *gāng* [刚],
to embody *yuán* [圆] and *fāng* [方],
to stretch and contract at will—
if one claims to know and to be able,
it is but a fragment of the Dao,
not its full realization.

Yet to have no knowledge yet know all,
to have no ability yet be capable of all—
then nothing is beyond reach.
No limit remains—
what cannot be done?

**Daoist Essentials**:

*Mysterious and Yellow* [玄黄], are **colors** [色].
*Gōng* [宫] and *Shāng* [商], are **sounds** [声].
*Yīn* [阴] and *Yáng* [阳], are **qi** [气].
*Róu* [柔] and *Gāng* [刚], are **materials/natures** [材].
*Yuán* [圆] and *Fāng* [方], are **vessels/forms** [器].
*Duǎn* [短] and *Cháng* [长], are **shapes** [形].
All transformations and changes,
are contained within these.

**Extended Meaning**:
*To dwell beneath as still as rubble and tiles* [在下与瓦砾同寂].
From *Zhuangzi* [《庄子》]—*"Journey to the North in Search of the Dao"* [智北游]:
**Eastern Guozi** [东郭子] asked **Zhuangzi** [庄子]:
*"Where does this Dao/Way you speak of reside?"* [所谓道，恶乎在].
**Explanation**: [疏] He dwelled in the Eastern suburb of Guo [郭], hence his name **Eastern Guozi** [居在郭东，故号东郭子].
**Guo Shunzi** [东郭顺子], was the **Master of the Unselective** [无择之师].

**Eastern Guozi** [东郭子] asked **Zhuangzi** [庄子]:
*"Where does this **Vacuous and Permeating Ultimate Dao/Way** [所谓虚通至道] reside?"*
**Zhuangzi** [庄子] replied:
*"It is nowhere not present."* [於何处在乎。无所不在。]
**Eastern Guozi** [东郭子] said:
*"Then I may seek it?"* [期而后可。]
**Zhuangzi** [庄子] replied:
*"It resides in the ant."* [指名所在。在蝼蚁。]
**Eastern Guozi** [东郭子] said:
*"How lowly!"* [曰：何其下耶。]
**Zhuangzi** [庄子] replied:
*"It resides in the weeds."* [在稊稗。]
**Eastern Guozi** [东郭子] said:
*"How even more lowly!"* [曰：何其愈下耶。]
**Zhuangzi** [庄子] replied:
*"It resides in the tiles and bricks."* [在瓦甓。]
**Eastern Guozi** [东郭子] said:
*"How much lower still!"* [曰：何其愈甚耶。]
**Zhuangzi** [庄子] replied:
*"It resides in excrement and urine."* [在屎溺。]
**Eastern Guozi** [东郭子] did not respond.
**Zhuangzi** [庄子] said:
*"Your inquiry, Master, does not reach the essential substance."* [夫子之问，固不及质。]

**The Ancient Virtuous Scholar** [古之善为士章第十五]:
The ancient virtuous scholar,
was subtle and mysterious, permeating the Dao/Way,
deep and unfathomable.
Because it was unfathomable,
one must forcefully create its semblance.

**Extended Meaning**:
**Master Liezi** [子列子] dwelled in the **Pu Garden of Zheng** [郑圃] for forty years,
yet none recognized him.
From *Liezi* [《列子》]—*"Heaven’s Auspicious Signs"* [天瑞第一]:
**Master Liezi** [子列子], is the one whose surname is **Zi** [载子於姓上者],
as noted in the first chapter:
*"This is what the disciple recorded, hence the title."* [是弟子之所记故也。]
The meaning has been detailed earlier,
and need not be repeated.

*"Like crossing a river in winter, one must fear the cold and the neighbors"* [豫若冬涉川，犹若畏四邻].
**Extended Meaning**:
**Guard against distractions and preserve sincerity** [闲邪存诚].
From *The Classic of Changes* [《周易》]—*"The Auspicious Signs of Qian"* [乾卦九二爻辞正义]:
*"One who guards against distractions and preserves sincerity"* [闲邪存其诚者],
must say:
*"Guard against distractions and preserve one’s sincerity"* [言防闲邪恶，当自存其诚实也].

**Extended Meaning**:
*"Like Eastern Guo Shunzi’s upright bearing in understanding things,
it dissipates the minds of others"* [若东郭顺子正容悟物，使人之意消].
From *Zhuangzi* [《庄子》]—*"Outer Chapters: Master Tianzi’s Garden"* [外篇田子方]:
*"Upright bearing in understanding things,
dissipates the minds of others"* [正容悟物，使人之意消].
**Master Xihua** [西华法师] **Cheng Xuan** [成玄英] **commented**:
*"When hearing things without Dao/Way,
or encountering those of perverse ways,
Eastern Guozi’s upright bearing
makes them enlightened,
dissipating their confused thoughts naturally."* [出闻无道之物，邪僻之人，东郭子正容仪，令其晓悟，使惑乱之意自然消除也。]
The full text has already been detailed in the eighth chapter *"The Supreme Good is Like Water"* [上善若水],
and need not be repeated.

**Extended Meaning**:
*"Even in a dark room, **Li Han Guang** [李含光] conducts himself as if facing his sovereign and father"* [李含光虽处暗室，如对君父].
**Master Sima** [司马子微] **praised him highly** [激赏之].
**Explanation**:
**Li Han Guang** [李含光], from *"High Daoist Transmission"* [《高道传》], ninth chapter:
*"The Daoist Li Han Guang of Jinling"* [道士李含光者，晋陵人也],
at age twelve, **devoted himself earnestly to learning the Dao/Way** [笃好学道],
even in a dark room,
his demeanor was as if facing his sovereign and father.
Others seeing him,
**his facial expressions and gestures were outwardly composed** [人见之情色外敛].

「He first mastered the art of seal script and clerical script [篆隶], some even saying he surpassed his father; yet, upon hearing the Dao/Way once, he never again took up the brush. Later, he studied under Master Zheng Yi [贞一先生].

**Master Sima** [司马子微] **said of seal script and precious books [篆宝书]**: "He emptied his purse and entrusted them to me, saying: 'This is the true **Li Han Guang**, a Daoist guest of pure **virtue/power** [真玉清仙客也].' Today, I take these two instances as proof—his conduct was steadfast and sincere, his reverence strict, truly like a guest of honor [可谓俨若客也].

**When in darkness**, the words of **Ling Sheng Zhen Jun** [翎圣真君] state:
*"Above, he is observed by the Heavenly Mirror [天鉴], below, he is scrutinized by the Earthly Spirits [地祇].*
*In the light, there are punishments that follow; in the dark, there are spirits and ghosts that attend.*
*In his actions and words, good and evil are known to him alone—*
*only what is upright can be preserved; the heart cannot be deceived.*
*Who can make turbidity cease?*
*Let stillness settle, and clarity will emerge.*
*Who can remain at peace for long?*
*Let motion arise, and disturbance will follow.*
**Extended Meaning**: *The **Yijing** [《易》] says:
*"Quietly unmoved, yet responsive—*
*thus the **Dao/Way** of all things under heaven unfolds.*
*None but the most divine of all under heaven*
*can attain this—*
*who else could be so aligned?"*
**Quoted from *Yi Xi Shang Ci*** [《易系上辞》]:
*"The **Yijing** is without thought, without action.*
*Quietly unmoved, yet responsive—*
*thus the **Dao/Way** of all things under heaven unfolds.*
*None but the most divine of all under heaven*
*can attain this—*
*who else could be so aligned?"*
**Extended Meaning**: *The Dao gathers because of its emptiness [虚].*
**Quoted from *Zhuangzi* [《庄子》]—[Chapter on **Geng Sang Chu** [庚桑楚]]:
*"The heart within is upright—*
*upright, it is still; still, it is clear; clear, it is empty; empty, it does nothing yet nothing is left undone.*
**Chapter 16: *Extreme Emptiness and Sincere Stillness*** [致虚极章第十六]:
*"Extreme emptiness, sincere stillness—*
*all things arise together,*
*and I observe their return.*
**Extended Meaning**:
*致 (zhi) means "to attain."*
*This aligns with *The Great Learning* [《大学》], where "attaining knowledge" [致知] is spoken of.*
**Quoted from *The Great Learning*** [《大学》]:
*"To sincerely settle one’s intentions [诚其意],*
*first, one must attain knowledge.*
*Attaining knowledge lies in investigating things [致知在格物].*
**Huai’an Commentary** [晦庵注]:
*"Sincere (cheng) means real [实].*
*Intentions (yi) are what the heart emits [心之所发].*
*To make real what the heart emits—*
*to align it with the good*
*and avoid self-deception.*
*致 (zhi) means to push to the utmost [推极].*
*Knowledge (zhi) is akin to discernment [识].*
*To push to the utmost one’s knowledge—*
*to exhaust all that can be known,*
*leaving nothing unattained.*
**Extended Meaning**:
*It also draws upon the meaning of "attaining" in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* [《春秋》], where the state of Chu sought to provoke the Jin army.*
**Quoted from *Spring and Autumn Annals* [《春秋》]—Year 12 of Duke Xuan [宣公十二年]**:
*"The state of Chu, under King Zhuang [庄], sought to establish terms with Jin [求成於晋].*
*Jin agreed, and a day for the covenant was set.*
*Chu’s **Gongshi** [许伯] and **Yuele Bo** [乐伯] took their places,*
*with **She Zhu** [摄叔] as the right-hand assistant,*
*and sought to challenge Jin’s commander in single combat,*
*pretending reluctance to make peace,*
*thus provoking Jin’s forces.*
*By this means of provocation,*
*the army was made into an enemy—*
*just as stillness provokes the Dao,*
*and the Dao can thus be attained."*

**Extended Meaning**: *The **Master Liezi** [列子] said:
*"Nothing surpasses stillness, nothing surpasses emptiness.*
*Stillness, emptiness—*
*these are the dwelling places one attains.*
*Taking and giving—*
*these are where one loses one’s footing.*
*If emptiness is not pushed to its utmost,*
*and stillness does not reach its sincerity,*
*then none can attain the Dao.*
*Thus, the utmost value is placed on emptiness and stillness."*

**Quoted from *Liezi* [《列子》]—[Chapter on *Heavenly Blessings* [天瑞篇]]**:
*"Someone asked **Master Liezi** [子列子]:
*'Why do you esteem emptiness?*
**Master Liezi** replied:
*'Emptiness is without esteem.*
*It is not its name that is esteemed,*
*but stillness and emptiness—*
*these are the dwelling places one attains.*
*Taking and giving—*
*these are where one loses one’s footing.*
*If emptiness is not pushed to its utmost,*
*and stillness does not reach its sincerity,*
*then none can attain the Dao.*
*Thus, the utmost value is placed on emptiness and stillness."*

**Extended Meaning**: *"All things are manifold yet my heart remains clear;*
*all transformations differ yet my heart remains still.*
*This is called **Heavenly Music** [天乐]."*

**Quoted from *Zhuangzi* [《庄子》]—[Chapter on *The Way of Heaven* [天道篇]]**:
*"To extend **stillness and emptiness** to heaven and earth,*
*and communicate with all things—*
*this is called **Heavenly Music** [天乐]."*

**Master Xi Hua** [西华法师] **commented**:
*"Thus, with a single mind settled,*
*all things submit—*
*it is only that through the wisdom of **stillness and emptiness***
*one investigates the principles of the Two **Dao/Way**s [二仪之理],*
*flows with the sentiments of all things,*
*and adapts to their transformations without fail,*
*hence it is called **Heavenly Music**."*

**Extended Meaning**: *"Let us return to the heart of heaven and earth [复其见天地之心乎]."*

**Quoted from the *Yijing* [《易》]—**Fu** [复] Hexagram’s **Simian** [彖辞]**:
*"**Fu** means to return to the origin [反本之谓也].*
*It speaks of the **Dao/Way** of **Yin-Yang** [乾元一阳之炁]*
*—from here it departs,*
*and from here it returns,*
*thus it is called **Fu** [来复].*
*It speaks of returning to the **Dao/Way**—*
*this is the movement of heaven.*
*There is advantage in forward action,*
*for the **virtue/power** of the strong grows.*
*Returning to the heart of heaven and earth—*
*this is the **Dao/Way** of **Yin-Yang** [乾元一阳之炁],*
*the still and utterly void principle.*
*The reason the initial line of the **Fu** [复] hexagram says*
*'**Hidden Dragon, No Action** [潜龙勿用]'*
*—is that the **Yang qi** [阳气] is concealed and below,*
*and this is how one sees the heart of heaven and earth.*
*Things are diverse and manifold [物芸芸],*
*yet each returns to its root.*
*Returning to the root is **stillness** [静],*
*stillness is **recovering the vital breath** [复命],*
*and recovering the vital breath is **constancy** [常].*
**Extended Meaning**: *The **Yijing** says:
*"Exhaust the principles, fathom the nature,*
*and reach the vital breath [穷理尽性以至於命].*
*The vital breath is the marvel of nature [命者，性之妙也].*
**Quoted from *Yi Xi Gua Zhengyi* [《易系卦正义》]**:
*"The vital breath is the utmost limit of life [生之极].*
*Exhausting the principles means reaching their utmost [穷理，则尽其极也].*
*Knowing constancy is clarity [知常曰明],*
*not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and disaster [不知常，妄作凶]."*

**Extended Meaning**: *Confucius said:
*"A person without constancy*
*cannot be a shaman or physician."*
**Quoted from *The Analects* [《论语》]—Book 13**:
*"The Master said:*
*'There is a saying in the south:*
*A person without constancy*
*cannot be a shaman or physician.*
*Good words these!'*
**Huai’an Commentary** [晦庵注]:
*'The southerners (nanren) are people from the southern lands.*
*Constancy (heng) means enduring steadfastness.*
*Shamans deal with spirits and ghosts,*
*physicians with life and death,*
*so even in these lowly roles,*
*constancy is especially indispensable.*
*Confucius praised their words as good."*

**Extended Meaning**: *Mencius said:
*"If a person lacks constancy,*
*they will abandon propriety and indulge in licentiousness and extravagance,*
*doing nothing they will not do for themselves.*
*Only when they fall into crime*
*does punishment follow—*
*this is to mislead the people.*
*How can a benevolent person in power*
*mislead the people and still be acceptable?"*
**Quoted from *Mencius* [《孟子》]—[Chapter on *Teng Wen Gong* [滕文公章句上]]**:
*"When people speak of the **Dao/Way** [道],*
*those who have a constant livelihood [恒产] have constant hearts [恒心],*
*and those without a constant livelihood lack constancy.*
*If a person lacks constancy,*
*they will abandon propriety and indulge in licentiousness and extravagance,*
*doing nothing they will not do for themselves.*
*Only when they fall into crime*
*does punishment follow—*
*this is to mislead the people [罔民].*
*How can a benevolent person in power*
*mislead the people and still be acceptable?"*

「**Huì'ān’s Annotation [晦庵注]**: Yáng Hǔ [阳虎], whose given name was Hǔ [虎], was a retainer of the Jì family in Lǔ [鲁季氏家臣也].
The **Dao/Way** [天理] and human desires [人欲] cannot coexist.
Hǔ’s words here fear that **virtue/power** [仁] may harm wealth [富].
Mencius cites them, fearing that wealth may harm **virtue/power** [仁].
The **noble** [君子] and the **petty** [小人] are always in opposition [每相反而已矣].
**Knowing constancy [恒] permits tolerance [容]**, tolerance becomes **impartial** [公], **impartial** becomes **the king’s** [王], **the king’s** becomes **the heavens’** [天], **the heavens’** becomes **the Dao/Way** [道], **the Dao/Way** is eternal [乃久], and one’s life will not be in peril [没身不殆].

**Extended Meaning [衍义云]**: The *Rites of Zhou* [《礼记》] states:
*"When the **Great Dao/Way** prevails,*
*the world becomes **impartial** [为公],*
*and people do not exclusively love their own parents,*
*nor exclusively cherish their own children."*
**Quoted from *Li Yùn* [《礼记□礼运篇》]**:
*"Confucius said:*
*The **Great Dao/Way** in practice,*
*the world becomes **impartial** [为公],*
*the worthy and capable are selected,*
*faithfulness is cultivated,*
*and harmony is nurtured.*
*Thus, people do not exclusively love their own parents,*
*nor exclusively cherish their own children."*

The **Dao/Way** of filial piety and compassion [孝慈] is vast [广也].
**Ensuring the aged have a place to die [终],**
**the strong have useful labor [用],**
**the young have proper growth [长],**
**and the widowed, orphaned, disabled, and infirm [矜寡孤独废疾者]**

**Five-Peak Pure and Leisurely Scholar Wang Shouzheng’s Collection**
**Chapter Seventeen: The Most Exalted Dao/Way**

The Most Exalted Dao/Way exists naturally among the people.
The next level is to honor them and praise them.

**Extended Meaning Annotation:**
*The Zuo Commentary* states:
*"The Most Exalted Dao/Way establishes virtue; the next level establishes deeds."*

Quoting from *The Spring and Autumn Annals, Duke Xiang’s Twenty-Fourth Year*:
Mu Shu went to Jin, and Fan Xuanzi received him, asking, *"The ancients said, ‘To die and yet not perish—what does this mean?’"* Mu Shu did not respond.
Fan Xuanzi said:
*"The ancestors of my house, from the time of Yu onward, were the Yao-Tang Clan. In the Xia, they were the Yu-Long Clan—this refers to Liu Lei. See the account in Duke Zhao’s Twenty-Ninth Year. In the Shang, they were the Shi-Wei Clan—Shi-Wei was the name of a state. Southeast of Bai-Ma County in Dong Commandery lies Wei City. In the Zhou, they were the Tang-Du Clan—Tang and Du were two states. At the end of the Yin, the Shi-Wei State was moved to Tang, and Duke Cheng of Zhou destroyed Tang, relocating them to Du, where they became Duke Bu of Du. Duke Bu’s son, Yi Shu, fled to Jin, and four generations later, Shi Hui received a fief in Fan, restoring the Fan Clan. Du is now Du County in Jingzhao Commandery. The Jin ruler made Fan the host of the Summer Alliance—this is what is meant, is it not?"*

Mu Shu replied:
*"From what I’ve heard, this is called ‘hereditary rank,’ not ‘not perishing.’ Ru had a former minister named Zang Wen Zhong. After his death, his words endured—this is what is meant, is it not?"*

I have heard that the Most Exalted Dao/Way establishes virtue; the next level establishes deeds; the next establishes words. Historians like Shi Yi, Zhou Ren, and Zang Wen Zhong—though time passes, they are not forgotten. This is what is meant by ‘not perishing.’ As for preserving one’s lineage and surname, guarding ancestral altars, and ensuring one’s descendants never perish—no state lacks this. The greatest of ranks cannot be called ‘not perishing.’"

**Extended Meaning Annotation:**
*"Above, like a tree branch; below, like wild deer."*

Quoting from *The Zhuangzi, Heaven and Earth Chapter*:
*"In the age of supreme virtue, no one is praised for talent, no one is employed for skill. Above, like a tree branch; below, like wild deer."*

**Explanation:**
*"Above, since there is no governance, below, all are pure and natural—like wild deer, free from royal rites."*

**Extended Meaning Annotation:**
*Zhuangzi said:*
*"When it comes to the Sage, to force oneself for benevolence, to strain for righteousness—then the world begins to doubt."*

Quoting from *The Zhuangzi, Horsefoot Chapter*:
*"When it comes to the Sage, to force oneself for benevolence, to strain for righteousness—these are the appearances of exerting effort for benevolence and righteousness. To force oneself for benevolence, to strain for righteousness—both are the outward forms of contriving benevolence and righteousness."*

**Extended Meaning Annotation:**
*"Yao’s benevolence was like the heavens; those who approached him were like the sun. Shun had a fragrant virtue, and the people rejoiced in him. Thus, he moved his capital three times to Chengdu, and when he reached Deng’s ruins, ten thousand families followed him."*

Quoting from *The Zhuangzi, Xu Wu Gui Chapter*:
*"Shun, in humble attire, wandered through Kang Qu. He heard children singing:*
*'Establish the people, do not deviate from your utmost!*
*Unknowing and unthinking,*
*Follow the Way of the Sovereign.’*
*‘Cheng’ means ‘the many.’*
*He who makes all things reach their utmost*
*does not violate their natural dispositions.*
*If one governs by knowledge and understanding,*
*how could this be in accord with the Dao of Heaven?’"*

**Extended Meaning Annotation:**
*"The people’s songs praised Shun."*

Quoting from *The Mencius, Chapter on Wan Zhang (Upper)*:
Mencius answered Wan Zhang:
*"Shun served Yao for twenty-eight years—this was not something a man could do alone; it was Heaven’s will. When Yao died, after three years of mourning, Shun moved Yao’s son to the south of the Nan River. The feudal lords who came to pay homage did not go to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who had disputes did not bring them to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who sang praises did not sing of Yao’s son but of Shun. Hence, it was Heaven’s will."*

*The Nan River is in the southern part of Ji Province, also in Yu Province. ‘Disputes’ refers to unresolved legal cases.*

The next level is to be feared and scorned.
When trust is insufficient, distrust arises.

**Extended Meaning Annotation:**
*"When the Shang made oaths, the people began to rebel. When the Zhou held alliances, the people began to doubt."*

Quoting from *The Spring and Autumn Annals, Duke Zhao’s Fourth Year*:
*"The Duke of Chu, Ling Wang, assembled the feudal lords at Shen. Jie Ju spoke to the Duke of Chu:*
*'I have heard that when feudal lords do not return in proper attire, they are not to be followed. This is the ritual norm for returning.*
*Jie Ju said:*
*'The deeds of the Six Kings and Two Dukes—*
*—the Six Kings’ deeds: Qi Yu’s fishing pavilion feast, Tang’s command at Jing Bo, Wu Wang’s assembly at Meng Jin, Cheng Wang’s search at Qi Yang, Kang Wang’s court at Tang Guan, and Mu Wang’s gathering at Tu Shan.*
*—the Two Dukes’ deeds: Qi Huan’s army at Ling and Jin Wen’s alliance at Qian Tu.*
*All these were meant to demonstrate ritual to the feudal lords, the means by which they were commanded.*
*But Xia Jie held the Ren Alliance—Ren was a state—and the ruler of Man rebelled. Shang Zhou held the search at Li—Zhou hunted in the eastern Yi state of Li—and the Yi people rebelled. Zhou You held the alliance at Da Shi—the central peak—and the barbarians rebelled against Zhou. Because of this, they rebelled against Zhou. All these were meant to show extravagance and excess to the feudal lords. The feudal lords thus abandoned their commands.*
*Now, Your Majesty, with your excess, will this not fail?’*
*The King did not listen.*

*The Shang Classics contain the text of Tang’s oath. The Zhou had the assembly at Mu Ye and Meng Jin."*

The *Yan Yi* states: **"Sincerity (chéng) is what is called *having naivety (fú) in the heart.**"*
From the *Book of Changes*, the hexagram *Zhong Fú* (Inner Truth), line five:
*"With sincerity, it is as though there were no response (wú dá)."*
*"As though there were no response"*—this is the language binding one’s trust.
When one is in the central position, relying on sincerity to interact with others, and occupies a high station as the master of oaths, how could one abandon trust? Thus, *having naivety (fú)*—because one *has naivety*, one avoids blame.

The *Yan Yi* states: **"Trust is what can be repeated in speech."**
From the *Analects* (Book of Learning, First):
Master You said:
*"Trust is close to righteousness—speech can be repeated.*
*Reverence is close to ritual—it keeps one distant from shame and disgrace.*
*Thus, one does not lose one’s kin, and they can be revered as well."*

The *Yan Yi* states: **"Qi Huan did not betray Cao Gui—also called Cao Mò—at the Alliance."**
From the *Records of the Grand Historian*:
Cao Mò was a man of Lu.
He served Duke Zhuang of Lu through his strength and courage.
Duke Zhuang favored martial prowess, and Cao Mò became Lu’s general.
He fought against Qi three times and was defeated each time.
Duke Zhuang, fearful, offered the territory of Suì to make peace.
Yet he still kept Cao Mò as general.
Qi Huan Gong agreed to meet with Duke Zhuang at Kē and take the oath.
After the two dukes had sworn on the altar,
Cao Mò seized a dagger and held Qi Huan Gong hostage.
None of Qi Huan Gong’s attendants dared move.
He asked: *"What do you intend?"*
Cao Mò replied:
*"Qi is strong, Lu is weak, and the great state has already aggressed against Lu severely. Now Lu’s walls are ruined, pressing against Qi’s borders—you must consider this!"*
Qi Huan Gong then agreed to return all the lands he had seized from Lu.
After speaking, Cao Mò cast his dagger aside, descended from the altar, and knelt facing north among the assembled ministers, his expression unchanged, his words as before.
Qi Huan Gong, enraged, wished to break his oath.
Guan Zhong said: *"That cannot be done."*

The **Way** is abandoned when greed for petty gains leads one to abandon trust among the **lords of the states** and lose the support of the world—better to yield than to persist.

Thus, Qi Huan Gong finally ceded the lands he had seized from Lu.
All the territories lost by Cao Mò in three battles were restored to Lu.

*Extended Meaning*: The people of Jin did not abandon the promise to attack Yuan.
*Recorded*: The Jin army attacked Yuan.
Duke Wen of Wei led his soldiers to attack Yuan.
The Jin lord besieged Yuan, ordering three days’ worth of provisions. When Yuan refused to surrender, he ordered his troops to withdraw.
A spy reported: *"Yuan is about to surrender."*
The military officers said: *"Let us await it."*
The duke replied: *"Trust is the treasure of a state, the shelter of its people. To gain Yuan but lose trust—how could we shelter them?*
The more we lose, the greater the harm. Withdraw one step, and Yuan will surrender itself."
From then on, the **lords of the states** submitted in allegiance, just as they had to the promise to attack Yuan.

*Extended Meaning*: Wu Qi did not renege on the reward for moving the chariot axle.
*Recorded* from *The Historical Records*: Wu Qi, a general of Wei, sought to attack Qin but feared the soldiers and troops would not trust him. He buried a chariot axle at the eastern market gate.
He posted: *"If anyone can move this axle to the western gate, I will grant them land, fields, and a residence of one hundred *mu* and one hundred *jin* of gold."*
After three days, no one dared to move it.
He revised the posting: *"If anyone can move it, I will grant them land, fields, and a residence of five hundred *mu* and one hundred *jin* of gold."*
At that time, a man came forward and moved it, so he was rewarded accordingly.
Thus, he summoned recruits to attack Qin and succeeded.
This was a case where he did not renege on the reward for moving the axle.

*Extended Meaning*: The Marquis of Wei did not violate the hunter’s appointment.
*Recorded* from *The Historical Records*: The Marquis of Wei was Wei Wen Hou.
The hunter was an official overseeing mountains and marshes.
Wen Hou had made an appointment with the hunter for a hunt, but the next day, as he was about to depart, he happened to be enjoying wine and music with his ministers, when a heavy rain fell. He ordered his carriage to proceed to the wilds.
His attendants said: *"Today we are drinking and enjoying ourselves, and now it rains—where shall we find shelter?"*
Wen Hou said: *"I do not rest upon beasts and birds. I have made an appointment with the hunter—how could I fail to meet him? I fear losing trust, so I will go despite the rain."*

**The Great Dao Abandoned, Virtue/Power Emerges** (Chapter XVIII)
When the **Great Dao** is abandoned, there arise **virtue/power** and righteousness.

*Extended Meaning*: Zhuangzi said: *"Fish forget each other in the water; men forget each other in the arts of the **Way**."*
*Recorded* from *The Zhuangzi* (□ *Great Master [Da Zong Shi]*) states: *"When the spring dries up, fish share the land together. They breathe upon one another to keep moist, and splash water upon one another to keep wet—this is not as good as forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes."*

When wisdom arises, great deceit follows.
*Extended Meaning*: Zhuangzi said: *"Discard petty wisdom, and great wisdom will shine forth."*
*Recorded* from *The Zhuangzi* (□ *External Things [Wai Wu]*) states: *"Discard petty wisdom, and great wisdom will shine forth."*
Pettiness is self-serving; great wisdom follows the natural course.

*Extended Meaning*: How difficult it is to indulge in petty cleverness!
*Recorded* from *The Analects* (□ *The Duke of Wei [Wei Ling Gong]*) (Chapter XV): The Master said: *"To dwell together all day without discussing **virtue/power**, and to delight in petty cleverness—how difficult it is!"*
Pettiness is the indulgence of private desires.
When words do not touch upon **virtue/power**, the heart grows reckless and extravagant.
When one delights in petty cleverness, the inclination toward reckless risk and fortune-seeking matures.
"*How difficult it is!"* means that such a person cannot attain **virtue/power**, and disaster will surely follow.

*Extended Meaning*: Zhuangzi said: *"The true nature of the horse lies in its grazing on grass, drinking water, and lifting its hoof to stand."*
The text from *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Horse’s Hoof [Ma Ti]*) has already been detailed in the **Meaning**, so it is not repeated here.

「Extended Meaning」:

In the age of **Dao**’s pristine origin, the people did not know what to do, nor where to go. They carried their food in their mouths while strolling in contentment, drumming their bellies as they wandered freely.

*Quoted*: In the time of **Hēxiū** (the Radiant Virtue), the people dwelled without knowing what to do, walked without knowing where to go, carried their food in their mouths while strolling in contentment, drumming their bellies as they wandered freely. The people could attain this state.

*Commentary*: *Zhī* (adapt). **Hēxiū**, an ancient sovereign. Also, one whose radiant **virtue/power** caused the people to rally to him—thus called **Hēxiū**. This refers to the **Flame Emperor** (Yán Dì).

It is said: To carry food in the mouth while frolicking, indistinguishable from an infant; to drum the belly while roaming, no different from a child.

**Extended Meaning**:
To bend and twist **ritual and music** to rectify the forms of the world,
To stretch and strain **benevolence and righteousness** to soothe the hearts of the world.

*Quoted from* *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Horse’s Hoof [Mǎ Tí]*).

*Commentary*: To fold, bend, and rotate in performing **ritual and music** to correct the body’s posture; to yearn and aspire to soothe the soul. Thus, they stand on tiptoe, proud of their knowledge, and engage in deceitful scheming, all vying for profit and gain—yet they know not when to stop. Alas, the excesses of the sages!

Among kin, discord arises, yet there is filial piety and kindness.
In a chaotic state, loyal ministers emerge.

**Extended Meaning**:
*The Classic of Rites* states: *"When the **Dao** prevails, one does not love only one’s own parents, nor cherish only one’s own children."*

*Quoted from* *The Classic of Rites* (□ *The Great Plan of Sacrifice [Lǐ Yùn]*):

*"When the **Dao** prevails, the world is held in common. The worthy and capable are selected, trust is cultivated, and harmony is fostered. Thus, one does not love only one’s own parents, nor cherish only one’s own children. The aged have a place to end their days, the strong have useful labor, the young have nurturing, and the widowed, orphaned, disabled, and infirm all receive sustenance."*

Again, citing filial piety and kindness.

*The Analects*: Duke Kāng of Zhōu asked: *"How can one govern the people so that they are respectful, loyal, and encouraged?"* The Master replied: *"Rule them with solemnity, and they will be respectful. Be filial and kind, and they will be loyal."* Filial to one’s parents, kind to the multitude.

*The Erya* states: *"To serve one’s parents well is called filial piety."*

**Extended Meaning**:
Ministers who gouge out eyes and split open hearts.

*Quoted from* *Records of the Grand Historian* (□ *The Annals of the Shang Dynasty [Yīn Běn Jì]*):

*"Zhòu Xīn (King Zhòu) was unrighteous, and the world called him **Jiè** (the Tyrant)."* **Jiè** refers to one who violates laws, destroys righteousness, and harms the good.

King **Jiè**’s debauchery knew no end. **Mǐzǐ** repeatedly admonished him but was ignored, so he fled with the Grand Music Master and the Minor Music Master. **Bǐ Gān**, the king’s son, said: *"As a subject, one cannot fail to contend to the death."* He then forcibly admonished **Jiè**.

**Jiè** raged: *"I have heard that sages have seven orifices in their hearts. Let us dissect **Bǐ Gān** to see!"*

*The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Thief and the Ruined Wall [Tóu Huàn]*) states:
*"**Bǐ Gān**’s heart was split open, **Wú Zǔ**’s eyes were gouged out—these were the calamities of loyalty."*

These are ministers who gouge eyes and split hearts, whose loyalty and righteous death only manifest when the ruler is corrupt. Hence, *"In a chaotic state, loyal ministers emerge."*

**Extended Meaning**:
**Gǔsōu** was obstinate, yet **Shùn** was called the Great Filial Son.

*Quoted from* *The Book of Documents* (□ *The Record of Yáo [Yáo Diǎn]*):

*"The blind father, the obstinate mother, the arrogant brother—yet he harmonized them all. With filial piety unceasing, he did not tolerate evil. This was the Great Filial Son."*

*The Mencius* (□ *The First Chapter of Wàn Zhāng [Wàn Zhāng Zhāng Jù Shàng]*):

*"The truly filial serve their parents with reverence all their lives. At fifty, I saw such filial piety in the Great **Shùn**."*

**Extended Meaning**:
**Zēng Zhì** was stern, yet **Zēng Shēn** was praised for nurturing.

*Quoted from* *The Mencius* (□ *The First Chapter of Lí Lóu [Lí Lóu Zhāng Jù Shàng]*):

*"When **Zēng Shēn** cared for **Zēng Zhì**, he always ensured there was wine and meat. When serving, he would ask who to give the leftovers to. If there were any remaining, he would say, ‘There is.’ Thus, **Zēng Shēn** could be said to nurture his **virtue/power**."*

To serve one’s parents as **Zēng Shēn** did—this is acceptable.

**Chapter XIX: Discarding the Sage, Abandoning Wisdom**

**Extended Meaning**:
Zhuangzi said: *"To strike down sagehood and wisdom, to release and unite thieves and robbers—then the world begins to flourish."*

*Quoted from* *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Winnowing Basket [Zhuàn Kuāng]*):

*"To strike down sagehood and wisdom."*

*Commentary*: *"Strike down"* means to criticize and reject. Now, to speak of striking down is also to denounce **ren and yì**, to abandon the sage and discard wisdom. To not value rare and difficult goods, thus releasing and pardoning thieves and robbers, without resorting to harsh punishments—then the world attains great peace.

**Extended Meaning**:
To abandon petty wisdom, then great wisdom becomes clear.

**Chapter XIX: Discarding the Sage, Abandoning Wisdom**

*Extended Meaning*:

*Quoted from* *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Winnowing Basket [Zhuàn Kuāng]*):

*"To strike down sagehood and wisdom."*

*Commentary*: *"Strike down"* means to criticize and reject. Now, to speak of striking down is also to denounce **ren** and **yì**, to abandon the sage and discard wisdom. To not value rare and difficult goods, thus releasing and pardoning thieves and robbers, without resorting to harsh punishments—then the world attains great peace.

*Extended Meaning*:
To abandon petty wisdom, then great wisdom becomes clear.

**Quoted from** *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Outer Things [Wài Wù]*):

*"Small wisdom is self-serving; great wisdom follows things."*

*Extended Meaning*:
Zhi’s disciples asked him: *"Does theft too have the Dao/Way?"*
He said: *"Where could there be a place without Dao/Way?"*

*Quoted from* *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Winnowing Basket [Zhuàn Kuāng]*)—*its meaning already fully covered above.*

*Extended Meaning*:
*The Zhuangzi* recounts: *"The Lord of Song dreamed at midnight of a man with unbound hair peering at his private chamber door and said..."*
*Quoted from* *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Outer Things [Wài Wù]*):

*"The Lord of Song dreamed at midnight of a man with unbound hair peering at his private chamber door."*

*Commentary by* **Chéng Fǎshī** (成法師): *"The ruler of the state of Song, whose posthumous title was 'Lord of Song,' was surnamed Jié (镒) and named Yuán (元), i.e., the Lord of Song, Yuán."* *"Á"* (阿) means "crooked," referring to the crooked room of the private chamber—its meaning already explained in the commentary on the *Wài Wù* section.* Absolute **ren** and discard **yì**, and the people return to filial piety and natural kindness.

*Extended Meaning*:
Mencius said: *"There has never been one who practiced **ren** and neglected his parents."*
*"There has never been one who practiced **yì** and put his lord after his own interests."*

*Quoted from* *Mencius* (□ *The Sententious Chapter of the Duke of Liang [Liáng Huì Wáng Zhāngjù Shàng]*). Mencius’ reply to the king.

---

**Annotations by [Author]**:
*"遗"* (yí) means "abandon," akin to *"橐"* (tuó, "to neglect").
*"后"* (hòu) means "to delay," or "not to prioritize."

The **Dao/Way** states that one who practices **ren** must love their parents, and one who upholds **yì** must serve their lord with urgency. When **ren** and **yì** are discarded, and clever artifices and material gains abandoned, thieves and bandits vanish.

**Extended Meaning**:
*"巧"* (qiǎo) means "artifice," referring to intricate carvings, mechanical devices, and locks like *"扃鐍"* (jiōng shū, "double bolt and lock").
Quoted from *Zhuangzi* (□ *The Chapter on Opening Coffers and Chests [Kōu Qìè]*):

*"Yet when great thieves arrive, they carry off the chest and the coffer, sling the bags over their shoulders and run away, fearing only that the cords and bolts may not be secure enough. They carve and shape every form yet do not consider it clever—like the craftsmen of the State of Wei who carve date monkeys, or those of the State of Song who polish mulberry leaves."*

*"琢"* (zhuó) means "to polish," as in refining jade or stone. *"既琢之而复磨之"* (jì zhuó zhī ér fù mó zhī) means "after polishing, they grind it again."
From *The Chapter on Heaven and Earth* (□ *Tiāndì Piān*):

*"The gardener angrily flushed and laughed, saying: 'I have heard from my teacher that one who uses artifices will always have artificial matters to attend to. One who attends to artificial matters will always have artificial thoughts. When artificial thoughts dwell in the heart, purity and wholeness are lost.'"*

**Extended Meaning**:
*"珠玉斗斛权衡符玺"* (zhū yù dǒu hú quán héng fú xǐ) refers to pearls, jade, measures of grain and liquid, scales, and royal seals.
Quoted from *Zhuangzi* (□ *The Chapter on Opening Coffers and Chests [Kōu Qìè]*):

*"They make measures of grain and liquid to gauge them—ten sheng make a dou, four dou and four sheng make an hu. Then they steal both the measures and the grain. They make scales and balance beams to weigh them—*权* (quán) being the weight, *衡* (héng) being the beam. Then they steal both the scales and the goods. They make royal seals and tally tokens to authenticate them—*符* (fú) being the copper fish and wooden contracts, *玺* (xǐ) being the jade seal of the sovereign. Then they steal both the seals and the goods."*

**The Chapter on Discarding Learning and Having No Worries [Jué Xué Wú Yōu]**, the Twenty-First:
Discarding learning and having no worries—how far apart is this from *"唯"* (wéi, "simply") and *"阿"* (ā, "crooked")?
How great is the difference between good and evil?

**Extended Meaning**:
*Zhuangzi*'s **"Dao/Way"** speaks of *"俗学"* (sú xué, "common learning")," seeking to restore one's original nature.
Quoted from *Zhuangzi* (□ *The Chapter on Cultivating the Nature [Shàn Xìng Wài Piān]*):

*"Annotation: One has already conformed to the ways of the world, yet wishes to use common learning to restore the original nature—thus, the more one seeks, the further one strays from the **Dao/Way**.**
What people fear, one must indeed fear.
Vast, its end is boundless!"*

**Extended Meaning**:
*The Classic of Poetry* (□ *Shī Jīng*) says: *"The night is endless,"* meaning the water clocks still have much time to run.
Quoted from *Mao Poetry* (□ *Mao Shī* □ *The Lesser Odes [Xiǎo Yā]* □ *Court Torches [Tíng Liáo]*):

*"A praise of King Xuan of Zhou. The night, how it lingers! The light of the court torches flickers—when a nobleman arrives, the sound of the *luán* (鸾, a musical instrument) resounds."*

**The Chapter on the Appearance of the Sage [Kōng Dé Zhī Róng]**, the Twenty-First:
The **Dao/Way** as a thing is but a dim and hazy perception—
Hazy and indistinct, yet within it lies an image.
Indistinct and dim, yet within it lies a substance.

**Extended Meaning**:
*Zhuangzi*'s *"真君"* (zhēn jūn, "True Sovereign") is what we now call *"性"* (xìng, "inherent nature").
Quoted from *Zhuangzi* (□ *The Chapter on Equalizing Things [Qí Wù Piān]*):

*"If this is so, then do all things have ministers and servants?
Are their ministers and servants inadequate to govern them?
Do they alternate as ministers and servants?
Or is there a True Sovereign within them?
Whether one finds its essence or not, it does no harm or benefit to its True Sovereign.
This means that those who attain the True Nature act according to its own **Dao/Way**—even as a lowly laborer, they remain unshaken by praise or blame, content in their own work. Thus, the knowing and the unknowing are all the same.*

*Deep and mysterious, yet within it lies essence.
Its essence is most true, yet within it lies faith."*

**Extended Meaning**:
*"犹乌足之根为跻增"* (yóu wū zú zhī gēn wéi jī zēng) is like the roots of the *wūzú* (乌足, "grass with hoof-like leaves") becoming *jīzēng* (跻增, "a kind of plant").
*"人血之为野火"* (rén xuè zhī wéi yě huǒ) is human blood becoming *"wildfire"* (野火, "a spontaneous combustion phenomenon").
*"朽瓜之为鱼"* (xiǔ guā zhī wéi yú) is a rotten gourd becoming *"fish"* (鱼, "a parasitic beetle in gourds").
*"贤女之为石"* (xián nǚ zhī wéi shí) is a virtuous woman becoming *"stone"* (石, "a fossilized human shape").

Quoted from *Liezi* (□ *The Chapter on Heaven’s Bounties and Earth’s Treasures [Tiān Ruì Piān]*):

*"Annotation: The transformations of life and death—how can one measure them?
What is born here may die there; what dies there may be born here.
The changes of **qi** (炁) adapt to myriad forms—all these are natural responses to what they sense."*

From *The Book of Transformation* (□ *Huà Shū*):

*"乌足"* (wūzú) is the name of a grass.
*Zhèng Shì* (郑氏) annotated *Er Yǎ* (尔雅), saying: *"It grows in woodlands; commonly called *yì* (蜴, "lizard"), yet its appearance varies by region."*

**Extended Meaning**:
*"During the reign of Emperor Hui of Jin, Zhang Hua served as the Minister of Works—his deeds are well-documented and need not be repeated."*

**Chapter Twenty-Two: "The Fullness of the Bent" (曲则全章)**

*"The bent remains whole; the twisted becomes straight.
The hollow becomes full; the worn becomes new.
The small attains; the excessive confuses.
Extended Meaning: This is as seen in Lín Xiàngrú’s yielding to Lián Pó."*

**Annotation:**
Lián Pó and Lín Xiàngrú both served in the state of Zhào. Pó held a lower rank than Xiàngrú, and in anger he declared: *"I have rendered great service to the state, yet I am placed beneath Xiàngrú—this is a shame I cannot bear. When I encounter him on the road, I shall humiliate him."* Xiàngrú, hearing this, always avoided him by turning his carriage aside. His attendants were puzzled and asked: *"Why does the Prime Minister not fear the mighty Qin, yet fear Lián Pó?"* Xiàngrú replied: *"Qin does not dare to lightly attack Zhào because it fears me and General Pó. If I were to meet General Pó, two tigers would fight, and neither could survive—this would endanger Zhào and benefit Qin. I avoid him only to preserve the state. How could I act from private resentment?"* When Pó heard this, he stripped bare, bore a bundle of thorns, and apologized. This shows how one who fears must refine himself, and how straight virtue can correct the bent.

**Extended Meaning:** *"There are those who, though talented, fragment their virtue."*

**Annotation from *Zhuāngzǐ* (人间世):**
*"Zhīlí Cū"* was a man whose jawbone was hidden beneath his navel, whose shoulders rose above his neck, and who could point to the sky by grasping his hair. He could mend needles and weave mats to sustain himself. When beating a drum and playing the *shí* (a divination instrument), he could feed ten men. When summoned for military service, he would roll up his sleeves and stand among the soldiers. When the state demanded labor, he would feign illness to avoid work. When the state gave grain to the sick, he would accept three *zhòng* (a measure) of six *shǐ* (a smaller measure) and four *dòu* (a still smaller measure), along with ten bundles of firewood. Though his body was deformed, he could still nourish himself and live out his natural span. But one who fragments his virtue—his talents go unexalted, his name unsung. If a man understands this and cultivates himself, how could he not preserve his enduring reputation?

**Extended Meaning:** *"The *Yì* says: 'Simple and unadorned, yet all under heaven’s principles are attained.'"*
**Annotation from *Yìjīng* (系辞上):**
*"Simple and unadorned, yet all under heaven’s principles are attained."* **Commentary:** *"No principle under heaven does not arise from simplicity, nor do all things in the world achieve their proper order without it."*

**Extended Meaning:** *"Zhuāngzǐ said: 'When knowledge fails to settle the world, then adorn it with words, augment it with learning. But when words overshadow substance, and learning drowns the mind...'"* **Annotation from *Zhuāngzǐ* (缮性篇):**
*"Knowledge cannot settle the world, so one adds words and learning to it. When words overshadow substance, and learning drowns the mind..."* **Exegesis:** *"Though one studies widely to benefit the world, if they do not recognize that substance is the root of words, then ornamentation will obscure the plain. If they do not see that learning is but the fringe of the mind, then excessive study will drown its essence. Only by abandoning learning and discarding words can one attain the beauty of non-action."*

**Extended Meaning:** *"Lièzǐ said: 'The scholar perishes through multiplicity.'"*
**Annotation from *Lièzǐ* (说符篇):**
*"Xīn Dūzǐ said: 'The Great Way loses its way through branching paths, and the scholar perishes through multiplicity.'"*
**Lu’s Commentary:** *"The sheep is a metaphor for the spirit. If one guards the spirit without loss, this is the Way. But once the sheep is lost in wandering paths, it cannot be recovered. Only by guarding the spirit—neither losing nor gaining—does one attain non-dependence. The same applies to excessive adherence to benevolence and righteousness."*

**Extended Meaning:** *"Gēngsāngzǐ said: 'If ten thousand men each draw their bows to shoot at a single hawk, the hawk cannot escape being struck.'"*
**Annotation from *Lièzǐ* (清神第一):**
*"How can one sorrow or rejoice in turn without disturbing the true nature? Much less can the myriad things, in their multitude, uplift and agitate the heart and spirit! Thus, if ten thousand men bend their bows toward a single hawk, how could the hawk escape being struck? This speaks of the hawk as a cunning bird, and all men turn their arrows upon it. It is a metaphor for the heart’s myriad distractions—when emotions surge and the mind is tossed, it is like that hawk pierced by stillness. When the myriad things dazzle and confuse, how could life remain unharmed?"*

**Extended Meaning:** *"Only water approaches the Way: flowing east or west, yet nothing can harm it."*

**Annotation from *Mèngzǐ* (告子章句上):**
*"Gào Zǐ said: 'Human nature is like a rushing stream—if released toward the east, it flows east; if released toward the west, it flows west.'"*
*"This speaks of water’s nature: it follows downward, benefits all things without contention, and thus nothing harms it. Therefore, the sage embraces unity as the model for all under heaven. Not seeing himself, he becomes bright. Not asserting himself, he becomes manifest. Not boasting of himself, he achieves deeds. Not vaunting himself, he endures."*

**Extended Meaning:** *"Yú Shùn had four eyes."*

**Annotation from *Shàngshū* (舜典):**
*"On the first day of the first month, Shùn paid homage at the ancestral temple, consulted the Four Yù (regional officials), opened the four gates, and illuminated the four senses. [Commentary:] 'Consulted' means 'planned.' 'Opened' means 'unlocked.' After Shùn ascended the throne and reported to the ancestral temple, he sought governance from the Four Yù, opened the gates of the four directions to attract the worthy of all under heaven, and expanded the sight and hearing of the four quarters to resolve the obstructions of the world."*

**Extended Meaning:** *"The *Huáinánzǐ* records: When Zhào Jiǎnzǐ died and had not yet been buried, Zhòngmò refused to assist in the funeral rites. Zhào Shuāngzǐ raised an army to attack them."*
**Annotation:** *"This is already detailed in the *Huáinánzǐ*; no need to repeat it."*

**Chapter Twenty-Three: "Speak Seldom and Return to Nature" (希言自然章)**

*"Speak seldom and return to nature—
the gusting wind does not last a morning,
the sudden rain does not last a day."*

**Extended Meaning:** *"'Hī' means sparse, few. The *Yì* says: 'The words of the virtuous are few; the words of the hasty are many.'"*
**Annotation from *Yìjīng* (系辞).*

The one who would rebel, his words are ashamed;
the one whose heart is doubtful, his words are disjointed.
The virtuous speak sparingly, the hasty speak much.
Those who slander the good, their words are wandering;
those who lose their steadfastness, their words are twisted.
These six kinds of speech—only the virtuous speak sparingly,
thus proving the meaning of *"Speak Seldom and Return to Nature."*

Who does this for? The heavens and the earth.
The heavens and the earth cannot endure long,
how much less can mortals?

**Extended Meaning:** *"Man dwells between heaven and earth—
is he not like a speck of dust upon a horse’s body?"*
(Quoted from *Zhuāngzǐ*, *"Autumn Waters"* chapter)

This comparison to all things—
is he not like a speck of dust upon a horse’s body?
Great and small each have their ranks,
unable to surpass one another—
how could they be worthy of concern?

Those who align with the Dao, the Dao responds to them.
Those who align with virtue, virtue responds to them.
Those who align with loss, loss responds to them.
If trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.

**Extended Meaning:** *"Men gather by their kind—
thus, when the tiger roars, the wind rises."*
(Quoted from *Yì*, *"Qián"* Nine-Five: *"Clouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger."*)
The dragon is a water creature, clouds are water vapor—
when the dragon hums, mist arises: this is clouds following the dragon.
The tiger is a fierce beast, wind is a stirring force—
when the tiger roars, valley winds arise: this is wind following the tiger.
Emotion from the sentient affecting the insentient—
this clearly shows that like qi responds to like qi.

**Extended Meaning:** *"The crane’s cry, its chick answers."*
(Quoted from *Yì*, *"Upper Sequence"*:
*"The crane cries in the shade, its chick answers it.
I have a fine goblet—let me share it with you."*)
**Commentary:** *"The crane cries in a secluded place,
yet its chick, though distant, answers it—
because they share the same kind and respond to one another.
'I have a fine goblet'—this means I possess a noble virtue,
not keeping it to myself.
'Let me share it with you'—
if I scatter it outward, things will also sense my benevolence
and come to follow me."*

**Extended Meaning:** *"If natures differ, then the liver and gall differ—
the distinction of inherent traits.
If the Dao aligns, then the Yi and Xia become one people—
by kind gathering, nothing resists.
Like the *fāngzhū* drawing moonlight to flow water."*

**Extended Meaning:** *"The *fāngzhū* shell—
between the Eastern Sea and Fángzhū, there is a giant clam.
Its length is two *cùn* more than a *chǐ*—
thus it is named *fāngzhū*.
Taking its shell, soft and white, and polishing it for a long time,
then holding it beneath the moon and catching the dew,
water is obtained."*

**Extended Meaning:** *"The *yángyù* draws sunlight to ignite fire."*
*The yángyù*—a bronze vessel shaped like a cup or mirror.
Polishing it with black silk, holding it to the sun,
and placing millet beneath it, fire is obtained.
These two things—*fāngzhū* and *yángyù*—
use the light of sun and moon,
and through like qi responding to like qi,
water and fire are produced.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Four: "The Unsteady Cannot Stand" (跂者不立章)**
The unsteady cannot stand;
the overreaching cannot walk.

**Extended Meaning:**
*"The **unsteady** lifts the heel and gazes forward.
The **overreaching** grasps things with outstretched limbs.
[Annotation: *Tang* Dù Tiānshī’s commentary states:] ‘To walk on the toes with greasy feet is called **unsteady**.
To stretch out and hope for lasting progress is difficult indeed.
Straining neck and lifting heel—
these are the words of Chén Hòu’s *Longmén Fu* [Lament of the Long Gate], expressing longing for favor.
To grasp at things while seeking to walk far is also unattainable.
This illustrates how one who cannot sincerely commit,
doubts the Dao/Way, and with fleeting resolve,
hopes for swift success—how difficult that is!’

**Extended Meaning:**
‘Have you not heard of the youth from Shòuling who went to study walking in Hándān,
but failed to master the art of that land,
and even lost his original way,
so that he crawled back home on all fours?’
[Annotation: From *Zhuāngzi*’s *Qiūshuǐ* [Autumn Water].]
Xīhuá Fǎshī’s commentary:
‘Shòuling was a city of Yān [Yan].
Hándān was a commandery of Zhào [Zhao].
A youth in his weak years, before full strength—
this is the **Shòuling youth**.
The people of Zhào’s commandery were skilled in walking.
Thus, a young man from Yan traveled far to learn the gait,
but his efforts only distorted his nature,
and he failed to acquire Zhào’s skill.
Abandoning his own way to imitate others,
he lost his original manner of Shòuling,
so he used his hands to push himself along,
crawling back in defeat.’

‘Those who see only themselves remain obscure;
those who insist on their own way are not illustrious;
those who praise themselves achieve no merit;
those who boast of themselves grow not long.’

**Extended Meaning:**
‘Yángzǐ, styled **Zǐjū**, dwelt in the south at Péi,
and encountered Lǎozǐ in Liáng.
Lǎozǐ, halting mid-Dao, gazed heavenward and sighed:
*“Once you might have been taught,
but now you cannot be.”*
For his arrogance had only increased since before.
Yángzǐ humbly asked what his fault was.
Lǎozǐ replied:
*“Your strides are **sleep-sleep**,
your posture is **wān-wān**,
and with whom do you dwell?”*
[Annotation: From *Lièzǐ*’s *Huángdì Piān* [Huangdi Chapter].]
Yángzǐ’s gait was **sleep-sleep**—
inverted, not flowing;
**wān-wān**—
dry, not upright.
It seemed he inwardly saw his own failure,
yet outwardly feigned a show of effort.

**Extended Meaning:**
‘Like the frog of a shallow well,
[it] told the **turtle of the Eastern Sea**:
*“I find joy here!
When I leap, I reach the brink of the well’s rim;
when I rest, I nestle in the hollow of the broken tiles.
Dive into water, and I touch the armpits and chin;
plunge into mud, and I sink to the ankles, obliterating my tracks.
I command the water of a single ditch,
and with my **clambering** and **crawling**,
enjoy the pleasures of the shallow well—
this is the utmost delight!
Why do you not often come to visit?”*
The turtle of the Eastern Sea had not yet entered with its left foot,
when its right **claw** was already bound and constrained.
Thus, it journeyed far to the sea and declared:
*“The frog of the shallow well,
when it hears my words,
stares in shock and loses its composure—
it is utterly lost!
Is this not the case of one who insists on his own way and remains obscure?”*
[Annotation: From *Zhuāngzi*’s *Qiūshuǐ* [Autumn Water].]

The **Master Xīhuà** expounded:

*"The shallow well*—that is, the shallow pit—*the frog*, which is the toad. *Dry*—the well’s railing. *Tiles*—the stacked bricks within the well. *Ankles*—the foot’s instep. *Armpits*—the underarm. *Chin*—the lower jaw.

As for the turtle of the Eastern Sea, its form is vast and grand; it rides the waves and plays at will, occasionally dwelling upon the land. Yet the toad, a mere small creature, resides in a narrow well, its physique and dwelling both meager. It finds contentment within its pit, and though it sees the great turtle, it feels no fear. It declares:

*'When I emerge, I leap upon the well’s railing;
when I retreat, I rest upon the broken tiles’ edge.
Swimming, I touch my armpits and chin;
plunging into mud, I vanish my insteps and sink to my ankles.
Gazing upon the shrimp and crab,
and peering down at the insects and beetles,
I wander freely and revel in joy—
none surpasses my delight!*

*Further elaboration states:* *One who boasts of himself*—like the man from Zhèng who lamented the Kòu family’s land, yet in three years became a Confucian scholar, and whose influence spread nine *lǐ* along the river, benefiting three generations—*his parents, his wife...*

The text from *Zhuangzi*—**《列御寇》**—has been transcribed in full and need not be repeated again.

**Commentary:**
*"Verse"* (呻吟) refers to recitation. *Jiū Shì* (裘氏) is a place name. *Zhǐ* (祇) means "just" or "exactly." The man from Zhèng, named *Huǎn*, studied in Jiū land, and in exactly three years became a Confucian scholar. Engaging in debates with Daoists, Mohists, and Confucians, his father aided Zhì, yet within ten years, Huǎn took his own life. Truly, is this not proof that those who boast of themselves reap no fruit?

**Extended Meaning:**
Those who pride themselves—like the Jin historian *Qí Wáng Tóng*, who raised an army to attack Zhao Wang Lún—are detailed elsewhere and need not be repeated here.

To indulge in excess beyond one’s nature is to overflow.

From *Zhuangzi*—**《骈拇》**—it is said:
*"Twisted toes and extra fingers—are these not born of nature? Yet to indulge in deformity, to cling like a parasitic growth or a pendulous wart—these too are born of form, yet to indulge in excess beyond nature."*

**Chapter Twenty-Five: *The Undifferentiated Whole***
There exists an undifferentiated whole that arose before Heaven and Earth.

**Extended Meaning:**
Zhuangzi said:
*"The Dao precedes the Supreme Ultimate yet is not exalted;
it lies beneath the Six Extremes yet is not profound;
it arises before Heaven and Earth yet is not enduring;
it endures beyond the ancient past yet is not aged."*

From *Zhuangzi*—**《大宗师》**—it is said:
*"The Dao precedes the Supreme Ultimate yet is not exalted;
it lies beneath the Six Extremes yet is not profound;
it arises before Heaven and Earth yet is not enduring;
it endures beyond the ancient past yet is not aged."*

**Commentary:**
The *Supreme Ultimate* (太极) refers to the Five Qi (五气).
The *Six Extremes* (六极) are the Six Directions (六合).
Yet the Dao, above the Five Qi, is not distant;
beneath the Six Directions, it is not abyssal;
before Heaven and Earth, it is not eternal;
enduring beyond the ancient past, it is not aged.
It is said that the Dao is neither high nor deep, neither long nor old—
thus, the Dao is everywhere, yet in all places, it is nowhere.

**Extended Meaning:**
This is what the *Yijing*—**《系辞》**—refers to as the *Supreme Ultimate*.
It is said:
*"Thus, the *Yijing* has the Supreme Ultimate,
which generates the Two Complements,
the Two Complements generate the Four Symbols,
the Four Symbols generate the Eight Trigrams."*

**Annotation:**
*"What exists must begin with the nonexistent,
thus the Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Complements.
The Supreme Ultimate is the nameless name—
yet it can be named, taking its extreme from what has,
thus it is called the Supreme Ultimate."*

The Four Symbols are Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire.
Silent and boundless, it stands alone yet never changes,
circulates endlessly yet never falters—
it can be the Mother of all under Heaven.

**Extended Meaning:**
Even form and shadow depend on each other,
yet this is called *self-so* (独化).

From *Zhuangzi*—**《齐物论》**—it is said:
*"Wángliǎng asked his shadow:
'Just now, you walked; now you stand.
Just now, you sat; now you rise.
Why do you lack consistency?'

The shadow replied:
'Do I depend on something to be thus?
What I depend on also depends on something to be thus.
Do I depend on the serpent’s scales or the cicada’s wings?
How would I know why it is so?
How would I know why it is not?'

Guó Xiāng’s annotation says:
'If it depended on the serpent’s scales or the cicada’s wings,
then the reason for its lack of consistency would not be difficult to discern.
But since it does not depend on such things and yet transforms alone,
this is why it is said.'

Thus, the extended meaning takes this to illustrate
that which stands alone yet never changes.

**Extended Meaning:**
When gathered, it is the essence of pure substance,
hidden within millet grains.

**Annotation:**
*"Millet grains"* are the words from *The Scripture on Nourishing Life* (*Dù Rén Jīng*).
Xué Yōuxī’s annotation says:
*"Millet grains are the first of the five grains.
Rice is the foundation of human life—
thus, the saying that one who attains the Dao
has the resources of the Way spread throughout the cosmos,
yet even in its smallest form, it is hidden within millet grains.
This illustrates that the Dao encompasses all without burdening existence—
how then could there be any danger or peril?
Thus it is said: it circulates endlessly yet never falters.

**Extended Meaning:**
It flows through the Six Void Directions,
its applications inexhaustible.

From the *Yijing*—**《下系辞》**—it is said:
*"The *Yijing* as a book cannot be distant;
the Way it describes is ever-shifting.
It does not remain fixed, flowing through the Six Void Directions,
above and below without constancy,
the strong and weak transforming—
it cannot be codified as a fixed standard,
only adapting to change.
This is how the great Dao, as the One Qi,
circulates through the six lines,
extending throughout Heaven and Earth,
in all four directions, above and below—
its applications are inexhaustible,
thus it is said: it circulates endlessly yet never falters."*

I do not know its name—
I call it *Dao*.
If I must name it, I call it *Great*.
Great is *Passing*;
Passing is *Distant*;
Distant is *Returning*.

**Extended Meaning:**
*"Name"* (名) refers to its *virtue/power*;
*"Character"* (字) refers to its *essence*.
From *Du Tian Shi’s* *Broad Explication of Sacred Meaning* (*Guang Shèng Yì*) it is said:
*"To name a thing is to define its essence;
to characterize a thing is to define its virtue/power.
When a thing is born, its name is established—
this is the norm.
There has never been a thing without a name."*

In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Huan of Lu, sixth year, ninth month, *Dingmǎo*, Prince Zǐtóng was born.
The Duke asked Shēn Rú for a name.
Shēn Rú replied:
*"Names have five categories:
*Trustworthy* (信), *Virtuous* (义), *Symbolic* (象), *Borrowed* (假), and *Resemblance* (类).
To name based on birth is trustworthy—
like Táng Chú Yú or Lǔ Gōngzǐ Yǒu.
To name based on virtue is virtuous—
like Wén Wáng Chāng or Wǔ Wáng Fā.
To name based on resemblance is symbolic—
like Kǒngzǐ’s *Xiàng* (象) and *Níqiú Shān* (尼丘山).
To borrow from things is borrowed—
like Bó Yú’s birth, when someone presented fish,
so he was named *Lǐ* (鲤, ‘carp’).
To take from the father is resemblance—
like Zǐtóng’s birth, born on the same day as his father."*

**Extended Meaning:**
Before Heaven and Earth arose, it is difficult to speak of its lineage.

**Annotation:**
*"Lineage"* (氏族) is from the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Huan’s eighth year, winter—
Prince Wúhài died, and Prince Yǔfù’s father requested a posthumous title from the clan.
The Duke asked Zhòng Zhōng about the clan.
Zhòng Zhōng replied:
*"The Son of Heaven establishes virtue,
grants a surname based on birth,
and bestows a clan name with land,
thus naming the lineage."*

The feudal lords took their ancestral fathers’ posthumous titles as surnames, and from these surnames came the clans. If an official had meritorious service passed down through generations, then there were official clans—meaning they took the old offices and old domains as their clans.

Domains were also so named. The Duke bestowed the posthumous title *Zhǎn* (展) as a surname. Prince Wúhài (无骇) was the grandson of the Duke of Zhǎn (展), hence he was of the Zhǎn clan.

Thus, the Dao is vast, Heaven is vast, Earth is vast, and the King is also vast. Within the realm, there are four vast things, and the King occupies one of them.

**Extended Meaning:**
Under all Heaven, there is nothing that is not the King’s land.
Within the borders of the land, there is nothing that is not the King’s subjects.

*(Quoted from the *Mèngzǐ’s* "Wànchāng [上]" chapter.)*

Xiánqiū Méng (咸丘蒙) said: “Mèngzǐ was a disciple of the Master.” When Shùn (舜) did not serve Yáo (尧), he had already received the Mandate.

The *Shījīng* (Book of Songs) states: *“Běiyǎn”* (北山) from the *Xiǎoyǎ* (小雅), saying:
Under all Heaven, there is nothing that is not the King’s land.
Within the borders of the land, there is nothing that not the King’s subjects.

*(普, pǔ, means "all-pervasive"; 率, shuài, means "to follow in order.")*

**Extended Meaning:**
From Earth upward, all things belong to Heaven.

*(Quoted from: "Things on Earth belonging to Heaven." From the *Lièzǐ’s* "Tiānruì [篇]" chapter.)*

There was a man from Qǐguó (杞国) who worried that Heaven and Earth would collapse and fall, leaving him nowhere to rest his body, and so he neglected his sleep and food.

There was also someone who worried about his worry, and so went to enlighten him, saying:
“Heaven is but accumulated *qi* (炁), where there is no place where *qi* does not exist.
Like bending and stretching, inhaling and exhaling, one moves within Heaven all day.
Why should you worry about its collapse?”

If we examine this passage, its words are broad and its meaning profound, and it cannot be exhaustively cited.

But according to the theory of Heaven as accumulated *qi*, since it says one moves within Heaven all day,
then it is known that from Earth upward, all things belong to Heaven.

Thus it is said: *“Not necessarily lofty and distant, but vast and boundless.”*
Again, the *Zhuāngzǐ’s* “Xiāoyáo Yóu” (逍遥游) chapter states:
“Heaven’s vastness, vastness—
is it its true color?
Its boundlessness, without end?
Its gaze upon the world below—
is it also like this.”

People follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows Nature.

**Extended Meaning:**
People refers to the King.
The King follows Earth’s tranquility, hence without action, the world’s affairs are accomplished.

*(Quoted from the *Zhuāngzǐ’s* "Tiāndào [篇]" chapter.)*
It says:
“Heaven does not give birth, yet all things transform;
Earth does not grow, yet all things nurture;
the Sovereign does nothing, yet the world’s affairs are accomplished.”

*(Commentary states: The King, like Heaven and Earth, contains and nurtures all things,
follows the four seasons to cultivate life,
allows all things to act naturally,
thus the world’s affairs are accomplished.)*

End of the *Sixth Scroll* of the *Mìngjìng* (Mingjing) *Hand Mìngjìng* (Hand Quotations).
End of the *Seventh Scroll* of the *Mìngjìng* (Mingjing) *Hand Quotations*.

**Five-Peak Daoist Master Rǔ Guózhèng’s *Qīng’ān Yìshì* Collection**
**Scroll Twenty-Six: "Heavy as the Root, Light as the Sovereign"**

Heavy as the root, light as the sovereign.
**Extended Meaning:**
When dragons and serpents coil in deep repose and stillness,
then their transformations rise and ascend.
When tigers and leopards rage with wild agitation,
they are met by arrows and hunted, their lives cut short.

*(Quoted from the *Xìazì’s* "Lower Appendices" [下系辞] chapter.)*
It says:
"The inchworm’s bending is to seek sincerity.
The dragon-serpent’s repose is to preserve its life."

*(Commentary states:)*
The inchworm’s bending at the start is stillness,
for it seeks the trust of what follows behind.
Sincerity requires bending,
and bending is to seek sincerity—
this is mutual necessity.

The dragon-serpent’s repose is to preserve its life,
meaning stillness seeks movement.
At first, the dragon-serpent lies in repose—
this is stillness.
Through this, it preserves its life,
and thus its transformations soar and ascend.

*(Quoted from the *Zhuāngzǐ’s* "Gēngsāng Chǔ [篇].")*
Gēngsāngzǐ said:
"My surname is Gēngsāng, my given name is Chǔ.
I am a disciple of Lǎojūn."

A young scholar came and asked:
"Sir, the beast of the *hànchē* [函车]—
its body is as large as a chariot.
If it stands alone and departs from the mountains,
it cannot escape the nets and traps."

This beast is very large,
its mouth able to contain a chariot.
Standing alone and leaving the mountains,
it cannot escape the snares—
this is its peril.

Thus, the true sage moves through life daily,
never abandoning his baggage.
Though he may enjoy grandeur and splendor,
he rests in serene detachment.

**Extended Meaning:**
Grandeur, like that of Nánhóng,
is swift in its movement—
yet still, one cannot abandon his baggage.

*(Quoted from the *Zhuāngzǐ’s* "Gēngsāng Chǔ [篇].")*
Nánhóng, upright and seated, said:
"If I were to live as long as the *Yuè* people,
where would I place my legacy to reach this point?"

Gēngsāngzǐ replied:
"Now, my abilities are small,
insufficient to transform you.
Why not journey south to see Lǎojūn?"

Nánhóng, weak from hunger and travel,
reached Lǎojūn in seven days and seven nights.
This shows that seeking learning is swift,
yet even so, he endured seven days of provisions.
Though he had grandeur and splendor,
how could he abandon his baggage?

Yet how can the ruler of a *wànshèng* [万乘] realm
be light in his governance of the world?
Lightness leads to losing his ministers,
agitation leads to losing his throne.

**Extended Meaning:**
The ruler holds the honored position of *wànshèng* [万乘],
sits upon the grandest treasure of the realm.

*(Quoted from the *Mèngzǐ’s* "Discourse on King Liáng Huìwáng [梁惠王章句上].")*
It says:
"A realm of *wànshèng* [万乘]."
*(Annotation: "Shèng" refers to the number of chariots.)*
A realm of *wànshèng* [万乘]—
the Son of Heaven’s domain within the thousand-li boundary,
where chariots number ten thousand.

*(Quoted from the *Xìazì’s* "Lower Appendices" [下系辞] chapter.)*
It says:
"The Sage’s greatest treasure is called *wèi* [位]."
How does one uphold *wèi* [position]?
By *rén* [benevolence].
How does one gather the people?
By *cái* [wealth]."
*(Justification states:)*
The Sage’s greatest treasure is *wèi* [position].
*Wèi* is the land of a realm,
a treasure is a useful thing.
If one resides in a grand position,
able to widely benefit without bounds,
then it is called the greatest treasure.

**Extended Meaning:**
He who sits in such a position
will invite exile and ruin,
and cannot serve his lord.

*(Quoted from the *Shàngshū’s* "Ballad of Shùn [舜典].")*
It says:
"To banish and exile him far away."

Gōnggōng in Yōuzhōu,
a worthless son of Shàohào,
whom the world called *Qiōngqí*—
this was Gōnggōng himself.
He served as Emperor Yáo’s Water Officer.
Yōuzhōu lay in the north,
the land of Yōu Commandery—
as Zhuāngzi spoke of *Yōudū*.
*"Fàngfàng"* means to place and confine,
to be confined with nowhere else to go.

Gǔndòu at Chóngshān,
a worthless son of the ancient Jiū Emperor,
whom the world called *Hùntún*—
this was Gǔndòu himself.
He conspired with Gōnggōng in the southern marches.
*"Cuàncuàn"* means to exile and imprison.

The Sānmiáo at Sān Yuè,
a worthless son of the Zhěn Yún clan,
whom the world called *Tāotiè*—
he was a vassal of Yáo.
Their realm was sealed in the west,
its borders stretching from the left of Lake Dongting
to the right of Lake Poyang, near Yùzhōu,
close to the southern Nányuè Mountains.
Sān Yuè was a mountain name,
located in the western marches—
the land of the Xi Qiáng in Qín Commandery.
*"Zhìjí"* means to detain, confine, and torment.

Gǔn at Yǔshān.
Gǔn was the father of King Yǔ.
He failed to tame the floods.
All four men harbored wickedness,
defying Yáo’s transformation.
Thus, they were banished to the four marches.

**Extended Meaning:**
*"If a ruler is not discreet, he loses his ministers;
if a minister is not discreet, he loses his life."*
*(Quoted from the *Yì’s* "Systematic Commentary" [系辞]:)*
*"If a ruler is not discreet, he loses his ministers;
if a minister is not discreet, he loses his life.
If minor matters are not handled discreetly, ruin follows—
thus, the sage is cautious, speaking little."*

*"Minor matters"* refers to subtle affairs
requiring careful discretion to prevent disaster.
If indiscretion leads to leaks,
calamity ensues—
hence, *"ruin follows."*

**Extended Meaning:**
From the *Zuǒzhuan*, *Xuān Gōng* Year 9:
*"Duke Xuān of Chén conspired with Kǒng Níng and Yí Xíngfù
over Xià Jī."*

*(Note: Meaning already detailed; no repetition.)*

**Extended Meaning:**
*"Hán Xīn’s defeat of Qí."*
*(Note: Meaning already complete; no further recording.)*

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Virtue of the Good Way**

The good way leaves no trace.
Good speech leaves no flaw.
Good strategy requires no calculations.
Good closure needs no lock or key to remain sealed.
Good binding requires no cords or knots to remain fastened.

**Extended Meaning:**
Like Zhuāngzi’s *"coverage speech"*—
*"coverage speech"* being words spoken in moderation.
*(Quoted from the *Zhuāngzi’s* "Parables" [寓言]:)*
*"Parables are nineteen in ten,
repeated sayings seventeen in ten.
Coverage speech emerges daily,
harmonized with Heaven’s natural flow.
Thus, one elaborates endlessly,
spending a lifetime in speech.
Yet when one does not speak, it is complete—
speech and non-speech are both complete,
and complete speech is non-speech.
Thus, it is said: ‘No speech.’
No-speech, yet lifelong speech,
never ceasing to speak.

There are things that are so by themselves,
and things that are not so by themselves;
things that are good by themselves,
and things that are not good by themselves.
How can they be so? They are so by being so.
How can they not be so? They are not so by not being so.
How can they be good? They are good by being good.
How can they be not good? They are not good by not being good.
Things inherently have their ‘so’ and their ‘good’—
none are inherently ‘not so’ or ‘not good.’
If not for coverage speech emerging daily,
harmonized with Heaven’s natural flow,
who could endure it long?
If one seeks to speak,
and aligns with this,
what flaw could there be?
Thus, it is said: *‘Good speech leaves no flaw.’*

**Extended Meaning:**
Zhuāngzi said:
*"One and speech make two;
two and one make three.
From here onward,
even the most skilled cannot proceed,
let alone the ordinary."*

*(Quoted from the *Zhuāngzi’s* "Equating Things" [齐物论]:)*
*"Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair,
yet Tai Mountain is small.
No one is shorter-lived than a stillborn child,
yet Pángzǔ is prematurely dead.
Heaven and Earth were born with me,
and all things are one with me.
Since we are already one,
how can there be speech?
Since we are already one,
how can there not be speech?
One and speech make two;
two and one make three.
From here onward,
even the most skilled cannot proceed,
let alone the ordinary.
Thus, from non-being to being, up to three—
how much more so from being to being?
No place to go,
thus it is so.
This is the value of having nowhere to go,
returning to the origin of One,
harmonized with the Dao—
what need for calculations?
Thus, it is said: *‘Good strategy requires no calculations.’*

**Extended Meaning:**
The nine orifices are the gates of *spirit-qi*.
*(Quoted from the *Zhuāngzi’s* "Northward Expanse" [北游]:)*
Zhuāngzi said:
*"The luminous arises from the obscure,
order from the formless,
spirit-qi from the Dao,
form from spirit-qi—
and all things are born from form.
Thus, those with nine orifices are born from the womb,
those with eight from eggs.
Their coming has no trace,
their birth no boundary—
no doors, no rooms,
yet they move freely in all four directions.
This is the nature of *spirit-qi*,
moving without progress,
abandoning the body in non-progress,
lodging the spirit beyond the eight directions—
thus, no gates or thresholds,
no borders or limits,
yet they pervade the four quarters,
communing with all things.
Now, extending this meaning,
the nine orifices are the gates of *spirit-qi*—
thus, it is said: *‘Good closure needs no lock or key.’*
Therefore, the sage always rescues people well,
leaving none abandoned.
Always rescues things well,
leaving none discarded.
This is called *‘following clarity.’*

**Extended Meaning:**
Even tiles and bricks, ladders and screens,
each have their proper use—
thus, it is said: *‘Always rescues things well.’*
*(Quoted from the *Zhuāngzi’s* "Northward Way" [北道]:)*
*"Dōngguōzi dwelled in the Eastern Suburb."*

Dōngguōzi asked of Zhuāngzi: *"Where, then, is this Dao you speak of?"*
Zhuāngzi replied: *"It is nowhere and everywhere."*

Dōngguōzi said: *"Only after you specify can I understand."*
He wished Zhuāngzi to name its exact location.

Zhuāngzi said: *"It is in the ant."*
*"How low!"* Dōngguōzi exclaimed.
*"It is in the millet."* Zhuāngzi replied.
*"How even lower!"*
*"It is in the tiles and bricks."*
*"How even more so!"*
*"It is in excrement and urine."*

Dōngguōzi had no response.

Zhuāngzi said: *"Your question, Master, did not reach the essence. This speaks of the Dao—though pure and exalted, it embraces all things, high or low, fulfilling their nature without abandoning any."*

**Extended Meaning:**
The *Huáinánzǐ* records that when Gōngsūn Lóng was in Zhào,
*(Quoted from the *Huáinánzǐ Hóngliè Jiědào Yìngxùn* [淮南子鸿烈解道应训篇]):*
This meaning is already complete; no need to repeat it.
It fundamentally confirms the principle of *"always rescuing people well, leaving none abandoned."*

Thus, the virtuous person is the teacher of the unvirtuous,
and the unvirtuous person is the resource of the virtuous.

**Extended Meaning:**
In ancient times, the Chu general Zǐfā sought those skilled in arts.
*(Quoted from the *Huáinánzǐ Hóngliè Jiědào Yìngxùn*):*
The meaning is already recorded; no need to transcribe again.
It fundamentally confirms the principle of *"the unvirtuous as the resource of the virtuous."*

To neither honor one’s teacher nor cherish one’s resource—
though one may claim knowledge, it is utter confusion.
This is called *"the pinnacle of subtlety."*

**Extended Meaning:**
Seeking its ultimate truth, it arises from innate nature—
this is called *‘self-so transformation.’*
*(Quoted from *Zhuāngzi*’s "Form and Shadow" [形影篇], Guōxiàng’s annotation:)*
*"If one depends on serpent scales or cicada wings,
there is no singular virtue to recognize,
yet it is not difficult to discern.
Now, those who fail to recognize it
do so precisely because they do not depend on such things
and instead manifest self-so transformation."*

Now, the reclusive Daoists take this as proof
that self-so transformation stems from innate nature—
why then honor or cherish it?

**Extended Meaning:**
Bólè cannot transform a dull horse into a fine steed.
*(Annotation: Bólè, surname Sūn, given name Yáng, styled Bólè,
a man of Qin Mùgōng’s time,
skilled in horsemanship. *Nǔtuí* refers to a dull horse;
*qílì* refers to a dragon-horse.
It states that though Bólè was skilled in horses,
he could not make a dull horse into a dragon-horse.)*

**Extended Meaning:**
A master craftsman cannot carve *zhū* or *lì* into beams.
*(Annotation: The *zhū* tree, as in *Zhuāngzi*’s "Free and Easy Wandering" [逍遥游篇],*
where Huìzǐ, surname Huì, given name Shī—
a friend or disciple of Zhuāngzi—
said to Zhuāngzi: *"I have a great tree,
which people call *zhū*.
If you hollow it, it is damp inside;
it is a worthless wood.
Its trunk is swollen and does not conform to the plumb line,
its branches are twisted and do not fit the compass.
Place it by the road, and no craftsman will look at it.
Now, your words are great yet useless—
just as this tree, which all reject."*
Zhuāngzi replied: *"Have you not seen the weasel?
It crouches low, waiting for the arrogant.
It pounces on the haughty wild rat,
leaping east and west without fear of height or depth.
It falls into snares and dies in nets.
So too, those who cling to the traces of the sage,
feigning emotions and actions to gain immediate advantage,
avoiding no peril—
they will surely meet misfortune later.
Now, the ox *máo* is vast as a cloud hanging from the sky.
This is greatness, yet it cannot catch a mouse.
Now, you have this great tree, yet you lament its uselessness—
why not plant it in the land of *Wúhéyǒuyǒu*,
in the boundless wilderness,
where it wanders freely beside the Uncarved,
and reposes at ease beneath its shade?
No axes or blades will harm it,
no thing will injure it—
where is its constraint or suffering?"*

Again, the *lì* tree, as in *Zhuāngzi*’s "Human World" [人间世]:
When Jiàngshí arrived in Qūyuán,
he reached Qūxián’s crooked path—
a road named after its crookedness—
and saw a *lì* tree.
Its trunk covered an ox,
its girth measured a hundred spans,
its height surpassed the mountain by ten *rèn* and seven feet.
Yet it had branches,
and ten or more could be made into boats.
Onlookers gathered like a market,
but Jiàngshí passed without a glance,
walking on without pause.
His disciple, weary of observing,
ran to catch up with Jiàngshí and said:
*"Since I followed you with axe and adze,
I have never seen wood as fine as this.
Yet you refuse to look, walking on without stopping—why?"*
Jiàngshí said: *"Enough! Do not speak of it again.
This is useless wood—
if made into a boat, it sinks;
if made into a coffin, it rots quickly;
if made into doors or windows, it leaks.
Its sap and pitch cannot be cut by axe or adze.
If made into a pillar, it is riddled with worms.
This is wood of no use,
and thus it lives so long."*

Now, those who cite this speak of the transmission between teacher and student:
If one encounters those with innate talent,
they can be taught and shaped into vessels.
If one lacks innate talent,
even instruction will not succeed—
just as Bólè could not transform a dull horse into a dragon-horse,
or a master craftsman could not carve *zhū* or *lì* into beams.

**Extended Meaning:**
Lìzǐ studied under Lǎoshāngshì and befriended Bó Gāozǐ,
and thus attained the inner and outer winds of the transcendent.
*(Quoted from *Lièzǐ*’s "Huángdì" [黄帝篇]:*
Lìzǐ studied under Lǎoshāngshì and befriended Bó Gāozǐ,
advancing their teachings and returning by wind.
Yǐn Shēng heard of this and resided with Lìzǐ for months without asking.
Yet when he secretly requested the method ten times,
Lìzǐ refused him ten times.
Yǐn Shēng, angered, sought to leave,
but Lìzǐ did not inquire.
Yǐn Shēng withdrew for months,
his mind unsettled, and again went to him.
Lìzǐ said: *"Why do you come and go so frequently?"*)

「Yǐn Shēng said: *"In the past, when Zhāng Dài requested [the method] from you, you did not tell him, and he certainly held resentment toward you. Now you have suddenly abandoned him, so that is why he comes again."*

Lìzǐ said: *"In the past, I considered you as one who had attained the Dao. Now I see your vulgarity has reached this point! I shall reveal to you what I learned from my Master.*

*When I first served my Master and befriended others like you, after three years, my heart dared not ponder right or wrong, my mouth dared not speak of gain or harm, and only then did my Master cast a single glance upon me.*

*After five years, my heart still hesitated to ponder right or wrong, my mouth still dared not speak of gain or harm, and only then did my Master begin to smile.*

*After seven years, I followed my heart’s thoughts—no right or wrong—and my mouth’s words—no gain or harm. Only then did my Master invite me to sit beside him.*

*After nine years, I aligned my heart’s thoughts and my mouth’s words, neither knowing my own right or wrong, gain or harm, nor his own, nor even recognizing my Master as my Master or my friends as my friends. The inner and outer winds of the transcendent had fully awakened in me.*

*Then my eyes became like ears, ears like nose, nose like mouth—no distinction between them. My mind concentrated, my form released, my bones and flesh dissolved into oneness, and I no longer knew where my body leaned or my feet trod. I drifted east and west with the wind, like a dry leaf or empty husk, utterly unaware whether the wind rode me or I rode the wind.*

*Now you dwell at your Master’s doorstep, not even completing the minimal span of time, yet you resent and grumble repeatedly. Your slightest part will be abandoned by qi, your smallest node will be cast off by the earth. How can you hope to walk upon the void and ride the wind?*

Yǐn Shēng was deeply ashamed, held his breath for a long while, and dared not speak again.

*If Lìzǐ and Lǎoshāngshì could truly be called those who forget their teachers and their teachings, then today I take this to prove the meaning of not valuing one’s teacher and not cherishing one’s teachings.*

**Extended Meaning:**
*Confucius, upon seeing Tàigōng Rèn, then abandoned his disciples and renounced his associations.*

Quoted from *Zhuāngzǐ*’s *"Shānmù"* [山木篇]:
*Confucius was trapped between Chén and Cài, seven days without food. Tàigōng Rèn went to comfort him and said: "Master, are you near death?" He replied: "Yes." "Do you dislike death?" He replied: "Yes." Tàigōng Rèn said: "You have spoken of the way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea, there is a bird called Yìdài. Its appearance is drooping and sluggish, unable to soar high. Yet it seems powerless, yet it rises with a gentle push and rests in the shelter of others, never daring to lead when advancing, nor lag when retreating, never daring to taste first when feeding—it must wait for the remnants. Thus, its movements are never singled out, and it blends with the crowd. Yet outsiders can never harm it, so it avoids calamity. Straight trees are cut first, sweet wells are drained first. Your cleverness deceives the ignorant, your polished conduct reveals the filthy—your brilliance is like displaying the sun and moon in daylight, so you cannot escape misfortune."*

*I once heard from a Great Achiever say: "Those who boast of their own merits have no true merit. When merit is attained, it is lost. When fame is gained, it is diminished. Who can abandon merit and fame and return to the common folk? The Dao flows without claiming residence, virtue acts without seeking recognition—pure and constant, this is the way of the mad. They discard their traces and abandon their influence, not striving for merit or fame. Thus, they bear no blame from others, nor do others blame them. The Perfect Ones are unheard of. Why do you take such joy in this?"*

Confucius said: *"Excellent! To renounce one’s associations and abandon one’s disciples, to flee to the Great Marsh, wearing coarse hemp garments, eating acorns and chestnuts, entering the realm of beasts without disturbing their order, entering the realm of birds without disrupting their flight—if beasts and birds do not harm them, how much more so will humans?"*

**Extended Meaning:**
*The Seven Saints were all lost in confusion, with nowhere to inquire about the Dao.*

Quoted from *Zhuāngzǐ*’s *"Xúwúguǐ"* [徐无鬼篇]:
*Huángdì was about to meet Dàwěi at Jùcí Mountain. Fāngmíng acted as charioteer, Chāngyú as the companion riding beside the chariot, Zhāng Ruò and Zhōu Yǐn as the leading horses. Kūn Hūn and Huá Gǔ served as rear attendants. When they reached the wilderness of Xiāngchéng, the Seven Saints were all lost in confusion. Today, your state has a Xiāngchéng County, located south of Tàiyǐ Mountain—this is where Huángdì sought the Dao.*

*From Huángdì onward, including Huá Gǔ, there were a total of seven such Saints.*

Annotation: *Saints—this is a title. Once names arise, the Way is lost.*

*Even if you desire it, Dàwěi is beyond reach. Nowhere to inquire about the Dao.*

*They encountered a young boy tending horses, and asked him about the Way. The boy was a Daoist.*

*"Do you know of Jùcí Mountain?"* The boy replied: *"Yes."* *"Do you know where Dàwěi resides?"* The boy replied: *"Yes."*

Huángdì said: *"Strange, little boy! Not only do you know of Jùcí Mountain, but you also know where Dàwěi resides. May I ask you about governing the world?"*

The boy said: *"Governing the world is no different from this! What more is there to do?*

*Knowing its grandeur yet guarding its humiliation—this is the way to govern the world.*

*To govern the world by guarding its humiliation, one’s constant virtue is then sufficient, returning to simplicity.*

**Extended Meaning:**
*Grass and trees flourish as honor. Quoted from the* **Zhōuyǐ** [周易] *Būn* [坤] *Hexagram’s text:*

*"Heaven and Earth undergo transformations, and grass and trees flourish. Heaven and Earth close in, and the virtuous withdraw."*

*Kǒng Yǐngdá’s* **Zhèngyì** [正义] *states:*

*"This passage explains the six lines: Heaven and Earth undergo transformations refers to the interaction of yin and yang, nurturing all things, so grass and trees flourish. Simplicity disperses to form vessels; the Sage employs it to become an official or leader, so great institutions do not sever."*

**Extended Meaning:**
*Zǐgōng asked Confucius: "How would I fare, Master?"*

Confucius said: *"You are a vessel."* [Quoted from *Lúnyǔ* [论语] *Gōngyězhǎng* [公冶长] Fifth]

Zǐgōng asked: *"How would I fare, Master?"*
Confucius said: *"You are a vessel."*
Zǐgōng said: *"What kind of vessel?"*
Confucius said: *"A hu-lü."* [A vessel of refined use]
Vessels are made from materials fit for purpose—
In the Xia, it was called *hu*;
In the Shang, it was called *lü*;
In the Zhou, it was called *fúguǐ*;
All were ritual vessels for storing millet in ancestral temples, adorned with jade.
They are the most noble and splendid of vessels.

**Chapter 29: Jiāngyù** [将欲]
*"If one would take the world by force, I see that it cannot be done."*

**Extended Meaning:**
Shun avoided Emperor Yao’s son in the southern reaches of the River,
And the lords of the states—those who came to pay homage,
those who sought justice,
those who sang and praised—
all went to Shun, not to Yao’s son.
This was not the way of seizing the world by force.

[Quoted from *Mèngzǐ* [孟子] *Wànzhāng Zhāngjù Shàng* [万章章句上]]
Shun served as Yao’s minister for twenty-eight years—
a feat no mortal could achieve; it was the will of Heaven.
When Yao passed away and the three-year mourning ended,
Shun retreated to the southern bank of the River,
yet the lords of the states came to pay homage to him,
those who sought justice came to him,
and those who sang and praised sang and praised him.
Thus it was said: *"It was Heaven’s doing."*
Only then did he enter the Central States and ascend to the throne of the Son of Heaven.

Now, this serves as proof:
Shun’s rule was granted by Heaven and accepted by the people—
not seized by force.

The world is a sacred vessel—
it cannot be taken by force.
Those who attempt to seize it will fail;
those who grasp it will lose it.

**Extended Meaning:**
The sacred vessel refers to the supreme position,
a divine instrument of Heaven and Earth.
[Quoted from *Yì Xìshí* [易系辞]]
*"The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is to give birth.
The greatest treasure of the Sage is his position.
How does one preserve this position? By virtue (rén)."*
The world is vast, governed by a divine principle—
how could it be seized by force?
Even if obtained, it must be lost—
how can one not be cautious?

**Extended Meaning:**
*Zhuāngzǐ* recounts how Tiāngēn wandered in the realm of Yīn Tāng,
reaching the banks of Liǎoshuǐ,
where he encountered a nameless man and asked him:
*"May I ask about ruling the world?"*
The nameless man replied: *"Leave! You are a vulgar man—
why ask what you cannot comprehend?"*
[Quoted from *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] *Yìngdìwáng* [应帝王]]

Tiāngēn was a proper name wandering in Yīn Tāng’s domain,
arriving at Liǎoshuǐ’s banks,
where he met the nameless man and questioned him—
his intent was on the world.
The nameless man again said:
*"You wander in the boundless,
harmonizing your qi with the void,
following nature without artifice—
and the world will be governed."*

**Extended Meaning:**
*"When the seven orifices were pierced, HúnDùn died."*
[Quoted from *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] *Yìngdìwáng*]
The passage has been detailed elsewhere and need not be repeated.

The extended meaning states:
*"Whipping and urging with threats exhausts the horse’s strength."*
[Quoted from *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] *Mǎtí* [马蹄] passage.]

The Great Dao is abandoned—its principles have been fully expounded elsewhere and need not be repeated.

Thus, the Sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids excessiveness.

The extended meaning states:
*"Hence, Zhòngní [Confucius] did not overdo things."*
[Quoted from *Mèngzǐ* [孟子] *Líliú Zhāngjù Shàng* [离娄章句下], where Mèngzǐ [孟子] says:]
*"Zhòngní [Confucius] did not overdo things."*
[Commentary by Yáng Shì [杨氏] states:]
*"This means the Sage never exceeded his proper bounds—not even by a hair’s breadth. This was not Mèngzǐ’s true insight; Zhòngní [Confucius] could not have been praised in such terms."*

The extended meaning states:
*"Ritual—when in doubt, choose frugality over extravagance."*
[Quoted from *Lúnyǔ* [论语] *Bāyì Dìsān* [八佾第三], where Zǐ [子] says:]
*"Great indeed is your question!
Ritual—when in doubt, choose frugality over extravagance.
Mourning—when in doubt, choose grief over ease."*
These are the words of Zhòngní [Confucius] in response to Lín Fàng [林放], a man of Lǔ [鲁].

The extended meaning states:
*"Shùn [舜] received Yáo’s [尧] realm yet did not consider it excessive."*
[Quoted from *Mèngzǐ* [孟子] *Téngwén Gōng Zhāngjù Xià* [滕文公章句下], where Páng Gēng [彭更], a disciple of Mèngzǐ [孟子], asked:]
*"With tens of chariots following, hundreds of attendants, and provisions received from the lords—is this not excessive?"*
Mèngzǐ [孟子] replied:
*"If it is not the proper path, even a single bowl of rice cannot be accepted from others.
If it is the proper path, then Shùn [舜] received Yáo’s [尧] realm without considering it excessive—do you deem it excessive?"*

This speaks of three faults in the Sage’s actions that, if committed, bring ruin. Thus, they are all avoided—through humility, restraint, and guarding the void—so as to align with the Dao. Only then will there be no burden of excess.

**Chapter Thirty: Aiding the Sovereign with the Dao**

*"Aiding the sovereign with the Dao"* means not to use military force to dominate the world.
Its actions favor reversibility.

The *Yuànyì* [Elucidation] states:
*"He who kills another’s father will have his own father killed.
He who kills another’s elder brother will have his own elder brother killed."*
This passage is excerpted from *Mèngzǐ [Mencius]—Exhausting the Heart, Lower Part*.

Mèngzǐ [Mencius] said:
*"Now I understand the weight of killing one’s own kin.
He who kills another’s father will have his own father killed.
He who kills another’s elder brother will have his own elder brother killed.
Yet this is not truly self-inflicted harm—it is merely a single step removed.
**Annotation:** A single step removed (*yī jiān* 一问) means: I go, and he comes; one person’s action returns upon another. In truth, it differs not from harming one’s own kin.*

The *Yuànyì* [Elucidation] further states:
*"What you send forth will return to you."*
This passage is excerpted from *Mèngzǐ [Mencius]—The Sententious Discourse of King Xuan of Liang, Lower Part*, where Zǒu [邹] and Lǔ [鲁] quarreled, and Mùgōng [穆公] inquired.
**Annotation:** *Zhǎn*  is the sound of combat.

Mèngzǐ [Mencius] replied:
*"In years of famine and scarcity, your people’s aged and infirm perish in ditches and ravines, while the strong flee to the four quarters—nearly a thousand have already departed! Yet your granaries overflow, your treasuries are full, and no official dares report this. This is to scorn above and oppress below.
Zēngzǐ [曾子] said: ‘Beware! Beware! What you send forth will return to you.’
Now the people have the means to repay you.
Let the sovereign take no offense."*

**Elucidation** further states:

*"The King of Chu, the King of Qi, Qin Shi Huang, and Han Emperor Wu—each met their fate either through death of themselves or misfortune upon their descendants."*

**Excerpted from:** *Chūnqiū [Spring and Autumn Annals]—The Sententious Discourse of Duke Zhao,* where the Prince Bǐ of Chu, Prince Hēigōng of the Lǔ clan, Prince Zhì, and Mànchéng Rén, the Lord of Cāi and Cháo, led the armies of Chén, Cāi, Bùjiāng, Xǔ, and Yè to invade Chu. They slaughtered Prince Lù and Prince Bàidí, then sent a messenger to summon the troops of the Ouyáng clan to join them at Qiānxī, where they turned against Chu. The armies were routed at Zǐ Liáng.

Upon hearing of the deaths of the princes, the King of Chu cast himself beneath his carriage and lamented: *"How could people love their children as I love mine?"*
The king declared: *"I have slain many sons of others—how could I avoid this fate?"*
*"Is this not Heaven’s retribution upon me?"*

Right Minister Zǐgé said: *"Let me wait at the outskirts to hear the voices of the people."*
The king replied: *"The wrath of the masses cannot be provoked."*
Zǐgé said: *"If we enter the capital and beg aid from the feudal lords."*
The king replied: *"They have all turned against me."*
Zǐgé said: *"If we abandon the feudal lords and instead submit to the designs of the great powers against you."*
The king replied: *"Great blessings do not repeat—only shame shall I reap."*

Yet, Dān returned to Chu. Zǐgé was strangled by the Lord of Yǐn, Shēnxià. The King of Chu died in exile at Gòng,—this was not death of himself alone, but misfortune upon his descendants, was it not?

**Excerpted from:** *Tōngjiàn [Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Governance]—The Era of Duke Qi,* where the General Lèyù of Yān led the armies of Qín, Wèi, Hán, and Zhào to attack Qi. Yù declared: *"The King of Qi boasts of his merits and flaunts his abilities, his schemes fail to reach the common folk, he discards the virtuous and relies upon flatterers, his decrees are harsh and cruel, the people resent him—his subjects will surely rebel, and Qi can be conquered."* The King of Qi fled to Jǔ.

The State of Chu sent Ruǎnchǐ to lead troops in Qi’s defense. Chǐ then became Qi’s prime minister. Desiring to divide Qi’s lands with Yān, he seized and executed the King of Qi.

Gǔzǐ [Gongsun Chuo] said: *"A state is the common benefit and advantage of all under Heaven. If one holds it by the Dao/Way, it brings great peace, great prosperity, and the accumulation of virtue. If one holds it without the Dao/Way, it brings great peril, great burdens, and it is better to have it not at all. When its decline reaches its extreme, even a commoner cannot escape it. The cases of Qi’s Duke Mǐn and Song’s Duke Xiàn are examples of this. This was not without the Dao/Way—yet each met their fate through death of themselves."*

The First Emperor of Qin, in his first year of Zhengshì (Year 1), from the *yǐmǎo* (2nd month of the 1st year) to the twenty-sixth year of *gēngchén* (7th month of the 26th year), pacified the feudal lords and extinguished the Six States, and took the title of First Emperor.

In the autumn of the thirty-seventh year, the seventh month, he died at the Sandbank Terrace.

Hú Hài ascended the throne, styling himself the Second Emperor. In the third year, the chancellor Zhào Gāo, fearing execution for himself, secretly ordered the magistrate of Xiányáng, Yān Lè, to lead a thousand or more scribes and soldiers to the Palace of the Watching Tides. Yān Lè went before the Second Emperor and repeatedly said: *"Your Majesty is arrogant and unchecked, slaughtering without the Dao/Way. All under Heaven have rebelled against Your Majesty—Your Majesty should consider your own fate."* Lè then advanced his troops. The Second Emperor killed himself. The child Yīng was then enthroned as the Qin King.

In the winter of the first year of the High Ancestor [Emperor Gaozu], the tenth month, Pèi Gōng arrived at Bàshàng. The Qin King Yīng came forth in a plain carriage with white horses, his neck bound with a rope, surrendering the imperial seal and the credentials of command. The *Zìshū* records the character *穿* as "chāo" (to pierce), and the *Zhìyǐn* (phonetic annotation) explains: *"The piercing of the wheel is pronounced 'chāo' with the tone of 穿."* Pèi Gōng then led his forces westward to slaughter Xiányáng, killing the surrendered Qin King Yīng and burning the Qin palaces. Yīng ruled for forty-six days until the state fell and he died—was this not a calamity upon his descendants?

In the autumn of the second year of Emperor Wǔ’s reign of *Hé* (Peace), the fourth month, the Emperor visited Gānquán. In the seventh month, the autumn, the Crown Prince Jù killed the envoy Jiāng Chōng, and, revealing this to Empress Hòu, raised troops in rebellion. The decree ordered the chancellor Qū Máo to suppress them. Jù fled to Lake Lú, and Empress Hòu Wèi, along with Jù, both killed themselves. The Hú clan [Empress Hòu’s family] said: *"The Emperor’s ambitions were vast, his desires many—he exhausted military strength and waged wars without restraint, undertook massive construction projects, and never ceased his tours. When the people’s strength was spent, bandits swarmed, and then great disaster befell his descendants—was this not fitting?"*

Where the Teacher’s forces have passed, thorny thickets spring up.
After the great armies, there will surely be years of famine.

The *Yan Yi* states: *"Fields lie fallow, stones exposed—thorny thickets spring up."* The annotation reads: *"Fields lie fallow, stones exposed"*—this is from the *Zhuangzi*’s [*Fisherman*] chapter: *"When officials attend to their duties and people worry over their affairs, then none overstep their bounds. Thus fields lie fallow, stones are exposed, clothing and food are insufficient, taxes and levies go unpaid, wives and concubines are discordant, and elders and juniors lack order—these are the woes of the common folk."* This clearly shows that after great armies pass, farmers lose their livelihoods, fields become overgrown with thorny thickets, and years of famine are sure to follow.

Thus, the virtuous act decisively but do not seek strength through it. Act decisively yet take no pride, act decisively yet boast not, act decisively yet grow not arrogant—when action is unavoidable, this is acting decisively without seeking strength.

The *Yan Yi* states: *"Since the Sage drew the trigrams, bending wood into bows and shaping wood into arrows, the sharpness of bows and arrows was used to awe the world."* This is quoted from the *Zhouyi’s* [*Lower Appendices*]. *"Bending wood into bows and shaping wood into arrows, the sharpness of bows and arrows was used to awe the world"*—this is derived from *Kui* [Divergence]. *Kui* means "contrariety." When things are contrary, disputes arise, and the use of bows and arrows is to awe and suppress such disputes. This was the Sage’s reluctant resort to force, demonstrating his awe—not that he delighted in killing.

The *Yan Yi* states: *"Gengsangzi said: The origin of war began with the first appearance of humankind."* He also said: *"If there were a throat medicine that could kill, one should not ban all physicians in the world."* As for warfare, it cannot be abolished in the world. Those who govern with the Dao as their assistant should uphold the yielding and tranquil, not rely on force to dominate the world. If attacked by an enemy and forced to respond, then it is called skillful use of arms. This is quoted from the *Kangcangzi’s* [*On Military Strategy*] chapter. Now, these are taken as evidence: though war cannot be abolished, one must not rely on it, warning against using force to dominate the world.

The *Yan Yi* states: *"The Spring and Autumn Annals says: Killing the enemy is decisive."* The annotation reads: *"In the second year of Duke Huan of Lu, Spring, the Spring and Autumn Annals records that the Marquis Gui of Zheng, having received his orders from Chu, attacked Song. Hua Yuan of Song, leading the armies of Le and Ju, confronted them. On the 12th day of the second month, they clashed at Da Ji, and the Song forces were routed. Hua Yuan was captured, and his capture was made known to demonstrate his survival. They seized Le and Ju’s commander, Hua Yuan, along with 460 chariots and 250 captives, and cut off the heads of 100 others. The Song minister Kuang Jiao welcomed the Zheng forces, but the Zheng soldiers threw him into a well. Kuang Jiao was a Song minister. They overturned their spears to rescue him, capturing Kuang Jiao instead. The sage said: ‘He violated protocol and disobeyed orders—it was fitting that he be taken prisoner.’ In warfare, the display of decisive resolve and attentive listening is called ‘protocol.’ Listening means keeping orders constantly in mind, internalizing them, and imagining their implementation. Killing the enemy is decisive; achieving decisiveness is resolute. If one reverses this, one will surely be punished. Reversing it is punishment. Before the battle, Hua Yuan slaughtered sheep to feed the soldiers, but his charioteer, Yang Zhen, refused to partake. In battle, Yang Zhen said: ‘Yesterday’s sheep was yours to command; today’s matter is mine to command.’ He fought against the Zheng forces, and thus their army was defeated. The sage said: ‘Yang Zhen was not a true man. Out of personal resentment, he caused the nation’s treasures to be exhausted.’ What greater crime is there than this? The *Shijing* speaks of ‘the unvirtuous among men’—taking from the *Small Odes*, it refers to how unvirtuous men blame one another and bring ruin. This was Yang Zhen’s case. Thus, killing the enemy is decisive, meaning to stop the enemy. When war is unavoidable, it is used to stop the enemy, so that they no longer become raiders—hence, ‘not daring to seek strength through it.’"*

The *Yan Yi* states: *"After Tang conquered Xia, he spoke of his temporary virtue."* The annotation reads: *"From the Shang Book’s* [*Commissioner Zhi’s Instructions to Tang*]. Tang exiled Jie to Nan Chao, a place named ‘Only Shameful Virtue.’ He said: ‘I fear that future generations will use this as grounds for criticism.’ Though Tang followed Heaven and responded to the people, having inherited the succession from Yao, Shun, and Yu, he still felt uneasy in his heart, ashamed that his virtue did not match the ancients, as if fearing that the world would later use this as grounds for criticism."*

The *Yan Yi* states: *"When returning to Bo, he had the fear of standing at the brink."* The annotation reads: *"Tang’s Speech."* The king, having conquered Xia, returned to Bo and proclaimed his intentions to all under Heaven. Bo was Tang’s capital, located in Gu Shu County of Song Prefecture. He said: *"Let me, as one man, unite and pacify this land—thus securing my state. But I fear I have not yet measured up to the expectations of Heaven and Earth, trembling with dread as if about to fall into a deep abyss."* Heaven entrusted me to unite and pacify this land, but the weight of this responsibility is so great that I fear I am unworthy. I do not yet know if I have offended Heaven and Earth, and I am filled with terror, as if standing at the brink of a deep abyss.

The *Yan Yi* states: *"In the Spring and Autumn period, Wu had once defeated Yue but harbored contempt for Chu."* This is detailed in the *Spring and Autumn* annotations and need not be repeated. *"When things flourish, they decline—this is called ‘not the Way.’ The un-Way perishes early."*

The *Yan Yi* states: *"The Way exists before the ancient sages but is not called ‘first.’"* This is quoted from the *Zhuangzi’s* [*Master of the Heavenly Pattern*] chapter. *"Before the Great Ultimate, it was not called ‘high’; beneath the six extremes and six unities, it was not called ‘deep’; before Heaven and Earth came into being, it was not called ‘long-lasting’; enduring beyond the ancient sages, it was not called ‘old.’"* This speaks of the Way being everywhere yet nowhere, its presence everywhere yet its essence nowhere. The *Chapter on the Mysterious Oneness* has already elaborated on this. The *Chapter on Fine Arms* follows as the thirty-first.

The *Yan Yi* states: *"The gentleman values the left when at home but the right when wielding arms. Arms are an ill-omened instrument, not the tool of the gentleman; when unavoidable, they are used with equanimity as the highest principle."*

The *Yan Yi* elaborates: *"When barbarians and Yi tribesmen [or ‘uncivilized’ peoples] act deceitfully against the Xia—when raiders or violent bandits prey upon others—this is quoted from the *Shun’s Appointments* chapter. The Emperor Shun commanded Gao Yao: ‘Barbarians and Yi tribesmen act deceitfully against the Xia; raiders are called *kòu*, bandits *zéi*, the treacherous are *jiān*, and those who sow internal discord are *niè*. You shall be the *shì* [officer], overseeing the administration of punishments. The five punishments must be meted out with due deliberation, and the five stages of exile must be justly applied. Only the enlightened can truly fulfill this.’ This speaks of Shun’s command to Gao Yao as the *shì*, where the barbarians and Yi tribesmen, the *Róng* and *Dì* [or ‘uncivilized’ peoples], sow chaos within the central Xia, harming the common folk. You, as the *shì*, must govern and resolve these matters, ensuring your wisdom and discernment are unerring so that punishments fit the crimes and all submit without doubt. The five stages of exile refer to the severity of the crime, while the ‘three applications’ are interpreted by Confucius as: the greatest crimes are punished in the open fields, lesser ones by the great ministers in the court, and the smallest by the officers in the marketplace. The five degrees of exile denote those deserving leniency, yet their dwellings are still classified into three ranks—just as the five grades of nobility are divided into three tiers. Though the use of arms and warfare may be unavoidable, the gentleman acts only when compelled, hence the saying: ‘The gentleman of the Dao uses arms only when he has no choice.’*

The *Yan Yi* elaborates further: *"To conquer and settle chaos and violence is the proper use of arms. To prevail in battle is called ‘conquest’ (*kè*), to inflict harm on others is ‘calamity’ (*huò*), and to act contrary to virtue, spreading confusion, is ‘disorder’ (*luàn*). This is quoted from: ‘To conquer and settle chaos’—this is how Jiāng Zǐyá [Maizi of Qi] of the Jiāng clan, fishing at the Pán River, split a fish and found a jade pendant within, inscribed with this text, titled *The Six Taos* (*Liù Táowéi*). The first is the *Wén Táowéi* [‘Cultural Tao’], adhering to the Dao of the state without transgressing Heaven’s natural order. The second is the *Wǔ Táowéi* [‘Martial Tao’], conquering chaos and subduing the eight directions with might. The third is the *Lóng Táowéi* [‘Dragon Tao’], harmonizing yin and yang without overstepping seasonal command. The fourth is the *Hǔ Táowéi* [‘Tiger Tao’], skillfully employing claws and fangs to crush the wicked. The fifth is the *Bào Táowéi* [‘Leopard Tao’], seizing opportunities to quell disasters with wisdom rooted in strategy and timing. The sixth is the *Quǎn Táowéi* [‘Hound Tao’], probing the subtlest intelligence or achieving unexpected feats through reconnaissance. *Táo* means ‘to conceal’—the arts of warfare and stratagem must not be lightly revealed to others, hence the term ‘concealed Tao.’*

The *Yan Yi* elaborates: *"This is not for the sake of coveting land or wealth. This is quoted from the time of Emperor Xuān of the Han Dynasty, when Wèi Xián served as Chancellor. During the *Yuán Kāng* era, the Xiongnu sent troops to attack the Han, encroaching upon their cultivated fields. The military commander could not repel them. The emperor consulted with General Zhōngguó Zhāng Zǐguó and others, intending to exploit the Xiongnu’s decline by sending troops to strike their right flank, preventing further harassment of the Western Regions. The chancellor submitted a memorial advising: ‘I have heard that armies raised to rescue chaos and punish tyranny are called *yìbīng* [‘righteous armies’], and armies of righteousness bring victory. When enemies attack us and we rise in response, this is called *yìngbīng* [‘retaliatory armies’], and armies that retaliate prevail. When one fights over petty grievances, unable to tolerate anger, this is called *fènbīng* [‘wrathful armies’], and armies born of wrath are defeated. When one seeks to seize another’s land or treasures, this is called *tān bīng* [‘greedy armies’], and greedy armies are destroyed. When one relies on the state’s power and the people’s numbers, desiring to display one’s might over enemies, this is called *jiāo bīng* [‘proud armies’], and proud armies perish. These five principles are not merely human affairs; they align with the *Xuán Tóng* [‘Mysterious Unity’], taken as evidence to prove their truth, and when unavoidable, they are the truth—yet one must not force them.’ The above aligns with the *Wénzǐ’s* [*Chapter on the Martial Dao*] section.*

The *Yan Yi* elaborates: *"When Bái Gōng of Chu rebelled, his forces were subdued by the *jiā* [a penal measure], and Yí Liáo of Shì Nán [Market South] played with his balls, resolving the feud between the two families. Sūn Shū’áo [Chancellor of Chu] lay down with a feather fan, and the people of Yǐng [Chu capital] abandoned their rebellion. This is quoted from the *Xuánwúguǐ* [‘Spiritless Xuán’] chapter of the *Zhuangzi*. Though these matters have been detailed elsewhere, I quote them here to illustrate how Yí Liáo of Shì Nán and Sūn Shū’áo both employed the un-Way of the Way and the unstated eloquence of the unstated to resolve the feuds of the two families. This may be called ‘victory without battle, equanimity as the highest principle.’ To relish in victory yet not take pride in it, while others praise it, is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their ambitions in the world. This is quoted from the *Liáng Huì Wáng* [‘Dialogues with King Liang of Huì’] chapter of the *Mencius*. Mencius saw King Xiāng of Liáng, the son of King Huì, named Hé. Upon leaving, he remarked: ‘Looking at him, he did not seem like a ruler; approaching him, I saw no one to fear. Suddenly, he asked: “How shall the world be settled?” I replied: “It is settled by unity.” Who can achieve unity? The king asked again, and I answered: “Those who do not delight in killing can achieve unity.” *Shì* means ‘to love’ or ‘to be fond of.’ Yet among those who shepherd the world, there are none who do not delight in killing. If there were someone who did not delight in killing, then the people of the world would all crane their necks, eagerly awaiting him. Truly so, the people would flock to him like water rushing downward, unstoppable.’ This is quoted from the *Lièzǐ* [‘Liezi’], where Zhào Xiāngzǐ dispatched his newly appointed officer Xīnzhì Mùzǐ to attack the Zhái [a tribe], and he emerged victorious. This is also quoted from the *Shuō Fú* [‘Discussing the Seal’] chapter of the *Zhuangzi*. Though these matters have been detailed elsewhere, I quote them here to illustrate how those who do not delight in killing can achieve unity."*

「When it comes to auspicious matters, precedence is given to the left; for inauspicious matters, to the right. The *Piān Jiāngjūn* [“Associate General”] is placed on the left, and the *Shàng Jiāngjūn* [“Commanding General”] on the right—this is explained through the *Sāng Lǐ* [“Funeral Rites”]. Quoted from: *‘Precedence on the left, precedence on the right’*—this is from the *Tán Qióng* [“The Dried Bamboo”] chapter of the *Lǐjì* [“Book of Rites”]. Its meaning has already been detailed elsewhere; no need to repeat it here.

Now, if one were to take this as an analogy: suppose a valiant warrior achieves victory and earns distinction, rising to the rank of *Shàng Jiāngjūn* [“Commanding General”] and dwelling on the right to preside over killing—then it is said that victory is treated with the rites of mourning, and he is not worthy of elevation.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao/Way is Ever Nameless**
The Dao/Way is ever nameless.
*Pǔ* [“uncarved wood”/“primordial simplicity”], though humble, yet the world dares not subjugate it.
If lords and kings could uphold it, all things would naturally submit in reverence.

**Elaborating the Meaning:**
The talents of the world include those who can command the eyes through clarity, the ears through sharpness, the strength through valor, and the speech through eloquence. These are all named qualities, which the Dao/Way of nameless simplicity does not employ. Quoted from the *Zhòng Nǐ* [“Confucius”] chapter of the *Lièzǐ* [“Liezi”]:
The marshes of *Zhèng* [“Zheng”] were abundant with sages, and the *East Rì* [“East Village”] was rich with talents.
Among the marsh’s retainers was a man called *Bó Fēngzǐ* [“Master Bo Feng”], who, while passing through the East Village, encountered *Dèng Xī* [“Deng Xi”].
Deng Xi glanced at his followers and laughed: *“You dance and prance to deceive that coming one, Master Bo Feng! What do you think of him?”*
His followers replied: *“We wish to know his reputation.”*
Deng Xi was a renowned debater and sage of Zheng.
He asked Bo Fengzǐ: *“Do you understand the principle of nurturing?”*
*“He who loves and nurtures others yet cannot nurture himself is but a dog or pig.”*
*“To nurture things while they in turn serve you—that is the power of man.”*
*“If you command your followers to eat until full, wear until at ease, and manage state affairs, then you are fulfilling the role of a governing official. Yet they gather in age groups, and you provide them with nothing more than prison cells, stables, and kitchens—what difference is there between you and a dog or pig?”*
Bo Fengzǐ did not respond.
Then Bo Fengzǐ’s followers, one by one, stepped forward and said: *“Master, you have not heard of the abundance of skilled craftsmen in Qi and Lu? There are those who excel in earthwork and carpentry, those who excel in metalwork and leathercraft, those who excel in music and song, those who excel in arithmetic and record-keeping, those who excel in military strategy, and those who excel in temple rites—all talents are present. Yet none hold official rank, nor can they be properly employed. Those who place them in office lack knowledge, and those who employ them lack ability. Yet it is knowledge and ability that are needed to employ them. The officials are merely those we appoint; why do you boast?”*
Deng Xi had no reply, and he fixed his gaze upon his followers before departing.
This illustrates how those with knowledge, talent, and ability are employed by those without—how can they be held in esteem?

Thus, those who embrace the Dao/Way of nameless simplicity do not flaunt their reputation or display their talents. They remain obscure and silent, wandering freely through the world, and none dare employ them. When ordinary men see such individuals, they do not need words to explain—merely by observing them, the Dao/Way is preserved. All things naturally submit and follow their transformation.
Hence, the Classic states:
*The Dao/Way is ever nameless.
Uncarved wood, though humble, yet the world dares not subjugate it.
If lords and kings could uphold it, all things would naturally submit in reverence.*

**Elaborating the Meaning:**
Even dust and chaff can mold the *Yáo Shùn* [“Emperors Yao and Shun”].
Quoted from the *Xiāoyáo Yóu* [“Free and Easy Wandering”] chapter of the *Zhuangzi*:
*“When the great flood submerged the heavens, they did not drown. In the great drought, metal and stone melted, mountains withered, yet they did not feel the heat.”*
It is their dust and chaff that could shape Yao and Shun—who would dare to treat such matters as their own?

**Annotation:**
Yao and Shun are merely names of worldly affairs.
Those who act for the sake of names are not true to the Dao/Way.
Thus, Yao and Shun are not merely Yao and Shun—they must embody the reality of the *Shénrén* [“Divine/Sage Person”].
Now, what we call Yao and Shun are but labels for their dust and chaff.

「The *Five-Peak* [Wǔfēng] Collection of Master Rùshòu Guózhèng

**Chapter Thirty-Three: *Knowing Others is Wisdom***

Knowing others is wisdom; knowing oneself is enlightenment.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
If one distinguishes black and white.

Quoted from the *Zhuāngzi* [“Master Zhuang”]—**Outer Chapters, *Tiānyùn* [“Heaven’s Destiny”] Scroll**—
Zhuāngzi said: “The wild goose [huà, also *hè*], like the crane, does not need to bathe daily to become white, nor does the crow need to be struck with pitch to become black. The simplicity of black and white is not what makes them distinct. This is because black and white are naturally so.”

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
Wisdom lies in discerning the vice and virtue of others.

Quoted from *Mèngzǐ* [“Master Meng”]:
“What resides in people is nothing finer than their pupils. The pupils cannot conceal their evil. If the heart is upright, the pupils will be bright. If the heart is not upright, the pupils will be dull. Listen to their words and observe their pupils, and how can one deceive you? How can one hide from you? *Yù* [“hide”]. This means that a person’s vice and virtue are revealed in their pupils. When people interact with things, their spirit manifests in their eyes. Thus, if the heart is upright, the spirit will gather and the eyes will shine. If the heart is not upright, the spirit will scatter and the eyes will grow dim. By observing this, one cannot fail to see a person’s vice and virtue, good and evil. Hence it is said: *Knowing others is wisdom; knowing oneself is enlightenment.*”

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
Yet they cannot see their own eyelashes.

Quoted from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Scroll of *Gēngsāng Chǔ* [“Elder Geng Sang”]**:
Lǎozi [Master Lao] said: “I once saw you as though you were my eyebrows and eyelashes, my hair and fur.” *Zhījiān* [“between”].

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
Then again, one must know oneself.

Quoted from the *Zhōuyǐ Xìcí* [“Appendices of the *Book of Changes*”]:
“Then again, one must know oneself”—meaning that if one can repeatedly reflect upon oneself, one will know one’s own gains and losses.

The one who overcomes others has strength; the one who overcomes themselves is powerful.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
The way of constant victory.

Quoted from the *Lièzǐ* [“Master Lie”]—**Scroll of *Huángdì* [“The Yellow Emperor”]**:
“There is a way of constant victory in the world, and there is a way that is not constant. The way of constant victory is called *softness* [rǒu]; the way that is not constant is called *strength* [qiáng]. These two terms may also be read as *ease* [yì]. Yet people do not know this. Hence, the teachings of antiquity say: ‘The strong first do not act like the strong; the soft first act like the soft.’ Those who first do not act like the strong, when they reach the point of acting like the strong, are in danger.”

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
Yì [Yi the Archer] excelled in archery, and Jīu [Jiutang] excelled in rowing boats, both relying on strength to overcome others. Yet neither attained their own death.

Quoted from the *Lúnyǔ* [“Analects”]—**Scroll of *Xiànwèn* [“Conduct and Military Affairs”], Chapter Fourteen**:
Nángōng Shì [Nan Gongshi] asked Confucius: “If it were Nan Róng [Nan Rong], who would Yi the Archer and Jiutang overcome in boat rowing, both would not attain their natural end. Yi was the ruler of the state of *Yǒuyú Shì* [‘State of Youyu’], the most skilled archer of his time. He usurped the throne of *Tàikàng* [‘Great Kang’] of the Xia dynasty and established himself, but his minister *Hándí* [Han Ni] killed him and took his place. The *Chūnqiū Zhuàn* [“Transmissions of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*”] states that Jiutang was the son of *Jiāo Tìng* [‘Jiao Ting’], whose strength allowed him to row a boat across land. Later, he was killed by *Xiàhòu Shàokāng* [‘Xiahou Shaokang’].”

Yì and Jiutang were both powerful and violent figures of old, yet neither attained their natural end. Both relied on their strength not only to overcome others but also to fail in overcoming themselves—this is what Lǎozi [Master Lao] warned people against.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
“To sit on gold and leather [*rèn jīn gé*], dying without regret”—this is the strength of the North.

Quoted from *Zhōngyōng* [“The Doctrine of the Mean”], Chapter Ten:
“To sit on gold and leather, dying without regret”—this is the strength of the North. *Rèn* [“sitting on”], meaning a mat or a bedroll. *Jīn gé* [“gold and leather”] refers to weapons: *gold* [jīn] to spears and *leather* [gé] to armor. The North’s climate is harsh and resolute, so to conquer others with daring strength is considered *strength*—the deed of the strong.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
The Master [Confucius] spoke of “harmony without dissipation, steadfastness without leaning”—this is the power of *rectification* [jiāo].

Quoted from *Zhōngyōng* [“The Doctrine of the Mean”], Chapter Ten:
“The gentleman is harmonious without dissipation, powerful in his steadfastness!” *Jiāo* [“powerful”] is described in the *Shījīng* [“Book of Odes”] as: *“Jiāo jiāo wǔ fū”* [“Resolute, resolute, the martial man”]. *Lì* [“lean”] means partiality or bias. This is what is called the impossible feat of the *middle path* [zhōngyōng]. It is not because they cannot overcome themselves; rather, it is because their personal desires cannot choose and hold to virtue and righteousness. Where does the Master’s power lie? In this, the Master instructed Zǐlú [Zilu], suppressing his impulsive vigor and advancing him with the courage of virtue and righteousness.

The contented attain wealth; the resolute attain purpose.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
Zhuāngzi said: “Zēngzǐ [Zengzi] dwelt in Wèi [Wei], wearing a patched hemp cloak with no lining.”

Quoted from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Scroll

「Not losing one’s place brings lasting stability; dying yet not perishing brings enduring life.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
It is the abiding constancy. The *Xiàng* [“image”/symbol] states: *“The noble man stands firm without altering his Dao/Way, thus not losing his place.”*
Quoted from the *Zhōuyǐ Dáguà* [“*Yì* [‘*Changes*]—**Hexagram of Constancy**] are the words of many: *“Constancy (héng) is enduring duration (jiǔ). The strong ascends while the yielding descends. The strong is revered; the yielding is humbled—thus one attains their yielding.”*
The *Xiàng* [“image”/symbol] says: *“Thunder and wind in constancy—thus the noble man stands firm without altering his Dao/Way.”*
The noble man establishes himself, attaining the Dao/Way of enduring duration, unchanging in his course. His course is like the Dao/Way itself.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
Lǐzǐ [Liezi]’s refusal to transform. Quoted from the *Lìzǐ* [“*Liezi*”]—**Scroll of Heaven and Destiny** are the words of his disciples. He said: *“There is birth yet no birth, there is transformation yet no transformation. Not born by things, not transformed by things—thus he can be born among all beings, transformed by all transformations.”*
He who does not birth can birth all things; he who does not transform can transform all things. The one who births cannot avoid birth; the one who transforms cannot avoid transformation.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
Zhuāngzi’s [Zhuangzi’s] immortality. Quoted from the *Zhuāngzi* [“*Zhuangzi*”]—**Scroll of the Great Master** says:
*“Only when external birth is achieved can one then attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, one can then perceive the singular. Perceiving the singular, one can then transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, one can then achieve neither death nor birth.”*
He who can harmonize with the *rén* [“human”] yet not exalt the morning, who forgets the far and near of time—this is the one who perceives the singular.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
The *Shì* [“Buddha”/“*Religion of the Thusness*”]’s imperishability. Quoted from the *Zhuándēng Lù* [*“Record of the Transmission of the Lamp”*]:
Huìnéng [Huineng] the Great Master said to the inner attendant Xuē Jiǎn [Xue Jian]: *“When I speak of neither birth nor annihilation, it is because originally there was no birth, and now there is no annihilation. This is the clear understanding of attaining eternal life.”*
This means: when a person dwells in the world between heaven and earth, if they rest in their innate nature, entrust themselves to the harmony of the Dao/Way, and come and go with the transformations of nature—then the noble man observes the actions of a person, and knows their longevity or brevity. How much more so for those who cultivate the Great Dao/Way and nourish the primordial *hé* [“harmony”], yet cannot attain eternal life?

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
*“The body is like cicada shell or snake skin—it is merely shed and abandoned.”*
Quoted from the *Zhuāngzi* [“*Zhuangzi*”]—**Scroll of Equalizing All Things** are the words:
Wàngliǎng [Wangliang] asked the *Yǐng* [“shadow”]. The shadow said: *“I await the snake’s shedding, its skin clinging beneath its belly, unable to move.”*
Is it like cicada wings? If one awaits the snake’s shedding like cicada wings, then there is no particular purpose to cling to—thus one seeks endless blame, ultimately reaching ‘no awaiting’ and not uniquely transforming in the *Xuānmíng* [“Mysterious Darkness”].

**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Great Dao/Way is Boundless**
The Great Dao/Way is boundless, yet it can be found on either side.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
The Dao/Way is supremely high and has no above; supremely deep and has no below. Above it, there is no above; below it, there is no below. It can be high and deep, can ascend and descend. Level as a carpenter’s rule, straight as a plumb line—yet not a rule to level, thus all is even; not a plumb line to straighten, thus all is upright.
Round as a compass, square as a set-square—yet not round to make round, thus without roundness; not square to make square, thus without squareness. It envelops heaven and earth yet has no outer or inner; its greatness has no limits, its subtlety no depths.
Piercing like an unfurling cover, yet nothing obstructs it. Great roundness without boundary, great passage without hindrance.
Thus, those who embody the Dao/Way do not grow angry nor rejoice. Their sitting is without care, their sleep without dreams—thus they are in perfect *Xuāntóng* [“Mysterious Harmony”].
As proof: the Dao/Way is vast and boundless, yet it can be found on either side.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**
The Great Dao/Way is nowhere not present—whether left or right, all encounter its source.
Quoted from the *Mèngzǐ* [“*Mencius*”]—**Scroll of Leaving and Liao** [“*Leaving and Liao*”] says:
*“The noble man deeply cultivates with the Dao/Way, seeking to attain it himself. Attaining it himself, he rests in it securely. Resting in it securely, his resources grow profound. His resources profound, he can take from it on either side and always find its source.”*
Thus, the noble man seeks to attain it himself. This is the one who embodies the Dao/Way, turning inward to find it within.

Quoted from the *Língbǎo Wúliàngdù Rén Jīng* [“*Scripture of the Soul’s Infinite Liberation*”], Upper Scroll:
*“Equal in compassion, differing in form yet united in kinship—when the realm is secure and the people prosperous, all rejoice in great peace.”*
This speaks of the sage-ruler, to whom all people flock without harm, all joyfully finding ease and peace.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng*:**
When balanced, there is no peril of steepness or decline.
Quoted from the *Yì Jìshí* [“*Appended Statements of the *Yì* [‘*Changes*’]*”]:
The *Yì* says: *“Without balance, there is no decline—decline is the result of imbalance.”*
Music and bait—even travelers will stop.

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng*:**
The *Zhuāngzǐ* records: North Gate Cheng questioned the Yellow Emperor, saying:
*“Your Majesty displayed the music of Xiánchí in the wilds of Dòngtíng.”*
Quoted from the *Zhuāngzǐ*—**Section on Heaven’s Design**—
North Gate Cheng, a subject of the Yellow Emperor, sought to elucidate the Dao of supreme music, thus engaging these two in dialogue.
Xiánchí, a name for music. *Zhang*, to perform. *Xián* is harmony. Dòngtíng’s wilds refer to the space between Heaven and Earth—not the lake Dòngtíng.
*Yù*, to retreat in weariness. *Zú*, to conclude. *Fù*, to repeat. *Huò*, to be confused. *Bù wù*, not to awaken to supreme music.
At first hearing, one is startled in fear.
Upon hearing it again, one gradually grasps its meaning, so fear retreats in weariness.
At last hearing, one knows supreme music—harmonizing with the Two Forces, sight and hearing vanish, the mind undivided, like one in darkness and confusion.
Gentle and even, without bias, silent and without knowing, lost in seated forgetfulness—self and objects both forgotten—this is *zuòwáng* [“seated forgetfulness”].

**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng*:**
When the people of Qi suffered famine, Qián’áo prepared food by the roadside to feed the hungry.
A starving man, sleeves tucked and sandals worn, came shuffling in exchange—Qián’áo held food in his left hand and drink in his right, saying: *“Come, eat!”*
The man raised his brows and glared, saying: *“I would rather starve to death than accept food given with such contempt.”*
Quoted from the *Mèngzǐ*—**Scroll of Dialogues with Gào Zǐ, Upper**—
Mencius said: *“A single basket of rice, a single bowl of soup—if obtained, one lives; if not, one dies. If given with a sneer, even a wayfarer would refuse it. If given with a kick, even a beggar would scorn it.”*
Zhū Xī’s annotation: *Dòu*, a wooden vessel. *Hūtuò*, the sound of spitting. *Xíngdào zhī rén*, an ordinary traveler.

「**Zhū Xī’s annotations:**
*Cù*, to trample or tread upon. *Qǐrén*, the beggar. *Bùxiè*, not deeming it pure or worthy. Though the hunger is dire, yet he still abhors rudeness—there are those who would rather die than eat from such contempt. This shows that the innate sense of shame and disgust in all people is stronger than the fear of death.

This passage shares similar meaning with the refusal of food given with a sneer, hence its inclusion as evidence. It illustrates that hunger is a grave affliction for man, yet when food is offered without respect, even travelers would refuse it, let alone beg for it. This is the rejection of food due to insufficient courtesy.

**Extended meaning:**
Zhuangzi said: *“Righteousness and justice are but the guesthouses of ancient kings—one may lodge there for a night, but cannot dwell long.”*
Quoted from the *Zhuangzi*—**Chapter on Heaven’s Destiny**—
*Schūlù*, guesthouses or inns. One cannot stay long.

To employ righteousness for universal love and justice to restrain wrongdoing—what is this but a temporary shelter, like lodging in an inn? It cannot be a lasting bond. The Daoist’s transformation of people is through the Way itself, enduring and tranquil. How could it be dispersed?

The Way’s expression is subtle, without taste. To look at it, one cannot see its form; to listen to it, one cannot hear its sound; to use it, one cannot exhaust its potential.

**Extended meaning:**
Liezi said: *“The form that shapes the form is substantial, yet the shaping of forms is not always present.”*
Quoted from the *Liezi*—**Chapter on Heaven’s Bountiful Grace**—
The meaning is already complete; no need to repeat it. This speaks of the efficacy of *wuwei* (non-action) aligning with the Way, its truth indeed boundless.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Principle of Inversion**
When one would gather, one must first let loose.
When one would weaken, one must first let grow strong.
When one would discard, one must first let flourish.
When one would take away, one must first give.
This is called *subtle illumination* (*wēimíng*).

**Extended meaning:**
The profound mysteries of the Sage are nowhere more exquisite than in the interplay of *power* (*quán*) and *substance* (*shí*).
Quoted from the *Tang* annotation by **Du Tian Shi** (Du the Master of the Tang):
The Sage’s teachings are divided into two paths—*power* and *substance*. The superior scholar, with keen insight, grasps the true essence of *substance*. The mediocre or lesser scholar must be guided through the path of *power*.

The methods of *power* are vast and adaptable. Following the scriptures, four key principles are outlined:
1. *“When one would gather, one must first let loose”*—this restrains the mind.
2. *“When one would weaken, one must first let grow strong”*—this restrains the nature.
3. *“When one would discard, one must first let flourish”*—this restrains desire.
4. *“When one would take away, one must first give”*—this restrains greed.

If the mind is restrained in its extravagance, the Way becomes harmonious.
If the mind is unrestrained, excess arises.
By fostering excess, one invites error, then reflecting, one returns to restraint.
This is the *power* of gathering the mind.

If the nature is weak, virtue is preserved whole.
If the nature is strong, calamity ensues.
By fostering strength, one invites calamity, then reflecting, one returns to weakness.
This is the *power* of subduing the nature’s strength.

If desire is few, conduct remains pure.
If desire is many, the spirit becomes turbid.
When desire deepens and turbidity reaches its extreme, one reflects and returns to purity.
This is the *power* of discarding desire and clarifying the spirit.

If one is not greedy, frugality prevails.
If greed is extreme, ruin befalls the body.
By fostering greed, one invites ruin, then reflecting, one returns to frugality.
This is the *power* of cultivating frugality to overcome greed.

All these methods first push to the utmost the unrestrained heart, so that it becomes entangled in avarice and desire, before guiding it back to its true nature and the Way.

At first glance, this may seem contrary to the principle of *wuwei* (self-transformation through non-action), but the nature varies in acuity, and enlightenment differs in gradual or sudden attainment. Those who attain sudden enlightenment need no guidance through *power*; those who progress gradually require skillful inducement. Thus arises the distinction between *power* and *substance*.

The Way and its teachings ultimately converge in great principle, hence it is said that *power* is precious in harmonizing meaning.

The petty man scorns *power*, and the Way is thereby accused of deceit. Hence, *power* cannot be lightly revealed to those who do not understand the Way.

The *Analects* say: *“One may be able to stand with [him], but not yet to employ *power* with [him].”* This speaks of the difficulty of using *power*.

**Extended meaning:**
This is how the Sage knows that when one treads upon frost, the coming of solid ice is near.
Quoted from the *Zhouyi*—**Hexagram *Kūn* (The Receptive)**—
**Line One:** *Treading upon frost, solid ice comes.*

This refers to the subtle *yin* energy of the first line, like the beginning of cold, yet by gradually accumulating its presence, solid ice forms. Though the Way initially appears soft and yielding, its gradual accumulation leads to firmness and strength.

**Extended meaning:**
Gōu Jiàn (勾践) sought to weaken the state of Wu, yet he urged them to attack Qi.
Quoted from the *Shiji* (Records of the Grand Historian):
**Confucius in Wei**, hearing that **Tiān Cháng** (田常) of Qi sought to create chaos, told his disciples: *“I cannot bear to see my ancestral homeland suffer at the hands of an enemy.”*

Now I desire to humble my stance before **Tiān Cháng** (田常) to save **Lǚ** (鲁), yet who shall I send as an envoy?

Zǐ Gòng (子贡) volunteered to serve as the envoy. The Master (夫子) consented.

Thus, he went to Qi (齐) and persuaded **Tiān Cháng** to delay his troops. "I will seek aid from Wu (吴) to save Lǚ, but now I ask you to attack Qi (齐) while Wu's forces welcome you." **Tiān Cháng** agreed.

Zǐ Gòng then went south to persuade the **Wu King** (吴王), saying: *"In name, we save Lǚ, but in truth, we aim to constrain the powerful state of Qi. By aiding Lǚ and attacking Qi, our prestige shall extend to the Jin state (晋国). The other lords will surely follow suit and pay homage, and the hegemonic enterprise will flourish."*

The **Wu King** then dispatched Zǐ Gòng to the **Yue** (越). Zǐ Gòng said: *"Wu has persuaded our king to aid Lǚ and attack Qi, yet their true intent is to weaken Yue. The Wu King desires this but fears Yue."*

**Gōu Jiàn** (勾践) bowed his head to the ground and said: *"I, the humble one, have always been unprepared for strength, yet I dared to oppose Wu (吴). I was constrained at **Kuài Jī** (会稽), my suffering piercing to the marrow, my lips and tongue parched day and night. I only wished to follow the Wu King to death in his footsteps—that was my earnest desire. Now, if you, my great minister, would kindly inform me of the advantages and harms, I would be most grateful."*

Zǐ Gòng said: *"The Wu King is a fierce and violent man. His ministers cannot endure him, and his state is exhausted. This is the opportune moment to retaliate against him."*

The **Yue King** (越王) **Gōu Jiàn** (勾践) then sent his minister **Wén Zhǒng** (文种) to bow before the Wu King and say: *"Yue offers all three thousand warriors within its borders to serve Wu."*

The Wu King accepted the **Yue King’s** terms, pardoned **Gōu Jiàn** (勾践), and allowed him to remain. He then mobilized his own troops to attack Qi and defeated them.

Zǐ Gòng then went north to see the **Jin Lord** (晋君). *"Now that Qi is weakened, Wu and Jin shall meet at **Huáng Pó** (黄池)."* The **Yue King** (越王) seized the opportunity to attack Wu (吴). The Wu King returned and fought against Yue, but was annihilated.

The **Master** (孔子) said: *"If one could indeed disrupt Qi to save Lǚ, that was my initial wish. If they could further strengthen Jin to weaken Wu, and if Wu were to perish while Yue became hegemon—that was Zǐ Gòng’s strategy. Yet, ‘beautiful words harm sincerity; be cautious with speech.’"*

**Extended meaning:**
The **Qi King** (齐桓公) loved delicacies, and **Yì Yá** (易牙) cooked his own son to please him.
The **Yu Lord** (虞君) loved treasures, and the **Jin King** (晋献公) used a **carriage of horses** (璧马) to lure him.
The **Hu Lord** (胡王) loved music, and the **Qin King** (秦穆公) enticed him with female musicians.

Quoted from the *Huáinánzǐ*—**Section *Zhǔshù* (主术训)**—
The *Hóngliè Jiě* (鸿烈解) states: *"The Qi King loved delicacies, and Yì Yá cooked his own son to please him."* According to the *Shiji*—**Qi Family History** (齐世家)—
Initially, the **Qi King** (齐桓公) had three wives, yet none bore him children. He indulged in concubines, numbering six like his wives, with the eldest being **Wèi Jī** (卫姬), who bore **Wú Kuī** (无亏). The younger **Wèi Jī** bore **Huì Gōng** (惠公元). **Zhèng Jī** (郑姬) bore **Xiào Gōng** (孝公昭). **Gě Yíng** (葛嬴) bore **Zhāo Gōng** (昭公潘). **Mì Jī** (密姬) bore **Yì Gōng** (懿公商人). **Sòng Huá Zǐ** (宋华子), as **Jiá Qí** (贾逵) said, was the daughter of the **Sòng Huá** (宋华) clan, of the **Zǐ** (子) lineage, and bore **Gōng Zǐ Yōng** (公子雍). **Yōng** (雍) was the chief of the **Yōng** (雍) officials, who served at the **Master’s** (桓公) table. There were inner and outer **Yōng** officials, and this man was named **Chéng** (丞) for the **Yōng** (雍) office—**Yì Yá** (易牙) was he. Through the eunuch **Shù Dāo** (竖刁), he offered lavish gifts to the **Qi King**, gaining favor. The **Qi King** granted his request.

Once **Yì Yá** (易牙) gained the **Qi King’s** favor, he petitioned for the eldest **Wèi Jī** (卫姬) to establish **Wú Kuī** (无亏) as heir. **Guān Zhòng** (管仲) fell ill, and the **Qi King** asked: *"Among my ministers, who is capable of succeeding you?"* **Guān Zhòng** replied: *"No one knows his subjects better than the ruler."* The **Qi King** asked: *"What of **Yì Yá** (易牙)?"* He answered: *"He killed his own son to please you—this is not human nature, and he cannot be trusted."* The **Qi King** asked: *"What of **Kāifāng** (开方)?"* He answered: *"He abandoned his own son, the crown prince of a thousand chariots, to serve you—this is not human nature, and he is hard to approach."* **Kāifāng** (开方) was the **Qi King’s** son, who had removed the crown prince of a thousand chariots and submitted himself to his father.

The **Qi King** asked: *"What of **Gōng Zǐ Shù Dāo** (公子竖刁)?"* He answered: *"He castrated himself to serve you—this is not human nature, and he is hard to trust."*

When **Guān Zhòng** (管仲) died, the **Qi King** did not heed his warnings and ultimately relied on these three men. The three men held absolute power—this is what is meant by **Yì Yá** (易牙) cooking his own son to ingratiate himself with the **Qi King**.

The **Yu Lord** (虞君) loved treasures, and the **Jin King** (晋献公) used a **carriage of horses** (璧马) to lure him. According to the *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋), **Lí Gōng** (僖公) in the second year said:
**Jìn Gǒu Xī** (晋苟息) requested to use the **carriage of horses** from **Qú** (屈产) and the **jewel of Chuí Jié** (垂棘) to borrow passage through **Yu** (虞) and attack **Huò** (虢). **Xún Xī** (荀息) was **Xún Shù** (荀叔). **Qú** (屈) produced fine horses, and **Chuí Jié** (垂棘) yielded beautiful jade—thus their names. Four horses make a **carriage** (乘). The path from Jin to Huò passed through Yu, so passage was requested.

The **Jin King** said: *"These are my treasures."* **Xún Xī** replied: *"If you gain passage through Yu, it is like possessing an outer granary."* The **Jin King** said: *"**Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) remains there."* **Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) was a loyal minister of Yu. **Xún Xī** replied: *"**Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) is a weak man who cannot give strong advice. Moreover, he is younger than you, and you favor him. Even if he advises you, you will not listen."*

The **Jin King** did not heed **Míng Zhī Qí**’s warnings. He then borrowed passage through Yu to attack Huò, and **Xún Xī** (荀息) offered rich gifts to win favor. **Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) advised against it, but was not listened to. Jin’s army then destroyed **Xià Yáng** (下阳).

In the fifth year, the **Jin King** again borrowed passage through Yu to attack Huò. **Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) advised him: *"Yu and Huò are neighbors. If Huò falls, Yu will surely follow. Jin cannot be provoked, nor can an enemy be trifled with. To do this once is already too much—how can it be done twice?"* The proverb says: *"Like a carriage and its axle, or lips and teeth—if one perishes, the other cannot survive."* This refers to Yu and Huò.

The **Yu King** (虞公) did not listen. In the twelfth month of winter, on the first day of the new moon (**Gěng Zǐ** 丙子), Jin destroyed Huò. The **Huò King** (虢公), **Chǒu** (丑), fled to the capital of **Jīng** (京师). Jin’s army returned and camped in Yu, then attacked and annihilated it. They captured the **Yu King** (虞公) and his ministers, including **Bó** (伯), and used them to humiliate **Qín Mù Gōng** (秦穆公)’s daughter, who was sent as a **bride** (媵).

The **Hu Lord** (胡王) loved music, and the **Qin King** (秦穆公) enticed him with female musicians. According to the *Shiji*—**Qin Family History** (秦本纪)—
In the thirty-fourth year of **Qín Mù Gōng** (秦穆公), the **Róng King** (戎王) sent **Yóu Yú** (由余) to Qin.

Yóu Yú, whose lineage was originally from **Jìn**, fled and entered the **Róng**, yet he retained his ability to speak **Jìn’s tongue**. Having heard of **Qín Mù Gōng**’s virtue, the **Róng King** thus sent Yóu Yú to observe Qin.

At this, **Qín Mù Gōng** withdrew and consulted **Nèishǐ Liào** (内史廖), saying: *"I have heard that neighboring lands possess a sage—this is a cause for concern among rival states. Now Yóu Yú is virtuous, and he is my undoing. What shall I do with him?"*

**Nèishǐ Liào** replied: *"The **Róng King** dwells among the **Qún Nì** (群匿), and has yet to hear the sounds of the **Central States** (中国). Your Highness might try sending him female musicians, to disrupt his resolve, and then request Yóu Yú’s presence, to create distance between them. Retain him without sending him back, thus breaking his expectations. The **Róng King** will surely suspect him, and if there is discord between the king and his subject, he may be captured. Moreover, the **Róng King** loves music, and will surely neglect his governance."*

**Qín Mù Gōng** said: *"Excellent."* Then, he seated Yóu Yú on a curved couch, served him food with ceremonial vessels, and interrogated him thoroughly about the terrain and military strength of the **Róng**. Only afterward did he command **Nèishǐ Liào** to send the **Róng King** eight sets of female musicians. The **Róng King** received them and delighted in them, never returning for an entire year. Thus, Qin recalled Yóu Yú. He then advised, but the **Róng King** did not heed him. **Qín Mù Gōng** repeatedly sent envoys to entice Yóu Yú, who eventually departed and submitted.

**Qín Mù Gōng** treated him with guest courtesies and inquired about the strategy for attacking the **Róng**. In the thirty-seventh year, Qin employed Yóu Yú’s counsel to assault the **Róng King**, expanding its territory by twelve states and a thousand *lǐ*, and thus became the hegemon of the **Western Róng**.

This is how **Qín Mù Gōng** used female musicians to entice the **Hu Lord** (胡王).

Hence, **Xuán Tóng** cited this to illustrate how **Shè Zhāng** (歙张) wielded the power of attraction and repulsion in this manner.

**Yǎn Yì** (衍义) states: The **Master Zhuāng** (庄子) recounts how **Xu Nuóguǐ** (徐无鬼), surnamed Xu and given the name Nuóguǐ, a **recluse** (隐士) of **Wèi**, first attended to the **Wèi King’s** (魏武侯) dogs and horses, then spared his **spirit and form** (神形), and finally proposed matters of governance. This is the wisdom of one who understands the **art of attraction and repulsion** (歙张之权).

He excerpted the text from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Xu Nuóguǐ Chapter** (徐无鬼篇):

*"Xu Nuóguǐ, surnamed Xu and given the name Nuóguǐ, was a **recluse** (隐士) of **Wèi**. Through **Yú Shāng** (女商), he saw **Wèi Wǔhóu** (魏武侯). Yú Shāng, with the surname **Nǚ** (女) and given name **Shāng**, was a favored minister of **Wèi**. **Wèi Wǔhóu** was the son of **Wèi Wénhóu** (魏文侯), the eighth-generation descendant of **Bì Wàn** (毕万)."*

**Wèi Wǔhóu** addressed him, saying: *"Master, you must be weary. You endure the toil of the mountains and forests, and thus deign to see me, your humble subject."*

**Xu Nuóguǐ** replied: *"I toil for you, yet what toil do you endure for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your pleasures and aversions, your very essence and life will fall ill. If you suppress your desires and constrain your pleasures and aversions, your ears and eyes will suffer. I toil for you—what toil do you endure for me?"*

**Wèi Wǔhóu** remained silent, his expression aloof.

After a moment, **Xu Nuóguǐ** said: *"Let me speak of my observations of dogs. The lowest kind seeks only to fill its belly—that is the nature of a fox. The middle kind gazes at the sun, while the highest seems to have lost a part of itself. But even my observations of dogs pale beside my observations of horses. A straight horse aligns with the plumb line, a curved one with the hook, a square one with the carpenter’s square, a round one with the compass—that is the horse of a kingdom. Yet even that does not compare to the horse of the world.

The horse of the world, when it has reached its peak, is like one who fears and trembles. If it stumbles, if it seems to lose a part of itself—such a horse transcends dust, leaving no trace, its whereabouts unknown."*

**Wèi Wǔhóu** was overjoyed and laughed aloud.

As **Xu Nuóguǐ** departed, **Yú Shāng** said: *"Master, how did you so delight our lord?"*

*"Those who counsel our lord,"* replied **Xu Nuóguǐ**, *"speak to him of *shī* and *shū*, of *lǐ* and *yuè* when addressing him from afar, or of *Jīnbǎn Liùtāo* and *Jīnbǎn Liùwéi*—these are titles from the *Zhōu Shū*. They also speak of *wénwǔ hǔbàolóngquǎn*, which is called *Lǚ Wàng’s Liùwéi*. Those who serve with great merit are countless, yet our lord has never opened his mouth to them. Today, how did you so delight our lord?"*

*"I spoke only of my observations of dogs and horses,"* said **Xu Nuóguǐ**.

*"Is that all?"* asked **Yú Shāng**.

*"Have you not heard of the exiled man of Yúe?"* he said. *"After a few days away from his homeland, he rejoices to see those he knows. After a month, he rejoices to see those he once saw at home. After a year, he rejoices even at the sight of one who resembles a man. Is it not that the longer one is distant from people, the deeper one’s longing for them becomes? The man who flees into emptiness clings to the narrow paths of *lídié*, stumbling through the void—yet when he hears the sound of footsteps approaching, he rejoices. How much more so when he hears the cough of kin or loved ones at his side! For long have none spoken the words of the True Person to our lord, their voices coughing beside him. This is how one must first strike the chord before speaking of governance—then he will surely take delight. This too is the art of attraction and repulsion."*

Thus **Xuán Tóng** recorded this to illustrate the principle.

*"The soft overcomes the hard. Fish cannot be dragged from the depths, and the sharpest tools of a kingdom must not be displayed to the people."*

**Corollary:** *"Just as fish cannot be dragged from the depths—for if they were, they would be caught. I excerpt from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Gēngsāng Chú Chapter**:*

*The beasts of the wicker carriage, if they break free and climb the mountains, will not escape the nets. The fish that swallows a boat, if it is stranded and loses the water, even ants will torment it. Thus birds and beasts do not tire of heights, and fish and turtles do not tire of depths. Is this not what is meant?"*

**Corollary:** *"This is called *dúhuà*—self-so transformation."*

I excerpt from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Zài Yòu Chapter**: *"The man of singular possession—this is called the utmost nobility."*

This speaks of the man of singular possession, whom the people gladly follow, whom the masses bear aloft, whom they would make their lord—not merely the utmost nobility, but the utmost reverence.

From the *Dà Zōngshī Chapter*: *"Only when the morning is clear can one see the singular. Only when one sees the singular can one transcend past and future. To follow the ceaseless renewal of the Transforming, to move with the ever-changing and yet never be swayed by things—this is called *dúhuà*."*

**Corollary:** *"The *Yì* says: *‘Sūn proceeds by exercising influence.’* I excerpt from the *Yì Jìshī*:*

*‘Sūn proceeds by exercising influence’—this means compliance. To act in accordance with the times and suit the occasion is to exercise influence. If one does not comply with the times and adapt to change, one cannot exercise influence."*

**Corollary:** *"To fish, one must use the right bait."*

I excerpt from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Xu Nuóguǐ Chapter**: *"Thus the True Person detests the multitude, for the multitude brings discord, and discord brings harm. Therefore, he has no particular favorites, no particular estrangements. Embracing virtue and harmony, he aligns with the Dao of the world—this is the True Person."*

*"To ants, knowledge is discarded; to fish, strategy is found; to sheep, intention is abandoned.*

**Explication:** *One who does not covet mutton discards knowledge for ants. One who does not teach others through the stench of mutton abandons intention for sheep. Having cast aside *rén* and *yì* in harmony with the Ultimate Way, unharmed and forgotten in the rivers and lakes, thus to fish, strategy is found—this is why these words censure Yú Shùn’s teaching through the stench of mutton."*

**End of handwritten notes from *Yàodé Zhēnjīng Yǎnyì*, Volume Nine. Beginning of Volume Ten.**

**Five-Peak Hermit Wang Shouzheng’s Collected Works**
**Chapter Thirty-Seventh: The Dao Ever Does Without Doing**

The Dao ever does without doing, yet nothing remains undone.
*The Yanyi* explains: The Dao’s constant is non-action.
[Quoted from *Zhuangzi*’s *Tian Di* chapter.]

Thus it is said:
The ancients who nurtured the world—
without desire, the world was sufficient;
without doing, all things transformed.

Again it is said:
To do without doing is called Heaven;
to speak without speaking is called virtue.
*The Yanyi* explains: Few are the virtuous in the world, many the unvirtuous.
[Quoted from *Zhuangzi*’s *Qū Qìe* chapter—
the words of the robber Zhí answering his followers.]

From this, it is clear:
The virtuous cannot stand without the Sage’s Dao,
nor can Zhí act without it.
Few are the virtuous in the world, many the unvirtuous—
thus the Sage’s benefit to the world is little,
while his harm to it is great.

**Chapter Thirty-Eighth: The Supreme Virtue Does Not Claim Virtue**

The supreme virtue does not claim virtue,
and thus has virtue.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue,
and thus has no virtue.

*The Yanyi* explains: *Zhīlí*’s actions—
the people use them daily yet know them not.
[Quoted:] *Zhīlí*’s actions—
his virtue is disjointed, fractured, and scattered,
not displaying its function, not revealing its name’s meaning.

From *Zhuangzi*’s *Ren Jian Shi* chapter:
*Zhīlí* the crippled—
his chin hid in his navel, his shoulders higher than his neck,
his hair tied upward, pointing to Heaven.
Five orifices above—
the five orifices, the five viscera.
His thighs served as ribs.
He sharpened needles, mended nets,
sewed clothes, and cleaned courtyards—
enough to fill his belly.
He divined with tally sticks and milfoil stalks.

**The Scattered Virtue**

Sowing seeds, enough to feed ten people.
When the ruler summoned warriors, *Zhīlí* would bare his arms among them.
When the ruler imposed great labor, *Zhīlí* would refuse work due to his chronic illness.
When the ruler gave grain to the sick, *Zhīlí* would accept three *zhōng* of six *shí*, four *dòu*—a *zhōng*—and ten bundles of firewood.
Though *Zhīlí*’s body was disjointed,
still he was able to nourish himself,
and live out his natural years—
how much more so for one whose virtue was scattered!

If one could preserve his original Dao,
thus, the people use it daily yet know it not.

*The Yì Xìyì* states:
One yin and one yang—the Dao.
To follow it is good.
To complete it is nature.
The benevolent see it and call it benevolence,
the wise see it and call it wisdom.
The people use it daily yet know it not,
thus the Dao of the noble is rare.
This is the Way of supreme virtue,
which does not claim virtue,
and thus the people use it daily yet know it not.

When the ruler performed rites and there was no response,
he would bare his arms and press forward.
*The Yanyi* explains:
Rites are to be followed—
to be practiced and enacted.
They distinguish the high and low,
and establish noble and ignoble.

*The Yì Lǚ Guà Dàxiàng* states:
Above, Heaven; below, the marshes—
the *Lǚ* hexagram.
The noble one uses it to distinguish the high and low,
and settle the people’s intentions.

*The Yanyi* explains:
Jade and silk exchanged in procession,
and dignified bearing in response.
*The Lǘ Yǔ* (from the *Yáng Huò* chapter) states:
Confucius said:
“Rites, rites—
is it jade and silk that is spoken of?
Music, music—
is it bells and drums that is spoken of?”

*The Lǐjì* (from the *Zhōngyōng* chapter) states:
Three hundred rites of decorum,
three thousand dignities of bearing—
in one word, it may be summed:
Do not fail in reverence.

Rites are rooted in reverence,
music in harmony.
That which commands awe is dignity,
that which sets the example is decorum.
Jade and silk are the implements of rites,
to express their intent.
Bells and drums are the instruments of music,
to guide its harmony.
Thus, reverence within harmony—
this is the foundation of rites and music.
Bells and drums—
this is the superficial aspect of rites and music.

Hence it is said:
Jade and silk exchanged in procession,
dignified bearing in response,
uplifted hands, bowed arms, clenched fists—
advancing and retreating with measured glances and gestures—
this is the outward form of rites.
Thus, when the superficial rites are met with no response,
it reaches the point of bared arms and pressing forward.

*The Yanyi* explains:
Uplifted hands, bowed arms, clenched fists—
this is the ritual of a subject.
*Uplifted*—interlaced hands.
*Bowed arms*—kneeling with bent knees.
*Clenched fists*—bent waist.

*The Zhuangzi* (from the *Dà Zōngshī* chapter) states:
The noble one uses rites as his wings,
to move through the world.
Since it is said that great rites align with Heaven and Earth,
and that rites are used as wings to move through the world,
how could there be such disorder as bared arms and pressing forward?

*The Yanyi* explains:
To come without returning is not rites.
To return without coming is also not rites.

*The Lǐjì* states:
This is the way rites distinguish high and low,
and separate near and distant.

*Bared arms*—to roll up sleeves and bare arms,
then press forward and tug—
this is the ritual of response and reciprocity.
When one acts thus and receives no response,
then in anger he presses forward and tugs.

*The Yanyi* explains:
A single word unanswered,
a single bow unreturned—
two states would become desolate,
then one would bare his arms and press forward.

*The Chūnqiū* (from the *Xuān Gōng* year twelve) states:
The Duke of Chu again sent envoys to seek alliance with Jin,
and the people of Jin agreed.
The Duke of Chu said:
“This is not within your knowledge.”

King Wu conquered Shang and composed a hymn:
*"To pacify the myriad states and ensure abundant harvests."*

The Way of **virtue/power** (武) restrains violence and ceases war,
preserves the great and stabilizes achievements,
settles the people and harmonizes the masses,
and enriches wealth—
this is its **virtue/power** (德).
Thus, he commands his descendants never to forget its principles.
Now, I have caused the two states to suffer desolation and violence.
Today, I wage a single battle and leave the people of Jin and Chu as desolate bones in the wild—
this is the failure to restrain violence.

*The Yanyi* further expounds:
During the Spring and Autumn period, the Duke of Chu (宣王) courted the feudal lords,
and the records of *rites* (义) were fully documented.

It is also said:
In the age of **ultimate virtue/power** (至德), one acts sincerely without knowing it as loyalty.
*The Yanyi* cites the words from the *Zhuangzi*—[*Xuan Tian Di* §] (天地篇):
In the age of **ultimate virtue/power** (至德),
one does not exalt the worthy,
nor employ the capable.
The ruler is like a tree trunk,
the people like wild deer.
One acts upright without knowing it as **rites** (义),
loves one another without knowing it as **benevolence** (仁),
acts sincerely without knowing it as loyalty,
responds appropriately without knowing it as **trustworthiness** (信),
and moves in harmony without considering it as a gift.
Thus, the true **Daoist** (大丈夫) dwells in its substance,
not in its superficiality.
He resides in its reality,
not in its embellishments.
Therefore, he abandons that and takes this.

*The Yanyi* further expounds:
This is why the scholars of Jin and Song indulge recklessly and forget restraint—
until their states collapse and they perish without knowing it.

*The Yanyi* cites:
During the era of **Sima Zhao** (司马昭), three years passed,
and **Qi Kang** (嵇康) of **Jiao Prefecture** (樵郡)
was renowned for his grand and splendid literary style,
fond of discussing the *Zhuangzi* and *Laozi*,
yet also valuing the odd and the chivalrous.
He was closely acquainted with **Ruan Ji** (阮籍) of **Chenliu** (陈留),
his brother **Ruan Xuan** (阮咸),
**Shan Tao** (山涛) of **Hejin** (河内),
**Xiang Xiu** (向秀) of **Henan** (河南),
**Wang Rong** (王戎) of **Langye** (琅琊),
and **Liu Ling** (刘伶) of **Pei** (沛).
Together, they were called the **Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove** (竹林七贤),
all embracing emptiness,
despising rites and laws,
indulging in wine and revelry,
and neglecting worldly affairs.
**Zhong Hui** (锺会), favored by **Sima Zhao**,
heard of **Qi Kang**’s reputation and visited him.
**Qi Kang** sat cross-legged, his sleeves rolled up,
and did not rise to greet him.
Hui was about to leave.
**Qi Kang** asked:
“What have you heard that brought you here?
What have you seen that makes you leave?”
Hui replied:
“I have heard what I heard and seen what I saw.”
**Qi Kang** deeply resented him.
**Shan Tao**, serving as a **Briefing Department Officer** (吏部郎),
recommended **Qi Kang** to replace himself.
**Qi Kang** wrote to him:
“You claim I am unfit for the common world,
yet you do not denigrate the **virtue/power** (德) of the **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors** (汤武).”
**Sima Zhao** heard this and grew angry.
**Qi Kang** was close friends with **Lü An** (吕安) of **Dongping** (东平),
so **Zhong Hui** slandered them,
saying that **Lü An** and **Qi Kang** had great reputations
yet their discussions were licentious,
and they disturbed the times and corrupted teachings,
making it appropriate to eliminate them.
Thus, **Lü An** and **Qi Kang** were executed.
This is cited as proof—
indeed, the reckless forget restraint,
and thus their states collapse and they perish without knowing it.

*The Yanyi* cites the *Southern History*—[*Song Dynasty Records* §] (宋纪):
**Xie Lingyun** (谢灵运), of **Yangxia** (阳夏) in **Chen Prefecture** (陈郡),
was the son of **Xie Ying** (谢瑛), the **Secretary of the Imperial Library** (秘书郎).
He was appointed **Prefect of Yongjia** (永嘉太守).
The prefecture had famed mountains and waters,
which **Xie Lingyun** had always loved.
Since he could not fulfill his ambitions as prefect,
he indulged in unrestrained wanderings,
visiting every county,
often staying beyond the prescribed terms.
He no longer cared for governing or hearing cases.
Wherever he went, he composed poems to express his thoughts.
After one year in Yongjia,
he feigned illness and resigned his post,
then moved to **Kuiji** (会稽),
restoring his old estates,
adjoining mountains and rivers,
and enjoying the finest secluded residences.
He consorted with the recluse **Wang Hongzhi** (王弘之),
**Zha Chun** (扎淳之), and others,
indulging in licentious pleasures,
with the intention of ending his days there.
From **Shi Ning** (始宁) in the **Southern Mountains** (南山),
he began clearing paths and cutting trees,
until he reached **Linhai** (临海), with hundreds following him.
The **Prefect of Linhai** (临海太守), **Wang Zhu** (王珠),
was alarmed and thought them bandits.

*The Yanyi* says:
The **Xie** (谢) family, since the **Jin Dynasty** (晋),
has passed down the **Dao of elegance** (雅道).
**Xie Jing** (景恒) and **Xie Jingren** (景仁)
were renowned for their **virtue/power** (德) and substance (素).
**Xie Jingmao** (景懋) and **Xie Jingxian** (景先)
were praised for their integrity (节) and elegance (美).
**Xie Fang** (方明) upheld the standards of conduct (行已之度),
and **Xie Xuanhui** (玄晖) excelled in literary brilliance (藻续之奇).
Each dominated their time,
and they can truly be called a **house of virtue** (德门).
**Xie Lingyun**’s talent and fame were unparalleled in the **Jiangzuo** (江左) region,
yet he alone grew reckless without restraint,
leading to his own downfall.
People have their own strengths,
but this is indeed the truth—
alas, what a pity.

*The Yanyi* cites *The Chapter on the One from Ancient Times* (昔之得一章, third ninth):
Those who obtained **the One** (一) in ancient times—
**Heaven** (天) obtained **the One** and was clear.
**Earth** (地) obtained **the One** and was tranquil.
**The Spirit** (神) obtained **the One** and was responsive.
**The Valley** (谷) obtained **the One** and was full.
All things obtained **the One** and thus were born.
The feudal lords and kings obtained **the One**,
and thus became the **rightful rulers of the world** (天下正).

*The Yanyi* further expounds:
It cites the original scripture:
*The Dao* generates **the One** (一). For things, **the One** is their **vital essence** (精).
**Primordial Qi** (元气) is the child of *The Dao*.
**Primordial Qi** is the **subtle and harmonious essence** (冲和之妙气).
It becomes the foundation of **Yin and Yang** (阴阳),
the mother of all things,
unchanging from ancient to modern,
endless from beginning to end.
How vast is **the One** (一)!

**The One** is **Primordial Qi** (元气).
It can manifest as **Yin** (阴) and **Yang** (阳),
yet does not belong to **Yin and Yang**,
ascending to the **Jade Capital and Golden Gates** (玉京金阙)
without becoming pure.
Dwelling in **clay tiles, thatch, and coarse mats** (瓦甓茅薜),
it does not become impure.
**The Heavenly Primordial** (乾元) relies on it for its beginning,
**The Earthly Primordial** (坤元) relies on it for its growth.
When **the Sovereign** (制御) acts with purpose,
then **the True Ruler** (真宰) emerges.

*The Yanyi* further expounds:
It refers to **the True Sovereign** (真君) as the one who governs the form,
and **the True Ruler** (真宰) as the one who governs the body.
*The Yanyi* cites the *Zhuangzi*—[*Qiwu Lun* §] (齐物论):
Without that, there is no self.
Without self, there is nothing to take.
Yet it is close at hand,
and one does not use it to act.
If there is a **True Ruler** (真宰),
yet one cannot discern its traces (朕),
then all would have ministers and servants.
Their ministers and servants would be insufficient to govern them.
They would alternately become rulers and ministers.
Yet there is a **True Sovereign** (真君) who truly exists.
Whether one finds its essence or not,
it neither benefits nor harms its true nature.

*The Yanyi* further expounds:
The five ranks of feudal lords—
**Kings** (侯王) are the **highest rank** (五等之爵).
The **King** (王) is the **Sovereign of the Four Seas** (四海之尊).
The **Marquis** (侯) is the second rank among the five.
Indeed, the five ranks were established,
with **Duke** (公), **Marquis** (侯), **Earl** (伯), **Viscount** (子), and **Baron** (男),
to assist the **King** (王者).

The **King** (王) is the **Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Chariots** (万乘之君).
**Sovereign** (君) refers to the **King** (王),
the **Son of Heaven** (天子).
The **Son of Heaven** holds the **sealed lands of a hundred thousand households** (提封百万赋),
and **sixty-four thousand wells** (六十四万井).
He issues **a hundred thousand warhorses** (戎马百万匹),
and **ten thousand chariots of war** (兵车万乘),
thus he is called the **Lord of the Ten Thousand Chariots** (万乘之主).

「Thus, the **feudal lords** (侯王) can **permanently hold the Mandate of Heaven** (永有天下), with none failing to submit (无思不服).
　　**Explication:** The phrase *"none failing to submit"* (无思不服) appears in the *"Mao Poems"* (《毛诗_), specifically in the *"Great Odes"* (□大雅)—the *"King Wen’s Resounding Virtue"* (文王有声篇), where it states:
*"At Hao, King Wu established his capital and cleared the festering sores [of the land],
offering rites from the west, from the east, from the south, from the north—
none failing to submit (无思不服)."*
　　*"None failing to submit (无思不服), the august **Sovereign** (皇王) shines forth!"*
　　It speaks of **King Wu** establishing his domain at **Hao** (镐京).
　　**Commentary:** *"From"* (自) means *"by"* or *"through"* (由), indicating that **King Wu** at **Hao** (镐京) performed the **clearing of festering sores** (辟痈) ritual, and all came from the four quarters to witness.
All were moved by **King Wu’s virtue and transformation** (德化), their hearts without fail submitting to him.

　　It further states: *"The august **Sovereign** shines forth!"* (皇王烝哉).
*"August"* (皇) means *"great"* (大), *"shines forth"* (烝) means *"to rule"* (君).
This refers to the **greatness of King Wu’s virtue and transformation** (德化大), allowing him to rule (君) throughout the ages.

　　Now, this passage is cited to prove that when the **feudal lords** attain **Oneness** (一) and align with it (正), all **ten thousand states** (万国) rejoice and submit.
Thus, it is said: *"The **feudal lords** who attain **Oneness** (侯王得一) set it as the standard for all under Heaven (以为天下正)."*

　　The consequences of failing to achieve this are dire:
If the **Way** (道) is not upheld, **Heaven** (天) will fear to remain clear (清), and may split asunder (裂).
If the **Way** is not aligned, the **Earth** (地) will fear to remain at peace (宁), and may erupt (发).
If the **Way** is not perfected, the **Spirit** (神) will fear to remain responsive (灵), and may grow dormant (歇).
If the **Way** is not sustained, the **valleys** (谷) will fear to remain full (盈), and may run dry (竭).
If the **Way** is not upheld, **all things** (万物) will fear to thrive (生), and may face extinction (灭).
If the **feudal lords** fail to attain **Oneness**, they may fear losing their exalted status (贵高), and their rule may falter (蹶).

　　**Explication:** *"The **Lingzhi** (《列子》) records that a man from **Qi State** (杞国) worried that Heaven and Earth would collapse and perish, leaving no place for his body to rest."*

　　**Annotation from *Lingzhi’s* "Heaven’s Bounties" (□天瑞篇):**
*"In **Qi State** (杞国), there was a man. **King Tang of Yin** (殷汤) granted the **descendant of Xia** (夏后) the land of **Qi**, and the **Zhou** (周) later reaffirmed this grant.
Now, it lies within **Chenliu County, Yongqiu** (陈留雍丘县), which is the territory of **Qi Prefecture** (杞州) today."*

　　*(The **Explication** already contains this record, so it is not repeated here.)*

　　Therefore, **exalted status** (贵) must be grounded in **humility** (贱), and **height** (高) must be rooted in **lowliness** (基).
Hence, the **feudal lords** (侯王) refer to themselves as *"the lone one"* (孤), *"the few"* (寡), or *"not the grain"* (不谷)—
this is their way of grounding themselves in humility (以贱为本), is it not?
Indeed, it is not so.

　　**Explication:** The phrase *"the lone one"* (孤) appears in the *"Left Transmission"* (《左传》):
*"The lone one (孤) and his few ministers (二三臣) grieve in their hearts, their plans in disarray (失图).
The **Altar of the State** (社稷) is not secure (遑), how much less could they cherish and ponder the **virtue of their Sovereign** (君德)."*

　　**Annotation:** In the *"Spring and Autumn Annals"* (《春秋》), during the **seventh year of Duke Zhao** (昭公七年), the **King of Chu** (楚子) built the **Chengfang Terrace** (成章华之台) and wished to share it with the **feudal lords** (诸侯).
To uphold this tradition, he dared not let it fall into ruin (弗敢失陨坠), and so summoned the **ancestral spirits** (诸宗桃), saying:
*"My **ancestral Sovereign**, **King Gong** (恭王), stretched his neck and gazed northward,
longing for the **Sun and Moon** (日月) to fulfill his hopes (以冀).
He passed down his **Mandate** (序) and entrusted it (相授).
To this day, there have been four **Sovereigns** (王) of Chu (四王矣)."*
These are **King Gong** (恭), **King Kang** (康), **King Jiao Ao** (郏敖), and **King Ling** (灵王).

*"Yet their blessings and grace (嘉惠) did not reach far,
only **Duke Xiang** (襄公) came to honor my funeral rites (临我丧)."*
*"The lone one (孤) and his few ministers (二三臣) grieve in their hearts, their plans in disarray (失图).
The **Altar of the State** (社稷) is not secure (遑), how much less could they cherish and ponder the **virtue of their Sovereign** (君德)."*
This refers to the **great mourning rites for King Kang** (康王大丧) being neglected, and **King Ling of Chu** (楚灵) lacking **trustworthiness** (信), thus his rule did not endure (不终).

　　**Explication:** The phrase *"the few"* (寡人) follows the precedent set by earlier **Sovereigns** (先君) who deemed themselves *"the few"* (寡人) as **virtuous** (贤).

　　**Annotation:** In the *"Spring and Autumn Annals"* (《春秋》), during the **third year of Duke Yin** (隐公三年), **Duke Xuan of Song** (宋宣公) abandoned his son **Yi** (与夷) and established his younger brother **Duke Mu** (穆公) as ruler.
When **Duke Mu** (穆公) fell ill, he summoned **Great Marshal Kong Fu** (大司马孔父) and entrusted him, saying:
*"My **ancestral Sovereign** (先君) abandoned his son **Yi** (与夷) and established **the few** (寡人) as ruler,
deeming **the few** (寡人) virtuous (为贤),
and commanding him to oversee the **Altar of the State** (社稷).
If **the few** (寡人) were to abandon **virtue** (德) and refuse to yield (不让),
and if **Yi** (与夷) were to succeed me (段后),
then when my **ancestral Sovereign** (先君) inquires of **Yi** (与夷),
what words would he use to respond?
I beg you, **Great Marshal Kong Fu** (子), to uphold this (奉之),
and oversee the **Altar of the State** (社稷).
Even if **the few** (寡人) were to die,
he would have no regrets (无悔焉)."*

　　**Explication:** The phrase *"not the grain"* (不谷) follows the precedent of **Duke Ling of Chu** (楚灵) condemning those who lack **perfected virtue** (成德).

　　**Annotation:** In the *"Spring and Autumn Annals"* (《春秋》), during the **eleventh year of Duke Cheng** (成公十一年), there was the **Orderfu Meeting** (令狐之会) between **Qin and Jin** (秦晋).
**Duke Li of Jin** (晋侯) arrived first, but **Qin’s Marquis** (秦伯) refused to cross the **River Fen** (河).
These were **Duke Li of Jin** (晋厉公) and **Qin’s Marquis Huan** (秦桓公).

*"Qin betrayed the Jin alliance (背晋盟),
and **Duke Li of Jin** sent **Lu’s Minister** (吕相) to sever ties with Qin (绝秦)."*
**Lu’s Minister** (吕相) questioned **Qin’s Marquis** (秦伯), saying:
*"The **people of Chu** (楚人) detest those who divide their **virtue** (德) into two or three (二三其德),
and they have come to inform us:
'Qin betrayed the **Orderfu Alliance** (令狐之盟),
yet now comes to seek a new alliance from us (来求盟于我).
We proclaim to **Heaven’s Emperor** (皇天上帝), **Qin’s Three Dukes** (秦三公), and **Chu’s Three Kings** (楚三王):
Though we have relations with Jin (余虽与晋出入),
we only seek our own advantage (余惟利是视).
**Not the grain** (不谷) detests those who lack **perfected virtue** (无成德),
and thus we declare this to warn against **disunity** (不一).'"*

The **Eleventh Scroll** of *Daoist Classics: Explication of the *Daodejing* by Lingzhi* (《道德真经衍义手钞卷》) continues:

**Chapter Forty: "The Dao/Way's Movement Through Reversal" (反者道之动)**

The **Dao/Way's Movement Through Reversal**:
The *Lingzhi Explication of the *Yijing* (易复卦)* states: *"The strong reverses; moving yet proceeding with gentleness, thus entering and exiting without strain, companions arriving without blame."*

The *Lingzhi Abridgment of the *Yijing* (易经复卦众)* records: *"The *Fuxi* hexagram: Reversal, success. The strong reverses; moving yet proceeding with gentleness, thus entering and exiting without strain, companions arriving without blame."*

Wang Bi annotates: *"Entering is reversal, exiting is the growth of the strong; hence there is no strain."* Strain is akin to illness, companions refer to yang; hence it is said, *"Thus entering and exiting without strain, companions arriving without blame."*

The *Lingzhi Explication* states: *"Motionless and still, yet responding and thus communicating throughout the world."* This is from the *Zhouyi Xici* (周易系辞).

The *Yijing* (易) is without thought, without action. Motionless and still, yet responding and thus communicating throughout the world—what can be more sincere than this? Who else could attain this?

The *Lingzhi Explication* states: *"Gazing upward at Heaven, looking downward at Earth."* This is from the *Yijing Xici* (易系辞).

Wang Bi annotates: *"Thus it can fully expound the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth: gazing upward to observe celestial omens, looking downward to examine terrestrial geography. Hence one knows the principles of darkness and light. It begins with the original and ends with the terminal, thus understanding the sayings of death and life."*

The *Lingzhi Explication* states: *"Among the Five Phases, water reverses its flow, fully unified, and moves beneficially with the times."* This is from the *Liezi* (列子□黄帝篇).

The full meaning is already contained in the *Daodejing* (道经□内道冲章第四篇), so I shall not repeat the major points here. *"Reversing its flow, fully unified"* means that when water reverses, it aligns with the Dao/Way; when it is deep and still, it attains full unity. Laozi says: *"When the heart is good, it is deep and vast, empty and still, not mingling with things. Though the waves and currents may vary, the nature of the depths remains unchanged, and when it moves, it does so in perfect timing."* Hence it is said: *"Reversing its flow, fully unified, and moving beneficially with the times."*

**The Dao/Way's Use Through Weakness (弱者道之用)**

The *Lingzhi Explication* states: *"Pointing at me, you overcome me; stepping on me, you overcome me. Yet, as the wind travels, the boundless void can be said to be weak."* This is from the *Zhuangzi* (庄子□秋水篇).

The wind said: *"When I move your spine and ribs, there is a likeness. Yet now I rise from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea without any likeness—why is this?*
*The wind replied: *"Indeed. I rise from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea, yet when you point at me, I cannot bend your finger; when you step on me, I cannot bend your foot. This is the weakness of the small overcoming the small. I alone can uproot great trees and raise great houses, strike the vast expanse of the sea."*

The *Lingzhi Explication* states: *"Release it to the east, and it flows east; release it to the west, and it flows west. Thus, water entrusted to the boundless void can be said to be weak."* This is from the *Mengzi* (孟子□告子章句上).

Gaozi said: *"Human nature is like rushing water: released to the east, it flows east; released to the west, it flows west. Human nature’s lack of distinction between good and evil is like water’s lack of distinction between east and west."* Rush refers to the swirling and winding appearance of waves.

The *Lingzhi Explication* states: *"Liezi said: 'Form arises from the formless; thus how did Heaven and Earth come to be?'"* This is from the *Liezi* (列子□天瑞篇).

Liezi said: *"In ancient times, the Sage followed yin and yang to govern Heaven and Earth. The formless gives rise to form, thus how did Heaven and Earth come to be?*
*This refers to the greatest forms of Heaven and Earth. Yin and yang are not divine consciousness, yet form arises from the formless—does Heaven and Earth possess divine consciousness and innate nature? If they do not, then from where does it arise?"*
*This hypothetical question serves to illustrate that all things have their origin in the formless.*

**Chapter Forty-One: "The Superior Person Hears the Dao/Way" (上士闻道章)**

The superior person hears the Dao/Way and diligently practices it.
The middle person hears the Dao/Way and holds it uncertainly, as if it exists or does not exist.
The inferior person hears the Dao/Way and laughs at it.
If one does not laugh, it is not the Dao/Way.

The *Lingzhi Explication* states: *"Speaking to him and he does not grow weary—his response is like this."* This is from the *Lunyu* (论语□子罕第九).

The Master said: *"Speaking to him and he does not grow weary—his response is like this."* Fan Shi annotated: *"Yanzi heard the Master’s words and understood them with his mind, practicing them with his strength. In the midst of chaos or adversity, he never failed to follow them. Like all things receiving timely rain and nourishment, flourishing and growing, how could he grow weary? This is what the other disciples could not match."*

The *Lingzhi Explication* states: *"As in the *Lunyu* where one can speak to the superior and the inferior."* This is from the *Lunyu* (论语□雍也第六).

The Master said: *"Above the middle person, one can speak to him of the superior Dao/Way. Below the middle person, one cannot speak to him of the superior Dao/Way. This is because the quality of those below the middle person is such that if spoken to abruptly of things too lofty, not only can they not comprehend, but they will also presumptuously aspire to equal them, incurring the flaw of detachment from their own condition and ultimately remaining inferior."*

The *Lingzhi Explication* states: *"Like Zi Xia, who upon seeing the bustling splendor of the world rejoiced in returning, yet hearing the Master’s Dao/Way found joy in it."* This is from the *Shiji* (史记□礼书), where Zi Xia’s eminent disciple is recorded.

It is said: *"Upon seeing the bustling splendor of the world, he rejoiced in returning; yet hearing the Master’s Dao/Way, he found joy."* Both cases, his heart was conflicted and unable to decide itself, much less those below the middle person who are gradually steeped in losing the teachings and conforming to customs.

The *Lingzhi Explication* states: *"The eyes wish to see colors, the ears wish to hear sounds, the mouth wishes to discern flavors, the will and qi wish to be fulfilled."* This is from the *Zhuangzi*, in the dialogue between Daozi and Confucius.

Daozi said: *"Now I tell you: according to human desires, the eyes wish to see colors, the ears wish to hear sounds, the mouth wishes to discern flavors, the will and qi wish to be fulfilled."*

「A man’s lifespan may reach a hundred years at its best, eighty in the middle, and sixty at its worst. Yet even when excluding the days lost to sickness, emaciation, death, mourning, sorrow, and calamity, one may open their mouth in laughter no more than four or five times within a month.

Heaven and Earth are boundless, yet the eight deaths are limited in time. Wielding finite tools within the infinite expanse, one’s life passes swiftly—like a galloping *qí* (骐) and *jì* (骥) racing through a narrow gap. This is akin to the *zhāngfú* (章甫) hat being deemed worthless by the people of *Yuè* (越).

From the *Zhuangzi*’s *"You’re So Uplifted"* (逍遥游) chapter: *"A man of Sòng (宋) sold his *zhāngfú* hat as merchandise."* The *zhāngfú* was the ceremonial hat of *Zōu* (邹) and *Lǔ* (鲁). The people of *Yuè* (越), however, had the custom of cutting their hair and tattooing their bodies, prizing neither hats nor headgear. Thus, it was said that the *zhāngfú* was deemed worthless by the people of *Yuè*.

This is also like *Hé Pú* (和璞) being abandoned by the state of *Chǔ* (楚).

From the text: *Hé Pú* (和璞), whose given name was *Hé* (和) and surname *Biàn* (卞), was a man of *Chǔ* (楚). He dwelled beneath the *Jīng* (荆) Mountains, which lie in *Chǔ*’s territory and yield fine jade. *Biàn Hé* (卞和) found a jade *pú* (璞) and presented it to the *Chǔ* king. The king flew into a rage and had his left foot amputated. When the *Chǔ* king died and *Wǔ* (武) the king ascended the throne, *Hé* (和) presented the jade again. *Wǔ* the king said: *"You deceived my predecessor, and now I have had your right foot amputated."* *Hé* (和) embraced the jade and wept at the *Jīng* (荆) Mountains. When *Wǔ* the king died and *Chéng* (成) the king ascended the throne, *Hé* (和) once more sought to present the jade. *Chéng* the king ordered his ministers to carve it, and indeed it proved to be fine jade. Its value was beyond estimation.

This is also like saying: *"A rigid scholar cannot be spoken to about the Dao/Way."*

From the *Zhuangzi*: *"A rigid scholar cannot be spoken to about the Dao/Way."* This passage appears in *"Qīu Shuǐ"* (秋水), where it states: *"The fish of the Northern Sea cannot be spoken to about the ocean, for it is confined by the shallows. The summer insects cannot be spoken to about ice, for they are bound to their season. A rigid scholar cannot be spoken to about the Dao/Way, for he is enslaved by doctrine."* This implies that lesser scholars do not grasp the subtleties of the Dao/Way, and that to make them laugh is insufficient to reveal its true nature.

There are sayings to this effect: *"The Way of the Sage is like a valley, the great clarity like shame, the boundless virtue like insufficiency, the established virtue like theft, the pure truth like deception."* This is also like *Confucius* saying: *"I transmit but do not innovate, I trust and love the ancient ways. In this, I modestly compare myself to my old teacher, *Péng* (彭)."* From the *"Lunyu"* (论语) chapter *"Shùér"* (述而), it states: *"The Master said: I transmit but do not innovate, I trust and love the ancient ways. In this, I modestly compare myself to my old teacher, *Péng* (彭)."* The note explains: *"Transmitting (述) means passing on what is old; innovating (作) means creating new beginnings."* Thus, only the Sage can innovate, while the virtuous may transmit. *"Modestly compare"* (窃比) is a respectful phrase, *"I"* (我) is a term of affection. *Péng* (彭) was a great minister of the *Shāng* (商) dynasty, as recorded in *"Dàzǎi Lǐ"* (大载礼). He was one who trusted in antiquity and transmitted its wisdom.

This is also like saying: *"A good merchant conceals his wares as if they were nonexistent, and a man of great virtue appears humble in his bearing."*

From the *"Shǐjì"* (史记) *"Lìe Zhuàn"* (列传): During the reign of *Yōu* (幽) King of *Zhōu* (周), *Confucius* visited the *Zhōu* capital. He served the elderly *Lǎozǐ* (老子) with great reverence and asked him about rites. *Lǎozǐ* (老子) replied: *"The person you speak of, his flesh and bones, have all decayed. Only his words remain in your ears. Moreover, a gentleman rides when the times are favorable, and walks with a staff when they are not. I have heard that a good merchant conceals his wares as if they were nonexistent, and a man of great virtue appears humble in his bearing. Abandon your arrogance and excessive desires, your ostentatious demeanor and licentious thoughts—these are all of no benefit to your person. What I tell you is this: rid yourself of such traits."*

This is also like *Zhuangzi* saying: *"Action only when necessity compels."*

From the *"Zhuangzi"*’s *"Kèyì"* (刻意) chapter: *"Thus, the Sage’s birth is the unfolding of Heaven’s will, and his death is Heaven’s course. At rest, he aligns with the stillness of *yin* (阴) and harmonizes with its virtue; in motion, he surfs the waves of *yáng* (阳) and rides its flow. He does not precede things, nor does he initiate calamity. He responds only when moved, and acts only when necessity compels."* This is also like the *Hànyīn* (汉阴) old man, who *"stood alone, bearing the True as his sole responsibility, and kept apart from the world’s conventions."*

From the *"Zhuangzi"*’s *"Tiāndì"* (天地) chapter: *Zǐgōng* (子贡) traveled south to *Chǔ* (楚), then returned to *Jìn* (晋). Passing through *Hànyīn* (汉阴), he saw an old man diligently preparing a garden plot, dividing fifty *mǔ* (亩) into *qí* (畦). The old man dug a well, entered it with a bucket, and emerged to pour water, his movements clumsy yet laborious. *Zǐgōng* (子贡) said: *"There is a device here—a *gāo* (槔) lever—that can irrigate a hundred plots in a day, requiring far less effort while achieving far more."* The gardener raised his head to look at him and said: *"How so?"* *Zǐgōng* (子贡) explained: *"Carve a wooden lever, with the rear weighted and the front light. Draw water like pulling a string, and release it in measured surges—this is called a *gāo* (槔)."* The gardener flushed with anger and laughed: *"I have heard from my teacher: whoever uses a device will inevitably engage in contrivance, and whoever engages in contrivance will inevitably harbor a contriving heart. A contriving heart, once lodged in the chest, leaves no room for pristine whiteness. When pristine whiteness is incomplete, the spirit’s emergence is unstable. An unstable spirit cannot be borne by the Dao/Way. I am not unaware, but I choose it out of shame."*

*Zǐgōng* (子贡) was abashed and bowed his head, offering no further reply.

This is also like *"Harmonizing with things, blending one’s light."* From the *"Zhuangzi"*’s *"Gēngsāng Chǔ"* (庚桑楚) chapter: *"He moves without knowing where he goes, dwells without knowing what he does—this is how he follows things and rides their flow, the very essence of nurturing life."* This means that things flow as they are, and the Sage blends into their currents, his light harmonized and his traces obscured. In this, the Perfect Man has no heart, merging with the *Xuándào* (玄道, Mysterious Way).

The greatest square has no corners, the greatest vessel takes time to complete, the greatest sound is faint, the greatest form is shapeless. This is also like the *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) and *húliè* (瑚琏).

From the text: The *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) are great tripods. The *"Huángdì Nèi Zhuàn"* (黄帝内传) states: *"The Yellow Emperor explored the copper of *Shǒu* (首) Mountain and cast tripods at *Jīng* (荆) Mountain, which is today’s *Láochéng* (湖城) to the south. These were called the *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) of *Jīng* (荆) Mountain."*

「The *Húliè* (瑚琏) is referenced in *Lǔyǔ* (《鲁语》□公冶长篇). Zǐgòng (子贡) asked: *"How might I compare, Master?"* The Master replied: *"You are a vessel."* He asked: *"What vessel?"* The Master said: *"The *Húliè* (瑚琏)."* The text records: *"The *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) of the *Rǔ* (鲁) were made of millet and wheat; the *Xià* (夏) called them *Hú* (瑚), the *Shāng* (商) called them *Liè* (琏), the *Zhōu* (周) called them *Fǔguì* (簠簋). All were sacred vessels for ancestral temples, valued for their nobility."* Thus it is said: *"The greatest vessel takes time to complete."*

Expounding further: *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) said: *"True beauty lies in enduring duration."* Referencing *Zhuāngzǐ* (《庄子》□人间世篇), *Yègōng Zǐgāo* (叶公子高), about to be dispatched to *Qí* (齐), consulted *Zhòngní* (仲尼). Zhòngní instructed him accordingly. Hence the saying: *"Do not hasten the completion, nor urge it to fruition—excess only harms."* To hasten completion is perilous, yet true beauty lies in enduring duration; what is forced to completion cannot be altered for the worse—should one not fear this?

**Chapter 42: *Dàoshēngyī* (道生一)**
The Dao/Way gives rise to One (一), One gives rise to Two (二), Two gives rise to Three (三), Three gives rise to myriad things (万物).
Expounding further: *"In undifferentiated unity, the One *Qì* (氤氲) does not yet scatter."* This undifferentiated unity is the One (一). The One (一) is the *Tàijí* (太极). Referencing *Lièzǐ* (《列子》□天瑞篇), Zǐ Lièzǐ (子列子) said: *"In ancient times, the Sage followed the interplay of yin and yang to govern the heavens and earth. For what has form arises from what is formless—how then did the heavens and earth come into being?"* Hence it is said: *"There is the *Tàiyì* (太易), the *Tàichū* (太初), the *Tàishǐ* (太始), and the *Tàisù* (太素)."* The *Tàiyì* (太易) is the state before *Qì* (氣) manifests; the *Tàichū* (太初) is the origin of *Qì*; the *Tàishǐ* (太始) is the origin of form; the *Tàisù* (太素) is the origin of substance. When *Qì*, form, and substance are present yet not yet differentiated, it is called *Húnlún* (浑沦). *Húnlún* means that myriad things are undifferentiated yet not yet separated. It is unseen when viewed, unheard when listened to, untraceable when followed—thus it is called *Yì* (易). *Yì* has no fixed form; it transforms into One (一), One into Seven (七), Seven into Nine (九). Nine transformations (九变) signify completion (究). Then it transforms again into One (一). One (一) is the beginning of form’s transformation (形变之始). The light and pure *Qì* ascends to become the heavens, the heavy and turbid descends to become the earth, and the harmonious *Qì* coalesces as humanity. Thus it is said: *"The heavens and earth contain the essence, and myriad things are born through transformation."* Expounding further: *"The heavens and earth in their *Yīnyūn* (氤氲) give rise to myriad things through transformation."*

Referencing *Zhōuyǐ Xìcí* (《周易系辞》): *"The heavens and earth in their *Yīnyūn* (絪缊) embrace, and myriad things are refined through transformation (化醇)."* When male and female intermingle their essences, myriad things are born through transformation (化生). *Yīnyūn* (絪缊) signifies mutual attachment; it speaks of the heavens and earth without intention, naturally attaining unity. Only when the two *Qì* (二气) embrace in *Yīnyūn* (絪缊), harmoniously converging, do myriad things respond and transform into refined essences (精醇). All things bear yin and embrace yang, their harmonious *Qì* (冲气) as their mediator.

Expounding further: *Zhuāngzǐ* (《庄子》□田子方) states: *"The utmost yang blazes with radiance, the utmost yin is solemn and grave. This solemnity emanates from the heavens, this radiance arises from the earth."* The utmost yin is solemn and grave, the utmost yang blazes with radiance; this solemnity emanates from the heavens, this radiance from the earth. This solemnity is yin-*Qì* (阴气), this radiance is yang-*Qì* (阳气)—it speaks of their harmonious balance (交泰). When the two *Qì* (二) intermingle and achieve harmony, then things are born.

Expounding further: *"The Perfect Man empties his spiritual chamber, and pure white *Qì* converges."* Referencing: *"The heart is the abode of the spirit and soul."* Hence it is said: *"The spiritual chamber is an empty space, where pure white *Qì* arises."* Expounding further: *"The virtuous man does not perturb his heart, and thus his *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì* may be nurtured."* Referencing *Mèngzǐ* (《孟子》□公孙丑章句上), *Mèngzǐ* (孟子) said: *"At forty, I do not perturb my heart."* Forty is the age when a strong and capable man’s Dao/Way is clear, his virtue/power established. *Kǒngzǐ* (孔子) also said: *"At forty, one is free from confusion"*—meaning the same as *Mèngzǐ*’s *"not perturbing the heart."*"* *Gǎnwèn* (敢问): *"Master, how do you excel?"* He replied: *"I know speech, and I excel at nurturing my *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì*."* This was *Gōngsūn Qiú* (公孙丑) asking *Mèngzǐ* (孟子) why his *"not perturbing the heart"* differed from *Tàozǐ* (告子). *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì* is what one gains by not perturbing the heart. *Gǎnwèn* (敢问): *"What is this *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì*?"* He replied: *"It is difficult to speak of."* As *Qì*, it is vast and resolute; if one nourishes it uprightly without harm, it fills the space between heaven and earth. What men abhor are solitude, poverty, and lack of grain—yet kings and nobles take these as their titles. Thus, things may sometimes be diminished to gain greater benefit, or increased to greater detriment.

Expounding further: *"Solitude, poverty, and lack of grain"* are omens of misfortune. Referencing *Zuǒzhuàn* (《左传》) and *Chūnqiū* (《春秋》)—already recorded in the earlier chapter on *"Obtaining the One"* (得一), and thus not repeated here.

Expounding further: *"The Dao/Way of heaven diminishes excess and benefits humility."* Referencing *Zhōuyǐ Tiǎn Coǎ Tuǎncí* (《周易谦卦彖辞》): *"The Dao/Way of heaven diminishes excess and benefits humility; the Dao/Way of earth transforms excess into flowing humility; spirits and gods harm excess and favor humility; human nature abhors excess and loves humility. Humility is exalted and luminous, lowly yet uncrossable—this is the end of the virtuous man."*

Expounding further: *"Lowly to preserve oneself."* Referencing the *Yáo cí* (爻辞) of *Zhōuyǐ Tiǎn Coǎ* (《周易谦卦》), *Chūliù* (初六): *"Humility, humility—the virtuous man. Crossing great rivers, auspicious."* The *Xiàng cí* (象辞) says: *"Humility, humility—the virtuous man, lowly to preserve himself."* This means that the humbly virtuous man always nurtures his fortune through humility.

Expounding further: *"The gluttonous and greedy seek wealth and nobility."* Referencing: *"The *Tāotiè* (饕餮) were the unworthy sons of *Zǐyún Shì* (缙云氏)."* The gluttonous (餮) and the greedy (饕) are those who covet wealth and profit to attain riches and nobility—yet do they not know the Sage’s words: *"To be unrighteous yet rich and noble is to me like floating clouds"*?

Expounding further: *"The *Shū* (《书》) says: *"Fullness invites loss."*"* Referencing *Shàngshū* (《尚书》□大禹谟), *Yǔ* (禹) was praised: *"Only through virtue does one move heaven, reaching even the distant—excess invites loss, humility invites benefit. This is the Dao/Way of time."*

「Expounding further: *"The mighty Qin perished through its despotism."* Referencing *Guǎng Sàng Yì* (《广圣义》), it says: *"In ancient times, Qin devoured the seven kingdoms, unified the nine regions, its strength was mighty and its armies invincible. Yet in the end, it crumbled like earth and shattered like pottery, not even lasting a generation. Fú Sū (扶苏) died at the Great Wall, and Yīng (子婴) surrendered at Zhì Dào (轵道), reigning for but forty-six days before Xiàng Yǔ (项羽) arrived to behead him—its lineage extinguished, its state annihilated. From this, is it not clear that despotism brings ruin?"*

Expounding further: *"The Great Han flourished through harmony and benevolence."* Referencing: *"The Han High Ancestor, Liú Bāng (刘邦) of Pēngchéng (彭城) and Fēngpèi (丰沛), promoted the worthy and employed the capable, waged a fierce battle with Xiàng Yǔ (项羽) to seize the realm. His virtue subdued mighty Chu (楚), his benevolence extended to all living beings. Wise strategists plotted for him, and virtuous advisors turned their talents toward him, allowing him to achieve imperial success through the Three Heroes (三杰)—his conquests were sealed by their counsel. With the Three Chapters (三章), he eased the weariness of the people: In the eleventh month of the second year of his reign, the Stripe Prince (沛公) summoned all the elders and leaders of the counties, saying: 'Elders, you have suffered under Qin’s harsh laws for so long. I have made a pact with the feudal lords: whoever enters the Central Plains first shall be king. I shall be king of the Central Plains, and with you, I shall enact only Three Chapters of law. Those who kill shall die, those who wound or steal shall be punished accordingly—all other Qin laws shall be abolished. Let all officials and citizens rest in peace as before.' Thus, the people found security under his rule."*

Expounding further: *"Zǐ Lù (子路) loved valor, Yì (羿) excelled in archery, and Jié (奡) was skilled in rowing—yet none met a good end."* Referencing: *"Zǐ Lù (子路) loved valor, yet did not meet a good end."* This is from *Lúnyǔ* (《论语》□《公冶长第五》). The Master said: *"When the Dao/Way cannot be practiced, one may board a raft and float upon the sea."* Those who follow me, it is Zǐ Lù (子路) and me. Zǐ Lù heard this and rejoiced. The Master said: *"Zǐ Lù (子路), his love of valor surpasses mine, yet he lacks the means to wield it properly."* Zǐ Lù heard this and rejoiced, assuming the Master’s words were a compliment, unaware of their true intent. The Master praised his valor yet criticized his inability to measure actions with righteousness. Yì (羿), the skilled archer, was the ruler of the State of Yǒuqióng (有穷氏), whose strength lay in his archery. Jié (奡), the boat rower, relied on his physical prowess—able to navigate vessels on land, as previously recorded in the thirty-third chapter, and thus not repeated here. These three men all depended on their valor and strength to triumph over others, yet none met a good end—all failed to grasp the virtue of gentleness and yielding. Therefore, the ancient Master warns through this example."*

**Chapter Forty-Three: The Supreme Gentleness of the World**

The supreme gentleness in the world
Overcomes the supreme firmness in the world.

**Annotated Commentary:**
*"The flowing and surging of water."*

**Handwritten Note:**
The flowing and surging of water—from *Lìezǐ*’s *"Huángdì Pān"* (黄帝篇), where Pán Jū notes the distinctions between backwash and forward flow, already recorded in *Dàodé Jīng*, Chapter Four: *"The Way’s Pervasiveness."* No repetition here.

**Without form, it enters the formless.**
**Annotated Commentary:**
*"Piercing metal, penetrating stone."*

**Handwritten Note:**
Quoted from *Lìezǐ*’s *"Zhōu Mùwáng Pān"* (周穆王篇):
In the time of King Mù of Zhōu, a transformed being arrived from the Western Extremity. He entered fire and water, pierced metal and stone, reversed mountains and rivers, shifted cities, rode the void without falling, struck rocks without obstruction—his transformations endless, beyond measure.

**Annotated Commentary:**
*"Circulating through the boundless void, ascending to meet the heavens, descending to coil upon the earth."*

**Handwritten Note:**
Quoted from *Zhuāngzǐ*’s *"Kèyì Pān"* (刻意篇):
*"Spirit pervades the four quarters, flowing without obstruction, reaching the heavens above and coiling upon the earth below."*

Flow—this means *to traverse*.
He who nurtures his spirit thus
Can traverse the four directions,
Flow without hindrance,
Descend to coil upon the earth, thin yet vast,
Ascend to meet the lofty heavens—
In all four directions, above and below, without limit.

**Annotated Commentary:**
*"As in *Lìezǐ*, where Zhào Xiāngzǐ leads ten thousand troops."*

**Handwritten Note:**
From *Lìezǐ*’s *"Huángdì Pān"*—its meaning already detailed above; no repetition.

**Therefore I know the benefits of non-action.**
The teaching of the unsaid,
The benefit of non-action—
Few in the world can attain it.

**Annotated Commentary:**
*"The Sage observes the natural course of the Heavenly Dao."*

**Handwritten Note:**
Quoted from *Huángdì Yīnfǔ Jīng* (黄帝阴符经):
*"The gods and immortals embrace the One, unfolding the Dao"*—
Chapter One, *"Embodying the Dao"*:
*"Observe the Dao of Heaven, follow Heaven’s actions—exhausted."*

**Annotated Commentary:**
*"With composed bearing, one awakens things—thus teaching without words."*

**Handwritten Note:**
From *Zhuāngzǐ*’s *"Tiánzǐ Fāng Pān"* (田子方篇):
Tiánzǐ Fāng attended upon Wéi Wén Hóu, often praising the craftsman of Xī.
The prince asked: *"Is the craftsman of Xī your teacher?"*
Tiánzǐ Fāng replied: *"No, he is a villager of Wúzé."*
*"Yet you praise him so often?"*
*"His words on the Dao are precise, so Wúzé praises him."*
*"Then you have no teacher?"*
*"I do."*
*"Who is your teacher?"*
*"Dōngguō Shùnzǐ."*
*"Then why have you never praised him?"*
*"His nature is true—his face human, his spirit boundless.
He clings to his authenticity, pure yet receptive to things.
When things lack the Dao, he composes his bearing to awaken them."*

「From *Zhuāngzǐ*’s *"Tiánzǐ Fāng Pān"* (田子方篇):

If one’s **Dao/Way** is fully realized—his **qi** harmonized—then Wúzé’s praise is insufficient. Extending the meaning: **Gāoyáo** was mute yet served as the Grand Judge, and under his rule, no cruel punishments existed throughout the land. Thus, there must be value in **speech**—the ability to convey justice.

**Shī Guāng**, blind yet appointed as the Grand Steward, ensured **Jìn**’s governance remained uncorrupted. Thus, there must be value in **vision**—the ability to discern order.

Quoting *Wénzǐ*’s *"Spiritual Essence"* (精神篇), it is said: **"Lǎo Jūn** spoke: ‘The sun’s warmth in winter, the shade in summer—all things return to them without being summoned. They come when not invited, depart when not dismissed, vast and mysterious, their work accomplished without conscious effort. Yet men wait for the sun to illuminate their sight and for words to issue commands. In governance, such reliance is difficult indeed.

**Gāoyáo**, though mute, administered the Grand Judiciary, and no cruel punishments existed under his rule. Thus, there must be value in **speech**—the ability to convey justice.’ From *Huáinán Hóngliè*’s *"Explanations of the Master’s Arts"* (解主术训篇): ‘Though his judgment may seem obscure, the laws and disputes were handled with fairness, so there is value in **speech**—the ability to convey justice.’

**Shī Guāng**, though blind, governed with great order, ensuring **Jìn**’s realm had no chaotic rule. Thus, there must be value in **vision**—the ability to discern what is seen.’ From *Huáinán Hóngliè*’s *"Explanations of the Master’s Arts"* (解主术训篇): ‘Though he was blind, he brought great order, and **Jìn**’s realm was free from corruption—thus, there is value in **vision**—the ability to discern what is seen.’

The **Dao/Way’s** silent command, its unseen insight—this is how the **sage** serves as a teacher. The people are transformed by what they observe, not by his words alone.

Extending the meaning, this passage is cited to prove the **teaching without words**, the **benefits of non-action**—though few can attain such harmony, it is no empty claim.

Extending the meaning: Among the **Nine Schools** and **Hundred Masters**, few can truly grasp the **non-action** of the **Dao/Way**.

Quoting: The **Nine Schools**—as recorded in the *Han Records*—are nine of the ten **schools of thought** worthy of observation.

The nine families are:
1. **Confucianism** (儒家),
2. **Daoism** (道家),
3. **Yin-Yang** (阴阳家),
4. **Legalism** (法家),
5. **Logicians** (名家),
6. **Mohism** (墨家),
7. **Diplomatic Strategists** (纵横家),
8. **Miscellaneous** (杂家),
9. **Agrarianism** (农家).

The **Hundred Masters** of **military schools**—outside the **Six Classics**’s orthodox teachings—each composed their own works. From the **Zhōu** dynasty onward, they established doctrines and recorded texts, numbering over a hundred, all titled **"Zǐ"** (子).

**"Zǐ"** (子) is the general term for **scholar** or **master**. Not daring to equal the **Six Classics**, they were all called **"Zǐ"**, writing **treatises**, **records**, and **books**, sometimes named after their **clans**, sometimes after their **era-specific titles**. Thus we have **Chángzǐ**, **Zēngzǐ**, **Yànzǐ**, **Mèngzǐ**, **Guānzǐ**, **Sūn Qíngzǐ**, **Lǔ Liánzǐ**, **Lièzǐ**, **Zhuāngzǐ**, **Gēngsāngzǐ**, **Wángsūnzǐ**, **Yín Wénzǐ**, **Gōngsūn Nízǐ**, *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* (吕氏春秋), **Dèng Xīzǐ**, **Guǐgǔzǐ**, **Lù Jiā**, **Cháo Cuò**, **Jiǎ Yì**, **Huán Tán**, **Cuī Zǐ**, **Zhōushēng Liè**, **Wèi Lǎng**, **Rén Huì**, **Kāi Xuán**, **Sū Yàn**, **Fú Xuán**, **Táng Bàng**, **Qín Jīng**, **Ruǎn Wǔ**, **Shāng Jūn**, **Lù Yún**, **Biànzǐ**, **Fú Lǎng**, **Sūn Wǔ**, **Shì Shèngzhī**—these are the ones.

Some adopted **alternate titles**, such as:
**Zǐsīzǐ** (子思子), *Tàigōng Jīnkuì* (太公金匮), **Huáinánzǐ** (淮南子), *Yán Tiě Lùn* (盐铁论), *Shuōyuàn* (说苑), *Xīn Xù* (新序), *Lùnhéng* (论衡), *Qiánfú Lùn* (潜夫论), *Fēngsú Tōng* (风俗通), **Wénzǐ** (文子), **Shēn Jiàn** (申鉴), *Chángyán* (昌言), *Diǎnlùn* (典论), *Dǔlùn* (笃论), *Zhōnglùn* (中论), *Wànjī Lùn* (万机论), *Zhōngjīng* (忠经), *Yìlín* (意林), *Dàoyán Lù* (道言录), *Shíjì Jì* (岁时记), *Qíjiù Jì* (耆旧记), *Fǎxùn Wǔjiào* (法训五教), *Shūruò Diǎn yǔ* (刍荛典语), *Mòjì* (默记), *Zhèngshū* (正书), *Zhènglùn* (正论), *Wùlùn* (物论), **Hánzǐ** (韩子), *Rénwù Zhì* (人物志), *Chéngbài Zhì* (成败志), *Tōnglùn* (通论), *Zhèngbù Zhì* (正部志), *Wéitōng Yǔ* (纬通语), *Guóyǔ* (国语), *Yuè Juéshū* (越绝书), *Bàopǔzǐ* (抱朴子), *Shìyào Xīnlùn* (世要新论), *Xīyán Yōuqiú* (析言幽求), *Chánglèzǐ* (长乐子), *Jiāyǔ* (家语), *Tàixuān Jīng* (太玄经), *Fāngyán* (方言), *Fǎyán* (法言), *Zhìlín* (志林), *Sōushén Jì* (搜神记), *Bówù Zhì* (博物志), *Yìxùn* (义训), *Shānhǎi Jīng* (山海经), *Shuǐjīng* (水经), *Dàyuāng Jì* (大荒记), *Shízōu Jì* (十洲记), *Shíyí Lù* (拾遗录), *Běncǎo* (本草), *Xiàngniú Jīng* (相牛经), *Xiàngmǎ Jīng* (相马经), *Xiànghè Jīng* (相鹤经), *Zhōubì* (周髀), *Zhúpǔ* (竹谱), *Sūnzǐ Bīngfǎ* (孙子兵法), *Sīmǎ Bīngfǎ* (司马兵法), *Sūnzǐ Suànjīng* (孙子算经), *Huángshí Gōngjì* (黄石公记), *Xiàngbèi Jīng* (相贝经), and *Wànbì Shù* (万毕术)—these are the ones.

Some delve into **Daoist** profundities, others into **Confucian** rites and scriptures, some adhere to **music, calendrics, and astronomy**, others follow **Yin-Yang** symbols and **divinatory classics**, some constrain themselves by **logical methods**, others by **strategic expedience**. Each exhausts their own strengths, presenting their views in turn. Yet their doctrines vary—now strict, now lenient, now active, now passive—each confined to one corner, few able to **unify and penetrate** all things. To measure them against the **non-action** of the **Dao/Way**, few can attain its heights.

Only the **ruler who embodies the Dao/Way**, the **sovereign of supreme virtue/power**, whose mind harbors no concerns, whose spirit no thoughts—whose movements are formless, whose stillness boundless—who aligns with the **Dao/Way** and is vast in harmony, can follow in the footsteps of **primordial purity** (玄元).

**Chapter Forty-Four: "Names and Reality"**
What is closer: **names** and **reality**?
What is more abundant: **reality** and **wealth**?
What is more harmful: **gain** and **loss**?

Extending the meaning: **Reality** is the host, while **names** are the guest. **Names** are the guest of **reality**. To abandon the host for the guest is called **inversion**.

Quoting *Lièzǐ*’s *"Yáng Zhū"* (杨朱篇): **Yáng Zhū** taught in **Lǔ**, lodging at **Mèng**’s house.
**Mèng**’s family asked: *"Enough with the self—why seek after **names**?"*
He replied: *"**Names** bring **wealth**."*
*"Once wealthy, why persist?"*
*"To attain **nobility**."*
*"Once noble, why continue?"*
*"To secure **death**."*
*"Once dead, why bother?"*
*"For one’s **descendants**."*
*"What benefit do **names** bring to descendants?"*
*"**Names** are the means to burden one’s own **body**, to exhaust one’s **heart**. Those who ride upon **names** shower blessings upon their **clans**, favoring their **kinfolk** and benefiting the entire **neighborhood**. What more for descendants?"*

Extending the meaning: Like **Bào Jiāo** and **Zǐ Tuī**’s kin, they are those who **cling to names** at the expense of **reality**.」

「Excerpt: **Bào Jiāo**—as recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **"Thieves Zhí" chapter**—was a man whose conduct defied the world. He died by embracing a tree. His given name was Jiāo, of the Bào clan, a recluse of the Zhou era. His conduct was pure and unyielding: he carried burdens, gathered firewood, and gathered acorns for sustenance, neither serving the Son of Heaven nor associating with feudal lords. When **Zǐ Gòng** passed by, he said, *"I have heard that one does not tread upon lands whose governance is unjust, nor accept benefits from a disgraced lord. Yet you walk this land and consume its bounty—how can this be just?"* Bào Jiāo replied, *"I have heard that a virtuous man values advancement but despises retreat, that the worthy are easily shamed but lightly die."* Thus, he stood and embraced the tree until he withered away.

**Jiè Zǐ Tuī** was one of unparalleled loyalty. He cut his own thigh to feed **Wén Gōng**, but when Wén Gōng later betrayed him, Jiè Zǐ Tuī, enraged, fled and burned to death while embracing a tree. In his youth, **Jìn Wén Gōng** (Zhòng ěr) faced persecution from his stepmother **Lì Jī**, whose son, **Yí Jiù**, sought to supplant him. Lì Jī slandered Zhòng ěr to **Xiàn Gōng**, who believed her, forcing Zhòng ěr into exile. Starving along the road, Jiè Zǐ Tuī cut his own thigh to feed him. Later, when Zhòng ěr returned to ascend the throne as Wén Gōng, he rewarded his followers—all but Jiè Zǐ Tuī. The latter composed *The Dragon-Snake Song*, inscribed it on the camp gate, and departed in fury. Wén Gōng, repentant, pursued him to **Jiè Shān** (also called **Mián Shān**), but Jiè Zǐ Tuī refused to emerge. The king set the mountain ablaze, hoping to drive him out, but Jiè Zǐ Tuī made no attempt to escape. Instead, he embraced a tree and burned to death.

Thus, these two exemplify those who cling to **names** while burdening **reality**.

**Extended Meaning:** The wealthy toil endlessly to enrich themselves, the noble exhaust themselves in ceaseless scheming. As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **"The Ultimate in Joy" chapter**:
*"What the world reveres are wealth, nobility, longevity, and virtue. What it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine silks, beauty, and music. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and vice. What it suffers are unease of the body, lack of delicacies, absence of fine garments, deprivation of beauty, and silence of music. If these are denied, great anxiety and fear arise. How foolish the body is! The wealthy exhaust themselves in labor, hoarding wealth they cannot fully enjoy—their bodies are thus enslaved by externals. The noble toil night and day, fretting over right and wrong—their bodies are thus estranged. Man is born with care, and the long-lived merely delay death through marriage and wisdom. What suffering is this! Their bodies are thus alienated.

By this reasoning, the wealthy and noble—greedy for **names**, enslaved by **gain**—bear lifelong burdens and know no moment of true joy. This serves as proof for the argument: *Which is greater, the body’s toll or the cost of wealth?*

**Extended Meaning:** The scholar’s sacrifice is for **names**; the greedy man’s for **gain**. As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **"Overlapping Thumbs" chapter**:
*"Let us examine this: since the Three Dynasties, none under heaven have failed to trade their nature for material things. The petty man sacrifices his body for profit, the scholar for **names**, the noble for his clan, and the sage for the world. Thus, though their pursuits differ and their **names** and **reality** diverge, all harm their nature by sacrificing their bodies—one end, the same result."*

**Extended Meaning:** **Bó Yí** died beneath the **Shǒuyáng** slope. (The full account is detailed in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **"Overlapping Thumbs" chapter**, and thus is omitted here.)

**Extended Meaning:** **Zhí Zhí** died for **gain** upon **Dōng Líng**’s heights. (As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **"Overlapping Thumbs" chapter**): Zhí Zhí, a younger kinsman of **Liǔ Xià Huì**, bore the name Zhí, commanding nine thousand soldiers as a notorious bandit. **Dōng Líng** was the name of a mountain—also called **Tài Shān**—located within Jì Zhōu, fifteen *lǐ* from **Dōng Píng**. There, Zhí Zhí met his end.

**Extended Meaning:** **Méng Zhòng** refused the楚相’s offer, preferring instead to be a **yèwěi** (dragging-tail) tortoise. (As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **"Autumn Water" chapter**): **Zhuāngzǐ** fished in the **Pú** River, while **Chǔ Wēi Wáng** sent two officials to invite him, saying, *"We would honor you with our entire realm."* Zhuāngzǐ, holding his fishing rod, paid them no mind, replying, *"I have heard that楚 has a sacred tortoise, dead these three thousand years. The king wraps it in silk and enshrines it in his ancestral temple. Would it not prefer life, dragging its tail in the mud, over death, honored as a relic?"* The two officials answered, *"It would prefer life, dragging its tail in the mud."* Zhuāngzǐ said, *"Then go—I too shall drag my tail in the mud."*

**Extended Meaning:** **Tiān Shī** declined the post of **Dàfū**, instead wishing to study the **Way of Xuān Yuán**. (As recorded in *Zhāng Shì Jiā Zhuán*): **Tiān Shī**, surnamed Zhāng with the given name Dào Líng and courtesy name **Fú Hàn**, was the sixth-generation descendant of **Xiù Hóu**. Naturally reticent and fond of antiquity, he mastered the classics and histories, as well as the studies of stars, constellations, and *tú wéi* (divinatory texts). He relieved the urgent needs of others without regard to kinship, his reputation spreading through court and commoner alike. When **Hàn Cháng Dì** issued an edict summoning him as **Jiànyì Dàfū**, he declined.*

**Translation:**

「Sighing, he said to his disciples: *"Human lifespan lasts but a hundred years—an instant in time! Even parents, wives, and children, though most beloved, cannot be kept forever. And if my own body is not yet perfected, how could I ever possess the noble wealth beyond it? I have heard that in the ancient age, Xuān Yuán and Qiáo Sōng attained the Dao, ascending to the heavens and wandering in the boundless. They are my teachers. I shall abandon the world, sever all ties, and study their Way. I now bid farewell to you all."*

Thereupon, his disciples wept and departed, but only **Wáng Cháng** begged to follow. The **Tiān Shī**, pitying his resolve, and after attending to his own affairs, entered **Qián Héng** and reached **Sōng Yáng**, where he taught the *Huángdì Jiǔ Dǐng Dān Jīng* to the **Shén Rén**. Later, he sought **Xīchéng Shān**, built an altar to worship the **Zhēn**, and refined the **Jiǔ Dān**.

In the ninth month on the ninth day of the **Yǒngshòu** era’s second year, the **Tàishàng** sent a **Yún Yú** (cloud carriage) to welcome him at the **Yúntái Fēng** Peak. In broad daylight, he ascended to the heavens, at the age of **one hundred and twenty-three**.

During the **Tiānbǎo** era’s seventh year, he was posthumously honored as **Tiān Shī**. In the **Mén Hé** era’s fourth year of the **Lí Zōng** reign, he was again honored as the **Sān Qīng Fújiào Dàfǎshī** (Grand Master of the Dao who upholds the Teachings). The **Sòng** court conferred upon him the titles **Sān Tiān Fǔyuán Dàfǎshī** (Grand Master of the Three Heavens who aids the Origin) and **Jìng Yìng Zhēnjūn** (Resplendent and Responsive True Lord).

**Extended Meaning:** As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*: **Yuán Xiàn** dwelled in a **huán dǔ** (circular, thatched) hut in **Lǔ**. It states in the *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **"□ Ràng Wáng" (Possibly "□ Let to King" or "□ Ràng Wáng Píàn" if referring to the *Ràng Wáng* chapter): **Yuán Xiàn**, a disciple of **Kǒngzǐ**, was surnamed **Yuán**, named **Sī**, and had the courtesy name **Xiàn**. **Zǐ Gòng**, another disciple of **Kǒngzǐ**, was named **Zì**, skilled in speech, and fond of luxury and splendor. The text fully preserves his account, without repetition.*

「Extended Meaning states: As recorded in *The Northern History (Běi Shǐ)*: The **Empress Dowager of the Northern Wei (Wèi Míng Tàihòu)** visited the **Glass Cave (Jiǎn Zàng)**.

Transcription from *The Northern History*: The Empress Dowager of the Northern Wei made a state visit to the Glass Cave.

**Five-Peak (Wǔfēng) Recluse Róng Shòuzhèng’s Collection: Chapter 45 – "The Perfect and the Imperfect" (Dàchéng Ruò Quē)**

*"The perfect yet appears incomplete—its use is inexhaustible.
The fullest yet seems empty—its use is unfailing."*

**Extended Meaning states:** The Sage-King **Yáo** achieved great success yet saw himself as lacking, thus becoming the most illustrious of the Five Sovereigns.

Transcription from *The Analects* (Lúnyǔ) – [Possibly "Chapter on Tàibó" (Tàibó Píàn), Eighth]:
The Master said: *"Great indeed was Yáo as a ruler! Lofty and majestic, only Heaven is greater, and Yáo followed it. Broad and boundless, the people could not name its virtue. Lofty and majestic were his achievements. Resplendent were his institutions. Yet he saw himself as lacking, as it is said in the *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **[Possibly "Free and Unfettered Roaming" (Xiāoyáo Yóu Píàn)]**:

Yáo said to **Xǔ Yóu**, offering him the Mandate of Heaven: *"The sun and moon have risen, yet the candle still burns—how difficult it is to match their brilliance! The timely rains have fallen, yet I still must irrigate—how laborious it is to rival their bounty! The Master stands, and the world is governed, yet I remain as a corpse. I see myself as lacking—let me govern the world."*

Xǔ Yóu replied: *"You govern the world, and the world is already governed. What more is there to say?"*

**Extended Meaning states:** Confucius gathered the teachings into perfection yet did not claim sainthood, thus becoming the teacher for all ages.

Transcription from *Mencius* (Mèngzǐ) – **[Possibly "Chapter on Wàn Zhāng" (Wàn Zhāng Zhāngjù Shàng)]**:
Mencius said: *"Confucius is what we call the ‘Gatherer of Perfection.’*
*‘Gathering perfection’ means harmonizing the golden tones with the jade resonances. The golden tones are the beginning of order, and the jade resonances are its completion. The beginning of order refers to the threads of wisdom, like the strands of music. This is the work of intelligence. The completion of order is the work of sainthood. That Confucius did not claim sainthood is as stated in **[Possibly "Chapter on Gōngsūn Chǒu" (Gōngsūn Chǒu Zhāngjù Shàng)]**:

Gōngsūn Chǒu asked: *"Then the Master was indeed a sage?"*
The Master replied: *"How can you say such a thing?*
*Once, Zǐ Gòng asked me: ‘Are you a sage?’*
*I said: ‘Sainthood is beyond me. I only learn without satiety and teach without weariness.’*
*Zǐ Gòng said: ‘To learn without satiety is wisdom. To teach without weariness is benevolence. With both wisdom and benevolence, are you not a sage?’*
*Yet the Master did not claim sainthood—how can you say so?"*

*"The most straight appears bent,
The most skillful seems clumsy,
The most eloquent seems tongue-tied."*

**Extended Meaning states:** **Liǔ Xià Huì** served others with uprightness, yet was dismissed three times without leaving.

Transcription from *The Analects* – **[Possibly "Chapter on Wēizǐ" (Wēizǐ Píàn), Eighteenth]:**
Liǔ Xià Huì was a virtuous high official of **Lǔ**, named **Zhǎn Qín**. As **Shìshī** (a judicial officer), he was exiled—*Shìshī* being a position overseeing legal matters. *"Out"* here means *"banished."*

「Once banished twice, someone said to him: *"You cannot yet leave."* He replied: *"If one serves others with uprightness, where would one not be banished three times? If one serves others with crookedness, why must one leave one’s parents’ domain?"*

**Extended Meaning states:** *Carving and shaping myriad forms, yet not claiming skill.*
Transcription: *The greatest skill, as Zhuangzi said, is to "cover and load the heavens and earth, carve and shape myriad forms, yet not claim skill." Would one who makes mulberry-leaf paper claim skill?*
**Extended Meaning states:** *As in Ziqing’s carving of wood into a vessel.*
*Ziqing was the Grand Carpenter of Lu. Ziqing was his name, and "Ziqing" was his official title.*
Transcription: *The text from the "Dàshēng" (On Nurturing Life) chapter of Zhuangzi is fully detailed above.*

**Extended Meaning states:** *Not adorning with frivolous tales.*
Transcription: *The "xiaoshuo" (novelistic) tradition emerged from the "baiguan" (popular records), the gossip of streets and alleys, and hearsay from the roads. These texts comprised fifteen families and one hundred thirteen chapters.*

**Extended Meaning states:** *Thus, the Master said, "I wish to speak not at all."*
Transcription: *What speech does Heaven make? The four seasons proceed, and all things flourish. What speech does Heaven make?*
From the *Yánghuò* (Yang Huo) chapter of *The Analects*:
The Master said: *"I wish to speak not at all."*
Zigong said: *"If you do not speak, how shall we, your disciples, have anything to transmit?"*
The Master said: *"What speech does Heaven make? The four seasons proceed, and all things flourish. What speech does Heaven make?"*
Agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat—*tranquility and purity are the natural order of the world.*

**Extended Meaning states:** *Wearing coarse linen in summer.*
Transcription: *In the "Xiāngdàng" (Conduct) chapter of The Analects:*
When the heat was intense, he wore a single layer of coarse linen, *zì* (fine hemp cloth) and *xì* (coarse hemp cloth). The finest hemp cloth was called *zì*, the coarser *xì*. He would first put on his inner garment, then the outer layer of *zì* and *xì*.

From *Chapter on "Tianxia You Dao"* (The World in Harmony), Forty-Sixth:
*No guilt is greater than covetousness,
No calamity is greater than insatiability,
No blame is greater than the desire to seize.*

**Extended Meaning states:** *The calamity of greed and recklessness.*

From the *Lower Appendices* of the *Yì* (Book of Changes):
*"Goodness not accumulated is insufficient to establish a name,
Evil not accumulated is insufficient to destroy one’s life.
The petty man considers minor goodness as useless and does not practice it,
And considers minor evil as harmless and does not abandon it.
Thus, evil accumulates and becomes irrepressible,
Guilt grows great and becomes unforgivable.*
The *Yì* says: *Greed and recklessness bring ruin.*

**Extended Meaning states:** *Like the case of the Qí man who snatched gold—
He who sees gold but not the man is truly afflicted.*
From the *Lìezǐ* (Liezi)—*Chapter on "Sayings of the Spirit"*:
Once, a man from Qí coveted gold.
At dawn, he dressed formally and went to the market,
Where he encountered a seller of gold,
And seized the gold before fleeing.
An official caught him and asked: *"Everyone was present—
Why did you snatch another’s gold?"*
He replied: *"When I took the gold,
I saw only the gold, not the man—
Only the gold, not the man."*
This illustrates how intense desire can cloud the mind.
Thus the ancients said:
*"He who scrutinizes the tip of an autumn hair
Does not perceive the shape of Tàishān.
He who fine-tunes the harmony of the five tones
Does not hear the thunderous roar of the heavens.*
Indeed, when the mind is fixed on what it craves,
The body forgets all else—
How can one not be cautious?"*

**Extended Meaning states:** *From the "Rú Huángōng Shìyīn" (Spring and Autumn Annals—Duchy of Lu, Year Ten) chapter of the *Chūnqiū*.*
From the *Chūnqiū*—*its meaning has already been detailed in the text, so it is not repeated here.*

**Extended Meaning states:** *Like Zhōumò’s Zhīxiāngzǐ seeking land from Hán Kāngzǐ.*
From the *Chūnqiū*—*its meaning is already fully recorded in the text, so it is not written again.*
Thus, the sufficiency of *knowing contentment* is everlasting.

**Extended Meaning states:** *Once, Hàn Yán Jūn Píng was friendly with Luó Chōng, a wealthy man from Shù Jùn.*
From the text—*its meaning is already fully recorded, so it is not repeated here.*

**Chapter on "Not Leaving the Door"** (Forty-Seventh):
*"No guilt is greater than covetousness,
No calamity is greater than insatiability,
No blame is greater than the desire to seize."*

**Chapter on "Not Leaving the Door" (Forty-Seventh):**
*"To not leave the door, yet know the world.
To not peer through the window, yet see the Dao of Heaven.*
**Extended Meaning states:** *All things are complete within me; reflect inwardly to find them.*
From the text—*its meaning is already fully recorded, so it is not repeated here.*

**Extended Meaning states:** *The Master Mencius said: All things are complete within me.*
*This speaks of the inherent nature of principles.*
From great to small—rulers and subjects, fathers and sons—
to trivial matters of daily life,
the natural order of things is none other than
what is already contained within the inherent nature of each.
To reflect inwardly and act sincerely—
no greater joy exists.*

**Huì’ān’s Annotation:** *This chapter discusses how the principles of all things*
*are fully embodied in one’s own person—*
*thus, the Dao resides within me,*
*and joy is abundant.*
If practiced with *rú* (benevolence/forbearance),
then selfishness has no place,
and *rén* (humanity) can be attained.

**Extended Meaning states:** *Yángzǐ said: Is not the human heart divine?*
From the text—*its meaning is already fully recorded in the *Yángzǐ Fǎyán* [□ *Wènshén* ("Discussing the Divine")] chapter.*
*Divinity lies in its hidden potential.*
To cultivate the heart is to manifest Heaven’s divine illumination—
the interplay of yin and yang, the divine essence of Heaven.
The movement of the sun and moon—Heaven’s clarity.
Illuminating all four directions—
Heaven’s divine and luminous radiance
can clarify the murky and penetrate the dark,
shedding light upon all.
The essence and purity of Heaven—
the *Qián* (Heaven) embodies vigor and rectitude,
its utmost refinement.
All things follow their kind,
nurturing and covering them,
each fulfilling its own nature.
Is not the human heart divine?
In Heaven and Earth, it is divine;
in humans, it is the heart.
The heart is the conduit to divinity.
Hold it, and it remains;
abandon it, and it perishes.
Only the Sage can constantly hold and preserve it.*

**Extended Meaning states:** *The timing of rain, wind, and sun aligns with virtue.*
From the text—*its meaning is already fully recorded in the *Shàngshū* [□ *Hóngfàn* ("The Grand Tract")] chapter.*
*It says: "When virtue is at rest, the rain is timely;
when virtue is grave, the wind is timely;
when virtue is sagacious, the heat is timely;
when virtue is prudent, the cold is timely;
when virtue is holy, the breezes are timely."*
This refers to reckless arrogance, usurpation, complacency, haste, and ignorance.
In Heaven, it manifests as the Five Phases (*wǔxíng*);
in humans, as the Five Affairs (*wǔshì*).
When the Five Affairs are cultivated, the auspicious signs appear,
each corresponding to its kind.
When the Five Affairs are neglected, calamitous signs arise,
each corresponding to its kind.
This is the natural order of things.

**Extended Meaning states:** *The stars and constellations shift their degrees.*
From the text—*its meaning is already fully recorded in the *Guǎngshèngyì* ("Comprehensive Sage Teachings").*
*It says: "This is the principle of the Emperor.
He follows Heaven’s cover, follows Earth’s bearing,
observes the symbols of the sun and moon,
and reverently instructs the people in the proper times.
With the *xuánpú* (suspended pivot) and *yùhéng* (jade axis),
he harmonizes the Seven Luminaries (*qīzhèng*),
thus aligning with Heaven’s Dao.
When the stars and constellations shift their degrees,
and the sun and moon lose their proper times,
one must rectify conduct, offer incense,
and recite the scriptures."*
From the *Língbǎo Dùrén Jīng* ("Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure for Saving People"):
*The stars and constellations shift their degrees,*
*the sun and moon lose their proper times,*
*and one must rectify conduct, offer incense,*
*and recite the scriptures.*

**Extended Meaning states:** *The Sage aligns in virtue with Heaven and Earth,*
*in luminosity with the sun and moon,*
*acting before Heaven and Heaven does not oppose,*
*acting after Heaven and following Heaven’s timing.*
From the *Zhōuyǐ* (I Ching)—*the "Nine-Five" commentary of the *Qián* (Heaven) Hexagram:*
*"The Great Person aligns in virtue with Heaven and Earth,
in luminosity with the sun and moon,
in sequence with the Four Seasons,
in fortune with the spirits and gods.
Acting before Heaven, Heaven does not oppose;
acting after Heaven, one follows Heaven’s timing.
*This means: when one acts before Heaven’s timing,*
*Heaven’s Dao responds in harmony and does not resist.*
*When one acts after Heaven’s timing,*
*one submits in reverence to Heaven’s Dao and dares not defy it.*
Thus, if a ruler can be so,
he need not peer through windows or gaze afar—
Heaven’s Dao becomes clear of itself.
Therefore, the Sage acts without exertion yet knows,
sees without looking yet understands,
accomplishes without doing yet succeeds.

**Extended Meaning states:** *Yáo’s virtue was as vast as Heaven,*
*his wisdom as divine as the gods.*
*Shùn’s understanding was clear in human relationships,*
*his insight profound in all things.*
*This can be called knowing the world.*
*Only Heaven is great; only Yáo followed it.*
*When violent winds and thunderous rains came,*
*Shùn did not falter.*
*This can be called seeing Heaven’s Dao.*
*What then did he do?*
*Only to be reverent and upright,*
*and to govern from the southern face.*
From the *Shǐjì*—*the "Běnjì" (Basic Records) chapter:*
*Yáo, by the posthumous name law, is called:*
*"Yáo—his virtue spread goodness and transmitted the sacred;*
*his virtue was as vast as Heaven,*
*his wisdom as divine as the gods.*
*Approaching him was like the warmth of the sun,*
*gazing upon him like the light of clouds.*
*Though wealthy, he was not proud,*
*though noble, he did not relax.*
*He ruled for seventy years,*
*and found Shùn.*
*After twenty years,*
*he grew old,*
*and commanded Shùn to assume the role of Son of Heaven,*
*recommending his governance to Heaven.*
*Yáo withdrew from the throne,*
*and after twenty-eight years,*
*he passed away.*
*After the three-year mourning,*
*Shùn ascended to the throne of Son of Heaven.*
*It also cites Shùn’s clarity in human relationships,*
*his insight in all things—*
*this is from the *Mèngzǐ*—*the "Líliú" (Leaving and Staying) chapter, upper section.*
*Shùn’s understanding was clear in all things,*
*his insight profound in human relationships.*
*He acted through virtue and righteousness,*
*not by forcing virtue and righteousness upon others.*
*Only Heaven is great—*
*this is from the *Lǔlùn* (Lu’s Discourses)—*the "Tàibó" (Tai Bo) chapter.*
*The Master said:*
*'Great indeed was Yáo as a ruler!*
*Majestic and awe-inspiring!*
*Only Heaven is great,*
*and only Yáo followed it.*
*Gentle and broad in his governance,*
*the people could not name his virtues.*
*Majestic and awe-inspiring!*
*His achievements were grand.*
*His conduct was refined.*
*When violent winds and thunderous rains came,*
*Shùn did not falter—*
*this is from the *Shùn Diǎn* (Shun’s Approbation).*
*It says:*
*'When reflecting upon antiquity,*
*the Emperor Shùn, also called Zhònghuá,*
*was in harmony with the Emperor.*
*He was profound in wisdom and clear in virtue,*
*warm in reverence and broad in benevolence,*
*his sincerity and trust were complete.*
*His mysterious virtue ascended and was heard by Heaven,*
*and thus he was entrusted with the throne.*
*He reverently observed the Five Precepts,*
*and the Five Precepts were fulfilled.*
*He received the hundred measures of governance,*
*and the hundred measures were in harmony.*
*He welcomed guests at the Four Gates,*
*and the Four Gates were orderly.*
*He ascended the great mound,*
*and even violent winds and thunderous rains did not confuse him.*
*Yáo commanded Shùn to enter the mountains, forests, rivers, and marshes,*
*where violent winds and thunderous rains arose,*
*yet Shùn walked without faltering.*
*What then did he do?*
*Only to be reverent and upright,*
*and to govern from the southern face.*
*This is from the *Lúnyǔ*—*the "Wèilínggōng" (Wei Ling Gong) chapter, fifteenth section.*
*The Master said:*
*'The one who governs without action is Shùn.*
*And what did he do?*
*Only to be reverent and upright,*
*and to govern from the southern face.*
*When eating, he thought of the hungry in the world;*
*when clothing himself, he thought of the cold in the world."*

This is from the *Mencius*—the *"Líliú Zhāngjū Shàng"* (上), where Mencius says:

*"Yǔ, Jì, and Yán Huí shared the same Dao.
Yǔ thought: 'If there are those drowning in the world, it is as if I myself were drowning.'
Jì thought: 'If there are those starving in the world, it is as if I myself were starving.'
Thus was their urgency so great.
They loved their parents and extended that love to the aged of the world,
and loved their children and extended that love to the young of the world."*

This is from the *Mencius*—the *"Liáng Huìwáng Zhāngjū Shàng"* (上), where Mencius, in reply to King Huì of Liang, said:

*"Revere my elders, and extend that reverence to the elders of others;
love my young, and extend that love to the young of others.
Thus, the world may be governed as if in the palm of one’s hand.
This is the Dao of observing oneself to understand one’s family,
and observing one’s family to understand the world,
until one observes the world to understand the world.
If such is the case, then why must one step outside the door
before knowing the world?"*

This speaks of the sage-rulers Yáo and Shùn,
who followed the effortless, natural Dao of Heaven and Earth,
transforming the world as grass bends with the wind—
lying down naturally and being transformed thereby.

Thus it is said:
*"Therefore, the sage acts without action, knows without seeing,
discerns without looking, achieves without doing—
this is how."*

The extended meaning states:
*"The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records the Duke Zhuāng of Zhèng’s attack on his younger brother, the Great Minister Duàn.
Quoted from the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.
Its meaning has already been detailed—no need for repetition."*

For Learning, Daily Gain—Chapter Forty-Eight
To learn is to daily gain; to follow the Dao is to daily lose.

Extended meaning states:
Of the kind where one hangs one’s head, pricks one’s thigh, studies by candlelight, or gathers fireflies.
Quoted:
The one who hangs his head: *The Chronicles of the Worthy Sage of Chu* says,
Na Sun Jing, styled Wén Bǎo,
always shut his door and read. When he slept, he tied a string to his head
and hung it from the rafters. Later, he became a great scholar.
The Emperor summoned him, but he did not respond.

The one who pricks his thigh: *The Records of the Grand Historian* says,
Sū Qín was a man of Luòyáng in the Eastern Zhōu.
He studied under Master Guǐgu, wandering for several years,
then returned in great distress. His brothers, sisters-in-law,
wives, and concubines all mocked him.
Qín heard this and felt ashamed, so he closed himself in his room.
He obtained *The Stratagems of Tàigōng*, lay down and read it,
and when he wanted to sleep, he pulled a thorn to prick his thigh,
so that blood flowed down to his heel. Later, he counselled Zhào,
and Zhào heeded him. Thus, he wore the seals of the Six Kingdoms’ ministers,
and roamed the world with his schemes.

The one who studies by candlelight: In the past, Sun Kāng,
being poor, struggled to learn without money to buy oil.
He often studied by the light of snow. Later, he became Grand Scribe.

The one who gathers fireflies: Sòng Chē Yìn, styled Wǔzǐ,
also suffered poverty and devoted himself to learning.
At night, he used a crimson silk bag to gather dozens of fireflies,
and read by their light. His relentless pursuit of learning
thus led him to become a great scholar as well.

Now, those who seek learning,
all begin by daily studying to grasp the Dao,
cultivating skill to mend their faults,
and end by awakening to truth and forgetting words,
discarding skill and letting go of attachment—
using perception and hearing as the gradual stages of cultivation,
and diminishing skillful actions as the gateway to enlightenment in the Dao.
These few men here,
have lifelong worries but no single day’s joy,
laboring their minds and exhausting their spirits,
drowning themselves in vast learning—
then they must inevitably reach their end.

Extended meaning states:
Only by humbling one’s ambition and striving for timely diligence
does true cultivation arise.
Quoted from *The Book of Documents* [□] *Saying of Mìng* [below]:
*"Only by humbling one’s ambition and striving for timely diligence
does true cultivation arise.
With sincere devotion to this, the Dao accumulates within oneself."*

This means:
To humble one’s ambition is as if unable to do so,
To diligently study is as if unable to keep up—
Receiving others with emptiness,
Exerting oneself with earnestness—
Then one’s cultivation will flow like a spring,
uninterrupted and abundant in its coming.

Extended meaning states:
To drown oneself in vast learning,
To use culture to extinguish one’s innate nature.
Quoted from *Zhuāngzǐ* [□] *The Chapter on Refining One’s Nature*:
*"Knowledge without depth,
Seeking to establish the world,
Then adorn it with culture,
And enrich it with vast learning.
Culture extinguishes the innate nature,
Vast learning drowns the mind.
One does not know that the innate nature is the foundation of culture.
Culture’s brilliance hides within simplicity,
The innate nature’s depth endures in the mind.
Vast learning obscures the mind’s essence—
Only by abandoning learning and letting go of culture
Can one attain the beauty of effortless action."*

Extended meaning states:
Thus, the *Yì* [□] *Benefit* [hexagram] is great.
The *Xìang* [□] says: *"Wind and thunder, Benefit.*
The gentleman, seeing good, moves toward it,
Having faults, corrects them."

Quoted:
The words of the *Benefit* [hexagram] say,
*"Wind must precede thunder,
Thunder must follow wind,
Then all things will be benefited.*
Thus it is said: *Wind and thunder, Benefit.*
To move means to migrate and emulate,
To correct means to amend and restrain.
Moving toward good and correcting faults—
No greater benefit exists."*

Extended meaning states:
The greatness of *Diminishing* [□].
The *Xìang* [□] says: *"Mountain and marsh, Diminishing.*
The gentleman uses this to restrain anger and suppress desire."

Quoted:
The words of the *Diminishing* [hexagram] say,
*"Mountain beneath, marsh above—Diminishing.*
The gentleman uses this to restrain anger and suppress desire."

Annotation:
*"The desires of man are stirred by things,
And the world’s circumstances bring joy or sorrow—
Thus, emotions have anger and craving.
To restrain means to still what has already arisen,
To suppress means to block what is yet to come.
Anger and desire both have past and future—
Restraining and suppressing are profound principles that complement each other."*

Taking the world requires the Way of non-action.
When one has affairs, it is not enough to take the world.

Extended meaning states:
Qín conquered the Six Kingdoms.
Quoted:
Qín Shǐhuáng’s name was Zhèng,
The son of Zhuāngxiāng Wáng.
In the twenty-sixth year of his reign,
He extinguished the Six Kingdoms,
Conquered the world,
And proclaimed himself the First Emperor.
The Six Kingdoms—Yān, Qí, Chǔ, Wèi, Hàn, and Zhào—
Were all annihilated in his time.
The *Records of the Grand Historian* says:
*"Qín Shǐhuáng rose to greatness,
And with one stroke of his policy, vanished without a trace."*

Extended meaning states:
He abolished the *well-field system*,
Opened the *intermediate fields*,
Removed the *straight roads*,
Built the *A Fáng*,
Constructed the *Great Wall*,
And developed the *Five Ridges*.

Quoted:
The *well-field system*: According to *The Records of the Grand Historian* and the *Gǔliáng Transmission*,
In ancient times, three hundred paces made a *lǐ*,
Called *well-field*. The *well-field system*
Allocated nine hundred *mǔ* of land, with one hundredth as public fields.
Abolishing the *well-field system* and opening the *intermediate fields*—
In the nineteenth year, when Qín Xiàogōng appointed Shāng Yáng,
The *well-field* was replaced by *intermediate fields*,
And from then, the troubles of兼并 (*combination/annexation*) began.
This is the same as the Qín laws.
In the twelfth year, he opened the *intermediate fields* for farming.
In the fourteenth year, he abolished the *well-field system*,
Opened the *intermediate fields*,
And collected taxes.

Removing the *straight roads*—
In the thirty-fifth year of Qín Shǐhuáng’s reign,
He ordered Mèng Tiān to remove the *straight roads*,
From Jiǔyuán to Yún Yáng,
Carving through mountains and filling valleys for a thousand eight hundred *lǐ*.
It took several years but was not completed.
Qín Shǐhuáng thought the people of Xiànyáng were too numerous,
And the palaces of former kings too small,
So he began constructing the imperial palace in Wèinán’s *Shànglín Garden*.
First, he built the *forecourt*, named it *Āfáng*—
Annotation: *"The four eaves of the hall were all made into chambers."*
Five hundred paces east to west,
Fifty *zhàng* north to south,
Its height could seat ten thousand men,
Its depth could raise a five-*zhàng* banner.
From its base straight to the southern mountains,
He marked the peak of the southern mountains as the *gateway*,
But the work was unfinished when it was burned by Xiàng Yǔ.

Constructing the *Great Wall*—
In the thirty-second year,
Qín Shǐhuáng inspected the northern border,
Where Lúshēng advised him to enter the sea and return,
And thus he ordered the recording of books, saying:
*"The one who destroys Qín will be the Hu."*

Qín Shǐhuáng then dispatched General **Mèng Tián** to lead **three hundred thousand men** in a northern expedition against the **Xióngnú**,
Seizing the lands south of the **Hé River** and establishing **forty-four prefectures**,
Constructing the **Great Wall** and utilizing the terrain to create formidable passes—
From **Lín Táozhōu** to **Liáodōng**, stretching over **ten thousand li**,
Its might shook the **Xióngnú**.

The **Five Ranges** are:
The **Dàyǔ Range**, the **Shǐ’ān Range**, the **Lín Hé Range**, the **Guìyáng Range**, and the **Jiēyáng Range**.

In the **thirty-third year**,
He made a preliminary conquest of the **Nán Yuè** lands,
Establishing the **commanderies of Guìlín**, **Nánhǎi**, and **Xiàng**,
And thus banished and relocated **five hundred thousand people** to garrison the **Five Ranges**.

**Extended annotation** states:
*"The **Xiàng** clan broke through the **Hángǔ Pass**, burned the Qín palaces, seized treasures, slew **Zǐ Yīng**, and deposed the **Yì Emperor**."*
**Excerpt:** *"The **Xiàng** clan refers to **Chǔ Xiàng Jié**, courtesy name **Yǔ**, a native of **Bǐn County**."*

In the **third year of Qín Èrshì’s reign**,
As the **ruler of all under Heaven**,
He declared himself **West Chǔ’s Conqueror-King** and made **Péngchéng** his capital.

That year,
He broke through the **Hángǔ Pass**,
Massacred **Xiàngyáng**,
Slew **Zǐ Yīng**,
And burned the Qín palaces—
The flames raged for **three months** before extinguishing.
He took their treasures, womenfolk, and departed eastward.
The Qín people were utterly disheartened.

**Translation:**

For eight years, **Yǔ** raised his forces and contended with **Pèi Gōng** for all under Heaven, ultimately defeated at **Gāixià**, and surrendered by presenting his head.

He ruled as **Conqueror-King** over all under Heaven, his reign established in **Hàn**. In the second year of **Èrshì’s reign**, the tenth month, **Xiàng Wáng** secretly dispatched **Jiǔjiāng Wáng Bù** and **Yīng Bù** to strike down **Yì Dì**, killing him in the river.

When **Hàn Wáng** arrived at **Luòyáng’s New City**, **Sān Lǎo Dǒng Gōng** intercepted and addressed the king, saying:
*"I have heard: Those who align with virtue prosper; those who defy it perish. When armies march, none stand to their right. Thus, undertakings fail. Therefore, it is said: Make clear who the bandit is, and the enemy may be subdued. **Xiàng Yǔ** acts without the **Dao**; thus, he slays his sovereign—he is the bandit of all under Heaven."*

**Moral Teachings from the *Dàodé Jīng* – Extended Commentary, Volume 13 Complete**
**Moral Teachings from the *Dàodé Jīng* – Handwritten Notes, Volume 14**

**From *Five-Peak Hermit Róng Shǒuzhèng’s Collection* – Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Fixed Mind**
The Sage has no fixed mind; he takes the minds of the people as his own.

**Extended Commentary:** *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *"The Perfect Man’s use of mind is like a mirror—neither grasping nor repelling."*

**Handwritten Notes** (*Zhuāngzǐ – "Yìng Dì Wáng" Section*): *"Do not be a hollow name, do not be a scheming treasury, do not be a burden of affairs, do not be a master of knowledge. Exhausting the boundless, yet wandering without trace, exhausting what Heaven has bestowed, yet seeing no gain—this is emptiness indeed. The Perfect Man’s use of mind is like a mirror: neither grasping nor repelling, responding yet not hoarding. Thus, he overcomes all things without harm."*

**Extended Commentary:** In ancient times, **Qín Mù Gōng** once lost his thousand-*lǐ* steed.

**Handwritten Notes:** This is the text from *The Spring and Autumn Annals*; it is already recorded in the *Extended Commentary* and need not be repeated.

*"I believe those who trust me, and I also believe those who do not."*

**Extended Commentary:** In ancient times, a man presented a live fish to **Zǐ Chǎn**.

**Handwritten Notes** (*Mèngzǐ – "Wàn Zhāng Shàng" Section*): The text is already detailed in the *Extended Commentary* and need not be repeated again.

「Yet further, he spoke of the tranquil and contented manner of aligning with one’s **Dao/Way** and **qi/vital energy**, this being the text from *The Analects – "Xiāng Páng"* Section. Its general meaning is that the tranquil and sincere demeanor of one who embodies **virtue/power** appears as though he cannot speak, yet it is the humble and yielding posture of one who does not presume his wisdom over others.

**Chapter Fifty: "Life and Death"**
Life and death, entering and exiting.

**Extended Commentary:** Observing the origin and returning to the end, one thus understands the doctrine of life and death. The handwritten notes from *The Zhouyi* (I Ching) state: "Hence, he knows the **Dao/Way** of encompassing all things." Gazing upward to study the celestial patterns, looking downward to examine the earthly structures, thus one knows the reasons behind the hidden and the manifest. Observing the origin and returning to the end, one thus understands the doctrine of life and death. This speaks of using the **Dao/Way** of *The Zhouyi* in upward contemplation and downward observation, thereby knowing the unseen yet profound (幽) and the seen yet apparent (明), the principles and their applications.

Observing the origin and returning to the end, one thus understands the doctrine of life and death. It means that by applying the principles of *The Zhouyi* to trace the initial stages and the final outcomes of all things, one comprehends the auspicious and inauspicious fate of their beginnings and endings, thereby knowing the doctrine of life and death.

Of those who live, ten in every thirteen are reckless; of those who die, ten in every thirteen are reckless. In the course of human life, ten in every thirteen meet their death through reckless actions.

**Extended Commentary:** This refers to the use of the nine orifices and four limbs, or the three activities and ten evils.
The handwritten notes from **Hán Fēi** state: "Ten in every thirteen refers to the nine orifices and four limbs." That is, the two ears, two eyes, two nostrils (considered as two orifices), along with the mouth and the two lower orifices, totaling nine orifices. The two hands and two feet are termed the four limbs. **Hé Shàng Gōng** also agrees with this interpretation.

Another interpretation cites the three activities and ten evils. The three activities refer to **body, speech, and mind**. The ten evils are:
1. Killing living beings,
2. Theft and robbery,
3. Lewdness and licentiousness,
4. Treason and rebellion against superiors,
5. Defaming and slandering sacred scriptures and laws,
6. Cursing and blaspheming in darkness,
7. Secret plotting, resentment, and jealousy,
8. Slanderous speech and causing discord,
9. Breaking vows and violating precepts,
10. Touching or defiling altars and sacred grounds.

**Sūn Dēng’s** explanation states: Among the things of Heaven and Earth, those of the living kind, few abide by the **Dao/Way**, while many defy it. Hence, of those who live recklessly, three in every ten conform to the **Dao/Way**. Those who live not in accordance with the **Dao/Way** and die not in accordance with reason are few, while those who defy them are many. Thus, of those who die, three in every ten submit to their fate.

The *Broad Explication of the Sacred* states: One who does not take joy in life yet remains content with it is among those who live recklessly. If one does not let desires and greed disrupt his mind while alive, nor let excessive nourishment harm his nature, but remains at ease with simplicity and humility, aligns with the natural flow of **qi/vital energy**, maintains the tranquility of his spirit, and steadies his mind—then, without seeking to prolong life, life itself will be extended. Without striving to advance in the **Dao/Way**, the **Dao/Way** will progress naturally. This is the teaching of **Dù Tiānshī**.

In my humble view, those who preserve life in such a manner are not merely three in every ten. Even among a thousand or ten thousand, there may be none or only one or two. Thus, by this reasoning, are they not few indeed?

The *Yanyì* states: **"To dwell in harmony with the times and align with the natural order."** It cites the text from the *Zhuangzi*’s **"Great Master"** chapter:

*"To gain is to follow the times; to lose is to conform. He who dwells in harmony with the times and aligns with the natural order is impervious to sorrow and joy. This is what the ancients called **‘suspended detachment’**—detachment without bonds or attachments. Why so? Because his vital essence is profound and unexhausted."*

The *Yanyì* elaborates: *"Excessive pursuit of life-nourishing substances, when taken to excess, leads to death."* It cites the *Zhuangzi*’s **"Mastering Life"** chapter:

*"The first requirement for nurturing the form is moderation. There are cases where nourishment abounds, yet the body remains unnourished. Truly, those skilled in preserving life traverse land without fear of rhinoceros or tiger, enter battlefields unarmored by weapons. The rhinoceros finds no place to strike with its horn, the tiger no place to extend its claws, and weapons no opening to pierce—why? Because they dwell in **‘non-death’**."*

The *Yanyì* further explains: *"Zhuangzi said: ‘If one empties oneself to wander through the world, who could harm them?’"* It cites the *Zhuangzi*’s **"Mountain Trees"** chapter:

*"Two square boats drifted side by side upon the river. A hollow vessel came to collide with them—though the passage was narrow and constricted, no anger arose, for the vessel was empty. A man of such a mind, if another stood upon him, would call out, ‘Expand and contract!’ If the first call went unheard, the second unheard, then a third—he would not respond with harshness. Earlier, he was not angry yet now he is; earlier, he was empty yet now he is full. If one empties themselves to wander through the world, who could harm them?"*

The *Yanyì* concludes: *"As in the Daoist transmission of Liu Gang."* It notes: *"This is recorded in the *List of Immortals*, with its meaning already fully elaborated. This is Chapter Fifty-One of *Dao Sheng*."*

The Dao/Way gives birth to it, virtue/power nurtures it, things shape it, and circumstances complete it.

*Yanyì* notes: *"Thus, the naked cannot but be naked, and those with scales, shells, fur, or feathers cannot but have scales, shells, fur, or feathers."*

Recorded in *The Analects of Confucius*, Chapter Twenty-Four of *The Five Emperors*: These are the words of Confucius in response to Zigong.

Confucius said: *"Indeed, I once heard from Laozi that it was as you say. Thus, those born of firm earth are sturdy, those of weak earth are yielding, those of crumbling earth are vast, those of sandy earth are refined, those of damp earth are beautiful, and those of exhausted earth are ugly. Those who eat water excel in swimming and endure cold, those who eat earth are without desire and do not tire—*they do not breathe*—those who eat wood are strong but unrefined—*their vital essence is ungoverned*—those who eat grass are swift but foolish, those who eat mulberry leaves have silken threads like silkworms, those who eat meat are courageous and defensive, those who eat qi are spiritually enlightened and long-lived, those who eat grains are wise and clear-sighted, and those who eat nothing do not die but become divine."*

*The Huainanzi* states: *"Though strong yet not violent, this too is the appearance of the unrefined."*

Thus it is said: *"Among feathered creatures, there are three hundred and sixty, and the phoenix is their sovereign. Among furred creatures, there are three hundred and sixty, and the qilin is their sovereign. Among shelled creatures, there are three hundred and sixty, and the tortoise is their sovereign. Among creatures with hidden forms, there are three hundred and sixty, and humanity is their sovereign."* This is the beauty of Heaven and Earth.

Though their forms and kinds differ, the sovereign must act in accordance with the Dao/Way when moving and must rest in accordance with the Dao/Way, ever following nature without harming what is born. This is called *ren* and longevity.

*Yanyì* notes: *"As for the young, the strong, and the old—death is inevitable."*

Recorded in *Liezi* (missing character in *"Heavenly Blessing"* chapter): The Yellow Emperor said: *"When the spirit enters its gate and the bones return to their roots, what remains of me?"*

From birth to death, the Great Transformation has four stages: infancy, youth and vigor, old age, and death. In infancy, the qi is concentrated and the will is singular—harmony at its peak. Nothing harms it, and no virtue surpasses it. In youth and vigor, blood and qi overflow, desires and thoughts surge—things assail it, and virtue declines. In old age, desires and thoughts soften, the body nears rest—nothing precedes it. Though it does not reach the fullness of infancy, it is already distant from youth and vigor. In death, it returns to stillness, reaching its extreme.

Thus, all things revere the Dao/Way and honor virtue/power.

*Yanyì* notes: *"This is what Zhuangzi called the True Sovereign."* It also cites Zhuangzi’s *"True Steward"*:

*"One does not know what it is that commands, yet if there is a True Sovereign, it is only that its traces and succession are not grasped—how could it be otherwise than sovereign and minister?"* A True Sovereign indeed exists.

The Dao/Way is exalted, virtue/power is noble—none confer titles upon it, yet it is ever naturally so.

*Yanyì* notes: *"As in the case of the five ranks of duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron."*

Recorded: The Zhou established five ranks of nobility—duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron. The ancient kings’ laws also had five grades: sovereign, nobles, ministers and great officers, scholars, and commoners—including the sovereign himself.

In the world, the ruler governs not because he lacks talent or tools. When he selects and employs them, he then confers titles and honors, bestowing nobility and prestige. Yet this nobility and prestige have their limits. The Dao/Way gives birth to things and is revered by them. Virtue/power nurtures all things and is honored by them. Endlessly generating without cessation, the function of giving birth is eternally revered. Endlessly completing without exhaustion, the function of perfecting is eternally honored. How could there be any limit?

*Yanyì* notes: *"Mencius said: There is the noble title of Heaven, and there is the noble title of humanity."*

Recorded in *Mencius*, *"Telling Zigong of Proper Conduct"* (Upper): *"There is the noble title of Heaven, and there is the noble title of humanity. Ren, yi, zhong, and xin—joy in goodness without weariness—this is the noble title of Heaven. Dukes, ministers, and great officers—this is the noble title of humanity. The noble title of Heaven is earned through virtue/power, and the noble title of humanity is earned through emolument. The ancients cultivated their noble title of Heaven, and the noble title of humanity followed. Today’s people cultivate their noble title of Heaven to seek the noble title of humanity. Once they obtain the noble title of humanity, they abandon their noble title of Heaven—this is the greatest confusion, and it will surely lead to ruin."*

Now Mencius takes *ren*, *yi*, *zhong*, and *xin* as the noble title of Heaven. How much more so the Dao/Way and virtue/power, which surpass *ren* and *yi*! Thus it is said: *"The Dao/Way is exalted, virtue/power is noble—none confer titles upon it, yet it is ever naturally so."*

*Yanyì* notes: *"Zhuangzi fishing in the Pu River."*

Recorded in *Zhuangzi*, *"Autumn Water"* chapter: Pu is the name of a river, belonging to Dong Commandery—today’s Pu County in Puyang. The King of Chu (Chu King Wei) knew Zhuangzi was a sage of great insight, so he sent envoys to offer him the position of minister, first testing his intentions. He wished to entrust the governance of his realm to a worthy, for state affairs were burdensome and he bore many worries. The meaning is already fully elaborated; there is no need to repeat it.

*"To act without possession, to labor without reliance, to grow without domination—this is called the Mysterious Virtue."*

*Yanyì* notes: *"Retreating and hiding in secrecy—this is profound and distant."*

Recorded in *The System of the Classic of Changes*: The Master said: *"What is the *Yijing* for? It opens what is hidden and completes undertakings, encompassing the Dao/Way of all under Heaven. Such is its function. Thus, the sage uses it to harmonize the wills of all under Heaven, to establish the undertakings of all under Heaven, and to resolve the doubts of all under Heaven. Therefore, the virtue/power of the stalks is round and divine, the virtue/power of the trigrams is square and knowing, and the meanings of the six lines are easy yet profound. The sage uses this to purify the heart, retreating and hiding in secrecy, sharing in the joys and sorrows of the people. Divine insight knows the future, and knowledge preserves the past—who could rival this?"*

The ancient were the wise and enlightened, the sagely and martial yet without killing.

Originally, when Confucius spoke of *retreat and concealment in secrecy* (退藏於密), he referred to the ancient wise and enlightened sages, who without exception followed the Dao/Way of the *Yijing*, harmonizing their virtue/power with the divine knowledge of the trigrams and lines, purifying their hearts, nurturing their virtue/power, and retiring in secrecy—yet never revealing their traces.

Is this not the *profound virtue/power* (玄德)?

Under Heaven, there exists the *Beginning Chapter* (有始), the fifty-second chapter:

*"Block its *Yui* (兑), close its gates—then one’s entire life will not labor."*

Elaborated meaning: The six senses each have their own delight.

Recorded: The six senses (六根)—as the Left Venerable Master of the *Taiji* (太极) Confession states—are the cause of the entanglement of life, birth, and suffering. They arise from the three actions (三业): the six senses are the eye-sense (眼根), ear-sense (耳根), nose-sense (鼻根), tongue-sense (舌根), body-sense (身根), and mind-sense (意根). All senses give rise to all actions (业), hence it is said: the six senses are like plants and trees, producing all flowers and fruits, perpetually generating one another.

Elaborated meaning: The Yellow Emperor inquired about *governing the body* (治身) of the Dao/Way from Guangchengzi.

Recorded in *The Zhuangzi* (《庄子》□*On Nurturing the Perfect*—在宥篇): The meaning is already detailed in the *Recorded Sayings* (义中载之), and thus it is not repeated here.

Elaborated meaning: This is called *having the Joyous* (兑). When the Joyous is present and the heart (心) emerges, it engages with things (物). If one blocks the Joyous so that it does not flow, then the heart will not emerge.

Recorded in *The Sayings on the Hexagrams* (《易说卦》): "Joy is spoken of as *Joyous* (兑), which is the marsh. Nothing delights all things as much as the marsh does." Again, *Joyous* (兑) is likened to the eye, the gate, and the mouth, and thus it warns against their closure and the disasters that follow. If this gate of disaster is applied to a state, governance will falter; if practiced in the body, the Dao/Way will decline. If properly closed and sealed, then the body will be at ease and the state will be orderly. To open the Joyous and advance its affairs will never bring salvation in the end.

Elaborated meaning: Once the five desires’ gate is opened, the six dusts’ affairs are accomplished, and the mind and spirit grow weary within.

Recorded in *The Zhuangzi*: The words of Zhiqi (盗跖) admonishing Confucius: "Now I shall tell you of human nature: the eyes desire to see colors, the ears desire to hear sounds, the nose desires to smell fragrances, the tongue desires to taste flavors, and the will desires fulfillment. These are the six dusts’ affairs."

This is the original language from the *Scripture of the Gathering of the Jade Emperor* (玉皇本《行集经》), Chapter One: At that time, the Jade Emperor issued a grand and wondrous sound, addressing all the celestial beings and holy assemblies of the Ten Directions: "You must listen carefully. These guilty beings, across countless kalpas, though lacking in wisdom, have committed the ten evil deeds. The six dusts pervade their defilement, the three actions bind them tightly, and they indulge their hearts without restraint, never awakening. Their hidden sins and manifest transgressions accumulate day by day, month by month.

What are the six dusts? They are the dusts of the six senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.

These guilty beings, having long fallen into the sufferings of kalpas, indulged their dust-obscured nature, thus becoming thoroughly defiled by the six dusts and entangled by the three actions. These are all the types of transgressions.

Elaborated meaning: There was a man named Zhang Bao in the Song Dynasty.

Recorded: Zhang Bao was a man from Chengdu. He admired the wife of the magistrate of Huayang County. He made me, the fifth chapter of the *Jie* (介) preface, stand out.

If I were to have knowledge, I would walk the Great Dao,
Yet only fear to act with benevolence.

**Elaborated meaning:** This is how *Niè Quē* questioned *Wáng Ní*:
*"Do you know what all things hold in common?"*
Recorded from the text of *Zhuāngzǐ’s* ["齐物论"] *On Equalizing Things*:
Niè Quē was a disciple of Wáng Ní.
Wáng Ní replied: *"How should I know?"*
*"Do you know what you do not know?"*
*"How should I know?"*
*"Then do things have no knowing?"*
*"How should I know?"*
*"Well, let me try to speak of it.*
*How do I know that what I call knowing is not ignorance?"*

The Great Dao is most level, yet people love shortcuts.

**Elaborated meaning:** As with *Tán Tái Miè Míng*, who never took shortcuts.
Recorded from the words of the *Lúnyǔ’s* ["雍也"] *Yōng Yě* (Sixth Chapter):
Zǐyóu, named Yǎn, styled Zǐyǔ, was a disciple of Confucius.
He served as magistrate of Wǔchéng, a lower city of Lǔ.
The Master said: *"Have you found a worthy man there?"*
He replied: *"There is Tán Tái Miè Míng—he never takes shortcuts.
Unless it is official business, he never enters my home.
His courtyard is always swept clean, his fields well tilled,
And his granaries are always empty."*

**Elaborated meaning:** Such as the excesses of *Zhòu*—his palaces and pavilions,
The *Chu*’s *Chānghuá*, and *Qín*’s *Āfáng*—all are of this kind.
Recorded:
*"Palaces and pavilions"*—from the *Shūjīng’s* ["泰誓上"] *Tài Shì (Upper)*:
King Wǔ said: *"Now King Zhòu of the Shāng,
Does not revere the Highest Heaven,
Brings calamity upon the people,
Drowns himself in wine and debauchery.
He indulges in licentiousness, corrupts women,
Commits atrocities—punishing whole clans,
Condemning officials by generations—
His palaces, pavilions, ponds, and extravagant attire
Exhaust the common folk.
He burns and roasts loyal ministers,
Dismembers pregnant women.
The August Heaven, enraged, commands my father, the Duke,
To solemnly enforce Heaven’s might—
The great vengeance has yet to be fulfilled."*

And the *Chu*’s *Chānghuá*—from the *Chūnqiū*, *Zhāo Gōng* Year 7:
The Lord of Chu built the *Chānghuá* terrace,
Wishing to sacrifice the feudal lords upon it.
*"Fall"* here means "sacrifice."
As in *Hú Zēng’s* poetic history:
*"Endless withered grass buries Chānghuá,*
*Laughing at King Líng’s past extravagance—
*Before the platform’s earth dried, the music ceased,
*Alas, his body lies in a commoner’s grave."*

And *Qín*’s *Āfáng*—from poetic history:
*"Newly built Āfáng’s walls were yet un-dried,
When Pèngyōng’s army already entered Cháng’ān.
The emperors drained the people’s strength for grand schemes—
Great undertakings crumble as sand, not hard to foresee."*

This speaks of rulers who neglect the roots,
Pursuing only splendor,
Nearly destroying the foundation—
How can this be a lasting Dao?

**Elaborated meaning:** Towering halls and carved walls.
Recorded from the *Shàngshū’s* ["五子之歌"] *Wǔzǐ’s Song*.

「The Five Sons were the younger brothers of Tàikāng.  When Tàikāng sat upon the throne in name only, indulging in ease and pleasure to extinguish his own virtue, they composed this song to admonish him.  It says:

*"The Way teaches thus:*
*Within, he indulged in wanton excess,*
*Without, he hunted beasts without restraint.*
*Drunk on wine, lost in music,*
*Towering halls and carved walls—*
*One such act, and none shall escape ruin."*

**Elaborated meaning:** Fields and rice paddies left barren.
This is how the poets censured King Yōu.
Recorded from the *Máo Shī*’s ["小雅·楚茨"] *Xiǎoyǎ·Chǔcú*, censuring King Yōu.

*"Excessive governance and heavy taxation,*
*Fields and rice paddies left barren,*
*Famine and pestilence descend,*
*The people perish and flee.*
*Sacrifices fail to nourish the spirits,*
*Thus the virtuous ones ponder the ancient ways.*

*Clad in fine embroidery,*
*Wearing sharp blades,*
*Disdaining ordinary food,*
*Yet wealth overflows.*
*This is called ‘robber’s ostentation’—*
*How can it be the true Dao?"*

**Elaborated meaning:** Clad in fine embroidery, like Emperor Yángdì of Sui, who clipped silk to make flower-like adornments for his dragon boat.

Recorded: In the first year of Sui’s *Dàyì* era (605 CE), the fifth month, Emperor Yángdì constructed the Western Gardens, two hundred *lǐ* in circumference. Within it lay a man-made sea, ten *lǐ* or more in breadth. He built the Fāngzhàng, Pénglái, and Yíngzhōu mountains, each a hundred *zǐ* in height, with pavilions, towers, and palaces dotting their peaks. To the north of the sea, he dug a canal winding into its heart. Sixteen gateways of the Green Canal were all built along its banks, each presided over by a consort of the fourth rank. The gardens were lavish beyond measure. When the trees within the palace were trimmed, he would clip silk to fashion flower and leaf decorations, replacing them whenever the colors faded. Within the ponds, he similarly clipped silk to create lotus and water chestnut plants, exchanging them for new ones when their hues grew dull. The sixteen gateways vied with each other in offering exquisite delicacies, seeking favor through extravagant displays. The Emperor delighted in nightly excursions through the gardens with thousands of attendants, composing the *Qīngyè Yóu* ("Clear Night Journey") song to be performed on horseback. In the eighth month, the Emperor traveled to Jiāngdū. When he boarded the dragon boat there, it was four tiers high, forty-five *zǐ* in height, and two hundred *zǐ* long, with a main hall, inner hall, and court chamber on the topmost level. The middle two tiers housed a hundred and twenty rooms, all adorned with gold and jade. The lowest tier served as quarters for the eunuch attendants. The Empress rode in a floating pavilion, its design slightly smaller than the Emperor’s. There were also nine *Fújǐng* ("Floating Scenes") vessels, three tiers high, each a water palace. Thousands more boats carried the consorts, royal princes, officials, monks, nuns, Daoists, and foreign guests. Altogether, they employed over eighty thousand oarsmen, all dressed in brocade robes. A thousand more vessels bore the escorting guards, their prows and sterns linked in an unbroken line for two hundred *lǐ*. Cavalry patrolled the shores on either side. Every prefecture and county within five hundred *lǐ* was commanded to offer tribute—some sending as much as a hundred cartloads of the rarest aquatic and terrestrial delicacies. The palace women, sated with drink, would often discard the remainder of their meals in the dirt before departing.

**Elaborated meaning:** The Jin lord Hécāi made a purple silk windbreak forty *lǐ* long, while Shí Chóng made a brocade windbreak fifty *lǐ* long. Recorded from the *Jìn Shū*: Shí Chóng, styled Jìlún, was by nature extravagant. At that time, the Jin lord Hécāi had made a forty-*lǐ* purple silk windbreak, and Chóng, to surpass him in wealth, made a fifty-*lǐ* brocade windbreak. Later, when his concubine Lǜzhū was executed, he went to the Eastern Market and sighed, *"These slaves profit from my wealth!"* The executioners replied, *"You knew wealth could bring harm—why not disperse it earlier?"* Chóng had no answer.

**Elaborated meaning:** The Later Han official Mǎ Liáo submitted a memorial stating that in the capital, men favored wide sleeves. Recorded: In the first year of the *Jiànchū* era (76 CE) under Emperor Zhāng of Later Han, he issued an edict to correct customs and promote virtue, which must have its origin. The *Shū* says: *"King Wú of the State of Wú loved swordsmen, and the people were many with wounds."* *"King Fēn of the State of Zhāo delighted in slender waists, and many starved to death in the palace."* The people of Cháng’ān would say: *"In the capital, men favor tall hairdos—so the four quarters raise their hair by a foot."* *"In the capital, men favor broad eyebrows—so the four quarters pluck theirs to half their foreheads."* *"In the capital, men favor wide sleeves—so the four quarters wear entire bolts of silk."* Though these words seem like jest, they reflect reality.

**Elaborated meaning:** Wearing sharp blades, like King Wú of Wú, who commissioned the smith Gān Jiāng to forge swords. The swords came in two forms: one called *Gān Jiāng*, the other *Mòyē*. The earlier records mention the same.

Recorded from the *Zhuāngzǐ* ["说剑篇"] *Shuō Jiàn* chapter: In ancient times, King Wén of Zhāo—also known as Zhāo Hùiwén Wáng—was the son of Zhāo Líng Wáng. He loved swords, and three thousand or more swordsmen gathered at his gates, day and night clashing before him, with hundreds dying or wounded. Yet he never tired of it. Thus for three years, until his realm declined and the feudal lords conspired against him.

**Elaborated meaning:** If Hé Zéng of the Jin dynasty ate ten thousand coins’ worth of food daily, he would still claim there was no place to set his chopsticks. Recorded: During the reign of Jin Wǔdì, the Chancellor Hé Zéng, styled Yǐngkǎo, consumed ten thousand coins’ worth of food daily, yet still complained there was no place to set his chopsticks. He would not eat steamed buns unless they were cut into ten pieces. At that time, the general Qín Xiù remarked, *"Zéng’s arrogance and excess are beyond measure—he should be posthumously named with a shameful title."* A title that does not match the person’s deeds is called *miù* (谬), and one who flouts order and behaves wantonly is called *chǒu* (丑).

**Elaborated meaning:** King Zhòu of the Shang dynasty hoarded the wealth of Lùtái and amassed the grain of Jiǔqiáo. Recorded: King Zhòu of the Shang accumulated wealth without dispersing it, filled his granaries without knowing contentment. The *Shàngshū* states: When King Wǔ of the Zhōu defeated the Shang, he declared, *"Scatter the wealth of Lùtái and distribute the grain of Jiǔqiáo, bestow bounty upon all under heaven, and the myriad peoples will rejoice and submit."*»

**Chapter Fifty-Four: "The Well-Established Shall Not Be Uprooted"**
From *The Collected Works of the Reclusive Gentleman Wáng Shǒuzhèng of Wǔfēng*

The well-established shall not be uprooted,
The well-embraced shall not be lost—
Then descendants shall never cease their sacrifices.

**Elaborated Meaning:** First, establish the roots firmly, then cultivate the branches.

Quoted from *The Zhuāngzi* [□ *Heaven and Earth*]:
In the age of supreme virtue,
There is no veneration of the worthy,
No employment of the capable.
The ruler is like a branch marking the way,
The people like wild deer.
This speaks of the ruler’s non-action above,
And the people’s natural simplicity below—
Like wild deer, they are free from royal rites.

**Elaborated Meaning:** Those who embrace the people with the Dao
Shall have the hundred folk return and never depart.

Quoted: The *Elaborated Meaning* takes those who embrace the people with the Dao—
Like the Great King (Tàiwáng)—
As the very model of a Dao-bearing ruler.
When he left Yín and they followed him as to market,
This is called the hundred folk returning and never departing.
Thus it is said: *The well-embraced shall not be lost.*

**Elaborated Meaning:** Those who with the Dao embrace the Primordial and hold to Oneness
Shall have their spirit complete and never lost.

Quoted: The *Zhuāngzi* [□ *On Nurturing Life*] says:
Guāngchéngzǐ spoke: *"Come, I shall tell you of the supreme Dao."*
And again: *"I hold to its Oneness and dwell in its harmony."*
Thus I have cultivated my body for twelve hundred years,
Yet my form has never decayed.
The Yellow Emperor bowed twice and knelt in homage, saying:
*"This is what we call Heaven!"*
Thus the *Elaborated Meaning* cites those who with the Dao embrace the Primordial and hold to Oneness—
Their spirit is complete and never lost.
Guāngchéngzǐ is the very model of one who with the Dao embraces the Primordial and holds to Oneness.
To cultivate the body for twelve hundred years without decay—
This is called the spirit complete and never lost.
Thus it is said: *The well-embraced shall not be lost.*

**Elaborated Meaning:** When the Great King dwelt in Yín,
The Rú people invaded him.
He served them with hides, jade, and pearls,
Yet could not escape.

Quoted from *The Mèngzǐ* [□ *Sentences on King Huì of Lǐ, Lower*]:
Téng was a small state.
If it exhausted its strength to serve a great power,
It could not escape—how then could it?
Mèngzǐ replied:
*"In ancient times, the Great King dwelt in Yín.
The Rú people invaded him.
He served them with hides and jade—
Yet could not escape.
He served them with dogs and horses—
Yet could not escape.
He served them with pearls and jade—
Yet could not escape.
Then he gathered his elders and told them:
'What the Rú people desire is our land.
I have heard: A gentleman does not use what nourishes others to harm them.
My lords, what fear is there of lacking a ruler?
I shall depart.'
He left Yín, crossed the Liáng Mountains,
And settled beneath Qí Mountain.
The people of Yín said:
'A benevolent man—
We must not lose him!'
Those who followed him came as to market."*

The span of the Zhou Dynasty’s reign extended through the ages of King Wén, King Wǔ, King Chéng, and King Kāng—all sovereigns who embraced the **Dao** and cultivated **virtue**. Thus, their descendants succeeded one another for thirty-seven generations, spanning eight hundred and sixty-seven years. Their enduring prosperity and unbroken sacrifices were such that even when later rulers desecrated ancestral temples, the **sacrificial rites** to **Hòujì**, King Wén, and the **sacrifices at the altar of heaven** (*jiāosì*) never ceased.

The *Yǎn Yì* states: *"Even after the destruction of ancestral temples, the sacrifices to Hòujì, King Wén, and the **sacrifices at the altar of heaven** were never interrupted."*

From the *Shǐjì* records: When Confucius was in Qí, he lodged in the outer guesthouse. Qí Jinggōng visited him. After the formal exchanges between host and guest concluded, an attendant reported: *"A Zhou envoy has just arrived, saying that a calamity has befallen one of the ancestral temples of the former kings."* Jinggōng inquired: *"Which king’s temple has been stricken?"*

Confucius replied: *"This must be the temple of King Lǐ."*

The duke asked: *"How do you know?"*

Confucius said: *"The *Shī* says: ‘Majestic, O Heaven above, your commands are without error. Heaven rewards virtue with virtue.’ This is a lost poem. ‘Majestic’ (*huánghuáng*) means splendid. ‘Error’ (*tè*) means deviation. Calamity follows the same principle. King Lǐ abandoned the institutions of Kings Wén and Wǔ, introducing dark yellow and extravagant adornments, towering palaces, and lavish carriages and horses—none of which could be rectified. Thus, Heaven’s punishment rightly fell upon his temple. This divination aligns with the signs."*

The duke asked: *"Why did Heaven punish his temple instead of his person?"*

Confucius replied: *"It was for the sake of Kings Wén and Wǔ. If Heaven had punished his person, would not the descendants of Wén and Wǔ have been extinguished? Therefore, the calamity struck his temple to expose his transgressions."*

Soon, an attendant reported: *"The temple stricken was indeed that of King Lǐ."* Jinggōng rose in astonishment, bowed twice, and said: *"Truly, the wisdom of the Sage surpasses others far beyond measure. If his teachings were followed throughout the world, his **virtue** would be universal."*

「Elucidating its meaning, it states: *"When kin and relatives are harmonious, and undertakings are well-ordered, **virtue** is cultivated."*

Quoting *The Book of Documents [□Yáo Diǎn]*:
*"He [Yáo] selected and appointed men of outstanding **virtue**, thus bringing harmony to the nine clans."* The annotation reads: *"This means Yáo could recognize and employ men of exceptional **virtue**, thereby fostering harmony among his high ancestors, descendants, and all collateral relations—together comprising the nine clans."*

With the nine clans in harmony, he governed the people with clarity, making them bright and well-ordered. He united all under Heaven in concord, and the common folk thrived in their changing times.

Zhang’s interpretation states: *"Yáo cultivated **virtue** through selecting and appointing men of outstanding **virtue**—this was his way of perfecting himself. To bring harmony to the nine clans was his way of perfecting his family. To govern the people with clarity was his way of perfecting his state. To unite all under Heaven in concord was his way of perfecting the world. This is the proper sequence: first perfect oneself, then harmonize the family, then govern the state, and finally bring peace to the world."*

Elucidating its meaning further, it states: *"The blessings of accumulated goodness extend to future generations."* Quoting *The Commentary on the Hexagrams of the Yijing [Kūn Guà Wén Yán]*:
*"A family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant blessings.
A family that accumulates evil will surely have lingering calamities."*

When a subject slays his lord, or a son slays his father, such deeds are not the result of a single day or night. Their origins lie in gradual decline. From failing to discern **virtue** early, one may say: *"Those who govern states and families can they not take warning?"*

The extended meaning states: *"All treasures flourish abundantly."* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Gēngsāng Chú*]:

The Master said: *"How do my disciples differ from me? When spring qi arises, all grasses sprout; when autumn arrives, all treasures mature."*

The extended meaning states: *"This is what is meant by using its remnants to govern people."* *"This is what is meant by using its dregs to govern the state."* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Ràng Wáng Piān*]:

*"The true Dao is used to cultivate the self. Its remnants are used to govern the state; its dregs are used to govern the world. Therefore, one observes the self to understand the self, the family to understand the family, the village to understand the village, the state to understand the state, and the world to understand the world. How do I know the world is thus? By this."*

The extended meaning states: *"The Yijing says: 'Observe my life, and the gentleman will have no blame.'" It is a matter of reflecting inward and seeking within oneself."* Quoting the *Guàn* hexagram’s ninth-five line:

*"Nine-five: Observe my life, and the gentleman will have no blame.*
*The Commentary says: 'Observe my life'—this means observing the people.*
*Master Bào’s interpretation says: This nine-five line, with its gentle yet upright position, embodies the just and central. It embodies yielding compliance to cultivate virtue, and uses rectitude to govern the people, becoming the sovereign of great observation. Yet those below follow those above, like shadows responding to form; the people follow the ruler, like clay shaped by the potter’s wheel. If you show them evil, evil will take root; if you lead them with goodness, goodness will flourish. Transformation begins from the self, and its influence extends to the four seas. To examine one’s virtue, first observe the people. When the gentleman’s conduct is exemplary, there will be no blame.*

*Thus, this line from the *Guàn* hexagram’s ninth-five is cited to verify the meaning of 'How do I know the world is thus?'—speaking of the five methods of observation, and knowing the world through observing its people."*

**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Depth of Contained Virtue**
*"The depth of contained virtue is like that of an infant. Poisonous insects do not sting, fierce beasts do not harm, and predatory birds do not snatch."*

The extended meaning states: *"If life’s blessings increase daily, the depth of virtue will diminish."* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Dé Chóng Fú Piān*]:

Huizi said to Zhuangzi: *"Is it true that humans have no emotions?"*
Zhuangzi replied: *"Yes."*
Huizi said: *"If humans have no emotions, why call them human?"*
Zhuangzi said: *"The Dao gives them form, Heaven gives them shape—how could they not be called human?"*
Huizi said: *"If they are called human, how can they lack emotions?"*
Zhuangzi said: *"This is not what I call emotion. What I call 'no emotion' is that humans do not let their likes and dislikes internally harm themselves; they follow nature without excess."*

The extended meaning states: *"Silent, as if having lost their mate."* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Qí Wù Lùn*]:

Nánguò Zǐqí sat leaning against his elbow, gazing upward and sighing deeply, silent as if having lost his mate. This describes the perfected sage, silent as if having lost their mate—like an infant’s innocence, so nothing can harm them.

The extended meaning states: *"Their harmony is in perfect accord with all things; who could harm them?"* Quoting *Liezi* [□ *Huángdì Piān*:

Zhào Xiāngzǐ led ten thousand soldiers on a hunt in the mountains, setting fires to drive game. The flames scorched a hundred *li*. A man emerged from a rocky crevice, moving with the smoke’s rise and fall. The soldiers took him for a ghost. After the fire passed, he emerged slowly, as if untouched. Xiāngzǐ was astonished and detained him. Upon close inspection, his form, color, and orifices were human; his breath, voice, and manner were human. Xiāngzǐ asked: *"What way did you dwell in stone? What way did you pass through fire?"*
The man replied: *"What do you call 'stone'? What do you call 'fire'?"*
Xiāngzǐ said: *"What you emerged from was stone; what you passed through was fire."*
The man said: *"I do not know."*
When Wèi Wénhòu heard of this, he asked Zǐxià: *"Who is this man?"*
Zǐxià replied: *"Based on what I’ve heard from the Master, those in perfect harmony are in perfect accord with all things. Nothing can harm them, so they can wander among metals and stones, tread upon water and fire—all is possible."*
Wénhòu said: *"Why doesn’t my teacher do this?"*
Zǐxià replied: *"He has hollowed his heart and discarded wisdom—I cannot do it either. Still, I will speak of it when I have leisure."*
Wénhòu said: *"Why doesn’t my teacher do this?"*
Zǐxià replied: *"The Master can do it but chooses not to."*
Wénhòu was greatly pleased.

The extended meaning states: *"Like in the Spring and Autumn Annals, where Dù Bǐ compared with the daughter of the Duke of Chu, and bore a son, Wén."* Quoting *Spring and Autumn* (Lí Gōng 21st year): The meaning is already recorded; no need for repetition.

The extended meaning states: *"Like in the *Shijing*, which says: 'When Houji was born to Jiāngléi, he was abandoned in a narrow lane, where cows and sheep trampled him. He was abandoned in a dense forest, where loggers felled trees. He was abandoned on the ice, where a bird sheltered him with its wings; the bird flew away, and Houji cried.'"* Quoting *Máo Shī* [*Dà Yá* • *Shēng Mín*]:

*"Revering the ancestral Houji, born to Jiāngléi, the achievements of Wén and Wǔ began with him. Thus, he was matched with Heaven. Abandoned in a narrow lane, cows and sheep trampled him. Abandoned in a dense forest, loggers felled trees. Abandoned on the ice, a bird sheltered him with its wings; the bird flew away, and Houji cried. Though his bones were frail and his sinews soft, his grip was firm. Before knowing the union of male and female, his vigor was already strong—the peak of vital essence. He cried all day, yet his throat did not grow hoarse—the peak of harmony."*

The extended meaning states: *"Zhuangzi said: 'The true person’s breath originates from the heels; the common person’s breath originates from the throat.'"*
Quoting *Zhuangzi* [*Dà Zōngshī Piān*]:

*"The ancient true persons slept without dreaming, awoke without worry, ate without relishing flavor, and breathed deeply. This describes the inner breath. The true person’s breath originates from the heels—the root of the feet. The common person’s breath is shallow and labored, originating from the throat."*

「When the throat is constricted, the voice falters.
　　As if taking a single step.
　　The throat, being the throat, when *qi* and breath are unregulated,
　　Within the throat, it is always as if obstructed by a frog.
　　Those whose desires are deep, their *heavenly mechanism* is shallow.
　　Knowing harmony as constancy, knowing constancy as clarity,
　　Nourishing life as auspiciousness, the heart directing *qi* as strength.
　　When things are at their peak, they begin to decay—
　　This is called *not-Dao*, and *not-Dao* perishes early.
　　The extended meaning states: *"It is not merely without benefit but also harmful."*
　　Quoting *Mencius* [*Gōngsūnchǒu Shàng*]:

*"There must be some action, yet do not force it—
　　Do not forget the heart, yet do not aid its growth.
　　Do not be like the people of Song:
　　The people of Song had one who pitied his sprouts for not growing,
　　So he bent them over—
　　Weary, he returned home and told his family,
　　'Sick today—I helped the sprouts grow!'
　　His son hurried to see, and the sprouts had withered.
　　Few in the world do not aid the sprouts' growth.
　　Those who think it useless and abandon them are like those who do not weed the fields.
　　Those who aid their growth are like those who bend them over—
　　Not merely useless, but also harmful.
　　Yet if one nourishes them directly, they will also thrive.
　　This is also from *Gōngsūnchǒu*’s words.
　　Mencius answered *Gōngsūnchǒu*’s question:
　　'Dare I ask what *hàorán zhī qì* is?'
　　He said: 'It is difficult to speak of.
　　As for its nature, it is supremely vast and supremely firm—
　　Nourished directly without harm, it fills the space between heaven and earth.'
　　*Programzi* said: 'Heaven and man are one.
　　No further distinction.
　　This *hàorán zhī qì* is my own *qi*—
　　Nourished without harm, it fills the space between heaven and earth.
　　Yet when obscured by private intentions, it contracts and suddenly knows its smallness.'
　　The extended meaning states: *"The *Shū* says: 'Doing good brings a hundred blessings.'*
　　Quoting *The Book of Documents* [*Yī Xuàn Piān*]:

*'Alas! The succeeding king must guard his person,
　　And reflect upon this.
　　The sacred admonitions are vast and resplendent,
　　The praiseworthy words are clearly manifest.
　　Only the Supreme Lord is not constant—
　　Doing good brings a hundred blessings,
　　Doing evil brings a hundred calamities.
　　If your *virtue* is not small, all the states rejoice.
　　If your *virtue* is not great, your lineage will collapse.'
　　The extended meaning states: *"The Dao exceeds the age of the ancient past yet does not grow old."*
　　Quoting *Zhuangzi* [*Yìng Dì Wáng Piān*]:

*"From its own origin and root,
　　Before heaven and earth existed, it has always been.
　　The divine spirits and divine lords,
　　Generating heaven and earth,
　　Are within the *Great Ultimate*—the *Great Ultimate*, five *qi* energies.
　　Above them yet not exalted, within the *Six Extremes*—the *Six Extremes*, the *Six Harmonies*.
　　Below them yet not abyssal, born before heaven and earth yet not ancient,
　　Exceeding the age of the ancient past yet not growing old.
　　This has already been recorded in the *Dao Jing* [*Wù Hùnchéng Zhāng*], so no need to repeat it.
　　The chapter on *Knowers Do Not Speak* (*Zhī Zhě Bù Yán*, Chapter 56):

*'Knowers do not speak; speakers do not know.'*
　　The extended meaning states: *"Thus, the Sage of Confucius wished for no speech."*
　　Quoting *The Analects* [*Yáng Huò Shíqī Piān*]:

*'The Master said: 'I wish to speak not at all.'
　　Zigong said: 'If you do not speak, how shall we, your junior disciples, transmit your teachings?'
　　The Master said: 'How does heaven speak? The four seasons follow their course,
　　And all things are born. How does heaven speak?'
　　The extended meaning states: *"Mencius did not enjoy debate."*
　　Quoting *Mencius* [*Téng Wén Gōng Zhāngjù Xià*]:

*'I also wish to rectify the hearts of men,
　　To dispel perverse doctrines,
　　To repel false practices,
　　To banish licentious speech,
　　So as to uphold the teachings of the Three Sages—
　　Do I enjoy debate? I do not!
　　I am compelled by necessity.'
　　The extended meaning states: *"Rectify the form to comprehend things."*
　　Quoting *Zhuangzi* [*Tián Zǐ Fāng Piān*]:

*'Clear and receptive, allowing things to be contained.
　　Things have no inherent Dao—
　　Rectify the form to awaken them,
　　And people’s intentions will dissolve—
　　No choice remains, how could it be named?
　　This has already been detailed in the *Dao Jing*’s eighth chapter, so no need to repeat it.'
　　The extended meaning states: *"Seeing the Dao with one’s eyes."*
　　Quoting *Zhuangzi* [*Tián Zǐ Fāng Piān*]:

*'Zhongni saw it yet did not speak.
　　Zilu said: 'My teacher has long wished to see Wen Bo Xuezi.
　　Yet seeing him, he says nothing—why is this?'
　　Zhongni said: 'If one like that person exists,
　　The Dao is preserved by a single glance—
　　It cannot even be contained by sound.'
　　The extended meaning states: *"The Sage of *Wuwei* was asked three questions yet gave no answer."*
　　Quoting *Zhuangzi* [*Zhī Běi Yóu Piān*]:

*'Zhīběi wandered above the *Mysterious Waters*,
　　Ascended the mound of the *Hidden Well*,
　　And just happened upon the Sage of *Wuwei*.
　　Zhīběi asked the Sage of *Wuwei*: 'I wish to ask you,
　　What thoughts and deliberations lead to knowing the Dao?
　　What attire and conduct ensure the Dao’s ease?
　　What path and method attain the Dao?'
　　The Sage of *Wuwei* answered none of the three questions,
　　Not that he did not answer, but that he did not know how.
　　Zhīběi could not ask further, so he returned to the south of the *White Waters*,
　　Ascended the mound of *Húxiá*,
　　And beheld *Kuáng Qu* there.
　　Zhīběi asked him with these same words.
　　*Kuáng Qu* said: 'Ah! I know it.
　　I would tell you, but in the midst of speaking, I forget what I wished to say.'
　　Zhīběi could not ask further, so he returned to the *Imperial Palace*,
　　And saw the Yellow Emperor, asking him.
　　The Yellow Emperor said: 'Without thought or deliberation, one begins to know the Dao.
　　Without attire or conduct, one begins to ensure the Dao’s ease.
　　Without path or method, one begins to attain the Dao.'
　　Zhīběi asked the Yellow Emperor: 'You and I know it,
　　Yet he and he do not—who is correct?'
　　The Yellow Emperor said: 'That Sage of *Wuwei* is truly the Dao.
　　*Kuáng Qu* resembles it.
　　You and I are far from it.
　　The *Way* of the Sage is the teaching of silence—
　　Thus knowers do not speak, and speakers do not know,
　　So the Sage acts through the *Dao* of unspeaking.'
　　The extended meaning states: *"Wang Ni was asked four questions yet gave no answer."*
　　Quoting *Zhuangzi* [*Yìng Dì Wáng Piān*]:

*'Kē Què asked Wang Ni four questions yet received no answer.
　　Kē Què then leapt with great joy and went to tell Pú Yī Zi.
　　Pú Yī Zi said: 'Now you know it?'
　　The extended meaning states: *"Even those who recognize sound cannot transmit it with their mouths."*

「Quoting *Mencius* [*Lí Lóu Zhāngjù Shàng*]:

*"Shī Kuàng’s* [1] *acuteness of hearing could not harmonize the five tones without the six pitch-pipes. Shī Kuàng was the music master of Jìn, a connoisseur of sound. Yet even he, with his mastery of the six pitch-pipes, could not rectify the five tones without first attaining them in his mind and responding with his hands. Who then could truly transmit those subtle, refined, and resonant tones within the five tones?*

*The extended meaning states: *"The wheelwright’s craft cannot be spoken of."*

Quoting from *Zhuangzi* [*Tiāndào Piān*]:

*"Huan Gōng of Qí, whose personal name was Xiao. He was reading in the hall above, while the wheelwright Lún Biān was carving wheels below. Lún Biān put down his mallet and chisel, ascended, and asked Huan Gōng: 'May I boldly inquire—what is the speech you are reading?' Huan Gōng replied: 'It is the speech of the Sage.' Lún Biān asked: 'Is the Sage still alive?' Huan Gōng said: 'He has already died.' Lún Biān said: 'Then what you read is merely the leavings and dregs of the ancients.' Huan Gōng said: 'My lord reads the books, how dare the wheelwright comment? If he has understanding, let him speak; if not, let him die.' Lún Biān said: 'I observe it through my own craft. When carving wheels, if I proceed too slowly, the wood becomes soft yet unyielding; if too swiftly, it becomes bitter yet does not penetrate. Neither too slow nor too swift, I attain it with my hands and resonate it in my mind—yet my mouth cannot speak it. There is a measure inherent within this process. I cannot teach my craft to my son, nor can my son receive it from me, hence at seventy years old I am still a wheelwright. The ancients’ true teachings could not be transmitted, so they died with them. Thus what you read is merely the leavings and dregs of the ancients.'*

*Therefore, it cannot be grasped as near or distant, beneficial or harmful, honored or degraded—yet for this very reason, it is held in highest esteem by all under Heaven.*

*The extended meaning states: *"If* [Zǐ] *Lièzi lived in the Jìng gardens for forty years, yet no one recognized him."*

Quoting from *Lièzi* [*Tiānrú Piān*]:

*"Zǐ Lièzi dwelled in the Jìng gardens for forty years, and no one knew him. The rulers and ministers of the state regarded him no differently than the common folk."*

*The extended meaning states: *"If* [Zǐ] *Xuānwáng of Qí wished to govern all under Heaven and bestowed upon Mèngzǐ a residence, maintaining his disciples with ten thousand* [qìng] *of grain—six* [hú] *four* [dòu] *for one* [qìng]—*and ordered all ministers and the people to emulate their conduct."*

Quoting from *Mencius* [*Gōngsūn Chǒu Zhāngjù Xià*]:

*"Xuānwáng of Qí later told Shǐ Zǐ: 'I wish to govern all under Heaven and bestow upon Mèngzǐ a residence, maintaining his disciples with ten thousand* [qìng] *of grain—six* [hú] *four* [dòu] *for one* [qìng]—*and order all ministers and the people to emulate their conduct.' Shǐ Zǐ, why do you not tell me this?" Shǐ Zǐ relayed the words through Chén Zǐ, and Chén Zǐ told Mèngzǐ. Mèngzǐ said: 'Indeed, Shǐ Zǐ knows not why it is impossible. If I were to desire wealth, I would decline ten thousand* [qìng] *and accept a thousand—would that not be to desire wealth?'*

*The extended meaning states: *"Mèngzǐ spoke of what people truly honor—it is not the kind of honor they seek."*

Quoting from *Mencius* [*Gàozǐ Zhāngjù Shàng*]:

*"Mèngzǐ said: 'To desire honor is the common aspiration of all people. Everyone has something they honor in themselves—it is just that they do not reflect upon it. What people truly honor is not the kind of honor they seek. Zhào Mèng’s* [2] *honor can be taken away by Zhào Mèng himself. The note states: Zhào Mèng’s honor refers to the honor bestowed upon him by his rank and title, while* [liáng] *honor is the inherent goodness of virtue. Zhào Mèng was a minister of Jìn. If he could confer rank and wealth upon others to make them honored, he could also strip them of it to make them degraded. If it were* [liáng] *honor, how could others degrade him?'*

*The extended meaning states: *"The* [Hàn] *Filempéror heard of* [Héshàng Gōng] *tying reeds into a hut by the riverbank."*

*Quoted from* [Zhuǎn] *Chronicles* [Běnjì] *as recorded. The meaning has already been elaborated upon in earlier passages and will not be repeated here.*

*Extended Meaning states:* Mencius said: *"Rectify the ruler, and the realm is settled."*

Quoted from the *Mencius*—[□离娄上] [上] *Chapter*—text.

Mencius said:
*"One cannot discuss music with those unworthy of harmony,
Nor debate governance with those unfit to rule.
Only the great sage can correct the ruler’s unrighteous heart.
If the ruler is virtuous, none will fail to be virtuous;
If the ruler is righteous, none will fail to be righteous;
If the ruler is rectified, none will fail to be rectified.
Rectify the ruler, and the realm is settled."*

*Extended Meaning states:* The *Three Stratagems* [三略] and *Nine Variations* [九奇]—
Calming strife to pacify rebels—
are the achievements of martial prowess.

Quoted:
*The Three Stratagems* [三略]—
Han Lord Hou [留侯] Zhang Zifang [张子房], at the Weiyang Bridge [圯桥] in Xiaopi [下邳], encountered Huangshigong [黄石公],
who taught him the *Three Stratagems*, saying:
*"You have obtained them,
and you shall surely become a teacher of emperors and kings—
also a master of tactical maneuvers [机铃] in warfare.*
Zhang Yi [子牙] applied them,
assisting King Wu to conquer Shang and subdue Jie [纣] and thus complete the royal enterprise.
Zhang Zifang applied them,
aiding the Han Ancestor to annihilate Xiang Jie [项籍] and secure imperial dominion.
Thus, a sovereign who deeply comprehends the *Upper Stratagem* [上略] can appoint worthy ministers and capture enemies;
who deeply comprehends the *Middle Stratagem* [中略] can command generals and organize troops;
who deeply comprehends the *Lower Stratagem* [下略] can discern the sources of prosperity and decline,
and carefully examine the principles of governing the realm.
A subject who deeply comprehends the *Three Stratagems* can preserve merit and safeguard his life.

*The Nine Variations* [九奇]—
The Yellow Emperor established the *Nine Variations* based on the *well-field system* [井田] to regulate the military,
dividing the land into nine squares.
Five were used for battle formations,
four for concealed positions,
leaving the center empty,
where the supreme commander resided.
Zhuge Liang [诸葛孔明] expanded upon this method:
formations within formations,
units within units—
advancing, the rear becomes the front,
retreating, the front becomes the rear—
no hasty flight when advancing,
no sudden retreat when withdrawing,
strike the head and the tail responds,
strike the tail and the head responds,
strike the center and both ends respond—
this is the *Changshan Snake Array* [常山蛇势] of Huan Wen [桓温].

Generally, military arts favor ingenious changes.
From the first to the ninth,
like an endless cycle,
unable to exhaust.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this."

The world abounds with taboos and prohibitions,
yet the people grow ever more impoverished.
*Extended Meaning*: As with the Qin laws—if one spoke in couplets, he was executed in the marketplace.
*Quoted from* *The Mirror of History* [通鉴]: In the thirty-fourth year of the First Emperor’s reign [始皇三十四年], Chancellor Li Si [丞相李斯] submitted a memorial stating:
*"I request that all historical records not of the Qin be burned.
Those not pertaining to the Imperial Scholars [博士]’s duties,
any who possess hidden poems, books, or the sayings of a hundred schools [藏诗、书、百家语],
must all deliver them to the local magistrates [守尉] for destruction.
Those who dare to recite poems or books in couplets [偶语者] shall be executed in the marketplace.
Those who criticize the present by citing the past [以古非今者] shall be exterminated."*

*Extended Meaning*: As with the Tang Empress Wu’s [武后] opening of the door to denunciations,
people walked with heavy steps and held their breath,
daring not to speak with one another,
using only glances along the roads.
*Quoted*: In the first month of the first year of the Light Residence era [光宅元年], the Empress set up bronze boxes [铜匦] to receive secret denunciations.
She cast a bronze box, its shape like a chamber with four corners,
able to admit but not expel.
Since the rebellion of Xu Jingye [徐敬业], she feared the world plotted against her.
Moreover, having long monopolized state affairs [久专国事],
with internal conduct unrighteous [内行不正],
she knew the princes and ministers harbored resentment and disobedience,
and sought to intimidate them with mass slaughter.
Thus, she widely encouraged denunciations.
Those who denounced received provisions for horses and food,
and were sent to the imperial residence [行在所].
Even farmers and woodcutters could be summoned,
some promoted without due rank [不次除官],
and none were punished if their accusations proved false.
Thereupon, denunciations swarmed from all quarters.
The people multiplied their ingenious tools [利器], yet the state grew ever more corrupt.
The people multiplied their cunning arts [技巧], yet strange and licentious things arose.
Laws and decrees multiplied, yet thieves and bandits grew numerous.
*Extended Meaning*: Then there must be scheming minds.
*Quoted from* *Zhuangzi* [庄子]—*The Earth and Heaven* [天地篇] passage:
Child Gong [子贡] journeyed south to Chu [於楚],
passing through Han Yin [过汉阴],
where he saw a man of a hundred cubits [一丈人]
busily preparing his garden plots [为圃畦],
dug channels [凿隧] to lead water into the well [入井],
carried a jar [抱瓮] to draw water out [出灌],
laboring strenuously yet seeing little effect.
Child Gong said:
*"There is a device here—
in one day, it can irrigate a hundred plots [浸百畦],
requiring little effort yet achieving much.
Would you not desire it, Master?"*
The gardener looked up and replied:
*"How so?"*
*"Carve wood into a lever [凿木为机],
heavy at the rear, light at the front,
drawing water like pulling a cord.
Repeated as needed, its name is* *the well sweep* [槔].
The gardener angrily flushed and laughed:
*"I heard from my teacher—
he who uses devices must engage in scheming deeds,
and he who engages in scheming deeds must harbor scheming minds.
Scheming minds dwell in the chest,
leaving no room for pure whiteness.
When pure whiteness is incomplete,
the spirit’s birth is unstable.
An unstable spirit—
the Dao does not bear it.
I am not ignorant, but I am ashamed and do not act."*

*Extended Meaning*: Refers to carving and ornamenting.
*Quoted from* *Zhuangzi* [庄子]—*The Way of Heaven* [天道篇] passage:
*"It covers and sustains Heaven and Earth,
carves and molds all forms,
yet does not contrive cleverness—
this is called* *Heaven’s Joy* [天乐]."

*Extended Meaning*: As with King Zhou’s [纣王] creation of strange and licentious arts to please women.
*Quoted from* *The Book of Documents* [尚书]—*The Great Declaration, Lower Part* [泰誓下]:
*"King Wu [武王] said:
Now, the Shang king Jie [商王受],
wields tyranny and inflicts slaughter,
poisoning and tormenting all under Heaven.
He exalts and trusts deceitful flatterers,
casts aside loyal ministers and advisors,
abandons the established codes and punishments,
imprisons slaves and upright scholars,
neglects the ancestral altars and sacrificial rites,
fails to maintain the rituals of the land and grain.
Instead, he crafts strange and licentious arts to please women.
The Celestial Lord does not comply with him,
and the diviner declares his fate shall perish with the times.
You shall diligently serve me,
executing the Heavenly punishment upon him."*

The **Dao/Way** section’s text states:

*"The scope of its meaning is: Even the petty theft of hooks may escalate to the grand scale of usurping a state—such as Tian Chengzi [田成子], who in a single day assassinated the Qi king [齐君] and stole his realm. What he stole was not merely the kingdom—he also took its sacred laws and virtuous governance. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of a thief, yet enjoyed the security of Yao [尧] and Shun [舜]. Small states dared not oppose him, and great states dared not punish him; twelve generations held Qi’s sovereignty. The scope of its meaning is: Li Si [李斯] advised Er Shi [二世] to employ the **supervision and punishment** technique to suppress theft. Quoted from *The Comprehensive Mirror* [通鉴]: In the second winter of Er Shi’s reign in the Qin [秦], the Second Emperor frequently rebuked Li Si, who held the Three Ducal positions [三公]. How could it be that theft persisted under such authority? Li Si, fearful and trembling, enriched his titles and ranks, unsure of his fate, and thus curried Er Shi’s favor, replying in writing: The sage ruler must be capable of employing the **supervision and punishment** technique. Hence, Shen Zi [申子] said: ‘He who holds the world yet does not indulge in wantonness, but instead treats the world as a shackle upon himself—there is no other reason than his inability to supervise and punish, while instead burdening himself with the labor of the people, like Yao and Yu [尧、禹]. Thus, he is called a shackle.’ If one cannot practice the clear techniques of Shen and Han [申、韩], nor follow the **Dao/Way of supervision and punishment**, but instead merely seeks to gratify himself with the world’s ease, while exhausting his own form and spirit to serve the people, then he is but a drudge for the common folk—not one who nurtures the world. What is there to honor in this? Therefore, the enlightened ruler employs the **supervision and punishment** technique to make absolute judgments from above, so that authority rests not in his ministers. Then he can extinguish the paths of benevolence and righteousness, sever the eloquence of persuasive speech, and halt the clamor of carts and horses. The Leftist School [左氏] was particularly adept at this. Yet, though his heart yearned for wantonness, none dared resist him. Thus, the ministers and people could not even offer timely warnings of errors—who would dare to plot change? Er Shi was pleased, and so the **supervision and punishment** grew ever stricter: those who taxed the people heavily were hailed as sagacious historians; those who killed many were called loyal ministers. Half of the travelers on the roads were under sentence, and corpses piled daily in the markets; the Qin people grew ever more terrified and prone to rebellion. The scope of its meaning is: Han Wudi [汉武帝] entrusted Zhang Tang [张汤] and Zhao Yu [赵禹] to codify the laws. Quoted from *The Comprehensive Mirror* [通鉴]: In the fifth year of the *Jian Yuan* era [建元], the Emperor commissioned the Grand Master of Justice Zhang Tang and the Middle Master of Justice Zhao Yu to jointly revise the legal codes. The decree emphasized harsh interpretations and binding officials to their duties. Zhang Tang’s biography was recorded, and his method of ‘**foresightful legal scholars**’ [见知法史] was adopted, with officials mutually overseeing each other’s application of the law, growing ever stricter from this point onward. Zhao Yu’s biography was also recorded. Hence, the sages proclaimed: ‘I take no action, yet the people transform themselves. I involve myself in no affairs, yet the people grow rich. I love tranquility, yet the people align themselves. I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.’ The scope of its meaning is: Like Yao and Shun, who were silent and still in their governance, reclining in their halls while the people flourished. Quoted from the words of *Yangzi* [杨子] in *The Inquiry into the Dao/Way* [问道篇]: ‘In ancient times, Yu and Xia [虞、夏] inherited Yao’s title and followed Yao’s Dao/Way. The laws were clear, and the rites and music were established. They ruled with ease, their hands folded in their sleeves, and the people flourished. *Fu* [阜] means *rich* [富]. They reclined with folded sleeves upon the rocky veranda, observing the people’s natural prosperity.’ The scope of its meaning is: ‘**Wen** [文] and **Wu** [武] neither knew nor recognized [不识不知], yet they conformed to the Heavenly Emperor’s will. With folded sleeves and hands at rest, the world was governed.’ Quoted from the words in *The Mao Commentary* [毛诗] on *The Great Odes* [大雅], *The Sovereign’s Majesty* [皇矣篇]: ‘The Emperor spoke to King Wen: “I cherish the virtue/power of the people, neither raising my voice nor showing favor, neither prolonging summers nor shortening winters, not knowing nor recognizing—yet I follow the Heavenly Emperor’s will.”’ The scope of its meaning is: ‘Like Cao Can [曹参], who served as Han’s chancellor, where Hui Di [惠帝] criticized him for not attending to affairs. The account in the *Book of Han* [汉书] has already been cited—no need to repeat it here.’ His governance is described in *The Fifth and Eighty Chapter of the Bright and Virtuous* [闷闷章第五十八]."

Misfortune, oh misfortune, is the reverse of fortune,
Fortune, oh fortune, harbors misfortune within.
*Extended meaning:* Fortune concealed within misfortune—
as in *Liezi*’s account of a Song man who practiced benevolence and righteousness.
*Quoted from* *Liezi* [列子] *□* *Sayings of the Symbol* [说符篇], *already cited in meaning—no need to repeat.*

*Extended meaning:* Misfortune hidden within fortune—
as in *Liezi*’s account of the wealthy man of Yu’s ancestral hall.
*Quoted from* *Liezi* [列子] *□* *Sayings of the Symbol* [说符篇], *already cited in meaning—no need to repeat.*

Thus, the Sage is square yet does not cut,
Sharp yet does not pierce,
Upright yet does not overreach,
Luminous yet does not dazzle.
*Extended meaning:* The *Classic* says: "Upright and gentle."
*Quoted from* *The Book of Documents* [尚书] *□* *The Admonitions of Gao Yao* [皋陶谟].
Gao Yao spoke: "Du, also, in conduct has nine virtues.
It is said that if a man has virtue, then his words are adopted.
Yu asked: 'How?'
Gao Yao replied: 'Wide yet cautious, wide and gentle yet dignified and cautious.
Gentle yet steadfast, gentle and obedient yet firmly rooted.
Reverent yet respectful, earnestly reverent and meticulous.
In chaos yet respectful—chaos is order.
Agitated yet resolute, trained in agitation yet firmly determined.
Upright yet gentle, direct yet warm and temperate.
Simple yet honorable, simple yet principled.
Strong yet solid, strong and robust yet sincere.
Powerful yet righteous—powerful in courage yet virtuous.
Manifest their constant virtue—manifest means evident.
Their virtue is evident in their person, and yet they remain constant from beginning to end—truly auspicious scholars.'
*Chapter on Governing Men and Serving Heaven* [治人事天] *Fifty-Ninth.*

Now, only frugality is called early preparation.
Early preparation is the accumulation of virtue.
Accumulate virtue greatly, and nothing shall you fail to overcome.
Fail to overcome nothing, and none shall know your limit.
Know no limit, and you may have a realm.
*Extended meaning:* Mencius said: "Cultivate the mind, nurture the nature—this is how one serves Heaven."
*Quoted from* *Mencius* [孟子] *□* *Exhausting the Heart* [尽心章句上].
*Note:* "Cultivate" means to hold fast without abandoning; "nurture" means to follow without harm; "serve" means to attend without transgression.

*Extended meaning:* The utmost virtue—fire cannot burn it, water cannot drown it.
*Quoted from* *Liezi* [列子] *□* *The Yellow Emperor* [黄帝篇].
All things are without love or fear—
entering water, not drowned;
entering fire, not burned;
hewn or beaten, no pain;
struck or battered, no injury;
walking on air as on solid ground,
sleeping on void as on a couch—
clouds and mists do not obstruct his sight,
thunder and lightning do not disturb his hearing,
praise and blame do not sway his heart,
mountains and valleys do not impede his step—
his movement is divine.

*Extended meaning:* Once, Geng Sangzi dwelt on the slopes of Yu Mountain.
*Quoted from* *Zhuangzi* [庄子] *□* *Geng Sang Chu* [庚桑楚].
Once, Geng Sangzi bore the surname Geng, given name Chu, a disciple of the Old Master.
He dwelt on the slopes of Yu Mountain.
The mountain is named in the land of Lu.

The meaning already cited is complete, and no repetition is made.

**Chapter Sixty: Governing the Great Realm**
To rule the world with the Dao,
its spirits shall lack divinity.

*Extended meaning:* When birds, beasts, fish, and turtles all thrive,
then the spirits and gods also find peace.

*Quoted from* *The Book of Documents* [《尚书》] *□* *The Instructions of Yi* [《伊训》], admonishing King Tai Jia, the heir to the throne:

*"Alas! In ancient Xia, the kings and ministers diligently cultivated their virtue,
and there were no celestial calamities.
Mountains, rivers, ghosts, and spirits—
none failed to find peace.
Even birds, beasts, fish, and turtles all flourished.
But their descendants did not follow,
nor did they adhere to the Way of the former kings.
The August Heaven sent disaster,
using me as its instrument.
It attacked from Mingtiao—
Mingtiao, where Xia dwelled.
Bo, where Tang resided.
I came from Bo.
This speaks of how Jie accumulated evil at Mingtiao,
while Tang’s virtue flourished only after he settled at Bo."*

*Extended meaning:* In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, during the 32nd year of Duke Zhuang of Lu,
a spirit descended at Cuì.

*Quoted from* *Spring and Autumn Annals* [《春秋》] *□* *Duke Zhuang of Lu, Year 32*—
already cited in full, no repetition made.

*Extended meaning:* In the 30th year of Duke Xiang,
the people of Zheng killed Boyou.

*Quoted from* *Spring and Autumn Annals* [《春秋》] *□* *Duke Xiang of Lu, Year 30*—
already cited in full, no repetition made.

*Extended meaning:* By the 7th year of Duke Zhao,
Zichan appointed Gongsun Xie and Liangzhi to pacify them.
Xie was the son of Zikong.
Liangzhi was the son of Boyou.
Two men were appointed as ministers
to ease the spirits of Zikong and Boyou.
Thus, it was settled.

Zidazu, named Youji, asked its meaning.
Zichan replied:
*"When ghosts have a place to rest,
they no longer become malevolent."*

When Zichan traveled to Jin,
Zhao Jingzi asked him:
*"Can Boyou still act as a ghost?"*
Zichan replied:
*"He can.
When life begins, it is called po [魄].
At first, it is transformation.
Once born, po becomes hun [魂] in the yang.
If one receives much vital essence from things,
then hun and po grow strong.
If one dwells in high office and enjoys abundant offerings,
then the body and po grow strong.
If one takes much vital essence from things,
then the hun-qi grows strong.
Thus, with vitality reaching divine clarity,
this is how one nourishes vitality to divinity,
and nourishes the spirit to illumination.
Vitality is the spirit before it manifests;
illumination is the spirit before it shines.
Even commoners, when they die,
their hun and po can still cling to people,
becoming licentious and malevolent.
How much more so for one of Liangzhi’s noble name—
our former lord, Duke Mu of Jin,
the grandson of Ziliang,
the son of Zier,
who held office for three generations!
If, across three generations,
they wielded political power,
and could act as ghosts—
is this not fitting?"*

*Extended meaning:* During the reign of Empress Wu of Tang,
Wu Sansi purchased two concubines.

*Quoted from* *The Zuo Tradition*—
already cited in full, no repetition made.

**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great Realm as the Lowlands**

**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great Realm as the Lowlands**

The great realm is the confluence of the world,
the meeting of all under heaven,
the receptive of all under heaven.
The receptive ever triumphs through stillness over the active,
and stillness is its natural state.

*Extended meaning:* As when the people carry their infants to come of their own accord.

Quoted from *The Analects*—**Zilu, Thirteenth Chapter**—
where Zilu asked to learn farming.
The Master said, *"I am not as skilled as the old farmers."*
He asked to learn gardening.
The Master said, *"I am not as skilled as the old gardeners."*
Zilu departed.
The Master said, *"A petty man, this Zilu!"*

When the ruler cherishes propriety, the people dare not fail to show respect.
When the ruler cherishes righteousness, the people dare not fail to submit.
When the ruler cherishes trustworthiness, the people dare not fail to act sincerely.
Thus, the people of all directions will come bearing their children upon their backs.
What need is there for farming?

Some take from below to gain,
others take by being below.

*Extended meaning:* Duke Xuan of Qi asked, *"Is there a Way to treat neighboring states?"*
Mencius replied, *"There is."*

Quoted from *Mencius*—**Discourses on King Hui of Liang, Lower**—
where Mencius said, *"Only the virtuous can serve the great with the small,
thus Tang served Ge.
From *Mencius*—**Discourses on Lord Wen of Teng, Lower**—
Mencius said: *"Tang resided in Bo, neighboring Ge.
The Lord of Ge was dissolute and did not perform sacrifices.
Tang sent someone to ask, 'Why do you not sacrifice?'
He replied, 'I have no offerings for the sacrificial beasts.'
Tang sent him cattle and sheep.
The Lord of Ge ate them but still did not sacrifice.
Tang sent someone again to ask, 'Why do you not sacrifice?'
He replied, 'I have no grain for the ritual vessels.'
Tang sent the people of Bo to till his fields, while the elderly and weak brought food.
The Lord of Ge led his people to seize those who had wine, food, or grain—
those who refused, he killed.
A boy offered him millet and meat, and he killed him and took it.
The *Book of Documents* says: 'The Lord of Ge was hostile to the offering.'
This is what is meant.
Hostile to the offering—he was an enemy to those who gave it.
King Wen served the Kunyi.
From *The Mao Commentary*—**Great Odes, Glosses**—
The rise of King Wen originated with the Great King.
It says:
*'He did not spurn the humble, nor did he reject the lowly.
The gnarled trees were uprooted, the path was made straight,
the Kunyi were subdued, their mouths were sealed.
Only the wise can serve the small with the great,
thus the Great King and King Zhou’s ancestor left Yin.
They served the Xirong.
The northern barbarians were strong—like the Xiongnu.
From *Mencius*—**Discourses on King Hui of Liang, Lower**—
Lord Wen of Teng asked: *"Teng is a small state.
If we exhaust our strength to serve a great state, we cannot escape harm.
What should we do?"*
Mencius replied: *"In ancient times, the Great King resided in Na.
The Di barbarians invaded.
He served them with furs and silk, but could not escape.
He served them with dogs and horses, but could not escape.
He served them with jade and pearls, but could not escape.
Then he gathered his elders and said: 'What the Di desire is our land.
I have heard: The virtuous do not harm others with what they nurture.
My lords, what fear is there of losing a ruler?
I will depart.'
He left Yin, crossed the Liang Mountains, and settled beneath the Qi Mountains.
The people of Yin said: 'A virtuous man—we must not lose him!'
They followed him like returning from market.
He also cited Goujian’s service to Wu.
Goujian was the name of the King of Yue.
The account appears in *The Spring and Autumn Annals* and *Records of the Grand Historian*.
Zigong advised King Gou of Yue, saying: 'If Your Majesty truly sends troops to aid him,
and uses precious treasures to please his heart,
and employs humble words to honor his rites,
this is what the sages call bending to achieve reach.'
The King of Yue sent his minister Wen Zhen to kneel before the King of Wu, saying:
'Yue offers all its warriors—three thousand men—to serve Wu.'
The King of Wu told Zigong: 'Does the King of Yue wish to come himself?'
Zigong said: 'To offer all our people, and then have their ruler come as well—
this is not proper.'
The King of Wu then accepted the King of Yue’s troops,
and thanked him for leaving Goujian behind.

The great realm seeks only to encompass others,
the small realm seeks only to serve others.
Both obtain what they desire,
thus the great realm should act as the lowly.

*Extended meaning:* The small realm presents tribute and taxes.

Quoted: *"To hold the tribute."* From *The Rites of Zhou*:
*"With birds, six offerings are made to rank the ministers.
The duke offers hides and silk, the minister offers a lamb,
the great officer offers a goose, the scholar offers a partridge,
the commoner offers a duck or its kind, and the artisans and merchants offer a chicken."*

*Extended meaning:* In the third year of Duke Wen of Lu,
the Duke went to Jin.
Quoted from *The Spring and Autumn Annals*:
*"In the third year of Duke Wen of Lu, the Duke went to Jin and made an alliance with the Duke of Jin.
The Duke of Jin feasted him and recited *The Thick and Thriving*—
'The thick and thriving is the *gai* plant,
as seen in the *Odes*—
Take it when it is visible,
the gentleman rejoices with propriety.'
Zhuangzi, descending with the Duke, bowed in thanks,
saying: 'The small state receives commands from the great state.
How dare we not be cautious in our rites?
The great state honors us with grand ceremony—
what greater joy is there?'
The Duke of Jin descended the steps to decline,
then ascended and completed the bowing.
Together, they returned to the upper steps for the completed bowing.
The Duke of Lu recited the *Joyous Odes*.
The *Joyous Odes*—from *The Great Odes*—
says: 'The bright and manifest virtue,
suitable for the people and the gentleman,
receives blessings from Heaven.'*

*Extended meaning:* In the first year of Duke Xiang,
Wei Zichu and Jin Zhizhi came as envoys—
according to ritual.
Quoted from *The Spring and Autumn Annals*:
*"In the first year of Duke Xiang, winter,
Wei Zichu and Jin Zhizhi came as envoys—ritual protocol.
Whenever a ruler ascended the throne,
small states paid homage to him—
this is serving the great with the small.
The great state sent envoys—
this is the great serving the small,
to renew friendship, establish trust,
plan affairs, and mend deficiencies.
These are the greatest of rites."*

The *Obstruction*—that is, the *Transgression*—
For the rites, what is greatest is to establish the state in peace and benefit the people.

**Extended Meaning:** *The Daoist Classic of Virtue and Power—Extended Meanings*—
*Handwritten Notes, Volume Sixteen complete.*
*Handwritten Notes, Volume Seventeen.*

**Five-Peak Qing’an Hermit Wang Shouzheng’s Collected Works**
*Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Essence of All Things*

The Dao is the essence of all things,
the treasure of the virtuous,
the safeguard of the unvirtuous.

**Extended Meaning:** All things derive their origin.

Quoted from *The Book of Changes—Symbolic Text of the Qian Hexagram*:
The *Symbol* says:
*"Great indeed is the Primordial Power of Qian!
All things derive their origin,
And it unifies Heaven.
Clouds move, rain descends—
All things take form in their kinds.
The Great Clarity completes the cycle,
Six positions established in due time—
At the appointed hour, it rides the Six Dragons to govern Heaven.
The Dao of Qian transforms and changes,
Each rectifying its nature and vital essence."*

The *Simian*—that is, the elucidation defining the meaning of a hexagram—
is so named because it *interprets* it.

It summarizes the *Qian* and the *Yuan*.
*Qian* is the name of the hexagram,
*Yuan* is the first virtue of *Qian*’s power,
hence it is paired with *Qian* to elucidate it.

*"Great indeed is the Primordial Power of Qian!"*
The *qi* of *Qian* is vast and expansive,
its essence broad and far-reaching—
and since it is the great origin from which all things arise,
it is said: *"Great indeed is the Primordial Power of Qian,
all things derive their origin."*

Thus, though one may establish a Son of Heaven
and appoint the Three Ministers,
even with a jade tablet and four horses as tribute,
it is not as valuable as advancing this Dao.

**Extended Meaning:** *Establishing the Son of Heaven, appointing the Three Ministers.*

Quoted:
*"Within the Four Seas’ vastness,
amidst the myriad things’ abundance,
when first mankind was born,
there could be no ruler—
thus the sovereign was established to shepherd them.
The Son of Heaven—
revering the Supreme Deity,
treating Heaven as father,
Earth as mother—
is called the Son of Heaven.
One person cannot govern broadly—
thus officials are appointed to oversee them,
and so the Son of Heaven has the Three Ministers."*

From *The Book of Documents [□ Zhou Officials]*:
*"It is the Three Ministers who
discuss the Dao and govern the state.
The Grand Teacher—
whose wisdom is a boundless wellspring,
whose conduct is a model for emulation—
when consulted, responds;
when sought, is found.
This is called the Grand Teacher.
Also called Shangfu.
*Tai* means great.
As the king’s teacher, he rides in a ceremonial carriage
with green canopy,
wearing a gold seal and purple sash."*

The Grand Tutor—*xun*, to instruct; *bao*, to safeguard.
From *The Great Dai Li*:
*"He transmits the Son of Heaven’s virtue and righteousness.
If the Son of Heaven shows no filial piety to his parents,
no kindness to the common people,
lacks propriety toward great ministers,
or fails in judicial impartiality—
these are the Grand Tutor’s derelictions of duty."*

The Grand Guardian—*bao*, to lean upon; *ren*, to bear responsibility.
From *The Great Dai Li*:
*"If the Son of Heaven sits improperly in his position,
receives scriptures without reverence,
speaks without proper tone,
sings without harmonic accord,
advances or retreats without rising or lowering his seat,
or neglects the rites of bowing and greeting—
these are the Grand Guardian’s derelictions of duty."*

**Extended Meaning:** When two rulers meet,
there are always the rites of tribute offerings.

Quoted from *The Rites of Zhou*.

The **Grand Tutor**—*fù*, to instruct; *rén*, to bear responsibility.
Using the six beasts as tribute offerings,
to establish the rites for two rulers meeting,
already detailed in the **Sixty-First Chapter**,
now not repeated.

**Extended Meaning:** As in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Duke Xi of Zhou**, Year 33,
when the Qin army reached **Hua**,
**Zheng’s merchant Xian Gao** encountered them.
With a carriage covered in **raw oxhide** (韦, *wéi*—leather, *shú gē*—unprocessed hide),
he offered twelve **first-calved oxen** (先牛, *xiān niú*—prime oxen),
four **prime oxen** (先, *xiān*—prime; 韦牛, *wéi niú*—leather-oxen),
for the ancient custom of presenting gifts to others
always required something to precede the offering.
He said to the Qin army: *"My humble lord hears that Your Excellency is about to lead your troops against my city,
so I dare to offer provisions to your followers.
I do not presume to be lavish (不腆, *bù tiǎn*—not excessive),
but merely to provide what is sufficient.
My city’s contributions are but a day’s accumulation for those who stay,
and a night’s provisions for those who march.
Moreover, I have sent urgent messengers to Zheng,
so that they may prepare accordingly."*

**Extended Meaning:** Mencius said: *"No one from Qi dares to speak to the king with words of virtue and righteousness."*
Quoted from *Mencius*, **Chapter on Gong Sun Chou** (下, *xià*—lower part):
*"Mencius replied to Gong Sun Chou’s words: 'Your Reverence has shown me respect as a child,
but I have yet to see how Your Reverence respects the king.'
Chou said: 'Alas, what strange words are these?
Do the people of Qi not speak of virtue and righteousness to the king?
Is it that they regard virtue and righteousness as unattractive?
Their true thought is: *Why would such a one be worthy of speaking of virtue and righteousness?*
Then there is nothing greater than this in failing to show respect.
I do not dare to present the Dao of Yao and Shun before the king,
for it is not mine to offer.
Thus, the people of Qi do not respect me as I respect the king.
Why was this Dao held in such esteem in antiquity?
Was it not because it could be sought and obtained,
and with it, crimes could be pardoned?
Hence, it is most precious for all under Heaven.'*

**Extended Meaning:** As in *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Duke Xi of Zhou**, Year 33,
*"Summer, the 4th month, on the day *xīnwù* (辛巳),
the Qin army was defeated at **Jiao**,
capturing **Bai Li Mengming**, **Xi Qi Shu**, and **Bai Yi Bing**,
and returning them to their lord.
The Qin lord, in **plain mourning attire** (素服, *sù fú*—undyed garments),
stood outside the capital, facing his army and weeping:
*'Alone, I have disobeyed the admonitions of **Jian Shou**,
bringing shame upon my ministers—this is my fault.
I do not blame **Mengming**,
for this was my error.
What crime did the great officers commit?
Moreover, I did not cover their great virtue
with a single minor offense.
This is the meaning of:
*"Prevent difficulties before they arise,
and magnify greatness before it grows small."*
Quoted from *The Book of Changes*, **Chapter on Non-Action** (为无为, *wéi wúwéi*—"As Non-Action"),
the **Sixty-Third Paragraph**:
*'Difficulties should be addressed when they are still easy,
and greatness should be cultivated when it is still small.'*

**Extended Meaning:** *The Book of Documents* says:
*"Resentment lies not in what is clear,
but in what is unseen—this is the danger."*
Quoted from *The Five Children’s Song* (五子之歌, *Wǔ Zǐ zhī Gē*) in *The Book of Documents*:
*"Even the most foolish among the people—
one who can defeat me—
if they lose three times,
resentment does not lie in what is clear,
but in what is unseen—this is the danger.
I stand before the myriad people,
as solemn as driving six horses with a rotting whip.
How can those above not show reverence?
*'I'* refers to the five children’s self-address.
A ruler who loses the people’s hearts
becomes a solitary tyrant,
and even the most foolish among them
can defeat me.
Three losses—
this means losing many.
Resentment and estrangement of the people—
does it only become known
when it is already manifest?
One must address it
before it even arises.
Light promises bring little trust,
many minor changes lead to great difficulties.
Thus, the sage finds difficulty in this,
and so ultimately faces none."*

**Extended Meaning:** **Jin Jie Yang** had no **double commands**,
and **Lu Zhong You** had no **premature pledges**—
these are praised in both ancient and modern times.
Quoted:
*"**Jin Jie Yang** had no double commands"—
in *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Duke Xuān of Lu**, Year 15,
spring, *"Gong Sun Guifu met the Chu lord at Song.
The people of Song sent **Le Ying** to plead for help in Jin.
The Jin lord wished to assist them."*

Lord Bo Zong said: *"No, it cannot be done."* And so the matter was halted.

He was sent to Song by Jin, with the instruction not to surrender to Chu.
When he arrived, the people of Song said: *"The Jin army is fully mobilized and will soon arrive."*
The people of Zheng took this and presented it to Chu.
The Chu lord lavished him with heavy bribes,
urging him to reverse his words—
but he refused.
After three such entreaties,
the Chu lord had him placed upon a battle chariot
and commanded to call out to the people of Song,
declaring his intent to carry out the order of his lord.
Thus, he fulfilled his sovereign’s command.

The Chu lord prepared to execute him,
but allowed him to speak first:
*"You have already granted me leave not to submit,
yet now you demand I do so—why?"*
*"It is not that I lack trust,
but you have abandoned me—
hasten now to your punishment!"*

He replied:
*"I have heard this saying:
When a sovereign can restrain his commands, that is **virtue**;
when a subject can uphold his sovereign’s commands, that is **trust**.
To act with **trust** while guided by **virtue** is **benefit**.
If my counsel does not fail to bring **benefit**,
and I thereby safeguard the state,
I am the people’s guardian.
**Virtue** cannot tolerate **double trust**,
**trust** cannot tolerate **double commands**.
Your sovereign has entrusted me with a command,
yet you do not know it—
how can I betray it?
I received the command and set out,
knowing that death would be my fate if I failed.
If I betray it now,
how can I still be trusted?
My pledge to your sovereign
was to fulfill his command.
To fulfill his command,
even unto death,
is my reward.
My lord has a subject of **trust**,
and I have not failed in my command.
The Chu lord has already been fully persuaded—
my mission is complete.
Death?
What more could I seek?"*

The Chu lord then released him and let him return.

**Lu Zhong You** had no **premature pledges**—
this is found in *The Analects* (Book of Yan Yuan, Twelfth):
*"Host"* (here meaning *to leave a lingering matter*),
just as in *host resentment* (lingering grudge).
He was swift to act on his words,
leaving no room for doubt in his pledge.
This shows why **Zi You** (Lu Zhong You’s courtesy name)
earned such **trust** from the people.
It was due to his long-standing cultivation of **virtue**,
and so both ancient and modern times praise him.

**Extended Meaning** states:
*"In the past, when Qi attacked Lu,
they demanded the **Zhen Ding** (岑鼎).
The Lu sovereign falsely offered another vessel
and then requested a covenant.
The Qi sovereign did not trust him.
Within the **virtue** of the covenant,
the pledge was already complete—
there was no need for further confirmation."*

Quoted from *Liu Zi* (Book of **Stepping on Trust**, □):
*"In the past, when Qi attacked Lu,
they demanded the **Zhen Ding** (岑鼎).
The Lu sovereign falsely offered another vessel
and then requested a covenant.
The Qi sovereign did not trust him.
Within the **virtue** of the covenant,
the pledge was already complete—
there was no need for further confirmation."*

**Extended Meaning** states:
From the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Lǐ of the 22nd year—when the people of Zhū [a minor state] marched out due to the *Mò Qǔ* affair—**the meaning was already complete**; no further recording was needed.
**Annotation:** Though Zhū was a separate state, weakened and unable to communicate on its own, it was a private vassal of Lu, like Zhēn yú under Lu—called *"ministers of the ancestral temple and grainary."* [i.e., loyal retainers.]

**On Ease and Difficulty:**
*"The easy to hold is easy to lose,
The unseen is easy to plot against,
The brittle is easy to shatter,
The faint is easy to disperse.
Act before it exists,
Order before it is disordered."*

**Extended Meaning** states:
In the past, Duke Jǐng of Qi fell ill and sought a physician from Qin.
**Quoted from** *The Zuo Tradition*—the meaning is already complete; no further recording was needed.

*"A tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout.
A nine-tiered terrace rises from a single clod of earth.
A thousand-li journey begins beneath one’s feet."*

**Extended Meaning** states:
*"A nine-tiered high terrace begins with a single basket of soil."*
**Quoted from** *The Analects* [□, Book of *Zǐ Hǎn* 9]:
The Master said:
*"To build a mountain, if it lacks but one basket of earth when nearly complete—stopping is my own doing.
To level ground, though it requires but one basket’s removal—advancing is my own doing."*
**Annotation:** *"Basket"* refers to a soil basket.
*The Book of Documents* says:
*"To build a mountain nine *rèn* high, its labor fails at the last basket."*
The Master’s words derive from this:
*"If the mountain is nearly complete but lacks one basket, its stopping is my own doing.
If the ground is leveled but requires one basket’s removal, its completion is my own doing."*
Truly, the scholar who does not persist in self-strengthening accumulates little from much,
But if he halts midway, all prior effort is wasted.
Whether he stops or proceeds—it lies within himself, not others.

*"The people’s undertakings often fail at the final stage.
If one treats the end as carefully as the beginning, there will be no failed matters."*

Thus, the Sage desires not what he desires not,
Does not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures.
He learns what others have already failed to learn,
Aiding the natural course of all things without forcing it.

**Extended Meaning** states:
*The Book of Documents* says:
*"To build a mountain nine *rèn* high, its labor fails at the last basket."*
**Quoted from** *The Shangshu* [□, *Lǚ Dà*]:
The Western Travelers presented a *dà*—Chu Gōng deemed it improper and composed a document to admonish King Wǔ:
*"Alas! Night and day, I never cease striving—
Not boasting of minor deeds, but cherishing the completion of great virtue.
To build a mountain nine *rèn* high, its labor fails at the last basket."*

**Extended Meaning** states:
*"None fail to begin, few complete the end."*
This is how the *Poet* criticized King Lǐ of Zhōu.
**Quoted from** *The Mao Poems* [*Dà Yá* □, *Dàng*]:
*"Dàng summoned Duke Mù of Zhōu—
Lamenting the great ruin of the Zhōu court.
King Lǐ was unprincipled; the realm was in chaos,
Lacking laws and propriety, hence this poem was made."*

*"Chaotic, the Heavenly Mandate,
The people’s sovereign is perverse."*
*"Chaotic"*—the appearance of ruined laws.
*"Heavenly Mandate"*—entrusted to the sovereign.
*"Perverse"*—the sovereign himself.
This speaks of King Lǐ ruling above the people as their sovereign,
Yet his governance was so extreme that he fell ill from heavy taxation and harsh punishments,
His decrees and commands grew increasingly twisted, deviating from ancient norms.

*"Heaven nurtures the common folk,
Yet his commands were not sincere."*
*"Common folk"*—the masses.
*"Sincere"*—truthful.
This means Heaven nurtures the people, and their commands should be taught with sincerity and loyalty.
But now it is not so—initially, the people nearly followed the good path,
Yet later they were corrupted by evil customs.
Thus, *"none fail to begin, few complete the end."*

Now, **Extended Meaning** takes this to illustrate:
*"If one treats the end as carefully as the beginning, there will be no failed matters."*

**Extended Meaning** states:
Wei Zēng of the Tang dynasty submitted a memorial to Emperor Taizong, stating:
*"Your Majesty’s ambitions, compared to the early Ac Zhenguan era, have gradually failed to persist in ten such respects."*

**Quoted:**
In the 13th year of Zhenguan (Tang), Wei Yīzhēng feared Emperor Taizong could not persist in frugality, as of late he had grown fond of extravagance, and thus memorialized:
*"In recent years, Your Majesty has gradually strayed from your former resolve.
The principles of simplicity and modesty have not been fully sustained.
I humbly list what I have heard, as follows:

In the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty practiced non-action and non-desire,
His pure and simple governance extended far and wide.
Examining the present, this virtue has gradually declined.
How do I know this?
Han Wén and Jìn Wǔ—though not supreme sages—
Han Wén sought a thousand-*lǐ* horse, Jìn Wǔ burned the *zhùtóu* [exotic] furs.
Now, Your Majesty seeks swift horses from afar,
Buys rare treasures from foreign lands,
Accepts abandoned gifts from travelers,
And is held in contempt by barbarians.
This is the first failure to persist.

In the past, Zǐ Gōng asked Confucius how to govern people.
Confucius said:
*'Awe-inspiring, as if driving six horses with a rotting whip.'*
Zǐ Gōng said:
*'How fearful!'*
Confucius replied:
*'If one does not govern with the Dao, then I am the one who fails.'*
Thus, *The Book of Documents* says:
*'People are the foundation of the state; if the foundation is firm, the state is secure.'*
As one who rules above others, how can one not be reverent?

In the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty treated the people as if they were wounded,
Loving them as his own children.
But in recent years, Your Majesty’s heart has turned to extravagance,
Forgotten simplicity and humility.
You say:
*'If the people are at ease, they become arrogant and idle;
If they are labored, they are easier to command.'*
From ancient times, there have been cases where the people’s ease led to the state’s ruin.
This is not the highest saying for the state’s prosperity,
Nor is it a long-term strategy for the people’s peace.
This is the second failure to persist.

In the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty reduced his own burdens to benefit the people.
Now, Your Majesty indulges his desires while exhausting the people.
The traces of humility and frugality change yearly,
The emotions of arrogance and excess grow daily.
You say:
*'If I do not do this, it will not benefit my own body.'*
The sentiments of a subject are beyond reproach—
This is merely a way to silence advisors,
How can it be said that one chooses the good and acts upon it?"*

This is the third failure to persist.

In the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty honed your reputation and integrity, took nothing for yourself, and associated only with the virtuous. You cherished the upright and distanced the petty.

Now it is not so. You treat the petty lightly, familiarizing yourself with them and drawing near. To be intimate with the petty is not the Dao of governance. To distance the upright is not the virtue of a flourishing state. This is the fourth failure to persist.

In the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty modeled yourself after the sage-kings of Tang and Yu, reducing gold and returning to simplicity. In recent years, however, you have taken delight in rare and difficult-to-obtain treasures, sparing no effort to acquire them—no matter how distant. Your fondness for luxuries has grown, yet the pursuit of substance remains unattainable. This is the fifth failure to persist.

In the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty sought the worthy as if parched. Those recommended by the virtuous were trusted and entrusted. In recent years, however, you favor and detest those whom the virtuous condemn, and those you recommend are not necessarily trustworthy. A lifetime of conduct does not vanish in an instant. Moreover, the upright cultivate benevolence and magnanimity, while the petty thrive on slander and calumny for their own gain. If Your Majesty does not discern their roots but lightly judges them, you drive the steadfast from the path while advancing the scheming, causing men to seek only to evade blame and exert no true effort. This is the sixth failure to persist.

When Your Majesty first ascended the throne, you abolished the hunting grounds within and cut off the sources of the chase without. Yet after several years, you could not sustain your resolve. Though you did not indulge in prolonged hunts, you sometimes exceeded the proper rites of the three drives, making the pleasures of the chase visible to the people and the tribute of falcons and hounds reaching even to the distant barbarians. You depart at dawn and return only at night, finding joy in galloping, heedless of unforeseen calamities. Once such recklessness takes hold, how can it be rectified? This is the seventh failure to persist.

Confucius said: *"A ruler governs his ministers with propriety, and a minister serves his ruler with loyalty."* When Your Majesty first took the throne, you received your subjects with reverence, and the benevolence of the ruler flowed downward while the loyalty of the ministers ascended. In recent years, however, you have neglected much. When they wish to speak, your demeanor is not welcoming; when they wish to petition, your grace is not extended. You often seize upon their faults and interrogate them over trivial errors. Even with the most eloquent arguments, none can fully express their loyalty. How then can you expect harmony between ruler and subjects, or mutual trust between sovereign and minister? This is the eighth failure to persist.

Arrogance must not be indulged, desires must not be gratified, pleasures must not be carried to excess, and ambition must not be sated. In the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty diligently governed, bending yourself to serve others. Yet in recent years, you have subtly grown proud, relying on the grandeur of your achievements, and scorned the wisdom of past sages. You look down upon the present age—this is the growth of arrogance. Though you may suppress your inclinations and follow counsel, you cannot forget it—this is the gratification of desire. Your mind is set on amusement, your heart knows no satiety. Though you have not entirely abandoned governance, you no longer devote yourself wholly to the Dao—this is pleasure nearing its peak. The land is at peace, the barbarians submit, yet you still exhaust the soldiers and horses, punishing distant tribes—this is ambition nearing fulfillment. This is the ninth failure to persist.

In the time of Yao and Tang, or Shun and Wu, there were no absent disasters. Yet they were called sages because they had both beginning and end, doing nothing and desiring nothing. In recent years, however, the people have been weary from labor, and those of the Central Plains are especially exhausted. The artisans of the capital are all detained daily for forced labor. The soldiers of the regular armies are frequently sent on separate expeditions. The markets of the villages are never empty of conscripts, and the roads are filled with relays of forced laborers.

The harm once taken root, it is easy to be startled and disturbed. Should drought or flood strike, and the grain and wheat fail to harvest, the people’s hearts may not remain as settled as before. This is the tenth failure to persist.

**On External Treasures:**
The common world values gold, jade, pearls, and jewels. The *Qianziwen* commentary states: *"Gold is born in Lishui."* Lishui is in Yongchang Commandery of Yizhou, where gold often floats to the surface—all of it superior quality. Jade comes from the southern Kun Mountain. In the valleys of Kun Mountain in Chu and Jing, fine jade is found. Pearls, sometimes called *nightlight*, may reach an inch in diameter, their glow illuminating twelve chariots. *Bao* refers to rare and precious plants, minerals, feathers, and furs—whatever the world holds dear. Yet these external treasures, sought beyond measure, exhaust life and harm nature. Unlike the Daoist ruler, who treasures virtue, or the cultivator, who values the Way alone, they do not covet what lies beyond. Thus, they preserve their natural state, unburdened by rare and costly goods.

**Chapter 65: The Difficulty of Governing the People**
The people are hard to govern because their cleverness is excessive. Therefore, ruling by cleverness is ruinous to the state, while not ruling by cleverness brings fortune.

**Elaboration:**
Zhuangzi said: *"If the ruler sincerely loves cleverness but lacks the Way, the world will fall into great disorder."* The *Zhuangzi* ["Bùkē Qìe" (器蠹)] states:
*"If the ruler sincerely loves cleverness but lacks the Way, the world will fall into great disorder. How do we know this? When the cleverness of crossbows, snares, and mechanical traps increases, birds are thrown into confusion above. The net is small and fine, resembling the star *Bi*, hence its name. Shooting with a bowstring is called *yi*. The crossbow’s trigger is called *ji*. When the cleverness of hooks, bait, and nets increases, fish are thrown into confusion in the water. *Gǔ* and *zhuì* are both nets; *sǔn* is also a trap. Hooks are fishing hooks; bait is fish bait. When the cleverness of *xuēgé*—the frames for spreading nets—and *luòluò*, *jiéfú* increases, beasts are thrown into confusion in the marshes. The *Erya* says: Nets for birds are called *luò*; nets for hares are called *jié* or *fú*—all are hare nets. Cleverness in deceit, gradual poisoning, and sophistry—such as *jiéhuá* (pretense of knowledge), *jiānbái* (rigid argument), and convoluted speech—when excessive, confuses the people with debate. The *Xihua* Master’s commentary states: *"Cleverness in calculation, deceit, and gradual corruption harms things. Jiéhuá is probing; jiānbái is rigid argument; sophistry and pretense are deceitful."* The cleverness of rigid argument and the sophistry of *jiān* (contradiction) and *bái* (dogmatic assertion), along with the deceit of *jié* (pretense) and *tóngyì* (false agreement), all deviate from true principle. Thus, the world often falls into great disorder, the fault lying in the love of cleverness. For true sages, wisdom is a sharp tool for the state.

**Elaboration:**
Take Emperor Ming of Han, whose narrow and scrutinizing nature—
*The Han Shu* records this in detail; no need for repetition.

**Chapter 66: The River and Sea as Kings of All Valleys**
The river and sea reign over all valleys because they excel in humility, thus becoming kings of all valleys.

**Elaboration:**
The *Yijing* says: *"The Earth’s Way transforms fullness into flowing humility."* The *Yi* ["Qian" (谦) Hexagram] states:
*"Qian (Humility) is auspicious. The Heavenly Way descends to aid and shines brightly. The Earthly Way is low yet ascends. The Heavenly Way diminishes fullness and increases humility. The Earthly Way transforms fullness into flowing humility. Ghosts and spirits harm fullness but bless humility. Human nature abhors fullness and loves humility. Humility is exalted yet uncrossable; the virtuous person’s end is thus. Therefore, the sage, wishing to surpass others, speaks humbly. Wishing to lead others, places himself last. Thus, though in high position, he is not burdensome; though in front, he does no harm. Therefore, the world gladly follows without tiring."*

**Elaboration:**
Yet the sage knows that fullness invites loss.
*The Shangshu* ["Dà Yǔ Mó" (大禹谟)] states:
*"Thirty days, the people rebelled against the command. Yi Zhan advised Yu: 'Only virtue moves Heaven, reaching even the distant. Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain. This is the Way of Heaven.'"*
It further cites *"restraining oneself in humility and retreat"*—the fourth line of *Qian* is without misfortune, for those who do not violate principle move in accord with reason, thus facing no adversity.

**Elaboration:**
As in *Zhuangzi*, where Duke Ai of Lu asked Zhongni:
*The Zhuangzi* ["Dé Chōng Fú" (德充符)] states:

The meaning is already complete, so it shall not be repeated again.
Because he does not contend, therefore none under Heaven can contend with him.

**Elaboration:**
*The Classic of Documents* states:
*"You alone do not boast, and none under Heaven will contend with you in ability.
You alone do not vaunt, and none under Heaven will contend with you in merit."*

Quoting from *The Classic of Documents* ["Dà Yǔ Mó" (大禹谟)]:
The Emperor said, *"O, Shun, the Emperor!
Come, O Yu.
The floodwaters are vast and turbulent.
Heed my warning, and fulfill your success—only you are virtuous.
You have been diligent in the state, frugal in your household, and have not been arrogant or presumptuous—only you are virtuous.
You alone do not boast, and none under Heaven will contend with you in ability.
You alone do not vaunt, and none under Heaven will contend with you in merit.
I extol your virtue and praise your great achievements.
The celestial mandate rests upon you—you shall ascend to become the sovereign of the realm."*

*End of the hand-copied annotations for Volume Seventeen of The Daoist Classic of Virtue and Power*
*Beginning of Volume Eighteen*
*Collected Works of the Recluse Wang Shouzheng of Five-Peak Serenity*
*Chapter Sixty-Seven: "All Under Heaven"*

I possess three treasures, which I cherish and uphold:
One is called **benevolence (慈)**, two is called **frugality (俭)**, three is called **"not daring to act before all under Heaven (不敢为天下先)**."

*Annotations expand upon:*
The Great Yu cultivated his conduct, and **restraint (克检)** was his virtue.
King Wen of Zhou governed with **frugality as his Dao (化)**.

*Hand-copied excerpt from The Classic of Documents (尚书)□Yu’s Discourse (大禹谟):*
"Frugal in your household, not arrogant or presumptuous—only you are virtuous.
Again, it is said that **frugality was King Wen’s Dao**.
This is the **achievement (功致)** of the ode *"The Ram and the Magpie’s Nest"* from *The Mao Poems (毛诗)□Country Songs (国风)□羔羊□鹊巢*.
The customs of the Southern Chu state reflect King Wen’s governance, where all in office practiced **frugality and rectitude (节俭正直)**, their virtue as gentle as a ram.

*The Classic of Documents (书) states:*
‘**Reverence and frugality are the essence of virtue (恭俭惟德)**.
This is the language of *The Classic of Documents□The Officers of Zhou (周官篇)*:
**"One’s station does not invite arrogance, one’s emoluments do not invite excess—reverence and frugality are the essence of virtue, lest you bear falsehood (无载尔伪).**
To act with **virtue brings ease to the heart and rest on the day (作德心逸日休)**,
To act with **falsehood brings labor to the heart and clumsiness on the day (作伪心劳日拙).**

**Benevolence (慈)** thus enables **courage (勇)**.
**Frugality (俭)** thus enables **breadth (广)**.
**"Not daring to act before all under Heaven (不敢为天下先)"** thus enables **completion of great works and enduring leadership (成器长)**.

*Annotations expand upon:*
Mencius said: **"The virtuous have no rival (仁者无敌)."**
*Hand-copied excerpt from Mencius□The Sentences of King Hui of Liang (梁惠王章句上):*
Mencius’ reply to King Hui of Liang.
If he drowned his people, and you went to punish him—who would dare rival the king?
Thus it is said: **"The virtuous have no rival, O king—do not doubt."**

*Annotations expand upon:*
Emperor Shun was **by nature virtuous (性仁)**, and his punishments were limited to four crimes.
*Hand-copied excerpt from Mencius□The Exhaustion of the Heart (尽心上):*
Mencius said: **"Yao and Shun were virtuous by nature, Tang and Wu by personal cultivation, the Five Hegemons by borrowed virtue. If borrowed virtue does not return, how can one know it is not their own?"**

The four crimes:
**Banish Gonggong to Yzhou (幽州)**, sending him far away, like water flowing.
**Exile Huantuo to the lofty mountains (崇山)**, placing him there and not allowing him to go elsewhere.
**Drive the Three Miao to the Three Perils (三危)**, banishing them into turmoil and confinement.
**Imprison Gun at Yushan (羽山)**.
**Imprisonment (殛)** means to **detain, confine, and subject to hardship**.
With these four crimes, all under Heaven submitted.

*Annotations expand upon:*
King Tang of Shang **cultivated virtue (克仁)**, and could overcome the tyranny of Xia Jie.
*Hand-copied excerpt from The Classic of Documents□The Admonitions of Zhonghu (仲虺之诰):*
"Only the king does not indulge in sounds and colors, does not amass wealth and profit.
**He magnifies virtue in his appointments, and magnifies virtue in his rewards (德懋懋官，功懋懋赏).**
He uses people only for their own worth, and does not spare correction.
**He is broad in virtue and broad in benevolence (克宽克仁), making his trust manifest to the myriad people (彰信兆民).**

*The Admonitions of Tang (汤诰) say:*
‘The king of Xia extinguished virtue and relied on coercion, spreading his cruelty to all your myriad regions and people.
Your myriad regions and people suffered his calamities, unable to endure his torments, and together they reported their innocence to the gods above and below.
**The Dao of Heaven bestows blessings upon the virtuous and misfortune upon the licentious (福善祸淫)**,
Bringing disaster upon Xia to **make their crimes evident (彰厥罪)**.’

*Annotations expand upon:*
King Wen **regarded the people as wounded (视民如伤)**.
*Hand-copied excerpt from Mencius□The Sentences of Li Lou (离娄章句下):*
Mencius said:
Yu **hated fine food and drink but loved virtuous words (恶旨酒而好善言)**.
Tang **held the middle course (执中)**, establishing the virtuous without regard to rank.
King Wen **regarded the people as wounded**, seeking the Dao but not yet seeing it.
King Wu **did not neglect the near (不泄迩)**, nor **forgot the far (不忘远)**.
Duke Zhou of Zhou **pondered the Three Kings (思兼三王)**, applying the **Four Affairs (四事)**.
If there were any discrepancies, he **looked upward and reflected (仰而思之)**, continuing through the night.
Fortunate if he found them, he **sat in contemplation until dawn (坐以待旦)**.’

「Extended commentary states: *"To pacify the people of the world with a single act of righteous anger—is this not courage?"*
From the hand-copied *Mencius□Liang Hui Wang Chapter (梁惠王章句下)*, Mencius replied to King Xiang of Qi:
*"This is the courage of a commoner—able to confront one man. Your Majesty seeks greater virtue.*
*The Odes say:*
*'The King’s wrath blazed forth—
He marshaled his host,
To check the march of the Zou and Ju,
To strengthen Zhou’s blessings,
And answer the world’s longing gaze.'*
*This is the courage of King Wen.
King Wen pacified the world with a single act of righteous anger.*
*Annotation (from *Odes□Great Odes□Huang Yi*):*
*‘Heru’—form of anger.
‘Yuan’—‘at’ (indicating purpose).
‘Lǚ’—the multitude.
‘È’—to restrain.
‘Cu’—‘to go’ (referring to the Min people invading the Ruan and Cu clans).
‘Dù’—‘thick’ (i.e., abundant).
‘Hù’—‘blessing’ (favor).
‘Duì’—‘to respond’ (to the people’s hopes).
*This is the great courage of King Wen.*

Extended commentary states: *The *Book of Documents* says:*
*"Be cautious with your frugal virtue,
For it holds eternal designs."*
From the hand-copied *Book of Documents□Tai Jia Shang (太甲上)*, Yi Yin spoke:
*"The ancient kings were enlightened yet humble,
Sitting in contemplation till dawn.
They sought worthy talent,
Enlightening later generations,
Lest they exceed their mandate and bring ruin upon themselves.
Be cautious with your frugal virtue,
For it holds eternal designs."*

Extended commentary states: *As when Emperor Wen abandoned the Luotai Pavilion,
Wearing coarse hemp garments himself,
Setting frugality as an example for the world.*
Hand-copied excerpt:
*Emperor Wen intended to build the Luotai Pavilion and consulted artisans, who estimated the cost at a hundred *jin* (gold coins).
The Emperor said: *"A hundred *jin*—enough to support ten average families! I maintain the palaces of my ancestors, often fearing they shame me. Why build a pavilion?"*
He wore hemp garments himself,
And though his concubines’ robes were thick silk,
They did not trail the ground,
Nor were curtains embroidered—
Thus demonstrating frugality as an example for the world.*

Extended commentary states: *As when Emperor Taizong halted palace construction,
Taking heed of Qin’s downfall,
Wearing no brocade,
Yet ensuring prosperity for both court and commoners.*
Hand-copied excerpt from *Tang Taizong’s Zhenguan Era (贞观四年诏)*:
*He ordered soldiers to repair the Buyan Palace’s Qianyuan Hall for imperial inspections.
Chancellor Zhang Xuan-su submitted a memorial urging cessation:
*"Qin Shihuang, seizing Zhou’s remnants and the strength of the Six Kingdoms,
Was told: ‘When Alang Palace was finished, Qin’s people scattered;
When Zhanghua was built, Chu’s forces fractured.
May Your Majesty take warning.
If labor is to be done, let it be halted now.
Abandon mercy for boldness,
Frugality for extravagance,
Posterity for immediate gain—
Then you are doomed."*

Extended commentary states: *Thus leading to the ultimate calamity of drowning in excess.*
From the *I Ching□Great Excess (大过)*:
*Wind (巽) below, Lake (兑) above.
Wind’s joyful movement—
With this, one crosses difficulties, and difficulties are overcome.*
*Hexagram line six: "Excessive transgression—drowning peril, yet no blame."*
*Annotation: At the extreme of *Great Excess*, the transgression is severe.
Crossing difficulties to the point of drowning.
Though perilous, the intent to save the age brings no fault.*
*Mercy—
In war, it brings victory;
In defense, it secures strength.
When Heaven intends to save, it shields with mercy.*

Extended commentary states: *As in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Xuan of Lu, Year 15,
When Duke Huan of Qin attacked Jin at Fu Shi.*
*The event is detailed in the *Commentary*, so it is not repeated here.*

Extended commentary states: *Five chapters warn against militarism.
Chapter 30: "Do not use force to dominate the world."
Chapter 31: "Fine weapons are instruments of ill omen."
Chapter 57: "Use unconventional tactics in war."
Chapter 69: "War has its principles."
Chapter 76: "Military strength leads to defeat."

One chapter warns against killing.
Chapter 72: "Courage without restraint leads to slaughter."

Three chapters advocate frugality over extravagance.
Chapter 29: "The Sage avoids excess, extravagance, and extremism."
Chapter 67: "First, mercy; second, frugality; third, not daring to lead the world."
Chapter 59: "In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality."

Fifteen chapters caution against weakness and passivity.
Chapter 3: "Weaken the will, strengthen the bones."
Chapter 40: "The weak are the Way’s application."
Chapter 55: "Though bones are weak and sinews soft, the grip is firm."
Chapter 36: "The soft overcomes the hard."
Chapter 76: "Human life begins soft and weak."
Chapter 78: "Nothing in the world is softer than water."
Chapter 39: "I call myself ‘lonely and barren.’"
Chapter 52: "Seeing what is small is clarity; holding to softness is strength."
Chapter 66: "Because it does not contend, none can contend with it."

Chapter 81: "The *Dao* does not contend, yet it is good at victory."
*Chapter on the Virtuous Warrior (善为士):*
Chapter 68: "The skilled warrior does not rage."

Extended commentary states: *As with Shì Nán Yí Liáo,
Who resolved the dispute between the Nine and Two families.*
From the hand-copied *Zhuangzi□Xu Wu Gui (徐无鬼)*:
*When Confucius traveled to Chu, the Chu King offered him wine.
Sun Chu’ao held the cup, while Shì Nán Yí Liáo received the wine and poured a libation, saying:
*"The ancients spoke thus—
I have heard the unsaid words,
But never spoken them myself."*
Shì Nán Yí Liáo played with a ball—
Yí Liáo, Chu’s mighty warrior.
During the White Banner Rebellion,
He killed the Prime Minister Zi Xi and Zi Qi.
Stone Qi said:
*"Shì Nán Yí Liáo—
If secured, he could rival five hundred men—
Yet when sent for, he refused."*

*Chapter on the Virtuous Warrior (善为士):*
Chapter 69: "The skilled warrior does not contend with arms, yet he is good at victory."

Sun Chu’ao lay in comfort, fanning himself with an ostrich-feather fan, while the people of Ying cast their weapons aside. Sun Chu’ao was the Prime Minister (令尹) of Chu—a man of great virtue and power (賢德). Ying was the capital of Chu. With his ease and high pillow, Chu’ao wielded his fan in leisure, yet his influence ensured that no enemy state dared invade. This demonstrates the two sons' ability to achieve such harmony.

Extended commentary states: *As with Tang’s release of Jie,
And King Wu’s conquest of Zhou—
Both men’s single burst of anger brought peace to all under Heaven.*

From the hand-copied *Shàngshū□Zhōnghuì Zhī Guì (仲虺之诰)*:
*On the first month, the 10th day (壬辰), Tang released Jie to the southern nest (南巢)—
A place name, referring to the city of Hao (巢城) in Lujiang (庐江).*
*The* *Wǔchéng (武成)* *chapter states:
*"On the 10th day of the first month, the sun’s shadow was cast to the side (旁死魄).
The next day, the 11th (癸巳), the king of Zhou marched forth from the capital,
To subdue the Shang in battle."*
*The* *Mèngzǐ□Liáng Huì Wáng Xià (梁惠王下)* *states:
*"One man alone could have balanced the world—
Yet King Wu was ashamed of such a thought."*
*This was King Wu’s martial virtue (勇).*
*King Wu too, in his single burst of anger, brought peace to all under Heaven.*

The skilled warrior does not contend (善勝敵者不爭), yet he is good at victory.
The skilled ruler does not vie for position (善用人者為之下).

Extended commentary states: *To contend over land with war,
And fill the fields with corpses—
To contend over cities with war,
And fill the cities with corpses—
This is called leading the land to devour human flesh,
A crime too heinous even for death.*
Extended commentary cites *Mèngzǐ□Lí Lóu Shàng (離娄上)*:
*"How much more so when one makes others fight fiercely,
Contending over land with war,
And filling the fields with corpses—
Contending over cities with war,
And filling the cities with corpses!
This is called leading the land to devour human flesh,
A crime too heinous even for death."*

Extended commentary states: *The* *Shǐjì (史记)* *records how the Wei envoy, General Xin (新), and General Huan (桓衍), entered Han Dan (邯郸).*
*The meaning has already been detailed in the commentary above; it will not be repeated here.*

It is further stated: *As with King Mu of Zhou’s commissioning of Jun Ya (君牙) as his stock and sinew (股肱), heart and strength (心膂).*
From the hand-copied *Shàngshū□Jūn Yá (君牙)*:
*"It is I, the lesser heir, who now upholds the legacy of Wen, Wu, Cheng, and Kang.
I am also the servant of the former kings,
Who could pacify chaos both left and right, in all directions.
My heart’s concerns are grave—
Like stepping on a tiger’s tail,
Or wading through spring ice.
Now I entrust you with my wings,
To serve as my stock and sinew (股肱),
Heart and strength (心膂),
And pierce through your old armor (舊服).
Do not shame your ancestors."*

Extended commentary states: *The* *Hànshū (汉书)* *records how the High Ancestor (高祖) ruled Han Zhong (汉中).*
*The meaning has already been detailed in the commentary above; it will not be repeated here.*

This is called the virtue of non-contention (不爭之德),
This is called the power of using others (用人之力),
This is called aligning with Heaven (配天),
The ultimate ideal of the ancients.

Extended commentary states: *As with Wei’s Wu Qi (吳起) as a general.*
*The meaning has already been detailed in the* *Shǐjì (史记)* *above; it will not be repeated here.*

*Chapter on the Use of Arms (用兵有言)* concludes.

This is called walking without walking,
Pushing without arms,
Returning without enemies,
Seizing without weapons.

Extended commentary states: *The disciplined troops of the Banded Teacher.*
Quoted from *The Book of Documents (尚书)*—*Great Yu’s Discourse (大禹谟)*—it says:
*"With utmost sincerity, one moves the spirits; how much more so with the Miao rebels!*
Yu bowed and said to Chang: *‘Indeed, let the Banded Teacher rally the troops.’*
The Emperor then displayed his refined virtue,
Dancing with the dry-grass feathers on the two tiers,
And in seventy days, the Miao rebels were subdued.
*Banded (斑), to return (还);*
*Rally (振), to discipline (整).*
This means disciplining the troops to return them.
The Banded Teacher went to the Miao state,
And rallied the troops in the capital.

Extended commentary states: *Weapons are the five arms—bows, spears, maces, halberds, and axes.*
Quoted: *The five arms are:*
*One, the bow;*
*Two, the spear—*as in the *Book of Songs (诗)*: *"The elder holds the spear."*
*Three, the mace;*
*Four, the halberd;*
*Five, the axe—*with branches, it is called an axe.
*No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy,*
For underestimating the enemy risks losing our treasure.

Extended commentary states: *Underestimating the enemy—*
As in the *Spring and Autumn Annals (春秋)*, Duke Ling of Lu, 33rd year.
Quoted from the *Spring and Autumn Annals (春秋)*, Duke Ling of Lu, 33rd year:
*The Qin troops passed through the northern gate.*
The meaning has already been detailed; it will not be repeated.

**Chapter: My Teachings Are Very Easy to Know, Very Easy to Practice (吾言甚易知章第七十)**

My teachings are very easy to know,
Very easy to practice.
Yet none under Heaven can know them,
None can practice them.

Extended commentary states: *Mencius said:*
*"The Dao is like a great road;*
Yet who would say it is difficult to know?
People fail because they do not seek it earnestly.
If you return and seek it,
There will be many teachers.
This means the Dao is not difficult to know.
If you return and seek it,
Regarding filial piety and respecting elders,
Then all ten thousand principles within human nature are complete.
Teachers can be found everywhere without fail,
There is no need to stay here and receive instruction.
Thus, the Sage wears coarse cloth while holding precious virtue."*

Extended commentary states: *Zhuangzi saw Duke Ai of Lu.*
Duke Ai said: *"Lu has many Confucians (儒)."*
Quoted from *Zhuangzi*—*The Master’s Son, Tian Zi Fang (田子方篇)*—
The meaning has already been fully detailed; it will not be repeated.

**Chapter: Know Not Knowing (知不知上章第七十)**

Know not knowing—*this is superior.*
Not knowing knowing—*this is a sickness.*

Extended commentary states: *The Dao cannot be reached by mere thought and deliberation; thus, it cannot be known.*
Quoted from *Zhuangzi*—*The Wanderings of the Knowing (知北游篇)*—it says:
*Zhi Bei wandered above the Dark Waters,*
Ascended the Hidden Peak’s hill,
And met the Master of Non-Action.
Zhi Bei said to the Master of Non-Action:
*"May I ask you, Master:
What thoughts and deliberations lead one to know the Dao?
What place and manner bring one to dwell in the Dao?
What path and method allow one to attain the Dao?"*
The Master of Non-Action gave no answer.
Not that he refused to answer,
But that he did not know how to answer.

Extended commentary states: *The Master said to Zigong:*
*"Zigong, do you think I am one who learns much and knows it all?
No.
I merely use one principle to penetrate all things."*
Quoted from *The Analects*—*Chapter on Duke Ling of Wei (卫灵公十五)*—it says:
The Master said: *"It is not that I learn much and know it all,
But that I use one principle to penetrate all things."*
This means that all virtues under Heaven are unified by one principle.

Extended commentary states: *Zhuangzi said:*
*"The depth of not knowing is profound,
The shallowness of knowing is slight.
Not knowing is inward,
Knowing is outward.
Not knowing aligns with reason, thus profound and mysterious within,
Knowing defies the Dao, thus coarse and superficial without.
Only the sick worry about sickness,
And thus, they do not fall ill."*

Extended commentary states: *The Master said:*
*"The noble person worries about his own lack of ability,
Not about others’ failure to recognize him."*
Quoted from *The Analects*—*Chapter on Duke Ling of Wei (卫灵公十五)*—it says:
The noble person studies for himself,
Not seeking others’ recognition.
The Sage does not fall ill,
For he worries about his own lack of ability,
And thus, does not fall ill.

Extended commentary states: *As in* *Zhuangzi* *—*
*The recluse Nan Guo Zi Qi sat hidden in his chamber.*
Quoted from *Zhuangzi*—*The Spiritless Xu (徐无鬼篇)*—
The meaning has already been detailed; it will not be repeated.

**Chapter: The People Do Not Fear the Threat (民不畏威章第七十二)**

The people do not fear the threat,
Then the greatest threat arrives.

Extended commentary states: *That which is feared as a threat is called a threat.*
Quoted: In the *Spring and Autumn Annals (春秋)*, Duke Xiang of Lu, 31st year,
The Duke of Wei was in Chu.
North Palace Wenzi saw the Minister of War’s imposing manner and said to the Duke of Wei:
*"The Minister of War resembles a ruler with ambitions beyond his station.
His speech and bearing are not constant."*
The Duke said: *"How do you know this?"*

The Minister replied: *"The* **Odes** *say:*
*'With reverence and caution toward dignity and bearing,
This is the standard for the people.'*
If the Minister of War lacks dignity and bearing,
The people have no standard to follow.
That which the people do not emulate,
If it exists among those above them,
They cannot endure it long.
The Duke said: 'Well spoken!'
What do you mean by *dignity and bearing*?'

The Minister replied: *"There is the awe-inspiring aspect that commands fear,
And the conduct that serves as a model—
This is called *dignity and bearing*.
The ruler possesses the ruler’s *dignity and bearing*;
His ministers, in awe yet loving him,
Take him as their standard and emulate him.
Thus he can hold his state,
And his fame endure through generations.
The minister possesses the minister’s *dignity and bearing*;
His subordinates, in awe yet loving him,
Thus can guard their offices,
And preserve their clans, making their households prosperous."*

Extended commentary states: *The virtuous person has three things to fear:*
*Fear of Heaven’s command,*
*Fear of the great ones,*
*Fear of the words of the sages.*
Quoted from *The Analects*—*Chapter on the Ji Family (季氏第十六)*—
Confucius said:
*"The virtuous person has three things to fear:*
*Fear of Heaven’s command,*
*Fear of the great ones,*
*Fear of the words of the sages.*
The petty person does not know Heaven’s command and does not fear it,
He treats the great ones with familiarity and scorns the words of the sages.
He does not narrow his dwelling,
Nor exhaust his life’s sustenance.
Only because he does not exhaust it,
Is he not exhausted."*

Extended commentary states: *The heart is the dwelling of the spirit.*
Quoted from *Zhuangzi*—*Knowing the North (知北游)*—
**Bìxiè** questioned **Pīyī** while he sat with his robe unfastened.
**Bìxiè** was a disciple of **Wáng Ní**,
And **Pīyī** was **Wáng Ní**’s teacher.
**Pīyī** said:
*"If you straighten your form,
And unify your gaze,
The harmony of Heaven will arrive.
Gather your knowledge,
And unify your measure,
The spirit will come to dwell within you.
Your *virtue* will become your adornment,
And the *Dao* will become your abode."*

The extended commentary states:
*"Only by purging defilement and stilling thought,
And calming the heart to hold fast to Oneness,
Does one attain the Way’s essence.
This is quoted from the *Sutra of Ascension to the West* (《西升经》), in the chapter on Precepts and Admonitions.
The Most High [Laozi] transmitted the scripture to Master Yin [Emperor of Truth], and when the transmission was complete, he prepared to ascend to Taixi [the Celestial Pole].
Thus, he spoke again to Master Yin:
*'Purge defilement, still thought,
Calm the heart, hold fast to Oneness.
When all defilements are purged, all matters are complete—
This is the essence of my Dao.
Therefore, the Sage knows himself without self-regard,
Loves himself without self-exaltation,
And thus discards that to take this.'*

The extended commentary states:
*'Nanguo Ziqiu sat reclined at his ease.'
This is quoted from *Zhuangzi*—*Equating Things* (《齐物篇》).
The meaning is already complete; no need to repeat it.

The extended commentary states:
*'If one were to govern as Lie Yukou did,
He would turn back mid-course.'
This is quoted from *Zhuangzi*—*Lie Yukou*.
The meaning is already detailed; no need to repeat it.*

The *Extended Commentary on the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic* (《道德真经衍义》) concludes its eighteenth handwritten scroll.
The *Extended Commentary on the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic* begins its nineteenth handwritten scroll.
Collected by the reclusive scholar of Five Peaks, Wang Shouzheng (王守正).
Chapter Seventy-Three: *Courage in Daring* (《勇於敢》)."

Knowing these two [paths], one may bring benefit or harm.
What Heaven abhors, who can fathom its reason?
Thus, even the Sage finds this difficult.

The *Extended Commentary* states:
Mencius said: *"Is the archer less benevolent than the coffin-maker?
The archer fears not striking a man, while the coffin-maker fears striking one.
So too with sorcerers and artisans—thus, their methods must be approached with caution."*
**Note:** *Han* (函) means *armor* (甲).

The heart of compassion is innate in all.
The archer’s intent is not inherently less benevolent than the coffin-maker’s.
The sorcerer invokes blessings for life’s continuation,
The artisan crafts coffins—serving death’s necessity.
It is further said: *"Those who align with Heaven endure; those who defy it perish."*
Quoting from *Mencius—*[*Li Lou (离娄) Upper*]:
Mencius said: *"In an age of Dao, lesser virtue serves greater virtue, lesser wisdom serves greater wisdom.
In an age without Dao, the weak serve the strong, the small serve the great.
These two outcomes are Heaven’s decree.
Those who align with Heaven endure; those who defy it perish.
In an age of Dao, all cultivate virtue, and rank accords with its magnitude.
In an age without Dao, virtue is neglected, and only brute force dictates servitude.
Heaven’s Way is the natural order of principle and efficacy.
Heaven’s Dao conquers without strife, responds without speech, and arrives without summons.
Its designs unfold effortlessly and wisely."*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"What does Heaven speak?*
The four seasons proceed, myriad things flourish—what does Heaven speak?"
Quoting from *Analects—*[*Yang Huo (阳货) Seventeenth*]:
The Master said: *"I wish to say nothing."*
Zigong replied: *"If you speak not, how shall we be enlightened?"*
The Master said: *"What does Heaven speak?
The four seasons proceed, myriad things flourish—what does Heaven speak?"*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"Yan Hui, the foremost disciple of Confucius’ school, the greatest of benevolent sages, yet Heaven cut short his life."*
Quoting from *Analects—*[*Yong Ye (雍也) Sixth*]:
Duke Ai asked which disciple was most studious.
Confucius replied: *"There was Yan Hui, who loved learning.
Alas, his life was brief—he has passed.
Now, he is gone."*

Some say he died at thirty-two.
Zhuangzi records: *"He died at eighteen."*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"Dizhi the Bandit was the robber of Dongling—
though the origin of violence and oppression,
he yet preserved his natural lifespan."*

Quoting from *Zhuangzi—[The Bandit Dizhi]*:
*"Dongling"*—a place name.
*"Dizhi"*—the Bandit, younger brother of Liu Xiaohui.
The *Book of Han* states:
*"Dizhi was a great thief of Qin,
bold and resolute, gathering thousands of armed men
to roam the world.
He plundered the feudal lords, drove off their cattle and horses,
seized their wives and daughters—
the common people suffered greatly."*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"Deng You perished at the end of Yongjia under Shi Le.
It also cites Li Maozhen, the Jiedu of Fengxiang in the late Tang.
These two events are fully recorded in the *Yi Zhong*—
no need to repeat them here."*

**Chapter Seventy-Four: The People Do Not Fear Death**
*"The people do not fear death—
why then threaten them with death?"*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"Man is born in stillness—
this is the nature of Heaven."*

Quoting from *Records of Rites—[The Record of Music]*:
*"Man is born in stillness—
this is the nature of Heaven.
Stirred by things, he moves—
this is the desire of nature."*

This speaks of man’s original state,
when he received Heaven’s pure, natural essence—
untainted and clear.
But once stirred by external influences,
desires arise, passions clash,
and the heart’s cravings defile the nature—
then Heaven’s pure essence is obscured and cannot manifest.

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"When governance is burdensome and punishments severe,
the people have no place to turn."*

Quoting from *Analects—[Zilu Thirteenth]*:
*"..."*

「Zilu said: "The ruler of Wei awaits you to govern, what would you prioritize?"
The Master replied: "You must first rectify the names."
Zilu said: "Indeed, Master, your ways are so roundabout. Why rectify names?"
The Master said: "How uncouth, Ru! A gentleman, when faced with what he does not know, simply remains silent.
When names are not rectified, words lack harmony.
When words lack harmony, deeds cannot be accomplished.
When deeds cannot be accomplished, rituals and music do not flourish.
When rituals and music do not flourish, punishments are not just.
When punishments are not just, the people have no place to turn.
There will always be those who execute the kill—
this is what the *Extended Commentary* calls *‘substituting the executioner to hew.’*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"Like Shun’s punishment of the Four Evils,
or the Duke of Zhou’s handling of the Guans and Caix,
this is the case."*

Quoting from *The Book of Documents—[Shun’s Canon]*:
*"Exile Gonggong to Yōuzhōu,
banish Huàntuó to Chóngshān,
banish the Sānmáo to Sānwēi,
slay Gǔn at Yǔshān.
With these four punishments, all under Heaven submitted."*

And citing the Duke of Zhou’s actions against the Guans and Caix from *The Book of Documents—[The Golden Seal]*:
*"After King Wu’s demise,
Guan Shu and his band of brothers spread false rumors in the state:
‘The Duke will harm the young king.’
Guan Shu, whose name was Xiān,
was King Wu’s younger brother,
and the Duke of Zhou’s elder brother.
His fellow brothers included Cai Shu, whose name was Dù,
and Huo Shu, whose name was Chǔ.
False rumors—words without foundation,
like flowing water, spreading from there to here."*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"The Southern Palace holds the Vermilion Register,
awarding merit and overseeing life;
the Northern Palace holds the Black Ledger,
recording offenses and presiding over death."*

Quoting from *The Three Elements Scripture*:
*"The Southern Palace holds the Vermilion Register,
awarding merit and overseeing life;
the Northern Palace holds the Black Ledger,
recording offenses and presiding over death.*
These four stars examine humanity’s good and evil,
judging the weight of their deeds,
to admonish and encourage all,
so that the world may cultivate virtue and avoid vice.
Those who do not cultivate virtue,
the Heavenly Executioners will slay them themselves.
Heaven’s gaze is clear—
none escape its scrutiny.
Heaven’s net is vast,
though wide, it does not fail to catch.
To defy Heaven and invert the Dao—
how could one evade retribution?

To substitute the Executioner’s role in killing—
this is called *‘substituting the master carpenter to hew.’*
To substitute the master carpenter’s hewing—
rarely does one not harm their own hands."*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"Heaven punishes the guilty with the Five Punishments."*

Quoting from *The Book of Documents—[Gāoyáo’s Discourse]* (Fourth Annotation):
*"Heaven punishes those who commit crimes,
applying the Five Graded Punishments to admonish them.
To bestow noble titles and administer rewards and punishments—
this is the duty of the sovereign.
When the ruler’s ministers employ them,
they must do so with diligence and not slackness."*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"The people of Qi attacked Yan;
some asked Mencius: ‘Is there justification for urging Qi to attack Yan?’"*

Quoting from *Mencius—[Gōngsūn Chǒu, Lower]*:
*"Shen Tong asked whether Yan could be attacked.
This has already been recorded in the *‘Righteousness’* section—
no need to repeat it."*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"King Ling of Chu said:
‘I have slain many a man’s son.
Could it be that Heaven is punishing me?’"*

Quoting from *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, Year 13 of Duke Zhao:
*"The Chu prince Bǐ, along with his four clansmen,
invaded Chu and killed Prince Lù and Prince Bàdí.
When the king heard of the deaths of the princes,
he threw himself beneath the carriage and cried:
‘How could people love their own sons
as I love mine?’
The king said:
‘I have slain many a man’s son—
could it be that I have escaped this fate?
Is this not Heaven’s retribution upon me?’"*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"The Qin’s cruelty was widespread—
this is not worth mentioning."*

Quoting from *The Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government*, Sima Guang said:
*"When Qin Shǐhuáng was poisoning the world,
Meng Tian acted as his enforcer—
his lack of humanity is clear.
Yet, though he had no crime to merit execution,
he remained steadfast to his death—
this is also worthy of commendation."*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"Li Junxian was killed due to suspicion and hearsay."*

Quoting from *The Comprehensive Mirror*, Year 22 of Zhenguan:
*"Initially, the General of the Martial Guard,
Li Junxian, the Marquis of Wǔlián County,
stood watch at the Xuanwu Gate.
At the time, the Great White Star appeared in daylight,
and the astrologers divined:
‘A woman will prosper.’
Commoners also spread the *Secret Record*:
‘After the Tang’s third generation,
a female sovereign, the Martial King,
will inherit the realm.’
The Emperor loathed this.
At a banquet with the martial officers in the palace,
he commanded them to recite their childhood names.
Li Junxian spoke his own name as Wǔniáng.
The Emperor was startled,
then laughed and said:
‘What kind of woman is this?
Yet how bold and vigorous she is!’
Moreover, Li Junxian’s official title and封邑 all bore the character *‘martial’* (武),
deepening the Emperor’s disdain.
Later, he was sent to govern Huá Zhōu,
where he was executed.
He was killed due to suspicion and hearsay."*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"Wang Jingwen was killed due to jealousy and distrust."*

Quoting:
*"During the first year of Emperor Ming of Song’s reign,
when the Emperor’s illness grew severe,
he feared that after his death,
the Empress Dowager would rule as regent.
Wang Jingwen, as the uncle of the Emperor’s generation,
would surely become the Chancellor.
His clan was powerful,
and some might harbor treacherous intentions,
so the Emperor sent envoys to grant Jingwen’s death.
He wrote in his own hand:
‘I have dealt with you as such,
to preserve your family’s safety,
thus this arrangement.’
Jingwen accepted the imperial decree and drank poison,
dying immediately.
He was killed due to jealousy and distrust."*

The *Extended Commentary* states:
*"The scholars of Han and Tang,
plotted to exterminate the eunuchs—
the eunuchs’ crimes were indeed grave."*

Quoting from *The Detailed Annals of the Eastern Han*:
*"During Emperor Ling of Han’s reign,
the General of the Army, Hé Jìn,
and the warlord, Dǒng Zhuó,
conspired to eliminate the eunuchs.
The eunuchs’ crimes were indeed grave."*

The Clerk Chen Lin remonstrated, saying:
*"The* Classic of Changes *declares, ‘Even a fawn cannot be captured without alarm.’*
To hunt a deer is still to follow its tracks—
*Without alarm* means it cannot be done.
The proverb says, ‘Plucking sparrows with covered eyes.’
Even small things cannot be deceived—
how much less can one deceive when in power?
Much less can one establish deceit in great national affairs!"

Hé Jìn would not listen.
He then summoned the regional garrisons, speaking of exterminating the eunuchs.
Hé Jìn’s resolve wavered, and later, when he entered the palace, he was beheaded by Zhang Let, Qu Mu, and others.

From *The Detailed Annals of the Tang*:
The eunuch Cheng Yuanzhen, a native of San Yuan in Jingzhao,
served Emperor Daizong of Tang and was promoted to General of the Cavalry.
At the beginning of Guangde,
the Taichang Scholar Gǒu Liú remonstrated in a memorial:
*"The people’s resentment stems from Your Majesty’s distance from the worthy and virtuous,
your reliance on eunuchs,
your estrangement of generals and ministers,
and the near-destruction of the dynasty.
If you wish to preserve the imperial lineage,
you must behead Yuanzhen and proclaim it to the realm."*

The memorial was received, and an edict was issued to strip Yuanzhen of all titles and ranks,
exiling him to Chenzhou, where he died.

Though five centuries separated Han and Tang,
both fell into chaos and ruin,
yet they followed the same path.
The calamity of eunuchs—
whether they wielded military power
or relied on favor—
is a root of disaster that cannot be fully eradicated.
Yet it is not Heaven’s will to abandon them;
it is the work of human plotting.

The *Yì* states: *"The Chu-Han War."* It quotes *Tongjian*: *"In the fourth year of Emperor Gaozū’s reign, Qiāo Chè said: Now that Chu and Han are locked in contention, the land is drenched with the blood of its people, their bones exposed in the wild—numberless father and sons. The *Yì* states: *"The chaos of the Five Dynasties saw ten families reduced to one, slaughter and annihilation rampant."* It quotes *Tongjian’s Detailed Notes*, where Hú says: *"The Five Dynasties’ turmoil—this ‘flooding of rivers and seas’—where subjects slew their sovereigns, sons slew their fathers, the innocent were butchered, blood ran like streams, corpses blanketed the fields—all these were the work of human desire to kill, and none escaped the fate of harming their own hands like the carpenter’s axe. Such was the inevitable injury."*

**The People’s Hunger (Chapter 75):**
*"The people’s hunger arises from the heavy burdens of their rulers’ taxes. Thus, hunger is born."*

The *Yì* states: *"Duke Ai asked Yǒu Ruò: ‘In a year of famine, when resources are scarce, what should we do?’"* It quotes *The Analects (Lún Yǔ, □Yán Wén, 12th Chapter)*: *"Yǒu Ruò replied to Duke Ai’s words."*

You Ruò replied: *"Why not abolish the tithes?"*
The Duke said: *"If I reduce them to one in ten, I still lack sufficient revenue—how could I abolish them entirely?"*
**Simplified:** *Simplified* means *universal*—the practice of the *shí-yī* (tenth) tax being uniformly applied across the realm, hence *simplified*.

**Extended Commentary:**
The *Yòu* (幽王) of Zhou grew oppressive in taxation, and the poem *"Chǔ Cí"* (《楚茨》) censures him.
Quoted from *The Mao Commentary on the Odes* (《毛诗》□《小雅》□《楚茨》).
It censures King Yòu for his heavy burdens.
Excessive governance and taxation left fields and orchards barren, famine and plague descended, and the people perished in droves, fleeing en masse. Sacrifices went unfulfilled, hence the virtuous reflect upon antiquity.

**Extended Commentary:**
When the Duke of Wèi imposed heavy exactions, the poem *"Shuò Shǔ"* (《硕鼠》) arose.
Quoted from *The Mao Commentary on the Odes* (《毛诗》□《国风》□《硕鼠》).
The commoners censured their ruler for his greed, devouring the people like a great rat, neglecting governance, and hoarding wealth in fear like a monstrous rodent.

**Extended Commentary:**
As with Emperor Dàzōng of Táng hunting at Xīndiàn—already fully addressed, no repetition needed.

---
The people are difficult to govern because their rulers act excessively—thus, they are difficult to govern.

**Extended Commentary:**
The ruler’s gluttony for *jīxiān yùshí* (击鲜玉食)—*freshly slaughtered meat and jade food*—is a sign of decadence.
Quoted from *The Liezi* (《列子》□《周穆王》).
The *Huàrén* (化人) presented jade garments monthly and jade delicacies daily, yet still the ruler was not satisfied.
The mention of *jade garments and jade food* merely emphasizes their extravagance.

**Extended Commentary:**
Emperor Wǔ of Hàn ruled through strict legal codes—already fully recorded in *The Annals of Hàn*, no need to repeat.

---
The people grow reckless with death because their desire for life is insatiable—thus, they grow reckless with death.

**Extended Commentary:**
To the point where they would tread upon fire and water without fear.
Quoted from *The Analects* (《论语》□《卫灵公第十五》):
The Master said: *"The people’s attachment to *rén* (virtue) is greater than to water and fire. I have seen those who tread upon fire and die, but never those who tread upon virtue and die."*

Again, it cites those who face blades without flinching—this is from *The Zhōng Yōng* (《中庸》):
The Master said: *"The affairs of the world and the state may be equalized, honors and emoluments may be declined, blades may be trodden upon—but the *Zhōng Yōng* (Middle Way) cannot be attained."*

**Extended Commentary:**
As in *Zhuāngzi’s* account of the Great King (Dàwáng) dwelling at Qín:
Quoted from *The Zhuāngzi* (《庄子》□《让王篇_):
The Great King Zhòufù resided at Qín, but the *Dì* (狄人) attacked. Zhòufù—father of King Jì and ancestor of King Wén—refused their tribute in silk and horses, for they sought only land. He said: *"To dwell with a man’s brother while slaying his sibling, to dwell with a man’s father while slaying his child—I cannot bear it. Let them all reside here. What difference is there between serving me and serving the Dì?"*
Moreover, he had heard: *"Do not harm the nourisher with what is used to nourish."* Thus, he took his staff and departed.
The people followed in chains, and he established his state beneath the Qí Mountains.
The Great King Zhòufù may be said to have truly honored life.
Those who honor life neither, in wealth and nobility, harm their nourishment, nor, in poverty and lowliness, burden their form with gain.

**Extended Commentary:**
The mouth craves rich flavors, the body fine garments, the eyes beautiful colors, the ears pleasing sounds—
Quoted from *Zhuāngzi’s* words to Confucius in *The Thief Zhí* (《盗跖》).
Already detailed within, no need to repeat.

The span of human life is seventy-six years.
Thus, when strength is excessive in arms, it cannot prevail;
When strength is excessive in wood, it snaps.

**Extended Commentary:**
As when Wang Mang dispatched Wang Yi and Wang Lin to pacify the Eastern Plains.
Quoted from *The Han Biographies*, Section 69.
Wang Mang, styled Jùjūn, was the son of Emperor Xuan’s empress’s younger brother.
Ban Gu’s eulogy states:
*"Wang Mang first arose from the clan of the imperial consort,
Curbed his nature and exerted himself in virtue,
Seeking fame and reputation through sincerity.
His kin praised his filial piety, his teachers and friends revered his benevolence.
When he held office and assisted in governance,
During the reigns of Emperor Cheng and Emperor Ai,
He labored diligently for the state,
Upright in his conduct, his deeds always commended—
How could he be one who, though praised at home and abroad,
Feigned virtue while acting contrary to it?"*

Yet Mang, though lacking in virtue, possessed cunning and deceitful talent,
And leveraged the four generations of his family’s power,
Encountering a weakened Han dynasty with three severed imperial lines,
While the dowager empress’s longevity made him the clan’s patron—
Thus he indulged his treachery, consummating the crime of usurpation.

Speaking of this, it was also the work of fate,
Not something human strength could govern.

When he usurped the throne and ruled illegitimately,
His tyranny over the people reached the heavens,
His cruelty and wickedness knew no bounds,
His poison spread across the Central States,
His chaos extended to the barbarian lands—
Yet he still had not sated his desires.

Thus, within the Four Seas, the people lost their joy in life,
Their voices rose in tumult, their words clamored like dust.
Both court and commoners seethed with anger,
From near and far, they rose in revolt.
Cities fell unguarded, the state fractured,
Until the land’s towns and cities became ruins,
Mounds and graves were dug up,
Harm extended to all living beings,
And guilt fell upon the bones of the dead.

Among the treacherous ministers and wicked tyrants recorded in history,
None matched Wang Mang in the scale of his ruin.

Some say: *"Later Han’s Emperor Guangwu, with eight thousand men,
Defeated Wang Mang’s army of a million and executed him,
Restoring the Han dynasty to its former glory."*

**Extended Commentary:**
The Qin King Fú Jiān mobilized ninety-seven hundred thousand soldiers.
Quoted from: According to *The Book of Jin*,
Fú Jiān, styled Yǒnggù, was Jiān’s grandson and Xióng’s son.
Having usurped the imperial title, he appointed Wáng Měng as chancellor,
And pacified all the states—only the southeastern corner remained for Jin.
When Měng died, Jiān frequently convened his ministers,
Desiring to attack Jin.
The ministers all cited the Year Star and the Constellation Star in the Dipper and Ox,
Saying Jin’s division was not yet ripe for conquest.
There were omens of long stars in wells and water shadows,
And other portents too numerous to recount.
The monk Dào Ān joined in pleading against the war, but Jiān would not listen.

Thus he conscripted ninety-seven hundred thousand soldiers,
A thousand li long, their banners stretching into the distance—
Yet Mùróng Wěi, Mùróng Chuí, and others all secretly held back their troops,
And the army reached the city of Yī.
Jin’s Xiè Xuán, styled Yòuliú, led his forces to meet the enemy.
Jiān advanced to Leisurely Hill, arraying his troops along the Fēishuǐ River.
Xuán’s army could not cross.
Xuán sent word to Fú Róng:
*"You have crossed far into our lands,
Yet camp beside the river in formation—
Do you not wish for swift battle?"*
The troops gradually withdrew,
Allowing their soldiers room to maneuver.
Xuán said to his generals:
*"Let us rein in our horses and observe—
Is this not delightful?"*
Jiān’s men all said:
*"We should block the Fēishuǐ River,
Preventing them from crossing.
Our numbers are vast, theirs few—
We must ensure complete victory."*
Jiān said:
*"Retreat the army,
Let them pass,
And I will press my iron cavalry—
Hundreds of thousands strong—
To the riverbank and slaughter them."*
Róng also agreed.
Thus Jiān ordered the retreat,
And the troops, in confusion, could not halt.

「Then Xuán, along with Xié Yàn and Huán Yī, led eight thousand elite troops across the Fēishuǐ River. Xié Ān’s stone army withdrew slightly from Zhāng Wēi’s forces, and Xuán and Yàn pressed forward, engaging in a decisive battle south of the Fēishuǐ River.

Firm struck by an arrow in mid-stream, he beheaded Fú Róng on the battlefield. The enemy forces fled in disarray, trampling one another and drowning in the river, their numbers beyond reckoning. The Fēishuǐ ran red with blood. The remaining troops abandoned their armor and fled in the night; upon hearing the sound of wind and cranes, they mistook it for the approach of the imperial forces.

Exposed to the elements and suffering from hunger and cold, seventeen or eighteen out of every ten perished. Firm was thus utterly defeated and retreated to Cháng’ān.

Later, Mùróng Chōng raised his army, causing great turmoil within the Passes. Mùróng Chuí also rebelled against Firm and returned to Yè, proclaiming himself the Later Yān. Yáo Xīn likewise rebelled against Firm, proclaiming himself the Later Qín. Additionally, Lǚ Guāng declared himself the Later Liáng in Liáng State. Rebels and deserters proliferated like bristles on a hedgehog, with uprisings erupting everywhere. Cháng’ān was besieged and pressed by Mùróng Zhòng, its inhabitants facing dire peril.

Firm then left his eldest son, Tàizǐ Hóng, to defend the city, and fled with five hundred horsemen to Wǔjiāng Shān. There, he was captured by Yáo Xīn’s general Yǐn Wéi and delivered to Xīn, who ordered his abdication. Firm cursed him, and was slain by Xīn.

The realm’s Tàizǐ Hóng, along with Zhāng Dàfū and others, surrendered the city to Mùróng Chōng, and the state thereby perished.

Yǎn Yì further notes: If it were Emperor Yáng of the Sui Dynasty, commanding four hundred thousand troops to assemble at Píngyáng.

Quoted from *The Book of Sui*: Emperor Yáng’s given name was Guǎng. Upon Emperor Wén’s ascension, he was封 as Jìn Róng. His nature was one of artificial display; though he was praised for his仁孝 virtue, he deposed the heir-apparent and installed himself instead.

After taking the throne, he visited Luòyáng, established the Eastern Capital, and conscripted over a hundred thousand able-bodied men from Hé Nán to dredge the Píng Canal, reaching Huái and Sì. He commissioned a hundred thousand dragon and phoenix vessels, establishing their collective name. All were adorned with gold and jade, and he then proceeded to Jiāngdū.

His fleet stretched unbroken for a thousand miles, the prow and stern of his ships linked in endless succession.»

Eight years into his reign, he personally led troops to campaign against Liáo, claiming an army of two hundred thousand. The battle against Gāolí failed, and he recalled his forces.

In the thirteenth year, he visited Jiāngdū—now Yángzhōu—where the ancient Chǔ royal palace stood. There, Lǐ Mì, Dòu Jiàndé, and others raised their banners, and bandits proliferated, seizing and plundering counties across all the **Dào**. Rebel leaders vied for prominence, and no state or prefecture in the empire remained free of them. To compound the misery, famine and drought ravaged the land, with men and women dying in such numbers they could not be counted. Thus, Emperor Gāozǔ of Táng raised the banner of righteousness in Tàiyuán, entered Cháng'ān, and rescued the empire from its calamities, replacing Emperor Yáng (also called Yì or Shì).

Yáng was the son of the reigning sovereign. Initially, he was honored as the **Shànghuáng**, but later he was killed by Yǔhuà Guāngjí.

The following year, the Sui dynasty abdicated in favor of the Táng.

Emperor Gāozǔ and Emperor Tàizōng seized the opportunity to restore order, conquering the empire with merely three hundred thousand troops—like pulling down rotting wood or crushing withered branches—until the realm was finally pacified. Such were the fates of **Fú Jiān** and Emperor Yáng: true **"fēnbēng"** in the making.

As the *Lǔyǔ* states: *"A state divided by strife and disintegration is thus."* All the above examples share one fate: they relied on their strength and waged war to seek victory, yet met crushing defeat from which they could not recover.

As for the **Yìzhōng** of the *Chūnqiū* (Lǐ Gōng), when **Qín Mù Gōng** sought to attack Jìn, the matter has already been detailed in the **Yìzhōng**—no need to repeat it here.

Thus concludes the **Dàodé ZhēnJīng Yìzhōng Miàojiàn** scroll, the nineteenth of the **Miàojiàn**.

**Dao/Way and Virtue True Classic Elucidations Manuscript Roll Twenty**
*Collected by the Recluse of Five Peaks, Qing’an Rongsheng, Wang Shouzheng*

**Chapter Seventy-Seventh: The Dao/Way of Heaven**

The Dao/Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow.
The high it depresses, the low it raises,
The excessive it diminishes, the deficient it supplements.

**Elucidations:**
The bow’s use requires harmonizing materials and form,
So that slack and tension are balanced and effective.
*Quoted from the Zhou Li:*
The bowmaker crafts bows, gathering six materials—dry wood, sinew, horn, silk, glue, and lacquer—at their proper times.
When the six materials are gathered, the skilled artisan blends them.
The wood must be red-black with a resonant tone.
For long-range shooting, power is used; for deep penetration, straightness.
The horn should be green-white with a full tip.
Generally, autumn-killed horn is thick, spring-killed horn is thin.
The horn of young oxen is straight and glossy; that of old oxen is curved and rough.
When the three colors are complete, it is excellent—
Then in winter, dry the wood;
In summer, treat the sinew;
In spring, soften the horn;
In autumn, combine silk, glue, and lacquer.
When the form is set in cold, the bow neither sags nor strains.
With fine materials and skilled craftsmanship, made at the right time,
This is called *Sanjun* [Three Harmonies].

**Elucidations:**
*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"Establishing the Dao/Way of Heaven: yin and yang."*
*Quoted from the Zhouyi’s* Sayings on the Trigrams:
*"In ancient times, the Sage composed the Changes*
*To align with the principles of nature and life.*
Thus, the Dao/Way of Heaven is established as yin and yang,
The Dao/Way of Earth as softness and hardness,
The Dao/Way of Humanity as virtue and righteousness.
Combining the Three Powers and pairing them,
Thus the Changes form six lines into a hexagram.
Dividing yin and yang, alternating softness and hardness,
Thus the Changes form six positions into a chapter."

**Elucidations:**
The sun and moon, cold and heat,
Come and go in turn—
Thus, the excessive is diminished.
What departs is given to the deficient,
And the year’s work is fulfilled.
*Quoted from the Yi System:*
*"The sun departs, the moon arrives; the moon departs, the sun arrives.
The sun and moon push against each other, and light is born.
Cold departs, heat arrives; heat departs, cold arrives.
Cold and heat push against each other, and the year’s work is fulfilled.
Is this not so?"*

**Elucidations:**
Thus, raising the deficient and diminishing the excessive through humility,
Seeking balance and equitable distribution.
*Quoted:*
From the above text, the *Yi’s* Humility Hexagram’s symbol says:
*"The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements humility."*
Its image:
*"Earth over mountain: Humility.
The superior person, with compassion, aids the few,
Balancing things and distributing evenly."*
Now, taking these passages to illustrate
The warning of Heaven’s Dao/Way—depressing the high, raising the low.

Heaven’s Dao/Way diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,
But humanity’s Dao/Way is the opposite—
Diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive.

**Elucidations:**
The *Yi’s* Diminishing Hexagram says:
*"Diminish the lower, benefit the upper; its Dao/Way ascends."*
The Benefiting Hexagram says:
*"Diminish the upper, benefit the lower; the people rejoice without bound."*
*Quoted from the Yi:*
The Diminishing Hexagram’s *Simian* says:
*"Diminish the lower, benefit the upper; its Dao/Way ascends."*
The Benefiting Hexagram’s *Simian* says:
*"Diminish the upper, benefit the lower; the people rejoice without bound."*
From above to below, its Dao/Way shines greatly.
Moreover, according to the original hexagram’s interpretation,
In the T’ai Hexagram, diminishing the Nine at the third position
And benefiting the Nine at the top forms Diminishing.
In the Pi Hexagram, diminishing the Nine at the fourth position
And benefiting the Nine at the first forms Benefiting.
Thus, taking from the upper’s excess
To benefit the lower’s deficiency—
This is called Benefiting.
Its meaning:
Heaven’s Dao/Way is balanced—
The excessive must be diminished, the deficient must be supplemented,
Opposite to humanity’s Dao/Way.
This is diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive,
Taking from the many to benefit the few.
Now, combining the meanings of
Depressing the high, raising the low,
Diminishing the excessive, supplementing the deficient,
The essentials for governing the state and harmonizing the people,
The rules for cultivating oneself and aligning with the Dao/Way—
This is its unique virtue.
Who can serve the world with their excess?
Only those in accord with the Dao/Way.

**Elucidations:**
In the past, the Celestial Master Zhi Qianyou,
When alive, was renowned for his *Kaochao* method.
*Quoted from the Celestial Master’s Family Transmission:*
The full account is already in the *Elucidations*—
No need to repeat it here.

**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Soft and Weak of the World**

The soft and weak of the world have none more so than water,
Yet in assaulting the firm and strong, none can surpass it—
Its power cannot be exchanged.

**Elucidations:**
Water’s nature is gentle, yielding without contention,
Its motion and stillness adapt to the times,
Its form and shape conform to the vessel.

Quoted from

**Thus the Sage speaks:**

To bear the filth of the state—this is called the steward of the ancestral altars.
To bear the misfortunes of the state—this is called the sovereign of all under Heaven.
Upright speech as if inverted.

**Elucidations:**
If the sovereign can contain impurity and endure defilement,
Drawing all the faults of the myriad regions unto himself.

Quoted from *The Book of Documents* [□ *Tang’s Admonition*]:
*"If you have virtue, I dare not conceal it.
If the guilt lies with me, I dare not pardon myself—
Only let it be weighed in the heart of the Most High.
As for the myriad regions, if they have guilt, it lies with me alone.
If I alone bear guilt, I shall not harm the myriad regions."*

**Elucidations:**
In the Spring and Autumn period, Jin attacked Chu, advancing three *shè* without halt.
The ministers requested permission to strike.
Quoted from *The Honglei Explanations*:
*"Jin attacked Chu—three *shè* (each *shè* being thirty *li*)—and did not stop.
The ministers said: ‘May we strike?’
Zhuang Wang replied: ‘In the days of my predecessors, Jin did not attack Chu.’*
(The meaning is complete; no need to repeat the full text.)

**Elucidations:**
Song Jing Gong was afflicted by Upholder of the Stars [Mars] in the Heart constellation.
Quoted from *The Honglei Explanations* (the full text is preserved there; no need to repeat.)

「Chapter Seventy-Nine: Resolving Great Grievances
Resolving great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances—
how can this be considered a good deed?

**Elucidations:**
Zhuangzi said: *"Those who seek vengeance do not break the *nuè* handle,*
*even if they harbor resentment, they do not blame the stray tiles.*
The *nuè* handle is a component of the *nuè* sword (a legendary weapon).
Though one might resent the stray tiles,
people do not blame them—
for they lack sentience.
Thus, the sage holds only the left contract,
and does not demand repayment from others.*

**Elucidations:**
From *The Book of Rites (Liji)*:
*"The one presenting millet holds the contract’s terms.*
(The meaning is complete; no need to repeat the full text.)

Therefore, those with **virtue** oversee contracts (*qì*), those without oversee the *chè* (lit. ‘piercing’).
The Dao of Heaven shows no favoritism—
it always aligns with those of **virtue**.

**Elucidations:**
(Like Guo Ju’s filial piety toward his mother—
the meaning is already complete; no need to repeat.)

**Chapter Eighty: The Small State with Few People**
The small state with few people...»

Let the state have tenfold and hundredfold implements yet not use them.
Let the people hold death in reverence, yet not flee their homes.

**Elucidations:**
As with the Three Migrations of Pan Geng—
Pan Geng, younger brother of Yang Jia,
from his ancestor Yi’s capital at Geng Yi by the River,
moved to Yin.
**Annotation:** *The Three Migrations of Pan Geng* (the *Rites of Zhou* states):
The upper section addressed the nobles,
the middle the common folk,
the lower the officials, clans, and surnames—
illustrating the benefits of relocation
and the perils of refusal.
After Pan Geng’s migration,
he settled his people in their new homes,
then ordered their ranks,
and soothed the myriad multitudes.

The Great King’s relocation beneath Ji Mountain
is already detailed in the *Sixteen Chapters of the Great State* (under the *Downflow* section),
so it need not be repeated.

**Elucidations:**
When the people scatter and dwell not in peace,
yet still return to labor and restore their homes—
even the aged and widowed
find their proper place.
Though there are boats and carriages,
none are mounted upon them.
Though there are armor and weapons,
none are arrayed in battle.
Let the people return to knotted cords for their use.

**Elucidations:**
*Carving wood into boats*
to cross the waters.
**Annotation:** *The Zhou易 (Easy)* (in its *Lower Appendices*) states:
*"Carving wood into boats, hewing wood into oars—*
the advantage of boats and oars
lies in ferrying what cannot pass
and reaching distant lands,
thus benefiting all under Heaven."
This is drawn from the *Yan* (泱) hexagram,
whose *Simile* (彖辞) reads:
*"Advantageous to cross great rivers—*
to ride upon wood is to achieve merit."*

**Elucidations:**
*Zhuangzi* says:
In the age of **ultimate virtue**,
mountains lack paths or tunnels,
marshes lack boats or bridges—
all things thrive in clusters,
bound to their native lands.
**Annotation:** *From Zhuangzi’s* **《Ma Ti (马蹄篇)》** *it reads:*
*"In the age of **ultimate virtue**,
their movement is **filling**—*
**filling** (填填) denotes contentment.
Their gaze is **precious**—*
**precious** (颠颠) means upright vision."*

At this time,
mountains had no paths or tunnels,
marshes had no boats or bridges—
all things flourished in clusters,
bound to their native lands,
birds and beasts gathered in herds,
grasses and trees grew in abundance.

Therefore, beasts could be tethered and led to roam,
and the nests of birds could be climbed to observe.

In the age of **ultimate virtue**,
people dwelled together with beasts,
and their clans mingled with all things—
how could they distinguish between the **noble** and the **petty**?

At this time,
the people were self-sufficient,
with no need for trade, commerce, or migration.
Thus, it is said:
*"Though there were boats and carriages,
there was nothing to ride upon."*

**Elucidations:**
*"Though there were strong armor and sharp weapons,
there was no occasion to display them."*

Quoted from *Mencius* **《Liang Hui Wang Zhang Ju Shang (梁惠王章句上)》**,
Mencius spoke to **King Hui of Liang** (梁惠王):
*"If you, O King, were to practice **benevolent governance** (仁政) among the people,
reduce punishments,
lighten taxes and levies,
and encourage deep plowing with frequent crop rotation—
then the strong would use their leisure days
to cultivate filial piety, fraternal respect, loyalty, and trustworthiness,
serving their fathers and elder brothers at home,
and their superiors abroad.
Thus, they could be made to wield their spears
and repel the **fierce armor and sharp weapons** of Qin and Chu."*

**Elucidations:**
*The Book of Changes* (《易》) system states:
*"In the upper antiquity, they governed by knotting cords.
Later sages replaced this with written contracts,
and the myriad officials governed with them,
while the common people discerned right from wrong.
This is drawn from the **Jue** (夬) hexagram,
which signifies **resolution** (决).
Five yang lines jointly resolve one yin line—
taking the meaning of decisive judgment."*

*"They found their food sweet,
their garments fine,
their dwellings secure,
and their customs joyful.
Neighboring countries were visible to one another,
and the sounds of roosters and dogs could be heard—
yet the people lived and died
without ever visiting one another."*

The **Elucidations** state:

*"Though their fare be coarse—vegetable gruel and hemp porridge—
what they eat is always sweet.
**Annotations:**
*Vegetable fare* is taken from *The Analects* (《论语》·述而篇), where Confucius says:
*'To eat coarse rice, drink water, bend one’s arm as a pillow—
joy lies therein.'*
*Unrighteous wealth is like floating clouds to me.*

*[Further], hemp porridge* is cited from *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》·让王篇):
*When Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai,
for seven days he ate no cooked food,
his hemp porridge unseasoned,
his complexion wan—
yet he played his lute and sang within his chamber.*
Here, the intent transcends mere sweetness of food;
it lies in the joy of the Dao itself.*

---

*"Though their garments be rough—hemp cloth and deer-fur pelts—
what they wear is always fine.
**Annotations:**
From *Liezi* (《列子》·天瑞篇):
*Confucius wandered on Mount Tai,
and saw Rong Qichang walking in the wilds of Yong,
clad in deer-fur, girded with a rope,
plucking his lute and singing.
Confucius asked: ‘Master, whence comes your joy?’
He replied: ‘My joys are manifold.
That I am born human—this is my first joy.
That I am male, honored above female—this is my second.
That I have lived to ninety—this is my third.
Poverty is the common lot; death, the end of all.
To dwell in the common and reach the end—what is there to fear?’
Confucius said: ‘Truly, one who knows how to ease himself!’
Thus, this is cited to prove the joy of deer-fur attire.*

---

*"Though their dwellings be humble—reed-thatched huts and wattle walls—
their homes are always secure.
**Annotations:**
*Reed-thatched huts and wattle walls* are taken from *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》·让王篇):
*Yuan Xian dwelt in Lu,
in a walled chamber of four paces,
thatched with living grass.
His wicker door was incomplete,
a willow branch its hinge.
His jar-windowed rooms,
patched with coarse cloth—
leaking above, damp below—
he sat cross-legged, plucking his strings.
Thus is proven the security of such humble dwellings.*

---

*"Though they endure the torments of southern heat and northern cold,
their abode is ever joyous.
**Annotations:**
*Southern heat and northern cold*—
The southernmost lands are lands of pure yang, scorched by fire-mountains,
where rats spin their fur into cloth, called *fire-washed silk*.
The northernmost lands are lands of pure yin, frozen by ice-mountains,
where silkworms dwell, known as *ice-silkworms*.
Though neither heat nor cold can harm them,
yet each abides in its place,
each fulfills its nature—
thus is proven the harmony of *dwelling in one’s place*.

---

*"By nature, their customs know no untimely death,
their land no pestilence.
**Annotations:**
From *Liezi* (《列子》·黄帝篇):
*The Listening-to-the-Maiden Mountain lies in the River-Sea Isles,
as recorded in *The Classic of Mountains and Seas*.
Upon it dwell divine beings.
They breathe the wind, drink the dew,
consume no five grains,
their hearts as deep as springs,
their forms as pure as maidens.
They neither cling nor love;
the sage and the immortal serve them.
They neither fear nor rage;
the spirits and demons obey them.
They neither bestow nor repay,
yet all is sufficient.
They neither hoard nor gather,
yet lack nothing.
*Shen* (蹇) means deficiency.
The harmony of yin and yang is constant,
the sun and moon ever bright,
the seasons ever true,
the winds and rains ever balanced,
the harvests ever bountiful.
Their land knows no injury,
their people no calamity,
their creatures no blemish,
their spirits no malevolence.*

---

*"Like fish that swim in rivers and lakes,
or men who forget each other in the Way.
**Annotations:**
From *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》·大宗师篇):
*When the spring dries up,
the fish gather on land,
blowing on one another to keep moist,
splashing each other with spittle—
yet this is not as good as forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes.*

*"In one village, only the Zhu and Chen clans,
intermarried through generations.
**Annotations:**
Bai Juyi composed a poem in praise of this.
*[Quoted from] ‘Trustworthy Words Are Not Beautiful’ (信言不美), Chapter Eighty.*

True words are not beautiful,
beautiful words are not true.
The virtuous do not argue,
those who argue are not virtuous.
The wise are not all-knowing,
the all-knowing are not wise.

**Extended Meaning:**
As the *Classic of Poetry* says:

the finest of tastes."*

the finest of sounds."*

Quoted from *Mao’s Commentary on the Odes* (《毛诗》·《小雅》·《巧言》):
*"The noble man makes many oaths,
yet disorder grows long.*
*The noble man trusts thieves,
yet disorder grows violent.*
*Thieving words are most sweet,
yet disorder grows gluttonous.*
*Not their steadfastness—
it is the king’s fault.*
*Tenderly nurtured, the willow grows,*
*the noble man plants it.*
*Coming and going, words are spoken,*
*yet the heart counts them.*
*Snake-like, grand words,*
*they issue from the mouth.*
*Crafty words flow like a reed-pipe,*
*their falsehood is thick."*

**Extended Meaning:**
Confucius said: *"Words, merely to convey meaning—
thus, no need for eloquence."*

nothing more.’*

*not to adorn with richness."*

**Extended Meaning:**
*"One thread runs through it all."*

Zhuangzi said: *"When ornamentation extinguishes substance,
and erudition drowns the heart,
thus it is said: ‘The all-knowing are not wise.’"*
Quoted from *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》·《缮性篇》):
*"Then they adorn it with ornament,
enrich it with erudition.
Ornamentation extinguishes substance,
erudition drowns the heart—
then the people begin to be confused and disordered,
unable to return to their true nature
and restore their original state.*
*The great principle speaks of how the world indulges in artificial pursuits,
using superficial elegance to obscure their innate simplicity.
With vast learning and broad reading,
they drown their pure and sincere hearts.
Thus they lose the Dao of effortless spontaneity.*
*Hence the Classic says: ‘The wise are not all-knowing,
the all-knowing are not wise.’*
*The Sage does not hoard.*
*Having given to others,
he grows ever more abundant.*
*Having given to others,
he grows ever more plentiful."*
