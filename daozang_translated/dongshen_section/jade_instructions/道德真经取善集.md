**Preface to *Taking the Good from the Dao De Jing***

When the Master Lao (老氏) was in the declining years of the Shang Dynasty, he pitied the corruption of the Way (道) and the moral decline of his age, attributing it to the excesses of culture. Thus, he sought to restore the simplicity of the ancient Dao, expounding the profound winds of mysticism to rouse the common folk—even to the point of scorn for virtue and morality, rejecting ritual and scholarship. Indeed, his words were so piercingly direct that they could not be bent by falsehood; hence, Confucius held him in reverence.

Upon seeing it, Confucius sighed, *"It is like a dragon!"*—only the sage knows the sage, and so he spoke.

Guan Yin (关尹) beheld the auspicious purple vapor and recognized the True Person (真人) crossing the pass. With devout sincerity, he knelt and pleaded for instruction, and only then did the Master descend his profound teachings.

Critics often say that the Five Classics (五经) are vast yet inferior to the two chapters of this text in brevity—truly, there is reason for this.

Zhuang Zhou (庄周) and Lie Yu (列御寇) expanded its teachings, as if stirring great waves in the boundless sea or raising towering peaks upon lofty mountains. Yet even this only approximates its edges without fully grasping its intent. Only when one forgets words does one truly recognize its guiding principles.

During the reigns of Emperor Wen (文) and Emperor Jing (景) of the Han Dynasty, governance favored simplicity and tranquility, and the empire flourished in peace. This was due to the guidance of Cao Can (曹参), who followed the teachings of Gao Gong (盖公), proving the efficacy of the Dao De’s virtue (德) in transforming the world—indeed, the Master’s lament was not in vain.

In the Jin Dynasty, however, the Dao degenerated into frivolous fancy. Wang Xuan (王衍) indulged in empty discourse, undermining the pure traditions. Ruan Ji (阮籍) raged recklessly, further destroying the foundations of moral order. To abandon the root and follow only the branches—how could one not grieve?

Fortunately, the Sui scholar Wang Zhongyan (王仲淹) deeply understood its nature, declaring that *"the Dao’s emptiness was prolonged, and the Jin Dynasty thus declined—not the fault of Laozi and Zhuangzi, but because their teachings were misapplied."*

In the Tang Dynasty, Han Yu (韩愈) still mocked its minimalism as *"petty virtue, like a frog in a well viewing the heavens."* Alas, Han Yu squandered his brilliance while ignorant of the Dao—he was deaf and blind in spirit, unable to perceive how the thunder of Tai Mountain (太山) could shake his ears and dazzle his sight.

To call this lack of wisdom, and to earn the sighs of the virtuous—how lamentable!

Devout adherents have never been lacking across generations, each interpreting the text according to their own understanding. Their commentaries number in the tens, making it difficult both to read and to compile.

Li Lin (李霖) of Rao Yang (饶阳), styled Zong Fu (宗傅), was by nature serene and unassuming, steadfast from youth to old age. He dedicated himself to studying the Five Thousand Characters (五千之文), embodying the resolve of *"knowing the lofty and noble as worthy of emulation, forgetting the labor of probing and analyzing."* He gathered the finest interpretations from various schools, blending them with his own insights, and produced six volumes.

Just as the Eight Tones (八音) differ yet harmonize to the ear, or the Five Flavors (五味) vary yet please the palate—so too does this work.

The purpose is to broaden understanding and enrich knowledge, thereby aiding fellow practitioners of the Way. Its contributions, though modest, are by no means insignificant.

Wang Bin was the Master’s old friend, and in admiration of his diligence and fulfillment of his aspirations, he commissioned artisans to engrave the text onto wooden blocks, sparing those who cherish the Way the labor of manual transcription. His thoughtful generosity can hardly be called anything but benevolent.

This was in the year *Dàdìng* *Rénchén* (大定壬辰), on the *Chóngwǔ* day (重午), prefaced by the River Interval Scholar Liu Yunsheng (河间刘允升).

All things derive from the Dao.
The Dao within us is virtue/power (*dé*).
The Dao is subtle and formless, its transformations unfathomable.
Virtue/power is manifest and substantial—yet all is virtue/power.
From its differences, it appears as two names.
From its unity, its essence remains singular.

The unlearned speak of the Dao yet often overlook virtue/power.
Those who speak of virtue/power invariably include the Dao.
Thus, the separation of Dao and virtue/power obscures their perfect unity.

Just as the Dragon, the Supreme Sage, lamented the decay of nature and life at the end of the Shang dynasty, and pitied the decline of Dao and virtue/power, he composed *Nine Times Nine* chapters to illuminate the most profound mysteries. His words did not exceed the *Five Thousand Characters*, yet their meaning permeated the Three Teachings. Internally, it teaches cultivation of the heart and nurturing of life; externally, it guides governance and the pacification of the people—being the foremost principle for all speech and the origin of all things. It encompasses the vast without omission, the minute without neglect. Its language is concise, its meaning profound—vast and boundless indeed.

Since the advent of written records, no text has surpassed this Scripture in its profundity. Though many have since commented upon it, few have grasped its entirety. Each interprets according to their own perspective, with inevitable gains and losses. Those who comprehend nature may attain the subtle mysteries of the Perfect Spirit, yet their understanding of life may remain incomplete. Those who master life may grasp the essential keys to longevity, yet their grasp of nature may be insufficient.

Yet truly, nature and life are inseparable—Dao and virtue/power are one.

From my youth to maturity, I recited the Mysterious Words in vain, awaiting the opportunity to answer inquiries. Now aged, I seek to delve into their deeper meanings to cultivate my own authenticity. Knowing my feeble understanding cannot fathom the Sage’s intent, I have gathered the finest interpretations of others and supplemented them with my own, not to enlighten later generations, but for the convenience of reference. I have titled it *The Gathering of the Virtuous* (*Qǔshànjí*), hoping readers will not scorn it.

*Collected Works of the Song Dynasty Rao Yang Recluse Li Lin*

**Imperial Annotation:**
The Dao is the path all share.
Virtue/power is what the heart attains on its own.
The Dao endures through all ages without decay.
Virtue/power fills the nature and remains ever-present.

Laozi, in the declining years of the Zhou, saw the Dao descend while virtue/power waned, and thus composed *Nine Times Nine* chapters to clarify the eternal principles of Dao and virtue/power, calling it the *Classic*. Its words are simple, its meaning profound—students must ponder it in silence and strive deeply to master it.

**Chapter One: The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of**

The Dao that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao.
The name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.

Yán Zhūn remarked: *"The Dao that can be spoken of is the manifest virtue/power, not the natural and spontaneous."*

Today’s practitioners do not carry torches by day because the sun shines naturally.
The natural brightness of the sun is the Eternal Dao.
Carrying torches is the manifest Dao.

What can be inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and passed down to others—this is the Dao that can be spoken of.
Yet there is also the Dao that can be transmitted but not received, obtained but not seen—its origin and root precede Heaven and Earth, existing since antiquity. It is the eternal Dao that gives birth to gods, spirits, Heaven, and Earth.

The profundity of the *Five Thousand Characters* is unfolded in these few words—truly, the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious, the Divine beyond the Divine.

Wang Yuanzé said: *"Names arise from reality. Reality has form and measure; once form and measure are established, decay follows inevitably. How then can it be eternal? Only by grasping this impermanence can one attain true permanence."*

The opening phrase introduces *Dao*—the Great Dao.
The subsequent phrase, *"the Dao that can be spoken of,"* refers to the Dao of speech.

The Great Dao is empty and tranquil; its principles are profound and unfathomable. It cannot be spoken of, only grasped in silent understanding. Thus, the mind is perplexed and unable to comprehend, the tongue falters and cannot articulate—it must be intuitively realized within the spirit’s depths.

Even the word *Dao* itself cannot be spoken.
If left unspoken, the common folk follow it without knowing.
Thus, the Sage, unable to bear silence, named it *Dao*.
Once named, speech and explanation arise, waxing and waning in succession—this is not the Eternal Dao.

What can be spoken of is all the Dao, yet it is not the Eternal Dao.
Only what cannot be spoken of can be eternal.

Now, Confucian virtues like *rén* (仁, benevolence), *yì* (义, righteousness), *lǐ* (礼, propriety), and *zhì* (智, wisdom) are the Dao that can be spoken of yet cannot be eternal.
Only when they cannot be spoken of—when *rén* is *rén*, *yì* is *yì*, *lǐ* is *lǐ*, and *zhì* is *zhì*—do they remain unchanging while the Dao endures. Thus, the eternal Dao that cannot be spoken of is the natural and spontaneous, responding to stimuli and transforming without end, interacting with all things exhaustively. It cannot be transmitted through words or sought through intellect—only by embodying the mysterious workings of nature, containing light and concealing radiance, doing nothing yet accomplishing all, silently attaining its utmost.

The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
The named is the mother of all things.

Wén Gōng remarked: *"Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms. Their origin must derive from the nameless, hence the beginning of Heaven and Earth is called *nameless*. All things are born through form, their birth depending on the named, hence the mother of all things is called *named*."*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"The nameless is the Dao, from which Heaven and Earth originate. Thus, it is called the *nameless*, the beginning of Heaven and Earth.*

*Before the beginning, there was the nameless and the unnamed.*
*The unnamed gave rise to the named.*

*Without the unnamed, even Oneness cannot be attained.*
*The named is the origin of Oneness.*

*With Oneness yet unformed, this is the beginning of Heaven and Earth."*

---

Once it is called **Oneness**, can one still attain the **nameless**?

This thing, obtained and thus born, is called **virtue/power**. Hence, what is called the **named** is the mother of all things.
And all things obtain **Oneness** to be born—this is the case.

The **nameless** is called **Dao/Way**. The **Dao/Way** is ever the **nameless**, giving rise to Heaven and Earth,
and thus is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—this is the **Dao/Way**’s marvelous essence.

The **named** is called Heaven and Earth. Heaven envelops, Earth sustains,
and only then do all things stand—hence it is the mother of all things,
this being the **Dao/Way**’s broad manifestation.

Heaven and Earth possess form and position—this is the **named**.
The mother of all things, Heaven and Earth containing **qi**,
nurtures and matures all things, as a mother rears her child.

To dwell in the **nameless** is to seek its marvelous essence.
To dwell in the **named** is to seek its broad manifestation.

Sū Zǐyóu remarked:
*"From the **nameless**, form arises as Heaven and Earth.
When Heaven and Earth are positioned, the **named** begins to stand.
From the **named**, dispersion gives birth to all things.
When all things are nurtured, the **named** is beyond measure.
Thus, the **nameless** is the **Dao/Way**’s substance,
while the **named** is the **Dao/Way**’s function."*

The Sage embodies the **Dao/Way** for the world’s use,
entering all things yet ever **nameless**,
to behold its marvelous essence.

The Sage embodies its utmost **namelessness** yet ever **named**,
to behold its broad manifestation.

If one acts only in its broad manifestation while ignorant of its marvelous essence,
then it is coarse and not divine.

If one lingers only in its marvelous essence while ignorant of its broad manifestation,
then it is refined yet not practical.

The text states:
*"When moved by things, this is the stirrings of nature.*
Nature’s stirrings are the **Dao/Way**’s movement away from **stillness**,
relying on ears and eyes for sight and sound,
wearing out the heart and mind through ceaseless thought and planning.

Without desire, one may dwell in **stillness** to observe the beginning of Heaven and Earth—
this is the marvelous essence.
Hence it is said:
*'To ever lack desire is to call it **small**.*
The marvelous essence is refined yet **small**.

With desire, one moves to observe the mother of all things—
this is the broad manifestation.
Hence it is said:
*'All things return to it yet none know its master—this is the **great**.*
The broad manifestation is expansive yet **great**.*

The person without desire may perceive the **Dao/Way**’s refined marvel.
The person with desire sees only its coarse broadness.

These two arise from the same source yet bear different names,
both called **Xuan/Mysterious**.
Wén Gōng remarked:
*"The **Mysterious** is neither **having** nor **non-having**,
the ultimate of refined subtlety.
The two refer to **having desire** and **lacking desire**.
They arise from the same source—
both spring from the human heart.
Yet they bear different names,
for their names vary.
Though their names differ, their substance never truly does.
Since their substance never truly differs,
then both **having desire** and **lacking desire** are called **Mysterious**.*

The **Mysterious** as color is black,
yet shares the same origin as red.
Heaven’s hue is **Mysterious**,
for yin and yang share the same origin.

Both are called **Mysterious**,
for the **Mysterious** can embrace both yin and yang.
The **Mysterious** beyond the **Mysterious**,
is the gateway to all marvels.

The *Commentary* states:
*"The *Suwen* says: The **Mysterious** gives birth to the divine.*
*The *Yijing* calls the marvelous yet **small** the **Mysterious**.*
The **Mysterious** is Heaven’s color,
yet the colors that arise from it never reveal the **Mysterious** itself.
The **Mysterious** beyond the **Mysterious** is what is meant by 'colors that arise from it.'
The **Mysterious**’s refined principle permeates all things,
Heaven’s movement, Earth’s resting,
the human spirit’s vitality, and the flourishing of all creatures—
all are marvels,
yet all emerge from the **Mysterious**.
Thus it is called the **gateway to all marvels**.*

*The *Yijing* says:*
*'The interplay of one yin and one yang is called the **Dao/Way**,
and yin and yang both originate from Oneness.*
Oneness is what the **Dao/Way** gives rise to.
The **Mysterious** is where yin and yang share the same origin,
and the **Mysterious** is also the **Dao/Way** itself.
All marvels are the marvels of all things,
and all things possess marvelous principles,
yet all emerge from the **Dao/Way**—
thus it is called the **gateway to all marvels**.*

This chapter speaks of the **Dao/Way** of **True Constancy**.
Those who awaken shall find it themselves,
ineffable and beyond naming.
To harmonize the observation of broadness and marvel,
one may then construct the **Dao/Way** of **True Constancy**.

The **Supreme Sovereign** begins with this chapter,
summarizing the entire scripture’s intent,
illuminating the **Dao/Way**’s foundation—
this is the **Mysterious** beyond the **Mysterious**.

**Chapter Two: "All Under Heaven Know"**

All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—then ugliness arises.
All know goodness as goodness—then non-goodness arises.

The *Commentary* states:
*"The **Dao/Way** has no varied appearances—who then is beauty or ugliness?
Nature is inherently unified—who then is good or not?
There is beauty, and ugliness is its counterpart.
Hence it is said:
*'All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—then ugliness arises.'*
There is goodness, and non-goodness is its counterpart.
Hence it is said:
*'All know goodness as goodness—then non-goodness arises.'*

What the world esteems as beauty is the divine and strange.
What it abhors is the foul and rotten.
The divine and strange transform into the foul and rotten,
the foul and rotten transform into the divine and strange—
then what is the distinction between beauty and ugliness?

What was once affirmed may now be denied,
what was once rejected may later be employed."*

Then what is the distinction between virtue/power and non-virtue/non-power?

The Sage embodies the unchanging truth while always manifesting,
and transcends wondrous application while remaining non-attached—
beauty, ugliness, virtue/power, non-virtue/non-power,
all are but simplified illusions, beyond comprehension.
Why then should non-virtue/non-power be a burden?

Master Wang Yuanze said:
*"Non-virtue/non-power and non-goodness are the companions of virtue/power and goodness.
When virtue/power and goodness are in play,
non-virtue/non-power and non-goodness are already present.
To await their emergence and then realize it—
that is but late enlightenment.
Beauty and ugliness arise from deluded emotions,
virtue/power and non-virtue/non-power balance in the loss of true nature.
The beautiful is what human emotions cherish.
If one knows beauty as beauty,
then the mind has something it cherishes as beautiful.
When the mind cherishes beauty,
it brings affliction to itself—then ugliness arises.
If the River Spirit (河伯) rejoices exultantly,
boasting that all the beauty of the world lies within him,
he cannot escape sighing at the vastness before him,
almost falling into error.
The virtuous is what humans desire.
If one knows virtue/power as virtue/power,
then true nature has something it desires.
When true nature desires,
it strays from the Dao/Way to cling to virtue/power—then non-virtue/non-power arises.
If Master Bi (伯夷) saw the name of virtue/power as desirable,
starving beneath Chief Yang (首阳),
it was still a loss of true nature—almost falling into error.
For the Dao/Way’s beauty is the supreme beauty.
Supreme beauty transcends beauty, serene beyond all taste.
Zhuangzi said:
*'Faintly discerned, without limit—
all beauties arise from it.*
The Dao/Way’s virtue/power is the highest virtue/power.
Highest virtue/power forgets virtue/power,
and all virtues/powers are complete.
He also said:
*'Abandon virtue/power, and virtue/power itself is fulfilled.'*
This chapter unifies the Dao/Way as one,
fearing that people will cling to beauty and virtue/power,
and not awaken to the true and constant.
Thus it follows with this passage,
resembling *Zhuangzi’s齐物论* ["Discourse on Equalizing Things"].

The interplay of presence and absence,
difficulty and ease,
length and shortness,
height and depth,
sound and resonance,
before and after—
these six pairs arise from the interplay of transformation (韦变),
from myriad contemplations,
from divergent paths,
and are the means by which the world’s people
are ensnared and cannot extricate themselves.
Absence generates presence without movement,
presence returns to absence—
hence it is said: *presence and absence intergenerate.*
When presence encounters difficulty,
one knows ease in action—
hence it is said: *difficulty and ease intercomplete.*
Length and shortness define each other,
as with the ruler’s measurements.
Height and depth incline toward one another,
as with mountains and valleys.
A sound ascends and its echo responds—
hence it is said: *sound and resonance harmonize.*
A form moves and its shadow follows—
hence it is said: *before and after interfollow.*
The circulation of yin and yang,
the progression of the four seasons,
the principles of all things—
suddenly formed, then suddenly vanished.
Their difficulty is like the labor of contrivance (有为) in governing the world,
their ease is like the effortlessness of non-action (无为) in aligning with oneself.
What is long in nature is not to be severed,
what is short in nature is not to be prolonged.
Heaven’s own height, Earth’s own depth,
striking the gong of the palace (宫) and the palace resounds,
striking the gong of the ram’s horn (角) and the ram’s horn answers.
Spring precedes and summer follows,
the long precedes and the young follow—
though all these paired realms dwell within the Dao/Way,
they are far from its essence.
Master Wen (温公) said:
*'Whatever has form and trace
must not be equalized.
Unequalized, it leads to contention;
contention, to chaos;
chaos, to exhaustion—
thus the Sage does not value it.'*
Therefore, the Sage dwells in non-action (无为) in his deeds,
and practices the teaching of non-speech (不言).
Master Gu (顾欢) said:
*'The Sage follows Heaven and entrusts to things,
creating nothing.
His mind ever steadfast,
quiet before all.
When beauty and virtue/power are at rest,
there is no contention—
thus he is not swayed by the six realms.
Action brings gain and loss,
speech brings right and wrong—
one cannot escape burdens.
Therefore, the Sage in his affairs
acts through non-action and teaches through non-speech,
so that his heart remains serene,
never burdened by words,
and the world returns to its constant,
recovering its simplicity.
Only when there are no burdens,
does he, though dwelling between yin and yang,
transcend the power of creation,
and those six pairs—
how could they disturb him?*

The *Classic* says:
*"The teaching of non-speech,
the benefit of non-action—
few under Heaven attain to them."*
All things act without refusal—
the *Commentary* states:
*"All things move and respond,
sensing while reacting.
Like a mirror reflecting forms,
fair and foul appear without hesitation.
Like a valley echoing sounds,
beauty and ugliness all respond—
nothing is refused.
Now, though the count of things
does not stop at ten thousand,
it is called ‘all things’ to signify their multitude.
‘Act’ means to move and respond.
All things move and respond,
the Sage lets each fulfill its nature,
never refusing or obstructing,
for my heart is empty,
neither taking nor discarding.
If one harbors thoughts of taking or discarding,
then the myriad forms of things—
beauty, ugliness, and more—
how could one not refuse them?"*

To give birth without possession,
to act without reliance,
to complete the work without claiming it—
Master Zuan Wei (纂微) said:
*"All things generate themselves,
each standing alone in transformation,
not possessed by me.
The myriad qualities strive in their own doing,
each aligning with its own nature,
not relying on my virtue/power.
When deeds are completed and affairs fulfilled,
the Dao/Way harmonizes with things,
the heart wanders at Mount Gu Shou (姑射),
not dwelling over the ten thousand people—
this is the Sage’s complete virtue/power.
All things generate themselves,
each reaching their utmost height and grandeur.
All things act of their own accord,
each rectifying their own life and fate.
The Sage attributes function to things,
not burdening himself with the three affairs—
hence it is said:
*'To complete the work without claiming it—
if there is a self, then it claims.
Claiming, it strays.'*
Emperor Yao (帝尧) completed his work,
yet saw himself as deficient.
Only when one does not claim,
does one not stray.
Master Su Ziyou (苏子由) said:
*"The Sage dwells in poverty and humble station
yet feels no poverty or humble station’s distress,
dwells in wealth and honor
yet feels no wealth or honor’s burden—
this is called ‘not claiming.’
If I do not claim,
how could others follow to claim?*
This is the ultimate claiming."*

《鸿烈》 says: When the Chu general **Zi Fa** (子发) attacked the state of **Cai** (蔡) and crossed its borders, King **Xuan of Chu** (宣王) went to the outskirts to welcome him, granting him a hundred *mu* (亩) of land and the **jue** (圭) of a noble rank. Zi Fa declined the honor, saying:

*"To govern a state and establish policies—
this is the virtue/power of a sovereign.
To issue commands and have armies united—
this is the prestige of a general.
To fight battles and conquer the enemy—
this is the strength of commoners.
If I take credit for the people’s labor
and accept their rewards and honors,
this would not be the Dao/Way of benevolence and righteousness.
Therefore, I do not accept."*

Hence it is said:
*'To complete the work without claiming it—
if there is a self, then it claims.
Claiming, it strays.'*
Only when one does not claim,
does one not stray.

This chapter seeks to embody the **Zhenchang Dao** (真常之道),
forgetting distinctions of good and evil,
equating virtue and vice,
and not being swayed by the six pairs of opposites.
Only the Sage understands this truth.

Thus, in conducting affairs, he acts with **wuwei** (无为),
in teaching, he does not speak explicitly,
and he attributes function to things without claiming it—
the Dao/Way abides within me yet does not stray.

**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Virtuous**

*"Not exalting the virtuous*
makes the people not contend."

**Master Wen** (温公) said:
*"That the virtuous cannot be neglected—
all people know this.
But when its excesses become corrupt,
it leads to constant strife over reputation.
Thus, **Laozi** (老子) corrected this,
urging people to value substance, not name.
The virtuous are those
who stand out among the crowd.
When rulers distinguish and exalt them,
elevating them with noble ranks
and honoring them with fine carriages and robes,
the people then vie for external glory,
aspire to emulation,
and pursue fame without end—
how could contention cease?"*

The Sage has never truly failed to use the virtuous.
He simply assigns them to their proper roles
and entrusts them with their duties—
only he does not exalt them.

**Zhuangzi** (庄子) said:
*"To exalt the virtuous
makes the people jostle one another.
To prize rare goods
makes the people not steal."*

**御注** explains:
*"Exalting the virtuous leads to widespread knowledge,
until the world is in uproar—
Confucianism and Mohism arise.
Prize rare goods, and the people’s desires multiply,
until daylight theft becomes rampant—
as seen in the saying, 'Midday burglary at the Lu holes.' (中穴陆)"*

**御注** further states:
*"The people’s desires,
when unchecked, override their natural inclinations,
leading to plunder, deception, and shamelessness—
there is no end to their excesses.
When **Yi** (夷) sees the allure of fame,
he starves beneath Shouyang’s slopes.
When **Zhi** (跖) sees the lure of profit,
he dies violently at Dongling’s heights.
Their passions burn like wildfire,
their coldness freezes like ice—
thus, their hearts are filled with fury, disorder, and arrogance,
and cannot be bound to the Dao/Way.
But the Sage
does not pursue profit,
does not shun harm,
does not rejoice in longevity,
does not lament fate,
does not glory in fame,
does not despise poverty—
then what is there to desire?
If desires do not arise,
my heart is clear and still,
responding only to what is felt—
when motion ceases, there is no obstruction,
when action begins, there is no compulsion—
who could disturb it?"*

The **junzi** (君子) desires only the virtuous.
The **xiaoren** (小人) is drawn to wealth.
Since there are no traces of exalting the virtuous
and no pursuit of rare goods,
there are no visible desires—
thus, the people’s hearts remain undisturbed.

**Fu Yi** (傅奕) in his *Yinyi* (音义) says:
*"The ancient text reads: 'makes the people’s hearts not be disturbed.' (民心不乱)"*

Therefore, the Sage’s governance
**He Shang Gong** (河上公) says:
*"The Sage’s rule over a state
is the same as his cultivation of the self."*

—empties the heart, fills the belly,
**Cao Daochong** (曹道冲) says:
*"An empty heart, white and clear,
retains the spirit and preserves the Dao/Way.
A filled belly,
ensures full vital essence and long life."*

—selects nothing, empties the heart so there is no virtue to exalt,
—contains all, fills the belly so there is no desire to covet.

—weakens the will, strengthens the bones.
**御注** explains:
*"A strong will leads some to pursue fame without rest,
others to chase wealth without satisfaction,
others to boast of their achievements,
or to pride themselves on their abilities—
the farther they stray from the Dao/Way.
The Sage’s will
ever humbles itself, yet others hold it high.
Ever lags behind, yet others place it first.
Knowing its strength, he guards its weakness;
knowing its glory, he guards its shame—
this is called 'weakening the will.'
As for 'strengthening the bones,'
if one does not harm them,
as seen in **Guangchengzi** (广成子) living a thousand two hundred years
without ever showing signs of decay—
this is called 'strengthening the bones.'"*

**Liu Zhongping** (刘仲平) says:
*"An empty heart and weakened will
nourish the spirit.
A filled belly and strong bones
preserve vital essence.
The will is where the heart directs—
guarding the Dao/Way weakens the will.
The bones are the repository of marrow—
when marrow is full, the bones are strong.
Another interpretation:
An empty heart leads to a weakened will,
a filled belly leads to strong bones.
Or:
An empty heart leads to a weakened will,
a filled belly leads to strong bones—
these are both plausible readings."*

The Sage’s governance
always makes the people **without knowledge and without desire**.

**御注** explains:
*"Zhuangzi said:
*'In harmony with the unknowing,
its virtue/power does not depart.
In harmony with the undesiring,
this is called "primordial simplicity." (素朴)
Primordial simplicity—
and the people’s nature is preserved.'*
The Sage’s governance
strives only to let the people realize their nature.
Excessive knowledge disrupts their natural roles,
excessive desire drowns their natural inclinations—
though it may be called 'governance,'
what chaos could be greater?"*

Thus, the Sage’s governance
always makes the people **without knowledge and without desire**.

**Wang Yuanzai** (王元泽) says:
*"Knowledge leads to false perceptions,
desire leads to external seeking—
when these two are removed,
nature and emotion are settled.
From not exalting the virtuous,
he empties the heart and weakens the will to transform them,
making the people lack contentious knowledge of the virtuous.
From not prizing rare goods,
he fills the belly and strengthens the bones to transform them,
making the people lack acquisitive desire for wealth."*

「Thus, the Sage’s governance ensures that the wise dare not act.
**Lǚ Jìfǔ** (吕吉甫) says:
*"The wise know that the virtuous are not prized by the Sage,
and that wealth is not valued by the Sage,
yet to act upon such knowledge is not beneficial—
hence, they dare not act."*

**To act without acting** (為無為),
then there is nothing left untamed.
**Shū Wáng** (舒王) says:
*"To act without purpose is to act without restraint;
to act without restraint is to act without ceasing.
The Sage acts without acting,
and thus there is nothing left untamed."*

This chapter speaks of the Sage embodying the **Dao/Way** of **wuwei** (無為) to govern.
**Not prizing the virtuous, not valuing wealth,**
emptying the heart and filling the belly,
weakening the will and strengthening the bones—
this is the Sage embodying the **Dao/Way** to govern the body **without acting**.

**To make the people not contend** and align with **wu zhi** (無知),
**to make the people not steal** and align with **wu yu** (無欲),
then there is nothing left untamed.

The *Classic* (《經》) says:
**"The Dao/Way is ever without acting yet nothing remains unacted upon.**
If lords and kings could guard it,
all things would naturally transform themselves.
The Sage who governs **without acting** is how **Yú Shùn** (虞舜) became Emperor.
The Sage who governs with **垂拱** (垂拱) is how **Zhōu Wǔ** (周武) became King.
Thus it is said:
**Emperors and Kings govern without acting, and the realm is perfected.**

**Chapter Four: The Dao/Way is Boundless** (道沖)
The Dao/Way is boundless,
yet its use may appear as though it were not full.

**御注** (Commentary):
*"The Dao/Way has sentiment and trust,
hence it has use.
Without acting and without form,
hence it is not full.
Boundless (沖) means central (中).*
The Dao/Way’s use,
though it suppresses the high and elevates the low,
reduces excess and supplements deficiency,
has no fixed course yet finds its center.
The Dao/Way’s essence,
empty yet not full,
overflowing yet without limit,
nourishes all things yet never possesses—
hence it is said to appear as though it were not full.

**Abyssal (渊)**, it seems like the origin of all things.
**Wēn Gōng** (温公) says:
*"Deep and unfathomable,
ever the master of all things.
Abyssal (渊) and flowing (反流) are one.*
The *Shuō Wén* (《说文》) says:
*"Returning water (回水).*
When water returns, it is deep and still;
when it returns and becomes an abyss (渊),
it ceases to flow—
thus, its unity is complete."

**兮** (Ah) is a rhythmic aid in singing.
**Zhuāngzǐ** (庄子) says:
*"The stillness of water is its abyss (渊).*
The abyss is deep and still,
unmixed with things—
the essence of the Dao/Way.
Only its depth—
no thing can fathom it.
Only its stillness—
no thing can move it.
The Dao/Way’s essence is abyssal (渊), deep and still,
appearing as the origin of all things.
Yet the Dao/Way itself has no inherent connection to things;
it is the origin of itself alone—
hence it is said to appear so.*

As for those who say "appears" (似),
it is because they dare not speak directly of it.

**Humans are originally sufficient within this Dao/Way;**
those who seek to embody it
must not seek it elsewhere.
They should blunt their sharpness,
resolve their entanglements,
harmonize their brilliance,
and align with the dust—
then they will naturally preserve themselves.

**Blunt their sharpness, resolve their entanglements,**
harmonize their brilliance,
and align with the dust.
**Wēn Gōng** (温公) says:
*"The sharpness of edges and the fierceness of exposure—
these are what the Dao/Way abhors.
Troublesome and chaotic affairs—
these are what the Dao/Way despises.
Dazzling radiance and ostentatious display—
these are the Dao/Way’s ruin.
Humility and obscurity—
these are what the Dao/Way values.*

When the heart strays outward and mingles with things,
that is sharpness—
blunt it and do not act.
When things arrive and the heart becomes entangled,
that is entanglement—
resolve it and do not be disordered.
To blunt sharpness and resolve entanglements,
the nature and emotions settle,
and naturally become full and radiant.

Once radiance is present,
it is not fundamentally different from things—
harmonized and aligned yet not displayed,
this is called **light yet not blinding** (光而不耀).
Within, it does not lose its truth;
without, it does not differ from the common—
aligned with the dust yet unstained,
this is called **committing with things and aligning with their waves** (與物委蛇，而同其波).

**Serene (湛)**, it seems as though it might be preserved.
**Guō Xiàng** (郭象) says:
*"Preserved (存) means 'to exist.'
The Dao/Way is serene and tranquil,
unchanging from ancient to present,
constant from beginning to end—
hence it is said to exist.
Yet it exists without things—
hence it is said to appear so.*

If humans can follow these four principles,
then they will be serene and ever still—
preserved.
To preserve yet be fixed is not the Dao/Way.
The saying "appears as though it might be preserved" (似或者不可定有之謂)
refers to this.

I do not know whose child it is.
**Wáng Yuànzǎi** (王元泽) says:
*"It is the embodiment of the Dao/Way as spoken of today.
Though it has an origin, it is vast and without form—
hence it is said: I do not know whose child it is.*
The phrase "whose child" (誰之子)
asks from whom this Dao/Way originates.

**The Form of the Emperor precedes the Dao/Way.**
**御注** (Commentary):
*"Form (象) is the initial appearance of things.
The Emperor (帝) is the manifestation of the divine responding to things.*
Things arise and then form appears;
the Emperor emerges and then wondrous things are manifest.
The Form of the Emperor (象帝),
though it marks the beginning of things,
is preceded by the Dao/Way itself.
This is what **Zhuāngzǐ** (庄子) meant by
**'the divine and the ghostly, the divine and the Emperor,**
**generating heaven and earth.'**
The Form of the Emperor (象帝) portends the beginning of things,
and the Emperor (帝) is the sovereign of all things.
The Form of the Emperor (象帝) is most profound,
yet the Dao/Way surpasses it even further.
This chapter speaks of the Dao/Way using centrality (中) as its function,
its essence empty yet not full,
the master of all existence,
preceding the Form of the Emperor (象帝).

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth**
Heaven and Earth are not **virtuous** (仁),
treating all things as **straw dogs** (刍狗).
The Sage is not **virtuous** (仁),
treating the people as **straw dogs** (刍狗).

**御注** (Commentary):
*"Kindness arises from harm,
harm arises from kindness.
If kindness is taken as kindness,
harm will inevitably follow.
Heaven and Earth toward all things,
the Sage toward the people,
aid their natural tendencies,
without a heart of love or benefit.
Kindness cannot be named with certainty."*

**Straw dogs** (刍狗) are made by bundling straw,
used in sacrifices to **Qí** (杞).
When the ritual is appropriate, they are used;
when it is over, they are discarded.
As for the spontaneous generation of all things,
the self-governance of the people—
how could they be contained by the heart?»

「爱人利物之谓仁。不仁者，谓无情於弁爱，非薄恶之谓也。
*The Way of loving people and benefiting all things is called **virtue** (仁).
The unvirtuous (不仁) is said to lack emotional attachment in aiding others—
not the meaning of being indifferent or cruel.*

天地生化万物，任其自然，无爱利之心焉。如刍狗当祭祀之用也。
Heaven and Earth give birth and transform all things,
letting them follow their natural course,
without a heart of love or benefit.
Like **straw dogs** (刍狗) used in ritual sacrifices.

盛以箧衍，巾以文绣，尸祝斋戒，然后用之。及祭之后，行者践其首脊，樵者焚其支体，
They are adorned with embroidered cases and silken cloth,
and the officiating priest, after fasting and purification,
then employs them.
After the sacrifice, travelers trample their heads and backs,
woodcutters burn their limbs—
the things are discarded not out of hatred or affection,
but simply because their use has passed.

且天地之於万物，圣人之於百姓，亦然。
Moreover, Heaven and Earth’s relation to all things,
and the Sage’s relation to the people,
is the same.

故天地无恩而大恩生，圣人不仁而大仁成。
Thus, Heaven and Earth, though without **virtue** (恩),
give rise to great **virtue** (恩).
The Sage, though not **virtue** (仁),
accomplishes great **virtue** (仁).

天地之间其犹弃钥乎。
Between Heaven and Earth, it is like the blowing of a **bellows** (橐) or the playing of a **flute** (钥).

唐明皇曰：橐者，韛也。钥者，笛也。
Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang said:
*"The **bellows** (橐) is the **pouch** (韛).
The **flute** (钥) is the **pipe** (笛).*

橐之鼓风，钥之运吹，皆以虚而无心，故能动而有应。
The bellows’ wind-stirring, the flute’s breath-playing,
both rely on emptiness and lack a heart—
thus they move and have response.

王元泽曰：橐钥虚以应物，物感则应，应而不藏。
Wang Yuanze said:
*"The bellows and flute are empty yet responsive to things;
when things are moved, they respond—
but they do not store the response."*

天地之於万物，圣人之於百姓，应其适然，而不系累於当时，不留情於既往，
Heaven and Earth respond to all things in their due measure,
without entangling themselves in the present moment,
without lingering emotionally in the past—

故比橐钥之无穷也。
thus likened to the boundless **bellows** (橐) and **flute** (钥).

道无方体，以冲和之气鼓动於覆载之问，而生养万物。
The Dao/Way has no fixed form—
with its **unbounded and harmonious qi** (冲和之气),
it stirs between the heavens and the earth,
giving birth and nurturing all things.

如橐以气化形，钥以气出声，
Like the bellows transforming qi into form,
or the flute letting qi issue forth as sound—
qi is empty yet awaits things,
and all that has form and sound
arises from this.
Thus likened to the **bellows** (橐) and **flute** (钥).

以喻天地圣人，亦以虚而无心故也。
This is to illustrate Heaven, Earth, and the Sage—
all because of their emptiness and lack of a fixed heart.

虚而不屈，动而愈出。
Empty yet never rigid,
moving yet ever more issuing forth.

王弼曰：橐钥之中空洞，无情无为，故虚而不能穷屈，动而不可竭尽也。
Wang Bi said:
*"The bellows and flute are hollow within,
without emotions or actions,
thus empty yet never exhausted—
moving yet never spent."*

王元泽曰：虚其体也，动其用也。多言数穷，不如守中。
Wang Yuanze said:
*"Empty in essence, active in function.
Excessive speech leads to depletion—
better to hold to the center."*

御注：慎汝内，闭汝外，收视反听，复以见天地之心，此之谓守中。
**Commentary**:
*"Be cautious within, close off without,
retract your gaze and reverse your hearing—
thus you may perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth.
This is called holding to the center."*

王弼曰：若不法天地之虚静，同橐钥之无心，动不从感，言不会机，
Wang Bi said:
*"If you do not follow Heaven and Earth’s **emptiness and tranquility** (虚静),
or align with the **bellows** (橐) and **flute** (钥)’s lack of a heart,
your movements do not arise from response,
your words do not accord with the Dao—

动与事乖，故曰数穷。
moving and affairs are mismatched—
thus it is said that depletion comes from excessive speech.

不如内怀道德，抱一不移，故曰守中。
Better to inwardly cherish **Dao/Way and virtue** (道德),
embracing the One without deviation—
thus it is called holding to the center."*

此章戒人多言，不如守内。
This passage warns against excessive speech—
better to hold within.

始言天地不仁，中以橐钥为况，终之以多言数穷者，
It begins by saying Heaven and Earth are not **virtue** (仁),
uses the **bellows** (橐) and **flute** (钥) as analogy in the middle,
and concludes with the warning that excessive speech leads to depletion—

欲人之出言，法天地之无心，如橐钥之虚中，
wishing that when people speak,
they follow Heaven and Earth’s lack of a fixed heart,
like the **bellows** (橐) and **flute** (钥)’s empty center—

因感而应，则无多言之失。
responding naturally to stimuli,
then there will be no fault of excessive speech.

与其言多而政祸，不如默默而守中。
Better to speak little and avoid misgovernance
than to speak much and invite calamity.

谷神章第六
谷神不死，

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit (谷神)**
The Valley Spirit does not die.

御注：有形则有盛衰，有数则有成败，形数具而生死分，物之理也。
**Commentary**:
*"Where there is form, there is flourishing and decline.
Where there is number, there is success and failure.
When form and number are complete, life and death are distinguished—
this is the nature of things."*

谷应群动而常虚，神妙万物而常寂，
The Valley responds to all movements yet remains ever empty,
the Spirit subtly transforms all things yet remains ever still—

真常之中，与道为一，不丽於形，不堕於数，
Within the **true and enduring** (真常),
it aligns with the Dao/Way as One,
not clinging to form,
not entangled in number—

生生而不穷。
endlessly giving birth.

如日月焉，终古不息。如维斗焉，终古不忒。
Like the sun and moon,
they never cease through all ages.
Like the **Pole Star** (维斗),
they never deviate through all ages.

故云不死。
Thus it is said that the Valley Spirit does not die.

河上公曰：谷，养也。人能养神则不死。
River Master Hu said:
*"The Valley (谷) is nurturing.
If a person can nurture the Spirit (神), then they do not die."*

神谓五脏之神，肝藏魂，肺藏魄，心藏神，肾藏精，脾藏志。
The Spirit (神) refers to the **vital essences of the Five Zang Organs** (五脏之神):
the liver stores the **hun** (魂),
the lungs store the **po** (魄),
the heart stores the **shen** (神),
the kidneys store the **jing** (精),
the spleen stores the **zhi** (志).

五脏尽伤，五神去矣。
When the Five Zang Organs are all injured,
the Five Spirits depart.

温公曰：中虚故曰谷。不测故曰神。
Duke Wen said:
*"Empty within, hence it is called the Valley (谷).
Unfathomable, hence it is called the Spirit (神).*

天地有穷而道无穷，故曰不死。
Heaven and Earth have limits,
but the Dao/Way is boundless—
thus it is said that the Valley Spirit does not die."*

王元泽曰：谷应而不穷，神化而不测，
Wang Yuanze said:
*"The Valley responds yet never exhausts,
the Spirit transforms yet remains unfathomable—
all things receive their mandate from it,
yet it has never been born or died.
This is the Valley Spirit.*

言神则极矣，而加谷者，
To speak of the Spirit is already to reach the utmost—
yet the Valley is added—

且言能虚能盈，而又能容以应也。
because it also speaks of the ability to be empty and full,
and to contain and respond.

以其活而不敌，故但称不死。
Since it is alive yet never opposed,
it is simply called the Way of not dying.

是谓玄牝。
This is called the **Dark Mother** (玄牝)."

御注：万物受命於无，而成形於有谷之用。
**Commentary**:
*"All things receive their mandate from the **None** (无),
and take form through the **Valley’s** (谷) nurturing function.*

无相，神之体；无方，万物所受命也。
The **None** (无) has no attributes—
this is the essence of the Spirit.
It has no direction—
this is where all things receive their mandate.

玄者天之色。牝者地之类。
The **Dark** (玄) is the hue of Heaven.
The **Mother** (牝) is the category of Earth.

万物所成形也，
All things take form from this—

谷神以况至道之常，玄牝以明造物之妙。
the Valley Spirit illustrates the Dao’s enduring nature,
while the Dark Mother reveals the marvel of creation."

王元泽曰：谷神受命而玄牝赋形，
Wang Yuanze said:
*"The Valley Spirit receives the mandate and the Dark Mother bestows form—
they themselves constitute **yin** (阴) and **yang** (阳),
thus completing Heaven and Earth.
Yet they are originally one thing.*

由其受命，故曰谷神。
Because of their receiving the mandate,
they are called the Valley Spirit.

由其赋形，故曰玄牝。
Because of their bestowing form,
they are called the Dark Mother."

曹道冲曰：玄者杳冥而藏神。牝者冲和而藏气。
Cao Daichong said:
*"The **Dark** (玄) is profound and mysterious yet stores the Spirit.
The **Mother** (牝) is **unbounded and harmonious** (冲和) yet stores the qi.
This is the origin of **yin** (阴) and **yang** (阳),
the ancestor of Heaven and Earth."*

谷，养也。谷虚而应，应而不着。谷虚而受，受而不积。
The Valley is nurturing.
Empty yet responsive,
responding yet not clinging.
Empty yet receptive,
receiving yet not accumulating.

言养神在於虚而已，
To nurture the Spirit is only to remain empty—

是谓不死之道，在於玄牝也。
this is called the Way of not dying,
found in the Dark Mother.

玄牝之门，是谓天地根。
The **gate of the Dark Mother** (玄牝之门) is called the **root of Heaven and Earth** (天地根).

御注：庄子曰：万物有乎生而莫见其根，有乎出而莫见其门。
**Commentary**:
*"Zhuangzi said:
‘All things have a place of birth yet no one sees their root;
they have a place of emergence yet no one sees their gate.
Only the Sage can see them.’*

故於此明言玄牝之门，是谓天地根。
Thus here it is made clear:
the **gate of the Dark Mother** (玄牝之门)
is the **root of Heaven and Earth** (天地根).

天地者，万物之上下也。物与天地，本无先后，
Heaven and Earth are the **up** and **down** of all things.
Things and Heaven and Earth originally have no precedence—

明大道之序，则有天地，然后有万物。
but when the Dao’s order is illuminated,
there are Heaven and Earth,
and then all things.

然天地之所从出者，玄牝是已。
Yet the origin from which Heaven and Earth emerge
is the Dark Mother.

彼先天地生者，孰得而见之。
Who can see the one that gave birth before Heaven and Earth?

河上公曰：根，元也。言鼻。
River Master Hu said:
*"The **root** (根) is the **primordial** (元)—
it refers to the **nostril** (鼻).*

之门，乃是通天地之元，气所从往来也."
The **gate** (之门) is where the primordial essence of Heaven and Earth passes—
the path through which the qi travels back and forth."*

---

Zhuǎn Wēi said:
*"Above, it speaks of the **immortal elixir of the Valley Spirit** (谷神不死),
urging people to nurture the spirit.
Here, it speaks of the **gate of the Dark Mother** (玄牝之门),
demonstrating the **art of refining the form** (炼形之术) to people.
Thus, when spirit and form are both perfected,
only then does one align with the Dao."*

Cáo Dàochōng said:
*"The **Dark** (玄) is the **substance of Heaven** (天之体).
The **Mother** (牝) is the **qi of Earth** (地之气).
The Dark Heaven’s **originative essence** (精光) gives rise to life—
the Dark Mother’s **nourishment** (育) brings forth all things as **form and vessel** (形器).
Though Heaven and Earth are vast,
they fundamentally stem from **virtue and power** (道德),
and manifest through **yin and yang** (阴阳),
hence the saying: **root of Heaven and Earth** (天地根).*

*"Endless as if it exists,
River Master Hu said: **the nostril** (鼻).
Inhaling and exhaling, breathing and sighing—
constantly subtle and endless.
If one can preserve it,
it is as if it has no form.
As if it does not exist.
Wang Yuanzé said:
*'**Endless** (绵绵) means drawing without ceasing.
The **Dark Mother** (神牝) endlessly gives birth—
yet it is as if it has or does not have,
defying fixed existence.
Using it without exhaustion—
The **Imperial Commentary** (御注) says:
*'From its own root and origin,
fixed since antiquity,
the transmission of the **Fire** (火) knows no end.
This is what is meant by **endless as if it exists** (绵绵若存).*
It is **vastly natural** (茫然天造),
letting the **single breath** (一气) move freely.
Swiftly, **Earth’s transformation** (地化) unfolds,
entrusting myriad forms to their own proliferation.

**Yin** (乾) is easily understood,
**Yang** (坤) is simple in its efficacy—
not achieved by force,
so what need for exhaustion?
River Master Hu said:
*'In using the qi,
one must be **expansive and relaxed** (宽舒),
not **hasty and laborious** (急疾勤劳).*
Sū Zǐyóu said:
*'**Endless** (绵绵) means subtle yet unceasing.
**As if it exists** (若存) means existing yet unseen.
If one can achieve this,
even using it all day long will not weary.
When the mind is **settled** (定) and breathing **subtle** (息微),
entrusting to **spontaneity** (自然而无使气之强),
what need for exhaustion?
This passage’s essence lies in **cultivating the spirit with emptiness of heart** (虚心养神),
so that **non-death** (不死) resides in the Dark Mother.
The Dark Mother is the **source of Heaven and Earth** (天地之宗),
the **ancestor of yin and yang** (阴阳之祖),
concealing the spirit and harboring the qi,
upon which all things depend to form and grow.
The principle of **formation and growth** (生成) comes endless,
unceasing and unexhausted—
using it brings no weariness,
yet there is **acquisition and fruition** (有得有成).
All other schools expound externally,
but only River Master Hu’s **inner teachings** (内说) align with true principle.
To uphold it internally is to uphold it externally—
both meanings are valid,
and both are recorded here."*

**Chapter Seven: Heaven Long, Earth Enduring** (天长地久)
*"Heaven and Earth, though vast,
remain bound to **form and number** (形数),
so their longevity is measured.
Sū Zǐyóu said:
*'Though Heaven and Earth are vast,
they are not free from form and number,
so their **long duration** (长久) is quantified.'*
Zhāng Jūnxiàng said:
*'**Yin** (乾) is firm and broad,
covering all ages without tipping.
**Yang** (坤) is yielding yet thickly supportive,
enduring through all transformations, steadfast and unyielding.
The **Supreme One’s** (太上) words state:
**Heaven and Earth’s** (天地) **longevity** (长久) **extends to their utmost** (极),
yet this is merely what people perceive.
If one speaks of **ultimate longevity** (长久之至),
then the **origin of Heaven and Earth** (所谓天地始) is what is meant.
Heaven and Earth endure long because they **do not generate themselves** (不自生),
hence they can **long generate** (长生).*
Wang Yuanzé said:
*'To generate oneself means to have a **self-generated** (有其生) origin—
if one has such an origin, then **generation is already lost** (生既丧矣).
Only when there is no **pattern of generation** (无以生为则) does generation never occur—
if it never occurs, then the **hosted form** (所寓之形) though generated
bears no **burden of generation** (无生之累),
thus it should be **long and enduring** (宜其长且久也).
Heaven and Earth’s **non-self-generation** (不自生) is not a **benefit** (利乎),
yet it results in **long duration** (长久),
for the Dao is thus.'*
Zhāng Jūnxiàng said:
*'All things **self-cultivate their own generation** (自营其生),
but Heaven and Earth merely know to **generate and nurture** (生育) all things,
not self-cultivating their own generation.
To **bestow generation without self-generation** (施生不自生),
thus they attain **long duration** (得长久).
Hence the **Sage** (圣人) **lays aside the self** (后其身) yet **the self comes first** (而身先),
**discards the self** (外其身) yet **the self endures** (而身存).*
The **Imperial Commentary** (御注) says:
*'All take the **first** (先),
yet the Sage alone takes the **last** (后)—
this is called **receiving the filth of Heaven and Earth** (受天下之垢),
hence **laying aside the self** (后其身).
By laying aside the self,
one does not contend with things,
yet none can contend against them.
Hence it says: **lay aside the self yet the self comes first** (后其身而身先).
In **muddy paths**, one does not compete for **ease and danger** (涂不争险易之利),
in **winter and summer**, one does not compete for **harmony of yin and yang** (阴阳之和),
**discarding death and life**, **abandoning calamity and fortune** (外死生遗祸福),
yet the spirit is **never constrained** (神未尝有所困).
This is called **discarding the self yet the self endures** (外其身而身存).'*
Mǎ Jùjì said:
*'The Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth,
so **laying aside the self** (后身) and **discarding the self** (外身)
is like **not self-generating** (不自生).
To **self-generate yet endure** (自先身存) is like **long generation** (长生).
**Laying aside the self** (后身) means **yielding to others** (屈己),
**discarding the self** (外身) means **forgetting the self** (忘我)—
yielding to others means one is **beneath all** (人下之),
hence the self comes first.
Forgetting the self means **discarding the self**,
hence the self endures.
Is it not because of **no selfishness** (无私)?
Thus one can **fulfill their selfishness** (成其私).
The **Imperial Commentary** (御注) says:
*'The **greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth** (大德) is **generation** (生).
The **greatest treasure of the Sage** (大宝) is **position** (位).
The **Dao** (道) **makes it universal** (为之公).
Heaven and Earth embody the Dao,
so they have no selfishness—
no selfishness, hence **long duration** (长久).
The Sage embodies the Dao,
so they have no selfishness—
no selfishness, hence **constant endurance** (长存).
To **self-cultivate is selfishness** (自营为私),
yet none have succeeded in fulfilling their selfishness.'*
Lǚ Jìfǔ said:
*'The **self** (身) is my **selfishness** (私).
To **lay aside the self** (后其身) and **discard the self** (外其身)
is to **make it universal** (公而无私).
No selfishness,
thus one can **fulfill their selfishness** (成其私).'*
Mǎ Jùjì said:
*'Heaven and Earth do not self-generate,
just as the Sage **lays aside and discards the self**—
both are **no selfishness** (无私).
Yet Heaven and Earth **long generate** (长生) through this,
while the Sage **long endures** (长存) through this—
both **fulfill their selfishness** (成其私).
Yet **not selfishness for selfishness is great** (不私之为私大矣).*
Zhuāngzi said:
*'No selfishness,
yet it is **selfishness** (乃私也).'*
This passage states:
*'The Dao **makes it universal** (为之公).
Heaven and Earth embody the Dao,
so they have no selfishness—
no selfishness, hence **long duration** (长久).
The Sage embodies the Dao,
so they have no selfishness—
no selfishness, hence **constant endurance** (长存).
To **self-cultivate is selfishness** (自营为私),
yet none have succeeded in fulfilling their selfishness.
Scholars who embody the Dao’s **universality** (体道之公),
not selfish toward **one’s own self** (不私一己),
also attain **long duration** (得其长久)."*

**The True Scripture of the Dao and Its Power: Compilation of the Good, Volume Two**
**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good Is Like Water**

**Master Li Lin of Song’s Residence in Rao Yang** collected:

The supreme good is like water.
Master Su Shi said:
*"Heaven first generates water—
the Dao’s movement manifests as the good,
just as qi moves to generate water.
Thus it is said: the supreme good is like water."*

Water embodies three virtues close to the Dao,
and seven benefits for all things.
The person of supreme good is like this—
the Dao’s true good,
not what all under Heaven recognize as good.

The good is the Dao’s continuation;
water leads the Five Phases,
yet remains close to the Dao—
for when one departs from the Dao, the name "good" is established.

The supreme good is like water—
this is the natural principle of things.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
dwelling where others abhor,
thus approaching the Dao.

**Zhuǎn Wēi says:**
This is the three virtues close to the Dao.

Water’s nature is nourishing,
benefiting all things—
this is the first virtue.
It takes any shape, filling vessels,
flooding or draining as needed—
this is the second virtue.
Others abhor lowliness,
yet water flows downward—
this is the third virtue.

When water benefits things, its virtue is vast and kind;
when it does not contend, its power is humble and bright;
when it dwells in what others abhor, its capacity endures filth.
The three virtues of water—
only the Perfect One embodies them as one.
Such virtue and conduct, so close to the Dao,
thus it is said: *near.*

**Residing in the good place,**
Master Ma Jùjì said:
The good resides in humility,
water flows downward—
in the good, one finds water’s place.
Thus it is said: *residing in the good place.*
Where water resides, the good is the land’s benefit.
Where the good person resides, transformation extends to the neighborhood.

**The good heart is deep,**
**御 Commentary:**
The deeper one probes, the deeper it becomes;
the farther one seeks, the more distant it grows.
Master Ma Jùjì said:
The good rests in tranquility,
water in depth and stillness—
in the good, one finds water’s depth.
Thus it is said: *the good heart is deep.*
Master Cáo Dàochōng said:
Depth is where water rests.
Though winds and waves arise,
none can disturb its stillness.
The Perfect One’s heart is likewise.

Master Wáng Yuānzé said:
Deep and still, yet level—
inner clarity, outer obscurity.
With a heart deep and still, the flow returns to unity.

**Giving is kind,**
**御 Commentary:**
Compassionate love without selfishness,
giving without discrimination.
Master Su Shi said:
Benefiting all things,
giving without seeking—
this is kind giving.
Master Ma Jùjì said:
The good aids others—this is giving;
water benefits all—this is kindness.
In the good, one finds water’s kindness.
Thus it is said: *giving is kind.*

Where water flows,
nothing fails to nourish and benefit all things,
bringing them to completion.
The person of supreme good,
like water’s giving,
broadly benefits the people,
extends kindness to all beings,
aids all sentient life,
and seeks no return.
Thus it is said: *giving is kind.*

**Words are trustworthy,**
**御 Commentary:**
Avoiding obstacles yet reaching the seas,
traversing dangers without losing sincerity.
Master Lù Tìng said:
Treading a thousand dangers without losing sincerity,
encountering ten thousand reversals yet never losing direction—
this is called *words are trustworthy.*

**Governance is skillful,**
**御 Commentary:**
It purifies the impure,
smooths the treacherous,
follows the natural order of things,
and harbors no scheming heart.
Thus all is governed.
Emperor Xuánzōng of Tang said:
Skillful governance is like water’s cleansing—
making things pure and clear.
Master Wáng Bì said:
The good in governance is without filth or bias,
like water’s governance—
most pure, most level.
Master Liú Zhòngpíng said:
Yet water itself has no speech of governance,
so why say: *words are trustworthy, governance is skillful?*
Because this passage discusses the good person as water,
thus extending to *words* and *governance* as well.

**Actions are capable,**
**御 Commentary:**
Following the land’s contours to form curves and straightness,
adapting to vessels to become round or square,
changing with circumstances yet ever level—
none but the capable could do this.
Master Su Shi said:
Encountering things and taking their form without clinging—
this is capability.
Water’s actions change without constancy,
adapting to where it flows,
round or square as the vessel demands,
never opposing things—
thus nothing is beyond its capability.
The Perfect One is likewise,
following people and things,
conforming to the world without resistance.
Thus it is said: *actions are capable.*

**Movement is timely,**
**御 Commentary:**
The sun releases it, and it flows;
the cold congeals it, and it freezes.
If directed east, it flows east;
if directed west, it flows west—
moving without constraint,
proper only to follow the times.
**Zhuǎn Wēi says:**
The Perfect One’s dwelling is in humility,
naturally transforming,
extending to the neighborhood—
like water on the land,
dwelling in lowliness,
nourishing all things.
Thus it is said: *residing in the good place*—this is the first good.

The Perfect One’s heart preserves stillness,
penetrates the subtle,
deep and clear—
like water’s depth, serene,
its currents shifting ninefold,
never losing clarity.
Thus it is said: *the good heart is deep*—this is the second good.

The Perfect One’s giving is kind,
extending mercy to all under Heaven,
without favoritism—
like water’s nourishment,
rising and falling without exclusion,
benefiting all it touches.
Thus it is said: *giving is kind*—this is the third good.

The Perfect One’s words are trustworthy,
guarding sincerity without expectation,
naturally harmonizing—
like water’s reflection,
beautiful or ugly without distinction,
filling and flowing without loss,
traversing dangers without failure.
Thus it is said: *words are trustworthy*—this is the fourth good.

The Perfect One’s governance is skillful,
bringing order to the people,
upright and perceptive—
things naturally comply.
Like water’s purity and levelness,
settling high and low,
cleansing all things,
leaving no filth.
Thus it is said: *governance is skillful*—this is the fifth good.

The Perfect One’s actions are capable,
adapting to things,
assigning roles as needed,
never failing.
Like water’s yielding nature,
accommodating round or square,
forming to the vessel—
nothing it attempts fails.
Thus it is said: *actions are capable*—this is the sixth good.

The Perfect One’s motion and stillness,
skilled in observing the times,
emerging and withdrawing in response to opportunity,
able to preserve the Dao—
like water’s movement,
skilled in adapting to change,
congealing in winter, melting in summer,
never deviating from its course.
Thus it is said: *motion, skilled in timing*—this is the seventh good.

To act with foresight and move at the right time,
to move only when the moment is ripe—
this is like water’s spring thaw and winter freeze.

Only the non-contending
thus has no blame.
Su Ziyou said:
One who does good yet cannot escape human censure
does so because of contention.
Water, by not contending,
possesses all seven goods without blame.

This chapter speaks of water’s nature—
benefiting all things,
gentle and weak, yet not contending,
ever dwelling in lowliness—
thus encompassing the three abilities and the seven goods without blame.
Who, if not the Perfect One, could emulate this?

**Chapter Nine: Holding and Filling**
To hold and fill,
is not as good as stopping early.
Lu Jifu said:
To forcefully hold and fill
does not necessarily make one rich.
Holding is meant to prevent overflow,
yet filling leads only to greater overflow.
If one wishes to avoid overflow,
one should avoid filling entirely.
*Holding* means to grasp and retain;
*filling* means to overflow;
*stopping* means to cease.
To grasp and retain while also filling
inevitably leads to collapse—
thus, it is better to stop early.

To probe and sharpen,
cannot be long preserved.
Wen Gong said:
To probe and understand others’ intentions,
then aggressively pursue them,
is bound to fail.
Lu Jifu said:
To measure and then act is to seek what is precious.
Probing is meant to avoid loss,
yet sharpening leads only to greater loss.
If one wishes to avoid loss,
one should avoid sharpening entirely.
*Probing* is skillful in measuring intentions;
*sharpening* is sharp in seizing opportunities.
Probing and sharpening,
pursuing honor and fame—
though one may gain them,
one is certain to lose them,
thus they cannot be long preserved.

Gold and jade filling the hall,
none can guard them.
Shu Wang said:
*A hall* is empty and receives things—
when filled with gold and jade,
it is overflowing.
Thus it cannot be guarded.
Ma Jiuji said:
A hall’s depths are meant to store gold and jade,
yet its harm lies in being filled.
If not by heavenly calamity,
then by human disaster.
This shows that overflow is difficult to long preserve.

To be full yet not overflow,
is how one long guards wealth.
To hold and fill,
then gold and jade fill the hall,
none can guard them.

Riches and nobility bring arrogance,
inviting one’s own ruin.
*Commentary*:
Gold, jade, riches, and nobility
are not the essence of life.
They are external things one cannot rely upon.
To treasure gold and jade
is to be burdened by things.
Can one burdened by things avoid loss?
Thus none can guard them.
Riches and nobility bring arrogance,
harming one’s virtue.
Can one who harms virtue escape misfortune?
Thus one invites ruin upon oneself.

The Sage does not cling to worldly gain
as personal possession,
nor does He rule the world
for His own display.
What need has He for gold and jade as treasures,
or riches and nobility as burdens?
Thus the most wealthy nation’s treasures are shared,
the most noble nation’s honors are shared—
its nobility is unmatched,
its wealth unparalleled,
yet the Dao remains unchanged.
He Shang Gong said:
Wealth should relieve poverty,
nobility should pity the lowly—
yet if one instead grows arrogant,
calamity will follow.
Shu Wang said:
Riches and nobility do not invite arrogance,
yet arrogance comes naturally—
thus one invites ruin and misfortune.
This shows that sharpening cannot be probed.

To be high yet not perilous,
is how one long guards nobility.
To probe and sharpen,
then riches and nobility breed arrogance,
bringing ruin upon oneself.

When achievement is complete and fame is fulfilled,
withdrawal is the Way of Heaven.
Su Ziyou said:
The sun moves at noon,
the moon wanes when full—
the cycles of the four seasons,
those who achieve must depart.
Heaven and Earth do so—
how much more so for humanity.
*Achievement* is the benefit to others;
*fame* is the reputation applied to oneself.
When achievement benefits others and is fulfilled,
when fame is applied to oneself and is complete,
to withdraw and avoid position,
to forever avoid calamity—
this is the constant Way of Heaven.
This chapter warns:
Wealth should not be filled to overflowing,
nobility should not be indulged.
To hold and fill is not as good as stopping early;
to probe and sharpen only leads to defeat.
Gold and jade, when filled, are hard to guard;
riches and nobility, when indulged, invite ruin;
achievement complete, yet not held—
fame fulfilled, yet not clung to—
to know that loss is gain,
is to align with the Way of Heaven.

**Chapter Ten: Nurturing Vital Essence and Spirit**
*Nurturing vital essence and spirit*—
Wang Yuanzhe said:
*The spirit* is the essence of yin’s form.
The nature of spirit is vast and unbound,
yet it does not realize itself—
spirit always depends on vital essence,
thus the vast becomes constrained,
the unbound becomes obstructed.
Those who seek this Way
must first expand their will and qi,
not burdening themselves with form,
so that spirit rides vital essence
without being ridden by it—
then one may embrace unity and embody the spirit.

Ma Jiuji said:
Of a person’s life,
the yang aspects form the *hun* (spirit-soul),
the yin aspects form the *po* (vital essence-corpsesoul),
stored between the liver and lungs.
Precision and spirit interdependently generate life,
while vital essence governs their inflow and outflow.
The *po* follows spirit in its movements,
the *hun* follows precision in its transformations.
This passage speaks of *nurturing vital essence*—
*vital essence* is the same as *hun*.
*The Inner Observation Classic* says:
Movement that nurtures the body is called *hun*.
The *hun* governs all bodily functions,
driving the body’s operations—
as *hun*, it governs the inflow and outflow of precision,
mastering transformation and change.
Now, the hundred bones and nine orifices,
all that composes our form,
are the domain of vital essence.
Without the *hun* to nurture them,
how would they differ from a walking corpse?
Vital essence cannot exist without *hun*,
just as the moon cannot exist without the sun.
Vital essence depends on *hun* to function,
the moon depends on the sun to shine—
this is why *hun* is called *nurturing*,
and vital essence is called *vital essence*.
*Nurturing* means to embody in form.
Past interpretations all say *nurturing* is *hun*,
yet Wang Yuanzhe’s commentary uniquely defines *nurturing* as *po*.

One interpretation says *zài* means the form carries *hun* and *po*.
Another says the spirit carries *po*.
How can one embrace unity without separation?

King Shū of Chu replied: *"One"* refers to *jīng* (vital essence).
When *hun* and *po* are complete, *jīng* arises;
when *jīng* arises, the spirit follows.

Wang Yuanzhe said: *"One"* is the measure of *jīng*, but instead of saying *jīng*, it speaks of *"one"*—for guarding *"one"* prevents *jīng* from dispersing.

Mǎ Jùjì said: *Yíng* and *po* are distinct matters, differing only in embracing *"one."*
The Dao generates *"one,"*
*"one"* generates water,
water generates *jīng*—
for *jīng* is the substance of *"one."*
Embrace *"one,"* and it unites with *jīng*;
abandon *"one,"* and it separates from *jīng*.
When *jīng* is complete, *qi* is whole;
when *qi* is whole, the spirit is whole—
and with the spirit whole, one masters *hun* and *po* as a superior adept.

*Jīng* is the source by which heaven, earth, and all things are generated.
*Yíng* means "to stop"—
*po* is yin.
The form’s master abides within the form and has a place to rest,
so when speaking of *yíng-po* carrying, it means the spirit carries *po*.
If there is no spirit to carry it,
then it stagnates in dark yin,
the form scatters, the spirit departs,
and it decays with all things below.
But if the spirit constantly carries *po* without being carried by it,
then the refined yang-spirit consumes the yin-*po*,
and the body transforms into the Dao.

The matter lies in embracing *"one"* without leaving *"one"*—that is *jīng*.
Embrace *"one,"* and *jīng* unites with the spirit without separation,
then gather the spirit with *jīng*,
direct the form with the spirit,
preserve the spirit with the form—
when the three merge into one,
the Dao is complete.
Those who seek this Way must take *jīng* as the foundation.
Zhuangzi said:
*"Not departing from jīng"* is called the *shénrén* (spirit-person)—
this teaches nurturing *jīng*.

Can you concentrate *qi* and achieve softness like an infant?
Zhuǎn Wēi commented:
*"Speaking of those who practice concentrating qi and achieving softness,
they should be as pure and harmonious as an infant."*
If one can be as pure and harmonious as an infant,
then they have attained the art of concentrating *qi* and achieving softness.

When *jīng* is complete, the spirit reigns;
when the spirit reigns, it can command *qi*.
With the spirit concentrated over *qi*,
joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure do not control it—
this is how softness is achieved.
*"Concentrated"* means possessing and wielding authority;
*"soft"* means harmonious without violence.
When *qi* achieves softness,
it should be like the heart of an infant.
Desires unarisen, intent focused, mind unified—
throughout the day, one breathes deeply without strain,
until the throat relaxes in perfect harmony—
this teaches nurturing *qi*.

Can you purify and refine without blemish?
Mǎ Jùjì said:
This chapter establishes nurturing *jīng*, *qi*, and spirit as the root of Daoist practice,
so it speaks of *"no separation"* for nurturing *jīng*,
*"like an infant"* for nurturing *qi*,
and *"without blemish"* for nurturing the spirit.
*"Purify and refine"* refers to the heart.
*"Purify"* means washing the heart;
*"refine"* means carving it.
Wash it, and it becomes utterly still;
carve it, and it becomes utterly empty.
When the heart is empty and still,
no blemish remains.
Zhuangzi said:
*"Pure and unmixed, still and unchanging"*—
this teaches nurturing the spirit.

Can you govern the people and rule the state without action?
Hé Shànggōng said:
*"To govern the body, love qi and the body will be whole.
To govern the state, love the people and the state will be secure.
To govern the body, inhale and exhale *jīng-qi* without letting it be heard.
To govern the state, bestow virtue and kindness without letting the people know."*
This further explains the principle of embracing *"one."*

The *Inner Alchemy Classic* states:
*"The sage takes the body as the state,
the heart as the sovereign,
and *jīng-qi* as the people.
When the people are content, the state is mighty."*
*Jīng* is the foundation of the body;
cherishing and conserving *jīng-qi* brings order to the body.
The way of cherishing *jīng* is rooted in embracing *"one,"*
which is the natural Way—
what more is there to do?
Thus it is said: *"Can you act without action?"*

Now, those who refine *jīng* may pursue miscellaneous techniques,
treating *bān-yùn* (circulation) as their achievement,
and engage in excessive actions—
hence the warning against *"non-action."*
Zhuangzi said:
*"Only through non-action can the few be preserved."*

All other commentaries focus externally,
but Hé Shànggōng explains both inner and outer meanings.
Referring back to the earlier text,
those who speak of the body align with the Classic.

Can the opening and closing of the *tiānmén* (celestial gate) achieve receptivity?
Wang Yuanzhe said:
*"The perfected one has no intention in cultivating spirit and breath;
their responses are natural, without artificial prompting."*
This further explains concentrating *qi*.

There is fear that practitioners of *qi*-refinement may force *qi* too strongly,
so it is also warned against *"guarding the feminine"*—
for *"feminine"* means achieving softness.

Can one be enlightened and all-pervading without knowledge?
The commentary states:
*"Wisdom and sagacity, guarded by simplicity."*
This further explains *"without blemish."*
Practitioners of spirit-refinement,
pure and unadulterated, unobstructed and clear,
should not rely on knowledge—
instead, they must guard simplicity,
hence the warning against *"without knowledge."*

Nurture and preserve—
generate without possession,
act without reliance,
nourish without domination—
this is called *xiāndé* (mysterious virtue).
The commentary states:
*"The sage preserves the spirit and knows transformation,
harmonizing with the Dao as one body,
thus matching the divine in nurturing all things—
nothing is impossible.
Nurture them to fulfill their nature,
preserve them to perfect their nourishment.
Without the heart of love or gain,
hence generate without possession.
Without arrogance or self-aggrandizement,
hence act without reliance.
Without artificial constraint,
hence nourish without domination.
Such virtue is profound and distant,
contrary to all things—
thus it is called *xiāndé*."*

This chapter establishes nurturing *jīng*, *qi*, and spirit as the root of Daoist practice—
when the three merge into two,
the Dao is complete.

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**

Thirty spokes converge at one hub;
when the hub is empty,
the utility of the carriage arises.
Clay is molded into vessels;
when the vessel is empty,
its utility arises.
Doors and windows are carved for a room;
when the room is empty,
its utility arises.

The commentary states:
*"The unity of having and not-having,
the utility of entry and exit—
this is called the utmost spirit.
Having and not-having are contrasting forms;
their essence lies in *yǒu* (having) as substance,
and *wú* (not-having) as function—
the operation of yin and yang,
the principle of all things."*

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**

Thirty spokes share one hub;
when the hub is void,
the carriage’s function arises.
Clay is shaped into vessels;
when the vessel is void,
its function arises.
Doors and windows are carved for a room;
when the room is void,
its function arises.

The commentary states:
*"The marvelous function emerges from the utmost void,
transformation concealed in unburdened stillness—
like a mirror without image,
yet reflecting all things when they appear.
The sage employs the heart,
ever resolving in this principle.
Thus, having is used for utility,
voidness for function.*

*Zhong Hui says: "The three matters above illustrate that having and voidness mutually depend and neither can be neglected.
Thus, having is used for utility—
utility lies in substance.
Voidness is used for function—
function lies in emptiness.
Therefore, substance is external,
utility relies on emptiness to achieve completion.
Emptiness is internal,
function borrows substance for its manifestation.
But utility and voidness depend on each other—
none can be discarded.
Voidness depends on having for utility,
having borrows voidness for function—
the two principles interrelate.
Che Hui’s commentary: *‘To cultivate the self,
one must use substance to nourish emptiness,
and emptiness to guide substance.
Substance and emptiness mutually support the heart,
preventing it from leaning toward either—
thus attaining the sage’s utility and function.’*

*This chapter elucidates the interdependence of having and voidness,
utility and function,
using three matters to reveal the Great Dao.
The wheels and hub form the carriage,
clay shapes the vessel,
doors and windows define the room—
this is having,
which people depend on for utility.
The hub’s void allows the wheels to turn,
the vessel’s void holds things,
the room’s void shelters people—
this is voidness,
which people depend on for function.
Having brings real utility,
voidness must be employed for function.
Voidness is subtle,
function requires substance as its basis.
Having and voidness mutually depend,
just as form and spirit rely on each other
and cannot be neglected in isolation.
Spirit dominates form,
form houses spirit—
when form and spirit harmonize,
they mutually generate and perfect each other.
The ignorant in this world:
Those who refine spirit are obscured by voidness,
those who nourish form are drowned in having—
both lose their way.
Yet they fail to understand
that this chapter uses three objects as metaphors
to illustrate how having and voidness generate each other.
If one seeks to learn the Dao,
and practices according to this,
then form and spirit both attain perfection,
and align with the true Dao."*

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**

The five colors blind the eyes,
the five tones deaf the ears—
*The commentary states: "Even if one indulges the ears and eyes in sounds and colors,
though possessing the forms of ears and eyes,
they cannot see or hear themselves—
what difference is there from blindness and deafness?"*

The five flavors dull the palate—
*Wang Yuanze says: "Man is born in stillness,
yet moves with things.
The ears and eyes are inherently subtle and refined,
but when sounds and colors confront them,
true perception is lost to illusion and decay.
The palate’s relation to flavor is no different."*

Chasing and hunting drive the mind to madness—
*Lu Jifu says: "When nothing can perturb the mind,
stillness brings sanctity.
To pursue externals is to lose all thought,
and thus the mind descends into madness.
How much more so with reckless hunting and chasing?
The *Taikang* [of the *Yuejiu*] speaks of the Five Sons in blame,
and Ai Gong’s love of hunting is censured by the poets.
To indulge in external excess—
hunting without measure—
is to stray from true nature.
What is this but madness?"*

Rare treasures obstruct one’s path—
*The commentary states: "To covet rare treasures
is to reach for what endangers life itself.
Greed for wealth and honor—
how can one’s path remain steadfast,
when such things ensnare the heart?
Thus, Zhonghuai praised Tang [of Shang] with: ‘He did not accumulate wealth and gain.’
And Confucius told Zigong: ‘You do not await orders yet engage in commerce.’
Wealth’s obstruction of the path is evident."*

The moon’s gem and night’s jade—
mere tools for harm.
*Mencius says: "Jewels and jade
are sure to bring misfortune to oneself."
Thus, the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—
*Zhong Hui says: "True qi is internally abundant,
hence ‘nourishes the belly.’
External desires are discarded,
hence ‘does not indulge the eyes.’*
The five tones deaf the ears,
so the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—
all analogies follow this rule.
To nourish the belly is to preserve spirit and qi,
to not indulge the eyes is to abandon the six passions
and let the eyes not gaze wantonly.
Thus, discard that and take this—
*River Above Master says: "Discard the eyes’ wanton gazing,
take the belly’s nourishment of spirit.
The eyes govern external vision,
the belly governs internal containment.
The sage fills the belly,
not letting ears and eyes enslave the heart—
thus discarding the external-seeing eyes,
and taking the receptive belly.
Though the sage purifies the six senses,
here he speaks only of ‘not indulging the eyes’—
for once the eyes are controlled,
the rest may be inferred."*

*This chapter speaks of the harm of the five defilements,
to forget things and preserve true nature—
the sage’s principle of discarding and taking is thus revealed."*

---

**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**

Honor and humiliation are like sudden shock—
*Shu Wang says: "Honor becomes humiliation
because it is like sudden shock."*
*Ma Jiuji says: "Honor is the root of humiliation,
for it binds the heart to gain and loss.
If one is seen as honored by others,
the greater the shock—
honor is but another form of humiliation."*

Great calamity is like being burdened by one’s own body—
*The commentary states: "Honor is lower, nobility is higher.
To dwell in honor and take it as glory
is to invite humiliation.
To hold nobility yet see it as a burden
is to court the greatest calamity.
Nobility means exalted rank.
When the heart clings to nobility,
its affliction is great indeed.
Like a body that moves and strains itself—
what is honor and humiliation?
Honor is the lesser."*

*The commentary states: "To crave fame or covet wealth,
knowing how to advance yet not retreat,
knowing how to gain yet not lose—
to receive honor from others
is to embrace the path of inferiority.
Why does honor become humiliation?
Because receiving honor from others
places the power of gain and loss in their hands.
If one’s heart is weighed down by such gains and losses,
how can it remain unclouded?"*

Ziwen served three times and resigned three times,
without joy or displeasure in his face—
*Was there any humiliation for him?*
To gain is like shock,
to lose is like shock—
this is called honor and humiliation as sudden shock.*

Wen Gong said:
*"For the scholar, virtue and the Dao take precedence,
while rank and emolument are secondary.
The former brings honor,
the latter brings humiliation.
The common crowd delights in their humiliation,
yet trembles when they grasp it,
and weeps when they lose it.
To possess it is as if it were already theirs,
to lose it is as if it never existed—
how could there be any shock?
If, at the moment of gain or loss,
one’s heart still trembles with shock,
then this is true humiliation.

Liu Xia Hui served as a magistrate,
thrice dismissed yet never departing,
while Zheng Kao Fu received three summons
yet fled along the walls—
these are different indeed.

What is meant by *‘treating great calamity as one’s own body’*?
*The commentary states:*
To wield power and authority,
to bestow rewards and punishments at will,
to create blessings and instill awe—
when the world fears you like a deity,
when they revere you like the Supreme—
this is true nobility.
Yet the Sage does not burden himself with such nobility,
and thus can long preserve it without exhaustion.
It is like a man who, when his limbs are severed,
when his senses are dulled,
when he is stripped of form and intelligence,
becomes one with the boundless—
then nothing enters that he does not find himself within.

The people of the world exchange their nature for things,
and thus are burdened by things yet cannot forget their power.
They bind their form to their heart,
and thus lose their heart yet cannot forget their form.
Their calamity is great indeed.

Wang Yuanze said:
*Nobility lies above things,
yet those who possess kingdoms and families cannot forget them—
this is a great calamity.
It is like a man who treasures his body yet is burdened by it—
then cold, heat, sickness, and pain all assail him—
is this not a great calamity?
My greatest calamity is that I have a body.*

He Shang Gong said:
*My greatest calamity is that I have a body.
Having a body means fearing its movement and labor,
pondering hunger and cold,
indulging emotions and desires—
then misfortune befalls.
The body is a calamity,
for I cling to it—
this is a great calamity.
But when I have no body,
what calamity remains?*

Cai Zi Huang said:
*‘No body’ means not regarding the body as a self.
In this, one forgets the interplay of creation and self,
and thus transcends calamity.
This is not the destruction of the body to achieve ‘no body’—
rather, though the body exists, one does not cling to it,
and thus, in having it, one is without it.
As with Confucius’ mother,
when she mourned her son Ziqi—
this is the case.

Thus, to hold nobility for the world
is to entrust the world to it.
To love the world with one’s body
is to commit the world to it.
*The commentary states:*
*The world is a sacred vessel—
without the Dao, it cannot function.
The world is a divine instrument—
without the Dao, it cannot be preserved.
The Sage embodies the Dao,
and thus can govern the world with ease,
while the world rejoices in its support without exhaustion.
The next best course is to know one’s own nobility
and not degrade oneself,
serving things instead—
this is how one may entrust the world to them.
To know one’s love for life
and not harm oneself,
suffering under things instead—
this is how one may commit the world to them.

Thus it is said:
*The true Dao governs the self,
its overflow extends to the state and the world.
The upright govern the world.*

Yet the vulgar gentlemen of the world
endanger their bodies and abandon their lives
to serve things—
is this not tragic?

Wang Bi said:
*Without things to exchange for one’s self,
this is nobility.
Without things to diminish one’s self,
this is love.
Only thus can one entrust the world to them.
If one does not use honor and humiliation,
calamity and joy,
to exchange or diminish one’s self,
then only then can the world be entrusted to them.

The noble do not humiliate their bodies,
those who love do not endanger their bodies—
only thus can the world be entrusted to them.
Men like Zizhou’s Zhi Fu and Wang Zi Sou are examples of this.
These two did not glory in their honor
nor burden themselves with nobility.

This chapter speaks of humiliation arising from honor,
forgetting honor means no humiliation.
The body is the root of exhaustion,
forgetting the body means no calamity.
Having forgotten the burdens of honor and nobility,
one severs the worries of shock and calamity,
and thus, in treasuring and loving one’s body,
one can entrust the world to it.*

**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**

That which cannot be seen is called *Yi*.
*Commentary*: The eyes govern vision, and vision discerns objects. *Yi* is smooth and without distinction—beyond what vision can reach, hence called *Yi*.
The *Taiyi* was unseen in its primordial *qi*—thus it is.

Master Wang Yuanze said: The Dao extends to all things, equal and without high or low—beyond what the eyes can see. This illuminates the Dao.
*Yi* means "smooth and effortless."
The Dao is not a color, so it cannot be seen.
Though unseen, it manifests as dark and as yellow—it cannot be called without color, only *Yi*.

That which cannot be heard is called *Xi*.
*Commentary*: The ears govern hearing, and hearing discerns sounds. *Xi* is subtle yet audible—beyond what hearing can grasp, hence called *Xi*.
The Great Sound is subtle in its voice—thus it is.
Zhuangzi said: What can be heard has a name and a sound.
The Dao has no sound—beyond what the ears can hear, hence called *Xi*.
Though unheard, it resonates with *gong* and *shang*—it cannot be called without sound, only *Xi*.

That which cannot be grasped is called *Wei*.
*Commentary*: So subtle, so formless—who can grasp it?
The Great Image is without form—thus it is.
Formless is *Wei*.
*Bó* means "to hold or seize."
The Dao is without form, so it cannot be seized.
Though ungraspable, it manifests as yin and yang, soft and hard, short and long, round and square, hot and cold, light and heavy, bitter and sweet—within the formless, it forms. Hence it is called *Wei*.

These three cannot be summoned or questioned,
so they merge into one.
*Commentary*: The *Taiyi* was undifferentiated—no division of high or low.
The Great Sound is subtle in its voice—no distinction of clear or turbid.
The Great Image is without form—no measure of great or small.
The eyes have no use for their brightness,
the ears no need for their sharpness,
the body no exhaustion in its effort—
the Dao’s completeness lies here,
in its depth beyond exploration,
its mystery beyond attainment.
*Qi*, form, and substance coexist yet do not separate,
so they merge into one.

Though merged into one, can it not be spoken of?
The three refer to *Yi*, *Xi*, and *Wei*.
What cannot be summoned or questioned
refers to the formless, soundless, shapeless—
the mouth cannot speak it,
the script cannot transmit it.
Receive it in stillness,
seek it with spirit—
it cannot be questioned and attained.
*Hun* means "to merge."
The three names merge into one,
for they are originally one body,
yet people name them according to their approach—
sometimes seeing, sometimes hearing, sometimes grasping.

Its upper reaches are not bright,
its lower depths are not dark.
Master Wang Yuanze said: All things, having substance, possess yin and yang—
the upper bright, the lower dark—this is inevitable.
Only the Dao, without substance, merges and becomes whole.
This speaks of the Dao’s fixed nature.
Zhuangzi said: Those who lose the Dao
see light above and become earth below.
*Shéngshéng*—ineffable, returning to nothingness.
Master Lü Jipu said: *Shéngshéng*—straight and trustworthy.
Though trustworthy, it cannot be named,
so it returns to nothingness.
This is called the "form of no-form,
the image of no-image"—
this is called *hūhuǎng*.
Master Zuan Wei said: To return to nothingness is not to speak of emptiness or stillness.
Within the formless, it shapes all forms;
within the imageless, it transforms all images.
To say it is "having" yet see no form—
this is having yet not having.
To say it is "not having" yet things arise from it—
this is not having yet having.
*Huǎng* is the doubt of having in non-having,
*hū* is the doubt of non-having in having.
The Dao, as a thing, is neither having nor non-having—
its name cannot be fixed, hence *hūhuǎng*.

Approach it, and you see no head;
follow it, and you see no tail.
*Commentary*: Its beginning has no head,
its end has no tail—
so approaching or following,
there is what cannot be seen.
Master Su Shiru said: The Dao is everywhere—
no front or back to be seen.
Hold the ancient Dao
to govern the present.
Master Wang Bi said: Though ancient and present differ,
the Dao remains constant.
Only by holding it can one govern things.
Master Lü Jipu said: Without front or back,
it is neither ancient nor present.
Though neither ancient nor present,
it is never without ancient or present.
Thus I say: Hold the ancient Dao
to govern the present.
To know the ancient beginning
is called the "Dao’s measure."
Master Lü Jipu said: The "ancient" is not different from the "present"—
to know the origin of the ancient.
The "present" is not different from the "ancient"—
to know the source of the present.
If one truly knows the origin of the ancient,
one knows the source of the present.
The beginning has no origin,
the source has no coming—
this is called the "measure of no-end."
The measure of no-end is the Dao’s measure.
The Dao cannot be held.
Yet by attaining this, one can hold it
as *virtue*.
To hold *virtue* is called "measure."
Master Wang Yuanze said: Pushing upward to the origin of nothingness,
one knows things have no source.
The Dao’s essence is attained—
the Dao’s measure,
the unchanging essence of ancient and present—
this is what Zhuangzi called the "measure of no-end."
Master Li Tian said: This chapter speaks of the wondrous root’s application—
what is there that it does not encompass?
If sought through seeing or hearing,
it is utterly unattainable.
If examined for brightness or darkness,
it is utterly undivided.
Images cannot be named,
beginnings and ends cannot be seen—
its use is difficult to fathom,
yet it governs all things.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage-Scholar**

The ancient sage-scholars were subtle, profound, and penetrating,
deep beyond recognition.

**Shu Wang said:** The term "sage-scholar" (*shànwéi-sì*) denotes one who practices the Dao/Way. At its beginning, when one is still a sage-scholar, one has not yet departed from practicing the Dao/Way. At its end, when one becomes a sage, one is unified with the Dao/Way—so much so that the Dao/Way cannot be spoken of separately, for it is one with the Dao/Way. This is what is meant by "subtle, profound, and penetrating, deep beyond recognition."

**Ling Xian said:** The Dao/Way encompasses all names—this is what it means to be "good." The practice of the Dao/Way reaches all things—this is what it means to be a "sage-scholar." The previous chapter grasped antiquity to govern the present; this chapter governs the present while drawing upon antiquity. The previous chapter discussed the Dao/Way’s complete essence; this chapter speaks of the sage-scholar’s embodiment of the Dao/Way.

"Subtle" (*wēi*) is the opposite of "manifest"; "profound" (*miào*) is the opposite of "dangerous." "Profound" implies depths beyond measure; "penetrating" (*tōng*) implies endless transformation. The ancient sage-scholars who embodied the Dao/Way possessed this Way yet concealed it in mystery beyond measure—who could truly recognize them? Hence it is said, "deep beyond recognition."

Only because they are beyond recognition does one forcibly attribute form to them. **Commentary:** The heavens’ height cannot be hastily measured; the earth’s depth cannot be hastily fathomed. When it says, "round to cover, square to bear," it merely approximates their form. To forcibly attribute form to them—how could one truly grasp their ultimate essence? This refers to the following text: Only because the Dao/Way is vast and difficult to recognize does one forcibly attribute form to it.

Like crossing a river in winter,
or fearing one’s neighbors;
**Master Lü Ji said:** The butcher Ding dissects an ox with ease, yet remains cautious—his gaze halts, his movements deliberate, the knife’s strokes barely perceptible. This is what is meant by "like crossing a river in winter." Caution arises at the outset of action. Once the task is done, the pieces lie scattered like earth; he stands with his knife, gazes around, and sighs with satisfaction, then sheathes his blade. This is what is meant by "like fearing one’s neighbors." "Like" implies careful restraint at the conclusion of action. Caution is rooted in preemptive stillness; "like" is rooted in lingering doubt after completion. "Crossing" refers to movement above the knees; "river" refers to the convergence of many streams. To cross a river is to encounter difficulty. In winter, the cold is extreme—yet to wade through a great river alone is to demonstrate that the ancient sage-scholars disliked action, only undertaking it when necessity demanded. They were always pressed into action, yet ever cautious in their approach. Hence it is said, "like crossing a river in winter"—once the crossing is made, there is no further hesitation. Yet when it comes to restraint, they are like the ancient sage-scholars, who were ever still and deep, never leaving their true nature. They always acted as if fearing their neighbors, gathering themselves without excess, repelling evil while preserving sincerity. No external things could probe them, for their hearts never strayed—hence it is said, "like fearing one’s neighbors."

Like a guest’s solemnity;
**Master Wang Yuanze said:** They did not take action as their own responsibility, so their bearing was tranquil. **Zhuàn Wēi said:** A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way stands solemnly upright, his mind unscattered, as if a guest facing his host—how could he dare to be hasty? When the term "container" (*róng*) is used, it is like Dongguo Shunzi’s composed demeanor, which made others’ intentions fade. Hence, Tianzi Fang revered him as a teacher. When the term "guest" (*kè*) is used, it is like Li Contained-Light residing in a darkened chamber, as if facing his lord and father—hence, Sima Zimeng praised him so highly.

Like ice about to melt;
**Commentary:** Water congeals to become ice; ice melts to return to water—they are fundamentally one. Those who cling to one-sidedness are like water congealing. Those who align with the great harmony are like ice melting. The *Yì* says: "Melt" (*huàn*) is "separation"—separating from others without attachment, hence it is called "melt." The *Sayings* say: "Congealed yet dispersed is 'melt.'" Water has no inherent ice; when it encounters cold, it congeals. Nature has no inherent obstruction; when it encounters things, it binds. A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way suddenly awakens to great insight—all affairs vanish, like spring ice melting away.

Like the solid yet simple;
**Commentary:** "Solid" (*dūn*) means the utmost thickness. Nature is fundamentally thick, like uncarved wood, before it disperses into vessels. This describes nature’s completeness. The *Classic* says: "Return to the uncarved."

Like the vast yet hollow;
**Commentary:** "Vast" (*kuàng*) means the utmost breadth. Nature is originally boundless, like a valley’s emptiness, receptive yet responsive. This describes nature’s hollowness. The *Classic* says: "The highest *virtue/power* is like a valley."

Like the turbid yet undifferentiated;
**Master Wang Bi said:** Concealing essence, hiding radiance—externally, they do not differ from things. They blend with dust and waves, hence it is said, "like the turbid." **Master Yangzi said:** "Unified, they are turbid; separated, they disperse." To be turbid is to blend with the world without separation, hence it is said, "like the turbid." This is what Zhuangzi called "aligning with things and flowing with their waves," differing from those who rigidly adhere to principles and reject worldly customs.

Thus, the sage-scholars who embody the Dao/Way: in winter, they dislike action, yet fear their neighbors and guard against later dangers; like guests who do not act as hosts; like ice that melts without obstruction; solid yet complete, vast yet hollow, turbid yet undistinguished by worldly norms—this is what is meant by "deep beyond recognition," yet forcibly attributing form to them.

Who could make the turbid clear?
Stillness gradually purifies.
**Master Wang Yuanze said:** To clarify nature is like clarifying water. Overworking makes it murkier with motion; only by waiting in stillness does it gradually clear itself. A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way is never made turbid by things, for his stillness gradually purifies.

**Master Cao Daochong said:** Would one follow the flow and forget to return? One merely clarifies stillness to gradually purify.

Who could make the settled endure?
Motion gradually arises.
**Commentary:** A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way is both settled and in motion—when he acts, he does so with ease, yet remains rooted in his original nature. He is fixed yet able to respond to all things; he is empty yet fulfills all demands. Hence, stillness gradually purifies, and things cannot make him turbid. Motion gradually arises, yet things cannot unsettle him. The *Yì* says: "Coming gradually" (*lái xúxú*)—gradualness implies ease and self-adaptation. The ancient sage-scholars’ use of their hearts is not to stop with stillness as good, but to have stillness as their intention. Nor is it to generate motion as their achievement, but to have motion as their purpose. They follow their inherent nature, entrusting it to its own course, without urgency or haste.

Thus it is said: When stillness gradually purifies, ten thousand things cannot perturb his heart—who could make it turbid? When motion gradually arises, ten thousand things cannot ensnare his thoughts—who could unsettle him? If one seeks stillness with the intent to stop, he will be bound by things, and thus will stop. How then could he respond to things without harm? Those who preserve the Dao/Way do not desire fullness.

Master Ma Juji said: Those who preserve without desiring fullness do so because the Dao/Way gathers in emptiness. Fullness, when it exists, is easily discerned. Only the unfull can—

Master Lü Jifu said: Though it is not called emptiness but always fullness, it is to prevent people from being burdened by emptiness. If one is burdened by emptiness, then it is not emptiness. Hence it is said: *Some* do not desire fullness, yet do not desire fullness. Thus they avoid exhaustion while remaining unspoiled.

Master Wang Yuanzai said: Those who attain the Dao/Way never become full, thus those who perfect the Dao/Way never become new. The Dao/Way’s function endures through ten thousand ages without exhaustion, for it has no exhaustion, no renewal, no completion, no ruin. Exhaustion arises from renewal, ruin from completion. Though a sage-scholar may perfect the Dao/Way, if he remains ever renewed, then he will never know exhaustion or ruin. This chapter speaks of the sage-scholar’s embodiment of the Dao/Way, profound beyond recognition, concluding with the admonition: *Do not desire fullness*—for emptiness is its essence. Emptiness is void and boundless, without a single thing—how could the world ever comprehend it?

The ancients who preserved this Dao/Way—like Great Yu who did not boast of his achievements, or Confucius who did not dwell on his sainthood—sought only emptiness. Laozi embodied emptiness itself, while Yanzi embodied the reality of emptiness. Here, it is clear that the Dao/Way gathers in emptiness.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Chapter of Attaining Emptiness to Its Utmost**

Attain emptiness to its utmost, guard stillness with sincerity.

**Commentary:** Nothing is more precious than emptiness, nothing more virtuous than stillness. Emptiness and stillness are the root of all things. Emptiness suffices to receive all things; stillness suffices to respond to all motion. *Extreme* means gathering all things to reach a point; *sincere* means establishing conduct to reach a point. If one attains emptiness while seeking its utmost and guards stillness to reach sincerity, then though myriad forms may be diverse, my heart remains ever clear, and though myriad changes may differ, my heart remains ever tranquil—this is called Heaven’s joy. Only those who embody the Dao/Way can partake in this.

Master Zhong Hui said: *Attain* means *reach*. To attain emptiness is to reach the utmost of emptiness. To guard stillness is to reach the utmost of stillness. When emptiness is attained, like a valley receiving all things, without a speck of dust accumulating—this is called *extreme*. When stillness is guarded, like water responding to all motion, without a hair’s breadth of disturbance—this is called *sincere*. As all things arise together, I observe their return.

Master Yan Zun said: Heaven and Earth return and invert, thus enduring forever. Man returns to sleep, thus attaining clarity. Dragons and serpents return to their dens, thus their scales shine. Grasses and trees return to their roots, thus they remain verdant. When transformation returns, spirit and clarity attain their proper places, communicating with emptiness, the soul rests, the vital breath is tranquil, each finds its place of ease, the will is serene, the qi harmonious, the blood and vessels balanced—these are but temporary returns to stillness, yet still they preserve their spirit. How much more so for those who long endure in the utmost Dao/Way?

I am the *command* given to all things. With emptiness and stillness attained to their utmost, I observe the arising of all things, commanding them without being transformed by them—thus it is said: *I observe their return*.

All things, teeming and diverse, each return to their root.

Master Wen Gong said: Things arise from non-being, return to non-being.
Master Wang Yuanzai said: From nature arises use, returning to nature’s root—though movement and stillness differ, their principle converges.

Returning to the root is called stillness.

Master Su Ziyou said: If one cannot return to nature, even if he ceases motion and stills thought to seek stillness, it is not stillness. Only by returning to the root can one attain stillness.

Man is born in stillness—this is Heaven’s nature. To return to nature is to be still. Stillness is called returning to command.

Master Lu Tian said: Speaking of the root, one knows there is an origin; speaking of command, one knows there is nature. Thus, returning to the root is called stillness, and returning to command is nature. Zhuangzi said: From the root and origin, before Heaven and Earth existed, from ancient times it has endured. *From the root* is returning to the root, called stillness. *From the origin* is returning to command, called stillness. *From ancient times* is returning to command, called constancy. *From the origin* is without dependence on an origin. *From the root* is without emergence from a root. *From ancient times* is without passage through time. Though returning to the root is called stillness, returning to command is called constancy, and returning to constancy is called constancy, their essence is one.

The order of speech—first root, then origin; first nature, then command—when speaking of the root, it is called returning; when speaking of command, it is called returning. Returning is not yet attainment; returning is attainment. The root is not yet attainment; command is attainment. The depth of returning is profound. Returning to command is called constancy.

Master Wang Yuanzai said: To be born from the Dao/Way is called command. To return to command is to revert to one’s origin, uniting with the Dao/Way, thus enduring through eternity without change. To know constancy is called clarity.

Master Shū Wang said: Constancy is the designation of that which has been unchanging since before beginning. To know its constancy is called clarity. Outside the Dao/Way, all is unconstancy. Though the Dao/Way is true and constant, formless and nameless, without self-awareness of its clarity, few escape being obscured by things.

Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and ruin.

**Commentary:** The sage-scholar knows the constancy of the Dao/Way, thus his actions align with principle and always meet with good fortune. Those who do not know constancy drift with things, encountering misfortune at every turn, and cannot even preserve their own lives—thus they are ruined. Master Sun Deng said: Unable to return to the root and guard stillness, one’s life is cut short and constancy lost—this is the source of ruin.

The multitude not knowing the true constancy of the Dao/Way,
take delusion for constancy,
thus joy and sorrow arise,
and action brings its loss—
life’s vitality then fades.
This is what is meant by reckless action bringing ruin.

To know constancy is to embrace tolerance.
Su Ziyou said:
*"When lost in delusion, one clings to self and rejects others,
seeing all things as enemies—
how then could one tolerate them?
But if one knows all is delusion,
even foes shall be pitied and spared—
what then cannot be embraced?"*

Tolerance is virtue/power.
He Shang Gong said:
*"To embrace all without exclusion,
virtue/power is just and without partiality—
no evil can withstand it."*

The *Records of Rites* states:
*"When the Great Dao prevails,
the world is held in common.
No man cherishes only his own kin,
nor loves only his own children."*

Virtue/power is sovereignty.
Shu Wang said:
*"To abandon private gain is to achieve virtue/power;
to exhaust one’s measure is to attain sovereignty.
Virtue/power is the root of virtue/power—
sovereignty is its manifestation.
To act from virtue/power is to remain hidden within,
to act from sovereignty is to shine outward.
Virtue/power and sovereignty unite—
the Dao of inner and outer harmony."*

Cheng Xuanying said:
*"Sovereignty is to go forth—
virtue/power makes all things return."*

Sovereignty is Heaven.
Wang Yuanzhe said:
*"Sovereignty is the utmost of human conduct.
To exhaust human conduct is to align with Heaven."*

Heaven is the Dao/Way.
*Commentary*:
*"He who harmonizes Heaven, Earth, and humanity,
and stands centered between them, is the Sovereign.
One and vast above all, encompassing without end—this is Heaven.
Heaven, Earth, and humanity all move through it—this is the Dao/Way.
To exhaust humanity is to align with Heaven;
to embody Heaven is to align with the Dao/Way."*

The Dao/Way is enduring.
Lu Yu said:
*"Enduring means lasting—
to measure against the boundless void,
neither coming nor going,
the mind plunged to its utmost,
neither arising nor perishing,
mysteriously unified by nature,
indivisible—
this, when attuned to its principle, is called enduring.
Thus, one’s life may fade without peril."*

The *New Sayings* state:
*"What Heaven follows is the Dao/Way.
Thus it is said: Heaven is the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way has neither ancient nor modern—
thus it is said: The Dao/Way is enduring.
When the Dao/Way reaches this enduring state,
one’s life may fade without peril—
who could surpass this?"*

This chapter’s meaning lies in returning to the root and restoring vital command.
Thus it begins with emptiness and stillness,
and concludes with the Dao/Way’s enduring nature—
for the Dao/Way takes emptiness and stillness as its foundation.
To grasp this and enter the Dao/Way
is like abandoning the boat to wade across—
how ineffectual!"

**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Dao**
The Supreme Dao—
the lower knows its existence.

「Wang Yuanzé said: In the age of the Three Sovereigns (*Sān Huáng*), there was governance without action (*wúwéi*), allowing the people to each fulfill their nature (*gé suì*) without knowing it was so. How could one claim personal credit for this?

Má Jùjì said: To know of a ruler (*jūn*) but not know of one’s ruler—this is the age of the Three Sovereigns.

As Zhuangzi said: The Taiyi (*Tàishì*) moved with leisurely ease in sleep, and awoke with serene clarity. One moment he took himself as horse, the next as ox.

The *Supreme Dao* (*Tàishàng*) refers to the nameless ruler (*jūn*) of the most ancient times (*Tàigǔ*). *Tài* means "the utmost," *shàng* means "the highest." Governance without action, the utmost and highest—none of the later ages could surpass this, hence it is called *Supreme Dao*.

To say "the lower knows its existence" (*xià zhī yǒuzhī*) means knowing of a ruler but not serving as a subject.

The next stage is to be cherished by the people and praised by them.
Má Jùjì said: Benevolent love (*huì ài*), this is *virtue* (*rén*), hence the people are cherished. Rewards and punishments (*shǎng fá*), this is *righteousness* (*yì*), hence the ruler is praised. Yet even when cherished, the people grow distant; even when praised, the ruler’s power is undermined—this is because they still fall short of the *non-human* (*fēi rén*) ideal.

This is the age of the Two Emperors (*Èr Dì*).

As Zhuangzi said: The age of the Yu (*Yú*) did not reach that of the Taiyi.

Yáo’s benevolence was like Heaven’s, and those who approached him did so as if drawn by the sun.
Shùn reached the outskirts of Dengyu, and ten thousand families came to him—this was cherishing the people.
Kāng Qú praised Yáo, and the songs of praise (*ōng gē*) accompanied Shùn—this was praising the ruler.

The next stage is to be feared by the people and scorned by them.
Zhàn Wēi said: When *virtue* (*rén*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) are lost, legal punishments (*xíngfǎ*) are established, and the people fear them.

Má Jùjì said: This is the age of the Three Kings (*Sān Wáng*).
As Zhuangzi said: When *virtue* (*rén*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) extended to the Three Kings, the world was greatly alarmed. Those who loved wisdom exhausted the people, and then the age of cudgels and saws (*zhuī záo yāng yán*) came.

When wisdom reaches its extreme, great deceit (*dàwěi*) arises. The clever exploit those below them, and the foolish scorn those above, while punishments are insufficient to deter them—this is the age of the Five Hegemons (*Wǔ Bà*).

As Mencius said: The Five Hegemons relied on this.

Wang Yuanzé said: When *virtue/power* (*dé*) is lost and governance (*zhèng*) fails, the people scorn the ruler.
Trustworthiness is insufficient, and distrust arises.

The *Imperial Commentary* (*Yù zhù*) states: When bonds are not reinforced with glue or lacquer, and restraints are not secured with ropes or cords, this is the utmost trustworthiness. The Shang people made oaths (*shì*) and the people began to betray them; the Zhou people made assemblies (*huì*), and the people began to doubt them—this is because trustworthiness was insufficient.

When the *Supreme Dao* is known only as "the lower knows its existence," then one should not know it as trustworthy. In the next stage, where the people fear and scorn the ruler, one knows of deceit. When Jiāo Huá’s cunning and Jì’s scheming arise, distrust begins.

Emperor Xuānzōng of the Tang (*Táng Míng Huáng*) said: Those who fear and scorn the ruler are all due to the ruler’s insufficient trustworthiness, causing those below to have distrustful hearts.

Even so, the ruler’s words are still honored.
Emperor Xuānzōng said: When the ruler is cherished and praised, it is because the ruler has words of *virtue/power* (*dé jiào*), hence his words are honored and he is cherished and praised.

Má Jùjì said: When words are not inherently honored yet are still honored, this is why it is said that though it falls short of the *Supreme Dao*, the ruler’s words still transform without explicit action. From this point onward, emperors have *canons and admonitions* (*diǎnmó*), and kings have *oaths and proclamations* (*shì gāo*).

When achievements are complete and affairs are settled, the people say: "This is our natural state."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The ruler’s achievements are the *Dao/Way’s* (*shèngrén*) remaining work. To make the people content with their food, pleased with their clothing, secure in their dwellings, and joyful in their occupations—this is the *Dao/Way’s* remaining work sufficient to complete the ruler’s achievements. Yet the people say only: "This is our natural state."

They say: "What has the ruler’s power to do with us?" This is called the governance of the *Supreme Dao*.

Emperor Xuānzōng said: When achievements are complete yet not seized, and affairs are settled yet without further action, the people say: "The ruler acts as if this were our natural state." What part does the ruler’s power play in it?

This chapter speaks of the distinct transformations of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, how the people’s customs swayed, the *Dao/Way* descending into *virtue/power* (*dé*), *virtue/power* declining into legal punishments (*xíng*), and punishments failing to control—inevitably leading to deceit and scorn. This is because trustworthiness was insufficient in the ruler, and the people had their doubts.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Dao/Way is Abandoned**
The *Dao/Way* is abandoned, and *virtue* (*rén*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) arise.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: When the *Dao/Way* is lost, *virtue/power* (*dé*) follows; when *virtue/power* is lost, *virtue* (*rén*) follows; when *virtue* is lost, *righteousness* (*yì*) follows. *Virtue* establishes the people, *righteousness* establishes oneself—this is far from the *Dao/Way*.

Han Yu did not grasp the true intent of the Sage’s *virtue/power* (*shèngrén dé yì*), instead claiming that *seven* (*qī*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) were definitive names, while *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power* (*dé*) were empty titles. Laozi’s *small virtue* (*xiǎo rén*) and *small righteousness* (*xiǎo yì*) were but narrow views.

As Zhuangzi said: These are the *people obscured by delusion* (*bìméng zhī mín*).

The *Supreme Dao* is the same as the *Dao/Way* of the most ancient times without action (*wúwéi*).
When *virtue* and *righteousness* are not manifest, it is like the sun at its zenith while all stars lose their luster. *Abandoned* (*fèi*) is the same as *hidden* (*yǐn*).

After the Three Sovereigns, people’s hearts were not pure and sincere. The *Supreme Dao* was hidden and unseen, while *seven* (*qī*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) were established and the *Dao/Way* declined. Like fish leaving the ocean for stagnant pools, the people then valued *benevolent care* (*rúmò zhī ēn*) more.

Having lost the *Dao/Way’s* natural path, the people then valued *virtue* and *righteousness*’s blessings more.
As Zhuangzi said: The *Dao/Way* is hidden in minor achievements.

When wisdom arises, great deceit arises.
Emperor Xuānzōng said: Those who employ wisdom seek to establish laws. When laws are established, deceit arises, and then great deceit emerges.

Wisdom (*huì*) has wisdom (*zhì*) as its essence, and wisdom (*zhì*) has wisdom (*huì*) as its application. Wisdom has great and small distinctions.

As Zhuangzi said: Abandoning minor wisdom (*xiǎo zhì*), great wisdom (*dà zhì*) becomes clear.
As Confucius said: Those who delight in minor cleverness (*xiǎo huì*) are said to have wisdom—this shows that wisdom has great and small distinctions.

The *Supreme Dao* says: These are the ones who take cudgels (*záo*) as wisdom and keen scrutiny (*chá*) as insight, crafting clever laws and decrees—this is minor wisdom.

Once wisdom arises, the people’s deceit and trickery flourish.
If one instead observes both near and far with tranquil ease, doing nothing yet benefiting all, following their natural state without adding or detracting—when the true and pure customs prevail, how could there ever be great deceit?

When the six bonds (*liù qīn*) are not harmonious, filial piety (*xiào*) and tender care (*cí*) arise.
Zhōng Huì said: If all nine kin (*jiǔ zú*) are in accord, then love and respect are without limit. When the six bonds are not harmonious, then filial piety and tender care are emphasized.

The blind and the deaf were considered foolish, yet Shùn was called a great filial son.
Zēng Xǐ was stern, yet his brother Zǐshēn was praised for nurturing him.
When the state is in chaos and confusion, loyal ministers arise.

Shū Wáng said: The *Dao/Way* is hidden in the formless, and names arise from insufficiency.»

The *Dao/Way* hides in the formless, then there is no distinction between great and small.
Names arise from insufficiency, then there are gradations of virtue, righteousness, wisdom, and sagacity.

The virtuous have that which they love.
The righteous have that which they distinguish.
Because of their love and distinction, this is how the Great *Dao/Way* is abandoned.

The wise know.
The sagacious discern.
Because of their knowing and discerning, this is how great deceit arises.

The filial honor their own kin, the tender care for their own children—this is how the six bonds become discordant.

The loyal are loyal to their own lord, and this is called loyalty; to another’s lord, it is called rebellion.
To be unclear is called benighted.
To be ungoverned is called chaotic.
In a benighted and chaotic age, loyal ministers arise to rectify their lord.

The *Transmission* says: *"In turbulent times, true ministers appear."*
As when Longfang’s fame flourished under Xia Jie, and Bi Gan’s praise resounded under Yin Zhou.

This chapter speaks of the *Dao/Way* hidden in the small, and names arising from insufficiency.

**Chapter Nineteen: Abolish the Sage, Discard Wisdom**

Abolish the sage, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.
Zhōng Huì said: Abolish the sage who makes laws, discard the wisdom of scheming, and people will return to simplicity and purity—thus their benefit is a hundredfold.

The maker is called the sage; the creator is called the wise.
The sage and the wise establish laws and decrees, desiring to curb deceit and suppress violence—yet how do they know that laws breed deceit and edicts spawn trickery? The people lose their true nature, ever drifting toward competition and strife.

If laws and edicts are abolished, the people will revert to their natural state and simplicity—how could their benefit be merely a hundredfold?

Zhuangzi said: *"Sever the sage’s limbs, release the thief and bandit, and the world will begin to be governed."*

Abolish virtue, discard righteousness, and filial piety and tender care return.
Wang Yuanzhe said: In an age of perfect virtue, parent and child naturally suffice.
Now, if we further generate virtue and righteousness, then names and realities become entangled, gains and losses confused—chaos ensues among the people.
For what flourishes at the end must have decayed at its root—this is the *Dao/Way* of Heaven.
Filial piety and tender care are the root of virtue and righteousness.

Some say: The *Dao/Way* of Confucius and Mencius, of Yao and Shun, is centered on virtue and righteousness, while the *Dao* of Laozi is the true path. How can it be said that Xia valued birth as merit, while Zhou valued austerity as virtue—one makes them flourish and abandon their roots, the other withers them and returns to their essence?

The *Dao/Way* is the seasons; the sage adapts to the times.
To understand the *Dao/Way*, then Confucius and Laozi are the beginning and end of each other.

Abolish cleverness, discard profit, and thieves and bandits vanish.
Wang Yuanzhe said: When cleverness and profit prevail, people’s desires grow extravagant, and their foundational pursuits decline—inevitably leading to theft.
The three matters above all harm the root through their excess.

Cleverness is ingenuity.
The clever are those who excel in deceit and profit.
Seeing profit while forgetting righteousness—if ingenious scheming is abandoned, people will know shame; if the heart of desire is discarded, people will know righteousness—this is how thieves and bandits vanish.
If cleverness and profit are not abandoned, and only laws are multiplied to forbid them, this is how thieves and bandits proliferate.

Zhuangzi said: *"Sever the artisan Tu’s fingers, and the world will begin to have its own cleverness."*
And again: *"Break the jade, shatter the pearls, and petty thieves will not arise."*

These three matters are insufficient as ornamentation, hence their reliance on external attachments.
Ma Jiuji said: Substance is in excess, ornamentation is insufficient—these three have strayed far from their root, serving only as superficial adornment. This is their insufficiency.

The four matters below are assigned to their natural attributes.

**Seeing Simplicity, Embracing Purity.**
Shū Wáng said: It is not said "guard simplicity" but "see simplicity"—not "return to purity" but "embrace purity"—not "have no selfishness" but "have little selfishness"—not "have no desires" but "have few desires." For only by seeing simplicity can one guard it; only by embracing purity can one return to it; only by having little selfishness can one achieve none; only by having few desires does one reach the point where there is nothing to be seen.

Seeing simplicity reveals the true nature, untainted by external things.
Embracing purity preserves the whole essence, unharmed by external things.

**Having Little Selfishness, Few Desires.**
The *Commentary* says: Self-seeking is selfishness, and nothing nourishes the heart better than its absence.
Few desires and little selfishness—few desires clarify the distinction between inner and outer, true and false. Virtue is complete, and nature is restored.

Ma Jiuji said: "Seeing simplicity" belongs to the sage’s aversion.
That which is unmixed is called simplicity; to see simplicity is to see the *Dao/Way*, to see the *Dao/Way* is to take no action, and taking no action means there is no sage, no wisdom.

"Embracing purity" belongs to virtue and righteousness.
Whole material is called purity. To embrace purity is to embrace nature, to embrace nature is to be without artifice, and without artifice means there is no virtue, no righteousness.

"Little selfishness, few desires" belong to cleverness and profit.
Self-possession is selfishness; having things is desire, and cleverness and profit arise from them.
Little selfishness and few desires mean cleverness and profit decline.

The *Zhuangzi·Tú Kuāng* chapter precisely clarifies the harm of sages, wisdom, righteousness, cleverness, and profit—this aligns with the intent of this passage.

Selfishness is my body.
Little selfishness means not burdening oneself with cleverness and profit.
Desire is the movement of nature.
Few desires mean not disturbing one’s heart with cleverness and profit.

Li Tian said: This chapter speaks of cutting off growth by uprooting the root, and suppressing overflow by blocking the source.
If lawmaking does not flourish, then true simplicity appears.
If ornamentation of righteousness is not applied, then purity is preserved.
If cleverness and profit are not practiced, then selfishness and desire are extinguished.
Then Heaven’s harmony flows naturally, and daily life is effortless.

**Chapter Twenty: Abolish Learning, Have No Worry**

Abolish learning, have no worry.
The *Commentary* says: Learning is to exhaust principle. When one is diligent in learning to exhaust principle, deliberating over good and evil, comparing order and chaos—how could there be no worry?

Learning is to attain the *Dao/Way*; seeing the *Dao/Way* and then abandoning learning—reducing it, reducing it again, until one reaches non-action and yet nothing remains undone—then one follows the natural disposition of life, finding joy in whatever arises, and thus has no worry.

**Chapter Twenty: Abolish Learning, Have No Worry**

Wen Gong said: The reason learning cannot be abandoned is to seek the *Dao/Way*.
If one abandons the root and pursues the branches, then laboring without result is inevitable—better not to learn and have no worry at all.

The *Absolute Learning* speaks of embodying the *Dao/Way*.
To embody the *Dao/Way* is to find joy in poverty and in prosperity, treating poverty and prosperity as the changing seasons—neither rejoicing in life nor dreading death, for life and death are but the natural cycles of night and day. When Heaven and Earth rejoice, all affairs dissolve into nothingness—what worry remains?

Moreover, *Absolute Learning* does not mean to utterly discard learning.
Laozi feared that men would drown in learning, letting words extinguish essence, drowning in knowledge, unable to embody the *Dao/Way*—thus he spoke of *Absolute Learning*.
If one does not learn, how then can one enter the *Dao/Way*?
Zixia said: The virtuous man learns to attain his *Dao/Way*.
To attain the *Dao/Way* is to forget the self entirely—this is why learning must be *Absolute*.

As for those who do not learn, they are empty and void—what need have they of *Absolute Learning*?
Yet Yangzi said: "If a man does not learn, though he may have no worry, he is like a beast—how does he know the *Dao/Way* of the Sage's *Absolute Learning*?"
The distance between *yes* and *no* is slight.
The difference between *good* and *evil* is minimal.

*The Commentary* says: Though *yes* and *no* differ in sound, they arise from the same voice. Though *good* and *evil* differ in nature, they both depart from the *Dao/Way*.
To illustrate, the learned man is like *yes* or *good*, while the unlearned is like *no* or *evil*.
Learning leads to wisdom, while not learning leads to folly—
the wise may err, the foolish may fall short,
yet both equally stray from the *Dao/Way*.

What men fear, they must fear.
*The Commentary* says: The *Dao/Way* moves all things yet does not share the Sage’s worry—
calamity and fortune are shared with the people, but affairs are not.
To embody the *Dao/Way* is to have no worry;
to engage with affairs is to know fear.
If one fears what men fear yet does not take it as a warning,
few will escape exhaustion.
Thus the virtuous man uses fear to reflect and correct himself.

*The Odes* say: Fear the might of Heaven.
The Tang Emperor Ming Huang said: What common men fear is arrogance and wickedness.
What the virtuous fear is worldly learning and striving—
both must be abandoned, hence the need for fear.
The masses labor in learning yet fail to grasp its truth;
when all affairs are summoned, they only disturb the mind—
this is what men fear, and it too must be feared.
If one does not *Absolute Learning*,
there is no way to embody the *Dao/Way*—
thus it is.

Oh, the wildness of it!
How endless it shall be!

River Master Yang said: The world is in chaos, and men rush to study, seeking words—
there is no end to it.
*Wildness* is the state of neglect.
If one does not *Absolute Learning*,
then one’s true nature is abandoned and neglected—
the worry of neglect has no end.

The masses bustle and rejoice,
as if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
as if ascending the terrace in spring.

Wang Yuanzhe said: The transformations of nature are boundless; affairs are called *life*.
Only the Sage can unify past and present without change,
while the masses follow transformations in vain,
seeing beauty and evil, joy and gain in their *life*,
and deeming it all beautiful.
*Spring* is when all things flourish and depart from stillness,
when they move and abandon the root for the branches.
*The terrace* is where one gazes far upon all scenes.
Without understanding ultimate principle, all things generate emotions—
their state is thus.

All things flourish with *yang* and congeal with *yin*.
*Yang* governs motion, *yin* governs stillness.
The bustling state is the symbol of an active nature, delighting in joy.
*Grandest sacrifice* refers to the cow—its flavor is the richest.
*Spring* is the peak of the season’s transformations.
*The terrace* is where one gazes far upon all scenes.

「Thus, I liken the multitude to those who, through study, cultivate falsehood,
who, chasing fleeting scenes, lose their true nature—
their state is as such.

The Dao is indeed insipid, without embellishment,
substantial yet not ostentatious—
the delight of those who abandon learning.

To pursue learning is to lose the Dao,
to stray from the natural stillness of one’s essence,
to roam externally in vain—
their hearts are restless, yet they savor profound truths
as if relishing the richest flavors to nourish their appetites,
and broaden their perceptions
as if beholding lofty splendor to gratify their minds.
Those ensnared by pleasure,
ever more distant from the Dao.

I alone am *pure*—
before any signs appear.

Like an infant yet to mature—
*pure* in its simplicity.

*御注* says: The *Classic* states—
*"Return to the infant state."*
The infant’s thoughts are still unformed,
treating near and far alike—
*pure* in stillness, harmonious and gentle within,
its brilliance not yet manifesting outward—
thus like the infant yet to mature.

*Pure* means
stillness without flow.
In stillness, one attains the flavor of the insipid,
restoring the original unity of nature—
how different is this from the infant?

*Buoyant* yet without attachment—
as though belonging nowhere.

*御注* says: The Sage rides the Six Dragons in accordance with the seasons to govern the heavens.

*Buoyant* means
to follow the natural course of things without leaning toward one extreme—
thus like belonging nowhere.

*Buoyant* is the appearance of movement.
The Perfect One in stillness aligns with the infant,
in motion rides the transformations of all things—
adapting to change without fixation,
hence called *buoyant*.

The masses all have excess—
*马巨济* says: Nature lacks excess or deficiency;
what is called excess is merely external adornment.

Feasting on the *Grandest Sacrifice* and ascending the *Spring Terrace*,
all they gain is external adornment.

Thus, I speak of excess.
The masses pursue learning, increasing their knowledge—
hence the excess.

But I alone seem abandoned—
*马巨济* says: To seem abandoned is not true abandonment,
merely a reluctance born of insufficiency.

True abandonment is for those who do not learn.
The Perfect One does not abandon learning—
rather, they sever it to preserve the Dao,
diminishing their perceptions,
as the saying goes: *"For the Dao, one must daily diminish."*

My heart is that of a foolish man,
*pure*—
*马巨济* says: This belongs to the meaning of *"I alone seem abandoned."*
The masses pursue learning to acquire wisdom,
but I alone abandon it—
thus I am a foolish man.
Yet *pure* means untainted—
though foolish, I am not foolish.

*Zhuangzi* says: *Pure* means one’s spirit remains undefiled.
Foolishness is lack of wisdom.
*Pure* means unadulterated.
Learning never ceases to multiply wisdom,
but abandoning learning discards wisdom
and seems like foolishness—
*"Great wisdom resembles foolishness."*

The common folk are sharp and discerning—
I alone seem dim.

The common folk are keen and strict—
I alone am *obscured*—
*纂微* says: *Keen* means rigorous clarity.
*Obscured* means spacious ease.

The worldly, through learning, govern with laws—
rigid institutions, harsh decrees,
priding themselves on their actions—
thus the people barely survive.

Hence, the Perfect One follows Heaven’s natural course,
conforms to the Dao’s patterns,
and in yielding to the world,
embraces spacious ease—
*obscured*—
so the people may preserve their true nature.

*Zhuangzi* says: At the Dao’s utmost extreme,
*obscured* and silent—
this is what is meant.

Minor clarity is called *sharp*,
lack of clarity is called *obscured*.

The common folk are keen and strict,
perceiving minutiae, calculating hidden truths—
they deem this *sharp* clarity.

*Sharp* is not true greatness.
Those who abandon learning embody the Dao,
discard wisdom, and merge with all things—
without distinction—
thus they seem *obscured*.
*Obscured* is not innate dullness,
but a state of suchness.

If one governs by *sharp* clarity,
rigor and strictness prevail—
*"A man too keen has no followers."*
If one governs by *obscured* ease,
spaciousness and breadth emerge—
*"Constantly yielding to things,
never diminished by others."*

Sudden as if eclipsed,
*tranquil*—
as though no end in sight.

*御注* says: The depths of stillness
and the settled nature—
the complete embodiment of the Dao.
Change without loss—
the Dao’s practical application.

The masses all have purpose—
*马巨济* says: I alone seem *coarse*—
like a rustic.

*御注* says: The osmanthus can be eaten,
so it is pruned.
The lacquer can be used,
so it is cut.

All know the use of useful things,
but none grasp the use of the *useless*.

The masses’ purpose is the use of useful things—
I alone seem *coarse*,
like a rustic—
the use of the *useless*.

*The Classic* says: *"The heart that does not conform to the patterns of virtue and righteousness is called *coarse*."*
Anciently, it was said:
*"To call the capital *beautiful* is to be *coarse*."*
*"To call the wilderness *rustic* is to be *coarse*."*
*Coarse* means not embellishing wisdom,
*rustic* means not perceiving beauty—
thus the Perfect One remains *useless*.

*马巨济* says: *Use* means application.
The masses’ learning seeks worldly application—
what is called the use of the useful.
Yet how would they know
that abandoning learning is truly the most useful?

*Coarse* and *rustic*—
this is so.
For *sharp* and *keen* mean
distinct clarity between root and branch—
not the *useless*.

Thus, I alone differ from others,
and value nourishment from the *Mother*.

*马巨济* says: This concludes the meaning of *"the infant yet to mature."*
The infant takes the *Mother* as its foundation,
before maturity feeds on its root—
after maturity, on its branches.

The Dao is the root,
learning is the branch.
Others feed on branches,
I feed on the root—
this is how I differ.

Yet the Sage does not prize difference,
while I alone do—
this chapter’s theme is to extol abandoning learning,
for only by differing from the world
can one save the world.

This section emphasizes abandoning learning.
Every sentence within carries the intent of severing learning.
If one does not abandon learning,
the more one hears and sees,
the more one drowns the heart—
the Dao becomes obscured.
Thus, the chapter ends by valuing nourishment from the *Mother*,
for the *Mother* is the Dao.
Only by abandoning learning can one cultivate the Dao—
this is how those with the Dao
differ from the common folk.»

「The *Dao De Jing* ["Classic of the Way and Virtue"]—*Taking the Good* in its Third Volume—*Taking the Good* in its Fourth Volume—*Li Lin of Song’s* ["宋饶阳居士李霖集"] Collection of *Dao De Jing* ["Classic of the Way and Virtue"].

**Chapter 21: The Appearance of Virtue** ["孔德之容"]

The appearance of virtue follows only the Dao.

**Commentary of the Master** ["御注"]:
The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao; by this interplay, all things are born and thus possess virtue.

The Dao is ever nameless,
how can it be described in words?—
thus its virtue is made divine.

Virtue has form and substance,
and all things share in it—
thus the Dao is revealed.

**Zhuangzi’s Annotation** ["纂微曰"]:
The Dao is ever nameless,
only virtue reveals it.

Virtue without root,
formed by following the Dao.

Speaking of those with great virtue,
their appearance transcends all forms—
how can they be seen as crooked?

Only the appearance of one who follows the Dao
barely reveals their true state.

In their movements and demeanor, they observe propriety—
this is the peak of virtue.

Those with peak virtue appear foolish,
how can they be seen as crooked?
Only those who follow the Dao
can be glimpsed as such.

Thus, when the eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, mouth speaks,
hands hold, and feet walk—
all are but the Dao.

Thus, the appearance of virtue follows only the Dao.

The Dao, as a thing,
is but vague and indistinct.

**Commentary of the Master** ["御注"]:
The Dao’s essence is absolute nothingness,
yet its manifestations are wondrous—
this is why it is called a thing.

Yet all things are but the Dao.
Vague—where there is form to be likened,
indistinct—where there are numbers to be traced.
But what is called "having" is but doubt of "nothingness."
Thus it is said: The Dao, as a thing.

**Gu Xuan’s Explanation** ["顾欢曰"]:
To speak of its definite existence,
yet it has no color, no sound.
To say it is definite nothingness,
yet it has trust and precision.
Since its essence cannot be defined,
it is called but vague and indistinct.

Thus, observing it as such
is called following the Dao—
this is how one attains it.

**Ma Jujie’s Explanation** ["马巨济曰"]:
When nothingness appears as having—
this is vague.
When having appears as nothingness—
this is indistinct.
This is the Dao’s thing.

The Dao, in its vague and indistinct nature,
returns to nothingness—
this is what cannot be contained.

**Wang Yuanzhe’s Explanation** ["王元泽曰"]:
The Dao encompasses yin and yang.
The subtleties of yin and yang,
when they appear as neither having nor nothingness,
are called vague and indistinct.

Indistinct yet vague—
within it, forms arise.
Vague yet indistinct—
within it, things manifest.

**Commentary of the Master** ["御注"]:
What is seen is called form,
what is shaped is called thing.
Within vague and indistinct,
forms and things are complete—
like vast space transforming into thunder and wind,
like great mass becoming water and fire,
to bring forth change,
to move the numinous and divine—
this is the Dao’s wondrous work.

Faint and dark—
within it, essence resides.

**Commentary of the Master** ["御注"]:
Faint—the extreme of seclusion,
dark—the concealment of illumination.
Within faint and dark,
the origin of supreme yin,
where Heaven’s One manifests—
essence truly arises.

Its essence is exceedingly true,
within it, trust resides.

**Wang Yuanzhe’s Explanation** ["王元泽曰"]:
Essence—the beginning of form’s birth.
Essence is never false,
yet it is further called "exceedingly true"—
because things may lose their proper order,
and essence, likened to human artifice, may err.

The essence within faint and dark,
gives rise to all things,
and the things born,
each follow their natural form and measure,
their laws and patterns—
once a standard is set,
the future can be known without deviation,
this is called trust.

**Zhuangzi’s Words** ["庄子曰"]:
Before form, there is division.
Essence—the peak of Heaven’s virtue.
True, then it is not false;
trustworthy, then it does not err.
From ancient times to today,
its name does not fade.

**He Shang Gong’s Words** ["河上公曰"]:
*Self*—to follow.
From ancient times to today,
the Dao remains unceasing.

**Wang Yuanzhe’s Explanation** ["王元泽曰"]:
The Dao is constant in name,
never changing or transforming.

**Ma Jujie’s Explanation** ["马巨济曰"]:
As all things transform and change,
their names shift accordingly.
What was once called "right"
is now called "wrong."
Yet what remains steadfast through ages past and present—
the Dao alone.

Thus, it oversees all beginnings.

**Wang Bi’s Explanation** ["王弼曰"]:
All beginnings—
the origins of things.
To oversee with the nameless
the origins of all things—
this is to oversee.

To oversee—
as when one examines many texts.
How do I know all beginnings are thus?
By this.

**Su Shi’s Explanation** ["苏子由曰"]:
The Sage knows how all things are one
through essence.
*Pattern*—law.
*One*—the source of all multiplicity.
The Sage attains the world with the few,
yet is troubled by the many.
The Sage embraces *One* without departing from essence,
the world abandons multiplicity and returns to *One*—
thus the Sage becomes the world’s law and pattern.

Not self-revealing, hence clear;
**Commentary of the Master** ["御注"]:
Not obscured by one’s own limited perspective,
then nothing remains unseen—
hence clear.

Yu Shun’s four eyes widened his vision,
this can be called not self-revealing.
To perceive all things,
to discern human relations—
this is not clear?

Cheng Wang’s open and unconstrained mind,
unblocked within himself—
this can be called not self-revealing.
To illuminate all and be illuminated in return,
this is not clear?

Not self-affirming, hence manifest;
**Commentary of the Master** ["御注"]:
Not partial to one’s own rightness,
yet following only what is right—
then great is their achievement,
bright their fame,
and the world submits—
hence manifest.

**Lu Jifu’s Explanation** ["吕吉甫曰"]:
To follow what the world affirms as right,
yet I do not self-affirm—
then what is right cannot be exhausted.
Thus it is said: Not self-affirming, hence manifest.

Not self-praising, hence meritorious;
**Commentary of the Master** ["御注"]:
*The Book of Documents* ["《书》"] says: "You alone do not praise yourself,
then the world cannot contend with you for merit."

**Shu Wang’s Explanation** ["舒王曰"]:
Not self-praising, then goodness is not lost—
hence meritorious.

Not self-boasting, hence enduring;
**Commentary of the Master** ["御注"]:
*The Book of Documents* ["《书》"] says: "You alone do not boast,
then the world cannot contend with you for ability."

**Lu Jifu’s Explanation** ["吕吉甫曰"]:
To entrust all things with ability,
yet I do not self-boast—
hence enduring.

Thus, only by not contending,
the world cannot contend with them.
**Commentary of the Master** ["御注"]:
Others take the lead,
I alone remain behind—
this is to bear the world’s filth.

「若是者，常处於不争之地，孰能与之争乎。
Thus, if one remains steadfast in the Dao of non-contention,
who could contend with them?

苏子由曰：忘我则不争。
**Su Ziyou** ["苏子由曰"] says:
When one forgets the self, contention ceases.

不自是，不自见，不自伐，不自矜，
Not clinging to one’s own correctness,
not self-displaying,
not self-praising,
not self-boasting—
all are remnants of non-contention.

故以不争终之。
Hence, they attain the ultimate through non-contention.

古之所谓曲则全者，岂虚言哉。
The ancients spoke of *yielding to preserve wholeness*—
was this not sincere?

河上公曰：古者曲从则全身，此言非虚。
**He Shang Gong** ["河上公"] says:
In ancient times, yielding and compliance preserved the body—
this saying was not in vain.

诚全而归之。
Indeed, wholeness returns to its source.

御注：圣人其动若水，以交物而不亏。
**Commentary of the Master** ["御注"]:
The sage’s movement is like water,
interacting with all things without depletion.

其全其应若绳，以顺理而不失其直。
Their wholeness and responsiveness are like a measuring line,
following the natural order yet never losing their straightness.

知洼之为盈，无亢满之累。
They know that *hollowing* ["洼"] is true abundance,
and avoid the burden of arrogant fullness.

知弊之为新，无夸耀之迹。
They know that *imperfection* ["弊"] is genuine renewal,
and leave no trace of vain display.

若性之自为而不知为之者，致曲而已。
If one acts according to nature’s spontaneous self-so,
yet does not know who does so—
they merely achieve yielding.

故全而归之，可以保身，可以尽年，而不知其尽也。
Thus, when wholeness returns to its source,
one can preserve the body,
fulfill their lifespan,
yet remain unaware of its completion.

是谓全德之人，岂虚言哉。
This is called the person of *complete virtue*—
was this not sincere?

锺会曰：诚能守曲，全必归之。
**Zhong Hui** ["钟会"] says:
If one truly upholds yielding,
wholeness will inevitably return.

此章之义，养生之旨也。
The meaning of this chapter is the principle of *nourishing life*.

其要在乎忘我。
Its essence lies in forgetting the self.

惟忘我，故委曲以应变，而不自恃一己之见。
Only by forgetting the self
can one bend and yield to respond to changes,
without relying on their own limited perceptions.

枉己而伸人，而不私一己之道。
They sacrifice themselves to benefit others,
without hoarding their own Dao.

知洼之为盈，无自伐之心。
They know that *hollowing* is true abundance,
and thus have no pride in self-praise.

知弊之为新，无自矜之行。
They know that *imperfection* is genuine renewal,
and thus avoid self-boasting conduct.

若性之自为而不知为之者，致曲以全，其形生而已。
If one acts according to nature’s spontaneous self-so,
yet does not know who does so—
they merely achieve yielding for wholeness,
and life’s form is all.

故终始以曲，则全言之。
Thus, from beginning to end, if one persists in yielding,
wholeness is fully achieved.

希言自然章第二十三 希言自然。
**Chapter Twenty-Three: Sparse Speech in Accord with Nature**

希言自然。
Sparse speech in accord with nature.

顾欢曰：希，少也。 人能爱气少言，则行合自然。
**Gu Huan** ["顾欢"] says:
*Sparse* ["希"] means *few* ["少"].
If a person cherishes qi and speaks little,
their actions align with nature.

纂微曰：夫至人有问，即应接物，即言动静以时，故合於自然。
**Zuan Wei** ["纂微"] says:
The *perfected one* ["至人"] responds to inquiries,
interacts with things,
and speaks of movement and stillness in due measure—
thus harmonizing with nature.

陆佃曰：夫物莫能使之然，亦莫能使之不然者，谓之自然。
**Lu Dian** ["陆佃"] says:
That which cannot be made to be so,
nor prevented from being so—
this is called *nature* ["自然"].

飘风不终朝，骤雨不终日。
Gale-force winds do not last a full morning,
torrent rains do not last a full day.

王元泽曰：风雨者，阴阳交感所为。 飘骤者，交感之过，所以不能久也。
**Wang Yuanzhe** ["王元泽"] says:
Winds and rains arise from the *interaction of yin and yang* ["阴阳交感"].
Gale-force and torrent are excesses of this interaction—
thus they cannot endure.

飘风，疾风也。 骤雨，暴雨也。
*Gale-force winds* ["飘风"] are swift winds,
*torrent rains* ["骤雨"] are sudden downpours.

从旦至哺为终朝，自早及暮为终日。
From dawn to midday is a full morning,
from early to evening is a full day.

飘风骤雨，气之暴戾，非出於常然也。
Gale-force winds and torrent rains are violent and untamed qi,
not arising from the usual order of things.

故虽天地为之尚，不能有终朝终日之久。
Thus, even though the heavens and earth honor them,
they cannot last a full morning or a full day.

人之言不出於自然，则多言数穷宜矣。
When a person’s speech does not arise from nature,
excessive words will inevitably exhaust them—
this is fitting.

孰为此者，天地。
Who does this?
The heavens and earth.

天地尚不能久，而况於人乎。
The heavens and earth themselves cannot endure—
how much more so for humans?

御注：天地之造万物，风以散之委众形之自化，而雨以润之任万物之自滋，
**Commentary of the Master** ["御注"]:
The heavens and earth create ten thousand things:
the wind scatters them, entrusting their forms to spontaneous transformation,
while the rain nourishes them, allowing all things to grow naturally.

故不益生，不劝成，而万物自遂于天地之间。
Thus, they neither *aid life* ["益生"] nor *urge completion* ["劝成"],
yet all things flourish naturally between heaven and earth.

所以长且久也。
This is how they endure long and last.

飘骤则阴阳有缪戾之患，必或使之，而物被其害，故不能久。
Gale-force and torrent rains bring the calamity of *errant yin and yang* ["缪戾"],
compelling their use—
when things suffer their harm,
they cannot endure.

风雨者，阴阳交感所为。 飘骤者，交感之过。
Winds and rains arise from the interaction of yin and yang;
gale-force and torrent rains are excesses of this interaction.

天地之大犹不能久，况人处天地之间，眇乎小哉。
Even the vast heavens and earth cannot endure—
how much more so for humans, who dwell within them,
so small in comparison?

为於多言速灭可知。
It is clear that excessive speech leads to swift annihilation.

故从事於道者。
Thus, those who follow the Dao—

王弼曰：从事谓举动从事於道者也。
**Wang Bi** ["王弼"] says:
*Following the Dao* ["从事"] means *acting in accordance with the Dao*.

道以无形无为，成济万物。
The Dao, without form or action,
accomplishes and nurtures all things.

从事於道者，以无为为君，不言为教，
**Those who follow the Dao** treat *non-action* ["无为"] as their sovereign,
and *non-speech* ["不言"] as their teaching.

绵绵若存，而物得其真，
They persist like unbroken threads,
and thus all things attain their genuine nature.

与道同体，故曰同於道。
They share the same substance as the Dao—
thus it is said: *They are in accord with the Dao*.

道者，同於道。
*Following the Dao* ["道者"] means *being in accord with the Dao*.

河上公曰：道者，谓好道之人。
**He Shang Gong** ["河上公"] says:
*Following the Dao* ["道者"] refers to those who love the Dao.

同於道，所谓与道同。
*Being in accord with the Dao* ["同於道"] is what is called *aligning with the Dao* ["与道同"].

德者，同於德。
*Virtue* ["德者"] means *being in accord with virtue*.

河上公日：德者，谓有德之人。
**He Shang Gong** ["河上公"] says:
*Virtue* ["德者"] refers to those who possess virtue.

同於德，所谓与德同。
*Being in accord with virtue* ["同於德"] is what is called *aligning with virtue* ["与德同"].

失者，同於失。
*Losing* ["失者"] means *being in accord with loss*.

蔡子晃曰：有为躁竞，执教生迷，名为失。
**Cai Zihuang** ["蔡子晃"] says:
*Action* ["有为"] and *restlessness* ["躁竞"],
clinging to teachings and thus generating confusion—
this is called *loss*.

既为同失，不能虚心冥会，而言道失者，独失道也。
If one aligns with *loss* ["同失"],
yet cannot maintain an empty heart to intuitively grasp the Dao,
and still speaks of *losing the Dao* ["道失"]—
they have lost the Dao alone.

自然之谓道。
What is called *nature* ["自然"] is the Dao.

从事於道者，悟道忘言，所谓与道同。
Those who follow the Dao awaken to the Dao and forget speech—
this is what is called *aligning with the Dao* ["与道同"].

得道之谓德。
Attaining the Dao is called *virtue*.

德者希言，所谓与德同。
*Virtue* ["德者"] is marked by sparse speech—
this is what is called *aligning with virtue* ["与德同"].

失道之谓失。
Losing the Dao is called *loss*.

失者多言，所谓与失同。
*Loss* ["失者"] is marked by excessive speech—
this is what is called *aligning with loss* ["与失同"].

同於道者，道亦得之。
Those who align with the Dao,
the Dao also attains them.

同於德者，德亦得之。
Those who align with virtue,
virtue also attains them.

同於失者，失亦得之。
Those who align with loss,
loss also attains them.

河上公曰：与道同者，道亦乐得之。
**He Shang Gong** ["河上公"] says:
Those who align with the Dao,
the Dao also finds joy in attaining them.

与德同者，德亦乐得之。
Those who align with virtue,
virtue also finds joy in attaining them.

与失同者，失亦乐得之。
Those who align with loss,
loss also finds joy in attaining them.

信不足，有不信。
When trust is insufficient,
there is distrust.

锺会曰：我信不足於道，道亦不信应我，所以两相失。
**Zhong Hui** ["钟会"] says:
If my trust in the Dao is insufficient,
the Dao also does not trust in responding to me—
thus we mutually lose each other.

只是同於道者，道得之。
Only those who align with the Dao
are attained by the Dao.

信於道者，道信之。
Those who trust in the Dao,
the Dao trusts them.

同於失者，道失之。
Those who align with loss,
the Dao abandons them.

信不足，有不信也。
When trust is insufficient,
there is distrust.

此章以希言为主。
This chapter takes *sparse speech* ["希言"] as its central theme.

希言则以道而言也。
*Sparse speech* ["希言"] means speaking in accord with the Dao.

道偶而应，故合自然。
The Dao responds only when fitting—
thus it aligns with nature.

故下文云同於道者，道亦得之。
Thus, the following text states:
Those who align with the Dao,
the Dao also attains them.

同於失者，失亦得之。
Those who align with loss,
loss also attains them.

观其失得之本，皆言之希与多尔。
Observing the root of attaining or losing,
it is all about the sparseness or excess of speech.

多言之人，外则招愆，内则耗气，
Those who speak excessively
invite external mistakes,
and internally deplete their qi.

人欲长久，希言内守。
If one seeks to endure long,
*sparse speech* ["希言"] must be inwardly upheld.

跂者不立章第二十四 跂者不立，
**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Unestablished Do Not Stand**

The *unestablished* ["跂者"] do not stand.

跨者不行。
The *overreaching* ["跨者"] do not walk.

「To take *virtue/power* ["德"] as one’s guide,
then all who have sufficiency shall arrive.

The *unestablished* ["跂者"] are hasty to stand,
the *overreaching* ["跨者"] are hasty to walk—
both deviate from the natural way of standing and walking,
thus they cannot endure.
Hence, though they stand, they do not stand,
though they walk, they do not walk.
Those who establish their person and practice the Dao
must not seek swiftness—
to follow its natural course,
then their person stands firm and the Dao is practiced.

The *self-perceiving* ["自见者"] lack clarity—
Shu Wang says: The *self-perceiving* ["自见者"] lack clarity.
Thus, those previously called *not self-perceiving* ["不自见者"]
are the ones who see all things.

The *self-righteous* ["自是者"] are not manifest—
He Shang Gong says: Those who insist on their own correctness
and reject others’ views
are obscured by the multitude,
thus they fail to shine.

The *self-praising* ["自伐者"] achieve no merit—
Gu Xuan says: When one undertakes deeds and aids beings
yet claims the credit for oneself,
once the name is taken,
the merit lies not with the deeds.

The *self-conceited* ["自矜者"] do not grow.
Guo Xiang says: Boasting and arrogance,
not forgetting one’s own merits,
earn the disapproval of others,
thus they do not flourish.

As for the Dao,
it is said: *Excessive consumption, superfluous action* ["余食赘行"].

*Excessive consumption* ["余食"] brings illness—
*Superfluous action* ["赘行"] brings encumbrance.
Things may hate it,
thus those who embody the Dao do not dwell in it.

*Excessive consumption* ["余食"] is when one’s nature overflows—
Heaven’s deficiency, Earth’s transformation,
and the hatred of all beings.
Thus those who embody the Dao do not dwell in it.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Undivided Unity of Things**

Things are undivided in unity ["有物混成"],
born before Heaven and Earth.

*Excessive consumption* ["余食"] is when one’s nature overflows—
*Superfluous action* ["赘行"] is when one’s deeds exceed their purpose.
The Dao’s true essence stands alone,
unpaired with things,
enduring through all ages without flaw,
permanent from ancient to modern times.

It moves in cycles without depletion ["周行而不殆"],
for its use is boundless in entering and exiting,
pervading all six voids ["六虚"].
The Dao’s wondrous function
is everywhere without end,
never exhausted.

As the *Yijing* says:
*"In constant motion, it does not dwell;
flowing through the six voids,
it can be the mother of all under Heaven."*

I know not its name,
so I call it Dao.
He Shang Gong says: I do not see the form of the Dao,
so I know not how to name it—
seeing all things arise from the Dao,
thus I call it Dao.

I forcefully name it *Great* ["大"].
Tang Ming Huang says: I see things born in unity ["有物生成"],
hidden without a proper name,
so I use *pervasive birth* ["逝"] to mark its virtue,
calling it Dao—
to encompass all without limit.
Its essence is forceful,
thus it is named *Great* ["大"].

Lu Ji Fu says: The Dao as a thing,
when applied fills the boundless void ["太虚"],
yet when abandoned is nowhere to be found—
how could *Great* suffice to name it?
It is merely a forced name.

*Great* ["大"] is called *Passing* ["逝"]—
*Passing* ["逝"] means *going* ["往"].
Though all things are great,
greatness has limits and a resting place.
This Dao’s greatness passes without bounds,
its origin is beyond what can be fully grasped.

Shu Wang says: The great
though beyond the six directions ["六合"],
cannot escape its influence.
The smallest speck
cannot evade its subtlety.
Thus *Great* is called *Passing* ["逝"].

*Passing* ["逝"] is called *Far* ["远"]—
*Far* ["远"] is called *Return* ["反"].

Shu Wang says: When *Far* reaches its extreme,
it returns to the *Uncarved* ["朴"].
Thus *Far* is called *Return* ["反"].
*Return* ["反"] means returning to the origin.
When harmony is complete and fills the six voids ["六虚"],
it is called *Far* ["远"].
When near, it does not depart from oneself,
thus it is called *Return* ["反"].

*Far* ["远"] is beyond the *Unbounded* ["无极"],
endless in its extent.
*Near* ["近"] is within oneself—
humans do not perceive it.

The Dao’s essence is strong,
thus it is named *Great* ["大"].」

Thus the Dao is Great, the Heaven is Great, the Earth is Great, and the King is also Great.

*Commentary*: The Dao encompasses and sustains Heaven and Earth. Heaven covers all without limit, Earth bears all without measure, and the King stands between them, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth. Thus, the King is also Great.

The Dao encompasses all things. It wraps Heaven and Earth, vast beyond bounds, hence it is said that the Dao is Great. Heaven and Earth are the Great in form. Heaven is boundlessly broad, beyond measure, and Earth is boundlessly vast, beyond calculation. Hence, it is said that Heaven is Great and Earth is Great.

Under all Heaven, there is nothing not the King’s soil. At the edges of all lands, there is nothing not the King’s subjects. The King’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth, his Dao flows through the Three Realms ["三才"], and none surpasses the Emperor and King in greatness. Thus, the King is also Great.

Within the realm ["域"], there are four Great things, and the King occupies one of them.

*Commentary*: From the Dao descending, there arises form and substance, hence it is said that within the realm, stillness is the Dao’s, while action is the Sage’s. The King can offer tribute to the Three Realms and harmonize them, making human conduct supreme. Thus, he shares substance with the Dao and function with Heaven and Earth, and is likewise called Great. The King is the culmination of human conduct.

The Dao was never confined by boundaries, yet this passage speaks of the realm ["域"], meaning though it is confined, it wraps all things without limit.

Humans model themselves after Earth, Earth models itself after Heaven, Heaven models itself after the Dao, and the Dao models itself after Nature ["自然"].

Shu Wang says: Humans model themselves after Earth—this is the King’s greatness. Earth models itself after Heaven—this is Earth’s greatness. Heaven models itself after the Dao—this is Heaven’s greatness. The Dao models itself after Nature—this is the Dao’s greatness. For Nature ["自然"] is as if it transcends causes and conditions ["因缘"]. Neither cause nor condition, nor yet Nature. Yet the Dao’s Nature, when viewed by the self-cultivator ["自学者"], is called *Mysterious* ["妙"]. When observed by Laozi, it still retains traces of causes and conditions. Yet Laozi does not fail to grasp the Dao’s profound essence, nor does he exhaust the law within the law. Hence it is said: the Dao models itself after Nature.

Humans speak of the King. Humans model themselves after Earth’s steadfast stillness, thus without action ["无为"], all under Heaven is accomplished. Earth models itself after Heaven’s non-action, thus without growth ["不长"], all things are nourished. Heaven models itself after the Dao’s Nature, thus without giving birth ["不产"], all things transform. The Dao is self-originating, self-rooted; before Heaven and Earth existed, it endured from antiquity, having nothing to model itself after. That which has no model is simply Nature itself. Hence it is said: the Dao models itself after Nature.

This chapter speaks of the *Mixed and Complete* Dao ["混成之道"], which precedes Heaven and Earth in birth. Its substance is lofty and independent, its function flows through the six voids ["六虚"], beyond description. Though the name *Great* is applied, it is still said.

Though the Two Principles ["二仪"] are lofty and profound, and the King’s authority is supreme, all defer to the Dao.

The Dao is self-originating, self-rooted, without causes or conditions, yet naturally so.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as the Root of the Light**

The heavy is the root of the light,
the still is the master of the restless.

River Upper Master ["河上公"] says: If the sovereign does not hold weight ["重"], he will not be revered. If governing the body does not hold weight, the spirit will be lost. Grass and trees, leaves and flowers are light, hence they wither and fall. The root is heavy, hence it endures long.

If the sovereign is not still, his authority will be lost; if governing the body is not still, the body will be in peril. The dragon is still, hence it can transform and vary. The tiger is restless, hence it is cut down prematurely.

Lü Jifu ["吕吉甫"] says: The light is first to respond ["先感"], the heavy is last to react ["后应"]. That which reacts is born from what responds, hence the heavy is the root of the light.

The still governs things ["役物"], the restless is governed by things ["役於物"]. The restless is often governed by the still, hence the still is the master of the restless.

Liu Zhongping ["刘仲平"] says: The light arises from the heavy, hence the heavy is the root of the light. The restless arises from stillness, hence the still is the master of the restless.

Thus the virtuous person ["君子"] walks all day without straying from his burden ["辎重"]. Though he has splendid views ["荣观"], his repose ["燕处"] is serene and detached.

*Commentary*: Splendid views are in things ["物"], repose is in the self ["身"]. Only when the self is at ease can things bring joy. Walking is swift with lightness, yet one cannot walk without a burden. Observing is glorious with restlessness, yet one cannot observe without repose. Having the burden of the burdened, yet not hindered in the Dao, then one can walk. Having the repose of repose, yet serene and self-sufficient, then one can observe. Hence it is said: the heavy is the root of the light, the still is the master of the restless.

How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots ["万乘之主"] bear a light body ["身轻"] while weighing the world ["天下"]?

Lü Jifu ["吕吉甫"] says: Even the virtuous person’s daily walk and his splendid views are thus, how much more the ruler of ten thousand chariots, bearing heavy burdens ["任重"] and traveling distant roads ["道远"], surveying all under Heaven ["观天下"]—can he not be still and heavy?

Forced to move, then he reacts ["动"].
Sensate and then he responds ["感"].
Unable to help himself, then he rises ["起"]—
this is the heavy.

Without action ["无为"], then he is still ["静"].
If his movement is always at the point of compulsion ["得已"], and he cannot be without action, then he bears a light body while weighing the world, yet is not heavy. Not heavy, then he is restless, and not still.

Lu Tian ["陆佃"] says: All under Heaven ["天下"] is the sovereign’s burden and also his repose—what cannot be separated.

Thus it is said: How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots bear a light body while weighing the world? Lightness will lose his subjects ["臣"], restlessness will lose his authority ["君"].

*Commentary*: Not heavy, then he lacks authority ["威"], hence he loses his subjects. If he does not lead yet seeks harmony ["不唱而和"], he violates proper order ["犯分"], hence he loses his authority.

Lu Tian ["陆佃"] says: The heavy is the sovereign’s virtue ["德"], the still is the subject’s conduct ["道"].

Song Lingxian ["松灵仙"] says: If the heart is in turmoil ["动乱"], it will harm the *Mysterious Spirit* ["妙神"]. The spirit is the sovereign ["神即君也"]. This chapter warns the sovereign to take stillness and weight as his foundation.

All under Heaven ["天下"] is the sovereign’s stillness and weight. How can it be lightened with one’s own body?

Those who cultivate the True ["修真之士"] also take stillness and weight as their foundation: they weigh their body yet do not burden it with things ["不以物累形"], they still their heart yet do not let things disturb their spirit ["不以物乱神"]. Body intact, spirit settled—this is the Dao’s completeness ["全"].

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Good Way**

The good way leaves no tracks ["无辙迹"].

Shu Wang ["舒王"] says: The good way does not hasten ["不疾"], yet is swift ["速"]. The bad way does not move ["不行"], yet arrives ["至"]. Thus it is said.

「Thus, there are no tracks.

Lu Yu says: To act in accordance with the Dao, one’s traces do not differ from things, hence there are no tracks.

Zhong Hui says: The practitioner of the good way has no visible achievements in virtue and name.

Su Ziyou says: To ride upon principle and act leaves no traces. A carriage moves and leaves tracks, a lone traveler leaves footprints—so action indeed cannot lack traces. Yet the practitioner of the good way seeks it within oneself without stepping beyond one’s courtyard; their action emerges from non-action, hence there are no tracks—this is what is meant by "non-action yet arrival."

The good speech has no flaws or censure;

Du Guangting says: The practitioner of good speech attains the meaning and forgets the words.
Thus, there is no disease of blemishes or offense of reproach.

Lü Jifu says: The wise do not speak, and those who speak lack wisdom.
So speech indeed cannot lack flaws or censure.
To know why one speaks, speech arises from non-speech—hence it is said: The good speech has no flaws or censure.

The good plan requires no calculations or reckoning;
The Imperial Commentary says: To understand unity, all affairs are completed—how much more so for what is not mere numbers! Thus, without using calculations or reckoning, one adapts to myriad changes as though counting one and two.

The good closure needs no bolts or bars yet cannot be opened;
Shu Wang says: The practitioner of good closure allows no thing to enter through its gate, hence there are no bolts or bars yet it cannot be opened.
Wen Gong says: A well-governed state does not rely on the natural barriers of mountains and rivers.
The nine orifices are the gates of spirit and vitality.
The practitioner of good closure guards their spirit internally, preventing it from dissipating outward.
Though internally there may be no bolts or bars, how could it be opened?

The good binding needs no cords or constraints yet cannot be undone;
Gu Xuan says: To bind with the Dao, though lacking cords, it is self-secured. To bind with things, though having constraints, it is not firm.
Thus, to constrain others with coercive force, even three armies may desert.
To bind with the Dao, even a single man’s resolve is hard to seize.
Wen Gong says: To confine the people, one does not rely on the boundaries of sealed borders.
Du Guangting says: The practitioner of good conduct forgets all concerns, with no second thought; their stillness aligns with the Dao, merging with the True.
Not even myriad green things can encroach, nor all temptations seduce—this is called good binding, how could it be undone?

Therefore, the Sage always practices good rescue, hence there are none abandoned.
Cai Zihuang says: To benefit others is good.
Hong Ji says: To rescue all beings in the ten directions, one must first establish their own land.
The flow of good is ever enveloped in mystery, its blessings evenly spread, nurturing all life, returning to the Dao’s source.
The vulgar and deceitful, Emperor Shun taught them yet did not abandon.
The empty and foolish, Confucius exhausted all explanations.
Always practicing good rescue, there are none abandoned.

The Imperial Commentary says: Good is the Dao’s continuation in the unseen.
The Dao itself cannot be named as good.
When good is named and established, the Dao departs and good becomes the world.
The Sage embodies the Dao to benefit All-Under-Heaven, hence these five goods.
Yet, in the case of people and things, none are abandoned.

However, the Sage’s way of loving people and benefiting things, letting them fulfill their nature while humans find joy in theirs, is not arbitrary.
To invert unity is to lose the Dao; to cling to the constant yet neglect the Dao is to abandon its path.
All-Under-Heaven has lost its tranquil, still, and ever-present nature, daily sinking into the realm of sorrow and peril—who but the Sage could rescue them?

The *New Sayings* state: All things have their natural principles; indeed, there are those who defy and reverse them.
All things have their inherent nature; indeed, there are those who violate and shackle it.
All things have their proper fate; indeed, there are those who oppose and sever it.
The Sage, moved with compassion, thus employs their treasured virtue to rescue them.
To those who defy principle, they open what is blocked and make clear.
To those who violate nature, they remove what is harmful and bring ease.
To those who oppose fate, they restore what is severed and revive it.
This is called "inheriting clarity."

The Imperial Commentary says: To inherit is to reveal without display.
To inherit clarity is to shine without blinding.

Lü Jifu says: These five aspects—principle, nature, fate, and their shared essence—are what the Sage understands through constant wisdom, rescuing at the moment of shared truth.
Though they act, speak, plan, close, or bind, none know how it is done—
inherited clarity cannot be seen directly.
Hence it is said: This is called inheriting clarity.

Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good.
The not-good person is the resource of the good.
The Imperial Commentary says: Resource refers to what is useful; there are not-good people.
Only then does one know good as beneficial.

Shu Wang says: The good person teaches the not-good.
Hence, the good person is the teacher of the not-good.
Without the not-good, one would not know good as good.
Hence, the not-good person is the resource of the good.
To not honor one’s teacher is to not cherish one’s resource.

Su Ziyou says: The Sage has no personal intent in teaching, hence does not cherish their resource.
All-Under-Heaven has no intent in learning, hence does not honor their teacher.
The Sage does not merely forget All-Under-Heaven; they also make All-Under-Heaven forget them.

Liezi, taught by Laozi, befriended Boyi, and attained the Way of the Immortal Wind.
After nine years, he also did not recognize his master as his teacher nor his friend as his friend—
his inner and outer progress was complete.
This is called not honoring one’s teacher.
Confucius, upon meeting Lord Shang of Yin, then declined further association and dismissed his disciples—
this is called not cherishing one’s resource.
Though knowing the great confusion, it is called the ultimate mystery.

The Imperial Commentary says: The Dao’s ultimate mystery lies in not perceiving the myriad goods,
having no need for cleverness or calculation.
The Seven Sages were all in confusion, yet none questioned their path—
this meaning converges here.

Li Zhan says: This chapter speaks of the Sage’s subtle and hidden use of virtue,
whose manifestations are imperceptible.
Though it is said they always practice good,
the mystery lies in their simultaneous forgetting—
thus they can teach and speak.
What they do not explain through intricate reasoning
has no means of reckoning or tracing.
This is the good teacher and resource as a path for gradual cultivation,
cutting off all attachment to enter the gate of sudden enlightenment,
aligning with inherited clarity to rescue all things.»

**The Daoist Canon: *Taking the Good* (Volume 5) – Collected Commentaries of Song Resident Scholar Li Lin**

**Chapter 28: Knowing the Heroic, Holding the Feminine**

Know its heroic, hold its feminine.

Du Guangting says: In the Upper Clarity Dao, there is the method of the One Feminine, and also the Three Chases and Five Feminines—all softening the will, harmonizing the spirit, to attain longevity.

It becomes the valley of all under Heaven.

Wang Yuanzhe says: A valley receives and channels all flowing waters. To hold the feminine is to remain in emptiness and stillness, receiving all things without obstruction, hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.

The heroic moves, the feminine is still. The Perfect One knows its movement yet does not follow it, always holding stillness without abandoning the True. Thus, it is said to be the valley below.

The Dao comes and returns to me like water flowing into a deep valley, hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.

It becomes the valley of all under Heaven, its constant virtue never departing.

Lü Jifu says: A valley receives from the ravine and delivers to the rivers and seas—receiving without resistance, delivering without accumulation. It is the thing that flows through without obstruction.

To flow through is to have constant virtue never departing.

Wang Yuanzhe says: Constant virtue is fixed and unchanging within me. "Not departing" means it remains within its nature, internal and not external.

It returns to the infant.

Wang Yuanzhe says: The infant holds harmony and unity, with no desires or thoughts yet formed. Its nature is pure and undispersed, its virtue profound—thus it aligns with the original.

Such is worthy of the name Great.

Mencius said: The Great Person does not lose the heart of the infant.

The feminine governs gentleness and stillness.

The infant’s bones are weak, its sinews soft; its *qi* is not violent, its desires and thoughts not yet formed. Its virtue is unchanging—this is the depth of contained virtue, like the infant’s purity.

Know its white, hold its black.

Wang Yuanzhe says: Black is the color of the North, where stillness cannot be fully described. The Sage establishes all things; without holding black, there is no foundation. This is verified by the emergence of spring and summer from the dark winter.

It becomes the model of all under Heaven.

Lü Jifu says: White, in color, is receptive; in things, it is brightness; in action, it is metal; in numbers, it is four. Black, in color, is untainted; in things, it is obscurity; in action, it is water; in numbers, it is one.

To know white and hold black is to receive no taint from all things. Like obscurity, like water, it ultimately embraces the One. Embracing the One, it can bend and yield, sink and be depleted—thus it can be the model of all under Heaven.

White is clarity, untouched by things. Black is silent stillness, in numbers the One.

The Perfect One knows its clarity yet holds silent stillness in the One. All under Heaven follows and emulates this, hence it is the model of all under Heaven.

It becomes the model of all under Heaven, its constant virtue never erring.

Lü Jifu says: To be the model of all under Heaven is to be One in all things, thus its constant virtue never errs.

"Not departing" means it does not stray from its original place, yet this does not guarantee it will not err. To not err is to not deviate.

It returns to the Boundless.

Lü Jifu says: The infant is a thing that focuses *qi* and softens, preserving its unity without loss.

To return to the Boundless, the infant is insufficient to describe it.

Luóshī says: *Tè* means to fail or lose. If one abandons wisdom and holds foolishness, acts in accord with spontaneity, and virtue aligns with action, becoming the model for all things—manifesting in action yet returning to the Dao—since the Dao is inexhaustible, it attains the Boundless.

One is the Boundless of wisdom, two is the Boundless of life.

Know its glory, hold its humiliation.

Du Guangting says: Glory is exalted honor. Humiliation is lowly shame. A ruler possesses the eight extremes, dominating the nine boundaries—this is exalted honor. To call oneself "lonely," "widowed," or "not-grain" is lowly shame.

It becomes the valley of all under Heaven.

Shū Wáng says: To know glory and hold humiliation is to guard with humility and respond well, hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.

It becomes the valley of all under Heaven, its constant virtue now complete.

Liu Zhongping says: A valley can be empty and responsive, contain and receive—thus its constant virtue is complete.

It returns to the Uncarved.

Su Shiru says: Not knowing yet not acting is inferior to knowing yet not acting to the utmost.

To know the heroic and hold the feminine is to know nature. To know white and hold black is to see nature. To know glory and hold humiliation is to restore nature.

When all delusions are exhausted, dwelling in humiliation without regret, vast like the emptiness of a valley—things come and it responds—virtue is complete here, pure nature without mixture.

Thus it is said: It returns to the Uncarved.

Sōnglíng Xiān says: *Zú* means sufficiency. *Fù* is return. *Pǔ* is the true origin.

At first, knowing the heroic ends with holding humiliation.

The three practices of holding humiliation are complete as the essence of the Dao. Like an empty valley with nothing to contain, this is how constant virtue attains supreme virtue, thus it returns to true emptiness, merging with the Dao. Hence it is said: It returns to the Uncarved.

Grasses and trees flourish as glory, wither as humiliation. What makes humans glory or humiliation is no different.

The Perfect One knows glory yet does not dwell in it, discards ornamentation and returns to the root, always holding humiliation—dwelling in what others despise, unburdened, for it is empty. Hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.

The valley is empty and receives, responds yet does not hoard. Virtue reaches this peak—exhausted, beyond addition.

Thus it is said: Its constant virtue is complete.

The Uncarved is the complete body of the Dao. To return to the Uncarved is to fully embody the Dao.

The titles "lonely," "widowed," "not-grain" are used by kings and dukes, hence embracing the Uncarved, all under Heaven returns. To return to the Uncarved is beyond the Boundless—this is the nameless Uncarved.

The Uncarved, though small, none under Heaven can subdue it.
Thus, to guard the female, guard the dark, guard humiliation is sufficient.
Why bother knowing the male, the white, or the glory?

To guard is to hold the Dao as mother;
To know is to grasp it as child.
To guard is to uphold the constant;
To know is to embrace the change.

The Uncarved disperses into vessels.
**Commentary:** That which transcends form is called the Dao; that which falls under form is called vessels.
Vessels are the dispersion of the Dao.
They have shape and name, they have division and governance—
Use them according to their purpose.

**Zhuangzi’s Disciple Zhong Hui said:**
The Uncarved is the Dao.
To guard it is the Dao of sincerity;
To disperse it is the vessel nurturing humanity.

The Sage employs it,
And thus becomes the ruler and the official.
**Commentary:** The fullness of the Dao,
The Sage uses to govern himself.
Its dispersion,
The Sage uses to benefit all under Heaven.

With form to be named,
With division to be governed—
Thus, he assigns roles and orders attributes,
And all under Heaven is harmonized—this is called the ruler and the official.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
Know the subtle, know the manifest,
Know the soft, know the hard.
The expectation of ten thousand men,
Is of the same meaning.

**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:**
When virtue is contained and internally harmonized, it returns to the Uncarved.
When constant virtue is applied, it disperses into vessels.
Once involved in form and vessels,
There must be refinement and coarseness—
Thus, the Sage employs them,
And becomes the ruler of the common folk.

Hence, the great governance does not sever.

**Su Shi said:**
The Sage, having returned to the Uncarved,
Then disperses the Uncarved into vessels,
To respond to all things—
Like a sovereign dividing authority,
To establish rulers and officials,
Also following the natural course of affairs,
Though governed, there is no severing or fragmentation.

**Cao Daochong said:**
The greatest of institutions
Lacks any trace of severing or fragmentation.
From this chapter’s meaning,
Constant virtue is the root—
If one guards its constancy,
Then knowing it must be its change.

Thus, knowing the male yet guarding the female,
Its virtue does not stray;
Knowing the white yet guarding the dark,
Its virtue does not falter;
Knowing the glory yet guarding the humiliation,
Its virtue is complete—
To this point, it is not false,
But simply returns to the state of infancy.

With no end, it shares the same body as the Dao.

The Dao endures through antiquity and the present, always existing.
Virtue aligns with the Dao—
This is what is called the constant.

This is the true Dao for governing oneself;
The rest, for benefiting all under Heaven,
Each follows its own capacity in use.

Hence it is said: The great governance does not sever.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: On the Will to Govern**

When one is about to take all under Heaven and act upon it,
I see it as something he cannot avoid.

**Zang Xuanjing said:**
"Will" is the act of willing;
"To govern" is the act of forcing—
When one is about to force and willing,
He takes all under Heaven by might,
And governs it with contrivance.

**Wang Yuanzhe said:**
"Take" is to take things as if they were his own.
"Govern" is to contrive and act as if he were the maker.
Those who have themselves and contrive,
Are still caught between worry and peril—
How can they have leisure to govern others?

**Su Shi said:**
The Sage’s possession of all under Heaven
Is not a taking.
All things return to him,
And he receives them as unavoidable.
His governance of all under Heaven
Is not a contriving.
He follows the natural course of all things,
And only removes their harm.

To take and govern is impossible.
The world is a divine vessel—
**Commentary:** It is constrained by form and number,
Bound by square and round,
And confined within the expanse of the heavens and earth.
It stands in the unfathomable,
Acts without fixed direction.
To govern it leads to ruin,
To grasp it leads to loss—
Thus it is called the divine vessel.

To rule all things,
To command all movement,
There must be those who are not vessels—
Only then can all under Heaven be governed.
Hence it is said:
The ruler must act without contrivance,
Yet employ all under Heaven.

**Zhuangzi said:**
The Dao of Heaven wandered in the Yin Yang,
Reached the upper reaches of the Leaving Waters,
And encountered a nameless man,
Whom he questioned, saying:
"May I ask about governing all under Heaven?"
The nameless man said:
"Go! Why should a vulgar man like you ask about that which is not fitting?
To govern is to ruin,
To grasp is to lose."

**Wen Gong said:**
To govern is to harm the natural;
To grasp is to obstruct the flow of change.
The world is a divine and luminous vessel—
It cannot be forced by might,
Nor can it be rigidly grasped.
All things have nature as their essence,
Thus it can be followed yet not governed,
It can be guided yet not rigidly grasped.
To contrive against their constant nature,
Thus it must lead to ruin.
To grasp their coming and going,
Thus it must lead to loss.

Hence, things sometimes move forward,
And sometimes follow behind—
Like form and shadow never parting.
Sometimes warm to bring heat,
And sometimes cold to bring chill—
Like the seasons generating each other.
Knowing strength alone,
Then weakness and infirmity must come at times.
Knowing flourishing alone,
Then decline and destruction must follow at hand.

These are all the great emotions of creation,
The daily states of morning and evening,
The interplay of events and circumstances—
It cannot be otherwise.

Then how can one govern and grasp it?

Thus, the Sage avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance,
Avoids arrogance.

**He Shang Gong said:**
Excess refers to indulging in food, sound, and color;
Extravagance refers to clothing, adornment, and drink;
Arrogance refers to palaces, halls, and pavilions.

Go beyond these three [excesses], dwell in moderation and act without contriving—
then the world will transform itself naturally.

**Lu Tian** said:
The Sage, regarding the world,
follows its course without forcing,
trusts its unfolding without grasping—
thus he avoids excess through kindness,
avoids extravagance through frugality,
avoids arrogance by never presuming to lead the world.
These three are how one attains the world.

This chapter speaks of how the world cannot be seized by force,
cannot be taken by contrivance.
If one were to forcefully seize it,
how could one know the Sage acts only when compelled?
If one governs by contriving,
how could one know the Sage’s way of ruling without contriving?

Thus, those who act contrive will fail,
those who grasp will lose.
Therefore, the Sage understands the reversals of the Eight Laws,
avoids the excesses of the Three Matters,
and thus the nation’s fate extends long,
and self-cultivation brings enduring life and vision.

**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao**

To assist the sovereign with the Dao means
not to coerce the world with arms—
for such deeds return ill.

**Su Ziyou** said:
The Sage uses arms only when compelled,
not to force victory over the world.
Though victory may be won,
the calamity will return to haunt them.

The kings of Chu, Qi, Qin, and Han’s Emperor Wu—
some perished themselves,
some brought ruin to their descendants.
What men abhor,
what ghosts detest—
none escaped.

Great ministers serve the ruler with the Dao.
If they coerce the world with arms,
they assist the ruler with what is not his way.

To assist the sovereign with the Dao is already to refrain
from coercing the world with arms—
how much more so if the ruler himself embodies the Dao?
The reason is that such deeds invite retribution.

To subdue the world with the Dao,
then the world dares not disobey.
But if one raises arms against them,
those who kill their fathers will have their fathers killed,
those who kill their brothers will have their brothers killed—
as the saying goes: *"What you send forth returns to you."*

Where armies march, thorns and brambles grow.
After great armies, there are years of famine.
**Commentary:**
The lower classes are drained of strength—
thus thorns and brambles grow.
The upper classes defy the natural order—
thus there are years of famine.
*The Odes* say:
*"Soothing the myriad states brings abundant harvests."*
Soothing the myriad states brings harmony among people,
and harmony among people invites the harmony of Heaven and Earth.
When farming is neglected and fields left untended,
thorns and brambles grow.
When slaughter is excessive and *he qi* is injured,
there must be calamities from Heaven.
Neglect of farming precedes disaster,
and disaster follows—
there will surely be years of famine.
Thus, the virtuous achieve victory without force,
daring not to seize through strength.

**Lü Jifu** said:
*"Victory"* refers to defeating the enemy.
When the enemy is defeated,
the attackers lament their own ruin—
as in *"Zhòu attacks, and I lament from Bó"*—
this is called victory.
It arises from compulsion, not from seeking force.
*"Victory"* is the word for triumph.
Tang conquered Xia yet spoke of shameful virtue,
returned to Bó yet feared the precipice.
Victory without pride,
victory without boasting,
victory without arrogance,
victory born of compulsion—
this is victory without force.

**Chang Jifu** said:
Victory without pride in one’s ability,
victory without boasting of one’s deeds,
victory without arrogance in one’s power—
victory that always arises from compulsion—
this is the way of victory without force.
If one prides in ability,
boasts of deeds,
arrogates power,
then this is victory through force,
not victory born of compulsion.

**Things flourish then grow old,**
**Wang Yuanzhe** said:
The extreme leads to decline—
this is the inevitable nature of things.
In antiquity, those who met this fate were the Qin.

Things grow strong through reliance on arms.
Things flourish then decline,
arms grow strong then fail.
This is called *not-Dao*.
**Commentary:**
The Dao has no fixed beginning or end,
it does not align with the transformations of things.

**Wang Yuanzhe** said:
Those who embody the Dao
encompass all changes without dwelling in any single thing—
thus they have no thought of flourishing or decline.
*Not-Dao* perishes early.

**Lü Jifu** said:
All things wax then wane—
this is their nature.
The Dao values endurance,
softness as strength—
this is how one persists without peril.
If one relies on arms to coerce the world,
it is to abandon softness for strength.
Strength must decline,
and thus it is merely things—
how could this be the Dao’s way of transforming things?

Thus it is said:
*"Things flourish then grow old—
this is called not-Dao,
not-Dao perishes early."*
The Dao endures above antiquity without aging.
Those who attain the Dao can repel aging and preserve their form—
aging is *not-Dao*.
Just as arms grow strong then fail—
how could this align with the Dao?
Since it does not align with the Dao,
how could it endure?
Thus it is said: *"Perishes early."*

This chapter warns ministers:
to assist the ruler with the Dao,
one must not coerce the world with arms.
The Dao values soft persuasion,
not coercion through arms.
If one coerces the world to victory,
it is like things flourishing then declining—
how could this be the Dao?

**Chapter Thirty-One: Fine Arms**

Fine arms are an inauspicious instrument.
**Wen Gong** said:
The finer the arms, the greater the harm done.

**Zuan Wei** said:
Those who adorn spears, armor, and helmets as ornaments
revere what is not a benevolent instrument.
*"Fine"* means adorned,
*"auspicious"* means good.
Fine arms are strong armor and sharp blades.
Arms are a cruel instrument—
thus they should not be adorned.
Things may abhor them,
so those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.

**Commentary:**
Auspicious matters bring good fortune.
Arms are a cruel instrument—
thus they are called inauspicious.
When arms are stored yet mobilized in season,
those who follow the Dao display virtue without showing arms,
thus they do not dwell upon them.

**Shu Wang** said:
Fine arms are strong armor and sharp blades—
arms are a cruel instrument,
thus they are called an inauspicious instrument.
The previous chapter has already explained this in detail:
no thing escapes their cruel harm,
thus they are abhorred.

Those who follow the Dao take compassion as their heart, thus they do not dwell upon arms.

Arms are a cruel instrument.
When mobilized, all things abhor them—
thus those who follow the Dao must never dwell upon them.

The virtuous in peace honor the left,
in war honor the right.

**Gu Huān** said:
The left is Yang.
Yang is the Way of life, thus in peace it is honored.
The right is Yin.
Yin is the Way of killing, thus in war it is honored.

Arms are an inauspicious instrument,
not the instrument of the virtuous.

**御注:**
The left is Yang and governs life,
the right is Yin and governs killing.
Yang is virtue, Yin is punishment—
the virtuous honor virtue and fear punishment,
thus it is said: not the instrument of the virtuous.

**Wang Yuanzé** said:
To rule the realm is to act without action,
to govern the people is with compassion and benevolence—
thus arms are not revered.
When forced to use them,

**Zhuān Wēi** said:
One does not dare to be the aggressor but only the defender,
one does not dare to advance an inch but retreats a foot—
all are acts of necessity.

The skilled in arms respond only when provoked,
act only when pressed—
always arising from necessity.

Calm and still is the highest virtue.
To win without delighting in it,

**御注:**
To suppress tyranny and rescue chaos,
to act only when forced—
thus it is done out of necessity.
With no desire to conquer others,
it is said that calm and still is the highest virtue.
With no desire to conquer others,
arms are not a source of joy—
thus they are not delightful.

**Chéng Xuányīng** said:
Calm and still is non-action.
The virtuous heart cherishes non-action,
thus though arms are used,
they are not considered delightful.

**Zhang Jūnxiàng** said:
Calm is without disorder.
Still is a tranquil heart.
Calm and still is the Dao.
To hold the Dao as highest—
how could one delight in arms?

Those who delight in them
are those who take pleasure in killing.

**Wang Yuanzé** said:
Arms are meant for slaughter and destruction,
yet to adorn them excessively,
to make them beautiful and pleasing to behold—
this is to take pleasure in killing.
If one delights in arms,
then one delights in sending people to their deaths.

Those who take pleasure in killing
cannot achieve their desires in the world.

**Zhuān Wēi** said:
The cruel and violent who delight in killing
cannot be allowed to achieve their desires in the world.
If they do, they defy Heaven’s virtue,
unleashing slaughter at will,
treating the people as grass and chaff—
how could Heaven aid them?
If Heaven does not aid them,
how could they achieve their desires?

Those who take pleasure in killing
must not be allowed to achieve their desires in the world.
As rulers, one must not arbitrarily execute.
This is what Mencius meant by:
*"Only those who do not delight in killing can unite the people."*

Auspicious matters honor the left,
inauspicious matters honor the right.

**Chéng Xuányīng** said:
Auspicious refers to morning rites,
inauspicious refers to funeral rites.

**Hé Shànggōng** said:
The left is Yang, governing life,
the right is Yin, governing killing.
The General of the Left Wing is stationed on the left,
the General of the Right Wing on the right.

**Hé Shànggōng** said:
The General of the Left Wing is lowly yet occupies the Yang position,
for he does not wield killing alone.
The General of the Right Wing is exalted yet occupies the Yin position,
for he alone commands killing.
This is treated as funeral rites.

The momentum of war
places the right in the superior position—
thus it is treated as funeral rites.
When many are slain,
one mourns them with tears.

**Cáo Dàochōng** said:
All under Heaven are the ruler’s people—
by their obedience or defiance,
some are killed in great numbers—
thus one weeps and grieves for them.

**Yánggù** said:
It is made clear that this is not a delight.

When victorious in battle,
one treats it as funeral rites.

**御注:**
The *Yì* calls the army a poison to the world—
though victorious in battle,
there will always be those harmed by its poison,
thus the superior position is given to mourning,
as if the victor were in funeral rites.

**Hé Shànggōng** said:
In ancient times, when victorious in battle,
the general occupied the position of the funeral master,
wearing plain mourning garments and weeping.

The virtuous honor virtue and despise arms,
using them only when forced to punish inauspiciousness—
their hearts grieve as if in mourning.

**Lǚ Jífǔ** said:
To treat victory as funeral rites
makes it clear that arms are inauspicious
and not delightful.
To mourn with tears
makes it clear that one does not delight in killing.

**Lǐ Tián** said:
This chapter states that the virtuous should take morality as their village instrument,
not war and conquest as their achievements.
If one delights in arms and strength,
then killing will follow.
If not for funeral rites,
there would be no way to treat it.

---
**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Ever Nameless**

The Dao ever nameless.

**Wang Bì** said:
The Dao has no form,
thus it cannot be named.
To be ever nameless is its constant—
thus it is said: the Dao ever nameless.

**Liú Zhòngpíng** said:
"Constant" refers to an eternal, unchanging designation.
The height of Heaven,
the depth of Earth,
the brilliance of the sun and moon—
though great in nurturing life,
they endure through the ages,
yet are not ultimately unchangeable.
Their forms appear above—
thus I may call them *Qián*.
Their patterns manifest below—
thus I may call them *Kūn*.
Thus, the luminous symbols descending—
I may call them sun and moon.
These three are not beyond what I name,
thus they are not nameless.

But the Dao—
its ebb and flow, its fullness and emptiness,
faint and insubstantial,
yet not in communion with anything.
Ancient and modern succeed one another in the boundless,
as if naturally self-aware.
Neither Yin nor Yang,
neither soft nor hard,
neither small nor great,
neither round nor square,
neither white nor black,
neither *gōng* nor *shāng*—
seen, yet unseen,
heard, yet unheard,
grasped, yet unattainable—
this is called the ever nameless constant.

Though crude and seemingly small,
the world does not dare to enslave it.

**Hé Shànggōng** said:
Though the Dao is crude and small,
subtle and formless,
the world does not dare to enslave those who follow it.
Crude is the complete essence of the Dao,
before anything began.
Though small, it suffices as sovereign over all things.
If kings and lords could guard it,
all things would willingly submit.

「Lǚ Jífǔ said:
Why does the Dao/Way endow all beings with their beginning,
and why do all things rely on it to be born?
Then, who in the world would dare to enslave their own origin and their own source of life?

This is called the **true sovereign**.
All things possess a true sovereign—
this is what it means.

If kings and lords could guard it,
then they would rule all things with the true sovereign,
and who would there be among all things
that obtained the true sovereign yet did not submit?

The Dao/Way is the master of all things.
If kings and lords uphold it,
then without resorting to coercive force or incentives of reward,
things would not know how, yet they would willingly submit.

The heavens and earth unite,
and sweet dew descends.
No one commands it,
yet all is balanced.

**Imperial Annotation**:
The pure and undifferentiated Dao/Way,
guarded without loss,
not only ensures that all things submit,
but also that it reaches the heavens above
and coils beneath the earth below,
flowing in harmony with the heavens and earth—
thus, all things are interconnected and unified,
and all are nourished by its grace.

Sweet dew is the harmonious *qi* of the heavens and earth.
*The Classic of Changes* says:
The virtue/power of emperors and kings,
ascends to the **Tàiqīng** (Supreme Clarity),
descends to the **Tàiníng** (Supreme Tranquility),
and permeates all living beings—
then sweet dew descends.

**Wang Yuanzé** said:
If one guards the nameless essence of the Dao/Way
as the foundation of governance,
then the rising and falling of Yin and Yang
will proceed according to their natural order,
and the harmonious *qi* will respond accordingly.

Sweet dew is the product of Yin and Yang’s mutual harmony,
naturally and evenly bestowed
without any need for command—
it is the Dao/Way’s influence,
reaching everywhere without fail.

**Mencius** said:
To flow in harmony with the heavens and earth above and below—
is this not the way of the Dao/Way?
This is what it means.

These two interpretations explain
how kings and lords, if they guard the Dao/Way,
will see the heavens descend sweet dew as an auspicious sign.

**Wang Bì** said:
When the heavens and earth unite,
sweet dew descends without being sought.
If I guard its true nature and take no action,
then the people will not be commanded yet will be balanced.

**Wén Gōng** said:
Kings and lords who guard the Dao/Way
will see things submit,
*qi* harmonize,
and the people transform.

**Lǚ Jífǔ** said:
The utmost Yin is solemn and still,
the utmost Yang is radiant and vast—
the solemn arises from the heavens,
the radiant emerges from the earth.
When these two interact,
harmony is formed and things are born.

It is called the **measure** (*jì*), yet no one sees its form.
When the heavens and earth unite to descend sweet dew,
this is the peak of harmony.
Kings and lords wield the Dao/Way,
and all things submit to it—
that is all there is to it.
Who can truly see its form?

Thus, no one commands it,
yet all is balanced.

**Sū Zǐyóu** said:
The undifferentiated *qi* ascends and descends,
uniting to form one—
and sweet dew descends,
wetting all things uniformly without exception.

The sage embodies the utmost Dao/Way
to respond to all existence,
just as sweet dew reaches everywhere—
this is how they can govern all things.

These four interpretations explain
how the sage embodies the Dao/Way,
and all things submit to it,
just as sweet dew reaches everywhere.

At first, the Dao/Way was nameless.
Once names were established,
then one would also know where to stop.

To know where to stop
is the means of avoiding peril.

**Cài Zǐhuǎng** said:
If one knows where to stop,
returning from the end of named things
to the root of the nameless,
then one neither dies nor lives—
this is the way of avoiding peril.

Named things are the scattered manifestations of the Dao/Way.
When names were first established,
one should immediately know where to stop,
and return to the nameless essence of the Dao/Way—
then one will not follow things’ transformations,
calmly self-sufficient,
and free from all peril.

It is like the Dao/Way’s presence in the world,
comparable to streams and valleys converging with rivers and seas.

**Imperial Annotation**:
The world is of one nature.
The Dao/Way’s presence in the world
unites through nature,
just as streams and valleys gather with rivers and seas
through water.
Those of the same nature are drawn to it,
those of the same kind respond to it—
what need has the sage of governing?
They simply follow nature.

**Lù Yù** said:
Streams and valleys return to the sea,
yet the sea does not summon them.
The people return to the Dao/Way,
yet the Dao/Way does not contrive to gather them.

**Wang Yuanzé** said:
Rivers and seas do not seek water to return to them,
because they are the **reservoir** (*zhōng*).
When water accumulates in abundance,
those with the same nature go to it.
The Dao/Way is the nature of the people.
If the sage gathers its purity and completeness,
then all living beings will submit to it,
for this is their nature.

**Sū Zǐyóu** said:
Rivers and seas are the reservoir of water.
Streams and valleys are its divisions.
The Dao/Way is the **origin** (*zōng*) of all things.
All things are its branches.
All are water,
so streams and valleys return to their reservoir.
All are the Dao/Way,
so all things submit to their origin.

This chapter speaks of kings and lords
guarding the Dao/Way,
and all things submitting to them,
just as the heavens descend sweet dew,
and all is balanced without command.

The Dao/Way is what all people share,
the same nature they all possess.
Kings and lords first grasp
what all people share in nature—
then the world will not submit to them,
yet they will go to it,
just as water returns to the sea,
naturally and without effort.

**Chapter Thirty-Three on Knowing People**:
To know people is wisdom—」

**Chapter Thirty-Three on Knowing People** (continued):

「The **Commentary** says: Wisdom is like the eye—
able to see a hundred paces distant yet unable to perceive its own lashes.
To discern the crooked and straight in others,
as clear as distinguishing white from black,
is the work of wisdom—
to know people alone.
To know oneself is **enlightenment** (*míng*).

The **Commentary** says: *"Returning to know oneself"* (*fù yǐ zì zhī*).
The **Commentary** says: *"Inner vision"* (*nèi shì*) is called enlightenment.

Wisdom in knowing others
leads to conflict with those you meet,
daily battling with the heart.
But returning to know oneself
is to remain still and reflect upon the **root** (*běn*),
to perceive oneself alone.
The **balance** (*yíng*) of Heaven and Earth,
the **mirror** (*jìng*) of all things.

Duke Wen of Song said: *"Self-knowledge and self-mastery are especially difficult."*

Master He Shang said: *"When a person can know their own worth—whether virtuous or otherwise—
this is called *receptive listening without sound* (*fǎn tīng wú shēng*), *inner vision without form* (*nèi shì wú xíng*).
Thus, they attain enlightenment."*

Chéng Xuán Yīng said: *"To illuminate and discern the realms before one,
to mirror others—
whether their nature is vast or shallow,
whether their understanding is deep or shallow—
this is wisdom.
To know one’s own destiny,
the retribution of good and evil across the three ages (*sān shì*),
without any obscurity—
this is enlightenment.
The **Scripture** speaks of *seeing the subtle as enlightenment* (*jiàn xiǎo yuē míng*).
The subtle refers to the **Dao/Way’s** subtle essence.
Again, *to know constancy is enlightenment* (*zhī cháng yuē míng*).
Constancy refers to the **Dao/Way’s** true nature.
When a person knows their own nature and destiny,
returns to the **root** (*gēn*), and aligns with the **Dao/Way’s** origin,
unveiled by no external thing—
then they may truly be called enlightened.
People merely know Heaven, Earth, and all things,
yet fail to know their own source of life—
this is profound ignorance.
To conquer others is to have **strength** (*lì*).

Wang Yuán Zé said: *"Strength can conquer others,
yet it cannot conquer oneself."*

The saying goes: *"Yì excelled in archery, and Gōu in steering boats—
both conquered others through strength."*
The character *victory* (*shèng*) is derived from *strength* (*lì*), yet placed below it.
If strength is insufficient, victory cannot stand.
To conquer oneself is to be **strong** (*qiáng*)?

Wang Yuán Zé said: *"To conquer oneself is to restrain oneself and follow the Dao/Way,
to be able to focus one’s **qi** (*qì*)."*

Confucius said: *"The **root** (*gēn*) of a person desires this,
yet they cannot attain firmness—
this is the conqueror of themselves."*

Yang Zhu said: *"To conquer one’s own selfish desires is called *restraint* (*kè*)."*
When a person can restrain themselves,
overcome their own selfish desires and ambitions—
this is how they become truly **strong** (*qiáng*).
Not the strength of *forceful aggression* (*qiáng liáng*), but the strength of *upholding gentleness* (*shǒu róu*).

To know contentment is to be **wealthy** (*fù*).

Emperor Xuānzōng of the Tang said: *"To know when to stop seeking is to have no greed—
this is true wealth."*

Wang Yuán Zé said: *"Within the bounds of one’s nature,
all things are sufficient.
The humble may dwell in seclusion without loss,
the noble may act with great virtue without excess—
yet fools may cling to extreme nobility,
only to perish in their own corruption.
Thus, to know the wealth of the ten thousand things (*wàn zhōu*),
one may lightly regard the world and not be swayed.
This is true wealth."*

Mencius said: *"All things are already complete within me—
how could I not be wealthy?"*
This is the higher saying: *to know the limits of contentment is wealth.*
The next saying: *to take sufficiency from one’s nature alone is wealth.*

To act with **unyielding resolve** (*qiáng xíng*) is to have **will** (*zhì*).

The Duke of Shū said: *"The superior man hears the Dao/Way,
and acts with unyielding resolve—
thus, to act with resolve is to have will."*

Some will for high renown,
others for great gain—
this is not what is meant by *will*.
Only to act with resolve upon the Dao/Way
may one truly be called a man of will.

Not to lose one’s place is to **endure** (*jiǔ*).

Master He Shang said: *"When a person can regulate themselves,
not losing the **qi** they receive from Heaven—
then they may endure."*

Wang Yuán Zé said: *"When nature is not swayed by external things,
then they endure."
This is to exhaust one’s nature.

Master He Shang spoke of *nurturing the vital essence* (*yǎng jīng*).
Wang Yuán Zé spoke of *nurturing the spirit* (*yǎng shén*).
The two sayings combined in one are wondrous.

The *I Ching* says: *"The enduring is firm and long-lasting"* (*yì dá jiǔ yě*).
The virtuous person establishes a steadfast **Dao/Way** (*lì fāng*).
Not to change one’s **Dao/Way** (*fāng*) is to not lose one’s place—
thus they may endure.

To die yet not perish is **longevity** (*shòu*).

Wang Bí said: *"Even in death, if the **Dao/Way of life** (*shēng zhī dào*) is not lost,
then one attains complete longevity.
Though the body perishes, the **Dao/Way** remains—
how much more so when the body lives yet the **Dao/Way** is not fully realized?"*

Lù Xī Shēng said: *"When the body dies yet the **Dao/Way** does not perish,
then it may be called longevity."*

Wang Yuán Zé said: *"The death of a virtuous person is called *ghost* (*guǐ*),
for they have fulfilled their **Dao/Way** and returned to their true nature.
The death of a sage is called *god* (*shén*),
for they have never truly died nor truly lived.
The death of a fool is called *thing* (*wù*),
for though they live, they are already dead.
Those who exhaust the **Dao/Way** and nurture the spirit (*shén*),
though their form may change ten thousand times,
their true nature remains undiminished,
without end—
this may be called longevity.
This reaches the **Dao/Way’s** ultimate decree."*

Lù Diàn said: *"The *Lüzi*’s transformation,
Zhuāngzi’s non-death,
and the Buddhist teachings of non-extinction—
these share the same meaning.
Thus, the sage’s life
and death are spoken of together—
this is called *god* (*shén*).
The sage’s death,
and life are spoken of together—
this is called *longevity* (*shòu*).
This is because their life and death
have never truly differed.
For the sage, life and death share the same form,
and all things are held within the same **treasure-house** (*fǔ*).
Thus, the body is like the discarded husk of a cicada,
or the shed skin of a serpent—
mere temporary dwellings.
Though the cicada’s husk is dead,
its true nature has never perished.
Though the serpent’s shed skin is rotted,
its true nature has never been lost—
why so?
Because the true essence, though it dies, is not extinguished.

It is said: *"The perfect person is not burned by fire,
nor drowned by water.
Tigers cannot seize them,
and rhinoceroses cannot gore them.
They ride the void yet do not fall,
and strike rocks yet are unobstructed—
yet they have never truly died.*
Then again it is said: *"To die yet not perish—what does this mean?
The sage, in accordance with the times,
merely follows them.
When the times demand action,
the sage does not forcibly avoid.
When the times demand rest,
the sage does not forcibly act—
they simply observe Heaven’s will.
Thus, they have the ability yet do not exert it—
this is why they have life yet no death,
death yet no perishing."*

Yán Zūn said: *"To establish oneself in the world,
to promote benefit and remove harm,
to interact with others and adapt to changes—
nothing surpasses the wisdom of knowing people.
To gather intelligence and cultivate enlightenment,
to found a state upon its people,
to grasp the intent of the Dao/Way,
and the mind of Heaven—
nothing surpasses self-knowledge.
To govern with policies and rites,
to establish laws and customs,
to implement transformations and decrees,
to rectify the seas within—
to serve as a minister to the lords of the states—
nothing is more noble than conquering others.
To uphold **Dao/Way** and **virtue** (*dào dé*),
to align with Heaven’s clarity (*shén míng*),
to receive from Heaven and Earth,
to harmonize yin and yang,
to move the household and guard the state,
to bring the people joy and ease,
to be reverent, respectful, and cautious,
to be kind, filial, and law-abiding—
nothing is more exalted than knowing contentment."*

The mind wandering through the luminous clarity of **Dao/Way** and **virtue** (*shén míng*),
serene and tranquil, honored and flourishing—
nothing surpasses attaining one’s aspirations.

Serving in office and fulfilling duties,
attending to superiors and overseeing inferiors,
completing others’ undertakings,
continuing their legacies,
extending benefits to the myriad people—
nothing is more urgent than enduring longevity.

What Heaven and Earth hold most precious,
what all living beings rely upon,
to dwell within without satiety,
to rejoice in without cessation,
with ten thousand blessings arising together,
and none contending for favor—
nothing is more beautiful than longevity.

When functions and uses are fully realized,
yet no claim is made as one’s own.

Su Shi said:
*"There are beings born without claiming them,
and thus they are named and taken as one’s own.
There are beings avoided without possessing them,
and thus they are rejected and do not take form.
To be born without claiming,
to achieve without possessing—
only **Dao/Way** does this."*

Nurturing the myriad things yet not ruling over them.
*(One variant reads: "clothing and covering like garments.")*

He Shangong said:
*"Though **Dao/Way** nurtures the myriad things,
it does not, like a sovereign, take anything in."*

Cai Zihuang said:
*"To ‘clothe and cover’ means to shelter and nourish.
Though it shelters and nourishes the myriad things,
it does not rule over them—
it seems ever so small.
To always lack desire,
one may be called ‘small.’"*

Lǚ Jifu said:
*"All things great cannot be called ‘small,’
and small things cannot be called ‘great’—
this is **Dao/Way**.
Because it can move left and right with ease.
Thus, the myriad things rely upon it to live,
yet it does not claim them;
its deeds accomplished, it does not dwell upon them;
it clothes and covers the myriad things yet does not rule over them.
Only because it does not dwell,
only because it does not rule,
does it always lack desire.
To always lack desire—
this is the utmost subtlety.
Thus, it may be called ‘small.’"*

Wang Yuanzhe said:
*"This ‘small’ is truly ‘great.’
For those who embody **Dao/Way**,
like thoughts not yet arising,
serene and unified within—
is this not ‘small’?
The *Classic of Changes* says:
‘Returning to the small, yet distinguishing among things.’
The myriad things return to it without its ruling—
thus it may be called ‘great.’"*

Wang Yuanzhe said:
*"If one has intent to rule,
it opposes the things themselves.
Only because it rules over the myriad things
without ever intending to,
is it thus all-pervasive, with none able to separate.
**Dao/Way** returns to the utmost subtlety—then it is small,
yet distinguishes among things;
it manifests in the utmost transformation—then it is great,
yet interacts with things.
Distinguishing among things,
it covers the myriad things without displaying its sovereign function,
and does not rule—
thus it always lacks desire and may be called ‘small.’
This is what is meant by:
‘Returning to the small, yet distinguishing among things.’
Interacting with things,
it encompasses the myriad things without revealing their return,
and is unknown as ruler—
thus it may be called ‘great.’
**Dao/Way** is not something that can be named as ‘small’ or ‘great.’
When it is said ‘may be called,’
it refers to **Dao/Way**’s effect upon things.
Thus, the Sage never claims to be ‘great,’
and so is able to achieve true greatness."*

Cheng Xuan said:
*"This clarifies embodying **Dao/Way**.
The Sage forgets self to preserve things,
retiring in stillness and humility,
never claiming to be ‘great.’
Only because it prioritizes things over self,
forgetting the greatness of deeds,
does it become the leader of all Sages,
solely holding the highest honor of the Three Realms,
and thus achieves true greatness."*

Du Guangting said:
*"The Sage loves the people and cares for all things,
extending kindness to great and small alike—
this may be called ‘small.’
Yet it lets things follow their nature and return to Heaven—
this may also be called ‘great.’
The **Dao/Way**’s methods and transformations,
spreading **virtue** to the people,
stirring the pure and harmonious winds,
covering them with tranquil governance,
forgetting deeds and not claiming them,
not exalting itself—
thus its grand achievements may be great,
and its Sage **virtue** may endure.
Because it does not claim to be ‘great,’
it is able to achieve this exalted greatness."*

Those who cultivate their character
float without attachment,
like clouds without intention,
water conforming to its vessel—
able to turn left or right,
adapting to square or round,
not fixed in constancy,
responding as things come,
broadening with each reflection,
without measuring its applications,
benefiting things though many,
not boasting of its comprehensive aid,
its kindness reaching even the lowly,
never acting for private gain,
all virtues converging without its ruling—
thus it displays the **Dao/Way**’s non-small, non-great **virtue**,
without self-assertion or self-praise,
and may align with the complete and true **Dao/Way**.

Though crude and seemingly small,
none under Heaven can subdue it.
The Sage embraces simplicity and always lacks desire—
thus it may be called ‘small,’
meaning it never claims to be ‘great.’
Yet none under Heaven can subdue it,
and it alone achieves its exalted greatness—
thus it is able to achieve true greatness.

This chapter speaks of **Dao/Way**’s boundless use,
the foundation of all that is born and formed,
distinguishing among things as ‘small,’
interacting with things as ‘great.’
Thus, the Sage follows **Dao/Way**’s simplicity as ‘small,’
and achieves supreme honor as ‘great.’

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Grasping the Great Symbol**

Grasp the Great Symbol, and all under Heaven will follow.

Lǚ Jifu said:
*"**Dao/Way** in the world is like rivers and valleys to the seas—
the myriad things return to it without knowing its rule.
This is formlessness.
What formless thing could preserve me and not have me follow?
Thus it is said:
‘Grasp the Great Symbol, and all under Heaven will follow.’
‘Grasp’ means ‘to hold fast.’
The Great Symbol is **Dao/Way**.
The Great Symbol is formless—
**Dao/Way** in its entirety.
The Sage holds fast to it,
to govern the world’s norms.
All under Heaven and the myriad people
turn their hearts and follow.
Emperor Shun came to Denghu,
and ten thousand families came to him.
King Tai resided at Qishan,
and those who followed were like those going to market.
To follow without harm,
to be serene, peaceful, and at ease."*

Lu Yu said:
*"To receive people with emptiness—
what harm could there be?"*
To cause no harm to things,
one is serene, peaceful, and at ease.

Lǚ Jifu said:
*"If one loses **Dao/Way** and all under Heaven follows,
they will depart—
and their following will inevitably cause harm.
If one holds **Dao/Way** and all under Heaven follows,
even if they forget **Dao/Way**’s methods,
they will never truly separate—
thus their following causes no harm."*

Che Huibi said:
*"If one follows with burdens of life and death,
with worries and sorrow—
this is harm.
If one follows the Great **Dao/Way** of effortless ease—
this is no harm.
To speak of ‘serene, peaceful, and at ease’—
it is because one is not swayed by life and death,
and this is called ‘ease.’"*

「All **dharma** are undivided—
this is called *peace*.
Effortless ease—
this is called *tranquility*.

Once one has gone forth upon the **Dao/Way**,
then the realm is secure and the people flourish,
rejoicing in the Great Peace—
what harm could there be?
This is the meaning of *peaceful, tranquil, and at ease*.

*Secure* means no fear of peril or ruin,
*peaceful* means no treacherous or deceitful troubles,
*tranquility* means harmony and governance.

*Music* and *bait*—
passing travelers pause.
Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang said:
*"Music gathers through sound,
bait gathers through flavor—
passing travelers take delight and stay a little,
but not long."*

Lǚ Jifu said:
*"If there is music to be enjoyed,
if there is bait to be savored,
then those who pause are merely passing travelers.
The **Dao/Way** when spoken of—
its flavor is faint, without taste.
To gaze upon it—
it is not clearly seen.
To listen to it—
it is not clearly heard.
To employ it—
it cannot be exhausted.

*御注*: *"What is tasted is tasted;
yet those who taste it never truly perceive its flavor—
thus its flavor is faint, without taste.
What is colored is manifest;
yet those who see it never truly perceive its color—
thus it is not clearly seen.
What is sounded is heard;
yet those who hear it never truly perceive its sound—
thus it is not clearly heard.
If this is so,
then it can be bitter, can be sweet,
can be dark, can be bright,
can be *gōng* [1], can be *shāng* [2]—
without knowing yet without not knowing,
without ability yet without inability.
Thus it cannot be exhausted when employed."*

This passage speaks of the Sage guarding the **Dao/Way** to govern the world,
all under Heaven turning toward it without worry.
The **Dao/Way** is faint without flavor,
not like bait to be savored.
When listened to, it has no sound,
not like music to be enjoyed.
When employed, it is inexhaustible—
how could it be like passing travelers pausing briefly?

*"The chapter on **‘clasping and dispersing’** is the thirty-sixth.
**‘Clasping and dispersing’**—
when one would **‘clasping’** [3], they must first **‘dispersing’** [4].
When one would **‘weakening’** [5], they must first **‘strengthening’** [6].
When one would **‘abolishing’** [7], they must first **‘exalting’** [8].
When one would **‘taking away’** [9], they must first **‘bestowing’** [10].
This is called *subtle clarity* [11].

*御注*: *"Yin and Yang mutually illuminate and cover each other,
the four seasons mutually replace, give birth, and destroy each other.
The principles of all things,
the transmission of human relationships—
their gathering and scattering,
their flourishing and decline,
their rising and falling,
their deficiency and excess—
these are often revealed in the most subtle moments,
yet cannot be seen in their forms.
Only by studying these subtle shifts can one discern them.

Yin reaches its peak in summer while Yang arises at noon,
Yang congeals in winter while Yin arises at midnight.
King Goujian of Yue wished to weaken Wu, so he urged them to attack Qi.
Zhi Bo of Zhongshan wished to ambush Comrade You, so he gave him a wide carriage.
This is how the Sage treads upon frost and knows the approach of solid ice—
the ebb and flow of excess and deficiency are not fixed in their appearance.
Thus the brave cannot weaken,
and the wise cannot take away.

Yán Zūn said:
*"The **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** [12] are the path,
the divine and the bright are the record.
The transformations of Heaven and Earth,
the regulations of Yin and Yang—
the real becomes the virtual,
the bright becomes the obscure,
the flourishing becomes the declining,
the firm becomes the slack,
the present becomes the absent,
the living becomes the dead.
This is the nature of things,
the principle of the natural world.
Thus the advantage of reversals,
the benefit of bending and extending—
the **Dao/Way** governs Heaven,
Heaven governs the sovereign,
the sovereign governs the ministers,
the ministers govern the people.
All beings that contain **qi**,
employ it to sustain their lives.
Tigers and leopards, when they wish to seize,
first conceal their claws.
Jackals and wolves, when they wish to eat,
do not show their teeth.
The Sage removes their intentions,
to comply with the **Dao/Way**.
The wise adapt to the world,
to comply with the people.
Faithful words are harsh to the ear,
yet they contain truth and falsehood.
When ministers rise to act,
they must strive to comply with their sovereign.
To know this and employ it,
then between Heaven and Earth,
within the six directions [13],
all is blessed.
To not know this and employ it,
then within the household gates,
among kin,
all are thieves.
Thus sons and brothers,
at times become jackals and wolves;
enemies and grudges,
at times become fathers and elder brothers.
Yet within *this* there is *negation*,
and within *negation* there is *this*—
one negation, one *this*—
sometimes they perish, sometimes they endure.
Thus, even among the close, those not truly faithful cannot be trusted,
and even among the near, those not truly good cannot be loved.
This is the lament of the worthy,
the concern of the Sage and the wise."*

Lù Diàn said:
*"This is the ultimate **‘adaptation’** [14] of Heaven and Earth,
not merely the domain of the Sage.
For **‘adaptation’** is hidden in the profound and distant,
yet enacted through compliant and yielding means.
The depths are where the profound and distant reside.
The *Yì* says: **‘Compliance governs adaptation’** [15].
It also says: **‘Compliance’s virtue lies in concealment’** [16].
Compliance is the term for *gentle and weak*.
Concealment is the term for *subtle clarity*.
The *Lǎozǐ* says: **‘This is called *‘veiling clarity’*** [17].
It also says: **‘This is called *‘subtle clarity’*** [18].
*Veiling* means using clarity secretly,
*subtle* means concealing clarity deeply.
When clarity is veiled,
the divine and the bright align in meaning."*

Lù Xīshēng said:
*"The profound depths of the Sage’s teachings
are most wondrous in the interplay of **‘adaptation’** and reality.
Reality is rooted in compliance with the constant,
**‘adaptation’** is enacted by reversing the norm.
**‘Adaptation’** serves to fulfill reality,
reality serves to enact **‘adaptation’**.
Though they differ,
their ultimate aim is one.
The *Lǎozǐ* first guides through reality,
establishing the teaching of knowing the constant,
then employs **‘adaptation’** to aid things,
revealing the principle of reversal.
This is what the *Yì* means by:
**‘Curving to form all things without omission,
encompassing Heaven and Earth without excess.’** [19]

The *Hóng Liè* says:
*"King Huán of Qi loved flavors,
and Yí Yá cooked his own son as bait.
The Lord of Yu loved treasures,
and Duke Xiàn of Jìn used jade and horses to lure him.
King Hú of Chu loved music,
and Duke Mù of Qín enticed him with female performers.
These are all cases where people were governed by their own desires.

*Gentleness and weakness overcome firmness and strength.*
*御注*: The *Jīng* says:
**‘Nothing under Heaven is as gentle and weak as water,
yet in attacking firmness and strength,
nothing can surpass it.’** [20]
The *Zhuāngzǐ* (Outer Chapters) discusses how the *qíu* snake and the *fēngmù* bird [21] take pity on each other:
**‘If they point at me, they will overpower me;
if they blow upon me, they will overpower me—
yet when it comes to breaking great trees
and toppling great halls,
only I can do it.’** [22]"

「Zhōng Huì said: To subdue the rigid and strong, one must appear soft and yielding—first expanding, then contracting—then victory and defeat become apparent. The Tang Emperor Xuānzōng said: Compliance and submission enable the exercise of authority; when authority is wielded, one can govern all things. Thus, it is known that the soft and yielding must prevail over the rigid and strong.

Taking examples from oneself: Teeth, though firm, wear out first, while the tongue, though soft, endures. Taking examples from nature: Mountains, though high, lose their strength, while marshes, though low, grow fertile. Fish cannot be removed from the depths, nor can a state’s most potent tools be revealed to others.

*御注*: The depths are where fish conceal their bodies. Potent tools are what a state uses to subdue others. A fish as large as a boat, if stranded and loses its water, even ants can torment it—thus it cannot be removed from the depths. When a ruler is seen granting rewards, ministers exploit his authority. When a ruler is seen imposing punishments, ministers exploit his power. Rewards and punishments are instruments of governance and must not be displayed—how much more so the principles of governance itself?

The Sage wields potent tools yet does not reveal them—not because he relies on brute force, but because he possesses a subtle **Dao/Way**. He can exhaust the land’s resources without earning a reputation for cunning, dominate all things without displaying valor, and conquer without being defeated, attaining the **Way** of perpetual victory.

Yielding opens, concealing closes—endless transformations, guiding ministers and ruling the world without being fathomed. Thus, he governs others without being governed himself, for his power originates from above and rests with the sovereign, and the world is thereby governed.

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: Just as a fish cannot be separated from the depths, so too must a person not abandon softness and yielding—otherwise, they are doomed to death.

The ultimate softness traverses the ultimate rigidity; without entering any gap, it is the sharpest of tools. Wielding such tools to govern the world, a state’s strategies lie in the intangible—how can one reveal their origins?

Thus it is said: *A state’s most potent tools must not be revealed to others.*

Wáng Yuànzé said: Fish submit to softness and yielding, hiding in the depths to preserve themselves. The Sage retreats into seclusion, yet wields supreme authority alone, guiding all things beyond comprehension. Thus, he turns the heavens and earth effortlessly, yet none perceive his strength; he commands all under heaven, yet none attribute it to force. Would he expose his divine essence and let the masses debate it?

I have pondered this: What distinguishes the Sage from others is his foresight (*knowing the few*). If one meets things with rigidity and strength, those things’ rigidity and strength become insurmountable. All under heaven rely on rigidity and strength to conquer. I alone dwell in softness and non-contention, yet when I act, who can resist?

Observe the **Dao/Way** of Heaven: Autumn and winter give way to spring and summer—another verification. The Sage hides in the depths, yet presents softness and yielding as his exterior, guiding all things within their natural unfolding, while his essence remains unknown to all. This is what is called *secret action, solitary transformation*.

The *Yì* (I Ching) says: *Compliance enables the exercise of authority.*
The *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *Fish are trapped by calculation*—their meaning aligns here.

This passage speaks of compliance enabling authority, of softness and yielding prevailing over rigidity and strength. First expanding, then contracting—softness and yielding prevailing over rigidity and strength is evident. A person cannot abandon softness and yielding, just as a fish cannot be removed from the depths. The Sage wields potent tools yet does not reveal them—not because he relies on rigidity and strength, but because he embodies softness and yielding. Thus, he attains the **Way** of perpetual victory.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao/Way Constantly Does Not-Act, Yet Does Not Fail to Act**

Shū Wáng said: Earlier, it was said that the **Dao/Way** constantly has no name—speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s essence. This chapter speaks of the **Dao/Way** constantly not-acting—speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s transformations.

Líng Qì said: The **Dao/Way** as a formless form stands independent and unchanging, yet its form constantly resides in the utmost emptiness. The **Dao/Way** as a non-use that uses moves in cycles without beginning, yet its use encompasses all things. Because it is independent, it remains motionless and still, its essence complete and whole. Because it moves in cycles, it responds and communicates, its use encompassing all things thoroughly.

The **Dao/Way** exists as form yet is not form; it exists as use yet is not use. Though it does not-act, when it responds and communicates, it does not cease. Though it does not fail to act, it remains motionless and still alongside it. From its pairing and response, it is seen that it does not fail to act exhaustively, yet its ultimate return is to constant not-acting.

Because the **Dao/Way** constantly does not-act, it can do all things. Not-acting is motionless and still—the true essence of the **Dao/Way**, the so-called formless form. Not failing to act responds and communicates—the true use of the **Dao/Way**, the so-called non-use that uses. Thus it is said: *The **Dao/Way** constantly does not-act, yet does not fail to act.*

If lords and kings could uphold this,

Wáng Yuànzé said: A ruler embodying the **Dao/Way** to govern follows the times and aligns with principle without deliberate action, so though he does not-act, the world’s affairs are not neglected. Though the world’s affairs are not neglected, I have truly never acted. What does Heaven say?

The four seasons proceed, all things flourish—lords and kings’ **Dao/Way** exhausts Heaven’s purpose. All things will transform of their own accord.

*御注*: When lords and kings uphold the **Dao/Way**, they govern the world from a realm of not-acting, and their actions emerge from not-acting, lending transformation to all things. All things transform as if by their own nature, unaware of the one who guides them—thus, it is said they transform of their own accord.

Shū Wáng said: Speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s essence, it is said: *All things will submit to it as guests.* Speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s transformations, it is said: *All things will transform of their own accord.* When lords and kings uphold the **Dao/Way**, they do not-act. All things transform of their own accord through the **Dao/Way**, hence it does not fail to act.

Zhuangzi said: *Without acting, all things transform.* When transformation is about to manifest, Shū Wáng said: *To shape transformation is called change.* Speaking of transformation about to manifest, manifesting is merely movement.

Wáng Yuānzé said: When transformation progresses daily, it is like an infant’s growth—sure to reach a point where wisdom and deliberation arise, and the harmony of Heaven gradually wanes. Observing the end of the Three Dynasties, where customs and morals became refined and exhausted, one can understand this.

I shall govern with the nameless simplicity of the Uncarved Block.

Zhuān Wēi said: The **virtue/power** of the Sage’s transformation always rescues people. If there are those who do not submit to his transformation, yet cultivate sincerity in themselves and extend this cultivation universally to the world, then if lords and kings know and uphold it, will not the world’s cultivation be universal?

He who does not hoard the **Dao/Way** yet seeks to share its benevolence with the world—this is the **Dao/Way** of the lords and kings. To seek to share it with the world, one must first uphold it as lords and kings. Yet scholars, seeing only his words, speak of abandoning benevolence and righteousness, saying: *"Laozi undermines and belittles my benevolence and righteousness; I will not accept this."* Alas, they do not see the intent behind the abandonment, so it is fitting they reject it.

Lù Xīshēng said: The first chapter establishes the **Dao/Way** as its substance, common names as its function, and culminates in the *Yet More Mysterious*. This chapter takes *not-acting* as its substance, *without-not-acting* as its function, and unifies them under *comprehensive forgetting*. Beginning and end are interconnected, exhausting its substance and function.

Humans are born in stillness—this is the nature of Heaven. When stirred by things, they move—this is the nature of desire. Even the nameless simplicity of the Uncarved Block, if it does not desire, then nature remains still and corrects itself first. Thus, the world does not await correction but corrects itself naturally.

Lǐ Tián said: The Great **Dao/Way** takes emptiness and stillness as its true constancy, and responsive application as its subtlety. If lords and kings uphold its true constancy—remaining motionless in tranquility—and model its subtle applications, responding and thus harmonizing, then all things will transform in purity and the world will be rectified.

This chapter begins by speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s constancy in *not-acting* yet *without-not-acting*, and concludes with the *nameless simplicity of the Uncarved Block* without desire. If one harbors the desire for simplicity, it is not true *not-acting*. The *nameless simplicity of the Uncarved Block* in *comprehensive forgetting*—this is the **Dao/Way**’s constancy in *not-acting*. The world will naturally rectify itself—this is *without-not-acting*.

*The Compendium of Good Selections from the Dao De Jing*, Volume Five concludes. *The Compendium of Good Selections from the Dao De Jing*, Volume Six begins.

The *Collected Writings of Master Li Lin of Rao Mountain, Song Dynasty*
*Imperial Commentary*:

The **Dao/Way** has no fixed form, yet virtue has completeness and deficiency.
When aligned with the **Dao/Way**, there is no virtue to name;
when distinguished from virtue, there is a name to discern.
Ren, yi, li, and zhi—
received according to measure, applied according to time—
this is virtue alone.
Those who embody the **Dao/Way** differ from this,
and thus are placed in the lower scriptures.

Master Wang Yuanze said: *Virtue* is *obtaining*.
Things arise from the **Dao/Way**, each obtaining from it,
and thus it is called *nature*.
To obtain one’s nature without losing it—
this is the completeness of virtue.
Virtue has never differed from the **Dao/Way** yet possessed its own virtue,
but it has reached the point of self-indulgence and lost the **Dao/Way**.

As for the *True Person*, they do not cling to the reality of nature, life, virtue, and the **Dao/Way**,
but merge them into one.
Though the four names respond to the world with varied titles,
I know neither their difference nor their unity—
this is the profound aspect of virtue.

Still, virtue is *obtaining*—
how could one avoid losing it?
Only by taking *non-obtaining* as virtue,
and thus virtue becomes non-virtue—
this may be called the utmost.

This is the embodiment of the **Dao/Way**,
not one who possesses virtue.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Supreme Virtue Does Not Cling to Virtue**

The supreme virtue does not cling to virtue,
and thus has virtue.
*Imperial Commentary*:
Things obtain life and are called virtue.
All obtain in harmony, silently uniting with the **Dao/Way**,
passing without regret, achieving without self-possession—
this is called *not clinging to virtue*.

Confucius did not dwell on his sainthood,
but acted as a sage when the time demanded—
thus he truly had virtue.

Master Wang Bi said:
The person of supreme virtue uses only the **Dao/Way**.
Not clinging to virtue, without attachment or action,
thus they truly have virtue.

Master Gu Shenzi said:
The supreme virtue does not cling to virtue—
it aligns with the **Dao/Way**.
Virtue is *obtaining*.
To obtain the **Dao/Way** is to say this.
The person of supreme virtue aligns with the **Dao/Way** without a *heart of obtaining*,
thus their virtue is pure and tranquil.

The *Classic* says:
Though named as obtaining the **Dao/Way**,
in reality, there is nothing obtained.
The utmost ritual does not enter the self,
the utmost righteousness does not objectify,
the utmost wisdom does not scheme,
the utmost benevolence has no partiality—
this is called *not entering, not objectifying, not scheming, without partiality*—
this is *not clinging to virtue*.
Not clinging to virtue—
this is the utmost.
Thus it is called the supreme virtue.

The *Classic* says:
The supreme virtue is like a valley.

The lower virtue does not lose virtue,
and thus has no virtue.
*Imperial Commentary*:
Recognizing and holding onto it,
self-indulgent and losing the **Dao/Way**—
what virtue is there?

Master Cheng Xuanying said:
Not yet reaching the utmost,
thus called the lower.
Clinging to virtue without forgetting,
thus called *not losing*.

Master Su Shi said:
The sage follows their heart’s desire without overstepping the measure.
Not intentionally seeking virtue,
yet virtue is naturally complete.
Those of lesser understanding value virtue highly,
striving to avoid losing it—
merely preserving themselves,
what virtue is there?

Master Gu Shenzi said:
The lower virtue does not lose virtue—
virtue is obtained.
The lower virtue scatters the **Dao/Way** as virtue.
Thus, limping is called benevolence,
stumbling is called righteousness,
fastidiousness is called ritual,
and contrivance is called wisdom.
Though named as not losing,
virtue is far from the **Dao/Way**,
thus it has no virtue.

The supreme virtue acts without doing,
yet does not act.
*Imperial Commentary*:
Obtaining without thought,
achieving without effort,
arriving without action—
this is the supreme virtue.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:
To know *non-acting* and thus *not act*—
this is not the utmost.
To *not act* without knowing *non-acting*—
this is the utmost.

Master Wang Yuanze said:
The supreme virtue is *non-acting*,
yet also does not *do* anything—
virtue is naturally complete.

Master Cao Daochong said:
The highest virtue is originally *non-acting*,
not deliberately cultivating the thought of *non-acting*.

Master Lü Jipu said:
The supreme virtue is *non-acting*,
not intentionally so,
but naturally obtaining it,
and truly doing nothing.

Master Gu Xuan said:
Speaking of the supreme virtue’s transformation,
handling *non-acting* affairs,
practicing speechless teaching—
its traces are not evident.
Thus it is said:
*Non-acting* has no traces,
the heart has no desires—
thus it is said *without doing*.
Thus the supreme virtue’s *non-acting*
is not conforming to the beauty of *non-acting*,
but contains and nurtures pure simplicity,
naturally *non-acting*—
thus it is said *without doing*—
this is the heart and traces both *non-acting*.

The lower virtue acts,
and thus does something.

Master Lü Jipu said:
The lower virtue does not know this and acts,
thus cannot avoid *doing*.

Virtue, without *doing*, is sufficient.
Yet if there is benevolence in it,
then it is *doing*.

The person of lower virtue
does not obtain without thought,
does not arrive without action—
thus they neither reach *non-acting*
nor are compelled to *do*.

The supreme benevolence acts,
yet does not *do*.
*Imperial Commentary*:
Emperor Yao and Shun’s nature covered the world,
yet they did not do so for personal gain—
thus they did not *do*.

Master He Shanggong said:
Comprehensive aid without bias,
their benevolence is supreme—
thus it is called *upper canopy*.
*Doing* refers to the seven graces.
Accomplishing without claiming,
completing without controlling—
no attachment to action.

King Shuzong of Shu said:
The seven graces are
having those to love and those to cherish.
Only because they have those to love and cherish
can they not *do* without action.
The lower ones are known accordingly.

Master Wang Yuanze said:
Transformation is the longest of goodness,
another name for virtue.
Since it is distinguished from virtue,
this is *doing*.
Yet the sage’s transformation
fulfills nature and is sufficient,
requiring no artificial effort—
thus there is no *doing*.

The supreme righteousness acts,
and thus does something.
*Imperial Commentary*:
Arranging enemies and measuring appropriateness—
this is righteousness.
To establish the self,
to regulate affairs—
how could one *not do*?

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:
Righteousness is to judge what is wrong—
to say *judging what is wrong* is righteousness,
thus it is said *acts*.
With something to judge what is wrong and cut through,
ordering what is appropriate—
thus it is said *and thus does something*.
This is both heart and traces *doing*.

The *Miscellaneous Sayings* say:
The supreme virtue *does not act* yet *does not do*—
this is the Yellow Emperor.

The supreme virtue of *Ren* acts yet does nothing—
this is Yao and Shun.
The supreme righteousness acts and thus does something—
this is Tang and Wu.

Supreme righteousness, inferior virtue.

Someone said: Tang and Wu were great sages—
to call their virtue inferior, is that acceptable?
It was said: What sages share is the heart.
The reason virtue has superior and inferior is time.
Great sages in different times act accordingly.

When supreme ritual acts and none respond,
they roll up their sleeves and press forward.

Yan Junping said:
Empty and effortless, opening the Dao for all things—
this is the *Dao*-person.
Serene and responsive, doing nothing yet nothing is left undone—
this is the *virtue*-person.
Loving all things broadly and giving without end—
this is the *Ren*-person.
Ordering names and rectifying affairs according to what is fitting—
this is the *righteousness*-person.
Humility, withdrawal, yielding words, and reverent harmony—
this is the *ritual*-person.
These five are all acceptable—
this is the Dao.
But they are traces, not the ultimate.

The ultimate transcends all five—
how could it encompass them all?

Wu Jun said:
Ritual and wisdom are the great barriers against chaos.
Virtue and the Dao are the vast principles to soothe it.
Thus, the Dao is the root of ritual,
and ritual is the branch of the Dao.
Holding the root is easy and firm,
grasping the branch is difficult and perilous.
Therefore, the sovereign takes the Dao as heart,
virtue as substance,
*Ren* and righteousness as carriage and attire,
ritual and wisdom as crown and cap—
then, with hands resting, the world transforms itself.
But if one values ritual and wisdom while forgetting virtue and the Dao,
it is like having fine adornment without essence—
though diligent day and night, the world will decay.

The *Ren*-person gives without measure.
Righteousness chooses what to give fittingly,
without demanding return.
Ritual demands reciprocity.
To give without receiving in return is not ritual;
to receive without giving in return is also not ritual.
The principle of giving and receiving—
when ritual is practiced upon another and they do not respond,
one rolls up their sleeves and, angry, presses forward in pursuit.
Rolling up one’s sleeves means baring the arm by pushing aside sleeves.
In the Spring and Autumn era,
a single unavenged word, a single improper bow,
could lead two states to violent conflict—
yet they would still roll up their sleeves and press forward,
focusing on the lesser offense.
Thus, one loses the Dao and then virtue,
loses virtue and then *Ren*,
loses *Ren* and then righteousness,
loses righteousness and then ritual.
Ritual is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
yet the first cause of chaos.

*Imperial Commentary*:
The Dao cannot be attained,
so one loses the Dao and then virtue.
Virtue cannot be fully realized,
so one loses virtue and then *Ren*.
*Ren* can be practiced,
and when practiced, approaches righteousness—
so one loses *Ren* and then righteousness.
Righteousness can be diminished,
and when diminished, is adorned with ritual—
so one loses righteousness and then ritual.
When it comes to ritual, one drifts further from the Dao,
and the losses multiply.

All things cannot flourish simultaneously—
this is yin and yang.
They take from each other—
this is power and virtue.
Substance is thick where appearance is thin—
this is the ritual of father and son.
Thus observed, the more elaborate the ritual,
the more surely substance decays.
When substance decays, deceit follows,
and strife and chaos arise.
Therefore it is said:
Ritual is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
yet the first cause of chaos.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:
To lose the Dao is to lose supreme virtue.
Supreme virtue aligns with the Dao, hence "losing the Dao."
The seven stages of virtue and righteousness
are names for the times—simple or perilous.
Thus, when the Dao declines, virtue appears;
when virtue is lost, *Ren* remains;
when *Ren* vanishes, righteousness arises;
when righteousness is destroyed, ritual intervenes—
these are all adaptations to the times.
To discuss ritual in an age of purity is madness or heresy;
to forget ritual in a corrupt age is folly or deceit.
If one can dissolve and transform,
they should retreat from ritual and practice righteousness,
retreat from righteousness and practice *Ren*,
retreat from *Ren* and practice virtue,
forget virtue and merge with the Dao.
When people return to purity,
supreme virtue’s non-action prevails.

Zuan Wei said:
To neglect virtue, *Ren*, righteousness, and wisdom,
and rely solely on ritual teaching—
is this not the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
the first cause of chaos?
But if one honors virtue, *Ren*, righteousness, and wisdom
while also employing ritual and wisdom,
this is ritual elevated.
Then where would disorder arise?

Loyalty means no deceit;
trust means no falsehood.
Zhuangzi said:
In the age of supreme virtue,
substance exists without knowing it as loyalty,
appropriateness exists without knowing it as trust—
though loyalty and trust exist, they are unknown.
When ritual is applied,
jade and silk are exchanged in swift succession,
giving and receiving follow in turn,
bowing and kneeling, clasping hands—
all are mere outward decorum.
The heart may not truly align.
Yet substance is pure and returns to natural joy,
trust is genuine and conforms to ritual propriety.
When ritual and music spread everywhere,
the world descends into chaos.
The *Taishang* speaks of ritual as a deficient text—
dwell in its depth, not its shallowness.
Reside in its substance, not its ornament.
Thus, discard the latter and take the former.

Lu Jifu said:
Aspire to *Ren* and righteousness,
abandon ritual and wisdom,
and seek the fullness of virtue and the Dao—
this is discarding the superficial for the substantial.
Virtue and the Dao are thick and real;
ritual and wisdom are superficial and thin.
Thus, the true man discards the superficial ritual and wisdom,
taking instead the substantial virtue and Dao—
this is how the true man fulfills the Dao and preserves virtue.
This chapter speaks of the root of the Dao,
while *Ren*, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom are its losses.
Supreme virtue aligns with the Dao.
Thus, one does not retreat to virtue
but instead transforms righteousness and ritual,
and seeks the substantial virtue and Dao—
only a true man can attain this.

Formerly, in *Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Ancient Who Attained Oneness*—

The *Er Lu Tian* says:
To enter the One Dao is to gain it,
to exit the One Dao is to lose it.
The One is the boundary between existence and nonexistence.

*Liezi* says:
The One is the beginning of form’s transformation.

"Formerly" (*xī*) means speaking of antiquity as if it were recent.
"Formerly" refers to the time after Heaven and Earth.

The *Classic* says:
The Dao gives birth to the One; in things, it becomes *jing* (精).

Those who attained the One in antiquity—Heaven, Earth, the divine, and all things—
though they differ in high and low, dark and bright,
the One was never unequal.
Thus, it is said: *Its attainment is the One.*

The One is the root.
Heaven attains the One and becomes clear.
*Gu Huān* says: Heaven is pure *yang* qi.
Attaining the One, it is thus light and clear above.

Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil.
*Gu Huān* says: Earth is pure *yin* substance.
Attaining the One, it is thus still and settled below.

The divine attains the One and becomes numinous.
*He Shang Gong* says: When the divine attains the One, it can transform without form.
*Wang Yuanze* says: "Divine" refers to the spirit of ghosts and gods.
*Numinous* is the dispersion of the divine.

Valleys attain the One and become full.
*Guo Xiang* says: Valleys are the hollows of rivers.
Valleys and rivers, attaining the One, thus flow with springs and streams,
filling ravines and gullies.
*Wang Yuanze* says: The One, as One, pervades without limit,
so valleys, though empty, can respond—
the One abides within them.
*Lu Tian* says: The empty is the body of valleys; the full is their function.

All things attain the One and thus come to life.
*Zhang Junxiang* says: Sentient and insentient alike—
all things share the One Dao and thus take form.

Lords attain the One and become the rectification of the world.
*Its attainment is the One.*

*Commentary* says: *Zhuangzi* says: "To harmonize with the One is to complete all things."
Attaining the One means no duality;
embracing the One means no separation;
guarding the One means no deviation;
knowing the One means knowing all;
not knowing the One means knowing nothing.

Those who attained the One in antiquity!
They embodied the utmost *jing* of the world—
no thing could pair with them.
Thus, they stood firm above, pure and unmixed;
they settled below, still and unchanging.
The most hidden and formless—this is the divine.
Attaining the One, it does not grow dim.
The most empty and responsive—this is the valley.
Attaining the One, it does not run dry.
All things transform *jing* into form, thus attaining the One to live.
Lords govern the many through singularity, thus attaining the One to rectify the world.

From Heaven and Earth down to lords,
though high and low differ in rank,
dark and bright in dispersion,
Heaven’s clarity, Earth’s tranquility,
and the lord’s rectification of the world—
none seek this externally.
The One alone governs it.

Thus it is said: *Its attainment is the One.*
*Wang Yuanze* says: The One is undivided—
present in all things, yet its essence remains singular.
No other can achieve the One as the One itself can.

The meaning of the One—
the utmost *jing* of the world.
Only because it is *jing* can it become divine;
once divine, it is complete.
Yet the divine’s virtue ever abides in the One.

Lords govern the many through singularity,
thus becoming the rectification of the world.

The *Classic of Change* says:
"The movement of the world is rectified by the One and stops."

Heaven without clarity would fear splitting;
Earth without tranquility would fear erupting;
The divine without numinosity would fear ceasing;
Valleys without fullness would fear exhaustion;
All things without the One would fear annihilation;
Lords without singularity would fear toppling.

*Commentary* says:
Heaven’s duty is to cover; Earth’s is to bear.
If split, it cannot cover; if erupted, it cannot bear.
*Erupted* means to overflow.
The divine depends on humans to act—
if it ceases, it has nothing to show.
Valleys receive but do not store—
if exhausted, none would respond.
When gathered, *jing* qi becomes things—
this is attaining the One to live.
When scattered, wandering spirits become transformations—
this is losing the One to perish.
Perishing is the cessation of life.
Only rectitude can govern all transformations
and stand alone.

Above all things, there is none to rectify them,
yet lords, though noble and high, cannot preserve themselves—
how could they avoid toppling?
*Toppling* means the fall of the exalted.

*Wang Yuanze* says:
The One, as One, is everywhere—
to speak of its principle exhausts language.

Even in human form:
When a person is born, *jing* is the root;
the divine gathers from *jing*, and the body takes shape.
When *jing* is lost, the form dies and the divine departs.
Whether virtue or form, the principle is the same.

Thus, nobility depends on humility as its root,
and height depends on lowliness as its foundation.

*Commentary* says:
The humble is what the noble relies upon for stability;
the low is what the high arises from.

Common people see only the end,
but the sage probes the root.
Common people see only completion,
but the sage examines the subtle.

Thus, they ever attain the One.

*Sun Deng* says:
A nine-tiered tower begins with piled earth;
a hundred *rèn*-high height starts with a single basket.
This illustrates how nobility depends on lowliness as its foundation.

*Wang Yuanze* says:
Water, of the Five Phases, is numbered One,
yet it flows downward without contention—
this is the nature of *yin* and *yang*.

Those who know this Dao,
though seated in nobility and height,
do not forget their roots.
Thus, they are secure in their positions,
like preserving the divine while storing *jing*—
the divine ever remains.

Therefore, lords call themselves *gū* (孤), *guǎ* (寡), *bùgǔ* (不谷)—
this is their grounding in humility, is it not?

*Commentary* says:
*Gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ* are names of lowliness,
yet lords use them as titles—
they know their roots.
This is how lords, though noble and high, do not topple.

*Gu Huān* says:
*Gū* is the name for the fatherless.
*Guǎ* is the name for the bereaved.

「Not谷 (*bùgǔ*) is the term for the unvirtuous.
It refers to those who are not the central focus of all things and thus cannot unify the multitude’s praise.

All three of these names—*gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ*—
are what people hold in disdain,
yet lords and kings take them as their own titles—
is this not the very meaning of grounding in lowliness?

The term *bùgǔ* is one of careful inquiry,
stating that lords and kings label themselves *gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ*
to make clear their foundation in lowliness.

*Wang Yuanze* says:
One, though numerically the least,
is the root of all things.
Thus, knowing that the foundation lies in lowliness,
one understands that true nobility arises from embracing lowliness.

Therefore, he attains *shù* (数) and *yù* (舆),
yet finds no *yù* (舆).
*Commentary* says:
Those who exalt themselves to dominate others,
who claim nobility while degrading others,
yet fail to uphold their foundation in gentleness—
white without knowing to guard with black—
if they seek praise through such excess,
then hollow praise gathers violently,
while baseless slander follows swiftly,
and thus they attain no true praise.

*Tang Ming Huang* notes:
The character *shù* (数) is pronounced with an ascending tone,
while *yù* (誉) is pronounced as *yùzi* (舆子).

*Say* explains:
When *shù* (数) and *yù* (舆) are attained,
there is no *yù* (舆) left—
the axle is the foundation of the wheel.
When *shù* (数) and nobility are attained,
there is no true nobility—
lowliness is the root of nobility.
The axle is the foundation of the wheel,
so one must preserve the axle to stabilize the wheel.
Lowliness is the root of nobility,
so one must uphold lowliness to secure nobility.
Thus, this passage warns lords and kings to take lowliness as their foundation,
and so it speaks of attaining *shù* (数) and *yù* (舆).

*Wang Yuanze* says:
The character *shù* (数) is pronounced with an entering tone,
while *yù* (舆) is the character for *yù* (誉, praise).

*Say* explains:
Those who grasp the One
use lowliness as their foundation,
yet internally conceal the utmost nobility—
the world cannot attain them,
and they do not seek to be attained by the world.
If lowliness is truly their own,
and they govern with praise and reputation,
is this truly praise?

They do not wish to be polished like jade,
nor rugged like stone.
*Commentary* says:
Jade is noble, while stone is lowly,
yet both are fixed and unchanging.
The Sage adapts to the times and follows the natural order,
unhindered in all transformations.
Though the myriad changes are without constancy,
my heart remains ever One—
this is the true grasp of the One.
Thus, one cannot be attained in terms of nobility or lowliness.

*Mencius* said:
What I dislike about those who cling to the One
is that they cling to the One while abandoning the hundred.
They do not wish to be polished like jade,
nor rugged like stone—
this is not merely knowing the transformations;
even the Sage cannot surpass it.
This is what is called *shàngdé* (上德, highest virtue).

*Héshàng Gōng* (河上公) says:
*Lìnglìng* (琭琭) is a metaphor for scarcity,
*luòluò* (落落) is a metaphor for abundance.
Jade is scarce, hence it appears noble.
Stone is abundant, hence it appears lowly.
The saying does not wish to be like jade,
to be held in others’ esteem,
nor like stone,
to be held in others’ contempt.
One must dwell in the balance between them.

*Wang Yuanze* says:
Jade and stone are firm and unyielding,
fixed and unable to bend or change—
this is not the One.
But if one embraces the myriad transformations while remaining ever One,
then this is the true One.
Thus, jade is polished and noble,
yet cannot be lowly.
Stone is rugged and lowly,
yet cannot be noble.
*Lǎo Shì* (老氏, Laozi) having illuminated the One’s meaning,
feared that some might grasp the One as unchanging,
rigid like jade or stone,
and thus lose the true essence of the One.

Only those who embody the One
are both noble and lowly—
their virtue is like water,
adapting to square, round, crooked, or straight,
endlessly responding to all things,
yet never departing from the One.
Thus, they cannot be attained in terms of nobility or lowliness,
for the One transcends all nobility and lowliness.
This passage’s meaning is the most profound and difficult to express;
now I merely outline its core principles.

The Dao gives birth to the One,
and the One is the completeness of virtue.
When embodied in things,
it approaches the Dao.
This chapter takes the One as its central theme.

The One is the utmost refinement of the world.
Heaven, Earth, gods, and things—
noble or lowly, moving or still, growing or decaying—
all derive from the One to achieve their forms.
The *Tàishàng* (太上) fears that people will cling to the One
without understanding transformation,
and so concludes with *bùyù* (不欲, "do not wish"),
for those who are rigid like jade or stone
lose the true meaning of the One.

I humbly believe that the *Tàishàng*’s Dao
begins with refining *jīng* (精, essence) as its foundation,
then perfecting the *shén* (神, spirit) as its wondrous Way.
If the foundation is not established,
then the Dao has no means to arise,
so the One is taken as the foundation,
just as essence is refined to perfect the spirit.

It concludes with jade and stone,
fearing that people will cling to refining essence
without nurturing the spirit.
Even if their lifespan equals that of tortoise and crane,
they will never hope to attain the Dao of immortality.
Only when both essence and spirit are refined
and harmonized with the Dao
is this the true attainment.

**Volume Eight of the Collected Virtues of the Dao/De True Classic**

**Chapter Forty: The Dao’s Movement Lies in Reversal**

Reversal is the Dao’s movement.
Wang Yuanze said: *"To return to the origin is to be still; only stillness can give rise to movement—*
*just as autumn and winter give rise to spring and summer."*

Su Ziyou said: *"Reversal is restoration; to restore one’s nature is to be still.*
*Yet though it remains motionless and tranquil,*
*it responds and thus communicates with all things under Heaven—*
*this is how movement originates from stillness.*

*Gazing upward at Heaven,*
*the four seasons unfold,*
*withdrawing and storing in winter,*
*and flourishing and renewing in spring.*
*Looking downward at Earth,*
*the Five Phases have water,*
*which reverses its flow to complete the One,*
*and thus moves beneficially with the times.*
*The Dao of Heaven and Earth lies in reversal,*
*so they endure eternally.*
*Once a person receives their formed body,*
*they abandon its nature,*
*like a vessel among myriad things,*
*never reversing throughout their life—*
*alas, the sorrow of it.*

**Chapter Forty-One: The Weakness of the Dao**

The weak are the Dao’s instrument.
Shu Wang said: *"The Dao’s instrument lies in weakness,*
*for it is empty.*
*Consider Heaven—*
*even when it points to me, it also overcomes me,*
*and when it overcomes me, it also points to me.*
*Thus, the wind moving through the boundless void*
*may be called weak.*
*Yet nothing fails to be stirred by it,*
*no form fails to be swept by it—*
*so the wind’s power lies in its weakness.*
*Consider Earth—*
*when guided to the east, it flows east,*
*when guided to the west, it flows west.*
*Thus, water entrusted to the depths of the void*
*may be called weak.*
*Yet it dwells where all others abhor,*
*and assaults the firm and strong,*
*none can surpass it—*
*so water’s power lies in its weakness."*

He further said: *"Reversal is not the means by which movement arises,*
*yet there is what is called movement—*
*movement arises from reversal.*
*Weakness is not the means by which strength arises,*
*yet there is what is called strength—*
*for weakness can give rise to strength.*
*Though it speaks of reversal without mentioning stillness,*
*speaks of weakness without mentioning strength,*
*when it speaks of movement, one knows reversal is stillness,*
*and when it speaks of weakness, one knows its use is strength.*
*All things under Heaven are born from existence,*
*existence from non-existence—*
*and it is just so with this.*

*Weakness overcoming strength,*
*the Dao’s wondrous use—*
*as water, the weakest,*
*can assault the firm and strong.*
*All things under Heaven are born from existence,*
*existence from non-existence.*
*He Shang Gong said:*
*‘All things arise from Heaven and Earth,*
*Heaven and Earth have form and position,*
*thus they are said to be born from existence.’*
*‘The divine luminosity of Heaven and Earth all arise from the Dao,*
*the Dao has no form,*
*thus it is said to be born from non-existence.’*
*Lu Jipu said:*
*‘Only existence can give birth to all things under Heaven,*
*yet non-existence can also give birth to all things of existence—*
*thus the Dao’s movement lies in reversal,*
*and its use in weakness is known.’*
*So then, to seek reversal and weakness is no other thing,*
*but to perfect the One and reach the utmost of non-existence.*

*The meaning of this chapter:*
*To return to the origin and be still,*
*then movement will not be lost.*
*As Zhuangzi said:*
*‘Stillness gives rise to movement,*
*movement attains its purpose.’*
*The Dao’s use is never not beneficial,*
*so without contention, it can overcome strength—*
*as the Classic says:*
*‘The weak overcome the strong.’*
*So then, to seek reversal and weakness is no other thing,*
*but to perfect the One and reach the utmost of non-existence.*

**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**

The superior person hears the Dao
and diligently practices it.
*[Commentary:] A person of virtue who aspires to the Dao.*

The superior person hears the Dao,
with true virtue accumulating strength over time,
and utmost sincerity ceasing not.
Li Rong said: *"The more one believes in the Dao,*
*the more resolute one’s practice becomes.*
*Changing seasons do not alter their resolve,*
*melting gold and stone cannot move their conduct.*
*Firm from beginning to end,*
*steadfast without artifice—*
*this is the superior person’s movement in practice."*

The term *‘superior’* (上) refers to the highest rank.
The term *‘person’* (士) refers to one who takes the Dao as their calling.
The superior person, having attained enlightenment,
hears this wondrous Dao.
The more they believe in the Dao,
the more resolute their practice becomes.
Practice and reality correspond,
whether appearing or withdrawing,
whether acting or dwelling,
always relying on reality without separation.
True enlightenment grows with every thought,
the cultivation of the heart never falters—
thus it is called *‘movement in practice.’*

*A question arises:*
*The Dao cannot be heard,*
*yet if one hears it, it is false—*
*how then does the superior person hear it?*
*An answer is given:*
*‘To hear with the ears and practice with the heart,*
*this is true hearing.’*
*Confucius said:*
*‘To hear the Dao in the morning,*
*and die in the evening,*
*that is enough.’*

The middle person hears the Dao
as if it exists and yet does not exist.
Shu Wang said: *"The middle person knows the Dao as beautiful,*
*yet does not know what constitutes the Dao.*
*Knowing the Dao as beautiful,*
*they hear it like the great sound*
*that does not enter the vulgar ear."*

Li Rong said: *"Unspun silk does not resist change,*
*yet follows the shifting hues of black and yellow.*
*The middle person is undetermined,*
*their heart shifts with their likes and dislikes.*
*If they hear the true Dao for preserving life and stabilizing the realm,*
*they cherish the Dao and forget the world.*
*If they see wealth, beauty, or sensual pleasures,*
*they delight in their nature to gratify their desires—*
*then they cherish the world and forget the Dao.*
*The middle person can ascend or descend,*
*yet they harbor doubt in their heart.*
*Doubt arises, and their resolve is divided,*
*so though they hear the Dao,*
*they govern their body to prolong life,*
*and govern the realm to achieve great peace,*
*they rejoice and yet cling to it.*
*When they retreat and see wealth, beauty, or honor,*
*they may again forget it in their emotions and desires—*
*then they cannot move and practice it.*
*One moment they emerge,*
*one moment they withdraw—*
*like Zi Xia, who emerged to see the bustling splendor,*
*the dazzling beauty, and delighted in it,*
*yet hearing the Master’s Dao,*
*he took joy in that instead."*

The inferior person hears the Dao
and laughs loudly at it.
Wang Yuanze said: *"The Dao is vast, resembling what is not like,*
*unrecognized by shallow vision—*
*thus they laugh.*
*Indeed, as the following text says:*
*‘How could the vulgar ever perceive it?’*
Zhi Cong said: *"The inferior person hears of this wondrous Dao,*
*formless, nameless,*
*neither coming nor going,*
*neither born nor extinguished—*
*not believing in it,*
*they instead rebel against it,*
*so they clap their hands and laugh loudly,*
*calling it empty and false.*
*The inferior person is born with lowly nature,*
*indulging their emotions and many desires,*
*their wisdom insufficient to discern,*
*their understanding insufficient to know.*
*They admire beauty with their eyes,*
*desire to hear sounds with their ears,*
*crave to taste flavors with their mouths,*
*and their spirit longs to be fulfilled—*
*if they do not obtain it,*
*they fall into great anxiety and fear."*

The Dao/Way is without sound, color, taste, or flavor that can be obtained,
then its distance from what the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth crave is far indeed.

Hearing the Dao of tranquil stillness, desolate emptiness, and effortless non-action,
they laugh and reject it.
Not to laugh is not enough to be the Dao/Way.

Yang Fu said:
The lowly and ignorant are muddled,
valuing the superficial while despising substance.
The Dao/Way is profound and mysterious,
empty and distant.
If it is not scorned by shallow understanding,
it is not worthy of the utmost profundity.

Su Ziyou said:
The Dao/Way cannot be seen without form,
nor heard without sound.
If one does not first know the futility of all things,
then, unobstructed and insightful,
they may still be prone to disbelief.
Thus, the inferior person hears of the Dao/Way
and calls it absurd and extravagant, laughing at it.

The middle person hears of the Dao/Way,
and though they associate with its rise and fall,
they doubt it.

Only those who clearly perceive it
then act and embrace it without hesitation.

Confucius said:
*"Speak to them of the Dao/Way, and they do not grow weary—*
*that is my disciple Zilu."*

This is what is called the superior person.

To live with the common while opposing the Dao/Way—
*the "Classic" says:*
*"Few know me, and thus I am precious."*

**Commentary on the passage:**
*Jiàn* means "to establish."
*Here, establishing words of the Dao/Way—*
*this refers to the following text.*

Shu Wang said:
Confucius once remarked:
*"Lost in confusion, yet not awakening."*
I liken this to our Old Master [Laozi].
Indeed, the Old Master praised the ancient speakers of the Dao/Way,
for the ancients had these three sayings,
so he merely spoke of their confusion.

**Clarifying the Dao/Way as if in darkness,**
*the Imperial Commentary says:*
*"Like the sun’s light illuminating the lowlands—*
*that is clarity.*
*Abundant wisdom yet not displayed,*
*borrowing its radiance without flashing,*
*thus it appears as darkness."*

Wang Yuanzhe said:
Great clarity seems obscure.

Zhi Cong said:
Inner wisdom is clarity,
outer non-display is darkness.

**Advancing the Dao/Way seems like retreat,**
Li Rong said:
Hearing the Dao/Way and diligently practicing it—
this is advancing toward great achievement,
yet lacking is retreat.

Lü Jifu said:
To cultivate the Dao/Way is called "subtracting" (损).
Subtracting again and again,
until one reaches effortless non-action—
this is what is called advancing the Dao/Way as retreat.

**Leveling the Dao/Way as if uneven,**
Li Rong said:
To smooth and equal all things—
this is leveling the Dao/Way.
To blend with the world like dust and light—
this is being uneven.

Emperor Ming Huang of the Tang said:
*Leveling (夷)* means "smoothing."
*Uneven (颣)* refers to the irregular threads of silk.
Indeed, one who knows the mind’s clarity and stillness,
where desires and dust do not arise,
is naturally smooth and easy,
boundless with all things,
yet outwardly appears like silk with uneven threads.

Du Guangting said:
The enlightened person cultivates themselves—
internally, they are smooth and level,
externally, they blend with the world.
Enduring hardship while meeting joy,
adapting to the times—
like silk with uneven threads.

The Dao/Way is singularly unified,
yet things are infinitely diverse.
Those who embody the Dao/Way,
internally are smooth and level,
fixed and unchanging,
externally adapt to all things,
shifting with their transformations—
thus, they appear uneven.

**Superior virtue is like a valley,**
*the Imperial Commentary says:*
*"A valley is empty yet receptive,*
*receptive yet does not accumulate.*
*Empty yet responsive,*
*responsive yet inexhaustible."*

Lu Tian said:
The utmost emptiness supplies all demands,
the utmost void responds to all feelings—
thus, it is called superior virtue like a valley.

**Great whiteness seems like disgrace,**
Li Rong said:
Pure yet not tainted—
this is great whiteness.
Mingling with filth—
this is disgrace.

Lu Tian said:
Knowing whiteness yet guarding against blackness,
knowing honor yet guarding against disgrace—
thus, it is called great whiteness as disgrace.

The truly pure and white,
internally harbor clarity and stillness,
clearly manifest and refined,
washing away all stains—
this is great whiteness.
Hiding their light, blending with the world,
dwelling where the crowd reviles—
this is disgrace.

**Ample virtue seems insufficient,**
Sun Deng said:
If virtue is deep and broad,
then the distant and shallow are seen as trifling,
and minor details are overlooked—
like wisdom and knowledge being insufficient.
Thus, a skilled merchant hides their wealth as if they had none.
A person of great virtue,
though their appearance seems foolish—
this is ample virtue appearing insufficient.

Zhi Cong said:
Indeed, superior virtue accomplishes the ten directions,
adorns all things,
its transformation boundless—
this is called "ample."
Though it is said to have virtue,
yet it appears as if without virtue—
this is truly without virtue,
hence, it is called insufficient.

**Establishing virtue seems like theft,**
Emperor Ming Huang of the Tang said:
*Jiàn* means "to establish."
*Theft (偷)* means "to steal."
Speaking of establishing hidden virtue,
secretly cultivating and acting—
like a thief, always fearing discovery,
thus it is called seeming like theft.

Che Huibì said:
The Sage establishes all virtues,
saves all beings,
wondrously employing hidden and flowing functions,
unnoticed by others—
thus, it is called seeming like theft.

These two interpretations speak of theft as *stealing*.

Su Ziyou said:
To follow things’ natural course without imposing—
externally, it seems like laziness and theft,
yet truly, it is establishing.

Wang Yuanzhe said:
*Theft (偷)* means "hasty and careless."
Small-minded, seeking quick results,
striving to establish something—
how could this suffice as virtue?
Only those who follow the seasons and act according to principle,
appearing as if lazy and careless,
truly establish the great virtue.

Zhuangzi said:
*"Acting only when there is no alternative."*

These two interpretations speak of theft as *laziness and carelessness*.

**True substance seems to change,**
Wang Yuanzhe said:
Embodying nature and holding onto the spirit,
wandering among the world’s affairs—
endlessly adapting to the world,
yet their Dao/Way remains constant,
so none know its true substance.
That ancient recluse of the Han dynasty,
Yin Zhang, steadfastly held to his true nature,
yet differed from the world,
startling Zigong’s disciples,
while the Sage saw him as a false cultivator of chaos—
could this be called true substance?

Su Ziyou said:
Embodying nature and holding onto the spirit,
adapting to things’ transformations,
yet never losing their true essence—
externally, it seems to change.
*Substance (质)* refers to inherent nature,
*true (真)* to pure unity,
*change (渝)* to shifting colors.
Speaking of the Dao/Way’s practitioner,
true in nature and pure without falsity,
yet appearing to change,
like waves blending with all things.

**The boundless has no corners,**
*the Imperial Commentary says:*
*"The boundless is the Dao/Way without boundaries—*
*boundless yet not dividing,*
*thus it has no corners."*

Li Rong said:
The universe is vast and has form—
thus, it has boundaries.

The Dao/Way’s ultimate reaches formlessness—
thus, it has no corners.

Lǚ Jìfǔ said:
The boundless form encompasses no south, no north,
yet unfolds in four directions,
plunging into the unfathomable.
No east, no west—
it originates in the Mysterious Void,
returns to the Great Communion—
this is the boundless’s lack of corners.

Wáng Yuānzé said:
The boundless is the Dao/Way’s essence.
If it had four corners,
its form would be confined to what is seen—
its smallness would be long past.

**Great vessels take time to mature.**
*Imperial Commentary says:*
The great vessel is the vessel that is not a vessel.
Neither aiding birth nor assisting growth,
thus it matures late.

Táo Hóngjìng said:
Accumulating virtue, the Dao/Way is fulfilled—
this is called a great vessel.
Not achieved in a single day,
hence, it matures late.

Lù Dìan said:
In conduct, its pace is slow yet unceasing—
thus, it is said: *Great vessels take time to mature.*
The great vessel is the vessel of the Dharma-body.
The Dharma-body’s great vessel is realized through accumulated merit,
not in a single morning or evening—
thus, it matures late.

Zhuāngzi said:
Perfection lies in duration.

**Great sound is rare in voice.**
*Imperial Commentary says:*
Its motion is boundless, yet response follows—
thus, it is rare in voice.

Wáng Bì said:
To hear without hearing is called rare—
a sound that cannot be heard.
If there is voice, there is division;
if there is division, it is neither *gōng* nor *shāng*.
Division cannot harmonize all things,
so one with voice is not great sound.

Zhì Cóng said:
Rare in voice is like having no voice.
The Sage’s single teaching pervades the ten directions,
opening the dense and enlightening the vulgar,
though teaching fills the ten directions—
this is called constant stillness.
Teaching is no teaching,
speaking is no speaking—
by this meaning, it is called rare in voice.

*Commentary says:*
The Dao/Way responds to all sounds—
this is great sound.
To listen without hearing—
this is rare in voice.

**Great images are formless.**
Zhōng Huì said:
Without images, it does not respond—
this is called great image.
Since it lacks substance and form,
how could it have shape or description?
The great image is the image of no image.
Since the image has no image,
how could it have form or shape?

The Dao/Way is hidden, nameless.
Zhuǎn Wēi said:
The Dao/Way originally has no name,
yet it is forcibly named *Dao*.
Now the Dao/Way is hidden within it—
what name could there be?
This is truly what is called *erasing traces and concealing origins*.

Lǚ Jìfǔ said:
All these are the Dao/Way.
Yet calling it clear yet obscure,
level yet uneven,
advancing yet retreating—
to the point of sound being rare in voice,
images being formless,
names and reality constantly opposing—
since the Dao/Way is hidden in the nameless,
and it is named with names,
it is constantly as if opposed.

Only the Dao/Way
is both generous and fulfilled.

Gù Huān said:
Giving before receiving is called generous;
things obtaining the Dao/Way is called fulfilled.
When fulfilled, it returns to the Dao/Way—
the Dao/Way obtains it.

Zhì Cóng said:
Now, the few who are born are born by the Dao/Way.
Generous, you should awaken—
returning to the Dao/Way, why cling to life as life
and not return to the root?

Shū Wáng said:
The truly generous is what all things rely upon without depletion.
Yet it returns to its origin—
thus, it is fulfilled.

This chapter speaks of the Dao/Way’s profound subtlety,
its hidden depth and difficulty to perceive.
From the *Illuminated Dao* to the *Great Image*, all are the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way’s marvel cannot be sought by intellect,
cannot be pursued by form—
it can truly be called hidden.
The Dao/Way’s essence is hidden in the nameless,
yet its function is both generous and fulfilled.
The superior person awakens to this and diligently practices;
the inferior hears of it and thus laughs greatly—
truly, as the chapter says,
how could the common crowd recognize it?

**Chapter 42: The Dao/Way Generates One**
The Dao/Way generates One,
One generates Two,
One generates Three,
Three generates the ten thousand things.

Lù Dìan said:
The Dao/Way generates One—this is the Supreme Ultimate.
One generates Two—this is yin and yang.
Two generates Three—this is the *chōng* qi.
With yin and yang, and the *chōng* qi between them,
then the ten thousand things are born.
Thus, it is said: *Three generates the ten thousand things.*

Lǐ Róng said:
One generates Two—clear and turbid separate, yin and yang manifest.
Two generates Three—cycling the two qi, forming the Three Powers.
Three generates the ten thousand things—
the round heaven covers above,
the square earth bears below,
and the Sage rules between—
what thing does not generate?

Gǔshénzǐ said:
The Great Dao/Way is natural,
transforming to generate spirit,
spirit moves to form harmony,
harmony disperses to condense qi,
qi condenses to form shape—
thus, it is said:
*The Dao/Way generates One,
One generates Two,
Two generates Three,
Three generates the ten thousand things.*
One is the beginning of form’s transformation.
The light and clear become heaven,
the heavy and turbid become earth,
the harmonious *chōng* qi becomes humankind.
Thus, heaven and earth contain essence,
and the ten thousand things transform and generate.

The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang,
Héshànggōng said:
The ten thousand things without fail bear yin and turn toward yang,
retreating inward yet seeking the sun.
The *chōng* qi harmonizes them.

Lù Dìan said:
The Daoists call it *chōng* qi;
medical scholars call it stomach qi.
With yin and yang, then stomach qi arises within.
Bear means *back*;
embrace means *face*.
*Chōng* means *central*.
All that is dark and unfathomable is yin;
all that is bright and visible is yang.
All that lives must turn its back to the dark
and face the bright.
Yet the ten thousand things cannot generate alone with yang,
cannot form alone with yin—
they must have the central harmony of yin and yang,
then things generate.
As Zhuāngzi said:
Extreme yang is blazing,
extreme yin is solemn—
solemn arises from heaven,
blazing issues from earth.
The two intermingle to form harmony,
and thus things generate.

What people detest—
the terms *gū* (orphan), *guǎ* (widow), *bùgǔ* (barren)—
kings and dukes adopt as titles.

Zhuǎn Wēi said:
*Gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ* are terms of softness, weakness, and humility—
what the vulgar detest and avoid.
Yet it is the noble Sage and great person who thus refers to themselves,
and by this attains the nobility of kings and dukes.

This law is the harmony of *chōngqì* (penetrating qi), diminishing the overbearing strength of the will while seeking to augment virtue and Dao.

The terms *gū* (orphan), *guǎ* (widow), and *bùgǔ* (barren)—
these are the lesser evils.
Kings and dukes, occupying the highest stations,
adopt what people detest as their own titles,
dwelling in humility, conforming to softness and weakness,
to align with the harmony of yin and yang.

Thus it is said:
Things may be diminished to gain benefit,
or augmented to suffer loss.

Li Róng said:
To hold wealth and nobility yet call oneself *gū*, *guǎ*, or *bùgǔ*—this is diminution.
Renewing virtue with daily humility—this is augmentation.
To occupy high station without virtue is self-augmentation;
talent unmatched by rank invites ruin—this is diminution.

The *Commentary* states:
*"Gu"* is a continuation of the preceding argument.
When kings and dukes name themselves *gū*, *guǎ*, or *bùgǔ* in self-abnegation,
the people rejoice in honoring and serving them—this is augmentation through diminution.
Or, when augmentation leads to loss:
If kings and dukes, in their exalted station, grow arrogant,
the people scatter and withdraw—this is diminution through augmentation.

As the *Yijing* says:
*"Fullness invites loss; humility invites benefit."*
Thus it is spoken.

Shū Wáng said:
The Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and augments humility.
Only by augmenting humility can one truly diminish—
for what is diminished becomes the source of benefit.
Only by diminishing excess can what is augmented become the source of loss.
Thus, the titles kings and dukes adopt
are the means to attain benefit while dwelling in high station.

What people teach,
I also teach as my doctrine.

Hé Shànggōng said:
What the masses teach is to discard weakness for strength,
to discard softness for rigidity.
I teach the masses to discard strength for weakness,
to discard rigidity for softness.
What people teach others,
they should teach with my doctrine of softness and weakness.

The overbearing perish without proper death.
Hé Shànggōng said:
The overbearing are those who reject the Mysterious and Profound,
who defy virtue and Dao, who disregard teachings,
and rely on power and force.
To not die a proper death means to be cut off by Heaven,
slain by blades, executed by law—
not to die a natural death in full years.

Yán Xiān said:
Strong Qin perished through tyranny,
Great Han flourished through harmony.
The overbearing lose the Way,
the rigid lose the numinous.
Once the vital principle withdraws,
how can they endure?

The *Explanation of Characters* says:
The beams of a house rest on sturdy supports—
thus the name *liáng* (beam).
Of all things, none are stronger than beams.
The "overbearing" are like beams in strength.
The strong among men are but companions of early death.

Zǐlù loved valor yet died untimely.
Yì excelled in archery, yet drowned in a boat—
both perished without proper death.
Yet these were all failures of the doctrine of softness and weakness.
I shall take this as my teaching for fathers.

Li Róng said:
To disobey one’s parents and rulers,
to defy the teachings of the sages,
to hoard glory while clinging to victory,
to exalt oneself over others—
this is overbearing.
To violate laws, to meet untimely death in mid-life,
to not die a proper death—
this is the fate of the overbearing.

All things conform to the Dao;
the sage never fails to teach.
Human nature, straying from reason, is the origin of speech.
Through the splendor of benevolence and righteousness,
the reality of virtue and Dao is revealed.
From the nature of overbearing strength,
the method of softness and weakness is expounded.

This chapter speaks of how the Dao generates *yīqì* (unity-qi),
how *yīqì* generates yin and yang,
how yin and yang generate *chōngqì* (penetrating qi).
Things obtain *chōngqì* to achieve harmony.
The qi of penetrating harmony is the essence of softness and weakness.
Kings and dukes, conforming to softness and weakness,
adopt *gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ* as titles—
this is diminution yielding benefit.
The masses, favoring overbearing strength, do not die proper deaths—
this is augmentation yielding loss.
The great sage expounds this as his teaching for fathers.
Truly, it is so.

**Chapter 43: The Supreme Softness of the World**
The world’s supreme softness
gallops across the world’s supreme firmness.

**Li Rong said:**
The supreme softness among things with form—water.
The supreme softness without form—Dao.
Water, though supremely soft, can dissolve gold and pierce stone,
shatter the firm and the strong.
Dao, though supremely soft, can abandon all and forget self,
shatter this stubborn fixation.

If one reflects upon it like water,
embodies it like Dao,
one can penetrate the self and the other,
traverse hills and mountains—
subtle, mysterious, and boundless,
without obstruction or hindrance.
This is called galloping across the supreme firmness.

The supreme softness is water.
The supreme firmness is metal and stone.
Water can penetrate the firm and enter the hard,
passing through all without obstruction.
Water, being supremely soft, nearly attains Dao.
How much more so the formless!

The supreme softness of Dao
envelops heaven and earth,
penetrates all things—
this is how softness overcomes hardness.

"Galloping" means penetrating and flowing freely.

*The Classic* says:
Nothing is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing surpasses it in attacking the firm and strong.
It enters without gap—
*Riverbank Master* said: "Without gap" refers to Dao.
Dao has no form or substance,
thus it enters and exits without obstruction,
communing with the divine and benefiting all beings.

*Yan Zun* said:
Formed things cannot pierce sharpness,
but the formless divine dwells within—
entering without openings, exiting without traces,
in the blink of an eye, traversing thousands of miles.
"Without gap" is the divine.

The divine’s work—
its utility in entering and exiting—
leaves no trace,
piercing metal, penetrating stone,
entering without gap.
The divine resides in the heart,
the heart harbors the divine.
Empty the heart to preserve the divine,
preserve the divine to seek the ultimate.
Straightforward, it pushes forward;
curved, it yields.
In all directions—up, down, left, right—
it rests where it will,
endless in coming and going,
circulating through the boundless void,
ascending to the heavens, descending to the earth,
sixfold passage, fourfold opening—
nowhere it enters without finding its own way.

Thus I know the benefit of *wuwei*.

*Imperial Commentary*:
Softness overcoming hardness,
the void embracing the having—
the marvelous function of Dao lies here.
Abandoning affairs, the form does not labor;
forgetting life, the essence does not diminish—
this is how it is beneficial.

*Wang Bi* said:
Softness and weakness, emptiness and void—
nothing they cannot penetrate.
The supremely soft cannot be bent,
the void cannot be exhausted—
thus, by extension, one knows the benefit of *wuwei*’s Dao.

*Li Rong* said:
Dao is formless, yet things obtain life;
the sage acts without doing, yet people are transformed—
this is the benefit of *wuwei*.

Softness is the root of Dao,
the void is its function—
the supremely soft and void is Dao.
Dao acts without doing, yet all things transform—
thus one knows the benefit of *wuwei*’s Dao.

The teaching of the unsaid,
the benefit of *wuwei*—
few in the world attain it.

*Imperial Commentary*:
The teaching of the unsaid is set by the divine,
the benefit of *wuwei* does not deplete the true.
The sage embraces simplicity,
and the world submits as a guest.
*Wuwei* yet all things transform—
thus those who attain it are few.

*Gu Huan* said:
Following Dao without words, yet customs shift—
thus it is called the teaching of the unsaid.
Following Dao without doing, yet people and things transform—
thus it is called the benefit of *wuwei*.
This chapter speaks of Dao’s softness, weakness, and void,
acting through the unsaid to teach,
*wuwei* to transform the people.
Those who attain this Dao in the world—
are they not few?

**Chapter 44: Name and Body**

Name and body—
which is more intimate?
Body and wealth—
which is more abundant?

*Imperial Commentary*:
If both arms weigh heavier than the world,
then name and body—
which is more intimate?
Life is not merely as precious as the pearl of Huai—
then body and wealth—
which is more abundant?
The most desired name is within me—
it is not intimate.
The most abundant wealth is within me—
it is not abundant.
Only those who fail to discern intimacy and distance,
abundance and scarcity,
ruin life and harm nature,
sacrificing the body for it—
like Boyi starving to death for name beneath Chief Yang’s hill,
or Zhi the robber dying for gain at Dongling’s peak—
is this not delusion?

*Li Rong* said:
The body is the foundation for cultivating Dao—
thus it is intimate.
Fame is a hollow convention—
thus it is distant.
People cannot sacrifice the body for name;
they only sacrifice the body for name.

*Wang Bi* said:
To prize name and seek loftiness—
one’s body will be distant.
To covet wealth without satisfaction—
one’s body will be diminished.

*Lu Jifu* said:
The resolve of the virtuous is for name—
yet to ruin life and harm nature,
they do not know the body’s intimacy to name.
Thus it is said: Name and body—
which is more intimate?
The resolve of the greedy is for wealth—
yet to ruin life and harm nature,
they do not know the body’s abundance over wealth.
Thus it is said: Body and wealth—
which is more abundant?
Name is empty fame.
Wealth is material goods.
The body is the foundation for cultivating Dao—
how could it not be more intimate than name,
more abundant than wealth?

Fame brings danger to the body—
Meng Zhang declined the Chu chancellor,
preferring to be a tortoise dragging its tail.
The Celestial Master refused the official post,
wishing only to learn the Dao of Huangdi.
Thus it is known: the body is intimate, name is distant.

Gain and loss—
which causes greater harm?

*Zuan Wei* said:
This elucidates the two sentences above.
Empty fame and fleeting gain—
obtaining them is as light as a feather.
Life, nature, form, and spirit—
losing them is as heavy as Tai Mountain.
The enlightened weigh them—
which causes greater harm?

*Li Rong* said:
Name is external praise.
Wealth is worldly goods.
The body, when loyal and filial,
or when cultivating the ultimate Dao—
if weakened by loss, it does not return;
if pursued by desire, it loses its true nature.
To sacrifice the body for name,
to harm oneself for wealth—
the deluded are many.
The sage inquires carefully:
Between gaining name and wealth,
and losing the body—
which causes greater harm?

*Lu Jifu* said:
If one’s resolve is for name,
the world calls them a *junzi*.
If one’s resolve is for wealth,
the world calls them a *xiaoren*.
Though their resolves differ,
losing what they cherish is the same.
Then to gain name and wealth
while losing what is essential—
they do not know that loss is worse than gain.

Thus it is said:
Which is more harmful—gain or loss?

Therefore, the more one loves, the greater the expenditure.
The more one hoards, the greater the loss.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:
To love name excessively is to exhaust one’s spirit—is this not great expenditure?
To hoard wealth excessively is to burden oneself—is this not great loss?

Liu Jinxi said:
Insatiable greed is called excessive love.
Excessive desire harms the body, hence it is called great expenditure.

Lu Jifu said:
To love name is to desire wealth and noble status for oneself.
Because of this excessive love, one loses even the finest virtues—this is great expenditure.
To hoard wealth is to desire riches for oneself.
Because of this excessive accumulation, one loses even the greatest riches—this is great loss.

Knowing contentment brings no disgrace.
Knowing when to stop brings no peril.
Thus one may endure and live long.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:
Disgrace is loss and burden.
Peril is danger and ruin.
To shun fame is to know contentment.
To refrain from amassing wealth is to know when to stop.
Knowing contentment, one’s name matches reality without excess burden.
Knowing when to stop, one does not hoard wealth without the harm of greed.
Without disgrace or peril, one may endure and live long.

Li Rong said:
Not seeking name through external means is to avoid disgrace.
Not pursuing wealth against reason is to avoid peril.
To distance oneself from name and profit is to distance oneself from peril.
Thus, governing a state may endure, and cultivating oneself may last long.

Lu Jifu said:
Only those with virtue know the true nobility within themselves and need no external name.
Thus, knowing contentment brings no disgrace.
Only those with true wealth know the abundance within themselves and need no external riches.
Thus, knowing when to stop brings no peril.
Without disgrace or peril, one may endure long.

This chapter’s intent is that those who seek longevity must first abandon profit and forget fame.
If name and profit are not discarded, body and mind are enslaved—
not only does this obstruct the Dao,
but in time, it will harm the body.
Thus, ancient masters of the Dao
did not seek fame,
did not amass wealth.
Though they held high office or vast emoluments,
they discarded them like worn-out shoes,
viewed them as passing clouds.
Some took joy in coarse rice and water,
others dwelled in humble huts.
Ministers of state could not recognize them,
emperors could not command them as subjects.
They lived in forests and caves,
ate pine shoots and drank from streams.
Would they harm the true essence of life
for the fleeting illusions of fame and wealth?
This is the utmost warning for Daoist practice,
the essential duty of self-cultivation.
Thus, ancient examples are cited—
those who seek the Dao must cast off these shackles.

**Chapter Forty-Five: Great Fullness as if Deficient**

Great fullness as if deficient—
its use is unexhausted.

*Official Commentary:*
Within the realm, there are four great principles, and the Dao occupies one.
To embody the Dao fully is why it may be called "great."
Without completion or deficiency, this is called "great fullness."
Not having its fullness, it is as if deficient.
Understanding transformation and adaptation,
yet not clinging to fixed forms,
its use is unexhausted.
This is how Confucius gathered the great teachings and became the Sage of his time.

River Master Hu said:
This refers to a ruler of great virtue and fullness,
as if deficient—
erasing his name, concealing his reputation,
like a broken vessel lacking completeness.
If one’s mind is thus, there is no time of exhaustion.

*Zuanwei* said:
Deficient means broken.
Exhausted means ruin and defeat.
Great fullness refers to a person of complete virtue.
One whose virtue fills within
can embrace chaos and contain filth.
Though their form may be fragmented,
like a vessel with cracks and stains,
rarely is their use seen—
thus they preserve their completeness
and avoid the ruin of exhaustion.

Those who achieve success are deficient in it.
Those who achieve success but do not dwell on it
thus do not abandon it.
Those who achieve fame gather it,
but if they do not cling to empty reputation,
their fame does not fade.
The Perfect One sees the forms of completion and decay,
thus abandons success and fame,
and returns to the common way.
Their Dao is great and full,
yet ever as if deficient.

Emperor Yao achieved success yet saw himself as deficient—
thus he became the greatest of the Five Emperors.
Confucius gathered the great teachings yet did not dwell on his sainthood—
thus he became the teacher of all ages.
His use grows ever newer, never exhausted—
how could it be worn out?

**Great Fullness as if Empty**

Its use is inexhaustible.

*Official Commentary:*
Filling all without boundary,
surpassing all things—this is great fullness.
Empty to respond to all things,
simple yet effective—
thus its application is boundless,
its use inexhaustible.

A wise merchant hides his goods deep,
yet appears empty and virtuous,
his demeanor as if foolish.

Lu Jifu said:
All things are measured from it yet it is never depleted—this is fullness.
Yet when added to, it does not increase—
thus it is as if empty.
Only because it is as if empty
is its use ever renewed and inexhaustible.

Luosha said:
Wisdom without accumulation is called fullness.
Empty yet upright—this is called "empty."
Speaking of those who are greatly full,
they forget their fullness,
though full, they appear empty—
empty, they are not depleted.
If their use is thus,
then it has no end.

The moon wanes when full,
the satisfied mind is diminished.
The Perfect One knows the cycles of fullness and emptiness,
yet though full, remains as if empty.

**Great Straightness as if Bent**

Wang Bi said:
To follow things in straightness—
straightness does not lie within oneself—
thus it appears bent.

Luosha said:
Upright in principle, without deviation—this is straightness.
To conform to things in bending—this is bent.
The body may be bent,
but the Dao cannot be bent.
Great straightness is bending the self to extend the Dao.

Goulu Hui was dismissed three times for his straight path yet did not leave.

**Great Skill as if Clumsy**

Su Shi said:
Skill without clumsiness
would labor in its skill—
to entrust to natural spontaneity,
though clumsy, is skillful.

Liu Jinxi said:
The artisan shapes ten thousand things,
the furnace refines all life—
though possessing great skill and function,
they forget their labor,
hide their traces like the common,
thus it is called clumsy.
Skill lies in what is not done,
letting nature form things.
Without artificial crafting, there is no skillful function—
to give form to things, square or round,
straight or curved—
their subtlety is unseen,
thus it appears clumsy.
To carve and refine all forms yet not claim skill—
is this not the proof?

**The Great Skill as if Clumsy**

There is the craftsmanship of Qi Qing’s chiseling the furnace, not like the Song artisan carving mulberry wood.

**Great Eloquence as if Tongue-Tied**

*Commentary:* Silent eloquence is called great eloquence.
Huizi’s many arguments were indeed small.

Luo Shi said:
To encompass all wisdom is great eloquence—
speaking only what is lawful, hence called tongue-tied.

Su Shi said:
Eloquence without tongue-tied speech
would surely exhaust itself.
Speaking in accordance with principle,
though tongue-tied, is eloquent.

**Hot and Cold, Stillness and Motion**

Hot overcomes cold,
stillness overcomes heat—
clearing and tranquil is the norm for all under Heaven.

Lü Jifu said:
Cold and heat are the workings of Heaven and Earth,
inevitable for all things with form.
Yet one moment of agitation can overcome cold,
one moment of stillness can overcome heat—
if a single instance of agitation or stillness
can prevail over Heaven and Earth’s operations,
how much more so the embodied stillness of non-action,
which establishes the norm for all under Heaven?
This chapter first speaks of the great virtues,
concluding with clearing and tranquil as the norm for all under Heaven.

The Old Master said:
Those who attain enlightenment in the Dao
are always clearing and tranquil.
Those who enlighten to the Dao
must be still, must be clear—
only in emptiness can one attain
the above great virtues.

**Chapter Forty-Six: When the World is Governed by the Dao**

When the world is governed by the Dao,
warhorses are driven back to manure fields.

*Commentary:* When rulers govern by the Dao,
the people take joy in their occupations and do not contend—
they merely manure their fields.

"Governed by the Dao" refers to a ruler who follows the Way.
"Driven back" means to withdraw.
"Warhorses" are steeds that gallop.
"Manure" means to fertilize fields.
It speaks of a ruler who governs the world with the Dao—
content with little, knowing sufficiency,
seeking nothing from beyond,
not employing arms or martial arts,
abandoning warfare and cultivating culture,
with no battles or pursuits—
only tending to the fundamental occupations,
thus withdrawing the galloping steeds
to till the fields.

For those cultivating the self,
the mind-horse does not gallop,
and the elixir field fills naturally.

When the world is without the Dao,
warhorses breed in the suburbs.

Wen Gong said:
Insatiable greed, internal strife, external contention.
A ruler without the Dao
indulges in desires, seizes without restraint,
wages war endlessly—
thus warhorses, bred in the suburbs,
remain there for long without return.

"Suburbs" refers to the outskirts of a city.
The restless and competitive
cannot know contentment and sufficiency,
thus they ride their steeds recklessly,
galloping through the suburbs of sensual pleasures.

**No greater crime than desiring what is desirable.**

*Commentary:* If one does not see what is desirable,
the mind remains undisturbed.
When people’s desires reach the point of endangering life and nature,
crime arises from this.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:
When the mind perceives what is desirable,
that is the greatest crime.

Zhang Junxiang said:
When the external scene is beautiful,
the mind calls it "desirable"—
thus it is said.
Yet if the scene can adapt to the mind,
it becomes the cause of crime.
If the cause persists without end,
great crime will surely follow.

**No greater calamity than not knowing sufficiency.**

*Commentary:* Moderation brings fortune,
excess brings calamity.
Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace—
what calamity could there be?

Wang Yuanzhe said:
Endless external seeking,
losing one’s nature and inviting calamity.
Not recognizing the sufficiency of one’s natural endowment,
yet consuming external things—
this leads to suffering and humiliation,
wandering through life and death,
forever sinking in the sea of filth,
eternally losing the true Dao.
No greater calamity exists than this.

**No greater fault than desiring to obtain.**

Da Meng said:
Seeking what is already sufficient,
yet still desiring more—
the heart, having no bounds,
will inevitably invite great fault.

This speaks of those without the Dao,
indulging their nature and emotions,
thus inviting retribution.
Accumulating evil without end,
they burden both life and death,
their punishment confined to themselves—
a crime passed to their descendants,
a fault extending to their ancestors.

Zuan Wei said:
Fault is retribution.
All things that pass before the eyes
still have limits.
Yet those without the Dao,
seeing or unseen,
desire all things,
demanding they all belong to them without remainder—
this is the extreme of those without the Dao.
Not only does calamity befall oneself,
but retribution and fault extend to future generations.

Crime refers to violating prohibitions—
the first offense is called crime,
the Daoist practice of repentance.
The *Classic* says:
The first offense is crime, also called fault.
Fault means error.
Eighteen hundred offenses become calamity,
which is heavier than crime.
Two thousand one hundred sixty offenses become fault,
which is heavier than calamity.
These three—crime, calamity, fault—
are the deeds of those without the Dao.

All things, seen or unseen,
that one desires must be obtained—
desiring and obtaining is what invites fault.
Self-inflicted disaster is crime,
defying the divine brings calamity,
defying others brings fault.
From desiring what is desirable
to not knowing sufficiency,
not knowing sufficiency leads to desiring to obtain.
Crime leads to calamity,
calamity leads to fault,
and fault brings disaster from the multitude.

No greater crime than calamity,
no greater calamity than fault—
this is the natural order.

Thus, sufficiency in knowing sufficiency
is always sufficient.

*Commentary:* When people see what is desirable,
they do not know sufficiency;
not knowing sufficiency leads to desiring to obtain;
desiring to obtain stirs contention and brings chaos.
Thus, when the world is governed by the Dao,
warhorses are driven back to manure fields.
Yet if one knows sufficiency
and each finds contentment in their nature and life,
applying neither cleverness nor skill—
merely fulfilling daily needs in eating and drinking,
what contention or chaos could there be?

King Shū of Chu said:
Mòzǐ said:
"It is not that there is no place to reside,
but that my heart lacks sufficiency.
It is not that there is no wealth,
but that my heart lacks sufficiency.
All things naturally reach sufficiency,
yet there are those who say they lack—
because their hearts lack sufficiency."
Those who attain the Dao know their hearts and wealth are sufficient,
thus it is said:
"Sufficiency in knowing sufficiency
is always sufficient."

Wang Yuanzhe said:
Each fulfills their natural endowment—
what lack could there be?

This chapter speaks of governing the world with the Dao:
internally knowing sufficiency,
externally seeking nothing—
thus ending contention and war,
avoiding calamity and fault.

**玉诀类**

Cultivating the self means few desires and knowing sufficiency—
the mind’s wild steed unbridled no more,
the elixir field guarded within—
then one may be called a man of the Dao.

*Excerpt from the True Classic of Dao and Virtue, Volume Seven of the Collected Goodness of the Song Dynasty*
*Collected by Resident Master Li Lin of Raoyang*
*Chapter Forty-Seventh: Not Leaving the Door*

Not leaving the door, one knows the world.
Not peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.

Wang Huibian said:
The traveler, with an empty heart and inner stillness,
does not let the mind gallop through the world’s affairs,
nor does he labor in grasping at external things.
With true discernment of falsehood,
all matters become thoroughly known.

Lu Tian said:
All things are already complete within me.
There is the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Earth, the Dao of Man.
If one turns inward to seek them without being deceived by the external,
then the Dao of Man can be known without leaving the door,
and the Dao of Heaven can be seen without peering through the window.

Though the world be vast, the sage knows it through the Dao.
Though the Dao of Heaven be distant, the sage sees it with the heart.
When heart and Dao align,
and one observes the world through the Dao,
there is nothing distant that cannot be discerned—
thus, no need to leave the door.
When one sees the Dao of Heaven with the heart,
there is no height it cannot reach—
thus, no need to peer through the window.

Yang Zi said:
How wondrous is the human heart!
When held, it exists; when released, it vanishes.
Who but the sage can constantly hold and preserve it?
The sage preserves the spirit to its utmost,
harmonizing with the juncture of Heaven and Man,
making them unbroken.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.

Cai Zi Huang said:
Those without the Dao cannot examine themselves or know others.
Their minds race after external phenomena—
though they leave the door and travel far,
or peer through windows to gaze at stars,
their knowledge and perception remain scant,
for they abandon themselves to seek without.

Lü Jifu said:
The world is vast, indeed boundless—
if one waits to leave before knowing it,
then the reach of one’s strength is limited,
and how much can one truly know?
The Dao of Heaven is distant, indeed unfathomable—
if one waits to peer before seeing it,
then the reach of one’s sight is limited,
and how much can one truly see?
Thus it is said:
*The farther one goes, the less one knows.*

Wang Yuanzhe said:
The boundless principle is exhausted in a single mote of dust.
No subtle thought arises, all entanglements manifest.
Is not this where the study of the Dao lies?
Yet some seek it afar—how blind they are!
The farther one goes, the less one knows—
is this not so?

Thus the sage acts without going, knows without seeing,
accomplishes without doing.

*Commentary:*
To know the world with one’s wisdom is called *knowing without going*.
To see the Dao of Heaven with one’s heart is called *seeing without peering*.
To know without going, to see without peering—
what need is there for action?
Yet lofty indeed is their accomplishment—
this is called *accomplishing without doing*.
Their knowledge is divine in discerning human affairs—
Emperor Yao and Shun knew the world could be known.
Then the vastness of Heaven and its unity—
Yao and Shun saw the Dao of Heaven could be known.
To know without going, to see without peering—
what need is there for action?
Only to rectify oneself and face south—
thus it is said: *accomplishing without doing*.
This chapter speaks of the Dao itself—
there is the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Man.
Though Heaven and Man differ, their Dao communicates.
The sage aligns heart with Dao,
and though the world be vast,
it can be known without leaving the door.
Though the Dao of Heaven be distant,
it can be seen without peering through the window.
To know without going, to see without peering,
to accomplish without doing.

**Chapter Forty-Eighth: Daily Increase for Learning, Daily Decrease for the Dao**

*Commentary:*
Learning seeks to attain the Dao—
beginning as a scholar, ending as a sage.
Daily increase accumulates within oneself.
Confucius said to Yan Yuan:
*"I see his progress—
the seeker of the Dao discards limbs and senses,
abandons form and intelligence,
and all affairs dissolve into forgetfulness—
thus it is called *decrease*."*

Lian Boyu thus lived sixty years and transformed sixty times.
Those who cultivate the True begin as scholars seeking the Dao,
and end as sages who have attained it.
While striving in learning to exhaust principles,
and examining all things to seek harmony,
it is called *increase*.
For the Dao, one exhausts nature and reaches supreme emptiness—
all things are known to be false,
and though one does not intend to decrease,
all that was gradually fades away.

First speaking of the learner—
if one does not learn, one cannot clearly see goodness,
nor firmly believe in the Dao,
and thus cannot govern it.
Having attained the Dao, one must abandon learning—
if one does not abandon learning,
then the more one hears and sees, the more one drowns in excess,
and the heart cannot embody the Dao—
thus later speaking of *daily decrease for the Dao*.

Thus it is said:
*Beginning with learning to attain the Dao,*
*ending with attaining the Dao to abandon learning—*
*then one is a fully true man.*

Decrease again, and again decrease,
until reaching *wuwei* [non-action].

Cheng Xuanying said:
The learner clings to desires.
The man of the Dao lingers in *wuwei*.
Though shallow and deep differ,
both are forms of stagnation.
Now to dispel these two fixations,
there is the text of *double decrease*—
first to decrease the *having*,
then to decrease the *non-having*—
both extremes of learning and Dao are cast aside,
neither *having* nor *non-having*—
this is the single accord.

Shu Wang said:
To exhaust principles and fulfill nature,
one must return to the original command.
Thus *decrease again, and again decrease*,
until reaching *wuwei*—
this is returning to the command.
Yet the command is not hastily restored—
one must first exhaust and then restore,
only then reaching the command—
thus it is said:
*Decrease again, and again decrease*,
until reaching *wuwei*.

Lü Jifu said:
To decrease is still to engage in action.
To decrease even the act of decreasing,
only then reaching *wuwei*—
*wuwei* yet nothing remains undone.

Luó Shì said:
To decrease is to have no surplus to discard,
to discard until reaching forgetfulness of evil.

Then there is nothing so slight that it is not removed,
until the act of removal reaches the forgetting of good.

Evil is not; good is.
Having already diminished the "not," one must also diminish the "is,"
thus it is said: *Decrease again, and again decrease.*

When both "is" and "not" are forgotten,
and passions are severed,
virtue and Dao unite—
reaching *wuwei*.

Though one’s own actions are *wuwei*,
one lets all things act of their own accord—
thus nothing remains undone.

Wang Bi said:
To act is to lose something;
thus *wuwei* is to lose nothing.

Lü Jifu said:
The "non-having" is merely the absence of having;
the "not undone" is the means by which one transcends non-having—
this is called *Absolute Learning, No Worry*.

The scholar accumulates what they lack;
the Daoist diminishes what they possess.
To diminish is to diminish what one possesses,
yet even this act of diminishing retains a diminishing mind.
Only when one diminishes even this mind
does one reach *wuwei*.

Silent and unmoving,
yet nothing remains undone—
responding and thus harmonizing with the Way of all things.

The *Classic* says:
*The Dao acts without doing yet nothing remains undone.*

To govern the world,
one must act without action.
Liu Zhongping said:
Confucius praised Yao, saying:
*"Broad and boundless—people cannot name it."*
He praised Shun, saying:
*"He ruled without action;*
*his rule reached such heights*
*that the people said he acted naturally."*

If one does not act without action
to govern the world,
how could one attain this?

*Wuwei* is the true Dao.
The Sage embodies the true Dao.
The world returns to his embrace—
this is how *wuwei* governs the world.
When one acts with affairs,
it is insufficient to govern the world.

*Commentary*:
The world is a great thing.
One who possesses great things
cannot treat all things as things
without being treated as a thing—
thus they can treat all things as things.
Therefore, to govern the world,
one must act without action.

The world is a divine instrument—
it cannot be forced.
Those who force it ruin it;
those who grasp it lose it.
Thus, when one acts with affairs,
it is insufficient to govern the world.

The Sage embodies the Dao
and governs with its truth.
When the Emperor arises,
the King emerges,
responding in harmony—
the world will naturally submit.

The Duke of Zhou and Confucius
left their homelands
and established their states beneath the Qishan peaks.

Tang Minghuang said:
To act with affairs is to labor;
labor leads to decay—
thus it is insufficient to govern the world.

This chapter begins by saying:
The scholar seeks to attain the Dao.
To attain the Dao is to forget the mind,
thus *decrease again, and again decrease*,
until reaching *wuwei* and *wuwei*.

*Wuwei* is the constant Dao;
*wuwei* is the true Dao—
this is how one governs the world.

The *Western Ascension Classic* says:
*Wuwei and wuwei—*
*the state is prosperous, the people are rich.*

**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Fixed Mind**

The Sage has no fixed mind,
taking the people’s mind as their own.

*Commentary*:
The Sage’s mind is the illumination of all things.
Empty yet receptive,
still yet responsive—
like a mirror reflecting forms,
adapting to beauty and ugliness;
like a valley echoing sounds,
responding to loud and soft.
How could there be any fixed mind?

Observing all things reveals their nature;
following the people is all—
this is called taking the people’s mind as one’s own.

Zhuangzi said:
*"The people are lowly—*
*one cannot but follow them."*

Liu Jinxi said:
The people are the collective term for all.
Yet the Sage, having no mind,
responds when touched—
responses follow things as they are touched—
thus they take the people’s mind as their own.

Having no mind to respond,
yet nothing remains unresponded to.

The good, I treat as good;
the ungood, I also treat as good—
virtue is good.
The trustworthy, I trust;
the untrustworthy, I also trust—
virtue is trust.

*Commentary*:
Good and evil contradict each other;
truth and falsehood mock each other—
these are the common sentiments of the world,
self-made distinctions.
How could this be virtue?

Virtue as good means seeing all actions as good,
so even the ungood is treated as good.
Virtue as trust means seeing all emotions as trustworthy,
so even the untrustworthy is treated as trustworthy.

True and false are both forgotten,
right and wrong are unified—
this is called the person of perfect virtue.

Wang Yuanzhe said:
Good and evil arise from delusion;
delusion arises from self-interest.
If one is impartial to the Great Dao,
even when seeing good and evil with one’s eyes,
the mind holds no differing thoughts.
Thus the Sage, following the world’s sentiments,
artificially establishes praise and blame,
yet knows that good and evil are originally not opposed—
not out of pity or tolerance,
but because one unconsciously sees no difference.

To forget the reality of good and evil is true goodness.
Thus all phenomena, though differing,
are equal in their true nature.
Trust and distrust arise from self-interest.
Knowing all appearances are delusion,
one sees the ungood as good;
knowing all appearances are real,
one sees the untrustworthy as trustworthy.

When delusion is known as reality,
and reality is known as delusion—
this is how the Sage’s wisdom differs from the common people.

The Sage moves among the people,
ever vigilant,
harmonizing their heart with the world.

*Commentary*:
When in the world,
the Sage shares in the people’s joys and sorrows—
though having no fixed mind,
one cannot but be cautious.
Thus, for oneself, one is ever vigilant,
never at ease;
for the world, one unifies good and evil,
forgets truth and falsehood,
and closes the door to praise—
harmonized, and that is all.

Cai Zixiang said:
With teaching that has no distinctions,
one blends hearts that have distinctions.
Since people have good and ungood,
trust and distrust,
and make dual distinctions,
the Sage appears to all as good and trustworthy—
ultimately, all is unified in mystery,
thus it is said: *harmonized*.

Wang Yuanzhe said:
*Vigilant* means fearful.
The people fix their ears and eyes on the Sage;
the Sage treats them like children.

Wang Yuanzhe said:
Looking up to emulate them,
the ignorant people’s every move is illogical.
The Sage pities and guides them,
like parents to an infant—
gentle and accommodating to their nature,
without anger or resentment.
Who but one who embodies the Dao,
forgets things,
and is as vast as Heaven and Earth,
could do this?

This chapter speaks of the Sage embodying the Dao without thought,
thus forgetting good and evil,
equalizing trust and distrust,
and when in the world, vigilant yet never daring to stray.
As for governing the world,
the Sage simply blends all and that is all.

The people look up and follow them,
heeding only the Sage’s vision and hearing.
When the Sage meets them,
treats them with kindness and generosity,
even those who are not good or trustworthy
become so—
this is the way of nurturing them like children.

Out of ten people,
three are those who preserve life,
three are those who hasten death,
and three, though desiring life,
unwittingly rush toward death.
Those who preserve life
do so by indulging in life to excess,
while those who hasten death
do so by clinging to emptiness and neglecting the body.

The ten who rush toward death
are those who move in perilous ways—
the gallows loom before them,
prisons stare them in the face.
All these forget that the body is their greatest affliction,
that life is limited,
yet cling to it too heavily.
The ancient ones who attained the Dao
neither let wealth and honor harm their bodies
nor let poverty and humiliation burden their forms.
They do not rejoice in longevity,
nor lament in early death.
They awaken in solitude,
and thus can transcend time
and enter the realm of neither death nor life.

The *Classic* says:
People who lightly regard death
do so because their attachment to life is too great—
thus they lightly rush toward death.
Only those who do not cling to life
are wiser than those who value it.

For those who excel in preserving life,
River Master said:
*"Preserving"* means nurturing.
Zhuangzi did not speak of preserving life himself,
but said *"those who hear"*—
a humble phrase.
*"Preserving"* also means guarding.
Within guarding life, one grasps its subtle essence,
thus it is said: *those who excel in preserving life*.

They walk on land but do not meet rhinoceros or tigers,
enter armies but are not struck by weapons.
River Master said:
Walking on land yet not meeting rhinoceros or tigers,
naturally avoids harm, not engaging with it.
Entering armies yet not struck by weapons,
does not delight in killing others through war.

Chen Xuanjing said:
This shows the three poisons cannot harm them—
if one preserves life without clinging to life,
harm cannot harm.
Since they have no internal three poisons,
external three poisons cannot harm them,
thus they walk on land yet do not meet rhinoceros or tigers,
enter armies yet are not struck by weapons.

Why?
For tigers embody anger,
rhinoceroses embody delusion,
weapons embody greed.
The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,
the tiger no place to set its claws,
the weapons no place to lodge their blades.

Shu Wang said:
Only those who excel in preserving life
can be without self.
Without self, they do no harm to others,
and others cannot harm them.

Zhuangzi said:
If a person can empty themselves and wander through the world,
who could harm them?
Why?
Because they have no deathly realm.

「Wang Yuanzé said:
Those who have no deathly realm do so because they have no realm of birth.
For those without birth, they are ever serene and alive,
yet do not cling to their own life—
thus they never die, nor do they ever truly live.
When the Dao reaches this state,
even though their form may have *meditation* (禅),
their spirit never alters—
how could death come to them?
This is the sacred and divine of the Central Realm,
and the Buddha of the Western Land.

If one were to change and fluctuate without constancy,
water and fire could not scorch or drench them,
axes and saws could not wound or sicken them.
They ride the void yet touch the solid,
and go where none can pass—
then desires of the world cannot grasp them,
how much more could they harm?

Someone said:
Then why call them *preserving life* (摄生)?
They replied:
Descend one degree from this,
and you enter the realm of birth-and-death.
All who preserve life must reach this state first,
then life remains ever constant.
This is akin to the profound virtue of those who contain *virtue/power* (德).
Wen Gong said:
The rhinoceros and tiger are metaphors for the strong and violent.
Those who dwell among the strong and violent yet suffer no harm
do so because they are gentle, weak, and do not contend.

Luo Shi said:
*Realm* (地) is akin to *birth* (生).
Because they preserve life without clinging to birth,
the three poisons cannot harm them.
This chapter speaks of the Dao of life-and-death,
expressed in ten words,
each containing three meanings within.

Only those who excel in preserving life
have the Dao unified in one,
transcending these three categories—
even rhinoceroses, tigers, swords, and armies
dare not harm them,
thus it is said they have no deathly realm.

**Chapter 51: The Dao Gives Birth (道生之)**
The Dao gives birth to them,
*Virtue/Power* (德) nurtures them,
things take form,
and circumstances complete them.

*Commentary*: Once form and substance are complete,
the body and its circumstances are established—
the relative shapes of long and short,
high and low, are thus determined.
Lu Jiufu said:
The birth of all things
is always rooted in the *nameless* (无名),
while their nurturing lies in the *one* yet unformed (一而未形),
at the moment when things begin to take shape.
The *nameless* is the Dao,
the *one* yet unformed, which allows things to be born, is *Virtue/Power* (德).
When they become things,
they are merely forms—
not the means by which they were born and nurtured.
Once forms are manifest,
the naked must remain naked,
those with scales, shells, feathers, or fur must remain so,
and the young, the mature, the old, and the dying
cannot escape their respective stages—
all these are the inevitable consequences of circumstances.
Thus it is said:
*The Dao gives birth to them,
Virtue/Power nurtures them,
things take form,
and circumstances complete them.*

The Dao gives birth to spirit,
Virtue/Power distributes *qi* (气),
and through its flowing motion, it gives rise to things—
when things are born and their nature established, that is *form* (形).
Thus all things reverence the Dao
and honor Virtue/Power.

Lu Jiufu said:
Circumstances arise from form,
form arises from Virtue/Power,
and Virtue/Power arises from the Dao.
The Dao and Virtue/Power are the root,
form and circumstances are the branches—
the root is revered while the branches are held low,
the root is honored while the branches are despised—
thus all things reverence the Dao
and honor Virtue/Power.

The Dao is the origin from which all things come,
descending as the pure essence that births and nurtures them.
Virtue/Power is what things receive,
abandoning harmony to cultivate their forms.
When the Dao gives birth to things and acts as their father,
the Dao is revered while things are held low.
Revered, it can overcome and diminish things.
This is what Zhuangzi called *True Sovereign* (真君).

When Virtue/Power nurtures things and acts as their mother,
Virtue/Power is honored while things are held low—
thus things cannot despise it.
This is what Zhuangzi called *True Ruler* (真宰).
The reverence of the Dao,
the honor of Virtue/Power—
none can bestow these titles,
yet they are ever naturally so.

Emperor Ming of Tang said:
Speaking of the reverence and honor of the Dao and Virtue/Power,
it is not conferred by external titles or commands,
but by the inherent function of giving birth and nurturing,
which is ever naturally revered and honored.

Wang Yuanzé said:
If one’s life is decreed by Heaven, they become the Son of Heaven;
if decreed by the Son of Heaven, they become a feudal lord—
wherever life is received from another,
the giver can hold them low.
Only the Dao precedes all things
and governs their life—
who could confer rank upon it?
Thus it is ever naturally revered.

Therefore, the Dao gives birth, nurtures, lengthens, and matures them,
completes and covers them.
This is profound!

When all things transform and change,
the Dao gives birth with them;
when all things gather and hide,
the Dao completes them.
It emerges from *Zhen* (震),
is established in *Gèn* (艮),
is nurtured in *Kūn* (坤),
and is covered in *Qián* (乾).
The interplay of the firm and the yielding
grinds through the eight *trigrams* (卦),
as though bound by a mechanism yet unable to resist—
the Dao truly transcends them.

*Zhuǎn Wēi* said:
The previous passage spoke of the Dao giving birth and Virtue/Power nurturing.
Here, Virtue/Power is not mentioned,
for the Dao’s single *qi* (气) permeates all without distinction,
and the text omits the elaboration of Virtue/Power.

To receive its essence is to be born,
to contain its *qi* is to be nurtured,
to fulfill its form is to grow,
to mark its *village* (村) is to mature—
*Commentary*: This likely refers to the stages of life, not a literal village.
To aid its function is to complete,
to reach its end is to be perfected,
to preserve its harmony is to be nourished,
to shield its harm is to be covered.
These eight aspects
are the primordial functions of the Great Dao.
How could even the smallest living creature
fail to revere and honor it?

To be born yet not possess its function,
to act yet not rely on its ability,
to grow yet not claim dominion—
this is called *Mysterious Virtue/Power* (玄德).

*Commentary*: When the Dao gives birth to all things,
if it were to show ownership,
it would limit its benevolence.
When it nurtures all things,
if it were to claim its actions,
it would dwell in its own works.
When it grows and matures all creatures,
completes and perfects all kinds,
and sustains both living and non-living—
if it were to boast its sovereignty,
it would occupy its own length.
Such withdrawal into hidden depths
can be called profound and distant *hidden virtue/power* (阴德).

Emperor Ming of Tang said:
This summarizes all eight meanings from above.
The Dao’s birth to all things,
if it were to reveal itself as having,
would be constrained by its own benevolence.
Its nurturing of all things,
if it were to rely on its own actions,
would be limited by its own functions.
Its growth and maturation of all creatures,
its completion and perfection of all kinds,
its sustenance of both living and non-living—
if it were to arrogate its rule,
it would be bound by its own length.
Thus, in possessing these qualities yet withdrawing into secrecy,
its virtue is profound indeed,
and its reach is distant.
As it was explained in the *Chapter on Nourishing the Vital Essence* (载营魄章).」

The chapter states that the person’s cultivation aligns with the Dao,
and this chapter speaks of the Dao’s application mirroring humanity.

This chapter expounds on how **virtue/power** (德) and **Dao/Way** (道) bring forth and nurture all things,
and how all things revere the **Dao’s virtue/power** (道德).
The Dao is supremely honored,
its virtue is supremely noble—
who could bestow rank upon it?
It remains ever naturally,
and that is all.

Yet when spoken of separately,
they exhibit distinct qualities.
When spoken of together,
they both arise from the Dao.
Thus, it concludes with *hidden virtue/power* (玄德).

Hence, one who understands the Dao’s **virtue/power** (德) and **Dao/Way** (道) as unified,
sees their profound mystery as one.

**Chapter on the Origin of All Things (天下有始章) – Fifty-Second**

All things have an origin,
and this is called the **origin of all things** (天下有始),
the **Mother of All Things** (天下母).
Lu Jiufu said:
*"All things have an origin,
and this is called the **Mother of All Things**—
then the *Classic* speaks of 'five'?
I do not know its name,
but this is the Dao."*

The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.
The named is the **Mother of all things** (万物之母).
The Dao is always nameless,
yet it serves as the **Mother of All Things**—
why so?
For though the named may suffice as the **Mother of all things**,
it is not enough to be the **Mother of All Things** itself.
The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth—
from Heaven downward,
all things are born from the nameless.
Thus, it is said:
*"All things have an origin,
and this is called the **Mother of All Things**."*

The **origin** (始) is the Dao.
The Dao is the **Mother of all things** (万物母).
The **origin** and the **Mother** are both the Dao.
From the beginning of its *qi*,
it is called the **origin**.
From its eternal nurturing,
it is called the **Mother**.
Once there is an **origin**,
it can give rise to eternal nurturing.
Having obtained the **Mother**,
one knows its offspring.
**御注**: *"The Dao, as the **Mother of all things**,
names them—thus, things are its offspring.
Those who are attuned to the Dao
comprehend both the **Mother** and the offspring.
Thus, having known the **Mother**,
one knows its offspring."*

Wang Yuanzhe said:
*"All things emerge from the Dao,
the Dao is their **Mother**,
and things are their offspring.
Gaining the Dao,
one understands the principles of all things
without needing to discern them.
Having known the offspring,
one must then preserve the **Mother**—
He Shangong said:
*'Having understood the principles of all things under Heaven,
one must then preserve the Dao and return to non-action,
so that one’s life ends without peril.'*
Wang Yuanzhe said:
*'If, after seeing the principles,
one follows them without returning to the Dao,
then one acts recklessly and invites disaster—
far from the Dao indeed.
Thus, knowing the offspring while preserving the **Mother**,
one is ever free from peril.
Having known the offspring,
one must then preserve the Dao,
abandoning clever scheming
to return to ignorance
and safeguard oneself—
thus, one is free from all danger of ruin.
Close its **ui** (兑), shut its **door** (门),
and one’s life will never be weary.
He Shangong said:
*'**Ui** (兑) is the eyes—
let the eyes not gaze recklessly.
**Door** (门) is the mouth—
let the mouth not speak recklessly.'*
Lu Jiufu said:
*'This is the meaning of preserving the **Mother**.
When the heart stirs within,
and one indulges it,
this is called having **ui** (兑).
If one has **ui**,
the heart will stray outward,
and one will lose distinction between self and things—
thus, close its **ui** and keep it sealed,
and the heart will not stray outward.
When things draw one’s attention externally,
and one accepts them,
this is called having a **door** (门).
If one has a **door**,
things will enter and disturb the heart,
so shut its **door** and do not accept them—
and things will not enter.
The heart does not stray outward,
things do not enter—
though all things change,
and myriad transformations unfold before one,
each returns to its root,
yet one remains unaware.
How then could one be weary?'*

Open its **ui** (兑), further its affairs,
and one’s life will never be saved.
Shu Wang said:
*"The opposite of 'saved' (没) is 'to exist' (存).
The opposite of 'beginning' (终) is 'end' (始).
When paired with 'door' (门),
'further its affairs' (济其事) implies
that the **door** is not shut—
thus, affairs do not remain sealed.
If one further its affairs,
then the **door** is not shut—
this is clear."*

Pei Chu’en said:
*"Opening the **ui** of the five desires,
furthering the affairs of the six dusts,
wearies the spirit within,
fatigues the senses without—
this is lifelong labor and exhaustion."*

**Seeing the Small as Clarity (见小曰明)**
**纂微曰**: *"This means preventing issues before they arise,
and addressing them before they become chaotic.
If one knows the art of closing **ui** and shutting **door**,
then one sees the small and subtle—
seeing the small and subtle,
one’s affairs cannot grow dim;
this is called clarity.
For only those who preserve the **Mother**
ever see the stirrings of their hearts.
The small and subtle are the Dao’s subtleties—
seeing the Dao’s subtleties,
one knows oneself alone—
thus, there is no lack of clarity."*

**Preserving Softness as Strength (守柔曰强)**
Zhang Junxiang said:
*"Following the Dao without resistance is softness;
beginning and ending without loss is strength."*
Lu Jiufu said:
*"Preserving the formless utmost softness,
and no thing can overcome it."*

**Using Its Light, Returning to Its Clarity (用其光，复归其明)**
**御注**: *"Clarity (明) is the essence of light.
Light (光) is the manifestation of clarity.
When the Sage responds to the world,
clarity manifests as light—
thus, brilliance is light.
Gathering light back into clarity,
wisdom penetrates as clarity.
Displaying all virtues outwardly,
while concealing their applications—
like the sun and moon illuminating all things,
each thing is clear and bright,
yet nothing is diminished—
this is how the Sage’s **virtue/power** (德) is divine and profound."*

He Shangong said:
*"Using its light outwardly,
one must then return its clarity inwardly,
lest the spirit be depleted.
Avoiding harm to oneself,
this is called *clinging to constancy* (袭常)."*
**御注**: *"The transformations of things are without constancy.
Only those who return to their original nature
abandon things and separate from humanity,
and return to their clarity,
without transforming along with things—
their essence remains constant,
free from peril,
differing from those who merge with form and become light."*

Gu Huan said:
*"If one opens its **ui**,
furthering its affairs,
disaster and blame will surely come.
Yet this disaster is not external calamity—
it is self-inflicted harm.
Reflecting light inward,
observing the spirit within,
not allowing it to leak away,
then one’s life will never suffer disaster and blame—
this is called the *path of profound constancy and enduring duration* (密合常久之道)."*

This chapter centers on the principle of preserving the **Mother**.
The Dao is the **Mother of all things**,
and all things are the Dao’s offspring.
Closing **ui**, shutting **door**,
seeing the small, preserving softness—
even to the point of responding to things,
using light, and returning to clarity—
all are the principle of preserving the **Mother**.
Thus, its Dao remains ever constant,
free from disaster and blame—
this is the *path of profound constancy and enduring truth* (密用真常之道).

**Chapter on the Sage’s Isolation (使我介然章) – Fifty-Third**

*"The Sage stands alone, with knowledge,
walking the Great Dao—
only the **Way** (施) does he fear."*

「Lu Tian said: The Dao is preserved by having no desires,
and is practiced by having no knowledge,
thus it is said: *"The Sage stands alone, with knowledge,
walking the Great Dao—
only the **Way** (施) does he fear."*

Indeed, one with knowledge,
within cannot avoid pride,
without cannot avoid partiality,
thus when he acts, he has something to fear.
**Isolation** (介) is small yet discerning,
knowing little of things,
yet following the Dao with greatness.

The Dao, when practiced by one who knows,
is already cautious of **bestowal** (施设).
How much more so for one with great knowledge?
For the **Perfect Person’s Dao** (至人之道),
does not allow the superficial to harm the fundamental.

If **bestowal** (施) is excessive externally,
then the inner **roots** (根本) will be depleted.
Thus, those walking the Great Dao
do not nurture trifling concerns,
and all entanglements are abandoned;
there is no room for **isolated knowledge** (介然之知).

**Yin Que** asked **Wang Ni**,
four questions posed, four answers unknown.
The Great Dao is most **level** (夷),
yet people love **shortcuts** (径).

Lu Tian said: A **shortcut** (径) is not the path,
taking shortcuts while hastening brings affliction.
**Level** (夷) means plain and easy.
A **shortcut** (径) is crooked, not upright.
People are confused,
abandoning the Great Dao and not following it,
preferring crooked shortcuts to seek swiftness,
desiring speed to invite near-term success,
using knowledge to seek the Dao while drifting farther from it.

Moreover, how could they know
that the Great Dao is attained by **knowing without knowing** (以不知而知),
that is the most **level** (夷) of all?
People instead wish to seek it through knowledge,
loving shortcuts while unaware of their inner harm.

**Dan Tai Mie Ming** (澹台灭明),
walking without shortcuts,
is thus walking the Great Dao.

The harms of shortcuts are fully detailed below:

**Morning affairs are most neglected** (朝甚除),
Gu Xuan said: *除* (除) means to **overindulge** (修).
Those who love shortcuts
consider only the **overindulgence of courtly affairs** (修朝) as good.

The **palaces of Zhou**, the **Chang Hua of Chu**, the **Ai Fang of Qin**—
all are examples of this.

**Fields are most overgrown** (田甚芜),
He Shang Gong said: High towers and pavilions,
courtly affairs **overindulged** (修),
farm work abandoned,
not plowing and tilling in season.

Gu Xuan said: When grass grows tall, it is called *overgrown* (芜).
*Overgrown* (芜) means **neglect and ruin** (荒废).
If one indulges in **carved halls and painted walls** (峡宇雕墙),
exhausting wealth and beauty to the utmost,
then human effort is drained,
fields lie **neglected and ruined** (芜荒),
inner **clarity** (明) is **sacrificed for outward fame and gain** (徇名好利),
abandoning little for much,
**Dao practice and alchemical work** (道业) are not cultivated,
the **elixir field** (丹田) lies **neglected and ruined**.

Many fields lie **ruined** (荒),
this is why the *Book of Songs* (《诗》) censures **King You of the Shang** (幽王).
**Granaries are most empty** (仓甚虚),

Shu Wang said: *除* (除) means **governance** (治).
Though courtly affairs are **governed** (治),
fields instead become **ruined** (芜),
granaries instead become **empty** (虚).
Granaries are the **roots** (本).
Now they are **ruined and empty** (芜虚),
this is from people abandoning the Great Dao
and rushing toward shortcuts.

Wang Yuanze said: When fields are **governed** (治),
granaries are filled,
this is the **root** (本) of a state.
Now they instead **overindulge** (务除) in courtly affairs,
for the sake of short-term splendor,
while not heeding that the **roots have already been depleted** (根本之已竭),
how could this be the **path of enduring duration** (持久之道)?

Those who **sacrifice clarity for superficial gain** (以末伤本者),
are all like this.

**Wearing ornate attire** (服文彩),
He Shang Gong said: **Loving false adornment and outward splendor** (好饰伪，贵外华).
**Green and red** (青赤) are **patterns** (文),
**varied silks** (色丝) are **embroidery** (采).

**Carrying sharp swords** (带利剑),
Cheng Xuan Ying said: **Intricately embroidered robes** (黼黻文绣)
are worn to **adorn the body** (丽其身).
**Dryad’s and Mo Chai’s blades** (干将镆铘)
are carried to **guard one’s life** (卫其命).

**Sated with food and drink** (厌饮食),
yet **wealth and goods remain in excess** (财货有余).」

「Han Fei said: When one enters a state, its **governance and teachings** (政教) can be discerned.

If the **courtly halls** (朝阙) are **fastidiously adorned** (甚修除),
and the **palace walls** (墙宇) are **elaborately carved** (甚雕峻),
then one knows the **state’s ruler** (国君) **loves grand constructions** (好土木之功)
and **indulges in frivolous pleasures** (多游嬉之娱).

If the **fields and pastures** (田野) are **barren and neglected** (甚荒芜),
and **agricultural labor is forsaken** (农事失耕治),
then one knows the ruler **relishes forced labor** (好力役),
**seizing the people’s time** (夺民时).

If the **granaries** (仓廪) are **empty and void** (甚空虚),
and **farmers perish from hunger** (农夫多殍饿),
then one knows the ruler **prizes superficial pursuits** (好末作),
**abandoning foundational livelihoods** (废本业).

If **garments are rich in patterns and embroidery** (衣服多文采),
**coarse fabrics are discarded in favor of ornate ones** (质丧而贵华),
then one knows the ruler **delights in licentious craftsmanship** (好淫巧),
**exhausting female artisans** (蠹女工).

If **all who wear sashes carry sharp blades** (佩带皆利剑),
**rigid and fierce in their rivalry for combat** (刚强而竞斗),
then one knows the ruler **cherishes martial prowess** (好武勇),
**breeding state calamities** (生国患).

If **feasting is marked by gluttony** (饮食常厌饮),
**rich broths are savored and fresh meats struck** (烹肥而击鲜),
then one knows the ruler **indulges in drunkenness and satiety** (好醉饱),
**neglecting the people’s affairs** (忘民事).

If **wealth and goods are always in excess** (财货常有余),
and **treasures of rare and exotic things are hoarded** (务多藏珍异),
then one knows the ruler **relishes accumulation and extortion** (好聚敛),
**burdening the people’s resources** (困民财).

**Master Zhongni** (仲尼) said: *"If the common folk lack sustenance, how can the ruler be abundant?"* (百姓不足，君孰与足)
This is the very meaning.

**Emperor Tang Ming Huang** (唐明皇) said:
*"Rich broths and fresh meats are struck—
I weigh the flavors heavily,
and gluttony sates my appetite."* (烹肥击鲜，重滋味，厌饮足也)
*"Accumulated wealth and stored goods abound with rare treasures."* (聚敛积实饶珍异)

**Wang Yuanze** (王元泽) said:
*"Lavish expenditure on externals
to seek fleeting gratification,
while neglecting foundational livelihoods—
this is the clear case of one who **loves wasteful display** (好施) **to harm the roots** (以伤本)."* (此明好施以伤本者)
One text reads: *"**Loves wasteful display** (好施) **to harm the people’s wealth** (以伤货财)."* (一本作货财)

**Zhou** (纣) **filled the Lu Tai Treasury** (实鹿台之财)
with **abundant millet** (盈巨桥之栗).
This is called **"robbery and boast"** (盗夸),
but is it truly robbery? (非盗也哉)

**Luo Shi** (罗什) said:
*"Taking what is not one’s own is **theft** (盗),
boasting of one’s own abilities is **vanity** (夸).*
*The thief **plunders secretly** (阴取於人) **and fears detection** (畏人知).
Yet these seven matters—
all **pursue superficial gains while forgetting the roots** (徇末忘本),
**take what is not their own** (取非其有),
and **do not conceal their excesses** (仍不自隐密),
**flaunting them before others** (夸大於人)—
this is called **"robbery and boast"** (盗夸).

**If one boasts yet cannot endure** (矜),
**how can this persist?** (岂能持久)
Thus, it is said: *"This is not the **Dao/Way**."* (非道)

This chapter speaks of those who **walk in the Great **Dao/Way** (行於大道者),
yet **do not stand firmly** (不可介然).
If they **know a little** (有知) **and claim to know more** (若小有所知),
then their **actions flourish outwardly** (施为盛於外),
while their **roots wither inwardly** (根本虚於内).
This is to **abandon the Great **Dao/Way** in favor of perverse paths** (弃大道而趋邪径).

The **Great **Dao/Way** is the root** (大道者本也).
When **superficial pursuits flourish** (末盛), the **root decays** (则本衰).
All the following passages **illustrate how superficial excess harms the root** (皆以末伤本而施之过也).»

*(End of **Dao De Zheng Jing Qu Shan Ji** Volume 8 / Volume 9)*

「The **Chapter on the Unshaken Foundation of Virtue/Power** (善建者不拔章第五十四):

**A foundation of virtue/power that is not shaken** (善建者不拔),
**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *The foundation is unshaken because it encompasses both the upper and lower aspects* (建中以该上下故不拔).
**Explanation by Jie Jie:** *It speaks of those who embody the virtuous person (君子), establishing their body and mind with virtue/power and the Dao/Way. If they lack virtue/power to display, and no traces remain to be seen, then their roots are deep and their foundation firm, and they are not pulled away by the winds of right and wrong, desire or evil. If, however, those who establish virtue/power seek fame by cutting down virtue/power, flaunt their deeds to gain reward, and though their outward virtues are displayed, their hidden merit is not cultivated, they will ultimately be uprooted by the impermanent obstacles of karma. Thus, the **Huainanzi** says: "A foundation of virtue/power is seen in one's appearance. Gold is consumed by fire, fire is extinguished by water, water is blocked by earth, wood is felled by an axe. Only that which is founded upon the foundationless (無建者) cannot be uprooted."*

**Those who embrace virtue/power do not lose it** (善抱者不脱),
**Annotations by Zuan Wei:** *Those who embrace the Dao/Way to hold the unity of the primal essence (元), then their vital essence and spirit (精神) remain whole and do not slip away.*
**Commentary by Shū Wáng:** *To embrace (抱) is to be one (一). If one embraces unity and does not depart from it, then there is no loss.*
**Sacrifices by descendants never cease.**
**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *The foundation is centered within the Dao/Way and not external to it; embracing unity without separation from vital essence. If one is such, how could their influence be confined to a single state or generation? Rather, it will extend to the whole world and future ages, its transmission far indeed.*
**Commentary by Tang Emperor Xuanzong:** *It speaks of a ruler who establishes virtue/power and embraces the Dao/Way, whose merit extends to posterity, cherishing the sweet osmanthus trees (甘棠) for their descendants. For rulers, their ancestors have merit, and their lineage has virtue/power. Thus, the rise of the Zhou began with Hou Ji and was completed by King Wen and King Wu. The Zhou sacrifices were made to Hou Ji at the outer altars (郊祀), and to King Wen at the ancestral temples (宗祀). Though divination predicted a change after thirty generations, and a span of seven hundred years, the destruction of the temple's main deity (毁庙之主) and the scattering of its influence (流溢於外), the sacrifices to Hou Ji and King Wen at the outer altars and ancestral temples never ceased.*

**Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true** (修之身，其德乃真);
**Commentary by Dù Biàn:** *Illustrate the near cultivation and distant establishment of the Dao/Way in oneself, so that it does not slip away, and its roots are firm. Cultivating oneself in this way, true virtue/power lies within oneself.*

**Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue/power overflows** (修之家，其德乃余);
**Commentary by Hé Shàng Gōng:** *In a family that cultivates the Dao/Way, the father is benevolent, the son is filial, the elder brother is friendly, the younger brother is obedient, the husband is trustworthy, and the wife is chaste. Such virtue/power overflows indeed.*
**Commentary by Wáng Bì:** *This extends from oneself to others.*

**Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue/power overflows; cultivate it in the family, and its virtue/power becomes long-lasting.**
**Cultivate it in the community, and its virtue/power becomes abundant;**
**Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue/power becomes plentiful;**
**Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal.**
**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true. This is the Dao/Way’s true virtue/power to govern oneself. Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue/power overflows. Cultivate it in the community, and its virtue/power becomes long-lasting. This is the surplus extending to govern others. Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue/power becomes abundant. Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal. This is the straight path to govern the world and its states. The farther one cultivates, the broader its virtue/power becomes. Within oneself, it is all true. In others, it is merely the superficial aspect. Thus, overflowing leads to long-lasting, and abundant leads to universal—these are external to the Dao/Way.*

**Annotations by Zuan Wei:** *These five stages begin with near cultivation of oneself and extend far to the world. Thus, observe oneself to understand oneself; observe the family to understand the family...*

**Commentary by Dào Chōng:** *Examine the gains and losses, right and wrong of oneself, and one will know all people. Examine the harmony or discord, prosperity or decline of one’s family, and one will know other families.*

**Observe the community to understand the community; observe the state to understand the state; observe the world to understand the world.**
**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *All things are complete within me. Reflecting sincerely upon oneself, no greater joy exists. Thus, by observing oneself to understand oneself, one’s self is governed. Extending this analogy...*

**The world has its constants, yet by observing them, the world is governed.**
**Annotations by Zuan Wei:** *To observe is to scrutinize and reflect. Thus, by the Dao/Way of sage-rulers (先、圣) to govern oneself, reflect upon my own body and mind. If my body and mind can embody the Dao/Way, then its virtue/power is true. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the family, reflect upon my own family. If my family can harmonize their relationships, then its virtue/power overflows. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the community, reflect upon my own neighbors. If my neighbors can trust in their friends, then its virtue/power becomes long-lasting. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the state, reflect upon my own citizens. If my citizens can fulfill their lives, then its virtue/power becomes abundant. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the world, reflect upon all the people in the world. If they can be without desire and without knowledge, then its virtue/power becomes universal. How do I know the world is thus? By this.*

**Commentary by Hé Shàng Gōng:** *The **Laozi** says: "How do I know the world?" Those who cultivate the Dao/Way thrive, while those who abandon it perish. By these five stages, one observes and knows it.*

**Commentary by Wáng Bì:** *This is what was spoken of above. It says: "How do I know the world?" Observe oneself to know it, seeking no knowledge from outside. This is the saying: "Without leaving one’s door, one knows the world."*

**Commentary by Wáng Yuàn Zé:** *The sage-rulers uphold one Dao/Way, with no other divergent teachings. Thus, their method of being and their method of knowing are all derived from this Dao/Way. This chapter begins by speaking of those who establish virtue/power, embrace it, and thereby know the world—these are the fundamental principles of the world itself. Those who establish virtue/power and embrace it are the cultivation of oneself. Extending this to the world, one can say it is the foundation of governance and knowledge.*

**Chapter on the Depth of Embracing Virtue/Power** (含德之厚章第五十五):

**The depth of embracing virtue/power** (含德之厚)
**is like that of an infant.**
**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *Only the common people are born with thick virtue/power; as they grow, their nature changes. But those who deeply embrace virtue/power do not change with circumstances, thus their **qi** is concentrated and their will is unified.*
**Commentary by Mèngzǐ:** *The noble person does not lose their infantile heart.*
**Commentary by Tang Emperor Xuanzong:** *The perfected sage (至人) who deeply embraces the richness of virtue/power and the Dao/Way, their conduct is like that of an infant.*

**Chapter on the Depth of Embracing Virtue/Power** (含德之厚章第五十五)

Lǚ Jífǔ said:
*"When a person is first born, their virtue and nature are most profound and rich.*
*As they grow older, their ears and eyes engage with the external world,*
*and their mind and awareness receive impressions from within.*
*With the passage of days, their richness diminishes.*
*Those who cultivate the Dao/Way reduce what they have gained through growth,*
*refining their nature and returning to their original virtue.*
*Thus, it is said:*
*'The depth of embracing virtue/power is like that of an infant.'*
*含 (contain) is the same as 抱 (embrace).*
*The infant’s nature is pure yet undispersed,*
*their qi is harmonious and not violent.*
*Those who deeply embrace virtue/power*
*possess a nature inherently profound and rich,*
*unshaken by external influences,*
*thus likened to an infant.*
*But embracing virtue/power to its fullest*
*is not merely to have the appearance of an infant—*
*it is to possess the infant’s heart.*
*Venomous creatures do not sting them,*
*ferocious beasts do not attack them,*
*and raptors do not seize them.*

Zhāng Jūnxiàng said:
*"Venomous creatures—such as bees, wasps, and snakes—*
*strike by means of their qi.*
*Ferocious beasts—like tigers and rhinoceroses—*
*trample with their feet.*
*Raptors—such as hawks and eagles—*
*injure with their claws.*
*The infant has no intention of harm,*
*thus they are not harmed by such creatures.*
*Moreover,*
*venomous creatures symbolize anger,*
*ferocious beasts symbolize delusion,*
*and raptors symbolize greed.*
*The infant transcends these three evils,*
*thus they are not injured by the Three Poisons.*
*Those who deeply embrace virtue/power*
*practice enduring compassion and patience,*
*generating no anger within,*
*so it is said that venomous creatures do not sting them.*
*Having relinquished all attachment,*
*they have no greed or desire,*
*thus likened to raptors that do not seize.*
*They possess constant clarity and wisdom,*
*forever free from delusion,*
*so it is said that ferocious beasts do not attack them.*
*The infant, being in perfect harmony with the received qi,*
*has no intention of harm,*
*thus nothing can injure them.*
*How much more so for those whose qi is fully guarded and harmonized!*
*What creature, shaped by external forces yet in perfect accord with all things,*
*could possibly harm them?*
*Zhuāngzǐ said:*
*'When a person can empty themselves and wander through the world,*
*who could harm them?'*
*Their bones are weak, their sinews soft, yet their grip is firm.*
*Héshàng Gōng said:*
*'The infant’s sinews and bones are weak yet their grip is firm,*
*because their intention is concentrated and their mind unshaken.'*
*The infant’s intention is concentrated, their will unified,*
*their mind knows nothing, their hands do nothing—*
*thus their fists naturally clench with unyielding strength.*
*They do not yet know the union of male and female*
*yet their movements are spontaneous and pure,*
*their essence at its peak.*

The Imperial Edict commentary said:
*"Those whose virtue is complete possess a form that is complete,*
*thus their bones are weak and their sinews soft yet their grip is firm.*
*Those whose form is complete have a spirit that is complete,*
*thus they do not yet know the union of male and female*
*yet their movements are spontaneous and pure.*
*When their essence is at its peak,*
*they can enter the spirit and restore their vital command (神命)."*

Zhuāngzǐ said:
*"The sage values essence (精)."*

Lín Língsù said:
*"作 (movement) refers to the infant’s yin (obscure, receptive force).*
*牝牡之合 (union of male and female) is the interplay of yin and yang.*
*The infant, not yet knowing the principles of union,*
*yet moving spontaneously,*
*possesses essence that does not disperse.*
*Those who deeply embrace virtue/power,*
*though enlightened to all dharmas,*
*remain in a state of emptiness and stillness,*
*yet do not abandon movement.*
*They respond to things without attachment,*
*their actions in accord with virtue and the times—*
*this is the manifestation of tranquil bodily conduct."*

Wáng Yuànzé said:
*"If their movement arises from external craving,*
*then it is the infant’s essence being squandered,*
*and death follows.*
*How could such a state endure?*
*This is the greatest affliction of the world,*
*yet also the most critical warning for those who seek the Dao/Way."*

*The infant cries all day without ceasing,*
*yet their voice does not grow hoarse—*
*this is the harmony of essence at its utmost.*

The Imperial Edict commentary said:
*"To achieve unity is to attain essence (精).*
*Essence ensures virtue is complete and the spirit undiminished.*
*Harmony arises from the received qi (冲气).*
*Harmony ensures the qi is complete and the throat does not grow hoarse.*
*When a person is born,*
*their essence is received from the One (天一) as the source of wisdom,*
*and their harmony is obtained from the Five (天五) as the foundation of trust.*
*When this harmony reaches its peak,*
*they can enter the spirit and restore their vital command (神命).*
*But those who lose the infant’s heart*
*let their essence waver without restraint,*
*their qi erupt violently and impurely,*
*driving their form and nature to exhaustion,*
*and sinking them into the myriad things—*
*is this not tragic?"*

*When crying reaches its limit yet produces no sound, it is called 嗄 (hoarse).*
*The infant, from morning to evening,*
*cries without variation in tone,*
*because their mind is unmoved and their qi harmonious.*
*If the infant’s mind were troubled by worry or resentment,*
*their qi would clash and become unharmonious—*
*could it remain thus?*
*Those who deeply embrace virtue/power*
*utter profound speech without exhaustion,*
*and expound the law without depletion—*
*this too is the result of embracing the harmonious and received qi.*

*"To know harmony is to know constancy (常)."*
Shū Wáng said:
*"Harmony, in its application, is constant and unchanging,*
*thus it is said:*
*'To know harmony is to know constancy (常).'*
*When a person knows that their qi is harmonious yet weak,*
*they hold command over their life,*
*possessing constancy that does not vary.*
*Thus, at the peak of cultivating the Dao/Way,*
*they attain the restoration of vital command (复命).*
*To restore vital command is to know constancy (常).*
*Embracing virtue/power to its depth*
*leads one to know harmony,*
*and to know harmony is to know constancy (常).*
*Though virtue/power and the Dao/Way may seem separate,*
*when they converge in constancy (常),*
*they become One.*
*To know constancy is to be enlightened (明)."*

Sōng Língxiān said:
*"Harmony is the undivided middle.*
*The Dao/Way is One, without relative form,*
*unchanged by birth and death,*
*thus it is named constancy (常).*
*To know this constancy*
*brings daily enlightenment."*

Shū Wáng said:
*"Without enlightenment, one cannot know constancy (常)."*

*"To increase what is already born is called 祥 (auspicious)."*
Shū Wáng said:
*"Birth cannot be increased,*
*yet people always seek to augment what is born—*
*this brings disaster and inauspiciousness (凶祥)."*

Sūn Dēng said:
*"The richness of perpetual birth*
*is a perversion that brings auspicious yet ominous transformations.*
*Once their form is received,*
*their innate divisions are fixed,*
*their vital processes fully sufficient—*
*no lack, no excess.*
*If nourished directly,*
*they will reach their peak.*
*But if one forcibly increases it,*
*it becomes only an encumbrance,*
*not merely useless but harmful—*
*this is called disaster and inauspiciousness (凶祥)."*

*"The mind directing the qi is called 强 (forced)."*
The Imperial Edict commentary said:
*"When the body aligns with the mind,*
*and the mind aligns with the qi,*
*then the qi is harmonious and not violent.*
*Those who rush or stumble—*
*this is the qi.*
*If the mind truly directs it,*
*then it is forced (强).*
*To contend with things thus*
*is not the Dao/Way of self-mastery."*

Shū Wáng said:
*"The qi should be concentrated to achieve softness (柔).*
*Now it is instead directed by the mind,*
*unable to remain inwardly guarded,*
*thus it becomes violent."*

Thus it is said:
*"When the mind directs the qi, it is called 强 (forced)."*
*The Classic of Documents says:*
*"Do good deeds, and auspiciousness will descend upon you a hundredfold."*
*The previous chapter says:*
*"Guarding softness is called 强 (forced)."*
*Here, auspiciousness is not the auspiciousness of doing good deeds—*
*it is the inauspiciousness of calamitous omens.*
*Here, 强 (forced) is not the 强 (forced) of guarding softness—*
*it is the 强 (forced) of tyranny and aggression.*

*Wang Yuanze said:*
*"If the mind directs the qi, then the qi in turn directs the mind.*
*When mind and qi vie for control,*
*the harmony of Heaven is destroyed,*
*and the True Essence is diminished.*
*What a person receives cannot be artificially increased or diminished.*
*Thus, both forcing growth and depleting the qi*
*are violations of natural order.*
*Mencius warned against pulling up seedlings to hasten their growth,*
*and Laozi spoke against artificially augmenting life.*
*All that is required is to preserve one’s pure qi.*
*This 强 (forced) is not the 强 (forced) of self-mastery—*
*it is the 强 (forced) of tyranny and aggression.*

*Alas!*
*Those of vulgar pursuits, unable to emulate the innocence of an infant,*
*indulge in boundless desires,*
*exhausting the True Essence’s vitality.*
*Some take medicines, others employ petty techniques,*
*seeking to augment the True Essence,*
*yet only invite sickness.*
*Thus Laozi warned against artificially augmenting life.*

*Unable to emulate the infant’s harmonious qi,*
*some use intent to cultivate visualization,*
*others strain the mind to move the qi,*
*desiring the qi to flourish and the body to be full,*
*yet only exhausting the spirit and depleting the qi.*
*Thus Laozi spoke against forcing the qi.*

*When things grow robust, they age—*
*this is called *not-Dao/Way*,*
*and *not-Dao/Way* brings early decay.*
*Su Ziyou said:*
*"To artificially augment life and force the qi,*
*not allowing it to follow its natural course,*
*is to daily incline toward rigidity,*
*and thus aging follows.*
*This is not the nature of the infant.*

*Things cannot be made robust—*
*robustness brings aging.*
*The Dao/Way precedes Heaven and Earth yet does not grow robust,*
*endures beyond ancient times yet does not age.*
*If one does not grasp the True Constant of the Dao/Way,*
*and instead artificially augments life and forces the qi,*
*becoming a tyrant of aggression,*
*one is merely a thing—*
*how can this be the Dao/Way?*
*Thus it is said: early decay.*

*This chapter speaks of the infant’s lack of contrivance,*
*and those who embody profound virtue resemble this.*
*The infant harms nothing with its mind,*
*yet nothing harms it in return.*
*Thus its essence remains whole and undispersed,*
*its qi harmonious and unviolent.*
*To know this is to grasp the True Constant.*
*If one does not know this,*
*then artificially augmenting life and forcing the qi*
*brings the distinctions of robustness and decay,*
*losing the infant’s mind.*
*This is not one who embodies profound virtue.*

*The Wise Do Not Speak* (知者不言)

*The Master of the Yellow River said:*
*"The wise value action, not speech."*

*Cheng Xuanying said:*
*"Those who know the Dao penetrate its subtle principles.*
*Principles transcend speech,*
*thus they do not speak."*

*Gu Huan said:*
*"When the Dao is manifest, speech is forgotten.*
*When speech is preserved, the Dao is lost.*
*The Dao can be silently understood,*
*not articulated by the mouth.*
*Thus Zhuangzi said: ‘The Dao has no questions, questions have no answers.’*
*Those who speak do not know."*

*The Compilation of Subtleties said:*
*"The wise act with the mind, not with rhetoric.*
*They value action, not speech.*
*Those who discuss the Dao rely on rhetoric, not the mind,*
*losing the Dao yet preserving their words.*
*The Dao cannot be spoken,*
*and if spoken, it is false.*
*The wise do not speak,*
*thus the Sage Confucius desired silence,*
*and Mencius was not fond of debate.*

*There are those who awaken beings through proper bearing,*
*those who perceive the Dao through direct observation.*
*Four questions, four unknowns,*
*three questions, three unanswered—*
*these are all instances where the Dao cannot be spoken.*

*Moreover, those who recognize sounds cannot transmit them with the mouth,*
*and the wheelwright cannot speak of his craft.*
*Even those who excel in technique cannot articulate it—*
*how much more so the profound and subtle Dao?*
*Much speech leads to exhaustion,*
*and distance from the Dao.*

*Close the mouth’s aperture,*
*shut the door to speech.*

*The Imperial Edict commentary said:*
*"Retreat and conceal within the profound.*
*Withdraw to store oneself in secrecy."*

*The Compilation of Subtleties said:*
*"This passage shares the same text as Chapter Fifty-Two,*
*yet its meaning differs.*
*There, it emphasizes the Dao’s purity and stillness,*
*to block the roots of desires and joys.*
*Here, it upholds the Dao’s wordlessness,*
*thus invoking the saying of diminishing hearing and discarding sight.*

*The Dao is formless,*
*thus it cannot be seen with the eyes,*
*nor transmitted by the mouth.*
*The Perfect One closes the mouth’s aperture and shuts the door,*
*yet excels in gathering the eyes and contracting the ears,*
*clamping the mouth and sealing the tongue.*
*Thus it is said:*
*"Close the mouth’s aperture,*
*shut the door to speech."*

*Lu Tian said:*
*"The mouth’s aperture is what speaks to things.*
*The door is what communicates with things.*
*To close what delights,*
*to shut what connects—*
*only then can one blunt its sharpness.*

*To blunt its sharpness,*
*to resolve its confusion,*
*to harmonize its brilliance,*
*to blend with the dust—*

*Pei Chu’en said:*
*"To harmonize its brilliance is to make light not dazzle.*
*To blend with the dust is to make dust not stain.*
*To blunt sharpness so nothing escapes within,*
*to resolve confusion so nothing enters from without,*
*to harmonize light so it does not dazzle,*
*to blend with dust so it does not stain—*
*this is how the truly knowing conduct themselves.*
*This is called *playful unity* (玄同)."*

*Su Ziyou said:*
*"The Dao is not in speech,*
*yet it is not separate from speech.*
*But those who know may not speak,*
*and those who speak may not know.*
*Only by closing the mouth’s aperture and shutting the door,*
*blocking the external,*
*blunting sharpness, resolving confusion,*
*harmonizing brilliance, blending with dust,*
*to govern the internal—*
*remaining silent yet not speaking,*
*thus aligning with the Dao—*
*this is *playful ascent* (玄升),*
*entering the Dao.*
*When reaching the playful,*
*the small and the great distinguish themselves,*
*yet only by closing the mouth’s aperture and shutting the door,*
*blunting sharpness, resolving confusion,*
*harmonizing brilliance, blending with dust,*
*remaining silent yet not speaking,*
*can one align with the Dao.*

*Thus it cannot be approached with familiarity,*
*nor rejected with distance,*
*nor exploited for gain,*
*nor harmed by loss,*
*nor elevated in status,*
*nor degraded in rank—*
*thus it is the most noble under Heaven."*

*The Imperial Edict commentary said:*
*"The world’s people attack each other with love and hate,*
*creating distinctions of closeness and distance.*
*Emotions and pretense influence each other,*
*giving rise to perceptions of benefit and harm.*
*Choices and abandonments are weighed,*
*creating divisions of nobility and lowliness.*
*Alternating shifts without end—*
*how can this be the most noble under Heaven?*

*The wise forget speech,*
*and in forgetting speech,*
*they erase love and hate,*
*dissolve emotions and pretense,*
*transcend choices and abandonments,*
*and achieve *playful unity* within the single nature.*
*Thus their nobility is complete,*
*and the world forgets them in turn—*
*hence, they are the most noble under Heaven."*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said:

If this is so, then all things are stored within a single treasury,
and life and death share the same form.
There is nothing to be particularly close to,
nor anything to be particularly distant from—
thus, one cannot be drawn to closeness,
nor pushed toward distance.

One does not pursue gain,
nor shun harm—
thus, one cannot be said to benefit,
nor be said to suffer harm.

One does not glory in prominence,
nor wallow in obscurity—
thus, one cannot be exalted,
nor debased.

Those who can be drawn to closeness or distance,
benefit or harm,
nobility or lowliness—
their worth lies in things,
and all things hold them in contempt.

Those who cannot be drawn to closeness or distance,
benefit or harm,
nobility or lowliness—
their worth lies within themselves,
and no thing can debase them.
How could they not be the most noble under Heaven?

Those who cannot be drawn to closeness or distance—
like Liè Yùzōu dwelling in the gardens of Zhèng,
where no one recognizes him—
is the case.

Those who cannot be said to benefit or harm—
like Liè Zǐ declining Zhèng Zǐyáng’s grain—
is the case.

Those who cannot be said to be noble or lowly—
like Zēng Zǐ dwelling in Wèi—
is the case.

This chapter extols forgetting speech to embody the Dao;
the following passages all demonstrate the Way of silent completion.
Who, then, can be drawn to closeness or distance,
benefit or harm,
nobility or lowliness?

True nobility resides within oneself—
no thing can debase it,
thus they are the most noble under Heaven.

*—From the chapter "Govern with Dao to Rule the State" (Chapter Fifty-Seven)*

The embodiment of the Dao in its constancy is called *zhèng* (正).
*Zhèng* rests in oneness without change—this is the constancy of the Dao.
The Way of governing the state holds constancy as its highest virtue.
Mencius said: *"Rectify the ruler, and the state will be settled."*

In warfare, *"qí"* (奇) is employed—
Gu Huān remarked: *"Qí* is the art of deception and adaptation."
Facing peril, one must master change—warfare knows no surfeit of deceit.
The *Sānlüè Jiǔqí* (三略九奇) and *Jiǔgōng Bǎishèng* (九攻百胜)
are the achievements of the supreme general:
calming strife, ending rebellion, and securing martial virtue.

Liu Zhòngpíng said:
*"What is impure and mixed is the common heart of the world.
What flows without restraint is the common emotion of the world.
But the Way of *zhèng* differs entirely from this.
Thus, to be one without mixture—this is the essence of *zhèng*.
To be still without yielding—this is the application of *zhèng*.
To be one without mixture is to command what is impure.
To be still without yielding is to govern what flows unrestrained.
Therefore, the ruler of a state must not seek it elsewhere—
only by upholding *zhèng* can governance be secured.

But in warfare, it is otherwise.
Wielding deadly weapons, confronting peril, commanding ten thousand,
victory or defeat may hinge on a single moment.
If one can subdue the enemy, then seizing opportunity and adapting to change—
there is nothing that cannot be achieved.
Thus, its manner differs from governing the state,
and so *qí* is employed rather than *zhèng*.

To take the world with *wúshì* (無事).

*—Commentary:* *Zhèng* is the constancy of the Dao,
*qí* is its variation,
*wúshì* is its true essence.
A state is governed by *zhèng*,
warfare is won by *qí*,
and the true Dao admits no private favor.
When one follows nature effortlessly, the world is at peace.

*The Miscellaneous Sayings* state:
*"Zhèng* suffices to govern a single state,
*qí* suffices to wield the five armies.
Only *wúshì* can take the world.
Thus it is said: 'To take the world, one must first be *wúshì*.
When conflict arises, it is no longer sufficient to take the world.'

Yet, did not Táng and Wǔ launch their campaigns without *wúshì*?"
It is replied:
*"Táng and Wǔ aligned with Heaven and responded to humanity.
Their conquests were as effortless as dismissing a single man—
there was no 'conflict' in the true sense.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this."*

Emperor Tang Minghuang said: *"By this, the following text is understood.*

When the world abounds in taboos and prohibitions, the people grow ever poorer.
*Zhuǎn Wēi* explains: *"Taboos"* refers to decrees and edicts.

A ruler cannot refrain from governance, yet uses laws and teachings to rule the state. When prohibitions and nets of law are dense, the people fear transgression, unable to move hand or foot. They have no time but to avoid taboos, daring not to act—every movement disrupts their livelihood, and poverty follows daily.
*Wang Yuanzé* says: *"When actions are forbidden, the people are unsettled and lose their means of subsistence—thus, they become poor."* This is where disorder begins.

When the people possess many sharp tools, the state grows ever more corrupt.
*Wang Bi* says: *"Sharp tools are instruments for self-advantage."* When the people grow strong, the state weakens.
*Wang Yuanzé* says: *"Where sharp tools exist, there must be scheming intentions. When scheming arises, the lower ranks become untrustworthy, and thus the state grows corrupt."*

When the people excel in craft and artifice, strange things proliferate.
*The Imperial Commentary* states: *"When skill and artifice prevail, people turn to frivolous pursuits, and bizarre garments and strange tools emerge to disrupt customs."*
*Wang Bi* says: *"When the people are too clever, deceit and artifice arise. Where deceit and artifice arise, wicked deeds follow."*
*Zhuǎn Wēi* explains: *"Craft and artifice"* refer to skilled and ingenious workmanship.

When laws and edicts grow ever more pronounced, thieves and bandits multiply.
Emperor Tang Minghuang says: *"When *wúwéi* is abandoned, laws grow ever clearer. Those who exploit the law for deceit become thieves—how could they not multiply?"*
Prince Shū says: *"Laws are meant to prohibit wrongdoing in the world. Yet because they prohibit wrongdoing, they give rise to deceit. For where laws are made, deceit follows; where edicts are issued, trickery arises. Thus it is said: When laws and edicts grow ever more pronounced, thieves and bandits multiply."*

Therefore, the Sage says:
*River Above Master* [i.e., Laozi] says: *"This refers to the following text."*

The Sage says:

*"I practice wúwéi, and the people transform of themselves.*
**Commentary:** *Heaven acts with wúwéi and thus remains clear; Earth acts with wúwéi and thus remains tranquil. When these two wúwéi harmonize, all things transform. The Sage embodies Heaven and Earth, so the people daily advance in virtue without knowing who guides them.*

*Emperor Yao and Shun sat in silent repose within the Hall of Law, hands folded in repose, observing the flourishing of the people. The Duke of Zhou and Wu Wang governed without knowing or acting, yet all followed in harmony. The Emperor ruled with sleeves draped and hands folded, and the realm was governed—this is the Way of the Sage: wúwéi, yet the people transform.*

*Zhuangzi says: ‘With wúwéi, all things transform.’*

*I do nothing, and the people grow wealthy.*
**River Above Master says:** *I impose no corvée labor or conscription, so the people secure in their occupations, and all grow wealthy.*
**The *Lèi Jié* says:** *When the heart practices wúwéi and actions do nothing, the four classes take joy in their work, and the people prosper abundantly. This reverses the world’s excess of prohibitions, which only makes the people poorer.*

*When the ruler does nothing, forced labor does not arise, and the people’s agricultural seasons are not disrupted—thus they grow wealthy. This further explains the meaning of ‘the people grow poorer’ from above.*

*I love stillness, and the people become upright.*
**Wang Yuanzé says:** *To love stillness is to return to one’s nature. When the ruler returns to nature, the people also return to nature, and thus become upright.*
**This further explains the meaning of ‘thieves and bandits multiply’ from above.*
**Yang Fu says:** *When I act, the people become perverse; when I am still, the people become upright. This reverses the harm of excessive sharp tools, which bring confusion to the state.*

*I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.*
**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *With wúwéi, there is clarity and stillness, so the people transform. With no affairs, there is no disturbance, so the people grow wealthy. With love of stillness, one attains nature, so the people become upright. With no desires, harmony is preserved, so the people return to simplicity. This is the Way of taking the world without action.*

*Simplicity is the preservation of nature. When my nature is whole and I have no desires, the people also have no desires and return to simplicity.*
**This further explains the meaning of ‘strange things’ from above.*
**This chapter advocates taking the world without action.*

*From ‘the world abounds in prohibitions’ to ‘thieves and bandits multiply’—this is the error of taking the world with action. From ‘I practice wúwéi and the people transform’ to ‘I have no desires and the people return to simplicity’—this is the proof of taking the world without action.*

**Chapter 58: The Governance of Murky Tranquility**

*When governance is murky and tranquil, the people are pure and thick.*
**River Above Master says:** *When governance is broad and tranquil, as if unclear, the people become pure and abundant, living in mutual harmony.*
**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *When governance is murky and tranquil, without action or strictness, the people respond with purity and simplicity.*
**Lǚ Jìfǔ says:** *‘Pure and thick’ means they are not thin or sparse.*

*When governance is sharp and scrutinizing, the people become depleted and exhausted.*
**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *When governance is sharp and scrutinizing, with action and urgency, the people respond with depletion and decay.*
**Prince Shū says:** *‘Murky and tranquil’ means no distinctions are made. Only when no distinctions are made can the people remain without knowledge or desire, and thus they are pure and thick. ‘Sharp and scrutinizing’ means distinctions are made. When distinctions are made, the people cannot remain without knowledge or desire, and thus they become depleted and exhausted.*
**Lǚ Jìfǔ says:** *‘Depleted and exhausted’ means they are not fully simple.*

*Disaster, yet fortune depends upon it,*
**River Above Master says:** *‘Depends upon’ means ‘arises from.’ Disaster arises from fortune. When one encounters disaster and reflects, blaming oneself and cultivating virtue, disaster departs and fortune arrives.*

*Fortune, yet disaster lurks within it.*
**River Above Master says:** *Disaster lurks hidden within fortune. When one obtains fortune and becomes arrogant, fortune departs and disaster arrives.*
**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *‘Depends upon’ means ‘arises from.’ ‘Lurks within’ means ‘is hidden in.’ Above, it is said that when governance is murky and tranquil, the people mistakenly believe there is no governance, yet they become pure and simple. This is disaster arising from fortune. When governance is sharp and scrutinizing, the people believe there is governance, yet they become depleted and exhausted—this is fortune hiding disaster.*

*Where disaster and fortune depend upon and lurk within the realm of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, where shall one reside?*
*Indeed, when disaster comes and one is not afraid, reflecting and blaming oneself to avoid disaster—this is to dwell between disaster and fortune. If so, disaster will not come, nor will fortune arrive. Disaster and fortune will be nonexistent, and who would suffer calamity?*
*Zhuangzi says: ‘At peace with disaster and fortune.’*

*Who knows their limit?*
**River Above Master says:** *Disaster and fortune generate each other; who can know their end?*
**Sun Deng says:** *‘Who’ means ‘who.’ ‘Limit’ means ‘exhaustion.’ One person’s disaster and fortune interdepend, alternating without fixed pattern—disaster arises from fortune, fortune comes through disaster—who can know their exhaustion?*

*There is no fixed right or wrong.*
**Wang Yuanzé says:** *The great course does not linger in any age—this is to wish to establish the right, yet not knowing that the right cannot be constant. Then can this be called wisdom?*
*Although it is said there is no fixed right, this is to take ‘no fixed right’ as the right. ‘Wrong’ is a doubtful phrase, yet it is also not fixed in ‘no fixed right.’*
*The right becomes strange, the good becomes ominous, and the people’s confusion has long endured.*
**Commentary:** *All under Heaven is but one breath. What was right yesterday may be wrong today; what was contrary before may align later. Divine and strange, fragrant and putrid—these transform into each other, beginning and ending. Thus, the strange and the right generate each other, the ominous and the good alternate. This is the natural unfolding of one breath.*

*The world has existed for long—small errors change methods, great errors change nature. The customs of selfishness prevail and are not illuminated. Where disaster and fortune depend upon and lurk, and governance is sharp and scrutinizing, how can the people return to their true nature?*
**Lǚ Dì says:** *‘There is no fixed right or wrong’—this means there is right when there is right, and right is what is called right. Right is without fixed right. Only when there is no fixed right can one transcend the realm of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, having neither disaster nor fortune, and know their limit.*

「If one cannot attain the state of *Wu Zheng* [無正, "without fixed right"], but instead wanders into the realm of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, then disaster and fortune will follow in turn—like the revolving of a wheel, like the cycling of seasons—ultimately leading only to confusion.

Hence it is said: *Wu Zheng* becomes *Qi* [奇, "strange"], *Shan* [善, "good"] turns into *Yao* [妖, "ominous"]. The people’s confusion is indeed long-standing.

Thus, the Sage is square yet does not cut [方而不割],*
**御注:** *Square* refers to being steadfast in the Dao/Way while not rigidly fixed, flowing without obstruction, yet leaving no trace of discrimination.*

**Gu Xuan** says: *Square one’s conduct, and the strange and ominous will keep their distance; one does not sever with one’s steadfastness, yet they follow along.*

Frugal yet not stingy [廉而不刿],*
**御注:** *Frugal* means maintaining purity in oneself.*
**Wang Bi** says: *Frugal* is the same as *clean and at ease*. *Sath* [刿, "stingy"] is to harm. To guide the people with purity and ease, ordering them to abandon their evil, ordering them to cast off their impurities—this is not to harm them with purity and ease.*

Straightforward yet not domineering [直而不肆],*
**He Shang Gong** says: *Dominering* means to press one’s views upon others.*
The Sage, though straight, bends to follow others; never does he press his own views.*
**Wang Bi** says: *To guide with straightforwardness, ordering them to abandon their perversity, yet not to press one’s own straightforwardness upon them, provoking resistance—this is what is meant by "great straightness is like bending."*
**Wang Yuanze** says: *Straightforwardness that is domineering will have its own straightness. Great straightness aligns with principle, remaining constant; bending to follow principle. The *Book of Documents* says: "Straightforward yet gentle, gentle so as not to harm within."* Straightforward yet harsh externally, not harsh so as to domineer over others—this is what is meant by *not domineering*.
The *Analects* says: *"Of substance yet loving righteousness, bright yet not dazzling."*
**御注:** *Straightforwardness that is domineering will domineer over others, and the faults of such behavior will manifest; brightness that dazzles will invite the calamity of flaunting one’s deeds.*

To be straight within yet yielding without, to use one’s brightness yet return to one’s clarity—this is only the Sage.

When the people are confused, those who take *Wu Zheng* [方, "square"] as correct are like the *Zi Mo* [子莫] who clutches the disorder in his mouth. Those who take *Kang* [康, "at ease"] as correct are like the *Zhong Zi* [仲子] who holds his breath. Knowing how to stretch yet not knowing how to bend, knowing how to display yet not knowing how to conceal—with such boastful, worldly customs, they lose the Sage’s complete harmony. How can they rectify the world?

The Sage rectifies the world—how? Thus and no other way.

**Wang Yuanze** says: *Brightness that dazzles others is called "dazzling."* To harmonize one’s brightness and return to one’s clarity—how can this be dazzling? This passage speaks of disaster and fortune, *Wu Zheng* and *Qi*, *Shan* and *Yao* generating each other, yet the people cannot know their confusion. Indeed, it has been long-standing—how then can they be further misled by sharp and scrutinizing governance? How can the people preserve their original purity?

Thus, though the Sage is square, at ease, straightforward, and bright in his own conduct, he never displays his traces to show others. He takes this *mèn mèn* [闷闷, "mysterious and unassuming"], abandoning that *chácháchá* [察察, "sharp and scrutinizing"], and thus remains tranquil amid disaster and fortune.

**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven [治人事天]**

Governing people and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses frugality [啬].
**御注:** *Frugality* is the preservation of one’s spirit and essence without external depletion or internal waste.*

The spirit and essence flow boundlessly in all directions, reaching their utmost without limit—above, they touch Heaven; below, they coil within Earth. Transforming and nurturing all things, their name is *Tong Di* [同帝, "in harmony with the Emperor"]. This is how Heaven becomes Heaven and humanity becomes humanity—only through *Yin* [音, "resonance/harmony"].

To cherish and nourish the spirit and essence, then to govern people below and serve Heaven above—hence it is said: *Governing people and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses frugality.*

Only frugality is called *early return* [早复].
**Lü Jifu** says: *Only frugality preserves the spirit and essence without expending them, thus it is "early return."* If one is not frugal and instead squanders, until the spirit is exhausted and the essence worn out, even if one wished to return to one’s original nature, there would be no way to enter it. Is this not too late?

Hence it is said: *Only frugality is called early return.*
**Wang Yuanze** says: *When movement reaches its limit and stillness begins, then the return is late. Only frugality does not indulge in waste, for its departure from the root is never distant—thus, the return is early.*

*Early return* is called *heavily accumulating virtue* [重积德].
**Lü Jifu** says: *Humanity’s life is inherently sufficient through virtue. If one truly harmonizes and returns early, virtue will daily increase and fill.*

Hence it is said: *Early return is called heavily accumulating virtue.*
**御注:** *To overcome is called "conquer."*

Heavily accumulating virtue, one conquers all—
**Lü Jifu** says: *Heavily accumulating virtue means virtue reaches its utmost. The utmost virtue cannot be scorched by fire, drowned by water, harmed by cold or heat, or preyed upon by beasts. How can it not conquer all?*

Hence it is said: *Heavily accumulating virtue, one conquers all.*
**御注:** *When virtue reaches its utmost, it is boundless in response—who can know its limit?*

Heavily accumulating virtue, one conquers all—
**Lü Jifu** says: *If there is something one cannot conquer, then the Dao/Way has its limits. If one conquers all, who can know its limit?*

Hence it is said: *Heavily accumulating virtue, one conquers all—then none can know its limit.*

None can know its limit—thus one can have a state [國].
**御注:** *When one’s body is boundless, there is ample room to govern the world—how much more so to have a state?*

**Lü Jifu** says: *One who holds land possesses a great thing. One who possesses a great thing cannot be constrained by things. To constrain yet not be constrained—thus one can constrain all things. None can know its limit, so one is not constrained yet can constrain all things. Even if one holds land, there will be no burden.*

Hence it is said: *None can know its limit—thus one can have a state.*
The mother of a lasting state—
**御注:** *The Dao/Way is the mother of all things.*

Those who follow the **Dao/Way** are unblemished through ten thousand generations. **Shu Wang** said: *"States all arise from the **Dao/Way**, thus the **Dao/Way** is called the mother. If one abides by it, one’s life will not perish."*

Hence it is said: *"Thus one can endure forever."*

This is called **deep-rooted and firmly anchored**—**Wang Yuanzhe** said: *"Humans take **nature/xing** as their root; all else beyond this is but branches and leaves. Those who lose their **nature/xing**** overdevelop their branches and leaves to harm their root. When the root is injured, vital **qi** and essence decline, and the anchor is not firm—this is why they perish early."*

Only through **parsimony** can one avoid external harm to the root. When the root is deep, the anchor is firm; when the anchor is firm, one’s form remains bound to life, and separation is delayed.

**Lu Tian** said: *"When nothing can measure it—this is called **deep**. When nothing can topple it—this is called **firm**."*

The **Dao/Way** of long life and enduring vision—
**御注:** The **Dao/Way** is the mother of all things. Things are its offspring. **Nature/xing** is the root of form; form is its trunk. Knowing its offspring and preserving its mother, one’s life will not perish, hence the enduring forever. When the root is deep, the trunk is firm; when **nature/xing** is preserved, the form remains whole. Aligning with Heaven and Earth as constants, one can thus achieve long life. With the sun and moon sharing their luminosity, one can thus endure vision forever. When humans and things transform yet the **Dao/Way** alone remains—this is called the **Dao/Way**."

**Lü Jifu** said: *"To practice **parsimony** as the **Dao/Way**—this is called **deep-rooted and firmly anchored**, the **Dao/Way** of long life and enduring vision. **Spirit/shen** is the root of life; if one hoards and preserves it, the root will be deep and life will endure. **Long life** is the anchor of vision; if one guards and protects it, the anchor will be firm and vision will last long. This chapter begins by saying that in governing people and harmonizing with Heaven, nothing surpasses **parsimony**, and concludes with the **Dao/Way** of long life and enduring vision. Indeed, the **Dao/Way** of enduring forever lies in conserving one’s **spirit/shen**. **Spirit/shen** is the root; form is the anchor. When the root is deep and the anchor is firm, life and vision endure forever."*

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor asked about the **Dao/Way** of enduring forever, and Guangcheng instructed him: *"Embrace the **spirit/shen** and remain still; your form will naturally rectify itself. Do not disturb your vital **qi**—then you may achieve long life."* The *Inner Canon* states of the **True Person/zhenren**: *"Inhaling and exhaling vital **qi**, standing alone to guard the **spirit/shen**, thus one’s lifespan can compare to Heaven and Earth, without end."* Speaking of the **Perfect One/zhi** it says: *"Accumulate **jing/essence** and preserve **shen/spirit**."* Speaking of the **Sage/shengren** it says: *"The **spirit/shen** does not scatter."* Examining from ancient times to the present, no **True Sage/upper sage** has ever achieved perfection without conserving their **spirit/shen**.*

As for the people of today’s age, they exhaust their **jing/essence** with desire and dissipate their **True Self/zhen** through wastefulness. They do not know how to maintain fullness nor to govern the **spirit/shen** at the proper time. They lose their **jing/essence** and **ling/soul**, their form declines, and they perish early—how can this be the **Dao/Way**?"

Hence it is said: *"The **Dao/Way** is what the **Sage/shengren** practices; the foolish turn away from it."* **Daoist Canon/True Classic of Dao and Virtue**—*Collection of the Good, Volume Nine* concludes. *Collection of the Good, Volume Ten* concludes.

**Collection of the Master Li Lin of Song’s Residence in Rao: Chapter Sixty – Governing a Great Realm**

Governing a great realm is like cooking a small fresh fish.
*Commentary:* Stirring a small fresh fish too often causes it to break apart.
To govern a great realm with frequent changes in law brings confusion.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** of governance values tranquility, and the people settle themselves.
Wang Bi says: *"It means not to disturb."*

Agitation brings many harms; stillness preserves the **True Self/zhen**.
Hence, the greater the realm, the more tranquil its ruler must be—only then can he broadly win the hearts of the people.

Liu Zhongping says: *"For the greatest of realms, governance should be as simple as cooking a small fresh fish. Why? Because it avoids unnecessary disturbance.*
A small fish is easily ruined by overhandling.
A weak people are easily troubled by interference.
The cook of a small fresh fish lets it cook itself.
The ruler of a great realm lets the people govern themselves.

The **Classic** says: *"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves; I love stillness, yet the people align themselves."*

To govern the world with the **Dao/Way**, its spirits are not numinous.
Lu Zhan says: *"Ghosts and spirits, when unsettled and restless, manifest as calamities.*
The ancients who governed the world with the **Dao/Way**—even birds, beasts, fish, and turtles, as well as mountains, rivers, and ghosts—all found peace, and thus there were no ominous portents."

Wang Yuanze says: *"When the people are undisturbed, they fulfill their nature.*
When the people fulfill their nature, the harmony of Heaven and Earth responds, and all things flourish without hindrance.
Thus, even ghosts find peace in their place and cannot become numinous."

When humans and ghosts follow different **Dao/Way**s yet often clash, it is because the **qi** of yin and yang is disordered, and their proper balance is lost—thus, spirits exploit the opportunity.

Though the world is vast, true governance lies in the **Dao/Way**, which acts without action and trusts in spontaneity.
To govern a great realm is like cooking a small fresh fish—this is called governing the world with the **Dao/Way**.
Thus, the **qi** of yin and yang remains harmonious, and humans and ghosts each dwell in peace—hence, *"its spirits are not numinous."*

Not that its spirits are without numen—rather, they do not harm the people.
Emperor Xuanzong of Tang says: *"The saying ‘its spirits are not numinous’ does not mean ghosts vanish or lose their numen; it means their numen does not manifest as malevolence to harm people."*

Not that their numen does not harm the people—rather, the Sage does not harm the people.
Liu Jinxi says: *"Numen is the manifestation of spiritual efficacy.*
These ghosts lack such efficacy, but when a ruler governs with the **Dao/Way**, the spirits bless the people and cannot harm them.
To govern a great realm is like cooking a small fresh fish—this is called the Sage not harming the people.

Only the Sage does not harm the people, so Heaven and Earth’s harmony responds, and humans and ghosts each fulfill their nature without mutual harm.
When neither harms the other, **virtue/power** naturally returns.

*Commentary:* *"To govern the world with the **Dao/Way** is to act without action, letting things follow their nature, avoiding war and capital punishment—this is called not harming the people.*
At such times, spirits and people do not harm each other, and **virtue/power** returns.
The spirits do not manifest their numen—only blessings abound.
Thus it is said: ‘Its numen does not harm the people; the people have no need to exert their cleverness.’
Their daily lives are but eating and drinking—what harm could there be?
This chapter urges rulers to govern the world with the **Dao/Way**, acting without action and trusting in spontaneity, so that the subtle and manifest each dwell in their place, and humans and spirits do not interfere with one another, while **virtue/power** returns.

In the time of Emperor Yao, celestial communications ceased, and no spirits descended.
In the age of the Xia, mountains, rivers, and ghosts all found peace.
This was the **Sage** governing the world without action.

**Chapter Sixty-One – Great Realms Are Like the Lower Reaches**

Great realms are like the lower reaches [of a river].
He Shangong says: *"To govern a great realm, one must be like the river and sea dwelling in the lower reaches, not resisting the smallest currents."*

Wang Bi says: *"The river and sea are vast yet dwell low, so all streams flow to them.
A great realm is vast yet dwells low, so all under Heaven turns to it—thus, great realms are like the lower reaches."*

Lu Jifu says: *"If one knows to govern with the **Dao/Way**, one certainly does not harm the people.
But if one does not know how to win the world, then even if one does not harm the people, others may harm them.
Great realms are like the lower reaches—the gathering place of the world.
The world’s gathering place is receptive, like the female.
The female always overcomes the male through stillness, and stillness is humility—this is the way to win the world and preserve the people.

The world’s gathering place.
Wang Bi says: *"Where all under Heaven converges—an assembly."*

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang says: *"The lower reaches signify the **virtue/power** of humility.
A great realm, by dwelling low and opening itself, invites all under Heaven to gather.

The world’s gathering place is receptive, like the female.
Wang Bi says: *"Still and not seeking, yet all come of their own accord."*

Wang Yuanze says: *"One should receive all with feminine stillness.*
The female always overcomes the male through stillness.
He Shangong says: *"Yin overcomes yang by being tranquil and not seeking first."*

Stillness is humility.
Wang Bi says: *"Because of its stillness, it can be humble.*
The female is the receptive.
The male is restless, consumed by desire; the female is always still, thus overcoming the male.
Because of its stillness, it can also be humble, and thus all things turn to it."*

Duke Shū of Shu says: *"Gathering is the assembly of the people; if one can endure what the people dislike, then all movements of the world will turn to it.
Thus it is said: ‘The world’s gathering place is receptive’—for the world’s gathering is but the gathering of the receptive.
The receptive always overcomes the active through stillness, and stillness is humility—thus, stillness is the ruler, and always dwelling low, it is sufficient to overcome the active.
Thus it is said: ‘With stillness, it overcomes the active; with stillness, it is humble.’

Lu Jifu says: *"The world’s gathering place is receptive, and the receptive always overcomes the active through stillness—yet what allows it to overcome is its humility through stillness.
Thus, great realms, by dwelling low over small realms, take the small realms.
Wang Bi says: *"‘Great realms dwell low’—meaning even great realms dwell low over small realms, and the small realms attach to them."*

Gu Huan said: *"When great realms are humble with emptiness, then small realms rejoice and submit. Their submission is how one takes those small realms. When small realms submit to great realms, they take the great realms."*

Heshang Gong said: *"This means that regardless of a realm’s size, if it practices humility and nurtures others, it will have no faults."*

Wang Bi said: *"The great realm receives them."*

Lu Yu said: *"It takes them because they accommodate it."*

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *"The great takes the small to make them subjects and servants. The small takes the great to seek aid."*

Thus, sometimes one submits to take, and sometimes one submits while taking.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *"‘With’ means the great takes the small, ‘while’ means the small takes the great."*

Lu Jifu said: *"Thus, when great realms submit to small realms, they take the small realms—this is what is meant by ‘sometimes submitting to take.’ Submitting to take means that though the great could dominate the small, it submits to take them. When small realms submit to great realms, they take the great realms—this is what is meant by ‘sometimes submitting while taking.’ Submitting while taking means that though the small cannot avoid submitting to the great, they do so to take them."*

King Xuan of Qi asked: *"Is there a Way to interact with neighboring realms?"*

Mencius replied: *"There is. Only the virtuous can serve the small with the great, hence Tang served Ge and King Wen served Kunyi. Only the wise can serve the great with the small, hence Taiwang served Xiányú and Goujian served Wu. Serving the small with the great is the act of one who rejoices in Heaven’s order. Serving the great with the small is the act of one who fears Heaven’s order. Those who rejoice in Heaven’s order preserve all under Heaven, while those who fear it preserve only their own realm."*

Great realms seek only to encompass and nurture others.

Heshang Gong said: *"If great realms do not lose their humility, they will encompass and nurture small realms."*

Cheng Xuan Ying said: *"The reason great realms practice humility is that they have no ulterior motives—they seek only to love and nurture small realms."*

Small realms seek only to submit and serve others.

Liu Jinxi said: *"When small realms use gentleness, they have no hidden intentions—they seek only to enter the great realm’s embrace, admiring its virtue and serving it."*

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *"When great realms hold to the virtue of humility and submit to small realms, they seek only to encompass and nurture small realms as subjects and servants. When small realms offer tribute and submit to great realms, they seek only to serve the great as allies. Both parties thus obtain what they desire, hence the great should submit."*

Liu Qihui said: *"Those who rely on greatness risk arrogance, so this is a special warning."*

Shu Wang said: *"It is easy for the small to serve the great, but difficult for the great to serve the small. Since this is what is difficult for people, Laozi says the great should submit."*

Lu Jifu said: *"Now, the great submits to the small, and the small submits to the great—each obtains what it desires. Then who would not take? ‘Taking’ means winning their hearts without losing them. Yet if the great should not submit, and only the great is said to submit, why? If the small cannot submit to the great, not only will it fail to take the great realm, but disaster will befall it. Thus, even if it seems unfit, it is said: ‘The great should submit.’ The great, encompassing the four seas and ruling all under Heaven, holds a lofty position and exalted rank. If it falls into excess and fullness, it is especially prone to arrogance. Thus, it must practice humility."*

Liuzi said: *"Heaven’s Way is to descend and illuminate, and seas and rivers rule by descending. Mountains are humble when rooted in the earth, and kings and lords consider solitude and poverty as detriments. This chapter speaks of the Way to interact with neighboring realms, taking humility as its foundation. Thus, regardless of size, all realms should practice humility. The great must especially fear arrogance, hence the special warning."*

**Chapter Sixty-Two: Dao as the Mysterious Origin of All Things**

Dao is the mysterious origin of all things.

Liu Zhongping said: *"Mysterious" refers to the deepest dwelling. "Border" refers to a narrow edge. When speaking of Dao’s subtlety, it is likened to the mysterious. When speaking of Dao’s coarseness, it is likened to the border. Speaking of subtlety reveals the border’s coarseness; speaking of the border reveals subtlety’s mystery.*

The treasure of the virtuous.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *"The virtuous know that those who guard Dao prosper, so they always treasure and value it for use."*

Wang Yuanzhe said: *"The treasure of the virtuous is what the Sage embodies. Under Heaven, nothing is more valued than Dao. Those who know Dao’s value are the virtuous. ‘Treasure’ means precious and honored. Dao as treasure is the essence of vital breath and spirit. Vital essence is the foundation of the body—preserving it without dissipation ensures the body’s completeness. Concentrating qi without recklessness ensures the body’s fullness. Guarding the spirit without scattering ensures the body’s perfection. The three merge as one—this is why Dao is the virtuous’ treasure."*

The non-virtuous’ reliance.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *"‘Reliance’ means ‘to depend upon.’ The non-virtuous cannot treasure Dao, but when facing peril, they seek to preserve themselves by relying on Dao to escape."*

Nothing is not Dao—
the virtuous seek it to attain virtue,
the non-virtuous rely on it to avoid ruin.

Sun Deng said: *"Fine words can elevate one’s reputation above all goods, and conduct can place one above others. Yet Dao, when spoken, is as insipid as water. The Sage acts without doing, teaches without speaking—how could he adorn speech to please the people’s ears or embellish conduct to dazzle all things?"*

Lu Tian said: *"‘Words’ refers to wind and waves; ‘conduct’ refers to ruin."*

Yet even fine words can command esteem, and virtuous conduct can elevate one above others—how much more so is Dao the profound essence of all things! This is why the ancients employed this Dao to awaken the people.

When even one person is enlightened by it, though one were to fill the Dharma-realm with the most precious treasures and distribute them all, no merit could surpass this.

Thus it is said:
*"Fine words can command esteem,
virtuous conduct can elevate one above others.
What reason would the unvirtuous have to abandon it?"*

Therefore, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Exalted Ministers are appointed.

Gu Huan said:
*"To establish the sovereign and set up ministers,
to discuss Dao and govern the state—
this is to lead the world by Dao,
to teach and transform the unvirtuous."*

Du Guangting said:
*"The vastness of the Four Seas,
the wealth of myriad things—
from the first emergence of the people,
there must be no ruler without authority.
Thus the Son of Heaven is established to shepherd them.
The Son of Heaven honors the Supreme Deity,
serves Heaven as a son,
serves Earth as a mother—
this is called the Son of Heaven.
One person cannot govern broadly,
so the chiefs of a hundred officials are appointed,
among whom are the Three Exalted Ministers.
The *Book of Documents* says:
‘These are the Three Exalted Ministers,
discussing Dao and governing the state.’
The Three Exalted Ministers are the Grand Teacher, Grand Tutor, and Grand Guardian.
Wen Gong said:
‘The sovereign is established to oversee and shepherd the people,
ministers are appointed to instruct and safeguard the sovereign.
Even with a jade tablet held before four horses,
it is not as good as advancing this Dao.
The Imperial Commentary says:
*The noble person’s cultivation of self brings peace to the world.*
When the Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers
use jade tablets and four-horse carriages to attract the worthy,
but do not strive to advance Dao and cultivate themselves,
they abandon self-governance for others,
losing the Way of self-regulation.
It is better to simply advance this Dao within oneself.
Where Dao resides, the Sage holds it in highest honor,
so the people follow it as they flock to market.
Shu Wang said:
‘Though one may hold a jade tablet the width of two hands
and lead four horses to welcome the worthy,
it is still not as good as simply advancing this Dao.’
Wang Yuanzhe said:
‘The Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers
take the transformation of the people as their duty.
If they possess Dao, the world will naturally submit.
Jade tablets and four-horse carriages are used to attract the worthy—
this is the greatest of governance.
Even if the worthy are obtained,
if Dao is not advanced, the people will still not submit.
Thus it is better not to seek externally but to grasp the essence of Dao.’

This is the threefold explanation of using jade tablets and four-horse carriages to attract the worthy.

Lü Jifu said:
‘Therefore, the Son of Heaven is established,
and the Three Exalted Ministers are appointed.
Even with a jade tablet held before four horses,
these are the rites of respect and the weight of offerings for the sovereign.
Yet it is still not as good as advancing this Dao while seated,
for Dao is the most honored in the world—
even if advanced while seated,
it surpasses respectful rites and heavy offerings.
The Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers
discuss Dao while seated—
this is all there is to it.’

This explains how jade tablets and four-horse carriages are used to honor the sovereign.

Why did the ancients hold this Dao in such high regard?
Gu Huan said:
‘Why did the ancients value this Dao so highly?
What was their reasoning?
Was it not because seeking brings attainment,
and guilt is thereby absolved?
Thus it is the most honored in the world.’

The Imperial Commentary says:
‘Seeking brings attainment—
this is seeking within oneself.
The ancients sought it in yin-yang and numerology
but did not attain it,
for they sought externally.
The wicked become virtuous,
the foolish become wise—
this is how guilt is absolved.
Such is the power of Dao to save,
and thus it is the most honored in the world.’

The *Transmission* says:
‘There is nothing in the world more honored than Dao.’

Lü Jifu said:
‘Seeking brings attainment—
this is the treasure of the virtuous.
Guilt is absolved—
this is the refuge of the unvirtuous.
Because of this,
Dao is the most honored in the world,
and thus the ancients could not help but honor it.’

This chapter speaks of all things arising from Dao,
and Dao being the most honored in the world.
Those who practice it virtuously are the virtuous.

Thus it is said:
‘Seeking brings attainment,
and those who preserve and entrust it are the common people.
Guilt is absolved—
for Dao is never without use,
and thus it is the most honored in the world.’

---
**Chapter 63: *For Non-Action***

To act without acting,
to manage without managing,
to savor without savoring.

The Imperial Commentary says:
‘The nature of Dao is without doing, hence non-action;
without form, hence no managing;
without desire, hence no savoring.
The Sage responds to things as they are,
while embodying the non-being of Dao—
here, the three are clearly seen.’

Liu Jinxi said:
‘To act without acting—
this is cultivating Dao’s work.
To manage without managing—
this is perceiving Dao’s form.
To savor without savoring—
this is penetrating Dao’s principles.
Non-action is Dao’s constant.
No managing is Dao’s true nature.
No savoring is Dao’s simplicity.
These three are all Dao itself.’

Great or small, many or few—
repaying enmity with virtue.

The Imperial Commentary says:
‘Great and small refer to form,
many and few refer to quantity—
things are boundless, beyond measure.
Great yet not excessive,
small yet not deficient—
then the repayment of enmity and gratitude,
who can distinguish them?
Thus the Sage unifies all things in the One,
and accomplishes the great.’

Wang Yuanzhe said:
‘To repay enmity with enmity is a matter of action.
To repay enmity with virtue is virtue itself.
Action shares in fortune and misfortune with the people,
thus all methods must be employed without omission.
But virtue is unseen—
how could enmity arise?
As for the three matters above,
these are the embodiment of Dao.
When embodying Dao,
it must be thus.
If one speaks of enmity yet repays with virtue,
then one knows virtue pervades all things.’

Cao Daochong said:
‘Repaying enmity with virtue extinguishes enmity.
Repaying enmity with enmity leads to endless retaliation.
Difficulties arise from what is easy,
the great from what is small.’

Zuan Wei said:
‘This is a grave warning.
Difficult and easy, great and small—
these are the uppermost categories of greatness and multitude.
Right and wrong, beauty and ugliness,
enmity and gratitude—
all arise from subtle beginnings,
none without first being easy,
then becoming difficult,
first small,
then great.’

Now if one plans for difficulties when they are still easy,
then at the end, there will be no hardship.
If one acts on small beginnings while they are still small,
then later there will be no greatness.

But if one waits until difficulties have already arisen to address them,
or undertakes great tasks when they are already great,
then resentment and anger will deepen while calamities accumulate—
and when one seeks to resolve difficulties and untangle chaos,
how could it not be difficult?

The seeds of disaster lie hidden in the subtle and minute,
manifesting where ordinary people fail to notice.
By the time they take root,
even the wise cannot remedy the consequences.

Thus, when resentment arises,
one must attend to it while it is still easy and small,
and then there will be no resentment.

The *Classic of Documents* says:
*"Resentment does not lie in what is obvious—
it is unseen when one fails to act early."*

Great undertakings in the world
must begin with what is easy.
Great affairs in the world
must begin with what is small.

**Commentary:**
*A thousand-zhang dike collapses from the burrow of an ant;
a hundred-foot hall burns from a crack’s smoke.*
White Gui sealed the dike’s holes when building it,
so there was no water disaster.
The aged craftsman sealed the gaps when tending the fire,
so there was no fire calamity.

All things under heaven
begin from the most minute origins,
yet by the time they reach their end,
they cannot be easily managed.

Thus, the Sage acts early.

**Commentary by Cui (疏):**
*"Action"* means *"to arise."* This elaborates on how calamities originate.
Difficult matters must arise from what is easy, so one must address them while they are still easy.
Great affairs must arise from what is minute, so one must eliminate them while they are still small.
Their instances are indeed numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed.
Hence, the summary is given as *"all under heaven."*

Du Guangting (杜光庭) said:
*"To prevent disaster before its signs appear,
to cut off calamity before its sprouting—
this is the utmost caution."*

Thus, the Sage never undertakes what is difficult and great,
and therefore is able to achieve what is great.

**Imperial Commentary (御注):**
*"If one acts while things are small,
then one can achieve what is great.*
If disorder has already formed and is then addressed,
is it not too late?"

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (唐明皇) said:
*"The earlier rulers often undertook what was difficult and great,
so they planned and eliminated it.*
This shows that the Sage does not undertake what is difficult and great,
and thus is able to achieve what is great."*

**On light promises:**
Cheng Xuanying (成玄英) said:
*"This is an illustrative analogy.*
*'Promise'* means *'to assent.'*
*'Few'* means *'little.'*
Those who lightly assent to others
will necessarily have little sincerity in their words."*

Du Guangting said:
*"Yang Wu had no second thoughts in his commands,
Zilu had no lingering promises—
the ancients praised them thus."*

*The Records* say:
*"Better to have no promises to break
than to incur personal resentment."*

**On excessive ease:**
Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:
*"Lightly promising others will result in few fulfilled words.
Frequent ease in action will inevitably lead to many difficulties."*

Cheng Xuanying said:
*"This is the resolution of the analogy.*
Those who lightly commit offenses
will necessarily invite grave retribution."*

Luoshi (罗什) said:
*"If one acts lightly without restraint,
the retribution will necessarily be severe."*

Thus, the Sage still finds difficulty in such matters,
and therefore never faces great difficulty.

**Imperial Commentary:**
*"Disaster is often hidden in what is minute,
yet erupts when people overlook it.*
The Sage’s response to the world
is always to be cautious of the minute and never negligent,
so from the start there are no light or easy actions,
and thus great, unmanageable calamities are ultimately avoided.*

All this is without cause.

Wang Bi (王弼) said:
*"Even the Sage finds difficulty in what is minute and easy.
How much more so for those not of the Sage’s caliber,
who would dare to neglect this?"*
Hence it is said:
*"The Sage still finds it difficult,"*
for it is because of the difficulty in what is minute and easy
that there are ultimately no great difficulties.

Liu Renhui (刘仁会) said:
*"To deliberate before acting
is to avoid regret and hesitation.*
The Sage acts thus—how much more so for others?"*

This chapter’s three matters embody the Dao.
Thus, repaying resentment with virtue
is to address it while it is still easy and small,
and therefore there are no great difficulties.
Without embodying the Dao, who could be like the Sage?

**Chapter Sixty-Four: On Ease and Firmness in Holding** *(其安易持)*

Du Guangting said:
*"Those born with a naturally tranquil nature,
whose desires have yet to sprout—
to approach and uphold them is easy to grasp.
What has not yet manifested is easy to plan."*

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:
*"When a person’s true nature remains tranquil,
and one seeks to hold it steady,
preventing its scattering—
though the mind may stir,
its form and intent have not yet taken shape or measure,
so to suppress it is most effortless."*

Wang Yuanzhe said:
*"Discipline must come before the deed arises.
What is fragile is easily shattered;
what is subtle is easily dispersed."*

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:
*"When wicked intent first takes root,
it is still frail and perilous—
those who sever it find it easily broken.
When calamity first arises,
its signs are still faint—
to forestall it, what is faint is easily dispersed."*

Lü Jifu said:
*"What is fragile is easily shattered—
so one must not let it harden.
What is subtle is easily dispersed—
so one must not let it take root.
All things are thus, but the mind is most so.
If this is applied to the mind,
then all under Heaven and the state will face no difficulty."*

Wang Yuanzhe said:
*"To act at the very beginning of what has already arisen—
this is called ‘ordering before chaos takes hold,
acting before it exists,
governing before disorder arises.’"*

Yan Zun said:
*"Before sickness strikes, the patient is easy to heal.
Before a state is in peril, its counsel is easy to devise.
When troubles are but sprouts, they are easy to address.
When misfortunes are still weak, they are easy to avert.
How may this be demonstrated?
A cart’s axle unbroken, a child can guide it.
But when it topples—
overturned and crashing into valleys—
a thousand men cannot right it.
Before the egg is cracked,
a finger’s touch may halt it.
But once it becomes a flying swan,
flapping wings toward the clouds,
no net or snare can ensnare it.
A tree thick enough to embrace
begins as a hair’s tip.
A nine-tiered tower
rises from a single clod of earth.
A thousand-li journey
commences beneath one’s feet."*

**Commentary:**
*"All things with form—
the great must grow from the small,
the high must be founded on the low,
the distant must begin with the near.
In their inception, they are simple;
when complete, they are vast.
The Sage perceives the beginning and contemplates,
discerns the end before the finger moves—
thus he does not act before fortune arrives,
nor does he begin before calamity takes hold.
He deliberates before acting,
and thus achieves success."*

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:
*"This speaks of how evil arises from the subtle
and solidifies when it takes root.
Like a tree thick enough to embrace,
which begins as a hair’s tip—
this shows how it grows from its own nature.
A nine-tiered tower,
built from a single clod of earth—
this shows how habits accumulate.
A thousand-li journey,
starting with a single step—
this shows how distant paths are traversed without pause.
Thus, all under Heaven’s affairs
truly begin with the minute and subtle,
yet people often neglect them,
and so their roots become disasters.
Hence, three analogies are offered to confirm the foregoing."*

Du Guangting said:
*"People do not guard against what is nascent,
states do not heed what is subtle.
When disaster manifests, they seek to remove it;
when chaos is complete, they seek to govern it—
these are all failures of foresight.
From a hair’s tip to a tree thick enough to embrace,
it grows from small to great.
From a clod of earth to a nine-tiered tower,
it rises from low to high.
From a single step to a thousand-li journey,
it extends from near to far.
Yet men of the world,
seeing only the towering tree, the lofty tower, the distant path,
only then wish to wield the axe to fell it,
pile up the pickaxes to demolish it,
or gallop to chase it—
their labor is extreme, yet the calamity cannot be undone.
It is like leaning against the market gate and singing,
yet bringing ruin to the Jin dynasty.
Or like presenting the Sandalwood Deer,
nearly toppling the Han house.
Silent foresight and distant discernment—
these are what one must attend to with utmost care.
To act is to court ruin;
to grasp is to lose."*

「Emperor Tang Minghuang said: *"For"* means to labor and contrive. *"Execute"* means to cling and fixate.
He spoke of how people cannot act before things arise nor govern before chaos ensues,
yet instead contrive labor beyond their natural inclinations and fixate upon the dusty realms of the world,
thus inevitably inviting calamity and suffering loss.

 Lü Jifu said: To act before things arise is to not truly act in accordance with *for*.
 To govern before chaos ensues is to not truly govern in accordance with *treat*.
 Once things exist and one acts upon them, desiring their completion only to bring about their ruin.
 Once disorder has arisen and one governs it, clinging to it only to lose it in the end.

 Therefore, the Sage does nothing and thus meets no defeat,
 holds nothing and thus suffers no loss.

 *Imperial Commentary*: The Sage does not engage in worldly affairs,
 thus meets no defeat. He does not cling to anything as his own,
 thus suffers no loss. The more one deviates from the Dao/Way,
 the farther one strays from its rules. Can one truly avoid ruin and loss?

 Lü Jifu said: Thus, the Sage acts before things arise,
 yet does so through *non-action* (*wúwéi*), and so meets no defeat.
 Governs before chaos ensues,
 yet does so through *non-execution* (*wúzhí*), and so suffers no loss.
 The common folk, in their pursuits,
 often reach near completion only to meet ruin.

 *Imperial Commentary*: To halt midway, abandon halfway through, or begin with vigor only to end in slackness—
 these are the ways of the common folk, and none can escape them.
 Thus, their affairs often reach near completion only to fail.
 Lü Jifu said: The common folk, in their pursuits,
 act only after things have already arisen,
 thus reaching near completion only to meet ruin—
 for they do not know their fundamental nature.

 When the common folk reach near completion yet fail,
 it is because they do not heed their final steps.
 The *Book of Documents* says: *"To build a mountain nine *rèn* high,
 yet fail by one basket’s worth of earth."*
 To be as careful at the end as at the beginning,
 then there will be no ruined affairs.

 *Imperial Commentary*: Few can maintain their beginning to the end.
 To renew each moment as the start,
 applying this to affairs—
 what is there that cannot be accomplished?

 Emperor Tang Minghuang said: If one is vigilant in the final stages,
 ever preserving the mind of goodness from the start,
 then there will surely be no calamity or ruin.

 Lü Jifu said: If one knows that greatness arises from smallness,
 height from lowliness, and distance from proximity,
 and remains as careful at the end as at the beginning—
 how could there be any ruined affairs?

 Therefore, the Sage desires without desiring,
 does not prize goods that are hard to obtain,
 studies without studying,
 and corrects the errors of the common folk.

 *Imperial Commentary*: Those who seek profit exchange their nature for material things,
 and those who study diligently drown their hearts in trivial pursuits.
 How could this ever approach *non-action*?

 The Sage does not burden his form with profit,
 desiring only in *non-desire* (*bùyù*).
 Nurturing both self and others is complete when stopped,
 thus he does not prize goods that are hard to obtain.
 He does not extinguish the heavenly in himself for worldly gain,
 studying only in *non-study* (*bùxué*—
 cultivating brightness and harmony without contrivance),
 thus correcting the errors of the common folk.

 When the Dao/Way is not illuminated,
 even the worthy err in it—
 how much more so the common folk?
 To correct their errors and return them to their true nature—
 this is how scholars without worries find joy.

 Lü Zhi said: To discard gold as though it were mountain soil,
 to cast pearls into the abyss,
 to abandon the treasures of *extreme authenticity* (*jízhēn*),
 to sever the tools of exhausting skill (*qióngqiǎo*),
 this is what is meant by *desiring without desiring*.
 To forget about benevolence and righteousness,
 to abandon ritual and music,
 to cast aside the stale dregs of old teachings,
 to throw away the rotten husks of false doctrine—
 this is what is meant by *studying without studying*.

 Wang Yuanzé said: *Desiring without desiring* is not the absence of desire,
 but desire lies in *non-desire*—
 thus he does not prize goods that are hard to obtain.
 When the people have food to eat and warm clothing,
 these are necessities of their nature—
 to desire no more than this is not to have desire,
 yet after satisfying these needs, to further covet hard-to-obtain goods—
 this is the delusion of the foolish masses,
 straying far from their fundamental nature.

 Therefore, the Sage desires without desiring,
 to rescue them from their delusion and return them to their true nature.
 *Studying without studying* is not the absence of learning,
 but what is learned lies in *non-study*—
 to correct the errors of the common folk.

 The common folk chase trivial ends and engage in endless affairs,
 while the Sage, through *non-study* that corrects their errors,
 returns them to the Dao/Way.
 To assist the natural unfolding of all things,
 yet dare not to act.

 Lu Yu said: *Assist* means *aid*.
 Man is born in stillness—
 this is the nature of things.
 With *non-desire* and *non-study*,
 aiding the natural unfolding of all things,
 letting each fulfill its nature,
 yet daring not to act—
 what is there to do?
 It does not disrupt their inherent order,
 nor go against their natural inclinations.
 To aid their arising when they arise,
 to aid their form when they take shape—
 this is how the officials of *You* (有虞) managed affairs,
 and how the virtuous power of *Xia* (有夏) brought harmony to birds, beasts, fish, and tortoises.

 This passage speaks of how the Sage addresses difficulty in its ease.
 Thus, he holds fast in times of tranquility—
 this is what is meant by *acting before things arise*.
 He establishes order in moments of fragility—
 this is what is meant by *governing before chaos ensues*.」

«Take three matters as analogies. If one seeks to forestall future hardship by acting early, one must act without interference and without grasping—then all will be well. The Sage does not wish to still the people with *non-action* (无为) or to cut off learning with *non-study* (无忧), but rather to assist all things in their natural unfolding, thus embodying the Dao of *non-action*. Only then can one maintain ease in tranquility and avoid the burden of future difficulty.

The ancient masters who excelled in the Way did not seek to enlighten the people, but rather to keep them simple. *Commentary*: The people can be guided, but cannot be made to know.

The ancient masters who excelled in the Way merely led them.

To reverse their natural inclinations, the Way can be carried out, yet when one acts with them, no cleverness or artifice is needed.

Thus it is said: To keep the Three Dynasties and those below in simplicity, to release the unadorned *non-action* (恬惔无为), and to delight in the harmonious and plain (咛哼之意), bending and folding ritual and music to rectify the forms of the world, sighing and breathing forth virtue and righteousness to soothe the hearts of the people—this was done to enlighten them.

Though called *governance* (治之), what greater chaos could there be?

Wang Bi said: *Enlightenment* (明) means excessive perception and craftiness, dispersing their simplicity.

*Simplicity* (愚) means having no knowledge to guard, following nature.

Wen Gong said: To remove ornamentation and pursue reality, to return to purity and simplicity.

Cao Dao Chong said: When the people are clever, deceit arises; when the people are simple, they return to purity.

The enlightened one enlights the people with his cleverness, but not to enlighten them—that is what is meant by *not governing the state with cleverness*.

*Simplicity* is the opposite of cleverness; one seeks to keep the people simple, making them abandon cleverness and return to purity, forgetting distinctions, severing good and evil, and aligning with the state of *no knowledge, no desire*.

The difficulty of governing the people lies in their cleverness being too great.

Shu Wang said: The Sage’s cleverness is a state’s beneficial tool.

The ancient masters who excelled in the Way did not display their Sage’s cleverness to the people, but rather sought to keep them simple, without knowledge or desire.

Thus, Zhuangzi said: If the ruler truly loves cleverness yet lacks the Way, then the world will fall into great disorder.

How do we know this to be true? The more cunning the bows, crossbows, and snares are, the more the birds are disordered above. The more intricate the hooks, baits, nets, and traps, the more the fish are disordered in the water. The more refined the fences, enclosures, and traps, the more the beasts are disordered in the marshes. The more varied the clever distinctions of *allowing, gradual, poisonous, slippery, firm, white, resolving filth, and harmonizing differences*, the more the people are bewildered by sophistry.

Thus, the world often falls into great disorder, and the blame lies with the love of cleverness. Cleverness leads to deceit; simplicity leads to no knowledge. When the people are filled with clever deceit, cunning and falsehood flourish, making governance difficult.

Thus, governing the state with cleverness is the state’s ruin.

Lu Yu said: To uphold the Way and employ cleverness is to give rise to great falsehood.

Falsehood arises from below, cleverness from above; when the two deceive each other, the harm is great.

Tang Ming Huang said: *With* (以) means *to use*; *ruin* (贼) means *harm*. When a ruler employs clever ministers to govern the state, cleverness must inevitably produce laws. Laws bring forth deceit, and orders give rise to cunning, which is why the state grows increasingly corrupt and cleverness becomes the state’s ruin.

Cao Can guarded the law, yet the Han prospered through him; Shang Jun altered the law, yet Qin declined through him. Thus, the *Classic* above says: *When cleverness and wisdom arise, great falsehood follows*—this is the case.

Su Zi You said: I govern others with my cleverness; they also respond with their cleverness. Thus, the ruler and people deceive each other, and the harm is great.

Not governing the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.

Tang Ming Huang said: If one does not employ clever ministers but instead takes pure-virtued officials, who can rest and flourish, manage affairs and resolve difficulties naturally, then clever deceit will grow thin and simplicity will flourish. When the people are harmonious, the years will be bountiful—this is why it is the state’s blessing.

Liu Zhong Ping said: Not governing the state with cleverness is to *open the heavens* (开天); governing the state with cleverness is to *open the people* (开人). To open the heavens is to follow, and following means to act in what requires no effort—this is why their governance is not strict yet effective. To open the people is to pierce, and piercing means to lose oneself in excessive scrutiny—this is why their people are not simple but deficient.

Thus it is said: Governing the state with cleverness is the state’s ruin; not governing the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.

The *New Sayings* say: Yao and Shun’s cleverness lay in not restricting things; Yu’s cleverness lay in acting in what required no effort. Not restricting things means not scrutinizing them to claim enlightenment; acting in what requires no effort means not piercing them to claim utility—this is truly to excel in the use of cleverness.

If we speak of the Laozi’s *not governing the state with cleverness*, it lies in preserving it, and then the people will benefit a hundredfold.

Understanding these two principles is also the *standard model* (楷式).

He Shang Gong said: The two principles refer to cleverness and the lack of cleverness.

Those who always know cleverness are the ruin; those who lack cleverness are the blessing.

This is the standard model for governing oneself and the state.

Tang Ming Huang said: To employ clever deceit harms the people; to employ pure virtue blesses the state. When a ruler understands these two principles, he entrusts pure-virtued officials—this is the standard model for being a ruler.

Lu Ji Fu said: Understanding these two principles is not just for governing the state, but also serves as a standard model for oneself, and it is never violated.

Always knowing the standard model is called *Mysterious Virtue* (玄德).

He Shang Gong said: *Mysterious* (玄) is the *heavenly* (天). To always know the standard model for governing oneself and the state is to align with the virtue of heaven.

Tang Ming Huang said: *Mysterious* (玄) means *deep* (深) and *wondrous* (妙). When a ruler always knows whom to entrust, this is called the deep, far-reaching, wondrous, and supreme virtue.

Mysterious Virtue is deep and far-reaching, opposing all things—

*Commentary*: *Mysterious* (玄) is the color of heaven. To always know the standard model yet not use cleverness is to align with heaven’s virtue, deep beyond measure, far beyond reach, standing alone above all things, so that no thing can couple with it. Thus it is said: *It opposes all things.*»

Liu Renhui said: *Mysterious Virtue* is unfathomable, hence it is called *deep*. It is exhaustive in all directions, hence it is called *far-reaching*. Abandoning cleverness and entrusting to simplicity, hence it is said: *It opposes all things*.

*Mysterious Virtue* ascends and enters the realm of the *Small* (小), distinguishing itself from all things, hence it opposes all things. Only then does it reach the *Great Harmony* (大顺).

*Commentary*: *Harmony* (顺) is the *principle of heaven* (天之理). To reach the *Great Harmony* is to discard cleverness and return to simplicity, following only the principle of heaven.

Zhuangzi said: *"To align with Heaven and Earth, its alignment is seamless—
as if simple, as if confused—
this is called *Mysterious Virtue*,
in harmony with the *Great Harmony*."*

Only through such simplicity and confusion does one remove cleverness. Gu Huan said: *"Though it may seem contrary to worldly ways, it is in harmony with the Dao."*

This chapter speaks of the *Dao* being employed secretly, guiding the people without their awareness. Without cleverness or deceit, it returns to the purity of simplicity. If one knows this as the standard model, it is the profound, far-reaching, wondrous, and supreme virtue—discarding cleverness and following the principle of heaven.

**Chapter 66: The Jianghai (River and Sea) as Sovereign of All the Valleys**
*Collected by Master Li Lin of Song’s Rao County*

The Jianghai (River and Sea) is able to be the sovereign of all the valleys
because it excels in yielding.

Gu Huan said: *"The Jianghai dwells in lowliness,
thus all the valleys reverence it as their sovereign.
A ruler abides in humility,
and thus all things return to him.
Hence, he is able to be the sovereign of all the valleys."*

The Tang Emperor Minghuang said: *"The Jianghai’s ability to command all the rivers
to pay homage and make it their sovereign
arises from its excellence in occupying the lower reaches.
Thus, the *Yijing* says: ‘The Way of Earth transforms fullness into yielding flow.’
This is a metaphorical illustration.
When the Way of Earth employs yielding,
all the rivers converge and flow toward it.
When the Sage employs yielding,
the common people come as his children
and do not grow weary of him.
It is through lowliness and yielding
that one is able to be the sovereign of all the valleys.
The sovereign is the one to whom all things return.
If one yields, the people will return to him
like water flowing downward.
Thus, the Sage who seeks to elevate others
does so through his words of yielding.
Whoever seeks to precede others
places himself behind in deed.
Hence, though he dwells above,
the people do not feel burdened;
though he stands before,
the people do not feel harmed.
Master Shàngshǔ Gōng said: ‘To be above others,
follow the Jianghai’s example of humility.
To precede others,
act first for others, then for oneself.’
The Sage, though above the people as their ruler,
does not oppress them with his exalted position,
so they revere him without feeling the weight.
The Sage, though before the people,
does not obscure those behind with his brilliance,
so the people love him as they would a parent,
and have no thought of harming him.
Thus, all under heaven willingly promote him
and never tire of doing so."*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"The Sage’s possession of the world—
in terms of his station, he is indeed the one above others.
Yet, when he is called ‘孤’ (*gū*, solitary),
‘寡’ (*guǎ*, few), or ‘不谷’ (*bùgǔ*, unblessed),
and bears the shame and ill fortune of the state,
it is because of his words of yielding.
In terms of his order—
he is indeed the one who precedes others,
yet he is pressed to act only after being compelled,
moved to respond only after being touched,
and rises only when there is no alternative—
this is because he places himself behind in deed.
If he dwells above but the people do not feel burdened,
then the burden of reverence becomes light.
If he places himself behind in deed,
then though he stands before, the people do not feel harmed,
and thus they follow him as a benefit.
No burden, no harm—
this is why all under heaven willingly promote him
and never tire of doing so.
Because he does not contend,
all under heaven cannot contend with him."*

Luo Shi said: *"The heart and form being empty,
who could contend with one who possesses nothing?"*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"Because he yields in words
and places himself behind in deed,
he does not contend.
All under heaven willingly promote him
and never tire of doing so,
so none can contend with him.
Those who do not embody *Mysterious Virtue*—
could they ever be like this?
Thus it is said: ‘Because he does not contend,
all under heaven cannot contend with him.’
This chapter takes yielding as its core:
The Jianghai excels in yielding,
so it is the sovereign of all the valleys.
The Sage yields in words and places himself behind in deed,
so all under heaven willingly promote him
and never tire of doing so.
Who could contend with one who yields?"*

**All Under Heaven Say: My Dao**
*All Under Heaven Say: My Dao Seems Like the Unresembling*

All under heaven say: *"My Dao seems like the unresembling."*

Du Bì said: *"Unresembling means ‘not conforming to things.’
Since it does not conform to things,
it is called unresembling.
Only because it is vast,
it seems like the unresembling."*

Sū Zǐyóu said: *"The Dao is spacious and formless,
decayed and nameless.
It pervades all things,
yet does not resemble any one thing—
this is why it is vast.
If it resembles things,
then it is merely one thing,
and how could it be vast?
If it resembles, then it has long been small."*

The *Yizhù* (Commentary) says: *"Resembling things is small;
being resembled by things is vast.
The Dao encompasses all things—
how vast it is!
Thus, if it seems like the unresembling or resembling,
then the Dao has something outside of it—
how could it still be vast?"*

Wáng Bì said: *"‘It has long been small’—
this is also to say ‘its smallness has long endured.’
If it resembles, it loses its basis for being vast.
Thus it is said: ‘If it resembles,
then it has long been small.’"*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"All under heaven merely see my Dao’s vastness
and say it seems like the unresembling,
yet they do not know why it is vast—
indeed, it seems like the unresembling.
How so? The vast Dao is boundless,
its influence cannot be confined to left or right,
it is everywhere without exception.
If it is everywhere without exception,
there is nothing to doubt—
yet they call it unresembling without knowing
that its vastness lies in its unresembling.
If it resembles anything,
then there would be something outside the Dao,
and if the Dao has something outside of it,
then it is not everywhere—
could it still be vast?
Wáng Yuànzé said: ‘Resembling means
that something resembles the Dao,
and the Sage is the progenitor of all things.
Thus, those who embody the Dao,
things should resemble him—
how could he resemble things?
If there is resemblance,
then he is an image of that thing.
If he is an image of that thing,
then that thing must be vast,
and he would be small.
I have the Three Treasures,
to cherish and uphold them.’"*

The Tang Emperor Minghuang said: *"Though my Dao is vast,
it does not resemble anything,
yet there are these three practices—
most precious indeed!
If one can always cherish, lean upon, and uphold them,
they can govern oneself and govern the state."*

Wáng Yuànzé said: *"All these Three Treasures—
though worldly sentiment calls them small,
they are the basis by which the highest person is vast."*

The first is *cì* (compassion).
Wáng Yuànzé said: *"Compassion is rooted in love;
love is the virtue of benevolence toward things,
yet it is uniquely called compassion—
for when it transforms, it spreads vast virtue
to cover all below, reaching its peak at the end.
The *Laozi* speaks of its origin,
so it does not say ‘transform,’
but says ‘compassion.’
Compassion is the fundamental Way of the fatherly Dao,
and it does not rely on artificial means."*

Táng Zhì said: *"Compassion is love.
The *Liji* says: ‘For the man who is a father,
his virtue stops at compassion—
this is beneficial.’"*

**Compassion** is the foundation of humanity.
The Dao of father and child is innate to nature.
A person’s compassion and filial piety arise from their inherent nature,
requiring no external reliance.

The **virtuous** is the essence of humanity,
taking universal love as their heart—
this is far removed from innate nature.
The *Laozi* elucidates the essentials of virtue and power,
thus treasuring compassion as the jewel.

The **Prophet**’s Five Constants place benevolence first.
The **Buddha’s** Ten Precepts forbid killing above all.
Though the Three Sages differ,
they all ground themselves in compassion—
thus they are one.

**The second is frugality.**
Gu Wén said: *"Treasure vital essence, cherish qi—
do not indulge in extravagance."*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"In conduct, he moves with measured restraint,
taking moderation as his standard—
is this not frugality?"*
Frugality is the shared virtue of power.
Great Yú cultivated himself,
considering extreme frugality as expenditure.
King Wén governed by promoting restraint as transformation.
Great indeed is the virtue of frugality!
The *Shū* says: *"With reverence and frugality, virtue is achieved."*

**The third is not daring to lead the world.**
Gu Wén said: *"Walk in humility, dwell in the rear—
do not take precedence over others."*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"Never taking the lead,
yet always following others,
while all take precedence,
he alone takes the rear—
is this not not daring to lead the world?"*

Wáng Yuànzé said: *"In the *Yì*, this is ‘humility.’
Heaven, Earth, humanity, and spirits—
all hold humility as noble,
thus the Sage treasures it.
The Sage of Confucius grounds himself in the Dao of benevolence,
takes frugality and yielding as virtue,
and treasures these three as well."*

**Compassion thus enables courage.**
Wáng Bì said: *"Compassion, when deployed, conquers;
when held firm, it endures—
thus it enables courage."*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"Compassion is soft and weak,
yet it overcomes rigidity—
this is courage."*

Mèngzǐ said: *"The benevolent have no rival."*
Shùn’s nature was benevolent,
yet his form was punished with four crimes.
Tāng’s benevolence conquered,
overcoming Xià Jié’s tyranny.
King Wén treated the people as wounded—
truly compassionate—
yet his single anger settled the world’s people.
Is this not courage?

**Frugality thus enables breadth.**
Gu Wén said: *"Cultivate the body, cherish qi—
then life and nature prolong themselves.
Govern the state, cherish the people—
then virtue and transformation spread naturally.
Frugality in self-cultivation preserves spirit;
restraint in governance ensures surplus resources.
The *Shū* says: ‘Be cautious with your frugal virtue,
and hold fast to enduring plans.’"*

**Not daring to lead the world thus enables completion as an instrument.**
*Commentary*: *"The Way of Heaven is to triumph without contending.
The Way’s exaltation makes one the foremost instrument."*

Hé Shànggōng said: *"Not daring to lead the world,
yet completing as an instrument—
this is the Dao-person.
I can be the foremost among Dao-persons."*

Shū Wáng said: *"If one does not dare to lead the world,
then none will dare to lead them—
thus they complete as an instrument."*

Now they abandon compassion for courage,
frugality for breadth,
and humility for precedence—
they are doomed.

*Commentary*: *"The world knows that courage suffices to conquer others,
yet they do not know that compassion alone enables courage.
They know that breadth suffices to boast before the masses,
yet they do not know that frugality alone enables breadth.
They know that completion as an instrument is worthy of reverence,
yet they do not know that taking the rear is essential—
thus they are merely rigid and strong,
and their path leads to death."*

Gu Wén said: *"Discarding compassion and mercy,
they instead seek daring—
this is reckless abandon, valuing fearlessness as courage.
Not treasuring their qi, they dissipate their essence;
not cherishing others, they expend their strength;
abandoning humility, they only seek precedence—
such conduct leads only to death."*

**Compassion, when wielded in war, conquers;
when held in defense, it endures.**
*Commentary*: *"The benevolent have no rival in the world,
thus they conquer in war.
The people love their ruler as limbs protect the head,
as children defend their parents—
they die in defense without retreat,
thus they endure in defense."*

Táng Mínghuáng said: *"Using compassion in war benefits in preserving the multitude.
Using compassion in defense benefits in securing the people.
Each safeguarding their own security,
thus they conquer and endure."*

Heaven, intending to rescue them, shields them with compassion.
*Commentary*: *"Those who aspire to benevolence are drawn by Heaven’s sincerity.
Those who aspire to non-benevolence lose Heaven’s mirror.
Thus Heaven rescues and shields them—
it does so through compassion alone."*

This is why compassion is first among the Three Treasures.
Hé Shànggōng said: *"When Heaven intends to aid the virtuous,
it endows them with the nature of compassion and benevolence,
so they may aid themselves."*

Wáng Yuànzé said: *"The Three Treasures all take compassion as their heart.
Speaking of Heaven’s rescue and protection,
it is because of their compassion.
This chapter speaks of the three great Treasures of the Way—
among them, compassion is the root,
thus the passage ends with Heaven rescuing and shielding them through compassion."*

**Chapter 68: The Virtuous Warrior Does Not Rely on Force**
Lú Yù said: *"A warrior is a general who does not rely on force—
meaning he does not oppress others with force."*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"A warrior’s name signifies ‘affairs of the Dao,’
and his task is to lead others.
In affairs of the Dao, he does not contend for victory;
in leading others, he uses their strength—
where is the need for force?
Like Shì Nán Yíliáo resolving two households’ dispute by juggling,
or Sūn Shū’áo lying down with a feather fan while the Yǐng people laid down arms."*

**The skilled warrior does not grow angry.**
*Commentary*: *"The highest warfare subverts strategy,
yet anger truly overcomes deliberation."*

Hé Shànggōng said: *"The skilled warrior, wielding the Dao,
restrains evil in the heart,
cuts off calamity before it arises—
there is no need to punish with anger."*

Shū Wáng said: *"Not growing angry is to be a skilled warrior."*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"For a warrior to have no need of force,
the skilled warrior does not grow angry,
the skilled victor does not contend,
the skilled leader places himself below others—
this is fitting indeed."*

War is a perilous affair.
The skilled warrior laments the people and punishes crime—
how could there be private anger to employ peril and harm the people?

If the Shang King Wu overthrew Jie, as did King Tang in deposing Jie—this is how one conquers an enemy without contention.

*The skilled victor does not contend.*
*Commentary*: Contention is contrary to virtue.

To fight for land, the dead fill the fields;
to fight for cities, the dead fill the streets—
victory and defeat are yet undetermined.

It is through non-force that force is perfected,
through non-anger that anger is fulfilled,
through non-contention that contention is transcended—
these three arise from virtue, hence they are called *skilled*.

Hé Shànggōng said: *"The skilled warrior who conquers by the Dao
attracts the near with benevolence,
draws the distant with virtue,
and does not contend with the enemy—
yet the enemy surrenders of its own accord."*

Liú Rénhuì said: *"Virtue moves things to submission—
thus it is called conquering the enemy.
Weapons do not clash—
thus it is called not contending."*

Contention is contrary to virtue.
Not to contend yet to conquer—
this is what is called *skilled*.

Warfare is most noble when strategy is struck down;
repeatedly exchanging blows is not the highest use of arms.
A hundred battles, a hundred victories—
this is not the skillful use of warfare.
The skillful user of arms conquers without battle—
this is the supreme skill.

The skillful leader places himself below others.

*Commentary*: Though wisdom encompasses heaven and earth, it does not presume—
thus the wise are employed for counsel.
Though ability exhausts the seas within, it does not act alone—
thus the capable are employed for service.
Though eloquence carves through all things, it does not boast—
thus the eloquent are employed as messengers.

Hé Shànggōng said: *"The skillful leader who relies on assistants
must practice humility and deference."*

Zhuǎn Wēi said: *"The skillful leader employs virtue, not force.
Thus, using ministers of support and counsel,
they are compared to limbs and sinews of the body.
Using generals,
they kneel to receive their commands,
and march while pushing their chariots forward—
this is the virtue of non-contention."*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"Those who embody the Dao do not contend.
If they do not contend, none in the world can contend with them.
Thus, the skilled warrior does not wield force,
the skilled victor does not grow angry,
the skilled conqueror does not contend—
this is called the virtue of non-contention.
This is called employing the strength of others."*

*Commentary*: The clever exhaust their sight and hearing,
the capable exhaust their schemes and abilities—
yet those who place them in position have no such need.

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"Those who embody the Dao can humble themselves.
Those who humble themselves have others gladly serve them,
yet do not rely on themselves alone.
Thus, the skillful leader places himself below others—
this is called employing the strength of others.
This is called aligning with the Dao,
the ancient pinnacle."*

*Commentary*: Non-action as action is called the Dao.
Not contending yet employing others—
thus one can align with the Dao,
reaching the utmost that cannot be surpassed.
Hence it is said: *The ancient pinnacle is the utmost pinnacle.*
The most perfect wood is the ridgepole—
this chapter speaks of the skilled warrior not wielding force.

Not to grow angry, not to contend,
to employ the strength of others—
this is not wielding force.
Virtue does not contend;
strength employs others—
thus one can align with the Dao,
and non-action cannot be exceeded.

**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Use of Arms**

When using arms, I dare not be the aggressor,
but only the responder.

*Commentary*: The one who provokes is the aggressor,
the one who responds is the defender.
To act only when pressed,
to rise only when compelled—
this is called responding with arms.
Responding with arms is to be the defender.

Gù Huān said: *"To act first in the state or move first in battle is to be the aggressor.
To harmonize yet not provoke,
to act only when pressed—
this is to be the defender.
To act first or move first is to invite danger through arrogance.
Now, desiring to follow the Dao and respond to others
to preserve oneself—
since one does not act first,
this is not being the aggressor.
Since one acts only when compelled,
this is being the defender."*

I dare not advance an inch,
yet retreat a foot.

*Commentary*: Not delighting in killing,
advancing is difficult, retreating is easy.

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"The aggressor is contrary, the defender is compliant;
the aggressor labors, the defender rests;
advancing is arrogant, retreating is humble;
advancing is hasty, retreating is composed—
to meet contrariness with compliance,
to meet labor with rest,
to meet arrogance with humility,
to meet haste with composure—
these are not to be opposed."*

Wáng Yuànzé said: *"Not eager for slaughter."*

This is called *action without action*.

*Commentary*: The skilled warrior does not wield force,
acting yet leaving no trace.

Emperor Xuánzōng of Tang said: *"To retreat as the defender,
not to contend with others—
though engaging the enemy,
it is as though there were no action."*

Zhāng Jūnxiàng said: *"Arms arise from others;
I truly do not act.
Responding to things and moving—
though acting, it is as though there were no action."*

Wáng Yuànzé said: *"The most benevolent warfare
has campaigns without battles,
and is as though there were no action."*

*Without arms to raise,*
Emperor Xuánzōng of Tang said: *"Raising the arm is to display anger;
the skilled warrior does not grow angry—
if there are no arms to raise."*

*Yet without an enemy,*
*Commentary*: The skilled conqueror does not contend.

Gù Huān said: *"‘Yet’ means to draw out.
Once people submit to virtue,
the troops are disbanded and returned—
though one might wish to provoke an enemy,
there is none left to provoke."*

*Without weapons to grasp,*
*Commentary*: Employing the strength of others,
there is no need to grasp weapons.

Emperor Xuánzōng of Tang said: *"To grasp weapons is to display killing;
now, with benevolence and harmony as the principle,
though one grasps weapons,
it is as though there were none."*

Wáng Yuànzé said: *"Though there is the name of battle,
there are none before to oppose—
thus it is as though there were no battle."*

No greater calamity than to treat the enemy lightly.

Chéng Xuányīng said: *"To perceive the enemy’s terrain yet be reckless,
stained by worldly dust,
leads to the three woeful paths."*

To treat the enemy lightly risks losing one’s treasure.

Chéng Xuányīng said: *"‘Risks’ means to exhaust.
To treat the enemy lightly is to love courage yet lack benevolence,
to expand greed yet lose frugality,
to love advancing yet forget retreat—
all three treasures are exhausted."*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"If one cannot emerge from non-action,
knowing the aggressor yet not the defender,
knowing advance yet not retreat—
this is called treating the enemy lightly.
To treat the enemy lightly is to lose one’s benevolence
and forfeit the hearts of the seven peoples and all things."*

Thus, when armies clash,
the one who first displays mercy will win.

「Wang Yuanzé said: *"The heart of compassion—this is virtue.
Virtue is why one can be courageous, and thus prevail.*
Another reading has ‘相若’ (mutually comparable), which also makes sense.
‘若’ here refers to armies clashing in arms.
This chapter speaks of wielding arms when there is no alternative,
thus being the guest in conflict,
and yielding by a foot—
not daring to treat the enemy lightly,
for fear of losing one’s treasure.
Hence, when armies clash,
the one who shows compassion and mercy will prevail.

My words are easy to understand, easy to follow.
Yet none in the world can understand, none can follow.
The imperial commentary states:
*The Dao is bright and easily seen,
so when spoken of, it is easy to understand.*
It is simple yet easy to uphold,
so when encountered, it is easy to follow.
Mencius said:
*The Dao is like a broad road—
yet how could it be difficult to know?*
Thus, the Dao has no difficulty,
yet the world has none who cannot find it difficult—
those who cannot,
simply do not seek it within themselves.
Su Ziyou said:
*The greatness of the Dao lies in restoring one’s nature—
and this is enough.*
The wondrous applications of nature
are seen in one’s daily actions and meals.
The sage points to this and shows it to others—
is it not easy to understand?
If one can embody this to respond to things—
is it not easy to follow?
Yet the world often suffers from knowing yet not recognizing,
and even knowing, cannot follow—
how much less can it follow?

Easy to understand, easy to follow—
because of its utmost simplicity.
It cannot be grasped by mere thought or reasoning,
so it is called *‘not thinking yet knowing.’*
Because of its utmost proximity,
it cannot be reached by slow or hasty steps,
so it is called *‘not walking yet arriving.’*
Using intelligence to know it,
one’s understanding will be shallow—
thus, none in the world can truly know it.
Using force to follow it,
one cannot attain—
thus, none in the world can truly follow it.
Words have a root, affairs have a lord.
The imperial commentary states:
*Words cannot be exhausted,
yet principle is their foundation.*
*Affairs cannot be fully addressed,
yet the Dao is their sovereign.*
Following principle to seek understanding,
and adhering to the Dao to act—
then the world has no difficulty.
Words take *non-speech* as their root;
affairs take *non-action* as their lord.
Obtaining the root makes understanding easy,
recognizing the lord makes action easy.
Those in the world who cannot understand or cannot follow,
simply do not know their root or their lord.
Only those without knowledge,
are why they do not know me.

Wang Bi said:
*‘Being clothed in coarse sackcloth yet holding jade within’*—
clothing in coarse sackcloth means blending with the common,
holding jade within means treasuring one’s true essence.
The sage is difficult to know,
because they blend with the common yet do not stand out,
hold jade within yet do not display it—
thus, they are difficult to know and yet noble.
Coarse sackcloth is the garment of the vulgar,
jade is the precious treasure.
Clothing in coarse sackcloth means appearing crude externally,
harmonizing one’s light with the dust,
acting as if foolish or dim-witted,
not differing from the common.
Holding jade within means concealing treasure inwardly,
embracing the Dao and nurturing virtue,
hiding one’s name and reputation,
not revealing oneself to others.
This differs from the vulgar crowd who flaunt jade on their sleeves.
Zhuangzi said:
*The sage holds it within themselves,
while the common people debate to show it to others.*
This chapter states that the Dao is easy to know and easy to follow,
yet none in the world can know or follow it—
because words have a root and affairs have a lord.
Only those who have the root and lord,
are why the knowing ones are few.
The sage is difficult to know,
because they treasure this Dao and wear coarse sackcloth.

**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**
Knowing the unknown is supreme.
Not knowing yet claiming to know is an affliction.

Lǚ Jìfǔ said:
*The essence of the Dao is
to know without knowing yet be able to know.*
To recognize one’s own ignorance,
and yet know through that ignorance—
this is the highest attainment.
Thus it is said: *‘Knowing the unknown is supreme.’*
Though one recognizes their ignorance,
yet insists on knowing through knowledge—
their mind is mediocre and unpeaceful.
Thus it is said: *‘Not knowing yet claiming to know is an affliction.’*

Wen Gong said:
*‘Knowing yet acting as if one does not know,
keeps one distant from blame.’*
*‘Not knowing yet insisting on knowing,
invites disaster.’*
Only by recognizing the affliction of affliction,
does one avoid affliction.
Tang Minghuang said:
*‘Only by recognizing the affliction of insisting on knowing,
does one not fall prey to that insistence.’*
The sage is not afflicted,
because they recognize affliction—
thus they are not afflicted.

Lǚ Jìfǔ said:
*‘Only by recognizing the affliction of knowing as an affliction,
and yet overcoming that affliction,
does one return to non-knowing—
and then knowledge is no longer an affliction.’*
Thus, the sage is not afflicted—
this is why.

Nanbo Ziqí said:
*‘I pity those who destroy themselves.
I also pity those who pity others.
I also pity those who pity those who pity others.’*
Later, he said: *‘Far indeed.’*
If one like Ziqí’s tea,
can be called *‘recognizing the affliction of affliction’*?

Wang Yuanzé said:
*‘If one is afflicted yet does not recognize it,
the afflicted will never awaken.’*

This chapter speaks of the **Dao/Way** having no inherent knowing—
knowing that one does not know is superior,
but if one does not know yet acts,
and knows through knowing,
then this becomes an affliction.

The sage’s non-affliction lies in
knowing knowing as an affliction,
and returning to non-knowing—
thus they are not afflicted.

**Chapter 72: The People Do Not Fear Threat**

If the people do not fear the **threat/menace**,
then great threat will come.

**He Shang Gong** said:
*"Threat is harm.
If people do not fear small harm,
then great harm will come—
speaking of death.
Those who fear it should cherish their vital essence and nurture their spirit,
harmonizing with Heaven and following Earth."*

**Cheng Xuan Ying** said:
*"Within, they understand the threat of penalties—
the scriptures, precepts, and laws.
The great threat refers to the punishments of the Three Hells (Skt. *naraka*), the Northern Cities of Retribution (*Douluo Yanzheng*), and the *Tianluo* realm.
All beings, not yet comprehending true **dharma/principle**,
indulge in worldly **laws** and act lightly,
so the true **dharma/principle** brings great punishment,
which must surely come."*

**Liu Zhong Ping** said:
*"The **Book of Poetry** says:
‘Fear the awe of Heaven,
and in time, you will be preserved.’
Indeed, the multitude does not know to fear Heaven’s awe,
so great threat comes.
That which has threat to be feared is called threat.
When the multitude does not fear Heaven’s awe,
they do nothing they should not.
This is why Heaven descends its great calamity and retribution,
and the disasters and punishments are applied.
Thus it is said:
‘Great threat will come.’"*

*"The **Book of Documents** says:
‘None dare act without fear,
but those who do not fear will be made to fear.’
Do not constrain their dwelling,
**Commentary:** ‘Dwelling’ refers to the abode of nature.
Human nature is vast and unrestricted—
it cannot be enclosed or bent.
The scholar does not speak of the **Dao/Way**,
because their dwelling is constrained.
Expand and fulfill it,
and it will fill Heaven and Earth,
embrace the Six Extremes (*liuji*—the four cardinal directions and heaven and earth),
and nothing will be beyond its reach.
Mencius said:
‘Dwell in the broadest place of the world.’
The Tang Emperor Ming Huang said:
‘The abode of the spirit is the heart.’
Do not constrain their dwelling—
this means removing emotions and desires,
making them pure and void,
so that the spirit may dwell within without constraint.
Do not satiate their birth—
**Commentary:** ‘Birth’ refers to the gathering of **qi**.
Human birth is connected to the transformations of all things,
but those who satiate their birth
are bound by the actions of day and night,
and their **qi** is diminished.
Those who preserve the Great Harmony (*Dahua*—the perfect balance of Heaven and Earth)
and do not perish by the **middle path** (*Zhongdao*—the path of moderation),
do not satiate their birth."*

**He Shang Gong** said:
*"Why people are born is because they have spirit.
The spirit depends on emptiness and purity,
loves tranquility and stillness,
but if eating and drinking are unregulated,
and one neglects the **Dao/Way** while indulging in sensuality,
then perverse and disruptive **qi** fills the body,
and this is how life is cut short and the spirit scattered."*

**Liu Zhong Ping** said:
*"‘Do not constrain their dwelling’—
this is the foundation of **virtue/power**.
‘Do not satiate their birth’—
this is the root of **virtue/power**.
The foundation of **virtue/power** is to fulfill nature,
and the root of **virtue/power** is to reach the vital essence of life.
Thus, the sage does not use human means to extinguish Heaven’s **virtue/power**,
nor does they use worldly ways to diminish life’s essence.
**Wang Yuanze** said:
‘Human nature is originally broad and flowing,
but as worldly teachings decline,
they cannot restore it to its pristine state,
so they narrow their dwelling and make it constrained,
and they block their birth and make it stifled.
Only by constraining their dwelling
do the people become impure and false.
Only by satiating their birth
do the people become thin and shallow.
But the sage is not so—
they let the people roam freely in the broadest place of the world,
and each fulfills their vast and unrestrained nature,
so who among them would dare to provoke Heaven’s threat?’"*

**Zhuangzi** said:
*"The garden of the **Wei** family,
the park of the Yellow Emperor,
the domain of Yao and Shun,
the palace of Tang and Wu—
this is the world of the sage.
The world declines and grows narrow in its dwellings.
But the sage has no superiority or inferiority—
their dwelling grows narrow only because the times they encounter are so."*

*"Only by not satiating
is one not satiated."*

**He Shang Gong** said:
*"Only those who do not satiate their spirit
wash away the filth of the heart,
being serene and content without desire,
can have the spirit dwell within them without satiation."*

**Gu Xuan** said:
*"People do not satiate their birth,
and their birth does not satiate them.
People do not abandon the **Dao/Way**,
and the **Dao/Way** does not abandon them.
Thus it is said:
‘Birth and people mutually preserve,
people and the **Dao/Way** mutually benefit.’
The **Western Ascension Scripture** says:
‘The spirit always loves people,
but people do not love the spirit.
If people do not satiate their spirit,
then the spirit will dwell within them and not depart.
Thus, the sage knows themselves but does not display themselves,
loves themselves but does not exalt themselves.’"*

**He Shang Gong** said:
*"They know their own gains and losses,
yet do not reveal themselves outwardly.
**Virtue/power** and beauty exist externally but are stored internally.
They love their own body to preserve their vital **qi**,
yet do not elevate themselves in status or honor.
They cherish their name in the world."*

**Lü Jìfǔ** said:
*"The sage knows themselves in constancy yet does not display themselves outwardly.
Their body knows constancy while their outward actions transcend it—
this is how they do not constrain their dwelling.
They love themselves through moderation yet do not exalt themselves through excess—
their birth is preserved while their life is not squandered—
this is how they do not satiate their birth."*

**Liu Jin Xi** said:
*"Preserving and nurturing true nature,
not lightly indulging in desires—
this is self-love.
Modesty, humility, stillness, and retreat,
placing others before themselves—
this is not exalting themselves.
If they know themselves through clarity yet do not display themselves through boasting,
then their nature is broad, and nothing can obscure it—
this is ‘not constraining their dwelling.’
If they love themselves through virtue yet do not exalt themselves through belittling others,
then their birth is complete, and nothing can harm it—
this is ‘not satiating their birth.’
If this is so,
how could they ever provoke Heaven’s threat?"*

Thus, one discards that and takes this.
**Gu Xuan** said:
*"Discarding that and taking this—
if one sees the exalted as noble, then external punishments will fade.
If one knows and loves, then inner sufficiency of life and **Dao/Way** will be fulfilled."*

This chapter speaks of
the upper losing its great **Dao/Way**’s transformation,
and the people losing their true nature of life.
Thus, though there are threats to be feared,
they do not fear them.
Only by not constraining their dwelling to fulfill nature,
and not satiating their birth to reach life’s essence,
could they ever provoke Heaven’s threat?
Thus, one discards that which exalts and displays,
and takes this which knows and loves—
also making the people broaden their dwelling and not constrain it,
preserving their birth and not satiating it.

The sage’s discernment in discarding and taking
is clearly visible.

**Chapter 73: On Bold Courage**

*"Bold in daring leads to death.
Metuan said: ‘Fearlessness is courage; resoluteness is daring. To see threats and fear them not, yet act without hesitation—this is the art of forcing *qi* to destroy the body.

Chen Xuanying said: ‘Courage is fierce advancement. Daring is resolute resolve. Death is annihilation. If one advances yet lacks resolve, clinging to worldly affairs, then annihilation follows.

Luó Shì said: When the mind is steadfast in action, resolute in seeking, truly abandoning evil and inviting virtue, one meets one’s fate—thus it is called death.

Bold without daring brings life.
Luó Shì said: If one acts with gentleness and goodness alone, one gains benefit—this is life, the way of long endurance. If the heart is empty and detached, not clinging to defilements, then there is long life.

Metuan said: To stand alone, fearless, yet not daring to act—guarding softness and yielding fully—this is the way to preserve life.

Shū Wáng said: Zhuangzi said: ‘The Sage treats the necessary as unnecessary, thus wields no arms. The common man treats the unnecessary as necessary, thus wields many arms. Bold in daring treats the unnecessary as necessary, thus wields many arms and meets death. Bold without daring treats the necessary as unnecessary, thus wields no arms and lives.

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: Those who wield their strength and fixate on externals are bold in daring—these are the doomed. Thus it is said: *Bold in daring leads to death.*

Those who govern with gentleness and fixate on nothing are bold without daring—these are the living. Thus it is said: *Bold without daring brings life.*

These two paths—one brings benefit, one harm.
Hé Shànggōng said: The two refer to daring and not daring. Preserving life is benefit; destroying life is harm.

Wang Bì said: Both are forms of courage, yet their applications differ—thus benefit and harm arise. Hence it is said: *One brings benefit, one harm.*

Lǚ Jìfǔ said: Bold in daring may seem beneficial, yet harm lies within. Bold without daring may seem harmful, yet benefit lies within. What Heaven abhors, who knows its reason?

Official Commentary: Those who deviate from humanity align with Heaven. What benefits humanity, Heaven abhors—who can know its source? Thus even the Sage finds it difficult.

Official Commentary: Those who follow Heaven endure; those who defy it perish—even the Sage dares not alter this.

The Way of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs well.
Official Commentary: All things emerge, and Heaven emerges with them without resistance. All things return, and Heaven receives them without obstruction—this is called not contending. Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness, accompany all things, yet all their abundance comes from received fate—this is called not contending yet triumphing well.

Táng Mínghuáng said: Below, it speaks of Heaven’s humility and emptiness, admonishing human boldness. Heaven does not contend with things; the four seasons wax and wane without resistance—thus it triumphs well.

It does not speak yet responds well.
Wáng Yuānzé said: How does Heaven speak? The seasons move, myriad things flourish, rewarding virtue and punishing licentiousness—all changes respond without a word.

Liú Rénhuì said: Silent and still, thus it is called ‘not speaking.’ Yet when moved, it responds—thus it is called ‘responds well.’

It is not summoned yet comes.
Official Commentary: Those who receive fate can summon it, yet Heaven governs all things’ fates—who can summon them? It simply follows the natural course of *qi*.

It moves with effortless ease, yet plans with consummate skill.
Cài Zǐhuǎng said: Though vast and unconstrained, it plans with precision—good and evil differ not by a hair.

Wáng Yuānzé said: Ever easy, thus unconstrained; knowing peril, thus plans well.

Heaven’s net is vast, sparse yet nothing escapes.
Official Commentary: Dense yet with gaps—this is human artifice. Heaven, though sparse, has no gaps. Accumulated virtue and vice bring retribution in kind—thus nothing is lost. Yet only through contention does one triumph, only through speech does one respond—this is humanity. Heaven does not contend yet triumphs well, does not speak yet responds well. Summoned, it arrives; yet to know Heaven is difficult for humanity. Heaven arrives unsummoned, unconstrained yet plans well.

Only the Sage can embody this, thus does not seek benefit nor shun harm—always benefiting, never harming—thus aligning with Heaven’s virtue, differing from those bold in daring.

Cáo Dàochōng said: Nothing escapes Heaven’s net—vast yet encompassing all. Though sparse, nothing slips through. Encompassing all six directions, no thing escapes within—this is Heaven’s net. *Héihéi*—vast indeed. Though seemingly sparse, rewards and punishments differ not by a hair.

This chapter speaks of bold daring and not daring. Bold daring is what Heaven abhors—even the Sage finds it difficult. Below, it speaks of Heaven’s humility and emptiness, urging it as a model. The people do not commonly fear death—

**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Commonly Fear Death**

*The people do not commonly fear death—how then can you frighten them with death?*

Metuan said: *Nàihé*—how, as in ‘how can this be?’ When Dao and virtue decay, punishments grow harsh and cruel, then life is not cherished, death not feared. People do not fear death because governance is oppressive. If they do not revere great virtue in life, yet you impose severe punishments to instill fear, the people will defy laws and never reform.

Luxury and licentiousness drain the vital essence and *qi*, causing the spirits to scatter—driven to perilous acts that shock the soul. When the ruler loses the Way, the people lack constancy, defying laws—what is there to fear in death? Yet the ruler still threatens death, using saws and axes, ropes and measuring lines, yet chaos never ceases—this is the case of Qin and after.

If the people commonly feared death, and acted strangely, I would seize and kill them—who would dare?"*

The Imperial Commentary states: *"The world delights in life yet often violates the law. Only then do those with strange words face punishment, and those with deviant conduct face prohibition. As Coeficial Master said, the crime of defying governance is indeed grave."*

River Master declared: *"If one governs through the Dao/Way and the people still do not comply, instead engaging in strange artifices, then the king’s law should be applied—seizing and executing them. Who would dare transgress?"*

Laozi lamented the times: *"The ruler does not first cultivate the people with virtue and the Dao/Way, but instead begins with punishments and penalties."*

Wang Bi remarked: *"Deviance disrupts the true—this is called ‘strange.’ The constant agents of execution carry out the killings."*

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *"Such deceitful and strange individuals—none escape the Heavenly Net. It is the constant agents of execution who carry out the killings."*

Du Guangting explained: *"司 (sī) means ‘master.’ Heaven’s nurturing of humanity is profound, its love for them is supreme. The Southern Palace’s Golden Register rewards virtue and oversees life, while the Northern Palace’s Black Ledger records offenses and governs death. Heaven and Earth, along with the myriad spirits, oversee and judge good and evil, using them to admonish and encourage, so that evil may be abandoned and virtue cultivated. Thus, those with merit extend their years, while the guilty have their fate diminished—no fraction is lost, as in the meticulous reckoning of the Yang Palace. Heaven has the Four Official Stars of Destiny, located between Xu and Wei, beside the Human Star, overseeing humanity. These Four Official Stars are what the *Three Elements Scripture* calls ‘Heaven’s agents of execution.’*

*"To substitute as the agent of execution is to usurp the Great Carpenter’s axe. River Master said: ‘If a ruler seeks to execute in place of Heaven, it is like a clumsy man substituting for the Great Carpenter in hewing wood—laboring without success.’ To substitute for the Great Carpenter in hewing wood is to rarely avoid injuring one’s own hands. River Master said: ‘When a ruler enforces punishments, it is like a clumsy man substituting for the Great Carpenter in hewing wood—squares and circles will never align, and he will inevitably harm himself. To usurp Heaven’s execution is to disrupt its order. Without proper order, one will instead invite calamity.’*

Lu Jifu asked: *"How should the Sage govern the world through the Dao/Way?"*
*"Simply let the constant agents of execution carry out the killings—do not usurp their role."*

What are the ‘constant agents of execution’? The Heavenly Net is vast yet never fails to ensnare. Heaven’s retribution for crimes employs the Five Punishments and Five Executions—this is the role of the agents of execution. If executions arise from personal bias rather than Heaven’s retribution, then it is usurping the role of the agents of execution. To usurp the agents of execution is to usurp the Great Carpenter’s axe—rarely does one avoid injuring their own hands. Thus, the harm of usurping the agents of execution is clear.

This chapter states that when the people lack constancy and do not fear death, one must first cultivate them through the Dao/Way, not intimidate them with punishments. If the people fear death and those who act strangely are executed, who would dare transgress? Yet one must not execute oneself—there are Heaven’s agents of execution. If one usurps their role, it is like substituting for the Great Carpenter, and none escape harming themselves.

*Conclusion of Volume Eleven of the *Collected Virtues of the Dao/Way and Its Power Scripture***
*Beginning of Volume Twelve of the *Collected Virtues of the Dao/Way and Its Power Scripture***

「Thus, the people’s hunger arises from the excessive taxes and levies imposed by their rulers—hence their hunger. *The Imperial Commentary* states: Heavy taxation leads to widespread barrenness of fields and crops, and the people lack sufficient food.

 Lü Jiufu remarks: If one man’s labor can feed several households, why should there ever be hunger? Yet when hunger does arise, is it not precisely because of the excessive taxes and levies demanded by their rulers?

 Wang Yuanzhe asserts: If one establishes official salaries and implements the rites of taxation properly, it would be to enrich the people. But when expenditures grow lavish while the foundations of governance weaken, and taxes multiply while essentials decline, the result is merely that the people starve.

 The Duke of Zhou imposed heavy taxes, leading to the rise of Chu. *The Book of Songs* composed the *Huge Rat* ode to censure the Duke of Wei for his oppressive taxation.

 The difficulty of governing the people stems from the rulers’ excessive interventions—hence their difficulty in being governed. *The Imperial Commentary* states: When governance is intricate, deceit and falsehood flourish, and the people lose their simplicity.

 Liu Jinxi notes: Excessive intervention makes governance cumbersome; non-intervention simplifies affairs. Simplicity is easy to follow, while intricacy is hard to govern.

 The six passions are hard to control because of the rulers’ excessive interventions. Lü Jiufu says: Weaving yields clothing, tilling yields food—this is called harmonizing virtue. Why should governing be difficult? Yet when governance becomes difficult, is it not because of the rulers’ excessive interventions?

 Wang Yuanzhe states: If one entrusts discerning officials to manage affairs, it would be to govern the people. But when men are burdened by customs and refined by worldly influence, craftiness and deceit proliferate, making governance even harder. Observing the ancient past and later ages confirms this truth.

 Shun governed through non-intervention, enabling his rule as Emperor. Wu governed with relaxed oversight, securing his reign as King. The rise and flourishing of emperors and kings all originate from this principle.

 *The Scripture* says: To govern through non-action is to ensure nothing remains ungoverned.

 The people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive pursuit of life—hence their lightness toward death. *Zuan Wei* explains: Heavy taxation and cumbersome governance strip the people of their livelihoods, driving them to compete for treasures and risk laws and prohibitions. They court death recklessly because their pursuit of means to sustain life is too fervent, leading to those who fear neither drowning nor burning, nor wielding blades.

 Lü Jiufu says: If their food is sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyful, why should they ever regard death lightly? Yet when they do regard death lightly, is it not because their pursuit of life’s sustenance is too fervent?

 Wen Gong observes: The pursuit of profit is meant to nourish life, yet the people often lose their lives through profit. Overvaluing life while greedily seeking profit inevitably leads to courting danger, and thus they view death lightly.

 Only those who do not cling to life for its own sake are wiser than those who prize it. *The Imperial Commentary* cites *Zhuangzi*: "Those who understand the nature of life do not strive for what life cannot provide." Not clinging to life means abandoning what life cannot provide. To forsake worldly affairs and relinquish life’s burdens is the way. When one’s form is unlabored and essence unexhausted, form preserved and essence restored, one aligns with Heaven—this is wiser than merely prizing life.

 Prizing life differs from regarding death lightly; relinquishing life’s burdens is wiser than merely prizing it. Extending the principles that benefit one’s own life to the people would result in light taxation and few punishments, ensuring households are well-provided and people are content, while distinct clothing and customs would prevent transgressions. This is the ultimate achievement of emperors and kings.

 This chapter speaks of heavy taxation and cumbersome governance, which strip the people of their livelihoods, leading them to regard death lightly. These three issues all harm the essentials while neglecting the foundations. Prizing life differs from regarding death lightly, while not clinging to life’s burdens is wiser than merely prizing it.

*Chapter Seventy-Six: On the Nature of Life and Death*

The nature of human life is soft and weak, while death brings rigidity and strength. *He Shang Gong* says: In life, humans contain harmonious *qi* and embrace spirit, hence their softness and weakness. In death, harmonious *qi* is exhausted and spirit departs, hence their rigidity and strength.

 All things, grasses, and trees are soft and pliable in life—*He Shang Gong* says: Because harmonious *qi* remains. In death, they wither and decay—*He Shang Gong* says: Because harmonious *qi* disperses.

 Yan Zun explains: Where *yang qi* resides, trees can be bent and grasses can be tied. Where *yang qi* departs, water can solidify and ice can break. Thus, rigidity and strength belong to death, while softness and weakness belong to life.

 *He Shang Gong* says: By observing these two phenomena, one knows that rigidity and strength signify death, while softness and weakness signify life.

 Emperor Ming of the Tang dynasty remarked: It is clear that those who preserve their softness and weakness remain alive and long-lived, while those who grow rigid and overbearing perish and lose their nature.

 Lü Jiufu says: *The Dao* is a thing without form yet not contentious. Thus, it is the most soft and weak in the world, yet none comprehend it. Hence, to illustrate it with things of form: The nature of human life is soft and weak, while death brings rigidity and strength. Grasses and trees are soft and pliable in life, but wither and decay in death. Even though these things have form, they die through rigidity and strength, and live through softness and weakness—how much more so the Dao, which has no form, yet does not lead to softness and weakness! It is impossible to attain.

 Therefore, when armies grow strong, they cannot prevail—*The Imperial Commentary* states: When opposing armies clash, the sorrowful will triumph.

 Wang Zhen notes: The remnants of Xia and Shang, with armies numbering in the hundreds of thousands, overthrew the four seas. Yet at the end of Qin Shi Huang’s reign, despite his unified empire, he lost all nine regions. Xiang Yu rose to power swiftly and perished just as quickly. Wang Mang usurped the throne and was destroyed soon after. Fu Jian was defeated in humiliation at the Huai River; Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty collapsed in splendor at the Chu Palace. These numerous dynasties all fielded armies of tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, yet none failed to rely on their strength, only to meet defeat—this is all evidence that when armies grow strong, they cannot prevail.

 Armies that rely on their strength inevitably become arrogant and haughty. Arrogance and haughtiness are the paths to ruin and annihilation. Qin Shi Huang was at his strongest, yet his dynasty did not last two generations before collapsing. The Xiang family’s sudden rise to power was swiftly followed by extinction. When wood grows rigid, it splits—*The Imperial Commentary* says: Even the sturdy *tong* or *zhi* trees, when bent, are known to crack.」

「When strong, they are felled and split. Lush forests invite the axe—when wood is strong, it is felled and split. The mighty are brought low, while the yielding rise.

*The Imperial Commentary* notes: The yielding overcomes the rigid, the weak overcomes the strong—this is the Dao/Way and skill of the Master Laozi, as Lao Dan [Zhuangzi] demonstrates with his emphasis on moist-weakness and humble yielding.

Gazing upward at Heaven, Heaven accumulates *qi* and thus stands above; Earth accumulates form and thus lies below. Taking examples from the natural world, the flexible branches yield while above, the sturdy trunk stands firm below. By this analogy, it is clear that the rigid and strong reside below, while the yielding and weak stand above.

This passage broadly discusses how all beings—whether human or otherwise—thrive through yielding and weakness, perish through rigidity and strength. Those who seek to preserve the Way of life must surely take heed of this.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven of *The Dao of Heaven***:
The Dao/Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow. The lofty are pressed down, the lowly are raised up, the overabundant are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented. *The Imperial Commentary* notes: The Dao/Way of Heaven holds the mean as supreme, thus pressing down the lofty so they do not become excessive, raising up the lowly so they do not fall into deficiency. It advances those who are about to come, withdraws those who have succeeded. The Four Seasons cycle in turn, each attaining its proper *chǔ* [seasonal order/position].」

**严遵** said: The artisan who crafts a bow neither overbends nor underbends it, neither slackens nor over-tightens it. He shapes it by the compass and plumb-line, ensuring strict alignment. If the string is too taut and high, he relaxes and lowers it; if the string is too slack and low, he tightens and raises it. Where there is excess, he carves away to diminish it; where there is deficiency, he fills and supplements it. The string and the bow’s body balance each other—upper and lower in harmony—with evenness as the principle and attunement as the norm. Thus, the bow may be struck, and the arrow may fly true.

The principle of pressing down the high and raising the low, diminishing the excessive and supplementing the deficient—this is the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth.

**Zhang Junxiang** said: The art of using a bow lies in this: the high must be feared for excess, so it is pressed down lest it rise too far. The low must be feared for insufficiency, so it is raised lest it fall too low. Neither too high nor too low—this is the mean, the measure of perfection. In governance, too, one must seek this equilibrium: excessive height invites rejection, while harming the low invites censure. Pressing down the high and raising the low—this aligns with the natural order.

**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang** said: Only when the bow is thus attuned can one strike true. This is like the Dao/Way of Heaven, which diminishes excess and supplements deficiency, teaching rulers to emulate Heaven’s *de* [virtue/power] and govern humanity accordingly—hence the principle of pressing down the high and raising the low.

The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency.
*The Imperial Commentary* notes: *"Fullness invites loss; humility invites benefit—this is the Dao/Way of time."* But the Dao/Way of humanity is reversed: the deficient are sacrificed to serve the excessive.
*The Imperial Commentary* notes: Human nature elevates the low to oppress the high, favors the few while fearing the eminent.

**Wang Yuanzai** said: Human governance follows inclination, thus it is unequal.

**He Shangong** said: The Dao/Way of humanity is contrary to that of Heaven. Common folk diminish the poor to enrich the rich, plunder the weak to empower the strong. Who, then, can use their excess to nourish the world, but the sage alone?
*The Imperial Commentary* notes: Only the sage does not oppress the few while exhausting the many, nor does he fear the eminent while depriving the generous. Only the sage can do this.

**He Shangong** said: Who can occupy a position of excess, yet voluntarily reduce their rank and wealth to nourish those in want? Only the sage-ruler can act thus.

**Wang Yuanzai** said: The sage harmonizes with the Dao/Way of Heaven. Therefore, the sage acts without claiming merit, achieves without taking credit, and does not seek to display virtue.

**Luóshī** said: Having attained this emptiness and openness, free from thought and deliberation, how could one’s mind and intellect desire to exalt their own wisdom and ability? The sage acts without arrogance, achieves without self-satisfaction.

「If one relies on their actions to claim merit and achievement, then they will be seen as virtuous, and such virtue will inevitably lead to the self-serving path of using excess to invite loss.

This chapter speaks of the Dao/Way of Heaven, where moderation is supreme. Thus, it suppresses the high to elevate the low, reduces the excessive to supplement the insufficient. The sage follows Heaven’s Dao, not relying on actions or achievements to display their virtue, so they receive benefits without suffering loss. Only those who understand Heaven’s Dao can do this.

**Chapter 78: The Soft and Weak of the World**

Nothing in the world is as soft and weak as water, yet nothing can surpass it in overcoming hardness and strength. There is no substitute for it.

**Lǚ Jífǔ** said: Among all things in the world, only water can conform to the curves and straightness, angles and roundness of objects, flowing with them. Thus, nothing is as soft and weak as water. Yet it can carry great vessels, turn massive stones, pierce steep cliffs and valleys, and float and bear all things under Heaven—only water can do this. Hence, nothing can surpass it in overcoming hardness and strength. This is so because, though it twists and changes in myriad ways, it never loses its essence as water. This is why there is no substitute for it. Water adapts to all things yet never alters itself, for its softness and weakness. If people can embody this, though they face countless transformations, their minds remain steadfast and unchanging. Thus, they can overcome all things without harm.

Therefore, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong. All under Heaven know this, yet none can practice it.

**Hé Shànggōng** said: The tongue is soft, the teeth are hard, yet the teeth perish before the tongue. Water can extinguish fire, yin can consume yang. Those who know the enduring nature of softness and weakness, and the harm that comes to hardness and strength, should be ashamed of their arrogance and fondness for aggression. Hence, the sage speaks of this.

This refers to the following text.

To bear a nation’s impurities is called the **Duo Ji** sovereign.
To bear a nation’s misfortunes is called the **King of All Under Heaven**.

**Wang Yuanzhe** said: The Sage’s ability to embody softness and weakness lies in taking water as his virtue.

To bear a nation’s misfortunes—does this not mean embracing filth and enduring humiliation?

To draw all the world’s crimes upon oneself is to receive the nation’s impurities and filth.
Thus, as a ruler of a single state, he calls himself *"lonely," "widowed," "unworthy"*—this is to bear the nation’s misfortunes.
Hence, all under Heaven turn toward him.

**Right speech as if reversed.**

**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Reversed for the petty wisdom of near-emotion, yet aligned with the utmost rectitude of the Dao.

**Su Ziyou** said: Right speech aligns with the Dao yet opposes convention. The common folk see bearing impurities as shame, bearing misfortunes as calamity—thus it is.

This chapter speaks of softness and weakness overcoming hardness and strength.
Hence, it first uses water as an analogy, then cites the Sage’s words to confirm it.

**Chapter 79: Harmonizing Great Grievances**

To harmonize great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances—how then can it be called good?

**Lü Jifu** said: Those who seek vengeance do not break their spears; though they harbor resentment, they do not blame the wind and tiles. Thus, the world attains balance. If one does not follow this path, grievances will only multiply. Yet people still strive to harmonize them endlessly.

Thus it is said: To harmonize great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances.

*"The unvirtuous, I too treat with virtue"*—this is how one cultivates true virtue.

To harmonize great grievances yet still leave lingering grievances—how then can it be called good?

A ruler cannot avoid action, yet if he is humble, yielding, and soft, the people will grow greedy and quarrelsome, and grievances and hatreds will flourish.

If the ruler enacts laws to restrain them—those who kill are put to death, those who injure are punished—yet if he harmonizes and repays their grievances, how can deceit grow worse and hatreds multiply? How then can it be called good?

Thus, the Sage holds the **left contract**.

**Hé Shànggōng** said: In ancient times, the Sage held the left contract, using inscribed tablets and matching seals as proof.

Without written laws or statutes, they carved contracts and matching seals to establish trust.

**Lü Xisheng** said: In ancient times, they tied knots to make agreements, and the people did not deceive. They split wood into contracts, and the people did not violate them. Why? Because the Sage had no fixed intentions—he took the people’s hearts as his own.

Thus, the Sage’s heart and the people’s hearts were like left and right contracts. When the contract came, they aligned without blame, so ruler and subjects grew close, and grievances did not arise.

**Li Rong** said: In ancient times, the Sage carved wooden contracts—the ruler held the left, the subject the right—as proof, sealing them with matching seals. They did not rely on laws or statutes, imposing no penalties on things, hence *"without blaming others."*

Thus, without punishment or blame, what grievances could there be to harmonize?

**Wang Bi** said: The left contract prevents the origin of grievances, yet does not blame others.

**Lü Jifu** said: Thus, the Sage holds the left contract without blaming others—this is how those who seek vengeance do not break their spears, though they harbor resentment, they do not blame the wind and tiles, and the world attains balance through this path.

Indeed, in ancient times, those who offered oxen and horses held the right contract—the right contract was for taking, the left for giving. Thus, the left contract was always given to others, never held as possession.

The Sage acts yet does not rely on it; when his work is done, he does not claim it. He always gives in abundance to the world. Even when killing, he lets officials execute, yet never takes personal responsibility—this is holding the left contract, giving to others without possession, the way of having no grievances and not blaming others.

Is this not because harmony is not a source of joy?

**Wang Yuanzhe** said: The left contract takes from others; the right contract takes from people. The left is without action, the right holds authority—thus the ancient division of contracts was so.

The Sage holds the left contract, not interfering in things, yet things come to align with him. He responds to their alignment—this is called *"responding and thus communicating with all under Heaven."*

Then, the Sage always bears the world’s blame yet harbors no blame toward others—thus, he remains without grievance.

**Zhuangzi** said: *"To gain is attributed to others; to lose is attributed to oneself."* **Tang** said: *"All under Heaven have faults; the fault lies with me."* This is what is meant.

*The Records* say: Those who offered oxen and horses held the right token—clearly, the offering party presented both tokens together, so the left token was held by the one bearing responsibility.

*The Historical Records* say: The right contract was used to demand accountability.

Thus, the virtuous hold the contracts;

**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Not interfering in things, yet responding to their alignment.

**Yan Xian** said: Seeking within oneself.

A virtuous ruler oversees the contracts and trust, preventing grievances from arising, and only then does he blame others.

The unvirtuous oversee **through** (彻).

**Hé Shànggōng** said: The unvirtuous ruler betrays his contracts and trust, overseeing others’ failures.

**Yan Xian** said: Seeking without.

**Shu Wang** said: If one oversees *through* (彻) to the end of matters, he cannot avoid blaming others. If he cannot avoid blaming others, he cannot make others without grievance—this is why he is unvirtuous.

*彻*, to penetrate.

The unvirtuous seek to penetrate all things, yet harbor the heart of harmony and grievance.

Mercy is penetration.

Is this not the source of obstruction?

Thus it is said: *"Joy in penetrating things is not the Sage’s way."*

The Dao of Heaven has no favorites; it always aligns with the virtuous.

**Commentary:** If virtuous, it aligns with them—what favoritism is there?

**Lü Jifu** said: Without favoritism, yet aligning only with the virtuous—this too is the way of holding the left contract without blaming others.

**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Only Heaven is without intention, yet it clearly aligns with virtue—Heaven and the Sage share the same path.

This chapter speaks of how having the heart to harmonize grievances is not as good as having no heart and merely overseeing contracts. To harmonize grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances; to oversee contracts is to not blame others.

「The Dao of Heaven has no favorites—only the virtuous does it favor, and this is also the way of holding the left contract without blaming others.

**Chapter Eighty of *The Dao of the Small State and Few People* (*Xiǎoguó guǎmín*):**
The Small State and Few People.
**River Master** said: Though the Sage governs a great state, he still treats it as small, demonstrating frugality and restraint, not indulging in extravagance. Though the people are many, they are treated as if few—so no one dares to burden them.

**Zang Xuanjing** said: A state with little land is a small state. A people with few soldiers is few people.

**Wang Yuanzhe** said: In a small state with few people, the populace is pure and honest. But in a great state with many people, interests and harms clash, and crafty deceits arise. Observe the people in the capital and those in the rural settlements—their manners differ starkly between guile and sincerity. Thus, a small state means simple governance, and few people mean honest folk. Simple governance and honest folk can restore the administration of the Great Ancients.

Though there are implements for every ten or hundred households, they are not used.
**Duke Shou of Shu** said: If the people are few, then my needs are also narrow. Thus, in a small state with few people, even if there are implements for every ten or hundred households, they are not used.

**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Implements shared by ten households are called *shí* instruments. Implements shared by a hundred households are called *bǎi* instruments. Under the governance of simplicity and stillness, the aim is to let the people fulfill their natural inclinations without needless labor or contrivance, so there will never be matters of collective migration or warfare. Hence, though implements exist for every ten or hundred households, they are not used.

Let the people value death and not seek distant resettlement.
**River Master** said: If a ruler can create benefits and remove harms for the people, ensuring each finds their proper place, then the people will value death over life and cherish their existence. If governance and commands are not burdensome, the people will be content with their occupations and thus will not seek distant resettlement, abandoning their familiar dwellings.

**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Those who find joy in life and fulfill their nature will value death. Those who are at peace with their land and have no desires will not seek distant resettlement. Those who value death do not lightly regard life. Those who share life with others but do not value their own existence are different. Those who do not seek distant resettlement are at peace in their homes. Those who scatter among the myriad people and are not at peace in their homes are different.

Though there are boats and carriages, they have no need to ride them.
Though there are armor and weapons, they have no need to display them.
**Commentary:** There are no urgent journeys across perilous terrain, so though boats and carriages exist, they are not used. There are no battles to be fought, so though armor and weapons exist, they are not displayed.

**Zanwei** said: Hollowing wood makes boats, to ferry across water; carving wheels makes carriages, to traverse land. These are for distant travel. In an age of non-action, mountains have no paths or tunnels, marshes have no boats or bridges—since travel is already severed, what need for riding or display?

**Zhang Junxiang** said: Weapons are used to punish rebels, martial might to quell disorder. Once the ruler upholds the Dao, the people naturally turn to virtue and follow transformation—why would there be need to display weapons?

Boats and carriages are metaphors for the *Small Vehicle* (小乘), armor and weapons for the *Small Wisdom* (小智). When the people’s hearts are at ease, these are truly abandoned and unused.

**Wang Yuanzhe** said: If the people suffice within their natural endowments, then there will be no calamities of distant travel or warfare.

**Cao Daochong** said: Great states do not encroach; small states defend their lands. Armor, helmets, spears, and halberds—why use them if there is no war?

Let the people return to using knotted cords to record matters.
**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Governance is simple, the people are honest—so there is no need for written contracts.

**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang** said: Boats and carriages are for the convenience of migration; armor and weapons are for waging war. Since both are not desired, they are not used, and the people revert to simplicity, returning to the use of knotted cords.

**Explication:** In ancient times, before writing was invented, knotted cords were used to record events. Thus, the *Systematic Discourse* says: "In the Upper Antiquity, knotted cords were used for governance; later, the Sages replaced them with written contracts, desiring to show that in the age of knotted cords, people were all pure and simple." Once writing emerged, deceit and artifice grew daily. Now, to make people forget their emotions and desires and return to purity and simplicity, it is said: "Let the people return to using knotted cords."

Let their food be simple, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyous.
**Commentary:** They till the soil and eat; they weave and wear. With mouths full, they play; with bellies satisfied, they wander. If the people can attain this, then:
- Stopping at what is proper makes food sweet.
- Removing ornamentation makes clothing fine.
- Not being disturbed makes dwellings secure.
- Preserving life makes customs joyous.

**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang** said: Not coveting rich flavors makes their food always sweet. Not laboring over embroidered patterns makes their clothing always fine. Not adorning their homes makes their dwellings secure. Not corrupting simplicity and purity makes their customs joyous.

Neighboring states are visible to one another, and the sounds of roosters and dogs can be heard. Yet the people die of old age without ever visiting each other.

**Wang Yuanzhe** said: This is the governance of fulfilling nature, and the people also fulfill their nature. I have often examined the closing passages of *The Analects* and *Mencius*—both end by praising the virtuous deeds of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang. It seems that if one applies this book to governance, its effects will match those of the Sages of those ages.

Laozi was the greatest Sage. Yet the changes he encountered were precisely when the world reverted to its original simplicity and fulfillment of nature. Thus, he alone illuminated the meaning of *virtue* and *power* (德道), gathering scattered matters and uniting them in simplicity and sincerity. If one applies his book to governance, the people will transform and customs will flourish—this chapter’s effect is proof of it. Hence, the *Text’s* intent concludes here.

**Lü Jifu** said: Since the Three Dynasties, until the decline of Zhou, its culture became greatly corrupted. The people lost their natural and vital essence, so Laozi’s words saved them by emphasizing simplicity and returning to the governance of the Great Ancients. Yet the words of *The Book of Poetry* and *The Book of Documents* only reach as far as Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties—why does Laozi seek to return to the governance of the Great Ancients?

He replied: The Dao and the world have long corrupted each other. Only the Great Dao can make people return to their natural and vital essence. If one speaks of the Dao without addressing its worldly manifestations, one cannot truly know that the Great Dao has already been tested. This is why it must necessarily return to the Great Ancient Dao.»

The world has long departed from the Great Ancient Dao—can it all be restored?
He said: Not yet.

Then what is the purpose of his words?
He said: Ritual reached its fullness in the combined practices of the Three Kings, and music in the complete forms of the Six Dynasties. Yet even then, ritual did not place the *xuanshui* (玄水) and *dajīng* (大羹) beneath the *lìjiǔ* (醴酒) and harmonized soups, nor did music add the *huǐguǎn* (嘒管) and clear *qìngqìng* (清磬) above the *zhūxián* (朱弦) and sparse *shūyuè* (疏越)—this was to make people understand the true intent of ritual and music. What was unavoidable was to refine and return to the origins in this way.

At that time, Confucius was seeking to restore the lost traditions of Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, while Laozi expounded on the Dao to match the times—his intent was no different.

It is like the month of *sì* (巳) when fire reigns, yet the *jīn* (金) qi has already emerged within it. This is how the Five Phases succeed one another without interruption.

Thus, though the ancients had tenfold or hundredfold tools yet did not use them, had boats and carriages yet did not ride them, had armor and weapons yet did not display them, when great matters arose, they gathered the people—this was unavoidable. Though their people used knotted cords for records, neighboring states were within sight and hearing, yet they grew old and died without visiting one another, it was only when governance grew burdensome, when officials were pressed to enforce laws and supervise travel, that footsteps reached the borders of neighboring states and carriage tracks stretched beyond a thousand *lǐ*—this too was unavoidable.

What was unavoidable was always here, yet what they sought to restore was always there.

Then would the Sage not weary of elaborate governance to correct the people’s excesses?

Yet if one seeks a world that is not at peace and prosperity, it cannot be attained. Even if he spoke no more, still he would have set aside the *xuanshui* and removed the *shūyuè*—who would know the ritual’s true simplicity and the music’s moderation, or the intent to return to the origins?

The words of the Sage—how could they be mere trifles?

When neighbors live close yet do not interact, when voices are heard but no demands are made, this is the utmost of *wuqiú* (无求). This chapter speaks of small states and few people, where governance is simple and the people pure—thus the Great Ancient Dao could be restored. From the time of knotted cords onward, all was the Great Ancient Dao.

If one truly upholds this book to transform the people, such restoration could be achieved.

*"Sincere words are not ornate"* (信言不美), Chapter Eighty-One.

Shū Wáng said: *"Sincere"* is nature. When words approach nature, they are perfect, and this is the utmost harmony of the world. Hence, sincere words are not ornate.

To govern the world, when the food is sweet, the clothing is fine, the dwelling is secure, the customs are joyful, and the aged die without mutual visits, then governance has reached its peak. If one then gathers and returns to the Dao, this is why it follows with *"sincere words are not ornate."*

Wáng Yuànzé said: *"Sincere words"* are essential to the Dao. The Dao expressed through speech is plain and without flavor—how could there be ornamentation?

*"Theft"* speaks of excessive sweetness; sweetness is the beauty of flavor.
*"Prostitute"* speaks of extravagance; extravagance is the beauty of color.
*"Craftsman"* speaks like a bellows; bellows are the beauty of sound.
*Sincere words* are those spoken in accordance with the Dao, plain and without flavor, yet not departing from the Dao. Speech without ornate words is not mere appearance. Speech without melodious charm is not mere empty rhetoric. This is why they are not ornate.

Ornate words are not sincere.

Héshàng Gōng said: Ornate words are embellished, flowery language. Insincerity is the adornment of falsehood and the proliferation of emptiness.

Jì Wáng said: If words are ornate, they cannot approach nature. Hence, ornate words are not sincere.

Wáng Yuànzé said: To speak of affairs without reference to the Dao, though it may please the shallow ears of the unenlightened, it is not profound discourse. Hence, it cannot be fully sincere.

The virtuous do not argue. Those who truly practice the Dao do not engage in debate or persuasion. Those who argue are not virtuous.

Táng Mínghuáng said: Empty, hollow argumentation is why they are not virtuous.

Wáng Yuànzé said: Speech is only for illuminating the Dao. The Dao is concise and unburdened—why use excessive words?

Kǒngzǐ said: *"The purpose of speech is to convey meaning."*

The wise are not all-knowing. *御注*: The wise grasp the subtleties of the Dao, returning to its essence. The *经* says: *"Few words suffice."* *Zhuānwēi* says: The wise understand their Dao. They are clear in principle and know its roots, obtaining its essence alone—why need they be all-knowing? This is what is meant by *"few words suffice."* Those who are all-knowing are not truly wise. *御注*: The more one hears and sees, the more one should simplify.

Zhuāngzǐ said: *"Extensive knowledge is not necessarily profound; eloquence and debate are not necessarily wise."*

Héshàng Gōng said: Those who are all-knowing have many experiences but lose the essence and truth.

Sū Zǐyóu said: *"If one has a single thread that unifies all things, then there is no need for extensive knowledge—yet daily growth does not necessarily mean understanding the Dao."*

The Sage does not accumulate.

Wáng Bì said: Without private possession, one naturally has abundance; only goodness is given, and things are fulfilled as they come. When one gives to others, one’s own abundance increases. When one gives to others, one’s own abundance grows ever more.

Wáng Yuànzé said: *"To act for others"* means to apply oneself to affairs and governance of the world. To follow their momentum and benefit them, then one’s Dao is not diminished, and one’s affairs become ever more expansive. *"To give to others"* means to impart the Dao. To impart the Dao is like the heavens giving birth to things—I have never expended anything, yet things multiply daily. Since it is said *"the Sage does not accumulate,"* it is also clarified that one can satisfy all things. Only by not accumulating can one truly suffice.

Cáo Dàochōng said: *"The richness of boundless generosity is inexhaustible; the response of non-accumulation is limitless. Marvelous use arises daily, and the more one seeks, the more one finds—great generosity gives daily, and the more one takes, the more one prospers."* If one accumulates, then there is insufficiency. If one has no hoarding, then there is abundance.

The Sage’s non-accumulation is also mere emptiness. Emptiness is why one can respond to all demands, while fullness cannot be diminished. This is how one gives to others—one’s own abundance increases, and the more one gives to others, the more one’s own abundance grows.

The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming; *御注*: Though the *乾* begins by benefiting and sweetly nourishing the world, it does not speak of what it benefits, yet all things are truly benefited by it—never does it cause harm.

Lú Yù said: Human affairs benefit one thing while harming another. The Dao of Heaven is balanced, so there is benefit without harm.

Gù Huān said: The virtuous obtain the Dao to fulfill their nature; the wicked obtain the Dao to transform their nature. All return to the One, benefiting without harming.

Heaven follows the Dao, hence in spring and summer it nurtures and grows, while in autumn and winter it matures and ripens. This is benefiting without harming.

The Sage’s Dao acts without striving. Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *"The words of Lǎozǐ—when observing inwardly the hearts of all, outwardly all things, upward to Heaven, and downward to Earth—there is nothing that does not accord with them. This is sincerity. Yet the common scholar hears them and laughs, the world thinks them like the unworthy. This is not ornate. When speech is most natural, its meaning is most profound—this is virtue. Yet they do not delight in speech—this is not argumentative. Their wisdom reaches to no-wisdom—this is wisdom. Yet their simplicity never departs from my heart—this is not all-knowing. Yet scholars seek ornamentation, argumentation, and extensive knowledge, and thus they are distant. The Dao of Lǎozǐ—though the Sage’s wisdom, it still rejects and abandons accumulation. Hence, reaching to no-accumulation, it satisfies all demands of things, and this is why one’s own abundance increases and grows ever more. Yet scholars cannot carve their hearts here, and thus they cannot attain this Dao. All things have what benefits them and what does not benefit them. What does not benefit them cannot avoid harming them. Only Heaven’s Dao—having no benefit, there is no non-benefit; having no non-benefit, it benefits without harming. All things that act—none do not have ‘self.’ Having ‘self’ means having strife. Only the Sage’s Dao—though acting, it is without action. Being without action means without ‘self,’ and without ‘self’ means without strife. This is the Dao of Heaven alone. The Sage follows Heaven’s Dao—though acting, it arises from non-action. Transformation and fulfillment occur in affairs, yet there is no strife with things. Thus, one’s sagely accomplished deeds are preserved."*

This chapter summarizes the essence of the *经*, speaking in accordance with the Dao. The Dao is plain and without flavor, hence it is not ornate.

The Way is spoken of to illuminate the Dao, hence it is not embroidered.
The Dao is essential and not burdensome, hence it is not extensive.
The Sage embodies the Dao, hence does not accumulate.
Thus, when one attains the utmost of having no need to fulfill the demands of all things, the more one has, the more one possesses.
Heaven follows the Dao, hence benefits without harming.
The Sage follows Heaven, hence acts without strife.

If one truly seeks to embody the teachings of Dao and virtue, there is none more exalted than benefiting things while not engaging in strife, hence this is where it concludes.

Dao and virtue, when unified, are discussed before form takes shape. Before form, Dao and virtue are both hidden.
After form appears, Dao and virtue are both revealed.
What is Dao? That which all things follow is Dao.
What is virtue? That which is inherent within Dao is virtue.

When viewed from their differences, Dao and virtue, though bearing two names, are distinct.
When viewed from their unity, Dao and virtue, though named separately, remain inseparable in essence.
Dao descends as virtue, yet virtue has never been separate from Dao.
Virtue arises from Dao, yet Dao has never been separate from virtue.

The *Nanhua Jing* states:
"From the One, there arises a One yet unformed. That all things obtain from this to be born is called virtue.
When spoken of as the One yet unformed, it is called Dao.
When spoken of as that from which all things obtain to be born, it is called virtue."

Again it says:
"Virtue encompasses the unity of Dao.
When Dao and virtue are united, they blend as one.
When separated, they scatter as two.
Now, those who speak of the *Daode Jing* are correct.
Those who speak of the *Dao Jing* and the *De Jing* separately are not.

Later scholars, seeing the first chapter of the upper text and taking its words ‘Dao that can be spoken of,’ named it the *Dao Jing*.
Seeing the first chapter of the lower text and taking its words ‘the utmost virtue is not virtue,’ named it the *De Jing*.
Thus arises the division of Dao and virtue.

If the upper text speaks only of Dao, how then does it mention the fullness of virtue’s manifestation?
It follows Dao alone, yet Dao does not depart from virtue.
If the lower text speaks only of virtue, how then does it say ‘Dao gives birth, virtue nourishes’?
It is virtue that does not depart from Dao.

Examined through the text, Dao and virtue mutually depend upon each other and cannot be considered in isolation.
When one attempts to discuss this, Dao without virtue cannot be revealed, and virtue without Dao cannot be illuminated.
Dao is without action and without form, hence it precedes the transformation of all things.
Virtue has application and action, hence it follows after the generation and transformation of things.
Dao precedes, hence it is placed above.
Virtue follows, hence it is placed below.
Dao and virtue, when united, are one; they cannot be divided into two.

The *Xisheng Jing* states:
"Dao and virtue united is to be in harmony with the Dao."

The *Nanhua Jing* states:
"Form does not arise from Dao without generation.
Generation does not proceed from virtue without illumination.
Exhausting form and probing generation,
Establishing virtue and illuminating Dao."

From this, it is clear that Dao and virtue mutually depend upon each other and are not separate.

Master Sima Wen Gong summarized the essence, and the Grand Historian said:
"The Master Laozi wrote the upper and lower chapters, speaking of the meaning of Dao and virtue.
Later scholars, following the titles from the opening words of each chapter,
Named the upper chapter the *Dao Jing* and the lower chapter the *De Jing*.
Dao and virtue are inherently connected and cannot be considered in isolation.
Now we adhere to the original name.
The *Daode Jing*—the True Classic of Dao and Virtue—takes its entirety from the *Shan Ji* (卷十二)."
