**The Opening Explanation of the Dao De Jing**

The Master Laozi bore the surname Li (李氏), given name Er (耳), and courtesy name Boyang (伯阳). Because his ears were large and unrefined (漫无轮), he was thus nicknamed Dan (聃). He was a native of Ku County (苦县) in Chu (楚国).

He served the Zhou dynasty as the Keeper of the Archives (藏室史). During the reign of King Jing of Zhou (周景王), when Confucius was thirty years old, he once inquired about rites from Laozi when he was visiting. Their exchanges are frequently recorded in *The Book of Rites* (礼记). Confucius was of an earlier generation, and it is said: *"He merely transmits but does not create—he compares himself to me, to Laozi and Pengzu."* The Grand Historian Sima Qian also noted that Confucius revered Laozi, and this was not an exaggeration.

One hundred and twenty-nine years after Confucius’ passing, there was a Zhou court historian named Xian (檐), who once appeared before Duke Xian of Qin (秦献公) and spoke of the cycles of separation and union. Some claim that this Xian was Laozi, but this is incorrect. Xian (檐) and Laozi (老子) share the same pronunciation, and the error arose from transmission.

When the Zhou dynasty declined, Laozi traveled westward. As he approached the Sanmen Pass (散关), the Pass Warden, Yin Xi (尹喜), recognizing him as an extraordinary figure, insisted that he record his teachings. Laozi then composed the *Dao De Jing* in two sections, totaling over five thousand words, before departing.

Though these two sections contain chapters, they resemble the *Xici* (系辞) in structure—upper and lower parts. However, the Master of the Yellow River (河上公) divided it into eighty-one chapters, stating that the upper section follows Heaven (法天), whose number is odd, containing thirty-seven chapters; the lower section follows Earth (法地), whose number is even, containing forty-four chapters. Yan Zhen (严遵) further divided it into seventy-two, stating that eight chapters belong to the Yin (阴) Dao and nine to the Yang (阳) Dao, multiplying eight by nine to yield seventy-two. The upper section thus contains forty chapters, and the lower thirty-two. These divisions were not the original intent, nor were the chapter titles that followed.

During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong (元宗) revised the chapter divisions, assigning the upper section to the Dao (言道) and the lower to virtue (言德), which was also incorrect.

The transmitted editions vary greatly, and sometimes a single differing character alters the entire meaning of a chapter. Discerning the true intent becomes even more difficult.

In general, Laozi’s teachings use material things to elucidate the Dao, often adapting to the customs and inclinations of his time. Yet readers fail to grasp his intent, leading Master Hui (晦翁) to criticize Laozi as overly verbose, while Master Xi Shan (西山) accused him of harboring hidden agendas. Since this text is revered by Daoists, their excessive veneration leads to extravagant interpretations, failing to clarify its true meaning. Meanwhile, Confucian scholars dismiss it as heterodox, seizing upon flaws to condemn it without deeper examination. Though many commentaries exist, they all suffer from these shortcomings.

Only Master Yingbin (颖滨) has illuminated its meaning, coming close to the truth, yet his explanations of phrasing and textual flow remain incomplete, and many passages still pose difficulties. Moreover, he claims that Laozi’s work aligns with Buddhist scriptures, which is incorrect. Though Zhuangzi followed Laozi’s teachings, his words differ fundamentally from Laozi’s own. Zhuangzi’s *Autobiography* centers on life and death, as seen in *The Book of the World* (天下篇), which is why his ideas often converge with Buddhist thought. However, Laozi’s principles—such as *"acting without doing, thus transforming"* and *"not contending, yet achieving victory"*—do not contradict our own texts. Their differences stem only from his rhetorical exaggerations to correct societal excesses, occasionally going too far.

Master Yichuan (伊川) said: *"The chapter ‘Guishing’ (谷神) is Laozi’s finest."* Thus, Master Wending (文定) remarked: *"Laozi’s five thousand words are like his discussions on ‘I have no affairs,’ ‘I love tranquility,’ and ‘I possess the Three Treasures’—these are his most profound teachings."* Zhu Wen Gong (朱文公) also stated: *"Emperor Wen of Han and Cao Can only grasped the superficial aspects of Laozi’s teachings; Wang Dao and Xie An never reached their essence."* He further said: *"Bo Yi somewhat resembles Laozi."* And again: *"The people of Jin and Song often discuss Zhuangzi and Laozi, yet they fail to grasp their true depths."*

Thus, even the earlier scholars did not entirely reject Laozi, but because his teachings often used metaphorical language interpreted as literal truth, they were sometimes criticized. This has long been an unresolved debate. If one were to investigate and uncover his original intent, one would truly understand Laozi’s meaning—encountering it as if it were revealed in the morning and evening.

**Volume One of *The Oral Interpretation of the Dao De Jing***

**Volume One of *The Oral Interpretation of the Dao De Jing***
**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken"**

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.

Nameless, it marks the origin of Heaven and Earth;
Named, it is the mother of all things.

Ever without, to glimpse its subtlety;
Ever with, to perceive its manifestations.

These two—though issuing from the same source and bearing different names—are called the Mysterious.
The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious: the gateway through which all wonders emerge.

This chapter stands at the book’s beginning, its essence contained here.
Its meaning holds that the Dao cannot truly be spoken—any utterance becomes a secondary expression.
"Ever" signifies unchanging, immutable.

What can be spoken and named is subject to change;
What cannot be spoken or named is beyond change.

With names like *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (ritual), and *zhi* (wisdom), the benevolent cannot be righteous, the ritual cannot be wise.
With names like spring, summer, autumn, and winter, spring cannot be summer, autumn cannot be winter.
Thus, it is the *eternal Dao*, the *eternal Name*.

The origin of Heaven and Earth is the time before the *Taiji* (Supreme Polarity) divided;
In the human heart, it is the stillness, unmoving foundation.
Before the *Taiji* divided, how could there be names for spring, summer, autumn, and winter?
In stillness, unmoving, how could there be names for the seven virtues—*ren, yi, li, zhi*?
Thus, it is said: *Nameless, the origin of Heaven and Earth*.

When speaking of Heaven and Earth, it is not merely Heaven and Earth—
it is an analogy for the mind’s true nature.
Once names like *yin* and *yang* exist, all transformations arise from them;
Once names like *ren* and *yi* exist, all myriad paths begin here.
Thus, it is said: *Named, the mother of all things*.
"Mother" signifies the source from which all things arise.

The two lines—*Ever without* and *Ever with*—are Laozi’s teaching on ultimate understanding.
In the world, all things are *with*, yet who knows this *with* originates from *without*?
If one insists on *without*, one risks the reckless void, inviting calamity.
Thus, those who study the Dao must, in moments of *without*, seek its ultimate truth—
then perceive the wonder of how *with* arises.
And in moments of *with*, they must seek its ultimate truth—
then perceive its origin from *without*.
"Manifestations" (*jiao*)—as in the *Rites of Zhou*—refers to the source from which all things emerge.
The two "desire" (*yu*) words hold deep meaning: *desire* here means *seek* to attain this ultimate understanding.

Though *with* and *without* are two, though they bear different names, they share the same source.
If one constantly observes *without* and *with*, both are called the Mysterious—
the Mysterious being the marvel of transformation.
Thus viewed, Laozi’s teaching is not merely about empty nothingness.
If one were to insist solely on *without*, it would not say, *"These two issue from the same source,"*
nor *"Both are called the Mysterious."*
*The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious, the gateway of all wonders*—
this is the *Zhuangzi*’s *"There is a beginning, there is a non-beginning of beginning,
there is a non-beginning of the non-beginning of beginning."*
Yet it only praises its wonder—no other meaning exists.
To say one layer follows another is not its intent.
*All wonders*—as in the *Yijing*: *"The wondrous in all things."*
*Gateway*—speaking of their origin.
Many read this chapter only in terms of Heaven and Earth,
yet Laozi’s intent is to grasp it in the mind.
Only by viewing both together can one fully comprehend this book.

**Chapter Two: "Under Heaven All Know"**

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
then ugliness already exists.
When all know goodness as goodness,
then evil already exists.

Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,
difficulty and ease complete each other,
long and short define each other,
high and low depend on each other,
sound and voice harmonize,
before and after follow in sequence.

Therefore, the Sage acts without action,
teaches without speech.
All things arise, yet he does not claim them;
He nurtures, yet does not possess;
He acts, yet does not rely on it;
When his work is done, he does not dwell upon it.
Only because he does not dwell upon it does it not depart from him.

This chapter expounds the meaning of *having yet not dwelling*.
There is beauty, there is ugliness;
There is goodness, there is evil.
If one does not know beauty as beauty,
does not know goodness as goodness,
then there is no ugliness, no evil.

For all things under Heaven,
where there is *being*, there is *non-being*;
where there is *difficulty*, there is *ease*;
where there is *long*, there is *short*;
where there is *high*, there is *low*;
where there is *sound*, there is *voice*;
where there is *before*, there is *after*.
The six lines below—*give rise to, complete, define, depend, harmonize, follow*—
all illustrate the earlier meaning of beauty/ugliness and goodness/evil.

Thus, the Sage acts through *non-action*, speaks through *non-speech*—
not because he fears emptiness or busyness,
but because his work is done without dwelling upon it.
Like Heaven and Earth nurturing all things,
endlessly transforming without ceasing—
how could they claim the labor?
All things fill Heaven and Earth,
yet Heaven and Earth do not claim possession.
As for *being spring, being summer, giving life, taking life*—
how does transformation rely on these as its power?
Thus, it is said: *Nurtures yet does not possess; acts yet does not rely on it*.
Its intent lies solely in *when the work is done, not dwelling upon it*—
hence, *"All things arise, yet he does not claim them."*
The three lines elucidate this action,
as the *Yijing* says: *"Kun nurtures and completes all things."*
This is the meaning of Shun and Yu receiving the Mandate yet not claiming it.
All ancient Sages were thus—
how could Laozi alone be different?
Yet his words are too austere,
making them seem like heterodox teachings.

*"Only because he does not dwell upon it does it not depart from him"*—
those who possess *having* cannot truly have it,
while those who do not possess *having* can truly possess it.
These eight characters are profound.
The *Book of Documents* says: *"Having virtue, they lose their virtue."*
This is the very meaning.

The *Chapter on "Not Exalting the Virtuous"*:

*"When sound forms into harmonious patterns, it is called music—
hence, 'Music and sound harmonize together.'*

**Third Chapter: Not Exalting the Virtuous**
Not exalting the virtuous, so the people do not vie in contention;
Not treasuring rare and difficult goods, so the people do not turn to thievery;
Not displaying what is desirable, so the hearts do not grow disordered.
Thus, the Sage’s governance:
Empties their hearts, fills their bellies,
Weakens their ambitions, strengthens their bodies.
Ever keeps the people in ignorance and without desire—
so that even the wise dare not act.
If one acts with *non-action* (無為),
then there is nothing that cannot be governed.
*Exalting* is the same as *priding oneself*.

If I pride myself in virtue,
then contention will surely arise throughout the world.
Only Yu did not pride himself—
and thus none in the world could vie with his governance.
This is the very intent.

If I treasure rare goods,
then all will have hearts desiring to obtain them,
and their faults will lead to thievery.
These two lines elucidate the meaning of what follows—*not displaying what is desirable*.
If one does not show what is desirable,
then the heart will naturally settle.
*Not displaying what is desirable, so the hearts do not grow disordered*—
these eight characters are most excellent.

*Empties their hearts*: No thoughts of longing or admiration.
*Fills their bellies*: Sated with food.
*Weakens their ambitions*: No pursuit of competition.
*Strengthens their bodies*: Nourishes their vitality.
It speaks of the Sages of antiquity—
only ensuring the people were well-fed,
without other thoughts of longing or admiration,
their strength robust yet without striving for competition,
so their people remained pure and unspoiled,
knowing nothing, desiring nothing.
Though some among them had clever and contriving minds,
even if knowledge sprouted within their hearts,
they dared not act upon it.

Thus the Sage governs the world in this way—
and the Sage himself takes no pleasure in the world.
His governance is all through *non-action* (無為),
and thus there is nothing that cannot be governed.

*Not displaying what is desirable, so the hearts do not grow disordered*—
this describes how the Sage teaches his people.
*Teaching*: instructing the people.
Not exalting the virtuous, not treasuring rare goods—
all these are to prevent stirring the hearts of desire.
Stirring the hearts of desire does not stop at these two matters,
but they are spoken of for brevity.

Laozi lamented the turbulence of the latter ages,
so he contemplated the tranquility of antiquity.
His words are not without excess,
and thus they do not fully encompass our Sage’s teachings.

**Fourth Chapter: The Dao/Way is Boundless**
The Dao/Way is boundless yet applied—
sometimes it overflows, sometimes it does not.
Deep and vast, it seems like the origin of all things.
It blunts their sharpness,
dissolves their chaos,
harmonizes their brilliance,
unifies their dust,
and is profound—
seemingly as if it exists.
I do not know whose child it is,
yet it precedes the *Imperial Sovereign* (象帝之先).
*Boundless*: the same as *empty*.
Though the Dao/Way’s essence is empty,
its application is inexhaustible.
Sometimes full, sometimes not—
it adapts without fixed measure.
It does not say 'full or not full',
but 'sometimes it does not overflow',
for the word *sometimes* (或) reveals its meaning—
this is the art of composition.

*Deep*: beautiful.
*Seems*: employs a tentative phrase to praise it.
The origin of all things—
that is what Zhuangzi called the *Great Master of the Origin*.
It says this Dao/Way is like something that exists and does not exist—
only those who understand the Dao/Way know it,
so it is said to seem like the origin of all things.
*Blunts their sharpness*: it grinds them down, leaving no edges.
*Dissolves their chaos*: amid turmoil, it remains orderly and composed.
*Brilliance* yet not revealed—
hence, *harmonizes their brilliance*.
*Dust* yet not self-cleansing—
hence, *unifies their dust*.
This is what the Buddhist scriptures call *neither defiled nor pure*.
*Profound*: indistinct and invisible.
Seemingly existing, seemingly nonexistent—
visible yet invisible, knowable yet unknowable—
hence, *profound, it seems as if it exists*.
*I do not know whose child it is*—
also employs a tentative phrase to praise it.
*Imperial Sovereign*: the same as *Heaven*.
It says: *At the beginning of creation, it precedes the Sovereign*.
The phrases *seems* and *like* all describe
what is visible yet invisible,
knowable yet unknowable—
these words are used to depict its subtlety.

**Fifth Chapter: Heaven and Earth Lack Virtue/Ren** (天地不仁)

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Lack Virtue/Ren** (天地不仁)

They treat all things as *straw-dogs*;
The Sage lacks virtue/Ren, treating the people as *straw-dogs*.
Between Heaven and Earth—
Is it like a *wallet-bellows*?
Empty yet unyielding, moving yet ever more abundant.
Much speech leads to exhaustion—
Better to hold fast to the *Central Way*.
To nurture life is virtue/Ren—
Though Heaven and Earth nurture life, they do not claim it as merit,
Forgetting themselves in things.
To nourish the people is virtue/Ren—
Though the Sage nourishes the people, he does not claim it as grace,
Forgetting himself in the people.
*Not seven*—
This is because he lacks virtue/Ren.
*Straw-dog*—
Used and then discarded, an illustration of mutual forgetting.
Chapter Thirty-Eight says:
*The highest virtue lacks virtue*—
Thus it has virtue.
*Lacking virtue* is akin to *lacking virtue*.
*The Zhuangzi’s* *Qiwu* says:
*The greatest virtue is not virtue*.
*The Tian Di* says:
*In the age of perfect virtue*, they love one another yet do not call it virtue.
This too carries the same meaning.
The *straw-dog*—
When used in sacrifice, it is employed; once the sacrifice ends, it is cast aside.
This illustrates the idea of indifference and mutual forgetting.
In precise terms, it implies the intent of *transformation through excess*,
though some misinterpret it as treating the people like grass and chaff.
Generally, the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi
delight in shocking and defying conventional speech,
so their words often contain flaws.
The essence of this chapter is simply:
Heaven and Earth harbor no intention in nurturing life,
The Sage harbors no intention in nourishing the people.
Yet expressed in this way, it veers toward the strange,
and readers who lack precision fall into deep error.
Thus it is said:
The harshness of Shen Buhai and Han Fei
originates from the idea of treating the people as *straw-dogs*,
though even Laozi cannot evade blame.

*A wallet-bellows*—
The tube of the bellows; when used, wind arises.
Though its form is empty, its use is unyielding—
Move it, and wind emerges, ever more abundant.
Between Heaven and Earth, its nurturing of myriad things is thus.
The *wallet-bellows* does not harbor intent toward the wind—
Heaven and Earth do not harbor intent toward nurturing life—
Hence the analogy.
Moreover, when used, wind arises; when unused, it ceases—
This too carries the intent of *transformation through excess*.
*Much speech*—
Meaning repeated speech.
*Holding fast to the Central Way*—
Silently closing one’s mouth.
Meaning:
The Dao of Heaven and Earth cannot be exhausted by words—
Much speech leads to self-exhaustion;
Better to remain silent and forget speech.
The Master said:
*I wish to speak not at all—*
*What can Heaven say?*
The four seasons proceed therein,
And myriad things are born therein.
This too carries the same meaning.
But the Sage’s words are pure and easily understood,
While this text oscillates wildly, making it difficult to grasp.
Some may take it as a warning against excessive speech,
yet this contradicts the chapter’s intent.
If one sees through this,
Not only does the beginning and end cohere within a single chapter,
with clear meaning,
But its language is concise, profound, and anciently elegant—
How could this be easily attained?

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die** (谷神不死)

The *Valley Spirit* does not die—
This is called the *Dark Feminine*.
The *Dark Feminine’s Gate*—
This is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth*.
Endless, as if it exists,
Used without exhaustion.
This chapter describes the practice of cultivation,
though Laozi’s original intent was not solely for cultivation.
*Essence* is solid, *Spirit* is empty.
*Valley*—emptiness.
*The Valley Spirit*—the spirit within emptiness.
Saying that the human spirit arises from emptiness,
Thus it constantly exists and does not die—
Mysterious and boundless.
*Feminine*—empty yet not solid.
These two characters merely describe *emptiness*.
Heaven and Earth also arise from this,
Hence called *Root*.
*Endless*—unceasing and unbroken.
*As if it exists*—
Neither clearly present nor absent.
Used within emptiness, thus not labored yet ever-present—
This is the *empty yet unyielding, moving yet ever more abundant*.
Master Hui said:
*The most subtle principle*
Holds the intent of *generative generation*.
This phrase is fine,
But its meaning leans toward theories of life-nurturing.
Though this chapter can be applied to life-nurturing,
Its original intent was not solely focused on this.

---

**Chapter Seven: Heaven Long, Earth Durable** (天长地久)

Heaven is long, Earth is durable.
Heaven and Earth endure long because
They do not will their own generation,
Thus they endure in generation.
Therefore, the Sage places his body last yet it is first,
Sets it aside yet it is preserved.
Is this not because he is without selfishness?
Thus he fulfills his selfishness.
This chapter uses Heaven and Earth to illustrate the Sage’s lack of intent.
Heaven and Earth nurture myriad things naturally,
Without intent, thus enduring for ten thousand years as if but a day.
The Sage’s cultivation of his body
Lacks intent toward precedence or subsequence,
Lacks intent toward interior or exterior,
Thus nothing precedes him yet he constantly exists—
Therefore, his lack of selfishness fulfills his selfishness.
This *selfishness* refers to the body,
Not the selfishness of public and private.
If *selfishness* is taken as public-private selfishness,
Then it cannot be said he lacks intent.
This phrase is also Laozi’s way of enticing people toward goodness,
And the Buddhist later inverted it with phrases like *true emptiness, true existence*.
Thus *true emptiness* is the meaning of *lacking selfishness*,
*True existence* is the meaning of *fulfilling selfishness*.
But when spoken of, it seems yet another layer higher.

**Chapter Eight: The Highest Goodness Is Like Water** (上善若水)

The highest goodness is like water.
Water benefits myriad things yet does not contend,
Dwells where people dislike—
Thus it approaches the Dao.
Residing in goodness of place,
Heart in goodness of depth,
Speech in goodness of kindness,
Affairs in goodness of ability,
Actions in goodness of timing.
Only because it does not contend,
Thus it has no blame.
This chapter again uses water to illustrate the lack of intent.
*Highest goodness*—the utmost goodness,
Saying that the supreme principle of the world aligns with water.
Water’s goodness—
It benefits myriad things,
Yet never considers itself capable.

**Chapter Eight: The Highest Goodness Is Like Water (续)**
Flowing without resistance—this is non-contention.
Descending to lowliness, embracing dampness,
It does not take what others abhor as abhorrent.
Thus, observing water, one draws near the Dao.
*"Near"* means *close*.

Residing in goodness of place—dwelling there with ease.
Heart in goodness of depth—its steadfastness and stillness.
With others in goodness of kindness—its benevolence extending to all.
Speech in goodness of truth—its words ever aligned with reality.
Governance in goodness of order—by it, the state is rectified.
Affairs in goodness of ability—by it, no task remains unattended.
Actions in goodness of timing—moving with perfect season.
Only because it does not contend,
Thus none can blame it.

This is why it is said:
*"Only because you do not contend,
No one under heaven can contend with you."*

Many interpreters mistakenly take these seven virtues as water’s highest goodness,
Thus their explanations are forced and stray from Laozi’s true intent.

---

**Chapter Nine: Holding Fullness (持而盈之)**
Holding fullness to the brim,
It fares worse than if it had not been filled.
Sharpening to a point,
It cannot endure long.
Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can guard them.
Rich and noble yet arrogant,
They invite their own calamity.
When deed is complete, name secured,
Withdraw—this is the Way of Heaven.

This chapter speaks only of retreat being better than advancement,
Using the metaphors of holding fullness and sharpening to a point.
What is full must overflow—difficult to hold.
Better to avoid fullness than to struggle with it.
*"Already"* means *"do not fill."*

*"Describe"* means *"refine."* *"Sharp"* means *"keen."*
Refining a vessel to its utmost sharpness and keenness,
Nothing endures—better to remain unsharpened for lasting preservation.
Wealth reaching gold and jade in halls,
Cannot be long retained.
Ascending to noble rank yet growing arrogant,
They bring ruin upon themselves.
Thus those who preserve their merit and safeguard their name
Must know when to withdraw early—
This is the Way of Heaven.

*"Deed complete, name secured"*—
This refers to those who, by greatness or smallness,
Can preserve themselves—hence *"complete"* and *"secured."*
If one does not know sufficiency,
When is it ever complete?
When is it ever secured?
These four characters must be pondered carefully.

---

**Chapter Ten: Carrying the Vital Essence (载营魄)**
Can you carry the vital essence and yet remain undivided?
Can you focus your qi and attain supreme softness,
Like an infant?
Can you purify and observe the profound,
Yet remain without flaw?
Can you govern the people and the state,
Yet act without doing?
Can you open and close the celestial gates,
Yet remain without distinction?
Can you be clear and all-encompassing,
Yet remain without knowing?

To nurture and rear—
To give birth yet not possess,
To act yet not rely,
To grow yet not dominate—
This is called *profound virtue*.

*"Vital essence"*—the soul, the spirit.
*"Arcane"*—the essence, the qi.
These three characters hold Laozi’s deepest meaning.
*"Carrying"* is like loading a vehicle—
Placing *"vital essence"* above while positioning *"arcane"* below,
Like a riddle.

If the arcane carries the vital essence, it is the way of the common.
If the vital essence carries the arcane, it is the way of the sage.
Together, they form one;
Separated, they are two.
*"Embrace"* means *"unify."*
Its intent is: Can you unify and make one, so as not to divide?
Or will you separate and make two?
Thus it asks: *"Can you embrace unity and remain undivided?"*
These six characters hold profound, hidden meaning—
Only self-reflection and enlightenment can reveal them.

An infant, untainted by perception or hearing,
Thus its qi is focused.
*"Attain"* means *"push to the utmost."*
*"Softness"* means *"yielding."*
If one can, like an infant, focus the qi and embrace yielding,
Then one can embrace unity—
Thus it asks: *"Can you be like an infant?"*
These are Laozi’s rhetorical questions,
Meaning: *"Can people truly do this?"*
The following questions follow the same intent.

To purify and observe the profound mysteries,
Yet remain without distinction—
*"Without flaw"* means *"without differentiation."*
Though impurities are cleansed, if the mind still clings to purity and defilement,
Then one can embrace unity.
To love the people and govern the state,
Yet act with a *"doing without doing"* heart—
Then one can embrace unity.
The opening and closing of yin and yang,
Though governed by the interplay of male and female,
If the mind does not cling to such distinctions—
Then one can embrace unity.
*"Celestial gates"*—the natural principles between heaven and earth.
This is also a metaphor borrowed from creation.
From such language, the cultivation schools arose,
And some have perverted it, misleading many.

*"Clear and all-encompassing"*—without obstruction.
Yet to regard *"without knowing"* as knowing—
This is to embrace unity.
*"To nurture and rear"*—the creative process of nature nurturing all things.
Creation does not regard them as its own,
Does not rely on them as its power.
Though it is the sovereign of all things,
It never harbors a will to dominate—
Only then is it called *profound virtue*.

This chapter’s intent is largely about *"doing without doing,"*
Acting naturally.
If one acts without doing, the heart remains empty—
Thus the spirit carries the arcane, not the arcane the spirit.
This is the way of the sage.
If the arcane carries the spirit, it becomes entangled.

Laozi’s entire work revolves around:
*"Being real yet empty, having yet without—*
This is the ultimate Way."
Whether spoken directly or obliquely,
It never strays from this principle.

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes (三十辐章)**

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes (三十辐章)**
---

The thirty spokes converge at a single hub,
Yet it is their emptiness that makes the carriage useful.
Mold clay into a vessel,
Yet it is their emptiness that makes the vessel useful.
Pierce doors and windows to make a dwelling,
Yet it is their emptiness that makes the dwelling useful.
Thus, *having* provides utility,
But *emptiness* provides function.

The hub is the axle’s core within the carriage,
The spokes’ foundation.
Because the hub is hollow within,
Only then can it bear the carriage.

Clay and mud—tools of the potter—
Are hollow and round,
Thus they can form vessels.

Doors and windows are the dwelling’s luminous passages.
These three things—
All use *emptiness* as their function,
Hence: *having* yields utility,
*emptiness* yields use.

Carriage, vessel, dwelling—
All are tangible utilities,
Yet their essence as carriage, dwelling, or vessel
All depend on the hollow’s function.

With this, the single character *wu* (無) is rendered in vivid form—
A stroke of genius.

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors (五色章)**
---

The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deafen the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate,
Excessive hunting and chasing madden the mind,
Rare treasures corrupt conduct.
Thus the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes,
And discards the former to embrace the latter.

*Blindness*—the power to confuse vision.
*Deafness*—the power to confuse hearing.
*Dullness*—loss of true taste.
*Madness*—instability of mind.
*Corruption*—obstruction of virtue.

These five things
All stem from indulging externals while neglecting the inner self.
The belly is within,
The eyes are without.
The sage attends to the inner, not the outer,
Thus discards the former and embraces the latter.

*Former*—the five excesses above.
*Latter*—the Dao.

Laozi’s chapters often conclude with piercing precision.
*Indulging externals* is not limited to these five—
A general principle for all to infer.

**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation (宠辱章)**
---

Honor and humiliation—like sudden shocks,
Treating great calamity as one’s own body.

What is meant by *honor and humiliation*?
Honor is lowly—
Gaining it causes alarm,
Losing it causes alarm.

What is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?
The reason I have great calamity
Is that I have a body.
If I had no body,
What calamity would I have?

Thus, to value the body as the world,
One may entrust oneself to the world;
To love the body as the world,
One may commit oneself to the world.

*If*—though—
Honor and humiliation are not worth alarm,
Yet people alarm themselves.
The body is a great calamity,
Yet people value it.

First, two phrases are raised,
Then explained below.

*What is meant*—
Not worth speaking of.

**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation (宠辱章)**
Honor and humiliation are one and the same,
A matter that, in truth, is not worth speaking of.
Yet people regard humiliation as lowly,
And thus their hearts of good and evil arise.
Therefore, both gaining and losing it
Can agitate their minds—
This is the meaning of *fearing gain and loss*.

The body is my burden,
Without it, there would be no burden at all.
Yet people mistakenly value it,
For they do not know its true nature.

To know the true worth of the body,
To love the body as the world’s treasure,
Even if one gains all under heaven,
It is not enough to exchange for it.

If people could grasp this,
They might entrust themselves to the world.

The words *entrust* and *commit* imply
That the world would not accept them.
This chapter’s two *What is meant* queries
Hold two distinct meanings—
A subtle beauty of the ancient text.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Dao Beyond Form (视之不见章)**
That which cannot be seen is called *Yi*,
That which cannot be heard is called *Xi*,
That which cannot be grasped is called *Wei*.
These three cannot be summoned or questioned,
So they are merged into one.

Its upper reaches are not bright,
Its lower depths are not dark.
Endless, yet without name,
It returns to the formless void.
This is called the *form of no-form*,
The *image of no-image*—
This is *Hunhuang*.

Approach it and you see no head,
Follow it and you see no tail.
Hold fast to the ancient Dao,
To govern the present with the eternal.
To know the ancient beginning,
This is called *Dao Ji*.

This chapter describes the Dao’s lack of trace.
*Yi* means *level/even*.
*Xi* and *Wei* convey the idea of *invisibility*.
Initially, the three terms are indistinct,
All depicting the Dao’s unseen, unheard, ungraspable nature.
*Bó* means *to hold*.
The three—*Xi, Yi, Wei*—
Their names cannot be summoned or questioned,
For they are beyond distinction.
Thus, they are merged into one,
For they are all the Dao.

These two lines are Laozi’s own explanation of the three above,
Where Laozi says *cannot be summoned or questioned*,
Yet the commentator still distinguishes *Xi, Yi, Wei*.
Following his reasoning, though constrained,
The flow of his words remains unbroken.

*Not bright* means *not clear*,
*Not dark* means *not obscure*.
*Upper* and *lower* refer to *looking up and down*.
These two words should not be rigidly confined,
But simply convey that this Dao
Is neither clear nor obscure,
Whether sought above or below.

*Endless, yet without name*—
Its conclusion returns to nothingness,
Thus it is the *form of no-form*,
The *image of no-image*—
This is also *Hunhuang*.

To approach it and see no head,
Is to say it has no beginning.
To follow it and see no tail,
Is to say it has no end.

*Hold fast to the ancient Dao*—
Its origin was void, yet emerged from it.
By knowing its initial void,
One may govern the present with the eternal,
And thus grasp the ancient Dao’s essence.

*Ji* means *principle/standard*.
*Dao Ji* is like saying *human principle*
Or the *standard of the sovereign’s Way*.
This chapter portrays the ancient sage’s mastery.

---

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage’s Virtue (古之善为士章)**
The ancient sage who mastered the Way
Was subtle, mysterious, and profound—
Too deep to be known.

Since it cannot be known,
He feigned outward forms to describe it:
*Yu* like one crossing a river in winter,
*Jū* like one fearing four neighbors,
*Yǎn* like a guest,
*Huàn* like ice about to melt,
*Dūn* like uncarved wood,
*Kuàng* like an empty valley,
*Hún* like muddy water.

Who can make muddy water still,
And slowly it becomes clear?
Who can remain motionless for long,
And slowly life emerges?

He who preserves this Dao
Does not seek fullness.
Because he does not seek fullness,
He can endure decay without renewal.

This chapter depicts one attuned to the Dao’s subtlety,
Deep in its understanding,
Yet without revealing what he knows.

His outward appearance comes from *wu xin*—
A void so profound that knowledge cannot grasp it,
Thus his forms seem effortless.
*Yu* like one crossing a river in winter—
The difficulty of traversing.
*Yu* also means *leisurely*, *hesitant*.
*Jū* means *hesitant*, *like one fearing four neighbors*,
Who dares not act freely.
*Guest* implies *lack of freedom*.
*Yǎn* means *serene and composed*.
*Huàn* means *relaxed and dispersing*—
Like ice on the verge of thawing,
Seemingly scattered yet still bound.

*Dūn* means *thick/dense*.
*Uncarved wood* conveys *wholeness*.
*Kuàng* means *open/expansive*.
*Valley* means *void*.
*Muddy water*—
When left undisturbed, it grows clear;
When stirred, it remains muddy.
Within the muddy, if held still,
Slowly it clears itself.
*Motionless for long*—
If left undisturbed, it moves gently,
Thus it *slowly generates*.

*Who can*—
Asking who can achieve such balance.
*Slowly*—
Means *with ease*, *gradually*.

These two lines simply mean
That clarity and stillness coexist,
Motion and rest intertwine—
Clear within the muddy, still within the moving.

*Does not seek fullness*—
This is *emptiness*.
*Decay*—
Means *old/used*.
He who preserves this Dao
Is always empty within,
Thus he only sees the old,
Not the new—
This is the Way of the first chapter.

To endure decay without renewal,
Is to remain unchanged for a thousand years.

Only then can one achieve true mastery of the Dao.
Thus, *to endure decay without renewal* is one phrase,
*Mastery* is another.

「Penetrating stillness is steadfastness.
To attain emptiness and stillness,
Then to witness the myriad things in their generation,
And observe their return to their roots—
This is the Way.

*Generation* is *birth*.
*Return* is the time when they revert to their roots and restore their vital essence.
This is the essence of *constancy*—
To observe its subtlety without craving,
To perceive its openings with natural desire.
*Keynote* (芸芸) is like *flourishing* (纷纷).

Though things flourish in abundance,
Their end is to return to their roots.
Once they return to their roots,
This is the time when motion reaches its extreme and stillness ensues—
This is the natural principle,
Wherefrom the restoration of vital essence begins,
Hence it is called *restoration of vital essence* (复命).
To attain the state of restored vital essence,
Is to be constant and enduring without change.

He who knows the constant and enduring Dao,
Only then is he called *enlightened* (明).
This is the meaning of:
*The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao*,
*The name that can be named is not the constant name*.

Men alone fail to recognize this constant Dao,
Thus they harbor reckless thoughts and reckless actions—
All these are the calamities of straying from the Dao.

To know constancy,
Then one’s heart aligns with the vastness of Heaven and Earth—
What cannot it embrace?
Once able to embrace,
Then what matter cannot it govern justly?
He who rules the world,
Is he who embodies this just Dao.

To rule by this just Dao,
Is to harmonize with Heaven—
Heaven is the Dao itself,
Thus it is said: *ruling is Heaven*,
*Heaven is the Dao*.

*Enduring* is *constancy*.
If one attains this constant Dao,
Then throughout one’s life there is nothing outside the Dao—
How could one perish?
This applies to all, from the Son of Heaven down to the common folk.

This is the meaning of the *Supreme Ultimate* chapter, the seventeenth.

「The Supreme Dao, the people below merely know of its existence;
The next best thing, they cherish and praise it;
The next, they fear it;
The next, they scorn it;
Thus, trust is insufficient, and there arises distrust.
*Ah, how they value words!*

When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
The common folk all say, *"This is how things naturally are."*
*The Supreme Dao* refers to the age of antiquity.
*Below*, it means the realm of all under Heaven.
In the ancient times, the people of all under Heaven only knew of the sovereign’s existence,
Yet all forgot themselves within the transformations of the Dao.

Later, the people began to feel affection and praise toward the sovereign.
Again later, they began to feel fear and awe.
Again later, they began to scorn and mock.
This shows that the Way of the world declines ever downward.
When the virtue/power of the Supreme Dao wanes,
The principle of sincerity grows insufficient,
Thus the people of all under Heaven begin to harbor distrust.
This is the meaning of the *merchants’ oaths* marking the start of rebellion,
And the *gathering of the people* under the Zhou leading to suspicion.
Once the people doubt,
Yet those in governance still complacently value words,
Thus there arise proclamations, teachings, and edicts—
Does this not further deepen the people’s suspicions?
*Ah, how they value words!*—
This is the meaning of *complacency*.

In the age of the Supreme Dao,
Deeds were already accomplished,
Affairs already fulfilled,
And the people of all under Heaven silently received their blessings,
Yet did not know whence they came,
All saying, *"This is how things naturally are."*
This is what is meant by: *The imperial virtue/power is upon me—what has it to do with me?*

Since it is said that valuing words is wrong,
Yet this single phrase concludes it,
This is a lament for the present while reflecting upon the past.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**

When the Great Dao declines, there arise benevolence and righteousness;
When wisdom and cleverness emerge, there arises great deceit;
When the Six Relationships are discordant, there arise filial piety and kindness;
When the state is in chaos, there arise loyal ministers.

When the Great Dao prevails, benevolence and righteousness are inherent within it.
Once the names of benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao grows faint.
Thus it is said: *When the Great Dao declines, there arise benevolence and righteousness.*
As if the sun of wisdom and cleverness rises,
And then deceit and falsehood flourish throughout the world.
When the Six Relationships are discordant,
Then the names of filial piety and kindness arise.
In times when the state is in chaos,
Then the names of loyal ministers arise.
These three sentences are all parables,
Illustrating the meaning of the preceding sentence.

**Chapter Nineteen: Reject Learning and Worry Ceases**

To reject learning and abandon wisdom, the people benefit a hundredfold;
To reject benevolence and abandon righteousness, the people return to filial piety and kindness;
To reject cleverness and abandon profit, thieves and robbers vanish.
These three are considered insufficient in terms of culture,
Thus there arise their corresponding institutions.
*Seeing simplicity and embracing purity,*
*Few private concerns and little desire.*

Once the names of learning and wisdom emerge,
Then the calamities of the world arise—
Better to reject and abandon them,
And the people will naturally benefit.
Once the names of benevolence and righteousness arise,
Then distinctions between filial and unfilial,
Kind and unkind, begin to emerge—
Better to reject and discard them,
And let the people forget the Dao,
Then all will return to the midst of filial piety and kindness,
Without any need for distinctions.

When cleverness and profit are valued,
Then thieves and robbers will arise—
Better to reject and abandon them,
This is what is meant by: *Do not esteem difficult-to-obtain goods,*
*So that the people will not become thieves.*

Learning and wisdom, benevolence and righteousness,
Cleverness and profit—
These three are all the Way of the world
Growing ever more refined and cultural,
Thus their names arise.
From the perspective of one who knows the Dao,
This refinement is not beneficial for governing the world—
Better to entrust the people,
And let them see simplicity and embrace purity,
Few private concerns and little desire,
Then the world will naturally have no troubles.

*Order* means *to make*;
*Entrust* is akin to the reading of *属民* in the *Rites of Zhou*.
This meaning is to say:
The more advanced the cultural governance,
The thinner the Way of the world becomes—
Better to return to simplicity and purity,
As in the age of antiquity.
This is also a speech of one’s time, filled with frustration at the world’s state.

**Chapter Twenty: Reject Learning, Worry Ceases**

**Chapter Twenty: Reject Learning, Worry Ceases**

*"Yes" and "Ah"*—how far apart are they?
*"Good"* and *"evil"*—how distant are they?

What people fear, I dare not fail to fear.
Oh, the chaos—its endlessness!

The multitude bustles, feasting as on a grand sacrifice,
Ascending spring platforms with joy.
Yet I alone remain still, unformed—
Like an infant yet to stir,
Drifting, drifting, as if nowhere bound.

The multitude all have excess;
I alone seem abandoned.
Ah, my foolish heart—so muddled!

The common man is bright and clear;
I alone seem dim.
The common man is sharp and keen;
I alone am dull and clouded.

Serene as the sea, yet restless as the wind,
Endless, with no place to rest.

The multitude all have their schemes;
I alone am stubborn and crude.
I differ from others—
Yet I prize savoring the Mother.

To practice the Dao is daily subtraction;
To study is daily addition.
These words must not be confused with Confucian texts—
For learning only distances one from the Dao.

Reject learning and return to the Uncarved,
Then there will be no worry.

*"Yes"* and *"Ah"* are both affirmations.
Men who study take *"good"* over *"evil"*—
Just as one might say *"Yes"* triumphs over *"Ah"*—
Yet it is better to discard even the name of *"good."*

This is the meaning: *"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty,
Then ugliness arises."*

Yet even the ancients who knew the Dao,
Though they deemed both *"good"* and *"evil"* unworthy,
Still had things they feared.
Whatever people fear, I have never failed to fear.

If I were to treat all fears as unworthy,
Then where would the chaos end?

Chaos—this is disorder.
Endless—without limit.

The Chan school speaks of sudden awakening,
Breaking through cause and effect—
This is the fear people have yet do not fear.

Wild and unrestrained, inviting calamity—
This is the *"Oh, the chaos—its endlessness!"*

The multitude delights in worldly flavors,
Feasting as on a grand sacrifice,
Ascending spring platforms—
Yet I alone take joy in simplicity,
No thoughts taking form,
Like an infant yet to stir,
Drifting, drifting, as if nowhere bound.

*Unformed*—this means no stirrings, no movement.
Thus, *"unformed."*

*Infant*—just born.
*Child*—slightly grown.
The heart of an infant knows nothing at all.

*Drifting, drifting*—as if motionless.
*Nowhere bound*—untouched by traces.

This is how I differ from the multitude—
They all seek gain and excess,
While I alone seem abandoned.
Am I truly foolish, so muddled?

*Muddled*—utterly confused, without knowledge.
This means I take no pleasure in excess,
Nor do I harbor thoughts of surplus—
Not because I am foolish, but because you are wise.

*Dim and clouded*—this is the same as *muddled.*
The common man is bright and sharp,
While I alone am dim and clouded—
This is how I differ.

My heart is serene, like a boat on the great sea,
The wind howling without rest—
This is the meaning of *drifting, drifting, as if nowhere bound.*

*Have schemes*—to act with purpose.
The multitude all act with purpose,
While I take joy in seeking nothing—
Thus I seem stubborn and crude.
Am I truly crude?

I differ from others only in savoring the Dao.

The Mother of ten thousand things—
*Mother*—this is the Dao.
*Food*—this is *savoring.*
To prize savoring the Mother—
This means to value tasting the Dao.

「The Chapter on the Appearance of Great Virtue (Chapter 21)
The appearance of great virtue follows only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing—
Only vague, only indistinct.
Indistinct yet vague—
Within it lies an *image* (xiàng).
Vague yet indistinct—
Its *weaving* (zhī) contains *things* (wù).
Deep and dark—
Within it lies *essence* (jīng).
Its essence is most true,
Within it lies *faith* (xìn).
From ancient times to the present,
Its name does not fade,
For it encompasses all *beauties* (méi).
How do I know all beauties are thus?
Because of this.
*孔* (Kǒng), means *abundant* (shèng).
Those who understand the Dao,
Follow only the Dao,
Yet what they manifest outwardly—
They possess the appearance of abundant virtue.
*德* (Virtue) as a word means *obtain* (dé).
To obtain it from oneself is virtue.
The Dao is unseen, yet virtue is seen,
Thus virtue is called the appearance of the Dao.

Mencius said: *"When one’s movements and demeanor are measured and harmonious, that is the utmost of virtue."*
This sentence differs slightly.
But those who read Zhuangzi and Laozi,
Should observe them through the lens of their own words—
If one seeks to reconcile them with Confucius and Mencius,
Then the language becomes too constrained.

Only vague, only indistinct—
This speaks of the Dao’s unseen nature.
Though unseen, it is not without substance,
Thus it is said: *Within it lies an image,*
*Within it lies things,*
*Within it lies essence.*
This is the meaning of *true emptiness and then real existence.*

Its essence is most true,
Within it lies faith—
These two sentences reveal that within the void,
There is truly substance,
And this cannot be dismissed as empty words.
*信* (Faith) means *reality* (shí).

The Dao’s name persists through antiquity and modernity,
Never vanishing for a single day,
And all good things arise from it.
*众美* (All beauties) are the myriad virtues.
*历阅* (Encompassing) means to traverse and witness.
All good things come and go,
All from this Dao.
*以此者* (Because of this) means *because of the Dao.*
I know that all beauties originate thus—
It is because of this Dao alone.
This kind of concluding phrase
Is also the refined essence of the text.

**The Chapter on Flexibility and Fullness (Chapter 22)**
When *flexible* (qū), one is *whole* (quán);
When *crooked* (wǎng), one is *straight* (zhí);
When *hollowed* (wā), one is *filled* (yíng);
When *worn* (bì), one is *renewed* (xīn);
When *few* (shǎo), one *gains* (dé);
When *many* (duō), one is *bewildered* (huò).
Thus the Sage holds *oneness* (yī) as the model for all under heaven.
Not self-displaying, hence *bright* (míng);
Not self-asserting, hence *illustrious* (zhāng);
Not self-praising, hence *accomplished* (gōng);
Not self-exalting, hence *enduring* (cháng).

Only by not contending,
Is the Sage unmatched by all under heaven in contention.

The ancients spoke of *flexibility leading to fullness*—
Was this empty talk?
Indeed, it is fullness and return.

To be flexible and then whole,
To be crooked and then straight,
To be hollowed and then filled,
To be worn and then renewed—
To be few and then many—
All speak of the meaning:
*To be insufficient and then have abundance,*
*To be truly empty and then real existence.*

*Few yet gain, many yet bewildered*—
This is merely the phrase *few, many* (shǎo duō),
Further refined into two sentences.

*One* (yī) is the *void* (xū),
The *unseen* (wú),
The *insufficient* (bùzú).
The Sage holds only this principle of *oneness*,
Thus it becomes the standard for all under heaven.

Not self-displaying,
Not self-asserting,
Not self-praising,
Not self-exalting—
All mean *not claiming what one has.*

I, with an empty heart,
Contend with nothing under heaven—
Then what is there to contend?

*Enduring* (cháng) means *long-lasting* (kě jiǔ).
Having said this,
Yet it brings back the earlier phrase *flexibility leading to fullness*,
To conclude thus—
This is also a marvel of the text.

Heaven and Earth, with me,
Have no lack or defect—
I but return to fullness,
And what else is there to do?

*诚* (Indeed) means *reality* (shí).
The four sentences on *flexibility, crookedness, hollowness, and wear*
Are all parables,
To reveal the meaning below.

**The Chapter on Sparse Speech and Naturalness (Chapter 23)**
*Sparse speech* (xī yán) is *naturalness* (zìrán).*」

---

Thus, gusts of wind do not last the morning,
And sudden rains do not last the day.
Who does this?
Heaven and Earth.

Even Heaven and Earth cannot endure—
How much less can mortals?

Therefore, those who follow the Dao:
Those aligned with the Dao are one with the Dao,
Those aligned with virtue are one with virtue,
Those aligned with loss are one with loss.

Those one with the Dao—
The Dao delights in them;
Those one with virtue—
Virtue delights in them;
Those one with loss—
Loss delights in them.

Faith insufficient, there is doubt.
Between Heaven and Earth,
Only the two words *natural* and *sparse*
Can exhaust the principle of Heaven and Earth.

*Sparse*—few.
These two words, though few in speech,
Yet the principle of Heaven and Earth is no more than this.

Though gusts and sudden rains are wrought by Heaven and Earth,
They do not last the morning, nor the day—
How can human gain and ruin, rise and fall,
Be constant?

Those who follow the Dao—
They who study the Way.
The Way—action.
Virtue—attainment.
What may be acted upon, I act upon—
I do not resist.
What may be attained, I attain—
I do not resist.
What may be lost, I lose—
I do not resist.

*One*—to follow in harmony without resistance.
What may be acted upon, I delight in attaining;
What may be attained, I delight in attaining;
What may be decided—whether gain or loss—I delight in it all—
This is why they are called *knowers of the Dao*.

Yet this requires sufficient faith.
If faith is lacking where it should be,
Then one cannot fully trust oneself.

Thus it is said:
*Faith insufficient, there is doubt.*

**The Chapter on the Unsteady Not Standing (Chapter 24)**
The unsteady does not stand,
The straddling cannot walk.
The self-revealing are blind,
The self-righteous are unilluminated,
The self-praising achieve nothing,
The self-exalting do not endure.

In the Dao, they are called *excess food, superfluous limbs*.
Things naturally abhor them,
Thus the Daoist does not dwell upon them.

*Unsteady*—feet not touching the ground.
Standing on tiptoe, one cannot endure.
*Straddling*—thighs not touching.
Straddling, one cannot walk.
These two sentences are metaphors.

Self-revealing, self-righteous, self-praising, self-exalting—
All are those who claim what they have and do not transform.
*Unilluminated*—self-obscured.
*Unilluminated*—name not displayed.
*Not enduring*—cannot last long.

The *Yijing* says:
*"Fullness cannot endure long."*
This is the same meaning.

*Excess food, superfluous limbs*—
All are burdens.
The Daoist makes no progress;
Progress is a burden.
*Says excess, says superfluous*—
In the manner of Zhuangzi’s *conjoined toes, branched fingers*.
Food’s excess is discarded,
Form’s superfluity is a blemish—
Mankind naturally abhors them,
Thus the Daoist does not dwell upon them,
Saying: *Do not burden oneself with traces.*

**The Chapter on the Indiscernible Mixture (Chapter 25)**
There is a thing, mixed and complete,
Born before Heaven and Earth,
Silent and vast,
Standing alone yet unchanging,
Circulating yet without peril,
It can be the Mother of all under Heaven.

I do not know its name—
I call it the Dao.
Forcibly naming it, I say: *Great*.
*Great* says: *Passing*,
*Passing* says: *Distant*,
*Distant* says: *Returning*.

Thus, the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The Sage is great.
Within the realm, there are four *Greats*—
And the Sage occupies one.

One follows Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows Naturalness.

*There is a thing, mixed and complete*—
The Dao.
The *Unexcelled* and the *Supreme Polarity*.
Its birth precedes Heaven and Earth—
Saying Heaven and Earth arise from it.
*Silent and vast*—
Invisible.
*Standing alone yet unchanging*—
Enduring yet unaltered.
*Circulating yet without peril*—
Vigorous yet unceasing.
*It can be the Mother of all under Heaven*—
The source from which all things arise.

I do not know its name—
It cannot be named.
Since it cannot be named,
I call it the Dao.
*Call*—a substitute term.

*Says the Dao*—
Yet the Dao is insufficient to exhaust it,
So I forcibly name it *Great*.
*Great*—
Yet *Great* is insufficient to exhaust it,
So I name it *Passing*.
*Passing*—
Going, yet cannot be pursued.
*Passing*—
Yet *Passing* is insufficient to exhaust it,
So I forcibly name it *Distant*.
*Distant*—
Cannot be approached, cannot be clung to.
*Distant*—
Yet *Distant* is insufficient to exhaust it,
So I forcibly name it *Returning*.
*Returning*—
The meaning of returning to the root.

These are rhetorical flourishes—
In *Zhuangzi*, such abound.
Some mistakenly take *Returning* as *seeking within oneself*—
This is wrong.

*Within the realm, there are four Greats*—
The Sage dwells in one.
It means: though mankind resides between Heaven and Earth,
They know only the Sage as great,
Yet above the Sage, there are three greater still.

Yet one follows Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows Naturalness—
Thus, Naturalness is greater than the Dao, Heaven, and Earth.

Its intent is but to say:
The Dao reaches its extreme in Naturalness—
Such is the marvelous argument.

**The Chapter on the Heavy as Light’s Root (Chapter 26)**
The heavy is the root of the light,
The still is the lord of the restless.

Thus the sage always says:
*"Action does not depart from the baggage train."*
Though there be splendid palaces,
He dwells aloof and serene.

How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
Make his body light for all under Heaven?
Lightness brings loss of ministers,
Restlessness brings loss of the self.

There is heavy, there is light,
There is still, there is restless.
*Root*—
Saying lightness arises from heaviness.
*Lord*—
Saying stillness governs restlessness.

The Daoist, throughout the day,
Walks without clinging to baggage—
Saying: without heaviness, there is no lightness;
Without stillness, there is no restlessness.

*Depart*—
To adhere.
His mind’s vision reaches the utmost beauty of all under Heaven—
Thus *splendid palaces*.
Though such palaces exist,
He dwells in them with ease—
Thus, he stands aloof beyond lightness, heaviness, stillness, and restlessness.

「燕，安也。
*Yan* is tranquility.

处一居也，犹吾书所谓安行广居也。
To dwell in one place is to abide—
Just as my writings say: to walk in ease and dwell in breadth.

为万乘之主，若不知身之为重，
To rule the ten thousand chariots,
If one does not know the weight of the body—

则不能超然於事物之外，必至有轻躁之失。
Then one cannot stand aloof beyond things,
Surely falling into the faults of lightness and restlessness.

失臣者，不足以臣服天下也。
To lose ministers means
One cannot make all under Heaven submit.

失君者，言自失所主也。
To lose the self means
One has lost what one governs.

以身轻天下者，言以天下为重，以身为轻也。
To make the body light for all under Heaven—
This means to regard all under Heaven as weighty,
And the body as light.

不轻其身则知道矣，
If one does not slight the body,
Then one knows the Dao.

知道则知自然矣，
Knowing the Dao,
One knows spontaneity.

知自然则无静无重矣，而况有轻躁乎？
Knowing spontaneity,
There is neither stillness nor weight—
How much less restlessness and lightness?

**善行无辙迹章第二十七**
The chapter on *good walking leaving no tracks*—

善行无辙迹，
Good walking leaves no tracks,
善言无瑕谪，
Good speech has no flaws or blemishes,
善计不用筹策，
Good plans need no calculations or schemes,
善闭无关楗而不可开，
Good closure has no locks or bars yet cannot be opened,
善结无绳约而不可解。
Good binding has no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.

是以圣人常善救人，故无弃人，
Thus the sage always excels in saving others—
Therefore, he abandons no one,
常善教物，故无弃物，
Always excels in teaching things—
Therefore, he abandons no thing,
是谓袭明。
This is called *concealing brightness*.

故善人，不善人之师；
Thus the good person is the teacher of the not-good,
不善人，善人之资。
The not-good person is the material of the good.

不贵其师，不爱其资，
If one does not honor his teacher,
Or cherish his material—
虽智大迷，
Though wise, it is great confusion,
是谓要妙。
This is called *the essential subtlety*.

善行、善言、善计、善闭、善结，五者皆譬喻也。
Good walking, good speech, good plans, good closure, good binding—
These five are all metaphors.

其意但谓以自然为道，则无所容力，
Their meaning simply states:
If spontaneity is taken as the Dao,
Then there is no need to exert force—
亦无所着迹矣。
Nor to leave any traces.

圣人虽异於众人，而混然与之而处，
The sage, though different from the common folk,
Yet blends harmoniously with them in dwelling—
未尝有自异之心，
Never harboring a thought of self-difference,
所以不见其迹也。
Thus his traces are unseen.

圣人之道，可以救人，可以救物。
The sage’s Dao
Can save people, can save things.

其於人物也，亦甚异矣，
In its relation to people and things,
It is also very different—
而未尝有弃人弃物之心。
Yet the sage never has a heart to abandon people or things.

和光同尘而与之为一，故曰袭明。
He blends with the light and mingles with the dust,
Yet remains as one with them—
Thus it is called *concealing brightness*.

袭者，藏也，
*Concealing*—
This is *hiding*.
袭明却庄子所谓滑疑之耀也。
*Concealing brightness* is the opposite of Zhuangzi’s *shimmering doubt*—

善人可以师范一世，
The good person can serve as a model for the age—
虽异於不善之人，
Though different from the not-good—
而天下若无不善之人，则谁知善人之为善，
Yet if all under Heaven were not-good,
Who would know the good person’s goodness?
是不善人乃为善人之资也。
Thus the not-good person is the material for the good.

资者，言其赖之以自别也。
*Material*—
This means relying on it to distinguish oneself.

此两句又发明上面无弃人无弃物之意。
These two lines further elucidate
The meaning above of abandoning neither people nor things.

若有弃人弃物之心，
If one harbors a heart to abandon people or things—
则是有师而不知贵，
Then one has a teacher yet does not honor it,
有资而不知爱，
Has material yet does not cherish it—
虽自以为智，而不知乃迷之大者。
Though one may deem himself wise,
He does not know this is great confusion.

知此道者，可谓要妙之道。
He who knows this Dao
Can be called the *essential subtlety*.

**知其雄章第二十八**
The chapter on *knowing the masculine*—

知其雄，
Knowing the masculine,
守其雌，
And holding to the feminine—
为天下溪。
Makes one the valley of all under Heaven.

为天下溪，常德不离，
To be the valley of all under Heaven,
One’s constant virtue never departs—
复归於婴儿。
Returning again to the state of the infant.

知其白，
Knowing the white,
守其黑，
And holding to the black—
为天下式。
Makes one the pattern of all under Heaven.

为天下式，常德不忒，
To be the pattern of all under Heaven,
One’s constant virtue never errs—
复归於无极。
Returning again to the boundless.

知其荣，
Knowing the honor,
守其辱，
And holding to the humiliation—
为天下谷。
Makes one the valley of all under Heaven.

常德乃足，
One’s constant virtue is complete—
复归於朴。
Returning again to simplicity.

朴散则为器，
Simplicity disperses and becomes vessels—
圣人用之则为官长，
The sage uses them and becomes the ruler—
故大制不割。
Thus the great measure is not severed.

知雄守雌，不求胜也。
Knowing the masculine and holding to the feminine,
One does not seek to conquer.

知白守黑，不分别也。
Knowing the white and holding to the black,
One does not distinguish.

知荣守辱，无歆艳也。
Knowing the honor and holding to the humiliation,
One has no fondness for brilliance.

知守有能为而不为之意。
Knowing and holding implies
The power to act yet not acting.

溪谷在下，
The valley is low—
一水所归也，
Where waters converge—
言如此则天下归之。
Saying this, all under Heaven will follow.

式，天下以为式也。
*Pattern*—
This is what all under Heaven takes as its model.

常德，
Constant virtue—
即首章所谓常道也。
Is the *constant Way* spoken of in the first chapter.

不离，
Never departing—
无间断也。
Means no interruption.

不忒，
Never erring—
无差失也。
Means no deviation.

乃足，
Complete—
备全之也。
Is fully sufficient.

婴儿，
The infant—
无知也。
Is without knowledge.

无极，
The boundless—
无物也。
Is without things.

朴，
*Simplicity*—
太朴也，
This is *Great Simplicity*—
天地之始也。
The origin of Heaven and Earth.

太朴既散，而后有器，
Great Simplicity having dispersed,
Then vessels come into being—
即形而上谓之道，形而下谓之器也。
This is the Dao of *that which is above form*,
And vessels of *that which is below form*.

圣人以形而上者，用形而下者，
The sage uses *that which is above form*
And employs *that which is below form*—
则天地之间各有其职。
Thus between Heaven and Earth,
Each has its proper function.

圣人兼三才，
The sage encompasses the Three Powers—
以御万物，
To govern all things—
虽职覆职载亦听命於我，
Though functions overlap and shift,
They all obey his command—
是为天地之间，官於物者之长也。
Thus he is the ruler of all things
Between Heaven and Earth.

庄子曰：官天地。
Zhuangzi says: *He rules Heaven and Earth*.
天地之职，
The functions of Heaven and Earth—
亦造化之一官守耳。
Are but one aspect of the natural transformations.

割，
*Sever*—
离也。
Is separation.

以道制物谓之大制，
To govern things with the Dao is called *great measure*—
大制则道器不相离矣。
Great measure means the Dao and things do not separate.

此亦无为而为，自然而然之意。
This is also the meaning of *non-action yet action*,
And *spontaneity as it is*.

**将欲取天下章第二十九**
The chapter on *when one would take all under Heaven*—

将欲取天下而为之者，
When one would take all under Heaven by force—
吾见其不得已。
I see it as inevitable failure.

天下神器，
All under Heaven is a divine vessel—
不可为也。
Cannot be forced.

为者败之，
To force it is to ruin it,
执者失之。
To grasp it is to lose it.

凡物或行或随，
All things either move forward or follow—
或嘘或吹，
Either exhale or inhale—
或强或羸，
Either are strong or weak—
或载或隳。
Either are completed or destroyed.

是以圣人去甚，
Thus the sage avoids excess—
去奢，
Avoids extravagance—
去泰。
And avoids superfluity.

天下神器，
All under Heaven is a divine vessel—
岂人力所可得。
How can it be obtained by human strength?

道盛德至，
When the Dao flourishes and virtue reaches its peak—
天下归之而不得辞，
All under Heaven submits to it without refusal—
而后可以有天下。
Then one may truly possess all under Heaven.

若萌取天下之心，
If one harbors the thought of seizing all under Heaven—
而强为善，
And forcibly does good—
以求有得，
In order to gain—
次不可得矣。
Then one will surely fail.

此三句是譬喻也，
These three lines are metaphors—
其意盖言凡天下之事，
Their meaning is: all things under Heaven—
不可以有心求也。
Cannot be sought with a deliberate heart.

为者则铃败，
To force is to ring the bell of ruin,
执者则必失，
To grasp is to surely lose—
是皆有心之累也。
These are both burdens of the deliberate heart.

故有道者之於物，
Thus those who possess the Dao toward things—
行者听其自行，
Let those who move forward do so of their own accord,
随者听其自随，
Let those who follow do so naturally,
嘘者听其自嘘，
Let those who exhale do so spontaneously,
吹者听其自吹，
Let those who inhale do so freely,
强者听其自强，
Let the strong act as they will,
羸者听其自羸，
Let the weak be as they are,
成者听其自成，
Let the completed be so,
隳者听其自隳，
Let the destroyed be undone—
是皆自然而然而已。
All this is but spontaneity as it is.」

「圣人去之者，
The Sage removes it—
无心无累，无为无求也。
Without deliberation or burden, without action or seeking.

此章结得其文又奇，
This chapter concludes its text with yet another marvel—
甚、奢、泰三字只是一意，
The three words *shen* (excess), *she* (extravagance), and *tai* (profligacy) all express one meaning,
但如此下语，
Yet they are stated in this manner—
非唯是其鼓舞之笔，
Not only to inspire and exhort,
亦申言其甚不可之意。
But also to emphasize how utterly unacceptable they are.

其言玄妙，
Its language is profound and mysterious—
则曰玄之又玄，
Then it speaks of *"xuan"* beyond *"xuan"*,
则曰大，曰逝，曰远，
Then it says *"da"* (vast), *"shi"* (flowing), *"yuan"* (distant),
皆是一样文法。
All following the same rhetorical structure.

读者不悟#3 其意，
Readers who do not grasp its meaning—
故不见他文字奇处，
Thus fail to see the brilliance of its other phrasing,
又多牵强之说。
And often resort to forced interpretations.

以道佐人主章第三十
Chapter Thirty: Aiding the Sovereign with the Dao—
以道佐人主者，
Those who aid the sovereign with the Dao—
不以兵强天下，
Do not impose upon the world with arms,
其事好还。
For their actions will return upon them.

师之所处，
Where the armies encamp—
荆棘生焉。
Thorns and brambles grow.
大军之后，
After great armies—
必有凶年。
There will surely be years of calamity.
故善者果而已矣，
Thus the virtuous act decisively—
不敢以取强焉。
Without daring to seize force.

果而勿矜，
Decisive yet not arrogant,
果而勿伐，
Decisive yet not boastful,
果而勿骄，
Decisive yet not proud,
果而不得已，
Decisive yet without compulsion,
果而勿强。
Decisive yet not forceful.
物壮则老，
All things, when at their peak, decline—
是谓非道，
This is called *not* the Dao,
非道早已。
And the Dao rejects such early.

佐人主而以强兵为心，
To aid the sovereign while harboring thoughts of military might—
则非知道者矣。
Is to not truly possess the Dao.

何者？
Why?
兵，凶器也。
Because arms are instruments of violence.
我以害人，
If I use them to harm others,
人亦将以害我，
Others will surely harm me in return—
故曰其事好还。
Hence it is said: *"their actions will return upon them."*

用师之地，
Where armies are deployed—
农不得耕，
Farmers cannot till the fields,
则荆棘生矣。
Then thorns and brambles grow.
用兵之后，
After wielding arms—
伤天地之和气，
The harmony of Heaven and Earth is disrupted,
则必有凶年之苜。
Then there will surely be years of calamity.

此意但言好战求胜，
This meaning simply states that those who love war and seek victory—
非国之福。
Are not blessings for the state.
七句只是譬喻。
These seven lines are but metaphors.

若人之为善，
If people act in virtue—
其果者在我，
Its results lie within themselves,
而何尝敢以此求胜於人，
And how could they dare to use this to seek victory over others?
故曰不敢以取强。
Hence it is said: *"Without daring to seize force."*

果，《易》言果行育德是也。
*"Fruit"* (果), as the *Yijing* speaks: *"Fruitful action nurtures virtue."*
其果者在我，
Its fruit lies within oneself—
而不形诸外，
Yet does not manifest outwardly,
则无矜伐骄强之名。
Thus there is no name of arrogance, boasting, pride, or force.
而其应事也，
And in responding to affairs—
常有不得已之意，
There is always the sense of *"not being able to help it,"*
此亦知雄守雌之论。
This is also the theory of *"knowing the strong yet holding to the weak."*

强者不能终强，
The forceful cannot persist in force,
矜者不能终矜，
The arrogant cannot persist in arrogance,
譬如万物既壮#4则老必至矣。
Just as all things, once at their peak, must decline.
不知此理，
Those who do not understand this principle—
而欲以取强於天下，
Yet wish to seize force in the world—
皆不道者也。
Are all those who do not possess the Dao.
既知此为不道，
If one knows this to be *not* the Dao—
则当急急去之，
Then one must urgently abandon it,
故曰早已。
Hence it is said: *"And the Dao rejects such early."*

已者，已而勿为也。
*"Early"* (已) means: *"Having reached the limit, do not act."*

夫佳兵章第三十一
Chapter Thirty-One: *"The Fine Art of War"*—
夫佳兵者，
Now, the fine art of war—
不祥之器，
Is an ill-omened instrument,
物或恶之，
Which things may detest,
故有道者不处。
Thus those who possess the Dao do not dwell upon it.

是以君子居则贵左，
Hence, the noble one values the left in dwelling—
用兵则贵右。
Yet values the right in wielding arms.
兵者，
Arms—
不祥之器，
Are ill-omened instruments,
非君子之器，
Not the instruments of the noble,
不得已而用之，
Used only when there is no alternative,
恬淡为上。
With equanimity as the highest.

故不美也，
Thus they are not beautiful—
若美必乐之，
If they were beautiful, one would surely delight in them,
乐之者是乐杀人也。
And delighting in them is delighting in killing.
夫乐杀人者，
Now, those who delight in killing—
不可得志於天下矣。
Cannot achieve their desires in the world.

故吉事尚左，
Thus auspicious matters are honored on the left,
凶事尚右。
And inauspicious matters on the right.
是以偏将军处左，
Hence, the subordinate general is placed on the left—
上将军处右，
While the supreme general is on the right,
言居上势则以丧礼处之。
Speaking of those in high positions as if they were in mourning.

杀人众多，
Many are killed—
以悲哀泣之。
With sorrowful tears.
战胜，
When victorious in battle—
以丧礼处之。
They are treated as if in mourning.

此章全是以兵为喻，
This entire chapter uses war as a metaphor—
兼当时战争之习胜，
And incorporates the prevailing customs of war at the time,
故以此语戒之。
Thus warning with these words.
佳兵，
*"Fine art of war"*—
喜用兵者也。
Refers to those who love to use arms.
以用兵为佳，
To consider wielding arms as fine—
此不祥之人也，
This is the mark of an ill-omened person,
以不祥之人而行不祥之事，
Who engages in ill-omened deeds as an ill-omened person—
故曰不祥之器。
Hence it is said: *"Arms are ill-omened instruments."*

此天下之所恶，
This is what the world detests,
故有道者不为之。
Thus those who possess the Dao do not do it.

且君子之居，
Moreover, in dwelling—
每以左为贵，
The noble always values the left,
而兵则尚右，
Yet arms are honored on the right,
便是古人亦以兵为不祥之事。
This shows that even the ancients regarded arms as inauspicious matters.
非君子之所乐用，
Not something the noble delights in using,
必不得已而后为之，
Used only when there is no alternative,
不幸而用兵，
If misfortune compels the use of arms—
必以恬淡为尚。
One must uphold equanimity.

恬淡，无味也，
*"Equanimity"* (恬淡) is flavorless—
即是不得已之意也，
It is the same as *"not being able to help it,"*
虽胜亦不以为喜。
Even if victorious, one does not take pleasure in it.
不美者，
*"Not beautiful"*—
言用兵不是好事也。
Means that wielding arms is not a good thing.
若以用兵为喜，
If one takes pleasure in wielding arms—
则是以杀人为乐，
Then it is to delight in killing,
岂能得志於天下。
How could one achieve their desires in the world?

孟子曰：不嗜杀人者能一之。
Mencius said: *"Those who do not delight in killing can unite the world."*
亦此意也。
This is the same meaning.

偏将军之职位本在上将军之下一
The subordinate general’s rank is naturally beneath that of the supreme general—
今上将军居右，
Yet now the supreme general is on the right,
而偏将军居左，
And the subordinate general is on the left,
是古人以兵为凶事，
This is because the ancients regarded war as an inauspicious matter,
故以丧礼处之。
Thus they treated it with funeral rites.

左，阳也。
The left is *yang*—
右，阴也。
The right is *yin*—
丧礼则尚阴，
Funeral rites are associated with *yin*,
幸而战胜，
Even if victorious in battle—
亦当以居丧之礼，
One should still observe mourning rites,
泣死者而悲哀之可也。
Weeping for the dead and expressing sorrow is proper.
以势而言，
In terms of rank—
下反居上，
The lower is paradoxically placed above,
故曰言居上势。
Hence it is said: *"Those in high positions as if in mourning."*

此章之意，
The meaning of this chapter—
盖言人之处世，
Is that in life—
有心於求胜者，
Those who harbor thoughts of seeking victory—
皆为凶而不为吉也。
Are all inauspicious, not auspicious.

道常无名章第三十二
Chapter Thirty-Two: *"The Dao Is Ever Nameless"*—
道常无名，
The Dao is ever nameless,
朴虽小，
Yet the primal simplicity, though small,
天下不敢臣。
The world does not dare to treat it as a subject.
侯王若能守，
If lords and kings can uphold it,
万物将自宾。
All things will naturally submit.

天地相合，
Heaven and Earth unite—
以降甘露，
To descend sweet dew,
人莫之令而自均。
Without anyone commanding, it is naturally balanced.

始制有名，
Only when names are first imposed—
名亦既有。
Names have already been given.
夫亦将知止，
Then one must also know when to stop—
知止所以不殆。
Knowing when to stop is how one avoids ruin.

譬道之在天下，
Just as the Dao exists in the world—
由川谷之於江海也。
Is like rivers and valleys to the ocean.

道常无名，
The Dao is ever nameless—
即可名非常名也。
Thus it can be named *"the nameless beyond names."*
无名之朴，
The nameless simplicity—
道也。
Is the Dao.
虽若至小，
Though it may seem the smallest,
而天下莫不尊之，
Yet the world does not fail to revere it,
孰敢卑之，
Who dares to belittle it?
故曰不敢臣。
Hence it is said: *"The world does not dare to treat it as a subject."*

为侯王者若能守此道，
If lords and kings can uphold this Dao—
则万物自宾服之矣。
Then all things will naturally submit to them.

天至高也，
Heaven is supremely high—
下而接乎地，
Yet descends to meet the Earth,
天气下降，
Heaven’s *qi* descends,
地气上腾，
Earth’s *qi* ascends—
而后甘露降焉。
Then sweet dew descends.
天地和，
When Heaven and Earth are in harmony—
则甘露降。
Then sweet dew descends.
民之在天下，
The people in the world—
自生自养，
Naturally give birth and nurture themselves,
莫不埤平，
All things are balanced,
谁实使之，
Who truly commands it?
自然之道也。
It is the Dao of nature.

若容心而使，则不得其均平矣。
If one indulges the heart’s desires in governance, balance cannot be achieved.

道之始，本无名焉，万物既作，而后有道之名。
At its origin, the Dao was nameless—
Only after all things took form did it receive the name "Dao."

制，作也，是朴散而为器也。
*"Zhi"* means to shape—
This is when the undifferentiated simplicity (*pu*) disperses to become things.

此名既有，则一生二，二生三，何所穷已。
Once named, it gives rise to two from one,
Three from two—
Where does it end?

知道之士，当於此而知止，则不循名而逐末矣。
Those who understand the Dao must know when to stop here,
Lest they follow names and chase after trivialities.

循名逐末，则危殆之所由生也，知止则不殆矣。
Chasing after names and trifles breeds peril—
Knowing when to stop brings safety.

川谷之水，铃归之江海而后止；
The waters of streams and valleys
Flow toward the seas and only then find rest—
天下万物，必归之道而后止。
All things under Heaven
Must return to the Dao before finding rest.

故曰道之在天下，犹川谷之於江海也。
Hence it is said: *"The Dao’s place in the world
Is like streams and valleys to the seas."*

---
知人者智章第三十三
**Chapter 33: The Wise Know Others**

知人者智，自知者明。
To know others is wisdom,
To know oneself is enlightenment.

胜人者有力，自胜者强。
To overcome others requires strength,
To overcome oneself is true power.

知足者富，强行者有志。
Contentment brings wealth,
Persistent action reveals resolve.

不失其所者久，死而不亡者寿。
Whoever remains in their proper place endures—
To die without perishing is true longevity.

智，私智也。
*"Wisdom"* here means discerning others’ hidden motives.

明，在内者也。
*"Enlightenment"* is self-awareness within.

有力，角力於外者也。
*"Strength"* is outward struggle against others.

强，在内之果也。
*"True power"* is the fruit of inner mastery.

自胜者强，胜己之私谓之克也。
To conquer oneself is true power—
Overcoming personal desires is victory.

知足者富，无不足则常有余也。
Contentment is wealth—
Wanting nothing ensures abundance.

志胜气则其强也不弱，
When resolve overcomes *qi*, strength is unyielding—
得其所安则久而不变，
Finding true rest ensures enduring stability—
故曰不失其所者久。
Hence it is said: *"Whoever remains in their proper place endures."*

孔子曰：朝闻道，夕死可矣。
As Confucius said:
*"To hear the Dao in the morning,
Death at dusk would be no loss."*

死而不亡者寿，
To die without perishing is true longevity—
亦此意也。
This carries the same meaning.

此二句非言语所可解，自证自悟可也。
These two lines cannot be fully explained in words—
Self-verification and awakening suffice.

---
大道泛兮章第三十四
**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**

大道泛兮，其可左右。
The Great Dao flows unrestrained,
Moving without favor to left or right.

万物恃之以生而不辞，
All things rely on it for life, yet it does not refuse—
功成不居，
It accomplishes without claiming—
衣被万物而不为主，
It clothes all things yet claims no lordship—
故常无欲，可名於小矣；
Thus it ever desires nothing,
And may be called "small"—
万物归焉而不知主，可名於大矣。
Yet all things return to it, unaware of any master,
And so it may be called "great."

是以圣人能成其大也，
Thus the Sage achieves greatness—
以其不自大，故能成其大。
Because they do not exalt themselves,
They alone achieve true greatness.

泛兮其可左右，
Flowing without constraint,
无所系着也。
It clings to nothing.

物物皆道之所生，
All things are born of the Dao—
何尝辞之。
How could it refuse them?

既生矣，何尝居之以为功。
Once born, how could it claim them as its own deeds?

衣被，蒙赖也。
*"Clothing"* means covering and nurturing—
万物皆蒙赖其利，
All things benefit from its grace—
而道何尝有主宰之心，
Yet the Dao harbors no lordly intent—
湛然而无所欲，
Serene and desiring nothing—
可谓之自小矣，
Thus it may be called "small"—
故曰可名於小。
Hence it is named "small."

道虽小，而万物归之以为主，
Though the Dao is small,
All things return to it as their master—
道亦不自知，
Yet it knows not itself—
岂不谓之大乎？
How then is it not called "great"?

惟其能小，所以能大，
Only by being small
Can it achieve greatness—
圣人之所以不为大者，故能成其大也。
The Sage does not claim greatness,
And thus achieves true greatness.

此即守其雌，为天下溪之意。
This is the meaning of *"embracing the feminine"* and *"being a valley to the world."*

---
执大象章第三十五
**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Image**

执大象，天下往。
Hold fast to the Great Image,
And all under Heaven will follow.

往而不害，安平泰。
Following without obstruction,
They find peace, balance, and ease.

乐与饵，过客止。
Offer music and feasts,
And passing guests will linger.

道之出言，淡乎其无味。
The Dao’s words, when spoken,
Are bland, without relish.

视之不足见，听之不足闻，
To look upon it is unsatisfying,
To listen is unfulfilling—
用之不可既。
Yet its use is inexhaustible.

大象者，无象之象也。
The "Great Image" is the form of the formless—
天下往者，执道而往行之天下也。
Those who follow are those who uphold the Dao in their actions.

以道而行，则天下孰得而害之。
Acting in accordance with the Dao,
Who under Heaven could harm them?

天下无所害，则安矣，平矣，泰矣。
Without harm in the world,
They are at peace, balanced, and at ease.
三字亦只一意也。
These three words convey a single meaning.

乐，钟鼓之乐也。
*"Music"* refers to ceremonial bells and drums—
饵，饮食也。
*"Feasts"* means food and drink.
张乐设馔以待嘉客，
Setting out music and banquets to welcome honored guests—
乐终食尽，客过则止矣。
When the music ends and the feast is done,
Guests depart.

过者，去也，
*"Over"* means to leave—
是筵席必有散时也。
Banquets must eventually conclude.

道之可味，虽若甚淡，
Though the Dao’s flavor seems bland—
视之虽不可见，
Though it cannot be seen—
听之虽不足闻，
Though it cannot be heard—
言其不足悦耳目也，
This is because it does not please the senses—
而用之於今古而不尽。
Yet its use spans past and present without end.

此即物有尽而道无穷之意。
This conveys the idea that *"things are finite, but the Dao is boundless."*

道之出言，道形於言也，
The Dao’s words are its manifestation in speech—
犹曰道之为言也。
As if to say: *"The Dao’s name."*

将欲噏之章第三十六
**Chapter 36: Before Taking Away**

将欲噏之，必固张之；
Before you can gather,
You must first stretch it taut—
将欲弱之，必固强之；
Before you can weaken,
You must first strengthen—
将欲废之，必固兴之；
Before you can discard,
You must first establish—
将欲夺之，必固与之，
Before you can take,
You must first give—
是谓微明。
This is called *"subtle enlightenment."*

柔之胜刚，弱之胜强。
Softness overcomes hardness,
Weakness overcomes strength.

鱼不可脱於渊，
Fish cannot escape the depths—
国之利器，不可以示人。
Nor should a nation’s sharpest tools be displayed to all.

此章前八句皆是譬喻，
These first eight lines are all metaphors—
只是得便宜处失便宜之意。
Illustrating the principle of *"gaining advantage by first yielding advantage."*

噏，敛也，弛也。
*"Nyon"* means to gather or relax—
张者必弛，
What is stretched must relax—
强者必弱，
What is strong must weaken—
兴必有废，
What is established must decay—
得必有失。
What is gained must be lost.

与，得也。
*"Give"* means to grant—
夺，失也。
*"Take"* means to deprive.

人#5 惟不知，自以为喜，
#5 People, in their ignorance, take pleasure—
而不知此理虽晦而实明，
Yet they fail to see that though this principle seems obscure,
故曰微明#6。
It is truly enlightening.

微，犹晦也，
*"Subtle"* is like *"obscure"*—
言虽微而甚易见也。
Saying that though subtle, it is easily perceived.

但能柔弱，必可以胜刚强，
Only by embracing softness and weakness
必可以胜刚强，
Can one overcome hardness and strength—
此亦守雌守黑之意。
This too is the meaning of *"embracing the feminine and the dark."*

渊，喻道也。
*"The depths"* symbolize the Dao—
鱼，喻人也。
*"Fish"* symbolize people.
人之不能外於道，犹鱼之不可脱於渊也。
Just as people cannot exist outside the Dao,
So fish cannot escape the depths.

国之利器，若以示人，盗贼之招也。
A nation’s sharpest tools,
If displayed to others, invite thieves.

道之为用在我，
The Dao’s power lies within—
若自眩露而以求胜於物，
Yet if one flaunts it to outdo others—
亦犹以国之利器而示人也。
It is like displaying a nation’s sharpest tools.

此亦前章善者果而已，不可以取强之意。
This too echoes the earlier idea:
*"The good are content with their harvest—
They do not seek to dominate."*

道常无为章第三十七
**Chapter 37: The Dao Ever Does Nothing**

道常无为，而无不为。
The Dao ever does nothing,
Yet nothing remains undone.

侯王若能守，万物将自化。
If lords and kings could uphold it,
All things would transform of their own accord.

化而欲作，吾将镇以无名之朴。
When transformation stirs to action,
I would restrain it with the nameless simplicity.

无名之朴，亦将不欲，
The nameless simplicity would also desire nothing—
不欲以静，
Desiring nothing, it would remain still—
天下将自正。
And the world would naturally align itself.

此章与道常无名章语势皆同。
This chapter’s structure mirrors *"The Dao Ever Has No Name."*

The Dao does nothing yet does everything—
This is the natural way of things.

If lords and kings could uphold this Dao of non-action,
They would not strive to transform all things,
Yet all things would transform on their own.

Between Heaven and Earth, when transformations stir to rise,
I would only restrain them with the nameless simplicity.

Transformation is the change of all things.
When myriad changes arise together,
Endlessly pursuing one another,
I would simply abide in the natural way.

They grow tumultuous, yet I remain serene—
Thus it is called *restraint*.

The "transformation" in the latter clause
Should not be read as echoing the "transformation" above.

What is this "nameless simplicity"?
It is simply the absence of desire.

Without desire, there is stillness;
With stillness, the world naturally aligns itself.

"Not desiring" is the same as "without desire,"
Yet the "not" also carries the meaning of "do not"—
This is where effort is applied.

**Volume Three: *The Daoist Classic’s Oral Commentary*
*By Lin Xiqi of the Yuzhai Studio*

**Volume Three: *The Daoist Classic’s Oral Commentary***

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: *"The Virtue/Power of the Non-Ultimate"***

The Virtue/Power of the Non-Ultimate does not cling to virtue/power—
Thus it has virtue/power.
The virtue/power of the Lowly does not lose virtue/power—
Thus it lacks virtue/power.

The Virtue/Power of the Non-Ultimate acts without effort yet nothing remains undone;
The virtue/power of the Lowly acts with effort yet something remains incomplete.
The Virtue/Power of the Highest Benevolence acts without effort yet nothing remains undone;
The Virtue/Power of the Highest Righteousness acts with effort yet something remains incomplete.
The Virtue/Power of the Highest Ceremony acts with effort yet none respond—
Then they roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.

Thus, one loses the Dao/Way and then gains virtue/power,
Loses virtue/power and then gains benevolence,
Loses benevolence and then gains righteousness,
Loses righteousness and then gains ceremony.

Ceremony is the thin veneer of loyalty and trustworthiness,
And the beginning of chaos.
Preemptive knowledge is the adornment of the Dao/Way,
And the origin of folly.

Thus, the true person dwells in substance, not in veneer;
Dwells in reality, not in adornment.

Hence, they abandon the latter and take the former.

The person of the Non-Ultimate’s Virtue/Power possesses virtue/power yet does not know their own transformative power—
Only their ability to transform is why they have virtue/power.
Those who do not lose virtue/power cling to it without transformation—
Clinging without transformation is not yet virtue/power,
Hence it is called lacking virtue/power.

The Virtue/Power of the Non-Ultimate and the Lowly are merely the continuation of the previous chapter’s discussion on the *Taishang*’s Way.

*"Acts without effort yet nothing remains undone"* means *"acts without effort yet nothing is left undone."* (i)
The *"for"* (以) is the presence of intention.
*"Nothing remains undone"* is acting without intention.

The Lowly’s *"something remains incomplete"* is the result of deliberate action—
Of form and contrivance.
Having spoken of the Non-Ultimate’s and the Lowly’s virtue/power,
He then follows with benevolence and righteousness.

*"The Virtue/Power of the Highest Benevolence acts without effort yet nothing remains undone"*—
This is benevolence as the Non-Ultimate’s virtue/power.
*"The Virtue/Power of the Highest Righteousness acts with effort yet something remains incomplete"*—
This is righteousness as the Lowly’s virtue/power.

The Master Laozi’s teachings regard ceremony as a means to strengthen the world,
First using benevolence and righteousness to modulate and balance its application,
Then proceeding to ceremony—
Thus ceremony is the most inferior of the three.

To act yet meet no response is to compel the people while they do not follow—
*Reng* (仍), to draw or pull.
The people do not follow, yet they are compelled by force.
*Reng* is the act of forcibly drawing or pulling.
This is merely a vivid description of compelling the people—
Hence it is said: *"They roll up their sleeves and force it upon them."*

The Dao/Way is natural.
Virtue/Power is what is obtained.
The natural transforms, the obtained does not—
Hence it is said: *"One loses the Dao/Way and then gains virtue/power."*

Benevolence has the heart of love and benefit,
And is yet lower than virtue/power.
Righteousness has the heart of judgment and restraint,
And is yet lower than benevolence.
Ceremony has the intention of compelling the people,
And is yet lower than righteousness.

The Master Laozi’s terms for *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), and *li* (ceremony)
Differ in meaning from those of Confucius and Mencius—
One may seek their intent within his text.
If one insists on their conventional meanings,
Then they are all misapplied.

Ceremony is the thin veneer of loyalty and trustworthiness—
It speaks of outward adornment without inner sincerity.
Its intent is that ceremony arises from human artifice,
Hence it is called the beginning of chaos.

Preemptive knowledge is the accumulation of past words and deeds.
To take this as wisdom is to stray from the true Dao/Way.
*Hua* (华) is the pursuit of externals.
If one takes this as wisdom, it is in fact self-delusion—
Hence it is called the origin of folly.

*"Substance"* and *"reality"* are merely the intent of pursuing the inner.
*"Abandon the latter and take the former"* means one does not adhere to ceremony but to the Dao/Way.
This is the Dao/Way.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: *"The One of Old"***

The One of Old—
Heaven obtains the One and thus becomes clear,
Earth obtains the One and thus becomes settled and tranquil,
The spirit obtains the One and thus becomes responsive and alive,
The grain obtains the One and thus becomes full,
All things obtain the One and thus come to life,
The lords and kings obtain the One and thus establish their rectitude over the world.

Their attainment is all through the One—
Heaven without the One would fear dissolution,
Earth without the One would fear upheaval,
The spirit without the One would fear stagnation,
The grain without the One would fear exhaustion,
All things without the One would fear annihilation,
The lords and kings without the One would fear losing their noble standing.

Thus, the noble depends on the humble as its root,
The high depends on the low as its foundation.

Hence, the lords and kings call themselves *"lonely"* (孤), *"few"* (寡), *"not abundant"* (不谷)—
Is this their dependence on the humble as root?
Or is it not?

Thus, they have many chariots yet no chariots,
Do not desire to be rounded like jade,
Nor to be polished like stone.

The One is the Dao/Way.
Heaven’s clarity and the manifestation of its forms are through this Dao/Way,
Earth’s tranquility and its capacity to bear all things are through this Dao/Way,
The spirit’s responsiveness and vitality are through this Dao/Way,
The grain’s fullness and abundance are through this Dao/Way—
All are through this Dao/Way.

All things’ coming to life is also through this Dao/Way,
The lords and kings’ rectitude over the myriad lands is also through this Dao/Way.
Their attainment is through this Dao/Way—
This is why they become clear, tranquil, alive, full, and rectified,
All through this Dao/Way.

*Lie* (裂) is akin to *"breaking"* in the *Zhouyi* (I Ching) as *"segmented."*
*Fa* (发) is movement without stability.
*Xie* (歇) is the fading of responsiveness and vitality.
*Jie* (竭) is exhaustion.
The empty can receive—
The unempty is exhausted and thus cannot receive.

*Ju* (蹶) is akin to *"falling"* or *"losing one’s place."*
To be in a noble and high position yet lack this is to be like the fallen—
Hence it is said: *"The noble and high would fear losing their standing."*

The humble and the low are as the previous chapter’s *"few, yet they obtain it"*—
All are empty yet not self-possessed.

The two sentences on *"the noble depends on the humble"* and *"the high depends on the low"*
Are mere metaphors.
Without the humble, how can there be the noble?
Without the low, how can there be the high?
The low and the humble are the fundamental basis of the noble and the high.

The lords and kings’ self-designation as *"lonely"* (孤), *"few"* (寡人), *"not abundant"* (不谷)
Are all words of self-humility,
And also metaphors for emptiness without self-possession.

*"Or is it not?"* (非乎) asks:
If I say this, is there not truth in it?
Zhuangzi said: *"‘Or is it not?’—Yet the historian Zengzi agreed!"*
This is of the same rhetorical style,
A peculiar turn in the text.

*"They have many chariots yet no chariots"*—
Originally read *"They have many praises yet no praises"* (数誉无誉),
But *"praise"* (誉) is incorrect.
These two sentences are metaphors—
If read as *"praise,"* they do not align with the later imagery of *"like jade"* and *"like stone."*

*Zhi* (致) means *"to arrive at"* or *"to attain,"*
Hence *"their attainment"* is akin to *"their reaching this state."*
The chariot is a collective term—
Counting its parts—wheels, hubs, spokes, shafts, and crossbars—
Then there is no chariot,
The chariot becomes merely a hollow name.

The state of being like jade or like stone—
then it shines with a *lingling* brilliance,
falls with a *luoluan* resonance,
and is ultimately unchangeable.

A chariot may be had or not had,
but jade and stone are fixed and unchangeable.
That which may be had or not had
approaches the Dao—
empty yet transformative.

That which is fixed and unchangeable
does not transform.

Zhuangzi said: *"To say ‘no years’"*—
also expressing the meaning of *"counting chariots yet no chariots."*

**Chapter Forty: The Movement of the Dao Through Reversal**
Reversal is the Dao’s dynamic principle,
weakness is the Dao’s application.

All things arise from existence,
existence arises from non-existence.

Reversal means return,
means stillness—
stillness is the source from which movement arises,
as in the *Yijing*’s saying:
*"Guàn completes the end and begins the beginning."*

Only by being weak can one become strong;
to fixate on strength is to break.

Movement employs stillness as its function,
strength employs weakness as its function—
thus it is said:
*Reversal is the Dao’s dynamic principle,*
*weakness is the Dao’s application in strength.*

Such phrasing follows grammatical structure.

Only after Heaven and Earth do all things exist—
thus it is said: *"Things arise from existence."*
Yet who gave birth to Heaven and Earth?
Heaven and Earth first arose from the Great Void—
thus they arise from non-existence.
Through movement, stillness, strength, and weakness,
the origin of existence and non-existence is further expounded.

The teachings of Laozi
largely emphasize emptiness,
emphasize weakness,
emphasize lowliness—
thus, extending this to the space between Heaven and Earth,
he speaks broadly of existence, non-existence, movement, and stillness,
yet does not limit himself to Heaven and Earth alone.

**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Man Hears the Dao**
The superior man hears the Dao,
diligently practices it;

「中士闻道，若存若亡；
The middle-ranking man hears the Dao,
as if it were both present and absent.

下士闻道，大笑之，不笑不足以为道。
The inferior man hears the Dao,
and laughs greatly at it—
for if he does not laugh,
it is not worthy to be called the Dao.

故建言有之：
Thus, it is said:

明道若昧，
The Dao is bright as if in darkness—
for only in darkness does brightness shine.

夷道若类，
The Great Dao is smooth as if blending with the common—
for the Great Dao knows no distinctions,
and harmonizes with the dust of the world.

进道若退，
Advancing in the Dao appears as retreat—
for true retreat is the path to true progress.

上德若谷，
The highest virtue is deep as a valley—
for it is empty yet not self-asserting.

大白若辱，
The greatest purity is stained as dishonor—
for it does not gleam ostentatiously to set itself apart.

广德若不足，
Vast virtue seems insufficient—
for if it were self-sufficient,
it would be narrow indeed.

建德若偷，
Establishing virtue appears as furtive—
for it is done by those who act,
yet hesitate lest they be seen.

质真若渝，
Pure authenticity seems to flow like water—
for its true and unchanging essence
holds no trace of alteration,
yet appears as if already transformed.
This too is the meaning of sufficiency without self-sufficiency.

大方无隅，
The greatest square has no corners—
for within the Great Void,
though there be east, west, south, and north,
who can discern its boundaries?

大器晚成，
Great vessels take time to form—
like casting a tripod,
how could it be swiftly completed?

大音希声，
Great sound is rare in voice—
the greatest sounds between Heaven and Earth
are none greater than wind and thunder,
yet they are not always heard.
Rare means seldom seen.

大象无形，
Great form is shapeless—
for the form of Heaven and Earth,
who can fully perceive?

道隐无名，
The Dao is hidden and nameless—
for it cannot be captured by name.

此数句，或是指实之语，或是譬喻之语，其意皆主於能虚能无而已。
These words,
whether pointing to reality or using metaphor,
all emphasize the power of emptiness and non-attachment.

贷者，与也，推以及人也，
*Acquiring* means giving—
to extend and share with others,
for those who embody the Dao
can give without possessing.

成者，道之大成也，
*Completion* is the great fulfillment of the Dao—
fulfilling oneself and all things,
and only then is it called great fulfillment.

后章又曰：既以与人，己愈多。
As the next chapter states:
*"After giving to others,
one’s own abundance increases."*
This too reflects the same meaning.

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Gives Birth to One**」

**Chapter Forty-Three: The Dao Gives Birth to One**
The Dao gives birth to One,
One gives birth to Two,
Two gives birth to Three,
Three gives birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin while embracing yang,
and their harmonizing *qi* arises from their interplay.

What people detest—
the solitary, the widowed, the childless—
are the very titles kings and nobles claim.
Thus, some things are diminished to grow,
and others are increased to diminish.

What people teach as doctrine,
is also my teaching of *yi* (rightness).
The overbearing shall not meet a natural end.
I shall take this as my guiding principle.

One is the *Tai Ji*.
Two is Heaven and Earth.
Three is the Three Powers.
All speech arises from the void.

The Dao is the origin of all things,
the natural principle of spontaneity.
Once the Three Powers are established,
then the myriad things are born.

The myriad things take form through yin and yang,
and their vitality flows through the harmonizing *qi* of emptiness.
What people detest most—
the solitary, the widowed, the childless—
are titles kings and nobles adopt,
a metaphor for those who embody the Dao in humility and selflessness.

Its meaning is this:
Heaven, Earth, and humanity all arise from non-being.
The myriad things take yin and yang as their substance,
and their eternal generation comes from the harmonizing *qi* of emptiness.
Those who study the Dao must embody this—
valuing emptiness and non-attachment above all.

In the world, some things are diminished to grow,
and others are increased to diminish—
the principle of gain and loss is not constant.
Like the moon, when full it must wane—
this is growth leading to loss.
When waned, it swells again—
this is loss leading to growth.

What people teach as doctrine
refers to the teachings of this age,
yet they say: *"My teachings are all of rightness."*
But those who seek only gain,
who seek only victory,
know not that the rigid breaks,
that fullness cannot endure.
Thus, the overbearing shall not meet a natural end.

If I teach through the Dao,
I shall stand above all others—
the model all should follow.
Thus, I say: *"I shall be their guiding teacher."*

---

**Chapter Forty-Four: The World’s Ultimate Softness**
The world’s ultimate softness
overcomes the world’s ultimate hardness.
Nothing enters where there is no gap—
thus one knows the benefit of *wuwei*.

The teaching of the unsaid,
the benefit of *wuwei*—
few in the world can attain it.

The rigid is easily broken;
the soft endures forever.
To move through the world’s ultimate hardness with ultimate softness—
like water wearing away stone.

*"No gap"* refers to the seamless *tan* (altar).
*"Nothing enters"* means formlessness—
like the circulation of *yingwei* (nutritive and defensive *qi*) within the body,
or the unbroken spaces where sunlight enters.
This is *"nothing entering where there is no gap."*
These two lines are metaphorical.

From this, one understands
the supreme principle of *wuwei* as *wuwei* yet *wuwei* as *youwei*.

The unsaid yet teaching takes effect,
the undone yet benefits are achieved—
these are the wondrous applications of the Dao.
Few in the world can comprehend them.

*"Benefit"* means functional efficacy.

---

**Chapter Forty-Five: Great Fullness as if Deficient**
Great fullness seems deficient—
its use is inexhaustible.
Great abundance seems empty—
its use is boundless.
Great straightness seems crooked,
great skill seems clumsy,
great eloquence seems inarticulate.

Excessive vigor overcomes cold,
excessive stillness overcomes heat—
clearing and stillness are the world’s norm.

When fullness exists, deficiency follows.
Great fullness ever seems deficient—
thus its use is inexhaustible.
When abundance exists, emptiness follows.
Great abundance ever seems empty—
thus its use is boundless.

As the previous chapter states:
*"Hollowed becomes full,
worn becomes renewed"*—
this is the same meaning.

Great straightness ever seems crooked—
crookedness is true straightness.
The curved preserves completeness.
Great skill ever seems clumsy—
it does not boast.
Great eloquence ever seems inarticulate—
it does not speak much.

Excessive vigor reaches cold,
excessive stillness reaches heat.
Vigor and stillness are but yin and yang—
when *qi* stagnates in one extreme, it becomes a disorder.
Only the Dao’s clearing and stillness,
neither being nor non-being,
neither motion nor stillness,
is the world’s true norm—
the model for all under Heaven.

---

**Chapter Forty-Six: When the World Embraces the Dao**
When the world embraces the Dao,
even swift horses plow fields.
When the world rejects the Dao,
warhorses breed in the suburbs.

No guilt is greater than craving,
no disaster than insatiability,
no blame than greed.
Thus, true sufficiency is always sufficient.

To drive swift horses backward to till fields—
this means not valuing rare goods.
Warhorses breeding in the suburbs—
this speaks of warfare.

All conflicts arise from desire.
Once desire takes root,
when will it ever be enough?

**Chapter Forty-Six (continued): On the Pursuit of Desire**
Only the pursuit of what one *desires* is the root of guilt, disaster, and blame.
Only those who *know sufficiency* regard what they lack as enough—
then they are always sufficient.
This further elucidates the previous chapter’s meaning of *knowing sufficiency* without humiliation.

**Chapter Forty-Seven: Knowing Without Venturing Forth**
Not venturing beyond one’s door,
yet knowing all under Heaven;
Not peering through a window,
yet seeing the Dao of the world.
The farther one goes,
the less one knows.
Thus, the Sage does not move yet knows,
does not see yet names,
does not act yet accomplishes.
Though the world be vast,
the emotions of humanity and the principles of things are but one—
one can know them even without stepping beyond one’s door.
Though the Dao of the world be subtle,
the transformations of yin and yang
remain constant through the ages—
one can perceive them even without peering through a window.
If one must venture forth to seek them,
then what one reaches is limited,
and what one knows is few.
The eye’s range is limited,
and what one sees is few.
The more one exerts,
the more one’s mind grows dim—
thus it is said: *the farther one goes, the less one knows*.
This is also a metaphor to clarify the following verse.

Not moving yet knowing,
not seeking to see yet having a name,
not acting yet accomplishing—
this is the Sage’s Dao,
and thus its application.

The *Yijing* says:
*"Swift without haste, arriving without moving."*
This too conveys the same meaning.

**Chapter Forty-Eight: Daily Learning Increases**

**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage’s Heart is Without Fixed Attachment**

To learn is to daily gain,
To cultivate the Dao is to daily lose.
Lose and lose again,
Until one reaches *wuwei*—
*Wuwei*, yet nothing remains undone.
Thus those who take the world
Always act with *wuwei*—
But once they have *shi*,
They are no longer fit to take the world.

To learn is to daily seek self-benefit,
To cultivate the Dao is to daily seek self-loss.
Hence the earlier saying: *“When learning ceases, worries end”*—
For the Dao does not lie in perception or hearing.

The *Dàhuì* states:
*“The more one reads, the more *wúmíng* one has.”*
This too conveys the same meaning.

Discard cleverness,
Abandon the body’s strength,
Banish knowledge and old habits#1—
Then lose and lose again,
And one may attain *wuwei* and *wuwei* yet nothing undone.

Those who take the world conceal *wuxin*,
For those with *xin* will lose it again.
How could the Three Dynasties#2 have held the world with *xin*?

Using the customs of their time—
Warfare as metaphor—
Their words suffice as warning,
For this book often holds such meaning.

*Wuwei* and *shi* are the same as *wuxin* and *yǒuxin*.

**Chapter Fifty: The Sage’s Heart Embodies Life and Death**

Life and death intertwined.
Those who cling to life—thirteen in ten,
Those who cling to death—thirteen in ten,
Yet among the people,
Those who live are thrust into *sǐdì*#3—thirteen in ten.

Why is this so?
Because of the excess of their *shēngshēng*#4.

**Chapter Fifty: The Art of Nurturing Life**

Those who excel in nurturing life
Walk the land without meeting rhinoceros or tiger,
Enter battle without bearing armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros finds no place to strike with its horn,
The tiger finds no place to strike with its claws,
Weapons find no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this so?
Because there is no *sǐdì* within them.

*"Outborn, inborn"*—these four characters are the chapter’s guiding thread.
There is a subtle mystery in the mechanism of life and death:
When one *outborns*, it is to transcend and depart;
When one *inborns*, it is to be lost in confusion.
Only those who follow the Dao can *inborn* and then *outborn*.

Heaven has twelve *shén* (constellations),
The year has twelve months,
The day has twelve *shí* (hours).
Twelve is the completeness of beginning and end.
Yet when one adds another number to twelve,
It becomes thirteen—a clear return to the *yī* (one),
Not called *yī* but *shísān*,
This is the peculiarity of its phrasing,
Speaking of how all human life and death originate from this *yī*.

*Yī* is the *jǐ* (precursor).
If one cultivates it in accordance with the Dao,
Then one may attain longevity and enduring vision.
If one cultivates it contrary to the Dao,
Then one will perish with all things.

*"Tú"* refers to their kind.
The character *yī* is difficult to speak of,
Yet even naming the beginning of a single thought is not precise—
One must recognize it within oneself.

*"The people’s life"*—those who live in the world,
Their tendency toward *sǐdì* lies in the initial impulse of this single thought.
Once that impulse is unstable,
Movement leads directly to *sǐdì*.

*"Dòng"* is not the *dòng* of motion and stillness,
But the *dòng* of hasty action.
*"Zhī"* means "to go."
*"Sǐdì"* is the place of death.
*"Fúhézé?"*—a rhetorical question.

These words are the foundation of all ancient and modern cultivation.
Thus, Laozi speaks of them with great care.
*"Shēng"* is what gives rise to me.
*"Shēngshēng"* is how I nurture my life.
If nurturing life becomes excessive,
Then movement leads directly to *sǐdì*.

This is the meaning of:
Lightening the body to preserve it,
Having nothing to possess all,
Being empty to attain fullness,
Diminishing to increase.

Now returning to *"Guāiwén"*—
I have heard of those ancient masters of nurturing life,
Who, even walking through deep forests, did not meet rhinoceros or tiger,
And, entering battle, were not harmed by armor or weapons—
Because they had no *xin*, things could not harm them.
The rhinoceros could not gore,
The tiger could not maul,
Weapons could not wound—
All because they had no *xin*.

Zhuangzi said:
*"Enter water and it does not wet you,
Enter fire and it does not burn you."*
This is the same meaning.

*"Fúhézé?"*—another question,
Asking why things could not harm them—
Because they could be empty, could diminish, could be without,
And thus had no *sǐdì*.

This chapter contains two *"Fúhézé?"* questions,
Their meaning is profound,
Revealing Laozi’s profound application.
In ancient times, there was a temple with a pond before it,
Where a vicious water dragon dwelled—
No one dared approach.
A monk arrived from afar, unaware of it,
And, reaching the pond’s edge, stripped and bathed.
Onlookers warned him:
*"This pond holds a vicious dragon—you must not bathe!"*
The monk replied:
*"I have no intent to harm things,
Things have no intent to harm me."*
He bathed and emerged unscathed.
Laozi’s words, though seemingly empty,
Are proven true by this account.

**Chapter Fifty-One: The Dao Gives Birth, Virtue Nourishes**

The Dao gives birth to it,
Virtue nurtures it,
Things shape it,
Circumstances complete it.
Thus, all things do not fail to honor the Dao and revere virtue.

The Dao’s eminence,
Virtue’s nobility—
None command them, yet they act naturally.
Thus, the Dao gives birth, nurtures, grows, matures,
Completes, ripens, sustains, and shelters.
Giving birth yet not possessing,
Acting yet not relying,
Growing yet not ruling—
This is called *Xuándé* (Mysterious Virtue).

The Dao is *naturally* without,
All things arise from non-being,
Thus, *"The Dao gives birth to it."*
Virtue, however, has its path,
Thus, *"Virtue nurtures it."*
*Nurturing* means *having*.
Things have form,
Thus, *"Things shape it."*
Circumstances have opposition,
Thus, *"Circumstances complete it."*
The interplay of yin and yang,
The succession of the four seasons—
These are all *circumstances*.

*"Mò zhī mìng"*—meaning *"none command it, yet it acts"*—
Not by any deliberate force,
But by constant naturalness.

*"Zūn guì"*—speaking of their transcendence above all things.
*"Mìng"* is not *"爵"* (nobility).

*"Grow, mature, complete, ripen, sustain, shelter"*—
All speak of the process after birth and possession,
Where, within heaven and earth,
Life endlessly generates—
All the work of transformation.
Yet the Creator does not possess what it creates,
Does not claim credit for its deeds,
Though it governs, it has no masterful intent—
This is the mystery of *Xuándé*.
*Xuándé* is the very process of transformation.

The previous chapter spoke of losing the Dao and then virtue;
This chapter speaks of the Dao giving birth and virtue nurturing,
Honoring the Dao and valuing virtue—
Thus, the character *dé* here differs from the previous chapter.
Readers of *Laozi* must not be so rigid in their distinctions.

**Chapter Fifty-Two: The Origin of the World**

The world has its origin,
Which serves as the world’s mother.
Having obtained its mother,
One knows its children;
Having known its children,
One returns to guard its mother—
And thus, one’s life is never in peril.

Close its openings,
Shut its gates,
And one’s life will never be exhausted.
Open its openings,
And one’s affairs will be completed—
Yet one’s life will never be saved.

Seeing what is small is called *míng* (clarity),
Guarding what is soft is called *qiáng* (strength).
Using its light,
One returns to its clarity.
Without leaving oneself to calamity,
This is called *"clinging to the constant."*

The world has its origin,
Which serves as the world’s mother—
That is, the named mother of all things.

The world’s mother, **造化** (*Zàohuà* / Transformation and Creation),
The world’s children, **万物** (*wànwù* / all things).
Knowing **造化** (*Zàohuà* / Transformation and Creation) one then knows **万物** (*wànwù* / all things);
Knowing **万物** (*wànwù* / all things), one must again know **造化** (*Zàohuà* / Transformation and Creation),
For indeed, **无** (*wu* / the Unmanifest) cannot give rise to **有** (*yǒu* / the Manifest),
Yet **有** (*yǒu* / the Manifest) arises from **无** (*wu* / the Unmanifest).
Those who know **有** (*yǒu* / the Manifest) must not fail to know **无** (*wu* / the Unmanifest).

To dwell in **无** (*wu* / the Unmanifest) without desire, one beholds its subtleties;
To dwell in **有** (*yǒu* / the Manifest) without desire, one beholds its limits—
This is the same intent.

*"Never in peril"* (*没身不殆* / *mòshēn bùdài*)
Means that in this way, one’s life will never meet with danger or disaster.

**兑** (*duì* / *mouth/opening*), the mouth of man,
The **门** (*mén* / *gate*) of a dwelling—
Both are metaphors for the source from which all things emerge,
As earlier spoken of in the **玄牝** (*Xuán Dàn* / *Mysterious Feminine*).

To **塞其兑** (*sài qí duì* / *close its mouth/opening*)
And **闭其门** (*bì qí mén* / *shut its gate*)
Is to conceal **有** (*yǒu* / the Manifest) within **无** (*wu* / the Unmanifest), revealing it not.

*"Never exhausted"* (*不勤* / *bùqín*)
Is to achieve success without labor.

To **开其兑** (*kāi qí duì* / *open its mouth/opening*)
Is to emerge and put it to use.

*"Affairs completed"* (*济其事* / *jì qí shì*)
Is to use it while seeking benefit—
**济** (*jì* / *benefit*) is **益** (*yì* / *gain*).

Thus, its peril cannot be saved.

What is seen is vast,
Yet when one gathers and makes it small, this is called *至明* (*extreme clarity*).
What is held is rigid,
Yet when one withdraws and guards what is soft, this is called *至强* (*extreme strength*).
Thus, not revealing oneself is *clarity*,
Not boasting of oneself is *long-lasting* (*strength*).

**光** (*guāng* / *radiance*) is the use of **明** (*míng* / *clarity*);
**明** (*míng* / *clarity*) is the substance of **光** (*guāng* / *radiance*).
To use its **光** (*guāng* / *radiance*) and return it to **明** (*míng* / *clarity*)
Is to avoid calamity and blame.

Knowing use yet failing to know concealment is the way of incurring disaster.
**袭** (*xí* / *clinging/preserving*) is **藏** (*cáng* / *concealing*);
**常** (*cháng* / *constant/eternal*) is **不易** (*bùyì* / *unchangeable*).
*"Clinging to the constant"* (*袭常* / *xícháng*)
Means to conceal its use without depletion.
**常** (*cháng* / *constant*) should not be mistaken for **裳** (*cháng* / *lower garment*)—this is incorrect.

**Chapter Fifty-Three: The Unyielding Daoist**
If I were steadfast and unyielding,
To walk the **大道** (*Dàodào* / *Great Dao/Way*)
Would be to fear only **施** (*shī* / *excessive giving*).

The **大道** (*Dàodào* / *Great Dao/Way*) is most level,
Yet people prefer narrow paths.
The **朝** (*cháo* / *court*) is most orderly,
Yet fields are left untended,
Granaries are left empty,
Ornaments and fine adornments are displayed,
Weapons of sharp steel are worn,
Feasts are indulged in,
Wealth is hoarded—
This is called **盗夸** (*Dào Kuā* / *robber’s display*).

This is not the Dao.
**介然** (*jièrán* / *unyielding*) means firm yet untransforming.

**Chapter Fifty-Four: The Firmly Established**
The firmly established does not uproot,
The firmly embracing does not loosen.
A son and grandson are maintained for sacrifices without interruption.

Cultivate it in the body, and its **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) becomes true;
Cultivate it in the family, and its **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) becomes abundant;
Cultivate it in the village, and its **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) becomes enduring;
Cultivate it in the state, and its **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) becomes flourishing;
Cultivate it in the world, and its **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) becomes universal.

Thus, observe the body with the body,
Observe the family with the family,
Observe the village with the village,
Observe the state with the state,
Observe the world with the world.

How do I know the world’s thusness?
By this.

The firmly established is ever uprooted,
The firmly embracing is ever loosened—
Unless **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) is firmly established
And **朴** (*pǔ* / *primordial simplicity*) is firmly embraced,
Then it shall neither uproot nor loosen.

A family with sons and grandsons
Must never cease its sacrifices.

The **Dao/Way** generates **一** (*yī* / *oneness*), **一** (*yī* / *oneness*) generates **二** (*èr* / *twoness*), **二** (*èr* / *twoness*) does not generate **三** (*sān* / *threeness*), and **三** (*sān* / *threeness*) generates the myriad things.
Generation follows generation without end—
Just as sons and grandsons inherit a family.

These three sentences are all analogies,
Speaking of how the **Dao/Way**, though seemingly nonexistent, truly endures.

Cultivate it in the body, and it is real without deceit;
Cultivate it in the family, and it accumulates with lasting blessings;
Cultivate it in the village, and it earns the village’s reverence;
Cultivate it in the state, and its influence grows ever greater;
Cultivate it in the world, and its reach extends ever farther.

**長** (*cháng* / *enduring*) means revered,
**豐** (*fēng* / *flourishing*) means abundant,
**普** (*pǔ* / *universal*) means far-reaching.

From my own body, I can observe others’ bodies,
From my own family, I can observe others’ families,
From my own village, I can observe others’ villages—
Extending this to states and the world applies equally.
This is the **Dao/Way**’s uniform principle.

By this, the **Dao/Way** is known.
Observing through the **Dao/Way**,
The world has no contrary.

**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Profound Embrace of Virtue/Power**
The profound embrace of **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*)
Is seen in the **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*).

Poisonous insects do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not attack,
Snatching birds do not clutch.

Though bones are weak and sinews soft,
The grasp is firm.
Though unaware of male and female union,
The **命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*) is already formed—
This is the peak of **精** (*jīng* / *essence*).

All day it cries yet its throat never grows hoarse,
This is the peak of **和** (*hé* / *harmony*).

Knowing **和** (*hé* / *harmony*) is **常** (*cháng* / *constant*),
Knowing **常** (*cháng* / *constant*) is **明** (*míng* / *clarity*),
Adding to life is **祥** (*xiáng* / *omen*),
Forcing the **氣** (*qì* / *qi*) with the heart is **強** (*qiáng* / *force*).

When things grow robust, they grow old—
This is called **不道** (*bùdào* / *not the Dao/Way*),
And **不道** (*bùdào* / *not the Dao/Way*) perishes early.

The profound embrace of **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*)
Is the concealment and nurturing without display.
**厚** (*hòu* / *profound*) means **至** (*zhì* / *ultimate*).

When the embrace of **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) reaches its ultimate,
It is like the **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*).

Poisonous insects do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not attack,
Snatching birds do not clutch—
This means things cannot harm it,
Just as entering water does not wet it,
And entering fire does not burn it.

The **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*)’s bones are most frail,
Its sinews most tender,
Yet its grip is unyielding.

Though unaware of male and female union,
Its **命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*) is already formed—
Its **精** (*jīng* / *essence*) is abundant.

**命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*) is the **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*)’s original **命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*).

Though it cries all day,
Its throat never grows hoarse—
Its heart knows no joy nor anger,
Its **氣** (*qì* / *qi*) is naturally harmonious.

The throat is the **咽喉** (*yànhóu* / *pharynx/larynx*),
Hoarseness is **氣** (*qì* / *qi*) obstruction.

The **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*) is pure, singular, and unyielding,
Thus it can be so.
The **有道者** (*yǒudàozhě* / *Daoist*) is the same—
Only the heart does not move.

**和** (*hé* / *harmony*) is the preservation of pure **氣** (*qì* / *qi*).
Knowing this ultimate harmony,
One can endure constantly without change.
Knowing this constant endurance,
One can be said to be **明** (*míng* / *clear*) in the **Dao/Way**.

Life cannot be artificially enhanced,
Forcing such enhancement brings misfortune.
**祥** (*xiáng* / *omen*) is **妖** (*yāo* / *unnatural/portentous*).
Thus, it is said: *Adding to life is an omen.*

The **心** (*xīn* / *heart*) forces the **氣** (*qì* / *qi*)—
This is **志** (*zhì* / *aspiration*) moving the **氣** (*qì* / *qi*).
**強** (*qiáng* / *force*) means **暴** (*bào* / *brutality*).
Brutality is **不道** (*bùdào* / *not the Dao/Way*),
Thus, it is said: *Forcing the qi with the heart is force.*

By this as force,
Nothing remains unbroken—
Like things growing robust,
Nothing remains unaging.
This is not called the **Dao/Way**.

**早已** (*zǎoyǐ* / *early cessation*)—
Stop quickly and do not act.
**已** (*yǐ* / *cessation*) means **止** (*zhǐ* / *halt*).
These three lines have already appeared in **Chapter Thirty**.

**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Silent Sage**
The knowing do not speak,
The speaking do not know.

Plug its **兑** (*duì* / *mouth/joy*), close its **门** (*mén* / *gate*),
Dull its sharpness, untangle its confusion,
Harmonize its brightness, equalize its dust—
This is called **玄同** (*Xuándōng* / *Mysterious Oneness*).

It cannot be drawn near as intimate,
Nor pushed away as distant;
It cannot be claimed as beneficial,
Nor rejected as harmful.

「It cannot be esteemed as **noble** (*guì* / *honor*), nor despised as **base** (*jiàn* / *lowly*), hence it is **noble** for all under heaven.
The knowing do not speak, the speaking do not know—
This is said to mean the **Dao/Way** cannot be confined by words.

Again, plug its **兑** (*duì* / *mouth/joy*), close its **门** (*mén* / *gate*),
And conceal it in **密** (*mì* / *secrecy*).
It must dull its sharpness and **磨砻** (*móli* / *grind and polish it*),
So that it has no **圭角** (*guījiǎo* / *principled edges*).
It must untangle its **纷** (*fēn* / *chaos*) and **条理** (*tiáolǐ* / *order it*),
So that it does not **紊乱** (*wǎnluàn* / *be disordered*).
It must harmonize its brightness and equalize its dust—
Yet not **自眩露** (*zìxiànlù* / *self-aggrandize*).
This is called the **至玄** (*Zhìxuán* / *Supreme Mystery*),
The **至妙** (*Zhìmiào* / *Supreme Marvelousness*),
And the **同然而然** (*Tóngrán’rán* / *Oneness with natural spontaneity*) of **理** (*lǐ* / *principle*).

With this **Mysterious Oneness** of the **Dao/Way**,
All under heaven cannot be drawn near as intimate,
Nor pushed away as distant—
This is to say it transcends the bounds of near and far.
Hence, this is why the **Dao/Way** is **noble** for all under heaven.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing with Rectitude**
Governing with **rectitude** (*zhèng* / *uprightness, correctness*),
Employing **奇** (*qí* / *strategic guile, extraordinary tactics*) in warfare,
And seizing all under heaven through **无事** (*wúshì* / *non-action*).
How do I know this to be so?
By this.

For when all under heaven abounds in **忌讳** (*jìhuì* / *taboos and prohibitions*),
The people grow ever more **贫** (*pín* / *impoverished*).
When men proliferate **利器** (*lìqì* / *sharp/advantageous tools*),
The state becomes ever more **昏** (*hūn* / *corrupt, chaotic*).
When the people abound in **技巧** (*jìqiǎo* / *skills and craftiness*),
**奇物** (*qíwù* / *strange/artificial things*) proliferate.
When **法令** (*fǎlìng* / *laws and decrees*) become ever more **彰** (*zhāng* / *prominent, explicit*),
Thieves and robbers abound.
Therefore, the **圣人** (*shèngrén* / *Sage*) says:
*"I act with **无为** (*wúwéi* / *non-action*), yet the people transform themselves.
I love **静** (*jìng* / *tranquility*), yet the people rectify themselves.
I act with **无事** (*wúshì* / *non-action*), yet the people grow rich.
I have **无欲** (*wúyù* / *no desires*), yet the people return to **朴** (*pǔ* / *simplicity, naturalness*)."*

Governing with **rectitude** means
That when governing the state, one must have **政事** (*zhèngshì* / *government affairs*).
Employing **奇** in warfare means
That when waging war, one must rely on **诈术** (*zhàshù* / *deceitful strategies*).
Both of these are acts of **有心** (*yǒuxīn* / *deliberate intent*).
**无为** while still **为** (*wúwéi ér wéi* / *non-acting yet acting*),
Then one can attain the **心** (*xīn* / *loyalty*) of all under heaven—
Hence it is said: *"Seize all under heaven through **无事** (*wúshì* / *non-action*)."*

How do I know that **有心** (*yǒuxīn* / *deliberate intent*) is not acceptable,
Yet **无心** (*wúxīn* / *non-intent*) is?
By this **Dao/Way**.

「Taboos and prohibitions are a means of restraint.
**利器** (*lìqì* / *sharp/useful tools*) are for the practical convenience of the world.
**技巧** (*jìqiǎo* / *crafty skills*) are the artistry of artisans.
**奇物** (*qíwù* / *ingenious devices*)—such as the *juéjiāng* (shaduf) and mechanical contrivances—are of this kind.
Once **机心** (*jīxīn* / *scheming intent*) prevails,
**机事** (*jīshì* / *scheming undertakings*) multiply evermore.
Thus, the clearer the laws and decrees,
The more rampant the thieves and bandits become.
This illustrates the harm of **有心** (*yǒuxīn* / *deliberate intent*), all metaphorical speech.

Hence, the ancient **圣人** (*Shèngrén* / *Sages*) merely say:
*"Non-acting yet acting, preferring tranquility,
Non-action and no desires—
And all under heaven will govern itself."*

The Sage speaks again in the following chapter.
*"The chapter of **其政闷闷** (*qízhèng mènmèn* / *its governance is obscure and harmonious*)"*—the fifty-eighth:

*"Its governance is obscure and harmonious, its people are pure and content;
Its governance is meticulous and probing, its people are deficient and restless.
Disaster, oh, where fortune leans;
Fortune, oh, where disaster lurks.
Who knows their ultimate end,
That neither **正** (*zhèng* / *rectitude*) nor **邪** (*xié* / *crookedness*) can be fixed?
Rectitude may turn to **奇** (*qí* / *deceit*), goodness may turn to **妖** (*yāo* / *bewitching*).
The people’s confusion has long been set in motion.
Therefore, the Sage is square yet not sharp-edged,
Moderate yet not piercing,
Upright yet not overbearing,
Brilliant yet not dazzling.

**闷闷** (*mènmèn* / *obscure and harmonious*) means not to feign cleverness.
**察察** (*cháchá* / *meticulous and probing*) means excessive scrutiny and fragmentation.
**醇醇** (*chúnchún* / *pure and content*) is self-satisfaction.
**缺缺** (*quēquē* / *deficient and restless*) is lack and discontent.
This too conveys the meaning:
That **有心** (*deliberate intent*) brings harm,
While **无心** (*non-intent*) brings self-governance.

Disaster and fortune are without constancy,
Alternating in their reliance and concealment—
Who knows where their limits lie?
**正** (*zhèng* / *rectitude*) is constancy.
Yet what if there is no constancy?
It means that their reliance and concealment are endless,
And cannot be determined.

The affairs of all under heaven:
**奇** (*qí* / *deceit*) may become **正** (*rectitude*), **正** may become **奇**,
Goodness may become **妖** (*bewitching*), **妖** may become goodness—
Right and wrong, benefit and harm,
All are thus in constant flux.
This too is the meaning of disaster and fortune alternating.

The people are confused and do not realize,
Only blindly distinguishing between **奇** and **正**, between **妖** and goodness.
Their confusion is not of a single day’s making.

Only the Sage’s **Dao/Way** is thus:
Though square, it has no corners,
Though moderate, it does not pierce,
Though upright, it cannot be stretched,
Though brilliant, its radiance is not seen.
**割** (*gē* / *to cut/trim*), **削** (*xuē* / *to pare*)—without corners, there is nothing to trim.
**廉** (*lián* / *sharpness, edge*), the sharpness of distant lands—
Not to pierce means not to harm; sharpness and utility easily lead to injury.
**肆** (*sì* / *to extend*), **伸** (*shēn* / *to stretch*)—
Not to stretch means its uprightness is not apparent.
**耀** (*yào* / *to dazzle*), the flame of brilliance—
This is the meaning of concealing within the act of non-concealment.

*"The chapter of **治人事天** (*zhìrén shìtiān* / *governing people and serving the Dao/Way*)"*—the fifty-ninth:

*"To govern people and serve the Dao/Way,
Nothing surpasses **啬** (*sè* / *frugality, restraint*)."*

---

*"Now, **frugality** (*sè*) is the very reason for **early return** (*zǎo fù*), and **early return** is called **accumulating virtue/power** (*chóng jī dé*). To accumulate virtue/power means nothing cannot be overcome; nothing cannot be overcome means none can fathom its limits, and if none can fathom its limits, one can establish a state. The foundation of establishing a state, one can endure long and prosper. This is called the **Dao/Way of deep-rooted and firmly grounded** (*shēn gēn gù dì*) **enduring life and long vision** (*cháng shēng jiǔ shì*).

The **frugal** (*sè*) one holds **abundance without exhaustion** (*yǒu yú bù jìn yòng zhī yì*). Thus, they can **possess without holding** (*néng yǒu ér wú*), **be solid yet appear empty** (*néng shí ér xū*), making it fitting that they can **govern people** (*lián rén*) and **serve the Dao/Way** (*shì tiān*). **Early return** (*zǎo fù*) means **reverting to the root** (*guī fù yú gēn*). **Limit** (*jí*) is **early** (*zǎo*), **early** is **not distant** (*bù yuǎn*). **Return** (*fù*) is **reverting to the origin and restoring the fundamental** (*fǎn běn huán yuán*). When virtue/power reaches this stage, it grows ever more abundant and flourishing. **Accumulating** (*chóng*) means **ever-increasing accumulation** (*yù jī zhī yì*). **Overcome** (*kè*) means **capability** (*néng*). The more virtue/power flourishes, the more nothing is impossible in its application. If none can fathom its limits, it means **exhaustless use** (*yòng zhī bù qióng*). Exhaustless use means one can **establish a state** (*wéi guó*) and endure long.

**Foundation** (*mǔ*) means **nurturing** (*yǎng*). To nurture people with goodness is to **rule the world** (*fú tiānxià*). Thus, it is for **governing the state** (*zhì guó*), and likewise for **nurturing life** (*yǎng shēng*). If one can nurture life with **harmony** (*yīn*), then they can **deepen its roots** (*shēn qí gēn*), **ground its foundation** (*gù qí dì*), achieve **enduring life** (*cháng shēng*), and attain **long vision** (*jiǔ shì*). **Roots and foundation** (*gēn dì*) are the **source of primordial qi** (*yuán qì zhī mǔ*). **Long vision** (*jiǔ shì*) means **unfaltering spirit** (*jīngshén quán kě jiǔ shì ér bù shùn*).

Now, those who **cultivate qi** (*fú qì*) may possess such techniques, though not the learning of **Laozi** (*Lǎozi*), yet they can **verify the words of Laozi** (*kě yàn Lǎozi zhī yán*). This chapter uses **governing the state** (*zhì guó*) as an analogy for **nurturing life** (*yǎng shēng*).

---
*"The chapter of **governing a great state** (*zhì dà guó*)—the sixtieth:*

**Governing a great state** is like **poaching a small fish** (*rú pēng xiǎo xiān*). To rule the world with the **Dao/Way** (*yǐ Dào lì tiānxià*), its **spirits** (*guǐ*) are not **divine** (*shén*). Not that its spirits are not divine, but that the divine does not harm people. Not that the divine does not harm people, but that the **Sage** (*shèngrén*) also does not harm. Both **not harming each other** (*liǎng bù xiāng shāng*), thus their virtue/power **returns and intermingles** (*dé jiāo guī fǎn*).

This chapter first **emphatically states** (*xiān dùn yī jù*) a sentence, to express the meaning of **not disturbing** (*ān jìng bù rǎo*). **Poaching a small fish** means **stirring it breaks** (*jiǎo zhī zé suì*). For **governing the state**, **disturbing it causes chaos** (*rǎo zhī zé luàn*). **Purity, tranquility, and non-action** (*qīngjìng wúwéi, ānjìng bùrǎo*), this is the **Dao/Way of governing the state** (*zhì guó zhī Dào*).

Having introduced this meaning in the first sentence, the following discusses the **Dao/Way of the Three Talents** (*sān cái zhī Dào*), all of which revolve around **not disturbing** (*bù rǎo*). To rule the world with the **Dao/Way** (*yǐ Dào lì tiānxià*), this **world** (*tiānxià*) encompasses the **Three Talents** (*sān cái*). All beneath the **Great Void** (*Tài xū*), governed by the **Dao/Way**, the **Heaven** (*tiān*) fulfills its role of **covering** (*fù*), the **Earth** (*dì*) fulfills its role of **bearing** (*zài*), and the **Sage** fulfills their role of **teaching** (*jiào*). The three each fulfill their duties without encroaching upon one another, thus all attain their **Dao/Way** (*dé qí Dào*).

**Spirits** (*shén*) are **yang** (*yáng*); **ghosts** (*guǐ*) are **yin** (*yīn*). Though it does not say **yin-yang** (*yīn yáng*) but **spirits and ghosts** (*shén guǐ*), this aligns with the **authentic intent of the text’s composition** (*zhèng qí zhuó shū lì zhī yì*), not desiring full revelation. When it says **its ghosts are not divine** (*qí guǐ bù shén*), it means the **Earth** abides by **yin** yet does not interfere with **yang**. Not that its ghosts are not divine, but that the **divine** (*shén*) of the **Heaven** does not harm people. Not that the divine does not harm people, but that the **Earth** exhausts its own **Dao/Way** (*dì jìn dì zhī Dào*) without interfering with **Heaven**, while **Heaven** exhausts its own **Dao/Way** (*tiān jìn tiān zhī Dào*) without interfering with people, hence it is said **the divine does not harm people** (*qí shén bù shāng rén*).

Not that the divine does not harm people, but that **Heaven** exhausts its own **Dao/Way** without interfering with people; the **Sage** also exhausts their own **Dao/Way** without interfering with **Heaven and Earth**. The **mysterious** (*yōu*) becomes **yin-yang**, the **manifest** (*míng*) becomes **Sage and governance** (*shèng zhì*). These two do not harm each other, thus their virtue/power **returns and intermingles** (*jiāo guī zhī*).

It is said that **Heaven and Earth attain the natural Dao/Way** (*tiān dì dé zìrán zhī Dào*), the **Sage** also attains the natural **Dao/Way** (*shèngrén yì dé zìrán zhī Dào*), each possessing their own virtue/power without encroaching, hence it is said **virtue/power returns and intermingles** (*jiāo guī zhī*). **Not harming each other** (*bù xiāng shāng*) means **not encroaching** (*bù xiāng qīn*), and the **Sage** also does not harm. The following line mistakenly adds an extra **people** (*mín*) character—an error. The **Commentary on the Daoist Classic of Virtue and Dao/Way** (*Dàodé Zhēn Jīng Kǒuyì*) concludes here in the third volume.

**Chapter 61: The Great State as the Lowly Stream**

The great state is the lowly stream of the world,
the meeting place of all under Heaven,
the receptive mother of all under Heaven.

The receptive always overcomes the assertive by stillness,
and stillness is the way of the lowly.

Thus, when the great state yields to the small state, it takes the small state;
when the small state yields to the great state, it takes the great state.
Hence, sometimes yielding brings conquest,
sometimes yielding brings possession.

The great state seeks only to nurture all people,
the small state seeks only to serve others.
When both attain what they desire,
the great state ought to be lowly.

This chapter uses the great and small states attaining their desires
to illustrate that those who know the Dao should be humble and still—
not teaching that one should yield to gain victory.

Since the Three Dynasties onward, there have been instances of states taking others,
this metaphor is drawn from what was observed.

*"Lowly stream"* means to place oneself in humility.
If the people of the great state can humble themselves,
they can unite the world’s alliances,
just as the receptive overcomes the assertive through stillness.

Those who yield take stillness as their Dao,
hence it is said, *"stillness is the way of the lowly."*

*"Taking by yielding"* and *"possessing by yielding"*—
these two phrases are also uniquely expressed.

The intent of the great state is merely to nurture all people for strength,
while the small state seeks only to carve and inscribe itself into others.
Both must yield to achieve their desires,
and only by yielding can both attain what they seek.

Thus, those who know the Dao must indeed find humility fitting.

This sentence concludes the chapter,
its meaning simply that the strong must become weak,
the possessing must become empty—
only then do they know the Dao.

The entire book’s intent is thus expressed in every chapter,
yet commentators often mistake the metaphors for literal instruction,
which is why Master Huī’ān criticized Laozi’s doctrine of laborious exertion.

Only Master Huáng Màocái’s interpretation states:
*"This entire chapter is a metaphor illustrating the Dao."*
This is most accurate,
though it cannot be universally applied to other chapters,
and thus has its limitations.

**Chapter 62: The Dao as the Hidden Mystery of All Things**

The Dao is the hidden mystery of all things,
the treasure of the virtuous,
the refuge of the unvirtuous.

Fine words can be sold in the marketplace,
noble conduct can elevate one above others.
How could one abandon those who are unvirtuous?
Thus, when establishing a Son of Heaven or appointing the Three Ministers,
even if one offers a jade tablet before fine steeds,
it is not as good as humbly presenting this Dao.

Why did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?
Was it not because seeking it brings attainment,
and virtue can avert guilt?

Thus, it is the most precious under Heaven.

*"The Dao is the hidden mystery of all things"*—
this opening line praises it.

What follows speaks of the Dao being present in all under Heaven,
in both the wise and the foolish.
For the virtuous, those who know the Dao cherish and treasure it.
For the unvirtuous, those who know the Dao also shelter and embrace them.
This is the meaning of *"nurturing the unbalanced with the balanced."*

*"Marketplace"* refers to transactions where people exchange goods for mutual benefit,
yet even here, fine words can bring delight.
If a village has even one person worthy of respect,
others will naturally honor and elevate them.

From this, it is clear that this inherent goodness
is never absent from the world.

Then, how could those who know the Dao abandon the unvirtuous?
*"Fine words can be sold"*—*"sold"* here means self-promotion,
as when apothecaries advertise *"no deception, broad benevolence."*
*"Noble conduct can elevate one above others"*—
in villages, whether one is long-suffering or kind,
their neighbors will not fail to honor them.

These two lines mean even ordinary people
do not fail to recognize the Dao’s goodness.

*"Offering a jade tablet before fine steeds"*—
this is the ritual for recruiting the worthy.
With humble words and generous gifts to seek the virtuous,
and place them in the Three Ministerial ranks,
it is still not as good as humbly presenting this Dao.

Moreover, why did the ancients value this Dao so highly?
Seeking it brings attainment—
the Dao lies within oneself; virtue depends on oneself, not others.
Even those with guilt can be pardoned by a single virtuous thought.
Even the wicked, through fasting, bathing, and ritual purity,
can serve the Divine.

*"Was it not because..."*—
as if to say, *"Does not the Classic of Poetry not say..."*
The Dao is not limited to the wise or foolish;
enlightenment brings attainment—
this is why it is so precious under Heaven.

**Chapter 63: Acting Without Acting**

Act without acting,
do without doing,
taste without tasting.

Great and small, many and few.
Repay resentment with virtue.
Plan the difficult while it is easy,
achieve the great while it is small.

The world’s difficult tasks must begin with ease,
the world’s great tasks must begin with minutiae.
Thus, the Sage never acts with grandiosity,
and so achieves the great.

Light promises bring few fulfillments,
many easy tasks bring many difficulties.
Thus, the Sage treats even these with caution,
and so never faces true difficulty.

Only by *not* acting can one achieve *all* things,
hence it is said, *"Act without acting."*

Only by *not* doing in doing can one gather true accomplishment,
hence it is said, *"Do without doing."*

Only by *not* clinging to taste can one truly know flavor,
hence it is said, *"Taste without tasting."*

Those who can achieve the great must also achieve the small,
those who can achieve the many must also achieve the few,
those who repay resentment must do so with virtue,
those who plan the difficult must first address the easy,
those who achieve the great must first address the minute.

From *"taste without tasting"* onward, these are all metaphors.

*"Difficult tasks must begin with ease, great tasks with minutiae"*—
this merely elaborates the preceding intent.

The Sage does not exalt themselves,
yet through humility and lowliness,
they achieve the great.

Those who make light promises often overcommit,
leading to broken trust.
Those who treat tasks as easy often find them difficult to complete.
Thus, the Sage treats even these with caution,
and so never faces true difficulty.

---

This is also a metaphorical expression, but by adding the word *"husband"* (夫), its meaning shifts again.
Earlier, it spoke of *"ease"* (易), lest people regard it with a casual or frivolous mindset.
Thus, it turns the phrase to say *"easy"* (易), not meaning *"light"* or *"frivolous"* (轻易).
The Sage still treats matters as if they were difficult,
and so never encounters true difficulty—what of others?

The intent here is that *"ease"* (易) refers to effortless action,
not to what is casually or lightly undertaken.

**Chapter Sixty-Four: The Ease of Non-Action**
When it is yet tranquil, it is easy to hold;
When its signs are not yet evident, it is easy to plan;
When it is yet fragile, it is easy to break;
When it is yet subtle, it is easy to disperse.

Act before things manifest,
govern before chaos arises.

A tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout;
A nine-tiered tower begins with a single basket of earth;
A journey of a thousand *li* starts beneath one’s feet.

Doers bring ruin,
Graspers lose their hold.

The Sage does not act,
Thus there is no ruin;
The Sage does not grasp,
Thus there is no loss.

When the people undertake tasks,
They often falter just as success is near.
If one treats the end with the same care as the beginning,
There will be no ruined undertakings.

Thus, the Sage desires what others do not desire,
And does not value what others prize as rare.
They learn without learning,
And correct what others overlook—
To aid the natural unfolding of all things,
Yet they dare not act.

In times of peace, it is easy to hold firm;
When danger comes, it is hard to maintain.

Before a matter sprouts, it is easy to plan;
Once it takes shape, it is hard to strategize.

When it is still fragile, it is easy to shatter;
Once it has hardened, it is hard to attack.

When its path is yet faint, it is easy to disperse;
When it flourishes, it is hard to scatter.

Act before things exist,
Govern before chaos arises.

A tree thick enough to embrace—
Its growth begins from the smallest sprout;
A nine-tiered tower—
Its construction starts with a single basket of earth;
A thousand-*li* journey—
It begins with the first step.

All these points speak of those who study the Dao
Must know the critical moment (*jī* 几).
This *jī* 几 has both refined and coarse aspects—
The thirteenth of a month is also *jī* 几,
The beginning before beginnings is also *jī* 几,
The natural state of things is also *jī* 几.

Yet when one acts or clings,
Signs become evident—
Thus it is said: *"Doers bring ruin, graspers lose their hold."*

The Sage acts by not acting,
Clings by not clinging—
Thus they know no ruin, no loss.

Ordinary people, in their dealings with this world,
Have tasks that hold promise of success,
Yet they ruin them—
They do not perceive the critical moment (*jī* 几),
But fixate on its outward traces.

If one does not seek the end of a matter,
But instead exercises caution at its beginning,
There will be no ruined undertakings.

What others do not desire,
The Sage desires;
What others prize as rare,
The Sage does not prize.

Hard-to-obtain treasures are but metaphorical speech.
What the multitude does not study, the Sage studies;
What the multitude passes by without heeding, the Sage turns back to examine.
*Fu* 复 is *fan* 反—this too is metaphorical speech.

The Sage acts thus in all things,
With a heart that dares not act,
Only then can they assist the natural unfolding of all things.

**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Ancient Masters of the Dao**
The ancient masters of the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people,
But rather to make them simple.
The people are hard to govern because their cleverness is excessive.
To govern with cleverness is the ruin of the state;
To govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.
Knowing these two principles is the model.
To know this model is called *Xuan De* 玄德—
Profound and distant, contrary to things, yet reaching *Da Shun* 大顺.

Keen intelligence is a burden of the Dao.
The Sage’s teaching of others always seeks to dim their brilliance,
Lest they burden themselves—
Thus it is said: *"Not to enlighten the people, but to make them simple."*

The character *yu* 愚 is ill-placed here—
Qin’s deception of the common folk stems from this error.
Hence, Master Hui’s critique of it as *lao rang* 劳攘.

When cleverness and skill abound, the people grow harder to govern.
Thus, governing with cleverness becomes the state’s undoing.
For when rulers and subjects alike rely on cunning,
Chaos takes root—
Hence: *"To govern with cleverness is the ruin of the state;
To govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing."*

These two refer to wisdom and its absence.
To know that cleverness is ruinous and simplicity is blessing—
This too can serve as a law for the world.
To grasp this law is to possess *Xuan Miao* 玄妙’s virtue.

*"Profound and distant"*—words of exaggerated praise.
*Fan* 反 is *fu* 复—
To reverse and restore with all things, seeking their origin,
Is to return to *Da Shun*, the great harmony—
*Harmony* being *naturalness* itself.

**Chapter Sixty-Six: The King of All Valleys**
The rivers and seas become kings of all valleys
Because they excel in humility—
Thus they reign as kings of all valleys.

Therefore, the Sage who would lead the people
Must speak to them in humility;
Who would go before the people
Must place themselves last.

Thus, the Sage stands above yet the people do not feel burdened,
Goes before yet the people do not feel harmed.
Thus, all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion.

Because they do not contend,
None under heaven can contend with them.

All valley waters converge at the rivers and seas.
Though the rivers and seas are exalted over all valleys,
They dwell beneath them—
This is a metaphor drawn from things.
The self-humiliated are exalted by others,
The self-last are honored as first.

To speak in humility—
As when one says, *"Even a foolish man and woman can surpass me."*
To place oneself last—
As when one defers to the multitude, following others.

The Sage does not boast of leading the people,
Nor does He seek to go before them—
Rather, this is His way.

The intent is: Even the Sage, though desiring to lead and go first,
Still acts thus—
How much more so others?
The phrasing is slightly exaggerated in its emphasis.

Though the Sage stands above all under heaven,
The people do not feel oppressed.
Though He goes before all under heaven,
The people do not feel harmed.
All under heaven gladly follow without weariness,
For the Sage follows the Way of non-contention—
Thus none under heaven can contend with Him.

*"Not burdened"* means *"not weary"*—
Three *"is with"* clauses, as in the *Systematic Classic*’s repeated *"is because."*

**Chapter Sixty-Seven: All Under Heaven Speaks**
All under heaven says, *"He is great yet seems unworthy."*
Only because He is great does He seem unworthy.
If He were worthy for long, He would be petty.

I possess three treasures—treasures to hold:
First, *ci* 慈—compassion;
Second, *jian* 俭—frugality;
Third, *not daring to lead all under heaven.*

Compassion makes one courageous,
Frugality makes one expansive,
Not daring to lead all under heaven makes one the vessel and leader.

Now, abandon compassion yet cling to courage,
Abandon frugality yet cling to expansion,
Abandon lastness yet cling to first—
This is death.

Compassion in war brings victory,
In defense brings security.
When Heaven would save them, it shields them with compassion.

*"Great yet seems unworthy"*—this was a saying of the time,
Thus Laozi cites it as metaphor, echoing the earlier *"barren valleys, orphans, widows."*

*"All under heaven says"*—meaning this was a common phrase of the age.

Only because He is *great* does He seem unworthy—
The most exalted must act with the most humble heart.
*Xiao* 肖 is *xiang* 象—
Seemingly without likeness, yet embodying the small.

If one fancies themselves likened to anything,
They are petty, not of great measure.

These two lines clarify Laozi’s intent through contemporary speech.
One manuscript adds *"dao"* 道 after *"predicates me"* and *"also"* 也 after *"petty,"*—both errors.

The *three treasures*—their Way is precious and to be employed.
*"I possess"*—what is noble in oneself.
Only compassion makes one courageous,
Only frugality makes one expansive,
Only not daring to lead makes one the leader of all under heaven.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *"The Duke of Jin was expansive yet frugal."*
This directly applies the phrase.

*Lian* 涟 is to gather the enemy,
*Guang* 广 is to open and unfettered—
Also the meaning of *"smallness precedes greatness."*

*Qi* 器 is form—*cheng qi* 成器 is to take form.
All formed things on earth, I make their leader—
Thus: *"to make form and lead."*

Now, if one abandons compassion yet uses courage,
Abandons frugality yet uses expansion,
Abandons lastness yet uses first—
This is not the way to preserve oneself—
Thus: *"Death."*

*War* is to engage and move—
As Zhuangzi says: *"To clash and contend, daily battling with the heart."*
*Defense* is as Zhuangzi’s *"pure qi guarding."*
If one takes compassion as master,
Externally they can overcome things,
Internally they can guard themselves—
Thus: *"In war, they win; in defense, they hold firm."*

「Rescue, *yòu* 佑 is to assist and protect.
Defense, *wèi* 卫 is to guard oneself.
If one defends with compassion, Heaven aids them.
This language is subtle, bearing a rebuke for those today who cannot [do so].

The capable are guided by Heaven’s *zhōng* 诱#2 [intuition],
While the incapable are deprived of Heaven’s oversight.

Earlier, the Three Treasures were mentioned—here, one [treasure] is raised:
If one is compassionate, the other two are inherent within.

**Chapter 68: The Virtuous Warrior**
The virtuous warrior is not martial,
The skilled fighter does not rage,
The skilled victor does not contend,
The skilled leader places others *below* them.

This is called the *virtue of non-contention*,
This is called the *strength of using others*,
This is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—the ancient pinnacle.

*Shì* 士 are officers of the *shīshī* 士师 [ritual masters].
*Wǔ* 武 means "vigorous officials."
To establish *shì* with clear laws—why employ martial vigor?
To fight while enraged is to provoke the soldiers.
"Not to contend" means not to oppose things directly.
To "place others below" echoes the earlier meaning of "taking from the lowly to enrich the state."

The excellence of these four lies in the metaphor of non-contention.
The *virtue of non-contention* can harmonize with Heaven,
Can bend collective strength to govern the world—
From ancient times, nothing surpasses this, hence: *"the ancient pinnacle."*

**Chapter 69: The Art of War’s Sayings**
The art of war has sayings:
*"I dare not take the offensive but yield the initiative,
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."*

This is called *"moving without moving,"*
*"Seizing without arms,"*
*"Defeating without resistance,"*
*"Grasping without weapons."*

No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—
Underestimating the enemy nearly loses one’s Treasures.
Thus, when armies clash, the first to engage wins.

Those who speak of war’s art also cite contemporary sayings as metaphor.
The warrior does not dare take the offensive but yields the initiative,
Values retreat over advance,
Makes "non-action" into action,
Makes "non-seizing" into seizing,
Makes "no resistance" into resistance,
Makes "no weapons" into weapons—
All are stratagems of feigning cowardice and weakness to deceive the enemy.

*Rén* 仍 means "to lure"—to lure the enemy into battle.
Thus, such warfare holds the path to victory.
If one underestimates the enemy in arrogance, defeat is inevitable.
Non-contention preserves the Treasures,
But underestimating the enemy to seek victory loses them.

Thus, when two warring states clash,
The side that *pities* (哀) always prevails.
*Pity* means solemnly not rejoicing in war.
Drums clash, soldiers leap into battle—
This is not *pity*.

This chapter entirely uses warfare to illustrate the *Dao*.
By extension, all such metaphors in the text follow this pattern.

**Chapter 70: My Words Are Most Obvious**
My words are most obvious, most easy to act upon.
Yet none in the world can know them, none can follow them.
Speech has its *master* (宗),
Affairs have their *lord* (君).

Only the ignorant fail to recognize me.
Few know me, so I am honored.
Thus, the Sage wears coarse cloth while treasuring jade.

My words are most obvious, most easy to act upon,
Yet none in the world knows or follows them—
This is the world’s deception in not recognizing itself.

*Zōng* 宗 is "master," *jūn* 君 is also "lord."
Among all speech, some words are supreme—hence, *"speech has its master."*
All affairs under Heaven are governed by the *Dao*—hence, *"affairs have their lord."*

Since the world lacks those who know supreme speech and the *Dao*,
None recognize me—hence, *"Only the ignorant fail to recognize me."*
Having said the world does not know me,
Yet *"Few know me, so I am honored"*—
This echoes the earlier meaning: *"The unsmiled-upon is the *Dao*."*

The Sage’s *Dao* suffices within yet does not manifest externally—
Like wearing coarse cloth while cherishing jade,
So none can see it.

**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**
To know the unknown is superior,
To not know the known is sickness.
Only by treating sickness as sickness
Does one not fall ill.

The Sage does not fall ill
Because they treat knowing as sickness—
Thus, they do not fall ill.

At the peak of knowledge, yet appearing ignorant—
This is the *Dao*’s summit.

In the unknowable, yet assuming knowledge—
This is the sickness of learning the *Dao*.

If one treats their knowing as sickness,
This sickness will vanish.

The Sage’s immunity to sickness lies in
Recognizing knowing as sickness and treating it as such.

*[Note: Some manuscripts incorrectly add "矣" to the first sentence—an error.]*

**Chapter 72: The People Fear Not Authority**
When the people fear not authority, *great authority* has arrived.
Do not narrow their dwelling,
Do not exhaust their sustenance.

Only by not exhausting does one not exhaust.
Thus, the Sage knows themselves yet does not reveal themselves,
Loves themselves yet does not exalt themselves—
Hence, they discard the former to embrace this.

*"Those who do not fear punishment always meet it"*—
The opening words are metaphor.

*Jū* 居 means "broad dwelling."
*Shēng* 生 refers to the principle of longevity and vitality.
All narrow their dwellings, exhaust their sustenance—
Unsettled in retreat yet obsessed with advancement,
Unaware of emptiness yet bewildered by possession—
This is self-narrowing, self-exhausting.

*"Without"* is a cautionary admonition: *"Only this is possible."*
Only those who do not exhaust endure—
Hence, *"Thus, only by not exhausting does one not exhaust"*—
A deduction from the following sentence.

Though the Sage knows the *Dao*, they do not reveal it,
Yet they can obscure it.
Though they love themselves, they do not exalt themselves,
Yet they can be humble and lowly.

To "discard" is to abandon the commoners’ narrow, exhausting hearts,
To "take" is to suffice in this *Dao*—
Hence, *"take this."*

**Chapter 73: Boldness in Daring**
Boldness in daring leads to killing,
Boldness in *not* daring leads to life.
These two differ—one beneficial, one harmful.
What Heaven abhors, who knows its reason?

Thus, the Sage finds this difficult.

**The Way of Heaven**

The Way of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs,
Does not speak yet responds with grace,
Does not summon yet comes of its own accord,
Open and simple yet masterfully plans.

The Heavenly Net is vast and wide,
Though sparse, it loses nothing.

The bold in daring will surely harm themselves.
To face matters with fear is to be bold in *not* daring.
Life is preserved by self-preservation.

The harm of daring, the benefit of restraint—
These two are clearly distinct.

Heaven abhors excess and favors humility,
Thus, the bold in daring are not only despised by men,
But also by Heaven.

Yet the world’s people do not know this—
Hence, *"Who knows its reason?"*
A deception of those who do not know.

The Sage finds this difficult,
For even the Sage regards this Way as rare and arduous.

Heaven, by not contending, lets nothing escape its reach;
Heaven, by not speaking, yet holds the principle of response.
The interplay of yin and yang comes without being summoned.

*"Open"* means simplicity.
The *Qian* (Heaven) is known by its ease,
The *Kun* (Earth) by its capacity—
This is the meaning of *"open and masterfully plans."*

The Way of Heaven is vast, like a net,
Though wide and sparse, it misses nothing—
Speaking of good and evil, fortune and misfortune,
No thread escapes its decree.

Though the Sage acts without contention,
Yet right and wrong, good and bad—
Not a hair’s breadth may be disordered.

These lines again liken Heaven to the Way.

---
**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**

If the people do not fear death,
How can you frighten them with fear?

If you make the people always fear death,
And those who act strangely—
I seize them and kill them—
Who would dare?

There are always those entrusted with killing who kill.
To take the place of those entrusted with killing is like
A substitute carpenter taking the chisel.

A substitute carpenter rarely avoids injury to his hands.

This chapter speaks of distinguishing good and evil.
Self-made preferences, carried to extremes,
Are not the Way of knowing—
Hence, it uses those who wield punishment as an analogy.

Those who govern rely only on death to frighten the people,
Yet the people do not truly fear death.
If the people truly feared death,
Then those who act strangely—
I seize and punish them—
Then none would dare.

Yet those who act strangely are still killed,
And the people who transgress multiply—
Thus, the people do not truly fear death.

Those entrusted with killing are the Creators.
Between Heaven and Earth, those who do good or evil,
There are always Creators who hold sway over life and death.
Those who should be killed are killed by the Creators themselves—
Hence, *"There are always those entrusted with killing who kill."*

For a state to be overly concerned with punishment
Is to take the place of the Creators in killing.
With my clumsy hands replacing the Master Carpenter,
Few escape uninjured—
This is a metaphor within a metaphor.

This chapter also arises from the times’ fondness for killing,
Yet its intent is not to abolish punishment entirely.

Heaven punishes the guilty—
Only when there is no room for mercy.

---
**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**

The people’s hunger stems from their rulers taking too much in taxes.
The people’s difficulty in governing stems from their rulers’ excessive actions.
The people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive pursuit of life—
Thus, those who do not make life their concern
Are wiser than those who prize life.

*"Too much in taxes"* means taking excessively from the people.
*"Their rulers’ excessive actions"* means those who govern overuse clever schemes.
When rulers value profit, the people grow hungrier;
When rulers favor cleverness, the people grow harder to govern—
These two lines are also metaphors.

Generally, when people overindulge in self-preservation,
They risk losing their lives.
Excessive eating and drinking can bring illness—
This is one example.

Overindulging in self-care to secure life—
Hence, *"excessive pursuit of life."*
To recklessly risk one’s life to gain it—
Hence, *"disregard for death."*

To forget the self is to preserve the self—
Hence, *"those who do not make life their concern
Are wiser than those who prize life."*

*"Prize life"* is like the previous chapter’s *"increase life"*—
Those who excessively pursue life.
*"Wiser"* means *"superior."*

---
**Chapter 76: The Nature of Life**

When people are born, they are soft and weak;
When they die, they become stiff and strong.
All things—grasses and trees—
When born, are soft and brittle;
When dead, wither and decay.

Thus, the stiff and strong belong to death,
The soft and weak belong to life.
Hence, strong armies do not conquer,
Strong trees are felled.

The strong are low, the weak are high.
*"Soft and weak," "stiff and strong"*—
Both are metaphors.

Laozi’s teachings emphasize valuing the soft,
Thus, he uses the birth and death of people and plants as analogies.

*"Belong to"* means *"of the same kind."*
From *"Hence"* onward, he again uses armies and trees as metaphors.

Armies that rely on strength will not conquer;
Young trees are soft, but over time they grow stiff—
By the time they reach the thickness of a man’s arms,
They are near decay.

Thus, those who know the Way prize the soft and weak,
And regard the stiff and strong as inferior.

*"Felled"* refers to the felled tree’s curve.

---
**Chapter 77: The Way of Heaven**

Is not the Way of Heaven like drawing a bow?

The high are lowered, the low are raised,
The excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.
Heaven’s Way diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,
But the Way of man is otherwise—
They diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.

Who can serve the world with what is excessive?
Only those who follow the Way—
Hence, the Sage acts without claiming,
Completes without dwelling,
And does not desire to be seen as virtuous.

Heaven’s Way abhors excess and favors humility,
Like a drawn bow—
If held too long, it must slacken.

The high must inevitably humble themselves,
The excessive must inevitably diminish,
The low must inevitably rise,
The bent must inevitably straighten,
The diminished must inevitably be replenished—
Thus, Heaven treats all things in this manner.

「而人之为道，何为而不然，乃欲损人而益己；
Yet in the Way of man, why must it be otherwise?—
They seek to diminish others to enrich themselves.

不足，而为一己之有余；
The deficient, they make into their own excess.

唯有道之人，乃能损我之有余以奉天下；
Only those who follow the Dao can diminish my own excess
To serve the world.

故曰孰能有余以奉天下，惟有道者。」
Hence it is said: Who can have excess to serve the world?
Only those who follow the Dao.

《易》言损益，亦是此意，此亦借以喻道也。
The *I Ching* speaks of diminishing and supplementing—
This too is the same meaning, a metaphor borrowed to illustrate the Dao.

圣人所以虽有为於天下，而不以自恃，
The Sage acts in the world yet does not rely on himself—
虽功成而不居其功，
Though his deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell on them,
虽有至贤之行，而不欲以此自见。
Though he possesses the most virtuous conduct,
He does not wish to be seen as virtuous.

此为道日损，必至於损之而又损也。
This is the Dao of daily diminishing—
It must reach the point of diminishing even the diminished.

**天下柔弱章第七十八**
**Chapter 78: The World’s Gentleness and Weakness**

天下柔弱莫过於水，
In the world, nothing is as gentle and weak as water—
而攻坚强者莫之能胜，
Yet in overcoming the hard and strong,
None can surpass it—
其无以易之。
Its power cannot be replaced.

弱之胜强，柔之胜刚，
The weak overcome the strong,
The gentle overcome the rigid—
天下莫不知，
All under Heaven know this—
莫能行。
Yet none can practice it.

故圣人云：
Thus the Sage says:
受国之垢，是谓社稷主；
*"Bear the world’s filth, and you may be called the Lord of the Soil and Grain."*
受国之不祥，是谓天下王。
*"Bear the world’s misfortunes, and you may be called the King of the World."*

正言若反。
This is inverted speech.

水为至弱，而能攻坚强，
Water is the most weak,
Yet it can overcome the hard and strong—
世未有能胜之者。
No one in the world can surpass it.

千金之堤，败於蚁穴之漏，
A thousand-gold dam is ruined by a leak at the ant’s hole—
是弱之胜强者。
This is the weak overcoming the strong.

无以易於水也，
None can replace water—
故曰其无以易之。
Hence it is said: Its power cannot be replaced.

弱能胜强，柔能胜刚，
The weak can overcome the strong,
The gentle can overcome the rigid—
如水之易见，
As clear as water—
人莫不知之。
Yet none know how to do it.

而至道在於能柔能弱者，
The ultimate Dao lies in those who can be gentle and weak—
莫之能行也，
Yet none can practice it—
故古之圣人常有言曰：
Thus the ancient Sages often say:
能受一国之垢者，方可为社稷主，
*"Only those who can bear a nation’s filth
May become its Lord of Soil and Grain."*
能受一国之不祥者，方可为天下王。
*"Only those who can bear a nation’s misfortunes
May become the King of the World."*

此即知其荣，守其辱之意。
This is the meaning of *"knowing its glory yet holding to its shame."*

不祥者，不美之名也。
*"Misfortune"* is the name for what is not beautiful.

盖位至高者，不可与天下求胜，
For those in the highest position,
They cannot vie with the world for victory—
须能忍辱，则可以居人之上。
They must endure shame,
Then they may stand above others.

垢与不祥，不可受之受也，
To bear filth and misfortune
Is not the kind of bearing others speak of—
似反一世之常言，
It seems contrary to the common speech of the age—
其实正论，
Yet it is true doctrine—
故曰正言若反。
Hence it is said: This is inverted speech.

圣人云三字自佳，
The Sage’s three words are excellent—
一本以云为言误也。
But the original text mistakenly used *"cloud"* instead of *"say."*

**和大怨章第七十九**
**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**

和大怨，必有余怨，
To reconcile great grievances
Must inevitably leave lingering grievances—
安可以为善？
How can this be called good?

是以圣人执左契，
Thus the Sage holds onto the left contract—
而不责於人。
Yet does not demand it of others.

有德司契，无德司彻。
The virtuous govern the contract,
The lacking govern the clarity.

天道无亲，常与善人。
Heaven’s Way has no favorites—
It always aids the virtuous.

恩怨两忘，方知至道。
Only when one forgets both kindness and grievances
Does one truly know the ultimate Dao.

人有大怨於我，
When others hold great grievances against me—
而必欲与之和，
Yet I must desire to reconcile with them—
虽无执怨之心，
Though I have no lingering resentment—
犹知怨之为怨，
I still recognize grievance as grievance—
则此心亦未化矣。
Then this heart has not yet been transformed.

虽曰能与之和，
Though I say I can reconcile with them—
此心未化，
This heart has not yet been transformed—
则余怨尚在，
So lingering grievances still remain—
安得谓之善道，
How can this be called the Good Way?
此诚至理之言，亦借喻也。
This is indeed a profound truth, a metaphor as well.

左契者，
The left contract—
如今人合同文字也，
Like today’s written agreements—
一人得左，一人得右，
One party keeps the left half, the other the right—
故曰左契。
Hence it is called the left contract.

此契在我，
If this contract is with me—
则其物必可索，
Then I can demand its fulfillment—
圣人虽执此契，
Yet the Sage, though holding this contract—
而不以索於人，
Does not demand it of others—
忘而化也，
Forgetting and transforming it—
此亦借喻之语。
This too is metaphorical speech.

有德者则司主此契而无求索之心，
The virtuous govern the contract
Yet have no desire to demand its fulfillment—
无德者则以明白为主。
The lacking use clarity as their guide.

彻，明也，
*"Clarity"* means clarity—
犹今人言必与之讨分晓也。
Like how people today say they must demand an explanation.

有德司契者，善人也。
Those who govern the contract with virtue are good people.

天虽无私亲，而此等有德之人，
Though Heaven has no partial favorites,
Yet these virtuous people—
天必佑之，
Heaven will surely protect them—
故曰常与善人。
Hence it is said: Heaven always aids the virtuous.

**小国寡民章第八十**
**Chapter 80: Small States and Few People**

小国寡民，
Small states, few people—
使有什伯人之器而不用，
Let them possess the tools of a hundred men yet not use them—
使民重死而不远徙。
Let them value death over distant migration.

虽有舟舆，无所乘之；
Though they have boats and carriages,
They do not ride them—
虽有甲兵，无所陈之；
Though they have armor and weapons,
They do not display them—
使民复结绳而用之。
Let them return to using knotted cords.

甘其食，美其服，
Let them find their food sweet,
Their clothing beautiful—
安其居，乐其俗。
Their dwellings secure,
Their customs delightful.

邻国相望，鸡狗之声相闻，
Neighboring states are visible,
The sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—
民至老死不相往来。
Yet the people do not visit one another
Even until old age and death.

小国寡民，
Small states, few people—
犹孟子言得百里之地，皆可以朝诸侯，
Like Mencius saying: *"With a hundred-li territory,
One can attend the feudal lords"*—
一天下之意。
Or rule the world.

老子盖曰，
Laozi says:
有道之人若得至小之国，
If a Daoist person gains a very small state—
不多之民井而居之，
And few people as their well—
使有什伯，
Let them possess the tools of a hundred men—
如今人之保伍也，
Like how people today keep their reserves—
人人皆有可用之器，
Each person has tools that can be used—
而不求自用。
Yet they do not seek to use them themselves.

是人皆有士君子之行，
These are people who all possess the conduct of a scholar-gentleman—
而安於自退也。
Yet they are content with self-withdrawal.

重死而不远徙，
They value death over distant migration—
小人皆畏罪不为恶，
The petty fear punishment and do not commit evil—
而各安其居也。
Yet each remains secure in their own home.

虽有舟舆，无所乘之，
Though they have boats and carriages,
They do not ride them—
不致远以求利也。
Not traveling far to seek profit.

虽有甲兵而不陈列，
Though they have armor and weapons,
They do not display them—
不恃力以求胜也。
Not relying on strength to seek victory.

合书契而用结绳，
Using written contracts yet returning to knotted cords—
复於素朴也。
Returning to simplicity and purity.

甘食美衣，安居而乐俗，
Sweet food, beautiful clothing,
Secure homes and delight in customs—
邻国虽近，
Neighboring states, though close—
鸡狗之声虽相闻，
The sounds of roosters and dogs, though heard—
而老死不相往来，
Yet the people do not visit one another
Even until old age and death—
各自足而不相求也。
Each is self-sufficient and does not seek from others.

此老子因战国纷争，
This is what Laozi reflects upon,
Amidst the chaos of the Warring States—
而思上古淳朴之俗，
And ponders the simple and pure customs of antiquity—
欲复见之也。
Desiring to see them restored.

观其所言，亦有自用之意。
Looking at his words,
There is also the meaning of self-sufficiency.

**信言不美章第八十一**
**Chapter 81: True Words Are Not Ornate**

信言不美，
True words are not ornate—
美言不信。
Ornate words are not true.

善者不辩，
The good do not argue—
辩者不善。
Those who argue are not good.

知者不博，
The wise are not learned in many things—
博者不知。
Those learned in many things are not wise.

圣人不积，
The Sage does not hoard—
既以为人己愈有，
The more he gives to others,
The more he possesses—
既以与人己愈多。
The more he gives to others,
The more he has.

天之道，利而不害；
The Dao of Heaven benefits yet does not harm—
圣人之道，为而不争。
The Dao of the Sage acts yet does not contend.

This very meaning is expressed.

**善 (shàn)**, pure—
The person of pure virtue has no need for words,
So why argue?
To love argument is to lack pure virtue.

The knowing of the wise is not measured by their breadth of knowledge,
Nor do they boast in their knowledge—
This is not the way of the wise.

The Dao of the Sage is simply emptiness and unity—
What need for hoarding?
He never fails to act for others,
Yet what he retains grows ever more abundant.
He never fails to give to others,
Yet what he possesses grows ever more plentiful.

It is like the Dao of Heaven—
Empty yet unyielding,
Acting yet ever producing more.

To act for others, to give to others—
These are words that transform through the Dao.

Though Heaven’s Dao has beauty and benefit,
It does not speak of what it benefits,
So only benefit is seen and no harm.
Once the name of "benefiting" is given,
Then harm also becomes apparent.

The Dao of the Sage does nothing yet does all things,
Yet never relies on what it possesses,
So it does not contend with things,
And thus the world cannot contend with it.

The essence of this text is fundamentally about *not contending*,
So it concludes with these words.
