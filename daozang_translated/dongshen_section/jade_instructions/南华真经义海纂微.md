**Fascicle One of *The Ocean of Meanings in the True Scripture of Southern Florescence: A Compilation of Subtleties***
By Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin

**Inner Chapters: "Free and Easy Wandering" (First)**

In the Northern Darkness there is a fish, whose name is *Kun*.
The greatness of *Kun*—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans.
It transforms into a bird, whose name is *Peng*.
The back of *Peng*—no one knows how many thousand *li* it stretches.
When it rouses itself and takes flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky.
This bird, when the seas surge, will journey to the Southern Darkness.
The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond.

*The Qi Xie* is a record of marvels.
Its words say: When *Peng* journeys to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, then mounts the whirlwind to ascend ninety thousand *li*, departing with the winds of the sixth month.
The "wild horses" of the air, the dust motes—all living things are blown about by the breath of one another.
Is the deep blue of the sky its true color?
Or is it so distant that it has no limit?
When one looks down from above, it is just like this.

**Guo Xiang’s Annotation:**
The reality of *Kun* and *Peng* is something I have not yet fathomed.
The great purport of Master Zhuang lies in the free and easy wandering of self-attained nonaction.
Thus, he exhausts the conditions of the small and the great to clarify the fittingness of one’s allotted nature.
Those of far-reaching vision should grasp its convergence and forget its lodging.
That *Kun* transforms into *Peng*—only the Northern Darkness suffices to bear its body;
only the winds of ninety thousand *li* suffice to lift its wings.
How could this be a fondness for the strange?
It is simply that great things necessarily arise in great places, and great places necessarily give rise to such great things—this is the inherent principle.
The wings of *Peng* are too vast to lift easily, so it must strike the whirlwind before ascending ninety thousand *li*, departing for half a year before resting at the Celestial Pond.
The "wild horses" are wandering *qi*; *Peng* relies on them to fly.
When *Peng* looks down from above, it is just as when humans look up from below at the sky.

**Lü Huiqing’s Annotation:**
The *qi* of the world is one.
When yang reaches its extreme, yin arises; when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises—like a ring without end.
All things follow this in waxing and waning, flourishing and decaying; there is nothing that is not so.
The *Kun* of the Northern Darkness transforms into the *Peng* of the Southern Darkness—this is the passage from yin into yang.
The extremes of yin and yang are both obscured by the sky.
Three thousand and ninety thousand are both odd numbers.
The sixth month marks the distance between *zi* and *si*, *wu* and *hai*.
That *Peng*’s number is odd and it departs with the winds of the sixth month to rest suggests that *Kun*’s number is even and it departs with the dissipation of the sixth month—this can be known.
The "wild horses" and dust motes are all living things blown about by one another’s breath.
Breath is the work of *qi*, filling heaven and earth without gap.
Humans, dwelling within it, look up from below and see the sky’s deep blue—is this its true color?
Or is it so distant that it has no limit? It cannot be known.
Precisely because it cannot be known, one does not take one’s dwelling as below, so how could *Peng*, looking down from above, know what makes it high?

**Lin Yidu’s Annotation:**
The north is the direction of water.
Darkness is the concealment of light.
The Northern Darkness is where yin and yang enter and exit.
Master Zhuang uses *Kun* and *Peng* to illustrate the transformations of yin and yang, thus beginning with the Northern Darkness.
*Kun* is a yin creature; *Peng* is a yang creature.
*The Supreme Mystery* says: "The obscure has no form, the profound cannot be fathomed; stillness is called returning to the mandate"—this is the image of *Kun*.
All things flourish, polishing the work of heaven and illuminating the myriad things—this is the image of *Peng*.
When *Kun* first transforms into *Peng*, though it belongs to the yang kind, it has not yet departed from the obscure and subtle, so no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans.
Next, it speaks of three thousand *li*—the number is not yet complete.
Finally, it speaks of ninety thousand *li*—movement must have its limit.
Even the most distant and vast of embodied things cannot escape the reckoning of yin and yang, so when it moves, it is nine; when it rests, it is six.
Departing with the winds of the sixth month to rest is returning to yin.
Yin and yang alternate in their revolutions, mutually endless and beyond inquiry.
The "wild horses" and dust motes, the breath of living things, show how wind arises from the subtle and accumulates to the substantial, so that *Peng* awaits it to journey south.
**Chen Xiangdao’s Annotation:**
The Dao disperses to become yin and yang; yin and yang disperse to become the myriad things.
Emerging from yin and yang to return to the Dao, there is nowhere one does not wander freely;
entering yin and yang to cling to things, there is nowhere one is not bound.
Darkness is the concealment of light; light is the manifestation of darkness.
The Northern Darkness is entering to become the Dao; the Southern Darkness is emerging to become affairs.
Thus, Master Zhuang in the north lodges the deep-diving fish, and in the south lodges the soaring bird.
Water, in direction, is north; in *qi*, is essence; in season, is winter; in number, is one.
The transformations of things always begin here.
*Kun* as a creature is yang within yin; *Peng* as a creature is yin within yang.
Lurking in the north and journeying to the south do not depart from the directions of yin and yang.
Ninety thousand *li* and the sixth month do not depart from the reckoning of yin and yang.
Its back like Mount Tai, its wings like hanging clouds—it is not free from embodiment.
In transformation, it relies on water; in soaring, it relies on wind—it is not free from dependence.

When it stirs to take flight, it cannot be without emotion.
When it flies and rests, it cannot be without limit.

Even with the vastness of the *Kun* and *Peng*, their confinement within yin and yang is thus.
How much more so for the cicada, the turtledove, and the quail?

Master Bi Xu’s Chen Jingyuan annotates:
The Dao takes generation and transformation as its priority, and yin and yang as its origin.
The Northern Darkness gives birth to the *Kun*, which transforms into the *Peng*—its qi and form already complete, yet none know why it is so.
For the generation and transformation of yin and yang are divine and unfathomable.
At the inception of a thing’s transformation, its measure cannot be exhausted, hence it is said: "one knows not how many thousands of *li*."
Having life, it must have a destination, thus it stirs to fly and migrates to the Southern Darkness.
Having life and a destination, its capacity and strength cannot be without limit, hence it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, rides the whirlwind to ascend ninety thousand *li*, and departs only after six months of rest.
Six is a yin number, hence it is called "rest."

Within heaven and earth, the primordial qi billows and swirls, rising and falling in ceaseless return, hence the metaphors of "wild horses" and "dust motes."
All living things mutually rely on the breath of qi to propel and sustain one another, drifting east and west without obstruction or hindrance.
If one were to delimit things by the smallness or greatness of their forms, then yin and yang would be sundered, above and below would appear distinct, and none could attain harmony.

Wang Xu annotates:
The *Kun*, when lurking, dwells in the north.
The *Peng*, when flying, migrates to the Southern Darkness.
Even the most immense of embodied things, though capable of transformation, cannot escape the categories of yin and yang, and thus are constrained by creation and unable to attain freedom.
As the *Yi* says: "Directions gather by kind; things divide by groups."
The so-called "wandering in freedom" belongs only to that which is without direction or form.
Striking the water for three thousand *li* marks the flourishing of yang’s initial reckoning.
Movement must have its limit, hence it rides the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li* and departs only after six months of rest.
"Wild horses" and "dust motes" are what the *Peng* relies upon to fly—gazing downward from above is like a man on earth observing the heavens.
One who views the small from the great lacks clarity, and thus the *Peng* is burdened by its own vastness.

Xu Zhai’s Zhao Yifu annotates:
Zhuangzi’s *Kun* and *Peng* illustrate the qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang.
The fish transforms into a bird, migrating from north to south, from yin to yang, from stillness to motion.
The Classic designates the Southern Darkness as the "Celestial Pond," but since heaven envelops earth, the Northern Darkness is also a Celestial Pond.
Three is the inception of yang, for one contains three.
Nine is the extremity of yang, for three times three is nine.
Yang is born at *zi*, and six yangs culminate at *si*, hence the six-month rest.
"Wild horses" and "dust motes," though differing in size, share the same qi, breathing and propelling one another.
A man’s view of heaven is like the *Peng*’s view below—though high and low differ, the principle is one.

Lin Xiayi’s *Yunzhai Oral Exegesis* states:
The discourse on the *Kun* and *Peng*’s transformations merely depicts the boundless joy within the breast.
I say: worldly people, seeing only the small, engage in endless strife. If they knew of such worlds beyond heaven and earth, they would regard their own bodies as no more than a grain of millet in a granary!
The *Kun* and *Peng* are but allegories; one need not be bound by the theories of yin and yang.
For a bird to fly, it must rely on qi.
The addition of a single character—*shu*—renders it extraordinary.
"Three thousand" and "ninety thousand" merely describe its loftiness and distance.
"Departing after six months of rest" means that each flight requires half a year’s repose.
"Wild horses and dust motes, breathing and propelling one another"—these three lines elucidate the following passage.
"Gazing at the boundless heavens" further illustrates the height of the *Peng*’s flight, revealing the force of the brushwork.

Chu Shi’s *Insights* states:
"Darkness" refers to the undifferentiated oneness of primordial qi.
The north governs moistening qi, nurturing the germination of all things.
The south governs scorching qi, fostering the growth of all things.
Proceeding from north to south reflects yang’s birth from yin.
Though their positions differ, the qi remains uninterrupted.
The vast distance between them makes their gradual transformation imperceptible, just as the turning of the four seasons—intense cold and sweltering heat—do not arise in a single morning.
Thus, the *Kun* and *Peng*’s transformation, from extreme stillness to motion, riding the wind for ninety thousand *li* and resting for six months, does not transcend the mutual alternation of yin and yang, but resides within the undifferentiated oneness of primordial qi.
Hence, both north and south are called "Darkness."

The Old Immortal of Nanhua lamented the wars among the states and the cramped, vulgar pursuits of his time.
Scholars of the age were confined by their limited perceptions, prizing rhetorical stratagems and seizing fame and profit, while neglecting their own innate nature.
Thus, he composed his work with fervor, crafting far-reaching discourses to elucidate the supreme principle and liberate the human mind.
He declared that one who attains this Dao harmonizes virtue with heaven and earth, moves in unison with yin and yang, and adapts to concealment or revelation in all circumstances, wandering freely without hindrance.
The yin and yang of heaven and earth are the yin and yang of the human body; water and fire derive their origins from them, and the transformations of nature and emotion rely upon them.
They extend above and coil below, reaching all extremes.
Yet they are not perceptible to sight or hearing, so he established the *Kun* and *Peng* as provisional names, guiding learners to first understand the mind through things, then forget form to unite with the Dao, deeply rooting and settling the ultimate, and merging subtly with the mechanism of transformation.
The yin and yang of our bodies are in constant motion; the heaven and earth within us never cease.
From this, we know that human nature is inherently endowed with freedom, yet the vulgar world remains deluded, forgetting truth to chase falsehood, fretting over life and death, and worrying over gain and loss, unaware of what true freedom entails.
Thus, he expounds further to dispel their confusion, likening human life and death to a fish transforming into a bird—shedding scales for feathers, abandoning swimming for flight—emotions following form in transformation, each fulfilling its nature.
Creation is boundless, and so too is its endowment; where is there room for love or aversion?
At the inception of a thing’s transformation, its changes are immeasurable, hence "one knows not how many thousands of *li*."

When the roc migrates to the Southern Darkness, the measure of thirty thousand *li* takes form—its journey powered by six months’ breath, where yin wanes and yang waxes, the ceaseless mechanism of creation. The "wild horses" and "dust motes" are but metaphors for fleeting phenomena. Should one master the root and grasp the essence of the roc’s flight, one would transcend the mundane, roaming beyond the dust of the world. The six directions’ inflow of qi and the mutual respiration of the ten thousand beings serve only to propel one another, lifting all without becoming a burden. In every movement and turn, there is nowhere one does not find ease—such is the *xiaoyaoyou*, the carefree wandering. Thus, this passage crowns the sutra’s intent.

The line *"Its wings beat the air as if in fury"* has seldom been elucidated in commentaries. Yet a meaning beyond the words may be appended here: Heaven and earth are endowed with the One Qi; the ten thousand things are endowed by heaven and earth. From the One Qi, heaven and earth divide; through their union, the ten thousand things arise. Separating and merging without end, generation and transformation are boundless—small and great, short and long, each fulfills its allotted portion. From receiving qi to taking form, from numerical limits to material change, embracing yin and holding yang, each awaits its time. What must transform cannot but transform; what must take flight cannot but fly—all driven by the celestial mechanism, though the transformed remain unaware. *"Beating the air as if in fury"* expresses the inevitability of movement: *nu* (fury) is akin to *yong* (vigorous), compelled by qi to surge forth swiftly, as if enraged—yet this is no mere indignation or resentment. All things coiled long will spring forth; all bent long will stretch. Do they weary of constancy and crave change? Rather, confined within form and great transformation, they follow the ebb and flow of the two qi—fullness and emptiness, waxing and waning—a principle inescapable.

The *Qiwulun* speaks of *"the ten thousand hollows roaring in fury,"* and the *Waiwu* of *"plants and trees growing in vigor"*—both convey this same idea. The *Daodejing*’s *"the ten thousand things rising together"* echoes it as well. Observing this cycle of return, the meaning of the *"six months’ breath"* becomes clear. Yet世人 see only the fury and not the rest, know only action and not return. Thus, they turn from the realm of carefree wandering, daily drifting toward the domain of striving, entangled in affairs, ensnared by troubles, toiling like draft animals, lost and without refuge—how lamentable!

Master Guanyin said: *"Though heaven and earth are vast, they can enslave the formed but not the formless."* To escape servitude to the two qi, seek it before the *mingyu* takes shape.

Moreover, if water is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear a great vessel. Pour a cup of water onto a hollow in the floor, and a mustard seed may serve as a boat—yet place the cup there, and it will run aground, for the water is shallow and the vessel too large. If wind is not thickly gathered, it lacks the strength to bear great wings. Thus, only at ninety thousand *li* does the wind lie beneath, and only then can one ride the wind. Only by bearing the blue sky on one’s back, unobstructed, can one then set course for the south.

The cicada and the fledgling dove laugh, saying: *"We burst forth in flight, darting between the elm and sandalwood—sometimes we fall short and land on the ground. Why travel ninety thousand *li* to the south?"* One who journeys to the near wilderness returns after three meals, belly still full; one bound for a hundred *li* prepares provisions the night before; one traveling a thousand *li* gathers three months’ rations. What do these two creatures know?

Lesser knowledge cannot fathom greater; short years cannot comprehend long. How do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not dawn and dusk; the summer cicada knows not spring and autumn—these are short-lived. South of Chu lies the *Mingling*, for whom five hundred years are a spring, five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity, there was the *Dazhuang*, for whom eight thousand years were a spring, eight thousand years an autumn. Yet Pengzu alone is famed for longevity—how pitiful that common folk compare themselves to him!

This passage serves as an extended metaphor to elaborate the preceding text. Next, it presents the dialogue between the cicada and the fledgling dove to illustrate the distinction between small and great, each content with its own measure and free from envy. This is the essence of the *xiaoyaoyou* (carefree wandering). It further discusses how the distance of one’s journey determines the provisions required—how much less do these two creatures know?

Here, the "two creatures" refer to the cicada and the fledgling dove, both equally ignorant. The contrast between lesser knowledge and greater knowledge, shorter years and longer years, unfolds through layered metaphors, yet the principle remains unchanged. The meaning of the classic text is clear and requires no further annotation.

This echoes Tang’s questioning of Ji. Beyond the northern lands of unbroken vegetation lies the Dark Sea, a celestial lake. There dwells a fish, its breadth spanning thousands of *li*, its length unknown—its name is Kun. There is also a bird named Peng, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky. It beats the whirlwind, spiraling upward ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds, bearing the blue heavens on its back, then turning southward, bound for the Southern Darkness.

The quail laughs at it, saying: "Where is it going? I leap and flutter upward, no more than a few fathoms before descending, soaring among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the perfection of flight. Where is *it* going?" Such is the distinction between small and great.

Thus, those whose knowledge suffices for a single office, whose conduct matches a single village, whose virtue aligns with a single lord, or whose influence sways a single state—they regard themselves in the same way. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them. For though the whole world praises him, he is not encouraged; though the whole world blames him, he is not disheartened. He has settled the division between inner and outer, distinguished the boundary between honor and disgrace—this is all. In his relation to the world, he is not frantically driven. Yet even so, he has not yet established himself.

Liezi could ride the wind and travel, effortlessly and gracefully, returning after fifteen days. In his pursuit of fortune, he was not frantically driven. Though he thus avoided walking, he still depended on something. But one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, harnesses the transformations of the six *qi*, and wanders through the boundless—what does *he* depend on?

Therefore it is said: The Perfect One is without self, the Spirit Man is without achievement, the Sage is without name.

Lu Deming’s *Sound and Meaning* notes: Ji was a worthy of Tang’s time. Cui’s commentary states: He was also of the *Qi Xie* school, able to recognize the winters of the *Mingling* and *Dazhuang*. Guo Xiang’s annotation: Tang’s questioning of Ji also says: "All things have their limits; when left to follow their nature, they flourish." Thus Zhuangzi regarded Ji’s question as valid. Lü Huiqing says: This reference to Tang’s questioning of Ji is because such words have existed since antiquity—what is called "repeated words." Ji’s account of Kun and Peng is the same as the one just cited, as seen in the *Liezi*, though more concise.

Lin Yidu’s annotation records the affair of Yin Tang and Xia Ge. It begins with "In the ancient beginning, there were things" and ends with "within the boundless." Beyond the boundless, there is again no boundless—this aligns with the preceding text and is thus adduced as evidence. Yet Guo Xiang claims: "All things have their limits; when left to follow their nature, they flourish"—this is not Zhuangzi’s original intent. Readers may seek the correct interpretation in the *Liezi*.

Chu’s *Superficial Observations* states: According to the *Liezi*, it was Yin Tang questioning Xia Ge. Ge and Ji are similar in sound and meaning, both denoting urgency. Cui’s interpretation takes this sentence as concluding the preceding discussion of the *Mingling* and *Dazhuang*, while Lü’s annotation uses it to introduce the following discourse on the Dark Sea—each follows their own division of the text. The *Daguan* edition with eight commentaries treats this sentence as an independent passage, though this seems forced between the preceding and following sections. Lin’s annotation aligns with Cui’s, while Chen Jingyuan’s *Bixu* edition begins the second chapter here, following Lü’s view.

Upon careful examination of the text’s intent, it aims to substantiate the meaning of Kun and Peng. Thus, it first introduces the theme and then presents two pieces of evidence: the account from *Qi Xie* and Tang’s questioning of Ji. It further corroborates Zhuangzi’s words with the *Liezi*’s *Tang Wen* chapter on the Dark Sea and celestial lake. Therefore, this chapter naturally begins after the phrase "Tang’s questioning of Ji is also thus," with "is also thus" serving to confirm the preceding text and generate the following discourse. Many readers fail to recognize this distinction, mistakenly treating it as the conclusion of the previous chapter. If it were the conclusion, the meaning would be exhausted, and the next chapter would not restart the discussion from "Beyond the northern lands of unbroken vegetation"—this would not be the proper structure of argument.

Thus, I venture to append this explanation to clarify the doubt. Lin of Zhuxi also states: According to this sentence, it should belong to the following section as a concluding phrase turned into an opening one. The subsequent text then reintroduces the discussion of Kun and Peng, not to re-explain the earlier lines on "knowledge sufficing for an office" or "conduct matching a village," but to show that the capacities of small and great each have their proper application, with fitness as the measure. Song Rongzi’s laughter at them indicates he is not moved by honor or profit, embodying the use of what is seemingly useless—transcending the realm of knowledge and ability. Yet even he is deemed "not yet established," revealing the loftiness of his vision.

Liezi, who could ride the wind yet still depended on something, reaches the ultimate in harnessing the six *qi* to wander the boundless. Thus, it concludes: The Perfect One is without self, the Spirit Man is without achievement, the Sage is without name. These three represent the pinnacle of the human Dao, summarizing the central meaning of the *Xiaoyaoyou*’s opening chapter. For the utmost Dao is profoundly mysterious, ascending to the realm of the sage—yet it does not exceed the principle of the "three withouts." Entering it, one speaks of perfection; emerging, one speaks of sageliness. The spirit moves within it, unbounded and without fixed direction. Its vastness resides in humanity, its principle merely entrusted.

Thus, in establishing teachings, there is naturally an order. All living beings cling to private profit, yet it is easy to plant the value of forgetting the self.

Pride and self-importance easily arise; next, one must forget merit. Once personal merit is forgotten, others’ praise will naturally follow. Yet one must further forget fame to distance worldly burdens. When burdens are far removed, the body remains whole, the Dao pure, and virtue unadulterated. In this state, one’s conduct among others and responses to affairs will be flawless, and the names of the three—Perfect One, Spirit Man, and Sage—will blend and dissolve into oneness.

Observing the talented and heroic figures of past and present, those who have built merit and established fame are many, yet few have preserved their wisdom and integrity. Is this due to insufficient intelligence? No—their Dao-heart remains obscured, hindered by something within. In youth, one studies; in maturity, one acts, aspiring to establish merit. Merit serves others, yet once achieved, it invites envy. One cultivates the self and builds a career to spread one’s name, for fame refines customs,

Later, the text cites the butcher’s carving as a metaphor for *youwei* (purposeful action) and the spirit-medium’s invocation as a metaphor for *wuwei* (effortless non-action). The *shenren* (Spirit Man) cannot but practice *wuwei*, just as the sage cannot but practice *youwei*.

Chen Xiangdao’s commentary states: Yao was one who governed the world; You was one who forgot the world. Governing the world brings substantive loss yet establishes a name; forgetting the world gathers substance yet erases the name. When the world is already well-governed, it cannot be handed to another; when the world is wholly forgotten, it cannot be taken up in another’s stead. This is why Yao’s aspiration could not be realized through You, and why You’s resolve could not be bent by Yao. The rising of the sun and moon serves as a metaphor for wisdom that pervades all things; the falling of timely rain, for the Dao that aids the world. The wren finds sufficiency in a single branch, content with externals; the mole drinks its fill, content within. The butcher is one who acts upon affairs; the spirit-medium, one who remains untouched by them. Action brings many burdens, so the unburdened never inquire beyond their station—this is why You did not overstep his role to replace Yao.

Chen Bixu’s commentary states: The emblems of rank and the throne must not be lent to others. How dare one lightly accept the greatest treasure! You valued his person and disdained worldly things, refusing to treat the world as a profit. If each person refused to profit from the world, the world would govern itself. Thus, he served no kings or lords, elevating his own path—his resolve was worthy of emulation. He who knows others is wise; he who knows himself is enlightened. Without knowing others, one cannot navigate benefit and harm in human affairs; without self-knowledge, one cannot grasp Heaven’s mandate and merge with spontaneity. This is how Yao knew You, and how You knew himself.

Wang Dan’s discourse states: Heaven emerges from *wuwei*; humanity, from *youwei*. The *wuwei* practitioner sees *youwei* as a burden; the *youwei* practitioner takes *wuwei* as the foundation. In his *youwei* phase, Yao was Son of Heaven, possessing all under Heaven, yet did not consider it excess. In his *wuwei* phase, You was a commoner, hidden on Mount Ji, yet did not consider it lack. Yao is likened to Heaven’s workings—sun, moon, and timely rain; You to human efforts—artificial fire and irrigation. Yao, though capable of governing the world, dared not usurp You’s role; You, though capable of governing, refused to replace Yao. Then who shall govern the world? If governed by Yao, it is *youwei* with *wuwei* at its core; if by You, it is *wuwei* with *youwei* as its expression. The Dao within the sage appears as Yao when manifest and as You when concealed—what need is there for choice?

Xu Zhao’s annotation states: Yao and You are not two separate beings; the reader must seek their meaning beyond the words. The dialogue between Yao and Shun in the *Tian Yun* chapter conveys this same intent.

Chu Shi’s *Guanjian* states: Upon reading the chapter on Yao’s abdication, the pure and ancient spirit of yielding and deference comes vividly to life, revealing how the sage reveres the Dao and honors virtue, placing others before self, governing the body as primary and treating worldly rule as secondary. Those who wage war and seize even an inch of land—how degenerate are later ages! Yao compared his achievements to the humble tasks of kindling fire and irrigation, his humility reaching its utmost—how could he have set his heart on imperial trappings? You measured his capacity by the wren and the mole, content within his innate bounds—how could he have sought fortune and rank? With a divine Yao on the throne, there naturally arose a You in reclusion, their resonance drawn by shared principle. Yao’s concern for the world ran deep: though the Four Seas were at peace, none but You could succeed him. You’s disregard for the world was absolute: the Four Seas already governed, what had he to do with it? Without unwavering conviction in great responsibility, Yao’s profound wisdom would not be evident; without lofty disdain for acceptance, You’s pure embrace of the Dao would not be seen. The sage does not weigh importance by public or private roles but by righteousness and principle in departure or stay—this depends on the Dao’s unfolding and the timeliness of the moment. Yao’s knowledge of You was precise, so he did not wait for trials but offered the throne in his stead. Had You suddenly accepted, he would not have lost the dignity of tranquil rule; had Yao gracefully retired, he could have concealed his brilliance. In the highest antiquity, the sage’s visibility and obscurity aligned with the Dao, like tallying tokens—how could the vulgar fathom its depths?

Moreover, You’s relationship to Yao was as subject to ruler by station, as teacher to student by the Dao. His subtle counsel and the marvel of heart-transmission were the very means by which he aided Yao—even had he received the world, it would not have been excessive. Yet You’s integrity was such that he asked, “What use is the world to me?” The saying “Names are but guests to reality” alone suffices as a model for all ages. Extending this principle, it not only awakens Deng Ye from his dream and silences the quarrels of the belligerent, but also inspires later generations to imagine the allure of Mount Ji and the Ying River, where even a single gourd is felt as a burden. Ultimately, the analogy of the spirit-medium not overstepping his role to take the butcher’s place illustrates Yao’s supreme virtue in knowing others and You’s hidden virtue in knowing himself. Each rests in what is fitting, each finds sufficiency in what is sufficient—and the world is at peace.

Though the spirit-medium and the butcher differ in rank and labor, their positions seem unequal, yet both are bound by sincerity in invoking the spirits and reverence in facing affairs. There is a principle by which one could replace the other, yet the ancients would not do so. In later ages of moral decline, some rebel against ethics and reason, vainly seeking to usurp another’s role. Fortunately, this scripture endures, clarifying the proper measure of advancement and retreat, the boundaries of bestowal and reception, and cutting off the world’s ambitions for ill-gotten gains. Alas!

The Old Immortal of Nanhua is also a sage. Knowing that after the Dao and worldly ways had both perished, men would devour one another, he meticulously recorded the yielding deeds of the ancient sages, hoping that by tracing You’s flight, one might seek his heart. This is akin to Bian Que administering medicine before illness arises—a subtle means of aiding the world’s teachings, though few recognize it. With reverence, I have expounded the intent behind his words and brought it to light.

Jian Wu asked Lian Shu, saying: "I heard words from Jie Yu—vast yet without measure, gone and never returning. I was startled and terrified by his speech, as if it were the Milky Way without end. So grand and divergent, it seemed far from human sentiment."

Lian Shu said: "What did his words say?"

Jian Wu replied: "On the distant Mount Miaogu She, there dwells a divine person. Their skin is like ice and snow, their bearing supple as a maiden’s. They eat no grains, but draw in wind and drink dew. They ride the clouds and qi, mount flying dragons, and roam beyond the four seas. Their spirit congeals, so that things suffer no blight and the year’s harvest ripens. I deem this madness and do not believe it."

Lian Shu said: "Indeed. The blind cannot partake in the spectacle of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that may be deaf and blind? The mind, too, may be so. His words are like a maiden’s—timely yet untouched. That person, that virtue, would unify the myriad things as one. Should the world’s kindling be in chaos, who would trouble themselves with the affairs of the world? That person—nothing harms them. Though great floods reach the heavens, they do not drown; though great droughts melt metal and stone and scorch mountains to ash, they do not burn. Their dust and chaff could mold even Yao and Shun—who would deign to busy themselves with worldly matters?

The people of Song carried ceremonial caps to Yue, yet the Yue people, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. Yao governed the people of the world and brought order to the realm’s affairs. Yet when he went to see the Four Masters on Mount Miaogu She, north of the Fen River, he suddenly lost all thought of his empire."

**Guo Xiang’s Annotation:** The divine person is none other than the sage. Though dwelling in the halls of governance, they are no different from those in the mountains and forests. Here, one who embodies royal virtue is placed upon this mountain to show that the world has no way to recognize them. Thus, they are set beyond the farthest reaches, pushed beyond the bounds of sight and hearing.

**Lü Huiqing’s Annotation:** Only those who embody the Dao can ascend Mount Miaogu She. The divine person is what all human hearts share; only those who exhaust the spirit can perceive them. *Miao* means to gaze distantly; *gu* means "for now"; *she* means "to reject." To climb this mountain is to see all worldly affairs as unworthy of regard—thus one gazes distantly and rejects them. Who but a divine person could attain this?

**Lin Yidu’s Annotation:** This passage contains the utmost truth. What the sages kept secret and did not speak of is this: the Dao reaches a point beyond words, so Jie Yu’s speech is invoked to clarify the way of the divine and the sage, with intent lodged in Miaogu She. *Miao* suggests remoteness—this mountain need not exist, much like the Five Mountains in the *Liezi*. The divine person is sage yet unknowable; how could words ever exhaust them?

**Chen Xiangdao’s Annotation:** Mount Miaogu She is a metaphor for the Dao. The divine person has no form—the Dao is their form; the divine person has no function—the Dao is their function. Thus, where the divine person dwells is simply the Dao.

**Chen Bixu’s Annotation:** The divine person is an allegory for the sage-king who embodies the Dao, serene and without action, rising and descending with transformation. With no trace of governance, those who act deem them mad and do not believe.

**Lü Chou’s Annotation:** Mount Miaogu She is set beyond the seas as a rhetorical device to marvel at the divine person’s wondrous dwelling, which the vulgar cannot know.

**Wang Pang’s Annotation:** Mount Miaogu She lies in the Northern Sea, a metaphor for returning to the root and reviving the mandate.

**Lecturer Fan of West Shu’s Hidden Realm:** The mountain is a metaphor for the body. *Miao* and *she* suggest its profound obscurity. The divine person is the utmost spirit within the body. If one seeks within this obscurity and finds the body’s utmost spirit, then not eating grains, drawing in wind, drinking dew, riding clouds, mounting dragons, and roaming the four seas are no exaggeration. To seek this outside oneself—is that not far indeed?

**Chu’s Insight:** The chapter on the divine person of Miaogu She speaks of one who does not consume worldly sustenance. Without direct transmission from the sages, how could their teachings descend to humanity? The lodging of the Dao is most essential here. Yet the words are subtle and profound, difficult for beginners to fathom. Examining the prior annotations, Lü and Lin grasp the thread, while later, Lecturer Wu Yin elaborates fully, directly pointing to the mystery and revealing the sages’ unspoken secret, opening the inherent heaven of learners. Alas, that I cannot lead all beings by the hand to ascend Miaogu She and join in carefree wandering! His intent is truly universal.

**Bo Xiu’s Postscript:** Having fortunately received such compassionate instruction, I dare not keep it private. With reverence, I append these annotations to propagate the Dharma and extend their meaning, offering a detailed explication below:

Their skin like ice and snow—embodying pure simplicity, unstained by dust. Supple as a maiden—preserving softness to remain whole, untouched by harm. Not eating grains, drawing in wind and drinking dew—they sever worldly tastes and absorb heaven and earth’s clarity. Riding clouds and mounting dragons, roaming the four seas—they soar through the vastness, merging with the primordial qi’s obscurity. This is what is meant by "arriving without moving, wandering with creation."

Their spirit congealed, so that things suffer no blight and the year’s harvest ripens—this is the utmost cultivation of spirit. Not only do they preserve themselves, but they also aid heaven and earth’s transformation and nurture the myriad things’ spontaneity. This speaks of the effect of extending oneself to others, thus merging with the unfathomable spirit and uniting with the boundless Dao!

Yet some, swayed by names and forms, seek this mountain beyond the farthest reaches—the divine person becomes even more distant. I humbly observe that the wonders of exhausting the spirit and perfecting transformation are fully revealed in this chapter. Yet those who hear it deem it madness and do not believe—how could this be only Jian Wu? This passage aligns with the second chapter of the *Liezi’s* "Yellow Emperor," differing slightly in wording but identical in meaning.

Zhuangzi of Nanhua attributed this to Jie Yu—this was but a means to lend mystery to his traces. The rest of the text is plain and comprehensible, so I shall not belabor its explication. Only the phrase *"du you shi nü ye"* admits of two interpretations: Guo Xiang, Cheng Xuanying, and others explain it as "like a maiden in her prime, naturally sought after by all things." Yet those whose wisdom is deaf and blind deny such a principle exists. Zhao of Xuzhai takes *shi* as "this," *nü* as "you," citing the *Book of Documents* where *"shi nü gong"* shares the same meaning. Lian Shu thus tells Jian Wu that the divine person resembles *you*. The *Liezi*'s "what is born and what takes form" aligns with Zhao's phonetic gloss in Yongzhai's oral exegesis.

As for the passage on "dust, grime, chaff, and husks molding Yao and Shun," it may seem to slight them—yet upon examining the sutra's intent, it is in fact the highest veneration. What the world extols as Yao and Shun, revering them as sages, are but the dust, grime, chaff, and husks of their names. How could the true essence of Yao and Shun be captured in words? When Yao went to see the Four Masters on Mount Miaogushe, their teachings diverged. According to Lu Deming’s *Sound and Meaning*, Sima Biao’s old commentary identifies them as Wang Ni, Nie Que, Pi Yi, and Xu You. Guo Xiang’s annotation states that the Four Masters are figurative, illustrating that Yao was not confined to being "Yao." For Yao was truly profound: in advancement, he was Yao; yet from the perspective of advancement, he observed his profundity—inner and outer realms thus differed. The world sees only Yao as Yao; how could they recognize his profundity? Thus, to seek the Four Masters beyond the seas based on Yao’s encounter is to mistake those who ride the waves of things for those who attain true freedom.

Master Cheng’s commentary explains the Four Masters as four virtues: the root, the trace, the neither-root-nor-trace, and the neither-neither-root-nor-trace. Yao, reflecting inwardly upon the source of his mind, penetrated the realm of the Dao, transcending these four distinctions—hence it is said he "went to see the Four Masters." Lü Huiqing annotates: "Yao went to see the Four Masters on Mount Miaogushe—this is to see the divine person. The divine person is the mind seeing itself, thus there is no self. With no self, even if one possesses the world, what use is the world?"

Another interpretation holds that Yao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; and Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi. All Four Masters mastered the spirit, and Yao entered through them—hence he "went to see them." Lin Yi’s solitary annotation reads: "Yao’s achievements in governing the world and pacifying the seas resemble a man of Song carrying ceremonial caps to Yue—useless. Chen Xiangdao annotates: "The Four Masters were those who did not take the world or things as their concern." Lian Shu ascribes to the divine person the qualities of being unharmed by great floods or droughts; Wang Ni ascribes to the perfected person the qualities of being unscathed by marsh fires or river freezes; the River Lord ascribes to the virtuous person the qualities of being unharmed by cold or heat, or harmed by birds and beasts; Confucius ascribes to the true person the qualities of traversing Mount Tai without obstruction or entering deep springs without getting wet. These four persons all harmonized their minds with primordial qi and merged their bodies with yin and yang. Yao attained the Way of the Four Masters—hence it is said he "went to see them."

Chen Bixu annotates: "Those who forget the world have no attachment to superficial names, yet the more they are revered, the more profoundly they forget. Thus, by putting the self aside, the self endures; by placing the self last, the self leads. This is why the world delights in exalting them without tiring." Wu Chou annotates: "From Yao’s own perspective, inner and outer realms differ. Those who govern the world and pacify the seas see only its edges. Yet Yao’s mind was vast and all-pervading, far beyond distant frontiers—no single region could confine him." Zhao of Xuzhai annotates Yao’s "going to see the Four Masters": "Was there truly someone to be seen? It was but an inward search. Only those who understand that Xu You *is* Yao can grasp this." The central theme of this chapter lies in the dialogue between Jian Wu and Lian Shu. Mastering this unlocks the meaning from beginning to end.

Lin Yongqi’s interpretation states: "The Four Masters, being nameless, are variously identified as Xu You, Nie Que, Wang Ni, and Pi Yi, or as the root, the trace, the neither-root-nor-trace, and the neither-neither-root-nor-trace. Such pursuits only grow more absurd. This is precisely Zhuangzi’s playful wit—like what people today call 'head-cutting words,' meant to provoke reflection. For the world is confined by its own perceptions, unaware of its delusion; only with great insight can one pierce through." Lecturer Fan of West Shu’s Wuyin says: "The Four Masters symbolize the four great elements; *miaoshe* describes their subtlety. Though Yao governed the world and pacified the seas, his traces appeared active while his mind never strayed from the Dao. He could reflect inwardly upon the four great elements in their subtlety—thus, with all burdens dissolved, he attained freedom."

Chu’s *Superficial Observations* states: "The above interpretations of the Four Masters vary. Some capture the general meaning but miss the specifics; others align with the numbers but stray from the essence. Among the accessible explanations, Xuzhai’s is most sound in principle, while Lecturer Fan’s encompasses both number and meaning—both are worthy of esteem." Now, these so-called Four Masters are allegorical, illuminating the Dao. Yet the Dao, as a thing, is elusive and obscure, difficult to define by form or number. Only when the scholar’s focus is undivided and they arrive at their own insight can the truth be grasped—mere words cannot exhaust it. Based on the sutra’s intent, I venture this explanation: Yao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s Way derived from Nie Que, Wang Ni, and Pi Yi—thus the Way of the Four Masters was one. Yao, forgetting form to seek the Dao, was said to have "gone to see them" on Mount Miaogushe, which is the earlier metaphor of inwardly observing the subtlety within the self. This Way is timeless, whether in ancient or modern times, ruler or subject.

The ruler who attains this Dao becomes the present-day Emperor Yao; the commoner who attains this Dao becomes the present-day Xu You. The Fen River marks the site of Yao’s capital—without leaving his place, he could perceive the Four Masters, for the Dao is not to be sought in distant quests. "Profoundly relinquishing his realm" describes casting it aside like worn-out sandals.

Further delving into the ancestral sutra, I have privately found resonance, reverently discerning its forms, entities, essences, and truths. In interpreting the Four Masters, their meanings align seamlessly. Once the Four Masters are seen, the highest worth resides within oneself. The honor of ten thousand chariots and the wealth of the four seas become matters of no concern.

Hui Zi said to Zhuangzi: "The King of Wei bestowed upon me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they bore fruit of five *shi* in capacity. When used to hold water or broth, its strength could not support its own weight. When split to make ladles, its vastness left no vessel to contain it. Though not lacking in size, I deemed it useless and smashed it."

Zhuangzi replied: "You are indeed inept at putting great things to use. There was a man of Song skilled in crafting an ointment that prevented chapped hands. For generations, his family made their living by washing silk. A traveler heard of this and offered a hundred gold pieces for the formula. The clan gathered to deliberate: 'For generations, we have earned no more than a few pieces of gold from washing silk. Now, in a single morning, we could sell this craft for a hundred gold. Let us give it to him.' The traveler acquired it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue raised a challenge, the King of Wu appointed him general. In winter, he engaged the Yue forces in naval battle, decisively defeating them, and was enfeoffed with lands. The same ointment that prevented chapped hands brought one man a fief, while another remained bound to washing silk—such is the difference in how it was used. Now you possess a gourd of five *shi*—why not consider fashioning it into a great float to drift upon rivers and lakes, instead of fretting over its vastness leaving no vessel to contain it? Clearly, your mind remains entangled in conventional constraints!"

Hui Zi said to Zhuangzi: "I have a great tree, which people call the *chu*. Its massive trunk is gnarled and unfit for the carpenter’s line, its slender branches twisted and unsuited to compass or square. Standing by the roadside, no craftsman gives it a glance. Now your words are vast but useless—rejected by all."

Zhuangzi replied: "Have you alone never seen the wildcat or weasel? Crouching low to lie in wait, it pounces on passing prey, leaping east and west, heedless of height or depth..."

Trapped by snares and crushed in nets, they die in woven traps. Now consider the yak: its bulk hangs like clouds trailing the sky. This creature may be great indeed, yet it cannot catch a mouse. You possess a great tree and fret over its uselessness—why not plant it in the land of Nothing Whatever, the boundless wilds? Wander carefree at its side, recline at ease beneath its shade. Unfelled by axes, untouched by harm, it suffers no use—how then could it know hardship?

Guo Xiang’s note: The salve keeps hands from cracking, so they float flax in water. Yet the *peng* is no mere vessel of direct passage. All things have their proper place; if they find it, where could they not be at ease? Whether small or great, if they lose their measure, the logic of profit and harm becomes the same. When use finds its proper place, all things wander free.

Lü Huiqing’s note: Hui Zi, bound by form and vessel, called Zhuangzi’s words vast but useless, so he compared them to the great gourd. From its planting to its growth, I have observed his words from beginning to end—yet in truth, a five-*shi* gourd cannot even lift itself, for he seeks it in form and is burdened by embodiment. Split it to make a ladle, and its vastness finds no container; thus, in use, it is confined to the cosmos and cannot escape. To employ a great thing in a great place—yet Hui Zi is burdened by embodiment, so he doubts and questions. Thus Zhuangzi answers with clumsiness in using greatness. He then cites the salve for chapped hands as an analogy: the Dao’s words are one, but if used poorly, they cannot even suffice for the limbs—so generations wash flax for mere coins. If used well, they not only suffice for the body but can rescue a drowning world, as in naval battles where land is seized and titles conferred. A vessel that never fills when poured, never empties when drawn—this too is one’s rivers and lakes. You possess a great vessel yet cannot float it in a great place, fretting over its lack of containment—is this not rightly called a mind entangled in conventional constraints?

Hui Zi, still unenlightened, again questioned the great *chu*. Things take usefulness as their use, and their use is small; they take uselessness as their use, and their use is great. The wildcat and weasel leap and bound, dying in nets—they cannot be without action and perish by their own cunning. The yak is vast but cannot catch a mouse. This is the analogy of carefree wandering and non-action, preserving form and life. The sage’s relation to the Dao is to embody it with deep roots and firm stem, so that as a tree, it becomes great. For those who wish to plant it, nothing is better than returning to seek the heart. The heart as a thing knows no abode; find its unknowable place and settle there—this is planting it in the land of Nothing Whatever. Fill it, and it pervades the six directions; still it, and the myriad things do not disturb. Wander at its side, recline beneath it—never for a moment depart. Then what hardship could the so-called vast and useless know, that you should sigh over it?

Though Hui Zi was most wise, he could not thoroughly empty the heart and discard knowledge to reach the state before things arose. Thus, he could not doubt the Dao, so Zhuangzi expounded on uselessness and dispassion. Those who doubt later may ponder and grasp it.

Lin Yi’s sole note: The King of Wei bestowed upon me the seeds of a great gourd, an analogy for Heaven endowing me with a hollow nature. Its growth is an analogy for receiving and preserving it. Its capacity of five *shi* is an analogy for filling it with the five constants. To hold water and wine, its clarity and coolness can mirror the myriad things. Yet its hardness cannot lift itself—are not the five constants within the body also heavy? Split it to make a ladle, and it divides in two. Its vastness finds no container, so it is deemed useless and smashed—an analogy for the scattering of nature, which cannot be preserved, though all remains bright within. Thus, one assumes it cannot be restored and fails to awaken, for emotion has seized it. You cannot preserve the great gourd’s use, just as one cannot fulfill their nature. Thus, he cites the Song man’s salve for chapped hands to clarify the difference in use. People possess a hollow nature; they should fill it with carefree wandering, follow non-action, just as one considers the great gourd’s form and fashions it into a great float to drift upon rivers and lakes—why then fret over its lack of containment? Failing to fulfill nature is not true attainment, so he says it is a mind entangled in conventional constraints. Hui Zi again questions the great *chu*—gnarled and twisted, rejected by all—as a mockery of Zhuangzi’s words being vast but useless. Thus, he cites the wildcat, weasel, and yak in reply. Though small and great differ, and quickness and dullness vary, those skilled in use are not free from hardship. Therefore, the sage preserves the root of life and embodies the Dao as use. The *chu* deepens its roots and flourishes in branches and leaves; life secures its foundation, and the myriad affairs are ordered. The *Book of Changes* says: "Constancy is the stem of affairs." This is why the stem is the foundation. *Nothing Whatever* speaks of its emptiness; *boundless* speaks of its vastness. You possess a great tree—just as one possesses a true mandate—why not plant it in the land of emptiness and boundlessness, allowing it to wander carefree and non-active, unharmed and uncut? This is how the spirit-person achieves great auspiciousness.

Chen Xiangdao’s note: Things have their proper place; affairs have their fitting use. The trouble lies only in not using them well. The salve for chapped hands is one, yet the Song man’s use of it brought small profit, while the Wu man’s use brought great. The art of weakening the seven states was one, yet Chao Cuo’s use of it brought disaster, while Zhufu Yan’s use quelled chaos. Is the use of the great gourd any different? The gourd as a thing is hollow within and excels at containment; round without, it excels at floating. Placed on the ground, it loses its floating nature.

Round yet too cumbersome to lift, split into ladles, it destroys its spherical form and the gourd becomes hollow and useless. But if one hollows it into a floating vessel and sets it upon rivers and lakes, it rises effortlessly and adapts to every purpose. Of all things under heaven, the small are easily put to use, the great are difficult to employ—yet human nature is ever skilled in using the small, often clumsy in wielding the great. Those who handle great things with the skill of small ones do not follow their nature or accord with principle; how can they cast off the encumbrance of a mind like tangled mugwort?

Hui Shi again deemed Zhuangzi’s words grand but useless, likening them to the great catalpa—knowing only the use of the useful, not the use of the useless. Zhuangzi replied that the wildcat and weasel, small yet useful, cannot escape misfortune; the yak, large yet useless, suffers no harm from other creatures. Thus, the use of the useful is not as good as the use of the useless. The great catalpa is useless, but if planted in a place of uselessness, the planter may wander carefree, and the tree itself escapes the axe’s bite and the toil of being shifted between profit and harm or battered by worldly custom—how can these be spoken of in the same breath?

Chen Bixu’s note: Some things are unsuited to worldly use, and people readily discard them, not understanding the use of the useless. Thus, things have no fixed size or refinement—it lies in man’s skillful use. Later, the parable of the great catalpa further illustrates the useless: the wildcat and weasel, nimble and clever, perish in traps; the yak, lacking skill, preserves its life. Quick wit invites calamity, dullness preserves the self—this has long been so! Earlier, the roc and the quail were discussed as creatures of feeling, their carefree wandering valued for their soaring freedom. Here, the gourd and catalpa are used to show the carefree wandering of the unfeeling, the essence lying in avoiding harm and loss. Those who grasp this truth find goodness in every direction.

Wang Xiu’s note: The *Da Tong* doubts the uniqueness of the passage yet refines its phrasing.

Zhao Xuchi’s note: Hui Shi questioned Zhuangzi about the great gourd and great tree as useless, and Zhuangzi answered with the salve for chapped hands and the yak to clarify the use of the useless.

Lin Fuzhai’s *Oral Exegesis*: The *zun* is a floating gourd tied to the waist to cross midstream. If one loses a boat, a single gourd is worth a thousand gold—this is what is meant. Zhuangzi, having used the salve for chapped hands to illustrate Hui Shi’s ignorance of proper use, then said: with such a great gourd, why not consider making a floating vessel for rivers? A "mugwort-mind" is one whose heart is blocked like overgrown mugwort. Hui Shi again mocked Zhuangzi’s words with the swollen catalpa, and Zhuangzi replied that the wildcat and weasel, though small, are trapped by their cunning, while the yak, though large, preserves its life through lack of skill. He meant that things, whether great or small, have different aptitudes—one cannot deem all great things useless. "Wuhe" and "Guangmo" refer to the spontaneity of creation and the center of the supreme Way, where there is a place of joy. Though useless to the world, one may yet escape misfortune.

Chu Guan’s *Superficial Insights*: Creation generates things, filling heaven and earth, and their usefulness or uselessness depends on the moment’s encounter—whether they grow in a forest or not is secondary. Thus, some are used in the past but discarded now, or discarded now but used later—this arises from human action, not the thing’s inherent nature. Observe the straw dogs of sacrifice, the scattered remnants of Zhu and Chen—this is evident. Moreover, the gourd of King Wei of Liang was unlike ordinary seeds; those who saw it were astonished and could not fathom its use. No wonder Hui Shi found it strange and questioned it. Zhuangzi, knowing Hui Shi’s clumsiness with great things, used the salve for chapped hands to illustrate. Things are fundamentally the same, yet their value may differ tenfold, a hundredfold, or a thousandfold—it lies in whether one uses them well or poorly. People are often skilled in using small things, and the world readily embraces the small—what they achieve is thus limited. The world is often clumsy with great things, and some grow complacent in guarding the great—what they hoard is thus evident. A five-*dan* gourd, grown to maturity, is not the work of a single morning. Yet now, not only can it not fulfill its great use, but it is battered and discarded—how unfortunate for this gourd! All exceptional things are endowed by the qi of creation; their uselessness may yet await a purpose. Since it is too large to be split for household use, one should consider preserving it whole for use on rivers and lakes, aiding deep crossings and matching the function of boats and oars—then the gourd’s uselessness becomes its wondrous use. Hui Shi, with all his resourcefulness, did not think of this, his mind blocked like mugwort. He again mocked Zhuangzi’s grand words as useless, comparing them to the swollen catalpa, unfit for compass or square. Zhuangzi replied that the wildcat and weasel, clever and swift, die in traps, while the yak, lacking skill, preserves its life—what a difference in gain and loss! Now you have a great tree, yet instead of planting it in a place of uselessness to enjoy carefree wandering, you fret that carpenters will not notice it—this is what Master Nanhua deeply laments. Thus, he seized the question to correct Hui Shi, freeing him from the shackles of form and tools, preserving his nature and life in emptiness and mystery, transcending action to enter non-action, and achieving great use through uselessness. This is the essence of the *Free and Easy Wandering*.

The *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter is vast and profound, its allusions lofty and far-reaching, its language boundless, its meaning sublime. Reading it, one seems to ride the cool wind and ascend the boundless, forgetting worldly cares to roam the heavens. Truly, it is the grand rule for surpassing conventional meanings, breaking through barriers, untying knots, and releasing bonds—the swift path to penetrating the mysterious and investigating the subtle.

Bo Xiu, unworthy as he is, has ventured his humble insights and appended a general discussion at the end: Those who follow the supreme principle harmonize the Way with all affairs; those who preserve their true nature unite with things in oneness.

Where the heavenly principle is attained, yet one remains un-*Free and Easy*—such a case has never existed. The infant’s heart is originally without knowledge; knowledge grows with the body, and as things present themselves, gains and losses lodge in the mind, where ice and fire clash. Abandoning this to serve that, there is no respite. Unless one illuminates principle with perfect clarity and lets the Dao and righteousness prevail, even those of utmost nobility or wealth cannot escape this fate.

Thus, the essential task in studying the Way is first to seek the joy of the sages and worthies, to investigate it with one’s own body, and only then will one gain true strength. The *Book of Changes* says: “Find joy in Heaven and know destiny.” Yan Hui delighted in his gourd bowl, Mencius nurtured his vastness until it filled Heaven and Earth, and Yuan Xian sang as he walked, his voice ringing like metal and stone—all transcended the burdens of external things, preserved the Heaven within themselves, and in every action or stillness, found nothing that was not joy. Only then can one speak of the *Free and Easy Wandering*.

The leviathan of the Northern Darkness transforms into the roc, striking the wind and beating the water as it migrates to the Southern Darkness. This illustrates how scholars, confined by narrow learning and petty aspirations, fail to perceive the profound clarity of the sea of nature or recognize the pearl of destiny that has already sunk and been lost. Thus, Zhuangzi presents this great creature, born in vastness, to clarify our own origins. With long cultivation, body and spirit merge in transformation, moving between yin and yang, their function unfathomable. Those who “know enough to hold one office, compare their conduct to one village, match their virtue to one lord, or win the trust of one state” will awaken to the lightness of external things and the weight of their own Heaven. Then they will see themselves nurtured by the wind, soaring above the clouds, and merging with the boundless transformation. What worldly cares could ever reach them?

Thus, only when one “rides Heaven and Earth, harnesses the six qi, and roams the infinite” does one attain the ultimate *Free and Easy Wandering*. The most divine and sagely, too, are but those who merge and transform as one—fame and merit are merely external things. The chapter where Yao offers the throne to Xu You serves to confirm this principle, inspire the spirit of humility and deference, awaken later generations, and sever their longing for external bonds, greatly benefiting the Way of governance.

When Jian Wu hears the words of Jie Yu, the secrets of the spirit-person are expounded to illustrate the utmost numinosity within the body. The task is to grasp, preserve, and nurture it to attain this state—it is not to be sought afar. “Dust and grime, husks and chaff, can mold a Yao or Shun”: the virtue of the spirit-person moves in harmony with Heaven. Extending its residue alone suffices to bring about the governance of Tang and Yu, yet its true essence is beyond the ken of ordinary people.

When Yao went to visit the Four Masters on the distant Guye Mountain, the wondrous principle there defies conjecture. One must personally visit the Four Masters of Guye to understand without words—scholars, take heed!

This chapter begins by discussing the leviathan, the roc, the cicada, the young dove, the spiritual plant, and the morning mushroom, showing that whether in short or long years, all are discourses on exhausting principle. At the end, it presents the great gourd that preserves itself through emptiness and the great tree that secures itself through deep roots, illustrating the fulfillment of one’s nature to the utmost of destiny. This is the great accomplishment in studying the Way, entering the realm of the spirit. Swift without haste, arriving without movement—where could one go that would not be the *Free and Easy Wandering*?

*Commentary on the Meaning of the True Classic of Southern Florescence*, *Volume One of the Ocean of Subtleties*, concludes.

*Volume Two of the Collected Subtleties on the Meaning of the True Classic of Southern Florescence*
By Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin

**Chapter One: On the Equality of Things**

Nanguo Ziqi, leaning on his armrest, sat in repose. Gazing upward, he exhaled deeply, his spirit seeming to have lost its counterpart. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, "What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, and the heart like dead ashes? Yet the one who now leans on the armrest is not the same as the one who did so before."

Ziqi replied, "Yan, is this not well asked? Today, I have lost my self—do you understand? You have heard the *human pipes*, but not the *earthly pipes*; you have heard the *earthly pipes*, but not the *heavenly pipes*!"

Ziyou said, "May I ask the method?"

Ziqi said, "The great clod breathes forth *qi*, and its name is wind. It does nothing of itself, but when it arises, the myriad hollows roar in fury. Have you alone not heard its ceaseless murmuring? The towering forests and mighty trees, with hollows a hundred spans around—some like noses, some like mouths, some like ears, some like beams, some like rings, some like mortars, some like pools, some like marshes; some whistling, some wailing, some shrieking, some inhaling, some crying, some wailing, some roaring, some gnashing. The first sings *yu*, and the followers sing *mo*. A gentle breeze brings a small harmony; a violent gale, a great harmony. When the fierce wind subsides, all hollows fall silent. Have you alone not seen their trembling and swaying?"

Ziyou said, "The *earthly pipes* are these myriad hollows; the *human pipes* are the bamboo flutes. May I ask about the *heavenly pipes*?"

Ziqi said, "The wind blows in ten thousand different ways, yet each makes itself so. All take of themselves—who is it that stirs them?"

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
To unite with heaven and humanity, forgetting self and other, is to dissolve into emptiness, as if one has lost one’s match. "Withered wood" and "dead ashes" describe a state of stillness and passionlessness—standing like a withered tree, moving like drifting dust. In their bearing, whether in motion or stillness, I cannot be one with them; in their self-so spontaneity, I cannot be two. If the self is already lost, what thing remains to be known?

Flutes and pipes vary in length, their notes—*gong* and *shang*—follow different scales, thus producing sounds of myriad differences in pitch and duration. Yet the measure they receive is one, each taking of itself—here is revealed the *heavenly pipes* of heaven and earth. The great clod exhales its breath—what thing is there? Heaven and earth are but a clod, exhaling of themselves.

The roaring of ten thousand hollows, the diverse apertures of trees, the varied sounds of all apertures—none fail to accord with what they receive. *Tiaotiao* and *diaodiao* describe the wind’s near-stilling, its faintest stirring. Above, the *human pipes* and *earthly pipes* are made clear; Ziyou then asks of the *heavenly pipes*. Ziqi says: "The wind blows in ten thousand different ways, yet each makes itself so"—this is the *heavenly pipes*. Are the *heavenly pipes* some separate thing? They are but the *human pipes* and *earthly pipes*, meeting with the class of living beings and together forming one heaven. Living things are clods that live of themselves—it is not I who give them life. Since I cannot give life to things, things cannot give life to me. That which is so of itself is called *natural*. Does this refer to the azure expanse?

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:**
That by which a person has form and mind is simply the presence of a self. If there were no self, one would be like dead ashes or withered wood—nothing extraordinary. Ziyou does not know whence the self arises, is enslaved by form and mind without respite, and does not understand how one might reach such a state. Yet in the *tara* interval between past and present, he perceives the difference between leaning on the armrest then and now—his observation is thus discerning. In the past, leaning on the armrest was a time of responding to things; now, it is a time of leaving things behind. If one knows whence the self arises, then presence and absence have never not been in one’s own hands. The bamboo flute is a thing—all people hear it and know its hollowness, its emptiness. That by which I am I is likewise so. What difference is there between the roaring of ten thousand hollows and the time when one has a self and is enslaved by form and mind? What difference is there between the hollowness of all apertures and the time when one has lost the self and is like withered wood or dead ashes?

It is said: "Yet you alone do not hear, do not see"—the arising of the *earthly pipes* is only what you have ever heard and seen; the arising and ceasing of the mind is what you have never heard or seen. By investigating what you have heard and seen to fathom what you have never heard or seen, the *heavenly pipes* may be known.

**Lin Yi’s *Duyi* Commentary:**
The wind emerges from emptiness, seeking without trace, arising from stillness and returning to stillness, born from nothingness and returning to nothingness. Only the differences in what the apertures receive vary. What people hear also differs; compared to the myriad things’ endowments, it is the same. All apertures are sounded by the wind; all forms are enslaved by transformation. If the wind cannot sound, then all apertures are empty; if transformation cannot enslave, then all things rest. As for that which has no sound and no aperture, the wind cannot enter it—this is what Liezi calls *yidu*.

**Wang Pang’s Commentary** (following Lin’s interpretation):
The *human pipes* arise from being made so; the *heavenly pipes* have that which is natural. Who is it that abides in and embodies them? Each takes of itself in its roaring—nothing more. The sundial has its constant measure, yet those who grieve or rejoice see it as varying in length. The moon’s movement has its constant path, yet those who observe its waxing and waning see it as racing east and west. The wind blows in ten thousand different ways, yet each takes of itself—how is this different? This is why it is called the *heavenly pipes*. The wind, being empty, enters well; apertures, being empty, receive well. Pipes arise from emptiness alone. Observing things through emptiness, all things are equal; observing things through fullness, all things differ.

**Chen Bixu’s Commentary:**
The wind in heaven and earth is like the *yuanqi* in the human body—this is non-action, like the state of *zuowang*. The roaring of ten thousand hollows is like the time of human activity. Only because the apertures differ do the sounds of the pipes vary so widely—yet this too arises from the natural. Examining the naturalness of the three pipes, the principle returns to the profound stillness of *zuowang*.

**Zhao Xuzhai’s Commentary:**
Sounds emerge from all apertures—who truly rouses them? There is that which gives rise to sounds within them, yet it cannot be heard or seen. This is the *heavenly pipes* within the *earthly pipes*. The *human pipes* are likewise, yet not fully encompassed by bamboo flutes. Thus, the later chapter compares them to knowing, speaking, dreaming, waking, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness—day and night succeeding one another without knowing their origin. The origin is the beginning of life. Morning and evening obtain this, whence life arises—this is the heaven of pipes, the so-called *true master* and *true lord*, which is the same idea.

**Lin Yongzhai’s *Kouyi* Commentary:**
This passage in Zhuangzi is a marvel within marvels. The ancients said poetry is a painting with sound, meaning it can depict scenes that are hard to describe. Yet no painting has ever captured sound. From "rushing" to "whistling," eight words describe eight sounds. *Yu* and *yong* are their harmonizing sounds. The wind between heaven and earth is formless and shadowless, a sound that can be heard but not seen—yet it is brought forth from the tip of the brush. This is why it is marvelous.

**Chu Guan’s *Guanjian* Commentary:**
Examining the above text: "One’s form can surely be made like withered wood"—this is stated directly. "Can one’s mind surely be made like dead ashes?"—this is asked in return. Ziqi says: "Now I have lost my self." Knowing it is "I" means the mind does not respond like dead ashes—there is a true self present. This is the principle of extinguishing movement but not extinguishing illumination. Ziyou asks for the method, and the answer is the great clod exhaling its breath, merely illustrating it with the *earthly pipes*. When asked again, Ziqi then says: "The wind blows in ten thousand different ways, yet each makes itself so." Only here is the true mechanism of the *heavenly pipes* revealed. Alas, Ziyou knows that form can be withered but the mind cannot be ashes—this is the true self—yet he does not realize this is the heaven of pipes.

The heart is the lord of heaven, and the *lai* (pipes) are the function of this heart. All that is used to extend knowledge, investigate things, respond to opportunities, and adapt to changes—manifesting in words and actions—are of this nature. It need not be perceived as sound to be called *lai*. The lord may sit in upright repose, doing nothing, but must never lose his position for a single day. The heart may be still and thoughtless, but must never be extinguished for even a moment. Though the heart makes no sound, that which gives rise to sound resides within it, like a bell or drum suspended, known before it is struck. The deluded cling to the arising and ceasing of forms, thus their perception of sound is intermittent.

The *lai* of humans and earth have movement and stillness; the *lai* of heaven is natural, transcending both movement and stillness, possessing a true master and true lord, the true ruler of all sounds and perceptions. Later in the text, it speaks of "not being blown," and "the speaker has words"—this is so. The common people, in their daily lives, remain unaware, entangled in interactions, exhausting their spirit and vitality, and thus suffer from the disorder of things. This is like carrying firewood to extinguish a fire.

If scholars can turn inward and seek, grasping their true direction, then examining inwardly within themselves and observing outwardly among things, they will find that beginning and end each accord with their root source, and the great and small all harmonize in unity. How could there be any disorder? In examining the meaning of the *great clod*, Guo Xiang says it is "no-thing." Master Cheng comments: "It is the Creator." This too is a name for the natural. It is also called "heaven." Now, the original text states that the *great clod* bears me with form, and the *Liezi* says: "The earth is but accumulated clods." Interpreting it as earth may be close in meaning. Yet this *great clod* seems to refer to the exhalation of qi between heaven and earth, which is what the *Daodejing* calls "like a bellows." The mechanism of opening and closing, the root of yin and yang, the primordial qi transforming and operating therein—this is what stirs and animates the myriad things, causing them to surge, sway, shake, and flourish.

On a grand scale, it can lift houses, uproot trees, shatter mountains, and raise seas—these are its violent outbursts. When its mechanism halts and the *lai* ceases, all returns to silence and nothingness. Where then are the things it once stirred? The true person uses this to illustrate the arising and ceasing of the heart—this is a most profound insight. Yet what causes this arising and ceasing lies in a person’s focused thought and skillful inquiry.

The great knowledge is leisurely, the small knowledge is petty; great words blaze, small words chatter. In sleep, the hun-souls intermingle; when awake, the body opens. Entangled in interactions, one battles daily with the heart. The careless, the cunning, the secretive—small fears make them tremble, great fears leave them dazed. Their outbursts are like the release of a crossbow trigger—this is what is meant by "controlling right and wrong." Their restraint is like a sworn oath—this is what is meant by "guarding it." Their decline is like autumn and winter, speaking of their daily dissipation. Their drowning in their pursuits makes them irrecoverable. Their weariness is like a sealed letter, speaking of their aged exhaustion. The heart near death cannot be revived.

Joy, anger, sorrow, fear, delight, thought, sighing, change, compassion, coquetry, wantonness, charm, and affectation—these arise from emptiness like music from a hollow, or steam forming mushrooms. Day and night they alternate before us, yet none knows whence they sprout. Alas! Alas! If by dusk one grasps this, it is the very source from which life arises! Without that, there is no self; without the self, nothing is grasped. This is nearly so, yet none knows what moves it. As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found? One may act with self-assurance, yet its form remains unseen. Does it have essence but no form?

The hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera—all are complete within me. To which should I feel closest? Do you delight in all of them equally? Or do you favor some? Are they all like ministers and servants? Are these ministers and servants insufficient to govern one another? Do they take turns ruling as lord and subject? Or is there a true lord residing within? Whether one seeks and finds its nature or not, does it add or diminish one’s truth?

Once receiving its completed form, it does not perish until its end. It grinds and wears against things, its course racing on like a gallop, with none able to halt it—is this not sorrowful? A lifetime of toil, yet no success is seen. Exhausted and weary, with no place to return—is this not lamentable? People call this not dying, but what does it profit? The body transforms, the heart follows suit—can this not be called great sorrow?

Guo Xiang’s Commentary:
To know that waking and sleeping differ, that interactions and fears take varied forms, that decline and dissipation occur daily, that drowning in pursuits leads to irreversible loss—all these shifts of nature and events alternate day and night, as if a true master exists yet leaves no trace. Clearly, all things are self-so, with nothing compelling them to be so. Now, the one who acts trusts that action is possible; when essence matches its object, form does not appear distinct. Then the hundred bones, nine orifices, and all else are entrusted to spontaneity, and none fails to delight in them. Yet if there is partiality, high and low encroach upon one another, and none serves as minister or servant. The division of lord and subject is like heaven’s height and earth’s lowness—placed where they naturally belong. The true lord allows things to be thus of themselves, without artifice. To nearly grasp true nature and employ what is self-so—whether knowing or not, all remains at ease. Yet the wise guard their knowledge to await the end, while the foolish cling to ignorance until death. Opposing and aligning forces intertwine, each trusting their own bias, indulging their conduct without self-reflection. This, compared to the sorrow of the multitude, is indeed sorrowful. Yet people never regard this as sorrow—it is simply the nature of things. Each thing is so by nature; what is there to lament?

Thus, a lifetime of toil, weariness, and exhaustion—though alive, it is in truth no different from death. The greatness of this sorrow is such that people never consider it sorrowful. Then what is lamented is not truly lamentable.

Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:
*Xianxian* and *jianjian* clarify the difference between great and small. Sleeping, waking, engaging, and entangling show the differences among the careless, the cunning, and the secretive. Likes and dislikes lie within, and when things touch them, their eruption is like the release of a crossbow trigger. Names and principles confront the outside, and when things draw them, their restraint is like a sworn oath. This speaks to their differing inclinations and aversions. Their decline like autumn and winter, leaving none able to revive—this speaks to the varying depths of desire.

Joy, anger, sorrow, delight, thought, sighing, change, compassion, coquetry, wantonness, charm, and affectation—these are the differing manifestations of their emotional states. All these are the myriad differences of the blowing wind, yet each moves of itself, like music emerging from emptiness or steam forming mushrooms. Day and night they alternate, yet none knows whence they sprout—this is the work of the heavenly pipe, the non-doing of spontaneity.

Are not the differences in vessels’ sizes, inclinations, aversions, and depths of desire like the varied shapes of cliffs and hollows? Are not the differences in *xian*, *jian*, carelessness, fear, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight like the varied sounds of roaring and murmuring? Music arises from emptiness, steam forms mushrooms—seeking their origin yields nothing, like the wind passing through hollows, producing *tiaotiao* and *diaodiao* sounds with no place to return. From this perspective, where does the self that is the self reside? How can the body not become like withered wood? How can the heart not become like dead ashes?

The difficulty of knowing the heavenly pipe and seeing the true lord lies in utterly losing the self to unite with it in spirit. Grasping this by dusk is to know the source from which life arises—this is to know what cannot be known in its sprouting yet unite with it in spirit. Without finding its trace or seeing its form, one cannot discern what moves it and so searches throughout the body’s frame, knowing it has never had a fixed place.

No part of the person is unloved, yet among the hundred bones and nine orifices, to which should one feel closest? With no single closeness, all become like ministers and servants, with none ruling as lord. If ministers and servants are insufficient to govern one another, they take turns as lord and subject—this is not the true lord. Searching within the body’s frame for what moves it yields nothing, yet the existence of a true lord can be known. All people have a true lord; whether one seeks and finds its nature or not, nothing is added or diminished. Why? It is not that the heartless are distant from it, nor that the heartful are near.

Lin Yidu’s Commentary:
To contend with the myriad things with a mind of utmost restraint is to end only in exhaustion. The careless are shallowly obscured, the cunning deeply so, and the secretive even more so. The crossbow trigger speaks to their eruption, which cannot be retraced. The sworn oath speaks to their restraint, which cannot be seized. Pursuing right and wrong, bound to guarding victory, their essence and qi decline like autumn and winter’s withering. Drowning in profit and desire, they cannot be restored to goodness.

Those from the preceding "flaming brilliance" and "leisurely ease" to Yao, Yi, Qi, and Tai—all discuss those who cannot perceive the Unique: they are enslaved by yin and yang, manifesting these myriad emotional states. Joy emerges from emptiness, thus sound arises from the soundless. Mushrooms form through steaming, thus form is born from the formless. Day and night alternate before us, yet none know their origin; dawn and dusk receive this to live, yet understand not how. Without the true lord, I would not exist; without me, the true lord’s name would have no claim. The true lord issues commands yet acts not; the governor receives the lord’s mandate and exercises governance. As a thing, it belongs neither to yin nor yang, neither within nor without; it may be spiritually apprehended, not sought through images. The utmost of nature and destiny—emotions await the true lord before proceeding, yet the true lord’s form remains unseen.

Of man’s hundred bones and nine orifices, all should follow their natural course. If one cannot forget and instead cherishes them, partiality arises: what pleases becomes lord, what displeases becomes servant or concubine. Servants and concubines cannot govern themselves, so the true lord governs them. The true lord, acting not, dwells in the central void; the hundred limbs and nine orifices serve without awareness. Whether one seeks and finds its nature or not, nothing is added or diminished from its truth. Laozi said: "Abandon learning, and there will be no sorrow"—to seek is of no benefit to attainment.

All things reside within creation, their transformations boundless, yet the true lord remains indestructible. Mortals, having chanced to become human, thus cling to the self, unaware of that which does not perish. Locked in mutual conflict and erosion, they toil like draft animals, their forms and hearts transformed—then all is over. Is this not profoundly lamentable?

Chen Xiangdao’s Commentary:
When knowledge and speech respond to externals, while contention and fear assail within, their eruption brings the burden of right and wrong; their restraint, the obstruction of guarding victory. Their virtue withers to irrecoverable decay, their hearts stifled until yang can no longer return. Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight become mere reactions to things—how could they know what is called "free and unfettered"? Joy emerges from emptiness; steam gives rise to mushrooms. The transformations of yin and yang, the endless alternation of day and night—observing form and sound, their origin is distant indeed! Yet none know where they begin. Observing self and other, it is near at hand!

Yet none know what compels them—thus it seems a true master exists, though no trace of it can be found.

This true master is the functioning of the Dao. The eye sees, the ear hears, the hand grasps, the foot walks—all these I merely preserve, yet who claims them as private possessions? Servants and concubines attend to others yet cannot be truly commanded. When ruler and subject alternate roles, they cannot avoid acting. But where a true lord resides, there has never been action.

When seeing occurs, the eye serves as lord, yet what enables this has a lordship beyond the eye. When walking occurs, the foot serves as lord, yet what enables this has a lordship beyond the foot. All these are inherent to humanity—whether one grasps their essence or not, nothing is added or taken from their truth.

Those who wield the tools of time and entrust themselves to the boundless—how could form alone suffice? The deeply rooted in generative abundance, though existing, do not perish; they drift with things along the paths of right and wrong, until form transforms and the heart follows—this is the greatest sorrow! As it is said: "No sorrow is greater than the death of the heart."

Zhao Xuqi’s Commentary:
Knowledge, speech, sleep, wakefulness, engagement, contention, concealment, secrecy—responding to ten thousand changes, they are like the wind stirring the pipes, blowing myriad differences. That which arises is the initial movement of the mechanism; that which lingers is the retention after movement. Abundance dwindles, growth decays—this is one’s gradual decline. Entering without exit, closing without opening, until exhaustion and final return—this is one’s end. When a fierce wind passes, all hollows become empty—this is what it means to let things follow their own course.

Joy, anger, and the twelve states—arising from emotion, manifesting in voice, sound, and countenance—who causes them thus? Joy emerges from emptiness; mushrooms arise from steam—this clarifies that the twelve states all arise from self-origination. When emotion meets things, rising and falling follow one another, their origin unknown. All that is born from nothingness has a master residing within nothingness. Morning and evening obtain this source of generation—this is the heaven of the pipes. Without it, there is no self. As the *Doctrine of the Mean* says: "Without sincerity, there is no thing," yet without things, sincerity cannot be revealed. Thus it is said: "Without me, there is nothing to grasp." These words nearly approach the Dao.

Not knowing who truly compels them, it is as if a true master resides within, yet no beginning can be sought.

Faith is to follow one’s nature in action. Emotion is the manifestation of nature. Nature itself is formless and invisible. Within a person’s body, the hundred bones and nine orifices cannot be of one accord—whom then should I hold dear? Where lies partiality? It is said that within must reside a true sovereign, only then can all be governed. The benevolent see it as benevolence, for they grasp its essence. The common people use it daily yet remain unaware, for they do not grasp its essence. Whether grasped or not, the true sovereign remains undiminished and unaugmented. Once this form is received, the form may perish, but nature does not vanish. Yet people of the world, bewildered by right and wrong, profit and harm, know no rest, willingly rotting with the grasses and trees—how lamentable!

The *Oral Teachings of Lu Zhai* states: The man of great wisdom moves with ease and self-possession; the man of petty wisdom counts every star and weighs every ounce. Grand words blaze brightly, radiant with splendor. In this single phrase lies the intent of Zhuangzi, encompassing even Yi, Zhou, Kong, and Meng. Petty words chatter on, glancing ahead and behind—within this single phrase lie the doctrines of the Hundred Schools and the gossip of the marketplace. When spirits commune, the spirit gathers in the heart; when form unfolds, the four limbs all move. These two phrases encompass all, from emperors to commoners. It speaks of how, at night, one rests in sleep, yet at dawn, in the moment of encounter, one responds and engages, the mind toiling as if in battle—this is what Mencius meant by "what one does by day may fetter and lose it."

"Loose" refers to slackness and irrelevance. "Cunning" implies speech laden with traps. "Subtle" denotes deep thought, leaving no trace. This describes how those who respond to things with their minds are all beset by worry, fear, and lack of freedom—what is called "the petty man is ever anxious." Confucius spoke of the petty man as anxious. Zhuangzi’s intent, however, is that even Yao, Shun, Yu, and Kong were anxious. Debates focus on right and wrong, like an archer aiming at a target. The desire to prevail hardens the heart, unyielding as a sworn oath. Yet the mind, consumed by care and toil, withers day by day, month by month. Once ensnared by obsession, there is no return. Such people, though their bodies live briefly, their hearts are already beyond revival.

The above depicts the worldly mind’s inclinations—joy, anger, and the twelve other states. It further describes their shifting appearances, like music emerging from emptiness or mushrooms steaming into being, all shaped by the Creator. This is the "blowing of the ten thousand differences." Day and night alternate, speaking of the Creator’s comings and goings, yet no origin is seen. Between dawn and dusk, one merely obtains this source of life. This points to the Creator as non-Creator; without it, I cannot exist. The Creator’s work is revealed through people. Such reasoning seems near and visible, yet what compels people to perceive the Creator remains unknown. The true sovereign is the Creator. "As if" suggests one dare not assert its actual existence. "No trace" means its beginnings are unknowable. The Creator’s actions are indeed real, yet its form remains unseen. Thus, no one knows what compels it.

"Having emotion" speaks of reality, that is, faith. From "day and night alternate" onward, it describes the Creator’s work, though ever-present, unseen by people. It urges one to reflect deeply here. The hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera—all are complete in a person. Whom then should I uniquely favor with private delight? When the head aches, the hand scratches—then the hand serves the head. When the eyes look, the feet walk—then the feet serve the eyes. The servant is like a concubine, unfit to govern. Hands, feet, ears, eyes, nose, and mouth serve one another, with the served as ministers and the serving as lords. Since the lordship of the hundred parts cannot be fixed, the heart, as the master of the body, should be deemed the lord. Yet the heart cannot govern itself; what governs it is the Creator—thus, the Creator is the true sovereign. Seeking thus, one wishes to see the truth clearly. Yet whether seen or not, the so-called true sovereign remains unchanged.

Once a person receives form from the Creator, they guard it without loss until this form perishes. Yet unable to yield, they are overwhelmed by external things. Their entire life passes like a fleeting colt, toiling in vain—how can this not be lamentable? As the form decays—from decline to whitening, from whitening to aging—the body weakens, and the heart grows weary, for the heart follows its form. Can this not be called a great sorrow? A profound sigh for what cannot be saved.

The above *Collected Explanations* are clear and need no repetition. Among them, the eight characters—*lǜ* (deliberation), *tàn* (sighing), *biàn* (change), *zhé* (submission), *yáo* (flippancy), *yì* (indulgence), *qǐ* (opening), and *tài* (attitude)—flow spontaneously from the true person’s lips, unmatched in other texts. Most commentaries fall short. Only Master Cheng’s commentary states: *Lǜ* is forethought of the future; *tàn* is lament for the past; *biàn* is altering old matters; *zhé* is submission without resistance. The explanations of *lǜ* and *tàn* are indeed excellent, yet the meanings of *biàn* and *zhé* remain unclear. Here, I propose: *biàn* is restlessness and busyness; *zhé* is fear and immobility. This may fully capture the text’s intent.

The commentary further states: *Yáo* is frivolity; *yì* is extravagance; *qǐ* is the opening of desires; *tài* is seductive charm. This seems inadequate for the above text. Here, I propose: *Yáo* is self-indulgence in pleasure; *yì* is reckless abandon; *qǐ* is the opening of emotion to receive things; *tài* is arrogance and longing. It speaks of those who, in pursuing things and forgetting themselves, exhibit these varied states within a single body—calculating gains and losses, scorched by fire and frozen by ice. Thus, body and heart decay together, daily nearing death.

Yet how could this be inherent in our nature? It arises from drowning in worldly desires, from the inversion of emotions and consciousness—forgetting what ought not be forgotten, clinging to what ought be forgotten. It is like music emerging from emptiness, like steam giving rise to mushrooms: illusory as dust, bubbles, shadows, flickering into being and vanishing in an instant—how could such things matter? The vast expanse of the heart should recognize that which is profoundly still, utterly silent, enduring since ancient times without cease.

This turmoil is but a shifting realm of dust, a fleeting illusion; once seen through, it dissolves. Returning to examine the self and the world, one finds their origin in primordial nothingness, a temporary sojourn in this realm. For now, we repay the debts of past karma, severing the roots of birth from the fertile earth, inheriting the primal qi of the cosmic mother. Neither grasping nor rejecting, ever pure and ever still—though the body dwells in the clamor of the world, the spirit transcends into the sacred realm. How could worldly burdens ever reach it?

Is human life truly so deluded? Am I alone in this delusion, or are there those who are not? If one follows the inclinations of the heart as one’s teacher, who is without a teacher? Why must one wait for knowledge to be passed down before the heart claims it for itself? Fools, too, share in this! To assert right and wrong before the heart is fully formed is like arriving in Yue today yet claiming to have reached it yesterday. Thus, one takes what is not as what is.

Taking what is not as what is—even the divine Yu could not comprehend it; how then could I? Speech is not mere breath. Those who speak have their words, yet what they speak of remains unsettled. Is there truly speech? Or has there never been speech? Does it differ from the chirping of fledglings? Is there discernment in it? Or is there no discernment?

Where does the Dao conceal itself to give rise to truth and falsehood? Where does speech conceal itself to give rise to right and wrong? Where does the Dao go that it ceases to exist? Where does speech abide that it cannot be trusted? The Dao is obscured by partial attainment; speech is obscured by florid ornamentation. Thus arise the disputes of the Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other denies and denying what the other affirms. To affirm what they deny and deny what they affirm, nothing surpasses illumination.

Nothing exists that is not "that"; nothing exists that is not "this." From the perspective of "that," one does not see; from self-knowledge, one knows. Thus it is said: "That" emerges from "this," and "this" likewise depends on "that." The theory of "that" and "this" arising together is born. Yet even as they arise, they die; even as they die, they arise. Even as something becomes permissible, it becomes impermissible; even as it becomes impermissible, it becomes permissible. Through "this" comes "right," through "wrong" comes "right."

Therefore, the sage does not proceed by such means but illuminates all by the light of Heaven—this, too, is a form of "this." "This" is also "that," and "that" is also "this." "That" has its own right and wrong, and "this" has its own right and wrong.

Does "that" and "this" truly exist? Or do "that" and "this" truly not exist? Where "that" and "this" find no counterpart, this is called the pivot of the Dao. Once the pivot finds the center of the ring, it responds without end. "Right" is one endless cycle; "wrong" is likewise one endless cycle. Thus it is said: nothing compares to illumination.

Guo Xiang’s Commentary:
Now, those who know do not know how they know yet know spontaneously. Those who live do not know how they live yet live spontaneously. Thus it is said: none in the world are not deluded. That by which the human heart suffices to govern the uses of the body is called the "completed heart." Following one’s completed heart as teacher means each has their own master, entrusting it to what is naturally fitting, thereby completing what was incomplete—this is not knowledge but the heart’s own attainment. Thus even the foolish follow their completed heart, never employing what they deem short while discarding what they deem long. To have right and wrong before the completed heart is formed is like saying one arrived in Yue today when one arrived yesterday. Clearly, right and wrong cannot be absent from the turning of things. Therefore, the perfected person accords with both. In principle, there is no right or wrong, yet the deluded take them to exist. This is to take what is not as what is. Once the deluded heart is formed, even the sage cannot undo it. Speakers each have what they affirm, hence their difference from mere sound. "I am right, that is wrong"—if this is taken as having speech, it is insufficient to settle anything; if taken as having no speech, it still relies on this to have speech. Speech and the sound of a wheel’s hub, whether articulated or not, cannot be definitively settled. The sentiments of the world are never uniform, yet what is spoken cannot differ. As for the Dao, it does not reside in speech—where is it hidden so as to have truth and falsehood, right and wrong? Not knowing that this Dao is entirely present and entirely permissible, one clings to minor achievements and flourishing displays, which obscure the Dao. Yet the Dao cannot be obscured. Thus truth and falsehood, right and wrong, operate in flourishing displays but halt at what is truly fitting; they appear in minor achievements but vanish in great wholeness. Confucians and Mohists each affirm and negate the other, each prizing their own views. Now, to affirm what Confucians and Mohists negate and negate what they affirm, nothing compares to using their own reversals to illuminate them. Then one knows that what they affirm is not truly right, and what they negate is not truly wrong. All things affirm themselves, thus none are not "this." All things oppose each other, thus none are not "that." Without "that" and without "this," this is called profound sameness. All things do not know what "that" sees but only know what they themselves know, taking themselves as right and thus taking "that" as wrong. It is like the living, who take life as life, while the dead take life as death—permissible and impermissible are likewise. Thus in the debates of Confucians and Mohists, I cannot agree. As for each obscuring their own distinctions, I cannot disagree. Following the world’s right and wrong, right and wrong are never inappropriate. If "this" is also "that," then I am opposed by "that." If "that" is also "this," then "that" takes itself as right. "That" and "this," being and non-being—none are definitively settled. Right and wrong chase each other, reversing endlessly, called the "ring." The ring is empty at its center. Now, taking right and wrong as the ring and attaining its empty center, there is no right and no wrong, thus one can respond to right and wrong. Right and wrong are endless, thus the response is likewise endless.

Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:
When I contend with things, form and heart transform without my awareness—this is the height of delusion. The perfected person’s heart is still as a mirror, not requiring anything to be so, simply attaining its completed heart. I do not attain my completed heart, hence my singular delusion. The perfected person is fundamentally not deluded. If one can truly follow one’s completed heart as teacher, who would lack a teacher? Why must one know to replace old habits when the heart naturally takes what it does? The foolish share in this; not being deluded yet able to be teachers, they simply do not seek it. The completed heart is what we receive from Heaven without deficiency, thus it suffices to clarify true right and wrong. If it is deficient due to things, then the so-called right and wrong are not settled. Taking what is fundamentally without right and wrong as having them, even the divine Yu could not resolve it. What can I do? Speech is not mere sound; speakers have speech, which is blown by things, not blowing things to make them so. Thus when speech is not settled, whether it is spoken or never spoken, its difference from the sound of a fledgling cannot be discerned. The Dao is nowhere absent, thus speech is never not the Dao. Where is the Dao hidden so as to have truth and falsehood? Things are never not the Dao, thus speech is also the Dao. Where is speech hidden so as to have right and wrong? Knowing the Dao is nowhere absent, where does it not reside? Knowing speech is never not the Dao, where does it not apply? Yet there are places it does not reside and things it does not apply to, for the Dao is obscured by minor achievements and one does not know great wholeness; speech is obscured by flourishing displays and one does not know the original reality. Hence there are the right and wrong of Confucians and Mohists. To affirm what they negate and negate what they affirm, nothing compares to illumination. Illumination is the verification of returning to the mandate and knowing the constant. Now, the right and wrong of Confucians and Mohists do not depart from knowledge and perception yet have never used illumination, thus they are insufficient to be the standard of right and wrong. If one sets aside knowledge and turns the light inward to observe with illumination, then what things call "that" and "this" truly have no fixed substance. Without fixed substance, there is nothing that is not "that," nothing that is not "this." From "that," one does not see, thus taking "that" as "that." From self-knowledge, one knows, thus taking oneself as right. The argument from "that" is likewise, thus "this" fundamentally has no fixed substance. Yet the world takes it as having "that"—this is like the living taking life as life while the dead take death as life, thus taking what is not as what is. From the perspective of the Dao, when things are living, seeking whence their life comes; when dying, seeking whither their death goes.

To know that life and death are of one body is to see that what is just born is precisely what will just die, and what is just dying is precisely what was just born. So too with right and wrong. All these are but fabrications of our minds. Exhaust the mind and fathom the spirit, return to a state beyond self, and their substance is never different. Thus, what is "right" follows from "wrong," and what is "wrong" follows from "right"—they merely alternate in function.

The sage does not follow these paths but illuminates them by the light of Heaven; this is what is meant by "illumination." Lin Yi’s annotation: Amidst the obscurity of human life, the true nature that is never obscured is not absent—it is merely veiled by things and unknown to itself. The sage does not tread the paths of right and wrong, but forgets cares, stills thoughts, and illuminates by the light of Heaven. Yet what the sage illuminates is only because the world has right and wrong. Thus it is said: "It also follows from right." Taking this as right is also what the other takes as other; taking that as wrong, the other also takes itself as right. Between this and that, each has its own right and wrong. Zhuangzi seeks to clarify that there is no fixed "this" or "that" and does not determine their reasons. Thus, he borrows the words of Guo and Ju to speak of being and non-being.

Having forgotten "this" and "that," and further forgotten the reasons for "this" and "that," "this" and "that" cannot stand as counterparts to me—this is called the *pivot of the Dao*. The pivot is the mechanism of opening and closing, of turning. The ring is empty yet not divorced from form. The pivot’s substance is round and moves—this is *wondrous existence*. The ring’s substance is round and still—this is *true emptiness*. Wondrous existence and true emptiness mutually support and function together, thus responding endlessly. Without the utmost clarity in the world, who could attain this?

Chen Xiangdao’s annotation: The human mind is inherently clearer than water or fire. Yet when it races with things and transforms with form, it becomes so obscured as to seem without knowledge—this is the covering of *ignorance*. What obscures is the human; what does not obscure is Heaven. Those who nurture the mind well do not let the human extinguish Heaven but preserve what is not obscured. Human life is such that Heaven bestows form, and the Dao bestows the mind. If one follows the mind as it is formed and takes it as a teacher, one darkly accords with the Dao. Why must there be those who know change and take the mind for themselves? Change refers to the transformations of yin and yang. To know change and take the Dao for the mind is to be a knower. Everyone has a formed mind that can be taken as a teacher—why must only the knower be so? Without a formed mind, to have right and wrong is to take non-being as being.

Adorning one’s words with flourish, even a divine Yu could not comprehend them—how much less one who is not a divine Yu? The human mind, when honored by the Dao, becomes a ruler; when sought by the Dao, becomes a teacher. With a mind of right and wrong as one’s teacher, right is right and wrong is wrong, and knowledge is complete. With a mind of right and wrong as one’s servant, right becomes wrong and wrong becomes right, and one returns to folly. The ancients began by taking the mind as teacher and ended by forgetting the mind. Taking the mind as teacher, right and wrong are thus made manifest. Forgetting the mind, right and wrong are thus dissolved.

Words are not like the wind. Words are spoken by speakers, while the wind blows naturally without ceasing. Words arise from debate and are without flaw or blame. The cries of fledglings do not come from what they imitate yet still contain debate. Words begin with speech and end in silence, thus differing from the wind. Debate begins with argument and ends in non-argument, thus differing from the cries of fledglings.

Where does the Dao not go that it is not present? The Dao is fundamentally without concealment, yet it is concealed in minor accomplishments. Where do words not reside that they are not permissible? Words are fundamentally without concealment, yet they are concealed in ornate flourish. Minor accomplishments do not darkly accord with the great Dao, and thus true and false arise. Ornate flourish does not reach actuality, and thus right and wrong become manifest.

Now, to affirm what the Confucians and Mohists reject and return to true right, and to reject what the Confucians and Mohists affirm and return to true wrong—the sage does not follow "this" and "that" but illuminates them by the light of Heaven; this too follows from right. The pivot is what turns and opens or closes. The ring is round and empty, responding well. The pivot finds its center in the ring to turn. The myriad things find their pivot to respond. Thus, right and wrong are entrusted to the two paths and are endless.

Chen Bixu’s annotation: In human life, all are swayed by desires and aversions, their true nature disturbed by right and wrong, obscured and unclear. The perfected person transcends life and death, the wondrous principle shining clearly—how could there be obscurity? Not taking the Dao and ancient laws as teachers but clinging to one’s own views is called a *formed mind*. If one follows the formed mind as a teacher, who lacks a teacher? Everyone has their own teacher, so there is no need for the worthy to replace the unworthy. If one takes the formed mind for oneself and claims to have gained something, then the foolish have many allies. Thus, those who accord with the Dao are one with the Dao, and those who lose it are one with loss.

Before the mind is formed, to have right and wrong is like claiming to arrive before reaching one’s destination—principle is fundamentally non-existent, yet one forcibly calls it existent. Following this existence, existence proliferates endlessly, and even the most virtuous spiritual persons cannot know its reasons. The wind is like a sound. Thus, words differ from it, as each side clings to victory, and there is no fixed speech. Words are for expressing meaning. The wind has no meaning to take. If one does not take meaning from words, how do they differ from the cries of fledglings?

The great Dao is never concealed, yet scholars have true and false. The perfect words are never obscure, yet speakers have right and wrong. The person of the Dao is without gaps—where could they not be? Words transform and all things pass—where could they not reach? When the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness—this is called *minor accomplishment*. When knowledge and wisdom emerge, there is great falsity—this is called *ornate flourish*. Confucianism follows the Zhou and Confucius; Mohism follows Xia and Yu. What the Confucians affirm, the Mohists reject; what the Mohists affirm, the Confucians reject. Now, to affirm what the Confucians reject and reject what the Mohists affirm, there is nothing better than mutual clarification, so that right and wrong of both sides may proceed together.

The nature of things originally has no "that," yet it arises from their opposition. Originally there is no "this," yet it arises from self-assertion. From "that," one does not see—just as Huan, becoming a Confucian, did not see Di as a Mohist. From self-knowledge, one knows—Di’s adherence to Mohism arose from self-assertion, while Huan’s self-affirmation as a Confucian likewise depended on Di’s existence.

"That" and "this," "right" and "wrong" are like those who value life when alive and delight in death when dead. Thus the sage illuminates them through Heaven, not through man, yet one cannot call them nonexistent—they arise from this. "That" and "this" each have their own right and wrong; to seek their ultimate existence or nonexistence is to return to the extremity of forgetting words, where no counterpart can be found—this is called the *pivot of the Dao*.

The pivot is empty at the center, turning without obstruction, like the function of a door hinge, which lies in the socket to respond endlessly. As for the pivot of the Dao, it turns things through principle. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are numerous, none can oppose the subtlety of the Dao’s pivot.

*Xu Zhai’s Commentary*: "Mang" refers to being restless yet unaware of one’s destination—without it, one is not "mang." The *cheng xin* (fully formed heart-mind) is what Zisi called "sincerity that completes itself." This is the original nature; if one can fully realize it, there is nothing it does not penetrate. All people possess this heart-mind—why seek another teacher?

"Dai" refers to the principle of alternation between day and night, life and death. If one can take the *cheng xin* as one’s teacher, this principle becomes self-evident—why seek knowledge like Zilu, who asked about ghosts, spirits, and death? This is merely the desire to know *dai*. Thus Confucius answered with serving others and understanding life, wishing him to grasp it from his own heart-mind.

When principle is not yet clear and one first establishes right and wrong, taking what is not as what is—this is delusion. Even the sage can do nothing about it.

Words are the voice of the heart-mind; blowing is the sound of wind or bamboo. The *kou yin* is the sound of a fledgling trying to break from its egg. Though these three differ, the presence of sound within them is not distinct. When one speaks, there is speech—meaning the moment between intending to speak and not yet speaking, which remains undetermined. Is there truly speech? Then the words have not yet emerged. Is there no speech? Then the words are about to emerge. At this moment, it cannot be discerned—like the *kou yin*.

The Dao is nowhere absent, yet distinctions of true and false arise. Words are never inapplicable, yet divisions of right and wrong emerge. Confucians and Mohists mutually affirm and reject—without illumination, they cannot be distinguished.

Things have no "that" in themselves; things have no "this" in themselves—this is Heaven. "That" is man. Seeking it from man, it cannot be seen. From self-knowledge, one knows it; knowing one’s nature, one knows Heaven. "That" arises from "this"—the formed is born from the formless. "This" also depends on "that"—the formless relies on the formed. The theory of "that" and "this" arising together is like existence and nonexistence, movement and stillness giving rise to one another.

The world is confused by the path of right and wrong, unable to distinguish them. The sage clearly perceives the principle of right and wrong, yet it ultimately amounts to affirming what is right. "That" and "this" depend on each other; existence and nonexistence give rise to one another—they cannot be considered distinct. To find no counterpart is to stand alone beyond "that" and "this," existence and nonexistence—this is the pivotal essence of the Dao.

The pivot resides at the center and governs externally, responding to endless changes like a ring without end—only the wise know this.

*Yongzhai’s Oral Exegesis* says: "Mang" is the appearance of being without insight. Heaven generates the masses, endowing them with things and principles. Heavenly principle is never unclear, but human desires obscure it, leading to confusion. How could one who knows the Dao be like this?

The *cheng xin* is Heavenly principle in its undifferentiated wholeness, complete in all respects. If one can take this as one’s teacher, who lacks it? "Knowing *dai*" is the title of ancient worthies. *Dai* means transformation, referring to understanding the principle of change. "Self-attainment" means having insight. If one cannot perceive this undifferentiated principle yet forcibly distinguishes right and wrong, it is like arriving in Yue today after having set out yesterday—having no real insight yet insisting it exists. Even the sage cannot enlighten such a person.

The blowing of the ten thousand things differs, yet all are merely sound. When sound forms patterns, it becomes speech—distinct from blowing or bamboo. When one speaks, there is speech, each expressing their intent—these four words are the source from which debates over right and wrong arise. Does what is spoken come from you? Or from the Creator? Hence it is said: undetermined. The *kou yin*, having no knowledge, is likewise undetermined.

The Dao originally has no true or false—why does obscurity give rise to such distinctions? Words originally have no right or wrong—why does obscurity give rise to such divisions? The Dao encompasses the small and great, the refined and coarse; words encompass affirming what is right and rejecting what is wrong. "Minor accomplishment" refers to limited understanding and partial views. "Ornate flourish" means self-aggrandizement in pursuit of fame. When partial views prevail, the perfect words are obscured, and from this arise the mutual rejections of Confucians and Mohists.

If one wishes to settle right and wrong, one must illuminate them with natural Heavenly principle. When self and other oppose, right and wrong arise—thus it is said: "That" arises from "this," and "this" also depends on "that," just as life gives way to death, and death in turn gives way to life. The two cannot be separated; it is better to affirm what is right in each. This is why the sage does not adhere to partial views but illuminates them with Heavenly principle, merging self and other into one—grasping the pivotal essence of the Dao. It begins like the emptiness at the center of a ring, responding to things endlessly. Right and wrong are each without end, yet they are illuminated by Heavenly principle alone.

*Note*: Many interpretations take *cheng xin* as good, while others take it as bad. Considering the subsequent text—"before the heart-mind is formed, there is right and wrong," and "this is like arriving in Yue today after having set out yesterday"—the *cheng xin* is where the distinction between right and wrong first sprouts and cannot be spoken of as good.

I once attended the lecture seat of Master Fan Wuyin of Western Shu, where I humbly received his teachings: "Before the *cheng xin* forms, true nature remains undifferentiated, vast as the Great Void. Once the *cheng xin* arises, it departs from nature, giving rise to both good and evil. In worldly interactions, one cannot entirely avoid the *cheng xin*; one should then model oneself on the state prior to its formation, where good and evil do not sprout, and right and wrong leave no trace—how could anything then fail to be harmonized?"

His discourse was precise and sufficient to resolve all prior doubts. Expounding further on my own understanding, I venture to offer this humble insight: For one, halting a thought is not difficult; preventing its continuation is difficult. If, at the very moment the *cheng xin* first forms, one models oneself on the state prior to its formation, then thoughts will not continue, and nature may be restored. Thus, when confronting things, the heart-mind arises; when things are forgotten, nature manifests. The heart-mind is the function of nature, the origin of the myriad dharmas, and the master of the body—it cannot be dismissed as nonexistent. Yet if one speaks of the *cheng xin*, it has already flowed into intention.

The heart-mind, as a thing, moves in and out without fixed time, its abode unknown. Yet whatever the square inch of the heart-mind desires to do invariably arises in response to things. The heart-mind is *li* (detachment); *li* governs fire. Fire cannot manifest on its own but must cling to something before it appears. If the heart-mind is one with the Great Void, it has nothing to cling to. Moreover, if the heart-mind clings to things and produces good, it is still inferior to having no heart-mind and no action—how much worse if it clings to things and produces evil?

Master Guanyin said: "When things come to seek me, vast as boulders, I respond with nature, and things float lightly away." This is the essential Dao of relinquishing things, departing from the person, gathering nature, and returning to nature. Scholars who return to seek it will find it an inexhaustible teacher.

The character *zhi* (知) was formerly pronounced in the departing tone, though some read it in its original tone. The following text, where "the foolish" (*yu zhe*) is paired with "those who possess evidence," suggests that the pronunciation *zhi* (智) is appropriate, akin to *yu* (预). Bi Xu alone, aligning with a faction, differs from the majority.

As for the meaning of *zhi dai* (知代), interpretations vary. Carefully examining the intent of the scripture, *zhi dai* refers to the heart-mind acting on its own, where "knowing" is employed in place of self-seeking in the Dao—this is what is meant by the *cheng xin*.

**Chapter Two: On the Equality of Things**

To illustrate that a finger is not a finger by means of a finger is not as effective as illustrating that a finger is not a finger by means of what is not a finger. To illustrate that a horse is not a horse by means of a horse is not as effective as illustrating that a horse is not a horse by means of what is not a horse. Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.

What is permissible is permissible; what is not permissible is not permissible. The Dao is completed through its practice; things are so called because they are so named. Why are they so? They are so because they are so. Why are they not so? They are not so because they are not so. Things inherently have that which makes them so; things inherently have that which makes them permissible. There is nothing that is not so; there is nothing that is not permissible.

Thus, consider the following examples: mats and pillars, leprosy and Xi Shi, the expansive, the strange, the deceptive, and the monstrous—all are united in the Dao. Their division is their completion; their completion is their destruction. Yet all things are neither completed nor destroyed, for they return to unity. Only the enlightened understand this unity. Therefore, they do not employ it but lodge it in the ordinary.

The ordinary is utility; utility is penetration; penetration is attainment. Attaining this, one approaches the subtlety. Following this without knowing why it is so is called the Dao.

To exhaust one’s spirit in striving for unity while failing to recognize their sameness is called "morning three." What is "morning three"? The monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, "Three in the morning and four in the evening." All the monkeys were angry. He then said, "Very well, four in the morning and three in the evening," and all the monkeys were pleased. The names and realities remained unchanged, yet joy and anger were employed—this too follows from such reasoning.

Therefore, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the equality of heaven. This is called "walking two paths."

Chen Bixu said: The metaphors of finger and horse, from Sima Biao, Xiang Xiu, and Guo Xiang to the renowned scholars of the Tang, were all considered Zhuangzi’s allegorical constructions. Thus, interpreters have differed in their conclusions. Yet upon examining the two treatises, *White Horse* and *Pointing to Things*, within Gongsun Long’s *Six Discourses*, which contain the arguments that a white horse is not a horse and that a finger is not a finger, it becomes clear that Zhuangzi’s enigmatic compositions have their origins.

Guo Xiang’s commentary: To affirm oneself and negate others is the common tendency of the world. If I use my finger to illustrate another’s finger, then that finger becomes a non-finger in relation to mine. Conversely, if I use another’s finger to illustrate mine, then my finger becomes a non-finger in relation to theirs. Both self-affirmation and mutual negation arise from this. These petty distinctions are merely the adherence to partial views. The sage, knowing that heaven and earth are one finger and the myriad things are one horse, abides in vast tranquility, each in its proper place, all attaining self-realization, without further right or wrong.

What is permissible to oneself is called permissible; what is not permissible to oneself is called impermissible. The Dao is never unfulfilled; things are never not so. Each is so in its own way; each is permissible in its own way. Take, for example, mats laid horizontally and pillars standing vertically, leprosy and Xi Shi’s beauty—what is meant by equality is not the uniformity of shapes or the sameness of standards. Thus, the expansive, the strange, the deceptive, and the monstrous are all united in the Dao.

For things, what one considers destruction, another considers completion. What I call completion, another calls destruction—all arise from self-regard and failure to see the other. Only the enlightened are not confined to one perspective; they lodge appropriately in self-utility and thus do not impose their own constructs. Not knowing why one follows and yet following is called the Dao. The Dao is simply unity. For the enlightened, what need is there to labor the spirit in striving for unity? To exhaust one’s spirit in pursuit of unity is no different from failing to achieve it—it is the same as the monkeys’ self-affirmation based on their preferences.

Therefore, the sage does not favor one side but entrusts all to natural equality, allowing the world’s right and wrong to proceed along two paths.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: To illustrate that a finger is not a finger by means of a finger, despite distinctions of name and reality or small and large, does not transcend their shared essence—how could it suffice to prove it a non-finger? To illustrate that a horse is not a horse by means of a horse, despite distinctions of coat color or quality, does not depart from their shared kind—how could it suffice to prove it a non-horse? Only by not relying on right and wrong and illuminating them through heaven can one transcend shared essence and depart from shared kind, thereby determining the true right and wrong of the world.

Thus, though heaven and earth are vast, they are no different from one finger, for they arise with me and share the same essence. Though the myriad things are numerous, they are no different from one horse, for they are one with me and share the same kind. Then how can the permissible and impermissible of things arise on their own?

The Dao is completed through its practice, not through non-action. Things are so called because they are named, not because they are inherently so. Their being so or permissible arises from what is not so or impermissible, yet seeking the agent behind this yields nothing—thus, one knows their fundamental non-existence. This is the equality of things. Why then pursue or abandon them?

Small and large, beauty and ugliness are inherently opposed, yet when united through the Dao, their division becomes their completion, and their completion becomes their destruction. Yet all things are neither completed nor destroyed, for they return to unity. Only the enlightened understand this unity. Thus, I do not employ it but lodge it in the self-utility of things. Lodging in things is penetration; penetration is attainment without obstruction, approaching the Dao. Yet this cannot be considered the Dao, for one still knows why it is so. Only by knowing the formlessness of this and following it without knowing why it is so can it be called the Dao.

The Dao unites all because the origins of small and large, beauty and ugliness lie within it. If one does not know this and labors the spirit in pursuit of it, this is precisely what prevents unity. It is like the morning three and evening four, or morning four and evening three—though the sum remains seven, joy and anger arise. This is how the monkeys are tamed by their keeper, and how the keeper ensnares the monkeys.

Likewise, it is simply by virtue of this. Lin Yi’s solitary annotation states: "Right and wrong each cling to their own; self and other hold different sentiments. Comparing another’s finger to one’s own, one takes one’s own finger as right and the other’s as wrong. Now, if one wishes to still the debate of right and wrong and instead takes the other’s finger as primary, comparing it to one’s own, then the other’s finger becomes right and one’s own becomes wrong. The analogy of horse to horse follows the same principle. Through repeated mutual comparison, self and other alike assert their own rightness while awaiting the other’s wrongness. Yet when right and wrong converge in the Dao, then though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are many, taking them near at hand from the body, they are but one finger; taking them afar from things, they are but one horse.

That which admits neither affirmation nor denial, neither rightness nor wrongness—this is the supreme principle of the world. The Dao that can be spoken is realized through practice; the thing that can be named is affirmed through designation. To take what one deems right as right and what one deems wrong as wrong is to remain bound by attachment. Better to let things follow their natural course and be as they may. When vertical and horizontal, beauty and ugliness are once more united as one, then the Dao is nowhere unfulfilled, and things are nowhere untrue.

Their division is their completion—this speaks of the Dao dispersing into things. Their completion is their destruction—this speaks of things having a beginning and an end. The Dao itself knows no completion or destruction. Completion and destruction are but the solitary perceptions of things. Splitting wood to make a vessel, the vessel is completed as the wood is destroyed—this is simply the work of creation and transformation. The enlightened one discards solitary perception and merges with the supreme principle. Acting without acting and lodging in the commonplace, one entrusts it to constant use, and thus there is nowhere it does not penetrate, nowhere one does not attain self-mastery—this is to approach the Dao.

The Dao is fundamentally without penetration or attainment; it is things that are without penetration or attainment, and thus the names of penetration and attainment arise. By virtue of this, one returns to the nameless. Having done so without knowing why, one may reluctantly call it the Dao.

The spirit and clarity within the self should be allowed to follow their natural course. Now, to labor the spirit in pursuit of unity is to stray far indeed—how is this different from the monkey keeper’s allocation of acorns, morning three and evening four, where name and reality remain unchanged yet joy and anger serve as their function? Those in the world who do not comprehend the supreme principle are like the many monkeys, swayed by joy and anger. Thus, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong yet rests in spontaneity, allowing both to proceed while returning to a single unity.

Chen Xiangdao’s annotation states: "Taking the body near at hand to illuminate heaven and earth, then heaven and earth are one finger; taking things afar to illuminate the myriad things, then the myriad things are one horse." Though heaven and earth are vast, they do not depart from having form; though the myriad things are numerous, they do not depart from having function. Not departing from form, then even in emptiness they are but one finger; not departing from function, then even in the world they are but one horse. As for the Dao, however—it is without form yet forms are completed through it; without function yet functions are perfected through it. It is nowhere and yet everywhere, non-acting and yet nothing is left undone—how could it be spoken of as one finger or one horse?

Chen Bixu’s annotation states: "The finger here refers to the pointing out of right and wrong. The common sentiment of people is to take this as right and point to that as wrong. That, not knowing it is wrong, then points to this as not yet right. Thus, one clings to this finger as right and calls that finger wrong. If there were no mutual pointing in the world, then things would be things of themselves, not forced by people; fingers would be fingers of themselves, not arrogantly asserting this deluded pointing. When things are not forced by people, one forgets things; when fingers do not arrogantly assert this deluded pointing, they are no longer fingers. Moreover, the finger that does not point to things has no this or that, no right or wrong. The finger that points to things forcibly generates this and that, right and wrong—this is not a true finger.

A horse inherently has form and color. To pick out color and name it is merely to speak of 'horse.' Speaking of 'horse,' then the horses of the world are one horse—white and black are not included. Now, if one seeks color to name a horse, it is called a 'white horse.' Seeking a white horse, then yellow and black horses are excluded. This is to lose its form by seeking color. Losing form by seeking color, then a white horse is not a horse. If, moreover, the fashion of the time favors white, then white is taken as right and 'horse' as wrong—this is to take wrong as right and right as wrong.

Those who harbor the heart of right and wrong yet cannot equalize them point to things with this and that, but forgetting this and that, then even the vastness of heaven and earth is but one finger. Those who distinguish the multiplicity of kinds yet cannot unify them take form and color with inclusion and exclusion, but shedding inclusion and exclusion, then even the profusion of the myriad things is but one horse. Viewed from what is the same, the permissible is permissible; viewed from what is different, the impermissible is impermissible. If the Dao is not practiced, it fails; when it fails, who would call it so?

In general, following principle, what is so is so, and nothing is not so; opposing principle, what is not so is not so, and nothing is so. If one fully accords with principle, then there is nothing that is not so, nothing that is not permissible, and one naturally merges in darkness. Though things assume ten thousand forms and their kinds differ, only the Dao unites and makes them one. It is like a craftsman making vessels: in calculating their completion, who considers the destruction of the raw material? Discussing completion, there is no destruction; discussing destruction, there is no completion. In relation to the Dao, they once more unite as one.

Thus, the enlightened one, recognizing that the uncarved block of the Dao is not used by the world, lodges it in self-utility—this is to use by means of non-use. Knowing the use of non-use, one attains self-mastery, and what is attained is fully realized. Yet traces remain. One who deeply understands the Dao merges with it in mind and body alone. Having done so without knowing why, there is no path of 'this' to follow.

If one labors the spirit to make things one, it is like the monkey keeper’s manipulation of knowledge to ensnare the many monkeys, or the monkeys’ use of joy and anger—it is likewise by virtue of this. Wang Xiu’s annotation states: "Raising the finger and horse to illustrate the non-finger and non-horse, one already has finger and horse in this."

Thus, attainment lies only in the state before things ever arose. Heaven and earth differ in form; the myriad things differ in function. Because they have form, though vast, they are equal in being existent; because they have function, though numerous, they are equal in being finite. As for that which lacks nothing and pervades all—how could it be spoken of as a single finger or a single horse?

The transformations of the myriad things inherently possess what is permissible and impermissible, what is so and what is not so. One should simply merge with the ultimate principle, unburdening the heart. The Dao accomplishes all without exception; nothing fails to conform to it. Thus, what is permissible and impermissible, what is so and what is not so, all belong to the ultimate principle. Aligned with the ultimate principle, the myriad things—whether vertical or horizontal, beautiful or ugly—are all reduced to one. The Dao disperses and becomes things, yet in the end, there is a beginning.

Creation and destruction are the deluded perceptions of things. When one merges with the principle, there is neither creation nor destruction—the Dao unites all as one. Nevertheless, this does not negate the creation and destruction of the myriad things; it merely lodges them in constant function without claiming them as its own. Thus, there is nowhere it does not penetrate; penetration is attainment, and attainment is nearness.

If one labors the spirit and illumination to force unity, how can one know their sameness? Hence, the analogy of the monkey keeper follows: though the tubers offered morning and evening differ, their quantity neither increases nor decreases. Though circumstances change, the heart remains without gain or loss. Those who submit to worldly sentiments without examining the ultimate principle differ not from the common monkeys. The sage harmonizes the presence and absence of right and wrong, allowing both to proceed.

Zhao Xuqi’s annotation states: Knowing that beyond the finger there is something that moves it, one knows the finger is not the finger. Knowing that beyond the horse there is something that drives it, one knows the horse is not the horse. Finger and horse are things with form; the non-finger and non-horse are formless. To illustrate the formless nature of form using form is not as effective as using the formless to illustrate the formless nature of form. Thus, one knows that the movements of heaven and earth and the arising of the myriad things all have something that governs them—this may be sought beyond heaven and earth and the myriad things.

What is permissible and impermissible, what is so and what is not so, the vertical and horizontal, the beautiful and ugly, the vast and minute, the strange and monstrous, right and wrong, creation and destruction—all unite as one. Then there is no right or wrong, and even when there is right, it is not employed. *Yong* means constancy; constancy is the use of non-use, which is the means to penetration. Penetration is attainment; attainment is nearness to the Dao.

If one relies on this to cease, then not only does the "not so" come to rest, but the "so" also comes to rest. When both right and wrong cease, yet one remains unaware of why, this is not true knowledge—it is to depart from form and abandon knowledge, claiming it as "sitting in forgetfulness." How is this not labor?

Spirit is illumination; illumination is spirit. "Three in the morning, four in the evening" is no different from "four in the morning, three in the evening." One is deluded by right and wrong, before and after, unaware of their sameness. The monkey keeper follows the monkeys’ joy and complies with it—this, too, is by virtue of this.

Yongzhai.

Here follows the translation:

---

It is said: "Finger" means the finger of the hand. If I take my finger to be the true finger, then I take another’s finger to be not the true finger. Yet that person who deems my finger not the true finger takes my finger to be not the true finger. Self and other stand opposed, and right and wrong cannot be fixed.

The "horse" refers to the counting rods in the game of *bosai*; in the *Record of Rites*, under the "Touhu" chapter, the tally of "horses" may be many or few, and so too with the right and wrong of the players. Because there is self and other, there is right and wrong. But if Heaven’s office is to cover and Earth’s office is to bear, how can they be divided into self and other?

This speaks of the necessity to equalize the judgments of things. What is acceptable is accepted; what is unacceptable is not accepted. The Dao moves and is completed—all is spontaneous. Things are called so because they are so, and what underlies their being so is no different from what underlies their not being so. In the distinctions among things, there is originally what is so and what is acceptable. Since nothing is not so and nothing is unacceptable, the horizontal and the vertical each fits its place, the beautiful and the ugly each fulfills its nature. All are penetrated and unified, returning to the Creator.

All things are not destroyed without being completed, and are not completed without being segmented. For example, trees are felled to build a house; the house is completed and the trees are destroyed. Knowing this principle, one lets go of what is "so" and does not employ it, lodging it instead in the constant. Taking constancy as one’s use, one follows the use and all is penetrated; penetration is attainment, and attainment is exhaustiveness.

People labor their spirit and understanding, creating one-sided theories, unaware that the principle is fundamentally the same. This is called "three in the morning"—these two characters are used to set forth the analogy, following the same method as in the "Fangsheng" passage. Name and reality do not change, yet joy and anger follow them. This illustrates that though the names of right and wrong differ, the principle in reality is the same. If one can follow what is so, then the world will naturally have no contention, and right and wrong will proceed in their two courses.

Master Chu’s limited insight says: Self and other differ in feeling, right and wrong point to each other. The west of the eastern house is the east of the western house; what precedes Heaven and Earth is what follows the Supreme Ultimate. This has been unequal from ancient times to the present, yet the True Person raises the analogies of the "not-finger" and the "not-horse"—this may be called skillfully equalizing the *Discourse on Equalizing Things*.

Taking the finger to illustrate that the finger is not the true finger is the view of ordinary people. Taking the not-finger to illustrate that the finger is not the true finger is the view of the Perfected Person. The meaning of the "not-horse" is the same. In the world, the views of the Perfected are few, and the views of the ordinary are many. Thus, the theories that "Heaven and Earth are one finger" and "the myriad things are one horse" only deepen the confusion.

Let us resolve this by saying: What differs is the feelings of the world; what is the same is the principle of the world. One principle can penetrate ten thousand feelings, so the not-finger is also the true finger. Ten thousand feelings cannot return to one principle, so the true horse is also not the true horse.

The finger and the horse involve form and description, and thus cannot escape right and wrong. The not-finger and the not-horse transcend form, number, words, and discussion. Therefore, though Heaven and Earth are vast, they can be illuminated by one finger, for it is born together with me. Though the myriad things are many, they can be likened to one horse, for they are one with me.

If one grasps their feelings and penetrates their principle, then though things differ in ten thousand ways, they are fused within me. Though affairs are separated by a thousand miles, they are connected in the heart. The ancients who unified the feelings of the multitude and possessed the Great Thing attained this.

The Most High said: "Attain the One, and the ten thousand affairs are complete." This is the equalizing of things, the end of discourse—is it not the ultimate discussion?

The ancients—their knowledge reached a point. To what point? Some took it to be as if things had never begun to exist. This is the utmost, the exhaustion—nothing can be added to it! Next were those who took it that things exist, yet had never begun to have boundaries. Next were those who took it that boundaries exist, yet had never begun to have right and wrong.

The manifestation of right and wrong is the injury to the Dao; the injury to the Dao is the completion of partiality. Is there truly completion and injury? Is there truly no completion and injury?

---

The presence of completion and injury—thus did Master Zhao play the zither; the absence of completion and injury—thus did Master Zhao not play the zither. When Master Zhao played the zither, when Shi Kuang wielded his baton, when Master Hui leaned upon the catalpa tree—these three masters’ knowledge approached the subtleties! All were at their peak, and so their deeds were recorded in their later years. Only because they cherished their arts did they differ from others; cherishing them, they sought to illuminate others thereby. Yet what they illuminated was not what could be illuminated—thus they ended in the obscurity of "hard and white." And Master Zhao’s son, in turn, ended with the threads of his father’s art, achieving nothing his whole life. Could this be called completion? Even I, too, would be complete. Could this not be called completion? Then things and I would have no completion.

Thus, the dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage contemplates. To refrain from using it yet lodge it in the common—this is called "illuminating through non-illumination."

Guo Xiang’s commentary: One who knows that things have never begun to exist looks outward without scrutinizing the cosmos, inward without perceiving his own body—thus he is vast and unburdened, responding to all without obstruction. Next are those who acknowledge things yet without boundaries; though they have not entirely forgotten, they can still forget self and other. Next are those who acknowledge boundaries yet without right and wrong; though they have not forgotten self and other, they can still forget the right and wrong of self and other. Without right and wrong, the Dao is whole. When the Dao is injured, emotions become partial and attachment takes form. Is there truly presence or absence of completion and injury?

Sounds cannot all be enumerated. Thus, though blowing pipes and plucking strings may involve many fingers, many sounds are lost. Those who grasp the flute or strum the zither seek to manifest sound, yet in manifesting sound, sound is lost; in not manifesting sound, sound is whole. Thus, to seek completion and incur injury—this was Master Zhao’s zither-playing; to achieve no completion yet incur no injury—this was Master Zhao’s not playing the zither. These three masters all sought to distinguish, yet illuminated what could not be illuminated—thus their knowledge exhausted their forms, their batons strained their waking hours, their leaning upon the catalpa brought only darkness. Relying on their peak abilities, they endured long; otherwise, they would have faltered early. The three masters took themselves as distinct from the multitude, desiring others to share their cherished arts—yet others ultimately did not understand. Thus, their arts and doctrines ended in obscurity. Master Zhao’s son, too, ended with the threads of his father’s art, achieving nothing in the end. If these three could be called complete, then my own incompletion would also be completion. If this cannot be called completion, then things and I have no completion.

The sage darkens his own abilities, shaping all things without omission. Now, these three masters sought to illuminate others with their cherished arts—was this not delusion? The sage is one without self. The dazzling confusion of doubt is contemplated and bounded. The vast, the strange, the deceptive, the uncanny—these are penetrated and unified. Let the myriad differences each rest in what they rest in, and the multitude not lose what they deem right—then the sage refrains from using, yet the uses of the ten thousand things are fully employed. The transformations of unbridled freedom, the peculiarities of the stubbornly strange, the bending to follow the lacking—though their uses are myriad, they are clearly self-evident.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: The Dao is nowhere absent, thus nothing is not the Dao; nothing is not the Dao, thus there is nothing beyond the Dao. This is how the ancients could regard things as never having begun to exist—able to merge with things as the Dao. To know and halt here is to reach the utmost. Next are those who acknowledge things yet without boundaries; though they cannot merge with things as the Dao, they can still unite things through the Dao. Next are those who acknowledge boundaries yet without right and wrong; though they cannot unite things through the Dao, they can still relinquish things to accord with the Dao. Though the knowledge of these two does not fully align with the Dao, it is not yet injured. When right and wrong become manifest, the Dao is thereby injured; when the Dao is injured, emotions arise, and attachment takes form. Yet from the perspective of the enlightened, things have never begun to exist—is there truly presence or absence of completion and injury? Master Zhao’s zither-playing, Shi Kuang’s wielding of the baton, Master Hui’s leaning upon the catalpa—these nearly grasped the meaning of completion and injury. If this can be called completion, then those without completion are also complete; if this cannot be called completion, then things and I ultimately have no completion. Why labor the mind over questions of presence or absence, completion or injury, seeking to achieve completion? When the radiance of subtlety is not yet exhausted, confounding our hearts with doubts of presence and absence, we still contemplate and dispel it, returning to clarity before halting. How much less can there be things? Thus, to refrain from using yet entrust it to the self-accomplishment of the ten thousand things—this is called "illuminating through non-illumination."

Lin Yidu’s commentary: Life and death are the greatest of things—if one can be without life and death, then other things need not be negated to be negated. Thus, to regard things as never having begun to exist is the utmost. Next are those who acknowledge things yet without boundaries; though they have not forgotten that life and death constitute "things," they have not yet reached the boundaries of self and other. Next are those who acknowledge boundaries yet without right and wrong; though they have left worldly learning to follow the Dao and already have boundaries, they can still know the differing emotions of self and other, allowing each to be right or wrong without imposing right or wrong. The body of the Dao is undifferentiated, originally without self and other. Once right and wrong are established, each clings to one corner—this is how the Dao is injured and attachment takes form. With attachment comes aversion, and self and other are fully present. The noble person discusses the Dao to remedy injury, yet when words manifest distinctions, they further create divisions. Thus, Zhuangzi does not fix the presence or absence of completion and injury—grasping the meaning, he forgets words, and therein lies the point. The sages of old, at the height of brilliance, were still and unmoving—this was Master Zhao’s not playing the zither. When the Dao is the mean, it responds and thoroughly penetrates—this was Master Zhao’s playing the zither, Shi Kuang’s wielding of the baton, Master Hui’s leaning upon the catalpa. The knowledge of these three masters approached the Dao but did not reach it; yet their arts were at their peak, and so their deeds were recorded in their later years, meaning they never awakened their whole lives.

To not fully realize one’s nature is to be confused; to not exhaustively investigate principle is to be doubtful. Radiance is the scattering of light.

What the sage seeks does not lie in enlightenment but in delusion, thus entrusting it to the common uses of ordinary people while remaining unobscured. Chen Xiangdao’s annotation: "The Supreme Simplicity (Taiyi) is before qi is seen, yet those who embody it take it as the state before things ever existed—this is the utmost, the complete! The Supreme Beginning (Taichu) is the inception of qi, yet those who embody it regard life as loss and death as return. The Supreme Commencement (Taishi) is the inception of form, yet those who embody it take nonbeing as the origin, life as the substance, and death as the corpse, thereby further entangling themselves in the notions of life and death as loss and return."

When one transgresses against things yet does not depart from the Dao, there has never been any boundary. Boundaries belong to virtue. Those who take nonbeing, life, and death as origin, substance, and corpse are already confined by boundaries and have not yet engaged with affairs. Thus, there has never been right and wrong; the Dao has never been diminished, yet it is diminished by the manifestation of right and wrong. Love has never been complete, yet it is completed by the Dao’s diminution.

The Dao is uncarved wood. Right and wrong are vessels. When vessels are completed, the uncarved wood is destroyed. The Dao is rivers and lakes. Love is the moisture of dew. When rivers and lakes are lost, the moisture of dew follows—this is why completion and diminution perpetually follow one another. Thus, Zhuangzi does not definitively speak of their presence or absence but leaves it to people to seek with their own understanding.

Joy that does not rely on things is the joy of Heaven. Joy that depends on things is the joy of man. The joys of Master Zhao, Shi Kuang, and Master Hui all inevitably rely on things; their preferences merely differ from those of the multitude. What one’s body desires to clarify ultimately ends in seeming right but being wrong.

Things are never without completion, nor are they ever with completion. Viewing the arts of these three masters through common eyes, there is nothing that is not complete—this is why radiance scatters without light, and the world is thereby confused and doubtful.

Chen Bixu’s annotation: "Before things ever existed, one roams at the inception of things—this refers to those who recline in stillness. Next, there are things but no boundaries—this is the state of being alone, having lost one’s counterpart. Next, there are boundaries but no right and wrong—this is the state of ‘I have lost myself; do you understand?’ When right and wrong are manifest, the Dao is diminished; the Dao’s diminution is what completes love. Is there truly presence or absence of completion and diminution?"

The arts of Master Zhao, Shi Kuang, and Master Hui are their innate strengths, yet if one seeks to make those of lesser nature understand them, knowledge is exhausted and essence depleted, and both cannot be attained. The great meaning lies in self-clarity and self-governance alone. If one uses clarity to instruct others, these are but ordinary skills—how can they be called completion?

The sage regards extraordinarily refined and exceptional matters as disturbances beyond the common, thus setting boundaries and dwelling within the proper scope of things, entrusting them to personal use. In this way, the arts of the three masters each have their own clarity.

Zhao Xuqi’s annotation: *Liezi* states, "That which gives birth to things cannot be called nonexistent; the Limitless (Wuji) becomes the Supreme Ultimate (Taiji)." With the Supreme Ultimate, there is yin and yang—this is called having boundaries. When yin and yang divide, hardness and softness take form, and good and evil arise. Before joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are expressed, there has never been anything—this is called the center, yet there has never been nothing. Joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are boundaries. Whether they are moderated or not is the manifestation of right and wrong. Once the center is expressed, nature moves and becomes emotion. Love is the root of emotion. With movement and stillness, there is completion and diminution.

Master Zhao’s zither playing is not understood except by Shi Kuang. Master Hui’s eloquence is not grasped except by Zhuangzi. Though the three masters each attained the subtleties, they did not know the zither playing without playing, the listening without hearing, or the eloquence without eloquence—thus, Zhuangzi came after them.

Zhuangzi said of what set him apart from Master Hui: "What I clarify differs from him. He clarifies what is insufficient to be clarified, and though he exhausts the debates of hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference, he ultimately remains in obscurity and lack of clarity. As for Master Zhao’s son, he does not understand the mystery of the stringless zither and ultimately achieves nothing. To call this completion is also to call it incompletion—neither can be truly ascribed to it. Thus, clarity emerges from confusion and doubt. This is what the sage esteems."

*The Oral Teachings of Yongzhai* states: "Though this passage speaks from the inception of heaven and earth, one who grasps this principle finds it present before one’s eyes. For instance, before a thought arises, there has never been anything; once this thought arises, there are things. Through this thought, things and self emerge—this is having boundaries. From things and self arise likes, dislikes, joy, and anger—this is having right and wrong. Without reflecting back to the time before a thought arose, one only sees the turmoil in one’s breast—this is the Dao’s diminution and love’s completion. Yet when this thought passes, all is as it was—thus, one sees that there has never been completion or diminution. If one can realize this, it is all of immediate personal use.

First, the principle of completion and diminution is explained, then illustrated with the analogy of zither playing, followed by Shi Kuang and Master Hui. The arts of these three masters all gained great renown in the world, enduring throughout their lives. Their preferences, though they deemed them distinct from the world, led them to boast and explain, yet their listeners could not understand. Thus, they achieved nothing in their lifetimes.

The debate over hardness and whiteness was Gongsun Long’s affair, yet Zhuangzi attributed it to Master Hui, merely borrowing the name of his distinctions. Confusion that breeds doubt is seeming clarity that is not clarity—this means the sage’s mind never clings to traces, and what is seen is as if present, as if absent.

The character *tu* (图) is glossed as ‘desire.’ What the sage desires is precisely this: to set aside what is not used and lodge it in the ordinary—this is called ‘clarity.’"

The ancients prized true knowledge and cast aside delusive knowing, relinquished stagnant being to preserve wondrous being—thus safeguarding the authenticity of life and preserving the Dao of spontaneity. As the human heart grew shallow and the world’s ways declined, things arose to obstruct its emptiness and clarity, boundaries formed to limit its domain. Self and other stood opposed, and right and wrong became manifest; with right and wrong manifest, the Dao suffered loss and partiality took shape.

Yet how could there truly be completion or loss? Once more, this is raised as a warning to awaken the human heart, that it may grasp the fundamental purport of *equalizing things*. Completion and loss belong to the coarse paths of things—if one can truly return to a state beyond things, where would completion or loss arise?

Zhaowen’s mastery of the zither was most refined, yet because he never transcended form, sound, measure, and number, he could not escape completion and loss. *Zhi ce* refers to striking time with a staff. *Ju wu* means reclining against a table while discoursing. These were the strengths of Master Kuang and Master Hui, each taking pride in their own abilities, cherishing them to old age without waning. Not only did they cherish them themselves, but they also sought to enlighten others—yet without considering what suited those others, they merely clamored to impose agreement, ending in confusion, never awakening, never realizing.

And Zhaowen’s son, in turn, inherited the thread, yet throughout his life achieved nothing. The first three masters completed their arts but lost the Dao, yet each believed themselves complete. Zhaowen’s son lost both in art and in the Dao, yet still considered himself correct. This shows how each took their own rightness as partial, and how completion and loss have no fixed standard.

The dazzling confusion of doubt refers to how the arts of these three masters muddled the world and bewildered the eyes and ears. Thus, what the sage desires is precisely this: to set aside what cannot be used and lodge it in the ordinary Dao, gradually restoring the original state—this is called *using one’s light well without dazzling*.

Now, let me say this: is it of the same kind as these examples? Or is it not of the same kind?

To be of the same kind or not of the same kind—if we take them as the same kind, then there is no difference from those examples. Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it:

There is a beginning; there is that which precedes the beginning; there is that which precedes even the preceding of the beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is that which precedes non-being; there is that which precedes even the preceding of non-being. Suddenly there is being and non-being, yet we do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly being or non-being.

Now I have already spoken, yet I do not know whether what I have called it is truly speaking or truly not speaking. Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; nothing is longer-lived than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived. Heaven and earth are born together with me; the myriad things and I are one.

Since we have already become one, can there still be speech? Since we have already called it one, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. From this point onward, even the most skillful reckoner cannot reach it—how much less can ordinary people? Thus, from non-being to being, we reach three—how much more so from being to being? Do not proceed further; rest here.

Guo Xiang’s commentary:
Now, to say there is no right or wrong—do we not know whether this is of the same kind as those who speak of being, or not of the same kind? If we call it the same kind, then I take non-being as right, while they take non-being as wrong—this is not the same kind. Though right and wrong differ, they are still not free from having right and wrong, and thus are of the same kind as those. Therefore, whether of the same kind or not, they are all of the same kind, no different from those.

To be truly not of the same kind, nothing is better than having no mind. First, cast aside what is wrong; then cast aside the casting aside. Cast aside again and again—right and wrong are gone. Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it:

There is a beginning—this implies an end. There is that which precedes the beginning—here there is no end or beginning, and life and death are one. There is that which precedes even the preceding of the beginning—here, to speak of oneness is not as good as not being one and yet being naturally equal; this is to forget even oneness.

There is being—where there is being, beauty and ugliness, right and wrong all arise. There is non-being—where there is non-being, we do not yet know that there is no non-being, and right and wrong, likes and dislikes still linger in the heart. There is that which precedes non-being—here, we know there is no non-being, yet we still cannot be without knowledge. There is that which precedes even the preceding of non-being—suddenly there is being and non-being, yet we do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly being or non-being. Here, all knowledge is forgotten, and suddenly we realize there is nothing at all.

When there is nothing at all, then heaven and earth, the myriad things, self and other, right and wrong—all become clear and certain. And yet we do not know whether what I have called it is truly speaking or truly not speaking—all is swept away, leaving not even the slightest dust in the heart.

If we take forms as relative, then Mount Tai is greater than the tip of an autumn hair. But if each thing abides in its own nature and reaches its limit, then a large form is not in excess, nor is a small form insufficient. When a thing is sufficient in its nature, then the tip of an autumn hair is not merely small in its smallness, nor is Mount Tai merely large in its largeness. If we take sufficiency in nature as greatness, then nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair. If sufficiency in nature is not greatness, then even Mount Tai can be called small. If Mount Tai is small, then nothing in the world is large. If the tip of an autumn hair is large, then nothing in the world is small.

When things are sufficient in their natural state and at peace in their allotted nature, then even heaven and earth are not long-lived enough to be born together with me, and the myriad things are not different enough to be one with me. The myriad things and myriad forms, when self-sufficient, are one. Once they are one, there is no principle that requires speech. Some things cannot clarify their oneness on their own, so we call them one to correct them. But once we call them one, this is already speech. One and speech make two; one is originally one, but speech makes it two—can we not call this three? To speak of one with speech still makes three. With so many things and so many names, how can they all be accounted for?

Thus, those who speak of oneness are no different from those others; but those who forget oneness have no speech and yet are naturally one.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary:
People cannot cast aside self and other, forget right and wrong, and reach the state before there was anything because they do not know where the mind of self and other, right and wrong begins. To grasp this principle, one must observe it from the beginning, hence the saying: "There is a beginning." The beginning is originally nothing; once there is this beginning, then there is an origin. It also says, "There is that which precedes the beginning"—this is to cast aside its origin. But if what is cast aside does not depart, then one is still not free from having an origin.

It also says, "There is that which precedes even the preceding of the beginning"—this is to cast aside the casting aside. When there is no origin and no casting aside, then the source from which my mind arises becomes clear. One knows that all that exists now emerges from nothing. Only by knowing this can life and death be in my hands; I can prevent what I do not desire from arising. Thus it says, "There is non-being"—yet to have this non-being is still not free from being. "There is that which precedes non-being"—this is to cast aside non-being. "There is that which precedes even the preceding of non-being"—this is to cast aside the casting aside.

If we seek the origin and cannot find it, and seek non-being and also cannot find it, then enlightenment comes in an instant, and all things naturally align. Thus it says, "Suddenly there is being and non-being, yet we do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly being or non-being," guiding scholars to forget words and grasp it with the heart.

Nevertheless, what I have spoken of now is also that which precedes anything—how could I know whether it is speaking or not speaking? This also lets scholars know that speech has never truly been speech. Only by knowing where my mind arises can we see that the tip of an autumn hair, Mount Tai, the child who dies young, Pengzu, and even heaven and earth, the myriad things—all arise from this. Then small and large, long and short—how can they have a fixed form?

Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth; if one knows this, then I too begin from the nameless. With the self, there is heaven and earth—thus heaven and earth are born together with me. Named, it is the mother of the myriad things; if one knows this, then I too am born from the named. Without the self, there are no myriad things—thus the myriad things and I are one.

Lin Yi’s solitary note: Only without speech can the solitary be seen; only by seeing the solitary can one transcend classification. Now, though I speak, it is to dispel being, yet speech itself becomes being. Seeking to dispel being and return to non-being to escape classification, the act of dispelling itself becomes a form of classification. Thus, classification and non-classification are both classifications, differing not at all from that.

Yet without speech, there is no way to awaken the deluded world, so I venture to speak of it. That which has a beginning is visible in form, seeing things but not the Dao. That which has never had a beginning sees the Dao yet does not forget it. That which has never had what never had a beginning—here, qi, form, and substance are complete yet undivided, called "primordial chaos," the ultimate of the Dao.

That which has being is not wondrous being. That which has non-being is not true non-being. How can we know whether being or non-being is truly being or non-being? "One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao." "Unfathomable yin and yang—this is called the spirit." Yet unable to forget speech, we are compelled to speak—is this truly speaking? Truly not speaking?

What the world calls small and large refers to form; what I call small and large refers to the Dao. What the world calls long life and early death refers to existence; what I call long life and early death refers to non-existence. The tip of an autumn hair, near to formlessness, compared to Mount Tai, is surely large. Yet measured against the absence of gain or loss, Mount Tai is small. A child who dies young, near to non-existence, compared to Pengzu, is surely long-lived. Yet measured against the absence of life and death, Pengzu is short-lived.

Near to non-existence, one can be born together with heaven and earth; near to formlessness, one can be one with the myriad things.

Chen Xiangdao’s note: The Dao in the world has no end, no beginning, neither being nor non-being. Yet when it scatters and lodges in things, then end and beginning follow one another, being and non-being give rise to each other. Thus, from the perspective of the manifest, that which has a beginning is that which has being. From the perspective of the wondrous, the ultimate lies in that which has never had what never had a beginning, never had what never had non-being—this is the highest.

*Laozi* says: "Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth." Non-being is the essence; beginning is the function. Now, to first speak of having a beginning and then of being and non-being is to use function to trace back to essence. As for the Dao as a thing: non-being is not emptiness, being is not solidity. It is nowhere yet everywhere, does nothing yet accomplishes all. Thus, the ancients who spoke of the Dao often dwelled in ambiguity, not clinging to being or non-being, to dispel the burden of speech.

Chen Bixu’s note: "Has a beginning" refers to the Dao generating the One. "Never had a beginning" is the primordial chaos of Great Non-being. "Never had what never had a beginning" is beyond sight and hearing, the emptiness of emptiness. These three describe the Dao before qi arose. "Has being" refers to things taking form and transforming alone, existing in isolation. "Has non-being" refers to things before their forms appear, in tranquil stillness. "Never had non-being" refers to before the signs of form, silent and vast, the utmost non-being. "Never had what never had non-being" refers to the profound stillness and vastness, untouchable, the non-being of non-being. These four describe the Dao before form arose.

"Suddenly there is being and non-being"—the Dao is everywhere, generating and transforming without cease. The myriad things stand alone yet doubt their solitude, flitting back and forth. Heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—how can there be being or non-being? Speaking or not speaking, one cannot escape description. To transcend both, is it not to forget speech?

Zhao Xuzhai’s note: "Has a beginning" and "has being" are both being. Ascending further to "no beginning" and "no being," though one takes them as non-being, the self still remains—so they cannot be called non-being. Then how can we know being and non-being? Heaven and earth are born together with me—there is no long life or early death. The myriad things and I are one—there is no large or small. Yet to speak of "one" is already to involve speech. With speech, there are distinctions. From non-being to being, the transitions are endless. Only with no destination can what is called "thus" also be nothing. How much more so what is not?

*The Oral Teachings of Yongzhai* says: "Has a beginning," "never had a beginning," and "never had what never had a beginning" correspond to *Liezi*’s "Great Simplicity," "Great Plainness," and "Great Beginning." If Mount Tai is called large, heaven and earth are larger still—thus Mount Tai may also be called small. Pengzu is the longest-lived, yet compared to heaven and earth, he is short-lived! Heaven and earth are born together with me in the Great Void; the myriad things are born together with me within heaven and earth. Even grasses, trees, and insects blend indistinguishably with me.

In the world, nothing is said to be larger than Mount Tai, nothing longer-lived than Pengzu. This is to judge by form, which knows no limit. Yet viewed from the emptiness of inherent nature, Mount Tai is but a tiny thing, Pengzu but an infant. Though the tip of an autumn hair is fine, at the inception of form it shares this principle—how can the supremely large not reside within it? Though a child who dies young is short-lived, at the inception of life it shares this nature—how can the longest-lived not reside within it? Heaven and earth are but the greatness of form; the myriad things are but the multitude of form. Tracing them to their origin, how are they not one?

Thus, through repeated and reciprocal discourse, one shatters the attachments of worldly views and unlocks the ultimate mechanism of the principles of things. Proceeding from this, the meanings of the millet-grain holding Mount Li and the mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru may be understood by analogy.

If the scholar can truly grasp the emptiness at the center of the ring, resting in the natural division of the celestial balance, then the teachings that enlarge the tip of an autumn hair and diminish Mount Tai, that grant longevity to a child who dies young and shorten the lifespan of Pengzu—these are not merely corrections of common folly or remedies for the errors of sentient beings, but the ultimate realization of principle, which is indeed so.

Yet how is it that worldly eyes see only the ceaseless, uneven flux of the myriad things, while the realm of clarity within the square inch of the heart is swept away with them, like water rushing into a ravine, with no hope of returning to the source? Therefore, the perfected person earnestly instructs, guiding one to turn back and investigate the original beginning, to merge self and other, to be of one body and one family, without hindrance to one’s benevolence, joyfully and harmoniously sharing in the enjoyment of purity and stillness—such was the age of Fuxi, the Yellow Emperor, and the present day. This is the esoteric transmission of the heart by the sages and worthies.

What need is there for debate over longevity and early death, self and other, great and small, past and present? All arise as one, and the great joy is akin to the earlier metaphors of the finger and the horse. Though the words may seem contrary to reason, the principle is in fact profoundly precise—this is what is meant by "straight words seeming reverse," and it is the Way for those who understand.

The Way has never had boundaries; words have never had constancy. Yet because of this, distinctions arise. Let me speak of these divisions: there is left and right, order and righteousness, division and debate, competition and contention—these are called the eight virtues.

Beyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss; within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not debate; regarding the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the intentions of the former kings, the sage debates but does not argue. Thus, division implies what is undivided; debate implies what is undebated. Why is this? The sage embraces it, while the multitude debates it to display to one another. Therefore, it is said that debate implies what is unseen.

The great Way is not named; great debate does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest; great courage is not aggressive. When the Way is made manifest, it is no longer the Way; when words are debated, they do not reach; when benevolence is constant, it does not succeed; when integrity is pure, it is not trusted; when courage is aggressive, it does not succeed. When these five are rounded, they nearly approach squareness. Thus, to know to stop at what one does not know—this is perfection! Who knows the debate of non-debate, the Way of non-Way? If one can know this, it is called the celestial treasury. It is filled yet never full, drawn from yet never exhausted, and one does not know whence it comes—this is called preserving the light.

In ancient times, Yao asked Shun, saying: "I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I face south, I am not at ease. What is the reason for this?" Shun said: "Those three lords dwell among the mugwort and reeds. Why are you not at ease? In ancient times, ten suns appeared together, and the myriad things were all illuminated—how much more so for one whose virtue surpasses the sun!"

Guo Xiang’s commentary: The Way has never had boundaries; it is obscurely present in all things. Words have never had constancy; right and wrong have no fixed standard. The Way is unbounded, so the myriad things freely occupy their allotted domains. Left and right differ in convenience; each thing has its principle. Grouped by kind and distinguished by category, they compete and contend in debate—summarized, these are the eight virtues. Beyond the six directions, referring to what lies outside the divisions of inherent nature, though principle exists there, it does not move the sage, so it is not discussed. Within the six directions, the sage sets forth their natures and settles them. The intentions of the former kings follow their completed traces, congealing in perfect appropriateness, so each thing divides itself, and each affair distinguishes itself. If one were to divide them by oneself, one would not see their self-distinction. The sage embraces non-debate, while the multitude debates what they know to display to others, hence there is what is unseen.

The great Way has no name; it is left to name itself. Great debate does not speak yet distinguishes itself. Great benevolence has no love yet preserves itself. Great integrity has no place to contain its modesty. Great courage goes nowhere without following others. When the Way is used to illuminate others, both self and other are lost; when words are used to divide others, they do not reach self-division. When things are constantly loved, they are not universally cared for. When integrity is forced, it is not pure. Aggressive courage is detested by the world. These five all injure what is appropriate by acting, unable to stop at their original nature, and endlessly seek outside themselves—like trying to square the circle or envying birds as a fish. Thus, what one does not know lies outside the divisions of inherent nature. Not seeking forced knowledge and stopping within what one does not know—this is perfection.

Non-speech and non-Way—this is called the celestial treasury, vast and all-embracing. The heart of the perfected person responds but does not store; principle exists without trace, allowing its natural clarity to shine without obstruction.

In the past, Yao wished to attack the three states and asked Shun. Shun said that what things find peaceful has no baseness, so the mugwort and reeds are the wondrous abode of the three lords. Why be ill at ease? When ten suns appeared together, nothing was not illuminated; when virtue surpasses the sun, there is nothing it does not shine upon. Now, to seize the wishes of the mugwort and reeds and attack to make them follow oneself—this is not the expansive Way, so one is not at ease in spirit and understanding. If things flow freely in their natures, each resting in what is peaceful, then there is nothing inappropriate in them, and nothing in oneself that is not joyful.

Lu Huiqing’s commentary: The Way is present everywhere without exception—it has never had boundaries. Words, wherever they exist, cannot be fixed—it has never had constancy. From their natural absence, distinctions arise, and thus there are boundaries. Only because there are boundaries do left and right arise, leading to competition and contention, showing that one cannot help but act with virtue, thus reaching this point. Therefore, some things are preserved but not discussed, some are discussed but not debated, and some are debated but not argued. Observing the words of the Six Classics, one may know the sage’s reasons for discussing or not discussing, debating or not debating, arguing or not arguing.

Where principle reaches its utmost, there is distinction without distinction, debate without debate. If one insists on distinguishing and debating every single thing, it will ultimately lead to competition and contention. The sage knows that principle cannot be debated—it is simply embraced. The multitude, however, debates to display themselves, yet remains blind to what truly matters.

Thus, the five—Dao, speech, benevolence, integrity, and courage—when rounded to dull their sharp edges, incline toward the Dao. The mind’s outward expression is sharpness; when rounded to its utmost sharpness, it does not give rise to the mind—how could knowledge find room there? This is the debate of non-debate, the Dao of non-Dao.

The Celestial Treasury holds myriad differences yet is supremely rich. Thus, it is never filled when poured into, never exhausted when drawn from, and its source remains unknown—this is brilliance that does not dazzle. Yao wished to replace Zong, Kuai, and Xu Ao but could not rest easy. The three still dwelled among the brambles and weeds, for they had not been felled. Yet even without felling them, Yao could not rest easy—this was not a response to things that does not conceal, but rather a case of things being probed before emerging. When virtue advances daily, can there be any unease? Such words address what wisdom’s light has yet to illuminate, hence this discussion persists. The deeds of Zong, Kuai, and Xu Ao remain unrecorded in history.

Lin Yi’s sole annotation: Where the Dao has divisions, things divide themselves; where it has no divisions, I have never divided or debated. In every matter debating itself, there is what is not debated—I have never debated. Things divide themselves, thus there is division without division; matters debate themselves, thus there is debate without debate. The sage conceals and does not speak; the multitude debates to display, hence they do not see. The Dao is present everywhere yet cannot be named. The debate of non-debate—this is true debate.

The myriad things each fulfill their nature and destiny—where would I impose my benevolence? Great integrity has no corners, so there is no place for resentment. Great courage is not harmful—it is spiritually martial yet does not kill. All things, when obstructed, develop edges and angles; when unimpeded, they have no fixed form. The five all suffer from obstruction: Dao obstructed by clarity, speech by debate, benevolence by convention, integrity by purity, and courage by harm. If one rounds and files their edges to merge with the great whole, one approaches the Dao’s square.

The Celestial Treasury is the natural storehouse to which all things return. Thus, it is never filled when poured into, never exhausted when drawn from. Compared to the essence of life’s nature, it neither increases nor diminishes. Seeking its source yields nothing—this is called preserving brilliance, its light hidden within, concealed yet unextended.

The sage’s mind is profoundly still, each resting in its proper place, without regard for distance or depth, entrusted to self-attainment. This is the self-concealment of the Celestial Treasury, the origin of preserved brilliance.

Chen Xiangdao’s annotation: The Dao has never had boundaries—like tenons and tiles, it is present everywhere. Speech has never had constancy—it exists yet is not discussed, debated yet not argued. When the Dao descends as virtue, emerging with distinctions, it takes form with left and right, principle with order and righteousness, speech with division and debate, and affairs with competition and contention—how can one expect things to be equal?

Dao made manifest yet not the Dao—such were Gongsun Qiu and his followers. Speech debating yet falling short—such were Gongsun Long and his followers. Benevolence bound by convention yet unfulfilled—such were Mo Di and his followers. Integrity fixated on purity yet untrustworthy—such were the followers of Zhongzi of Yu Ling. Courage bent on harm yet unfulfilled—such were the followers of Beigong You. These five, when their edges are sharpened, can be rounded to approach the Dao. Pushed further upward, they reach the unfathomable spirit—what is called true knowledge as non-knowledge.

Nowhere not concealed—this is the Celestial Treasury. Not endangering one’s authenticity—this is preserved brilliance. This is the nature that neither loses nor gains. The debate of non-debate encompasses all; the Dao of non-Dao penetrates all. This is the effect of the Dao in fully realizing one’s nature.

Those who magnify the Dao regard all with equal benevolence, valuing the near to embrace the distant. If one takes the distinction between self and others as the heart, right and wrong as debate, and seeks to attack others among the brambles and weeds, even facing south as a ruler will not bring ease. What is hoped for is small, what is lost is great—this is not what is called knowing preserved brilliance.

Chen Bixu’s annotation: Nothing enters where there is no gap—what barrier could obstruct boundaries? Utmost speech is never inappropriate—what constancy could fix it? Yet the speakable and expressible—how could they lack rules? Left and right, order and righteousness belong to boundaries; division, debate, competition, and contention belong to speech. These boundaries and speech have their actual principles, hence they are called virtue.

Beyond the six directions, the sage does not discuss—where principle exists, affairs are set aside. Within the six directions, the sage does not debate—where affairs are proper, words are forgotten. The rise and fall of dynasties, the sage discusses in detail with praise and blame, leaving warnings for posterity—not to boast of vast debate. Thus, what is divided within is not divided without; what is debated here is not debated there. The sage embraces it, the wise do not speak; the multitude debates, those who speak do not know.

The great Dao cannot be named—it is fitting for all things. When the five—debate, benevolence, integrity, and courage—are complete, there is non-action in the Dao, and principle naturally aligns. If even one matter is amiss, like fitting a circle into a square, it will inevitably clash with things. Thus, not overstepping one’s bounds to seek knowledge and injure natural nature—the debate of non-debate, the Dao of non-Dao—all are concealed within the human heart. Is this not the Celestial Treasury?

With form, pouring fills; with a source, drawing exhausts. Now, neither filling nor exhausting—this is knowing the source’s depth, the form’s vastness. Depth and vastness cannot be seen, hence it is called preserved brilliance.

The Three Lords still dwell amidst the mugwort and wormwood, like the wren content with a single branch. The "ten suns" are compared to Yao’s virtue, speaking of how nothing remains unilluminated. The *Daodejing* states: "A great state desires only to shelter and nurture its people; a small state desires only to serve others. When both attain what they desire, the greater should humble itself." Zhao Xuzhai’s commentary notes: "The Dao has never been bounded—it exists everywhere without exception. Words have never been fixed—nothing remains beyond their reach. Only when one seeks to clarify what is right do boundaries and divisions arise, leading to the eight contentions of left and right." Beyond the Six Directions lies the formless; within them, the formed. The formed arises from the formless, and the formless is its root. To preserve without discussion is to be wordless; to discuss without debate is to speak. When matters reach debate, disputes arise. The *Spring and Autumn Annals*, a work of the Sage’s brush, conveys right and wrong through praise and blame, yet even this arises from necessity, and the various commentaries may not fully grasp the Sage’s intent. Thus it is said: "There are things unseen."

Zhuangzi invokes this to clarify his own purpose in writing. "The great Dao cannot be named" to "great courage is not contentious"—these five are rounded and nearly square. "Rounded" here means to shave away the edges to form a circle; "nearly square" is to approach the Dao. When the Dao is made manifest and the five virtues are named, the Dao is fragmented. To know one’s limits in what one does not know is to be beyond naming—this is the Dao’s perfection. The "wordless word" is spoken by those who speak; the "Dao-less Dao" is followed by those who follow. If one can grasp this, one’s center is empty, hence the "Celestial Treasury," the source from which all things arise. As for "pouring without filling, drawing without exhausting," this is to be without limit, to not know whence it comes or whither it goes. "Preserved brilliance" means to conceal one’s light.

Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao do not appear in the classics or histories. The following chapter speaks of "proper place, proper flavor, proper color," referring to the mouth’s delight in taste, the eye’s in color, and the limbs’ in ease—all rooted in inherent nature. Yao sought to overcome and discard these, yet though he occupied the highest position, he took no joy in them. Shun told Yao that the Emperor possessed true insight: these three are at peace in their proper places—why discard them? Only the Sage can fulfill the form. Viewed thus, Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao seem to be allegories.

The *Yongzhai Oral Exegesis* states: "Boundaries" refer to self and other; "constancy" means having a fixed position. The perfect Dao and perfect words are originally without self or other, but the private biases of the human heart introduce the notion of "rightness," giving rise to many divisions. The eight virtues merely reflect the opposition of self and other. Once self and other are set against each other in discourse, each clings to its position, and debate never ends. Thus, beyond the Six Directions, we preserve without discussion. As the Buddhists say: "The four directions and above and below cannot be conceived." Within the Six Directions lie many principles—when has the Sage not spoken of them? Yet he does not exhaustively debate to impose knowledge on the world. What appears in the historical records are the intentions of former kings in governing the world—how could the Sage refrain from discussion? Yet when has he ever contended over right and wrong? In all matters under heaven, forgetting words is the highest; once debate begins, it is because the heart lacks insight. Thus there is "no division, no debate."

"The great Dao cannot be named" means it has no opposition. "Great debate does not speak"—this is the highest speech. "Great benevolence is not benevolent"—it leaves no trace of benevolence. The macaque hides its food, calling it "fullness." If one takes moderation for frugality, the mind becomes self-satisfied, and it cannot be called great frugality. The "unskilled" show no sign of using courage. "Rounded" means circular. The five virtues above are all round things, originally undifferentiated. If the slightest trace appears, they approach square things, developing edges and corners. True knowledge is knowing without knowledge—only then can one perceive the convergence of heavenly principle. Thus one cannot add to it or diminish it, and one does not know whence it comes. Concealing one’s light without revealing it is called "preserved brilliance." Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao are matters unseen in the records—are they not also allegories?

The "mugwort and wormwood" metaphorically represent the obstructions of worldly desires, meaning those Three Lords are self-obscured by desires and cannot turn toward transformation. If I harbor even the slightest displeasure, self and other are set in opposition. The sun illuminates all things without exception—how much more should virtue, surpassing the sun, be unable to tolerate these Three? The reason the Sage does not debate right and wrong is that he illuminates them by heaven. The "ten suns" are like the analogy of "nothing is brighter than clarity." Yao’s desire to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao seems disconnected from the preceding text, yet the opening phrase "in former times" links it as an evidentiary reference. This event does not appear in other classics, so there is no way to verify it. The names of the three states are also difficult to interpret, and the various commentaries remain silent. Only the *Pronunciation and Meaning* records Cui’s explanation: Zong is one, Kuai is two, Xu’ao is three. Chen Bixu’s *Pronunciation and Meaning* also cites Cui, with another version: Zongkuai, Congzhi, and Xujiao. The *Questions on the World* chapter also mentions Yao attacking Congzhi and Xujiao, yet the reader must discern the author’s intent rather than be constrained by the factual details.

My humble observation, appended to this compilation in hopes of engaging those with broader knowledge: The purport of the classic, following the earlier discussion of boundaries, constancy, and contention, suggests that the Three States serve as metaphors for the three conditions of "within and beyond the Six Directions," "the intentions of former kings," and "discussion, debate, and argument"—all of which one seeks to attack and discard. This is to transcend the right and wrong of words and debates, to restore the profound silence of the Dao and virtue. Yet even Yao could not overcome this on his own and asked Shun about it. Shun replied that the Three Lords still dwell amidst the mugwort and wormwood, meaning they already exist but are not discussed. It is better to let them reside in a realm without people, so that for me there is no concern, and for them there is no hindrance—what is there not to release?

Further evidence states: In ancient times, when ten suns appeared together, all yin forces retreated, and eyes and limbs awaited this accomplishment. How much more so now, when the Emperor’s virtue surpasses even the sun? Then those three conditions would depart of themselves without need for attack—such is the inherent principle.

This is to convey through parable that when debate, discussion, and argument do not arise, right and wrong naturally cease. This is the great purport of *Equalizing Things*.

**“Equalizing Things,” Third Chapter**

Nie Que asked Wang Ni, “Do you know what all things agree upon as right?”

Wang Ni replied, “How would I know?”

“Do you know what you do not know?”

“How would I know?”

“Then do things have no knowledge?”

“How would I know? Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it: How can I be certain that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How can I be certain that what I call not-knowing is not knowing? Now, let me ask you this: When people sleep in damp places, their waists ail and they become half-paralyzed—is that like a loach? When they dwell in trees, they tremble and shudder in fear—is that like a monkey? Of these three, which knows the proper dwelling? People eat the flesh of livestock, deer eat grass, centipedes relish snakes, owls and crows delight in mice—of these four, which knows the proper flavor? Apes and monkeys take gibbons as mates, elk and deer couple with one another, loaches and fish swim together. Mao Qiang and Lady Li were considered beautiful by people; yet when fish saw them, they dove deep, when birds saw them, they flew high, when elk and deer saw them, they bolted away. Of these four, which knows the proper beauty of the world? From my perspective, the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and chaotic—how could I know their distinctions?”

Nie Que said, “If you do not know benefit and harm, does the Perfected Person likewise not know benefit and harm?”

Wang Ni replied, “The Perfected Person is spirit-like! When great marshes burn, they cannot be made hot; when rivers and lakes freeze, they cannot be made cold; when swift thunder splits mountains and winds shake the sea, they cannot be made startling. One such as this rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the Four Seas. Life and death bring no change to them—how much less the beginnings of benefit and harm!”

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
What is agreed upon is not necessarily right; what differs is not uniquely wrong. Neither self nor other can correct the other, so there is no use for knowledge. If one claims to know what one does not know, this is to possess knowledge yet be unable to entrust things to their own proper places. Thus, Nie Que asked three times, and Wang Ni answered with three “I do not know.”

“How can you be certain that what I call knowing is not not-knowing, or that not-knowing is not knowing? Fish swim in water—all aquatic creatures share this, and all call it knowing. Yet from the perspective of birds, what was previously called knowing becomes not-knowing. Thus, I cite people, loaches, and monkeys to illustrate the differing conveniences of the myriad things. Next, I cite people, deer, centipedes, and crows to show that beauty and ugliness have no fixed master. Then I cite apes, gibbons, elk, deer, loaches, fish, Mao Qiang, and Lady Li to demonstrate that what the world finds pleasing differs. If one were to reject what differs, there would be no way to know what is agreed upon as certainly right. Only by not disputing them can all things be left in their natural state.”

Nie Que had not yet grasped the subtlety of not-knowing and still suspected that the Perfected Person ought to know. This doubt remained unresolved. The Perfected Person is spirit-like, for their essence merges with things. Though they encounter the most extreme changes, they never depart from the self.

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:**
To know the limit of not-knowing is what all things agree upon as right. To know what all things agree upon as right is not not-knowing. Only the Dao cannot be known; knowing it is the very reason for not-knowing. Not-knowing is the reason for knowing it—thus the essence of the Dao becomes visible.

Now, people take bodily comfort and ease as the proper dwelling, the taste of livestock as the proper flavor, and beautiful appearances as the proper beauty. As for what gibbons and monkeys find comfortable, what centipedes and crows find sweet, and how fish, birds, elk, and deer pair with one another—each takes what it knows as the proper standard of knowing. Then how can people and the myriad things have a proper dwelling, proper flavor, or proper beauty? If one truly cannot determine the proper dwelling, flavor, or beauty yet claims to know them, then what they know is clearly not right. Thus, from my perspective, benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong are tangled and chaotic—how could I know their distinctions? This is why there are four questions and four “I do not know.”

The Perfected Person is spirit-like, for spirit subtly encompasses the myriad things in its expressions. The myriad things are none other than the self, yet the self is nothing at all. Who could make them cold or hot, startling or fearful?

**Lin Yidu’s Commentary:**
People and birds and beasts each follow their own preferences, mutually loving and hating—who knows the proper dwelling, proper flavor, or proper beauty of the world? The proper dwelling of the world is that there is no proper dwelling. The proper flavor of the world is that there is no proper flavor. The proper beauty of the world is that there is no proper beauty. Yet those who take nothingness as right see only nothingness, so they speak only of the differences between having dwellings, flavors, and colors, not of nothingness as the proper standard.

From my perspective, right and wrong, benevolence and righteousness, are tangled and chaotic—whom could one follow to correct them? Thus, not knowing their distinctions is precisely how one distinguishes them.

**Chen Xiangdao’s Commentary:**
The Dao takes not-knowing as its inner aspect and knowing as its outer. Thus, knowing is not-knowing, and not-knowing is knowing. Yet even knowing through not-knowing does not escape the taint of having, so one cannot definitively say whether it is knowing or not-knowing. Moreover, one does not speak of having no dwelling, flavor, or color as the proper standard—all this is merely to cast off the burden of discriminating words.

When marshes burn yet one is not hot, when rivers freeze yet one is not cold, when swift thunder does not startle—this is because one’s heavenly integrity is whole and one’s spirit does not retreat.

Riding the clouds and qi, mounting the sun and moon—thus one is not swift yet arrives swiftly, does not move yet reaches. **Chen Bixu’s Commentary:** Taking sameness as right results in no wrong; taking wrong as sameness results in no right. All things differ in form and kind, each unaware of the other. Though one may forget all knowing, each thing remains as it is. Moreover, what I know is commonly called "not knowing," for the other does not know this. What I do not know is commonly called "knowing," yet things do not know one another. What I call knowing is the principle of the myriad things; what I do not know is the nature of the myriad things. Thus, on the Hao Bridge, how could one truly know the joy of the minnows? The cicada drinks but does not eat; the silkworm eats but does not drink—each unaware of why it is so. All things differ in form and kind, and so too do their colors and flavors. Their natures and dispositions are endowed differently—how can they be forcibly equalized? Thus, benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong are matters the sage does not distinguish.

The perfected person’s spiritual transformations are unfathomable, so the workings of creation cannot alter them. The square inch of the heart is empty. The body is not one’s own—thus one may ride the clouds and qi. Hearing and sight are unused—thus one may mount the sun and moon. Wherever one is, it is fitting—thus one may wander the four seas. Life and death do not change it; what do gain and loss matter? **Zhao Xuqi’s Commentary:** What I call knowing is not necessarily knowing; what I call not knowing is not necessarily not knowing. Confucius said: "Do I possess knowledge? No, I do not." To speak of it is to reach the point of "no knowing"—only then is it true knowing. In dwelling, flavor, and color, humans, birds, and beasts each find what suits them; they cannot all be the same. Mencius said: "The nature of a dog is like the nature of an ox; the nature of an ox is like the nature of a man." This is precisely the same idea. To recognize the rightness of dwelling, color, and flavor, one must depart from dwelling, color, and flavor—only then is there true recognition. To know the rightness of benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong, one must depart from benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong—only then is there true knowing.

Nie Que again asked about the perfected person, and Wang Ni replied with the tale of the divine person of Mount Guye. Both were speaking in parables. **Yongzhai Jiangyi** states: Nie Que’s question about sameness and rightness, and Wang Ni’s answer of "How would I know?"—this is knowing to stop at what one does not know. Knowing is not not-knowing; not-knowing is not knowing—this further means that not-knowing is true knowing. The subsequent discussion of right dwelling, right flavor, and right color is a metaphor for the absence of distinction between self and other. The conclusion on the chaotic entanglement of transformation and right/wrong is like the differences in dwelling, flavor, and color—how can they be distinguished? Wang Ni is already the perfected person, spiritually subtle and boundless. Unaffected by heat, cold, or startling thunder, he roams his mind at the beginning of the formless. Even life and death do not move his heart—how much less gain, loss, right, and wrong?

The various commentaries on Nie Que’s first question—"What do things share as right?"—seem to lack illumination. Examining the text’s intent, I say: what humans and things share is their nature; what differs is their dispositions. Nature flows into dispositions, and each thing takes itself as right. With their partial views, they point and criticize, debate differences and breed resentment, argue to extremes and ignite strife—even to the point of treating kin like strangers or enemies. The root of this trouble lies in the word "knowing," which gives rise to false distinctions. Thus, Wang Ni’s threefold answer—"How would I know?"—aims to turn Nie Que back to what he does not know, to grasp their shared nature and fathom the principle of great unity—then he will draw near the Dao. Fearing he may not yet comprehend, Wang Ni further illustrates with examples: the differing needs of humans, birds, and beasts prove that dwelling, flavor, and color have no fixed rightness. Then what is called knowing—is it truly knowing? What is called not knowing—is it truly not knowing?

The highest ancients said: "Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know." Now that there are words, what is to be done with knowing? I say: gather much knowing to seek what is not known; follow the words to investigate what they express. Then who can say that not-knowing is not true knowing, or that having words is not wordlessness?

Qu Quezi asked Changwuzi: "I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs, does not pursue gain, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao; speaks without speaking, speaks where there is no speech, and roams beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered this reckless talk, but I believe it is the practice of the wondrous Dao. What do you think?" Changwuzi said: "The Yellow Emperor would have been enlightened by these words—how could Confucius understand them! Moreover, you are too hasty in your calculations. Seeing an egg, you seek a rooster to crow at dawn; seeing a slingshot, you seek a roasted owl. Let me speak to you recklessly, and you may listen recklessly. Why cling to the sun and moon or embrace the cosmos? Let them merge and flow, setting aside their slippery confusion, to honor one another as servants. The masses toil endlessly; the sage appears foolish and dull, blending the myriad ages into a single purity. All things are thus, and so they encompass one another. How do I know that delight in life is not delusion? How do I know that hatred of death is not like a lost youth who does not know the way home?

Li Ji was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her collar was soaked. Yet once she reached the king’s palace, shared his bed and mat, and ate fine meats, she regretted her tears. How do I know that the dead do not regret their earlier clinging to life? Those who dream of drinking wine wake to weep; those who dream of weeping wake to hunt. In their dreams, they do not know they are dreaming. Within the dream, they may even interpret it—only upon waking do they know it was a dream. And there is a great awakening—only then does one know this was all a great dream. Yet fools believe themselves awake, priding themselves on their knowing."

"O lord, O herdsman—how rigid you are! You and I, Qiu, are both dreaming; when I say you are dreaming, that too is a dream. Such words are called *diaogui* (consoling paradox). Should a great sage arise once in ten thousand generations to comprehend their meaning, it would be as if encountering them at dawn or dusk.

Guo Xiang’s note: Affairs come and principles respond of themselves—one does not follow and serve them. Proceeding directly without avoidance or pursuit, this alone is perfection. Without ‘that’ there would be no ‘this’; without ‘this’ there would be no ‘that.’ Thus, the speaker’s words are reckless, and the listener’s hearing is clear. Entrusting all to what lies beyond the dust and grime, merging obscurely with what transcends sight and sound.

Now, Quque hears reckless words and deems them the practice of the wondrous Dao—no different from seeing dawn and demanding the rooster’s crowing merit, or seeing a slingshot and expecting the owl’s roasted flesh. Let me speak recklessly, and you listen recklessly: to take life and death as day and night is to stand beside the sun and moon; to regard the ten thousand things as one body is to embrace the cosmos. Because there is that which is deemed base, hierarchy arises, and confusion and disorder follow, none able to set it right—better to leave it to its natural course, harmonizing with spontaneity.

Thus, the multitude toils and frets, while the sage remains still and unknowing, surveying ten thousand generations to grasp their changes—this may be called ‘mixed,’ yet it merges with transformation, ever wandering in solitude. Accumulate this over ten thousand years, and the ten thousand years become one ‘this.’ Accumulate ‘so’ over the ten thousand things, and the ten thousand things become one ‘so.’ How do we know that delight in life and dread of death are not delusion? Like Lady Li, within a single lifetime, emotions shift so drastically—how much more with the difference between life and death? Can they truly know one another? Observe the changes and differing feelings between waking and dreaming, and the desires of life and death cannot be the same. Though life and death differ, each attains its wish.

Just as one dreams without knowing it is a dream, so too in death one does not know it is death. Only with a great awakening does one realize this was all a great dream. Fools, dreaming, believe themselves awake, smugly taking their preferences as lords and their aversions as herdsmen—how narrow-minded! How much more so when they interpret dreams within dreams? This is no ordinary discourse; it is consoling yet strange, encountered once in ten thousand generations as if at dawn or dusk. Those who speak of the profound unity of life and death are exceedingly rare.

Lü Huiqing’s note: The sage knows neither benefit nor harm, thus neither approaches nor avoids; lacks nothing, thus neither rejoices nor seeks; follows no false path, thus does not cling to the Dao. ‘Having words’ is the very means to ‘having no words’; ‘having no words’ is the very means to ‘having words.’ Only the unburdened heart can attain this.

Quque once heard the Master’s words and dismissed them as reckless, then took them for the wondrous Dao—yet both are mistaken. The Dao is not carried by speech or silence. Thus, what the Yellow Emperor heard with clarity, how could Confucius comprehend it? The rooster’s crow arises from dawn, yet dawn is not the rooster’s crow; the owl’s roast comes from the slingshot, yet the slingshot is not the owl’s roast; the wondrous Dao emerges from what is heard, yet what is heard is not the wondrous Dao. Those who hear the Dao today believe themselves enlightened, yet do not know to diminish daily until reaching non-action—all are Quque’s ilk.

The Dao cannot be transmitted through words or received by ear. My speaking and your listening are both reckless—what is desired is to forget words and unite in mind. Know how the sun and moon are sun and moon, and merge with their light, then you may stand beside them. Know how the cosmos is the cosmos, and its mechanism lies in your grasp, then you may embrace it. For it is all-encompassing—this is the practice of the wondrous Dao, not merely hearing of it.

Confusion and hierarchy based on subordination are firmly set aside. The multitude labors without seeing success, while the sage appears foolish and unknowing, abiding without dissipation. Though ten thousand years pass, surveying and unifying them yields purity. The ten thousand things are all ‘so,’ and through this they interpenetrate—I embody the ten thousand things, and the ten thousand things are my body. Survey ten thousand years and unify them into purity, and a child who dies young may outlive Pengzu. The ten thousand things are all ‘so’ and interpenetrate through this, so a autumn hair may be greater than Mount Tai.

Viewed through Lady Li, how do we know the dead do not regret their earlier clinging to life? What then is there to delight in life or dread in death?

Lin Yidu’s note: The sage responds to inevitability—when has he ever pursued affairs? Without discrimination, there is no approach or avoidance; with a heart utterly sufficient, there is no seeking or clinging. Thus he may be silent when the time is for silence, speak when the time is for speech, and wander beyond the dust and grime. Hearing belongs to acuity, clarity to brightness—what the Yellow Emperor’s acuity and brightness attained was freedom from confusion and obstruction. How could Qiu comprehend it?

Like lips meeting, when things become confused and disordered, the wise set them aside to let each reach its limit. Ministers serve lords, servants serve ministers—this is the natural order. Allow their inequality without disturbing the mind’s equality. Thus, the foolish and the still do not differ; surveying the changes of ten thousand years and unifying them yields purity.

People all delight in life, yet life cannot be prolonged; all dread death, yet death cannot be avoided. At peace in life, like Lady Li in Ai’s borderlands; at peace in death, like Lady Li in the king’s palace. How do we know the dead do not regret their earlier clinging to life?

Chen Xiangdao’s note: The sage does not cut himself off from things, yet never forgets affairs without responding; does not let things burden him, yet never toils in service. What benefits me, I do not approach; what harms me, I do not avoid. Meeting the world’s demands, I do not rejoice or seek; merging with the Dao, I do not cling to it. Though silent all day, I have never been without words; though speaking all day, I have never had words."

The reckless miss the mark, while those who listen with clarity hear and understand. The Master deemed recklessness as falling short; Quque saw it as the wondrous Dao and thus overshot. Hence the saying: "To plan too early."

Dwelling beneath the sun and moon while embracing their radiance, living within the cosmos while holding it close—none but those who command yin and yang, who govern heaven and earth, are fit for such a task. When things align, act; act only when action is fitting. When they are muddled and turbid, set them aside; do not act when action is unfit.

Though one may serve as ruler and minister to another, such roles are but momentary alignments. The toiling, foolish hermit—this is what the *Laozi* calls "the crowd all have their means, while I alone am dull and coarse."

To encompass ten thousand years is to see antiquity as the present; to achieve purity is to see the many guided by the One. People all know the joy of life yet not its suffering; all know the dread of death yet not its rest. Thus, in clinging to life and fearing death, they do not see how their delight and aversion are delusions. How much less can they comprehend life and death?

The ancients called the dead "those who return," so the living are but "wayfarers." If one mourns the young dead without knowing their return, people call it delusion—yet is not living without knowing death also delusion? Life and death, going and returning, are like waking and dreaming. If the sorrows and joys of dreams are not to be taken as real, how can the sorrows and joys of waking be truly so?

Chen Bixu’s note: *Menglang* describes a lack of precision. *Ying* is the luster of jade. To judge jade, one should look, yet it speaks of "listening"—is this not confusion? The Yellow Emperor, master of the Dao, saw and heard without relying on eyes and ears. To still cling to words is like listening for jade’s luster.

The rooster heralds the dawn; the magpie knows when to roast. To grasp the Dao, one must rely on the heart—this has its root. Those who delight in superficial ends and hasty plans are but reckless, frivolous followers of fleeting sounds.

To "embrace the sun and moon" is to abide in constant illumination. To "hold the cosmos" is to encompass all. When things fit perfectly, act without hesitation. When they are muddled, set them aside and forget their contradictions.

To honor one another as servants is the toil of the vulgar world. The sage appears foolish and dull, his heart like cold ashes, his form withered. To unify the myriad ages into a single, pure whole is to traverse past and present as a single day’s dusk, to merge all transformations into undifferentiated perfection.

To find contentment in life and joy in death is still to remain within the bounds of yin and yang—how can one thus embody the profound mystery of the Dao? The maiden of Li Rong, having lost the bliss of Ai Feng, gained the favor of the state of Jin; abandoning one for the other, she clung to neither as if to drifting wood. Within a single lifetime, sorrow and joy remain unfathomable—how then can one lightly discuss the threshold of life and death?

Those who dream of drinking wine or weeping do so because of shifting emotions—such things are not found in the perfected person. To regard ten thousand generations as a single morning is the awakening of the truly enlightened. To see life and death as a single thread—how could there still be dreams? The foolish, in their dreams, believe themselves awake, exalting themselves as rulers and regarding others as mere herdsmen—how crude and narrow this is! The perfected person treats life and death as a great dream and transcends them as a great awakening. The multitude takes the mingling of souls as dreams and the opening of the body as wakefulness, inverting truth and delusion, bewildered by life and death.

Thus, the enlightened one utters these profound words on dreams and awakening to lament the strange illusions of those who chase death. The bonds of life and death, though without rope or knot, cannot be undone—yet if, after ten thousand generations, one encounters a great sage who loosens these fetters of life and death, it is as if meeting in the span of a single dawn and dusk.

Wang Pang’s note: The knowledge of the Confucians, confined to the realm of form and instrument, never fully grasped the Dao—what they did not know was true knowledge. All speech and hearing are insufficient to exhaust reality, and thus are called delusion. To "embrace the sun and moon" and "hold the cosmos" is understood only by those of keen insight; it cannot be explained to the multitude. Like finely minced meat that blends perfectly, one sets aside the world’s confusions, allowing each to reach its utmost without entanglement. As servants to lords and subordinates to superiors, this is the natural order, inherently without hierarchy.

The multitude is enslaved by confusion, while the sage merges with the formless. Between the span of ten thousand years and the transformations of the myriad things, the permutations of the husk and the kernel are countless. Unifying these changes into pure essence can be grasped by the heart but cannot be transmitted through words.

Next, the argument delights in life and abhors death, illustrated by the parable of Lady Li—its meaning is precise and fitting. This further clarifies the *Qi Wu Lun*: it begins by equalizing "this" and "that" and ends by unifying life and death. Once life and death are one, how can things not be equal? The truly awakened one is fundamentally without awakening; the term "awakening" is only provisionally applied in contrast to the unenlightened—it is the awakening of non-awakening. Awakening and non-awakening alike must not be clung to. The foolish, in their smug certainty of being awake, are still dreaming. Precisely because they have such dreams, I cannot but speak of dreams to them—yet the truly awakened one knows that awakening and dreaming are originally no different.

The ancients spoke only when compelled, and thus elucidated this point to console those who, though aligned with the ultimate truth, appear strange to the multitude.

Zhao Xuzhai’s note: The sage does not engage with the dust and grime of the world. This is what Changwu told Quque in ordinary times: Quque took it as the marvelous Dao, while Changwu dismissed it as imprecise. Quque still harbored doubts, so Changwu said to him: These few words are what the Yellow Emperor heard and saw—I do not know them. Moreover, you have not yet reached this understanding yet hastily deem it marvelous—is this not premature?

The practitioners of life-nurturing arts do not know where the great Dao resides. They take heaven and earth as doors and gates, Kan and Li as the hub and axle, seeking to harmonize with the creative transformations of their own bodies. What they cannot fathom, they set aside and do not speak of, instead arranging the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera into a hierarchy of ruler and minister—how can this suffice for true governance? This is to honor one another as servants while remaining unaware of the true ruler within.

The multitude toils in confusion, entangled in profit and harm, while the sage, appearing dull, knows yet does not speak. Each thing possesses this principle, emerging and entering the mechanism—how can one be certain that death is not more joyful than life? *Liezi* records that Yin of Zhou, who amassed great wealth, dreamed at night of being a servant, while his laborers dreamed of being lords. In their dreams, they were rulers or herdsmen as if it were their fixed state. Now, our exchange of questions and answers is already dream-speech; telling you this is a dream is also a dream. To call it "strange and uncanny" is to say that the whole world is lost in dreamlike delusion without realizing it—this is truly lamentable. After ten thousand generations, if a great sage appears—one who understands what no one else has known—able to comprehend this liberation, it is as if meeting in the span of a single dawn and dusk. To awaken to this truth takes but a moment.

*The Oral Teachings of Yongzhai* states: *Menglang* means lacking substance. "Listening to luster" means hearing and thereby understanding. "Premature judgment" refers to your words being as they are, yet hastily deeming them the practice of the marvelous Dao—this is seeing little yet thinking much of oneself. To "embrace the sun and moon," to "hold the cosmos in one’s bosom," to perfectly align with the ultimate truth and merge into oneness—these are the confusions the world clings to, exalting one another as servants, yet all are subordinates, creating their own hierarchies. The multitude toils in confusion, while the sage is utterly without knowledge, viewing ten thousand years as a single principle without admixture. Lady Li’s remorse and tears shatter the delusion of delighting in life and abhorring death; the shifts between drinking wine and weeping in dreams reveal the illusory nature of such transformations. Even the interpretation of dreams within dreams exhausts human sentiment—thus, when Wei Jie asked and Le Guang answered, their exchange did not reach profound understanding.

The "great awakening" is the great enlightenment. "Ruler and herdsman" refer to the distinctions of noble and base. "Strange and uncanny" means utterly bizarre. My words may seem utterly bizarre, yet they contain profound truth. After ten thousand generations, if a great sage appears, his insights will meet mine as if in the span of a single dawn and dusk.

This will also be understood by later generations, such as Yang Ziyun, who grasp my intent.

The sage acts through non-action, allowing things to follow their own course—thus, profit and harm neither reach nor touch him, for he does not deliberately seek to avoid or embrace them. Without craving, the heart’s chamber remains empty; without clinging to the Dao, even emptiness is forgotten. He issues commands without speaking, as if silence were speech. He speaks without obstruction, as if speech were silence. In this state, how could dust or defilement ever stain him?

This is what Quchue had heard from the Master in daily discourse, dismissing it as reckless talk while believing himself to be practicing the wondrous Way. When he sought confirmation from Changwu, Changwu replied that these words were indeed profound, yet only the Yellow Emperor could fully comprehend them—he feared even the Master might not fully grasp them, let alone Quchue, whose cultivation remained incomplete. To merely admire their beauty was premature, like seeing the dawn and demanding the hour of dusk.

"Let me speak recklessly," he said, "and you listen recklessly—what do you think?"

To carry the sun and moon at one’s side and embrace the cosmos—this is the work of spirit-men, not something to be discussed with those who do not share the radiance of sun and moon or take heaven and earth as their constant. If one can practice what was previously described of the sage, then one may advance toward this. The key lies in carefully discerning what aligns with nature and acting accordingly, while setting aside what is entangled in the vulgar. Proceeding from the subtle to the wondrous, ascending step by step, is like the hierarchical reverence among men: servants defer to scholars, scholars to grand officers, grand officers to ministers, each rank rising above the last—until the sage enters the realm of the spirit.

The common people, blind to this, are enslaved by their knowledge and perceptions, unable to rest even for a moment. The sage, appearing foolish and undiscerning, unifies the myriad years and the chaos of events into one, blending them into pure wholeness—transcending past and present, forgetting life and death. The sage does not merely perfect himself; he enables all things to bear witness to this Dao, ripening them through mutual resonance. Thus, he is born together with heaven and earth and becomes one with the ten thousand things.

The reason most people cannot attain this is that their hearts are deluded by delight in life and fear of death, while joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure ravage their nature. This is why the later text elaborates further to dispel their confusion. Observe Lady Li’s tears of remorse—how can we know that the dead do not regret their former clinging to life? The groundlessness of drinking wine and weeping, the endless transformations between waking and dreaming, and the interpretation of dreams within dreams—all serve as metaphors for those most deeply lost in the world’s delusions.

Only through the great awakening does one realize this is all a great dream. Yet fools, still dreaming, believe themselves awake, distinguishing ruler and herdsman, noble and base—how utterly blind and obstructed they are! If the whole world is dreaming, what division remains between self and other?

Thus, those who understand these words delight in their apt strangeness, while the deluded are shocked by their uncanniness. After ten thousand generations, one who grasps their meaning will meet them as if in the span of a single dawn and dusk. How rare are those in the world who truly comprehend this Dao!

The essence of this chapter lies in the two words "great awakening"—readers should ponder them deeply.

Quchue and Changwu are fictional names used in their dialogue. The "Master" refers to Confucius, though this is also a parable.

Suppose you and I were to debate: if you defeat me, does that mean you are right and I am wrong? If I defeat you, does that mean I am right and you are wrong? Is one of us right and the other wrong? Or are we both right or both wrong? Since neither of us can truly know, how can others resolve this? Whom should we ask to judge?

If we ask someone who agrees with you, how can they judge fairly, already sharing your view? If we ask someone who agrees with me, how can they judge fairly, already sharing my view? If we ask someone who differs from both of us, how can they judge fairly, being different from us both? If we ask someone who agrees with both of us, how can they judge fairly, already sharing our views?

Thus, neither you, nor I, nor others can truly know—must we wait for another? What does it mean to harmonize with the heavenly equilibrium?

It means: "Is" is not "is," "so" is not "so." If "is" is truly "is," then its difference from "is not" requires no debate. If "so" is truly "so," then its difference from "not so" requires no debate. The mutual dependence of changing voices is like their independence. Harmonizing with the heavenly equilibrium and following the boundless flow—this is how one exhausts the years.

Forgetting time, forgetting right and wrong, roused by the boundless, one lodges in the boundless.

Guo Xiang’s commentary: Only in not knowing does one maintain integrity; only in not seeing does one discern. Yet discernment is insufficient for self-assurance, for it remains opposed to things. Debating all day without resolution, nothing can be settled—one must leave it to self-correction. Agreement leads to affirmation, difference to negation, but neither is trustworthy. If "is" is truly "is," there will be no one to negate it. If "not" is truly "not," there will be no one to affirm it. Thus, right and wrong arise from contentiousness and rest in the heavenly balance. Entrust them to the twofold course and let them settle themselves.

Affirmation and negation, right and wrong—these cannot be resolved by relying on others. The world cannot correct itself; one must allow things to correct themselves. The debate over right and wrong is but the clamor of change, and such clamor, though mutually dependent, is insufficient for resolution—thus, it is as if independent. Harmonizing with nature’s divisions and following the boundless transformation, the realm of right and wrong naturally dissolves, and the subtleties of life and destiny are fully realized.

Forgetting time unifies life and death; forgetting right and wrong transcends affirmation and negation. Swept into oneness, this is the ultimate principle. The ultimate principle flows without limit, so those who lodge in it cannot be confined.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: The world’s so-called right and wrong are merely: I affirm what you negate, you affirm what I negate; sometimes affirming, sometimes negating; or both affirming, both negating—all arising from you and me. Since neither you nor I can truly know, the question of right and wrong remains ultimately unresolved.

Man is inherently shaped by his encounters—who then can correct him? Yet correction itself comes from man. If a man is not identical to oneself, he must be identical to another; if not different from oneself, he must differ from another. If not identical to both oneself and another, he must differ from both. This yields no more than four possibilities, yet none can truly correct him—thus, neither oneself, another, nor any man can truly know one another.

Does this depend on the other? The text says it does not. Only the sage understands this truth: though the interplay of transformation and sound appears dependent, it is as if independent. Then, right and wrong find no counterpart and rest in the equilibrium of heaven.

Why say this? Right and wrong have no inherent reality; they arise merely from the emergence of sound through transformation. Whether oneself and another are interdependent or not depends on the delusions of the discriminating mind. If one harmonizes with the natural boundary and does not engage in distinctions, follows the boundless unfolding, and responds to things by letting them grow, then the myriad things do not burden the heart.

To exhaust the years is to merge ten thousand ages into a single, undifferentiated whole. The absence of debate over "is" and "is not," "so" and "not so" arises from recognizing their shared essence—all things are thus. To exhaust the years is to forget time; to be free of right and wrong is to forget distinctions. It begins in the boundless and thus ends in the boundless.

Lin Yidu’s annotation: Zhuangzi further seeks to forget words, hence this discourse. Suppose you and I debate until it seems I am indeed wrong—he constructs arguments to dispel it. If I prevail over you, or you do not prevail over me, whom shall we ask to judge? This dispels what was already dispelled. If one identical to another judges, it amounts to being identical to both oneself and another—how then can it be judged? This dispelling, dispelled again, reaches the point where nothing remains to be dispelled—this is its ultimate refinement.

Words of "is" are not necessarily true; words of "so" are not necessarily so. Thus, their differences and similarities are equally undebatable. "So" and "is" oppose each other, yet both are subject to debate. There are those that transform, those that transform transformation, those that produce sound, and those that produce the sound of sound. The transformation of the transformer is not manifest without sound; the sound of the sounder is not evident without transformation. Transformation is the essence of sound; sound is the function of transformation—this is the interdependence of transformation and sound.

Yet sound emerges from transformation, which cannot know it. Transformation encompasses sound, which cannot recognize it. This is why they appear independent. Interdependence arises from two things; if all transformations are united as one, the path of interdependence cannot arise.

Sound is constant sound, not dependent on things to become sound—hearers merely generate hearing in response to things. Transformation is constant transformation, not dependent on sound to become transformation—observers merely generate understanding in response to sound. This is why they are interdependent yet appear independent.

As for the transformer of transformation, it is not transformed by transformation; the sounder of sound is not sounded by sound—what then is there of interdependence or independence?

Harmonizing with the root of life and destiny, following the residue of change and transformation, the years of past and present may be exhausted, yet that which constitutes the self is neither ancient nor modern and knows no limit.

Chen Xiangdao’s annotation: The "natural boundary" is the origin of life and destiny. "Boundless unfolding" is the endless flux of change. Harmonizing with the natural boundary and following the boundless unfolding, things and self are not obscured by right and wrong but each fulfills its allotted portion of life and destiny—this is what it means to exhaust the years.

To forget time is to unite life and death as one continuum; to forget distinctions is to merge affirmation and negation into a single thread. Life and death, affirmation and negation are inherently boundless—yet to know the one who forgets, how could one regard it as something substantial? It is merely lodged there.

Chen Bixu’s annotation: To awaken is to cease disputation; to dispute is to fail to awaken. Endless contention leaves no clarity, no convergence—only mutual distrust. When water is clear, it mirrors beauty and ugliness; when the heart is empty, it equalizes sameness and difference. If the center lacks mastery, one depends on externals, becoming a wanderer swept along by things.

From Jizi’s view, Bigan appears foolish; from Bigan’s view, Jizi seems base. From Guan [Zhong] and Yan [Ying]’s view, Boyi and Shuqi seem clever; from Boyi and Shuqi’s view, Guan and Yan seem gluttonous. Their choices clash, their desires diverge—who can set them right? Yet birds nest in trees, beasts rest in dens, each content in its own place—who says they are not equal?

For emotions of self and other are mutually dependent, just as disputes over right and wrong are echoes of transformation. If emotions do not depend on one another, where do self and other arise? If disputes lack right and wrong, where do echoes of transformation come from? Thus, empty the heart to harmonize with natural boundaries, and employ marvelous function to release stagnation—this is how one exhausts heaven’s years without entanglement in right and wrong. To exhaust heaven’s years is to forget time; to be free of right and wrong is to forget distinctions. Only then can one soar into the boundless.

With inexhaustible things and limitless principles, one merely lodges within the inexhaustible and limitless.

Zhao Xuqi’s annotation: Self-realized learning is difficult to express to others. Once spoken, debates arise—who can adjudicate them? Confucius said, *"No one understands me!"* and later, *"Is it only Heaven that understands me?"*—this is the same sentiment. Echoes of transformation depend on one another, like the chick’s peck and the mother’s tap occurring simultaneously.

Harmonizing with the natural boundary and following boundless unfolding is to blend one’s light and merge with the dust. Whether something *is* or *is not*, *so* or *not so*—none can be definitively disputed. Thus, when the whole world fails to understand and speech brings no resolution, it is because echoes of transformation do not depend on one another. In such cases, one should merely blend light with dust and delight in heaven’s years—why insist on clamorous argument?

To forget time and forget distinctions is to consign this life and this principle to oblivion. The Creator’s work is endless; we too become endless with it.

*The Common Studio’s Oral Exegesis* states: Victory and defeat do not determine right and wrong, so you and I, in our disputations, cannot truly know one another. Obscured by darkness, neither your vision nor mine is clear—who then can set us right? To argue in agreement with the other is impossible; to argue in agreement with oneself is also impossible. To argue in a way neither agrees with you nor me is impossible, just as arguing in a way that agrees with both is impossible. Thus, none of the three can truly know one another—one must depend on *that*.

*That* refers to the transformations of creation, the so-called "natural boundary." The act of harmonizing is simply to follow *this*. Whether *is* or *is not*, *so* or *not so*—both are preserved. If one insists on affirming *this* as *so* and *right*, then *not so* and *not right* arise, and disputes over right and wrong ensue.

"Echoes of transformation" refer to using words to convert and subdue. "Dependence" means opposition. If one opposes with right and wrong, with words, seeking to convert and subdue, how is this better than following what *is* without opposition? Thus it is said: If they do not depend on or oppose one another but instead seek unity, this is harmonizing with the natural boundary and roaming boundlessly to exhaust the years. In this way, one forgets both time and principle.

To stir and dance in the realm of nothingness—this "stirring" also conveys the meaning of *xiaoyaoyou* (carefree wandering). If one can truly be thus, one lodges for a lifetime in the realm of nothingness.

When right and wrong, victory and defeat each cling to one side and cannot correct one another, then you, I, and others all fail to know one another—must we depend on *that*? It is simply to entrust it to creation.

This passage’s various explanations are thorough, yet the meaning of "echoes of transformation" remains profound and obscure. The mechanism of dependence and non-dependence is also difficult to fully express in words. Only those who exhaust the spirit and penetrate transformation can illuminate it with the heart—then the ultimate principle becomes self-evident. Among the explanations, *Duli Lun* stands the highest, forming its own school of thought and complementing the classic text in depth and surface, surpassing mere philological study.

*The Common Studio*’s discussion of "echoes of transformation" is uniquely insightful, and its theory of the "boundless" is especially profound. To put it concisely: the distinctions between life and death, waking and dreaming arise from *transformation*. The disputes between self and other, right and wrong arise from *echoes*. Waking and dreaming depend on form; right and wrong arise from emotion—thus they seem mutually dependent. Yet *transformation* transforms on its own, unaware of how it transforms. *Echoes* resound on their own, unaware of how they resound—thus they seem not to depend on one another.

In the end, the utmost principle of things cannot escape the naturalness of creation. This is the source and convergence of all transformations, the great equality of the myriad things.

The discussion of "echoes of transformation" depending on one another shares the same meaning as the dependence of form and shadow—elucidated in both earlier and later passages.

Master Lü’s later appended note states: *"The dependence of echoes of transformation... thus exhausting the years"* should properly precede *"What does it mean to harmonize with the natural boundary?"* The text’s arrangement is disordered here; the meaning makes this clear.

The Shadowy Doubt asked the Shadow: *"Earlier you were walking, now you have stopped; earlier you were sitting, now you have risen—why this lack of constancy?"*
The Shadow replied: *"Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on snake scales or cicada wings? How could I know why I am thus? How could I know why I am not thus?"*

Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly—fluttering and joyous, a butterfly content in its own nature, unaware it was Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, palpably Zhou again. But was it Zhou dreaming he was a butterfly, or a butterfly now dreaming it is Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the transformation of things.

Guo Xiang’s commentary: The *wangliang* is the faint shadow beyond the shadow, where the heavenly mechanism operates of itself. In sitting and rising, it depends on nothing; in its solitary attainment, who knows the reason? To demand what it depends on, to trace its origin, is to arrive at last at the principle of dependence on nothing and solitary transformation. If it depended on snake scales or cicada wings, the lack of constancy would not be hard to explain. What makes it unknowable is precisely that it depends on no such thing but transforms alone.

Some say the *wangliang* depends on the shadow, the shadow on form, and form on the Creator. But is there a Creator? If not, how could it create things? If so, it would not suffice to produce the myriad forms. Clearly, the myriad forms create themselves and depend on nothing—this is the true nature of creation. The *wangliang*’s reliance on the shadow is like saying they arise together, not that one depends on the other. Thus, the *wangliang* is not controlled by the shadow, nor the shadow by form. Form is not transformed by nothingness; whether things transform or not, whether they are so or not, depends on others or on themselves. How could I know the reason?

When he dreamed he was a butterfly, he did not know he was Zhou; suddenly he awoke, and there he was, palpably Zhou. From Zhou’s perspective, this is called awakening—but it is not necessarily not a dream. Now, not knowing the butterfly is no different from the dream’s not knowing Zhou: each suits its own moment’s nature. Thus, there is no way to prove the butterfly is not now dreaming it is Zhou. There are cases of feigned sleep that yield dreams spanning a hundred years—how can we prove that this hundred years is not itself a dream in feigned sleep? The distinction between waking and dreaming is no different from the debate between life and death.

What makes him content in his own nature is that his role is fixed, not that there is no distinction. Time does not pause for an instant; the present does not endure. Yesterday’s dream has already transformed by today. The changes of life and death—how are they different? Why trouble the mind over them?

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: The *wangliang* and the shadow are of the same kind, yet it does not know the shadow depends on nothing for form. Just as you and I and others are of the same kind, yet do not know we depend on nothing beyond ourselves. The shadow’s walking and stopping, sitting and rising, merely follow form—thus it has no constancy. But being without emotion, how could it know dependence? If the shadow depends on form, what does form depend on to be so? The shadow’s dependence on form is not like a snake’s dependence on its scales to slither or a cicada’s on its wings to fly. How could one know why it is so or not so?

If one understands that things are without knowledge, then even snake scales and cicada wings depend on nothing. When he was a butterfly, he fluttered joyously, unaware of Zhou; when he was Zhou again, he was dazed, unaware of the butterfly. A single body’s changes—even these it does not know. How then could things, transforming into different forms, know one another? If things do not know one another, each returns to its root. If things do not depend on one another, none finds its counterpart. Is there anything that is not equal?

Lin Yidu’s commentary: The shadow arises from form, seeming to depend on it yet not truly depending. The *wangliang*, not knowing that both form and shadow belong to creation, assumes that walking and stopping, sitting and rising, depend on form. But without the light of sun or fire, even with form, how could a shadow arise? This is what is meant by not depending. The shadow says, “What I depend on also depends on something to be so”—what the shadow depends on is form, yet form cannot be without dependence, meaning it depends on creation. The shadow’s dependence on form is already slight, and form within creation is even smaller. Thus it says, “I depend on snake scales or cicada wings,” referring to the most minute and insubstantial of things. The *Outer Chapters*’ “insect’s arm, rat’s liver” conveys the same meaning.

Zhuangzi’s use of the butterfly is to show that dreaming and waking are no longer distinct. To understand the principle of Zhuang Zhou dreaming he was a butterfly is to exhaust the theory of life and death. Dreaming he was a butterfly, he did not know he was Zhou; waking as Zhou, he did not know he was a butterfly. There is a force that prevents their merging, and a time when they separate. The transformation of the myriad things is like this.

Chen Xiangdao’s commentary: The *wangliang* exists only after the shadow, the shadow appears only after form, and form is born only after creation. Form’s relation to creation is already illusory—how much more the shadow? The shadow’s relation to form is already external—how much more the *wangliang*? None of these are truly real, so they are not worth debating. To take what is not truly real as real, and then to question what is not worth debating—this is why Zhuangzi uses the shadow’s answer to dispel the doubt.

From the perspective of self-narration, the things of the world never fail to depend on one another; from the perspective of principle, they never begin to depend. If the shadow is a thing that depends on form—without sun or fire, it would not be seen. If it depends on sun or fire—without form, it would not exist. Then are form, shadow, sun, and fire truly dependent? Or without dependence? How could one know why they are so or not so? Snake scales and cicada wings refer to their minor uses. Those who awaken to the Dao grasp the substance and not the flower; those who are deluded by things grasp the flower and not the substance. The butterfly is a thing that grasps the flower; yet Zhou dreamed of it—this is to seek the Dao yet not escape the thought of things, to grasp the substance yet not escape the dream of the flower. When he awoke, he no longer allowed thought to burden his spirit or dreams to replace reality. Thus, Zhou and the butterfly were indeed distinct.

Only those who fully comprehend the transformations of things and the essence of change may partake in this discourse.

Chen Bixu’s annotation: The shadow does not depend on form, nor does form depend on yin and yang—how could they be compared to the molted skins of snakes or the cast shells of cicadas, which are mere things? Among all interdependent phenomena, none are so closely bound as form and shadow; yet even here, one speaks of their non-dependence, making clear that external things cannot be interlocked, for all things in the myriad realms are self-so. Only when all dependencies are utterly forgotten, standing alone in solitary transformation, may one discuss transcending life and death to return to primordial undifferentiation. This is what is called the "suspended liberation of the Emperor."

The natures of Zhou and the butterfly are but the wondrous existence of a single qi. Once, as a butterfly, it was Zhou’s dream; now, as Zhou again, is it not the butterfly’s dream? Though the distinction between Zhou and the butterfly differs, the wondrous qi of their existence is one. The mechanism of creation is subtle and unfathomable; if one could grasp this, then creation would reside within oneself and not be subject to external things. This is what is meant by "that which gives life does not live, that which transforms does not change." Once having become a thing, how could it not transform? The shift between death and life, the migration of forms—all is encompassed in the dream of the Painted Garden. Its principle is exhausted therein.

Zhao Xuzhai’s annotation: The shadow’s movement, stillness, sitting, and rising all depend on form; yet that which enables movement, stillness, sitting, and rising must have something that forms form within it. The snake relies on its ventral scales to move, the cicada on its wings to fly; yet what enables their movement and flight is not the scales or wings. Every motion and stillness of humans and things arises from dependence. The shadow depends on form, but what form depends on is not form itself. If even form does not know why it is so, how can one demand an explanation from the shadow? Thus, in Zhuang Zhou and the butterfly, self and other are both transformed, fluttering and wandering—waking and dreaming become as one.

*The Yongzhai Commentary* states: The shadow speaks of my movement, which depends on form, and form in turn depends on the Creator’s shaping of form—just as the snake’s scales and cicada’s wings. Once the snake and cicada have molted, their scales and wings remain, yet can they move on their own? I depend on form, and form depends on another—how can one know why things are so or not so? This is the metaphor of non-dependence on the other. Once, Zhou dreamed of the butterfly without knowing he was Zhou; upon waking as Zhou, was it not the butterfly’s dream? Yet this waking and dreaming must have a distinction; here, the text seems to conclude yet does not, refusing to state it plainly, precisely to prompt inquiry at this point. This is called "transformation of things," meaning the principle of the myriad things’ change is no more than this. The snake’s scales and cicada’s wings—some say they refer to molted shells, but the interpretation of "clinging scales and wings" is superior. For the snake relies on them to move, the cicada on them to fly, illustrating that what enables movement in the human body seems dependent yet ultimately is without dependence, thus clarifying the principle of solitary transformation. Therefore, the text repeatedly discusses this, ultimately returning to non-dependence, focusing on the individual. Hearing with the ears, seeing with the eyes, grasping with the hands, walking with the feet—all arise from dependence. Yet that which employs form seems to depend on the Creator but is in truth without dependence.

All things under heaven are born from being, and being is born from non-being. Being is for utility, non-being is for function. Thus, being and non-being, utility and function, are never without mutual generation. If one can reverse inquiry to the wondrousness of ultimate non-being and wander at the origin of things, then one will understand how being arises and how form is employed. Now, with form for movement and a mind for thought, one still does not know what governs them—then how can the shadow’s generation from form be known by the penumbra? No wonder confusion arises and questions are asked.

*The Parables* chapter contains the passage where the multitude of penumbras question the shadow, illustrating how the deluded in the world are many, hence the text does not address it uniformly. It states: "You are the cicada’s shell. The snake is its molt." This aligns with the meaning of scales and wings here. The original text once said: "The true person of old did not dream in sleep," yet Master Nanhua himself spoke of dreaming as a butterfly—why? It is to borrow waking and dreaming to establish the unity of life and death. Not knowing death while alive is like not knowing life while dead; though the two do not know each other, their principle is fundamentally the same. If one observes this through waking and dreaming, the nest will be visible. Why should one worry about death while alive or envy life while dead?

The butterfly, as a creature, has no nest-building toil, no hunger or thirst to rest from; it flutters and dances, roaming freely between heaven and earth. Those who see it delight in its self-contentment and do it no harm. Its generation is unrelated to species—often it transforms from other insects or arises from rotting wheat.

The *Zhile* chapter records that the root of the crow’s-foot plant becomes a *ji’ao* grub, while its leaves transform into butterflies—thus they too emerge from the transformation of plants, their origin unfathomable and their end equally unknown. Such are the Dao-attainers amidst the fluttering and flying, and thus the perfected sometimes dream of them. Man and things, though their forms diverge into many kinds, all receive their nature from spontaneity. Spontaneity is the subtlety of the supreme Dao, the foundation upon which the ten thousand transformations stand. Thus Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream and waking, though each knows not the other, ultimately return to transformation—there is no difference between them. We come to know that the ten thousand forms of movement and stillness, the ten thousand changes of life and death, the sentient and the insentient, all ultimately equalize in transformation. Transformation is the beginning and end of form and number, the egress and ingress of the ten thousand kinds, driven by the Creator’s arrangement. The bold and strong cannot resist it; things receive their carving and polishing, their forms return to the mold—unaware of the *how* yet thus it is. Therefore the enlightened surrender and follow it. Thus waking and dreaming merge, life and death become one.

Yet Zhou (Zhuangzi) and the butterfly must have their distinction—this distinction is the Heaven of things. Though each thing has its own Heaven, they fundamentally share the same Heaven. If one reads *fen* (distinction) literally, distinctions multiply endlessly, and how could the principle of the world’s things achieve unity and transformation with them? If there remains an untransformed element, viewing life and death as waking and dreaming, regarding past and present as morning and evening—then what things could be equalized, and what room would there be for discourse?

Yet Zhuangzi and the butterfly, dream and waking, have already been discussed—there must be those who understand. *Mencius* says: “The inequality of things is the nature of things.” Yet Zhuangzi titles his chapter *The Equality of Things*—some suspect this contradicts the Confucians, further emphasizing the inequality of natures. They fail to consider that Mencius spoke only for Xuzi’s sake. Moreover, what Mencius addressed was *qing* (nature/feeling), while what Zhuangzi addressed was *li* (principle). When principle is one but its manifestations are many, the inequality of natures is fitting. Thus Nanhua (Zhuangzi) originally pursued the ultimate, taking one principle to equalize the world’s discourses on things.

At the chapter’s outset, he sets up a dialogue between two masters, elaborating on the inequality of human and earthly *lai* (pipings), to clarify the spontaneity of Heaven’s *lai*—not only does principle not await equalization, but equalization does not reach it. Thus, through side proofs and oblique references, he does not directly name Heaven’s *lai*, desiring that the mind契合 and grasp it naturally. The myriad living things, red and profuse, undergo ten thousand changes of flourishing and withering, each with its own form and color, each with its own dissolution and rest—ultimately returning to Heaven’s *lai* and stopping there. Heaven’s *lai* is without form or sound, yet the source from which form and sound arise, the manifestation of divine transformation.

If one thoroughly investigates the origins of the multitudinous workings of human and earthly *lai*, then Heaven’s *lai* may be known. Thus Guo Xiang’s commentary states: “Is there yet another thing? It is simply the myriad apertures, like bamboo joined to the realm of the living, converging to form one Heaven.” As for knowing words, waking and dreaming, the completed mind, the affirmation and negation of speech, the arising and perishing of right and wrong—these differ not from the myriad apertures roaring in fury. Yet when one attains the center of the ring to respond to the inexhaustible, then emptiness awaits things, and things are without obstruction. This is forgetting and that transforming of itself—what the wind achieves when apertures are empty.

“Heaven and earth are one finger; the ten thousand things are one horse”—this is equalizing the unequal. Vast, forgotten, strange, and wondrous, the Dao unites them as one, equalizing without awaiting equalization. As for the monkey-keeper’s distribution of chestnuts, the joy and anger that arise therefrom, and Zhaowen’s zither playing with its gains and losses—these illustrate that having a mind and acting are insufficient to transform things, so how can one hope for equalization? Only when “Heaven and earth and I are born together, and the ten thousand things and I are one” can one speak of equalization! Yet one fears that some may take one and words as two, two and one as three—this is the omen of scattering and inequality.

Only by reaching the state before things ever began, pouring from the inexhaustible, knowing the great dream through great awakening, and unifying the ten thousand years into one pure whole—this is the way to grasp the world’s things and equalize them. The shadow’s attendant asks the shadow, not knowing that difference lies in waiting. Nanhua’s butterfly dream—who can fathom whether it is sameness or difference? Thus he exhaustively discusses the inequality of self and things, life and death, waking and dreaming, yet ultimately returns to the transformation of things. What Nanhua calls *hua* (transformation) is what the *Great Change* calls *shen* (spirit) latent in the indistinct; it appears in daily use yet cannot be known through knowledge.

From this, one awakens: the ten thousand things are one form, the ten thousand forms are one transformation, the ten thousand transformations are one spirit. When spirit is illuminated and transformation is penetrated—who is the thing, and who am I? This is called the great equalization. *The Profound Meaning of the Nanhua True Scripture*, Scroll Four ends.

**Inner Chapters: The Main Principle of Nurturing Life, First**

Our life has limits, but knowledge is without bounds.
To pursue the boundless with the limited is perilous;
and to persist in such pursuit is perilous indeed.

In doing good, do not seek fame;
in doing evil, do not court punishment.
Follow the central course as your guiding principle—
thus may you preserve the body,
perfect life,
nurture your kin,
and fulfill your years.

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
Life has limits, for one’s allotment is finite.
To lift the heavy while grasping the light is bounded by one’s strength.
Those who crave victory may strain their sinews to the utmost,
yet their desires remain unfulfilled—such is the boundlessness of knowledge.
The name of knowledge arises from imbalance
and vanishes into profound extremity.
Profound extremity means following one’s allotted measure
without the slightest excess.
Though bearing a weight of ten thousand *jun*,
one may suddenly forget its heaviness upon the body;
though responding to ten thousand affairs,
one may obliviously forget their presence within oneself.
This is the main principle of nurturing life.
If one uses finite life to chase boundless knowledge,
how can one not become exhausted?
Having exhausted oneself, to then seek knowledge as a remedy
is to harm one’s true nature while attempting to nurture it—
great peril indeed.
One must forget good and evil and abide in the center,
letting the ten thousand things act of themselves,
merging obscurely with what is most fitting.
Thus, punishment and fame remain distant,
while the integrity of principle resides within.
For one who can take the central course as constant,
every affair becomes a means of nurturing life.
Not seeking excess, one fully realizes principle and fulfills one’s years.

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:**
Life follows form and thus has an end;
knowledge pursues things and thus is endless.
To let life follow knowledge is perilous indeed.
To persist in such pursuit is perilous to the end.
When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;
when all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness arises.
Good and evil both arise from knowledge—
how far apart are they?
Only by not upholding the conduct of benevolence and righteousness to seek fame above,
nor indulging in depravity and perversion to court punishment below,
abandoning both good and evil and following what cannot be otherwise as one’s constant—
this is to still the mind, relinquish knowledge,
and rest in the Dao of unknowing.
What more could be added to preserving the body,
perfecting life,
nurturing one’s kin,
and fulfilling one’s years?

**Lin Yidu’s Commentary:**
What has form cannot be prolonged by yin and yang;
what is formless cannot be exhausted by fate’s reckoning.
Thus, to pursue boundless knowledge with finite life is perilous indeed.
When true nature is rent, good and evil arise;
when good and evil are established, fame and punishment follow.
To do good without seeking fame is the true good of all under heaven.
To do evil without courting punishment is the true evil of all under heaven.
Only by following the natural tendencies of life and destiny
without diminishing or adding,
merging with the ten thousand things without harm or praise—
then punishment and fame cannot reach one.
The reason fame for goodness exists is that it is established by those who fall short.
The reason fame for evil exists is that it is born of excess.
Some lightly regard life and rush toward righteousness to seek fleeting fame;
some value life and chase profit, only to perish midway—
these are what is meant by "good that seeks fame" and "evil that courts punishment,"
not the following of life’s natural tendencies by removing what is excessive.
**Chen Xiangdao’s Commentary:**
Those who skillfully nurture life take the self as master within
and external things as guests.
Not pursuing the boundless with the limited, one avoids peril.
Moving from the heart without violating what is naturally desired—
the joys of the present body are not to be forsaken.
Thus, one is not swayed by fame.
Roaming in accord with one’s nature,
not opposing what the ten thousand things desire—
posthumous fame is not to be sought.
Thus, one is not reached by punishment.
Following the central course in response,
arising only when unavoidable,
taking this as constant without excess—
then within oneself, there is no conflict with things,
and in others, there is no harm to oneself.
Thus may one preserve the body and nurture one’s kin,
perfect life and fulfill one’s years.
The *Book of Changes* says:
"Goodness not accumulated is insufficient to establish fame;
evil not accumulated is insufficient to destroy the body."
Thus, doing good is never without proximity to fame,
and doing evil is never without proximity to punishment.
Yet when Zhuangzi speaks of this,
his "good" is not apart from the Dao—
it is merely what lies within one’s allotment.
His "evil" is not a transgression of principle—
it is merely different from good.
Laozi said to Nanrong Chu:
"Your centrality still brims with what you deem evil."
The "evil" he speaks of is like this—
thus his "good" may be known.

**Chen Bixu’s Commentary:**
Longevity and early death are the limits of life.
Vast learning is the boundlessness of knowledge.
What is granted by heaven is profound and unknowable;
what is done by humans is laborious and rife with flaws.
Thus, the main principle of life’s pattern lies in skillful nurturing.
Yet some prize fame and chase profit, never resting,
ever increasing artifice to the detriment of their lives,
until peril is all that remains.
The goodness of self-preservation lies in not seeking fame—
this means guarding simplicity with minimal change,
like the people of Hanyin.
The evil of self-harm lies in not courting punishment—
this means sinking into indulgence,
like the followers of Gongsun Chao and Mu.
To neither do good nor do evil,
to take the central course as constant—
this is the middle way of the sage,
which can preserve the body,
perfect life,
nurture one’s kin,
and fulfill one’s years.
This is the main principle of what gives rise to life.

**Zhao Xuzhai’s Commentary:**
From youth to prime, from prime to old age,
from old age to death—
this is the finitude of life.
Weaving through ten thousand affairs,
enduring from ancient times to the present—
this is the boundlessness of knowledge.
Yet people, deluded by false knowledge, toil endlessly,
believing they know peril.
Life has an end, and knowledge too has an end—
when form transforms, the heart follows.
Can this not be called great sorrow?
In the world, doing good brings endless praise;
doing evil brings endless blame.
Boyi died for fame, Robber Zhi died for profit—
though what they died for differed,
the harm to life and injury to nature were the same.
Evil is certainly not to be done,
but neither must good be done—
for to do so is to act with intention.
One should only follow the central course as one’s guiding principle.

The Governing Vessel is the center. Before joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise, its response to things issues wholly from the spontaneity of nature, and what manifests externally is precisely this center. To follow nature is called the Dao—this is the meaning of "tracing the Governing Vessel as one’s guiding principle."

Among the eight extraordinary vessels, the central channel is the Governing Vessel. Lin’s *Yongzhai Oral Exegesis* states: "To make a finite body follow endless thoughts—when will such restless turmoil cease?" "Perilous" describes its dreadful danger; yet even amid peril, one applies mental calculation, believing oneself to be wise—only to end in peril nonetheless.

The passage "Do good without seeking fame, and you may fulfill your allotted years" is precisely the learning of the life-nurturing school, which Zhuangzi himself practiced. If one does good, there is no deed of fame-seeking to be praised; if one does evil, there is no criminal act to be pointed out—this is the conduct described in the "Webbed Toes" chapter: "Above, one dares not practice the seven virtues; below, one dares not commit perverse acts." Respond only when pressed, and respond without intention; make this one’s constant way, and one may preserve the body, fulfill life, nurture one’s kin, and complete one’s years—this is what Mencius meant by "whether long-lived or short-lived, one does not waver, but cultivates oneself and awaits destiny."

Chu’s *Personal Insights* states: The *Inner Chapters* begin with the "Free and Easy Wandering," the learning of fulfilling nature, to clarify the Dao. Next comes the "Discussion on Making All Things Equal," discourse on exhausting principle, to respond to transformation. Then follows the "Essentials of Nurturing Life," the essentials of preserving destiny, to cultivate the self. Thus, the opening argument warns that to make the finite follow the infinite is to let life take its natural course without the calamity of premature death. To return to the state before knowledge and revert to the ultimate undifferentiated darkness is to remove the harms that afflict the body—what peril could then remain? If one truly can do this, then one follows the world’s good and calls it good, follows the world’s evil and calls it evil; though one acts, it is as if one does not act—what encumbrance of fame-seeking or punishment could there be?

When people conduct themselves and engage with the world, there are good and evil acts they ought to perform. As for sages and worthies, who bear the weight of the world, uphold the moral order, and sustain living beings, there is even more they cannot but do regarding good and evil. Reward one person, and the world is encouraged; punish one person, and the world is admonished. Let the world’s likes and dislikes guide the world’s rewards and punishments—like the movement of heaven and earth, spring and summer give life and growth without claiming favor, autumn and winter bring sternness and decay without incurring resentment. For heaven and earth act without intention: cold and heat move of themselves, things grow and mature of themselves, things wither and decay of themselves—this is simply the way of the seasons, with no personal favor or resentment involved.

If Yi’s skill in hitting the mark is subtle yet clumsy in concealment, this is the good of fame-seeking. If one can be like a flying tile that strikes a person without provoking blame, then one avoids the nearness of punishment.

These two lines embody the meaning of the *Daodejing*’s "establishing virtue as if negligent." Some commentaries cite the sayings "goodness not accumulated is insufficient to make a name" and "evil not accumulated is insufficient to destroy the self" as proof—yet this is *acting* in a way that draws near to fame and punishment. Others cite "above, one dares not practice the conduct of benevolence and righteousness; below, one dares not engage in licentious and perverse deeds"—yet this is *not acting* in a way that avoids fame and punishment. Though the phrasing may seem similar, the meaning is fundamentally different. The present text’s intent is that what the common world calls good and evil is private and bounded, merely revealing its pettiness. What the sages and worthies call good and evil is impartial and without contention, acting through non-action. How could shallow understanding ever glimpse this?

Consider how the Four Fiends’ evil led Emperor Yao to remove them, how Jie and Zhou’s evil led Tang and Wu to exile them, and how Shaozheng Mao’s evil led the Master to execute him—thus the good and evil of the sages and worthies becomes clear. To do good or evil and draw near to fame or punishment, or to refrain from good or evil and remain without fame or punishment, are both the natural course of principle. Yet now, to act without drawing near to fame or punishment—this is what the common world sees as good or evil, while the hearts of sages and worthies ever accord with the central Way, aligning with the spontaneity of Heaven’s principle. Thus, profit and harm cannot reach them, and this is where the Dao and its virtue return.

The character *du* (督) glosses *zhong* (centrality), referring to the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise—not merely the midpoint between good and evil. If, in the moment before the seven emotions stir, one follows this as the constant Way, then emptiness, clarity, numinous penetration, and freedom from attachment arise. I and the Great Ultimate become one undifferentiated whole—how then could one know whether the body is preservable, life is whole, or kin are nurtured?

How can one exhaust the years? Master Guo glossed *du* (督) as "centrality" (*zhong* 中) but failed to clarify its meaning. Later, I obtained Xu Zhai’s precise and apt citations. Indeed, every human body possesses the *du mai* (督脉, Governor Vessel), which runs along the center of the spine, penetrating above and below, and is paired with the *ren mai* (壬脉, Conception Vessel)—this is where the root of life resides. Few who are not adept in the arts of nourishing life can fully fathom this. Thus, the seam down the center of a robe’s back is also called *du*, as noted in the *Liji* commentary on the *Shenyi*. When Pao Ding butchered an ox for Lord Wenhui, wherever his hand touched, shoulder leaned, foot pressed, or knee braced, the sounds of slicing and parting resounded in perfect harmony, matching the rhythm of the *Sanglin* dance and the cadence of the *Jingshou* melody. Lord Wenhui exclaimed, "Ah! How excellent! Has skill truly reached such heights?"

Pao Ding laid down his knife and replied, "What your servant delights in is the Dao, which transcends mere skill. When I first began butchering oxen, all I saw was the whole ox. After three years, I no longer saw the ox in its entirety. Now, I encounter it with spirit rather than sight; my senses halt while my spirit moves. Following Heaven’s principle, I cleave through the great gaps, guide the blade through the great cavities, and proceed according to its inherent structure. I have never touched the tendons or ligaments, much less the great bones! A good butcher changes his knife once a year, for he cuts; an ordinary butcher changes his knife every month, for he hacks. My knife has lasted nineteen years, dissecting thousands of oxen, yet its edge remains as if freshly whetted. For where the joints have spaces, and the blade has no thickness, inserting the thicknessless into the spaced allows ample room for the blade to glide—thus, after nineteen years, its edge is still as if newly sharpened. Nevertheless, whenever I encounter a complex joint, I perceive the difficulty, grow cautious, focus my gaze, slow my movements, and wield the knife with utmost care. Suddenly, the ox falls apart like a clod of earth. I stand holding the knife, look around in satisfaction, then wipe it clean and put it away."

Lord Wenhui said, "Excellent! From Pao Ding’s words, I have learned how to nourish life."

**Guo’s Commentary:**
From "wherever his hand touched" to "matching the cadence of the *Jingshou* melody," this describes how he applied skill with ease, effortlessly parting the ox, aligning with its natural structure while harmonizing with rhythm—directly embodying the Dao in his craft, for what he delighted in was not mere skill. "All I saw was the whole ox" means he did not yet perceive the spaces within its structure. "I no longer saw the ox in its entirety" means he saw only those spaces. "Encountering it with spirit rather than sight" refers to meeting the principle without reliance on the eyes. "My senses halt while my spirit moves" means the faculties of perception cease, allowing the mind to follow the principle freely. "Following Heaven’s principle" means not forcing arbitrary cuts. "Cleaving through the great gaps" means separating where there are divisions. "Guiding the blade through the great cavities" means directing it through the empty spaces. "Proceeding according to its inherent structure" means the knife does not act recklessly, gliding through emptiness without ever encountering the slightest obstruction. Thus, after nineteen years, the blade remains as if newly whetted. "Whenever I encounter a complex joint" refers to the entangled and clustered parts; he halts his gaze, slows his movements, and wields the knife with utmost care. Suddenly, the ox is dismembered, its structure parted without trace of the blade, like scattered earth. At ease and self-content, he wipes the knife clean and puts it away—just as the knife is preserved through skillful use, so too is life preserved through skillful nourishment.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
Things are obstructed by their solidity, while the Dao flows through emptiness. Before one hears the Dao, all one sees are things; after hearing the Dao, all one sees is the Dao. "Encountering it with spirit rather than sight" illustrates how one who has heard the Dao grasps it with the heart rather than through sensory knowledge. "My senses halt while my spirit moves" and "following Heaven’s principle" to "the great bones" all describe how he no longer saw the ox in its entirety. Nothing in the world is not the Dao, and nowhere does it not flow freely—this is the principle at work. "All I saw was the whole ox" is a metaphor for those who change their knives and harm life. "After nineteen years, its edge remains as if newly whetted" is a metaphor for not harming life. In its form, the ox has never been a solid whole—does this not resemble the spaces between its joints? In its life, it has never been truly alive—does this not resemble the thicknessless edge of the blade? In its gliding, there is always ample room—does this not resemble one who embodies the Dao and roams among the ten thousand things? Nevertheless, "whenever I encounter a complex joint," I perceive the difficulty—this is where one must be cautious, for what humans fear cannot be taken lightly. Growing wary, focusing the gaze, slowing the movements, and finally wiping the knife clean to put it away—this is to be as careful at the end as at the beginning, ensuring no failure. Thus, one preserves life without harm.

**Yi Duzhu’s Commentary:**
The ox is a metaphor for the principle of life and destiny, while the knife represents life itself. By following the principle of life and destiny without contrivance, life unfolds naturally. Proceeding according to its constant principle, one harmonizes with the five notes and unites with music and dance. *Sanglin* is the music of Tang; *Jingshou* is the music of Yao. "Matching" refers to the harmony of sound and dance. Pao Ding claimed to lodge the subtlety of the Dao in the coarse craft of butchery—what he delighted in was not mere skill. At first, "all I saw was the whole ox" because he relied on sight. Later, "I no longer saw the ox in its entirety" because he encountered it with spirit. Now, relying solely on spiritual encounter rather than sight, the inner sinews, bones, and skin all become mysteriously aligned. As *Laozi* says, "Abandon sagacity and discard knowledge"—this refers to the halting of the senses. As the *Yijing* says, "Not hasty yet swift"—this refers to the movement of spirit. Following the principle of spontaneity, where there are great divisions, he cleaves them apart; where there are great cavities, he guides the blade through. All this proceeds according to its inherent structure—how could it involve forced, private skill? Thus, the tendons and minor obstructions were never touched—how much less the great, twisted bones? Though the good butcher and the ordinary butcher differ in the frequency of changing knives, both ultimately harm the blade—just as all ultimately harm life.

The common butcher speaks of the many, the skilled butcher speaks of the few, while the Cook Ding speaks of the singular—this is the divine butcher, is it not? With the blade of no thickness entering the spaces that exist, his edge remains as if newly whetted after nineteen years.

The common butcher, encountering the knotted joints of bone and flesh, sees only the difficulty of wielding the knife and must proceed with caution. His gaze halts, his movements slow—this is like the subtlety of life and destiny, where nurturing is even more difficult. When he lifts the knife and looks around, full of confidence, the ox is dissolved to the point where there is no longer any "dissolving." Honing the blade and storing it away, one understands that the perfected person acts only when unavoidable, then retreats to concealment in the profound.

The *Daode* commentary states: Those who rely on sight see only the object and not the principle; what they see is nothing but the ox. Those who encounter with spirit see the principle and not the object; they have never seen the whole ox. What they see is nothing but principle, and so with a blade of no thickness they enter the existing spaces, moving with effortless ease.

Is the Way of nurturing life different from this? The mind must be empty, not full; one must respond to things with compliance, not opposition. In ease, one meets it with appropriateness, no different from the resonance of sound; in difficulty, one handles it with care, no different from the stillness of caution. In success, one examines the path and considers the omens, no different from lifting the knife and looking around; in the end, one preserves wholeness and returns, no different from honing the blade and storing it away.

The masterful butcher, though he dissolves many, never touches the blade. The masterful responder to things, though he encounters much, never harms life.

The *Bixu* commentary states: With clear perception, one grasps principle; with consummate skill, one hits the mark. Cook Ding had long studied the Way of nurturing life and merely used his craft as a means of advancement. At first, he saw the ox and not the principle; later, he saw the principle and not the ox. Encountering with spirit rather than sight, he governed the internal by dismissing the external. The senses halted, the spirit moved—seeing and hearing were not through the ears and eyes. Following the principle of nature, he achieved a mysterious alignment, cleaving apart the great divisions and guiding the blade through the great cavities, moving freely in the void. He never touched the minor obstructions of tendons, much less the great, twisted bones! Thus, after nineteen years, his blade remained as if newly whetted. His knife moved with such subtlety that the ox was dissolved with a whisper—unaware even of its death.

The butcher, observing the empty spaces, dances the blade with consummate skill to preserve its wholeness. How could one who nurtures life fail to withdraw into deep seclusion, preserve the body without loss, and maintain the integrity of Heaven’s truth?

Li Shibiao’s discourse states: Things are fundamentally no-things; their essence naturally separates. The Dao is unobstructed—where is there need for dissolution? What Zhuangzi calls "dissolving the ox" is to separate from things and empty the mind so that one never sees the ox, to ride the void and follow the principle so that one never touches the blade—this is dissolution within non-dissolution.

Nineteen years is not a short time in the cycle of yin and yang; dissolving thousands of oxen is not a small number in responding to the changes of worldly affairs. Yet his blade remained as if newly whetted because, while traces shift in an instant, grasping the root ensures that the ancient and the present never depart. The self is but an illusion—what knife is there to wield? The myriad things are all delusions—what ox is there to dissolve? When self and things are forgotten, subject and object vanish. Thus, without cleaving, the great divisions naturally separate; without guiding, the great cavities naturally open. The knife moves with effortless grace, free from the labor of responding to things; when set down, it bears no burden of lingering attachments. In the end, honing the blade and storing it away returns one to non-use.

Viewed through the Dao, dissolution is non-dissolution; what is not an obstruction is dissolved, yet one does not know whether it is an obstruction or not—what is not dissolved becomes an obstruction. One does not compare Cook Ding to the common butcher, for the solver dissolves the obstruction; nor does one compare the common butcher to Cook Ding, for the obstructed obstructs the dissolution. When both dissolution and obstruction are dismissed, there is only emptiness. Roaming beyond the myriad things with this Dao, what could ever obstruct one?

Zhao’s commentary states: Cook Ding’s dissolution of the ox, his advances and retreats, his circling and turning, all harmonized with rhythm. The ox’s meridians and channels all converged at the head, and when the butcher’s blade struck precisely at this convergence, the hundred bones instantly fell apart. This is what elicited the astonishment of Lord Wenhui. Ding further explained that his skill had advanced to the level of the Dao. In difficult places, he was always cautious and fearful, his mind at rest, his gaze alert, his movements halting, his actions slow, ever wary of the slightest damage to his blade. Thus, after nineteen years, it remained as if newly whetted. For others, within a year or two, the blade would either chip or break. This is the way of one who nurtures life well.

The *Yongzhai Oral Exegesis* states: "Playing the blade" refers to the advance and use of the knife. "In harmony with sound" means it accords with the pitch-pipes. *Sanglin* and *Jingshou* are both names of musical compositions. "Never seeing the whole ox" means that the ox’s body, though divisible, is perceived through a single perspective. "Spiritual encounter" is akin to "mental communion." "The senses cease" means that ears and eyes perceive nothing, yet the unspoken spirit moves of itself, following the ox’s natural grain and the hollows of its bones and joints—all inherently so. I merely dissolve it accordingly. In wielding the blade, I never traverse the spaces between flesh and bone, much less the great bones. The difference between a skilled butcher and an ordinary one lies in how often they must replace their knives, yet both inevitably suffer damage. Here, after nineteen years, the blade remains as if newly whetted—this speaks to its undamaged state. With a blade of no thickness entering a body of interstices, the edge moves freely within—this speaks to the absence of obstruction. This is a metaphor for worldly affairs, all of which possess their own natural principles. Simply follow them, and the mind remains at ease; nothing can harm you.

The phrase "even so" carries profound meaning: in navigating life, how can one always encounter favorable circumstances? When faced with adversity, most grow flustered and lose composure. Yet if one bends and adapts, proceeding with equanimity, the heart remains unmoved. After the matter passes, it dissolves as if it had never occurred—this is the true efficacy of nurturing life. The *Butcher Ding* chapter conveys the essentials of life-nurture most intimately, depicting the precision of his movements and pauses to correspond with the rhythms of walking, standing, sitting, and lying down. Never for a moment does one depart from this, and the artistry of its portrayal is unmatched.

For all things under heaven, great or small, principle resides within. In dissecting the ox, one grasps its principle, and thus the eye no longer sees the whole ox, while the blade finds room to move. In nurturing life, one grasps its principle, and thus the body enjoys ample ease, and affairs proceed without hindrance. "Playing the blade in harmony with sound" is a metaphor for responding to things with perfect accord. "Laying down the blade and facing [the lord]" is a metaphor for forgetting life and attaining principle.

If the mind is set on responding to things, all one sees is the ox. But when embodying the Dao and merging with things, one never sees the whole ox. "Spiritual encounter without reliance on sight" means following nature, employing emptiness, and thus rendering knowledge and perception unnecessary. After nineteen years, the blade remains as if newly whetted—this speaks to one who never clashes with things, whose life suffers no harm, and whose nurturing of spirit is such that it endures without decay.

Yet whenever he reaches a dense cluster—seeing its difficulty, where bones and flesh intertwine in a tangle—this is a metaphor for the times when worldly affairs and social obligations grow complex and demanding. One must exercise caution and vigilance to achieve success, stabilizing the mind before responding. Ordinary people, however, pursue rich flavors, extravagant clothing, lavish dwellings, high rank, sensual pleasures, and fleeting joys as their means of nurture. The more they indulge, the more they lose their lives—this is what the classic means by "nurturing the form is ultimately insufficient to preserve life."

Now, Butcher Ding’s delight was in the Dao, and thus all he saw was the Dao. In all matters, he remained untroubled and unobstructed. Though adversity and fortune alternated, and myriad changes and setbacks arose, he ultimately resolved them with skill, as effortlessly as dust passing before him. How was this so?

For one who nurtures the master of life, mysterious virtue fills the inner self, and the true mechanism responds externally—whether in personal conduct or in dealing with things, all is fitting and harmonious. When the response is complete and one returns to nothingness, this is called "honing the blade and sheathing it." How could there be the wear of monthly sharpening?

The True Person, foreseeing that later generations of those who study life-nurture would drown in stillness and non-action, unable to engage with the world’s affairs, abandoning human matters while claiming the Dao can be established—such a Dao would be rare indeed! Thus, he embedded the Dao within a craft to convey his meaning, and whether the ox is dismembered or not becomes irrelevant.

Upon further reflection, "every encounter with the *zu*" seems to refer to the *zu*-butcher. Seeing the difficulty of the *zu*-butcher’s task, he pauses in caution, yet ultimately finds no difficulty. Li Shibiao’s interpretation aligns with this. From "pauses in caution" onward, Zhao’s punctuation diverges, which also makes sense, though the final phrase "the blade grows ever finer" feels incomplete.

Gongwen Xuan saw the Right Master and exclaimed in shock: "What manner of man is this? How can he be one-legged? Is this Heaven’s doing, or man’s?" The reply came: "It is Heaven, not man. Heaven’s creation made him thus solitary, while human appearance is shared. From this, we know it is Heaven, not man."

A marsh pheasant takes ten steps to peck, a hundred steps to drink, yet it does not seek to be fed and penned. Though its spirit may flourish, this is not goodness. Guo’s commentary: *Jie* refers to the name for partial amputation. What knowledge cannot overcome is Heaven’s doing; to defy what one knows is man’s. *Du* (solitary) points to the one-legged state. If a master’s knowledge cannot preserve both feet, then what knowledge cannot overcome is Heaven’s will. With the Right Master’s wisdom, if he insisted on preserving both, his spirit would be inwardly distressed, his form outwardly worn—how could it be merely a matter of one leg? "Having both" describes walking with two feet. An appearance of having both would never raise doubt as to its being fate. To take having both as fate is to know that the solitary one is not of oneself.

To roam freely in the realm of self-contentment is the subtlety of life-nurture—what need is there to enter a cage and submit to care? The pheasant’s spirit flourishes, its will and qi brimming with ease, wandering in the clear and open wild, so naturally that it does not even recognize goodness as goodness.

Lü’s commentary: The Right Master’s appearance was human, yet Heaven-made. Standing solitary and independent, Gongwen Xuan thus doubted he was human. "Heaven’s creation made him thus solitary" means his nature and life’s principle were originally so. As for engaging with things and having a shared appearance, that is merely human.

The marsh pheasant drinks and pecks freely, its heart roaming with Heaven, a metaphor for fulfilling its nature and life. Not seeking to be fed in a pen—though its spirit may flourish, this is not goodness—a metaphor for being constrained by the human world and unable to roam freely. Even if the care in the pen allows the spirit to flourish, it is not what is truly good, far inferior to the rare yet self-contented pecking and drinking in the marsh.

The *Yi Du* commentary: Heaven created this person with a solitary foot, while human appearance is shared. This speaks to life-nurture not residing in the physical form but in the flourishing of the spirit. Thus, the marsh pheasant, though drinking and pecking sparingly, remains spiritually unharmed. The abundance of grain and millet in the pen only burdens the body. Nurturing the spirit lies in aligning with one’s nature, which is why the ancients found utmost joy in a single acre of office, coarse food, and a gourd of drink—this clarifies the principle.

The *Xiang Dao* commentary: *Jie* means not communicating with things, solitary and without companions. The Right Master fully embodied what he received from Heaven, differing from those whose appearance is shared with others. Hence, Gongwen Xuan said: "..." As for the pheasant, it finds sustenance in the marsh yet is troubled when penned. When it dwells in the marsh, its spirit may be said to flourish; when troubled in the pen, even flourishing is not goodness. For in navigating the world and engaging with things, there is always something to guard against.

He who departs from man to enter the realm of Heaven never fails to find contentment in himself. The Right Master, startled by human affairs, reveals a spirit that flourishes in goodness—this much is clear. Yet when the pheasant’s spirit flourishes yet remains ungood, its alarm at human interference is equally evident.

The *Bixu* commentary: To do good yet escape misfortune is Heaven’s decree; to do evil and draw near to punishment is man’s doing. "Having companions" means mutual association, while "solitary and without companions" invites calamity from Heaven. Though one may violate laws and inherit folly, this too is not man’s doing. When a man’s form and appearance are whole and fair, he moves in company with others, making it difficult to admire such wholeness without forgetting his own flaws. How long has it been that men know not the origin of worldly affairs and their vicissitudes? When matters arise, they are perplexed by their causes; in their perplexity, external things harm them. Yet if one knows the cause of such harm, one may entrust it to its natural course, remaining inwardly free from alarm—thus avoiding deeper injury.

The *Zhao* commentary: The Right Master was Meng Ni. *Jie* refers to one who follows the example of the solitary. "No man lacks eyes, yet I alone am eyeless"—this is Heaven’s doing, not man’s. Thus he invokes the pheasant to explain himself. In the marsh, the pheasant pecks once every ten steps and drinks once every hundred, yet it cannot forget the snare, for its eyes see danger and fear harm. Such constant vigilance—how could it foresee that its true self would be caged and reared by man? The brightness of its two eyes is thus unreliable. Hence it is said: though its spirit flourishes, it is not good. The spirit resides in the eyes; when its essence and radiance manifest, it is called "flourishing." To rely on the eyes for vigilance yet fail to escape harm is worse than the eyeless, who entrust themselves wholly to Heaven.

*Yongzhai* says: The Right Master was a man who had lost a foot and served as the Right Master of the court. *Jie* means "solitary," for he retained but one foot. "Heaven’s doing or man’s?"—was his deformity Heaven-sent? Though amputation is clearly man’s work, he claimed it was Heaven’s doing that made him solitary. While others walk with two feet side by side, his singularity is Heaven’s design, not man’s. Moreover, the world’s excesses and deficiencies, though wrought by man, all stem from the Creator. When man faces hardship, he should accept it. The marsh pheasant pecks once every ten steps and drinks once every hundred, showing how hard it is to find food—yet it would not choose the ease of a cage, where food and drink are plentiful. Though the caged pheasant’s belly may be full, its spirit may flourish, yet it remains unhappy—hence it is called "not good." *Jie* is pronounced *wu*, meaning "severed foot." Master Cui’s version writes it as *ji* ("flesh"), but earlier commentaries differ in interpretation; the original pronunciation, explained as "partial amputation," is more fitting. The phrase "having companions" remains unclear; here, it is tentatively glossed as "of the same kind." Though the Right Master’s solitude was imposed by man, his single foot was Heaven’s portion, and his appearance remained akin to others. Moreover, endowed with the most refined form and an inner fullness, how could he abandon his wholeness because of a missing foot? Thus, he rested in fate and attributed it to Heaven, knowing that what should be preserved lies in virtue and nature. Virtue is born with life, and nature is life’s master—neither departs from these two, and this is called "receiving proper nurture." What does the mutilation of the body add or take away? To wish men to accept hardship and follow the natural course of their nature and fate is to preserve what is nobler than feet. What is nurtured is not the bodily form. Thus, the later analogy of the marsh pheasant takes joy in preserving its nature and sorrow in captivity. Revisiting the text’s intent: though the marsh pheasant’s drinking and pecking are arduous, it refuses domestication. If caged, though food and drink are abundant, it loses the freedom to fly and roam. Though its *form* may flourish, it is not good. Most versions read *shen* ("spirit"), but if its spirit flourished, how could it be called "not good"? Moreover, in confinement, there is no principle by which the spirit could flourish—this is a scribal error, left uncorrected.

**Inner Chapters: The Main Principle of Nurturing Life, Part Two**

When Lao Dan died, Qin Shi went to mourn him and wailed three times before departing. His disciples asked, "Was he not your master’s friend?" Qin Shi replied, "He was." "Then is such mourning proper?" "Yes," he said. "At first, I thought he was a true person, but now I see he was not. When I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own children, and youths weeping as if for their own mothers. Those who gathered there must have been moved to speak when they had no need to speak, to weep when they had no need to weep. This is fleeing from Heaven and doubling one’s emotions, forgetting what one has received—what the ancients called ‘the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.’ To come is the master’s timing; to depart is the master’s compliance. Abiding in timing and complying with the natural course, even a moment’s joy cannot enter—this the ancients called ‘the Great Release of the Sovereign.’

The finger is exhausted in fueling the fire, yet the fire is transmitted, and its end is unknown.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
Qin Shi mourned when others mourned and wailed when others wailed. His disciples found it strange that he did not stand by the door to observe the transformation, yet wailed three times. But the perfected person has no emotions and merely joins the crowd in wailing. The elders wept as if for their children, the youths as if for their mothers—this betrays a prior attachment to things, a failure to abide in principle, leading to such excessive love. The nature bestowed by Heaven has its own proper measure; it cannot be escaped, nor can it be augmented. To be overly moved by things, exceeding what is fitting, is to flee from Heaven. To gallop between the realms of sorrow and joy, though no external punishment has been inflicted, one’s nature and emotions are already exhausted—is this not a punishment? To come is to be born in due time; to depart is to die in accord with principle. Without timing, there is no peace; without compliance, there is no abiding. Merging obscurely with the transformations of creation, sorrow and joy have no place to insert themselves. To be bound is to be suspended; thus, to be unbound is the Great Release.

The fuel is like the previous fuel. The previous fuel is exhausted by the finger, yet the principle of fire’s transmission remains unbroken, so the fire is passed on without end. The heart attains the center of nurturance, so life continues without cessation. This clarifies that nurturing life is the very means by which life is generated. Time does not return, and the present does not pause. Human life is but a single breath, a single attainment. The previous breath is not the present breath, so nurturance continues life; the previous fire is not the later fire, so the fuel transmits the flame. The transmission of fire and the continuation of life arise from nurturance reaching its utmost. How could the world know that life ends only to be reborn?

**Lü’s Commentary:**
Mourning is a ritual: one weeps for the dead and consoles the living. Three wails make the mourning for the dead seem insufficient, while departing without words makes the consolation for the living seem inadequate. This is why the disciples doubted whether he was truly a friend and found such mourning improper. At first, I thought he was a true person, assuming that those who followed Lao Dan had all attained the Dao of nurturance. But seeing the elders and youths weep with such longing, unable to abide in timing and comply with the natural course, I knew he was not a true person. There must have been those who spoke when they had no need to speak, wept when they had no need to weep—inner and outer aligning to bring them together. What one receives from Heaven—one’s nature and the emotions of life—has never been touched by external things, yet they allow themselves to be moved by sorrow and joy. This is fleeing from Heaven and doubling one’s emotions, forgetting what one has received. There is no place that is not Heaven, yet they seek to flee from it—inevitably incurring punishment. Knowing that to come is to abide in timing and to depart is to comply with principle, the ancients called this "the Sovereign’s Great Release," for one has never truly died.

Fire depends on fuel, yet fire is not the fuel. As for the fuel, though the finger may exhaust it, the fire is transmitted without end. Why? The fire in this fuel is like the fire in that fuel—how could its transmission ever end? Fire is an analogy for life; fuel is an analogy for form. Understanding this, one knows that what makes life life has never died—how could sorrow or joy enter?

**Yi Du’s Commentary:**
The perfected person is fundamentally without emotion. That Qin Shi mourned and wailed for Lao Dan’s death was like the people mourning Yao’s death as if they had lost their parents. If he were not as insensate as wood or earth, how could he make the world forget its attachments? Yet what makes him seem emotional is merely his lack of fixation. The *Rites* say: "Those who understand life offer condolences; those who understand death grieve." Qin Shi offered condolences for Lao Dan’s life and wailed three times before departing, grieving for his death. His disciples found it strange that he stopped at three wails, questioning whether he was truly Laozi’s friend. He replied that three wails were sufficient. At first, I thought he was a true person, so I mourned when others mourned and wailed when others wailed. But now I see that fleeing from Heaven and doubling one’s emotions, forgetting what one has received, is not the way.

The body is like an excrescence; life and death are like night and day. How do we know the living are not dead ghosts, or the dead not living people? Why cling so desperately to sorrow and joy over life and death in one’s heart? The great earth exhales essence and breathes out qi, nurturing and forming things—none know whence they come. Though Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, cannot be called their parents, the deluded of the world cling to the love of parent and child and wail for them. How much more so when they mourn another’s kin as if it were their own child or mother? This is why people gather and unite in such excessive sorrow, speaking when they have no need to speak, weeping when they have no need to weep—these are the affairs of the mundane world. Qin Shi saw this as fleeing from nature, doubling sorrowful emotions, and forgetting the original nothingness of what we receive from creation. Heaven’s punishment is fate; to flee from fate is to be burdened by punishment and give rise to sorrow. To regard coming as timing and departing as compliance, sorrow and joy cannot enter—this the ancients called "the Sovereign’s Great Release." To have life is to be suspended; to be without life is to be released. When one attains the utmost of fate, one’s life endures beyond antiquity without aging, like the finger exhausted in fueling the fire, yet the fire is transmitted without end.

Liu Guo’s annotation: The analogy of firewood and flame illustrates the spirit’s lodging in form yet constant transference. The utmost person of antiquity bore the poised soul and regarded the bodily frame as a temporary abode precisely for this reason. How much less would they measure the body and lose reverence for its honored form?

Zhao’s annotation: Qin Shi wept for Laozi without sorrow, and his disciples doubted him. Shi then explained what he had witnessed. Some commentators have mistakenly assumed that Shi was dissatisfied with Laozi, believing it improper to evoke such intense grief in others. This entirely misses the original intent. Laozi, in life, harmonized his light with the dust and never clashed with things, yet people cherished him all the same. Thus, they spoke when there was no need to speak, wept when there was no need to weep. In his death, he fled from creation, turned his back on worldly sentiment, and forgot what he had received from Heaven—by this point, even Heaven could do nothing. Hence it is said: to flee from Heaven’s punishment, to regard coming as no cause for joy and departing as no cause for sorrow—this is what is meant by "resting in due time and complying with sequence." "Suspended" refers to the great affliction of having a body. "Released" means that only now do I know myself to be free. The "Sovereign’s Great Release" signifies that the Creator labors us with life and reposes us in death. The finger is exhausted in fueling the fire; when the firewood is spent, the flame ceases, yet that which does not cease endures eternally. Thus it is said: the fire is transmitted without end.

Yongzhai’s note: Qin Shi was a friend of Laozi. He wailed thrice and departed, demonstrating his freedom from attachment, which is why his disciples doubted and questioned him. Shi said: "At first, I took Laozi for an extraordinary man. Now, seeing his disciples weep as if for an elder or a youth, so excessively sorrowful, I realize Laozi must not have fully shed his bodily traces, for something moved their hearts beyond expectation. That which Heaven bestows is originally nothing, yet if one is stirred by sentiment, one forgets the original nothingness of what is received, flees from Heaven’s principle, and betrays the truth of emotion—all of which offend against Heaven. Hence it is said: to flee from Heaven’s punishment. Human life comes as it is fated; death departs as it is fated."

When one follows the seasons and accords with them, there is no cause for sorrow or joy. Knowing this principle, even Heaven cannot bind me with life and death—hence the saying: "The Sovereign’s suspended release."

The analogy of fire transmitted through fuel illustrates life and death: observe the fuel, and you see it must eventually be consumed, yet the fire in the world has never ceased from ancient times to the present. The argument reaches this point, then concludes with three metaphorical phrases—truly a stroke of genius. In previous commentaries, the character *zhi* (指) is often glossed as "to point with the hand," but if this were its meaning, the act of pointing would already be implied in the preceding text. Upon closer examination, *zhi* here should be understood as *zhi* (旨), meaning "principle" or "essence." The principle is exhausted in the fuel, yet the fire is transmitted without end—this meaning is perfectly clear. The *Knowledge Wanders North* chapter’s discussion of *zhou* (周), *bian* (遍), and *xian* (咸) as different names for the same reality, all pointing to a single essence, confirms this interpretation.

A single household’s fuel may be exhausted, but the fire of the world is inexhaustible, for those skilled in tending fuel know how to transmit it. A single person’s body may perish, but the spirit within it is without end, for those skilled in nurturing life know how to preserve it. The fire in that fuel is like the fire in this fuel, yet their flames differ. The spirit that lodges in a later body is like the spirit in the present body, yet each breath is distinct. The difference in flames explains why there is kindling and extinction; the distinctness of breaths explains why there is death and life. Yet the fire of the world has never been exhausted, nor has the spirit ever perished—because there are those who master them.

Consider how fire may be obtained by focusing sunlight, striking stone, drilling wood, or scraping bamboo. The nature of fire pervades heaven and earth, yet without human effort, it cannot be brought forth. The transformation of the spirit operates likewise. Remove the fuel, and to what does the fire cling? Destroy the form, and where does the spirit lodge? Thus we know that transmitting fire depends on obtaining fuel, and lodging the spirit depends on obtaining form—this is how the perfected person achieves wondrous use and completes the full work of heaven and earth. *Nanhua* invokes this to conclude the meaning of the *Preserving Life’s Integrity* chapter, profound indeed in its import!

Those who grasp the principle of nurturing form do not harm it; those who attain the Way of nurturing spirit act without contrivance. Form is the lodging of life; spirit is the master of life. The Way of emptiness and non-being is that by which one nurtures the spirit. Worldly people merely know how to nurture life, yet do not know how to nurture the master of life. The more they nurture, the more they lose life, so the true person teaches: "Do not let the finite follow the infinite"—this is the essence of nurturing life.

Those who hold the Dao in their hearts are without intention toward good or evil. Those who meet things with emptiness—what have they to do with fame or punishment? Accord with the mean and do not lose constancy; herein lies the principle of preserving the body and fulfilling one’s years. The analogy of butchering an ox illustrates responding to things, with the knife as a metaphor for life. After nineteen years, the blade is as if newly whetted, though it has passed through countless joints and complex cuts. Yet the sharpness and clarity of my skill grow ever more enduring—this is the master of life. One must nurture it well, for only through daily nurturing can one prevail in such moments, achieving great use through non-use.

As for "whetting the knife and concealing it," this means having leisure after responding to things, gathering one’s knowledge and veiling one’s brilliance. Things attain their proper state, affairs reach their principle, yet one’s efficacious use remains unharmed. The great recluses of old dwelled in the marketplace yet interacted with things, ever responsive yet ever tranquil—this is the Way they attained. Thus the essentials of learning the Dao begin with emptiness and stillness. Without emptiness, one cannot preserve the spirit; without stillness, one cannot return to the mandate. When nature is whole and the mandate is restored, the work of nurturing life is complete.

Like a mirror set before a stand, reflecting without leaving traces—what do things add to me? Ordinary people, chasing things and losing their true nature, entangled in affairs and resisting principle, tossed between gain and loss, their hearts filled with sorrow and resentment—how can their lives not be harmed? Hence the pheasant in the marsh does not wish to be caged, as illustrated in the later analogy.

Laozi, whom *Nanhua* revered as the greatest sage, spoke of death to teach people to rest in their time and abide in accord, to guard constancy and attain completion. Yet the wondrous transformation of following form and soaring beyond it is beyond the world’s comprehension—thus the saying: "The death of a sage is called *shen* (spirit)." Qin Shi mourned him with three cries, already an excess of world-transcending ritual, yet his disciples still harbored doubts. He therefore explained that coming and going are as they naturally are, and one should accept them without resistance—this is "the Sovereign’s suspended release," where the Creator cannot bind one.

To exhaust the principle of fuel is to transmit fire without end; to exhaust the principle of nurturing form is to preserve the spirit without loss.

The formed must end in exhaustion, yet I cannot but nurture it. Using the illusory to cultivate the real is also a principle of mutual support—only, it must not be as excessive as Zhang Yi’s futile over-nurturing. Thus, the ultimate value lies in preserving and returning to the form whole; when the whole is returned, the spirit suffers no misdirection. Emerging from being and entering non-being, where can one go that is not right?

Fuxi attained this and inherited the Mother of Qi; the Yellow Emperor attained this and ascended to the cloudy heavens; Fu Yue attained this and rode the tail of the Winnowing Basket to rank among the stars. The Most High said: "He who dies yet does not perish is long-lived."

**Chapter One: "The Human World"**
Yan Hui sought an audience with Confucius and asked to depart.
Confucius said: "Where to?"
He replied: "To Wei."
Confucius said: "What for?"
He replied: "I have heard that the lord of Wei is in his prime, yet his conduct is willful. He treats his state lightly and does not recognize his faults. He treats the people’s deaths lightly, and the dead are measured by the state as if they were rushes in a marsh—the people have nowhere to turn. I once heard you say: ‘Leave a well-ordered state; go to a disordered one. A physician’s gate sees many illnesses.’ I wish to apply what I have heard to reflect on its principles, that his state might perhaps be set right."
Confucius said: "Alas! You will likely go and be executed! The Way does not tolerate mixture; mixture leads to excess, excess to disorder, disorder to anxiety, and anxiety cannot be remedied.

The utmost person of old first established it in himself before establishing it in others. If what is established in oneself is not settled, how can one attend to the conduct of violent men? Moreover, do you know where virtue’s dissipation and knowledge’s emergence come from? Virtue dissipates for the sake of fame; knowledge emerges from contention. Fame is that by which people clash; knowledge is the instrument of contention. Both are inauspicious tools, not means for perfect conduct.

Furthermore, though virtue be deep and trust solid, if one does not penetrate others’ qi, and though fame be heard and uncontentious, if one does not penetrate others’ hearts—yet you would forcefully present the language of benevolence and righteousness, the carpenter’s square and ink line, before a violent man: this is to make others resent what they themselves lack, which is called ‘sowing resentment.’ One who sows resentment will surely be resented in return—you will be in danger as a husband to others!

Moreover, if you delight in the worthy and despise the unworthy, why would you seek to be different? If you lack the royal music, the lords will surely ride roughshod over you to vie for victory. Your eyes will be dazzled, your countenance smoothed, your mouth will flatter, your demeanor will conform, and your heart will comply. This is like quenching fire with fire, flooding water with water—it is called ‘adding to the excess.’ Following the beginning without end, if you persist in thick words without trust, you will surely die before the violent man!

In the past, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both were men who cultivated themselves to humble the people below and oppose their superiors above, so their lords used their cultivation to cast them out. These were lovers of fame. In the past, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xufang, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became wastelands of corpses, and they themselves were executed—yet their use of arms did not cease, and their pursuit of fame and substance knew no end. Have you alone not heard of this? Fame and substance are what even sages cannot overcome—how much less can you?

Nevertheless, if you must have a way, come and tell me."
Yan Hui said: "If I am upright yet empty, diligent yet single-minded, will that do?"
Confucius said: "Alas! How could it? When one is full of yang, boastful and ostentatious, with shifting colors, even ordinary people do not oppose it. Following others’ likes and dislikes to seek harmony in their hearts—this is called ‘daily gradual virtue that does not succeed,’ let alone great virtue! You would cling without transformation, outwardly comply while inwardly disdaining—how could that ever suffice?

Then let me be inwardly straight and outwardly yielding, achieving while aligning above. Being inwardly straight is to be a companion of Heaven. One who is a companion of Heaven knows that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven—why should one’s own words be esteemed while others’ are not, or be resented while others’ are? Such a one is called a child—this is what it means to be a companion of Heaven. Being outwardly yielding is to be a companion of others. Bowing, scraping, and humble service are the rites of a minister—everyone does this; how dare I not? Doing what others do, others will find no fault in it—this is what it means to be a companion of others. Achieving while aligning above is to be a companion of antiquity. Though one’s words may instruct, they are in fact admonitions. What antiquity had, I do not possess. Such a one, though upright, is not blamed—this is what it means to be a companion of antiquity. Would this do?"
Confucius said: "Alas! How could it?"

The Way is too rigidly upright, modeling itself on standards without adaptability—though steadfast, it remains blameless. Yet this is all it amounts to; how could it ever bring about transformation? It is still the way of one who follows their own mind.

Guo’s commentary: To act alone, sharing no desires with the people, is to drive the entire state into mortal peril, regarding them as mere weeds. With no refuge, the people are left adrift—this is why Yan Hui wished to go and save them. Confucius said that Hui’s Way was insufficient to rescue them, for like a hundred physicians attending a single illness, it would only breed confusion and fail to bring even one cure. Only when one possesses the proper capacity may one engage with the world.

If one forces their thoughts into perilous action, it shows that what resides within them is not yet settled. Virtue scatters and flows, knowledge spills forth uncontrollably—this is because of pride in reputation and competition for goodness. Even if a tyrant were utterly ruined, what he clings to and cherishes would still be nothing but fame and cunning. Fame arises, and contention follows; knowledge is employed, and strife erupts. Only by relinquishing fame and knowledge can one’s conduct be perfected.

Now, Hui’s virtue is sincere, but what he has yet to grasp is that the other does not comprehend it. Though he might wish to restrain him with benevolence and righteousness, the other would take it as an attempt to destroy him for personal gain and would surely turn against him. If one merely delights in the worthy and despises the foolish, hearing the Way and submitting, they are deemed an enlightened ruler. With an enlightened ruler, there will be no lack of worthy ministers—what is remarkable about your going? Moreover, it would only bring harm. You must remain silent and still; if you speak, he will surely exploit his sovereign’s authority to vie for victory, adorn his faults, dazzle your eyes, and calm your countenance. Before you can save yourself, you will abandon your own principles to follow him—not only failing to save him but furthering his evil.

In ancient times, Long Feng and Bi Gan, though subordinates, took on the burdens of their rulers and were thus cast aside by them. A violent ruler does not merely seek to indulge his desires; he also seeks fame, though not by the proper means. A ruler who cherishes fame and demands desire, even Yao or Yu could not transform him without resorting to force. How then do you intend to go empty-handed and transform him?

Hui said: "If I rectify my form, empty my heart, speak with humility and without contradiction—would this suffice?"
Confucius said: "Alas! How could it? The ruler of Wei is of a haughty and overbearing nature, brimming within and flaunting without. When others provoke him, he responds with scorn and humiliation to satisfy his extravagant heart. He is obstinate and unyielding—how could this ever do?"

Hui then proposed three further approaches: "Inwardly upright, one is a companion of Heaven; outwardly yielding, one is a companion of others; achieving while aligning above, one is a companion of antiquity."
Confucius still deemed this insufficient, for his governance and affairs were not yet in harmony. Though not grandly expansive, it might avoid blame, yet it would not bring transformation. This was because he carried these three methods with him, still unable to be without mind.

Lü’s commentary: In his prime, he acted recklessly with his state. Acting alone, he treated the people’s lives as trifles. The people died for the state, and if the state’s affairs demanded death, then the recompense should be profound—yet it was diminished and measured as if bestowing dew upon reeds! Such extreme parsimony is why the people had no recourse.

Yan Hui wished to humble himself to uphold the Way, but the Master did not permit it, detesting the杂多 of such an approach, which would only disturb without saving. First establish it within yourself, and then you may establish it in others—there is nowhere this will not suffice. Now, what resides within Hui is not yet settled; how can he attend to the conduct of a violent man?

Virtue scattered and knowledge unrestrained are the instruments of contention. Moreover, when virtue is profound and trust is firm, it suffices to reach others’ qi and prevent them from descending into baseness and betrayal. When fame and rank are not contested, it suffices to reach others’ hearts and prevent them from falling into suspicion and jealousy—only then may one speak with them.

Hui has not yet reached this point, yet he would forcefully employ the measured words of benevolence and righteousness to enlighten a violent man before him. This is to possess beauty while inciting others’ hatred. He is merely fond of fame—so contend with him through fame. He is merely fond of cunning—so deploy cunning against him, leading him to wield the tools of destruction. This is to lead him by the head. Observe what he puts forth, and you will know what he will turn to—Hui’s going would be nothing but peril.

If a ruler delights in the worthy and despises the unworthy, then he is the same as you—why seek to be different? If you speak with him, merely agreeing without instruction, he will surely exploit others to vie in clever debate, his demeanor harsh and his gaze piercing, his heart already set. Before you can seek escape or compliance, it will be too late. This is like using water to extinguish water or fire to extinguish fire—submission will only perpetuate the beginning without end.

He does not expect sincerity and generosity from me, yet if I speak with him, I will surely die before the violent man. In ancient times, Long Feng and Bi Gan cultivated themselves and served the people, yet were suspected of hoarding favor—thus their rulers cast them aside. They, too, were merely fond of fame. Even Yao and Yu could not transform the rebellious states without resorting to their destruction. If fame and reality are what the sage cannot overcome, how much less can one like you?

To be upright yet empty is not true emptiness. To strive for unity is not true unity. Pride swells within and manifests without; when others provoke him, he seeks to gratify his heart. Even minor virtue is not achieved—how much less great virtue? Using this to correct his ruler would at best result in outward compliance while inwardly remaining unchanged—how could it transform him?

To take one’s own words and judge others’ goodness or badness is to regard oneself as base and others as noble. From the perspective of the Way, the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven—what distinction is there between them? To be a companion of Heaven, of others, and of antiquity—Hui believed that with these three he might adapt to change and perhaps succeed. Yet in responding to things, if one has not attained oneness and emptiness of mind, this is why it is called "too much."

Outwardly lodging uprightness in antiquity is to govern others by standards, not by the person, and to alter what one knows—this is not true deliberation. Deliberation is to subtly discern others’ intentions and grasp them—then it is firm. Though blameless, how could it bring transformation? It is because one follows their own mind and has not yet attained mindlessness.

The worthy in relation to a state are like physicians treating illness: when a state is well-governed, the worthy have no role to play and depart; when a state is in chaos and ungoverned, the worthy bear their surplus of virtue to attend it. Those with illness flock to the physician’s gate; those with a state seek worthy scholars. Wishing to apply what I have heard from the Master’s teachings, I contemplate their principles and act accordingly—might this perhaps bring healing to Wei’s afflictions?

Confucius deemed Wei’s shallowness insufficient for transformation. The sage embraces oneness as the model for the world, so those entangled in multiplicity are right to despair of remedy. First establish it in oneself, and what lies in others becomes self-evident without words. If what is established in oneself remains unsettled, how can one attend to the domain of the violent and practice the Way there?

Virtue, once it acquires a name, becomes dissipated; knowledge, once it engenders contention, emerges—both are inauspicious instruments that cannot be fully enacted in the world. Cultivate qi to the point of fullness, and only then can one penetrate others’ qi; cultivate the mind to the point of stillness, and only then can one penetrate others’ minds. Without attaining this, merely applying the rigid standards of moral discourse before the violent will surely provoke their hatred of one’s excellence and bring harm upon oneself.

Moreover, if the lord of Wei delights in the worthy and detests the unworthy, why would he seek you only to set himself apart from others? You should remain silent—if you speak, he will exploit his lordly authority to engage in verbal sparring, while your countenance and form reveal your thoughts outwardly, and your heart conforms inwardly. Once you begin to comply, there will be no end to it. If you do not heed my earnest words, you will surely die before the violent.

In ancient times, Guan Longfeng and Bi Gan cultivated themselves to aid their people, yet their lords ensnared and destroyed them—this was the fault of their love of reputation. The three states of Congji, Xu’ao, and Youhu attacked one another in pursuit of fame and substance; even Yao and Yu could not transform them and had to raise armies to punish them, leaving their states desolate and their persons executed before ceasing. From this, we know that those who seek fame and substance cannot escape calamity.

Yan Hui proposed aligning with emptiness and striving for oneness. The Master said that the lord of Wei was full of yang but hollow in response to others’ influences—minor virtue could not succeed, let alone great virtue. Yan Hui then presented three principles: being a companion to others, to Heaven, and to antiquity, hoping thus to avoid the exhaustion of the age. The Master again did not approve.

Excessive governance by laws without true deliberation—deliberation here means private scrutiny, a kind of covert scheming. Though firm, it remains blameless, yet it still involves distinctions between inner and outer, past and present, which is why it cannot escape the exhaustion of the age. From the perspective of one who commands the transformations of things, how could there be any difference between Heaven, humanity, and antiquity? Only the mindless can partake in this.

*Detailed Daoist Annotation:*
The perfected in relation to the world never engage in thought yet suffice to please the hearts of those who think; they never act yet suffice to refine the reflections of those who act. How is this so? They respond only after being moved, act only under compulsion—how could they toil busily over the world’s affairs?

Yan Hui knew of thought and action for ordering the age but did not understand thoughtlessness and inaction for responding to things. Seeking to correct the lord of Wei’s tyrannical excesses and rescue the people from dire straits, Confucius thus rebuked his meddlesome disturbance.

The perfected first establish it in themselves—this is embracing oneness. Then they establish it in others—this is being a model for the world. If what is established in oneself remains unsettled, it becomes fragmented; acting in the domain of the violent, it becomes disorderly.

Virtue is the substance of reputation; when reputation prevails, virtue dissipates. Knowledge is the instrument of contention; when contention arises, knowledge emerges. One whose virtue is profound and trust is unshakable is inwardly steadfast; one who has not penetrated others’ qi remains outwardly uncontentious in reputation. Without penetrating others’ minds, to forcibly expound the rigid standards of benevolence and righteousness before the violent is to speak deeply where acquaintance is shallow—it only invites their enmity.

From “delighting in the worthy and detesting the unworthy” to “surely die before the violent” speaks of the exhaustion brought by knowledge. From “Jie killed Guan Longfeng” to “what the sage cannot overcome” speaks of the exhaustion brought by reputation.

Aligning with emptiness and striving for oneness is to be full of yang. Being full of yang means one’s substance is inherently self-enclosed. Yan Hui’s initial impulse was to employ knowledge to save the age; when he realized its impossibility, he sought to withdraw knowledge and return to emptiness and oneness. Finding this also impossible, he then aimed to unify emptiness and oneness with the three companionships.

Thus, being a companion to Heaven means advancing one’s own integrity without assessing others’ goodness or badness; being a companion to others means acting as they do without offending their flaws; being a companion to antiquity means citing the ancients to criticize the present without being resented. Aligning with emptiness and striving for oneness is mere obstinacy, insufficient to speak of virtue—calling it untransformative means not understanding adaptability. The three companionships amount to mere scrutiny, insufficient to speak of governance. How can one who has not attained transformation transform others?

*Blue Void Annotation:*
To lightly use one’s state is to fail to value oneself; to lightly use the people’s lives is to fail to value others. The dead are beyond counting, so the state is used as a measure. The plantain is a hollow grass—though the lord of Wei may possess virtuous blessings like the plantain’s unreality, the people have nowhere to turn.

Yan Hui said that many illnesses gather at the physician’s gate and wished to contemplate how to save them. The Way does not tolerate杂乱; multiplicity breeds confusion. First establish it in oneself to set the root—if the root is not set, how can one transform others?

Those who lose virtue do so for reputation; those who employ knowledge do so for contention. What people cannot know is the great name; what people do not contend over is the great knowledge. Not knowing, not contending—this is how one fully enacts the Way. Yet to forcibly expound the rigid standards of benevolence and righteousness before the violent is to make others hate one’s excellence, as if courting destruction. To honor the worthy and distance the sycophantic is to be enlightened—why seek further distinction?

Should they seize the advantage to vie in cunning debate, your eyes will flicker in outward alarm, your complexion smooth in inward restraint; your mouth will falter between assent and dissent, your bearing crumble into disarray. Once the heart yields, all steadfastness is lost, and compliance at the outset leaves no end to submission.

Thus you risk disbelieving earnest counsel and perishing before the violent. He then cited Long Feng and Bi Gan as proof: where the Way is absent, the distinction between defiance and compliance becomes stark; where the Way prevails, the very principle of defiance and compliance is forgotten.

In former times, even Yao and Yu could not transform the Three States and resorted to conquest to destroy them. How then could you, Yan Hui, hope to transform the Lord of Wei with mere words? Such an attempt would be not merely futile. If your resolve is not yet emptied, if your effort is not yet unified—if arrogance swells without and none dare oppose you—how can you, whose nature cannot be altered, empty and unify yourself to transform others?

Yan Hui then proposed aligning with Heaven, with humanity, and with antiquity as a means to avoid calamity, but the Master did not permit it, for he still harbored the intent of a teacher and had not yet embodied the vast, obscure Dao.

Zhao’s commentary: The dead are measured by the marsh; corpses pile high in the wetlands, as if the marsh were their measure. Like plantains, the people are mown down like grass.

Yan Hui wished to go and save them, but the Master sighed, saying, "You will surely suffer punishment." To persuade others while fearing they will not comply is to multiply your arguments. To insist they must follow is to introduce disorder. From disorder comes anxiety; from anxiety comes inability even to save oneself—how then can one save others?

Your heart’s resolve is not yet settled; how can you lightly venture before the violent? When reputation is established, virtue is lost; when contention arises, knowledge is born. If remonstrance is heeded, faults are attributed to the ruler, while merit is claimed by the minister. Thus reputation clashes and knowledge sparks contention—this is not how one fully enacts the Way.

Though your virtue is profound and your integrity sincere, your qi and spirit have not yet attained penetration. To flaunt your own rectitude and provoke others’ faults is to invite their hatred—this is what people call courting disaster, and you will only bring ruin upon yourself. If they possessed a heart that delights in the worthy and despises the unworthy, they would seek you out without pause—why wait for you to go to them?

If you remain silent, so be it; but should you speak, they will press their arguments to seek victory. In that moment, your eyes will blur and dare not meet theirs; your countenance will soften and dare not resist. Your mouth will scramble to explain, your demeanor will cringe and comply, your heart will yield to their desires. Thus you will not only fail to help but will make matters worse! Only by accommodating their will can you avoid being cornered.

Long Feng and Bi Gan were slain for their loyalty—this is to be denied one’s reputation. Cong Ji, Xu Ao, and You Hu waged war and contended, only to be attacked by Yao and Yu—this is to be denied one’s substance. If even sages cannot prevail against reputation and substance, how can you hope to correct the Lord of Wei?

If you must go, you must have a way—try explaining it to me. Yan Hui replied with "emptiness and resolve, effort and unity," but the Master deemed it impossible. The Lord of Wei is haughty, self-indulgent, and steeped in flattery from dawn to dusk—how much less would he heed sudden attempts to correct him? Once he clings to his ways without change, you will outwardly comply while inwardly daring no dissent—this is even more unacceptable!

Yan Hui then revised his approach, proposing alignment with Heaven, humanity, and antiquity, but the Master again refused, saying the Lord of Wei’s misgovernance is too severe—how can antiquity serve as a comparison? Though he may not punish you for it, your methods end there—how can they effect transformation? His conduct aligns with those who are self-righteous; how could he follow antiquity?

Yongzhai remarked: I have heard that when the state has the Way, one appears; when it lacks the Way, one withdraws. Zhuangzi reverses this, saying one departs from well-ordered states and approaches disordered ones—like a physician whose skills are needed only when illness abounds at the gate. What use is one in a state already well-governed?

You wish to convey what you have learned from the Master to the Lord of Wei, hoping to stabilize his state, but the Master deemed it inadvisable. From disorder to anxiety—how can one torment oneself and still save others? First establish it in yourself. The moment you seek reputation, your natural virtue is already lost, and private knowledge gives rise to contention.

Reputation and knowledge are the world’s most perilous affairs; they cannot be fully enacted. Thus, though your virtue is profound and your integrity sincere, if you have not yet grasped others’ nature and qi and forcibly present the standards of benevolence and righteousness before the wicked, disaster will befall you.

Having not been summoned, you go of your own accord. With the nobility of a lord, they will seize your words to vie for victory. Overwhelmed, your eyes will blur, your complexion will humble itself to appease them, your mouth will scramble to explain, your form will cringe and submit, your heart will yield to their desires. Compliance thus pursued knows no end!

Long Feng and Bi Gan were killed for their loyalty—this was the fault of seeking reputation. Yao and Yu attacked the Three States, for those who sought reputation and self-interest were unbearable even to them—how much less can you, seeking reputation, remonstrate with the Lord of Wei?

Yan Hui said, "If I embody emptiness, resolve, effort, and unity, perhaps I can go and transform him," but the Master deemed it utterly impossible. The Lord of Wei’s yang qi is overflowing; if you attempt to move him with words, he will suppress your heart to gratify his own. If you cling without yielding, outwardly seeking harmony through emptiness while inwardly maintaining effort and unity—can you truly believe this will suffice?

Yan Hui then proposed three conditions that might persuade the Lord of Wei, but the Master again refused, saying your criticisms of governance are too numerous and will never bring peace. Even if you master these three, you will incur no blame, but this only spares you—how can it transform others? Your three proposals all stem from the intent of a teacher; the moment you harbor such intent, you depart from the natural Way.

The general meaning of the various explanations has been thoroughly addressed; no further repetition is needed here. As for the interpretation of certain characters, some discussions may have been overlooked, and presumptuous annotations have been appended at the end. For instance, the phrase *ze ruo jiao* (泽若蕉) is rather difficult to explicate. Some separate *ze* into its own clause, leaving the following two characters incomplete. The character *ze* (泽) has two possible meanings. As for *jiao* (蕉), interpretations vary; older annotations on pronunciation and meaning take *ze* as "wilderness" and *jiao* as equivalent to *qiao* (樵, "firewood"), which does make sense.

"To measure the dead by the state" is akin to the historical records of measuring grain by cattle and horses—it signifies their vast, uncountable number. With so many people dead, the grain, millet, grasses, and trees cannot flourish, and the marshes appear as if stripped bare by firewood gatherers; the governance of the state may thus be discerned.

To forcibly expound upon benevolence and righteousness, as if applying a carpenter’s inked line, before a violent ruler is to impose upon others what they despise as beautiful. The character *yan* (衍) appears uniformly in all versions, except in the *Bixu Zhaojiangnan Guzang* edition, which writes it as *jie* (街). Later in the text, following Master Cui’s edition, it appears as *e yu qi mei* (恶育其美), where *yu* (育) means "to sell," linking it to the sense of *xuan* (衒, "to flaunt") in the preceding text. Yet this ultimately fails to align with the purport of the classic.

Upon consulting the *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on Music*, one finds: "Those who recognize the patterns of ritual and music possess the arts of governance," and further: "The brilliance of the expounder." Here, *shu* (术) is interchangeable with *mi* (迷, "to delude"), preserving an ancient usage.

This chapter mentions the "violent ruler" thrice. Most interpretations take it to mean "tyrannical and brutal," yet upon careful examination, the first two instances should be rendered as "to manifest violence," meaning to display the ruler’s violent methods before others—this reading flows smoothly and aligns with the preceding and following text. The final instance directly refers to the brutality of the man in question, namely Kuai Kui.

*South China Zhenjing Yihai Muzhai*, Scroll Seven, concludes. #1 The character *zi* (子) appears as *hui* (回) in all editions.

**Chapter Two: Among the Human World**
Yan Hui said: "I have no further means to advance. May I ask for the method?"
Zhongni replied: "Fast. I shall tell you of it. Do you think it easy to act while maintaining this? Those who deem it easy act against Heaven’s fitting order."
Yan Hui said: "My family is poor. For months now, I have neither drunk wine nor eaten meat. Would this suffice as fasting?"
He replied: "This is the fasting of sacrificial rites, not the fasting of the mind."
Hui said: "May I ask about the fasting of the mind?"
Zhongni said: "Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind. Do not listen with the mind but listen with qi. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at signs. Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind."
Yan Hui said: "Before I received this teaching, I was truly myself. Having received it, I have never been myself. Can this be called emptiness?"
The Master said: "It is complete! I shall tell you. If you can enter and wander within its bounds without being moved by its name, then enter and sing; if not, then stop. Without gate, without harm—abide in one dwelling and lodge in inevitability, and you will be close. To sever ties is easy; to walk without touching the ground is difficult. To be employed by others is easy to feign; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to feign. I have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings. I have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge. Look upon that emptiness: an empty chamber generates brightness, and auspiciousness comes to rest. If one does not come to rest, this is called sitting in motion. To follow the ears and eyes, inwardly connecting yet outwardly detached from the mind’s knowing—even ghosts and spirits will come to dwell, let alone men! This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the ultimate course of Fuxi and Jiqu, and how much more so for those who are scattered!"

Guo Xiang’s commentary:
Those who act with intention find it truly difficult; to regard acting with intention as easy is to fail to see its fittingness. "Unify your will" means to discard heterodox paths and follow the singular. Abandon the ears and eyes, forget the mind’s intentions, and align with the self-attainment of qi and nature—this is emptiness awaiting things. Before attaining the fasting of the mind, one possesses a self; having attained it, one no longer possesses a self. Releasing the mind into the realm of self-attainment, stopping at the actual—this is like the notes of a melody responding without intention, hence the term "singing." Let things be as they are—this is "without gate." Entrusting the world to its natural peace—this is "without harm." Inevitability is the necessity of principle. To embody the dwelling of utmost oneness and meet the tally of necessity is to exhaust principle. To desire not to act is easy; to act without treading upon the ground is impossible. To be without action is easy; to act without harming nature is impossible. What is obtained through seeing and hearing is coarse, hence easily deceived; the recompense of nature is subtle, hence difficult to act upon. Those who lose little of the real lose little of wholeness; those who lose much of the real lose much of wholeness. The recompense of loss and gain accords with one’s portion, and to defy Heaven with artifice—is this not difficult? The analogy of wings and knowledge speaks of the necessity of possessing the means to accomplish a task. Without the dwelling of utmost emptiness, there is no way to achieve the reality of transforming things. To regard being as non-being is the empty chamber. When the chamber is empty, pure brightness arises, and auspiciousness gathers there. If one does not stop at what is fitting and does not meet the ultimate, this is like sitting in stillness while the mind gallops without cease—external enemies have not arrived, yet one is already inwardly exhausted. How can one transform things? To close the ears and eyes and naturally attain—this is to externalize the mind’s knowing! Thus, to follow one’s nature directly and penetrate all without obstruction—even the hidden and obscure cannot bind one, let alone the burdens of the human world. Among things, there is none, noble or base, that does not connect itself through the mind’s knowing and the ears and eyes. Therefore, what the world calls knowledge and perception—does one know because one desires to know, see because one desires to see? People of the world act with desire to know and see, driving the spirit within and losing the ears and eyes without. Thus, they are ill at ease in their bodies and out of harmony with things."

Lü’s commentary:
Zhongni told Yan Hui that in matters of action, to act is never easy without difficulty. The fasting of the mind is to be without thought or action and return to the mindless state—without unifying the will, this cannot be conveyed. "Do not listen with the ears but with the mind" means listening without hearing. "Do not listen with the mind but with qi" means the mind is without knowing. Listening without hearing stops at the ears; the mind without knowing stops at signs. Emptiness awaiting things is only qi. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness—this is how one returns to the mindless state. In regard to the mind, one has never attained what can employ it, hence one cannot be without self. Thus, before Hui attained the fasting of the mind, he truly possessed a self; having attained it, he could be without self. "Without being moved by its name" means forgetting its emptiness. "Entering and wandering within its bounds" means the mind’s emergence is shaped by things. "Enter and sing; if not, then stop"—like metal and stone, which sound only when struck. When it stops, there is no gate through which the many movements can disturb, no harm through which the various evils can afflict. Abiding in one dwelling and lodging in inevitability to act—with this, one may traverse the human world and be close.

The Master further instructed that to cease advancement is easy, but to tread no ground is difficult. To tread no ground, nothing surpasses erasing all traces; to escape the burdens of things, nothing surpasses forgetting the self. Yet forgetting the self without authenticity is merely to fall into pretense.

Man possesses knowledge and thus has what he does not know, so serving man is easily feigned. Heaven is without knowledge yet knows all, so serving Heaven is difficult to counterfeit. Preserving the mind with which I serve Heaven—this is serving Heaven; how could pretense be permitted?

Man’s knowledge serves as wings; clip those wings, and he halts, no longer able to fly. Behold that empty chamber—when the room is void, brightness arises, and auspicious signs appear, resting where they rest. Yet not to rest in this is called "sitting in motion," whence arise good and ill fortune, regret and shame, all born of movement.

When one attains true stillness, the ears become like eyes, the eyes like ears; the mind congeals, the form dissolves, and flesh and bone fuse as one. The eyes turn inward, transcending the mind’s knowing; then spirits and gods will come to dwell—how much more so men? This is the transformation of the myriad things, the ultimate practice of the ancient sages.

*Dú’s Annotation*: Fasting of the mind values emptiness of heart. If the heart still harbors something, then attaining fasting is difficult. Those who treat fasting as easy and neglect it are unfit for the vastness of Heaven.

To listen with the ears is proper hearing; to listen with the mind is reverse hearing; to listen with qi is no hearing. Proper hearing with the ears aims to exhaust principle; reverse hearing with spirit aims to fulfill one’s nature; no hearing with emptiness aims to reach destiny.

Listening that stops at the ears is inferior to stopping at the mind. The mind makes distinctions, but when tallying signs, division yields to unity. When intention reaches qi, there is nothing left to hear—only emptiness awaiting things. The Dao gathers here; this is the wondrous function of the fasting of the mind.

*Liezi* states: The body harmonizes with the mind, the mind with qi, qi with spirit—this meaning is the same.

When Yan Hui awakened, he said, "Hui has not yet attained." Zhongni taught him the fasting of the mind. Before attaining it, Hui truly possessed a self; having attained it, he was without self. The Master further told him: Though you have reached emptiness, if you enter the realm of action, you must remain unmoved by names.

The mind is like a flute: empty, awaiting qi. When qi enters, it sounds; when it does not, it stops—where is there room for the mind in between? Entrusting the egress and ingress of the myriad things, it is without gate; consigning the world’s self-governance, it is without harm. Embracing the One and abiding in it, one rises only when compelled to respond to things, lodging their principle in them without claiming possession—this is perfection.

To exhaust the principle of nature and destiny while acting—such action is none other than Heaven’s. Serving man is easily feigned; serving Heaven makes pretense difficult. Wings for flight, knowledge for knowing—this illustrates that Yan Hui must possess a dwelling of utmost emptiness to transform things.

Gazing upon that prior realm, utterly void and clear—this is an analogy for the mind. When brightness arises, the Dao gathers—this is called nature. When spirit abides in stillness, auspicious signs come to rest. Those who cannot rest sit in form while their spirit races.

Those who attain stillness need not have ears and eyes fixed outward; mind and will need not be confined within. Thus, though there may be thought and action, there is no worldly entanglement. Spirits and gods will come to dwell—how much more so men?

*Detailed Daoist Annotation*: Acting from having is what the ancients found difficult. Where there is thought, there must be fasting; where there is action, there must be vigilance. Thus, those who would make their virtue spiritually luminous must fast the mind—this is why Zhongni instructed Yan Hui.

*Wenzi* says: The highest learning listens with spirit, the middle with the mind, the lowest with the ears. Listening that stops at the ears is limited to what the ears can hear; listening that stops at tallying signs is limited to what the mind can unite. Listening with qi is boundless, vast and free-flowing—thus it employs form without being employed by form, awaits things without being awaited by things. Empty yet unobstructed, responsive yet not retaining, this is how single-mindedness preserves qi, preserving qi attains emptiness, attaining emptiness gathers the Dao—this is the meaning of the fasting of the mind.

Before Hui attained the fasting of the mind, he still sighed as if possessing a self; having attained it, he was without self. Thus, he could enter its bounds without being moved by its name—when entering, it sounds; when not, it stops. Without gate, without harm, he drew action back to non-action. Dwelling in one abode and lodging in inevitability, he extended non-action to lodge in action.

Heaven not treading earth is easy; treading without touching the ground is difficult. Non-action is easy; engaging the world without transgression is difficult. Doing what men do is serving man, hence easily feigned; doing what Heaven does is serving Heaven, hence difficult to counterfeit.

Without wings, the bird cannot fly; without knowledge, man cannot know. Without emptiness, the room cannot generate brightness—how could auspicious signs come to rest? If one does not rest, even in silent seclusion among mountains and forests, one is still "sitting in motion."

When ears and eyes turn inward, there is no hearing, no seeing; transcending the mind’s knowing, there is no thought, no knowledge. Thus, emptiness reaches its extreme, stillness its sincerity—spirits and gods come to unite, how much more so men? This is how one commands the transformation of the myriad things without being transformed by them—the lifelong practice of the ancient sages.

*Bìxū’s Annotation*: Ritual fasting involves advancement; the fasting of the mind awakens to the root. Not listening with the ears but with the mind is to abandon illumination and observe the wondrous. Not listening with the mind but with qi is to merge into the vast and boundless. Beginners reach this point scattered and difficult to gather, yet there is a wondrous gateway: when listening stops at the ears, spirit concentrates on its charge, inner vision does not stray, and outer dust does not enter.

When the mind rests upon the tally, auspicious light congeals and coalesces, and the numinous palace becomes profoundly clear while the heart’s sovereign attains stillness. Thus, the primal qi pervades emptiness, fundamentally requiring nothing, yet within this non-dependence, numinous beings gather of themselves—just as the *jiaoli* and fire-peach do not grow in thorny thickets. This principle is known only to those who cultivate and practice.

The attainment of efficacy lies in the subtle application of the fasting of the mind. In truth, it is the turning back of the self; one has not yet emptied the heart. When there has never been a turning back, even emptiness is forgotten. If one can enter the domain of laws and decrees, remaining unmoved and unassuming amidst things, one may nearly escape entanglement. *Entering* means to listen and receive; *wu* means speech without artifice. When listened to, one speaks; when not listened to, one ceases. Expansive words are called "no gate"; the flavor of principle is called "no harm." For one whose heart is undivided, dwelling in the unavoidable and entrusting merit to the forest of beings—halting progress is easy, but walking without touching the ground is difficult. This illustrates how others are easily deceived, while the self is hard to delude. With wings, one may soar through the gorges to the heavens; with the Dao, one may respond to change. When the chamber is empty, yang brightness arises; when the heart is settled, celestial radiance emerges. To sit idly in a hall while harboring likes and dislikes is like a horse tethered in its stall yet galloping a thousand miles in intent.

Not resisting the six senses externally allows one to inwardly gather the numinous light, leaving no room for worldly affairs to stain or defile.

*Zhao’s Annotation*: When listening stops at the ears and the mind rests upon the tally, one attains perfect stillness. Qi is emptiness awaiting things, responding and thus penetrating. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness; emptiness is where all principles converge—this is called the fasting of the mind. Yanzi suddenly realized: "When I cannot move as I wish, there is an ‘I’; when I can move as I wish, there is no ‘I.’" The Master praised his attainment of perfection and further instructed him: "You may enter their domain without being swayed by fame. When in accord, speak; when not, cease." *No gate* means I have no crevice for others to exploit; *no harm* means they do not perceive me as a threat. Dwelling in the unavoidable, one may nearly succeed. Halting progress is easy; walking without touching the ground is difficult—this too embodies the meaning of the unavoidable. Being used by others involves intention, hence is easily feigned; being used by Heaven follows principle, hence is hard to counterfeit. Flying without wings or knowing without knowledge is to be swift without haste, to arrive without traveling.

*Que* refers to the nature of emptiness. An empty chamber generates brightness; a vast space radiates light. When auspiciousness comes to rest, neither misfortune nor fortune arrives. If one harbors a mind seeking blessings, this is called "sitting while galloping." Following the ears and eyes inwardly unites them with clarity; transcending the mind’s knowledge unites them with emptiness. Thus, one may join the company of spirits and gods—who among men would not believe it?

*Yong Qi* said: "If you rely on your cunning to act, the moment this intention arises, Heaven’s will is displeased." First, focus the will to keep it untainted. Listening with the ears remains external; listening with the mind still involves an "I"; listening with qi leaves no thing. When listening stops at the ears, it does not enter the heart; when the mind rests upon the tally, it aligns with things, creating a division between self and other. Emptiness is where the Dao resides; only the Dao gathers in emptiness—this single word *emptiness* is the fasting of the mind. Before receiving instruction, Yanzi still had an "I"; after receiving instruction, there had never been an "I"—forgetting the self is emptiness. The Master further warned that the human world is like a cage: you may enter and move within it without being swayed by fame. *Entering* means to *wu*—when one may speak, speak; when one may not, cease. Without fixed direction, there is no gate; without scent or taste, there is no harm—these are metaphors for a mind without intention or striving. Taking unity as one’s dwelling and lodging the heart in the unavoidable, one fulfills the Way of the human world. Halting progress without moving is easy; walking without touching the ground is difficult. Being enslaved by human desires makes deception easy; only by darkening the mind and following the Creator’s decree can one leave

The term *mou* (谋) has been debated, with Xia’s interpretation of it as "planning" deemed inadequate. Yongzhai’s gloss of it as "reckless action" comes closer. Now, to clarify: "listening with the ears" halts at hearing the Dao without fully practicing it; "listening with the heart" halts at aligning with the Dao without fully forgetting it. But when one listens with *qi*, there is nothing unheard, nothing unaligned—roaming boundlessly, merging with the Great Void. Where is the Great Void not present? Thus, one awaits things with perfect receptivity, and nothing escapes. What the ears obscure, the heart clarifies; what the heart aligns with is *qi*, which, in stillness and non-action, empties itself to receive all things—this is what Mencius called "the vast and overflowing *qi* that fills all between heaven and earth." Observe how it is never filled when poured, never exhausted when drawn, ever-increasing when given, ever-responsive yet ever-still—what need has it for waiting or not waiting?

All under heaven is pervaded by a single *qi*, shared by all beings and the Great Void. Only emptiness and *qi* are neither identical nor separate, mutually revealing essence and function, thus nowhere obstructed. The Dao, however, is neither emptiness nor *qi*, yet can be both—transforming the rigid under heaven, governing the solid, awaiting things without awaiting, responding perfectly without exhaustion. The marvel of "fasting of the heart" lies in emptiness alone. Thus, it can still all actions, illuminate all things, like a mirror unveiled, like a scale suspended—nothing escapes its measure of weight or beauty, yet it bears no burden of favor or resentment, giving or taking. In this way, one dwells in the human world as if at play.

Yanzi suddenly realized: "Before grasping the function of 'fasting of the heart,' I truly had an 'I'; once grasping it, there has never been an 'I'—how swift is the transformation!" The Master often praised him for appearing foolish in his unceasing compliance, which was the true proof of having never had an "I." When Yanzi was about to depart for Wei, the Master instructed him thus: the daily transmission of inner learning concerns the subtleties of nature and destiny, truly for cultivating the self. Now, as he was to engage in governance and assist the Way, the Master detailed the intricacies of ruler-minister relations and worldly affairs, harmonizing form and *qi*, emptying within and manifesting without—above, to attain the marvelous function of "fasting of the heart," below, to reveal the true mechanism of transformation. This is how the sage follows heaven as his companion without entanglement in the affairs of the human world.

When Duke Ye’s son Gao was sent as an envoy to Qi, he asked Confucius: "The king has entrusted me with great responsibility. Qi treats its envoys with utmost respect but little urgency. Even a common man cannot be swayed—how much less a lord! I tremble with fear." You once told me: "In all matters, great or small, few succeed without some discord. If a matter fails, one faces human-inflicted harm; if it succeeds, one faces harm from the imbalance of yin and yang. Only those of virtue can achieve success or failure without harm. I eat coarse food without craving refinement, and my cook has no desire for coolness. Yet this morning I received my orders, and by evening I am drinking ice—is this not inner heat? I have not yet encountered the reality of the matter, yet I already suffer from yin-yang imbalance. If the matter fails, I will surely face human-inflicted harm. Facing both possibilities, a minister is unfit for the task. Please instruct me further!"

Confucius replied: "There are two great precepts under heaven: one is destiny, the other is righteousness. Your love for your parents is destiny—inescapable in the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is righteousness—there is no place under heaven where it does not apply, nowhere to flee. These are the great precepts. Thus, in serving one’s parents, one finds peace regardless of circumstance—this is the height of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, one finds peace regardless of the task—this is the height of loyalty. In serving one’s own heart, joy remains unchanged before all things, knowing the inevitable and accepting it as destiny—this is the height of virtue. As a minister and son, one inevitably faces the unavoidable. Proceeding with the nature of affairs while forgetting the self, how can one have leisure to delight in life or fear death? You may go now.

Let me repeat what I have heard: In close dealings, trust must be mutual; in distant dealings, words must convey loyalty, and those words may be transmitted. Transmitting words that please or anger both sides is the most difficult task under heaven. Words that please both sides tend to be excessive in praise; words that anger both sides tend to be excessive in blame. All excess is falsehood, and falsehood cannot be trusted. Distrust brings calamity to the messenger. Thus, the *Fayan* says: 'Transmit the constant truth, not the excessive words—this is nearly perfect.' Guo’s commentary notes: 'In matters great or small, few succeed without some discord. Success brings harmony, failure brings anger—this is unavoidable even for the King of Chu.' If success removes human harm, one’s five viscera are already bound in ice and fire. Entrusting success or failure to others without distressing the heart—only those of virtue can do this.

Now, one who faces fire does not seek coolness, knowing the meagerness of one’s provisions. Yet drinking ice due to inner heat truly arises from anxiety over the difficulty of the task. Before the matter is resolved, one fears failure; if it indeed fails, fear congeals within, and the net of punishment ensnares without. The Master taught the great precepts of destiny and righteousness—naturally firm and unbreakable. If a lord could be fled or parents abandoned, they would not be precepts. Knowing the inevitable and accepting it as destiny, one is free from sorrow or joy—what change could there be?"

Thus, one remains profoundly serene, accepting all encounters as destiny, without interposing the heart between them. Even in serving ordinary people, one finds no situation unsuited—how much more so with lord and kin? Matters have their inevitable course; principle is ever-pervading. One must simply proceed as fate decrees.

If faith in the Dao is not steadfast, if delight and aversion linger in the heart, if one schemes for life and frets over death, success in affairs will never be seen. Words born of joy or anger often exceed the truth; those who transmit them should neither lose nor embellish the mean. Should the transmission err toward excess, it verges on falsehood. The receiver, harboring doubt, imputes fault to the messenger. Thus, one ought not convey momentary lapses in speech, but rather the enduring disposition, distilling its sincerity—this approaches wholeness.

Lu’s Annotation: External things cannot be made certain, yet in all affairs, great or small, success alone brings joy—this is insistence on certainty. Whether success or failure comes, the ebb and flow of human and cosmic forces remain—this is the way of war. Only those of virtue can transcend the self; transcending the self, they know no insistence; knowing no insistence, they know no ebb.

If, before action is taken, anxiety already kindles inner heat, then one has not yet grasped the true nature of the matter but has already succumbed to the ebb of yin and yang—so deeply is one unable to forget the self. Thus, Confucius taught that love for kin is destiny, and service to one’s lord is righteousness—neither can be untied from the heart. In serving parents, one does not choose between level or perilous ground; in serving one’s lord, one does not choose between ease or difficulty—one accepts all with equanimity. This is the height of loyalty and filial piety. Then, in tending the heart, how could sorrow or joy readily shift before one? If sorrow or joy shifts readily, it is because one makes choices and cannot accept what comes. One who can tend the heart will find all service to kin and lord equally at peace.

If one can truly accept without choosing, then one acts in accord with the nature of affairs, forgetting the self—how could there be leisure to delight in life and fear death?

Yi Du’s Annotation: All who seek to establish affairs rejoice in success and grieve over failure; thus, whether success or failure comes, none escape the ebb. Can one escape this ebb? Only those of virtue, perhaps.

Zigao himself confessed: "I eat coarse food, not refined, so when I cook, the fire does not burn long, and I do not seek coolness. Yet this morning, upon receiving my charge, by evening I drink ice—my inner heat is plain to see. Before even encountering the true nature of the matter, I cannot escape the ebb of yin and yang and human forces. As a minister, I am unworthy of this task—pray, instruct me."

Confucius taught the great precepts for minister and child: destiny lies with Heaven, righteousness with man. A child’s love for parents cannot be untied from the heart; a minister’s service to his lord admits no alternative but the lord. The heart is the true lord of man. If one seeks it within and serves it, one forgets even lord and kin, entrusting all to nature and remaining unmoved by sorrow or joy. In matters beyond one’s control, one acts in accord with the nature of affairs, forgetting the self—how could there be leisure to delight in life and fear death?

Confucius further taught the way of transmitting words: In close dealings with others, one may demand truth, so mutual trust prevails. At a distance, one cannot lose the transmission, so one conveys words with fidelity. Yet the most difficult words to transmit are those born of joy or anger, for praise or blame in excess resembles delusion and credulity. To err is to bring calamity upon the transmitter. Thus, convey the enduring disposition, not the excesses of speech—this is the way to preserve wholeness.

The *Bi Xu* commentary states: The hearth harbors no desire for clarity, for purity lies in the composed and indifferent. To drink ice for internal heat only exacerbates the afflictions of sorrow and vexation. To avoid the perils of yin-yang and the human Dao, one seeks instruction from Confucius.

Confucius teaches that father and son are joined by Heaven’s decree as *ming*, while ruler and minister are bound by the Dao as *yi*. Moreover, beneath the workings of creation, all are tied to ruler and kin—nowhere can one escape within Heaven and Earth. This is called the Great Precept. Thus, one does not select circumstances but abides in them; to choose is to fail in loyalty and filial piety.

For one who attends to the heart, sorrow and joy do not alter what lies before; only trust in the Dao and entrustment to *ming* remain. As ministers and children, there are indeed matters beyond one’s control. Shun’s potting and fishing, Yu’s governance of the waters—only by exhausting devotion and forgetting the self can one rest in *ming* and *yi*.

Mutual trust in proximity, fidelity in speech from afar—both are advances. Observing the path, one discerns their root. Transmitting words is like treading forward; the value lies in moderation. Excess or deficiency both err, and error brings calamity to the transmitter, for deviation from constancy incurs loss.

The *Zhao* commentary states: If plans for affairs fail, disgrace and humiliation follow—this is the decline of the human Dao. If plans succeed, joy and fear intermingle—this is the peril of yin-yang. My coarse and rough fare, my hearth’s silence without song—can this not be called frugality? Yet though no internal heat afflicts me, my breast already burns as if scorched. Before affairs succeed or fail, both perils converge upon me. What teaching can you offer?

Thus, he imparts the Great Precept of *ming* and *yi*, likening service to a ruler to service to kin. Having pledged oneself as a minister, how can one spare concern for the self? He further instructs on the way of transmission: fidelity and trust as the foundation, caution in transmitting words amid joy and anger—this is how wholeness is preserved.

*Yongzhai* says: If one schemes for the state and fails, punishment is certain—this is the decline of the human Dao. If one labors in calculation and succeeds, anxiety and thought breed illness—this is the peril of yin-yang. Since receiving my charge, I have eaten without savor, my breast seared with toil, yet before truly grasping affairs, this affliction has already taken hold. Should matters fail, punishment will follow—thus both perils are borne. What teaching can you offer?

Confucius instructed him in the two great precepts. *Precepts* are akin to laws. *Ming* is what one receives from Heaven. Serving kin is coeval with life itself, thus it cannot be sundered from the heart. *Yi* is what one ought to do—serving one’s lord is the foremost duty. In serving kin with utmost filiality, one follows their commands east or west, south or north, without choosing where to settle. With the heart devoted to loyalty, though sorrow and joy arise before one, it remains unaltered. For affairs may be easy or difficult, yet once the lord’s command is issued, it is what one must do—Heaven’s *ming* is the same, and there is nothing to be done but accept it. Should a minister or child encounter misfortune, one must simply perform the task at hand in truth—how could one then spare concern for the self?

Zigao, about to be sent on a mission to Qi, sought confirmation from Confucius regarding what he had heard in ordinary times, and also to dispel his own confusion—his heart torn between the anxiety of duty and the dread of peril, hoping for a remedy. Confucius taught him the two precepts of *ming* and *yi*: the great principles of loyalty and filiality—serving kin cannot be sundered from the heart, and serving one’s lord admits no escape under Heaven. In affairs of the heart, sorrow and joy find no purchase. Herein lies the essence of standing in the world. Yet the heart is the lord of Heaven, the source of all transformations; if one can serve the heart to the utmost, one’s conduct toward lord and kin may be known. To accept what cannot be helped is to know how one should conduct oneself in ordinary times. Firm in the Dao and clear in self-knowledge, what attachment or aversion could there be to life or death?

This is how one instructs all under Heaven who serve as ministers and children—to find peace in what is difficult to accept. The utmost of loyalty and filiality is the fulfillment of standing in the world. Confucius further expounded on the difficulty of transmitting words as an envoy, teaching him the way to preserve wholeness, so that the lord might not lose virtue and the minister might not disgrace his charge. This was a step below what he had revealed to Yan Hui. Only Yan Hui, who had mastered *ming* and exhausted the spiritual, could grasp Confucius’ discourse on the fasting of the mind and attain the ultimate state of sitting in forgetfulness. Zigao, however, still harbored concerns of gain and loss, advantage and harm, so Confucius merely instructed him to transmit commands with care and preserve the integrity of a minister. Herein lies the sage’s art of teaching according to capacity, guiding step by step with benevolence.

**Chapter Three: In the Human World**

Those who contend with skill and strength begin in brightness but invariably end in darkness; when excess prevails, deceit and cunning multiply. Those who drink wine with ritual propriety begin in order but invariably end in chaos; when excess prevails, strange pleasures abound. All affairs are thus: they commence in sincerity but conclude in vulgarity. What begins simply will inevitably grow vast. Words are like wind and waves; deeds are like gain and loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred, while gain and loss are easily imperiled. Thus, wrath arises without cause, and artful speech with biased words. When beasts are cornered, they do not choose their cries; their breath becomes ragged, and in that moment, a murderous intent takes hold. When scrutiny is too severe, a base heart responds in kind, though one remains unaware of it. If one does not know how this comes to be, how can one know where it will end?

As the *Fa Yan* states: Do not alter decrees, do not urge completion—excess only compounds the error. To alter decrees and urge completion at the outset is to court peril; what is beautifully accomplished endures, while what is badly done cannot be undone. How can one not be cautious?

Yet to ride things with the mind, entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection! Why act in expectation of reward? Nothing compares to delivering one’s mandate. This is the most difficult.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
Beginning in brightness and ending in darkness, the desire to prevail leads to excess, where harm arises and principle is abandoned. Beginning in order and ending in chaos, toasts follow sequence until drunkenness and debauchery know no bounds. Trouble arises from simplicity, and affairs emerge from the subtle—this is the principle of ultimate consequences. Words are like wind and waves; deeds bring gain or loss. When affairs attain their truth, peril may be stabilized and disorder settled. Wrath arises from artful words exceeding truth and biased speech missing the mark. Like a beast driven to desperation, its intent exhausted and breath disordered, it erupts in sudden fury, and both parties breed resentment in response. When scrutiny is too precise, vulgar and miserly thoughts arise unconsciously—how then can one know where fortune or misfortune will lead? To alter decrees and urge completion is to invite danger. What is beautifully accomplished follows the transformations of time, like planting—it cannot be rushed. To force completion of what one dislikes is to invite regret. Moreover, to lodge the mind in things and follow the inevitable course of principle is the fullness of the Mean, the ultimate in engaging the world. One should simply fulfill the reality of the mission—why interpose one’s own intentions? To deliver one’s mandate is easiest, yet to apply the mind with joy or anger makes it difficult.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
When the human heart is deep and still, words become wind and waves, easily stirred; when stilled, they rest in truth and peace. Deeds become gain or loss, easily imperiled. In such moments of ease and peril, one cannot but be cautious. To tend the heart and forget the self is to transcend the ebb and flow of yin and yang; to neither alter decrees nor urge completion is to transcend the ebb and flow of human affairs. When the heart emerges, it is shaped by things—this is riding things with the mind. Action arises from necessity; to entrust oneself to necessity is to nurture the center. Now, in being sent to Qi, nothing compares to delivering one’s mandate. To fulfill one’s duty is to remain unmoved by life or death, fortune or misfortune, and thus attain the truth of affairs. Why act in expectation of reward? Only to deliver one’s mandate with utter sincerity—this alone is difficult.

**Yi Du’s Commentary:**
Those who contend with skill and strength begin in joy and end in anger; those who drink wine with ritual begin in order and end in chaos. "Strange cunning" refers to deceit, and "strange pleasures" to unnatural delight. Affairs commence in trust and sincerity but conclude in coarseness and crudeness. What begins simply will inevitably grow vast—this is the constant way of human affairs.

The heart is likened to water, and words to wind and waves. Virtue is substance; conduct is ornament. Without conduct, virtue does not diminish; without ornament, substance is not lost. When the heart is already joyful, it is easily moved; when virtue is already lost, it is easily imperiled. The expression of anger and wrath arises from cunning words that lack substance, from biased speech that strays from reason—like being driven into a corner where silence is forced, where cries are uttered without regard for sound, where qi becomes pent-up and stagnant, and flaws and afflictions arise together. This illustrates that those who govern their hearts should release them into a state of non-action. To lead them onto the path of worry and distress is no different from driving a beast into a desperate corner.

To "restrain" is to reproach others too harshly; to "press" is to coerce them too severely. The unworthy heart responds in kind without even realizing it. For an emissary, altering decrees or urging their fulfillment are both perilous endeavors. True excellence matures over time—benevolence lies in its ripeness. If one urges the completion of what another detests, regret will soon follow. Can one not be cautious? Riding the myriad things to roam the heart, entrusting oneself to the supreme principle to nurture the center—what must be done arises from necessity. Following the "supervisor" as one’s guiding thread embodies the meaning of nurturing the center through necessity. This is perfection. Why then must one force action to repay the ruler’s virtue? Nothing compares to delivering one’s mandate without disgrace—this alone is difficult.

**Bixu’s Commentary:**
Cunning changes invite contention; excessive pleasure leads to chaos. Words like wind and waves are easily stirred, while conduct that loses substance is hard to stabilize. When a beast is cornered, it emits vicious sounds; when one reproaches others too deeply, harmony is lost—this is simply how principle operates, though none know why it must be so. Those who follow laws and decrees do not alter them; those who humbly cultivate themselves require no urging. Excellence matures over time—great vessels are late in completion. If what is forced to completion has no chance for correction, what is taken must also be given.

Riding things to roam the heart is to follow their nature; entrusting oneself to necessity is to empty the self. To act in repayment is false; to forget oneself is easy. The difficulty of delivering a ruler’s mandate lies neither in difficulty nor ease—only those who embody the Way can achieve it.

**Zhao’s Commentary:**
What begins in yang ends in yin; what begins in order ends in chaos—this is the inevitable principle. Water meets wind and waves arise; a beast nears death and roars—this too is the necessary course of events. A single word uttered can incite anger in others—is this not like wind and waves? Once angered, one acts upon it—is this not the loss of substance? Altering decrees and urging completion is excessive; to add to such matters is to court danger. What is beautifully completed arises from joy and endures, for its value lies in its duration. What is forced to completion begins without intent and cannot last.

When the heart is lodged in things, yet rests wholly in necessity without being moved, the way of nurturing the center reaches its pinnacle. Why anticipate difficulty and act in repayment? Nothing surpasses delivering one’s mandate with utter sincerity—this alone is difficult.

**Yongzhai’s Note:**
Yang is joy; yin is aversion. Excessive indulgence in amusement leads to the misuse of strange cunning. To invite others to drink with ritual: order marks the beginning of the feast, when all is measured and decorous; chaos comes when voices rise in clamor. When drinking exceeds propriety, pleasure becomes abnormal, and contention may arise. *Liang* means trust; *bi* means deceit. In human affairs, words give rise to wind and waves; conduct with traces of fame loses substance.

The expression of anger and wrath stems from cunning words and biased speech—like the cries of a dying beast, what choice is there in sound? When qi is pent-up in anger, cruelty and malice arise together. This is restraint and pressing, so the unworthy heart responds without knowing why. Here, the discussion returns to the emissary’s duty.

To "not alter decrees" is to convey their constant essence; to "not urge completion" is to let things unfold naturally. The moment one entertains excessive intentions, one seeks to add to matters, and plans become perilous. Excellence matures over time—human relationships reach perfection not in a day. A single misstep can turn good into ill, leaving no chance for correction. If one rides things to roam the heart, entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center’s uprightness, this is perfection. Why then act further to fulfill a mandate? One should simply deliver the ruler’s command with sincerity, without overthinking success or failure.

The Dharma of the transcendent is the Dharma of the worldly; to dwell in the world without entanglement is to transcend it. First, the difficulty of delivering a mandate is discussed, then the text broadly addresses the inevitable course of worldly affairs, where none know why things must unfold as they do—seeking only to understand their principle. The metaphors of wind and waves, of lost substance, are apt indeed.

"Restraint and pressing" are taken to extremes: *he* (pressing) is akin to *he* (investigation), though few commentaries elaborate. Only *Yi Du* separates them into two terms. Here, following the original meaning of *he*: it refers to the kernel where the vitality of fruit resides, where benevolence is contained. The ancients used it to illustrate the intent of the Seven Affections. To carve away at the kernel is to injure benevolence and extinguish vitality; to carve away at conduct is to injure righteousness and sever human bonds. Thus, the unworthy heart responds without intending to.

*Xiao* means "to resemble"—the Seven Hearts bestow likeness, treating all equally. If kindness and benevolence are absent, the heart loses its likeness—what evil would it not commit? Such outcomes are summoned by one’s own actions, and the mechanism cannot be ignored. The *Wenzhongzi*’s *Zhougong* chapter states: "Those who delight in the strange and revere the bizarre, unrestrained in their excess, will inevitably summon an unworthy heart in response." This saying originates here.

"Beautiful completion" and "forced completion" are opposing concepts. Some commentaries read *e* (forced) with a departing tone, but here it is interpreted with its original sound: the completion of beauty and goodness is most difficult, requiring long accumulation and transformation.

The completion of transgressions and evils is most effortless—once formed, even the desire to reform may come too late.

The preceding line warns against altering the state’s decrees and ordinances at will; the following line cautions against encouraging the arrogance of the Marquis of Qi. Ride the currents of things to roam the mind, act in accordance with principle, and do not preemptively weigh success or failure. When circumstances leave no choice, nurture the center; when principle reaches its limit, halt without losing the central Way. This is sufficient—why fabricate actions to repay one’s lord? Better to deliver one’s mandate: simply accept life and death, fortune and misfortune—what difficulty lies in this?

The Master first instructed on the great admonitions of fate and destiny, yet ultimately returned to the original intent. Observing this passage, it exhaustively captures the nature of things—who would claim the *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi] scorns the world beyond and neglects worldly affairs?

Yan He was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei. He asked Lian Boyu, “There is a man here whose virtue is heaven-sent in its destructiveness. If I deal with him without restraint, I endanger the state; if I deal with him with restraint, I endanger myself. His knowledge suffices only to recognize others’ faults but not the causes of those faults. In such a case, what am I to do?”

Lian Boyu replied, “Excellent question! Be vigilant, be cautious—rectify yourself! In form, nothing surpasses compliance; in heart, nothing surpasses harmony. Yet these two carry their own perils. Compliance must not become subservience; harmony must not become ostentation. If form complies and becomes subservient, you will face ruin, destruction, collapse, and downfall. If the heart harmonizes and becomes ostentatious, you will invite fame, reputation, calamity, and misfortune.

If he acts like an infant, act like an infant with him. If he acts without boundaries, act without boundaries with him. If he acts without limits, act without limits with him. Guide him thus, and he will enter a state without blemish.

Do you not know the mantis? It brandishes its arms to block a chariot’s wheels, unaware of its incapacity—such is the beauty of its talent. Be vigilant, be cautious! To accumulate praise for one’s beauty and then provoke him is perilous indeed!

Do you not know those who raise tigers? They dare not feed them living creatures, for fear of inciting their killing rage; they dare not feed them whole creatures, for fear of inciting their tearing rage. They time their hunger and satiety, understanding their temper. Tigers and humans are of different kinds, yet tigers fawn upon those who raise them—this is compliance. Thus, those they kill act in defiance.

Those who love horses use baskets to collect their dung and gourds to collect their urine. Yet when a mosquito or fly alights and they swat it untimely, the horse may break its bit, shatter its bridle, or fracture its chest. Love may reach an extreme where it incurs loss—can one not be cautious?

Guo’s commentary: The nature of petty men is such that if guided by rules, they resent restraint; if left unrestrained, they throw the state into chaos. Unaware that the people’s faults arise from oneself, they blame the people without self-correction—what then is to be done? The repeated admonitions converge on the need to rectify oneself. Form should not deviate from compliance, yet harmony does not mean sameness. Compliance in form is outward submission; subservience leads to complete assimilation. Harmony in principle is righteous aid; ostentation leads to self-promotion. Assimilation means failing to support when in peril, perishing together. Self-promotion in harmony invites slander, as he will resent being surpassed and fabricate calamities. Thus, one must blend like dust in light, rendering distinctions of closeness, distance, benefit, and harm indiscernible.

Acting like an infant avoids setting sharp edges to provoke his scales. Now, to take on a task for which one’s knowledge is inadequate is like the mantis brandishing its arms against a chariot’s wheels—accumulating talent and praise to provoke is the path to danger. Thus, compliance with principle engenders love even among different kinds, while defiance of norms turns even the closest into adversaries. In dealing with the world, the boundary between compliance and defiance cannot be ignored.

Lü’s commentary: A virtue that is heaven-sent in its destructiveness is beyond human cultivation. To engage him without restraint endangers the state; to engage him with restraint endangers oneself—no approach is viable. Recognizing others’ faults without understanding their causes makes the task all the more difficult. The error of compliance lies in subservience, which leads to assimilation; the error of harmony lies in ostentation, which leads to differentiation. Thus, ruin, destruction, collapse, downfall, fame, reputation, calamity, and misfortune arise from assimilation without knowing how to support, or differentiation without knowing how to comply.

Acting like an infant, without boundaries, or without limits—though one engages him without restraint, the state is not endangered; though one engages him with restraint, the self is not imperiled. This is to follow the nature he possesses and guide him, as when King Xuan favored bravery and wealth, and Mencius led him toward the kingly Way.

The later references to the mantis and the love of horses are illustrative analogies, their meaning clear and requiring no full explanation.

Yi Du’s commentary: “Heaven-sent destructiveness” means his evil virtue is innate and unalterable. *Fang* means “rule.” To engage him beyond the rules is to indulge his desires and corrupt order, endangering the state; to engage him within the rules is to suppress his desires and stifle his nature, endangering oneself. Recognizing his faults without understanding their causes—what is to be done? The answer is to first rectify oneself. Form, being external, should align with others—thus, nothing surpasses compliance. The heart, being internal, should differ from others—thus, nothing surpasses harmony. Compliance must not become subservience, lest it invite familiarity; harmony must not become ostentation, lest it invite self-display. Subservience and familiarity lead to ruin, destruction, collapse, and downfall; ostentation and self-display lead to fame, reputation, calamity, and misfortune. Hence the need for vigilance and caution.

*Ying’er* means “without knowledge.” *Dingqi* means “boundaries.” *Ya* means “shore.” Follow his actions, adapt without resistance, then guide him to enter a state without blemish. The mantis brandishing its arms is a warning to Yan He not to clash with his sharpness.

To nurture a tiger or tend a horse is to enable Yan He to guide them with principle.

*Detailed Daoist Annotation*: Serving a ruler is easy; instructing a ruler is difficult. Instructing a ruler is easy; instructing a crown prince is difficult. With power so exalted and position so weighty, principle struggles to transform—how much more so when his virtue is inherently destructive! This is why one must tremble with caution.

To "align in form" is to draw near without mingling, bending externally. To "harmonize in heart" is to differ without discord, remaining upright internally. External bending ensures one does not lose others; internal uprightness ensures one does not lose oneself. If one aligns and submits, one becomes boundless with them, endangering one’s state. If one harmonizes and projects, one becomes constrained with them, endangering one’s person. Thus, one must engage as with an infant—without boundaries, without shores—guiding them to enter a state without blemish. The ancients who mirrored their lord’s excesses or matched his extravagance did so for this reason.

*Yu’s Annotation*: "Trembling" follows the previous explanation.
*Bixu’s Annotation*: To collude in evil is to bring chaos to the state; to lead them by the Dao is to harm oneself. Only those skilled in the art of expansion and contraction can truly instruct them. If one examines one’s own faults, no ominous virtue remains.

To rectify oneself is the teaching without words. In form, nothing surpasses compliance—engaging without constraint. In heart, nothing surpasses harmony—seizing with principle. To comply and submit is to share in evil, leading to ruin, destruction, collapse, and downfall, thus endangering one’s state. To harmonize and project is to display self-importance, leading to fame, reputation, calamity, and misfortune, thus endangering one’s person. Therefore, from *ying’er* to the absence of shores lies the Dao of expansion and contraction, of giving and seizing.

The mantis brandishing its arms against the chariot’s wheel—with talent fine yet strength feeble, how could it not fail? Nurturing a tiger or tending a horse illustrates that controlling things lies in defense, while employing others lies in authority. To lose authority, overreach, and seek to master things is to harm oneself alone.

*Zhao’s Annotation*: Aligning in form ensures they do not distance themselves from me; harmonizing in heart supplements what they lack. Harmony is like blending broth—not sameness that makes it harmonious. Even so, one may still not escape danger. To comply and submit is to indulge the lord’s evil; to harmonize and project is to expose the lord’s evil—ruin, destruction, collapse, and downfall follow, sinking all into oblivion.

Names and omens—these are the pursuit of fame that invites calamity. Thus, one must blend radiance and merge with the dust, leaving no foothold for flaws, to attain perfection.

The three metaphors—the mantis, the tiger, and the beloved horse—differ in circumstance yet share the same intent. *Yuanzhai* observes: "Its virtue is devoured by Heaven," meaning it is consumed by the celestial. "Without method" signifies the absence of restraint. If one indulges their transgressions, the state is surely imperiled; yet to correct them invites misfortune upon oneself—what then is to be done? To instruct them to rectify themselves is to govern others by one’s own standards.

"Compliance" means following in accord. "Harmony" means attunement. Outwardly following while inwardly attuning still brings no respite. To follow in accord until one becomes indistinguishable is to comply and submit; to attune while revealing one’s edges is to harmonize and project—ruin and ominous disaster are all that remain.

The infant, the unguarded, the boundless—these depict the state of reckless ignorance. When they are thus, I simply comply; when they show signs of awakening, I subtly guide them, that they may suddenly awaken and perhaps enter a place without flaw.

The mantis raises its arms in fury—this illustrates how petty talent, puffed with self-importance, presumes to take on great matters, and seldom does it not end in failure. "Rearing tigers" and "cherishing horses" are analogies whose meaning is self-evident.

To observe Bo Yu’s instruction of Yan He is yet a step below the Master’s teaching of Zi Gao, for Zi Gao still knew to honor the Lord of Chu, bearing a mind of reverence and trepidation in service. Thus the Master warned him of the great caution inherent in fate and duty, concluding with "riding things and roaming the mind," entrusting all to necessity. Though he entrusted himself to the mission, he still preserved his sovereign integrity, never to the point of sacrificing himself for others while forgetting his own nature.

Yan He, however, already knowing that the burdens of governance could not be shouldered, yet sought to shoulder them—first doubting himself while demanding another’s trust—this was already somewhat contrary to principle. Thus Bo Yu told him, "Rectify yourself first!" Only when the root is established can the branches be raised. "Outward compliance and inward harmony" merely reflect the recognition that force cannot prevail against the prevailing tide, and so this expedient counsel is offered for self-preservation—it is no true way of governance. How much less so is the path of "complying to enter" and "harmonizing to emerge"?

To treat another as an infant, as one without guard or bound—this is the extreme of "complying to enter." Though there may be an opportunity to enlighten through timely guidance, how can one of the esteemed rank of a mentor-teacher lack the art of gentle persuasion and resort to such measures? Even if one thus leads them to understanding, it may only spare them from flaw—how can it transform others?

The mantis raising its arms in fury is precisely the metaphor for Yan He’s impending misfortune. "Rearing tigers" and "cherishing horses" further reinforce the earlier analogy, urging even greater caution.

When Carpenter Shi traveled to Qi, he passed by Qu Yuan and saw the oak that was the spirit of the land. Its girth could shade an ox, its circumference spanned a hundred spans, its height towered above the mountains by ten *ren* before branches appeared, and its sides could furnish enough timber for a dozen boats. Onlookers thronged like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter paid no heed and walked on without pause. His disciple, sated with gazing, ran to catch up with Carpenter Shi and said, "Since I first took up the axe to follow you, Master, I have never seen timber so magnificent as this. Why did you refuse to look and walk on without stopping?"

The master replied, "Enough!"

"Do not speak of it! It is a worthless tree. If made into a boat, it would sink; if made into a coffin or outer coffin, it would quickly rot; if made into vessels, they would swiftly break; if used for doors and windows, it would ooze sap; if used for pillars, it would be eaten by worms. This is a useless tree, good for nothing, and thus it has attained such longevity."

Carpenter Shi returned home, and the oak spirit of the land appeared to him in a dream, saying: "With what would you compare me? Would you compare me to the so-called 'fine timber'? Consider the loquat, pear, orange, and pomelo—all fruits of their kind. When their fruits ripen, they are stripped, their large branches broken, their small branches snapped. This is how their abilities bring suffering to their lives, so they do not complete their natural lifespan but die prematurely, self-destructing under the blows of the common world. All things are like this. As for me, I have long sought to be of no use, nearly dying in the process, until now I have attained it—this is my great usefulness. Had I been useful, could I have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—how could one thing pass judgment on another? And you, a nearly dead worthless man, what would you know of a worthless tree?"

Carpenter Shi awoke and interpreted his dream. His disciple said: "If it seeks to be useless, why does it serve as a spirit tree?"

"Hush!" he replied. "Say no more. It merely lodges there, taking it as reproach from those who do not understand it. Were it not a spirit tree, it would have been felled long ago! Moreover, what it preserves differs from the common lot, and to praise it with conventional standards is far indeed from the truth!"

At the chapter’s close, to speak of "virtue and reputation" is to seek its praise or blame through moral principles—how far removed this is! The preceding section exhaustively describes the difficulty of conducting oneself and responding to the world; this chapter again invokes the spirit oak, which preserves itself through worthlessness and fulfills the usefulness of the useless. "Nearly dying, only now have I attained it—this is my great usefulness" stands as a single truth.

"Why lament the judging of things? You and I are both endowed with form as things—would you use me?" The "scattered man on the verge of death" refers to you, who exhaust yourself with ability, nearly dying in the process. How could you, content in uselessness, comprehend my state?

The disciple further asked: If the oak’s fundamental aim is to embrace uselessness, why does it serve as a spirit tree? Carpenter Shi silenced him, saying: It merely lodges there, not seeking to be a spirit tree. Precisely because it is taken as reproach by those who do not understand it—had it not been a spirit tree, would it not have been felled long ago? Moreover, what it preserves is its lack of utility, differing from the common lot. To praise it with the standards of a spirit tree is far indeed from the truth!

This illustrates how the uncarved man preserves himself in the world, unwilling to be puffed up or lauded by others. Even if he gains reputation among his village, it is but a temporary lodging—how could he take it as honor? Only because he cannot be exploited for gain can he not be harmed.

Southward Master Ziqi roamed the hills of Shang, where he saw a great tree unlike any other—so vast that a thousand four-horse chariots could shelter beneath its canopy, its rustling leaves concealing all within. Ziqi exclaimed: "What tree is this? Surely it must possess extraordinary timber!"

Yet when he looked up at its slender branches, they were gnarled and twisted, unfit for beams or rafters. When he looked down at its massive roots, they were split and hollow, useless for coffins or outer caskets. Chewing its leaves burned the mouth, and inhaling its scent induced a three-day frenzy. Zijing remarked: "This is indeed a tree of no use—yet it has grown to such immense size!"

Alas! The spirit-like man values such uselessness.

In Song there was a region called Jing, where catalpa, oak, and mulberry were prized for timber. Those with trunks the span of a hand or arm were felled to make perches for monkeys; those three or four spans around were cut down for the beams of grand mansions; those seven or eight spans wide were sought by wealthy households for their finest coffins. Thus, before reaching their natural lifespan, these trees met their end midway under the axe—this is the calamity of being useful.

Now consider the white-browed ox, the upturned-snouted pig, or a man with hemorrhoids: none may be offered in sacrifice to the river. The shamans and priests know this well, deeming them inauspicious. Yet this is precisely what the spirit-like man regards as the greatest auspice.

Guo’s commentary: The Son of Heaven, being of no use to his hundred officials, allows them to manage their duties—those with keen eyes see for him, those with sharp ears listen for him, the wise strategize for him, and the brave act for him. What does he do? He remains profoundly still. When all talents are employed where they belong, the "useless" man becomes the one on whom all usefulness depends.

Lü’s commentary: First, the great tree ends its days in peace through its uselessness; next, the catalpa and oak of Jing meet early death under the axe, illustrating the peril of usefulness. Thus the sage and the spirit-like man, in their application of the Way, push utility to its utmost depth and conceal it in profound obscurity. Therefore, what seems useless becomes the means of all efficacy, and what appears to lack usefulness is in fact the master of all use. Those who wander the world and share in the fortunes and misfortunes of the people must understand this well.

Yi Du’s commentary: "High-named mansions" refers to grand, illustrious buildings. "Coffin planks" are the boards used for caskets. This speaks of how fine timber invites early destruction. "Jie" refers to sacrificial offerings and thanksgiving rites. The white-browed ox, the upturned-snouted pig, and the man with hemorrhoids—these three cannot be used in river sacrifices, and the shamans deem them inauspicious. Yet the spirit-like man values the usefulness of the useless, which is the true great auspice.

Detailed Daoist commentary: As the *Laozi* says: "That which is bent will be preserved whole; that which is crooked will be made straight."

The tortoise, revered for its divinity and appearing in dreams, is not as fortunate as one dragging its tail through the mud; the monkey, prized for its dexterity and displayed for its cleverness, is not as secure as one preserving its whole body in the depths of the thicket. Thus, what is deemed "without talent" is precisely what the spirit-like man values as true talent; what is called "inauspicious" is what the spirit-like man regards as the greatest auspice.

Bi Xu’s commentary: When the seven apertures are overused, they become dull and blocked; when the hundred bones are labored, they grow weary and unsustainable. Only the nameless numinous thing governs the whole, its radiance inexhaustible, filling the great void—thus do the myriad spirits find their harmonious breath.

The shamans reject and refuse to sacrifice creatures with blemishes, yet the spirit-like man honors the humble offering of sinking sacrifices.

Zhao’s commentary: The great trees of Shangqiu and the sacred beams of the altars share the same fate—like the catalpa and cypress of the Jing clan, their very usefulness prevents them from fulfilling their natural span. They are no match for the white-browed ox, the upturned-snouted pig, or the man with hemorrhoids, who preserve themselves precisely by being "without talent."

Juan Zhai observes: The trees of Shangqiu echo the theme of the previous chapter. The spirit-like man preserves his life by this very "lack of talent." The land of the Jing clan is suited to catalpa, cypress, and mulberry. *Dai* refers to a stake; *li* means the ridgepole of a house. *Gaoming* denotes a great family, that is, a household of high repute—though the pronunciation is the same, the character differs. *Jie* is the name of an ancient shamanic text. In the *Jie*, it is written: "An ox with a white forehead or a pig with an upturned snout cannot be used to sacrifice to the river." In ancient times, humans were sometimes offered in sacrifice, as in the case of Ximen Bao, hence the addition of "the man with hemorrhoids." The shamans deem these three inauspicious, yet it is precisely their "inauspiciousness" that spares them from the calamity of being killed. From the perspective of the spirit-like man, this is the greatest auspice. The various commentaries have elucidated the main idea, but some characters remain unglossed; these are appended below:

*Yin jiang long qi suo lai*—this speaks of being subtly nourished by its shade; some attach *yin* to the preceding phrase, but this is untenable. *"There must be a man of extraordinary talent"*—to punctuate this as a complete phrase and attach *fu* to the following line is incorrect. *Zhou jie* refers to wood grain that spirals and scatters. *Yi* is the perch for monkeys. *Chan bang* refers to a coffin made from a single plank. *Gaoming zhi li*—*li* should be glossed as *li* (ridgepole), following the *Liezi*: "lingering echoes coil around the beams." *Gaoming* undoubtedly means "eminent." Juan Zhai’s interpretation is most apt; this chapter shares the same meaning as the previous one. There, the addition of the man with an illness to escape the peril of river sacrifice, and the conclusion that the spirit-like man regards this as the greatest auspice, make the intent of the text abundantly clear. Here, further elaboration is unnecessary.

As for the man "Disjointed and Scattered": his chin recedes into his navel, his shoulders rise above his head, his topknot points to the sky, his five organs sit above, his two thighs press against his ribs. Mending clothes and washing laundry suffice to feed himself; winnowing chaff and sifting grain suffice to feed ten. When the authorities conscript soldiers, Disjointed waves his arms among them; when great labor is demanded, Disjointed, citing his chronic illness, is exempt from service. When grain is distributed to the sick, he receives three bushels and ten bundles of firewood. Though his body is disjointed, he nourishes himself and lives out his natural years—how much more so one who is "disjointed in virtue"!

Guo’s commentary: The spirit-like man is of no use to things, yet things each find their own use. He ascribes merit to the multitude of beings, merging with them in obscurity and leaving no trace—thus he avoids the harms of the human world. One who dwells in the substance of constant beauty is "disjointed in virtue."

Lü’s commentary: *Zhi* is not the wholeness of the body; *li* is not the unity of things. To be "scattered" is to be open and clear; to be "disjointed" is to be dispersed and diffuse—thus free from the burdens of bodily existence. Therefore, one "disjointed in form" cannot be subjected to conscription or labor; one "disjointed in virtue" cannot be encumbered by affairs.

Yi Du’s commentary: To be "disjointed in form" is to forget the body and overcome it through principle; to be "disjointed in virtue" is to forget virtue and abide by fate. To cast off the body and dull the senses is to "forget the form"; to embody the highest virtue without claiming it is to "forget virtue." The man who forgets his form preserves his body and fulfills his years, merely avoiding the harms of human entanglements. But the one who forgets virtue—his knowledge encompasses all things yet returns to the simplicity of ignorance, his illumination rivals the sun and moon yet reverts to the obscurity of darkness—how can one who merely forgets his form be mentioned in the same breath?

Bi Xu’s commentary: To dwell in the body without use is to be "disjointed in form"; to embrace the Dao as if foolish is to be "disjointed in virtue."

Zhao’s commentary: The world knows virtue as beauty but does not know virtue as a burden—hence Zhuangzi uses the parable of Disjointed and Scattered. Yong Qi observes: *Hui cuo* means a topknot. *Liang pai* refers to the two sides of the thighs. *Cuo zhen* means sewing clothes; *zhi xie* means washing clothes. *Gu jia* is the tool for winnowing grain to obtain its essence. Disjointed and Scattered, disabled in form, is exempt from labor and even receives grain and firewood—this too is the idea of preserving oneself by being "without talent." The virtue of the perfected man is likewise "disjointed," for he regards "no use" as the greatest use.

*Hui cuo*—pronounced *gui zui*. *Hui* is also pronounced *gu* (ancient *huo* cut); *cuo* is pronounced *zuo* (ancient *zi huo* cut). The topknot on the nape—Sima explains: "A topknot," for in ancient times the topknot was at the nape, the spine curved and the head lowered, so the topknot pointed to the sky. Xiang observes: The two shoulders hunch upward, forming a topknot-like protrusion. Today, the reading often follows the initial sound, and this aligns with the *Da Zongshi* chapter: "the fleshy growth points to the sky"—the character differs, but the meaning is the same.

From "his chin recedes into his navel" to "his two thighs press against his ribs" describes the appearance of his disability. *Gu xiao bo jing*—Sima explains: *Xiao* is the same as *ce*, a small winnowing basket; sifting grain is called *jing*. Cui observes: *Gu xiao* means to rub and separate; *bo jing* refers to divination and augury. Today, most follow Sima’s interpretation, as these two skills are essential for daily sustenance, allowing him to feed ten people. This is a rhetorical device, illustrating that though his form is deficient, his means of nourishment are more than sufficient.

That one so fragmented in form fares thus—how much more so one fragmented in virtue? This passage’s weight lies in the latter phrase, for virtue abhors rigidity; rigidity is no virtue. "Fragmented" means to be unconstrained and at ease in virtue, to be so unconstrained and at ease—this is the highest virtue, which does not cling to virtue.

Now, one fragmented in form escapes conscription and levies, yet grain and firewood come to him in abundance. Then one fragmented in virtue—no human harm can reach him, and the celestial rank bestows its grace. How fitting!

*The Ocean of Meanings in the Authentic Scripture of the Southern Florescence*, Scroll Nine—concluded.

---

**Postface to *The Ocean of Meanings in the Authentic Scripture of the Southern Florescence*:**
When I first read the *Zhuangzi*, I found its discourse on the equality of things wild and boundless, seemingly at odds with human sentiment.

While laid low by illness in a verdant chamber, I dreamed of one who spoke to me of the wooden cock. Thereupon, I took up the book once more and unraveled its threads, only then grasping the true intent of its discourse—most apt for saving the age, though men may yet fail to recognize it.

For since the virtue of the Zhou declined and the rites, music, punitive expeditions no longer issued from the Son of Heaven, the Warring States lords clashed and contended, reducing their people to ruin. The root of this calamity lay in ignorance of *fen*—one’s allotted place. At such a time, Zhuangzi sought to awaken the deluded and lance their affliction, hence the subtle words with which he opened *The Free and Easy Wandering*. Therein, the turtledove and the quail dare not compare themselves to the great Peng—such is the *fen*-awareness of creatures. Therein, Xu You dares not accept Yao’s empire—such is the *fen*-awareness of men. Were all under heaven to know *fen*, the lowly would not yearn for nobility, the small would not scheme for greatness, the strong would not bully the weak, the many would not oppress the few. Rulers would be true rulers, ministers true ministers, fathers true fathers, sons true sons. The whole world would rest content in the natural course of their allotted *fen*, and the scourge of usurpation, excess, and strife would vanish of itself. Thus, the inequality of things need not be forcibly equalized—all would be equal without effort.

Moreover, Zhuangzi lived in the same age as Mencius. Had his words been contrary to the Dao or of no benefit to the world’s teaching, Mencius would surely have opposed him. Yet readers, clinging to his phrasing and neglecting his meaning, often dismiss him as heterodox, echoing Guo Xiang’s judgment. How could this be true understanding of Zhuangzi?

One day, the Daoist Chu Boxiu of the Central Metropolis presented his *Explication of the Zhuangzi*, appending his own insights, and showed it to me. I rejoiced in his diligent distillation, his precise selection, and the many surpassing insights he had attained. Thus, I shared my thoughts with him. Startled, he bowed and said: *"To resolve the discourse on the equality of things with the single word *fen*—this is beyond my reach. Might I prevail upon you to write a preface and carve it upon wood?"* I replied: *"This is but my idle speculation. Are there not those in the world who penetrate this book more deeply? You should seek them out and obtain their confirmation. Another day, return to me, and we may yet refine it together. As for a preface, I dare not."*

In the fourth month of the first year of the Xianchun reign, Liu Zhensun of the Northeast inscribed this at his lodging in Gusu, the Wooden Cock’s Nest.

The Dao is one; when expressed in words, it becomes two. Thus it is said: *"The Dao asks no questions; questions receive no answer."*

It is also said: *"To know the Dao is easy; to refrain from speaking of it is difficult."* The one who knows does not speak; the one who speaks does not know. The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good. Then may we forget words? If words could be forgotten, the *Nanhua Sutra* would not have been written; if words could not be forgotten, the *Nanhua Sutra* would not exist. Yet since the *Nanhua Sutra* does exist, so too do the various schools of commentary. Nevertheless, though the *Nanhua Sutra* spans over a hundred thousand words, it has never spoken, nor has it ever not spoken. Why? Its words are all parables. Later generations seek what it has already said but do not seek what it has not said. They pore over lines and count characters, divide chapters and parse sentences—yet the more they dissect its words, the further they stray from the Dao.

Xueyan the Feathered Robe, Chu Boxiu, dwelt near the celestial realm of the Five Nuns, yet his spirit roamed above the Lacquer Garden and the waters of Pu. He compiled the various commentaries, adjudicated them with his own insights, committed them to writing, and—finding this insufficient—even carved them into wood to ensure their immortality. His effort was indeed diligent.

Alas! The Dao is transmitted through words, like Master Zhao playing the zither. The Dao cannot be transmitted through words, like Master Zhao not playing the zither. The greatest sound is soundless; whether the zither is played or not, the music remains unharmed. Yet one may catch the fish and forget the trap, seize the hare and forget the snare—is this not so? But are the trap and snare the fish and hare? The Dao and words: one yet two, two yet one.

Ah!

The *Nanhua* Classic, the various interpretations of the schools, Zhu’s limited insights, and your own conjectures—these are but layers of allegory within allegory.

Written on the fifth day of the fifth month in the first year of Xianchun by Benxin Weng and Wen Jiweng at Daoshan Hall.

Among the works of the ancient masters, such as Master Meng’s orthodoxy and Master Zhuang’s marvels, all represent the pinnacle of written expression. Though later generations have produced scholars, none have surpassed them. Yet the *Zhuangzi* is especially difficult to read. Even one of great wisdom like Su Dongpo claimed to have grasped its meaning, but upon examining his writings, his occasional discussions of Zhuangzi often still miss the original intent. How much less could those like Pang Huaiqing, whose hearts brim with venomous stings, ever attain the imperial suspension of bonds?

In recent times, those who interpret Zhuangzi have grown more numerous, and their explanations have even surpassed those of earlier scholars. Yet they inevitably buttress their arguments with the words of our sages or cling to the gateways of Chan Buddhism—appearing similar, but not truly so. I say it would be better to use the *Zhuangzi* itself to explain the *Zhuangzi*, cutting off all upward clinging and downward entanglements, so as to approach the harmonious and self-sufficient lineage and glimpse its boundaries.

Master Zhu Boxiu of Wulin, a follower of the Daoist tradition, neither Confucian nor Mohist, read this book with undivided focus, avoiding the pitfalls of straying paths and lost sheep. His singular aim was to seek the ancestral intent from a thousand years past, to synthesize the essence of various interpretations, and to append his own insights, selecting what brought him peace without dismissing others. After a lifetime of effort, he completed the work—his dedication was indeed diligent. Observing him, I see clarity in his gaze and tranquility in his spirit, the fruits of his learning.

I have long enjoyed reading Zhuangzi, often finding moments of joyful resonance, though I never committed my thoughts to writing. Now, old and ailing with dimming eyes, I can only admire Master Zhu’s accomplishment and have no leisure to scrutinize his successes or failures. Since he has exerted himself to publish his work and has asked me to write a preface for its opening, I smile and say: If the carvers’ work is not yet complete, then those who wield the mallet and chisel above could surely compose a preface for you.

Written on the *jiashen* day of the eighth month in the year *yichou* of Xianchun by Tang Hanshu of Poyang.

Zhang Zhan’s *Liezi* commentary records: Zhuangzi was a native of Mengcheng in Song, served as the magistrate of the Lacquer Garden in Liang, and composed a work in fifty-two chapters. Guo Xiang consolidated it into thirty-three chapters and wrote a commentary. Another account states: Xiang Xiu first annotated twenty-eight chapters of the *Zhuangzi* before his death, and Guo Xiang obtained his manuscript, completing it for circulation. Later, a separate version by Xiang’s family emerged, hence the similarities between the Xiang and Guo commentaries in wording and meaning.

Chen Jingyuan’s *Bixuzi* commentary notes in its preface: Zhuangzi studied under Master Changsang, received his esoteric teachings, and composed a work of over one hundred thousand characters titled *Nanhua*. The three-character titles of the Inner Chapters are original, while the Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters were edited by Guo Xiang. Now, counting the main text, only sixty-five thousand nine hundred characters remain.

In the nineteenth year of Kaiyuan during the Tang, Minister Pei Guangting requested the canonization of the Four Masters. In the first year of Tianbao, an edict decreed: The *Zhuangzi* should retain its original title, *Nanhua Zhenjing* (*True Classic of Nanhua*), as its meaning derives from the radiant essence of the southern brilliance, expounding the wonders of the Dao.

I humbly observe that the title *Nanhua* has existed for a long time. It seems to be a celestial office or duty, akin to the Eastern and Southern Poles, and cannot be recklessly interpreted through human reasoning or conjecture. Thus, no explanations of it are recorded. I have carefully presented this to address one difficulty in the introductory notes, awaiting the scrutiny of those with deeper knowledge.

**Chapter Four: "In the Human World"**

Confucius traveled to Chu, where the madman Jie Yu wandered at his gate, singing:
*"O phoenix! O phoenix!*
*How the virtue has declined!*
*The coming age cannot be awaited,*
*The past age cannot be pursued.*
*When the world follows the Dao, the sage achieves completion;*
*When the world loses the Dao, the sage preserves life.*
*In this present time, one barely escapes punishment.*
*Fortune is lighter than a feather, yet none know how to bear it;*
*Misfortune is heavier than the earth, yet none know how to avoid it.*
*Enough! Enough!*
*To govern others with virtue—*
*Perilous! Perilous!*
*To mark the ground and follow the lines!*
*O tangled vines, tangled vines, harm not my path!*
*My path winds and bends—harm not my feet!"*

Mountain trees bring ruin upon themselves; fat burns itself in the flame.
Cinnamon is edible, so it is felled; lacquer is useful, so it is slashed.
All know the use of the useful, but none know the use of the useless.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
To proceed in accord with the times, exhausting the fittingness of convergence—
The rise and fall of the world pass unnoticed, left to their own course, and principle arises and completes itself.
How could it be for order and chaos to alter their seasons?
Order seeks its own completion, thus it abandons completion and does not fail;
Chaos seeks its own survival, thus it forgets survival and does not perish.
Exhausting the convergence of the present moment, merging obscurely with the age—only then can subtlety be preserved, punishment and reputation avoided.
To know the limit of what one does not know, to halt at what one cannot do,
To employ what employs itself, to act as it acts of itself,
To indulge one’s nature within without the slightest attachment to what lies beyond—
This is the utmost ease of non-action.
There has never been one whose nature and life were not preserved through non-action.
If nature and life are preserved yet it is not called fortune, such a principle has never been heard of.
Fortune is precisely what was earlier called "preservation"—it is not borrowed from external things.
How could it bear the weight of a goose feather?
To move in accordance with one’s nature, to act without transgressing measure—this is the utmost ease in the world.
To lift what lifts itself, to bear what bears itself—this is the utmost lightness in the world.
To abandon this utmost ease of non-action and practice that utmost difficulty of action,
To cast aside this utmost lightness of self-lifting and take up that utmost heaviness of bearing others—
This is the common delusion of the world.
To seek inner fortune is why fortune is so light;
To invite external misfortune is why misfortune is so heavy.
Misfortune is heavy yet none avoid it—this is the world’s great confusion.
To trace lines on the ground and follow them, one’s tracks cannot be concealed.
To confront things with a self is to fail to merge with them.
Not using one’s own brightness to dazzle others but allowing them to find their own clarity,
Not imposing one’s own attainment upon others but leaving them to attain of themselves—
Thus one blends indistinguishably with the world, and inner and outer share the same fortune.
*"Tangled vines"*—like *"lost yang"*—means to rely on solitude, not scattering outward, bending to complete one’s path, each self-sufficient.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
When the sage achieves completion, he completes himself and completes things;
When the sage preserves life, he merely preserves his own life.
Nothing in the world is as good as the Dao—thus no fortune is greater than this.
As a thing, it is beyond sight and hearing, light as a feather, yet the world does not know how to bear it.
Nothing in the world is as evil as opposing the Dao—thus no misfortune is greater than this.
As a thing, it turns non-being into being, heavy as the earth, yet people do not know how to avoid it.
To govern others with virtue is to assert a self;
To mark the ground and follow the lines is to court peril.
*"Tangled vines"* means not knowing where to go—only by bending can one preserve oneself.
Mountain trees, cinnamon, and lacquer are felled because they bring it upon themselves.
This is to know the use of the useful but not the use of the useless.
In the human world, there is order and chaos.
To bend and preserve oneself amid chaos—this is the best way to dwell in the world.

**Yidu’s Commentary:**
When the world follows the Dao, the sage establishes ritual and music to achieve success in his age;
When the world loses the Dao, he preserves his life and keeps harm at a distance.
The sage is not attached to life—he desires his body to endure and leave a model for later ages, which may be called *"completion."*
The Duke of Zhou in Zhou was the sage’s completion;
Confucius in Lu was the sage’s preservation of life.
Fortune does not arise from within one’s nature yet is rarely sought;
Misfortune often arises from beyond one’s nature yet is ceaselessly pursued.
What lies within one’s nature can be lifted—it is strong enough to bear, light enough to carry.
How could it have the weight of a goose feather?
What lies beyond one’s nature is entrusted to the body, heavy as the earth.
The deluded drown in it and do not avoid it, for they do not understand the root of fortune and misfortune.
The root is this: *śīla, samādhi, prajñā*—these are the fortune within one’s nature.
*Rāga, dveṣa, moha*—these are the misfortune beyond one’s nature.
To govern others with virtue is to fail to merge with the Dao;
To mark the ground and follow the lines is to fail to conceal one’s traces.
*"Tangled vines"* means to obscure one’s brightness and not harm the path of preserving life.
Emptying the heart and bending to things, each finds sufficiency in its nature and portion.
Mountain trees, cinnamon, and lacquer invite destruction as metaphors for those who cannot keep harm at a distance but seek usefulness and thus injure themselves.

**Xiang Dao’s Commentary:**
The sage’s mind—how could it be narrowly occupied with ordering the world?
He merely responds to the times and rides the principle, that is all.

Those in the world who know Confucius see only his outward forms and instruments, not the moments when he was free of affairs. Thus, first recounting his traces of governing the world, he ultimately cites the song of Jie Yu to confirm it—where traces vanish, the heart is revealed. What is meant by the sage’s completion? To devote the self to the Dao and achieve success. What is meant by the sage’s life? To devote the Dao to the self and preserve life whole.

"Enough, enough!"—this refers to those who now engage in governance, who mark the ground and follow the lines. "Tangled vines, tangled vines, do not harm my steps"—this refers to those who now embody the Dao, who do so.

**Bixu’s Commentary:**
With the Dao, one delights in completion; without the Dao, one preserves life whole. Those who bear the lightest of blessings are the scholars of non-action. Those who do not avoid the heaviest of misfortunes are the followers of power and profit. To boast of virtue and govern others is to be deeply self-possessed. To drive others to follow traces is to place the Way in greater peril.

"Tangled vines" means to obscure one’s brightness—obscuring brightness preserves one’s conduct whole. "Bending" means to withdraw the self and yield to preserve wholeness, resting content within one’s portion. The metaphors of mountain trees, cinnamon, and lacquer all describe those who conform to others’ conformity rather than conforming to their own.

**Zhao’s Commentary:**
The song of Jie Yu further laments Confucius’ failure to meet his time—it is not a mockery of Confucius. "When the world lacks the Dao, the sage lives"—this speaks of the phoenix appearing out of season. For one dwelling in such times, merely escaping punishment is enough. Minor blessings cannot outweigh them; heavy misfortunes are not avoided—this speaks of how deluded the world is.

To govern others with virtue is to make others resent one’s excellence. To mark the ground and follow the lines is to make others follow one’s traces. "Enough, enough!"—this says one cannot but cease. "Perilous, perilous!"—this says the danger is insurmountable. "Tangled vines, tangled vines, do not harm my steps"—obscuring one’s brightness preserves one’s conduct whole.

The passage from "mountain trees" to "the use of the useless" is Zhuangzi’s words, used here to conclude the meaning of the preceding chapters.

**Yongzhai’s Note:**
When the world possesses the Dao, the sage may achieve success. When the world lacks the Dao, the sage merely preserves life whole.

In this present age of chaos, merely escaping punishment is already fortune—how dare one seek anything more? To survive an age of chaos and avoid punishment while preserving life whole is but a feather’s blessing, yet you remain unaware of the calamities of such times, where slaughter is ever-present—this is a weight upon the earth, yet you do not evade it. Governing others with virtue is the path to disaster; better to cease. "Marking the ground and following the lines" speaks of self-imposed restraint and suffering—truly perilous. "Tangled vines" (miyang) are a metaphor for losing the radiance of one’s original nature—how can one walk in the world? "Turning aside" (quequ) means to shield and evade. "Surely it will harm my steps" says it cannot be done.

The various explanations have been detailed above; no further repetition is needed. According to the *Shu Shi* chapter of *Wenzhongzi*: "When the world possesses the Dao, the sage conceals himself; when the world lacks the Dao, the sage becomes manifest." Though the phrasing is the same, the meaning is reversed, each serving its own purpose. I have often observed that since the Qin and Han dynasties, those who established teachings among the various schools have frequently borrowed the language and ideas of the *Nanhua* (*Zhuangzi*), yet the classics, in their use of metaphors and analogies, never tread the same path as their predecessors, becoming ever more extraordinary. This is what is meant by: "Writing may be refined, but it is not ordinary writing."

"Turning aside to avoid harm to my steps"—this is how all versions read. *Que* is often pronounced *xi*, but *Bixu* alone reads it as written. Restoring the original text, it should be *quequ* ("turning aside"), which better aligns with the preceding passage. The original likely read thus, but errors in transmission mistakenly repeated the phrase "my steps." The discerning reader will recognize this.

For those who dwell in the human world, the relationship between ruler and minister is of greatest importance and cannot be neglected. Yet one must weigh what is appropriate, carefully observe the proper timing for action or withdrawal, measure oneself against past and present without shame, and transcend regret and misfortune to preserve oneself alone—this is true excellence. Thus, when Yanzi was about to go to Wei, the Master exhaustively explained the many dangers of serving a ruler: how fame and knowledge clash, how the mind and qi remain unfulfilled, how praise turns to slander, how the bow and banner precede the blade and saw—such things are common. How much more so for a minister as unassuming and humble as Yanzi, who would hastily seek to transform a ruler in his prime, acting alone and unyielding? Preserving oneself without regret was the Master’s urgent counsel to stop him, so that the ruler of Wei might recognize that the worthy do not advance lightly, thereby strengthening his resolve to honor the Dao and naturally undergo transformation. Why rush to feed his arrogance and abet his violent ways?

Yanzi then proposed cultivating emptiness, diligence, inner integrity, and outward flexibility as means to preserve himself, but the Master said this would only spare him trouble—how could it bring about transformation? Transformation is achieved not through words but through trust, dissolving others’ resistance without need for excessive policies that provoke opposition. At this point, Yanzi had no further progress to make and asked for guidance. This was the moment when human desires were emptied and the principles of Heaven were about to appear. The Master seized this moment of awakening and instructed him in the practice of *qi* ("equalizing"), urging him to receive teaching with an empty mind: "Do not listen with the ears but with the mind; do not listen with the mind but with *qi*." Thereupon, Yanzi realized in an instant that he had never truly been "Hui" (his given name). With his mind emptied, his form too was forgotten, and transforming others became effortless.

When Zigao was about to be sent to Qi, the Master taught him to attend to affairs while forgetting himself, to observe the winds and waves while guarding against true loss. When Yan He was about to serve as tutor to the heir of Wei, the Master taught him to approach without entering and to harmonize without projecting, to understand the tiger’s anger and communicate the horse’s disposition. All this served to illustrate the manifold dangers of the world and the difficulty of navigating external things.

For those of profound insight, who perceive the subtlest signs, advancing or withdrawing in accordance with righteousness is permissible. As for the crooked axle of the oak in the shrine, which took "no preservation as its preservation," or Shang Qiu Yi, whose extraordinary abilities appeared unremarkable yet were wondrous—these further expound how talent becomes a burden, yet the world fails to comprehend. Time and again, people rely on their abilities to seek employment without considering their proper measure or the appropriateness of their station. Fame brings envy and harm; profit invites calamity. Even if one wishes to preserve oneself through clumsy self-protection, it cannot be achieved.

Thus, the overarching meaning of this chapter lies in responding to the world externally while preserving one’s true nature internally, so that the Dao is never lost and things transform of themselves. The sages and worthies of antiquity, compelled to engage with the world, invariably followed this path in secret. Hence, the dialogue between Confucius and Yanzi is presented here to elucidate it. At the chapter’s end, the song of Jieyu (the "Madman of Chu") is cited to obscure the traces of the sages’ worldly endeavors and to curb the insatiable desires of the masses. The concluding metaphors of the torch’s flame, cinnamon, and lacquer serve as particularly sharp warnings to the world.

Only by understanding the difficulty of navigating the world can one dwell in it without difficulty. As the *Taishang* says: "Even the sage finds it difficult, and thus in the end there is no difficulty."

Master Chu Boxiu of Wulin, on *"The Sign of Full Virtue"* (Chapter One)

In Lu there was a limbless man named Wang Tai. Those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius. Chang Ji asked Confucius, saying: "Wang Tai is a limbless man, yet his followers divide Lu equally with you. He neither instructs while standing nor debates while seated; yet those who come to him empty depart filled. Is there truly a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form? What manner of man is he?"

Confucius said: "This master is a sage. I am merely a latecomer who has yet to visit him. I intend to take him as my teacher—how much more should those inferior to me! Why limit it to Lu? I would lead all under Heaven to follow him."

Chang Ji said: "Though he is limbless, he surpasses you, Master. Compared to the common run, he is far beyond them. If this is so, how does he employ his mind?"

Confucius said: "Life and death are great indeed, yet he does not change with them. Though heaven and earth collapse, he would not be lost with them. He examines what is without reliance and does not shift with things; he commands the transformations of things while guarding their root."

Chang Ji said: "What does this mean?"

Confucius said: "Viewed from what differs, the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed from what is the same, the myriad things are all one. One who is thus does not know what the ears and eyes deem fitting but roams the mind in the harmony of virtue. He sees things in their unity and does not perceive their loss—regarding the loss of his foot as one would discard earth."

Chang Ji said: "He cultivates himself. Through his knowledge he attains his heart; through his heart he attains his constant heart. Why then do things vie to follow him?"

Confucius said: "Men do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water—only stillness can still the many. Receiving its mandate from earth, only the pine and cypress remain verdant through winter and summer. Receiving its mandate from heaven, only Shun was truly upright. Fortunate is he who can rectify life to rectify the lives of others. The proof of preserving the beginning lies in the substance of fearlessness. A single brave warrior can charge into nine armies. Those who seek fame and can bind themselves to it are yet like this—how much more one who governs heaven and earth, stores the myriad things, lodges in the six limbs as in a temporary abode, models the ears and eyes, unifies the knowledge of knowledge, yet whose heart never dies! He will choose a day to ascend on high, and men will follow accordingly. How would he deign to make things his concern?"

**Guo’s Commentary:**
"Coming empty and returning full—each attains what is sufficient for themselves. Though Wang Tai’s form is ruined, his heart is whole. Suddenly and alone he advances, yet none under Heaven can depart from him—how much less a single state! Life and death are humanity’s greatest transformations, yet he moves with change, so life and death cannot alter him. Though suffering and pleasure differ in nature, beauty and ugliness in feeling, each prizes what it deems beautiful—yet the myriad things share one beauty. Each affirms what it affirms—yet all under Heaven share one affirmation. If one distinguishes things by their differences, then from the vast perspective, one knows differences are not truly different. Thus, if one unites things by their sameness, one also knows sameness is not truly the same. Therefore, one unites them by their nothingness. Without beauty or ugliness, the ears and eyes find nothing unsuitable. Without unsuitability, there has never been disharmony. Regarding life and death as one, the loss of a foot is like discarding earth. Chang Ji still suspects Wang Tai has not forgotten knowledge to preserve himself or abandoned the heart to attain himself. Attaining the constant heart is to go forth evenly. If one cannot go forth evenly, one transgresses the constant with things. Thus, things come to him. Confucius illustrates with still water as a mirror—not that Tai draws things to follow him. Only the pine and cypress stand at the base; only the sage stands at the summit. Thus, those who are not upright all come seeking rectification. If all things were verdant and whole, the pine and cypress would not be prized. If all men rectified themselves, none would admire the great sage and flock to him. Fortunate is he who can rectify himself—not to rectify others by rectifying himself. Moving with transformation, there is nowhere he does not merge in darkness. His heart flows with life and death, so there is no time when he is not alive. Choosing a day to ascend is to choose without missing the encounter—this man makes no choice, but moves with heaven’s course and acts in due time. Thus, those who borrow from him vie to follow him. How would he deign to make things his concern?"

**Lü’s Commentary:**
"Those who study the Dao study what they cannot study; they practice what they cannot practice. Thus, the parable of Wang Tai. Those who follow Confucius know how to follow what they can practice but not what they cannot practice. Even if all Lu followed him, it would still be an equal division with Wang Tai. Following what one can practice means standing with instruction, sitting with debate—its teaching cannot be without words, its accomplishment cannot be without form. Following what one cannot practice means standing without instruction, sitting without debate, coming empty and returning full. Confucius and Wang Tai are but outer and inner to each other. If one does not take what one can do as the task of ruler or teacher, then the usefulness of the useless is far beyond the common—who would change with life and death? Who would be lost with heaven and earth’s collapse? Examining what is without reliance, knowing what one attains is truly not shifting with things, then life and death, collapse and ruin do not alter him—he merely commands the transformations of things. Not transforming, he guards the root and is never separated from it. Men only fail to view things from what is the same, so their ears and eyes do not inwardly connect. Able to view things from what is the same, the ears and eyes do not know what is fitting. Thus, he sees things in their unity and does not perceive their loss. Chang Ji says Tai harbors the inner sagely Dao, cultivating himself alone. Through his knowledge he attains his heart; through his heart he attains his constant heart. Why then do things vie to follow him and esteem him as ruler and teacher? Only stillness can still the many—this is why men come to him for a mirror."

The tree receives its mandate from the earth, yet only the pine and cypress remain whole. Man receives his mandate from Heaven, yet only Shun stands upright—could Shun not consider his upright birth a blessing and thereby make all men upright? Now, those knights who name themselves by courage can still charge into the nine armies—how much more so one who governs Heaven and Earth, stores the myriad things, and in whom life and death cannot effect change? This is not akin to seeking fame or making demands. He chooses his day to ascend, borrowing his comings and goings, so leisurely and thus—how could men not follow and esteem him?

Master Yi Zhu notes: At the outset, the learner gains nothing and thus goes forth in emptiness; in the end, he awakens and returns in fullness. The teacher silently imparts understanding, and the learner silently attains it. As the *Liezi* says: "Using no words as words is still speech; using no knowledge as knowledge is still knowledge."

Bound by yin and yang, one then has life and death. Riding the clouds and qi, mounting the sun and moon, life and death cannot effect change in him. Without reliance, he fulfills his nature, thus not shifting with things. Commanding things, he reaches his mandate, thus ever guarding his root.

The gallbladder clings to the liver, originally of one body. Chu and Yue are separated by thousands of miles; viewed from their differences, though of one body, they are divided by thousands of miles. Viewed from their sameness, they merge with the Dao in mystery, and the myriad things are one.

Wang Yi relied on what he heard and saw, thus unaware of what his ears and eyes deemed fitting or unified. His virtue suffered loss, and his form was not only forgotten by himself but also made others forget him. Chang Ji said that Wang Ling had not yet forgotten knowledge to make himself forget, nor had his heart attained the constant heart to surpass others—why then did things esteem him?

The answer: Wang Tai’s esteem was like still water serving as a mirror. Stillness is the natural state of nature; only one who first attains stillness can still the many. Though all are trees, only the pine and cypress stand upright, enduring frost and snow to crown the forest. Though all are men, only Shun stands upright, illuminating the myriad things and discerning human relations—how fortunate to upright his life and thereby upright all lives. To upright oneself and have things follow is the way.

The brave knight forgets life and charges into the nine armies, seeking fame and making demands—yet even he is thus. How much more so one who embodies the Dao? To govern the formed with the formless is called "officiating Heaven and Earth"; to store the myriad things with nothing is called "storing the myriad things." Lodging in the six bodily forms yet without possession, resembling ears and eyes yet without use—once knowing knows, he unites with creation, his heart never dying. Thus, he chooses his day to ascend in borrowing, his comings and goings at ease.

Master Dao notes: One replete in virtue, though maimed in form, remains whole; one lacking in virtue, though whole in form, remains deficient. Wang Tai’s virtue flourished within, his form forgotten without—life and death did not alter him, collapse and ruin did not abandon him. Thus, minor gains and losses are self-evident.

Discerning the unborrowed, he does not submit the inner to the outer; commanding the transformations of things, he does not harm the root with the branches. Though the myriad things and I differ in kind, I and the myriad things are one body. Thus, he views their unity and does not perceive their loss. The man of replete virtue sees and hears not with ears and eyes, thus unaware of what is fitting. For himself, he forgets the loss of his form and preserves his virtue; for others, they see the unity of his virtue and forget the deficiency of his form.

Hearing with the ears yet what is heard is not the ears; seeing with the eyes yet what is seen is not the eyes. Thus, he stands without teaching, yet teaching is thereby present; sits without discussing, yet discussion is thereby trusted. The constant heart is one, yet delusion and awakening naturally differ. Water’s nature is originally the same, yet its flow and stillness diverge. Water, by stillness, serves as a mirror; man, by uprightness, earns esteem.

The pine and cypress do not change their hue with cold or heat, thus among trees they are elders. Shun does not alter his uprightness with poverty or prosperity, thus among men he is a sage. Compared to Shun, though their visibility differs, their reception of Heaven and Earth’s upright mandate is the same—thus both can upright their lives to upright all lives. Yet uprighting life is the sage’s fundamental task; uprighting all lives is his secondary affair—hence it is called fortunate.

The brave knight inwardly harbors fearlessness and outwardly verifies his reputation from the outset, yet does not weigh life and death in his heart as he charges into the nine armies—this is wholeness in qi. How much more so wholeness in the Dao? One whole in the Dao officiates Heaven and Earth as his service, stores the myriad things as his provisions, lodges in the six bodily forms without possession, resembles ears and eyes without use. Knowing once, he is not divided by things; his heart abides yet is not controlled by form. His mandate lies within, not without—thus he can choose his day to ascend in borrowing.

Master Bixu notes: Unruled yet not chaotic—this is standing without teaching; unspeaking yet self-trusted—this is sitting without discussing. Purifying the heart to seek the Dao, one goes forth in emptiness; awakening to principle, one returns in fullness. Formless yet the heart is perfected; solitary yet virtue is replete.

The perfected man—Heaven and Earth cannot alter his virtue, life and death cannot change his nature. In all circumstances, he is profoundly merged, standing alone unchanged. Heaven and Earth subtly shift, yet he remains constant. Storing and concealing qi differ, yet within one body, Chu and Yue exist; movement and stillness share the Dao, thus between Heaven and Earth there is no duality.

Pursuing sounds and sights, the ears and eyes differ in what is fitting; blending self and things, affairs have no preferences. Thus, the heart without attachment reaches all destinations; self and other harmonize, gain and loss naturally vanish.

Now, seeing learners fill the gate, one calls it attaining the heart; witnessing one’s tranquil self-restraint, one calls it using the heart. The constant heart has no description—why then do things esteem him?

To observe one’s countenance, one must mirror still water; to seek the Dao, one must visit a worthy teacher. Only when the self is still can it still the hearts of all. Plants grow from the earth, and those that receive the earth’s qi in its purity are the pine and cypress. Animals are nurtured by Heaven, and those that receive Heaven’s qi in its purity are the sages. Guiding oneself with rectitude and following the teachings of emptiness and silence—thus the great man wages war with the Dao against life and death, and neither fame nor power are worthy of mention.

Heaven and Earth have their offices, movement and stillness have their gatherings; the body is not one’s own, so seeing and hearing are not employed. What is known is not two—how then could the heart ever die? One ascends at the appointed time, for departure and abiding have their seasons. Borrowing from others follows what is right; the true man follows himself.

Zhao’s commentary: When Wang Tai was crippled and maimed, all despised him, yet Confucius wished to lead the world to follow him. The Master’s vision far surpassed that of ordinary men, so he asked how Wang Tai cultivated his heart. Confucius spoke of Wang Tai’s Dao: the myriad things have life and death, yet he has no life and death; Heaven and Earth may collapse and fall, yet he has no collapse and fall—this is because he examines what is without reliance and guards his root.

Chang Ji did not understand, so Confucius again used the analogy of one body and the myriad things: the liver and gallbladder, Chu and Yue, are the same yet different; things and the self are different yet the same. Thus, with no seeing and no hearing, one accords with nature; self and things merge, and how could one know the loss of one’s feet? Chang Ji suddenly awakened and said: His learning is for the self—through his knowledge, he attains his heart, meaning the empty, numinous, knowing heart naturally attains knowledge through itself; attaining his constant heart means entering the state of neither death nor life through this empty, numinous knowing. What Wang Tai attained was no more than this—why then does the world esteem him?

Confucius further illustrated that only stillness can still all stillness, and only rectitude in life can rectify the lives of all, to clarify that what gives life does not live, and what transforms things is not transformed. He also spoke of the evidence of preserving the beginning and the reality of fearlessness: the beginning existed before Heaven and Earth, and one who preserves it will not fear even when life and death stand before him. Those brave men who die for fame are already thus—how much more so for one who has never died? This Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, completes the myriad things in their diversity, and merely lodges in the six bodily forms, shaping them through the ears and eyes, enduring through all ages.

Ascending to the realm beyond is like rising to Heaven. Yongzhai said: Without form, there is nothing to see. The heart is formed, and things are transformed by its resonance. *Zhi hou* means "still later." *Xi jia* means "how could it be merely this?" The line "Life and death are indeed great" is where the discussions of the Buddhists all originate. "Heaven and Earth collapse and fall" is like the *Great Commentary* saying: "Qian and Kun are destroyed and lost," which also means collapse and fall. "Examining what is without reliance" means fully perceiving its reality. "Commanding the transformation of things" means the myriad things receive their mandate from me. The root is the beginning of things.

Ordinary people do not know that things share a single origin; even the liver and gallbladder are divided like Chu and Yue. If one knows this, then the myriad things and the self are one, and one does not merely listen with the ears or see with the eyes. Seeing things as one, one perceives no loss—this means that in observing the myriad things, nothing is lacking or excessive. Reading the chapter on Kui and Huan reveals this meaning. "For the self" means cultivating the self. "Through his knowledge" means that if one has this discernment, one can cultivate this self. "Attaining his heart through his heart" means that if one has this knowing heart, one can attain one’s original heart. The original and the knowing are not two things—this is merely how it is expressed. It means that all people have knowledge and a heart; if one can fully realize them, one can cultivate the self and attain the heart. Attaining the constant heart is all—why then does the world esteem him?

Flowing water and still water both serve as metaphors for the heart: the heart that can still itself is thus superior to the multitude. The multitude uses the heart of desire to seek stillness, hence the saying: "Only stillness can still all stillness"—this phrase is profoundly marvelous. The pine and cypress, Yao and Shun, uniquely receive what is proper from Heaven, so they can rectify their lives to rectify the lives of all. Life and nature share the same meaning. Preserving the original beginning has its evidence. The reality of fearlessness means that even men like Jing Ke and Nie Zheng could remain unchanged by life and death—how much more so for those with the Dao?

Heaven and Earth have their offices, movement and stillness have their gatherings. The body is not one’s own, so seeing and hearing are not employed; what is known is not two—how could the heart ever die? One ascends at the appointed time, for departure and abiding have their seasons. Borrowing from others follows what is right; the true man follows himself. The eyes resemble eyes yet are not limited to seeing; the ears resemble ears yet are not limited to hearing. Thus, how could there be anything that the knowledge of one knowing does not know?

The heart that sees nothing is called death—how could one choose a day to ascend to the Dao? This means one is always in the Dao. Establishing the teaching that is not taught, the world is transformed; sitting in the discussion that is not discussed, the world trusts. Without virtue fully within and things corresponding without, one is not equal to this. This is the Dao by which Wang Tai is still and by which one comes to mirror him. Learners wash their hearts to seek teaching, so they go empty; in the end, they truly see inner fullness, so they return fulfilled. Without emptiness, one cannot receive teaching; without fulfillment, one cannot awaken to principle. At the utmost awakening to principle, clarity and penetration are complete; things come and are mirrored—this is emptiness alone.

Thus, the essentials of the Dao are nothing else: the good teacher assists the naturalness of things; the good learner seeks to return to their naturalness. Using without imposing, the body naturally manifests—there is no need to add adornment. The *Highest* says: "I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves"—this is the teaching that is not taught, the ultimate teaching. Confucius said: "What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed"—this is the discussion that is not discussed, the ultimate discussion. This is how the ancient sages taught people—it is up to the learner to respond accordingly.

Again, "for the self, through his knowledge he attains his heart, through his heart he attains his constant heart"—why then does the world esteem him?

The Guo school parses "through his knowledge he attains his heart, through his heart he attains his constant heart" as a single phrase, leaving "attains his constant heart" unaddressed. Cheng, Lin, and Wang all follow Guo’s interpretation. Only Master Lü parses it as "through his heart he attains his constant heart," which clarifies the meaning of the preceding and following text. Xu Qi and Wu Yin both adhere to Lü’s interpretation, and we follow it here.

Furthermore, the passage "receiving mandate from earth... only Shun alone is upright" appears irregular in phrasing, suggesting possible omissions. Chen Bixu’s *Illuminating* edition, collated by Zhang Junfang, reads: "Receiving mandate from earth, only the pine and cypress alone are upright, remaining verdant through winter and summer; receiving mandate from heaven, only Yao and Shun alone are upright, standing at the head of all things." Seven characters are thus restored, making the text coherent and complete. Guo Xiang’s commentary states: "Below, only the pine and cypress stand upright; above, only the sage stands upright." This confirms that the original scripture likely included the phrase "standing at the head of all things," which was lost in transmission.

Additionally, regarding "He then selects a day to ascend and transcend," Guo Xiang ends the sentence at "ascend" and treats "transcend" as a loan for "假" (borrow/assume), linking it to the following text. Chen Bixu follows this interpretation, while Master Lü reads "transcend" as "遐" (distant), ending the sentence there. Yi Du, Xiang Dao, Wang Pang, and Xu Zhai all adopt Lü’s reading. Upon reflection, "假人" (assuming human form) lacks coherent meaning, whereas "革从登遐" (transforming and ascending to the distant) makes the passage clear: it describes those who attain this Dao as unbound by departure or stay, ascending to the profound and remote realm. Further evidence appears in the *Liezi* ("King Mu of Zhou" chapter), where "登假" is consistently read as "登遐," supporting the view that Yong Qi’s gloss of "假" as "格" (to reach) derives from the later phrase "登假於道" (ascending to transcendence in the Dao).

Shentu Jia, an amputee, studied under Bohun Wuren alongside Zichan of Zheng. Zichan said to Shentu Jia: "If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay." The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia: "If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay. Now I am about to leave—can you stay? Or will you not?" He added, "When you see the one in power, you do not avoid him—do you consider yourself equal to him?"

Shentu Jia replied: "In the Master’s school, are there truly those in power like this? You delight in your own authority and look down on others. I have heard: when a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if dust settles, it is not bright. To dwell long with the worthy is to be without fault. Now, what you value most is the Master—yet you still speak like this. Is this not a fault?"

Zichan said: "Given your condition, you still vie with Yao in virtue—do you not reflect that your virtue is insufficient to compensate for your loss?"

Shentu Jia replied: "Those who justify their faults, claiming they should not perish, are many; those who do not justify their faults, claiming they should not survive, are few. Knowing one cannot help it and accepting it as fate—only those of virtue can do this. Wandering within Yi’s drawn bow: the center is the target, yet missing it is fate. Many mock my incomplete limbs! I bristled with anger, but when I came to the Master’s place, my anger dissolved and I returned to myself. Did the Master wash me with goodness? I have wandered with you for nineteen years and never knew I was an amputee. Now you wander with me within the realm of form and seek me beyond it—is this not a fault?"

Zichan, startled, changed his expression and said: "Say no more!"

Guo’s commentary: "I leave, you stay"—Zichan felt shame at walking alongside an amputee, prideful in his own authority, revealing his arrogance. Shentu Jia spoke of virtue, not rank. Zichan retorted that Shentu Jia, though maimed, belittled those in office, aspiring to equal the virtuous—yet his virtue could not compensate for his loss. Shentu Jia replied that justifying his faults, claiming he should not perish, were many; silently acknowledging them, accepting he should die, were few. When profit and harm contend, the world is like Yi’s drawn bow. Those who do not abandon themselves or forget knowledge, flowing with things, all wander within Yi’s range—even Zhang Yi’s ventures and Shan Bao’s seclusion could not escape it. Hitting the mark or not is a matter of fate. Mocking my incompleteness shows ignorance of fate; my anger at them shows further ignorance. Seeing the perfected one, who knows fate and forgets form, my anger subsided and I returned to normal. Did the Master wash me with the good Dao? Did I reflect on myself? Form is external; virtue is internal. Now you wander with me in virtue, yet seek my external appearance—is this not a fault? Zichan’s "Say no more" shows he had awakened and found the words excessive.

Lü’s commentary: Shentu Jia could disregard form and forget worldly power, while Zichan, pleased with his authority, could not forget his own. Those who nearly attain the Dao wash their hearts of dust to return to clarity, like a mirror. Yet speaking as you do shows the mirror is not bright, and dust settles. I do not justify my faults, claiming I should not perish, so I know I cannot help it and accept it as fate. Wandering within Yi’s drawn bow: the center is the target, a metaphor for acting without regret and thus avoiding harm. Missing it is fate, a metaphor for misfortune one cannot escape. Mocked for my incompleteness, I could not help but bristle with anger—yet coming to the Master’s place, I was transformed by the Dao and forgot it. Did he wash me with goodness? Did I awaken myself? Nineteen years is the full cycle of yin and yang. Wandering within the realm of form, he never knew I was an amputee—yet now you seek me beyond it. Is this not a fault?

Lin’s commentary: "Not violating" means "not avoiding." "Equal" means standing shoulder to shoulder with him. Zichan boasted of his governance and belittled others; Shentu thus used the mirror as a metaphor to reproach him. Zichan, seeing Shentu’s mutilated form yet still contending with him, was like one vying with Yao in virtue. Shentu said that among worldly people, many justify their faults as reasons they should survive, while few acknowledge their faults as reasons they should perish. He meant that Zichan had not forgotten things or abandoned form, valuing his own governance while slighting the virtue of the amputee. He also said that to vie with Yao in virtue was to justify one’s faults while unaware of impending ruin. To know the inevitable and accept it is to know fate. The range of the bow’s power is called its drawn circle—a metaphor for his own lack of the Dao to claim amputation, and thus amputation being fate. "Within the realm of form" refers to the principles of Dao, virtue, nature, and destiny; "beyond the realm of form" refers to the state of hands, feet, and physical appearance.

Detailed Daoist commentary: One whose virtue is full regards wealth and honor as floating clouds, and the body as a temporary lodging. Zichan, clinging to his rank to lord over the lowly and relying on his wholeness to despise the amputated, was unfit to speak of virtue—how then could he speak of fate? Thus it is said: wandering within Yi’s drawn bow, missing the mark is fate. Anger is the dust of one’s nature; once awakened, the dust is swept away and the mirror shines—this is one who was lost and then found.

Bixu’s commentary: Zichan studied under Bohun’s Dao yet could not forget the self; Shentu shared the same teacher yet could not forget virtue—how much less could those beneath them? That many claim they should not perish adorns their wrongs; that few claim they should survive shows how rare it is to blame oneself.

Within Yi’s drawn bow lies the metaphor: though one seeks wholeness, one cannot escape—all is Heaven’s mandate. When others laugh at my incompleteness, I bristle with anger, for the winds of indignation and the fires of resentment still burn within. Yet upon entering the Master’s presence, I am suddenly stilled, as though gazing into a pool of still water.

For nineteen years I wandered with him, yet never once did I perceive his lameness—such is one who forgets virtue and forgets form.

Zhao’s commentary: Most in the world adorn their faults, insisting their feet should not have perished, while few acknowledge their true transgressions! Fortune and misfortune alike are as when Yi, master archer, aims for the center of the target—a place of certain strike—yet one in ten thousand may escape. This is fate. How can one not count oneself fortunate? Instead, they mock others, and when mocked in turn, they cannot help but chafe with resentment—this too is ignorance of fate. But before Bohun, all such vexation dissolves.

When I wandered with Bohun, I never once perceived my own lameness. Now you wander with me within the bounds of form, where the six senses are but temporary lodgings, and the ears and eyes mere semblances—thus you and I are one. Yet you seek me beyond the bounds of form, where you are you and I am I, and no knowing passes between us.

Zichan bowed and said: "Sir, say no more. I recognize my error."

Yongzhai remarked: The phrase *"contending with Yao in goodness"* is also striking. You are lame—even if you do good, can you match Yao? Not reflecting on oneself is not measuring oneself. Those lost in their faults believe their feet should not have perished in multitudes; those not lost in their faults believe their feet should not have endured in few. Only those of virtue understand that all is fate—what can man do about it? These three lines describe three kinds of people.

The passage on *"wandering within Yi’s drawn bow"* is especially profound! It speaks of man in the world, where every movement is a perilous mechanism. The drawn bow’s aim is the arrow’s destined path—a metaphor for the world’s dangers. Whether one hits the mark or not is fate.

The discourse on *"within and beyond form"* reveals what no former sage has expressed. Shentu accepted fate and forgot his lameness; his virtue filled his inner being, leaving no sorrow for the outer. Zichan, proud of his rank and scornful of the lame, was enslaved to externals and blind to his inner truth. Though they studied together under Bohun, how could one so attached to power and position ever forget and be transformed by the Way? His mind’s mirror remained clouded, and dust settled upon it.

*"Those who should not have perished are many; those who should not have endured are few"*—this is Shentu’s judgment on the survival of feet, for few who are lame recognize their faults and accept them. Yet fortune and misfortune alike return to fate, revealing that Shentu’s lameness arose from no fault of his own. Some misinterpret these two lines as referring to Zichan’s inability to forget form and grasp principle, but this is far off the mark.

Within Yi’s drawn bow, every place is a target—if one escapes, it is mere luck. Man in the world is never without care; if he finds respite, it is fortune alone. Yet when others mock my misfortune as their good luck, I still feel anger, for I have not forgotten myself. But when I am suddenly stilled and return to myself, I too am forgotten. Was it the Master who washed me with goodness? Or was it my own awakening? Then self and other are both forgotten, and subject and object intermingle—what room is left for joy or anger, or for seeking form?

Scholar Chu Boxiu of Wulin

**Chapter Two: The Sign of Full Virtue**

In Lu there was a man named Shushan Wuzhi, who had lost his toes. He came to see Confucius, walking on his heels.

Confucius said, “You were not careful before, and now you have suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?”

Wuzhi replied, “I did not know what was important and so carelessly used my body—thus I lost my foot. But now that I come, I still have what is more honorable than feet. I strive to preserve this wholeness. Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be like Heaven and Earth—how could I have known you would be like this?”

Confucius said, “I am indeed shallow! Why do you not come in? Please share what you have heard!”

Wuzhi departed. Confucius said to his disciples, “Take heed! Though Wuzhi is maimed, he still strives to study and make amends for past wrongs. How much more should one of full virtue do so?”

Wuzhi spoke to Lao Dan, saying, “Is Confucius not yet a perfected person? Why does he so eagerly take me as his student? He seeks to be known for strange and marvelous teachings, yet does not realize that the perfected person sees these as shackles.”

Lao Dan said, “Why not simply lead him to see life and death as a single thread, the acceptable and unacceptable as one continuum, and thus free him from his bonds? Would that not suffice?”

Wuzhi said, “Heaven has punished him—how can it be undone?”

---

**Guo’s Commentary:**
*Tread* means to follow closely. In life, one should not force things but let them arise naturally—this is valuing the body and knowing what is important. To forget one’s natural arising and act with caution and self-importance is to use the body lightly. “Still having what is more honorable than feet” means that though one foot was cut off, his virtue remained unharmed. To abandon self-importance and let things arise naturally is how one strives for wholeness. If Heaven and Earth were mere covering and bearing, they would sometimes rest—but Wuzhi, having heard what he heard, left, still finding it strange that Confucius would then go to study under Lao Dan. To teach others to find their own attainment is to follow the constant way; to abandon oneself and imitate others is to seek an extraordinary reputation. Thus, study is not for the sake of marvels, yet marvels arise from it; ritual is not for the sake of ornamentation, yet ornamentation flourishes through it. The perfected person sees these as fetters and seeks to merge with true principle. Confucius was not without this merging, but in following things, fame inevitably arises—he could not escape fame, and so how could his fetters be undone?

**Lü’s Commentary:**
Though Wuzhi lost his foot, what enabled him to walk was never forgotten—this is what is meant by “what is more honorable than feet.” Confucius wished to invite him in and discuss what he had heard, for the nature of things and the Dao of Heaven are not topics for casual learners. Wuzhi said nothing and departed, for there were things between them that could not be spoken aloud. His remark, “eagerly taking me as his student,” suggests doubt that Confucius was truly a perfected person. The Dao sees the cessation of learning as perfection, so what the world studies, the perfected person views as strange, marvelous, and shackling to the self. Only when life and death are seen as a single thread and the acceptable and unacceptable as one continuum are the shackles undone. Why not lead him to this? But what can be undone is human punishment; Heaven’s punishment cannot be undone.

**Yi Du’s Commentary:**
“Not knowing what is important” means forgetting things. “Using the body lightly” means forgetting form. “What is more honorable than feet” refers to the Dao. Wuzhi strove to preserve the Dao and forget the body, so that though the body was external, it remained intact. To compare the Master’s virtue to Heaven and Earth, yet still reproach him for lack of care and belatedness—this is to speak in terms of progress. But if one speaks from the heart, Confucius’s admission of shallowness and request to enter and discuss what he had heard are fitting. Wuzhi understood in silence, so Confucius urged his disciples to take note. Later, seeing Lao Dan, he doubted that Confucius eagerly studied to seek strange and marvelous fame, not realizing that the perfected person sees these as fetters. Why not consider how to free him? Confucius’s study under Lao Dan was simply what worldly affairs required, not out of any ulterior motive. Laozi, seeing that Wuzhi had not yet understood his heart, sought to free him from his bonds. Wuzhi believed it was Heaven’s decree and could not be undone.

**Xiang Dao’s Commentary:**
Shentu and Shushan, both maimed, approached Wang Tai—their maiming was the same, but how they bore it differed. Shushan and Shentu both strove to learn, but their reasons for learning differed. From the perspective of affairs, fame in teaching is honorable; from the perspective of the Dao, fame is a burden to the self. Thus, those of old who attained the Dao merged gain and loss into one and returned merit and fame to the multitude—this is called the “suspended release of the emperor.” Who could then honor or shame them? Yet worldly people compete for empty reputations in their time and scheme for posthumous glory, tormented and unaware of return, constrained and unable to find ease. How is this different from a prisoner in shackles? Confucius did not seek the strange to carve out a name; if he hated these fetters and sought to free himself, he would be acting against fate and doing even more. Where is the Confucius in that?

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:**
“What is more honorable than feet” refers to nature. If nature is not harmed, one can be called whole. Confucius invited Wuzhi into his chamber to discuss the Dao, but Wuzhi’s gaze conveyed his meaning, and he left without speaking. Confucius used Wuzhi’s example to instruct his disciples. Wuzhi said to Lao Dan, “Why does Confucius so eagerly take me as his student? He seeks fame through strange and marvelous teachings, yet does not realize that the perfected person sees these as punishment. Why not lead him to see that above, he is one with creation—life and death a single thread—and below, he is equal with things—the acceptable and unacceptable one continuum? Heaven’s punishment cannot be undone, for he has not yet erased his traces.”

**Zhao’s Commentary:**
The exchange between Shushan and Confucius is similar in meaning to the earlier one between Shentu and Zichan. Confucius transmitted the Dao and cultivated teaching, causing scholars from all over to gather provisions and flock to him—this is what is meant by seeking fame through strange and marvelous teachings.

Lao Dan said to Wuzhi, “Why not lead Zhongni to reflect on how to free himself from his fetters? To know this principle is to be without entanglements.”

Wuzhi replied, “Once a person has form, there are burdens—how can one soar high and remain beyond the world? Thus I say, how can Heaven’s punishment be undone?”

Yongzhai noted: “Not knowing one’s duty” means failing to understand affairs. “Honoring the foot” refers to one’s nature—these two characters are strikingly apt. “Eagerly” and “reverently,” “strange” and “marvelous” describe his pursuit of fame. “Fetters” mean fame becomes one’s burden. “Heaven’s punishment” is like Heaven’s penalty. All this is allegory.

Consider Wuzhi, who was maimed, yet still strove to study and redress his past misdeeds—how much more should one of complete virtue do so? These words benefit the world’s teachings.

The first chapter speaks of Wang Tai, who attained the Dao and fulfilled his destiny; the next of Shentu, who possessed virtue and understood destiny; this chapter of Wuzhi, who studied diligently to amend his faults. *Nanhua* discusses three grades of virtue’s fullness, echoing the sequence in *The Human World*.

The Master said of Shushan that his carelessness led to his punishment—his maiming must have had a cause. He himself admitted his folly in recklessly using his body, recognizing his error. Only by knowing one’s faults can one correct them, so the sage’s gate does not cast them out. “Honoring the foot” refers to what animates the form; by striving to preserve it, one seeks the Dao.

Wuzhi regarded the Master as heaven and earth, believing he could shelter and sustain him. The Master pointed to his past errors, saying, “What can be done now?” Wuzhi sighed at this, harboring dissatisfaction, unaware that the Master’s words were precisely the Way of sheltering and sustaining him. If Wuzhi reflected on how to amend his past faults, would the loss of his limb diminish his wholeness? This shows how sages and worthies transform and nurture, shaping all things without neglecting any grade of person—yet their accomplishments vary in degree, as seen in this chapter.

Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, “In Wei there is an ugly man named Aitai Tuo. Men who live with him grow attached and cannot leave. Women who see him beg their parents, ‘Rather than be another man’s wife, let me be his concubine’—dozens have done so. He never initiates speech but only harmonizes with others. Lacking a ruler’s position, he rescues people from death; without amassing wealth, he fills others’ bellies. His ugliness startles the world, yet he harmonizes without leading, and his wisdom does not extend beyond his domain. Yet men and women gather before him—he must possess something extraordinary. I summoned him to observe, and indeed, his ugliness startled the world. Living with me for less than a month, I took interest in his character; before a year had passed, I trusted him. With no minister in the state, I offered him the throne. He responded reluctantly, as if declining. I was ashamed, yet in the end, I entrusted him with the state. Soon after, he left me and departed. I grieved as if bereft, as though no one remained to share the joy of ruling the state. What manner of man is he?”

Confucius said, “Once I traveled to Chu and saw piglets nursing from their dead mother. After a moment, they shrank back and fled, for they no longer saw themselves in her, nor found her like them. What they loved in their mother was not her form but what animated it. Warriors who die in battle are not buried with military honors; those who lose a limb no longer cherish their shoes—neither retains its root.”

For the Son of Heaven’s consorts, they do not pare their nails nor pierce their ears; those who take a wife remain beyond the inner chambers and are no longer employed in service. If even those whose form is whole suffice for this, how much more the man of whole virtue? Now, Ai Taituo spoke not a word yet was trusted, had no merit yet was cherished, and was offered a state with such urgency that he feared only he might refuse—this must be one whose talent is complete and whose virtue leaves no trace.

Duke Ai said, “What is meant by *complete talent*?”
Confucius replied: “Life and death, survival and ruin, success and failure, wealth and poverty, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of events, the movements of fate. They alternate before us day and night, yet knowledge cannot compass their beginning. Thus they cannot disturb harmony or enter the numinous chamber. Let them flow smoothly without losing their joy; let day and night pass without hindrance, ever bringing spring to things—this is to meet them with a heart that generates the seasons. This is called *complete talent*.”

“What is meant by *virtue that leaves no trace*?”
“Stillness is the fullness of water at rest. It may serve as a model, for within it preserves its clarity while outwardly remaining undisturbed. Virtue is the cultivation of perfect harmony. When virtue leaves no trace, things cannot depart from it.”

Later, Duke Ai told Minzi: “At first, I thought that facing south to rule the world and holding the people’s guiding thread while fearing their death was the height of understanding. Now, hearing the words of a perfected man, I fear I lack their substance—have I not recklessly spent myself and lost my state? Between Confucius and me, there is no lord and minister, only a bond of virtue as friends.”

Guo’s commentary: Those who startle the world yet draw people to them do so not through power or favor, nor through outward beauty. The man of complete talent harms nothing. Thus, he enters the beasts’ herds without disturbing them, joins the birds’ flocks without scattering them, and becomes a refuge for the ten thousand things.

When Duke Ai kept company with him, within less than a month he sensed his lofty purpose; before a year had passed, he entrusted him with the state’s governance. He responded with serene indifference, declining as if in passing, untroubled by honor or disgrace. The living are classed by talent and virtue; when these depart in death, they lose their kind and flee. If the essence remains akin, though forms differ, things harbor no ill will. If the essence is no longer akin, even mother and child cannot secure their bond. What animates form is talent and virtue.

A warrior’s armor is what he relies upon; if he dies in battle, what use is armor? When selecting consorts or celebrating a new marriage, all focus on outward beauty—thus even the highest may be swayed in their affections, and a chaste woman’s resolve may falter. Yet when virtue is whole, things naturally love it. Life and death, survival and ruin, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these principles are fixed and inescapable.

Man’s life is no mistake; what life possesses is no illusion. Though heaven and earth are vast and the ten thousand things many, what I encounter is precisely this—exerting all strength and wisdom cannot alter it. Fate moves, events change, ceaselessly day and night, their beginnings beyond knowledge’s compass, thus beyond the heart’s attachment. Knowing fate’s inevitable course and events’ certain change, why cling to endings or beginnings, to the new or the old?

If one knows the constancy of nature and fate, though life and death, success and failure shift endlessly, one remains serene and self-possessed, harmony and principle dwelling within. The numinous chamber is the dwelling of the spirit; let no sorrow or alarm disturb it. Let harmony remain undisturbed, the numinous chamber at ease, never losing its joy—then, in tranquil accord, follow the four seasons and transform with them.

Of all things level, none surpasses still water. Within, it preserves its clarity; without, it remains free of pretense. Its dark mirror penetrates all, impartial to things—thus it perfects its stillness and enacts its model. Nothing it does not accomplish, nothing it does not harmonize. This is virtue that leaves no trace, and so the world delights to exalt it without tiring.

Lü’s commentary: Without lordly position, the most noble virtue cannot be named. Without accumulated wealth, the richest enterprise cannot be compared. When the world seeks it through desire and fails, they deem it most rare and long for it. The spirit has no fixed place yet is nowhere absent—thus knowledge does not exceed the four bounds. The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang, yet are distinct. Male and female unite before them, wondrous in their yin and yang beyond fathoming—thus one suspects they differ from others.

Serene and indifferent, declining as if in passing—this is not one who takes things as his concern. Entrusting him with the state was but a lodging. Soon after, he departed, and the duke mourned his loss as if bereft. The piglets’ nursing from their dead mother illustrates how the spirit in the mother is what is in the child, for they are of the same kind. When the spirit leaves the mother, they are no longer of a kind—thus they flee.

A warrior’s armor is for self-defense; if he dies in battle, what use is armor? The amputee’s disregard for his shoes—both have lost their root, for the spirit animates the form, which is their foundation. Consorts and new brides are valued for their whole form, how much more one of whole virtue? Trusted before speaking, cherished without merit—this must be one whose talent is complete and whose virtue leaves no trace.

Life and death, survival and ruin, and the rest are events when viewed by man, but the movements of fate when viewed by heaven. They alternate day and night, beyond knowledge’s compass—how could I presume to interfere? Harmony is what the spirit delights in. The numinous chamber is the spirit’s dwelling. When the spirit is harmonious, at ease, and never loses its joy, it knows no hindrance, no division of day and night, ever bringing spring to things—this is to meet them with a heart that generates the seasons.

Water’s stillness and clarity are its nature; within, it preserves itself, outwardly undisturbed—do not disturb it. The analogy of human nature is the same.

All things complete themselves to achieve fulfillment; all things unite as one to attain harmony. Virtue is the cultivation that brings completion and harmony.

When virtue leaves no trace, it returns to the primordial; how could things depart from their source of generation? As Lin Zhu notes: Though Aitai Tu held no rank or stipend, his repulsive appearance shocked the world, yet his inner abundance of talent and virtue drew the multitudes to him. Unbound by external divisions, he knew no limits within the four directions, uniting with things as one—thus male and female gathered before him. Placid and drifting, his bearing revealed no intent, no attachment. Soon he departed, for he was hard to approach yet easy to part from.

The piglet and its mother are of the same kind in life, but not in death—this illustrates how the noble person takes talent and virtue as kinship, not physical form as affection. Form refers to the six limbs and senses. What governs form is the principle of the Dao, virtue, nature, and destiny.

To die in battle yet leave one’s armor unused, or to be maimed yet discard one’s shoes—this shows that form takes talent and virtue as its foundation; without this foundation, form is useless. Concubines, attendants, those who pierce ears or take wives—all harm form for the sake of utility, selecting only those with whole bodies. How much more should one value those with whole virtue!

Life and death, survival and ruin, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of events and the movements of fate, alternating day and night. Even the most discerning cannot fathom their beginning, yet those with complete talent know no gain or loss, simply following them. Thus they do not disrupt harmony, never lose their joy, know no division of day and night, and ever bring spring to things, generating life within the heart.

This speaks of the boundless transformations of creation, where things arise anew each day, yet those who do not become things never perish. To meet and generate the seasons within the heart is for the perfected person to respond to things with the times, moved and thus penetrating all.

Still water, perfectly level, becomes the model for all under heaven. So too is one whose virtue leaves no trace. Virtue is the cultivation that brings harmony and completion, acting without awareness of its action. When virtue leaves no trace, things do not depart; success is achieved without awareness of its achievement.

As the *Dao* commentary explains: Wang Tai, though maimed, drew the most followers; Aitai Tu, though ugly, lost none. For there was reverence for his form, which remained whole despite his maiming; there was admiration for his supreme countenance, which remained beautiful despite his ugliness. This supreme countenance is one whose talent is complete and whose virtue leaves no trace. Men and women admired him, birds and beasts drew near, even rulers wished to entrust him with their states—not by preserving things for them, but by things preserving themselves.

Maternal love takes form as its foundation; warriors take courage as theirs; travelers take feet as theirs. That Aitai Tu was employed while present and missed when gone was because he had a foundation. When virtue is complete, it manifests as talent; when talent is complete, it enters as virtue. When virtue leaves no trace, one moves through life and death, survival and ruin without losing joy, never exchanging the self for things.

From the unbroken flow of day and night to the generation of seasons within the heart, one does not forget things for the self. Preserving within, one loses nothing of substance; undisturbed without, one is not swayed by reputation. Virtue is simply the cultivation of one’s nature, returning to completion and harmony.

Duke Ai’s relationship with Confucius began as ruler and subject but ended as friends in virtue—his awakening was indeed subtle. As Bi Xu notes: Power and wealth can sustain life, so the multitudes gather to them. Yet a common man draws crowds because his virtue is like a mountain. The self is one’s nature: in life, it remains of the same kind; in death, it loses its kind. When the sow loses her nature, the piglet loses its kind and flees—this illustrates how Duke Ai, lacking virtue, drove the perfected away.

Banners honor valor; shoes adorn feet. To die in battle or lose a foot is to forget one’s foundation—what use are adornments? The sixteen aspects—life and death, survival and ruin, cold and heat—are the dusty net of the world. Few who enter it escape; to entrust it to fate is to fill with virtue. Yet this is still the path of those within the world. Those who wander beyond it are suddenly and utterly freed, entering the great mystery. Thus Confucius could forget words, and Duke Ai ceased his questioning.

The vicissitudes of events, the ceaseless flux of morning and evening—though skilled astronomers measure and calculate, none can fix what lies ahead. Who could reckon their end? When the numinous chamber is empty, harmony and principle arise naturally. At ease and unobstructed, not bound by the constant, the joy of contentment and the emptiness of the wondrous heart are never interrupted.

The flourishing energy of spring is the same as the sagely heart that nurtures all things. The fullness of still water is what the great craftsman takes as his model. Virtue within completes the person; virtue without harmonizes things. The principle of completion and harmony is achieved only through cultivation.

To grasp the reins of the people yet worry over their deaths is to fail to treat all things as straw dogs. Forget the state, and the self is enriched; forget power, and virtue is filled.

As Zhao Zhu notes: Aitai Tu was Confucius in wordless form—when Confucius returned from Wei to Lu, his appearance was so repulsive that it was said, “Wei has an ugly man.” Men who dwelt with him longed to stay; this illustrates how lords revered him. Women wished to be his concubines; this illustrates how disciples followed him.

And harmony without leading, delusion without creation. The lord’s position gathers emoluments—this illustrates how the Dao succors all under Heaven to become an unadorned king. Knowledge does not extend beyond the realm; male and female unite before one’s eyes. What one knows does not surpass the commonplace of daily use; what one sees does not exceed the ignorance of husband and wife. Yet how does this differ from others?

Duke Ai cast aside form to embrace virtue, entrusting him with state governance, yet soon departed. Confucius compared him to a piglet suckling a dead mother—after a moment, it senses it is not of its kind and abandons her to flee. When the roasted meat did not arrive, Confucius left without doffing his ceremonial cap. Could he have done otherwise?

A warrior who dies in battle is as useless as an ornament on a coffin—just as a man with amputated feet has no use for shoes. The newly wed concubine further illustrates how talent is complete and virtue remains unmanifest.

The sixteen transformations—life and death, extreme cold and heat—are inescapable to all. They cycle day and night, their beginning and end beyond reckoning, yet they cannot disrupt the harmony of one’s Heaven-given nature. Entering the square inch of the heart, it brims with joy, and all things become spring. When encountering the moment of generation, response follows naturally.

The fullness of still water is what all under Heaven takes as its model. Virtue cultivated achieves harmony; in harmony, one merges with things. When virtue departs from things, it takes form; once formed, it is no longer virtue.

This is why Duke Ai called Confucius a "friend in virtue." Yuanzhai notes: "Knowledge does not extend beyond the four realms"—what one knows does not transcend the world. "Male and female unite before one’s eyes" means intimacy with things, akin to the idea of birds at the shore taking no alarm. The piglet’s analogy shows that human love and aversion do not depend on the beauty or ugliness of form.

A warrior who dies in battle is not mourned with ritual ornaments—just as a man with amputated feet has no use for shoes. This clarifies that virtue resides within, not without. The concubine, untrimmed nails, and unpierced ears all honor the integrity of form, eschewing adornment. The newly wed are exempt from service, as recorded in the *Rites*—this analogy illustrates the integrity of virtue.

Life and death, prosperity and ruin, changing circumstances, and the course of fate alternate before us day and night. Though the wise cannot trace their origins, they do not disturb the harmony within the breast. They do not enter the numinous storehouse, nor do they unsettle the heart.

Day and night without ceasing—this speaks of ceaseless renewal, becoming spring with all things, finding joy in every encounter. "Encountering the moment of generation in the heart" means response (encounter) and timeliness (the mean of the moment), adapting to what is felt in each situation.

"Talent complete" refers to the integrity of one’s nature. "Virtue unmanifest" means no display of merit. Inner preservation ensures outer stability—this describes how the levelness of water serves as a model.

The completion of harmony within one’s nature is the cultivation of virtue. When virtue remains unmanifest, there is nowhere it is not present, so things cannot depart from it.

This is not a lord-minister relationship but merely a "friend in virtue," akin to Mencius’ notion of "befriending."

Note: The meaning of "male and female" has varied interpretations. Some, following *Liezi*, take it as referring to birds and beasts—"male and female before one’s eyes, breeding in flocks along the Way." Yet considering the passage’s words—"men who dwelt with him longed to stay; women wished to be his concubines"—"male and female unite before one’s eyes" likely means that both men and women flocked to him.

As for those who die in battle, their burial does not employ *ying* ornaments. The traditional reading takes *zi* (资) as "use" or "offering," but some omit it entirely, leading to confusion. Later, the lecturer Wu Yin adopted the reading "without *ying*," which clarifies the text and aligns with the principle.

Further examination of the *Rites* (*Tan Gong* chapter) reveals: The Zhou placed *ying* ornaments; in Confucius’ funeral, they adorned the coffin walls with *ying* and set up mourning garments with *ying*. *Jiao* (绞) is pronounced *yao*; *qi* (萋) is pronounced *liu*. The *Rites of Zhou* writes it as *liuying*. The *Mingtang Position* states: "The Zhou’s *biyi* ornaments." Zheng’s commentary: The Son of Heaven’s eight *ying* all bear jade and hang feathers; feudal lords’ six *ying* bear *gui* tablets; great officers’ four *ying*; and scholars’ two *ying* bear *ai* caps with cords. From this, it is clear that *ying* were commonly used in ancient funeral rites, not solely as martial adornments.

Nanhua’s original intent was that the sages established rites to ensure people could nurture life and send off the dead without regret. The Zhou used bronze coffins adorned with *liuying*, with distinctions in rank and elaboration to suit each station—this was to honor the end of life. But those who die in battle do not meet a proper fate and have failed in the Way of warfare. Thus, their burial does not employ *ying*. If even their form cannot be preserved intact, how can one expect full ritual observance? It is like a man with amputated feet having no use for shoes.

This chapter, beginning with the analogy of the piglet suckling its dead mother and reiterating it here, merely illustrates that when virtue is full within, no external aid is needed; when virtue is lacking within, external adornment is of no benefit.

"Becoming spring with all things" is to "encounter the moment of generation in the heart." Those whose talent is complete and virtue unmanifest harbor perfect harmony within, engaging with things without barrier, like the spreading of spring’s warmth, bestowing the grace of life everywhere. With no deliberate intent, they respond to every stimulus.

Master Lianxi’s words—"not removing the grass before the window, for it shares the same mind as myself"—express this same idea.

Someone asked: When there is no stimulus or encounter, where does harmony reside? The answer: Like music suspended in the air, sound does not hide.

*Collected Exegeses on the Ocean of Meanings in the True Classic of Nanhua, Volume Thirteen*

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin on *"Virtue’s Overflowing Power" (Chapter Three)*

When the hunchbacked man without lips spoke to Duke Ling of Wei, the duke delighted in him; yet when he beheld whole men, their necks seemed to him mere stumps. When the jar-shaped man with emaciated limbs spoke to Duke Huan of Qi, the duke delighted in him; yet when he beheld whole men, their necks seemed to him mere stumps. Thus, when virtue excels, form is forgotten. If men forget what ought to be forgotten yet remember what ought not to be remembered, this is called *true forgetting*.

Therefore, the sage wanders freely, yet knowledge becomes a snare, covenants become glue, virtue becomes a bond, and craft becomes commerce. The sage does not scheme—what need has he for knowledge? He does not sever—what need has he for glue? He suffers no loss—what need has he for virtue? He does not traffic—what need has he for commerce? These four are the *fast of Heaven*; the fast of Heaven is the *nourishment of Heaven*. Having received sustenance from Heaven, what need has he for man?

One may possess the form of a man yet lack the passions of men. Possessing the form of a man, one mingles with men; lacking the passions of men, right and wrong do not cling to one’s person. How slight and small—this is what binds one to men! How vast and great—this alone completes one’s Heaven!

Huizi said to Zhuangzi: "Do men truly have no passions?"
Zhuangzi replied: "Indeed."
Huizi said: "If a man has no passions, how can he be called a man?"
Zhuangzi said: "The Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form—how can he not be called a man?"
Huizi said: "If he is called a man, how can he have no passions?"
Zhuangzi said: "This is not what I mean by passions. What I call *no passions* means that men do not inwardly harm their bodies with likes and dislikes, but constantly follow nature without augmenting life."
Huizi said: "If one does not augment life, how can one preserve one’s body?"
Zhuangzi said: "The Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form—do not inwardly harm your body with likes and dislikes. Now you strain your spirit outward, exhaust your essence, lean against a tree to chant, and recline upon a withered catalpa to sleep. Heaven chose your form, yet you clamor about *hardness and whiteness*."

Guo’s commentary: When one’s virtue excels in compliance with things, things forget their ugliness; when it excels in resistance to things, things forget their beauty. Virtue is what the world does not forget, while form is what principle does not retain—thus, to forget form is not true forgetting, but to forget virtue is *true forgetting*. To wander in the realm of self-attainment, to let go and reach everywhere—this is the completeness of talent and virtue. The four—knowledge, covenants, virtue, and craft—arise naturally from one another, their principles already inherent. Thus, the sage has no use for his own contrivance. Things are not random; all follow the course of supreme principle—one need only yield to it.

Sharing the form of men yet hollow as withered wood, one is vast and unobstructed, nothing unendurable, and so alone completes one’s Heaven. If man is not born of passion, how can life be known by passion? Huizi did not grasp that form and appearance are not passion, yet pressed further. Zhuangzi said: If right and wrong are taken as passion, then one without right and wrong or likes and dislikes, though possessing form and appearance, is merely a man—where then would passion reside? Not to harm the body with likes and dislikes, to proceed directly as circumstances demand—this is not passion. To follow nature without augmenting life is to rest in what is fitting.

Huizi still did not understand that life arises of itself, that principle is self-sufficient. Zhuangzi further explained that the principles of life are self-sufficient within form and appearance; yield to them, and they endure of themselves—passions of likes and dislikes only suffice to harm oneself. "Leaning against a tree, reclining upon a catalpa"—this describes the self-entrapment of those with passions, the passions of this world. To say "Heaven chose" makes clear that passion is not born of passion—how much less anything else!

Lü’s commentary: The lipless man and the emaciated cripple, by virtue of their excellence, were esteemed by the two rulers, for their forms were forgotten. Men do not know to preserve their spirit—what they forget is enslaved to sight and sound, thought and deliberation, which they do not forget. To forget what ought to be forgotten yet remember what ought not to be remembered—this is *true forgetting*. It is not merely that form is forgotten; in true forgetting, the sage’s wanderings are such that things cannot pursue him, yet all are preserved.

Thus, to treat knowledge as a snare—snares are not the trunk of the tree; to treat covenants as glue—glue is for binding what is scattered; to treat virtue as a bond—bonds are for joining disparate bodies; to treat craft as commerce—commerce is not for making vessels. The sage does not scheme—what need has he for knowledge? He does not sever—what need has he for glue? He suffers no loss—what need has he for virtue? He does not traffic—what need has he for commerce? These four are the *constant of Heaven*, thus requiring nothing from without.

Possessing the form of a man yet lacking the passions of men—this is because his wanderings lie in *true forgetting*. Mingling with men, he wanders among worldly customs; right and wrong do not cling to his person, so he rests in the evenness of Heaven. In his smallness, he belongs to men; in his greatness, he belongs to Heaven. In appearance, his movements and demeanor are none other than the Dao; in form, his six limbs and nine orifices are born of Heaven—what is needed to be a man is complete. Why doubt that he cannot be without passion?

Huizi simply took "no passion" to mean like wood or stone, unfit to be called a man. Zhuangzi said: What I call passion is that right and wrong do not cling to one’s person. What I call *no passion* is not to inwardly harm one’s body with likes and dislikes. If so, this suffices to preserve one’s body—why augment life? Huizi did not know that movement and stillness are one, yet sought stillness by reclining upon a catalpa. Not understanding this, he failed to grasp that his form was chosen by Heaven, yet clamored about *hardness and whiteness*.

Lin’s commentary: Form is what the world does not forget; virtue is what the world forgets. If a man can forget what the world does not forget and remember what the world forgets, then his talent and virtue are complete—this is *true forgetting*. The wanderings of the sage, as *Liezi* says, are to observe what changes, the ultimate in wandering. Knowledge is the source of schemes, hence a snare. Covenants bind things, hence glue.

Virtue perfected within responds to things without—thus it is called "engagement."
The craftsman fashions tools to seek profit—thus it is called "trade."
These four—engagement, trade, schemes, and bonds—are what the world pursues,
yet the sage neither plans nor severs, neither loses nor traffics. What need has he for these four?

Though these four belong to human affairs, they are also how Heaven nourishes mankind.
Having received sustenance from Heaven, why resort to human contrivance?

The sage’s form is the same as others’, so he mingles among men;
his nature differs from others’, so right and wrong do not adhere to him.
His form is slight, thus he belongs to man;
his nature is vast, thus he fulfills Heaven.

Huizi understood this nature but not its source.
Zhuangzi spoke of not inwardly harming the body with likes and dislikes—
this, in accord with the nature of life and destiny, is how one fulfills Heaven.
The passions of likes and dislikes respond to things, yet the self has no part in them.
Not augmenting life, one exhausts life’s principles without imposing one’s passions.
The Dao’s countenance and Heaven’s form remain unharmed by likes and dislikes—
this suffices to preserve one’s body.

Now you strain your spirit and weary your essence,
leaning against trees and reclining upon catalpa—
all these are the burdens of passion.
Heaven chose your form to wander uniquely among things,
yet you augment life and confuse the multitude,
like Gongsun Long’s wrangling over hardness and whiteness,
able to silence men’s mouths but not win their hearts.
This is to misunderstand the nature of life and destiny,
and be enslaved by creation.

*Detailed Commentary on the Dao*:
The sage’s Dao has no fixed direction, yet is nowhere absent;
it has no form, yet nothing it does not become.
Thus his mind finds no destination that is not wandering.
Wandering is the name for carefree roaming, unbound by attachments.
The question "What need for schemes, bonds, virtue, or trade?"
refers to what he wanders beyond.
Schemes arise from planning, bonds from covenants,
virtue from loss, craft from profit—
these four are the world’s means of mutual sustenance.
The man of full virtue has no use for them; he relies on Heaven’s nourishment alone.

The sage’s form is the same as others’, thus he seems slight in smallness;
his nature differs from others’, thus he alone fulfills Heaven.
The sage is not without passion—
his likes arise from non-disliking, his dislikes from non-liking.
Following what is naturally so without augmenting life,
this may be called "without passion."
Man’s life: his form is chosen by Heaven, his nature endowed beyond things.
His virtue is never unfilled—
only when entangled by things is it harmed.
Remove the harm, and virtue is full.

Huizi’s excessive speech was his greatest harm,
so this chapter ends by refuting him.

*Bixu’s Commentary*:
Between these two masters, their discourse forgets form but not yet virtue.
The sage wanders beyond the realm of intent, form, and forgotten virtue,
though in daily use he employs knowledge and virtue without self-importance.
Thus schemes and bonds never arise.
Without planning gain or harm, what need for schemes?
Without severing nature and passion, what need for bonds?
Without loss among things, what need for virtue?
Without amassing goods, what need for trade?
These four are how the myriad things are nourished by Heaven.

The dung beetle rolls its ninefold ball, the spider weaves its web—
this is unplanned knowledge.
Clouds and dragons, wind and tigers, pines and cypresses, dodder and mistletoe—
this is unsevered bonding.
Birds and beasts in forests and marshes, fish and turtles in rivers and lakes—
this is virtue without loss.
Each thing seeks its own advantage, each tends its own life—
this is trade without commerce.
This is Heaven’s nourishment, thus called "Heaven’s sustenance."
With form but no passion, one resembles a wooden rooster.

Faces a foot wide differ in appearance—this is the Dao’s gift.
Bodies six feet tall, empty sacks with no distinction—this is Heaven’s gift.
Neither belongs to passion.
Heaven entrusts you with form—how could it be passionate?
It merely ferments and arises of itself.

Now you possess a human form no different from others,
yet forcefully clamor about hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference before the multitude,
proclaiming yourself wise—
like smelted metal leaping from the furnace, how could it not seem strange?

*Zhao’s Commentary*:
Without lips or with great deformity, their ugliness is evident,
yet these two masters delighted in them and saw them as whole—
forgetting their forms and cherishing their virtue.
That form’s ugliness can be forgotten while the world forgets it not,
and virtue’s unforgettability is forgotten by the world—
this is true forgetting.

The sage wanders in this world,
fearing knowledge may lead to deceit, so establishes covenants to secure it;
fearing virtue insufficient to reach others, teaches trade to exchange goods,
amassing the world’s wealth.
Yet what makes the sage a sage is the absence of these four.
Thus he neither plans, nor severs, nor loses, nor traffics.

Slight in smallness—this is form.
Vast in greatness—this is virtue.

Huizi still doubted how one without passion could be human.
The answer: "When I speak of being without passion,
I mean not inwardly harming the body with likes and dislikes."
This was a direct pointer, yet Huizi still raised objections.
Zhuangzi warned him: "Master, you strain your spirit and weary your essence—
how exhausting your labor!
If one day your form were reclaimed by Heaven,
could you still prattle on with hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference?"

*The Oral Teachings of Yongzhai*:
Virtue has its excellence, form its forgettability.
To love virtue and forget form—
the world knows form but not virtue; this is true forgetting.
When the sage wanders, his mind wanders in Heaven.
Knowledge is for handling affairs, bonds for restraining the self—
engaging outwardly while forgetting inwardly.
Merchants sell their reputations to the world.
With the mind wandering in Heaven, these four become burdens—
thus he has no use for them.
"Heaven’s sustenance" is like "Heaven’s nobility."

Virtue and knowledge, previously praised, are here deemed harmful—
the brush dances freely, with some lapses in consistency.

"Having a human form" and what follows are Zhuangzi’s common expressions,
which Huizi questioned.

*The Oral Teachings of Yongzhai*:

Heaven bestows form—it is a thing. The Dao bestows appearance—things must have their patterns. What I call "having no emotions" is to forget likes and dislikes and not be harmed, to follow nature and not augment it. Now, Master Hui exhausts his spirit and wearies his essence in debates over "hard and white" and "sameness and difference." Yet Heaven granted you this form—why torment yourself so? Where virtue excels, delight lies in virtue, not in appearance. Where form is forgotten, one discards appearance to unite with the heart. This is how these two scholars were known by their lords, and how their lords were praised by later generations.

The sage’s wanderings do not depart from the human world. Leisurely and carefree, he observes its changes, walking without relying on his feet, seeing without relying on his eyes. Thus, things do not chase after form, nor do people flee from their emotions, yet his concern for the world never leaves his heart for a single day. Fame and reputation are demonic entanglements that disturb the nature; to treat them as wisdom gives rise to demands and deceit. The simplicity of knotted cords arose from the scattering of primal integrity, yet clinging to them like glue breeds fraud and falsehood. Artisans craft tools to serve needs, but when trade turns to commerce, cunning and deceit emerge. These are the corruptions of the age.

The true person still hopes to reverse them, declaring: "Without scheming, what use is knowledge? Without novelty, what use is glue? Without loss, what use is virtue? Without goods, what use is commerce?" His words strike deeply. This is the essential path of returning to purity and simplicity. Even if the sage were to reappear, he would not alter this teaching. If one could shed the burdens of glue-like attachments and demonic entanglements, one would become a companion of Heaven—how could the decay of the world reach them?

"Having a human form," one shares the same eating, drinking, and daily life as others; "having no human emotions," right and wrong, likes and dislikes do not stir within. How small this form is in the vastness of Heaven and Earth! How great this virtue is in the depths of human nature! With one’s own nature, one restores one’s own spontaneity—what need is there for others?

The Dao bestows appearance—whether beautiful or ugly, one accepts it. Heaven bestows form—whether long-lived or short-lived, one preserves it whole. Always following nature without augmenting life, knowing that non-augmentation means no harm, where then can emotions find a foothold?

Now, Master Hui does not cultivate the inner fullness of virtue but merely seeks to align with the world’s sentiments through verbal debate. Thus, he exhausts his spirit outwardly and wearies his essence, leaning on his armrest with closed eyes—his knowledge and abilities have enslaved him, and he is utterly worn out! I tell him: Heaven selected your form to be the spirit of the myriad things—was it merely so you could clamor about "hard and white" among men? Ascend by degrees to the mysteries of nature and destiny, the profundities of virtue and the Dao, and you may yet approach the sagely and the divine.

How pitiful that Master Hui is burdened by talent and drowned in debate, blind to his nature and confused by his emotions! This is the great flaw of scholars: losing virtue through knowledge. They fail to realize that human emotions are originally free of likes and dislikes—likes and dislikes arise from things. When emotions and things are forgotten, both are transformed. Always following nature without augmenting life—this is the emotion of having no emotions. What need is there for debate?

If Master Hui were to suddenly awaken, return to purity and simplicity, and advance beyond knowledge, his virtue could be fulfilled and his nature restored. Why then would he worry about failing to connect with others or respond to things? That by which things are given life is called virtue—it is Heaven’s pure and perfect endowment, the means by which form is completed and life honored. By cultivating it, one may come to hear of the nature and the Dao of Heaven.

Virtue originates in Heaven, but its fulfillment lies with man—how can one not cherish and esteem it? The resonance of things is but a minor response, a sign of virtue’s fulfillment. To verify its great achievement, there are those who assist Heaven and Earth, aiding transformation and nurturance. Thus, Wang Tai inspired Confucius’s respect, and if he wished to lead the world to follow him, his cultivation must have surpassed others. Without teaching or discourse, learners came empty and left full—unless one’s heart connected with hearts, death and life held no change, and one commanded things while transformation flowed from oneself, how could this be achieved?

Seeing unity and forgetting loss reveals how the attainer of the Dao forgets form. Only stillness can still all stillness, showing how emptiness serves as a mirror. These are the ways to fulfill virtue. When virtue is full, things turn to it, like pines and cypresses among the common trees, like Yao and Shun among the people. Is it merely good fortune to rightly order one’s own life? The true fortune lies in rightly ordering all beings, while one’s own life and death, fortune and misfortune are not clung to as trifles. Thus, choosing the day to ascend or depart rests with oneself—how could one be troubled by things?

Shentu Wujue endured mutilation and sought further amputation, seeing amputation as wholeness. Zichan, despite his noble position in governance, was arrogant toward the amputated—though noble, he was base. Without toes, one’s honor lies in what remains, and what remains is weightier than feet. When Heaven’s punishment cannot be undone, accepting one’s fate makes one no different from the whole. When Aichi saw the male and female rhinoceroses before him, he made Duke Ai forget his revulsion and wish to entrust him with the state. This was not love for his form, but love for what gave his form meaning.

Thus, when supreme harmony operates within, flaws and illnesses vanish without. Virtue renews daily, the Dao flows through spiritual transformation. Things are accomplished without claiming merit, and wherever one goes, things turn to them. Duke Ai befriended Confucius—his virtue was honored, and his rank could be forgotten. Duke Ling saw Wushen as whole—his virtue was honored, and his form could be forgotten.

The sage’s wanderings have no boundary with things. How vast! Alone, he completes his Heaven. He forgets what others cannot forget, and the pure and perfect naturally turn to him without refusal. Master Hui was rich in talent but poor in virtue, so he asked about the emotions of likes and dislikes. The answer addressed the emotions of nature and destiny, deeply correcting his error: let the Dao’s appearance and Heaven’s form not be harmed by likes and dislikes. Having form but no emotions, always following nature—thus virtue is fulfilled and things resonate, self and other both vanish. Right and wrong, likes and dislikes are transformed in wordless forgetting. What need is there to exhaust spirit and essence in clamoring over "hard and white"?

The Supreme One states: Supreme Virtue, Perfect Virtue, Vast Virtue, and Mysterious Virtue—all are the fullness of virtue. Goodness binds without cords, and the world will naturally submit; unsummoned, it comes of itself. To hold virtue is to grasp the tally—all are called "correspondence." Yet *Nanhua* expounds this in even greater detail, even taking the maimed, the crippled, and the repulsive as the basis of its discourse, thereby serving as a warning to those who esteem form and outward appearance over inner virtue.

**Inner Chapters: The Teacher of Heaven #1**

To know what Heaven does and to know what man does—this is perfection.
To know what Heaven does is to be born of Heaven;
To know what man does is to nourish what his knowledge knows with what his knowledge does not know, so that he completes his Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this is the fullness of knowledge.
Yet there is a danger.
Not knowing that one must await something before acting rightly, and what one awaits remains uncertain.
How can we be sure that what I call Heaven is not man, or that what I call man is not Heaven?
Only after there is a true person is there true knowledge.

What is a true person?
The true persons of old did not resist the few, did not dominate success, did not scheme with scholars.
Those who are thus do not regret their errors nor take pride in their rightness.
Those who are thus climb high without fear, enter water without getting wet, enter fire without feeling heat—such is the knowledge that ascends to the Dao in this way.

Guo Xiang’s commentary:
To know what Heaven does is to know that all is natural; thus one inwardly releases the self and outwardly merges with things, following them so that nothing is left undone.
What acts cannot act, yet action acts of itself.
What knows cannot know, yet knowledge knows of itself.
The true person abandons knowledge yet knows, does not act yet acts, lives by nature, and attains through sitting in forgetfulness.
Thus knowledge is called "cut off," and the name of action departs.

Man’s life depends on all that Heaven and Earth possess, and not a day can be without them.
Yet what the body possesses, knowledge may or may not know;
What principle holds, action may or may not perform.
What knowledge knows is little; what the body possesses is much.
What action does is few; what principle holds is vast.
What men know need not be the same, yet what they do dare not differ—if it differs, falsity arises and truth is lost.
Knowing that what man does has its hidden limits, one follows without forcing;
Knowing that what man knows has its bounds, one employs without excess.
Within the unity of the self, knowledge and unknowing meet and join.
Measuring by the fullness of knowledge, yet leaving the unknown to knowledge and entrusting it to Heaven—this still involves awaiting.
If one entrusts life to Heaven, then encountering things is fitting.
Our life has its limit—this is Heaven.
To seek to extend it—this is man.
Man is none other than Heaven; order and chaos, success and failure are all natural.
Only after there is a true person does all knowledge in the world attain its truth.
Not resisting the few, one follows the many.
Not dominating success, one does not rely on action; the mind roams freely, and the scholar preserves himself without scheming to reach it.
He simply preserves himself rightly without error,
Not weighing gain and loss in his heart.
This speaks of ascending to the Dao so far.

Lu Huiqing’s commentary:
To know what Heaven does is to know that what gives us life is Heaven—nothing acts, and man has no part in it; it is what knowledge cannot know.
What knowledge can know is what man does, so one nourishes what knowledge does not know with what it does know, using knowledge to nourish life rather than letting life follow knowledge.
Thus one can fulfill one’s years without dying prematurely. What the world calls the fullness of knowledge goes no further than this.
Yet it is not free from exhaustion, for what is called knowing Heaven and knowing man must await knowledge to be fitting. Knowledge is not the true Dao, yet one awaits it to be fitting—what one awaits is fundamentally uncertain. How then can we be sure that what I previously called Heaven is not man, or that what I called man is not Heaven?
Only the true person has true knowledge, knowing with what does not know and thus having nothing to await.

The world’s rights and wrongs are not uniform, so one simply follows the multitude.
Following the multitude, one cannot avoid resisting the few.
The way of Earth has no success yet takes turns in completion; rigidity cannot avoid dominating success.
Consulting and scheming with others cannot avoid plotting with scholars—these are all the sage’s responses to the world, not his truth.
The true person embodies pure simplicity without self, so though he errs, he cannot but err—what regret can there be?
Though he is right, he cannot but be right—what pride can there be?
If this is so, then climbing high is what I do—whom should I fear?
Water and fire are also what I do—whom should I wet or burn?
Knowledge is not the Dao, yet the true person’s true knowledge can ascend to the Dao in this way.

Lin Yidu’s commentary:
What Heaven does, man does not know, yet he must nourish it with man’s knowledge.
Within the self, what lies within the body, I do not know;
What lies beyond the body, I use to nourish what I do not know.
Thought has form; thoughtlessness leaves no trace. Now, using the thought that has form to think of thoughtlessness—thus it is clear that knowledge nourishes the unknown.
What knowledge nourishes is slight, yet the unknown does not escape its nourishment—hence it is called "full."
Though knowledge is full, it is not free from exhaustion, for it still awaits to be fitting.
Having something to await means uncertainty. Forgetting both knowledge and unknowing, how can there still be anything to await?
How can we be sure that what I call Heaven is not man, or that what I call man is not Heaven?
Only by not resisting the few do the many thus follow.

Not striving to dominate success, the many thus place him first;
Not scheming for followers, the many thus turn to him.
Whether he errs or acts rightly, principle accords with what is fitting—what regret or gain could there be?
One who is thus ascends heights without trembling, enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning. This is the most wondrous principle, attainable only by the true person—such is the knowledge that ascends to merge with the Dao.

Chen Xiangdao’s note:
To know what Heaven does is destiny;
To know what man does is righteousness.
Knowing Heaven but not man is to discard righteousness for destiny;
Knowing man but not Heaven is to discard destiny for righteousness.
Both are but one-sided aspects of the Dao, not its ultimate state.
Nourishing the unknown with what is known, his life is simply spontaneous.
What man does must rely on what nourishes it to be achieved.
Knowledge is not the Dao; relying on it to enter the Dao still requires awaiting what is fitting.
Knowing what Heaven does, what is awaited is Heaven—though fitting with Heaven, he knows not of man.
Knowing what man does, what is awaited is man—though fitting with man, he knows not of Heaven.
What is awaited remains uncertain; what is known cannot be without bias—this is not true knowledge.
The true person, in knowledge, harbors no expectations, thus does not resist the few;
In action, does not strive for dominance, thus does not force success;
In reliance, has nothing to await, thus does not scheme for followers.
One who is thus may err in governing the world, yet I know not why he errs;
May act rightly in following principle, yet I know not why he acts rightly.
Unaware of what is high, he ascends without trembling;
Unaware of water or fire, he enters without drowning or burning.
Such is the knowledge that ascends to merge with the Dao.

Chen Bixu’s note:
What Heaven does is to send down pure and wondrous qi, covering and nurturing the myriad things;
What man does is to move the spirit’s harmonious qi, nourishing and protecting the hundred bones.
To know that Heaven’s non-action is not emptiness, and man’s action is not stagnation—this is the ultimate.
The pure and wondrous qi, unaware of whence it comes, is called "solitary transformation."
Solitary transformation is spontaneous arising.
What knowledge knows is finite knowledge;
What knowledge does not know is infinite knowledge.
Nourishing infinite knowledge with finite knowledge, without overstepping bounds to seek understanding—this is the fullness of knowledge.
Yet it still rests in awaiting what is fitting, so better to forget all and entrust it.
The opposition of boundaries remains uncertain—how can we be sure that what I call natural is not human, or that what I call human is not natural?
One who is thus, with mind submerged in emptiness, traces merged with the dust of clamor, ascends into the great void, vast and boundless.

Wang Xiu’s note:
All who possess knowledge use it to harm life.
Only those who study the Dao keep knowledge within the Dao.
Keeping knowledge within the Dao is to nourish the unknown and thus ascend to merge with the Dao.

Zhao Xuzhai’s note:
What Heaven does arises spontaneously—this is what knowledge does not know.
What man does arises from compulsion—this is what knowledge knows.
Nourishing what knowledge does not know with what it knows is to know Heaven through knowing man, to serve Heaven through knowing Heaven.
One may fulfill destiny without misfortune or premature death, yet still face calamity.
The changes of life and death cannot be foreseen; having something to await means uncertainty.
But one who does not recognize or know, following the Emperor’s decree—dying at dusk after hearing the Way at dawn—what does he await?
The *Mencius*’ "Exhausting the Mind" chapter elucidates this principle.
*The Ordinary Studio’s Oral Teachings* states: When human affairs are exhausted, Heaven’s principle appears—thus he nourishes what knowledge does not know with what it knows.
Knowledge lies within me, but what is awaited lies without.
Sometimes one obtains without seeking, sometimes only obtains through seeking—neither can be certain.
If one says it comes from Heaven, one must seek to obtain it;
If one says it comes from man, there are things one seeks yet does not obtain.
How can we be sure that what I call Heaven is not man, or that what I call man is not Heaven?
Only with the true person does true knowledge arise—this speaks of one who possesses the Dao.
The few are insufficient; when in times of insufficiency, even if success comes, one does not boast or dominate.
"Scholars" refers to those of the same endeavor.
The *Shu Mountain* poem says: Do not act as a scholar with a tally—act without intention.
Thus, one does not regret failure nor rejoice in success, entrusting all to spontaneity.
Not trembling, not drowning, not burning—this is the meaning of "no entry without self-attainment."
"Ascending to merge" means profound attainment.

Chu Shi’s *Insights* states:
Knowing oneself to know others, knowing others to know Heaven—this is the proper path of knowledge.
Heaven is fundamentally non-active; when speaking of what Heaven does, it refers to the movement of the sun, moon, and stars, the progression of yin and yang, cold and heat.
What man does refers to the manifestation of good and evil, compliance and rebellion, the formation of fortune and misfortune, gain and loss.
Having known this, one nourishes what knowledge does not know with what it knows.
"What is known" refers to what knowledge reaches—human affairs that can be anticipated, Heaven’s principles that can be deduced.
"What is not known" refers to what is beyond knowledge, beyond anticipation, beyond calculation—dim, obscure, and numinous, like spirits and gods.
Fulfilling one’s natural lifespan without premature death—this speaks only of knowing man, hence it is called the fullness of knowledge.
Yet it still awaits knowledge to be fitting, so what is awaited remains uncertain.
How can we be sure that what I call Heaven is not man, or that what I call man is not Heaven?
The fusion of Heaven and man is true knowledge.
The *Qi Wu Lun* says: "Knowledge stops at what it does not know." This is it.
"The few" refers to times of poverty and constraint; "success" alludes to times of abundance.
Not trembling, not drowning, not burning—this is the meaning of "no entry without self-attainment."
"Ascending to merge" means profound attainment.

In times of constraint, one must yield—resistance harms life.
In times of abundance, one must remain humble—arrogance invites disaster.
The conduct of the *mosheng* (exemplary person), when illustrated through affairs, carries profound meaning—precisely what the classics call "no deliberation, no premeditation."
In such a state, interactions with the world may occasionally exceed what circumstances demand, yet this is merely happenstance—what regret could there be?
When circumstances themselves are happenstance, what self-satisfaction could arise?
It is like a drifting tile or an empty boat: without intent to encounter things, things do not resent them.
Thus, ascending heights—what is there to fear?
Entering water—what is there to drown in?
Entering fire—what is there to burn?
If even those who ascend to the Dao through knowledge are like this, how much more so those who forget knowledge and attain sudden awakening?

The true person of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry, ate without relishing flavor, and breathed deeply.
The true person’s breath rose from the heels, while the breath of ordinary people rose only from the throat.
Those who are cramped and submissive speak as if choking.
The deeper one’s cravings, the shallower one’s heavenly mechanism.

The true person of old did not delight in life nor detest death.
They emerged without joy, returned without resistance—
gone in a flash, come in a fleeting moment, nothing more.
They did not forget their origin nor seek their end.
They received and rejoiced, forgot and returned—
this is called not abandoning the Dao with the heart, not aiding Heaven with human effort.
This is the true person.

Guo’s commentary:
Sleeping without dreaming means having no mental constructs.
Waking without worry means accepting whatever comes.
Eating without relishing flavor means eating as a matter of course.
The true person’s breath rises from the heels, coming from the very root.
Choked speech arises from uneven qi—only when the root is deeply settled and utterly still does one return to unity, free of desire, embodying transformation, at ease and unforced.
Thus, coming and going present no difficulty; all beginnings and endings, all changes, are forgotten.
How could one who has even forgotten life still seek the meaning of death?
Whatever is received, they meet without resistance.
When things ceaselessly stir the heart and people recklessly pursue them, the heavenly principle is extinguished.
The true person, knowing how to use the heart, does not act thus.
To aid Heaven is to harm it.

Wu’s commentary:
Without deliberation, one sleeps without dreaming.
Without cravings, one eats without relishing flavor, and thus breathes deeply from the heels.
The heel is the origin of qi, the source of breath.
The body’s heel is the foot; the breath’s heel is its point of origin—both are spoken of as the lowest.
Deeper and deeper still—ordinary people lose their grounding and become cramped and submissive.
Their speech chokes as if gagging—how could they breathe from the heels?
Their heavenly mechanism is shallow, stirred by the slightest touch.
But when breath rises from the heels, one is far removed from things.

Those who delight in life, abhor death, rejoice in emergence, and resist return—abandoning what they call "tranquility"—are those who discard the Dao with their hearts. Their attachments reach their end, yet they cannot joyfully accept it, forget and return to it. They obscure the natural and thereby augment life—this is how people assist Heaven.

Yi Du’s commentary:
The true person sleeps at night and awakens at dawn, no different from others. Yet they do not dream and are without sorrow—this sets them apart. When the heart dances with thought, the hun-spirit remains at ease and does not wander among things; thus, their sleep is dreamless. When the form is without contrivance, the shen-spirit remains at rest and is not enslaved by things; thus, their waking is without care. Their food is not savored, as if they do not eat at all. Their breath is deep and profound, for the true person’s qi is stored in the profound and subtle. The heel is the body’s lowest extremity. Qi is concealed in secrecy and does not burst forth externally. Breath enters through the nose, but the heart governs it. Those who are submissive are constrained by others; their qi is broken and bent, so their speech is choked as if gagging. The throat is where food is received. Those deeply mired in cravings have spirits that scatter and awareness that dims. Examining their heavenly mechanism, it resides only above the liver and diaphragm, before the face and eyes—far removed from the root. As *Mencius* says: "Those who are full of desires, though they may preserve something of it, do so but little." This is the case. If one does not know how to delight in life, how can they rejoice in emergence? If one does not know how to abhor death, how can they resist return?

Swift and unobstructed they come and go—only the most spiritually attuned remain unmoved. Not forgetting their origin, they return to their root. Not seeking their end, they entrust it wholly to fate.

While alive, they do not question what comes their way but receive it with joy. When their time comes, they do not ponder where they go but forget and return. This is called not abandoning the Dao with the heart, nor aiding Heaven with human effort.

*Detailed Commentary on the Dao* states: The true person of old slept without their spirit intermingling, thus they had no dreams. When awake, their form remained unopened, thus they knew no sorrow. They tasted flavors yet were not enslaved by taste, so food held no savor. They nurtured directly without depleting their true nature, so their breath was deep. Neither delighting in life nor abhorring death, they entrusted life and death to Heaven. Neither rejoicing in emergence nor resisting return, they entrusted emergence and return to things. Such as these move freely and unobstructed.

Those burdened by things forget their beginning; those chasing profit seek their end. What they receive may not suit them, and their return depends on reflection. Only the true person does not forget their origin but returns to their root, does not seek their end but arrives at fate. Thus, they receive with joy and forget to return. Without thought, they do not abandon the Dao with the heart. Without action, they do not aid Heaven with human effort. This is the true person.

*Green Void’s Commentary* states: One whose spirit is concentrated does not dream. One whose heart is empty knows no sorrow. Without cravings, they find no savor in food. The true person’s fire lies beneath water, so their breath reaches everywhere. The common person’s water and fire contend, thus they find no ultimate peace. Those deeply mired in cravings have shallow heavenly mechanism; when true water is muddied, heavenly light dims. Those who practice the Dao harbor no delight or aversion; those who entrust themselves to fate harbor no joy or resistance. Not forgetting their origin preserves their root; not seeking their end avoids premeditation. Not using the heart to discard the great Dao, not enhancing life to invite misfortune—this is the conduct of the true person.

*Empty Studio’s Commentary* states: Without sleep, without waking, without eating, without breath—this is the true person. Breath emerges from the throat, as all people know. But when deeply asleep, the throat rattles—this is what is meant by "choked speech as if gagging." Delighting in life and abhorring death, rejoicing in emergence and resisting return—this is what is meant by "deep cravings, shallow mechanism." The true person is free of these, thus their comings and goings are unconstrained. Therefore, they do not obscure Heaven’s inherent nature and interact with things endlessly.

Receiving with joy, they are not burdened by life. Forgetting to return, they revert to their root. Not abandoning the Dao with the heart unites heart and Dao. Not aiding Heaven with human effort unites person and Heaven. The true person’s relation to the Heavenly Dao is simply to rest in naturalness.

*Ordinary Studio* says: Their sleep is dreamless—spirit is settled. Their waking is sorrowless—they engage with things without mental conflict. Their food is unsavory, for they seek no satiety. Their breath is profoundly deep—Daoist cultivation truly originates here. When spirit is settled, breath is deep, rising from the heels to the mouth and nose. Without cultivation, the breath of emergence and return stops at the throat. The difference between tranquility and agitation in the body reveals whether one has true insight. Speech confined to the mouth is easily subdued by others—one may observe this in those who question Chan.

Craving is human desire; heavenly mechanism is heavenly principle. Depth and shallowness refer to the measure of their waxing and waning. Each sentence in this passage forms a coherent thread—both Daoist texts and Buddhist scriptures derive from this. From "not knowing how to delight in life" onward, it speaks only of emergence and return. Not forgetting the origin and not seeking the end is the teaching of "tracing origins and embracing endings."

Receiving form from Heaven, how could one not rejoice? Returning it whole, one harbors no attachment. Not abandoning the Dao with the heart means the heart *is* the Dao. Not aiding Heaven with human effort means longevity and early death are fated—human effort adds nothing.

Their sleep is dreamless, like their waking. Their waking is sorrowless, like the Dao. Food is unsavory, thus bland and flavorless. Breath is profoundly deep, thus never leaving its root. The true person’s breath reaches the heels—this is the esoteric teaching of life cultivation. *Nanhua* reveals this principle out of pity for worldly people who chase things and lose their true nature, whose spirit declines and qi dissipates. Many doubt the word "heel," finding it hard to reconcile. It is a metaphor for the body’s lowest extremity. If one seeks within, perceiving the depth of their breath, they will understand what is meant by "heel." The common person’s breath emerges from the throat, as all know. But its origin is the heel. When cravings steam and rise, the double gates become blocked, and breath departs from the heel, unable to return, lingering at the throat. Thus, when slightly oppressed by external things, their qi is bent and constrained, and their speech is choked as if gagging.

The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* says: "Those who lose what they guard speak in a constrained manner." This is all due to deep-seated cravings that harm the heavenly mechanism—it is not that the heavenly mechanism is inherently shallow. Not forgetting the origin is to receive with joy. Not seeking the end is to forget and return. Regarding "not abandoning the Dao with the heart," I suspect "abandon" (*juan*) should be "follow" (*yuan*), meaning to pursue or chase. This aligns with the subsequent phrase "not aiding Heaven with human effort." The *Discourse on Equalizing Things* states: "Not delighting in seeking, not following the Dao," confirming that the sound is preserved but the character is corrupted.

Such a one’s mind is steadfast, their demeanor serene, their forehead broad and full. Chill as autumn, warm as spring, their joy and anger harmonize with the four seasons. They adapt to things without knowing their limit.

Thus, when the sage employs military force, he may overthrow a state yet not lose the people’s hearts. His beneficence extends through ten thousand generations, yet he does not act out of love for others. One who delights in connecting with things is no sage; one who clings to kinship is not truly humane; one who follows the seasons is not a worthy; one who fails to reconcile profit and harm is no gentleman; one who pursues reputation at the cost of self is no scholar; one who sacrifices the self without authenticity is no master of others.

Such as Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—these are servants of others’ service, conforming to others’ conformity without conforming to their own. Guo’s commentary: "Where one dwells, contentment becomes their aspiration." Though they act, they do no harm to stillness. Their broad, full foreheads bear the appearance of great simplicity. Those who embody the Dao and harmonize with change share the same warmth and severity as cold and heat, without intention toward things. Thus, they do not seize what is fitting for things, and nothing is unfitting—hence, none can fathom their limit.

In overthrowing a state, he follows the people’s desire to overthrow it. Warm as the spring sun, those bathed in his grace do not feel gratitude. Chill as autumn frost, those withered by him bear no resentment. The sage takes no delight, yet nothing is obstructed and things flow naturally. He has no kinship, yet by following principle, things sustain themselves. One who relies on the seasons is not as worthy as one who forgets the seasons and naturally aligns with them. Unable to unify the paths of right and wrong, and instead pursuing profit while avoiding harm, one injures virtue and burdens the self.

A true scholar abandons reputation and finds self-possession. Thus, when reputation matches reality, fortune responds to the person. Losing one’s nature and forcing compliance with things brings much servitude—how can one then master others? Like Hu Bujie and Wu Guang, all such figures abandon the self to imitate others, pursuing that which harms the self.

Lü’s commentary: "Their mind and will are set upon the Dao." Serene in demeanor, their spirit congeals, unmoving. With broad, full foreheads, they return to simplicity, free of affectation. Chill as autumn, they harbor no malice. Warm as spring, they hold no attachment. Joy and anger harmonize with the four seasons, aligning with Heaven’s harmony—thus, they accord with things. In overthrowing a state without losing the people’s hearts, they harbor no intent to harm. Extending grace through ten thousand generations without acting out of love, they harbor no intent to love. Toward things, they follow their natural flow. Toward humanity, they forget all under Heaven. Toward the seasons, their conduct and withdrawal lie within themselves.

One who remains steadfast in adversity—what the gentleman guards differs from the common people—is a scholar. One who forgets loftiness and depth, life and death, is a master of others. Thus, from sages and worthies to masters of others, though their ranks differ in honor and baseness, all must possess what is called authenticity to fulfill their names. Like Hu Bujie and Wu Guang, all are servants of others’ service, conforming to others’ conformity without conforming to their own. Only by acting without purpose does one truly conform to one’s own conformity.

Lin’s commentary: "Their mind and will forget the self. Their demeanor forgets things. Their broad foreheads forget form. Chill as autumn—this is the integrity of the perfected. Warm as spring—this is the humanity of the perfected. Joy and anger harmonizing with the four seasons—thus, people, birds, and beasts each find their fitting place. Their spirit leaves no trace; their virtue does not perish—how could there be any limit?"

The sage’s use of military force is not by choice but follows the guilt of the condemned, thus not losing the people’s hearts—this is evident in the deeds of Tang and Wu. The sage’s beneficence is vast in reach and enduring in bestowal, yet he never begins with a heart to love others—this is evident in the heart of Yao and Shun. The sage entrusts things to their natural flow, not delighting in their connection—thus, kinship and distance cannot be imposed, which is the essence of perfect humanity. The worthy’s actions align obscurely with the seasons, not seeking alignment with them. To unify the path of the Dao, one must reconcile profit and harm—deviating from this is no gentleman. Pursuing reputation at the cost of self-cultivation is no scholar. One who masters others stands firm and can employ others; losing one’s nature and feigning for the sake of things brings subjugation—this is no master of others.

Detailed Daoist commentary: "Internally undisturbed, thus their mind and will. Externally unmoved, thus their serene demeanor. Killing is not for might; giving life is not for humanity. Their broad, full foreheads reveal their freedom from the influence of things." The sage’s use of military force follows the people’s desire to overthrow, thus not losing their hearts—this is the utmost of righteousness. Following the people’s desire for benefit, he benefits them without acting out of love—this is the perfection of humanity. Toward things, he connects by not connecting. Toward humanity, he is intimate by not being intimate.

Bound by the seasons, human affairs falter—this is no worthy. Reconciling profit and harm, emotions and deceit multiply—this is no gentleman. Pursuing reputation at the cost of the self—such were Boyi and his like. Sacrificing the self without authenticity—such were Shentu Di and his like.

Bixu’s commentary: "Mind and will are unified. Serene demeanor is reflection. Foreheads broad and unmoving, simple as uncarved wood. Knowing Heaven, they harmonize with the four seasons; knowing man, they accord with things. Forgetting external profit, they gain internal profit. Guarding against internal harm, they distance external harm. Preserving both self and reputation is the mark of a good scholar. Sacrificing the self to follow things brings much servitude—like Hu Bujie and his followers, all are subjugated and lose themselves."

Zhao’s commentary: "Their mind and will—*will* should read *forget*. Their serene demeanor is stillness. Their broad, full foreheads bear the appearance of sincerity. Chill as autumn, warm as spring, they follow the four seasons, accord with things, and none can fathom their limit—wherever they go, all is in harmony. Overthrowing a state without losing the people’s hearts means killing without incurring resentment."

"Bestowing blessings upon all generations without partiality is to benefit without expectation of reward. Those who pursue immediate gains in worldly matters fall short of sagehood. Those who show favoritism to kin fall short of true benevolence. Those who merely adapt to changing times fall short of worthiness. Those who fail to comprehend the interplay of profit and harm fall short of being a noble person. Those who pursue reputation at the cost of their true nature fall short of being a scholar. Those who sacrifice themselves for external things cannot command even the slightest movement—like the followers of Hu Bujie, all lose their true selves in vain.

Yongzhai notes: *Zhi* (志, will) implies a fixed intent with a definite focus. *Kuiran* (頯然) describes a grand appearance. *Qieran* (妻然) signifies anger; *nuanran* (暖然), joy. Without intentional joy or anger, they resemble the four seasons—spring and autumn—adapting to circumstances, each finding its proper place, without a fixed abode. This is what is meant by 'engaging and generating timeliness in the heart.' Waging war to devastate the world or bestowing blessings to cherish it—both are enacted without deliberate intent. Thus, even in the fall of a state, none bear resentment. Those who receive such virtue say, 'The emperor’s power—what is it to me?'

From 'taking joy in understanding things' onward, this passage critiques the so-called sages and worthies to illuminate the unattainable Way of the true person. The term *zhi* (志) has been variously interpreted with strained and inconsistent readings. Zhao’s correction to *wang* (忘, forgetfulness) aligns with the sense of serene demeanor, and his argument is most fitting. The original text likely read thus, with only a minor scribal error. The description of the forehead as *kuiran* resembles Lao Dan emerging from his bath.

From the true persons of ancient times to this portrayal: they are unmoved within by life and death, profit and harm, and thus their outward appearance reflects this. Joy and anger harmonize with the four seasons, merging with the Dao of Heaven. Accord with things merges with the virtue/power of humanity. Who can fathom their limits? Waging war or losing a state without losing the people’s hearts means others forget themselves in relation to me. Bestowing blessings upon all generations without partiality means I forget others in relation to myself.

The sage exhausts their own nature to comprehend the nature of things, ever emerging from spontaneity, not through deliberate effort or joy in understanding. Perfect benevolence has no favorites yet embraces all; the penetrating person is never out of step with the times. The noble person unifies profit and harm, neither avoiding nor seeking, and thus calamity ceases to afflict them arbitrarily. Conduct gives rise to reputation, and reputation manifests conduct. To lose one’s true self is to lack substance—such a one is no scholar. Those who lose themselves in pursuit of falsity are merely enslaved—how can they command others? Only the true person, unenslaved by others and self-sufficient, attains this. *The Ocean of Meanings in the Southern Florescence True Scripture*, Scroll Fourteen, concludes.

[Note: #1 ‘Heaven’ is a scribal error for ‘great.’ #2 Based on the context of the text, this ‘human’ is a scribal error for ‘Heaven.’]

**Chapter Two of the Inner Chapters: The Great and Venerable Master**

The true persons of antiquity bore a countenance of rightness yet formed no cliques, appeared insufficient yet did not defer; they were angular yet not rigid, expansive in their emptiness yet not ostentatious. How radiant their semblance of joy! How towering their inevitability! How vivid their hues that roamed my gaze, how steadfast their power that stilled my virtue! How stern their likeness to the world! How lofty their ungovernability! How continuous their love of seclusion, how forgetful their speech!

They took punishment as their body, ritual as their wings, knowledge as their timing, and virtue as their guide. Taking punishment as their body, they were magnanimous in execution; taking ritual as their wings, they moved through the world; taking knowledge as their timing, they acted only when unavoidable; taking virtue as their guide, they reached the heights with all who had feet—and yet others mistook them for diligent practitioners.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
The true person harmonizes with things without partisanship. They yield without fail to be exalted, appearing insufficient yet not deferring. They wander alone without rigid adherence, vast and unburdened, attaining substance. Joyous and at ease, they seem glad. In motion and stillness, they abide in the utmost necessity, unharmed by things and without forced direction. The perfected person is not stern, yet moves with the world, hence their semblance of sternness. Towering and ungovernable, they are lofty and self-content. Continuous in their love of seclusion, they are profound and far-reaching. Punishment is the body of governance, not of their own making; ritual is the world’s own conduct, not their imposition; knowledge is the movement of the times, not their own doing; virtue is what others follow, not their own creation.

Taking punishment as their body, they entrust governance to its natural course, even in execution remaining lenient. Taking ritual as their wings, they follow the world’s ways, hence nothing is unachievable. The flow of high and low cannot be reversed; the lordship of great and small is an unavoidable tendency. Embracing the confluence of all streams, dwelling at the pinnacle of mastery, they entrust the knowledge of the times to the world’s affairs, yielding to the unfolding of events and consigning all to the realm. The heights are the root of nature; all things are sufficient in their root. Entrusting the flourishing of virtue to its own course, they reach the root with all who have feet. When the root is attained, principle is exhausted.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
The true person bears rightness with things yet forms no cliques. Their abundant virtue seems insufficient, and they do not defer. The sages of old lamented the loss of angularity, but the true person’s angularity remains—adapting to the world, not rigidly bound. Their Way fills the six directions yet never begins with things, yet they dwell in its substance. How luminous their joy! Towering in inevitability, they move only under compulsion. Profound in their hues that roam my gaze, they embrace all things. Steadfast in their power that stills my virtue, they do not lose themselves. What people fear cannot but be feared, hence their stern semblance to the world—yet they remain governable. Towering and vast, they are ungovernable. Continuous in their love of seclusion, they do not commune with things, hence their forgetfulness of speech. All this describes their semblance, not their definable form.

The humane pity execution, for they love; the inhumane delight in it, for they hate. The true person is without love or hate, so how could their execution not be magnanimous? Here their embodied principle is revealed. Mastering oneself and returning to ritual, sight, hearing, speech, and action are all ritual—using it as wings to move through the world. Entering the timeless, how could there be occasion? Things are probed before knowledge arises, hence their unavoidability in affairs. Virtue, like wheel-tracks to follow, allows all with feet to reach the heights with them. The heights are the elevated center of the land. The center cannot but be elevated—this is virtue. All this employs one’s true self; what diligent action is there?

**Lin’s Commentary:**
The true person harmonizes with things without partisanship, their heart seemingly insufficient yet their Way towering above all things. As the *Laozi* says: "Putting oneself last, one advances first; appearing insufficient, one does not defer." In accord with others, angular in independence, yet all may enter—hence they are not rigid. Their Way is expansive, empty yet not ostentatious. Joyful, their countenance shines; towering, they move only under compulsion. Their hues roam without concealment, their power abides in stillness. Only by roaming their power do they seem stern to the world; only by stilling their power are they towering and ungovernable. In the end, they withdraw into seclusion, continuous in their love of closure, forgetting speech in delight. Taking punishment as their body, their execution is like autumn and winter—the natural principle, magnanimous even in killing. Ritual is the flower of virtue, the means of outward conduct, like wings. Taking knowledge as their timing, they follow the natural course of the times, acting only when unavoidable. The heights are the land’s elevation; all with feet may reach them. Taking virtue as their guide is the same. All this is the true person emerging to harmonize with others—how could they ever force their mind?

**Xiang’s Commentary:**
Their countenance of rightness without cliques cannot be measured by closeness or distance. Appearing insufficient without deference cannot be measured by nobility or baseness. Angular yet not rigid, their conduct is not rounded yet not rigidly fixed. Empty yet not ostentatious, their refinement is not substantial yet not devoid of essence. How luminous their semblance of joy—at ease and self-content! Towering in inevitability, they respond only under compulsion. How clear their hues that advance my gaze—spirit refined within, manifest without! How steadfast their power that stills my virtue—utilized outwardly, undisturbed within!

Lofty, vigilant, and unbroken—these three are the utmost in relinquishing action. Ashamed of their words, they reach the utmost in relinquishing speech.

The Dao of the true person, arriving at the relinquishing of action and speech, takes punishment, ritual, knowledge, and virtue as its foundation. The classics often compare the Dao to mountains and virtue to hills, as in the Miao-Gu-Ye Mountain, the Hidden Well and Powdered Mound, the Ju-Ci Mountain, and the Kunlun Hills.

The Dao of the true person, though applied without movement, leads others to mistakenly believe it involves action—this is to misconstrue the labor of the myriad things and doubt the uncarved simplicity of heaven and earth.

**Bi-Xu’s Commentary:**
The true person’s demeanor is free of factions, yet they remain humble as if foolish, lowly yet unyielding. Angular yet not rigid, empty yet not ostentatious, joyful in semblance, compelled only by necessity—this describes their vast and unobstructed responsiveness, measured in all interactions. Clear and harmonious, their gentle countenance instructs. Lofty and vigilant, they listen with severity and gaze upward. Unbroken in their love of silence, joyful in forgetting words—such is the Dao of the true person, unfathomable and unknowable.

Yet punishment, ritual, knowledge, and virtue are the instruments of governing the world, further embodied in structure, support, timing, and adherence. If punishment is not lenient, governance loses its foundation; if ritual does not flourish, transformation fails to spread; if knowledge is not clear, affairs stagnate. Only by following virtue in accord with ritual can one walk the Way.

A hill is elevated earth, a gathering place for people and things. "Having feet" means all who can walk may reach it. The true person, acting without action, naturally aligns with heaven’s principle. Yet when the world sees their accomplishments, they assume it was through movement.

**Zhao’s Commentary:**
They harmonize with things without forming cliques, encompassing all without partiality. If the center is insufficient, external things easily intrude—here, nothing enters, for the solid appears empty. Angularity has edges, readily clashing with things; if rigid and not angular, it is no longer angular. Empty yet not ostentatious, vast yet not boastful. Joyful in semblance, towering in inevitability—their outward demeanor radiates ease, while inwardly they act only under compulsion. Clear in advancing my gaze, tranquil yet adaptable. Harmonious in stilling my virtue, balanced yet not drifting.

Lofty in their worldly guise, they bear human form but lack human passions. Vigilant and unrestrained, vast and great—nothing can resist them. Unbroken in their love of silence, no lock can open what they close. Joyful in forgetting words, they accomplish through silence.

Punishment, ritual, knowledge, and virtue are the Dao of responding to the world only when necessary. Punishment serves as structure, its model clear yet concealed in non-use. Ritual serves as support, harmonizing knowledge with harmony, further moderated by ritual. Knowledge serves as timing, ensuring action and stillness do not miss their moment. Virtue serves as adherence, guiding those with feet to the hill.

A hill is a mountain. "Having feet" refers to people. Those who join them have no feet—they merely lend form to appearance and senses. Yet people see them as unmoving yet arriving, truly believing they have feet.

**Yuan-Qi’s Cloud:**
Righteous yet not factional, they stand alone without leaning. Humble as if insufficient, yet not self-deprecating. Angularity marks virtue’s edges; angular yet not rigid, they possess virtue’s edges without sharpness.

Expansive in ease, empty as if nothing were there. Unadorned, they are substantial. Joyful in semblance, yet not joyful. Towering in necessity, their worldly responses carry an air of inevitability. Radiant in fullness, their vitality shines forth, hence "advancing my gaze." Harmonious in self-possession, "advancing my virtue" brings auspicious stillness.

In appearance, they seem stern like others, yet inwardly they harbor the towering sense of inevitability. Vigilant and unrestrained, they do not yield to the world. Unbroken in density, they prefer silence, reluctant to speak. Before speaking, they seem unwilling; after speaking, it is as if they have not spoken—hence their joy in forgetting words, two phrases expressing one meaning.

Punishment as structure, though severe, leaves ample room, never offending my heart. Ritual as support, moving through the world while accommodating custom. Timely use of knowledge is the unavoidable response to affairs. Following heaven’s virtue naturally, without force—like people ascending hills, all who can walk arrive without needing to assume it requires labor.

This describes the true person’s state: their mind is profound and unfathomable, so we discuss only their outward semblance. Righteous yet not factional, they harmonize with things without forming cliques. Humble as if insufficient, yet not yielding—those who humble themselves are revered by others. Among the common, one must align with things and form cliques, must appear insufficient and yield. Angular yet not rigid, secure yet not cutting. Empty yet not ostentatious, substantial as if empty.

Joyful and towering in semblance—they seem pleased to aid and benefit others, yet it is as if compelled, their responses utterly without intent, thus truly responsive. Radiant in advancing my gaze, their vitality shines forth, drawing people’s delight. Harmonious in stilling my virtue, they love others with virtue, and others joyfully receive it—all this speaks to the abundance of their virtuous bearing, transforming all things.

Lofty—difficult to explain. The *Cui* edition reads "vast," signifying a virtue so boundless it encompasses the world, sufficient to embrace this age. Hence, vigilant in their greatness, they alone perfect heaven. Unbroken in their love of silence, their root remains unseen—thus the Dao of the true person admits no sound.

Punishment, ritual, knowledge, and virtue are all instruments of the former kings for governing the world. Acting in accordance with nature, harmonizing with the people, following virtue—all may ascend to the heights.

To follow is to proceed with ease, not necessarily through strenuous effort. Chen Bixu’s *Zhaowen Ruhai* and Zhang Junfang’s collated edition both render the three *hu* particles after "this age" as *ye*, aligning with the rhythm of the preceding and following sentences—this too has its rationale.

Thus, their delight in it is one, and their aversion to it is one.
That oneness is one, and that non-oneness is one.
The one joins the company of heaven; the non-one joins the company of man.
Heaven and man do not overcome one another—this is called the true person.

Life and death are a matter of fate; their constancy of night and day belongs to heaven.
That in which man has no part—all this is the nature of things.
They regard heaven as their father and cherish it as they do their own bodies—how much more should they cherish that which transcends all!
Men deem the presence of a ruler superior to themselves and would die for him—how much more should they do so for that which is true!

When the spring dries up, fish find themselves stranded on land, moistening one another with dampness, wetting one another with foam—better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao.

Guo’s commentary: Always without intent, one follows others—thus likes and dislikes, good and evil, are no different from them.
To be without any non-oneness is heaven; to insist on "that" and "this" is man.
The true person unites heaven and man, levels self and other, vast and without any non-oneness, obscure and without resistance.

To know life and death is to reach the utmost of fate—this is no delusion.
The true person, in daylight, attains daylight; in night, attains night. Taking life and death as day and night—what could they not attain?
Yet when men fail to attain something, anxiety and foreboding fill their hearts—all this is the sentiment of things, not principle.

The transcendent is called "solitary transformation."
What man relies upon is heaven; what heaven gives birth to is solitary transformation.
Man takes heaven as father, accepting day and night, cold and heat without aversion—how much more should one accept solitary transformation in the realm of profound obscurity, surely finding it impossible not to embrace it!

The true does not depend on things; it is naturally unalterable—how could it be merely the command of a true ruler?
Thus, the analogy of the stranded fish: rather than loving one another in insufficiency, is it not better to forget one another in abundance?
Praise and blame both arise from insufficiency. Those who are utterly sufficient forget good and evil, leave behind life and death, and become one with transformation—how could they know where Yao or Jie reside?

Lü’s commentary: Things see what they are one with and do not see what differs. Thus, those who delight in them find beauty and goodness, and beauty and goodness arise from this; those who do not delight in them find ugliness and ungoodness, and ugliness and ungoodness also arise from this. Therefore, delight and aversion are one.
Oneness is like water’s stillness; non-oneness is like water’s waves—yet both are water. Knowing this, one does not merely cease when ceasing.

Yet there is oneness and non-oneness: the one joins the company of heaven, withdrawing and concealing in secrecy; the non-one joins the company of man, sharing fortune and misfortune with the people.
That which arrives without being summoned is fate; that which acts without being made to act is heaven.
Life and death alternate like night and day, arising from fate and heaven—thus, that in which man has no part is the nature of things. Why should I grieve or rejoice in their midst?

Taking heaven as that from which I am born, I cherish it as I do my own body—how much more should I cherish that from which life itself is born! As father, it is transcendent—how could I not love it?
If I merely know its transcendence and love it, then life has nothing to heed.

Men deem the presence of a ruler superior to themselves and would die for him—how much more should they do so for that which is true! If I know its truth and heed it, then death has nothing to resist.

When the source of nature and fate dries up, stranded in the arid land of human artifice, they pursue the dampness of righteousness with foam—better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes of the Dao’s arts, unaware of life and death, gathering and dispersal.

Delight in life and aversion to death are sentiment; to be without death and without life is the Dao.
Praising Yao and condemning Jie are mere sentiment; to know the forgetting of both and be transformed by the Dao—then that by which one forgets life and death is not originally different.

Lin’s commentary: This speaks of punishment, ritual, knowledge, and virtue as all true—thus it further clarifies delight and aversion, merging them into one. That oneness is one, that non-oneness is one—thus oneness and non-oneness become one again.
Heaven and man are equal, without high or low—how could there be any overcoming between oneness and non-oneness?

The principle of life and death is fate; the constancy of yin and yang is heaven.
The true person follows nature: in daylight, attains daylight; in night, attains night. Taking life and death as day and night—what could they not attain? Yet if anxiety lingers in the heart, it is merely the sentiment of things, not principle.

The transcendent is the ancestor of heaven and earth; the true is the mother of the myriad things.
Things are born of heaven and take heaven as father, joyfully following without daring to oppose—how much more should they do so for the ancestor of heaven? Taking a ruler as superior to oneself, one would die for him—how much more should one do so for the mother of the myriad things!

The stranded fish moistening one another with foam—better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes. This illustrates the age of the great Dao, where things each roam freely, cocks crow and dogs bark within earshot, yet the people do not come and go. But in later ages, the Dao scatters and simplicity is lost; the single foot is divided into seven, and the whole is carved into righteousness. Father and son, elder and younger brother harbor feelings and deceive one another, then begin to seek how to govern—praising Yao and condemning Jie, their disputes endless. Better to forget one another in spontaneity.

Chen Xiangdao’s commentary: The one advances nothing in the world, standing solitary and independent, dwelling alone like a clod of earth. Heaven attains it and becomes clear; earth attains it and becomes tranquil; lords and kings attain it and become the world’s standard. Thus, the ancients who attained the Dao began by achieving oneness, progressed by embracing oneness, and ended by returning to oneness.

The true person is thus without destination yet never departs from oneness. All things are fundamentally one, yet their failure to be one arises from private intentions; when one merges with oneness, one knows that even these private intentions are but oneness. Therefore, entering into oneness, one becomes a companion of Heaven; departing from oneness, one becomes a companion of man. To be a companion of Heaven without losing man, or a companion of man without abandoning Heaven—then oneness and non-oneness are again one.

Night is the concealment of day, death the beginning of life. Seeing that night and day are not worth clinging to, how can life and death be worth lamenting? Thus, the true person has no attachment to life or death, and life and death come to them as one. As for those who cannot attain this unity, it is the nature of things. People know to take Heaven as their father and the ruler as their superior, yet do not know that what is transcendent is most worthy of love, and what is true is most worthy of preservation.

Perfect benevolence has no partiality, yet there is kindness to sustain life—those who nurture are insufficient in benevolence. Perfect wisdom has no knowledge, yet there are emotions to oppose one another—those who praise are insufficient in wisdom. Rivers and lakes are likened to the vastness of the Dao, which is why those who speak of the Dao often use water as a metaphor.

Bi Xu’s note: *De yu* means "to be with."

People’s inability to unify their likes and dislikes, harmonize Heaven and man, or equalize self and other—all these are bonds of worldly emotion. They know only to revere and love the mandate of Heaven yet fail to recognize the need to preserve its wondrous Dao; they know only to die for loyalty to their lord yet do not know to cast aside the self and cultivate the true. Fish out of water moisten one another with foam, but in rivers and lakes, they forget. People, deluded by principle, oppose and praise one another, but attaining this Dao, they are transformed.

Zhao’s note: To like is one, not to like is also one—likes and dislikes lie with others, while I have none.

Heaven has no likes or dislikes; people themselves have likes and dislikes—what victory or defeat is there? Knowing that night and day alternate by Heaven’s doing, and life and death alternate by fate’s doing, one who comprehends the Way of day and night also understands the principle of life and death. Those who do not grasp this principle delight in life and fear death—such is the nature of emotion. That by which a child is filial to their father is because the father is like Heaven, yet if one does not love the Heaven within oneself, is that acceptable? That by which a minister is loyal to their lord, even to the point of death without regard, yet does not revere the true lord within—is that acceptable? Fish on land long for water; people in chaos long for order—both cannot escape the emotion of delighting in life and fearing death. To forget in rivers and lakes, to forget in the unfolding of the Dao—then life and death are one principle, what joy or fear is there?

Juan Zhai said: Oneness is spontaneity, creation. Differences in likes and dislikes do not lie beyond creation, so oneness and non-oneness are both one. If people can share likes and dislikes, they know Heaven and thus become companions of Heaven; if they take likes and dislikes as distinct, they know only man and thus become companions of man. The true person has no likes or dislikes, no distinctions between Heaven and man, but simply follows spontaneity.

Fish in a dry streambed moistening one another with foam is a metaphor for people acting in the world; forgetting in rivers and lakes is a metaphor for embodying the Dao in non-action. The line "praising Yao and condemning Jie" is where one’s unique insight is attained—without Jie, there is no Yao; without praise, there is no blame. Forgetting both and entrusting them to spontaneity is the ultimate transformation of the Dao.

This discussion shows that the true person’s likes and dislikes arise from perfect impartiality, which is also like having no likes or dislikes. Thus, to like is one, not to like is also one; oneness is one, non-oneness is also one. Oneness, being a companion of Heaven, arises from spontaneity and is without anything that is not one; non-oneness, being a companion of man, may arise from circumstances and is not purely one. Viewed from the Dao, oneness and non-oneness are also one. Heaven does not depend on man to be complete, nor man on Heaven—what victory is there to be had?

I fear that世人 may cling to the differences in descriptions and lose sight of the great unity of principle. Therefore, I further illustrate with the analogy of life and death being like Heaven’s alternation of night and day. All who bear Heaven and tread the earth cannot avoid what they do not comprehend—this is merely the obscuration of worldly emotion. If one gathers emotion back to nature and merges Heaven and man, then one can comprehend the principle of life and death, just as night and day are constant and not worth clinging to.

People take Heaven as their father and still revere and love it—how much more should they love what is transcendent within themselves? The lord is above oneself, and one still dies for them—how much more should one preserve what is most true within? This directly points to the essence of the Dao, showing that everyone can return to seek what is transcendent and most true within themselves. Then they will know that one’s life and death are but the arising and ceasing of a single thought, the coming and going of a single breath. If one does not understand this, one loses the reason for living—how is this different from fish on land pursuing moisture with foam? How does it compare to forgetting in rivers and lakes?

*Master Nanhua* said: In making this argument, I am no different from praising Yao and condemning Jie, for I have not yet forgotten and transformed the Dao. My aim is for people to forget words and grasp it with the heart, sweeping away the paths of discourse.

**Chapter Three of the Inner Chapters: The Great and Venerable Teacher**

The Great Clod bears me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to be good to my life is to be good to my death.

Hiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh may seem secure, yet in the dead of night, a forceful one carries them away—those in the dark do not know. Though concealing the small and the great may be fitting, there is still escape. But to hide the world within the world is to find no place of delay—this is the great truth of all things.

Yet people delight in possessing human form. If human form, amidst the ten thousand transformations, has never had an end, how can its joy be measured? Therefore, the sage roams where things cannot escape and all abide.

How excellent—#1 to be good to old age, to be good to beginning and end! Even people emulate this, let alone that on which the ten thousand things depend and the one transformation awaits.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
Form, life, old age, and death are all myself. Thus, form bears me, life wearies me, old age eases me, and death rests me. Though these four change, they have never ceased to be me—why should I惜 them? Life and death are both fate. Without goodness, so be it; with goodness, there is life. Not only is life good, but my death is also good.

To speak of the inescapability of life, death, and transformation, one must first present the ultimate of inescapability, then clarify the sign of inevitable change, and finally entrust oneself to it without attachment. For the greatest #2 force is none other than transformation—lifting heaven and earth to pursue the new, bearing mountains and rivers to abandon the old. Thus, it does not pause even for a moment; in an instant, it has already entered the new, and heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things are never still. The world is ever renewed, yet people regard it as old; boats and mountains shift daily, yet they see them as before. In the blink of an arm’s exchange, all is gone into obscurity.

Thus, the "I" of the past is no longer the "I" of today. I and the present both pass away—how could I cling to the old? Not knowing to embody transformation and instead seeking to conceal it from change, even in the deepest and most secure hiding, nothing can prevent its daily transformation. To hide nothing and entrust oneself to it is to embody heaven and earth, unite with transformation, and seek escape in vain. This is the great truth of all things, not some narrow, partial intent.

Human form is but one encounter amidst the ten thousand transformations—how could only human form be delightful while other things have no joy? The sage roams the paths of transformation, drifts upon the stream of daily renewal, and with the ten thousand things and ten thousand transformations, transforms without end. Who can escape this? To equalize oneself within a hundred years, to be good to youth and not neglect old age, is enough to be a teacher to others. How much more so to be one with the ten thousand things, to embody transformation—should this not be the joy of all under heaven?

**Lü’s Commentary:**
The Great Clod has no feelings toward me. If one is good to my life, then one must be good to my death—why should I delight in one and detest the other? Things, whether great or small, exist when the mind is present and vanish when the mind is absent. If it is not the Dao, nothing remains that does not depart.

Thus, hiding a boat or a mountain in a ravine or marsh may seem secure, yet if my mind forgets them, they are suddenly lost. In the darkest hour of midnight, if something moves and hides them in the depths of mystery, is this not the work of a forceful one? Though hiding the small and great may be fitting, there is still escape. To use a life of limits to hide the boundless cosmos and expect no escape—is this the nature of ordinary things?

The world is the unity of the ten thousand things. To attain this unity and hide within it, where could the forceful one carry it away? Without true knowledge, one cannot partake in this.

**Lin’s Commentary:**
The Great Clod is the name for the Creator. In terms of form, it bears; in terms of life, it wearies; in old age, one is powerless and naturally at ease; in death, one does not seek rest yet finds it. The true person knows no ease and no rest—this is spoken only for those wearied by life.

To master the principle of being good to my life is to be good to death as well. If one cannot fulfill goodness in life, what hope is there for goodness in death? A boat is chosen for its ability to float and move; a mountain, for its stillness and immobility. Midnight symbolizes the obscure principle without trace. The forceful one refers to the Creator, bearing things away—speaking of their ceaseless transformation.

Form follows the shifts of change—how can things guard the old? In the space between a bow and a raise, ten thousand transformations have already occurred. People grasp at what they mistake for constancy. Thus, Zhuangzi uses the analogy of boats, mountains, ravines, and marshes. Only those who use things without being used by things cannot be moved by the Creator.

Yuxiong said: "Revolving without cease, heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who notices?" This aligns with the same meaning.

As for hiding the world within the world, there is nothing to hide and all is entrusted. Seeking escape is futile—this is the great truth of all things, uniting with the principle of nature and fate, becoming one with transformation.

To lodge the nature of no birth and no death within the form of ceaseless change is but one encounter amidst the ten thousand transformations—why delight solely in having form? Life does not exceed a hundred years, yet the one who gives form has no end or beginning. What limit is there to the encounters? How can their joy be measured?

The path the sage roams is that of hiding the world within the world, thus nothing is not preserved. To be good to premature death and old age, to be good to beginning and end—though one has not forgotten life and death, one can fully realize nature. Thus, one may serve as a model for others. How much more so for one who, attaining the mandate, can master things, on whom the ten thousand things depend and the one transformation awaits!

**Xiang Dao’s Commentary:**
From birth to death, the great transformation has four aspects: bearing me, wearying me—these should be detestable, yet people delight in them...

The one who frees me, the one who rests me—these should be joyous, yet people detest them. There is no other reason: they lack the Dao to make them good. The Dao’s goodness to my life is precisely its goodness to my death. In life, one floats; in death, one rests. What is mine remains with me, entrusted to where it abides, not forced to follow what lies beyond. How could one hoard what is stored to secure what one possesses, or delight in form to pride oneself on what one encounters?

To hide a boat in a ravine is to hide something small; to hide a mountain in a marsh is to hide something great. At midnight, it cannot be seen. With force, it cannot be resisted. Though the boat and the mountain differ in size and movement, they are alike in being carried away by the powerful—so too with humans and transformation: should one hide it in stillness? Or hide it in motion? Transformation cannot be escaped by stillness or motion. How much better to hide the world within the world, vast and unobstructed, becoming one with transformation?

The great truth of all things is to become one with transformation; they are merely burdened by things and sunk in the petty. The sage roams where things cannot pursue, thus is not bound by things yet is what things depend on, does not await transformation yet is what transformation awaits.

**Bixu’s Commentary:**
The great clod is primordial qi. The "I" is the name for the numinous thing, yet the numinous thing is fundamentally nonexistent. Birth, aging, death—where do they arise? From having form. Thus, I am not originally borne—it is because of form; I am not originally wearied—it is because of life; I am not originally freed—it is because of aging; I am not originally rested—it is because of death. Observing how the Dao’s goodness can give life to things, one knows it must also be good at giving death to things. Now, to take joy in Heaven as goodness to my life and to know fate as goodness to my death—what fault is there in this?

The "powerful one at midnight" is the unfathomable spirit of yin and yang. To carry and flee is the ceaseless work of creation. Moreover, can one who hides things lack guards lest they escape? How can they be prevented? Yet things do not lie in hiding; there is a principle that does not shift. Who can know this? If the flying does not know the sinking, then the sinking is hidden; if this does not know that, then that is hidden. This is called self-hiding, not hiding by things. This is the great truth of all things, not something borrowed from the enlightened.

To take the cosmos as a single chamber is to lose the world’s existence—what is this if not hiding? "Unifying the world" is the general name for all things, moving and still. The so-called hiding is subtle shifting without awareness. Dreaming of being a bird and soaring in the sky, dreaming of being a fish and diving into the abyss—endless transformations, endless joys. Why delight solely in encountering human form?

What things cannot pursue is creation. The sage travels the path of no-mind and no-transformation, thus all things are preserved. People imitate and merely admire the road, yet when it comes to the essential, they have nothing to say—this is what the ten thousand transformations revere. To have goodness and dependence is not true liberation.

**Zhao’s Commentary:**
Life is the traveler; death is the one who returns. Life must have death; travel must have return. This is how creation is good to my life and good to my death—simply resting in naturalness. Boat and ravine, mountain and marsh—these are fitting for hiding small and large, yet yin has a way to shift them unawares. This speaks of how form inevitably changes. But to hide the world within the world—then above and below, the four directions, past and present, all are inseparable. How could they return?

Form and color are one’s nature; one’s nature is form and color. The great truth of all things means that this principle applies to humans and things alike. To possess a hundred limbs and be human is already cause for delight—how much more so for the one who gives form? The sage knows that being confined to the world of form does not escape fate, yet joins with it boundlessly, thus all things are preserved. To handle premature death, old age, beginning, and end with goodness—people still emulate this. How much more so for the one who moves beyond form yet can give form to form? This is what the ten thousand things depend on, what the one transformation awaits—the highest goodness. How can it not be revered?

Things are myriad, yet transformation is one. This one is here. **Yongzhai** says: The metaphors of hiding the boat, hiding the mountain, and the midnight flight speak of how human plans, though deeply secret, cannot be free. To hide the world within the world is to entrust it to naturalness, with nothing to pursue. The true state of the ten thousand things is always thus. People all delight in having form yet do not know that the human body undergoes a thousand changes, and the ten thousand things are complete within me. How can their joy be measured?

The sage’s mind roams in spontaneity, without gain or loss, drinking the sun and wandering where things cannot pursue—yet all things are preserved. To be good to premature death and old age, to be good to beginning and end—creation can do this, and people still emulate it. How much more so the Dao? What the ten thousand things depend on, what the one transformation awaits, is simply the Dao. Its words rise higher with each passage—such is Zhuangzi’s brushwork.

The "great clod" originally refers to earth, but here it signifies creation. "Bearing me with form" is like saying "clothing bears me"—with a hundred limbs complete, spirit rides them, for it cannot but bear. "Wearying me with life" means that daily activities, food and drink, pain and cold—all serve to toil me, and I cannot but be wearied. "Freeing me with aging" means that when blood and qi decline, the body daily weakens, the mind daily fades, and I cannot but be freed. "Resting me with death" means that when qi is exhausted and spirit departs, the four great elements separate, and one lies still in the great chamber—this cannot but be rest.

From this, one knows that people’s worry about death while alive is all delusion. If in life one thinks of how to be good to one’s life—avoiding harm to life, defiance of principle, injury to others, and damage to things—how could one’s death not be good?

That which gives me life is Creation, but that which makes my life good is myself. What difference is there between life and death? Hiding a boat in the mountains—this is a metaphor for man dwelling within the transformations of Creation yet seeking to escape its changes, which cannot be done. If among the things of the world there is hiding, there must be escape; if there is escape, then it ceases to exist. Only that which has no place of hiding allows things no escape and thus all remain. The place where things cannot escape and all remain is the realm of "nothing-whatsoever," the vast and boundless wilds. Roaming therein, following the unobstructed flow of the mindless, gazing with open clarity—nothing is not preserved. This is the Way of "hiding the world within the world."

Though one emerges from the mechanism and enters the mechanism, though the ten thousand transformations of life and change unfold, one sees only daily renewal—where can things escape? Yet worldly people, clinging to private views, often take things as their own possessions, believing boats and mountains to be inescapable things, gullies and marshes to be hidable places, and forms and substances to have unchanging methods. They do not realize that the hidden pivot silently turns, not pausing even for an instant, and that things, earth, and form all transform together without awareness.

Then is there a Way to transcend and escape transformation? It is said: hold to no hiding and no clinging; let the mind roam with Heaven. Even seeking the present moment cannot be attained—how then could one know what is called escape and transformation? To die young well or to grow old well—all original texts agree; only the Chen Bixu edition collated by Zhang Junfang reads "to be young well or to grow old well," which is superior in meaning.

The Dao has sentiment and sincerity, yet is without action and without form. It can be transmitted but not received, can be attained but not seen.

The Dao is self-so from its own root, existing before Heaven and Earth, enduring from antiquity; it spiritually animates ghosts and emperors, gives birth to Heaven and Earth. It stands before the Great Ultimate yet is not high, lies beneath the Six Poles yet is not deep, precedes the birth of Heaven and Earth yet is not ancient, endures beyond high antiquity yet is not old.

When Xīwéi attained it, he used it to lift Heaven and Earth; when Fúxī attained it, he used it to inherit the Mother of Qi; when the Northern Dipper attained it, it remained ever unaggressive; when the sun and moon attained it, they never ceased; when Kānhuài attained it, he inherited Mount Kūnlún; when Féngyí attained it, he roamed the great rivers; when Jiānwú attained it, he dwelled in the great mountains; when the Yellow Emperor attained it, he ascended to the cloudy heavens; when Zhuānxū attained it, he resided in the Dark Palace; when Yúqiáng attained it, he stood at the North Pole; when the Queen Mother of the West attained it, she sat in the Lesser Expanse—none knew her beginning, none knew her end. When Péngzǔ attained it, he lived from the age of Yǔ to the Five Hegemons; when Fù Yuè attained it, he assisted Wǔ Dīng, oversaw the world, rode the Eastern Rope and the Tail of the Winnowing Basket, and ranked among the arrayed stars.

Guō’s commentary: The emotion of no-emotion is non-action; the emotion of constant nothingness is formlessness. Though transmitted from antiquity and dwelling within, none can receive and possess it; all attain self-containment, yet none see its form. Existing before Heaven and Earth from antiquity confirms that nothingness cannot be made to have or to lack—how then could it generate spirit? It does not spiritually animate ghosts and emperors, yet ghosts and emperors animate themselves; it does not give birth to Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth arise of themselves. Thus we know that spirit is ultimately insufficient to be called spirit, and that which does not spirit is true spirit. The Dao is high yet not high, deep yet not deep, enduring yet not enduring, old yet not old—nowhere is it not present, yet wherever it is present, it is not.

Above and below, it goes everywhere, yet cannot be called high or low; within and without, it reaches everywhere, yet cannot be named inner or outer. It shifts with transformation, so cannot be called enduring; it has no beginning or end, so cannot be called old. From Xīwéi attaining it to lift Heaven and Earth to Fù Yuè riding the Tail of the Winnowing Basket and ranking among the stars, the Dao cannot be grasped—this speaks of attaining it as self-attainment. The difficulty of life lies in solitary transformation and self-attainment; once life is attained, why would one fail to attain cessation of life and act upon it? To act is to harm one’s life.

Lǚ’s commentary: The ears and eyes attain it to see and hear; the hands and feet attain it to move—how could it lack emotion? Cold and heat attain it to alternate; the myriad things attain it to be born and nurtured—how could it lack sincerity? Yet seeking its agent, none can be found—this is formlessness. Some understand without words; some perceive it in an instant—this is transmissibility. Yet none can possess it—it cannot be received. With the mind, one intuits it, and it harmonizes effortlessly—this is attainability. Yet no trace of it can be seen—it is invisible. The birth of the myriad things has never lacked a root, yet the Dao is self-so from its own root. The myriad things arise only after Heaven and Earth, yet the Dao existed before Heaven and Earth, enduring from antiquity. Ghosts and emperors attain me to be spirit, yet I am not spirit—even ghosts and emperors lack numinous resonance. Heaven and Earth attain me to be born, yet I am not born—even today, they remain the Great Ultimate. High and deep describe its form; enduring and old describe its time. Yet I am without form and without time—thus the Dao is hidden and nameless.

Though the sages of antiquity differed in concealment and manifestation, none failed to attain the Dao and become sagely—this is not limited to Xīwéi through Fù Yuè alone. The Dao is the mother of the world; from Heaven downward, none fail to attain the Dao and stand—this is not limited to the Northern Dipper and the sun and moon. This is not something human sentiment can fathom, yet it is nothing more than what those who attain the Dao can do—is this not why it is called the Great Master?

Lín’s commentary: Emotion refers to the nature and destiny of life. Sincerity means that within it lies constancy, acting without contrivance and perpetually natural, beyond the control of yin and yang. The Dao has emotion toward the myriad things, thus they live without resistance. Yet it accomplishes without ever acting, responds without ever taking form. That which can be transmitted or received has not departed from things; that which can be attained or seen has not departed from form. Transmission without that which is transmitted cannot be received; attainment without that which is attained cannot be seen. The son of Shū Biān could not receive it from his father; Xiàngwǎng sought the pearl but could attain it without seeing it. In stillness, the sun returns to destiny—this is self-so from its root. Each returns to its root—this is self-so from its own root. Enduring from antiquity, it is able to preserve preservation without change.

Spirit in humans is called ghost; spirit in Heaven is called emperor. The death of a sage is called spirit, for his death is no different from his life; the death of an ordinary person is called ghost, for his life is no different from his death. Thus, exhausting human spirit, I precede Heaven and Earth. As *Lǎozǐ* says: "The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth." Thus, in height it is not high, in depth it is not deep, in birth it is not born, in age it is not old.

From Xīwéi to Fù Yuè, this broadly discusses those who attained the Dao, its meaning akin to *Lǎozǐ*’s "Of old, those who attained the One." The Great Ease is before qi is seen; the Great Beginning is the inception of qi. Before qi is seen is the father, thus qi is the mother. The Dipper is the guiding rope of Heaven. Kānhuài is the name of a spirit. Féngyí is the water spirit. Jiānwú is the name of a regulator. Yúqiáng is the spirit of the Northern Sea. From the Queen Mother of the West to Fù Yuè, all were ancient attainers of the Dao—though their deeds cannot be fully investigated, one should seek them with the mind and not cling to their traces.

Detailed Annotations on the Dao:
That which responds and thereby penetrates is the realm of the affective; because it is affective, it is trustworthy. That which is utterly still and unmoving is non-action; because it is non-action, it is formless. As the *Qiwù Lùn* states: "It may be practiced and trusted, yet its form is not seen," and again: "It is affective yet formless—how could the Dao be easily known?" Precisely because of this, it may be transmitted through the mind but cannot be received [as an object], may be attained through one’s nature but cannot be seen. For what is transmitted is no transmission, and what is attained is no attainment.

In its origin, it is self-so and self-rooted; before Heaven and Earth existed, it was already eternally present. In its function, it spirits forth ghosts and spirits forth the Divine Lord, gives birth to Heaven and gives birth to Earth. Above and below, it has no fixed abode—it cannot be spoken of in terms of height or depth; its transformations have no fixed form—it cannot be spoken of in terms of age or duration. Spiriting forth ghosts and spirits forth the Divine Lord, the Dao is the father of spirits; giving birth to Heaven and giving birth to Earth, the Dao is the mother of spirits.

From Xīwéi to Fù Yuè, these speak of the ancients who attained the Dao—some ascended to Heaven, some coiled within mountains, some submerged in the abyss—yet all preserved their undying longevity and unfathomable spirit. This is the subtlety of the Great Master.

Bìxū’s Annotation:
Ever skillful in saving beings—this is the affective. Responding and thereby penetrating—this is the trustworthy. Affective yet non-active, trustworthy yet formless: this is why it may be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. Ghosts govern the yin, the Divine Lord rules the yang; the unfathomability of yin and yang arises from their possession of spirit. The ceaseless generation of Heaven and Earth arises from their possession of the Dao. The Dao’s height, depth, duration, and age cannot be grasped by thought or discourse, for it is omnipresent.

Lord Lǎo spoke of attaining the One in relation to Heaven and Earth, the Valley Spirit, the myriad things, and the feudal lords. Zhuāngzǐ of Qīyuán spoke of those from Xīwéi to Fù Yuè who attained it—yet here, the One is forgotten. Thus the Dao’s transformations are inexhaustible to the thousand sages.

Zhào’s Annotation:
Affective and trustworthy—these may be named and spoken of. Non-active and formless—these cannot be named or spoken of. Transmissible yet not receivable: affective and trustworthy in reality, yet nothing to receive. Attainable yet not visible: non-active and formless in reality, yet nothing to see. That by which ghosts are numinous and the Divine Lord governs is the spirit that arises from this.

The following elaborates on the Dao’s functions—its meaning is already clear and requires no further explication.

Yōngzhāi’s Remarks:
The preceding section did not mention the word "Dao," but here it is finally introduced to speak of the Great Master. Affect and trust are both real. Non-action offers no point of entry; formlessness has no fixed shape. Transmissible yet not receivable, attainable yet not visible—only those who embody the Dao know this. The *Guānyǐnzǐ*, Chapter One, clearly addresses the matter of transmission.

Self-so and self-rooted—this traces its origin. Before Heaven and Earth existed, this Dao was already present: this is called the Limitless that gives rise to the Supreme Polarity. Ghosts are the advance of creation; the Divine Lord is the ruler of Heaven. That by which ghosts and the Divine Lord are spirit is this Dao; Heaven and Earth also arise only after the Dao. This is called: "The Supreme Polarity gives birth to the Two Modes." Thus its height, depth, duration, and age cannot be known.

From Xīwéi to Fù Yuè, all spoke of those who attained the Dao and thereby achieved such things. From the beginning of the chapter, which narrates the Way of the Perfected and the principle of life and death, to this point, it further discusses the Dao’s essence and the ancients who attained it, offering proof. Though the language is extraordinary, the principle is perfectly clear—all commentaries have discussed it in detail.

The question of "spiriting forth ghosts and spirits forth the Divine Lord" is particularly striking. I humbly append my humble insights at the end of this passage: ghosts and the Divine Lord are yin and yang, self-so and self-rooted, formless yet spirit. In motion, they give birth to Heaven and Earth—these may be named and spoken of, are formed yet spirit. In their essence, they are nowhere and yet everywhere, non-active and yet all-active.

How then could one even discuss the loftiness, profundity, longevity, or venerability of such matters? This principle fundamentally derives from the *Daodejing*: "The gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth." The Mysterious Female is but another name for yin and yang. To comprehend the gate of the Mysterious Female is to grasp the meaning of ghosts and the Divine Lord. The spirit resides within yin and yang, alternating as substance and function—this is called the wondrous subtlety of the boundless and unfathomable.

Truly, if one knows that which gives birth to Heaven and Earth, then the origin of one’s own body becomes known without deliberate inquiry. Once the source is known, how could its departure remain obscure?

Nanbo Zikui asked Nü’ou, “You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child—how is this so?” Nü’ou replied, “I have heard the Dao.”

Nanbo Zikui said, “Can the Dao be learned?” Nü’ou answered, “Alas, how could it be! You are not the right person. Now, Pulang Yi possesses the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping that he might indeed become a sage. If not, to impart the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy indeed. Yet I still guarded it and instructed him.

After three days, he was able to put the world outside himself. Having put the world outside, I again guarded it for him, and after seven days, he was able to put things outside himself. Having put things outside, I again guarded it for him, and after nine days, he was able to put life outside himself. Having put life outside, he could then attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, he could then perceive the solitary. Perceiving the solitary, he could then transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, he could then enter into that which is neither dead nor alive.

That which slays life does not die; that which gives life to life does not live. As a thing, it sends nothing forth without escort, receives nothing without welcome; destroys nothing without completion, and accomplishes nothing without fulfillment.”

Its name is "Cherry Tranquility." "Cherry Tranquility" means that only after being buffeted does one attain completion.

Nanbo Zigui said: "How did you alone come to hear of this?"
He replied: "I heard it from the son of Deputy Ink, the son of Deputy Ink heard it from the grandson of Recitation, the grandson of Recitation heard it from Gazing Clarity, Gazing Clarity heard it from Whispered Assent, Whispered Assent heard it from Waiting Service, Waiting Service heard it from At the Pivot, At the Pivot heard it from Dark Obscurity, Dark Obscurity heard it from Joined Solitude, and Joined Solitude heard it from Doubting the Beginning."

Guo's commentary: "External" means to relinquish. Things are what one requires morning and evening, intimately bound and hard to forget. To externalize life is to relinquish it entirely. Having relinquished life, whatever one encounters is at peace, suddenly unobstructed, perceiving the incipient and acting—this is morning clarity. Forgetting before and after is perceiving the solitary; without past or present, the solitary is all there is. Clinging to life gives rise to death; abhorring death gives rise to life. Without clinging or abhorrence, there is neither death nor life. Allowing things to escort and welcome, there is nothing that does not escort and welcome. Allowing things to destroy and complete, there is nothing that is not destroyed and completed. One who merges with things—where things entangle, so too does one entangle—yet has never not been tranquil. Entangled yet allowing it, nothing is not bent to completion.

From hearing it from Deputy Ink to Dark Obscurity, Dark Obscurity is that by which one names the nameless yet is not nothing, and then further entrusts it to Joined Solitude—mystery upon mystery. The principles of nature are formed through accumulated practice, thus after seven layers one reaches the name of nothingness, and after nine layers one doubts that nothingness is the beginning.

Lü's commentary: When people hear the Dao, their anxieties and breaths cannot enter, hence with age their complexions wither. Those who possess the Dao of the sage grasp its great root and great origin; those who possess the talent of the sage can extend this Dao to the world and the state. Boliang Yi had the talent but not the Dao, thus I guarded and instructed him, proceeding from the coarse to the refined. Having externalized the world, one then externalizes things; having externalized things, one then externalizes life; having externalized life, one then attains morning clarity—this speaks of profound obscurity within the body’s self-examination, reaching clarity that is like dawn. Perceiving the solitary means that "that" and "this" find no counterpart. Without past or present, the myriad ages are unified into one pure completion. Neither dead nor alive—those who die are slain by me, yet I have never died; those who live are given life by me, yet I have never lived. Though escorting, welcoming, completing, and destroying are all buffeting, I have never been endangered, hence the name "Cherry Tranquility." "Cherry Tranquility" means that only after being buffeted does one attain completion.

The Dao, when embodied, is the norm; what is discussed in texts and ink is merely its deputy. "Recitation" means to string together and recite; "sons and grandsons" speak of where the Dao is born. "Gazing Clarity" is the clarity of perceiving principle. "Whispered Assent" is to tread and practice it. "Waiting Service" is to await things and employ them. "At the Pivot" is to chant and delight in it. From Deputy Ink to Gazing Clarity, one studies and gains insight; from Whispered Assent to At the Pivot, one practices and reaches joy, yet these are still insufficient to be the body of the Dao. "Dark Obscurity" is without seeing or knowing. "Joined Solitude" is where even nothingness does not stand. Doubting it as the beginning yet not knowing it as the beginning—this is its very beginning.

Lin's commentary: The Dao is the counterpart of destiny; talent is the capacity of nature. Those with the talent of the sage have fully realized their nature; those with the Dao of the sage have reached destiny. To say the sage’s talent is without the Dao is not so—when emerging to save the world, what governs is talent. To say the sage’s Dao is without talent is not so—when withdrawing into non-action, what governs is the Dao. Instructing one with the talent of the sage in the Dao of the sage, guiding them into non-action, seems easy. Yet I still guarded and instructed him: after three days, he could externalize the world; after seven days, he could externalize things; after nine days, he could externalize life. Forgetting the world and things is still easy; life is what people find hardest to forget. Externalizing life means not living yet being able to give life—this is the ultimate attainment of the Dao. When the qi of night is preserved, dawn is also clear; only then can one perceive the solitary. The solitary is apart from yin and yang, without counterpart, seen beyond what the eyes can reach. Without past or present, it is not pushed by the changes of the world. Neither dead nor alive, one reaches destiny. Commanding things yet not commanded by things—this is being able to slay life. Making things into things yet not made into a thing by things—this is being able to give life. As a thing, it is also a forced name, thus one allows things to escort, welcome, complete, and destroy. When things are buffeted by things, they are disturbed and not tranquil; only the Dao is buffeted and then completed.

"Deputy Ink" is the deputy of brush and ink. "Luo" is the place where texts emerge. "Recitation" is the act of memorizing and practicing. "Gazing Clarity" is having insight and understanding principle. "Whispered Assent" is assenting by leaning close to the ear. "Waiting Service" is acting with dependence. "At the Pivot" is seen in chanting and song. "Dark" is the essence of the subtle; "obscurity" is the concealment of clarity. "Joined" is one that severs being, two that severs nothingness; "solitude" is the name of emptiness and stillness. Only then does one doubt that nothingness is the beginning. These nine names are established to illustrate that hearing the Dao must proceed gradually.

Detailed commentary on the Dao: Things are the burdens of the body, thus externalizing things allows one to externalize life; life is the burden of the Dao, thus externalizing life allows one to attain morning clarity—since the qi of night is not forgotten, dawn is clear. The Dao has no counterpart, thus what is seen is solitary. Unifying past and present into one time, connecting death and life into one thread, there is no escorting or welcoming, no completing or destroying. The pure qi is not diminished within, and the myriad things do not buffet it without, so one’s complexion is like that of a child—nothing strange in this. Those who cling to life slay life, yet those who slay life do not die; those who cling to slaying give life, yet those who give life do not live.

As for things in their nature:
what departs is without fail escorted,
what arrives is without fail welcomed,
what is completed is without fail destroyed,
what is destroyed is without fail completed—
this is what is meant by "entanglement yielding completion."

Master Bixu notes:
One possessing the innate endowment of a sage must rely on the sage’s wondrous function;
one harboring the sage’s wondrous function must rely on the sage’s innate endowment.
Yet if one clings to uncarved simplicity without transformation,
this cannot be called perfection.
Only by preserving and transmitting it can it be deemed transmissible.

To set the world aside is to realize that the bluntness of earth may be relinquished;
to set things aside is to see that the dregs of entanglement need not be heeded;
to set life aside is to awaken to the emptiness of memory and ferment;
to attain morning clarity is to perceive dawn alone.
To see alone is to regard the Dao as without peer.
Without past, without present, one connects all generations;
without life, without death, one returns to the source.
Those who slay life do not die,
those who give life do not live—
this means that those who execute the thieves of life preserve their bodies,
while those who advance the delusions of life hasten death.

Things merely entangle,
preferring completion yet unable to overturn.
*Fu mo* are teaching texts;
*luo song* is recitation;
to perceive principles is called "gazing clarity";
to hear instruction is called "attentive assent."
When awaiting service, one waits for application;
when at the pivot, one chants.
*Xuan ming* refers to profound obscurity;
*can liao* refers to reaching the utmost;
*yi shi* means no knowing of a beginning before the beginning.

Zhao’s commentary:
Setting aside the world, things, and life—
these three are one in relinquishment,
differing only in moving from coarse to refined.
Once one can set life aside,
nothing remains unilluminated—
this is what is called "morning clarity."
With morning clarity, what is seen stands alone;
what is seen standing alone means past and present endure;
with past and present enduring, how can there be life and death?
As *Liezi* states:
"That which gives life does not live,
that which transforms does not transform"—
this clarifies the principle.

Escorting and welcoming, destroying and completing—
all follow the spontaneity of things,
yet nothing is not escorted or welcomed,
nothing is not destroyed or completed,
for one never ceases to engage with things.
"Entanglement yielding" means that when one is ensnared by such words,
a sudden awakening dissolves all principles—
this is "entanglement yielding completion."

Zikui further asked how one might hear such words.
*Fu mo* are writings;
*luo song* are words;
*zhan ming* is seeing;
*nie xu* is hearing;
*xu yi* is acting;
*yu shu* is singing;
*xuan ming* is silent comprehension;
*can liao* is seeking in the distant;
*yi shi* is doubting a beginning.
All are figurative expressions.

Yongzhai said:
Only those who unite Dao and talent in full—
beyond the Five Emperors and Three Kings—
are Yi Yin, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius.
The three days, seven days, nine days need not be rigidly interpreted;
they simply denote one stage surpassing the next.
"Morning clarity" means the chest is radiant,
like the limpid qi of early dawn.
"Seeing alone" means seeing for oneself what others do not see.
Without past or present, there is no life or death.
"Slaying life yet not dying,
giving life yet not living"
means that though one slays, it is not death,
and though one gives life, it is not life.
Without escorting or welcoming, without completing or destroying,
all is spontaneous—
amidst entanglement and turmoil, what is settled remains constant,
this is "entanglement yielding completion."

After words come written bamboo slips—
ink’s duplicate.
Wrapping and reciting them,
reading by the text, reciting from memory,
is like a son begetting a grandson.
Later passages echo earlier explanations:
the Dao is gained through reading,
giving rise to many names,
until ultimately returning to creation.
*Xuan ming* is the beginning of qi;
*can liao* is the beginning of the nameless;
*yi shi* is the beginning before the beginning.
Though the Dao is attained through texts,
it is originally inherent in our nature.

The Dao establishes the center and founds the pole,
enlightening the human heart;
talent opens things and accomplishes tasks,
expanding patterns and creating enterprises.
The sage takes the world as his heart,
bearing the weight of transformation—
in these two, neither can be neglected.
Weighing their relative importance,
one should abide in the Dao with surplus,
never inclining toward talent’s dominance.
Thus in the transformation of Nü Yu,
Boliang still preserved and transmitted it,
fearing talent’s obstruction of the Dao and the difficulty of entry.

First setting the world aside discards the coarse;
setting things aside discards what is external;
setting life aside discards what is within.
If even what is within is relinquished,
nothing remains unforgotten.
"Morning clarity" illuminates what things do not;
"seeing alone" perceives what things cannot.
Without past or present, time cannot be constrained;
without life or death, form cannot be fixed.
To regard death as cruelty is to be unable to slay life;
to regard life as grace is to be unable to give life.
Only by having no escorting or welcoming,
no completing or destroying,
can one have nothing not escorted or welcomed,
nothing not completed or destroyed—
this is called "entanglement yielding tranquility."

Master Guo glosses *ying* as "entanglement";
here it is taken as written.
Living in the world, one engages with things,
rarely without entanglement disturbing the heart.
The multitude are entangled and disordered;
the sage is entangled yet tranquil.
Entanglement yielding disorder is the Dao’s loss;
entanglement yielding tranquility is the Dao’s completion—
akin to the principle of constant response and constant stillness,
though the phrasing is rather extraordinary.

Later passages from *fu mo* to *yi shi* are thoroughly explained;
here they are not repeated.

Zisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai spoke among themselves:
"Who can take non-action as the head,
life as the spine,
death as the tailbone,
and know that death, life, existence, and perishing are one body?
We would befriend such a one."
The four looked at one another and smiled,
their hearts in perfect accord,
and so became friends.

Soon after, Ziyu fell ill.
Zisi went to inquire of him, saying:
"How magnificent!"

The Maker would shape me into this contorted form!
My spine is crooked, my back hunched,
five tubes jutting from my nape,
my chin buried in my navel,
shoulders towering above my crown,
and a fleshy lump pointing skyward.
The qi of my yin and yang is in disarray—
yet my heart remains at ease, untroubled.
Though my calloused soles mirror the well’s depths, I say:
Alas! Would the Maker truly fashion me into this twisted state?

Zisi asked: "Do you resent this?"
He replied: "No, why should I resent it?
Were my left arm transformed into a rooster,
I would use it to herald the dawn;
were my right arm turned into a crossbow,
I would use it to hunt roasted quail.
Were my corpse made into a wheel
and my spirit into a horse,
I would mount them and ride—why seek another steed?
Moreover, gain is but timing,
loss is but compliance.
Abiding in timing, dwelling in compliance,
neither joy nor sorrow can enter.
This is what the ancients called ‘suspended release.’
Those who cannot release themselves are bound by things.
Yet things have long been no match for Heaven—
what have I to resent?"

The Maker would shape me into this twisted state—
as if weary of my life,
prompting Zisi’s question.
Three transformations unfold in gradual succession,
yet what I embody remains one:
this is what is meant by the myriad changes never reaching an end.
Why should I resent it?
Taking non-being as the head,
life as the spine,
death as the tailbone—
the spirit is that which turns them.
Thus, I make my corpse into a wheel,
my spirit into a horse,
and ride them without hesitation.
How could I seek another steed?

Life’s arrival cannot be known—
gain is but timing.
Its departure cannot be resisted—
loss is but compliance.
Abiding in timing, dwelling in compliance,
sorrow and joy cannot enter,
and nothing remains suspended.
This is the meaning of release.
To seek against timing,
to resist what is compliant—
this is to be bound by things and unable to release oneself.
What comes cannot be refused,
what goes cannot be stopped—
thus we know things are no match for Heaven.
Why should I resent it?

Yongzhai observes: "Head, spine, corpse—these are but the beginning and end. Man emerges from non-being into being, and once there is being, there follows life and death. From *How grand!* onward, all describes the symptoms of this affliction, showing how I am bound by such petty constraints—this is the work of the Creator.

The passage on *gradual transformation* is most extraordinary: if the Creator were to slowly change my body into other things, I would simply make use of them—this is the meaning of following the transformations of creation without preference or aversion. Though spoken in parable, it carries its own truth.

*Release* means the heart is free from attachment. Those who cannot free themselves are bound by things—how can the myriad things ever overcome the principle of nature?

Consider these four: taking non-being as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tailbone—those who understand that life, death, existence, and extinction are one body are fit to be friends. This aligns with the *Gengsang Chu* chapter, which begins with non-being and being, then life arising and swiftly turning to death, taking non-being as the head, life as the body, and death as the tailbone. Whoever grasps that non-being, being, life, and death are a single continuum—such a one I would befriend. The various commentaries have discussed this in detail.

In the passage below, Guo [Xiang] parses *there is sand* as a phrase, while my interpretation follows his. The *Pronunciation and Meaning* records Cui’s edition, which parses *from his heart* as a phrase, linking *idle and untroubled* to the following text—this also makes sense.

Man, confined within the forms of Heaven and Earth, is already bound by the Creator. Now, afflicted with such cramped deformities, he is further bound by his own form. Though the qi of yin and yang may scatter externally, if the heart remains idle and untroubled, gazing at one’s reflection in a well, one may sigh at being bound by form—yet if one cannot ultimately forget attachment and find peace in what Heaven has bestowed, what aversion could there be?

If my arm were transformed into a rooster or a crossbow pellet, I would seek the reality of rooster or pellet. If my corpse and spirit were transformed into a wheel or a horse, I would seek their use. Having entered the mechanism of transformation, one should follow whatever comes and yield to it—how could one resist?

Gain is timing; loss is compliance—this is what is meant by *when it comes, Master, it is timing; when it goes, Master, it is compliance.* This is what is called *release.* Bound, one is tied to the Creator; released, the Creator cannot hold one. Those who are bound yet cannot free themselves are knotted by things. Only by following the principle of nature, neither clinging nor resisting, can one untie these bonds. Thus it is said: *things cannot overcome Heaven.*

Soon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping as if near death. His wife and children gathered around weeping. Zili went to see him and shouted: "Away! Begone! Do not disturb his transformation!" Leaning against the doorframe, he said to them: "How grand is the Creator! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you into a mouse’s liver? A bug’s arm?"

Zilai replied: "A child follows their parents’ commands, whether east or west, north or south. Yin and yang are to man no less than parents. If they bring me near death and I do not obey, I would be defiant—what fault would lie with them? The great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well.

Now, if a great smelter were casting metal, and the metal leapt up saying, *I must become a Moye sword!* the smelter would surely deem it an inauspicious metal. Now, if one were to acquire a human form and say, *I am a man! A man!* the Creator would surely deem it an inauspicious person. If one takes Heaven and Earth as a great furnace and the Creator as a great smelter, where could one go and not be acceptable? Falling asleep in completion, awakening in continuity."

Guo’s commentary: "Death and life are like waking and sleeping. By principle, one should sleep without wishing to be startled. When transformation brings death, do not be alarmed by it."

Since ancient times, some have defied their parents’ commands, but none have defied the changes of yin and yang. When it is time to die, it cannot be forbidden. To harbor a rebellious heart is to hasten one’s death through defiance—this is not the fault of death. Thus, to treat one’s life well is to treat one’s death well; the principle is constant in both.

*I am a man! A man!*—one wishes only to be human. When metal leaps in the smelter, the world knows it is inauspicious. Life is not made by design; it arises of itself. To cling to it is delusion. Just as people know that metal’s attachment is inauspicious, if one recognizes that one is no different from metal, then the attachments of the heart can be released. Waking and sleeping remain the same, and one is not burdened by life and death.

Lü’s commentary: "Mice and bugs are what people most despise, and their scattered qi and forms becoming livers or arms are what people most loathe. At such a time, to ask about what is despised and loathed is to test Zilai’s equanimity. Knowing that yin and yang are to man no less than parents and obeying them, knowing that the great clod rests me with death and treating it well—why ask what it will make of you or where it will send you?

When metal leaps in the smelter, people deem it inauspicious. So too with man’s wish to remain human. If one takes Heaven, Earth, and the Creator as a furnace and smelter, then mouse livers and bug arms are no different—where could one not go? Why should I be concerned? *Falling asleep in completion, awakening in continuity*—this speaks of the ease between death and life, like waking and sleeping, without alteration."

Lin’s commentary: "Mouse livers and bug arms are the smallest of things, akin to the snake’s scales and cicada’s wings in the *Qi Wu Lun*, showing that the transformations of creation are endless and beyond human knowledge. A child obeys their parents’ commands without daring to defy them. Man receives from yin and yang no less than from parents—why not obey the changes of life and death? Whether becoming a mouse’s liver or a bug’s arm, one follows what comes and finds peace. The Creator brings me near death—how dare I resist?"

Should one resist, the fault lies with the child—what fault is theirs? *Xiang Dao’s commentary*: "The mouse liver is anger stored within; the bug’s arm, anger manifest without. Living between heaven and earth, to resist the commands of yin and yang and refuse to heed them—how is this different from a mouse’s liver or a bug’s arm? Yin and yang’s relation to man is no less than that of parents, and one cannot but obey. To compare the body to smelted metal: one cannot leap and twist to become a *Mo Ye* blade. This illustrates the absence of joy or anger in matters of life and death."

*Bi Xu’s commentary*: "The Dao exists even in excrement and urine—how much more in a mouse’s liver or a bug’s arm! Those who defy the commands of their elders are called unfilial; then how can those who resist the principles of transformation be said to follow the Dao? When the Creator brings one near death, to refuse and resist is to betray one’s innate nature—what fault lies with transformation? It is like a great smelter casting metal: the mold cannot be defied, so how can transformation be resisted? *Falling asleep in the merging of the hun-souls, awakening in the opening of form*—though the states of merging and opening differ, the nature of stillness remains one."

*Zhao’s commentary*: "‘What use is there for you?’ ‘Where could you go?’—this speaks of having no use for you. One may transform into something as minute as a mouse’s liver or a bug’s arm—this is unknowable."

The forging of metal into a sword is the work of the great smelter alone; the shaping of form into a human is the decree of the Master of Transformation alone. To become a mouse’s liver or a bug’s arm—how could I possibly know? *Cheng-ran* in sleep embodies the principle of total return; *lian-ran* in waking embodies the principle of revival.

Fuzhai observes: "Mouse liver and bug’s arm denote the most minute of things—this aligns with Zhaozhou’s saying of ‘after the fire has burned through, a single stalk of reeds remains.’ To follow the decree is to obey; to resist is to defy—this echoes the earlier idea that things cannot overcome Heaven. The analogy of forging metal is most striking. Jia Yi said: ‘Yin and yang are the charcoal; the myriad things are the copper—all emerge from this.’ *Cheng-ran* in sleep, *lian-ran* in waking—taking life as sleep and death as waking, yet these six characters conclude the preceding passage with such marvelous artistry.

The ancients spoke of friendship as that which is ‘in accord with the unobstructed’; thus could they correct one another when near death. When Zilai’s wife and children wept around him, he rebuked them to withdraw, lest they disturb his transformation—this was conduct unlike that of ordinary people. He further explained that one exists in the world as but one among the myriad things, and that the number of humans is beyond reckoning—so *what use is there for you?* This again dispelled his attachments and opened his boundless heart.

Mouse liver and bug’s arm speak of life in its most insignificant and negligible form. If even this is the decree of the Creator, one must accept it—how could it be resisted? From this, one sees that those who clearly understand the principle of life and death find joy in every circumstance and peace at all times. Extending this thread further, they can rescue friends from peril and resolve the confusions of the world—is this not a great benefit?

The Great Clod bears me with form until my death. Here, the earlier text is reiterated to address the common fear of death and the futile attempts to plan for future lives, where the slightest attachment entangles one for ten thousand kalpas. It is like metal leaping in the smelter—only to be bound and rendered unyielding by its own difference.

Thus, the perfected person takes Heaven and Earth as the furnace, the Creator as the smelter, and the boundless transformations as limitless—what need is there to cling to the label of ‘human’ and fret over its loss? How much less concern should there be for a mouse, a bug, a liver, or an arm? Observing how the ancients conducted themselves in this way, how could life and death ever constrain them? For they took life as sleep and death as waking. If death is waking, then what moment is not waking?

*The Eighteenth Fascicle of the* Ocean of Meanings of the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence*
Priest Chu Boxiu of Wulin

**The Fifth Chapter of the Inner Chapters: "No Master in Great Divination"**

Zisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Zi Qin Zhang became friends, saying to one another: "Who among us can join together in non-joining, act for one another in non-acting? Who can ascend to heaven and wander in the mists, stirring the boundless without end, forgetting one another in life, with no final limit?" The three looked at one another and laughed, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.

After some time, Zisang Hu died, his body yet unburied. When Confucius heard of this, he sent Zigong to attend to the rites. One wove cords, another plucked the zither, and together they sang in harmony:

*"Alas, Zisang Hu! Alas, Zisang Hu!*
*You have returned to your true nature,*
*While we remain here as men—how strange!"*

Zigong hurried forward and said: "May I ask—is it proper to sing before the dead?" The two looked at one another and laughed: "What does he know of the meaning of ritual?"

Zigong returned and reported to Confucius: "What manner of men are they? They cultivate no conduct, yet cast off their bodily forms. They sing before the dead without change in countenance—there is no name for them. What manner of men are they?"

Confucius said: "They wander beyond the bounds, while I wander within them. Beyond and within do not reach one another, and to send you to mourn them was my folly. They now join with the Creator as one, wandering in the single qi of heaven and earth. To them, life is but an excrescent growth, a hanging wart; death is the bursting of the wart, the draining of the abscess. For those like this, how could they know where life and death, before and after, reside? Borrowing from other things, they entrust themselves to a shared body, forgetting their livers and gallbladders, leaving behind their ears and eyes."

They cycle through beginning and end, unaware of origin or boundary;
adrift and wandering beyond the dust and grime,
at ease in the work of non-action.
How could they fret over the rites of the vulgar world,
seeking to please the eyes and ears of the multitude?

Zigong said: "Then upon what Way do you rely?"
Confucius said: "I am one of Heaven’s punished people."
"Yet even so, I share this with you."

Zigong said: "May I ask what this Way is?"
Confucius said: "Fish are made for water, as men are made for the Dao.
Those made for water dig ponds to sustain themselves;
those made for the Dao find stability without effort.
Thus it is said: fish forget one another in rivers and lakes,
men forget one another in the arts of the Dao."

Zigong said: "May I ask about the *jiren*?"
Confucius said: "The *jiren* is one who is odd among men yet companion to Heaven.
Thus it is said: what is petty in Heaven is noble among men;
what is noble among men is petty in Heaven."

Guo’s commentary:
Those who embody Heaven and Earth, who darkly merge with transformation—though hands and feet, the five viscera, never consciously cooperate, the hundred joints harmonize as one, cooperating in non-cooperation.
Though never consciously acting for one another, inner and outer together achieve their ends, acting in non-action.
But if one strains mind and will to care for hands and feet, moves limbs to tend the viscera, then the more one acts for them, the more inner and outer are exhausted.
To forget one’s life is to forget all things, to follow change and submit to transformation—where then is any limit?
They look at one another and laugh, hearts in perfect accord,
for they see the deepest kinship without the sentiment of love.
When others weep, they weep too—this is the crossroads of the vulgar world.
To sing before the dead is the aspiration of those beyond the bounds.

Those who grasp the meaning of ritual must wander outside to order what is within, guard the mother to preserve the child.
But if one prides oneself on reputation, is bound by emotional constraints,
then filial piety cannot bear sincerity, compassion cannot bear substance;
father and son, brothers, harbor feelings and deceive one another—
how could this be the great meaning of ritual?

There is a principle of ultimate depth, where inner and outer merge;
never has one who attains the utmost wandering beyond failed to merge within.
Mourning is a matter of those within the bounds—
to apply it to those beyond is folly.
To see life as an excrescent growth, a hanging wart—
qi gathering in its time, not what one delights in;
to see death as the bursting of the wart, the draining of the abscess—
qi scattering of itself, not what one regrets.
Life and death alternate, never beginning or ending—
thus one knows not where victory or defeat lie.
Gathering and scattering, transformation—all are different things.
Though what they borrow differs, together they form a single body.
Thus they forget liver and gallbladder, leave behind ears and eyes,
follow principle and proceed directly—
even the five viscera are forgotten, what thing remains to be known?
What they show to the multitude is but the dust and grime.

Lu’s commentary:
Cooperating in non-cooperation, acting in non-action—
this is the place of returning to the root and recovering destiny.
Ascend to Heaven and one reaches the great brightness above;
wander in mist and one enters the gate of profound obscurity—
thus stirred and prodded without limit, with no end or exhaustion.
For them, to return to the real is joy—
thus to sing before the dead is only fitting.
The former kings established ritual to balance likes and dislikes,
restoring the rightness of the human Way—
then for those who take joy in returning to the real,
how could this not be the meaning of ritual?

Those who wander beyond the bounds take Heaven as their companion,
thus they see death as joy and have no cause for sorrow.
Those who wander within the bounds take men as their companions,
thus they see death as sorrow and dare not rejoice.
If the many were to take these three as companions and delight in their death,
then those who double death and forget life would be legion.
Without these three, one is entangled between life and death,
unable to untie the knot—this is what the perfected lament.

The aspirations of inner and outer differ—
this is why they do not reach one another.
Confucius sent Zigong to mourn, wishing him to understand
that the meaning of ritual does not lie beyond the feelings of life and destiny,
and that the world’s subtle principles are not confined to ritual and law.

Wandering in the single qi of Heaven and Earth,
they are neither yin nor yang.
To see life as an excrescent growth is to see life as loss and indulge it;
to see death as the bursting of the abscess is to see death as return and delight in it.
Borrowing from different things, entrusting to a shared body—
this is not to take them as real.
Forgetting liver and gallbladder, leaving behind ears and eyes—
cycling through beginning and end, unaware of origin or boundary,
how then could they perform the rites of the vulgar world?

Confucius, though wandering within the bounds, extols the loftiness of those beyond—
Zigong suspects that though he wanders within, what he relies upon may not be there.
For what he wanders is the trace, while what he relies upon is the heart.
"Heaven’s punished people"—this means the Heavenly punishment is inescapable.
Yet Confucius embodies his nature, embraces the spirit,
and wanders the vulgar world at ease—
what reliance could burden his heart?
Thus he wanders within the bounds without needing to leave,
endures Heaven’s punishment without needing to escape.
This is not something I alone share with you—
I also draw fish as an analogy for men.
Digging a pond to sustain oneself does not require great waters;
finding stability without effort does not require wandering beyond.
To wander beyond and merge within,
to let each thing follow its nature so that the Way of emperors and kings is fulfilled—
this is to be odd among men yet companion to Heaven.
In terms of nature, there is no small or great among men;
in terms of human principle, those who companion Heaven may be called noble.
Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes,
men forget one another in the arts of the Dao—
each is self-sufficient and forgets the rest."

"To forget one another in rivers and lakes is not merely to dig a pond; to forget one another in the arts of the Dao is not merely to be without affairs. The odd man who companions Heaven does so by being external rather than internal.

Those whom Heaven deems petty and men deem noble are those starved by ritual and law yet ignorant of the true nature of life. As Lin notes: there is a Way of mutual accord, but no affairs of mutual accord; there is a heart of mutual endeavor, but no traces of mutual endeavor.

Ascending to heaven and roaming in mist—this is to reach the ultimate emptiness. Those who twist and turn do so beyond the bounds of creation. Those whose will is born with them do not cling to life. Without end or exhaustion, they have never died—they merely weave baskets and plait curtains.

Returning to the true self is still to be human, which is why a sigh of reliance arises. Zigong, perplexed, posed his question, and the two, seeing that Zigong did not grasp the meaning of ritual, exchanged smiles.

Cultivating one’s virtue and conduct without adherence to ritual and law, forgetting the body externally, equalizing life and death—such a Way is unfathomable and cannot be named.

Confucius said: 'He who wanders beyond the bounds and he who wanders within them—beyond the bounds lies the meaning of ritual, within them lies its form. The circumstances of inner and outer differ, and thus they do not intersect.'

To be a companion to the Creator is to render creation insufficient to match one’s use. To roam within the single qi of heaven and earth is to render heaven and earth insufficient to exhaust one’s longevity."

Those with superfluous growths and dangling warts—these are but confluences of qi. Those afflicted by sores, ulcers, and paralysis—these are but dispersals of qi. Strange entities are but transformations of life and death; the same body is but the six limbs, ears, and eyes. If strange entities are but illusions, how can the same body be real?

To forsake the inner and forget the outer, to know neither end nor beginning—this is to speak of merging with transformation as one. Confucius, constrained by benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and law, took these as ultimate limits, much like the inescapable bonds of heavenly punishment. Yet he could not but act thus, hence his words: "I share this with you."

Zigong, seeing that the three men did not conform to the human Dao, asked about "uncanny persons." Confucius replied: "Those who do not conform to the human Dao seek resemblance to the heavenly Dao. Those who accompany heaven speak of them as 'noble persons'; those who accompany humanity, lacking the words of heaven, speak of them as 'petty persons.' The sage, able to embody both heaven and humanity, harmonizes the myriad things—what need has he for 'uncanny persons' or 'accompanying heaven'?"

A detailed commentary on the Dao states: Form is what creation fashions; fate is what creation bestows. One who cannot accord with form will inevitably suffer constraint and aversion; one who cannot accord with fate will inevitably suffer distress and sorrow. Zisi accorded with form, and Zilai accorded with fate—though their paths differed, both took non-action as their head, life as their spine, and death as their tailbone, fundamentally the same. Yet according with form does not mean forgetting form, nor does according with fate mean forgetting fate.

But when the three friends ascended to roam the heavens and wander the mists, stirring and prodding the boundless—this was forgetting form. When they sang before the corpse without change in countenance—this was forgetting fate. To forget form is to forget one’s liver and gall, to forsake one’s ears and eyes. To forget fate is to reverse end and beginning, to know no origin or limit. Such are the deeds of those who wander beyond the bounds.

Confucius, however, dwelt within the bounds without refusal, accepting heavenly execution without avoidance. Unoccupied, he attained serenity; he did not require the beyond to find joy. Like fish weaving through ponds to sustain themselves, they need not the rivers and lakes to be at ease. Viewed through the Dao, who can say the petty person is not a noble one, or the noble person not petty? Yet when we speak of noble and petty persons in terms of their alignment with heaven or humanity, those three men were merely more worthy than heaven’s petty persons.

The sage harmonizes self and other, finding contentment in all circumstances—what need has he for the trivialities of "uncanny persons" or "accompanying heaven"?

The *Bixu* commentary states: To be without mutual engagement is to engage oneself; to be without mutual action is to act for oneself. To engage oneself is to govern oneself; to act for oneself is to act without acting—this is how one attains mutual forgetting. Ascending to roam the heavens and wander the mists is to tread loftily beyond the dust. Stirring and prodding without limit, one attains boundless emptiness—thus they forget one another in life, knowing no end or exhaustion.

Their arranging of songs and playing of lutes in harmony was not for Sanghu’s sake but to lament and admonish the multitude. Weeping and wailing are the forms of ritual; composure in life and acceptance in death are its essence. Those who cultivate the Way leave no trace of their words unfulfilled, yet their path cannot be named—who can say whether they are noble persons?

Those beyond the bounds grasp the subtle meaning; those within grasp the coarse traces. Those several men were about to roam with transformation through the great void, merging indistinguishably with the primordial chaos, taking life and death as the rise and fall of waves—how could they be bound by the fixed patterns of heaven and earth? Borne of the five phases’ strange entities, entrusted to creation’s single body, they cast off form and thus forgot liver and gall, discarded brilliance and thus forsook ears and eyes. Emerging from emptiness, entering the hollow, untouched by the world’s defilements, they attained the essence of the beyond—how could they perform the elaborate falsities of ritual to display before the multitude?

The enlightened make self-reliance their duty and regard reliance on the sagely path as disgrace. Thus, though the aims of sages and worthies differ, their responses to things remain unaltered. Fish find water and forget the waves; people attain the Dao and forget the road. Each weaves through its pond to nourish itself, unoccupied and preserving life.

To follow nature is to forget ritual and law; to cultivate ritual and law is to lose nature. Heaven’s petty persons are humanity’s noble ones—these are they who lose nature. Humanity’s noble persons are heaven’s petty ones—these are they who cultivate ritual and law. He who can unite both—is this not the way of Mengsun Cai?

The Zhao commentary states: To engage in non-engagement, reaching the point of no end or exhaustion—this is the Dao of the divine persons of Guye. The previous chapter spoke only of equalizing life and death; here, there are those who transcend both life and death.

Zifan and Qinzhang played lutes and sang in harmony, delighting in returning to the real, laughing at Zigong’s ignorance of ritual’s meaning. Confucius, understanding where their Dao resided, elucidated the subtlety of forgetting liver and gall, forsaking ears and eyes. Zigong then asked: "Master, will you rely on those beyond the bounds or those within?" Confucius replied: "You and I are both bound by ritual and law—this is an inescapable heavenly punishment."

Fish weave through ponds to find sustenance, seeking peace in water. Unoccupied, one attains serenity, seeking peace in the Dao. Fish do not depart from water, nor do people depart from the Dao—this is wandering within the bounds. To forget one another in rivers and lakes, to forget one another in the Dao’s unfolding—this is wandering beyond the bounds. The "uncanny person" does not conform to humanity but unites with heaven. The heavenly Dao is real; the human Dao is false—this is their distinction.

Fuzhai states: To engage without intent, to act without acting, ascending to roam the heavens and wander the mists, stirring and prodding the boundless—this is to wander beyond the myriad things. To forget one another in life, knowing no end or exhaustion, is to neither forget one’s beginning nor seek one’s end.

"Waiting upon affairs" refers to tasks like assisting in brewing or weaving mats. "Returning to the real" is returning to the origin. "The meaning of ritual" refers to ritual’s essence. Some say this is a parable of *Zhuangzi*. According to the *Book of Rites*, Yuan Rang’s *Lishou* song shows that since ancient times, there have been those who departed from the world and severed ties with custom—this did not await the learning of the Dao.

Cultivation without attainment—this speaks of the absence of virtue and practice. To be a companion to the Creator is to be a friend to the Creator. "Roaming the single qi of Heaven and Earth" means roaming the origin of things. "Growths, sores, and ulcers" are metaphors for this body as a superfluous thing in Heaven and Earth, which must be excised and dissolved before one is at ease—this is the meaning of toiling in life and resting in death. "Borrowing from other things, entrusting to the same body" refers to the theory that earth, water, fire, and wind combine to form the body. "Reversing and repeating end and beginning, unaware of their bounds"—then in wandering and freedom, where is there no fitting place?

Zigong asked the Master whether his reliance was on the inner or the outer realm. "Heaven’s punished people" refers to those under Heaven’s inescapable judgment, who thus cannot be people of the outer realm. "To share this with you" means to speak of the joy of the outer realm. "Digging a pond to nurture [fish]" is enough for self-sufficiency—this speaks of obtaining water, no matter the amount, and of attaining the Dao, where one lives according to one’s allotted measure. The *jiren*—the uniquely different person—thus accords with Heaven. If Heaven deems one a noble person, then people deem one base; if people deem one noble, then Heaven deems one base. What Zhuangzi calls a "noble person" carries a tone of mockery toward the sages and worthies, for he holds that rites, music, laws, and measures do not arise from nature. Only by breaking the measuring cups and smashing the scales, so that the people do not contend, does one become a noble person of Heaven. This is also an expression of indignation toward a perverse world, an excessively lofty argument.

"Being together without being together"—indifference perfects friendship. "Acting without acting"—tranquility perfects virtue. "Ascending to roam the heavens and wander the mists"—then one flies without constraint. "Forgetting one another in life"—then one is unaware of body and world. In freedom beyond things, where is there an end? A single smile without opposition—then spirit communes and hearts align, the Dao present in a glance. This is not like the shallow customs of later ages, where people discuss matters face-to-face but laugh behind one’s back.

When Zisang Hu died, Confucius sent Zigong to assist with the affairs—thus Zisang Hu’s character may be known. His two friends played the zither in harmony, delighting in returning to the real—thus their intent and interest were not far off. Zigong, versed in ritual and culture, was right to find this strange and ask about it. For the essence of ritual is known only to those who roam beyond the world, and the Master was not unaware of this. Sending Zigong to observe and provoke his question was meant to instruct him.

To be a companion to creation and roam the single qi of Heaven and Earth is to not divide the transformations of yin and yang. Thus life is seen as a growth, left to hang and attach; death as a sore or ulcer, ultimately to be dissolved and excised. How can one know where before and after lie? Borrowing the four great elements to form a body, blending inner and outer and forgetting both, reversing and repeating end and beginning, unaware of their bounds—this is the Dao of the great master.

Zigong again asked the Master which realm he relied upon. The Master said that teaching people through benevolence, righteousness, rites, and music is the utmost exhaustion of creation. "To share this with you" means that nothing escapes this. Fish rely on water to live; people rely on the Dao to live. Those at ease in water dig ponds to suffice; those at ease in the Dao live settled without affairs. This metaphor speaks of those who roam within the world, who are content within the world. As for forgetting one another in the expanse between rivers and lakes—this metaphor speaks of roaming beyond the world, unbound by worldly rites. Thus, in the face of the changes of life and death, one remains composed and unafraid.

Zigong, hearing of the customs of those beyond the world who leave society and cut ties with convention, asked about the *jiren*. The answer was that those who differ from people are companions to Heaven—this speaks of their defiance of convention necessarily harmonizing with the Dao. From this, one knows that Heaven’s base people are people’s noble ones, and people’s noble ones are Heaven’s base ones. The two lines are but one, clarifying the difference between differing and accompanying, and the divergence of Heaven and people.

Yan Hui asked Confucius: "Mengsun Cai—when his mother died, he wept without tears, his heart was not grieved, and he did not mourn in his dwelling. Lacking these three, he was praised throughout Lu for his skill in handling mourning. Is it truly possible to gain such a reputation without substance?" Hui was deeply puzzled by this.

Confucius said: "Mengsun Cai has fully realized it—he has advanced beyond knowledge. Though he sought to simplify, he could not, for he had already simplified. Mengsun Cai did not know why he lived, nor why he died; he did not know what to follow first, nor what to follow after. As if transformed into a thing, he awaited the transformations he did not know! And as he was about to transform, how could he know he would not transform? As he was about to not transform, how could he know he had already transformed? You and I are merely those who dream and have not yet awakened!

Moreover, he had a startled form but no harm to his heart; he had a morning dwelling but no feeling of death. Mengsun Cai alone was awake—others weep, and so he weeps. This is simply his way. Moreover, we have joined in calling this 'I'—how can we know what I call 'I'? You dream of being a bird and soaring in the sky, or of being a fish and diving into the abyss. Do you not know whether the speaker now is awake or dreaming?

When one reaches contentment, laughter does not follow; when laughter is offered, arrangement does not follow. At peace with arrangement and departing from transformation, one enters the vastness of the single Heaven." Guo’s commentary: "Those who fully grasp the principle of life and death and respond appropriately to inner and outer—acting in accordance with Heaven’s course—are not matched by knowledge. Selecting life and death without grasping their difference is like the progression of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. There is nothing one does not accept, and one becomes one with transformation. This is like forgetting what one knows in the present—how could one wait for knowledge to preemptively worry? Having transformed and lived, how can one know the time before life? Being in the midst of transformation and dying, how can one know the time after death?

Now, in dreams, one takes oneself to be awake—then there is no way to prove that waking is not dreaming, or that life is not death."

Life and death, waking and dreaming—one knows not where they reside. Yet in whatever one encounters, there is nothing that does not bring self-possession. Why grieve over this while worrying about that? To regard transformation as the body’s startling movements is not to let it harm or burden the heart. To see the body’s changes as a morning dwelling renewed is not to take them as death in one’s nature.

Those who remain constantly awake meet no situation without resistance, so when others weep, they weep too—this is simply what is fitting for them. Life and death, change and transformation—all are mine. Mysteriously one with inner and outer, ever renewed with transformation, how could one know where I truly am? Dreaming of being a bird, dreaming of being a fish—there is nowhere one does not find self-possession. The changes of life and death are never worth lamenting. All one creates is fitting, so one does not reach laughter.

"Arranging" means "shifting." In ritual, weeping must be sorrowful, laughter must be joyful—if sorrow and joy linger in the heart, one cannot shift with what is fitting. Now, Mengsun always fits, at ease with shifting. Moving together with transformation, he thus enters into the vast emptiness and becomes one with Heaven.

Lü’s commentary: Only when one knows that things have never truly begun does one see no difference between inner and outer, life and death. Why must one wander beyond the world, taking death as joy, even singing before the corpse? Thus, in mourning, Mengsun weeps as others do, yet is not burdened by sorrow—this is how he differs from them. Therefore, the example of Mengsun shows that the utmost attainment does not depart from the common ways of the world. In life, it is still so; in death, it is still so; in weeping, it is still so—though one may wish to select, one cannot.

Those three masters, though unaware of where life, death, existence, and extinction reside, took life as loss and death as return—yet they did not truly know the reason for life or the reason for death. Taking the return to the real as joy, sighing for others—this was not yet to be free from attachment to before or after. Mengsun, however, did not know the reason for life or the reason for death, so in life there was nothing lost, and in death there was nothing to return to. Free from attachment to before or after, in death there was nothing to delight in, and in life there was nothing to sigh over.

Not only was it like this, but even if one were transformed into another thing, one would still await that unknown transformation, and it too would remain unknown. When about to transform, how could one know it will not transform? When about to remain unchanged, how could one know it has already transformed? Then are we now, together with you, not yet awakened from the dream?

He who has a human form may be startled by its changes, yet his heart remains unmoved—thus nothing harms the heart. Life and death are like night and day, so there is a morning dwelling. Without the emotions of others, there is no emotional death. This is why Mengsun alone was awakened.

Only by knowing this does one weep when others weep, without tears that are not sorrowful—this arises from what is fitting for them and is nothing strange. Moreover, when you dream of being a bird or a fish, you do not know it is a dream. Then how can one be certain whether what is now spoken is waking or dreaming? This makes clear that Mengsun forgot the self and alone was awakened.

What brings laughter is fitting, yet it is not self-fitting—thus one does not reach laughter. Laughter is what arranges, yet if one offers laughter, it is not joyful laughter—thus one does not reach arrangement. "Arrangement" means dispelling sorrow and letting it go. Thus, Mengsun’s forgetting of life and death cannot be created or offered. Being at ease with arrangement is not to arrange with intention; letting go of transformation is to know it cannot be resisted and to follow it.

Vastness is without obstruction, Heaven is without human artifice, oneness is without duality—the Dao is fully realized here.

Yi Du’s commentary: Few know life but not death; Mengsun knew what others did not, thus daily advancing in knowledge. At ease with life, at ease with death—what selection could there be? What Mengsun selected was the Dao, not knowing the difference between life and death to avoid or pursue them.

Transformation comes uninvited and leaves untraceable. Forgetting and awaiting it, one responds when principle arrives. Only what transformation cannot move is the principle of understanding life and penetrating death. Thus, when about to transform, how could one know it will not transform? When about to remain unchanged, how could one know it has already transformed? All attachments to the world are dreams. Once truly awakened, life and death cannot burden one—how much less the rites of the world?

When Mengsun’s mother died, seeing others startled, he too was startled, yet his heart was not harmed. Morning belongs to the arising of yang; form is likened to a dwelling. Ordinary people follow form with their emotions, so both emotion and form die. The perfected person knows form is not one’s own, regarding it as a morning dwelling. Thus, the form may die, but the nature does not die. Mengsun cast off the dust and alone awakened—thus he is called "alone awakened."

The *Shuowen* says: "乃 depicts the difficulty of qi emerging." Mengsun’s weeping did not come from his original heart but followed others in weeping—this is why it was difficult.

My life, my death—nowhere is it not mine. Dreaming of being a bird, dreaming of being a fish, one is at ease with whatever is encountered. Do we not know whether what is now said is spoken in waking or in dreaming? Not having penetrated the principle of life and death, even in waking one is still in a dream. Once truly awakened, there is no longer waking or dreaming.

Fitting by chance, fitting is not constant—if one forces it, one does not reach laughter. Laughing for others when the heart is not joyful—this is offering laughter. "Arrangement" is the principle of shifting with creation. Only one who is fitting in all situations reaches laughter. Only one who is joyful then laughs reaches arrangement. Thus, the perfected person is at ease with shifting, forgets transformation, enters into vastness, and becomes one with Heaven.

Xiang Dao’s commentary: Mengsun’s mastery of mourning was the Dao. Yan Hui’s reproach was emotion. Mengsun could not select what he selected—what he selected and took was only the Dao. Moreover, how could one know where life and death, before and after, reside? Those who are bound to form and burdened by life follow the emotions of ordinary people.

One whose form is startled yet whose heart remains unharmed does not submit to form. One who dwells in the morning abode yet feels no sorrow in death is not burdened by life. Thus, one follows what lies in the other without resistance—hence, when others weep, one weeps. One rests in what lies within oneself without worry—hence, though one weeps, there is no grief. For ease arises from what brings comfort, and laughter springs from what brings joy; forcing ease does not lead to laughter, and laughing for others cannot be arranged and cast aside.

Mengsun’s heart knew neither sorrow nor joy—he merely wept when others wept, which is called "offering" it. That he did not reach grief was fitting, for he was at ease with shifting without harm to his heart, released from transformation without sorrow in death, and thus entered into vastness to become one with Heaven.

Bixu’s commentary: Weeping and wailing while observing mourning rites is the ritual of serving the dead. Without tears, there is no grief—this is the Way of understanding death, which only those who fully practice it and advance in knowledge attain. Seeing life and death as a single thread, nothing can be discarded. Though one may simplify life and death, one cannot simplify weeping and wailing. Avoidance and pursuit are the emotions of ordinary people.

Now, those who possess form are transformed by things, and things follow their transformations. When transformation is imminent, how can one know whether death enters emptiness and vastness and will not become human again? When transformation is not imminent, how can one know whether life dwells in fleeting shadows and is lost in the blink of an eye? Form follows transformation and shifts—hence, there is startled form. The heart is one with emptiness and vastness—hence, there is no harm to the heart.

Form is but the temporary union of spirit. Today, one dwells in it and tends to it; tomorrow, it is cast aside as a discarded thing. Only the enlightened follow change and remain ever-living—hence, there is no sorrow in death. *The Shuowen* says: "乃 depicts the difficulty of qi’s emergence," referring to the challenge of forgetting sorrow and grief when weeping is not easy. Life is mine, death is mine—thus, it is said, "together with me." The perfected person has no self—where is there a place that is not me? Dreaming of being a fish or a bird, soaring through the sky or plunging into the abyss, is no different.

People have long been deluded by the illusions of life and death, waking and dreaming, not realizing that those who dwell in long light have no waking or dreaming, and those who transcend form have no life or death. Forced ease and joy do not reach laughter; natural offerings of laughter do not reach the countenance. Arrangement has no foothold.

Mengsun was at ease with arrangement, undisturbed by transformation, and thus entered into the vastness of Heaven, merging into oneness without duality.

Zhao’s commentary: When Mengsun’s mother died, he felt no grief, yet his mastery of mourning brought him fame throughout Lu. The Master said Mengsun had fully grasped the principle of life and death, reaching the realm of ultimate knowledge. Yet he could not but observe mourning and weep—this is what is meant by "unable to discard." However, without sorrow or grief, he had already discarded something.

Not knowing the origin of life and death, before and after, he served his mother in life and death as one. If she had transformed into another thing, that which he did not know—neither born nor transformed—how could he wait for what he did not know to transform with her before stopping? What transforms is form; what does not transform is not form. How can the transforming and the untransforming know one another?

Having startled form yet no harm to the heart, dwelling in the morning abode yet no sorrow in death—this is what is meant by "possessing human form but not human emotions." The Master said to Yan Hui: "You and I have not yet awakened," but Mengsun had already awakened. Weeping when others weep, not knowing why—this is the morning. Morning is life, night is death. The world clings to life as the self, unaware that it is but the morning of night.

What I call "me" endures through ancient and present times, ever-present. Dreaming of being a fish or a bird—does one know it is a dream? Is there any difference between speaking of dreams now and being in a dream? One who creates ease finds contentment in all situations—hence, does not reach laughter. One who offers laughter rejoices at the trigger—hence, cannot arrange and cast it aside. At ease with the Creator’s arrangement, detached from the realm of ceaseless transformation, one ascends to the distant and becomes a companion of Heaven.

Yongzhai said: "Advancing in knowledge" means progressing ever further in understanding the Dao. "Unable to discard" refers to the rites of mourning and the act of weeping, which one still wishes to cast aside but cannot. Though unable to discard, what one does is already greatly simplified.

"Not knowing the origin of life and death, before and after" means being unable to discern beginning or end, following creation as a thing, awaiting the transformation one does not know. This is to let things take their natural course. How can one know what will transform, what has already transformed, or what will not transform? Those who know the Dao find my actions strange—this is because my dream has not yet awakened.

Form changes with age, which may be startling, but the heart remains at ease—hence, no harm to the heart. *Dan* is life; *zhai* is dwelling; life and death are like night and morning. Knowing that life’s dwelling is temporary, death is not truly death—hence, there is no sorrow in death. "Awakened, one weeps when others weep"—this is merely following the crowd. This is where one wishes to discard but cannot.

This is the subtlety of self-attainment: wishing to discard yet unable, one follows the crowd in weeping. Moreover, those who now join me in finding this strange—how can they know what I truly mean by "me"? This is Zhuangzi’s playful flourish in his writing; the reader must view it with a separate eye.

Dreaming of birds or fish is but an extension of the earlier transformation into a butterfly. Speaking now—whether awake or dreaming—is like Zhuang Zhou dreaming of being a butterfly, or the butterfly dreaming of being Zhuang Zhou. When the mind is set on something, there are times it does not reach laughter—this is the intensity of ease. Laughing in response to things is when things silently laugh at me, arising naturally—what need is there for arrangement?

All things in the world—success and failure, gain and loss—are already arranged. I merely rest in what is arranged and follow transformation, thus entering into vastness, Heaven, and oneness. Vastness, Heaven, and oneness are but creation, given such names.

The preceding chapter tells of Zisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai as friends—Ziyu’s body was afflicted yet his heart remained untroubled; Zilai faced death yet his spirit felt no dread: both had grasped the principle and followed transformation. The next chapter speaks of Zisanghu’s death, where his two friends strummed the zither and sang in harmony, forgetting form and delighting in transformation. In this chapter, mourning his mother, he wished to simplify rites but could not, so he wept without tears and his heart felt no sorrow. Unknowing of whence life comes or whither death goes, how could he know that lurching and wailing were proper to ritual?

The greater meaning is to clarify that life and death are not to be distinguished, urging one to rest in and follow them, to delight in and forget them. The living are not crushed, the dead are spared terror, and where the spirit’s way reaches, joy flows freely—then the root and refuge of one’s being will not lodge in a body of violence. Observe the transformations of cicadas, butterflies, and dragonflies: their principle may be extended. On the verge of change, poised and still, they know no division between self and other, but harmonize with the qi of Heaven and Earth. Thus, one may discourse on the shell here while the form transforms there. During transformation, if mistakenly touched by another creature, the intent turns to anger and shifts into a malign kind—mind changes within, form alters without, for something has summoned it. Though transformation arises from the Creator, it also reveals how things shape themselves. How can one not be vigilant of this mechanism?

What the heart inclines toward becomes its fulfillment; in fulfillment, true joy is inwardly complete, not dependent on laughter for its presence. Laughter in response to things is but offered mirth; silent laughter arises from strain and falls short of the naturalness of spontaneous arrangement. The rise and fall of things depend on the Creator’s arrangement; human sorrow and joy depend on what that arrangement brings. To rest in arrangement and follow transformation is to enter into vastness and merge with the natural, where Heaven and humanity blend without duality.

This speaks of Mengsun’s clarity in destiny and mastery of change, his following of transformation and forgetting of emotion, taking life and death as but night and day, lodging waking and dreaming within them—how could sorrow or joy bind him? Someone asked: Mengsun forgot emotion in life and death, his heart free of grief—this is understanding, but applied to mourning his mother, does it not show filial impiety and violate ritual, making him a transgressor of moral teaching? The answer: Those beyond the world repay their parents in substance, not in form. There is something in hidden merits and secret conduct, in dissolving karmic knots and attaining the marvel of preserving spirit and transcending transformation—how could they stoop to the trifling rites of the vulgar? Once, Confucius’ friend Yuan Rang, upon his mother’s death, climbed a tree and sang—an even more extreme case! Confucius passed by as if he heard nothing and ultimately did not reproach him. This is the distinction between wandering within and beyond the world, the difference between ritual propriety and inner truth. Without profound insight, one cannot speak of this.

*The Sixth Inner Chapter: The Great and Venerable Teacher*

Yi’erzi sought an audience with Xu You.
Xu You asked, “How has Yao endowed you?”
Yi’erzi replied, “Yao instructed me: ‘You must personally embody benevolence and righteousness, and clearly distinguish right from wrong.’”
Xu You said, “Then why have you come to court? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness, and mutilated you with right and wrong—how will you wander the paths of boundless freedom, unconstrained roaming, and ceaseless transformation?”
Yi’erzi said, “Even so, I wish to wander within its bounds.”
Xu You said, “It cannot be. The blind cannot partake in the beauty of brows and eyes, nor the blind in the splendor of blue and yellow, embroidered and patterned robes.”
Yi’erzi said, “Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength, and the Yellow Emperor lost his wisdom—all within the crucible of refinement. How do we know the Creator will not cease branding me and mend my mutilation, allowing me to ride perfection and follow you, Master?”
Xu You said, “Alas, it cannot be known. Let me speak to you of its general principles: O my teacher! O my teacher!”

The Way nurtures the ten thousand things yet claims no righteousness; its blessings extend through the ages yet claim no benevolence; it is older than high antiquity yet claims no eld; it sustains heaven and earth, sculpts the myriad forms, yet claims no artistry. Such is the realm in which I wander.

Guo’s annotation: Branding with benevolence and righteousness, mutilating with right and wrong—this is to mar oneself with form-bound teachings, unable to roam the fields of self-attained freedom. Yi’erzi dares not seek the central path and wishes only to advance to its fence. Xu You disagrees, for not all things in the world are self-complete; some must be smelted and forged into vessels. Thus, Wu Zhuang, Ju Liang, and the Yellow Emperor all heard the Dao and only then lost what they had pursued. This is but a borrowed metaphor to dispel the burdens of action. That which proceeds unwavering and direct is nature itself. To proceed and harm one’s nature, and then to correct that harm, is also nature. How do we know that my nature will not cease its branding and mend my mutilation, allowing me to ride the perfected Way and follow you, Master?

The Way nurtures and blesses the ten thousand things—all occurs of itself, without preference or aversion. Where, then, could the seven virtues be lodged? Thus, though it appears ever-new, it is not artifice. To wander in non-action, to take no master as master—this alone suffices.

Lü’s annotation: The great thoroughfare of the Dao is the path of boundless freedom, unconstrained roaming, and ceaseless transformation. Wu Zhuang was ensnared by her beauty; Ju Liang was ensnared by his strength; the Yellow Emperor fasted in mind and disciplined his form to return to non-knowing, yet initially could not avoid employing knowledge. The crucible is for smelting and casting, the hammer for forging and refining. The loss of their burdens was not innate but occurred within the process of smelting and refining. How, then, do we know the Creator will not cease my branding and mend my mutilation, allowing me to ride my perfected heart-mind and follow the Master’s non-action?

That which nurtures and blesses the ten thousand things, which is older than high antiquity, which sculpts the myriad forms—this is what I wander within and take as my teacher. If you wish to cease your branding and mend your mutilation, take this alone as your teacher.

Lin’s annotation: To embody benevolence and righteousness is to fulfill one’s nature; to clarify right and wrong is to exhaust principle. Yao governed the world within the realm of forms, hence his admonition to Yi’erzi. Xu You said: Since Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness, mutilated you with right and wrong, why have you come? "Boundless freedom" means far-reaching vastness; "unconstrained roaming and ceaseless transformation" describe a state of coming and going at ease. Yi’erzi, having awakened to the constraints of benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong, now wishes to wander within the fence of the Dao. Xu You uses the blind and deaf as metaphors, yet Yi’erzi, eager to receive teaching, cites the three who lost their beauty, strength, and wisdom—all within the crucible’s refining. The attainment of the Dao also comes through learning. How do we know the Creator will not cease and mend my branding and mutilation, allowing me to ride the perfected Way and follow the Master? Xu You says all things create themselves; both I and the world are unknowable—one can only merge with the obscure. "O my teacher!" refers to the Dao.

To shatter the ten thousand things yet claim no righteousness is akin to losing a state yet retaining the people’s hearts. For the ten thousand things are all natural—where could the names of benevolence and righteousness be lodged? To be older than high antiquity yet claim no eld speaks to the Dao’s timelessness. To sustain heaven and earth is the Dao’s substance; to sculpt the myriad forms is its function. Such is the realm in which I wander.

Detailed Daoist annotation: Those of old who discoursed on the Dao underwent two transformations to reach righteousness, eight to reach right and wrong. Benevolence and righteousness are the Dao’s dispersion; right and wrong are further refinements of righteousness. Thus, the harm of the seven virtues is like branding, and the harm of right and wrong is like mutilation. To lose one’s knowledge is to attain non-knowing, which surpasses the loss of beauty or strength. Xu You says the blindness and deafness caused by benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong cannot lead to the Dao. Yi’erzi claims that beauty, strength, and knowledge, once refined and discarded, can all lead to the Dao. Thus, what was previously marred can be mended and ceased; what is later perfected comes through instruction. To shatter the ten thousand things is not to oppose them; to bless the ages is not to love them. To be older than high antiquity is to be ever-new; to sculpt the myriad forms without artifice is to conceal its function. Can one who does not wander beyond benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong achieve this?

Bi Xu’s annotation: To take sagely traces as punishments—where, then, can one wander in the fields of untrammeled freedom, unbound and self-attained? Those endowed with knowledge, strength, and beauty find these difficult to relinquish, yet all are lost upon hearing the Dao. This speaks of how even sages and worthies rely on forging and refining to perfect their natures—how much more so those of middling or lesser talent? Though now marred by sagely progress, how do we know the Creator will not mend and cease this? For the nature’s emptiness and numinosity—what harm do branding and mutilation bring? Now, riding this perfected nature to follow the Master—what doubt remains? The Dao as teacher has never borne the names of benevolence and righteousness. That you now bear the disgrace of branding and mutilation—is this not strange? Only when light and shadow both vanish can one wander the realm of the Dao.

Zhao’s annotation: Xu You said to Yi’erzi: Since Yao has branded and mutilated you with benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong, you can no longer enjoy the joy of untrammeled wandering. Yi’erzi wishes to wander within its fence, so Xu You admonishes him with the blind and deaf. Yi’erzi then awakens to how benevolence, righteousness, right, and wrong in his heart indeed harm the Dao. He cites beauty, strength, and knowledge as examples, saying that once refined in the great crucible, all becomes clear. How do we know my branding will not cease and my mutilation be mended? "O my teacher!" refers to the Dao I take as my teacher. What I call benevolence and righteousness are not what you call benevolence and righteousness. The yin’s desolation and the killing of the ten thousand things—this is not righteousness. The yang’s expansion and the birth of the ten thousand things—this is not benevolence.

Spanning from ancient times to the present—this is not old age. Encompassing all with its winding completeness—this is not craft. Such is my Way, and nothing more; it is here that one must wander.

Yongzhai says: "Yáodàng" means to roam freely. "Zìwéi" means to move without constraint. "Zhuǎnxǐ" means to transform and shift. The metaphor of the blind and deaf means you lack the capacity to hear the Dao. Yi’erzi says: abandon old habits and awaken on your own—this transformation occurs in an instant. I wish to follow the principles of nature in serving my teacher. Xu You sighs that this is not yet certain, for he does not yet know if you can truly do so.

From "O my teacher!" onward, the text reveals the great theme of this chapter: to act without acting, to be natural and spontaneous, without imposing my own intentions. Thus, it cannot be named benevolence or righteousness. As the *Yijing* says: "It drums all things into motion yet shares no sage’s worries"—this is the same idea. The phrases "older than high antiquity" and the following two lines all describe the natural Dao.

When the mind wanders in the natural, one sees that heaven and earth are born together with me, and the ten thousand things and I are one. Such is the realm in which I wander—nothing more.

Xu You embodies absolute non-action, forgetting even the world. Yao cannot escape action, seeking to benefit all under heaven. To forget all is to be at ease while the world transforms; to benefit all is to toil while the world rests. The sage’s emergence and withdrawal create the distinction between the inner and outer realms. What differs is the outward trace; what is the same is the heart.

To personally practice benevolence and righteousness, to clearly distinguish right and wrong—this is the learning of the inner realm. To roam freely, move without constraint, and transform without cease—this is the wandering of the outer realm. Yi’erzi, branded and mutilated by the rites and teachings of the inner realm, hears these words and awakens in his heart. He wishes to abandon the inner realm and wander in the outer, a noble aspiration indeed—but Xu You does not yet grant it.

Yi’erzi then cites three men of exceptional natural endowment who, upon hearing the Dao, were transformed. Thus, my coming here is also within the process of refinement and tempering. Those who study the Dao seek to return to their original state, preserve their wholeness, and avoid harm. Once branded and mutilated, to hope the Creator will cease the branding and mend the mutilation—is this not difficult? If one truly understands that things shape themselves, then what is called branding and mutilation also lies in self-cessation and self-mending. What has the Creator to do with it?

Yi’erzi says: if by chance the branding can cease and the mutilation be mended, I will become whole again. Seizing this opportunity for wholeness, I will follow my teacher and advance toward the Dao—it is not too late. People often persist in their errors without correction, lost without thought of return. Yi’erzi’s awakening to yesterday’s wrongs and today’s truths can be called a true return.

What people take as their teacher is the Dao. "O my teacher!" refers to the Dao. The following four lines elucidate the Dao of the great master, transcending benevolence and righteousness to span past and present. It arises from non-action and transformation without transformation—how could worldly skill or craft compare? To "wander" is to roam contentedly within it, finding boundless freedom everywhere. Thus, the text does not speak of it repeatedly.

Yan Hui says: "I am healed!"

Confucius said: "What do you mean?"
Yan Hui replied: "I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness!"
Confucius said: "Good! But it is still not enough."

Another day, they met again, and Yan Hui said: "I am healed!"
Confucius asked: "What do you mean?"
Yan Hui replied: "I have forgotten ritual and music!"
Confucius said: "Good! But it is still not enough."

On yet another day, they met again, and Yan Hui said: "I am healed!"
Confucius asked: "What do you mean?"
Yan Hui replied: "I have attained *zuowang*—sitting in forgetfulness!"
Confucius started in surprise and said: "What is *zuowang*?"
Yan Hui said: "I have cast off my limbs and body, dimmed my hearing and sight, departed from form and abandoned knowledge, merging with the Great Thoroughfare—this is called *zuowang*."
Confucius said: "To merge is to be without preferences; to transform is to be without constancy. You are truly worthy! I, Qiu, would follow after you."

Guo’s commentary: Yanzi’s healing lies in reduction, while the Master spoke of benevolence as the advance of universal love and righteousness as the achievement of things. Love is not benevolence, yet benevolence is enacted through it; achievement is not righteousness, yet righteousness is manifest in it. To retain benevolence and righteousness is insufficient to comprehend the spontaneous arising of love and benefit—thus, forgetting them is permissible. Yet merely forgetting their traces still does not reach profound attainment. Ritual is the function of the body, and music is the instrument of joyful life; forgetting the instruments is not as good as forgetting that which produces them. *Zuowang* means not only advancing toward the goal but also forgetting the means of advancement—internally unaware of one’s own body, externally oblivious to heaven and earth. Only then can one merge vast and empty with transformation, becoming one with it in all things. Without difference from things, there is no place that is not fitting—thus, without preferences or aversions, one merges with transformation. Since transformation is always fitting, there is no constancy.

Lü’s commentary: Humanity has been human for so long—though enlightenment may dawn in a single word, returning to nothingness is not the work of a day. When Yan Hui heard of fasting the mind and ceased to be himself, he awakened to the Dao in a single word. His forgetting of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music, culminating in *zuowang*, was not the achievement of a day. To merge is to see all things as one, hence without preferences; to transform is to have no fixed limit, hence without constancy. To merge with the Great Thoroughfare is simply to merge with transformation.

Lin’s commentary: Forgetting benevolence and righteousness and advancing to forget ritual and music still does not depart from boundaries—there is still something. Advancing further to nothingness, the limbs and body are cast off, hearing and sight are dimmed. Departing from form and abandoning knowledge, merging with the Great Thoroughfare—this is the ultimate. Casting off and dimming still involve effort; departing and abandoning are natural. Merging with the Great Thoroughfare is becoming one with things. Preferences and aversions arise from difference; in oneness, there are no preferences or aversions. To command the myriad things is called transformation; in transformation, there is no constancy. Yan Hui could become one with things and merge with transformation. I, too, wish to follow after him—this is Confucius’ humble expression.

Xiang Dao’s commentary: If one takes streams as the sea, one sees the streams but not the sea; if one gathers the hundred streams into the sea, one sees the sea but not the streams. The Dao is the sea; benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are the streams. Yan Hui attained the Dao and forgot benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—this is seeing the sea and forgetting the streams, yet the Dao is still not forgotten. When one departs from form and forgets things, abandons knowledge and forgets the mind, resting serenely without entanglement—where, then, is the Dao? It is forgotten along with the self—this is Yan Hui’s worthiness. Righteousness is close to ritual, and benevolence is close to music; thus, one forgets ritual after forgetting righteousness, and forgets music after forgetting benevolence. Yan Hui’s forgetting still had something not forgotten, and his healing involved reduction. Not forgetting what is to be forgotten, one returns to true forgetting; reducing again and again, one reaches non-reduction. Without attaining the subtlety of *zuowang*, how could one reach this?

Bi Xu’s commentary: Yanzi’s healing refers to reducing the external to heal the internal. Loving things is called benevolence; benefiting things is called righteousness. Love and benefit belong to the external—forgetting them is permissible, but it is not yet the Dao. Ritual is the dignity of the body; music is the harmony of the heart-mind. The heart-mind and body belong to the internal—forgetting them is permissible, but it is not yet the Dao. *Zuowang* is forgetting without cease. Casting off the limbs and body means responding and then forgetting; dimming hearing and sight means illuminating and then forgetting. Responding and then forgetting is departing from form and abandoning knowledge; illuminating and then forgetting is merging with the Great Thoroughfare. One’s body merges with the great emptiness, hence without preferences or aversions; the heart-mind merges with creation and transformation, hence without permanence or constancy.

Zhao’s commentary: A noble person cannot abandon benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music for a single day. When Yanzi’s heart-mind fused with principle, the names of these four vanished, and he forgot them. Casting off the limbs and body is departing from form; dimming hearing and sight is abandoning knowledge. Merging with the Great Thoroughfare is becoming one with the Dao. The Master’s intent was that preferences and aversions are both relinquished, constancy and change are both dissolved—this is what is called merging, this is what is called transformation. If you are truly capable of this, I will take you as my teacher—though I suspect it may not be so. To speak of casting off and dimming, of departing and abandoning, is still to have intention—it cannot be called true attainment.

Yongzhai said: The discourse on *zuowang* is Zhuangzi’s use of Yanzi’s name to depict the subtlety of attaining the Dao. To speak of attainment, one first forgets benevolence and righteousness, then forgets ritual and music—this is putting the world outside oneself, then putting the myriad things outside. Reaching *zuowang*, both being and non-being are relinquished; the four limbs and senses are no longer self-aware, merging with the Dao of the Great Thoroughfare. Becoming one with the Dao is transformation; in transformation, there is no abiding, and the heart-mind arises. Benevolence and righteousness originate in the heart-mind—when the heart-mind attains emptiness, forgetting them is easy. Ritual and music arise from habit—once habits are long established, forgetting them is difficult. Yanzi had already forgotten both, thus accomplishing what others find difficult. Yet the Master still deemed it insufficient, wishing to advance him toward the ultimate of the Dao—here one sees the intent behind refining Yanzi.

When others reach this point, they would gaze at the precipice and turn back! Yet Yanzi advanced further into the subtleties of *zuowang*, prompting the Master to exclaim in astonishment and inquire in reverse, marveling at how swiftly he had attained it. Yan Hui replied that by relinquishing form and discarding knowledge, one merges with the Great Thoroughfare; only after forgetting the self can one forget things—this is *zuowang*. To merge without knowing why one merges is the Dao of the Great Thoroughfare—how could it be a matter of willfully seeking union?

It is like the ceaseless movement of the great transformation, which never pauses for an instant. As one abides within it, one moves in unison with it—from the ignorance of childhood to the wisdom of maturity, from the toil of adulthood to the ease of old age, through the vicissitudes of withdrawal and engagement, activity and stillness, rise and fall, change and transition—what constancy could there be? For it is not that one desires transformation and seeks it; the principles of things unfold naturally, the same from ancient times to the present. Only those who attain the Dao may choose not to transform, yet even they cannot help but forget—these two lines serve as the Master’s verification of the *zuowang* episode.

He wished for others to seek unity amid diversity, to find constancy in transformation, to embody truth through forgetting, and to merge with the Dao in emptiness—then would they reach the ultimate! The utmost! If one can truly refrain from allowing external habits to obscure the pristine purity within, then *zuowang* becomes but a natural part of the path of learning the Dao. The Master extolled Yanzi as worthy, thereby encouraging his progress and guiding his disciples.

Ziyu and Zisang were friends, and after ten days of continuous rain, Ziyu said: "Zisang must be in dire straits!"

He wrapped rice and went to feed him. Arriving at Zisang’s gate, he heard sounds like singing, like weeping—plucking the zither, Zisang cried: "Father! Mother! Heaven! Man!" His voice could not bear the strain, yet he hastened to recite his verse.

Ziyu entered and asked: "Why do you sing your poem in this manner?"
Zisang replied: "I ponder who has brought me to this extremity, yet I cannot find the answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; earth bears all without favor—would heaven and earth single me out for poverty? I seek the one who has done this, yet I cannot find him. Thus, I have reached this extremity—it is fate!"

Guo’s commentary: These two men assist each other in what is no assistance at all. Now, wrapping rice to bring and feed him is simply the natural course of heaven’s principle, not an act done only after considering aid. Zisang plucks the zither and mournfully sings, seeking the one who has done this yet finding none—this shows that all things arise naturally, without any doer.

Lü’s commentary: In *The Great Master*, Zhuangzi concludes with Mengsun Cai and Yan Hui, holding them as those who, like Confucius’ disciples, embody their nature, embrace the spirit, and follow the Dao in navigating the world—only then do they reach perfection. Yet he feared that scholars might deem Zisang’s followers inferior to Mengsun’s, or Ziyu’s inferior to Ziduo’s, and so he combined them in discussion. Their words all come to rest in fate, accepting it with equanimity. Though the paths of these masters differ, they share the Dao as their great master and ultimately converge in fate.

Lin’s commentary: Zisang forgets form and abandons life, so when afflicted by illness, he does not regard it as illness—he ascribes it all to fate alone. His voice could not bear the strain, for his strength was diminished by illness, and thus he recited his verse with such urgency. Parents are the closest of kin; heaven and earth are the most impartial. Would they single me out for poverty? Seeking the one who has done this yet finding none, he concludes it is merely fate! All transformations return to a single fate—this is the ultimate of the Dao.

Bixu’s commentary: To clothe the cold and feed the hungry is like fish moistening each other with foam—it is not feigned sentiment. His voice could not bear the strain—he was exhausted. Hastening to recite his verse, it lacked coherence. At the extremity of poverty and illness, seeking the one who has done this yet finding none, he ultimately ascribes it to fate. Accepting fate, nothing remains impassable.

Zhao’s commentary: Zisang endures poverty and accepts fate, just as the Master, beset in Chen and Cai, never ceased his zither and song, and Yanzi, dwelling in a narrow alley, never altered his joy—their resolve was the same. Yongzhai said: "His voice could not bear the strain"—his strength was weak, and his voice faint. 'Hastening to recite his verse'—his emotions were constrained, and his words pressed. 'Would my parents wish me to be poor? Would heaven and earth single me out for poverty?'—these words are most exquisite. Seeking the one who has done this yet finding none, he ascribes it to fate, for the principle of nature stands above heaven and earth. Fate is the principle of nature—this is what is called the Great Master. In this passage, *Zhuangzi* surpasses *Liezi’s* "Power and Fate."

In ancient times, what was called friendship entailed mutual support in the Dao and virtue, the completion of character and achievement, aid in times of peril, and unwavering loyalty unto death. Observing Ziyu’s conduct toward Zisang, one sees no shame in the way of friendship: troubled by the rain, he feared Zisang’s illness, knowing his poverty; wrapping rice to bring and feed him, he knew Zisang’s hunger; entering the gate and hearing his song, he asked in alarm, fearing Zisang’s distress might lead to resentment and the loss of his integrity. Zisang’s words—"Would my parents wish me to be poor? Would heaven and earth single me out for poverty?"—can be called the discourse of a transcendent man, unshaken by hardship. Yet to still feel emotion in such extremity shows he had not yet forgotten it entirely. Later, ascribing it to fate, he overcame with reason and handled it with principle, leaving Ziyu speechless.

The *Nanhua* uses this to conclude the purport of *The Great Master*, echoing *The Western Inscription*: "Poverty, lowliness, sorrow, and grief jade you to completion"—for without long polishing and utmost cultivation, one is not fit for great tasks. Those who study the Dao should deeply embody this.

The multitudes of people and things are governed by the ruler. The multitudes of disciples are instructed by the teacher. Heaven produces the sage and worthy to serve as rulers and teachers, establishing the foundations of governance, expanding the wellsprings of transformation, so that people may know the reverence due to virtue and power, and the inquiry owed to nature and fate. Thus, the bonds of ruler and minister, father and son remain unbroken, and the world and state return to order.

Yet the root of rectifying the mind and sincerity of intention, the subtlety of transmitting the Dao and imparting learning—without a teacher, none can bear the task of the Way. How perfect! The great master is the one whom scholars revere, and the title "great" crowns him, as if calling him "father of all fathers." First, he establishes the foundation by discussing knowing heaven, knowing man, and clarifying duty and fate. Nurturing what is known with the knowledge of what is unknown unites man with heaven. Knowing arises from not-knowing—this is the fullness of knowledge. Thus, he follows with the true man and true knowledge: sleeping without dreams, waking without care, going forth without delight, returning without resistance, emptiness without adornment, joy in forgetting words. Though seemingly without action, the instruments of governance—punishments, rites, knowledge, and virtue—are subtly embodied, guiding one to the ultimate of the inner sage and outer king.

If one would die for a beloved father or loyal ruler, how much more would one do so for one who is truly transcendent? The value of the true surpasses even the commands of ruler and father, yet the world remains ignorant, merely pursuing the trivial and fleeting, not realizing that forgetting each other in rivers and lakes is far better. The great clod bears our forms, allowing us to grow old in ease and die in rest—this is the goodness of creation toward our bodies. Yet most people prize life and fear death, so he sets forth the metaphors of hiding the boat in the ravine and the mountain in the valley to dispel their delusion. Where there is form and life, principle follows without fail. Though ravines and marshes are deep and firm, they are not exempt from change—thus, one sees that the creator is formless yet powerful.

To enshrine the boundless cosmos within a finite body—how could one ensure it does not drift away? Only by concealing the world within the world itself can one avoid loss, for this is the realm where the sage roams, the ground upon which all transformations depend. Birth of heaven, birth of earth, myriad changes without end—why should one rejoice merely in possessing a human form? To traverse ancient ages without aging, to ascend the clouded heavens and dwell in the dark palace—these are the wondrous workings of the perfected person, the foundation upon which the *Great Master* is built, the very lifeblood upon which people and creatures, disciples and followers, depend.

When Youyu exists beyond past and present, life and death cannot bind him. When Si and Lai befriend one another without discord, self and other cannot divide them. Thus, whether holding a rooster in the left hand or a zither in the right, whether riding the spirit-horse or the wheel of the buttocks, one listens to the transformations of creation and finds peace in whatever is encountered—this is what the ancients called "suspended liberation." How could the trifling limbs of insects or the liver’s span warrant the deluded doubts of smelters and foundries?

Zifan and Qinzhang sang and played strings to mourn Sanghu, seeing worldly engagement as toil and return to the true as fortune—this is wandering beyond the mundane, apart from世俗俗. When one joins with creation as a companion, then longevity and early death, poverty and success cannot exhaust its changes; heaven and earth, cold and heat cannot constrain its form.

Mengsun’s body was startled, yet his heart remained unharmed. Though he dreamed of becoming a fish or a bird, soaring through the heavens or plunging into the abyss, he found peace in the transformations of the moment—how could mere bodily form alter his essence? Long ago, Master Nanhua dreamed of becoming a butterfly, and it was the same. As for what is now called waking or dreaming, only one who transcends waking and dreaming knows.

Yanzi cast off his body and muted his senses, sitting in forgetfulness to reach the ultimate. Transmitting the mind’s hidden principles, he carried on the lineage of the sacred gate. The indigo deeper than the plant—this was truly the power of the master’s transformative teaching.

As for Zisang playing the zither, now singing, now weeping, one could not grasp the source of his actions, and so ultimately ascribed them to fate. Though he possessed the Way of the *Great Master*, he could not put it into practice in his time. Thus, this chapter concludes with Zisang’s acceptance of fate. The perfected person, having attained the Dao, transcends fate, and worldly burdens cannot bind him.

The *Great Master* is devoted to magnifying the Dao and awakening the people, yet fate may bring success or failure, movement or stillness—this depends on the times, though the Dao suffers no loss. What is called true knowledge thoroughly investigates heaven and humanity, fully realizing nature and destiny without doubt.

To exhaust principle and fulfill one’s nature to the point of destiny—this is in regard to ordering oneself. To command the transformations of things while preserving their origin—this is in regard to governing things. Ordering one’s own destiny—this is Zisang. Governing the destiny of things—this can only be the *Great Master*!

Master Chu Boxiu of Wulin’s *First Chapter on "Fit to Be King"*

Nie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times Wang Ni professed ignorance. Thereupon Nie Que leapt up in great joy and went to report this to Master Pu Yi.

Master Pu Yi said: “Have you only now come to know this? The Lord of Yu falls short of the Lord of Tai. The Lord of Yu harbored benevolence to entice people; though he gained their allegiance, he never emerged from the realm of the ‘non-human.’ The Lord of Tai moved with unhurried ease, awakened in tranquil openness—now taking himself for a horse, now for an ox. His knowledge was true to his nature, his virtue utterly genuine, and he never entered the realm of the ‘non-human.’”

Guo’s commentary: The Lords of Yu and Tai were both crossroads of worldly affairs, not the means to advance. What advances is the world—who names it? Thus, riding the transformations of leather, treading through ten thousand generations, the world may be level or perilous, yet traces may fall short. Those who take what they love as ‘human’ and what they hate as ‘non-human’ draw boundaries of right and wrong. To emerge from the realm of the ‘non-human’ is to enter a state where nothing is ‘non-human.’ Thus, there is no gain, no loss, no right, no wrong—how could this be merely harboring benevolence to entice people? Taking oneself for a horse or an ox—how could there be any ‘human’ or ‘non-human’ in this? Allowing self-knowledge, his nature was true; allowing self-attainment, there was no falsity. Not entering the realm of right and wrong—this is how he severed the age of the Lord of Yu.

Lü’s commentary: When Nie Que asked Wang Ni, “Do you know what things share as right?” and “Do you know what you do not know?”—then are things without knowledge? What is called ‘knowing’ is not ignorance, and what is called ‘not knowing’ is not knowledge. Wang Ni answered four times with “I do not know.” What things share as right extends only to what one does not know. Wang Ni’s ignorance was true ignorance, embodying it. Yu also means “anxious care,” and Tai means “tranquil stability.” To have knowledge and be anxious is not as good as to be without knowledge and be tranquilly stable. The Lord of Yu’s nearness harbored benevolence to entice people, and people followed him—thus he truly gained their allegiance. Yet by valuing benevolence as right, he inevitably deemed the absence of benevolence as wrong, never emerging from the ‘non-human.’ There was ‘human’ and ‘non-human,’ chaotic and confused. The Lord of Tai moved with unhurried ease, awakened in tranquil openness—taking himself for a horse or an ox, none found it objectionable. Thus, his knowledge was trustworthy and unquestioned, his attainment genuine and unfabricated. How could he know the absence of benevolence as wrong and enter the ‘non-human’? From Wang Ni’s perspective, it is clear that the Lord of Yu falls short of the Lord of Tai. ‘Falls short’ refers to advancement; the Lord of Tai is what the Lord of Yu advanced toward. To attain the traces of this advancement, one must release the mind and free the spirit, deeply entering what Wang Ni did not know.

Lin’s commentary: The Lord of Tai represents the pristine simplicity of high antiquity. By the time of Yao, simplicity had dispersed and laws were established. Shun further expanded upon Yao’s laws, which is why he fell short of the Lord of Tai. It is not that the Way of the sages differed, but that the changes of the times compelled the sages’ responses to differ as well. The Lord of Yu took benevolence as good and enticed the world—thus he gained the people’s allegiance, yet never emerged from the ‘non-human.’ If people possess benevolence, then they take the absence of benevolence as ‘non-human.’ From the perspective of the human Dao, the Lord of Yu indeed emerged from the ‘non-human’; from the perspective of the Heavenly Dao, even those who possess the ‘human’ are not free from the ‘non-human.’ *Xuxu* and *yuyu* both describe a relaxed, unhurried demeanor, depicting his simplicity. Sometimes taking himself for a horse, sometimes for an ox—he was at ease with it. Thus, his knowledge was true to his nature, and his virtue was utterly genuine. ‘Never entered the realm of the non-human’ means he was without right and wrong.

Xiang Dao’s commentary: The Dao takes not-knowing as its inner core and knowing as its outer form; not-knowing is profound, knowing is shallow. Thus, when Nie Que asked four times, Wang Ni answered each time with “I do not know,” and Nie Que awakened, rejoicing as he reported this to Master Pu Yi. Master Pu Yi then spoke of the traces of non-action. The Scripture says: “The Lord of Yu summoned benevolence and righteousness to disturb the people of the world,” and “The Lord of Yu’s medicine was a sore; Shun had a foul stench.” Both harbored benevolence to entice people toward the Dao, yet their simplicity was already lost—thus they never emerged from the ‘non-human.’ The Lord of Tai, however, forgot both self and others, free from entanglements. If you called him an ox, he answered to ox; if you called him a horse, he answered to horse. What he knew was true to his nature, what he attained was utterly genuine, and his Dao was simple and undiluted. Thus, it is said: “He never entered the realm of the ‘non-human.’” When Qin Shi said to Lao Dan, “I took you for a human, but now you are not,” the meaning of ‘non-human’ is like this.

Bi Xu’s commentary: When the sage practices the teaching without words, the four questions and four instances of not-knowing form the guiding thread of *Fit to Be King*. The Lord of Yu is an analogy for having knowledge; the Lord of Tai, for having no knowledge. Harboring people to entice people involves good and evil. ‘Never emerged from the non-human’ means following the same current as the vulgar. Taking oneself for a horse or an ox means forgetting both things and self. Knowing one’s nature without falsity—thus it is said his nature was true. What he practiced was not lost—thus it is said his virtue was genuine. ‘Never entered the realm of the non-human’ means transcending beyond the dust of the world.

Zhao’s commentary: The Master said: “Do I possess knowledge? I possess no knowledge.” This means that only when one reaches the state of no-knowledge is it true knowledge. Nie Que leapt up in awakening and reported this to Master Pu Yi. Master Pu Yi said: “Why have you come to know this so late? The Lord of Yu took benevolence as good, seeking to win the people’s hearts—this human accord never departed from Heaven.”

The Lord of Tai achieved self-possession in waking and sleeping alike. To take oneself for a horse was acceptable; to take oneself for an ox was also acceptable. Joy and anger did not arise, and both things and self were forgotten—this was the Way of the true person. His knowledge was genuine, matching the turning of the seasons without error. His virtue was utterly real, without the slightest falsity—this accord with Heaven never departed from the human. The Lord of Yu compared to the Lord of Tai was like Yao compared to Xu You.

Yongzhai observed: Four questions met with four silences—this was the meaning of the *Vimalakīrti Sūtra*’s "non-dual Dharma-gate of non-speech." Nie Que, awakened to this wordless teaching, rejoiced and reported it to Pu Yi. Pu Yi said: "Have you only now come to realize this? The Lord of Tai, an ancient sage-king, embraced benevolence to bind the people’s hearts—this too could win the people, yet it did not go beyond being like Heaven. It meant he merely followed Heaven as his companion, for the non-human was none other than Heaven. Thus it is said he ‘never departed from the non-human.’ ‘Never departed’ means nothing more than this. Not calling it Heaven but the ‘non-human’—this is his extraordinary phrasing. Taking oneself for a horse or an ox—he left such matters unquestioned, letting others call him what they would. What he knew was all real principle; his virtue was inherent, all celestial truth. At this stage, even ‘Heaven’ was insufficient to name it. Left to its own natural course, it transcended even creation. Thus it is said he ‘never entered the realm of the non-human.’ First he speaks of ‘departing,’ then of ‘entering’—observe his choice of words.

Nie Que’s questions to Wang Ni are the same four questions from the *Equalizing Things* chapter. This text cites them again at the outset to clarify that true knowledge is no-knowledge, and thus one knows all things. The Way of the sage-king, above all, should forget knowledge and let things follow their course—letting the keen-eared listen, the clear-sighted see, the wise plan, and the brave defend, while I sit upright in tranquil non-action to achieve governance without effort. Is this not magnificent? Thus Nie Que, moved by Wang Ni’s responses, rejoiced and told Pu Yi. Pu Yi said: "Only now do you understand that the Lord of Yu fell short of the Lord of Tai? For he took benevolence as good and could not help but display it. ‘Never departed from the non-human’—his virtue merely accorded with the human. The Lord of Tai, self-possessed in waking and sleeping, with knowledge and virtue both genuine, ‘never entered the realm of the non-human’—his Way accorded with Heaven, so where was there any departure or entry? His Way accorded with Heaven, and the people turned to him. This is the foremost principle of *Responding as Emperor and King*."

The character *zang* was formerly written as *cang* (藏); thus Cui’s commentary reads: "Embracing benevolence and righteousness to bind the people." Cheng’s subcommentary followed this. Lü’s edition used *zang* (臧), glossing it as "good." Later scholars such as Lin and Chen all adopted Lü’s interpretation. Some argue that *zang* and *cang* are interchangeable, but as the *Han History: Treatise on Food and Goods* states: "Light and small, easy to *zang*," this shows *zang* was borrowed for *cang*, not the reverse. Most modern editions use *zang*, and interpreting it as "good" is appropriate.

Jian Wu met the madman Jie Yu. Jie Yu asked: "What did Ri Zhongshi tell you?"

Jian Wu said: "He told me that one who rules others issues laws, standards, principles, and measures from himself—who would dare not obey and be transformed?"

Jie Yu the Madman replied: "This is deceitful *power*. In governing the world, it is like crossing the sea by digging a river or commanding a mosquito to bear a mountain. Does the sage’s governance extend beyond this? First rectify, then act—this is simply ensuring one’s capacity for the task. Moreover, the cormorant flies high to evade the harm of nets and arrows, the mole digs deep beneath the sacred mound to avoid the calamity of pitfalls—yet you deem these two creatures ignorant!

Guo’s commentary: If one entrusts all to the myriad things, affairs resolve themselves without effort; but if one seeks to govern the world through a single person, no achievement is possible, and the burden is insurmountable. Thus, the sage’s governance consists in preserving what lies within his proper sphere, rectifying each being’s nature and destiny, and refraining from what he cannot do. Even birds and beasts each have their means of self-preservation—this is why emperors and kings rely on them without interference, allowing the myriad things to perfect themselves. Have you not yet learned from these two creatures, who preserve themselves without need of instruction?"

Lü’s commentary: One who rules others makes his voice the law and his person the measure, yet employs others solely at his own discretion—this is what is meant by ‘issuing laws from oneself.’ When affairs are governed by principle, and others must gauge his intentions, this is what is meant by ‘applying standards, principles, and measures to others.’ Such are merely the uses of manifest influence, not the transformation of things through command. Thus, what is called ‘law’ may not be law, what is called ‘principle’ may not be principle—it is nothing but deceitful *power*. It is like crossing the sea by digging a river, which cannot succeed, or commanding a mosquito to bear a mountain, which cannot be borne. The weightiest of things, the sacred vessel that cannot be forced—if one issues laws, standards, principles, and measures to others from himself, this is merely external governance. First rectify, then act, ensuring one’s capacity for the task—this is not what is meant by external governance. If it were so, there would be no partiality or bias, and people would not perceive his inclinations; no duplicity or deceit, and people would not discern his aversions; no likes or dislikes, and people could neither approach nor avoid him."

What I do all emerges from the realm of profound sameness—thus the true and false of the world are revealed, and who would dare wield cunning devices to plumb the depths of my ninefold abyss for its pearl?

Now, the crow soars high and the rat burrows deep to seek refuge—could one call these two creatures devoid of knowledge? Yet if man, surpassing these creatures in understanding, cannot rid himself of self and allow others no means to pry, then he is not their equal.

Master Lin notes: To govern the world by imposing one’s own laws and standards is ultimately no more successful than crossing the sea by digging a river or commanding a mosquito to bear a mountain—it is to undertake what one cannot bear.

In ancient times, the sages governed the world by allowing the people to dwell in peace and all things to follow their nature—why then would they toil over laws and standards to govern externally? The sages, in accordance with the nature of people and things, ensured competence in affairs and entrusted them accordingly, confining themselves to their proper roles.

The crow soars high and the rat burrows deep to avoid harm—this they do without instruction. The people possess their constant nature; let them fulfill their allotted roles, and why impose laws, standards, principles, and measures to disrupt their inherent nature?

The *Daode* commentary states: At midday, one does not govern the multitude with obscurity; at the outset, one does not respond to things with arbitrary power. Not governing the multitude with obscurity is to impose laws from oneself; not responding to things with arbitrary power is to impose standards and measures upon others. Thus, it is like crossing the sea by digging a river without following its principles, or commanding a mosquito to bear a mountain without measuring its capacity. Not following its principles is not what is meant by "first rectifying, then acting"; not measuring its capacity is not what is meant by "ensuring one’s competence for the task."

Even the crow and the rat know to soar high and burrow deep to avoid harm—how then could the sage’s governance rely on imposing laws from oneself to seek respite?

Master Bixu notes: When the expansive Way of managing the world and the transformative power of principle are employed, which of the common people would dare not listen and be transformed? Those who do not cultivate themselves but instead adorn others engage in deceitful *power*.

To "govern externally" is to say one must first govern internally; if one does not first rectify and then act, one cannot lead the multitude. Even the lowly creatures of bird and rat shun harm to preserve their lives—how much more should man do so?

To impose laws, standards, and measures is the instrument of governing the age, not the means by which one who rules possesses virtue. Master Zhao notes: The sun at its zenith first informed Jianwu that the sage’s governance of the world, establishing laws and setting forth regulations as models for all ages, would ensure the world’s submission. Jieyu said the sea is boundless—attempting to cross it by digging a river, or commanding the tiniest of insects to bear a mountain—is like relying on mere laws, standards, and measures to order the world and guide it toward transformation, which is entirely without principle.

"I favor stillness, and the people naturally become upright; I practice non-action, and the people naturally transform"—the sage exhausts what lies within himself. How could he make external governance his duty? Even the crow and the rat know to avoid danger and seek safety without instruction—could man be inferior to these two creatures?

Master Yongzhai says: Laws, standards, and principles all emerge from oneself, using one’s person to transform the world. To "measure others" is to transform the people. The structure of "laws, standards, and principles" is akin to "harmony and ease." "Deceitful *power*" means self-deception, not true virtue. To "govern externally" is to transform through one’s person, leaving traces. "First rectify, then act" is to follow the principles of nature and destiny. "Ensuring competence for the task" is to fulfill this natural course.

The crow and the rat in their evasion and rest—this speaks of how those bound by limits are burdened by trammels, yet even they are not inferior to these two creatures in their innate knowledge. The one who "acts at midday" is he who strives for clarity and delights in taking the lead; thus, I tell Jianwu of the way to rule as a sovereign: if one issues laws, standards, and principles from oneself, then governs others by these measures, they disrupt the natural dispositions of life and destiny—who among the people would dare not obey and be transformed? Yet such compliance is but outward submission, not heartfelt sincerity.

Thus, Jieyu points to this as "deceitful *power*," meaning it is not true virtue; it not only deceives others but also deceives oneself. To govern the world by such means is to rely on emptiness and achieve nothing—it is surely beyond one’s capacity. How could the sage’s governance be concerned with externals? Laws, standards, and principles are all tools for governing what lies outside. "First rectify, then act"—this is to firmly grasp one’s task, to speak of the principles of virtue, nature, and destiny, which are the inner duties of one’s person. Rooted within, they may then be extended to ordering the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world. Moreover, even birds and rats know to fly high or burrow deep to avoid harm—how much more should one who aspires to rule others not practice deceitful *power* and invite calamity, for they would be inferior even to these two creatures.

Thus, the ancients who responded to the call of emperors and kings did so without desire or action, and the world transformed itself. If one relies on cunning and ability to govern, the ruler toils above while the people descend into chaos below—how can order be expected? If one issues laws, standards, and principles from oneself, who among the people would dare not obey and be transformed?

Most commentaries parse the phrase as "following the classics and the people," but Lin and Zhao parse it as "following the measure." The *Bixu* edition, collated by Zhang Junfang, reads: "Issuing laws, standards, and principles from oneself, how could the common people dare not obey and be transformed?" Further examination of the *Wu Men Guan* edition reveals a unique variant: "issuing regulations from oneself," with "regulate" as the distinct character. After weighing the various interpretations, Lin and Zhao’s parsing is superior, and I follow it here.

Tian Gen wandered to Yin Yang, arriving at the banks of the Liao River, where he encountered the Nameless Man and asked him, "May I inquire about governing the world?" The Nameless Man replied, "Begone! You are a vulgar man—why do you ask such an inopportune question? I am about to join the Creator in shaping humanity. When weary, I ride the boundless bird, soaring beyond the six directions to wander in the land of Nothingness, dwelling in the vast wilderness. Why do you trouble me with governing the world and disturb my heart?"

He asked again. The Nameless Man said, "Let your heart wander in simplicity, unite your *qi* with the void, follow things as they are without imposing private intentions—and the world will be governed."

Guo’s commentary: To ask about governing the world is not to transcend the Great Beginning or abide in the Mysterious Darkness. To "join the Creator in shaping humanity" is to let people act of their own accord. "Boundless" describes the tattered and fragmented. Riding the tattered, one gallops through the ten thousand things, thus able to move freely and dwell in the realm of spontaneous attainment, governing without governing. Following one’s nature is simplicity; stillness within one’s nature is the void. Letting nature generate itself is impartiality; seeking to augment it with the heart’s desires is partiality. Partiality is indeed insufficient to generate, while following impartiality preserves wholeness.

Lü’s commentary: The Nameless Man embodies the Dao; one who embodies the Dao has nothing to accept or reject. Here, it speaks of acceptance and rejection as if in common with others. Acceptance is joining the Creator in shaping humanity; rejection is riding the boundless bird beyond the six directions. Why? For such a one, existence and nonexistence lie within oneself, and entry and exit know no bounds—who would willingly take governing the world as their concern? Why do you trouble me with governing the world and disturb my heart? To "let your heart wander in simplicity" and "unite your *qi* with the void" without imposing private intentions—this is the way to effortlessly take hold of the world.

Lin’s commentary: Tian Gen is the root of nature. "Nameless" refers to the sage’s unpredictability, meaning he does not reveal himself beforehand but only responds when questioned. "Joining the Creator in shaping humanity"—when weary, he rides the obscure and soaring beyond the six directions, illustrating that the sage’s Dao is present everywhere yet truly without action. This is sufficient to respond to emperors and kings. "Why do you trouble me with governing the world and disturb my heart?"—this means it is insufficient to move me. Tian Gen asked again. The answer was to let the heart wander in simplicity, which purifies the spirit, and to unite *qi* with the void, which nurtures *qi*. Thus, things come without resistance, great harmony prevails without partiality, and without striving for governance, the world is governed.

Xiang Dao’s commentary: Tian Gen speaks of the root; the Nameless Man speaks of the sage. Tian Gen arises from the root to address the branches, emerging from obscurity to seek clarity, and asks about governing the world—the Nameless Man thus disdains him. To "join the Creator in shaping humanity" already involves action. Thus, when weary, he rides the boundless, soars beyond the six directions, wanders in Nothingness, and dwells in the vast wilderness. "Boundless" is a metaphor for the heart’s wandering—this is to "let the heart wander in simplicity, unite *qi* with the void, and follow things without partiality." If so, the world governs itself without governance—why impose methods of rule?

Bi Xu’s commentary: "Joining the Creator in shaping humanity" is to willfully create. Riding the boundless, soaring beyond the six directions—this is to tread the subtle and mysterious, transcending yin and yang. Wandering in Nothingness, dwelling in the vast wilderness—this is the realm of the Dao, the domain of emptiness. Following things as they are without imposing private intentions—partiality loses the natural.

Zhao’s commentary: Tian Gen is a title for the sovereign. "Nameless" is the designation of the true person. Yin Yang is a place of flourishing brightness. The Liao River is a land of desolation. The Creator covers and supports heaven and earth, sculpting the myriad forms—yet it is fundamentally without intention. I am already weary of it and transcend beyond form and *qi*—why trouble me with governing the world and disturb my heart? The Nameless Man asked again. He answered with the principle of following things as they are—any intention to act is partiality.

The error in Tian Gen’s question lies in the word "act"—with non-action, the world governs itself.

Yongzhai notes: To be a person with the Creator is to dwell in the world while following the natural. Roaming within the world is sufficient; one may then wander beyond the Creator’s domain. Mangmiao is the *qi* of emptiness and nothingness. "What exists" and "vast wilderness" are the great void, boundless and infinite. Why trouble my heart with governing the world?

The character *bo* in the silk manuscript, in Cui’s version, is written as *wei*, both conveying the sense of "why." Vague and formless, *qi* is akin to *xing*—with this heart and this *xing* both aligning with the natural. Earlier, it was said: "Do not listen with the heart but listen with *qi*." Thus, *qi* here should be interpreted as *xing*. Following the Creator without imposing private intention, the world governs itself—why act for the world?

The Nameless Man is akin to "Master Vacuous" or "Sir Non-Existent." Tian Gen symbolizes the root of the natural, which should remain hidden, nurturing and allowing things to transform on their own. Yet now, drawn toward the realm of flourishing brightness, he reveals himself in pursuit of action—hence his question about governing the world. The Nameless One, whom the sage disdains, asks in a way that displeases my heart. He then declares the joy of non-action and unfettered wandering, using it to enlighten him.

"To be a person with the Creator" means to move in harmony with transformation, following without aiding. Mangmiao, like *yaoming*, is a metaphor for flight without trace. Kuanglang describes a vast, open expanse. He says: "I roam freely and at ease—how could you, with governance of the world, disturb my heart?"

Tian Gen asked again. The Nameless Man instructed him to let his heart wander in blandness, free from desires, and to harmonize his *qi* with the formless, untroubled void. Following things as they are without imposing private intention—any intention to act for the world introduces partiality and loses the natural. This is called "governing," yet it is the very source of chaos.

The way to govern the world is nothing other than skillfully returning to the root of the natural. When the self is cultivated, the world is governed. Tian Gen, unaware of turning inward to seek within himself, clings to his treasure and loses his way—how lamentable!

**Chapter Two: Responding as Emperor and King**

Yang Ziju saw Lao Dan and said: "Suppose there is a man here—swift in action, strong and resolute, penetrating in understanding, clear in discernment, and tireless in studying the Dao. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?"

Lao Dan replied: "In the eyes of a sage, he is but a petty functionary bound by skill, one who wearies the body and startles the mind. Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards bring hunters, the agility of apes and monkeys invites snares, and the cunning of dogs draws leashes—could such be compared to an enlightened king?"

Yang Ziju, startled, said: "I venture to ask: how does an enlightened king govern?"

Lao Dan said: "The governance of an enlightened king—his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own; he transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. No name is raised, and things rejoice of themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and roams in the realm of nothingness."

**Guo’s Commentary:**
"Bound by skill and startling the mind—such efforts leave no room for the self and are unworthy of comparison to a sage-king. For one whose body is entangled by patterns and abilities does not traverse the empty to cultivate the boundless. Without an enlightened king, none in the world can attain self-realization; yet his work lies in non-action, returning the burden to the world, so that all may carry their own tasks. Thus, though his achievements cover the world, he does not claim them as his own; though things are transformed, he does not rely on them as his power. Things all believe they have attained their own joy, and though he dwells in the path of ceaseless change, he remains without fixed form. Identifying with the ten thousand things, he roams in emptiness. If one cannot merge with things, how can one roam in the void?"

**Lü’s Commentary:**
"Swift in action" means hastening to affairs. "Strong and resolute" means not overcoming with softness. "Penetrating in understanding" means not attaining true non-knowledge. "Clear in discernment" means clarity that does not arise from itself. "Tireless in studying the Dao" means not yet having reduced the self to embody the Dao. Having skills wearies the body and thoughts; being bound disturbs the mind—like artisans exchanging short and long, having and lacking, such is not how a sage employs the world. Tigers, leopards, apes, and dogs are hunted or leashed because they invite it—thus, those who weary the body and disturb the mind to be used by the world have brought it upon themselves through strength and clarity. "Leashed" means being employed by others through skill and force. If one does not claim power and does not rely on transformation, then those who possess abilities cannot raise a name for him, and things merely rejoice of themselves. The reason for this is that he stands in the unfathomable and roams in nothingness. Thus, the earlier comparison to an enlightened king was indeed misguided."

**Lin’s Commentary:**
"Enlightened" is the dispersion of spirit; "king" is the movement of the sage. "Responding as Emperor and King" means emerging to govern the world. Thus, when asked whether swiftness and clarity could be compared to an enlightened king, the answer is: if such could be so compared, then all petty functionaries bound by skill, wearying the body and disturbing the mind, could aspire to sagehood. Could tigers and leopards, hunted for their patterns, or apes and dogs, leashed for their agility, be compared to an enlightened king? Yang Ziju, astonished, inquired about the governance of an enlightened king. The reply was: his achievements cover the world yet are not claimed as his own; he transforms the ten thousand things yet does not rely on them. This means that the enlightened kings of old had no designs on the world, yet the world turned to them, extending their spirit to embody the virtue of heaven and earth, and moving their minds to respond to the changes of things—all beginning from this. Thus, though he has achievements, he does not raise them as his name; though he transforms things, he does not rejoice in it himself. Therefore, the world ascribes merit to him, and things rejoice of themselves. Standing above the unfathomable, yin and yang cannot restrain him; roaming in the realm of nothingness, the ten thousand things cannot burden him."

**Xiang Dao’s Commentary:**
"Swift in action and strong and resolute" differ from the infant’s simplicity. "Penetrating in understanding and clear in discernment" differ from one who is enlightened yet appears dim. "Tireless in studying the Dao" differs from one who abandons learning and is without care. The enlightened king is the sage, and the sage transforms the world through non-action. Now, to be diligent in these three and entangled with things is like exchanging skills for profit—how could this not weary the body and disturb the mind, inviting exhaustion? The governance of an enlightened king does not claim achievements, so what effort does he exert upon the people? Transforming things without reliance, what do the people gain from him? Thus, his name is not raised, his traces are not manifest, his substance is not amassed, and no exhaustion reaches him. He makes emptiness the root of all fullness and supplies the ten thousand things’ needs with nothingness."

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:**
"Swift in action" means rushing toward affairs. "Strong and resolute" means intolerance of adversity. "Penetrating in understanding" and "clear in discernment" mean prizing cleverness. To presume knowledge of this and neglect natural spontaneity is to bind oneself with skills, weary the body, and disturb the mind. Tigers, leopards, apes, and monkeys are metaphors for how abilities invite harm—like achievements that seem not one’s own. Forgetting the self, the people do not rely on him; forgetting achievements, no name is raised; forgetting the name, he roams in nothingness; forgetting all, such is the governance of an enlightened king."

**Zhao’s Commentary:**
"Swift in action" means swift in purpose. "Strong and resolute" means firm and decisive. "Penetrating in understanding" and "forceful in action" mean such a one could be compared to an enlightened king. The answer is: the Dao values softness, obscurity, and non-action—such a one opposes the Dao and is burdened by talent. How could this not weary the body and disturb the mind, bringing harm? Like tigers, leopards, apes, and dogs hunted or leashed, all invite disaster through their abilities and are unfit to govern the world. Yang Ziju further inquired, still attached to action. Laozi, abiding in non-action, replied: achievements are completed yet seem not to arise from oneself; things are transformed yet one does not rely on them as ability. Things each find their own harmony, and none can name his merit—just as Confucius praised Yao, saying the people could not name his achievements, yet they were majestic."

Yongzhai remarked: The earlier criticism of "forceful vigor" and the like, though not naming names, was a veiled reproach of Confucius. *Xu* refers to convict laborers; *yi* means "to alternate," akin to conscripted service. The phrase *yao* has ancient precedent, much like the Han term "ghost-firewood gatherers." Those bound by *shou* were artisans ensnared by their own intricate skills. Such a path of learning wearies both body and mind—just as tigers and leopards, with their patterned hides, invite hunting, or apes and dogs, through their agility and cunning, bring themselves to be leashed. This is severe censure indeed.

Ziju pressed further with his questions. Laozi at last revealed: "When merit blankets the world yet seems not to arise from oneself, so that things rejoice of their own accord—this is the meaning of 'achievement without possession,' the sense of 'what power does the emperor add?' To stand in the unfathomable is to wander in the realm of nothingness, where the brush dances of its own accord."

The foregoing passages all misconstrue the intent of the original chapter. The term *xiangji* has been variously interpreted; the *Pronunciation and Meaning* cites Emperor Jianwen of Liang, who took *xiang* as "echo," akin to the "resonant" in the passage on Cook Ding—reading it as "echo." Yet weighing the chapter’s overarching meaning, Lü, Lin, and Bixu’s literal interpretation of the character is superior. Here, I propose: *xiangji* denotes swiftness in responding to things; *qiangliang* describes one who does not abide in softness; *wuche* means delighting in thoroughfare with things; *shuming* refers to one who does not preserve obscurity. The study of the Dao prizes non-action, yet to take tireless effort as merit is like bartering and binding oneself through skill—inevitably wearying body and mind. What is sought is not the true Way.

Moreover, the question "Could this be compared to an enlightened king?" is Lao Dan’s rhetorical counter: If one deems the earlier traits—swift response, forceful vigor, and the like—worthy of comparison to an enlightened king, then are tigers and leopards, hunted for their patterned hides, or apes and dogs, leashed for their agility and prowess, also fit to be compared to enlightened kings? Only then did Ziju awaken. Abashed, he inquired about the governance of an enlightened king. Laozi replied: to forget merit, to bestow virtue freely, to flee from fame, to vanish from form—only then can one speak of enlightened governance. For what Ziju discussed was outward conduct, while what Lao Dan expounded was the heart. The division between heart and conduct has long been thus.

The phrase *zhi mao* is untenable; *mao* has two pronunciations, *li* and *lai*, but how could a dog seize an ox of such great size? The *Pronunciation and Meaning* records that Li’s edition reads *li* ("raccoon dog"), which is apt.

In Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who could foretell a person’s life or death, fortune or misfortune, longevity or early demise—down to the year, month, or day—with godlike precision. When the people of Zheng saw him, they fled in haste. Liezi, however, was entranced upon meeting him. Returning home, he told Huzhi: "At first, I took your Way as supreme, but now I see there is something even greater." Huzhi replied: "I have shown you only its outward form, not its true substance. How could you have attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? By flaunting your Way before the world and insisting on its truth, you have made it possible for others to read your fortune. Bring him to me tomorrow, and let him see me."

The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to meet Huzhi. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: "Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. He will not last ten days!"

I saw something uncanny—like damp ashes.
Liezi entered, tears soaking his lapels as he told Huzhi.
Huzhi said: "I showed him the earthly pattern, sprouting yet neither stirring nor upright. He must have seen my sealed virtue-mechanism. Bring him again tomorrow."

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzhi again. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: "How fortunate your master is to have met me! He has hope now—he is fully alive! I saw his sealed power unfold."
Liezi entered and told Huzhi.
Huzhi said: "I showed him the boundless expanse of heaven and earth, where names and realities do not intrude, and the mechanism springs from the heels. He must have seen my virtuous mechanism at its finest. Bring him again tomorrow."

The next day, they came to see Huzhi once more. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: "Your master’s bearing is flawed. Though he penetrates things and clarifies affairs, he still relies on keen perception. With this, he vainly presumes to know one thing by another, binding his skill to external connections, wearing out his body and exhausting his mind."

The tiger, leopard, ape, and monkey are hunted and trapped for their abilities—such gifts do not originate from themselves.

Forget the self, and the people will not depend on you;
Forget merit, and no name can be ascribed;
Forget the name, and you wander in the realm of nothingness;
Forget all, and the governance of an enlightened king is thus.

Zhao’s commentary: "Swiftness of purpose" refers to those whose aspirations are quick and keen. "Strength and boldness" describes those who are resolute and daring. When things arise, they discern clearly and act with unyielding force—can such be compared to an enlightened king? The answer lies in the Dao’s esteem for softness, obscurity, and non-action. Those who act thus oppose the Dao and are burdened by their own talents. Not only do they weary the body and exhaust the mind, but they also invite harm! Like the tiger, leopard, ape, and monkey, lured into the hunt or ensnared by their own prowess, their abilities bring disaster—such men are unfit to govern the world.

Ziju pressed further, expounding on active governance. Laozi, abiding in non-action, replied: When merit encompasses all under heaven, it seems not to issue from oneself; things transform, yet one does not rely on this as ability. Each thing finds its own harmony, and none can name one’s merit—just as Confucius praised Yao, saying the people could not name his achievements, yet they towered in their majesty.

Yongzhai observed: The phrases "swiftness of purpose" and "strength and boldness," though not directed by name, are a veiled rebuke of Confucius. *Xu* refers to convict laborers; *yi* means "to change," akin to "conscripted service." The phrase *yao gu you ci yu* echoes an ancient saying, much like the Han term "ghostly firewood gatherers." Those bound by *shou* are artisans and craftsmen, ensnared by their own skill and technique. To pursue learning in this way is to labor both body and mind—like the tiger and leopard, whose patterns draw hunters, or the ape and monkey, whose agility invites snares. This is the harshest of critiques.

Ziju asked again. The reply concluded: When merit blankets the world yet seems not to originate from oneself, so that things rejoice of their own accord—this is the meaning of "merit achieved yet unpossessed," and "what power does the emperor add?" To stand in the unfathomable is to wander in nothingness, as if dancing at the tip of a brush. The foregoing passages all obscure the intent of the "Decree" chapter.

The term *xiang ji* has elicited varied interpretations. The *Pronunciation and Meaning* cites Emperor Jianwen of Liang, who equates *xiang* with *xiang* ("echo"), as in the passage where Cook Ding’s knife *xiang ran* ("resonates")—thus reading it as "echo." Yet upon examining the chapter’s intent, Lü, Lin, and Bixu’s literal interpretation of the character proves superior.

Here is my proposed reading: *xiang ji* denotes swift responsiveness to things; *qiang liang* ("unyielding force") refers to one who fails to embrace softness. *Wu che* ("penetrating things") means delighting in communion with them; *shu ming* ("unobstructed clarity") describes one who does not conceal their radiance. The study of the Dao values non-action, yet to prize tirelessness as merit is akin to bartering and binding oneself through skill—inevitably wearying body and mind. What is sought is not the true Way.

Moreover, can such qualities as *xiang ji* and *qiang liang* truly be compared to the enlightened ruler? This is Lao Dan’s rhetorical question: if the foregoing discussion of swiftness and force were to liken one to a sage-king, then would the tiger and leopard, hunted for their patterns, or the ape and dog, ensnared for their agility and tenacity, also suffice as metaphors for enlightened rule?

Ziju then awoke to the truth and inquired about the governance of the enlightened ruler. He was told that only by forgetting merit, bestowing virtue freely, fleeing fame, and concealing one’s form could one begin to discuss such governance. For Ziju’s discourse concerned outward conduct, while Lao Dan’s addressed the inner heart. The division between heart and trace has endured for ages.

As for *zhi mao* ("grasping the yak"), the interpretation falters—*mao* has two pronunciations, *li* and *lai*, yet how could a dog seize a great ox? The *Pronunciation and Meaning* records Li’s emendation to *li* ("raccoon-dog") as correct.

In Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who could discern a person’s life and death, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise, predicting them by year, month, or day with uncanny accuracy. The people of Zheng, upon seeing him, would flee in haste. When Liezi encountered him, he was entranced and returned to tell Master Hu, saying: "At first, I believed your Way to be supreme, yet now I see there is something even greater."

Huzi replied: "I have taught you only its outward form, not its essence—how could you have truly attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster will never lay fertile eggs. Yet you parade the Way before the world and insist on its truth, so naturally others can read your fortune. Bring him to me tomorrow, and let him examine me."

The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huzi. Upon leaving, the diviner said to Liezi: "Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. Not even ten days remain!"

I saw something strange—he saw only damp ashes."

Liezi entered, his tears soaking his lapels as he told Huzi. Huzi said: "Just now I showed him the earthly pattern, sprouting yet neither stirring nor upright. He likely saw only my sealed virtue-mechanism. Bring him again tomorrow."

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzi once more. Upon leaving, the diviner said to Liezi: "Fortunate indeed that your master has met me! He was fading, but now he is fully alive—I saw his sealed power!"

Liezi entered and told Huzi. Huzi said: "Just now I showed him heaven and earth, where names and realities do not enter, and the mechanism arises from the heels. He likely saw my virtuous mechanism. Bring him again tomorrow."

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzi once more. Upon leaving, the diviner said to Liezi: "Your master is unsettled—I cannot read him. Let him settle, and I will examine him again."

Liezi entered and told Huzi. Huzi said: "Just now I confined my display to the Great Thoroughfare, where nothing prevails. He likely saw my balanced qi-mechanism. The stillness of a deep pool, the stillness of still water, the stillness of flowing water—each is called a deep pool. There are nine names for the deep, and here he has witnessed three. Bring him again tomorrow."

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzi once more. Before he could stand firmly, the diviner lost himself and fled. Huzi said: "Pursue him!" Liezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Huzi: "He has vanished, disappeared—I could not reach him."

Huzi said: "Just now I showed him what had never yet emerged from my source. I met him with emptiness and compliance, leaving him unsure who or what I was. Thus he took me for drifting reeds, for flowing waves, and so he fled."

Thereafter, Liezi considered himself as one who had never yet begun to learn and returned home, not venturing out for three years. He cooked for his wife, fed pigs as he would feed people, and in all matters remained unattached. He carved and polished only to return to simplicity, standing alone like an unhewn clod. Amidst the tangled world, he remained thus to the end.

For Jiyian divined others by reading their hearts with his own, yet when I am without heart, what he relies upon to divine cannot stand alone—thus he lost himself and fled, never to be found again. Emptied and yielding, unknown as any particular thing, one is without heart and without action. When still, he takes it for drifting reeds—yet none know it as reeds. When moving, he takes it for flowing waves—yet none know it as waves. Seeking me in motion or stillness, he finds nothing—this is why he flees.

Feeding pigs as one feeds people is the utmost forgetting of self. Unattached to affairs, one reaches the extreme of emptiness. Carving and polishing only to return to simplicity, standing alone like an unhewn clod—amidst the world’s entanglements, one guards one’s domain to the end, unchanged by all the clamor of the ten thousand things.

Lin’s commentary: When Liezi saw Jiyian, he doubted whether his master’s Dao fell short. Huzi explained that substance is revealed through form, and the Dao is made manifest in affairs. He said, “You and I have exhausted form but not yet substance—how could we attain the Dao? It is like a flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? Since you have not yet grasped the substance of my Dao, your Dao still contends with the world and must be validated by others, so Jiyian could divine you. ‘Damp ashes’ signify the signs of impending death. I showed him ‘earthly patterns’—had I not shown them, there would be no pattern at all. Without trembling, there is only stillness and motionlessness—this is integrity, the integrity of the One. Thus the body remains at peace. Without integrity, there is no One—this is what makes ‘earthly patterns.’

Though virtue holds its mechanism, it remains sealed and untriggered—something he cannot comprehend. ‘Heaven and earth’ signify the work of covering and supporting, which extends to things, just as the mechanism of the Dao emerges from its root, yet name and reality have not yet entered. The ‘heel’ is the lowest part of the form. ‘Utmost goodness’ is called ‘that which can be desired.’ What he perceives is the ‘mechanism.’ Huzi called himself ‘authority’—authority perceives only the coarse, while the mechanism resides in the subtle.

First, I sealed the mechanism within utmost stillness, and the diviner suspected death. Next, I released the mechanism from the lowest depths, and he suspected life. Then, neither moving nor still, neither dead nor alive, uneven and unaligned—there was nothing by which to divine. ‘Supreme harmony’ is utmost emptiness at the center. ‘None prevails’ is what *Liezi* calls ‘no trace.’ ‘Balance’ is perfect equilibrium—responding to things, it becomes uneven and unaligned. Qi, though empty and awaiting things, has not yet departed from the mechanism.

Huzi concealed his spirit in the interval of utmost emptiness and no trace, where the unevenness of movement and stillness, yin and yang, is like the balance responding to things—thus Jiyian could not divine him. *You* is a great fish. ‘Abiding’ means lingering. Still water forms a deep pool—this illustrates ‘earthly patterns.’ Flowing water forms a deep pool—this illustrates ‘heaven and earth.’ The great fish coils within the deep, now clear, now swift, uneven and unaligned—this illustrates ‘supreme harmony with no trace.’

*Liezi* speaks of nine deep pools; here, three are cited to clarify Huzi’s affair. Supreme harmony has not yet departed from the mechanism of qi, but when it has never yet emerged from my source, it becomes one with Heaven—this is why Jiyian lost himself and fled. Without heart and following things, one is empty and yielding, unknown as any particular person or thing.

‘Yielding’ means following. ‘Reeds’ means compliance. If he takes it for yielding reeds, I take it as yielding reeds. If he takes it for flowing waves, I take it as flowing waves—this speaks of Huzi’s transformations within himself. Seeing Huzi’s Dao, Liezi awakened and realized he had never yet begun to learn. Returning home, he cooked for his wife and fed pigs as he would feed people, unaware of distinctions between noble and base, self and other. Unburdened by tasks, he shed ornament to return to simplicity, standing alone like an unhewn clod. Though affairs were tangled, he guarded his domain to the end, unchanged by them.

Detailed commentary on the Dao: Roaming with the Dao, one is without heart, so the mechanisms of life and death, fortune and misfortune vanish within—nothing can be divined. Mingling with the world, one is encumbered, so the omens of life and death, fortune and misfortune appear without—thus they can be divined. This is why Jiyian’s divination succeeded with others but failed with Huzi.

‘Earthly patterns’ are the congealed form of yin softness. ‘Heaven and earth’ reveal the work of covering and nurturing. ‘Supreme harmony’ is the central qi of Heaven and Earth. Yin softness congeals in form, so its response to things is still—this is called ‘sealing the mechanism of virtue,’ like the deep pool of still water. The work of covering and nurturing is manifest, so its response to things is beautiful—this is called ‘the mechanism of goodness,’ like the deep pool of flowing water. As for ‘supreme harmony where none prevails,’ it is neither moving nor still, neither dead nor alive, neither above nor below, centered like a balance—this is called ‘the mechanism of balanced qi,’ like the deep pool where the great fish coils.

Whether water is still, flowing, or swirling with great fish, the deep pool remains one. Whether Huzi’s mechanism is sealed, released, or in supreme harmony, his Dao remains one. Those who observe water well examine its depths; those who observe people well examine their Dao. Liezi, awakening to Huzi’s Dao, knew his own insufficiency. Since even the diviner could not stand alone, he lost himself and vanished, never to be found again.

Emptied and yielding, unknown as any particular thing, one is without heart and without action. When still, he takes it for drifting reeds—yet none know it as reeds. When moving, he takes it for flowing waves—yet none know it as waves. Seeking me in motion or stillness, he finds nothing—this is why he flees. Feeding pigs as one feeds people is the utmost forgetting of self. Unattached to affairs, one reaches the extreme of emptiness. Carving and polishing only to return to simplicity, standing alone like an unhewn clod—amidst the world’s entanglements, one guards one’s domain to the end, unchanged by all the clamor of the ten thousand things.

Lin’s Annotation:
When Liezi met Jixian, he doubted whether his master’s Dao was inferior. Huzi explained that substance is revealed through form, and the Dao is made manifest in affairs, saying: "You and I have exhausted its form but not its reality—how then can we attain the Dao? It is like a flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? Since you have not yet grasped the reality of my Dao, your Dao still contends with the world and must rely on others’ belief, which is why Jixian could divine your fate. 'Damp ashes' are the sign of impending death.

He showed him *Earth’s Pattern*—without display, there would be no form. Without quaking, there is only stillness and motionlessness. Correctness is constancy, and constancy in the One brings bodily tranquility. Without correctness, there is no Oneness, and this is what constitutes *Earth’s Pattern*. Though virtue possesses a mechanism, it is sealed and not released—something beyond Jixian’s knowledge.

*Heaven and Earth* refers to the work of covering and bearing that has already extended to things, like the Dao’s mechanism issuing from its root while its name and reality have yet to take shape. The *heel* is the lower part of the form. *Utmost goodness* means what is desirable. What Jixian perceived was merely the mechanism.

Huzi called himself *the balance*—what the balance perceives is coarse, while the mechanism contains subtlety. At first, he concealed the mechanism in perfect stillness, and the diviner suspected him dead. Next, he released the mechanism from the utmost depths, and the diviner suspected him alive. Then, neither moving nor still, neither dead nor alive, uneven and irregular, he became impossible to divine.

*The Supreme Unitary* is perfect emptiness at the center. *No Contender*—as *Liezi* says, "No trace." *The Scale* is perfect equilibrium, responding to things with unevenness and irregularity. *Qi* is emptiness awaiting things, yet still not free from mechanism. Huzi concealed his spirit in the boundless, traceless void, where the unevenness of movement and stillness, yin and yang, was like the scale responding to things—thus Jixian could not divine him.

The *you* is a great fish. *Abiding* means settling. Still water forms a deep pool, illustrating *Earth’s Pattern*. Flowing water forms a deep pool, illustrating *Heaven and Earth*. The great fish coils to make its pool, clear or turbid, swift or slow, uneven and irregular—this demonstrates *the Supreme Unitary with no contender*. *Liezi* speaks of nine deep pools; here, three are cited to clarify Huzi’s methods. Even *the Supreme Unitary* is not yet free from the mechanism of qi. As for *not yet having emerged from my source*, one becomes one with Heaven—this is why Jixian lost himself and fled.

Without heart and following things, one is empty and yielding, unknown as any particular person or thing. *Disciple* means to let go. *Yielding* means to follow. If he is to be a disciple, one takes him as a disciple; if he is to be flowing waves, one takes him as flowing waves—this describes Huzi’s transformations as self-contained.

When Liezi witnessed Huzi’s Dao, he awakened to self-realization, feeling as if he had never studied at all. Returning home, he cooked for his wife, fed pigs as he fed people, and no longer distinguished between noble and base or self and others. Unburdened by affairs, he shed ornamentation to return to reality, standing alone like an unhewn clod. Though the world’s affairs were in turmoil, he guarded his domain to the end, unchanged by all the clamor of the ten thousand things.

Detailed Daoist Annotation:
One who wanders with the Dao is without heart, so the mechanisms of life and death, fortune and misfortune dissolve within—impossible to divine. One who engages with the world is encumbered, so the omens of life and death, fortune and misfortune appear without—possible to divine. This is why Jixian could divine the multitude but was confounded by Huzi.

*Earth’s Pattern* is the congealed form of yin softness. *Heaven and Earth* is the visible work of covering and nurturing. *The Supreme Unitary* is the central qi of Heaven and Earth. Yin softness congeals to respond to things with stillness—this is called *sealing the mechanism of virtue*, like the deep pool of still water. The work of covering and nurturing responds to things with beauty—this is called *the mechanism of goodness*, like the deep pool of flowing water. As for *the Supreme Unitary with no contender*, it is neither moving nor still, neither dead nor alive, neither above nor below, balanced at the center like a scale—this is called *the mechanism of qi in equilibrium*, like the deep pool where the *you* coils.

Whether water is still, flowing, or coiled by the *you*, its depth is one. Whether Huzi’s mechanism is sealed, released, or in *the Supreme Unitary*, his Dao is one. Those who skillfully observe water examine its depth; those who skillfully observe people examine their Dao.

Liezi, awakening to Huzi’s Dao, knew his own insufficiency. Since even the diviner could not stand alone, he lost himself and vanished, never to be found again.

Emptied and yielding, unknown as any particular thing, one is without heart and without action. When still, he takes it for drifting reeds—yet none know it as reeds. When moving, he takes it for flowing waves—yet none know it as waves. Seeking me in motion or stillness, he finds nothing—this is why he flees. Feeding pigs as one feeds people is the utmost forgetting of self. Unattached to affairs, one reaches the extreme of emptiness. Carving and polishing only to return to simplicity, standing alone like an unhewn clod—amidst the world’s entanglements, one guards one’s domain to the end, unchanged by all the clamor of the ten thousand things.

Lin’s Annotation:
When Liezi met Jixian, he doubted whether his master’s Dao was inferior. Huzi explained that substance is revealed through form, and the Dao is made manifest in affairs, saying: "You and I have exhausted its form but not its reality—how then can we attain the Dao? It is like a flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? Since you have not yet grasped the reality of my Dao, your Dao still contends with the world and must rely on others’ belief, which is why Jixian could divine your fate. 'Damp ashes' are the sign of impending death."

He showed him *Earth’s Pattern*—without display, there would be no form. Without quaking, there is only stillness and motionlessness. Correctness is constancy, and constancy in the One brings bodily tranquility. Without correctness, there is no Oneness, and this is what constitutes *Earth’s Pattern*.

Though virtue possesses its mechanism, it remains sealed and unmanifest—something beyond his comprehension.

Heaven and Earth perform their covering and bearing functions, extending to all things, yet like the mechanism of virtue and the Dao, though issuing from the root, their name and reality have not yet taken form. The "heel" refers to the lower part of the body. "Utmost goodness" means that which is desirable.

What he perceived was merely the mechanism. Huzi called himself "adaptive power," for adaptability reveals only the coarse, while the mechanism preserves the subtle.

At first, he concealed the mechanism within perfect stillness, and the diviner suspected him dead. Next, he released the mechanism from the lowest extreme, and the diviner suspected him alive. Then, neither moving nor still, neither dead nor alive, uneven and irregular, he became unreadable.

"Supreme Unitary" is utter emptiness at the center. "No sign" refers to what *Liezi* calls "no trace." "Balance" is perfect equilibrium, responding to things with uneven irregularity. *Qi* is emptiness awaiting things, yet still bound to mechanism.

Huzi concealed his spirit in the realm of utter emptiness and tracelessness, where motion and stillness, yin and yang, remain uneven—like a scale responding to weight—so that Jixian could not divine him.

The *you* is a great fish. "Abiding" means settling. Still water forms a deep pool, illustrating *Earth’s Pattern*. Flowing water forms a deep pool, illustrating Heaven and Earth. The great fish coils to make its pool, now clear, now deep, now swift—uneven and irregular—demonstrating the meaning of *Supreme Unitary* and *no sign*.

*Liezi* speaks of nine deep pools; here, three are cited to clarify Huzi’s methods. Even *Supreme Unitary* has not yet escaped the mechanism of *qi*. But when one has "never yet emerged from my origin," one becomes one with Heaven—this is why Jixian lost himself and fled.

Without intention, one follows things, thus empty and yielding, unaware of who or what one is. "Yielding" means letting go. "Following" means compliance. If he becomes yielding, one follows his yielding; if he becomes a flowing wave, one follows the wave—this describes Huzi’s transformations as self-originating.

Seeing Huzi’s Dao, Liezi awakened and realized he had never truly learned. Returning home, he cooked for his wife, fed pigs like a common man, and no longer distinguished between noble and base or self and other. Unburdened by affairs, he discarded ornament for substance, stood alone like an unhewn block, and though matters were chaotic, he guarded his boundaries and never altered.

The *Daoist Commentary* states: Those who wander with the Dao are without intention, so the mechanisms of life and death, fortune and misfortune, vanish within and cannot be divined. Those who engage with the world bear burdens, so the mechanisms of life and death, fortune and misfortune, appear externally and can be divined. This is why Jixian’s divination succeeded with others but failed with Huzi.

*Earth’s Pattern* is the congealed form of yin softness. Heaven and Earth reveal their nurturing function. *Supreme Unitary* is the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth. Yin softness congeals, so its response to things is still—hence the sealed virtue-mechanism, like a still-water pool. The nurturing function appears, so its response to things is beautiful—hence the "goodness-mechanism," like a flowing-water pool. As for *Supreme Unitary* with *no sign*, it is neither moving nor still, neither dead nor alive, neither above nor below, centered like a scale—hence the "balanced *qi*-mechanism," like the pool where the great fish coils.

Still, flowing, or coiled by the great fish, the deep pool remains one. Sealed, released, or in *Supreme Unitary*, Huzi’s Dao remains one. Those who observe water well examine its depth; those who observe people well examine their Dao.

Liezi, awakening to Huzi’s Dao, knew his own insufficiency. When reality does not enter, the heart does not stir. Only in perfect stillness does the mechanism emerge from the lowest extreme—the origin of the body’s vitality. Nurtured, it becomes vast *qi*; expanded, it becomes all-pervading benevolence. This is called "continuing one’s nature and manifesting it," ceaselessly generating life.

Again seeing Huzi, he marveled at his uneven motion and stillness, his unreadability—such are the wondrous workings of the perfected, transcending all calculation. *Supreme Unitary* is emptiness at its utmost, so no trace or sign can be perceived. The scale, perfectly balanced, responds well. *Qi*, utterly empty, enters well. Both are without intention toward things, so they respond spontaneously without awaiting stimulus—yet they are called "mechanisms" in terms of what they reveal.

The three deep pools illustrate the profound meaning of the three mechanisms. Though *Liezi* mentions nine, citing only three was enough to exhaust Jixian’s skill. The perfected do not intend to astonish or overpower others; they merely reveal "never yet emerged from my origin"—a non-revelation, a traceless origin, nothing but emptiness. What emergence or entry could there be? Thus, the more Huzi’s revelations approached truth, the further Jixian’s divinations strayed—no wonder he lost himself and fled.

Once Jixian was obliterated and lost, Huzi too became as nothing. Then what was Liezi to do? Realizing that all he had previously learned was mere earth and stubble, he now recognized the true Dao. Amidst chaos, he guarded his boundaries and held to this to the end—this is what it means to exhaust the Dao.

This chapter truly embodies the subtle principle of "responding to emperors and kings," using Jixian’s divination to reveal the wonder of Huzi’s Dao, so that those intoxicated by divination’s artifice might awaken a little.

"With you and I"—*with* means approval, as in Confucius’ "I approve of Zeng Dian." "Having exhausted its form"—one version reads "without form," where Heaven’s curving in the northwest is "without" (adding *卜* to *无* makes *无*, and *既* is a variant). "Not correct" should read "not still." "Uneven" is read as written. "No sign" is undoubtedly *朕*. The character *審* in "three deep pools" in *Liezi* is written as *潘*, pronounced *pan*, meaning "water coiling in a hollow."

The *Pronunciation and Meaning* of this classic states: Sima’s edition writes *蟠* (coil), meaning "to gather," which may approximate the sense. *弟靡* (dī mǐ) in the old commentary is glossed as *颓* (decline), though its source is unclear; here, following the *Liezi* text, *茅靡* (máo mǐ) is correct. As the wind over grass must bend it, this better accords with the following imagery of "waves and flow."

*Southern Florescence True Classic: Ocean of Subtle Meanings, Scroll Twenty-One* concludes.

By Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin
"Responding to Emperors and Kings, Part Three"

Body free of fame’s corpse, mind free of schemes’ storehouse,
hands free of tasks’ burden, spirit free of knowledge’s lordship.
Embrace the boundless to its end and wander without trace;
exhaust what Heaven has bestowed, yet perceive no gain—
it is emptiness alone.

The perfected one’s heart-mind works like a mirror:
neither chasing nor welcoming, responding yet not retaining.
Thus it masters things without harm.

Guo’s commentary:
Things naturally assume their names and each devises its own schemes;
things naturally bear their tasks and govern their knowledge.
Following the world’s self-so, one drives ten thousand things without limit.
Exhausting what Heaven has bestowed, one stops when full.
To perceive gain is to know no stopping; without emptiness, one cannot bear the solid.

The heart-mind like a mirror reflects without emotion:
what comes is met, what goes is released.
Thus, though the world entire comes to be mirrored, there is no weariness of spirit.

Lü’s commentary:
Free of fame’s corpse, I have no name, and all under Heaven cannot name me.
Free of schemes’ storehouse, I do not scheme, and all under Heaven schemes for me.
Free of tasks’ burden, I do nothing, and those who bear tasks shoulder responsibility.
Free of knowledge’s lordship, I have no concerns, and all under Heaven concerns itself for me.
Embracing the boundless to its end is the utmost of vastness.
Wandering without trace, even spirits cannot perceive—
how much less can men?

If so, one exhausts what Heaven has bestowed yet perceives no gain—
this is what is meant by “constantly relying on nature without augmenting life.”
The so-called emptiness: is it emptiness only after emptying?
My heart-mind is originally empty.

Its heart-mind like a mirror:
not chasing, what has passed leaves no residue;
not welcoming, what has not come cannot be foreseen.
Responding yet not retaining, what is present cannot be grasped.
Exhausting what Heaven has bestowed in this way,
one masters things without harm.

Lin’s commentary:
The perfected one’s heart-mind: when things stir, it penetrates;
when affairs conclude, it is still—like a mirror.
Bright, without emotion, it responds to things, and beauty or ugliness cannot deceive.
This is called “mastering things without harm.”
The perfected one does not contend, yet right and wrong cannot deceive;
following time and complying with principle, even spirits cannot harm him.

Xiang Dao’s commentary:
A mirror’s relation to things: when they arrive, it responds,
yet its light does not conceal.
When they depart, it lets them go, and its light remains unchanged.
It does not welcome their coming nor chase their going;
the myriad things do not exhaust it, yet it responds to them.
Constantly empty and without intent—
this is how it masters things without harm.

From “free of fame’s corpse” to “perceive no gain”:
through the heart-mind’s emptiness, one attains the Dao.
From “the perfected one’s heart-mind” to “responding yet not retaining”:
through the Dao’s emptiness, one reaches its use.

Bixu’s commentary:
To be fame’s corpse is to exhaust one’s form;
to be schemes’ storehouse is to endanger one’s spirit;
to bear tasks’ burden is to deplete one’s talent;
to be knowledge’s lord is to cloud one’s understanding.
Not embracing to the end is to be bounded;
leaving traces is to be unfit for wandering.
Exhausting what Heaven has bestowed is simply to bear it.
To perceive and gain is not wondrous—
no perception is emptiness alone.

The heart-mind like a mirror: when things come, it reflects them.
They come and go on their own, and beauty or ugliness is not concealed.
Without intent to master things, things cannot harm it.

Yongqi’s note:
“Free of fame’s corpse” means “doing good without approaching fame.”
“Free of schemes’ storehouse” means “without schemes, what use is knowledge?”
“Free of tasks’ burden” means “though affairs cannot be left undone, one does not take tasks upon oneself.”
“Free of knowledge’s lordship” means “though one cannot be without knowledge, one does not take knowledge as lord.”
These four “free of” are prohibitive, like the four “not” in the *Analects*.

“Embrace” means to perceive and see.
Perceiving the Dao to its end without limit,
the heart-mind wanders in the beginning of no-thing.
Heaven bestows this principle upon me;
I exhaust it yet do not consider it a gain.
To perceive gain is to verge on advancement.

Pushao concludes this passage with “emptiness” as its core.
The lines from “the heart-mind like a mirror” onward
simply explicate this one word, “emptiness.”
The prose rises and falls, and within its plainness lies divine subtlety—
is this not wondrous?

Zhao Xuzhai treats this passage and the “Emperor of the Southern Sea” as one chapter,
but his commentary is brief and does not discuss it.

Note: This passage continues from the preceding chapter on Ji Zhai,
summarizing its meaning as the text’s flow makes clear.
“Fame’s corpse,” “schemes’ storehouse,” “tasks’ burden,” and “knowledge’s lordship”
refer to Ji Zhai relying on knowledge and schemes to scrutinize things,
seeking fame and bearing tasks.
From “embracing the boundless to its end” onward
speaks of Master Hu’s Dao as unfathomable.
“The perfected one” clearly refers to Master Hu.
Not intending to master things, yet unable not to master them—
this is how Ji Zhai lost himself and fled.
Only by not contending can one skillfully master things;
how then could one be harmed?
This further clarifies that relying on the Dao, its use is boundless,
while relying on skill, one’s ability is limited.

The Emperor of the Southern Sea was Shu,
the Emperor of the Northern Sea was Hu,
and the Emperor of the Central Realm was Hundun.
Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land,
and Hundun treated them very well.
Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s virtue, saying:
“All men have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—
only this one has none. Let us try to bore them.”
Each day they bored one aperture,
and on the seventh day, Hundun died.

Guo’s commentary:
To act is to ruin it.

Lü’s commentary:
The Southern Yang symbolizes the manifest and having;
the Northern Yin symbolizes the sudden and nothingness.
The Center is neither having nor nothingness—
this is how they meet and unite.
Though Shu and Hu differ from Hundun,
Hundun never differed from them, so they treated him very well.
Knowing his goodness and plotting to repay it,
they bored apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing,
daily piercing him to connect with things—
how could his simplicity not be lost?

Yi Du’s commentary:
The Dao’s body is whole as Hundun;
when divided, it becomes Shu and Hu.

Its essence resides within, its coarse aspects without;
dividing the center to make a south—this is how the Dao is lost.
Those who lose the Dao must begin from without,
hence they meet in the land of Hundun.
Hundun admits of no impossibility,
thus it is said they treated him very well.
Boring one aperture each day
shows how harm arises.
On the seventh day, Hundun died—
this means that before the number reaches its limit,
it is already enough to lose the Dao.

Xiang Dao’s commentary:
Yin and Yang unite to form Hundun;
Hundun disperses into Yin and Yang.
To prefer union over dispersal is to wield it without fixed form;
to bore into union from dispersal is to make it easily ruined.
*Laozi* says: "There are images, there are things, there is essence"—
this refers to Hundun, Shu, and Hu.
Plotting to repay Hundun’s virtue is to use feeling to extinguish the Dao;
boring apertures until Hundun dies is to use the human to extinguish Heaven.
"Seven days" means that before the number is exhausted,
it is already enough to kill Hundun.

Bixu’s commentary:
The Southern Emperor embodies active endeavor,
the Northern Emperor embodies non-action,
and the Central Emperor embodies great simplicity.
Before the three qi divide, it is called "Hun";
before the five phases manifest, it is called "Dun."
With having and nothingness undivided,
it is said: "They treated him very well."
The Southern and Northern Emperors did not recognize Hundun’s truth
and rashly undertook empty boring,
leading to the scattering of simplicity.
*Laozi* says: "Open its apertures, hasten its affairs—
throughout life, it will never be fathomed."
This is the case.

Wu Chou’s commentary:
Shu is dark yet has form;
Hu is subtle yet has number.
When Hundun’s whole body disperses,
it is called the Central Emperor—
yet it does not depart from between Shu and Hu.
Thus, when Shu and Hu meet,
it is none other than the land of Hundun.
They treated him very well because he was impartial and selfless;
plotting to repay his virtue made them partial and intentional.
The Dao’s whole body would suffer harm,
so before the number was exhausted,
the "Hun" divided and the "Dun" scattered—
this is why it is called death.

Zhao’s commentary:
The first four chapters of *Responding to Emperors and Kings* discuss the Dao of governing the world,
while the latter chapter clarifies the earlier meaning and ascribes merit to Hundun’s virtue.
The South is *Li*, governing the eyes and overseeing seeing;
the North is *Kan*, governing the ears and overseeing hearing.
To rely on the keen clarity of ears and eyes
and force what one does not know
is to begin to depart from one’s true nature.
This is why the wise act without contrivance and detest boring.

Yong Qi states: This passage merely speaks of how keen perception and intelligence can burden the self, hence its use as an illustration. To block the limbs and shut off perception and intelligence is to become Hundun. Originally a plain observation, it was crafted into the tale of boring one aperture each day—truly a stroke of genius. Hundun is primordial qi. The human body possesses seven apertures, like a newborn infant: though eyes, ears, nose, and mouth are formed, it lacks knowledge—this is the wholeness of Hundun. When knowledge sprouts and likes, dislikes, joys, and angers arise, the apertures of Hundun are bored. *Mencius* says: "The great man does not lose the heart of a newborn infant"—this is Hundun unborrowed. Zhuangzi’s inversion of the tale renders it even more extraordinary. Who among later scholars could match such ingenuity?

This chapter comprises seventy-four characters. Guo Xiang cites a line from the *Daodejing* to encapsulate it, concise and precise beyond compare. After careful reflection, I offer my humble insight, appended to the existing commentaries:

What the *Nanhua Jing* calls Hundun is akin to what the *Daodejing* terms "pristine unity" (*hun cheng*) and the *Chongxu Jing* calls "primordial chaos" (*hun lun*)—all metaphors for the Dao’s complete, originally endowed, and uncontrived whole. Yet as the world waxes and wanes, the Dao moves with the times: gradually transforming into being, suddenly into non-being, its body thus fractured. The progression from one to three does not yet reach the point of boring; but when beings meet in the realm of Hundun, things interact and the mind arises—like fire added to kindling, an inevitable principle. Hundun, undivided, is perfectly suited to this state. Had Shun and Hu not been moved by sentiment and sought to repay its virtue, Hundun’s □ power would have remained unmarred. Thus they could not escape the entanglement of harm born from kindness: boring one aperture each day, the calamity entered through severance. After seven days, Hundun died—its emotional apertures opened, and its harmonious qi was lost. How fitting!

The path of emperors and kings, once trodden, leads to the demise of the great Dao’s essence—how is this different? The ancient rulers who responded to emperors and kings governed through non-action, and the myriad things transformed; they were desireless, and the world was content; profound and still, the hundred clans were settled. This was the proven efficacy of Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties, which later kings emulated to establish enduring norms. How could those who know governance—rushing to scheme and expand—compare? Thus, the *Nanhua* begins this chapter with Nie Que’s question to Wang Ni, using Yu’s parable to illustrate overthinking and Tai’s to exemplify non-action. Non-action suffices to match Heaven, which is what emperors and kings must embody, the mandate they inherit, and the trust of the countless people!

Yet those who devise standards and measures to transform the world’s people differ not from hunters who net birds and trap rodents—only hastening their flight into lofty skies or deep burrows. More action breeds intention; intention gives rise to schemes, from which deceit is born. Even the natural bond between father and son cannot remain secure; how then, in the relationship between ruler and people, can one hope for the mutual oblivion of wild deer and branches? Thus, when Tian Gen asked how to govern the world, the answer was: "Calm the mind, still the qi, follow things without partiality." When Zi Ju asked about the enlightened king’s rule, the answer was: "Forget merit, bestow goodness, let things delight themselves"—all ways to respond to emperors and kings through non-action. Those who possess the world and its states should seek it here.

Zheng had a divine diviner who foretold life and death, illustrating how strategists who scrutinize governance can predict a state’s rise and fall, discerning the subtle before it manifests—truly the oracle bones of their age. Yet upon first seeing Master Hu, they mourned his impending death; upon seeing him again, they rejoiced at his recovery; a third time, they doubted his uneven state, unable to divine anything. Thus, the limits of reading forms and faces became clear. When they saw him again, they fled in dismay—how mutable was Master Hu, and how un-divine was Ji Xian!

This shows that those who predict a state’s fate through schemes and calculations cannot transcend human artifice, and their use is thus finite. But the ruler who embodies non-action, modeling Heaven and the Dao, sitting in stillness while his spirit reaches the four directions, merging with transformation without limit—majestic and boundless, beyond the people’s comprehension—how can schemes measure him, or arts and numbers fathom him?

The chapter concludes with the two emperors of the South and North meeting at the center, illustrating how the Dao disperses into things, departing from non-being into being. Shun and Hu are but alternate names for being and non-being, the division of the subtle and wondrous. Their reunion is not without merit, yet where there is one, there is dispersion—hence the boring by Shun and Hu. Only by treating it well must there be those who bore well; better to transform without intention, to forget and interact in mutual transformation.

A ten-thousand-hu boat cannot hold a needle’s drip—how surprising that Hundun died after seven days! Privately, I reflect: the *Nanhua Jing* overflows with torrents of vast and surging eloquence, innovating and astonishing, towering above the other masters as if beyond the reach of rules and standards. Yet the profundity of its *Inner Chapters*—probing the divine, exhausting transformation, threading the Dao through Heaven and humanity—stands as a solemn and rigorous system, on par with the *Yijing* and *Laozi*. Beginners who fail to grasp its essence are scarcely less dazzled than by the five colors of Zhuangzi’s "floriate language."

Examining its creative intent and structured discourse, beginning with *Free and Easy Wandering* and concluding with *Responding to Emperors and Kings*, the essentials of learning the Dao lie in returning to seek within oneself, finding joy in all circumstances. Then, observing the myriad things externally, one sees that principles are without distinction. When things are equalized, the self is forgotten, and the master of nurturing life is attained. Nurturing life is to perfect oneself; responding to the world is to perfect things—both depend on virtue’s fulfillment. When virtue is full, the myriad things align in harmony.

The master as ancestral teacher establishes the origin of the Dao, setting a model for all under heaven, extending the lifeline of sages and worthies, and dispersing the clouds of delusion for ten thousand generations—thus the foundation of *The Great Ancestral Master* is laid. Applied to the art of governance, what difficulty could there be? Internally, one becomes a sage or spirit; externally, one responds as emperor or king. This is how the Dao, when gathered within the self, is never in excess, and when dispersed throughout the world, is never insufficient.

Though the achievements of emperors and kings are said to be but the surplus of sages, to elevate the world to true purity and lead the people to clarity and stillness, to respond to transformation and perfect governance—nothing surpasses this. Thus it concludes the purport of the *Inner Chapters*. Jiao and Hu were born, yet Hun Dun died—this metaphor illustrates how the success of external kingship may come at the cost of the inner sagely Way. Nowadays, many are those who bore openings into Hun Dun and so cause his death. How then shall we revive him?

It is said: "Block the apertures, close the gates, and employ them without strain." Is this not the true method for cultivating Hun Dun’s continuity?

Examining further the titles of the seven chapters, each has its governing principle. Though some examples may be dense and their distinctions blurred, I have surmised their essential aims and paired them with those whose virtue aligns with the ancients:

The ultimate discourse of *Free and Easy Wandering* rightly belongs to Xu You and Song Rong, who dissolved the world’s extreme entanglements of desire to preserve each one’s heavenly nature.

The ultimate discourse of *The Equality of Things* rightly belongs to Ziqi and Wang Ni, who loosened the delusions of self and other, is and isn’t, to attain their fundamental sameness and accord with the Great Thoroughfare.

The ultimate discourse of *The Secret of Nurturing Life* rightly belongs to Lao Dan and Peng Zu, who corrected the errors of over-cultivating the bodily form to know what should come first in the Way of life.

The ultimate discourse of *Fit for Human Society* rightly belongs to Huan Huan and Jie Yu, who clarified the proper timing of withdrawal and engagement, lest one provoke the dragon’s scales and invite calamity.

The ultimate discourse of *The Sign of Full Virtue* rightly belongs to Wang Tai and Shentu Jia, who showed that inner fullness requires no external validation, and that when virtue abounds, things cannot depart from it.

The ultimate discourse of *The Great Ancestral Master* rightly belongs to Confucius and Yan Hui, who possessed sagely virtue yet did not occupy its position, but magnified this Dao to awaken the people.

The ultimate discourse of *Responding to Emperors and Kings* rightly belongs to Shun and Yu alone, to whom the pivot of song and litigation returns—responding to heaven and following the people not by choice, but by necessity. Here, the *Nanhua* aspires to the ancient sages and worthies, inscribing their standards for ten thousand generations.

As for the attainments of the perfected person: they neither cling to the seven chapters nor depart from them, yet harmonize with their spirit. Thus they externally blend with the dust and light, while internally preserving luminous insight, moving between subtlety and sageliness, opening and closing with the transformations of the mechanism—unbound by the constraints of formal teaching.

Those who would truly study the *Nanhua* should seek within the *Inner Chapters*, and their understanding will be more than half complete.

**The Outer Chapters: "Webbed Toes" – First**

Webbed toes and supernumerary fingers arise from nature—yet they exceed in virtue. Pendulous growths and dangling wens emerge from form—yet they exceed in nature. Those who multiply methods of benevolence and righteousness and apply them are arrayed within the five viscera—yet this is not the rectitude of the Dao and virtue.

Thus, toes fused together are but useless flesh conjoined; fingers branching from the hand are but useless digits grown. Those who multiply methods and branch them within the passions of the five viscera indulge in perverse conduct through benevolence and righteousness, proliferating the use of their keen perception.

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
Webbed and branched limbs all arise from form and nature; they are not borrowed from external things. Whether fused or not, each suffices in its nature. Yet these alone are fused and branched, thus exceeding their nature—hence they are called excessive. Some say this is not nature and seek to excise it, but this would mean the Dao has no place to abide, virtue has no vessel to bear it, humans discard what is essential, and things reject their proper use—how could this accord with the intent of perfect governance?

Things have small and large, abilities have few and many; what is large is fused, what is many is superfluous. The distinction between fusion and superfluity exists in all things. If none are employed, this is to abandon the nature of the myriad things entirely. Those who merge with things do not multiply.

Thus, those who multiply methods of benevolence and righteousness spread them across the five viscera, yet this is merely the rectitude of one school—unable to harmonize with things without distinction or align each with its proper nature and destiny. The few and many of methods have no fixed limit; the difference between few and many has a definite measure. They cannot encroach upon one another. Each guarding its measure, none fail to find their own fulfillment.

Some, hearing that multiplicity is insufficient to rectify the few, seek to discard the many and rely on the few—this is to cast aside the entire world. Is this not delusion? Webbed toes and branched fingers arise simply because nature and destiny cannot be otherwise; they do not exist for any use. Just so, the passions of the five viscera naturally multiply in methods. Yet those with fewer methods forcibly exalt them, leading to perversion and losing the perfect equilibrium within the body.

Keen perception has its proper measure: multiplicity is not excess, paucity is not deficiency. Yet the sway of passions and desires never fails to despise the few and prize the many. If one forgets what is prized and preserves one’s inherent measure, then in nature there is no excess, and all distinctions are complete.

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:**
Webbed toes and supernumerary fingers do not fail to arise from nature, yet virtue does not possess them. Pendulous growths and dangling wens do not fail to emerge from form, yet nature does not possess them. To have what is not possessed—this is why they are excessive.

Qi configures as the five phases, virtue as the five constants, affairs as the five practices, and form as the five viscera. Thus, those who multiply methods of benevolence and righteousness are not absent from the five viscera—yet they are not the rectitude of the Dao and virtue, for these too are what is not possessed. Therefore, toes fused and fingers branched are both useless; what is called the rectitude of the Dao and virtue is simply non-action returning to unity.

**Lin Yidu’s Commentary:**
Webbed and branched limbs are born with form—arising from nature. Wens and growths arise from form—emerging from form. Nature corresponds to virtue: nature resides in Heaven, virtue in humans. Form contrasts with nature: nature is internal, form external. What arises from Heaven, humans deem excessive; what emerges from the external, the internal deems excessive—this is the principle of nature.

Transformation, righteousness, and the Dao and virtue never fail to interact, yet the paths of benevolence and righteousness are despised by the Dao and virtue as wens and growths are despised by form. Webbed limbs illustrate the root of benevolence and righteousness; wens and growths illustrate their offshoots. Form and nature illustrate the rectitude of the Dao and virtue.

Webbed limbs arise from nature and cannot be removed—just as the root of benevolence and righteousness also arises from nature. Wens and growths emerge from form and can be removed—just as the offshoots of benevolence and righteousness arise from human artifice and can thus be discarded. If one can forget the descriptions of transformation and righteousness, one merges with the principle of nature and destiny, becoming one with the Dao and virtue. Forgetting the encumbrance of bodily form, even webbed limbs arise from form and nature, equal to the four limbs. Wens and growths are external to form; the imposition of benevolence and righteousness is external to nature. Removing them preserves form; forgetting them unifies the Dao.

**Chen Xiangdao’s Commentary:**
Nature is established through virtue; form is completed through nature. Webbed toes and supernumerary fingers have no place in virtue—hence they are called excessive to nature. The beginnings of benevolence and righteousness are present at birth—these are the fused branches of the Dao. Yet their use appears only after birth—these are the growths and wens of the Dao.

People know that fused limbs are useless and growths are burdensome, yet they do not realize that the practice of benevolence and righteousness is the same. When the Dao and virtue are esteemed, benevolence and righteousness become useless; when benevolence and righteousness are employed, the Dao and virtue become encumbered.

**Chen Jingyuan’s (Bixuzi) Commentary:**
Webbed and branched limbs are born with life—thus they arise from nature and are the surplus of life and virtue. Wens and growths arise after birth—thus they emerge from form and are external burdens to nature. Hence both are called excessive.

When the five phases are balanced, the five constants are unbiased—this is the rectitude of the Dao and virtue. Yet to multiply benevolence and righteousness is to have some among the five viscera’s qi endowment receive less—thus it is not the rectitude of the Dao and virtue. Moreover, webbed and branched limbs on hands and feet are merely useless digits—what harm could they do? Yet when the passions of the five viscera are fused and branched, indulging in perverse conduct through benevolence and righteousness and multiplying the use of keen perception, this is to fuse and branch in useful places—thus compounding the harm.

**Lin Xiyi’s (*Yongzhai Oral Teachings*) Commentary:**
What is born with life arises from nature; what humans alone possess is called virtue. Webbed limbs arise naturally, yet compared to what all humans share, they are excessive.

Excess growths and warts are likewise burdensome. Here, the terms "nature" and "virtue" slightly diverge from those in our sacred scriptures. "Multifarious" means manifold. To list them among the five viscera—this is to say they do not arise from within, hence they are not the rectitude of the Dao and virtue.

Gaozi spoke of righteousness as external; Zhuangzi went further, deeming benevolence external as well. To regard benevolence and righteousness as perverse excesses and to speak of them alongside keen perception—all this is to reject the learning of inward cultivation, thus revealing only their meddlesomeness.

**Master Chu’s (*Guanjian*) Insight:**
What Heaven commands is called nature; what things receive to live by is called virtue; to embody and fulfill virtue and nature is called form. All these are endowed by the natural, and thus one venerates life to align with the Dao, embodying Heaven to establish the ultimate, being utterly sincere without cease.

Anything beyond virtue and nature is but excess growths and warts—what is meant by "manifold in benevolence, righteousness, and keen perception," yet not the rectitude of the Dao and virtue. Thus, Master Zhuang of Qiyuan placed this discourse at the head of the *Outer Chapters*, and critics called his disparagement of benevolence and righteousness excessive. Yet the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi did not scorn benevolence and righteousness out of a fondness for loftiness; rather, when the Dao and virtue are honored, benevolence and righteousness are already within them. However, the benevolence and righteousness of that era were mostly excessive and offshoots, not the true essence. Thus, they had no choice but to refute and reject them. If benevolence and righteousness were rooted in the heart and practiced in accord with principle, how far would they be from the Dao and virtue?

Excess growths and warts are temporary gatherings of qi, initially causing no pain or itch—leaving them be incurs no harm. Yet some, disliking their burden on the body, seek to excise them, only to cause greater harm. Thus, the perfected person skillfully employs analogies to dispel confusion, hoping scholars will inwardly comprehend and intuitively grasp the truth, distinguishing the false to reveal the real. Then the supreme principle of Heaven’s mandate may be fully attained, and the noble worth of life restored to the unity of Dao and things. Heaven and humanity merge, and looking back, excess growths and warts are no burden to our form. What is called keen perception and benevolence and righteousness all arise from our virtue and nature—these, too, are subtle manifestations of the Dao. Yet if one does not follow their traces to seek goodness in things but instead reflects to return to the root and unite with the great harmony, one ultimately returns to the mystery of the Dao and virtue. Where then is perversity?

The phrase "manifold in the use of keen perception" appears thus in all current editions. Chen Jingyuan of *Bixuzi* noted that Zhang Junfang’s collated edition omits the character "manifold," citing the later phrase "excess in perception" as evidence—his argument is quite extensive.

Thus, to be excessive in clarity is to disorder the five colors, to indulge in ornate patterns, to dazzle with azure and yellow, embroidery and brocade—is this not so? And is this not Li Zhu? To be excessive in perception is to disorder the five sounds, to indulge in the six pitch-pipes, the tones of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo, the notes of *huangzhong* and *dalü*—is this not so? And is this not Shi Kuang?

To branch in benevolence is to pluck virtue and obstruct nature, to seek fame and reputation, causing the world to clamor in praise of unattainable standards—is this not so? And are these not Zengzi and Shi Yu? To be excessive in eloquence is to pile tiles and knot cords, to twist phrases, to roam the mind amid debates of hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference, and to exhaust oneself in vain praise of useless words—is this not so? And are these not Yang Zhu and Mo Di?

All these are manifold offshoots of the Dao, not the ultimate rectitude of the world. That which is truly rectified does not lose the truth of its nature and destiny. Thus, what is joined is not called excess; what is branched is not called divergent. What is long is not called surplus; what is short is not called deficient. Therefore, though the legs of the owl are short, lengthening them brings sorrow; though the legs of the crane are long, severing them brings grief. Thus, what is long by nature should not be cut; what is short by nature should not be extended—then there is nothing to remove, and sorrow departs.

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
Those with ears and eyes are never troubled by envying the deaf and blind; their trouble lies in admiring Li Zhu and Shi Kuang. Yet Li Zhu and Shi Kuang, though keen of perception, disrupt the mastery of ears and eyes. Zengzi and Shi Yu were long in benevolence, but those short in it forcibly emulate them. To emulate them in benevolence is to make benevolence false. The world never admires Jie and Zhi but must admire Zengzi and Shi Yu—thus Zengzi and Shi Yu’s clamor misleads the world, causing it to lose its true nature more than Jie and Zhi ever did. To gallop in eloquence and craft perilous words is never to pause in the speech of Taozha but to vie in disputation between Yang Zhu and Mo Di—thus Yang Zhu and Mo Di disrupt the mastery of pure words.

Those several masters followed their natural endowments, each multiplying offshoots and taking their own way as rectitude. Yet to take one’s rectitude as the standard for all is to make all unrectified. Thus, the ultimately rectified do not use their own rectitude to govern the world but allow the world each to attain its own rectitude. Viewed thus, the ultimately rectified is evident.

To use branches to rectify the trunk is to call the trunk excess. To use the trunk to rectify branches is to call branches deformities. To use the short to rectify the long is to call the long surplus. To use the long to rectify the short is to call the short deficient. Each has its own rectitude; one cannot use this to rectify that and thereby diminish or obscure it. Knowing that the allotment of nature cannot be cut or extended and leaving it be, there is nothing to remove, and sorrow departs of itself.

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:**
"Clarity" means to see of itself; now, to take what is seen as clarity is to join one’s self-seeing with what is seen, making it excessive. "Perception" means to hear of itself; yet sounds, pitch-pipes, and strings are all external—thus they are multiplied and made excessive. The source from which the Dao emerges is the free flow of nature’s spontaneity—then the world is sufficient in itself and not surplus.

To pluck virtue is to force growth; to obstruct nature is to stifle what gives life. Only by overdoing it to seek fame does the world drum in unison to uphold unattainable standards—this is how Zengzi and Shi Yu branched in benevolence. The Dao lies in non-speech, thus eloquence is not the Dao. Tiles are valued when aligned like scales, but piling them burdens; cords are valued when straight, but knotting them entangles; phrases serve to convey meaning, yet twisting them hides it. The mind is valued for emptiness, yet it advances into debates of hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference, exhausting conduct in vain praise of useless words—like piling tiles and knotting cords, this is how Yang Zhu and Mo Di were excessive in eloquence.

All these fall short of the ultimate correctness of the world. That which is ultimately correct never loses the true nature of life and destiny, thus it acts without contrivance and remains naturally unaltered. Lin Yi’s solitary note: Those who are paired in brightness are confused by the five colors, unaware that the Dao within may be inwardly perceived. Those who are excessive in hearing are confused by the five sounds, unaware that the harmony of soundlessness lies beyond the reach of hearing. Branching into the seven apertures leads to dissipation, hence they pluck virtue and obstruct nature to gather fame, causing the world to resonate like blowing reeds or striking bells, mutually fanning and stirring to uphold their laws, ever feeling inadequate.

Those paired in eloquence speak as if piling tiles in peril, their grasp as firm as knotted cords. Heretical doctrines, subtle and obscure, are called "concealed phrases"; stubbornly clinging to debates on "white horses" and "difference and sameness," they expend effort on useless words—all these are the ways of excessive pairing and branching, not the ultimate correctness of the world. The ultimate correctness of the world is the Dao and virtue. Dao and virtue arise from the principles of life and destiny alone. That which is truly correct corrects things but is not corrected by things; it does not lose the true nature of life and destiny, and the distinctions of the myriad things become clear.

Thus, what is joined is not called paired, what branches is not called deformed, what is long is not called excessive, and what is short is not called insufficient. Each follows its natural allotment, and worries have no place to linger and thus vanish of themselves. Chen Xiangdao’s note: Displaying virtue and obstructing nature exemplify Zeng Shen’s excessive benevolence toward his parents and Shi Qiu’s excessive benevolence toward his lord. Piling tiles and knotting cords describe perilous words, exhausting oneself in praise. The sage has no fame, yet those who branch into benevolence seek it; the benevolent have no worries, yet the benevolent are beset by many, thus they are far from the Dao.

Deformities like paired toes do not naturally arise from the body, nor do benevolence and righteousness naturally arise from the Dao. When the body abides in its natural state, paired toes are no burden—thus what is joined is not called paired, and what branches is not called deformed. When the Dao abides in its natural state, benevolence and righteousness are no hindrance—thus one preserves virtue and nurtures nature, and that is all. Yet people of this age, already ensnared in the exhaustion of benevolence and righteousness, still gaze in distress, like those with paired toes or branched limbs. The unbenevolent, forcing benevolence and righteousness to glut themselves on wealth and honor, violate the true nature of life and destiny, becoming like those with paired toes.

Chen Bixu’s note: Paired toes, compared to the five digits, are deemed insufficient. Excessive brightness, with its doubled nature, is called excessive. The sage withdraws sight and reverses hearing to cultivate inner illumination; worldly customs admire Li Zhu and Shi Kuang’s keen sight and hearing, indulging the senses in external sights and sounds, exhausting their bodies. Thus, Li and Shi Kuang become the leaders of those who disorder ears and eyes! Those who branch into benevolence pluck virtue and obstruct nature to gather fame, rushing about in all directions and losing their true nature—thus Zeng and Shi become the patriarchs of those who delude the human heart.

Eloquence deployed in all directions is like piling tiles in layers; the transmission of learning is like knotting cords in tangles. Subtle and abstruse debates—are these not what "concealed phrases" and hidden words refer to? Wandering in eccentricity—are these not what "separating and uniting, affirming and negating" refer to? Praising minor doctrines—are these not what "exhausting jade tablets without progress" refer to? Great eloquence appears inarticulate, for much speech leads to frequent impasses—thus Yang Zhu and Mo Di become the chiefs of those who indulge in extravagant and perverse theories.

All excess or deficiency in form and nature fall short of the ultimate correctness of the Dao. To possess one’s correct nature and be able to correct oneself is called "true correctness." To compel others to follow oneself or to follow others is to lose the true nature of life and destiny. What is joined is not called paired, what branches is not called deformed—this is forgetting the body. The crane’s sinews are not severed, the hare’s sinews are not extended; with no cause for worry, worries vanish of themselves.

*Fuzhai’s Meanings* states: The five colors and patterns were used in ancient times to nurture the eyes, yet Zhuangzi deemed them chaotic and excessive, echoing Laozi’s "the five colors blind the eyes." Li Zhu was one who relied on brightness—if one deems this wrong, those who rely on brightness would deem it right. The same applies to those excessive in hearing. Virtue and nature are fundamentally still, yet forcing oneself into benevolence is to pluck virtue and obstruct nature, causing the world to be deluded and stirred into upholding unfeasible laws. Words that are verbose yet insipid are like piling tiles and knotting cords; altering phrases to argue is to roam the mind among debates on hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference.

"Exhausting steps" means laborious toil. Such words are useless yet praised with self-satisfaction, merely self-inflicted toil—if one deems this wrong, then Yang and Mo’s followers deem it right. Excessive pairing and branching refer to all superfluous matters, not the ultimate correctness. "True correctness" means being naturally so, not losing the true principle of life and destiny. Thus, what is joined is not called paired, what branches is not called deformed, what is long is not called excessive, and what is short is not called insufficient. These lines convey the meaning of "great as a hair, small as a mountain."

"Deformity" means rising; to have something deformed is to be unbalanced and unrestrained. The crane’s long legs and the hare’s short legs arise from their inherent nature; what nature finds at ease has no worry to dispel. "Why do the benevolent have so many worries?"—Yao, Shun, Confucius, and Mencius are all included in this! This passage elucidates the previous idea: each person has a correct nature, each nature has its inherent capacities, and each capacity has its proper measure—even a hair’s breadth cannot be forcibly altered. Thus, those who admire Li Zhu lose their brightness; those who emulate Shi Kuang harm their hearing.

Those who emulate Zengzi and Shishu exceed in benevolence; those who study Yangzi and Mozi deviate into contention. These all strive for what they lack to attain what others possess, elevating themselves to match others, clinging without end—this is not the ultimate correctness of the world.

That ultimate correctness fulfills the true nature of life without longing or envy. People rest content in their allotted roles, and things find their proper place: joined yet not called fused, branched yet not called deformed, long and short each fitting without the burden of excess or insufficiency. The world’s worries cease, vanishing of themselves without need for removal.

This is called "fulfilling one’s own nature and then fulfilling the nature of things." Thus, the joy of preserving things is the very joy of preserving oneself!

Upon examining the classic text, *jingwa* (景瓦) should likely be *leijiu* (累九). Where it reads *zhengzheng* (正正), it ought to follow the preceding passage as *zhizheng* (至正). *Bu wei ba* (不为跋) should be *qi* (岐). These are all errors in transcription.

**Outer Chapters: "Webbed Toes and Extra Fingers" (Second)**

Is it not that benevolence and righteousness run counter to human nature? Why else would benevolent men be so full of sorrow?

Consider the man with webbed toes—when they are severed, he weeps. The man with an extra finger—when it is bitten off, he wails. Both cases, whether in excess or deficiency of number, share the same sorrow. Now, the benevolent of this world gaze in distress at the world’s afflictions, while the unbenevolent sever their nature’s bonds to glut themselves on wealth and rank. Thus, is it not that benevolence and righteousness run counter to human nature?

Since the Three Dynasties and beyond, why has the world been so clamorous? Those who rely on hooks, cords, compasses, and squares to achieve correctness carve away their nature. Those who depend on ropes, glue, and lacquer to secure firmness encroach upon their virtue. Bending and twisting with rites and music, sacrificing to the praise of benevolence and righteousness to console the world’s hearts—this is to lose what is constant.

The world has its constancy. What is constant? The crooked need no hook, the straight no cord, the round no compass, the square no square. Adhesion requires no glue or lacquer; binding needs no rope. Thus, the world arises in harmonious spontaneity, unaware of how it arises; all attain in unison, unaware of how they attain. From ancient times to the present, this has never changed—it cannot be diminished.

Then why do benevolence and righteousness cling like glue, lacquer, and knotted cords, weaving through the space of Dao and virtue? They only serve to delude the world!

Minor delusions distort direction; great delusions distort nature. How do we know this is so? Ever since the time of Yu, when benevolence and righteousness were summoned to disturb the world, all have rushed to answer the call of benevolence and righteousness—is this not to exchange one’s nature for benevolence and righteousness?

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
Benevolence and righteousness are inherently part of human nature and should both be allowed their course. To fear that benevolence and righteousness are not of human nature and thus fret over them—this is truly excessive sorrow. The man with webbed toes, being deficient, weeps when they are cut; the man with an extra finger, being in excess, wails when it is gnawed. If all things vary in form and number, there will be no end to sorrow. Only when each abides in its natural state, bending to accommodate without harm, is there no cause for grief!

Yet when the path of universal love is exalted, the world’s eyes grow confused. To advance what is exalted, then lament its failure to bring rest—this is to cast people into peril and then rescue them. And yet, the governance of this age deems this benevolence.

If no such exalted path existed, people would rest content in their lot. How then would they imitate others, coveting what is not theirs? All things have their constancy. Left to themselves without interference, all attain in unison without self-awareness. Thus, they remain undivided from things and ever whole. Following the Dao, they attain spontaneously, embracing simplicity and walking alone, untangled by external things.

Benevolence and righteousness, clinging without end, only serve to delude and cause beings to lose their truth. To mistake east for west harms not the body, but to pride oneself on benevolence and exalt righteousness is to lose one’s constancy and court destruction—this is the greatest delusion.

To act without harming things is not to perform benevolence, yet benevolence naturally arises. All principles are fitting, not for the sake of righteousness, yet righteousness manifests. When fitting yet unharmful, the world does not rush toward benevolence and righteousness. To abandon oneself and follow others is to lose one’s constancy. Thus, the heart’s disorder does not arise from ugliness but ever dwells in beauty; the world’s disturbance does not stem from evil but ever lies in benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, benevolence and righteousness are the very tools that disturb the world.

Is this not to exchange one’s nature for benevolence and righteousness? Though Yu did not intend to alter nature, the world’s nature was already changed!

**Lü’s Commentary:**
Benevolence and righteousness are arrayed among the five virtues, yet the greatest benevolence is not benevolent, and the utmost righteousness is not righteous. How then are they not of human nature? Only when they are pursued to excess, not following the true course of Dao and virtue, does one suspect they are not of human nature. The benevolent man’s many sorrows arise from this excess.

Webbed toes and extra fingers, whether in excess or deficiency of number, share the same sorrow when removed. The benevolent of this age, gazing in distress at the world’s ills, resemble those in excess; the unbenevolent, who sever their nature to glut themselves on wealth and rank, resemble those in deficiency. Yet none recognize that this is not the true disposition of nature and cling to it, weeping when cut or wailing when gnawed.

To rely on compasses, cords, glue, and lacquer for correctness and firmness is to carve away one’s nature and encroach upon one’s virtue, losing what is constant. What is constant? It requires no compass, cord, glue, or lacquer to be naturally correct and firm. It arises and attains without knowing how, ancient yet uncorrupted, present yet unrenewed—this is the constancy of Dao and virtue’s true course.

Then why do benevolence and righteousness cling like glue, lacquer, and knotted cords, weaving through their midst to delude the world? To mistake direction is to take east for west; to alter nature is to take nothing for something. Human beings are tranquil at birth, yet benevolence and righteousness are summoned to disturb them—is this not to exchange one’s nature for benevolence and righteousness?

**Yi Du’s Commentary:**
Benevolence and righteousness arise from human nature. Now, to pluck virtue and block nature in the name of benevolence and righteousness is not spontaneous. Thus, Zhuangzi suspects they are not of human nature. Otherwise, why would the benevolence of Zeng and Shi be so full of sorrow?

The ancients practiced benevolence and righteousness by expanding their innate nature. Later ages, however, followed only the periphery of benevolence and righteousness, falling into artificiality and pretense. Thus, all one sees is their excessive sorrow.

If one does not follow the heavenly Dao, taking webbed toes and extra fingers as afflictions of human nature and seeking to harm and remove them, one will only weep and wail in grief. The analogy of webbed toes and extra fingers to benevolence and righteousness is apt, for if one truly fathoms their root, they are one with nature and cannot be removed. Yet failing to do so and merely following their path, others, seeing their advance, will seek to cast them off.

This is the cause of sorrow. The benevolent of this age gaze in distress at the world, and when the heart is troubled, the eyes become disordered. For all things, following their natural course brings peace, while harming their nature and life brings sorrow. Webbed toes, too, are a natural part of one’s nature; to cut and remove them is like the benevolent who, grieving over the world’s ills, seek to remedy them—only compounding their sorrow. The unbenevolent, however, rend the true essence of their nature and life to glut themselves on wealth and rank. This stems from the excesses of benevolence and righteousness, which, when overemphasized, become false—hence the doubt that benevolence and righteousness are not true to human nature.

Since the Three Dynasties, simplicity has scattered and cannot be restored—how clamorous it has become! To rely on hooks, strings, compasses, and squares for correction is not the natural way of rectitude; it is called carving away one’s nature. To depend on cords, glue, and lacquer for firmness is not the natural way of stability; it is called encroaching upon one’s virtue. Bending and yielding are but the remnants of ritual and music. Pursuing compliance is the advancement of benevolence and righteousness. To use these to console the hearts of the world is to lose what is naturally constant. What is constant in the world—does it require anything to be correct and firm? Not knowing how it lives, it lives of itself; not knowing how it attains, it attains of itself. Thus it harmonizes past and present, equalizes life and death, and nothing can harm or diminish it!

Then why must the paths of benevolence and righteousness be ceaselessly strung together, like glue and lacquer, like bound ropes, drifting between the Dao and virtue? This speaks of how the followers of Zeng and Shi cannot roam the Dao and virtue with an empty mind, but are instead bound by benevolence and righteousness, unable to break free. Why do the people of the world vie to admire the name of benevolence and righteousness, only to confuse their hearts?

Changing direction is easy to awaken from; altering one’s nature leads to delusion without return—this is the distinction between small and great. Zeng and Shi merely followed the traces of benevolence and righteousness, so they may be criticized. Yet even the benevolence and righteousness of Youyu, which fulfilled his nature—why did Zhuangzi still criticize them? It is because he reproached them for their beginning, which could not but be so. Moreover, the former kings employed benevolence and righteousness to perfect the people’s nature and return them to the Dao. Later ages, however, took their leftover threads and revered their teachings, believing that the utmost of Heaven’s mandate lay therein. Grasping what was meant to perfect nature, they took it as nature itself—how could they abandon its name and delight in its reality?

What is rejected is Youyu’s teachings; what is preserved is Youyu’s heart. The *Classic* says: "Receiving the mandate from Heaven, only Shun was truly upright." This refers to preserving his heart. The *Bixu Commentary* states: "Forcing and shaping are the carving of nature; contriving and conforming are the encroachment upon virtue." These all lose what is naturally constant. The crookedness or straightness of fleabane and hemp—which requires hooks and strings? The roundness or squareness of pearls and jade—which requires compasses and squares? The intertwining of pines and creepers—which requires glue and lacquer? The joining of paired branches and twin ears—which requires bound ropes? The materials of things and their heavenly nature all arise from the natural. Thus, all things grow spontaneously, all attain spontaneously, past and present are as one, without rise or fall.

To align with the Dao and virtue yet rush toward benevolence and righteousness is to change direction; to pursue profit and fame while harming life is to alter one’s nature. Ever since Youyu promoted the worthy, banished the wicked, and summoned benevolence and righteousness to sway the world, the world has had none who do not hasten to lose their lives thereby—this is the delusion of great confusion. The *Yongzhai Oral Teachings* say: "Webbed toes, though an affliction of the hands and feet, cannot be forcibly removed; forcing their removal brings sorrow and suffering." "Gazing in distress" means half-closing the eyes, their lashes bristling, conveying the sense of sitting alone in sorrow. Grieving over the world and exhausting oneself, coveting wealth and rank—these are all self-inflicted torments, hence they are spoken of together.

To doubt that benevolence and righteousness are not of human nature is to say they do not arise from what is naturally so. Since the Three Dynasties, this view has flourished—how noisy it has become! The virtue of one’s nature arises from the natural, not from human effort. If one must rely on cultivation to be correct, this is self-mutilation. Hooks, strings, glue, and lacquer are all metaphors for cultivation. Thus, bending and yielding to console the world all lose what is naturally constant. Yet the crooked and straight, round and square, requiring no human effort, are the true principles.

"Spontaneously" is akin to "weeds." What causes weeds to grow? What grants things their commonality? Not knowing how they grow, not knowing how they attain—thus past and present are as one, without addition or loss. "Ceaselessly" describes unending action. Glue and lacquer bind of themselves; bound ropes constrain of themselves. To depart from nature in pursuit of benevolence and righteousness, endlessly engaging in it, is to become mired and bound—how can one then roam between the Dao and virtue? It only deludes the world.

Minor delusion inverts the four directions; great delusion alters the nature of Heaven and Earth! Establishing the name of benevolence and righteousness to sway the world, the world is driven by it and rushes toward it, knowing benevolence and righteousness but not the Dao and virtue—this is to exchange one’s nature for external things. Benevolence and righteousness arise from human nature and emotions; those who lack them counterfeit them. Webbed toes arise from the body; those burdened by them despise them.

The *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi], seeing that the world exalts benevolence and righteousness, abandons the self to imitate others, pursues the path while forgetting the root, thus laments: "Are benevolence and righteousness not of human nature?" It means that forcing one’s nature to act thus does not arise from ease, but gathers the world’s sighs to become one’s own sorrow. Fearing the world’s disorder, one rushes to remedy it yet cannot prevail. Gazing in distress, hearts scorched with worry—is this not like cutting and removing webbed toes? Those unbenevolent ones rend their nature and life without regard, glutting themselves on wealth and rank without cease. When their calamity strikes, they are undone, losing both themselves and their possessions before stopping.

Where there is the true of benevolence and righteousness in nature, there must also be the false that counterfeits it. How detestable are those who, like birds of prey, use these vessels to oppress the people of the world—hence the repeated lament: "Are benevolence and righteousness not of human nature?"

Since the Three Dynasties, those who practice benevolence and righteousness—how hollow and frivolous they have become! The fundamental nature of things is upright and firm, arising from spontaneity. That which requires external correction is not perfectly upright; that which depends on reinforcement is not truly firm. Thus, to pare away one’s nature and encroach upon virtue is to lose what is constant and natural—no different from the webbed toes of hands and feet.

What is constant and natural takes its own form—curved or straight, square or round—without need of compass or carpenter’s square. Self-arising and self-attained, it knows no distinction between ancient and modern, no difference between completion and loss. When the Dao and virtue are perfectly blended, benevolence and righteousness become superfluous. Why then do men cling so stubbornly to their advancement, deluding the world?

Minor delusion confuses directions, misplacing east and west—yet this does little harm. But great delusion alters one’s nature, losing what is constant and natural, rebelling against the Dao and betraying virtue. The harm it brings cannot be fully described! Yet this malady has long seeped deep, ever since the time of Youyu, who summoned the Seven Virtues to disturb the world, imposing benevolence and righteousness to replace natural nature. When nature is no longer true, benevolence and righteousness become false as well. Still, the world rushes to obey, content in the loss of its nature, never awakening—this is what the true person laments.

Let us examine this: since the Three Dynasties, the world has bartered its nature for things without exception. The petty man sacrifices himself for profit; the scholar, for fame; the grandee, for his family; the sage, for the world. Though their undertakings differ and their reputations vary, they are one in harming their nature to serve external ends.

Zang and Gu, two men herding sheep together, both lost their flock. Asked what Zang was doing, he held a bamboo slip and read; asked what Gu was doing, he played at dice. Though their pursuits differed, their loss of sheep was the same. Boyi died for fame beneath Shouyang Mountain, while Robber Zhi died for profit atop Dongling. Though their deaths differed, they were equal in maiming life and harming nature. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? The world is wholly given to sacrifice. Those who sacrifice for benevolence and righteousness are called gentlemen by custom...

Those who sacrifice for wealth and property are called petty men by custom. Yet their sacrifice is the same—some are deemed gentlemen, some petty men. But if we consider their maiming of life and harm to nature, then Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi. How then can we distinguish between gentleman and petty man?

Guo’s Commentary: Before the Three Dynasties, there were indeed traces of non-action, which later men of action revered. Yet in revering them, they lost their natural state. Even sages had no choice but to exchange the ease of inaction for the scars of action. The quail nests in the wild and eats from the cart’s grain; the crow flies without pattern—where do they not sacrifice? Thus, one who constantly merges with the world adapts to its changes, yet this very adaptation is a sacrifice to the world’s paths. What one encounters may at times bring scars, baldness, or the changes of scripture, and in advancing, one harms the world’s paths. Yet if one roams the eight directions with spirit and qi unchanged, or bears scars on hands and feet without disturbance to one’s form, then where is the sacrifice? There is none. Yet though one does not sacrifice what one ought not, one’s traces still conform to the world’s sacrifices.

What the world cherishes is life. Now, if one sacrifices it excessively, maiming life in all cases, then the right or wrong of what is sacrificed is no longer worth discussing. Why is life maimed? Why is nature altered? All stems from revering the legacy of non-action! If one knows that advancement is achieved through non-action, then one severs excessive reverence, removes extremes, and returns to merging with the ultimate.

Yao and Jie were equal in self-contentment; how then distinguish between gentleman and petty man?

Lü’s Commentary: The spirit descends to become the sage, while the king is but the sage’s outward form. From the Three Dynasties onward, all have followed the legacy of sage-kings, and what made them spirit has vanished from sight. Even Yu’s calloused hands, Tang and Wu’s campaigns—though born of necessity—could not escape sacrificing to the world’s ills. Zhuangzi sought to sever such advancement and return to the original source of the spirit’s heaven. Thus, his critique of the sage is fitting, not a belittlement.

The male slave who marries a maidservant is called Zang; the female slave who marries a male servant is called Gu. Herding sheep is a metaphor for guarding the mind, and guarding the mind is how one nurtures the heart. One who reads with a bamboo slip may do no wrong yet cannot avoid being matched with wrong; one who gambles in idleness may be dissolute and unprincipled, yet what emerges from them is principled. Both harm the guarding of the mind. Though their pursuits differ, their loss of sheep is the same. Boyi died for fame, which is the metaphor of reading with a bamboo slip and losing the sheep; Robber Zhi died for profit, which is the metaphor of gambling and losing the sheep. Though their deaths differed, they were equal in maiming life and harming nature. This is why those who embody the Way value forgetting both and transforming through the Dao.

Moreover, the world is wholly given to sacrifice. Those who sacrifice for benevolence and righteousness do not realize that their person is closer than fame; those who sacrifice for wealth and property do not realize that their person is greater than property. Their sacrifice is the same—some are called gentlemen, some petty men. Yet in maiming life and harming nature, Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi. They do not know that the affliction of gain is equal to the affliction of loss.

Du’s Commentary: Boyi died for the fame of purity; Robber Zhi died for the profit of greed. Neither knew whether fame or life was closer, whether life or property was greater. What they pursued was but the dust and husks of externals! Boyi’s fame endures on Shouyang Mountain, but where is Boyi’s person? Robber Zhi’s wealth accumulated on Dongling, but where is Robber Zhi’s spirit? Thus it is said: in maiming life and harming nature, they were equal. If so, why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? This is the oneness of the Dao.

Boyi was the sage of purity, yet Zhuangzi harshly criticized him because his traces were visible in the world and set in opposition to Robber Zhi. Thus, Zhuangzi spoke this to correct the contemporary flaw of emulating Boyi—those who rigidly uphold conduct and revere action. Though Boyi’s fame was set in opposition to Robber Zhi’s, his spirit wandered with Confucius, and scholars must not be unaware of this.

The world is wholly given to sacrifice. If one does not sacrifice for benevolence and righteousness to seek fame, then one must sacrifice for wealth and property to satisfy desire. The great governance of the world does not depart from the realm of profit and fame. Those who sacrifice for benevolence and righteousness are called gentlemen by custom, yet they do not know they are Heaven’s petty men. Those who sacrifice for wealth and property are called petty men by custom, yet they do not know they are equal to the world’s so-called gentlemen.

Those who sacrifice for benevolence and righteousness diminish their allotted share to augment their nature; those who sacrifice for wealth and property diminish their nature to augment their allotted share. If both can settle into the natural state of their nature and destiny, then Heaven’s gentlemen are not the world’s gentlemen, and the world’s petty men are what the classics call petty men.

Detailed Daoist Commentary: Before the Three Dynasties, the world exchanged its nature for transformation through righteousness; after the Three Dynasties, the world exchanged its nature for things. The longer the world endures, the more its simplicity scatters. Boyi died for fame, for he could not weaken his resolve; Robber Zhi died for profit, for he could not strengthen his bones.

Zang represents the goodness of righteousness; Gu represents the goodness of trustworthiness. A male slave who marries a maidservant is called Zang; a female slave who marries a male servant is called Gu. Men value righteousness; women value trustworthiness—thus it is. The sheep is a creature that is docile yet not partisan, reverent yet observant of ritual. Its nature is never not good. The creators of characters took *yang* (sheep) with *yan* (speech) to form *shan* (goodness), and *yang* with *da* (great) to form *mei* (beauty). Thus, Zhuangzi’s use of the lost sheep as a metaphor for lost virtue is fitting. Zang and Gu differed in restraint and indulgence, yet were equal in losing their sheep; Boyi and Robber Zhi differed in goodness and evil, yet were equal in maiming life.

How then can one distinguish between the gentleman and the petty man? The *Bixu* commentary states: "Where there is pursuit, there is compliance." Once fame and reputation become manifest, advancement cannot be evaded. Zang and Gu lost their sheep—this is minor confusion leading to the loss of direction. Boyi and Robber Zhi maimed life—this is great confusion leading to the loss of nature. If all under Heaven pursue [external things], then even Robber Zhi becomes a Boyi. What distinction remains between gentleman and petty man?

*Yongzhai* observes: "To speak of the realm, the state, fame, and profit in the same breath is to diminish the great by the small, to debase the high by the low—this is the general tendency of the text." The deeds of these several men differ, yet their maiming of life is one; their studies and diversions differ, yet their loss of the sheep is equal. All are errors of compliance with things.

Did Zhuangzi not know the worthiness or baseness of Boyi and Robber Zhi? His intent was to satirize the gentleman, and so he borrowed the petty man to illustrate it—this too is the intent to debase the high by the low. In high antiquity, simplicity and sincerity prevailed; the customs of the people were harmonious. They required no governance yet governed themselves, and thus the people rested in the naturalness of their allotted nature, while the ruler achieved transformation through dignified inaction.

From the Three Dynasties onward, nature was exchanged for things; the pursuit of artifice led to the loss of authenticity. Though the worthy and foolish, the noble and base differed, each took what they pursued to be right and did not perceive their distance from the Dao. Thus, their maiming of life and injury to nature were no different. Thereafter, those who ruled over the people established punishments, policies, rewards, and penalties to guide, regulate, encourage, and restrain them. Yet when both high and low grew weary, deceit and treachery arose. When punishments, policies, rewards, and penalties could no longer control them, the people ceased to be their people, and the state ceased to be their state. This truly originates in the mutual compliance of high and low, leading to the failure of both ruler and people.

The metaphor of Zang and Gu losing their sheep is most apt. Moreover, if all under Heaven pursue [external things], all lose their original Heaven-endowed nature and become mired in one-sided views. They even condemn those who do not comply—what distinction remains between gentleman and petty man? Boyi’s purity and Robber Zhi’s filth are as distinct as black and white to later ages. Yet the Master of the Mulberry Orchard blends them as one. In terms of what they pursued, none could avoid compliance; even the sage cannot escape judgment—how much less Robber Zhi?

The governance of the realm under Heaven is like a balance: to depress one side is to elevate the other, for the circumstances admit no alternative. Only by seeking equilibrium can harmony be achieved. If all under Heaven ceased compliance and avoided the maiming of life and injury to nature, then surely a distinction would exist between the sage and Robber Zhi! Yet the grounds of their goodness or evil must be observed from beyond the confines of benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom.

**Outer Chapters: "Parallel Limbs," Chapter Three**

Moreover, those who bind their nature to benevolence and righteousness—though as discerning as Zengzi or Shi Yu—are not what I call *good*. Those who bind their nature to the five flavors—though as discerning as Yu Er—are not what I call *good*. Those who bind their nature to the five tones—though as discerning as Music Master Kuang—are not what I call *keen*. Those who bind their nature to the five colors—though as discerning as Li Zhu—are not what I call *clear-sighted*.

What I call *good* is not a matter of benevolence and righteousness, but of treasuring one’s own *power* alone. What I call *good* is not a matter of benevolence and righteousness, but of following the natural dispositions of one’s nature and fate. What I call *keen* is not a matter of hearing others, but of hearing oneself. What I call *clear-sighted* is not a matter of seeing others, but of seeing oneself.

Those who do not see themselves but see others, who do not attain themselves but attain others—these are people who grasp others’ attainments without attaining their own, who follow others’ satisfactions without satisfying themselves. Those who follow others’ satisfactions without satisfying themselves—whether Robber Zhi or Bo Yi—are equally given to excess and perversion.

I am ashamed before the *Dao* and *virtue*, and thus above I dare not cling to the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, while below I dare not engage in excess and perversion.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
Binding one’s nature to benevolence is merely following benevolence; only by letting nature flow freely through the five flavors can one be truly good. If one does not entrust it to oneself but binds it to others—however discerning those others may be—one has already lost oneself. Each should employ their ears and eyes without being constrained by Li Zhu or Music Master Kuang; only then is one truly keen and clear-sighted.

Thus, those who excel in self-attainment forget benevolence and are transformed. To regard benevolence and righteousness as good and harm oneself in pursuit of them is to act contrary to one’s nature and fate, even to the point of self-injury. If one’s own person is not humane, what can one do for others? Only by following one’s nature and fate can one benefit others without burdening oneself, aligning with self-attainment—this may be called good.

To sever oneself from Li Zhu and Music Master Kuang and rely solely on one’s own hearing and seeing is to preserve the keenness and clarity of all things. Those who do not see themselves but see others, who do not attain themselves but attain others, abandon themselves to imitate others. In imitating others, one has already perished. Though their paths of loss may differ, the loss is the same. Thus, ashamed before the *Dao* and *virtue*, I do not act, decline progress in obscurity, sever myself from conduct and fame, forget profit and loss, move freely amidst entanglements, and leave behind both self and others—this is all.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
Nature is what things belong to; it does not belong to things. Yet Zengzi and Shi Yu belong to benevolence, Yu Er to flavors, Music Master Kuang and Li Zhu to tones and colors—these are not what I call *good*. Treasuring one’s *power* is the essence of *good*; it is not that benevolence and righteousness can make one good, but that one follows the natural dispositions of one’s nature and fate.

To speak of benevolence and righteousness is to impose a label, and what is treasured remains uncertain. To follow the natural dispositions of one’s nature and fate is to be without labels and beyond naming—this is true *good*. The same applies to keenness and clarity: not hearing others but hearing oneself, not seeing others but seeing oneself—this is called seeing what is to be seen and hearing what is to be heard. If one’s seeing and hearing lie in others rather than oneself, one grasps others’ attainments, follows others’ satisfactions, and fails to attain one’s own nature and fate or satisfy oneself. Then Robber Zhi and Bo Yi—what difference is there between them? Both deviate from the true *Dao* and *virtue*.

Above, one does not act for the *Dao*; below, one does not act perversely—thus both are forgotten. Bo Yi was a sage, yet how could one who does not attain and satisfy himself be a sage? If he sought to rectify the stubborn and strengthen the weak through his conduct, he could not avoid acting. Zhuangzi speaks of the natural dispositions of nature and fate to forget both fame and profit, hence equating Bo Yi and Robber Zhi as excess and perversion. Yet when discussing lofty integrity and defiant conduct sufficient to correct the world, Bo Yi and Shu Qi’s integrity is ranked alongside Xu You, Shan Ju, Confucius, and Yan He in the *"Abdication of Kings"*—this is perplexing.

**Yi’s Commentary:**
*Binding* means nature is attached to something, not universally aligned with things without partiality. Thus, Zengzi, Shi Yu, Yu Er, Music Master Kuang, and Li Zhu—each bound to benevolence, flavors, tones, and colors—cannot avoid following external things, and are not what I call *good*. Treasuring one’s *power* means following the natural dispositions of one’s nature and fate. These natural dispositions—true nature, true flavor, true color, true tone—are what all things inherently possess, yet those individuals force them, failing to attain or satisfy themselves.

Only by being true to one’s nature can one avoid binding it to things, and then true flavors, tones, and colors become apparent. Containing one’s keenness leads to inward listening; containing one’s clarity leads to inner vision. Inward listening brings one to hear the *Dao*; inner vision brings one to see the *Dao*. When the *Dao* is attained, one’s nature is attained.

Those who do not see themselves but see others have lost themselves in chasing things. Those who do not attain themselves but attain others have strayed from their nature in seeking the *Dao*. Though Bo Yi and Robber Zhi differ, their excess and perversion are the same. Thus, one knows that hypocrisy and righteousness lead to the loss of the *Dao*, while excess and perversion disrupt *virtue*—both are what Zhuangzi does not do.

**Xiang’s Commentary:**
Where there is sound, there is true sound; where there is color, there is true color; where there is flavor, there is true flavor. The sounds that are sounded are heard, yet the true sounds have never been uttered. The colors that are colored are manifest, yet the true colors have never been displayed. The flavors that are tasted are known, yet the true flavors have never been presented.

The ears and eyes of humans are originally empty and still. When sounds and colors appear before them, the true is lost amid the false; the same applies to flavors. *Laozi* says: "The five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deafen the ears; the five flavors dull the palate." How much worse is it to multiply branches and bind one’s nature to them?

**Bixu’s Commentary:**
Zeng, Shi, Yu the Elder, Shi Kuang, and Li Zhu were all biased toward a single ability, enslaving their natures to external things and losing their celestial authenticity—how could this be called goodness? Those who treasure virtue regard self-attainment as goodness, following the natural inclinations of their nature and destiny, hearing and seeing for themselves alone. To seek what others seek or conform to what others conform to is to lose oneself to external things.

Thus, the superior do not dare to practice the seven virtues, nor the inferior to indulge in perverse excesses—this is how one nurtures the uprightness of nature and the correctness of destiny. *Yongzhai* says: To follow the natural inclinations of one’s nature and destiny is to accord with spontaneity. The discourse on hearing and seeing for oneself alone is its unique and unmatched insight. The entirety of the *Great Treasury* teachings does not surpass this meaning. Self-attainment and self-conformity are self-seeing and self-awakening.

Generally, to distinguish the original mind from external things, yet fail to grasp the original mind and instead chase after externals, is all perverse excess. The superior do not dare to cling to the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, nor the inferior to engage in perverse and deviant acts—doing good without approaching fame, doing evil without approaching punishment. The Dao/Way and virtue/power are spontaneity itself; to approach fame or punishment is to depart from spontaneity.

Observing Zhuangzi’s words here, how could he not be rectifying the mind and cultivating the person? His criticisms of Yao, Shun, Confucius, Zeng, Shi, and Boyi are not substantive arguments but merely the flourishes of his brush. If one’s nature is like the great void, exhausting it yields nothing, yet it is nowhere absent. Once it becomes attached to something, it falls into partiality and bias, no longer the uprightness of the Dao/Way and virtue/power.

Though Zeng, Shi, Li, and Kuang were endowed with exceptional qi, excelling in their particular strengths, from the perspective of the Dao/Way, they were still not free from perverse excess. How much worse is it to exalt others’ strengths while belittling their own, so that few avoid learning the steps of Deng Zhu! Thus, none of them can be considered truly good. True goodness lies in following the natural inclinations of one’s nature and destiny, emerging from the uprightness of the Dao/Way and virtue/power, without the faults of forced striving or partiality.

The ears, eyes, and mouth, in relation to sounds, colors, and flavors, neither forcibly penetrate nor forcibly resist, but follow their spontaneity without harboring private inclinations—this is the utmost correctness under heaven, and what external thing could disturb it? When one’s intelligence and clarity reach the point of hearing and seeing for oneself, it differs from the worldly intelligence and clarity. When one’s goodness lies in self-attainment and self-conformity, it differs from what the world calls goodness.

When benevolence and righteousness depart, the true nature is preserved—this is treasuring one’s virtue/power. Virtue/power resides within, and the Dao/Way comes to harmonize with it; how could external things find their way in? If one does not attain and conform to oneself but instead conforms to others, then it is all perverse excess. What distinction remains between the worthy and the unworthy?

The *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi] claims it does not dare to act either above or below but rests in the self-attainment of nature and destiny—this is the uprightness of the Dao/Way and virtue/power. The *Inner Chapters* of this classic were titled by the Master of Qi Garden [Zhuangzi], each with profound meaning. The *Outer* and *Miscellaneous Chapters* were edited and revised by Guo Xiang, who merely took the first characters of each chapter as their titles, though their essential meanings remain.

Since the *Inner Chapters* elaborate on the principles of the Dao/Way, virtue/power, nature, and destiny, the *Outer Chapters* begin by discussing what virtue/power and nature ought not to possess—like superfluous branches and tumors on the body. I humbly suggest that the original intent of this chapter derives from the *Daodejing*’s "leftover food and redundant conduct," illustrating how those who see and pride themselves on their own abilities are far from the Dao/Way. Yet the *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi] expounds upon this with such vast and flowing eloquence, for to propagate the Dao/Way and elucidate its teachings, one cannot but exhaust words to convey its meaning, dispelling the world’s delusions and guiding it back to spontaneity and harmony with the Dao/Way.

A person’s virtue/power is pure like jade within uncut stone. As it is gradually nourished, it shines like wood and illumines like mountains. But when carved by intelligence or divided by the seven virtues, seeking goodness in external things, one’s innate simplicity is lost. Thus, he cites Zeng, Shi, Li, Kuang, Yang, and Mo—those who grasped only a partial aspect of their nature and followed perverse habits—as examples of the "superfluous branches" of the Dao/Way. Yet the world still rushes to admire them, losing the natural inclinations of their nature and destiny and departing from the uprightness of the Dao/Way and virtue/power—this is how the world is thrown into chaos.

Only by forgetting their differences and unifying them, like the hare and the crane, which have no need for interruption or continuity yet each loses nothing of its spontaneity, can one approach the Dao/Way. Yet if the world is all deluded, what can I do? Thus, he sets forth the parable of Zang and Gu losing their sheep to illustrate how Boyi and Robber Zhi each took their own biases as the distinction between gentleman and petty man, though both harm life and injure nature in the same way.

If one truly can abandon traces and cease esteeming, so that one’s nature has no attachments, return to the root and merge with the ultimate, and wander in the origin of things, then superfluous branches and tumors will be forgotten along with the body. Gentlemen and petty men alike will attain self-possession, and thus the ultimate lies in following the natural inclinations of nature and destiny, while one’s original intelligence and clarity remain undiminished.

Not hearing others but hearing for oneself, not seeing others but seeing for oneself—this aligns with what Yanzi called "the benevolent loving themselves, the wise knowing themselves." Thus, self-attainment and self-conformity leave no room for envy or longing, and the distinctions between the worthiness of Yi and the baseness of Pi will become clear.

The twenty-sixth fascicle of *The Ocean of Subtleties in the Meaning of the True Classic of Nanhua* begins.

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin comments on "The Horse’s Hooves" (Chapter One):

Horses’ hooves can tread frost and snow, their coats can ward off wind and cold; they graze on grass and drink from streams, lift their hooves and gallop across the land—this is the true nature of horses. Even if there were halls of righteousness and royal chambers, they would have no use for them.

Yet when Bo Le arrived, he declared, “I am skilled in managing horses.” He branded them, pared them, carved them, and pierced them; he bound them with halters and hobbles, penned them in blackened stalls—and thus twelve or thirteen out of every hundred horses perished. He starved them, parched them, galloped them, raced them, drilled them, and aligned them; ahead lay the peril of ornamental trappings, behind the threat of whips and scorn—and thus more than half the horses died.

The potter says, “I am skilled in shaping clay: round vessels meet the compass, square ones meet the carpenter’s square.” The craftsman says, “I am skilled in working wood: curved pieces fit the hook, straight ones align with the marking line.” But do the nature of clay and wood truly desire to conform to compass, square, hook, and line?

Yet generation after generation, people praise Bo Le for his skill in managing horses, and potters and craftsmen for their skill in shaping clay and wood—this is also the error of those who govern the world.

Guo’s commentary: Whether a horse is slow or swift, each is sufficient in its own nature; it does not reject the saddle out of hatred for riding, but merely does not covet splendor. When one deliberately seeks to manage it, one fails to manage it. What is called “good management” is in fact the beginning of harm. Those who excel in driving horses aim to exhaust their abilities, yet exhausting ability lies in allowing them to act on their own. Instead, they force them into rapid strides, seeking performance beyond their capacity—hence many cannot endure and perish. If one were to rely on the strength of slow and swift horses alike, adapting to their natural pace, then even if their tracks reached the farthest corners of the earth, the nature of all horses would remain intact.

Some, hearing of allowing horses to follow their nature, claim this means letting them roam untethered; hearing of the wind of non-action, they say inaction is inferior to external effort—how reckless and unreturning! The world deems those who follow nature without artifice as poor managers, while those who use compass and square to distort nature until death are called skilled—is this not a grave error?

Lü’s commentary: When horses graze and drink without coveting halls of righteousness or royal chambers, it is like farmers and weavers being self-sufficient without yearning for lofty positions. Bo Le’s branding, paring, carving, and piercing of horses—causing twelve or thirteen out of a hundred to die—is like forcing benevolence and righteousness upon the world, sowing the first seeds of doubt. Starving, parching, galloping, and racing them until more than half die is like bending and breaking ritual and music, causing the world to fracture. The world has its constant nature; one should act according to it. Yet potters and craftsmen, in their skill at shaping round, square, curved, and straight forms, all violate this constant nature. To govern the world while violating its constant nature is to fail to understand the Dao of “letting be” and thus err in governance.

Yi Du’s commentary: The true nature of horses is to roam freely in the wilds without coveting halls of righteousness or royal chambers. Yet when Bo Le arrives, he brands, pares, carves, and pierces them, and twelve or thirteen out of a hundred horses die; he starves, parches, gallops, and races them, and more than half perish. All this is due to exalting artificiality and rigidifying true nature. Potters and craftsmen shape clay and wood to meet compass, square, hook, and line—but is this what clay and wood desire? The sage’s governance of the world through benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music is no different. Yet the world praises Bo Le for his skill in managing horses, craftsmen for their skill in shaping clay and wood, and sages for their skill in governing the world—all because the great Dao has scattered, the wholeness of heaven and earth is no longer seen, and only the governance of people is lauded. This is why Zhuangzi so deeply condemns it.

Xiang Dao’s commentary: Earth has form but no life, wood has life but no awareness, horses have awareness but no sense of duty—though these three differ, those who excel in managing them all follow their nature without violating their spontaneity, adhere to their principles without imposing force. Thus, horses exhaust their abilities, and clay and wood fulfill their uses. How could those who excel in governing the world be any different?

Bi Xu’s commentary: The knowledge of horses extends only to grazing, drinking, and galloping across the land. Having no use for halls of righteousness or royal chambers is like the marsh pheasant’s refusal to be caged. Yet when Bo Le begins to manage them, their nature is already harmed; their strength cannot bear the burden, and more than half die. Earth has its round and square forms, so potters apply compass and square; wood has its curved and straight grains, so craftsmen use hook and line; horses have their slow and swift natures, so Bo Le wields whips and scorn; people have their worthy and foolish natures, so sages establish laws and standards—all are responses to their inherent qualities. Those who later drive horses to ruin do not possess Bo Le’s talent; those who govern the people and fail do not follow the sage’s Dao. Yet they blame Bo Le and the sages—this is to misunderstand true skill, which is why Zhuangzi laments.

Yongzhai’s note: *Yi tai* and *lu qin* are the dwellings of kings. An alternate reading is *Xi tai*, meaning “nurturing,” for environment transforms qi, and nurture transforms the body. Burning, paring, carving, and scraping are all forms of management. *Zhui* refers to bridling the head.

The term *bi* refers to hobbling the feet; *lian* means "to arrange in order"; *gen* is the bit; *shi* encompasses trappings like reins and tassels. Horses are controlled by humans and cannot follow their own nature, which is why so many perish. Potters and carpenters shape clay and wood into vessels—no different from horses subjected to burning, paring, carving, and bridling. Yet people praise Bo Le and craftsmen as skilled, just as those below the era of Tai Shi extol rulers for governing the world. All things possess inherent natures, and people possess inherent virtues; when virtue remains unsevered, human nature is preserved. Why then pursue excessive demands and overindulgence, harming virtue and injuring nature?

The True Person laments that in this degenerate age, humanity destroys Heaven’s endowment, refusing to abide by its original allotment while seeking knowledge beyond its proper bounds. From rulers governing subjects to subjects serving rulers, all are ensnared in the web of cunning and defense. As knowledge proliferates, the hearts of the unworthy respond in kind—even severe punishments and harsh laws cannot restrain them. The root of this disorder lies in the rulers’ excessive love of knowledge, which sparks a thirst for it and then imposes it through instruction. Is this not laborious and meddlesome? To rectify the source and purify the origin, to eradicate these ills, the text uses the horse as a metaphor to expose the failures of governance, hoping that those entrusted with the Way of rule may take heed.

Since the Three Dynasties, human nature has strayed, and the establishment of punishments, policies, rewards, and penalties—these four are the reins, trappings, whips, and scorn of governing the world. Yet the sprouts of cunning and deceit arise precisely from this. The later passage speaks of those who "steal even the wisdom of sages"—this is the same flaw.

What then should today’s rulers do? They should prioritize the Dao and virtue, with the four measures as auxiliaries—this would suffice. To abandon the Dao and virtue while relying solely on punishments and policies is no different from Bo Le’s treatment of horses. Though swift steeds may distinguish themselves, the harm suffered by horses is not slight. If one neither embraces the Dao nor employs the four measures, not even a single household can be ordered—how then could the world be governed? The analogy of the potter’s kiln does not depart from the earlier meaning; the fault lies with us.

The phrase "skillful governance" betrays self-congratulation and a deliberate effort to impose order—how can this restore human nature and preserve inherent virtue? Thus, the text says: *This is the error of those who govern the world.* My view is that those who truly govern well do not act thus. People possess inherent natures: they weave to clothe themselves and farm to feed themselves—this is called "shared virtue." Uniting without faction is called "Heaven’s spontaneity." In the age of utmost virtue, their movements are steady, their gazes unassuming. At that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges; the myriad things grew wild, their villages contiguous; birds and beasts thrived in herds, grasses and trees flourished unchecked. Thus, one could lead beasts by a tether and wander freely, or climb to inspect the nests of crows and magpies. In the age of utmost virtue, humans dwelled alongside birds and beasts, mingled with the myriad things—how could one distinguish between noble and base? With shared ignorance, their virtue remained unsevered; with shared desirelessness, they embodied uncarved simplicity. In simplicity, human nature is preserved.

Yet when sages arose, they clambered to promote benevolence, strained to uphold righteousness—and the world began to doubt. They sprawled into music, dissected into ritual—and the world began to divide. If unhewn simplicity is not marred, who would fashion sacrificial vessels? If white jade is not shattered, who would carve ceremonial tablets? If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, why adopt benevolence and righteousness? If nature and emotion remain unsevered, why employ ritual and music? If the five colors are not disordered, who would create patterned designs? If the five tones are not confused, who would harmonize the six pitches?

To carve simplicity into vessels is the craftsman’s crime; to destroy the Dao and virtue for benevolence and righteousness is the sage’s error.

Guo’s commentary: *To govern by non-governance is true governance.* The virtues of the people differ in small ways but align in the essentials. What cannot be forsaken is clothing and food; what cannot be abandoned is farming and weaving—these are the shared foundations of the world. Those who uphold this Way reach the pinnacle of non-action, so that when left to themselves, they naturally unite—not through faction, but through Heaven’s spontaneity. *Steady and unassuming* describes contentment without external cravings. Not seeking undeserved gains, they find sufficiency within their households. In primordial chaos, all things attain their due, and the world dwells in tranquil indifference—how could states differ or households diverge? Content with their nature, free from rapacious desires, they harmonize with things without harm, their virtue unsevered and their nature preserved in simplicity, untroubled by knowledge or desire.

The sage is the thoroughfare through which the people attain their nature—not the means by which it is obstructed. The phrase "when sages arose" is akin to saying "when the thoroughfare emerged." Once the sage’s progress is manifest, benevolence and righteousness lose their authenticity, ritual and music depart from nature, and only their outward forms remain. With sages come these ills—what is to be done?

To carve simplicity into vessels, shatter jade into tablets, transform plain colors into patterns, and tune sounds to pitch—all are shifts from the unhewn to the ornate, abandoning roots to exalt branches, marring Heaven’s simplicity. Though the world may prize these things, they are not true treasures. Craftsmen have their compasses and squares; sages have their vaunted progress.

Lü’s commentary: When the people return to their inherent nature and do not stray from their truth, the so-called sages cannot be seen. Thus, desireless and simple, there is no doubt; with shared virtue and no division, there is no separation. But once truth is forsaken and sages emerge, promoting benevolence and righteousness not from spontaneity, instituting ritual and music not from perfect rectitude—the world begins to doubt and divide. Carving simplicity into vessels illustrates the destruction of the Dao and virtue for benevolence and righteousness; shattering jade into tablets illustrates the severance of emotion and nature for ritual and music. All are superfluous, branching paths.

Abandon craft and return to simplicity, and the craftsman’s crime is erased; discard benevolence and righteousness to embrace the Dao and virtue, and the sage’s error is absolved.

The *Yi Du Zhu* states: The divine beings of antiquity, in their governance of the world, held no intent to rule, but followed the people’s constant nature, aligning only with the ultimate of the true mandate. They wove to clothe themselves, tilled to feed themselves, shared virtue in mutual kinship, and formed no factions. That which is "heavenly released" arises from spontaneity, not human artifice. "Filled" means replete within; "manifest" means truth revealed without. They acted as their feet led them, not by crooked paths, trusted what their eyes beheld, and did not stray into depravity. Birds and beasts, grasses and trees—all fulfilled the principle of their natures without premature decay or obstruction. Beasts could be tethered, nests could be approached, for when humans lacked cunning hearts, creatures had nothing to fear. Dwelling together in tribes, the people rejoiced of themselves—how would they know of gentlemen or petty men? To be "the same in non-knowing" is not to lack innate knowledge; to be "the same in non-desiring" is not to lack what may be desired. It begins with virtue undivided and ends in what is called uncarved simplicity—the people’s constant nature is thus attained.

"Zheng-dun-ti-fu" describes the exertion of effort. To practice benevolence and righteousness without following the principle of nature and mandate is to begin the world’s doubt. "Straying and diffuse" is the dissipation of music; "selective and partial" is the bias of ritual. From transformed righteousness arise ritual and music; from ritual and music, nature and emotion become divided—this is how the world comes to be split. Now, benevolence and righteousness emerge from the Dao and virtue, while ritual and music arise from nature and emotion. In high antiquity, the age was plain and the people simple: benevolence and righteousness were one with the Dao and virtue, ritual and music were inseparable from nature and emotion. In later ages, the Dao and virtue were abandoned in favor of benevolence and righteousness, nature and emotion were set aside to discuss ritual and music—thus arose the benevolence and righteousness of Zeng and Shi, which were not the righteousness of Yao and Shun, and the ritual and music of the common age, which were not the ritual and music of the Three Dynasties. This is why Laozi sought to strike them down and eradicate them, and why Zhuangzi likewise rejected them. To carve simplicity into vessels, the craftsman cannot but bear guilt; in seeking to remedy near corruption, even the sage cannot but incur error.

The *Xiang Dao Zhu* states: In the age of utmost virtue, nurturing life did not yield to craving or desire, and their conduct was full and steady, their gaze direct and unerring. What they sought did not exceed their proper share, so mountains had no paths or tunnels, and marshes no boats or bridges. Thus, they saw others as themselves, saw themselves as things, forgot both self and other, and made no distinction between inner and outer. This is why they could enter among beasts without disturbing the herd, or among birds without disrupting their flight—how would they know of gentlemen or petty men? The mind may possess knowledge and choose, yet return to non-knowing and embrace all; the will may have desires and move, yet the bones stand without desire. In governing the world, the sage empties what has knowledge and fills what has none, thus enabling the people to be the same in non-knowing; weakens what has desire and strengthens what has none, thus enabling the people to be the same in non-desiring. Non-knowing ensures virtue remains undivided; non-desiring ensures the people remain in uncarved simplicity. "Unadorned" is the substance of nature, pure and white, unstained by things. "Uncarved" is the wholeness of nature, undifferentiated and unscattered into vessels. As the *Laozi* says: "Manifest the unadorned, embrace the uncarved, lessen selfishness, diminish desire." The scripture states: "Unadorned and uncarved, none in the world contend with them"—this is the abundance that comes from attaining the people’s nature.

The *Bi Xu Zhu* states: The people have a constant nature: they know to weave for clothing and till for food, are one and form no factions, roam in spontaneity, trade has not yet arisen, they do not visit one another, customs are frugal and things flourish, within there is no cunning and without there is no fear—thus uncarved and simple, the people’s nature is attained. Those who are unskilled in governance exert effort to practice benevolence, pride themselves on upholding righteousness, depart from the Dao to do good, and harbor doubt without trust. They bend and twist to create ritual, indulge in excess for music, act with treacherous virtue, and split the harmony of equilibrium. Sacrificial vessels and the six pitch-pipes are all methods of orderly governance, but in excess they become disorder. That this is called the craftsman’s guilt and the sage’s error reveals the common tendency of past and present to assign blame only when ruin is evident.

The *Fu Qi* states: "Shared virtue" means what they receive from heaven is the same. "Constant nature" is what the previous chapter called "constant thusness"—pure and without faction, freely delighting in spontaneity. "Full and steady" describes contentment; "direct and unerring" describes straightforward gazing—both depict their artless, uncalculating manner. "Mountains have no paths or tunnels" means roads were not yet opened; "marshes have no boats or bridges" means fords were not yet established.

All things perpetually thrive, bound to their native lands; birds and beasts dwell intermingled, yet nothing harms another. Grasses and trees grow unchecked, never suffering the calamity of axe or adze. Beasts roam tethered, nests are climbed and inspected—humans and creatures forget one another. In such a state, how could there be any division between noble and base? Without knowledge or desire, they are purely of heaven’s principle.

Yet when sages arise, they forcibly enact benevolence and righteousness, disseminating rites and music, and only then do preferences begin to diverge, no longer purely one. The Way and virtue are natural; Zhuangzi treats benevolence and righteousness as external, thus saying: "When the Way and virtue are not abandoned, why seek benevolence and righteousness?" Nature and emotion are inherent; Zhuangzi treats rites and music as forced upon the world, thus saying: "When nature and emotion are not estranged, why employ rites and music?" Ornamentation disorders the five colors; the six pitch-pipes disorder the five tones—all are metaphors for human effort, not spontaneity. The craftsman’s guilt and the sage’s error serve to conclude the preceding passage.

The earlier discussion of governance’s ills sought to reform them; thus it is said that good governance is otherwise. Above is set forth the age of utmost virtue, where the people’s nature is truly pure and without longing, where clothing and food suffice and there is no craving for excess. "Mountains have no paths or tunnels, marshes have no boats or bridges"—this means the people do not travel, and boats and carriages have no use. "Living things are bound together, grasses and trees grow unchecked"—this speaks of their flourishing abundance. "Beasts may be tethered, bird nests may be climbed"—this speaks of their artless merging with things. From this we know that phoenixes nest in towers and unicorns roam in parks: the utmost harmony summons them, and this principle is indeed so.

In such a state, those above have no desires, those below have no knowledge; virtue is not estranged, and the people remain simple. How then could there be any division between noble and base? Yet in later ages, sages governed the world through action, exerting themselves in benevolence and righteousness, striving to establish rites and music—only then did the people begin to doubt, and the world begin to divide.

Thus the *Nanhua* deems the carving of unhewn wood and the cutting of jade the craftsman’s guilt, and the abandonment of the Way for benevolence the sage’s error. Yet if unhewn wood and jade are not carved, how can vessels be made? If benevolence and righteousness are not established, how can the Way be protected? It is said: the world’s unhewn wood has long since scattered—there is no end to the need for vessels. The Way of the sages has long since scattered: first it transformed into benevolence and righteousness, then into rites and music, and now benevolence, righteousness, rites, and music remain in name alone. This will cause later generations to lament those who come after.

**Chapter Two: "Horse’s Hooves"**

Now, the horse—dwelling on land, it eats grass and drinks water; when joyful, it rubs necks with its kin; when enraged, it turns its back and kicks. This is all the horse knows. Yet when a crossbar is fastened upon it, when its head is adorned with crescent-shaped ornaments, the horse learns to swerve, to balk, to startle, to feign, to gnaw the bit, and to steal the reins. Thus, the horse’s knowledge and ability to become a thief are the fault of Bo Le.

In the age of Emperor Hexu, the people dwelt without knowing what to do, wandered without knowing where to go, chewed their food in contentment, and strolled with bellies full—this was all they knew how to do. But when the sages came, bending and shaping rites and music to correct the forms of the world, dangling the snares of benevolence and righteousness to soothe the hearts of the world, the people then began to stretch and strain for cunning, to vie for profit without cease. This, too, is the fault of the sages.

*Guo’s annotation:* If one guides by true knowledge and rides by nature, then a journey of ten thousand *li* may be reached without losing the horse’s true nature. Yet when horses of differing natures are uniformly pressed into service, their strength is exhausted, and their postures become forced.

The people’s true ability lay in chewing their food and strolling with full bellies. But when the sages bent and shaped them with rites and music, dangled the seven virtues before them, the people began to crave knowledge—all these faults arise from urging them toward what is esteemed.

*Lü’s annotation:* The horse’s eating grass and drinking water, its rubbing and kicking, are all it knows—just as the people of Emperor Hexu’s time, without knowledge or striving, chewed their food and strolled with full bellies. The fastening of the crossbar and the adorning with crescent ornaments are like the bending and shaping of rites and music, the dangling of the seven virtues to correct and soothe the world. The horse’s learning to swerve, feign, gnaw the bit, and steal the reins is like the people’s stretching, straining, craving knowledge, and vying for profit without cease.

To swerve (*jieni*) is to resist control; to balk (*yine*) is to refuse restraint; to startle (*jing*) is to be struck with fear; to feign (*man*) is to simulate illness—all describe the horse’s state of fury. To gnaw the bit (*guixian*) is to free the bit itself; to steal the reins (*qiepei*) is to slip free of the reins. When man harms the horse’s true nature, it becomes crafty and turns to theft. This is the fault of Bo Le.

If one wishes the horse’s knowledge not to lead to theft and the human heart not to crave knowledge, there is no other way—only by returning to true nature.

*Yi Du’s annotation:* The horse’s true nature lies in eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty, submitting when joyful, and kicking when enraged—it knows nothing beyond this. But when the crossbar is fastened and the crescent ornaments are applied (the crescent-shaped ornament on the forehead resembles the moon; *qi* means to adorn and arrange), the horse’s body is labored, and so it learns to swerve. *Jie* is like the *jie* in "attendant" (*binjie*), referring to those who assist the horse on either side. *Ni* is the same as in "herdsman" (*maoni*), meaning the one who tends the horse. When the horse is constrained by man, it learns of attendants and herdsmen, and deceit arises.

To balk (*chan*) is to block the will; to restrain (*e*) is to prevent the body from stretching; to startle (*jing*) is like being struck with fear; to feign (*man*) is like being stricken with illness—all describe its state of fury. To gnaw the bit (*guixian*) is to free the bit; to steal the reins (*qiepei*) is to slip free of the reins. When man harms the horse’s true nature, it becomes crafty and turns to theft. This is the fault of Bo Le.

Emperor Hexu was a sovereign of high antiquity. The people dwelt without knowing what to do, wandered without knowing where to go, chewed their food in contentment, and strolled with bellies full—like infants, they knew nothing beyond this. The bending and shaping of rites are but the ends of propriety, able only to correct outward forms but not the nature and emotions. The dangling of benevolence and righteousness is but the ends of virtue, sufficient to soothe the heart but unable to bring lasting peace.

Thus the people’s love of knowledge knows no end—this, too, is the fault of the sages.

*Xiang Dao’s Commentary* notes: The sages soothed the hearts of the world with benevolence and righteousness, and the people first began to doubt; they corrected the forms of the world with rites and music, and the people first began to divide. A horse eating grass and drinking water is like the people plowing to eat and weaving to clothe themselves. When pleased, they rub necks together; when angered, they turn their backs on one another—just as the people remain one and do not form factions. Piercing oxen and bridling horses are all the faults of human artifice. That horses, through their cunning, can become thieves—is this good horsemanship? Thus this chapter, from beginning to end, speaks of this to condemn the extremes of human artifice.

I say: to abandon the Dao and virtue and pursue benevolence and righteousness is to leave ruler and minister, father and son unable to avoid division and doubt. To abandon benevolence and righteousness and follow the Dao and virtue is to dwell in kinship even with birds and beasts and the myriad things. Thus the chapter concludes with Hexu.

*Bixu’s Commentary* notes: The true knowledge of horses was known only by Zaofu and Taibing, who, without applying whip or spur, could ride a thousand *li* in a day. But from Bo Le onward, horses were fitted with crossbars and bits, their foreheads marked with moon-shaped plates, and thus they could not escape the vices of gnawing the bit and stealing the reins. The constant nature of the people was known only by Hexu, who, without establishing laws and measures, allowed them all to follow their Heaven-given nature. But from Yao and Shun onward, rites and music bent and shaped them, benevolence and righteousness were dangled before them, rewards and punishments were added, and strife never ceased—its ills grew ever worse. Thus it is called the fault of the sages.

*The Oral Teachings of Yongqi* states: This passage takes the earlier argument and turns it to even greater wonder. Observe its phrases "rubbing necks" and "turning backs"—they vividly show the states of joy and anger. The "moon-shaped plate" is what we now call the forehead mirror. *Jie* means "alone," the state of standing apart and glaring in anger. *Min’e* means curving the neck to resist the bit. *Jing* means fierce. *Man* means sudden. It describes their resistance to bridling, their cunning in slipping the bit, their stealth in seizing the reins, and their defiance of human control—hence they are called thieves, and this is Bo Le’s doing. Had there been no crossbars, bits, or reins, how could their defiant, glaring, resistant postures have appeared? The people’s love of knowledge and competition for profit are no different from the horses’ gnawing of bits and stealing of reins.

The sages of antiquity took the well-being of the world as their duty, fearing even a single person might lose their place. They sought to nurture and secure them—how could this have been for worldly gain? It arose from the truth of human nature and the uprightness of the Dao and virtue, from what was right for them to do. This is called "the highest virtue does not act as virtue," "the lower know only that it exists," and "praise and fame do not reach it." But in later ages, simplicity scattered and the people grew cunning; deceit and artifice arose. Those who responded to the mandate of the sages crawled and toiled, striving to rescue the people from fire and water. They earnestly guided them, awakening them from their delusions. They loved and benefited them, and benevolence flourished; they restrained and regulated them, and righteousness bore fruit; they ordered and adorned them, and rites arose; they harmonized and delighted them, and music emerged. This, too, was a matter of following what the people valued and adapting to what was fitting, establishing institutions—it was not yet a grave departure. Yet when governance endures, the people grow complacent; when laws endure, abuses arise. Reforms become harsh, strict orders invite transgression—such is the inevitable course of events.

Alas! Once the seven apertures are drilled, can one ever return to the state of chaos? This is why *The Horses’ Hooves* was written, and why its metaphors and analogies are so numerous and far-reaching. The final section returns to the true knowledge of horses, restoring the chapter’s original intent. It cites the age of Hexu, when the people knew only to chew their food and drum their bellies, content in effortless ease—from this, one can see that those above did not disturb them.

The *Nanhua* [i.e., *Zhuangzi*] invokes the past to illuminate the present, hoping to restore a fraction of the ancient purity. Yet how can the world’s ways, rushing toward profit without cease, be halted? In the end, it ascribes blame to the sages—how could a gentleman of words refrain from doing so? It is urgent in warning the people’s hearts and rescuing the age’s ills, and thus it must invert matters to correct them. Yet some criticize it as the work of a disgruntled hero—this is a mistake! Those who would truly understand the *Zhuangzi* should grasp its intent and overlook its words.

*Jieni* was formerly read as *jiani*, a harsh sound with an obscure meaning. Here it is restored to its original pronunciation: when people use knowledge to control horses, the horses’ knowledge first shows signs of defiance, plotting to gnaw the bit and steal the reins. Thus horses are not inherently cunning—it is humans who awaken their cunning.

This chapter’s single intent is divided into four sections. The first introduces the theme, using the governance of horses to illustrate the governance of the people. This aligns with the *Book of Documents*’ metaphor of horse-tending for ruling the people, but here the chapter’s beginning and end depict the horse’s nature, emotions, joys, and angers with such vivid detail that even the finest painter could not surpass it. How, then, could the goodness or badness of the human heart escape its keen judgment?

The second section borrows the metaphor of molding clay to develop the argument, stating that deliberate action in governance, bending and distorting the people’s nature, is inferior to non-action and allowing things to transform themselves. It then cites the age of utmost virtue, when there was no knowledge or desire, and the later kings’ establishment of laws, which first caused the world to doubt—no different from Bo Le’s burning, branding, carving, and boring to pursue the "gait of the wind," which was called governance but brought the greatest harm. This is what is meant by the sages’ fault: they set up benevolence, righteousness, rites, and music to teach the people, commanding and urging them, fearing they would not comply. Yet they did not realize that as branches and leaves flourished, roots and trunks withered; as government became more manifest, deceit and abuses arose. This is how simplicity scattered, punishments arose, and strife between high and low never ceased.

Thus the *Qiushui* [i.e., *Zhuangzi*] speaks loftily to correct this, using broad analogies to transform the world, urging it to abandon falsity and return to truth, to know where to turn. In this, one sees that the heart of the perfected person has not yet hardened toward the world. The final section invokes the ancient people’s simplicity and the thickness of their customs, their joyful ease, to prove the efficacy of the ancient kings’ non-action. Later sages bound them with rites and music, soothed them with benevolence and righteousness, and sought governance to excess—until it became ungovernable.

The Supreme One says: "Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish." The *Nanhua*’s discourse grasps this truth.

**Opening the Strongbox**

To guard against thieves who pry open strongboxes, rummage through bags, or break into chests, one must tighten cords, fasten locks, and secure bolts—this is what the common world calls "wisdom." Yet when a great thief arrives, he hoists the chest, lifts the box, and shoulders the bag, fleeing with all haste, only fearing that the cords and locks are not secure enough. Thus, what was once called "harmony" has become nothing more than stockpiling for the great thief.

Let us examine this: Is there any so-called "wisdom" in the common world that does not accumulate for the great thief? Is there any so-called "sage" who does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so?

In ancient times, the villages of Qi were so close that one could see their neighbors and hear the cries of their chickens and dogs. Nets and snares were spread, and plows and hoes tilled the land across more than two thousand *li*. Within its four borders, the establishment of ancestral temples, altars of soil and grain, cities, houses, prefectures, districts, townships, and hamlets—was there ever a time when these were not modeled after the sages? Yet one morning, Tian Chengzi killed the ruler of Qi and stole his state. What he stole was not merely the state—he also seized the sages’ wisdom and laws. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of a bandit, yet lived in the security of Yao and Shun; small states dared not condemn him, and great states dared not punish him. For twelve generations, he held Qi. Was this not stealing the state along with its sagely laws to guard his bandit’s body?

Guo’s commentary: "Accumulating for the great thief, guarding for the great thief—this is how unreliable wisdom proves to be. Those who model themselves after sages follow only their traces, and traces are but the remnants of what has passed, not tools for responding to change. How can they be revered and clung to? Clinging to fixed forms to govern the boundless, when the boundless arrives, one becomes obstructed. This is why one guards a state only to have it guarded by others. If the great thief does not steal the sagely laws, he has no means to overthrow the state. Sagely laws are merely tools for human use, not instruments of perfect governance."

Lü’s commentary: "Tightening cords and fastening locks to prevent thieves from prying open boxes or breaking into chests—this is what the common world calls 'wisdom.' Yet when the great thief arrives, he carries them off, only fearing they are not secure enough. Thus, is there any so-called 'wisdom' in the common world that does not accumulate for the great thief? Establishing ancestral temples, altars of soil and grain, cities, houses, prefectures, and districts to guard the four borders—this is what the common world calls 'sageliness.' Tian Chengzi stole Qi along with its sagely laws to guard his bandit’s body. Is there any so-called 'sage' who does not guard for the great thief? Such is the sageliness and wisdom of the common world—true sageliness and wisdom are not like this!"

Yu Du’s commentary: "To *dun* is to secretly open. Tightening cords and fastening locks—this is the wisdom of the common world, sufficient only to fend off petty thieves. When the great thief arrives, he carries them off, and the very cords and locks that were meant to prevent theft instead become resources for the thief. The 'wisdom' of the common world is not the wisdom that encompasses all things, so it inevitably accumulates for the great thief. The 'sageliness' of the common world is not the unknowable sageliness, so it inevitably guards for the great thief. This is why Laozi and Zhuangzi sought to abandon it. Tian Cheng stole the state along with its sagely laws to guard his bandit’s body. Thus, all the sagely institutions that appear in the laws are not exempt from theft. Yet to compare Tian Cheng’s security to that of Yao and Shun—is this not excessive?

One may ask: All those who possess a body and are entrusted with the world are but husks and remnants—what is there to compare in terms of superiority or inferiority? As for Yao and Shun, who could not be entrusted with the world, how could Tian Chengzi be placed on par with them?"

Bi Xu’s commentary: "*Zhi* refers to those who craft baskets, chests, cords, and locks. *Ji* refers to those who amass and hoard treasures. *Sheng* refers to those who wield tallies, weights, scales, axes, and halberds. *Shou* refers to those who protect ancestral temples, altars of soil and grain, and borders. Moreover, the institutions and laws established in Qi were never not modeled after the sages, yet Tian Cheng seized their sagely wisdom and took possession of the state. Thus, sagely wisdom becomes the resource of the great thief!"

Yongzhai’s commentary: "The wisdom of the common world is originally meant to guard against petty thieves. When the great thief arrives, he carries it all away. When the Tian clan usurped Qi, they lent grain at private measures but collected at public ones—this is evident in the *Zuozhuan*. They borrowed the sages’ laws to advance their bandit schemes, as was common in the Warring States period. This is why Zhuangzi used this analogy. Guarding against thieves with cords and locks is the wisdom of the common world. Breaking into houses, shouldering chests, and rummaging through bags—this is the wisdom that transcends the common. How often does one encounter such transcendent wisdom in the workings of creation? If used to steal the harmony of heaven to nourish the body and preserve the spirit, or to steal the benefits of earth to enrich one’s family and state, what could not be achieved? Yet instead, one covets the hidden treasures of a room, seeking ill-gotten gains while disregarding the inescapable judgment of the public and the indelible stench of infamy. How can one not reflect deeply on this?

I have examined the cause: If the world had no accumulations to guard, how could thieves seize them? From the desire to fill one’s baskets to the theft of a state—truly, one must be vigilant against the first frost, lest it lead to solid ice! The thief of a state, if he does not steal its sagely laws along with it, has no means to establish himself. Thus, sagely laws are the sharpest tools in the world—it all depends on how one uses them."

Should its power fall into the hands of a cunning usurper, none have failed to be controlled by it in turn. As the later text states: *"He who steals a hook is executed; he who steals a state becomes a feudal lord."* Yet at the gates of these lords, "benevolence and righteousness" reside—petty thieves face execution while great thieves go unrestrained. How can this serve as a defense for the common people? Having stolen a state to become its ruler, he then forbids the people from theft—does he not know that benevolence and righteousness cannot be abandoned? Is this not using the sagely laws to guard his own thievish person? Zhuangzi of the Painted Hall lamented this truth, thereby condemning the ambitions of usurpers through the ages. The severity of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* may thus stand alongside it in the world.

Let us examine this: Among those the world calls most wise, are there none who accumulate for great thieves? Among those called most sagely, are there none who guard for great thieves? How do we know this is so? In ancient times, Long Feng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Chang Hong was torn apart, and Wu Zixu was torn to shreds—though all four were virtuous, their lives could not escape destruction. Thus, when Robber Zhi asked the Master of the Broad Hall, *"Does theft have its own Way?"* the Master replied, *"Where could there be no Way? To divine the treasures hidden in a room is wisdom; to enter first is courage; to withdraw last is righteousness; to know what is possible is knowledge; to divide spoils equally is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief."*

From this we see: the good cannot stand without the Way of the sage, nor can Robber Zhi act without it. Since the good in the world are few and the ungood many, the sage’s benefit to the world is slight while his harm is great. Thus it is said: *"When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when Lu’s wine was weak, Handan was besieged."* The sage’s rise gives birth to great thieves. Only by striking down the sage and releasing the restraint on thieves can the world begin to be ordered. When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. Once the sage is dead, great thieves will not arise, and the world will be at peace without incident. But so long as the sage does not die, great thieves will not cease. To rely on the sage to govern the world is to multiply the gains of Robber Zhi.

When measures and bushels are made to quantify, they are stolen along with the grain; when scales and balances are made to weigh, they are stolen along with the goods; when tallies and seals are made to authenticate, they are stolen along with the authority; when benevolence and righteousness are made to rectify, they are stolen along with the virtues. How do we know this is so? He who steals a hook is executed; he who steals a state becomes a feudal lord. At the gates of these lords, benevolence and righteousness reside—is this not the theft of benevolence, righteousness, and sagely wisdom? Thus, those who pursue great thieves, exalt feudal lords, and steal the benefits of benevolence, righteousness, measures, scales, tallies, and seals—even the rewards of high office cannot entice them, nor the threat of the executioner’s axe deter them. This multiplication of gains for Robber Zhi, making him unstoppable, is the fault of the sage.

Therefore it is said: *"A fish must not leave the depths; the state’s sharpest tools must not be displayed."* The sage is the world’s sharpest tool, not something to be flaunted before it. Guo Xiang’s commentary notes: *"When tyrannical rulers wield the authority of kings to slaughter worthy ministers, none dare resist—all because of the sagely laws. Without these laws, how could Jie and Zhou have unleashed their poison and made the world tremble?"* Wisdom, courage, righteousness, knowledge, and benevolence—these five are meant to restrain thieves, yet they become the very resources of theft. Thus, the sage’s benefit to the world is slight while his harm is great.

Though these words are true, the sage cannot be entirely abolished, for the world’s knowledge has not yet been wholly eradicated. Thus, the sagely Way is still needed to govern it. If knowledge is not abolished but sagely wisdom alone is discarded, the world’s harm will be greater than if the sage remained. Though the harm of the sage is great, it is still preferable to the chaos of a world without him. Yet even this is not as good as abolishing all knowledge and leaving no harm at all.

How grave it is! The world seeks nothing but profit, yet cannot unite in abandoning its knowledge. How deluded it is, losing the path to its own nature! The lips do not grow cold to chill the teeth, nor did Lu’s weak wine besiege Handan—yet when the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when Lu’s wine was weak, Handan was besieged. The sage’s rise does not intend to give birth to great thieves, yet great thieves arise. This is the natural order of mutual generation, the inevitable sequence of events.

Moreover, the sage does not establish reverence for things, yet cannot prevent things from revering him. Regardless of rank or truth, if sagely laws are exalted, the world will swallow its voice and submit in unison—this is precisely what Jie and Zhou relied upon to perfect their great theft. If instead one rejects reverence and embraces simplicity, discarding prohibitions and replacing them with few desires, then by striking down the sage, one’s own simplicity remains intact. Even if thieves are left unchecked, their villainy will naturally cease.

Draining rivers does not intend to empty valleys, nor does leveling hills intend to fill abysses—yet when rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. Abolishing the sage does not intend to stop theft, yet when the sage is abolished, theft ceases. Once theft ceases, the pursuit of ostentation and excess vanishes entirely.

To rely on the sage to govern the world is to provide Jie and Zhou with his laws. The more they rely on them, the greater the gains they cannot relinquish. Thus, petty thieves follow their lead, and great thieves profit from them. The rewards of high office and the axe of execution—these weighty tools are meant to restrain thieves. Yet great thieves pursue and steal them, turning them to their own use. Thus, they perfect their great theft, wielding the seven virtues, leveling with scales, authenticating with tallies, enticing with high office, and threatening with the axe. Only by stealing these public instruments can they exalt themselves as feudal lords.

Therefore, benevolence, righteousness, rewards, and punishments are sufficient only to execute those who steal hooks. That great thieves cannot be restrained stems from the weight of their stolen gains. The weight of these gains comes from the sage’s refusal to relinquish them. When fish leave the depths, they are caught by men; when sharp tools are displayed, they become resources for thieves. Thus, they must not be shown to others.

Lü’s Annotation: What the world calls knowledge and what it calls sageliness are both constructed through laws. Even the utmost knowledge and utmost sageliness do not transcend the names of sageliness, courage, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence—yet they know not *how* knowledge is knowledge, nor *how* sageliness is sageliness. Thus, the Four Masters could not preserve their own bodies, while the corrupt instead turned these very qualities into resources for theft. What the world calls sageliness and knowledge thus becomes nothing more than the accumulated stores of great thieves.

Utmost knowledge lies in unknowing; utmost sageliness lies in namelessness. Yet the world’s sageliness and knowledge instead serve to empower thieves—thus, they benefit the world little and harm it much, no idle claim. Lips and teeth exemplify mutual dependence; the thin wine of Lu and the siege of Deng’s capital exemplify how things not inherently dependent may yet become so.

Therefore, to govern the world, nothing surpasses abandoning the trappings of the sage, releasing thieves and brigands, and forgetting both good and evil. The heart’s valley is not empty, yet thievish thoughts arise within it because the sage is treated as a deep abyss and dammed. Drain the sage’s river to dryness, and the valley will empty, and thieves will not arise. The heart’s abyss is not solid, yet thievish thoughts enter its gaps because the sage is treated as a mound and toppled. Level the sage’s mound and reduce it, and the abyss will fill, and thieves will not encroach. This is why, when the sage is already dead, great thieves do not arise, and the world remains without incident. What is called death is simply the cessation of such thoughts.

When thievish thoughts arise and great thieves emerge, even if one relies heavily on the sage to govern the world, this is merely heaping advantages for thieves—this is elaborated below in the passage on "stealing them together." Thus, those who steal hooks are executed, while those who steal states become feudal lords, and none can restrain them. At the gates of feudal lords, benevolence and righteousness reside—this is to steal sageliness, knowledge, benevolence, and righteousness together. How much more so for those who exalt themselves above feudal lords? Even with chariots, caps, axes, and halberds, none can restrain or encourage them.

All this stems from the error of deviating from the true to become a sage, yet still using the sage’s laws to enlighten the world—this is to display sharp tools to others. Thus, great thieves are able to seize them.

Yi Du’s Annotation: The Dao has both noble and base adherents. Those who attain the Dao’s correctness find sageliness, courage, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence all aligned with it. Yet when these qualities are pursued in their incorrect forms, they become nothing more than the tools of great thieves. What thieves call the Dao is merely the deluded intent they harbor, entering first and exiting last, discerning right from wrong, and dividing things equally. Those who grasp a part of it become petty thieves; those who destroy and seize it all become great ones.

Zhuangzi once used parables in the *Miscellaneous Chapters* to contrast with our Master Confucius, clarifying that the knowledge of great thieves and great sages is the same—only their application differs. The good use these five qualities to establish themselves; the wicked use them to become thieves. Good and evil both originate in the human heart, yet those who do good in the world are always few, while those who do evil are always many—this is why Zhuangzi so sharply corrects them.

The weak wine of Lu and the siege of Deng’s capital, the rise of sages and the emergence of great thieves—this is the natural principle of mutual generation, reaching its extreme. Did the sages who established laws intend to provoke human deceit? People merely followed their traces to create falsehood. What is called "striking down the sage" is a profound rejection of the sage’s advancement—akin to the Chan saying, "Had I met Śākyamuni at his birth, I would have struck him dead with one blow." Releasing thieves and brigands is likewise meant to end deception.

The waters of rivers and valleys flow into one another; mounds and abysses rely on each other—this illustrates how the sage’s traces become resources for great thieves. When the sage is already dead, this embodies the intent to "abandon sageliness and discard knowledge." When great thieves do not arise, the paths of contention and striving all vanish.

If one does not abolish sageliness and knowledge to stop theft but instead relies even more on the sage’s laws to govern the world, the corrupt will seize upon them to become thieves—this is heaping advantages for them. Measures, scales, tallies, seals, benevolence, and righteousness are all tools by which the sage governs the world. Zhuangzi’s meaning is that anything involving forms, implements, or laws becomes a resource for great thieves. When thieves steal a state, measures, scales, tallies, and seals all fall into their possession, and punishments and rewards issue from them alone.

Moreover, the forms, implements, and laws by which Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties harmonized governance are the same as those of later ages—yet their success and failure differ. What they relied upon was indeed these things, but once their achievements were complete, these things, though still present, could be discarded. Later ages, clinging rigidly to these as their sole reliance, find that once their authority falls into the hands of the treacherous, what they relied upon for stability often leads to peril—this is exemplified by the case of Tian Chengzi.

The sage retreats into seclusion, wielding ultimate power to turn the myriad transformations, thus moving heaven and earth without the world perceiving his mechanism, and subduing the realm without people naming him as martial. This is how he guides the ten thousand things within the realm, and none in the world can resist—how could he display sharp tools to others?

Detailed Daoist Annotation: In governing others, none surpasses the state of Qi; in governing oneself, none surpasses the Four Masters; in bringing chaos to others, none surpasses Robber Zhi. All claimed to have modeled themselves on the sages. Yet Qi could not escape the usurpation of the Tian clan; the Four Masters could not evade the execution of their contemporary rulers; while Robber Zhi ended his life in old age.

Thus, modeling oneself on the sages to govern brings no benefit; stealing the sages’ teachings to do evil incurs no harm. The sages’ relation to the world, then, is not enough to stop thieves—it is precisely enough to provoke them. Zhuangzi was not ignorant of the sages; he merely responded to things as circumstances demanded.

Yet later ages saw calamities and chaos arise in their wake—this is like lips perishing and teeth growing cold, or the thin wine of Lu leading to the siege of Deng’s capital. Can one blame the lips for the teeth growing cold, or fault Lu for the siege of Deng? Those who invariably trace blame back to the sages are merely shirking the burdens of their own paths.

Master Bi Xu annotates: When knowledge emerges, it may bring either benefit or harm; when sageliness manifests, it may lead to life or death. One unmoved by benefit or harm possesses supreme knowledge; one undisturbed by life or death embodies supreme sageliness. As for the Four Masters—each prided themselves on knowledge and boasted of sageliness, only to bring about their own destruction—how could they have known true knowledge or true sageliness? Sageliness and knowledge are the very conditions that give rise to great thieves. When sageliness and knowledge arise, great thieves appear; when great thieves cease, sageliness and knowledge vanish. Seize and discard the sages, cast them away entirely. Release and abandon the thieves, hold no store in their plunder. When sageliness and knowledge are obliterated, the people’s nature returns to purity and simplicity, and the world is at peace, free of strife.

Those who steal benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and knowledge do so to exalt themselves; those who plunder gold, jewels, and jade do so to enrich themselves. Yet what Heaven bestows is public, while what men seize is private. If the public remains public and the private remains private, how could caps and carriages ever serve as incentives, or axes and halberds as deterrents? Master Yongzhai observes: Though the Four Masters were worthy, each met with punishment, while Robber Zhi evaded harm—this shows that worthiness is unreliable, and those who steal sageliness and knowledge may yet profit thereby. The Way of the thief is a fabrication by Zhuangzi to satirize the world; though his words seem strange, they hold profound truth. When he speaks of the few who benefit the world and the many who harm it, his insight is piercing. The analogies of lips and teeth, rivers and valleys, make clear that the sages do not create thieves—they instead provide the very means by which great thieves arise. If sages do not appear, great thieves will not arise, and without sages or thieves, the world governs itself. To esteem the sages and seek governance through them is to say that when sages reappear and establish laws, the wicked will seize upon them to deceive the world—just as the warring lords of the Warring States, who usurped and seized power, were all great thieves. Those who steal a belt-hook are executed, while those who steal a state become lords; once enthroned, they too claim to love the people and benefit all things—thus they steal benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and knowledge as well. Though called great thieves, all seek to overthrow them; yet when lords usurp states and rule over others, this is called "hoisting." And though the world has never punished them with execution, Zhuangzi’s words arise from indignation at such a world.

What the world calls supreme knowledge and supreme sageliness invariably ends up amassed by great thieves; by contrast, those who do not claim sageliness or knowledge have nothing to accumulate, and thieves cannot covet what they lack. Thus, he invokes the Four Worthies to prove that sageliness and knowledge cannot be relied upon. Heaven endows the loyal and worthy to correct the ruler and assist the state; where integrity and righteousness lie, they hold fast even unto death, without wavering. Yet those above may fail to perceive them, resenting their blunt words and thwarted desires. At first, they are distanced; in the end, they are banished or executed. Though their loyalty cannot be extinguished, it is only after their execution that the sighing ceases. The execution of the loyal and worthy is the good fortune of treacherous ministers. With such evidence of blame, how can a state endure? When ministers become great thieves, where is their excess? Their excess does not transcend the laws of sageliness and knowledge. Because what they seize is weighty, their plunder cannot be slight. Yet the steps to such calamity do not accumulate in a single day: they gauge their ruler’s susceptibility to deception, the officials’ vulnerability to fraud, and seize the moment, riding the tide to carry out their perverse designs. Still, they cannot escape relying on sageliness, knowledge, benevolence, and righteousness to govern, as the founders of states before them have done. As one declines and another rises, so do rivers, valleys, hills, and abysses wax and wane. When sages appear, thieves arise—just as the thin wine of Lu led to the siege of Deng’s capital. Though governance through sageliness and knowledge is esteemed, it is fitting that it should heavily benefit thieves. Those who steal a belt-hook are constrained by the laws of sageliness and knowledge, while those who steal a state seize those very laws to control others. Thus, the good are few, and the wicked many; though caps and carriages, axes and halberds exist, they cannot serve as incentives or deterrents.

The *Analects* says: "The people may be made to follow, but not to understand." If the sages’ governance of the world must rely on some mysterious transformation, then this passage—from "How could one not model oneself on the sages" to "The sages are the world’s sharpest instruments"—contains eleven instances of "sage." In the current text, all remain as such, though Chen Bixu’s edition, collated by Zhang Junfang, uniformly renders them as "sageliness and knowledge." Referring to earlier passages—"what the world calls knowledge, what the world calls sageliness"—this reading is also plausible. Given the chapter’s intent to critique the many flaws of lawmaking, following the Yuan edition is appropriate. My conjecture is that when Zhang was commissioned to collate the text, and when Bixu submitted his annotations for imperial review, they may have feared that passages discussing sages could cause offense, and so provisionally replaced them with "sageliness and knowledge," a change that persisted in transmission. Yet where "sage" is indispensable—such as "How could one not model oneself on the sages," "Without the sages’ Dao, nothing is established," "Without the sages’ Dao, nothing proceeds," "The sages are dead," "The sages do not die"—it cannot be altered. Elsewhere, replacing "sage" with "sageliness and knowledge" is also reasonable. As for "The sages are the world’s sharpest instruments," this undoubtedly refers to sageliness and knowledge.

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin, *Stealing the Chest*, Chapter Two

Thus, sever sageliness and cast off knowledge, and great thieves will cease; smash jade and shatter pearls, and petty thieves will not arise; burn tallies and break seals, and the people will return to simplicity; dismantle measures and snap scales, and the people will know no contention. Only when all the world’s sagely laws are exhausted can one begin to discuss matters with the people.

Uproot and confound the six pitch-pipes, melt down flutes and zithers, and stop up Master Kuang’s ears—then the world will begin to contain its own hearing. Erase patterns and scatter the five colors, glue shut Li Zhu’s eyes—then the world will begin to contain its own clarity. Destroy and discard hooks and marking-lines, cast aside compass and square, cripple the craftsman’s fingers—then the world will begin to possess its own skill. Thus it is said: “Great skill appears clumsy.”

Erase the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo, cast off benevolence and righteousness—then the world’s virtue will begin to merge in profound unity. When people contain their own clarity, the world will know no dissipation; when they contain their own hearing, the world will know no encumbrance; when they contain their own knowledge, the world will know no confusion; when they contain their own virtue—

Those such as Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Master Kuang, the craftsman, and Li Zhu all externally establish their virtue and thereby throw the world into chaos—such are those whom the Dao deems useless.

Guo’s commentary: Remove what they rely upon, and prohibitions become unnecessary; devalue what they prize, and punishments cease of themselves. Eliminate the means by which they feign rectitude, and their deceptions and artifices cannot proceed. Minor imbalances are the tools of major imbalances. When nothing external is feigned, one’s inner simplicity remains whole, and no harm of self-loss arises.

Sound and color are what Li and Kuang prize. One receives life with a fixed allotment, yet what they prize draws it away—thus life and destiny are lost. If instead one destroys what they prize, abandons their impositions, and follows one’s own nature, hearing and clarity are each preserved, and people contain their true essence.

Though the spider and mole-cricket are base creatures, they weave webs and roll pellets without seeking the craftsman’s aid—thus all things possess their own abilities. Though their abilities differ, if none dares deviate from what they practice, then what seems skillful becomes clumsy. Therefore, one who excels in employing others assigns tasks according to their abilities, does not demand of the people the craftsman’s skill, and allows the multitude of arts to appear unskilled—then the world naturally attains great skill. By using each one’s innate ability, compass and square may be discarded, and the master artisan’s fingers may be crippled.

Remove the standards that disorder one’s nature, and the world will each return to its simplicity and unite in profound virtue. Those like Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Li, Kuang, and the craftsman are endowed with diverse methods, causing the world to leap and emulate them. In emulation, one loses oneself; the loss originates from them—they are the instigators of chaos.

As for what the Dao employs: sight does not exceed what is seen, thus all eyes are perfectly clear; hearing does not exceed what is heard, thus all ears are perfectly keen; action does not exceed what is possible, thus all skills are perfectly adept; knowledge does not exceed what is known, thus one’s constant nature is perfectly suited; virtue does not exceed what is attained, thus all virtue is perfectly fitting. Why establish what lies beyond one’s inherent capacity, causing the world to race about without ability to return?

Lü’s commentary: What Zhuangzi calls “severing sageliness and casting off knowledge” does not mean destroying classics or abandoning governance and education—it means not allowing them to arise in the heart. “Smashing jade and shattering pearls” does not mean emptying treasuries or discarding them in the mountains—it means not harboring a mind that values them. “Burning tallies and breaking seals” does not mean burning and smashing them—it means trusting trust itself, so the people return to simplicity, and tallies and seals are no longer relied upon. “Dismantling measures and snapping scales” does not mean actually dismantling and snapping them—it means leveling levelness itself, so the people know no contention, and measures and scales are no longer relied upon. Only then do the people recover the essence of their nature and destiny, and one may begin to discuss matters with them.

Stopping up Master Kuang’s ears aims to return hearing inward; when I return hearing inward, the world contains its own hearing. Gluing shut Li Zhu’s eyes aims to turn vision inward; when I turn vision inward, the world contains its own clarity. Crippling the craftsman’s fingers allows the world to begin possessing its own skill. Erasing the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silencing the mouths of Yang and Mo—then the world’s virtue begins to merge in profound unity. This lies in my casting off knowledge and severing skill, not seeing what may be desired.

Those who externally establish their virtue and thereby plunge the world into chaos are not those who contain their own hearing, clarity, knowledge, and virtue, and return to the essence of nature and destiny—such are those whom the Dao deems useless. Yet some claim Zhuangzi truly wished to strike down the sages, release thieves and bandits, and destroy laws and institutions—how could one engage in subtle discourse with such as these?

Yi Du’s commentary: Great thieves steal the law; petty thieves steal objects. Those who steal objects are restrained by law; those who steal the law are transformed by the Dao. Tallies and seals were originally meant to convey trust. Measures and scales were originally meant to achieve balance. Yet in their corruption, those who convey trust become utterly untrustworthy, and those who achieve balance become utterly unbalanced—this is why Zhuangzi wished to burn, break, dismantle, and snap them, so that eyes do not enter into color, ears do not enter into sound, and the heart does not enter into sensory entanglements. When the myriad forms and appearances are blocked externally, and one takes nature and destiny as the master, withdrawing vision and returning hearing, not yearning for Li or Kuang yet attaining what is inherently one’s own nature—this is called “great skill appears clumsy.”

Zeng, Shi, Yang, and Mo confuse and disorder the world—thus one wishes to erase their conduct and silence their mouths, so all return to unity, and the world’s virtue begins to revert to the Dao and merge in profound unity. When people contain their own clarity, the world’s clarity suffices for mutual illumination; when they contain their own hearing, the world’s hearing suffices for self-perception; when they contain their own knowledge, the world’s knowledge suffices for self-understanding; when they contain their own virtue, the world’s virtue suffices for self-attainment.

Thus one remains unscorched and unburdened, undeluded and unswayed. Those several masters—Zeng, Shi, Li, and Kuang—all fail to fulfill their inherent nature, causing the world to exhaust its spirit and weary its thoughts in pursuit of them, thereby plunging the world into chaos. Such methods serve no purpose in the Dao.

As detailed in the *Daoist Commentaries*: Xun Qing said, "Tallies, contracts, and deeds serve as tokens of trust. If superiors favor schemes and stratagems, inferiors will exploit this and resort to deceit. Lots and hooks serve as means of impartiality; if superiors favor partiality and self-interest, inferiors will exploit this, and even balanced scales and hanging weights will be skewed. Measuring vessels and grain measures serve as means of fairness; if superiors favor subversion, inferiors will exploit this and resort to treachery. If superiors covet profit, inferiors will exploit this and descend into baseness." Thus, laws arise from the sage’s necessity and are preserved by later kings’ vigilance. With the right people but no such laws, antiquity did not fail to achieve good governance; with such laws but no such people, the degenerate age cannot avoid theft and disorder.

Zhuangzi’s discourse does not encompass the mutual reliance of people and laws. To measure by these standards, to correct by these means—such actions invite theft of the very principles, leading only to joy in burning, smashing, snatching, and breaking without end. His intent is to sing of the dissolution of the scattered and its return to unity, to strip away the flowery and restore the fruit, thereby reverting to the root of virtue and the Dao.

The *Bi Xu Lüe* omits this discussion. *Fu Zhai* states: "Striking jade, shattering pearls, even snatching measures and breaking scales—these are all hyperbolic expressions to reinforce the intent of 'rejecting sages and discarding knowledge,' not literal arguments. They align in meaning with the *Laozi*’s 'not valuing rare goods to prevent theft among the people,' though the rhetoric here is excessive."

Su Dongpo remarked: "When one learns to read, the seeds of sorrow and trouble begin—yet how could one wish for the world to remain entirely illiterate?" "Disturbing order" means to unravel and disrupt; "scorching and severing" means to burn and discard.

Externally displaying one’s virtue is to prize external things while losing one’s original heart. To sink into chaos without restraint is to disturb and disrupt it. This passage merely elaborates on the preceding text to conclude the intent of "rejecting sages and discarding knowledge," allowing people to preserve their nature and align in virtue. The various commentaries have already expounded on this in detail; no further redundant explanations are needed.

Do you alone not know of the age of utmost virtue? In ancient times, under the reigns of Rongcheng, Dating, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilu, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhu Rong, Fuxi, and Shennong, the people used knotted cords for record-keeping. They found sweetness in their simple food, beauty in their plain garments, joy in their customs, and contentment in their dwellings. Neighboring states were within sight of one another, the sounds of chickens and dogs carried between them, yet the people lived to old age and died without ever traveling to visit one another. In such an age, perfect governance prevailed. But now, it has come to this: the people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, "Wherever there is a worthy one," they carry provisions and rush toward him, inwardly abandoning their kin and outwardly forsaking the affairs of their lords. Their footprints crisscross the borders of the feudal lords, and their carriage tracks entwine a thousand *li* away. This is the fault of those above who esteem knowledge. If those above truly favor knowledge yet lack the Way, the world will fall into great chaos.

How do we know this is so? When the knowledge of bows, crossbows, snares, and cunning traps proliferates, birds are thrown into chaos above. When the knowledge of hooks, bait, nets, and weirs multiplies, fish are thrown into chaos in the water. When the knowledge of fences, traps, nets, and pitfalls abounds, beasts are thrown into chaos in the marshes. When the transformations of cunning deceit, gradual poison, obstinate sophistry, the "hard and white" debate, and the "same and different" distinctions multiply, the common people are bewildered by disputation.

Thus, the world repeatedly falls into great chaos, and the blame lies in the love of knowledge. For the world knows only to seek what it does not know and does not know to seek what it already knows. It knows only to condemn what it deems not good and does not know to condemn what it deems good. This is why great chaos arises. Above, it eclipses the brightness of the sun and moon; below, it scorches the essence of mountains and rivers; in between, it topples the operations of the four seasons. Even the creatures that pant and crawl, the tiny and delicate beings, all lose their nature. How severe is the chaos wrought by the love of knowledge upon the world! This has been the case since the Three Dynasties and after—abandoning the people of simple diversity and delighting in the flattery of the restless, forsaking the serenity of non-action and delighting in the clamor of contention. Such clamor has already thrown the world into chaos!

Guo’s commentary: The people used knotted cords, which sufficed to record essential matters. What was fitting became naturally sweet; what was proper became naturally beautiful. Though the sounds of chickens and dogs carried between them, they did not visit one another—this was the perfection of having no desires. Now, people carry provisions to chase after the worthy, abandoning their kin and forsaking their lords. Even the path to perfect governance has led to such corruption—this is the fault of those above who esteem knowledge. The more meticulously one schemes, the more cunningly one evades. Even birds and beasts cannot be ensnared by knowledge—how much less so for humans! What those above esteem, those below cannot rest content with what little they have. When the few in nature pursue the many, they become lost. Not seeking what they already know but seeking what they do not know—this is to abandon oneself and imitate others, exceeding one’s proper bounds. Praising what one deems good gives rise to competition and striving. Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame arise from action, and the movements of knowledge can truly shake heaven and earth, commanding the lives of all. How can rulers not be wary of their knowledge!

Lü’s commentary: The governance of the sage constantly ensures that the people remain without knowledge and without desire. Without knowledge, they used knotted cords. Without desire, they found sweetness in their food, beauty in their garments, joy in their customs, and contentment in their dwellings, living to old age and dying without visiting one another. This was the age of utmost virtue. When the world all knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When all know goodness as goodness, it is no longer goodness. Knowing to condemn what is not good is to recognize ugliness and non-goodness; not knowing to condemn what one deems good and beautiful is to fail to recognize goodness and beauty. Returning to non-action, even beauty and goodness are not the true nature of life. The people did not visit one another yet formed their own communities—these were the people of simple diversity. Now, wherever there is a worthy one, people carry provisions and rush toward him—this is the flattery of the restless. Their teachings resemble a father’s, their admonitions resemble a son’s—this is the clamor of contention. All this is the fault of esteeming worthies and favoring knowledge. Knowledge gives rise to sages, and sages give rise to great thieves. Sages and great thieves both emerge from knowledge. Thus, this chapter consistently speaks of abandoning knowledge.

Yi Du’s commentary: In the time of the twelve ancient emperors, the people ate without discrimination and found sweetness in their food, wore whatever garments were at hand and found them beautiful, and lived wherever they dwelled, finding contentment in their customs. Though the sounds of chickens and dogs carried between them, they did not visit one another, for people and creatures multiplied without seeking anything from the outside. As the *Laozi* says: "Do not esteem worthies, and the people will not contend." Now, people carry provisions to chase after the worthy, undeterred by distance, their inborn nature corrupted by fame and profit—this is the fault of those above who favor knowledge. From bows and crossbows to the debates of "hard and white" and "same and different," this passage again clarifies the fault of those above who favor knowledge, leading fish, birds, beasts, and humans to all fall into chaos and lose their nature.

What is not known is "knowledge"; what is already known is "innate knowledge." What is not good is not desirable; what one deems good is desirable. Zhuangzi wished for people to forget their external desires, to fill their natural principles, and not to see the goodness of what is desirable. When those above favor knowledge yet lack the Way, they eclipse the brightness of the sun and moon, scorch the essence of mountains and rivers, and topple the operations of the four seasons. Even the smallest creatures and beings lose their nature—from this, the greater can be inferred. The "people of simple diversity" refers to each following the nature they received, their simplicity and purity undispersed. Now, they abandon this simplicity and delight in the restless, forsake serenity and delight in clamor—no wonder the world is thrown into chaos!

A Detailed Annotation on the Dao states: When military commands proliferate, chaos ensues; when words multiply, disputes arise. Thus, the more knowledge one possesses, the more affairs one has; the more affairs one has, the more exhaustion follows—this is why those who govern the world value the abandonment of petty knowledge and the illumination of great knowledge. If one seeks what one does not know yet neglects to seek what one already knows, then in the pursuit of exhaustive understanding, such knowledge becomes superfluous. If one does not reproach what is not evil yet reproaches what one already deems good, then in the fulfillment of inherent nature’s benevolence, one falls short. Deficient in benevolence and burdened with superfluous knowledge, what one knows is not true knowledge, and what one reproaches is not rightly reproached.

The *Heavenly Revolutions* states: The knowledge of the Three Sovereigns above obscured the brightness of the sun and moon, below disrupted the essence of mountains and rivers, and in between toppled the operations of the four seasons. Their knowledge trespassed even the tails of centipedes and the beasts of the wilds, so that none could preserve the integrity of their nature and life—this aligns with the meaning of the preceding passage. The *Commentary* says: "Excessive affairs are the bane of life; excessive speech is the thief of virtue." Restlessness is the mark of excessive affairs; clamor is the mark of excessive speech. How could the world not fall into chaos?

The *Azure Void Annotation* notes: The *Southern Florescence* cites the governance of the ancient Twelve Lords—such as Rongcheng and Datian—who ruled through non-action, to expose the flaws of those who govern in the present age. Knotted cords marked the beginning of legislation, yet affairs cannot remain perpetually still; stillness prolonged gives way to motion, until those above favor knowledge and the world descends into chaos. If even birds, beasts, insects, and fish cannot rest in their existence, how much more so for humans? The poison of cunning and deceit offends the harmony of Heaven, so that grasses, trees, and all crawling creatures suffer its harm.

The *Supreme One* says: "To govern a state with knowledge is the state’s bane; to govern without knowledge is the state’s blessing." How true are these words!

Fuzhai observes: Of the Twelve Lords, only Fuxi, Shennong, and Xuanyuan appear in the classics; the rest remain unrecorded. Some may have been transmitted from ancient traditions, while others may have been invented by Zhuangzi—much like the Buddha’s words: "In some past kalpa..." Viewed within the span of Heaven and Earth, since the time of Fuxi, written records confirm over three thousand years; before Fuxi, there must have been six others, though their names are lost to history. One cannot hastily dismiss their existence. Among those I have encountered, there are worthy men who, carrying provisions, hasten to join them—secretly placing Confucius and Mencius among their ranks. The debates of that era—over "hard and white," "dirt and purity," "same and different"—were the concerns of those who loved to argue. To speak of fishing and hunting alongside such disputation is akin to Zhuangzi’s mockery of Zeng, Shi, and the like alongside measures and scales. Those who seek what they do not know strive outward for novelty; those who seek what they already know find it clear and self-evident, the natural principle. What is deemed unvirtuous in others, what is already virtuous in oneself—this is what the *Discourse on Equalizing Things* means by "affirming what one affirms and negating what one negates." To know only the faults of others while remaining blind to one’s own rightness is itself a fault. From the vast—sun, moon, mountains, and rivers—to the minute—breath, fleeting shadows, and the slightest stirrings—nothing escapes the loss of its true nature. How grave is the chaos wrought by the love of knowledge upon the world!

A sigh concludes the passage, yet it is substantiated by the Three Dynasties. The *Free and Easy Wandering* begins with Tang’s questioning of Ge, while this text ends with "from the Three Dynasties downward"—though their openings and closings differ, they share the same mechanism. This chapter invokes the age of utmost virtue, when above and below sought nothing, and each person was self-sufficient, to contrast with the present. Of the twelve rulers, some remain unrecorded in the annals. From Zhu Rong onward, the records gradually become verifiable, but I surmise that before Fu Xi, the people’s nature was unadorned simplicity, like an unknotted cord. Thus, all they ate was sweet, all they wore was fine; their customs brought joy, their dwellings peace. What did they know of imperial power? Neighboring states were within sight, yet free from fear of raids; the cries of chickens and dogs carried between them, and they enjoyed abundance. People lived and died without visiting one another, tilling and building for their own needs, seeking nothing beyond. These few lines depict the pristine simplicity of high antiquity, further evoking the *Dao De Jing*’s "Small States and Few People" chapter.

Later ages, however, stretch their necks and stand on tiptoe, shoulder their provisions, and rush toward worthies, abandoning their lords and forsaking their kin, traveling a thousand *li* in pursuit. The promotion of worthies spurs the people to seek the strange and strive for the extraordinary, exalting what lies beyond their senses. Inevitably, those whose reputations outstrip their substance respond, leading all to vie in falsity. How could the world not fall into chaos? The following text clarifies how the love of knowledge harms all things, causing the people to lose their nature, so that even birds, beasts, insects, and fish cannot preserve their innate dispositions.

All seek what they do not know—pursuing knowledge beyond their bounds, such as measuring heaven and earth or inquiring into ghosts and spirits. What they already know refers to their innate understanding, discerning the subtle and perilous, honoring virtue and nature. What they deem unvirtuous includes their own faults, which they demand perfection from others to correct. What they deem virtuous includes their own rightness, which they flaunt in self-reliance. If one can discern and follow this with precision, then all goodness arises from authenticity, and each nature returns to its proper state. Without governance, the world governs itself. Should one act contrary to this, the sun, moon, mountains, and rivers grow dim and disordered—how could the people find peace? All this stems from the ruler’s excessive love of knowledge.

The "various peoples" refer to those who preserve the purity of primordial *qi*, fit to be models for the world. This chapter takes *zhen kuang* as its title, a phrase rarely addressed in commentaries. The meaning of *zhen* is uniquely glossed by Lin Yi as "latent opening." Upon consulting the *Jian Yun*, *nao* means "flank," so *zhen kuang* describes reaching into a basket from its side to take what lies within—an act of stealth. The text’s intent is that when governance loses the Way and laws proliferate, the ruler uses knowledge to guard against the people, while the people use knowledge to spy on the ruler. Where defenses are incomplete, they will seize the opportunity to exploit the gap.

Thus, the state’s sharpest instruments must not be displayed to others. Tian Chengzi stole Qi and usurped its sagely wisdom and laws, securing his own safety and making the state hegemonic—proof that even theft has its Way, and that the world’s conventional sagacity and knowledge are unreliable. No wonder these four men could not escape execution!

The world’s paths of good and evil both arise from the Dao of the sages, yet those who do evil are ever many, while those who hasten toward good are ever few. Thus, it is clear that such ways benefit the world little and harm it much. The principle of waxing and waning is like lips and teeth, rivers and valleys—mutually dependent. If sagely knowledge is further imposed upon the world, the advantage it gives to thieves and corrupters will be no small matter.

One forges instruments to level things, yet others steal those very instruments. One establishes laws to govern, yet others steal those very laws. What am I to do?

This truly stems from those who govern failing to magnify the Dao and virtue to make the world’s sentiments impartial. Only then do treacherous heroes seize their power for private gain, and the world suffers harm. The *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi] strives to abolish sagacity and discard knowledge, smash measures and break scales, seeking to restore the governance of non-action from high antiquity. Yet the essence of returning to purity and reverting to simplicity lies in illuminating true knowledge to correct one’s course, and reverting to true goodness to preserve what one has received.

Seeking to rectify the world’s corruptions, its words cannot but verge on excess and reproach, hoping thereby to provoke a turning. The *Horse’s Hoof* [chapter] does not fully convey its metaphor—it reaches its extreme in *Zhen Kuang*. Alas! The Way is vast and difficult to employ; mere empty words are futile. Singing alone in the vanguard, one finds no response—no wonder that from ancient times to now, those who embrace the Dao retreat to mountains and seas, never to return. Alas!

If those entrusted with the governance of the Way were all to apply their minds as did the Master of the Lacquer Garden, how could the world’s Dao fail to flourish? How could its pristine customs fail to return?

*The Ocean of Subtleties in the True Classic of the Southern Florescence*, Scroll Thirty
by Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin

**Chapter One: "In Nurturing"**
We have heard of nurturing the world, never of governing it. To *nurture* (在) is to fear the world’s corruption of its nature; to *accommodate* (宥) is to fear the world’s alteration of its virtue. If the world neither corrupts its nature nor alters its virtue, can there be any who govern it?

In ancient times, when Yao governed the world, he made its people joyful in their natures—this was not tranquility. When Jie governed the world, he made its people weary in their natures—this was not contentment. That which is neither tranquil nor content is not virtue. And that which is not virtue cannot long endure—nowhere in the world does such a thing exist.

When people are excessively joyful, they incline toward yang; when excessively angry, they incline toward yin. When yin and yang are both imbalanced, the four seasons fail to arrive, the harmony of cold and heat is not achieved, and in the end, this harms the human form. If people’s joy and anger lose their proper place, if their dwellings lack constancy, if their thoughts and reflections find no ease, if the Way of the center fails to take shape—then the world begins to produce those who are haughty, contentious, arrogant, and startled, and only afterward do the conducts of Robber Zhi, Zeng, and Shi arise.

To reward all the world’s goodness would be insufficient; to punish all the world’s evil would be inadequate. Thus, the world’s vastness is not enough for reward and punishment. Since the Three Dynasties, rulers have clamored endlessly over reward and punishment—when do they have leisure to settle into the true condition of their natures and lives?

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
To accommodate and let be is to govern; to govern is to create chaos. If nothing sways them, natures and lives remain unharmed, and desires and aversions do not err. But those above cannot practice non-action, so they introduce allurements and preferences, and the people’s natures become corrupted. What is prized in a sage-king is not his ability to govern, but his capacity for non-action, allowing things to act of themselves. Without governance, there is no alteration or corruption.

Though Yao nurtured the world, his advancement was still governance. Though governance and chaos differ, both lose the tranquility and contentment of later ages, causing things to vie for esteem and fear contempt, never finding ease—this they share. Joy and anger losing their place, dwellings lacking constancy—these are the results of rulers like Yao and Jie. Humans, within heaven and earth, are most capable of using their numinous awareness to stir joy and anger, disturbing life and disrupting yin and yang.

Thus, between gain and loss, joy and anger gather in the hearts of the people, the harmony of cold and heat is destroyed, the seasons’ rhythms go awry, the hundred norms fall into confusion, and the myriad affairs wither and collapse. To admire reward is to seek goodness, yet reward cannot suffice. To fear punishment is to cease evil, yet punishment cannot prevail. Forget reward and punishment, and let goodness arise of itself—only then are natures and lives fully realized!

Reward and punishment are how sage-kings respond to merit and fault; they are not meant to establish incentives or deterrents. Thus, when governance reaches its perfection, they are set aside. Yet since the Three Dynasties, rulers have clamored and competed, making what should be incidental their primary concern—when do they have leisure to settle into the true condition of their natures and lives?

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:**
The world is the unity of the myriad things; its constant nature and constant virtue are none other than our own nature and virtue. To nurture and accommodate the world is to nurture and accommodate ourselves. To *nurture* (在) is to preserve without loss, to follow nature without addition. To *accommodate* (宥) is to release without indulgence, like a park that accommodates its creatures. Without corruption or alteration, there is only non-action; with non-action, there is no self. If there is no self, then who governs the world? Thus, one forgets the right and wrong of Yao and Jie.

Humans are born tranquil—what joy or suffering is there? To impose joy or suffering is to corrupt their nature; to corrupt their nature is to alter their virtue. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, with harmonizing qi as their balance. Humans all possess this harmonizing qi, through which they commune with heaven and earth. Yet Yao made the people joyful in their natures, leading to excessive joy and an imbalance toward yang; Jie made the people suffer in their natures, leading to excessive anger and an imbalance toward yin. Thus, their harmonizing qi was harmed, the seasons’ unfolding was disrupted, the harmony of cold and heat was not achieved, and in the end, the human form was injured.

Thoughts and reflections finding no ease, the Way of the center failing to take shape—this is what is meant by mutual harm. Then the world begins to produce conduct that is haughty, contentious, arrogant, and startled—conduct that is extreme. Haughtiness exalts height; contention exhausts all; arrogance is unattainable; startlement is unbalanced—none of this is level, easy, centered, or upright. This is why reward and punishment cannot suffice, and why the true condition of natures and lives cannot find peace.

**Lin Yidu’s Commentary:**
All that the world generates of itself is self-existent; all that it attains of itself is self-accommodating. The sage observes the world’s self-existent nature and nurtures it, allowing each to wander in carefree ease. He follows the world’s self-accommodating virtue and accommodates it, allowing each to rest in the joy of its principle. To nurture is to allow the world to fulfill its nature; to accommodate is to allow the world to follow its virtue. Thus, natures are not corrupted, virtues are not altered, and the sage, too, practices non-action. How could there be anyone who governs the world?

A mind untroubled is called *tranquility* (恬), which carries the sense of peace and stillness. A mind that flows in accord is called *contentment* (愉), which carries the sense of joy and delight. Joy scatters the qi and stirs the mind, so it is not tranquil. Anger reverses the qi and oppresses the mind, so it is not content. The human mind is never not empty, yet when it reaches sorrow or joy, something has touched it.

Though Yao and Jie governed the world differently in good and evil, their touching of the human mind and harming of nature were the same—this was not the principle of the self-attained kings of old.

Can this endure for long? When joy is excessive, the yang qi is constantly dispersed; when anger is excessive, the yin qi is perpetually oppressed. Joy and anger arise from the ruler’s governance losing the mean, causing the people’s minds to lose their proper measure. This offends the harmony of Heaven and Earth and in turn harms the human form—such is the principle of mutual consequence.

Thus, people’s thoughts and deliberations fail to find their own fulfillment, and their way in life never reaches completion. All describe the state of the human form being harmed and yin and yang falling out of harmony. *Qiao gu* speaks with lofty pretension; *zhuo jing* acts with extraordinary strangeness. Because of Yao’s path, Zeng and Shi emerged; because of Jie’s ways, thieves and destroyers arose. Having praised Yao and condemned Jie, with good and evil intermingled, even exhausting all things under Heaven would not suffice for rewards and punishments—how much less for anything else? If those above make rewards and punishments their constant concern, how can the people of the world ever rest in the natural truth of their natures and lives?

Chen Xiangdao’s commentary: Those who hold the world desire to open Heaven but not to open man, to bring fortune but not to bring harm—nothing surpasses *zai* and *you*. In *zai*, nothing disturbs; in *you*, nothing oppresses. With no disturbance, natures are not corrupted, so all things grow spontaneously without knowing why they grow. With no oppression, virtues are not altered, so all things attain their due without knowing why they attain it. Who then governs the world?

Those who govern the world err either in failing to be tranquil or in failing to be content. Without tranquility, there is excessive joy that leans toward yang; without contentment, there is excessive anger that leans toward yin. Thus, the qi of the human body flows in communion with Heaven and Earth, and the yin and yang of the five phases lean toward the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth. Corresponding to this, the harmony of cold and heat is not achieved, and instead the human form is harmed. From this, those who seek lofty heights, plumb profound depths, prize the strange, or pursue the swift emerge—none follow the central way. If they do not exceed in doing good, they must exceed in doing evil. Thus, even all under Heaven is insufficient for rewards and punishments—how could they ever rest in the natural truth of their natures and lives?

Chen Bixu’s commentary: The rulers of high antiquity who preserved the world did so by being magnanimous—it was not that they had some intention to govern it. Thus, the world did not corrupt its natures or alter its virtues, and so it was self-governing through non-action. In former times, Yao lost the way of preserving the self and practiced benevolence and love, causing the people to lose their constant nature and come to cherish and praise him. Jie lacked the grace of magnanimity toward things and pursued harsh urgency, causing the people to lose their constant virtue and come to fear and despise him. Where natures are corrupted and virtues altered, there has never been one who did not perish. Human joy and anger connect to yin and yang; when yin and yang are not in harmony, the human form is harmed in return. *Qiao gu* refers to lofty and strange theories, likening them to the likes of Zeng and Shi. *Zhuo jing* refers to solitary, fierce conduct, comparing it to the followers of Robber Zhi. Rewards for good are insufficient—this shows how many feign goodness. Punishments for evil are inadequate—this shows how much true evil there is.

Thus, with clamor and competitive pursuit, making power and profit their sole concern—how could they ever find leisure for tranquil joy and long life? As the *Yongzhai Oral Teachings* of the Lin family states: *"In"* means to roam freely at ease; *"you"* means to be magnanimous and self-content. If the people of the world all kept their natures uncorrupted and their virtues unaltered, what need would there be to govern them?

*Tian* means stillness; *yu* means joy. Joy pertains to yang; anger pertains to yin. *Pi* means to augment—what medical texts call an "excess disorder." Attaining the center and harmony, Heaven and Earth take their proper places; losing the center and harmony, the four seasons fall into disorder, and people likewise fall ill. "Dwelling without constancy" refers to reckless action; "failing to form a pattern" means losing the central Way. *Qiao* describes those who love loftiness to excess; *gu* refers to contentious debate. *Zhuo* means isolation; *jing* means fierce intensity—all expressions of disharmony. Zeng, Shi, and Robber Zhi merely stand in for the worthy and the unworthy. When the mind is not in harmony, neither the worthy nor the unworthy are genuine.

Now, when the worthy are rewarded and the unworthy punished, those who sell themselves as worthy are not truly so—this is the case throughout the world. Thus, rewards prove insufficient, for such people are many. As all seek reward and shun punishment, they engage in pretense with one another—how could they ever rest in the natural principles of their natures and lives? *"In"* means merely to preserve, to possess the world without entanglement. *"You"* means to show compassion and care, thus regarding the people as though wounded.

Therefore, the sagely ruler sits upright in the ancestral hall, while the hundred clans find tranquil joy in their fields and furrows. Natures remain uncorrupted, virtues unaltered; forms and voices harmonize, and Heaven and Earth respond—this was the perfect governance of high antiquity. From the Three Dynasties onward, rulers clamored to make reward and punishment their business, leaving the people no way to rest in the truth of their natures and lives. By the Warring States period, there were even those who could not be encouraged by reward or deterred by punishment.

Zhuangzi’s doctrine of *"in"* and *"you"*—was it not the work of one who sought to restore antiquity? In the course of human life, daily contact with things brings encounters with both adversity and favor. Joy and anger cannot be entirely forgotten; the key lies in regulating them appropriately, expressing them in due measure, and never losing harmony. If joy or anger becomes excessive, leaning toward yin or yang, then cold and heat lose their proper order—how much more so for people?

Tracing the source of such excess, it stems from the governance of Yao and Jie: one made the people joyful, the other made them weary—thus arose the origins of joy and anger. From this, good and evil became manifest, rewards and punishments were established, and the world began to exalt lofty conduct, exhaust itself in contentious speech, and display solitary fierceness and startling boldness in action. The good became like Zeng and Shi; the evil, like Jie and Zhi. The whole world proved insufficient for encouragement or deterrence—how could they ever rest in their natures and lives? Those who wielded the Way of governance had nowhere left to apply their methods.

Yet the recluses of rivers and seas, mountains and forests, still held fast to this concern, hoping to find a remedy and restore health. Though their words may seem strange, their hearts were those of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor—how could one dismiss them as mere eccentricities? Moreover, to delight in cleverness—is this not indulgence in sensuality?

To delight in keen hearing—is this not indulgence in sound? To delight in benevolence—is this not disorder in virtue? To delight in righteousness—is this not perversion of principle? To delight in ritual—is this not mere performance of technique? To delight in music—is this not mere indulgence in excess? To delight in sagacity—is this not mere display of artifice? To delight in knowledge—is this not mere attachment to flaws?

When the world seeks to rest in the true nature of its lives, these eight may be present or absent—it matters not. But when the world cannot rest in the true nature of its lives, these eight become like severed fragments, coiled restraints, heaped clutter, and knotted tangles, throwing all into chaos. Yet the world still venerates and cherishes them—how deeply deluded it is! Is it merely a matter of recognizing error and abandoning them? Instead, they fast and purify themselves to speak of them, kneel and sit to present them, drum and sing to mourn them—what can I do about this?

Thus, when the noble person is compelled to govern the world, nothing is better than non-action. Through non-action, the true nature of life finds rest. Therefore, one who values their own person above governing the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their own person above governing the world may be charged with the world.

If the noble person can refrain from loosening their five viscera, refrain from flaunting their keen perception, dwell in stillness yet manifest like a dragon, remain deep in silence yet resound like thunder, move with spirit and the heavens follow, act with ease and non-action so that the myriad things rise and accumulate—then what leisure do I have to govern the world?

Guo Xiang’s commentary: When one accords with principle, there is no delight; to delight is to invite excess and perversion. Whether these eight exist or not, one should follow their allotted portion, and the nature of life will find peace. Yet if these eight are retained, one cannot fully follow nature, and thus they become like crude restraints and tangled knots. To fail to abandon them is already an error, yet to venerate them—how could this not be profound delusion? It is not merely a matter of passing them by; instead, they are treasured and exalted in this way.

Moreover, non-action does not mean mere silent inaction; when each follows its natural course, the nature of life finds rest. "Compelled" does not mean forced by threats or punishments; it means embracing the Dao and holding to simplicity, acting in accord with the utmost spontaneity, so that the world naturally submits. Thus, whether one enters or withdraws, speaks or remains silent, one leaves it to the unconcerned mind. The spirit moves in response to things, and the heavens follow principle in their course—like dust stirred by the wind, all is left to its own nature.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: When the world cannot rest in the true nature of its lives, what is called keen perception, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, sagacity, and knowledge are all not in their proper state, inevitably leading to disorder in virtue and perversion of principle. Whether these eight exist or not, it makes no difference to their fundamental truth. *Hóng* means to sever and leave incomplete; *juǎn*, to bind and leave constrained; *cāng*, to accumulate and leave undispersed; *náng*, to knot and leave unresolved. All these bring chaos to the world, yet they are still venerated and cherished, spoken of with fasting and purification, danced to with drums and song—believing these to be the world’s ultimate truth. The world has been deluded for so long—what can I do about it?

When governing the world, if one truly acts out of necessity and practices non-action, why would I not value and cherish my own person above governing the world, offering myself for its sake? Only then can one be entrusted or charged with the world. To value is not to treat one’s person lightly; to cherish is not to endanger one’s person. Entrustment is like entrusting one’s body; charge is like entrusting an object. Thus, valuing is weightier than cherishing, and entrustment is weightier than charge.

If the five viscera are not loosened, one does not scatter and indulge in benevolence and righteousness. If keen perception is not flaunted, one does not extend and attach to sounds and sights. To dwell in stillness yet manifest like a dragon means that manifestation arises from non-action. To remain deep in silence yet resound like thunder means that sound arises from not speaking. When the spirit moves, response follows; when the heavens follow, they come unbidden. Thus, with ease and non-action, the myriad things rise and accumulate—like breath piling upon breath, like dust gathering of its own accord. What leisure then is there to govern the world?

Lin Yidu’s commentary: Benevolence and righteousness are the substance of ritual and music; ritual and music are the adornment of benevolence and righteousness. When one fills the inner self from one’s nature, one becomes one with the Dao; when one seeks externally through keen perception, one departs from the Dao and pursues mere names. If the world could rest in the nature of life that resides within, then these eight—whether present or absent—could establish human virtue or the Dao of heaven. But if one chases names and pursues fame, these eight become severed fragments, coiled restraints, heaped clutter, and knotted tangles, throwing the world into chaos. This describes their obstructive and inflexible nature. Yet the world still venerates and cherishes them, fasting and purifying to speak of them, mourning them with drums and song—depicting the extent of their reverence. What can I do about it?

When the noble person, to whom the world turns, is compelled to govern, nothing is better than non-action. Through non-action, there is nothing that is not done. Non-action is for governing oneself; nothing not done is for responding to things. The Dao of Yao and Shun did not go beyond this. When the sage enters and harmonizes with heaven, they neither value nor cherish the world, nor do they recognize what is venerable or intimate—thus, there is nothing to entrust or charge. But when they emerge and engage with humanity, only then do they value and cherish the world, recognizing what is venerable—thus, they entrust it. Recognizing what is intimate—thus, they charge it.

Without valuing or cherishing, one merges with the spirit; with valuing and cherishing, one resides in the body. The body is where the spirit is entrusted; the world is entrusted to one’s body; one’s body is entrusted to heaven and earth; heaven and earth are entrusted to the void. Considering this, all that has form cannot escape having something to entrust. As the *Laozi* says: "One who values their own person above governing the world may be charged with the world; one who cherishes their own person above governing the world may be entrusted with the world." The meaning is the same, though the words differ. It speaks of those who have the intent to govern but have not yet attained it, as if there were an intention but not yet its realization. The *Laozi* speaks of those who already govern the world, while Zhuangzi speaks of those who have not yet governed.

Those who "may" are those who, having already gained the world, keep their hearts unattached to it—such were the ancients like Yao and Shun. Those who "can" are those who, not yet having gained the world, do not forget it in their hearts—such were the ancients like Confucius and Mencius. Each has its own focus. If one dissects the five viscera, spirit, essence, hun-soul, and po-soul scatter and are no longer whole; if one plucks out one’s keen hearing and sharp sight, ears, eyes, nose, and mouth follow their forms and do not return. How could this be the Dao of the noble person’s cultivation of the heart and nurturing of nature?

Thus, in stillness, one is like a corpse; in appearance, like a dragon; in silence, like an abyss; in speech, like thunder. These four all arise from non-intention, merely responding to the moment and following principle. Movement is like the spirit’s response to things; conduct is like heaven’s compliance with the seasons. Only thus can one be at ease and practice non-action, while the myriad things steam and pile up like motes of dust moving on their own—what have I to do with them?

Chen Xiangdao’s note: Regarding keen hearing, sagely wisdom, benevolence and righteousness, ritual and music in relation to the world—did the sages ever force themselves to act? All was but a response to the moment, an adaptation to change, an unavoidable necessity. The benighted cling to straw dogs as divine, point to thatched huts as sacred dwellings, and not only pass them by in error but even speak of them with reverence, drum and sing in unison—with such ways, how can the world not be deluded?

To value one’s person *in* governing the world is to regard governing the world as less weighty than one’s own person; to cherish one’s person *in* governing the world is to regard governing the world as less intimate than one’s own person. This is to forget the world. To value one’s person *for* the world and to cherish one’s person *for* the world is not to forget the world. To forget the world is merely to suit oneself; not to forget the world is to have something with which to suit others. Yet in neither case has one transcended the self.

The *Laozi* says: "Life cannot be preserved by valuing it; the person cannot be enriched by cherishing it." Then what value or cherishing can there be for one who has no self? To value and cherish one’s person, though inferior to the sages, is still what the world wishes for in a ruler—thus one may be entrusted with the world.

Yet the *Laozi* speaks of valuing one’s person as "may be charged" and cherishing one’s person as "may be entrusted." "Can" is a definitive term; "may" is a tentative one. To be charged is to receive what is entrusted; to be entrusted is to rely on what is depended upon. In terms of forgetting the world versus not forgetting it, the distinction between "can" and "may" becomes clear. As for the discourse on being charged and entrusted, it should follow the *Laozi* as the standard.

Without unraveling the true treasury, the Dao and its power are not diverted onto the byways of benevolence and righteousness; without plucking out keen hearing and sharp sight, ears and eyes are not submerged in the falsity of sounds and colors. To dwell like a corpse is to be without affairs; to appear like a dragon is to bring forth affairs—yet in having no affairs, one has never begun to have them. To be silent like an abyss is to not speak; to speak like thunder is to bring forth words—yet in not speaking, one has never begun to speak. Thus, one moves in accord with things, and such movement is not by the heart but by the spirit; one acts in accord with principle, and such action is not by heaven but by the human. At ease and practicing non-action, the myriad things steam and pile up as if within an abandoned bellows—what leisure is there to govern the world?

Chen Bixu’s note: Withdrawing sight and hearing inward, sounds and colors cannot delude. Concealing benevolence and righteousness within, how can the Dao and its power be lost? Restraining ritual and music in the person, falsity and deceit cannot intrude. Cutting off the pursuit of sagely wisdom, flaws and maladies cannot assail. These eight were what the ancients rolled up to cultivate the self; in later ages, they were spread out to lose the root. The southerners rolled up what was difficult to roll; the northerners confused what was easy to contain—speaking of the difficulty of rolling up and concealing, it must lead to disordering the world. The world does not value simplicity and ease but instead reveres and clings to complexity and difficulty—how deluded it is!

Thus, in facing the world, nothing is better than non-action. With non-action, the natural tendencies of life and destiny are never disturbed. To value and cherish one’s person *in* governing the world is to value and cherish the world, not one’s own person. If so, gain and loss are not one’s own, and sorrow and joy are not for oneself—thus one may be entrusted with the world.

The corpse does not speak yet is solemn and orderly; the dragon transforms and becomes manifest. The Dao and nature are true and constant, like an abyss’s still silence; commands and orders respond to the moment, like thunder’s issuing sound. The spirit moves within, and its image appears without. Abiding in magnanimity and self-possession, one responds to things and rises in action. Though it is said that one does not govern the world, the method of governance resides therein.

Lin’s *Yongzhai Oral Exegesis* states: The "sageliness" in "delighting in sageliness" is akin to the *-able* suffix, much like "calligraphy sage" (grass sage); thus even thieves may be called "sages." None of these can be explained by the lexical meanings of the *Analects* or *Mencius*. If one rests in naturalness, these eight—though present—cannot become burdens.

"Barbarian scrolls" connote constraint; "rustic sacks," meddlesomeness. "Fasting and vigil," "kneeling and sitting" speak of solemn reverence. "Drumming and singing in unison" refers to unawareness of hand-dancing and foot-stomping—this mocks the scholars of the time. "I" refers to others: *You all act thus—what then is to be done?*

The passage beginning with "of necessity" expounds the governance of non-action and naturalness; these three characters alone reveal the meaning of "possessing the world yet not engaging with it." Only when one values one’s person *as* more precious than governing the world can the world be entrusted to them; only when one cherishes one’s person *as* more beloved than governing the world can the world be confided to them. These two lines are textually striking yet principledly sound.

The *Record of Rites* states: "the binding of sinews and bones." To "unbind the five viscera" is to cease such binding. "Plucking" means overusing one’s intelligence. "Corpse-like abiding" refers to the *Rites’* dictum: "sit like a corpse." The "dragon" is a metaphor for literary brilliance, its majestic demeanor a model to emulate. "Abyssal silence" denotes profound stillness without speech; "thunderous sound," the power to move others. As Chan Buddhism says: *Though silent, its voice is like thunder.* When the spirit stirs within, heaven follows without—every movement and gesture, every turn and pause, is nothing but the principle of heaven. These three lines are both profoundly reasoned and textually striking.

"All things steam and pile up"—this is like all things breathing upon one another, meaning that if I but practice non-action above, the people will naturally act and rest like floating dust in the wind. Why then should one trouble the heart to govern them? The eight—intelligence, discernment, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, sageliness, and wisdom—though products of human effort, each contains its own natural principle. Simply enact what is effortless.

Their absence is no loss; their presence, no gain. If the heart clings to delight in them, stagnation arises and harm ensues—far worse than mere injury. Enacting what is effortless, one rests in the natural tendencies of life and destiny. Stagnation and obstruction breed harm, leading to constraint, meddlesomeness, and the disordering of the world. Galloping with intelligence, sageliness, and wisdom, a single person entangled at the top—how can the world hope for peace? Yet the world still admires and venerates them.

Expounding with fasting and vigil lends gravity to their words; advancing with kneeling and sitting lends weight to their transmission. As for drumming and singing in unison, they indulge in it without end. Their delusion is beyond remedy—what can I do about this? This is an emphatic lament.

When necessity compels one to act, movement follows only under duress. Nothing compares to non-action, allowing things to follow their nature. Thus, one who values their person for the sake of the world does not demean its people; one who cherishes their person for the sake of the world can draw close to its people. Only then may the world be entrusted to them. In such entrustment, the patterns interweave without distinction of weight or lightness.

Dissolve not the five viscera; gather the five constants and return them to the Dao. Do not exalt cleverness; efface sound and color to preserve one’s authenticity. Therefore, one skilled in emergence acts in accord with the moment, and their emergence is spirit-like. One skilled in stillness speaks in accord with the moment, and their utterance is grand. All arises from the work of self-cultivation aligning with the movement of supreme spirit—even heaven does not oppose it, let alone humankind.

At ease in non-action, I attain fulfillment; the myriad things rise and fall, each attaining fulfillment. When both things and self attain fulfillment, the world is governed—what leisure remains to govern the world?

The two characters *cāngnáng* have been variously glossed as "disorder," but without phonetic clarification. According to Mao Huang’s *Zeng Yun*, *náng* is appended to the entry for *zhēng* (狞), citing *Zhuangzi* as a note. Further examination of the *Book of Han* (section on Jia Yi’s biography) reads: "The state’s system is *qiǎngrǎng* (抢攘)," where the upper character is pronounced *cāng* (仕庚切) and the lower *náng* (女庚切), both meaning "disorder." Judging by this classical text, the old gloss of *cāngnáng* as "disorder" should align with the *Book of Han*’s *qiǎngrǎng* in sound and meaning.

**Chapter Two: In Indulgence**

Cui Qu asked Lao Dan, “If one does not govern the world, how can the human heart be settled?”
Lao Dan replied, “Take heed! Do not disturb the human heart. The human heart, when pressed, sinks low; when urged, rises high. Low and high, it is imprisoned and slain. Supple and yielding, it yet overcomes the hard and strong. Sharp and carving, it is hewn and polished. In its heat, it burns like fire; in its cold, it congeals like ice. Swift as a glance, it twice strokes the lands beyond the four seas. At rest, it is deep and still; in motion, it soars to the heavens. Fierce and proud, it cannot be bound—is this not the human heart?

In former times, the Yellow Emperor first disturbed the human heart with benevolence and righteousness. Yao and Shun, thereupon, wore their thighs bare and their shins hairless, to nourish the forms of the world. They wearied their five viscera for benevolence and righteousness, strained their blood and qi to model laws and measures. Yet still they could not prevail. Yao then banished Gun to Mount Chong, exiled the Three Miao to Sanwei, and sent Gonggong into exile at Youdu—this was his failure to master the world. By the time of the Three Kings, the world was greatly alarmed. Below were Jie and Zhi; above were Zeng and Shi; and the Confucians and Mohists all arose. Thereupon, joy and anger suspected one another, the foolish and the wise deceived one another, the good and the bad reviled one another, the extravagant and the truthful mocked one another—and the world declined. Great virtue diverged, and the nature and destiny of life dissolved. The world prized knowledge, and the common people exhausted themselves in pursuit. Then saws and axes were fashioned, inked cords and chisels were wielded. The world was utterly disordered—all because the human heart was disturbed. Thus, the worthy concealed themselves beneath the great mountains and lofty crags, while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled in fear within their ancestral halls.

In this age, those condemned to death lie heaped upon one another; those in cangues and stocks jostle one another; those executed or punished are seen everywhere. Yet the Confucians and Mohists still lift their skirts and bare their arms among the stocks and pillories. Alas! How extreme is their shamelessness, their utter lack of remorse! I know not whether sagely wisdom does not become the saw and cangue that break men’s limbs, or whether benevolence and righteousness do not become the stocks and pillories that pierce men’s flesh. How can we know that Zeng and Shi are not the arrows and pellets of Jie and Zhi? Therefore it is said: ‘Abandon sageliness, discard wisdom, and the world will be greatly ordered.’”

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
Pressed, it sinks; urged, it rises—this speaks of its ease of agitation. Burning fire and congealing ice arise from the accumulation of joy and anger. If it is neither carved nor polished, preserving its original simplicity, how could there be ice and fire? In the space between a glance and a nod, it twice strokes the four seas—this is the movement of customs. At rest, it may be made as still as an abyss; in motion, it leaps bound to the heavens. The transformations of the human heart are without limit. Left to itself and released, it is still and naturally penetrates; governed and bound, it stumbles and grows fierce and proud. Fierce and proud—this is an uncontrollable force.

The Yellow Emperor did not act for benevolence and righteousness; when he merged with things, the traces of benevolence and righteousness appeared. Once these traces appeared, the world necessarily followed them—this is what disturbs things. As for the reputations of Yao and Shun, these are but advances. I lodge in this advance, but the advance is not I—thus, the alarmed are of the world. The more the world is alarmed, the more the advance grows coarse. Coarseness and subtlety are like the level and perilous paths—does the traveler ever change his feet? The sage is one, yet there are differences among Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu. What differs are the names of the times and ages, which are insufficient to name the reality of the sage. Though there are the thoroughfares of benevolence and righteousness, what passes through remains whole.

From the mutual suspicion of joy and anger to the mutual mockery of extravagance and truth, none can be equal in self-attainment. Establishing minor differences without ceasing to divide, knowing no bounds yet prizing knowledge—thus, there is nothing to satisfy their demands. Hence the calamity of saws, axes, chisels, and mallets, and the carving of nature and destiny to this extremity. If one follows nature and dwells in what is fitting, then the worthy and the foolish follow their natures, the noble and the base tread their stations, and ruler and minister, high and low, all attain their utmost—there will be no trouble in the world. This advance disturbs the hearts of the world, setting them galloping without cease. Hating the upright and reviling the correct, factions draw one another on. Those who follow their true nature lose their ground; those who practice falsity usurp their handles. Thus, rulers worry above, and the people suffer below—all from the rotten Confucians clinging to their advances. Not considering the abandonment of advances to return to unity, they instead bare their arms and employ advances to govern advances—truly, they are without shame!

The cangue and stocks use the joining of planks as their mechanism; the stocks and pillories use the piercing of handles as their function. Sagely wisdom and benevolent righteousness are the advances that distance one from crime. When the people esteem these advances, hypocrisy arises. Where hypocrisy arises, and the tools to defend against insult are lacking—this has never been.

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:**
To indulge and not govern is how one does not disturb the human heart; to govern and confuse it is to disturb it. Pressed, it sinks; urged, it rises—none know its direction. Low and high, it is imprisoned and slain. To its cold congealing like ice—this is not what should be disturbed. In the space between a glance and a nod, it twice strokes the four seas—its comings and goings are without time. At rest, it is deep and still; in motion, it hangs from the heavens. Fierce and proud, it cannot be bound—this is what is called grasping what is preserved and abandoning what is lost.

The True Man feared that scholars would simply take Yao and Shun as not having attained the Way, so he further spoke of the Yellow Emperor disturbing the human heart with benevolence and righteousness. His aim was to abandon sageliness and discard wisdom—it was not that these men were inherently different. Without abandoning sageliness and wisdom, one cannot be without them. To disturb the human heart with benevolence and righteousness is because one has a heart. Having a heart, one has proximity, and cannot avoid sacrificing oneself for the world, leading to what is called “fierce virtue” and its abandonment.

From “wore their thighs bare” to “model laws and measures”—this is sacrificing oneself for the world, yet still unable to prevail, because one cannot abandon sageliness and discard wisdom. Extending to the Three Kings, below were Jie and Zhi’s extreme violence, above were Zeng and Shi’s excessive goodness, and the Confucians and Mohists all arose, mutually suspecting and deceiving one another. None attained the perfect correctness of the world, so the nature and destiny of life dissolved, and the common people exhausted themselves in pursuit. Thus, the calamity of saws, axes, chisels, and mallets arose inevitably.

Thus, the worthy withdraw and conceal themselves to avoid calamity, while the lords of ten thousand chariots tremble with anxiety yet remain unaware. The method for addressing this—simply because one cannot embody non-action—is nothing more than returning to the natural state of one’s nature and destiny.

In the present age, executions and punishments fill the land in an unbroken succession, far exceeding those of the Three Dynasties. Yet the Confucians and Mohists still sit cross-legged and roll up their sleeves among the condemned, eager to debate with them—this is the height of shamelessness!

If one now seeks to remedy this but does not return to the natural state of nature and destiny, and instead piles on sageliness, wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness, it is like fleeing from Heaven’s punishment only to tighten one’s bonds further, making them insoluble. It is to heap advantage upon Jie and Zhi, allowing them to set the precedent and be followed.

Lin Yi’s sole annotation: Those who advance upward crave elevation; those who push down rush toward baseness. Each is bound by their own constraints—this is how they become imprisoned and destroyed.

Graceful softness contends with hardness and strength; this is how *kangju* loses its authenticity. Carving and polishing damage simplicity. What is called “order” is in truth a means of provocation and disruption. Thus arises the stifling of yin and yang.

"Scorching fire congeals ice"—this expresses the idea that agitation overcomes cold, while stillness overcomes heat. In Ni Yang’s inquiry, to "caress the Four Seas twice" speaks of gaining the world in the span of a dream, like the events of *Nanke* in the pillow. "Abyssal stillness" means profound silence. "Suspended from Heaven" implies lofty and distant connections. "Frenzied arrogance" describes unbridled indulgence, akin to the metaphor of the "monkey-mind" and "horse-will."

The Dao began with Fuxi, became more pronounced under Yao and Shun, and then strayed from the Huangdi’s path, practiced to the point of emaciation without limbs, baldness without hair—merely nurturing the world’s form while failing to pacify its nature. They tormented their five organs for the sake of benevolence and righteousness, stiffened their blood and qi to model laws and standards, causing yin and yang to wage war within a single body. How could they find peace in nature and destiny? If nature and destiny are not at peace, how can they overcome the world’s deceptions and artifices? Thus arose the affairs of exile and banishment.

By the time of the Three Kings, the laws had grown ever more enduring, yet their flaws ever more glaring. Hence arose the divisions of Jie, Zhì, Zeng, and Shi; the rivalries of the Ru and Mohists; mutual suspicion and deceit. The pure wind was lost, and the world declined. Nature and destiny lay in ruins, and the people were exhausted. The "new saw" is a metaphor for benevolence and righteousness; the "inked line," for ritual and law; the "hammer and chisel," for punishments and statutes. All are tools that chafe against the human heart. Thus the world fell into great chaos, and even the lords of ten thousand chariots could not secure their thrones.

Amidst the carnage where the executed lie in sight of one another, their mutilated forms bearing witness to the multitude of the imprisoned and slain, the Ru and Mohists still cling to the fragments of benevolence and righteousness, leaping and gesticulating amidst the chaos, seeking some means to salvage the situation—this is ignorance of the root. For to govern the near by recounting the past is like quenching fire with fire: can it ever succeed?

*Jiezhe* are crossbeams, as *Huainanzi* states: "The large are pillars and beams; the small, *jiezhe*." *Zaobing* are chisel handles, where the wood is shaped like the head of a pillar. The whistling of the *haoshi* arrow. *Hengyang* (pillories and cangues) are completed only after the *jiezhe* are joined; the *zhi* and *jie* (fetters and stocks) are established only after the *zaobing* are fashioned. Those who would employ sagely wisdom and benevolence seek to keep the people far from crime. Yet when the people are ever advancing, deceit and artifice arise, and the *hengyang* and *jiezhe* are thus made ready.

Only by removing that which chafes against the human heart can the world be governed.

Chen Xiangdao’s commentary: *Mencius* speaks of the human heart, saying, "Hold fast to it, and it remains; let it go, and it is lost." *Zhuangzi* speaks of the human heart, saying, "It is proud and restless, and cannot be bound." To hold fast without letting go is the way of man; to release without binding is the way of Heaven. Those who govern must not discard Heaven for man, nor should scholars discard man for Heaven. To discard Heaven for man is not the way to grant freedom; to discard man for Heaven is not the way to nurture and fill.

When the human heart is pressed downward, it is confined as in a prison; when driven upward, it rages and kills. To wound and maim it, leaving it broken and incomplete; to carve and polish it, rendering it ornate yet hollow—thus the qi of yin and yang is scattered. When it lies still, it is sullen; when it rises, it is haughty. To grasp and bind it, forcing it to close and not expand, is to invite the response of an unworthy heart.

The Seven Virtues are internal, hence they distress the five viscera. Laws and statutes are external, hence they constrain the blood and qi. Yet when transformative virtue is practiced, deceit and falsehood arise; when laws and statutes are made manifest, violence and disorder erupt. Even in Yao’s age of perfect governance, the Four Fiends could not escape punishment—how much less so in the ages that followed the Three Dynasties?

Jie and Zhòu, though noble as Sons of Heaven, committed acts even the lowliest servant would not; Kong and Mo, though impoverished commoners, were feared by the highest ministers. The distinction between noble and base lies in conduct, not in rank—hence it is said that below there are Jie and Zhì, while above there are Zeng and Shi. Mutual suspicion and deceit led to utter chaos: this is the inner punishment. The carnage of *shusi* and the implements of *hengyang* are the outer punishments. When outer constraints are imposed, inner punishments follow; when inner punishments arise, outer punishments are enacted. Thus the Ru and Mohists emerged, and the world fell into chaos, after which executions and mutilations stretched as far as the eye could see. *Shu* means to sever; *lu* means to disgrace.

*Jiezhe* are the beams of *hengyang*; *jiezhe* are not *hengyang*, yet *hengyang* are completed only through *jiezhe*. *Zaobing* are not the *zhi* and *jie* of the stocks, yet the stocks are formed only through *zaobing*. Sagely wisdom and the Seven Virtues are not crimes and evils, yet crimes and evils arise only through sagely wisdom and the Seven Virtues. Thus sagely wisdom is likened to *jiezhe*, and transformative virtue to *zaobing*.

Bixu’s commentary: The human heart is originally still; when stirred, it becomes chaotic. To *pai* is to destroy it; to *jin* is to praise it. Scorching heat without, freezing cold within—once the machinations of the heart are set in motion, they pervade the empty expanse, and the heart’s habitual tendencies, once unleashed, run wilder than a galloping horse.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor first employed benevolence and righteousness to ensnare the human heart. Yao and Shun toiled and suffered to nurture the world, establishing the Seven Virtues and regulating laws and statutes, yet still they could not prevail. Thus they exiled the Four Fiends, and this extended to the Three Kings. The world was seized with terror; the Ru and Mohists arose together, mutually suspicious and deceitful. Virtue diverged, and authenticity scattered; wisdom flowed away, and the people were exhausted. Thus the sages and worthies concealed themselves to preserve their lives, while those in power were beset by peril and could not be saved.

The severity of laws and decrees stems from the agitation of the heart. That punishments and executions now race through the streets and alleys—is this not the consequence of the lofty discourses of the gentry? What began as the benefits of sagely wisdom and benevolence ended as the harms of *hengyang* and *jie*. Thus the worthy in office daily refine their laws, while the benighted in power daily multiply their decrees. Whether governance grows refined or coarse depends on the people alone.

Even rulers without the Way borrow the laws and statutes of sages and worthies to carry out their tyranny—are not Zeng and Shi the *haoshi* arrows that herald Jie and Zhì?

Fuzhai observes: This passage, when read alongside *Mencius*’s "entering and exiting without fixed times, their whereabouts unknown," is especially profound.

To be pressed downward is to be in a time of frustration, when the heart inclines toward the lowly; to gain power is to be ever advancing without cease. The more the heart strives upward, the more both high and low become prisons and executions, self-entangling and self-tormenting.

The unyielding may be softened by gentle restraint—Xiang Yu weeping over Lady Yu is such a case. To pare away sharp edges, to carve and polish, to grind and refine: the young who gain power lose their sharpness, and with further worldly experience, all is worn smooth.

Scorching fire and congealed ice—this describes how joy, anger, sorrow, and fear shift in an instant, the heart’s movements as swift as if traversing the four seas. Profound stillness is likened to immobility; the moment a thought arises, it is as if suspended from the heavens. *Fen* is the same as *fen*; *fenjiao* describes a state of haughty defiance. *Xi* means to restrain. This passage vividly depicts the human heart in a most extraordinary way.

"Thighs without flesh" means the spleen and flesh do not grow. "Shins without hair" means the feet are worn from toil. *Jin* means to stiffen the blood and qi, as if to say, "to bind internally with benevolence, righteousness, and laws." Despite such toil and suffering, the world remains ungovernable—hence the punishments of exile. Yao’s perfect governance could not avoid punishing the Four Fiends—how much less so in the ages after the Three Dynasties?

Jie and Zhòu, though exalted as Sons of Heaven, descended to the conduct of the lowliest; Zeng and Shi, though commoners, were admired for their reputations. The Ru and Mohists arose, mutually suspicious and derisive, and the true nature of life and destiny was utterly ruined.

Inner punishments lead to outer punishments: mutual suspicion and deceit brought utter chaos, while *shusi* and *hengyang* became the outer punishments. When outer constraints are applied, inner punishments follow; when inner punishments arise, outer punishments are enacted. Thus the Ru and Mohists emerged, the world fell into chaos, and executions stretched as far as the eye could see. *Shu* means to sever; *lu* means to disgrace.

The people’s demands were exhausted—there was nothing with which to answer them. Unable to prevail over the world, rulers resorted to punishments. Thus the worthy withdrew into reclusion while the sovereign toiled alone; the condemned multiplied, yet the Ru and Mohists still vaunted their lofty principles, strutting among the throng of convicts with their disjointed postures—how profoundly shameless! *Hengyang* were the stocks; *jiexi* were the central crossbars wedged tight. *Zuishi* were the whistling arrows of today. Only when the world was disordered did the name of “order” arise; only when the people’s hearts were corrupt did the pretext of “correcting” them emerge. The establishment of governing techniques began with the lawmaking rulers of the Middle Antiquity and decayed at the hands of later ministers who slavishly followed their traces. As the *Classic* says, does the nature of a tree inherently desire compass and square, hook and line? Cui Qu failed to understand that the human heart is originally endowed with perfect goodness and instead sought to govern the world’s hearts into goodness. The Old Master would have been ashamed to instruct him beyond “Simply do not disturb it—this is enough!” Why contrive to make it good? The corruption of today’s hearts lies in their fondness for suppressing the lowly and exalting the high, leading to contention, imprisonment, and slaughter. They do not know that yielding softness is the way of firm strength, and so they blunt their edges, carve their substance, delight and anger strike from without, ice and fire assail within—how much of that single spark of harmonious qi remains unscorched? Moreover, when a thought first arises, it is as if ten thousand rivers and a thousand mountains lie between, so vast is the gulf between stillness and the heavens—this is what is meant by “fuming arrogance that cannot be restrained.”

In high antiquity, nonaction prevailed: ruler and people each found their place, dwelling in primal chaos yet attaining tranquil vastness. When the Yellow Emperor began to govern, he first used the Seven Standards to constrain the human heart; by the time of Yao and Shun, governance was fully established, and the constraints grew ever deeper. The deeper the constraints, the more forcefully they were violated, so that the punishment of the Four Fiends became unavoidable, startling the world. Thus harm and grace arose in mutual succession—this is the inevitable consequence of such principles. Above, there were differing modes of governance; below, differing virtues. The nature of life and destiny became scattered beyond recovery, and the people’s demands were exhausted, with nothing left to offer. Then the disasters of saws, mallets, and chisels arose, and the world fell into chaos beyond remedy. The worthy concealed themselves to avoid calamity; rulers of ten thousand chariots trembled in anxious survival. The executed lay heaped upon the roads, and the failure of punishments to strike their mark was plain to see! Yet those who governed now rolled up their sleeves among the fetters and shackles, claiming they were equal to the burdens of turmoil and skilled in ordering chaos. They never realized that the cause of disorder was their own doing—no different from placing someone in drowning peril and then hitching up one’s robes to rescue them, believing this to be kindness. Not only does the other suffer distress, but the rescuer is also wearied and exhausted! From this we know that what the world calls sagacity, wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness are nearly always the stocks and crossbars of punishment; that Zeng, Shi, Yang, and Mo were not necessarily less than Jie and Zhòu’s instruments of harm.

The *Dao De Jing* says: “I practice nonaction, and the people transform themselves; I am without desire, and the people return to simplicity.” Is this not the governance of non-governance?

When the Yellow Emperor ascended the throne, he ruled as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, and his commands reached throughout the world. Hearing that Master Guangcheng dwelt atop Mount Kongtong, he went to see him and said: “I have heard that you have attained the perfection of the supreme Dao. I venture to ask: what is the essence of the supreme Dao? I wish to gather the essence of heaven and earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people; I also wish to regulate yin and yang to ensure the growth of all living things. How should this be done?”

Master Guangcheng replied: “What you wish to inquire about is the substance of things; what you wish to regulate is the dregs of things. Ever since you began to govern the world, clouds do not wait to gather before it rains, and plants do not wait to yellow before they fall. The light of the sun and moon grows ever more dim. With your heart so full of flattery and scheming, how can you speak of the supreme Dao?”

The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white cogon grass, and dwelled in seclusion for three months before returning to seek him again. Master Guangcheng lay with his head to the south, facing outward. The Yellow Emperor approached from downwind, crawling on his knees, bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and asked: “I have heard that you have attained the perfection of the supreme Dao. I venture to ask: how should one cultivate the body to attain longevity?”

Master Guangcheng rose abruptly and said: “Excellent question! Come, I will tell you of the supreme Dao. The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; its utmost limit is dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness, and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary your body, do not scatter your essence, and you may attain long life. Let your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, your heart know nothing—then your spirit will guard your body, and your body will attain long life. Guard your inner self, restrain your outer self, and excessive knowledge will lead to ruin. I have guided you to the great brightness above, to the source of utmost yang; I have led you into the gate of profound obscurity, to the source of utmost yin. Heaven and earth have their offices, yin and yang have their storehouses. Guard your body carefully, and things will flourish of themselves. I preserve the One and dwell in harmony, and so I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined.”

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and said: “Master Guangcheng is what we call Heaven!”

Master Guangcheng said: “Come, I will tell you more. Those things are inexhaustible, yet people all take them to be finite; those things are unfathomable, yet people all take them to be limited. One who attains my Dao may become a sovereign above or a king below; one who loses my Dao may see light above but become dust below. Now all the myriad beings are born from the earth and return to the earth. Therefore I will leave you and enter the gate of the inexhaustible, roam the wilds of the boundless. I will share the light of the sun and moon and be constant with heaven and earth. Let what is near to me be bright; let what is distant be dim. Let others all perish—I alone will endure!”

Guo’s commentary: “To ask about the essence of the supreme Dao—this is indeed a substantive inquiry.”

To impose governance upon what should be left to itself is to bring ruin. If all people cultivate themselves without meddling in the world, the world will be well-ordered. The profound and obscure, the dim and silent—all are utterly without form. What Laozi and Zhuangzi repeatedly call "nothingness" makes clear that the generator of beings is no-thing, yet beings arise of themselves.

To forget seeing yet see of itself, to forget hearing yet hear of itself, to let things move as they will—thus one remains serene and does not perish prematurely. Guard within to preserve one’s true nature; close without to maintain one’s proper place. To presume knowledge of the boundless is to court defeat.

To fathom the source of yin and yang is to recognize that there are offices and repositories, yet one should simply let them be. To follow the utmost of one’s nature and destiny, to reach the ultimate of long life—only then, without dying young, can one extend to others. Beings are inexhaustible, yet people take them to be finite, seeing only one side.

The titles of sovereign and king rise and fall with the times; those who grasp the Dao of adaptability respond to the inexhaustible as one. Losing the inexhaustible Dao, one clings to a single partial view, unable to harmonize above and below, thus inclining and declining with shifting intent. Earth is without mind; born from the mindless, one should return to guard the mindless and proceed alone.

Entering the inexhaustible, roaming the boundless—thus one moves with transformation. Sharing the light of the sun and moon, constant with heaven and earth—all is left to itself. The coming and going of things are unperceived, so life and death are as one, and nowhere is there not preservation.

Lu’s commentary: “Above Kongtong, where there is no-thing yet great passage prevails.” The Dao is the uncarved simplicity of the nameless, hence called "substance." Yin and yang are the dispersal of the Dao, hence called "ruin." Clouds and mists do not wait to gather before spreading into desolation—this is not assisting their natural course but rather harming it.

Secluding oneself for three months, reaching the utmost in purity, following the wind to advance, tracing the root to seek it—only the Dao enables one to govern the self and endure. This is indeed to inquire into its essence. The profound and obscure are without form, beyond words and beyond thought, yet there is what is called "essence"—to speak of it is not to reach its ultimate. Only in utter dimness and silence does one attain the Dao’s utmost.

This speaks of the Dao’s body: without seeing, without hearing, one may enter the Dao and attain long life. Embracing the spirit in stillness, the form does not strive for correctness yet becomes correct of itself. Serene and pure, it cannot be disturbed or muddied; the form is not wearied yet preserved, the essence is not agitated yet restored—only then can one attain long life.

The spirit is formless yet clings to things; if it does not cling to things but returns to the unseen and unknowing, how can one guard the form? Guard within to block its openings; close without to shut its gates—this is the way to nurture and preserve the spirit. The opposite leads to excessive knowledge and ruin.

Those who do not know the Dao are confined by yin and yang and never reach their source. Without seeing, without hearing, without knowing, one enters the realm of great clarity, passes through the gate of the profound and obscure. Attaining and exhausting this, one knows that heaven and earth have their offices, and their governance lies herein; yin and yang have their repositories, and their storage lies herein. Guard your body carefully—things will naturally flourish, so why seek externally?

The Yellow Emperor further explained that what was earlier called "no seeing, no hearing" pertains to the body of the Dao. As for its function, no seeing is how one sees of itself, no hearing is how one hears of itself, no knowing is how one knows of itself. The Dao as a thing is inexhaustible and unfathomable, yet it ultimately resides in nothingness. Seeing, hearing, knowing—these take the inexhaustible as finite, the unfathomable as limited.

Those who attain the Dao become sovereigns or kings, for their spirit and clarity give rise to royal authority. Those who lose the Dao see light yet become dust, for their form does not transcend the space between illumination and earthly covering. The hundred beings are born from earth and return to earth by their form alone. Thus I will leave you, enter the inexhaustible, and roam the boundless—those who take this as an end or limit do not truly know me!

Sharing the light of the sun and moon, their brightness does not cease; constant with heaven and earth, their duration is without end. When I am near, one does not perceive it as near; when I am distant, one does not perceive it as distant. All people perish while I alone endure—seeking within myself, I know not what thing enables me to reach this. Of the myriad beings, humans are the most spiritually endowed. How rare it is for creation to produce one, and how rare among humans are those whose intelligence and insight can attain this—yet if they do not diligently pursue it, then those who treasure compassion will surely repeat these words again and again.

You Du’s commentary: The Yellow Emperor, having ruled for many years, regulated the cycles of yin and yang to govern the world—hence his progress. Guangcheng did not govern the world—hence his Dao. The Yellow Emperor sought to master heaven and earth and govern yin and yang—this is the work of one who embodies the utmost destiny and spirit. Yin and yang refer to qi; heaven and earth refer to form. Qi is refined while form is coarse; the refined is the essence of spirit, while yin and yang are the dispersal of the Dao.

What can be questioned and answered easily scatters into heaven and earth; what can be governed and entrusted scatters spirit into yin and yang. Clouds and mists do not gather before rain, yet yin and yang lose their principle; plants and trees do not yellow before falling, yet the myriad beings lose their Dao. Even the dimming of the sun and moon—none of this is the governance of the spiritually perfected.

Seclusion without being burdened by things; three months, the minor completion of a cycle. The essence of the supreme Dao is the Great Simplicity; the ultimate of the supreme Dao is the Great Ultimate. Yin and yang arise from the Great Simplicity; heaven and earth arise from the Great Ultimate. The profound and obscure, the dim and silent—without image or number—are thus called "essence" and "ultimate." The eye is not disordered by colors, the ear is not disordered by sounds—thus the spirit remains whole and undisturbed by the deviant.

Qi does not interfere, and form settles into oneness. Do not labor your form—*Laozi* says: "Bear the soul and spirit," this is it. Do not agitate your essence—*Laozi* says: "Embrace the One," this is it. The *po* governs form; the One is the number of essence. Those who study the Dao should expand their aspiration without being burdened by form, so that spirit constantly bears the *po* yet is not borne by the *po*—thus may one embrace the One and embody the spirit!

Now, when people die and differ in ascent or descent, it is because they extinguish spirit to follow form, letting spirit submit to the *po*, and so sink into dark yin, transforming into other beings. But those whose spirit is whole—though the *po*’s yin stagnates—will unite with spirit and go anywhere without hindrance.

When the eye sees nothing, it turns inward; when the ear hears nothing, it reverses its hearing; when the heart knows nothing, it thinks nothing. Thus, dust is barred from without, roots are secured within, and form may attain long life. Guard within, and the true does not scatter; close without, and dust does not enter—this is the meaning of "daily diminishing" in the Dao. To know much is to daily increase one’s affairs, and so invite ruin.

Above the great brightness, the Dao is manifest; at the gate of the profound and obscure, mysterious virtue resides. Supreme yang has no yin; supreme yin has no yang. The *yuan* is the root of yin and yang, the source from which the myriad things emerge. That things are boundless and unfathomable yet deemed finite is merely human speech. The *huang* is that from which kings arise—this is the Way of Heaven; kings emerge from the *huang*—this is the Way of Man. Light speaks of heaven, earth speaks of soil. Those who attain the Dao emerge as kings, withdraw as *huang*, and are bound by nothing; those who lose the Dao are partial—above, they appear as light; below, as mere soil.

Now, the hundred flourishing things of the world begin in soil and end in soil—does soil have intent toward them? Humans are born from the formless and die into the formless—how can they remain bound to the human realm? I shall depart from you: though the body dwells among men, the heart has already left to wander with the Creator!

The boundless has no visible beginning; the infinite has no visible end. The gate is that through which entry and exit occur; the wild is vast and without destination. Aligning with the sun and moon in brightness, uniting with heaven and earth in virtue—thus the mind of the perfected is like a mirror: things come, and it responds; things go, and it forgets. When things come to me, I am luminous, as if bound to them; when things depart, I am dim, as if forgetting them. The coming and going of things are all unperceived.

"All men may die, yet I alone endure"—this means the spirit-person unites with creation, and life and death cannot alter them.

*Detailed Commentary on the Dao*:
Heaven and earth have their offices—one may serve them but not defy them; yin and yang have their storehouses—one may entrust them but not abandon them. To govern yin and yang to prolong life is to steer heaven with human will, opposing nature—how many things would not be harmed?

*Laozi* says: "The Dao is level, yet people prefer shortcuts," and also: "To augment life is called ill-omened." If one seeks speed and forces growth, a child may be born before its time and perish. Clouds and mists not gathering before rain—how is this different from one who pulls up seedlings to hasten their growth? This is why those who defy the sun and moon only hasten their ruin!

The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquishing the world—he could transcend things but not yet transcend life, so he asked about the Dao of cultivating the body. Guangchengzi taught him to be utterly still and utterly pure, and thus he attained transcendence of life. He further taught that things are without limit—when dim and silent, seeing and hearing perceive nothing; when profound and obscure, even grasping finds nothing.

The ears and eyes are bandits of the heart—thus one must utterly refrain from seeing and hearing, then embrace spirit in stillness. Movement and turbidity are pests to form and essence—thus one must be secretly still to avoid laboring form, secretly pure to avoid laboring essence. This is why closing and guarding are prized, not the accumulation of knowledge.

Yang is manifest, so it abides above the great brightness; yin is hidden, so it enters the realm of the profound and obscure. Guarding the One is the perfection of essence; dwelling in harmony is the perfection of harmony. To contain virtue deeply is to be like an infant—this is the perfection of essence and harmony. Thus, one may live twelve hundred years without the body ever declining!

The Dao has no beginning before and no end after—it differs from that which has number; it is neither entangled above nor dim below—it differs from that which has form. Light is the essence of yang; soil is the substance of yin. Losing the Dao, one is enslaved above by yang and so appears as light; controlled below by yin, one becomes mere soil.

All things are born from soil and return to soil—I shall depart from it. Aligning with the sun and moon in radiance unites their brightness; abiding with heaven and earth as constant unites their virtue. When I am luminous, what unites with me becomes luminous as Dao; when I am dim, what distances itself from me becomes dim as things.

"All men may die, yet I alone endure"—this means they flourish their branches and leaves to harm the root, while I deepen the root and secure the stem to preserve the branches and leaves.

*Blue Void Commentary*:
To have desires, to take—this is not essence and subtlety, but coarse substance. To have methods, to govern—this is not wholeness of the true, but certain injury. To rule the world oneself brings yang disasters and yin calamities, and the two luminaries lose their brightness—how can one speak of the supreme Dao?

The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquishing the world, crawling on his knees to ask about cultivating the body. Guangchengzi first taught him of the profound and obscure, forcibly naming the essence of the Dao; of the dim and silent, forcibly naming the ultimate of the Dao. Not taking colors as colors, not taking sounds as sounds—thus spirit is still and form is upright. Stillness means spirit is not labored; purity means essence is not agitated. Not seeing recklessly, thus no sight; not hearing recklessly, thus no hearing; not thinking recklessly, thus no thought.

The three are all true, thus spirit abides and form endures. Guarding within empties the heart; closing without seals the apertures. Ever wary of how excessive knowledge brings ruin, one thus transcends yin and yang, meeting the realm of the Dao.

The three luminaries shine brightly, the five peaks stand firm—heaven and earth have their offices. The four seasons nurture life, the myriad things take form—yin and yang have their treasuries. Governing oneself, things transform and daily grow stronger; in purity and oneness, the harmonious and subtle gather, thus cultivating the body for one thousand two hundred years without the form ever decaying.

Li Chunfeng’s *Tian Yuan Zhu Wu Bo* states: "One thousand two hundred is called the great cycle, also known as the lesser reckoning of yin and yang." The Dao has no beginning, how could it have an end? Not knowing whose child it is, how could it have a limit? Above it is sovereign, below it is king—greatest within the realm. Above it is light, below it is earth—yet it is one thing.

The myriad things arise and perish of themselves; I too am but cultivation’s coming and going. The gate of the great void is boundless; the wilds of creation are infinite. Matching the sun and moon in radiance yet not displaying oneself, aligning with heaven and earth as constant yet not differing from them.

Things near me are like threads—subtle yet unperceived; things far from me are like darkness—obscure and unknown. When all others meet their destined end, I alone endure, for I possess that which does not perish.

Yongzhai states: "To govern yin and yang is to ensure each fulfills its office." The inherent nature of things is called *zhi*—this is the supreme Dao of earlier speech. "Things’ ruin" refers to harm done to them. Heaven and earth, yin and yang—all follow natural principle. The five grains grow of themselves, each unfolding as it must. To impose intention upon them is to harm them instead.

Clouds gather not yet rain falls—here it is, there it is not. Leaves fall without awaiting yellow—timing is lost. Profound and obscure, dim and silent, so subtle as to be invisible. Without sight, without hearing, ears and eyes both forgotten. Still and non-active, the form corrects itself; spirit remains pure and tranquil, the form unlabored. Qi unagitated, one may attain longevity—this is the origin of present cultivation arts.

No labor, no agitation—*wu* here shares the sense of *wu* ("do not"), conveying prohibition. No seeing, no hearing, no knowing—this further explains the lines "without reckless sight" and "embracing spirit." Guarding within stills the heart; closing without prevents things from stirring the five senses. Only in unknowing does virtue remain whole; excessive knowledge ruins affairs.

The great brightness is the great void; the profound and obscure is the infinite. The human body itself contains heaven and earth, yin and yang. When my heaven and earth each fulfill their offices, my yin and yang each rest in their places, then this body may be guarded with care, and all things within it grow firm. "Things" here refer to all within this body. What is guarded is singular and unadulterated; where it dwells, all is harmonious and compliant—thus one thousand two hundred years pass without the form decaying.

Guangchengzi speaks of heaven—of merging with it as one. How can things have limits when humans seek their ends? How can things be fathomed when humans demand their bounds? To pursue the boundless with the bounded is folly. The *Book of Changes* does not conclude with *Completion* but with *Incompletion*—thus we know things are endless and unfathomable. The Master by the river said: "Passing away like this!"—also pointing to the endless and unfathomable.

Above as sovereign, below as king—like the "inner sage, outer king" of the *Under Heaven* chapter. The sovereign acts not; the king acts—this is not the kings of the Three Sovereigns or Three Dynasties. "Above it is light" refers to the sun and moon; "below it is earth" refers to the ground. Dwelling between heaven and earth, utterly unknowing, one looks up to see only sun and moon, looks down to see only earth.

The hundred things arise from earth and return to earth—wondrous and foul, putrid and fragrant, all transform in turn. "Depart from you" means leaving the human world. The boundless gate, the infinite wilds—speaking of what lies beyond heaven and earth. Thus one may share the same longevity as heaven and earth, sun and moon.

*Jin* is the same as *ming* ("dark"). *Hun* means obscurity. Things that approach me come; those that recede go—whether things come or go, I remain oblivious. Kongtong is also written as Kongdong. Sima’s old commentary states:

When the Northern Dipper descends below the mountain.
The *Erya* states: "Northward, bearing the Dipper’s pole, is Kongtong Mountain." Though such a mountain has existed since antiquity, it also seems to carry symbolic meaning. The Dipper resides at heaven’s center, governing all transformations; the mountain, bearing the Dipper’s pole, stands at earth’s center. Kongtong, positioned at the center of heaven and earth, serves as a metaphor for the human heart abiding in the center to govern externals—those who dwell in it well command all things.

Guangchengzi may refer to Laozi, though we need not fixate on this; he is simply an ancient sage. The Yellow Emperor went to inquire about the supreme Dao and was told: "The essence of heaven and earth is a primordial, undifferentiated substance; the qi of yin and yang, once divided, is but a remnant. What you seek to ask still approaches the Dao; what you seek to govern is but a residue. Far removed from the Dao, how can it be worth discussing?"

The Yellow Emperor withdrew and lived in seclusion, then returned to ask about the Dao of cultivating the body. Only then was he instructed: "See nothing, hear nothing; embrace the spirit and rectify the form. Be still, be pure; exert no labor, stir no disturbance. Reach the origin of yin and yang—there lies the ultimate Dao of self-cultivation! Heaven and earth have their offices, yin and yang their storehouses." This refers to the inner workings of the body, guiding one to seek within. A lifespan of twelve hundred years merely reflects the brief span of human inquiry compared to a single cosmic cycle. If one seeks its division—the source of spirit’s descent and qi’s generation—it spans from ancient times to the present without end.

Since the existence of heaven and earth, yin and yang, there have been humans and all things. Those who come after my body are beyond calculation—this is the boundless and unfathomable. Yet people regard it as finite because they observe only the transformations of form and fail to perceive what does not change. "Above as sovereign, below as king"—this speaks of attaining the Dao, not of holding rank and title. Thus, though times may differ, the transformation of all things remains the same.

"Above it is light; below it is earth"—this describes those who lose the Dao: their essence and spirit become will-o’-the-wisps, their bones and flesh return to dust. Such are the vainly born and recklessly dead, mere playthings of creation’s forging. The myriad beings arise from earth and return to earth—this too hinges on whether one attains or loses the Dao. The Dao has no gain or loss; things have their departures and arrivals, emerging from and entering into mechanism—such is transformation.

"I shall depart from you"—this means I will not return to earth but ascend to the Great Void, thereby sharing the same longevity as the Two Modes and the Two Luminaries. Those who approach me are in harmony with the Dao, obscure and dark; those who recede from me are benighted and unknowing.

"All men shall perish"—this means the multitudes end in transformation, while I alone endure. This "I" is not the "I" of the nine orifices and hundred bones, but the original "I" of clarity, tranquility, subtlety, and emptiness—unseen by form, unsought by sound. Thus, it existed before heaven and earth, standing alone and unchanging.

I privately reflect that the two sages personally transmitted the essentials of the Dao in this chapter, which contains no lofty or difficult practices—only simplicity and clarity. Yet later generations, shallow and fond of the strange, contrived theories of visualization, extraction, and union, exhausting spirit and body in pursuit of tranquility. Some even blindly lead the blind, driving ice-carts upon volcanoes without awakening—how many fail to preserve their very source of life?

The world has long lacked true discernment. Upon reverently reading the teachings of Guangcheng, I have ventured these reckless words, which may yet find those who, though reckless, will grasp them.

**Chapter "In Indulgence" the Third**

Cloud General was roaming eastward when he passed the branches of the Whirlwind Tree and chanced upon Vast Vagueness. Vast Vagueness was just then patting his chest and leaping about in play. Cloud General, seeing this, halted in astonishment and stood transfixed, asking: "Old sir, who are you? What are you doing here?"

Vast Vagueness, still patting his chest and leaping without pause, replied to Cloud General: "Roaming!"

Cloud General said: "I wish to ask you something."

Vast Vagueness looked up at Cloud General and sighed: "Ah!"

Cloud General said: "The qi of Heaven is disharmonious, the qi of Earth is pent-up; the Six Qi are unbalanced, the Four Seasons disordered. Now I wish to harmonize the nature of the Six Qi to nurture all living things—what should I do?"

Vast Vagueness, still patting his chest and leaping, shook his head and said: "I know not! I know not!"

Cloud General could get no answer. Three years later, he roamed eastward again, passing through the wilds of Song, where he once more chanced upon Vast Vagueness. Cloud General rejoiced greatly, hastening forward to meet him, saying: "Has Heaven forgotten me? Has Heaven forgotten me?" He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and begged to hear from Vast Vagueness.

Vast Vagueness said: "Drifting, I know not what I seek; reckless, I know not where I go. Roaming carefree, I observe the uncontrived. What do I know?"

Cloud General said: "I too thought myself reckless, yet the people follow wherever I go. I cannot be free of the people, and now they imitate me—pray, grant me a word of instruction."

Vast Vagueness said: "To disorder the warp of Heaven, to contravene the nature of things—even the Dark Heaven cannot bring this to fruition. Loose the grasses that bind the beasts, and the birds will all cry at night; calamity will reach the plants and trees, disaster the insects and worms. Alas! This is the fault of those who govern men!"

Cloud General said: "Then what am I to do?"

Vast Vagueness said: "Alas, how poisonous! Go back, go back, you immortal!"

Cloud General said: "I have met with Heaven’s difficulty—pray, grant me a word of instruction."

Vast Vagueness said: "Ah! Cultivate the heart. Abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. Cast off your form, expel your cleverness, forget both self and things. Merge with the great confluence, untie the heart, release the spirit, and be utterly without soul. The ten thousand things, drifting like clouds, each return to their root, each return to their root yet know it not. Vague and undifferentiated, they never depart from it all their lives. If they were to know it, they would depart from it. Ask not their names, pry not into their natures—things will thus live of themselves."

Cloud General said: "Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me, shown me silence. Seeking it in myself, I have now attained it." He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, then rose and took his leave.

Guo's Commentary:
To seek without knowing what one seeks yet attain what one seeks, to go without knowing where one goes yet reach where one goes—thus the inwardly sufficient find all things self-correcting when they lift their gaze. Riding things is not for the sake of pathways, yet pathways manifest of themselves; wild abandon is not to summon the people, yet the people come of themselves—thus one is imitated by the people and cannot but comply. If one follows the nature of things without governing them, then feelings do not rebel and constants do not disorder, and the profound silence achieves what is naturally attained.

When beasts are scattered and crows cry at night, they depart from their source of stillness, and grasses, trees, and insects suffer harm while sitting idle. For where there are traces of governance, there disorder arises. Alas! How poisonous—this sigh over the excesses of those who govern.

*Fufu* describes the posture of sitting and rising, lamenting that one cannot be utterly unrestrained and far-reaching, hence dispatching the envoy to return. When the heart is harmed by use, then to nurture the heart—is it not precisely by not using the heart? When principle and things are not held in mind but entrusted to nature, then non-action transforms of itself. Merging with the confluence, one becomes boundless with things, utterly without soul, sitting in forgetfulness and entrusting oneself to solitude. Vague and undifferentiated, one knows nothing yet lets things return of themselves—only thus can one never depart from the root all one’s life. To know and then return is to depart from returning.

To inquire and to pry is to lose their self-arising; to be silent and know it is to always attain of itself.

Lü's Commentary:
Cloud General is one who takes nourishing the world as his own duty. The branches of the whirlwind are the extremities of movement. *Hong* (vast) and *meng* (obscure) in his name reveal his nature. If one wishes to harmonize the six qi to nurture all life, then one has the intention to nourish the world—yet I say this is not true knowing. All people have what they seek and where they go; I alone know neither what I seek nor where I go, attaining it only through unknowing.

*Yangzhang* describes constraint, as if even the wanderer were bound, yet I see that the truth of the world is nothing more than this. When the ten thousand things arise together, I observe their return. In returning, there is no delusion—what then do I know? To consider oneself wild and unrestrained is to be without self-interest. The people’s dissipation is not yet non-action. Heaven is non-action; things are without knowledge. To have knowledge and to act is to disorder the heavenly constants, rebel against the nature of things, and fail to achieve the profound Heaven.

The year has its profound Heaven—this is the winter solstice. The month has its profound Heaven—this is the last day. The day has its profound Heaven—this is midnight. And man too has his profound Heaven. Those of old who sought the abode of the upright qi to preserve their spirit and beautify their root did not fail to know this—yet this is not what the officials make manifest.

That the profound Heaven fails to be achieved and calamity befalls birds, beasts, and insects is nearly due to the error of not knowing non-action yet governing them. Medicine is used to cure illness; to govern with non-action is like administering poison where there is no illness. The envoy was sent back, desiring him to return to the root and seek it.

All people have a formed heart; it lies in self-nurturance alone. In self-nurturance, there is nothing to be done, and things transform of themselves. Encompassing the form, one forgets the six limbs; expelling cleverness, one forgets ears and eyes. Principle lies within me; things lie outside. The confluence is the emptiness of qi awaiting things. When I forget things and merge with the confluence, the heart is untied, the spirit released, and one is utterly without soul—this is how one abides in the Way of non-action.

When things are just arising, I do not know it; when I cause things to return to their root, I do not know it either. Thus vague and undifferentiated, they become one, never departing from it all their lives. Without inquiry and without prying, things arise of themselves. When one is without knowledge, one does not know one is without knowledge. To say, "Is this called unknowing?" is to inquire into its name. To ask, "Is this truly unknowing?" is to pry into its nature. It is like a thing just arising—if one uproots it to examine it, it cannot live. Heaven’s way of creating things is like this.

Du’s Commentary:
Cloud General is the commander of clouds. *Hongmeng* is the qi before the division of yin and yang. *Fuyao* refers to wind, signifying its formlessness. *Wandering* means following one’s natural inclinations—what *Liezi* calls "ultimate wandering." Cloud General had not seen the essence of the Dao, so he pointed to current affairs and asked about harmonizing the six qi to nurture all life.

Hongmeng said: "Wander!" He could not yet be without opposition. Next, he looked up and said: "Hmm! Now there is no opposition," yet he could not be without demonstration. Finally, he said: "I do not know, I do not know!" Then there was no demonstration—this is the ultimate attainment of the Dao.

*Yangzhang* means constraint; though one is bound at first, one ultimately attains of oneself, and all one sees is correct without delusion. Observing thus, what do I know? To take unknowing as knowing is true knowing.

Heaven has its constancy, and all things have their nature. To disrupt and oppose them is why the mysterious Heaven does not attain completion. The mysterious is the essence of the wondrous; the celestial offices are natural. Birds, beasts, insects—all possess the principle of life and destiny. Following this principle brings peace; opposing it brings chaos. Now, to forcibly govern them is to untie their bonds and make them cry out in the night.

The cultivation of the heart-mind: all dharmas arise from the heart-mind. Nurture it with principle, stabilize it with stillness. When things come, respond; when they depart, forget. Only then can one achieve non-action yet leave nothing undone, transcend form and abandon knowledge to merge with the great thoroughfare, where human relations and the principles of things blend into one. Thus, to release the heart-mind and liberate the spirit, to be vacant and without soul—this is the ultimate of the human Dao, by which one harmonizes with Heaven.

As for the myriad things—each illusory transformation returns to its root. This speaks of the impermanence of illusory forms in conditioned existence, while the empty nature is indestructible, thus reaching the destiny of life. Vast and undifferentiated, one remains thus all one’s life. If one claims to know it, the Dao departs.

At first, there was constraint, and thus names arose. Where life and destiny reside, there emotions arise. Names and emotions are not the concern of the spirit-person returning to destiny. Without inquiring into names, names do not harm reality. Without scrutinizing emotions, emotions do not overcome nature. Things then arise of themselves—this is the attainment of the principle of the myriad things.

Cloud General heard these words and awakened: Heaven referred to Hongmeng, who descended virtue and demonstrated silence. All speak of the spirit-person’s way of engaging with things—attaining that which is without attainment, thus rising in speech and departing.

*Bixu’s Commentary*: Cloud General is the marshal of rain and moisture; *Shuyou* is the practice of benevolence and kindness. The branches of the whirlwind are where the wind first passes. Hongmeng is primordial qi. *Wandering* refers to the movement of primordial qi. If the upper does not branch, the lower does not ascend; if the five movements are disordered, the six qi rebel—this is the wilds of Song, where moisture and nourishment abound.

Without knowing what one seeks, one is unattached to things. Without knowing where one goes, one wanders freely without intent. Though things are numerous, their divisions naturally align—what do I know? Clouds are originally without mind, yet the people follow and thus gain a mind. The general acts out of necessity, yet the people imitate and thus create boundaries. Intentional change disrupts constancy; self-will enslaves emotion. Disrupted and opposed, the principle of Heaven is difficult to complete. Thus, mountain forests lack tranquil scenes, and marshes lack harmonious qi—all due to laws being too explicit and regulations too severe!

*Heart-mind cultivation* means nurturing with the heart-mind. Non-action nurtures the heart-mind; action is nurtured by the heart-mind. The heart-mind is not mine to possess; nature is originally empty. Unaware of movement or stillness, one merges with the vast darkness. Light and shadow both vanish, returning to profound obscurity. Undifferentiated, one remains thus—knowledge causes separation!

Without name, without emotion—what is there to inquire or scrutinize? In silence, what is there to seek? Cloud’s virtue could not but rise in speech and depart—this is wondrous function.

Fu Zhai states: The branches of the whirling winds are the very land where the Fusang sun rises. The inquiry of Yusheng is identical to the Yellow Emperor’s question in the previous chapter. "Burdened governance" describes a state of chaos and turmoil. "Without delusion" is authenticity. Amidst chaos and turmoil, one observes one’s own authenticity. "Unable to abandon the people" means desiring to withdraw yet being unable. The people’s excesses take me as their model. The celestial principles and the nature of things are both spontaneous. To act with intention is to cause disorder. Opposing spontaneity, the mysterious Heaven cannot be completed. "Mysterious" means emptiness, akin to "prior to Heaven." Failing to assist things in their natural course, causing them to lose their nature, brings calamity even to grasses, trees, and insects. This is the fault of governing people with intention—how poisonous it is! "Transmit, transmit!" urges a hasty return.

"Heart-mind cultivation" means: cease your efforts, and this heart-mind will nurture itself. It is not called "nurturing the heart-mind" but "the heart-mind’s nurturing"—ponder this carefully. Simply abide in non-action, and things will spontaneously arise and transform. Expel all former cleverness, let distinctions and judgments dissolve, and forget all things—then you will merge with the vast primordial depths. The "vast depths" are the origin of formlessness and qi-lessness. Dissolve the heart-mind of intention, release the spirit of knowing. "Without soul" means without knowledge. Each returns to its root; what is born must perish. Though perishing, it does not perish—what perishes is reborn. Thus, it is said: each returns to its root yet remains unaware. In utter chaos, without knowledge or awareness, one never departs from the Dao throughout life. The moment knowledge and awareness arise, one strays from it.

The slightest discrimination is called "name"; likes and dislikes are called "emotion." Without inquiry, without scrutiny, there is no discrimination, no preference—this is non-action and spontaneity. Thus, all things fulfill their lives! Heaven bestows upon me the virtue of spontaneity, revealing to me the principle of wordless teaching. Turning inward to seek, I have already attained this Dao. Having obtained what is to be obtained, I bow in gratitude and depart.

Cloud General is one who dispenses rain and regulates yin and yang. Passing the branches of the whirling winds symbolizes entering the realm of activity, showing his desire to emerge and nourish all things. Hong Meng is primordial qi. "Leaping and roaming" describes movement in perfect ease. Primordial qi moves and rain is dispensed—this illustrates the transformative influence of a sagely ruler who leaves all things at peace. Cloud General wishes to harmonize the six qi to nurture all life, yet this inevitably involves intention, akin to the previous chapter’s notion of seizing Heaven and Earth and officiating yin and yang. Hong Meng responds with "knowing by not-knowing"—here the Dao is fully expressed. Cloud General, unable to comprehend, retreats, only to encounter Hong Meng again and pose further questions.

At first, Hong Meng tells him: seek not what you desire, nor where you are headed. Seek within yourself and you will be sufficient; there is no need to inquire of others afar. Roaming freely in the world, burdened yet self-content, one is thus able to perceive the true principle. Why then seek knowledge externally? These words clarify that despite instruction, Cloud General still fails to awaken. He then confesses his own recklessness and inability to abandon the people. Hong Meng admonishes his error, saying: You merely busy yourself with excessive words and deeds, disrupting the celestial constancy, opposing the principles of things, and corrupting the mysterious silence of Heaven. Thus, birds and beasts, grasses and trees, insects—all lose their proper place. This is the fault of governing people. "Poison" means to govern—how can one govern the world?

"Return and rest," he says, "ask no more." Yet Cloud General’s doubts remain unresolved, and he wishes to hear one final word. Hong Meng tells him: What you doubt is the heart-mind. Losing the nurturing of the heart-mind is to abandon the abode of spirit. Nurture it with non-action, and the spirit will be whole. With spirit whole, one is sufficient to transform all things. From "casting aside your form" to "silent and soulless"—this is the secret of heart-mind cultivation. At its utmost, even nurturing is forgotten. The myriad things drift like clouds, each returning to its root. Movement at its extreme inevitably stills—this is the principle of spontaneity. How can knowledge intervene? Simply abide in utter chaos, guard it and do not lose it. The moment knowledge sprouts, one strays from the Dao.

Inquiry into names and scrutiny of emotions belong to knowledge. If one can sever these, then all things will transform spontaneously—why strive to harmonize the six qi to nurture life? Cloud General then awakens: excessive words harm the Dao; silence is the virtue of descent. It lies in turning inward to seek within oneself. Thus, one who takes nourishing all things as their duty labors in vain, while one who entrusts the world to its own self-governance rests in effortless transformation. Nurturing the myriad things and harmonizing the world do not exceed the work of preserving spirit and nurturing the heart-mind. The spirit-like persons of antiquity, who ensured that creatures suffered no plagues and grains ripened in season, did so by this means.

The common people all delight in those who agree with them and despise those who differ. They desire agreement and reject difference because they harbor the ambition to stand out from the crowd. Yet how can one who harbors such ambition ever truly stand out? Relying on the crowd to secure what they have heard, they are no different from the masses in skill. Those who seek to govern others’ states grasp at the benefits of the Three Kings while blind to their perils—this is to gamble with others’ states. How often can one gamble and not lose the state? In preserving a state, success is less than one in ten thousand; in losing it, one failure brings ten thousand losses. How lamentable that those who possess lands do not understand!

Those who possess lands possess great things. Possessing great things, one must not be possessed by them. Being a thing yet not a thing, one can thus master all things. Understanding that the master of things is not a thing—how could this apply merely to governing the world and its people? Moving in and out of the six directions, roaming the nine provinces, coming and going alone—this is called "possessing alone." One who possesses alone is called most noble. The teaching of the great person is like the shadow following form, the echo responding to sound. When questioned, they respond, exhausting what is in their heart-mind, becoming the counterpart of Heaven and Earth.

Dwelling in noiselessness, moving without fixed direction. Leading you to the ceaseless flux of returning, roaming without bound; entering and exiting without side, sharing no beginning with the sun. Praising and discoursing on the form and body, merging with the Great Harmony—great harmony without self. Without self, how could one obtain what is called "having"? Those who weave the threads of having were the noble ones of old; those who perceive nothingness are friends of Heaven and Earth.

Guo’s Commentary: Those whose hearts desire to emerge from the crowd as mere stragglers all take standing out as their aim, which is why the multitude cannot surpass one another. When all take standing out as their aim, yet I alone go along without divergence, this is the greatest distinction from the crowd and becomes the master of the multitude. What I alone have heard is not as abundant as the many skills of the many. Thus, following the many brings tranquility; not following the many makes the thousands and ten thousands of the many all one’s adversaries. Those who wish to govern others’ lands do not follow the many in their self-governance but impose their own will—this is merely seeking the profit of the Three Kings in mastering things while failing to see the exhaustion of imposing one’s will. Did the Three Kings profit from such imposition? They simply followed the self-governance of all under Heaven! To monopolize all under Heaven with one’s own will—when all under Heaven is blocked, how can one’s self be open? Thus, one’s own person fails, and ten thousand losses follow. How lamentable that the lords who possess lands do not understand!

Those who possess great things cannot be used by things. To say one cannot employ things is to be a thing oneself, insufficient to possess great things. Those who employ things are not employed by things—this is not being a thing. Not being a thing, one can thus master all things under Heaven. Understanding that they act on their own without exhaustion. All people distinguish themselves, yet I alone wander in simplicity—this is called "going and coming alone," "possessing alone." Moreover, merging in profound unity with the many, not seeking recognition from the crowd, yet the crowd cannot but honor them—this is the highest nobility! If one clings to partial views, taking uniqueness as one’s aim, then even if aligned in one direction, one remains but a thing among the vulgar—no "possessor alone."

The hearts of the common people are form and sound; the teaching of the great person is shadow and echo. What heart does the great person hold toward all under Heaven? They allow each being to fully realize what is in their heart-mind. The questioner is the host; the responder is the counterpart. Dwelling in noiselessness, one awaits things in stillness; moving without fixed direction, one transforms with things. Lifting and guiding the ten thousand things, returning them to their self-moving nature—this is the perfection of non-action. Roaming without bound, one moves with transformation; entering and exiting without side, merging in profound unity without distinction, renewing with the sun. Thus, there is no beginning or end. Praising and discoursing on the great person’s form and bearing, they are no different from Heaven and Earth. With self, one cannot achieve Great Harmony. The difficulty of nothingness in all under Heaven lies in the self. Once the self is gone, what need is there to speak of having?

Those who perceive having were the noble ones of old, merely able to beautify their names. Those who perceive nothingness are friends of Heaven and Earth, allowing their solitary life to unfold. Lü’s Commentary: The non-action and spontaneity of the Dao is not only for the ruler to embody—those who assist the ruler with the Dao should also follow the many to attain tranquility, without meddling in governing others’ lands. What one person has heard is not as abundant as the many skills of the many. To insist on taking charge of others’ lands is to rely on luck to avoid loss. The rise of the Three Kings and the mutual support of ruler and minister were indeed based on this as profit, yet later ages often saw it as exhaustion. Those who wish to govern others’ lands grasp at its profit while failing to see its harm.

The Yellow Emperor’s question to Guangcheng and Yao’s meeting with the Four Masters all took mastery of great things as exhaustion, merely to clarify that those who master things are not things themselves. What I embody is the Dao; beyond the Dao, there is no thing—this is why it is called "possessing alone." The teaching of the great person is like form to shadow, sound to echo, yet does not take the lead in all under Heaven—this is how they become its counterpart. Dwelling in noiselessness, one remains serenely distinct from the self. Those who desire what aligns with the self and reject what differs from it take standing out from the crowd as their aim. Yet those who take standing out from the crowd as their aim—when have they ever truly stood out? Following the many to attain tranquility in what one has heard is not as abundant as the many skills of the many. Yet those who wish to govern others’ lands grasp at the profit of the Three Kings while failing to see its peril—this is relying on luck to govern others’ lands. How often can one rely on luck without losing others’ lands?

In preserving others’ lands, success is less than one in ten thousand; in losing them, one failure brings ten thousand losses. How lamentable that those who possess lands do not understand! Those who possess lands possess great things. Possessing great things, one must not be possessed by them. Being a thing yet not a thing, one can thus master all things. Understanding that the master of things is not a thing—how could this apply merely to governing the world and its people? Moving in and out of the six directions, roaming the nine provinces, coming and going alone—this is called "possessing alone." One who possesses alone is called most noble. The teaching of the great person is like the shadow following form, the echo responding to sound. When questioned, they respond, exhausting what is in their heart-mind, becoming the counterpart of Heaven and Earth.

Dwelling in noiselessness, moving without fixed direction. Leading you to the ceaseless flux of returning, roaming without bound; entering and exiting without side, sharing no beginning with the sun. Praising and discoursing on the form and body, merging with the Great Harmony—great harmony without self. Without self, how could one obtain what is called "having"? Those who weave the threads of having were the noble ones of old; those who perceive nothingness are friends of Heaven and Earth.

Guo’s Commentary: Those whose hearts desire to emerge from the crowd as mere stragglers all take standing out as their aim, which is why the multitude cannot surpass one another. When all take standing out as their aim, yet I alone go along without divergence, this is the greatest distinction from the crowd and becomes the master of the multitude.

My singular hearing cannot match the multitude of skills; thus, following the many brings tranquility, while defying them makes their thousands and tens of thousands all my adversaries. Those who seek to govern others’ lands do not rely on the people’s self-governance but impose their own will—this is merely chasing the profit of the Three Kings’ dominion without seeing the exhaustion of their own exertions. What the Three Kings profited from was not their own doing; they simply followed the self-governance of all under Heaven! To monopolize all under Heaven with one’s own will is to block its flow—how then can one’s own path remain open? Thus, the self remains unfulfilled while myriad things are lost. How lamentable! The lords of lands do not comprehend this.

Those who possess great things cannot be possessed by things. To say one cannot employ things is to be a thing oneself—unfit to possess great things. Those who employ things are not employed by things; thus, they are no longer things. Being no thing, they govern the things of all under Heaven, illuminating their self-governance without exhaustion.

People all distinguish themselves, yet I alone roam in simplicity—this is to come and go alone, to possess this solitude alone. Yet by merging with the profound sameness of the many, not seeking to impose upon them, the many cannot but esteem me—this is the highest esteem! If one clings to partial views, taking singular distinction as one’s aim, then even if aligned with a single purpose, one remains but a thing among the vulgar—not one who possesses solitude. The hearts of the common people are forms and sounds; the teachings of the great are echoes and shadows. What intent does the great one hold toward all under Heaven? Only to let each being’s aspirations fully unfold. The questioner is the host; the respondent, the counterpart. Abiding in soundlessness, one silently awaits things; moving without fixed direction, one follows their transformations. Lifting and guiding the myriad things to return to their self-moving nature—this is the perfection of non-action. Roaming without bound, one merges with transformation; entering and exiting without side, one attains profound sameness without distinction, ever renewing with the sun. Thus, there is no beginning or end. Praising and discoursing on the great one’s form and bearing finds no difference from Heaven and Earth. With a self, one cannot attain Great Harmony. The difficulty of all under Heaven lies in the self; once the self is dissolved, what need remains to possess possession?

Those who perceive having were the noble ones of old, merely embellishing their names; those who perceive nothingness are friends of Heaven and Earth, allowing their solitary life to unfold.

Lü’s Commentary: The Dao’s non-action and spontaneity are not only for the ruler to embody—even those who assist rulers with the Dao must follow the many to attain tranquility, without presuming to govern others’ lands. One person’s hearing cannot match the multitude of the many’s skills, yet to take it upon oneself to govern others’ lands is to risk losing all but by sheer luck. The rise of the Three Kings and the mutual accord of ruler and minister were indeed based on this profit, but later ages often saw it as exhaustion. Those who seek to govern others’ lands grasp at its profit without seeing its exhaustion.

The Yellow Emperor’s inquiry of Guangcheng and Yao’s meeting with the Four Masters all took great things as exhaustion, merely to clarify that those who govern things are not things themselves. What I embody is the Dao; beyond the Dao, there are no things—thus, I call it solitary possession. The great one’s teachings are like forms and sounds to echoes and shadows, not preceding all under Heaven—this is how they become its counterpart. Abiding in soundlessness, one silently faces the many’s thousands and hundreds as adversaries—how can one person’s hearing surpass theirs? This is why it cannot match the many’s multitude of skills!

When Yunjiang raved and the people followed wherever he went, all took standing out as distinction—until disaster befell birds and beasts, calamity reached insects. Was this not grasping the Three Kings’ profit without seeing their exhaustion? All that have appearance, image, sound, or color are things—how can things differ from one another? Thus, to illuminate that those who govern things are not things is to realize that the five viscera are not things. When the heart is not a thing, it can govern things; governing things is not merely governing things but also preserving the great thing, riding clouds and driving dragons, entering and exiting the Six Directions, coming and going alone. Those who possess great things cannot be without them. Not being a thing means not possessing them. If I can be no thing, and what enables me to be no thing is itself not a thing, who then harbors the intent to stand out? Not standing out from the many is truly standing out. When the heart does not stand out from the many, it does not possess its possession, and in truth returns to solitary possession; it does not esteem its esteem, and in name returns to the highest esteem. This is what Laozi meant by "not dwelling, not departing, without self yet accomplishing self."

The shadow has no sentiment toward the form, yet when the form stands, the shadow appears; the echo has no sentiment toward the sound, yet when the sound arrives, the echo responds. Its appearance—crooked or straight—lies not in itself but in the form; its response—clear or muddy, great or small—lies not in itself but in the sound. The great one’s teachings are like this: when questioned, they respond, fully expressing their thoughts without confusing the foolish. They serve as the counterpart to all under Heaven, not its master. Abiding in soundlessness, their silence suffices to respond to things; moving without fixed direction, their action suffices to encompass things. The ceaseless flux of returning is akin to observing the unconstrained with ease. Roaming without bound is akin to wandering through the beginning and end of things.

Form is the substance of life; the body, a distinction of form. Praise delights in life; discourse investigates its root. Merging with Great Harmony, Heaven and Earth are born together, the myriad things become one—how could there be the burden of a self? Bi Xu’s Commentary: The great one is the general name for the sage. The great one, through the Dao of self-governance, lifts and guides the myriad kinds, moving in accord with their nature and returning to their source. The Dao has no beginning or end, ever renewing without oldness. Praising the great one’s bearing finds it merging with the Dao. When the self is obscured, things are concealed; self and things are both forgotten—how could there be possession?

The noble person of humanity has yet to forget form; only one who forgets the self can transform things. Fu Zhai observes: Desiring others to be the same as oneself and disliking difference is to place oneself above the multitude. Insisting that all must conform to what one has heard before one can be at ease—though one seeks to stand out, one does not surpass the crowd. To claim unique insight, one must first ensure that none among the multitude knows. If one demands that all be the same as oneself, then one’s skills are no greater than those of the multitude. Seeking to govern another’s state in this manner is to seize the gains of the Three Kings while ignoring the harm that follows—like relying on luck to rule, seeing only ruin and never success. Those who hold states do not know their people and are thus deluded by such men. This is a clear rebuke of the itinerant persuaders of the time.

One who objectifies things has intent and exertion; one who does not objectify acts through non-action and spontaneity. Through non-action, nothing is left undone—thus it is called "not objectifying," and thus one can objectify all things. If one knows that objectifying things is itself not objectifying, then how could governing the world be the limit? Moving in and out of the Six Directions, roaming the Nine Provinces—this speaks of the Dao transcending the bounds of the myriad things. Operating freely within the workings of creation, one becomes one with Heaven, beyond human division. Thus, to come and go alone is called "possessing alone," and in this, one attains the highest nobility. The "great one" is precisely such a person of solitary possession.

Form must cast a shadow; sound must evoke an echo—this is the principle of nature. When questioned, I pour forth all that is in my heart in response. Facing the world thus, one’s single self bears the weight of all under Heaven. I am the host; the response is the guest—without echo, without sound, without scent, without direction, without advance.

*Naonao* describes the ceaseless flux of things. To lift and guide all the people of the world into this ceaseless flux is to act within the world without being apart from it—thus, the worldly and the transcendent are not two separate laws. Without beginning, without periphery—both are boundless. If one cannot see the start, how can one know the end? Judging by the form of the body, within the space between Heaven and Earth, all share this same form. Since one is the same as the myriad things, there is no self—what, then, is there to possess?

The noble ones of old saw only what was present. Only when one befriends Heaven and Earth does one perceive the absence. The "noble ones of old" include all from Yao and Shun downward. To dislike difference and favor sameness, to value oneself and belittle others—this is the common sentiment of those who seek to stand out. If one rejoices when the multitude aligns with oneself, then one is no different from the multitude—how has one ever stood out? Seeking to govern another’s state in this way is to covet past gains while blind to future harm! How often does luck not lead to the ruin of another’s state? For every state preserved, ten thousand are lost—this is an extraordinary flourish of the brush.

Alas for those who hold land yet do not know! Land is a great thing, yet one who possesses it without attachment can thereby govern all things under Heaven. If one clings to it, one becomes a servant of things. If one can perceive that the one who objectifies things is not themselves an object, then how could governing the world be the limit? Moving in and out of the Six Directions, roaming the Nine Provinces—this is the meaning of riding clouds and driving dragons, journeying through the Four Seas. Thus, one comes and goes alone, with no equal among things, possessing the Dao alone—what could be more noble?

The great one’s teaching is like form and shadow, sound and echo—responding as soon as questioned, never opposing the people’s wishes. As a counterpart to all under Heaven, one does not presume to be the host but remains the guest. The response arises from resonance, not from seeking. Dwelling without echo (read as *xiang*), one is present everywhere. Moving without direction, one goes everywhere.

The phrase "lifting you to follow the ceaseless flux" is difficult to explicate, and various interpretations have not clarified it well. Carefully examining the text’s intent, it aligns with the *Daodejing*’s idea of "who can be still and gradually give life to movement." Thus, the great one’s teaching lies in movement that transforms things, roaming without beginning or periphery, ever renewing without end.

"Praise and discourse" is akin to discussion. Discussing the great one’s bearing, one finds it in harmony with Great Unity, no different from the Dao—this is the meaning of the *Daodejing*’s "the bearing of profound virtue follows only the Dao." Many interpretations fixate on the words "praise and discourse," leading to incoherence in what follows.

The great one has no self; with the self gone, what thing could remain? The noble person pursues learning, aspiring to the Dao, and thus cannot yet forget things—all they see is presence, like the butcher who, at first, sees only the ox. The noble ones of old were like this; the noble ones of today can be inferred. Thus, one longs to behold those who perceive absence and honor them. Perceiving absence, one abandons learning and attains the Dao, like the butcher who, after three years, no longer saw the whole ox.

Heaven and Earth are born from absence. To perceive what gives birth to Heaven and Earth is to befriend them—this is no exaggeration. As for one whose virtue accords with nature, whose Dao transcends form, who roams the Eight Extremes, moving between being and non-being—such a one can grasp Heaven and Earth, seize yin and yang. How could mere friendship with them suffice? Thus, Master Kangjie said: "Heaven and Earth emerge from me—what else is there to say?"

The character *xiang* (响, "echo") originally had no alternate reading, but here it seems discordant with the following text and should be read as *xiang* (向, "direction"). *Xiang* means "direction." In the *Yangsheng zhu* ("The Secret of Nurturing Life"), *xiao ran xiang ran* is read like *xiang* ("echo"); in the *Yingdiwang* ("The Lord of Responses"), *xiang ji qiang liang* is glossed by the old commentary as "like an echo, swift as the response to sound." Thus, the two characters were interchangeable in ancient times, and here the confusion with the earlier *xiang* ("echo") following *sheng* ("sound") is an error.

The thirty-second scroll of *The Ocean of Meanings in the True Scripture of Southern Florescence* concludes here. #1 In the *Imperial Digest* (vol. 364), *jué* (爵, "rank") is written as *què* (雀, "sparrow"), and the same applies below. #2 In Zhao the Remonstrator’s edition, both instances of *xī* (僖) are written as *xiān* (仙).

The thirty-third scroll of *The Ocean of Meanings in the True Scripture of Southern Florescence*
by Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin

**Chapter Four: "In Yu" (Nurturing That Which Is Within)**

That which is base yet cannot be left unassigned is *things*;
That which is lowly yet cannot be left unaccommodated is *the people*;
That which is hidden yet cannot be left undone is *affairs*;
That which is coarse yet cannot be left unpresented is *law*;
That which is distant yet cannot be left unoccupied is *righteousness*;
That which is intimate yet cannot be left unexpanded is *benevolence*;
That which is regulated yet cannot be left unaccumulated is *ritual*;
That which is centered yet cannot be left unexalted is *virtue*;
That which is singular yet cannot be left unchanged is *the Dao*;
That which is numinous yet cannot be left unenacted is *Heaven*.

Thus, the sage observes Heaven yet does not assist it,
accomplishes virtue yet is not burdened by it,
emerges from the Dao yet does not scheme,
unites with benevolence yet does not rely on it,
diminishes righteousness yet does not accumulate it,
responds to ritual yet does not taboo it,
engages with affairs yet does not decline them,
orders by law yet does not disorder it,
depends on the people yet does not belittle them,
and follows things yet does not abandon them.

Things are sufficient to be acted upon, yet they cannot be left unacted upon.
One who is not enlightened by Heaven is not pure in virtue;
one who is not permeated by the Dao has no means to proceed;
one who is not enlightened by the Dao—how lamentable!

What is the Dao?
There is the Dao of Heaven, and there is the Dao of Man.
That which is revered through non-action is the Dao of Heaven;
that which is burdened through action is the Dao of Man.
The ruler embodies the Dao of Heaven;
the minister embodies the Dao of Man.
The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of Man are vastly distant—this cannot be left unexamined.

Guo’s commentary states: If one follows their nature and assigns them accordingly, there is order; if one reverses their nature and imposes upon them, there is chaos. Assigning the base leads to honor; accommodating the lowly leads to esteem—this is the natural tally of things. Affairs are hidden in their own realm, and each acts on its own; they cannot be left undone, but one should merely follow and assign them. Law is the edge of wondrous affairs—how could one, on account of its coarseness, fail to present wondrous affairs? One must occupy it, for this is what makes it distant. Intimacy suffers from partiality, thus expansion is necessary. Ritual and regulation risk being bound to singularity; if one embodies them in each thing, they accumulate and become all-encompassing. That which is below affairs, though centered, is not virtue; that which is difficult in affairs, though singular, is not the Dao. Clinging to intent without acting, though numinous, is not great—how much less so for that which is not centered, not singular, not numinous! Thus, the sage follows their spontaneous action, naturally uniting with the exalted. Without scheming, it is singular—this is what makes it unchanging. Relying on duality prevents expansion. Following one’s nature to occupy the distant is not accumulation. Naturally responding to ritual is not due to taboo; engaging with affairs through ritual, each acts according to its capacity, responding to movement with movement, without refusal or deference. Governing the coarse with the wondrous thus avoids disorder. Depending on the people’s spontaneous action without belittling their use, following things to their proper task without abandoning their root—this is the way. As for acting, how could one act merely because it is sufficient to do so? One inherently embodies this action and cannot cease it. Without enlightenment, there is action, and with action, virtue is not pure. Unable to empty oneself to await things, affair after affair loses its harmony—this is the lamentable state of one unenlightened by the Dao. The Dao of Heaven assigns the spontaneous action of the myriad things; the Dao of Man is burdened by action, unable to follow its own attainment. Aligning with Heaven’s assignment of things according to their nature, residing above things and each fulfilling its proper role—the ruler practices non-action and delegates to the hundred officials, while the hundred officials each have their duties, and the ruler does not intervene. Both attain spontaneity through non-action, yet the ruler’s Dao is at ease while the minister’s Dao is toilsome—the disparity between ease and toil cannot be spoken of in the same breath.

Lu’s commentary: Man is noble and things are base; though base, they must be assigned and cannot be left unassigned. Thus, one follows things without abandoning them, for their baseness means they are not worth acting upon yet cannot be left unacted upon—their action merely assists their spontaneity. The ruler is exalted and the people are lowly; though lowly, they must be accommodated, for even Heaven’s seeing and hearing depend on them—thus, one depends on the people without belittling them. That which adapts to change is called *affairs*; without foreseeing what has not yet come to pass, one cannot know their hiddenness—thus, one engages with affairs without declining them. That which is established and employed is called *law*; law is not the wondrous Dao, yet the world takes it as its standard—thus, one orders by law without disorder. Benevolence is what the noble person embodies and practices; benevolence is near while righteousness is distant, yet without righteousness, benevolence cannot act alone. Though distant, it cannot be left unoccupied—thus, one diminishes righteousness without accumulating it. Benevolence originates in filial piety and fraternal duty; righteousness benefits things. Righteousness is distant while benevolence is intimate, yet intimacy is limited to father and son—even tigers and wolves share this, which is not the ultimate. Thus, one unites with benevolence without relying on it. Ritual takes regulating the people’s hearts as its affair, yet there is nothing it does not pass through—thus, it cannot be left unaccumulated. One responds to ritual without taboo. Virtue is what is shared by nature; one who is not enlightened by Heaven is not pure in it—thus, one accomplishes virtue without being burdened by it. There is nothing that is not the Dao; this is what makes it singular, yet without change, the myriad things’ responses are not complete—thus, one emerges from the Dao without scheming. Non-action is how Heaven is numinous; to have non-action is not the entirety of non-action—thus, one observes Heaven without assisting it.

The preceding discussion sought to abolish sagely wisdom, cast aside benevolence and righteousness, and with the ends of tally-symbols and measuring scales, desired to burn, break, sever, and obliterate them without remainder. Yet from the subtleties of the Dao of Heaven to the hidden coarseness of affairs and laws, none can be absent. Why is this?

The numinosity of Heaven lies in this: with a single warming breath, the myriad things flourish; with a single cooling exhalation, the myriad things wane—yet its way of completing things is one and the same. Such was the insight of Zhuangzi. What was said before describes the moment when a single exhalation leaves the myriad things empty; what is said now describes the moment when a single warming breath fills the myriad things. Both serve only to complete things. Is this not how one embodies the numinous and enters into Heaven?

The Dao is one and nothing more. If one is not enlightened by Heaven, one cannot achieve non-action and remains impure in virtue—how much less can those below humanity force themselves to it? The Dao encompasses both Heaven and humanity; if one does not penetrate it, neither non-action nor action has any basis, and if one does not penetrate it, how much less can one be enlightened by it? Non-action governs things; action is governed by things. The Way of Heaven is non-action, and thus it is revered; the Way of humanity is action, and thus it is burdened. Zhuangzi was no shallow dabbler in worldly affairs or one given to action, yet he spoke so earnestly of this—having observed the principles of Heaven and Earth and the effects of past and present, he knew that gains and losses invariably lay therein.

*Dubi’s Annotation:* Things are the basest of entities, yet one does not refuse to let them follow their nature because of their baseness. The people are the most humble, yet one does not reject their constant nature because of their humility. To refuse things their nature is to have no things; to reject the people’s nature is to have no people. Can the world do without people or things? If affairs are not undertaken, they decay and become difficult to revive; if they are not concealed, they become too manifest and harm the Dao. Laws that are not coarse remain unknown to the people; if they are not displayed, the age does not fear them.

Righteousness is a path—distant, yet one may wander upon it. Benevolence is a dwelling—near, yet one may reside within it. Yet righteousness cannot be uninhabited, for one cannot be without benevolence. If benevolence is not expansive, there is no way to broadly bestow and relieve the multitude; if it is not intimate, love lacks gradation. If ritual is not moderated, it becomes licentious and lawless; if righteousness is not accumulated, it remains thin and insubstantial. If virtue is not lofty, it cannot distinguish itself from the multitude; if one does not hit the mean, one cannot reach the same end as those who are sufficient. Unity pertains to number, the dispersion of the Dao; change is inexhaustible, the transformation of the Dao. If the Dao had no number, scholars could not exhaust it; if it did not change, all ages would suffer its ills. If Heaven were not numinous, its works would not be wondrous; if it did not act, things would not be completed. As *Mencius* says: "That which is done without anyone doing it"—this is it.

These ten principles follow the sequence from application to embodiment. The sage aligns with Heaven, thus observing Heaven’s spontaneity without assisting it. Virtue arises from nature, and thus one completes it without being burdened by it. Scheming refers to pointing at affairs and speaking of them—how could one respond to things by pointing at affairs? Meeting is the natural convergence of things. Reliance is when the heart depends on something. When one harmonizes with benevolence and unites with nature, there is nothing to rely upon. Righteousness is acting in accordance with principle. Taboo is speech that violates the heart. To be thin in righteousness yet not accumulate it is great righteousness. To respond to ritual without taboo is great ritual. When affairs are accomplished, one engages with them without refusal; when laws are established, one orders them without disorder. The people are the foundation of the state—one relies on them without轻视 them. Things are the resources of the nation—one employs them without discarding them.

This passage speaks of the sage’s sequence from embodying the Dao to putting it into practice, following nature and complying with it. Things arise from the Dao, and the Dao governs things. The sage acts for the Dao, not for things, yet things naturally attain their fulfillment—thus, nothing is worth doing, yet nothing can be left undone. As *Xunzi* says: "One who is precise about things manages things; one who is precise about the Dao encompasses all." The more one manages things, the more one should seek precision in the Dao and not be enslaved by things.

Those of old who spoke of the Dao first clarified Heaven, then followed with virtue and the Way. By understanding what lies in Heaven to seek what lies within oneself, one becomes pure in virtue. If one does not penetrate the Dao, there is nowhere one does not encounter obstruction. The great Dao disperses and gives rise to the division between Heaven and humanity. The ruler practices non-action and resides above—this is the Way of Heaven. The minister practices action and resides below—this is the Way of humanity. Heaven is natural; humanity is made to be so. There are those who are human yet not Heavenly, but there has never been one who is Heavenly yet not human.

*Xiang Dao’s Annotation:* There are things, then there are people; there are people, then there are affairs; there are affairs, then there are laws. Enacting laws lies in righteousness; enacting righteousness lies in benevolence. Ritual is what moderates and adorns righteousness. From this, one reaches the mean, and virtue cannot but be lofty; the Dao cannot but be unified; in the end, Heaven cannot but be acted upon numinously.

This is the progression from humanity to Heaven. When one proceeds from Heaven to humanity, virtue is naturally attained; the Dao is applied to things; the people possess things; things exist for the people. One who is not enlightened by Heaven is harmed by humanity and thus impure in virtue; one who does not penetrate the Dao is muddled by affairs and thus has no basis for action. If one is not enlightened by the Dao, how can one penetrate it? The root lies above, the branches below; the essential lies with the ruler, the details with the ministers. Thus, a skilled carpenter does not act upon the wood itself but acts in wielding the adze; a skilled charioteer does not act in arranging the steps but acts in grasping the reins. How then can a ruler share the same tasks as his subordinates? How can a minister share the same virtue as his superior?

The *Classic* says: "Observe words with the Dao, and the rulers of the world are rectified; observe abilities with the Dao, and the officials of the world are well-ordered." The ruler sits and discusses—this is speech; the minister rises and acts—this is ability. Herein lies the distinction between action and non-action.

*Bixu’s Annotation:* There are no worthless things—one cannot call them base and refuse to employ them.

Man discards not man—one cannot call them lowly and refuse to employ them. Affairs have their manifest and hidden aspects—one cannot call them concealed and refuse to act. Laws value timeliness—one cannot call them crude and refuse to set them forth. Righteousness requires judgment—one cannot call it near or far and refuse to apply it. Benevolence is boundless love—one cannot call it partial and refuse to extend it. Ritual can order chaos—one cannot call it restraint and refuse to accumulate it. Virtue has its high and low—one cannot call it middling and refuse to elevate it. The Dao’s emptiness and nothingness—one cannot call it clinging to the One and refuse to change. Heaven’s principle is natural—one cannot call it numinous and refuse to act.

Observe Heaven yet do not assist its arrival; follow things yet do not abandon them—this reiterates the preceding ten principles. How can one speak of external things as trifling and unworthy of action when the needs of the living cannot be left unmet? Those who are blind to Heaven’s principle cling to ritual and law, stagnate in the familiar, and lose themselves in things—such people have no path to follow.

To speak without auspiciousness is how one attains reverence; to accept service and remain below is how one belongs to others. The king models himself on Heaven’s non-action; ministers serve their lord through duty. The Way of Heaven and the way of man differ in labor and ease—if one fails to discern this and inverts them, disorder begins here.

*Yongzhai* says: This passage conveys the idea that the refined and the coarse cannot be separated. The Dao is noble, things are base—how can man abandon things? The Dao is exalted, the people are lowly—how can a ruler forsake the people? Clarity is the Dao; when applied to affairs, affairs become obscure—yet how can one entirely abandon worldly matters? Thus, they cannot be left undone. The Dao is subtle, laws are coarse—how can laws be entirely discarded? Thus, they cannot be left unproclaimed. Speech on righteousness may distance one from the Dao, yet how can righteousness be abandoned? Thus, it cannot be left unapplied. Benevolent love, though not the ultimate Dao, cannot be forsaken—thus, it cannot be left unextended. Ritual has its forms and restraints, seeming to force the world—thus, it cannot be left unaccumulated. Virtue is what all people possess, yet there are places where one must stand on one’s own; though one may harmonize with the world, one cannot fail to rise above it. The Dao is unity with the natural—yet there are places where change is necessary, so it cannot be left unchanged. The numinous is what cannot be known; Heaven’s actions are inherently unknowable, yet human affairs cannot be left unattended—thus, they cannot be left undone.

To "observe Heaven yet not assist" means no room for force. To "complete through virtue yet not be burdened" is to accumulate and thereby ascend. This speaks of having no deliberate intent—no scheming, no calculation. No reliance, no self-regard as though one’s kindness were meager or pressing. To "accumulate" is not to transform; not to accumulate is to transform. No concealment, no taboos. No yielding, no retreat—this conveys simplicity and directness. Though the people may be relied upon, they are not treated lightly; though things may be leaned upon, they are not clung to, nor does one abandon the root for the branches.

From the earlier lines on the base not being left unengaged to this point, all has been expounded—yet it returns to the idea that things are not worth acting upon yet cannot be left undone. Here, "things" refer to the refined as Dao and the coarse as things, encompassing all matters and phenomena. If one’s mind is aligned with the Dao, are these not all unworthy of action? Yet there are those that cannot be left undone—this is where the human heart resides.

Moreover, those who do not understand Heaven do not perfect their virtue. Though worldly affairs cannot be left undone, one must also know the principle of the natural. If one does not understand Heaven’s natural principle, one’s virtue remains impure, and failing to align with the Dao is to be blind to Heaven—thus, one encounters obstacles everywhere. To be revered through non-action is Heaven’s natural Way; to be burdened through action is the human way, which cannot be left unattended. The former pertains to the mind of Dao; the latter, to the human mind. "Burden" is akin to "danger."

The ruler embodies Heaven’s Way, governing with the mind of Dao. The minister embodies the human way, making the human mind obey. These terms—ruler and minister—refer to the lord and subject within the self. As in the *Qi Wu Lun*, they take turns as ruler and minister, yet the true lord remains. From "the lowly cannot be left unengaged" to the end of this passage, this is the great guiding principle of the *Zhuangzi*, akin to the *Tian Xia* chapter.

Su Dongpo said: Zhuangzi never disparaged Confucius—this is evident in the *Tian Xia* chapter. I say: Zhuangzi never failed to understand the principle that the refined and the coarse, the root and the branches, are one—this is evident in this passage. This section begins with engaging things and following the people, embodying the meaning of "valuing the lowly as the root" and "taking the low as the foundation of the high." Next, it addresses affairs, laws, righteousness, benevolence, ritual, and virtue—none of which can be left undone, for they are the guiding principles of governance, indispensable even for a day. Then it speaks of the Dao as the One that cannot be changed—once grasped, all is achieved, and control rests with oneself. The existence or loss of the preceding eight principles is inconsequential, yet their wondrous function transcends these eight categories. It concludes with Heaven as the numinous that cannot be acted upon, for all proceeds from the natural.

From "observe Heaven yet not assist," it reverses the order of the preceding ten principles to return to the people and things, clarifying the reason for those ten so that scholars may know what to rely upon and not drift without direction. Nothing is more refined than the Dao; nothing is coarser than things. Yet in the end, it raises the idea that things are not worth acting upon yet cannot be left undone—thus, how difficult it is for man to part with things! But if one can understand Heaven, align with the Dao, and perfect one’s virtue, one need not abandon things, for things will not become a burden.

*Guan Yinzi* said: The sage does not abandon things but abandons attachment. Only those who do not align with the Dao find everything a burden. The Dao is but one. Yet here it distinguishes between Heaven and man to clarify the division of ruler and minister, just as primordial qi divides into yin and yang.

The alternation of yin and yang, the mutual dependence of Heaven and man—these cannot be neglected in isolation. Yet when it is said that they are far apart, this is to distinguish them in speech, thereby admonishing those who would be ministers under Heaven. Who would claim that the *Nanhua*’s discourse is solely about purity and emptiness, with no bearing on the Way of governance?

The general purport of this chapter is that when the noble person has no choice but to assume rulership over the world, nothing is better than non-action. Thus, they hold the preservation of the people and the accommodation of the masses in their hearts, never deliberately setting their minds on governing. As a result, the people’s natures remain uncorrupted, their virtue unaltered; those who stand above them keep their joy and anger balanced, their rewards and punishments just. They thereby rely on the world’s self-governance, sparing themselves the toil of governance. Thus, the people readily comply, and the law is not obstructed.

Later rulers of the world, having lost the essential means to assist the age and nurture the people, devoted themselves solely to rewards and punishments. Above, they were entangled in the disputes of the Confucians, Mohists, Zengzi, and Shun; below, they imposed the constraints of cangues and pillories. As a result, those who governed were overwhelmed with labor, while the people knew not where to turn. Yet they still believed that benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom sufficed to grasp the world’s true condition. They revered and cherished these virtues, passing them down through families and states, never realizing they were but tools to harass the people. This is why the *Nanhua* wished to cast them aside entirely.

If what is said here is true, then what the world entrusts itself to, what emerges from the profound and thunderous, lies in this: that state governance does not descend into vulgarity, that the people’s hearts do not rot. At ease in non-action, allowing the myriad things to be stirred and moved by their own breath—what leisure is there to govern the world?

Next, the question of Cui Qu is posed to elucidate the intent of Lao Dan, making clear that the fault of governance lies in ensnaring the people’s hearts. This is the origin of cangues and pillories, the very means by which Jie and Zhou wrought their harm. Thus, the Yellow Emperor inquired of Kongtong, who instructed him in the essentials of embracing the spirit, rectifying the form, and attaining long life through clarity and stillness. The body is the root; family and state come after. Never has there been a case where the body was well-ordered yet the state fell into chaos.

Were today’s rulers of the world to put into practice the words of Guangcheng, the governance of the Three Dynasties would not be difficult to restore. To take hold of Heaven and Earth, to oversee yin and yang—all lies within our non-action. This is the Way of *zai you*.

Hong Meng instructed Cloud General to cast off bodily attachments, dull his senses, guard the root without straying—this is the Way of cultivating the self. At the chapter’s end, it exhaustively examines the rituals and laws of rulers and ministers, arguing that the distinction between the Way of Heaven and the Way of man lies in the difference between action and non-action. Though they may seem unrelated, what arises in the heart and manifests in deeds is one and the same. It is only to illustrate the proper roles of ruler and minister, to rectify what each ought to do.

The *Highest* says: “The duke becomes king, the king becomes Heaven, Heaven becomes the Dao.”

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu, expounds:

Heaven and Earth are supreme, yet their transformations are uniform;
The myriad things are numerous, yet their governance is one;
The multitudes of people are vast, yet their lord is the ruler.
The ruler originates in virtue and is perfected by Heaven.
Thus it is said: The ancient rulers of the world practiced non-action—this was simply the virtue of Heaven.

Viewing speech through the Dao, the rulers of the world are rectified;
Viewing distinctions through the Dao, the righteousness of ruler and minister is clarified;
Viewing abilities through the Dao, the offices of the world are well-governed;
Viewing all things through the Dao, the responses of the myriad things are complete.
Thus, that which penetrates Heaven and Earth is virtue;
That which courses through the myriad things is the Dao;
That which governs people above is affairs;
That which possesses skill is technique.
Technique is encompassed by affairs, affairs by righteousness, righteousness by virtue, virtue by the Dao, and the Dao by Heaven.

Thus it is said: The ancients who nurtured the world had no desires, yet the world was sufficient;
They practiced no action, yet the myriad things were transformed;
They were profound and still, and the hundred clans were settled.
The *Record* states: “Penetrate the One, and the myriad affairs are complete.”
Without intention, one attains it, and ghosts and spirits submit.

Guo Xiang’s commentary: Heaven and Earth are uniform in non-action and transform of themselves;
The myriad things are one in self-attainment and thus well-governed.
The world may have diverse intentions, but the one without intention is its master.
Taking virtue as the origin, nothing fails to attain its due.
Attaining without gratitude is how Heaven is perfected.
Non-action means following the movement of nature;
To be a ruler by nature is not perverse.
Each abiding in its proper place: non-action occupies the superior position, action the inferior;
Offices attain their capacities, and governance is achieved.
When the superior practices non-action, the world responds in kind;
The myriad things all attain their due, Heaven and Earth are in communication, the Dao is unobstructed,
The myriad things follow their courses, each person attends to their affairs,
And technique is what things do not employ.
The root and branches encompass one another like the arm embracing the hand;
When the body is harmonious, the hundred joints are all unobstructed;
When the Dao of Heaven is smooth, root and branch are both unimpeded.
When one person hangs down their sleeves in profound silence, the hundred clans are at peace, and houses may be sealed—
Thus, with one act of non-action, all principles are universally upheld.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: Heaven and Earth are vast, their transformations endless, yet not by their own doing.
Uniformity admits no distinctions of great or small, beauty or ugliness, long or short—this is how transformation occurs.
The Dao generates the One and extends to the myriad things—how could governance arise from this?
Yet when each returns to its root without awareness, this is how governance is achieved.
Though the multitudes of people are vast, their lord is the ruler.
Originating in virtue, their transformations penetrate the uniformity of Heaven and Earth;
Perfected by Heaven, their governance reverts to the oneness of the myriad things.
These two are both called “mysterious.”
The ancient rulers of the world practiced non-action—this was simply the virtue of Heaven.
Thus, when the true ruler governs the world, could there be anything that does not transform?
Viewing speech through the Dao, there is never speech—speech that is no-speech—
Could the rulers of the world fail to be rectified?
Viewing distinctions through the Dao, non-action is for the ruler, action for the minister—
Could the righteousness of ruler and minister fail to be clarified?
Viewing abilities through the Dao, there is nothing one cannot or can do—
Could the offices of the world fail to be well-governed?
Viewing all things through the Dao, nothing is not the Dao—
Could the responses of the myriad things fail to be complete?
That by which Heaven and Earth are Heaven and Earth is simply this attainment.
When a person attains this, their virtue communicates with Heaven and Earth, and the myriad things are none other than oneself.
The Dao as a thing is like this: the great above employ it to govern people—this is merely affairs.
Those who possess skill—this is merely technique.
Technique is encompassed by affairs, affairs by righteousness, righteousness by virtue, virtue by the Dao, and the Dao by Heaven—how fitting!
Truly knowing that all are encompassed by Heaven,
How could one who nurtures the world dwell among technique, ability, affairs, or action?
Thus, that the world is sufficient, transformed, and the hundred clans settled lies within oneself.
To penetrate the One and attain this is because of the absence of intention.
The myriad affairs all issue from the One;
The numinosity of ghosts and spirits issues from one’s own heart.

Lin Yidu’s commentary: The myriad things are born of Heaven and Earth;
Humankind is the most numinous among them.
Heaven and Earth have not departed from form;
Humankind is the utmost of form, innumerable in its complexity—
Yet all take the Dao as their宗!
Their transformations are uniform, as the *Book of Changes* says: “It encompasses the transformations of Heaven and Earth without omission.”
Their governance is one, as the world’s movements are rectified by the One.
Their lord is the ruler—few are those whom the many take as their宗.
The ruler of humankind originates in virtue and is ultimately perfected by Heaven.
“Mysterious” is where numbers arise; Yang Xiong said the One generates the Three Powers.
The “mysterious ancient rulers” refer to those before the Three Sovereigns;
Non-action is how they accorded with the virtue of Heaven.
Above, they practiced non-action, issuing commands only to rectify those below;
Below, they practiced action, exhausting their efforts to serve those above.
Viewing their issued commands through the Dao, the rulers of the world are rectified.
To distinguish and regulate is called “distinction.”
To esteem goodness is called “righteousness.”
When the few rulers govern the many people, their noble and base, toil and ease are all distinguished and regulated—
Viewing this through the Dao, their righteousness is clarified.
Viewing abilities through the Dao, the offices of the world are well-governed,
As *Mencius* says: “The capable are in their posts.”
Viewing all things through the Dao, the responses of the myriad things are complete—
Different paths converge, a hundred thoughts reach the same end.
The Dao has root and branch: the root establishes the body, the branch clarifies its use.
Zhuangzi’s roaming beyond the realm is not an exaggeration of his words—
It is how the body is established.

When the four observations lead into roaming within the realm, this is not because his words are too base—it is how its use is made manifest.

That which penetrates and unites Heaven and Earth is called “virtue/power.”
That which circulates through the myriad things is called “Dao/Way.”
Those who govern people by following principle above engage in adaptive affairs;
Those who possess some skill do so merely as technique.
Technique is the branch of affairs, thus it is subsumed by affairs.
Affairs are the branch of righteousness, thus they are subsumed by righteousness.
As for virtue/power being subsumed by the Dao/Way, and the Dao/Way being subsumed by Heaven—
All are rooted in the mutual dependence of root and branch.
Thus, the ancients who nurtured the world reached down to technique and up to Heaven.
Though the world’s hundred clans and myriad things are exceedingly numerous and vast,
Enabling them to be self-sufficient, self-stabilizing, and self-transforming
Is rooted in the Heavenly Dao’s non-action alone.
Thus, the luminous suffices to complete all affairs, and the obscure suffices to subdue ghosts and spirits.

Chen Xiangdao’s annotation: Heaven and Earth, though vast, equalize their transformations through non-action;
The myriad things, though multitudinous, equalize their governance through self-attainment.
Then how could the means by which the ruler governs people and concludes affairs lie outside this?
The ruler originates from the center and cannot but be exalted;
Virtue/power is perfected in the numinous and cannot but be enacted—
Yet Heaven’s enactment is in truth never enacted.
Thus, the ancients who applied the Dao/Way to the world did so by entrusting it to its spontaneity alone.
The ruler’s use of the world is through speech;
The minister’s being used by the world is through ability.
The union of ruler and minister has its righteousness;
The interactions of the myriad things have their responses.
Yet without the Dao/Way, speech is not rectified;
Without the Dao/Way, ability is not governed;
Without the Dao/Way, distinctions are not clarified;
Without the Dao/Way, responses are not complete.
Thus, all that appears in the realm of action is nothing but the Dao/Way.
Skill has its limits;
Technique has its craft.
Technique is subsumed by affairs, yet righteousness resides therein—
Because affairs are subsumed by righteousness.
Righteousness is subsumed by virtue/power, yet the Dao/Way resides therein—
Because virtue/power is subsumed by the Dao/Way.
When one understands the mutual inclusion of root and branch, essence and coarse,
Then ladders and thatch, tiles and pebbles are nothing but the Dao/Way;
People and the myriad things are nothing but Heaven.
For those who dwell in the world, what else is there to seek?
One need only extend this to nurture them.
When emotions are without desire, actions are without contrivance,
And nature’s profound stillness—only the uncontrived mind can achieve this.
Thus, within the One, the ten thousand are never not encompassed;
In the multitude of the ten thousand, the One is never not returned to.
As the *Tradition* says: “One who knows the One knows all without exception;
One who does not know the One cannot know anything.”
This is why the sage embraces the One as the world’s model,
And why lords and kings attain the One as the world’s rectification—
How fitting that the uncontrived mind attains it, and ghosts and spirits submit!
Chen Bixu’s annotation: Heaven and Earth, without contrivance, equalize their transformations;
Each thing governs itself, thus all is unified.
Though the multitudes pursue diverse occupations,
Only the ruler practices non-action—
Originating in non-virtue/power,
Perfected in spontaneity.
Heavenly virtue/power is self-governance, yet a wondrous efficacy resides therein.
Viewing the world’s teachings through the Dao/Way of spontaneity,
Those who are clear, still, and non-active—
Their rulers are surely rectified.
Where offices and duties do not overstep—
The righteousness of ruler and minister is clarified.
Where abilities match their tasks—
Their offices are surely well-governed.
Surveying the myriad things, all attain their proper responses—
Then all may be fully equipped.
The Dao/Way is empty and penetrating, ascending above;
Virtue/power is soft and compliant, descending below;
Righteousness flows and circulates through things;
Affairs respond and serve people;
Technique follows ability and responds to skill.
Thus, when technique is subsumed by affairs, there is governance;
When affairs are subsumed by righteousness, there is appropriateness;
When righteousness is subsumed by virtue/power, there is compliance;
When virtue/power is subsumed by the Dao/Way, there is penetration;
When the Dao/Way is subsumed by Heaven, it accords with spontaneity!
“Without desire, the world is sufficient”—these three phrases
Echo the *Daodejing*: “Without desire, the people are naturally simple;
Without action, the people are naturally transformed;
Favoring stillness, the people are naturally rectified.”
When these three are blended and penetrate the One Real,
Then affairs are all completed, and spirits all submit.
If the world’s movements are to be rectified by the One—
Its lord and ruler, though few, are the multitudes’ ancestral model.
The ruler presides over people and things, taking virtue/power as the root,
Yet ultimately perfecting it in Heaven.
The profound is where numbers originate—
Yang Xiong said: “From the One Profound, the Three Directions arise.”
The profound ancient rulers—those before the Three Sovereigns—
Practiced non-action, thus harmonizing with Heavenly virtue/power.
Above, they practiced non-action, only issuing commands to rectify those below;
Below, they acted with devotion, only exhausting their efforts to serve those above.
Viewing through the Dao/Way the words they issue as commands—
Then the world’s rulers are rectified.
To distinguish and regulate is called “distinction.”
To esteem goodness is called “righteousness.”
When the few rulers govern the many people, their noble and base, toil and ease are all distinguished and regulated—
Viewing this through the Dao/Way, their righteousness is clarified.
Viewing abilities through the Dao/Way, the offices of the world are well-governed,
As *Mencius* says: “The capable are in their posts.”
Viewing all things through the Dao/Way, the responses of the myriad things are complete—
Different paths converge, a hundred thoughts reach the same end.
The Dao/Way has root and branch: the root establishes the body, the branch clarifies its use.
Zhuangzi’s roaming beyond the realm is not an exaggeration of his words—
It is how the body is established.
When the four observations lead into roaming within the realm, this is not because his words are too base—
It is how its use is made manifest.
That which penetrates and unites Heaven and Earth is called “virtue/power.”
That which circulates through the myriad things is called “Dao/Way.”
Those who govern people by following principle above engage in adaptive affairs;
Those who possess some skill do so merely as technique.
Technique is the branch of affairs, thus it is subsumed by affairs.
Affairs are the branch of righteousness, thus they are subsumed by righteousness.
As for virtue/power being subsumed by the Dao/Way, and the Dao/Way being subsumed by Heaven—
All are rooted in the mutual dependence of root and branch.
Thus, the ancients who nurtured the world reached down to technique and up to Heaven.
Though the world’s hundred clans and myriad things are exceedingly numerous and vast,
Enabling them to be self-sufficient, self-stabilizing, and self-transforming
Is rooted in the Heavenly Dao’s non-action alone.

Thus, its luminosity suffices to complete the myriad affairs, and its profundity suffices to subdue ghosts and spirits.

Chen Xiangdao’s annotation: Heaven and Earth are supremely vast, yet their transformations are uniformly rooted in non-action; the myriad things are exceedingly numerous, yet their governance is uniformly rooted in self-attainment. How, then, could the means by which a ruler governs the people and concludes matters lie beyond this? The ruler originates from the center and cannot but be exalted; virtue is perfected in the numinous and cannot but be enacted—yet Heaven, in its actuality, has never acted. Thus, those of old who guided the world by the Dao/Way did so by entrusting it to its own spontaneity alone.

The ruler’s use of the world is through speech; the minister’s being used by the world is through ability. The union of ruler and minister has its righteousness; the interactions of the myriad things have their correspondences. Yet speech, without the Dao/Way, cannot be rectified; ability, without the Dao/Way, cannot be ordered; distinctions, without the Dao/Way, cannot be clarified; correspondences, without the Dao/Way, cannot be complete. Thus, all that appears in the realm of action is nothing but the Dao/Way.

Art has its limits; technique has its craft. Technique is subsumed by affairs, yet righteousness resides therein—because affairs are subsumed by righteousness. Righteousness is subsumed by virtue/power, yet the Dao/Way resides therein—because virtue/power is subsumed by the Dao/Way. When one discerns the mutual inclusion of root and branch, of essence and coarse manifestation, then ladders and straw, tiles and pebbles are nothing but the Dao/Way; humans and the myriad things are nothing but Heaven. For those who dwell in the world, what else is there to seek? One need only extend this principle to nurture them.

When emotions are without desire, conduct is without contrivance, and nature is profoundly still—only the one without a heart can achieve this. Thus, within the singular there is nothing that does not encompass the myriad, and in the multiplicity of the myriad there is nothing that does not return to the singular. As the *Tradition* says: "One who knows the One knows all things; one who does not know the One cannot know anything." This is why the sage embraces the One to serve as the world’s model, and why lords and kings attain the One to serve as the world’s standard. That the one without a heart gains it and ghosts and spirits submit is only fitting!

Chen Bixu’s annotation: Heaven and Earth are without a heart, and thus their transformations are uniform; each thing governs itself, and thus all are equal. Though the multitudes engage in diverse occupations, only the ruler practices non-action, originating from non-virtue and perfected in spontaneity. The virtue/power of Heaven is self-governance, wherein wondrous efficacy resides.

Viewing the world’s teachings through the Dao/Way of spontaneity: where there is clarity and stillness, non-action, the ruler is surely upright; where duties are not overstepped, the righteousness of ruler and minister is clear; where abilities are matched to tasks, the offices are surely well-ordered; where all things are surveyed and their uses obtained, the requisites may be considered complete.

The Dao/Way is emptiness and penetration, ascending above; virtue/power is softness and compliance, descending below; righteousness is flowing and circulating through things; affairs are responses and governance in service to people; technique is following ability in service to art. Thus, when technique is subsumed by affairs, there is governance; when affairs are subsumed by righteousness, there is harmony; when righteousness is subsumed by virtue/power, there is compliance; when virtue/power is subsumed by the Dao/Way, there is penetration; when the Dao/Way is subsumed by Heaven, there is union with spontaneity.

The three phrases—"without desire, the world is sufficient"—correspond to the *Daodejing*: "Without desire, the people return to simplicity; without action, the people transform themselves; favoring stillness, the people rectify themselves." When these three are blended and penetrate the One Real, then affairs are all completed, and spirits all submit.

Things suddenly and unconsciously flourish without awareness of their glory; when not manifest, they silently withdraw, shedding all traces. Lü’s annotation: The Dao/Way is so vast that the heart, if not restrained, cannot embody it. To embody the Dao/Way through non-action is to appear human yet be transcendent.

To love and benefit others by this is called "benevolence"; to attain unity by this is called "greatness." Conduct no different from the common, yet supremely magnanimous; possessing ten thousand differences, yet supremely abundant. The person who holds fast to virtue/power unites the One and completes the myriad, like the main cord in a net. When virtue/power is perfected, one stands without reliance; when the Dao/Way is within me, there is no response that is not complete. No thing can topple one—thus is one whole.

The ten matters by which the noble person restrains the heart are these: seeking within oneself to illumine the heart; embracing all great matters without exclusion—this is the effect of self-restraint. Flowing abundantly to the myriad things, circulating without cease—if thus, then hiding gold and pearls in mountains and abysses, one does not know the desirability of wealth and profit, nor the shame of early death. One does not monopolize the world’s benefits but stores them in the world alone. One does not regard ruling the world as a personal elevation; what benefits things is not oneself.

To be manifest is to be luminous; luminosity comes from virtue/power, not from position. Dwelling above, one embodies the virtue/power of emperors and kings; dwelling below, one embodies the Dao/Way of mysterious sages and unadorned kings. When the myriad things are complete within me, there is but one treasury. As things are born, they die; as they die, they are born—all are but the same form.

**Annotation on "Dwelling in Solitude":**
To refine the heart-mind is to dispel its desires and render it empty. Action belongs to humanity; non-action belongs to Heaven. Sun, moon, and stars revolve above; flying, walking, moving, and growing things intermingle below—yet their transformations arise without knowing how they transform, their achievements unfold without knowing how they achieve: this is non-action that acts. Speech is what the sage cannot avoid; this is non-action that speaks. Heaven is simply its spontaneity. Virtue is simply self-attainment. Love and benefit constitute benevolence; the capacity to harmonize constitutes greatness. One who is magnanimous can contain what cannot be stored; one who is abundant shares broadly in common. Holding fast to virtue without deviation establishes order; unity that can expand establishes virtue. Following the Dao/Way in action enables all affairs—this is called completeness. If nothing can thwart one’s resolve, then nothing is lost.

To comprehend these ten principles is to have a heart-mind that embraces all without limit, flowing abundantly with things, finding joy within. What can wealth, riches, honor, or rank move? Longevity or early death, success or failure—these are but secondary matters! Thus one does not regard worldly profit as possession, nor does one deem ruling the world as grandeur. If one takes this as manifest, then one is luminous; if not manifest, one remains naturally radiant day by day. The myriad things are a single treasury; life and death are but the same form—only then does one merge mysteriously with creation. None but those who embody the Dao/Way can attain this!

**Detailed Annotation on the Dao:**
When the myriad things are complete within me, to possess them without loss is to be abundant. When order dissolves, the eyes of the multitude grow confused; when virtue is lost, the conduct of the multitude strays. Thus following the Dao is called completeness; not allowing things to thwart one’s resolve is called wholeness. Veiling the heart-mind’s vastness is to grasp the great image. Flowing abundantly with the myriad things is to have the world come to you.

Those of old who brought the Dao/Way to the world did not advance by display, nor instruct by speech—they allowed others to attain it themselves. When superiors transform inferiors, there is no delight or bait to please; when inferiors delight in superiors, they do not come seeking favor. Hiding gold and pearls in mountains and abysses is not to burden the body with things; not calculating longevity or early death, success or failure, is not to sacrifice the Dao/Way for the self. The profit of an age is vast, yet one does not claim it as private; the power of the world is weighty, yet one does not regard it as personal elevation. Ultimately, the myriad things cannot differ from one, nor can life and death alter one—could any but the unburdened heart-mind achieve this?

**Blue Void’s Annotation:**
The opening phrase "The Master said" refers to Zhuangzi receiving the esoteric teachings of Chang Sanggong. The Dao is vast and flowing, filling the great void; only one whose numinous treasury is empty can contain it. Governing oneself to accord with nature, abiding in the center while speaking of far-reaching matters, one distances oneself from discouragement. Measuring life to engage with things, the heart-mind does not retreat. What others detest, I harbor no suspicion; harmonizing light and blending with the dust, one does not erect sharp edges. The ten thousand kinds flourish, together enriching the realm. Upholding utmost virtue as order, following utmost principle to establish well, aligning with true constancy without bias, and withdrawing from external appearances to preserve the inner—clarifying this to refine the heart-mind, then affairs are all encompassed, principles all contained, kindness flows abundantly, and things all attain their fulfillment!

Gold, pearls, and wealth are the roots of rest; longevity or early death, success or failure are inner afflictions; private gain and elevated status are emotional maladies. If the heart-mind is bound to any of these, then rest is incomplete.

**Yongzhai’s Explanation:**
To refine the heart-mind is to dispel its cognitive awareness. Action through spontaneity is called Heaven. What is attained in oneself is called virtue. Speaking of non-action means there is nothing to contain in speech. Differences are also harmonized—this is called harmonizing differences. Distinctions have traces. Things differ, yet I possess them all—this is called abundance. The virtue one holds has its own order—this is called discipline. Standing resolutely as if established is the completion of virtue. Following the Dao in action, nothing is incomplete; external things cannot move the heart-mind—then what is within me is whole. Comprehending these ten principles, all affairs are encompassed and return to my heart-mind. Thus the heart-mind’s greatness has no bounds, and it flows abundantly with the myriad things.

Hiding gold and pearls in mountains and abysses is to store wealth in the world. Not regarding longevity or early death, success or failure as honor or disgrace, not claiming the profit of an age as private—this is the principle of "when a man loses his bow, another gains it." Though one may rule the world, one does not consider oneself exalted; the imperial carriage is not one’s heart’s desire. The brightness within the breast illuminates heaven and earth—this is true manifestation, hence one does not regard ruling the world as manifest. Gathering the myriad things into one is called a single treasury. Life and death do not alter one—hence they are called the same form.

Heaven and earth do not themselves cover and support; what covers and supports is the Dao. The sage does not himself act or speak; what enables action and speech is the Dao. Vast and boundless! The Dao is present in all, yet without refining the heart-mind to emptiness, there is no way to contain it. Only when the chamber is empty does brightness arise.

The Dao of Heaven is non-action and spontaneity. If one can act through non-action, one accords with the Dao of Heaven. Speaking of non-action is self-attainment. Applying it externally is called transformation through love and benefit. Things differ, yet the seer is one—then what one possesses is great. Conduct that does not differ from things—what is this if not magnanimity? All affairs of the myriad things I possess—this can be called abundance! Holding virtue implies something grasped; when virtue is complete, it does not depend on grasping. It is through having order that one can establish. Following the Dao to great completeness, what can thwart one’s resolve? Truly understanding this principle, then the heart-mind suffices to conceal all affairs, moving together with things. The boundlessness of things is met with my own boundlessness—this is called becoming one with transformation, and thus one can transform others.

Ultimately, gold and pearls are useless when hidden in mountains and abysses; wealth, riches, and honor are all external things—then what can longevity or early death, success or failure, restrain? Could any but the unburdened heart-mind achieve this?

Not taking worldly profit as one’s private gain—this is forgetting profit. Not taking rulership of the world as one’s own glory—this is forgetting fame. Yet what truly shines forth lies in realizing that "the myriad things are a single storehouse, and death and life share the same form."

The myriad things being a single storehouse means no division of self and other; death and life sharing the same form means no burden of coming or going. Could this be the ultimate piercing of the heart-mind?

Master Guo takes "from what shines forth then clarity" as a phrase, and later interpretations largely follow this, though it seems disjointed from the following text. Master Wu Yinfan’s reading, which connects it to the subsequent passage, offers greater coherence. Here, we adopt his approach.

**Heaven and Earth (Part Two)**

The Master said: The Dao dwells in profound stillness, its clarity flowing and pure. Without metal or stone, there would be no sound. Thus, metal and stone possess voice, yet without striking, they do not resound. Who could fix the bounds of the myriad things?

The person of royal virtue moves with simplicity and feels shame in entanglement with affairs, establishing the root and origin while knowing communion with the numinous. Thus, their virtue is vast, and their heart-mind’s emergence is shaped by things. Therefore, form does not arise without the Dao, and life does not become luminous without virtue. To preserve form and exhaust life, to establish virtue and illuminate the Dao—is this not the person of royal virtue?

Vast and boundless! Suddenly emerging, suddenly moving, and the myriad things follow—this is the person of royal virtue. Gazing into the obscure, listening to the soundless: within obscurity, alone they perceive dawn; within silence, alone they hear harmony. Profound beyond profundity, they yet give form to things; numinous beyond numinosity, they yet refine essence. Thus, in their encounter with the myriad things, they meet all demands with utter emptiness, galloping through time to grasp their abode, whether great or small, long or short, near or far.

**Guo’s Commentary:** Sound arises from stillness, illustrating how one who embodies the Dao responds only when moved by things. Moving with simplicity, they do not seek entanglement with affairs. Establishing the root, their knowledge does not resist; thus, their virtue grows ever vaster, and their heart-mind emerges shaped by things, not preceding them in initiative. Sudden and impetuous—both describe their effortless response. Thus, they preserve form and exhaust life, establish virtue and illuminate the Dao, attaining royal virtue.

If one’s numinous hearing clings not to stillness, then harmony is lost in opacity. Only by plumbing the source can one give things their form; only by reaching utmost compliance can one exhaust subtlety. Firm in this, I entrust all to that, and their demands are met of themselves. Unfettered, I let them be, meeting only their ultimate limit.

**Lü’s Commentary:** "Dwelling in profound stillness" speaks of its depth and immobility; "its clarity flowing and pure" speaks of its pervasiveness and lack of turbidity. Such is the Dao! If one deems it non-existent, metal and stone cannot sound without being struck; if one deems it existent, metal and stone do not sound without being struck. Who could fix the bounds of the myriad things?

Simplicity means no admixture; passing away means no place it does not reach. Communion with affairs brings clarity to things; knowing communion with the numinous leaves nothing unpervaded. Why seek entanglement with affairs? The root is the Dao; affairs are its branches. Establishing the root, one enfolds affairs, and affairs naturally flow. The heart-mind, not probed by things, remains quiescent—neither pursuing nor resisting, responding without hoarding.

For the ear to hear, the eye to see, the mouth to speak, the heart-mind to think—all are the Dao. Thus, form does not arise without the Dao; in daily use, one remains unaware unless one possesses it within. Thus, life does not become luminous without virtue; only by preserving form and exhausting life, establishing virtue and illuminating the Dao, does one grasp it within and wield the ancient to steer the present.

Suddenly emerging and moving, the myriad things follow—this is to conceal all schemes and never force plans. Though the Dao as a thing is invisible, it is the source of all seeing; though inaudible, it is the source of all hearing. Profound, it yet gives form to things—within it, there are things. Numinous, it yet refines essence—within it, there is essence. Meeting all demands with utter emptiness, it is the inexhaustible wealth of heaven’s storehouse. Galloping through time to grasp their abode, whether great or small, long or short, near or far, their allotment is never insufficient—this is what the *Book of Changes* calls "each rectifying its nature and destiny, preserving the great harmony."

**Yi Du’s Commentary:** "Dwelling in profound stillness" speaks of the utmost depth under heaven; "its clarity flowing and pure" speaks of the utmost refinement under heaven. This uses the profundity of water to illustrate the Dao. Without metal or stone, there would be no sound—yet this depends on striking. Thus, sound arises from stillness, and resonance follows striking. So deep as to be unfathomable, who could fix the bounds of the myriad things?

Moving with simplicity, one embraces the unhewn and proceeds, thus not entangled in affairs. Affairs are the branches of the Dao; the numinous is its root. Abandoning branches to establish the root, one’s virtue is vast. "Shaped by things" means responding without initiating. Form does not arise of itself—what gives it life is the Dao. Life does not become luminous of itself—what illuminates it is virtue. Preserving form to illuminate the Dao is to fulfill form; exhausting life to establish virtue is to fulfill one’s nature. Thus, in their emergence and movement, the myriad things follow—this is the person of royal virtue.

Gazing into the obscure, they alone perceive dawn; listening to the soundless, they alone hear harmony—this is the ultimate of the Dao. Thus, profound, they yet give form to things; numinous, they yet refine essence. In their encounter with things, they meet all demands with utter emptiness, galloping through time to grasp their abode—this is why the Dao is inexhaustible.

**Detailed Daoist Commentary:** The Dao, through clarity and stillness, possesses the numinous—it does not respond without stimulus. Metal and stone, through clarity and stillness, possess sound—they do not resound without being struck. In its response, the myriad transformations push one another without fixed direction; in its resonance, the five tones vary endlessly. Who could fix their bounds?

To master things is to lose oneself; to reject affairs is to lose things. The sage follows things without delighting in mastery, engages with affairs without daring to refuse—thus they attain stability and responsiveness. It is like wood containing fire: without drilling, it does not ignite; earth containing water: without digging, it does not flow. Yet the utility of water and fire pervades all under heaven precisely because they respond.

*Laozi* says: "Know the masculine, guard the feminine." When the heart extends outward, something probes it. The world does not understand this, toiling endlessly with things as if they were affairs—becoming a corpse of names, a storehouse of schemes, a burden of tasks, a master of knowledge. Such folly leads to disordering heaven’s principles, inverting the nature of things, and forgetting oneself. Is this not lamentable?

Preserving form and exhausting life is not the same as forgetting form and life; yet those who forget form and life begin with preservation and exhaustion. Establishing virtue and illuminating the Dao is not the same as forgetting virtue and the Dao; yet those who forget virtue and the Dao arise from establishment and illumination. Thus, one need not act to share in the people’s fortunes and misfortunes. Suddenly, impetuously, the myriad things follow.

In obscurity, they perceive dawn—not with the eyes, but with spirit. In silence, they hear harmony—not with the ears, but with *qi*. Deeper still, they enter and discern things, yet remain able to shape them without losing themselves. This aligns with the *Yijing*’s essence: "Entering the numinous to achieve utility." More numinous still, they emerge and commune with things, yet remain able to refine them without being burdened. This aligns with the *Yijing*’s principle: "Using to secure the self and exalt virtue."

Profound yet able to shape things, they meet all demands with utter emptiness. Numinous yet able to refine essence, they gallop through time to grasp their abode. *Bixu’s Commentary*: Water, which nearly embodies the Dao, rests in stillness like a deep pool; when it moves, it flows with clarity—like metal and stone, which do not resound without being struck. Things have their nature; seeking them accordingly is how they may be obtained. To remain in unadorned simplicity, to feel shame at engaging with affairs—this is the root of standing firm, of returning to the root and reviving the mandate.

To comprehend the numinous is to know constancy, which is called illumination. Virtue extends everywhere; thus, in movement, one touches the true essence, and things come to probe it. The Dao’s body gives birth to things; virtue’s function makes it manifest. Those who skillfully preserve form must be able to exhaust life’s principles; those who skillfully establish virtue must be able to grasp the Dao’s subtleties.

Thus, virtue and achievement spread boundlessly—their emergence is formless, their movement traceless. In obscurity, they perceive dawn and hear harmony. A jade long hidden in a dark chamber gleams with radiance at night; spirit inwardly fortified shines with auspicious light in stillness. To shape things and refine essence is to speak of the wondrous and indistinct, the profound and true. To meet all demands with utter emptiness is to practice non-action yet leave nothing undone. To gallop through time and grasp one’s abode is to reach the extreme of movement and return to stillness.

Great and small, long and short, near and far—all are unified by the Dao alone. *Yongzhai* says: Metal and stone can resound, for this is heaven’s nature; that humans strike them is also heaven’s mechanism. How can one know what is called heaven is not human, or what is human is not heaven? "Unadorned simplicity" means to proceed in plainness. To feel shame at engaging with affairs is to be capable yet not act. The "root" is the origin of things.

When the heart extends outward, it responds to things—this is like being probed. All that has form and life shares this Dao, yet without self-attainment, the Dao remains obscure. To say one does not know how to preserve one’s form to exhaust the principles of life’s beginning, or to establish one’s virtue to illuminate the Dao’s spontaneity—this is beyond the capacity of anyone but the sage.

Suddenly, impetuously, they emerge at the head of the myriad things, compelled to move so that all things follow—like saying the myriad things behold them. Perceiving dawn and hearing harmony are but self-perception and self-hearing. Deeper still, they respond to things, able to be refined or coarse. What resides within them is emptiness, so their response to things is without self. Thus, with utter emptiness, they supply all things’ demands; in timely emergence, they grasp their abode—this cannot be fixed with a single word.

Whether great or small, long or short, near or far, this is the meaning of timeliness. "Near and far" should be read together to complete the sense. The Dao’s depth, its clarity—this is heaven. That metal and stone have sound is also heaven; that they are moved is human; that they are struck to resound is also human. Heaven and human mutually depend, manifesting in things—this illustrates the person of royal virtue, who proceeds in plainness and feels shame at engaging with affairs, not because they cannot, but because they await the stimulus to respond.

To stand firm in the root is like metal and stone becoming instruments. To comprehend the numinous is like sound residing in being struck. Yet within the sound, the sounding essence abides—how vast is such virtue! The heart, probed by things, extends outward—this is the meaning of responding to stimulus and achieving communion.

Thus, to preserve this form is to exhaust life’s principles; to establish one’s virtue is to illuminate the Dao’s spontaneity. Skillfully nurturing what lies within, when they emerge and act, how could things not follow? As for perceiving dawn in obscurity and hearing harmony in silence, their seeing and hearing surpass what ordinary people can attain. Profound yet able to shape things, things do not depart from the Dao; numinous yet able to refine essence, essence does not leave the numinous.

With utter emptiness, they supply all demands—empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever-renewing. Galloping through time to grasp their abode is the meaning of "the farther one goes, the more one returns." The conclusion with "great and small, long and short, near and far" is a striking literary flourish, showing that nothing escapes this principle. "Near and far" should indeed be read together, as *Yongzhai* observed.

The Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Water, ascended the Kunlun heights and gazed south. Upon returning, he lost his dark pearl.

Having sent Knowledge to seek it, he could not obtain it; having sent Li Zhu to seek it, he could not obtain it; having sent Chi Gou to seek it, he could not obtain it. Only then did he send forth Vague-Image, and Vague-Image obtained it.

The Yellow Emperor exclaimed: "How extraordinary! Can Vague-Image alone obtain it?"

Guo’s commentary: This illustrates how one attains the true—it shows that the use of knowledge is insufficient to grasp the true. With keen hearing and sharp sight, with eloquence and disputation, one strays ever farther from the true. Those who attain the true do not rely on deliberate effort; in the state of Vague-Image, one is immediately one with the true.

Lü’s commentary: North of the Red Water lies the utmost extremity of the mysterious. The Kunlun heights are the highest in form. Gazing south is to turn toward brightness and observe. The pearl, as a thing, cannot be sought through knowledge, perception, or speech—thus all sought it in vain. Vague-Image is neither non-being nor being, neither entangled nor obscured; this is how the dark pearl is obtained.

Yi Du’s commentary: Gazing south and returning, one seeks to recover the root through brightness, yet loses one’s true nature. Sending Knowledge to seek it, the true nature recedes further; using keen hearing, sharp sight, and eloquent speech to seek it—none succeed. Only by departing from form, relinquishing knowledge, dimming keen hearing and sharp sight, and forgetting speech—what is called Vague-Image—can one attain the true nature.

Bi Xu’s commentary: When the heart stirs, the true water loses its reflection; when one yearns for the heights, the supreme principle becomes estranged. Eager to return to the root, the wondrous Dao is already lost! That which is not keen of hearing—knowledge cannot match it; that which is not sharp of sight—vision cannot equal it; that which is not eloquent—speech cannot accord with it. Vague-Image is the state of indistinctness: when a person is without mind, they merge with the Dao; when the Dao is without mind, it merges with the person—this is merely called "obtaining" it. The Yellow Emperor’s exclamation, "Can Vague-Image alone obtain it?" implies that in truth, nothing is obtained.

*Fuzhai Oral Teachings* states: This speaks of seeking the Dao—not through keen hearing, sharp sight, or speech. As the Buddhist sutras say: "To seek the great perfect enlightenment with a mind of thought and deliberation is like trying to burn Mount Sumeru with a firefly’s flame." The dark pearl symbolizes the Dao; Vague-Image is the state of no-mind. Those who seek the Dao in the world often rely on knowledge, keen hearing, sharp sight, and eloquence, thereby losing their original true nature. They do not realize that there exists a knowledge beyond knowledge, a seeing beyond sight, a speech beyond words—these alone enable one to know all, see all, and speak all. The pearl symbolizes the mind’s perfect clarity; the dark signifies the mind’s wondrous function. Only by nurturing it in obscurity can its use be inexhaustible. Now, turning toward brightness to seek it—this is why it is lost. The three who sought it in vain all did so with intent. As for Vague-Image, form is also absent—how much more so the mind? Thus the dark pearl is obtained, eliciting the Yellow Emperor’s astonishment.

This pearl, all possess it—radiant through past and present, illuminating heaven and earth. In stillness, it congeals; in motion, it scatters. When the mind’s abyss is stirred by dust, its light is obscured; when the sea of nature surges, its place is lost. The body cannot even illuminate itself—how can it illuminate others? The Yellow Emperor initially believed that keen hearing, sharp sight, and knowledge sufficed to obtain the pearl, not realizing they were thieves of the pearl. Only after sending Vague-Image did he obtain it, thereby urging people to cast aside keen hearing, sharp sight, and knowledge, and return to the profound clarity of the sea of nature—then the dark pearl will appear of itself without seeking.

The steadfast should enter here. Yao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi. Yao asked Xu You: "Can Nie Que be entrusted with heaven? I would rely on Wang Ni to assess him." Xu You replied: "How perilous it is to burden the world! Nie Que’s nature is keen of hearing, sharp of sight, quick-witted, and surpasses others—yet he still receives heaven through man. He scrutinizes prohibitions against transgression but does not know the source of transgression."

Can he be matched with heaven? He rides upon man yet lacks heaven, founds himself upon the body yet diverges in form, exalts knowledge and races like wildfire, is driven by threads of affairs, ensnared by things, turns in all directions to elicit responses from them, and strives to meet every contingency. He transforms with things yet never attains constancy—how could he suffice to be matched with heaven?

Nevertheless, there are clans and there are ancestors; he may serve as a father to the multitude, yet cannot serve as the father of fathers to the multitude. Governance is the harbinger of chaos, the calamity of those who face north, the bane of those who face south.

To match him with heaven—being a Son of Heaven whose keen hearing and sharp sight surpass others—would compel people to strain after him, and employing knowledge to seek a return to spontaneity only deepens the error. Thus, the absence of transgression lies not in enforcing prohibitions but in relinquishing knowledge. Were he entrusted with the world, he would lead later generations to rely on knowledge and lose their authenticity.

To take the myriad things as one’s root is to unify all transformations and harmonize disparate forms—this is the proper course. Yet if later generations were to follow his example in controlling things, they would diverge from them. When the worthy occupy positions of precedence, knowledge and perception are exalted in their wake, spurring a frenzied race like wildfire. This gives rise to the inception of toil and service. Bound and constrained, they manipulate things, directing and mobilizing them to respond to the demands of superiors. Unable to forget goodness, they benefit others by meeting contingencies, yet in chasing after things, they find no inner fulfillment. Today they receive its virtue; tomorrow they bear its harm—never attaining constancy. How could this suffice to be matched with heaven?

There are clans and ancestors, meaning his deeds and kind may be emulated. A father to the multitude is but a trace; the father of fathers to the multitude is that by which the trace arises. Were he entrusted with the world, he would not merely be a ruler of governance but a harbinger of chaos. Jie and Zhou were not themselves capable of killing loyal ministers; rather, they relied on the periphery of sagely knowledge to bring about their ruin. By the same token, Tian Chengzi was not himself capable of usurping the state of Qi; rather, he exploited benevolence and righteousness to undermine it. Thus it is said: the calamity of those who face north, the bane of those who face south.

Nie Que’s nature surpasses others, yet he does not dismiss keen hearing or abandon knowledge to act only when unavoidable. In receiving heaven through man, he is not whole in heaven. He scrutinizes prohibitions against transgression yet does not know that transgression arises precisely from the act of prohibition. To deem this in accord with non-action and match him with heaven—how could it not result in elevating man at the expense of heaven?

Founding himself upon the body yet diverging in form, he cannot be without self. Exalting knowledge and racing like wildfire, he cannot relinquish knowledge. Thus he is enslaved by the world, entangled by things, and unable to free himself. Turning in all directions to elicit responses from things, he does not abide in stillness while the people remain unaware of where to turn. Striving to meet every contingency, he does not stand upon the root and origin, nor does his knowledge penetrate the numinous. Thus he transforms with things yet never attains constancy—how could he suffice to be matched with heaven?

Nevertheless, what emerges from non-action invariably begins with reduction. There are clans and ancestors, so he may serve as a father to the multitude, yet the one who reduces is not the source from which the father of the multitude arises—thus he cannot serve as the father of fathers. This is to say: the inability to be without knowledge is what divides Yao from Jie and marks the harbinger of governance and chaos. Thus, those who govern the state through knowledge bring about the calamity of those who face north and the bane of those who face south.

Nie Que’s keen hearing and capacious knowledge merely grasp the traces of the great Dao. In receiving heaven through man, he has strayed far from the spontaneity of nature. Transgression arises from keen hearing and sharp sight, and when knowledge is employed to prohibit it, transgression only proliferates and cannot be restrained. Founding himself upon the body yet diverging in form, he has not forgotten form. Exalting knowledge and racing like wildfire, he wearies the spirit in frantic pursuit. Driven by threads of affairs, he initiates toil and service. Ensnared by things, he employs knowledge to obstruct them. Turning in all directions to elicit responses, he makes things turn to him. Striving to meet every contingency, he responds to the suitability of things. Yet he has not merged with the transformations of creation, instead chasing after things and transforming with them—all of which departs from spontaneity. Knowledge is sometimes exhausted in exertion, sometimes in plumbing origins; bearing its virtue, he later inherits its harm—never attaining constancy. Though he strives to meet every contingency and transform with things, he does not know the root of the great Dao. Thus it is said: there are clans and ancestors, so he may serve as a father to the multitude, yet cannot serve as the father of fathers. The father of fathers is one who has an ancestor.

Attaining the truth of the Dao, there is no governance, no chaos. Acting through non-action, there is neither calamity nor bane. But if one pursues advancement and relies on sagely knowledge, one cannot escape becoming a calamity and a bane.

His governance is meticulous, and his people are deficient. Nie Que—he gnaws at things and leaves them incomplete. From "keen hearing and capacious knowledge" to "never attaining constancy" is the gnawing; from "the harbinger of governance and chaos" to "the bane of those who face south" is the incompleteness. Clan is that to which things return; ancestor is that from which they begin. Those who governed the people in antiquity never failed to employ keen hearing and capacious knowledge, yet their subtlety reached the point of divine martiality without killing—only then did they attain perfection. Now Nie Que merely possesses keen hearing and capacious knowledge—this is why he may serve as a father to the multitude yet cannot serve as the father of fathers.

Qian is the father of the myriad things—a father to the multitude. Great governance is the father of Qian—the father of fathers. A father to the multitude governs the world; the father of fathers embodies the world in truth. In freedom and ease, there is no governance, no chaos; in governance, chaos arises. Thus it is said: the harbinger of governance and chaos. Understanding this and facing north, one is no true minister—hence the calamity of those who face north. Understanding this and facing south, one is no true ruler—hence the bane of those who face south.

Relying on keen hearing and sharp sight brings little blessing; transgressing one’s nature brings much harm. To expect a response of pure whiteness with a heart of schemes and devices is to be far indeed—how could he be matched with heaven?

He, relying on the power of rulership, scorns the principles of heaven, exalts his own form, and hastens his intellect. He enacts laws to constrain things, surveys all affairs, responds to the myriad with the one, and pursues things without cease—how could this align with nature? Yet such unfolding has a beginning and an end!

When governance and teaching are strict and constricting, they cannot be wholly transcended. Such methods may quell crises and resolve disasters, yet they make it difficult to serve as a minister—this is what is meant by "governing the state through knowledge."

*Fuzhai notes: "Matching heaven" refers to ruling all under heaven.*

Keen hearing, sharp sight, quick wit, and agile responsiveness—these are his surpassing traits. He cultivates human affairs to correspond with heaven, thus it is said: "He receives prohibitions and transgresses as if clinging to the heart without transformation." Yet if one understands the source of transgressions, prohibitions become unnecessary.

Riding upon man without heaven, he knows *youwei* (action) but not *wuwei* (non-action). Confronting things with the self is called "rooting in the body yet differing in form." Exalting his knowledge and employing it urgently is like fire racing forth. Enslaved by trivial matters while forgetting the root is called "being driven by threads." Startled by things, he is constrained by affairs. Responding to every stimulus, he measures each by its own standard—thus swept away by things, he loses the constancy of his natural state and cannot stabilize his responses.

Though he may not match heaven, he still possesses worthy qualities. A clan gathers and honors its ancestors; the "father of the multitude" emerges from the many and may serve as their father, while the "father of fathers" stands yet a degree higher.

*Shuai* (to lead) refers to generalship—this man’s utility in the world may bring order or chaos. Whether as ruler or minister, both roles invite calamity.

This speaks of Nie Que’s keen hearing and sharp sight, his surpassing nature—discussing his talent without addressing his Dao. "Taking man to meet heaven" means striving through *youwei* to align with *wuwei*, discerning prohibitions and transgressions without understanding their source.

If entrusted with all under heaven, he would govern the people through the advance of *youwei*, causing the world to lose its natural nature. "Rooting in the body yet differing in form"—liver and gallbladder as distant as Chu and Yue. Exalting knowledge and racing like fire—his schemes hasten urgently. Driven by threads, he is enslaved by affairs; startled by things, he is hindered by them. Looking about, he responds to every stimulus, yet cannot forget the self. Adapting to the myriad circumstances, he still cannot forget things. If he merges with things, he is swept along by them; if he lacks constancy, he loses his original self. How could this suffice to match heaven?

Yet clans have ancestors—Nie Que’s learning also has its lineage and master. Though he once heard the Dao from those who dwelt in nests, he may serve as a "father of the multitude" but not as a "father of fathers." The "father of fathers" is what is called "mysterious and yet more mysterious." Precisely because he cannot be a "father of fathers," governing the world through *youwei* only brings chaos. Whether as ruler or minister, both roles inevitably invite disaster. Thus it is said: employing knowledge is insufficient to govern the world.

Nie Que was Xu You’s teacher, yet You would not permit him to "match heaven." Why? For "matching heaven" belongs to the study of outer kingship, while the four masters transmitted the Dao of inner sageliness. Outwardly, they served as teachers to emperors and kings; inwardly, they were "fathers of fathers." What need had they for all under heaven? Thus You did not praise Nie Que’s strengths but revealed his shortcomings, preventing him from aspiring like an ant and preserving his loftiness—this was the utmost respect for a teacher and the most earnest defense of the Dao! Scholars should seek this with their hearts.

*End of the Thirty-Fifth Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei.

**Thirty-Sixth Scroll of the** *Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei*

*#1: The character "由" is a misprint; the correct character is "田."*

**Heaven and Earth (Part Three)**

Yao observed the land of Hua. The border guard of Hua said: "Ah! A sage! I beg to offer blessings to the sage." "May the sage live long." Yao declined. "May the sage grow rich." Yao declined. "May the sage have many sons." Yao declined.

The border guard said: "Longevity, wealth, and many sons—these are what all men desire. Why do you alone not desire them?"

Yao replied: "Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; long life brings many humiliations. These three are not what nurture virtue, so I decline."

The border guard said: "At first, I took you for a sage! Now you are merely a gentleman. Heaven generates the myriad people and must assign them duties. If you have many sons and assign them duties, what fear remains? If you are rich and distribute it among others, what affairs remain?"

"The sage dwells like a quail and eats like a bird, moving like a crow without leaving traces. When the world follows the Dao, he flourishes with all things; when the world loses the Dao, he cultivates virtue and withdraws into seclusion. After a thousand years, weary of the world, he departs and ascends in weariness, riding those white clouds to reach the imperial homeland. The three calamities never arrive, and his person remains free from harm—what humiliation could there be?"

The border guard departed. Yao followed him and said: "May I ask a question?"

The border guard replied: "Withdraw!"

**Guo’s Commentary:**
"Having many sons and assigning them duties ensures all things find their place and minds are at peace. Distributing wealth and entrusting it to others, the world thus remains free from affairs. Dwelling like a quail, one seeks no settled comfort; eating like a bird, one relies on things to be sufficient, acting in accord with one’s nature, not following fixed paths. Flourishing with all things, one may wander wildly yet tread the great way. Cultivating virtue and withdrawing into seclusion, even the deeds of Tang and Wu—responding to heaven and following the people—are not without their intervals. Thus, when life reaches its utmost length, one endures the changes of prosperity and adversity, living by the heavenly course and dying by the transformation of things. Weary of the world and ascending in transmission, riding clouds to the imperial homeland, the dispersal of a single breath reaches everywhere. The three breaths never arrive—what humiliation could there be?"

**Lü’s Commentary:**
"The sage exhausts the heavenly Dao, thus embodying transformation without being burdened by things. The gentleman exhausts the human Dao, thus sharing fortune and misfortune with the people. Though longevity, wealth, and many sons are what men desire, he cannot but decline them as bringing many affairs, many fears, and many humiliations. Yao did not fail to exhaust the heavenly Dao; what he shared with others was merely exhausting the human Dao. Dwelling like a quail, he knew not where he abided; eating like a bird, he knew not whence it came. Moving like a crow without pattern, his traces were unseen. The teachings of spirit transmission—seeking it in dietary practices and breath control—are dismissed by worldly scholars as madness and not believed, but this is wrong. For one born embracing the spirit, even in death, one must embrace the spirit and not forget; born preserving heaven, even in death, one must preserve heaven and not fall. The *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* both speak of being in heaven—why then doubt ascending in transmission?"

**Yu Du’s Commentary:**
"The border guard of Hua, a keeper of its frontiers, offered blessings to the sage, wishing him longevity, wealth, and many sons, but Yao declined them all. He replied that many sons would enslave him to their burdens and bring many fears; wealth would enslave him to possessions and bring many affairs; long life would enslave him to existence and bring many humiliations. These three are insufficient to nurture the virtue of non-action and are merely the burdens of having life. The border guard said: 'At first, I took Yao for one who embodied the Dao as a sage, but now, tending toward nothingness, he is merely a worthy gentleman. If he has many sons and assigns them duties, what fear remains? If he is rich and distributes it among others, what affairs remain? Dwelling like a quail without fixed abode, eating like a bird relying on things to be sufficient, moving like a crow without pattern—all speak of his absence of intent. Flourishing with all things, he brings goodness to the whole world; cultivating virtue and withdrawing into seclusion, he perfects goodness in himself. Living to a thousand years, weary of the world and ascending in transmission—how could the three breaths ever arrive?'"

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:**
"Having many sons and assigning them duties lets each govern themselves; being rich and distributing it among others is like hiding gold and pearls in mountains and abysses. Dwelling like a quail without building nests, eating like a bird without seeking satiety, moving like a crow without lingering—flourishing with all things, he seizes the moment to act. Cultivating virtue and withdrawing into seclusion, he maintains feminine stillness and self-guard. Shedding the dust of years, he treads the light and rides the void. White clouds symbolize the radiance of the Dao; the imperial homeland is the true realm. The blessings the border guard offered are what the world values, but Yao, unconfused, declined them. Following and asking again, the border guard said: 'Withdraw!'—perhaps hinting at the profound meaning of forgetting the self. Master Yongzhai said: 'Wealth, longevity, and many sons are what men desire, but those who study the Dao consider them unworthy of concern. Heaven generates the myriad people and must assign them duties—this means that upon birth, one has clothing and food. Distributing wealth means entrusting it to others. Dwelling like a quail without fixed abode, eating like a bird without seeking it, flying like a crow without leaving traces—all speak of absence of intent. Flourishing with all things, each attains its life. Cultivating virtue and withdrawing into seclusion means hiding when the Dao is absent. Weary of the world and ascending in transmission conveys the meaning of liberation. White clouds and the imperial homeland are the heights of emptiness and nothingness. The three calamities refer to youth, maturity, and old age, like the analogy of the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s river of sorrow. Yao still wished to ask, but the border guard did not answer, only saying: 'Withdraw!'"

Jie Yu hastened to avoid him, and the Old Man with the Woven Bamboo Staff departed upon arrival—both exemplify this same principle.

How great indeed was Yao as a ruler! His benevolence shone forth, his righteousness stood firm, his virtue was vast, and his transformative influence was boundless. Once the world was well-ordered, he roamed and observed the splendor of Hua. That border guard, too, had concealed himself in reclusion to delight in Yao’s Dao, thrice blessing the sage and offering the world’s supreme beauty in tribute, believing the Dao could be preserved in silence. Yet Yao consistently declined, knowing this was no way to nurture virtue. The border guard pressed further, deeming the Dao an excrescence—until he witnessed Yao’s nine sons and two daughters serving Shun in the fields, possessing the Four Seas yet not claiming them, living to one hundred and eighteen before passing away. How towering and boundless, transcending the three breaths of mortal life! The border guard’s discourse aligned with Yao’s advancement, making him, too, a follower of Yao. Yet how could his governance—peerless as heaven, divine as spirits, radiant as the sun, vast as clouds—ever be fathomed by a border guard?

"Without display" likely means "without adornment," referring to outward traces. When Yao ruled the world, Bo Cheng Zi Gao was established as a feudal lord. When Yao ceded to Shun, and Shun to Yu, Bo Cheng Zi Gao resigned his lordship to till the soil. Yu went to see him and found him plowing in the wilds. Yu hastened to stand downwind and asked, "In the past, when Yao ruled the world, you served as a feudal lord. When Yao ceded to Shun, and Shun to me, you resigned your lordship to plow—what is the reason?" Zi Gao replied, "In the past, when Yao ruled the world, he did not reward yet the people were encouraged; he did not punish yet the people stood in awe. Now you reward and punish, yet the people grow unkind. Virtue has declined from this, punishments have been established from this, and the disorders of later ages begin from this. Sir, why do you not depart? Do not hinder my work." He bent low to plow, paying no further heed.

Guo’s commentary: In Yu’s time, three sages succeeded one another, governance was perfected, and virtue was complete. Yet as merit and beauty gradually receded, historical records had little to record. Even Confucius could not hear of it, which is why, though possessing the world, Yu did not cling to it—this was having yet not having. Thus, judging by the era, Yu was the most excellent; assessing the men, though three sages, they were fundamentally one with Yao. As no sage appeared in the times, the world’s heart suddenly turned to Qi. The supremely impartial, occupying their rightful place, entrusted the world to the people. Taking and giving were not their own, so they neither sought what was lost nor declined what was gained. They took it in an instant, received it with compassion—thus, though reviled by the reclusive scholars of Kangjie and ranked among the Three Kings, it is no wonder.

Zhuangzi used this to illustrate how corruption arose under Yao and took form under Yu—how much more so in later ages without sages? He entrusted this distant message to Zi Gao, causing him to abandon governance and return to the soil, aiming to abolish sagacity and return to unity, to discard knowledge and attain tranquility. Yet in truth, he had not heard of it.

Zhuangzi’s words cannot be confined to a single interpretation. Some take the Yellow Emperor’s advancement as surpassing Yao and Shun’s governance—was he merely exalting Yao while disparaging Yu? Thus, one should set aside his allusions and focus on his intent to abolish sagacity and discard knowledge.

Lü’s commentary: The ancients praised Yu as the Divine Yu. If his virtue reached the divine, then compared to Yao and Shun, there should be no gap—so "not rewarding yet the people were encouraged, not punishing yet the people stood in awe." That "rewarding and punishing yet the people grow unkind" was merely a matter of the times. Those who spoke thus aimed to show that governing the world with virtue renders rewards and punishments truly unavoidable.

Yi Du’s commentary: Bo Cheng Zi Gao served as a feudal lord under Yao, but under Yu, he retired to plow in the wilds. This is because Yao governed the world with non-action, so the people did not require rewards or punishments to be encouraged or awed. Now, with Yu employing rewards and punishments, the people grow unkind, virtue declines, punishments are established, and the disorders of later ages begin from this. "Sir, why do you not depart? Do not hinder my farming." He exerted himself in plowing, no longer turning back.

Xiang Dao’s commentary: The people of remote antiquity were sincere yet unaware of their loyalty, proper yet unaware of their trustworthiness. They did good without seeking fame, unaware of any encouragement; they did evil without fearing punishment, unaware of any deterrence. Though Yao did not reward or punish, the people were encouraged and awed—yet compared to those unaware of encouragement or awe, this was already a decline. How much worse to reward to encourage and punish to deter! This is why virtue declined and punishments were established.

In truth, Yao did not entirely lack rewards or punishments. Rewarding one person delighted the world—that is skillful rewarding. Punishing one person subdued the world—that is skillful punishing. Few rewards and punishments, yet widespread delight and submission—this can be called not rewarding and not punishing. Hua Feng held Yao to the standard of a sage, while Zi Gao held Yu to Yao’s standard. Yu’s view of Yao was profound, but Yao’s view of the sage was profound beyond profound.

Bi Xu’s commentary: Yao, Shun, and Yu’s governance of the world was like the Dao, virtue, and the sevenfold benefiting all people—their benefits were vast and broad. Yet Bo Cheng Zi Gao’s discourse was lofty, his will unyielding to convention, his integrity unbending. Truly, he was the teacher of kings! Having spoken, he returned to plowing, bending low without a backward glance, embodying the intent to prioritize agriculture, honor fundamentals, return to simplicity, and revert to purity.

Yongzhai’s note: This shows how the world declined further in Yu’s time, already falling short of Yao and Shun. "Do not hinder my work" means "do not disrupt my plowing." *Lülü* describes the posture of bending low to plow. Yao did not reward or punish, yet now, with rewards and punishments, the people grow unkind—this emphasizes that rewards and punishments are inferior to their absence, akin to the intent of the *Yi*’s "no litigation." It borrows the Three Sages to make this point.

The above passage’s purport is clear, and the various commentaries are thorough—no further elaboration is needed.

In the Great Beginning, there was Nonbeing—Nonbeing without name. From Unity’s arising, there was Unity yet no form. When things obtained it to come into being, it was called virtue...

Before form arose, there was distinction—yet this distinction remained seamless, and this was called *ming* (destiny). When the abiding and the moving gave birth to things, and things attained their principles of life, this was called *xing* (form). When form and body preserved spirit, each possessing its own patterns and norms, this was called *xing* (nature). Cultivating nature returns one to virtue; when virtue reaches its fullness, it merges with the beginning. This merging is emptiness; emptiness is vastness. Voices harmonize in spontaneous utterance; when voices harmonize, they unite with Heaven and Earth. Their union is seamless, appearing foolish or dull—this is called *xuande* (mysterious virtue), merging with the Great Compliance.

Guo’s commentary: "Nonbeing" means there was nothing to name. "Unity" is the beginning of Being, supremely subtle yet without the form of material principles. That from which Unity arises arises from the utmost Unity—not from Nonbeing. *Zhuangzi* repeatedly speaks of "the beginning" because what has not yet been born attains birth, and this attainment of birth is difficult. Yet it neither relies on Nonbeing above nor depends on knowledge below, suddenly and spontaneously attaining this birth. Why then seek life after birth and lose the spontaneity of one’s own birth? Nonbeing cannot generate things, yet it is said that "things obtain it to come into being"—this clarifies that the birth of things is self-attained, and this may be called virtue. Virtue, form, nature, and destiny are named according to their transformations, yet in their self-so-ness they are one. Cultivating nature to return to virtue means attaining it spontaneously without contrivance. If one differs from the beginning by acting in the middle way, then one harbors something within, and with something harbored, the virtue of nurturing it is diminished. To speak without intention yet utter spontaneously is to harmonize with spontaneous utterance. When voices harmonize, they unite with Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth also act without intention, and their union is seamless—sitting in forgetfulness, they unite spontaneously, not through deliberate alignment. This is called *xuande*. When virtue is mysterious, what it complies with is vast.

Lü’s commentary: Without Nonbeing, even Unity cannot be attained. Without name, there is that from which Unity arises, yet no form—this is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Having already called it Unity, how can it be without name? That things obtain it to come into being is called virtue—this is the mother of the myriad things. Before completion, there was distinction, yet this distinction remained seamless, and this was called *ming*. *Ming* is without gap from the formless beginning. When the abiding and the moving gave birth to things, and things attained their principles of life, this was called *xing*. When form and body preserved spirit without loss, each possessing its own patterns and norms without deviation, this was called *xing*—nature that does not lose what follows the attainment of form. All this has no other source: the myriad things equally attain Unity to come into being. *Ming* has distinction yet no gap; *xing* preserves spirit without loss; spirit is that which subtly pervades the myriad things and fills the space between Heaven and Earth. Thus, cultivating nature to return to virtue merges with the formless Unity. When virtue reaches its fullness and merges with the beginning, even Nonbeing cannot be attained. This merging is emptiness, an emptiness extending to the state before things arose. Emptiness is vastness, a vastness extending to the point of not even merging with merging. In this way, speaking in terms of non-action, voices harmonize in spontaneous utterance. When voices harmonize, they penetrate Heaven and Earth and unite with them. The space between Heaven and Earth is like a bellows; when voices harmonize and unite with Heaven and Earth, it is like this. Their union is seamless—not a union of kindling, not a union of knowledge or perception. This is called *xuande*, originating in virtue and completing in Heaven. Merging with the Great Compliance means there is nothing to oppose.

Yu Du’s commentary: The Great Beginning is the origin of *qi*. As it had not yet taken form, it was called "being without." When things exist, names follow; here, there was nothing, so where could a name reside? "Unity" is what the Dao is named, what things are named by—neither attainable as being nor as nonbeing. That from which Unity arises arises from the utmost subtlety, before form existed. That things obtain it to come into being means that in receiving destiny, destiny lies within me—thus it is called virtue, the attainment of what lies within me. Before form, at the beginning of creation, there was already distinction and regulation. This distinction does not lie in things after they attain form; though there is distinction, it remains seamless—this is the *ming* of things. "Yet" (*qie*) signifies that this cannot be taken as constant. When things have life, they have form; life emerges from *ming*, form emerges from life. When humans have life, they share the same body as the Dao; when they have form, they share the same vessel as the Dao. The abiding and the moving—yin’s stillness and yang’s movement—give birth to things. When things are completed, their principles of life arise naturally. Thus, *ming* within me is called *xing* (nature); *xing* within things is called *li* (principle). Form is the image of the Dao. Form and body rely on spirit to exist; when they preserve their spirit, each possessing its own patterns and norms, this is called *xing*. *Ming* emerges before life; *xing* manifests after spirit. The world has long lost its nature, so the sage teaches the cultivation of nature. When nature is cultivated to the point of nothing left to cultivate, it returns to virtue. Returning to virtue, it darkly merges with the ultimate and unites with the beginning. The beginning is before things arose; without things, there is emptiness. Thus, merging is emptiness, and emptiness gives rise to an inexhaustible body—hence it is called vast. The vast does not act yet is never without acting, so voices harmonize in spontaneous utterance. Spontaneous utterance means acting without intention between speech and action. When voices harmonize, they unite with Heaven and Earth in their undertakings. Heaven and Earth unite with me, and I unite with them. Uniting with Heaven and Earth—how could this be achieved by knowledge? Seamless, like dullness, it unites spontaneously without intention. This is called the mysterious virtue, compliant in all directions—the ultimate of the sage’s Way.

Detailed Daoist commentary: From the Great Beginning to "without name" is a tracing upward. From "that from which Unity arises" to "this was called *xing*" is a tracing downward. Amidst the blur of primordial chaos lies the Great Simplicity. Transforming into *qi* is the Great Beginning. *Qi* transforming into form is the Great Origin.

Shape transforming into life is the Great Simplicity. Because there is the Great Beginning, there is Unity yet without form; because there is the Great Origin, things attain the principle of life; because there is the Great Simplicity, each possesses its own pattern and norm. That there is Unity yet without form—its essence is most true; that which is without form has distinction, and within it lies constancy. The "and yet" refers to what is coming but whose beginning remains unknown. Without interval, it is ever being born as it dies, ever dying as it is born. That which abides is yin; that which moves is yang. Things are born only after yin and yang abide and move. Principles become complete only after things are formed. The bodily form is what establishes and preserves the spirit; the spirit is what governs the bodily form and employs it. All things are complete within me, and none lacks the patterns, images, and norms that reside therein. This is what is called *xing*.

Only after there is virtue does there come to be *xing*. Thus, things first obtain life through it, and then each possesses its own pattern and norm. For humans, this is cultivation. From *xing* one attains the ultimate virtue, so only after *xing* is cultivated does virtue follow. The ultimate virtue is ultimately identical with the beginning. Identical, it becomes empty; empty, it becomes vast, and so returns to the state of an infant—this is the work of the *Great Person*. Harmonizing voices, voices harmonizing, and so attaining unity with Heaven and Earth—this is returning to simplicity, the work of the sage. In this unity, seamless and dull, like foolishness or stupidity, one returns to the boundless—this is the work of the *spiritual person*, reaching the divine where nothing can be added!

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:**
What has pattern is not the beginning; it is forcibly named the Great Beginning. Where Unity arises, there is still no advance; with advance, it pertains to primordial *qi*. The numinous and luminous thing that arises independently is called *virtue*. When *qi* descends yet no sign appears, the clear and turbid are already divided, and what is received is without interruption—this is called *ming*. In one stillness and one movement, the myriad things are transformed and born. Things attain the principle of life, and so this is called *form*. The bodily form preserves the spirit, and each has its own pattern and norm—this is called *xing*. Cultivating the natural *xing* and returning to the virtue of initial life, when virtue is identical with the Great Beginning, it becomes empty, vast, and boundless.

Harmonizing voices is like the union of the embryo; the union of the embryo is natural, and its utterance is without intention—this is what is meant by "speaking all day yet never speaking." The voice has upper and lower, like the union of Heaven and Earth. Closing the senses and shutting the gates, the wondrous principle is profoundly still; ultimate virtue is deeply obscure, identical with the Way of Great Compliance.

**Liu Yao’s Commentary:**
The Great Beginning is the beginning of *qi*, and so there is being and non-being. The Great Origin is the beginning of form, and so it is nameless. Where Unity arises, there are names; though Unity is yet without form, things obtain life because of this Unity. Without form, it is merely undifferentiated; yet once it can be named, the undifferentiated already has distinction. The "and yet" does not mean long-lasting stability. "Without interval" means beginning and end are like a ring, without any point that can be designated. "Within it lies essence, within it lies constancy"—this refers to the distinction of the formless. "Establishing virtue as if stealing" refers to the "and yet"; "continuous as if existing" refers to "without interval."

Now, when *ming* descends, if it does not abide, it is insufficient to give life to things; if it abides yet does not move, it is sufficient to give life to one thing but not to the myriad things. When it abides, it is never without movement; when it moves, it does not hinder its flow, and so it can give life to things. Things attaining the principle of life is called *form*; the bodily form preserving the spirit, each with its own pattern and norm, is called *xing*. With life comes *xing*; understanding *xing* profoundly is sufficient to know Heaven. Knowing Heaven, one returns to virtue; when virtue is perfected, one unites with the Dao.

**Yongzhai’s Sayings:**
The Great Beginning is the beginning of creation; what exists is merely non-being, and there is not yet this word "being." How could there be a name? This is where Unity arises. Unity is non-being, and so it is said, "There is Unity yet without form." Things obtain life, and so there is being. Each has its own being—all are virtue. "Without form" refers to the time when Unity arises. Though it has distinction, it cannot yet be divided, and so it is "and yet" without interval. "Without interval" is the "so it is"; "having distinction" is the "as if it were." This *ming* is Heaven’s *ming*, referring to the *ming* of *xing*.

Abiding and moving give life to things; primordial *qi* moves and, being born, becomes things—this is movement abiding here. Movement is yang; abiding and moving is stillness. Stillness is yin—this phrase contains the idea of yang generating and yin completing. Things obtain it and are born; once formed, the principle of ceaseless generation is complete. That the moving aspect of primordial *qi* becomes my life is called *form*. The bodily form preserving the spirit, each with its own pattern and norm, is called *xing*—this is what the *Book of Songs* means by "there are things, there are norms," and what the *Zuo Commentary* means by "the people receive the center of Heaven and Earth to live, possessing the norms of movement and majesty." All this is done by the spirit, which means that within *xing* there is the meaning of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom.

Cultivating *xing* to return to its natural virtue, when virtue is perfected, it is identical with the beginning of non-being. Identical with the beginning, it becomes empty; empty, it becomes vast. Having become empty and vast, there are words that are not spoken. Harmonizing voices is not speaking. Utterance is speaking. The "harmonizing" of voices harmonizing differs from the previous "harmonizing." When this utterance of voices is speaking without speaking, it unites with the natural. With this natural union, it unites with Heaven and Earth. Seamless, like dullness or stupidity—this describes this "uniting." This is the mysterious virtue, identical with the Great Compliance. Great Compliance is the natural principle of the Great Beginning. Before the sign of *qi* appears, there is neither being nor name; even calling it the Great Beginning is merely "there is" and "there is not"—it cannot be named or spoken. This is the formless Unity, the source from which Unity arises. Once Unity is established, there are names.

All things attain the One and thereby live, each possessing the virtue of the natural. The division of creative power, the descent of essence—this truly originates here, serving as the root of humans and things. Though their forms remain unseen, the clear and turbid *qi* they gather already bears distinction. That which humans attain makes them human; that which things attain makes them things. Yet even so, they remain uneven and disparate—all living things, myriad species, differ in kind, while the primordial *qi* flows without the slightest gap. This is called *ming* (destiny). What Heaven commands, things receive as their *ming*.

All this arises from the subtle workings of creation, its traces beyond scrutiny. Only the sage, penetrating transformation, can fathom it through principle. As for the ceaseless movement that generates things—once things take form and their vital principle is called *xing* (form)—then humans and things, moving and still, become clearly visible. The world takes this as the beginning, unaware of its distant origins.

Each thing possesses its own vital principle, yet only spirit governs it. Preserving one’s spirit ensures that proper measure naturally manifests. For where there is a thing, there is its norm—all arising from the expression of one’s inherent nature, the foundation upon which life stands. Nature requires no cultivation, yet what is called cultivation means not losing one’s proper measure, fully embodying Heaven’s endowment and returning to the virtue by which one was born. When virtue reaches its utmost, it merges with the Great Beginning. This is the reflux returning to the source, the union of humanity with Heaven.

Such union is emptiness—returning to the root. Emptiness is vastness; no thing can compare, and "vastness" is but a forced name. *Hui-ming* (harmonizing voices) carries the meaning of *gu-yin* (hub-sound). The crow’s call arises without intention; speech without intention aligns with *hui-ming*, and *hui-ming* in turn aligns with it. Heaven and Earth’s unintentional yet perfect response is just like this.

When humans unite with Heaven and Earth, it cannot be achieved through intention or effort—only by sitting in forgetfulness does it occur spontaneously. Thus, *min-min* (seamless), like dullness, resembles the mother and chick’s *qi* responding in perfect synchrony, unknowing yet so. This is the sign that virtue has reached unity with the beginning.

In this state, virtue becomes mysteriously identical, without division between Heaven, things, self, or others. Nothing in the world is more compliant than this. *Liu-dong* (ceaseless movement) is grammatically unsound—it should be *liu-dong* (flowing movement), meaning "movement" itself. The sound remains, but the character is corrupted.

**Heaven and Earth, Fourth Chapter**

Confucius asked Lao Dan: "There are those who practice the Dao as if emulating others—what is permissible they deem permissible, what is not they deem not; what is so they deem so, what is not they deem not. Debaters say: ‘Separating hardness and whiteness is like something suspended in the void.’ If this is so, can they be called sages?"

Lao Dan replied: "These are but clerks bound by petty skills, their bodies wearied and minds exhausted. The hound trained to catch raccoons becomes anxious; the monkey lured from the mountains by its agility loses its natural ease. Qiu, I tell you what you cannot hear and what you cannot speak. All things with heads and feet yet without minds or ears are many; those with form and those without form or shape—all exist in utter nothingness. Their movement is rest; their death is life; their decay is renewal. Yet this is not their true nature.

There is governance that lies in man: forgetting things, forgetting Heaven, its name is ‘forgetting the self.’ One who forgets the self is said to enter the Heavenly.

**Guo’s Commentary:** To force the impermissible into permissibility, the not-so into so, is to distort one’s nature and emotions. "Suspended in the void" describes something lofty and manifest, easily seen. The hound trained for raccoons and the monkey’s agility—these all lose their natural state. "Heads and feet" mean beginnings and ends. "Without mind or ears" means they transform of themselves. Things with form are prone to change and cannot coexist with the formless and shapeless; thus, those who skillfully practice the Dao do not cling to the old but follow the ceaseless renewal of transformation. Their movement and rest, death and life have no fixed constancy—they are simply as they are, not by any deliberate use. Thus, when released, they attain spontaneity. Governance lies in man, not in self-assertion. When Heaven and things are all forgotten, what remains beyond forgetting the self?

**Lü’s Commentary:** Permissible or not, so or not—this is to make equalizing things one’s task. Separating hardness and whiteness like something suspended in the void is to make disputation one’s task. If "is" is truly "is," then the difference between "is" and "is not" requires no debate. If "so" is truly "so," then the difference between "so" and "not so" requires no debate. Then why should "permissible or not, so or not" be deemed impermissible? Yet if one makes this one’s task, it is to know equality without knowing *why* it is equal. Does one not say, "Is it hard? Yet it is not worn thin by grinding"? Does one not say, "Is it white? Yet it is not blackened by dye"? Hardness and whiteness, though never truly separate, are made to seem as distinct as something suspended in the void—why then would this be impermissible? Yet if one makes this one’s task, it is to know disputation without knowing *why* it is disputation. Though these two approaches differ, they are but the toil of clerks bound by petty skills, their bodies wearied and minds exhausted—how could they be sages? To possess some skill is to weary the body; to be bound by thought is to exhaust the mind. The monkey’s agility wearies the body through skill; the hound trained for raccoons exhausts the mind through thought. What you cannot hear and what you cannot speak—these are things with heads and feet yet without minds or ears: in Heaven, the sun, moon, and stars; on Earth, mountains, rivers, and plants. All things with heads and feet yet without minds or ears do not prevent them from being the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, and plants. Why then doubt the mindless and emotionless in man alone? If they were truly without knowledge or emotion, then all things—those with form and those without form or shape—would be utterly nonexistent. Those with form are men and creatures; the formless are spirits; the shapeless is the work of creation. If these three had any trace of existence, they could not all coexist; that they all coexist is because they are utterly nothing. If they were utterly nothing, how could they be what you can hear or speak? Thus, their movement and rest, death and life, decay and renewal—these are not their true nature. Their true nature transcends the six senses—what use have they for equalizing or disputation? This is called chaos, not governance. There is governance, and it lies in man. Forgetting things, forgetting Heaven—its name is ‘forgetting the self.’ One who forgets the self is said to enter the Heavenly. Entering the Heavenly, there is governance without chaos.

**Yidu’s Commentary:** Some practice the Dao as if emulating others, imposing their own standards on things—permissible or not, so or not—unable to trust in the Dao, merely boasting of their ability to separate hardness and whiteness like something lofty and manifest, asking if this can compare to sages. The answer is that this is merely exchanging "is" and "is not," using such skills to bind the self, wearying body and mind—like a hound leashed for hunting or a monkey lured from the mountains, both having lost their natural state. Thus, I tell you what you cannot hear and what you cannot speak. "Heads and feet" are like Heaven and Earth; the profound subtlety of the great Dao cannot be fully expressed in words or sounds. Yet there are many things with beginnings and ends that, though spoken of, merge with the Dao without mind or ears. Those with form are the body; the formless and shapeless is the mind. All take these as existing, but I regard all that exists as nothing. Then their death and life, movement and rest, decay and renewal are but the principles of yin and yang’s ebb and flow—one does not know why it is so. Those who practice governance do so in man. If I forget things and forget Heaven, how could I busy myself with governing others? Forgetting both Heaven and things is called ‘forgetting the self.’ Thus, one merges with the principle of spontaneity—why then cling to the disputation of suspended distinctions?

**Xiang Dao’s Commentary:** Permissible or not, so or not—this is to invert one’s purpose. Separating hardness and whiteness like something suspended in the void is to multiply branches in disputation. The hound trained for raccoons becomes anxious because of its skill, thus unable to follow its own nature. The monkey lured from the mountains by its agility cannot rest in its natural ease. From this perspective, things with heads and feet yet without minds or ears are many.

When viewed from the perspective of nothingness, both the formed and the formless, the shapeless and all that exists, are utterly without residue. It is not that there is life and death, decay and rise—what makes these so is not their *so-ness*. Thus, the sage responds with nothingness.

If governance lies in others, that is all; but if it lies in oneself, then nothing is not forgotten. How much more so for those who contrive inverted abilities and stretch suspended distinctions in disputation!

**Bixu’s Commentary:** "Permissible or not, so or not"—this is adorning knowledge to seek difference. Separating hardness and whiteness like something suspended in the void, making all brightly apparent. Exchanging delusion for delusion, binding one another with skill, marring the body’s form, startling the mind’s repose—like a hunting hound leashed, a gibbon lured into a cage, all brought to rest through their own abilities. Those with heads and feet have visible forms; those without minds or ears remain unknowable. Without ears, they cannot hear; without minds, they cannot speak. The formed have heads and feet; the formless and shapeless have no minds or ears. That all exists means body and transformation merge in obscurity; that all is utterly without means there is no "without" to exhaust. Their movement and stillness, life and death, decay and rise—none of these are their *so-ness*. What then remains to be attended to?

Governance lies in others, but self-governance is all. Forget things, and you merge with things; forget Heaven, and you merge with Heaven; forget the self, and you become non-dual. What then cannot be entered?

**Yong Qi says:** The Way of governance, if imitated, reflects the intent of emperors and kings sharing a single thread. Using my "permissible" to clarify their "impermissible," using my "so" to clarify their "not so." Though the distinctions of hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference be manifold, I can discern them as if suspended in the void. Exchanging delusion for skill, bound by technique—this was explained in the previous section. "Anxious thoughts" arise from being bound by others; "coming from the mountains" means being captured by others. "Cannot hear," "cannot speak"—this is the meaning of "the nature and the Heavenly Dao cannot be heard." "Heads and feet" refer to the shared form of humans from crown to heel; "no mind, no ears" means no knowledge, no perception. The formless and shapeless, that which is spontaneously so—seeing the transcendent in the immanent, this is how the formed and the formless, the shapeless, all exist. "Utterly without" means such a person does not exist in the world. In all movement and stillness, life and death, success and failure, there is that which is spontaneously so—only one does not know it oneself. Relying on human affairs to govern, I remain without concern—hence, "governance lies in others."

Forgetting both things and Heaven is called "forgetting the self"; forgetting the self is entering spontaneity; entering spontaneity is becoming one with Heaven. Now, if someone imitates the governance of former kings, establishing laws and standards to regulate the masses, promoting teachings to guide the people—yet those laws do not accord with human nature, those teachings do not follow the principles of things—then they declare the impermissible permissible, the not-so so. This is what is meant by "separating hardness and whiteness like something suspended." Can such a one be compared to the sage? This is a critique of those in that era who, following Yang Zhu and Mo Di, took governance upon themselves and compared themselves to sages.

Lao Dan said: "This is like convicts in prison, exchanging abilities, binding one another with skill, laboring the body and disturbing the mind—no different from a hunting hound bound, a gibbon lured from the forest, all bringing calamity upon themselves through their abilities." This analogy reaches the height of contempt. What you cannot hear and cannot speak points directly to the subtle and profound obscurity of the Dao, to awaken the unenlightened.

Those with heads and feet are those who nearly stand between heaven and earth as humans. Those without minds or ears—those who cannot contemplate the Dao, cannot hear the Dao—are all too common. The formed is the human; the formless and shapeless yet all-pervading is the Dao. To utterly negate all is to reach the state of mutual forgetting, where what was previously called "unable to contemplate, unable to hear" becomes evident.

Their movements and stillness, life and death, decline and rise—these are but the vicissitudes of human affairs. If one clings to them as if governance lay solely in human hands, how could one enter the realm of heaven? Yet if one can forget things, then heaven and the self will forget each other without expectation. This is called "entering heaven," where the Dao harmonizes with nature, leaving no room for human artifice.

This chapter resembles the dialogue between Yang Ziju and Lao Dan in the "Responding to Emperors and Kings" chapter, differing only in the quality of their conclusions. Jiang Xun sought out Ji Che and said: "The Lord of Lu said to Qiao: 'I beg to receive your instruction.' Unable to decline, I had no choice but to speak. Yet I know not whether my words hit the mark—allow me to offer them for your consideration. I told the Lord of Lu: 'You must practice reverence and frugality, root out partiality and private interests, and promote those of public loyalty. Then what subject would dare not be harmonious?'"

Ji Che laughed with a shrug and said: "Your words, Master, in relation to the virtue of emperors and kings, are like a mantis raising its arms to block a chariot—utterly unequal to the task! Moreover, if one acts thus, one’s own position becomes precarious, like a high terrace attracting many visitors. Things will flock to you, and those who draw near will multiply."

Jiang Xun, startled, said: "I am utterly confounded by your words, Master. Nevertheless, I wish to hear the essence of your teaching."

Ji Che replied: "When the great sage governs the world, he sways the people’s hearts, transforming customs and shaping teachings. He eradicates their predatory impulses and advances their solitary aspirations, as if by nature’s own doing, so that the people remain unaware of how it comes to be. How could this be like the teachings of Yao and Shun, who led the people as if blindly following a guide? The desire to align with virtue must first reside in the heart."

Guo’s Annotation: One must practice reverence and frugality—not by forgetting frugality and merely restraining oneself. One must elevate public-spirited loyalty—not by forgetting loyalty and merely feigning it. Though free from partiality, this is still insufficient to counter the task of deceit and artifice. All such postures place oneself on high display, like a terrace or tower open to all eyes. They compel things to exceed their natural bounds, forcing them to contort and conform. Every step leaves a trace, unsettling the foundation of one’s own gait. Each will has its own inclinations; none can be imitated. Thus, one follows their natural sway and sways them—though swaying, it is not an act. One follows their natural drift and drifts with them—though drifting, it is not movement. Hence, predatory impulses vanish of themselves, solitary aspirations advance of themselves, teachings take shape and customs transform, all without trace. Nature is restored, yet none know how it came to be; all say, “It is simply our nature.” “Qijin” means self-reproach. One refuses to defer excessively to Yao and Shun, instead treating them as elder brothers. “The heart resides” means it does not chase externals, and thus virtue is aligned.

Lü’s Annotation: “One must practice reverence and frugality”—this is what is meant by suppressing one’s nature to observe the people, and thus one’s own position becomes precarious. “Elevating public-spirited loyalty”—this is what is meant by esteeming worthiness, and thus one’s terrace and tower become crowded. In this way, one cannot avoid leaving traces, and those who draw near will multiply. When the great sage governs the world, he sways and stirs the people’s hearts, transforming customs and shaping teachings—this is what is meant by “drumming and dancing them to exhaust their spirit.” If the people do not peer upward to follow the ruler’s path, then predatory impulses are eradicated and solitary aspirations advance, as if by nature’s own doing, so that none know how it comes to be. If this is so, then virtue surpasses that of Yao and Shun without effort—how could one treat Yao and Shun’s teachings as elder brothers, deferring to them in a murky, formless manner as if following behind? To align with virtue, the heart must reside within. When the heart resides within, there is non-action, and the myriad things transform.

Yi Du’s Annotation: Jiang Xun took reverence, frugality, and the elevation of public-spirited loyalty as the essentials of governing the people. Ji Che, however, saw that this could not accord with non-action and spontaneity, and so he laughed, bending slightly forward. Moreover, if one governs the state with such words, one places oneself in the highest position to stir the world’s attention, causing all things to flock to you, and those who gather beneath the terrace and tower will multiply. Startled by these words, Jiang Xun felt as if he had lost his bearings. He wished to hear the flow of the teaching, that it might reach him in the lower wind and transform him of itself. Ji Che explained that when the great sage governs the world, he follows the natural inclinations of the people’s hearts, like wind and rain swaying the myriad things, so that teachings take shape and customs transform. When external things invade and harm the good heart, it is called a “predatory impulse.” Once predatory impulses are eradicated, solitary aspirations advance. “Solitary” means having no counterpart and being unburdened by things, as if by nature’s own doing, so that none know how it comes to be. The common people say, “We use it but do not know it”—this is the governance of the spirit-like person. Yao and Shun are but dust, chaff, and husks, sufficient to mold and cast them. How could one treat Yao and Shun’s teachings as elder brothers and one’s own spontaneous Way as a younger sibling? To align with virtue, the heart must reside within. When the heart resides within, it does not chase externals.

Xiang Dao’s Annotation: “One must practice reverence and frugality”—this is not non-action. “Elevating public-spirited loyalty”—this is exalting worthiness. The virtue of the emperor-kings lies in non-action, so that the world knows no sighs of resentment; in not esteeming worthiness, so that the world knows no boastful strife. Thus, one follows their natural sway and sways them; one follows their natural drift and drifts with them. Hence, predatory impulses vanish of themselves, solitary knowledge advances day by day, as if by nature’s own doing, so that the people do not know how it comes to be. Now, if one makes reverence, frugality, and the elevation of public loyalty one’s task, this is to open the people’s Heaven and guide their predatory impulses, to warp Heaven’s Heaven and discard their solitary aspirations. How far this is from the virtue of the emperor-kings! Delicacies may please and cause passersby to stop, but their appeal is fleeting and cannot endure. A brief sip may suffice to prevent mutual forgetting, but its benefit is slight and cannot encompass the many. This is why the spirit-like person detests the multitude’s arrival and holds fast to the great image so that the world comes to him. As for drumming up the mantis’s defiant arms or erecting a precarious terrace and tower to make people rush together and follow the path—is this not the logic of delicacies and brief sips? In ancient times, Shun was burdened by his sageliness in a humble lane; Liezi was startled by the mirror-like clarity of his sincerity; Nan Guo Ziqi worried over knowledge and constant action; Gengsang Chu sighed over the burdens of the altars of soil and grain. The essential point lies in dwelling in shade to rest one’s shadow, dwelling in stillness to still one’s traces—only then is perfection attained.

Bi Xu’s Annotation: Reverence, frugality, and public-spirited loyalty are not non-action. Placing oneself in a precarious terrace and tower is not stability. Esteeming worthiness invites flattery. Leaving many traces invites falsity. When the people sway, the sage follows and employs them; when the people drift, the sage follows and settles them. When teachings take shape and customs transform, predatory impulses vanish of themselves, and each person advances their own aspirations as if by nature’s spontaneity. To treat Yao and Shun’s teachings as elder brothers is to honor their sagacity and wisdom; for the people to defer to them in a murky, formless manner is to lower themselves into scattered confusion. Now that the people are at ease in their spontaneity, why honor Yao and Shun’s sagacity and wisdom, causing the people to scatter and lose clarity? To align with virtue, the heart must have something to cling to—this is to have something to esteem, not spontaneity.

Yongzhai’s Note: The mantis’s defiant arms against the chariot’s wheel-tracks speak of small strength insufficient for great tasks. “One’s own position” refers to the ground of spontaneity. If one acts thus, it is like placing oneself in a precarious terrace and tower to attract the world’s gaze, causing all things to flock to you, and those who gather beneath will multiply—this is to be burdened by one’s reputation. “Swaying and drifting” mean transformation. “Predatory impulses” are the impulses of action. “Solitary aspirations” are the aspirations of solitary attainment. Once the people’s teachings take shape and customs transform, private impulses are eradicated and the Way advances, like innate knowledge of one’s nature, unaware of the ruler’s transformation. Taking Yao and Shun as lofty and oneself as secondary, one treats Yao and Shun’s teachings as elder brothers and defers to them.

The "mingxing" suggests a humble bowing of the head, a willing submission—when one aligns with the virtue of spontaneity, the heart finds peace. This is what the sage desires for the people. Those who transform things through action labor in their efforts; those who transform through non-action achieve far-reaching results. Uprooting public loyalty and erecting precarious terraces—these are transformations wrought by action. Eradicating predatory impulses and advancing solitary aspirations—these are transformations wrought by non-action.

"Swaying and drifting" is like stirring or inspiring, rousing the people’s hearts to shape teachings and reform customs. Guiding them with compliance and without obstruction—this is the beginning of transformation. Eradicating predatory impulses and advancing solitary aspirations is like administering medicine according to the illness—this is the middle stage of transformation. When it reaches the point where one acts as if by nature itself, and the people remain unaware of how it came to be—this is the culmination of transformation. The governance of Yao and Shun did not surpass this.

Why then elevate them as elder brothers and humbly defer as a younger sibling? "Mingxing" describes a state without distinction. If one desires to emulate the virtue of Yao and Shun, the heart becomes attached! All of this serves to uphold governance through action, sweep away the exaltation of Yao and Shun, and return to the intent of "rejecting sagacity and abandoning knowledge."

*The Thirty-Seventh Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei *concludes.*

*The Thirty-Eighth Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei
*By Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin*

**Heaven and Earth, Fifth Chapter**

When Zigong journeyed south to Chu and returned to Jin, he passed through Hanyin. There he saw an old man tending his garden, digging a tunnel to enter the well, then embracing a jar to draw water for irrigation. With great labor, he accomplished little.

Zigong said, "There is a device here that can irrigate a hundred furrows in a day, requiring little effort yet yielding much. Would you not desire it?"

The gardener looked up and asked, "How so?"

Zigong replied, "Carve wood into a machine: the rear heavy, the front light. Drawing water as if pulling, swift as boiling water—it is called a well-sweep."

The gardener flushed with anger, laughed, and said, "I have heard from my teacher: those who possess mechanical devices inevitably engage in mechanical affairs; those who engage in mechanical affairs inevitably harbor a mechanical heart. When a mechanical heart resides in the breast, purity and whiteness are incomplete. When purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit is unsettled. One whose spirit is unsettled—the Dao does not bear him. I am not ignorant of this, but I would be ashamed to act thus."

Zigong was taken aback, lowered his head, and made no reply.

After a while, the gardener asked, "What are you doing here?"

Zigong said, "I am a disciple of Confucius."

The gardener said, "Are you not one of those widely learned men who emulate the sages, boast to surpass the multitude, and strum mournful tunes to sell your reputation throughout the world? You are about to forget your spirit and qi, cast aside your form—yet you may still fall short! If you cannot even govern yourself, how can you govern the world? Be on your way and do not hinder my work."

Zigong, humbled and discomfited, lost his composure. After walking thirty li, he recovered.

His disciples asked, "Who was that man earlier? Why did you change countenance and lose composure, remaining unsettled for the rest of the day?"

Zigong said, "At first, I thought there was only one true man in the world—I did not know there was another like him. I have heard from the Master: in affairs, seek what is possible; in achievements, seek completion. To expend little effort yet accomplish much—this is the Way of the sage. Yet now it is not so. Those who hold to the Dao possess complete virtue; those with complete virtue possess complete form; those with complete form possess complete spirit. Those with complete spirit—this is the Way of the sage. Entrusted with life, they move among the people yet remain unaware of their destination, so profound and perfectly whole! They have forgotten the heart that seeks merit, profit, and cunning. Such a one does not pursue what his will does not incline toward, nor act on what his heart does not assent to. Though the world praises him, if it aligns with his principles, he remains unmoved; though the world condemns him, if it contradicts his principles, he remains unshaken. The world’s praise or blame neither benefits nor harms him—this is the man of complete virtue! As for me, I am but one tossed by the winds and waves."

Returning to Lu, he told Confucius what had transpired.

Confucius said, "He is one who falsely practices the arts of Master Hundun. He knows one aspect but not the other; he cultivates his inner self but neglects the outer. One who is clear and enters simplicity, practices non-action and returns to the uncarved, embodies nature and embraces the spirit, moving through the world—would you truly be so startled? Moreover, the arts of Master Hundun—how could you or I comprehend them?"

**Guo’s Commentary:**
What is used in accordance with the times is none other than perfect wholeness. To seek perfect wholeness by clinging to oneness and guarding the ancient is to miss the essence. If one neither forgets nor abandons, there is no path to near-perfection. The Way of the sage is simply to employ the hearts of the common people. The completeness of spirit is the Way of the sage-kings, not that of such a man. Zigong, hearing the discourse on perfect wholeness, submitted to it, yet he did not understand that the purely white are in harmony with the world. This is like the followers of Song Rongzi—they are not yet men of complete virtue. Zigong’s bewilderment before this man was like Liezi’s intoxication with Ji Xian. Confucius, seeing that he turned his back on the present and faced the past, ashamed to engage in worldly affairs, knew he was no true Hundun. He merely knew how to cultivate antiquity and embrace the simplicity of irrigation, unaware of the ease of following the times and responding to things. The true Hundun—how could he regard inner and outer as distinct and focus on cultivating only one? One who is clear and enters simplicity, practices non-action and returns to the uncarved, embodies nature and embraces the spirit, moving through the world—this is the true Hundun. Thus, he moves with the world, indistinct and without striving—how could he startle you? What the world recognizes is merely the outward trace!

**Lü’s Commentary:**
One who can wield the ancient to govern the present nearly makes daily life an extension of Hundun—how could this not be the state of heaven and earth’s beginning? He takes the presence of mechanical devices to imply mechanical affairs and a mechanical heart, yet does not know the origin of the mechanical heart. Before things ever existed, this is knowing one aspect but not the other. To know that forgetting spirit and qi and discarding form nourishes the completeness of virtue, yet not know that the Dao is present in all things—this is cultivating the inner but neglecting the outer. "Clear and entering simplicity... moving through the world"—this is what is meant by "discarding the heart and employing the form." When he heard Zigong’s words, he first grew angry, then laughed—rightly so, for he saw mechanical devices as a burden and refused to use them. Not knowing and not acting is how one becomes Hundun. This chapter discusses the heavenly virtue of non-action, lest some suppose that one must practice non-action like the old man of Hanyin, making it impossible to engage with the world. Thus, it speaks of the true extension of Hundun, who moves through the world without being burdened.

**Yu’s Commentary:**
*Huahuaran*—the appearance of exerting effort. The front is light to enter the water; the rear is heavy to lift it. The *tan* is the subtlety of movement; the *xie* is the mechanism manifest in the device. The mechanism appears in action, yet all arises from the heart. Mechanical affairs are external; the mechanical heart is internal. Whatever exists externally originates within. The heart, master of the center, values emptiness. Things must not be mixed; colors must not be stained—hence, "purity and whiteness." If the mechanism stirs within, things become mixed, colors become stained—thus, purity and whiteness are incomplete, the essence is disturbed, and the spirit is unsettled.

The spirit is that which bears the Dao; if it is unsettled, it becomes borne by things instead. I am not unaware of the device of the well-sweep—it is merely that I disdain to employ it.

From broad learning to selling one’s reputation throughout the world, all this aims only to be known by others. Forget the qi, and the heart becomes empty; abandon the bodily form, and the self is forgotten—only then may one approach the Dao. If you have not yet attained this, your own person remains untended; how then could you govern the world? You should depart now and not hinder my affairs.

"The One Man of the World"—this refers to Confucius. Yet he did not know there was another man, namely the Old Man of Hanyin. Confucius embodied the Dao of utmost loftiness, which Zigong could not comprehend, and thus he mistook the feigned cultivation of the supreme Way for the genuine and was perplexed in heart.

The sage’s approach to affairs is neither fixed nor unfixed; in matters of achievement, there is neither completion nor incompletion. Some expend little effort yet achieve much; others expend great effort yet achieve little. He never clings to one corner.

Zigong’s understanding of Confucius was merely of the Confucius who had donned the garb of the common world, and thus he marveled at the sight of one whose spirit was whole—the Dao of the sage. When governance reaches its utmost, it becomes one with Heaven. Thus, when he emerges, he walks alongside the people, and they do not know where he is bound. Vague and obscure in his nature, pure and complete in his conduct.

What the world calls merit, profit, and ingenuity all arise from human artifice—such a heart must surely forget these things. Zigong’s heart was not enlightened, and so he took the feigned Dao of the sage for the true.

The sage’s aspiration knows no bounds; the sage’s heart engages in non-action yet leaves nothing undone. Though he regards the world’s praise, he does not cling to it; though he receives the world’s censure, he does not reject it. To grasp what is meant is to grasp the intent of the words; to lose what is meant is to lose the intent of the words. Yet it is easier to disregard the world’s praise than to refuse its censure.

The Old Man of Hanyin did not pursue what his aspiration did not seek, nor did he act where his heart did not incline—thus he had yet to forget censure and praise, and so there were things he would not regard or accept. The nature of the sage, however, remains unharmed whether he follows the course of Heaven or dwells in seclusion; when he responds to things, he merely adapts to the moment.

As for those like this man, who are unaffected by the world’s censure or praise, one wonders what their hearts are truly like. Zigong had never heard the Master’s teachings on human nature and the Dao of Heaven, and so he took the Old Man for a man of perfect virtue while considering himself a man of the world’s tumult.

From the Master’s perspective, however, the Old Man still suffered from the flaw of clinging to one side. Hundun transcends form, qi, and the constraints of enumeration; "extension" is spoken in contrast to the Dao. To grasp one and discard two, to delight in the inner and forget the outer—these are not the complete Dao of the sage.

When clarity is manifest, its brightness is evident; when it enters plainness, it becomes unknowable. When non-action is manifest, it is evident; when non-action returns to simplicity, it becomes unknowable. To embody one’s nature is to unite with it; to embrace the spirit is to never depart from it. Thus, one may wander through the world, associating with others without losing one’s Heaven-endowed nature. Would you be truly astonished by this?

If you do not know and are not astonished, the distinction between genuine and feigned cultivation becomes clear.

**Detailed Annotation on the Dao:**
In the time of Hundun, people dwelled without knowing what they did, moved without knowing where they went, saw not with their eyes but with their spirit, heard not with their ears but with their qi—how then could ingenuity arise? The sage’s approach to the world is to embrace the One while encompassing the myriad, to wander within while responding without. What people do cannot be left undone; the tools that exist cannot be left unused. Thus, ingenuity lies in things, not in the heart; mechanical affairs lie in the moment, not in the device.

Serene and at ease, moving with the world, he knows not why things are as they are—even if Zigong were to revive Hundun in his time, could he defy Heaven and oppose men by refusing ingenuity? Ingenuity is employed merely to navigate change and prevent the people from growing weary.

Ingenuity arises from the mechanical heart, and the mechanical heart necessarily impairs purity and whiteness. This is to recognize one and ignore two, to cultivate the inner while neglecting the outer—such feigned cultivation of Hundun cannot escape the calamity of startling the world.

The perfected one’s virtue is not cultivated, yet things cannot depart from it. To cultivate the extension of Hundun is already a shallow virtue—how much more so for those who feign cultivation!

**Bi Xu’s Annotation:**
Zigong said of the gardener that he lived among the people, walking alongside them without their knowing where he went—was he truly different from the multitude? Merit, profit, and ingenuity surely did not enter this man’s heart. Unmoved by censure or praise, he was like Hundun. The man of the world’s tumult is easily swayed.

Hundun is natural; to cultivate it is not true, hence called "feigned." The "one" refers to essence, the "two" to function. Those who cultivate the heart depart from the world, while those who govern the external merge with the dust. To embrace one’s nature, hold fast to spirit, and wander through the mundane—this was the way of the ancients. Hundun has no apertures, so even spirits cannot fathom it—how much less can men?

Yongzhai says: "Mechanisms are tools; their use becomes scheming. What employs them is the heart. With a scheming heart, one cannot attain pure, empty clarity. Spirit arises unsettled and cannot embrace stillness or hold to unity, and thus cannot bear the Dao."

To emulate the sage is to admire the sage. *Yu yu* describes arrogance. "A lone string’s mournful song" speaks of one unknown to others, chanting to oneself—yet to compare this to striking a chime in Wei would be mistaken. To forget spirit and qi is akin to dismissing cleverness and insight; to cast aside the body is to forget the self. If you can do this, you may yet approach the Way. If not, you cannot even govern yourself—how then can you govern others?

*Beizou* means fleeting favor; *xuxu* describes self-doubt. Though one dwells in the world, acting as others do, one remains unaware of one’s own path—such a heart surely harbors no thoughts of merit, profit, or cunning. One who disregards praise will hardly heed slander. What is practiced in the world is called "attaining one’s purpose"; what is not practiced is called "losing one’s purpose."

"Wind and waves" speaks of being ensnared by worldly affairs and never at rest. *Jia* means great. *Hundun* refers to the primordial state of Heaven and Earth. To "know the One" is to hold fast to purity; to "not know the Two" is to keep the heart undivided. *Inner* is the heart; *outer* is the external world. Clarity allows entry into simplicity; non-action returns one to natural uncarvedness. *Embodying nature* is to preserve one’s true nature; *embracing spirit* is to become one with the spirit.

You have not yet grasped this Way—no wonder you are startled. To abandon toil for ease is human nature; fame, merit, and profit are also human desires. Yet in this world, some forsake the easiest path to follow the hardest, content with coarse fare and at peace in obscurity—how could mere wooden idols or earthen effigies attain such resolve? This only shows the depth of their devotion to the Way and the clarity of their self-knowledge. With firm and unshakable resolve, they overcome all obstacles; in time, they find peace, and peace leads to transformation.

Thus did the Old Man of Hanyin scorn cunning devices, content to carry his jar and till the fields, gazing at the clouds and skies. In the end, even the most persuasive words could not sway his heart or alter his conduct—were these not men like Chang Ju and Jie Ni of old? Though their lofty integrity may stem from innate purity, it is also the fruit of accumulated study and self-cultivation. What does it mean to "learn"? To emulate those who surpass you. What does it mean to "nurture"? To fill what lies within you.

His expression changed as he laughed—this laughter was surely his reply.

Zhun Mang was heading toward the Great Abyss when he encountered Yuan Feng on the shores of the Eastern Sea. Yuan Feng asked, "Where are you going?" He replied, "To the Great Abyss." "What will you do there?" "The Great Abyss is such a thing: pour into it, and it never fills; draw from it, and it never empties. I will wander there."

Yuan Feng said, "Do you have no concern for the horizontal-eyed people? I would hear of sagely governance."

Zhun Mang said, "Sagely governance? The sage enacts policies without error, promotes men without misjudgment, fully perceives the circumstances and acts accordingly. His words and deeds transform the world; with a wave of his hand or a glance, the people of the four directions all follow. This is what is called sagely governance."

"I would hear of the virtuous person."

"The virtuous person dwells without thought, moves without calculation, harbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness. All within the four seas rejoice in shared benefit, find peace in mutual provision. He is forlorn, like an infant who has lost its mother; bewildered, like a traveler who has lost his way. Wealth and resources abound, yet he knows not whence they come; food and drink suffice, yet he knows not their source. This is the bearing of the virtuous person."

"I would hear of the spirit person."

"The supreme spirit person rides the light, vanishing with form. This is called illuminating the vast. He fulfills his destiny and exhausts his nature; Heaven and Earth rejoice, and all affairs dissolve. The myriad things return to their true nature—this is called primordial chaos."

Guo’s commentary: "He acts as he wills, following the natural course. If he were to make things act for him, there would be no transformation."

He directs with a glance, and the people each attain their nature—this is because he allows them to act of their own accord. They share benefit and provision without any thought of self-interest. Virtue is the manifestation of the spirit person, hence it is called "bearing."

I would hear how one advances toward this.

The answer: To ride the light is to be without light, thus vanishing with form. Without self and allowing things to follow their course, empty and without attachment—this is not a forced union. When emotions are exhausted and destiny fulfilled, Heaven and Earth rejoice. Affairs do not obstruct joy—thus there are no affairs. When emotions return, primordial chaos knows no bounds.

Lü’s commentary: "Pour into it and it is never full; draw from it and it never depletes—this is the richness of Heaven’s treasury." Yuan Feng does not know its limitless supply yet meets the needs of the myriad things, thus appearing indifferent to the desires of the common people. Official appointments and promotions are never misplaced, so he is not indifferent to exalting worthies and employing the capable. Fully revealing the truth of affairs and acting as he wills, he does not compel others to conceal their nature and seek advancement. His words and deeds arise spontaneously, and the world transforms; with a wave of his hand or a glance, the people all come—thus he does not rely on rewards to encourage or punishments to deter. This is the sage’s manifestation in governance, yet not the means by which he embodies virtue.

The virtuous person thinks no thoughts, entertains no concerns, harbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness—his mind is ever empty. When the world rejoices in shared benefit and provision, all willingly submit without weariness. Like an infant who has lost its mother, he knows not where to turn. Like a traveler who has lost his way, he knows not where to go. With wealth and resources in abundance, he simply shares benefit with the world. With food and drink sufficient, he simply provides for the world. This is the bearing of the virtuous person, yet not the means by which he becomes spirit.

The vast expanse emits light to illuminate—this is the spirit’s way of riding it, not merely vanishing with light and form. Thus, though it illuminates, it remains boundless. To fulfill destiny is to shed the old and return to the constant. To exhaust emotions is to cast off falsity and dwell in truth. When all affairs dissolve, vacuity reaches its extreme; when the myriad things return to their emotions, they flourish and return to their roots. "Chaos" means merging into oneness; "obscurity" means even illumination is forgotten.

Yi Du’s commentary: "Water nearly attains the Dao—pour into it and it is never full, draw from it and it never depletes. Is this not the workings of the spirit?" Desiring to emerge and govern the people, one asks about sagely rule. When offices are mentioned, one knows promotions never fail their duties; when abilities are mentioned, one knows appointments never miss their mark. Fully revealing the truth of affairs, nothing is ever amiss. Words and deeds arise naturally, and the world transforms as one. With a wave of the hand or a glance, distant people all come—this speaks of the sage’s emergence to govern.

Without thoughts or concerns, forgetting beauty and ugliness, he is unburdened by things. The world’s joy in shared benefit is not self-provision. Like an infant who has lost its mother, he has nothing to rely on. Like a traveler who has lost his way, he has nowhere to go. With wealth, resources, food, and drink of unknown origin, he seeks nothing yet is self-sufficient.

The supreme spirit is spirit beyond spirit. Riding the light, he is above it and mounts it—form and shadow are unseen, returning to nothingness alone. To fulfill destiny is to arrive without striving. To exhaust emotions is to fully realize one’s nature. The spirit person has completed his destiny and fulfilled his nature; even Heaven and Earth rejoice—how much more so people, how much more so things! When the myriad things each return to the truth of their nature and destiny, they unite with the Dao—hence it is called "primordial chaos."

First, sagely rule is discussed as "fullness that radiates brilliance"—this is called greatness. Next, the virtuous person is "greatness that transforms"—this is called sageliness. Finally, the spirit person is "sageliness beyond knowing"—this is called spirit. Sagely rule speaks of his work; the virtuous person, his virtue; the spirit person, his Dao—yet in truth, all are the affairs of the sage.

Xiang Dao’s commentary: "In speech, he is earnest to respond to things; in the Dao, he is obscure to merge with them. Thus, outwardly he speaks of sagely rule, inwardly of virtue and spirit. Promotions never fail the capable, just as selecting the loyal and upright; with a wave or glance, the four directions all come—just as those who seek advancement gather. This is sagely rule, not governing by non-governance."

From "without thoughts or concerns" to "food and drink sufficient," the way to unite with the spirit is no more than this. Yet it is called the virtuous person because virtue is the essence of spirit, and spirit is the function of virtue. One who fully embodies essence has not yet attained the subtlety of function; one who attains the subtlety of function must return to essence. This is how the virtuous person and spirit person are distinguished.

Spirit corresponds to fire among the Five Phases—fire has no constant form, arising with things. When things exist, there is light; when things perish, it vanishes. The spirit’s utility enters and exits, and the people all employ it—riding the light to illuminate the vast is like this.

Bi Xu’s commentary: "The great ravine is the Eastern Sea. Pour into it and it is never full; draw from it and it never depletes—this illustrates the Dao’s inexhaustible source." Without fixed duties or abilities, not revealing his nature, acting without contrivance—this is the essence of governance. Words and deeds arise spontaneously, and the world transforms—this is the subtlety of sagely rule through non-governance.

Without thoughts or concerns, the mind functions like a mirror—thus the world willingly shares benefit and provision. Like an infant who has lost its mother, all it relies on is dear. Like a traveler who has lost his way, all directions are secure. Roaming the mind in tranquility, things abound and come of themselves. Merging qi in stillness, the belly is full and knowledge forgotten—this is the bearing of one who embodies virtue.

Riding the light of primordial qi, there is no light; if light is absent, how can form remain? This is called "illuminating the vast"—the Great Void is one body. Attaining Heaven’s mandate, the emotions of things are exhausted; inner joy forgets the outer. The myriad things return to their emotions, each to its root—this is called "primordial chaos." Stillness is called "returning to destiny."

Yongzhai observes: "To roam the great ravine" speaks of how the world is unworthy of contemplation—one must turn to observe the sea. When offices are bestowed appropriately and worthy individuals are promoted, one sees the substance in every matter that can be accomplished. Proceeding in accord with this, all actions and words become self-directed, not performed for others but for the self, and the world naturally transforms thereby.

When the sage raises a hand and points wherever he gazes, the people respond without fail—thus does he govern the world in stillness and motion. Stillness and motion arise without intention, hence he harbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness—this is what it means to think neither of good nor evil. The intent is to share provision and benefit, to rejoice with others as one.

Like an infant who has lost its mother, or a traveler who has strayed from the path, this speaks of finding joy in the human world while bearing an unavoidable sentiment. Wealth, resources, food, and drink are all set aside without concern—this expresses the absence of intention.

"Ascending spirit" describes how the spirit soars beyond heaven and earth. The light of sun and moon lies below, hence it is called "riding the light." With form extinguished, having a body is as if having none. "Illuminating the vast" means great clarity.

To reach the utmost of Heaven’s mandate is to exhaust the emotions within one’s nature, delighting in the Dao of heaven and earth so that no worldly affair burdens me. "Returning to emotion" is returning to true principle; returning to true principle, the myriad things and I become one. "Primordial chaos" is the meaning of *hundun*.

When one grows weary of the world’s narrowness and pettiness, one yearns for the great ravine’s inexhaustible flow—thus desiring to roam there.

Yuan Feng, suspecting the ruler had no concern for the people, inquired about sagely governance. The answer came: when offices are bestowed and promotions granted with perfect appropriateness, exhausting all talents, then those in office fulfill their duties, the overlooked are raised up, and all matters of governance fully reveal human sentiments and principles, allowing what ought to be done to proceed. For those who act and those who speak, all emerges from self-motivation, free from the flaw of affectation. With sincerity reaching things, how could the world fail to be transformed?

When a hand beckons or a glance directs, distant people all come—thus the near may be known. Such is the effect of the sage’s governance.

Next, he asked about the virtuous person. The answer came: dwelling without thought, moving without deliberation, their activity and stillness are without intention. Beauty and ugliness naturally dissolve. For all people under heaven who have not found their place, the virtuous person wishes to benefit, provide, and bring joy and peace. Thus, when cultivated throughout the world, their virtue is universal. Like an infant separated from its mother, wandering and losing its way, they regard the people with the compassion of one tending the wounded.

Wealth and resources are abundant, frugality ensures constant sufficiency. Food and drink are taken to fill the belly, nothing more. They do not know whence these come, for they never fix their mind on wealth or sustenance yet naturally supply their needs—this arises from their dedication to benefiting all under heaven. Such are the outward demeanors of the virtuous person, visible to the eye, yet not their true essence. As for their true essence, it admits no description.

Again, he asked about the spirit person. The answer came: ascending spirit, riding the light—this is what is meant by "proceeding above the great brightness." With form extinguished, having a body is as if having none—this is what is meant by "entering the gate of profound obscurity." This speaks of the spirit person’s movement between yang and yin, their transformations beyond measure.

"Ascending spirit" is the utmost of spirit. "Riding the light" means soaring through the void, treading upon radiance. Only through emptiness can light be emitted; only through vastness can illumination be contained. Only when one reaches the utmost of one’s mandate can one exhaust the world’s emotions, delight in the Dao of heaven and earth, and gauge it by the people’s hearts—thus the heavenly sight and heavenly hearing are no different.

All affairs dissolve, originating from my non-action, allowing the myriad things each to return to their original nature. This is called *hundun*. In *hundun*, I too am forgotten—how much more the things!

Discussing the spirit person and concluding with *hundun* further clarifies the source of their spirituality.

Menwugui and Chizhang Manji observed King Wu’s army. Chizhang Manji said, "Is it not inferior to the governance of Youyu?" Thus they avoided this calamity.

Menwugui said, "When all under heaven is equally governed, does Youyu govern it? Or does he govern it only after disorder?"

Chizhang Manji replied, "That all under heaven is equally governed is the wish—why calculate whether it is Youyu? Youyu’s treatment of sores is like applying a wig to the bald or seeking a physician for the sick. A filial son administering medicine to his compassionate father does so with a scorched countenance—this the sage finds shameful."

In the age of utmost virtue, worthies are not exalted, abilities are not employed. Superiors are like the tips of branches, the people like wild deer. Upright yet not knowing it as righteousness, loving one another yet not knowing it as benevolence, truthful yet not knowing it as loyalty, fitting yet not knowing it as trustworthiness, creatures moving and employing one another, not considering it a favor. Thus, actions leave no traces, affairs leave no legacy.

Guo’s commentary: Both sages governed only after disorder. Whether through yielding or military force, the difference lies merely in the times—there is no superiority between them. When governance is equal, desires are each satisfied—why calculate Youyu’s virtue and push him forward as ruler? Moreover, when all under heaven rests from wounds and chaos, they seek Youyu’s medicine. Administering medicine to tend a father, one’s countenance is scorched—governing all under heaven is not for glory.

In the age of utmost virtue, the worthy occupy their positions—not because they are exalted. The capable act on their own—not because they are employed. Superiors are like the tips of branches, rising above things yet not elevating themselves. Below, like wild deer, they are released and find contentment. Righteousness, benevolence, loyalty, and trustworthiness arise naturally from their nature, not from knowledge. Creatures employ one another, moving spontaneously. Thus, their actions require no gratitude to a master. Allowing things to act on their own, actions leave no traces. Affairs each remain within their bounds, so no teachings are transmitted to others.

Lü’s commentary: Youyu governed only after disorder, just as King Wu governed only after disorder. Who does not take all under heaven as their concern and yet falls short? Thus, Youyu’s treatment of sores is like applying a wig to the bald or seeking a physician for the sick—this is governing only after disorder. Administering medicine to tend a father, one’s countenance is scorched. The Dao does not reach the point of mutual forgetting, and the six relations lack harmony—this is what the sage finds shameful. Then how could Youyu’s governance be said to surpass King Wu’s?

Viewed from the perspective of progress, even Fuxi and Suiren cannot be called an age of utmost virtue. Viewed from the heart, the subtleties of Youyu and King Wu are precisely the age of utmost virtue. Through their non-action, they had no name. Without name, actions leave no traces, affairs leave no legacy. Who can compare or discuss between them?

Yi Duzhu’s commentary: Zhuangzi’s intent was to emulate the age of great antiquity, allowing people each to rest in the sentiments of their nature and fate. The way of Yao and Shun in governing all under heaven was but chaff and dregs, not what he valued.

When the people are in disorder, Youyu governs them with the seven virtues, like medicine treating sores. Wigs adorn the hairless, physicians attack illness—neither follows nature, just as governing follows disorder. Administering medicine to tend a father, one’s countenance is distressed. The world considers this filial, yet the sage finds it shameful. Speaking from the perspective of the heavenly Dao, this is to remedy the flaws of the human Dao.

In the age of utmost virtue, not exalting worthies means people do not contend for fame. Not employing abilities means people do not contend for skill.

The branch rises of itself without striving to be above, just as the wild deer dwells in the wild without striving to be there. Uprightness is the root of righteousness; mutual affection is the root of benevolence. Benevolence and righteousness are but names for uprightness and mutual affection. Sincerity is the root of loyalty; appropriateness is the root of trustworthiness. What the world calls sincerity and appropriateness merely seeks the reputation of loyalty and trustworthiness. Yet in the age of utmost virtue, benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trustworthiness are one with nature, never separated to pursue their names.

Living creatures move and employ one another, each following its nature, mutually serving without considering it a favor—it is simply so. To act without seeking advancement, to accomplish without seeking transmission, is to act without intent. The *Xiang Dao Zhu* notes: The harm of sores is not the same as the suffering of illness, and though the depth of suffering differs, their reliance on medicine is the same. The age of the Five Emperors was not the age of the Three Kings; though the world’s purity or turbidity differed, their reliance on governance was equal. From this perspective, can one deem Shun’s treatment of sores correct and King Wu’s treatment of illness wrong?

Zhuangzi regarded those who govern all under heaven as filial sons, and all under heaven as a compassionate father. Yin Wen considered himself a disciple and all under heaven his teacher. Those who take all under heaven to heart never fail to humble themselves to honor others, and thus earn the world’s affection and praise. Yet this differs from those who heedlessly lose their realm! The *Bixu Zhu* states: Dan Zhu was unworthy, so one of sagely brilliance replaced him; King Zhou of Yin was cruel and evil, so one who quelled disorder and chaos overthrew him. Neither was a state of tranquil, equal governance.

When the black-haired people were afflicted, Chonghua treated them with the medicine of benevolence and righteousness. To be ill and seek a physician, to be in disorder and seek governance—could this be what a good physician or filial son wishes to hear? Not exalting worthies means no contention; not employing abilities means no failure.

As above like the heartless tip of a branch, as below like a wild deer in carefree ease—this too is the principle of resonance and summoning. Where there is a domain, righteousness appears; where there is hatred, benevolence emerges; where there is deceit, loyalty becomes manifest; where there is falsehood, trustworthiness shines forth. Without the first four conditions, the latter four qualities would also vanish.

The mutual service of living creatures arises naturally, and none regard it as a gift. Without advancement, without transmission, none deem it extraordinary. *Yongzhai* states: "Man-Kai’s reliance on military force over yielding deference was condemned by *Wu Gui’s Inquiry*, and even the Yu dynasty was criticized for it. The world all desired governance, yet when the Yu dynasty governed, it was seen as a burden. Without sores, what need for medicine? Without baldness, what need for pine ointment? Without illness, what need for a physician? A filial son preparing medicine for his father wears a haggard look—how much better if the father were free of illness! A compassionate father and the shame of disgrace advance together, for the shame of disgrace follows later.

In an age of utmost virtue, all under heaven is pure and unified, and no names of worthies or abilities exist—thus, none are exalted, none employed. The tip of a branch and the wild deer are metaphors for being without emotion or desire. 'Uprightness' means cultivating the self. 'Mutual love' means mutual affection. 'Uprightness' and the four that follow were unknown—this means that in that time, there were no names for benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, or trustworthiness.

'Living creatures' refers to the people of simplicity, who serve and befriend one another without regarding it as a favor. 'Without advancement, without transmission' means that in that time, there were no matters of right and wrong, praise or blame. Only when the world is ungoverned does the name of governance arise; only when Yao’s son was unworthy did the abdication to Shun occur. For where yielding deference exists at the outset, military force must follow—just as sores precede medicine, baldness precedes hairpieces, and illness precedes physicians.

A filial son preparing medicine performs a duty, yet the sage feels shame for it, for nothing surpasses a father’s freedom from illness. How much more shameful is it to seek governance through military force? Thus, the age of utmost virtue is invoked to expose the shallowness of later customs, urging people to abandon the latter and embrace the former. Because none exalt worthies or employ abilities, they become like the tip of a branch, like the wild deer. The tip of a branch is the highest branch of a tree, lofty yet unaware of its elevation.

'Uprightness' likely means mutual correction, as can be inferred from the following text. These 'four unknowns' are what lead to convergence in the Dao, all transformed into a realm of mutual forgetting. Benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trustworthiness are merely distinctions made by the people of the world. 'Living creatures' refers to the simple folk who serve one another without regarding it as a gift, who befriend and assist without expectation of reward. 'Acting without advancement' is like a crow’s flight leaving no trace. 'Doing without transmission' means those passed by are transformed. This is the essence of an age of utmost virtue!"

*The Thirty-Eighth Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei *Concludes*
*The Thirty-Ninth Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei

The Daoist Priest Chu Boxiu of Wulin on "Heaven and Earth, Sixth"

A filial son does not flatter his parents; a loyal minister does not fawn upon his ruler—this is the height of ministerial and filial virtue. Yet when a parent’s words are affirmed and their conduct deemed good, the world calls such a child unworthy. When a ruler’s words are affirmed and their conduct deemed good, the world calls such a minister unworthy. But is this truly inevitable?

What the world calls "right" is affirmed as right; what it calls "good" is praised as good—yet such people are not deemed flatterers. Does this mean the world holds parents in stricter regard and rulers in greater reverence? To be called a "guide" to others provokes sudden anger; to be called a "flatterer" brings instant indignation. Yet all their lives, they guide others; all their lives, they flatter others—assembling crowds with polished words and elaborate metaphors, where beginning and end, root and branch, never align.

They drape themselves in robes, adorn themselves with colors, modulate their expressions to ingratiate themselves with the age, yet never admit to being flatterers. They mingle with the crowd, blending right and wrong, yet never consider themselves ordinary—this is the height of folly. Those who recognize their folly are not utterly foolish; those who recognize their delusion are not utterly deluded. The utterly deluded remain so all their lives; the utterly foolish remain so forever.

When three travel together and one is deluded, the destination may still be reached, for the deluded are few. But if two are deluded, the journey is laborious and the goal unattainable, for the deluded prevail. Now, with the whole world deluded, though I have aspirations, how can they be realized? Is this not lamentable?

Grand music does not reach the ears of the village; the tunes of *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* elicit only coarse laughter. Thus, lofty words do not resonate in the hearts of the multitude; profound truths remain unspoken, while vulgar speech prevails. With two heels dragging in delusion, the destination cannot be reached. Now, with the whole world deluded, though I have aspirations, how can they possibly be realized? To know it is unattainable yet still strive for it is but another delusion—better to let go and not impose.

Not imposing, who then shares the worry? A leper gives birth at midnight, hastily fetching a light to examine the child, anxious only that it might resemble him.

Guo’s commentary: When a ruler’s or parent’s words are affirmed and their conduct deemed good, this is merely defying convention to follow them—hence the world calls them unworthy, unaware of where true correctness lies. The world does not deem it flattery to defer to rulers and parents out of reverence, for reverence alone cannot command allegiance; true allegiance lies in following convention.

Thus, the sage never isolates himself from the world but moves with the times. In the age of emperors, he is an emperor; in the age of kings, he is a king—how could he defy convention to impose his own way? The world takes majority agreement as correctness, so to be called a "guide" or "flatterer" provokes anger. Yet all their lives, they guide and flatter, never seeking truth but only mutual approval.

Assembling crowds with polished words and elaborate metaphors should incur the charge of flattery, yet the world rewards such behavior, using it to gather followers. This is how those who follow convention escape blame. With the world so utterly foolish, one cannot but conform.

The Way of the sage is one, yet the paths of emperors and kings differ—truly, the world’s delusion is insoluble, so one must follow and yield to it. With the whole world deluded, though I long for the supreme Dao, it cannot be attained. Even Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu merely adapted to their times. Grand music is not prized in narrow alleys; vulgar folk delight in lewd tunes, joining in laughter. This is why the world never employs the sage but always relies on itself. Each clings to their own beliefs, unaware of their direction—nothing is better than aligning with them.

Seeking only what suits the moment, not forcing understanding, one may live without worry in this world. No one wishes to do evil; some are driven to it by harsh servitude, others lose their nature in confusion. Yet the confused may awaken, and the afflicted may seek goodness.

Lü’s commentary: When ministers and children affirm what their rulers and parents affirm and approve what they approve, the world calls them flatterers and deems them unworthy. But is it truly inevitable that affirming what is right and praising what is good is wrong? When they affirm what the world calls right and praise what it calls good, they are not deemed flatterers. Where, then, does the world’s strictness toward rulers and reverence for parents truly lie?

To be called a "guide" provokes anger, for the name is detested; yet all their lives, they guide others, assembling crowds with polished words and elaborate metaphors—beginning and end, root and branch, never aligning. Polished words and elaborate metaphors are not inherently reasonable, yet they are used to sway others, hence the charge of flattery. If even assembling crowds with such words is shameful, then those who, ignorant of the truth of life and destiny, drape themselves in robes, adorn themselves with colors, modulate their expressions to ingratiate themselves with the age, yet never admit to flattery—those who mingle with the crowd, blending right and wrong, yet never consider themselves ordinary—this is the height of folly.

Those who recognize their folly are not utterly foolish, for the ailing can name their illness, and the ill are not yet beyond help. But those who remain deluded and dull all their lives, unable to name their affliction, are beyond remedy. When three travel together and one is deluded, the destination may still be reached, like an age where the Dao flourishes and those who attain it are many while those who lose it are few. But if two are deluded, the journey is laborious and the goal unattainable, like an age where the Dao is lost and those who lose it are many while those who attain it are few. Now, with the whole world deluded, though I have aspirations, how can they be realized? The world’s Dao is utterly lost—no one remains to clarify this.

The people’s delusion has endured for so long that even if one clarifies their aspirations, none will follow—this is what the perfected ones deeply lament! Grand words do not penetrate the ears of the common folk; vulgar speech prevails. Even with Huizi’s wisdom, he still deemed Zhuangzi’s words useless—what then can be said of the world? If two of three travelers are deluded, the delusion of one alone may yet allow the destination to be reached, for a minor confusion merely misleads direction. But now, with the whole world deluded, this is no mere misdirection—it is a fundamental perversion of nature. Though I have aspirations, how can they be realized? I do not withhold the Dao out of selfishness, refusing to enlighten the world; to know it is impossible yet still force it is to add my own delusion to the rest. I am not one who exhausts his nature to the utmost while forgetting the world entirely. Thus, it is better to let go and not impose, to forget and be forgotten. If I do not impose, who then shares my sorrow?

Consider the leper who fears his child will resemble him—yet the Dao, as a thing, resides in the human heart, and if one alone cannot attain it, their affliction far surpasses leprosy! To align oneself with the vulgar and conform to a corrupt world is far worse than a child merely resembling his father. Though I let go and do not impose, will they not still suffer? Lin Yi’s annotation: The world calls a filial son one who obeys his parents’ wishes, and a loyal minister one who pleases his ruler. Yet if a parent’s actions are not wholly just and the child obeys without question, he falls into flattery; if a ruler’s deeds are not wholly just and the minister complies without restraint, he falls into sycophancy. True filial piety avoids flattery, true loyalty avoids sycophancy—this is the height of being a minister or child. If one serves ruler or parent by mere compliance, unable to measure their actions against the Dao and virtue, the world brands them unworthy—yet how can we be certain they truly are?

To follow ruler or parent while defying worldly norms is not necessarily right, but to defy ruler or parent while conforming to worldly norms is never called flattery. Does the world truly hold parents in greater reverence and rulers in higher esteem? Neither aligns with the ancient kings’ way of balancing both paths. *Dao* means guiding by their intent; *tan* means indulging their desires. The world condemns the name but not the deed, like one who hates drunkenness yet forces himself to drink. To speak in parables is skillful rhetoric; to adorn words is fine composition. What begins as right may end in wrong, what starts as good may end in corruption—this is the teaching of the village worthies, which the world readily follows. When corruption finally takes hold, no blame is assigned, which is why such behavior persists unchecked.

The world’s so-called gentlemen drape themselves in fine robes, adorn themselves with vibrant colors, and regulate their bearing with ritual—all to win the world’s affection. These are true flatterers who do not call themselves such, and those who associate with them mistake right for wrong yet do not consider themselves common—this is the height of folly. To be foolish yet recognize one’s folly is a lesser folly; to be deluded yet recognize one’s delusion is a lesser delusion. When three travel together and one is lost, the destination may still be reached, for the deluded are few. But if two are lost, the journey is laborious and the goal unattainable, for the deluded prevail. Now, with the whole world lost, Zhuangzi alone seeks the supreme Dao—how can it be attained?

Grand speech is bland and flavorless, like the *Xianchi* or *Dashao* melodies; the *Zheyang* and *Huanghua* are but vulgar ditties. Lofty words reach the highest clarity, ultimate words attain the Dao, yet ultimate words do not emerge because vulgar speech is abundant and prevails. A jar and a bell, both round and resonant when struck—if two jars and two bells are struck at once, the listener is left bewildered, with nowhere to turn. How much more so when the whole world is deluded? Though one may yearn for the Dao, who can be found to follow? To know the delusion cannot be dispelled yet still force its resolution is to add another delusion. Better to let go and not impose—if I do not impose, who then shares my sorrow?

Even the ugly long for their children to be beautiful—how then can the deluded not grow weary of their confusion and seek awakening? Detailed Annotation on the Dao: Where righteousness permits compliance, the filial son follows righteousness, not his father, as in the *Yi*’s *Gu* hexagram, line three: "Correcting the father’s corruption brings minor regret but no great misfortune." Thus, if a parent’s words or deeds are wrong, the world calls the obedient child unworthy. Where the Dao permits compliance, the loyal minister follows the Dao, not his ruler, as in the *Lin* hexagram, line two: "Approaching with sincerity brings good fortune and no misfortune." Thus, if a ruler’s words or deeds are wrong, the world calls the compliant minister unworthy. Yet when the world deems something right or good and approves it, it is never called flattery—does the world truly revere parents and honor rulers above all? It is because delusion is so pervasive that none can overturn it.

*Dao* indulges another’s faults; *tan* amplifies them. All people commit the deeds of flatterers yet despise the name—how could this be the only instance? They even resort to parables to clarify, adorned words to embellish, and gather crowds to propagate, ensuring that from beginning to end, root to branch, no one is held accountable for the faults they incur—truly, this is folly! If two are deluded, the journey is laborious and the goal unattainable, for they are lost on the path. If the sound of two jars and bells bewilders, the destination cannot be reached, for the confusion lies in intent. To govern the world by multiplying the few and reducing the many is easy; to govern by reducing the few and bewildering the many is difficult. When customs are shallow, vulgar songs and common speech easily lead astray, while grand words and lofty speech struggle to penetrate. Now, with the whole world deluded, though I have aspirations, how can they be realized?

Bi Xu’s Annotation: To follow worldly norms is to lose reverence for ruler and parent...

To follow ruler and parent is to gain the means to guide discourse among worldly customs. Yet ruler and parent represent the private goodness of one person, while worldly customs embody the public rightness of all under Heaven. Private devotion may lack loyalty and filial piety; public consensus may lack flattery and obsequiousness. Thus, the worthy and the noble have never stood entirely apart from their age.

Those who guide discourse fear being accused of impropriety, yet spend their lives doing so—merely seeking superficial agreement. They refine their words, gather crowds, and fill their doorways with shoes. The sage sees this and calls it guiding discourse, yet the world praises them. Who, then, is held accountable for their faults? They resent those who defy their will but accept those who comply with their smiles. Compared to those who don majestic caps and broad sashes, adorn their speech with ornate phrases, and revel in others’ praise—what difference is there? Those who can be enlightened are not deeply deluded; those with inner clarity are not utterly foolish. Those who remain unenlightened and dull-witted throughout their lives are merely ensnared by their craving for fame and profit.

If I were to explain their delusions with my own insights, I would be few against many—how could this not be lamentable? Grand words do not penetrate the ears of the common folk; lofty speech does not still the hearts of the masses. Like striking jars and bells, their sounds clash and diverge, not only failing to clarify but leaving no one knowing where to turn. Each person desires awakening, yet their confusion only deepens their confusion—who, then, shall share their sorrow?

The leper fears his child will resemble him, for he knows his own deformity. Yet do the deluded truly lack the heart to seek goodness? *Fuzhai* says: "Without flattery or obsequiousness, one can refine their ruler and parent. To agree with their every word and approve their every action without reproach is not true service." To a ruler or parent, remonstrance is right, and its absence is wrong. Yet if I, in dealing with the world, follow what it deems good and affirm what it deems right, does this not make worldly customs more revered than ruler and parent?

Now, what people call the *Dao* is merely what the world collectively approves—not something uniquely attained by the individual to walk alongside the Creator. If my *Dao* aligns with worldly customs, then my actions are nothing more than guiding discourse among them. I may despise the name of "guiding discourse," yet I cannot escape it my whole life—this shows I cannot differ from the world. Adorning my words and gathering scholars from all under Heaven to follow me, I may begin with ambitions loftier than my age, yet I cannot ultimately depart from the people of my time. Thus, my beginning and end, root and branch, fail to align.

The flowing robes, vibrant colors, and measured demeanor of the Confucians—these are but tools to ingratiate themselves with their age. All of this mocks the intentions of our sages. Those who study under me are but common and mediocre people; if my judgments align with theirs, then I, too, am but a common person. To associate with mediocrity yet not recognize oneself as mediocre—this is the height of folly and blindness. To remain unenlightened and dull-witted all one’s life is to lack self-awareness.

To analyze one’s direction is to consider one’s path. With the whole world deluded by its doctrines, though I alone have a direction, how can I turn back an entire age? *"Zhe Yang"* and *"Huang Hua"* are tunes of the streets and alleys, metaphors for vulgar speech. Grand sounds and ancient music represent the highest teachings. When vulgar speech prevails, the loftiest words are obscured.

To sit with feet dangling, refusing to move—this is the "two dangling feet" of confusion, as mentioned earlier. Some texts write "jars and bells," but this makes no sense; it is a copying error. To know something is unattainable yet force it is yet another delusion. If I do not press the matter, I need not concern myself with sorrow—this is self-consolation.

The leper fears his child will resemble him, for he knows his own deformity. Yet the deluded of the world lack such self-awareness, making them worse than the leper. At this point, the analogy seems to conclude yet does not—truly a remarkable stroke of the brush.

To approve the words and actions of ruler and parent is deemed unfilial by worldly standards. To approve the words and actions of worldly customs without being called flattering or obsequious shows that worldly customs are not more revered than ruler and parent. For ministers, loyalty is the essence of service; for children, filial piety is the essence of their duty. One should not serve ruler and parent with flattery. Yet in dealing with worldly customs, to affirm what it deems right and good without examining its substance is to do no more than guide discourse. To despise the name yet enact the reality, to follow it all one’s life without awakening, to adorn one’s words and gather crowds to boast—this ultimately harms the *Dao* and corrupts virtue, like the hypocrite who appears virtuous in the village. From beginning to end, root to branch, such inconsistency is truly perverse.

"Not holding each other accountable" means not reconciling with one another. They drape themselves in flowing robes, adorn themselves with vibrant colors, and modulate their demeanor to ingratiate themselves with the world, yet do not call themselves "guiding discourse"—what is this if not folly? Those who recognize their own folly and delusion are not truly foolish or deluded, for they may still be transformed. But those who remain unenlightened and dull-witted—even the sage can do nothing for them!

"If three walk together, it cannot be achieved"—this means the deluded of the world are many, and one person cannot turn them back. "Grand sounds do not enter the ears of the village; lofty words do not still the hearts of the masses"—this clarifies the earlier point. "Jars and bells" should be "dangling feet." Two people with dangling feet, confused and refusing to move, cannot reach their destination—how much less can one succeed when the whole world is deluded? Though I have aspirations, how can they be realized?

To know something is unattainable yet force it only deepens the confusion. Better to abandon it and not inquire—what sorrow remains then? These are the words of a true person seeing the hopelessness of salvation, sighing and consoling themselves.

The conclusion compares this to the leper who, when bearing a child or kindling a fire, fears his child will resemble him. Even the ugly do not wish their children to be like them—how much more must the deluded possess a heart that seeks goodness? If those in high positions can awaken them, their innate nature, which has never truly departed, will surely return.

The scripture states: "That which opens heaven gives birth to virtue; that which opens humanity gives birth to harm—how can one not be cautious?" A century-old tree, hewn into sacrificial vessels, adorned with blue and yellow patterns, is no different in its severed state from wood lying in a ditch. Compared to the ditch’s discarded fragment, the sacrificial vessel may seem fair or foul, yet their loss of original nature is the same. Robber Zhi and the virtuous Zeng and Shi may differ in conduct, but their loss of original nature is equal.

Moreover, the loss of original nature manifests in five ways:
First, the five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear;
Second, the five sounds disturb the ears, dulling their acuity;
Third, the five odors clog the nose, befuddling the senses;
Fourth, the five flavors muddy the palate, scarring the mouth;
Fifth, attachments and aversions agitate the mind, causing the nature to scatter and soar.
These five are all harms to life.

Yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di, priding themselves on their divergence, claim to have attained the Way—this is not what I call attainment. If confinement can be called attainment, then the turtledove in a cage may also be said to have attained it! When attachments, aversions, sounds, and colors pile up within, and when caps of skin and kingfisher feathers, sashes and long girdles bind without—when the inner self is crammed within barriers and the outer self is entangled in snares, one may strut within the coils of restraints, believing oneself to have attained the Way. But if this is so, then prisoners with bound arms and manacled fingers, or tigers and leopards trapped in sacks and cages, may also be said to have attained it!

Guo Xiang’s commentary omits discussion here. Lü Huiqing notes: "The sacrificial vessel, adorned with blue and yellow, is like the cultivation of Zeng and Shi; the discarded fragment in the ditch is like the defilement of the thief. To cultivate one’s nature is to return to virtue, and when virtue reaches its fullness, it becomes one with the primordial—this is true attainment. Why compare Zeng, Shi, or the thief in such terms?

For color itself is not clarity, yet one who sees color clearly is clear; when the five colors confuse the eyes, they render them unclear. Sound itself is not acuity, yet one who hears sound keenly is acute; when the five sounds disturb the ears, they dull their acuity. Understanding this, one sees that the five odors fumigate the nose, the five flavors sear the mouth, and attachments and aversions agitate the mind—all operate in the same way. When the mind is free of clinging, yet attachments and aversions unsettle it, the nature scatters and soars without cease.

Those like Yang and Mo were indeed talented scholars of the world, yet they never heard the Dao. Their knowledge did not extend beyond these five harms, and so they prided themselves on their divergence, claiming attainment—just as the turtledove in a cage may believe itself to have attained it! When the inner self is piled with barriers, preventing the Dao from gathering, and the outer self is bound by restraints, preventing the mind from unraveling its delusions—when the inner self is crammed within barriers and the outer self is entangled in snares, from the perspective of one who has attained true understanding, such a person is clearly trapped within coils. Yet if they still believe themselves to have attained the Way, then prisoners with bound arms and manacled fingers, or tigers and leopards in sacks and cages, may also be said to have attained it!"

The *Dubious Lone Annotation* states: The green-and-yellow sacrificial vessel is to the broken wood in the ditch as beauty is to ugliness—though they differ, their root is one, and both have lost their true nature. Robber Zhi, Zengzi, and Shishi differ in conduct and righteousness, yet all have strayed from the root and lost their nature, just as the sacrificial vessel is to the broken wood in the ditch. The five colors confuse the eyes; the five sounds confuse the ears; the nose is ensnared by scents, the mouth by flavors—all obstruct and congest, leading to discord, illness, and harm. Pursuing profit and shunning harm muddles the mind, and when the mind is muddled, the nature scatters. These five are all harms to life, yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di, straying beyond the bounds of nature and destiny, take this as attainment. Unable to avoid entanglement, they mistake entanglement for attainment—just as the turtledove in a cage may believe itself to have attained it! Pursuing and rejecting sounds and colors barricades the inner self; caps, sashes, and official robes constrain the outer. When the inner self is crammed within barriers like a stockade, and the outer self is bound by cords—when the inner is choked with pursuits and rejections, like a stockade, and the outer is fettered by sashes and robes, like snares—then to still believe oneself to have attained the Way is no different from prisoners with bound arms and manacled fingers, or tigers and leopards in sacks and cages, claiming to have attained it!

The *Detailed Dao Annotation* cites the *Laozi*: "The five colors blind the eyes; the five sounds deafen the ears; the five flavors dull the palate." For in the life of man, nature is tranquil and undisturbed, virtue is profound and unshaken. Yet when illusory realms appear before him, the wellspring of spirit becomes muddled, until he forgets his innate and priceless nobility, chasing instead the endless filth of desire—how could this not be delusion? This is why the noble person values frugality. Yet Guan Yiwu said: "When the ears desire to hear sounds but cannot listen, it is called *blocked hearing*; when the eyes desire to see beauty but cannot gaze, it is called *blocked sight*; when the body desires comfort but cannot attain it, it is called *blocked ease*; when the mind desires to act freely but cannot, it is called *blocked nature*. All these blockages are tyrants that oppress." To be bound by these oppressive tyrants, fretting endlessly for the sake of long life—this is not what I call nurturing. Why? For the one who nurtures well does not fret, and the one who frets does not nurture well.

The *Azure Void Annotation* states: A tree born whole and green, when carved into vessels, has its nature destroyed; man, born at ease, when practicing righteousness, has his truth marred. Thus, seeing, hearing, eating, and resting may be preserved or abandoned—both are acceptable. Only when one’s pursuits are untethered from the heart can one roam beyond the dust and grime, far from the reach of snares and cages. As *Yongzhai* said: The broken wood in the ditch, though carved into sacrificial vessels, remains but withered timber—though honor and disgrace differ, both are but dead wood. This aligns with Zang and Gu losing the sheep. Sounds, colors, scents, and flavors all suffice to disorder the nature; to speak of these four alongside pursuits and rejections is to restrain them. *Kun-gen* refers to congestion that rises from the nose to the forehead. *Zhuo-kou* means to defile the mouth (some write *du*, but this is incorrect). *Li-shuang* means to deviate and lose. When the mind is muddled by pursuing right and rejecting wrong, the natural nature is lost. The teachings of Yang and Mo are those that muddle the mind with such pursuits. They entangle themselves in their own doctrines yet believe they have attained the Way—just as the turtledove in a cage may believe itself to have attained it! This is the harshest rebuke. Their pursuits and rejections of right and wrong obstruct the breast, hence "barricading the inner self." Caps, sashes, and official robes are the attire of Confucians, binding them with ritual—hence "constraining the outer." Within, the limbs are choked and filled, like a stockade; without, they are bound by ritual, like a prisoner in fetters. *Yuan-yuan* describes the gaze. Others see them suffering as if in bonds, yet they believe themselves to have attained the Way—then prisoners and caged tigers may also be said to have attained it! This is the most vehement condemnation of Yang and Mo.

This passage uses analogies to clarify the harm of losing one’s nature. The various explanations have been detailed; no further gloss is needed here.

The opening of this chapter discusses the great transformations of Heaven and Earth and the multitude of beings. For one who rules all under Heaven, to broadly observe with the Dao and universally act with virtue, to be without action and without desire, with offices ordered and duties clear—this is to unify differences so that no being may diverge. Nothing is greater than Heaven and Earth; nothing is more revered than the Dao and virtue. The sage’s Dao encompasses both covering and supporting, hence they are paired in esteem. If one asks, "Were there a sage but no Heaven and Earth, how could he be a sage?" I would reply, "Were there Heaven and Earth but no sage, how could they be Heaven and Earth?" Thus, Heaven and Earth and the sage arise together and cannot be without one another. Therefore, the *Nanhua* uses Heaven and Earth to illustrate the ruler’s virtue—this is the Dao by which one governs Heaven and Earth, rules the myriad things, and reigns over all under Heaven.

People see the sage’s multifaceted responses and suspect his wisdom and clarity surpass others by far, yet they do not know this arises from governing the mind with non-action. Thus, one who possesses the virtue to rule all under Heaven establishes the root and rectifies what lies within. Then Heaven and Earth, without seeking to align, align; the myriad beings, without seeking to transform, transform. He sees what has no form, hears what has no sound—his profound resonance and wondrous responses extend beyond this. Hence, the Yellow Emperor lost the Dark Pearl, yet *Xiangwang* retrieved it; Emperor Yao sought *Nieque*, yet *Xu You* shunned him—this shows the Dao cannot be sought with intent, nor attained with wisdom and clarity. When the people of *Hua* offered three blessings to the sage—wealth, office, and immortality as a celestial immortal—what burden would he bear? When *Zigao* declined the lords and returned to plow, it revealed that as virtue declined and punishments arose, the worthy withdrew and hid. Laws grew dense in the past, calamities accumulated in the future—from this, disorder began.

Thus, contemplating the Supreme Beginning’s "being and non-being," one exhaustively investigates the root of things’ arising, the source whence nature and destiny emerge. When virtue aligns with the primordial, the myriad beings transform of themselves—whether affirmed or denied, so or not so.

Those who cultivate reverence and frugality, who exalt impartial loyalty, have already turned their minds outward. The man of Hanyin’s shame at employing machinery, King Wu’s leading of armies to deliver the people—one embraces simplicity and guards authenticity, the other wields expedience to uphold righteousness. Their withdrawal or advance, movement or stillness, differ with the times, yet neither strays from the Dao.

As for those who terrorize others as if harming themselves, the utterly deluded remain benighted all their lives. To carve raw simplicity into vessels, to muddy the mind and wound the nature—when virtue is insufficient to preserve life, what can be done for the world? All such acts mistake hardship for attainment, like the arduous labors of Yang Zhu and Mo Di.

To compare them to turtledoves and magpies, tigers and leopards, is not merely to belittle them—it is to detest them all the more! Of old, Mencius refuted Yang and Mo, and the sagely Dao shone forth; generations have extolled him, deeming his merit no less than Yu’s. Here, too, I say: the merit of the *Nanhua* is no less than Mencius’s. May later ages find this judgment sound.

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu, on the Primacy of the Heavenly Dao

The Heavenly Dao operates without accumulation, and so the myriad things are brought to completion. The Imperial Dao operates without accumulation, and so the world submits. The Sagely Dao operates without accumulation, and so all within the seas obeys. Those who comprehend Heaven, penetrate the sagely, and attain the sixfold penetration and fourfold openness of the imperial virtue—when they act for themselves, they remain obscurely quiescent in all things.

The stillness of the sage is not because stillness is good and thus he is still; rather, nothing in the myriad things can disturb his mind, and so he is still. When water is still, it clearly reflects the beard and brows; when level, it serves as the carpenter’s standard. If still water is so luminous, how much more so the spirit! The mind of the sage is still—it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the looking-glass of the myriad things.

Emptiness and stillness, tranquility and nonaction—these are the level of Heaven and Earth, the ultimate of the Dao and virtue. Thus do emperors and sages repose in them. In repose, there is emptiness; in emptiness, there is fullness; in fullness, there is order. In emptiness, there is stillness; in stillness, there is movement; in movement, there is attainment. In stillness, there is nonaction; in nonaction, those charged with affairs bear their responsibilities. In nonaction, there is ease. In ease, cares and troubles cannot abide, and longevity is prolonged.

Emptiness and stillness, tranquility and nonaction—these are the root of the myriad things. Illuminating this and facing south, one becomes a ruler like Yao; illuminating this and facing north, one becomes a minister like Shun. Practicing this in high position, one attains the virtue of emperors and Son of Heaven; practicing this in low position, one follows the Way of the mysterious sages and unadorned kings. Retiring with this and wandering in inquiry, scholars of rivers and seas, mountains and forests submit; advancing with this to govern the age, one’s achievements are great, one’s name illustrious, and the world is unified.

Guo Xiang’s Commentary:
The Heavenly Dao, the Imperial Dao, and the Sagely Dao—all three accord with the nature of things without entanglement. Thus, though they attain the sixfold penetration and fourfold openness, they do no harm to stillness. Goodness arises from stillness, yet there are times for movement. When nothing in the myriad things can disturb the mind, one attains self-realization. Possessing the means yet allowing things to act of themselves, what is reflected is utterly luminous. All that is uneven or incomplete arises from action. In repose, there has never been movement. *Lun* means principle. In movement, the attainer does not lose that by which he moves. In nonaction, the myriad beings are left to their own devices, each bearing its own responsibility. Thus, Shun and Yu possessed the world yet did not interfere. *Yuyu* describes a bearing of ease and self-contentment. Tracing the root of the myriad things, all arises from nonaction. One who possesses the Dao and is submitted to by the world yet holds no rank is what is meant by an unadorned king valuing himself. Advancing to govern the age is a lesser path. Thus, in retreat, one becomes a Chao or You; in advancement, an Yi or Lü. The substance of nonaction is vast—what is there it cannot accomplish?

When the sovereign does not take up the task of the chief minister, then Yi and Lü remain still in their offices; when the chief minister does not seize the duties of the hundred officials, then the hundred officials remain still in their governance; when the hundred officials do not meddle in the affairs of the myriad people, then the myriad people remain still in their occupations; when the myriad people do not alter their respective abilities, then the world remains still and self-content. From the Son of Heaven to the common people, the more nonaction, the more exalted!

Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:
The Heavenly Dao revolves endlessly yet never possesses anything, and so the myriad things are completed—not through carving or chiseling. The Imperial Dao attends to ten thousand concerns in a single day yet never possesses anything, and so the world submits—not through seeking favor. The Sagely Dao is present everywhere yet never possesses anything, and so the world obeys—not through force. Comprehending Heaven and penetrating the sagely, knowing that all operate without accumulation, one attains the sixfold penetration and fourfold openness of imperial virtue. In operation, there is endless transformation; without accumulation, nothing lingers in the breast. Even in acting for oneself, one remains obscurely quiescent in all things, for one acts yet has never acted. How much more so when each person acts for themselves—could there be anything not still?

The stillness of the sage is not because stillness is good and thus he is still. If one takes stillness as good and only then becomes still, this is not true stillness. When nothing in the myriad things can disturb the mind, one is inherently still—not still because one has made oneself still. Why? The myriad things are given life by me, yet I am not born—what in them can mirror me? Understanding this, in their flourishing, one observes their return; in their profusion, one sees their root. In returning and rooting, one is inherently still. If still water is so luminous, how much more so the spirit! The mind of the sage, embracing all from the highest to the lowest, is not merely still like water reflecting the beard and brows or leveling the carpenter’s standard. Here, Heaven and Earth observe their mirror; here, the myriad things take their form.

Emptiness admits no opposition; stillness is unified and unchanging; tranquility rests in unknowing; blandness does not contend with things; silence is motionless; vastness merges with the formless—these six are how the sage embodies nonaction. The level of Heaven and Earth admits no high or low. The ultimate of the Dao and virtue admits no addition. Here do emperors and sages repose. Responding to the myriad changes of affairs, supplying the myriad needs of beings, yet without this, there would be no repose, and the spirit would weary amidst the press of tasks. How can one be empty? In emptiness, the mind is stripped bare, and affairs are veiled—yet its richness extends to ten thousand differences. Thus, emptiness is fullness. Though different, their principle is never disordered. Emptiness is not merely fullness; it is also stillness giving rise to movement, movement yielding attainment.

Who can abide in stillness long enough that movement arises slowly? Then stillness gives rise to movement, and movement compelled by necessity yet fitting—this is movement yielding attainment. Attaining emptiness and arriving at stillness, the myriad things cannot mirror the heart, and nonaction prevails. In nonaction, those who bear tasks are held accountable, while I remain unwearied.

Serene and unperturbed, this holds true in all directions—where can care or rest find a place to lodge? Thus, years and longevity are prolonged. Understanding the discourse on emptiness and stillness, one sees that serenity and quiescence are but the same, differing only in how they are expressed.

The teeming ten thousand things all grow from nonaction—this is their root. The sages of antiquity: some faced south as Yao, some north as Shun; some dwelled above with the virtue of emperors and kings, some below with the Way of mysterious sages; some withdrew to seclusion or roamed in obscurity, some advanced to govern the age. Yet their illumination of the root of the myriad things was one and the same.

Lin Yi’s solitary note: The Dao is all-pervading—thus in Heaven it is the Heavenly Dao, in emperors the Imperial Dao, in sages the Sagely Dao. Heaven moves by the Dao: cold and heat alternate, sun and moon succeed one another, never accumulating—thus the myriad things are all brought to completion by it. The movement of the Imperial Dao and Sagely Dao is likewise.

The emperor is the emergence of the spirit; the sage, the entry of the king. "Emperor" and "king" speak of their positions; "spirit" and "sage" speak of their Ways. Illumined by Heaven, they act without acting; penetrating the Dao, fortune and misfortune share the breath of the people. Acting without acting, their transformation pervades the six directions; sharing the people’s cares, their virtue accords with the four seasons.

Thus, the emperors and kings of old, though their reach spanned the six directions and their influence opened the four quarters, in their virtue simply entrusted things to their own course. Their minds were obscure yet utterly still—this stillness of the sage is not the stillness set against movement, nor the stillness of which the world speaks.

Goodness is what is called nature. From the perspective of its continuity with the Dao, it is goodness; from the perspective of its completion, it is nature. Nature is the mandate within me, never not still—yet why do people fail to attain this? Because their minds chase after things, and so they lose it. Only the sage, not allowing things to disturb the mind, can attain stillness.

The mind is like a ruler; nature is like a state. When the ruler is upright, the state is well-governed; when not, the state falls into chaos—this is the natural order. To fully realize one’s nature, one must first still the mind. When water is still, it is clear and level—this is what the great craftsman takes as his model. If still water can achieve this, how much more the human mind?

The mind is the dwelling of spirit. When stilled, essence unifies and spirit is whole; when disturbed, essence is exhausted and spirit wearies. With essence unified and spirit whole, the mind is round and luminous, illuminating all—this is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the mirror of the myriad things.

The mind is empty, then still; still, then at peace; at peace, then able to attain nonaction. Nonaction is the level of Heaven and Earth, the ultimate of the Dao and virtue, the repose of emperors, kings, and sages. Only in nonaction can one meet the Dao in emptiness.

Emptiness then fullness—this is the natural principle of the myriad things, nowhere absent. Their action arises from nonaction, and thus what was once full becomes empty! Emptied and stilled, stillness then gives rise to movement—this is how movement is not lost. Not losing movement, one attains nonaction. In nonaction, each talent is entrusted with its task, each responsibility fulfilled, allowing them to exhaust the utmost of their nature and allotted roles.

Serene and self-content, the mind merges with the ultimate principle, forgetting the distinction between self and things. Care and misfortune cannot lodge within; life and death are not clung to. Returning to the root and recovering the mandate, one becomes one with the workings of creation—this is the root of the myriad things.

Illumined by this, whether facing south or north—like Mencius desiring to be a ruler and fulfill the ruler’s Way, or a minister and fulfill the minister’s Way—both take Yao and Shun as their model. The mysterious sage, like Yu or Shun, rises from obscurity with profound virtue; the uncrowned king, like Confucius, though without position, is revered.

Withdrawing to seclusion or roaming in obscurity—like Chao Fu and Xu You; leaving traces to govern the age—like Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou. Though the traces of the sages vary with the times and respond to change, their Way is one.

Chen Xiangdao’s note: The Heavenly Dao moves without accumulation, yet the myriad things are completed; the Imperial Dao moves without accumulation, yet the world returns to it; the Sagely Dao moves without accumulation, yet the world submits. Thus, the sage’s relation to the world: when flourishing, he embodies the virtue of emperors and kings; when in obscurity, the Way of the mysterious sage.

The *Book of Documents* praises Yao for broadly enacting imperial virtue and ultimately becoming lord of the world—this is the Imperial Dao moving and the world returning to it. Mencius says Confucius, though he traveled east, west, south, and north, had no thought that was not obeyed—this is the Sagely Dao moving and the world submitting.

Emptiness and stillness, serenity and quiescence—this is the mind’s stillness and the qi’s indifference. Nonaction is the spirit. To attain emptiness and guard stillness, to make the mind serene and the qi indifferent, and to arrive at nonaction—this is how one becomes the level of Heaven and Earth, the ultimate of the Dao and virtue, the repose of emperors, kings, and sages. Repose is the place where they lodge.

The profound is the root of the wondrous; the plain is the substance of nature. The mysterious sage and uncrowned king are the same as the "profound virtue" spoken of in the *Book of Documents*; the emperor, king, and Son of Heaven are the same as its "enacting virtue."

Chen Bixu’s note: To embody without speaking is to be illumined by Heaven; to adapt to the transformations of things is to penetrate the sagely. Entrusting things to their growth and movement is to act naturally; obscure and unknowing is to attain utter stillness. The stillness of the sage responds to things without being swayed—it is not the stillness of quiescent extinction.

When one follows things with serene composure and thereby achieves, it is not that stillness is inherently good—rather, stillness arises because nothing can disturb the heart. When water is still, even a hair’s shadow cannot hide; when the heart is still, being and non-being are clearly reflected. Thus, emptiness and stillness allow auspiciousness to settle and the wondrous Dao to arise; tranquility and simplicity let spirit and qi flourish while pristine clarity gathers. Stillness and silence widen the numinous chamber and pacify the true sovereign; non-action preserves harmony and principle in full, perpetuating nature and life. This is no extraordinary feat—it is the ordinary state of Heaven and Earth, the ultimate correctness of the myriad things, the resting place of sages.

When the heart rests, affairs become empty. When affairs are empty, principle abounds. When principle abounds, nature becomes still. When nature is still, movement is no longer reckless. Through non-action, responsibility does not lie with oneself; when responsibility does not lie with oneself, joy increases and sorrow vanishes, and one’s years are long. Those who understand this recognize that the eight qualities—emptiness, stillness, and the rest—are the subtle functions of the Dao, the affairs of non-action.

In high position, one becomes an enlightened ruler; in low position, one becomes the teacher of emperors.

The Grand Scribe of Zhou and the Minister of Justice of Lu exemplify this. In reclusion and wandering, Boyi and Shuqi embody it. In manifesting governance to pacify the world, Shuo of Zhuan and Lü Wang demonstrate it. When ruler and minister each hold their proper positions without overstepping, the world is well-ordered.

Lin’s *Yongzhai Oral Exegesis* states: "The Way of the Thearch and the Way of the Sage are fundamentally difficult to distinguish. The classics further identify the Thearch with the Three Sovereigns and the Sage with the Five Emperors." Moving without accumulation—this is purity in ceaseless motion. The central meaning of this passage lies in the character "stillness." Within supreme stillness, movement occurs without accumulation—how could this resemble withered wood or dead ashes? "Six penetrations and four openings" signifies unimpeded freedom in all directions, above and below.

The stillness of the sage is not stillness for its own sake but stillness because it is good. This line is most vital: when the myriad things cannot disturb the heart, stillness is not sought but arises naturally. The analogy of water and mirror to stillness is profoundly apt. The eight characters—emptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, silence, solitude, non-action—unfold the meaning of stillness. This is the immutable principle of Heaven and Earth, the ultimate affair of the Dao and virtue, the resting place of the hearts of thearchs, sages, emperors, and kings.

To rest is to be empty—precisely as the Dao gathers in emptiness. To be empty is to be full—just as the Chan school says, "True emptiness gives rise to real existence." Within the fullness of principle, inherent order naturally emerges, like clarity within undifferentiated wholeness. Emptiness gives rise to stillness; stillness gives rise to movement—this is the mutual rooting of movement and stillness. Movement without misstep is called "attainment." Each fulfills its affairs and bears its responsibilities—this is non-action that accomplishes all.

Anxiety and weariness cannot take hold, for "taking hold" is like entering—this is the meaning of "the humane are without anxiety." Long life is the meaning of "the humane are long-lived." Again, the eight characters are invoked, concluding with the root of the myriad things, for this principle emerges from their very beginning. The remainder of the commentary largely accords with the previous explication.

Chu’s *Personal Insights* states: "To speak of Heaven is to include Earth; to speak of the sage is to include humanity; the Thearch encompasses the Three Powers and enacts transformation." Thus, with six penetrations and four openings, virtue operates within, enabling governance of people and transformation of things. Above, one becomes a sovereign; below, a king. In self-cultivation, one turns inward to order the self, returning to the source. The luminous Dao appears dim, yet nothing remains unstilled.

For ordinary people, stillness must be cultivated before it is attained, and only then can they sing its praises. How could the stillness of the sage be stillness pursued as a virtue? Nothing can disturb the heart—this is the reason. It is inherently still, not made so. When water is still, it is clear and level; the great craftsman takes this as a model. It is naturally clear and level, capable of reflection and measurement—an analogy for the human spirit, which, when supremely still, becomes luminous. Nothing in Heaven and Earth escapes its mirroring; what greater nobility could the self possess? Yet the deluded toil without knowing when to stop, exhaust themselves without knowing rest, gradually depleting themselves beyond remedy—how can this not be lamentable?

The way to nourish the spirit does not extend beyond emptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, silence, solitude, and non-action. How could the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth or the ultimate of the Dao and virtue lie beyond these? Thus, the principles of things find their precise accord here; the sage finds rest here. Though the myriad threads of existence clamor, they do not stir the heart. Yet within this seeming vagueness, the supreme principle abides. Things do not remain forever still—movement arises from this.

When those who bear affairs take responsibility, I practice non-action. Anxiety and misfortune depart, and years are long—this is grasping the root and holding fast to it. In this way, whether as ruler or minister, one accords with the Dao. In advancement or retreat, all is fitting.

Here the sagely Way models itself on Heaven, achieving the effect of movement without accumulation.

The *Nanhua zhenjing yihai zuanwei*, Scroll Forty, concludes.

**Scroll Forty-One**
**The Way of Heaven, Second Chapter**

Stillness makes one sagely; movement makes one kingly. Non-action brings honor; unadorned simplicity ensures none in the world can rival its beauty.

One who clearly comprehends the virtue of Heaven and Earth—this is called the great root and great origin, one who harmonizes with Heaven. Through this, one harmonizes and regulates the world, harmonizing with others. Harmonizing with others is called human joy; harmonizing with Heaven is called Heavenly joy.

Zhuangzi said: "O my master! O my master! You order the myriad things without cruelty, bestow blessings upon ten thousand generations without benevolence, outlast high antiquity without longevity, cover and bear Heaven and Earth, carve and shape all forms without artifice—this is called Heavenly joy."

Thus it is said: One who knows Heavenly joy—while living, moves with the course of Heaven; in death, transforms with things. In stillness, shares virtue with yin; in movement, flows with the waves of yang. Therefore, one who knows Heavenly joy bears no resentment from Heaven, no blame from others, no burden from things, no reproach from spirits.

Thus it is said: In movement, one is Heaven; in stillness, one is Earth. With a single mind settled, one rules the world. No spirits bring misfortune; no soul grows weary. With a single mind settled, the myriad things submit.

This means: by extending emptiness and stillness to Heaven and Earth, and penetrating the myriad things, one attains Heavenly joy. Heavenly joy is the heart of the sage, through which the world is nurtured.

Guo’s commentary: "Act when it is time to act; cease when it is time to cease—naturally revered by things."

Thus, only unadorned simplicity can match the beauty of Heaven. Heaven and Earth take non-action as their virtue. When their root and origin are made clear, one does not oppose Heaven and Earth. Following Heaven is how one responds to others; when Heavenly harmony is perfect, human harmony is complete. When Heavenly joy is attained, human joy is fulfilled.

Things change and intermingle, calling it "barbarism"—but this is merely "barbarism," not the Five. The Master’s violence... The Seven refers to the name of universal love; without love, there is nothing to call "Seven." Longevity means "duration is distant"; without duration, there is nothing to call "longevity." Skill means "subtlety in making"; all is self-so, so there is nothing to call "skill." This is called Heavenly joy—joy without intent, and joy is fulfilled.

Thus, in stillness, one shares virtue with yin; in movement, flows with the waves of yang. Though movement and stillness differ, the absence of intent unifies them. Always without intent, one rules the world without trace or affliction. My heart is still, and the hearts of the myriad things communicate. When communication occurs, they submit; when it does not, they rebel. How does the sage nurture the world? Through nothing but Heavenly joy!

Lü’s commentary: "Stillness makes one sagely—this speaks from within. Movement makes one kingly—this speaks from without. Non-action brings honor, so in serving the world, one need not rely on talent or wisdom. Unadorned simplicity ensures none can rival its beauty, so in governing the world, one need not rely on ornamentation. All is simply a matter of clearly comprehending the virtue of Heaven and Earth. Thus, whether in high or low position, in action or leisure, though circumstances differ, the great root and great origin remain unchanged. When one penetrates this, non-action harmonizes with Heaven. In regulating the world, one harmonizes with others. Harmonizing with Heaven is called Heavenly joy; harmonizing with others is called human joy—nothing more than learning from this alone."

Ordering things without cruelty, bestowing blessings without benevolence, shaping all forms without artifice—this is what Zhuangzi took as his master. Following the inherent inclinations of the heart, who lacks a master? Thus, this joy does not come from without—hence it is called Heavenly joy.

One who knows Heavenly joy—while living, moves with the course of Heaven, yet I have never been born; in death, transforms with things, yet I have never died. In stillness, shares virtue with yin, yet does not know it as stillness; in movement, flows with the waves of yang, yet does not know it as movement. No resentment from Heaven, no blame from others—because I have never been in their realm. No burden from things, no reproach from spirits—because I have never been in my own.

In movement, one is Heaven; in stillness, one is Earth. The reason lies solely in a settled mind. Thus, in ruling the world, externally no spirits bring misfortune, internally no soul grows weary—how could the myriad things not submit? The mind is settled because it is never not empty, never not still. I can extend emptiness and stillness to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things—this is how Heavenly joy is attained, the heart of the sage through which the world is nurtured.

Yi Du’s commentary: "The preceding discussion addressed the different paths of sages and worthies in advancement and withdrawal. Here it is said: in stillness, all can become sagely; in movement, all can become kingly. In lowly positions, one is an uncrowned king; in leisure, one is... submission. Non-action brings honor—this is what is called true honor. The sage’s heart never treats the world’s vessels as vessels, but embraces its own simplicity; never regards the world’s colors as colors, but sees its own plainness. If so, none in the world can rival its beauty. This is how one’s office is entrusted to the inner workings of nature and destiny, and the virtue of Heaven and Earth is made clear. The great root and great origin refer to destiny and nature. Only by following nature and destiny, harmonizing with Heaven, can one regulate the world and harmonize with others. How could Heaven and humanity overcome one another? Thus, each attains its joy. Though joyful, one does not know why one is joyful—it is simply fitting with one’s nature. In life, one moves with the course of Heaven—coming as it should, timely. In death, one transforms with things—departing as it should, compliant."

That which neither arises nor transforms—is this not the joy of Heaven? In motion and stillness, each attains its proper measure; released, there is no resentment from Heaven nor blame from others, no encumbrance from things nor reproach from spirits. The Dao now abides in Heaven, thus its movement is celestial. Virtue extends to the hidden, thus its stillness is earthly. Unburdened by things, the mind settles into oneness; emerging to govern the world, the myriad beings each rectify their nature and destiny. Spirits do not haunt, so there is no premature harm; the hun-soul does not weary, so the spirit congeals and nature is restored.

When thus the mind is settled within, the myriad things submit without; emptied of knowledge, stilled in heart, one extends the great root of Heaven and Earth and penetrates the ultimate principle of the myriad things—this is again what is called the joy of Heaven, where there is nowhere one goes that is not fitting. The heart of the sage, by which he nurtures the world, lies in this.

*Detailed Annotation on the Dao* states: Stillness that is sagely and movement that is kingly—this is the emergence of brightness. Movement that is kingly and stillness that is sagely—this is the descent of the numinous. The uncarved block is the root of vessels. When vessels are used in the world, some are employed, some set aside; yet the uncarved does not strive to be used, nor is its setting aside ever dishonored. Plainness is the root of colors. When colors appear in the world, some are deemed beautiful, some ugly; yet plainness does not strive for beauty or ugliness and remains ever esteemed. Thus, the uncarved and plain cannot be rivaled in beauty. When governance is harmonious, people are harmonious; when people are harmonious, Heaven and Earth are harmonious; when Heaven and Earth are harmonious, the myriad things flourish; when the myriad things flourish, spirits and ghosts are at peace; when spirits and ghosts are at peace, the hidden finds its place, and the luminous does not become baleful. Thus, people ascribe virtue to ghosts, and ghosts ascribe virtue to people—so the world is made clear.

As *Laozi* says: "Governing the world with the Dao, its ghosts do not act as spirits."
As *Liezi* says: "Things have no blight, ghosts no numinous echoes." Such is the case.

*Bixu’s Annotation* states: Stillness that is sagely and movement that is kingly both honor non-action and esteem the uncarved and plain. Qian and Kun take simplicity as their virtue. Simplicity is the ancestral root of the myriad things. When the ancestral root is not lost, human affairs are harmonious; when human affairs are harmonious, the principles of Heaven flow smoothly, and yin spreads unimpeded.

To carve oneself is not righteousness; to glorify oneself is not benevolence; to seek longevity for oneself is not true longevity; to transform oneself is not skill. Unenslaved by other things, this is called the joy of Heaven. When each thing delights and harmonizes itself, then movement is not movement, and stillness is not stillness. The settled mind cannot be shifted by creation and transformation, nor altered by yin and yang—it is non-dual with the Great Void. The heart of the sage, by which he nurtures the world, is nothing other than the Supreme Harmony.

*Fuzhai* states: Stillness that is sagely and movement that is kingly—these are the four words "inner sageliness, outer kingliness." The Dao is uncarved and plain, without ornament, yet the world’s beauty cannot surpass this. If one clearly understands this virtue of Heaven and Earth, one may become Heaven’s companion.

Harmony means union. The great root and great origin praise the virtue of nature, akin to the meaning of "self-rooted" and "self-originating." When the world is harmonized and regulated, one unites with others—just as Yao said, "You are Heaven’s union," and "I am humanity’s union." The lines "My teacher! Ah, how utterly free from artifice!" first appear in the *Great Master* chapter, attributed to Xu You, but here, with "Zhuangzi says" prefixed, it is clearly a parable and should not be taken as literal speech.

"Heavenly movement" means moving in accord with Heaven’s natural principle; "transformation of things" means changing with things. Stillness is yin; movement is yang. "Flow" means to follow. The Confucian school only says, "Do not resent Heaven, do not blame others," but here two more lines are added—"no encumbrance from things, no reproach from spirits"—rendering it even more spirited.

"Spirits" manifest as hauntings; the hun-soul wearies as fatigue. "Spirits" and "hun-soul" refer to the essence and spirit. When the mind is settled, the essence and spirit naturally settle, and the myriad things submit of themselves. Applying the principle of emptiness and stillness among Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things—this is called the joy of Heaven. "Nurturing the world" means to govern the world by well-nurturing its people.

The Dao within humans: in stillness, it is sagely; in movement, it is kingly—both honor non-action and esteem the uncarved and plain. This is like the virtue of Heaven and Earth, which never acts, never adorns, yet yin and yang, the four seasons, the sun, moon, mountains, and rivers—all act, all are adorned. Understanding this principle, the great root and great origin of the world are established.

The so-called root and origin are the Dao of inner sageliness and outer kingliness, uniting with Heaven. Used to harmonize and regulate the world, it unites with others. Human joy and Heavenly joy both arise from harmony; though their names differ, the source of joy is one. Like the distinction between inner and outer in sageliness and kingship, the Dao itself is not divided.

Harming things is not malevolence; benefiting the world is not the seventh virtue—one forgets good and evil. As for forgetting longevity and forgetting skill, one is not bound by time nor enslaved by ability or inability. What the *Nanhua* takes as its teacher is nothing other than this.

Life is Heavenly movement, natural motion; death is the transformation of things, movement that must have an end. Thus, movement and stillness accord with the Dao of Heaven. "No resentment from Heaven nor blame from others, no encumbrance from things nor reproach from spirits"—this further clarifies the source of joy. "Its movement is Heavenly, its stillness earthly"—this is the meaning of "shared virtue" and "shared flow." With a mind settled and non-active, the world turns toward it.

No reproach from spirits, so ghosts do not haunt. No encumbrance from things, so the hun-soul does not weary. Acting without shame before the hidden and manifest, why would things not submit? This is nothing other than extending the principle of utmost emptiness and profound stillness to Heaven and Earth and penetrating the myriad things. How could the heart of the sage, by which he nurtures the world, lie beyond this?

The virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and Earth as its root, the Dao and virtue as its master, and non-action as its constant. In non-action, one employs the world with abundance.

When acting, one is used by the world and finds insufficiency. Thus the ancients prized non-action. When the ruler practices non-action, the subjects also practice non-action—this means the subjects share the same virtue as the ruler, and when they share the same virtue, they do not serve as subjects. When the subjects act, the ruler also acts—this means the ruler shares the same path as the subjects, and when they share the same path, there is no true lord. The ruler must practice non-action to employ the world, while the subjects must act to be used by the world—this is an unchanging Dao.

Thus, the ancient kings who ruled all under Heaven, though their knowledge encompassed Heaven and Earth, did not rely on their own deliberation; though their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not delight in their own words; though their abilities exhausted all within the seas, they did not act on their own. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured; the emperor and king practice non-action, yet the world achieves success. Thus, nothing is more spirit-like than Heaven, nothing more abundant than Earth, nothing greater than the emperor and king. Therefore, it is said: the virtue of emperors and kings matches Heaven and Earth. This is the Dao of riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the people as one would employ grass.

The root lies with the ruler, the branches with the subjects; the essential lies with the lord, the details with the ministers. The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the least of virtues; rewards and punishments, benefits and harms, the application of the five punishments—these are the least of teachings; rituals, laws, measures, and standards, the comparison and scrutiny of names—these are the least of governance; the sounds of bells and drums, the adornments of feathers and banners—these are the least of music; weeping and mourning garments, the gradations of funeral attire—these are the least of grief. These five least things require the operation of spirit and the movement of the mind’s techniques before they can be followed.

The lesser arts were practiced by the ancients, but they were not what they prioritized. The lord leads and the minister follows; the father leads and the son follows; the elder brother leads and the younger brother follows; the elder leads and the younger follows; the man leads and the woman follows. This hierarchy of honor and precedence is the course of Heaven and Earth, and thus the sages took it as their model. Heaven is honored, Earth is lowly—this is the position of spirit and illumination; spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—this is the sequence of the four seasons. The myriad things transform and take shape, their flourishing and decline follow the flow of change. If even Heaven and Earth, most spirit-like, have a sequence of honor and precedence, how much more so does the human Dao!

In ancestral temples, kinship is honored; in court, respect is honored; in villages, seniority is honored; in conduct, worthiness is honored—this is the sequence of the great Dao. To speak of the Dao while violating its sequence is not the Dao; to speak of the Dao while not following the Dao—how can one grasp the Dao? Thus, the ancients who illuminated the great Dao first illuminated Heaven, then followed with virtue and power; once virtue and power were clear, they followed with benevolence and righteousness; once benevolence and righteousness were clear, they followed with the division of duties; once the division of duties was clear, they followed with forms and names; once forms and names were clear, they followed with the delegation of tasks; once the delegation of tasks was clear, they followed with investigation and reflection; once investigation and reflection were clear, they followed with right and wrong; once right and wrong were clear, they followed with rewards and punishments.

Once rewards and punishments were clear, the foolish and the wise found their proper places, the noble and the base assumed their ranks, and the worthy and the unworthy followed their natures. Abilities were distinguished, and names were adhered to. By this, one served superiors, nurtured subordinates, governed things, and cultivated the self. Without employing cunning schemes, one necessarily returned to the natural. This is called Great Peace, the ultimate of governance.

Thus, the *Book* says: "There are forms and names." Forms and names existed among the ancients, but they were not what they prioritized. Those who spoke of the great Dao underwent five transformations before forms and names could be raised, and nine transformations before rewards and punishments could be discussed. To abruptly speak of forms and names is to not know their root; to abruptly speak of rewards and punishments is to not know their beginning. To speak in reverse of the Dao and encounter the Dao while expounding—this is what people govern, how can they govern others? To abruptly speak of forms and names and rewards and punishments is to possess the tools of governance but not the Dao of governance. These can be used for the world but are insufficient to employ the world. This is called a disputatious scholar, a one-sided person.

Rituals, laws, measures, and standards, the comparison and scrutiny of names—these existed among the ancients. They are how inferiors serve superiors, not how superiors nurture inferiors.

**Guo’s Commentary:** "To employ the world with abundance" means to have leisure. If one is hurriedly seeking to be used by things, one may gain subjects, but when they become subjects, there is no surplus. The craftsman does not act in carving wood but acts in using the axe; the ruler does not act in handling affairs directly but acts in employing ministers. Ministers can handle affairs directly, and the ruler can employ ministers; the axe can carve wood, and the craftsman can use the axe. Each fulfills their ability—this is not acting. If the lord takes over the minister’s duties, he is no longer a lord; if the minister seizes the lord’s authority, he is no longer a minister. Each attends to their own tasks, and superiors and inferiors both attain their proper places—thus the principle of non-action reaches its perfection.

Those who employ the world also act, but they attain this acting by following their nature and moving spontaneously—thus it is called non-action. Those who are used by the world also act, but those below handle affairs directly—thus even Yao and Yu, when serving as ministers, were still called "acting." In the relationship between superior and inferior, the lord is still and the minister is active; comparing past and present, Yao and Shun practiced non-action while Tang and Wu acted. Each followed their nature, and the mechanisms of Heaven mutually arose—thus, in past and present, in superior and inferior, who does not practice non-action, and who acts? The one above rests in the inability to practice non-action and instead takes over the duties of ministers. If Gaoyao and Sun were prevented from exercising their clear judgment, and Houji were prevented from carrying out his sowing and planting, then talents would lose their tasks, and the lord above would be burdened by labor. Thus, the emperor lets his cap’s tassels hang before his eyes and entrusts the world to all—when all under Heaven act according to their own nature, this is non-action that accomplishes everything.

Heaven and Earth nurture the transformation of the myriad things—this is what is meant by "self-so." The emperor and king practice non-action, and the world achieves success—success is accomplished by others.

Emulating the non-action of Heaven and Earth, the spirit and the expansive heart form the root of the five extremities. When movement follows nature, the five affairs do not falter but arise of themselves. What comes first is the root. Though the precedence of ruler and minister, father and son belongs to human affairs, it all arises from the supreme principle—it is not something the sage has fabricated. The order of honor and humility, before and after, is inherently fixed, something all things cannot do without. This is the sequence of the Great Dao, not merely what human relations esteem. The reason we adopt the Dao is because it possesses sequence. Once nature is made clear, things attain their proper Way. When things attain their Way, they harmonize; principle finds its own accord, and though it accords, it does not lose its proper place. Attaining one’s place, each thing fits its form; when form is made clear, nothing remains to be altered. When things act on their own, blame and responsibility are removed. Each regards attaining its nature as right and losing its nature as wrong. Rewards and punishments are the retribution for loss and attainment. The foolish and the wise, the noble and the base—each fits its capacity, follows the disposition of its abilities, and does not encroach upon another’s work. Names match their realities, so from name to reality there is no excess.

From clarifying Heaven to penal codes, there are five; from rewards and punishments, there are nine—all are the sequence of nature. Those who govern others must follow this sequence, first clarifying Heaven, not abandoning rewards and punishments. They must only not lose the order of before and after. He who employs all under Heaven must thoroughly understand the Way of sequence, entrusting it to those of appropriate talent—this is how the one above nurtures those below.

As the Lü commentary states: In non-action, one person employs all under Heaven, and all under Heaven serves him, thus there is surplus. In action, all under Heaven employs one person, and one person serves it, thus there is insufficiency. One who does not understand Heaven is not purely virtuous; virtue is simply non-action. Thus, when the one above practices non-action, those below also practice non-action and align with the above—this is called virtue. The Dao encompasses both Heaven and humanity: the Way of Heaven is non-action and honor, while the Way of humanity is action and entanglement. Thus, when those below act, the one above also acts and aligns with them—this is called the Dao. The one above must practice non-action to employ all under Heaven, while those below must act to serve all under Heaven—this is an unchanging Dao.

Therefore, the ancient kings of all under Heaven knew that they did not deliberate for themselves, yet all under Heaven deliberated for them; they did not please themselves with eloquence, yet all under Heaven pleased them; they did not act on their own, yet all under Heaven acted for them. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform—this is not my production. Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured—this is not my growth. The emperor and king practice non-action, yet all under Heaven achieves success—this is not my doing. This is how Heaven is divine, Earth is abundant, and the emperor and king are great. Non-action is how the Dao rides Heaven and Earth, gallops through the myriad things, and employs humanity.

Those who understand the five extremities must follow the movement of spirit and expansive heart, then comply with it. Thus, the so-called emptiness, tranquility, stillness, and non-action are the Way to preserve the spirit, clarify the heart, and nurture the root. Nurturing the root, the extremities follow. The extremities are what the ancients possessed but did not prioritize. The ruler leads and the minister follows; the husband leads and the wife follows—this is the sequence of honor and humility in the human Way. As for Heaven, it is positioned above through its divinity; Earth resides below through its clarity. Spring and summer generate and come first; autumn and winter complete and come after. Even the myriad things, from their initial transformation to sprouting, from their arising to differentiation, from the subtle to the manifest—all have their forms. In their flourishing and decline, their changes all follow established principles that cannot be altered. Heaven and Earth, though profoundly divine and unfathomable, possess an order of honor and humility, before and after. How then can the root and branches, the high and low of the human Way, be reversed?

Not only the precedence of ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife arise from the principle of Heaven and Earth. Even the ancestral temples, court assemblies, village gatherings, and momentary affairs—each has its own esteem and cannot be disordered. All are merely the sequence of the Great Dao. To speak of the Dao without its sequence—how can one attain the Dao? This is why the Hundred Schools have gone astray and not returned, and the Way of the sage-kings has remained obstructed and unfulfilled.

Heaven is the ultimate of nature and destiny. To clarify the Dao without understanding Heaven is to speak of a Dao that is not the Dao, a virtue that is not virtue. Only the true Dao and true virtue give rise to benevolence and righteousness. Benevolence on the left, righteousness on the right—there are divisions to uphold, forms to be seen, names to be spoken. With penal codes undisturbed, talents are employed without loss. Examining the heart within and scrutinizing conduct without, right and wrong attain their truth, rewards and punishments fit principle. The foolish and the wise occupy their proper places without daring to transgress; the noble and the base fulfill their positions without daring to exchange them. The benevolent and worthy, the unworthy—all follow their true natures without daring to feign. Assigning abilities to offices, each office performs its duties. Following names, each name matches its reality. In all matters—nurturing those below, governing things, cultivating the self—nothing does not proceed thus. Knowing that plans, if not used, must return to Heaven, this is how King Wen, though "not knowing, not perceiving," followed the pattern of the Lord, and the many officers of Zhou all upheld the virtue of Wen, responding to and revering Heaven. This is how great peace was achieved, rivaling the heights of Tang and Yu.

To hastily speak of penal codes and rewards without knowing their origin—are not Heaven and the Dao and virtue their origin? To invert is not to rectify; to take the branch as the root. To rush ahead is not to follow; to put last what should come first. To speak of the Dao without the sequence of root and branch, before and after, is to create disorder. Creating disorder, one becomes what others govern.

As the *Duyi* commentary states: The virtue of the emperor and king is rooted in Heaven and Earth, thus their encompassing and sustaining achievements are great.

The ruler abides in the Dao and virtue, thus the myriad things cannot sway him. Abiding in non-action, there is nothing that is not done. To act through action is to have insufficiency; to act through non-action is to have abundance. This is why the ancients prized non-action. Non-action is the Way of the superior; action is the Way of the inferior. The superior governs by the Dao, thus embracing all things; the inferior adheres to laws, thus being bound by things. If the superior does not embrace all things, it is not the virtue of emperors and kings; if the inferior does not bind himself to things, it is not the duty of a minister. This is the distinction between superior and inferior.

Those who ruled all under Heaven in ancient times followed the Dao in their conduct and moved in accord with principle, never displaying the advance of their actions. Knowing yet not considering it their own deliberation, discerning yet not taking pleasure in their own eloquence, capable yet not regarding it as their own doing, their virtue matched the transformative nurturing of Heaven and Earth, thus through non-action they achieved the accomplishments of all under Heaven.

The spiritual is the subtlety of the myriad things. The abundant is the accumulation of the myriad things. Heaven can be spiritual but not abundant; Earth can be abundant but not spiritual. Emperors and kings can embody both Heaven and Earth, their virtue filling the space between, which is what the *Yi* means by "the sage completes capabilities." This is the Way of riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the art of human governance.

That which is above form is the root of the Dao; that which is below form is its branch. The root is essential; the branch is detailed. The ruler’s Way is non-action, thus grasping the essential; the minister’s Way is action, thus valuing detail. The five branches of the inferior belong to this.

For emperors and kings, holding fast to the utmost essential and mastering the great root, the so-called branches will naturally rise. For ministers, dividing duties by office, each takes up his task, exerting their spirit, moving their minds, laboring diligently to the utmost, and only then do affairs follow and come to fruition.

Laws began with Fuxi and were completed under Yao. Once laws were established, those who studied the branches arose, not knowing that the Dao should come first. Thus, the lord leads and the minister follows; the father leads and the son follows—this is the natural principle.

The spiritual is the subtlety of illumination. Illumination is the coarse aspect of the spiritual. Heaven’s nature is spiritual; Earth’s nature is illumination. Heaven is noble, Earth is base—this is the positional distinction of the spiritual and the luminous. Spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow; the sage follows this pattern, rewarding first and punishing afterward.

Transformation is departing from non-being and entering being. Change is altering form and shifting appearance. Sprouting is the emergence of things. Distinction is how things differ from one another. The life and death, flourishing and decline, transformation and variation of the myriad things, their shapes not being uniform, all return to nature, following only the sequence of Heaven. How much more so for the great relationships of human ethics? If their order is lost, it contradicts Heaven and abandons humanity—how can this be the Dao?

All things depend on Heaven for their existence; none emerge without the Dao. The Dao within me is called virtue; with virtue, loving others is called benevolence; loving appropriately is called righteousness; precedence and hierarchy are called duty; not encroaching or overstepping is called observance.

Form is the embodiment of things. Name is the designation of things. According to their forms and names, tasks are assigned as fitting. Investigating their essence and examining their affairs, one then distinguishes right and wrong, clarifies rewards and punishments. The wise and the foolish are placed appropriately, the noble and the base occupy their proper positions. The benevolent and worthy, the incapable and unworthy, each exercises their abilities without falsifying their nature.

Abilities each have their limits; names must match reality. By this, one serves superiors and nurtures inferiors, governs things and cultivates the self. Then knowledge and schemes become useless and return to nature, and governance reaches its ultimate perfection.

The *Lost Books* are the *Unwritten Records*. All that have names are designated according to form—this is how the Dao disperses. If one is obscured by the Dao, then it is eternal, existing before Heaven and Earth, never having form, never having name, thus it cannot be what comes first.

The five are the center of yin and yang, what is called mandate. Only when it reaches mandate can things be named, thus the five transformations allow forms and names to be established. Nine is the extreme of yang numbers. Rewards and punishments measure the times and adapt to change, being the culmination of the Dao, thus nine transformations allow rewards and punishments to be discussed.

Punishments and names are the branches of the Dao. Rewards and punishments are its culmination. To speak of the Dao without seeking its origin is to invert and rush ahead. Those who are governed know the tools of governance; those who govern know the Way of governance. Knowing the tools of governance can be applied to all under Heaven but is insufficient to govern all under Heaven—these are the pedantic scholars, those of partial understanding, who are obscured by the Dao.

*Detailed Commentary on the Dao* states: First the needle, then the thread, and a curtain can be made; first the thread, then the needle, and clothing cannot be completed. Needle and thread are small things, yet they cannot be without order—how much more so for the Dao?

Zhuangzi was confused about human relationships, neglecting the principles of lord and minister, father and son; regarding the Way of Heaven, he expounded the principles of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. From Heaven to punishments and names, he clarified the naturalness of the Dao and things; from employing to rewards and punishments, he clarified the necessity of human affairs.

When employing is insufficient, then investigation and examination arise; when investigation and examination are insufficient, then right and wrong arise; when right and wrong are insufficient, then rewards and punishments arise. Though constant punishment is not the Way to govern all under Heaven, it is a tool of governance.

Bo Cheng Zigao left because Yu employed rewards and punishments, for he criticized taking the branches of governance as the root. Things have roots and branches; affairs have beginnings and endings. Punishments and names are things, thus to hastily speak of them is to not know their root. Rewards and punishments...

Thus, those who hastily speak of them do not know their beginning.

*Bi Xu’s Commentary:* Taking Heaven and Earth as the ancestral model, one does not claim seniority; taking the Dao and virtue as the master, one does not serve as a guest. Taking non-action as the constant, one remains unassuming and thus ever abundant.

The ruler’s loyalty admits all without exception—this is *ren*; the minister’s Way leaves nothing ungoverned—this is *yi*. The ruler should remain serene and inactive; if he were to act in the manner of a minister, he would fail to preside. The minister should attend to affairs with diligence; if he were to adopt the ruler’s virtue of receptivity, he would fail to serve. The ruler does not monopolize talent or seize ability, thus he governs through non-action and employs all under Heaven. The minister, bound to his office, labors in action to manage affairs, thus he is employed by all under Heaven through action.

From this we know: to comprehend Heaven and Earth, one must gather the counsel of the many; to carve and adorn the myriad things, one must seek the deliberation of the many; to exhaust the four seas, one must rely on the efforts of the many. Such is the enterprise of non-action.

Heaven descends *qi* to nurture growth, thus nothing is more divine than Heaven; Earth ascends *qi* to bring forth transformation, thus nothing is richer than Earth. When emperors and kings govern themselves and their works are accomplished, their virtue harmonizes with the Two Modes.

The root is called *li* (principle); the branch is called *shi* (affair). *Li* resides in simplicity and essentials—this is the ruler’s Way. *Shi* resides in thoroughness and completeness—this is the minister’s duty. Though root and branch differ, they must await the subtle operation of spirit and the unfolding of the mind’s function. First, one follows the root of *li*, then the branch of *shi* is manifested. The sequence of priority and posteriority arises naturally with things. Yet none but the sage can model this.

Establishing teachings by sequence, taking the Dao as the master: when standards are set, benefit and harm follow; employing the stations of nobility and baseness, the wise are rewarded and the foolish punished; according to the division of talents and abilities, names are pursued to seek reality.

The above nine items constitute the governance and teaching of the age. After five transformations, *xingming* (forms and names) may be implemented, drawing on the principle of the Five Phases’ generation and conquest. After nine transformations, rewards and punishments may be discussed, following the purport of the ninefold extreme changes of *yang*.

*Xingming* takes the *li* of Heaven and the Dao and virtue as its root; rewards and punishments take penal measures and ritual vessels as their beginning. To rely solely on rewards and punishments—is this not an inversion of the Dao? To speak out of sequence—is this not reckless discourse?

*Xingming* and rewards and punishments are the tools of governance; their subtle application and proper sequence are the Way of governance. *Kui* (implements) are what serve all under Heaven; *li* (principle) is what employs all under Heaven.

Names, numbers, rituals, and teachings are how inferiors serve superiors; non-action and self-transformation are how superiors nurture inferiors.

*Yongzhai* says: "Encompassing Heaven and Earth" speaks of its greatness; "carving the myriad things" speaks of its skill. The myriad things generate themselves—Heaven does not generate them; the myriad things grow themselves—Earth does not grow them. The emperor and king accomplish the work of all under Heaven through non-action, thus they are one with Heaven and Earth.

The essential lies with the ruler—his Way is non-action; the detailed lies with the minister—his Way is action. Military might is the auxiliary of civil virtue. Thus, the deployment of the five weapons is the branch of virtue. Illuminating punishments to assist teaching, rewards and punishments alongside the five penalties—these are the branches of teaching.

Ritual, law, *xingming*, bells, drums, feathers, and flutes—none are the root of ritual and music. The operation of spirit and the movement of the mind’s unfolding come first; then one follows them. This means all arises from the heart, not from external imposition.

Later scholars have addressed the branches, but these are not to be prioritized. This discussion is especially subtle. Even Zhuangzi never intended to entirely abandon weapons, punishments, rituals, or music. The key is to know the proper sequence, like the course of Heaven and Earth. What flourishes does not flourish all at once; what declines does not decline all at once. Thus it is said: "to kill."

Honoring age, rank, kinship, and worthiness—this too is the natural principle of all under Heaven.

Next, the sequence of governance is set forth in nine grades: dividing and guarding is the duty; penal measures are the standard. *Yinren* (employing according to duty) means assigning tasks based on office. *Yuan* means exemption; *sheng* means elimination. If one does not undertake the affair, one is exempted and removed from it. *Shifei* (right and wrong) means distinguishing the good from the wicked. Rewards and punishments mean striking to record them, chariots and robes to manifest them, and the like. The foolish and wise are placed appropriately—this means matching the task. *Lüwei* means occupying the proper station. *Xi* means peace—when one’s true nature is at peace, then abilities follow names, each finds its place without contrivance, and all returns to spontaneity.

Though ancient texts speak of *xingming*, they never sought the branch by uniting it with the root. If one does not know priority and posteriority and speaks hastily, one loses the root and beginning. This is to be employed by all under Heaven rather than employing all under Heaven.

*Xingming* and rewards and punishments are the tools of governance; dividing and guarding *ren* and *yi* are the Way of governance. *Xingming* is *xingming* (forms and names)—the ancient script used them interchangeably.

To take Heaven and Earth as the ancestral model and the Dao and virtue as the master—what else is there? Simply to take non-action as the constant.

The attainment of non-action is already difficult—how much more so its constancy without change? This is why the ancients prized it. Non-action and action distinguish superior from inferior. To reverse this is for the ruler to fail in rulership and the minister to cease being a minister.

Not claiming thought as one’s own, not delighting in discrimination as one’s own, not asserting ability as one’s own—this is the root of non-action. Heaven does not produce yet things transform; Earth does not grow yet things nurture; the emperor and king do not act yet the world achieves merit—this is the efficacy of non-action. To call it "spiritual" or "abundant and great" suffices to encompass it. This is how the imperial virtue matches Heaven and Earth, rides upon them, and sets the myriad things and human affairs in motion—its surplus concerns, while its fundamental essence remains in the unelucidated principle of spontaneity.

From the three armies and five weapons to the gradations of ceremonial attire—though these are the least of the five affairs—yet they all depend on the movement of spirit and the defense of the mind, which the ancients did not discard, though they were not primary.

As for the order of ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, it is like the unalterable hierarchy of Heaven’s honor and Earth’s humility, from which the sage took his model. The positions of spirit and brightness are not disordered above and below; the sequence of the four seasons has its proper order. The transformations and creations of the myriad things take form in their respective categories, and the flourishing and decline of things become manifest. This is the order of Heaven and Earth, which humans take as their standard.

In ancestral temples, court assemblies, village communities, and all undertakings, there is always order, and the Way resides within it. To speak of the Way yet reject order—what Way is there to grasp? Thus, from first illuminating Heaven to the subsequent sequence of the Dao and virtue, down to the worthy and unworthy following their true nature—all depend on this order and cannot be without it. Each is assigned their abilities to examine their efficacy, and each is assessed by their names to verify their reality. Serving superiors and nurturing subordinates, governing things and cultivating oneself—nothing surpasses this as the essential method.

When schemes and plans are unused and all returns to spontaneity, this is the ultimate governance of Great Peace.

The subsequent quotation from the classics, "to nurture all under Heaven," expands upon the preceding residual meaning.

**Heavenly Dao, Third Chapter**

Long ago, Shun asked Yao: "How does the Heavenly King employ his mind?"
Yao replied: "I do not slight the destitute, nor abandon the impoverished. I grieve for the dead, cherish the young, and pity women. This is how I employ my mind."
Shun said: "Noble indeed, yet not yet great."
Yao asked: "Then how should it be?"
Shun said: "In embodying the virtue of Heaven, one emerges in tranquility. The sun and moon shine, the four seasons proceed, as day and night follow their constant course, and clouds move while rain descends."
Yao exclaimed: "How entangled and restless! You align with Heaven; I align with man."
Now, Heaven and Earth are what the ancients deemed greatest, what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all jointly admired. Thus, those who in ancient times ruled all under Heaven—what did they do? They simply followed Heaven and Earth!

**Guo’s Annotation:**
The "destitute" are the so-called impoverished. "Not abandoning" means constantly bestowing grace. Aligning with Heaven’s virtue, though active, remains still; the four seasons and day and night all proceed without contrivance, spontaneously. "Entangled and restless" suggests the eye suspects busyness, hence it is said: those who in ancient times ruled all under Heaven—what did they do? They simply embodied Heaven’s virtue.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
In Heaven’s virtue, though active, one is never without tranquility. The sun and moon shine, the four seasons proceed—advancing and retreating, bending and extending—none acts by design. Day and night follow their course, succeeding one another without awareness of their origin; clouds move and rain descends, and all under Heaven is evenly nurtured. Compared to this, is not "not slighting the destitute, not abandoning the impoverished" entangled and restless? What Shun spoke aligns with Heaven; what Yao spoke aligns with man. Yet the Confucians of the world know Yao only thus. Therefore, the text attributes this to the two sages to clarify that what is greatest and jointly admired lies precisely here, no different from the Yellow Emperor.

**Yi Du’s Annotation:**
"Not slighting the destitute... pitying women" expresses the intent of "not daring to disrespect the widowed and orphaned." Noble indeed, yet unable to extend grace to all generations without ceasing to be benevolent—this is why it is not yet great. Heaven’s virtue is the natural Dao, attained within oneself. Thus, though active, one is never without stillness. Like the sun and moon, the four seasons, clouds moving and rain descending—do these have a mind for the things of all under Heaven? The way of emperors and kings should be thus. Hearing Shun’s words, Yao realized his former employment of mind was entangled and restless, mired in human effort and ignorant of Heaven’s virtue. Hence, he deemed Shun aligned with Heaven and himself aligned with man. Aligned with Heaven means being one with Heaven; aligned with man means being one with man. Heaven and Earth cover and bear the myriad things, their virtue extending everywhere. Those who would be emperors and kings must embody this. Even the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun could not surpass the virtue of aligning with Heaven and Earth in their greatness.

**Xiang Dao’s Annotation:**
"Not slighting the destitute... pitying women" is benevolence. "Heaven’s virtue emerging in tranquility... clouds moving and rain descending" is the Dao. Benevolence is human, yet nothing is left undone—hence "aligned with man." The Dao is Heaven, yet nothing is done—hence "aligned with Heaven." Yet Yao and Shun followed the same Dao. Yao practiced Heaven’s Dao but spoke of man; Shun practiced man’s Dao but spoke of Heaven. Practicing Heaven yet aligning with man, his virtue attained only the beauty of fulfillment. Practicing man yet aligning with Heaven, his achievement culminated in the greatness of radiance. "Entangled" describes its confinement; "restless" describes its movement.

**Bi Xu’s Annotation:**
"Not slighting the destitute, not abandoning the impoverished"—the heart of a benevolent person cannot surpass this. Shun deemed it flawed, for it had not yet transcended, hence not yet great. In Heaven’s virtue emerging in tranquility, human affairs are moved. The sequence of dusk and dawn, the constancy of opening and closing, the ascent and descent of qi in exchange—these are the virtues of Heaven and Earth. Yao realized his own conduct was entangled and restless, disordered and again disordered. Aligning with Heaven is without mind; aligning with man is with effort. Heaven and Earth are what the ancients deemed greatest. Those who rule all under Heaven simply embody them.

**Yong Qi’s Annotation:**
Heaven’s virtue is the virtue of spontaneity. "Emerging in tranquility" means acting without acting. The sun and moon shine, the four seasons proceed—all are natural movements, one aspect of non-action. Thus, day and night follow their constant course without error; clouds move and rain descends, shaping the myriad things. Those who would rule all under Heaven embody this to establish virtue, and the people all return to it; they expand it to transform things, and things all follow. At these words, Yao reflected and suddenly realized: his former conduct—entangled and restless—how far removed was Heaven’s alignment from man’s! Viewed thus, the virtues of Yao and Shun seem to have a distinction, yet concluding with what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun jointly admired, they merge indistinguishably. Such is the subtlety of *Nanhua*’s rhetoric—its rises and falls, openings and closings. Scholars who savor it deeply will grasp it for themselves.

Confucius wished to deposit his books in the Zhou archives. Zilu advised: "I have heard that the Zhou’s archivist, an elder named Lao Dan, has retired and lives at home. If you wish to deposit your books, Master, you might first visit him."
Confucius said: "Excellent."
He went to see Lao Dan, who refused. Thereupon, he expounded the Twelve Classics to persuade him.

Lao Dan, struck by his discourse, said: "Too verbose! I would hear its essence."
Confucius replied: "The essence lies in *ren* and *yi*."
Lao Dan asked: "May I ask—are *ren* and *yi* man’s inherent nature?"
Confucius said: "Indeed. The noble man who lacks *ren* cannot be perfected; without *yi*, he cannot live. *Ren* and *yi* are the true nature of the realized person! What more could one seek?"
Lao Dan said: "May I ask—what are *ren* and *yi*?"
Confucius replied: "Joy in all things from the heart, universal love without partiality—this is the essence of *ren* and *yi*."
Lao Dan said: "Your latter words nearly miss the mark. Is not universal love impractical? And ‘without partiality’—is that not itself partiality? If you, Master, wish to ensure the world does not lose its shepherds, then know: Heaven and Earth have their constancy, sun and moon their brightness, stars their constellations, beasts their herds, trees their standing. You, Master, should emulate virtue and follow the Dao in your conduct—this is already perfection. Why then clamorously brandish *ren* and *yi* like one beating a drum to seek a lost child? Alas! You, Master, confuse man’s nature!"

Guo’s commentary: "Joy in all things from the heart, universal love without partiality—this is what the common world calls *ren* and *yi*. Thus, the text borrows Confucius to let Laozi correct it. The utmost *ren* advances without love. What the world calls ‘without partiality’ is abandoning oneself to love others, desiring others’ love in return—this is extreme partiality, not the public-mindedness that forgets the public! From ‘Heaven and Earth have their constancy’ to ‘trees their standing’—all are self-sufficient, needing no universal love. Love arises as events demand, ceasing when *yi* is fulfilled—this is forgetting *ren* and *yi*. To dwell on them constantly is to disorder the true."

Lü’s commentary: "Confucius, unheeded in his time, wished to store his teachings to await later noble men. The Twelve Classics refer to the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, wherein Confucius’ way of ordering the world lies. Teaching the world through the human Dao, he concealed its subtle workings without ever speaking of them—thus, the Twelve Classics’ way of ordering the world reduces to *ren* and *yi* alone. Laozi, cutting off learning to return to simplicity, revealed the true—thus *ren* and *yi* were to be cast aside, and he rightly deemed them not man’s inherent nature. From the human Dao’s perspective, *ren* not only perfects oneself but also perfects things; *yi* not only benefits things but also establishes the self. The noble man’s life and completion lie in *ren* and *yi*, hence they are deemed the true nature of the realized person. From the true perspective of the Dao, joy in all things from the heart is not imposed from without—without things, there is no lack of joy. The highest *ren* acts without acting. Laozi’s words nearly approach the truth but fall short; his later words on universal love are mistaken. The Heavenly virtue emerges in tranquility, clouds drift and rain falls—this is why he deemed it impractical. All names arise from insufficiency—thus ‘without partiality’ is itself partiality. To wish the world not lose its shepherds is merely to assist the self-so of the myriad things. Heaven and Earth have constancy, trees their standing—this is what is meant by the self-so of things. Virtue is non-action; the Dao follows the natural. Why then clamorously act like one beating a drum to seek a lost child? This speaks of man’s loss of nature—it cannot be restored through *ren* and *yi*."

Yi Du’s commentary: "The *zhengcang* historian was the official in charge of storing books. Confucius, his Dao unfulfilled, wished to store his books in the Zhou archives to await later generations. At the time, Lao Dan had resigned and returned home. Confucius went to rely on him, but Lao Dan refused. Confucius had edited the *Odes*, settled the *Documents*, revised the *Rites* and *Music*, and composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals*—six classics—and expounded the *Changes* with six commentaries, making twelve classics in all. He expounded these to Lao Dan, who deemed them fragmented and overly cautious, wishing to hear their essence. Confucius answered that the essence lay in *ren* and *yi*. Lao Dan, roaming beyond the world’s bounds, held that *ren* and *yi* were not natural nature. Confucius, roaming within the world’s bounds, held that *ren* and *yi* were the true nature of the realized person. Man’s heart naturally desires all things to be joyful, universally loved without partiality—this is the natural sentiment of human nature, further clarifying that *ren* and *yi* arise from nature. Lao Dan said, ‘Alas! Your latter words nearly miss the mark.’ Universal love still implies attachment—it does not compare to the utmost love without love. ‘Without partiality’ still implies partiality—it does not compare to not knowing partiality as partiality. If you, Master, wish to ensure the world does not lose its nurture, it is better to let things follow their nature, so they love one another without knowing it as *ren*, befriend one another without knowing it as *yi*. From ‘Heaven and Earth have constancy’ to ‘trees their standing’—all are non-action and self-so, each fully realizing its nature. Emulating virtue without knowing virtue as virtue, following the Dao without knowing the Dao as Dao—why then clamorously brandish *ren* and *yi* in the world to seek the restoration of nature, no different from beating a drum to seek a lost child?"

Detailed Daoist commentary: "Laozi’s teaching takes the Dao and virtue as its foundation; Confucius’ classics take *ren* and *yi* as their root. Emulating virtue and following the Dao, the world attains nature through non-action; dwelling in *ren* and practicing *yi*, the world acts and betrays its nature. This is why Zhuangzi records Confucius’ advancement to clarify it. ‘Joy in all things from the heart’ is delighting in each thing. Universal love is *ren*; without partiality is *yi*. Universal love still excludes some—it is not the utmost *ren*. The utmost *ren* has no favorites. ‘Without partiality’ still fulfills partiality—it is not the utmost *yi*. The utmost *yi* does not regard things. Thus, the noble man values forgetting *ren* and *yi* to seek their utmost. Confucius once told Lao Dan: ‘I have studied the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*—I have long considered myself accomplished.’ This reference to the Twelve Classics means doubling the Six Classics into twelve."

The *Bixu Commentary* states: Confucius wished to store his books, but Lao Dan would not permit it, saying that what had already been presented was like straw dogs—unworthy of preservation. The Six Classics, when expanded, become twelve. Supreme *ren* achieves completion through non-action; supreme *yi* reaches fulfillment without being enacted. To act by following one’s nature—how could this be artificial? Delighting in things (*wu kai*) means one has not yet forgotten emotion; being without partiality still leaves traces. The emotions of *ren* and *yi* are far removed from the Dao!

It is like the constancy of spring’s growth and autumn’s harvest, the alternation of day’s sun and night’s moon, the fixed array of stars traversing the heavens, the flocking of birds and herding of beasts, the rootedness of grasses and trees—one may imitate and follow these, but why exert oneself so anxiously? *Yongzhai* says: "He stored the books in the Western Zhou" refers to traveling west to Zhou to examine its archives. "Expanded" (*fan*) means to speak of them repeatedly. "Reaching the midpoint of his discourse" means that when Confucius had spoken only halfway, Laozi deemed his words too diffuse.

*Wu kai* means taking joy in things. "Later words" refers to shallow and superficial speech. *Ji* means peril. How can one practice universal love when things are unequal? This is a convoluted and impractical doctrine. As soon as one acquires the name of being without partiality, the notion of partiality arises in the heart. If one wishes the world to lack nothing in its nurturance, then every thing possesses its own natural creation—how can human effort intervene? One should merely emulate the virtue of nature and follow the Dao of nature, and thus attain it!

"Beating the drum to seek a runaway child" describes disturbing the common customs. Confucius, seeing the decline of the age and the obscurity of the Dao, wished to store his deluded books in Zhou’s archives to await a sage of later generations. Though compelled to entrust empty words to posterity to establish teachings, his resolve was earnest. Laozi’s refusal stemmed from shame: since the Dao was not practiced in his own time, what use were mere dregs?

The Twelve Classics are interpreted variously. Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* in the old commentary lists the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals* as the Six Classics, adding the Six Wefts to make twelve. Another account includes the *Changes*’ upper and lower canons with the *Ten Wings*. Yet another claims the *Spring and Autumn Annals* of the Twelve Dukes were composed by Confucius. This last interpretation seems most plausible. In any case, these are metaphorical references meant to convey meaning, and one need not fixate on their enumeration.

"Reaching the midpoint of his discourse" means that when Confucius spoke, his words were merely verbose and not essential. Confucius said the essentials lie in *ren* and *yi*, which are the foremost principles for governing the world. Lao Dan countered that these are not inherent in human nature, for returning to simplicity and reverting to the root reveals the presence of the Dao and virtue. Confucius replied with "delighting in things from the heart." Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* notes that *wu* was originally written as *wu* ("do not"), and this reading is adopted here. The word *zhong* ("heart") should be pronounced in the departing tone, so that one is neither centered nor resentful. Thus, universal love without partiality constitutes the emotions of *ren* and *yi*.

Lao Dan said: "Perilous are words that fall short"—this is why they are distant from the Dao. Precisely because one is without partiality, one fulfills partiality. If one wishes the world to lack nothing in its nurturance, then heaven and earth, sun and stars, birds and beasts, grasses and trees—none fail to follow their natures and fulfill their proper places. When humans let virtue flow freely and follow the Dao, it is no different. Why then exert effort in *ren* and *yi*, like beating a drum to seek a lost child, which yields no result?

Shi Chengqi met Laozi and asked: "I have heard that you, Master, are a sage. I did not hesitate to travel a great distance, wishing to see you, journeying a hundred stages with calloused feet and never daring to rest. Now I observe you, and you are no sage. You have surplus grain in your rat holes yet discard your younger sister—this is not *ren*. Before you, cooked and raw foods are not exhausted, yet you hoard without limit." Laozi remained silent and did not respond.

The next day, Shi Chengqi met him again and said: "Yesterday, I criticized you, but now my heart has corrected itself. Why is this?" Laozi replied: "Those who are artfully wise and spiritually sagely—I consider myself beyond such things. In the past, when you called me an ox, you took me for an ox; when you called me a horse, you took me for a horse. If something truly possesses a reality, and others give it a name but one does not accept it, one incurs misfortune twice over. I wear what I wear, but I do not wear it because it is wearable."

Shi Chengqi walked like a crow, avoiding his shadow, and advanced to ask: "How should one cultivate the self?" Laozi said: "Your demeanor is haughty, your gaze piercing, your forehead lofty, your mouth gaping, your appearance stern—you resemble a horse reined in. When you move, you restrain; when you act, you are like a crossbow’s trigger. When you observe, you scrutinize; when you know, you are clever but see only excess. All this is to lack trustworthiness. At the borderlands, there is a man called Thief."

Laozi said: "The Dao is not exhausted in the great nor neglected in the small, so all things are complete within it. Vast is its capacity to embrace all; profound is its unfathomability. Forms, virtue, *ren*, and *yi* are the mere tips of spirit—who but the perfected person can stabilize them? The perfected person possesses the world—is this not grand? Yet it is not enough to burden him. Though the world strives and struggles, he does not join them; though he discerns no reliance, he does not shift for profit. He exhausts the truth of things and preserves their root, thus transcending heaven and earth, forgetting the myriad things, and his spirit is never troubled.

"In penetrating the Dao and uniting with virtue, he retreats from *ren* and *yi* and sets aside rites and music—thus the perfected person’s heart is settled." Guo’s commentary states: "Surplus grain in rat holes" means he does not cherish things. "Discarding his younger sister" means lacking familial affection. "Cooked and raw foods not exhausted before him" means he is utterly sufficient, hence always has surplus. All things return to his embrace, and whatever comes, he receives—he does not set narrow boundaries. His self-reproach for mockery and criticism is what startles. *Tuo* means "to have passed beyond." Calling him an ox or a horse follows whatever name things are given.

Possessing reality, he does not let praise or blame weigh upon his heart. If he were to receive them in his heart, both name and reality would become burdens—thus he would suffer calamity.

*Fu* means the bearing of one’s conduct. Not allowing praise or blame to bring calamity upon himself, he remains unchanged in his demeanor. If he were to act with deliberate effort, he could not maintain this constancy.

*Yairan* describes restless haste in advancing. *Chong* means "to emerge." *Erán* reveals what is manifest. *Quērán* is an open, gaping appearance. *Yìrán* is the look of one lifting the brows and staring with pride.

His will is set on swift movement, never at ease or unrestrained. His choices and rejections are rapid, his judgment clear and decisive—thus he is able to settle the hearts of all under heaven.

**Heavenly Dao, Chapter Four**

What the world values as the Dao are books, yet books are nothing more than words, and words have their own value. What is valued in words is meaning, and meaning follows something beyond. What meaning follows cannot be transmitted through speech, yet the world clings to antiquity and venerates transmitted texts. Though the world holds them in esteem, they are still not truly worthy of esteem, for what is esteemed is not what ought to be esteemed.

What can be seen at a glance are forms and colors; what can be heard are names and sounds. Alas! The world takes forms, colors, names, and sounds as sufficient to grasp the true nature of things, yet forms, colors, names, and sounds are fundamentally insufficient to grasp that nature. Thus, the wise do not speak, and those who speak are not wise—how could the world recognize this?

Duke Huan was reading in the hall. Below, Wheelwright Bian was carving a wheel. Setting aside his mallet and chisel, he ascended and asked the Duke: "May I ask, what words are contained in what Your Lordship reads?" The Duke replied: "The words of sages." Bian said: "Are the sages still alive?" The Duke said: "They are already dead." Bian said: "Then what Your Lordship reads are but the dregs of the ancients!" The Duke said: "How dare a wheelwright comment on what I read? If you have an explanation, speak; if not, you die." Wheelwright Bian said: "Your servant observes this from his own craft. When carving a wheel, if done too slowly, it is smooth but not firm; if too swiftly, it is rough and does not fit. Neither too slow nor too swift—it is grasped by the hand and responds to the heart. The mouth cannot express it, yet a certain art resides within. I cannot make my son understand it, nor can my son receive it from me. Thus, though I am seventy years old, I still carve wheels in my old age. The ancients, along with what could not be transmitted, are dead. What Your Lordship reads are but the lees and husks of the ancients!"

Guo’s commentary: What is truly valuable lies beyond words and meaning. Thus, only those who forget speech and abandon books can grasp the true nature of things. Wheelwright Bian’s inability to instruct his son shows that each thing has its own nature, and teaching is of no avail. The affairs of the ancients have perished in the present; even if transmitted, how could they make the past live again? The past does not exist in the present, and present affairs have already changed. Therefore, one must abandon learning, follow one’s nature, and adapt to the times to attain the Way.

Lü’s commentary: Zhuangzi speaks thus to urge scholars to forget words and books and not seek the Dao amid forms, colors, names, and sounds. Even in wheel-carving, a coarse craft, the balance of swiftness and slowness, the smoothness and roughness grasped by the hand and responding to the heart—even father and son cannot transmit or receive this. How much more difficult is it to transmit the Dao! If one cannot seek it in the heart but only reads books, then the metaphor of lees and husks is no empty word.

Yi Du’s commentary: The *Book of Changes* says: "Books do not exhaust speech, and speech does not exhaust meaning." Thus, what books record are but traces. The world believes books suffice to encompass the Dao, but this is ignorance of the Dao. Those who speak all value meaning, yet meaning follows the Dao without end. If speech cannot transmit it, how can books be worthy of esteem? What the world values is not what ought to be valued.

What cannot be spoken is the whole of the Dao; what can be spoken is but a fragment. The Dao arises naturally from the spontaneity of life and destiny. It must be met in formlessness, followed to its utmost principle, heard in silence, and seen in obscurity. Yet the world, confounding the constant nature of spontaneity, seeks the stale traces of former kings—striving further, they lose further.

The ears and eyes perceive only forms, colors, names, and sounds; the same is true of books. Yet the world, deluded and losing its nature, takes forms, colors, names, and sounds as sufficient to grasp the true nature of things—how lamentable! If one could forget forms, colors, names, and sounds, abandon speech and books, follow the heart, and meet with meaning, then the supreme principles of heaven and earth, the great truths of life and destiny, could be known without words.

Wheelwright Bian, seeing Duke Huan deluded by the stale traces of former kings and ignorant of the root of the great Dao, used the craft of wheel-carving to enlighten him. It lies in following principle without losing one’s nature. Neither too swift nor too slow, grasped by the hand and responding to the heart—this is the natural principle residing within. The mouth cannot express it, hence he could not instruct his son and carved wheels into old age. Wheel-carving is but a minor skill, yet even it cannot be transmitted through words—how much less can one seek the Dao in books? Only the adept scholar reads books to seek their meaning, discards their traces, and meets with their heart, thus avoiding Wheelwright Bian’s rebuke.

Xiang Dao’s commentary: Words in books relate to meaning as forms, colors, names, and sounds relate to true nature. True nature cannot be grasped through forms, colors, names, and sounds, nor can meaning be transmitted through words in books—this is certain! Thus, the adept in the *Book of Changes* grasps meaning and forgets images, grasps images and forgets words. The adept in the *Book of Odes* grasps intent and forgets phrases, grasps phrases and forgets lines. Is this not what is meant by discarding sacrificial straw dogs after the ritual, or casting away dregs to keep the pure wine? It was through Wheelwright Bian that Duke Huan awakened to the futility of reading books, just as Wang Shou, through Xu Feng, rose to dance and burn his books.

Bi Xu’s commentary: The ancients are gone, leaving only their words in books—how can these be worthy of esteem? It is like describing the five flavors: one can only speak of their forms, colors, names, and sounds, but the tastes of sweetness and bitterness can never be conveyed. Abandon forms, colors, names, and sounds, and the wise do not speak—thus one attains it. Wheelwright Bian’s hand responding to his heart, his ineffable skill—this is the art residing within, the reason he practiced it all his life. As years change with time, the Dao renews daily. When the ancients spoke of this, they could not but sigh with emotion.

Yongzhai’s words: Books can convey the Dao, which is why they are valued—the value lies in the Dao, not in the books.

To speak in terms of the Dao is why such words are esteemed, yet what is esteemed lies in the meaning, not in the words. Where meaning directs, words cannot convey it—thus neither words nor books are worthy of esteem. Forms and colors may be seen, names and sounds may be heard, but the Dao cannot be seen or heard. That世人 seek its reality through forms, colors, names, and sounds is truly lamentable!

This passage elucidates the earlier idea, illustrating with exquisite analogy that the Dao cannot be transmitted through words. Books record the words of the ancients, but when the ancients are gone, how can what they could not convey be obtained? Does the guest in the brewery know the taste of wine? Tracks are what shoes produce, yet tracks are not shoes. Books are where the Dao resides, yet books are not the Dao. The enlightened use books to clarify the Dao; the deluded abandon the Dao to seek books. Thus, Duke Huan was drowned in stale words, while Wheelwright Bian could advance his persuasion.

Using the coarse to illustrate the refined, drawing principles from concrete affairs—there is nothing that is not the Dao. The crafting of a new wheel involves selecting wood and applying skill to bear weight and travel far, a metaphor for embracing the Dao and holding virtue to benefit the world. The marvel of his axe-work, responding to his heart with his hands, could not be passed even from father to son. The measures of round and square, long and short, the rhythms of swift and slow, the nuances of sweet and bitter—all arise naturally, beyond the reach of words or books. How much less can the Dao of gods and emperors, which gives birth to heaven and earth, be exhausted in writing?

Bian devoted his life to this wheel—not to toil over hammer and chisel, straining sinew and bone, but to advance his skill through the Dao, uniting heaven with heaven. Grasping the essence of wheel-making, he expended little effort yet achieved much, and so followed it all his life without abandon. Extending this principle to books presents no difficulty.

Duke Huan, fixated on traces and neglecting the heart, declared the sages dead, allowing Bian to exhaust his words and correct his error. What the sages and worthies studied was the Dao; what they transmitted was the heart. If one grasps the heart, one knows the undying remains—this Dao can be attained in stillness, how could it lie in the clamorous dregs of paper?

This reveals that the sages and worthies spoke and wrote out of necessity, and *Nanhua* uses this to dispel the world’s attachment to images and clinging to texts. If scholars can truly see the moon and forget the finger, restoring their primordial nature, then looking back at those who clutch their books, they will not deign even to laugh. This passage’s intent resembles the "Butcher Ding" chapter, though it lacks Duke Huan’s acknowledgment—leaving this phrase for later generations, who will surely take it up.

This section is titled *The Dao of Heaven*, prominently displayed at its head. Next, it discusses the sagely Dao of emperors and kings, the undertakings of mysterious sages and plain kings, with virtue and power as the foundation, and the constancy of non-action—this is the Dao of riding heaven and earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the human and earthly. Within it, the tools of governance—virtue, teaching, ritual, music, benevolence, righteousness, division of duties, forms and names, rewards and punishments—are all complete, yet none depart from the constancy of the human Dao.

Why? Those who discourse well on the Dao of Heaven must root it in the human; those who fully realize the human Dao may match Heaven. Heaven and humanity communicate, root and branch are one, vast and all-embracing, deep and unfathomable—how can one know that Heaven is not human, or human not Heaven? As for the five transformations where forms and names may be raised, or the nine transformations where rewards and punishments may be spoken—these are unchanging principles for all ages, the means by which human standards exalt the Dao of Heaven.

When Heaven’s virtue emerges in tranquility, the sun and moon shine and the four seasons proceed, like the constancy of day and night, the movement of clouds and the descent of rain—Heaven acts of itself, radiant and uniquely transformative. How could the Dao of Earth or the Dao of Humanity not follow? Governing tools are cultivated to order the Dao, a general discussion of the Dao through the ages. Yet some use them to bring order, others to bring chaos, for they do not know the sequence of root and branch, priority and posteriority, or the proper balance of ruler and minister.

The world claims *Nanhua*’s teachings favor non-action and neglect governing tools, but observing the rituals, music, and political teachings expounded here—profound and subtle—none of the other masters can compare. All arise from the natural principles of Heaven, merely enacted through humanity. Truly understanding natural principles, one can use governing tools to penetrate the Dao of governance, so that ruler and minister, father and son, birds and beasts, grasses and trees all find their proper place. The world sings and plays *ji rang*, unaware of imperial influence—this is what is called non-action.

As for Confucius wishing to hide books and unraveling the classics to expound, or Cheng Qi asking about self-cultivation while his demeanor remained haughty—these were cases of clinging to humanity and forgetting Heaven, which Lao Dan did not approve. Only the perfected know benevolence and righteousness as the branches of the Dao, ritual and music as its guests. They can be Heaven and be human, upholding constancy and guarding the root, their spirit never troubled. Though the world exists, it does not burden them.

The conclusion, through Wheelwright Bian’s analogy of books and dregs, warns scholars not to chase traces and neglect the heart, pursuing the branch and forsaking the root, thus drifting ever farther from the Dao. One should investigate what the sages left that does not perish. Scholars should sever learning to enter transmission, and transmitters should attain the transmission beyond transmission—then the hearts of Heaven, Earth, and the sages will be revealed. Why cling to the dregs of the ancients?

**Heavenly Revolution (Chapter One)**

Does Heaven revolve? Does Earth abide?
Do the sun and moon contend for their places?
Who governs and sustains this?
Who binds and upholds this?
Who, dwelling in non-action, propels and enacts this?
Is there some mechanism, sealed and inescapable?
Or does it turn ceaselessly, unable to halt itself?

Do clouds give rise to rain? Does rain give rise to clouds?
Who bestows and dispenses this?
Who, dwelling in non-action, indulges in excess yet urges this on?

The wind rises from the north, now west, now east,
now soaring, now wandering—who breathes and draws this in?
Who, dwelling in non-action, spreads and scatters this?

I venture to ask: what is the reason for all this?

Wu Xian of the Shao lineage declared: Come, let me tell you.

Heaven possesses the Six Ultimates and the Five Constants. Should emperors and kings align with them, there is order; should they defy them, there is calamity. The affairs of the *Nine* and the *Luo*—when governance is perfected and virtue complete—illumine and oversee the earth below, and all under heaven bear them aloft. This is called the Supreme August.

Guo Xiang’s commentary: Heaven does not revolve yet moves of itself; Earth does not abide yet rests of itself; the sun and moon do not contend for their places yet alternate and pass away of themselves. Who governs and sustains this? Who binds and upholds this? If there is nothing, then nothing can propel it; if there is something, each has its own affairs. Then who, dwelling in non-action, propels and enacts this? Each moves of itself—it cannot be known.

Clouds and rain cannot give rise to one another; each is so of itself. If one asks why they are so of themselves, for proximate affairs of things, one may know the reason, yet when tracing origins to the ultimate, there is no reason—they are simply so of themselves. Learned posturing may change, but Heaven’s nature cannot be defied!

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: Heaven’s revolution, Earth’s abiding—I know not their true revolution or true abiding. The sun and moon contending for their places—I know not their true contention. Seeking what gives rise, binds, upholds, or propels and enacts this—all prove unattainable. Is there some mechanism, sealed and inescapable? Or does it turn ceaselessly, unable to halt itself? This I cannot know.

Water ascends to become clouds; clouds disperse to become rain. Seeking what bestows and dispenses this, or what, dwelling in non-action, indulges in excess yet urges this on—proves unattainable. The wind rises from the west, now east, now wandering without fixed course. Seeking what breathes and draws this in, or what, dwelling in non-action, spreads and scatters this—proves unattainable. This is the unfathomable Dao manifesting as the numinous! To know the numinous in its workings is to see that what governs, sustains, bestows, and scatters—all arise from this alone.

The Five Constants are the Five Fortunes. Employing the Five Fortunes brings authority; employing the Six Ultimates brings awe. Aligning with them brings fortune; defying them brings calamity. The *Nine* and the *Luo* refer to the *Luo Scripture* and the *Nine Categories*. When the application of the Nine Categories reaches its utmost in fortune and extremity, governance is perfected and virtue complete. Illumining and overseeing the earth below, all under heaven bear them aloft—this is how the Supreme August is attained.

The Supreme August grasps Heaven and Earth, drives the sun and moon, bestows clouds and rain, breathes and draws in the winds and qi, yet ever dwells in the realm of non-action. Must one seek this in the primordial age of remote antiquity?

Lin Yidu’s commentary: Heaven, round, moves of itself—does it act with intent to revolve? Earth, square, rests of itself—does it act with intent to abide? The sun and moon come and go without cessation—thus they do not contend. Heaven’s revolution—who governs and directs it? Earth’s abiding—who binds and upholds it? The sun and moon’s coming and going—who, dwelling in non-action, propels and enacts this? All are so of themselves—how could there be agency in their midst?

Is there necessarily some mechanism, turning ceaselessly yet unable to halt itself? Heaven and Earth are form; revolution and turning are the Dao. The movement of the mechanism is neither compelled nor voluntary. The qi of yin and yang, when pent up, becomes clouds. Rain is the harmony of yin and yang. Clouds bring forth rain, yet there are times they cannot. Clouds becoming rain, rain becoming clouds—who initiates or ceases this? Who, dwelling in non-action, indulges in excess yet urges this on? All is unknowable—they simply are so of themselves!

Heaven generates water in the north, thus the wind rises from the north, now east, now west, soaring and wandering above. Who breathes and draws this in, or spreads and scatters it to make it so? The Six Ultimates are the four directions, above and below. The Five Constants are the Five Phases. All arise naturally, their reasons unknown. Should emperors and kings align with their principles, there is order; should they defy them, there is calamity.

The *Nine* and *Luo* refer to the nine regions and their settlements. This speaks of the emperor’s virtue broadly bestowed, distant peoples at peace, as the sun and moon illumine and oversee the earth below—all under heaven bear them aloft. Delighting in governance, at ease in life, the people’s nature returns to simplicity, as in the age of the Supreme August.

Chen Xiangdao’s commentary: Heaven and Earth’s revolution and abiding, the sun and moon’s coming and going—clouds emerge from Earth yet root in Heaven; rain descends from Heaven yet roots in Earth; the wind blows straight from the east yet arises from the north. Their covering and bearing, their illumining and overseeing, their scattering and moistening—is any of this willed? All is borne by the Dao’s spontaneity!

Now, the wild horses of the plains drift yet do not move; whirlwinds topple mountains yet remain still; rivers rush yet do not flow; the sun and moon traverse the heavens yet do not circle. Thus, Heaven and Earth’s revolution and abiding arise from their non-revolution and non-abiding; the sun and moon’s coming and going arise from their non-coming and non-going. Truly, who can fathom what governs and sustains this? Who knows what is meant by a true master?

Chen Bixu’s commentary: The qi of purity and subtlety revolves without cease; the forms of heaviness and turbidity never fail to rest. The essences of water and fire mutually ascend and descend. If there were one who governed and sustained, it would be laborious; if there were a mechanism turning ceaselessly, it would be contrived.

Rain transforms through clouds, thus rain emerges from Earth; clouds unite through qi, thus clouds emerge from Heaven. The clear and turbid qi of the human body are likewise. Thus, clouds do not become rain, rain does not become clouds—the principle of mutual aid is obscure, its workings hidden. How could there be an agent?

Clouds bestow of themselves; rain indulges of itself. If there were one who urged this on, it would be partial; if there were one who breathed and scattered, it would be ruinous. The six qi—cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire—when extreme, transform. Thus they are called the Six Ultimates. The Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—when constant, transform. Thus they are called the Five Constants. When qi harmonizes, teaching is perfected; when phases clash, governance fails.

The *Nine* and *Luo* refer to the *Luo Scripture* and the *Nine Categories*—what the *Great Plan* sets forth.

When the ruler attains the *Nine Categories* of the *Great Plan*, the constant norms are rightly ordered, the Five Blessings spread, and the people submit. When the ruler loses the *Nine Categories* of the *Great Plan*, the constant norms are disordered, the Six Ultimates harm, and the people rebel. Neither submission nor rebellion—allowing things to be as they are—could this not be called the governance of the Supreme Sovereigns?

Lin’s *Jiang’s Exegesis from Yong Studio* states: The heavens move in a daily circuit—does this arise from their own motion? The earth has fourfold movement—does it remain fixed in place? The sun departs, the moon arrives, like men contending and seizing—hence it is called "strife." Their governance and maintenance all imply exertion. "Not of necessity, not of oneself"—this means it does not depend on another.

Heavenly qi descends; earthly qi ascends—thus they become clouds and rain. But who knows whether rain arises from clouds or clouds from rain? *Longshi* means "to act" or "to cease." *Yin* means "to indulge." *Le* means "play." Who would engage in such indulgent play to assist in the formation of clouds and rain? The heavens’ form leans toward the north, so winds come from the north, wandering east and west, up and down, scattering and swaying.

The question does not name a speaker—another shift in stylistic technique. The Six Ultimates are the six qi; the Five Constants are the Five Phases. All these are the principles of nature. The *Nine* and *Luo* refer to the九州 settlements—ancient texts use them interchangeably.

When the emperor-kings follow the principles of nature to govern the Nine Provinces, their achievements are complete, their virtue perfected. They illuminate the world, and all people bear them aloft—such were the men above the Three Sovereigns.

Chu’s *Superficial Observations* says: The heavens’ motion, the earth’s position, the sun’s departure, the moon’s arrival—these are known to all. Yet how they move, remain, depart, and arrive is unknown. Who governs and maintains this? Does some mechanism drive them, turning without cease? The heavens and earth are but things—the greatest in the void. Things move, yet what compels them? Men dwell between them yet do not perceive it, like ants on a millstone, unaware of their own rotation.

Do clouds arise to become rain, or does rain form from clouds? And the winds—east, west, up, down—who slackens or quickens their breath? The above are all questioning phrases, omitting the interrogator. Some consider this a variant of Zhuangzi’s style, unbound by conventional forms.

The interpretations of the Six Ultimates and Five Constants vary, but the *Great Plan*’s Six Ultimates and Five Blessings provide the proper explanation. Following them brings order; opposing them brings chaos—this is the division between rightly ordered and disordered norms. The *Nine Categories* refer to the affairs of the *Luo Scripture*. When emperor-kings act according to this principle, their governance is perfected, their virtue complete. They illuminate the Six Directions, and the world bears them aloft, achieving a people’s purity, material abundance, and the joy of great peace—none surpassed the governance of the Three Sovereigns of antiquity.

Note: This response seems unrelated to the question, yet upon examination, its intent aligns with the Way of governance. Ascending to the level of the Supreme Sovereigns means ruler and people each abide in their natural roles, human affairs fulfilled and Heaven’s principles unimpeded.

Dubi’s Annotation: Where there is benevolence, there are boundaries; thus, there is partiality and love. If partial love is called benevolence, then tigers and wolves also have partial love—why are they not benevolent? When asked about perfect benevolence, the answer is "no partiality," allowing the spontaneity of nature and destiny. Though there may be kinship, one does not recognize it as such.

The Grand Steward says: Where there is partiality, there is love; from love arises filial piety. Now, if perfect benevolence has no partiality, then there is no filial piety. Zhuangzi speaks of its root—excessive filial piety. The Grand Steward speaks of its expression—falling short.

Dark Mountain is a metaphor for the Dao, here used to illustrate filial piety, for those who die for filial piety stray far from the Dao’s root. Reverence resides in appearance; love emerges from the heart. To forget kinship is to forget one’s love and thus love all without distinction. Though one may forget kinship, kin cannot forget me—thus my filial piety still bears a flaw.

What lies within me is easily forgotten; what lies in others is difficult to transform. If one can make kin forget me but cannot also make the world forget, one remains encumbered. Only by making the world forget as well—each following the spontaneity of their nature and destiny, kinship unrecognized as kinship, love unrecognized as love—can one attain the Dao.

When the Dao is perfected to the point that virtue surpasses Yao and Shun, then non-action is achieved. Thus, benefits flow for ten thousand generations, yet the world does not know—how could this be mere sighs of praise for benevolence and filial piety? Indeed, benevolence and filial piety are not worth mentioning.

Filial piety, fraternal duty, benevolence, righteousness—these eight are all things men strive to perform, laboring their virtue. They are not the natural expression of virtue, hence the Dao’s dispersal. How could they be the most noble, the richest, the most desired?

State ranks are abolished—none are ranked, yet all remain natural. State wealth is abandoned—one discards the world like worn-out sandals. Fame and reputation are set aside—what one desires is to emulate Confucius. If so, then one abides in the Dao without change!

Detailed Annotation on the Dao: Fierce beasts do not lose their kin; stinging insects do not harm their loved ones. Thus, men’s partial love, called benevolence, is no more than this. Heaven and earth treat the myriad things as straw dogs, yet the myriad things nurture themselves. The sage treats the hundred clans as straw dogs, yet the hundred clans fulfill themselves. If one clings to traces of benevolence and love, delighting in favors and pleasures, one gains this but loses that, benefits one but neglects a hundred.

Mired in the traces of benevolence and love, one does not understand that the sage’s "non-benevolence" is the perfection of benevolence. Benevolence arises from filial piety; filial piety arises from love. From love to perfect filial piety, love is no longer worth mentioning. From filial piety to perfect benevolence, filial piety is no longer worth mentioning.

The so-called "perfection of benevolence"—how could it be merely the discourse of "surpassing filial piety" or "falling short of filial piety"? Yet the Grand Steward, taking filial piety and love as the perfection of benevolence, is deluded indeed! Traveling south from the northernmost Dark Mountain to observe, even upon reaching Deng, Dark Mountain grows ever more distant—this illustrates that the perfection of benevolence, being without partiality, cannot be spoken of in terms of filial piety and love. Once filial piety and love are established, the perfection of benevolence recedes.

The perfection of cap-wearing is not merely forgetting one’s kin, but causing one’s kin to forget oneself, thereby leaving behind the supreme virtue of Yao and Shun without acting, and forgetting the world entirely. Benefiting and nourishing all generations without awareness—this is the world forgetting oneself. In this way, benevolence is ever in surplus, and love does not arise from insufficiency. How could one merely sigh and speak of benevolence and filial piety? Sighing arises from insufficiency.

Master Bixu notes: The perfection of benevolence does not merely cherish its own kin, thus approaching impartiality—yet it is not truly without partiality. To speak of filial piety is to imply self-interest; self-interest is not the perfection of filial piety. Reverence pertains to outward form; love, to inner sincerity. Having intent makes it easy; having no mind makes it difficult. Practicing filial piety while the child takes no note is easy; providing care while the parent takes no account is difficult. Virtue extending to one household is easy; transforming the entire world is difficult. Forgetting others, forgetting transformation—this is called "total forgetting." The governance of total forgetting is the perfection of governance.

The kingly man regards sagely virtue as chaff and husks, treating the hundred clans as straw dogs, yet the practice of benevolence and filial piety never departs for even a moment—it is merely the cultivation of virtue and self-exhortation, not the seeking of recognition. The perfection of nobility: when virtue is complete, carriages and caps cannot sway the heart, thus state ranks are discarded. The perfection of wealth: when contentment is known, gold and jade cannot alter one’s resolve, thus state treasures are discarded. The perfection of aspiration: when self-sufficiency is attained, right and wrong cannot change one’s nature, thus fame and reputation are discarded. This is the unwavering adherence to the Dao.

Yongzhai observes: Tigers and wolves possess benevolence, and even bandits share something of the Dao’s intent. Though these critiques dismiss Confucian teachings, they hold their own reason. The perfection of benevolence is without partiality: to be partial yet unaware of partiality is the perfection of benevolence. "Filial piety is insufficient" does not mean one is unfilial—rather, filial piety transcends speech. The perfection of benevolence stands above filial piety, thus surpassing it. The Grand Steward’s question, however, speaks of falling short of filial piety.

Reverent filial piety still admits of progress; loving filial piety reaches mutual forgetting, extending to the forgetting of kin and the forgetting of the world—all signify that traces are inferior to no path, and having a mind is inferior to having no mind. Abandoning the virtue of Yao and Shun without acting, benefiting all generations without awareness—how could one sigh and boast of benevolence and filial piety? Filial piety and fraternal duty, even to the point of incorruptibility, are deemed fine virtues by the world, yet they are merely mutual encouragement to self-imposed hardship, not worth exalting.

What need has my perfection of nobility for state ranks? What need has my perfection of wealth for state treasures? What need has my perfection of aspiration for fame and reputation? Thus, all are cast aside—this is the unchanging adherence to the Dao, the natural course. The preceding eight are all forms of self-enslavement through action, while I remain ever without action.

Tigers and wolves, though utterly vicious, may be called benevolent for their parental affection—this is the world’s view of benevolence as partial love. Thus, the Perfected One, responding to the question, spoke in correction. The Grand Steward, doubting this was benevolence, asked about the perfection of benevolence. The answer—"the perfection of benevolence is without partiality"—how grand these words! Alas, the Grand Steward could not grasp them, ultimately reducing benevolence to partial love and further grounding benevolence in filial piety, failing to recognize the exalted nature of the perfection of benevolence. Filial piety, being insufficient to encompass it, is thus deemed "falling short." Traveling south without seeing Dark Mountain illustrates how partial love distances one from benevolence.

Reverent filial piety focuses on appearance; loving filial piety arises from the heart. Forgetting kin allows one to serve them appropriately, without difficulty. Causing kin to forget oneself removes their concerns, and action requires no further progress. Forgetting the world means transforming with it; the world forgetting oneself means transformation becomes imperceptible—like the spring wind and summer rain nurturing the myriad things without claiming credit. This is the perfection of benevolence and filial piety.

Thus, leaving behind the virtue of Yao and Shun without acting, like dust, chaff, and husks, is sufficient to mold even Yao and Shun. Benefiting all generations without awareness, one’s merit covering the world yet seeming not one’s own—how could one then sigh and speak of benevolence and filial piety? For to grasp the essence is to render words unnecessary.

The world esteems the eight virtues—filial piety, fraternal duty, incorruptibility, and purity—as fine, yet they are but self-imposed hardship! Cultivating the Dao to its perfection, one attains the perfection of nobility, wealth, and aspiration. Looking back, state ranks, treasures, and reputation are cast aside like the Dao’s non-action compared to the self-enslavement of the eight. This Dao spans ancient and present, never changing—this is why it is the perfection of nobility, wealth, and the ultimate aspiration of all.

**Heaven’s Motion (Part Two)**

Beigong Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor, saying: "When Your Majesty performed the music of *Xianchi* upon the wilds of Dongting, at first I heard it and was afraid; then I heard it again and was at ease; but when I heard it to the end, I was bewildered. Vast and silent, I could not find myself."

The Emperor said: "You were nearly so! I performed it with human affairs, harmonized it with Heaven, conducted it with ritual and righteousness, and established it upon the Great Purity. For the supreme music first responds to human matters, accords with Heaven’s principles, proceeds through the Five Virtues, and answers to nature. Only then does it regulate the four seasons and bring all things into perfect harmony.

The four seasons arise in succession, and the myriad things follow their birth. Now flourishing, now declining, their patterns of civil and martial order are constant. Now clear, now turbid, yin and yang are balanced, their sounds flowing like light. When the creatures of the earth first stir, I startle them with thunder; its end has no tail, its beginning no head. Now death, now life; now stillness, now motion—ever without limit, yet never to be awaited. This is why you were afraid.

Then I performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illumined it with the brightness of sun and moon. Its sounds could be short or long, soft or hard; transformed yet unified, unbound by fixed custom. In valleys, it filled the valleys; in pits, it filled the pits. Stopping up the senses to guard the spirit, it took things as its measure. Its tones were vast and unbounded, its name lofty and bright. Thus do ghosts and spirits keep to their hidden realms, while sun, moon, and stars follow their courses.

I halted it at the finite, yet let it flow into the infinite. You sought to ponder it but could not know it; to gaze upon it but could not see it; to pursue it but could not reach it. Suddenly you stood upon the Way of the fourfold void, leaning on a withered catalpa and chanting. You knew your desires were exhausted, your strength spent in pursuit—how could I not have surpassed you? When form fills emptiness, it becomes pliable and yielding. You yielded, and so were at ease.

Then I performed it with the sound of no-rest, attuned it to the mandate of nature. It seemed to mingle with the spontaneous growth of things, a music of the forest without form. It spread and swayed without trailing, dark and obscure yet soundless. Moving without direction, dwelling in profound obscurity—some call it death, some life; some call it substance, some glory. It flows and scatters, unbound by constant sound. The world doubts it, so they consult the sages.

The sage is one who penetrates to the truth of things and fulfills their destiny. The heavenly mechanism is not set in motion, yet the five senses are all complete—this is called the music of Heaven, which delights the heart without words. Thus the clans of old composed this ode:

*Listening, you hear no sound;
Gazing, you see no form.
Filling heaven and earth,
Enveloping the six directions.*

You wished to hear it but found no point of contact—this is why you were bewildered.

Music begins with fear, and fear gives rise to reverence. Then I followed it with weariness, and weariness leads to withdrawal. Finally, it ends in confusion, and confusion leads to foolishness. Foolishness leads to the Way. The Way can be carried and shared.

Guo’s commentary: "Not finding oneself" means sitting in forgetfulness. From this we know that supreme music is not mere sound. It first accords with Heaven, responds to man, is grasped by the heart, and suits the nature. Only then is it expressed in sound and performed in melody. Thus the music of *Xianchi* could only be completed after the transformation of the Yellow Emperor.

The natural pitch-pipes fill heaven and earth. If one follows them without seizing control, the supreme music is complete. Thus one employs their spontaneous movement, turning without limit and taking change as the constant. At first, hearing its boundless transformations, one cannot await it with singleness—hence the trembling awe. Performing it with yin and yang, illumining it with sun and moon, is to employ the Way of Heaven. Unified in transformation yet unbound by fixed custom, it fills valleys and pits without exception. Stopping up the senses to guard the spirit, the great system remains uncut. When name matches reality, it is lofty and bright. Thus ghosts and spirits do not leave their places, and sun and stars do not stray from their courses. Halted at the finite, it yet dwells at the utmost limit; flowing into the infinite, it follows change wherever it goes. Pondering it, you cannot know it; pursuing it, you cannot reach it. Darkly it lets transformations take their course, vast and boundless, leaving nothing more to be done.

The knowledge and strength of things each have their limits. When form fills emptiness, there is no self—hence one yields to nature, and the fear and awe subside. Having subsided, one attains the state beyond weariness—this is its perfection. All that the mandate encompasses is but nature. Mingled without attachment, it arises in due course. Fitting within the body, it has no separate form. Spreading without trailing, dark and obscure yet soundless—this is the supreme music. Moving without direction, dwelling in profound obscurity—this is the ultimate tranquility. Death and life, substance and glory, change with things. This shows that the sage responds to the world without initiating, so that all with feeling and destiny draw upon it.

Forgetting music, one finds music sufficient—not displayed yet fully present. Delight lies in harmony, not in words. The ode of the Flame Emperor is the music of no-music, the perfection of music.

Trembling in awe, one reveres it—this is not yet great harmony. Then comes weariness, and withdrawal begins to fade. Confusion leads to foolishness, and foolishness to the Way. To take ignorance as foolishness is to reach the utmost. Lü’s commentary: Music is the Way.

The wilds of Dongting are a vast and desolate place. Though performed by man, it is beautified by Heaven’s principles—music arises from emptiness. Conducted with ritual and righteousness, established upon the Great Purity, it dwells in the Great Beginning. The four seasons and the myriad things are nothing but music. Flourishing and declining, the civil and martial patterns cannot be disordered; clear and turbid, yin and yang are harmonized without discord in their sounds, which flow like light between heaven and earth. Yet without resonance, they do not manifest.

Seeking its root and branches, there is no head, no tail. Death and life, stillness and motion—ever without limit, yet never to be awaited. This is why you were afraid."

Here is the translation:

---

This is nothing else: I revealed it through the human, and they entered it through the human. When one enters the Heavenly through the human, the ten thousand transformations differ—how can that which is called "the One" be awaited? It is fitting that they were afraid.

Moreover, when performed through yin and yang and illuminated by the sun and moon, it is simply the Heavenly. Its short and long are not constant; it fills valleys and ravines. Guarding the spirits with the divisions of the paths, taking things as measure—this is how it becomes sound. When flourished, it is not constrained by the cosmos. When lofty and bright, it is what makes the Heavenly; ghosts and spirits guard the hidden. The stars follow their courses, their cessation has limits, their flow has no end—it is only what is shown.

Desiring to ponder it yet not knowing, pursuing it yet not reaching, eyes exhausted and strength spent, one trails behind and grows weary. This is nothing else: I revealed it through the Heavenly, and they received it through the Heavenly.

I further performed it with no weariness, attuned it to spontaneity. Mixed and pursued, medicines arise, and the ten thousand things flourish abundantly. Forest music has no form, each returning to its root. When spread and flourished without trailing, movement has no direction. In the hidden and dark, there is no sound—dwelling in profound obscurity. Death and life are truly flourishing; scattered and wandering, without constancy, it is not constrained by the one.

This is what the world doubts, yet the sage embodies it in rising, dwelling, and hasty moments, never departing from it. What is called "sage" is nothing else: penetrating to feeling, following fate, ears listening and eyes seeing—nothing is not this. It is simply their Heavenly mechanism. Why seek to expand it?

This is the Heavenly music, wordless yet delighting the heart. Thus, the odes of Youyan-shi and the subtleties of *Xianchi* are like this. If you wish to hear it, it is fitting that you have no contact and my hearing is not employed—hence the confusion.

This is nothing else: forgetting the human, forgetting the Heavenly. First, fear gives rise to spirits; next, weariness gives rise to escape; finally, confusion gives rise to foolishness. The reason the body cannot bear the Way is its bright knowledge and perception. Only by discarding knowledge and becoming foolish can one bear the Way and unite with it.

*Yidu’s Commentary*: When the ancients spoke of the utmost music, was it merely the ends of bells, drums, pipes, strings, and measures? Its principle extends beyond the bounds of Heaven and Earth; its feeling flows through the subtleties of yin and yang. No form can be seen, no sound can be heard—what the *Rites* calls "music dwelling in the Great Beginning," what Laozi calls "the great sound is rare of voice."

First performed through the human, it has not yet departed from the human. Next performed through yin and yang—this is the Heavenly. Finally, it reaches the spiritual, where life and death cannot be fathomed, so it is attuned to the mandate of spontaneity. The human Dao is thus enacted with ritual and righteousness; the Heavenly Dao is illuminated by the sun and moon. "No weariness" is the spiritual—spirits command yin and yang, govern the sun and moon, and encompass ritual and righteousness. What the *Changes* calls "yin and yang unfathomable" is this.

When the Way reaches formlessness, people doubt it; doubt gives rise to confusion, confusion to foolishness, foolishness to the Way—this is what is meant.

*Xiang Dao’s Commentary*: First performed through the human and enacted with ritual and righteousness, refined by the Heavenly and established upon the Great Purity, its skill is seen in endless transformations—thus, hearing it inspires fear. Fear causes the spirit to depart, hence spirits arise. In the middle, performed through the harmony of yin and yang and illuminated by the brightness of the sun and moon, its function lies in the unfathomable flow and cessation—thus, hearing it induces weariness. Weariness causes the body to slacken and hearing to dull, hence escape. Finally, performed with the sound of no weariness and attuned to the mandate of spontaneity, its ultimate aim is the formless and soundless profound obscurity—thus, hearing it brings confusion. Confusion leads to abandoning knowledge as if benighted, hence foolishness. Rampant and reckless, yet treading the great square; unknowing and unperceiving, yet following the Heavenly pattern—this is called "foolishness giving rise to the Way."

*Bixu’s Commentary*: The music of great refinement is bland and does not enter the ear. First hearing it inspires fear—it is not what the vulgar find beautiful. Listening carefully, one grows weary; in the end, one is confused. Vast and silent, none know why. Performed through the human, it harmonizes and enlivens the myriad things; refined by the Heavenly, it blends beautifully with spontaneity. Enacted with ritual and righteousness, high and low do not transgress. Established upon the Great Purity, it sweeps clean the realm. The four seasons arise in turn and follow order; the ten thousand things follow their generation without opposition. Civil and martial principles are constant; yin and yang’s qi flows smoothly. Its sound is radiant light, its primal harmony universally responsive.

Empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever arising—how could it have an end? When yin and yang harmonize, ruler and minister unite in virtue; when the sun and moon shine, treacherous flatterers cannot advance. Thus, the governance of the Dao renews daily, transformation knows no stagnation. Ghosts have no numinous echoes; laws and commands do not err. To ponder and know is not wondrous; to gaze and see is not obscure; to pursue and reach is not dark. Standing alone in transformation without escape—this is why it is inexhaustible and unconstrained.

Vast and congealed, it is without compliance and weariness; when utmost harmony rests, there is no weariness. The utmost music is spontaneous, like the sound of thickets and tall bamboo—all are the Heavenly pipes. Who is the one who rages? The nature of things is serene; when spread and flourished, it does not trail. The true wind is tranquil; in the hidden and dark, there is no sound. The primordial qi is mixed and complete—thus, it moves without direction. The great image has no form—thus, it dwells in profound obscurity.

Seeing it now moving, now still, now grasping, now gathering, now flourishing—one calls it "life and death, truly flourishing." Following the qi’s waxing and waning, responding to the seasons in change, one doubts its constancy. Thus, examining the sagely laws, one penetrates the feelings of ghosts and spirits and follows the fates of the ten thousand things. Still as dead ashes, the mechanism ceases; the Five Phases move on their own, and the offices are complete.

The *Odes of Yan-shi* are ancient musical compositions—formless and unseen, soundless and unheard. With no means for sight or hearing, how could one not be confused? Fear in the heart brings misfortune; weariness in the spirit leads to concealment; confusion in the mind leads to foolishness. Foolishness is near the Way.

Yongzhai states: Performance proceeds from human affairs; its harmony arises from heavenly principle, ritual propriety—all is ordered and patterned. The Great Purity accords with the workings of creation. From this point onward, the music speaks of transformations startling and stirring, at once delightful and astonishing, flowing and radiant, without discernible beginning or end. Both constant and ever-changing, one seeks its unifying ground yet finds it unattainable—hence the fear. Yin and yang, sun and moon likewise convey this sense of harmonious radiance. Transformations are ceaseless, ever more wondrous in their emergence.

Obstruct the ears and eyes and guard with spirit; follow things and equalize their measures. Ghosts and spirits dwell in darkness; sun and stars follow their courses—all speak of relying not on cunning knowledge but on following nature. It halts at what is bounded, eludes pursuit, and takes form as though something yet is not something—thus one wishes to perceive it yet cannot exhaust it, wishes to pursue it yet cannot overtake it. Though the form is full, the self is forgotten as if empty. Utterly yielding and unrestrained, this is what leads to weariness. Without weariness, there is no cessation.

*Ming* is akin to principle. Intermingling and chasing one another, like the myriad things growing thickly, luxuriant in joy, spreading and swaying—not by pulling or dragging—dim and obscure yet inaudible, shifting and moving without fixed direction: thus life and death are truly flourishing, scattering and wandering without constancy. This is what the people of the world doubt, and so they examine it through the sages. Penetrating feelings and fulfilling fate, they reach the utmost of nature.

Though eyes, hands, and feet are all present, sight, hearing, and movement are all beyond self-awareness—this is called the joy of Heaven. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: "Reversing the flow to perfect unity, the six senses cease to function"—such is the state. At this moment, though you may wish to listen, there is nothing to grasp, hence the confusion.

Yan’s four-line verse merely elaborates the preceding idea with a turn, forming a rhythmic cadence—such is the subtlety of this textual art. Earlier, fear, weariness, and confusion were mentioned, but their meaning was not yet clear; only at the conclusion is it revealed that foolishness can lead one into the Dao. It is said that one must traverse such realms to progress: weariness gives way to retreat, marking the moment when desire outstrips ability; confusion gives way to foolishness, the time when consciousness and perception are both forgotten.

In the *Nanhua*, the Dao is discussed through the example of the Yellow Emperor performing music in the wilds of Dongting, for nothing transforms things as swiftly as the Dao, and nothing moves people as deeply as music. Yet to seek the ultimate sound in the vast silence, one must be devoted to the Dao. When people first hear the Dao, their hearts are in turmoil—this is the beginning of fear. Soon, the struggle subsides, and weariness sets in. As emotions and perceptions gradually fade, fear and weariness dissolve, and one attains harmony and joy, returning to a state of unknowing—this is the sequence of entering the Dao.

I have privately examined the meaning of the three performances in this chapter, comparing them to the three winds in the *Qiwulun*. The first performance, with human agency, proceeds through ritual and propriety, beginning with deliberate action. The second, guided by Heaven, is established in the Great Purity, drawing closer to spontaneity. The four seasons alternate, the myriad things follow their growth, yin and yang harmonize, and their sounds flow like light—yet they do not depart from the patterns of civil and martial governance, prosperity and decline, purity and turbidity. This is the first performance, corresponding to the human wind.

The second performance harmonizes yin and yang, illuminated by the brightness of sun and moon. Its sounds may be short or long, soft or firm, filling valleys and ravines, measured by things themselves—this is the earth wind. The final performance is the sound of non-weariness, attuned to the mandate of spontaneity, filling the cosmos and embracing the six directions, following Heaven’s ceaseless and unbroken movement.

At this stage, one fulfills emotions and follows fate, seeing and hearing not through the ears and eyes. Though neither form nor sound, all forms and sounds abide in the wonder of the Heavenly wind. Thus, the intermingling and thriving growth of the myriad things, the roaring of ten thousand apertures—joy in the forest yet without form, the very cause of the roaring, sought yet unattainable. Spreading and swaying without pulling or dragging, like a fierce wind crossing the sea. Dim and obscure, without sound, as if the apertures were empty. Moving without fixed direction, dwelling in profound obscurity, one enters the unfathomable spirit. Thus, life and death truly flourish, scattering and wandering without constancy—this is what most people doubt, yet what the sages investigate.

The heavenly mechanism is not activated; the body is cast aside, and the senses are abandoned. Though the five senses are all present, they are preserved yet unused. To reach a state of wordless heart-joy—what is this if not the joy of Heaven? As the *Rites* says: "Great music harmonizes with Heaven and Earth." There is no one whose nature does not attain the Dao through harmony and joy. When joy reaches harmony, Heaven and Earth respond—this is not something humans can accomplish alone. Thus, this chapter uses music as a metaphor for the Dao, teaching scholars that when form and qi harmonize, the ultimate sound flows unimpeded without audible harmony, and this does not depend on the elaborate performances of metal, stone, silk, or bamboo.

At the end, Yan’s verse is cited to illuminate the ultimate Dao. The ultimate sound cannot be grasped by sight or hearing, hence the final confusion. Confusion leads to foolishness—this is the foolishness of Yanzi, which cannot be surpassed. Sight, hearing, and knowledge are all at once extinguished, so the Dao can be carried and journeyed with.

This music is not of ordinary craftsmanship; its sounds are inherent in the primordial. Utmost joy and harmony fill Heaven and Earth, beyond the reach of strings and bamboo. Day and night, it is ever-present, startling even the blind Kuang and making the clay figurines sing and the wooden puppets dance. How could the wonder of the *Xianchi* lie in mere sounds or musical measures?

The true listener does not rely on the ears but on the heart, not on the heart but on qi, uniting emptiness with emptiness, hearing in the realm of no-hearing. What is enjoyed is Heaven, and the joy is complete. As the *Taishang* says: "Music and food are but passing enticements to travelers." Beneath the depths, there must be those who hear the thunder and act—I shall discuss music with them.

*Taihe* should be *Taihe* (Great Harmony). *Tangran* should be *changran* (the appearance of being lost in thought). *Zhongshi* in another version is written as *Yan*, pronounced *biyao*, the name of a primordial, non-acting sovereign.

Confucius traveled west to Wei. Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin: "What do you think of the Master’s conduct?" Shi Jin replied: "Alas, your Master is in dire straits!" Yan Yuan asked: "Why?" Shi Jin said: "Before the straw dogs are displayed, they are reverently placed in fine baskets, wrapped in embroidered cloth, and the officiant fasts to present them. Once displayed, passersby trample their heads and spines, and fuel-gatherers take them to burn. If one were to gather them again, place them in fine baskets, wrap them in embroidered cloth, and wander or rest beneath them, they would not dream—indeed, they would surely curse frequently.

Now your Master has taken the already-displayed straw dogs of the former kings, gathering disciples to wander and rest beneath them. Thus, he was assaulted while felling a tree in Song, had his borders reduced in Wei, was impoverished in Shang and Zhou—is this not his dream? Besieged between Chen and Cai, he went seven days without cooking a meal, with death and life as neighbors—is this not his curse?

On water, nothing surpasses a boat; on land, nothing surpasses a cart. Just as a boat can travel on water, to seek to push it on land is to exhaust oneself without making even a short distance."

Are not past and present like water and land? Were not Zhou and Lu like boat and cart? Now to carry Zhou’s firewood to Lu is like pushing a boat on land—laborious yet fruitless, and one’s person will surely meet with misfortune. He did not understand the transmission of the boundless, which responds to things without exhaustion.

Have you alone not seen the well-sweep? Pulled, it bows; released, it rises. It is drawn by men, not drawing men, and thus bows and rises without offending anyone. Therefore, the rites, righteousness, laws, and institutions of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors did not pride themselves on uniformity but on governance. Thus, the rites, righteousness, laws, and institutions of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors were like the wild pear, the pear, the orange, and the pomelo—their flavors differ yet all are pleasing to the mouth. Therefore, rites, righteousness, laws, and institutions are what change with the times.

Now if one were to take a macaque and clothe it in the robes of the Duke of Zhou, it would gnaw and tear them to shreds, casting them off entirely before being satisfied. To observe the difference between past and present is like the difference between a macaque and the Duke of Zhou. Thus, when Xishi was afflicted with heart pain and knit her brows in her village, the ugly women of her village saw and admired it, returning home to clutch their hearts and knit their brows as well. The rich of her village, seeing this, firmly shut their doors and refused to come out; the poor, seeing it, took their wives and children and fled. They knew the beauty of knitting brows but did not know why it was beautiful.

Alas, how your Master has come to such straits! As Guo’s commentary says: All discarded things, useless in their time, invite other calamities. The canonical rites of the former kings were meant to suit their time and use; when their time has passed and they are not abandoned, they give rise to the beginnings of forced imitation. Thus, as times change and generations differ, rites should also change, following things without attachment, achieving success without labor, aiming only to accord with the times and respond to the needs of governance. What one deems beautiful, another may deem ugly. Rites and righteousness, when timely and in use, are like Xishi; when their time has passed and they are not abandoned, they are like the ugly woman.

As Lü’s commentary says: The rites, righteousness, laws, and institutions of the sages are all traces that respond to their age. When they respond to their age, they are revered and adorned—like the straw dogs not yet displayed, purified and presented with solemnity. But when their time has passed, they are discarded and abandoned—like the straw dogs already displayed, trampled by passersby. To take the already-displayed straw dogs and rest beneath them is to bind the heart, and one will not dream but surely curse. To take the former kings’ traces that responded to their age and, with disciples, ceaselessly chant and lecture on them is to invite the dream of felling trees in Song, having borders reduced in Wei, impoverishment in Shang and Zhou, and the curse of being besieged between Chen and Cai, with death and life as neighbors—this is the recompense. Only by being unable to let go and move on, binding the heart, does one find boats and carts unsuitable, Zhou and Lu impassable.

Not understanding the transmission of the boundless, which responds to things without exhaustion, one governs men in vain. The well-sweep’s bowing and rising without offense is not how one responds to change. The wild pear and pear’s differing flavors, both pleasing to the mouth, are like clothing a macaque in the Duke of Zhou’s robes—one knows the beauty of knitting brows but not why it is beautiful. To establish teachings and set forth the Dao without attachment, even if Confucius took the former kings’ traces that responded to their age and chanted and lectured on them, how could he have been bound? To see the felling of trees, the reduction of borders, the straits of Shang and Zhou, the peril of Chen and Cai, is like the passing of swallows, sparrows, painted insects before one’s eyes!

The Dao’s not being practiced—I know this well! Why then insist on boats and carts being used, Zhou and Lu being followed, not understanding the transmission of the boundless, and thus bowing and rising to offend, not knowing that rites, righteousness, laws, and institutions change with the times, or why knitting brows is beautiful? To study Confucius without knowing how to be Confucius is to fall into such folly. This is why Zhuangzi speaks of it repeatedly.

As Du’s commentary says: The *Six Classics* are the former kings’ discarded traces. When fitting, they are used; when past, they are abandoned—like straw dogs not yet displayed, placed in fine baskets, but once displayed, trampled and burned. If one were to take them again and rest beneath them, one would not dream but surely curse, for the remnants of sacrifices to ghosts and spirits may invite other calamities. Shi Jin conveyed this meaning to Yan Yuan: Now your Master is deluded by the ancient men of clay and their discarded traces, seeking to act in his time, making disciples wander and rest beneath benevolence, righteousness, rites, and music, and thus he cannot avoid the world’s ridicule and censure. This is like pushing a boat on land or driving a cart on water.

One who responds to things without exhaustion follows the times and adapts to change, without past or present—this is the transmission of the boundless. Again, the well-sweep bows and rises as men pull it, not pulling men—now does Confucius exert himself in benevolence, righteousness, rites, and music to compel the world to follow him, unlike the well-sweep? Thus, the former kings’ laws and institutions are like the differing flavors of many fruits, all pleasing to the mouth, but only when they change with the times do they all fit. Clothing a macaque in the Duke of Zhou’s robes illustrates the incompatibility of past and present. Rites, righteousness, laws, and institutions are one, but the times in which they are used differ, just as the knitting of brows by Xishi and the village woman is one, yet beauty and ugliness differ.

As the detailed commentary on the Dao says: The songs of Qi, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in melody yet all bring joy; the wails of the Nine Yi and Eight Man differ in sound yet all bring sorrow. Thus, the sage’s governance of the world rides the times to establish what is fitting, follows the people to set forth laws. If a fruit can benefit the state, its uses are not uniform; if a practice can facilitate affairs, its rites are not the same. Thus, Fuxi and Shennong taught without punishing; the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun punished without anger. The Xia was plain without ornament; the Zhou was ornate without plainness. Can the laws of antiquity be practiced today? Can today’s laws be rigidly adhered to antiquity? Confucius applied the ancient to govern the present—he did not rigidly adhere to it.

Seeking to follow the traces in order to return to that which underlies the traces is but an empty endeavor. Master Jin feared that the world’s people would drown in the ills of clinging to the near, and so he began by comparing them to straw dogs and boats-and-carts, then to well-sweeps and bitter-orange branches, and finally to gibbons and ugliness-and-beauty—just as the ways of Zhou and Lu in ancient and modern times cannot be made one. His diagnosis declared: Those who govern by studying books do not fully grasp the nature of the horse; those who model the present on antiquity do not comprehend the changes of affairs.

Master Bixu’s commentary: Master Jin pitied Confucius for possessing talent yet lacking insight—like a straw dog already discarded, to reuse it would surely invite misfortune. For governance prizes daily renewal; treading in traces leads only to harm. If the Way of Zhou could be practiced in Lu, then the Taihang Mountains could be navigated by boat. Better to abandon stale traces and follow nature, responding to Heaven’s principles and adapting to the transformations of things. Thus, the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors did not pride themselves on uniformity but on order—order itself became the model.

It is like the mouth’s relation to flavors: if one desires sweetness, then sweetness; if one desires pungency, then pungency—responding to the times and changing accordingly. Thus, to follow the gibbon’s nature is to tame it easily; to mimic Xi Shi’s frown only makes one uglier.

Master Yongzhai observed: Master Jin belonged to the same lineage as the Old Man Carrying Reeds and Jie Yu, the Madman of Chu—all implying that what the Confucians study are but the stale words of antiquity, useless in the present age. The metaphors of boats and carts on land and water speak to the difference of times. The transmission of the boundless Way does not cling to a single path; the ancient teachings adapt to the times without fixity, thus responding to the world without end. Moving with others without attachment to the self—this is the metaphor of responding to things without fixed direction.

The sourness of wild pears and the bitterness of orange branches differ in taste, just as the Three Kings differed in rites and the Five Emperors differed in music. To force the people of today to practice the rites and music of antiquity is like clothing a gibbon in the robes of the Duke of Zhou; for the people of today to imitate the ancients is like a village woman aping Xi Shi’s frown.

This passage presents six metaphors, each more striking than the last. Straw dogs are meant to convey reverence, yet if preserved after the sacrifice, they breed calamity. Laws and standards are meant to suit the times, yet clinging to traces after the moment has passed brings only harm. This is why Master Jin mocked Confucius and sought to awaken him from his obsessions with Shang and Zhou, to free him from the snares of Chen and Cai. Yet still he hurried about, hoping to revive antiquity in the present and practice Zhou in Lu—no different from poling a boat in search of the benefits of fording a river. No wonder his responses to things repeatedly failed, bringing him to the brink where life and death stood side by side.

If only he could have been like the well-sweep, rising and falling without intent, or the orange branch, sweet or sour to the taste—why then insist on clothing the gibbon in the Duke of Zhou’s robes or prizing the village woman for Xi Shi’s beauty? The transmission of the boundless Way means that the ancient teachings hold no fixed method; it is for those who govern to adapt to the times and enact policies that suit the people.

As the *Book of Changes* says: When at an impasse, change; through change, there is passage. Does this not describe Master Jin? "Taking disciples" refers to gathering them.

"Mī" is pronounced like "mǐ," referring to a disorder where something enters the eye. This interpretation does not apply here. Lu Deming’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* records Sima Biao’s gloss: "to be oppressed," pronounced *yǎn* (一琰切). Master Cheng’s *Commentary* directly writes it as "魇" (*yǎn*), meaning a nightmare or spectral disturbance—his explanation is apt.

*Southern Florescence: True Classic of the Vast Ocean of Meaning

Those who cling to power cannot share its handle with others. Grasping it, they tremble; releasing it, they grieve—yet they discern nothing, fixated only on what never ceases. Such are the people Heaven condemns.

Resentment and favor, taking and giving, admonition and instruction, life and death—these eight are the instruments of rectification. Only those who follow great transformations without obstruction can wield them rightly. Thus it is said: rectification is rectitude itself. Those whose hearts deem otherwise find the Gate of Heaven barred.

Guo’s annotation: Seeking it in the measures of yin and yang yields no attainment—this illustrates the meaning of "absolute learning" through Confucius and Laozi. Without the inner substance to receive the Dao, even hearing it, one lets it pass. Without an inner master, external things cannot rectify the self, and thus one never achieves penetration. What issues from within is the Dao of the sage; only when there is one outside capable of receiving it does it emerge. What enters from without is learning that completes one’s nature. Though nature may be perfected through learning, one must inherently possess its substance. Without an inner master, there is no vessel to contain the sagely Dao.

Names are what the world shares in common. To embellish beyond reality is to take excessively—excessive taking throws the world into chaos. Benevolence and righteousness are the nature of man, yet human nature changes, differing between ancient and modern times. Thus, to wander and pass through is to remain obscure; to cling to one corner is to become visible. Visibility breeds pretense and invites reproach. Therefore, the utmost is to adapt to the times without fixed advancement. Following simplicity, one is easily nourished. Not depleting oneself for the sake of things, wandering freely and yielding to them—this is true reaping. To reap the true is to render one’s countenance unfeigned.

There are those in the world who burden themselves with what they reject, yet perish for what they affirm—not standing in the garden of "no lending." Those who grieve when relinquishing power cannot but tremble when grasping it. Knowing advancement but not cessation, one forfeits one’s nature and life—this is the reason for condemnation. Clinging to the old without change is to lose rectitude.

Lü’s annotation: The Dao generates the One, the One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three—yet the Dao is not the One, Two, or Three. Seeking it in measures and numbers does not transcend their bounds, hence five years yield no attainment. The Dao divides into yin and yang, yet the Dao is not yin and yang. Seeking it in yin and yang does not surpass the vastness of Heaven’s expanse, hence twelve years yield no attainment.

The Dao cannot be offered to one’s kin or imparted to one’s brothers and descendants because there is no inner master and no external rectitude. Without an inner master, I may wish to transmit it, yet the other does not abide. Without external rectitude, the other may wish to receive it, yet I do not enact it. That things have a master is inherent to them; the Dao within oneself is simply what is inherently one’s own. To possess what one does not inherently possess is to lack an inner master and not abide. The archer’s target is what receives the arrow. The Dao in relation to man is simply what he receives—imposing it where it is not received is to lack external rectitude and not enact it.

What issues from within is not received from without; the sage does not emerge, for there is no rectitude. What enters from without has no master within; the sage does not conceal it, for it does not abide. Not concealing it means one cannot extend and admit it—thus the Dao cannot be sought in measures, yin and yang, but only within oneself. It cannot be offered to ruler or kin, but only self-attained.

Names cannot be taken excessively; excessive taking dissipates virtue. Benevolence and righteousness cannot be dwelt in long; long dwelling breeds attachment and reproach. Wandering freely, one is without constraint; following simplicity, one’s needs are easily met; not lending, one does not engage with things. Thus, all one reaps is true. Inability to yield emolument stems from knowing only wealth; inability to yield fame stems from knowing only prominence; inability to share power stems from knowing only authority. Those who cling to power are ensnared by grasping and relinquishing, harming their nature most grievously—discerning nothing, they mistake muddy water for a clear abyss. Without cessation, Heaven’s punishment is inescapable.

Resentment and favor, taking and giving, admonition and instruction, life and death—these eight are the instruments of rectification, not the Dao of rectification. Only by following great transformations without obstruction can one rightly employ these instruments. Employing the instruments through the Dao—this is why rectification is rectitude. The Gate of Heaven is the path by which those who follow great transformations without obstruction enter and exit. To deem otherwise is to know the Gate of Heaven remains barred.

Yi Du’s annotation: The Dao’s subtlety lies beyond yin and yang; its grossness resides within measures and numbers. Seeking it here yields no attainment—only through non-thought and non-seeking is it attained beyond yin and yang. It cannot be presented to superiors nor imparted to inferiors—there is no other reason: learning without reflection is delusion; reflection without learning is peril. Reflection is how one honors virtue; learning is how one pursues inquiry. "No inner master" means one cannot reflect. "No external rectitude" means one cannot learn.

What enters from without is learning. Without an inner master to reflect on it, what enters from without does not abide in the heart. What issues from within is reflection. Without learning to rectify it externally, what issues from within does not manifest in the human Dao. What issues from within, not being received externally, does not abide. The sage does not emerge. Learning that enters from without, without a master within, cannot reflect—the sage does not conceal, for emergence and concealment are matters of display and hiding.

The *Book of Changes* states: "Radiance renews daily"—this is virtue issuing from within. The noble person extensively studies past words and deeds—this is what enters from without. What issues from within extends vastness; what enters from without exhausts subtlety. This is how the Dao is preserved whole.

Names are the world’s public instrument.

If there is partiality, then it is an insubstantial name—one must not take it excessively. Benevolence and righteousness in relation to the Dao are like inns along a road: one may stay a single night, but cannot dwell there long. This means one should not cling too closely to benevolence and righteousness.

Free and unfettered, one acts without contrivance. Without lending, there is no expenditure. The wandering in pursuit of the true is the wandering of Heaven itself.

Those who crave wealth and power have dull and benighted minds, unable to perceive the profound principle. They rush headlong into ceaseless toil—these are the people Heaven punishes. Resentment and gratitude, life and death—these eight are instruments only the great person may rightly employ.

The Gate of Heaven is where the spirit comes and goes, now opening, now closing. All things emerge and enter here, and its transformations are inexhaustible.

The *Detailed Annotations on the Dao* states: Zhuangzi records that Confucius, at fifty-one, had yet to hear the Dao, using myriad words to show how difficult it is to encounter.

Measures and numbers do not exceed five; yin and yang do not exceed twelve. Benevolence establishes others, so one borrows the Way to act. Righteousness establishes oneself, so one lodges temporarily to dwell. Yet borrowing the Way to act does not mean one does not lodge—Mencius speaks of seven as the secure dwelling and the vast abode. Lodging temporarily to dwell does not mean one does not act—Mencius speaks of righteousness as the correct path and the great Way.

To lend is to supply another’s lack, only to be repaid in the end. Fields are where one labors to cultivate and nourish. Those who eat from simple, unadorned fields find their food sweet. Those who stand in gardens that do not lend find their lending good and complete.

The *Blue Void Commentary* states: Confucius understood the use of what is useful but had not attained the Dao of non-action. The Dao is a thing without threads or hairs to measure, without the smallest fraction to calculate, without branches or stems to trace. Thus, seeking it, one does not obtain it.

Laozi taught that the Dao is such a thing that even ruler and minister, parent and child, cannot transmit it—its vessel is difficult to find. Without an inner source, auspiciousness does not abide. Without external rectification, the highest virtue does not flow.

Subtle meaning arises from the sage’s heart, but without an external vessel to receive the Dao, though the subtle meaning is clear, it does not emerge. Profound words enter the learner’s ears, but without inner capacity to contain them, the listener, though enlightened, remains confused—how could the profound words ever be concealed?

Names are the guests of reality; taking too many invites calamity. Benevolence and righteousness are not fixed laws—how can waystations be places of secure dwelling? The perfected of old borrowed them to act, lodged in them temporarily, wandered in the realm of self-attainment, roamed the vast and boundless wilds, and though their walls adjoined, they did not visit one another—this is called the wandering in pursuit of the true. In truth, there is no falsity.

Those who flaunt wealth fear losing emolument; those who boast of glory cherish their names; those who rely on power harbor many suspicions—such are the common ways of the world. With discernment, one knows when to stop; knowing when to stop, one avoids disgrace.

Resentment and gratitude, life and death—these eight are bound to names and realities. When names accord with realities, instruments are not misused. To resist change is to obstruct; obstruction causes names and realities to falter. When names are correct, realities are correct. To force them is to block the numinous chamber.

*Yongzhai* says: Measures and numbers are rites and music; yin and yang are the principles of things. Five years and twelve years have no special meaning—they only speak of seeking coarsely and finely for a long time without attainment.

From “If the Dao could be silently transmitted” onward, these four lines are exquisitely expressed. Though one who studies the Dao may hear something from without, if there is no master within, it is not one’s own attainment and cannot be retained. Without external rectification, I have nothing to gain, and thus no external rectification—how can it act on its own?

“What issues from within” refers to teaching others: my words issue from within, but if you cannot receive them, the sage will not instruct you. “What enters from without” refers to receiving teaching: profound words enter your ears from without, but if you have no insight and no inner master, though you hear, you gain nothing—it is not that the sage conceals anything.

These four lines are most subtle. The Dao cannot be transmitted—the problem lies entirely in these four lines. One must not take names excessively—this is a rebuke to the Confucians’ love of fame. One must not dwell long in benevolence and righteousness, for they have crossroads.

To observe is to see. Where there is sound, it can also be seen—this is how calamity arises. Borrowing the Way and lodging temporarily carry the meaning of transformation when exceeded.

Simplicity, not lending, ease of nourishment without expenditure—these cost nothing of oneself. This is called gathering the true principle. Wealth, fame, and power—grasping them brings fear of loss; clinging to them brings sorrow from infatuation. Seeing nothing, one gazes at what never rests—bewildered and unable to return.

With no insight in the heart and no ability to turn and see one’s confusion, Heaven has stripped away one’s spirit. Resentment and gratitude, and the other six, exist in this human world, and thus these eight are employed. To employ what should be employed is called correctness—only those without intent can rightly use them.

Great change is creation and transformation. If one can follow it without obstruction, then what is within me is correct, and I can correct things. If one cannot be without intent and takes this as incorrect, then the Heaven within one’s breast is darkened and obstructed.

The *Book of Songs* says: “Heaven guides the people”—this is the meaning of the Gate of Heaven. The study of measures and numbers can be examined through pitch pipes and calendars. The study of yin and yang can be deduced through climate and seasons. But the essence of the Dao is not bound to pitch pipes or calendars, nor does it involve climate or seasons. Thus, seeking it in these ways, one does not obtain it. Only those without intent who follow transformation do not seek to conform yet conform—it cannot be obtained through seeking.

If the Dao could be offered, there would be none who would not transmit it to their children and grandchildren. This means the Dao cannot be transmitted with intent or obtained through private desire.

Without an inner source, there is no substance within, so the Dao does not flow. Without external rectification, the highest virtue does not act. It is like the people of Ying in the world without master craftsmen—thus, the Dao does not abide.

Without external rectification by a true master, if the inner core remains steadfast, and the outer form is properly aligned, one can achieve wondrous discernment. How much more so, then, the subtlety of transmitting and receiving the supreme Dao—where spirit communes and hearts resonate in the realm of the indistinct and obscure?

The sage awakens the people through the Dao, like heaven bestowing sweet dew, never choosing where it falls. Yet without vessels of jade and fine stone, it cannot be contained. This is what it means to lack receptivity without and no inner source within.

Fame, when excessively pursued, invites ruin and harm. Benevolence and righteousness, when clung to for long, breed demands and reproach. The perfected person borrows them without attachment, thus worldly cares and anxieties never reach them. Through carefree wandering, they act without contrivance; through simplicity, they are easily nurtured; through non-attachment, they have no loss. Even if things crowd before them, what concern is there? This is called the wandering of gathering truth—where not a trace of private falsity is permitted, like heaven’s movement, arising from spontaneity, ceaselessly generating and transforming. This is why the person is noble and the Dao is divine.

Yet the world values only wealth, prominence, and power, unable to relinquish them, clutching tightly with fear and sorrow—when will they ever know carefree wandering again? This is called ceaseless toil, seeing nothing to illuminate it, an inescapable heavenly punishment.

The eight afflictions—resentment and gratitude among them—are tools of rectitude. Only through rectitude can one use them without misstep. Even joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—though the sage cannot wholly eliminate them—lie in moderation.

Following great change without obstruction means wealth and honor do not corrupt, poverty and lowliness do not sway, might and force do not bend. Only when the self is rectified can tools be rectified; only then can things be set right. If one’s heart deems otherwise, the great vessel is not empty—how can the Dao be discussed?

The "Gate of Heaven" is a metaphor for the emptiness of the heart. The mind’s dharma is like the eye—how could it tolerate any obstruction? Confucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Lao Dan replied: "When chaff gets in the eye, heaven and earth, the four directions, seem to shift. When mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, one cannot sleep all night. Benevolence and righteousness, so intrusive, agitate the heart—no greater disorder exists. If you, sir, could let the world not lose its uncarved simplicity, you too would move with the wind and stand by virtue—why must you clamor like one beating a drum to seek a lost child?

The egret does not bathe daily to be white, nor the crow blacken itself to be black. The natural black and white of their essence need no distinction; the spectacle of fame and reputation cannot broaden them. When a spring dries up, fish gather on land, wetting each other with their breath, moistening each other with foam—yet this is not as good as forgetting each other in rivers and lakes."

When Confucius returned from seeing Lao Dan, he did not speak for three days. His disciples asked: "Master, when you saw Lao Dan, what advice did you give?" Confucius said: "Now, in this moment, I have seen the dragon! It coalesces into form, disperses into pattern, rides the clouds and qi, and nourishes itself in yin and yang. My mouth gapes, yet I cannot speak—what advice could I give Lao Dan?"

Guo’s commentary: External things, though small, greatly harm one’s nature. If the world does not lose its uncarved simplicity, its essence remains whole, and benevolence and righteousness naturally manifest. Moving with the wind, standing by virtue—this is the Way of easy adherence and practice. To brandish benevolence and righteousness in pursuit of the Dao’s domain is like beating a drum to seek a runaway—it cannot be attained. The egret’s whiteness and the crow’s blackness are naturally sufficient, with no partiality. Thus, the most complete forget fame and reputation; only by forgetting fame and reputation can one be truly broad.

The praise of benevolence and righteousness arises from insufficiency. Like fish forgetting each other in rivers and lakes, one forgets benevolence and thus embodies benevolence. Confucius said, "Now, in this moment, I have seen the dragon," meaning Lao Dan could transform and ride without constraint, naturally complete.

Lü’s commentary: The heart of the perfected person is like a mirror. Yet benevolence and righteousness, so intrusive, disturb it—are they not like chaff in the eye or mosquitoes biting the skin? The world all possesses the uncarved simplicity of the nameless. If one can keep it from being lost, one moves with the wind and stands by virtue—why must one clamor like beating a drum to seek a lost child? The world has already lost its uncarved simplicity, and to save it with benevolence and righteousness is no different from beating a drum to seek the lost—seeking it through fame and reputation.

Moreover, the egret’s whiteness and the crow’s blackness are the natural essence—what adornment is needed? Thus, the spectacle of praise cannot broaden human nature, just as they cannot. Fish on land, wetting each other with foam, though momentarily intimate, have already lost the principle of their nature—better to forget each other in rivers and lakes. The vulgar, clinging to benevolence and righteousness, share only fleeting affection while losing the principle of their nature—better to forget each other in the rivers and lakes of the Dao’s protection.

The dragon coalesces into form and disperses into pattern, never burdening its body. Lao Dan saw benevolence and righteousness as chaff and mosquitoes—thus, it is clear he was not burdened by them.

Du’s commentary: The uncarved is the wholeness of the Dao. Benevolence and righteousness are its dispersion. The wind is the Dao’s transformation of things. Virtue is the Dao within people. If the world does not lose the wholeness of the Dao, one should simply let it be, moving with the wind, standing by virtue—why must one brandish benevolence and righteousness to seek the Dao, like beating a drum to seek the lost? The egret’s whiteness and the crow’s blackness are naturally so—thus, they need no distinction. Fame and reputation serve to describe and judge, yet they distort the uncarved simplicity—thus, they cannot broaden it.

Fish on land, wetting each other with foam, though momentarily intimate, have already lost the principle of their nature—better to forget each other in rivers and lakes, each self-sufficient. The vulgar, clinging to benevolence and righteousness, share only fleeting affection while losing the principle of their nature—better to forget each other in the rivers and lakes of the Dao’s protection, each self-sufficient.

In ancient times, people lived to old age and death without mutual visitation—how much more does this exemplify the principle! When Confucius heard the words of Lao Dan, their transformations were inexhaustible, and he sighed that they were like the dragon, coalescing and dispersing without constancy. The mouth cannot even govern itself—how could one presume to regulate Lao Dan?

*Bi Xu’s commentary:* Those who cleave to benevolence and righteousness are like chaff lodged in the eye. Those who branch into cleverness and discernment are like mosquitoes and gnats feasting on the skin—how could they not stir confusion and disorder? Uncarved and unpolished, simplicity remains whole; emulate the pure wind to transform things, and embrace utmost virtue to attain self-sufficiency—why then bear the burden of benevolence and righteousness, rushing about in pursuit of worn traces? Like the egret’s whiteness and the crow’s blackness, things naturally form their own groups—what need is there for distinction? The mutual wetting of fish stranded in drought reveals a compassionate sentiment, yet how does this compare to the joy of forgetting one another in rivers and lakes?

When Confucius saw Lao Dan and called him a dragon, it was because the dragon, in profound union with primordial qi, coalesces to form its body, and in soaring flight, scatters to display its splendor. Its emergence and withdrawal are without intent, thus it rides upon the clouds; its movement and stillness accord with the seasons, thus it nurtures itself in yin and yang. Lao Dan’s sagely virtue was as unfathomable as this—what place was there for my admonitions to take hold?

*Yongzhai’s note:* "Feasting on the skin" and "chaff in the eye" are metaphors for perverse and contrary impulses. *Jian* means poison, denoting their bitterness. *Fen* means opposition. "Emulating the wind" means following transformation. *Zong* means to grasp. If the world did not lose its original simplicity, all would follow transformation in their actions and stand firm in virtue—what need would there be for teaching? It would be like carrying a great drum to seek the lost—no way to find them. The magpie’s whiteness and the crow’s blackness require no washing or dyeing; their natural qualities are self-evident—no need for debate. To display fame and reputation before the world is to invite judgment and division, and thus the mind cannot expand.

How long can fish stranded in drought sustain their mutual wetting? If they dwelt in rivers and lakes, they would forget one another in the water—a metaphor for the age of the utmost Dao, where all follow their nature without judgment, and superiors and inferiors likewise forget one another. "Coalescing to form its body" describes its undifferentiated wholeness; "scattering to display its splendor" describes its radiant manifestation. The dragon moves between heaven and earth, visible yet not visible. "Riding upon the clouds" places it above creation; "nurturing itself in yin and yang" means it delights in the Way of heaven and earth.

When Confucius saw Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness, it was no different from discoursing on Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren. Thus, Lao Dan used chaff in the eye, mosquitoes feasting on the skin, and other metaphors to illustrate how benevolence and righteousness stir opposition in the heart, further sealing the world’s vital points to allow all to recover their undifferentiated truth. To transform things, move them with the wind; to cultivate the self, stand without losing virtue. Why must one proudly brandish the name of benevolence and righteousness as the ultimate attainment of the Dao? It would be like carrying a drum to seek the lost—no way to find them.

The magpie and crow require no washing or dyeing for their whiteness and blackness to be known—thus, no need for debate. The utmost Dao is vast and boundless, beyond naming or speech; to seek it in the reputation of benevolence and righteousness—how could this suffice to broaden it? Like fish in drought wetting one another, their affection is not without intimacy, yet how does this compare to the joy of forgetting one another in rivers and lakes? Yet the present age precisely takes such fleeting affection as benevolence, unaware that the sage does not transform through benevolence to its utmost.

When Confucius saw Lao Dan, he returned and spoke no more, for the Dao was present in the glance—no words were needed. The dragon’s formation of its body, its radiant display, its riding upon the clouds, its nurturing in yin and yang—all accord with the seasons in movement and stillness, its virtue and blessings extending to things while its spiritual transformations remain unfathomable. Thus, the ancients, in discussing sages and spirit-men, always used the dragon as a metaphor. None but Confucius could depict Lao Dan’s virtue, and none but Lao Dan could be worthy of Confucius’s metaphor. Yet these two sages, paragons of human relations, fully manifested the functions of the seven treasures, each illuminating the other—no room for ranking superiority between them.

**Heaven’s Movement (Chapter Four)**

Zigong asked: "Then are there indeed men who dwell in stillness like a corpse yet manifest like a dragon, who thunder in voice yet abide in profound silence, whose actions move like heaven and earth? Might I be permitted to witness such a one?" Thereupon, he sought out Lao Dan on Confucius’s reputation.

Lao Dan was just then reclining in his hall when he responded, softly saying: "My years have advanced and departed—what would you admonish me with?"

Zigong said: "The governance of the Three Kings and Five Emperors differed in method, yet their fame and renown were one. Why then did the former kings alone deem them not sages?"

Lao Dan said: "Young man, come closer! Why do you say they differed?"

Zigong replied: "Yao yielded to Shun, Shun yielded to Yu, Yu relied on labor while Tang relied on arms, King Wen served Zhou without daring to oppose, and King Wu opposed Zhou without consenting to serve. Thus, I say they differed."

Lao Dan said: "Young man, step back! Let me tell you of the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. The Yellow Emperor’s governance made the people’s hearts unified—when their kin died, they did not weep, yet none among the people condemned it. Yao’s governance made the people’s hearts affectionate—when they killed for their kin, none condemned it. Shun’s governance made the people’s hearts competitive—pregnant women bore children in ten months, and the children could speak at five months; before they could even babble, they began to choose between people, and thus men began to die young. Yu’s governance made the people’s hearts mutable—men had intentions, and weapons had alignment; killing thieves was not killing men. Each regarded themselves as a separate kind, and the world was thus thrown into great alarm. The Ru and Mohists all arose. Their beginnings had order, yet now, what can be said of women today?

"I tell you of the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors—though called ‘governance,’ no chaos was greater! The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns above obscured the brightness of sun and moon, below severed the essence of mountains and rivers, and within disrupted the operations of the four seasons. Their knowledge trespassed upon the tails of fleas and lice, the beasts of the wilds—none could secure the natural course of their lives and natures. Yet they still deemed themselves sages. Is this not shameful? Truly, it is shameless!"

Zigong stood uneasily, shifting from foot to foot.

---

**Guo’s Commentary:**
"When kin died and none wept, if the people had condemned it, they would have forced themselves to weep. ‘Killing their killers’ refers to the gradations of mourning attire. That children could speak at five months means instruction was hastened. That they chose people before they could babble means competition in teaching was premature. Unable to harmonize self and other, their hearts competed in closeness and distance, thus they did not live out their natural years. ‘Weapons had alignment’ means the world already had disorder. Thieves deserved death; killing them was not murder. Unable to unify the myriad things, each man distinguished himself, and thus each became his own kind. Seeking to harmonize the currents of a hundred generations with the changes of the present age, the flaw reached this point—not through Yu, but through the world itself. To say the path of sagely wisdom did not throw the world into chaos, yet the world still fell into such disorder—this is the flaw of a hundred generations. The Ru and Mohists all arose from this. Today, women are taken as wives, yet above and below are in rebellion. This is not because the beginnings lacked principle, but because the flaw in the highest principle led to this. What more can be said? Even the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors could not escape such flaws. Zigong had originally thought Laozi alone rejected the Three Kings, so he sought to equate them with the Five Emperors. Now, seeing Laozi universally condemn the Five Emperors and even the Three Sovereigns, he lost the basis of his argument and thus stood uneasily."

**Lü’s Commentary:**
"Laozi compared benevolence and righteousness disturbing the heart to chaff blinding the eyes or mosquitoes and gadflies biting the skin. Thus, he deemed the Five Emperors and Three Kings not sages. Zigong then inquired about yielding and contention, compliance and opposition, which were even cruder distinctions. Speaking in sequence, making the people’s hearts mutable was certainly not as good as affection, and affection was not as good as unity—yet all alike failed to avoid governing the world while giving the people intentions. Though called ‘governance,’ it was from this that the world’s chaos began. If knowledge is employed, it is not only the Five Emperors and Three Kings—even the wisdom of the Three Sovereigns would above obscure the sun and moon, below sever mountains and rivers, and their knowledge would trespass upon the tails of fleas and lice! Beasts that dwell in mountains and forests, moving by night and resting by day, though hungry and thirsty, still roam freely upon rivers and lakes—how much more so for the wildest creatures! Zigong heard Laozi condemn the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors but could not grasp the reason, so he stood uneasily."

**Lin’s Commentary:**
"'Dwelling like a corpse yet manifesting like a dragon, thundering in voice yet abiding in profound silence'—these are the affairs of spirit-men. ‘Reclining’ means sitting without pretense or response. ‘Softly’ means responding out of necessity. ‘Years advanced and departed’ means he was already old. The Three Kings and Five Emperors were names of sages; governing the world was the sages’ advancement. Though their methods differed, their fame was tied to this, so Laozi condemned them. If it were the heart of a sage, there would be no difference! Yu governed the waters, so he relied on labor. Tang overthrew Jie, so he relied on arms. King Wen served Yin, and King Wu overthrew Zhou—thus, I say they differed. In the time of the Yellow Emperor, the people did not exclusively cherish their own kin or love their own children, so there were those who did not weep when their kin died, and the world did not condemn it—purely following the Dao of heaven to govern. By the time of Yao, the law was perfected, descending from heaven into man, and the people’s hearts were already affectionate. Yet rites and laws were not yet detailed, so there were those who killed in their kin’s mourning, and the people did not condemn it. By Shun, the world was governed purely by the human Dao, and the people not only had affection but competition arose. Thus, simplicity was dispersed, the great Dao was abandoned, and benevolence and righteousness emerged! Human desires multiplied, so pregnant women bore children in ten months."

Instruction came too swiftly, so children could speak at five months. Before reaching the age of toddling, they already distinguished who was who—the heart of infancy was lost so readily! How far removed was this from the Way of spirit-men who never die?

By the time of Yu, the people’s hearts held competition, and simplicity and purity were transformed. Yet when he waged war and launched punitive expeditions, he never acted against the people’s will. Those he killed were thieves, and his aim was to end killing. As the *Book* says: “Punishment aims at no punishment.” Thus, he could not fully unify the myriad things, and each person distinguished themselves, dividing into clans and throwing the world into disorder.

Once the governance of emperors and kings had decayed, the disputes of Confucians and Mohists all arose. This was not because their beginnings lacked order, but because long accumulation led to corruption. Thus, taking women as wives and the inversion of high and low—nothing was more perverse than in this era. What more could be said?

Even rare creatures and tiny beasts do not stray from the natural course of their lives—how much more so for the people!

**Blue Void’s Annotation:**
Without speech, transformation spreads—like a corpse dwelling yet a dragon appearing.
A name resounds while the self remains obscure—like thunder’s roar in the depths of silence.
Rising and falling follow constancy, movement and action like heaven and earth.

The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors differed in virtue, their governance distinct, yet all were bound to fame and reputation. The Yellow Emperor’s governance of the world was all-embracing and forgetful, so when kin died, none wept, and the people did not condemn it. Yao governed the world by fostering affection in the people’s hearts, so when kin were killed in mourning, the people did not condemn it. Shun governed the world by fostering competition in the people’s hearts, so pregnancies came early, children spoke before toddling, and people began to die young. Yu governed the world by transforming the people’s hearts, so they toiled ceaselessly for livelihood, and each harbored private intentions. Yet when they were punished, none resented it, for warfare had its proper place.

Yu passed the throne to Qi, and the world was transformed—thus it was said that “people formed their own clans.” This was not the private act of one man, so it was called “the world.” Yet when the sagely and wise arose, the world was alarmed; Confucians and Mohists flourished, and the great Dao was divided. It was fitting that maidens married early and the constant norms of human relations were taught—such was the consequence of establishing laws to achieve order, for when laws changed, chaos followed.

Eclipses of the sun and moon, the crumbling of mountains and drying of rivers, the disruption of the four seasons, and the excesses of climate—these inharmonious qi were less severe than the creeping vines of disorder that caused the myriad things to lose the natural course of their lives. This was the fault of governing the state through knowledge.

**Yongzhai’s Note:**
When Confucius’s reputation reached Lao Dan, he sent his disciples to pay respects. “Arrogant in the hall,” showing disdain. “Subtle in response,” their exchanges were barely audible.

The Yellow Emperor’s governance followed nature, and each subsequent era declined further. Mourning garments were graded by the weight of kinship—this was not so in ancient times but was established by later ritual. In antiquity, children were born after fourteen months and did not speak until two years old. Now they were born in ten months and spoke at five, able to ask who someone was before they could toddle.

“Heart transformed” meant changed from antiquity. “People had hearts” meant each harbored private intentions. “Warfare had its proper place” meant that waging war was deemed proper. Thieves could be killed, and laws were detailed. At this time, people all distinguished their own clans, loving their own kin and children, merely sharing this world together.

In its beginnings, there was still the Way of human relations, but its corruption led to the inversion of norms—taking women as wives—what more could be said? The *Record of Rites*’s passage on the great Dao and public-mindedness shares this intent.

Earlier, the Three Sovereigns were highly revered, but here they are equally denigrated, for even their knowledge could disrupt the principles of heaven and earth’s creation—poisonous as creeping vines. *Jie* means “few.” *Gui* means “to seek.”

The desires of small beasts were few, yet even they could not preserve the natural state of their lives. When the corpse sits still yet the dragon appears, the obscure becomes manifest in clarity. When thunder rumbles in the abyss of silence, harmony is heard in the absence of sound. Their movements were like those of heaven and earth, for yin and yang turned as one. This was Zigong’s praise and admiration for Lao Dan’s virtue, the reason he wished to meet him.

Lao Dan was then seated upright in the hall, rapt in stillness, still yet ever-responsive, answering even the most subtle of questions. Zigong said that the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors differed, yet all bound their reputations to the world, first unifying the people’s hearts, then inciting their competition. As hearts changed, the world’s Dao declined further, and human hearts grew ever more deficient.

Not weeping at a parent’s death, shortening the mourning period—these were but minor omissions in ritual, not yet deeply harmful. But when children were born after ten months and spoke at five, transformation came too swiftly, and the people began to die young. With private intentions and personal inclinations, each treated themselves as a separate kind, and the world was thrown into chaos.

Tracing its origins, human relations were not entirely absent at first, yet in the end, they were never truly established. For their pursuit of order was excessive, failing to consider the nature of things, and forcing the world to follow their will—this was the very cause of disorder. What more could be said?

The knowledge of the Three Sovereigns had not strayed far from nature, yet it still disrupted the sun and moon, cast down mountains and rivers, and encroached upon the tail of the creeping vine. If even insects and beasts could not preserve the natural state of their lives, what could be said of the people? How much worse for later ages, where men indulged their emotions and relied on cunning and artifice?

How could such an approach ever convey the meaning of governing the state not by knowledge, or the blessing of the state’s fortune?

Confucius said to Lao Dan: “I have studied the Six Classics—*The Book of Songs*, *The Book of Documents*, *The Rites*, *Music*, *The Book of Changes*, and *The Spring and Autumn Annals*—for a long time, and I believe I understand their principles. Yet when I advised seventy-two rulers, expounding the Way of the former kings and clarifying the teachings of Zhou and Shao, not a single ruler adopted them. How difficult it is to persuade men! How hard it is to make the Dao clear!”

Laozi said: "Fortunate indeed! That you have not encountered a ruler of a well-governed age! The *Six Classics* are but the worn-out tracks of the former kings—how could they be the very tracks themselves? What you now speak of is but the near at hand. Tracks are what shoes produce, yet are tracks the same as shoes?

The white pheasants gaze at one another, their pupils unmoving, and the wind carries their transformation. The male insect cries upon the upwind, the female responds from downwind, and the wind carries their transformation. Each kind has its own male and female, thus the wind carries their transformation. Nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, and the Dao cannot be obstructed.

If one attains the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be; if one loses it, there is nothing that can be. After three months, Confucius reappeared and said: 'I have grasped it! Crows and magpies nurture their young, fish coat themselves in foam, the slender-waisted wasp transforms, and when a younger brother is born, the elder brother weeps. How long it has been since I participated in transformation as a human! If one does not participate in transformation as a human, how can one transform others?'

Laozi said: 'Good! You have grasped it!'

Guo’s commentary: What advances is true nature. Following the true nature of things, what advances is the *Six Classics*. Yet in the affairs of men today, the natural is treated as shoes, and the *Six Classics* as tracks. Pheasants gaze at one another with their pupils unmoving, insects respond to each other’s cries, and both conceive without union—thus it is called 'wind transformation.' The males and females of the same kind each have their own means of mutual resonance. The variations in their resonance are beyond measure; if they belong to the same kind, their transformation is not difficult. Thus, there are even those who resonate from afar and are transformed by the wind. The perfected person follows and penetrates all, and though transformation has no fixed method, all is possible.

Those who lose the Dao have no way to succeed, just as crows nurture their young, fish coat themselves in foam, and the slender-waisted wasp transforms—each thing has its own natural disposition. Human nature, however, abandons the elder to favor the younger, hence the elder brother weeps when a younger brother is born. One who participates in transformation as a human follows their natural transformation; to expound the classics in explanation is already a deviation.

Lü’s commentary: The *Six Classics* are the laws of the former kings, their standards and measures set forth in writing—yet these are not what transform. What transforms is the numinous clarity alone. Tracks are what shoes produce, yet are tracks the same as the teachings? To transform by such means, the world rightly does not employ them.

The white pheasants gaze at one another, their pupils unmoving, and the wind carries their transformation—what resonates is the spirit, not sound. The male insect cries upon the upwind, the female responds from downwind, resonating through sound, not form. Each kind has its own male and female, thus the wind carries their transformation. In such cases, nature differs and cannot be altered, fate is fixed and cannot be changed, time flows and cannot be halted, and the Dao is unobstructed and cannot be blocked. How could this be fathomed by words, deliberation, or conjecture?"

Thus we know that what transforms the world does not lie in the presentation of precedents, but in seeking the Dao alone. Confucius attained this within three months—during his purification of mind and disciplining of form—awakening to the fact that crows, magpies, fish, and bees all live, yet the means by which they live are never the same. What knowledge cannot grasp is transformation alone!

A brother weeps for his younger sibling—emotion compels him so. Transformation allows all to live equally; emotion, however, prevents even brothers from sharing the same lot. To wish for others’ transformation is difficult indeed!

Long has it been—since Qiu ceased to be shaped by transformation as others are, he became one with the Dao and no longer aligned with the Creator’s design for humanity. How then could he transform others? Those who study Confucius yet fail to grasp his means of advancement invariably falter here.

**Du Yi’s Annotation:**
To govern the world by reciting the *Six Classics* without seeking their intent in virtue, power, nature, and destiny is like mistaking the track for the shoe that made it. The white pheasant and the insects both transform through the wind, requiring no union for offspring to arise. Male and female of the same kind each possess their own means of resonance; when kindred meet, transformation comes effortlessly. These are the natural principles of creation, the unalterable nature of destiny, the unstoppable flow of time, and the unobstructed Dao. One must simply allow them to unfold—never forcing the precedents of former kings to disrupt their natural essence.

The three months mark a single shift in the celestial seasons, illustrating the difficulty of awakening to the Dao. The magpie, fish, and bee—none of these generate life through lustful desire, and thus Confucius used them to elucidate Laozi’s teaching on the Dao.

"A brother weeps for his younger sibling" speaks to how people often cherish the young while neglecting the elder. "Long has it been" indicates this did not arise overnight. To "be shaped by transformation as others are" is to follow the Creator’s cycles of life and death without attachment, so that one may abandon the recitations of the *Six Classics* and allow others to transform naturally.

**Bixu’s Annotation:**
The wisdom of sages and worthies is applied in the present moment. What remains today are but bamboo slips and silk scrolls!

Do the responses truly align with practical affairs? The fitting response becomes one’s path; the excessive response becomes a thoroughfare. When white pheasants gaze at one another and call in harmony, where is there a thoroughfare? The nature of the worthy and the foolish cannot be altered; the fate of the noble and the base cannot be changed; the times of adversity and prosperity cannot be halted; the Dao of the sage cannot be obstructed.

To awaken is to turn tiles and pebbles into gold; to be deluded is to see jade as mere stone. Confucius thus realized that the magpie’s nestlings, the fish’s foam, and the bee’s offspring all arise of themselves, without reliance on anything external. Even between brothers born in succession, there is still partiality and affection—how much more so between different eras? This speaks to how each thing transforms on its own; how could there be one who partakes in transformation yet cannot transform others?

**Luanzhai’s Note:**
Where there is a path, there is a thoroughfare. To grasp advancement yet fail to grasp the path is like the parable of the dregs. From "When white pheasants gaze at one another" onward, the text is most extraordinary. All things are born of wind and qi, hence the term "wind-transformation." Each kind pairs as male and female, forming its own category among the myriad things, thus enabling such wind-transformation.

Nature, fate, time, and the Dao—all speak to the principle of spontaneity that cannot be defied. "Nestlings" refers to mating; "foam" refers to mutual moisture giving rise to life. Brothers share the same mother, yet after the first suckles, the milk ceases, so the elder, denied milk, weeps. "Not partaking in transformation as others do" means knowing humanity but not Heaven, failing to unite with the workings of creation.

This chapter uses the principle of creation’s ceaseless generation to illustrate the Dao of spontaneity, further asserting that what Confucians study is all "action with purpose." If one acts without purpose, one’s achievement aligns with creation. The deeper intent is to make people realize that this body arises from nothingness and is one with the myriad things, thereby shattering the worldly hearts of self-interest and self-love!

When white pheasants gaze at one another, when insects call and respond, each pairs as male and female by kind, thus wind-transformation. This is what is meant by "the two essences contend and the spirit responds," the natural principle of yin and yang seeking one another. Thus, nature and fate cannot be altered; time and the Dao cannot be obstructed.

From "The magpie rears its young" to "a brother weeps for his younger sibling," these four lines seem obscure at first reading, but upon close examination, their meaning on transformation is vast. The principles of embryonic, hatching, moist, and metamorphic transformation are all contained within, though people fail to perceive them. The waxing and waning of Heaven and Earth, the mechanisms of creation’s ebb and flow—though silently operating in the formless—are all revealed through the four modes of birth. Among these four, humans are the masters; among the multitudes, sages are the masters. The sage, who transforms by partaking in transformation, thus knows Heaven.

Thus, this chapter concludes with a discussion of transformation. If one does not govern Heaven and Earth, administer the myriad things, and act alone as the pivot of nurturing transformation, how can one transform others? The Most High said: "I act without purpose, and the people transform themselves." Observe the wind-transformation of pheasants and insects, the hatching of magpies, the foam-spawning of fish, the offspring of bees—all arise from natural nature, perfected through focused and steadfast effort. This resonance and response cannot be forced or explained; thus, it is called transformation. Humans, being the most spiritually endowed, possess a transformation even more wondrous than these, yet it does not exceed the principle of spontaneity and the effort of steadfast focus.

Thus, the *Doctrine of the Mean* states: "Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can transform." Even with Confucius’ sageliness, he fasted and purified his heart for three months before attaining it—how could the subtleties of great transformation be lightly discussed?

This treatise begins with the movements of Heaven and the positioning of Earth, posing questions about the reasons for the sun, moon, wind, and clouds flowing and operating. It answers with the six directions and the five constants, the governance of the Supreme Sovereign, who embodies Heaven’s movements to enact virtue and teaching, thus transforming without purpose while the people delight in spontaneity.

Next, it discusses the utmost benevolence being without partiality, the utmost nobility casting aside rank, and acting without contrivance—also modeling the principle of Heaven’s movements. As for the performance of music on Dongting Lake, it clarifies the profundity of the Great Dao, harmonizing with yin and yang, enacting ritual and righteousness—this interdependence of Heaven and humanity is the foundation of establishing the ultimate.

Regulating the four seasons, harmonizing the myriad things, aligning cold and heat in proper sequence—this is the origin of generation and transformation. Moving without fixed direction yet dwelling in the profound and obscure, the celestial mechanism pauses while the five officials are complete—thus, one follows things in concealment, manifesting wherever touched, unbound by form or exhausted by sound, roaming freely. Wherever one arrives, there is nothing but utmost harmony; where silence abides, there is nothing but utmost joy.

As for governance, it is likened to the straw dogs already used in sacrifice; laws and institutions are like the opposed flavors of coarse and fine grains. The monkey tears the robe of the Duke of Zhou; the ugly woman mimics the beauty of Xi Shi—this illustrates that governance values appropriateness, and cooking the fresh lies in not stirring. For those in high position, if they can truly embody the Dao and model Heaven, moving in unison with transformation, timing their encouragement and nurturing to ripen and perfect, how could the people fail to be transformed?

When Confucius met Laozi, he sighed that he was like a dragon, for aligning humanity with Heaven had not yet reached complete transformation. Upon hearing the subtleties of the profound thunder, he then abandoned the well-trodden paths of the *Six Classics* to investigate their underlying principles. Within three months, partaking in transformation as others do, his path became one with humanity while his essence united with Heaven.

The *Book of Changes* states: "Heaven’s movement is ceaselessly vigorous"—this is what is meant by "movement." "Essence and qi become things; the wandering soul becomes change"—this is what is meant by "transformation"!

**Chapter One: On the Carving of Intent**

Those who carve their intent and esteem conduct, distancing themselves from the world and differing from common customs, who indulge in lofty discourse and resentful slander—doing so only to assert their superiority—these are the preferences of the recluses of mountains and valleys, the unworldly, the withered, and those who plunge into the abyss.

Those who speak of benevolence and righteousness, loyalty and trust, reverence and frugality, deference and yielding—doing so only to cultivate themselves—these are the preferences of the gentlemen of orderly times, the instructive, and the wandering scholars who dwell in ease.

Those who speak of great achievements, establish grand reputations, honor the rituals between ruler and minister, and rectify the hierarchy of superior and inferior—doing so only to govern—these are the preferences of the courtiers, those who exalt their lords and strengthen their states, and the ambitious who seek to merge accomplishments.

Those who retreat to marshes and lakes, dwell in seclusion and vast solitude, fish and idle in stillness—doing so only to practice non-action—these are the preferences of the recluses of rivers and seas, those who flee the world, and the leisurely.

Those who practice breath control, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, emulate the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching—doing so only to prolong life—these are the preferences of the practitioners of *daoyin*, those who nurture the body, and the long-lived like Pengzu.

Yet there are those who attain loftiness without carving intent, cultivate themselves without benevolence and righteousness, govern without achievements or fame, find tranquility without rivers or seas, and prolong life without *daoyin*. They forget nothing, yet possess all things. Serene and boundless, all virtues follow them.

This is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.

Thus it is said: Serenity, stillness, emptiness, and non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth, the essence of the Dao and virtue.

Guo Xiang’s commentary: These various types, each with different preferences, indulge their inclinations and follow their own paths—this too is a form of freedom. Yet each attains only their own fulfillment; how could they establish all things? As for one who enables the myriad things to each fulfill their nature without self-loss, they must guide without clinging to any fixed action. Forgetting, they are thus able to possess; if they possessed, they could not save themselves from forgetting. Thus possession is not possession through possession, but possession through forgetting. If one forces oneself to act, they cannot remain boundless, and manifold evils arise.

That which does not act for the myriad things yet allows them to arise of themselves—this is Heaven and Earth. That which does not act for the hundred conducts yet allows them to perfect themselves—this is the sage. Without stillness and non-action, their equilibrium is imperiled, and their essence is lost.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: From carving intent to seek loftiness to practicing *daoyin* to prolong life, all depend on external things and cannot achieve the state of "forgetting nothing, possessing all." Only in serene boundlessness do they escape the servitude of carving intent, benevolence, righteousness, achievements, or fame. All virtues follow them, and the loftiness, cultivation, governance, leisure, and longevity they sought come unbidden. Such is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage. Thus, to forget nothing and possess all is to be unburdened by being or non-being—this is the meaning of non-action.

Lin Qindu’s commentary: Those who strive for loftiness do not yet know cultivation; those who soar do not yet know governance; those who govern do not yet know non-action; those who practice non-action do not yet attain longevity; those who seek longevity do not yet master death and dissolution. Each is confined by their own limitations—none compare to the sage’s completeness. The sage attains loftiness without carving intent, cultivates without benevolence or righteousness, governs without achievements or fame, finds leisure without rivers or seas, and prolongs life without *daoyin*. Forgetting nothing, they abide in constant non-being; possessing all, they abide in constant being. Yet constant non-being is not true absence, nor is constant being true presence. Thus, serene and boundless, all virtues gather to them. The virtue of Heaven and Earth is likewise.

Serenity and emptiness both arise from the Dao and virtue. Distinguishing them: serenity and stillness are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth; emptiness and non-action are the essence of the Dao and virtue.

Chen Bixu’s commentary: Lofty discourse—Xu You and Shan Juan. Rejecting the world—Bo Yi and Shu Qi. Withered and withered—Jie Zitui. Plunging into the abyss—Shentu Di and Bian Sui. Advancing and dwelling in learning—Confucius by the Yi and Si rivers, Zixia in the West River. Achieving merit—I Yin, Lü Wang, Guan Zhong, and Shang Yang. Marshes and lakes—Chaofu and Yan Guang. Leisure and seclusion—Gongyue Xiu and the shepherd boy. Fishing—Ren Gongzi and the Fisherman. Breath control—embryonic breathing and the six qi. Bear climbing and bird stretching—derivations of the marsh spirit’s five movements.

To forget and possess is to forget possession and enter the ultimate. Heaven and Earth are empty at their center, yet the myriad things arise; the sage is without mind, yet all virtues are perfected. Stillness is the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth; emptiness and non-action are the essence of the Dao and virtue.

Lin Yongzhai’s *Oral Teachings* states: To toil with intent, prizing action, espousing lofty theories, resenting the world, and detesting evil—this is striving for loftiness. Withered and withered—profound stillness. Plunging into the abyss—entering the mountains deeply. Cultivation—pursuing purity and teaching as a master in the world. Achieving merit—contemporary examples noted by Zhuangzi. Recluses and hidden scholars transcend right and wrong, unlike those who defy the world. Bear climbing and bird stretching—Hua Tuo’s Five Animal Frolics. To forget nothing and possess all is to practice non-action and yet act in all ways. Boundlessness—no fixed limit. All virtues follow—embodying all goodness. The sage embodies the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth, hence this attainment. The essence of the Dao refers to its inherent nature.

Chu Shi’s *Superficial Observations*: This chapter begins by discussing the differing aspirations of ancient worthies, from withered recluses to those who nurture the body for longevity—all are evident. Yet to attain loftiness without carving intent, to prolong life without *daoyin*, to forget and to possess, serene and immeasurable—this is the complete beauty of Heaven and Earth, the supreme virtue of the sage. It is not like the earlier cases, each clinging to partial views and believing themselves fulfilled. It is like Boyi’s purity and Hou Ji’s harmony, yet only Confucius is called "sage for the times"—the one who embodies the great synthesis. Only by forgetting all can one possess all; if one clings to possession, how can they ever attain forgetting?

A potter can shape myriad vessels, yet no vessel can shape a potter. Only by being formless can one shape forms; only by being non-thing can one master things. The virtue of Heaven and Earth and the sage is likewise.

Thus it is said: When the sage rests in ease, they are level and yielding; being level and yielding, they are serene. Serene and level, worries and afflictions cannot enter, and perverse qi cannot assail. Thus their virtue is whole, and their spirit is unharmed.

Thus it is said: The sage’s life follows the movement of Heaven; their death is the transformation of things. At rest, they share the virtue of yin; in motion, they move with the wave of yang. They do not precede fortune nor initiate misfortune. They respond only when stimulated, move only when pressed, and rise only when compelled. They discard knowledge and precedent, following the principle of Heaven. Thus they are free from heavenly disasters, unburdened by things, unblamed by people, and unaccused by spirits. Their life is like floating; their death is like resting. They do not scheme or plan ahead. Radiant yet not dazzling, trustworthy yet not bound by promises. In sleep, they do not dream; awake, they have no worries. Their spirit is pure and unadulterated; their po is not wearied.

Empty and serene, vast and unburdened—thus do they align with Heaven’s virtue. It is said: sorrow and joy are perversions of virtue; delight and anger are transgressions of the Dao; likes and dislikes are lapses in virtue. Therefore, a heart free from sorrow and joy is the perfection of virtue; unchanging unity is the perfection of stillness; non-action is the perfection of emptiness; non-engagement with things is the perfection of blandness; non-resistance is the perfection of purity.

Guo’s commentary: Abiding in serenity and ease, in stillness and silence, resting in emptiness and non-action—even when traversing perilous changes, one remains level and untroubled. Trouble arises from action; action arises from trouble. Thus, tranquility and simplicity interweave, dissolving into the natural principle and proceeding as one with it. Those who are neither level nor at ease—do they merely harm their form? Their spirit and virtue perish within.

Heaven’s movement follows its own natural course. Transformation of things is a shedding of all ties, motion and stillness without intent, entrusted to yin and yang, without leading or prompting. They move only when the moment arrives, rising as the principle demands. Heaven’s principle is spontaneous; knowledge and precedent are absent from its inquiry. Thus, disaster arises from defying Heaven; burdens arise from resisting things. Those who align with others are approved by the multitude, for they accord with self-attainment—hence, no blame. Life is like floating; death is like resting—indifferent, with nothing to regret. Entrusted to Heaven’s principle, they respond when the principle arrives. They employ the world’s own radiance, not their own dazzling; they employ the world’s own trustworthiness, not their own promises. Desiring nothing, their hun-soul is not wearied. Thus do they unite with Heaven and Earth in their serene and bland virtue. Supreme virtue is ever at ease; emotions find no foothold.

Stillness and unity cannot be altered. Utterly open and unobstructed, they admit not even the slightest discord—things come of themselves. The supremely bland harbor no inclination to engage with things; if mixed with turbid desires, there will be resistance. Lü’s commentary: The sage rests content, not enslaving the mind to grasping or discarding. Level, they do not incline; simple, they do not struggle. Serene, they are without knowledge; at ease, they do not engage with things. This is what is meant by "stillness and non-action"—nothing more.

Worry and trouble are the means by which perverse qi gains entry and assails, for knowledge and engagement with things create fissures. In life, following Heaven’s movement, they have never truly lived—thus, they do not heed departure. In death, transformed by things, they have never truly died—thus, they do not resist arrival. At rest, they share the virtue of yin, unaware of their stillness. In motion, they move with the wave of yang, unaware of their movement. Not preceding fortune, fortune does not arrive. Not initiating misfortune, misfortune does not come. To seek fortune or initiate misfortune, to respond without stimulus, to move without pressure, to rise without compulsion—this is to employ knowledge and precedent, the work of man. Following the spontaneity of Heaven’s principle, Heaven cannot bring disaster, things cannot impose burdens—thus, no blame from people, no accusations from spirits. How fitting!

Life floats; death rests—unmoved by feeling, responding when things arrive, their radiance arises from Heaven’s light, not from contrivance. Within, there is trustworthiness, not binding promises. Without dreams or worries, waking and sleeping are the same. Purity is unadulterated; non-fatigue arises from non-action. Heaven’s virtue is how the sage governs all under Heaven.

The emotions of sorrow and joy are hard to relinquish—hence, they are perversions of virtue. Delight and anger arise and vanish in an instant—hence, they are transgressions of the Dao. All four stem from likes and dislikes; likes and dislikes are the unmanifest sorrow, joy, delight, and anger. The human heart, ceaselessly churning with ten thousand thoughts—how can it attain even a moment of stillness? The virtuous one, free from sorrow and joy, attains unchanging unity—this is the perfection of stillness. Without fear, like an empty boat striking an object yet unprovoked—this is the perfection of emptiness. Not engaging with things, without flavor—this is the perfection of blandness. Thus, even entering water or treading fire, everywhere is oneself—how could there be resistance? This is the perfection of purity.

**Doubts Resolved, Annotation:**

The movements of Heaven are *timeliness*; the sage in life abides in its season.
The transformations of things are *compliance*; the sage in death dwells in its accord.
Though yin and yang differ, their benefit to things is the same.
Stillness is thus spoken of in terms of *virtue*; movement, in terms of *ripples*.
Fortune is the recompense of *rightness*.
Misfortune is the summons of *wrongness*.
If right and wrong do not originate from oneself, how could calamity or blessing take root?
Though right and wrong dissolve into the Dao, when stirred by externals, there must be response; when pressed, there must be movement—only then, and not before, do they arise.

He who seeks fortune at the onset of misfortune possesses *knowledge*.
He who responds without being stirred, moves without being pressed, embodies *constancy*.
Discard knowledge and constancy, and one follows the natural—free from celestial disasters, then free from the burdens of things; free from human reproach, then free from spectral blame.
Life drifts, death rests—thus, one knows neither delight nor aversion.
He who does not ponder acts without weariness.
He who does not premeditate has no cause for apprehension.
Not flaunting oneself prevents the birth of doubt and confusion.
Not scheming ensures great trust without covenant.
Sleeping without dreams, waking without care—such is the wholeness of spirit.
Purity and unweariedness also arise from this.
Emptiness and nothingness suffice to reveal *non-action*; tranquility and vastness suffice to reveal stillness.
In this, one aligns with Heaven’s virtue—thus, sorrow, joy, delight, anger, likes, and dislikes become the perversions and transgressions of the Dao and virtue.

When viewed through the Dao of Heaven, there is no sorrow, joy, delight, anger, likes, or dislikes.
When viewed through the Dao of man, these six cannot be avoided.
Thus, freedom from sorrow and joy is the perfection of virtue, clarifying that delight is its perversion.
Unchanging is the perfection of stillness, clarifying that delight and anger are its transgressions.
Without obstruction is the perfection of emptiness, clarifying that likes and dislikes are its flaws.
Not engaging with things further clarifies the meaning of "without obstruction."
Without resistance further clarifies the meaning of "not engaging with things"—thus is the perfection of purity.

**Bixu’s Annotation:**
Anxiety and weariness enter where ease is absent; worldly qi assails where tranquility is lacking.
For one whose spirit and virtue are whole and complete, what filth could stain them?
Life’s fleeting arrival follows Heaven’s course; death’s fleeting departure follows the transformations of things.
It neither diminishes nor augments one’s true nature, attaining the essence of yin and yang.
Not taking the lead in the world, one fundamentally does not respond—yet responds when stirred; fundamentally does not move—yet moves when pressed; fundamentally does not arise—yet arises when unavoidable.
Following Heaven’s principle without deceit, forgetting the burdens of things without arrogance.
With no human reproach, how could spectral blame exist?
Life drifts, death rests—following principle and abiding in nature, concealing one’s light and hiding one’s brilliance.
Great trust requires no covenant; waking and dreaming are naturally attained; spirit and soul leave no trace.
Emptiness, nothingness, tranquility, and blandness—these align with Heaven’s virtue.
The cultivator of virtue forgets sorrow and joy; the follower of the Dao forgets delight and anger.
Losing oneself lies in likes and dislikes.
Thus, the perfection of virtue is serene and formless within; the perfection of stillness cannot be swayed by life or transformation; the perfection of emptiness has no obstruction; the perfection of blandness distances itself from the vulgar; the perfection of purity encounters no resistance.

**Fu Zhai’s Annotation:**
Ease and tranquility are none other than *non-action*.
An unharmed spirit is none other than wholeness of virtue.
"Heaven’s movements" means acting in accord with Heaven’s principle.
"Transformations of things" means regarding the body as a cast-off husk.
Responding to stimuli, I harbor no intent; moving when pressed, arising when unavoidable—all express the intent of responding to things without attachment.
Discard private wisdom, depart from contrivance, and one follows the natural.
Floating or resting, drifting without attachment—what thoughts or schemes could there be?
Shining yet concealing oneself, one need not rely on things.
Spirit whole, thus pure and unwearied; soul at rest, thus untroubled.
All sorrow, joy, likes, and dislikes are not natural.
Only when sorrow and joy do not bind the heart is one’s virtue perfected.
Abiding in unity without distraction, one follows the natural—though engaging with things, one is not burdened by them.
Stillness, emptiness, blandness, purity—these are the virtues of the natural, merely expounded thus.
*Xiuxiu* describes a demeanor of harmony and joy.
Thus, ease and tranquility repel anxiety and perversity, for one’s virtue is whole and spirit unharmed.

"Heaven’s movements" speak of the circulation of a single qi; "transformations of things" speak of the dispersal of a single qi—this is what is meant by "same virtue, same ripples."
If even seeking fortune at the onset of misfortune is inadvisable, how much more so at the beginning of calamity?
Responding when stirred, moving when pressed—this speaks of unavoidable response to things, a response born of non-attachment, though active, it is *non-action*.
Discard knowledge and constancy, and one is without knowledge or affairs; follow Heaven’s principle, and one accords with the natural.
With no celestial disasters, the burdens of things are naturally avoided.
With no human reproach, how could spectral blame arise?
Thus, one drifts in life and rests in death, thoughts severed and schemes abandoned—like jade containing virtue, like Heaven’s seasons following their course.
Sleeping without dreams, waking without care; spirit pure, soul untroubled—this is called emptiness, nothingness, tranquility, and blandness, aligning with the virtue of the natural.

The heart is like a target; emotions are like arrows. When many arrows aim at one target, how could the target not be struck?
Now, men stand in the midst of the world yet do not think to dodge the arrows—hoping for wholeness of virtue and an unharmed spirit, how difficult!
Thus it is said: The body wearies without rest and becomes worn; essence is expended without cease and becomes labored; labor leads to exhaustion.
Water’s nature is clear when unadulterated, level when undisturbed; if dammed and not flowing, it cannot remain clear—this is the image of Heaven’s virtue.
Thus it is said: Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, bland and *non-acting*, moving in accord with Heaven’s course—this is the way to nourish the spirit.

As for the swords of Gan and Yue, encased and stored away, never dared to be used—this is the utmost in treasuring them.
The spirit flows in all four directions, reaching everywhere, above touching Heaven, below coiling upon the earth, transforming and nurturing the myriad things, beyond representation—its name is "unity with the Divine."

The Way of purity and simplicity is to guard only the spirit; guard it without losing it, and unite with the spirit as one. When this oneness penetrates with precision, it harmonizes with Heaven’s order.

A rustic saying goes: The common crowd values profit, the incorruptible value reputation, the worthy esteem aspiration, and the sage treasures essence. Thus, "simplicity" means having nothing mixed with it; "purity" means not diminishing one’s spirit. One who embodies purity and simplicity is called a *zhenren*—a true person.

Guo’s commentary: All things have their proper place and must not be lost. Those who emulate Heaven’s virtue act without intention yet meet all things perfectly, never straying from what is most fitting. They dwell constantly in what is right, moving only in accord with the meeting. To chase and act is merely human conduct. One who cherishes a sword still stores it in its case—how much more should one dare to lightly use one’s spirit?

To embody the ultimate of Heaven and Earth, responding to the patterns of the myriad things with one’s spirit, is inherently like this: those who achieve the work of Heaven and Earth do so by following Heaven’s course, not by reckless use. Their nurturing knows no bounds, aligning with the Heavenly Emperor’s non-action. By constantly guarding purity and simplicity in utmost stillness without being swayed by externals, they enter the realm of the profound.

Essence is the true nature of things. To unite with the spirit is not merely to guard it; to not stray from one’s essence is not merely to treasure it—yet in practice, one must value and uphold it. If purity is defined as non-diminishment, then even if a hundred deeds are performed in unison and ten thousand transformations are mastered, one may still attain purity. If simplicity is defined as non-adulteration, then even if one possesses the splendor of dragons and phoenixes, an extraordinary sight, one may still attain simplicity. But if one cannot preserve one’s natural state and instead mixes it with external adornments, then even the coarse garments of dogs and sheep—how could they be called pure and simple?

Lü’s commentary: Observe the sage’s mind—empty, tranquil, and expansive. As previously stated, though one may engage in affairs all day, the spirit does not weary. The ancients spoke of setting aside the mind and employing the body, of seeing and hearing without relying on the eyes and ears—this is the way. Now, people bind their ears and eyes to sounds and sights, enslave their minds to pursuit and conformity, wearying the body without rest and expending essence without cease, leading inevitably to exhaustion and depletion.

Water’s nature is inherently clear and level—this is its natural straightness. It remains unadulterated and undisturbed, that is all. To know this yet mistake stagnation for stillness is to fail to keep it clear. The image of Heaven’s virtue is just the same. Thus, purity without admixture is the image of water’s clarity; stillness and oneness without change is the image of water’s levelness. Moving in accord with Heaven’s course is the image of water not mistaking stagnation for stillness.

Yet the world, in its vast diversity, imposes restraints on emptiness and stillness without knowing to observe the return amid activity or to return to the root amid the teeming—this is because they do not know the Way of nourishing the spirit. People of the world believe that nourishing the body is sufficient to preserve life, yet this is not enough to compare with it.

A sword is stored in its case because of its usefulness. The spirit reaches Heaven above and coils upon the Earth below—its usefulness far surpasses that of the swords of Gan and Yue! Its name is "unity with the Divine"—how could its value be merely that of a treasured sword? Yet they do not know to hone it with purity, store it with stillness, conceal it with non-action, and guide it with Heaven’s course—this is to fail to understand the distinction between what is noble and what is base.

Guard only the spirit, and guard it with purity and simplicity. While one is in the act of guarding, there is what is called "the guardian" and what is guarded. Guard without losing it, and the guardian and the guarded merge into one. "Order" here means principle. When a person harmonizes with Heaven’s principle, they too become Heaven.

This is why the sage treasures essence. Simplicity is absence of admixture; purity is non-diminishment. Only the true person can achieve this.

Yi Du’s commentary: The body must not be overworked; essence must not be overused. When the body is enslaved to essence, essence enters the spirit. When it reaches the spirit, transformation lies within oneself—one can transcend life and death. How could this be the labor of the body or the expenditure of essence?

Clarity can be washed; levelness can be emulated. Its ceaseless flow day and night is water’s nature. To embody the virtue of the natural and not drift into artificial contrivance is to remain unadulterated and unchanging, moving in accord with Heaven’s course.

Purity without constraint is how one exhausts principle. Stillness and oneness without change are how one fulfills one’s nature. Blandness and non-action are how one establishes the root. Movement in accord with Heaven’s course is how one follows the seasons. The Way of nourishing the body is complete.

The famed swords of Gan and Yue are all considered divine—stored in their cases and never dared to be used. Yet when it comes to the body, people do not know how to treasure it. Is it that they love their bodies less than their swords? No—it is simply that they do not reflect.

A sword is the treasure of a tool; the spirit is the treasure of the body. The treasure of a tool, when used, can only overcome a single foe. The treasure of the body, when concealed, can flow without end. In nurturing the myriad things—what the *Yi* calls "curving to complete without omission"—it cannot be represented, what is called "the spirit having no fixed form." Its name as "unity with the Divine" is but a forced designation.

To guard the spirit is to aim for the spirit. When one reaches the spirit, one unites with it, and purity and simplicity are no longer sufficient to describe it. When the oneness of essence penetrates, it harmonizes with the principle of the natural.

Again, rustic sayings are cited to affirm this: The sage treasures essence, and essence enters the spirit. What one embodies is purity and simplicity, but its function is merely the spirit. This is what is called a true person.

Bi Xu’s commentary: The body wearies and essence is expended when one exceeds one’s measure and harms one’s nature. Water’s nature is clear when unadulterated and level when undisturbed. The true water within the body is the same—if one is pure, still, and moves in accord with Heaven’s principle, though one does not refine the body, the spirit already reigns supreme.

A sharp sword is an external thing, yet one knows to treasure the spirit. To be swayed and scattered without gathering oneself—is this not a reversal of priorities?

One skilled in nurturing and guiding may accompany the workings of creation; one adept at preserving simplicity safeguards and maintains spirit and qi. Thus, they merge into profound unity and penetrate Heaven’s principle.

Rustic sayings list four matters, with treasuring essence as foremost: emptying the numinous palace and sealing the six apertures. When substance is unstained by dust, it is simplicity; when spirit is unagitated by affairs, it is purity. One whose embodiment is complete in purity and simplicity—how could this not be the true person?

Yongzhai observes: Using water as a metaphor for nurturing life, if it is pent up and cannot clear, it is not entirely like withered wood or dead ashes. "Unadulterated and undisturbed"—this is nonaction. "Not flowing and thus unable to clear"—within nonaction there is action. Does not Heaven’s movement, completing one cycle each day, exemplify action within nonaction? To nurture spirit is to nurture life; to lift up the word "spirit" is to make it intimate. One who cherishes a sword still keeps it sheathed—how much more should one treasure spirit? This same spirit transforms and nourishes the myriad things, yet leaves no trace visible, so its merit is equal to that of Heaven’s Lord.

For those who study purity and simplicity, at first they guard only spirit; with time, they become one with spirit. This is what is meant by "transforming through greatness." Before transformation, one remains separate from the Dao. When unity reaches the point of penetrating essence, one merges with Heaven’s principle—this is what is called "sagely and unknowable."

To treasure essence is to treasure spirit. Purity and simplicity are the "pure and unsullied" of *Qian*. The true person, the perfected person, the sage—these are not matters of superiority or inferiority. *Carving Intentions* speaks of nurturing spirit and includes the discourse on Heaven’s movement and the transformation of things; *Mending Nature* speaks of preserving the body and includes the discussion of time, fate, action, and error. Though nurturing spirit and preserving the body are treated in two separate chapters, this is where the work of learning lies, and scholars must examine it closely.

The Dao of nurturing spirit values nonaction, hence the analogy of water’s clarity—level, still, and ever-illuminating. When it moves, it models Heaven’s ceaseless vigor, coiling between the two poles. Yet this is fundamentally rooted in nonattachment, nonalteration, and nonaction—this is illumination within constant stillness. When essence is expended, it wearies and depletes; thus stillness is prized. When pent up and unable to clear, it requires movement. Yet within the realm of neither stillness nor motion, neither attachment nor detachment, the wondrous Dao abides. How could its value be merely that of a treasured sword from Gan or Yue?

To be one with the Lord is to be one with Heaven. Heaven is spirit. Thus, when essence penetrates and merges with Heaven’s principle, here one can no longer distinguish between the Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humanity. The passage concludes by citing rustic sayings as proof, returning to the treasuring of essence and affirming that one who embodies purity and simplicity will transform entirely. Who but the true person can attain this?

This chapter takes "Carving Intent" as its title, speaking of those who sharpen their will, defy the world, and correct customs through austere discipline and solitary resolve—attempting what all under Heaven cannot, and coveting others’ allegiance. This is no different from piercing an ox’s nose or bridling a horse’s head, losing their natural state. When wisdom grows long, virtue wanes, and the people become hard to govern.

Thus, the *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi] surveys the ancients, each with distinct aspirations: Bo Yi and Shu Qi’s defiance, Confucius and Mencius’ cultivation, Yi Yin and Fu Yue’s governance, Chao Fu and Xu You’s reclusion, Laozi and Peng Zu’s longevity. Viewed broadly, none seem without bias, yet they remain sages and worthies because their actions do not entangle them in doing, nor does their non-doing drown them in nothingness. They adapt to the times’ feasibility and their own advantage.

Therefore, what is prized is emptiness, non-doing, tranquility, and ease—aligning with Heaven’s movement and the transformations of things, sharing virtue and riding the same current. When knowledge and habit do not linger, and movement accords with Heaven’s principle, how could calamity or trouble arise? How could life and death or schemes and cares disturb one’s clarity?

Thus, in stillness, emptiness, and pure simplicity, one harmonizes with things without conflict, ultimately returning to the work of nurturing the spirit. The analogy of sheathing the treasured swords of Gan and Yue is extended: what weight does a sword hold for the body? Its rejection or acceptance is self-evident. Yet the world remains deluded in this regard. Hence, the argument begins by rejecting the habit of carving intent and exalting conduct, and concludes by affirming that one who embodies purity and simplicity is a true person—making it clear that those who carve and exalt are but counterfeits.

For nurturing life, purity and simplicity are the foundation; for purity and simplicity, guarding the spirit comes first. When one unites with the spirit, the great root of the Dao is established—what need is there to fuss over its branches by carving intent and exalting conduct?

The *Nanhua* speaks thus to correct the false habits of scholars of its time, guiding them to rest in the naturalness of their nature and destiny and return to the purity and simplicity of the Dao and virtue.

*Collected Explications of the Ocean of Meanings in the True Classic of Nanhua*, Scroll 48, concludes.
#1 The *Omissions and Errors* cites Zhang Junfang’s edition, where "resting in rest" (*xiu xiu yan*) appears as "resting in it" (*xiu yan xiu*). Yu Yue’s *Zhuangzi Pingyi* argues that the two characters "resting in it" (*xiu yan*) were transposed in transmission.

**Cultivating Nature, Part One**

To cultivate nature through convention is to seek the recovery of one’s origin by means of vulgar learning. To muddy desire with conventional thought and strive for clarity through reflection is to be called a people benighted and deluded.

Those of old who governed the Way nurtured knowledge with tranquility. Born without making knowledge their aim, they were said to nurture tranquility with knowledge. Knowledge and tranquility mutually nourished one another, and harmony and principle emerged from their nature.

Virtue is harmony; the Dao is principle. Virtue admits of no exclusion—this is benevolence. The Dao leaves nothing unordered—this is righteousness. Righteousness made manifest, things draw near—this is loyalty. Centered in purity and returning to genuine feeling—this is joy. Trust embodied in conduct and form, following patterned refinement—this is ritual.

When ritual and music are practiced in a partial manner, the world falls into chaos. Those who rectify themselves yet obscure their own virtue do not impose it; if they impose it, things inevitably lose their nature.

**Guo’s Annotation:**
To cultivate one’s nature through convention and seek to restore the root of life and destiny by vulgar learning is to pursue what is ever further from the Way. To disorder the mind with desire and then employ thought in striving for clarity is to stray ever further the more one refines one’s thinking. Those who dispel delusion must first depart from convention and abandon desire before approaching the threshold. Only when tranquility is attained does knowledge not stray; when knowledge does not stray, nature is not lost. To act without making knowledge one’s aim and instead allow it to know of itself is to know all things while remaining serene and self-content. Knowledge that is not contrived does no harm to tranquility; tranquility that acts of itself does no injury to knowledge. When these two mutually nourish one another, how could harmony and principle arise from anything else?

Harmony ensures nothing is left unfulfilled; the Dao ensures nothing is left unordered. That which admits of no exclusion is not benevolence by design, yet the traces of benevolence unfold. That which leaves nothing unordered is not righteousness by design, yet the work of righteousness is manifest. If righteousness is made manifest yet does not arise from the center, things grow ever more distant. When benevolence and righteousness issue from the center and return to one’s original disposition, the will is fulfilled, and when the will is fulfilled, joy arises. Trust embodied in conduct and form, following patterned refinement—its outward trace is ritual.

To impose the practice of one body or the joy of one will upon the world is for one region to gain while ten thousand lose. When each rectifies its nature and life and veils itself in its own virtue, it does not impose this upon that. If one imposes this upon that, how can things not lose their nature?

**Lü’s Annotation:**
To cultivate nature through convention is to rest one’s aspirations in the mundane. Born and already having lost one’s origin, to then seek its recovery through vulgar learning is to stray ever further. To muddy desire with convention is to court peril in chasing after conformity, confounding one’s clarity, and then striving to attain it through thought is to grow ever more benighted.

Tranquility is to be at ease without knowing why. To nurture knowledge with this is not to strive for clarity through thought. To be born with knowledge yet not make it one’s aim or employ it is different from being at ease without knowing why. To nurture tranquility with this is not to seek the recovery of one’s origin through vulgar learning. The divine clarity of the *Book of Changes*, the "elusive and evanescent" of Laozi, and the tranquility and knowledge of *Zhuangzi*—in truth, they are one. Those of old who governed the Way never attained their end without mutually nourishing these two.

The flaw in tranquility lies in obscurity, leaving nothing to illumine the vast and open. The flaw in knowledge lies in entanglement, leaving nothing to return to the primal darkness. When these two mutually nourish one another, harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature—not from without.

That which pervades Heaven and Earth is virtue. Virtue is harmony. That which courses through the ten thousand things is the Dao. The Dao is principle. The essence of virtue is harmony, and its function admits of no exclusion—this is benevolence. The essence of the Dao is principle, and its function leaves nothing unordered—this is righteousness. Righteousness made manifest, things cannot but draw near—this is the center. Centered in purity and free from artifice, joy is born from this. Trust is to have it within and manifest it without, giving rise to patterned refinement—this is ritual.

When ritual is thin, it is the beginning of disorder. When the ten thousand things each rectify their nature and life, they veil themselves in their own virtue. What need has virtue to impose itself upon others? When ritual and music are practiced universally, the Dao and virtue grow ever more distant, and imposition cannot be avoided. Imposition causes things to lose their nature—this is why the world falls into chaos.

**Yi Du’s Annotation:**
The true person of old did not cultivate nature through convention but embraced simplicity, thereby recovering their original state. They did not muddy desire with convention but refined their thought to penetrate the Dao, thereby attaining clarity. How could they be benighted or deluded?

Only by cultivating nature through convention does one contend in artifice, and then seek the recovery of one’s origin through vulgar learning. Only by muddying desire with convention does one chase after emotion, and then employ thought to govern one’s clarity—all in vain.

To recover one’s origin is to fulfill one’s nature. To attain clarity is to reach destiny. The origin is where things have yet to arise; clarity is where the Dao is seen. Tranquility is ease; ease is stillness; stillness is knowledge; knowledge is movement. Movement and stillness mutually sustain one another. Thus, knowledge and tranquility mutually nourish one another, and harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature.

Harmony arises from what is so of itself—this is called virtue. Principle arises from spontaneity—this is called the Dao. Virtue is attained within, hence nothing is excluded—this is called boundless love. The Dao disperses through things, hence nothing is left unordered—this is called things finding their proper place.

To have capacity is to be benevolent; to have principle is to be righteous. Righteousness made manifest, things draw near—this is to show one’s lack of deceit. Loyalty is the absence of deceit. Benevolence suffices to embrace; righteousness suffices to order; loyalty suffices to draw things near. Then supreme joy arises within, and patterned refinement is manifest without.

Yet when ritual and music are practiced universally, the world falls into chaos. Those who rectify themselves yet veil their own virtue are sages. The virtue of the sage does not deliberately cover the world, yet the things of the world each rectify their nature. If one forcibly imposes virtue to cover them, things will lose their nature!

**Xiang Dao’s Annotation:**
At birth, humans are still—this is the nature of Heaven.

When things stir the senses, movement arises—this is the desire of human nature. What nature fundamentally is, is authenticity; what desire fundamentally values, is correctness. Now, if one refines one’s nature through worldly customs, authenticity is submerged in falsity, and if one seeks to restore one’s original nature through worldly learning, the more one learns, the more one loses one’s nature. If one muddies desire with worldly customs, correctness is drowned in depravity, and if one exhausts thought to attain clarity, the more one thinks, the more one’s will becomes confused.

Those who cultivated the Dao in ancient times did not act thus. They nurtured knowledge with tranquility, and so could govern their clarity and penetrate all principles. They nurtured tranquility with knowledge, and so could restore their original nature and exhaust all its potential. Nature is the root of knowledge and tranquility; harmonious order is their function. When knowledge and tranquility mutually nurture each other, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music merge into the Dao and virtue. When knowledge and tranquility mutually lose each other, the Dao and virtue branch into benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music. Now, righteousness emerges from virtue, and principle emerges from the Dao—these are already diminished. How much more so when music emerges from benevolence and ritual from righteousness?

**Bixu’s Annotation:**
To stand in the road and avoid filth, to dwell in impurity yet seek reflection—what is this if not obscuration? Restlessness and competition only bring confusion; tranquility and stillness yield knowledge. When knowledge is not enslaved, one preserves stillness well. When knowledge is not employed, one can thus harmonize. When tranquility is naturally preserved, one thus attains order. Though one may borrow cultivation and practice, the root lies in natural self-attainment, and so one can harmonize self and others and, being unobstructed, govern things. Supreme benevolence is one with virtue, taking containment as its root; supreme righteousness is one with the Dao, taking unobstructed order as its source. To abide in harmony without excess is music; to regulate appearance and conform to measure is ritual. Ritual responds to things; music rectifies nature. Self-restraint preserves authenticity; leading others brings chaos. Those who rectify themselves veil their own virtue, and when virtue is firmly established, they guard tranquility without imposition—this is how each rectifies their nature and life, with tranquility and knowledge mutually nurturing.

**Yongzhai’s Note:**
"Refining nature with worldly learning" criticizes the Confucian and Mohist discourses on nature of the time. To cultivate nature with worldly learning in order to restore its original state, or to be muddied by profit and desire yet seek to attain a state of emptiness and clarity—this is the height of folly and ignorance. Stillness gives rise to wisdom, hence "nurturing knowledge with tranquility." When one knows that one’s original nature is without things, how can knowledge be employed? Only then can one attain stillness, hence "nurturing tranquility with knowledge." When the two mutually nurture each other, one then recovers one’s natural nature. "Harmonious order" means harmony and compliance, attaining one’s original harmonious and compliant nature through stillness and stability. The six characters "nurturing knowledge with tranquility, nurturing tranquility with knowledge" are most profound—Dao and virtue are precisely this harmony. To be all-embracing is to be all-loving; to be all-ordering is to let each attain its proper place. When righteousness is made manifest and things draw near, this is exhausting oneself—what is called loyalty. When the center’s authenticity and purity are outwardly expressed, and one seeks within the center what is expressed, this is joy arising, and once arisen, how can it cease? To trust in the conduct of one’s body and have natural refinement is to move in accord with ritual. To seek ritual and music externally without knowing their root is called "partial conduct," for one sees only half.

"Veiling" means obscuring. When virtue accumulates, others naturally rectify themselves. "Not imposing" means I do not apply virtue to others; imposition causes things to lose their nature. All explanations rely on worldly learning, but Chen Bixu, following Zhang Junfang’s collated edition, omits the character for "worldly" before "learning," making the meaning clear: nature is fundamentally natural and does not rely on cultivation. Today’s scholars value reputation and worldly approval, which is refining nature through custom. Yet they still painstakingly advance in learning to restore nature’s original state—broad but without focus, authenticity is lost all the more! Indulging in likes and dislikes, sinking into delusion without return—this is muddying desire with custom. Yet they still exhaust thought and contemplate minutely to attain clarity—knowledge is depleted and effort is wasted, and clarity becomes ever more distant!

Generally, unless one is endowed by Heaven with exceptional talent, one cannot be without learning; learning serves to nurture nature. Heaven bestows wisdom, illuminating with the achievements of the ancients, imprinting what is shared in my heart, aiming only to return to simplicity and restore the root—this is not to carve holes in people to increase their knowledge and augment their miscellaneous poisons. Human nature is fundamentally without evil, yet cannot be without desire. Following nature with the Dao, desire arises correctly, as in hunger and thirst, cold and fatigue, clothing and rest. Refining nature through custom, desire arises from depravity, as in craving fine food and rich drink, splendid clothing, and unrestrained repose. When desire enters depravity, nature loses its goodness, sinking into worldly custom and drifting ever farther from the Dao!

The Dao values tranquility and magnanimity; the world values ostentation and competition. Learning is not true learning; thought is not true thought—this is how the human mind and the mind of the Dao diverge, and how supreme goodness and great evil arise. Only by cutting off learning and thought can one restore nature’s original state and attain clarity. Why, then, does one pursue external learning to adulterate it and employ reckless thought to obstruct it? Thus, learning is said to obscure and authenticity to diminish; thought is said to trouble and the Dao to recede—this is what the true person laments!

As for those who preserve their natural nature without being refined by custom, they originally do not seek to restore it yet restore it; those who preserve the correctness of their desires without being muddied by custom originally do not seek clarity yet attain it. Only when the Dao gathers in emptiness is this so.

The *Analects* says, "Learning without thought is blindness; thought without learning is perilous." Learning and thought are what the sage and worthy rely on for cultivation—why does the *Nanhua* reject them? It is because the worthy take inner learning as learning and near thought as thought, while the sage takes the cessation of learning as learning and the absence of thought as thought—this is how they differ from the worldly learning of broad knowledge and extensive erudition.

From inner learning to the cessation of learning, from near thought to the absence of thought—here the sage’s and worthy’s capacities are complete!

Tranquility governs stillness; awareness governs movement. Stillness engenders moisture; movement engenders heat. When heat and moisture attain the mean, harmony and principle emerge. Harmony is the essence of virtue; principle is the fittingness of affairs. Both reside within our nature—they are not imposed from without.

The worldly know that tranquility cannot mutually nurture, so movement and stillness become partial. Profit and harm grind against each other, kindling a fire that scorches harmony, and true nature is diminished. Only those who cultivate the Way keep movement and stillness within the bounds of the Dao, responding to things without hoarding. They preserve tranquility to nurture awareness, yet when awareness arises, they do not employ it—thus nurturing tranquility in turn. When nature reaches harmony and affairs fulfill their principle, the harmony of heaven and earth responds. This is the clear proof of cultivating the self to order the world.

Later, [scholars] elaborated on *ren*, *yi*, loyalty, ritual, and music. The character *zhong* (loyalty) is discussed in detail in Guo Xiang’s commentary and Cheng Xuanying’s subcommentary—all should be understood as belonging to this mean.

When governance of the Way descends to exalting ritual and music, it grows ever more base, thus inviting disorder. Ritual and music do not themselves disorder the world; rather, those who follow them cannot avoid disorder—such is the force of circumstance.

If one could ascend from ritual and music to *ren* and *yi*, and from *ren* and *yi* return to the Dao and virtue, this would be the means to quell calamity and attain the safeguard of grand peace!

In ancient times, people dwelled in primordial chaos, yet with their age they attained serene indifference. In that era, yin and yang harmonized in stillness; ghosts and spirits did not disturb; the four seasons kept their rhythm; the myriad things were unharmed; the multitudes did not die young. Though humans possessed knowledge, they had no use for it. This was called "supreme unity."

At that time, none acted yet all was constantly spontaneous. When virtue later declined, Sui Ren and Fu Xi began to rule the world—thus compliance arose, yet unity was lost. When virtue declined further, Shen Nong and the Yellow Emperor began to rule the world—thus stability arose, yet compliance was lost. When virtue declined still further, Yao and Shun began to rule the world, initiating the currents of governance and transformation. They diluted purity and scattered simplicity, departing from the Dao to pursue goodness, risking virtue to enact conduct. Only then did they abandon nature to follow the heart.

Hearts vied with hearts in discernment, yet this was insufficient to settle the world. Thus they appended culture and augmented it with breadth. Culture extinguished substance; breadth drowned the heart. Then the people grew confused and disordered, unable to return to their nature and restore their origin.

Guo’s commentary: "Entrusting to spontaneity, thus attaining supreme unity." The decline of virtue stems from sages not succeeding one another. Those in power could not practice non-action yet coveted the legacy of non-action, thus bringing about corruption.

The world had already lost unity; confusion could not be resolved, so they let go and did not pursue it, contenting themselves with what was settled. Sages could entrust the world to its own attainment—how could they make the world attain sageliness! Thus the paths of emperors and kings shifted with the age, yet the Way of the sage remained ever whole.

"Goodness" is a term that exceeds what is fitting—there is goodness, yet the Dao is not whole. "Conduct" is acting contrary to nature—conduct is established, yet virtue is not level. When the heart enslaves itself, nature departs. When hearts compete to be first in discernment, there is no longer any entrusting to nature. Forgetting knowledge and entrusting to nature—only then is there stability.

Culture and breadth are adornments of the heart’s substance. The origin is the root of nature and destiny.

Lü’s commentary: What is called "dwelling in primordial chaos and attaining serene indifference" refers to the wondrous state of supreme unity in the eras of Sui Ren and Fu Xi. The various sages were but coarse elaborations of primordial chaos and serene indifference.

Viewed from that wondrous state, to go among the world with the Dao and cause the people to be without knowledge or desire is called "supreme unity"—and rightly so. Viewed from those coarse elaborations, though all ruled the world, their virtue could not avoid decline and did not emerge from supreme unity. Thus those who practice the Dao constantly reject sageliness and discard knowledge, returning to nothingness.

Yet this chapter’s discussion reaches this point precisely because, in the time of supreme unity, even Sui Ren, Fu Xi, and the Yellow Emperor could not find a place within its inquiry. Those who study the sages’ words and their elaborations, unaware that within themselves lies the capacity to set the myriad things in motion without sharing the sages’ anxieties—when they hear these words and react with shock, doubt, laughter, or astonishment, it is hardly surprising.

From Sui Ren to Yao and Shun, the currents of governance and transformation diluted purity and scattered simplicity. The responses varied in depth, as the saying goes: "When the great Dao is abandoned, there is *ren* and *yi*. When knowledge and wisdom emerge, there is great falsity."

The Dao is without un-goodness; if there is what is called "goodness," it does not accord. Virtue has no conduct; if there is what is called "conduct," it is not level. *Ren* is the chief of goodness; *yi* is the means by which it is enacted. When the Dao and virtue are risked, this is abandoning nature to follow the heart.

When transformation gives rise to desire, I would quell it with the nameless uncarved block. Now, to settle the world’s hearts with the heart—hearts vie in discernment yet remain insufficient to settle the world. Thus they append culture and extinguish substance, augment with breadth and drown the heart.

Culture is ritual and music; breadth is learning. Substance is nature. When ritual and music are enacted, the world is disordered. How can one seek to restore the origin and attain clarity?

Du’s annotation: From "people dwelled in primordial chaos" to "this was called supreme unity"—this meaning has appeared repeatedly above and will not be explained again.

Sui Ren altered fire; Fu Xi instituted culture, thus beginning the heart that acts for the world. Though they could comply with human hearts, they could not make them one, as in the age of primordial chaos. Shen Nong attacked Gong Gong; the Yellow Emperor battled Chi You—though their intent was to pacify the people, they were no longer compliant with the multitudes. Yao harmonized the hundred clans; Shun exiled the Four Villains—here began the currents of governance and transformation.

Thus, Confucius began his *Book of Documents* with the Tang and Yu dynasties. Goodness is the dispersion of the Dao, a path that people can trace and a practice they can follow. Yet when virtue becomes perilous and conduct becomes level, one abandons nature to follow the heart—and that heart, too, arises. When hearts recognize one another, distinctions forcibly emerge. To take knowledge as knowing is thus insufficient to settle the world.

When refinement prevails, substance perishes; when erudition accumulates, the heart labors. The people begin to grow confused and disordered, unable to return to their nature and feelings.

Du’s annotation: When one is whole in the Dao, there is nothing to comply with. Compliance is compliance with things, and without compliance, there is no rest. Without rest, there is no disorder. The loss of wholeness leads to compliance; the loss of compliance leads to rest; the loss of rest leads to disorder. From the ancients, three descents brought us to the Tang and Yu dynasties, where the people first grew confused and restless. Without means to return to their nature and feelings, they were not compliant; without means to restore their origin, they were not whole.

The Dao originally continues goodness, yet in practice, though one may act with virtue, it is perilous. Nature is the realm of the heart; the heart is the ruler of nature. Nature is never not tranquil, yet the heart may move it. What is tranquil is never not pure, yet what moves it severs it.

Those who are adept in the Dao preserve the heart to nurture nature. Those who are inept abandon nature to follow the heart, so that their hearts and others’ contend, vying to be first in recognition, grasping at right and wrong, weighing profit and harm—how far they have strayed from the Dao! What can such petty knowledge do to settle the world?

When knowledge is deemed insufficient to settle the world, one then clings to refinement to adorn substance, only to extinguish substance; one adds erudition to guide the heart, only to exhaust the heart. This is like raising dust to halt dust or fanning the wind to quench flames—how could the world not grow confused and disordered?

Bixu’s annotation: In the age of supreme virtue, there was unadorned simplicity and no knowledge, serene indifference and no desire—thus, all was pure and whole. Sui Ren drilled fire; Fu Xi drew the trigrams. To comply with the feelings of things is no longer to be whole. Shen Nong wielded the plow; the Yellow Emperor brandished weapons. To have something to rest in is no longer to be compliant. Yao campaigned against Dan Shui; Shun attacked the You Miao—thus, simplicity scattered.

To do good is to draw near to fame, to depart from the Dao. To act alone harms life, to make virtue perilous. To abandon the profound tranquility of nature and follow the heart one has cultivated, to measure heart with heart, to contend in prior recognition—this is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of folly. Thus, it is known that knowledge is insufficient to settle the world.

Serenity can nurture the myriad things; in the Dao, substance endures. To cut off learning is to still the heart; to discard knowledge is to return to the root; to practice non-action is to restore the origin.

Master Yongzhai observes: "Primal chaos" signifies concealment without self-revelation. "Vast stillness" means that above and below do not seek one another. When the world is wholly complete, nothing is lacking in the Dao, and daily it approaches oneness. To know there is a principle to follow is already to depart from pure oneness. When each person takes principle as their resting place, they assert the self and stray from the Dao.

The name of goodness only distances one further from the Way. Where conduct is visible, virtue is no longer balanced. To abandon the nature of spontaneity and follow the heart of deliberate action—when I act with intent and others respond in kind—is for heart to scrutinize heart. Knowledge is insufficient, and when augmented by ritual, music, and cultural refinement, to fix the mind upon these is to sink into drowning.

Spirits guard their depths; the myriad things fulfill their natures. As for humans, to possess knowledge yet not employ it—is this not to attain primal chaos and vast stillness? Can this be so? This is called "supreme oneness," for in high antiquity the ruler’s virtue was truly pure, and the people’s hearts knew no division.

When virtue declined, there arose those who opposed it, and thus to make harmonizing the world one’s aim was already to depart from supreme oneness. When there arose those who disturbed it, to make pacifying the world one’s aim was to violate true nature. Descending to the eras of Tang and Yu, governance and transformation dissolved simplicity, and departing from the Dao and virtue, they practiced good conduct—thus receding ever further from nature.

To measure heart with heart? Knowledge is insufficient, and when supplemented with literary embellishment, it is like embracing kindling to quench fire. If one cannot even attain one’s own nature and emotions, what can one do for the world?

The *Nanhua* discusses the age of Tang and Yu as already so far removed from the Dao. In high antiquity, simplicity was like that of an infant; next came the ability to speak and laugh, with joy and anger; from then on, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight intermingled within, while deceit, cunning, and treachery manifested in form. To hope for a return to simplicity and the restoration of uncarved purity—is this not difficult?

Now, desiring to clarify the source and purify the stream, one cites Suiren and Fuxi as examples of virtue in decline. What is longed for is to elevate the people above high antiquity, to a state of possessing virtue without rank—how lamentable!

**Cultivating Nature, Part Two**

From this perspective, the world has lost the Dao, and the Dao has lost the world—world and Dao mutually perish. How can the person of Dao arise in the world, and how can the world arise in the Dao? If the Dao cannot arise in the world, and the world cannot arise in the Dao, then even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, his virtue remains hidden. Hidden, yet not by his own concealment.

The ancients spoke of "recluses" not as those who crouch in concealment and remain unseen, nor as those who seal their words and refuse to speak, nor as those who hoard their knowledge and withhold it—rather, their time and fate were greatly awry. Had their time and fate aligned to flourish throughout the world, they would have returned to unity without leaving a trace. Had their time and fate been utterly thwarted in the world, they would have deeply rooted themselves, stabilized their essence, and awaited the turning—this is the way to preserve the self.

Guo’s commentary: The Dao, being without esteem, can thus endure in the world. Yet if the world endures, it esteems the Dao; once esteemed, the Dao is lost. The Dao cannot prevent the world from esteeming it, nor can the world refrain from esteeming the Dao—thus they mutually perish. Were there no esteem, they would mutually arise. The reason one does not conceal oneself now is due to the emotions that spur mutual arising. How does this arise? Through the absence of esteem.

None know to return to unity and still the paths, yet they chase traces to seek unity—striving further, they lose unity all the more. This is the greatest error! Even if one rises to clarify it, opens speech to express it, or displays knowledge to reveal it, how can mutual arising occur? When time and fate flourish, this is the time of tranquil indifference, where one follows the nature of things, and their nature unifies of itself—thus there are no bounds. When time and fate are thwarted, this is a time that cannot be tranquil, yet even in a world of affairs, the sage never fails to remain indifferent, deeply rooting and stabilizing essence to await its natural course. This is how the Dao is not lost—there has never been a case where the self endured and the world did not flourish.

Lü’s commentary: When world and Dao mutually arise, the sage acts and all things behold him. When world and Dao mutually perish, the sage wanders amidst the common world yet remains unknown—he is already hidden; why would he conceal himself in the mountains and forests? Returning to unity without trace is like the dream of Huaxu or the wanderings of Gushe. Deeply rooting and stabilizing essence is like the unshakable firmness of the unyielding. The way the dragon and snake endure through adversity is no different.

Observing Zhuangzi’s words, one senses his lament over the misalignment of time and fate. When world and Dao mutually perish, it is indeed cause for sorrow. Those who hear the Dao, encountering the flux of rise and fall, must know how to preserve the self. Yet Zhuangzi, who does not share the sage’s concerns, why would he lament amidst such great error?

Yi Zhu’s commentary: Dwelling in antiquity while practicing the Dao of today—this is the Dao losing the world. Dwelling in the present while practicing the Dao of antiquity—this is the world losing the Dao. Only with this world can this Dao be practiced; otherwise, world and Dao merely perish together. The Dao cannot arise in the world—this is fate. The world cannot arise in the Dao—this is the time. When time and fate are at odds, even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, his virtue remains hidden, as with Liezi in the Zheng gardens or Zhuangzi in the Lacquer Orchard.

To be hidden is to conceal one’s virtue. To conceal oneself is to hide one’s form. Chang Ju and Jie Ni were those who concealed their forms. The ancients’ recluses did not avoid land, avoid speech, or bind their knowledge—their time and fate were greatly awry, and they simply accepted it. When their time and fate aligned and their Dao flourished throughout the world, the sage never considered himself successful, returning to unity without displaying traces to others. When their time and fate were thwarted and their Dao was utterly obstructed in the world, the sage never considered himself impoverished, deeply rooting his foundation and stabilizing his essence. This is what Mencius meant by "great success does not augment, and reclusion does not diminish."

Unity is the essence of principle—only without striving can one enter the spiritual. The root is the fulfillment of nature—only by stabilizing essence can one reach destiny. The common people use it daily yet do not know it—this is what is meant by returning to unity without paths. A hundred generations await the sage without confusion—this is what is meant by deeply rooting, stabilizing essence, and awaiting it.

Detailed Dao commentary: The ancients knew that knowledge and tranquility nurtured each other—thus the Dao and the world could be understood. Today, world and Dao mutually perish—thus knowledge and tranquility can be understood. When the world loses the Dao, customs daily grow shallow. When the Dao loses the world, virtue daily declines. When the world cannot arise in the Dao, this is the time when heaven and earth are closed, and the worthy withdraw. Even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, he too will conceal himself—how much more so those beneath him?

The ancients’ "recluses" did not mean those who crouch in concealment, seal their words, or hoard their knowledge—they were those whose bodies emerged yet whose hearts remained hidden, like the floating duckweed, distinct from those who befriend trees and stones or herd with birds and beasts. The scripture speaks of "when the world has the Dao, the sage completes it"—his work is accomplished through non-action, returning to unity without trace. "When the world lacks the Dao, the sage lives"—he preserves his nature and life through enduring existence, deeply rooting and stabilizing essence. Completing it without forgetting others through self, living without harming self through others—thus he sees poverty as prosperity, prosperity as poverty. His spirit does not gallop outward, his essence is not depleted within—is this not the way to preserve the self?

Bixu’s commentary: When people endure, the Dao flourishes; when people perish, the Dao is lost. The mutual perishing of world and Dao is the course of history. People and the world are the branches—their essence lies in the root. Thus, Lao Dan as the Archivist, Nanhua as the Keeper of the Lacquer Orchard—their virtue was hidden. Yet they did not conceal themselves; the times made it so.

Boyi gathering ferns, Zilong fishing—this was the great misalignment of time and fate.

Returning to the One leaves no trace, achieving success without claiming it. Fu Yue in his trowel-wall building, Lü Wang in his riverbank fishing—these were deeply rooting and stabilizing essence. Yongzhai said: When the Dao and the world mutually perish, how can those of the Dao arise to stir the world’s perceptions? And how can the world’s people come to know the Dao? If the world does not know the Dao, then even if the sage stands before them, the multitude will not recognize him. It is not that the sage deliberately conceals himself; rather, the reclusive scholar, wishing to conceal his person, silence his words, and hide his knowledge, knows the time is not right—this is what is meant by "when the state lacks the Dao, feign foolishness." Returning to the One leaves no trace, achieving success without possessing it. Though the Dao may be practiced, it is entrusted to things without intent; what lies within me is simply the One.

"Rooting deeply" means withdrawing and concealing in secrecy; "stabilizing essence" means "daily secure your abode"—preserving the self to await the time. Examining the phrase "the Dao and the world mutually perish," the sentiment is deeply lamentable. The true person transcends worldly entanglements, naturally not troubled by personal encounters or their absence; this is spoken for the sake of the world’s course, and is indeed a lament for others’ sorrow. Yet in its ultimate realization, there is something that can resolve this sorrow: if one can, in an instant, illuminate the truth with principle, then one may dwell in poverty as in prosperity, regard slander as success—what then are gain and loss?

The recluses of old, knowing the misalignment of time and fate, accepted it; thus their virtue was hidden, but their persons were not concealed. Though dwelling in chaotic times, they harmonized their light with the dust, and no harm could reach them. The recluses of today, fleeing to remote places, make their traces conspicuous, unsettled in what should be settled—some even act strangely to provoke conflict.

Returning to the One without trace makes the luminous Dao appear dim. Deeply rooting and stabilizing essence makes the skilled merchant seem empty. This is what is meant by "adapting to the times in concealment or revelation, able to be dragon or snake"—wherever this body goes, it is preserved; wherever the Dao abides, it cannot be absent. The *Wenzhongzi*’s distinction between "heavenly concealment" and "human concealment" originates here.

The ancients who preserved themselves did not adorn their knowledge with eloquence, did not exhaust the world with their wisdom, did not deplete their virtue with their knowledge. Solemnly abiding in their place, they returned to their nature—what more was there to do? The Dao is not fulfilled through petty actions; virtue is not perfected through petty understanding. Petty understanding harms virtue; petty actions harm the Dao. Thus it is said: "Rectify yourself, and that is all!" "Enjoying wholeness" is called "attaining one’s aspiration."

What the ancients called "attaining one’s aspiration" did not refer to carriages and caps of office; it meant that nothing could augment their joy. What is now called "attaining one’s aspiration" refers to carriages and caps. Yet when these are on the body, they are not one’s nature and life—such things come fortuitously, as a lodging. As a lodging, their coming cannot be warded off, nor their going halted. Thus one does not indulge one’s aspirations for carriages and caps, nor follow the vulgar in poverty and constraint—one’s joy is the same in both. Therefore, one is simply without sorrow. If the lodging departs, one is not joyful. From this perspective, though there may be joy, it is not without distraction. Thus it is said: "Those who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to the vulgar are called inverted people."

Guo’s commentary: Following one’s true knowledge, guarding one’s self-attainment, walking the level path, vast and unobstructed—attaining one’s aspiration, solitary and serene in heart without sorrow or joy: this is "enjoying wholeness." What is called "attaining one’s aspiration" is fulfilling one’s inner self and being sufficient; comings and goings belong to external things, gain and loss are not of the self. Indifferent and composed, one does not sense the lodging on the body; open and self-content, one does not know poverty in oneself. Thus there is no joy in hearing praise or fearing blame. If the lodging departs and one is not joyful, then when it comes, one is distracted. Seeking externals while harming the inner self—this is inversion.

Lü’s commentary: Preserving the self is simply stillness; conducting oneself is not merely stillness, but must respond to change without harming stillness—this is acceptable. Forgetting words, yet knowing all without knowing; abandoning knowledge, yet virtue is fully equipped. Solemnly abiding in one’s place, one need not flee the world or separate from things, for worldly things cannot burden one—this is the way of conducting oneself. The Dao is not fulfilled through petty actions; virtue is not perfected through petty understanding. Thus one does not slightly diminish oneself to follow the world; this is what is meant by "rectifying oneself." "Enjoying wholeness" means that nothing can augment one’s joy. Aspiring to the Dao and seeking its attainment—this is what is called "attaining one’s aspiration." The Dao is one’s nature and life; carriages and caps are but lodgings of things. If one exchanges the joy of having nothing to augment for the departure of this lodging, one loses oneself and forfeits one’s nature—this is inversion.

Yi Du’s commentary: Preserving the self pertains to fate, speaking of what is in Heaven; conducting oneself pertains to the Dao, speaking of what is in man. Not adorning knowledge with eloquence is true knowledge without knowing; not exhausting the world with wisdom is forgetting the world entirely; not depleting virtue with knowledge is virtue without virtue. When the Dao acts externally, it is great; when virtue has something to recognize, it is vast. Petty actions harm the Dao; petty understanding harms virtue. Rectifying oneself means that all things in the world take their correctness from me—how could petty understanding or actions compare?

Sorrow and joy arise from nature and life; the world cannot diminish or augment them—this is the wholeness of sorrow and joy. Shun grieved over not winning his parents’ favor, yet even the world’s wealth and honor could not diminish his sorrow; Yanzi rejoiced in his gourd bowl and ladle, yet even the world’s wealth and honor could not augment his joy. Beyond this, all is external to sorrow and joy. If joy is not wholly preserved, it is not enough to be called "attaining one’s aspiration"; if something seizes one’s aspiration, it is lost again.

Man in the world is a lodging; carriages and caps on the body are a lodging within a lodging. Worldly people cling to their bodies as if they owned them, prizing carriages and caps and treasuring them, taking this as "attaining one’s aspiration." When the lodging departs, they are not joyful, not knowing that these are not of their nature and life.

Thus the noble person neither exults in prosperity nor feels shame in poverty—this is why they are free from sorrow. If one takes the transient carriages and caps as joy, and their departure as sorrow, then the joy of their former attainment was surely not untainted. To lose oneself and forfeit one’s nature is called "inversion"—no wonder!

**Detailed Annotation on the Dao:**
To exhaust knowledge in governing the world is a petty practice; to exhaust knowledge in exhausting virtue is a petty understanding. The Dao emerges from destiny, virtue emerges from nature. At birth, no one lacks the principle of preserving nature and destiny, virtue and the Dao. What the heart pursues lies nowhere beyond this—thus "attaining one’s aspiration" means nothing more than rejoicing in wholeness.

Those who lose their nature forget their priceless selves and chase after fleeting honors, taking carriages and caps as the root of life and destiny, and the physical form as the repository of sorrow and joy. They do not know that what they gain is but dust and decay, while what they lose is that by which they are themselves—how is this different from using the Marquis of Sui’s pearl to shoot a sparrow a thousand fathoms high?

**Bixu’s Annotation:**
The virtuous act values silence; the one who guards foolishness preserves blessings. Dwelling in tranquility, transcendent and serene, returning to the root and recovering destiny—what more is there to do? Petty practices distort custom; petty understanding boasts of its cleverness. Some lines bring benefit, others harm—how can this be called "attaining one’s aspiration"? What comes by chance cannot be warded off; what departs cannot be halted. To be swayed by things, gaining and losing—how much one is enslaved! Those without an inner master feel sorrow when it is lost, and thus their attainment is never untainted. This is joy in externals and loss within.

**Fu Zhai’s Saying:**
"Preserving the body" refers to times of non-action; "acting with the body" refers to times of action. To possess knowledge yet not adorn it with words, to have surplus wisdom yet not dare to use it all—thus, though one employs knowledge, one does not lose one’s natural nature. "Standing perilously in one’s place" means the foundation one establishes is lofty. "Returning to one’s nature" is to return to unity without trace. Non-action is the greatness of the Dao; action is a petty practice. Unknowing and unperceiving is the greatness of virtue; having knowledge is petty understanding. By rectifying oneself, things are rectified—thus what one rejoices in is whole, and the attainment of one’s aspiration lies here, not in external things. To add nothing to one’s joy is to turn inward and be sincere—no joy is greater than this.

Nature and destiny are Heaven’s nobility; carriages and caps are external things. Knowing their coming and going cannot be certain, the enlightened are not reckless in prosperity nor broken in poverty. Their joy is in the Dao, the same as others’ joy in carriages and caps. If joy resides in oneself, there is no time for sorrow; if joy depends on things, then when things depart, joy departs too. Joy that comes and goes is not true joy—thus it is never untainted.

The self and nature are the root; things and custom are the branches. To prize the branches and lose the root is called "the people of inversion." Discerning knowledge is the instrument of self-harm—thus those who preserve the body do not seek it. The virtue of the world returns to profound silence, to unknowing alone. "Towering" means standing alone, apart from the crowd. "Dwelling in one’s place" means being still and settled here, sufficient to return to one’s natural nature—what need is there for further seeking? Petty practices and petty understanding describe a narrow vision, thus a burden to virtue and the Dao.

The great person rectifies themselves, and things are rectified—thus perfect joy is whole and the original aspiration is attained. Only when nature and destiny are sufficiently valued within can carriages and caps be lightly regarded without.

What comes by chance, what departs temporarily—meet it without intention. If one sorrows when the transient departs, one must rejoice when it arrives, and that joy is surely tainted. When the self is lost through things and nature is lost through custom, then caps and shoes are worn upside down. To transform the people of the world thus would be difficult indeed!

"Acting with the body" should be "preserving the body"—the above text clarifies this. "Perilous" should be "towering."

The main idea of this chapter is that people, lacking a vision transcending worldly dust and blindly following worldly paths, gradually lose their original nature—all are those who refine their nature and confuse their desires with custom. Though not overtly evil, this obstructs the Dao even more. How much worse when one adds external learning and disturbs it with deluded thoughts, yet still hopes to restore the clarity of the beginning—this is like heading for Ying while turning the carriage north!

The True Person further fears that scholars may dread the vast emptiness, finding no place to apply effort, and thus sets forth the theory of harmonizing tranquility and knowledge, making it easier to enter. People living in the world, responding to situations and adapting to change, cannot forget knowledge. The use of knowledge harms tranquility—the key lies in carefully weighing what is appropriate and handling it with the Dao. When matters arise, knowledge and perception appear; when matters depart, tranquility remains. Over time, with long practice, both are transformed. Spirit, soul, and essence merge into supreme harmony, aligning nature and destiny with the subtle and formless, returning to the root of virtue and the Dao. From this, when one expands and dwells among the people of the world, blending indistinctly and attaining serenity, though possessing knowledge, one has no use for it. Thus the transformation is vast. How can one not lose the pure harmony? Customs tend toward superficiality and shallowness, departing from the Dao and endangering virtue, extinguishing authenticity and drowning the heart—leading to the mutual ruin of the world’s ways, beyond recovery!

Then there are the sages of the mountains and forests, deeply rooted and profoundly tranquil, awaiting the encounter of dawn and dusk. Preserving the body is how one preserves the Dao. The coming and going of the transient admit no joy or sorrow—how then can knowledge and discernment compare to the joy of wholeness and the attainment of aspiration, which transcends the glory of carriages and caps? People rest without knowing to seek this. This is the way of sages and worthies, concealing themselves to preserve their integrity.

The heart of the *Nanhua* is indeed revealed here.

**Chapter One: Autumn Floods**

When autumn floods arrive, the hundred streams pour into the Yellow River. The surging currents swell so vast that between its banks and islets, one cannot distinguish ox from horse. Thereat, the River Lord rejoiced, believing all the world’s beauty to be his alone. Following the current eastward, he reached the Northern Sea. Gazing east, he saw no end to the waters. Then the River Lord turned his face, sighed toward Ruo of the Northern Sea, and said:

There is a rustic saying: “One who hears a hundred teachings and deems none his equal—this describes me.” I once heard of those who belittle Confucius’s learning and make light of Boyi’s righteousness; at first, I did not believe it. Now that I behold the boundlessness of your waters, had I not come to your gate, I would have been in peril—forever ridiculed by those of great understanding.

Ruo of the Northern Sea replied:

A well-frog cannot speak of the sea, for it is confined by its hollow. A summer insect cannot speak of ice, for it is bound by its season. A narrow scholar cannot speak of the Dao, for he is constrained by his teachings. Now that you have emerged from your banks and beheld the great sea, you know your own limitations—only then can you be spoken to of great principles.

Of all the waters under heaven, none is greater than the sea. The ten thousand streams flow into it, yet it never fills, though none knows when they cease. Its tailgate drains it, yet it never empties, though none knows when it ends. Unchanged by spring or autumn, unmoved by flood or drought—its measure surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow River, beyond all reckoning. Yet I have never taken pride in this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth and receive my qi from yin and yang. Between heaven and earth, I am but a pebble or twig upon a great mountain. Even now, I feel my own smallness—how could I take pride in myself?

Consider the four seas within heaven and earth—are they not like a tiny crevice in a vast marsh? Consider the Central States within the seas—are they not like a grain of millet in a granary? The number of things is called ten thousand, yet humans are but one among them. Humans occupy the nine provinces, where grain grows and boats and carriages travel—yet each is but one among them. Compared to the ten thousand things, is this not like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body?

The succession of the Five Emperors, the strife of the Three Kings, the concerns of the benevolent, the toils of the devoted—all are encompassed herein. Boyi rejected it to gain fame; Confucius discoursed on it to display his erudition. Their self-regard was no different from your earlier pride in your waters.

**Guo Xiang’s Annotation:**
“Cannot distinguish ox from horse” describes its vastness. “Forever ridiculed by those of great understanding” means knowing one’s smallness and not presuming grandeur, for one’s principle and portion are inherently fixed, and the desire for eminence has no place therein. What beings naturally find peace in is each pursuing its own limit; knowing one’s portion, one may be spoken to of principle. The capacity of the hundred streams is measured by the river, the river by the sea, the sea by heaven and earth—each has its measure.

This rhetoric seems to suggest that observing the great can clarify the small, but its intent is otherwise! What the world rests in is not level; thus, those of great substance dismiss the small as insignificant, while those of small substance deem the great as utterly sufficient. Hence, they vie in boasting, look about in confusion—this is the delusion of the common folk. To correct this, nothing is better than first exhausting their differences and then following their own claims.

What is called “great” is utterly sufficient, so even an autumn hair adds no burden to heaven and earth. What is called “small” is without excess, so heaven and earth cannot surpass an autumn hair. Only then does each know its limit, and things rest in their portion. Those who wander freely use their natural steps to roam in the realm of self-contentment.

If one observes the great yet cannot be at peace with the small, or gazes upon the small and deems it much, one will rush into the realm of victory and defeat, aiding the world’s boastfulness—how can this grasp the essence of the *Nanhua*? The distinction between small and great cannot be overstepped. Thus, the deeds of the Five Emperors, Three Kings, seven worthies, and devoted scholars do not extend beyond a single domain. Things have their fixed domains; even the most knowing cannot exceed them. Thus, the contrast between small and great serves to illuminate the boundlessness of the supreme principle.

**Lü Huiqing’s Annotation:**
“When autumn floods arrive, the hundred streams pour into the Yellow River” is a metaphor for learning that comes from without yet does not reach the great Dao. “Between its banks and islets, one cannot distinguish ox from horse” means pursuing the Dao without transcending its two sides and center, thus failing to attain all-encompassing vision. “Following the current to the Northern Sea” means seeking along principle and thus finding its ultimate destination. “Turning his face, sighing toward Ruo” means returning to the great Dao, following the path of boundlessness.

“Confined by its hollow” limits small and great. “Bound by its season” restricts near and far. “Constrained by his teachings” is controlled by doctrines and boundaries. This is why the world cannot attain freedom. Emerging from the banks and beholding the great sea, one sheds these confines and attains the vision of boundlessness—only then can one be spoken to of great principle. “The ten thousand streams flow into it, yet it never fills” means that adding to it does not increase it...

The Tail Conduit drains it yet it never empties—thus diminishing it does not increase its loss. It is not constrained by near or far, nor limited by small or great: such is water’s nearness to the Dao.

The Four Seas lie within Heaven and Earth; the Central States lie within the seas; and humankind lies among the ten thousand things. Though faint as if absent or present, so slight is its standing, yet the Five Emperors, the Three Kings, the humane, and the worthy have wearied themselves with cares no greater than this. Some have even renounced it to make a name, or spoken of it to display their learning. Yet from the boundless perspective of the great Dao, their claims are trivial and their knowledge scant—how could this be mere empty talk?

Lin Yi’s solitary note: Those confined by locality cannot turn from their surroundings; those bound by time cannot adapt to change; those shackled by doctrine cannot follow the Dao. The Dao is the year; the sage is the season. Clinging to a single season and doubting the year, one will never hear of the Dao.

The sage’s words respond to the times and change accordingly: what changes is speech, what remains constant is the Dao. The Dao disperses into teachings, and each teaching peddles its master’s doctrine. Over time, these harden into rigid constraints, clogging the flow. Today, Confucians condemn Buddhists, Buddhists condemn Daoists—unaware that the Three Sages established their teachings with the same intent. Failing to grasp this, all remain bound by doctrine.

Now, the River Lord emerges from his banks and beholds the sea, no longer blinded by partiality, and thus can be spoken to of great principle. The Northern Sea receives the ten thousand streams yet never fills; the Tail Conduit drains it yet it never empties. Its flow far surpasses the Yangtze and Yellow River—how could it be measured? Yet it never boasts of this, for when compared to Heaven and Earth, it is shaped by them and governed by yin and yang. My form exists between Heaven and Earth like a twig or pebble upon Mount Tai. A termite’s nest in a tree hollow, a grain of millet or mustard seed placed among mountains and marshes—each is as insignificant as the Northern Sea within Heaven and Earth.

Things are numbered by the myriad as a full count. Humankind is but one among the ten thousand things. The Central States are but a gathering of people within the Nine Provinces—how different from a single hair on a horse’s body? The Five Emperors’ succession of abdications, the Three Kings’ wars of conquest, the humane’s concern for the people, the worthy’s fulfillment of duty—though their deeds differ, all are confined to the tiniest of measures. Boyi renounced his state to make a name; Confucius compiled the classics to display his learning and boast to his age—both were like the River Lord priding himself on his waters.

Chen Xiangdao’s note: Laozi often likened the Dao to water, for the Dao depends on having a root, just as water values having a source. Zhuangzi used the Northern Sea to represent the sage’s Dao and the autumn river to symbolize the proliferation of the Hundred Schools. At that time, the great Dao was fragmented among the Hundred Schools, and natural truth was submerged in vulgar habits. Yet those of limited vision still delighted in believing all the world’s beauty lay within themselves—like the frog in the well who cannot be spoken to of the sea, or the summer insect who cannot be spoken to of ice. Only upon awakening does one look up to the heavens and belittle the world’s dwellings, ascend Mount Tai and recognize the smallness of all other peaks—this is why the “Autumn Floods” was written.

The Hundred Schools’ learning exalts expansion and multitude, hence the allegory of the River Lord. The sage’s Dao values harmony with things, hence the allegory of the Sea Lord. The ten thousand streams flow into it yet it never fills; the Tail Conduit drains it yet it never empties—this is because the Returning Abyss has no bottom. When small and great are compared, the burdens of excess and deficiency arise; when small and great are forgotten, the emotions of pride and awe vanish. Zhuangzi does not seek mutual forgetting but mutual comparison, driving lesser ways to find their home in the great expanse.

Chen Bixu’s note: “Gazing at the ocean” describes the vastness of the waters. Before reaching the sea’s mouth, one remains narrow and crude, mocked by those without corners. Thus, adapting to change and embracing breadth is the great Dao. Noble and petty each have their limits; to speak beyond one’s measure is to invite disgrace. Only those who recognize their disgrace can be spoken to of principle; only those who know their folly are not truly foolish.

No water is greater than the sea, yet it never boasts—this embodies the virtue of humility, putting others first and oneself last. The struggles of Qi and Wei over a snail’s horn, the multitudes dwelling in the tiniest of spaces—these are analogies for the petty. The Five Emperors’ “continuity” refers to the succession of benevolence and righteousness.

Lin’s *Fuzhai Oral Teachings* states: *Jing* means turbid—the Yellow River surges and muddies, swelling its banks, hence “the great *jing* flow of the two banks,” not the *Jing* of the Jing and Wei rivers. *Yang* refers to the sea’s midst. *Ruo* is the name of a sea god. “Bound by locality and time” resembles the cricket unaware of spring and autumn. The Tail Conduit is the Scorched Waste, as seen in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. A *pan* hollow is a tiny burrow. Humankind is but one among the ten thousand things—this is discussed in relation to the vastness of the Great Void. Within the Nine Provinces, it is but a single entity—this is discussed in relation to grasses, trees, birds, and beasts. These two lines are exquisitely phrased, showing how small the world is: the knowledge and abilities of the Five Emperors and Three Kings do not exceed its bounds.

Chu’s *Superficial Views* states: “One who has seen the sea finds other waters unsatisfying; one who has studied at the sage’s gate finds other words inadequate.” Thus, when the autumn floods arrive, the River Lord rejoices; when he reaches the sea, he gazes in awe and shame—no wonder the Sea Lord invokes the parables of the well frog and summer insect. Then, describing the Northern Sea’s immeasurable vastness, he notes that the Four Seas within Heaven and Earth, the Central States within the Four Seas, are no more than a hair on a horse’s body—how can one know there is nothing beyond Heaven and Earth greater still? Thus, this chapter uses the dialogue between river and sea to clarify the distinctions of small and great, few and many, akin to the debates of the roc and cicada. The transformations of its literary structure grow ever more marvelous.

The Sea Lord first responds with the intent to loosen the constrained views of the narrow scholar, dispelling his delusions of self-importance and guiding him toward the grander Way. The full depth of this discourse unfolds below.

The River Lord asks: “Then may I consider Heaven and Earth as great and the tip of a hair as small?”

The Northern Sea Lord replies: “No. For things have measure without end, time without cessation, division without constancy, and beginning and end without fixity. Thus, the one of great wisdom observes both far and near: small yet not meager, great yet not excessive, knowing measure to be boundless. He verifies past and present, ancient and modern, and so remains untroubled by distance, unconfounded by brevity, knowing time to be unceasing. He examines fullness and emptiness, and thus gains without delight, loses without sorrow, knowing division to be inconstant. He perceives the level path, and thus lives without elation, dies without calamity, knowing beginning and end to be without fixity.

“Consider: what man knows is less than what he does not know; the time of his life is less than the time before his birth. Seeking to exhaust the boundless realm of the greatest with what is most minute—this is why he becomes confused and cannot attain self-possession. From this perspective, how can one know the tip of a hair suffices to define the finest limit? And how can one know Heaven and Earth suffice to exhaust the realm of the greatest?”

Guo’s commentary: “Each thing has its measure; life and death follow their seasons; gain and loss are allotted by fate; beginning and end renew daily. Each is sufficient in itself, without excess—thus, whether distant or near, small or great, each thing has its measure. *Shun* means ‘illuminating.’ *Jingu* means ‘past and present.’ *Yao* means ‘long.’ *Rang* means ‘short.’ Verifying past and present, one knows transformation does not cease with life and death—thus, one does not grow weary of the long nor stumble over the short. Observing the alternation of fullness and emptiness, one knows fate is not constant in gain. To forget sorrow and joy, life and death—this is the true Way of daily renewal. Illuminating the daily renewal of beginning and end, one knows the past cannot be clung to or retained. Thus, one treads the new without alarm, relinquishes the old without surprise. Though the transformations of life and death are as one, what one knows remains limited; each lifetime has its allotment. Better to rest content in one’s received portion—then great and small are both sufficient. If the tip of a hair does not seek the achievement of Heaven and Earth, then all else in the body becomes superfluous. If Heaven and Earth are not seen as greater than the tip of a hair, then their forms and appearances are merely self-sufficient—how can one know what defines the finest as fine or the greatest as great?”

Lü’s commentary: “The Dao is neither small nor great—how can it have a fixed form? Now, Heaven and Earth: we deem them the greatest, yet when we exhaust all we know, we cannot reach their limit. Then what we call great—is it truly great? What we call small—is it truly small? Small is not meager; great is not excessive—this is to know measure as boundless. I take *shun* as ‘past’ and *jin* as ‘present,’ yet before the word is spoken, the present has already become the past. Then what we call past and present—do they ever cease? Verifying that past and present are both ‘old,’ one remains untroubled by distance, unconfounded by brevity, knowing time to be unceasing. How can I languish in service to a century’s lord—this is to be troubled by distance. Pengzu was famed for his longevity, yet when the common people compare themselves to him, they stumble over brevity. The sun turns at noon; the moon wanes after fullness. Observing fullness and emptiness, one gains without delight, loses without sorrow, knowing division to be inconstant. There is always a beginning to an end, an end to a beginning. Tracing origin to outcome, one perceives the level path—thus, one lives without elation, dies without calamity, knowing beginning and end to be without fixity. Then what we call time, division, beginning, and end—are they truly known? If knowledge is not true knowledge, then what is known is surely less than what is unknown! After birth, one has knowledge; before birth, one has none—thus, the time of one’s life is surely less than the time before one’s birth. Knowing the most minute, yet seeking to exhaust the boundless realm of the greatest with it—how can this not lead to confusion and self-loss?”

Yu Du’s commentary: “Viewed by form, things have small and great; viewed by the Dao, things have no small or great. *Measure* is the balance of things. *Time* is the transformation of things. *Division* is the differentiation and regulation of things. *Beginning and end* are the life and death of things. From the perspective of great wisdom, none of these suffice to determine the far or near, small or great of things. Illuminating and verifying the Way traversed in past and present, though it be distant, the mind suffers no obstruction. What one takes is easily gathered, without forced stumbling—this is what one who knows time to be unceasing can do. Observing fullness and emptiness, gain and loss arise without attachment, knowing division to be inconstant. The world’s sorrows all stem from gain and loss; only the one of great wisdom knows gain and loss are not one’s own, allowing them to follow their natural course without joy or sorrow. Perceiving the level path, life and death do not move the heart—thus, one renews daily without clinging to the past. When man has knowledge, he is enslaved by it, toiling in body and resting in mind, chasing things and forgetting the self—this is not as good as the self-possession of non-knowledge. After birth, one is enslaved by life, restless and agitated—this is not as good as the time before birth, utterly still and empty. Man’s knowledge is most minute; the realm of the myriad things is most vast. To seek the vast with the minute—what is this if not confusion? To know the measure of things is boundless, then small and great are not matters of meagerness or excess. To know time is unceasing, then past and present are not grounds for weariness or stumbling. To know division is inconstant, then gain and loss are not grounds for sorrow or joy. To know beginning and end are without fixity, then life and death are not grounds for calamity or elation. What man uses to observe these is his knowledge.”

Thus, the possession of knowledge arises from the fact of having life. If one can obscure the very grounds of knowing and return to the state before birth, then who is to say the great is not the most minute, or the minute is not the most great?

*Bi Xu’s Commentary:* When the measure of things is boundless, one cannot speak of small or great. When time is unceasing, one cannot speak of succession or decay. When division is inconstant, one cannot speak of gain or loss. When beginning and end are without fixity, one cannot speak of transformation or change.

The great person purifies and gazes into the profound mirror, knowing distant things as small. Their use is manifold, yet near to the great principle, and what they expend is most minimal—thus their capacity knows no limit. To dance is to move as of old. Remote and unilluminable, like the present rushing past and unprovable; things shift and cannot be grasped, each day renews and cannot be clung to—thus time is hard to retain. What value is there in examining the fullness of wealth? Therefore, one does not rejoice in gaining it. Knowing the baseness of poverty and emptiness, one does not grieve in losing it. Knowing life and death as departure and return, one does not distinguish delight from aversion. Welcoming, one does not see the beginning; following, one does not see the end—how could principle have fixity?

Thus, discriminating knowledge has limits, while the vast and empty void is boundless. In life, profit and harm intermingle; in death, all is silent and vacant. To pursue the Kunlun wastes with the aims of an ant or midge is to be confounded. The tip of a hair is complete in itself, its minute detail more than sufficient; the vast expanse of heaven and earth is flawed and incomplete, its great domain insufficient.

*Yongzhai’s Note:* Earlier, it spoke of the great; here, it speaks of the absence of small and great—this is what is meant by "nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small." The measure of things is boundless, meaning it cannot be quantified. Time is unceasing, meaning cold and heat, day and night. Division is inconstant, meaning being and non-being, gain and loss. Beginning and end refer to the new and the old.

Only the person of great knowledge can then possess the four knowings below: perceiving past and present as one, thus what approaches but has not yet arrived is distant yet not a cause for sorrow; what recedes and may be grasped is easy yet not a cause for struggle. Following the correct Dao, one leaves life and death to themselves. Understanding this, one knows the end is like the beginning—it cannot be taken as fixed.

What man knows is man; what he does not know is Heaven. After birth, I know it; before birth, how could I know? To seek the vastness of Heaven with man’s most minute knowledge—is this not confusion and self-loss? If one can know the inconstancy of the measure of things, time, and division, then what are beginning and end, small and great, more and less?

Examining the unceasing flux of past and present, this principle becomes visible. "Remote" refers to the passage of long time; "receding" refers to swift transformation. Not questioning is to be without weariness toward what is born. Not stumbling is to be without seeking to augment life.

The span of life is fixed by one’s allotted portion—one must simply accept it. Though man cannot be without birth or without knowledge, the sutra speaks of "not being as good as having no knowledge" and "not being as good as not yet being born." This is because worldly people do not pursue true knowledge but seek delusive knowledge, do not preserve life in its wholeness but seek to augment it. With what is limited, they chase what is boundless; forgetting their inherent portion, they covet what lies beyond. If they cannot even discern the advantages and harms that concern themselves, how can they determine the boundaries of the fine and vast in the principles of things?

"Not being as good as having no knowledge" refers to Wang Ni’s answer to Nie Que. "Not being as good as not yet being born" refers to the skull’s unwillingness to be troubled by inquiry. Yet since one is already born and already possesses knowledge, how can one avoid this? The answer lies in being able to take non-birth as birth and non-knowledge as knowledge—then what burden is there in life, and what possession in knowledge?

*The Meaning of the Ocean of the True Scripture of the Southern Florescence, Fascicle Fifty-Two*
By Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin

**Autumn Floods, Part Two**

The River Earl said: "All the debaters of the world say: 'The most refined has no form; the greatest cannot be encompassed.' Is this truly so?"

The Lord of the Northern Sea replied: "One who views the great from the perspective of the small cannot exhaust it; one who views the small from the perspective of the great cannot discern it. The refined is the subtlest of the small; the vast is the fullness of the great—thus their advantages differ. This is the nature of their conditions.

The refined and the coarse are limited to what has form. What has no form cannot be divided by calculation; what cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by calculation. What can be discussed in words is the coarse aspect of things; what can be grasped by intention is the refined aspect of things. That which words cannot discuss and intention cannot reach does not pertain to the refined or the coarse.

Therefore, the conduct of the great person does not involve harming others, nor does it emphasize benevolence and kindness. Their actions are not for profit, nor do they despise gatekeepers and servants. They do not contend over wealth and goods, nor do they excessively yield or defer. In affairs, they do not rely on others; they do not overvalue laboring for sustenance, nor do they despise greed and corruption. Their conduct differs from the common, yet they do not excessively avoid eccentricity. In action, they follow the multitude, yet they do not despise flattery and obsequiousness. The world’s ranks and emoluments are insufficient to encourage them; punishments and shame are insufficient to humiliate them. They know that right and wrong cannot be divided, and that the fine and the vast cannot be demarcated.

It is said: 'The person of the Dao is not renowned; the highest virtue is not attained; the great person has no self.' This is the utmost of restrained distinction."

**Guo’s Commentary:**
The eye’s vision has its limits; thus, in regard to the great, there is that which it cannot exhaust, and in regard to the small, there is that which it cannot discern. This is simply what the eye cannot reach. The refined and the great are not nonexistent—how could one know that which has no form and cannot be encompassed? Since great and small differ, their advantages cannot be the same. If something has no form and cannot be encompassed, then there is no difference in their advantageous conditions. That which words and intention cannot reach—how can there be refined or coarse? Words and intention exist, but that by which they exist does not. Seek beyond words and intention, enter the realm of no words and no intention, and only then will you attain it!

The great person has no intention but follows the movement of Heaven. With every step, they tread upon auspicious ground—how could they take the path of harming others? Without harming others, they do not overvalue their own kindness. Moving in accordance with principle and acting according to the capacity of things, they occupy their proper place. It is not that they despise and thus assign tasks; each fulfills their determined portion, naturally content and self-sufficient. Principle itself is without desire, thus there is nothing that must be or must not be. This is why they differ from the common yet follow principle, naturally upright. Glory and disgrace do not touch their hearts, thus they are profoundly the same. Entrusting things to their own nature, the nature of things flows freely, and merit and fame return to things—thus they are not renowned. When things each suffer no loss, then attainment and fame depart. It is simply a matter of entrusting things to themselves. Restraining to the utmost of their portion, they become obscure.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
One who views the great from the perspective of the small cannot exhaust it—this is merely what the eye’s power cannot reach, not that it cannot be encompassed. One who views the small from the perspective of the great—like a butterfly or gnat perched on a mosquito’s eyelash, seen yet unseen—this is merely what the eye cannot discern, not that it has no form.

The refined and the coarse pertain to what has form. What has no form cannot be divided by calculation; what cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by calculation. What can be discussed in words is the coarse aspect of things; what can be grasped by intention is the refined aspect of things. The Dao transcends words and intention and does not pertain to the refined or the coarse.

Thus, the conduct of the great person does not involve harming others—this is the nature of their inherent disposition. They do not emphasize benevolence and kindness—this is not deliberate action. Gatekeepers and servants act for profit. Yielding and deference mean not contending. Laboring for sustenance means not relying on others. Greed and corruption are the opposite. Avoiding eccentricity means acting for the sake of differing from the common. Flattery and obsequiousness mean following rulers and parents rather than the multitude. All of this arises naturally. The world’s ranks, emoluments, punishments, and penalties are insufficient to encourage or restrain them. How could they know the division of right and wrong or the demarcation of the fine and the vast? If one can restrain to the utmost of their portion, reaching the point of no division, this is why the person of the Dao is not renowned, why the highest virtue is not attained, and why the great person has no self.

**Yu Du’s Commentary:**
The scripture says: "Is the deep blue of the sky its true color, or is it so distant that it has no end?" Thus, one who views the great from the perspective of the small cannot exhaust it; one who views the small from the perspective of the great cannot discern it. The debaters of the world, relying on what their eyes can see, believe they have attained understanding—how foolish they are!

Moreover, Heaven and Earth are but small things within the void. From my perspective, they are boundlessly great—not because Heaven and Earth are great, but because my body is small! The tip of an autumn hair is fine within form, yet from afar, it cannot be seen—not because the autumn hair has no substance, but because I am distant from it. Abandoning the eye’s power and uniting with it in spirit, then even the greatest can be encompassed, and the smallest has form. This is why the Lord of the Sea excels in discussing the Dao and deducing it by principle.

The subtlest is called "minute"; the refined is even smaller. The *ping* is chaff. Viewed from the great, it is still a fine thing; viewed from the refined, it is already the fullness of the great. The refined and coarse of things can be grasped by intention; what can be discussed in words merely exhausts things—how could it suffice to encompass the Dao? Only the wordless word, what the ear cannot hear and intention cannot fathom, what those with minds cannot attain—how could it be exhausted by the refined or the coarse?

The great person is self-sufficient within their portion. Though they do not harm others, their benevolence and kindness extend to others, yet they do not emphasize it, following what is naturally present without adding to it. Though their actions are not for profit, they do not despise gatekeepers and servants. Gatekeepers and servants are those who hold the gate for sustenance. Though they do not contend over wealth and goods, they also do not excessively yield or defer to others. In affairs, they do not rely on others, and though they labor for sustenance, they do not overvalue it. Though their conduct differs from the common, they avoid eccentricity and act in accordance with the multitude.

All this constitutes the conduct of the great person.
Lofty, they do not emulate the purity and harmony of Yi or Hui;
Humble, they do not descend to the cruelty and violence of bandits and thieves.
How could they know of rank and emolument as incentives,
Or execution and disgrace as shame?
What concern have they for the distinctions of right and wrong,
Or the boundaries of the fine and the vast?

Thus, the Dao is without what can be heard,
Virtue is without what can be attained—
This arises from the great person’s selflessness,
Exhausting their nature within its allotted portion to reach utmost simplicity.

*Detailed Annotation on the Dao* states:
The great person in relation to the world forgets things through the mind,
Forgets the mind through the Dao.
They do not act to harm others—
One might suspect their benevolence and kindness to be excessive, yet they do not overemphasize benevolence and kindness.
Though they do not contend over wealth and goods,
One might suspect they should yield and defer to others, yet they do not excessively yield or defer.
In affairs, they do not rely on others,
One might suspect they overvalue laboring for sustenance, yet they do not overvalue it.
Though their conduct differs from the common,
One might suspect they indulge in eccentricity, yet they do not indulge in eccentricity.
They do not despise gatekeepers and servants to exalt themselves,
Nor do they despise the corrupt and filthy to purify themselves,
Nor do they despise flatterers and sycophants to assert their own integrity.

Thus, rank and emolument, execution and disgrace cannot disturb their inner being;
Right and wrong, the fine and the vast are not worth distinguishing externally.
Then how could the refined and the coarse—
Those confined to words, theories, intentions, and expressions—
Ever occupy their minds?

What is heard is not hearing of *that*;
What is attained is no attainment.
Reaching selflessness,
One loses the self—
How then could there be any *thing*?
Without simplifying to the utmost within one’s portion,
One cannot reach this ultimate state.

*Bixu’s Annotation* states:
The butterfly and the mantis do not venture to the sea’s edge;
The roc does not regard the mugwort and wormwood.
All vision has its limits—
Exceeding measure leads to peril.
Refinement does not transcend form,
Yet it remains bound by words, theories, intentions, and expressions.
Knowing that favor and profit summon harm,
They do not contend over wealth and goods.
Though their conduct differs from the common,
They remain harmonious without advocating divergence.
Rank and emolument are insufficient as incentives;
Execution and disgrace are not taken as shame—
They place their person outside such concerns.
Right and wrong cannot be distinguished;
The fine and the vast cannot be demarcated—
They empty their minds.
The Dao-person does not hear,
For to hear would be to make it speakable.
Ultimate virtue is not attained,
For attainment would be followed by loss.
The great person is without self—
The self, too, is but a thing.
All the above reaches the utmost simplicity within one’s portion,
Yet it is not a matter of natural spontaneity.

*Yongzhai* says:
Those who peer at the heavens through a tube cannot see all;
The roc and the sparrow gazing down at the dust cannot perceive clearly.
The infinitesimally small cannot be measured in parts—
To call it a hair or a mote would be inadequate.
The immeasurably vast cannot be encompassed in numbers—
To call it a grain or a trillion would be insufficient.
The refined and the coarse are confined by form,
Thus they can be inferred through words, theories, intentions, and expressions.
But if the small and the vast are both formless,
They transcend the reach of words and intentions,
And cannot be discussed in terms of refinement or coarseness.

Though they do not harm things, they also do not cherish them—
Thus it is said they do not act to harm others, nor do they overemphasize benevolence and kindness.
Gatekeepers and servants are base laborers who seek profit—
I do not seek profit, nor do I deem those who do as wrong.
I do not contend over wealth, nor do I consider yielding a virtue.
In all affairs, I act independently, relying on no one,
Yet I do not exhaust my strength to sustain myself.
I do not despise the corrupt and filthy,
And though my conduct differs from others, I do not set myself apart—
This is to follow the multitude, blending light and merging with the dust.
I do not despise flatterers and sycophants,
But remain at ease in their company,
Able to dissolve my own intentions.
Such people make no distinctions of right and wrong,
Merging the fine and the vast.
Not hearing, there is no fame.
Not attaining, there is no loss.
The great person unites ultimate principle with utmost simplicity,
Fulfilling the affairs of their allotted portion.
Simplifying to one’s portion is to fulfill oneself.
Viewing the vast from the perspective of the fine,
One stops at what cannot be exhausted—
Yet the vast does not stop there.
Viewing the fine from the perspective of the vast,
One stops at what cannot be perceived—
Yet the fine is not formless.
Refinement is the extreme of the fine;
Vastness is the fullness of the great.
Though the small and the vast differ,
Both have form and number, thus they are subject to formation and decay.
When refinement reaches formlessness,
And vastness becomes immeasurable,
They are no longer defined by form or divided by number—
Thus they are beyond formation and decay.

What is coarse can be discussed in words;
What is refined can be inferred through intention.
Beyond refinement and coarseness,
Words and intentions cannot reach—
Is this not the Dao alone?
Thus, the great person prioritizes benefiting things,
Yet does not overemphasize benevolence and kindness.
Though not moved by profit, they do not despise those who pursue it.
The following all describe how the great person’s conduct differs from the common,
Even to the point of not despising flatterers and sycophants—
Thus, the noble and the base proceed on their own paths,
Right and wrong, the fine and the vast are not worth distinguishing,
And how could rank and disgrace serve as incentives or deterrents?
From this, we know the great person empties the self to let virtue and the Dao return—
They do not transgress their portion to seek beyond it.
Virtue and the Dao are the most noble,
Yet seeking them within one’s portion is sufficient—
Thus, they are also the easiest.
Now, people of the world abandon the internal to seek the external,
Forsake the easy to pursue the difficult—
Is this not delusion?

The River Earl said:
"Beyond things, within things—
Where do the distinctions of noble and base arise?
Where do the boundaries of small and vast appear?"
The Lord of the Northern Sea replied:
"From the perspective of the Dao, things have no noble or base;
From the perspective of things, each esteems itself and despises others;
From the perspective of custom, noble and base do not reside in oneself.
From the perspective of differentiation,
Following what is great in each and deeming it great,
Then nothing is not great;
Following what is small in each and deeming it small,
Then nothing is not small.
Knowing that heaven and earth are but a grain of rice,
And a tip of hair is but a mountain,
Then the distinctions of measure become apparent.
From the perspective of function,
Following what each possesses and deeming it possessed,
Then nothing is not possessed;
Following what each lacks and deeming it lacking,
Then nothing is not lacking.
Knowing that east and west are opposites yet cannot be without each other,
Then the divisions of function are settled."

From the perspective of inclination,
Following what each deems right and deeming it right,
Then nothing is not right;
Following what each deems wrong and deeming it wrong,
Then nothing is not wrong.
Knowing that Yao and Jie each deemed themselves right and the other wrong,
Then the inclinations of conduct become apparent.

Of old, Yao and Shun yielded the throne and became emperors,
Zhi and Qiang yielded and perished;
Tang and Wu contended and became kings,
Duke Bai contended and was destroyed.
From this we observe:
The rites of contention and yielding,
The conduct of Yao and Jie,
Nobility and baseness have their times,
And cannot be taken as constant.

A battering-ram can breach a city wall,
Yet cannot plug a rat-hole—
This speaks of differing implements.
The famed steeds Qi Ji and Lü Li
Can gallop a thousand li in a day,
Yet catch mice not as well as a wildcat—
This speaks of differing skills.
The owl snatches fleas at night,
Discerns the tip of a hair,
Yet by day, though its eyes stare wide, cannot see a mountain—
This speaks of differing natures.

Thus it is said:
Shall we take right as our teacher and have no wrong?
Shall we take order as our teacher and have no chaos?
This is not yet to understand the principles of heaven and earth,
Nor the conditions of the myriad things.
It is like taking heaven as teacher while ignoring earth,
Taking yin as teacher while ignoring yang—
Its impossibility is manifest.
Yet still they speak without ceasing—
If not fools, then deceivers!

The abdications of emperors and kings differ,
The successions of the Three Dynasties differ.
Those who miss their time and defy custom
Are called usurpers;
Those who meet their time and follow custom
Are called righteous men.

Silent, O River Lord—
How could you know the gate of nobility and baseness,
The house of small and great?

**Guo’s Commentary:**
Things have no nobility or baseness—each is sufficient in itself.
That they esteem themselves and despise one another
Is but the petty workings of the Dao,
Which interweaves and equalizes them.
Nobility and baseness do not reside in oneself—
This is what is called inversion.
What is great is sufficient;
What is small leaves no surplus.

By virtue of its nature being sufficient to be called great,
Even a hairtip or cinnabar speck cannot differ in name from hills and mountains;
By virtue of its leaving no surplus to be called small,
Even heaven and earth or a grain of millet cannot differ in designation.

Yet should one observe distinctions without following this Way,
Then mutual imposition and mutual overthrow would be beyond all reckoning.
The world knows nothing but mutual "that" and "this"—
Such is the opposition of east and west.

Yet even lips and teeth never act for each other,
And when the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold—
What "that" does becomes the vast accomplishment of "this"!
Thus, if one relies on self-serving action and denies its achievement,
Then all achievements under heaven would be null;
If one recognizes their mutual indispensability and acknowledges their achievement,
Then all achievements under heaven would be present.

But should one forget the achievement of self-serving action
And dwell instead upon the kindness of mutual aid,
The more such kindness is stirred, the more hypocrisy and shallowness proliferate—
The world would suffer twofold loss,
And true nature would dissolve into chaos.
Thus, the apportionment of achievement can never be fixed.

All things are so of themselves—
Therefore, none are not so.

All things mutually negate one another, thus none are not negated.
To be without affirmation and without negation—this is Yao.
To be with affirmation and with negation—this is Jie.
Yet these two rulers each received their natural endowment from Heaven,
Unable to act for one another.
Viewing the world’s inclinations and dispositions through Yao and Jie,
One sees they cannot act for one another.

He who responds to Heaven and accords with man to receive all under Heaven—
His advancement is the advancement of yielding and deference.
Yet should one pursue the fleeing,
One loses the very ground of that advance.
If one embraces their differences and entrusts them to their own nature,
Then nothing fails to find its rightful place.

The principle of Heaven and Earth,
The essence of the myriad things,
Take accord with nature as order,
And loss of nature as chaos.
Divergent natures have different conveniences;
Affirmation and negation have no fixed ground.
If one entrusts them to the evenness of Heaven,
Allowing both to proceed freely,
Then though regions differ and kinds vary,
All alike attain their due.

Lu’s commentary: Viewed through the Dao, how can there be noble and base?
Viewed through things, each esteems itself and devalues others—
Yet the Dao is not a thing.
Viewed through custom, noble and base lie not in oneself—
Yet the Dao is not custom.
The Dao is neither thing nor custom,
Thus it is neither noble nor base.

Following what is great and making it great,
Following what is small and making it small,
Knowing that Heaven and Earth differ from the Great Void as a ladder differs from a grain of millet,
And that the tip of a hair differs from the formless as a hill differs from a mountain—
Then what is called difference becomes manifest in number.
Yet the Dao is not difference,
Thus it is neither small nor great.

Following what is present and making it present—
As there is east, so there is west.
Following what is absent and making it absent—
Without east, there is no west.
Knowing that east and west are opposed yet cannot do without one another,
Then what is called achievement finds its fixed apportionment.
Yet the Dao is not achievement,
Thus it is neither presence nor absence.

Following what is so and making it so,
Following what is not so and making it not so,
Knowing that Yao and Jie each arose from self-affirmation and mutually negated one another,
Then what is called inclination becomes manifest in disposition.
Yet the Dao is not inclination,
Thus it is neither affirmation nor negation.

If this is so,
Then one who embodies the Dao forgets both and rests in the evenness of Heaven—
What need has he to distinguish noble and base, small and great?

If one takes Yao and Shun’s yielding as right,
Then Zhi the Tyrant perishes.
If one takes Tang and Wu’s contention as right,
Then the Duke of Bai meets destruction.
The rites of contention and yielding,
The conduct of Yao and Jie,
Noble and base have their times—
They cannot be taken as constant.

A roof beam cannot plug a rat hole,
A qilin cannot catch mice,
An owl cannot see by day—
These three differ, yet to equalize them
Is to fail to understand the principles of Heaven and the essence of things.

Usurpation speaks of the solitary;
Righteous succession speaks of the many.
*Commentary on "the solitary":* As with things’ inner and outer—
This speaks of the inner and outer of natural endowment.

Without noble and without base—this is the principle of nature.
With noble and with base—this is a forced distinction.
Viewed through the Dao, there is no self and other, no right and wrong—
Who then is noble, who base?
Viewed through things, each esteems itself and devalues others.

The noble and base of things do not arise from nature,
But form through habit.
Thus viewed through custom, noble and base lie not in oneself.

The principle of small and great cannot be altered,
Yet their forms differ in degree.
If the small does not seek to become great,
Then the small suffices to be called great.
If the great does not seek to become small,
Then the great suffices to be called small.
Following what is great and finding it sufficient,
Then the tip of a hair may equal a mountain.
Following what is small and finding it without excess,
Then a mountain may equal the tip of a hair.
The degrees of difference among the myriad things are boundless—
What is observed is only thus.

Presence is wondrous presence, constant presence.
Absence is true absence, constant absence.
All moving and growing things under Heaven,
In their birth, nurturing, and growth,
All have their achievements within—
This may be called presence.
Yet the direction of achievement
Belongs to creation, to spontaneity alone—
This may be called absence.
Engaging presence, one does not see absence.
Obscuring absence, one does not see presence.
They are opposed like east and west,
Yet in truth cannot do without one another—
Thus the apportionment of achievement is naturally fixed.

The principles of the myriad things have right and wrong.
Self and other mutually negate—
This is how Yao and Jie were distinguished.
Following their spontaneity in mutual negation,
Then inclinations and dispositions become manifest.
Thus some yield and become emperors,
Some yield and perish.
Some contend and become kings,
Some contend and are destroyed.
The rites of contention and yielding
Were noble in the times of Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu,
Yet base in the times of Zhi and the Duke of Bai.
If Yao is right and Jie wrong,
Each has its time—
They cannot be taken as constant.

Again, consider the differing uses of a roof beam, a qilin, and an owl—
Their skills, their natures, all differ.
To follow right, to follow governance, to follow Heaven, to follow yin—
Each is but one partiality.
Their impracticability is clear.

Abdication and succession,
If not in accord with the times and customs,
Are called usurpation.
If in accord with the times and customs,
They are called righteousness.
Rooted in one yet branching differently—
What grounds are there to judge their superiority?

*Detailed commentary on the Dao:* Viewed through the Dao, things have no noble or base.
Departing from the Dao to follow the customs of things,
Thus in difference there are small and great,
In achievement there are presence and absence,
In inclination there are right and wrong.
Yet if I follow what is great and make it great,
Follow what is small and make it small,
Extending this to the presence and absence of achievement,
To the right and wrong of inclination—
If I observe all through this single lens,
Who then knows the distinctions of great and small, presence and absence, right and wrong?

Yet the principles of all under Heaven differ yet are the same,
Are the same yet differ—
Their transformations are not uniform and cannot be taken as constant.
Viewed through difference, achievement, and inclination,
They differ yet are the same.
Some yield and become emperors,
Some yield and perish.
Some contend and become kings,
Some contend and are destroyed—
This is the same yet different.
Different yet the same lies not in things but in the Dao.
Same yet different lies not in traces but in time.

Not only this—
Uses have their distinct implements,
Abilities their distinct skills,
Lives their distinct natures.
Esteeming this devalues that,
Making that great diminishes this—
How can noble and base, great and small be distinguished?

Thus we know that right and wrong, order and chaos, Heaven and Earth, yin and yang are ever mutually employed—yet cannot be judged by noble or base, great or small.

*Blue Void’s Annotation:* The Dao holds no noble or base; these are but the likes and dislikes of things.

What the world esteems are all external things. To call the microcosm "small" and the tip of a hair "tiny" is not principle. If one deems something great because it is great, then all things may be called great; if one deems something small because it is small, then all things may be called small. This is the calculus of difference, which has long usurped principle.

East and west oppose each other, just as high and low cannot do without one another. If my achievement aids another, then it is so. Were I without achievement, what would they rely upon? What Yao deemed right, all under Heaven deemed right; what Jie affirmed, who dared affirm otherwise? Can the inclinations and conduct of the sage and the commoner be the same?

Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu followed the seasons of Heaven and upheld their allotted roles. Jie and Zhou, the White Duke, defied human affairs and clung to the calculus of difference. Thus noble and base are not fixed—they lie in the divergence of inclinations and conduct. The gentleman and the petty man are distinguished by their capacity and insight!

Yet right and wrong, order and chaos, ever intertwine and lie in wait for one another—this cannot be left unexamined. Those who model themselves on Heaven without Earth, or on yin without yang, are rigid and benighted, unfit to speak of the Dao. Those who defy the times and go against custom, though noble, become base. Those who conform to the times and follow custom, though small, become great.

*Skin Studio’s Note:* When one exalts oneself and disparages others, even chickens and pigs may become emperors for a time. Noble and base do not reside in oneself—this is the meaning of "caps and carriages come and go."

To compare Heaven and Earth to a grain of millet, or a tip of hair to Mount Tai, is to render the calculus of gradation meaningless. Each fulfills its role as its allotted achievement. Farmer, merchant, artisan, and trader—none can be lacking in the world, just as east and west oppose yet cannot do without one another.

To affirm Yao and deny Jie is the natural consequence of inclination and conduct. Yet if none were ever abolished, how could a ruler arise to observe them? Thus the fixity of inclination and conduct cannot be determined. The meaning of "following this" in *The Equality of Things* lies in accepting small and great, presence and absence, right and wrong.

Thus the analogy of distinct implements, distinct skills, and distinct natures to Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, illustrates their mutual indispensability. Usurpers and righteous followers are but the arguments of Yao and Jie. Things hold no noble or base—one forgets even one’s own things. To exalt oneself and disparage others is to fail in discerning that and this. Noble and base do not reside in oneself—one forgets oneself and follows things. To call something great because it is great, or small because it is small, is to accord with what is fitting for things.

As for the presence or absence of achievement and inclination, right and wrong—these oppose yet cannot do without one another. Herein lie the principles of things and the sentiments of humanity!

Thus the accounts of contention and yielding, the deeds of good and evil, noble and base—these shift with the times and cannot be taken as constant. Just as distinct implements have distinct uses, distinct skills distinct abilities, and distinct natures distinct conveniences, they cannot be judged by a single standard.

To model oneself on order without chaos, or on yin without yang, is not to comprehend the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Succession and rebellion, compliance and defiance—each follows its time. You need not say more; even if you speak, you merely discuss their traces. How could you know the origin of noble and base, great and small? To know the origin of noble and base, great and small, one must seek it where things have not yet begun.

*Annotations to the Southern Florescence True Scripture: Ocean of Meanings*, Scroll Fifty-Two, concludes.

*#1 The three characters "故异便" (thus distinct conveniences), according to Ma Shulun’s* Zhuangzi Yizheng*, should be placed below the phrase "自大视细者不明" (those who view the small from a position of greatness are benighted) in the preceding text.*

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin on *"Autumn Floods,"* Chapter Three

The River Earl asked: "Then what should I do? What should I not do? In matters of giving and receiving, pursuing and abandoning—how am I to act in the end?"

The Lord of the Northern Sea replied: "Viewed through the Dao, what is noble and what is base? This is called *reversal and extension*—restrain the will, and you will be greatly at odds with the Dao. What is few and what is many? This is called *gratitude and bestowal*—cling to one course, and you will be out of step with the Dao.

Solemn as a state with its ruler, yet without private virtue; boundless as the sacrifices to the earth-altar, yet without private blessing; vast as the four directions without end, yet without fixed boundaries. Embracing the myriad things, who bears them up? This is called *without direction.*

The myriad things are of one measure—what is short, what is long? The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and life. Do not rely on their completion. Now empty, now full, they do not abide in their forms.

Years cannot be lifted away; time cannot be halted. Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness—when one ends, another begins. This is how we speak of the great meaning’s direction, how we discuss the principle of the myriad things.

When things come to life, they gallop like a swift steed. No movement without change, no moment without shift. What is to be done? What is not to be done? They will transform of themselves."

Guo’s commentary: "The Dao of noble and base turns and returns in cycles. If one clings to restraint, one will not be level with the Dao. Follow one’s allotted portion, and thus what is bestowed will have no constancy. If one cannot follow change, one will not be in accord with the Dao.

Without private virtue, one is impartial and fitting. Without private blessing, all under heaven seek it in common. Thus, drifting boundlessly without fixed place, one governs the multitude of beings, returning to their inherent portion and moving evenly—how could one prop them up with outstretched branches?

Only by being without direction can one take the myriad things as one’s direction, and none will not be sufficient.

Death and life are but one transformation in the endless—neither beginning nor end. Knowing that completion is impermanent, one does not take form as a fixed position and cling to it without change. One may wish to lift it away, but cannot; one may wish to halt it, but may not.

Change is called renewal; it never abides in the old. One should simply follow its use—it cannot be grasped. If one acts or does not act in its midst, one disrupts its self-transformation!"

Lü’s commentary: "Scholars in their mediocrity are bound to things. Once they hear that the Dao has no noble or base, no great or small, they are at a loss in matters of doing or not doing, giving or abandoning, pursuing or forsaking—this is only natural.

What is called noble and base is but the reversal and extension of things, not the Dao. Reversal implies going back; returning is noble, departing is base. Extension implies depletion; extending is noble, depleting is base. Thus, one should let the will roam freely without restraint. If one restrains the will, one will be greatly at variance with the Dao and fail to penetrate it.

What is called few and many is but the gratitude and bestowal of things, not the Dao. Gratitude implies flourishing; gratitude is few, flourishing is many. Bestowal implies gathering; bestowing is many, gathering is few. One should act in both ways without clinging to one. If one clings to one course, one will be out of step with the Dao and fail to match it.

Without private virtue means having no exclusive reliance on those one rules—this is what is meant by *restraining the will without restraint.* Without private blessing means having no exclusive bestowal on those one sacrifices to—this is what is meant by *acting without clinging to one course.* Without fixed boundaries means being in communication with the Dao and not greatly at variance with it.

Who bears them up? This is called *without direction.* The myriad things are of one measure—this is being in accord with the Dao and not out of step with it.

Relying on completion, one does not know that end and beginning cannot be grasped. Thus, abiding in form, one does not perceive fullness and emptiness and does not understand that allotment is impermanent.

Years cannot be lifted away, so one wanders without vexation. Time cannot be halted, so one advances without stumbling. Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness—when one ends, another begins. This is simply the movement of heaven.

This is how we speak of the great Dao’s direction, how we discuss the principle of the myriad things—why should the heart be bound to matters of giving and receiving, pursuing and abandoning?

Swift as a gallop, they speak of how change and transformation shift imperceptibly—why should the heart be bound to the question of doing or not doing? They will transform of themselves—this is called *leaving transformation to its own course.*"

Yi Du’s commentary: "The principle of the myriad things is profoundly natural—neither doing nor not doing. Why then should one fix the mind on matters of giving and receiving, pursuing and abandoning?

*Extension* means surplus. *Bestowal* means allotment. Noble and base, few and many arise from forced distinctions, not the true principle of the Dao. The true principle of the Dao is simply one. Viewed through the Dao, noble is no addition, base is no diminution; many is no surplus, few is no deficiency—what distinction is there between noble and base, few and many?

Without private virtue means having no exclusive reliance on those one rules. Without private blessing means having no partial bestowal on those one sacrifices to."

The commentary below follows Lü’s explanation.

Xiang Dao’s commentary: "*Extension* refers to broad and level ground. Reversed, it becomes uneven. The division between level and uneven has no constancy—how is the alternation of noble and base different?

*Bestowal* is the function of benevolence. Gratitude is giving without considering it benevolence—how can the count of many and few be reckoned? Reversal and extension mean forgetting noble and base and not being burdened by names. Gratitude and bestowal mean forgetting few and many and not being burdened by profit. If one does not return to this truth, it has never been so."

Bi Xu’s commentary: "If one should receive but does not, what is to be done? If another abandons and I take, what is not to be done? Noble and base, great and small do not go beyond these two ends.

Noble and base have no fixed master but flow in endless reversal—this is the constant. The great Dao is utterly level, and the heart roams freely in self-contentment—this is penetration. Allotment has its measure, and few are grateful while many bestow—this is fitting. The ways of the world are uneven, and action or stillness adapt to change—this is principle."

Virtue made private loses its stern resolve; fortune made private cannot endure. With boundaries set, one’s reach is not vast; with fixed directions, the virtue of embracing all is lost—yet all these speak to the folly of prizing the noble and delighting in the base.

Forget the self, and there is no long or short; forget the heart, and there is no life or death; forget rank, and there is no fullness or emptiness; forget years, and one follows transformation; forget time, and one follows change. Forget the waxing and waning of growth and decay—then what could serve as beginning or end?

All things are born without cease, transform without cease; their shifts are swift as a gallop, their movements fleet as a race. Yin and yang, the four seasons—these are but self-transformations. How could one presume to intervene in what is or is not done?

Fu Qi says: Viewed through the Dao, there is no noble or base. Turn inward to seek within oneself, and one finds boundless ease—this is extension. If one binds oneself with notions of noble and base, right and wrong, one strays from the Dao. Bestowal has its measure, but to let go of bestowal is to be free of many or few. If one clings to a single course and is constrained by the measure of bestowal, one diverges from the Dao.

A state has its ruler, a sacrifice its altar—these are meant to illustrate that the heart takes the Dao as its master, not its private inclinations. When the heart is vast and boundless, without limit, there are no restrictive furrows. All things are complete within me—this is the virtue of embracing all. Without private attachments, who then would bear, support, or uphold?

No direction means no heart; no heart means no long or short, no life or death. Not relying on achievement is not to force completion. Fullness and emptiness follow the time; they cannot be fixed. Thus it is said: one does not take form as a position. Without past or present, years cannot be reckoned. Without going or coming, time cannot be halted.

The great principle is the Dao itself. Change and movement, shifting and turning—there is no time when this is not so. What is to be done? What is not to be done? All is left to creation, to spontaneity alone. Thus it is said: things will transform of themselves.

The River Earl, not yet understanding the principles of heaven and the nature of things, still harbored doubts and questioned the propriety of accepting or declining, pursuing or abandoning. The Lord of the Northern Sea explained that what the world calls noble and base, few and many, are but instances of reversal and extension, of bestowal and gratitude. If one clings to a single course, one strays from the Dao.

As a ruler’s virtue extends to all people, as the altar’s blessings are not private, so too does one clarify the boundlessness of the Dao and embrace all things. The life and death of things are but transformations of form, not the beginning or end of the Dao. Thus, completion has no fixed place. One does not cling to form as a position, nor resist its going or coming. The waxing and waning of all things are like this. Things are born as if racing, their mechanism unceasing. Let them transform of themselves—there is no need to intervene in what is or is not done, much less in accepting or declining, pursuing or uniting.

This teaches that in responding to things, one must be without heart—then life and death are no burden.

The River Earl asked: If so, then what is prized in the Dao?

The Lord of the Northern Sea replied: One who knows the Dao necessarily grasps principle; one who grasps principle necessarily understands adaptability; one who understands adaptability does not let things harm the self. The one of utmost virtue—fire cannot burn, water cannot drown, cold and heat cannot harm, birds and beasts cannot injure. This is not to say one resists them, but that one discerns safety and danger, finds peace in fortune and misfortune, is cautious in advance and retreat—nothing can cause harm. Thus it is said: heaven is within, man is without; virtue resides in heaven.

Know the conduct of heaven and man, rooted in heaven, positioned in attainment. To hesitate and bend or stretch, to return to essentials and speak of limits—

What is heaven? What is man?

The Lord of the Northern Sea replied: Oxen and horses have four legs—this is called heaven. To bridle a horse’s head or pierce an ox’s nose—this is called man. Thus it is said: Do not let man obliterate heaven; do not let habit obliterate fate; do not let attainment be sacrificed for fame. Guard this carefully and do not lose it—this is called returning to one’s true nature.

Guo’s commentary: Why value the Dao? Because it transforms of itself. One who knows the Dao knows one’s own inability. If one is incapable, how can one give birth to me? I am born of myself! The four limbs and hundred parts of the body form without one’s doing—what intention could there be after their formation? One who grasps this principle must be able to dispel excessive knowledge, relinquish emotions that obscure life, ride change and respond with adaptability, never letting things harm the self but always preserving wholeness. Thus, what the heart finds secure cannot be made perilous. Where intention meets no resistance, suffering cannot cause suffering. Though what the heart finds secure should not be violated, knowing it cannot be escaped, one rests in the encounters of fate. Examining advance and retreat as not one’s own, nothing can cause harm.

Heaven is within, and what naturally follows is without. The distinction between inner and outer is not made by design. Knowing the knowledge of the natural operates of itself, though one acts in the external, one constantly roots in heaven and positions in attainment. In harmony with the meeting, there is this transformation. To comprehend heaven and earth, to encompass the affairs of the myriad things, yet never lose the essential limit—thus the Dao of heaven and man is preserved whole.

Oxen and horses do not refuse bridling and piercing because it is the fixed mandate of heaven. If it accords with heaven’s mandate, then it is entrusted to human affairs while rooted in heaven. But if one acts excessively, driving and rushing without restraint, the principle of heaven is obliterated! If one does not follow what occurs of itself but forces action, where is fate to be found? What is attained has constancy; to pursue fame is to transgress.

Lü’s commentary: Letting things transform of themselves is the Dao. The Lord of the River did not understand, asking why value the Dao. The Lord of the Northern Sea explained that grasping principle and understanding adaptability, not letting things harm the self—these are the affairs of one who knows the Dao, not the ultimate embodiment of the Dao. As for water and fire not harming, cold and heat not assailing—this is how one who embodies the Dao naturally is. It is not that one resists them, but that one discerns safety and danger, is cautious in advance and retreat. Nothing can cause harm—this is merely knowing the Dao, grasping principle, and understanding adaptability. Finding peace in fortune and misfortune, knowing what cannot be altered and resting in it—this is heaven within. Discerning advance and retreat, knowing what people fear cannot but be feared—this is man without! Through this one enters virtue, though not yet able to be heaven without man, virtue resides in heaven.

Knowing the conduct of heaven and man, rooted in heaven, positioned in attainment—this is to go forth from heaven to man. To hesitate and bend or stretch, to return to essentials and speak of limits—this is to proceed from man to heaven. From “Do not let man obliterate heaven” to this point—speaking of returning to one’s true nature, how could one’s relation to the Dao be merely knowing it?

Yi Du’s commentary: This accords with Lü’s explanation.

Xiang Dao’s commentary: One who knows the Dao necessarily grasps principle; one who grasps principle necessarily understands adaptability. Adaptability means responding to things without intention and not losing equilibrium—how could one allow externals to injure the internal, letting things harm the self? To practice the Dao to this point is to be able to respond to others. To hesitate and bend or stretch is to return from man to heaven. To return to essentials and speak of limits—this is the discourse of the Lord of the Northern Sea. It begins with equalizing the great and small, unifying the noble and base; proceeds to discerning safety and danger, being cautious in advance and retreat; and concludes with clarifying heaven and man, returning to essentials and limits. For one who can equalize things can preserve the self; preserving the self, one can return to the Dao; and reaching the essential limit, one returns to one’s true nature.

Bixu’s commentary: One who knows the Dao of transformation and grasps the principle of life necessarily understands the adaptability of things. Thus one delights in wholeness without harm, discerns safety and danger, examines fortune and misfortune, and is prudent in advance and retreat. Therefore, one of virtue inwardly guards the principle of heaven and outwardly cultivates human affairs. Only then can position and enterprise be attained, and advance and retreat, exit and entry be at one’s discretion—one can return to the wondrous essentials and speak of the ultimate. Oxen and horses are the principle of heaven; to bridle and pierce them is to let man obliterate heaven. Hunger, thirst, galloping, and rushing are to let habit obliterate fate. Yellow horses and black oxen are to let attainment be sacrificed for fame. Guarding heaven and not losing it, one returns to simplicity without artifice.

Yongzhai said: This question is especially subtle. If one has already heard what creation does of itself, then one need not study the Dao. In Zhu Xi’s *Questions and Answers*, Liao Deming also posed this question. Master Zhu did not answer, likely finding it difficult to explain. Thus Zhuangzi here speaks of adaptability and clarifies it with the phrase “not letting things harm the self.”

The Dao is the general term. Principle is the principle inherent in each thing. Adaptability is what is at one’s discretion. Only with the complete substance of the Dao can one have this great function; understanding adaptability, one knows weight and lightness. *Bo* means to press close. One of utmost virtue certainly knows that every affair has its fate—how could things harm one? Yet one does not rely on this to press close to them. Just as one who knows fate does not stand beneath a crumbling wall, discerning safety and danger, being prudent in advance and retreat—this is the human heart within the heart of the Dao. How could one say it is all left to spontaneity?

Heaven within and man without—this is like the earlier passage: “The ruler follows the Dao of heaven; the minister follows the Dao of man.” Virtue resides in heaven—this refers to natural virtue. “Knowing the conduct of heaven and man”—this *knowing* arises from the human heart. Rooted in spontaneity and content with what is attained—this phrase again pertains to the heart of the Dao, the security of one’s position. To hesitate and bend or stretch—this refers to advancing and retreating each according to its principle, and this phrase again pertains to the human heart. Elucidating to this point, one reaches the utmost essentials of the Dao and the ultimate limits of principle.

Oxen and horses have four legs—this is received from spontaneity. Without bridling or piercing, they would have no use—this is a matter of the human heart. To obliterate heaven, obliterate fate, and pursue fame—this is the human heart flowing into peril!

"Three words suffice not"—this is a prohibitive phrase, meaning that if one knows heaven and knows man, and can guard this knowledge carefully without loss, then the heavenly principle is complete! This is called returning to one’s true nature, and thus human affairs are commanded by the heavenly principle.

From the beginning of this chapter to this point, there have been six questions, with answers like wind driving distant waves, gradually nearing and intensifying, until now they surge forth like snow-capped breakers, leaving one overwhelmed. Yet in an instant, all settles into stillness—wave-light stretches for ten thousand leagues, a single azure embracing the sky. When man sheds artifice and returns to truth, when the center of his shoulders is empty and limpid, it resembles this.

The man of utmost virtue, by understanding man to illuminate heaven, employs expedience to penetrate principle, discerns safety and peril, and carefully weighs withdrawal and engagement—what harm could external things bring him? Yet he never relies on this to act arrogantly toward others.

Heaven resides within, establishing the essence;
Man operates without, fulfilling its function.
Virtue lies in heaven, merging with the numinous and becoming unfathomable in all directions.

Embodying heaven and dwelling in virtue, one bends and stretches in accord with the world. Returning to the essential and ultimate words: do not lose your true nature. If this is so, then the Way of conducting oneself and others is fully realized! Thus, the River Lord’s mind became profoundly attuned, and he had no further questions.

Nowadays, scholars lack self-trust, their hearts clogged with doubts—many share the River Lord’s malady. If one could suddenly awaken at the words of Ruo of the Sea, as if clouds parting to reveal the moon, then with radiant clarity one would seek within and find sufficiency. What need would there be for further questions?

"Knowing the conduct of heaven and man"—*heaven* here should be *fu* (夫), a phonetic particle. *Positioned in attainment* (位乎得) should be *positioned in virtue* (位乎德), as the meaning of the text makes clear.

*Collected Explications of the Ocean of Meanings of the True Scripture of Southern Florescence*, Scroll Fifty-Three, concludes.

**Autumn Floods, Part Four**

The *kui* pitied the *xian*, the *xian* pitied the snake, the snake pitied the wind, the wind pitied the eye, and the eye pitied the heart.

The *kui* said to the *xian*: "I stride with a single foot, and none is my equal. Now you command ten thousand feet—how is this possible?"

The *xian* replied: "Not so. Have you not seen one who spits? When he sprays, the large droplets are like pearls, the small like mist, and those that fall in profusion cannot be numbered. Now I move by my heavenly mechanism, yet I know not how it is so."

The *xian* said to the snake: "I walk with many feet, yet I do not match you who have none. Why is this?"

The snake said: "How can the movement of the heavenly mechanism be altered? What need have I for feet?"

The snake said to the wind: "I move by flexing my spine and ribs, and thus I have some semblance of motion. Now you rise in a great rush from the Northern Sea and rush just as suddenly into the Southern Sea, yet you seem to have no substance at all. Why is this?"

The wind said: "Indeed. I rise in a great rush from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea, yet if one points at me, I am overcome; if one treads upon me, I am overcome. Nevertheless, to snap great trees and topple mighty halls—only I can do this. Thus, I achieve great victory through the accumulation of many small triumphs. To achieve such great victory—only the sage can do this."

**Guo’s Commentary:**
When things come to life, they do not know life and yet live. Life moves, yet who knows how it moves? Thus, the foot does not know how it walks, the eye does not know how it sees, and the heart does not know how it knows. Yet all attain their ends effortlessly! The rhythm of swiftness and slowness, the mirror of clarity and insight—some succeed, some fail, but none of this is of my doing. Yet some desire to claim possession of their bodies and boast of their abilities, thereby resisting the heavenly mechanism and harming the divine vessel. The perfected person knows that the heavenly mechanism cannot be altered, so they cast aside cleverness and foresight, acting without contrivance and allowing things to move of themselves. Thus, there is no movement that is not free and unbound. They follow the heavenly mechanism without contention, and so the small does not overcome. Riding the myriad things, guiding the uncarved block, allowing each talent to find its place and each thing to act of itself—then all under heaven are free and unbound. This is how the sage achieves great victory.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
The *kui*, with its single foot, pities the *xian* for its many feet; the *xian*, with its many feet, pities the snake for its lack of feet; the snake, moving by flexing its spine and ribs, pities the wind for its great rush from the Northern Sea to the Southern Sea. From this, we may infer how the eye, bound to this sight and that, pities the heart, which sees nothing yet reaches everywhere. The *kui* finds it easy to pity the *xian*’s difficulty with many feet; the *xian* finds it easy to pity the snake’s difficulty with no feet. Yet the movement of the heavenly mechanism is such that none knows how it is so—how then can difficulty or ease lie in the presence or absence of feet? From this, we know that the wind, the eye, and the heart all arise from spontaneity. How could the River Lord’s petty calculations of high and low, few and many compare with this? The wind achieves great victory through the small not overcoming, yet the eye and the heart, which employ their spirit far beyond the wind, cannot attain this. What is called "seeing without seeing, knowing without knowing" is the great victory that governs the myriad things. Is this true knowledge? No!

**Yi Du’s Commentary:**
The *kui*, with one foot, is precarious; the *xian*, with ten thousand feet, is secure; the snake, with no feet, is swift; the wind, without form, moves and transforms. The eye is bound to forms and appearances, while the heart enters the realm of sensory contact. To pity many feet with one foot is to pity the many with the few. To pity swift movement with slow is to pity the many with the nonexistent. The snake, burdened by its form, pities the wind’s ability to move and transform. The wind, lacking sight, pities the eye’s ability to see. The eye, enslaved by things, pities the heart’s centrality and effortless action. To walk with a halting step is as precarious as the spray of spittle—who could expect it to be like pearls or mist? All arise from the spontaneity of the heavenly mechanism. Thus, the many feet move slowly, the footless move swiftly, and those who walk securely without feet—all are but the heavenly mechanism at work. The wind rises from the Northern Sea and enters the Southern Sea, emerging from yin and returning to yang. Though it cannot overcome when pointed at or trodden upon, it can snap trees and topple halls—this is its victory. It is like the sage’s learning, which reaches the level of the wind and cannot be surpassed. From the *kui*’s pity for its single foot to the wind, this is the end of the matter. For only when there is heart and eye does pity arise. The eye gazes outward, the heart stirs within, and so one longs for this or that without end. But when there is no heart and no eye, as the wind is to things, then there is no pity. Who but the sage can attain this?

**Xiang Dao’s Commentary:**
When feet are of use, one foot cannot match the many, so the *kui* pities the *xian*. When feet are a burden, many feet cannot match the absence of feet, so the *xian* pities the snake. The snake, though it has form, sees the formless as insufficient and so pities the wind. The wind, though it rushes boundlessly, finds direction constraining and so pities the eye. The eye’s function is merely to see, while the heart governs all. Thus, it pities the heart.

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:**
Some things overcome the many with the few, the existent with the nonexistent—all is the work of the heavenly mechanism and the timing of fate. No force can alter it, and no principle can fully fathom it. Does this not describe the mutual pity of the *kui*, *xian*, snake, and wind? Nothing sees like the eye, nothing knows like the heart. The eye sees but does not discriminate—it conceals its clarity. The heart knows but does not speak—it veils its wisdom. This is how the small does not overcome and becomes great victory.

**Yong Zhai’s Commentary:**
From one foot to no feet, all move by the spontaneity of the heavenly mechanism—this is marvelous writing. The passage then compares the *xian*’s many feet to human spittle, and in the end returns to the wind, leaving the heart and eye unspoken. This is the marvel of marvels in the art of transformation.

Building upon the notion of the small not overcoming yet becoming great victory, then which of the myriad things could ever stand beyond the workings of creation? After the River Spirit and the Ocean Spirit concluded their dialogue, Master Nanhua further expounded the preceding idea, saying: the *kui*, *xian*, and snake, with their varying numbers of feet—few, many, or none—pity one another in their forms. The heart and eye, with their inner and outer labors and leisures, pity one another in their functions. All these are but the deluded sentiments of things! Only the wind possesses form yet does not hinder its pointing and flowing; it is formless yet achieves great victory. In its function, it moves and transforms the myriad things; in its non-function, it whirls into the sea like tumbleweed. For the breath of creation merely inhales and exhales, returning to creation itself—this illustrates how the sage bends and stretches with the world, embodying both form and function, excelling in both action and withdrawal, and ultimately never losing the Dao. People see its smallness as no match and belittle it, yet when it accumulates into great victory, it is not merely about uprooting trees or tearing off roofs—how could it have any intention to conquer things? Moved by the heavenly mechanism, it is simply so of itself. Compared to the River Spirit and the Ocean Spirit debating nobility and baseness, fewness and abundance, greatness and smallness, essence and coarseness, it is like beings of different kinds pitying one another with deluded sentiments, unaware that every thing possesses the principle of spontaneity, leaving no room for love or hatred between them. The fewness or abundance of physical forms, the slowness or swiftness of movement and stillness—each abides in its own nature, and none falls short of the Dao. This is why the sage’s way of dwelling in the world is never inappropriate.

Some may question why the later passage on the mutual pity of the minute and deluded ends with the wind, leaving the themes of the eye’s pity and the heart’s pity unaddressed. The doubt is resolved by noting that only with eyes and a heart can there be pity—this interpretation is sound. Confucius traveled to Kuang, where men of Song (or Wei) besieged him several times, yet he continued playing the zither and singing without pause. Zilu entered and asked, “Why is the Master so joyful?” Confucius replied, “Come, let me tell you. I have long avoided adversity, yet it has not been averted—this is fate. I have long sought success, yet it has not been attained—this is timing. In the eras of Yao and Shun, there were no destitute people, not because of wisdom’s gain; in the eras of Jie and Zhou, there were no successful people, not because of wisdom’s loss—such is the way of circumstances. The fisherman who travels by water without avoiding dragons displays the courage of his trade; the hunter who travels by land without avoiding rhinoceroses and tigers displays the courage of his trade; the hero who faces crossed blades and regards death as life displays the courage of his trade. But to know that adversity is a matter of fate, that success is a matter of timing, and to face great peril without fear—this is the courage of the sage. Rest easy, for my fate is constrained.”

Shortly after, the armored soldiers advanced and said, “We mistook you for Yang Hu, so we surrounded you. Now that we know you are not, we beg to withdraw.” Guo Xiang’s commentary: To clarify the inevitability of timing and fate, he used the example of seeking to avoid adversity. Circumstances unfold as they do—there is no need to trouble the heart over success or failure. The fisherman’s, hunter’s, and hero’s courage each has its place, but the sage is at ease in all. Knowing that fate is not self-determined, he does not exert his heart; abiding in fate, he is carefree in all circumstances. Lü Huiqing’s commentary: Confucius’s fear in Kuang, his composure between life and death without dread, and the eventual withdrawal of the Kuang people demonstrate that those who cannot relinquish knowledge and habit and worry over life and death not only gain nothing but only burden their hearts. Yan Du’s commentary: Success and failure lie with oneself; timing and fate lie with Heaven. Failing to attain success, one adapts; unable to avoid adversity, one endures. It is like the saying, “Wealth without arrogance, poverty without resentment.” The ancients never let success or failure burden them; each abided in their time. Avoiding dragons, rhinoceroses, and tigers, or facing blades—these are the minor braveries of one-sidedness. But facing great peril without fear is the great courage of the sage. One who embodies all three, like Mencius’s courage in righteousness, may be compared to this. Confucius told Zilu to rest easy, for his fate was governed by the Creator—what could the men of Kuang do to him? Soon after, the armored soldiers withdrew, proving that one who attains the Dao transcends life and death—Confucius had mastered this.

Bi Xu’s commentary: When Confucius traveled to Kuang and was besieged by the men of Song (or Wei), it was as if all things pointed and flowed to overcome him. Yet when they realized their mistake and withdrew, this was the great victory. Yong Zhai’s commentary: This passage speaks of timing and fate as natural, not subject to human effort—how could one who knows the Dao fear? The comparison of the fisherman, hunter, and hero to the sage is also fitting. “Rest easy,” and now there is no need to speak further.

This chapter clarifies that life and death are a matter of fate, and success and failure are a matter of timing. Thus, the noble person does not stand beneath a crumbling wall, nor does he seek life at the expense of benevolence. Facing great peril without fear, knowing that fate is constrained, he fulfills his human duties in ordinary times and accepts Heaven’s decree in such moments. For one who inwardly possesses the most noble and abundant, external success or failure, profit or harm cannot move his heart. The eventual withdrawal of the armored soldiers, realizing their mistake, demonstrates the principle that humans cannot overcome Heaven and that the weak can restrain the strong. Without the sage’s penetrating insight into principle and self-knowing clarity, how could this be achieved?

Lu Deming’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* records Sima Biao’s old commentary: “Song” should be “Wei.” Kuang was a town in Wei. Most modern editions mistakenly write “Song.”

Gongsun Long asked Wei Mou: “In my youth, I studied the Dao of the former kings; in my maturity, I understood the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I harmonized sameness and difference, separated hardness and whiteness, affirmed the un-affirmable, and validated the un-validatable...”

I had once exhausted the wisdom of all schools and silenced the eloquence of every debater—I believed myself to be utterly enlightened. Yet now, hearing Zhuangzi’s words, I am overwhelmed and bewildered. Is it that my reasoning falls short? Or that my understanding cannot match his? My beak is sealed shut; I dare ask for his method."

Prince Mou leaned against his desk, sighed deeply, looked up to the sky, and laughed: "Have you never heard of the frog in the broken well? It boasted to the sea turtle, saying: ‘How joyful I am! I leap and dance upon the well’s railing, rest in the chinks of its crumbling walls. When I plunge into the water, it supports my armpits and props up my chin; when I tread in the mud, it buries my feet and ankles. Looking around at the shrimps, crabs, and tadpoles, none can compare to me. Moreover, to command the waters of this single ravine and revel in the pleasures of this broken well—what more could one desire? Why not come in and see for yourself?’

The sea turtle had not yet placed its left foot inside when its right knee was already stuck. It retreated cautiously and told the frog of the sea: ‘A distance of a thousand *li* is insufficient to describe its vastness; a height of a thousand *ren* cannot measure its depth. In the time of Yu, floods lasted nine years out of ten, yet the sea’s waters did not increase; in the time of Tang, droughts lasted seven years out of eight, yet its shores did not recede. Neither the passage of time nor the measure of quantity alters it—this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea.’

Upon hearing this, the frog in the broken well was stunned, dismayed, and lost in self-doubt. Now, if one’s knowledge cannot grasp the bounds of right and wrong and yet still wishes to examine Zhuangzi’s words, it is like commanding a mosquito to carry a mountain or a centipede to ford a river—it will surely fail. And if one’s understanding cannot fathom the subtleties of his discourse yet seeks only momentary advantage, is this not the same as the frog in the broken well?

Moreover, he leaps through the Yellow Springs and ascends the Great Vast, unbound by south or north, dissolving into the four directions, sinking into the unfathomable. Unrestrained by east or west, he begins in profound obscurity and returns to the Great Thoroughfare. Yet you seek to measure him with narrow scrutiny and probe him with debate—this is truly like using a tube to observe the heavens or a awl to mark the earth. Is this not petty? Begone!

Have you not heard of the young men of Shouling who went to learn the walking style of Handan? Before mastering the state’s art, they lost even their original gait and could only crawl home. If you do not leave now, you will forget your former ways and lose your former learning."

Gongsun Long’s mouth gaped open, unable to close; his tongue rose, unable to descend. He fled in haste.

Thus, those who lose their footing in learning and practice crawl home in defeat; those who pursue knowledge at the expense of their true nature are utterly bereft of the Way.

Yuan Qi says: "Nine years of flood, seven years of drought—if true, humankind would perish!" Yet Zhuangzi speaks of ten years with nine floods and eight years with seven droughts, ascending to the heavens above or descending to the Yellow Springs below, so lofty and distant is his vision. *Shi* is synonymous with *shi* (release). *Jie* means to penetrate. To sink into the unfathomable is to enter deeply. To begin in profound obscurity is to stand before the limitless. To return to the Great Thoroughfare is to revert to the Ultimate Way.

To exhaust the Way with the clarity of petty scrutiny and probe it with verbal debate—is this not small-minded? The parable of losing one’s gait in Handan is especially apt! Gongsun Long, a master of disputation from Zhao, could reconcile sameness and difference, separate hardness and whiteness, confound the hundred schools, and exhaust the rivers of argument—yet upon hearing Zhuangzi’s words, he was struck dumb and lost all composure. Those who chase external learning while forgetting their original truth often meet such an end.

Thus, Wei Mou explained to the well-frog and the sea turtle that their perspectives differed, so they might understand the origin of right and wrong and where subtle discourse resides—only then could one ascend to the heavens or plumb the depths. To be *shi*-like in all four directions is to begin in profound obscurity and merge with the void. To return to the Great Thoroughfare is to become one with the Way.

Now, to attempt to fathom Zhuangzi’s Way with mere trivialities and argumentation is no different from the youths of Shouling who learned to walk in Handan—only to crawl home in the end. *Yuzi* means "young ones." Here ends *Fascicle Fifty-Four of the Ocean of Meanings in the Southern Florescence True Sutra*. *Fascicle Fifty-Five of the Ocean of Meanings in the Southern Florescence True Sutra* begins.

Master Chu Boxiu of Wulin’s *Exegesis on "Autumn Floods" (Fifth Chapter)*

Zhuangzi was angling in the Pu River when the King of Chu dispatched two grand ministers to approach him first, saying: "I wish to burden you with the affairs of the realm." Zhuangzi held his rod without turning, and said: "I have heard that in Chu there is a divine tortoise, dead now three thousand years, which the king wraps in silk and stores in a casket upon his ancestral altar. For this tortoise, would it prefer to die and leave its bones to be venerated, or to live and drag its tail through the mud?" The two ministers as one said: "It would prefer to live and drag its tail through the mud." Zhuangzi said: "Go then! I too shall drag my tail through the mud."

Guo Xiang’s commentary: To prefer living and dragging one’s tail through the mud is for each nature to find its own repose.
Lü Huiqing’s commentary: Zhuangzi, who knows nothing of death, speaks thus to rescue an age that pursues profit and forgets life. Only these two ministers’ understanding suffices for this.
Yidu’s commentary: Zhuangzi cites the divine tortoise to decline the King of Chu’s summons, for he does not wish to seek wealth and honor at the cost of his life.
Bixu’s commentary: Thus one knows that carriages and caps are external things, not inherent to one’s nature or destiny.
Yongzhai’s note: The analogy of dying to leave one’s bones or living to drag one’s tail is truly extraordinary. Zhuangzi’s refusal of the summons through the tortoise metaphor is profoundly apt, for worthy and talented men who resolve difficulties and plan harmony for the state are indeed indispensable—yet once their work is done and their merit complete, their lives may not be spared, just as the tortoise’s divinity serves man. Formerly, Tao Hongjing painted two oxen in response to an imperial edict: one constrained by whips and ropes, the other roaming freely among water and grass—this conveys the same meaning.

When Huizi was chief minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to visit him. Someone told Huizi: "Zhuangzi is coming to replace you as minister." Thereupon Huizi grew fearful and searched the state for three days and three nights. Zhuangzi went to see him and said: "In the south there is a bird called the *yuanchu*—do you know it? The *yuanchu* sets out from the Southern Sea and flies to the Northern Sea; it alights only on the *wutong* tree, eats only bamboo fruit, and drinks only sweet springs. Then a crow, having obtained a rotting rat, saw the *yuanchu* pass by, looked up, and cried: *'Ha!'* Now do you wish to frighten me with your state of Liang?"

Guo Xiang’s commentary: "Searched the state" means mustering troops and ordering ranks. "Do you wish to frighten me with your state of Liang" means that creatures’ tastes differ, and each has its own limits.
Lü Huiqing’s commentary: What Zhuangzi treads is like what Wei Mou spoke of—nothing can obstruct him. That he compares himself to the divine tortoise and the *yuanchu*, and Huizi to the crow, and Liang to a rotting rat—is this not fitting?
Yidu’s commentary: The *yuanchu* is of the phoenix kind; its aspirations are grand, it perches only on choice trees, eats only choice fruit, and drinks only choice water—it is a noble bird. The crow is a filthy bird. "Ha!" is the sound of repelling things.
Bixu’s commentary: Huizi’s fear and search throughout the state show that those who cling to power cannot share authority with others. To be arrogant in wealth and prominence—how is this different from a gull seizing a rotting rat and crying *"Ha!"*?
Yongzhai’s note: Zhuangzi and Huizi were the closest of friends; this incident likely never occurred, and was only playful mockery. *Lianshi* refers to bamboo fruit. "Searched" should be written as *sou*, as Guo Xiang’s commentary confirms. Cheng Xuanying’s gloss, "searched the state to find Zhuangzi," follows Yidu’s interpretation, but the meaning is rather shallow, arising from a misreading of the character’s components. How could a crow that cries *"Ha!"* over a rotting rat be worthy of speaking of the taste of bamboo fruit and sweet springs, or the lofty purity of the *wutong* tree’s perch?

Zhuangzi and Huizi strolled upon the Hao Bridge. Zhuangzi said: "The minnows swim to and fro at ease—this is the joy of fish." Huizi said: "You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?" Zhuangzi said: "You are not me—how do you know that I do not know the joy of fish?" Huizi said: "I am not you, so of course I do not know you. But you are certainly not a fish, so your not knowing the joy of fish is complete!" Zhuangzi said: "Let us return to the beginning. When you said, 'How do you know the joy of fish?' you already knew that I knew it and asked me. I know it here upon the Hao."

Guo Xiang’s commentary: Zhuangzi says, "You are not me, yet you can know that I am not a fish; thus, I am not a fish, yet I can know the joy of fish." Huizi takes his original words and engages in sophistry to refute him. Tracing Huizi’s original words: if one is not a fish, there is no way to know it. Now, you are not me, yet you say, "How do you know the joy of fish?"—this shows you know that I am not a fish. Then, for all who know one another, this knowledge does not depend on being the thing itself. Following your words, "How do you know?"—you already know what I know. Yet now you ask me again: I simply know it here upon the Hao—why must I enter the water?
Lü Huiqing’s commentary: Returning to the beginning: Huizi says, "You are not a fish, so how do you know the joy of fish?"—this means, "You are not me, so you certainly know that I do not know the joy of fish; thus, I am not a fish, yet I can know the joy of fish." This is already knowing that I know it and asking me. I know it here upon the Hao—there is no need to become a fish to know it.
Yidu’s commentary: Fish dwell in the depths and are content; the *Classic* says, "In fish, one obtains a plan"—this means knowing the fish deeply and seizing them. Humans are born on land and are at ease on land; fish are born in water and are at ease in water. Only after fulfilling one’s own nature can one fulfill the nature of things—this is how one knows the joy of fish. Huizi, ignorant of this, forces an argument—this is no way to distinguish right from wrong.

Zhuangzi sought to trace matters back to their root, desiring that they be viewed through the principle of reciprocity—thus, "All day long, I know it here upon the Hao." Extending from my own joy upon the Hao, one knows the joy of fish.

*Xiang Dao’s commentary*: Observed in terms of form, the myriad things and I share no common shape; observed in terms of principle, the myriad things and I share no differing nature. Huizi viewed things by form, hence his claim, "You are not a fish, so how do you know the joy of fish?" Zhuangzi viewed things by nature, hence his knowing the feelings of fish though he was not a fish. For when small and great are equalized, noble and base forgotten, then heaven and earth endure, and the myriad things, though multitudinous, are one with me. Thus, dwelling here suffices to know the delights of what is there; abiding in the manifest suffices to know the joy of the hidden.

*Bixu’s commentary*: In my own carefree wandering, I perceive the bearing of fish. Huizi saw humans and fish as distinct, thus raising objections—this misses the purport of *equalizing things*. Huizi did not understand Zhuangzi, and the matter was indeed so; but did Zhuangzi not understand fish? In truth, the question Huizi originally posed—"How do you know the joy of fish?"—was Huizi, who did not know fish, asking Zhuangzi. Thus, only Zhuangzi knew the leisurely swimming of the minnows and their joy upon the Hao! For though the joy of fish and the joy of humans differ, their carefree wandering is one. *Yong Qi* says: Tracing back to the root means returning to the beginning. You first asked, "You are not a fish, so how do you know the joy of fish?"—this means you knew me before posing the question. Since you knew me thus, I likewise knew fish thus upon the Hao.

This passage, with its dialogue between the River Lord and the Ocean Spirit, resembles the *Transmission of the Lamp*’s exchange between National Preceptor Zhong and the question of "preaching to the insentient" and "mindlessly attaining Buddhahood." Consider Dahui’s words: "This old fellow is stubborn, and he’s met a monk just as stubborn—stuck fast in questioning! He speaks of 'household affairs vast, gates wide, waves broad, life-root severed'—Zhuangzi would have sufficed with these few phrases."

Li Shibiao’s discussion states: Nothing is without the Dao, so what choice is there for me? Nothing lacks the sufficiency of heaven, so what possession is there for me? Though things and I are thus conjoined, there is a knowing that arises without expectation, a wondrous principle silently apprehended by spirit—something received that cannot be escaped beforehand. This is how Zhuangzi knew the joy of fish upon the Hao. For when they emerge and leap, swim and glide, free from the snares of nets, untroubled by thoughts of damp or dry, at ease within the bounds of a single stream—is this not the joy of fish? And if this is the joy of fish, why wait for Nanhua to know it? The joy of fish lies in the Dao, not in the water; what Nanhua knew lay in joy, not in fish. Fish forget the water, so their joy is complete. Humans forget the fish, so their knowing is unified.

Here, Zhuangzi would have been wordless, Huizi would have had no question, yet this discourse arose. Without questions, profound words have no place to alight; without words, the wondrous Dao has no means to appear. It is simply to loosen the fetters of later ages that separate things and self into two! If things are taken as having their own "thingness," then Zhuangzi, not being a fish, could not know the joy of fish. If I am taken as having my own "I," then you, not being me, could not know that I do not know the joy of fish. Knowing and not knowing are but the branches of the Dao—this is why one must trace back to the root. Those who know neither root nor branch—ancients have spoken of this: eyes like ears, ears like noses, noses like rivers—what is within me is thus. Seeing life as death, oneself as fish, swine as humans, humans as swine—what is in things is thus. If so, then everywhere is the ultimate wandering, and nothing is not a wondrous realm; every thing is true joy, and nothing lacks heavenly harmony. Why single out the joy of the minnows upon the Hao?

I know that Zhuangzi and the fish were never truly divided. Only those who understand that supreme joy is no-joy, true knowing is no-knowing, can speak of this. Those who understand their own nature can penetrate things, so nothing in the world conceals its feelings; those who obscure their own nature cannot know others, so they are often hindered by things. Zhuangzi knew fish by meeting them with his nature; Huizi, not knowing Zhuangzi, questioned him by form.

At first reading, none fail to admire Huizi’s eloquent disputation, seeing Nanhua’s fortress as vulnerable. Yet upon hearing the words "trace back to the root," the learning of five carts has no room for objection—thus Huizi’s root is revealed! Throughout the *Classic*, efforts are made to correct Huizi’s errors, but none are as incisive as these two words. For if one seeks among friends and finds that one’s nature is fundamentally attuned to the shared principle of things, then self and other are without barrier in great feeling, movement and stillness both return to the supreme principle—why wait to enter the water to know fish?

Re-examining the *Classic*’s text, it says Huizi did not fully know the joy of fish—*fully* meaning *necessarily*, as in utterly ignorant of the joy of fish. Bixu titled the chapter "Joy Fully," which seems to miss the original purport. Here, it is proposed to title it "Tracing Back to the Root," which better accords with the *Classic*’s intent.

This passage, titled "Autumn Floods," sets forth the dialogue between the River Lord and the Ocean Spirit to illustrate the principle of fine and coarse, great and small, clarifying the observation of the Dao, things, functions, and delights. Each follows its nature, without noble or base; success and failure, gain and loss are but the fitting of the times. Through repeated debate and refutation, it ultimately returns to "do not use the human to destroy the heavenly, do not use the conventional to destroy the destined"—thus, seeking within the bounds of one’s nature is sufficient. This is called returning to one’s true self. There is something beyond what words, thoughts, and discernment can reach.

Next, it discusses Kui, Kui, the snake, and the wind cherishing one another, likening it to people who take their talents and knowledge as grounds for shame and do not awaken to the unalterable heavenly mechanism—that the small cannot overcome the great is the true victory. Once this principle is understood, each thing is sufficient in its allotment—what is there to cherish?

Without cherishing, there is no longing; thus, the impulse to envy subsides, and the intent to discriminate dissolves—is this not the ultimate essential? When Confucius traveled to Kuang and faced peril without fear, he knew that fate was ordained by the Creator and not subject to the control of the people of Kuang. Had he been thwarted by adversity or disheartened by obstruction, how could one perceive the courage of the sage?

The well-frog and the sea-turtle reprise the earlier discourse of the River Spirit and Ruo of the Sea, culminating in the understanding of principle and the discernment of adaptability—nothing can harm one who has attained this. It speaks of the world’s turbid沉沦, its vision narrow and shallow: though aware of sages and worthies ahead, they stubbornly strive to emulate, yet like lesser students who, in imitating others’ conduct, lose their own footing—seeking what lies beyond their measure with what falls short of it. Such pursuit not only yields no benefit but leads to ruin.

Consider the divine tortoise, which would rather drag its tail through the mud than be enshrined, or the owl, which holds no attachment to the rotting mouse—both lament the shallowness of the age and the obstruction of the Dao’s course. The discourse concludes with Zhuangzi and Huizi’s debate by the Hao River, affirming that the nature of self and other is fundamentally the same, merely estranged by form and thus unaware of one another. When united by nature, joy is shared alike; thus, what one finds contentment in, one may know the fish’s joy as well—nothing strange in this. Yet those who quibble over trivial distinctions while forgetting the root of nature and destiny—*that* is truly strange!

These words not only pierce Huizi’s deepest ills but also serve as a warning to those in the world who, in studying the words of a single master, take smug comfort in their own narrow views—no different from the River Spirit’s self-satisfaction in its waters. Thus, the chapter’s purport is brought to a close.

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin on *"Supreme Joy"*

Is there a supreme joy in the world? Is there a way to preserve one’s life? What should one do, and on what should one rely? What should one avoid, and where should one dwell? What should one pursue, and what should one abandon? What brings joy, and what brings aversion?

What the world reveres are wealth, honor, longevity, and goodness; what it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful forms, and harmonious sounds. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and misfortune; what it suffers are the inability to rest at ease, the lack of rich flavors, the want of fine garments, the absence of beauty, and the deprivation of music. Those who fail to attain these grow deeply anxious and fearful. How foolish they are in their attachment to form!

The wealthy exhaust themselves in toil, amassing fortunes they cannot fully use—how estranged they are from their true nature! The honored pass their days and nights in ceaseless calculation, weighing right and wrong—how distant they are from their own form! From birth, humans are born with worry; the long-lived grow ever more restless, their prolonged anxiety never ending—what bitter suffering! How far they have strayed from their true nature!

The resolute strive for the world’s approval, yet this is insufficient to preserve their lives. Do I truly know whether such "goodness" is good or not? If it is good, it fails to preserve life; if it is not good, it may yet save others. Thus it is said: "When loyal admonitions go unheeded, withdraw and do not contend." When Master Wu contested, his body was destroyed; had he not contested, his name would not have endured. Is there truly goodness, or is there none?

Now, as for the world’s pursuits and its joys—do I know whether its joy is truly joy, or truly not joy? I observe the world’s so-called joys: all rush forward in haste, as if compelled by necessity, yet all call it joy. I find no joy in it, nor do I find it joyless. Is there truly joy, or is there none?

I hold that non-action (*wuwei*) is true joy—yet it is what the world deems the greatest suffering. Thus, supreme joy is no-joy, and supreme praise is no-praise. Right and wrong in the world cannot truly be settled. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong. Supreme joy and the preservation of life lie only in non-action—let me attempt to explain.

Heaven is clear through non-action; Earth is tranquil through non-action. When the two unite in non-action, the myriad things transform. Vast and boundless, they emerge from nowhere! Sprouting and flourishing, yet without form! The ten thousand things thrive in abundance, all growing from non-action. Thus it is said: "Heaven and Earth act through non-action, yet nothing is left undone." Who among humans can attain non-action?

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
Only when joy is forgotten does joy become complete; only when joy is complete does the self endure. If one assumes there is joy, supreme joy knows no delight; if one assumes there is no joy, the self endures without sorrow. In choosing among these eight—reliance, avoidance, dwelling, pursuit, abandonment, joy, and aversion—none suffice to preserve life. Only by making no choice and following what one encounters can wholeness be attained. Indulgence in rich flavors and sensual pleasures harms the nature though it does no harm to the form; yet people fret over their absence—how foolish! To cherish one’s form is simply to be content. To embrace one’s form is to find fulfillment within. Only by relinquishing life can one forget sorrow; only by forgetting sorrow can life become joyful. When life is joyful, then form is one’s own, wealth is one’s possession, and honor is one’s glory.

The resolute strive for goodness, yet it is insufficient to preserve life—goodness, when excessive, fails to aid others. "Withdraw and do not contend"—only the virtue of the Mean achieves this. Whether there is goodness or not, one should follow the natural course as a guiding principle. Those who rush toward their joys do not shrink from death. I do not know whether their joy is joy or not—only by being without attachment and letting things take their course can one proceed.

The joy of non-action lies solely in freedom from sorrow. The world clamors for pleasure, prizing beauty and goodness as praise. Right and wrong in the world cannot be settled, but through non-action and following the natural course, right and wrong settle themselves. When the people are settled, one’s own life nears preservation—just as Heaven and Earth are naturally clear and tranquil, not through any contrivance. Thus, the myriad things transform. If one acts with intent, there will be times of stagnation. That which "emerges from nowhere" emerges of itself; that which "has no form" grows of itself. When humans attain non-action, joy arrives without joy!

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary** is brief and not discussed here.

**Lin Yi’s Sole Commentary:**
Without joy, there is no sorrow; without self, there is no death. To seek supreme joy without sorrow, or to preserve life without death—this is impossible. Then what should one do, and on what rely? What should one avoid, and where dwell? What should one pursue, and what abandon? What brings joy, and what brings aversion? Nevertheless, what is there to do or not do? What is there to rely on or not rely on? Simply follow the times and accord with principle, without intention—this is perfection.

The world reveres wealth, honor, longevity, and goodness, and despises poverty, lowliness, early death, and misfortune. It takes bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, and sensual pleasures as joy; when these are unattainable, it suffers and grows anxious. In this way of nurturing form, how foolish! The wealthy are burdened by their fortunes; the honored are burdened by their rank. The longer one lives, the longer one’s worries—how far one strays from the principle of nature and destiny!

The resolute forget themselves in pursuit of fame. If this is deemed not good, it may yet save others. To save others without losing oneself—this is perfect goodness. Thus, the ancients admonished loyally but did not contend when unheeded. Like Wu Zixu, who contended and harmed himself—yet had he not contended, his name would not have endured. Is there truly goodness, or is there none?

The world’s pursuits are not true action; its joys are not true joy. True action is non-action, which enables action; true joy is no-joy, which enables all joy. Do I know whether the world’s joys are truly joy, or truly not joy?

The world delights in action; the sage delights in non-action. Non-action is indeed joyous, yet the world deems it great suffering and cannot practice it. Thus, the highest joy is no-joy; the highest praise is no-praise. Right and wrong arise from action; only through non-action do right and wrong settle themselves. Without right, without wrong—where does the heart not find joy? Where does the self not abide?

Serenity is the virtue of Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth do not rely on serenity. When the two non-actions converge, the myriad things transform. The Dao emerges to become things; things enter to become forms. There is no source from which it emerges, nor is there a form that can be seen. Each has its own master, all emerging and entering through non-action. Non-action that leaves nothing undone—this is the Way of Heaven and Earth. Man stands between Heaven and Earth; how can he not practice non-action?

Chen Bixu’s note: If one clings to the eight aims—position, wealth, and the like—such joy does not necessarily reach the self. It has yet to give rise to what the world reveres. What one delights in are all external things that come and go; they cannot be grasped. Now, to grieve and fear over what one cannot obtain—what is this if not folly?

Gold, jade, carriages, and caps are distant from the body; how can long-enduring toil bring glory? Those resolute men who dare to act yet cannot escape harm do so because the world sees their goodness. This is merely knowing goodness as goodness—yet it is already not goodness. The name of goodness cannot be grasped; it lies solely in preserving wholeness. The world’s pursuits and joys are frantic, as if one cannot help but chase them. Thus, they take dust and delusion as joy and deem no-joy and no-praise as suffering. Is right and wrong truly settled? Only by guarding what lies within one’s nature, unchanging in one’s true essence, can right and wrong be determined. When the two non-actions converge, tranquility arises, and all beauty follows. If superiors and inferiors act without harmony, the qi of harmony is obstructed.

At the dawn of creation, there was originally no emergence, no entry, no form, no image. Yet the myriad things all arise from the primordial qi’s boundless vastness—what is called the Creator is no-thing, yet things create themselves. People, with their foresight, cannot be without intention; how can they achieve non-action?

Lin’s *Yanzhai Oral Teachings* states: The four phrases beginning with "what to do, what to rely on" follow the same structure as Qu Yuan’s *Divination*. The next section on wealth, honor, longevity, and goodness—four passages of the same intent—all show how external things harm the self. After discussing the first three, the final passage on resolute men clarifies this, shifting the phrasing—such is the art of composition. "To withdraw and comply" means to retreat and observe. "To contend is to harm the body; not to contend is to fail to establish a name"—these two lines expose the ways of the world. To harm the body for the sake of a name cannot be called goodness. The whole world scrambles, frantically intent on seizing things. I delight in non-action, yet the world deems it great suffering—thus, joy, praise, right, and wrong are truly unsettled. Only non-action can settle them.

Chu’s *Superficial Insights* says: Living in an illusory realm, what is hard to attain is joy; what is hard to preserve is life. Thus, the opening of this chapter shows that the highest joy and preserving the self cannot both be grasped, urging one to rest in one’s natural lot without clinging. In the space between going and staying—what is there to delight in or detest? What the world delights in—wealth, honor, longevity, goodness, rich flavors, and sensual pleasures—yet the hidden mechanisms of fortune and misfortune are unfathomable. Goodness cannot be constant. What one suffers from—poverty, lowliness, early death, and evil—comes from unfulfilled desires. Yet if one wanders to the origin of things, one may forget the self; how can external burdens reach one?

Now observe: the wealthy wear themselves out with illness; the honored are consumed by worries of success and failure; the long-lived are burdened by prolonged anxieties over death—all alienate the body and stray far from the Dao. The resolute who cannot preserve themselves are no different. Thus, to admonish loyally without contention may gradually awaken understanding, so the ruler makes no missteps, and the minister fulfills his duty—this is the flourishing of ruler and minister. As for Wu Zixu, who harmed his body through contention yet thereby established his name—is there truly goodness in this, or is there none? Observe the world’s joys: are they truly joy, or not joy? I hold that non-action is indeed joyous, yet the world deems it great suffering—thus, its inclinations are clear. Only by knowing that the highest joy is no-joy and the highest praise is no-praise can one be at peace with non-action and thereby settle the world’s right and wrong. Those who seek the highest joy and the preservation of the self—only non-action comes close.

Heaven and Earth practice non-action and are serene; thus, the myriad things transform. If man can practice non-action, how can things fail to transform?

When Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi came to offer condolences. Zhuangzi was squatting, drumming on a basin and singing. Huizi said, "To live with someone, raise a child to adulthood, and grow old together—if you do not weep at her death, it would be enough. Yet you drum on a basin and sing—is this not excessive?" Zhuangzi replied, "Not so. When she first died, how could I alone not feel sorrow? Yet examining her beginning, she originally had no life. Not only no life—she originally had no form. Not only no form—she originally had no qi. Amidst the boundless vastness, it transformed and became qi; qi transformed and became form; form transformed and became life. Now, it has transformed again into death—this is like the passing of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. She lies peacefully in the great chamber, and I wail loudly and follow her in weeping—would this not show I do not understand destiny? Thus, I stopped."

Guo’s note: Before enlightenment, one acts blindly; after enlightenment, one ceases—this is how to instruct the emotional by extending the ultimate principle to dispel burdens.

Lü’s note: What Zhuangzi valued were Confucius, Mengsun Cai, and Yan Hui, yet his conduct resembled that of Zisang, Zifan, and Zi Qinzhang—why?

The corruption of the human Dao has left the world mired in sorrow and joy, extinguishing its inherent heavenly principle—thus the remedy must be as follows.

**Yi Du’s Note:** Zhuangzi dwelt among men and could not forget the human Dao. When his wife died, he drummed on a basin and sang, revealing his emotions through sound. Hui Shi said, "You have lived long and grown old—is this not enough? Yet when she died, you did not weep, showing your lack of feeling. To drum on a basin and sing—is this not excessive?" Zhuangzi replied: When she first died, how could I not grieve? But upon examining her origins—no life, no form, no qi—from what could she truly arise? She dissolved into true emptiness, leaving no trace. Essence congealed into things, giving rise to qi; qi gave rise to form; form gave rise to life. Before the indistinct, there was the beginning of yang; before the uncountable, there was the beginning of yin. Within yin and yang, each contains primordial qi. Qi transforms into form, and with adornment, form transforms into life. With life comes death, and death follows life like a ring without end. Viewed from the perspective of no qi, no form, no life, the myriad things are but true emptiness. Viewed from the perspective of form, qi, and life, there is no constancy—what exists transforms into what does not, just as the four seasons cycle endlessly. She lies peacefully in the great chamber—the great chamber being heaven and earth. The myriad things are like people within a chamber: do people not enter and exit the chamber? Do the myriad things not enter and exit heaven and earth?

**Bi Xu’s Note:** To shudder at the news of death is human nature. To drum on a basin and sing is to use external things to dispel burdens. Humans originally had no life—who then possesses form and qi? Amidst the vast and obscure, things arise from one another, and now they transform and return to nothingness. Is this not like the four seasons succeeding one another without cease? By tracing things to their origin, one ceases worldly concerns.

**Juan Zhai’s Note:** "Form transforms into life" means that form exists before this movement and change. The Buddhists say: "Movement and change belong to the wind"—this is the meaning of "life." The progression of the four seasons is a metaphor for life inevitably leading to death. The act of drumming on a basin is also an allegory, like Yuan Rang climbing a tree and singing—how could one be entirely devoid of human feeling at the death of a parent? The learning of the Confucian school seeks to fulfill filial devotion—how could they not understand the principle of life and death? Yuan Rang, Zhuangzi, and their ilk sought to expose the delusions of the human heart, hence their excessive actions. This is because the Daoist heart is subtle and cannot be practiced in isolation in the world, which is why the teaching of "holding to the mean" exists.

Li Hanlao, mourning his son, asked Da Hui, fearing that his inability to forget emotion was not in accord with the Dao. Da Hui replied: "If one does not weep at the death of a child, one is a jackal or wolf." This response is profoundly insightful. Had other Buddhist practitioners answered this question, they would have fallen into one-sided views. In the chapter on Zhuangzi’s wife’s death, from the perspective of worldly emotions, what is most difficult for people to forget, he handled with perfect equanimity—why? By thoroughly investigating the origins of form and qi, he saw that all arise from nothingness. Amidst the boundless vastness, qi and form emerge, and with form comes consciousness, love, joy, and all attachments. Yet the bonds of kinship and affection are but fleeting illusions. The deluded take them as real, and from attachment arises love, from love arises responsibility, nurturing karmic entanglements that bind life and death, harming the body and damaging the nature—how foolish! The perfected person, pitying the delusions of the common people, employs skillful means to enlighten them: all things in the world arise from being, and being returns to non-being—this is the natural principle. Even metal and stone decay, let alone humans. One must view the world with a discerning eye, allowing no obstruction, like the clear sky and bright sun, eternally luminous. There is no room for sorrow or joy within it. Drumming on a basin and singing is but lending voice to an emotionless thing, a means to correct the excesses of worldly lamentation and weeping. Yet to replace sorrow with joy is still to fall into one-sidedness!

*The Liezi* records: In Wei, there was a man named Shu Menwu whose son died, yet he did not weep. When asked why, he said, "I once had no son, and when I had no son, I was not sorrowful. Now that my son has died, it is the same as when I had no son—why should I grieve?" This is the grand perspective of the enlightened, which sets them apart from the common. Thus, one should not be troubled by the vicissitudes of external things—this is as it should be!

The term *gài* (槩) is likely a miswriting and should be read as *cǎo rán* (叉然), an exclamation of sighing.

*Mángwù* (芒芴) should be read as *huǎnghū* (恍惚).

Zhi Li Shu and Hua Jie Shu were observing the mound of Ming Bo and the wasteland of Kunlun, where the Yellow Emperor once rested. Suddenly, a willow sprouted from Zhi Li Shu’s left elbow, and he was startled and displeased. Zhi Li Shu asked, "Do you dislike this?" Hua Jie Shu replied, "No, why should I dislike it? Life is but a temporary borrowing; what is borrowed to sustain life is but dust and grime. Life and death are like day and night. Moreover, you and I observe transformation, and transformation has reached us—why should I dislike it?"

Guo’s commentary: These passages first present an emotional response, then guide one to the underlying principle to dispel it. If one claims, "I am without emotion, thus without sorrow," then those with emotions would be cut off from the vast and boundless realm, lost in the confines of joy and sorrow.

Lü’s commentary: Where the Yellow Emperor rested, the heart dies and the form decays, like soil unaware of the willow growing from the elbow. The willow is a plant that grows easily. For Hua Jie, the matter initially startled and displeased him, but he ultimately understood that life is but a temporary borrowing of dust and grime—why then should he dislike it? This is the Way of observing transformation as the ancients did.

Yi Du’s commentary: Where the Yellow Emperor rested is the Great Dao. The willow is yin wood; the left is the yang elbow. A willow growing from the left elbow is the transformation of yin and yang. Life is but a temporary borrowing by the Creator, all dust and chaff—why cling to love or aversion? The *Book of Changes* states: "One who understands the Way of day and night knows this principle." Now, observing the transformations of yin and yang and being transformed ourselves—why should we dislike it?

Bi Xu’s commentary: The two men, one named for scattered branches (Zhi Li) and the other for solitary steadfastness (Hua Jie), observed transformation in the empty mound of Ming Bo and the towering wasteland of Kunlun. A willow sprouted from the elbow, taking "left" as the meaning of "life." Life is but a temporary borrowing of transformation’s emptiness; in the discourse of emptiness, life is dust and grime. From the perspective of long shadows, death is the dark of night. Thus, what is born does not truly live, and what transforms does not truly change. Now, what is born is but constant birth, and what suddenly transforms is but constant transformation. Observing constant birth through constant transformation, one knows that constant birth is not real, and constant transformation is not empty. Emptiness and transformation interpenetrate—where is there room for cessation in principle?

Juan Zhai’s commentary: Where the Yellow Emperor rested means he once rested there. The willow refers to a sore; today, we call it a boil. It seems this term existed in ancient times. "Temporary borrowing" is a metaphor for external things as dust and grime, meaning the most minute. This aligns with the Buddhist teaching of the four elements as a temporary combination. Observing the transformations of things and being transformed ourselves means we change along with the Creator. The earlier statement, "startled and displeased," is but human sentiment. Reflecting on the principle of life and death and knowing its origin, the heart of the Dao prevails—why then should one dislike it?

Now, regarding the willow growing from the left elbow—a rather strange expression—most commentaries overlook it, but Lü’s commentary touches upon it. Here, I offer my humble insight and expand upon it: The willow is a plant that grows easily; the left elbow is a seldom-used arm. An unused arm and an easily growing plant symbolize how those without intent or action transform swiftly. The elbow is animate; the willow is inanimate. Animate and inanimate differ in nature and form, yet the animate suddenly transforms into the inanimate—ordinary sentiment cannot help but find this strange. However, things undergo transformation without self-awareness, so all within the great crucible of change are inescapably subject to it. If one awakens to the truth that our life is but a temporary borrowing of dust and grime, then the elbow and the willow are but things—where is there room for attachment or aversion? From this, one knows that the myriad things and I share the same mechanism of transformation, yet without utmost stillness, it cannot be perceived. Thus, Hua Jie Shu observed transformation where the Yellow Emperor rested and was himself transformed. The Yellow Emperor, associated with the virtue of earth, embodies stillness and rest—stillness is the essence of transformation; movement is its function. Observing transformation and being transformed with it means moving in unison with change. Body and transformation as one—where is there anything that is not the self? This speaks of the animate transforming into the inanimate, yet the inanimate may also transform into the animate, as seen in the "Supreme Joy" chapter with the passage on "seeds and vitality." All are transformations wrought by the Creator. Undergoing minor changes while preserving the great constancy, there is nowhere one does not find joy.

Master Chu Boxiu of Wulin’s *Exegesis on "Supreme Joy" (Chapter Two)*

When Zhuangzi journeyed to Chu, he came upon an empty skull, its form intact and robust. Tapping it with his horsewhip, he questioned it, saying: “Did you, Master, covet life and lose the Dao, thus meeting this fate? Or did you suffer the calamities of a fallen state—execution by axe or blade—bringing you to this? Or did you commit some shameful deed, shaming your parents, wife, and children, and so came to this? Or did you endure the miseries of cold and hunger, ending thus? Or did the years of your life simply reach their term?”

Having spoken, he took the skull as his pillow and lay down to sleep. At midnight, the skull appeared in a dream, saying: “Your words resemble those of a sophist. All that you have mentioned are the burdens of the living—none apply in death. Would you hear the truth of death?”

Zhuangzi replied: “Indeed.”

The skull said: “In death, there is no lord above nor minister below; no affairs of the four seasons. At ease, one takes heaven and earth as one’s spring and autumn. Even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass it.”

Zhuangzi, unconvinced, said: “If I bid the Master of Fate restore your form—flesh, bones, and skin—returning you to your parents, wife, children, neighbors, and friends, would you desire it?”

The skull, knitting its brows in dismay, replied: “How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south to return to the toils of the human world?”

**Guo’s Annotation:** Old accounts claim Zhuangzi delighted in death and loathed life. If so, what does it mean to “equalize” them? To equalize is to be at peace in life and at peace in death. Once the emotions of life and death are equalized, one does not grieve over death while living. This is Zhuangzi’s intent.

**Lü’s Annotation:** Tracing beginnings to ends, one understands the discourse on life and death. They are but one body. Thus, those who cling to life and fear death are mistaken, just as those who delight in death and despise life fail to see their unity. Zhuangzi speaks of the joy of a king facing south to address humanity’s greatest affliction—clinging to life and fearing death. Could such words be spoken idly?

**Yi Du’s Annotation:** Zhuangzi uses the skull’s dialogue to equalize life and death, teaching that one should be at peace in life and at peace in death. Thus, neither the transformations of yin and yang nor the vicissitudes of existence can enslave one. One does not grieve over death while living nor cling to life when dying.

**Bixu’s Annotation:** Those who cherish life find joy in worldly affairs; those who hasten toward death see the human world as toil. Only those who transcend life and death can discuss its great fruition.

**Yongzhai’s Note:** “Robust” (*ráorán*) describes emptiness yet firmness. “At ease” (*cóngrán*) conveys unhurried self-possession. “All that you have mentioned” refers to the preceding questions. This passage expounds the principle of life and death through the skull’s discourse—an extraordinary device. Readers should seek its meaning rather than take it literally. Zhuangzi’s five questions to the skull keenly expose the roots of worldly anxieties. The skull’s reply shows that even worldly troubles cannot touch one who has transcended them. Yet many misinterpret this as delighting in death and loathing life—an error! It reveals how people, in their ceaseless striving to cling to life and fear death, lose their original nature. Though their bodies remain, how do they differ from the dead? Thus, this discourse aims to correct such delusions, hoping to awaken even a fraction of understanding—like a skilled physician administering medicine to cure an illness, harming one to benefit the other, as circumstances demand. Knowing life’s limits, one seeks only warmth and sustenance, not hoarding wealth. Knowing death as rest, one surrenders to it without fear or sorrow. In this way, life is free from toil, and death from suffering. At ease, one takes heaven and earth as spring and autumn—where is there not the joy of a king facing south?

**Chen Bixu** titled this chapter *“Two Delusions and Their Refutation”* to dispel the confusion of dualistic views. His analysis is apt.

When Yan Yuan was sent to Qi, Confucius wore a troubled expression. Zigong rose from his mat and asked: “May I dare ask why, when Yan Yuan was sent to Qi, you bore a troubled look?”

Confucius replied: “Excellent question! Long ago, Guanzi spoke words I deeply admired: ‘A small sack cannot hold a large object; a short rope cannot draw from a deep well.’ Such is the way of things—destiny has its limits, and form its constraints. They cannot be altered. I fear Yan Yuan may speak to the Marquis of Qi of the Ways of Yao, Shun, and the Yellow Emperor, and further cite the words of Suiren and Shennong. If the marquis seeks within himself and finds nothing, he will be perplexed. Perplexity leads to ruin.

“Have you not heard this tale? Once, a seabird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Marquis of Lu escorted it to the ancestral temple, offered it wine, performed the *Nine Shao* as music, and prepared an ox, sheep, and pig as a feast. Yet the bird, dazed and sorrowful, dared not eat a morsel nor drink a cup. Three days later, it died. This was nourishing the bird as one nourishes oneself, not as a bird nourishes a bird. To nourish a bird as a bird would, one should let it perch in deep forests, roam open plains, float on rivers and lakes, feed on fish and shrimp, follow its flock in flight, and rest at ease. Birds dislike the sound of human voices—why subject it to such clamor? If the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* were played in the wilds of Dongting, birds would flee at the sound, beasts would scatter, and fish would dive deep. Yet humans, hearing it, would gather to listen. Fish live in water and thrive; humans live in water and drown. Their natures differ, and so do their likes and dislikes. Thus, the sages did not impose a single standard of ability nor demand uniform tasks. Names were confined to reality, and duties adapted to suitability—this is called ‘orderly conduct and sustained good fortune.’”

**Guo’s Annotation:** If one seeks within and finds nothing, then seeks without, combining inner and outer—how is this not perplexity?

Names confined to reality, thus no name exceeds its substance. Duties adapted to suitability, thus no duty exceeds its proper application. Orderly conduct follows the length of each branch without seeking uniformity—seeking uniformity, one fails to attain it. Sustained good fortune accords with the measure of each portion without overreaching—overreaching, one fails to preserve it.

**Lü’s Annotation:** To know the realm of not-knowing right and wrong, yet hear the words of Zhuangzi, is to invite dizziness, sorrow, and grief—hence the repeated reference to the sea bird, urging scholars to ponder deeply and act with caution. The difference between a walled city and a cave, the skill of catching mice a thousand *li* away, the nature of seeing in darkness and blindness in daylight—these are why the sages did not impose a single standard of ability nor demand uniform tasks.

**Dú’s Annotation:** When Yan Hui went to Qi, he wished to teach the Marquis of Qi with the Way of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, unaware that the Marquis’s nature was fixed. To force instruction would bring humiliation—hence Confucius’s sorrow and Zigong’s inquiry. A coarse sack cannot hold gold; a well-rope cannot draw from the deep. One must discern the Mandate of Heaven, which cannot be altered or augmented—only followed as it is. If one seeks within and finds nothing, then seeks without, confusion arises in the heart. Though one may wish to preserve life, how can it be achieved? The ancients who died for forthright remonstrance did so for this reason. Like offering *Nine Shao* music and a grand ox sacrifice to a sea bird in the temple, they failed to recognize the difference in likes and dislikes.

Thus the sage accords with the nature of the myriad things, not imposing a single standard of ability—each thing fulfills its own capacity. Not demanding uniform tasks, the sage remains nameless, for names arise only from reality. The sage remains without fixed duty, for duties arise only from adapting to change. Names confined to reality avoid empty titles; duties adapted to suitability avoid improper conduct. Orderly conduct meets no obstruction; sustained good fortune brings contentment in every circumstance.

**Bìxū’s Annotation:** The Mandate received is natural—it cannot be urged to completion, just as a small sack cannot contain what is great. The endowment of one’s nature is fixed—it cannot be altered, just as a short rope cannot draw from the deep. The sea bird’s alarm at *Nine Shao* is like the Marquis of Qi’s confusion at the sovereign’s Way. People differ in worthiness and folly, so none can be made uniform. Affairs differ in antiquity and present, so none can be made identical.

Names and reality do not overstep—thus there is order without obstruction. Principles and their application suit their purpose—thus misfortune departs and danger does not arise.

**Yongzhai’s Note:** Mandate and form are received from Heaven, each with its fixed allotment, which cannot be diminished or augmented. Speaking to the Marquis of Qi of the Way of the ancients failed to move or transform him, and this might even incur blame—here, borrowing Yanzi’s example to satirize the wandering persuaders of the age, who, like those who feed men’s food to seabirds, lose their true nature.

This meaning is simply that one should not speak to those unfit to hear, and to speak to them is to speak amiss. Zhuangzi expands upon this with a passage of his own.

*Tan* is read as *chan*, a sandbar in water.

People’s talents differ, and their affairs vary; names are attained according to what truly exists, and principles are attained according to what suits their intent. "Orderly" means direct and effortless. "Sustained good fortune" means fortune is constantly preserved.

A small sack cannot contain what is great—this illustrates that the Mandate has its fulfillment and cannot be altered. A short rope cannot draw from the deep—this illustrates that one’s form has its proper bounds and cannot be forced. All these are bestowed by the Creator, and nothing can be added or taken away in the process.

Now, to speak to the Marquis of Qi of the Way of the former kings would fail to align with his inherent disposition, leaving him confused and without guidance, and thus harming his very form. Hence the subsequent analogy of the seabird: offered the finest meats, it dares not partake; hearing the *Shao* music, it grows only more sorrowful. This is like nourishing seabirds with what nourishes men, losing what is fitting for them.

*Yuqi* refers to dung and filth. The *wuzu* grass grows by the water’s edge; commonly called "ink-black crow’s whiskers," its leaves and roots differ in kind though it is one plant—this arises from the interplay of yin and yang.

Indeed, things that arise together cannot be judged by a single nest. The butterfly, drawn to warmth, transforms into the *qurang*; when newly emerged, its form is pure as if freshly shed. After a thousand days, it can fly, and its foam becomes the *simī* insect—this speaks of transformations between small and great, endlessly interlinked.

The *simī* feeds on *po* (fermented grain), and below this, it is shown how sentient beings change through contact with their kind. *Guran* is the *lan* grass. The *fuxuan* is the firefly—here, the insentient becomes sentient, like rotting wheat transforming into a butterfly.

The *fuxuan* gives rise to the *yangxi* (sheep’s-hoof vegetable), where the sentient returns to the insentient. The *yangxi* joins with old bamboo that bears no shoots, and from these two insentient things comes the *qingning*, resembling a hedgehog—commonly called "rotted bamboo," for gardens often have hedgehogs.

The *Shizi* states: The people of Yue call the leopard *cheng*, or some say *cheng* means *mo* (pattern). The *Soushen Ji* records that in the time of Duke Xiao of Qin, a horse gave birth to a human—such are the transformations wrought by the Five Movements and Six Qi upon things, beyond the reach of political discourse.

**Yongzhai’s Note:** To live is to eat and drink—this is called nourishment; to die is to become still and vanish—this is called joy. Yet here it is reversed—this is the playful twist.

As for "the seeds of things," it speaks of how the beings of the world arise from different seeds. Taking the most minute as an example, the greatest are no different in this regard. The marvel of the text lies in its irregularity within regularity, like watching clouds shape a galloping horse—ever more wondrous the longer one looks.

*Dang* is the moss that first appears upon the water, not yet fully formed. The "clothing of the *wāpín*" is the moss that has already formed, clinging to the earth and adhering to the shore.

The *língtún* are the high places in fields and wilds. The *língwū* is plantain. The *yùqī* is dung and soil. The roots of *wūzú* become *qícáo*, while its leaves are another name for butterflies.

Below this, the text speaks of insects born through transformation—from *qūráng* and *gānyúgǔ* to *xiāngyīn* and *fǔquán*—all names of insects, signifying the endless transformations and ceaseless generation of the myriad things. Yet in the end, it ties together the most monstrous of these, startling the world and shocking the common mind.

*Yángxī* is the name of a grass. The grass resembling bamboo but not sprouting recklessly is called *bùgǒu jiǔzhú*. *Qīngníng* is an insect. *Chéng* is also an insect. *Mǎ* is also a grass, like *mǎchǐ* or *mǎlán*. *Rén* is also a grass, like *rénshēn* or *rénmiànzǐ*. Though it clearly employs many names of grasses, it deliberately uses *mǎ* ("horse") and *rén* ("human") as bizarre and uncanny terms. Previous commentators have all deemed this obscure, showing how countless generations have been deceived without seeing through it.

The transformations of the myriad things—such as sparrows turning into clams, hawks into turtledoves, rotting grass into fireflies, and rats into bats—are without limit! "Emerging from the mechanism and entering the mechanism" is none other than "birth and death," like fire passed on endlessly without exhaustion.

This chapter, from "the seeds of things" to "horses giving birth to humans," is detailed in the *Liezi*, though *Nanhua* (Zhuangzi) cites it with some abridgment. The principles of growth and transformation in plants and animals cannot all be witnessed by the eyes and ears; only a scholar of *gewu* (investigation of things) can fully comprehend them. Here, the text thoroughly discusses the inconstancy of transformations in living kinds to illustrate that the cycles of life, death, coming, and going in the human world are nothing strange—one need only recognize that there is an unchanging essence that endures.

Examining the classical text, though not all is fully understood, we may infer its meaning from the context: the passage should be punctuated after the two *pò* characters, then *jiǔyóu fǔquán*, followed by *yángxī* to *qīngníng* as a single phrase. The *Chéng Fǎshī Commentary* instead groups *jīxiá huángwèi xiāngrǎn jiǔzhú*, which likely misconstrues the original intent. Chén Bìxū’s edition, collated by Zhāng Jūnfáng, reads: *Sīmí* feeds on *pò*, *pò* gives rise to *yíxiá*, *yíxiá* to *huángwèi*, *huángwèi* to *jiǔyóu*, *jiǔyóu* to *gǔrǎn*, *xiāngrǎn* to *fǔquán*, *fǔquán* to *yángxī*, *yángxī* compared to *bùcǎo*, and *jiǔzhú* gives birth to *qīngníng*, and so on. This version arranges the phrases neatly but adds excessive elaboration, lacking the stylistic variation characteristic of *Nanhua*’s prose.

Further investigation of the *Liezi* commentary cites the *Erya*: "When bears and tigers mate, their offspring are leopards." The *Shanhaijing* states: "Southern mountains abound in *mó* leopards." Guo Pu’s note explains: "The white leopard is called *mó*; *chéng* is another name for *mó*, and *mó* is another name for leopards."

This chapter is titled "Utmost Joy," yet it begins by discussing how having life is a burden, filled with myriad worries and sorrows, leading to avoidance, pursuit, and indecision—no one knows how to truly preserve the body. Why is this? The intent is that if one can, amid suffering, generate revulsion and resolutely seek liberation, then joy will arrive.

Thus, what the world calls joy may not truly be joy. For all things under heaven flourish and then decline, reach an extreme and then transform. The solitary minister and the disgraced son—how perilous their thoughts, how anxious their reflections, how isolated their plight—yet they attain understanding. From this, we know that poverty, low status, sorrow, and grief may forge one into a "jade maiden," for the mechanisms of fortune and misfortune are ever intertwined. Thus, the whole world is trapped in the realm of sorrow and joy, unable to escape—how can they rest in the true nature of their lives?

Therefore, in the end, the absence of joy and praise is the highest praise and utmost joy. The subsequent accounts of singing while striking a basin and the skull’s reply both take what others find joyless as one’s own joy—how could such joy be shared with the vulgar world? Zhōng Shū observed transformation and was himself transformed, his elbow changing without aversion; one who seeks himself and fails, hearing music, is startled into sorrow. This shows that following transformation brings shared joy, while resisting one’s nature—even with nurture—is no true joy.

Finally, it discusses the inconstancy of transformations in plants, insects, and beasts, concluding: "All emerge from the mechanism, all enter the mechanism—how vast the mechanism! Who can relax or tighten it?" All things within form and vessels arise from this. The cycles of life, death, and transformation are endless. To delight in life and abhor death, or to rejoice in death and weary of life, is to cling to one side and miss the utmost joy. Only when there is neither joy nor non-joy, neither life nor non-life, does one cease to be enslaved by transformation or moved by the mechanism, attaining the wondrous subtlety of the *Great Expansion*—empty, unified, and non-active—profound and serene as if present. This is the utmost joy!

**Attaining Life (I)**

One who attains the essence of life does not pursue what life cannot achieve; one who attains the essence of destiny does not strive after what knowledge cannot alter. To nourish the form, one must first rely on things—yet there are cases where things are abundant yet the form remains unnourished. To possess life, one must first not depart from form—yet there are cases where form does not depart yet life perishes.

Life’s coming cannot be refused; its going cannot be halted. Alas! The people of the world believe that nourishing the form suffices to preserve life. Yet if nourishing the form truly does not suffice to preserve life, then what in the world is worth doing? Though it may not suffice, one cannot but do it—such effort is inescapable.

To escape the toil of serving the form, nothing surpasses abandoning the world. Abandoning the world means freedom from entanglements; freedom from entanglements means perfect equilibrium; perfect equilibrium means renewing life with that which is other, and in renewal lies nearness to the Dao. What need is there to abandon affairs? What need is there to forsake life? Abandoning affairs spares the form from labor; forsaking life preserves the essence from depletion. When form is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven.

Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things: when united, they form bodies; when dispersed, they become beginnings. When form and essence remain unharmed, this is called *transformation*; when essence is refined to the utmost, it returns to assist Heaven.

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
What life cannot achieve lies beyond one’s allotted portion; what knowledge cannot alter lies beyond the bounds of destiny. Knowing when to halt at one’s portion and letting things accord with their nature—this is sufficient. Excess brings harm. Clinging too tightly to form leads to the loss of life. Knowing that one cannot control what is not one’s own, and refraining from attachment to such concerns, one may nourish life all the more, yet the approach of death draws ever nearer. If, instead, one lets things follow their course, allowing each to fulfill its nature, all arises within the supreme principle—inescapably so. *Renewal* means daily newness; entrusting oneself to daily newness, one exhausts the limits of life and destiny. Thus, to abandon and forsake is to avoid partiality in action, enabling one to be a child to the myriad things, achieving completion wherever one is and moving in harmony with transformation, thereby aiding the natural course.

**Lǚ Huìqīng’s Commentary:**
What life cannot achieve is that which does not sustain life. What knowledge cannot alter is what lies beyond knowing. Generally, forms remain unnourished not because of insufficiency in things, but due to excessive attachment to life. Generally, life perishes not because form departs from life, but because one’s actions lead to death. From this, we know that nourishing the form does not suffice to preserve life—then what in the world is worth doing? Yet one cannot but do it, for how can one escape serving the form? To escape serving the form, one must be in the world without entanglement; without entanglement, one attains perfect equilibrium; perfect equilibrium means not treating form as a burden or affairs as tasks, and thus renewing life with that which is other. In attaining this renewal, one nears the essence of existence.

Affairs are not inherently worth abandoning, but failing to abandon them entangles one in affairs and wearies the form. Life is not inherently worth forsaking, but failing to forsake it enslaves one to life and depletes the essence. When form is whole and essence restored, virtue returns to its origin. The myriad things receive essence from Heaven and take form from Earth: their union constitutes the formation of bodies. The harmonious blending of Heaven and Earth gives rise to the transformation of the myriad things. Their dispersal marks the beginning of things, as when male and female unite in essence to generate life. When united, they remain unharmed; when dispersed, they enable transformation. Remaining unharmed preserves essence; enabling transformation refines it further. By returning what one has received from Heaven to assist Heaven, how wondrous is the preservation of life!

**Lín Yídú’s Commentary:**
What life cannot achieve refers to the misfortune of seeking excess in life. What knowledge cannot alter refers to the inevitability of poverty, wealth, long life, or early death. Nourishing the form depends on things, yet endless pursuit of things burdens the form. Life depends on form, yet clinging to form without departure may still lead to the loss of life—meaning the form remains, but the principle of life has perished. Life’s coming cannot be refused; its going cannot be halted. People believe that nourishing the form suffices to preserve life, yet if it truly does not suffice, then what in the world is worth doing? Though it may not suffice, one cannot but do it. To escape serving the form, nothing surpasses abandoning the world. The world consists of others who share life with me and cannot be left behind. The great awakened see this as a vast dream. Once the great is gone, what thing can entangle? Without entanglement, the mind is in perfect equilibrium, enabling renewal with that which is other. Endless renewal leads to destiny. What need is there to abandon affairs or forsake life? Yet at the outset, one cannot but abandon and forsake, so that the form is not wearied and the essence is not depleted. Thus, one becomes one with Heaven and a companion to transformation. When Heaven and Earth unite, the myriad things are born; bodies take form, beginnings take qi. Union constitutes being; dispersal constitutes non-being. When form is whole, clarity arises; when essence is whole, spirit arises. Essence refined to the utmost becomes the supreme spirit of the world, enabling one to assist the Heaven of all things with one’s own Heaven.

**Chén Bìxū’s Commentary:**
One who attains the essence of life accepts wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness, knowing that wealth is not gained by forced pursuit, nor nobility by vain longing. One who attains the essence of destiny accepts wisdom or folly, success or failure, knowing that wisdom is not attained by fragmented learning, nor success by forced effort. Gold and jade may adorn a house, but frugality in desires is unused; when spirit and qi are vigorous yet one pursues things to the point of ruin, this is ever the case. Alas! The inverted views of the world—only those who disregard the self can avoid the realm of death. The principle is inherent, though it may not suffice, yet it is inescapable for the living. The greatest respite from serving the form lies in worldly entanglements; forgetting entanglements means freedom from burden, and freedom from burden means no peril, with virtue and achievement renewed daily. Renewing life with that which is other, one nears the Dao.

In the world, no affair stands without action; no body exists without life. Then what need is there to abandon affairs or forsake life? Yet when form is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with creation. Union forms the bodies of things; dispersal returns to the primordial void. Those who truly attain life forget form, and thus form remains whole; they forget life, and thus essence is restored.

When form and essence are robust, they move with the transformations of creation, refining the subtle without cease, returning only to assist their natural course.

Liu Li notes: Life is what I possess; destiny is what Heaven ordains. Those who fully grasp life can thereby know Heaven; those who fully grasp destiny have never forgotten humanity. What life cannot be made to do, one simply does not do—thus all that can be ceased is ceased. What knowledge cannot alter, one accepts—thus all that can be accepted requires no seeking from without. Neither seeking nor acting, one merges with the Dao.

Yet when man takes form in the world, the world’s entanglements are ever entwined, never parted. Moreover, form is not the Dao, the world is not the self—entanglement lies only in things. Viewed by principle, among these three, entanglements are easily cast off. If entanglements can be shed, what does the world mean to me? If the world can be relinquished, what is there to envy in form? Neither bound to the world nor coveting form—this is the utmost in grasping life and destiny.

Lin’s *Yongzhai Discourse on Righteousness* states: What life cannot be made to do refers to things beyond the body. What knowledge cannot alter refers to what lies beyond human power. Nurturing form requires things; having life necessitates preserving form. Yet things are often in excess while form cannot endure forever; though form may be preserved, life is finite. Though insufficient, it cannot be neglected—this echoes the earlier saying that nothing is sufficient to rely upon, yet nothing can be neglected. Whether acting or not acting, one cannot escape self-entanglement. To escape entanglement, one must abandon the world. Abandoning the world is not fleeing it. Dwelling in the world without attachment, responding only when moved, acting only when compelled—then the self remains the self, and the world remains the world. True equilibrium means the heart knows no high or low, no choice. Renewal brings endless transformation. Moving with creation, daily renewed, then matters beyond the body and the life one possesses fade of themselves without need for abandonment.

The four great elements combine to form the body; when dispersed, they return to their origin in nothingness. When form and essence are whole, one can transform—this is called the power to shift. At this stage of embodying the Dao, essence becomes ever more refined, capable of aiding creation.

Chu’s *Insights* observes: Xu You retreated to the mountains and declined the throne, knowing what life cannot be made to do. Confucius, besieged in Chen, played the zither and sang, knowing what knowledge cannot alter. If one does not accept life as it is but seeks to augment it, things will be in excess while form remains unnurtured. If one does not accept knowledge as it is but exhausts it, form will not depart, yet life will perish. Life’s coming cannot be refused—one must nurture it well to sustain it. Its going cannot be halted—over-nurturing harms it. The world’s people believe nurturing form suffices to preserve life, knowing only nurturing as nurturing. Yet nurturing form does not suffice to preserve life, for they do not understand the true nature of nurturing, and their nurturing is not true nurturing. Life is insufficient to rely upon, for it perishes through nurturing. Yet there is that which cannot be neglected—hunger must be fed, thirst must be quenched—such acts cannot be avoided, for the world still exists. Thus, to avoid serving form, nothing surpasses abandoning the world. With the world present, to relinquish it—what entanglement remains?

True equilibrium means regarding all things as one, differing from the world’s way of life—hence it is called renewal. Renewal brings one near the Dao. Affairs are not to be abandoned—one can transform things. Life is not to be relinquished—one can forget it. Yet when form is whole and essence restored, this arises from abandoning affairs and relinquishing life, progressing from the coarse to the refined. Unity with Heaven—is this not the ultimate attainment?

All things in the world are born of Heaven and Earth’s qi. When conjoined, they become the bodies of the myriad things, emerging into being. When dispersed, they return to the beginning of Heaven and Earth, reverting to nothingness. When form is whole and essence restored, one can penetrate transformation—thus moving through Heaven as Heaven, through Earth as Earth, among men as a man, encountering things as a thing. Refining essence ever further

Do not open the Heaven of man, but open the Heaven of Heaven. Opening the Heaven of Heaven gives birth to virtue; opening the Heaven of man gives birth to harm. Not rejecting one’s Heaven, not neglecting man—thus the people nearly preserve their true nature.

Guo’s commentary: The heart is empty, thus it can govern the full. Utmost harmony—nothing is impossible, yet it is not things that come to be so. How can things be distant from one another? Only the heartless are truly distant. Though all are beings of form and color, this is not enough to surpass one another. Ever roaming the ultimate—this is not controlled by things. Abiding by the portion one has received, obscurely renewing with creation day by day, beginning and end are the limits of things. Adornment makes them two.

Do not use the heart to command qi, do not use things to sever one’s nature. All things arise of themselves. Like the drunkard who falls from the cart—he loses what he knows, yet this is not the absence of natural no-mind. Ganjiang and Moye serve as weapons, yet those who repay Moye do not seek to break them. A falling tile, though it strikes a man, is not resented—all because it is without mind.

To know without forethought is to open Heaven; to be moved only after knowing is to open man. Opening Heaven is the movement of nature; opening man is the function of knowledge. When nature moves, encountering things, one is content and forgets the rest—this is the birth of virtue. When knowledge functions, one follows stimuli and seeks without ceasing—this is the birth of harm. Acting by the nature of Heaven, human principles remain whole. The afflictions of the people and the rise of artifice always lie in the function of knowledge, not in the movement of nature.

Lü’s commentary: The movements of Heaven and Earth, the transformations of the myriad things—what are they if not qi? If one can truly guard the pure qi, then there is no blockage, no heat, no danger—nothing strange in this. It is simply the utmost emptiness. How could cleverness, boldness, or daring compare?

Consider the dragon: when its parts unite to form a body, it ascends to the heights and coils in the depths, reaching everywhere. When it scatters to form patterns, it enters the realm of nothingness and cannot be seen—all through qi alone. All that have appearance, image, sound, or color are things. How can things be distant from one another? What is there to reach the fore? They are all merely form. The fore belongs to the time before things existed; form belongs to the time after things have come to be. How could these reach the guarding of pure qi or the roaming of utmost emptiness?

When things arise from the formless, they are without appearance, image, sound, or color. Thus they abide where there is nothing they do not transform, yet nothing they depart from. Those who attain this and exhaust its depths will dwell within the measure of no excess—neither entangled nor obscured, fitting perfectly without overreaching. Hidden within the traceless thread, beginning and end turn back upon themselves, beyond exhaustion.

Roaming the beginning and end of the myriad things—this is what is meant by arising from the formless and abiding where there is nothing they do not transform. Unify nature, and there is no duality. Nurture qi, and it is not depleted. Harmonize one’s virtue to penetrate what things arise from—then nature is cultivated, virtue is returned to, and one joins the Creator in the formless.

Thus, guarding wholeness without retreat—how could things enter? Those whole in wine—death, life, and terror do not enter their breasts. Then those who hide in Heaven and preserve wholeness—how could things harm them? When there is always one who wields killing, encounters with men are like meeting Ganjiang or a falling tile. This is why the world is balanced and even. Though states are overthrown, there is no chaos of war.

Opening Heaven gives birth to virtue, for one forgets both knowing and acting. Opening man gives birth to harm, for virtue has a heart and the heart has eyes. Not rejecting one’s Heaven is to open it; not neglecting man is to fear what man fears. If the people know this, they nearly preserve their true nature.

Yidu’s commentary: Purity is without mixture; guarding is attaining unity. Without mixture, there is stillness; attaining unity, there is focus. Qi is still and has guard—this is what is meant by "focusing qi to attain softness." How could this belong to the realm of cleverness, boldness, or daring?

Appearance, image, sound, and color—how can things be distant from one another? Yet what the world values does not tread the countenance of spirit and illumination, but only precedes with the colors of joy and anger. How can this surpass things? All that things arise from have form only after the formless, transformation only after the untransformed. The virtue of spirit and illumination—movement and stillness both abide within it. Attaining this and exhausting its wondrous principle, reaching the formless and untransformed—how could things limit it?

Rites and measures have laws, thus they do not exceed; the thread of the Dao has a root, thus it is traceless. Only without beginning and end can one begin and end the myriad things. Thus, unify nature and there is no duality; nurture qi and there is no harm; harmonize virtue and there is no dispersion. If so, one penetrates what things arise from without contention, guards one’s nature without loss. How could things from without enter?

Below, three analogies are again set forth: the drunkard who falls from the cart is whole in wine and cannot be harmed; the blade and the falling tile, being without mind, are not resented. The Heaven of man is the natural within activity; the Heaven of Heaven is the natural within non-activity. Laozi said: "Earth follows Heaven—this is the Heaven of man. The Dao follows the natural—this is the Heaven of Heaven."

Virtue is born when one does not govern the state with knowledge; harm is born when one governs the state with knowledge. Not rejecting man is not to extinguish Heaven with man; not neglecting man is not to abandon man for Heaven. The people nearly preserve their true nature—this speaks of their transformation below, and nothing more.

Bixu’s commentary: Through their subtle conduct, they can obscurely penetrate. Not encountering tigers or rhinos, not avoiding armor and weapons—this is holding to purity without mixture, the heart without cunning. All things are form and color—who is first and who is last?

Shape gives rise to transformation; attaining this Dao of formlessness and non-transformation, thus there is no exhaustion, and all things rectify themselves! That which is called "moving in concealment without obstruction" does not transgress the laws and measures, contains brilliance and conceals radiance, roams through the beginning and end of the myriad things, and returns to the Great Void—nothing more! Unifying essence, nurturing qi, and harmonizing virtue—these three become one, merging with transformation itself!

Its Heavenly endowment remains whole, its spirit unobstructed; what place is there for blockage, heat, fear, or trembling to enter? The drunken man whom no thing can harm is likewise such. The sage embodies Heavenly principle, and even ghosts and spirits cannot perceive his traces. To possess mind and emotion is to invite injury and resentment.

Thus, applying this to cultivate the self yields harmony and smoothness; applying it to govern the state yields great peace. Not employing knowledge to enslave knowledge, but forgetting to dispel forgetting—those who forget scheming attain virtue; those who enslave knowledge invite harm. Neither complacent in possessing virtue nor deeming ignorance a loss, one approaches the true Dao.

Yongzhai says: The guarding of pure qi is the guarding of original qi without admixture. Appearance, image, sound, and color are called "having form and description." All things are constrained by form; if I leave traces, I am the same as them—how then can I reach what preceded the existence of things? That people cannot perceive the beginning and end of the myriad things is because they are burdened by traces—nothing more than form. The earlier four characters ("appearance, image, sound, color") are later condensed to the single word "form"—this is a matter of literary method.

The Creator has no form and rests in non-transformation, speaking of its unchanging nature. Attaining this principle of creation and exhausting its subtleties, one distances oneself far from the realm of existing things! Thus, how could one be confined? The measure of non-excess, the constant law, the beginningless norm, the inexhaustible principle, the beginning and end of the myriad things—this is creation. Unifying essence and harmonizing virtue, one becomes one with the Creator, hence it is said: "penetrating what things create."

Called Heaven, called spirit—this principle within me, once internally whole and unobstructed, what business have external things entering? The analogy of the drunken man falling from a cart, crushed by beams, or struck by tiles is most precise and reasonable. The Heaven of man still possesses mind; the Heaven of Heaven is without mind.

The Heaven of Heaven unfolds through the virtue of spontaneity; the Heaven of man unfolds while the heart-mind remains untransformed—thus the six senses all become thieves, let alone external things! Liezi grasped the Way of wind-transmission, hence his inquiry took this form. The answer, in a single phrase, lay in the preservation of pure qi. For whether man or beast, plant or tree, emptiness or metal or stone—whether endowed with consciousness or not—none depart from qi. Man receives the purity of qi; the adept preserves this pure qi and embraces spirit in stillness, so that in movement, no thing can obstruct him, no fire can burn him, no peril can make him tremble.

Form and image, sound and color—things do not differ widely, so how could any precede another? All are but manifestations of form and color. Yet what precedes them is the formless, which is the very source of form; what remains untransformed is the very source of transformation. Thus the beginning and end of the myriad things become visible! Exhausting this principle, how could things ever constrain one? Therefore, abiding within the bounds of one’s allotted portion, concealing oneself within the ever-renewing norm, and roaming to the utmost limit of things—unifying essence and nurturing qi, merging virtue with Heaven, and penetrating what things create—one transcends beyond the realm of form and color!

The body may be forgotten, the spirit need not be questioned—what business have external things entering one’s dwelling? Next, the discussion turns to the drunken man, preserved whole by wine, and the sage, concealed within Heaven, so that nothing can harm them. The analogy of beams and falling tiles illustrates the state of no-mind and no-emotion: though they strike a person, no resentment arises—how much less if they do not strike? If man could be thus, the world would be level and equal, and whence would come war and slaughter?

Thus, the Heavenly nature of man depends on what unfolds, and therein virtue and thievery diverge. Let the scholar be ever vigilant.

Should things seek to restrain it? The word "restrain" (止) is ill-fitting here. Guo’s commentary notes: "The ultimate cannot be controlled"—it should be "control" (制), a near-homophone corrupted in transmission.

Confucius, traveling to Chu, emerged into a forest and saw an old man catching cicadas with a sticky pole, as effortlessly as plucking them. Confucius said: "How skillful you are! Is there a Dao to this?" The man replied: "I have my Dao. After five or six months of stacking pellets—two without falling—the misses are few; three without falling, and only one in ten is lost; five without falling, and it is as if I pluck them. My stance is as rooted as a withered stump; my arm, as steady as a dead branch. Though heaven and earth are vast and the ten thousand things myriad, I know only the cicada’s wings. I do not waver, nor turn aside, nor let the ten thousand things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I not succeed?"

Confucius turned to his disciples and said: "When the will is undivided, it congeals into spirit." Is this not what the cicada-catching elder embodies?

Guo’s commentary: Stacking two pellets on the pole’s tip tests the steadiness of the hand—thus the misses are minimal. With three pellets unfallen, misses grow fewer still; with five unfallen, steadiness reaches its peak, and nothing is lost, for in abandoning all else, this is attained.

Lü’s commentary: To grasp the Dao of catching cicadas is to embody the guarding of pure qi—its undivided focus is no different.

Yi Du’s note: *Jun chang* refers to a bent waist. Catching cicadas as if gathering them, Confucius, struck by the man’s skill, suspected a Dao and questioned him. The reply: during the fifth and sixth months, when cicadas sing, stacking pellets precariously—even the most practiced can keep them from falling. This is the method of cicada-catching. *Zizhu* denotes the smallest measure, the beginning of numbers. "As if plucking them" marks the transition from unity to nothingness. "Withered stump" and "dead branch" describe his immobility. "Not letting the ten thousand things distract from the cicada’s wings—how could I not succeed?" Yet this is hardly innate! When the will is undivided, it congeals into spirit.

Bi Xu’s commentary: Cicadas can be used for brewing, hence their capture. Initially, one practices by stacking pellets on the pole’s tip to test the steadiness of the hand. With two stacks unfallen, the misses are minimal; with five unfallen, the body becomes like severed wood, the arm like a withered branch, and cicadas alight without hesitation—thus they are taken as if plucked. From this, we know that with singular focus and congealed spirit, the Dao is never unattainable—how much more so for catching cicada wings!

Yong Qi’s note: "Not wavering, not turning aside" means simply fixing the mind, focusing solely on the cicada without distraction. This analogy illustrates the guarding of pure qi, though in the world, such skill is treated as mere technique, unaware of the Dao embedded within.

"Congeals into spirit" (*ning yu shen*)—*ning* should be *yi* (doubt), as seen in the later "Refining" chapter.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: "I once crossed the deep rapids of Shang, where the ferryman handled the boat as if by spirit. I asked him: 'Can boat-handling be learned?' He said: 'It can. Those skilled in swimming often master it. As for divers, they have never seen a boat yet handle it effortlessly.' I questioned him further, but he would not explain. May I ask what this means?"

Confucius said: "Those skilled in swimming often master it because they forget the water. As for divers who have never seen a boat yet handle it effortlessly—they see the depths as hills, the capsizing of a boat as a cart’s retreat. Though a thousand overturnings and reversals lie before them, none enter their dwelling—where could they not find leisure?

"One who stakes tiles gambles with skill; one who stakes hooks hesitates; one who stakes gold is confounded. The skill is the same, yet where there is pride, the external is weighted. All who weight the external are clumsy within."

Guo’s commentary: Though things have their nature, practice is required to master them. Through practice, nature is perfected, appearing as if innate. Seeing depths as hills, they view a boat’s capsizing in the abyss as a cart’s retreat on a slope. Though overturnings and reversals abound, they do not trouble the heart, for their nature is at ease, and all encounters are met with leisure. The heavier the stake, the more the mind clings—those who wish to nurture life and preserve the inner must be without pride or weight.

Lü’s commentary: Observing the boatman and the gold-staking examples, one who preserves form and restores essence must abandon the world and relinquish life to the point of spirit without retreat—only then can this be achieved.

Yi Du’s note: This parable of attaining life speaks of following nature and acting with sincerity, the heart unburdened by attachments—wherever one goes, self-possession abounds. The skilled swimmer, following nature to handle a boat, is not yet perfected; the diver, however, has never seen a boat yet handles it effortlessly. Though overturnings and reversals lie before them, none enter their breast—where could they not find leisure?

"Staking" refers to gambling with objects in archery. A hook is more valuable than a tile, gold more valuable than a hook. With nothing prized, skill remains; with something prized, the mind is thrown into chaos.

Bi Xu’s commentary: Handling a boat as if by spirit, the skilled swimmer fears no drowning. The diver, submerged in water, does not wait for a boat but handles it effortlessly—those who forget water still rely on boats; those who have never seen a boat forget both. Anxiety and rest do not enter the breast, for the inner is abundant and at ease. This illustrates how, with a cheap vessel like a tile, one’s aim is precise; with a valuable hook or gold, one’s aim falters. Thus, lightening the water allows one to handle a boat; weighting the prize makes the mind clumsy. This is the principle of nature.

Yong Zhai’s note: The skilled diver sees water as level ground and thus, without learning, can handle a boat. "Staking" refers to gambling with objects in archery. The archer’s skill is fundamentally the same, yet where there is attachment, what is prized lies without, and the inner is deluded.

Delusion turns even the skilled clumsy at times!

Tian Kaizhi visited Duke Wei of Zhou. The Duke said: "I have heard that Zhu Shen is a student of the Dao. You have traveled with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?"

Tian Kaizhi replied: "Kaizhi holds but a broom and dustpan to attend at the gate—what could I have learned from the Master!"

The Duke said: "Do not decline, Master Tian. I wish to hear it."

Kaizhi said: "I heard the Master say: 'One who nurtures life well is like a shepherd—he watches those lagging behind and whips them.'"

The Duke asked: "What does this mean?"

Tian Kaizhi said: "In Lu there was a man named Shan Bao who lived in the cliffs and drank from streams. He did not compete with others for profit. At seventy, his complexion was still that of a child. Yet misfortune struck when he encountered a starving tiger, which killed and devoured him.

There was also a man named Zhang Yi who frequented the gates of the high and mighty, running wherever he was called. At forty, he died of internal heat.

Bao nurtured his inner self, but the tiger consumed his outer; Yi nurtured his outer self, but illness attacked his inner. Both failed to whip those lagging behind.

Confucius said: 'Do not enter and hide; do not exit and expose; stand like dry wood in the center.' If one attains these three, one’s name will surely reach its peak.

Those who fear the roads—where ten travelers are killed by one—warn their fathers, sons, and brothers. They must gather a large escort before daring to venture out. How wise they are!

Yet what people truly fear lies only on their mats and in their meals. They do not know that the real danger comes from excess.

Guo’s note: The student of the Dao seeks harmony within. Clinging to one method to the point of excess falls short of the harmony of universal adaptation. 'Whipping the laggards' means correcting what is lacking.

To hide is already internal, yet to enter further is excessive entry. To expose is already external, yet to exit further is excessive exit. Like withered wood, empty of intent yet perfectly balanced—this is how one attains the highest name and true fulfillment.

On the road, one in ten is killed, and people greatly fear it. Yet the harms of sensual desire lead straight to death, and none avoid them. How grave the excess!

Lü’s note: Shan Bao embodied the one whose form perishes while life remains; Zhang Yi, the one whose possessions overflow while his form is neglected. Bao entered and hid; Yi exited and exposed. Both acted with intent. To stand like dry wood is to be without intent; the center is not what lags behind.

Yi Du’s note: A good shepherd watches those lagging behind and whips them, guiding them to follow the principle without loss. Shan Bao and Zhang Yi both failed to whip the laggards.

To enter and hide is to enter further; to exit and expose is to exit further. To stand like dry wood in the center is to be without intent regarding entry or exit. Attain this reality, and one’s name will surely reach its peak.

The danger of one in ten killed on the road is a peril of human society, easily seen and avoided. The perils of yin and yang in the space of mats and meals are subtle and hard to discern, so people do not guard against them.

As Laozi said: 'They rush to the place of death.'

Bi Xu’s note: Nurturing life is like herding sheep—those who take shortcuts fall behind and must be whipped. Shan Bao nurtured his inner self but neglected his outer; Zhang Yi cultivated his outer self but neglected his inner. Both failed to whip the laggards.

To enter and hide means to retreat into seclusion, dull to worldly affairs. To exit and expose means to chase after worldly trends, forgetting self-cultivation. To stand like dry wood in the center is to be dull and unadaptable. Free from these three attachments, one attains the eternal name and reaches the ultimate.

The dangers of the road are obvious and easy to guard against; the subtle harms of mats and meals are hard to maintain. Thus, the beauty of goodness has long been a hidden peril, and the world remains unaware.

Yong Zhai’s note: The hairpin and broom are tools for sweeping and cleaning. Herding sheep should follow nature, yet whipping the laggards means following the heavenly principle while also fulfilling human effort. Shan Bao and Zhang Yi both failed in human effort and could not wholly entrust themselves to heaven.

This passage is most intimate to the scholar’s own station. Extend this principle, and one understands what comes before and after—it speaks to the intent of heaven’s Dao and humanity’s Dao.

'Do not enter and hide' means not to be fixated on stillness; 'do not exit and expose' means not to be bound to activity. To stand like dry wood in the center is to be without intent regarding movement or stillness.

Master these three phrases, and one may be called a perfected person!

The fear of the road illustrates the danger of mats and meals—it is the axe that hews at life’s root, a warning to curb desire.

The invocator of the ancestral temple, clad in dark robes, approached the pen and said to the pig: 'Why do you hate death? I will fatten you for three months, fast for ten days, purify for three, spread white reeds, and place your shoulder and rump upon the carved platter. Would you accept this?'

Planning for the pig, he said: 'Better to eat chaff and be left in the pen.' Planning for himself, he said: 'If living brings the honor of carriages and caps, and dying brings rest upon the ancestral altar amid the ancestral temple, I would accept it.'

Planning for the pig, he rejects it; planning for himself, he accepts it. What makes the pig different?

Guo’s note: Desire leads to the loss of the self—principle and constant are the same, whether for man or beast.

Lü’s note: Planning for the pig, he rejects it; planning for himself, he accepts it. Is it that he loves himself less than the pig? It is the world that burdens him! Only by abandoning the world and forgetting life can one be free of burdens.

Yi Du’s note: Planning for the tortoise, it would rather drag its tail in the mud than leave its bones to be venerated. Planning for the pig, it would rather eat chaff in the pen than be placed upon the carved platter. This means that to dwell in wealth and honor against the principle of life is worse than to follow the principle of life and delight in poverty and lowliness."

Zhuangzi compares himself to the tortoise and the worldly to the pig—his subtle meaning is thus revealed.

Bixu’s note: When an oxhide is flayed to make a drum to marshal the three armies, for the ox’s sake it would be better to bear the yoke. When the white fox’s pelt becomes the Son of Heaven’s robe and adorns the ancestral hall, for the fox’s sake it would be better to roam the marshes. This is why the pen-raised pig does not wish to be placed upon the carved platter—it is the purport of attaining life and attaining destiny.

Yongzhai’s note: *Xuanduan* is a cap. *Teng* means to feed with fodder. *Tun* is the same as *zhuan* (pig). *Xun* is the peach. A curved vessel that can gather things is called a *julou*, like a dustpan or wicker basket. In the *Zuozhuan* (Duke Xuan, second year): "The chef stewed the bear’s paw improperly, killed him, and placed him in a basket." This is the same meaning. One may possess the nobility of carriages and crowns in life, yet end by dying in form, placing oneself upon the chopping block, within the dustpan or wicker basket—would one truly be content? Planning for the pig is one thing, yet planning for oneself is another—why is this so?

The four chapters above share a similar purport. When Jun Chang pursues the cicada, his focus remains undivided—this also elucidates the guarding of pure *qi* in the previous chapter. The diver who steers the boat as if by spirit embodies the meaning of "entering the spirit through mastery of principle." The shepherd who drives the sheep with his whip demonstrates the rule of nurturing life. The invocator who speaks for the pig warns against the delusion of carriages and crowns. All these serve to shatter the worldly man’s confusion and return him to the sublime purport of attaining life. The meaning of the classic is clear and plain—no further gloss is needed.

Plucking the hairpin—its upper part sliced like a rush’s tip—Li’s old annotation reads *ba* (to grasp), while *Yongzhai Oral Exegesis* equates the root *ji* (技) with *zhi* (枝, branch). "Plucking the hairpin" thus refers to a broom. Most commentaries pass over this without discussion. Master Wuyin Fan states: *Ba* (拔) should be read as *fu* (拂, to brush), and *fu-jing* (拂警) are tools held by servants. The meaning is coherent, though the phonetic gloss remains unclear. Examining the character’s form and reasoning through its principle, I find that *ji* (技) should be *fu* (帗). A minor scribal error in transmission occurred. The *Jian Rhymes* notes: *chen* (忱) is pronounced *fu* (拂) and shares the same sense as *ai* (愛)—a full-feathered duster, also held by attendants.

As for *tun xun* (豚循), Lu’s *Pronunciation and Meaning* states the character should be *zhuan ji* (篆輯), referring to the painted hearse used to carry coffins. *Ju* (聚) should be *mo* (茉), pronounced *cai guan*. *Chang* (偿) should be *lou* (篓), pronounced *li jiu*, denoting burial in a *mo*-coated, wicker-bound coffin. Yet the transmitted text of the classic retains these characters as they stand. Further examination of the *Liji*’s "Tan Gong" chapter reveals: "The Son of Heaven’s hearse is coated with *mo* and painted with dragon patterns, using *ning* (柠) [as adornment]." It also states: "A *lou* (篓) is set up," where *lou* is synonymous with *liu ju* (柳菆)—a gathering of wood to reinforce the coffin before coating it. The dragon patterns refer to the carved dragon designs.

The classic’s purport thus deepens: those who pursue wealth and rank trade their lives for death, yet even a pig would refuse such an exchange—how could a human be inferior to a pig?

**Chapter Two: Attaining Life**

Duke Huan was hunting in the marshes, with Guan Zhong driving his chariot, when he saw a ghost. The Duke grasped Guan Zhong’s hand and asked, “What did you see, Father Zhong?” Guan Zhong replied, “Your servant saw nothing.” The Duke returned, distraught, and took to his sickbed, refusing to emerge for days.

Among the Qi scholars was one named Huangzi Gaofang, who said, “The Duke has harmed himself—how could a ghost harm him? When the *qi* of anger and sorrow scatters and fails to return, it causes deficiency. If it rises but does not descend, it makes one prone to rage; if it descends but does not rise, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. If it neither rises nor descends but lodges in the center of the body, striking the heart, it causes illness.”

Duke Huan asked, “Then do ghosts exist?” Huangzi replied, “There are *shen* and *lü* in the depths, and *ao* with its topknot. In the cluttered soil within doorways, thunder dwells; in the northeast, *bei’e* and *xielong* leap; in the northwest, *yiyang* resides. In water there is *wangxiang*; in mounds, *xing*; in mountains, *kui*; in the wilds, *panghuang*; and in marshes, *weiyi*.”

The Duke asked, “What does *weiyi* look like?” Huangzi said, “*Weiyi* is as large as a wheel hub, as long as a chariot shaft, clad in purple robes with a crimson crown. As a creature, it loathes the sound of thunderous chariots and, upon hearing it, clutches its head and stands upright. Those who see it are destined for hegemony.”

Duke Huan laughed heartily and said, “This is what I saw!” He then straightened his robes and cap, sat with Huangzi, and before the day was out, his illness had vanished without his notice.

**Guo’s Commentary:** This chapter speaks of how distress burdens life when one fails to understand, while tranquility restores one’s nature when one grasps the principle.

**Lü’s Commentary:** It shows that anxiety and doubt allow ghosts no power to harm, yet one harms oneself; when doubt dissipates, illness departs of its own accord. Thus, those who preserve their Heaven-given nature and prevent external things from intruding are rightly beyond harm.

How did Huangzi Gaofang know the names and forms of ghosts? In ancient times, those among the people whose essence was undivided—men called *wu* and women called *xi*—could, by dwelling in the abodes of ghosts and spirits, discern their names and forms. Was there no transmission of this knowledge?

**Yi Zhu’s Note:** These names of ghosts were passed down by the ancients. Zhuangzi cited them, embedding deeper principles within. Those whose learning has not reached the Dao of Heaven cannot debate their existence or nonexistence. Confucius said, “If one cannot serve men, how can one serve ghosts?” He thus left the matter unaddressed.

What Duke Huan saw in the marshes, Huangzi Gaofang resolved by addressing his doubt. By describing *weiyi* and saying that those who see it attain hegemony, his words struck the Duke’s heart. His doubt dissolved, and his illness vanished unnoticed. When people today fall ill and consult divination, or seek cures through shamans, they recover by the same principle—though the ignorant remain unaware.

**Bixu’s Commentary:** Guan Zhong, free of intent, saw no ghost; Duke Huan, burdened by intent, saw a ghost and fell ill. When yang *qi* surges upward and yin congeals, it breeds rage; when yang *qi* sinks and yang hides, it breeds forgetfulness. If it neither rises nor falls but lodges in the body’s center, striking the heart, illness follows. When the Duke asked about the existence of ghosts, Huangzi answered by describing their forms, culminating in *weiyi*—precisely matching what the Duke had seen. Thus, whether desires are great or small, their fulfillment brings joy; whether doubts are vast or trivial, their resolution brings release. In the moment, the key lies in awakening. This is why the perfected cannot abandon words.

**Yongzhai’s Note:** *Tanyi* is a disease of reversed *qi*. *Shen* dwells in the mud of ditches. The Duke saw his vision in the marshes, so he asked only about *weiyi*. Initially suspecting a demon, he fell ill from fear; when told that seeing it foretold hegemony, he rejoiced, and his illness vanished. This differs from seeing a pig caked in mud or a cartload of ghosts. Yet since the Sage included such matters in the hexagrams’ judgments, such occurrences in the world are not strange.

Duke Huan’s illness arose from doubt and could not be cured by medicine. Huangzi dispelled delusion with delusion, achieving a cure without drugs. Thus, the existence of ghosts depends on the mind’s arising and ceasing, while the mind’s likes and dislikes reveal human delusion. When delusion departs, likes and dislikes align with truth; when the original mind is clear, arising and ceasing no longer depend on externals. Those who chase delusion and lose their true nature are like those who see ghosts and fall ill. Who, then, knows the best way to heal? Huangzi’s words—“The Duke harms himself; how could a ghost harm him?”—are the finest remedy. This resembles how playing with tiles banishes heartache, or how the removal of a bow’s shadow cures a suspicious illness.

If one can purify the mind, wash away perceptions, and merge with inner emptiness—leaving no dust, untroubled by the myriad phenomena—how could ghosts appear? How could illness enter?

Though the recorded ghost names seem fantastical, the *Confucian Family Sayings* also mentions *kui* and *wangxiang*. The *Zuozhuan* speaks of “new ghosts being great, old ghosts small,” and the *Records of the Grand Historian* recounts the Marquis of Dili presenting a jade disk. Thus, ghosts are not nonexistent. But if yin and yang each remain in their proper place, neither harming the other, it is enough. The Classic states, “When the world follows the Dao, its ghosts lack numinosity.”

**Jiyuzi trained fighting cocks for the king.** After ten days, the king asked, “Are the cocks ready?” Jiyuzi replied, “Not yet. They are still vain and rely on their *qi*.”

After another ten days, the king asked again. Jiyuzi said, “Not yet. They still react to echoes and shadows.”

After another ten days, the king asked again. Jiyuzi said, “Not yet. They still glare fiercely and bristle with *qi*.”

After another ten days, the king asked again. Jiyuzi said, “Almost. Though other cocks may crow, they show no change. They appear like wooden cocks, their virtue complete. No other cock dares respond—they turn and flee.”

**Guo’s Commentary:** This chapter speaks of nurturing to perfection, which leaves one unmatched externally—how much more so for self-perfection?

**Lü’s Commentary:** If one’s nurtured state resembles the wooden cock—unmoved by external stimuli—then none can rival them.

**Yidu’s Annotation:** This uses the training of cocks as a metaphor for nurturing life, wherein cultivation proceeds by degrees. "Vain and reliant on *qi*" describes emptiness without substance, self-aggrandizing. "Reacting to echoes and shadows" speaks to swift responsiveness. "Glaring fiercely and bristling with *qi*" seeks an opponent while asserting one’s own superiority. "Though other cocks crow, they show no change" means facing a challenger without response, forgetting victory and defeat. When they "appear like wooden cocks" and no other cock dares respond, one knows that with virtue complete, not only is the self without intent, but it also prevents others from forming intent—this is the pinnacle of nurturing.

**Bixu’s Annotation:** "Vain and reliant on *qi*" denotes haughty boasting. "Reacting to echoes and shadows" refers to ostentatious posturing. "Glaring fiercely and bristling with *qi*" displays a contentious demeanor. "Though crowing, showing no change" means dust no longer dazzles. When they "appear like wooden cocks" and no other cock dares respond, the heart is ashen and the form withered—nothing contends with them.

**Yongzhai’s Note:** Responding to sounds or moving at shadows means the heart is still swayed by external things. "Glaring fiercely and bristling with *qi*" describes spirit and *qi* flourishing while the form remains unmoved. The first phrase, "vain and reliant," places *qi* externally; "glaring fiercely and bristling" places *qi* internally. When they "appear like wooden cocks," spirit and *qi* are both complete. This speaks of the art of guarding *qi*, using the cock as a metaphor. "Vain and reliant on *qi*" exposes *qi* to seek an opponent. "Reacting to echoes and shadows" pursues externals while neglecting the internal. "Glaring fiercely and bristling with *qi*" fills the interior and manifests outwardly, intending to overpower. "Appearing like wooden cocks" means inner harmony and outer transformation, transcending things to stand alone. No other cock dares respond—those who see them turn and flee. This illustrates the effect of nurturing *qi* to perfect spirit: when spirit is whole, awe is manifest. If one who studies the Dao reaches a state where their form resembles withered wood, *qi* and spirit need no nurturing to become whole. Even ghosts and spirits revere them—how much more their peers? This is how the ancients avoided contention yet excelled in victory.

**Note on the Text:** "Are the cocks ready?" is ungrammatical. According to the *Liezi*, the original reads, "Can the cocks fight yet?"—Zhuangzi’s phrasing is abbreviated.

**Confucius observed at Lüliang,** where the waterfall plunged thirty *ren*, its rapids foaming forty *li*, a torrent where eels, dragons, fish, and turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and assumed he was in distress, seeking death. He sent his disciples along the current to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, hair unbound, singing as he strolled beneath the embankment. Confucius followed and questioned him: "I took you for a ghost, but now I see you are a man. May I ask if you have a method for treading water?"

The man replied, "No, I have no method. I began with what was innate, grew with my nature, and fulfilled my destiny. I enter with the swirling current and emerge with the surging flow, following the water’s Dao without imposing my will. This is how I tread it."

Confucius asked, "What do you mean by beginning with what was innate, growing with nature, and fulfilling destiny?"

The man said, "I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—this is what is innate. I grew up in water and am at ease in water—this is nature. I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—this is destiny."

**Guo’s Commentary:** "Grinding and swirling inward" describes the swirling current; "revolving and surging outward" describes the surging flow. When one possesses a singular ability and applies it without restraint, nothing in the world is difficult. Using this effortless mastery to traverse the Dao of ceaseless generation—where could one not go?

**Lü’s Commentary:** Following the principles of nature and destiny, entering with the swirling current and emerging with the surging flow, one follows the water’s Dao without imposing will—thus one can tread it. As for places where even eels and dragons cannot swim, aligning one’s virtue to harmonize with the utmost reaches of things, naturally nothing one treads is unsuitable. Being born on the hills and at ease there is what is innate—this is not a matter of nature but of human effort. Growing up in water and at ease there is nature—this is one’s singular ability. Without such nature, even if one practices, one cannot achieve what others cannot.

**Yidu’s Annotation:** The man at Lüliang treads water with a Dao yet without imposing will—he follows principle. Thus, he enters with the swirling current and emerges with the surging flow without drowning. "Beginning with what is innate" means having a foundation; "growing with nature" means having something natural; "fulfilling destiny" means not knowing the cause or reason, yet it is not natural either. Hence, he is at ease on the hills and in water without knowing why.

**Bixu’s Annotation:** "Swirling" is like a millstone’s inward rotation. "Surging" is like a gushing spring. Imposing one’s will against the water prevents the completion of nature and destiny. Born on the hills and at ease there, one does not lose what is innate. Growing up in water and entering without peril stems from sharing the same fundamental nature. Swimming in the torrent without knowing why is the fulfillment of heavenly destiny. Understanding the essence of life is like swimming at Lüliang—it comes from habit and completion.

**Fuzhai’s Note:** This passage shares the same meaning as the earlier one on steering a boat. "What is innate" refers to the original state. *Mencius* says, "Those who speak of nature refer to what is innate"—meaning the natural principles of nature and destiny. "Following the water’s Dao without imposing will" expresses compliance without resistance. Being at ease on the hills or in water means following one’s nature without knowing why. The terms "nature" and "destiny" are initially indistinct—this is merely a matter of phrasing. The man at Lüliang’s treading of water and singing lies in following the water’s Dao without imposing will, so the water cannot harm him. If one navigates the world by following human Dao without imposing will, others will not harm them either.

Extending this principle to all interactions with things—where could one not attain wholeness? Beginning with what is innate, one relies on practice to achieve mastery; growing through nature, long habit becomes spontaneity; fulfilling destiny, one merges with water and forgets how it is so. This is called preserving wholeness through Heaven.

This chapter aligns with the idea of "not encountering things"—engaging with the world without harming it. Could these words serve as the standard for navigating life?

**Note on "并" (bìng):** The character formerly had no alternate pronunciation; it should be read identically to "傍" (bàng), in the falling tone.

When Zi Qing carved wood into a *lian*, upon completion, those who saw it marveled as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits. The Lord of Lu saw it and asked, "What technique did you employ?" He replied, "I am but a craftsman—what technique could I possess? Though if I must speak of it, there is one thing: when I prepare to craft the *lian*, I never dare to deplete my *qi*; I must fast to still my mind. After three days of fasting, I no longer harbor thoughts of rewards, rank, or emoluments. After five days, I no longer dwell on praise or blame, skill or clumsiness. After seven days, I suddenly forget I possess four limbs and a physical form. At that moment, the court and its affairs vanish; my skill becomes whole, and external distractions dissolve. Only then do I enter the mountain forests to observe the natural patterns of trees. When the form is perfectly embodied, only then do I begin carving. Otherwise, I desist. Thus, I unite Heaven with Heaven—the reason the vessel seems divine lies here!"

**Guo’s Commentary:** Regarding the court as nonexistent, all desires for favor vanish. He selects wood from the village, never departing from its natural state. Exhausting the marvels of the material, it appears as if crafted by ghosts or spirits.

**Lü’s Commentary:** The reason the vessel seems divine is just this. If external distractions remain unresolved while one seeks to wander among the creations of things, perfection cannot be attained.

**Yi Du’s Commentary:** The craftsman’s name was Qing. The *lian* is an instrument for halting music, also called *yuxiang*, shaped like a crouching tiger with twenty-seven serrated teeth on its back. "Never depleting *qi*" means emptying the mind to stillness. "Not harboring thoughts of rewards, rank, or emoluments" means forgetting gain.

Free from concerns of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness—this is forgetting reputation. Forgetting one’s own limbs and form, the spirit remains whole and merges with Heaven. Thus one regards the court as nonexistent, and the disturbances of external affairs dissolve. Only then does one enter the mountain forests, observing which trees’ forms align with the furnace’s needs. Then, and only then, does one apply the hand—without forcing, extending one’s own Heaven to meet the Heaven of the material. This is why the vessel seems divine.

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:** To labor the mind depletes *qi*; to be without desire is stillness. A heart unburdened by rewards, rank, or emoluments rejects external affairs. Free from concerns of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness, inner thoughts cease. Forgetting one’s form is to forget both inner and outer. Only then does one enter the mountain forests, selecting wood in its natural state and matching its natural craftsmanship—so wondrous it seems the work of ghosts or spirits, and even the Lord of Lu suspected it bore protective charms.

**Yongzhai’s Commentary:** The *ju* is the frame for bells and drums, akin to *gouli*, a wooden beast-shaped stand for suspending them. Free from concerns of rank, praise, or blame, forgetting one’s limbs—this means guarding the pure *qi*, keeping external things at bay. One observes the material’s innate nature and form, as if already shaped, then takes and uses it, aligning one’s own nature with the material’s. Never depleting *qi*, the spirit remains whole. Cultivating fasting of the mind and stillness is the Way to nourish spirit and *qi*, hence its manifestation in use. With skill concentrated and external distractions dissolved, one observes which wood’s nature aligns with the *ju*’s form, then applies the hand—expending little effort yet achieving great results. This is why the vessel seems divine. Yet the marvel of Heaven meeting Heaven cannot be fully expressed in words; only those who exhaust the spirit and know transformation may partake in it. If one remains unmoved by rewards, rank, praise, or blame, then in all actions, how could one not achieve the divine?

Dongye Ji demonstrated his charioteering before Duke Zhuang, advancing and retreating in perfect alignment, turning left and right as if guided by compass and rule. The Duke believed even the finest patterns could not surpass it and ordered him to perform a hundred intricate maneuvers before returning. Yan He encountered him and entered to say, “Ji’s horses are about to fail.” The Duke remained silent and did not respond. Soon after, the horses indeed faltered and returned. The Duke asked, “How did you know?” He replied, “Their strength was exhausted, yet you still demanded more—hence I knew they would fail.”

The craftsman’s chisel turns as if bound by compass and rule, his fingers transforming with the material without mental calculation. Thus his spirit-terrace remains unified and unobstructed. Forgetting the feet, the shoes fit perfectly; forgetting the waist, the belt fits perfectly; knowing forgets right and wrong, the mind is at ease; neither inwardly changing nor outwardly following, all things align. Beginning with ease and never straying from it—this is the ease of forgetting ease.

**Guo’s Commentary:** The horses’ strength was exhausted, yet more was demanded—hence their failure. This shows that even the most perfect must not be overreached. Though the craftsman’s skill is great, it still follows compass and rule—this speaks of working with the material’s natural ease. When all parts of the body are at ease, one forgets the self entirely. Right and wrong arise from unease; when one is content with what comes, there is no need for change or compliance. Thus, even those who know ease have not yet attained true ease.

**Lü’s Commentary:** Though Ji’s charioteering was flawless, it could not avoid failure. After the horses’ strength was spent, to persist in action is to strive where life has nothing left to give, where knowledge has no recourse—such effort yields no wisdom. The craftsman’s hand turns, ever more aligned with compass and rule, meaning his fingers’ movement refines the rule’s precision. The more refined, the more his work aligns without trace, as if the material transforms naturally, without waiting for the mind’s deliberation to match square and circle. Only thus does the spirit-terrace remain unified and unobstructed. As for forgetting the feet, the waist, the mind, and right and wrong—never straying from ease—is this not proof of acting without mental calculation?

**Yi Du’s Commentary:** Ji’s charioteering aligned with compass and rule, and Duke Zhuang believed even the most intricate patterns could not surpass it. He ordered Ji to perform a hundred intricate turns before returning. The horses’ strength was already exhausted, yet more was demanded—hence it was clear they would fail. This illustrates the principle of life’s nature: one must follow what is perfectly fitting and not overreach. The craftsman’s hand moves swiftly with compass and rule, guided by the hand while the heart responds—never lingering. Thus the spirit-terrace remains empty and unified, unshackled by profit or desire.

When the feet are forgotten, every shoe fits perfectly; when the waist is forgotten, every belt sits comfortably; when right and wrong are forgotten, the heart finds ease in all things. With no inner inclination to change and no outer compulsion to follow, one encounters affairs, observes their convergence, and acts according to ritual—thus every convergence becomes fitting. This is the ease of forgetting ease.

**Bixu’s Commentary:** Charioteering aligned with compass and rule is like weaving patterned brocade, guiding the horses to turn in hooked arcs, a hundred departures and returns all resuming their original course. Han Ying said: "Shun was skilled in employing people, Zaofu in employing horses. He did not exhaust his people, so none became idle; he did not exhaust his horses, so none became worn out." A horse’s stumbling and defeat arise from overdriving; a people’s exhaustion of wisdom stems from oppressive governance. Thus one who understands fate does not strive for what knowledge cannot remedy. The craftsman’s response to things is unobstructed, his nature unadulterated—his fingers transform with the object. With no mental hesitation, his spirit-terrace remains unified and unbound.

Forgetting the feet and waist is but a minor matter; when the heart forgets right and wrong, even the root is forgotten—how much more the branches? Inner and outer lie within oneself; all encounters become thus. Naturally at ease and constantly at ease, this is the ease of no-ease. The subtlety of the craftsman’s hammer is the same.

**Yongqi’s Note:** The skill of charioteering resembles recognizing patterns in weaving—hence it is said, "patterns do not exceed." "A hundred hooks" refers to a hundred turns in the hunt. Though the horses’ strength is spent, driving them relentlessly ensures failure. Even with skill, overuse leads to collapse—how can one overtax the spirit? The craftsman’s hammer spins the wheel as if covering it, naturally conforming to compass and rule, like Wu Daozi painting the halo of a divine image in a single stroke. "Fingers transforming with the object" is like the saying on calligraphy: "The hand knows not the brush, the brush knows not the hand; hand and brush both forgotten, the mind does not linger." This is what is meant by "sensory awareness ceases while the spirit moves"—thus the spirit-terrace remains pure and unconfined.

"Ease" means peace; "convergence" is like attainment—attaining the Dao and reaching ease. The inner realm becomes pure and unchanging; though engaging with things, one no longer knows what one is doing. Beginning with ease and never straying from it, over time even ease is forgotten. The *Book of Songs* says: "Holding the reins like weaving, the two flanks move like dance." This illustrates the meaning of "patterns do not exceed." The weaver gathers threads here to form patterns there—just as the skilled charioteer holds the reins above while the horses harmonize below. "A hundred hooks" refers to circularity. Driving without cease ensures failure; demanding more when strength is spent harms not only the horse but also exhausts the driver. The Duke kept his counsel, unwilling to dampen Ji’s resolve. Soon the outcome proved his foresight, yet it came too late to avert danger. Those who hear loyal advice but cannot act lose as much. The craftsman’s wheel spins within compass and rule—among the explanations, Master Lü’s is most apt, particularly his discussion of the word "cover." Yongzhai labored over the word "cover" before arriving at precision; combining the strengths of both yields perfection.

The passage’s intent is simply this: one who attains life’s Dao understands the principles of things, and things naturally align with him—not by striving to conform, but through profound skill. Roaming the world, he is never ill at ease—this is the ease of forgetting ease. If one can live in the world without clashing with things, there is no place that is not ease.

There was a man named Sun Xiu who came knocking at Bian Qingzi’s door, lamenting: "In my village, I am not called unrefined; in peril, I am not called cowardly. Yet when tilling the fields, I meet with bad years; when serving a lord, I meet with troubled times. Shunned by my village, banished by the district—what offense have I committed against Heaven?"

"Do you resent encountering this fate?" Master Bian replied: "Have you alone not heard of the perfect person’s way of conduct? They forget their liver and gall, leave behind their ears and eyes, wander in boundless vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roam freely in the work of non-action—this is called acting without reliance, growing without domination. Now you adorn knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate the self to expose filth, shining brightly as if carrying the sun and moon in your stride. You have preserved your bodily form intact, kept all nine orifices complete, and avoided midway affliction with deafness, blindness, lameness, or disability to be counted among the living—this is already fortune enough. Why then do you have leisure to resent Heaven? Be gone!"

Sunzi departed. Master Bian entered, sat, and someone asked a question. He looked up to the sky and sighed. A disciple inquired: "Master, why do you sigh?" Master Bian said: "Just now, Xiu came, and I spoke to him of the perfect person’s virtue. I fear he was startled and thus fell into confusion." The disciple said: "Not so. Was what Sunzi said correct?"

"Was what the Master said incorrect? It is not that it could not confuse what is correct. Was what Sunzi said incorrect? Was what the Master said correct? He was already confused when he came—how can he be blamed?"

Master Bian said: "Not so. Once there was a crow that alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu delighted in it, prepared a grand feast to honor it, and performed the *Nine Shao* to entertain it. The crow then grew sorrowful and anxious, its vision blurred, and it dared not eat or drink. This is called nourishing the crow with one’s own nourishment. As for nourishing the crow with the crow’s own nourishment, one should let it nest in deep forests, float upon rivers and lakes, and feed on whatever it encounters—then it would be at ease on level ground.

Now, Xiu is a man of simple sincerity and limited understanding. When I spoke to him of the perfect person’s virtue, it was like burdening a mole with chariots and horses or delighting a quail with bells and drums. How could he not be startled?

Guo’s Commentary: Whatever is not of true nature is but dust and grime. All self-initiated endeavors are the work of non-action; following one’s inclination without reliance, acting without domination, letting things grow of themselves without governing them.

The nourishment of self and the nourishment of crow each have their proper use, both attaining the harmony of nature and destiny.

Lü’s Commentary: The essence of this chapter lies in preserving life, achieving spiritual perfection and the return of essence, becoming one with Heaven. What Sun Xiu practices is the opposite. Upon hearing these words, he could not but feel sorrow and alarm, his vision blurred, and dared not partake—hence the concluding analogy of the sea crow.

Yi Du’s Commentary: Master Bian Qingzi was Sun Xiu’s teacher. Xiu once said: ‘In my village, no one calls me unrefined; in times of peril, no one calls me cowardly. Yet when I till the fields, I do not encounter a bountiful year; when I serve a lord, I do not meet a well-governed age. In my village, I am shunned by others; in my district, I am driven away. What crime have I committed against Heaven to receive such a fate?’

His teacher replied: ‘Have you alone not heard of the conduct of the perfect person? When one forgets the liver and gall, the five viscera all become empty...’"

To abandon the ears and eyes is to prevent the six dusts from entering. Thus one wanders beyond the dust, carefree and without action. The conduct of the true ruler arises from non-action, hence it acts without reliance; the enduring governance of the true master arises from non-governance, hence it endures without domination. Now you cultivate the body and adorn knowledge, seeking to distinguish yourself in the world—no wonder you suffer harm. To preserve your form without premature death is already fortunate compared to others; how can you find leisure to resent Heaven or blame others?

Fearing that Sun Xiu might not understand and be alarmed by these words, the master then offered the analogy of the sea crow, saying that those who nurture life each follow the natural suitability of their lot to reach fulfillment.

Bixu’s Commentary: Sun Xiu claims his conduct is refined and his resolve courageous, yet his undertakings meet no success—this is because he does not understand Heaven’s decree and vainly indulges in sorrow and lament. The conduct of the perfect person seeks no recognition from others; it forgets the liver and gall, let alone joy and anger. It abandons the ears and eyes, let alone sights and sounds. Cultivating courage, being shunned or driven away—these are all dust and grime. To act while forgetting oneself is to be free of all affairs. Now Sun Xiu acts with reliance, seeks to dominate while desiring longevity, and craves recognition through self-aggrandizement. Even if he narrowly escapes misfortune, he is but a man of intact form. For Sun Xiu strives after what cannot be achieved in nurturing life, so Master Bian answers with what cannot be altered by knowledge. This is like the great sound and perfect tone that must confound the vulgar minds of alleyways and markets—how could he not be alarmed?

Yongzhai says: *Bin* (宾) should be read as *bin* (摈), meaning "to cast aside." To proclaim one’s purity and startle the foolish is to set oneself apart. *Kuǎnqǐ* (款启) refers to small apertures, a metaphor for his limited vision. The teachings are too lofty—how could he not be startled? This is a rebuke of the shallow understanding of contemporary scholars who do not grasp the great Dao. To feed with ease is to let one eat naturally. The analogy of the sea crow has been discussed in previous chapters.

To delight in Heaven’s decree and understand fate is to be free of sorrow; to fathom principle and exhaust one’s nature is to have no doubts. What Sun Xiu describes diverges greatly from the teachings of Heaven’s decree and the nature of principle. Thus Master Bian instructs him that the conduct of the perfect person—by forgetting the liver and gall, emptying the inner self, and abandoning the ears and eyes, stilling the outer self—then wanders beyond the dust and grime. All worldly affairs and traces of action are dust and grime; to depart from these is to make every movement, whether standing, sitting, or lying down, an endeavor of non-action—what is called "transcending the worldly while within the world." What is there to rely upon? What governance is there to dominate?

Now you adorn knowledge and cultivate the body, shining like the sun and moon, only to attract the calamities of the world. To preserve your form without premature death is already fortunate—how can you find time to resent Heaven? This is to sharply awaken his delusion and guide him back to understanding. The analogy of the sea bird is clear in its meaning.

This chapter begins by discussing life, which all people value. Some over-nurture it and harm life; fate lies with Heaven and cannot be defied, yet some destroy it through their own actions. If one comprehends these two truths, one can preserve life and be at peace with fate—this is the way of deep roots and firm foundations, of longevity and enduring vision. Thus, whatever cannot be achieved in nurturing life, whatever Heaven’s decree cannot alter, one distances oneself from, knowing it is not one’s proper duty. Yet one possesses a pure and complete Heaven that must not be departed from even for a moment.

Consider the drunkard’s view of a carriage or the giant’s regard for a railing—what room is there for concern? The examples of catching cicadas and steering a boat illustrate how accumulated practice leads to mastery; herding sheep and fearing dangerous paths show how the whip follows to warn of peril. The discussion of competition illustrates how those who covet rank are no better than those who see ghosts, while those who cannot perceive delusion are easily confused. The subsequent analogies all serve to expound the principle of life—truly earnest and incisive!

The nourishment of life has its fixed allotment; it is not gained by seeking nor lost by not seeking. The breath of life is difficult to sustain without anxiety; it cannot be escaped by luck or evaded by wisdom. One must cultivate human affairs to accord with Heaven’s principle, seeking only to be without remorse. Longevity or premature death, fortune or misfortune—these are not to be eagerly pursued.

Whether one retreats to the mountains and valleys for pure cultivation or serves in the court with great undertakings, whether one nurtures life within or governs others without, it is all to beautify human relations and promote education, ultimately converging in the principle of the Dao and virtue. Yet how few truly know life is to be valued and can be vigilant even in the midst of feasting and repose!

Only when one appears like a wooden chicken when observed, and when driving does not exhaust one’s strength, has one grasped the principle of life and approached the conduct of the perfect person. The conclusion, with the sea crow of the Lu suburbs hearing bells and drums and growing sorrowful, shows that when external nurturance is lost, the inner nature is harmed. If one knows how to nurture, one knows how to preserve. The key lies in understanding one’s own life, extending it to benefit the lives of others, and harmonizing with things. To forget harmony is to find no disharmony.

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin on "The Mountain Trees" (Chapter One)

When Master Zhuang journeyed through the mountains, he saw a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. Asking the reason, he was told: "It is of no use." Master Zhuang said: "This tree, by being useless, has attained its full span of years."

Emerging from the mountains, the Master lodged at the home of an old friend. Delighted, his friend ordered a servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked: "One can caw, the other cannot— which should we kill?" The host replied: "Kill the one that cannot caw."

The next day, a disciple asked Master Zhuang: "Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by being useless, attained its full span of years; today, the master’s goose, by being useless, was killed. Where will you position yourself?" Master Zhuang laughed and said: "I will position myself between usefulness and uselessness."

Yet between usefulness and uselessness is but an approximation, not the true Way, and thus one remains entangled in burdens. If, however, one rides the Dao and virtue, floating freely, it is otherwise. Without praise or blame, now a dragon, now a serpent, one transforms with the times, never clinging to a single form. Rising and falling, taking harmony as one’s measure, one floats upon the ancestor of the ten thousand things. Treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by them—how then could one be burdened?

This is the method of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor. As for the nature of the ten thousand things and the transmission of human relations, it is not so. Union leads to separation, completion to destruction, integrity to humiliation, honor to criticism, action to loss, worthiness to schemes, and worthlessness to deceit. How can one be certain of anything?

Alas! Disciples, take heed: it is only in the realm of Dao and virtue.

Guo’s Annotation: Though one might position oneself here, as it still entails burdens, one ultimately does not remain. As for those who ride the Dao and virtue, floating freely—Master Zhuang also dwells there, yet without fixation. Thus, he does not adhere to one path but transforms with the times, for only by moving with change can one remain perpetually unobstructed.

Lü’s Annotation: The world’s sages and worthies are often unaccommodated by their age, their burden lying precisely in their usefulness. Thus, Master Zhuang repeatedly warns against the entanglements of usefulness. Yet how many fools and incompetents have been killed for their inability to caw? Can uselessness alone guarantee escape? The tree in the mountains and the master’s horse—both err equally. Therefore, one must choose a position between usefulness and uselessness, yet even this resembles the Dao without being the Dao. For the essence of the Dao does not reside in either extreme, nor in the mean between them. Thus, even between usefulness and uselessness, one is not free from burdens. But if one rides the Dao and virtue, floating freely, then there is neither praise nor blame, neither honor nor disgrace. Now a dragon, now a serpent, one cannot be confined to worthiness or folly. All waxing and waning, rising and sinking, one transforms with the times, harmonizing without discord. How could this depend on being useful or useless? One simply floats upon the ancestor of the ten thousand things. The ancestor of the ten thousand things is like the father of all fathers. In this way, one treats things as things yet is not treated as a thing by them—how then could one be burdened?

As for the nature of the ten thousand things and the transmission of human relations: union inevitably leads to separation, completion to destruction, prosperity to humiliation, honor to criticism. Thus, how can one hope to escape burdens by positioning oneself between usefulness and uselessness? To be free from burdens, is it not only in the realm of Dao and virtue?

Yi Du’s Annotation: The principles of the world unfold like a crossbow’s trigger—one may ride them but not control them. The seasons of the world pass like an arrow—one may follow them but not grasp them.

Thus, the tree of yesterday survived by being useless, while the timber of today perishes by being useless. Therefore, the sage follows the times and rides the principles, flowing with things without stagnating in them, transforming with the world without being bound by it. Now a dragon, now a serpent—its changes are unfathomable, beyond praise or blame. Moving with the times, taking harmony as its measure, it drifts in the ancestor of the ten thousand things, treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by them, responding to endless transformations. This is the "principle valued by the former kings."

As for the nature of the ten thousand things and the transmission of human relations, one cannot escape separation and union, completion and destruction. How can certainty be attained? To avoid this, is it not only in the realm of Dao and virtue?

Bixu’s Annotation: The timber that no longer exists has lost its pattern; the great root of the tree retains its substance. The perfected person conceals their substance and blends their pattern, thus moving through the world without bias. Dao and virtue are ever-renewing, drifting without trace. Free from praise or blame, one can gather all things like a closed sack. Like the dragon and serpent, one can appear or vanish. Transforming with the times, one adapts to the world’s needs. Without rigid action, one can rise or fall, taking harmony as the measure. In movement, one follows principle; drifting in the ancestor of things, one does not chase after ends. Thus, worldly burdens cannot touch them—this is the Way of the Great Ancients.

As for the nature of things: the worthy scheme like usable timber, while the unworthy deceive like dull blades. The realm of Dao and virtue lies in non-insistence and tracelessness.

Yongzhai says: Usefulness and uselessness still leave traces, inevitably leading to burdens. Only when good and evil are both extinguished, beyond all naming, can one fully preserve their nature. Riding Dao and virtue is to follow nature. "Now a dragon, now a serpent" illustrates adaptability to the times. Without intent, there is no praise or blame. Rigid action stems from intent. "Rising and falling" refers to the fading of traces. Taking harmony with nature as the measure, one may rise or fall as fitting. The "ancestor" is the origin.

The nature of the ten thousand things is private desire; the transmission of human relations is habit. The following lines exhaustively depict the human condition: one’s conduct in the world is not self-determined. How can one insist on certainty? They lament the impermanence of human affairs and the peril of hidden dangers, thus exhorting their disciples to recognize this. Only by following nature can one avoid harm.

Those who become sages and worthies do so through learning; those who study sages and worthies often follow paths that lead to corruption.

Only by forgetting the path in the heart can one be free from corruption.

The tree that is deemed useless survives, while the whetstone that is deemed useless perishes—this is a visible path. Yet whether one lives or dies, how can it depend solely on being useful or useless? It also hinges on what one encounters! Thus, the true person, dwelling between usefulness and uselessness, still finds it insufficient to avoid entanglement and seeks to transcend it—only the nature of what one encounters remains unknown.

Success or failure depends on one’s endowments; what one encounters depends on fate. Some say endowments belong to man while fate belongs to Heaven, dividing them into two distinct paths. Yet endowments also arise from Heaven and are cultivated by man; fate is preserved by man yet tied to Heaven. What one encounters is the trace of Heaven and man’s mutual influence, where good and ill manifest. Thus, the question of usefulness or uselessness is the concern of the worthy. To transcend these three and be free from entanglement is to enter the realm of the sage.

Only by roaming in the origin of the ten thousand things, treating each thing as a thing yet not being ensnared by things, can one escape the constraints of endowments and the bonds of fate. Therefore, the sage does not prize endowments and rarely speaks of fate.

The character *xiàng* (乡) formerly had no other pronunciation; here it is proposed to read it in the departing tone, identical to *xiàng* (向).

Shi Nan Yiliao met with the Lord of Lu, who wore a troubled expression. Master Shi Nan asked, “My lord, why do you appear so troubled?”

The Lord of Lu replied, “I have studied the Dao of the former kings and cultivated the legacy of my predecessors. I reverence the spirits, honor the worthy, and personally practice these virtues without the slightest lapse. Yet I have not escaped misfortune—this is why I am troubled.”

Master Shi Nan said, “My lord, your method for avoiding misfortune is too shallow! The sleek fox and the patterned leopard dwell in the mountains and forests, crouch in caves and cliffs—this is stillness. They move by night and rest by day—this is vigilance. Though hungry and thirsty, pressed by hardship, they still wander the rivers and lakes in search of food—this is resolve. Yet they cannot escape the perils of nets, snares, and traps. What crime have they committed?”

The disaster lies in their hides. Is not the state of Lu alone your hide? I wish for you to shed your form and cast off your hide, cleanse your heart and relinquish desire, then wander in the wilds where none dwell. In the southlands there is a city called the Land of Establishing Virtue. Its people are simple and unadorned, with little selfishness and few desires. They know how to work but not how to hoard, they give without seeking recompense. They know not where duty leads, nor where ritual directs. Wild and unconstrained in their actions, they tread the great square of the Dao. Their lives are joyful, their deaths may be buried. I wish for you to abandon your state, discard custom, and walk in mutual support with the Way.

The Lord said, “That Way is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what am I to do?”

Master Shi Nan replied, “Be without rigid form, without lingering attachment—let this be your carriage.”

The Lord said, “That Way is secluded and remote, with no people. With whom shall I be neighbor? I have no provisions, no food—how can I reach it?”

Master Shi Nan replied, “Lessen your expenditures, diminish your desires—though you have no provisions, you will yet have enough. Cross the river and float upon the sea. Gaze upon it and you will not see its shores; the farther you go, the less you will know its bounds. Those who see you off will all turn back from the shore, and you will be far from here! Thus, he who possesses others is burdened; he who is seen as possessing by others is troubled. Therefore, Yao neither possessed others nor was seen as possessing by them. I wish to rid you of your burdens, remove your troubles, and wander alone with the Way in the boundless land.

When a double-hulled boat crosses the river, and an empty boat comes drifting to strike it, even one with a biased temper will not grow angry. But if there is a person aboard, one will shout to make way or draw near.”

When one calls out and is not heard, calls again and is not heard, then upon the third call, foul words must follow. Before, one did not grow angry, but now one does; before, the boat was empty, but now it is full. If one can empty oneself and wander through the world, who could harm them?

Guo’s commentary: To possess a body and pride oneself on one’s state—though one may harbor a thousand anxieties, revere worthies, and uphold conduct, one’s worries only deepen. Thus, let one be without a body, forget the state, and entrust oneself to natural transformation, sending them to Nanyue to distance them from Lu. If each follows their own step and every person treads their own path, then the ten thousand directions are attained—is this not vast? To "leave the state and abandon customs" means to sweep clean the heart; the lord merely speaks as if truly sending them to Nanyue. "Posture rigid" refers to stumbling obstacles; "lingering abode" refers to stagnant attachment. When form levels with things and the heart transforms with them, one lodges in things to bear oneself. If the lord can reduce expenditures and lessen desires, there will be nothing he lacks. Crossing the river and floating upon the sea without seeing its shores is a metaphor for cutting off passions and desires to a great distance. If the lord has no desires, each will return to guard their own place. "From here, you will be far" means to transcend and stand alone above the myriad things. "He who possesses others" means to hold them as one’s private possession. "He who is seen as possessing by others" means to be employed by them. To hold all under heaven and entrust it to the hundred officials is not to possess others; to rely on the people and employ things without being enslaved by them is not to be seen as possessing by others. If one wishes to be utterly free of attachment to the state, then though the world changes, one’s emptiness of self to avoid harm remains the same.

Lü’s commentary: To take the state of Lu as one’s skin is the source of distress, for one cannot forget the state. If the form is not discarded, the state becomes a burden; restraining the form is how one sheds the skin. If the heart is not pure, desires become its stain; washing the heart is how one removes desires. To depart from the human and enter the celestial is to wander in the wilds where none dwell, to establish the state of virtue, and thus to establish the Way. Its people are simple and desire little, not because they lack culture. Acting without storing, things arrive and supply their needs, giving without seeking repayment, being benevolent without considering it a favor. Not knowing where duty leads, they do not value comings and goings. Not knowing where ritual tends, they do not observe its forms. Wandering recklessly and treading the great path, they find joy in life and rest in death, for beginning and end do not depart from them. If one establishes a state as a state in this way, the reason one cannot wander is merely that the state and customs entangle them. Abandoning the state and forsaking customs, walking alongside the Way, one arrives without effort. The Way is near and level, yet people regard it as distant and perilous because their posture is rigid and unyielding, their abode lingering and unmoving. If one makes no rigid posture and no lingering abode their chariot, and minimal expenditure and few desires their provisions, what hindrance could prevent arrival? Not seeing its shores, wandering in boundlessness—those who see one off turn back from the shore, for those constrained by emptiness and fearful of its depths dare not proceed. From here, the lord stands alone without peer, and none can follow. If one wanders thus, one neither possesses others nor is seen as possessing by them. Yao’s being Yao was only like this.

The Great Vastness and the State of Established Virtue are what the previous chapter called the ancestor of the myriad things and the homeland of the Way and virtue. Next, it discusses the empty boat striking the vessel without provoking anger: those who ride upon the Way and virtue and float through the world are likewise in this state.

Yi Du’s commentary: Nanyue is a bright land; the State of Established Virtue is the realm of the sage. Being simple and desiring little is good for nurturing the heart. Acting without storing, giving without seeking repayment—this is great transformation. Not knowing where duty leads is true duty; not knowing where ritual tends is perfect ritual. These three are inwardly attained, so one wanders recklessly, treading the great path, at ease in life and at ease in death. To hollow out the form and discard the heart, to wander in the wilds where none dwell, is to make one’s spirit and virtue enter and unite with heaven. To leave the state and abandon customs, walking alongside the Way in the State of Established Virtue, is to make the Way manifest and unite with humanity. The Lord of Lu truly spoke of sending them to Nanyue, worrying that the Way was distant and perilous, not knowing that the State of Established Virtue is reached only by preserving the spirit and forgetting the form, without movement. The Lord of Lu also feared the Way was distant and without provisions, all because he could not forget things and took words and circumstances literally. Shi Nanzi wished him to seek within his own nature, to reduce expenditures to conserve his spirit, to lessen desires to nurture his heart, so that even without provisions, he would be self-sufficient. The river is a metaphor for virtue; the sea, for the Way. Not seeing its shores is to turn away from circumstances; not knowing its bounds is to adapt to change. Thus, those who see one off all turn back from circumstances, for those who reach the Way surpass what the mediocre can attain.

The noble possess others; the favored are seen as possessing by others. Yao did not possess others, so he could treat nobility as entrusted; he was not seen as possessing by others, so he could treat favor as beneath him. Thus, he was without burden and without trouble. This is why the Lord of Lu was to shed his burdens, forget his troubles, and wander with the Way in the land of Great Vastness. The empty boat is a metaphor for being without mind, so it strikes things without anger; if there is a person aboard, there is a mind attached to things, and things constrain them. If one can be without mind in dealing with things, who could harm them?

Bi Xu’s commentary: Severing the form removes the cultured skin; cleansing the heart eliminates cravings. Having thus governed oneself, one wanders in the wilds where none dwell, abandoning this esteem for worthies and taking up that establishment of virtue—this is the State of Established Virtue. Being foolish, they have little selfishness; being simple, they have few desires. Knowing where duty leads, they store; knowing where ritual tends, they repay. Without recklessness, how could one wander beyond the world? Without reckless action, how could one tread the great path? Being at ease in life and at rest in death, beginning and end do not depart from them.

Life may be joyful, death may be buried—beginning and end abide without parting.

May you, my lord, cast off its residual threads and walk alongside the subtle and wondrous. Yet you fear having no boat or carriage, unable to attain suspended liberation; you further fear the Way is distant and without provisions, the climbing vines not yet severed. With few expenditures and scant desires, one is self-sufficient without provisions—dwelling like the quail, eating like the grub. Crossing rivers and floating on seas, gazing without seeing shores, the dust of the kitchen finds no purchase. Turning back from the shore speaks of those whose strength is small and do not advance. From this point, my lord, you are far indeed—sight and hearing cannot reach you.

Yao was not some other person; he forgot the Fen River. Not seeing others as others, he went about his days unaware. I forget others, and thus have no burdens; others forget me, and thus have no sorrows. Therefore, I wander alone with the Dao in the State of Great Vastness. The State of Great Vastness refers to creation itself.

The empty boat striking another boat illustrates encountering things without mind. Before, one was not angered—there was no other person. Now, one is angered—seeing others as others. If one is not angered by an empty boat, it is clear that things do no harm to an empty self.

Yongzhai said: "To be burdened by one’s own skin speaks of how having a name in the world can summon disaster." Earlier, it spoke of the wilds where none dwell—this is the beginning of no-thing. Here, it again speaks of the State of Established Virtue. Considering this passage, those today who venerate the Pure Land trace their source to this. In the Warring States period, the southern lands of Yue were not yet connected, and the Central Plains used this to illustrate a point—originally without other meaning. Tilling the land for one’s own food without private hoarding, without the names of ritual and duty, thus having nowhere to go, nowhere to tend, acting recklessly from the heart—all accords with the great Dao. With the heart of one who admires the Dao, they encourage one another to reach this land.

Without form, one does not possess the body; without lingering, one does not possess the state. Thus, one may proceed. Crossing rivers and floating on seas, reaching where there is no end—this is merely the phrase "wandering without end." Those who see you off all turn back from the shore. From this point, my lord, you are far indeed. This speaks of those who study the Dao: once awakened, what once aided their awakening—like those who see you off—when the boat reaches the sea, the shore has already turned back. It is like seeing swordplay and becoming skilled in calligraphy: at first, the sword aids understanding, but once understood, the sword becomes the one who sees you off. Reading books is also a means of seeing one off.

The State of Great Vastness is the wilds where none dwell, the State of Established Virtue. The empty boat striking another without anger—this is the finest metaphor. Foxes and leopards, though they hide in seclusion, still cannot escape calamity—it is their skin that brings disaster. Now, the lord of Lu’s position is no different from the cultured skin that invites misfortune. If one can truly restrain the form, the outer skin will naturally fall away; if one cleanses the heart, inner desires will naturally be eliminated. Rising above and far from the俗, one wanders in the wilds where none dwell. Fearing the lord of Lu might find this too vague and groundless, it further sets forth the State of Established Virtue to entice him.

To act without knowing how to store is to be content with what is present. To give without seeking repayment is to bestow without expecting gratitude. How then could one know where duty and ritual tend? Thus, one acts freely without departing from the great Dao. "May be joyful, may be buried" speaks of being at ease in life and at rest in death. Abandoning the state and forsaking the俗 severs one’s entanglements. Walking alongside the Dao, one returns to non-action. Such a one may reach the State of Established Virtue.

The lord of Lu has not yet awakened and further worries that the Way is distant and without boat or carriage. It is told to him: if only you do not exalt yourself as a lord, do not cling to this state’s position, this itself is your carriage—then you may proceed. He also fears the remote and secluded place has no neighbors, no provisions to reach it. Thus, all who cling to things and are mired in being fear falling into emptiness, their breath ever like this. It is further told to him: with few expenditures and scant desires, one is self-sufficient without provisions. May you, my lord, float upon the sea of the Dao and virtue without shores or end.

Those who see you off are like titles, positions, and desires—those who have long followed and become familiar. Once you abandon them and wander without end, those who once followed now gaze at the shore and cannot advance, thus growing ever more distant from you. To see others as others, to perceive others as others—all cannot escape sorrow and burden. Only by being like Yao, vast and nameless, can one avoid such entanglements. May you, my lord, cast off burdens and eliminate sorrows, wandering alone with the Dao in the State of Great Vastness.

"Vastness" is none other than nothingness. From the wilds where none dwell, one reaches the State of Established Virtue. In Great Vastness, even virtue is forgotten—this is the "land of nothing whatsoever" spoken of in the *Free and Easy Wandering*. The empty boat striking another has been fully explained earlier.

There is no need to suddenly depart from one’s dwelling to avoid entanglements. The old interpretation took "居" as part of the previous phrase, and many commentaries followed. Here, it is determined that "离" concludes the phrase, with "居" belonging to the following text.

*Collected Explications of the Ocean of Meanings of the True Scripture of the Southern Florescence*, Scroll Sixty, concludes.

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu, on *"The Mountain Trees"* (Chapter Two)

When Beigong She levied taxes for Duke Ling of Wei to cast a bell, he erected an altar beyond the outer gate of the capital. In three months, the upper and lower chimes were suspended.

Prince Qingji saw this and asked, "What technique have you employed?"

She replied, "In the space of unity, I dared not impose any artifice."

I have heard that once carving and polishing are done, one returns to simplicity. Pity the unknowing; doubt lingers in their hesitation. Gathered in boundless obscurity, they send off the departing and welcome the arriving. Let those who come not be barred; let those who go not be detained. Follow their forcefulness; adapt to their crookedness; rely on their self-exhaustion. Thus, morning and evening, taxes are levied without the slightest harm—how much more so for those on the great thoroughfare!

**Guo’s Commentary:**
Trembling, he guarded unity, daring not to falsely impose anything to complicate matters. He restored their original nature, allowing them to remain in pure simplicity. Without aim, without delight, he let them come and go freely. Yielding to the multitude, unbound by attachment, he acted as they could not but act. Thus, no harm was done; serene and ungrasping, he employed the world’s self-will—this is the path of great passage. Therefore, though he planned and labored, the work was completed without haste.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
If any extraneous artifice were interposed, it would no longer be the One. Carving and polishing return to simplicity—discarding ornament to pursue substance. *Tong*, unknowing, unaware of who or what. *Tang*, hesitant and doubtful, not daring to rush. Sending off the departing and welcoming the arriving, neither barring nor detaining; forcefulness unchecked, crookedness unobstructed, all arising from their inevitability. Thus, morning and evening, taxes were levied without the slightest harm, for he imposed nothing in the space of unity. How much more does this apply to the great thoroughfares of the world’s principles? This is how Pao Ding moved his blade through the spaces and found room to spare.

**Yi Du’s Commentary:**
The bell is hollow within and responsive—an analogy for the human heart. Levying taxes to cast bells is likened to nurturing the spirit to cultivate the mind. Only after consecrating the altar and offering the bell may it be used, just as the substance of the mind must be perfected before its function can be realized. Three months mark the minor completion of Heaven’s Way. The suspension of upper and lower bells fulfills both substance and function.

When Prince Qing Ji questioned the interposition of extraneous artifice, the answer was to embrace the One as function, daring no imposition. *Fu pu* ("returning to simplicity") is an analogy for recovering one’s nature. *Wu shi dai yi* ("unknowing, hesitant, doubtful")—what thought, what deliberation? Neither barring nor detaining what comes and goes, each follows its own course. Yielding to the forceful is softness to hardness; following the crooked is not forcing compliance. Allowing things to reach their natural end ensures they do not reach exhaustion. Thus, taxes were levied without the slightest harm, for all remains within the bounds of inherent nature—unharmed and self-sufficient.

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:**
When the mind is single-mindedly devoted to the task, how dare one impose recklessly? Carving and polishing return to simplicity—its system is pure and ancient. *Tang hu dai yi* ("hesitant and doubtful")—unrestrained and without retreat. Diligently and sincerely welcoming and sending off without grasping or seizing, following resistance, allowing attachment, letting things reach their natural end—this is not coercion. Taxes were levied without harm because the people were content, and how much more does this apply to those who hold the great Dao?

**Yongzhai’s Note:**
Following the principles of nature, pure and unadulterated, is why "no imposition is dared in the space of unity." Carving and polishing return to simplicity—shedding sharp edges to return to nature, unknowing and appearing hesitant or doubtful, free of contrivance. Neither barring nor detaining, without grasping or seizing. Forcefulness is non-compliance; crookedness is compliance. All are followed and heeded, each reaching its own end, whether compliant or contrary. None are sought, yet all arrive, thus no harm befalls even a hair. The "great thoroughfare" refers to what can be traversed with ease—no contrivance is needed to engage with it.

Bells and chimes are instruments of Heaven, attuned to the pitch standards and regulating yin and yang—essential for the state. Yet when taxes are levied on the people to cast them, their completion should be difficult. How then were they finished in three months? The upper and lower suspensions—twelve in all, arranged in ranks—are the so-called *bianzhong*. Marveling at their swift completion, the question arose: what artifice was employed to achieve this? The answer: only the unwavering adherence to purity, daring no imposition.

What is carved and polished begins with effort; returning to simplicity ends in effortlessness. Thus, one reaches a state of unknowing, appearing hesitant and doubtful. *Cui hu mang hu* ("gathered yet scattered")—sending off the departing and welcoming the arriving, like midges passing before one’s eyes. Do not bar what comes, for it follows its own crooked path; do not detain what goes, for it yields to force. Allowing each to reach its natural end, exhausting its own nature, I can halt this, and the upper and lower suspensions remain undisturbed and distinct. How much more so for one who embodies the great Dao?

This is a humble expression. It speaks of engaging with things through the Dao—nowhere is there not ease. Clinging to things obstructs the Dao—nowhere is there not entanglement. Levying taxes to accomplish tasks is unavoidable for later rulers. Yet if the Dao resides within, tasks are completed without harming the people. What is this Dao? Simply guarding the One and returning to simplicity.

When Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, he went seven days without cooked food. Taigong Ren visited and asked, "Are you near death?" "Yes," he replied. "Do you resent death?" "Yes." Taigong Ren said, "I once spoke of the way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called *yixi*. As a bird, it is scattered and disorderly, seemingly incapable. It flies only when led, perches only when pressed, never daring to advance first or retreat last. It does not dare to eat before others, always taking the leftovers. Thus, its ranks are never disrupted, and outsiders never harm it—this is how it avoids disaster. The tallest trees are felled first; the sweetest wells run dry. Are you, perhaps, one who adorns knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivates the self to expose filth, shining brightly like one who carries the sun and moon? That is why you cannot escape harm."

"I once heard from a man of great completion: 'Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit; those who fill their achievements are undone; those who perfect their names are diminished. Who can relinquish merit and fame to return to the common people? The Dao flows yet is not manifest; dwelling in attainment yet not claiming residence. Pure and constant, one seems mad. Shedding edges and discarding influence, not seeking merit or fame—thus, one bears no blame from others, and others bear none from them. The perfected do not strive—why do you delight in this?'"

Confucius said, "Excellent!" He parted from his companions, dismissed his disciples, and fled to the great marsh. Clad in coarse robes, eating acorns and chestnuts, he entered the beasts without disturbing the herd, entered the birds without disrupting their flight. Birds and beasts did not shun him—how much less would people?

**Guo’s Commentary:**
Harm arises from employing knowledge in restless striving. The felling of trees and the drying of wells are harms of exhausting talent. Discerning minor differences sets one apart from the crowd; blending into great sameness leaves no singularity in the world.

Thus, what shines brightly is but the echo of the profound obscurity. To entrust words to leave traces, to rely on Chen and Cai to convey intent—those who cling to merit and fame as their own achievement have never preserved their wholeness. Merit arises from the collective, so it is returned to them. The Dao flows dimly yet moves of itself; they all dwell content in this conduct, not occupying it only after fame has come. Acting without intent, merit is accomplished by others—thus, influence does not reside in me, and fame and traces all depart.

Following their nature and yielding to others, each bears its own responsibility; their accountability is serene and untroubled, without attachment—this is the perfected person. Renouncing companions, dismissing disciples, they cast aside the world’s attachments, like plants and trees without intent. Thus, birds and beasts feel no fear, further entrusting words to fully extend trust in things, leaving no ground for harm.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
Though tangled and erratic, they remain unconfused amid disorder, seeming incapable yet not truly so. Taking flight with aid, roosting under duress—they hesitate, compelled in movement and stillness. Their tracks dare not lead, nor do they lag behind; they emerge without display, withdraw without concealment. They do not taste food first, yet take up its remnants, dwelling in a place of non-contention. Unshunned in ranks, beyond human harm, they accord with the human Dao.

Knowing that merit and fame, once achieved, must suffer loss, they relinquish them to return to the multitude—this is the conduct of the greatly accomplished. The Dao flows unseen; in stillness, none perceive its work. Acting without seeking recognition, none hear their name. "Attainment" is virtue. "Pure and constant" resembles madness—reckless and wayward. Not pursuing merit or fame, they return to the multitude, which is how those with the Dao can offer their surplus to the world.

The hardship of Chen and Cai was endured not because it was insufficient, but because it was unavoidable. Those who study Confucius, if unaware of the unshunned ranks or the approachability of birds and beasts, will scarcely avoid being burdened by merit and fame, walking as if bearing the sun and moon.

**Yi Du’s Commentary:**
The greatly accomplished, like Laozi, relinquish merit and return fame to the multitude—this is how they remain unobstructed and unharmed. The Dao flows through the world without revealing its traces; virtue acts without announcing its name. Unmixed and unchanged, without intent like madness, they bear no blame from others, nor do others blame them—this is the Way of the perfected. The perfected do not desire fame among people—why do you delight in fame?

Thus, the Master renounced companions, dismissed disciples, and fled to the great marsh. Clad in coarse robes, eating acorns and chestnuts, he abandoned the world’s attachments to seek principles beyond things. Birds and beasts grew gentle toward him—how much more so people!

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:**
The bird *yidai* is indolent, embodying a mind free from scheming. Taking flight with aid, eating remnants—this speaks of profound harm-avoidance. Now, Confucius adorned knowledge to compile the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, cultivated himself to establish the *Rites* and *Music*, shining like the sun and moon, revered by the multitude. Yet like straight trees and sweet wells, they are the first to be felled and drained. Those who boast of merit and pride themselves on fame will never remain whole. Thus, the spirit-person claims no merit—merit returns to the people; the sage claims no fame—fame returns to their followers. The Dao and qi spread without ostentation; the perfected dwell where their Way is realized, yet the people do not see their traces.

"Pure and constant" resembles madness—heaven’s noble, humanity’s base. Severing the path of sageliness, there is no merit; discarding power and influence, there is no fame. Adorning knowledge to startle the foolish—hence the hardship of Chen and Cai. Thus, Confucius renounced companions, dismissed disciples, and fled to the great marsh, like *yidai* roosting under duress, unshunned in ranks. Birds and beasts felt no aversion—how much less people!

**Fu Zhai’s Note:**
*Yidai* is the swallow. "Roosting under duress" means nesting near humans. "Unshunned" means not excessive. Each relies on human dwellings, so outsiders cannot harm them. Following the Dao, they move in obscurity—hence, "the Dao flows unseen." Dwelling where their will is realized, not exalting themselves through fame—hence, "acting without seeking recognition." "Pure and constant" is singular. Madness appears without intent; not pursuing merit or fame, self and others bear no blame—transforming without a path.

The perfected desire no renown in the world—why do you delight in fame? The final lines echo *Liezi*’s "eating pigs as one eats people." The phrases *"the Dao flows unseen"* and *"acting without seeking recognition"* should be read with balanced pauses, their meaning self-evident. Guo’s commentary places the note under "unseen," so later interpreters did not surpass this view. Only Lü and Yi Du take "dwelling" and "acting" as the phrases’ core, for "attainment" aligns with virtue, and "name" with fame—harmonizing with the preceding text. The Dao and virtue flow everywhere without self-display, merely avoiding ostentation to prevent exhaustion.

"Pure and constant" resembles madness, free from mutual blame—thus, entering beasts without disturbing the herd, entering birds without disrupting their flight. This is the effect of Confucius embracing the words of the greatly accomplished, purifying his mind and concealing his depths. Hence, it is recorded for later generations as a model and warning.

Confucius asked Zisang Yu: "I was twice exiled from Lu, had my tree felled in Song, was stripped of influence in Wei, was destitute in Shang and Zhou, and besieged between Chen and Cai. I have suffered these many hardships—my close friends grow more distant, my disciples and followers scatter. What is the reason?"

Zisang Yu replied: "Have you not heard of the man of Jia’s flight? Lin Hui abandoned a jade worth a thousand gold pieces, carrying his infant son as he fled. Someone asked, ‘Was it for its value in cloth?'"

"The value of an infant in cloth is meager—was it for its encumbrance? The encumbrances of an infant are many. Yet Lin Hui abandoned a jade worth a thousand gold pieces to carry his infant son in flight—why?"

Lin Hui replied: "That was bound by profit, this by Heaven’s bond. Those bound by profit, when pressed by poverty, calamity, or harm, abandon one another; those bound by Heaven’s bond, when pressed by poverty, calamity, or harm, gather closer. The distance between gathering and abandoning is vast indeed!

Moreover, the friendship of the noble is as bland as water, while the friendship of the petty is as sweet as sweet wine. The noble grow closer in blandness, the petty grow estranged in sweetness. Those who unite without cause will part without cause."

Confucius said: "I respectfully receive your instruction." He then walked slowly, wandering freely as he returned, abandoned learning, and discarded his books. His disciples no longer crowded before him, yet his affection for them grew ever deeper.

Another day, Zisang Yu said: "When Shun was about to die, he addressed Yu with true sincerity: ‘Be vigilant! In form, nothing surpasses compliance; in feeling, nothing surpasses spontaneity. Compliance avoids separation, spontaneity avoids toil. Avoiding separation and toil, one does not seek adornment to sustain form; not seeking adornment to sustain form, one fundamentally needs nothing external.’"

Guo’s commentary: The friendship of the noble is bland because it lacks profit, yet close because the Dao aligns. The friendship of the petty is sweet because it feigns profit, yet profit cannot endure, so it breaks. Those who unite without cause are bound by Heaven; if union does not arise from cause, cause cannot sunder it. Those who unite for cause will part for cause. His affection grew deeper because he shed adornment and embraced simplicity. Following form and yielding to feeling, one does not distort them with profit. Form, unburdened by pretense, remains whole; feeling, unforced, remains at ease. Proceeding with unadorned directness, one is ever sufficient.

Lü’s commentary: Those who study Confucius yet remain unaware of what is called Heaven’s bond, who make learning and books their sole pursuit, will find their ties to the world merely human bonds. In form, nothing surpasses compliance—compliance avoids separation and achieves union. In feeling, nothing surpasses spontaneity—spontaneity avoids toil and attains ease. Avoiding separation and toil, one relies on the natural integrity of one’s essence, for one’s nature is already sufficient. Why seek adornment to sustain form? Not seeking adornment to sustain form, one no longer depends on externals. This is the ultimate expression of abandoning learning and discarding books.

Yi Du’s commentary: Those who unite through power will part when power wanes; those who unite through profit will scatter when profit vanishes. Only father and son, brothers—these are Heaven’s bonds. The way of their closeness is most evident in times of poverty, calamity, or harm. Thus, the Grand Historian said, ‘In sickness and pain, one never fails to call for father and mother.’ The *Book of Songs* says: ‘In death and mourning, brothers are deeply cherished.’ Hence, in the fall of the state of Jia, Lin Hui did not value the thousand-gold jade for its profit but cherished his infant son out of Heaven’s natural bond. Their union arose from no cause, so their parting also arises from no cause. The noble unite through the Dao, so their bond is bland; the petty unite through profit, so their bond is sweet. The noble’s bond through the Dao and Heaven’s bond share the same essence.

After Confucius endured hardship, his friends and disciples scattered because their union had arisen from cause, and thus they parted from cause. When Shun was about to die, he commanded Yu with his true Dao: ‘In form, nothing surpasses compliance—do not let the mind manipulate form. In feeling, nothing surpasses spontaneity—do not let externals disturb feeling. Compliance in form avoids separation; spontaneity in feeling avoids toil. Thus, one returns to simplicity without adornment and finds sufficiency without externals.’

Bi Xu’s commentary: Heaven’s bond is bland yet close; profit’s bond is sweet yet breaks. Union without cause brings closeness; union with cause brings estrangement. Confucius abandoned learning and discarded books, and his disciples grew closer—he shed profit’s bond and retained Heaven’s bond. When Shun was about to die, he enlightened Yu with his true Dao, saying: ‘Form belongs to the external—follow things and comply with them. Feeling belongs to the internal—yield to it and guide it. Compliance with things brings union; yielding to feeling brings ease. Being both united and at ease, why seek adornment to sustain form? One fundamentally needs no external attachment.’"

"External things" refer to close associates, disciples, and friends.

Yongzhai notes: *Leng* (冷) is pronounced *líng*, meaning "to enlighten"; it is to instruct with the true Dao. *Lǜ* (绿) means to follow its natural course. *Shuài* (率) means to comply with its natural tendencies. "Not departing" (不离) means to unite with the Dao. *Xíng* (形) refers to the self. *Wén* (文) refers to things external to the body. One does not rely on external things to sustain the self. *Dài* (待) is like hosting a guest—one does not adorn the self with external embellishments, thus requiring nothing from external things; this is the meaning of "not relying" and "not depending."

Heaven’s bond gathers naturally, uniting without cause; profit’s bond draws near through contrivance, uniting with cause. Comparing the Master’s disciples to Lin Hui’s infant child makes clear the distinction between having cause and having none. Bland closeness and sweet estrangement further illustrate the ways of the world—this is the general principle by which bonds are formed or broken.

Once the Master awakened, he returned and abandoned learning, reaching the state of non-action; he discarded books to delve into their underlying principles. His disciples, free from bows and formalities, forgot all before him, and their affection grew deeper—shedding adornment and embracing authenticity were all Heaven’s bond. Why should only father and son be considered the closest of kin?

When form follows its natural course without departing, the self is ever preserved. When feeling complies with its nature without toil, one’s nature remains at ease. This is the attainment of the true self—what need is there for ritual and embellishment? What reliance is there on external things?

Zhuangzi wore coarse cloth patched with hemp, and his shoes were bound with straps as he passed by King Wei. The king said, "Why does the Master appear so weary?"

Zhuangzi replied, "It is poverty, not weariness. A scholar who possesses the Dao and virtue yet cannot put them into practice—that is weariness. Worn clothes and threadbare shoes are poverty, not weariness. This is what is called not meeting with the times.

"Has Your Majesty never seen a gibbon? When it dwells among catalpa, camphor, and nanmu trees, it grasps the vines and swings through the branches, reigning as king among them—even Yi or Peng Meng could not take aim at it. Yet when it finds itself among brambles, thorns, and wild jujubes, it moves cautiously, glancing about in fear, trembling with dread. This is not because its sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened or lost their suppleness, but because its circumstances are unfavorable, and it cannot fully display its abilities.

"Now, dwelling among benighted rulers and chaotic ministers, how can one avoid weariness? This is like Bi Gan, whose heart was carved out—proof indeed!"

**Guo’s Commentary:** When one meets with the times and finds the right place, one can stretch forth one’s limbs freely; even the finest archers of old could do no harm. But when circumstances are unfavorable and one forces action, one invites execution.

**Lü’s Commentary:** Though Zhuangzi spoke so boldly, he was not harmed—this is evidence of emptying oneself to wander through the world.

**Yi Du’s Commentary:** *Da* (大) means coarse. *Xi* (席) refers to the straps of the shoes. His shoes were worn out, so he bound them with straps.

King Wei sighed at Zhuangzi’s weariness, but Zhuangzi replied that it was poverty, not weariness, and then used the gibbon as a metaphor for himself. Dwelling among catalpa and nanmu is like a gentleman meeting with the times; dwelling among brambles and thorns is like encountering a benighted ruler and chaotic ministers—even if one wishes to avoid weariness, it is impossible. If one insists on speaking frankly and practicing the Dao, one will meet the same fate as Bi Gan, whose heart was carved out—clear proof indeed.

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:** To act without regard for others is weariness; to remain poor despite not meeting with the times is poverty. When a gibbon is in the trees, if it finds a favorable position, it reigns as king; if it finds itself in difficulty, it moves with caution. For a person in a benighted and chaotic age to seek to display their talents is to invite disaster.

**Yongzhai’s Commentary:** *Lan* (揽) means to grasp. *Man* (蔓) means to entwine. The phrase "not supple" is followed by "suddenly stiffened," which vividly captures the gibbon’s state. The closing words, "proof indeed," are also striking. One who abandons profit and rank to preserve their resolve is poor; one who has nothing to preserve and whose qi falters day by day is weary. Poverty is the scholar’s constant state; weariness is the scholar’s ruin. Thus, in a single word, *Nanhua* must correct its meaning—this is how it seeks to convey the truth. The gibbon metaphor—how could it be Zhuangzi’s own desire? It merely describes the difference between catalpa and brambles to illustrate not meeting with the times. Observing Zhuangzi’s response, one can see how firmly he upheld his resolve!

Alas! In what age have scholars who embraced the Dao and failed to find an appreciative audience not encountered a King Wei? Yet if one’s heart is broad and one’s body at ease, one can overcome such things—what poverty or weariness could there be?

Confucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Leaning against a withered tree, he struck its branches and sang the airs of the *Sen* clan. Though the rhythm was unmeasured and the notes lacked proper pitch, the sound of the wood and the human voice blended harmoniously, resonating in the hearts of all who heard. Yan Hui stood with folded hands, turning his gaze to observe.

Fearing that Yan Hui might overestimate him and become grandiose, or pity him and grow sorrowful, Confucius said, "Hui, it is easy not to accept harm from Heaven, but difficult not to accept benefit from others. There is no beginning that is not an end—humanity and Heaven are one. Who, then, is the singer of this song today?"

Yan Hui said, "May I ask why it is easy not to accept harm from Heaven?"

Confucius replied, "Hunger, thirst, cold, heat, and the inability to move freely are the workings of Heaven and Earth, the outflow of the movement of things. To say one goes along with them is to speak of accompanying their passing. As a minister, one does not dare to depart from this. If even the way of serving as a minister is like this, how much more so the way of awaiting Heaven’s decree!"

"What do you mean by it being difficult not to accept benefit from others?"

Confucius said, "When one first gains influence in all four directions, titles and emoluments arrive without end, and the things that benefit others are not one’s own—my fate lies beyond me. The gentleman does not steal, the worthy do not pilfer. If I were to take such things, what would I be? Thus it is said, no bird is wiser than the quail. Where its eyes cannot properly rest, it does not linger to look. Though the fruit falls before it, it abandons it and flees. It fears humans and yet nests among them—such is the preservation of the altars of state.

"What do you mean by there being no beginning that is not an end?"

Confucius said, "Transforming the myriad things without knowing who succeeds whom—how can one know the end? How can one know the beginning? One simply awaits it with correctness, that is all."

"What does it mean for humans and Heaven to be one?"

Confucius said, "Where there is humanity, there is Heaven; where there is Heaven, there is also Heaven. That humans cannot possess Heaven is their nature. The sage, serene and embodied, flows with transformation and comes to rest."

Guo's commentary: When Heaven’s diminishment arrives, only by accepting it does one find ease. Yet the advent of things cannot be forbidden. What is now the beginning was yesterday’s end—thus what is called a beginning is already an end. To speak of endless transformation is to speak of spontaneity. If one follows spontaneity, then even the singer is not oneself. The movements of Heaven and Earth cannot be escaped; to flow with them is to be without knowledge or awareness, to follow the patterns of the Lord-on-High. Wherever one is, there is peace; one does not take diminishment as diminishment. Thus one awaits Heaven without suffering its diminishment. Resonance and response extend in all directions—this is how one may govern the lofty and great. What benefits oneself is not sought and taken; in human life, there is also the mandate of engaging with things, not merely the form and substance of clay and stone. Thieves and pilferers take for themselves; the gentleman’s attainment of titles and emoluments is not a private taking but simply a receiving. Like the quail that fears humans yet enters their dwellings, this is why it is called wise. How much more so the perfected person, who merges obscurely with the world—thus they join together to preserve the altars of state. This is why not receiving benefit from others is so difficult. Day and night succeed one another without end; one simply awaits it with correctness, without harboring anything in the heart.

"Whenever we speak of Heaven, we clarify that it does not act but is spontaneous—how could humans possess this spontaneity? Thus it is called nature. Therefore, the sage is serene and without pride, embodying transformation as it comes."

Lü's commentary: The wind of the Biao clan is like the ode of the Kan clan. The sound of wood, the sound of humans—when they resonate fittingly with the human heart, then the heart too is like withered wood and withered branches. If one has no self and expands from this, then one creates greatness; if one loves the self, then one creates sorrow. Not receiving Heaven’s diminishment is easy; not receiving benefit from others is difficult. Now there is only Heaven’s diminishment—why expand the self to create greatness? With no beginning that is not an end, one simply awaits it. Humans and Heaven are one—serene and embodied, one flows with transformation. Why love the self to create sorrow? Knowing the singer of today, one knows how to be a beginning; that which makes an end for Heaven and humans lies entirely in this.

The movements of Heaven and Earth cannot be halted by humans; the outpouring of the turning of things cannot be closed off by humans. Not receiving Heaven’s diminishment, one flows with it, not daring to regard it as diminishment and flee. Even the way of the minister does not dare to flee—how much less that by which one awaits Heaven? This is why not receiving Heaven’s diminishment is easy. When titles and emoluments arrive together, the mandate lies beyond oneself. If one were to accept what benefits things as one’s own benefit, how would this differ from theft? The gentleman, amidst the arrival of all four directions, regards what benefits things as not one’s own. "My mandate lies beyond me"—thus one does not dare to receive and take it. Like the quail that fears humans yet enters their dwellings, the world joins together to preserve the altars of state, and one cannot depart from this. This is why not receiving benefit from others is so difficult.

"Transforming the myriad things without knowing who succeeds whom—what succeeds is precisely what does not transform. How then can one know its end or beginning? Where there is humanity, there is Heaven; where there is Heaven, there is only Heaven. That humans cannot possess Heaven is their nature. This is why humanity is Heaven. Knowing it as Heaven, one is serene and embodied, flowing with transformation to the end."

Du's commentary: After seven days without fire and food, one nearly dies. Yet when it comes to the mandate, one accepts it without falling into mortal peril. Singing the wind of the Chen clan, the heart delights in the Dao. With form but no number, one is not enslaved by yin and yang. With sound but no gong or jue notes, one is not enslaved by the five phases. Confucius feared that Yan Hui, upon hearing the song, would expand his own affairs to create great intentions, or upon encountering hardship, would love his own life to create sorrowful emotions. Thus he told him that no beginning is not an end, speaking of endless transformation. Combining Heaven and humans in speech: Who is the singer of today? One does not know why it is so, yet it is so.

Hunger, thirst, cold, heat—the afflictions of yin and yang, when they reach their limit and do not proceed, are also the timing of Heaven. The movements of Heaven and Earth, the outpouring of the turning of things, all originate in yin and yang. Yin and yang to humans are no less than father and mother—thus one flows with them. The minister receives the mandate from the ruler and does not dare to flee—how much less when receiving the mandate from Heaven? "First gaining influence in all four directions" speaks of entering human dwellings, being unobstructed everywhere. When titles and emoluments arrive together, one cultivates the Heavenly title, and the human title follows. The gentleman obtains titles to benefit things—how could they be tied to oneself? "My mandate lies beyond me" means that human benefit comes from beyond; receiving human benefit with utmost impartiality is not stealing to take it. All who cannot fulfill their kind are thieves. "If I were to take such things, what would I be?"—this speaks of receiving human benefit without selfishness. The quail enters human dwellings, and humans love and become familiar with it, so it escapes harm. This illustrates how the sage harmonizes light and merges with the dust, and the world delights in advancing them without tiring.

"Transforming the myriad things" is transformation; "what succeeds" is change. Change and transformation alternate without end—one simply awaits it with correctness. Within humanity there is Heaven; within Heaven there is Heaven. That humans cannot possess Heaven is nature without mandate; that Heaven cannot possess humanity is mandate without nature. The principle of nature and mandate is like yin and yang, which cannot be without each other. Flowing with transformation to the end is to follow the principle of nature and mandate, uniting the transformations of Heaven and humans.

Bi Xu's commentary: Leaning on the armrest and playing the zither, chanting ancient airs—Confucius feared that Yan Hui would expand the self to create greatness or love the self to create sorrow. Thus he told him that encountering hunger, thirst, and extreme hardship without worry is easy, while remaining unmoved by titles, emoluments, power, and profit is difficult.

Without beginning yet without end—where there is this mandate, there is this retribution; what humans create differs not from Heaven’s bestowal.

Now the song’s voice shifts from the norm, yet one knows not why. Drought and desolation, cold and heat, obstruction and impasse—these are Heaven’s diminutions. To ascend and descend with them is easy; to oppose them is difficult. Even the lord’s command cannot be evaded—how much less what awaits from Heaven? Titles and emoluments come for the sake of benefiting others, not for oneself. Mandate resides within; titles and emoluments glorify without—yet these too are mandate. The realm’s public instruments—how could one privately accept them?

The swallow is called wise for its ability to distance itself from harm, choosing its dwelling with advantage and settling without regard for others’ depths. Yet it must nest in human dwellings, for its nest and hollow are there. Confucius, calling himself obstructed by Heaven’s mandate, found it easy to be at peace; titles and emoluments, being human affairs, were difficult to refuse. Yet he endured dangers and hardships without leaving, for his ancestral grave was in Lu. All things have beginning and end—only those who fully realize the essence of nature and mandate transcend them.

Embodied between Heaven and Earth, one is human; constrained by fetters or titles and emoluments, one is Heaven. United with Heaven, prosperity and adversity are no longer human matters. That humans cannot follow Heaven’s principle and act recklessly is also the nature of their nature. Thus the sage, serene and without attachment, follows the transformations wherever they lead—this is the ultimate attainment of mandate.

Yongzhai says: "Expanding the self is to honor the self. Seeking with the intent to honor the self, one’s creations know no bounds; thinking with the intent to cherish the self, one must reach sorrow." Human and Heaven are one—what is within me is all Heaven’s principle. Now the singer is not myself.

To receive no diminution from Heaven is to be poor yet joyful. To receive no augmentation from others is to be rich yet not dissolute. When Heaven diminishes, one cannot but be at peace—thus it is easy. When others augment, one cannot decline—thus it is difficult. Obstruction and stagnation cannot be pushed away; the ebb and flow of things, the coming and going of qi and fate—all are Heaven. Even the lord’s command cannot be defied—how could Heaven’s mandate be defied? This is why receiving no diminution from Heaven is easy.

At the first stirring of intent, the four directions open unimpeded, and no obstacle follows. Titles and emoluments arrive from without, also by mandate’s decree—thus it is said, "My mandate has something external to it." To receive emoluments without merit, the noble person feels shame, regarding them as theft. Yet there are things that cannot be pushed away—this is why receiving no augmentation from others is difficult.

The yiyi (swift) is indolent. Fearing humans yet drawing near to them, it dwells in the sacred grounds of altars and sacrifices, where people naturally revere and preserve it—like the swallow in a human home, where people naturally cherish and tolerate it. To say that those in wealth and honor can be like the yiyi, neither benefiting nor harming others, is to say they would face no reproach. Yet once rich and honored, how can one be without benefit or harm? This is why it is difficult.

Without beginning yet without end—one knows not their limits, but abides within creation, awaiting it alone. Humans are born of Heaven—thus where there are humans, there is Heaven. Heaven too is made by creation—thus where there is Heaven, there is also Heaven. Nature is the nature of Heaven’s mandate, this nature identical to the character for "birth." Human nature is present at birth, all received from Heaven, not granted by humans. Thus the sage abides in it, calmly fulfilling his life alone.

Withered wood, withered branches—all are things without attachment. Singing the airs of the many clans is to lament the present and long for the past. "Expanding the self to create greatness" is to magnify one’s affairs. "Cherishing the self to create sorrow" is to be consumed by grief and melancholy.

When Heaven’s diminution comes, to be at peace is easy; when others’ augmentation arrives, to decline is difficult. Confucius once said it is difficult to be poor without resentment and easy to be rich without arrogance. The *Nanhua* reverses this stance, its meaning especially striking yet not contrary to principle—this is why it surpasses the other masters.

"To be poor without resentment is difficult" refers to the common person; "to receive no diminution from Heaven is easy" speaks to the Dao practitioner. Like Yanzi delighting in his gourd bowl, receiving no diminution from Heaven is easy; like Prince Sou of Wang, ascending the chariot and crying out to Heaven, receiving no augmentation from others is difficult.

When Heaven’s diminution comes, peace lies within me—not taking diminution as diminution—this is why it is easy. When others’ augmentation arrives, it carries authority and cannot be declined—this is why it is difficult. Yet fortune and misfortune intertwine, their forms like cycles—how can one know that Heaven’s diminution is not augmentation? Or that others’ augmentation is not diminution? Thus the enlightened person sees diminution as augmentation, abides in adversity as in ease, and is neither dissolute nor swayed, with life and death unable to take anything from them.

Truly knowing that without beginning there is no end—what diminution can then diminish? The principles of Heaven and humans mutually complete each other. Now the singer is not myself—creation has made it so. All things receive Heaven and Earth’s transformations, no less than a minister obeys the lord’s command. Only those who embrace the Dao within themselves are not subject to its diminutions.

When the four directions arrive together, and mandate lies without, one obtains it by principle, not by theft—thus when others’ augmentation comes, the noble person may at times accept it. The yiyi, fearing humans yet nesting among them, is an analogy for the wisdom of preserving oneself in the world. Its regard for its nest and hollow and refusal to leave are like a person’s duty to the altars of soil and grain, which cannot be abandoned.

Heaven and Earth transform things imperceptibly. Humans should unite with Heaven as Heaven, abiding in time and following transformations, neither titles nor adversity troubling their minds. That humans cannot possess Heaven is to be inferior even to the yiyi and quail. *Yunwu* ("the movement of things")—Bi Xu’s *Jiangnan Ancient Repository Edition* reads *yunhua* ("transformation"), which is superior in meaning. *Ji* ("extreme") should be *zhi* ("obstruction"), as the original text often uses them interchangeably.

Zhuang Zhou wandered within the fence of the carved mound, where he saw an unusual yiyi coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet, its eyes a full inch in diameter. It struck Zhou’s forehead and alighted in the chestnut grove.

Zhuang Zhou said: "What bird is this? Its wings vast yet unable to take flight, its eyes large yet unable to see?" He hitched up his robe, quickened his steps, grasped his sling, and lingered to observe it.

He saw a cicada, just having found fine shade and forgetting its own body. A mantis, seizing the opportunity to conceal itself, struck at the cicada, seeing only gain and forgetting its own form. The strange magpie, following after, coveted the mantis, seeing profit and forgetting its true nature.

Zhuang Zhou suddenly exclaimed: "Alas! Things inherently entangle one another—two kinds summon each other!" He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the gamekeeper pursued and berated him.

Zhuang Zhou returned home and for three months did not step into the courtyard. Lan Ju followed and asked him: "Master, why have you been so withdrawn of late?"

Zhuang Zhou replied: "I guarded my form yet forgot my body. I observed the turbid waters and became lost in the clear abyss. Moreover, I have heard our Master say: 'Enter their customs, follow their customs.' Now I wandered in the carved mound and forgot my own body; the strange magpie struck my forehead. I roamed the chestnut grove and forgot my true nature. The gamekeeper of the chestnut grove took me for a thief—this is why I have not stepped into the courtyard."

Guo’s commentary: The mantis held a leaf to conceal itself from the cicada yet forgot that its form was exposed to the strange magpie. Eyes that can see, wings that can fly—these are the bird’s true nature. Now, seeing profit, it forgot them. Those who pursue gain invariably burden one another. Thus, to desire something is to be desired by it.

*Evaluation* means inquiry. Living among people, the world has its level paths and perils. To impose one’s untroubled form upon this world without measuring what is fitting is to guard the form while losing the body. Seeing another yet remaining unclear, one thereby becomes visible through that other—this nearly inverts the principle of reflection.

"Entering customs and following customs" means not violating their prohibitions. To be taken for a thief and questioned—Zhuangzi extended his equanimity to the world, thus often conveying meaning through indirect speech. He disparaged Confucius, belittled Lao Dan, above reproached the Three Sovereigns, and below lamented his own plight.

Lü’s commentary: Observing the strange magpie’s pursuit of gain and following the desires of the eyes and ears is to guard the form. Not anticipating the gamekeeper’s inquiry, which brought humiliation, is to forget the self. Action that engages with things is turbid water; stillness that profoundly reflects is the clear abyss. The perfected person never loses the clear abyss even for a moment. Yet Zhuangzi spoke thus to clarify that wandering the world with emptiness—like his words to the King of Wei—though sufficient to avoid harm, still requires caution of what others fear, and thus cannot be otherwise.

Yi Du’s annotation: *Fan* means fence. *Gan* means to strike. The cicada found fine shade, its gain being small, so it merely forgot its body. The mantis, intent on seizing the cicada, was increasingly deluded, thus not only forgetting its body but also its form. The strange magpie, determined to profit, was even more deluded, forgetting even the principles of life and nature! The more people are deluded by desires, the more they forget—how can one not be vigilant? Zhuangzi, awakening to this, sighed: "Things inherently entangle one another—two kinds summon each other!" He abandoned his sling and returned to the chestnut grove, where the gamekeeper, suspecting him of stealing chestnuts, pursued and berated him. Realizing the nature of things to be thus, Zhuangzi remained at home for three months without stepping into the courtyard.

Lan Ju, a disciple of Zhuangzi’s gate, asked in puzzlement. Zhuangzi answered: "I guarded my form yet forgot my body, observing the gains sought by the cicada and magpie while I too forgot my own body. I observed the turbid waters and became lost in the clear abyss—seeing another and reflecting back upon oneself. The Master refers to Laozi. 'Entering customs and following customs' embodies the principle of harmonizing one’s light and blending with the dust."

Bi Xu’s annotation: Things entangle one another and forget what should not be forgotten due to mutual attraction. Thus, Zhuangzi cast aside his sling and fled, yet the gamekeeper suspected him of stealing chestnuts. His three months of seclusion were due to the humiliation of the gamekeeper’s inquiry. Guarding his form, he now regretted having forgotten his body, awakening to how external dust had obscured his inner clarity.

The Master refers to Chang Sang Gong, Zhuangzi’s teacher. Knowing the prohibitions of customs keeps one far from misfortune; violating boundaries and transgressing laws invites blame. This alludes to Confucius, who, though navigating the world, could not escape humiliation—fortunate to have narrowly avoided being cooked or punished.

Yongzhai said: Wings vast yet unable to fly, eyes large yet unable to see—this is the state of one who pursues things and becomes self-deluded. The mantis and the magpie, though of different kinds, summon each other, both forgetting form and true nature, entangling one another. "Guarding the form and nurturing life"—I study the art of nurturing life, yet in chasing the magpie, I forgot my own body. This is to be led by desire and drowned in principle.

Turbid water symbolizes human desires; the clear abyss, heavenly principle. "Entering a state and inquiring about its customs"—to mistakenly enter another’s chestnut grove is to violate prohibitions. This shows that in things, whether great or small, those who pursue are all deluded and do not realize it.

*Fan*: Old explanations equate it with the *fan* of a fence, but the sound and meaning both suggest confinement and meanness, unsuitable for wandering. Here, following the character, it is explained as *shan fan* ("mountain fence"). In the *Zeyang* chapter: "In summer, he rests in the mountain fence," referring to dense mountain forests.

"Three months without stepping into the courtyard": The *Yinyi* annotation states that one version reads "three days." Considering the phrase "of late" below, "three days" is more fitting—a minor scribal error.

"Following their customs": The Bi Xu edition reads "following their commands." The Yuan edition likely had *ling* ("commands"), as Guo’s commentary refers to it, aligning with the *Record of Rites*: "Entering a state, inquire about its prohibitions; entering a country, inquire about its customs."

When Yangzi traveled to Song, he lodged at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other ugly. The ugly one was favored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yangzi asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s servant replied: "The beautiful one takes herself as beautiful, but I do not see her beauty. The ugly one takes herself as ugly, but I do not see her ugliness."

Yangzi said: "Disciples, take note: act with worthiness yet abandon the conduct of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be beloved?"

Guo’s annotation: "The Dao of self-regard admits no moment of permissibility."
Lü’s annotation: "Act with worthiness yet abandon the conduct of self-regard—this is why one is beloved wherever one goes."
Yi Duzhu’s annotation: "Arrogance, complacency, and self-aggrandizement are abhorred by both humans and spirits. Humility and self-cultivation are joyfully embraced by all under Heaven. Proceeding thus, who could resist?"
Bixu’s annotation: "The fair one takes pride in her beauty, and so is slighted by others; the plain one humbles herself, and so is favored. Yangzi had his disciples record this affair, that later generations of the worthy might abandon the conduct of self-regard. Moreover, the two concubines—one fair, one plain—reveal the distinction between talent and its absence, though the resemblance is deceptive."
Yongzhai’s remark: "Possessing the virtue of the worthy yet free from the conduct of self-regard, one will be beloved wherever one goes. This passage, like the earlier chapter on the cicada and the magpie, offers intimate instruction for the learner. If one clings to the conduct of self-regard, even the fair will be despised—how much more the plain? If one abandons the conduct of self-regard, even the plain will be loved—how much more the fair? Beauty and plainness lie in form; love and hate lie in the heart; nobility and baseness lie in fate. Form is fixed and unchanging; fate waxes and wanes with time; the heart shifts with things. Thus love and hate are inconstant. But when the other takes beauty or plainness for granted while I remain unaware of either, heart and thing are forgotten, as at the Qi ford. Only then can one transform others! If they can abandon worthiness and I can forget worthiness, this is ‘not exalting worthiness’—the means by which the people are freed from contention and return to self-transformation. No governance is greater than this, and so it concludes the discourse of *The Mountain Tree*. This chapter takes its title from the mountain tree, echoing the meanings of the great *ning* and the *li* shrine—both of which, being useless, lived out their natural span. Juxtaposed with Li, who could not sing and was killed, it shows how Nan Hua’s view of worldly conventions has matured. That a tree survives by its gnarled deformity is a principle of nature; yet the longevity, brevity, success, or failure of things each depends on fate, and what one encounters cannot be reduced to rule—even uselessness may bring fortuitous escape. Talent and its absence are both entanglements in writing; the middle path between them still verges on confusion, for it resembles truth without being truth, and thus remains encumbered. To transcend these three and stand alone, to ride the Dao and virtue in free wandering, to move with things and change with time, to rise above things and their origins without encumbrance, to shed the outer husk and avoid disaster—then the lands of *Jiande* and *Damo* will arrive of themselves, without need of distant seeking! Like the empty boat that strikes another yet provokes no anger, or the levy that spares even a hair, one meets things with an unburdened heart, and things respond in kind. The hardships of Chen and Cai pale beside the wisdom of the magpie; the mantis and the cicada, unaware of the sling and the crossbow, dwell in talent yet remain imperfect, and thus cannot escape encumbrance. Lin Hui abandoned his jade to carry the infant child; Emperor Shun instructed Yu to value kinship over form. Thus one knows to honor Heaven’s bonds without relying on external things! Wearing coarse cloth before the King of Wei, singing to the hollow branch before the gate of Kan—this shows that poverty is not exhaustion, and that accepting Heaven’s reduction brings ease. When others’ gifts arrive, one must have a way to receive them. The conclusion—acting with worthiness yet abandoning the conduct of self-regard—transcends the distinction between talent and its absence, attaining true resemblance. Thus the Perfected One does not shrink from earnest repetition, urging the learner to advance another step beyond the pole’s tip."

By Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin

**Tian Zifang, Chapter One**

Tian Zifang was in attendance upon Marquis Wen of Wei, and repeatedly praised Xi Gong. The Marquis said, "Xi Gong—is he your teacher?" Zifang replied, "No. He is merely a villager from my hometown. He speaks of the Dao with such frequency and aptness that I cannot but praise him." The Marquis said, "Then do you have no teacher?" Zifang said, "I do." The Marquis asked, "Who is your teacher?" Zifang said, "Shu Guoshunzi." The Marquis said, "Then why have you never mentioned him?" Zifang said, "His person is true: in human form yet empty of Heaven, yielding yet preserving the real, pure yet accommodating all things. When things lack the Dao, he rectifies his bearing to awaken them, dissolving their intentions. How could I be worthy to praise him!"

Zifang departed. The Marquis sat in a daze, silent for a long while. Then he summoned his attendant ministers and said to them, "How distant is the gentleman of complete virtue! At first, I thought the words of sagely wisdom and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness were the ultimate. But upon hearing of Zifang’s teacher, my form dissolved and I had no desire to move; my mouth was sealed and I had no desire to speak. What I have studied is but a clod of earth—how the state of Wei has truly become a burden to me!"

**Guo’s Annotation:** To say that Dongguo Shunzi’s appearance is the same as others’ yet he alone follows nature, empty and yielding to things, is to say that he does not lose the real. The pure rest in excessive purity; now, pure yet accommodating all things, he is one with Heaven. By purifying the empty and rectifying the self, the perversity of things naturally dissolves. Thus, he does not sing or move, nor does he speak deliberately—he simply senses his own nearness. A clod of earth is not a true thing; those who know the ultimate responsibility consider human rank a burden.

**Lü’s Annotation:** "His person is true" means he is indeed human in form yet Heaven in essence. The hearts of ordinary people are never, even for a moment, not entangled with things; the true person is empty, yielding yet preserving the real. The purity of ordinary people rests in excessive scrutiny; the true person is pure yet accommodates all things. When things lack the Dao, he rectifies his bearing to awaken them, so that what he imparts does not lie in tedious repetition, and what others reform does not lie in the midst of action. Sagely wisdom and benevolence and righteousness are but words and deeds. As for Zifang’s teacher, he is what is called the Dao and virtue. Seek them in form and they cannot be found—thus, the form dissolves and one has no desire to move. Seek them in the senses and they cannot be found—thus, the mouth is sealed and one has no desire to speak. They are not attainable through study, so one knows that what one has studied is but a clod of earth. How could Wei not be a burden to me!

**Yi Duzhu’s Annotation:** Generally, those who are empty and yield to things often err in having nothing to uphold; those who are pure and reject things often err in having nothing to accommodate. When the world has things lacking the Dao, rectify your bearing to awaken them, so that others take rectitude from you and their perverse intentions naturally dissolve. As *Mencius* says, "Rectify yourself, and things are rectified." At first, the Marquis did not awaken to the Dao, so he took the words of sagely wisdom and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness as the ultimate. Upon hearing of Zifang’s teacher’s virtue and Dao, he suddenly awakened to principle, forgetting form and speech. Only then did he realize that what he had previously studied was but a clod of earth. A clod of earth is like a mere lump of soil. One who knows the Dao still considers his own body a burden—how much more the state of Wei!

**Bixu’s Annotation:** The seven apertures of the red dwelling are human; not manifesting likes and dislikes is Heaven. Empty and yielding, preserving the real, is blending with the俗. Pure yet accommodating all things is uniting with Heaven. Rectifying one’s bearing to awaken things is leading by example. Dissolving others’ intentions is emptying the square inch of the heart. Sagely wisdom and benevolence and righteousness belong to the teaching of names; Zifang’s teacher embodies the Dao and virtue. Realizing that what one has studied is but a clod of earth is distinguishing the real from the false through the true. Knowing that the state of Wei is a burden is the difficulty of forgetting the great thing.

**Yongzhai’s Annotation:** Though human in form, he possesses the natural virtue of Heaven. With an empty heart, he yields to things, never disturbing his heart to preserve the real. Purity easily separates one from things, yet he can accommodate them—this speaks to his greatness. When people act without the Dao, he moves his bearing to make them awaken themselves, dissolving their unworthy hearts. "Form dissolved" means he lost himself. Considering having a state a burden shows he had not yet deeply investigated the Dao of non-action and nature.

**Chu’s Personal Insights:** Names are for manifesting virtue—this is external learning. Internal learning considers them a burden to virtue. Thus, all who study the Dao and are praised by the world have not yet attained perfection. They are not complete in virtue. As for Shu Guoshunzi, even his disciples never praised him—how could the world perceive even a fraction of him?

**Te’s Note:** If the Master were to gain influence in the court, his teaching would be one of no words, his authority one of no punishment. This is nearly the meaning of "the Dao is present at a glance."

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, "When the Master walks, I walk; when the Master hurries, I hurry; when the Master runs, I run. Yet when the Master dashes ahead, leaving all behind, I can only stare in astonishment!" Confucius said, "Hui, what do you mean?" Yan Yuan said, "When the Master walks, I walk; when the Master speaks, I speak. When the Master hurries, I hurry; when the Master debates, I debate. When the Master runs, I run; when the Master speaks of the Dao, I speak of the Dao. But when the Master dashes ahead, leaving all behind, I can only stare in astonishment—because the Master does not speak yet is trusted, does not associate yet is all-embracing, has no implements yet the people are governed before him, and I do not know how this comes to be."

Confucius said, "How can this not be examined! There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and the death of the person is secondary to it. The sun rises in the east and sets in the western extreme—all things follow its pattern. Those with eyes and feet depend on it to succeed. When it rises, they exist; when it sets, they perish. All things are like this: they die by what they depend on, and they live by what they depend on. Once I received my completed form, I do not transform while awaiting its end, but move in accord with things, day and night without cease, yet do not know where it will end."

The vapors congealed to form this shape, yet knowing fate cannot be measured before it—thus I daily pass away.

My whole life I clasped your arm but lost you—how could this not be sorrowful! You likely fixate on what I fixate upon. That has already vanished, yet you seek it as if it still exists—this is like searching for a horse in a marketplace. I wear you so completely I forget you; you wear me so completely you forget me. Yet why should you grieve? Though you forget the old me, there remains something in me that does not forget.

The heart takes death as death, only hastening its own demise. Its swift death arises from sorrow’s self-loss; without sorrow, it would cease. With sorrow, the heart dies—this is the greatest sorrow. All things follow this pattern, all are visible. The eye completes its function of seeing, the foot completes its function of walking. Only by not seeing is it considered lost. Depending on concealment is called death; depending on manifestation is called life—yet in the end, there is no death or life.

What exists cannot transform into nothingness. Once receiving its completed form, transformation continues without end. Moving without intention, its transformations are ever-renewing, not taking death as death. The vapors congealed to form this shape—what more is there to do? Knowing fate is not bound to what came before, but moves with change, it cannot be detained. Even clasping arms in vigil, one cannot make it stop. If one mourns death, this too is cause for mourning—yet why do people never mourn this?

A marketplace is no place to stable a horse—seeking what once was, it cannot be regained. Human life is like a horse passing through the market, never pausing for an instant. The new and old follow one another without joining day or night. You likely see what I see as ever-renewing—thus what was before has already vanished. How can you still possess it?

"Wearing" means dwelling in thought. "Utterly forgotten" describes the swiftness of passing—you depart in an instant, and thinking of you, I feel I cannot keep up. It is the same for all, whether wise or foolish—none can halt this. What does not forget remains: it continues with daily renewal. Though you long for the old me, the new me has already arrived. It has never ceased to be me—how could I rest? Thus I transcend the vulgar and leave the dust behind, merging with all things without obstruction.

Movement—walking, hastening, galloping—can be pursued and overtaken. But when one is not constrained yet trusted, not associated yet all-embracing, without implements yet the people are governed before him—then one does not know how this comes to be. Thus it is like dashing ahead, leaving all dust behind, while Yan Hui gapes in astonishment.

One whose heart has never died does not know death. Only after the heart dies does the death of the person follow—this is the greatest sorrow. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west; all things follow its pattern. Yet only those with eyes and feet depend on it to succeed. When it rises, they exist; when it sets, they perish—yet the sun itself never has existence or perishing. Things depend on it for death and life, yet what they depend on never has death or life.

The reason I do not speak yet am trusted, do not associate yet am all-embracing, have no implements yet the people are governed before me—all comes down to this. If I, having received my completed form, did not transform while awaiting its end, but moved in accord with things day and night without cease, then I would be like all things, depending on something to live. How could I embody what I depend on to the point of not knowing how it is so? Thus I daily pass away—not transforming while awaiting its end—how could this not be sorrowful? This is the greatest sorrow.

You seek where I dash ahead, leaving all dust behind, yet cannot find it. You likely fixate on what I fixate upon, yet do not see what I do not fixate upon. The human heart grasps and lets go, preserves and abandons—what is there to fixate on that can truly be fixed? That has already vanished, yet you seek it as if it still exists—how is this different from searching for a horse in a marketplace? The marketplace is where horses pass through, not where they reside.

I wear you so completely I forget you—thus what is called "I" no longer exists. You wear me to the point of fate, understanding the Dao of day and night, penetrating the principle of life and death. Thus there are those whose form dies but whose heart does not die. The greatest sorrow is the death of the heart—not the death that does not perish. When a person dies, the form transforms but the heart does not.

The sun rises in the east and sets in the west; all things cling to it. All with form depend on yin and yang to succeed. Rising is yang, thus existence; setting is yin, thus perishing. All things depend on something for death and life—none escape this. Only without death and life is there nothing to depend on.

Once receiving its completed form, not transforming while awaiting its end—awaiting its end is having nothing to depend on. This is Confucius’ state of neither life nor death. Day and night without cease, uniting yin and yang as one; moving in accord with things, without intention, following them. Not knowing where it will end, not taking death as death. The vapors congealed to form this shape—not taking life as life.

Daily passing away, moving with change, clasping an arm only to lose it—this speaks of the Creator’s driving of humanity, a hundred years passing in an instant. People know to mourn death, yet do not know this principle is even more sorrowful.

"Fixation" means clarity. A marketplace is where horses pass through, not where they stay. Seeking what once was, it cannot be regained—like hiding a boat in a mountain crevice, only to have it carried away in the dead of night. What is seen is ever-renewing. As for what was before—it has already vanished. How can it still exist?

I wear you so completely I forget you, making you forget me. You wear me so completely you forget me, making me forget you. "Wearing" means dwelling in thought. "Utterly forgotten" describes the swiftness of passing—you depart in an instant, and thinking of you, I feel I cannot keep up. It is the same for all—none can halt this.

What does not forget remains: it continues with daily renewal. Though you long for the old me, the new me has already arrived. It has never ceased to be me—how could I rest? Thus I transcend the vulgar and leave the dust behind, merging with all things without obstruction.

Transcending all dust, this metaphor speaks of the sublime principle’s unparalleled excellence, responding to change without end. Footprints may be hindered, forms may transform—these can be altered and restored. But if the spirit’s abode is not empty, rushing toward death without return—what greater sorrow could there be?

The "death of the heart" refers to the loss of self through rigid attachment. Lian Boyu, at sixty, recognized the errors of his fifty-nine years—his heart remained alive. The sun’s ceaseless rising and setting mirrors the unceasing transformation of all things: without the sun, nothing is seen; without the sun, no path is walked. When the eye grasps the sun’s ever-renewing wonder, sight is never startled; when the foot grasps it, steps never falter—this is called success.

At sunrise, all things become visible; at sunset, all fade into obscurity. All things follow their cycles of flourishing and decline, each with its appointed day of death and birth. Only those who escape these cycles remain unbound. Confucius understood that life and death are fated, thus he neither resisted the workings of creation above nor clung to his allotted span below. He moved in accord with things, and things in turn moved with him, day and night without retreat, his heart unbroken until the end. To have an end is to invite interruption.

The qi of yin and yang steams forth to shape all forms. To measure present affairs by past patterns is to defy the principles of heaven. Therefore, the sage constantly preserves daily renewal: when the appointed time arrives, he departs. Even in the brief span of an arm’s exchange between you and me, the past has already become distant. How could one of resolve not feel a pang of sorrow? This is how I reveal the transformations of the external world—by the time you nearly grasp this, that has already vanished. What is there to discuss?

What in me remains unchanging is beyond your reach, and so you lag behind as if left staring. The wonder of daily renewal is used by the common people every day yet goes unnoticed, for it leaves no trace. Yet you seek it as if it were something tangible—this is like searching for a horse in a marketplace where no horses are kept!

You and I are deeply bound in mutual contemplation, yet this does not mean we should prize the teacher or cherish the disciple. When both teacher and disciple are forgotten, what rest remains for you and me? To forget the old self is to realize the body is not one’s own. What does not forget endures, and the Dao is present in all things.

Yongzhai says: "The death of the heart" is a metaphor for seeing nothing. To live yet see nothing is worse than death—thus, there is no greater sorrow. The sun’s rising and setting, from dawn to dusk, can be counted, but the transformations of things cannot.

All beings with eyes and limbs—those creatures of movement and response—must await the sun before their affairs may proceed. The rise and fall of human affairs are bound to the sun’s rising and setting. All things depend on the Dao, just as human affairs depend on the sun.

Once a person receives form, this Dao resides within the body, never shifting or changing. It moves in response to things without harboring intent, seamless and unbroken—this body is nothing but harmony and compliance. Though one may know that all events are fated, one does not use fate as a measure.

The sun’s journey is to go forth with it. To stand side by side, arms linked, is to share its passage. Throughout my life, I have walked with you, yet you have not grasped this Dao. You see only what I show you, unaware that there is also what cannot be seen. The Dao must reach nothingness before it is complete; you seek it through being, and thus you never see its fullness.

A *tang* is a roofless shelter. As the *Book of Songs* says, “Within the central hall, there is lament.” A *tangsi* is like today’s roadside pavilion—seeking a horse in a *tangsi* is like carving a mark on a boat to find a dropped sword.

To be utterly unknowable is called “profound forgetting.” *Fu* means to act. What I do with you is utterly unknowable; what you do with me must also be utterly unknowable. This matter cannot be spoken between us—it is only when words are forgotten that it is complete. Though you have not yet reached this, you may still rest.

You already know of the one who gallops beyond the dust, yet one awakening is not enough. When you can forget your old self, though what you see may differ from now, what does not forget still remains. To see it fully is to reach the point of nothingness—yet even then, it is still a principle bound by time.

Confucius galloped beyond the dust while Yan Hui could only gaze after him in awe, as Yang Xiong said: “Yan struggled to match Confucius’s towering brilliance.” The heart of the sage is still as deep water; when things arise, it illuminates them, responding in hidden accord—this is called “being spring to all things,” ceaseless day and night.

But if the heart dies, it becomes withered and cut off from things, mired in stubborn emptiness, sunk in dark stillness, never to revive. Thus, there is no greater sorrow. Once the heart dies and does not revive, the person dies with it.

The sun’s rising and setting illustrate the life and death of things. “Having eyes” should read “having a head”—the *Heaven and Earth* chapter speaks of beings with heads and limbs but no heart or ears, referring to all who walk beneath heaven and tread upon earth. This points to creation: the survival and demise of things depend on creation’s rising and setting, what is called “dependence.”

The sun’s journey is to go forth with transformation. You and I share this life, yet we pass like arms brushing in passing—gone in an instant. How can this not be lamentable? You see only what I show you, glimpsing its traces. Chen Kui has already transformed, yet you seek him as if he still exists—this is like seeking a horse in a *tangsi*.

Yongzhai’s explanation of *tangsi* is apt. It may also have been the name of a marketplace in those days, like the Horse Market or Fan Tower in the capital—though this need not be over-examined.

I have “profoundly forgotten” what I once did with you, meaning all past matters between us have dissolved. Your thoughts of me are the same. This is common to sages, fools, the wise, and the ignorant—it cannot be avoided by effort. One can only yield and follow, knowing that what does not forget endures.

Observing this dialogue, it reaches the utmost principle of life and death, the ebb and flow of creation. This is what earlier scholars never clarified and what Wei’s disciples could never hear. Only Yan Hui approached the realm of the sage, and so the Master spoke thus to him.

The phrase “passing like arms brushing” reveals the earnestness of his inquiry into the Dao, a bond like kinship, suffused with virtue and warmth. Yet how lamentable that the workings of transformation cannot be halted, and the time of shared dwelling cannot last! Still, knowing that what does not forget endures, the great constancy remains—unbound by transformation, beyond questions of coming and going, presence or absence.

What was spoken earlier concerns only one’s progress in the world—how could it suffice to glimpse the depths of the sage? *The Ocean of Meanings in the True Scripture of Southern Florescence*, Scroll Sixty-Three, concludes. *The Ocean of Meanings in the True Scripture of Southern Florescence*, Scroll Sixty-Four.

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu’s *Learning from Tian Zifang*, Part Two

Confucius visited Lao Dan, who had just bathed and was letting his hair dry, standing so still and remote that he seemed scarcely human. Confucius withdrew to wait, and after a while was received. He said, “Am I deluded, or is this truly so? Just now, Master, your form was like a withered tree, as though you had left all things and stood apart from humankind.”

Lao Dan replied, “I let my mind wander in the origin of things.”

Confucius asked, “What does that mean?”

Lao Dan said, “The heart is confounded and cannot know; the mouth is shut and cannot speak. I have tried to describe it for you in outline. The utmost yin is solemn and still; the utmost yang is blazing and bright. Solemn stillness issues from Heaven; blazing brightness arises from Earth. When the two intermingle, they form harmony, and things come to be. Some call this the guiding principle, yet none see its form. It waxes and wanes, now dark, now bright, changing day by day, month by month. Each day it acts, yet none see its work. Life has its sprouting; death has its return. Beginning and end turn back upon themselves without end, and none know where they cease. If not this, then what else could be their source?”

Confucius said, “May I ask about wandering in this?”

Lao Dan replied, “To attain this is the utmost beauty, the utmost joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy is to be a perfected person.”

Confucius said, “I would like to hear the method.”

Lao Dan said, “Beasts that eat grass do not resent changing marshes; creatures that live in water do not resent changing streams. They undergo small changes but do not lose their great constancy. Joy and anger, sorrow and delight do not enter their breasts. Now the world is the unity of the ten thousand things. If you attain this unity and become one with it, then your four limbs and hundred parts will be but dust and grime, and death and life, end and beginning will be like day and night, which cannot disturb you—how much less could the interruptions of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune? Those who cast off servitude do so as though discarding mud and mire, knowing that the self is nobler than servitude. What is noble resides in me and is not lost amid change. Moreover, the ten thousand transformations have never had an end—what could trouble the heart? Those who have become the Dao are released from this.”

Confucius said, “Master, your virtue matches Heaven and Earth, yet you still borrow the profoundest words to cultivate the heart. Which of the ancients could escape this?”

Lao Dan said, “Not so. Water, when clear, is effortless and naturally so. The perfected person, in regard to virtue, does not cultivate it, yet things cannot depart from it—like Heaven’s natural height, Earth’s natural thickness, the sun and moon’s natural brightness. What cultivation is needed?”

Confucius left and told Yan Hui, “In the Dao, I am like a gnat in a wine vat! Were it not for the Master’s lifting of my covering, I would not have known the great wholeness of Heaven and Earth.”

Guo’s commentary: Standing mute and seeming scarcely human, he had reached the utmost stillness and emptiness, so that self and mind were gone, and external things departed. What was not yet and suddenly is—wandering in the origin of things, one then understands that things do not act but are naturally so. The heart confounded, the mouth shut, he wished to lead Confucius to seek beyond words and meanings. Testing the discussion of yin and yang, he likened them to issuing from Heaven and arising from Earth, speaking of their intermingling. None see the form of the guiding principle, yet it never clings to the old, making clear that it is naturally so, and thus without achievement. Life sprouts from what is not yet gathered; death returns to dispersal. This is what is meant by “welcoming, one does not see the head; following, one does not see the rear.” The utmost beauty is without beauty; the utmost joy is without joy. Death and life are but small changes. Knowing small changes but not losing the great constancy, joy and anger, sorrow and delight do not enter the breast. Knowing the self is nobler than servitude, one discards it as though leaving behind dirt. If one knows that death and life are both the self, then what is noble is the self, and the self moves with change, thus nothing is lost. Those who have become the Dao are released from this—this is called “suspended release.” Lao Dan said that Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, all attain without cultivation. Confucius said that comparing his wholeness to Lao Dan’s was like comparing a vat to Heaven and Earth.

Lü’s commentary: Before things began, in movement and stillness, speech and silence, what was not wandering in the origin of things? The heart confounded cannot know what it knows; the mouth shut cannot speak what it speaks. Discussing “its outline” is not the utmost. Yin and yang intermingle to form harmony, and things come to be. From afar, this is the year; from near, this is the day. Without, it is the ten thousand things; within, it is the single body—none lack this. Some call it the guiding principle, yet none see its form. Waxing and waning, changing and transforming—it is only this. Life sprouts, death returns; beginning and end have no end—it is only this. Thus what was earlier called the origin of things is likely this. What the world calls beauty and joy is not the utmost beauty and joy. Attaining this, one then attains the utmost beauty and joy. Beasts changing marshes, fish changing waters—these are small changes that do not lose the great constancy of marshes and waters. Those who attain this and wander in it find the world as one, undivided. Then death and life cannot disturb them—how much less the interruptions of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune? Knowing the self is nobler than servitude, what is noble resides in me. Though there are small changes, how could one lose what is noble for the sake of what is base? The ten thousand transformations have no end—how could they burden the heart? Those who have become the Dao are released from this for this reason.

Yi Du’s commentary: The origin of things refers to the time before qi and form existed. Testing the discussion of “its outline” is difficult to express fully. Solemn stillness is the qi of the north; blazing brightness is the qi of the south. *Da Lü* is a yin tone, born in *si*, thus issuing from yang. *Huang Zhong* is a yang tone, born in *hai*, thus issuing from yin. Within yin and yang, each has a harmonizing qi, and through this, things come to be. Things come to be without knowing the guiding principle, and none see the form of yin and yang. Waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness, each day there is action—this summarizes the principle of yin-yang transformation.

The living emerge from the non-living—this is their sprouting. The dead enter the undying—this is their return. If not for yin and yang, who would preside over this? The supreme beauty of the world is no beauty; its supreme joy is no joy. Thus, what one attains is ever new, what one delights in is never stale. To possess the supreme beauty within oneself and wander in the supreme joy of things—this is the perfected person.

Death and life are minor transformations. The Dao is the great constancy. Beasts change marshes, fish change waters—just as humans abide within the great Dao, following change and yielding to transformation, never departing from the self. If death and life are but minor transformations, how could joy, anger, sorrow, and delight be worth concern? All things under heaven share this commonality. Grasping what they share, neither death nor life can disturb, much less gain or loss, fortune or misfortune.

The sage values the Dao above all; next, they value the body, and thus find rest. People all know the body is more precious than a servant, yet do not realize the body is a great burden. Knowing the Dao is more precious than the body, one holds constancy within oneself, and death and life cannot alter it. Between heaven and earth, the myriad transformations are boundless—how could they burden the heart? Only those who possess the Dao can comprehend this.

After hearing these ultimate words, Confucius again asked Laozi why, though his virtue matched heaven and earth, he still could not abandon speech. Laozi replied with the analogy of water and its tides: the perfected person’s virtue, like the height of heaven, the depth of earth, and the brightness of sun and moon, arises from spontaneity—what need is there for cultivation? Though I speak, it is as if I have not spoken.

Bi Xu’s commentary: "Withered wood, detached from things"—this describes storing essence and treasuring spirit. "Departing from others, standing alone"—this describes losing companionship and entering solitude. Wandering at the origin of things, one never strays from their source. To feign understanding is to weary the heart; to seek words is to stammer the mouth. Detaching the heart and forgetting speech—this is the closest one may come.

The solemn qi of yin descends below; the blazing qi of yang ascends above. The two forces intermingle in harmony, and the myriad things undergo wondrous transformation. Though it seems there is a guiding principle, its form is unseen. Waxing and waning follow their measures; darkness and light follow their constancy. Though it seems there is creation, its workings are unseen. Life sprouts from the indistinct; death returns to the obscure. Without beginning, none know its start; without end, none know its finish. If not for this Dao, what could serve as its master?

Confucius again inquired about the Dao of forgetting speech. To study the Dao is not to seek attainment but to grasp the supreme beauty and joy of one’s nature. Regarding death and life, it is like beasts changing marshes or fish changing waters—a fleeting, minor transformation. Why should one grieve? The world unites the myriad things as one. Viewed from what they share, one’s own limbs are but stench and decay; death and life are but waking and dreaming—how much more so for other things? Thus, holding the reins or donning court robes is like changing waters or marshes—this is what is meant by "externally transformed yet internally unchanged." What is precious lies within oneself, never departing from the self. Its joy is boundless—how could there be rest?

Like water flowing smoothly, embracing and benefiting all, what need is there for contrivance? The perfected person’s virtue and deeds spread far—what need is there for cultivation? It is like the height of heaven, the depth of earth, the brightness of sun and moon—what need is there for effort? Thus, the Master compared himself to discarding a mussel shell and removing a cover, recognizing the great wholeness of heaven and earth.

Yongzhai said: "Standing alone" speaks of transcending the world’s bounds. The origin of things is no-thing. Yin and yang arise from heaven and earth—these four lines describe the Dao as nothing but the alternation of yin and yang. Their interaction creates harmony, for solitary yin cannot generate, nor can solitary yang. It seems there is something governing this, yet its form is unseen. Waxing and waning, darkness and light—daily there is activity, yet its workings are unseen. Beginning and end without origin—all describe the Creator. Supreme beauty and joy praise the Dao’s wonder.

Though fish and beasts change waters and marshes, they do not lose their waters and grasses. Likewise, humans share this world—how could they be different? Knowing that all emerge from heaven and share the same nature, not even death and life can disturb, much less fortune or misfortune. Servants come and go, discarded like mud—this is because I am noble and they are base. If one knows the Dao’s preciousness truly lies within oneself, external changes cannot deprive one of supreme beauty and joy. The boundless transformations of the world—how could they burden the heart? Only the foolish and vulgar fail to understand; only those who unite with the Dao grasp this.

"Ultimate words" refer to the preceding text. Even Laozi could not depart from speech to cultivate the heart—who could escape this? The reply likens it to rivers and seas: their waters flow ceaselessly because their nature is effortless and spontaneous. The perfected person’s virtue, like heaven and earth, sun and moon, is also spontaneous—what need is there for effort?

The origin of things is nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth—this is the Supreme Ultimate. The solemn emerges from heaven; the blazing emerges from earth—this is the Supreme Ultimate moving to generate yang, reaching its limit and becoming still, stillness generating yin, stillness reaching its limit and moving again, endlessly cycling. It seems there is something governing this, yet its form is unseen—this is what is meant by "above, knowing the Creator is no-thing; below, knowing things create themselves." Understanding the origin of things, one knows the origin of oneself, and even the origin of heaven and earth—it is no different. Attaining this supreme beauty and wandering in supreme joy—this is the ultimate of the human Dao.

The life and death of things have sprouting and return; the life and death of humans need not be deeply examined. Minor transformations refer to life and death; the great constancy is indestructible. The indestructible is the root of the single spirit: at rest, it is called nature, containing emptiness as abundance; in motion, it is called the heart, entering the dusty world as insufficiency.

He who grasps this principle traverses change and penetrates constancy—such clarity is called illumination. His presence is like the moon reflected in water; his transformation is like the wind moving through the void. Why trouble over the ease of crossing rivers or marshes? The world is shared by the myriad things—are not the four limbs and hundred parts of the body likewise not mine alone? Knowing that the lowly may be discarded while the body’s nobility endures, how can gain or loss, fortune or misfortune disturb one’s clarity?

Water’s clarity is its natural nature, just as the virtue of the perfected person requires no cultivation, yet things naturally gravitate toward it. Heaven’s duty is to cover, earth’s duty is to bear, and the sage’s duty is to teach transformation—this is what constitutes great wholeness.

The essence of this chapter lies in the sprouting of life and the return of death, yet the ancient sages seldom spoke of it directly, wishing instead for people to turn inward and seek it themselves. When one fills the true and perceives the real, one is no longer swayed by life and death. Moreover, all people dwell between life and death—whether wise or foolish, none can escape it. In life, they strive for abundant nurture; in death, they prepare elaborate burials—this is everywhere the case, yet none know where the sprouting leads or the return goes. To know where it returns, one must first investigate where it sprouts. At first hearing, these words may seem vague, offering no foothold for effort, but through diligent study and mutual illumination of the classics, insight arises.

The *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi] once said: "Examine its beginning—originally there was no birth, not merely no birth but also no form, no qi, mingling in the boundless. Then it transformed and had qi; qi transformed and had form; form transformed and had life; life transformed and turned to death—this is how they follow one another like the four seasons." It also said: "He who is good at nurturing life is thus good at nurturing death."

The secret the ancient sages left unspoken, the perfected person has already explained in detail—people simply do not seek it! This Dao can be apprehended by the heart but cannot be exhausted in words. It is like the Chan school’s inquiry into the state before one’s parents were born or after the dispersal of wind and fire: though one may enter through a teacher’s guidance, ultimately one must awaken on one’s own. As the saying goes, "Once explained, it misses the mark." Scholars, take heed!

Zhuangzi visited Duke Ai of Lu. The Duke said, "Lu has many Confucians but few who follow your teachings, Master."

Zhuangzi replied, "Lu has few Confucians."

The Duke said, "The entire state of Lu wears Confucian robes—how can you say there are few?"

Zhuangzi said, "I have heard that Confucians wear round caps to know the seasons of heaven, square shoes to know the forms of earth, and wear pendants with tassels to decide matters as they arise. Those who possess the Way may not wear its robes, and those who wear its robes may not know the Way."

The Duke insisted this was not so and asked, "Why not issue a decree throughout the state that those who lack this Way yet wear its robes shall be put to death?"

Thereupon, Duke Ai issued the decree for five days, and no one in Lu dared wear Confucian robes—except for one man who stood at the palace gate in full Confucian attire. The Duke summoned him and questioned him on state affairs; his answers were inexhaustible, shifting through a thousand turns without faltering.

Zhuangzi said, "With all of Lu, there is only one Confucian—can this be called many?"

Guo Xiang’s commentary: "He whose virtue is full within does not adorn himself without."
Lü Huiqing’s commentary: "Zhuangzi repeatedly used Confucius to question Laozi’s disciples to show that so-called sagely wisdom does not exhaust the ultimate Dao. Without this discussion, scholars would have no way to know the true reverence for Confucius."
Yidu’s commentary: "Yangzi said, 'One who unites heaven, earth, and humanity is a Confucian—this is the true Confucian.' Inner possession of the Way is substance; outer robes are ornament. Lacking either, one is no Confucian. Only the sage embodies form and thus can be worthy of the robes. Those who have not attained sagehood yet wear Confucian attire are vulgar Confucians. With all of Lu wearing Confucian robes, there was but one true Confucian—this is the utmost reverence for Confucius."
Bixu’s commentary: "One Kui was enough to assist a king; why would the flourishing of Confucian teaching require three thousand? A sheep in tiger’s skin will surely confuse others. Yet one of profound virtue may appear foolish—how could there be no one who recognizes this?"
Yongzhai’s commentary: "This passage further illustrates that many wear Confucian robes yet know nothing of the Way."

The *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi], with its transcendent and extraordinary talent, lived in a turbid age where no one was worthy of conversation, leaving no outlet for its marvels. Thus, it discoursed on emperors and kings, discussed Confucius and Laozi, and evaluated Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Jie, and Robber Zhi without omission. In scrutinizing the reality of words and deeds and discerning the subtleties of the heart, it was as bright as a mirror illuminating the finest autumn hairs. Some say its discussions often criticize Confucius, but this is merely observing its words without probing its intent. This chapter concludes by noting that with all of Lu wearing Confucian robes, there was but one true Confucian—I say no one revered Confucius more than the *Nanhua*. Consider Su Shi’s *Record of the Zhuangzi Shrine*—it may serve to confirm that my words are not baseless.

Baili Xi did not let rank or salary enter his heart, so when he fed cattle, the cattle grew fat, enabling Duke Mu of Qin to forget his lowly status and entrust him with governance. The Lord of Yu did not let life and death enter his heart, so he could move others. When the Lord of Song was about to commission paintings, all the scribes arrived, bowed, and stood in attendance; half remained outside, licking their brushes and grinding ink. One scribe arrived late, walking unhurriedly, bowed without standing, and went to his lodging. The Lord sent someone to observe him and found him sitting with his robe undone, legs sprawled. The Lord said, "This is the true painter!"

Guo Xiang’s commentary: "He who is inwardly self-possessed is complete in external affairs, thus his spirit is at ease and his intent settled."
Lü Huiqing’s commentary: "From the small example of Baili Xi’s governance to the great example of the Lord of Yu’s ability to move others—those who let external things enter their hearts and yet achieve such things have never existed. Undressing and sprawling—this is the mark of a true master painter."
Yidu’s commentary: "Rank and salary are small matters; life and death are great affairs..."

He who can disregard rank and salary has not yet disregarded life and death; he who can disregard life and death can disregard all things. One who is inwardly self-important will be outwardly solemn; one who is inwardly sufficient will be outwardly at ease. Inward self-importance scatters the spirit, creating the suspicion of rejection when seeking advancement; outward ease settles the spirit, allowing action to carry the intent of non-action. The Lord of Yu selected a painter and found the true one—this was by means of the Dao.

Bixu’s commentary: "One who waits for destiny while herding cattle will be observed by others for his conduct; one who serves his parents while forgetting his own life will be examined by the multitude for his filial piety. Those hasty for others’ use have not yet attained mastery; those who are serene and self-possessed will surely refine their art. If even coarse advancement is thus, how much more the subtleties of principle?"

Yongzhai’s commentary: "When he herded cattle, how could he have had the mind to seek rank and salary? Precisely because he did not seek them, he was employed. To move others is to transform them through resonance. The painter, without intent to seek recognition, undressed and sprawled—this is how the Lord of Yu knew he was a true painter. Without concern for rank and salary, he herded cattle, and so Duke Mu entrusted him with governance and achieved order; without pride in skill or clumsiness, he sprawled, and so the Lord of Yu knew his painting was true. When the heart is empty, things adhere to it—this is because one who is inwardly sufficient is outwardly at ease. Those who pursue talent and skill in the world today are anxious lest others not recognize them, while those who employ talent value only outward adornment—no wonder their attainments lack refinement."

*Note on textual variant*: "Herding cattle made the cattle fat" should read "herding cattle made *him* flourish," meaning that Baili Xi, though in a lowly position, delighted in the Dao while plowing and forgot poverty, so that his four limbs were full and joyful—this does not refer to the cattle growing fat.

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu, on "Tian Zifang" III

King Wen observed in Zang and saw an old man fishing, yet his fishing was no fishing—he did not hold his rod as one who fishes, but fished as one always does. King Wen wished to raise him and entrust him with governance, but feared his great ministers and elders would not be at ease. He wished to leave the matter and release him, yet could not bear the thought of the common people being without heaven’s grace.

Thereupon, at dawn, he gathered his ministers and said: "Formerly, I dreamed of a worthy man, dark of complexion with a prominent brow, riding a piebald horse with one red hoof, who proclaimed: ‘Entrust governance to the old man of Zang, and the people may yet find relief!’" The ministers, startled, said: "This was the former lord, our king." King Wen said: "Then let us divine it." The ministers replied: "The command of the former lord—Your Majesty should have no doubt. What need is there for divination?"

Thus they welcomed the old man of Zang and entrusted him with governance. He altered no statutes, issued no partial decrees. After three years, King Wen surveyed the state and found that the knights had abandoned their posts and scattered, the high officials had failed to cultivate virtue, and the grain measures dared not enter the four borders. When knights abandon their posts and scatter, it is because they esteem uniformity; when high officials fail to cultivate virtue, it is because they share the same tasks; when grain measures dare not enter the four borders, it is because the feudal lords harbor no divided loyalties.

King Wen then made him Grand Preceptor, faced north, and asked: "Can this be extended to the realm?" The old man of Zang, silent and unresponsive, declined with vague words, issued orders by morning and fled by night, never to be heard of again.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: "Was King Wen still not sufficient? Why then did he rely on a dream?" Confucius said: "Hush! Say no more. King Wen fulfilled it—what need is there for criticism? He merely followed the moment’s exigency."

Guo's Annotation: He merely passed the years, seeking nothing in the end, untroubled by gain or loss—his fishing was but a pretense. "Esteeming uniformity" means blending one’s radiance with the dust. "Purifying oneself to completion" sets one apart from the common tasks. When all under Heaven trust, they align in measures, weights, and balances. The achiever is not the self, so when the work is done, the person must withdraw; when affairs are settled, the name must depart. Only with name gone and self retired can one extend to all under Heaven. King Wen entrusted all to his ministers without claiming authority himself—this was fulfillment. "The moment" refers to the sentiment of the hundred clans, the instant between awakening and unawareness; following it and acting upon it aligns with their great disposition.

Lü's Annotation: Knowing Zang the Elder was fit to govern, King Wen grasped this in the space between his fishing and not-fishing. Attributing it to a dream, expecting divination yet not divining—above, he feared the unease of great ministers and elders; below, he feared the people would be left without Heaven. After employing him for three years and observing the state, the results matched his words: if words could become dreams, they were not untrustworthy; if he wished to divine but did not, it was not irreverent—he simply followed the moment. No changes were made to the canonical laws; the Six Canons and Eight Statutes received from the Son of Heaven became the Way of the state. No partial decrees were issued, so they could be made public to the feudal lords before being enacted—this was how they extended to all under Heaven. "Uprooting the planted" destroys the factions one has cultivated; "grain measures" are not the fine measures of the former kings.

Yi Du’s Annotation: This passage is an allegory of King Wen employing the Grand Duke. Before obtaining the Grand Duke, King Wen could not bear the people being left without Heaven; entrusting the search to a dream was the sagely way of following human sentiment. Upon receiving him in governance, the great constant laws remained unchanged, and improper decrees were not issued. After three years, all under Heaven esteemed uniformity, so the knights’ integrity collapsed and their ranks scattered. "Planted" refers to the uprightness of trees—the conduct of knights. When uniformity was esteemed, their conduct became useless and collapsed, their bonds had no application and scattered. With uniformity, all under Heaven had no divergent tasks, so high officials did not cultivate virtue, and grain measures dared not enter the four borders. With such accomplishment, King Wen faced north to serve him, yet the Grand Duke remained silent and unresponsive, declined with vague words, issued orders by morning and fled by night, never to be heard of again. King Wen’s elevation of the Grand Duke was not because he could not act alone to respond to Heaven’s will, but because he did not wish to differ from the multitude—thus he entrusted the dream to follow the people’s sentiment in that fleeting moment.

Bi Xu’s Annotation: "His fishing and not-fishing" refers to the straight hook; he feigned fishing to await the time, making concealment in fishing his constant practice. King Wen presented the dream and consulted his ministers, who said, "What doubt or divination is needed regarding the former lord’s command?" They then welcomed him and entrusted him with governance. "Knights’ integrity collapsed and ranks scattered" means that when the state was well-ordered, loyal ministers withdrew and the fortified walls were abandoned. "High officials did not cultivate virtue" means the people were pure and governance was simple. "Grain measures dared not enter the borders" means the times were harmonious and the years abundant. "Esteeming uniformity" meant ruler and ministers were of one heart; "sharing tasks" meant the four classes were settled in their occupations. Yan Yuan still doubted the dream’s reality, but the answer was that the granting and withholding of power lay in that fleeting moment—King Wen had fulfilled it, so why criticize further?

Liu Chao’s Annotation: The Three Dynasties followed the straight Way. Knowing Zang the Elder possessed the Way, entrusting him with governance would have sufficed—why resort to a dream to convince the ministers? One who knows the Way must comprehend principle and understand expediency. The Way is Heaven—self-trust is sufficient. Expediency is human—how can it be abandoned? Confucius and King Wen fulfilled it, but Yan Yuan had yet to attain it. Thus, Gao Zong’s dream was of a similar kind; Gao Zong was one who followed the straight Way. His spirit reached the four directions and flowed with Heaven and Earth; the verification of utmost sincerity at the juncture of Heaven and humanity is like shadow and echo. His dream of obtaining a good minister is not to be doubted. Zhuangzi’s allegory of King Wen was to clarify that expediency must examine the past to verify the present—thus he feigned a dream to convince others. Scholars who extrapolate from Zang the Elder’s discourse to interpret the Grand Duke’s tradition miss the mark.

Yong Zhai’s Annotation: "Constant fishing" means the fishing rod was always in hand yet without intent to fish—thus it is said he did not hold his fishing as one who fishes. "Integrity collapsed and ranks scattered" means he did not establish cliques. "Not cultivating virtue" means not claiming credit. "Sharing tasks" means working with the multitude without setting himself apart. Foreign grain measures, varying in size, dared not enter the borders—none among the feudal lords harbored divided loyalties, and all knew where to return. "Morning orders" refers to his flight upon hearing King Wen’s question about extending to all under Heaven. "Never to be heard of again" speaks for itself.

The ancient text attributes this to *fufu*—the first *fu* read as "great," as in the First Emperor’s inscription on Mount Tai: "The Censor *fufu*," where the meaning is identical.

"Collapsed ranks" (*huaizhi*) has been variously explained. Sima’s annotation states: "lines of formation." "Scattered multitude" (*sanqun*) means he did not gather followers.

Another interpretation holds that *zhi* refers to border outposts where lodges were built to receive remonstrating scholars, as the *Chengshu* notes: "the lodges for remonstrating scholars." Master Fan of Wu Yin Range says *zhi* denotes border markers—wooden stakes planted as boundaries, akin to the willows of frontier passes or the barriers of frontier posts. "Collapsed ranks and scattered multitude" thus imply the dismantling of garrisons, the disbanding of troops, and the merging of neighboring domains into one—this is the custom of "elevating unity."

Further evidence appears in Sima Zichang’s *Letter from Yue Yi to the King of Yan*: "The border stakes of Jiqiu were transplanted to the bamboo groves of the Wen River." Xu Guang’s commentary explains that the boundaries of Yan were shifted to the bamboo fields by the Wen River in Qi, where *zhi* served as the demarcating objects. By this account, Fan’s interpretation is well-founded; other explanations are recorded in the various commentaries.

Lie Yukou shot arrows for Bohun Wuren, drawing the bow to full draw. He placed a cup of water on his elbow and loosed the arrow—each shaft vanished in turn, and as one arrow flew, the next found its place.

At that moment, he was like a wooden figurine. Bohun Wuren said: "This is the shooting of archery, not the archery of non-shooting. Have you ever climbed a high mountain with me, trodden perilous rocks, and stood at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss—could you shoot then?" Thereupon, Wuren ascended the high mountain, stepped onto the treacherous rocks, and stood at the brink of the sheer chasm. He walked backward to the edge, with two-thirds of his feet hanging over the void, then beckoned Lie Yukou forward. Lie Yukou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat streaming down to his heels.

Bohun Wuren said: "The perfected person soars above the azure heavens, plunges into the Yellow Springs below, roams the eight directions, yet his spirit and qi remain unaltered. Now you tremble with the intent to fix your gaze—this is perilous for your inner state!"

Guo’s commentary: *Ying guan* means the arrowhead is drawn to full tension. The left hand resists like a boulder, the right hand clings like a branch; the right hand releases the shot while the left remains unaware—thus the cup of water could rest on his elbow. The first arrow had not yet reached its mark when the next was already placed on the bowstring, demonstrating the marvel of his swiftness.

*Xiang ren* refers to the ultimate stillness. When virtue fills the inner self, spirit manifests outwardly; no matter how distant, deep, or obscure, all becomes luminous. Thus, he discerns the pivot of danger and security, abiding in tranquil self-possession. One who cannot perceive this ultimate division knows fear, and with fear, much is lost—how could this apply only to archery?

Lü’s commentary: *Yin zhi ying guan* signifies the utmost fullness of the draw. The elbow holding the cup of water exemplifies perfect steadiness. The first arrow had just been loosed when the next vanished, and as the first vanished, the following arrow was already nocked. *Vanished* describes the arrow’s departure, while *nocked* refers to the arrow now on the string—both terms describe the seamless, unbroken succession.

*Xiang ren* denotes the absence of divided awareness. This is the archery of shooting, whereas the archery of non-shooting is the preservation of pure qi, beyond the realm of skill, cunning, or boldness. Thus, one may ascend mountains or stand at the abyss without disturbance, and every shot finds its mark. Extending this principle, roaming the eight directions without altering one’s spirit and qi is only natural.

Yi Du’s annotation: Lie Yukou’s archery relied on precise awareness, enabling the arrow to vanish and the next to be nocked in turn. This is mastery within shooting, not the mastery of the Dao. Yet when observing Bohun Wuren’s ascent to the mountain’s edge, his backward steps to the brink, and Lie Yukou’s sweat dripping to his heels, even this reveals the coarse limits of sagely wisdom. As for roaming the eight directions with unchanging spirit and qi, none but the sage can achieve it—hence the warning: "This is perilous for your inner state."

The archery of shooting operates within the bounds of physical strength; the archery of non-shooting transcends even the notion of strength. Bi Xu’s commentary: Examining archery technique, the left hand resists like a boulder, the right hand clings like a branch—thus the cup of water could rest on the elbow. The bowstring loosed, the arrow flew, and the previous arrow vanished, as if the nock had split to admit it. Before the first arrow reached its target, the cup was already resting on the elbow again, illustrating the marvel of his swiftness. *Xiang ren* means unmoving.

The archery of shooting still adheres to technique. But to shoot while standing at the mountain’s edge or the abyss’s brink is to forget not only technique but even one’s form—thus one may roam the eight directions with unchanging spirit and qi.

Yongzhai observed: As one arrow was loosed, another already rested on the string. The arrow that had just left the bow vanished, and the next was already nocked. This seamless succession, shot after shot, is the archery of shooting. But when Bohun Wuren stood at the mountain’s edge, walked backward to the brink, and remained unshaken—this is the archery of non-shooting, the preservation of pure qi, the unchanging roaming of the eight directions.

This passage clarifies that those who exhaust their spirit in refined skill will soon reach their limits, while those who master skill through the Dao remain unshaken. To loose arrows in seamless succession, like a wooden figurine, is to perfect the art of archery. Yet when standing at the mountain’s edge or the abyss’s brink, one trembles and cannot stand—how then could one shoot? This is why Bohun Wuren demonstrated the archery of non-shooting, embedding the Dao within skill—not to make it the ultimate aim, but as a step toward roaming the eight directions. Those who cultivate the Way of nurturing spirit, let them observe this.

Some may wonder: Why does Lie Yukou, in writing his book, so humbly diminish himself? It is to exalt his teacher, and in exalting his teacher, to exalt the Dao. This is far beyond those who merely draw the bow of Hou Yi.

Master Fan of Wuyin, in his lecture following Lü’s commentary, corrected a minor oversight in Guo’s annotation, explaining that *fang shi* (方矢) carries the sense of *fang zhou* (方舟)—"side by side." It refers to the arrows already nocked on the string, not to placing the cup of water on the elbow. His interpretation is sound.

Jianwu asked Sunshu Ao: "You have served three times as prime minister without pride, and three times been dismissed without sorrow. At first, I doubted you, but now I see your nostrils flare with ease—how do you cultivate your mind?"

Sunshu Ao replied: "How do I surpass others? I accept what comes without refusal and let go of what departs without hindrance. I regard gain and loss as no concern of mine, and thus remain free of sorrow. How do I surpass others? Moreover, I do not know whether it lies with them or with me. If it lies with them, it is nothing to me; if it lies with me, it is nothing to them. I am still deliberating, still looking around—how could I have leisure to consider whether others esteem or despise me?"

Confucius heard of this and said: "The true persons of old could not be swayed by the clever, ensnared by the beautiful, robbed by thieves, or befriended by Fuxi or the Yellow Emperor. Life and death are great matters, yet they remained unchanged—how much less would rank and emolument affect them! Such persons thread their spirit through the great mountains without obstruction, plunge into the deepest springs without getting wet, dwell in lowly and humble places without weariness. Their fullness fills heaven and earth, and though they give to others, they themselves abound all the more."

The Guo commentary states: Vast and unbound, in profound unity with all things, what lies with them is not theirs alone to lose, nor what lies with me mine alone to keep. To hesitate and look around is to embrace the "no can do, no cannot do." Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor are but titles of merit, not the merit itself—thus their names are unworthy to befriend such persons. Those who would carve their flesh for the world lose both self and other. Let each person find their own fulfillment; to enable another’s fulfillment is to give without diminishing oneself. Their spirit and clarity fill heaven and earth, so wherever they dwell is fitting; wherever is fitting, they do not harm themselves for things but abide in the realm of self-possession.

The Lü commentary notes: With a serene ease between the brows, their breath descends to the heels, deep and subtle. Knowing that gain and loss are not theirs to claim, they accept fate and rest in it. Unaware whether it lies with them or with others, they forget through the Dao. To hesitate and look around is to be too occupied with self-examination to have leisure for others’ esteem or disdain. The true persons of old could not be swayed by eloquence, ensnared by beauty, plundered by thieves, or befriended by Fuxi or the Yellow Emperor—this is because they discerned the unborrowed and did not shift with things. Such persons thread their spirit through mountains and plunge into abysses, fill heaven and earth, and give to others while abounding all the more. This speaks to the inexhaustibility of the Dao.

The *Yidu* commentary observes: This echoes the *Analects* account of Lingyin Ziwen, illustrated through Jianwu. "Serene ease" describes the subtle movement of qi. When high rank comes, one accepts it; when it departs, one lets it go. Gain and loss are not one’s own—what cause for joy or sorrow? Forgetting self and other, returning to great unity, success and failure dissolve of themselves. Even heaven cannot bestow or strip away honor—how much less can people? The true person befriends transformation, so the wise cannot sway them with words, the beautiful cannot seduce them, thieves cannot rob them, and Fuxi or the Yellow Emperor cannot befriend them. Only thus can they thread through mountains without obstruction, plunge into abysses without getting wet, dwell in hardship without losing their flourishing, fill heaven and earth, and give to others while abounding all the more.

The *Bixu* commentary states: "Serene ease between the brows" describes a radiant, joyful countenance. I have no claim to superiority, and thus no pride—hence no sorrow. Moreover, life is but an illusion, an inn is but a transient lodging; the coming and going of high rank differ little from gnats flitting past the eyes. Thus, hesitating without advancing, one preserves the spirit in the realm of Dao and virtue; gazing in all directions, one rides the qi into the treasure of the mysterious. How could the esteem or disdain of others concern them? The true persons of old were unadorned and thus hard to sway, genuine and thus uncorrupted, desireless and thus beyond thieves, without craving and thus unyielding. Know this: where the heart is unobstructed, life and death cannot alter it; where form is unburdened, rank and emolument cannot entangle it. Such persons’ spirit has no fixed place, so it pierces the hardest without trace; their qi has no form, so it sinks into the softest without wetting. Hidden within the boundless, filling the limitless, they extend their power to things—things are satisfied, yet they themselves overflow.

The *Yongzhai* commentary says: "Serene ease between the brows" reflects breath dwelling within, nurturing the self. If the honor of the ministerial post belonged to the minister, it would have no bearing on me; if my own worth belonged to me, it would have no bearing on the minister. Thus it is said: "If it lies with them, it is nothing to me; if it lies with me, it is nothing to them." To hesitate and look around is to gaze loftily and wander in thought between heaven and earth—how could one know what others call honor or disgrace? The wise cannot be swayed, for words cannot exhaust them. The beautiful cannot seduce, for beauty cannot corrupt. Thieves cannot rob, for force cannot bend. Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor cannot befriend, for they withdrew from the world and held it lightly. "Obstruction" means hindrance. "Lowly and humble" means poverty and low status. The Dao resides within yet fills heaven and earth; extending it to transform others, its use is inexhaustible. At ease in the center, the breath between the brows is serene, deep yet subtly moving. Knowing that rank and emolument come unbidden and depart unstoppable, one sees gain and loss as not one’s own and wears no look of sorrow—this is how they surpass others. Is it with creation or with me? If with me, then creation is nothing; if with creation, then I am nothing. Forgetting both self and other—what cause for sorrow? To hesitate and look around is to be self-possessed, with no leisure for others’ esteem or disdain. Their joy lies within, and they view three rises and three falls in office as motes of dust passing before them. This speaks of those who accept fate and forget honor and disgrace, who scorn profit and forget rank and emolument. Thus Confucius likened them to the true persons of old. The true person remains unchanged by life and death, for their vast qi fills heaven and earth; extending it to benefit others, its use is boundless.

The *Nanhua* parable of Jianwu and Shu’ao serves as a measure for serving or withdrawing, yet inwardly, joy and harm are neither gained nor lost. Such a one is fit to discuss the Dao. The King of Chu sat with an ordinary lord. After a while, the king’s attendants said the ordinary lord had died three times. The lord said: "The death of the ordinary is not enough to lose what I possess." If the ordinary’s death does not lose what I possess, then the Chu’s existence is not enough to preserve existence. From this perspective, the ordinary never truly died, and Chu never truly existed.

The Guo commentary explains: The ordinary lord had three signs of death. "Not enough to lose what I possess" means abandoning the ordinary. To abandon it is not to see death as death, so existence is not enough to be called existence. Only vast and unassuming is the constant presence—existence and nonexistence lie in where the heart is placed. In truth, the world has no existence or nonexistence.

The Lü commentary states: In the world, what is constantly present, neither dying nor being born, is the true existence.

To preserve the constant presence is to truly preserve existence. How can the cases of Fan and Chu suffice to represent existence and nonexistence?

Yi Du’s annotation: The state’s existence is the existence of things; my existence is the existence of destiny. As for destiny, though the state perish, what is inherently mine does not perish. Those bound to things, though the state endure, have already lost what they possess. The King of Chu coveted another’s state, and his attendants warned, “Fan exhibits three signs of ruin,” desiring to claim that state. The Lord of Fan, unbound to his state, thus declared, “The death of Fan is not enough to lose what I possess.” Since Fan’s death does not lose what I possess, then Chu’s existence is not enough to preserve existence—mocking the King of Chu, whose so-called existence is already lost, and whose state’s survival is of no benefit. From this perspective, Fan never truly died, and Chu never truly existed. Viewed through the Dao, there is no existence or nonexistence.

Bixu’s annotation: The King of Chu harbored ambitions to annex neighboring lands, so his attendants sought to sway him with words. Fan’s three signs of ruin were: disrespect for the elderly, disregard for the worthy, and neglect of the people. “Fan’s death is not enough to lose what I possess” means not taking the loss of one’s state as a disaster. “Chu’s existence is not enough to preserve existence” means that though the state endures, one’s life is already forfeit. Thus, existence and nonexistence lie in the Dao, not in the state.

Yongzhai’s commentary: This echoes the idea that the amputee retains dignity in his remaining foot—meaning the Dao within oneself is independent of whether one possesses a state or not. Fan is not defined by ruin, nor Chu by existence; thus, worldly gains and losses are but external things. Yet the crux lies in the phrase “Chu’s existence is not enough to preserve existence.” The loser need not regret, nor the gainer boast—these words carry profound meaning. The Lord of Fan, unburdened by the state’s demise, preserved his own existence, knowing the self outweighs the state. The King of Chu, prideful in his state’s survival, had already lost what truly mattered, valuing the state above himself. If the self outweighs the state, the state’s ruin brings no harm; if the state outweighs the self, the state’s survival avails nothing. Thus, the noble person preserves virtue and power, not rank or territory—how much less the petty gains and losses beneath them?

This discourse begins with Zifang’s master, whose appearance belied his celestial nature, his hidden virtue too radiant to be named—sufficient to awaken the Marquis Wen to the falsity of his learning. The state of Wei’s entanglements were thus skillfully illuminated by the master’s virtue, a single word awakening the ruler. Why lament one’s own failure to stand or the Dao’s failure to spread? When Confucius met Wenbo Xuezi, the Dao was present in a glance—enlightenment need not lie in tedious instruction. Yan Hui, transcendent and untethered, seemed to lag behind, yet the great transformation works in subtle shifts—why not seek it in the fleeting moment? Laozi wandered at the origin of things, and Confucius recognized his detachment, possessing a singular vision. Such encounters plumb the profound—would further questions not be superfluous? Yet without seizing the moment to expound the principle, how could later learners benefit? Thus, the text delves into the mysteries of yin-yang harmony and the generation of things, tracing their sprouts to their ultimate return, so all may grasp the greatness of heaven and earth and forget the petty changes of form.

When Duke Ai claimed Lu teemed with Confucians, he judged by robes and caps; Zhuangzi examined their conduct and found them wanting. Yet when he proclaimed Confucius alone endured in the state, it revealed the indestructibility of the true Dao and the ease with which false learning fades. How could such discernment be deceived? King Wen elevated Zang the Elder; once governance was complete, he vanished by night. Those who govern with intent prioritize worthy ministers; those who respond without attachment do not cling to achievement. The way of ruler and minister reaches its pinnacle here—setting a standard for all ages.

As when Bohun observed Liezi’s archery or Shu Ao thrice resigned without distress—these are discussions of those who have mastered destiny, transcending the human to merge with heaven, moving freely through the eight directions, untouched by life and death. Only when learning the Dao reaches this point does it attain perfection. Otherwise, one is merely outwardly compliant while inwardly imperiled.

Concluding with the parable of the King of Chu and the Lord of Fan’s survival or ruin, it clarifies the distinction between self and externals—truly understanding what is weighty. *The Ocean of Meanings in the True Scripture of Southern Florescence*, Scroll Sixty-Five, ends. *The Ocean of Meanings in the True Scripture of Southern Florescence*, Scroll Sixty-Six.

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin, in his study of *Knowing the Northward Journey*:

*Knowing the Northward Journey* unfolds upon the Dark Waters, ascending the Hidden Well Mound, where it chanced upon Yuanwei Wei. Knowing addressed Yuanwei Wei, saying: "I would ask you this: What thoughts, what reflections lead to knowing the Dao? What dwelling, what practice brings repose in the Dao? What following, what path secures attainment of the Dao?" Three questions, yet Yuanwei Wei made no reply—not that he refused to answer, but that he knew not how to answer.

Knowing, receiving no response, returned south of the White Waters, ascended Fox Terrace, and there beheld the madman Qu. Knowing posed the same questions to the madman Qu. Qu replied: "Ah! I know the answers and shall tell you." Yet midway through speaking, he forgot what he meant to say.

Knowing, still unanswered, returned to the Imperial Palace and questioned the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor said: "Without thought, without reflection—only then does one know the Dao. Without dwelling, without practice—only then does one find repose in the Dao. Without following, without path—only then does one attain the Dao."

Knowing asked the Yellow Emperor: "You and I know this, yet they do not—who is correct?" The Yellow Emperor replied: "Yuanwei Wei is truly right; the madman Qu approaches it. You and I remain far from it. For those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Thus the sage enacts the teaching without words. The Dao cannot be summoned; virtue cannot be reached. Benevolence may be enacted, righteousness may be diminished, and ritual is but mutual pretense. Hence it is said: Lose the Dao, and virtue follows; lose virtue, and benevolence follows; lose benevolence, and righteousness follows; lose righteousness, and ritual follows. Ritual is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of chaos. Thus it is said: The practitioner of the Dao daily diminishes, diminishing further and further until reaching non-action—non-action that does not act. Now that one has become a thing, to return to the root is no easy task! Yet how simple it is for the great person! The living are companions of the dead; the dead are the beginning of the living—who knows their order? Human life is the gathering of qi; when gathered, there is life; when scattered, there is death. If death and life are companions, what cause have I for distress? Thus the myriad things are one. What they deem wondrous is divine and marvelous; what they despise is foul and rotten. Yet the foul and rotten transform into the divine and marvelous, and the divine and marvelous revert to the foul and rotten. Thus it is said: The world is pervaded by a single qi. Therefore the sage values unity."

Knowing said to the Yellow Emperor: "I questioned Yuanwei Wei, and he did not respond to me—not that he refused to respond, but that he did not know how. I questioned the madman Qu, who began to tell me but did not, not that he refused, but that midway he forgot. Now I ask you, and you know—why then are you not near?"

The Yellow Emperor replied: "He is truly right because he does not know. This one approaches it because he forgets. You and I remain far because we know."

When the madman Qu heard this, he deemed the Yellow Emperor one who knew speech.

Guo’s commentary: Allowing things to proceed of themselves—this is the teaching without words. The Dao resides in spontaneity, not in governance through speech. Not losing virtue is called virtue, yet even in naming virtue, one does not reach it. Ritual has fixed forms, from which arise artificiality and imitation. Thus the practitioner of the Dao willingly sheds its flowers and falsity. When ornament departs, simplicity is complete—though one acts, it is as if one does not act. Things lose their proper place, hence there is becoming a thing. To return to the root is no easy task! Only the great person embodies transformation, and transforming things is no difficulty. One who knows the way of transformation does not regard life and death as distinct. Each becomes the beginning of the other—who knows which is death and which is life? All gather and scatter—why should I rest? Each deems what it cherishes divine and marvelous, and what it detests foul and rotten. Yet what they cherish, I may despise; what I cherish, they may detest. Thus all share in the divine and marvelous, all share in the foul and rotten—how do death and life, self and other, differ? Taking not-knowing as true knowing, and knowing as not near, reveals that spontaneity is not attained through speech or knowledge. Thus the standard of non-speech is first raised, and clarity is later entrusted to the Yellow Emperor—so the obscurity of spontaneity may be glimpsed."

Lü’s commentary: *Knowing the Northward Journey* returns to the root, seeking what is shared and plumbing the depths of the mysterious. Hidden, it is not entangled; in the well, it is not obscured. Non-action entails no affairs; non-speaking entails no words. Not answering speech is the way of non-action. Returning south of the White Waters, one hastens toward clarity, seeking it on Fox Terrace or in some unfilled place. Madness knows no direction; Qu cannot extend. The Yellow Emperor’s palace is where the mind resides. The Dao cannot be known through knowledge—Yuanwei Wei’s not-knowing is true knowing. The madman Qu, desiring to speak yet forgetting, is not ignorant—thus he approaches it. You and I know, and thus remain far. The Dao has no direction, so it cannot be summoned; summoning it would beckon it to come. Virtue is within, so it cannot be reached; reaching would be a movement from here to there. Virtue is non-action, yet benevolence may be enacted; benevolence is partiality, yet righteousness may be diminished. Ritual is enacted but meets no response—flailing arms yet clinging to it—this is mere pretense, the beginning of chaos. Thus the practitioner of the Dao daily diminishes, diminishing until reaching non-action—non-action that does not act. Then benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music have no choice but to vanish. When non-action does not act, what of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are not the Dao? Now that one has become a thing, possessing knowledge, to return to the root is difficult indeed! Yet for the great person, radiant and unobscured by things, returning to the root amid the teeming is an easy matter. Life and death, beginning and end—no origin, no order. Qi gathers to form life; qi scatters to bring death."

The knowledge that qi’s gathering and scattering are but transient—what rest does this leave? Thus the myriad things are one. What one deems wondrous is called divine and marvelous; what one detests is called foul and rotten—yet these two transform into each other and nothing more. From this we know that all under Heaven is a single qi, which is why the sage values oneness.

*Dú* annotates: North and water both belong to the realm of knowing. The hidden and obscure alternate with the manifest, illustrating the interplay of yin and yang. "Non-action, non-utterance"—this is the Dao. Three questions met with no answer, that one might find it within the realm of non-speech. To wish to speak yet forget what one wished to say—this is the unattainable spoken. Turning back to the Imperial Palace to inquire, the Yellow Emperor, using the metaphor of the central Dao, answered with "no thought, no adornment, no following"—this is how one knows the Dao, rests in the Dao, and attains the Dao.

Knowledge cannot yet forget speech, so one says, "You and I know it," while that "non-action, non-utterance" and the madman Kuang’s ignorance—who is right? The Yellow Emperor could embody the Dao of non-action while engaging in action, thus taking "no answer" as truth. To wish to answer yet forget how is to resemble it, for speech ultimately does not approach the Dao. He further cited Laozi’s words to convey the meaning that the knowing do not speak.

"Non-action, non-utterance"—this is true knowing. The Dao of the profound and distant cannot be reached; the ever-renewing virtue cannot be attained. Benevolence can be enacted, yet the highest benevolence acts without deeming it right. Righteousness can be diminished, yet the highest righteousness acts while considering it right. Ritual is mere pretense, which is why it appears after virtue, the Dao, benevolence, and righteousness—this is the thinning of loyalty and trust and the beginning of chaos.

Daily diminishing what is known can lead to the Dao; daily diminishing still involves action. Diminish further and further until reaching non-action—then the myriad dharmas are all empty, adapting only to change. Now that one has become a thing, to return to the root and revert to the origin—is this not difficult? Only for the great person is it easy!

Death is the beginning of life, thus knowing life is the end of death. The *Book of Changes* says: "Essence and qi become things—this is qi’s gathering. The advancing hun-soul becomes transformation—this is qi’s scattering." If death and life are one, why lament their transience?

The divine and marvelous are what people favor; the foul and rotten are what they detest. Yet all arise from a single qi, endlessly revolving. The sage values oneness to illuminate the natural Dao, which cannot be attained through speech or knowledge but only by merging with the principle of non-speech.

*Bìxū* annotates: Knowing roams above the Dark Waters, wishing to conceal knowledge in profound silence. Yet knowing does not remain silent forever—where there is concealment, there is also emergence. Knowing has no rest, so it knocks on the gates of the obscure to seek tranquility. "Non-action, non-utterance" with "no answer" as the answer—how profound its meaning!

White Waters: one turns toward the light. The Imperial Palace: the numinous abode. The Yellow Emperor: the true sovereign. Withdrawing sight and reversing hearing, all existents are empty. To regard knowledge as right and ignorance as wrong is to compound error. The teaching of non-speech is the wondrous existence.

Yet even truth and true knowing are obstacles to the Dao, especially difficult to remove. The great Dao has no form to be reached; the highest virtue has no virtue to be attained. Benevolence embraces all, but its flaw is partiality and enactment. Righteousness governs judgment, but its flaw is usurpation and diminishment. Ritual exalts dignity, but its flaw is artifice and the rise of pretense. All stem from the loss of knowing, leading to chaos. One must first diminish knowledge, then diminish non-knowledge to reach non-knowing. After non-diminishing comes non-action, and after non-action comes non-non-action.

In non-action, there is no self—who but the great person achieves this? Only by forgetting life can death not bind; only by forgetting death can one return to life’s origin. To know its order is to recognize its beginning. Where there is gathering, there is scattering. Seeing life and death as a single thread, where is there no leisure?

The divine and marvelous are nature; the foul and rotten are form. All things deem the preservation of nature as beauty and its decay as evil. Nature transforms into form, and form returns to nature—all within a single qi. Attain oneness, and the myriad affairs are complete. Who would not value it?

The utility of having and not-having lies in their mutual necessity—coarse and subtle depend on each other. Thus, first presenting "non-action, non-utterance" with no answer illustrates the subtlety of the ultimate principle. Next, the madman Kuang’s wish to speak yet forgetting shows the meeting of speech and silence. Finally, the Yellow Emperor’s knowing uses words to expound the Dao, for knowledge is coarse, while transcending speech is subtle.

*Yōngzhāi* says: The opening passage divides into three sections—truth, semblance, and distance—with the main idea being that the knowing do not speak, and the speaking do not know. It continues that the Dao cannot be reached through words, nor virtue through traces. Benevolence, righteousness, and ritual all leave traces, thus encircling the Dao, with ritual being the worst offender!

Discarding the body and silencing the senses—this is the daily diminishing of the Dao. Diminish further and further until forgetting one’s former self, reaching non-action, and following the natural principle of Heaven—nothing remains to be done. Seeking the Dao while still clinging to things makes one no different from them, and returning to the root becomes difficult. "Returning to the root" means reverting to the origin of things, which only the great person achieves with ease through non-action.

Life is the companion of death; death is the beginning of life—like the blooming of flowers and trees, an inexhaustible principle. Thus, what lives is as if already dead. *Yíchuān* says: The rest of re-entering is not the rest of what has already emerged—this is the meaning. Life and death come and go—who knows their guiding principle is qi? If one knows life and death are but a single principle, why lament their transience or oneness?

The myriad things share one principle of life and death, yet people divide them into likes and dislikes, beauty and ugliness.

Just as flowers and plants in full bloom are deemed wondrous, yet when they wither, they become foul and rotten—unaware that fallen leaves nourish the roots, and new life begins anew from this very decay, so foulness and rottenness transform back into the wondrous. From ancient times to the present, there is only this single qi. The sage understands this, and thus does not distinguish between life and death, fortune and misfortune.

"One" means no distinction. *Chu Shi’s* *Guǎnjiàn* states: Knowing the northward journey to the dark waters is a metaphor for the learned scholar’s desire to return to the root. The hidden well on the hill signifies one who has not fully concealed themselves, whose knowledge still seeks to instruct others. Non-action means no longer speaking of knowledge, hence questions go unanswered. Returning south of the White Waters, one seeks it again in brightness. When the fox’s gate is closed, the mind of doubt is already empty. The "madly bent" refers to those deemed mad yet preserved in wholeness. Desiring to speak yet forgetting the light, one finds speech unattainable. Returning to the Emperor’s palace, one seeks within. The master of the Yellow Chamber, when questioned, cannot but respond, and thus reveals that knowing the Dao, abiding in the Dao, and attaining the Dao lie solely in non-thought, non-dwelling, and non-following. "Truly so" means grasping its reality; "resembling it" is secondary. If one does not draw near, one drifts far from the Dao!

Such is the contrast in understanding words—no wonder the Master, in dealing with others, listens to their words but observes their conduct. The teaching without words is led by personal example, requiring no reliance on speech. The Dao descends to become virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual—just as humans are born with knowledge, knowledge leads to ability, ability leads to servitude, and servitude makes one an object of objects, making it difficult to return to the root. Only the great person can master things, and thus finds it easy.

Life and death are but the gathering and scattering of a single qi. The wondrous and the foul transform into one another—this is merely how people label what they find beautiful or ugly. The sage values unity, for in unity all is undivided; how then can one distinguish between the wondrous and the foul? Only those who understand life and death as companions can speak of this.

The passage beginning "The Yellow Emperor said..." reiterates earlier text and requires no further explanation.

Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons have clear patterns yet do not debate; the myriad things have inherent principles yet do not explain. The sage traces the beauty of Heaven and Earth and comprehends the principles of the myriad things. Thus, the perfected person practices non-action, and the great sage does not act—this is called observing Heaven and Earth.

Now, that numinous clarity and utmost refinement, together with the hundred transformations—whether things live or die, are square or round—none know their root. Yet all things have existed since antiquity, self-subsistent. The Six Directions are vast, yet remain within it; the tip of an autumn hair is small, yet depends on it to form its body. All under Heaven rise and fall, never constant throughout life. Yin and yang, the four seasons, move in their cycles, each in its proper order. Vast and indistinct, as if absent yet present; flowing and formless, yet spirit-like—nurturing the myriad things without their awareness. This is called the root, by which one may observe Heaven.

*Guo’s* commentary: The perfected person practices non-action, relying solely on natural compliance. Observing their form and appearance, adapting to what is fitting, they differ not from Heaven and Earth. Thus, the hundred transformations transform themselves, and the numinous clarity remains undisturbed; the dead die of themselves, the living live of themselves; the round are round of themselves, the square are square of themselves. There is no maker of their root, hence none know it. Since antiquity, they have existed of themselves—how could they depend on being made?

To consider the Six Directions as within the boundless is narrow. Though the tip of an autumn hair is small, without the boundless, it would have no place to contain its essence. The four seasons move in their cycles—do they depend on being made? If it were manifestly present, it would be absent; if it were held in tangible form, it would lack spirit. To nurture things without grasping their root in inherent nature is to not know how they are nurtured.

*Lü’s* commentary: Heaven and Earth practice non-action yet lack nothing, for they possess great beauty. The four seasons alternate, beginning and ending without confusion, for they have clear patterns. Though the myriad things are many, the Dao is not absent from them, for they have inherent principles. Beauty fills their midst, patterns can be emulated, and principles—wherever one goes—all return to the Dao alone.

The sage traces beauty and comprehends principles, knowing that what is not done arises naturally—this is called observing Heaven and Earth. Now, that numinous clarity and utmost refinement, together with the hundred transformations—viewed from the perspective of things, they live or die, are square or round—how can one know their root? Yet though all things are vast and indistinct, none are not "that." Since antiquity, they have existed of themselves, and "that" has never departed. Yin and yang, the four seasons, each in their proper order—who else but "that" brings this about? As if absent yet present, formless yet spirit-like, it cannot be sought in the realm of being or non-being. The myriad things are thus interwoven, yet none know why—this is called the root.

*Yi Du’s* commentary: Great beauty is yin and yang. Clear patterns are generation and transformation. Inherent principles are nature and destiny. The sage roots themselves in the beauty of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and comprehends the principles of the myriad things’ nature and destiny. Inwardly, they become a perfected person and practice non-action; outwardly, though they act as a sage, their actions arise from non-doing. Observing the convergence of Heaven and Earth, they enact their rites and ceremonies alone.

Numinous clarity is the utmost refinement of Heaven and Earth. The hundred transformations transform themselves, and the numinous clarity does not interfere. Thus, whether things live or die, are square or round, none know their root. Vast and indistinct, all things have existed since antiquity, enduring from the distant past without aging. The Six Directions do not depart from this Dao, and even the tip of an autumn hair depends on this Dao to form. All under Heaven rise and fall by this alone. The Dao is ever-renewing, never constant, and thus yin and yang, the four seasons, follow it to attain their proper order. As if absent yet present, formless yet spirit-like, things are nurtured by it without awareness—this is called the root, the mystery that fashions the myriad things.

Extending this insight, one may contemplate the Way of Heaven.

The great beauty blankets and sustains all; its luminous laws govern life and death, completing principles and distinguishing categories. Words distort beauty, debates corrupt laws, and explanations disorder principles. Only the primal non-action silently accords with the four seasons, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, endlessly transforming without limit—this may be called the essence of clarity.

All things are self-so, thus none know their root. Standing alone and unchanging, neither Heaven nor Earth could contain them without numinous clarity, nor could the tip of an autumn hair be formed without utmost refinement. The sage models the movements of Heaven and Earth, and things receive their blessings without awareness—this is called the root.

The great beauty is that spoken of in the *Yijing*: "With great beauty, benefit all under Heaven." The luminous laws are the fixed patterns of cold and heat’s alternation. The completion of principles refers to the causes of small and large, long and short—how could these be expressed! Primal non-action is all self-so. That by which the sage accords with the self-so is attained from Heaven and Earth alone. Numinous clarity and utmost refinement speak of the wondrous principle. The life and death, square and round of things are all wrought by numinous clarity and utmost refinement—who could exhaust their root and limit?

Vast and indistinct, the transformations of things are without pause, yet creation endures. As Su Dongpo said: "That which passes is like this, yet it has never gone"—none but the truly perceptive can speak thus. Rising and falling, coming and going. "Without constancy" means ever-renewing. "Indistinct" means invisible. "Abundant" speaks of the vitality of life. "As if absent yet present"—death is but a companion of life. "Formless yet spirit-like"—it does not rely on form to stand. This passage from the *Nanhua* establishes its own discourse, continuing the earlier theme of primal non-action.

The first three phrases echo: "What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born." The sage embodies Heaven and Earth to nurture the myriad things—how could this be mere inert non-action, like a wooden puppet? For non-action emerges from the primal, and action is rooted in non-action, just as the movements of celestial timing and the fertility of earthly advantage do not transgress the self-so.

Uniting the numinous clarity and utmost refinement of Heaven and Earth with the hundred transformations of things, their flourishing and withering, their forms and appearances, are all manifestly visible—yet none know what brings them about. This is called the root. "Vast and indistinct, the myriad things"—this is the meaning of the teeming multitude. "Existing since antiquity"—the Way does not change. Thus, it pervades the Six Directions in its vastness, enters the tip of an autumn hair in its subtlety, moves with things in their currents while ever-renewing, and yin and yang together revolve in proper order.

"As if absent yet present"—dimly, something is there. "Formless yet spirit-like"—obscurely, clarity is seen. All things are born and nurtured by this, yet do not know it as their root. What is called the root—how could it be sought elsewhere? Turn inward to one’s own body and find that by which one is given life. Knowing the root and guarding it without departure—this is called returning to the root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called recovering the mandate. Only at this stage in the study of the Way may one advance further. Taking yet another step into the profound, it is said: "One may contemplate the Way of Heaven."

Now, the version collated by Liu Deyi, the Illuminated Scatterer of Chen Bixu, aligns with this. Comparing it with the preceding text, it is superior in meaning.

*End of Southern Florescence True Scripture: Sea of Meanings Compiled and Elucidated, Scroll Sixty-Six*
*Beginning of Southern Florescence True Scripture: Sea of Meanings Compiled and Elucidated, Scroll Sixty-Seven*

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin annotates *Knowing the Northern Journey*, Second Chapter:

Nie Que asked the Way of Bei Yi. Bei Yi said: "Correct your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of Heaven will arrive. Gather in your knowledge, unify your measures, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will become your beauty, the Way will become your dwelling. You will gaze with the clarity of a newborn calf, without seeking its cause."

Before his words were finished, Nie Que fell asleep. Bei Yi rejoiced greatly, departed singing, and said:
"Form like withered bones, heart like dead ashes—truly, this is its genuine knowing, not clinging to the past to sustain itself.
Vague and obscure, without mind and beyond consultation—what manner of man is this?"

Guo’s commentary: "Not clinging to the past to sustain itself—this is moving with change. Without mind and beyond consultation—this is solitary transformation."
Lü’s commentary: "Correct the form, and one sits in fullness. Unify the gaze, and there is no delusion. Thus, deviant qi retreats, and the harmonious and balanced returns. Gather in knowledge, and one returns to the root; unify measures, and one does not stray. Spirit comes to dwell, and one guards the form without departure. Virtue becomes beautiful, filling and returning to the beginning. The Way returns, resting and gathering in emptiness. Like a newborn calf, one does not know where it goes. Before the words were finished, Nie Que feigned sleep, yet heard them as if riding a chariot. Bei Yi departed singing, delighted by how easily he had settled into this state. Form withered and heart ashen—this is the utmost stillness. Truly, this is its genuine knowing, for it is without knowing. Not clinging to the past to sustain itself—this is the remnant of its arising. The latter three phrases describe the depth of his attainment, yet I know not who he is."

Yi Zhu’s commentary: "Correct the form, and one does not stray; unify the gaze, and one does not wander. Thus, harmony and principle emerge. Gather in knowledge to relinquish knowledge; unify measures to forget measures. Thus, the heart is empty, and spirit comes to unite. Only through utmost harmony does virtue become your beauty; only through utmost emptiness does the Way become your dwelling. Gazing with the clarity of a newborn calf—this speaks of the wholeness of spirit. Without seeking its cause—this is daily renewal. Before the words were finished, Nie Que feigned sleep. Bei Yi, rejoicing in his attainment of the Way, departed singing. Truly, this is its genuine knowing, not clinging to the past to sustain itself—this is moving with transformation. Vague and obscure, without mind—this is being a person of transformation."

Bi Xu’s commentary: "When the body is not deviant and the eyes do not wander, the harmonious and balanced gathers. Withdrawing awareness and simplifying measures, auspiciousness abides. Then, all beauties follow, and purity remains. The gaze is clear and illuminating, not floating outward. The Way is near at hand. Thus, the ear hears what can be spoken, and spirit enters the wondrous gate. Immediate comprehension arises, and stillness is like sleep. Form like withered bones, heart like dead ashes—this is correcting the form and unifying the gaze. Truly, this is its genuine knowing, not clinging to the past to sustain itself—this is gathering in knowledge and unifying measures. Vague and obscure, virtue becomes beautiful and mindless, beyond consultation—thus the Way dwells. These all praise Nie Que’s virtuous bearing, and the wondrous subtlety of his feigned sleep, which words cannot fully express."

Yongzhai said: "Correcting the form and unifying the gaze—this is forgetting one’s body, ears, and eyes. Gathering in knowledge and unifying measures—this is relinquishing thought, deliberation, and consciousness. Thus, original qi is preserved, and spirit comes to dwell. Virtue becomes beautiful—this means it suffices to nourish the body. The Way dwells—this is dwelling in the vast dwelling of all under Heaven. Gazing with clarity—this is the appearance of knowing without knowing, looking directly. A newborn calf looks without mind, as does an infant. Without seeking its cause—this means not knowing why it looks as it does. Before the words were finished, he slept—speech and meaning were in accord, leaving no room for words. Truly seeing the reality of this principle, things do not enter the heart. Vague and obscure—this is the appearance of indistinctness. Since he is without mind, there is nothing I can say—what manner of man is this? This is profound praise. A good teacher establishes principles with simplicity; a good student receives transformation swiftly. Correcting the form and unifying the gaze—this is regulating the external. Gathering in knowledge and unifying measures—this is ordering the internal. This can be called simplicity of principle. Before the words were finished, he fell asleep—this is swift transformation indeed. The phrase 'gazing with the clarity of a newborn calf' best depicts the beauty of virtue, the dwelling of the Way, the absence of mind and action, and the state of pure harmony, utterly forgetting things. Observing this, one can know the method of entering the Way. Bei Yi’s departing song shares the same meaning as Zigong’s praise of the old man of Hanyin. When people rest, their minds are in the repository of schemes and the master of knowledge. Now, without mind and beyond consultation, he sighs in admiration of his pure virtue, saying there is no one like this in the world."

Shun asked Cheng: "Can the Way be obtained and possessed?"
Cheng said: "Your body is not your possession—how can you possess the Way?"
Shun said: "If my body is not mine, then whose is it?"
Cheng said: "It is the entrusted form of Heaven and Earth. Life is not your possession—it is the entrusted harmony of Heaven and Earth. Nature and destiny are not your possession—it is the entrusted compliance of Heaven and Earth. Children and grandchildren are not your possession—it is the entrusted shedding of Heaven and Earth. Thus, in walking, one does not know where one is going; in dwelling, one does not know what one is holding; in eating, one does not know the taste. It is the strong yang qi of Heaven and Earth—how can it be obtained and possessed?"

Guo’s commentary: "The body is not yours—how much less the Way! If the body were yours, then beauty, ugliness, life, and death would be determined by you. Now, qi gathers and you are born—you cannot forbid it; qi scatters and you die—you cannot stop it. Clearly, it is entrusted and self-completing, not yours. As for children and grandchildren, they are also qi entrusted and self-completing, like the shedding of a cicada. Thus, in walking, dwelling, and eating, all come within the natural. Strong yang—this is like movement. Those who understand this Way can perhaps relinquish the body and forget life."

Lü’s commentary: "Observing the things of the world, nothing is more one’s own than one’s body, yet even the entrusted form of Heaven and Earth cannot be possessed."

What clings closest to the existence of your body is none other than life, yet the entrusted harmony of Heaven and Earth—you cannot grasp its completion. What underlies your life is none other than nature and destiny, yet the entrusted compliance of Heaven and Earth—you cannot defy its rectitude.

Observe your body: if you know its root and origin, then in walking, where do you direct yourself? In dwelling, what do you hold to? In eating, what do you savor? All these are the workings of Heaven and Earth’s vigorous yang qi. Then how can you claim possession of the Way?

Du’s commentary: *Cheng* was a man of the Dao in ancient times. The body is the vessel that carries the Way, yet the body is subject to the bestowal and deprivation of Creation—thus it is not yours, but the entrusted form of Heaven and Earth. If even the body cannot be your own, how much less the Way! Not only the body, but life and nature-and-destiny are also not yours—they are the entrusted harmony and compliance of Heaven and Earth. As for children and grandchildren, they too are but its entrusted shedding. Knowing that none of these are yours, you should entrust them to the natural—thus in walking, dwelling, and eating, all proceed from the natural, and you know not how.

The vigorous yang qi of Heaven and Earth—humans receive it and are born, and by it they die. How can you claim possession of it?

Bi Xu’s commentary: The Way cannot be grasped by sight, hearing, or touch—how then can it be possessed? The body is but a lump that exists of itself—how can it be yours? The answer lies in the notion of "solitary transformation": it is entrusted and follows of itself. The body is not yours—it exists by following the form of Heaven and Earth. Life is not yours—it exists by following the harmony of Heaven and Earth. Nature-and-destiny is not yours—it exists by following the compliance of Heaven and Earth. Children and grandchildren are not yours—they exist by following the shedding of Heaven and Earth. Thus in walking, dwelling, and eating, all are stirred and set in motion by the primal qi—what part of it is yours?

Yong Zhai’s commentary: *Wei* means "to gather." The four great elements temporarily unite—this is called *entrusted form*. Yin and yang achieve harmony and things are born—this is called *entrusted harmony*. Nature-and-destiny reside within me, yet they are the principle of Creation—this is called *entrusted compliance*. Generations succeed one another like the molting of a cicada—this is called *entrusted shedding*. *Strong yang* is the qi of life. Human walking, dwelling, and eating are all set in motion by this qi, and are not one’s own. The *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* says: "Where now does this illusory body abide?"—this is the meaning. "Not knowing what to hold to" refers to primordial attachment.

*Cheng* may refer to Shun’s teacher, though few explanations are detailed. Upon further examination, Bi Xu’s *Pronunciation and Meaning* notes: "In ancient times, the emperor had four assistants: left and right counselors, a front *yi* and a rear *cheng*—these were official titles. This explanation is likely correct." The Way is originally formless and manifests through things. The body is not mine—it is numinous through spirit.

Heaven and Earth entrust form—what is formed must decay. That which is called "I" is but a temporary lodging. So too with life and nature: thus may one know that descendants are but *entrusted shedding*. Therefore, in one’s walking, dwelling, and eating, all should be left to nature.

The harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth flows and nurtures the myriad things. This flourishes while that withers; this dies while that lives—all is the operation and transformation of the Dao to its ultimate limit, and the reception of destiny by things is without end. How can you alone possess it?

For it is clear that the creative transformation of Heaven and Earth is without partiality. Only by breaking through the delusion of worldly people who cling to possession of their bodies and cherish their children and grandchildren can one enter the Dao. This is the crucial secret by which *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi] truly liberates people from their bonds.

Confucius asked Lao Dan: "Today I have leisure. May I inquire about the supreme Dao?"
Lao Dan replied: "Purify your mind through fasting, empty your heart through detachment, cleanse your spirit through stillness, and discard your knowledge. The Dao is profoundly difficult to speak of! I shall tell you its rough outline.

The luminous arises from the obscure; order arises from formlessness; spirit arises from the Dao; form arises from essence. The myriad things generate one another through form—thus creatures with nine orifices are born from the womb, and those with eight from eggs. Their coming is without origin, their going without limit; without gate, without chamber, they radiate boundlessly in all four directions.

Those who attain this have strong limbs, penetrating thoughts, keen ears and sharp eyes. Their minds do not labor, and their responses to things are without constraint. Heaven cannot but be high, Earth cannot but be vast, the sun and moon cannot but move, and the myriad things cannot but flourish—this is the Dao!

Moreover, broad learning does not necessarily bring knowledge, nor eloquence wisdom. The sage has already settled this. As for that which, when covered, is not diminished, and when uncovered, is not increased—this is what the sage preserves.

Deep as the sea, lofty in its ceaseless return to the beginning, it measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion. Then the Dao of the noble person—is it external to these? The myriad things all draw from it without depletion—this is the Dao!

There exists a being within the Central Kingdom, neither yin nor yang, dwelling between Heaven and Earth. For now, it is human, but it will return to its origin. Viewed from its root, life is but the temporary clustering of things. Though there are long and short lives, how great is the difference? It is but a momentary affair. How can it suffice to distinguish between Yao and Jie?

The fruits and ferns have their principles; human relationships, though complex, follow their own order. The sage encounters them without resistance and passes beyond without attachment. To harmonize and respond is virtue; to coincide and respond is the Dao. From this arise the rise of emperors and the founding of kings.

Human life between Heaven and Earth is like a white colt passing a gap—sudden and fleeting. Suddenly it surges forth, and none does not emerge; gently it fades away, and none does not return. Having transformed and been born, it transforms again and dies. Living things mourn it, and humankind grieves for it. Loosening its heavenly constraints, casting off its celestial endowments, in a tangle of confusion, the hun and po depart, and the body follows—thus the great return!

The formless taking form, form returning to the formless—this is what all people know, yet it is not what those who are about to attain the Dao pursue. This is what the multitude discusses in common. Those who attain it do not discuss it; those who discuss it do not attain it. Clear insight is of no value; disputation is not as good as silence. The Dao cannot be heard; hearing is not as good as blocking the senses—this is called *great attainment*."

Guo Xiang’s commentary states: "The obscure, the formless, and the Dao all clarify that it arises alone and borrows nothing. Form, then, is but essence refined to the coarsest." Though the myriad things generate one another through form, all is natural. Thus creatures born from wombs or eggs cannot produce different species—this makes clear that spirit and qi cannot be forced.

Those who follow the nature of spontaneity and wander the path without bounds cast their forms into Heaven and Earth and lodge their spirits beyond things. Thus, without gate, without chamber, they radiate boundlessly in all four directions, roaming the six directions and moving in step with transformation.

If one encounters this Dao in life, then one’s heavenly nature is whole and one’s spirit settled. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things cannot but be as they are. Therefore, the sage cuts off wisdom and entrusts all to nature, allowing each to preserve its proper place and act without limit.

Those who move with transformation use things without being enslaved by them. The Dao’s abundance lies in not seeking abundance, yet things naturally attain it—this is to say, without effort, it is truly worthy of being called the Dao. Without partial names, freely and naturally, one passes through all and is at peace, understanding that effort and fame are nothing. Those who return to the origin do not chase after ends.

Alas! Things are but the gathering of qi. Death and life are not so different—how much less so long and short lives! Things have no inherent principle; one should simply follow them. Human relationships involve the changes of knowledge and wisdom, and thus are difficult. Yet their knowledge and wisdom follow their own order; one should follow what one encounters, even if it means exceeding what is fitting.

*Harmonizing* and *coinciding* mean blending and uniting. The rise of emperors and kings is no more than this. The fleeting passage of the colt through the gap is not worth lamenting. Having been born, one dies—both are transformations. One does not mourn the death of things, nor grieve the death of humankind. Loosening skills and casting off order—this is to be uniquely free. In the misty transformations, there is no need to exert the mind.

The formless takes form, and form is completed; to pursue it is not to attain it. To be silent and block the senses is to truly gain it.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary states: "Spirit in relation to the Dao is still but the luminous. The ultimate of the supreme Dao is the obscure. When things achieve their principle of life, there is order; when their essence is most true, there is formlessness." The myriad things generate one another through form; their coming and going are without escape, and they radiate boundlessly in all four directions.

If one attains this, one rests in the depths of the myriad things. The body is strong, thoughts penetrating, and one’s use is without constraint. The completion of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things—none is not this.

The erudite is not wisdom, nor is eloquence intelligence—these the sage has already rejected. What seems gain is not gain, and what seems loss is not loss—these the sage preserves. Profound and towering, none know its bounds. There is movement and measure, yet these lie not within the Dao. The myriad things draw sustenance, yet not from without. Seeking the Dao thus, one finds where it resides.

Neither yin nor yang, it follows only the Dao. To be merely human is to be the same as others; to return to the origin is to be one with Heaven. Ugliness and beauty, life and death—all are equal; what distinction is there between Yao and Jie? The principle of melons and beans is shared by the myriad things. The order of human relations is the sequence of the Great Dao: neither violating nor adhering, neither abandoning nor grasping—this is the meaning.

Harmonizing and responding, virtue thus achieves its partial completion; coinciding and responding, the Dao neither examines nor laments. The rise of emperors and kings stems from nothing more than this Dao. Human life passes like a colt through a gap—none can halt it. Things grieve and people mourn, for they do not understand that there has never been birth, never been death. Release skill, and tension and relaxation are unbound; discard rank, and expansion and contraction are unimpeded. The hun and po depart, and the body follows. Speech does not transcend the great smelting of the formless form. The formed from the formless—this all know, yet it is not the goal they pursue. When attained, it is embodied; when unattained, it is merely discussed.

To clearly perceive the Dao is to encounter nothing, thus eloquence is inferior to silence. To truly hear the Dao is to hear nothing, thus hearing is inferior to blocking. Speaking without words, listening without hearing—this is called the great attainment.

*Yi Du’s Commentary*: With an obscure will, one achieves luminous merit; with the formless Dao, one establishes ordered affairs. Unifying is called essence; the unfathomable is called spirit. The myriad things generate one another through form, yet what enables their generation is this so-called essence. Thus, creatures born from wombs or eggs each fulfill their nature and destiny, and the subtlety of supreme essence arises naturally—coming without coming, going without going. Without gate, without chamber, it radiates boundlessly in all four directions. Those who know this Dao unify their four limbs and senses with true principle, so their use of the mind is effortless, and their response to things is unconstrained. The movements, generation, and transformation of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things likewise proceed from this.

As for those who take erudition and eloquence as wisdom, the sage has already discarded them. What is neither diminished nor augmented by gain or loss is what the sage preserves—moving with transformation without end, supplying the needs of things without lack. Things draw from it without exhaustion—all these are the functions of the Dao. Within the central realm is the sage. Neither yin nor yang, it is unfathomable. To be merely human is to encounter this form by chance, not by intent; thus, returning to the origin, one observes the transformations of things. Life is but a temporary gathering of qi—laughter and ugliness alike. All things, from melons to beans, possess the principle of nature and destiny; the hierarchy of human relations is no different. Harmonizing and responding is the virtue of Heaven; coinciding and responding is the way of man. The rise of emperors and kings stems from this, yet these are but traces of worldly response, not the sage’s wondrous use.

People dwell in the world but a fleeting moment. Birth and death alternate like day and night, yet those who follow circumstances and obscure principle grieve—bound by attachment, like a bow in its skill, a book in its binding. Only the uniquely liberated can cast these off. In the tumult of life, the hun and po do not linger; death is humanity’s return. The formless takes form—this is coming into life. The formed becomes formless—this is departing in death. This is what all people share, yet it is not the goal they pursue. It refers to the principle of life and death, which even the common people can speak of; those who attain the ultimate do not discuss it, for discussion precludes attainment. Thus, eloquence is inferior to silence, and hearing is inferior to blocking. This is to attain what cannot be attained—the great attainment.

*Bixu’s Commentary*: Yang emerges from yin, being from non-being—its principle shines clearly. Spirit is the subtle remnant of the profound; form and substance are the earthly residue of harmonious qi. Thus, the mingling of kinds is distinct, and creatures born from wombs or eggs are not alike. Its coming is unknown—who calls it continuation? Its going is unfathomable—who calls it an end? Emerging, it pervades all—where is the gate? Entering, it fills all—where is the chamber? Without lack, without excess, it pervades boundlessly. Those who encounter this profound and subtle Dao become one with Heaven, respond to things without limit, and Heaven cannot but be exalted. The four phrases all refer to the Dao; the *Hunyuan* says, "Attaining the One is this."

To seek the Dao with knowledge is to hear little; to seek it with haste is to speak haltingly.

To abandon knowledge and wisdom is what the ancients prized. What neither increase nor decrease can touch—how profound and towering it stands! That which measures and sustains the myriad things without omission first attends to its root, not relying on anything external. Thus, when things turn to it for sustenance, they never lack, for this clarifies the unchanging subtlety of the Dao—neither augmented nor diminished.

To be merely human is to embody the Dao’s countenance and Heaven’s form. To return to one’s origin is to enter the vast solitude of the One. Hah! How coarse—all that congeals into living things will, in time, scatter back into nothingness. To compare lifespans, to dispute right and wrong—these are but delusions of the heart-mind.

Even plants, devoid of feeling, still embody the principle of yin and yang. Human nature does not alter; none transgress the sequence of before and after. The sage responds when affairs arise, then forgets them once they pass. Those who would initiate undertakings invariably take harmony as virtue and resonance as the Way.

In this fleeting world, life slips away in the turn of an arm. Only the serene and still transcend all going and coming; only the unchanging transcend death and life.

To unravel skills and cast off ranks—this is the meaning of shedding growths and dissolving stagnation. In the midst of flourishing and winding transformations, one lingers between the desire to transform and its unfulfillment. When the hun and po fail to guard, the hundred bones dissolve and scatter, and the spirit returns to its true abode.

The formless takes form; the unchanging transforms all transformations. The formed remains unformed; the transformer of things does not transform. The coarse belongs to form, known to all; those who attain the Dao forget both coarse and subtle.

In speech, one merely utters its dregs, never touching the essence—thus, hearing stops at the ear, and one mistakes not-gaining for gaining. Master Yongzhai said: With order, the myriad things can be distinguished. The formless is creation. Spirit and essence reside within humans. The myriad things arise through form, and both humans and creatures exist within it. Though humans are nobler than other beings, their arising is the same.

The gate and chamber of the formless cannot be sought—how then can one know its going and coming? If one seeks afar and glimpses this Dao, the body finds peace, thoughts become clear, and responses to things are without contrivance. From heaven and earth to the myriad things—these four phrases describe penetrating above and below, yet none of this is the Dao.

People boast of their erudition as ability, unaware that what enables their wisdom is the Creator. Thus, the sage severs ties with creation, neither taking increase as increase nor decrease as decrease. What is preserved lies within me; external things cannot add to it. Ending returns to beginning, responding to things without exhaustion—yet one remains bound by intention and description. When things pass and draw from it without depletion, then there is no mind and no striving.

Neither yin nor yang, it cannot be named by things. Though one bears human form, if the heart advances toward things from the outset, one merely lodges a form between heaven and earth. The origin is the beginning of things. Hah! How coarse—when qi does not flow smoothly. Viewing the formed from its primordial origin, it is but a burden.

Within a hundred years, compared to heaven and earth, it is but a spark. Even the smallest fruit or fern has its season of growth and its kind of sprouting—this is the principle of nature. Human relationships involve the restraint of superiors and inferiors, the oppression of the strong over the weak, yet all dwell together in the world, arrayed side by side. To not oppose is to follow; to not guard is to transform. Harmony and resonance are the natural course of virtue and the Dao.

The rise of emperors and kings does not exceed this principle. Birth and death—what departs extends, what arrives contracts—this is what the *Yi* calls "exhausting the spirit and knowing transformation." Things arise from the formless and, in death, return to the formless. The principle is the same, yet humans grieve for themselves—this is because they are shrouded and unclear, as if bound in a net. To awaken is to unravel the net and cast off the shroud.

Flourishing and winding describe its transformations. The great return is the reversion to the true abode. The formless form is the unseen; the formed formlessness contains the unseen within. What Buddhists call the *dharmakāya*, which abides eternally and does not perish—this is known to all, yet none can depart from form to attain it. Those who seek the ultimate must go beyond such matters.

To reach the ultimate is beyond discourse; to discourse is not to reach it—this speaks of a yet higher level. To see and encounter is called "value," but this is a trace-bound seeing. The Dao cannot be sought through form or path, thus it is without value. Therefore, disputation is inferior to silence, and hearing is inferior to obstruction.

Brightness arises from darkness; form ultimately arises from essence. This reveals that all under heaven arises from the formless. The myriad things arise through form—this is the meaning of "one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three." Coming and going have no gate, yet all is open and vast—there is no gate. Thoughts and considerations circulate, yet ears and eyes are keen—there is no use.

Heaven, earth, and the myriad things arise from this—how great is the Dao’s function! People merely take petty erudition as wisdom and seek to align with the great Dao, yet the sage has already rejected it. Thus, the opening of this chapter first commands the abandonment of knowledge and thought, then reveals that one must reach a state where worldly gains and losses cannot affect it. Profound and towering, it begins and ends the myriad things, measures all without omission, and carves and polishes forms without artifice.

Things pass and draw from it without depletion, for it is inexhaustible and meets all demands. Is this not the Dao?

Within the Middle Kingdom there is one who is neither yin nor yang, whose words transcend life and death, unbound by their constraints. Merely existing as a human, possessing human form yet devoid of human passions—this is called returning to the origin, roaming in the primordial state of things.

Human life is but the coagulation of a single qi, though longevity and brevity differ in degree, all is but a fleeting moment—how then can one distinguish the right and wrong of Yao and Jie? Observe how even the lowly fruit and fern, though small, flourish in their kinds, each following its own order. The hierarchy of human relations, from noble to base, high to low, is likewise so.

Thus, the sage meets things and follows their nature without resistance; when they pass, they are forgotten, leaving no trace in the heart. Whether called harmony or accord, these are but wondrous responses to things, never departing from the bounds of Dao and virtue—this is what gives rise to emperors and kings, what the people rely upon.

The emergence and recession of things follow their constant principle, yet世 people cannot escape sorrow. They remain entangled in the artifices of nature; if one illuminates this with principle, the entanglement dissolves of itself. When the spirit departs, the body follows—this is the great return, what cause is there for grief?

The formless takes form and emerges into life; form returns to the formless and enters into death. This is not some abstruse matter approaching in obscurity, but a truth universally acknowledged. Yet when principle reaches its apex, words are forgotten; where words suffice, principle has not yet been attained. Thus, eloquence is inferior to silence, hearing is inferior to obstruction. In obstruction and silence lies the great attainment, and from this, the loss in eloquence and hearing becomes evident.

Measuring and sustaining the myriad things without exhaustion, the azure void illumines and disperses all. The manuscript of Liu Deyi reads "without omission," which carries greater meaning.

*Beginning of the sixty-eighth scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin comments on *Knowing Northward Travels*, Third Chapter

Dongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi, "Where does the so-called Dao reside?"
Zhuangzi replied, "There is nowhere it does not reside."
Dongguo Zi said, "You must specify before it can be accepted."
Zhuangzi said, "It resides in the ant."
Dongguo Zi asked, "Why so lowly?"
Zhuangzi said, "It resides in the millet stalk."
Dongguo Zi asked, "Why even lower?"
Zhuangzi said, "It resides in the roof tile."
Dongguo Zi asked, "Why still lower?"
Zhuangzi said, "It resides in excrement and urine."
Dongguo Zi did not respond.

Zhuangzi said, "Your question fundamentally fails to reach the essence. When the swine inspector asked the market supervisor about treading on pigs to assess their fatness, the more he trod upon the harder-to-fatten parts, the better he understood the key to the pig’s fatness. Now, you ask where the Dao resides, yet with each increasingly base example, you clarify that the Dao does not flee from things. If you insist that the Dao must escape from things, then the Dao is not all-encompassing. If one wanders within the realm of ‘what is,’ one cannot achieve universal completion.

When we join in discussion and agree that the Dao is nowhere absent, we can then roam boundlessly with an open mind, all without deliberate action. Serene and still! Vast and clear! Harmonious and at ease! My will is empty, and I go nowhere without knowing where I arrive. Departing and returning, I know not where I rest; I have come and gone without knowing where it ends. Wandering in the boundless expanse, great knowledge enters yet knows not where it reaches its limit.

That which gives things their thingness has no boundary with things, yet things have boundaries—this is what we call the boundary of things. The boundaryless boundary is the boundary of the unbounded. We speak of fullness and emptiness, growth and decline, yet that which brings about fullness and emptiness is not itself fullness or emptiness; that which brings about growth and decline is not itself growth or decline; that which brings about root and branch is not itself root or branch; that which brings about accumulation and dispersal is not itself accumulation or dispersal."

Guo Xiang’s commentary: "To point to its form and substance, saying there is nowhere the Dao does not reside, yet still asking this, is to fail to reach the essence. The market supervisor’s method of treading on pigs to know their fatness lies in treading more upon the harder-to-fatten parts to grasp the essentials of the pig’s fatness. Now, asking where the Dao resides and descending to increasingly base examples makes clear that the Dao does not flee from things. If one insists that the Dao must escape from things, then the Dao is not all-encompassing. If one wanders within the realm of ‘what is,’ one cannot achieve universal completion.

When we join in discussion and agree that the Dao is nowhere absent, we can then roam boundlessly with an open mind—this is all without deliberate action. Empty and serene, the will is empty, and thus there is nowhere it does not go; hence, one knows not where it arrives. If there is going, then principle has not yet stirred while the will has already been startled. Yet going and coming do not depend on knowledge; it is not that there is no going and coming. Going and coming are the natural constant principle—how could they have an end?

‘Boundless expanse’ refers to vast emptiness. Great knowledge wanders in the vast emptiness, following the course of transformations without restraint, hence knowing no limit. That which gives things their thingness is no-thing, while things are themselves things—thus they are obscure! Things have boundaries, so they do not obscure one another; this is the true boundary. The boundaryless means that though there is the name of ‘giving things their thingness,’ it merely clarifies that things are themselves things. Yet that which gives things their thingness is ultimately no-thing—where then is its boundary? Having clarified that which gives things their thingness is no-thing, and that things cannot be themselves by themselves, then who is the doer? All is suddenly and naturally so.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: "The ant has knowledge yet is most minute; the millet stalk has no knowledge yet has life; the roof tile has no life yet has form; excrement and urine have form yet are foul and decayed. If the Dao can be in such things, then it is clear the Dao is nowhere absent. To expect the Dao to reside in these four is to grasp its essence; to deem them increasingly base and question further is to fail to reach the essence. The method of treading on pigs—each descent reveals more—so if one expects the Dao to descend further, is this not increasingly far from its essence? Yet to insist that the Dao must escape from things is not the way to understand that the Dao is nowhere absent.

Though the four examples differ, none fully embodies the Dao’s essence, just as words may be all-encompassing yet their meaning is one. Wandering in the Palace of Nothing-What-Is and finding agreement, how could these four not be the Dao? Though the myriad things arise together, if we join in non-action, then in serenity, vastness, harmony, and ease, all return to their root, empty and still.

If my will does not chase after things, then I go nowhere without knowing where I arrive; departing and returning, I know not where I rest; coming and going, I know not where it ends—this is the Dao’s never having had things, and things’ never having been the Dao! Thus, wandering in the boundless expanse, great knowledge enters yet knows not where it reaches its limit. From this, we know that which gives things their thingness has no boundary with things; great and small cannot be distinguished.

Things with boundaries are what we call the boundary of things—they are not that which gives things their thingness. The boundaryless boundary is the boundary of the unbounded, like the formless form and the form that is formless. Fullness and emptiness are things; that which brings about fullness and emptiness is the Dao. The same applies to growth and decline, root and branch, accumulation and dispersal. Then who brings about the millet stalk, the ant, the roof tile, excrement and urine? Who is it?"

Du’s commentary: "The more noble and exalted, the farther from the Dao; the baser and lower, the closer to the Dao. The world often overlooks the lowly and base, not realizing that seeking the Dao is closest here. This aligns with the Chan saying that ‘the Buddha is at the head of the dung heap.’

The market supervisor’s method of treading on pigs to know their fatness lies in treading more upon the harder-to-fatten parts to grasp the essentials. Now, asking where the Dao resides and descending to increasingly base examples makes clear that the Dao does not flee from things. If one insists that the Dao must escape from base things, then the Dao is not all-encompassing.

The supreme Dao disperses and resides in things, becoming principle; great words disperse and reside in people, becoming teaching. All-encompassing, it is not lacking; universal, it is not partial; complete, it is without bias. This illustrates that the Dao is nowhere absent. Though the three names differ, their reality is one."

Still and serene, this describes its essence aligning with the heart;
Vast and clear, this describes the heart aligning with qi;
Harmonized and spaced, this describes qi aligning with spirit;
Void my will, and spirit aligns with emptiness.

Thus, it goes forth without awareness, and what should arrive arrives of itself;
Coming and going without knowing where it halts, it halts of itself;
I traverse to and fro without knowing its end—this is the principle of spontaneity.

Therefore, wandering in the boundless expanse of the empty wilds, great knowledge enters therein yet knows no limit—this is the power to master all things. One who masters all things becomes one with things, without boundary.

Boundary is the shore’s edge. Where things have boundaries, that is called the boundary of things. As the Śākya says: "The anterior and posterior boundaries"—this is the boundary of what has no boundary. The master of all things achieves this, so though there is boundary, it is as if there were none. The bounded belongs to things; the unbound resides in the self. Having clarified that the master of all things has no boundary, and that things cannot master themselves, then who is the agent? All occurs suddenly and of itself.

Fullness and emptiness, decline and decay, root and branch, accumulation and dispersal—all these lie in that; what have I to do with them? With an empty heart, one merely observes the transformations of yin and yang.

Master Bixu notes: "It fundamentally fails to grasp the essence." The question posed misses its fundamental source, hence the analogy of the market supervisor treading on pigs—if there is flesh beneath the wrist, one knows the pig is fat above. The body of the Dao is empty and boundless; where is it not present? Since it does not flee from things, neither do things flee from it. The Dao makes no distinction between purity and filth; words, too, transcend the coarse and the refined. Thus, it pervades the Great Clarity and extends to all things, universally nurturing them—like the subtle traces of Fuxi and Shennong, which elude definition, merging into oneness.

Roaming the palace of "nothing whatsoever," if there were something, it would not be all-encompassing. Discussing unity, if there were an end, it would not be universal. Acting together without contrivance, if there were contrivance, it would not be complete.

Stillness, vastness, harmony, and spacing—these are the daily practices of the Daoist, merely emptying the will. Unaware of where it reaches, it is all-encompassing; unaware of where it halts, it is universal; unaware of its end, it is complete. Wandering in boundless expanse without knowing its limit—this transcends knowledge and thought.

The body of the Dao has no boundary; in transforming things, it too has no boundary. Boundaries exist in things, not in the Dao. The unbound is without boundary, thus it can contain all boundaries. If it had boundaries, it could not contain the boundless.

The Dao has names of fullness and emptiness, yet lacks their reality; things have processes of decline and decay, yet lack their principle. The Dao’s transformations have root and branch, yet its body transcends root and branch; things have forms of accumulation and dispersal, yet their nature transcends accumulation and dispersal. From this, we know that Dao and things never flee from one another, and their wondrous function is nowhere absent.

Master Fu Zhai says: "Essence is the root. Your question does not reach the root, hence my words descend further. If you cling to fixed notions, the ultimate principles of things will all elude you." The three terms—all-encompassing, universal, complete—illustrate that things have no coarse or fine; their principle is one.

The palace of "nothing whatsoever" reveals the will’s freedom from fixed notions. Discussing unity, if there were coarse and fine, how could there be no end? Stillness, clarity, harmony, and spacing all describe the wondrousness of non-action. To investigate this to the point of emptiness and oneness is to fulfill my aspiration—hence, "void my will." *Yi* here is read as *already*.

Having no going forth, how could there be an arrival? Though there is coming and going, there is no halting. I traverse to and fro yet know not its end, only seeing it wander into the realm of great knowledge without limit.

Great knowledge is the Dao’s oneness with things, transforming together—what does not become a thing is able to master all things. Not transformed with things, there are boundaries and limits—this is the boundary of things. Reaching the limitless is to be unbound by the boundaries of things. Attaining the unbound is to grasp the boundary of the unbound. The fullness and emptiness, flourishing and decay, root and branch, gathering and dispersal of things all seem to proceed without end—this is the boundary of the unbound, the unbound of boundaries.

The Dao in the world is like water in the earth, its body and nature pervading and universal. Here, the Dao is said to reside in tiles and mortises, pointing to its lowest manifestations. Extending by analogy, one knows it pervades all places—what thing does not possess this Dao? Yet human capacities differ, and perceptions vary. The sage sees the Dao and not things; the common person sees things and not the Dao. It is the obstruction of things, not the Dao’s presence or absence.

Your question is crude and fails to grasp the Dao’s true essence, falling short even of the pig-treader who knows the essentials of fatness. If you claim the Dao flees from base things, it cannot be all-encompassing, universal, or complete. Merging these three and roaming the realm of "nothing whatsoever," how could there be any limit?

The states of stillness, clarity, harmony, and spacing ultimately return to quiescence. My will goes forth without knowing its destination—like spirit wandering the eight directions, where intent arrives instantly—even to the point of not knowing where it halts, not knowing its end, all describing the inexhaustible function of this Dao.

The master of all things is the Dao. To be without boundary with things is to give life to the myriad beings. Yet things have boundaries—their own limits—this is what is called boundary. How could the Dao have boundaries? The boundary of the unbound is the Dao dispersing into things. The unbound of boundaries is things returning whole to the Dao.

The Dao disperses into things, and transformation follows naturally, like a source flowing into streams.

Whole things return to the Dao, yet the return is difficult—like streams flowing back to the source, compelled by necessity. If one awakens to the fact that what fills and empties is not truly filling and emptying, that what accumulates and disperses is not truly accumulating and dispersing, then how can one know the extremity of necessity without returning to the natural?

Kehé Gān and Shennong studied together under Old Dragon Ji. Shennong, secluded in his humble abode, shut his door and slept through the day. At noon, Kehé Gān pushed open the door and entered, saying: "Old Dragon is dead!" Shennong, leaning on his staff, rose abruptly, then cast it aside with a burst of laughter, saying: "Heaven knew my perversity and arrogance, so it cast me aside and let him die. Alas, Master! You died for the wild words I provoked!" Qin Gang, hearing this, remarked: "Those who embody the Dao are the ones upon whom the noble of the world depend. Yet even one who has grasped but a ten-thousandth part of a hair’s tip of the Dao still knew to conceal his wild words and die—how much more so for those who truly embody it!"

To see without form, to hear without sound—such is called the obscure and dark. This is how one speaks of the Dao, yet it is not the Dao. Then Tai Qing asked Yuan Qiong: "Do you know the Dao?" Yuan Qiong replied: "I do not know." He then asked Yuan Wei. Yuan Wei said: "I know the Dao." Tai Qing asked: "Does your knowledge of the Dao have a pattern?" Yuan Wei replied: "It does." "What is its pattern?" Yuan Wei said: "I know the Dao can be noble, can be base, can be gathered, can be dispersed—this is the pattern by which I know it." Tai Qing then asked Yuan Shi: "If so, then between Yuan Qiong’s not-knowing and Yuan Wei’s knowing, which is right and which is wrong?" Yuan Shi said: "Not-knowing is profound; knowing is shallow. Not-knowing is internal; knowing is external."

Thereupon Tai Qing sighed and said: "Is not-knowing then knowing? Is knowing then not-knowing? Who knows the knowing of not-knowing?" Yuan Shi said: "The Dao cannot be heard—what is heard is not it. The Dao cannot be seen—what is seen is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken—what is spoken is not it. Do you understand that the shaper of forms is itself formless? The Dao should not be named."

Yuan Shi continued: "One who answers when asked about the Dao does not know it. Even the one who asks does not hear the Dao. The Dao is without question, and questions yield no answer. To question without questioning is to exhaust inquiry; to answer without answering is to lack inner attainment. Responding to exhausted inquiry with inner emptiness—such a one neither observes the cosmos outwardly nor knows the Great Beginning inwardly. Thus, he does not pass beyond Kunlun nor wander the Great Void."

Guo’s commentary: He awoke to the fact that death is not worth alarm, so he cast aside his staff and laughed. From Jianwu downward, all took the ultimate words as madness and did not believe them. Those who embody the Dao are the lords of humanity, yet the Dao cannot be attained through words—it lies in self-realization. Even the obscure and dark are not the Dao; the clarity of the Dao is beyond naming. True attainment does not come from knowing but from obscurity. Only by dwelling in the realm of no-hearing and no-seeing does one reach it. Form shapes itself, yet the shaper of forms is ultimately nothing. To name the Dao is to name nothing, for names cannot capture it.

Not-knowing leads to questioning; without response, inquiry yields nothing, so in the end, nothing is heard. Without question, without answer—this is the abandonment of learning and teaching, the return to the natural. Yet to press with questions is to demand the empty, to impose the unreal upon what is truly without substance. As for those who roam the vastness of heaven and earth, traversing the distant void to enter the obscure and dark—they do not respond, and that is all.

Lü’s commentary: Those who embody the Dao are the ones upon whom the noble of the world depend, for sagehood and kingship alike are tied to it. Yet even one who has grasped but a ten-thousandth part of a hair’s tip of the Dao—whose essence is so refined it cannot be divided, what is called "attaining the One"—still knew to conceal his wild words and die. How much more so for one who embodies the Dao, where the myriad transformations have never begun to have an end? Old Dragon Ji concealed his wild words and died precisely because the Dao, as a thing, cannot be reached by sight or hearing. What people discuss as the obscure and dark is not the Dao, for the Dao cannot be discussed through words. Tai Qing, hearing that discussing the Dao is not the Dao, sought answers from Yuan Qiong, yet Yuan Qiong did not know. Yuan Wei was not originally Yuan Wei; he knew that what was not sufficient to be called "knowing" was not knowing, and thus he knew it. Otherwise, all would be the same mystery.

To know that the Dao can be noble or base, gathered or dispersed, is still bound by patterns. Yuan Shi, however, reached the very origin of the beginning, and thus knew that not-knowing is profound while knowing is shallow; not-knowing is internal while knowing is external. Tai Qing sighed in the middle, saying: "Not-knowing is knowing—Yuan Qiong is right. Knowing is not-knowing—Yuan Wei is right. Who knows the knowing of not-knowing? Only Yuan Shi." The Dao cannot be heard, seen, or spoken. What is heard, seen, or spoken—who is that? Only after form arises does name come. To know the shaper of forms is to know the formless—this is why the Dao should not be named. Thus, what is heard is not hearing, what is seen is not seeing, what is spoken is not speaking.

To answer when asked is not to know the Dao. Even the one who asks has not heard the Dao. The Dao is without question, for the questioner cannot attain it. To answer without answering is to lack response, for the responder cannot attain it. All is as if nothing had ever begun. To question without questioning is to exhaust inquiry, yet one does not know that it is exhausted and so questions in vain. To answer without answering is to lack inner attainment, for one has not grasped the absence of things within. To meet exhausted inquiry with inner emptiness is to neither observe the cosmos outwardly nor know the Great Beginning inwardly—thus, one is not bound by time or place.

Beyond Kunlun’s bounds, beyond the Great Void’s expanse—only then does one know the height of form, and that heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things are contained within it.

*Dúzhù* notes: To embody the Dao is to become one with it, not merely to study or comprehend it. Without form, without sound—this is called "level" and "subtle."

When people discuss it, they call it "obscure obscurity." Yet to speak of the Dao in such terms is still not the Dao. What can be valued or debased, gathered or dispersed—these are the Dao’s manifestations. What cannot be valued or debased, gathered or dispersed—this is the Dao’s essence. To speak not, to know not, is to perceive its root; thus it is said, "Who knows the knowledge of the unknowing?"

The Dao is without sound, without color, without name—thus it cannot be seen, heard, or spoken. Yet where sounds, colors, and names exist, knowing that forms are formless reveals that the Dao should not be named. Therefore, the questioner is fundamentally mistaken, and the responder is likewise not correct. One who asks about the Dao has not yet known it—how much less one who answers? Exhausted inquiry met with inner emptiness is better than questioning and responding. To answer with non-answering, to respond to non-questioning—is this not the work of the spirit? Thus, outwardly not observing the vastness of the cosmos, inwardly not knowing the subtlety of the Great Beginning, not passing beyond Kunlun is to transcend earth, not roaming the Great Void is to depart from heaven—who but the supremely spiritual can attain this?

*Bìxū* notes: All under heaven’s noble ones are bound to it, for the Dao is the teacher of a hundred kings. Now, if even the minutest detail of the Dao is known to be hidden, how much more its fullness! The profound and obscure lie beyond the reach of ears and eyes. To discuss the Dao in such terms is still not the Dao; thus, when Taiqing asked about non-exhaustion, non-exhaustion replied with "not knowing." To know is to be limited. Again, he asked about non-action, and non-action replied that to know it is to be noble when attaining the Dao, base when losing it; to hold it is restraint, to release it is dispersion—these are the Dao’s manifestations. Not knowing is profound and internal—this is the nameless constant Dao, the subtlety of principle. Knowing is shallow and external—this is the named "Dao that can be spoken," the entanglement of affairs. To engage in discourse when questioned is to stray into description—how can one know the subtle? Thus, one who asks about the Dao has not heard it; to have heard is not to ask. Non-questioning and non-answering are like the waters of the Zī and Miǎn—easy to discuss, yet their sweet and bitter tastes are hard to convey. To question without knowing is non-questioning; to question non-questioning is to be confounded by principle. To answer without knowing is non-answering; to answer non-answering is to lack inner attainment. To illuminate with inner emptiness, to respond to confounded questioning, is like debating the scattering of years with the blind or discussing tones with the deaf—how can one know the vastness of the cosmos, the solitude of the Great Beginning, the loftiness of Kunlun, the remoteness of the Great Void?

*Yōngzhāi* says: One who embodies the Dao becomes the source to which all under heaven’s noble ones return. Now, if even Shennong, who had not yet perceived the Dao, knew to conceal the wild words of Old Dragon upon his death, how much more one who embodies the Dao and is one with Old Dragon? "Wild" here means "great," for the Dao resides in non-speech; to conceal one’s words is thus to preserve the Dao. The Dao is without form or sound, beyond seeing or hearing. To discuss it with others, calling it "obscure obscurity," is still not the Dao—this is the meaning of "the speaker does not know." Form and sound exist; obscurity does not. To know existence as non-existence is not as good as making both existence and non-existence non-existent. Thus, Shennong’s words still do not reach the Dao. Nobility and baseness, union and dispersion—these are the Dao’s measurable aspects. The "knowledge of the unknowing" is the subtlety beyond naming. That forms are formless is to say that non-thingness can thing all things. The Dao should not be named, nor should it be opposed. To name the Dao is to set name and Dao in opposition, departing from their original truth. The Dao is fundamentally non-questioning; to question and answer is to depart from it, and the questioner’s inquiry is likewise not the Dao. "Exhausted inquiry" means one’s understanding is limited to questioning, clinging to words in pursuit of knowledge. "Inner emptiness" means the heart has not attained the Dao; if it had, one would not respond. This chapter clarifies that the Dao is so vast it cannot be exhausted by question and answer. Sages and worthies, in this regard, remain silent to the end. Humans dwell among the ten thousand things, no more than a hair’s tip within them. To embody the Dao is likewise so. Thus, when Old Dragon died, Shennong arose to deceive—what *Taotang Diao* calls "embodying the Dao" refers precisely to Old Dragon, hidden yet manifest. The world takes what lies beyond seeing and hearing as the obscurity of the Dao, but this is not to know the Dao. They see the Dao’s nothingness but have not yet attained the nothingness of nothingness.

Qin Qing asked about the boundless, but the boundless cannot be known. He then asked about non-action, and non-action is merely the reckoning of knowing the Dao. Next, he asked about the beginningless, and the beginningless definitively distinguishes the depth and shallowness, the inner and outer of knowing and not knowing—this echoes the Yellow Emperor’s words at the chapter’s outset: "Not knowing is true; forgetting comes next; knowing is farthest from it." Thereupon, Tai Qing, centered yet deluded, claimed to know the knowledge of not-knowing, asserting that one need not seek knowledge to naturally accord with the Dao. The beginningless then awakened to the fact that the Dao cannot be grasped through hearing or seeing, through words or forms.

That which takes form from the formless—just as the living arise from life—means the Dao cannot be named. Thus, both questioner and respondent have yet to hear the Dao; if they had heard it, they would not ask, nor would they respond. To question where the Dao admits no question is to exhaust the Dao through questioning. To respond where there is no response is to lack inner grounding—how then could one know that which is greatest, earliest, highest, and most vast?

"Centered yet deluded" (*zhong er qi*)—the explanation does not cohere, and the meaning should instead be *yin* (印), as in the *Book of Songs*: "Gazing up at the vast sky" (*zhan yin hao tian*), where *yin* is interchangeable with *yang* (仰), a scribal error. *The Ocean of Meanings in the True Scripture of Southern Florescence*, Scroll Sixty-Eight, concludes. *The Ocean of Meanings in the True Scripture of Southern Florescence*, Scroll Sixty-Nine.

The Wulin Daoist Chu Boxiu’s *Knowing the Northern Journey*, Chapter Four

Guangyao asked Wu You, “Master, do you *have*? Or do you *have not*?” Guangyao could not frame his question, so he observed Wu You’s appearance—profoundly empty, utterly void. All day he looked but saw nothing, listened but heard nothing, grasped but held nothing.

Guangyao said, “This is perfection! Who could attain such a state? I can *have nothing*, yet I cannot *have no-having*. And if one *is* Wu You, how could one reach this?”

Guo’s commentary: This expresses the meaning of cutting off learning. When one severs it through the Dao, then the learner returns to the root. Thus, the best learning is precisely non-learning.

Lü’s commentary: Guangyao is the radiance of the great expanse, shining and illuminating. Wu You is without illumination. This is why Guangyao cannot discern whether he *has* or *has not*, and why his question remains unanswered. Profoundly empty, utterly void—beyond sight, hearing, or touch—this is what it means to be Wu You. Only because he *has nothing* is he Guangyao; because he cannot *have no-having*, he has not yet become Wu You. When one *is* Wu You, there is nowhere to reach—how could one attain this?

Yi Du’s commentary: Guangyao is the name for luminous knowing. Wu You is one who embodies the Dao. To embody the Dao is to be beyond seeking through sound, form, or name. Yet these three merge into one—its essence is nowhere absent, nowhere distinct. Thus, Guangyao marvels, “Who could attain this?”—meaning it admits no further addition.

Bixu’s commentary: Guangyao symbolizes inner illumination. Wu You symbolizes the wondrous root. Inner illumination embodies the wondrous root. If one says it *has*, it is profoundly empty; if one says it *has not*, it *has nothing* yet cannot *have no-having*. To discuss *non-being* while debating *being* is to multiply endlessly; to sever *being* and cut off *non-being*—how then could one awaken to the wondrous? Subtle indeed! Guangyao’s question is the great purport of *Knowing the Northern Journey*.

Yongzhai’s note: “You can *have nothing*, yet you cannot *have no-having*”—this saying is most wondrous. “Cannot *have no-having*” means I still dwell within the word *nothing*, am possessed by the word *nothing*—how could one reach profound emptiness? The *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* says: “To speak of *non-enlightenment* is likewise so.” *Non-enlightenment* may be called wondrous, yet it is still deemed incomplete—its meaning is the same as here.

The old smith of Great Ma, though eighty years old, never missed a hair’s breadth in hammering hooks. Great Ma said, “Is it skill? Or is it the Dao?” The smith replied, “Your servant has his *guard*.”

The servant, at twenty years of age, delighted in forging hooks, seeing nothing else in the world—nothing but hooks did he observe. What he employed was but the semblance of non-employment, thereby perpetually securing its use. How much more so for that which employs nothing at all! What thing does not draw sustenance from it?

Guo’s annotation: In grasping the weight of hammer and hook, he discerned the subtlest discrepancy in hair’s breadth. When all is held in primordial embrace, things come forth and all respond.

Lü’s annotation: Non-employment and employment are one—only the Dao is thus.

Yi Du’s annotation: Great Ma was the Grand Marshal of Chu, who had a craftsman skilled in forging silver belt-hooks. Though aged, his art remained precise, so the Marshal suspected him of either skill or the Dao. His reply—“not the Dao”—meant that with inner steadfastness, external things could not disturb him. From youth he had loved this craft, seeing nothing else, observing nothing but the belt-hook. This was the source of his mastery. For when the mind is fixed here, it is not fixed there; thus this grows ever more refined. What is employed borrows from what is not employed, thereby perpetually securing its use. That which employs nothing is the Dao. What thing does not draw sustenance from it? Skill lies in the precision of knowing—if even this precision is thus, how much more the precision of the Dao?

Bixu’s annotation: The Dao resides in steadfastness alone. Without observation or guard, all is without use. Whatever is employed here is not employed there—what is employed borrows from what is not employed. Borrowing non-employment as employment, one perpetually secures its use. He who governs the myriad things employs nothing, thus his use draws sustenance.

Yongzhai says: “Observing nothing but the hook” is what was earlier called “knowing only the cicada’s wing.” Employment is skill; non-employment is the Dao’s spontaneity. That which employs nothing is the Dao’s acting without acting. I employ the marvel of non-employment in skill, thereby perpetually securing its use—how much more the Dao’s non-acting and not non-acting! What in the world does not depend on it?

Guangyao’s analogy speaks of one learning the Dao, whose mind’s blossoms first awaken to illumination—without fixed patterns, it diminishes to non-acting. Naturally, he cannot ask questions, for he abides in soundless emptiness, where seeing and hearing grasp nothing. Guangyao, just awakened, marvels at the Dao’s perfection: “What cultivation brings one to this?” Like the River Earl gazing at the Sea Lord, he stands in awe.

“You can *have nothing*” means knowing all dharmas are empty, thus this Dao alone is clear. Yet one still sits within *nothing*, not yet reaching the realm of double mystery. Now that you have attained *non-having*, how did you come to this? Deeply he admires what he cannot attain.

In forging hooks, one sees nothing else, employs nothing—this is what the world calls “non-employment in use.” Observing nothing but the hook is the precision of one’s own employment—this is what is called “having nothing in use.” As for non-employment, is this not the very meaning of *nothingness*?

All things under heaven are born of *having*; *having* is born of *nothingness*. *Having* and *nothingness* reveal each other, so what thing does not draw sustenance from them? *Nothingness* as a thing is soundless, empty, most difficult to describe—yet the Dao’s marvelous establishment, its most divine operation, truly depends on this. Worldly people cling to *having*, not knowing that it arises from *nothingness* and returns to *nothingness*. Thus the perfected often establish teachings to shatter worldly attachments, revealing the beginning and end of the myriad things. If one truly stills the mind to seek it, forgets to grasp it, all existence becomes empty, and the One Reality alone appears—then one knows that “employing the semblance of non-employment to perpetually secure its use” is no empty word. When it comes to *non-having*, all texts concur, but upon careful examination of the scriptural intent, it should be *nothingness*—the preceding text clarifies this.

Ran Qiu asked Confucius: “Can one know what existed before heaven and earth?”
Confucius said: “One can. The past is like the present.”
Ran Qiu, having asked amiss, withdrew. The next day he returned and said: “Yesterday I asked whether one could know what existed before heaven and earth. You said, ‘One can. The past is like the present.’ Yesterday I was clear, but today I am confused. May I ask what this means?”
Confucius said: “Yesterday’s clarity was received by the spirit; today’s confusion comes from seeking it with what is not spirit. There is no past, no present, no beginning, no end. Can there be grandchildren before there are children?”
Ran Qiu did not respond.
Confucius said: “Enough! No answer is fitting. One does not use life to give birth to death, nor death to give birth to life. Do life and death depend on each other? All share the same body. Is there something that existed before heaven and earth? That which gives rise to things is not a thing. Things cannot emerge before things—yet there are things. There are things, yet *nothingness* remains. The sage’s love for others never ceases, for he takes this as his model.”

Guo’s annotation: Confucius speaks of heaven and earth as ever-abiding, even before their existence. With an empty mind awaiting destiny, the spirit receives it. To seek through thought only leads to greater confusion. Not only can *nothingness* not transform into *having*, but *having* also cannot transform into *nothingness*. Thus *having* as a thing, though it undergoes a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, cannot become *nothingness* even once. Therefore, from ancient times before existence, it has always abided. “Children and grandchildren” means generation after generation without end. The dead are simply transformed by death, not given death by the living; the living are simply transformed by life. Life and death do not depend on each other—they transform independently, each forming its own body. Who, then, existed before things? If I say yin and yang existed before things, yin and yang are themselves things—who, then, existed before yin and yang? If I say nature existed before things, nature is simply the self-so of things. If I say the supreme Dao existed before things, the Dao is the ultimate *nothingness*—if it is already *nothingness*, what could exist before it? Who, then, existed before things?

Yet there remains something—*nothingness* already being so—this reveals the self-so of things, not that anything causes them to be so. The sage who loves others without end likewise draws from this self-so, thus their kindness flows through a hundred generations without ceasing.

**Lü’s Annotation:** Who named Heaven and Earth? To know how Heaven and Earth are named is to know how they came to be; to know how they came to be is to recognize that before Heaven and Earth existed, it was already as it is now. The spirit first receives this—not through thought, but by attainment. And yet it seeks for the unspiritual; this is why it is unspiritual.

From ancient to modern, from beginning to end, all things arise in mutual dependence—without dependence, all would be *nothingness*. If one grasps this, then one knows what is meant by "before Heaven and Earth existed." If what existed before Heaven and Earth can be known, then one may also know that before descendants existed, there were already descendants. To demand a response is to wish that one not seek with a mind already fixed. For the mind conceives of life and only then can it conceive of death; the mind conceives of death and only then can it conceive of life—this is the error of seeking with a mind already fixed.

Do life and death depend on each other? The body’s essence is without dependence. Where there is dependence or lack of dependence, each has its own unity. To know that life and death form a single body—how then could there be something that existed before Heaven and Earth? That which existed before Heaven and Earth would itself be a thing that gives rise to things. But that which gives rise to things is not a thing—thus no thing can emerge before things. What is called "the undifferentiated thing that existed before Heaven and Earth" is merely the existence of a thing; the existence of a thing is already *nothingness*. It speaks of that which never yet had a thing.

The sage’s love for others, which never ends, likewise draws from this. This is how Qian’s *power* governs Heaven, and how the noble person embodies it to lead others.

**Yi Du’s Annotation:** Can what existed before Heaven and Earth truly be known? By inferring from what exists after Heaven and Earth, it can be known. *Xunzi* says: "The Way of the hundred kings is present in the later kings; a thousand years ago is like today." Thus Confucius replied to Ran Qiu: "The ancient is like the present." At first, Ran Qiu asked with an empty mind—emptiness gives rise to spirit, so he was enlightened. Later, upon hearing the words, he failed to comprehend, for his mind was obstructed by something, and the unspiritual took residence, so he became confused. Confucius again taught him that there is no ancient or modern, no beginning or end—speaking in terms of spirit. Before descendants exist, one should not hastily claim to possess them. Originally, there was no death—death arises from life; originally, there was no life—life arises from death. Life and death each have their own unity and do not depend on each other.

The Great Simplicity is before qi is seen. It is neither form nor qi, and thus it can give rise to things. That which gives rise to things is not a thing. If one takes it to be a thing, though it emerges before things, it cannot precede things—just as the existence of a thing cannot precede itself. The existence of a thing is already without limit; the sage’s approach to things, though not imposing love upon them, ensures that love never ends—this is drawn from the same principle.

**Bixu’s Annotation:** To ask about what existed before Heaven and Earth is to clarify what preceded things. The answer—"the ancient is like the present"—is to observe the self through the self. "Enlightened" refers to youthful intelligence; "confused" refers to midlife dullness. The spirit first receives this by concentrating qi and harmonizing softness, preserving the uncarved simplicity of the Dao. It also seeks for the unspiritual, desiring to refine the coarse through beauty. If the old were like the young, there would be no ancient or modern; if life were like death, there would be no beginning or end. Having a child leads to having a grandchild—this is the principle of mutual arising. It clarifies that the existence of ancient and modern disperses, and that deliberate action without accumulation cannot depart from creation. One does not bring about death through the existence of life, nor does one bring about life through the existence of death. It is clear that the living live by themselves, the dead die by themselves—death does not arise from life, nor does life arise from death. This speaks of their original lack of dependence. Each has its own unity, for there is no separate Way.

Heaven and Earth are the greatest of independent transformations. If there were something that preceded them, it would be things preceding themselves—not something that existed before Heaven and Earth. Yet things and Heaven and Earth each have their own unity. Though all are things, each thing arises on its own; the earlier thing is not the later thing, just as children and grandchildren are each distinct. Thus each thing has its own Supreme Ultimate. To say that things come after is to say that later things precede earlier ones—just as the existence of a thing is already without limit. The sage treats the people as straw dogs, yet the people’s love for the sage never ends—this is because the sage does not precede things.

**Yong Qi’s Annotation:** Spirit is the awareness within me; the unspiritual is when the numinous awareness is clouded by qi. Formerly enlightened, the empty and numinous awareness was present, so it could receive; now confused, the empty and numinous awareness is absent, so it seeks again. "No ancient or modern, no beginning or end" speaks of the principle of creation—endless arising, like people having descendants, which is known without waiting for them to exist.

"Not responding" means not speaking further. As soon as there is the word "life," there is the word "death"—this is to create death only after life exists. As soon as there is the word "death," there is the word "life"—the meaning is the same. Life and death depend on each other, yet they are one body. "Body" here means principle. That which gives rise to things is not a thing. What is not a thing emerges before Heaven and Earth and cannot be named as a thing. Once named as a thing, it cannot be said to exist before Heaven and Earth. This is to be a thing, hence it is said that no thing can emerge before things. "Just as there is a thing"—this is one phrase. Once there is a thing, then things arise without limit.

The sage’s love for others is visible in its effects. That it endures without ceasing is because what is drawn from is the existence of a thing, yet it does not recognize that what gives rise to things is not a thing.

Ran Qiu’s question came with the force of a thunderclap splitting mountains, yet the Master answered it with such ease that Ran Qiu lost his footing and withdrew. From this, the measure of the sage and the worthy may be known. Though Ran Qiu had ascended the Master’s hall, his learning remained bound to the ways of the world, so that what he had seen and heard did not extend beyond the realm of the senses. How could he have known beforehand what existed before Heaven and Earth? No wonder he asked in astonishment.

The human body models itself on Heaven and Earth. What existed before Heaven and Earth is none other than the original nature of this body. To know the original nature of this body is to know what existed before Heaven and Earth; to know what existed before Heaven and Earth is merely to extend backward from what has come after. The sage holds fast to the ancient to steer the present, and thus can surely extend the present to illuminate the ancient—how could his knowledge be limited to a mere hundred generations?

Heaven and Earth are but tiny things within the vastness of space, the greatest of all things with form. Form arises from the formless, and in the end must return to dissolution. Yet humans, with their fleeting lives and limited vision, cannot witness this—like summer insects that know nothing of ice. The spirit first receives it, knowing the spirit as spirit. Yet it also seeks for those who are not spirit, not knowing that within what is not spirit, the spirit abides.

In the past, you were bright and clear, using knowledge to seek what is called spirit—this is the spirit first receiving it. Now, you are dim and obscure, having heard the Way and forgotten your knowledge—this is the spirit abiding within what is not spirit. Why must you seek further? Let him turn his gaze inward to the source of the mind, attaining what was originally attained, neither bright nor dim. Beyond ancient and present, life and death cannot bind him. Not clinging to life as life, not using death to fix life—this is called "transformation alone," which depends on nothing, just as the previous breath is not the present breath, and the former flame is not the later flame.

Returning to the question: Is there something that existed before Heaven and Earth? It means only the Dao dwells before Heaven and Earth; no thing existed before Heaven and Earth. That which gives rise to things is not a thing. The Dao generates Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, and cannot be named as a thing. Once a thing emerges, it enters the realm of form and instruments, and can no longer be said to exist before things. It is because there are things that from one arise ten thousand, a profusion of forms constantly before our eyes. Few can stand firm and independent, untroubled by them. Thus, the endlessness of human and things arises from the endlessness of creation. The sage’s boundless love extends to all things, yet even this cannot prevent the scattering of simplicity into fragmentation. The governance of the great antiquity, uncontrived, cannot be restored. To return to the uncontrived governance of great antiquity, must one not seek what existed before one’s own Heaven?

The character *you* in the classic text is doubtful; it should likely be *by*. Yan Yuan asked Confucius: "I have heard you say, 'Do not send off, do not welcome.' May I ask about its wandering?" Confucius replied: "The people of old transformed externally but remained untransformed internally. The people of today transform internally but remain untransformed externally. Those who transform with things are one with those who do not transform. At peace with transformation and non-transformation, at peace with mingling with them, they must be without excess.

The parks of Xiwei, the gardens of the Yellow Emperor, the halls of Youyu, the chambers of Tang and Wu—these were where the noble ones of old, such as the masters of the Ru and Mo schools, clashed with their differing views. How much more so with the people of today! The sage dwells among things without harming them. Not harming things, things cannot harm him. Only one who is without harm can accompany others in sending off and welcoming.

Mountain forests! The wilds!"

Let me rejoice in this with boundless delight! Yet before the joy is complete, sorrow follows in its wake. When joy and sorrow come, I cannot resist them; when they depart, I cannot detain them. Alas! The people of this world are but travelers lodging in the realm of things. They know what they encounter but not what they do not; they know what they can do but not what they cannot. To be without knowledge and without ability—this is what no one can avoid. Yet to strive to avoid what no one can avoid—how tragic indeed!

The ultimate words transcend words; the ultimate actions transcend actions. To equalize what knowledge knows is but superficial. Guo’s commentary: Align the mind with form, and form transforms of itself. To use the mind to command form is to remain untransformed externally. To be ever without a fixed mind is to be one with the unchanging; being one with the unchanging, one can then transform with things. Whether transforming or not, all is entrusted to spontaneity—without a fixed mind, one allows things to transform of themselves, neither sending off nor welcoming, neither following nor resisting, but simply resting where they come to rest. Only by being without a fixed mind and entrusting all to transformation can one wander where the sages of old wandered. The sage is harmony. The masters of the Ru and Mo schools, whom the world finds hardest to harmonize—even one without a fixed mind can harmonize them, let alone those who approach this state!

Dwelling among things without harming them is the utmost compliance, which lies within me alone. Without a fixed mind, one attains the utmost compliance; with the utmost compliance, one can be without sending off or welcoming, and thus rise above them. Mountains and forests, wilds and marshes—these are no better than my own state, and so I delight in them without cause. Delighting without cause, one may also grieve without cause. Thus, what brings joy is not truly joy, and what brings sorrow is not truly sorrow.

The people of this world cannot sit in forgetfulness and find contentment within themselves, but instead lodge their joy and sorrow in external things, like travelers in a wayside inn. They know what they encounter but not what they do not; they know what they can do but not what they cannot. What they cannot do, they cannot force themselves to do—it is the same with ability. From this, we see that control does not lie with us; all is self-attainment. To attain through knowledge is to rely on learning, and thus remains shallow.

Lü’s commentary: The people of old transformed externally but remained untransformed internally; thus, they moved with things while preserving what could not be forgotten. The people of today transform internally, their minds conforming to things, yet remain untransformed externally, clinging to past norms without acknowledging their origins. Those who transform with things are one with those who do not. How can there be transformation or non-transformation? To have both transformation and non-transformation is not the way of non-transformation. How can one mingle with things if their actions are like a galloping horse that cannot be reined in? To be without excess is to neither send off nor welcome, but simply respond without concealment.

The parks of Xiwei, the gardens of the Yellow Emperor, the halls of Youyu, the chambers of Tang and Wu—these speak of an age of decline, where those who wandered grew fewer, and their dwellings grew narrower. The noble ones, such as the masters of the Ru and Mo schools, still clashed with their differing views. How much more so with the people of today! The sage dwells among things without harming them, allowing right and wrong to unfold in parallel, resting in the harmony of heaven. How could things harm him? Thus, though he accompanies others in sending off and welcoming, he alone wanders beyond such distinctions.

The people of this world are enslaved by external things, and so joy and sorrow find their way in. They abandon mountains and forests, the wilds and marshes, yet before my joy is complete, sorrow follows, and the two alternate without cease. Their coming cannot be resisted; their going cannot be stopped. Thus, the body is but a lodging for things, like a traveler in an inn. They know what they encounter but not what they do not; when they encounter, they coincide with things; when they do not, they part from them. They know what they can do but not what they cannot; when they can, they are enslaved by things; when they cannot, they enslave things. To be without knowledge and without ability is what no one can avoid—it is an inherent part of being. Yet to strive to avoid what no one can avoid is to lose one’s nature profoundly. How tragic!

The ultimate words transcend words; the ultimate actions transcend actions. To equalize what knowledge knows in order to avoid what no one can avoid—even if one knows this, it remains shallow.

Yi Du’s commentary: Those who transform externally but not internally allow their form to follow things while preserving inner constancy. Those who transform internally but not externally allow their minds to follow things while their form remains unchanged. Those who transform with things allow their form to change while their mind does not—thus, they are one with the unchanging. Whether things transform or not, one entrusts them to spontaneity, harmonizing with them without resistance, allowing each to fulfill its nature without excess or deficiency.

Parks are for hunting; gardens are for cultivation, narrower than parks. Halls are narrower than gardens; chambers are narrower than halls. This speaks of the constriction of human nature and destiny as the world declines, unable to return to simplicity, forcing its vast dwelling into narrowness, shaped by the times.

Are the sages truly superior or inferior? The teachings of the Ru and Mo schools, with their mutual exclusions, are the hardest to harmonize. Yet even one without a fixed mind can harmonize them—how much more so for those who approach this state! The sage dwells among things without harming them, and thus things cannot harm him. The rhinoceros does not aim its horn; the tiger does not bare its claws. This is the person of complete virtue, who alone can accompany others in sending off and welcoming—such "sending off and welcoming" is merely keeping company with others.

The nature of people is to delight in the new and weary of the old. Yet in all the world, nothing remains new without becoming old. To meet weariness with ever-changing things—how could the world not be without joy? The joy of the wealthy and powerful lies in power and profit; the joy of the reclusive lies in mountains and forests. Yet both rely on external things for their joy. Where is there anything new that does not become old, or old that does not bring weariness? When weariness comes, sorrow follows. Joy and sorrow lodge in the body like travelers in an inn.

Only those who study and attain the Dao do not dwell in wealth and power yet possess the means to govern and command; they do not hide in mountains and forests yet are sufficient to witness the transformations of the myriad things.

The presence of this power is inexhaustible, and its transformations emerge without end—what is enjoyed as new never becomes old, so how could there be weariness or sorrow? *Bixu’s Commentary*: Pursuing things is called "external transformation"; preserving the true is called "internal non-transformation." Indulging the nature is called "internal transformation"; clinging to victory is called "external non-transformation." Those who transform with things follow the same transformation as things; those who remain unchanging were never transformed to begin with. Transformation and non-transformation are simply matters of following nature—this is not merely passive compliance but also effortless simplicity.

The perfectly pure who engage with the world are like the sage who wanders, rests, and dwells in parks, gardens, palaces, and chambers—what need have they for "meeting" or "welcoming"? Even the noble scholars of Confucianism and Mohism cannot remain free of the heart’s divisions to distinguish right and wrong—how much less can those beneath them? To dwell among things without harming them is to be one with the dust and light. Things, too, cannot harm; self and other are free of the heart’s divisions. Only those who are free of what harms can engage with others in meeting and welcoming. Yet to remain free of the heart’s divisions without meeting or welcoming is easy; to meet and welcome without being swayed by things is difficult.

Mountains and forests are indifferent to people, yet many delight in them—stillness aligns with their nature. When change arrives, sorrow arises from emotion. All people in the world are led by sorrow and joy, so when they encounter [fate], misfortune abounds; when they do not, blessings remain whole. The capable are enslaved; the incapable enslave others. Thus the sage values non-knowledge and non-ability, while worldly people force knowledge and ability, harming things and themselves—this is the great affliction. If one could discard false words and false knowledge to enter that which is "not-knowing yet knowing," one would attain profound and far-reaching insight.

*Yong Qi* says: Responding to things without being burdened by them is "external transformation"; responding to things without disturbing the heart is "internal non-transformation." Engaging in conflict is "internal transformation"; being blunted by things is "external non-transformation." With my internal non-transformation externally responding to things, what passes is transformed without meeting or welcoming—then transformation is not known, and non-transformation is not known. The "one who does not transform" is the heart free of the heart—how could there be any strife? To be blunted is to be worn down. Why must one grind against things and insist on overcoming them?

Shen Nong, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Tang, Wu, and the masters of Confucianism and Mohism did not fully grasp the Way of internal non-transformation, so they arrived at mutual contention over right and wrong—*man* refers to the clashing of the five flavors. Parks, gardens, palaces, and chambers are their habitual nests. Not harming things is to transform with them; transforming with things allows one to meet and welcome others.

When people wander in mountains and forests, their hearts must delight; delight gives rise to emotion, and emotion brings sorrow—*The Record of the Orchid Pavilion* employs this meaning precisely. Delighting in things and sorrowing in things, coming and going at their behest, all without freedom—then this heart of mine is but an inn for sorrow and joy!

"Encounter" means what is visible; "non-encounter" means what is invisible. What is visible is human; what is invisible is Heaven. Ability is what one can do; inability is what Heaven does. All people in the world have what they do not know and cannot do. Only because they know the human but not Heaven do they seek to avoid what cannot be avoided—is this not lamentable? Thus, the highest words are wordless, the highest actions are actionless. Not knowing what cannot be known, yet taking what can be known as knowledge—how shallow is their vision!

The externally transformed are yielding and harmonious in their brilliance; the internally untransformed are resolute in establishing virtue. The internally transformed have hearts that shift with things; the externally untransformed are rigid and defy convention. People in the world do not transform what should be transformed but transform what should not be transformed—this is how ancient and modern, pure and decadent, are distinguished, and how the noble and the petty are divided.

The sage governs the world with earthen simplicity, transforming with things; governs the self with truth, remaining unchanging. If one can truly govern the self, then extending this to the world is but a trivial matter. When there is no distinction between internal and external, transformation and non-transformation converge in transformation. Thus, one peacefully follows along without any missteps.

Parks, gardens, palaces, and chambers are where the sage finds ease—later generations who wander there grow fewer, calling their dwellings cramped. Even the masters of Confucianism and Mohism could not avoid contention over right and wrong, clashing and harming one another—how much less can people today dwell among things without harm and meet others without being led? It is no wonder they abandon the joy of parks, gardens, palaces, and communal living to seek the solitary goodness of mountains, forests, and rustic fields.

The principle of all things is that movement at its extreme must return to stillness; the nature of people is that joy at its extreme must turn to sorrow. Those wearied by the bustle of markets long for the clarity of mountains and forests; those who delight in mountains and forests do not grasp the principle of inevitable weariness. As emotions subtly shift, they move in tandem with transformation, unaware that this body is but an inn for sorrow and joy.

*The Outer Things* says: "The great forests and mountains are good for people, yet even the spiritual cannot endure them"—this is the same meaning. "Encounter" refers to things appearing before one; "non-encounter" means things are absent and separate from people. "Visible" is as if unseen. "Ability" refers to proper action; "inability" is like the foolish who guard simplicity, abandon learning, and act without contrivance.

People invariably take the coming and going of things as sorrow and joy, not realizing that their own bodies are but temporary lodgings! How much more are the encounters and abilities they meet—must they not also be temporary lodgings of the self? Only non-knowledge is true knowledge; only non-ability is true ability—these are what people inherently possess yet cannot avoid. Now, abandoning what is inherent and instead pursuing excessive knowledge and ability, exhausting the mind and body, toiling endlessly to the point of ruin—this is what the true person laments.

People cannot be entirely without words or actions, but if the heart remains free amid words and actions, the burdens of words and actions naturally fall away—this is the highest speech and action.

If one takes the knowledge bounded by limits as the true object of knowledge, such shallowness strays far from the Dao.

The noble person—here referring to the ancients (as clarified below)—establishes this discourse on *zhi* (knowledge), for *zhi* arises from action and speech. In the "Northern Wander," one turns toward the root, bearing the intent to return to the source. The "Mysterious Water," most wondrous yet retaining the power to moisten all things, serves as a metaphor for those who hold the Dao in mind. *Wuwei* (non-action) and *wuyu* (non-speech) merge with the Dao. Thus, when asked thrice yet unable to answer, this "not-knowing" is true knowledge. Though the Yellow Emperor’s replies grow ever clearer, how do they bring one closer to the Dao?

Therefore, the sage sheds form and abandons knowledge, casts off the body and dulls the senses. Through *wuwei*, the myriad things attain completion; without speech, the world transforms. Knowing the Dao cannot be possessed, nor the self claimed as private, one sees that all things arise from the *wu* (non-being), for the cosmos is but a single *qi*. The wondrous and the foul interchange, yin and yang, beauty and ugliness arise of themselves—bursting forth, seeping in—shared by all. To transform with things yet remain unchanged is the sage’s singular attainment.

Embracing life and death as transformation, casting off the thatch and the fine robe alike, one dwells within change yet yields to it, neither resisting nor clinging to change, forgetting change even as it unfolds—how could one not rest in it? The deeper the descent, the more evident the Dao, even in the humblest clay vessel. Employing the artificial yet not relying on it, one excels in hammering and forging.

To know the era before heaven and earth from this present moment is to abide without departure. Without seeking or resisting, one harmonizes inner and outer transformation, engaging with things without harm. Thus, one who attains stillness not through circumstances is never truly still; one who finds joy not through external things is never truly joyful. Beyond the reach of transformation’s sway, untouched by burdens, a single day may span a century, a century shrink to a day—how then can we know that today’s dwelling is not the cosmos within a gourd?

Gazing calmly upon the world’s people, who take transient lodgings as their own, one sees how they often ruin their lives and harm their nature through encounters and abilities—no different from aloeswood or sandalwood cast into the furnace, their fragrance rising from the chimney while their forms turn to ash. Far better to remain untouched by encounters or abilities, preserving one’s true nature.

The Highest Sage said: "The teaching without words, the benefit of *wuwei*—few in the world attain these." Thus, the *Nanhua* concludes its outer chapters with the supreme speech that transcends speech, the supreme action that transcends action.

**Miscellaneous Chapters: Gengsang Chu, Part One**

Among the disciples of Lao Dan was one named Gengsang Chu, who had partially grasped the Master’s Dao. He took up residence in the northern mountains of Weilei, where those among his ministers who flaunted their knowledge departed, and those among his concubines who paraded their benevolence kept their distance. Only the ungainly and the self-content remained to dwell with him and serve as his attendants. After three years, Weilei flourished abundantly.

The people of Weilei said to one another: “When Master Gengsang first arrived, we were struck by his difference. Now, when we reckon our accounts, they fall short, but when we tally the year’s harvest, there is surplus. Might he not be a sage? Why do we not together offer him sacrifices as our lord, worship him as our earth-god, and honor him as our grain-spirit?”

When Gengsang Chu heard this, he turned to face south with a troubled countenance. His disciples found this strange.

Gengsang Chu said: “Disciples, why do you find me strange? When spring’s qi stirs, the hundred grasses sprout; when autumn arrives in due season, the myriad treasures ripen. Is it because spring and autumn possess some special power that this comes to pass? The Dao of Heaven has simply run its course. I have heard that the perfected person dwells like a corpse in a humble chamber, yet the people, wild and untamed, flock to him without knowing where they go. Now, the petty folk of Weilei secretly wish to honor me with ritual vessels in the manner reserved for worthies—am I to be their measuring ladle? This is why I cannot set aside the words of old Lao Dan.”

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
*Huaran* (flaunting) refers to embellished knowledge; *qieran* (parading) to ostentatious benevolence. *Yongzhong* (ungainly) denotes simplicity; *yangzhang* (self-content) denotes self-possession. At first, the people marveled at his rejection of knowledge and embrace of foolishness, but in the end, they awakened to the fact that one who moves in harmony with the four seasons is far from seeking merit. Spring and autumn’s processes of generation and fruition all follow the natural Dao, and thus he does not act. The perfected person dwells like a corpse, and the people go to him of their own accord—not through any exercise of knowledge. Thus, he does not wish to serve as a measuring ladle for others. As the *Laozi* says: “When his task is accomplished and his work done, the people all say, ‘We have done it ourselves.’” Now the people of Weilei act contrary to this, which is why he was troubled.

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:**
The Dao of old Lao Dan rejects benevolence, discards knowledge, and does not exalt worthies—not to enlighten the people by making them foolish. Thus, those among his ministers and concubines who possessed benevolence and knowledge all departed or kept their distance; only the ungainly and the self-content remained. *Huaran* and *qieran* refer to minor displays of benevolence and knowledge. *Yongzhong* means dull-witted; *yangzhang* means rigidly constrained. These are not the sort who rely on knowledge or benevolence. The people of Weilei were transformed by Chu’s Dao, no longer employing knowledge but instead devoting their energies to clothing and food—hence the great abundance. Chu’s conduct was enough to renew the people’s eyes and ears, so they were struck by his difference. His Dao achieved success without effort, which is why their reckonings fell short while the year’s harvest yielded surplus. Sacrificing as a lord, worshipping as an earth-god, and honoring as a grain-spirit are all tasks reserved for rulers and ancestral spirits—this expresses the people’s desire to exalt him. Spring and autumn are the work of Heaven, yet the myriad things remain unaware. The sage dwells like a corpse, and the people do not know where they go. Now, the petty folk of Weilei wish to honor him with ritual vessels in the manner reserved for worthies—this is what is meant by being unable to keep people from clinging to him. How could I not refuse to serve as others’ measuring ladle?

**Lin Yidu’s Commentary:**
Things receive their mandate from Heaven and are thus employed by Heaven; the people receive their mandate from their ruler and are thus employed by their ruler; disciples receive their mandate from their teacher and are thus employed by their teacher. Heaven employs things to generate them and gives them rest in death; the ruler employs the people in affairs and gives them rest with wealth; the teacher employs disciples in learning and gives them rest with the Dao. All who receive a mandate are unavoidably employed. Thus, Chu studied under Lao Dan and is called his “servant.” This is not a private favor to Chu; rather, Chu alone grasped the Master’s Dao because he was able to fulfill the reality of his inherent nature. Weilei is the Feather Mountain mentioned in the *Yu Gong*, as recorded in the *Dongling Jing*. His ministers and concubines all selected simple and unadorned people, casting aside those who flaunted knowledge or paraded benevolence. Those who were of no use as material for governance dwelled with him, while those who were not fit for office served him. After three years, there was great abundance, and the people all marveled at him. He did not seek merit, which is why their reckonings fell short; his distant effects bore fruit, which is why the year’s harvest yielded surplus. The people, transformed by his virtue, wished to establish him as their lord. Facing south to receive sacrifices as an earth-god or grain-spirit aligns with the *Laozi*’s idea that one can entrust the world to such a person. When spring arrives, things are born; when autumn arrives, things mature—this is the natural Dao at work, yet people remain unaware. To dwell like a corpse is to be still; an “enclosed chamber” is to be humble. Yet the people, wild and untamed, joyfully flock to him of their own accord—not through any exercise of knowledge. Now, the petty folk of Weilei wish to treat me with ritual vessels in the manner reserved for worthies—this is to treat me as a ladle. A ladle is a small utensil, convenient for common use, but this would violate the teachings of old Lao Dan, which is why he was troubled.

**Chen Jingyuan’s Commentary (Bi Xu):**
“Partially grasped the Master’s Dao” means his understanding of principle was most profound. Thus, he rejected intelligence, strategy, benevolence, and righteousness, associating only with the ungainly and unrefined, the self-content and self-possessed. At first, the people were startled by his abandonment of knowledge and embrace of foolishness, but later they rejoiced in the flourishing of their customs. As his Dao matured and his virtue grew, the people wished to sacrifice to him as their lord. His troubled countenance showed lingering unease with such traces. Spring and autumn follow the natural Dao, unfolding without speech—what merit is there in this for me? Thus, he dwelt in stillness and seclusion, and the people did not know where to find him. How could he consent to serve as others’ measuring ladle? To be honored with ritual vessels would be to fail to understand his teacher’s words and deliberately violate them.

**Liu Yao’s Commentary:**
The *Laozi* says: “When his task is accomplished and his work done, the people all say, ‘We have done it ourselves.’” Yet the people of Weilei wished to sacrifice to Gengsang Chu as their lord—this suggests Chu’s grasp of the Dao was still incomplete. It is also said: “If one possesses its reality but others confer a name upon him and he does not accept it, he will instead receive misfortune.” Now, hearing of their desire to face him as their lord, he was troubled—this suggests Chu’s compliance with things was still incomplete.

Moreover, it is said that Yao was not a man of men, nor did he appear as one among men—yet he endures a thousand generations after, and this is but his trace. Thus, Gengsang Chu’s Dao reaches the height of *non-doing*, yet has not attained the state of *non-non-doing*.

**Lin’s *Yanzhai Oral Exegesis*:**
"Encumbered and burdened" is like "limbs askew." "Unfettered" means free and untrammeled, distinct from others. "Yearly accounts show surplus" signifies long-term benefit. "To sacrifice to the altars of soil and grain" expresses reverence in worship. "Dancing at the tip of the brush" describes such phrasing. "Not at ease" conveys displeasure. "How could this be the result of *non-doing*?"—it means Heaven indeed effects this, for the Dao of Heaven moves of itself, a natural metaphor for the absence of intent. "Not knowing whither to go" speaks of forgetting the world. "Ladle"—a small vessel, and since I am shallow and easily perceived, others come to know me. The Buddhists say: "I cultivate *non-force*, yet ghosts and spirits see through it." "Not at ease with the words of Lao Dan" arises from fear of betraying his teacher’s instruction, hence his displeasure.

**Chu’s *Superficial Observations*:**
Gengsang—*Records of the Grand Historian* writes it as *Kangsang*, also rendered *Kangcang*, one of the various schools among the philosophers. The Tang dynasty canonized it as *The True Scripture of Dongling*. The text states: "Gengsangzi dwelled on the summit of Mount Yu." **He Yao’s Commentary:** Mount Yu lies in Xuzhou. Zhuangzi speaks of Weilei to describe his unrefined simplicity. "Distinctly" and "clearly" both denote manifest display. To practice benevolence and wisdom without concealment invites the resentment of the unbenevolent and unwise, bringing calamity and plunder. Better to dwell among the dull and blunt, where mutual *non-intent* prevails, customs are pure, and manners flourish—over time, the people delight in his transformation and wish to honor him. "Accounts fall short, yet yearly surplus remains" follows the principle of silk threads accumulating into cloth. Gengsang, fearing he was not truly known, dreaded the people’s allegiance as a burden to himself. Spring’s growth and autumn’s harvest—Heaven’s Dao moves of itself. In a sagely age, how would the people know the emperor’s power? Yet now they array me among the worthy—though I do not deem myself worthy, they still esteem me, as if setting up a ladle to invite arrows. Would I consent to this? Thus, Gengsang’s dwelling in Weilei was a concealment not yet thorough, unable to make others forget him entirely. How much better was Liezi’s residence in the Zheng gardens, where traces dissolved into undifferentiated oneness.

The disciple said: Not so. In a common ditch, great fish have no place to turn their bodies, and minnows constrain them. On a hillock of a few paces, great beasts have no place to conceal their forms, and foxes and badgers dominate. Moreover, honoring the worthy and entrusting the capable, rewarding goodness and bestowing benefit—this has been so since the time of Yao and Shun, how much more for the people of Weilei! Master, you should heed this.

Gengsangzi said: Come, little one!

The beast that fills a carriage, once armored and parted from the mountain, cannot escape the calamity of nets and snares; the fish that swallows a boat, once stranded and deprived of water, may be tormented even by ants. Thus, birds and beasts are never sated with height, and fish and turtles never sated with depth. For those who preserve their bodily form and life, to conceal themselves is but to be never sated with depth and remoteness.

Moreover, what are those two worth in praise? In their disputations, they are like those who recklessly bore through walls to plant mugwort and wormwood. Combing their hair strand by strand, measuring grains of rice to cook—how can such trifling acts suffice to save the age? When the worthy are promoted, the people contend with one another; when knowledge is employed, the people rob one another. These several things are not enough to enrich the people.

The people are most diligent in pursuit of profit: sons may murder fathers, ministers may murder rulers; in broad daylight they become thieves, and at midday they tunnel through walls. I tell you, the root of great disorder must arise from the time of Yao and Shun, and its branches will remain even a thousand generations hence. A thousand generations from now, there will surely be men who devour one another.

The beast leaves the mountain, the fish loses the water—this is to expose one’s name in the world and thereby invite harm to oneself. Yao and Shun, in their disputations, are like those who bore through walls to plant weeds, for they lack this principle. The people’s diligence in profit knows no bounds: when the worthy are promoted and knowledge is employed, contention and theft arise. The people, in their pursuit of profit, become so earnest that they spare nothing. This is because Yao and Shun left behind their traces, adorning falsehoods and spreading them to later ages, thus bringing about these ills.

Those who preserve their bodily form and life conceal themselves without ever tiring of depth and remoteness, like the dragon in the ninefold abyss, which only when submerged can manifest its numinous power. Yao and Shun, who succeeded to the throne and became rulers, achieved order and perfection through the practice of the seven virtues—yet how could they be faulted? Yet the *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi] upholds the Laoist teaching of abandoning benevolence and rejecting righteousness, always seeking to exalt the Dao and virtue while suppressing benevolence and righteousness, and thus must point to Yao and Shun as the origin. Its aim is to pluck out the root and dam the source, and it cannot but do so.

The governance of the sage causes the people to be without knowledge and without desire. Viewed through the traces of Yao and Shun, even the promotion of the worthy and the employment of knowledge inevitably lead to mutual contention and theft. When knowledge is made the means to desire, the people’s nature is led astray, and from this the source of disorder arises. The worthy and the wise, these several things, are not enough to enrich the people; they only cause superiors and inferiors to plunder one another, leading even to midday tunneling through walls without a second thought. All this is the fault of the ills left behind by the legacy of Yao and Shun.

That beasts devour one another is already detestable—how much worse when men devour one another? The shallow and narrow are the domain of eels and foxes, while the vast and deep belong to the flood-dragons and leviathans. Thus, when the Dao and virtue shine brightly, worldly customs cannot conceal them. Yet only those who are lofty, remote, deep, and recondite can remain untouched by profit and harm, while those who merely preserve their bodily form and life are not worthy of praise.

To distinguish the worthy from the foolish is to destroy simplicity; to comb hair strand by strand and measure grains of rice is to lose the undifferentiated whole. The sage does not promote the worthy or employ knowledge, thereby enriching the people and preventing usurpation and theft. Yet those who rely on knowledge seek only immediate success—how could they foresee the ruin of later days? The eel and the fox, though small, may rule the ditch and the hillock, for in every place, no matter how small, there is something to be revered. To be first in goodness and profit is to invite the pursuit of name, which in turn invites the pursuit of profit. When people possess worthiness and ability, others will inevitably honor and esteem them. Now, the humble folk of Weilei delight in honoring the able and esteeming the worthy—should you, Master, not heed them?

Yet when the beast leaves the mountain and the fish loses the water, this is to expose one’s name in the world and thereby invite harm to oneself. To take Yao and Shun as subjects of disputation is like boring through walls to plant weeds, for it lacks this principle. The people’s diligence in profit knows no bounds, and when they are without restraint, what will they not do? The disorder of Yao and Shun’s time arose from their leaving behind traces and adorning falsehoods, which spread to later ages and brought about these ills. The disciple’s claim that promoting the worthy and putting goodness first—Yao and Shun’s legacy—should be practiced in Weilei is not without reason. Yet the answer is that the perfected person conceals himself without ever tiring of depth and remoteness, like the dragon in the ninefold abyss, which only when submerged can manifest its numinous power.

Yao and Shun succeeded to the throne and became rulers, their achievements and governance complete, all carried out through the seven virtues—how could they be faulted? Yet the *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi] adheres to the Laoist teaching of abandoning benevolence and rejecting righteousness, always seeking to exalt the Dao and virtue while suppressing benevolence and righteousness, and thus must point to Yao and Shun as the origin. Its aim is to pluck out the root and dam the source, and it cannot but do so.

The reader must grasp the central intent and not be misled by peripheral words. Thus, though you cite them in debate, it is like planting mugwort to clear away weeds—combing through the strands only wearies yourself, and how can this benefit the world? Moreover, benevolence and wisdom, these several things, are what the world reveres, believing they can bring order. Yet if one does not govern them by the Dao, but merely follows their paths, one will see deceit and corruption flourish—how could it stop at mere mutual strife and theft? When customs grow shallow and thin, and all schemes are for profit, then the duties of minister and son become uneasy, the reverence for ruler and father is no longer feared, and rebellion against ethics and reason will know no bounds.

Gengsang Chu declined the well-wishers of Weilei, for he diagnosed the malady before its symptoms appeared and first secured the root. How could the world’s decay ever reach him?

Nanrong Qu straightened his robes and sat upright, saying: "One as old as I—where can I entrust my efforts to attain such words?"

Gengsangzi said: "Preserve your form, embrace your life, and let no anxious thoughts trouble you. If you do this, in three years you may attain these words."

Nanrong Qu said: "The eye and the form—I do not see them as different, yet the blind cannot see themselves. The ear and the form—I do not see them as different, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves. The heart and the form—I do not see them as different, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves. Forms and forms are alike, yet something may come between them—why do they seek each other yet fail to meet? Now you tell me: preserve your form, embrace your life, and let no anxious thoughts trouble you. I have striven to hear the Dao and let it reach my ears!"

Gengsangzi said: "My words are exhausted. The running bee cannot transform the wax moth; the Yue chicken cannot hatch the swan’s egg; only the Lu chicken can do so. Chickens and chickens—their virtue is not different, yet some can and some cannot, for their capacities are inherently great or small. My capacity is small and insufficient to transform you. Why not go south to see Laozi?"

Guo’s commentary: "Preserving the form" means guarding one’s allotted place and not grasping beyond life. Eye and eye, ear and ear, heart and heart—their forms are similar, yet their abilities differ, and one should not force imitation. Two forms open to each other yet fail to meet—something must come between them, for early exposure to separation makes transformation difficult.

Lü’s commentary: To abandon the virtue of Yao and Shun without acting—this is the ultimate accumulation. Then how can one entrust one’s efforts to attain such words? The answer is that when a person’s form is constantly preserved, the spirit can live—this is one. How could it be for the sake of things? Yet when ears and eyes are bound to sounds and sights, nose and mouth to scents and flavors, and the heart is enslaved by things, then the form is impaired and incomplete, life is sundered and unembraced, and thoughts ceaselessly trouble—thus one cannot be free of things. Only by preserving the form, embracing life, and letting no thoughts trouble you can the constant heart be attained! Where then is room for so-called sagely wisdom and benevolent righteousness?

The ears and eyes that do not distinguish sounds and sights, the heart that does not discern right and wrong—these are what the world calls deafness, blindness, and madness. For the Daoist, not seeing oneself is blindness, not hearing oneself is deafness, not grasping oneself is madness. Madness and sageliness lie only in whether one thinks or does not think. My form and that form both preserve the spirit, and the spirit has no sides—how could there be a barrier that does not open? That they seek each other yet fail to meet is only because something comes between them.

Though Qu claims not to have heard the Dao, what he knows already surpasses the common person; he has merely not yet matched Chu’s words to his heart.

Du’s commentary: Fearing that Gengsang’s Dao is hard to attain, Zhao asked how to entrust his efforts. The answer—preserve the form, embrace life—is what the *Laozi* calls "nurturing the soul and embracing the One." Nurturing the soul preserves the form; embracing the One preserves life. Concentrating the qi to achieve softness, letting no thoughts trouble you—this is how one may attain such words.

Zhao did not understand Gengsang’s intent, thinking that though the form is one, the ear, eye, and heart cannot substitute for each other. Judging by the deaf, blind, and mad, these three are distinct from the form. How could he know that the deaf, blind, and mad are precisely those whose forms are whole? My form and that form both open to external principles. Something comes between them, engaging and entangling. That they seek each other yet fail to meet is the work of the six thieves.

Qu, knowing he had not been transformed, said that Gengsang’s Dao had merely reached his ears. The running bee and Yue chicken illustrate his own small capacity, unable to transform the great—thus he sends him to see Laozi, which is what is meant by "greatness that transforms."

Bi Xu’s commentary: Zhao asked what effort could be entrusted to attain such words. The answer: abandoning worthiness preserves the form; forgetting knowledge embraces life. After a thousand days of cultivation, these words will be fulfilled.

One who holds yet does not cling—thus the mad find no self-possession. The six apertures contend, and so things interpose. What reaches the ear is but superficial perception; only spiritual awakening penetrates the heart. How can a cow’s hoof-print contain the transformation of Kun into Peng? How can a bee’s hive nurture the fledglings of Peng and Que? Such is the inherent principle. This is why Gengsang declined Zhao’s inquiry, wishing to conceal his mad words to preserve himself, and deferred to the ultimate principle in Lao Dan.

*Yanzhai’s Oral Exegesis*:
Man’s heart and senses are all open, yet the mad cannot attain self-possession, just as the deaf and blind perceive nothing. My form and others’ forms are fundamentally open and unobstructed, yet now they are interposed by desires, and the heart seeking the heart fails to find it. The Master taught me to cease restless thoughts and strive to hear the Dao, that I might perhaps attain understanding. The metaphors of the running bee and Yue chicken carry the same meaning as before. Zhao, hearing that the perfected man conceals himself in profound obscurity, asked what effort could be entrusted to fulfill such words. Gengsang instructed him to preserve his form without harm, embrace life without separation, extinguish mental activity and sever thoughts. After a thousand days of cultivation, it might be achieved. What was previously called honoring worthiness and prizing goodness is all laborious thought that harms the form and severs life’s root. Zhao had yet to awaken, still lost in the doubt at his core, thinking: the eye and form are originally one, yet the blind cannot see themselves; the ear and heart relate to form likewise. The deaf cannot hear themselves, the mad cannot attain themselves—just as Lian Shu said: “Is it only the physical frame that has deafness and blindness? Knowledge, too, has them.” Now Zhao’s affliction was not physical deafness or blindness, but precisely the deafness and blindness of knowledge, which is why Gengsang’s transformation was so costly.

When forms open, that is awakening. My form and that form both open to respond to things, fundamentally unobstructed; but when things enter and become the master, what was called “I” becomes the guest. Seeking yet failing to find is like the saying of Confucius’ disciples: “The Master’s words on nature and the Way of Heaven cannot be heard.” Seeking and finding is like when you know me, and I know the fish. Now, though heeding the Master’s teaching and striving to hear, Zhao has yet to awaken in his heart. At this point, Gengsang could do no more, so he sent him to seek swift transformation from one who embodied the Dao, that no perplexity might remain unresolved. Here one sees Gengsang’s virtue: he did not reproach others for being hard to transform, nor measure his own inadequacy. Thus he expanded the joy of his teacher’s gate, guiding disciples toward completion.

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin comments on the miscellaneous chapter *"Gengsang Chu"* (Second) from the *Nanhua Scripture*:

Nanrong Chu, carrying provisions, traveled seven days and seven nights to reach the abode of Laozi. Laozi said: “Have you come from the land of Chu?” Nanrong Chu replied: “Indeed.” Laozi said: “Why have you brought so many people with you?” Nanrong Chu, startled, looked behind him. Laozi said: “Do you not understand what I mean?” Nanrong Chu bowed his head in shame, then looked up and sighed, saying: “Now I have forgotten my answer, and so lost my question.”

Laozi said: “What do you mean?” Nanrong Chu replied: “Is it not so? If I am called foolish, I am deemed dull. If I am called wise, it only brings sorrow to my body. Without benevolence, I harm others; with benevolence, I bring sorrow upon myself. Without righteousness, I injure others; with righteousness, I bring sorrow upon myself. How can I escape this? These three dilemmas are my afflictions. I wish to ask you about them through Chu.”

Laozi said: “Earlier, I saw the question in your brows and eyes and thus understood you. Now you speak, and I believe you. Yet you stand there rigidly, as if you had lost your parents, raising a pole to seek them in the sea. You are a lost man—bewildered, adrift! You wish to return to your nature and original state, yet have no way in. How pitiable!”

*(Guo Xiang’s commentary: Laozi asked, ‘Why have you brought so many people with you?’ because he arrived burdened by these three dilemmas. Lü Huiqing’s commentary: Zhao sought the Dao, but his heart could not settle on one thing, and with these three dilemmas, it was as if he had brought a crowd with him. When one opposes the world with the Dao, the heart cannot conceal itself—this is how Laozi discerned him in the space between his brows and eyes. The Dao is what gives birth to all things; only by settling into oneness can one attain it. Now Zhao, with his scattered and inconsistent mind, seeks it in the boundless void—like a child who has lost his parents, raising a pole to search for them in the sea. How confused he is! To wish to return to one’s nature and original state yet have no way in—this is what the perfected one pities.)*

*(Yi Du’s commentary: “Provisions” refers to the vessel carrying his food. Seven days and seven nights signifies his fervent longing for the Dao, ceaseless day and night. Laozi knew he had come from Chu, burdened by these three dilemmas, so he asked why he had brought so many people with him. Overwhelmed, Nanrong Chu could not distinguish host from guest, and so he laid out the three dilemmas in succession, seeking resolution. This reveals his confusion about the roots of benevolence, wisdom, and righteousness. Laozi told him: ‘Earlier, I saw your brows and eyes and understood you; now you speak, and I believe you.’ Scholars of the world judge people by their words and appearance—this is the same principle, though those whose learning is incomplete cannot avoid delusion. Zhao has lost the true Dao, like a child who has lost his parents and tries to measure the sea with a pole—it cannot be done. ‘You are a lost man’ means he has lost the way of being human.)*

*(Bi Xu’s commentary: ‘Why have you brought so many people with you?’ refers to his shifting expressions and scattered mind. Startled, he looked behind him, his countenance betraying doubt and distress. What I meant was neither words nor appearance, so he was shocked into forgetting his answer and ashamed into losing his question. ‘Foolish’ describes a heart as dull as cinnabar. Benevolence, wisdom, and righteousness—all three bring suffering to self and others. Since the Dao is present in the very act of seeing, how much more so in words? The sea is not where parents are hidden; a pole is not a tool for probing the depths. Having lost his root and original return, he is at a loss, bewildered. To wish to return to one’s nature and original state yet have no way in—this is why he is pitiable.)*

*(The *Yanzhai Oral Teachings*: At first, he stood alone, yet Laozi said he had come with a crowd—what the Chan school calls ‘the mind within you is already in turmoil.’ ‘Foolish’ is like being benighted. The three dilemmas of benevolence, wisdom, and righteousness mean that neither having nor lacking a heart suffices—he is trapped in doubt, unresolved. ‘Rigidly’ describes a shallow, narrow demeanor. Raising a pole to seek the sea is to seek the boundless in the bounded. A ‘lost man’ is one who has lost his original heart and cannot find the natural Dao. The question ‘Why have you brought so many people with you?’ cuts deeply to the truth—this is where the exchange between Chu and Laozi becomes most earnest. If one lacks true inner vision, hearing this would surely provoke doubt. The patriarchs of the Chan school often use such methods. Overwhelmed by the first question, he forgot his answer and lost his footing, so Laozi followed with a second. When his fear and shame subsided, he laid out the three dilemmas, hoping to escape worldly entanglements. Laozi told him: ‘Are you like a child who has lost his parents, raising a pole to search for them in the sea?’ Your true nature is your closest kin—if you cannot preserve it but instead lose it, then seek it through benevolence and righteousness in the boundless affairs of the world, the more you seek, the farther you stray. Though your body remains, it is no different from being lost. ‘Bewildered’ describes having no return. To wish to return to one’s nature and original state yet have no way in is like being lost while trying to find the way back. The sage does not abandon him, so he pities and guides him. If one can transcend the three dilemmas and be free of entanglements, this is the way to return to one’s nature and original state. ‘Foolish’ is hard to reconcile; Bi Xu notes that an ancient southern manuscript reads ‘stubbornly foolish,’ likening it to a tree stump.)*

Nanrong Chu asked to enter and rest. He summoned what he loved and cast aside what he despised. After ten days of sorrow, he again sought Laozi.

Laozi said: "You have cleansed yourself—yet why this lingering heaviness? Still, within you there remains a subtle trace of aversion. That which is captured externally cannot be grasped with excessive restraint, for it will turn inward to strike; that which is guarded internally cannot be bound with entanglement, for it will turn outward to strike. If even one who protects both inner and outer cannot be sustained by the Dao and virtue, how much less one who abandons the Dao and acts recklessly?"

Nanrong Chu said: "When a villager falls ill, his neighbors inquire after him. If the sick man can describe his illness, then though he suffers, he is not truly ill. Now, when I hear of the Great Dao, it is as if I take medicine only to worsen my condition. I wish only to hear the classic of preserving life."

Laozi said: "The classic of preserving life—can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you know good and ill fortune without divination? Can you halt? Can you cease? Can you relinquish others and seek within yourself? Can you be unconstrained? Can you be unobstructed? Can you be like a child?

A child wails all day yet does not strain his throat—such is perfect harmony. He clutches all day yet his hand does not cramp—such is the sharing of his power. He gazes all day yet his eyes do not strain—his attention is not fixed on externals. He walks without knowing where he goes, dwells without knowing what he does, moves with things like a wave following the current. This is the classic of preserving life."

Guo’s commentary: To preserve form and embrace life, nothing surpasses forgetting the mind’s extensions and relinquishing the ears and eyes. If sounds and sights entangle externally, the mind’s defenses become obstructed within; if desires and aversions lash within, the ears and eyes become blocked without. Only when there is neither gain nor loss can there be true penetration. If even partial attachment is untenable, how much more so for inner and outer capture? When the ears and eyes are dazzled externally and the mind’s extensions flow unchecked within, even if one grasps tightly and binds fast, one cannot halt it.

Embracing the One without separation, one’s nature returns to its innate state. What is fitting brings fortune; excess brings misfortune—no divination is needed. *Halt* means stopping at one’s allotted portion. *Cease* means not pursuing past attachments. Relinquishing others to seek within means preserving oneself without imitating them. Without stagnation or rigidity, without the constraints of infancy, one allows the voice to emerge naturally, ungoverned by joy or anger; the hand to grasp spontaneously, not through possessiveness; the eyes to see freely, not bound to form. Trusting the feet to walk of themselves, the body to act of itself, even when riding the waves of things, one remains in accord with them.

Lü’s commentary: Knowing that likes and dislikes disturb the mind, one wishes to cleanse and return to emptiness and stillness—this is the summoning of what is loved and the casting aside of what is despised. Yet one still cannot put it into practice, hence one’s sorrow. A heavy, oppressive *qi* fills one, and a subtle leakage persists.

*Attachment* refers to things that cling stubbornly and are hard to remove. Now, if one resents the ears and eyes being ensnared by sounds and sights and seeks to control them externally, this is excessive grasping. Better to lock inwardly: if the mind does not go forth, externals will not be captured. As the *Daodejing* says: "Block the openings, shut the gates." If the mind’s defenses are captured by affairs and one seeks to halt them one by one, this is entangled grasping. Better to lock outwardly: if things do not enter, internals will not be captured. As the *Daodejing* says: "Open the gates, untie the tangles."

Thus, in perfect stillness and non-action, the myriad things cannot disturb the mind. Otherwise, even one with the Dao and virtue cannot sustain it—how much less one who merely imitates and acts? What is called "hearing the Dao" is knowing that things have never truly arisen and thus having nothing to do.

You know your own illness, but this is insufficient to withstand the medicine of the Great Dao. You wish only to hear the classic of preserving life. Preserving life takes non-action as its classic. The One is that from which the Dao itself arises, where auspiciousness abides—what need is there for divination? All these are able to halt deliberation and seek within oneself.

Unfettered and unobstructed, one becomes like a child. If his wailing arose from sorrow or anger rather than harmony, could his throat not become hoarse? To the point of grasping without knowing he grasps, seeing without knowing he sees—his actions and stillness arise from no-mind, moving with things like a wave following the current. This is the classic of preserving life.

Yi Du’s commentary: The mind’s retention of likes and dislikes is why one grieves. Washing away aversion is already cleansing. Yet the lingering heaviness and subtle leakage still manifest externally.

*Attachment* is like fettering; *striking* means closing off. The ears and eyes in relation to sounds and sights are external attachments—one must not let them become excessive grasping, drawing them inward to be closed off. The body and mind in relation to sensory contacts are internal capture—one must not let them become entangled grasping, casting them outward to be closed off.

For what enters from without, if there is a master within, it will not enter. For what emerges from within, if there is rectitude without, it will not be repelled. It is like a family with an unfilial son causing trouble outside: seize and confine him within. If he causes trouble within, seize and restrain him without. The harm of cravings to the body is like the harm of an unfilial son to the family—prevention and restraint cannot be neglected.

Zhao cites the villager’s illness as a metaphor for himself. One who is ill yet can describe his illness is not truly ill—just as *Liezi* says, "One who seeks life does not live." Zhao wishes to hear the Great Dao but has not found the method; it is like taking medicine that worsens the illness. He wishes only to hear the constant Dao of preserving life.

The answer is to embrace the One without losing it, then one need not divine to know fortune and misfortune, and can halt when seeing danger. *Cease* means to end entirely. Content with oneself and not dependent on externals, one is unconstrained and unobstructed, not losing the mind of a newborn. Concentrating *qi* to achieve softness, one’s constant virtue never departs. Thus one may enter flocks of birds and beasts without causing chaos, encounter tigers and rhinoceroses without harm. His wailing, grasping, and seeing all arise from no-mind, to the point of trusting the feet to walk of themselves, the body to act of itself, moving with the waves of things without departing from the Dao.

The *Bixu Commentary* states: One who can recognize their own illness is not yet truly ill; one who grows more confused upon hearing the Dao is difficult to awaken. Thus the great Way is hard to glimpse, and one wishes only to hear the lesser vehicle.

To "embrace the One without losing it" is to concentrate the mind while concealing its illumination. To "know fortune and misfortune" is to let sincerity and clarity halt danger. "Cease" means to no longer be enslaved, to seek within oneself and thus trust oneself. "Unconstrained and unobstructed" means to be free from all entanglements. Can one be like a newborn child? To preserve one’s uncarved simplicity.

The newborn’s pure virtue remains unspoiled, so their cries are whole, their grasp single-minded, their gaze unclinging, their spirit settled. They act without fear, flow with the current without being drowned—all this is the warp and weft of preserving life.

From *Fuqi Kouyi*: To summon what is good is to seek what is right; to dispel what is evil is to depart from what is wrong. Not forgetting likes and dislikes is the source of one’s own sorrow.

"Shu" (熟) means "shu" (孰), referring to long practice. "Yuyu" (郁郁) describes a mind not yet settled, so its agitation is visible. "Huo" (获) means to bind things with leather; "ta" (挞) is the bolt of a door—both metaphors for restraint. When responding to things externally, one seeks to restrain oneself, but the methods are too numerous to grasp. Turning inward, one seeks "inner restraint"; when the heart-mind is agitated, one seeks to restrain it, but the entanglements are too tangled to grasp. Turning outward again, one seeks "outer restraint." This shows that those who fail to grasp the essentials of the Dao find no foothold either within or without. If one cannot even uphold the virtue within their own body, how can they follow the principles of naturalness?

Such is the depth of foolish confusion: desiring to hear the great Dao yet unaware of where one’s own affliction lies, growing only more bewildered despite receiving instruction—like taking medicine that worsens the illness. Thus one no longer dares to seek the great Dao and wishes only to hear the warp and weft of preserving life.

"Embracing the One" means preserving wholeness of truth; "without losing it" means that what is received from Heaven is never lost.

Divination by milfoil and tortoise cannot foreknow fortune and misfortune; only utmost sincerity can foresee what is to come. "To halt" means to settle; "to cease" means to attain great rest. "Turn to oneself" means seeking within rather than pursuing externals. The infant cries without its voice growing hoarse, for it harbors no intent to disrupt its harmony. The newborn curls and cannot stretch, yet the young child’s prolonged grasp causes no obstruction. "Sharing in this virtue" means partaking of the same nature—all people are thus. One whose gaze does not waver looks without the mind’s interference. Unaware of where one dwells or what one does, yet moving with things in the same current—this may serve as the constant Way of preserving life.

"Pray enter and take lodging" expresses the wish to remain and receive instruction at the master’s gate. To summon what is good and dispel what is evil is to remain entangled in the passions of good and evil, yet unaware whether what one loves is truly good or what one hates is truly not good. "Self-reproach" (one version reads "cease reproach," another "reproach and cease," but neither yields clear sense; upon careful examination of the text’s meaning, it aligns with the *Book of Documents*’ "self-blame and self-correction"). To withdraw for ten days is to reflect; to reproach and correct is to move forward. If one’s learning has been lax and the vision of the Dao remains unclear, even upon encountering a sage teacher, swift transformation is difficult. Yet to wash the heart and regain clarity may be called having resolve and the ability to renew oneself.

Laozi said to you: "Who has cleansed you?" How flourishing! How boldly you advance, filling your countenance. Yet within, there lingers a subtle residue, outwardly manifest—some unremoved impurity remains. This further urges you to ascend one step higher and fulfill your resolve for self-renewal.

"Inner entanglement" refers to the solidification of the six roots; "outer restraint" refers to the defilement of the six dusts. "Restraint" implies sealing and guarding boundaries with strictness. Most interpretations read *tà* as "seize," but another plausible reading follows the complex form *miù*, breaking the sentence differently—both have their logic. Inner and outer entanglements are common afflictions of humankind. If one has a master within, and upholds it well, then emotions do not flow outward and one’s nature may be restored; the heart is not disturbed, and the Dao may be advanced.

If one remains unenlightened, it is like a villager who knows they are ill yet cannot cure themselves—how can they proceed to the great Dao? They wish only to hear the warp and weft of preserving life. To "embrace the One" is to keep the heart undivided; to "not seek attainment" is to ensure no loss. Divination cannot foreknow fortune and misfortune; when filth is removed, the heart’s brilliance shines forth. Knowing the utmost, one can halt; attaining forgetfulness, one can cease.

"Turning to oneself" means inner sufficiency, not relying on external things. "Can you be like a child?" This earnest analogy urges all to seek within and return to their original Heavenly nature. The infant’s wailing, grasping, and gaze differ from those of adults because within, it is filled with harmonious qi and harbors no intent toward externals—how could the warp and weft of preserving life surpass this?

Nanrong Qu said: "Then is this the virtue of the perfected person?"
He replied: "It is not."

This is what is called "melting like ice and thawing like frost." The perfected person shares sustenance with the earth and rejoices with Heaven, neither clashing with others over profit or harm, nor consorting in strangeness, nor scheming together, nor busying themselves with affairs. They come and go in serene stillness. This is called the *Classic of Preserving Life*.

He said: "Then is this perfection?"
He replied: "It is not. I have already told you: *Can you be like a child?* The child moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes. Its body is like the branch of a withered tree, its heart like dead ashes. In this state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune come. When misfortune and fortune are as if they never existed, how could human calamities arise?"

Guo's commentary: If one could reform oneself and apply these words, one might claim to possess the virtue of the perfected person. Yet "melting like ice and thawing like frost" makes clear that this is not so of itself. The perfected person is without intent, harmonizing with all things, never clashing over profit or harm. To think that merely hearing these words could lead to perfection—this is answered by saying it is not so. Hearing the perfect words may serve as a classic, but how can it be perfection itself? Thus, the learner does not attain perfection, and the perfected do not learn.

Misfortune and fortune arise from gain and loss; human calamities stem from love and aversion. Now, with the body like withered wood and the heart like dead ashes—utterly devoid of emotion—how could anxiety over gain and loss arise?

Lü's commentary: The human heart, when still, is like water. Yet knowledge congeals like ice, preventing emptiness. Knowing the *Classic of Preserving Life* is like ice melting and frost thawing. The perfected person’s heart remains ever like water, so their virtue does not require cultivation, and things cannot separate from them. They share sustenance and joy without clashing over profit or harm. Not consorting in strangeness, they remain unmarred by worldly peculiarities. Not scheming, they remain unaligned with worldly conventions. Free from entanglement and attachment, how could they be bound by "embracing the One" or "ensuring no loss"? Their serene coming and going is the constant of preserving life, yet this is not perfection itself. What is called perfection lies only in what is unknown—the child’s unknowing of where it goes or what it does, like withered wood and dead ashes.

Misfortune and fortune are governed by Heaven, Earth, and spirits, tied to the existence of body and heart. If one’s body is withered and heart ashen, how could they be burdened?

Du’s commentary: Nanrong Qu, hearing the *Classic of Preserving Life*, believed this to be the ultimate virtue of the perfected person. "Melting like ice and thawing like frost" is a metaphor for the obscuration of desires; hearing the teaching brings release. The perfected person’s benevolence suffices to dwell in the earth, so they accept its sustenance without discrimination; their wisdom suffices to serve Heaven, so they receive its joy without refusal. Not opposing others with the self, not yielding the self to things, profit and harm cannot sway their heart. Not pursuing strangeness to exalt the extraordinary, they preserve their constant virtue. Not scheming with cunning, they abide in simplicity. Not busying themselves with affairs, they remain steadfast in stillness. Coming and going without burden—this is the virtue of the perfected person.

Nanrong Qu asked again: "Then is this perfection?"
Laozi reiterated his earlier words: If one could be like a child, with a body like withered wood and a heart like dead ashes, how could misfortune or fortune reach them?

Bi Xu’s commentary: Taking this as the virtue of the perfected person is like seeing a bow and seeking roasted meat. Thus, medicine cures illness, and teachings resolve confusion—neither is the ultimate perfection. The perfected person cultivates virtue to harmonize yin and yang; common people exhaust their strength in farming. Sharing sustenance nurtures the body; sharing joy harmonizes nature. People and things flourish. With a sincere heart free from clashing, profit and harm are both forgotten. Abiding in constancy without strangeness, free from entanglement, they roam at ease—this is the *Classic of Preserving Life*. When principle is fully realized, words are forgotten.

Those who seek the ultimate must first return to purity and simplicity. Purity and simplicity are like an infant—the swiftest path to the Dao. To regard teachings as perfection is like chewing dregs in search of fine wine.

Yanzhai’s oral teachings: Nanrong Qu inquired about the *Classic of Preserving Life*, seeking what is secondary. Hearing Laozi’s lofty and wondrous words, he asked again about the virtue of the perfected person. Laozi replied, "It is not," fearing he would fixate on this, and thus showed him the meaning of "melting like ice and thawing like frost"—liberation and spontaneous awakening. Sharing sustenance with the earth is to be one with others; rejoicing with Heaven is to be one with Heaven.

The *Classic of Preserving Life* lies in not clashing with things to contrive strangeness, nor scheming to measure the bounds of every affair. The preceding speaks of the perfected person—here it is called the *Classic of Preserving Life*. The *Classic of Preserving Life* is precisely the affair of the perfected person. From this, one sees that the words "It is not" are not an assertion of fact.

Nanrong Qu asked again, "Then is this perfection?" Laozi replied, "Not yet." There should have been another topic of discourse, but instead he once more raised the earlier text—this was to avoid exhausting his words and allow for spontaneous awakening.

The *Liezi* records: A minister of Chen named Danlu remarked, "In my state there is one Kangkangzi who has attained the Dao of Laozi." The Lord of Lu sent his highest minister with lavish gifts to summon him. Thus, one knows that the Dao of Gengsangzi and Laozi are not different. Their promotion of benevolence and love for all things, their skill in guiding and joy in nurturing—only fearing that others might not attain it.

In this chapter, Gengsangzi speaks four times, and Nanrong Qu asks three times. When Qu went to see Laozi, Laozi spoke eight times. His earnest instruction, his unwillingness to abandon others to the realm of lost Dao—this is clearly evident.

The true nature is like water: empty, luminous, limpid, and clear—neither existent nor non-existent. When obscured and bound by the desires of things, it is like water freezing into ice. Water is utterly clear, yet when frozen, it is no longer clear; the spirit is utterly numinous, yet when congealed into form, it is no longer numinous. Hearing the Dao and awakening to principle, the ice melts and thaws—what harm is there to clarity and numinosity? It is only that people cease to seek within.

Sharing sustenance with the earth is to share in the common provision of plowing and tilling. Sharing sustenance with Heaven is to partake equally in the great harmony. If so, how could the gains and losses of people and things reach one? What use are strange conduct and scheming plans? How could one’s comings and goings fail to be fitting, or the *Classic of Life* fail to be preserved?

To study the Dao and reach this point is already to have arrived, yet he still says, "Not yet." To contradict the interpretation of perfection, he again cites the words of a child—this is the teacher’s artifice, shifting the disciple’s perspective. Clearly, it is a matter of two hands passing on the teaching, requiring the disciple’s own effort to bear it. For human nature is originally supple, but daily contact with things allows external qi to intrude, clashing and grinding—all become one’s adversaries.

If one can truly concentrate the qi and govern it with softness, returning to purity and simplicity, flawless as an infant—then what misfortune or fortune could reach one? The questioning and answering reach this point, where words are exhausted and principle is fully expounded—no further effort can be applied.

Alas! Qu’s capacity to carry the Dao was weak, and he ultimately failed to grasp even a single phrase. What a pity!

*Chapter Seventy-Two of the* Subtle Compilation of the Meaning of the *Zhenjing* of the Southern Florescence*

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin’s *Miscellaneous Chapters: "Gengsang Chu" the Third*

When the dwelling of the spirit is profoundly settled, radiance issues forth as celestial illumination. This celestial illumination is such that others perceive the person as truly human. Those who cultivate themselves thereby attain constancy; those who attain constancy are forsaken by others yet aided by Heaven. Those forsaken by others are called Heaven’s people; those aided by Heaven are called Heaven’s sons.

The learner studies what cannot be studied; the practitioner practices what cannot be practiced; the debater debates what cannot be debated. To know when to halt before what cannot be known—this is perfection. Should one deviate from this, the celestial balance will undo it.

Guo’s commentary: When virtue is settled in profound tranquility, what issues forth is celestial illumination, not human brilliance. Thus, others perceive the person as human, and things perceive things as things—each sees itself and not the other, and so remains settled in tranquility. When one cultivates humanity, one attains self-mastery and thus abides in constancy. Abiding in constancy, one returns to dwell in the self’s dwelling and naturally receives aid. Emerging, one is Heaven’s son; remaining, one is Heaven’s people—both are attained through profound tranquility, not through effort.

Thus, whatever one is capable of—though practiced, it is not effort; though rehearsed, it is not study; though spoken, it is not debate. What cannot be known cannot be forcibly known, and so one halts at this perfection. Though one may intend to act, action leads to failure, for in the end, principle cannot be violated.

Lü’s commentary: The body is humanity’s dwelling. When it is neither obstructed nor disordered, celestial illumination issues forth. Celestial illumination is unknowing and unperceiving, yet luminously penetrating. Others see the person but do not recognize their celestial nature—this is one whose appearance is human but whose essence is celestial. Those who cultivate themselves thereby attain constancy, for the Way must reach Heaven before it can endure.

To "forsake others" means to withdraw from the crowd; to "receive Heaven’s aid" means to perfect one’s celestial nature alone. Heaven’s people are not subject to human dominion; Heaven’s sons are so called because they continue Heaven’s generation. All things under Heaven can be known through knowledge, and thus what can be studied is studied, what can be practiced is practiced, and what can be debated is debated. Only the Dao cannot be known through knowledge, and thus what cannot be studied is studied—as the classic says, "to study what is not studied." What cannot be practiced is the Way that is not a Way; what cannot be debated is the debate that is wordless. Should one reverse this and engage in effort, one will merely be undone.

Du’s commentary: The dwelling is the abode of qi. When yin and yang harmonize, there is tranquility. When the dwelling is settled in tranquility, the primordial qi arises within, and natural illumination shines without. Those who perceive it perceive the human Way; those who do not perceive it perceive the celestial Way. The world does not see the Way by which the perfected one unites with Heaven, but only their traces among others. Those who emulate and cultivate this attain constancy. With constancy, one endures and becomes a person of perfected nature. Having fully realized the human Way, though others may forsake them, Heaven aids them. Those forsaken by others are not the people of others but Heaven’s people; those aided by Heaven are not the sons of others but Heaven’s sons.

There are those who dwell in humble alleys, unknown to others, who follow Heaven in their comings and goings—these are Heaven’s people. There are those who occupy the halls of state, aided by Heaven, who revere and serve Heaven—these are Heaven’s sons. Today’s learners forcibly study what cannot be studied and thus harm their nature; they forcibly practice what cannot be practiced and thus harm their virtue; they forcibly debate what cannot be debated and thus violate principle. All this exceeds the bounds of one’s inherent nature, and so one cannot attain perfection but instead undermines one’s natural endowment.

Bi Xu’s commentary: When the numinous dwelling is greatly at peace, wisdom’s light shines within, and the celestial court gleams without. If I call an ox an ox, others call it an ox; if I call a horse a horse, others call it a horse—each thing names itself, and celestial illumination is not deluded. Those who cultivate great peace harmonize their light without altering their nature, never differing from the ordinary. In accord with things, they are forsaken by others yet honored by Heaven’s sons and aided by Heaven—these are those of constant virtue.

Worldly study studies what cannot be studied; true study studies what can be studied—this is the principle that "the world’s difficult tasks must begin with the easy." Worldly practice practices what cannot be practiced; true practice practices what can be practiced—this is the saying that "the sage’s words are easy, yet none in the world can practice them." Worldly debate debates what cannot be debated; true debate debates what can be debated—this is the saying that "the good do not debate; those who debate are not good." To know when to halt before what cannot be known and thereby attain perfection is like a boatman who stops at the shallows—should he seek to speed and sink, he would be imperiled. How could this not be failure? To return to one’s nature—what else could it be?

*Yanzhai’s Oral Exegesis*: Here, Master Zhuang broadly expounds the ultimate principle.

The cosmos is like the breast—when vast and settled, the light of Heaven emerges, which is sincerity manifesting as clarity. Once the light of Heaven shines forth, others see only the person, yet one is already aligned with Heaven. Cultivating the truth to this point is called "awakening," which is the enduring sincerity of utmost integrity. Thus, Heaven aids such a one, and people turn toward them.

The "Heavenly People" are no ordinary folk. The "Son of Heaven" is one whom Heaven cherishes as a child. In learning, conduct, and discourse—these three—people always flee from what they cannot learn, cannot practice, or cannot debate, for these are the natural Way. When one’s knowledge reaches its limit in what cannot be known and halts there, this is the pinnacle of attainment. To turn from this path is to invite the Creator’s ruin.

The body is the dwelling of spirit; when spirit is at peace, the dwelling is vast and settled—like a lord whose tranquility brings harmony to the household, or a ruler whose non-action brings serenity to the state. When vast and settled, movement, stillness, sitting, and all external states are naturally stable, not through rigid control or forced restraint, as if tethering a horse to halt it.

The light of Heaven is the inner radiance of one’s own numinous clarity, outwardly manifesting like a measureless weight of gold—others see one as merely human, yet in truth, one walks with Heaven. To cultivate this is to embody the constant virtue; with constant virtue, one’s merit aligns with Heaven’s movement. Outwardly appearing simple, the world overlooks and abandons them, yet Heaven loves and aids them, for their heart accords with Heavenly virtue.

The "Heavenly People" transcend human virtue, shining without dazzling. The "Son of Heaven" embodies Heaven’s principle and establishes the ultimate standard, extending virtue to others—this is what is meant by "dwelling above as the Son of Heaven, the virtue of emperors and kings; dwelling below as the Unmanifest Sage, the Way of the plain and unadorned kings."

All these are what the noble person should learn and practice, yet most people busy themselves with learning what others can do, losing their own innate abilities. Only those who attain the Way learn what others cannot learn—learning the unlearnable; practice what others cannot practice—non-action that pervades all; debate what others cannot debate—the debate of silence.

Truly attaining this is to know what others cannot know, reaching the utmost of knowledge. To abandon this and seek progress on the Way is to disrupt the natural balance, like clay on a potter’s wheel—how can one hope to perfect one’s virtue, let alone emit the light of Heaven and receive Heaven’s aid?

This is now difficult to explain; it seems it should be "accord with Heaven’s balance," as the ancient text uses *jūn* (balance), interchangeable with *gōu* (potter’s wheel).

Preparing things to sustain form, concealing the unforeseen to nurture the heart, reverence within extending outward—if, following this, myriad evils arise, they are from Heaven, not from people, and cannot disturb one’s completion. They cannot enter the numinous terrace, for the numinous terrace has its support, yet one does not know what supports it, nor can it be grasped.

If one does not see the sincerity within that gives rise to action, every action will be misplaced. If karma enters and does not depart, each change will be a loss. Doing evil in the open, people can punish it; doing evil in the hidden, ghosts can punish it. Only one who is clear about people and clear about ghosts can walk alone.

Those who act within the contract move beyond names; those who act outside the contract pursue extravagant expenditures. Moving beyond names, even the mediocre possess radiance; pursuing extravagance, one is but a merchant—others see them as towering, yet they are merely hulking.

One who exhausts things is entered by things; one who contends with things cannot even contain themselves—how can they contain others? One who cannot contain others has no kinship; one with no kinship is forsaken by all.

No weapon is sharper than the will—even the *móuzōu* blade is inferior. No enemy is greater than yin and yang, from which there is no escape between Heaven and Earth. It is not yin and yang that harm one, but the heart that employs them.

Guo’s commentary: Following what is self-sufficient, conforming to the completion of form. The heart generates itself—it does not emerge from calculation. Principle naturally extends outward—it is not reverence within neglecting externals. Heavenly principle has its own cycles of exhaustion and passage; calamity arises from human action. Accepting it as fate, its completion remains undisturbed. The numinous terrace is clear and unobstructed—anxieties and rest cannot enter.

"Having support" means not being moved by externals, yet in truth, it is not support. If one knows what supports it and tries to grasp it, one loses it. If action does not arise from one’s own sincerity, how can it be fitting? If affairs lie outside one’s proper role, this is the cause of loss.

If one feels no shame in hidden or visible actions, one can walk alone without fear. Moving within one’s proper role, conduct is not bound by names. Pursuing extravagance to benefit others is to diminish oneself for things.

One who acts beyond names inherently possesses this radiance and employs it. One who pursues extravagance, though it is not originally theirs, borrows it to trade. Others see them as stable, yet they deem themselves secure.

"Exhausting" means beginning and ending. "Contending" refers to acting outside the contract and being hulking. If one cannot even contain oneself, then even the self is not one’s own—how can there be kinship? Thus, one is forsaken by all.

The aspirations one clings to congeal fire and freeze ice—thus the weapon of the will is sharper than swords and halberds. When the heart commands qi, yin and yang clash and knot within the five viscera—can one escape this? Wherever one is, yin and yang abide; thus there is no escape.

Master Lü’s commentary: All things and I form one body—this means that when the primordial departs, things do not follow, for one is complete in oneself. "Guiding the form" means that wherever one goes, things follow; when things come, the heart responds—not born of calculation. From this reverence arises, and through it one reaches others. There is no reliance on externals; reverence straightens the inner self. If, despite this, myriad evils arrive, it is Heaven’s doing. Since they arise not from action but from ruin, they cannot disturb completion. When the numinous terrace remains unmoved, there is something that holds and is held. None know its direction, for it is held by non-holding. Knowing this, one attains the sincerity that issues forth and invariably strikes the mark. Otherwise, reckless action brings misfortune—how can it be fitting?

When karma enters from without yet finds no master within, it will not depart. "Not departing" means its swift removal; each time one errs further, vulgar learning seeks to restore the original state, yet one remains a deluded person. The contract exists to master and possess things. Acting upon what resides within oneself is within the contract—sincerity in solitary action. Acting upon what does not reside within oneself is outside the contract, for one’s sincerity is not unified in hidden and visible realms.

Those who act beyond names follow the Dao, thus they are trustworthy without expectation. Those who act outside the contract must first prove trustworthy, first expend effort to give—only the mediocre possess radiance, which returns to its brightness when unused. Merchants merely trade; others see their insufficiency yet they strut in self-importance. If one perceives that things have never truly existed, one exhausts things yet remains without self. Without self, things enter yet are not cherished—this is called "knowing the constant and embracing all." Otherwise, one merely accompanies things.

If the self cannot contain itself, "your fragment of body will be rejected by qi, your single joint will be unsupported by earth"—how then can you contain others? One who cannot contain others has no kinship; without kinship, all people are estranged. The weapon of the will wounds the heart; weapons of war wound only the body. Bandits can be fled and evaded, but the bandits of yin and yang cannot be escaped within heaven and earth. Only the perfected person weakens the will and does not insist—thus they have no weapon. Concealed in non-yin, non-yang, and without heart, the myriad things cannot steal from them.

*Dú* commentary: All things are complete within me; the principles of nature and destiny are fully possessed. Retreating to concealment without calculation, when things come, one merely responds. Reverence and righteousness are established, and virtue is not solitary. If, despite this, myriad evils arrive, it is the preservation of Heaven’s mandate, not human action. The learning of the perfected person has reached the mandate; even affairs that are detestable cannot disturb their settled heart. The numinous terrace holds something, desiring its preservation. If one does not know the way of holding it yet clings to it with intent, it cannot be held.

Virtue can perfect the self; extending it to things is not misplaced. If one is insincere and acts recklessly, karma enters and does not depart—thus what was once gained becomes loss. To do evil openly is to deceive others; to do evil in secret is to deceive spirits. With shame in the heart, how dare one walk alone? Remaining within the contract is not overstepping one’s role. Relying on externals is how one acts beyond names. Going beyond the contract is to delight in others. Chasing things without end is how one aspires to extravagance. Acting beyond names, one is replete and radiance shines forth. Those who pursue extravagance seek through reputation, accept from others, and fear not being accepted—seeing their fondness for strutting, their foundation is precarious. Yet they remain arrogantly self-satisfied, unaware of change. Knowing change, things enter. Those who merely accompany things do not depend on them. If the self does not even dare contain itself, how can it contain others?

The perfected person has no kinship; one without kinship fulfills the human Dao—how could the Heavenly Dao not be fulfilled? People know the cruelty of weapons, yet do not know the harm of the heart is far greater. Weapon harm can be avoided; heart harm goes everywhere unchecked. Excessive joy congeals ice; excessive anger scorches fire—all are commanded by the heart. Only one without heart cannot be invaded by yin and yang or harmed by the five phases.

Master Bìxū’s commentary: The nature of the worthy and foolish cannot be altered—this is "completeness in oneself." The propriety of advance and retreat has gradations—this is "guiding the form." The intent of closing the sack without care gives rise to the heart that responds to things. Within, one is reverent and solemn; without, one is not insulted. When misfortune arrives without cause, it is Heaven’s mandate; when blame is incurred through attachment, it is human affairs. Abiding in stillness without worry, the numinous terrace is unobstructed, and one’s nature remains unharmed. Having something to hold, true nature is preserved; not knowing what holds it, there is no master. What cannot be held is led by one’s settled heart.

Without sincerity, all actions are reckless; the Dao and karma are difficult to enter, leading to further loss. Acting within the contract is to proceed without deviation, thus one is self-illuminating. Acting outside the contract, aspiring to extravagance, one becomes a peddler. Others see their precarious strutting yet they deem themselves secure. Those who exhaust things are within the contract, growing ever more with others. Those outside the contract merely preserve themselves. Without kinship, one is isolated and unattached. The aspiration to extravagance is more poisonous than blades; the reckless heart is a greater bandit than yin and yang. Thus the malevolent qi of excess cannot be escaped.

*Yuànzhāi’s Oral Teachings*: All things are complete within me. One follows the natural arising of life and retreats to concealment in the realm of non-thought.

The heart’s response to things arises in accordance with the times—what the Buddhists call "wherever one goes, the mind arises there." Reverence abides within, naturally extending outward. When matters arise that do not conform to one’s intent, it is truly Heaven’s doing—how could they disturb the perfectly formed virtue within my breast?

*To hold* means to have something as one’s master, yet without knowing what that master is. *What cannot be held* refers to being fixated on holding fast, which remains untransformed. The phrase with three instances of *hold* is exceedingly subtle. When one lacks sincerity and acts recklessly, missing the mark upon acting, one becomes entangled in the consequences. Though one may recognize the error, one cannot let go—this is the shame of transgression and the fault of wrongdoing. With every attempt at correction, further deviations appear. The karma of untrained conduct—what people now call the karma of established actions—brings human condemnation and ghostly retribution, from which there is no escape.

Knowing the awe-inspiring nature of the unseen and the manifest, one should be vigilant in solitude, thus able to walk alone. *Within the contract* means not overstepping one’s allotted portion, so others cannot name it. *Outside the contract* means seeking what lies in others. The aspirations one sets are merely resources for expenditure, aiming at self-benefit. Only the mediocre possess brilliance—fullness that radiates enduring light. To abandon oneself and seek externally, with the mind set on profit, is the mentality of merchants. Others see their precarious strutting, deeming them towering and venerable, unaware that they are submerged in desire, pursuing it to the point of exhaustion.

Moreover, those who chase things, grasping at whatever they can, rushing toward disaster without remorse—such people cannot even accommodate themselves among others, let alone kin. To be estranged is to sever the bonds of humaneness. Any attachment of the heart can wound oneself, more poisonous than blades. The harm of yin and yang is like that of bandits. When the heart is at peace, it cannot cause harm.

If one knows that the myriad transformations arise within the body, the greatest of all things, one can accord with the principles of life. *To conceal* means to delve deeply. *To generate the mind* means to respond to things. By deeply entering the realm of non-thought, things come and one responds—responding without a mind, reverence abiding within and naturally extending outward. This is self-cultivation and the transformation of things. Even if calamities of recklessness arise, one accepts them without allowing them to disturb one’s perfected nature.

The *spirit terrace* is an analogy for the heart’s emptiness, spaciousness, and luminosity. When external things arrive, they are received without lingering; if they accumulate within, they become extreme and the spirit loses its efficacy. *To hold* means to govern it. Knowing it cannot be held, one holds it by not holding. Without sincerity, there is no inner reverence; acting inappropriately means failing to extend outward—both are errors.

*Karma* refers to worldly, intentional actions. Not inclining toward good necessarily inclines toward evil. Those who do good are few, while those who do evil are many—thus none escape the condemnation of humans and ghosts, for cause and effect intertwine endlessly. Viewed through the Dao, both good and evil karma are illusory—how much more so evil? Yet those who do evil are always uneasy, their dreams restless, and at the threshold of life and death, how could they not be terrified? It is not that ghosts and spirits seek vengeance; the heart itself does this.

To do good with the mind set on seeking blessings is to allow deluded thoughts to sprout, losing one’s true nature, and becoming susceptible to external temptations. Thus, if either good or evil karma lingers in the heart without separation, the more one acts, the more one loses—how then can one know the way to uphold the spirit terrace?

Only those who comprehend the conditions of the hidden and the manifest can walk alone between Heaven and Earth, moving without shame. Those who focus inwardly value substance, thus acting without fame and establishing virtue as if in secret. Those who focus outwardly value splendor, thus aspiring to utility and parading their abilities. Only by returning brilliance to clarity can one endure.

Merchants seek to sell, unlike those who deeply conceal as if empty. This describes inconstant people who prioritize externals over internals. Others see their restless striving and deem them grand and imposing. *Those who exhaust things* means fully realizing the nature of things. *To enter* means to return. If one clashes with things, self and other stand in opposition—how can one who cannot accommodate oneself accommodate others? For one of great virtue, what cannot be accommodated? If I lack virtue, others will reject me equally. Inability to accommodate others leads to isolation, with everyone else beyond oneself. Divergent aspirations breed conflict, no less than the banditry of yin and yang. Tracing its source, the heart is the thief.

How great is the heart! It is the source of good and evil, the pivot of fortune and misfortune. If one fails to grasp the essentials of holding it, desires will shake it, leading to insincerity and misaction. Condemnation by humans and retribution by ghosts become inescapable. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, a single fragment of the body will have no place to reside! Thus the noble person is cautious in what arises.

*Hidden and manifest*—the old pronunciation is *xián* (闲), but considering the meaning of "manifest" above, this should be *hé* (合), a missing stroke in transmission.

*End of Scroll Seventy-Two of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei*.*
*#1 According to the* Que Wu*, Zhang Junfang’s edition includes "others see their person, things see their things" after "others see their precarious strutting." The Guo commentary also does so.*

*Scroll Seventy-Three of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei*.*

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu’s *Miscellaneous Chapters: "Gengsang Chu" (Chapter Four)*

The Dao is all-pervading—its division is #1, its completion is its destruction. What is detestable about division? Its division is for the sake of completeness. What is detestable about completeness? Its having a means to completeness.

Thus, to emerge and not return is to reveal one’s ghost; to emerge and obtain is called "obtaining death." To be extinguished yet possess substance—this is one with the ghost. By using the formed to model the formless, one attains stability.

Emerging without root, entering without aperture. Possessing substance yet without location, having length yet without root or tip, having an emergence yet without aperture—this is possessing substance.

Possessing substance yet without location is *yu* (space). Having length yet without root or tip is *zhou* (time). There is life, there is death, there is emergence, there is entry. Emerging and entering without visible form—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is Non-Being. The myriad things emerge from Non-Being. Being cannot use Being to create Being; it must emerge from Non-Being, and Non-Being is the absence of Non-Being. The sage conceals himself therein.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
Completion and destruction have no fixed division, yet the Dao pervades all. Not abiding by one’s division and seeking completeness—this is why division is detestable. One’s original division is incomplete yet seeks completeness—this is why completeness is detestable. Not returning to guard within one’s division, one’s death will not be long in coming. Not emerging yet fundamentally obtaining—this is obtaining life. Extinguishing one’s nature, though possessing life, how is it different from a ghost? If the formed can be vast and without attachment, then life is preserved and form is stabilized.

Emerging spontaneously, it has no root; dying spontaneously, it has no basis. To say that what emerges has substance is merely that its emergence has no root or aperture. Space has the four directions and above and below, yet the four directions and above and below have no bounds. Time has the length of past and present, yet the length of past and present has no limit.

Life and death, emergence and entry—all occur suddenly of themselves, without cause, and thus their form is unseen. The Gate of Heaven is the collective name for the myriad things, akin to the "Gate of the Myriad Mysteries." Things have gathering and scattering, concealment and revelation, hence the names of emergence and entry, yet ultimately there is no emergence or entry—where then is the gate? If Non-Being is the gate, then it is the Gate of Non-Being.

Before Being existed, what was it that gave rise to it? It must have arisen from Being—how could Being itself create Being? This clarifies that Being cannot create Being but arises of itself. It is not that Non-Being can create Being—if Non-Being could create Being, what would Non-Being be? If there is one instance of Being, then Non-Being is already lost. If Non-Being is truly Non-Being, then Being spontaneously arises—this is the illumination! Thus, the sage allows things to live of themselves and does not force life.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
All things possess the Dao, thus without completion or destruction, their division is precisely what enables pervasiveness, and their completion is precisely what enables destruction. What is detestable about division? It is because completeness arises from division. What is detestable about completeness? It is because division arises from completeness. If division exists for the sake of completeness, then completeness stands in opposition to division, and division differs from pervasiveness. If there is a means to completeness, it is not spontaneous completeness, and completion differs from destruction. This is how the Dao becomes dispersed.

Only by dividing without awareness of completeness, and by being complete without awareness of the means to completeness, can one go anywhere without obstruction. The Dao transcends life and death. Emerging and possessing life must return to what was never born—then life is preserved. Emerging and not returning, though alive, reveals one’s ghost. Emerging and obtaining life is due to deliberate action—obtaining death is fitting. Extinguished yet possessing substance, one cannot return to the original thing. Emerging and not returning—how is this different from emerging and obtaining? Thus, their ghostly nature is one and the same.

Only by using the formed to model the formless can one attain stability. Stability means not being disturbed by life and death. Things that emerge must have a root; emerging from the Dao, they have never had a root. Things that enter must have an aperture; entering the Dao, they have never had an aperture. Things that possess substance must have a location, yet what emerges without a root possesses substance without location. Things that have length must have a root or tip, yet what enters without an aperture has length without root or tip.

Thus, the text should read: "What emerges without a root has length; what enters without an aperture has substance"—then the meaning is complete. Space has the four directions and above and below, thus possessing substance. If I take what is above me as "above," then what is above my "above" takes my "above" as "below," and this applies to what is below and the four directions as well—how can there be a fixed location? Time encompasses past and present, thus possessing length. If the present takes the past as past, and the future takes the present as past, how can there be a root or tip?

Realizing this, one is not constrained by space and time; the six directions and four limits are nowhere absent. Though there is life and death, emergence and entry, their form is unseen—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is Non-Being. Being cannot create Being; it must emerge from Non-Being. The things of the world are born from Being, and Being is born from Non-Being—this is so. What is called Non-Being is not Non-Being, yet all Non-Being is negated—this is the true Non-Being. The sage conceals himself therein, roaming where things cannot pursue yet all are preserved.

**Yi Du’s Commentary:**
The Dao emerges from Heaven; division originates from nature. Division entails completion and destruction, but the Dao pervades them. People do not abide by their division yet seek completeness—this is why division is detestable. If division is incomplete yet seeks completeness, this is why completeness is detestable. If one is greatly complete yet makes no demands, what is there to detest?

Things emerge from the Dao and do not return—they reveal their ghost. If they can return, they do not depart from the spirit. Emerging and obtaining is called death; the spirit has no death. Extinguished yet possessing substance, one is the same as a ghost.

Only that which has form yet bears no burden remains constant—when it mirrors the formless, it attains stability.

Things burst forth of themselves, revealing no origin; they vanish of themselves, disclosing no aperture. Emergence is called life; vanishing is called death. To possess substance is nature. To abide nowhere is to cling to no realm. That which endures is the Dao. The root is swift, the end and beginning one. Where there is emergence, there is substantive nature; substantive nature is fundamentally empty—thus it is called the aperture of Non-Being.

All that possesses form and vessel cannot escape the midst of the cosmos, yet their death and life, emergence and vanishing remain unseen—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is where spirit comes and goes, now closing, now opening; the myriad things emerge and vanish here, yet in essence, nothing exists. What exists must arise from Non-Being, but Non-Being itself is not a nothingness—this is the ultimate! The sage conceals himself therein, so nothing can harm him.

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:**
The Great Dao is all-pervading, embracing both Being and Non-Being, yet each thing has its allotted portion—one cannot prescribe a single remedy for all. As fish thrive in water while ants drown in it, the inherent portion is already fixed, the natural endowment of things. Thus, though completeness is detestable, one cannot escape the karma of prior causes—hence it is said, "it possesses the means to be complete." If the true is dissipated and does not return, yin qi comes to dwell there—thus its ghost appears. To open the mouth and manage affairs is called "emerging and obtaining." If what is lost is equated with loss, this is called "obtaining death." Once the celestial light is extinguished, though substantive nature remains, it becomes one with the dark and obscure.

Those who cultivate the Dao take emptiness as their body and Non-Being as their mind—how could this not be stability? Creation has no root; the Great Void has no aperture. Though rootless and apertureless, principle possesses substance—yet where it resides remains unknown. The wondrous root knows no premature end; this is called "enduring," yet no beginning or end is visible. Observing its solitary transformation, one sees that though apertureless, it possesses substance. The four directions and above and below are boundless, and its substance is likewise boundless; past and future are infinite, and its substance is likewise infinite. Though names exist for life, death, emergence, and vanishing, no paths lead to them—thus it is called the Gate of Heaven. The Creator is no-thing; all forms are self-created, and the Gate of Heaven, too, does not exist.

For Being cannot generate things—what is generated lies in Non-Being. Movement cannot transform forms—what is transformed lies in stillness. Both Being and Non-Being inevitably involve entanglement, so one lodges in the principle of utmost Non-Being and wondrous Being, merging them into a single Non-Being. The sage conceals himself therein, in unity with creation.

**Yongzhai’s Note:**
The world divides completion and destruction into two, but from the perspective of the Dao, they are one—this is to penetrate their division. When the heart divides self and other, it inevitably seeks completeness in self-interest. All that exists returns to Non-Being, yet those who seek completeness in self-interest merely pursue Being—thus those who embody the Dao detest this. Responding to things and returning is to obtain and become spirit; pursuing things without returning is to sink into the realm of ghosts.

To be without affirmation or negation toward things is to keep this heart ever alive. Clinging to affirmation and negation without transformation is to render this heart dead. "Emerging and obtaining affirmation" means being enslaved by externals and acquiring self-righteous views—this is a heart near death, from which yang cannot be revived. Being and Non-Being are the substantive principle between Heaven and Earth; if one extinguishes them with a private heart and clings to Being as real, that person is no different from a ghost. Only by using form to image the formless can one see principle as stable.

As the Buddhists say: "Simply empty all that exists; do not substantiate what does not." Things must have a beginning, yet it cannot be known; things must have an end, yet the place of their vanishing is unseen. Though substantive principle exists, it cannot be sought in any direction; past and present are thus, without visible beginning or end. The cosmos is used to illustrate the Dao’s vastness and constancy. The life, death, emergence, and vanishing of things all have their source, yet no visible form—this is the wonder of creation. The Gate of Heaven is creation’s spontaneity; because things emerge and vanish here, it is called a gate. All emerges from Non-Being, yet this Non-Being is itself a singular Non-Being. The sage’s heart conceals itself in Non-Being—this is also the meaning of "concealing in secrecy."

The Dao originates from the One; the true body is undifferentiated, yet it pervades and generates the myriad things—its body is thus divided. Yet the completion of the myriad things is the Dao’s destruction. Thus, one detests division because, though the qi of the Dao is fully present in the myriad things’ distinctions, the sage fears that as things proliferate, the Dao becomes ever more fragmented, the uncarved block scattered and difficult to restore. One detests completeness because people cannot forget things to unite with the Dao; the more they amass the means of life, the more they neglect the Way of preserving life. There are those whose forms are not nourished despite excess.

The Dao’s pervasiveness through the myriad things is like water’s pervasiveness through the hundred rivers. The Dao has no intention to pervade things, yet things cannot but receive the Dao; water has no intention to pervade rivers, yet rivers cannot but accept water. Only when the Dao pervades things does the power of generation and completion become manifest; only when rivers accept water does the work of transport and bearing come to fruition. Thus, in its division, how could division be detestable? In its completeness, how could completeness be detestable? This aligns with the *Qi Wu Lun*: "Its division is its completion; its completion is its destruction. The myriad things are neither completed nor destroyed, returning to unity in the Dao."

"Emerging without returning" means forgetting the Dao and pursuing things, seeing one’s movement toward the realm of death—"this" refers to this Dao. To be "born and obtain this Dao" is to enter death through the Dao as well. "Obtaining death" means reaching one’s destined death, akin to "nurturing life to nurture death." The world destroys its true nature, mistaking things for reality; though the form remains, it is no different from death—this is what is called a "walking corpse." Only by using form to image the formless can body and mind both be emptied—how could things then move them?

Emergence is not without origin, yet none know where it sprouts;
Return is not without aperture, yet none know where it returns.
Truly able to empty both body and mind, one becomes vacant yet numinous, still yet luminous—
things arise and are surely reflected, not a hair’s breadth deceived.
How much more so for one’s own sprouting and returning?

"Substance" refers to true nature.
"Eternity" refers to the source from which nature arises.
True nature manifests everywhere without fixed location:
in the eye, it is called seeing; in the ear, hearing.
The source from which nature arises governs form and division, its beginning and end unknown—
it endures from high antiquity yet does not age.

That which emerges without origin has eternity—
it speaks of birth yet none can fathom its root, merely flowing with transformation.
That which enters without aperture has substance—
it speaks of death yet none can perceive its gate, merely an undimmed singular truth.

Master Lü’s supplementary lines are most apt:
If one takes spacelessness as the cosmos, then wherever one dwells is at peace;
If one takes rootlessness as the cosmos, then wherever one goes is attained.
How could the cosmos fail to contain the myriad beings?
How could the myriad beings vie with the cosmos?

All things’ birth, death, emergence, and return must have that which governs and sustains them,
yet its form is unseen—this is called the Gate of Heaven.
Forced to name it a "gate" by the passage of things, in truth it has no existence.
To cling to its non-existence is still not free from existence;
only by transcending both existence and non-existence does one reach the subtlety of true emptiness,
wherein the ten thousand things and principles reside.
The sage conceals himself in non-existence, thus can possess all things without exception.

*Biao* means "tip" or "end."

The ancients’ knowledge reached its utmost!
Where did it reach? Some held that there had never yet

The theory of "shifting right and wrong" begins with the advent of life, thus taking life as its root. Life emerges from consciousness, thus taking consciousness as its teacher. Through mutual reinforcement, right and wrong proliferate. Once right and wrong shift, outcomes acquire names and realities, and one thereby takes oneself as correct. In its extreme, this leads to treating one’s own rightness as personal integrity and clinging to it—even to the point of dying for it—without realizing that what one calls the self never yet possessed any fixed substance. Success and failure, poverty and prosperity, are not of the self, yet people falsely divide themselves into categories of wise and foolish, honored and disgraced. This is the harm of today’s "shifting right and wrong"—like the warbler and the turtledove sharing the same nest, how could they know of the greatness of the celestial pond?

*Dubi Zhu* annotates: "Never yet possessed any fixed substance" refers to the time before the Great Beginning; "possessing substance" refers to the time after the Great Beginning. The Great Beginning is the origin of qi. Qi contains yin and yang, hence beings have birth and death. Beings arise from existence, and existence arises from the primordial. To know that life is the loss of the primordial is to know that death is the return to the root. Yet birth and death are already divided. After the advent of beings, life begins from primordial existence; once there is life, death soon follows. Primordial existence is like the head, life like the body, death like the corpse—though these three have sequence, they belong to one body, just as the Zhao, Jing, and other four clans originally shared one surname, yet scattered until they became many. *Zang* means "black darkness." To treat *zang* as an excrescence of life and disperse it is called "shifting right and wrong." What is spoken of here is unknowable. To claim knowledge and speak of it is to shift right and wrong further.

The *la* sacrifice is the great offering. *Pìgāi* refers to the ox’s viscera. When conducting the full ritual, one may not distribute the offerings; once completed, distribution is permitted. If distribution is forbidden, then to distribute is deemed wrong; if distribution is permitted, then to distribute is deemed right—thus the mutability of rightness. This is like deeming feasting and libations proper within the ancestral temple, yet deeming repose and stillness proper when retiring to the privy. Humans are bound to life, thus clinging to their own rightness. If one could relinquish life, where would rightness reside? With life comes knowledge, and through it one rides upon rightness. Yet both right and wrong are delusions clung to as if they were name and reality, taking the self as substance—substance being fixed and immutable. Thus the self becomes the arbiter of right and wrong, demanding others honor one’s principles, even to the point of repaying with death. Such is to judge wisdom and folly by acceptance or rejection, honor and disgrace by success or failure. This is the world’s shifting of rightness—how does it differ from the oriole and turtledove both deeming thistles and mugworts right?

The *Bixu* commentary states: Before the advent of beings, all was profound and ineffable; only those who act with silent devotion may inwardly realize it. Next comes the advent of beings, referring to the embryo. The perfected person treats life as loss and death as return, thus acknowledging life and death. Though life and death differ, both emerge from the singular source of primordial *qi*, just as the Zhao, Jing, and Qu clans, though bearing different surnames, all trace to the single lineage of the Duke of Chu. *Zhuódài* refers to splendid robes and caps; *Jiǎshì* to eminent clans and lofty ranks; *zhuófēng* to abundant domains and prosperous counties. Though these affairs differ, they do not depart from the capital of Chu—just as *qi* gathers into *zang* to form life, then soon scatters in death. Unaware of heaven and earth’s subtle transformations, one clings to right and wrong, deeming life right and scattering wrong, or deeming primordial *qi* right and silent gathering wrong. Right and wrong have no fixed master, thus no definitive words can be spoken; it falls to the learner to discern and analyze.

The analogy is this: the coarse and foul viscera may be scattered, yet the great sacrifice with its complete offerings may not. The principle of life, death, *zang*, and scattering is the same. The ancestral temple and the privy further illustrate the mutability of rightness. Life is the root of right and wrong, knowledge their teacher—thus riding upon them leads to endless confusion. Taking name and reality as fixed, one clings to them as personal principles, even unto death without regard. Each simply deems their own rightness right—how does this differ from the cicada and turtledove sharing the same narrow view?

The *Yongzhai Oral Teachings* state: In the beginning of primordial beings, life and death, beginning and end, were undivided. Next came the names of life and death. To treat life as loss is to lodge temporarily within the realm of form; to treat death as return is to go back to one’s true dwelling. Once life and death exist, beings arise, and thus division begins. Above lies the realm without beings, the inception of the Great Ultimate. Next comes the advent of beings, when yin and yang divide. Following that comes life, and with it the self—though even with the self, life and death are treated as one. Though these three have sequence, none depart from the Dao, like the royal clan dividing into three, their surname remaining one. The Zhao and Jing clans became eminent through office, the Jia clan through enfeoffment. *Zhuódài* refers to holding office. Though Zhao, Jing, and Jia are not one clan, all belong to the royal house of Chu. The above speaks of the three differing yet sharing one royal lineage, then beneath the character "four" adds "not" to conclude—linking above and below, severing yet not severing, a marvel of composition.

*Zang* is the soot at the bottom of a cauldron, also a flaw or affliction. To say that no *qi* congeals to form a person is also a flaw in *qi*. This aligns with the notion that life is an ugly, belching thing. Humans share this *qi*, yet forcibly divide and claim their own rightness. "That of which one cannot speak" refers to each person having their own rightness, yet what is deemed right remains unsettled—thus unknowable.

The completeness of the *la* sacrifice’s *pìgāi* offerings, the wholeness of the sacrificial animal—during the ritual, the animal’s body is arranged upon the stands, called "scattering." Though the sacrificial animal is one and may not be scattered, this illustrates how human rightness shifts and remains unsettled. The five viscera are represented by the hundred leaves, the hundred limbs by the toes—a literary device. Just as within a single chamber there is the sleeping quarters, the ancestral shrine, and the place of repose, each different yet part of one room, so too does the mutability of rightness remain undetermined. Observing the *la* sacrifice and the chamber, one sees that all so-called rightness is mutable and unsettled—hence the term "shifting rightness."

To examine substance as human is to be bound to form; to return to the state before the advent of beings is not easy. All beings are illusions—when the mind abides, they abide; when the mind vanishes, they vanish. If my mind does not stir, standing solitary and serene, one may call it the state before the advent of beings. Should one attain this, then even life and death become mere lodgings—this the ancients who attained the Dao could achieve. Next comes the advent of beings and the division of life and death, yet those who treat life as loss and death as return differ from ordinary people adrift in the flow of life and death. Beyond this lies the state without division into life and death: head, body, and corpse—though these three differ, all emerge from the Dao, like the royal clan of Chu being one yet bearing the distinct surnames Zhao, Qu, and Jing. This refers to the proliferation of noble kinsmen and the diversity of enfeoffment systems, an analogy for the growth of knowledge and the expansion of desires.

*Piao* is the soot clinging to the cauldron’s bottom, seeming to have form yet not, arising from form. Humans lodge in form and have life—this too is like *zang*. Soon scattered, the so-called self shifts elsewhere, its existence or nonexistence undefinable. Thus, speaking of it is like the *la* sacrifice’s *pìgāi* offerings: the complete sacrificial animal may not be scattered, yet once the ritual ends, the portions may be distributed. In the ancestral temple, one stands in solemn reverence; in the privy, one cannot avoid a degree of irreverence. Life is the root of right and wrong, knowledge their guide—thus riding upon them leads to endless confusion. Taking name and reality as fixed, one clings to them as personal principles, even unto death without regard. Each simply deems their own rightness right—how does this differ from the cicada and turtledove sharing the same narrow view?

These are all transferable truths. The scriptural text once spoke of "transferring truth" in five characters, whose detailed meaning should precede the phrase "those things unknowable"—this is confirmed by Guo’s commentary. Humans deem themselves right because they possess life; with life comes knowledge, and knowledge serves as its guide. These two ride upon one another without cease. If one clings to them as name and reality, taking them as one’s personal essence, they become unchangeable—unable to shatter the illusory dust and recognize emptiness as real. Thus, treating name and reality as personal principles, even to the point of death in recompense, all stems from insisting on one’s own rightness, leading to this flaw. The world follows these habits without awakening to their error, no different from the cicada and turtledove sharing the same narrow flight between elm and sapanwood, unaware of the roc’s journey of ninety thousand miles.

**Miscellaneous Chapters: Gengsang Chu, Fifth**

When you tread upon a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, you apologize with an excuse of carelessness; if it is your elder brother, you merely smooth your feathers; if it is your closest kin, you let it pass. Thus it is said: the highest ritual does not treat others as others; the highest righteousness does not regard things as things; the highest wisdom does not scheme; the highest benevolence has no partiality; the highest trust dispenses with gold.

Dispel the turbulence of the will, untie the delusions of the heart, cast off the burdens of virtue, and clear the blockages of the Way. Wealth, honor, eminence, prestige, fame, and profit—these six are the turbulence of the will. Appearance, movement, countenance, principle, qi, and intent—these six are the delusions of the heart. Aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—these six are the burdens of virtue. Rejection, acceptance, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability—these six are the blockages of the Way. When these four sets of six are not stirred within the breast, one is upright; when upright, one is still; when still, one is luminous; when luminous, one is empty; when empty, one acts without acting and yet nothing is left undone.

The Way is the reverence of virtue; life is the radiance of virtue; nature is the substance of life. When nature moves, it is called action; when action is contrived, it is called error. Knowledge is contact; knowledge is planning; what knowledge does not know is like a sidelong glance.

To move only when unavoidable is called virtue; to move without self-exclusion is called governance. Names may be opposed, but realities are in accord.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
When treading upon a stranger, one claims a slip to apologize. With an elder brother, one bows in deference. With the closest kin, one says nothing—this shows plain forgiveness. "Not treating others as others" means seeing others as oneself. Without mutual apologies, this is the perfection of ritual. Righteousness means each attains its proper place, so all things are oneself. Wisdom that relies on scheming is not natural; it is like the five constants, which do not seek mutual closeness yet all arrive as one. Gold and jade are but petty tokens of trust; great trust transcends them. Movement arising from nature is called action—this is true action, not contrived. The eye does not know sight yet sees; the heart does not know knowing yet knows. This is the natural. To move only when unavoidable is not forced movement, so there is no error. To move by imitating others is disorder. With the names of self and other, there is opposition; when each attains its reality, there is accord.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
If a stranger draws a bow to shoot me, I speak of it with laughter, for there is no kindness between us, and I do not expect kindness. Thus, treading on a foot requires an apology of carelessness. If a brother draws a bow to shoot me, I speak of it with tears, for there is kindness between us, and I expect kindness. Thus, even treading on a foot does not seem unloving—one merely smooths one’s feathers. With the closest kin, no apology is needed, for kindness is complete, and smoothing is unnecessary. From this, we see that the perfection of ritual, righteousness, wisdom, and knowledge does not depend on externals. To know the meaning of ritual without following vulgar rites is to practice the ritual of not treating others as others. To act appropriately without seeking to suit things is the righteousness of not regarding things as things. To respond as things arise without prior scheming is the wisdom of not scheming. To treat the people as straw dogs and make the world forget distinctions is the benevolence of no partiality. To be trustworthy without relying on gold is the trust that dispenses with gold. If one attains the Way, these five perfections are all attained.

The will is where the heart goes; the heart is the harmony of virtue; virtue is the Way within me. Thus, dispelling the will precedes untying the heart; casting off burdens precedes clearing blockages. To cultivate the will, value weakness. To make wealth and honor one’s will is not weakness but perversity—it must be dispelled. To value the heart, value emptiness. To make appearance and movement the heart is not emptiness but delusion—it must be untied. Virtue’s perfection is to return to the origin; thus, desires and aversions are burdens of virtue—one must cast them off. The Way’s attainment is to penetrate the One; thus, rejection and acceptance are blockages of the Way—one must clear them. When all these burdens are not stirred within the breast, the Way gathers.

Without reverence, there is no Way, so the Way is the reverence of virtue. Without life, virtue cannot be seen, so life is the radiance of virtue. Nature is the substance of life. When nature moves, there is action; when action is contrived, there is error. Life does not inherently know action, so knowledge is contact, not innate with life. Knowledge used after planning is called scheming. What knowledge does not know is the self-knowing of knowledge, like the unglanced-at that enables the glance. Thus, to move only when unavoidable is nature’s action, not contrived error—this is called the Way. To move without self-exclusion is to unite with things—how can movement cause disorder? If one can be thus, then though the world’s self and other, right and wrong may seem opposed in name, in reality they are never discordant, for the Way excludes nothing.

**Yi Du’s Commentary:**
With kin bound by heaven, one does not mind disrespect; with others, one would. Thus, treading on a stranger requires an apology of carelessness; with a brother, one smooths one’s feathers; with a parent, one says nothing. From this, we see that words and apologies are not truly real. The highest ritual is like heaven, so it does not treat others as others. The highest righteousness forgets the self, so it does not regard things as things. The highest wisdom unites with things, so it does not scheme. The highest benevolence loves broadly, so it has no partiality. The highest trust is unwavering, so it dispenses with gold. Turbulence does not penetrate, so it must be dispelled. Delusion does not free, so it must be untied. Burdens obscure, so they must be cast off. Blockages are not empty, so they must be cleared. When these four sets of six are not stirred within, one is upright in the One. Upright, one is still; still, one is luminous; luminous, one is empty and unobstructed. How wondrous!

The Way that can be spoken of is the reverence of virtue. The life that can give life is the radiance of virtue. What is mandated within me is nature, the substance of life. When nature moves, all action is natural; contrivance is error, the cause of loss.

To engage with things and plan affairs through knowledge inevitably involves the use of knowing, yet even the wise have what they do not know, just as the sidelong-glancing have what they do not see. The spirit, however, knows all and sees all without exception. Nature arises from stillness; compelled by necessity, it responds to things—this is its movement. In movement, it does not lose correctness, allowing all things to attain their own fulfillment. How could there be disorder? Though compelled to move, it appears contrary, yet when all things attain their own fulfillment, it is truly in accord. *Bixu’s Commentary*: When one has caused harm or error to others, if the relationship is distant, one cannot avoid offering apologies; if close, one simply forgives. In the highest ritual, forgetting the self brings order; the presence of others brings chaos. In the highest righteousness, holding fast to integrity preserves the self, but attachment to things causes loss. In the highest wisdom, clarity arises without thought; excessive scheming leads to confusion. In the highest benevolence, all things are as straw dogs, and closeness or distance are the same. In the highest trust, one never breaks a promise—how could gold or jade be needed as surety? Wealth and honor cannot disturb one whose will is unobstructed. Demeanor and movement cannot entangle one whose heart is empty. Desires and aversions cannot bind one whose virtue is profound. Advancement and retreat cannot rigidly obstruct one whose Dao is luminous. When no affairs disturb the numinous inner chamber, one is utterly clear and spiritually luminous, gazing afar into the vast desert of the world. How could the exhaustion of deliberate action drown one? Those who rely on what is described struggle to accompany the formless. The withered and desiccated are cursed to compare with the flourishing and radiant. Without nature, there would be no being; from what could being arise? How upright is its essence! Seeing, hearing, eating, and resting—all are acts of nature. Yet these acts are not true action, for they are the loss of the Dao. Thus, one does not engage or discourse—what need is there for knowledge? The wise, in what they commonly know, know indeed; but in what they do not know, they are utterly at a loss—like one who squints and cannot see straight. Moved only when pressed, in movement one attains. The real, when used to govern the self, what does it not govern? Inner and outer, self and things, are like east and west—opposite yet unable to do without one another. *Yongzhai’s “Righteousness”*: The highest ritual, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence do not depend on external things.

Here the metaphor of "heel and foot" gathers its meaning in the following four-six rhythm, which must not sway within the breast—this is where one begins to practice. *Qin* (reverence) is the solemnity of holding fast. *Sheng* (life) is the manifestation of virtue. That nature resides within me is the original substance of my being. When nature acts, and action drifts into falsity, then it is lost. Responding to things, planning, and deliberating—all are the knowing within nature. Yet those who claim knowledge of what they do not know are like infants squinting without seeing. All movement and action, when done only out of necessity, may be called virtue—this is the forgetting of the self. Within this forgetting of the self, there is nothing that is not the self. This is the form within the formless, the formless within form. When things cannot disturb it, it is called governance; when it is necessity, when nothing is not the self—these names seem contradictory yet are never truly at odds. This is another way of speaking.

To distinguish respect and awe by nearness or distance is but the ritual of the vulgar world, mere pretense. Constant reverence lies in one’s elder brother; momentary respect lies in a village acquaintance. With one’s closest kin, love and respect abide without need for explanation. Even if one stumbles in heel or foot, no question remains—thus the highest ritual, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence do not depend on external things or actions but attain their perfection spontaneously. This arises from the natural principle of heaven, allowing no deliberation, and those who practice it follow the same track.

As for dissolving the will and freeing the mind, removing burdens and clearing obstructions—this belongs to human effort and is a step lower. The four-six rhythm must not sway within, revealing the essentials of entering the Way. From rectitude comes stillness, enabling response to the world’s movement. From clarity comes emptiness, enabling the world’s fullness to be contained. Thus, what was earlier called the highest ritual and righteousness is seamless and converges with the Dao.

Virtue is what things revere; the Dao, in turn, is what virtue reveres—its loftiness is thus known. Life is the radiance of virtue; righteousness should be the radiance of virtue’s life. If one lacks virtue, how can there be life? That things are given life is called virtue. Nature is the substance of life; that form and spirit each preserve their proper pattern is called nature. When nature moves, it is called action; thus, to know non-action is to know that nature has never truly moved. When action becomes falsity, it is called loss; thus, to know action is to know that it has never been truly real.

The world’s men of knowledge engage with things, plotting and scheming, fearing only that their engagement is too narrow and their knowledge too shallow. They exhaust their bodies and spirits yet fail to realize that what they do not know is precisely what they claim to know—like one who squints and sees nothing, yet boasts of seeing all. Thus, in responding to things and handling affairs, one must act only out of necessity, then it arises from nature’s spontaneity and is without loss. This is the opposite of worldly names yet in truth accords with them. As *Laozi* says: "True words seem contradictory." This is how those with the Way differ from the vulgar and can engage with things without harm.

Yi was skilled at hitting the smallest target yet clumsy at making others praise him. The sage is skilled at heaven yet clumsy at man. Only the *quanren* (whole person) can be skilled at heaven and yet stubborn with man. Only the insect can be an insect; only the insect can be heaven. Does the *quanren* hate heaven? Does he hate man’s heaven? How much more his own heaven or man’s! When a sparrow comes before Yi, Yi must catch it—such is his power. But if the world is made his cage, the sparrow has nowhere to flee. Thus, Tang used a kitchen servant to cage Yi Yin, and Duke Mu of Qin used five sheepskins to cage Baili Xi. Thus, there is nothing that cannot be caged by what it loves.

The hunchbacked adorn themselves with elaborate patterns, yet this is not for praise. The convict laborer climbs high without fear, having abandoned life and death. To return to speech without offering and forget others—this is to forget others and thereby become one with heaven and man. Thus, one who is revered feels no joy, and one who is insulted feels no anger—only one in harmony with heaven’s accord is so. Anger that arises from non-anger is anger born of non-anger; action that arises from non-action is action born of non-action. To desire stillness, calm the qi; to desire spirit, follow the heart—this is action. To desire rightness, abide in necessity; necessity is the way of the sage.

Guo’s commentary: Skill in hitting the mark leads to praise—this is the constant principle. Following nature is heaven; acting with intention is man. To be skilled at heaven is to be clumsy with man. The *quanren* is the sage. That the insect can be an insect is to be able to be heaven—this is to be utterly without knowledge yet follow it, which is called skill at heaven. Power compels things, and things must follow; all things in the world have their loves, and each attains what it loves—where then can they flee? Adornment enhances appearance, but the amputee’s form is already maimed, so he no longer cares for beauty or ugliness and discards it. The convict laborer has no attachment to life, so he does not fear death. To return to speech without offering and forget others is to be ignorant of what others value, devoid of human sentiment, and thus naturally one with heaven and man. If even the mutilated convict laborer can be in harmony with heaven’s accord, how much more the natural accord of heaven? Anger arising from non-anger, action arising from non-action—this is the idea that the non-existent gives rise to the existent, and the existent cannot become non-existent.

To calm the qi is to be still; to fulfill principle and follow the heart is to be spirit. To perfect action by abiding in necessity is to act rightly in all things. The sage takes this as the Way—how could he seek non-action beyond the indistinct? Lü’s commentary: The scriptures speak of heaven-men, spirit-men, perfect men, and sages—here there is also the *quanren*. The sage flees transformation, skilled at heaven yet clumsy with man. The *quanren* surpasses even this, skilled at heaven yet stubborn with man.

Crawling and pecking, flocking and herding—such are the abilities of creatures. Unaware of why they do what they do, yet doing it, is the creatures’ accord with heaven. What the *quanren* detests is the heaven of men. The heaven of men knows what it does not know; the heaven of heaven forgets even what it does not know. If one detests even what one does not know, how much more would one detest measuring heaven and man with human judgment?

When a sparrow strays into Yi’s snare, it is caught by his might; those that do not stray are not caught by his might. If one takes all under heaven as a cage, then the myriad things are all ensnared and have nowhere to escape—how much more a mere sparrow? Only one who delves deeply and profoundly enough to penetrate the minds of all under heaven can take all under heaven as a cage. Thus, even figures like Yi Yin and Baili Xi could not escape, for they were caged by what they loved.

The crippled man, though scorned and praised by others, can still alter his adornments and refuse to follow convention. The convict laborer, though facing life and death, can still climb heights without fear—how much more one who can forget others? It is fitting that he neither flatters nor repays. Through repeated practice, one may still be unable to forget what others cannot help but feel ashamed of, yet forgetting others is but the means to becoming a heaven-man. Clearly, the heaven-man is not merely one who forgets others; forgetting others is but the path to it. This is the same as the knowledge of heaven—fitting that he respects without delight and is insulted without anger.

Anger often arises from non-anger, action often arises from non-action. In non-anger and non-action, there has never yet been anything, yet from them all things arise. Qi is emptiness awaiting things; when man cannot calm it but instead agitates it, it does not become still. If one can truly calm the qi, there is nothing that does not become still. The heart in man is spirit; when man cannot follow it but instead disturbs it, it does not become spirit. If one can truly follow the heart, there is nothing that does not become spirit.

To act rightly is to be true to oneself. Hesitating to undertake affairs, as if crossing a river in winter—all this is the meaning of necessity. *Yi Du Zhu*: To gain men through might yields little; to gain men through the heart yields much. To take them by archery is might; to cage them by what they love is virtue. Yi Yin loved to season the cauldron, so he carried the cauldron to offer himself to Tang, and Tang caged him as a cook. Baili Xi loved the five-colored sheep pelt, so Duke Mu of Qin caged him with five-colored sheep pelts. Thus, each won their hearts and put them to use.

The crippled man, a petty person, adorns his exterior; the petty man has already forgotten his form and bones, scorning praise and blame without weariness. When practice reaches completion and one no longer repays one’s teacher, one has forgotten the way of man, and from forgetting the way of man, one takes oneself to have entered the realm of heaven. Man cannot escape the obstruction of partiality; if one has not forgotten the self, there is always something that binds. Respected, he delights; insulted, he angers. Only one in harmony with heaven’s accord feels joy or anger not from respect or insult but in accord with the order or chaos of all under heaven. King Wu’s anger brought peace to all under heaven—this anger arose from non-anger.

Since anger arises from non-anger, action likewise arises from non-action. Thus, one does not agitate the qi but keeps one’s nature still; one does not oppose the heart but keeps one’s spirit whole. Desiring that all affairs be right, one acts from necessity—this is the sage’s way of responding to things. *Bixu Zhu*: One skilled at the mean is clumsy at concealing praise; one wondrous in naturalness is distant from human artifice. When the traces of heaven-men and men alike vanish, this is the *quanren*.

Creatures often name themselves by their abilities, while flying and running without substitution is called the ability of heaven. The *quanren* detests heaven, not using the mind to follow the Dao; detests the heaven of men, not using man to aid heaven—how much less would he care for men’s praise of skill or blame of clumsiness! A bird mistakenly enters Yi’s snare, just as a scholar inevitably enters the cage of the state. Yi gains birds through might, and Yi’s might kills the birds; the state gains scholars and prospers, while the state’s prosperity wearies the scholars. Gain and loss follow the principle of nature. Yi Yin and Baili Xi could not be without desires or forget their loves, so they were caged by Tang and Duke Mu. If the heart has no loves, how could it be caged?

Those who adorn their appearance delight in praise; those who value life fear death. One who repeatedly practices and cherishes without repayment has forgotten human affairs. When practice becomes second nature, and one takes it as natural, it is like the crippled man scorning praise and blame, or the convict laborer disregarding life and death. When humiliated, what room is there for joy or anger? One whose nature is in harmony with heaven’s accord is the same. If anger does not arise, it festers and grows; when it arises, it vanishes without a trace. If action does not act, it frustrates the desire to act; when it acts, it becomes vast and non-active. This is because the original nature is without anger and without action.

Calming the qi and stilling perception—what is there to be angry about? Following the heart and settling the spirit—what is there to act upon? When movement arises from necessity, it accords with affairs—this is the sage’s Dao. *Yanzhai Kouyi*: Yi cannot prevent men from praising themselves, just as the sage cannot escape the world’s renown. One who can fully embody heaven’s Dao and yet conceal his traces among men—this is the person of complete virtue.

Creatures’ flying, running, calling, and leaping each follow their nature—these are the abilities of creatures and the abilities of heaven. The *quanren* does not name himself by heaven, detesting heaven as disliking to bear its name. If even one who distinguishes between heaven and man in himself detests it, how much more would I distinguish between heaven and man? Yi was skilled at archery, so men feared him; if one takes all under heaven as a cage, the sparrow need not wait to be shot. Yi Yin and Baili Xi were also caged by what they loved; if they had no loves, they would have transcended things—who could cage them?

The hunchbacked man removes his ornate adornments, for his heart has already cast aside praise and blame.

The men of *xumi*, *chengdan*, and *chong*—who care not for their bodies—ascend heights without fear, for when the heart holds no attachment, there is nothing to cling to. This is like the *Yi*’s "reversal of the Dao." *Wei* means "to practice"; *kui* means "to give to others." This Dao resides within oneself—it is not merchandise to be sold. To know it for oneself is to forget others; to forget others is to enter into heaven.

In the *Xu Wugui* chapter, "I must sell it," yet they still treat it as constant—from this one may understand the meaning of "not giving." To be in harmony with the harmony of heaven is to become one with the Creator. Anger arises not from anger; to act in the world yet hold no concern is to be "non-active yet nothing is not done." The shift in phrasing below—"only when compelled does one act"—speaks of responding to things without intent.

If Yi were not skilled at archery, how could men praise him? If the sage were not skilled at governance, how could the people turn to him? Yet when things turn to one, one becomes burdened; where there is skill, there is clumsiness—this is an inevitable principle. To be skilled in heaven and clumsy in man is still acceptable; but to be skilled in man and clumsy in heaven is to be wholly entangled in human desire—what then can be done? Thus, to be skilled in heaven and stubborn in man is to be complete and free from the cares of the hidden and the manifest.

At dawn, the damp transforms; in due time, creatures fly and crawl—these are the abilities of creatures. The crow’s kindness, the magpie’s friendship, the spider’s web, the spider’s pellet—these are the abilities of heaven. That man can possess both the abilities of man and of heaven may likewise be inferred.

The complete person detests "heaven"—detests man’s division of himself to become heaven, not the natural heaven itself. How much less would he divide himself into heaven and man? He must conceal man within heaven, blending them into one—this is how he attains complete virtue and escapes the burdens of the world.

A single sparrow comes to Yi, and Yi seizes it by force. To seize things by force is not as abundant as seizing them without intent. If one takes all under heaven as a cage, what is gained is not merely a sparrow. Only when there is something loved can one be caged; with utter indifference and no desire, how can one be caged?

The hunchback does not wish for adornment; the convict does not fear death—both are remnants of punishment, despised by others, yet they have no intent to preserve life, no choice but to endure. But when this endures long enough, the heart holds no shame or fear, forgetting what others cannot forget, and thus entering into the natural. This speaks of dwelling in stillness long enough to become at ease and transformed. How much more so for one who is rooted in the natural and possesses the abilities of both heaven and man? Their transcendence of the dust and solitary awakening—who can measure it?

Trivial external respects and insults—how could they disturb a vast and unshaken heart? To be in harmony with the harmony of heaven is to possess the ability of man to become heaven. When anger arises without anger, what passes is transformed. When action arises from non-action, affairs are accomplished without record. The sage is not without joy or anger, nor without action; yet things do not arise from trifles, so his responses are not for private gain but move with the moment. With single-mindedness, he nurtures his *qi* to ride the opportunities of things—angry where anger is due, acting where action is due—taking the hearts of the people as his own heart. In encouraging good and punishing evil, it is as if he neither angers nor acts.

When *qi* is level and still, the heart is compliant and the spirit at peace. He responds only when moved, acts only when pressed—how could there be anything amiss? The classic text’s "not giving" is hard to explain; one version reads "not ashamed," which I follow here.

Gengsang Chu, compared to Laozi, embodied the whole in miniature, yet what he had not yet attained still stood out distinctly. Dwelling in Weilěi, the people praised his virtue—this is the common way of sages and worthies in benefiting things. But when the hearts of the multitude rejoice and wish to exalt him, the advance of love and benefit becomes conspicuous, and when things interact, emotions arise. Thus, Nanrong’s perception was still like that of Weilěi.

Gengsang feared his virtue was insufficient to transform, so he sent him to see his teacher, intending to shift his heart and awaken him. This was like passing the baton to another, ensuring trust without doubt, so that the profound words could enter. Thus, upon entering the gate, there was a single rebuke, a shout—no questions, no answers—both were lost. Like letting go at a cliff’s edge, where the root of life is severed—how rare is such an encounter!

Alas, Nanrong could not directly accept it but instead rambled and digressed, expounding at length. Laozi diagnosed the source of his illness and sharply admonished him. Nanrong withdrew, gathered himself, washed and reappeared—one might say he was good at receiving teaching and able to renew himself. Thus, in their next encounter, Laozi seized the moment to point directly, completely removing his clinging to cleverness, and gradually applied the medicine.

Zhao Zikui’s capacity for the Dao was shallow; he only wished to hear the classic of preserving life. Yet the Dao’s methods of filling and broadening lie within man’s ears. Laozi taught him to embrace the One, to seek himself, to return to infancy, and to follow things. The classic of preserving life is revealed here. When questioning reaches its limit, it returns to "Can you be like a child?"—words have their source, affairs have their lord.

Next, he discusses the vastness of the universe, issuing from the light of heaven, and the numinous terrace, which holds nothing. This means the chamber is empty and whiteness arises—one must not eagerly seek with a heart of intention and action. The explanations of "external and internal contracts," the metaphors of "overstepping and usurping"—these further teach scholars to know weight and add selection.

There is no birth or death; in sequence and priority, all are of one body. The ancestral temple and the privy, the exalted and the lowly—each has its proper place. This is to awaken to the truth that the root of life has no existence, and to break the delusion of shifting identities.

As for the uncle’s esteem, the rich man’s desires, the evil man’s ambitions, and the confused man’s heart—one knows that the will must be unified and the heart must be empty. Whatever involves the burdens of things and obstructs emptiness and clarity must be abandoned and kept far away—this is how one preserves one’s heaven and returns to the Dao.

The offerings at the winter sacrifice are complete yet may be scattered and are not constant. Yi was skilled at hitting the mark yet clumsy at concealing his reputation—these all dissolve the common views of clinging, expand the transformative power of the mysterious, blend the skill and clumsiness of heaven and man, and transcend the distinctions of things, self, right, and wrong. Forgetting praise and blame, respect and insult, one arrives at "not acting" and "not angering."

When still, one nurtures the balanced qi and preserves its vastness by not disturbing it; when spiritually attuned, one follows the heart’s love of harmony and aversion to deceit. Thus, one dwells in serene solitude with the divine luminaries, stabilized in unity and responding without fixed direction.

This is the profound transmission of heart-mind that Old Lão bestowed upon Gēng-Sāng, just as there were truths between Yánzi and the Master that could not be voiced. *Nán-Huá* revived the lost learning a hundred years later, and Mèng’s school, upon hearing it, knew its truth—practice to the utmost, and success is one. Therefore, it is held forth as the model for all under heaven.

**Xú Wúguǐ, the First**

Xú Wúguǐ, through Nǚ Shāng, gained audience with Lord Wǔ of Wèi. The lord greeted him, saying, “Master, you are worn out! Have you wearied yourself in the mountains and forests, and so now deign to see me?”

Xú Wúguǐ replied, “It is I who have wearied you—what weariness have you for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, the natural sentiments of your life will sicken. If you suppress your desires and learn your likes and dislikes, your ears and eyes will sicken. I weary you—what weariness have you for me?”

Lord Wǔ, startled, made no reply.

After a moment, Xú Wúguǐ said, “Let me tell you: I read dogs. Those of low quality stop when full—this is the virtue of a wildcat. Those of middling quality seem to gaze at the sun. Those of high quality seem to have forgotten their oneness. In reading dogs, I am not as skilled as reading horses. In reading horses, the straight meet the plumb line, the curved meet the hook, the square meet the carpenter’s square, the round meet the compass—these are state horses, yet they do not compare to the horses of all under heaven. The horses of all under heaven have fully developed their material; they seem anxious, seem lost, seem to have forgotten their oneness. Such as these surpass all bounds, leaving dust behind, and none know where they go.”

Lord Wǔ was greatly pleased and laughed.

When Xú Wúguǐ departed, Nǚ Shāng asked, “Master, how did you alone delight our lord? When I delight our lord, I expound horizontally with the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, or follow vertically with the *Golden Tablets* and *Six Canons*. Those who serve him and achieve great merit are beyond counting, yet our lord never so much as parts his lips. How did you delight our lord so that he was pleased like this?”

Xú Wúguǐ said, “I simply told him about reading dogs and horses.”

Nǚ Shāng said, “Is that all?”

Xú Wúguǐ replied, “Have you not heard of the exiles of Yuè? After a few days away from their state, they rejoice at seeing those they know. After a month away, they rejoice at seeing those they once saw in their state. After a year, they rejoice even at seeing those who resemble people. Is it not that the longer one is parted from others, the deeper the longing for them? Those who flee into emptiness, though their paths be strewn with blossoms and lined with pillars, tread the void, and when they hear the sound of human footsteps in the hall, they rejoice—how much more so when brothers and kin drink and feast at their side? For how long has no true person’s words feasted at our lord’s side?”

Guō’s commentary: The ears and eyes, in their likes and dislikes, find nothing within or without—hence, they are sick. “Startled, he made no reply” means he was displeased with the words. Yet what is there to yield in the words of a true person? Only things have likes that can be indulged. Expounding horizontally and vertically, the lord never parted his lips—this is like delighting in cranes with bells and drums, hence the sorrow. Hearing about reading dogs and horses and rejoicing is like one who leaves their state and sees those they know, each longing for what their nature loves. When one attains what they love, there is no longing; without longing, one forgets the cause of their joy. The words of a true person attain our lord’s nature—first attaining it, he rejoices; attaining it long, he forgets.

Lǚ’s commentary: Wúguǐ forgot Lord Wǔ’s power and admonished his illness; Lord Wǔ, because Wúguǐ did not humble himself, was startled and made no reply. Wúguǐ used the analogy of reading dogs and horses to express his lack of demands. Dogs of low quality stop when full, like people who, when hungry, are useful and have demands. Those of middling quality seem to gaze at the sun, like those who look high and far yet cannot forget themselves. Forgetting oneness means forgetting oneself can be known. Horses that meet the compass, square, hook, and plumb line are state horses, comparable to state scholars who roam within the bounds. The horses of all under heaven have fully developed their material, untrained yet natural—they seem anxious, as if none share their joy; seem lost, as if none match them. Seeming to have forgotten their oneness is to forget the self entirely, not merely to lose it. Surpassing all bounds, leaving dust behind, none know their whereabouts—how much more so for the scholars of all under heaven who roam beyond bounds and cannot be known? The meaning is: if even the high quality of dogs and the horses of all under heaven are like this, how could I know your power and humble myself before you? How could you not read me?

Lord Wǔ grasped his meaning, hence his great delight. Speech is the means by which the Dao is met.

Words not aligned with the Dao, though drawn from the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, or *Music*, cannot move the heart; words aligned with the Dao, though merely about judging dogs or horses, suffice to bring delight.

When one loses the true nature of life and indulges in human artifice, it is like leaving one’s homeland and kin to wander in distant lands—akin to fleeing into the void, forever restless among weasels and martens. What is called "true" is the inherent nature of one’s being, like the familiar bonds of homeland and kin. Is there anyone so madly deluded as to hear the voice of a true person and not rejoice?

**Yi Du’s Annotation:**
Wu Gui was a recluse of Wei. Nü Shang was a chief minister of Wei. Wu Hou was the son of Wen Hou. Wu Hou, pitying Wu Gui for the toils of mountain and forest life, expressed his concern upon meeting him. Wu Gui replied: though dwelling in mountains and forests, I have never known toil. Now, my lord, when your desires overflow, the true nature of life suffers; when you suppress desires, the faculties of ear and eye suffer—these two afflictions cannot be escaped. Thus, I weary you, not you me. Wu Hou made no reply, resisting in his heart.

Wu Gui, knowing he could not speak of great matters, instead used the art of judging dogs and horses—appealing to his lord’s predilections—to strike the mark.

**On the Qualities of Dogs:**
The lowly quality: sated with food yet devoid of ability.
The middling quality: aspirations lofty and far-reaching.
The highest quality: as if having forgotten their oneness.

"Oneness" is the essence of all numbers; to forget even this is profound—how much more so for the coarse. Next, the judging of horses: "meeting the line," "hooked," "compassed," "square"—all are methods of training. The horses of all under heaven possess fully formed material, so one does not speak of "square" or "round," "curved" or "straight." Their gaze seems anxious, as if troubled; their bearing seems lost, as if unmatched. These may still be discerned by form. But when they forget their oneness, they surpass all bounds, leave dust behind, and none know their whereabouts.

**On Persuasion:**
That which goes against the grain is "contrary"; that which follows is "compliant." Wu Hou favored martial arts and despised culture, so Nü Shang called the *Six Classics* "contrary" and military strategy "compliant," seeking to align with his lord’s inclinations. He further cited the example of an exile from Yue: at first, after leaving his homeland for days, he rejoiced at seeing acquaintances; after a month, he rejoiced at seeing those he had seen before; after a year, long parted from his countrymen, his longing deepened—even seeing one who merely resembled a fellow villager brought joy. How much more so for one who flees calamity into the emptiness of the wild, where weeds choke the paths of weasels and martens, and all traces of human presence vanish? At such a time, even hearing the sound of footsteps—let alone the voices of brothers and kin laughing at one’s side—would bring boundless joy. Wu Hou’s heart had long cherished dogs and horses, so hearing of one skilled in judging them brought delight, though he had yet to witness the truth of it. Thus, having long been deprived of worthy words and voices in his presence, he rejoiced even at this humble art.

**Bi Xu’s Annotation:**
"When desires overflow, the true nature of life suffers; when desires are suppressed, the faculties of ear and eye suffer"—this is what was earlier called "inner and outer loss." "As if lost" and "as if forgotten" both denote a lack of self-possession. To forget one’s oneness is not as severe as to lose it entirely.

For the discussion here borrows dogs and horses merely as a starting point—how could these be considered the ultimate aim? Its true purpose is to reverse the inclinations of Wu Hou, first drawing him in through coarse matters before guiding him toward the subtle and profound.

**Wu Chou’s Annotation:**
The "ghostless" refers to the spirit-like person, who seizes the moment and rides the momentum without allowing the heart to intervene. Thus, the speaker’s words, though silent, convey deeper meaning: following the return of the Dao without opposing its principles, accommodating another’s preferences without clashing with their nature. Even Wu Hou’s harsh and violent temper yields to joy and laughter, for the analogy is rooted in the Way.

**Yongzhai’s Oral Exegesis:**
"Raccoon virtue" describes a nature like that of a raccoon, the basest of dogs. "Gazing at the sun" means fixing one’s stare upward without blinking. "The One" is the nature of life—though alive, it seems dead, like the wooden rooster, the highest grade of horse. "Complying with the compass, square, hook, and plumb line" signifies that each part conforms to the rule, without rigidly seeking exactness. "Village of completion" refers to natural, heaven-born perfection. "As if anxious, as if lost" conveys a state of absentmindedness. "Losing the One" is the same as "forgetting the One." Thus, "transcending the dust and leaving no trace" describes a destination beyond knowing—all these are borrowed metaphors.

*The Six Bow-Cases* refers to *Tai Gong’s Art of War*. "Golden tablets" is akin to saying "stored in a golden casket." "Service with merit" means that one’s actions yield tangible results. The analogy of "flowing into exile from the state" requires no explanation. "Voice and swallowing" refers to the sounds within the throat.

Chu Shi’s Humble Insights:
Dogs and horses are common livestock, their abilities no more than guarding against thieves or serving as mounts—even if one selects them with the keenest eye and discerns their true nature, this hardly amounts to an extraordinary skill. Yet when Marquis Wu heard of it, he was greatly pleased. Why? The more adept the persuader, the more he must seize upon his listener’s preferences to ensnare him, making his words easier to accept—just as a king fond of warfare is swayed by military analogies.

Ponder the phrase “village of completion” applied to the world’s horses: one can imagine the bearing of a steed that transcends the dust and leaves no trace. Even the arts of Bo Le and Jiu Fang Gao would here find nothing left to appraise. To say “losing the One” may still be describable; but to speak of “forgetting the One” is to capture a state so elusive it defies depiction—unlike the state of a fine state-bred horse, which can be likened to compass, square, hook, and plumb line.

The “One” is the first sprouting of things. “As if lost, as if forgotten” suggests a realm between presence and absence, where form and substance cannot be pinned down. Only by awakening to the Dao can one win Marquis Wu’s heart, and the effect is swifter than that of the *Odes*, the *Documents*, or the *Six Bow-Cases*.

The later analogy of exile—longing for one’s homeland—implies that those who have lost their nature will inevitably seek to recover it. If someone seizes the moment to rouse them, how different is this from hearing the sound of footsteps in a vast, empty land? “For so long now…” expresses regret that no one has offered profound words and subtle truths to move Marquis Wu’s heart, so that he delights in hearing about the physiognomy of dogs and horses. Were a worthy minister to draw near and gradually transform him with the whispered teachings of virtue, I know his innate goodness would return like water flowing back to the abyss—vast and unstoppable. Thus, the gentleman does not reject any who would purify their hearts and turn toward goodness.

Some may doubt that Xu Wugui was a worthy man: upon meeting Marquis Wu, he suddenly spoke of dogs and horses, seemingly without purpose. But Marquis Wu was habitually arrogant, so loyal ministers could not approach, and the words of true men went unheard. Xu Wugui sought an audience intending to correct him, yet the Marquis treated him as an ordinary scholar. Thus, he expounded: “I can discern the strengths and weaknesses of dogs and horses and decide which to keep or discard—how could you, my lord, fail to recognize the worth of men and treat them with due respect?” This was the unspoken meaning behind his words.

When Xu Wugui met Marquis Wu, the Marquis said: “Master, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating taro and chestnuts, weary of onions and leeks, yet you deign to visit this lonely one—how long it has been! Are you now old? Do you crave the taste of wine and meat? Or does this lonely one possess some blessing for the altars of soil and grain?”

Xu Wugui replied: “Xu Wugui was born poor and lowly; I have never dared to partake of your lordship’s wine and meat. I come to labor on your behalf.”

The Marquis said: “What do you mean? How do you labor for this lonely one?”

He replied: “I labor your spirit and your form.”

Marquis Wu said: “What does that mean?”

Xu Wugui said: “The nurturing of Heaven and Earth is one. Standing high does not make one tall; dwelling low does not make one short. Yet you alone, as lord of ten thousand chariots, exhaust the people of your state to indulge your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. The spirit does not permit this. The spirit loves harmony and detests deceit. Deceit is a sickness—thus, I labor to cure it. It is you, my lord, who suffer from this sickness. Why?”

Marquis Wu said: “I have long wished to meet you, Master. I desire to love the people, practice righteousness, and lay down arms—is this possible?”

Xu Wugui said: “It is not. Loving the people is the beginning of harming them. Practicing righteousness and laying down arms is the root of raising arms. If you proceed thus, you will surely fail. All completed beauty is a dangerous tool. Though you act with benevolence and righteousness, you verge on hypocrisy! Form inevitably gives rise to form; completion inevitably invites attack; change inevitably leads to external conflict. Do not parade splendid battle formations between the watchtowers; do not station swift cavalry in the ancestral temples; do not harbor rebellion within success; do not seek to outwit others; do not seek to outmaneuver others; do not seek to overcome others through warfare. Those who kill the people, seize their lands, and nourish their own selfishness and spirit through war—how can one say which side is good? Where does victory lie? If you cannot stop, my lord, cultivate sincerity within your heart to respond to the feelings of Heaven and Earth, and do not obstruct it. The people are already dead and free—what use will you have for laying down arms?”

Guo’s Commentary:
Heaven and Earth nurture all equally, not favoring the ruler, yet you indulge without limit. To exhaust the people to indulge your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth is to violate the balance of Heaven and Earth. The spirit does not permit itself; it is the things that grant it. To share with things is harmony; to permit oneself is deceit. The path of “loving the people” is what the people esteem, but loving oneself is hypocrisy. Hypocrisy spreads names and sparks competition; fathers and sons, rulers and ministers, will harbor doubts and deceive one another—how can one then lay down arms? Only by acting through non-action can this be achieved. Beauty completed in the past gives rise to hypocrisy later; the people will follow with hypocrisy. Benevolence and righteousness have form, hence hypocrisy. Form must be crafted, thus it is conspicuous. “Change” means losing what is constant. “Crane formations” are battle arrays. “Watchtowers” are high towers. Infantry are called “foot soldiers.” One should not lay down arms for the sake of righteousness, nor should one amass troops or race horses. To harbor rebellion within success is to lose it.

To preserve its uncarved simplicity is to keep it level, for simplicity has its own capacity. To follow genuine knowledge as knowledge, each with its own excellence, is to keep it balanced. Responding to things through the Dao, things submit without claim to victory. Not knowing what constitutes goodness, even conquest is no true victory for oneself. If one cannot yet cease, then nothing surpasses cultivating one’s own sincerity. Let weapons remain unstationed, yet this is not disarmament.

Lu’s commentary: To govern the state with knowledge is the state’s bane; to govern the state without knowledge is the state’s blessing. Thus, loving the people is indeed the beginning of harming them, and disarmament is indeed the root of creating weapons—for it is done through knowledge, not the Dao. When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness is already present; thus, achieving beauty is inherently an instrument of ugliness. As an instrument, it has already strayed far from the Dao. Even with the benevolence of loving the people or the righteousness of disarmament, it is but hypocrisy. The form of loving the people inherently invites attack, becoming the beginning of harming them; the form of disarmament inherently leads to external war, becoming the root of creating weapons. Only without form is there nothing to create.

When crane formations are arrayed upon watchtowers, they are admired and observed. When foot soldiers and warhorses are paraded upon drill grounds, they are played with and observed. This is not using them out of necessity. If one nearly attains success yet does not follow the principle of heaven, then rebellion is concealed within that attainment. To overcome others with cunning schemes is to rely on knowledge rather than the Dao. To overcome others through war is to rely on military strength rather than virtue. Killing people and seizing land to nourish one’s private desires and one’s spirit—self-interest is self-approval, while the spirit detests and afflicts it. To call conquering others through war “good” is to not know where true goodness lies in overcoming evil.

If a ruler must act out of necessity, let him cultivate sincerity to respond to the feelings of heaven and earth, and all things will respond—how then could the people’s deaths not be averted?

Du’s commentary: Heaven and earth are the greatest of formed things, yet what they nourish is the One. The One is the origin; the *Book of Changes* speaks of the origin of Qian and the origin of Kun, which even heaven and earth revere—how much more should humans? The Dao of heaven and earth takes levelness as correctness; ascending high or dwelling low, what distinction is there in short or long? Now, if a ruler occupies the heights to exalt himself, oppresses the people to nourish himself, suffers external attacks from traitors, and loses his inner spirit, the spirit does not approve—this is why he is afflicted and cannot but toil.

Marquis Wu again asked about loving the people and disarmament. When the path of loving the people becomes conspicuous, the people compete to regard love as benevolence—this is the beginning of harm. Acting for righteousness makes names prominent, and prominent names spark competition; thus, it is called the root of creating weapons. These are all actions of deliberate doing, hence perilous and unachievable. When simplicity scatters, it becomes instruments; instruments, once formed, have beauty and ugliness. Now, even if one wishes to practice benevolence and righteousness, all are unavoidably hypocritical. Form is what things take. This is creating form; once formed, there is merit, and merit inevitably invites attack. Change means losing one’s constant guard, and profit and desire wage war externally.

Crane formations are the image of deploying troops. Watchtowers are places to observe troops. Drill grounds are where troops train. Success for oneself is rebellion against others—this is concealing rebellion within attainment. Cunning arises from the sprouting of scheming within; though it may overcome others, it does not benefit oneself. Plotting stems from doubt and fear, unsettled. War is killing people to seek victory—all these harm what one nourishes and should not be done. Using this to nourish one’s private desires cannot fulfill them; using this to nourish one’s spirit cannot preserve it.

Though victory in war may be achieved, it is not the Way of true victory. Only by cultivating sincerity to align with Heaven and Earth and refraining from contention can the people avoid premature death and injury—why then insist on righteousness to lay down arms?

Bi Xu’s commentary: Marquis Wu long indulged in desires and forgot his root, so Wu Gui spoke bluntly of exhausting his lord’s form and spirit. Heaven and Earth nurture humanity as one; ruler and people are originally undivided. Now, however, the deficient are depleted to serve the excess—this is contrary to principle. The spirit of humanity and the spirit of Heaven share the same ultimate impartiality. To claim it as one’s private possession is what is called treachery. The people follow the ruler’s transformation; if the ruler ails, the people suffer—hence the admonition.

Marquis Wu then asked about the essentials of righteousness and laying down arms. As fish in a dried-up stream long for moisture, so people in hardship and want yearn for benevolence and righteousness. The answer: love, when esteemed, leads to inequality and much harm; righteousness, when established, invites conflict and loss—all are undone by those who enact them, bringing peril and little success. The Dao is lost, then benevolence arises; virtue is lost, then righteousness arises. When benevolence and righteousness are exalted, the people’s nature is altered, and falsity is born.

As for crane formations, watchtowers, and drill grounds—these are not the foundations of lasting peace and are not worthy of esteem. Following Heaven’s principle averts loss and death; indulging in martial affairs breeds ambition for conquest. Excessive cunning leads to early exhaustion; extreme warfare invites dynastic collapse. Responding to Heaven is impartial; claiming sagacity for oneself is private. How could the spirit tolerate the private? Heaven’s Dao aids the good—victory’s fruit lies herein.

*Yanzhai’s Oral Teachings*: Heaven and Earth give life to all things without distinction of high or low, noble or base. To nourish the form with external things while the heart remains unfulfilled is to deny the spirit’s self-possession. Harmony means unity with things. Treachery is self-interest. Our spirit is originally one with the myriad things; when emotions and desires obscure it with self-interest, this is what it abhors—then illness arises. If the ruler suffers this unawares, I must admonish him.

Intentional love for the people harms them; intentional disarmament provokes conflict. The completion of good and evil follows set paths—hence the term "vessel." To act with a mind of contrivance in pursuit of tangible achievements is to "create form." Once formed, it becomes fixed. A mind clinging to fixation without transformation invites contention, resentment, and desire, injuring the inner self. To be disturbed and disordered by external things is "external warfare."

Crane formations are names of military arrays; watchtowers are names of official towers; drill grounds are places of sacrifice. If the human heart were in harmony with things, even within a single chamber, one would see no ranks of infantry and cavalry arrayed before them—how could it become a realm of strife? Human nature deems gain as compliance and loss as opposition; without gain, there is no loss—hence "concealing rebellion within attainment." This phrase is well placed below.

Cunning refers to the sprouting of scheming within. Knowledge and strategy arise from this cunning; warfare, in turn, arises from knowledge and strategy. Seeking victory to gratify one’s private senses is like winning—yet within the breast, things contend and disturb. Though victorious, the spirit is wearied—hence "where lies the goodness in such victory?"

"Refrain from contention" means: simply cultivate one’s original sincerity to align with the natural reality of Heaven and Earth, meeting things without conflict. Without striving, one achieves true victory, and the people’s deaths are already averted—why seek disarmament? Wu Gui met Marquis Wu again not to scheme for personal advancement but to correct his errors and deliver the people from calamity.

Marquis Wu, however, spoke of tiring of scallions and leeks while craving wine and meat—how greatly he exalted himself and belittled others! Wu Gui, unbowed by power, directly said, "You exhaust your spirit and form," not merely scorning him but pitying him. Yet Marquis Wu remained oblivious, so steeped in daily sensual pleasures that he neglected the care of his form and spirit—thus his bewilderment at the admonition.

Wu Gui then expounded on Heaven and Earth’s nurturing as one, to humble his self-exalting heart. The key lay in the phrase: "The spirit loves harmony and abhors treachery." The spirit is one’s true self. Yet Marquis Wu’s inquiry about righteousness and disarmament arose from losing righteousness and then seeking it, from exhausting warfare and then desiring disarmament—suddenly reversing his nature. Was this genuine?

Grace and harm arise from the same principle. Only by entrusting oneself to authenticity can one be preserved. All things completed and deemed beautiful are vessels of harm. This refers to tangible achievements. Loving the people and laying down arms are the most conspicuous of these paths. When I act with this heart, others respond in kind—this is "creating form." Once formed, it inevitably invites attack. Movement brings encounters with things—this is "external warfare." How much more so when arraying troops, parading cavalry, and flaunting might to the world, coveting the world’s submission? Gains achieved contrary to principle all conceal rebellion. Heaven aids the compliant—how can the rebellious endure?

Victory through cunning fills the world with schemes; victory through strategy expands calculations and deepens harm to things. Victory through war kills people, annexes lands, and burns cities and states—no harm is greater! All stem from accumulated violence, yet the vast net of Heaven cannot be escaped, and one perishes with it. Thus, one must be vigilant from the slightest beginnings.

Now, wielding the power of rulership, you indulge boundless desires to nourish your private self. Compared to nurturing your spirit, which is the better path? Where lies the goodness in such victory? Let Marquis Wu reflect on this himself. If you have not yet understood the Way of nurturing the spirit, simply cultivate your inherent sincerity to align with Heaven and Earth without contention. This is following Heaven and Earth’s nurturing, recognizing their unity with yourself. Then ruler and people will rejoice in harmony, the utmost accord flowing silently. Things will be free of blight, and people free of premature death—why then cling to the petty pursuit of disarmament?

The Daoist master of Wulin, Chu Boxiu, on *Xu Wugui* (Chapter Two)

When the Yellow Emperor was to visit Grand Chen at Mount Juci, Fangming drove his chariot, Changyu rode as his attendant, Zhangruo and Weipeng led the horses, while Kunhun and Guji followed in the rear carriage. Arriving at the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all lost their way and had nowhere to ask for directions. They happened upon a young boy herding horses and inquired of him, saying: "Do you know Mount Juci?" The boy replied: "I do." "Do you know where Grand Chen resides?" "I do." The Yellow Emperor said: "How extraordinary, this young boy! Not only does he know Mount Juci, but he also knows where Grand Chen dwells. Pray, may I ask how to govern the world?" The boy said: "Governing the world is no different from this—what more is there to be done? From my youth, I roamed freely within the Six Directions. Then I fell ill with dizziness, and an elder taught me, saying: 'Ride the sun’s chariot and wander the wilds of Xiangcheng.' Now that my illness has slightly improved, I am about to roam beyond the Six Directions once more. Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to be done?"

The Yellow Emperor said: "Governing the world is truly not your concern. Nevertheless, I beg to ask how to govern the world." The boy declined to answer. The Yellow Emperor pressed him again. The boy said: "What difference is there between governing the world and herding horses? Simply remove what harms the horses—that is all."

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and called him "Heavenly Master" before withdrawing.

*(Annotations from commentators preserved in parallel structure:)*
Guo’s note: "Sage" is but a name; names arise and things become confused. Even if one seeks Grand Hiddenness, how can it be attained? Let each follow its own nature, and there will be no affairs—only then can one govern the world. "Riding the sun’s chariot" means to go forth with activity and return with rest. In governing the world, nothing surpasses letting things follow their own course—why should one interfere? Thus, I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves. Affairs arise from the people’s actions, and now the people attain self-mastery. There must be a Dao to this. Horses are harmed by excess—follow Heaven, and by removing excess, Grand Hiddenness will arrive.

Lü’s note: "Hiddenness" means loftiness. Nothing is greater or higher than the Dao. Covering and sheltering the myriad things—this is the meaning of Mount Juci. Desiring to see Grand Hiddenness, the Seven Sages went together, yet all became lost in the wilds of Xiangcheng, finding no path to ask the way. It is like the Seven Apertures being drilled into Chaos, causing its death. Those who seek the great Dao while clinging to sagely knowledge will surely reach the heights only to become lost and never awaken. The horse’s celestial position is noon, the southern fire of the heart. The boy is one without knowledge, yet in herding horses, he should know Mount Juci and where Grand Hiddenness resides. The human heart contains spirit, and spirit has no fixed direction. To wander without leaving the Six Directions—this is not due to dizziness. To cure it, nothing surpasses ascending with clarity, riding the sun’s chariot to wander Xiangcheng. Though the illness has slightly improved, he still rides the sun’s chariot. If he ceased riding it to wander beyond the Six Directions, would he still have rest? Governing the world is like nurturing the heart—what else is there to do but remove what harms it? Following the heart’s inclinations as one’s teacher—who lacks a teacher? Once one knows it lies within, this is why he was called "Heavenly Master" and withdrew.

Yi Du’s note: Grand Hiddenness is a bold name for the Dao. Mount Juci is a metaphor for thorny, hard-to-reach places. Fang Ming and Zhi Jie are all fabricated names, each grasping a partial aspect—the scattering of the Dao. Xiangcheng County belongs to Ruzhou, south of Mount Juci. "Herding horses" means to follow the nature of things and guide them. The boy is one without knowledge or attachments. This is a parable about the Yellow Emperor’s six ministers, who relied on seeking the Dao to reach its abode. Xiangcheng is a metaphor for the Middle Way; the "wilds" mean no fixed destination. The horse-herding boy could point out the Seven Sages’ delusion, so the Yellow Emperor marveled at him. The mountain is not yet separate from its place; its existence is not apart from its being—this is the coarse aspect of the Dao, which can be taught and learned. As for the Dao’s subtlety, only by cutting off learning and forgetting words can it be attained. The sage’s governance of the world arises from non-affairs, and action arises from non-action—what more is there to do? "Roaming within the Six Directions" refers to past involvement in worldly affairs. Engaging with the world cannot be without rest, hence the dizziness of head and eyes. "Riding the sun’s chariot" means following the sun’s renewal and transformation. The wilds of Xiangcheng are near Mount Juci and far from the dust, so the illness slightly improved. "Again roaming beyond the Six Directions" expresses the intent to transcend the realm of things.

Zhuangzi likely means that those who study the Dao must first reach the Dao’s abode, hence "where Grand Hiddenness resides." Yet one cannot avoid emerging to engage with the world and partake in its rest, hence "roaming within the Six Directions and suffering dizziness." "Again roaming beyond the Six Directions" means entering the Heavenly Dao and practicing non-action—what more is there to do? The Yellow Emperor pressed him repeatedly, so the boy told him of herding horses: removing what harms the horses is the sage’s use of punishment to pacify the world.

Bi Xu’s note: The Yellow Emperor achieved merit but did not cling to it, so he sought the Dao in seclusion and encountered the horse-herding boy. The boy’s analogy of herding horses to governing the state is profound! The horse’s true nature is to graze on grass and drink water, self-sufficient; the people’s true nature is to plow for food and weave for clothing, self-sufficient—nothing more is needed. "Riding the sun’s chariot" means following the Dao of daily renewal, adapting to change without stagnation. The second question went unanswered, demonstrating the teaching of wordless instruction. Today’s horse-herders do not know that whipping harms them; those who nurture the people are blind to how laws and decrees breed deceit. They claim horses are hard to tame and people hard to govern—both are mistaken.

Liu Li’s note: The wonder of non-thought and non-action is uniquely sensed by the utmost spirit. In responding to the world, one cannot but share in the people’s troubles. Thus, it is said: "From my youth, I roamed freely within the Six Directions. Then I fell ill with dizziness." The way to share in the people’s rest is no other than following the bright laws of yin and yang, going forth with activity and returning with rest, without violating principle. Thus, it is said: "Ride the sun’s chariot and wander the wilds of Xiangcheng." In this way, the people’s troubles are removed—this is the time to achieve merit and withdraw. Returning to the Dao, one is not burdened by things, hence "now that my illness has slightly improved, I am about to roam beyond the Six Directions once more." For those who have not yet attained the highest in governing the world, nothing surpasses removing what harms their nature—this is the foundation of nurturing nature. Removing what harms the horses is the essence of herding horses. This is the coarse aspect that can be transmitted in words, so the boy could not decline to answer.

Wu Chou’s note: Mount Juci means fullness and concealment, a metaphor for the Dao’s wholeness. Dwelling on this mountain, one is great and unmatched, lofty and unsurpassed—hence "Grand Hiddenness." Xiangcheng is a land without people, a metaphor for the Dao’s path.

Viewed through the traces of the Yellow Emperor, he still seemed not yet profoundly merged with the Dao, yet his desire to meet the Seven Sages was precisely how the fullness of the Dao is revealed. Arriving at Xiangcheng and finding no one to ask the way—this is because the Dao’s wholeness originally resides within oneself. Why then seek Mount Juci in the distance, or suppose that the Grand Hiddenness could be seen by the Seven Sages? Only the horse-herding boy could know it. Herding horses by removing what harms them is a metaphor for preserving the true nature of life without artificially prolonging it—this is Mount Juci, the abode of the Grand Hiddenness.

*Yanzhai Oral Exegesis*: The names of the Six Ministers are all allegories. "Chariot of the Sun" means journeying together with the sun, as in "daily renewal." Within the Six Directions, one has not yet departed from things, hence the affliction of dimmed vision. To depart from this affliction and roam in spontaneity is to be beyond the Six Directions. Governing the world is likewise: one must not be burdened by things within the realm of existence. The horse-herder who follows their nature without harming it has fully realized the Way of herding. The "Celestial Master" is so called because he embodies the harmony of heaven and humanity and can serve as one’s teacher. The Yellow Emperor’s meeting with the Grand Hiddenness on Mount Juci is like Yao’s encounter with the Four Masters on Mount Gushe—it is a communion of spirit and qi, not something to be sought through form. The Yellow Emperor’s reliance on the Six Ministers signifies that as long as the six senses remain unextinguished, one still takes knowledge and perception as the means to sagehood. Though he sought the Grand Hiddenness, he inevitably became lost midway. The Grand Hiddenness, undifferentiated and complete, symbolizes the essence of the Dao. Mount Juci, fully concealing, symbolizes the Dao’s function. The wilds of Xiangcheng still retain the vestiges of the mundane world, unlike the boundless vastness of Dongting, for one has not yet attained emptiness, openness, and unbounded expansiveness. Not only do those who rely on such a place to seek the Dao find themselves at a loss, but even a ruler of singular clarity may become bewildered and directionless. Yet he still knew to ask the way of the horse-herding boy—this was at least somewhat commendable. The horse-herding boy is a metaphor for the spirit that guards the heart, akin to the Chan parable of herding the ox. But what is being herded? And who is the herder? Wisdom that can return the six senses to their source is no different from the skillful herder who removes what harms the horses. Governing the world is the same: its fundamental difficulty is no greater than this, just as governing the people is like herding sheep.

"Dimmed vision" refers to green-tinged eyes. The range of one’s sight does not extend beyond the Six Directions, confined by form and vessels and unable to illuminate all without exception—this is the affliction. The teaching that removes this affliction means being able to ride the light of heaven and ascend, so that roaming the wilds of Xiangcheng holds no confusion. Now that the illness has slightly improved and one roams beyond the Six Directions, one is no longer bound by form and vessels yet still recognizes the distinction between within and beyond the Six Directions—hence it is said to be only slightly improved. The boy merely took spontaneity as his teacher and could do this, so the Yellow Emperor called him "Celestial Master" and withdrew. This chapter uses allegory to illustrate the difficulty of learning the Dao, for many draw boundaries midway. One must consult the lord of the heart and take it as the guiding force, riding the light of heaven to ascend and roaming freely beyond form and vessels. Then Mount Juci can be reached without asking the way.

The scholar who delights in no change of thought is not content; the rhetorician who lacks the order of discourse is not content; the scrutinizer who has no censure to administer is not content—all are confined by things. The world-summoning scholar rises in court; the middling scholar delights in office; the sinewy scholar prides himself on overcoming difficulties; the brave scholar thrives in peril; the martial scholar rejoices in war; the withered scholar clings to reputation; the legalist scholar expands governance; the ritualist scholar reveres demeanor; the benevolent scholar values relationships. The farmer who has no weeding to do is not diligent; the merchant who has no marketplace is not diligent. The commoner who has morning and evening tasks is encouraged; the artisan who has mastery of tools is emboldened. The avaricious worry when wealth does not accumulate; the vainglorious grieve when power does not stand out. Those who delight in the fluctuations of circumstances, when they encounter the right moment, cannot remain inactive. All these follow the turning of the seasons and do not transcend change. They exhaust their physical and spiritual nature, channeling it into the myriad things, never returning throughout their lives—how lamentable!

Guo’s commentary: Unable to find fulfillment within and delighting in things without, they are thus confined. Each is confined by what they delight in, so that the myriad things come unbidden, not by force. The differences among scholars are such that those who encounter them must not lightly change their methods. When their dispositions align, their affairs align, hence their mutual affinity. When their endeavors achieve their aims, they are encouraged. When their tasks lack skill, they grow indolent. When things accord with their desires, they delight. Power and influence arise from changing circumstances. All these scholars have their moments of use, and when the moment comes, they cannot restrain themselves. If they do not encounter the right moment, even if they wish to act on their own, how can they? Thus, nobility and baseness have no constant ability, each has its limit, like the four seasons which cannot be altered. When things accord with their time and follow their proper order, each has its use. Therefore, following the seasons brings order to the times; altering one’s nature means not being confined by things. To be confined by things yet not be confined—what else but destruction could result? Not adhering to the abilities of a single school but pursuing the myriad directions to seize the advantages of the moment—hence there are those who crawl back in defeat, which is why it is lamentable.

Lü’s commentary: There is no one who does not have a place of supreme joy; to attain it and roam there is to be greatly confined. Yet these scholars only delight in the biases of their own natures, thus they are confined by things and cannot confine things. From the world-summoning scholar to those who delight in the fluctuations of circumstances, though their inclinations differ, when they encounter the right moment and are put to use, they cannot remain inactive—this is uniformly due to not knowing where the true lord resides. Acting when the moment calls for it is not the nature of life. The moment has past and present, just as the year has cold and heat. Now, having encountered one moment, they cling to it and do not let go, unable to remain inactive—all these follow the turning of the seasons, knowing cold but not heat, heat but not cold, taking what they encounter as constant and not transcending change.

No one lacks a true lord within, yet they exhaust their physical nature, chasing after things without knowing how to return—this is what the perfected ones lament. Those who know delight in deploying their talents; disputatious scholars love to gallop their words; meticulous scholars strive to exhaust others’ explanations—all three are enslaved by things, hence called "confined."

The Dao can summon the world’s people to admiration; affairs can align with the common folk to bring them joy. Strength of sinew, military might, and courage all speak of their ability to defend the state against peril. Reclusion, seclusion, mountains and forests, legalists enforcing laws and debating punishments, ritual teachings that transform the people, benevolence and righteousness that benefit things—farmers take clearing wastelands as their vocation, merchants take marketplaces as their vocation. The common folk have no leisure day; from dawn to dusk, all have their work. The hundred craftsmen, with their mastery of tools and machines, see their skills grow robust with age.

The avaricious strive to amass much; without accumulation, they grieve. The vainglorious strive for power and influence; without preeminence, they sorrow. Those who delight in circumstances love action. Action takes change as its master, and taking change as joy, the moments they encounter differ—thus they cannot remain inactive. All these myriad affairs are bound by things, each obscured by one corner, none attuned to the great thoroughfare.

The year governs the four seasons; the *Yi* governs the myriad things. The sage is one with Heaven, thus able to govern the year without being governed by the year, to govern things through the *Yi* without being governed by the *Yi*. Those of partial understanding invert this: governed by the year, they are like the disparate qi of the four seasons; governed by the *Yi*, they are like the diverse forms of the myriad things.

*Bi Xu* notes: Dismissing calculations and concerns leaves the knowing scholar at an impasse; abandoning alliances and coalitions leaves the disputatious scholar in distress; exalting simplicity leaves the meticulous scholar idle. Those who cultivate inner nurturance and take no joy in external pursuits cannot be enslaved by things.

Scholars who summon the world esteem worthies to invigorate the court. Scholars who align with the common folk follow principle to glorify their offices. When times call for quelling peril, the brave boast and brag. When fine weapons and armor appear, they distance themselves from plows and hoes. Recluses do not serve kings and lords, dwelling in fame alone. When laws and decrees flourish, the indolent are spurred to action. When rites and ceremonies abound, pretense and affectation arise. Those who cultivate benevolence and righteousness take social connections as fulfillment.

If scholars do not study, farmers do not accumulate, craftsmen lack skill, merchants lack goods, and the common folk lose their livelihoods, it is due to their own indolence. The avaricious value wealth over their own bodies; the vainglorious prize power above their own lives. Taking joy in wielding power to manipulate things and delighting in change and movement, they are like the ears, eyes, and nose—each has its moment of use, yet none can restrain itself.

When talents and knowledge each fulfill their roles, undertakings succeed; when the four seasons lose their order, the year’s work is undone. Those who do not harmonize with the year are all led astray by things—their hearts transform, their forms follow, and this is called "not returning." Truly, it is lamentable.

*Yanzhai Oral Teachings*: Thoughts shift a hundred times; speeches proceed with order; in probing inquiries, they vie over fractions and hairs. Each of the three takes joy in their own abilities; a single day without them brings no pleasure—all are confined by things.

Those who summon the world dazzle with fame, desiring to rise and establish themselves in the court. The common folk are ordinary people, thus they take rank and salary as glory. Those of sinew and strength take pride in aiding in peril. The brave rejoice when calamity arises. Recluses and hermits fix their minds on reputation. The legalist school seeks to govern affairs. Those who respect appearances maintain dignified bearing. The socially ambitious value connections. "Clearing wastelands" refers to farming; "marketplaces" to commerce. "Harmony" means joy. "Dawn-to-dusk work" means daily accumulation of profit. Artisans take pride in their skills as they mature. "Power" means having something to rely on; "things" means having something amassed. Petty men cling to the powerful and influential, often following their lead, seeking fulfillment through action. When the moment calls for use, they cannot remain inactive.

When, within a single year, the hundred things grow and mature, all follow their proper sequence. What changes and transforms is not freely chosen by things. "Not governed by the *Yi*" means things do not change of their own accord. To exhaust body and mind, drowning in things without returning—how lamentable it is!

This chapter begins abruptly; it is suspected that preceding text is missing and cannot be recovered. It critiques the joys of the knowing, disputatious, and meticulous scholars, which are precisely what Dao cultivators lament—how diametrically opposed they are! Each is confined by their own abilities and cannot attain freedom.

"Summoning the world" means commending the worthy and honoring the excellent to attract the world’s scholars, thus invigorating the court. "Aligning with the common folk" means guiding the people, hence they are honored with offices and ranks. The subsequent discussion of scholars, farmers, commoners, and the hundred craftsmen—though their inclinations differ, each clings to one bias, taking fulfillment in usefulness while forgetting their toil and suffering, unaware of the peril of losing their nature. Yet they cannot adapt; each use has its limit, and when limits are reached, deceit and harm arise.

When in a position of disuse, they constantly yearn for usefulness, scheming over how to implement and arrange things—vain thoughts never cease for a moment. When the moment calls for use, their ambitions swell with satisfaction, and they have no leisure for inaction as they enact laws and flaunt their abilities. How can they be expected to remain inactive?

The avaricious grieve without accumulation; the vainglorious sorrow without preeminence—this does not depart from the earlier meaning. All these rest in what they should not rest in. It is like the governance of spring, autumn, winter, and summer over warmth, chill, cold, and heat—though they harmonize with the year, each attains its bias and cannot interchange with things. Cold commands cannot be applied in summer; heat commands cannot be applied in winter. "Not governed by the *Yi*" means not being altered by things. The text weaves its phrases intricately. Only the perfected one’s heart is one with the great void, and their body embodies the qi of the four seasons—thus they can transform things without being transformed by things.

**Xu Wugui, Third Chapter**

Zhuangzi said: "If an archer hits the mark without aiming beforehand, is this called good archery? If so, then all under heaven could be Yi—would that be acceptable?"
Huizi said: "It would."

Zhuangzi said: "If there is no shared rightness under heaven, and each affirms only what they themselves affirm, then all under heaven could be Yao—would that be acceptable?"
Huizi said: "It would."

Zhuangzi said: "In that case, the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists—together with you, that makes five. Which of them is truly right? Or is it someone like Lu Ju? His disciple said, *'I have grasped the Master’s Way! I can boil a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer!'* Lu Ju replied: *'This is merely summoning yang with yang and yin with yin—it is not what I call the Way. Let me show you my Way.'* Thereupon, he tuned two zithers, placing one in the hall and one in the chamber. When he plucked the *gong* note, the *gong* string resonated; when he plucked the *jiao* note, the *jiao* string resonated—their tones and measures were in harmony. But if he altered the tuning of one string so that it no longer corresponded to the five notes, and then plucked it, all twenty-five strings would vibrate. Though no different in sound, the ruler of tones had already emerged. Is this what you mean?"

Huizi said: "Now, the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists all contend with me in debate, refuting one another with words and overpowering one another with voices. Yet none has ever proven me wrong—what do you make of this?"

Zhuangzi said: "A man of Qi who sent his son to Song had a fate that was not whole; when he sought a fine bell, he bound it with ropes; when he sought a Tang servant, he never left his domain—such are those who leave things behind! The man of Chu who lodged his arrow in a target at night, in a time when no one was present, and thus won the favor of the boatman’s state—though he never left the cliff, he was sufficient to incur resentment. Guo’s commentary: *'Hitting the mark by accident is not good archery.'* If one takes hitting by mistake as good archery, then all under heaven could be called Yi—would that be acceptable? Clearly not. If those who hit by mistake are all Yi, then those who privately affirm themselves could also be called Yao. If all are Yao, then why do the five schools still refute one another? It is like Lu Ju and his disciple, both summoning yang with yang, yet arrogantly claiming to be right. Or when one alters the tuning of a single string and the five notes change with it: without sound, there is nothing to set them in motion; with sound, only the same resonates with the same. Now, if altering one string causes all twenty-five to change, it is merely adjusting tension and slack—Lu Ju boasted of this to his disciple, yet it is only mutual resonance, not a unique skill. The five schools each cling to their own views and affirm what they affirm, no different from the others, yet none can surpass the rest. *'None has ever proven me wrong'*—they each affirm themselves."

Hui Shi wished to take this as the ultimate truth. Zhuangzi then cited the case of a man from Qi who sent his son to a foreign land, instructing the gatekeeper to guard him, yet upon departure, he could not ensure his son’s safety. This man of Qi was unkind, yet he too considered himself right in doing so. Conversely, he would bind and protect a precious bell, fearing it might break or be damaged. He lost his son and could not search far, abandoning his own kind, yet he never once deemed himself wrong. Zhuangzi further recounted the tale of a man from Chu who lodged with a gatekeeper, both dwelling as guests yet unable to ascend high ground on their own. In the dead of night, the man boarded another’s boat, and before leaving the shore, he had already joined the boatman’s domain. The conduct of these two men—from Qi and Chu—was thus, yet they never considered themselves in error. How then do the five scholars differ from them in their self-affirmation?

Lu’s commentary: If all under heaven were archers like Yi, it would surely be untenable. Hui Shi, recognizing Zhuangzi’s words as directed at him, deemed them acceptable. To hit the mark is to be like Yi; to fail to meet prior expectations is to be like Yao—yet Yao need not be universally affirmed. This is what is meant by taking opposition as truth and victory as renown. Nevertheless, if the five scholars are not all correct, then the claim that all are Yao collapses. Otherwise, it is no different from Lu Ju tuning his zither, merely summoning resonance through sound. Shi claimed superiority over the other four, yet in truth, he differed not at all. Shi believed himself no different from the four, yet he still engaged in debate. *"None has ever proven me wrong"*—what then? These words sought to uphold the claim that all are Yao. Zhuangzi moved him with subtle speech.

The bond between father and child is a natural principle, yet the man of Qi abandoned his son in Song, entrusting him to a gatekeeper without concern for his safety—this illustrates Shi’s disregard for the essence of life while failing to cherish it. His pursuit of bells and cauldrons, binding them for fear of damage, and his search for a lost child only within his own domain, are like Shi’s attachment to external things—debate, reputation, and fame—treasuring them and fearing their harm, yet losing what is bestowed by heaven and failing to seek it as something precious. The man of Chu who lodged with the gatekeeper is like Shi, who lost the true dwelling of his nature and, amid the obscurity of right and wrong, contended with others for victory, achieving nothing but discord with the world—this is not what is called wisdom.

Yi Du’s commentary: If hitting the mark by chance is deemed good archery, then all under heaven are Yi. If private affirmation is taken as public truth, then all under heaven are Yao. Zhuangzi deemed this unacceptable, while Hui Shi found it acceptable. Zhuangzi asked: If this were true, then among the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, Gongsun Long, and yourself, who is correct? Lu Ju’s disciple could, in winter, gather a thousand-year-old ash around wood and produce fire in an instant to heat a cauldron; in summer, he could store water in a clay jar, boil it in hot water, place it in a well, and turn it to ice—claiming this as mastery of Lu Ju’s Way. Lu Ju said this was merely resonance through similarity, not what he called the Way. Thus, he tuned a zither, placing one in the hall and another in the chamber, so that the *gong* and *jue* notes resonated. When he altered a single string in the hall, all five notes in the chamber lost their harmony. The strings moved, yet when plucked, they no longer responded to the old tones. This shows that sound summons sound, with no difference, and only the ruler of sound can command it. Lu Ju boasted of this to his disciple, yet it was merely mutual resonance, not a unique skill. The five scholars each clung to their own views, no different from Lu Ju’s boasting to his disciple, yet none could surpass the others. Hui Shi said that the other four were now debating with him, *"None has ever proven me wrong,"* and thus wished to take this as truth. Zhuangzi then recounted the man of Qi who abandoned his son in Song, instructing the gatekeeper to guard him, yet could not ensure his safety—this man’s lack of kindness was also self-affirmed. He bound bells for fear of damage yet did not search beyond his domain for his lost child, valuing external things over his own kind and never deeming himself wrong. Hui Shi’s self-affirmation was no different. Long ago, a man of Chu lodged with a gatekeeper (a criminal assigned to guard the gate). In the dead of night, he boarded another’s boat, and before leaving the shore, he had already joined the boatman’s domain, forgetting his debt of gratitude and incurring resentment—his conduct was thus, yet he did not consider himself in error, no different from Hui Shi and his followers.

Bixu’s commentary: An archer who hits the mark by mistake is not skilled. One who affirms himself is not impartial.

The Five Masters took their mutual victories as divergent Ways, while Lu Ju measured superiority and inferiority to distinguish their arts, unaware that a greater unity underlay their differences. When the zither in the hall is tuned, its pitches align; yet when the *guan* and *jue* strings are altered, their sounds diverge. Thus, stillness is the master of the five notes, and silence the origin of all distinctions. Yet Hui Shi regarded his own eloquence as supreme, so Zhuangzi cited the man of Qi who slighted his son to pursue a lost heirloom, prizing external goods while betraying the Way in his quest for victory—never recognizing his own error. To lodge with a gatekeeper and then trample his trust is to dwell in lowly traces; to act in the dead of night is to contend in darkness; to remain bound to the shore is to be fettered by limits; and to provoke resentment is to invite blame.

*The Yan Zhai Oral Exegesis* states: The first phrase refers to the target. If one abandons the target and shoots at random, then all who hit the mark become archers like Yi—implying that without a fixed standard of rightness, each man clings to his own view, and all become sages like Yao. Since the Five Masters’ teachings differ, which one is truly correct? In winter, one cannot cook a cauldron without fire; in summer, one cannot make ice with water—such things are indeed difficult. Yet at the winter solstice, yang begins to grow; at the summer solstice, yin begins to grow. Summon yang with yang, and winter loses its cold; summon yin with yin, and summer loses its heat. Though this defies the seasons, there is a principle by which it may be done. This is not what I call the Way—it merely shows their arts are not yet refined. Let each place a zither in the hall: strike one, and the other resonates; *guan* answers *guan*, *jue* answers *jue*—this is easily explained by their shared sound. But if only one string is tuned, and no single note is fixed among the five, then striking *guan* or *zhi* will suffice. Hence it is called "without a standard." Strike one string here, and all twenty-five strings there vibrate—this is far more difficult than *guan* answering *guan* or *jue* answering *jue*. Reasoning thus, the five notes all take sound as their ruler, for none departs from the voice of the strings. Thus, they are not fundamentally different from sound. How is this unlike summoning yin with yin or yang with yang? Lu Ju, claiming superiority, merely affirmed his own rightness—none grasped the true standard.

*Fu* means to resist; *zhen*, to submit. *Zhi* (蹢) is pronounced like *zhi* (掷), meaning to halt. The man of Qi, unable to employ his son in a worthy role, set him to guard the gate, yet still deemed himself correct. When he sought a small bell, he took pains to protect it, loving the object but not his child—another instance of self-affirmation, like searching for a lost son only within his own village. This is delusion. The man of Chu, lame in one foot, served as a gatekeeper—this is a separate statement, unrelated to the earlier *zhi*. "A remnant kind" suggests a rough resemblance. These three cases loosely parallel the Five Masters, much as the earlier analogy did. The transition here, before concluding the theme of resentment, is a masterful stroke in composition. The core of this chapter is to mock Hui Shi’s self-righteousness. Since Hui Shi loved debate, Zhuangzi crafted these cryptic words to confound him, much like Dongfang Shuo’s exchanges with his attendants. The argument that "all are Yi, all are Yao" was Zhuangzi’s way of restraining Hui Shi’s flaw, seeking to cure his self-affirmation. Thus, he cited Lu Ju’s contest with his disciples over superiority and inferiority. "Summon yang with yang, yin with yin" is simply like responding to like with like. But when one string is retuned here, and all the other strings there change, they no longer resonate because their sounds differ. The five notes are all sound, yet each has its governing tone—this is the ruler of sound. Only a keen listener can discern it. Thus, striking *guan* makes *guan* vibrate, striking *jue* makes *jue* vibrate—this is mere correspondence by kind, nothing extraordinary. The Five Masters each affirmed their own partial view, lacking impartiality, just as *guan* is confined to *guan* and *jue* to *jue*, unable to communicate. Hui Shi still failed to grasp this, believing his ability to surpass the other four proved he had never been wrong—thus, his rightness was true. Zhuangzi then cited the man of Qi who valued bells over his son, betraying principle yet clinging to self-righteousness, and the man of Chu who lodged with a gatekeeper and fought him, unaware of his own error—this was the third turn of the argument. Here we see Zhuangzi’s deep affection for Hui Shi, as later passages will reveal.

Sound is like wood; tone is like the beams, rafters, and purlins of a house. The ruler of tone is like the master craftsman’s hand, which shapes the beams and rafters—none can do without it. When Zhuangzi passed Hui Shi’s grave while attending a funeral, he turned to his followers and said: A man of Ying smeared his nose with a speck of white clay no thicker than a fly’s wing and had Carpenter Shi shave it off. Carpenter Shi swung his axe with such force that it whistled like the wind, yet he sliced away the clay without harming the man’s nose, who stood unflinching. When the Lord of Song heard of this, he summoned Carpenter Shi and said: "Try it for me." The carpenter replied: "Your servant once could do this, but my material has been dead for a long time." Since the Master’s death, I have had no material to work with, no one to speak with.

Guo Xiang’s commentary: Without the unmoving material, the partner who forgets words, even the most skillful carving would be useless.
Lü Huiqing’s commentary: Only because of this did Zhuangzi repeatedly engage him and deeply regret his failure to reach enlightenment.
Yi Du’s commentary: There were Hui Shi’s questions, and then Zhuangzi’s answers. With Hui Shi gone, Zhuangzi lamented the loss of one to converse with, hence his allusion to Carpenter Shi.

The man of Ying smeared his nose with white clay and had Carpenter Shi swing his axe to shave it off—this required the man of Ying’s unflinching stillness to achieve its wonder. When the Lord of Song wished to see it, Carpenter Shi said: "Your servant once could do this, but my material has been dead for a long time." The material refers to the man of Ying, who was already dead and could not be replicated.

Zhuangzi himself said that his loss of Hui Shi was like Carpenter Shi’s loss of the man of Ying, hence his lament: "I have no material to work upon, none with whom to speak"—this echoes Bo Ya’s breaking of his strings. Bi Xu’s commentary: There are those whose forms are withered wood, but few who stand before the blade without fear. There are those who wield the axe to display their skill, but rare are those who, facing the nose, swing freely. Thus we know that encounters of mutual perception and responses of wordless understanding are not common in this world!

*Yanqi’s Oral Exegesis*: "Swinging the axe to create a wind" speaks of its swiftness. To remove all the clay without harming the nose—this is difficult enough for the carver, but even more difficult for the one standing. The "material" is the ground for skill. Only with Hui Shi’s disputations could I exhaust my arguments. Now that Hui Shi is dead, there is none with whom I may speak!

Zhuangzi embraced the Dao with lofty firmness, beyond the reach of worldly custom to fathom its depth and vastness. Thus, the beginnings of discourse had no means to arise—only Hui Shi could engage with him in timely discussion, allowing him to expound his boundless, unbounded ideas and fully express the marvels within his breast. In this lay the conveyance of the Dao and the resonance of literature. After Hui Shi’s death, Zhuangzi passed by his grave and recalled him, turning to his followers to voice his grief. We may know then that Carpenter Shi’s axe was sharp indeed, yet without the man of Ying’s ability to stand firm, his craft would have had no place to apply. "Your servant’s material has been dead for a long time"—thus, though the axe swung without error, how rare was he who could forget his form and submit to the carving! Zhuangzi’s loss of Hui Shi was the same.

The phrase "I have no material to work upon" is difficult to explicate. Examining the text’s meaning closely: earlier it says, "Your servant’s material has been dead for a long time," and again, "one must have the material"—only a dead man who does not fear or flinch may be carved. Now that Hui Shi is gone, though this "material" remains, there is none to respond to it, as if there were no material at all. It means there is no kindred spirit in the world to spur mutual inspiration. "None with whom to speak"—this reveals the depth of his sorrow for his departed friend.

During Hui Shi’s lifetime, he often made critical remarks, and Master Nanhua (Zhuangzi) would exhaust his loyalty and effort to correct him. Though he could not escape the reputation for contentious eloquence, what they pursued were pure discussions and refined debates, avoiding the deceitful and cunning ways of their time—this was also the power of noble friendship. Thus, even after Hui Shi’s passing, Master Nanhua still gave him thought.

"Listening and carving it"—according to Guo Xiang’s commentary, it says "closing his eyes and letting his hands move freely." In Chen Bixu’s *Zhaojiangnan Li-shi Shuku* edition, these four characters are part of the main text, later mistakenly attributed to Guo’s commentary. These four characters do not resemble commentary, hence the correction.

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu, on *Xu Wugui*, Chapter Four

When Guan Zhong fell ill, Duke Huan asked him, "The illness of our Uncle has grown severe. If it should worsen to the point of crisis, to whom may I entrust the state?"

Guan Zhong replied, "Whom does Your Lordship wish to appoint?"

The Duke said, "Bao Shuya."

Guan Zhong said, "That will not do. Though he is a man of integrity and a fine scholar, he does not associate with those inferior to himself. Moreover, once he hears of another’s fault, he never forgets it. If he were to govern the state, above he would constrain his lord, and below he would alienate the people. It would not be long before he offended Your Lordship."

The Duke said, "Then who is suitable?"

Guan Zhong replied, "If there is no alternative, then Yin Peng will do. His character is such that above he forgets his rank, and below he does not rebel. He feels shame at not equaling the Yellow Emperor and pities those who do not equal himself. To share virtue with others is called sageliness; to share wealth with others is called worthiness. To govern others with worthiness brings no success; to humble oneself with worthiness brings success without fail. In the state, there are things he does not hear; in his household, there are things he does not see. If there is no alternative, then Yin Peng will do."

Guo’s commentary: "Above he forgets his rank, and below he does not rebel"—this means he is lofty yet not overbearing. He pities those who do not equal himself, thus he discards no one. If he were to hear and see everything, affairs would center upon him, leaving subordinates nowhere to turn. Though he does not entirely let go, he is merely adequate.

Lü’s commentary: "Tolerance becomes impartiality; impartiality becomes kingship; kingship becomes Heaven; Heaven becomes the Dao. These five are what he embodies. Thus, impartiality enables one to be impartial, and kingship enables one to be a king. The titles of king and duke derive from this. Can Yin Peng’s virtue be called tolerance that becomes impartiality?"

Yi Duzhu’s annotation: "Duke Huan’s hegemony was due to Guan Zhong’s efforts. When Guan Zhong’s illness grew critical, the Duke asked whom he might entrust with the state. Guan Zhong in turn asked whom the Duke wished to appoint. The Duke named Bao Shuya, Guan Zhong’s friend. Guan Zhong said it would not do, for though Bao Shuya’s integrity made him a fine scholar, he was not capable of great achievement. By not associating with those inferior to himself, he would lose the people’s hearts and lack support. By remembering others’ faults, he would incur widespread resentment. If he were to govern the state, above he would constrain his lord, and below he would alienate the people, so that he would soon offend the ruler. When the Duke asked who was suitable, Guan Zhong said that if there were no alternative, Yin Peng would do. ‘Above he forgets’ means he forgets his position; ‘below he does not rebel’ means he remains within bounds. Feeling shame at not equaling the Yellow Emperor, his Dao grows ever loftier. Pitying those who do not equal himself, his virtue grows ever broader. The Way of the ruler is to share virtue with others; the Way of the minister is to share wealth with others. In terms of transformation, this is called sageliness; in terms of conduct, this is called worthiness. To govern others with worthiness is to govern without proper method; to humble oneself with worthiness is to humble oneself so that others are drawn to him. ‘There are things he does not hear; there are things he does not see’—this means he can turn his hearing inward and reflect, so that there is nothing he does not hear and nothing he does not see."

Bixu’s commentary: "Bao Shuya could not endure hardship or tolerate impurity to bring salvation to the world. He sought to make all things equal to his own integrity, thus he would constrain his lord; by not associating with others, he would alienate the people. Yin Peng’s character was neither obsequious nor arrogant. He revered the Dao and pitied the people. The sage does not claim virtue for himself; the worthy does not hoard wealth. By humbling himself with worthiness, how could he fail to succeed? Thus, the great should humble themselves. ‘In the state, there are things he does not hear; in his household, there are things he does not see’—this means he forgets the world entirely. Was Bao Shuya’s recommendation of Guan Zhong impartial? And was Guan Zhong’s recommendation of Yin Peng anything but impartial?"

*Yanzhai Oral Teachings*: "'Does not associate' means he does not frequent them. 'Constrain' means to bind them. 'Alienate' means to force them with ritual and righteousness. 'Above he forgets' means he forgets his position. 'Below he does not rebel' means he keeps his distance and makes no demands of his superiors. 'To share virtue with others' is like saying 'virtue descends, and the common people cherish it.' 'To share wealth with others' means not being selfish. 'To govern others with worthiness' means to flaunt one’s reputation and be self-important. 'There are things he does not hear; there are things he does not see' means he is not overly scrutinizing. This passage does not appear in other texts but only in the *Liezi*, where it is also a parable.

"Bao Shuya was Guan Zhong’s worthy friend. When the Duke asked whom to entrust with the state, Guan Zhong should have recommended Bao Shuya, yet he first inquired whom the Duke wished to appoint. When the Duke named Bao Shuya, Guan Zhong, knowing his friend’s virtue but recognizing that his talent was insufficient to handle complex affairs, feared he would adhere rigidly to principle without flexibility, constrain the ruler, and alienate the people. Thus, he decisively declared him unsuitable. He did not recommend him out of personal favor, lest he be given a task beyond his capacity and offend the ruler. 'If there is no alternative, then Yin Peng will do' means he is merely adequate. 'Above he forgets and below he does not rebel'—in the *Liezi*, this reads 'below he does not rebel.' Zhang Zhan’s commentary states: 'Being above and forgetting himself, he does not worry about those below leaving him.' This suffices to prove that the *Zhuangzi* text is corrupt. The ancient character 畔 is interchangeable with 叛. Judging by this discussion of Yin Peng’s virtue, it seems inappropriate to speak of rebellion. If interpreted as 'boundary,' it does not make sense. The *Liezi* reading of 'below he does not rebel' is correct.

'In the state, there are things he does not hear; in his household, there are things he does not see'—this means his governance is lenient and forgiving. He does not flaunt his intelligence to impose harsh scrutiny. By humbling himself, he wins the people’s allegiance. Knowing he could be entrusted with the state, Guan Zhong preferred that he govern with understanding rather than enact laws that harm the people. Better to be magnanimous and win the people’s support, maintaining peace without incident. This was Guan Zhong’s ability to recognize and employ talent, which enabled him to achieve hegemony for Qi. Loyal to his lord and caring toward his friend, in terms of righteousness, this was truly a case of mutual benefit.

"'Can it not be said'—in the *Liezi*, this reads 'one need not avoid saying,' which is more appropriate.

King Wu of Wu was floating on the river and ascended Mount Ju. The troop of monkeys, seeing him, fled in alarm and hid in the dense thickets. One monkey, however, lingered, swinging and leaping, displaying its skill before the king."

The king loosed his arrow, swift and unbroken. The monkey, nimble and quick, seized and caught the shaft. The king commanded his attendants to hasten and shoot it, and the monkey was seized and died. Turning to his friend Yan Buyi, the king said: "This monkey, boasting of its skill and relying on its agility, dared to mock me—thus it met this end! Take heed! Alas! Never let your demeanor make you arrogant toward others!"

Yan Buyi returned home and studied under Dong Wu to uproot his prideful bearing. He abandoned pleasure and declined honors, and after three years, the people of the state praised him.

Guo’s commentary: *Min* means swift; *gei*, to nock an arrow. Though the arrow flew fast, the monkey could still seize it. The people of the state praised him for forgetting cunning and shedding pride, returning to unadorned simplicity.

Lü’s commentary: One who is arrogant in demeanor harbors arrogance in the heart, which manifests in countenance. To uproot pride is to discard such a heart—this is what is meant by the six aspects of bearing, movement, expression, principle, speech, and qi, all of which are distortions of the heart.

Yi’s annotation: The monkey, priding itself on its skill and relying on the convenience of the mountain forests to mock others, brought about its own death. Thus the king warned Buyi not to be arrogant in demeanor. Buyi accepted the lesson, returned home, and studied under a man of the Dao, uprooting his haughty pride to embrace simplicity. For this, the people of the state praised his virtue.

Bixu’s commentary: Those who cower and hide in seclusion avoid misfortune, while those who act recklessly and linger invite disaster. Thus the monkey, relying solely on its cunning, could not escape the many arrows. Even a creature of the mountains and forests, lacking understanding, dares to mock humans and meets swift death—how much more so for humans, the most intelligent of beings, who would dare to treat their own kind with arrogance and disdain? Buyi returned and uprooted his prideful bearing, and the people praised him. How easily he awakened!

*Yanzhai Oral Teachings*: *Min gei* describes the speed of the arrow’s flight, yet the monkey could still seize it with equal swiftness. The *xiangzhe* were the king’s attendants. When they all shot at once, the monkey, though nimble, could not match their strength and was seized and killed. This serves as a warning to those who boast of their abilities. Monkey and man are different species; the monkey, dwelling as king among the deep mountains and dense forests, feared even the sound of humans—how much more their presence? Yet when it saw the King of Wu, it displayed its skill, swinging and grooming itself—this was the omen of its swift death, and so it could not escape. Though it could seize the arrows in flight, it was truly swift and nimble. The king, marveling at its excessive cunning, ordered his attendants to hasten and shoot it, so that none of its shots missed their mark. How could it avoid being struck? Its death clinging to the tree was only fitting. From this, the king realized how swiftly arrogance brings disaster and how standing apart invites ruin in an instant. Thus he warned his friend never to be arrogant in demeanor. Buyi returned and uprooted his pride, abandoning honors—was this not courage in embracing goodness? Yet it took three years before the people praised him, for virtue lies in unflagging perseverance, and success comes only after a thousand days. But for evil, a single morning is enough to bring ruin—how could one not take heed?

Nanbo Zijing leaned on his armrest and sat, gazing upward and sighing. Yan Chengzi entered and said: "Master, you are the most extraordinary of beings. Can your form truly be made like withered bones, your heart like dead ashes?"

He replied: "Once I dwelled in a mountain cave. At that time, when the lord of the fields and crops caught sight of me, the people of the state of Qi thrice congratulated him. I must have been the first to know—thus he knew; I must have offered it—thus he prepared."

If I did not possess it, how could they have known? If I did not offer it, how could they have prepared? Alas! I grieve for those who lose themselves, and I grieve again for those who grieve for others, and I grieve yet again for those who grieve over the grief of others—thus does the distance grow with each passing day.

Guo’s commentary: The state of Qi thrice offered congratulations because they took honor in having seen Zicha. Zitai knew that his actions were insufficient to save others and only enough to lose himself, so he grieved without grieving—thus his grief gradually faded. His heart became still, his form withered—this is how the distance grew with each passing day.

Lü’s commentary: When the lord of the fields and crops caught sight of him, the people of Qi thrice congratulated him. He had already offered himself first, so they knew; he had already displayed himself, so they prepared. His heart was not yet fully inward but had already advanced outward—this is how he became known to others. The Way of Heaven has never yet possessed anything. If there remains even the slightest knowing intent within the heart, this is self-loss—loss meaning the forfeiture of one’s original heart. Zicha grieved for those who lost themselves in this way, wishing for their return. Yet to know their loss and grieve for it is still loss, not return. I grieve again for those who grieve for others—then both the grieving and the grieved remain ignorant of their own state. This is why the distance grows with each passing day, unburdened by things, so that his form does not wither, his heart does not turn to ashes—could it be otherwise?

Yi Du’s commentary: "The most extraordinary of beings" refers to one with surpassing talent who can forget his body and heart to this degree. Yet even Zicha considered this insufficient. Once I dwelled in the mountains, and when the lord of the state caught sight of me, the people thrice offered congratulations. How did I come to be thus regarded by others? Had I not first made my name known, how could they have known and prepared? There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart. People all lose their innate goodness, so I grieve for them. Yet my grief is itself grievous! To cast off burdens in this way is still not the ultimate. I grieve again for those who grieve for others—thus shedding burdens layer by layer, the entanglements of the world grow ever more distant.

Bixu’s commentary: When Liezi lived in the gardens of Zheng, he remained obscure; when he went to Qi, he received emoluments. Those who cling to fame are like the sun hidden behind clouds—its light flickers forth only intermittently. Thus he constantly "sold" his name. Virtue arises from the inquiries of men like Chao and Xu, so later generations of recluses who dwell in mountain caves borrow the loftiness of their seclusion as a shortcut to officialdom—true reclusion has vanished. To grieve for those who lose themselves is to lament their pursuit of fame. To grieve for those who grieve for others is to recognize that the fault lies within oneself. To grieve for those who grieve over the grief of others is to awaken to the error of intentionality. Only then does one’s understanding of principle and affairs grow more distant with each day, merging at last with the great harmony of the Qi River!

*Yanzhai’s Oral Teachings* states: First he spoke of "offering"—since I left traces visible to others, they could know me. This is why it is self-loss. To grieve for those who lose themselves without realizing one’s own grief is yet more grievous. In the mountain cave, my former dwelling, I spoke only of grieving for the grief of others—this is how the Way grew ever more distant, until today my form is withered, my heart like dead ashes. This is the same as the opening of *The Equality of Things and Opinions*, where Nan Guo Zicha is questioned by Yan Cheng upon his entry. "Leaning on the armrest" describes the moment of utmost stillness. "Gazing upward and sighing"—his mechanism had already stirred, so he seized the opportunity to question him. "The most extraordinary of beings" refers to the most spiritually refined. Yet now he is withered like this—Zitai recalled past events in response to the lord of the fields. When the lord of Qi heard of Zicha’s worthiness and visited him in the mountains, the state thrice offered congratulations, for his attainment of worthiness could bring order. If I possess it, they know; if I display it, they prepare—this means he could not conceal himself and thus attracted fame. With fame comes entanglement; with heavy responsibility comes peril—what is this if not self-loss? This is truly grievous. My grief for those who lose themselves is near and easily seen. My grief for those who grieve for others grows deeper, turning inward to self-grief. My grief for those who grieve over the grief of others surrenders to the inevitable, grieving without grieving and letting the heavenly pipes sound of themselves. Only then do the world’s cares grow ever more distant, allowing his form to wither and his heart to turn to ashes. Truly, to conceal one’s talent in reclusion has ever been difficult—only the dragon that slips free of the world’s net, the wild goose that soars beyond the clouds, can preserve this to the end.

**Chapter Five: Xu Wugui**

When Confucius journeyed to Chu, the King of Chu feasted him. Sun Shu’ao stood holding the goblet, while Shi Nanyilaio received the wine and made libation, saying: “Ah, the men of old!”—and with these words, he fell silent.

Confucius said: “I have heard of the speech that speaks not, yet have never spoken it. Here, now, I shall speak it.”

Shi Nanyilaio juggled his balls, and the feud between the two families dissolved. Sun Shu’ao slept sweetly, holding his feather fan, while the men of Ying laid down their weapons. Yet I, Qiu, would fain have a beak three feet long!

That is called the Way that is not the Way; this is called the eloquence that speaks not. Thus virtue gathers in the unity of the Dao, and speech rests in the knowing that knows not—perfect indeed!

The unity of the Dao cannot be matched by virtue; what knowing cannot know, eloquence cannot express. To bear names like those of the Confucians and Mohists is perilous.

Thus the sea refuses no tributary stream—such is its boundless greatness. The sage embraces heaven and earth, bestowing blessings upon the world, yet none know his name. Therefore, in life he holds no rank, in death he leaves no legacy; his substance does not accumulate, his fame does not stand. This is called the Great Man.

A dog is not good because it barks well; a man is not worthy because he speaks well—how much less so for greatness!

To be great is not enough to be called great—how much less so for virtue! The greatest completeness is none other than heaven and earth; yet what do they seek? And so they are complete.

He who knows this completeness seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing, and does not exchange his self for things. Turning inward, he is inexhaustible; following the ancient, he does not wear away. Such is the sincerity of the Great Man.

*(Guo’s Commentary: The sage speaks no words; what he speaks are the words of the common people, hence “the speech that speaks not.” If one takes speech as non-speech, then though words issue from the mouth, they are as though never spoken. Now, to speak of the unspeakable here—Shi Nanyilaio and Sun Shu’ao settled lawsuits with silence, remaining serene while conflicts dissolved of themselves. If what is spoken is not one’s own, then though one speaks all one’s life, it is as though one has never spoken. Thus, to have a beak three feet long is not enough to be called long-tongued; for ordinary men, to close the mouth is not yet to be speechless. The former refers to the two disciples; the latter, to Confucius. The Dao’s capacity is without limit, yet its great return lies in nothing more than self-attainment—hence its unity. Speech stops at its proper place—what could be more perfect? Each attains for himself, not by sameness. Yet the Dao is one. Knowing what lies beyond one’s proper place, eloquence cannot express it. The Confucians and Mohists sought to make the same what cannot be made the same, to express what cannot be expressed—hence their peril. The sea receives all things without refusal, thus achieving its greatness. The sage, all-embracing and impartial, possesses yet does not possess. Titles and honors name achievements, but if the achievement is not one’s own, though honored, it is not one’s own. When all things are sufficient in themselves, substance does not accumulate; when merit is not self-made, fame does not stand. To claim possession is to be small. Worthiness arises from nature, not from speech. The greater something is, the less it can be attained by effort—only by spontaneity is it attained. Heaven and earth are complete of themselves, not by seeking. He who knows their self-completeness does not abandon himself to seek things—hence he seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing. Returning to guard his own principle, he is naturally at ease; following his constant nature, he naturally arrives. It is not by polishing but by non-doing that he attains—hence it is called sincerity.)*

*(Lü’s Commentary: The three men were not contemporaries; this is a parable. The so-called “speech that speaks not” does not mean having no beak. If one acts as the two disciples did, then though one has a beak three feet long, it is as though one has not spoken. What the two disciples did is called the Way that is not the Way. Confucius’ non-speaking is called the eloquence that speaks not—how could the world know this! What virtue cannot match, what eloquence cannot express, is truly without name. To rest in namelessness is where good fortune abides; otherwise, though one’s name resemble that of the Confucians or Mohists, one cannot escape reckless action—perilous indeed! The Dao in the world is like the hundred rivers to the sea: it receives them without refusal. The sage’s all-embracing bestowal of blessings is likewise. None know his name. Without rank, without legacy—this is how the sage is nameless, and thus great. To take good speech as worthiness is already impossible—how much more so for greatness! Could it lie in speech? Thus, what knowing cannot know, eloquence cannot express—yet there is the eloquence that speaks not. The sage does not strive to be great; to strive is not enough to be great—how much less so for virtue! The unity of the Dao cannot be matched by virtue—hence there is the Way that is not the Way. What makes the world complete is its self-completeness, without seeking. All men have what they call completeness—it is nothing but sincerity. Sincere, he seeks nothing; seeking nothing, he loses nothing, discards nothing, for he is sufficient in himself and does not exchange himself for things. The Great Man knows that in himself the ten thousand things are complete; thus, turning inward, he is inexhaustible. Enduring since high antiquity, he does not decay—hence following him does not wear away. Sincerity is to hit the mark without effort, to attain without thought, to accomplish without action.)*

*(Yi Du’s Commentary: In ancient times, one always made libation before drinking, showing reverence for what is honored. Sun Shu’ao and Shi Nanyilaio, attending the feast, received the wine and made libation, wishing Confucius to speak and teach them—hence they said, “The men of old all spoke at such gatherings.” Confucius had long wished to speak not, so he said, “I have heard of the speech that speaks not.” Never having spoken it, here he would speak it—intending to show that his words arose from non-speaking. When Bai Gong Sheng of Chu plotted rebellion and killed the Prime Minister Zixi, both sides sent envoys to summon Shi Nanyilaio. He was juggling his balls in play and paid no heed to the two envoys. Neither side could secure him, and both withdrew their troops.)*

Sun Shu’ao, at leisure and at ease, reclined in high repose, wielding his feather fan in contentment, so that enemy states dared not invade, and conflicts were resolved a thousand *li* away. Confucius cited these two men—who by non-action quelled crises—to illustrate the meaning of non-speaking. This speech arises from non-speaking; though one had a beak three feet long, it would not impair the power of non-speaking. That which is without speech and without action is called the Way that is not the Way—it is the constant Way. This speech that arises from non-speaking is called the disputation that is not disputation—it is the great disputation.

To unite all virtues and return to the Dao: the Dao can unify them, but virtue cannot. That which lies beyond the reach of knowledge can be grasped in silence, but not in argument. Those who vie for supremacy through virtue or vie for superiority through speech—those whose names align with the Ru or Mohists—cannot guard their lives with caution and secrecy, and thus calamity befalls them.

The sea’s greatness lies in its capacity to receive all things without refusal. The sage’s sageliness lies in embracing heaven and earth without knowing whose they are, ennobled by none yet ever natural. A *yi* of gold is established by merit, but once the merit is achieved, it is not claimed—then there is no *yi*. In life, one holds no rank, so no substance is amassed. In death, no *yi* remains, so no name is established. This is what is called the Great Person.

A dog skilled in guarding does not suffer reproach for not barking; a scholar skilled in conduct does not suffer reproach for not speaking. Speech is insufficient to achieve greatness—how much less so virtue? This is Confucius’ intent in wishing to speak not.

To be fully equipped is to be sufficient for use; to seek is to be insufficient. Heaven and earth have no intent toward the myriad things, yet the myriad things naturally fill the space between them—this is what is called great completeness. To prepare out of desire is but a lesser completeness.

To know great completeness, one must know non-seeking. With non-seeking, there is no loss; with no loss, there is no abandonment. Only then does one not exchange oneself for things. To return to oneself is to follow the ancients, never transgressing sincerity.

*(Bi Xu’s Commentary: "Juggling nine balls" refers to spinning spheres in the palm as a playful diversion. The *Guiguzi* speaks of the "nine-turning method of fierce beasts," meaning that sagely wisdom is inexhaustible, like the ceaseless turning of spheres, akin to the boundless ferocity of beasts. Thus, Shi Nanyilaio regarded the affairs of the world as spheres turning in his palm, sleeping sweetly in lofty seclusion, wielding his feather fan to command. Could such men as these be concerned with speech? In silence, they comprehended all—what harm was there in a long beak? Words arise and breath is born; what use are three seals? Thus, there is the Way that is not the Way, the disputation that is not disputation.

That which the Dao unifies is the very Way that is not the Way. To know what lies beyond knowing is the very disputation that is not disputation. Therefore, even those as eloquent as the Ru or Mohists only invite disaster. The sea’s depth and vastness come from its capacity to contain; the sage’s all-embracing nature leaves him nameless. In life, he does not display virtue; in death, he leaves no lingering reputation. Because no substance is amassed, no name is established—this is what is called the Great Person.

Talent is complete when it is not confined to a single vessel. The value of a person lies in attaining the Dao, not in eloquence. To accommodate all things is called greatness; to broadly aid is called virtue. Those who preserve greatness should be humble; those who possess virtue should be unassuming. Like heaven and earth, which cover and bear all without intent, they discard the key to the myriad things, nurturing and fostering, bringing to completion both the animate and inanimate. Only through selflessness and non-seeking is great completeness achieved.

To hide gold in the mountains and not mine it, to sink pearls in the abyss and not dive for them, to let the people return to simplicity and not abandon them—this is not to be swayed by things. Returning to the root without limit, following the ancients without erasure—the sincerity of the Great Person harmonizes with heaven and earth.

*(Juanzhai’s Commentary: "Juggling balls" is a playful act. Holding a feather fan and sleeping contentedly expresses the intent of non-action. The Master said these two men both practiced the action of non-action—what need was there for his words? "Would that I had a beak three feet long" means he wished he did not have such a long beak. That which the Dao unifies is the natural. Virtue is what one attains within oneself. What arises from human effort cannot align with the natural Dao—here, "virtue" differs from its use elsewhere in this text. Those whose names resemble the Ru or Mohists do not embody the disputation that is not disputation. "Not knowing whose they are" means there is nothing by which to name them. "No substance is amassed" means that goodness is not attributed to oneself.

The worthy do not regard eloquence as ability—how much less so the Great Person? The name of greatness is insufficient to make one great—how much less so the virtue of the natural, which defies all naming? Great completeness is great perfection. Only through non-seeking is there no loss and no abandonment. Not exchanging oneself for things means valuing oneself above things, which lies in returning to oneself. To follow the ancient Way is to act without effort.

Juggling spheres in the palm, turning endlessly, the mechanism of application lies within the square inch—this metaphor illustrates that the myriad changes of worldly affairs are all within human control. The enlightened observe them as mere play. Xiong Nanyilaio was a man of wisdom and courage from Chu. Sima Zitai said that if he were obtained, he could match five hundred men—thus his talent was evident. Dwelling in seclusion south of the market, he found contentment in this, regarding the affairs of the world as nothing worth pursuing. When Bai Gong Sheng plotted rebellion and coveted his assistance, how little he knew him! It was fitting that he juggled his spheres and paid no heed. Though this was but a playful act, it prevented Bai Gong’s rebellion and spared Zixi from disaster—resolving the crisis for both sides.

Sun Shu’ao, who thrice took office and thrice resigned without joy or resentment, was a man whose measure could not easily be taken. In deep sleep and unhurried repose, wielding his feather fan in leisurely discourse, he could make enemy states lay down their arms and retreat—this is what military strategy calls "subduing the enemy without battle." This is the Way that is not the Way, the disputation that is not disputation, which cannot be described even with a mouth. The Master wished for a beak three feet long only to discuss such matters—not that he literally had a beak of that length.

That which the Dao unifies is the ancestor of the myriad things, to which virtue naturally returns. To know what lies beyond knowing is the truth of the Dao, which cannot be conveyed in words. Thus, virtue cannot unify, and disputation cannot encompass it.)*

Though the Confucians and Mohists were renowned for their eloquence, even they had no ground for debate here.

The sage possesses a boundless capacity, bestowing grace upon all under heaven without claiming credit, and thus no titles or posthumous honors are established—both name and reality are forgotten. This is how one attains the great completeness of heaven and earth, which does not depend on words or deeds. Being complete, one seeks nothing from things; seeking nothing, one does not lose the Way; not losing the Way, one discards nothing of others. One dwells in the present while perpetually following the ancient, penetrating things without losing oneself, ever returning to sincerity as the foundation. When sincerity is present, true conduct manifests in things—how could transformation not follow?

Great completeness indeed—so vast is its scope. "Seeking nothing" should be repeated below, linking to the following text. Some versions read "不摩" as "不磨," which is more fitting.

Master Qi had eight sons. Lining them up before him, he summoned Jiufang Tan and said, "Examine my sons for me and tell me which is most auspicious." Jiufang Tan replied, "Kun is the most auspicious." Master Cai was startled with joy: "In what way?" He answered, "Kun will share the ruler’s table for the rest of his life." Master Jing wept bitterly and left, saying, "Why must my son come to such an extreme!" Jiufang Tan said, "To share the ruler’s table brings blessings to three clans—how much more to his parents! Now that you’ve heard this and weep, you are rejecting fortune. Your son is auspicious, but you are not."

Master Mo exclaimed, "Tan, how could you possibly know that Kun is auspicious? His fate is merely to be sated with meat and wine, filling his nose and mouth—how could you know its origin? I have never herded sheep, yet lambs are born in my inner chamber; I have never hunted quail, yet they hatch in my hearth. If you find this strange, why? Those with whom I wander are those who wander in heaven and earth. With them, I roam in joy beneath the sky and feast upon the earth. I do not involve myself in their affairs, nor in their schemes, nor in their anomalies. With them, I ride the sincerity of heaven and earth without clashing with things; I drift along with them, never aligning with worldly conventions. Yet now, such vulgar rewards befall us! Wherever there are strange omens, there must be strange conduct. Alas! This is not the fault of my son or me—it is heaven’s doing!" And so he wept.

Not long after, Kun was sent to Yan, where bandits seized him on the road. Keeping him whole would make escape too easy, so they severed his foot and sold him in Qi. There, he ended up on the street of Qu Gong, where he lived out his days eating meat.

Guo’s commentary: What seems strange arises from the unexpected. My wanderings have no fixed purpose; I simply follow wherever heaven and earth lead. Following the constant and acting naturally, one remains detached and self-so—this is non-action. Flowing without preference, one benefits things, and things repay accordingly. But I do not seek merit—why should I receive recompense? Without strange conduct, strange omens arise—thus we know it is heaven’s decree. If it comes from doing, then ceasing to act would stop it. But if it comes without action, there is nothing to be done—hence the tears.

Later, when Kun was sent to Yan, bandits captured him. Fearing he might escape if left whole, they cut off his foot to sell him more easily.

Lü’s commentary: This passage shows that Jiufang Tan’s divination was inferior to Master Cai’s understanding through the Way. Master Cai’s wandering with his sons in heaven and earth followed the principles of the perfected in preserving life. Yet strange omens appeared—knowing they were heaven’s gift, not earned by any action.

Yi Du’s commentary: The southwest corner of a room is called the *ao*, corresponding to the *wei* earthly branch, associated with sheep. The southeast corner is called the *tu*, corresponding to the *chen* branch, associated with quail. Sheep are obtained through herding, quail through hunting—these are human affairs. Yet lambs born in *wei* and quail in *chen* are the workings of heaven. Without engaging in such human affairs, why would strange meat and wine appear? This speaks to the principles of yin-yang and destiny, which humans cannot evade.

I wander with Kun in heaven and earth. What we encounter in heaven, we enjoy without refusal; what we encounter on earth, we consume without refusal. I do not involve myself in affairs—this is the Way. I do not engage in schemes—this is principle. I do not concern myself with anomalies—this is the constant. Thus, I ride the sincerity of heaven and earth without clashing with things. Worldly conventions are not my concern. Yet now, there is the omen of sharing the ruler’s table—this is merely the world’s reward for his form. Where there are extraordinary omens, there must be extraordinary conduct. But neither my son nor I have such conduct—this omen is heaven’s gift.

All things that reach extremes are attributed to heaven by the sage. What heaven decrees is simply to be accepted. Qu Gong was a wealthy merchant.

Bi Xu’s commentary: Reaching such an extreme, one meets fortune with fear. The father is deemed inauspicious—he rejects blessings. Meat and wine enter the nose and mouth, speaking to external abundance. Not knowing their origin speaks to receiving emolument without merit—like never herding or hunting, yet sheep and quail suddenly appearing in the house, which is indeed strange. Wandering in heaven and earth is harmony with nature. Roaming in joy beneath the sky is delighting in custom. Feasting upon the earth is savoring its bounty. Not acting is preserving the center; not scheming is following one’s nature; not finding anomalies strange is adhering to the constant. Riding the sincerity of heaven and earth is embodying the Way. Not clashing with things is following principle. Not aligning with worldly conventions is non-action. True merit leaves no trace, yet worldly affairs bring recompense. Without strange conduct, one nears heaven’s decree—though fate is fixed and inescapable, one cannot help but feel fear. Thus, he wept.

Jiufang Tan relied on his divination, while Master Cai alone saw through the Way. Therefore, cultivation and effort cannot avoid calamity—all is destiny.

Wu Chou’s Annotation: Jiufang Tan exhausted his divination by relying on finite calculations, his knowledge bounded by limits. Thus, in his physiognomy, he recognized only the auspiciousness of lifelong feasting alongside the lord of the state, yet failed to foresee the misfortune of mutilation that would maim his life—no greater inauspiciousness exists. Therefore, Master Cai’s shedding of tears was indeed a portent.

From *Yanzhai’s Oral Exegesis*: Never having herded nor tilled, yet sheep and quails appeared in his chamber—this strange occurrence serves as a metaphor: if neither I nor you seek anything from the world, how could there be a matter of feasting alongside the lord of the state? I follow heaven and delight in it; I adapt to earth and nourish myself by it. Without affairs, without schemes, not engaging in anomalies yet aligning wholly with nature, I dare not respond to matters nor discern what is fitting or unfitting. While I rejoice in non-action, what they describe is thus: there remains this unpaid debt of worldly custom—truly a strange portent. If you do not invite such things, they will surely come with strange conduct. The alley of Qu Gong is but a gate facing the street, a place of leisure.

Jiufang Tan discerned men through his art, while Ziyuan divined affairs through principle. The physiognomer knew the auspiciousness of feasting on meat yet overlooked the mutilation; the principle-based diviner feared blessings beyond fate yet rested in the constant. This pertains to fixed destiny, which human effort cannot alter. How can one know that art does not penetrate principle, or that principle does not encompass art? What then is the distinction between auspiciousness and inauspiciousness? Observe the old man at the frontier whose horse, or the deer in the plantain grove—what indeed are their gains and losses? He who knows destiny merely listens.

Now Master Cai, though he never herded nor tilled, suddenly found sheep and quails born in his chamber—how could this not be strange, and how could he not wonder at their origin? Moreover, you and I follow the Way of delighting in heaven, savor the bounty of earth, do not engage in cunning schemes, and ride the sincerity of heaven and earth. Thus, we do not clash with things, forget the fitting in affairs, and entrust ourselves wholly to the Way of nature. Yet to speak of feasting alongside the lord of the state is a worldly desire, not our aspiration. Without strange conduct, yet encountering this strange portent—is this not heaven’s decree? If one knows it is heaven’s decree, why then weep?

Yet the perfected one illuminates the subtleties of principle, contemplates the vicissitudes of affairs, and knows that the greatest blessings arise from the depths of misfortune—nothing arrives without cause. Thus, he cannot help but weep. Before long, the mechanisms of fortune and misfortune, their mutual dependence, would unfold below.

The physiognomer predicted feasting alongside the lord of the state, yet later he ate in the alley of Qu Gong. *Pronunciation and Meaning Annotation*: Qu Gong was a wealthy household in Qi, serving as the street’s overseer. Comparing this to the earlier prediction of mutilation, the art of physiognomy was not entirely verified, unlike principle-based divination, which adheres to the Way without seeking fortune.

The Wulin Daoist Chu Boxiu’s Study of *Xu Wugui*, Chapter Six

Nie Que encountered Xu You and asked, “Where are you going?”
“I am fleeing from Yao.”
“What do you mean?”
“Yao, with his boundless benevolence—he will surely become a laughingstock to the world. Future generations may well devour one another. The people are not difficult to gather: love them, and they draw near; benefit them, and they come; praise them, and they are encouraged; bring them what they detest, and they scatter. Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness, yet those who discard benevolence and righteousness are few, while those who profit from them are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness is neither sincere nor genuine—it is but a tool for the rapacious and predatory. Thus, when one man’s judgment governs the benefit of all under heaven, it is like a single glance. Yao knew that worthy men could benefit the world, yet he did not see how they could harm it—only those beyond the pale of worthiness understand this.”

There are those who are *warmly self-satisfied*, those who are *moist and dependent*, and those who are *coiled and burdened*.

The *warmly self-satisfied* learn the words of a single master, then glow with private delight, believing themselves complete, unaware that nothing has truly begun. These are the *warmly self-satisfied*.

The *moist and dependent* are like lice on a pig: they choose sparse bristles, imagining them a vast palace or grand park, nestling between hooves and hocks, teats and thighs, believing themselves in a secure and advantageous abode. They do not know that one morning, the butcher will roll up his sleeves, spread straw, and light the fire—leaving them scorched along with the pig. These advance and retreat within their narrow bounds—such are the *moist and dependent*.

The *coiled and burdened* is Shun. Mutton does not long for ants, yet ants long for mutton—because mutton is rank. Shun had a rank nature, and the people delighted in him. Thus, with three migrations, he founded cities, and by the time he reached Deng’s ruins, a hundred thousand households had gathered. Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from the barren soil, saying, “I hope to receive his beneficent influence.” Shun was raised from the barren soil, his years advanced, his hearing and sight declined, yet he could not retire—such is the *coiled and burdened*.

Therefore, the spirit-person detests the thronging of the masses, for where the masses gather, there is no harmony, and where there is no harmony, no benefit arises. Thus, one must have no extreme attachments, no extreme estrangements, embracing virtue and kindling harmony to follow the world—this is the true person.

Discard knowledge like the ant, find strategy like the fish, abandon intention like the sheep. With the eye, see the eye; with the ear, hear the ear; with the heart, return to the heart. Those who do so are as level as a carpenter’s line, their transformations following the natural course.

Guo’s Annotation: Benevolence is the root of contention. Once benevolence and righteousness are practiced, pretense will arise to serve them. Their traces become visible, and the rapacious will borrow these tools to achieve their ends. If benevolence and righteousness each arose from genuine feeling, then judgment would not rest with a single man. *Tui* means to sever. The myriad things take myriad forms, yet to sever them with a single measure is to wound them. Only by standing beyond worthiness can one avoid pretense.

Intent exhausts form, and teaching exhausts intent—how could they know my solitary transformation in the mysterious and obscure realm? Those who lack the talent to comprehend change and transcend the world, contenting themselves with momentary gain, are but lice on a pig.

The sage’s form does not differ from that of ordinary people, so while the use of ears and eyes may decline, the spirit remains whole. If one is immature in youth and declines in old age, can the sage’s sagacity and wisdom endure but a morning? The masses come of their own accord, not because they are sought. Clearly, Shun’s acquisition of the world arose from necessity, not from seeking advantage. For the people, it was a blessing; for Shun, it was bodily toil.

Ants, fish, and sheep—none can be without their ears, eyes, hearts, or intentions. Thus, they cannot abandon the carpenter’s line to find their own level, nor sever their traces to achieve mysterious union.

Lü’s Annotation: The affairs of Shun and Yu—I understand them now. They are but tools for the rapacious. To call them benevolence and righteousness is still to be bound by knowledge, and knowledge separates one from the realm of form, which is not universally affirmed. When one man’s judgment governs the benefit of all under heaven, it is like a single severing—it does not assist the natural course of things, bending to complete them without omission. This is the root of great disorder, arising between Yao and Shun, its branches lingering a thousand generations hence.

Taking warmth as right, one does not know the world has ultimate sufficiency; taking beauty as right, one does not know the world has ultimate beauty. Thus, those who learn the words of a single master, believing themselves complete while unaware that nothing has truly begun—these are named accordingly.

*Ru* means not to depart; *xu* means to depend. Content in lowliness and filth, unaware of disaster—thus they are named after lice on a pig. Coiling and grasping, not concealing their rankness, causing the world to long for and flock to them—thus they are named after Shun.

From learning the words of a single master, unaware that nothing has truly begun, one becomes *moist and dependent* in benefit and *coiled and burdened* in harm. If Shun’s advancement is spoken of in terms of the world, what does it add to me? It is enough to weary the body—hence the term *coiled and burdened*.

Though the masses come and gather, even as with Yao and Shun, the spirit-person detests it. Not aligning with them, they bring no benefit. This is why the true person has no extreme attachments or estrangements, embracing virtue and kindling harmony to follow the world.

The world delights and gathers, and Shun delights and follows. Shun saw the world as a worn-out sandal, yet what made him Shun saw Shun as dust, chaff, and husks—what else but the spirit and the true?

The ant, with its knowledge, is meddlesome; the fish, with its depth, preserves its life; the sheep, with its intention, is fierce. With the eye, see the eye, and the seer is attained. With the ear, hear the ear, and the hearer is attained. With the heart, return to the heart, and the knower is attained. Discard knowledge and intention, and conceal oneself in the profound and boundless, attaining the seer, the hearer, and the knower—then there is nowhere one does not find levelness, mending things naturally and without effort.

This is the Way to restore one’s true nature.

*Dú’s Annotation:* The law began with Fuxi, and governance was perfected under Yao. Yao was the origin from which the traces of the Seven Sages arose. By loving kinship, the people gather. By harmonizing with benefit, the people come. By exalting with praise, the people are encouraged. Imposing what they do not desire, the people scatter. Thus, in the world, those who abandon transformative righteousness are few, while those who profit from benevolence and righteousness are many—pursuing names and following traces, they depart from nature and enter artifice. Seeking to practice benevolence and righteousness without sincerity, the world’s rapacious, like beasts, will borrow these tools as means for burrowing and lodging. When all under heaven steal the name of benevolence and righteousness to plunder the world, there will inevitably come a time when men devour one another.

Moreover, for one man to wield the authority of benevolence and righteousness, decreeing and regulating for the benefit of all under heaven, is like glancing briefly and wishing to level the four seas—intending to benefit them, yet unwittingly harming all under heaven. The worthy, those renowned for benevolence and righteousness, are known only externally by those who deem themselves worthy, aligning with the *Laozi*’s principle of "not esteeming the worthy."

"Warmth" is self-comfort. "Beauty" is self-admiration. "Moist" is to be nourished. "Dependent" is to await. "Alley" is self-constriction. "Crouched" is self-restraint. These terms mock the vulgar scholars of the time, who, learning the words of a single master, cling to stale traces and obscure the sagely Way, delighting in their own warmth and beauty, unaware that the Dao resides in the beginning before things arose.

The *kui*’s form resembles a hoof, the curve of the body. Between the teats and thighs, warmth abides. Lice rely on the pig’s existence, finding safety and profit in moisture and dependence, unaware that when the butcher arrives, they will burn together with the pig. This illustrates that those in the world who cannot transcend their circumstances and remain dependent will not escape calamity. Thus, whether advancing or retreating within bounds, unless one possesses the talent to transcend the age and idly enjoy fleeting gains, all are "moist and dependent."

Shun received his mandate from Heaven; his truth lay within and did not manifest. His mere leftover earth and straightness sufficed to win the people’s admiration. Thrice he moved to evade Yao’s son, and the people followed of their own accord. "Barren soil" is land without grass or trees. Shun toiled for all under heaven without rest—this is what is meant by "crouched and restrained."

These three—warmth, moisture, and crouching—are not the true Dao. Thus, the spirit-like person detests the multitude’s arrival, and even when they come, does not privately favor them. Without partiality or estrangement, embracing virtue and kindling harmony to follow the world—this is what is meant by "true."

The ant’s knowledge is petty, the fish’s calculations deep, the sheep’s intentions fierce. The sage discards petty knowledge, attains deep calculation, and abandons fierce intention. With the eye, see the eye, that the seer may be attained. With the ear, hear the ear, that the hearer may be attained. With the heart, return to the heart, that the knower may be attained. In this way, one’s levelness is as a plumb line, and one’s transformations follow in order—yet this still does not sever traces to stand alone.

*Bìxū’s Annotation:* "Warm and soft, beautiful and fine" is self-delight. "Moist" is nourishment; "dependent" is a moment’s idleness. "Crouched" is a constrained, unyielding appearance. This metaphor rebukes shallow scholars, stubborn and self-satisfied, unaware that the great house of the Dao takes the exhaustion of principle and the fulfillment of nature as the state before things ever arose. To idle in comfort while moist is to "advance within bounds"; to meet disaster without awaiting a moment is to "retreat within bounds." Even one like Elai, who followed Zhou and was executed with him, what difference is there from the pig and its lice?

The sage treats all things as straw dogs, without attachment or reliance. Yet the people’s allegiance is like ants drawn to a rank scent—wherever he goes, a market forms in a year, a town in two, a city in three. Dengxu was the name of a settlement. "Barren soil" is land without grass or trees. Yao raised Shun to succeed him, hoping all under heaven would receive his grace. Shun, his work complete and years advanced, could not rest—this was the result of the rank scent of benevolence and righteousness. When merit is achieved, the multitude arrives and praises him; prolonged praise leads to estrangement, and eventually fear and scorn, which bring no benefit.

Only by being without partiality or estrangement and transcending worthiness can the people not flock in admiration—this is to "abandon knowledge like the ant." To forget one another in rivers and lakes is to "attain the fish’s calculation." Serene and without action, joyfully transforming through virtue, the people know their ruler yet do not gather like ants drawn to a scent—this is to "abandon intention like the sheep." Withdrawing sight and reversing hearing, extinguishing the heart, following inclination to achieve levelness, naturally aligning with the plumb line, responding to things and adapting to change without failing to follow principle.

*Yuànzhāi’s Oral Teachings:* "Warm and beautiful" describes shallow vision and self-satisfaction, mocking scholars who do not grasp the wonder of "never yet having had things." "Moist and dependent" refers to those fixated on fame and profit. The *kui*’s hoof and curved flank are where lice dwell, believing themselves secure, unaware of their unreliability. "Bounds" is a metaphor for confining the heart to wealth and honor. "Alley and crouched" describe a self-tormenting appearance, as when cultivators of virtue take pride in their names, and people flock to them, only to find it burdensome, never resting their whole lives. This is used to satirize rulers of action.

Embracing virtue and kindling harmony, nurturing one’s power without display.

The ant, though most minute, cannot be utterly devoid of knowledge; the sheep, though most foolish, cannot be utterly devoid of intention. The true person, however, is without knowledge and without intention. As fish are content in water, so too does the true person act with calculation. Water is a metaphor for the Creator, the fish for the self; the true person’s heart, ears, and eyes are the same as others’, yet they employ them without heart—thus the eye sees for the eye, the ear hears for the ear, the heart returns to the heart.

The plumb line is the natural level; change is to follow it, to comply with its movement. Nie Que and Xu You both valued their authenticity in governing themselves, never regarding the world as their concern. Observing their discourse, one sees they were not inept at governance—like a chef who knows the bounds of his wine vessels and cutting boards. Wandering within or beyond the world, there is only a distinction of toil and ease.

Now, benevolence and righteousness are the foremost of the Five Constants and cannot be lightly disparaged. Yet later generations, in practicing them imperfectly, often mistake the trace for the tread, losing their authenticity. Once they depart from nature and follow emotion, benevolence and righteousness no longer arise from effortless action; self-interest lingers within, inevitably leading to pretense. Seeming yet not being, this truly harms the Way. Thus, the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, which return to purity and restore the root, reject them. Yet as for the utmost benevolence and great righteousness—those that encompass heaven and nurture all things, establishing the human standard in accord with the Dao and virtue—what rejection could there be?

As for Yao, who was deemed shallow, Xu You feared being ridiculed by the world. For he discerned the shadow and knew the form, seeking to flee and avoid future calamity. Generally, governing the world should be through non-action, allowing self-transformation. If one diligently seeks to benefit and aid, strength may fail, and pretense will follow. Once pretense arises, harm proliferates. Those above should take the hearts of the common people as their own; though they may not practice benevolence and righteousness, they will unwittingly align with them. Otherwise, it is like lending the tools of silk and nets to one who values fowl—such harm to creatures only grows worse. Thus, when a single ruler’s decisions seek to benefit the world, it is like glimpsing for a moment and claiming to comprehend the conditions of all things under heaven. They know only the advantage of exalting the worthy, not the harm it brings to later generations. Only those who stand beyond worthiness can see this, transcending by a head’s height to perceive the truth.

Later, Shu cited "warm and beautiful," "crouched and coiled," and "moist and dependent" to substantiate the earlier meaning, elaborating in great detail, with all explanations thoroughly expounded.

The spirit-person abhors the multitude’s arrival. The next two lines speak of the people’s allegiance to Yao, and Yao’s elevation of Shun, which pleased the hearts of all—all natural principles, not comparisons for profit. Thus, without partiality or estrangement, they followed virtue to accord with the world. This is the true person’s verification of responding to the world with their remaining threads.

The three phrases about ants, fish, and sheep were spoken in regard to Shun’s usurpation, with remarkably apt wording. First the ant, then the sheep, and lastly the fish. Not swayed by the scent of mutton, the ant abandons knowledge. Not moved by usurpation to impress others, the sheep abandons intention. In this way, superiors and inferiors each rest in their place, without longing for the traces of sageliness or exalting worthiness. Like fish content in the depths, forgetting one another in rivers and lakes—is this not a sound strategy?

Only then can one see with the eye without being dazzled by color, hear with the ear without being confused by sound, and return the heart to the heart without being enslaved by knowledge. Thus, the eyes of the world may be unified, the ears harmonized, and the hearts fully realized. Their level is like the plumb line, a model for the world; their response to affairs and changes follows the natural principle, without private interest in things, without harming the nature of things. What worry could there be that the world will not transform itself, that one must govern it with intention?

The multitude takes fame and profit as its bounds; the many lice take the pig’s body as their bounds. Advancing and retreating are like success and failure.

*Beginning of Volume Eighty-One of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu’s Study
*Chapter Seven: Xu Wugui*

The true person of antiquity treated it with Heaven, not allowing the human to intrude upon Heaven.

The true person of antiquity: when they attained it, they lived; when they lost it, they died. When they attained it, they died; when they lost it, they lived. Medicines—such as *ge* (plantain), *jiegeng* (balloon flower), *jiyong* (wild ginger), and *shiling* (pig’s ear)—in their time become sovereign remedies. How can they all be enumerated!

Goujian, with three thousand armored soldiers, took refuge on Mount Kuaiji. Only Minister Zhong knew how a state on the verge of ruin could be preserved, yet he did not know why his own person would come to grief.

Thus it is said: the owl’s eyes have their proper use; the crane’s sinews have their proper measure. To sever them is sorrow.

Thus it is said: when the wind passes over the river, it diminishes it; when the sun passes over the river, it diminishes it. If only the wind and sun were to guard the river together, the river would still consider itself untouched, for it relies on its source and flows onward.

Thus, water guards the earth with precision; a shadow guards a person with precision; things guard things with precision.

Therefore, the eye’s reliance on clarity is perilous; the ear’s reliance on acuity is perilous; the heart’s pursuit of its objects is perilous. All abilities stored in the treasury are perilous; once peril is established, it cannot be amended.

Disaster’s growth is ever-concentrated; its reversal is a gradual achievement; its fruition awaits time. Yet people regard it as their own treasure—is this not lamentable?

Thus, the ruin of states and the slaughter of peoples never cease, for none inquire into the cause.

*Guo’s Commentary:*
Abiding in affairs and awaiting affairs, affairs are thereby attained. Seeking non-affair through affair only deepens disorder.

Life and death, gain and loss—each follows where one abides. In life, it is gain; in death, some deem it loss. Thus, what is needed is without baseness; what is untimely is without value. Each suits the use of its time; if none is deemed impossible, then there are times of loss and times of sorrow.

All that has form naturally burdens itself; only that which lies beyond form may be ground yet remain unscathed. Like wind and sun passing over the river, though the river is truly diminished, it does not perceive it, for it relies on its source and flows onward.

Without intention, one halts at the proper measure—this is precision. With intention, there is no limit—thus peril. Therefore, the value lies in non-ability, in following natural spontaneity. If one cannot forget knowledge, disaster grows manifold. Returning to guard one’s nature, then achievement is unmade yet complete.

Seeking speed precludes fruition.

"One’s treasure" refers to knowledge and ability. Thus, the disasters of ruin and slaughter all arise from one’s own errors. Not knowing to inquire into the source of disaster in the heart, and instead cultivating the heart to avert disaster.

*Lü’s Commentary:*
Treating it with Heaven, one responds without action. Not allowing the human to intrude upon Heaven, though one acts, it is as if one has not acted.

The true person knows neither life nor death. At times, attaining it means life; losing it means death—this is for those who take life lightly. At times, attaining it means death; losing it means life—this is for those who abhor death.

Like medicines, some are sweet, some are poisonous; at times they serve as sovereign, but not always—the rest are mere ministers and assistants. To regard life as gain and death as loss is the medicine for those who take life lightly. To regard life as loss and death as return is the medicine for those who abhor death. Prescribing according to the illness, their transformations cannot all be enumerated.

Minister Zhong knew how a ruined Yue could be preserved, yet he did not know why his own person would come to grief—like the crow’s eye, which sees at night but not by day, its use cannot be shifted. The crane’s sinews can be long but not short; their measure cannot be severed. Severing them binds one to form, not knowing the source.

Wind and sun passing over the river do diminish it, yet the river deems itself untouched, for it relies on its source and does not run dry. One who penetrates the Dao adapts to all things, yet has a source.

Water, in relation to earth, reaches every crevice of insect burrows and ant nests; a shadow, in relation to a person, follows sitting, rising, walking, and stopping—these are without emotion yet guard with precision.

The ear’s hearing, the eye’s seeing, the heart’s thinking—none ever depart for an instant. Thus, things guard things with precision, yet their acuity, clarity, and intent are not like water and shadow, which are without emotion. Therefore, they cannot but be perilous.

All abilities stored in the treasury bring harm. The treasury refers to the five viscera; peril means becoming complacent in what is unsafe. If it cannot be amended, disaster grows concentrated.

Only because delusion is not of a single day does its reversal require gradual achievement; its fruition awaits time. The superior person thus reduces and reduces again, for peril cannot be allowed to take form.

Yet the world regards it as their own treasure—is this not lamentable?

*Yi Du’s Commentary:*
Treating the human with Heaven is sincerity manifesting as clarity. Allowing the human to intrude upon Heaven is clarity manifesting as sincerity. Without gain or loss, without life or death—this is what is called the profound.

*Dong* (aconite), *wuhui* (monkshood), *jiyong* (wild ginger), and *ai* (mugwort) are the basest of medicines, yet in their time they can cure illness, alternating as sovereign and minister. Gain and loss, poverty and success—there is no difference in this. The world falsely esteems the noble and despises the base, not knowing that use and disuse depend solely on timing.

Once, King Goujian of Yue took refuge with his troops on Mount Kuaiji. Minister Zhong knew how a ruined state could be preserved, yet he did not know his own person would perish—like the gull’s eye, which is dim by day and bright by night, or the crane’s sinews, which can be long but not short, each suiting the advantage of its time. To sever their proper use is sorrow for what is pursued, for one cannot escape partiality.

Yin and yang possess qi; the myriad things possess form. Qi is subtle; form is coarse. Qi grinds against form, and form must be diminished. Wind and sun are the qi of yin and yang; river water is that which has form. Wind and sun passing over the river must diminish it, yet though they guard it together, the river feels no disturbance, for it relies on its source. This illustrates how one abides amid yin and yang, daily diminished yet relying on fate to endure.

Water to earth, shadow to form, thing to thing—all guard one another without intent; thus their guarding is precise. Yet though precise, they cannot escape the subtle shifts of creation’s workings. Yesterday’s thing is already transformed today, yet the deluded remain unaware of this.

Ears, eyes, and heart in their pursuit—none can avoid peril. All abilities, when drawn from the storehouse of the viscera, become enslaved to what they serve. Once peril has fully formed, to seek swift correction is already too late; thus calamity grows ever more severe. If one returns to the root and restores one’s nature, all proceeds smoothly and bears fruit. To see one’s affairs come to fruition requires patient waiting. Yet世人 regard manifold skills as their treasure—this is what the perfected ones lament. They contend over cities and lands, slaughtering innocent people, unaware of the origins of the disasters they bring.

*Bi Xu’s annotation:* To await others with Heaven, letting things follow their nature. Not to impose human artifice upon Heaven, for falsity cannot match truth.

To gain it is life, to lose it is death—this is shared with all things. To gain it is death, to lose it is life—this sets one apart from all things. The myriad things flourish when they meet their time, wither when they miss it. The true person flourishes not when meeting their time, nor withers when missing it—like the herbs *dong*, *geng*, *yong*, and *ling*, though humble things, yet when a skilled physician employs them in treatment, they become sovereign. This illustrates how the true person governs the world, ever in accord with the times.

One who can preserve a state cannot save their own person—like a physician who treats others’ illnesses yet cannot cure their own. The gull’s eye and crane’s sinews, each suited or unsuited to its time, illustrate how one may possess talent and knowledge yet still not escape calamity. Wind blows and sun bakes, river water dwindles and cries out; slander runs deep and flattery enters, loyal ministers lose power—what one relies upon most heavily is not lightly disturbed.

Water parted from earth scatters; shadow parted from person vanishes; thing parted from thing empties; person parted from the Dao perishes. Only those who guard with utmost care approach wholeness!

Eyes in pursuit: Li Zhu. Ears in pursuit: Shi Kuang. Heart in pursuit: Zeng and Shi. None have avoided peril! Weighing merits and faults, the fruits of good and evil—these are not yet visible before one’s eyes. Yet世人 cling to merit as their treasure, and disaster follows on their heels—such was the case with Minister Zhong.

*Yanzhai’s Oral Exegesis:* Not to impose intent upon the principles of nature is called "not imposing human artifice upon Heaven." Life and death, gain and loss—all are left to nature. To call life "gain" is acceptable, to call death "gain" is also acceptable; to call life "loss" is acceptable, to call death "loss" is also acceptable. Like a physician using herbs, the sovereign becomes the ruler, the rest become ministers; though the herbs are the same, their use varies in weight. So too with people in the world: meeting their time, they are noble; missing it, they are base—yet in oneself, there is no duality.

Minister Zhong, in avenging Yue against Wu, could seek survival amid ruin—this was wisdom! Yet he did not know to turn back and thus brought about his own death. The gull’s eye and crane’s sinews are again cited, along with the metaphor of wind and sun both able to diminish water, yet the river never feels disturbance, for its source is long. Thus, though things may diminish oneself, one feels no disturbance.

These five phrases form a single idea: water and earth intermingle, form and shadow depend on one another, things guard things—this is the principle of nature. The pursuit of things by eyes and heart is not natural. All knowledge issuing from the chest’s storehouse, taken as ability, leads to peril.

*Ji* means "to reach." *Fan* means "to overturn." The heart set on scheming for merit must lead to ruin. Those who plan with patient endurance remain steadfast and unchanging. All this harms the person, yet世人 regard it as their treasure. From ancient times to the present, the ruin of states and slaughter of people have never ceased—this is because they do not question its origins.

To await others with Heaven is self-evident in meaning: to take Heaven’s principles as primary, and let human affairs follow. To impose human artifice upon Heaven is to take human affairs as primary, and thus violate Heaven’s principles.

The phrase "the true person of ancient times" should be "thus," as the previous text contains a redundant repetition. To gain this Dao and live, to lose it and die—this is the constant principle. Yet to gain this Dao and die, to lose it and live—this arises from the vicissitudes of human affairs. Like the short-lived Yan and long-lived Peng, or the herbs *wuhui* and *shiling*, applied according to the condition: when sovereign, they rule; when assisting, they serve. Appropriate to their time, they have no fixed role.

Zhong’s skill in statecraft was matched by his clumsiness in preserving his own person—like the gull’s eye and crane’s sinews, each suited to its time. To force what one cannot do is sorrow. Again, the metaphor of wind and sun passing over the river, which cannot avoid diminution, yet remains undisturbed by relying on its source. Then how can one avoid the disturbance of gain and loss, advantage and harm? To remedy this, the Dao is the source. For all things that come, if one does not admit them into the numinous storehouse, one’s source remains strong. The rise and fall of events are no more than mosquitoes passing before one—what disturbance could there be?

Water’s guarding of earth is a principle of mutual support, yet truly without intent. Shadow’s guarding of form arises from what it issues from and cannot be without. Things guarding things each generate their own intent; though their guarding is precise, they mutually generate and overcome, now flourishing, now flowing—like what is described in the *Outer Things* chapter—thus they cannot avoid peril. How much more so when ears, eyes, and heart pursue things as ability! Once peril has formed, correction comes too late—such calamity is indeed long-lasting.

To return to the root, one must focus on correcting faults, waiting patiently for gradual success. Yet世人 take keen senses and clever minds as their treasure—this is what the true person pities. The ruin of states and slaughter of people are the greatest of disasters, yet their beginnings lie in the pursuit of things by ears, eyes, and heart. The key is to check their source!

Thus the foot’s treading upon the earth is but slight, yet though slight, it relies on what it does not tread to achieve its full reach. Human knowledge is scant, yet though scant, it relies on what it does not know to grasp what Heaven calls it to know.

To know the Great Oneness, to know the Great Yin, to know the Great Eye, to know the Great Balance, to know the Great Square, to know the Great Faith, to know the Great Stillness—this is perfection.

The Great Oneness unites it; the Great Yin dissolves it; the Great Eye sees it; the Great Balance levels it; the Great Square embodies it; the Great Faith verifies it; the Great Stillness sustains it.

In exhausting what Heaven possesses, follow what illuminates; in obscurity, hold to the pivot; in beginning, there is the other.

Thus its dissolution resembles non-dissolution; its knowing resembles non-knowing—only through non-knowing does knowing arise.

In questioning it, one cannot be bound by limits, yet cannot be without limits. What is tangled yet real, ancient and modern yet unchanging and unalterable—can this not be called the great raising and sifting?

Why then remain perplexed? To resolve perplexity with non-perplexity and return to non-perplexity is to attain the greatest non-perplexity.

The Great Oneness is the Dao. Employing what lies within its bounds, the myriad affairs encounter no obstruction. Using the self-manifestation of the myriad things is the Great Eye. Following their inherent nature, allowing each to attain its own, is the Great Balance. Embodying them so each attains its proper place—thus the ten thousand directions all find their due—this is the Great Square. What is ordained by destiny, allowing no transgression, is the Great Faith. When the true is unshaken, it naturally settles; sustaining it with the Great Stillness is to sustain nothing at all.

No thing is without its spontaneity; following it brings clarity, without contrivance. The utmost principle has its limit—only by obscuring it does one grasp its pivot. What begins with the other is the other; thus I am deluded and do not act. Dissolving the other by relinquishing it, the other dissolves itself. Dissolution without effort resembles non-dissolution. Using the other’s knowing resembles non-knowing. When I do not know, the other’s knowing operates of itself; when the other’s knowing operates of itself, nothing in the world fails to know. Responding to things obscurely and without fixed form, each according to its portion—the myriad things, though tangled and disparate, each possesses its own reality, none replaceable by another. To crush and raise them has its great limit.

If one questions their great essence, things have their ultimate bounds; thus the principle of forgetting the self and entrusting things may be known—why then remain perplexed in this way? Since perplexity cannot be resolved, to esteem the greatest non-perplexity is the height of folly. The sage follows and entrusts it, hence the sovereign kings differ in their accounts, adapting their names to the age.

The foot treads but little; relying on what it does not tread, it achieves its full reach—this is what is meant by knowing non-use and only then speaking of use. Human knowledge is scant; relying on what it does not know, it grasps what Heaven calls it to know—thus the Great Oneness, Great Yin, and so on to the Great Stillness may all be known.

Those who practice the Way take the Great Oneness as their master, and nothing is not penetrated. Entering the gate of profound obscurity, reaching the source of utmost yin, one also attains the source of utmost yang. Things bear yin and embrace yang, thus they are bound and cannot be dissolved—because they do not know the source of utmost yin.

The eye’s vision is limited; not seeing with the eye, there is nothing unseen. To level the one is not yet to balance; harmonizing with right and wrong, allowing both to proceed, is to level with the Great Balance. Without south or north, without east or west—embodying the Great Square. Its essence is most true, within it lies faith—verified by the Great Faith. Marshes burn yet are not hot; rivers freeze yet are not cold; thunder splits mountains, winds shake seas, yet one is not startled—sustained by the Great Stillness.

Exhausting what Heaven possesses is to halt at what knowledge does not know. Following what illuminates, though one does not know, there is nothing unknown. In obscurity, holding to the pivot, neither this nor that finds its counterpart. Beginning with the other, one responds to the other. This is indeed inexhaustible.

Its dissolution resembles non-dissolution, for originally there was no bond—thus only after non-dissolution does dissolution occur. Its knowing resembles non-knowing, for originally there was no knowing—thus only after non-knowing does knowing arise. This is how the utmost person wanders among the vulgar, appearing foolish and clumsy.

To question with or without limits is still to be bound. Limits mean seeking from one’s own edge. Yet one cannot seek between being and non-being. What is tangled cannot be bound; what is slippery cannot be grasped—like nothing yet real, past and present unchanging and unalterable. Can one not call this the great raising and sifting?

To raise is to bring forth the hidden; to sift is to examine the real. If the other does not question this, I cannot inform it with this. Only by seeing that there has never been a thing can one be without perplexity. Resolving the perplexity of there being things while still preserving the state of there never having been a thing is still perplexity. Only by dissolving it and returning to non-perplexity does one approach the greatest non-perplexity.

The Great Oneness is Heaven; the Great Yin is Earth. The Great Eye is Heaven seeing all; the Great Balance is Earth bearing all. The Great Square gives birth to the myriad things and fully provides for them. The Great Faith responds to the myriad things without expectation. The Great Stillness stabilizes the myriad things without movement.

Knowledge begins with knowing and ends with nourishing it through non-knowing—what is known attains such subtlety, hence it is called perfection. When bound by calculation, value lies in unifying it. Yin governs coagulation; value lies in dissolving it.

The Great Eye has no intention to see, yet each thing comes and is beheld. The Great Balance has no intention to comply with things, yet each thing arrives and is harmonized. The Great Square is嫌于 lacking form, thus it takes ease as its form. The Great Faith is嫌于 unexamined, thus it is verified through the Dao. It concludes with the Creator, merely sustaining it.

The principles of the myriad things under Heaven each have their own Heaven. Observing them by following principle, there is illumination; observing them from obscurity, there is a pivot. With a beginning, there is an "other"; without a beginning, there are no things, no "other," and no self. Dissolution resembles non-dissolution; knowledge resembles non-knowledge. In all discussions that reach their ultimate, one doubts through non-knowledge and only then knows—this is perfection.

Questions with limits are incisive inquiries. Questions without limits are diffuse inquiries. Incisive inquiries may exhaust principle but cannot fully realize nature; diffuse inquiries may broaden knowledge but cannot return to simplicity—thus, neither is sufficient.

Slippery words often lack substance yet may contain truth. Past and present alternate, yet principle itself does not change. One who fully grasps principle is said to be "unfailing." As stated above, can this not be called a grand elucidation and critical discussion?

If a matter is impossible, then desist—why perplex oneself by pursuing it? When one’s own perplexity is resolved through non-perplexity, though the other may return to non-perplexity, the one who resolves perplexity remains greatly perplexed—this is Zhuangzi’s intent in dismissing words.

Master Bixu’s annotation: Earth is vast, yet what people tread upon is merely enough to hold their feet. It is by relying on the untrodden that one’s movement becomes boundless. The Dao is supremely subtle, yet what people know is only what can be spoken. It is by relying on the realm beyond words that one’s realization becomes inexhaustible. Thus, the perfected person takes non-use and non-speech as Heaven’s true calling.

The Great Oneness is wondrous existence; those who know it become expansively penetrating. The Great Yin is profound stillness; those who know it become effortlessly liberated. The Great Eye is Heaven’s radiance, clearly illuminating all. The Great Balance is level unity, harmoniously complying. The Great Square is undifferentiated, embodying all forms and functions. The Great Faith is sincerity, verifying all without exception. The Great Stillness is ultimate quiescence, sustaining all to manifest the above wondrous functions.

These seven terms all possess Heaven’s natural principles. Following principle brings clarity; in stillness, it operates spontaneously. Beginning is the Dao; what opposes the Dao is the "other." Effortlessly liberated, one resembles non-liberation. Naturally knowing, one resembles non-knowing. Only by knowing non-knowledge does one truly know—clarity deepens with illumination.

The Dao cannot be limited, yet seeking it cannot be without bounds. Myriad forms differ, but principle is one. Slipperiness is disparity. Past and present are not two; life and death naturally diverge. Principle cannot be diminished; life and death naturally possess it. Herein lies great elucidation and critical discussion—why not inquire into this Dao?

Knowing the Dao, one is no longer perplexed by this principle. Profound perplexity persists lifelong, unshaken by the foolish or the wise, like the crane’s classic that cannot be severed or the hare’s classic that cannot be extended. Endowment and reception of qi have their reasons; only those who silently accompany creation know this. To rely on worldly learning to return to non-perplexity is the act of a greatly perplexed person, vainly revering the state of great non-perplexity.

From *Yanzhai’s Oral Teachings*: The ground people tread upon is little; what they do not tread upon is vast. This illustrates that what people know is minimal, while what they do not know is Heaven. Not relying on what is known but on what is unknown, one can know Heaven.

The Great Oneness is the movement of creation. The Great Yin is ultimate stillness. The Great Eye is what sees. The Great Balance refers to distribution. The Great Square shares its body with the Great Void. The Great Faith is the principle of truth. The Great Stillness is what sustains the myriad things.

The beginning of no-thing must have something to initiate it. As the *Qiwulun* states: "Without that, there is no self"—this "that" refers to creation. Terms like Heaven, illumination, pivot, and "other" may be known and understood, yet they also resemble non-understanding and non-knowledge. Not daring to assume they can be known is to take non-knowledge as knowledge—this is true knowledge.

To inquire is to ask about the principle of creation; whether with or without limits, neither is sufficient. Slipperiness is rotation, speaking of creation as elusive. Though seemingly without thing, it is truly existent. Past and present share this creation, its use inexhaustible. Should this matter not be grandly elucidated and critically discussed? Yet people do not inquire into this principle—why doubt it? With this non-perplexing understanding, one resolves the world’s perplexities and returns to the realm of non-perplexity, approaching great non-perplexity!

It is merely the two words "non-perplexity" that inspire these lines, concluding the essay in a singularly marvelous way. The ground one treads upon is not as vast as what is untrodden; the matters one knows are not as numerous as what is unknown. Not relying on what is trodden or known but taking non-use as use—only then can one know Heaven!

The Dao of Heaven is unfathomable, admitting no conjecture. Thus, there is no place to apply knowledge in questioning it. To halt at what is unknown is true knowledge. The key lies in daily diminishing desires; when human desires are exhausted, Heaven’s principle appears.

From the Great Oneness and Great Yin to the Great Faith, all are known only after knowing Heaven. The Great Oneness unifies them: the Dao pervades all principles, penetrating the generation of the myriad things. They receive yang to form shapes and encounter yin to dissolve and transform, born from non-being and returning to non-being.

The Great Eye sees what others do not see. The Great Balance complies with things, allowing them to level themselves. The Great Square takes formlessness as its form. The Great Faith verifies without expectation. It concludes with the Great Stillness, sustaining it to respond to the world’s movements—ever non-acting.

To exhaust the heavenly principles is to reach the utmost of things’ naturalness; to follow illumination is to comply with principle and attain clarity of itself.

Within obscurity lies the pivot—silent yet ever in motion, originating from that other, harmonious yet never leading. Through non-dissolution, one dissolves the world’s entanglements; through non-knowing, one knows the secrets of the heavenly Dao.

What need is there to question or examine whether it has bounds or none? Thus, though it may seem like the babbling of a witless fool, true principle resides within—unchanging through ancient and modern times, each fulfilling its proper role. Can this not be called a great "raising and drawing forth"?

As the *Han History* states: "To raise and draw forth the past and present"—*raising* means to lift, *drawing forth* means to extend. Lifting and extending, one sets forth its purport.

Why do people not inquire into this, instead relying on their delusive, expansive "knowledge," blind to their own heavenly nature? How then can they comprehend what is meant by the primal power of Qian? This is because the mind’s heaven lacks illumination, and delusion obstructs it.

Thus, through non-delusion, one dissolves delusion, returning to non-delusion—this is the ultimate great non-delusion. Delusion is the falsity of wayward emotions; non-delusion is the truth of one’s original nature. If one still knows to revere and esteem this original truth—one’s natural self—then it is not yet the great non-delusion. If one truly attains the state of non-delusion, what delusion remains to be esteemed? What delusion remains to be dissolved?

A ruler of the Dao does not lord his state and position over others. A scholar of the Dao must uphold integrity and righteousness to correct his lord.

Though Lord Wu was fierce and difficult to sway, lacking the persuasive power of a ghostly counselor, he first spoke of fine steeds to open his mind, showing that even a ruler must have discerning eyes for his ministers. Thus, he began in opposition but ended in accord, gradually remedying his tyranny. The people acknowledged their own faults, and the innate goodness of human nature could not be wholly extinguished—like one exiled from his homeland who rejoices at the sight of a familiar face. Upon their reunion, he then offered blunt, unpalatable advice to awaken him to his errors.

Loving harmony and detesting treachery, he fulfilled the essentials of self-cultivation. Cultivating sincerity to resonate with Heaven and Earth, he exhausted the Way of governing a state. To have heard such words was a blessing for the altars of soil and grain—what need was there to act righteously for the people’s benefit or to lay down arms in pursuit of order?

When the Yellow Emperor beheld the Great Spirit, even the Seven Sages were confounded. This illustrates that when the six senses are benighted, the lord of the mind cannot shine alone—like asking the way of a horse-herding boy, one is not far from returning. Thus, the perfected take refuge in parables. If a wise ruler wishes to perceive the great Dao, he must cut off sagacity and discard knowledge, seeking it in the spirit that guards the mind while removing what harms the self. Then the Great Spirit will come of itself without being sought.

How could one like Lord Wu, who wearied his people to indulge his senses, ever attain the numinous and only then seek righteousness and disarmament?

Only when later rulers’ virtue was not pure and their pursuits not singular did the various scholars diverge in their aims, concealing their natures and turning toward the myriad things, no longer hoping to return to the root—thus drifting ever farther from the Dao.

Take the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, Bingists, and Huians—each clung to one partial view, believing the Dao was exhausted therein. Yet in the thrust and parry of their discourse, they too contributed to revealing the Dao’s wonders—like the man of Ying whose severed foot inspired the master carpenter’s skill.

It is also like having the talent of Xi Peng, which then enables the elevation of Guan Zhong, never allowing personal affection for Bao Shu to alter the choice.

The monkey’s arrogance hastened its demise; people’s admiration for the monkey’s appearance brought it renown—this serves to warn the world against pride and insolence. How could it compare to those who still their hearts and wither their forms, ever receding from worldly entanglements? Those who juggle pellets and wield feathers are difficult to free.

Jiu Fang discerned the essence without mentioning the missing leg; Xu You, fearing Yao’s seven offers, fled and departed—both perceived the subtle and knew the manifest, gaining advantage by disregarding worldly honor.

Dong, Geng, and Yongling became emperors in their time, illustrating how people shift their standards. The wind and sun, the river’s waters—each vies to sway the other, illustrating how transformation alters people.

Things that cling to things are indeed fixed, yet in the end cannot escape change; once changed, they are imperiled. Only one who knows contentment and relies on non-action, whose mind depends on non-knowing, exhausts their own heaven to illumine the heaven of things. Unconfused themselves, they dissolve the world’s confusion.

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin, *On Zeyang* (First Chapter)

When Zeyang traveled to Chu, Yi Jie spoke of him to the king, but the king did not summon him, and Yi Jie returned. Pengyang then asked Wang Guo, “Why did you not recommend me to the king?” Wang Guo replied, “I am not the equal of Gong Yuxiu.” Pengyang asked, “What does Gong Yuxiu do?” He answered, “In winter, he retreats alone to the river; in summer, he rests in the mountain thickets. If someone passes by and asks, he says, ‘This is my dwelling.’ Yi Jie could not do this—how could I presume to do so? And I am not the equal of Yi Jie. Yi Jie is a man without virtue but with cunning; he does not approve of himself, yet he uses this to mystify his connections, plunging headlong into the realm of wealth and honor. He does not assist others with virtue but assists in their dissipation. The frozen borrow garments in spring; the sweltering turn back to winter’s cool breeze.

The King of Chu is a man of imposing form and stern demeanor. In matters of punishment, he is as unforgiving as a tiger. If not for a flatterer’s deceptive virtue, who could sway him? Thus, the sage—when impoverished—makes his household forget their poverty; when prosperous, he makes kings and lords forget their ranks and titles, transforming their arrogance into humility. Toward things, he delights in harmony; toward people, he rejoices in the Dao’s communion while preserving himself. Thus, without speaking, he imparts harmony to others; standing beside them, he transforms them. In the proper relations of father and son, they return to their places, each inquiring of the other’s conduct. His influence on the human heart is as distant as this. Therefore, it is said: ‘Await Gong Yuxiu.’”

Guo’s Commentary:
Wang Guo cited Gong Yuxiu’s character to restrain Pengyang’s eagerness for advancement. He was not like Yi Jie, who coveted wealth and honor, forging connections and exhausting his knowledge of forms and names to curry favor with superiors. Yet when one exhausts oneself thus, virtue thins and reputation fades. Though he followed the seasons’ gifts, he could not meet Pengyang’s urgent needs. The sage, serene and desireless, finds joy in what he encounters, not valuing extravagance. Thus, his household does not know the bitterness of poverty. He轻爵禄而重道德,超然坐忘,不觉荣之在身,故使王公失其所以为高. He does not torment himself with things, communing with others without losing himself. When each attains their own fulfillment, harmony is drunk—what need is there for words? Turning to the wind, they yield, and fathers and sons each return to their proper places. His virtue aligns with heaven and earth, thus remaining still and undivided. He wished Pengyang to abandon the King of Chu and follow Yuxiu, using the wind of tranquility to calm the king’s restless heart.

Lü’s Commentary:
Gong Yuxiu, so free of desires, was right to be trusted by the king. The spirit is the common ground of human hearts, which can be entered through emptiness. Yi Jie claimed he could not enter it, yet his connections were already mired in the realm of wealth and honor. “Assisting in dissipation” means his virtue did not endure but daily waned. The frozen borrow spring’s garments in winter; the sweltering seek winter’s breeze in summer—this speaks of seeking in vain. The King of Chu was harsh and violent; without a flatterer’s deceptive virtue, none could sway him. To ask me to speak for you is beyond my ability. Only a flatterer can disrupt a ruler’s integrity; only true virtue can disrupt his depravity. The flatterer is Yi Jie; the true virtue is Yuxiu. I delight and forget poverty, so my household forgets it too. When the Dao is honored and virtue esteemed, ranks and titles are not enough to elevate one, so kings and lords are transformed from arrogance to humility. “Imparting harmony” means his virtue suffices to nourish the human heart—no words are needed. “Standing beside them, he transforms them” means no power is needed. Fathers and sons return to their places, preserving human relations. “Each inquiring of the other’s conduct” leaves no room for regret. When the human heart is so distant, its entanglements are untied. Gong Yuxiu’s character being as it is, speaking of him to the king would surely be believed. Thus, it is said: “Await Gong Yuxiu.”

Yi Du’s Commentary:
Pengyang of Lu, styled Zeyang. Yi Jie was a man of Chu. Wang Guo was a Chu minister. Gong Yuxiu was a recluse. Yi Jie lacked innate virtue but had worldly knowledge; he could not approve of himself through the spiritual Dao, plunging headlong into the realm of wealth and honor. This was enough to dissipate your virtue, not to assist you. Like the frozen borrowing spring’s garments or the sweltering awaiting winter’s breeze, seeking Wang Guo’s help was not urgent. Moreover, the King of Chu’s character was as fierce as a tiger; if not swayed by flattery, he must be transformed by true virtue. The sage, though poor, is joyful, so his household forgets their poverty. When prosperous, he does not regard ranks and titles as exalted, making kings and lords transform their arrogance into humility. Toward things, he is without opposition, delighting in harmony. Toward people, he rejoices in the Dao’s communion while preserving himself. Without speaking, others drink his harmony. Standing beside them, he transforms their goodness, making each father and son return to their proper places. Abiding in unity without action, the Dao naturally extends to others, thus distancing itself from worldly customs. It is better to abandon the King of Chu and follow Yuxiu.

Bi Xu’s Commentary:
Zeyang sought an audience with the king for the sake of profit and rank. Wang Guo cited the recluse to restrain his competitive ambition. “Without virtue but with knowledge” means valuing ornament over substance. “Not approving of himself” refers to using this to deceive, solidifying connections through cunning and drowning in desires. Aiding the frozen and sweltering is human effort; awaiting spring and winter is heaven’s timing. Wang Guo followed heaven’s timing and did not comply with human effort, thus correcting Zeyang’s error. When Lao Lai’s wife wove baskets and Bo Huan’s wife hired herself out to pound grain, their households forgot poverty. When Marquis Wen of Wei honored Duan Ganmu and Emperor Guangwu of Han befriended Yan Ziling, they forgot ranks and titles, transforming arrogance into humility. Delighting in harmony with things, he moved with the world without being sullied.

To delight in harmony with things is to blend one’s light without dazzling. The teaching without words is warm as spring, anchored in the nameless uncarved block, allowing people to transform themselves. When virtue’s transformation follows its natural order, people rest content in their places. The Way is simple and effortless, requiring no action, yet those who hasten forward exhaust themselves in pursuit of office, their hearts far removed from those of the Dao-attuned.

*The Yanzhai Oral Exegesis* states: The spirit is one’s natural endowment. To be infatuated with wealth and rank, unaware of the spirit’s naturalness, is to fail to approve of oneself. This is the path of mutual self-diminishment, hence it is called dissipation. One who is cold and receives clothing becomes warm as spring; one who is sweltering and receives a breeze becomes cool as winter. In human interactions, one must use one’s surplus to relieve another’s lack. Pengyang’s fondness for advancement revealed his deficiency; to instruct him in retreat was like offering water to one holding heat or clothing to one in cold—it would bring benefit. “Flatterers rectify virtue” means that only true petty men can humble themselves to serve others. When lords and nobles forget their ranks to honor scholars, they transform arrogance into humility. To take joy in investigating principle, to harmonize with things without contention, to preserve one’s authenticity, and to awaken without words—this is like offering the purest harmony to drink, standing side by side while others transform, dissolving their intentions.

“That one”—as in the *Book of Songs*: “That man”—implies that if he were to return and dwell at home, then superiors and inferiors, elders and juniors, would each find their proper place. Wherever he applied his inquiries, no effort would be required, for harmony would prevail whether at home or in the village. How distant was Yue Xiu’s virtue from Pengyang’s! *Master Chu’s Superficial Observations* notes: Wang Guo spoke of Yijie’s fondness for advancement, his inability to emulate Gong Yuexiu’s conduct, yet both were beloved and esteemed by the King of Chu. Now, Zeyang, with advancement in his heart, sought Yijie’s recommendation. Yijie was weak in virtue but strong in cunning; he did not recognize that the inner spirit is what should be honored, instead becoming externally infatuated with wealth and rank. Without virtue to aid him, he could only consume and diminish. It was like borrowing spring’s warmth to relieve cold—how could it suffice? Or reversing winter’s wind to relieve heat—how could it help? To act contrary to what is fitting and reasonable is to seek without benefit.

The spirit delights in harmony and detests deceit. Human nature is fundamentally good, with no inherent impossibility. As for the spirit, one who attains it within and trusts it firmly can then approve of oneself. Yet Yijie’s esteem for competition was such that he failed to approve of his own spirit. Moreover, the King of Chu was stern and harsh; only flatterers or those of upright virtue could sway him. The paths of conduct, whether good or evil, do not extend beyond these two. Why not abandon evil and pursue good, following Yuexiu’s example? Then, perhaps, one might endure.

Thus, from the sage downward, Shu Yuexiu’s virtue suffices to transform others, all proceeding from non-action. As for offering harmony to drink without words, standing side by side while others transform—only the sage can achieve this. The sage comprehends the subtle and the manifest, encompassing all as one, yet remains unaware of how this is so—it is simply his nature. Returning to the root and moving in accord with heaven, he takes heaven as his teacher. Others then follow and name him as such.

To be anxious in knowledge and to act without respite—how can this endure? If it must cease, what then? One who is born beautiful is given a mirror by others; if not told, he does not know his beauty surpasses others. Whether he knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, his delight remains unceasing, and others’ admiration for him knows no end—this is his nature. The sage’s love for others is such that others bestow a name upon him; if not told, they do not know of his love. Whether he knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, his love for others remains unceasing, and others’ contentment in him knows no end—this, too, is his nature.

*Guo’s Commentary* states: Profoundly penetrating and without limit, all is illuminated, yet one remains unaware of how this is so—what is it if not nature? That which sways sways of itself; that which acts acts of itself. None fail to return to their mandate and take their natural endowment as their teacher—this is not a pursuit of fame to exalt one’s conduct. Following nature in movement, one’s traces are naturally lofty, so others cannot diminish one’s name. To act through knowledge is to be followed by ceaseless anxiety and exhaustion. The mirror is impartial, so others admire it. Yet does the mirror know it is a mirror? It is simply born to reflect; others call it a mirror. If people did not inform one another, none would know their beauty surpasses others. It is like the sage: others bestow a name upon him. His delight arises from being without attachment, regardless of whether one knows or does not know, hears or does not hear. He reflects what comes before him, hence his delight is unceasing. If reflection depended on hearing and knowing, it would sometimes cease. What one’s nature dislikes, how can it endure long? The sage is without love, like a mirror’s function, aiding others—thus others bestow a name upon him. If people did not inform one another, none would know of his love for others. Vast and unconstrained, treating the hundred clans as straw dogs, yet his Way accords with loving others—hence his love is unceasing. If love arose from hearing and knowing, it would sometimes wane; only what nature loves can endure.

*Lü’s Commentary* states: The human heart is entangled in affairs, unaware of what is called “the one body.” Only the sage can comprehend it. Thus, inwardly he does not see himself, outwardly he does not see things—things and self are one. What he embodies is inherently all-encompassing, yet he remains unaware of how this is so—it is confined to his nature and not externally obtained. Returning to the mandate is to return to the root. Swaying and acting are the flourishing of the ten thousand things. Though still and returning to the mandate, this does not prevent swaying and acting. Thus, though he speaks all day, he has not spoken; though he acts all day, he has not acted. All is simply to take heaven as his teacher. Heaven knows what one does not know—how could I claim to know myself as a sage? Others merely follow and name me as such.

To be without knowledge is to be without care. The multitude fret over knowledge, yet their conduct races like a gallop—how soon it comes to a halt! How then may one attain this state?

Those born with beauty are shown a mirror and told of it, and only then do they know their beauty surpasses others. Whether they know or do not know, hear or do not hear, their joy remains unceasing. Others’ admiration for them also never ends, for it arises from their nature.

The sage’s love for others is such that only when others name and tell him of it does he know he loves them. Whether he knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, his love for others never ceases. Others find rest in it, and this too never ends, for it arises from his nature—unaffected by whether he knows or does not know, hears or does not hear.

*Yidu’s Commentary:*
The sage, freed from all bonds, penetrates the great Dao, merging into a single whole without inner or outer. He does not know why it is so, yet it is so—this is his nature. Returning to the mandate is stillness; swaying is activity. Both take heaven as their teacher.

The sage does not seek a name; the world bestows it upon him. To fret over the obscurity of knowledge is to delight in employing it. Yet knowledge reaches its limit, and so one’s conduct soon halts. How then may one attain the Dao?

A mirror is without feeling toward others; people love it for distinguishing beauty from ugliness. Whether they know or do not know, hear or do not hear, their delight in it never ends. If the mirror possessed knowledge and perception like human preferences, its reflection would not endure, nor would people’s admiration for it. The mirror’s appeal lies in its lack of feeling; people’s fondness for it arises from their nature, and so it never ends.

A mirror reflects but does not speak; without being told, one would not know its reflection surpasses others. The sage’s love for others is likewise without feeling, and without being named, others would not know his love. If his love depended on hearing and knowing, it would cease in time. Yet people’s comfort in the sage’s kindness never ends—this too is nature.

*Bixu’s Commentary:*
To untangle entanglements is not to be ensnared by things. All-embracing unity leaves nothing outside the self. To know why it is so is to distance oneself from nature. Though stillness and motion differ, both follow nature as their teacher. The sage has no name; people, moved by his transformation, name him as such.

With a life of finite span, to fret over boundless knowledge is to say: “There is never enough time.” Yet when one wishes to stop but cannot proceed further, what is to be done? When one has a beautiful countenance, others show it in a mirror so they may know its beauty surpasses others. Whether they know or do not know, hear or do not hear, their delight in it never ends. And others’ admiration for beauty never ceases—this too is nature. The sage’s love for others never ends, and others’ comfort in it never ends—this too is nature.

*Yanzhai’s Oral Teachings:*
“Entanglement” refers to the ceaseless interplay of yin and yang, the unending cycle of cause and effect. The sage grasps the principle of yin-yang transformation, exhausts the subtleties of coarse and fine, and follows nature without knowing why. Whether in action or stillness, all returns to the mandate of heaven, with nature as its guide.

To fret over knowledge is to be burdened by private concerns, endlessly calculating. How much can truly be accomplished? Thus it is said: “One’s conduct soon halts.” If I intend to act but am constrained by fate, what is to be done? Hence it is said: “How soon it comes to a stop.” Here, “time” means fate. The root of all cessation lies in knowledge. If one knew what one does not know, there would be no care.

Beauty arises from ugliness; without being shown ugliness, one would not know beauty. The distinction between beauty and ugliness gives rise to care. Thus, whether one knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, delight in beauty never ends. If I forget beauty and ugliness and remain unmoved by things, others’ fondness for me will also never end. This is the principle of nature.

“Entanglement” refers to worldly burdens that bind one, preventing freedom—all stemming from the opposition of self and things. Only the sage can penetrate this with the Dao, exhausting the principles of things and returning to unity, yet not knowing why. This is because he meets them with his nature, not with the mind of self and other. What difference is there?

Thus, in moments of stillness, there is activity; in activity, one does not depart from the Dao of returning to the mandate. Motion and stillness are mutually rooted. This reveals that yin and yang have no principle of exhaustion—all take nature as their teacher, not arising from deliberate intent or self-directed purpose.

When one reaches the realm of great transformation, people name him as such. The sage does not make himself a sage; this is the meaning of “great virtue must attain its name.” The world frets over insufficient knowledge, and their conduct soon halts. To seek fame through knowledge and race without rest—what is to be done?

The analogy is this: people know beauty through a mirror, but without being told, they would not know. The mirror’s reflection is unceasing, and people’s delight in it is also unceasing. The sage’s love for others is the same—people name it as such. Thus, his love and others’ comfort in it never end, all arising from the spontaneity of nature, each resting in what is fitting.

*End of the Eighty-Second Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei
*Beginning of the Eighty-Third Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin on "Ze Yang," the Second Chapter

Gazing upon one’s former state and former capital, one feels unbounded joy. Even if hills and woods have grown dense, entering them, one still recognizes nine parts in ten—how much more so when seeing what one has seen and hearing what one has heard! This is like a towering terrace suspended above a throng of questions.

Ran Xiangshi grasped the center of the ring and followed completion, moving with things without end or beginning, without measure or time. One who daily transforms with things is the one who does not transform—why cling to this? To model oneself on Heaven yet fail to do so, to be swept along with things—how can one make this one’s affair?

The sage never begins with Heaven, never begins with man, never begins with a beginning, never begins with things. He moves with the world without ceasing, his conduct complete yet not stagnant—how does he achieve such harmony?

Tang entrusted governance to his officials, the Gatekeeper Deng Dan and others, following their guidance without constraint, attaining the spontaneity of completion. He oversaw their names; in those names lay the excess of law, achieving a dual vision.

Confucius, in exhausting thought, served as their guide. The Lord of Rong Cheng said: "Remove days, and there are no years; remove inner and outer, and there is no space."

Guo’s commentary: To recover what was old still brings joy—how much more to recover one’s nature? To see what one has seen and hear what one has heard still brings joy—how much more to embody its essence and employ its nature! What the multitude practices, though perilous, they perform with ease—how much more so the sage, who knows no peril?

Ran Xiangshi, an ancient sage-king, dwelled in emptiness and followed things, allowing them to complete themselves. With things, he had no end or beginning, suddenly moving together with them, daily transforming with them—thus he was ever without self yet ever unchanging. Why not try to harmonize what one does?

Only by having no teacher can one truly model oneself on Heaven. Yet even modeling on Heaven does not escape being swept along—how can this suffice as an affair? Modeling on Heaven still falls short of what is needed—how much more so if one does not model at all? One must reach the point where Heaven and things are utterly absent before achieving dark union.

Thus, Tang entrusted matters to his hundred officials without interference, allowing them to gather naturally, not confining them, and to disperse naturally, not dissolving them. The ranks of the Master of Chariots and the like could follow the self-completion of things, and Tang attained this—thus his name was lent to the achievements of things, not resting in himself.

Names and laws are traces of what has passed, not the fitting measure. Thus, one who is effortlessly without intent entrusts governance to the many officials, and his name and traces appear in them. Confucius said: "What thought, what worry has the world? Thought is already exhausted." If even the slightest thought remains, how can one attain stillness and motionlessness, responding endlessly to assist the spontaneity of the myriad things?

Now, the reason years exist and days are preserved is because of life and death. If there were no life and death, the reckoning of years and days would vanish.

Lü’s commentary: Gazing upon one’s former state brings joy—this is human nature. Even if hills and woods have grown dense, one still feels joy—this is merely not forgetting one’s roots. How much more so when what one sees and hears has endured with Heaven and Earth, making one’s state and capital ancient indeed! To see and hear it all as if from a towering terrace suspended above a throng of questions—nothing escapes one’s view. How boundless is this joy!

"Throng of questions" refers to places without people. The "center of the ring" is ceaseless movement without beginning or end, following completion without action—thus there is no beginning or end, no measure of time. "Measure" refers to calculation. One who transforms with things is the one who does not transform—why not abandon this? If one’s conduct is always without measure and yet comes to a halt, to seek to model on Heaven yet fail is to be swept along with things—this is all one’s affair.

The sage never begins with Heaven, man, beginning, or things. He moves together without ceasing, complete yet not stagnant—this is what is meant by "returning to the mandate and stirring to action," the true way to model on Heaven, and thus he achieves harmony.

Tang attained the Master of Chariots, who governs regulation; the Gatekeeper, who rectifies entry; and Deng Dan, who perfects the cultivation of constancy. The one who governs regulation is the heart; the one who rectifies entry is the Dao. Constancy is the enduring nature of the Dao. All these model themselves on Heaven.

Only by following the teacher without being confined by things and attaining spontaneity of completion can one oversee their names. In those names lies the excess of law, achieving a dual vision. With spontaneity of completion, the names of the Master of Chariots and others follow the completion of one’s heart—these are not names of those who act with intent. Their essence is the Dao; their excess is the law. Seeing the origin of names, one knows the origin of laws—this is the dual vision. Though one has vision, not knowing that the world never begins with thought and worry is still not exhaustive—thus Confucius exhausted thought.

"Serving as their guide" does not mean Confucius guided Tang. With spontaneity of completion, what Ran Xiangshi attained shows that the names of the Master of Chariots and others are allegories. "Remove days, and there are no years"—then one does not know time. "Remove inner and outer, and there is no space"—then one does not know the cosmos. Only one who exhausts thought can attain this.

Yi Du’s commentary: Human nature pursues things, becoming lost and not returning—like one who has left the capital for a long time, gazing upon it brings unbounded joy. Entering the capital, recognizing nine parts in ten, one’s delight is still evident—how much more so when seeing what one has seen and hearing what one has heard! One’s true nature is like hills and woods. Entering them is like returning to the root. Recognizing nine parts in ten is not yet fully returning; seeing what one has seen and hearing what one has heard is the return complete. The joy of seeing one’s nature is like the joy of seeing one’s former capital.

Even a lofty, perilous terrace, when one is accustomed to climbing it, feels as if at ease—how much more so one who attains true nature! Ran Xiangshi, a sage-king of the Three Sovereigns and above, grasped the principle of true emptiness, ceaselessly moving and following the myriad things to complete the Dao. Without beginning or end, without measure of time, he transformed with things. One who transforms with things is the one who does not transform; one who does not transform is able to transform all transformations.

Those in the world who act—why do they not align their actions and return to spontaneity, so that true nature may be attained? Yet those who set their minds on following Heaven cannot attain it—how much less those who are swept along with things and do not return? Before there was Heaven or man, Heaven and man existed of themselves; before there was a beginning or things, the beginning of things arose from the self. Moving through the world, one bends and stretches without ceasing; in fulfilling all conduct, one maintains humility without excess, merging with principle as if it were inevitable—how could it be otherwise?

*Si Yu* was an official title of the gatekeeper. *Deng Da* was a system of regulations, meaning that one who ascends the *Deng Da* Way may serve as a teacher to others. The sage follows teachers but is not confined by them, simply allowing things to be natural—this is like becoming an infant with one who is an infant. Tang obtained these three men as his tutors, following them without constraint, complying with them to complete his Way. Tang then reversed the roles to oversee their titles, and those three men left no traces in the world!

Here, the laws of Ying and Fa were both manifested in Tang. Though Tang was a sage who fulfilled the human Way, the laws of his time were not yet complete. By the time of Confucius, the world’s transformations were fully realized, so he exhausted his thoughts to establish complete laws—thus becoming Tang’s tutor in turn.

*Bi Xu’s Commentary*: A man weakened by mourning gazes toward his homeland and hears its familiar sounds; though the woods and houses are overgrown and ruined, nine parts in ten lost, he still feels joy—how much more so one who sees without losing sight, hears without losing hearing, and abides in wondrous, serene being! The loftiness and clarity of the Great Dao conceal nothing, like erecting a towering terrace in a scenic place or hanging bells and drums in the open wilds, startling people’s ears and eyes to awaken them.

*Zhong Jian* (read as *jian*), meaning the open wilds. The center of the ring is empty, so it can revolve with things. Because it adapts to what arises, it cannot be fixed by any beginning, end, or measure of time. One who attains the Way of the ring’s center merges with things without boundary. Though transformations shift daily, the original source remains serene—what room is there for concern over transformation or its absence? Because it never grasps, it also never abandons; to follow Heaven without intent is truly to follow Heaven. If one is weary and buried in the dust, what then?

One who would follow Heaven must forget human affairs; one who is swept along must forget the wondrous source. Before there was Heaven, human affairs were not abandoned; before there were things, the wondrous source suffered no loss. Merging with things without betraying the real, treading all conduct without drowning in the dust—if one borrows falsity in entanglement, how can this be so? In ancient times, Tang’s worthy ministers *Si Zhu* and *Lin Yu* served as his tutors, so he followed them without constraint. Constraint is the extreme of reliance, which is why the gatekeeper *Deng Da* achieved the merit of following things to their spontaneous completion and presided over their names.

The names of laws are hard to forget in governance—how much more so when the proper name and the beneficial law are both clearly manifested? Moreover, when all officials oversee their duties, each exhausts their thoughts to assist, and in exhausting thoughts, there are no thoughts left—thus they may serve as tutors. Without days, there are no years; without beginning or end, there is no constraint. Without inner or outer, life and death follow what arises. This is the Way of penetrating entanglement and encompassing the whole as one.

*Yuan Qi Kou Yi*: One who returns to his homeland after long travel must feel a deep sense of relief. Entering it, the grass and trees intertwine, and though nine parts in ten are lost compared to the past, he still feels relief—how much more so when seeking the Dao and suddenly awakening, seeing what he has always seen, hearing what he has always heard! These are all things originally possessed—how could one not rejoice?

The terrace is the highest place. *Xuan* means to display music. *Zhong* means many. *Jian* is read in the falling tone, like the sound of *sheng* and *yue* playing together. Standing in the highest place, hearing the interwoven music, one can stir the ears and eyes of the world—how much more so when the sage, with the principle of emptiness and spontaneity, delights in the myriad things! How lofty is his self-abiding!

The center of the ring is a metaphor for supreme emptiness, without beginning or end, like the One. *Ji Shi* means past and present. *Ji* refers to the changes of time. "Daily transforming with things" means renewing with things each day, yet what I attain is the one that does not transform. Why do people not abandon old habits and return to the supreme Dao? Taking spontaneity as the law, without the name of "law of spontaneity," is nothing more than complying with things. If one has intent in acting, what can be done?

Man acts, but Heaven does not act. Not only are there no traces of action, but even the non-acting is absent—thus it is said, "There was never a beginning of Heaven, never a beginning of man." Things are traces. The beginning of no-things is the absence of traces. Not only is there no trace of things, but even the absence of traces is absent—thus it is said, "There was never a beginning, never a beginning of things."

Moving through the world, one is the same as others, with no affairs abandoned or neglected; all conduct is fully equipped, without attachment to any one thing. *Xu* is like *lao xu* in the *Qi Wu Lun*, meaning to be mired and drowned. Merging with the Dao, one does not seek to align—seeking alignment, one cannot attain it!

In ancient times, Tang took Yi Yin as his teacher but was not confined by him, attaining the principle of the completion of the myriad things and following it. He abided in non-action, allowing Yin to preside over names. Tang was non-active and nameless, while Yin was active and named. This name existed in the world as surplus law. *Liang Jian* ("two manifestations") means that body and name were divided, failing to attain their blended oneness.

Yi Yin’s role was not extraordinary in itself. Confucius admired him and exhausted his thoughts to assist the world, also desiring to do as Yi Yin had done—this remark is a subtle criticism. *Rong Cheng Shi*, an ancient sage, combined three hundred and sixty days to make a year, but when counting days one by one, they are called days, not years—this is like Laozi’s saying about counting carts without a cart.

External names arise from the internal; without the internal, there is no external.

To illustrate the principle of naturalness: Man’s true nature is originally whole, but over time, its inner integrity wanes as external perceptions and knowledge lead it astray. Gradually, the inner self drifts as far as one who leaves the old capital for a distant land, adrift in a foreign land. Yet when an enlightened teacher awakens him, how could he not gaze toward his homeland with longing? Even if nine-tenths of the timber in a ruined mound has rotted away, he would still rejoice in its remnants—how much more when he sees what he once saw and hears what he once heard? These arise from the original state of his nature, like standing atop a high tower amidst a crowd, seeing all without obstruction.

In ancient times, Ran Xiangshi attained the Dao of emptiness and penetration. In his governance, he followed things to their completion, his nature harmonizing with them. Without beginning or end, he forgot the greatness of transformation. Without the passage of moments, he forgot the smallness of transformation. Great and small, long and short—all merged into one. What attachment could there be to the present moment? One who daily transforms with things finds the former flame is not the latter. One who does not transform remains the same self today as before—when has it ever departed?

To seek the Way of naturalness while deliberately pursuing things is to depart from naturalness. How could such affairs ever succeed? The sage forgets Heaven and forgets man, and thus can act as Heaven and act as man. He forgets beginnings and forgets things, and thus can initiate and can respond to things. Moving in step with the world without decline, he follows things as they are, without loss. His actions are complete yet never excessive, encompassing all things without overreaching. His movements accord with the Dao—how could this be otherwise?

Tang, having three ministers as his tutors, learned from their teaching of non-action, unconfined by the techniques of governance. The governance of worthy ministers serves to restrain the world and nurture the people, and their way of exalting the ruler and securing peace lies solely in the Dao—skills and abilities play no part. This again depends on the ruler’s acceptance or rejection, where the pivot of order and chaos, fortune and misfortune, becomes apparent.

Tang attained the Dao of following things and allowing them to reach completion, entrusting his ministers with the names of governance. Though the achievement was accomplished by the three, the name was attributed to Tang. Such names are merely surplus law, not Tang’s true essence. The "two manifestations" refer to ruler and minister mutually supporting one another to perfect the Way of governance. Their traces became manifest in the world, so later Confucius exhausted his thoughts to perfect the methods of ordering the world. Though he did not live in Tang’s time, he too served as a tutor. As astronomers accumulate days to form a year, and emperors accumulate knowledge to become sages, Tang could not have perfected his Way of governance without the three ministers as tutors. Without Tang and the three ministers laying the foundation, Confucius could not have achieved it alone—just as inner and outer cannot exist without each other.

When the Dao is perfected and virtue complete, its beneficence flows boundlessly. In the vast harmony of all things, the people forget the ruler’s power, and sagely wisdom transforms with them—this is the meaning of "counting days without a year." Where then is the division between inner and outer?

The scriptural passage’s difficulty in interpretation likely lies in the character *he* (合), which should be read in connection with the preceding text.

Wei Ying made a covenant with Lord Mou of Tian, but Lord Mou of Tian betrayed it. Wei Ying, enraged, was about to send an assassin, when Xishou, hearing of it, found it shameful and said: "You are a lord of ten thousand chariots, yet you would resort to the vengeance of a commoner! I, Yan, request two hundred thousand armored troops to attack him for you, capturing his people, seizing his cattle and horses, and causing his lord’s back to break out in boils from inner heat. Then we will take his state. When Ji flees, we will strike his back and break his spine."

Ji Zi, hearing of this, found it shameful and said: "To build a city wall of ten *ren* in height—once the wall of ten *ren* is completed, it is then torn down—this is the toil that convict laborers lament. Now, for seven years, no war has arisen; this is the foundation of the Three Dynasties. Yan is a disturber of order; he must not be heeded."

Hua Zi, hearing of it, deemed it disgraceful and said: "Those who speak well of attacking Qi are disturbers of order. Those who speak well of not attacking Qi are also disturbers of order. Those who say that both attacking and not attacking are the words of disturbers of order are themselves disturbers of order."

The lord said: "Then what should be done?"
He replied: "My lord, seek only the Way."

Huizi, hearing of this, went to see Dai Jinren. Dai Jinren said: "There is a creature called the snail—do you know of it?"
The lord said: "Yes."
Dai Jinren continued: "On the left horn of the snail is a state called Chushi, and on the right horn is a state called Manshi. At times, they contend over territory and wage war, leaving tens of thousands of corpses strewn upon the field. The pursuit of the routed army lasts fifteen days before they return."
The lord said: "Alas! Are these empty words?"
Dai Jinren replied: "I beg to make them real for you."

The lord asked: "Do you suppose the four directions and the realms above and below have limits?"
He replied: "They are without limit."
Dai Jinren said: "To know that the mind roams in the boundless, yet to return and dwell in the lands of common access—does it not seem as if they exist or do not exist?"
The lord said: "So it is."
Dai Jinren continued: "Within the lands of common access lies Wei; within Wei lies Liang; within Liang lies the king. Does the king differ from the Manshi?"
The lord said: "There is no difference."

The guest departed, and the lord sat in silent abstraction, as if something had been lost.

Huizi entered and was received. The lord said: "This guest is a great man—even a sage cannot compare to him."
Huizi replied: "When one blows through a pipe, there is a resonant sound; when one blows across the hilt of a sword, there is but a faint whisper. Yao and Shun are those whom men praise, yet to speak of Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren is like that faint whisper."

*(Guo's annotation: The snail is most minute, yet bears two horns. If one truly knows that what is contested is as trifling as this, then there would be no contention in the world. The lands of common access refer to what lies within the four seas. Though one takes the four seas as vast, when measured against the boundless, they seem as if they exist or do not exist. The king and the Manshi are both finite things; being finite, whether great or small, they cannot be reckoned against the boundless. Even heaven and earth, though they dwell within the boundless, are as nothing—how much more so Wei within the lands of common access, Liang within Wei, and the king within Liang? What is there to contend over? The lord sat in silent abstraction, grieving that what was contested was so trifling. The sound of blowing through a pipe is audible; the sound of blowing across a sword’s hilt is scarcely heard.)*

*(Lü's annotation: No fault is greater than desire. Those who speak well of attacking Qi see profit as desirable and are thus disturbers of order. Those who speak well of not attacking see goodness as desirable and are likewise disturbers of order. Those who say that both attacking and not attacking are the words of disturbers of order are themselves not free from partial views and are thus disturbers of order. Only by seeking the Way does one avoid clinging to one-sided views, and thus the source of disorder is stilled. If one’s mind roams in the boundless, then the lands of common access in the four directions and the realms above and below—whether Wei or Liang—are all but projections of one’s own mind. Not only is there no difference between the king and the Chushi and Manshi, but even the lands of common access, Wei, Liang, Chushi, and Manshi are without distinction. Knowing this, then nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, and Mount Tai is small. The king realized that the source of contention arises from what does not truly exist, and so he sat in silent abstraction, as if something had been lost. The divine man, the sage, and the great man are not inherently superior or inferior—it is only the perspective from which they are spoken that differs. Blowing through a pipe produces a sound because it has a receptacle; blowing across a sword’s hilt produces no sound because it has no receptacle.)*

*(Yi Du’s annotation: Dai Jinren was a man of Liang who embraced the Way. The lands of common access refer to where boats and carriages travel. The analogy of the snail’s horns and the Chushi and Manshi is a critique of the warlike rulers of the time. The lord of Wei took it as empty words, but when applied to human affairs, its truth became evident. Does the mind’s intent in the four directions and the realms above and below have limits? To know that the mind roams in the boundless yet returns to dwell in the lands of common access—this is to speak of dwelling in a finite place. Within the lands of common access lies Wei; within Wei lies Liang; within Liang lies the king. The closer one draws, the smaller it becomes, until the king’s own person is no different from the Chushi and Manshi on the snail’s horns. From this perspective, all things in the world with form are never without encumbrance—how much more so when it comes to contending over states and territory? The sound of blowing through a pipe is loud; the sound of blowing across a sword’s hilt is faint. To speak of Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren is scarcely heard.)*

*(Bi Xu’s annotation: When the king’s armies march, they do so with clear purpose and righteous conduct. If they were to make plunder their aim, provoking resentment and rebellion that uproots a state, such a thing has never been heard of. Now, to raise arms over a petty grievance and invade a neighboring state is surely the act of a disturber of order. Jizi’s counsel against attacking would indulge the arrogance of neighboring states and is likewise a disturbance. Huazi’s claim that both views are those of disturbers of order was meant to elevate men of the Way and urge remonstrance. What is called ‘seeking the Way’ is simply to cultivate virtue and refrain from contention. Huizi sought an audience with Jinren and presented this analogy to dispel the lord’s misgivings. The snail’s horns illustrate how minute the matter is—contention between two states does not extend beyond a single shell. Fifteen days represent the cycle of qi, for the qi of joy and anger returns and repeats. Heaven and earth are lodged in the great void like a pebble in Mount Tai; the lands of common access are lodged in the cosmos like a grain of millet in a granary. Wei dwells within the lands of common access like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body—how much more so Liang within Wei, and the king within Liang? Are they not like the Chushi and Manshi on the snail’s horns? Now, the contention between Qi and Wei—does it differ from the war between the Chushi and Manshi? The great man transcends the six directions and follows nature; the sage dwells within the world and upholds its laws. Blowing through a pipe produces a resonant sound; blowing across a sword’s hilt passes by with a whisper. This is like the governance of Yao and Shun, which men praise—yet when measured by the Way, it is scarcely heard. How much less so the invasion of states and the plunder of their people?)*

*(Yongzhai’s annotation: For seven years, no war arose—this was the great achievement of the lord of Wei. Xishou’s counsel to use force was like tearing down a city already built, bringing suffering to the laborers. Huazi’s words, with their focus on ‘attacking,’ still harbored partiality. Thus, all three were disturbers of order. Only by knowing the Way does one cease to speak of war. The analogy of the snail’s horns is initially empty, but the explanation below makes it real. The boundless refers to the great void. The lands of common access refer to the central states. Viewed from the great void, the central states are most minute; viewed from the central states, Wei is small; viewed from Wei, Liang is smaller still; and within Liang, the king’s person is ever more minute. Seen from the great void, the king’s person is no different from the Chushi and Manshi on the snail’s horns. Sitting in silent abstraction, as if something had been lost, he realized that what was contested was not worth contending over. Blowing through a pipe produces sound because it has an opening; blowing across a sword’s hilt produces no sound—before a man of the Way, to speak of benevolence and righteousness is to have no place for words.)*

The Xishou was a military officer’s title; at the time, Gongsun Yan held this post and sought to deploy troops to attack Qi, plundering the people and exhausting the state, relying on strength and belittling the enemy—truly a man of disorder. Jizi claimed that long abstention from war was the foundation of the king’s rule, his aim being to pacify the people and stabilize the state—how could he be called a man of disorder? Yet Huazi wished to advance his later argument, so he first unsettled the mind of the King of Wei, awaiting his urgent inquiry before revealing the marvel. The phrase “seek the unity of its Way” refers to the earlier words of the Xishou as not being the Way. Jizi wished to halt the war but lacked the Way; to say both were wrong was to have no means of resolving the matter, and thus both were inevitably men of disorder. Huizi requested an audience with Dai Jinren, for this was seeking the Way rightly. The two states on the snail’s horns illustrate how trivial was the dispute between Qi and Wei—this is detailed in the various commentaries and need not be repeated here. Blowing through a pipe produces sound, an analogy for the common people’s praise of Yao and Shun. To speak of Yao and Shun before a man of the Way is like blowing across a sword’s hilt—no sound emerges. To discuss the invasion of a state before Huazi is likewise so.

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin on "Ze Yang, Third Chapter"

When Confucius traveled to Chu, he lodged at the wine-seller’s house on Ant Mound. There, a neighbor—a husband and wife with their servants—ascended to the roof’s ridge. Zilu asked, “What are these angular figures doing?” Confucius replied, “They are the servants of a sage, burying themselves among the people, concealing themselves at the margins. Their reputation fades, yet their aspiration knows no bounds. Though their mouths speak, their hearts never truly speak. They go along with the world yet disdain to accompany it in their hearts. These are men submerged on dry land—is this not Yiliao of Shinan?”

Zilu requested to summon them. Confucius said, “Enough! He knows I am aware of him, knows I am bound for Chu, and takes me for one who will surely persuade the King of Chu to summon him. He would then regard me as a flatterer. If that were so, he would feel shame even to hear a flatterer’s words—how much more to meet him in person? What use would it be to seek him out?”

Zilu went to look, but their house was empty.

Guo’s commentary: “Burying themselves among the people” means living as one with them. “Concealing themselves at the margins” means neither advancing into glory nor retreating into withered obscurity. “Their reputation fades” means they diminish their fame. “Their aspiration knows no bounds” means they plan for long life. What they say are worldly words, yet their hearts differ from the world. They are recluses among men, like those submerged where no water flows. “Aware” means “clear.” “What use would it be to seek him out?” means it is better to leave him and follow his aspiration. “Their house was empty” means he had indeed fled.

Lü’s commentary: The couple ascended to the roof’s ridge upon Confucius’s arrival, showing they would not engage with him and were preparing to withdraw to higher ground. “Servants of a sage” means those who possess sagely virtue yet serve. “Burying themselves among the people” means they perform no visible deeds. “Concealing themselves at the margins” means they do not dwell in the central and upright virtue. “Their reputation fades yet their aspiration knows no bounds” means they withdraw and hide in secrecy, roaming beyond the world’s bounds. “Though their mouths speak, their hearts never truly speak” means they wish to remain silent yet cannot. “They go along with the world yet disdain to accompany it” means they are about to flee the world. To wander among men with sagely virtue yet remain unknown is like being submerged on dry land. From Confucius’s perspective of advancement, busying himself with the world’s affairs seems like flattery. Yet if all were like Yiliao, who among the common people would be saved? The Way of the sage would fall to the ground and be lost.

Formerly, Weisheng Mu once called Confucius a flatterer, to which Confucius replied that he dared not be. Now, regarding Yiliao, he calls himself a flatterer to show that what he values lies here, while his busyness is not by choice.

Yi Du’s commentary: Ant Mound is a place name. The wine-seller’s family ascended to the roof’s ridge to watch. “Angular” describes their multitude. “Burying themselves among the people” means living as one with them. “Concealing themselves at the margins” means they do not appear at the border. “Their reputation fades” means they diminish their fame. “Their aspiration knows no bounds” means their aspiration is set upon the Way. They have no intention to speak but merely respond to things; their hearts differ from the world, though outwardly they are the same as others. The sage’s hiddenness in heaven is like being submerged on dry land, akin to those who conceal themselves in the marketplace. Zhuangzi uses Confucius and Yiliao in a parable to critique the accounts of sages. “Their house was empty” means he was nowhere to be found. Here, one sees how the Master rests as one with the people, while Yiliao departs from men to enter the realm of heaven.

Bi Xu’s commentary: “Ascended to the roof’s ridge” means they climbed the roof beams to observe Confucius. Performing the tasks of a servant, they served the sage—like Gengsang Chu attending Lao Dan, burying themselves among the people, or Liezi living in the Zheng gardens, unknown to all. “Concealing themselves at the margins” is like Chang Ju and Jie Ni plowing in obscurity at the field’s edge.

Thus, when sounds fade, the will flows free; when words emerge, the heart forgets—scorning to dwell with the world, submerged on dry land as if sunk beneath the waves. Confucius gauged that Yiliao would not appear before him, just as Yan Xi felt shame at being seen by Xu You. "Why do you still remain here?"—meaning, how could you linger in such a place?

*Yanzhai Oral Exegesis*:
"Ridge" refers to the roof beam. "Servant" means disciple. "Bury" means to conceal. "Margin" means neighbor. "Conceal" means to dwell beside others without being known. "Sounds fade" means to flee from fame. "Submerged on dry land" is a metaphor for hiding in the marketplace. "Notices" means to recognize. "Flattery" means excessive speech. "Why do you still remain?" means to depart without lingering.

In ancient times, customs were simple and honest; people lived from birth to death without visiting one another, each content in their allotted place, inwardly sufficient and seeking nothing from without. Now, the Master hurries about on his missions, wishing to transform the world with benevolence and righteousness, bending and twisting rites and music—losing the serenity and joy of his nature. Those gentlemen of hidden virtue and concealed brilliance rightly flee to the heights, fearing only that their departure is not swift enough. Yet the sage loves others without cease, regardless of his own success or failure, ever holding the salvation of all under heaven in his heart. He cannot be spoken of in the same breath as those who, submerged on dry land, cultivate only their own goodness.

The Master knew that though they served the sage as attendants, they had not yet ascended to the inner sanctum—these were men who fled fame to follow their will, like the market-south hermit Xiong Yiliao. The sage’s knowledge of others was so precise that when Zilu wished to summon them, the Master knew they would not come. "Their house was empty"—just as the *Analects* says: he sent Zilu back to see them, but by the time he arrived, they had already gone. Here, one sees all the more clearly the Master’s foresight, while those who submerge themselves on dry land to cultivate only their own goodness reveal the narrowness of their way of life. Each follows their own inclinations and preferences, nothing more.

The border warden of Changwu asked Zilao: "In governing, do not be reckless; in ordering the people, do not be careless. Once, when I planted grain, I plowed recklessly, and the harvest repaid me in kind; I weeded carelessly, and the harvest repaid me in kind. The next year, I changed my methods, plowing deeply and tending the soil thoroughly—my grain flourished and multiplied, and I had my fill for the whole year."

When Zhuangzi heard this, he said: "Nowadays, those who cultivate their bodies and order their minds often resemble what the border warden described. They flee from heaven, depart from their nature, extinguish their emotions, and lose their spirit, all to follow the crowd. Thus, those who treat their nature recklessly—desires and aversions sprout like weeds, choking the shoots of our form, then grasping at our nature. They burst forth in indiscriminate eruptions, giving rise to abscesses, scabies, paralysis, and internal heat that scorches the marrow."

Guo’s commentary:
"Reckless and careless" means acting lightly and neglecting details, not fulfilling one’s proper role. To fulfill one’s role completely is the perfection of non-action. Fleeing, departing, extinguishing, and losing—all stem from following the crowd. If each were taken to its extreme, where would there be any rest? Weeds harm millet and sorghum; desires and aversions injure the true nature. When the form is overgrown, the spirit and qi are harmed, and desires and aversions lead the nature astray, never reaching what is fitting. This is the repayment for recklessness.

Lü’s commentary:
To practice the Dao is to diminish daily until one reaches non-action—this is how one cultivates the body and orders the mind. Yet to flee from heaven, depart from one’s nature, extinguish the spirit, and lose the emotions, following the crowd without knowing when to stop—this is the height of recklessness! When things are stable, they are easy to maintain; when signs have not yet appeared, they are easy to plan for. Within, desires and aversions sprout like reeds; without, they grow like rushes. They prop up our form and grasp at our nature—heavenly principle is extinguished! At such a time, can one hope to order them? From "bursting forth in indiscriminate eruptions" onward, all describe how desires and aversions become calamities, seizing what is true.

Yidu’s commentary:
In governing the people, to act recklessly and carelessly is to be negligent and achieve nothing. The border warden drew the same lesson from his own farming. The next year, he changed his methods, plowing deeply and tending the soil thoroughly—his grain flourished, and he had his fill for the whole year. The more effort he put in, the greater the reward. Cultivating the body and ordering the mind is no different. To flee from heaven is to escape one’s natural state; thus, one departs from their nature, extinguishes their emotions, and loses their spirit to follow the crowd—this is to move toward death. Weeds, when they first sprout, support the growth of the shoots. But when they grow rampant, they harm the seedlings. When the passions of desire and aversion first stir, the form also grows and flourishes. But when they blaze unchecked, they harm the nature. Therefore, one must restrain them at the first sprouting; otherwise, they will grasp at our nature. When the nature is lost and desires blaze, essence and qi leak and erupt without restraint, giving rise to abscesses, scabies, paralysis, and the disease of internal heat scorching the marrow—only ending when the spirit departs and the form decays. This is the repayment for recklessly cultivating the nature. "Scorching the marrow" refers to the disease of turbid qi.

*Yanzhai Oral Exegesis*:
The border warden used farming to illustrate governance; Zhuangzi then used it to illustrate learning—Su Shi’s *Discourse on Farming* follows this model. "Changed methods" means altering one’s farming techniques. The nature of likes and dislikes is like weeds—this is the meaning of "thatching the heart." When the nature is obstructed, desires grow daily, like weeds sprouting and filling the body, until the whole person is consumed by human desires. When human desires prop up the form, one loses the principle of naturalness, uprooting the true nature and extinguishing heavenly principle. When the nature is lost, the qi also falls ill. Some suffer from bursting forth, others from leaking eruptions—without restraint, any contact breeds disease. This passage warns that indulging desires will surely destroy the body.

"Changed methods" was formerly read with a falling tone, referring to farming techniques. Sima read it as a level tone, meaning to change one’s farming methods so they no longer matched others’. Another interpretation: to change the farming methods of the state of Qi.

Bi Xu cited the *Shuowen*: "When grain and wheat put forth ears, if the tops are level, it is called *qi*."

Examining the meaning of the classic in detail, the falling tone is correct, aligning with "allotment" to denote limits and measures. Those who act recklessly do not fully observe the proper measures of plowing and weeding, so their harvests are likewise reckless. Now, changing the grain to flourish yet neglecting nourishment—this serves as a fitting metaphor for cultivating the body and ordering the mind. The human mind and heavenly nature do not transgress the bounds of naturalness; only by fleeing from naturalness does one depart from true nature, leading to the extinction of emotions and the dissipation of spirit without awareness, all drowned in the ways of the multitude.

The harm of desires and aversions to nature is no different from the harm of reeds to seedlings. "Reeds" here refer to the initial growth of *ren* reeds, which at first support the seedlings in equal growth but ultimately overgrow and harm them. Desires and aversions uproot nature and lose the true, causing the body to burst or leak, turning every encounter into illness, inevitably leading to gradual exhaustion. This is the retribution for reckless cultivation of the body. How can one not take heed?

Xiang Ju studied under Lao Cong, saying, "I wish to travel the world." Lao Cong replied, "Enough! The world is as it is." He asked again. Lao Cong said, "Where will you begin?" He replied, "I will begin in Qi." Arriving in Qi, he saw a condemned man and pushed through the crowd to reach him, removing his court robe to cover the man. Wailing to heaven, he cried, "You! You! The world has great calamities, and you alone have encountered them first. They say: Do not steal! Do not kill! Yet honor and disgrace arise, and only then do people see what ails them; wealth and goods accumulate, and only then do they see what they contend over. Now, by establishing what ails people and amassing what they contend over, exhausting their bodies without respite, how can one avoid reaching this point?

The rulers of old held that gains belonged to the people and losses to themselves; that uprightness belonged to the people and crookedness to themselves. Thus, if even one person lost their proper form, they would withdraw and take responsibility. Now, it is not so: they conceal their actions to fool the ignorant, magnify difficulties to blame the fearful, impose heavy burdens to punish the incapable, and distance their reach to evade punishment. When the people know their strength is exhausted, they resort to deceit to continue, and with deceit emerging daily, how can scholars and commoners not also resort to deceit?

When strength is insufficient, they feign; when knowledge is lacking, they deceive; when wealth is wanting, they steal. To whom can the blame for theft and robbery be assigned? Guo’s commentary: "Great calamities" refer to the matters below. Once great calamities exist, even if one warns against them, how can they be avoided? Each seeks their own gain, so honor and disgrace vanish; with gains and losses in disarray, honor and disgrace arise, and boasting and strife follow. Racing between boasting and strife—what is this if not illness? If one takes contentment as wealth, what would there be to contend over?

When superiors have preferences, inferiors cannot rest in their proper places. If the ruler makes no mistakes, the people naturally attain their due; if the ruler does not act crookedly, the people naturally become upright. Why do the forms and natures of things become lost? It is all because the ruler disturbs them, leading to such decay. Returning to nature is concealment; employing nature is manifestation. When things are made manifest, all recognize them; when things are made easy, all dare to act. When burdens are lightened, all can bear them; when strength is matched to capacity, all can reach. When the people know their strength is exhausted, they resort to deceit to avoid punishment. As rulers daily produce deceit, where can scholars find truth?

Lü’s commentary: Ju was once a man of rank. Removing his court robe to cover the condemned man expressed his compassion. This act made clear that he had once committed such a crime, so he did not shy from reproach. When those above cannot forget honor and disgrace, the people see what ails them; when they cannot轻 wealth and goods, the people see what they contend over. Now, by establishing what ails people and making them ill, amassing what they contend over and making them contend, how can one expect them not to steal, kill, or incur death?

Tang and Wu held that when the myriad regions bore guilt, it lay with the One Man; that gains belonged to the people and losses to themselves. Yi Yin said that if even one man was not reaped, it was his own fault; if even one person lost their proper form, he would withdraw and take responsibility. Now, the ignorant are not enlightened, the fearful are not blamed, the incapable are not punished, and the distant are not reached—how different this is from the former kings who pardoned the ignorant, measured human strength, and pitied the incapable!

When the people know their strength is exhausted, they have no choice but to resort to deceit. When superiors produce much deceit, how can inferiors avoid deceit? Yan Du’s commentary: The great Dao scatters daily, and fraud and deceit arise daily; the people suffer disasters from this beginning. What crime have you committed to encounter this first? Is it not because you did not steal?

Have you not committed murder? What follows concerns the great disasters—honor and disgrace, wealth and property, the impoverishment and ruin of the people, and the like.

In high antiquity, men did not contend over honor and disgrace, so they knew not what ailed them; they did not hoard wealth and property, so they knew not what to fight over. Today’s rulers stand atop honor and disgrace, dwell amid wealth and property—thus summoning the very ailments of the people and gathering the roots of their strife. They further burden them with heavy exactions to the point of exhaustion, and ceaseless corvée leaves them no respite. Even if they wished not to die, it would be impossible. To take success as belonging to the people and failure as one’s own responsibility—this was the way of the ancient rulers who cherished the people and turned inward to examine themselves. But now it is not so. The following four lines point to the governance of the present rulers.

They conceal things for their own ends and deem the unknowing as foolish—this pattern may be discerned in what follows. All these measures run counter to human nature and are devised in defiance of it. When the people know their inner strength is exhausted and can no longer endure, they resort to deceit. Those above cannot return to the root but fuss over trifles—how can they hope to remedy or halt this?

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:**
Viewing a household through the lens of the household, viewing a state through the lens of the state—then the world remains the same. When Duke Qi saw a condemned man executed and covered him with his court robes to weep over him, this was the ancient ritual. He grieved that the failure of virtuous governance had brought things to this pass. For when honor and disgrace are established and wealth and property amassed, the calamity of executions is already set, and the strife of banditry and plunder overflows. Can one hope to escape great disaster?

Laozi said: “To bear the state’s misfortune is to be king of the world.” But now they have turned against the ancient Way! They conceal the canonical laws to keep the common people ignorant, devise inconvenient measures and punish those who resist, impose onerous burdens and penalize the mediocre, enforce relentless schedules and execute the slow and weak. When the people’s strength and wisdom are exhausted, they think only of deceiving their lord and misleading their superiors. Since those above have lost their authenticity, the people follow their transformation.

If one wishes the stream to run clear, one must purify the source!

**Yanzhai’s Oral Teachings:**
“Have you not...?”—is it not because you have committed theft or murder? Honor and disgrace are matters of reputation; wealth and property are matters of profit—these are the ailments that bring harm and exhaustion. When those above crave reputation, these harms arise. When a state is fond of amassing wealth, strife follows.

The lines on “losing the upright and gaining the crooked” and “if the hundred clans have faults, it lies with me alone” mean that if even one thing loses its proper form, one withdraws and takes responsibility—as if, when a single commoner is not bathed in grace, one had cast him into a ditch oneself. They hide their possessions and say nothing, yet deem the unknowing as foolish. They impose tasks too difficult to bear and punish those who dare not undertake them. They assign heavy burdens without measuring human strength, set distant journeys without calculating human capacity. When they demand what exceeds human strength, the people must respond with deceit; when they demand what exceeds human understanding, the people must respond with fraud. When exactions are insatiable, the people must resort to theft to meet them.

Thus, those above compel them to deceit, fraud, and theft—yet whom can one blame? When Xiang Ju sought to travel the world, the Master sang of climbing the mast and drifting to sea. When Duke Qi saw a condemned man executed on the road, the governance of the states of his time could be known. Covering the body with court robes and weeping—this was the utmost in compassion and sorrow.

In the world, cold, hunger, sickness, hardship, imprisonment, bereavement, and grief are all called disasters, yet none is more grievous to life and nature than execution. Why have you alone been the first to suffer this? Have you not committed theft? Have you not committed murder?

How has it come to such an extremity! Could it not be that the pursuit of honor and disgrace, wealth and property, has invited illness and provoked strife, leading to this? To establish what people resent and gather what they contend over—this has been the case for so long; how can disaster be avoided?

These words carry an implied critique of contemporary governance. In ancient times, those who ruled the world held compassion in their hearts, fearing even a single person might lose their proper place. Thus, their governance was perfected, and their transformative influence harmonious. Today, however, it is not so—here, the text directly points to the failures of present rule.

Those who speak incur no blame; those who hear should take it as a warning. The conclusion, asking whom one can blame, also conveys a sense of lamentation and insufficiency. May those in positions of authority turn inward and examine themselves! If they truly can moderate their own desires, eliminate suffering, and end strife, the people will be transformed by their virtue, and punishments will fall into disuse—would this not be perfect in every way?

[Note: *"One form should correspond to one thing"*—a scribal error, as noted in Yongzhai’s commentary.]

*Zhuangzi: The Ocean of Meanings, Annotated and Elucidated*, Scroll 85

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin on *"Then Yang"* (Chapter Four)

Master Ju of Swift Virtue was sixty years of age and had undergone sixty transformations. Never did he begin with what was deemed "right" only to end by condemning it as "wrong"—yet how could he know that what he now called "right" was not the "wrong" of his fifty-ninth year?

All things possess life, yet none perceive their root; all emerge, yet none perceive their gate. People all honor the knowledge their knowing can grasp, but none know to rely on the knowing that lies beyond their knowledge—can this not be called the greatest of doubts?

Alas! Alas! There is no escape from this.

Is this what is meant by "so it is," or is it so?

Guo’s commentary:
*"Transformation"* means following the world without being bound to self or other. Flowing with things in harmony, it accords with the changes of their nature. These changes have no fixed limit; without root or gate, they arise suddenly and naturally—thus none can perceive them. Only those who transcend birth and emergence can glimpse their gate and fathom their root. What I do not know, other things may know. To employ the knowledge of things is to be without ignorance; to rely solely on my own knowledge is to know little indeed. If one does not depend on things for knowledge but instead exalts one’s own, then things will not conform—what is this if not the greatest doubt? Unable to use that which lies beyond oneself, one finds no place to lodge the self. Those who claim to be "right" are not so in the eyes of the world.

Lü’s commentary:
Master Ju, at sixty, had undergone sixty transformations, never failing to begin with what he deemed "right" only to end by condemning it as "wrong"—just like Confucius. Yet if knowing does not halt at what lies beyond its grasp, then what is called "right" remains unsettled. How, then, can one be certain that what is now deemed "right" was not the "wrong" of fifty-nine? Since the root of things’ birth and the gate of their emergence are unseen, what lies beyond knowledge is precisely the source from which the myriad things arise. Yet people all honor the knowledge they possess, while fearing the void of what they do not know, refusing to rely upon it. They turn back at the edge of the cliff—how great is their doubt! Alas! Alas! There is no escape, for such a one can never reach the ultimate, and the world cannot contain them. Even if what is now said seems "right," how can one be sure it is truly so? Let words be forgotten to grasp its truth.

**Du Zhu’s Annotation:**
From youth to old age, the new and old replace one another, yet one dwells within the transformations of creation without perceiving its passage. Boyi could follow the daily renewal of change, yet never did he not begin with what was "right" only to end with what was "wrong"—how could he know that what is now called "right" was not the "wrong" of fifty-nine years past? The root of things’ birth is the root of Heaven and Earth; the gate of their emergence is the Gate of the Mysterious Female. Both originate from the Valley Spirit, their source is one. What knowledge grasps is the work of the wise; what lies beyond knowledge is the work of the sage. To honor wisdom alone and not honor sagacity—can this not be called great doubt? Alas! Alas! Words are not as good as stilling the mind that grasps and contains. The myriad things within creation follow a principle from which there is no escape. What I deem "right," another may deem "wrong"—this is how disputes arise. Each abiding in what they deem "right" is fitting.

**Bi Xu’s Annotation:**
Transformations never cease—cross arms, and it is already lost. Those in the world who seek "right" do not seek the Dao/Way, but seek companions for themselves. Those who reject "wrong" do not reject crookedness, but reject what offends their hearts. What aligns with me may not truly be "right"; what offends my heart may not truly be "wrong"—hence the lament of beginning with "right" and ending with "wrong." Fifty-nine was once deemed "right," but if one now awakens to its "wrong," one knows the past was not truly "right." To know that what is "right" is not truly "right"—only one who deems nothing "right" encounters no "wrong." Thus, ultimate "right" holds no "wrong," and ultimate "wrong" holds no "right." The void and the indistinct are the root of the supreme Dao/Way; the bland and the still are the gate of the manifold mysteries. This is whence the myriad things emerge. What humans know arises from what they do not know; it is through not-knowing that they come to know. Those who fail to understand this—can this not be called great doubt? Worldly affairs entangle, renewing their changes daily. Between knowing and not-knowing, nothing is better than stillness. What is known pertains to human affairs; what is unknown pertains to Heaven’s principle. Human affairs involve action, and "right" and "wrong" cannot escape; Heaven’s principle involves non-action—how could it escape? If one deems what they know to be "right," many will deem it "wrong." Is what is said truly so? Words may not be "right."

**Yanqi’s Oral Exegesis:**
At sixty, one has undergone sixty transformations, each year’s understanding surpassing the last. Yet how can one be certain that what is "right" at sixty is truly "right"? All things that are born have a root; all that emerge have a gate—yet people do not see this, for it lies beyond their knowledge. Ordinary people know what they know and do not know what they do not know, yet deem this the ultimate—this is great delusion. "No escape" means it is so of itself, naturally. The knowledge of not-knowing pervades past and present, penetrates above and below—where is this principle absent? How could one escape it? *Yu hu* are both expressions of doubt. What changes visibly is called "transformation"; what changes invisibly is called "transmutation." At sixty, having lived sixty years in the world, one’s form, countenance, knowledge, and ability to comprehend affairs are subtly altered by creation, changing without awareness—never not beginning with "right" and ending with "wrong." Only upon reaching the age of harmonious hearing, after long experience, can "right" and "wrong" be settled and the principles of things clarified—yet one still does not know whether what is now called "right" was not the "wrong" of fifty-nine years past. This speaks of the endless transformations of things, the endless changes of affairs, and the endless shifts of the human heart. These three intermingle and transmute, forming past and present, revealing gains and losses. When affairs are resolved and principles settled, "right" and "wrong" become clear—yet one still does not know how future generations will judge them. People accumulate experiences to form an era; affairs accumulate changes to form transformations. Like mosquitoes and gnats, like wild horses passing before one’s eyes—countless, yet one’s innermost, true, and constant nature never alters. One who knows this will not be moved by life and death. The birth, death, emergence, and entry of things have roots and gates, yet people do not see them. They all honor what they know, deeming it their own ability, yet do not rely on what they do not know to attain true knowledge. If one truly knows what they do not know, the roots and gates of the myriad things become visible! Their birth, death, emergence, and entry follow constant principles. Whether they transform or not, one transforms with them—what confusion could there be? What humans know and can do is but a ten-thousandth part of what they do not know and cannot do. Even sages cannot exhaust it—how could knowledge and ability escape the transformations of things? Nevertheless, what I now deem "right" may not truly be so. All sages’ discussions of transformation include words of caution, unwilling to fix their meaning—this is the subtlety that cannot be definitively explained, the very essence of transformation.

Confucius asked the Grand Historian Da Qiang, Bo Changqian, and Xi Wei: "Duke Ling of Wei indulged in wine and revelry, neglecting state affairs; he hunted and fowled, ignoring the affairs of the feudal lords. What made him 'Ling' (Illustrious)?" Da Qiang replied: "It was because of this."

Bo Changqian said: "Duke Ling had three wives, with whom he bathed in promiscuous abandon. When the historian Qi presented himself in attendance, the Duke clasped gifts in hand and supported him with reverent care. Though his negligence was so extreme, his deference to the worthy was so solemn—this is what made him 'Ling.'"

Xi Wei said: "When Duke Ling died, divination for burial at the ancestral tomb proved inauspicious, while divination at Shaqiu proved auspicious. Digging several *ren* deep, they found a stone outer coffin. Washing and inspecting it, they saw an inscription that read: *'Do not rely on your son—Duke Ling will seize and bury him here.'* That Duke Ling would be called 'Ling' was fated long ago! How could these two men comprehend it?"

Guo’s commentary: *Ling* is the posthumous title for the unprincipled. Bathing with women was a breach of ritual; yet when Qi was deemed worthy and offered service, the Duke clasped gifts and supported him, preventing the full observance of propriety—this is what is meant by solemn reverence for the worthy. The *bi* were items for the attendant’s service. By honoring the worthy, he sought to compensate for his private impropriety. *Ling* has two meanings—it may also be called good, which is why Confucius inquired about it. The inscription said: *"You speak of Ji Zhe, saying he is unreliable—Duke Ling will seize your place."* All things are predetermined by fate, so future events may be known. Thus, what one must do cannot be left undone, and what one cannot do cannot be forced. Yet fools believe their actions are self-determined—how deluded! They merely recognize what has already occurred, unaware that even these outcomes arise from nature.

Lü’s commentary: Da Qiang and Bo Changqian judged by human standards, while Xi Wei judged by Heaven’s decree. Judging by Heaven, though the title was *Ling*, it was truly not something within human power to determine.

Yi Du’s commentary: These three were all Grand Historians, which is why Confucius questioned them. Duke Ling indulged in wine and revelry—this was dissipation; he hunted and fowled—this was neglect. Yet why was he granted *Ling* as his title? Da Qiang said, *"It was because of this,"* meaning *Ling* is the posthumous title for the unprincipled, a title that follows the law of names without diminishing its bearer.

Bo Changqian said: "The Duke bathed with his three wives, and when Historian Shan presented himself in attendance, the Duke had him grasp the ceremonial silk and support him as he emerged—this was his way of honoring the worthy, and thus his posthumous title was *Ling*."

Xi Wei said: "When the Duke died, divination was performed at Longshaqiu, where an inscribed outer coffin was unearthed, reading: *'Not relying on his son, Duke Ling seized and buried it.'* This spoke of the unalterable principle of Heaven: the land originally belonged to the Duke’s father, yet it was his son who obtained it—thus the Duke’s *Ling* title was destined long ago. How could those two [Da Qiang and Bo Changqian] comprehend this?"

Bixu’s commentary: "In the system of posthumous titles, *Ling* denotes one who was disordered yet unharmed, or whose virtue was luminous and numinous. His *Ling* was predestined, the title naturally aligning with the unseen decree. How could worldly sentiment fathom the principles of the transcendent and the hidden?"

*Yanzhai Oral Teachings*: "Given the Duke of Wei’s conduct, why was his title *Ling*? It was insufficient to match his wickedness. *Fengyu* (presenting in attendance) is akin to what we now call a summons. *Bo* means to grasp while assisting in an audience. *Bi* refers to the ceremonial silk—the Duke had others support him, demonstrating propriety."

At Shaqiu, where the ancients buried their dead, the stone outer coffin bore the name of *Ling* Gong long before his birth—thus his title was fixed in life, and what power had man over it? Not relying on his descendants means posterity cannot be entrusted; this land was destined for *Ling* Gong. The *Ling* posthumous title may signify either good or evil, which is why the Master questioned the three men.

Daji replied that precisely because of his conduct, his title was *Ling*—thus *Ling* clearly denoted a ruler without the Way. Bo Changqian said the Duke bathed with his three wives, an act of utmost impropriety, yet when a worthy minister presented tribute and assisted him in audience, attendants supported him with ceremonial silk as he emerged. The *bi* refers to the robes and goods offered by the attendant. Amidst the blazing fires of human desire, a single thread of Heavenly principle remained unobliterated—thus to call him *Ling* was nearly justifiable in good terms.

Xiwei said the Duke divined his burial site and found an inscribed stone coffin bearing the name *Ling* Gong in radiant clarity, its numinous resonance spanning a thousand years. His *Ling* title was thus long predestined, and how could those two comprehend it? The principle is the same as with the coffin of Chufu. The finest burial grounds of the Lord of Teng were all foreordained—how could his posthumous title be mere chance! Yet one must still fulfill human effort to accord with Heavenly principle; the beauty or ugliness of the title depends on one’s conduct in life, and thus one must be vigilant. The system of posthumous titles began with the Duke of Zhou, using a single character to express praise or censure—how solemn indeed!

Those who failed to cultivate a good name were called *Ling*; among the rulers of antiquity who met unvirtuous ends, some bore the title *Ling*, like King Li. Yet from the perspective of the enlightened, good and evil are both forgotten, past and present are equally without trace, and without rank or title, one flows in harmony with transformation, leaving no room for others to judge merit or fault—is this not the perfection of undifferentiated wholeness?

The three men each gave one answer: the first spoke of his lack of the Way, the second of his respect for worthies, and the third of the fixity of Heavenly principle. Judging by their words, there are differences in quality, yet ultimately none escape the fixity of Heavenly principle.

Shaozhi asked Taigong Diao: "What is meant by *qiuli* (village and hamlet) speech?"

Taigong Diao replied: "*Qiuli* refers to the customs formed by combining ten clans and a hundred names. It unites the disparate into sameness and disperses the same into difference. Now, if you point to the hundred parts of a horse and cannot obtain the horse, yet the horse stands before you—it is by assembling its hundred parts that you call it a horse. Thus, hills accumulate the lowly to become high, rivers gather waters to become vast, and great men unite all to become public-spirited. Therefore, what enters from without has a master but is not clung to; what issues from within has a norm but is not resisted.

The four seasons have distinct *qi*, yet Heaven does not bestow them, and so the year is complete. The five officials have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not favor them, and so the state is well-governed. The great men of culture and martial prowess do not bestow virtue, and so their power is complete. The myriad things have distinct principles, yet the Dao does not favor them, and so it is without name. Without name, it is without action; without action, yet nothing is left undone.

Times have beginnings and ends; the world undergoes transformations. Fortune and misfortune flow ceaselessly—what seems adverse may be fitting elsewhere; what is correct in one case may err in another. Compared to a great marsh, all materials find their measure; viewed from a great mountain, trees and stones share the same ground. This is what is meant by *qiuli* speech."

Shaozhi said: "Then is this sufficient to be called the Dao?"

Taigong Diao replied: "No. Now, the number of things is not limited to ten thousand, yet we call them the 'myriad things' because we name and refer to them by their greatest number. Thus, Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; yin and yang are the greatest of *qi*; the Dao is their commonality. To name and refer to them by their greatness is permissible, but once named, how can it be compared! If we use this analogy, it is like comparing dogs and horses—it falls far short.

Guo’s commentary: The great man is impartial toward the world, and so the world’s customs become one. What enters from without is the transformation wrought by the great man; what issues from within is the nature of the people and things. When nature is correct, the people do not act contrary to their hearts; when transformation is perfectly impartial, the ruler has nothing to cling to. Thus, he can unite villages and hamlets, unify the world, harmonize the myriad things, and level all differences.

Distinct *qi* exist naturally, and so they endure; if they were originally nonexistent and bestowed by Heaven, they would sometimes cease. Distinct duties arise from innate talents, and so they are entrusted accordingly—not privately granted by favor. Even culture and martial prowess are not bestowed by the great man; if they were granted, they might sometimes be lacking. How could this apply only to culture and martial prowess? All natures are like this.

Names are limited by reality, and so there is non-action; realities each act on their own, and so nothing is left undone. Times and eras change, and the mindless follow them. What is perverse here may be fitting there; what is correct here may err there. Each is true to its application and cannot be separated. Compared to the great marsh and great mountain, nothing is discarded—this is uniting the disparate into sameness.

To speak of *qiuli* is to encompass the world. Countable things are not limited to ten thousand—how much less can the uncountable be called sufficient for the Dao! The Dao pervades things without partiality; to forcibly name it 'Dao' is what is meant by 'the Dao that can be spoken.' Once named, how can it be compared? The distinctions of names fall far short. Thus, to call it the Dao is still insufficient; it must lie in the realm of namelessness and wordlessness to be truly attained."

Lü’s commentary: Combining names into *qiuli* unites the different into sameness; dispersing *qiuli* into names turns sameness into difference. It is not like the speech of a single household, where differences cannot be united and sameness cannot be dispersed. The hundred parts are all the horse, yet pointing to them does not yield the horse—only by assembling the hundred parts do you call it a horse. This is like the great man who does not regard his greatness in its entirety; then even what is called great cannot be obtained. The comparison to hills and rivers shows the utmost of greatness.

Thus, from the perspective of things, the myriad things are all complete within me. What enters from without has a master within and is not clung to; it embraces the myriad without excluding anything."

From my perspective, when I observe all things flowing away in their myriad forms, what emerges from within has its proper alignment and does not resist; it circulates without exclusion. Heaven, in relation to the four seasons, does not bestow them as gifts based on their inherent nature—were it otherwise, its works would be incomplete and the year would not reach fulfillment. The ruler, in relation to the five offices, does not claim their functions as his own by withholding them from the many—were it otherwise, his wisdom would be incomplete and the state would not be governed. King Wen and the Duke of Zhou possessed distinct talents; the myriad things follow distinct principles. Yet their way of neither bestowing nor claiming as private is no different from this.

Without partiality, there is no self; without self, nothing can be named. Without name, there is no action; without action, there is nothing that is not done. The changes of the times do not cease; fortune and misfortune have no constancy. What is adverse may yet be fitting; what is good may yet become ominous. The dispositions of things each pursue their own ends, their faces varied and not uniform. What is upright may yet be askew; what is correct may yet appear strange. Since the principles of things are so unequal, the Dao levels them through impartiality, never allowing the mind to incline toward conformity among them. This is like the great marsh where all the hundred forests are complete, or the great mountain where wood and stone are undivided—this is what is meant by the speech of *qiuli*.

The Dao is but a forced name; to call it the Dao is not sufficient. All things are boundless, and the myriad cannot exhaust their number—yet we speak of the myriad because it is the largest number we can name. Heaven and earth are vast in form; yin and yang are vast in *qi*. The Dao levels them through impartiality, and thus it is neither form nor *qi*, and so has no name. That the name is insufficient to exhaust the Dao yet we name it the Dao is also because we use the greatest term to describe it. Originally nameless, yet we impose a name upon it—then it has already come into being, and how can it compare to what is nameless? To take what is called the Dao as the Dao itself is like mistaking a dog for a horse.

*Yidu’s Commentary*: Ten households make a *qiu*; twenty households make a *li*. *Qiuli* combines ten surnames and a hundred clans into shared customs, yet it does not know to unite all under heaven as the public good. To unite difference into sameness and disperse sameness into difference is to distance oneself further from the Dao and set things further at odds. Pointing to the hundred parts of a horse does not yield the horse; assembling the hundred parts and calling it a horse is to disperse sameness into difference and unite difference into sameness. Hills accumulate from the lowly; rivers converge from streams—this illustrates how the great person unites all under heaven as the public good. Only through impartiality can what enters from without find its master within and not be clung to; not clinging, it can flow freely. What emerges from within finds its proper alignment without and does not resist; not resisting, it can circulate. Thus, without partiality, all under heaven is one; without bestowal, the myriad things reach fulfillment. The *qi* of the four seasons differ, yet heaven does not bestow them, so the year is complete. The duties of the five offices differ, yet the ruler does not claim them as private, so the state is governed. Even in the distinct tasks of King Wen and the Duke of Zhou or the distinct principles of the myriad things, the ruler’s Dao is without partiality—thus virtue is complete and nameless, and without bestowal, things fulfill themselves. Receiving the beneficence of the marsh without gratitude, without partiality one is naturally upright, and achievements are accomplished without recompense.

The great Dao is without partiality toward things, thus it is nameless and without action; without action, things each act on their own, and there is nothing that is not done. The world changes with the times; fortune and misfortune lie in wait for one another. What is adverse may yet be fitting, for faces and directions differ. What is upright may yet be askew, for each clings to their own view. This is like the great marsh where different villages serve the same use, or the great mountain where different plants share the same altar—uniting difference into sameness without departing from form and number, this is what is called the speech of *qiuli*. Heaven and earth, yin and yang are the greatest in form and *qi*; the Dao levels them through impartiality, and all are named for their greatness. Yet if this is already so, how can the small and large, noble and base compare to it?

*Bixu’s Commentary*: In the *Rites of Zhou*, four wells make a settlement, four settlements make a *qiu*, five households make a *bu*, and five *bu* make a *li*. Combining the differences of ten surnames and a hundred names into the customs of a single *qiu* or *li*, or dispersing the customs of a single *qiu* or *li* into the differences of ten surnames and a hundred names, is like separating the hundred parts of a horse—head, tail, eyes, ears—and then combining them to call it a horse. This is the meaning of Gongsun Long’s "separating hardness and whiteness" and "uniting sameness and difference." Mountains accumulate from many stones; rivers converge from a hundred streams. The great person unites commanderies and states into the public good—divided, Chu and Yue are distinct; united, their customs become one, no different from the combining and dispersing of *qiuli*. What enters from without finds its master within, so affairs do not stagnate. What emerges from within aligns with principle without deviation, so principle extends far. The *qi* of heat and cold differ, yet heaven entrusts them without bestowal, so the year’s work is complete. The duties of the offices differ, yet the ruler delegates without claiming them as private, so all under heaven is governed. The villages of King Wen and the Duke of Zhou differ, yet the great person entrusts them without bestowal, so virtue and enterprise are complete. The principles of plants and animals differ, yet the Dao gives rise to them without partiality, so it is nameless. Things name themselves; the Dao does not force names upon them. Things act on their own; the Dao does not force action upon them. The Dao does nothing, and thus can do everything. The alternation of winter and spring, the rise and fall of emperors and kings—what is misfortune or calamity here may be fortune or fitting there. This is like the great marsh where all materials, great and small, meet the standard, or the great mountain where wood and stone, refined and coarse, gather on the same altar—this is what is meant by the speech of *qiuli*.

The great Dao is boundless; things are also inexhaustible. Now, to name it based on the largest number and call it the myriad—if things were limited to the myriad, then the Dao would also have a limit, and how could it be worthy of being called "prior to the Lord on High"? The great Dao unites form and *qi* through impartiality, and by forced naming is called "great" and designated the Dao. Yet once it is called the great Dao, it has already come into being—how can it compare to what has never yet emerged from its source?

*Yuanzhai’s Oral Teachings*: Gathering wells makes a *qiu*; gathering *qiu* makes a *li*. Within a *li*, ten surnames and a hundred names—though people and things differ, their customs are the same. This is the metaphor of uniting difference into sameness.

Within a *qiu* or *li*, speech is the shared discourse of that *li*. Uniting differences to form sameness, the myriad things share one principle. Dispersing sameness to form differences, each of the myriad things has its own principle. Combining a hundred parts to make a horse—no single part bears the name "horse," yet assembling those hundred parts is called a horse. Uniting to form impartiality is to unite the differences of the myriad things into sameness.

There is a master yet no attachment; attachment contradicts spontaneity. Rectitude is the principle of the myriad things emerging from the heart—when this principle does not oppose things, there is no sameness or difference. Without conferring favor or claiming merit, the myriad things with their distinct principles are united by the great Dao into impartiality, thus defying all naming.

"Flowing abundantly" describes its ceaseless movement. "Mutual dependence" is its lack of constancy—what seems adverse may in fact be fitting. Like the old man who lost his horse, people cling to their own pursuits as faces differ from one another. What is deemed correct may become rigid, and rigidity may lead to loss.

For example, the timber of great mountains and marshes—trees and stones—all meet the measure and serve a use, uniting differences into sameness. Counting things by number gives the myriad; summing forms and *qi* yields Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang. The Dao governs them with impartiality, all spoken of in terms of their greatness. Yet even with the name "Dao," how can this compare to that which has never yet emerged from its source?

Within every *qiu* and *li*, there are those revered for age and virtue. Examining the sentiments of the multitude to establish discourse—this is like the monthly critiques of the Han or the local sayings of each *li*, recording customs and affairs. Such is the speech of *qiu* and *li*, uniting differences into sameness. Though all emerge from the same *qiu* and *li*, disparities arise in youth and age, worthiness and foolishness, wealth and poverty, gain and loss—sameness giving rise to difference.

The vastness of the world begins with *qiu* and *li*; the greatness of the Dao pervades all affairs. Dispersing sameness to form difference is like the hundred parts of a horse. Uniting differences to form sameness is to assemble those hundred parts and call it a horse. In speech, there is union and separation; in profound insight, all returns to undifferentiated oneness. The principle reaches its ultimate, beyond the capacity of words.

Mountains accumulate from the lowly; rivers converge from waters. The great person unites with impartiality—this principle is no different. One who can aptly unite *qiu* and *li* may likewise unite the sentiments of all under Heaven. It lies solely in the word "impartiality." As the *Dao Classic* states: "Impartiality becomes king; the king is what all under Heaven turn toward—how could one refuse?"

What enters from without is learning; the noble person’s learning centers on the Dao, and centering on the Dao, nothing is impassable. What emerges from within is thought; the noble person’s thought is rectified by principle, and rectified by principle, nothing opposes it. Like the four seasons with their distinct *qi* forming a year, or the five offices with their distinct duties forming governance, all culminate in the completeness of the great person’s virtue, illuminating the Dao’s impartiality—how could it be named?

Nameless, it is non-action; through non-action, nothing is left undone—this is the inevitable course of principle. Yet times shift and circumstances alternate between concealment and revelation. What seems adverse may be fitting, and what is deemed correct may err—all due to clinging to one’s own sentiments, which leads to divergent paths.

For instance, the hundred villages of a great marsh, united for the use of a master craftsman—difference becomes sameness. The trees and stones of a great mountain, dispersed for the use of all under Heaven—sameness becomes difference. If one profoundly unites with principle and returns to the Dao, what need is there for debate over sameness and difference?

The name "Dao" does not exhaust the Dao; numbering things as the myriad does not exhaust things. Each is spoken of in terms of its greatness. The greatest of forms is governed by Heaven and Earth; the greatest of *qi* is governed by Yin and Yang. The Dao, in turn, governs Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang—how could its greatness be measured? Yet once the name "Dao" exists, it cannot compare to the nameless. Thus, the Dao of the perfected person operates without name, and all under Heaven cannot name it.

This chapter resembles the *Discourse on Equalizing Things* in its discussion of being and non-being, life and death, yet here it pertains more to the Way of governance, further unfolding the theme of *qiu* and *li* discourse in a still more extraordinary manner. The intent behind establishing names is to embody impartiality and harmonize all under Heaven—this is what those of limited understanding should inquire about.

*Collected Explications of the Ocean of Meanings of the True Scripture of Nanhua*, Scroll Eighty-Five, concludes.

**Collected Explications of the Ocean of Meanings of the True Scripture of Nanhua, Scroll Eighty-Six**

**Chapter Five: "Ze Yang"**

Shaozhi said: Within the four directions, encompassing the six conjunctions, whence do the myriad things arise?

Taigong Diao replied: Yin and Yang illuminate, cover, and govern one another; the four seasons alternate, engender, and destroy. Desire and aversion, departure and approach—thus do they bridge and arise. Male and female unite in their customary pairing. Safety and danger transform into one another; fortune and misfortune beget each other; urgency and delay grind together; gathering and scattering thus take form. These are the names and realities that may be recorded, the essences that may be inscribed.

Following the sequence of their ordering, bridging and revolving in mutual employment—when exhausted, they return; when ended, they begin anew. This is what things inherently possess, what words exhaust, what knowledge attains—nothing more than the limits of things. Those who perceive the Dao do not follow what has been abandoned, nor trace what has arisen. Here discussion comes to rest.

Shaozhi said: Jizhen’s doctrine of "non-action" and Jiezi’s doctrine of "contingent agency"—which of these two teachings accords with reality? Which is partial to its own principle?

Taigong Diao replied: The crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs are what people know. Yet even one of great wisdom cannot, in words, exhaust how they transform of themselves, nor can they fathom what they will do next. Dissecting this to its utmost, its subtlety reaches the unparalleled; its vastness, the immeasurable. Whether contingent agency or non-action, one remains bound to things and thus errs in the end. Contingent agency is substantive; non-action is empty. Having name and reality, it resides in things. Without name or reality, it dwells in the emptiness of things. What can be spoken or conceived—speaking of it only increases its remoteness. What has not yet arisen cannot be hindered; what has already perished cannot be obstructed. Life and death are not distant, yet their principle cannot be seen. Contingent agency and non-action are but borrowed terms for doubt.

I observe their root—its going is without end. I seek their end—its coming is without cease. Without end, without cease, words fail, yet they share the same principle as things. Contingent agency and non-action are the root of words, the beginning and end of things. The Dao cannot be possessed; what is possessed cannot be without it. The name "Dao" is but a borrowed term for its operation. Contingent agency and non-action are but one corner of things—how do they suffice for the great square?

When words suffice, speaking all day exhausts the Dao. When words do not suffice, speaking all day exhausts only things. The ultimate of Dao and things—speech and silence cannot bear it. Neither speech nor silence—discussion reaches its limit.

**Guo’s Annotation:**
To ask whence things arise, some say the Dao generates them. Yet all this is self-so, without anything that generates. All such affairs—advancing and retreating, pursuing and abandoning—arise from the mutual illumination of Yin and Yang, the alternation of the four seasons. Beyond this, they rest in spontaneity. Their mutual ordering and employment are what things inherently possess, not what the non-existent can produce. Beyond things, nothing further exists; thus, knowledge does not surpass the limits of things. Abandonment and arising cannot be traced. Following this, discussion comes to rest.

Some say the Dao is non-action; others say the Dao is contingent agency. Contingent agency implies the power to employ things. Yet things are spontaneous, not what agency can produce. By this reasoning, Jizhen’s words are correct. The utmost subtlety and vastness are self-so, not produced by action. Things mutually employing one another are also self-so; thus, non-action is not contrary to things. All things, in their manifoldness, pass by through non-action. Reality acts of itself, without any agent. "Residing" refers to where things are. Where things are, their reality is utterly empty. One attains it only by seeking beyond words and intentions.

Suddenly, they arise of themselves—I cannot forbid it. Suddenly, they perish of themselves—I cannot oppose it. Near as it is in one’s own body, one still does not see its self-so and yet would grieve over it. These two doctrines are what the world doubts. The principle of things is inexhaustible; thus, knowledge and words are without end. Only then do they share the same principle as things. Constantly non-active, yet spontaneous.

The Dao cannot itself possess; what is possessed is spontaneous. Things proceed by it, hence the borrowed name "Dao." Grasping one corner suffices to know the rest. Seeking the Dao beyond words and intentions is sufficient; failing to forget words and retain intention is insufficient. The ultimate of Dao and things is constantly self-so through non-action, not residing in speech or silence. Its self-so is beyond the discussion of speech and silence.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
Shaozi, having heard the Dao spoken of as existent, finds it incomparable to the Dao and thus doubts its non-existence. He asks whence the myriad things arise—this is what is meant by "being established in emptiness." The sun and moon come and go, rise and fall, wax and wane—illuminating, covering, and harmonizing one another. Cold and heat, contraction and expansion, mutual generation and destruction—alternating, engendering, and destroying. Things born between Heaven and Earth move with Yin and Yang and the four seasons. Thus, desire and aversion, departure and approach ride upon them to proceed; male and female unite in their customary pairing, movement and stillness following constant patterns. Hence, there are matters of safety and danger, fortune and misfortune, gathering and scattering—these names and realities may be recorded, these essences may be inscribed, and they are not beyond inquiry.

The sequence of before and after is called order, mutually ordered yet never disordered. "Bridging" means riding upon them to proceed; "revolving" means relying upon them to cross. Mutually employing, yet never fixed. When exhausted, they return; when ended, they begin anew—this is Yin and Yang, the four seasons. This is what things inherently possess, not the non-existence of the Dao. Words and knowledge reach their limit here—this is whence the myriad things arise, not that they arise from what generates them.

Having name, it is the mother of the myriad things—so it is. As for those who perceive the Dao, they have never been without things, hence they do not follow what has been abandoned; they have never possessed things, hence they do not trace what has arisen. Serene and nameless, they emerge beyond the six conjunctions—how could words and knowledge reach them? Jizhen’s non-action follows what has been abandoned.

Jiezi posits "or-employing," tracing to their origins. The crowing of roosters and barking of dogs—these are their transformations, what they have already become; the causes of their crowing and barking, what they will become. When essence reaches its utmost without comparison, there is no interior; when vastness cannot be encompassed, there is no exterior. Between "or-employing" and "non-action," where indeed do they lie? This is why one remains entangled with things: by not cleaving to reality, one cleaves instead to emptiness. Taking named reality as the dwelling of things, one fails to see that it has never truly existed; taking nameless reality as the emptiness of things, one fails to see that it has never truly been absent. Thus, the more one speaks, the more distant one becomes.

Life and death cannot be refused or halted—they transcend speech and thought, though near at hand, they cannot be perceived. "Or-employing" and "non-action" are but borrowed doubts, not the true principle. Proceeding without end, one meets no beginning; coming without cease, one follows no end. This is the principle of things, not their form. "Or-employing" and "non-action" can be spoken and conceived, yet they remain bound to things from beginning to end—how then can one perceive the ceaseless and boundless? The Dao cannot be possessed, for it is without possession; possession cannot be without, for it arises from non-being, not from my own negation.

Thus, the Dao is but a provisional name—how can a name be the Dao? "Non-action" and "or-employing" are but partial aspects of things—how can they align with the great Dao? To speak and exhaust the Dao is rare speech, natural speech. To speak and exhaust things is excessive speech, leading to exhaustion. Viewed from things, the Dao is not a thing; viewed from the Dao, no thing is not the Dao. The ultimate of Dao and things cannot be borne by speech or silence.

One who speaks all their life without having spoken does not truly speak; one who remains silent all their life without having failed to speak does not truly remain silent. Only when discourse reaches this point does it attain its limit.

*Dubi’s Annotation:*
Yin and Yang illuminate each other as sun and moon, unite as heaven and earth, and govern as wind and rain. The four seasons succeed one another as cold and heat, give rise as spring and summer, and destroy as autumn and winter. From the existence of Yin and Yang, the four seasons, desires and aversions, and male and female arise bridges, safety and danger, fortune and misfortune—all proceed from them. As for their mutual regulation, employment, and the cycles of exhaustion and return, beginning and end—these are what things inherently possess, the utmost that words and knowledge can reach regarding things.

Those who perceive the Dao see beyond form and qi—how could they linger over things or trace the causes of their rise and fall? This is where such discourse ends.

"Non-action" is spontaneity, of heaven; "or-employing" is being made so, of man. Harmonizing all under heaven transcends partiality. The crowing of roosters and barking of dogs are known to all, yet the causes of their crowing and barking, and what they will become, even the wisest cannot fathom through speech or thought. Extending this to the utmost vast or minute, none escapes the workings of things beyond human power.

"Non-action" knows heaven but not man; "or-employing" knows man but not heaven. Clinging to one aspect of things is always an error. The names of emptiness and fullness, being and non-being arise mutually, and the more one speaks or conceives, the more distant one becomes—better to seek beyond speech and thought.

A person’s life and death follow their nature and destiny—who can forbid or halt them? This principle is not distant; it lies within us, like the cycles of the four seasons, unseen. Thus, the theories of "or-employing" and "non-action" seem borrowed doubts, not the ultimate of nature and destiny. Observing the root of returning life, its going is without end; the end of emerging life, its coming is without cease.

To speak of the Dao’s non-being is to share the principle of things; to speak of its being is to share their beginning and end. Neither being nor non-being, beyond forced names—thus, "or-employing" and "non-action" are but partial aspects of things, not the great square, let alone the formless Dao.

He whose speech suffices harbors no doubts within, thus exhausts the Dao; he whose speech does not suffice is the opposite. Better than either is neither speech nor silence, where Dao and things both attain.

*Bixu’s Annotation:*
A lesser knower asked about the arising of the myriad things in the world. Taigong explained the principles of Yin and Yang, the four seasons’ illumination, governance, generation, and destruction, the people’s desires and aversions, the pairing of male and female in birds and beasts. "Bridge-arising" describes loftiness and vigor. Affairs differ in safety and danger, fortune and misfortune, urgency and leisure, gathering and dispersal, yet they transform, give rise, interact, and complete one another in endless variation. Externally, they have names to record; internally, they possess subtleties to note. From heaven and earth to the myriad things, all follow order in mutual regulation and employment. When things are exhausted, they return; when affairs begin, they end.

Zen speech exhausts knowledge, reaching only the coarse limits of things, unable to glimpse the fence of the Dao. Only those who perceive the Dao do not follow the rise and fall of things but let them flourish—while I, gathering and containing, preserve life alone.

Again, he asked about the Dao’s "non-action"—how does it relate to affairs? And the Dao’s "or-employing"—how does it accord with the nature of things? Which is partial, which correct?

The answer: the crowing of roosters and barking of dogs are known to all, yet none know why they crow or bark. If it is "non-action," why do they suddenly crow at dawn or bark at dusk? If it is "or-employing," why do other things not do so? Who knows the principle of silent self-transformation? Who discerns the conditions of what will become? Only by setting aside "non-action" can one examine the conditions of "or-employing"; only by entrusting "or-employing" can one scrutinize the principle of "non-action." Extending this, even the utmost vast or minute cannot escape things, nor avoid entanglement.

Losing the flute of things are names and realities; when names and realities are lost, what remains of things? Only the wondrous Dao’s ultimate principle transcends thought and discussion: when qi comes, life arises; when qi scatters, death follows. Just born, one dies again; just dead, one swiftly lives—this can be called near indeed!

Yet its principle cannot be beheld—it lies solely in obscure enlightenment. "Or-employing" benefits others; "non-action" preserves the self. The enlightened meet its source at every turn; the deluded remain bound by doubt. It is but a borrowed path one treads.

I observe the Dao’s root and branch: empty, vast, and elusive, neither to be pursued nor welcomed. Discussing its boundlessness and ceaselessness differs not from that of flora and fauna. The world takes "useful action" and "non-action" as the foundation of its teachings, yet once teachings take form, they cannot transcend things. Thus, they partake in the dual principles of beginning and end, being and non-being—all proceeding by virtue of the wondrous root.

Ji Zhen’s "non-being" and Jie Zi’s "being" are but partial views, ridiculed by those of profound understanding. When being and non-being are threaded as one, and affairs and principles are both illuminated, words suffice. When words suffice, the Dao is without omission. When being and non-being are clung to in bias, and affairs and principles are set forth in opposition, words fall short. When words fall short, nothing escapes entanglement.

The Dao’s extremity cannot be silenced by silence; things’ extremity cannot be spoken by speech. Only by departing from speech’s speech and forsaking silence’s silence can one obscurely grasp the mechanism of wordless union, beholding with the eye the ultimate subtleties of the myriad wonders.

*Yanzhai Oral Exegesis*:
"Zhao" is like "responding."
"Gai" is like "uniting."
"Xiang zhi" means mutual waxing and waning.
Spring’s birth and autumn’s decay follow the seasons’ passage, giving rise to desires and aversions, departures and approaches, safety and peril, fortune and misfortune—all variations within the same. "Qiao" means arched and rising. "Pian" means division. From desires and aversions onward, their names and realities are subtle yet each visible and recordable.

The mutual principle of sequential change is the mutual lifting of yin and yang, arched and rising in motion, waxing and waning in turn—hence it is said that poverty and prosperity, beginning and end, are the inevitable patterns of things. The utmost of knowledge extends no further. Only those who know the Dao attribute all that rises and falls to spontaneity.

Thus, discourse reaches its limit here. "No agency" means all events are coincidental; "or agency" implies there is a governing force. The crowing of roosters and barking of dogs illustrate how human understanding differs. Even one of great wisdom cannot exhaust the meaning of what arises or what is to come. If one attempts to analyze this principle by distinguishing great and small speech, it cannot be fully exhausted. All are burdened by things, ultimately deemed as error—asserting that some entity governs them is substantive, while claiming there is no governing force is insubstantial. If substantive, then names become burdens; if insubstantial, both names and realities dissolve. Yet even this "insubstantial" remains bound to things. To speak of "being" or "non-being" is already far removed from the Dao.

That which has not yet arisen cannot be forced into non-arising; when death is due, how can it be obstructed? This principle lies near at hand yet remains unseen. Whether one posits "agency" or "no agency," worldly doubts arise from this very assumption. Observing from the primal state before movement, one sees the endless procession of the past; observing at the moment of cessation after movement, one sees the ceaseless arrival of the future. Only by dissolving all directions can one merge with the myriad things as a single body. "Agency" or "no agency"—both remain entangled with things, bound to them from beginning to end, never escaping "being." How then can one attain "non-being"?

Viewed in true reality, even the term "Dao" is but a provisional name. These two doctrines, clinging to one extreme, how can they accord with the great Dao? With true insight, speaking all day does no harm; without true insight, even abundant speech remains mere semblance. The Dao is essence; things are coarse. To seek its ultimate, neither speech nor silence suffices. Within the realm beyond speech and silence lies the most profound discourse. This aligns with what the Buddhists describe: "As I press my finger, the ocean seal radiates light; as you raise a thought, worldly dust stirs first."

Heaven has yin and yang, the four seasons; humans have desires and aversions, departures and approaches; things have male and female, division and union. "Arched rising" emerges from emptiness. "Common existence" arises through function. Events may have no cause or a cause, all emerging from the interplay of heaven, humans, and the myriad things, rooted in the remnants of the Dao. Safety and peril, gathering and dispersal—these eight arise from what precedes, their traces growing coarser. Through careful enumeration and observation, nothing is left unrecorded. Following the sequence of principles, the duties of ruler and minister, father and child become clear; relying on the empty movement of function, the mechanisms of reversal and return, beginning and end, are revealed. Thus, the extent of knowledge reaches its limit in things. This is the discourse of governing the world, the affairs within the realm.

As for those beyond the realm who perceive the Dao, they do not follow the rise and fall of things, nor trace their origins. Having forgotten both beginning and end, the middle also ceases to exist—where then is room for conjecture? In their time, Ji Zhen and Jie Zi held these two doctrines, each clinging to one side, like Yang Zhu’s egoism and Mo Di’s universal love. Because they did not accord with the Dao, they were derided as the crowing of roosters and barking of dogs. People recognize the sounds but not their cause—how then can I claim to understand the self-transformation in the doctrines of these two?

Analyzing this principle, whether in the minutest or vastest, "agency" or "no agency," all remain bound to things, never free from ceasing. "Agency" has a cause and is thus substantive; "no agency," though insubstantial, has a name and is thus substantive. To be bound is not to attain complete non-being. Those who once spoke of the Dao invariably departed from four phrases: being, non-being, neither being nor non-being, both being and non-being. To depart from these is the Dao, just as combining east, west, south, and north reveals the center.

Consider the coming and going of the four seasons, the racing of the sun and stars. Heaven moves vigorously without ceasing; the sea inhales and exhales with constancy. Is this "no agency"? Or "agency"? Then is there one who acts? One who commands? The crowing and barking are driven by wind and qi; life and death are driven by the great earth. The four seasons, sun and stars, heaven and sea—all have a true master governing them, yet it acts through non-action, commands through non-command. Human life and death, departures and arrivals cannot be obstructed. This principle lies near at hand yet remains unseen, its meaning the same. Observing its root, the past is endless; observing its end, the future is boundless. One sees that all are subject to creation’s service, from ancient times to the present without cease—not only I, but how can it be fully expressed? All share this principle with things.

If one clings to "agency" or "no agency," then the origin of speech and names arises, bound to things without end. The Dao cannot be possessed; to possess it is to obstruct and stagnate, how then can one reach the wondrous subtlety of emptiness? The Dao resides within the inquiry of being and non-being yet is not attached to either. It borrows being and non-being to act, and there is nowhere it is not the Dao. As for Ji Zhen and Jie Zi, each pursued a partial truth—how could they grasp the great expanse? Speech that suffices attains the essence of the Dao; speech that does not suffice attains only its coarse aspect. Though speech is one, it divides into Dao and things. If one exhausts the emptiness of things, it is the Dao—neither speech nor silence can contain it. Only by transcending beyond speech and silence does one reach the ultimate discourse of the Dao.

Master Chu’s general discussion: This chapter begins with the debates of Ze Yang and Wang Guo, praising Shan Fan’s hidden virtue in stabilizing the marketplace’s competitive winds. Herein lies the insight of the perfected person, skillfully unraveling the entanglements of things, guiding them toward tranquility and harmony. This is called "nourishing people with harmony and transforming them." Its benefits to the Way of governance are manifold! Because he loved the people without cease, the people loved and settled under him without cease. This is using the Dao to aid things, emerging from the truth of nature and emotion—how could the people not be transformed?

The worldly often lose themselves in pursuit of things, drifting ever farther from their original home. When they gaze toward it with longing, how joyful they would be if, before all traces vanish, they could still seek its return—restoring what they once saw, hearing what they once heard! How delightful their reception would be!

Governing the self is like governing a state. When the heart-king is upright, the five officials are well-ordered; when the state’s ruler is upright, his ministers and aides are worthy. This benefits not only the present but also fosters transformation for future generations—just as Tang, having three ministers to guide him, was followed by the Master who carried on his legacy. Is this not like the four seasons completing the year’s work, or the debate between the man of Hedong and the man beyond the heavens?

Later, when Qi and Wei broke their alliance and raised arms, the text invokes the metaphors of *Chu* and *Man* to mock the bellicose rulers of the time, exposing the narrowness of their habits and the futility of their conflicts. Confucius left the Ant Mound, criticizing the suspicion that clings to visible traces. The border guard spoke of planting grain, warning that desire and aversion are the roots of calamity. All these illustrate the essentials of engaging the world and ordering the self. When Boju lamented the condemned man, he took failure as his own, rectifying himself to rectify others. *Huanhuan* followed the transformations of the year, relying on knowing what it did not know—this is using the knowledge of things.

Here again is discussed the method of governing the people and transforming things. Duke Ling’s posthumous title was "Ling" because his burial was determined before the fact; thus, all his actions were unavoidable. The Creator has its fixed reckoning, merely entrusted to human hands! As for the words of villages—gathering and dispersing, sameness and difference—just as a horse is not called a horse by its hundred parts but by its standing form, the great person unifies all into the public good. Though the myriad things differ, the Dao is complete within them, like the hundred villages of a great marsh or the trees and stones of a mountain: some emerge together yet serve different uses, some arise differently yet share a common end. All remain within the transformations of form and qi, yet the ultimate principle is fully realized.

The conclusion takes Jizhen and Jiezi’s discussions of emptiness and fullness as mere attachments, entanglements that do no more than follow the cycle of things. Thus, one must transcend beyond speech and silence, where the heart fuses and the mind attains understanding. There lies the ultimate discourse on the Dao and things—then one knows that what can be spoken or named is not the true constant, and that the Dao cannot be contained by either speech or silence.

*Beginning of the Eighty-Seventh Scroll of the* Southern Florescence True Scripture: An Ocean of Subtleties Compiled

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu, on *"External Things"* (First Chapter)

External things cannot be relied upon—thus, Longfeng was executed, Bigan slain, Jizi feigned madness, Elai died, and Jie and Zhou perished. No ruler fails to desire loyalty from his ministers, yet loyalty does not necessarily earn trust. Hence, Wu Yun was cast into the river, Chang Hong died in Shu, and his blood, preserved for three years, turned to jade. No parent fails to desire filial piety from their children, yet filial piety does not necessarily bring love. Thus, Xiaoji grieved and Zeng Shen sorrowed.

When wood rubs against wood, it ignites; when metal is held to fire, it melts. If yin and yang clash in their movements, heaven and earth are thrown into great turmoil—then there are thunder and lightning, fire within water, even the burning of the great locust tree. When one is deeply entangled in dual perils with no escape, the cicada’s wings fail to form. If the heart is suspended between heaven and earth, weighed down by distress and stagnation, with profit and harm grinding against one another, the fire of life burns fiercely. The multitude scorch their harmony, and the moon, though constant, cannot overcome the fire. Thus, with a sigh, the Dao is exhausted.

**Guo’s Annotation:**
Good and evil alike cannot be relied upon. Blood turning to jade is the utmost sincerity, yet loyalty does not necessarily earn trust, nor filial piety love. Therefore, the perfected person responds to things without a fixed heart, adapting only to change. Heaven and earth in great turmoil—this is what is meant by "clashing movements." If one cannot forget form, they will be ensnared by joy and sorrow wherever they turn, with no right or wrong. The heavier one’s self-regard, the more difficult their position. Without knowing what to hold fast to, the heart cannot be settled. *"Suspended"* refers to one who sits in lofty meditation. *"Weighed down"* means lacking clarity and ease. *"Fire of life"* refers to inner heat. Abandoning profit preserves harmony; if profit and harm linger in the heart, that harmony is scorched. Great and dim, one is burdened by many cares; small and bright, one knows their limits. Only by sighing without self-regard, forgetting form and attaining spontaneity, is the Dao fully realized.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
All that is not the essence of life and destiny is an external thing—thus, it cannot be relied upon. Longfeng and Bigan took benevolence as something to cling to, while Elai, Jie, and Zhou took the lack of benevolence as something to cling to—both met their ends in good and evil alike. If one does not draw near to form and name, what reliance is there? External things are not only unreliable in others but also in oneself. No ruler or parent fails to desire loyalty and filial piety from ministers and children, yet loyalty does not necessarily earn trust, nor filial piety love. The desire for ministers and children’s loyalty and filial piety lies within oneself. If the Dao has not yet reached the point of sighing and exhaustion, even what one desires within oneself remains an external thing that cannot be relied upon—how much less in others? Wu Yun, Chang Hong, and the rest clung to what lay in others, thus meeting death, grief, and sorrow. Blood turning to jade shows the utmost loyalty, yet it still could not be relied upon by those who desired loyalty—is this not lamentable?

When wood rubs against wood, fire arises—those of the same kind cannot avoid harming one another. When metal is held to fire, it melts—those of different kinds cannot avoid harming one another. From *"yin and yang clashing in their movements"* onward, it speaks of great calamity, inescapable between heaven and earth. Then there is quaking into thunder, bursting into light, harm arising from the different, or injury from the same, even to the point of the fire of life scorching harmony, and the moon being insufficient to overcome it. Alas! With a body, how can one be without care? Entangled in what is the same or different, one is doubly ensnared. The cicada’s wings fail to form, and its desires go unfulfilled. If the heart is suspended between heaven and earth, weighed down by distress and stagnation, it is like when yin and yang clash and heaven and earth are thrown into turmoil, or when profit and harm grind against one another and the fire of life burns fiercely—like when there is thunder and lightning, water and fire burning the locust tree. Even the moon’s clear and bright nature cannot overcome the fire scorching harmony. All this arises from having a heart. Sighing, then, is to let the heart go until it reaches the heartless—here, the Dao is exhausted.

**Yi Du’s Annotation:**
Within oneself, there is righteousness; in things, there is destiny. Righteousness has a path to cultivate, but destiny has no principle that can be relied upon. External things cannot be relied upon—this is spoken in terms of destiny. The loyalty and filial piety of ministers and children lie within oneself; seeking recognition for loyalty and filial piety from ruler and parent lies in things. Though external things cannot be relied upon, what lies within oneself must still be fulfilled with loyalty and filial piety. Those like Longfeng and Xiaoji, though unrecognized by ruler and parent, are examples. Not only were they not trusted or loved, but they ultimately met execution, grief, and sorrow. This unreliability is what the noble person cultivates in what lies within themselves, awaiting what lies in heaven.

When wood rubs against wood, fire is born; when fire is held to metal, the metal melts. Fire does not refrain from burning what it gives rise to, nor does metal lose its nature when scattered and released. The sage harmonizes yin and yang to govern heaven and earth. When yin and yang are in accord, heaven and earth are open, and wind and rain come in their time. Only when they are thrown into turmoil and blocked do thunder and lightning strike, and water and fire burn the locust tree. Water is meant to extinguish fire, yet it gives rise to fire that burns the locust—this is like today’s lightning. When the sage reaches destiny, they are not constrained by yin and yang, free from joy and sorrow in their midst. The common person clings to external things, so the five phases become thieves to them, yin and yang become bandits, and they are ensnared by joy and sorrow without escape. The cicada, in doubt and confusion, cannot accomplish its task. When things go as desired, there is comfort; when they go awry, there is distress. When encountering circumstances, one sinks; when touching things, one stagnates. Profit and harm clash in the breast, grinding and striking to produce inner heat—this is the fire of life scorching one’s harmony and nature, leaving it incomplete.

The moon is heaven’s yin; fire is man’s yang. Human desire blazes while heavenly principle wanes—this is what is meant by *"the moon cannot overcome the fire."* The discord of yin and yang and the five phases is summoned by human desire. Only by sighing and forgetting form beyond profit and harm is the Dao fully realized.

The *Bi Xu* Annotation states: The Dao abides within, while affairs involve the external—even what lies in oneself cannot be certain, let alone external things. If one takes benevolence and righteousness as certain, then Boyi and Shuqi would not have starved to death. If one takes wisdom as certain, then Bigan would not have had his heart carved out. If one takes loyalty as certain, then Wu Yun and Chang Hong would not have been executed. Here, the loyal and worthy, the sycophantic and fortunate, both fall into the same trap and cannot escape.

"Azure" is the color of sorrow; the heart governs blood, and loyal ministers, grieving for their state, transform their blood into azure. Wu Yun and Chang Hong knew to serve their lord with utmost loyalty but did not foresee that a rebellious ruler would bring disaster. Xiaoji and Zeng Shen knew to serve their parents with utmost filial piety but did not anticipate that parental suspicion would lead to sorrow. None of them understood the principle that external things cannot be certain.

E Lai obeyed Zhou and, joining in wickedness, could not avoid calamity—like wood grinding against wood. Long Feng defied Zhou, and though good and evil differ in nature, he still met execution—like metal and fire locked in conflict. When yin and yang move in disorder, heaven and earth are greatly shaken; when loyalty and filial piety are punished, the state collapses.

Loyalty and filial piety are what ministers and children ought to fulfill. Yet if, by misfortune, one encounters a benighted ruler or stubborn father—perverse in principle and violent in nature—it is like fire in water burning the great locust tree. As the *Huainanzi* says: "An old locust tree gives birth to fire." If one is loyal and remonstrates, sorrow befalls the minister; if one flatters and deceives, sorrow befalls the ruler.

All fell into the calamity of forced action, thus their sorrows multiplied and their aspirations could not be realized. Their hearts longed to rise high and shine between heaven and earth, yet the ways of the world were choked and obstructed, drowning them in stagnation, leaving no place to extend their efforts.

Loyalty and flattery clashed, grievances and resentments flared daily, and human harmony was consumed and cast aside. The sincerity of loyalty and filial piety is like the moon; the nature of violence and tyranny is like fire. The moon is inherently no match for it. Only those who are serene, unattached, and perfectly compliant fulfill the Way of loyalty and filial piety to its utmost.

As the *Yanzhai Oral Teachings* states: In the time of Jie and Zhou, the worthy and the unworthy alike suffered disaster—nothing was certain. When Chang Hong was exiled and returned to Shu, he disemboweled himself and died. The people of Shu stored his blood in a casket, and after three years, it transformed into green jade. When Emperor Yuan of Jin withheld grain supplies and executed his minister, the minister’s blood spurted upward to the rafters. When the Northern Qi emperor, known for his bright moon-like wisdom, killed Hulü Guang, his blood pooled on the ground and would not fade—all of these are of the same kind. Both Xiaoji and Zeng Shen suffered harm for their filial piety—nothing was certain.

Wood, by nature, has no fire, yet when rubbed together, it ignites. Metal, by nature, is extremely hard, yet when exposed to fire, it melts. All speak of the uncertainty of outcomes. The character *xian* (弦) means "different." During great thunderstorms, trees may be struck and burned—all such events arise from the disorder of yin and yang. "Two entrapments" refer to the human Way and the workings of yin and yang.

"Falling into ruin" describes a state of constant dread, the heart suspended as if bound, self-tormented by entanglement, drowned in stagnation. Advantage and harm wage war within, internal heat ignites, and the harmonious qi in the chest is scorched and dispersed. Human nature is originally like the moon, but when scorched by the smoke of worldly desires, its lunar essence cannot prevail.

"Serene and unattached" describes a state of effortless compliance. The Way is exhausted only when the principles of heaven are utterly extinguished. As Master Chu’s *Superficial Observations* notes: When external concerns weigh heavily, inner essence becomes light. What one gains, one loses. All worldly concerns—fame and defamation, success and failure, gain and loss—are not inherent to one’s nature and destiny; they are external things. Yet the common world mistakes them for truth, pursues them without return, and even destroys itself without awakening. Why? Because the prevailing winds of the world esteem nothing but profit and fame, and with them come slander, praise, honor, and disgrace.

Those of insight know that profit is filth and disdain to pursue it. Instead, they aspire to fame to elevate themselves. No fame is more esteemed than loyalty and filial piety, for they can guide ruler and parent to flawlessness and contribute to the state’s governance and the flourishing of teaching. If the customs of high antiquity were still pure, with rulers as carefree as branches and people as untamed as wild deer, how could there be acts of defying the ruler’s countenance or opposing his wrath? How could there be the threats of blades, saws, cauldrons, and boiling pots?

For a minister, misfortune lies in encountering a violent ruler who defies principle and monopolizes killing—this is a time when yin and yang are disordered and thunderbolts strike at random, and only then does loyalty manifest. For a child, misfortune lies in encountering a cruel father, driven to exile and hardship—this is a time when fire burns in water and scorches the locust tree, and only then does filial piety become known.

The locust tree’s color is a pure yellow, symbolizing the harmony within nature. Wood, as a thing, when wrung yields water, when drilled yields fire—it contains the nature of both yin and yang. Fire in water is yang encroaching upon yin’s domain. When it burns the locust tree, it is excessive and overbearing—how can harmony not be harmed?

The human body is born of yin and yang and stands upon balanced harmony. Yet when assailed by external things, qi stirs within, joy and anger surge, yin and yang contend, harmony diminishes daily, and pathogenic influences invade. How long can a rootless tree endure? "Two entrapments" refer to serving one’s ruler and honoring one’s parents externally, and cultivating oneself and nurturing life internally—neither escapes sorrow and exhaustion.

The heart is anxious and pressed, aspirations unfulfilled, as if suspended between heaven and earth with no means of escape. The character *wei* (慰) is difficult to interpret; it may be borrowed from *yu* (郁), and its sound and meaning are fairly clear. It describes being oppressed by thoughts and mired in desires, weighed down by attachment to things. Thus, advantage and harm wage war, internal fire attacks, and the harmonious qi is scorched and extinguished, giving rise to sorrow.

The qi of yin and yang moves through the great void without form; its mechanisms of expansion and contraction respond to human joy and anger. Alas, humans are most intelligent—how can they not cherish and guard themselves? Another analogy compares the moon’s brightness: though great, it wanes more than it waxes, for it follows the principles of heaven. Fire’s brightness, though small, burns ever more fiercely, for it arises from human action.

Heaven’s Way abhors fullness, and its waning is easily restored. Human endeavor favors flourishing, yet its flourishing easily declines. The moon cannot overcome fire—this is an analogy for human desires flourishing and the principles of heaven being extinguished. The moon waxes and wanes according to constant measure; when it wanes and then waxes again, what brightness is lost?

When fire blazes, it scorches the plains and lights up the sky, yet when its fuel is exhausted, only ashes and dust remain. There are ministers and children who fulfill the Way yet suffer hardship—this is how the fame of loyalty and filial piety is established, while the violent hasten their own destruction. Thus, though the body may not prevail against the force of violence, in principle it prevails, just as the moon’s form may not prevail against fire, yet its brightness does.

Alas, the fulfillment of loyalty and filial piety’s fame is the misfortune of ministers and children. As the *Dao De Jing* says: When the six relations are not in harmony, there are filial and compassionate children; when the state is in chaos, there are loyal ministers. How, then, should one conduct oneself? By being serene and unattached, and exhausting the Way.

To be serene and unattached and to exhaust the Way is to forget oneself and be transformed by things. Once self and things are forgotten, how can there be sorrow from internal fire scorching harmony? When Zhuang Zhou was poor, he went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River. The marquis said, "Very well. I will soon receive the taxes from my fief and will lend you three hundred pieces of gold—will that do?" Zhuang Zhou flushed with anger and said, "On my way here yesterday, I heard someone calling out from the middle of the road. I turned and saw a crucian carp in the rut of a cart wheel..."

When the crucian carp was asked, "What are you doing here?" it replied, "I am a wave-minister of the Eastern Sea. Might you have a斗 or a升 of water to keep me alive?" Zhuang Zhou said, "Very well. I am about to journey south to visit the kings of Wu and Yue, and I shall divert the waters of the Western River to welcome you—will that do?" The crucian carp flushed with anger and said, "I have lost my accustomed element, and I have nowhere to dwell. All I need is a斗 or a升 of water to stay alive, yet you speak of this! You might as well seek me now in the dried-fish market!"

Master Ren made a great hook and a thick black line, baited it with fifty steers, squatted on Mount Kuaiji, and cast his rod into the Eastern Sea. Day after day he fished, yet after a full year he caught nothing. Then a great fish took the bait, dragging the hook down in a sudden plunge, thrashing its fins and raising its tail. White waves rose like mountains, the sea waters churned, and the sound shook gods and spirits, startling all within a thousand *li*. Master Ren caught the fish, butchered it, and dried it into jerky. From Zhihe in the west to Cangwu in the north, there was none who did not feast on it.

Yet later generations—those of shallow talent who recite petty sayings—were all astonished and spread the tale. Those who brandish their rods in the shallows, rush to irrigate the marshes, or cling to worn-out doctrines may find it hard to catch great fish. Those who embellish trivial words to seek petty office are far from true attainment. Thus, they have never heard of Master Ren’s way, and they are far from governing the age.

Guo’s commentary: When Zhuangzi sought grain, his words were reasonable, without petty calculation. If they were not, what use would greatness be? The chapter on Master Ren shows that aspirations differ, and the proper way to govern the age varies accordingly.

Lü’s commentary: When Zhuangzi sought grain, he made clear that those who nurture life seek only to sustain themselves and do not strive for excess. When Master Ren fished, he showed that those who govern the age aim for great accomplishment and do not expect immediate results.

Yi Du’s commentary: To relieve another’s urgency, one must act in time. The Marquis of the River’s promise to lend Zhuangzi gold from his fief came too late. Thus, the crucian carp in the rut serves as a metaphor: the marquis did not grasp Zhuangzi’s urgency, just as Zhuangzi did not grasp the fish’s. The lord of Ren’s state made a great hook and thick line, showing his intent to undertake great deeds. The bait was a barren cow. When the great fish took it, its thrashing startled all within a thousand *li*—this shows that those with far-reaching aspirations may achieve late, but their impact shakes the world. When Master Ren caught the fish, there was none from Zhihe to Cangwu who did not feast on it, illustrating that great achievements benefit all under heaven. Later generations’ astonishment and retelling show that those with far-reaching aspirations, when they succeed in the world, leave their names to posterity—like Yi Yin and the Grand Duke. Minnows and petty officials are not where greatness is sought.

The *Bixu Annotation* states: "Constant companionship" refers to those who are close. Fish and water are always intimate, but now they are parted, so there is no place of rest. When a man is cold, clothing is needed; when hungry, food is needed. To channel the river’s waters to welcome the stranded fish—is this not too late? Offering a thousand gold to a tiger is not as good as a single shoulder of meat. When Lord Ren cast his great hook and thick line and caught the great fish after a year’s time, those in the world who lightly assess others and mockingly discuss affairs heard of this custom. Startled by the strange thing, they told one another—this is a metaphor that shallow learners cannot be entrusted with discussing the great enterprises of governing the age.

The "rod" (as in *ganlei*, pronounced in level tone) refers to the heavy rod of thorn bamboo, and the "line" to the silk thread. "County" (pronounced in level tone) means high, referring to lofty fame and reputation. *Yanqi’s Oral Exegesis* states: "Fief gold" is the tax revenue from a feudal estate. "Wave minister" is like a water official. "Constant companionship" means those who are always together. "Light talent" means to assess and measure. "Mocking discourse" is like groundless talk. "Lei" is a small cord. The proclamations of "county" (pronounced in departing tone) are like reward notices. To adorn trivial words to seek favor from superiors, hoping to match the standards they set—how much can one truly gain?

The character "custom" belongs to the next sentence, meaning "the scholars of the vulgar world." The *Marquis of Jianhe* in the *Garden of Stories* is written as the *Marquis of Wei Wen*; "call" (pronounced in departing tone) should be the character "xu" (also in departing tone), meaning "to deceive." "Fen" refers to the *ji* fish. "Wave minister" in the old annotation means "a minister tossed by waves." The kings of Wu and Yue are rather difficult to explain; most interpretations omit them. Only *Bixu* states: Wu and Yue are lands of water and fruit, and their kings are like rivers and seas, lords of all valleys. In Zhang Junfang’s collated edition, the character "you" is followed by "shuo" (pronounced in departing tone), but his argument is still unclear. After examining the meaning and textual variants, the general idea is roughly grasped. The character "king" was originally a "tu" (土) with an erroneous stroke added at the top—this explanation is quite concise.

The general meaning of this passage is that a person abiding in the Dao is like a fish in water and cannot be separated even for a moment. If one loses the Dao in oneself and seeks it externally, it is like hoping for the fief gold of the Marquis of Jianhe—how can this address the urgency of the present? The great hook and thick line are metaphors for wielding great means, and thus one’s gains are abundant. "Lei" should be written as "lei" (缧), meaning fishing line. The character "custom" under "wind" is redundant, resulting from a scribal error. This means that one who upholds the Dao for a long time and sees its effects cannot be demanded for immediate results. Yet when cultivation is complete and its implementation is seen, its blessings extend to the myriad things—how could it be limited to merely the regions from the Huai River to the north of Cangwu? The four characters "fen yu xia fen ran zuo se" (纷鱼下忿然作色) are a repeated scribal error.

"County" (in level tone) is better explained as referring to lofty fame and reputation.

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu, on "External Things" (Chapter Two)

The Confucians use the *Odes* and *Rites* to rob graves. A great Confucian proclaims to his followers: "The east is stirring—how goes the matter?" A lesser Confucian replies: "The shroud has not yet been loosened, but there is a pearl in the mouth." The *Odes* indeed contain this verse: "The green, green wheat grows on the hillside mound. If one did not give in life, why hold a pearl in death?" Grasping the hair, twisting the skull, the Confucian uses a metal mallet to strike the jaw, carefully prying apart the cheeks—without harming the pearl in the mouth.

Guo’s commentary: The *Odes* and *Rites* are the transmitted teachings of the former kings. If the person is unworthy, the Way cannot be practiced in vain. Thus, Confucians may employ them for deceit, proving that traces alone cannot be relied upon.

Lü’s commentary: Petty Confucians draw upon the words of the former kings to further their own injustice—how is this different?

Yi Du’s commentary: The age of the former kings is long past. Confucians exploit their traces to commit robbery, even to the point of grave-robbing. Yet they cite lost poems to mock the deceased, using both to justify taking the pearl from the mouth. The traces of benevolence and righteousness are vast, so Tian Dan used them to usurp a state. The traces of the *Odes* and *Books* are small, so Confucians use them to rob graves. From the traces of the *Odes* and *Rites* expanding to benevolence and righteousness, or from the mind of grave-robbing expanding to state-usurpation—one cannot but be vigilant.

Bixu’s commentary: The *Odes* guide the will; the *Rites* guide affairs. Both transmit teachings to support the Way of governance. The noble man upholds the *Odes* and *Rites* to cultivate himself; the petty man recites the *Odes* and *Rites* to commit theft. Noble men are few, petty men many—thus the traces of the sages benefit the world little and harm it much. Thieves do not dig up the graves of Boyi and Shuqi but must open the tombs of Jie and Zhou—there is a reason for this. Hence, "excessive hoarding invites great loss" is the profound warning of Laozi.

*Yanzhai Oral Teachings*: This metaphor refers to the wandering persuaders of the time, who borrowed the words of sages to embellish their deceit. "Proclaiming from above to below" is called *lu*. The *lu* transmitter is the great Confucian who speaks first to inform those below.

The verdant wheat in two lines eulogizes the grave-field,
The next two lines satirize the wealthy—an ancient lost poem.
Touching his temples and descending,
It teaches to take the pearl from the mouth without harm.

The *Odes* and *Rites* serve the world
To rectify the Way of governance and stem its excesses,
Proceeding alongside the law,
Enabling people to rise and establish themselves.
Sages do not appear in every age,
Thus their foresight runs deep,
Striving to wholly reform the world’s ills.
Emerging from ritual, one must enter the law;
Where ritual is fulfilled, the law may be abolished.
The sage’s heart is fundamentally empty—
Yet how can the decadent customs of a declining age
Exploit their traces for deceit?
To the point of robbing graves without remorse—
This harms not only the living,
But even the dead cannot rest in their graves!
How can one fully recount the poison of its spread?
And yet they still cite the *Odes* to admonish—
This is doing what ought not be done,
Using what ought not be used.

Zhuangzi’s lament for the world was earnest,
Yet he could effect no change,
So he resorted to oblique metaphors to convey his meaning.
As for Lu’s reputation for many Ru,
When one examines the reality, only one was truly a Ru—
Thus this chapter is not spoken in vain.
It aims to condemn their hearts and correct their teachings,
To make them do what the *Odes* and *Rites* demand,
Fulfilling all that Ru conduct should fulfill.
It further serves as a warning against lavish burials,
Reviving the simple and honest customs of later ages.
Raising the net’s headrope, all its meshes align—
How could this not greatly benefit the Way of governance?

When Lao Lai’s disciple went out to gather firewood,
He encountered Confucius and returned to report:
“There is someone over there—
Tall above, hastening below,
His eyes like one scheming for all under heaven,
Yet I know not whose son he is.”
Lao Lai said: “That is Qiu.”
He summoned him to come.
Confucius arrived.
Lao Lai said: “Qiu, cast off your bodily pride and your cultivated wisdom—
Only then can you be a noble man!”
Confucius bowed and withdrew,
His expression altered as he asked:
“May I inquire about the path of my work?”
Lao Lai said: “To be unable to bear the world’s wounds,
Yet rush toward the calamities of ten thousand generations—
Is this not stubbornly clinging to what is precious?
Or has your strategy fallen short?
Kindness that startles with false delight
Becomes a lifelong disgrace—
This is merely the conduct of the mediocre,
Drawn together by fame, bound by concealment.
Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie,
It is better to forget both and seal off what you praise.
To turn back is not without harm;
To act is not without wrong.
The sage hesitates to initiate affairs,
Yet each endeavor succeeds.
Alas!
Why must you persist in your pride?”

Guo’s Commentary:
It is merely the superior hastening the inferior. Yet afterward, the branches tower over the root. Gazing at him, one sees a puppet-like figure, as though managing another’s affairs—this is to say, he can cast off form and abandon knowledge, and thus be deemed a noble man. Bowing and withdrawing, he receives his words. The question is posed to make Lao Lai clarify the impossibility of following such a path. If one acts for a single generation, then the paths of ten thousand generations become blocked. If one simply allows things to take their course, the people’s nature will not be impoverished but will all possess their own, and there will be no matter beyond one’s strategy. To bestow kindness that startles with delight—without kindness, there is disgrace; yet kindness cannot be prolonged, so a single act of kindness brings lifelong shame. To speak of following such a path is to say one must not recklessly bestow kindness. "Concealment" refers to binding one’s traces. To follow is to preserve wholeness; to be still is to attain correctness. Affairs do not stray from their root, and thus his endeavors always succeed. Pride cannot be borne, so he abandons it and does not claim it as his own.

Lü’s Commentary:
Laozi and Confucius were originally without conflict, yet those who study Confucius in later ages cling to his traces and fail to grasp his heart; thus Zhuangzi offers this discourse. From "the superior hastening the inferior" to "whose disciple is this?"—these describe those who seek the sage by his appearance. "Pride in one’s person" refers to the demeanor of one who practices and exalts himself. "Knowledge" is not the abundant virtue of one who seems foolish. Great chaos arose between Yao and Shun, yet now, unable to bear the wounds of a single generation, one acts to save it—this is to rush toward the calamities of ten thousand generations. Is the enterprise of abundance inherently impoverished? Or has one’s strategy fallen short? Neither is the case. Kindness is not great wisdom, yet to take delight in it as though rushing toward joy brings lifelong disgrace—one would still refrain from such acts. As for those who draw one another by fame and bind one another by concealment, these are merely the conduct of the mediocre. How much less should a noble man who embodies the Dao act thus? Even they cannot utterly cast aside sagely knowledge, forget both good and evil, and yet still rush toward the calamities of ten thousand generations. The Dao does nothing that is not action, yet to turn back is to invite harm; to act is to invite wrong. How can there be anything worthy of praise? To hesitate like one crossing a river in winter, to be cautious as though fearing one’s four neighbors—this is what is meant by "hesitating." Why must one bear it and claim it, believing that without pride it cannot be attained?

Yi Du’s Commentary:
"Branches towering" describes a back slightly bent, leaning forward. "Behind the ears" is the mark of a noble person. To gaze as though managing the four seas is to say one’s vision is broad and selfless. "Pride in one’s person and display of knowledge" means one has not yet been able to leave no trace in the world. "May the path of my work be followed?" refers to following the traces of the Dao. As for benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom—these are what the sage, unable to bear the suffering of a single generation, enacts to save his time. Yet later ages rely on these remnants, turning them into harm. To govern the world by sagely traces is to cause people to be oppressed and humiliated, leading to obstinacy and poverty, forgetting the principle of simplicity and failing to attain the true Dao. To bestow kindness that startles with delight—without kindness, there is disgrace. The mediocre are of a nature that can rise or fall; if they follow traces, they ascend—why must one bestow kindness? Kindness is what petty men cherish, so the noble man does not adopt it. "Drawing one another" refers to chasing fame; "binding one another" refers to delighting in concealment. Chasing fame is to align with the people’s calamities; delighting in concealment is to fulfill one’s own desires—both are partial and thus belong to the mediocre. To forget both and seal off what one praises is to have neither affirmation nor denial. Human nature, when turned against, is harmed; when followed, is preserved. When moved, it strays; when still, it is correct. To hesitate is not to rush, and thus one follows the principles of nature and destiny, always succeeding. To seek speed is not to reach one’s goal. Confucius bore the Dao and acted in his time, yet in the end displayed pride, so Lao Lai admonished him with these words.

Bi Xu’s Commentary:
"Pride in one’s person" refers to his desire to expose filth; "display of knowledge" refers to his intent to startle the foolish—thus he is instructed to abandon both. The wounds of a single generation are a matter of fate; to endure them is to escape temporarily. The calamities of ten thousand generations are a matter of traces; to act with arrogance and alarm is to fail to save them. He further inquired of Confucius: having traveled and suffered hardship, did he uphold the Dao so firmly that he ended in poverty? Or did his strategies and undertakings fall short? To take delight in kindness and startle others is what the sage finds shameful. The nature of the mediocre is easily led: in times of order, they draw one another toward fame; in times of chaos, they bind one another in retreat. Confucius, in his confusion and actions, praised Yao and condemned Jie—if sagely traces were obliterated, what would there be to praise or blame? To follow the world is not to oppose it, and thus one preserves oneself; to be still in contemplation is not to be disturbed, and thus one attains correctness. The sage acts with ease in the Dao, and his achievements naturally succeed; even when they do, he does not claim them—how much less when they do not? To forget words is to be without encumbrance; to bear records is to pride oneself on fame.

Yan Zhai’s Oral Teachings:
"Branches" means slight; it describes a back slightly curved. To gaze as though managing the four seas is to look upon the world with concern. "Pride in one’s person" refers to the demeanor of one who exalts himself in conduct; "knowledge" refers to thought and deliberation. "Startle" is akin to arrogance. Given this, you are right to be impoverished. To draw one another by fame and bind one another in schemes of concealment—these are the acts of mediocre men. To forget both Yao and Jie is to be without praise or blame. To turn back is to go against the principles of nature; to act without stillness is to invite nothing but wrong and perversion. The sage acts only when unavoidable, and thus always succeeds. How can you bear pride and take it as your own? Lao Lai’s disciple described the Master’s appearance in three phrases, with the last seeming to capture the heart of the sage. Without eyes that transcend the dust, one could not easily speak of this—it resembles the words of the gatekeeper Qiu Zhang describing Master Wen. Yet his teacher already understood him; the hearts of sages and worthies commune with the divine in this way. "Pride in one’s person" means to make one’s whole body a display of boasting; "demeanor" refers to an air of arrogance; "knowledge" refers to excessive scheming.

All these are sufficient to invite calamity, hence the need to abandon them. *Jing* (驚), here written as *wu* (骛), signifies distress—unable to bear the suffering of the age, one acts with benevolence and righteousness to rescue it. Later generations, clinging to traces, fall into corruption, racing onward without cease.

Yet was he truly so resolute in poverty as to hold the world in light regard? Or did he lack the foresight to consider this? Why then did his eagerness to bestow kindness manifest so visibly, impossible to conceal?

This is a rebuke of the Master’s restless travels and embassies, which exhausted his body and spirit—nothing but reckless haste. A lifetime of disgrace! Such are the tracks of the common folk. Where there are tracks, men vie for fame; where there is retreat, they bind themselves in seclusion. Praise for Yao and blame for Jie arise from this. If both were forgotten, how could Yao and Jie be distinguished?

*Fan* (反) means to return to what was said before. Those who cannot forget both praise and blame harbor love and hatred within, harming both themselves and others. *Dong* (动) means lacking inner constancy. Those who delight in praise and resent blame follow the whims of things, their conduct straying into perversion.

Thus the sage waits for the right moment to act, proceeding slowly to undertake affairs, and so always succeeds. How could one bear to take pride in one’s abilities, yet ultimately fail to escape self-importance?

The Master and Lao Lai—one emerged to serve Yao, the other withdrew like Xu You—were but parables in the *Nanhua*, meant to warn a world that, not knowing the times, forces action to seek renown. This is no true censure.

The Lord of Song dreamed in the dead of night of a man with disheveled hair peering through the side gate, who said: *"I come from Zailu’s deep, sent by the Clear River as an envoy to the River Lord. The fisherman Yu Ju caught me."* The Lord awoke and had the dream interpreted. *"This is a divine turtle!"* he was told.

The Lord asked: *"Is there a fisherman named Yu Ju?"*
His attendants replied: *"There is."*
The Lord said: *"Summon Yu Ju to court."*

The next day, Yu Ju appeared.
The Lord asked: *"What did you catch?"*
Yu Ju answered: *"My net snared a white turtle, five feet in circumference."*
The Lord said: *"Present your turtle."*

When the turtle arrived, the Lord wavered—first wanting to kill it, then to spare it. Doubtful, he consulted the oracle, which said: *"Slaying the turtle for divination will bring good fortune."* So they split the turtle open, drilling seventy-two holes without a single miscast.

Confucius said: *"The divine turtle could appear in the Lord’s dream but could not escape Yu Ju’s net. Though it knew how to divine seventy-two times without error, it could not avoid the disaster of having its entrails torn out. Thus, even knowledge has its limits, and the divine has its blind spots. Though one may possess supreme wisdom, ten thousand schemers may still outmaneuver it."*

The fish fears not the net but the pelican.
Abandon petty knowledge, and great wisdom will become clear; abandon contrived goodness, and true goodness will arise of itself.
An infant, though born without a stern teacher, can speak—by dwelling among those who can speak.

Guo’s Annotation: The insufficiency of the divine is thus—only by abiding in stillness within one’s capacity, without scheming beyond, can one remain whole. To employ one’s own wisdom while relying on the schemes of many is like a net without intent, thus catching fish.
Petty knowledge is self-serving; great wisdom entrusts itself to things. Abandon contrived goodness, and there will be nothing to covet; with nothing to covet, one will not grow arrogant but will be good of itself.
To float freely without practice and yet possess ability is not to strain toward learning from others.

Lü’s Annotation: Though the turtle possesses knowledge, it cannot escape harm; though it has divinity, it cannot evade the net—this is what it means to be constrained, to have limits.
Thus, those who follow the Dao sever sageliness and discard knowledge. Even with supreme wisdom, ten thousand schemers may outmaneuver it; the few cannot overcome the many, for their nature is thus.

The fish fears not the net but the pelican—because the pelican has intent, while the net has none.
Therefore, abandon petty knowledge, and great wisdom will become clear; abandon contrived goodness, and true goodness will arise. Then how can a ruler rely on knowledge to govern?
An infant, though without a stern teacher, can speak—if one dwells among the people with cunning, can one prevent them from knowing?

Yi Du’s Annotation: To discern the fortune and misfortune of others is the turtle’s knowledge. To be disemboweled yet retain its numen is the turtle’s divinity. Yet it could not escape Yu Ju’s net nor avoid the Lord’s calamity—thus, knowledge has its limits, and the divine has its blind spots.
The sage gathers the goodness of all people and unites the wisdom of the world, thus becoming supremely wise.
Only by being without intent toward things can one attain them—thus, the fish fears not the net but the pelican.

Abandon petty knowledge, and wisdom will encompass all things; abandon petty goodness, and goodness will flow from one’s nature.
An infant, without a teacher, can speak—gradually influenced without awareness, how could this be sought through knowledge?

Bi Xu’s Annotation: The turtle’s seventy-two divinations and the numbers eight and nine—hence Guan Ziming’s *Yi Zhuan* takes seventy-two as the measure of the calendar. The toad repels weapons yet cannot escape the slaughter of midsummer; the rooster crows at dawn yet cannot flee the cauldron’s fate. What is numinous in one regard must be dull in another—this is what it means for knowledge to have limits and the divine to have blind spots.
The multitude’s schemes multiply with knowledge; the fish fears what has intent.
To abandon the knowledge of others and cultivate one’s own clarity; to forsake goodness that strays from the Dao and preserve the goodness of self-wholeness—this is to draw near the Dao.

An infant’s simplicity gradually scatters by dwelling among those who can speak. Once it can speak, it distinguishes right and wrong, and profit and harm arise.

*Yanzhai Oral Teachings*: "Amen," the crooked and narrow gate. To name it as knowledge is to invite its exhaustion.
Even one with supreme wisdom—how can they overcome the schemes of ten thousand?

The pelican harms fish with intent—no net compares. I have intent, and so do others; if one can relinquish petty knowledge and entrust all to spontaneity, then great knowledge becomes luminous. Abandon the impulse to name one’s goodness, and goodness will return of itself.

The stone (同 *shuo*, "vast")—a vast teacher can instruct others, yet an infant speaks without instruction: both are metaphors for spontaneity. *Zailu* is the name of a deep pool, the dwelling of the divine turtle. When it serves as the emissary of the Clear River to the River Lord, it is enslaved by knowledge, descending from purity into turbidity—thus it cannot escape exhaustion. Yet it may still appear in dreams to the Primordial Sovereign, for its numinous spirit is not extinguished.

The turtle is a yin creature with a carapace, its white color corresponding to yang; its shell spans five feet, aligning with the Five Phases. When divination by killing the turtle yields auspicious omens, it reveals that its signs are not for private gain—though it brings no benefit to itself, it manifests numinosity for others. Seventy-two drillings leave no crack unread: its substance is exquisite, perfectly attuned to celestial patterns. Yet when it enters the net, it cannot escape; when its entrails are carved out, it cannot avoid its fate. Its spirit and knowledge have their limits—none of these can be relied upon.

Had it not served as the Clear River’s emissary but dragged its tail through the mud, preserving the knowledge of non-knowledge and the spirit of non-spirit, this would be the acme of wisdom and numinosity. Then what fear would it have of nets and snares?

This passage resembles the *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on Turtles and Divination*, though there the fisherman is named Yu Ju, the same figure here. Thus, even one of supreme wisdom must guard against the schemes of the multitude, which may prevail, and dare not rely entirely on their own power. The schemes of the many are no different from the pelican’s predation of fish—not like a net, which is mindless and can be evaded.

To avoid calamity, one must discard one’s own dim and petty knowledge and adopt the collective counsel as wisdom. Then great clarity will pervade all things, and by forsaking one’s own goodness, the world’s goodness will return to them. Like an infant dwelling among those who can speak, in time they transform together, unaware of how or why it comes to pass.

*Collected Explications of the Ocean of Meanings in the True Scripture of the Southern Florescence*, Scrolls 88–89

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu, *Outer Things* (Chapter Three)

Hui Zi said to Zhuangzi: "Your words are useless."
Zhuangzi replied: "Only when one knows the useless can one speak of the useful. The earth is neither narrow nor small, yet what man uses of it is only enough to stand upon. If, however, one were to dig beneath one’s feet to the Yellow Springs, would that space still be of use?"
Hui Zi said: "It would be useless."
Zhuangzi said: "Thus the usefulness of the useless is made clear."

Zhuangzi said: "Can one who is capable of wandering choose not to wander? Can one who is incapable of wandering force themselves to wander? The will that drifts with the current, the conduct that cuts off all ties—alas, are these not beyond the capacity of one of supreme wisdom and profound virtue? To fall and not return, to rush like fire and not look back—though they may serve as ruler and minister to one another, it is but a matter of time. When the age changes, they will have no means to hold one another in contempt. Thus the perfected person does not drift with the current.

Those who revere the ancient and despise the present are but followers of the scholars. Moreover, if one views the present age through the lens of the men of Xi Wei’s time, who could remain unmoved by its waves? Only the perfected person can wander through the world without becoming eccentric, adapting to others without losing themselves. They teach without instructing, and respond to others’ intentions without being bound by them."

Guo’s commentary: "The sage responds from within, acting in accord with the moment; their words arise externally, flowing with the circumstances. When circumstances flow smoothly, affairs are unobstructed; when the external is clear, the internal is put to use—such is the principle of mutual necessity. What one’s nature can do, one cannot but do; what one’s nature cannot do, one cannot force. Only when nothing restrains it do all things attain their due, though they know not how they attain it. Without virtue of the utmost depth, none can uphold their will and conduct or trust in their extraordinary abilities.

What people love, they do not shun, be it right or wrong; life and death alike are embraced, and when the age changes, none can hold another in contempt—this is the great equality. Only by meeting each moment and following it can one move with transformation. Yet scholars revere the ancient and despise the present, losing sight of the source and allowing things to each preserve their own self."

Lü’s commentary: "Worldly sentiment deems those with knowledge and ability as useful, and those without as useless, not realizing that the useless is the very source of the useful. From the perspective of the Dao, what the world calls knowledge and ability—how small is their use compared to the space one’s feet occupy upon the earth! As *Liezi* says: 'The supreme wanderer knows not where they go; the supreme observer knows not what they see. Every thing wanders, every thing observes. This is what I call wandering, what I call observing.' Zhuangzi’s wandering is no different.

For one who has attained the Dao, there is nothing that is not the Dao—thus every thing wanders, every thing observes. Even if they wished not to wander, they could not. But one who has not attained the Dao, though they may wish to wander, cannot. The will that drifts and flees follows custom and becomes base; the conduct that cuts off all ties withdraws from the world and becomes lofty. Neither is the task of one of supreme wisdom and profound virtue, for both are obscured by partiality. To the point of falling and not returning, rushing like fire and not looking back—though they may serve as ruler and minister for a time, it is but a matter of circumstance. When the age changes, none can hold another in contempt, for their deviation from the Dao is the same.

One of supreme wisdom and profound virtue does not become base through drifting nor lofty through cutting ties, but simply follows the Dao. Thus the perfected person does not drift with the current, leaving no trace. If one reveres the ancient and despises the present, viewing the present age through the degeneracy of Xi Wei’s time, how can their heart remain calm and unwavering? Only the perfected person can wander through the world without eccentric conduct, externally adapting to others while inwardly not losing themselves. They respond to others and teach them, yet it is not instruction; they grasp others’ intentions and follow them, yet do not become bound to them.

What they teach is what the other already possesses, not something foreign imposed upon them. If one cannot comprehend the intentions of all under heaven, then 'this' and 'that' arise. But if one grasps their intentions and follows them, where is the 'other'? This is the wandering of the perfected person."

Yi Du’s commentary: "The use of the useful is as a vessel; the use of the useless is as the Dao. Vessels have limits, and their use is small. The Dao is boundless, and its use is great. Zhuangzi’s discourse on the Dao is vast and expansive, so Hui Zi doubted its usefulness. He was told that only by knowing the useless could one speak of the useful. It is like walking upon the earth, though it is vast, what one uses is only enough for one’s feet. Beyond that, one fears sinking and dares not proceed—thus the usefulness of the useless is made clear. The *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter’s discussion of the great gourds and great trees shares this meaning.

To wander is to move or rest as one pleases, at ease. All people possess this ease by nature; whether one can or cannot depends on learning or not learning. Through learning, one returns to the root and can wander. Though one may not strive for external appearances, there is nothing that is not at ease—this is the ability to wander. Without learning, one is obscured by things; though one may strive daily for external appearances, they cannot be at ease.

To drift is to chase after things without returning; to flee is to shrink back without advancing. To cut off is to act decisively; to erase one’s traces is to obliterate one’s path—all are fixated on one side. If one takes this as wisdom, there will be things one does not know; if one takes this as virtue, there will be things one cannot bear. Thus the spirit falls and does not recover, the heart races like fire and does not look back. Though they may serve as ruler and minister for a time, it is merely coincidence—what is noble or base? The perfected person simply follows where they go, meeting each moment and adapting to it, without lingering. If one views the present age from the time before the Three Sovereigns, who would not be swept up in its waves? Only the perfected person wanders with the world, acting from their natural disposition, thus able to adapt to things without losing themselves.

They teach when others come to them, yet never make a study of it; they follow others’ intentions and respond, yet do not take them as 'other.'"

The *Inner Chapters* states: "If they become infants, then join them as an infant—this is right." Master Bixu annotates: People regard the space beyond their leaping bounds as useless ground, yet if one were to dig downward to the Yellow Springs, leaving only room for one’s feet, they could not take even a single dignified step. It is like planting crops—only with ample open space can they flourish. Thus the usefulness of the seemingly useless becomes clear.

For one who roams and studies the Dao, it is the nature of their being—how could they be made not to roam? For one who cannot roam and study the Dao, it is also the nature of their being—how could they be forced to roam? The world does not know its own measure, recklessly pursuing drifting, fleeing, and escaping. Those who act with resolute distinction, striving for lofty heights through sheer will, all fail to follow the path of supreme wisdom and profound virtue.

"Falling and collapsing" refers to abandoning study and neglecting one’s work. "Racing like fire" describes those who toil in study yet gain no progress, each chasing their own pursuits without looking back, merely taking turns as ruler and minister in their time. What distinction of noble or base is there? Only the perfected person acts with principle in their comings and goings, following their own aspirations.

Yet scholars value the distant and disregard the near—this flaw has persisted for ages. Viewing the present age from the time of the ancient sages, who is not swept up in its waves, losing their true nature? The perfected person moves with the world’s rise and fall, responding outwardly to things while inwardly preserving their authenticity. What others teach need not be learned as worldly ways, yet one may follow their intent without treating them as separate. This is how one remains whole in the world—this is called "roaming."

*The Oral Teachings of Yanzhai* states: "Dian" means to dig. If beyond the space for one’s feet lies only a deep abyss, one cannot walk—hence the usefulness of the useless, the joy of the roamer. Some can, some cannot—this illustrates those who attain and those who do not. "Drifting and fleeing" means chasing after things. "Resolute distinction" means setting oneself apart. The person of supreme wisdom and profound virtue cultivates naturalness and acts without contrivance.

"Falling and collapsing" means sinking into delusion. Worldly affairs race like fire in pursuit of profit and fame—these are all those who cannot turn back. Though there may be distinctions of ruler and minister, noble and base in their time, what remains after their bodies perish? Only the perfected person acts without attachment to the world, seeing past and present as one. Scholars revere antiquity and despise the present, unaware of the world’s changes. Viewing today from the vantage of high antiquity, all appear as those swept up in waves, losing their nature.

To roam the world without eccentricity is not to judge by past or present. To follow others without losing oneself is to blend outwardly with the world while inwardly preserving something. What others teach, they deem correct—I need not learn it, yet I follow their intent without division between self and other. This is the meaning of "equalizing things" in the *Qi Wu Lun*.

"Roaming" means wandering freely in the realm of the useless, fulfilling the great use of preserving oneself. Only those who attain the Dao can do this. Those who can do so cannot but roam; those who cannot should not be forced. Most of the world drifts and flees in pursuit of things, while others adopt resolute, lofty conduct, rigid and unyielding, seeing the world as a trap or snare. Some even drown themselves with stones or burn to death clinging to trees—how can they hope for carefree roaming? Thus, none of these follow the path of supreme wisdom and profound virtue. Most stumble and race after fame and profit to console their hearts.

Though distinctions of ruler and minister may exist for a time, if circumstances change, there is no basis for noble or base. Only the Dao is honored throughout the world; those who defy it cannot gain esteem. Thus, the perfected person lets things flow without obstruction, roaming together with the single qi of heaven and earth. Past and present follow a constant principle—if I can transform things, I may turn the present into antiquity. Why value the ear and disparage the eye, falsely distinguishing noble and base?

Moreover, viewing the present age from high antiquity, who is not swept up in its waves? Forgetting past and present, roaming the world without eccentric conduct, following others without losing oneself—taking the hearts of the many as one’s own heart, one’s own heart is fulfilled. This is called "turning the present into antiquity"—what noble or base is there? When Confucius told Ran Qiu that the past is like the present, this was his meaning.

Thus, when people come to learn, one teaches according to their nature, not forcing what they cannot do. One follows their intent without treating them as separate. In this way, past and present, self and others roam together as one. Though separated by ten thousand years, ten thousand miles, or ten thousand people, it is no different from gathering in the same hall or sharing the same seat at Master Zhuang’s gate, delighting in the Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.

This describes how the perfected person engages with the world: not only can they roam freely in the Dao, but they can also roam together with all things. Thus they unify the hundred kings under one Dao, harmonizing ten thousand generations into purity.

Eyes that penetrate are called clarity; ears that penetrate are called acuity; noses that penetrate are called sensitivity; mouths that penetrate are called sweetness; minds that penetrate are called wisdom; wisdom that penetrates is called virtue. The Dao does not desire obstruction—obstruction leads to choking, and if choking persists without cease, it causes damage, from which many harms arise.

Living things rely on breath, and if it is not smooth, it is not heaven’s fault. Heaven pierces them day and night without ceasing, yet people block their own openings. The womb has its layered chambers, and the mind has its celestial roaming. If a room has no empty space, mother and daughter-in-law will quarrel; if the mind has no celestial roaming, the six senses will clash.

The great forests and mountains are good for people, yet even the spirit cannot prevail. Virtue overflows into fame, fame overflows into excess, schemes rely on knowledge, knowledge arises from contention, rigidity grows from clinging, official duties are settled by the needs of the many, and when spring rains come in season, plants and trees flourish vigorously. Weeding and hoeing begin then, and more than half of the plants and trees that should be cultivated are lost without knowing why.

Guo Xiang annotates: When what should flow is blocked, principles cannot be released and trample one another.

All rooted beings possess no knowledge, nor do they rely on breath. *Yin* means "proper." Breath does not arise from knowledge; only through knowledge does one lose propriety, and losing propriety leads to obstruction. Thus, knowledge relies on breath, but breath does not rely on knowledge. Yet when knowledge is employed by desire, it is called "human"—not the tally of inevitability.

The heavenly principle operates in constant motion; when emotions do not interfere and one follows heaven, the apertures open. *Lang* means "spacious." *You* means "unfettered." *Boqi* refers to quarrels. *Rang* means "conflict." The natural principle finds passage through things. When fame is lofty, profit runs deep—thus those who cultivate virtue exceed what is proper. To suppress violence is to make fame surpass virtue. Urgency then compels the weighing of schemes. When all is at peace, knowledge serves no use. *Chai* means "blockage." Official duties are established because the many have disparate needs.

The arising of all things has its cause; affairs emerge from principle, so one remains unaware. Lü’s annotation: If the human ear, eye, nose, and mouth are not obstructed by sounds, colors, scents, and flavors, they become keen, bright, fragrant, and sweet. If knowledge and virtue are obstructed, they choke and fail to flow. When obstruction grows severe, they trample one another, and gain and loss wage war in the breast—how long before they lead to ruin? This is how the afflictions of yin and yang arise and the myriad harms are born.

All sentient beings live when breath abides and die when breath departs. The ebb and flow of breath follow the cycles of *zi* and *wu*, moving left and right with yin and yang, ceaselessly communing with primordial *qi*—this is heaven’s piercing and opening. Day and night are balanced, never diminishing, yet people obstruct their apertures with sounds, colors, scents, and flavors, preventing their flow—hence their decline and failure to remain proper.

If one can be tranquil, empty, and desireless, true *qi* will follow; if the body is aligned and perception unified, heavenly harmony will arrive. Thus, the womb has layered chambers, firmly encircling life’s purity, so that no filth may invade; the mind has celestial roaming, free and unburdened, so that no affairs may disturb it. A room must have empty space to distinguish hierarchy—otherwise, mother and daughter-in-law will bicker and quarrel. The mind must have celestial roaming to rise above the dust—otherwise, the six apertures will clash and conflict. The six apertures are the ear, eye, nose, mouth, mind, and knowledge.

If one truly understands celestial roaming, though dwelling in the human world, no thing can disturb the heart, and the spirit is sufficient to prevail. Why praise great forests and mountains as good? Supreme virtue does not act as virtue, thus it has no fame. When fame exists, virtue overflows and becomes excess, and fame itself overflows—then schemes must rely on persuasion, knowledge must emerge from contention, and blockage must arise from clinging. This is how affairs are settled by the needs of the many. Sounds, colors, scents, and flavors block the exterior, while thoughts, worries, knowledge, and schemes block the interior, preventing mutual flow.

The cultivation of the Daoist’s mind governs it before disorder arises—better than waiting for plants and trees to flourish wildly before weeding and hoeing. Du’s annotation: *Che* means "unobstructed and unburdened." When all six are unobstructed, there is nothing one cannot hear clearly, nothing one cannot taste sweetly, nothing one cannot know. Entering nowhere without self-possession—this is called returning to the root. Thus, one can inwardly see and reverse-hear, seeking within the ear, eye, nose, mouth, mind, and knowledge. Only then are the six roots liberated, free from the dust of the world—this is how one enters the Dao.

If the six are obstructed, they are blocked by things, trampling one another and harming all beings. All sentient beings rely on breath as their master. Breath—the coming and going of vital *qi*—originates in the heart and manifests through the nose. Earlier, the six were valued for their unobstructedness, and breath is their master. When human likes and dislikes miss the mark, it is because things obstruct them—this is not heaven’s fault.

The natural principle pierces and flows through all things, day and night without ceasing, never diminishing. Yet people, through the six senses, obstruct their own apertures. The womb has layered chambers to contain the five viscera and circulate *qi* and fluids. Celestial roaming is the mind’s emptiness and freedom, where the Dao arises within. A room, where mother and daughter-in-law dwell together, if not empty, leads to competition over hierarchy. The mind, assailed by myriad desires, if not empty, leads to conflict among the six apertures—this is how life is harmed.

If the mind is empty, life and death, shock and fear cannot enter; there is nowhere one does not find ease. Great forests and mountains are where the spirit resides, thus they are good for people. People know the goodness of mountains and forests but do not know the spirit that governs them. The spirit’s dwelling in mountains and forests is like the natural principle’s dwelling in the mind.

Virtue is the self-possession of one’s nature. When fame arises, virtue overflows; when virtue overflows, people no longer value virtue but fame. Contending for fame leads to violence. *Shuo* means "urgency in speech." *Zheng* is the tool of conflict. Schemes seek speed, thus they arise from persuasion. Knowledge seeks victory, thus it arises from contention. *Chai* refers to inner blockage by desires, thus it arises from clinging—none of these are natural. The many have disparate needs, and official duties align with them, thus affairs are settled decisively.

In the season of spring rains, grasses and trees surge forth from the earth, and if they fail to break through, they grow in fury. Then farmers begin to sharpen their tools, and more than half of what is planted ends up inverted. All things, when planted upside down, have no principle of life—yet in spring, even those inverted will grow. This is the work of creation, and none know why it is so. All this speaks of following the principle of naturalness.

The *Bixu Annotation* states: If one can withdraw the gaze and turn the hearing inward, draw in the breath and rinse the fluids, empty the center to conceal its function, then the six affairs will all be penetrated, and subtlety will reach its utmost without addition. Otherwise, there will be obstruction and turmoil, disorder between above and below, and all manner of illnesses will arise.

All sentient beings possessing awareness depend on breath to live. When the six senses are obstructed and the breath weakens, it is caused by the calamity of desires and aversions—this is not the fault of Heaven. The primordial qi flows through the apertures and cavities of all things and humanity, ascending and descending day and night without end. Yet when it is blocked by cravings, the empty cavities become stagnant—where then can the spirit find its abode?

Within the body lie the cinnabar field, the Three Offices, the golden hall and jade chamber, and the womb with its layered chambers. In the heart is an aperture called the Heavenly Palace, where the spirit roams and rests. If the chamber is cramped, mother and daughter-in-law turn against each other; if the heart is obstructed, desires and aversions multiply in chaos.

Thus, lush forests are the beauty of hills and mountains, but when the forest is felled, the vital atmosphere is diminished. Extraordinary talent is the beauty of the scholar, but when talent is overtaxed, the spirit is depleted. Those who boast of fame damage their virtue; those with violent ambitions harm their reputation. Planning values deep stillness—if one is hasty in deliberation, one becomes shallow and crude. Wisdom should be concealed; if it emerges through contention, it competes with things.

If one can stand firm like a stockade, unshaken and self-preserving, one avoids being harmed by external things. Official duties, when aligned with the needs of the many, are decisive in public matters, but in private, they lead to self-sacrifice. When virtue takes form, fame and knowledge become manifest, and violent contention arises; when spring rains fall, grasses and trees grow, and hoes and plows are set to work.

The multitude, in going against the Dao to seek life, are like grasses and trees that turn their roots upward yet wish to flourish. The *Yanqi Oral Teachings* state: When one attains the principle of naturalness and achieves great penetration, then what the ears and eyes perceive becomes true clarity, what the nose and mouth savor becomes true sweetness, what the heart knows becomes true knowledge, and virtue becomes true virtue.

*Geng* means "obstruction." *Zhen* refers to footprints that people see. When the Dao is obstructed, one becomes burdened by form and traces, and manifold harms arise.

Breath is life—what is called "nature" is this life, which all people possess. Only after receiving this nature of life does one gain awareness. The means by which one is aware depends on this breath. If it reaches a point where it does not accord with principle, how could Heaven have cut it off? The principle of Heaven within the human body manifests day and night, yet people block their heart’s apertures with worldly desires.

The *bao* is the membrane. The spaciousness is governed by the heart, the lord. To follow Heaven’s principle with ease is called "Heavenly wandering." If the chamber is narrow, mother and daughter-in-law quarrel—this illustrates how, when the heart is obstructed, the six senses contend.

Great hills and mountains are seen as good by people because, in ordinary times, their ears and eyes are narrow and cannot preserve the spirit of naturalness to overcome worldly desires. Seeking fame and profit causes one’s inherent nature to overflow; violent and hasty temperaments cause one’s reputation to overflow as well—both lead to the loss of name.

*Shuo* is like a drawn bowstring, implying urgency. Urgency leads to reliance on cunning schemes; contention leads to the emergence of such schemes. Stubborn clinging gives rise to the frustration of obstruction and discontent.

Those who seek to align with the needs of the many fall into the flaw of obstinate incomprehension—this speaks of the foolish child who wishes to settle official matters, yet official matters cannot be settled. When spring rains come and grasses and trees grow in fury, people sharpen their farming tools to uproot them. Do they do this with the intent to harm the grasses and trees? No—it is for the sake of cultivation, and they cannot do otherwise. That which grows grows of itself; that which is uprooted is uprooted of itself. When grasses and trees are removed, what is planted grows in their place—this is its completion, its destruction. Its destruction is its completion.

From this perspective, gain and loss, life and death—all should be left to naturalness. From the overflow of virtue downward, all are flaws of the accommodating heart. If one can be without such accommodation, then one attains Heavenly wandering.

The ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and heart—if they can be unobstructed and free from entanglement, it is because knowledge is penetrated by virtue. If virtue does not flow through them, all five become obstructed, the apertures and cavities are blocked, worldly desires surge and trample, and harm multiplies.

The breath that animates living things serves to circulate the qi throughout the body, harmonize with the balance of Heaven and Earth, and ascend and descend to nourish flourishing. It should endure without decline, growing stronger with age—this is the very doctrine upheld by those who cultivate life. Yet if one fails to nurture its source and instead engages in activities that obstruct it, this is not the way of flowing with the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth.

The primordial qi penetrates all things without ceasing. Where there is decay and decline, it is because people have reversed the six senses to block their own apertures. Sentient beings rely on breath, while plants rely on roots—both depend on the qi they receive as the basis of their lives.

The *bao* refers to the cavity. *Chonglang* means that this body arises from emptiness, and within it are the hollows of the five viscera through which qi and fluids flow. *Heavenly wandering* means that when the heart is empty, there is nowhere it cannot go with ease. If the chamber is not empty, superiors and inferiors clash in strife; if the heart is not empty, desires and aversions vie for dominance.

My chamber and my heart both have their master—how could external things disturb or agitate them? The great forests and towering mountains delight people because, having long seen only cramped and mean sights, they suddenly behold a vast and luminous expanse, and the heart must rejoice. Yet this is the spirit failing to overcome things and instead being overcome by them. The mountains, forests, and riverbanks may bring me joy that is not yet complete when sorrow follows—such is the subtle, ceaseless transformation of the great Dao, an inevitable principle.

Only the perfected person finds joy without relying on external things, and thus does not grieve with change, for they turn things by their own power. If things delight people, is it truly delight? If people take pleasure in things, is it truly pleasure? For when there is longing without, there is deficiency within; when one values that, one devalues this.

Fame is a public vessel and cannot be taken in excess, so the pursuit of fame is a loss of virtue. To possess fame and then flaunt it is yet another failure of fame. Both are losses—if one hastily seeks a remedy, one sees that contention arises from striving, and this is the proof of how manifold harms are born. Even those who can preserve themselves err in being blocked and unyielding, clinging to private interests.

In official affairs, the duty lies in what is fitting for all. "Fitting for all" means that the preceding six—seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and thinking—are all impartial and shared with the world. Otherwise, desires and cravings arise like grasses in spring rain, growing wildly and unstoppably. Thus begins the sharpening of farming tools—if governance is not applied early, though weeds are pulled, they sprout again with the rain, for the season makes it so, and none perceive it.

Human life depends on breath, and if one allows it to decline without vigor, are there no ways to support, protect, and replenish it? The key lies in knowing the proper time. This is another subtle revelation of the *Nanhua* on the secrets of nurturing life—scholars should ponder it deeply.

Master Chu Boxiu of Wulin, *External Things* (Chapter Four)

Stillness may remedy illness; slander may ease old age; tranquility may halt haste. Yet though this be so, such are the tasks of the toiling—never the concern of the untroubled, who have never encountered them nor inquired after them.

What startles the world is not what the spirit-person inquires after; what startles the age is not what the sage inquires after; what startles the state is not what the noble person inquires after; what aligns with the times is not what the petty person inquires after.

In Yanmen, when a man’s kin died, he was ennobled as a court master for his virtuous mourning, and half his kinsmen perished from emulating his grief. Yao offered the world to Xu You, who fled from it. Tang offered it to Wu Guang, who raged against him. When Ji Tuo heard of this, he led his disciples to crouch by the Kuang River, and the feudal lords came to mourn. Three years later, Shentu Di threw himself into the river.

The fish-trap exists for the fish—once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. The snare exists for the hare—once the hare is caught, the snare is forgotten. Words exist for meaning—once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. Where shall I find one who has forgotten words, that I may speak with them?

Guo’s commentary: To remedy illness, ease old age, or halt haste is not to be without illness, old age, or haste. Yet even such efforts remain labor, and thus the untroubled transcend and disregard them. The spirit-person resides within; the sage acts without. Each has their own path of advance and retreat, each their own rank of high and low. To revere filial piety for reward is far from the truth—this is the excess of esteem. Its waves disturb the nature, even driving men to drown in rivers, losing the intent of the two sages and reducing all to silence.

Lü’s commentary: Stillness to halt haste—these were among the arts of the ancients. Yet motion precedes stillness, flourishing precedes pruning, blazing precedes extinction, turmoil precedes tranquility. Such teachings are for the toiling, to ease their labor. The untroubled have never moved—why would they need stillness? They have never flourished—why would they need pruning? They have never blazed—why would they need extinction? They have never been in turmoil—why would they need tranquility? This is why they do not inquire. Only the virtuous attain untroubled ease, which the spirit and the sage both embody. Confucius and Laozi were born in the same Zhou era; Zhuangzi and Mencius both traveled in Liang—yet their words never touched, for their Ways differed and did not conspire together. The spirit-person and the sage differ in their traces; the noble person and the worthy differ in their talents; the noble and the petty are divided by righteousness and profit. The court master’s exhortation led his kinsmen to grieve unto death; Xu You’s flight led his followers to drown in rivers. Such is the harm of clinging to traces. Zhuangzi feared later generations would grasp his words but miss their intent, so he cited these two cases and concluded with the metaphor of the trap and snare, urging scholars to forget words and seek meaning.

Yi Du’s commentary: Here, *jing* (静) is likely a scribal error for *mo* (默).

Ziwei refers to trimming and leveling the beard and temples to erase the signs of age; the term may also be written as "shearing and erasing." Stillness and silence may remedy illness, yet this is not true freedom from illness. Resting in old age and halting haste are both products of human effort, not of nature—such are the tasks of the toiling, and thus the carefree have never inquired after them. *Xie* means "to drive" or "to govern." The sage is but the remnant thread of the spirit-person. Those who achieve merit for the world are the worthy. The virtue and work of the sage yield the effect of ordering the world. The noble person is the worthy’s refuge in name, possessing the affairs of governing the state. The petty person is the opposite of the noble. Thus, none of these have ever transgressed to inquire further.

Yanmen was a gate of the Song capital; in that place, there was one who mourned his parent’s death with such exemplary grief that the Lord of Song, admiring his filial piety, ennobled him as a court master. The villagers, emulating him, forced wails and feigned devastation, until half perished from self-destruction. Such is the harm of clinging to traces. Though the sage possesses the path to ordering the world, it fundamentally arises from non-action—through non-action, nothing is left undone.

Xu You and Wu Guang were ancients who practiced non-action, fleeing from Yao and Tang. They saw that these rulers had not yet attained the state of "nothing left undone," while Ji Ta and Shentu Di were even more extreme. The metaphor of the trap and snare requires no further explanation.

Bixu’s commentary: Stillness may remedy illness, yet it cannot fully restore the spirit. Shearing and erasing the signs of age cannot return one to infancy. Rather than halting haste, it is better to extinguish the heart-mind. The *Zhen Gao* states that pressing the corners of the eyes with the hands at times, so as to see light clearly, is the way to examine the spirit of the eyes; prolonged practice allows one to perceive the hundred spirits. The portents of aging appear in the *zi* of the eyes; smoothing wrinkles and creases can bathe the visage of age. Nevertheless, these are the tasks of the toiling, and thus the carefree transcendently disregard them. The sage, however, possesses a name.

The spirit-person leaves no trace. The worthy person esteems conduct and righteousness, which are but the surplus affairs of the sage. The noble person values following principle, which is but the dust and grime of the worthy. The petty person engages in careless deeds, which are but the superfluous growths of the noble.

The men of Yanmen’s faction mourned to excess, forcing tears that harmed their nature, for they clung to externals and lost their true selves, bound deeply by the lure of stipends. Ji Ta and Shentu Di crouched in caves and threw themselves into rivers, dissipating their true nature—all through deliberate conduct and the excess of love for fame. Once fish and hare are caught, the trap and snare may be forgotten; once the marvel of the Dao is realized, words and teachings instantly align.

Even the fisherman and hunter do not falsely adorn their hasty bargains—how much less should the seeker of subtleties craftily engage in discourse? The *Yanqi Kouyi* states: If the heart-mind can rest in stillness, then past losses may be repaired and made whole. Cutting away worldly desires allows one to roam freely to old age. Calming body and heart-mind can halt haste and urgency. These all speak of loss followed by recovery, illness followed by cure—hence the tasks of the toiling. For those at ease, whose hearts are fundamentally still, such matters need not be raised. These are not the concerns of the carefree, for *suo* here is akin to *hai* (startling). The sage governs the world through benevolence and righteousness—this is startling. The worthy startles the age with abundant virtue. The noble startles the state with reputation. The petty person busily seeks to conform for a time, yet even a slight elevation beyond this leaves such matters behind.

In Yanmen, one who excelled at mourning received a title; the villagers admired him, and half died from excessive grief—this illustrates the burden of love for fame. Xu You and Wu Guang gained renown through reclusion. Ji Ta, admiring them, squatted by the Xiang River (his crouching carried a sense of disdain, as if expecting the feudal lords to yield their states to him—already laughable). Three years later, Shentu Di, coveting the fame of reclusion, threw himself into the river and died—this exemplifies the extreme of love for fame. Having said all this, the text concludes with the metaphor of the trap and snare, mirroring the style of the previous section, where words suffice or do not suffice.

Remedying illness, erasing signs of age, halting haste—all involve labor and loss followed by efforts at recovery, not the affairs of the carefree, and thus are passed over without concern. The spirit-person’s relation to the sage, the sage’s to the worthy, the worthy’s to the noble—all are thus. If one seeks to conform to the times, one drifts far from the noble.

All this views the small from the vantage of the great, whose virtue and capacity encompass them without further inquiry, ultimately allowing self-transformation. Thus, one may ascend step by step. Therefore, whatever lies outside, the sage treats with non-insistence, and only then engages the world without harm. Though the sages of the Three Teachings established different teachings, their words never disparaged one another, aiming only to open the human heart and provide resources for governance, converging in goodness and no further.

*Hai* is the same as *hai* (startling). The *Dechong Fu* speaks of "startling the world"; Cui’s edition writes *hai*, which may be referenced. The men of Yanmen’s faction, admiring one who mourned well, forgot death. Xu You fled Yao; Shentu Di, admiring him, threw himself into the river—all took traces for the real, losing their own true selves, no different from pointing to the trap and snare to seek fish and hare. How deluded they were!

Thus, Zhuangzi thought of those who forget words and spoke to them, so that words forgotten, meaning might be grasped. This section begins by weighing the relative importance of inner and outer, clarifying the closeness of self and other. What lies outside is bound to things, and thus cannot be insisted upon. What lies within proceeds from the self; seek it, and it is attained. Yet most people strive for externals, and when they fail to obtain them, resentment and blame arise. Thus, the text establishes words to dispel their delusion.

Even the good deeds of loyalty and filial piety, which establish the self, cannot ensure the ruler’s or parents’ recognition, for they seek the inner through the outer—how much less can one seek the outer through the outer? From this, we know that within life and destiny, there is nothing that is not the Dao; realize it, and it is complete. Outside life and destiny, there is nothing that is not things; insisting on them leads to loss. Only through effortless non-action, silently aligning with the Dao, can one escape the twin pitfalls.

Zhuangzi’s metaphor of lending grain and the fish with outstretched fins speaks of bestowing things in due time. The Lord of Ren’s angling, scorning petty schemes, clarifies that the Dao must be preserved. Great scholars, citing the *Odes* and practicing the *Rites*, may yet rob graves for pearls. Their initial studies were not necessarily improper, but swayed by worldly desires, they transgress prohibitions and harm transformation without compunction—less admirable than the unlearned, who at least retain scruples and rest content in their allotted place.

All this traces the fault to those above who govern the people with sagely wisdom, for over time, the cunning among the people steal this wisdom for themselves. The text then introduces a parable with Lao Lai and Confucius, forgetting both praise and blame, so that worldly clamor naturally ceases—this embodies the idea that through my non-action, the people transform themselves. The white tortoise could foresee dreams but could not escape the net, for spirit does not make itself spirit without recognizing the spirit that is not spirit—this metaphor shows that relying on knowledge to escape trouble is not as good as forgetting knowledge and being without trouble.

Next, it states that only when one knows the useless can one speak of the useful, with meanings mutually illuminating. It discusses the "ability to wander," meaning to wander the heart-mind in blandness, wandering inwardly. The preceding passages are parables; here, it states, "Zhuangzi says," directly addressing the text’s central aim: to enable scholars to transcend the burdens of external things and advance into the realm of emptiness and penetration, where spirit fuses and intent is at ease, going wherever it will—then the Dao is near.

As worldly habits decline, people often wander where they should not, wandering into reckless haste, overturning and falling without regard. Even if a sage were to reappear, what could be done? Some delight in wandering, yet merely take rivers and seas as leisure, mountains and forests as goodness, and dissipate their lives—these wander the world in seclusion, yet cannot escape striving for externals.

Continuing with instruction, it teaches that when the body values the six penetrations, the Dao does not become obstructed; when knowledge relies on rest, one should value emptiness. When the chamber is empty, brightness arises, and there is nowhere one does not wander in the Heavenly roaming. Thus, the toilers’ pursuits are of no concern to the at ease—just as the noble and the sage differ in degree.

As for Yanmen, who gained rank through slander, or Shentu, who fled Tang and drowned in the river, both arose from prizing lofty and exceptional conduct, while below, they established purity and cultivation. Their original intent was to sharpen the world and revive teaching, yet they did not realize they harmed life and corrupted custom. Thus, they are raised as mirrors for later generations.

Now, to observe conduct through words is also an external thing, yet without pointing, one cannot see the moon. Therefore, the noble man does not weary of earnest speech, while the learner must skillfully seek its essence.

**Parables, First**

"Parables make up nineteen parts; weighty words, seventeen; *sha* words emerge daily, harmonizing with Heaven’s boundary.

Parables in nineteen parts borrow external discussions. A father does not act as matchmaker for his son. If a father recommends him, it is not as effective as if someone other than his father does. It is not my fault—it is others’ fault. If it aligns with oneself, one responds; if it does not align, one resists. What aligns with oneself is deemed right; what differs is deemed wrong.

Weighty words in seventy parts serve to conclude speech—these are the words of the venerable. Though one may be older, without warp and weft, beginning and end to mark their seniority, they are not truly senior. A person without means to surpass others lacks the human Way; one without the human Way is called a worn-out person.

*Sha* words emerge daily, harmonizing with Heaven’s boundary, flowing and extending to exhaust the year. Without speech, all is equal; equality with speech is not equal, and speech with equality is not equal—thus, it is said, ‘no speech.’ Speaking without speaking, one speaks all one’s life yet never speaks; remaining silent all one’s life, one never fails to speak.

There is that by which it is permissible, and that by which it is not; there is that by which it is so, and that by which it is not. How is it so? It is so in being so. How is it not so? It is not so in not being so. How is it permissible? It is permissible in being permissible. How is it not permissible? It is not permissible in not being permissible. Things inherently have that by which they are so; things inherently have that by which they are permissible. Nothing is not so; nothing is not permissible.

Without *sha* words emerging daily, harmonizing with Heaven’s boundary, who could attain longevity? All things are seeds, succeeding one another in different forms, beginning and end like a ring. None grasp their order—this is called Heaven’s equality. Heaven’s equality is Heaven’s boundary."

Guo’s commentary: Entrusting it to others, ten words are believed nine times. What the world values, ten words are believed seven times. *Sha*: when full, it tips; when empty, it tilts—it is not held by constancy. How much more with words, which follow things and change with them. "Emerging daily" means daily renewal; daily renewal exhausts the natural allotment, and when allotment is exhausted, harmony is achieved.

Words issuing from oneself are often not accepted by custom, so one borrows external ears—figures like Jianwu and Lianshu serve this purpose. A father’s praise of his son is often not believed; even when believed, it is suspected due to common bias. Thus, one borrows external discussion. Even if one is trusted, those harboring habitual doubt still do not accept it. Entrusting it to others, they believe—such is the burden in people’s hearing.

Alignment and opposition, mutual reproach—three differences in agreement, two differences in dispute. One must take rightness from the undisputed, for though all differ, one alone trusts what they deem right. What is this if not borrowing externally?

Weighty words, because of their venerability, are commonly valued by custom. Without borrowing externally, seven in ten would be believed. Though one precedes others in age, without the rest—warp and weft, beginning and end—to serve others, they are not truly senior. They are merely worn-out people, yet all believe them—this is how custom clings to the old and habitual.

Now, the natural has its allotment, and thus right and wrong have no fixed ground, flowing endlessly without determination. Remaining open and unattached, following as it comes—this is how each exhausts their Heaven-appointed years. Entrusting it to things and employing their words, then this and that, right and wrong, naturally equalize. If one establishes words to equalize them, then I and things are no longer equal.

Speaking what others speak, yet I ultimately do not speak—thus, one never speaks, yet never fails to speak. Their inclinations differ, with what is permissible and not, yet things each naturally have their own permissibility. Speaking broadly, nothing is impermissible in the end.

Only words that follow things and accord with their natural allotment can avoid premature decline. Though transformations succeed one another, their qi remains one. Today is the beginning; yesterday, the end—such is the principle itself, and none grasp its order. Is equality arbitrary? It is all the natural allotment!

Lü’s commentary: In nineteen parables, eleven are not parables; in seventeen weighty words, thirteen are not weighty. *Sha* words emerging daily, harmonizing with Heaven’s boundary—whether parable or not, weighty or not, all are *sha* words.

What are the nineteen parables? The Dao is near in our hearts, yet if we discuss it with our hearts, others doubt and do not believe. Just as a father does not act as matchmaker for his son, one must borrow external discussion. It is not that I do not wish to speak directly—people cannot be spoken to directly, so I speak for this reason.

What are the seventeen weighty words? If it aligns with oneself, one responds and deems it right; if it differs, one resists and deems it wrong. What I speak to others, I wish for their response, not their resistance. Thus, I follow what their hearts value—the words of the venerable—and speak of what I value as if it were my own words. All citations of antiquity in this book are instances of valuing the venerable. What they have heard precedes me—not because of age."

If one possesses the warp and woof, root and branch sufficient to surpass others, people will follow. Without means to surpass others, one is but a long-standing person—how can such be deemed weighty?

Words that emerge as if never having been spoken are like the sun rising—merely halting at dawn. The *zhi*-vessel, when poured from, yields in due time, for it is hollow within and holds no accumulation. The "Heavenly Boundary" is the utmost of non-action, where the sage finds repose. Harmonizing with right and wrong, resting in the "Heavenly Balance," then all emergence and withdrawal, speech and silence, are nothing but the "Heavenly Balance." Following its unfolding, extending it by principle, one exhausts the years. Only by being without self and without speech can all be made equal; with speech, there is self and other—how can equality be achieved? Thus, equality and speech, speech and equality, have never been equal. Though silence may be equal, it remains unequal to speech; this is not yet the great equality. Only when speech is without speech does the great equality arise—this is *zhi*-speech.

Thus, one may speak all one’s life yet never have spoken; one may remain silent all one’s life yet never have ceased speaking. What is called "acceptable" and "unacceptable," "so" and "not so," all have their origins. If there are inherent affirmations and acceptances, then there are no inherent negations or rejections—this can be known. The seeds of the myriad things emerge without ever differing in origin. Knowing their sameness is to know their beginning and end as a circle—this is the "Heavenly Balance." The "Heavenly Balance" harmonizes right and wrong within it, equalizing the myriad things, the utmost of non-action—hence it is called the "Heavenly Boundary."

**Dú’s Annotation:**
*Yu-yen* (parables) are names devised for speech.
*Chong-yen* (weighty words) are what the world venerates.
*Zhi-yen* (goblet words) resemble Laozi’s saying: "Good words are without flaw or riddle."

When the *zhi*-vessel is full, it tilts; when empty, it rights itself—this illustrates how good speech adapts to the moment, emerging like the sun without exhaustion, thus harmonizing with nature’s allotment. To have ten words and be believed nine times, or seven times, is constrained by yin-yang numerology and cannot be inexhaustible. Words from oneself are often disbelieved by the vulgar, so a father does not act as matchmaker for his son but borrows external discussion—this is *yu-yen*. *Chong-yen* involves attributing words to figures like Confucius or Yan Hui; though the words originate from oneself, if they can be revered, they become the words of the venerable. Without warp and woof, root and branch, even the venerable are not weighty.

Learning that attains the Dao enables one to surpass others; otherwise, one is but a stale person. The sage’s words respond to things appropriately, flowing without lingering—hence they are said to "rise like the sun." Only by harmonizing with the "Heavenly Boundary" can one unfold endlessly through the years. *Zhi*-speech emerges from non-speech; in non-speech, the myriad principles naturally align, but with speech, they do not. Zhuangzi’s *zhi*-speech arises after equality is achieved, yet equality and speech, speech and equality, remain unequal. Nothing compares to non-speech—though in non-speech, one never ceases speaking. Did Confucius, wishing to be without words, ever truly cease speaking? Words emerging from non-speech, though spoken all day, respond to things—what intent lies in speech? Though silent all day, one may still engage the world—how can this not be speech? This is the meaning of Zhuangzi’s *zhi*-speech.

What is acceptable has its origin; what is unacceptable has none. What is "so" has its origin; what is "not so" has none. The following text embodies these origins of affirmation, negation, right and wrong, self and other—acceptability and unacceptability, "so" and "not so"—to equalize self and other, unify right and wrong. Affirming what is affirmed, accepting what is acceptable, inherently so, allows the myriad things to each suffice within their nature and destiny. Affirmation and acceptance lie in things, not in oneself.

Without *zhi*-speech rising like the sun, harmonizing with the "Heavenly Boundary," who could endure long? "Seed" is the beginning of things’ arising. The myriad forms and changes are inexhaustible, succeeding one another in beginning and end like a circle without end. None grasp its order—this is what is meant by principle. The "Heavenly Balance" is beyond human effort. "Heavenly Balance" speaks of its levelness; "Heavenly Boundary" speaks of its origin—both are metaphors for the natural.

**Bìxū’s Annotation:**
Nine out of ten parables are believed; three out of ten weighty words are disbelieved—this is the world’s view. The *zhi*-vessel, full, tilts; empty, it rights itself; centered, it is upright. The sun, rising, slants; past noon, it declines; at midday, it is bright. *Zhi*-speech takes its uprightness; the sun’s rising takes its center. The noble one’s words emerge centered and bright, harmonizing with the utmost of principle.

Borrowed words are often trusted. A father’s praise of his son is hard to craft skillfully. The world does not examine right and wrong but deems what aligns with itself as good. Weight is given to the venerable; if age precedes but virtue does not, it is not precedence—merely a stale person. *Zhi*-speech rises like the sun, centered and bright, harmonizing with the utmost of principle, flowing with unobstructed words—thus one exhausts one’s years without regret.

"Non-speech" means silence, by which parables, weighty words, and *zhi*-speech are all made equal. For in non-speech, principle naturally aligns. Parables, weighty words, and *zhi*-speech are unequal by themselves. Thus, equality and speech are unequal—speech belongs to speech, equality to equality, akin to the idea of one and speech as two. "Speech without speech" means speech without attachment. The halting of speech is centered—how could it be attached? Without the attachments of right and wrong, love and aversion, there are no words of right and wrong, love and aversion—thus one may speak all one’s life yet never have spoken. If one seals one’s lips and binds one’s sack, yet centeredness never leaves the heart, then one may remain silent all day yet never cease speaking.

What is acceptable or unacceptable, "so" or "not so," all have their origins. What is "so" and acceptable arises from the Dao; what is "not so" and unacceptable does not.

For what is inherently "so" and acceptable, there is nothing that is not "so" or unacceptable. Thus, I once more cite the *zhi*-speech that endures, summarizing the preceding discussion.

The myriad things, though of different kinds, succeed one another by principle. The formed transforms into the formless; the formless generates the formed. The sentient intermingles with the insentient; the insentient shifts into the sentient. Their beginning shows no head; their end reveals no tail. Cyclical and unfathomable, this is called the "Heavenly Equality." Naturally balanced and level, it takes their utmost distinctions alone.

**Liu’s Commentary:** Water in a vessel is like speech within virtue—if not full, it does not flow.

What comes from without may be augmented yet not increased; what issues from within, though abundant, is never diminished. Thus, *zhi*-speech emerges daily.

Things have their boundaries and traces, yet the natural trace of beginning and end is like a ring. Thus, it is said: "Harmonized by Heaven’s trace." Like creeping vines or flowing water, this illustrates the thread of the natural. The Dao is whole, and things are unharmed—thus one may live out one’s years.

To speak all one’s life yet never have spoken, or to remain silent all one’s life yet never cease speaking—then the *Six Classics* are not fragmented, nor is the *Laozi* overly concise. If one uses parables to dissect human unity, or repeated words to dissect human trust, both are purposeful speech—the dregs of speech. Thus, *zhi*-speech is the root of all speech!

**Yanzhai’s Oral Exegesis:** A vessel holds wine; drinking it, one finds flavor. "Emerging daily" means that in every matter, this speech exists, harmonizing all hearts by Heavenly principle. A father acting as his son’s matchmaker—people would not believe it, so he relies on others’ prior words to quell disputes. Borrowing authority from elders, listeners dare not object, for the ancient sage-kings were all elders.

"Warps and woofs" refer to knowing constancy and change, beginning and end. "A full cycle of years" means a lifespan of a hundred. One who studies yet shows no attainment is unfit to lead others—such a person is but an old, useless relic. "Creeping and flowing" means attaining fulfillment through the years, thus passing one’s days and months.

To take wordless speech as speech is to return to the One Principle. But to express the One in words, or to discuss the One through words, is to allow the heart-mind to become uneven and divided. Only wordlessness is even—speech without intent is true speech. Thus, one may speak all one’s life yet never have spoken. In the midst of silence, one awakens others to principle—this is not true silence.

What people call acceptable or unacceptable, "so" or "not so," each has its own justification. How could I alone affirm or deny them? I simply follow what is inherently "so" and acceptable in affirming and accepting it. For what is inherently "so" and acceptable, there is nothing that is not "so" or unacceptable. The *Qi Wu* chapter discusses this in great detail.

If not for natural speech harmonizing all mouths, how could it remain unscathed through the ages? The seeds of the myriad things emerge from creation, succeeding one another between Heaven and Earth in their wondrous patterns, unfathomable in their principles. "Heavenly Equality" means the commonality of Heavenly principle.

The meanings of parables and repeated words have been clarified in various commentaries. The theory of "ten parts, nine or seven" is superior—those who speak from their own minds are few. This refers to worldly people who lack inner constancy, swaying with others’ judgments. Thus, one adapts one’s words to the moment, guiding others to trust and cultivate goodness. Such is the urgency of caring for the world and loving the people!

Interpretations of "vessel-speech" vary. A vessel holding water is like speech carrying the Dao. The Dao is not something speech can exhaust, just as water is not something a vessel can measure. To say the Dao does not belong to speech, or water does not belong to the vessel, is incorrect. Thus, its words emerge endlessly without exhaustion, and people listen without tiring—unlike parables or repeated words, which have their omissions and selections. For one who harmonizes by natural distinctions can unite all hearts under Heaven. With no intent of my own, what room is there for debates over sameness, difference, right, or wrong?

The saying "a father does not act as his son’s matchmaker" fully captures the essence of parables. I rely on others’ prior words because they would otherwise be hard to believe. Their sameness and difference lie in words, yet the response appears in deeds. This is not as good as wordless wholeness, where no one differs from me. Yet wordless wholeness is not as good as speech without intent, which transforms things without resistance.

Repeated words also come from prior speech. "Warps and woofs" discuss talent; "roots and branches" clarify learning. This further serves to admonish and encourage scholars. *Zhi*-speech is inexhaustible yet harmonizes by natural distinctions, flowing freely and creatively to live out one’s years—what worldly burdens could reach it? At this point, it is sufficient.

Later, it sweeps aside the edges, saying: In the principles of all things under Heaven, silence brings equality, uniting with the Dao. Equality and speech are like nonbeing and being, coarse and subtle—different principles. How can they be equal? Only by transcending being and nonbeing, merging coarse and subtle, does great equality arise. Thus, it is said: "wordless." This should be understood as the word "speech" in the following text.

This further clarifies the wonder of never having spoken and never having ceased speaking—spirit-like and transformative, not stagnating in the advance of speech or silence, yet all under Heaven follow like shadows. For speech that is acceptable or "so" arises from what is inherently so and acceptable—thus there is nothing that is not "so" or unacceptable. This is why *zhi*-speech encompasses parables and repeated words without omission. Thus, its words fill the world without fault.

The final chapter of this classic states: *Zhi*-speech is "creeping and flowing," repeated words are "real," and parables are "expansive." From this, we know that the words of this classic, vast and profound, endlessly transforming, do not exceed these three categories. Yet to leave no traces is easy; to act without treading is hard. To be silent is easy; to speak without flaw or obscurity is hard.

The *Nanhua* establishes these three modes of speech precisely to avoid flaws and reproach. To use speech to avoid flaws and reproach is akin to forgetting speech and thus being free of them. "Forgetting" means having yet not having—it is not the one-sided insistence on silence. To push the discussion of "forgetting speech" to its limit approaches what the Master desired in "having no speech."

All things in the world emerge from the same mechanism, yet their endowed forms differ, succeeding one another endlessly. Likewise, speech arises from the same heart, yet arguments vary, and debates are boundless. The sage therefore does not initiate but responds, speaking in accord with others—not his own words—thus like a ring without end, its limits cannot be fathomed. For my part, I harmonize with right and wrong and rest within the bounds of nature’s allotment. This, too, is the intent behind "dispensing with speech."

Zhuangzi said to Huizi: "Confucius, at sixty years of age, underwent sixty transformations. What he initially affirmed, he later denied. Who knows whether what he now calls right is not what he deemed wrong at fifty-nine?" Huizi replied: "Confucius diligently applied his will and exhausted his knowledge." Zhuangzi said: "Confucius has renounced such efforts, yet he has never spoken of it. Confucius said: 'One receives one’s endowment from the Great Root and revives the spirit to live. Singing in accord with the pitch, speaking in accord with the law, profit and righteousness are set before one, yet likes and dislikes, right and wrong merely conform to what people say. If one could make people submit in their hearts and dare not stand in opposition, thereby settling the world’s settlements—ah, ah! How could I ever attain such a state!'"

Guo’s Annotation: As the years pass, one transforms with them, moving in tandem with the age. When the times change, so too do the sentiments of the world. Yet those who ride things to roam in the mind—how are they different from the common crowd? Change never ceases, and thus nothing remains constant. To say that Confucius first applied his will and clung to knowledge before realizing he could not master self-transformation—this only shows how far Huizi falls short of the sage’s far-reaching resonance. Confucius renounced change as something self-so, not something achieved by knowledge or effort. Thus, he followed the times, responded to things, and never forced words. Had he enslaved himself to his rustic knowledge without returning to the root of spirit, life would have perished. "Singing" arises from the pitch; "speaking" emerges from the law. Both pitch and law are what the multitude creates, and the sage merely employs them. Thus, he never errs, yet he has never spoken of it, never acted upon it. "I have no words of my own—likes and dislikes, right and wrong, the display of righteousness and profit—these merely follow what people say. The mouth expresses the heart; if one uses the mouths of others, one uses their hearts as well. If I align with the hearts of others, who would dare stand in opposition? Letting the world settle itself, I settle it—what more is there to do? Riding along with it, nothing is beyond reach."

Lü’s Annotation: The tradition holds that at sixty, Confucius’s ear was attuned, and at seventy, he followed his heart. Following the heart, whatever the mind conceives is free of right and wrong; whatever the mouth utters is free of profit and harm. Before the Way reaches the point of following the heart, one cannot escape transformation. Transformation necessarily begins with affirmation and ends with denial—how can one be certain that what is called right at sixty is not what was deemed wrong at fifty-nine? Huizi did not understand that this was where Confucius was like others. As for where he was one with Heaven, from ancient times to the present, there has never been transformation that was truly considered the result of applying one’s will or clinging to knowledge. "Renounced" means to cast it away entirely. To receive the power to live is called virtue—this is what is meant by "receiving one’s endowment from the Great Root and reviving the spirit to live." Before birth, there is no qi, no form—how could there be what is called spirit? With birth comes qi and form, and thus the spirit is revived. "Singing in accord with the pitch" requires no effort to tune the sound. "Speaking in accord with the law" requires no effort to explain principles. Yet when righteousness and profit are set before one, and one then follows with likes and dislikes, right and wrong—this merely conforms to what people say. Because what one relies upon is not yet settled, it is not a matter of non-action and self-transformation. If one could make people submit in their hearts and dare not stand in opposition, thereby settling the world’s settlements—this would be enabling self-transformation, not merely conforming to what people say. "How could I ever attain such a state!"—this is his renunciation, of which he has never spoken.

Yu Du’s Annotation: At sixty, Confucius’s ear was attuned, and thus he was free of right and wrong. Huizi, not understanding this, thought it was achieved by applying one’s will and clinging to knowledge. "Renounced" is like the alternation of yin and yang. Never having spoken of it—the Great Root and the transformations of creation: all human endowments are received from creation. If one can return to the root and revive the spirit, the principle of life is attained. If one is enslaved to external things, the root is lost, the spirit perishes—how can life be preserved? Pitch arises from the qi of yin and yang; law follows the virtue of Heaven and Earth. The sage harmonizes with the qi of yin and yang, thus singing in accord with the pitch; he aligns with the virtue of Heaven and Earth, thus speaking in accord with the law. Now, when righteousness and profit are set before one, giving rise to likes and dislikes, right and wrong from one’s private views—this merely conforms to what people say, not to their hearts. To make people’s hearts submit, one must follow and yield to them, dare not stand in opposition, and let the world settle itself—this is what it means to be attuned. "Ah, ah!" expresses the desire for non-action. If I do nothing, they will settle themselves—thus, "How could I ever attain such a state!"

Bi Xu’s Annotation: As the years advance, virtue and nature grow ever clearer—this aligns with the chapter on Lian Boyu, though the meaning differs. To gradually awaken, first affirming and later denying, is to remain unable to forget oneself. But Confucius moved with transformation without stagnation, making others forget themselves—this is difficult. Initially affirming what is right, responding to things as they change; ultimately denying it, returning to the correct Way. What was not right before and what is not wrong now—this is diminishing yet ever increasing. Applying one’s will leads to fewer transformations; clinging to knowledge leads to greater self-importance. Confucius long renounced the world’s entanglements and never burdened himself with words. Those who receive their endowment from the Great Dao—even sagehood is not something to rely upon. Those who revive their spirit-nature to be born—follow change and yield to transformation. Thus, his voice harmonized with the mean, his words became cultural teachings. Righteousness and profit were set forth in the records—how could this merely conform to what people say? It extended to making others submit in their hearts, follow in reverence, and adhere to ancient principles—who would dare stand in opposition? Holding to this and yielding to the world, one can settle the world’s settlements. "I cannot attain such a state"—Confucius’s humble words.

*Yongzhai Oral Teachings*: Applying the mind and serving through knowledge and perception refers to broad learning. Confucius renounced the pursuit of broad learning to advance in the Way, though he never spoke of it to others. "Endowment" is like nature; "root" is the beginning. What the Creator bestows is the nature of awareness. Returning to the original nature of awareness, one can then fulfill the Way of human life. "Singing" is speech; "pitch" is law. When righteousness and profit are set before one, and one has likes and dislikes, right and wrong, then one can conform to what people say, but not to their hearts. Only by setting aside righteousness, profit, right, and wrong can one make people’s hearts submit. Without anyone daring to stand in opposition, one can then settle the world’s settled principles. Zhuangzi, having praised the Master’s heart, turned to Huizi and sighed: "Ah, ah! How could I ever attain such a state!"—this is reverence for the Master’s utmost attainment. Human life transforms with the years—this is unavoidable for the worthy and the foolish alike.

Within, thoughts and reflections daily accumulate; without, form and appearance daily alter. Gains and losses, advantages and harms assail one another; right and wrong, success and failure shift and change. All that arises and vanishes like illusions, dust, bubbles, and shadows before one—these are transformations. The Master reached sixty years and underwent sixty transformations, so that the Way of life renewed itself daily without stagnation. How could the old linger in his dwelling?

Though transformation is shared by all, the capacity to receive it differs from person to person. As the *Book of the Yellow Emperor* states: "The cosmos lies within the palm, the myriad transformations arise from the body." How true! Sixty years mark one full cycle of heaven and earth’s branches and stems, the midpoint of human life’s longest span. With long experience, right and wrong may seem settled—yet one still cannot know whether what is deemed right today was not wrong at fifty-nine. Tracing its source, the obstacle lies in the persistence of the self. If one has not yet attained selflessness, one cannot be certain that what follows sixty is truly right. Thus, even the Master Yu sighed over his fifty-nine errors.

"Diligent aspiration" refers to the accumulation of learning; "submitting to knowledge" refers to the application of ability. The Master had long since relinquished what he had learned and what he could do, silently advancing in this Way without others’ awareness.

All receive their talents and nature from the Creator; only by restoring one’s innate spirit can the Way of life endure. To this must be added the fullness of learning and the cultivation of virtue and achievement. "Singing accords with pitch, speech accords with law"—just as sound becomes pitch, the body becomes measure. All these arise from the spirit, and the human Way may then be called complete.

Yet when righteousness and profit stand before one, and one takes one’s own likes and dislikes as right and wrong, one merely silences others’ mouths. Most scholars of the world are thus—only the Master could make others submit in heart, daring not to follow blindly, without hidden resistance, as Master Fan’s punctuation makes clear. "Establishing the settled principles of the world" speaks to the swiftness of his transformation.

"Ah, ah! How could I ever attain such a state!"—these are Zhuangzi’s words of admiration for the Master. *The Ocean of Meanings in the Southern Florescence True Scripture*, Scroll Ninety-One, ends here. #1 The characters "自有" should be reversed to "有自."

**Parable the Second**

When Master Zeng took office a second time, his heart had undergone transformation. He said: "When I first served to provide for my parents, a stipend of three *fu* brought me joy; later, though I received three thousand *zhong*, my parents were gone, and my heart grieved." His disciples asked Confucius: "Can one such as Shen be said to be free of entanglement in blame?" Confucius replied: "He is already entangled. How could one free of entanglement feel sorrow?"

To him, three *fu* or three thousand *zhong* were like watching sparrows, gnats, and flies pass before him. Guo’s commentary: *Xuan* means "to bind." Shen served for the sake of his parents, free from the fault of being bound to emolument. Emolument is for nurturing; nurturing is for contentment, not for the means themselves. If one is unbound, then whether noble or base, the mind remains even, tranquil, and at ease, fulfilling the proper way of serving with devotion. To one unbound, honor and emolument are but gnats, flies, or sparrows passing before him—how could sorrow or joy arise therein?

Lü’s commentary: Abiding in timeliness and accordance, sorrow and joy cannot enter—this the ancients called the "Celestial Unbinding." Thus, one free of entanglement cannot feel sorrow. Life and death are great matters, yet sorrow and joy cannot enter; then three *fu* or three thousand *zhong* are like watching sparrows, gnats, and flies pass by—clearly, their magnitude or quantity is not worth comparing.

Yi Du’s commentary: Master Zeng served out of poverty. When his stipend first reached his parents, though it was but three *fu*, his heart rejoiced; later, when he received three thousand *zhong*, his parents were gone, and his heart grieved. This is why his heart underwent transformation twice. His disciples, seeing that Master Zeng loved his parents and was not burdened by emolument, asked Confucius about it. Confucius said that Shen’s filial piety was love, but he had not forgotten his parents, so sorrow and joy remained in his breast—how could he be free of entanglement? Only one unbound can be free of sorrow, thus regarding *zhong* and *fu* as so light. This is to say Master Zeng had not yet attained such a state.

Bi Xu’s commentary: Joy and sorrow mark the two transformations. Filial devotion does not depend on poverty or wealth; attendance and nurture are not a matter of abundance or meagerness. Yet Master Zeng spoke thus—his heart still harbored the entanglement of the common man. However, Shen was called perfectly filial, and if he were truly free of the fault of being bound to emolument, how could sorrow arise? If he regarded *zhong* and *fu* as gnats and flies, then his entanglement could be dissolved.

*The Oral Teachings of Yan Zhai*: The disciples asked whether Master Zeng’s words revealed the fault of entanglement, suspecting that his two transformations—joy and sorrow—betrayed such a bind. Confucius replied that this very sorrow and joy were the entanglement. If one were unbound, external things passing before him would be no more than gnats and flies—how could they evoke sorrow or joy?

The ancients, when their learning was sufficient, took office to benefit the people; emolument was but a substitute for tilling the soil, meant only to support one’s parents and raise one’s family. How different from the officials of later ages, who beyond their salaries extort and accumulate, indulging their ears, eyes, mouths, and bodies, yet never once visit their parents’ halls to inquire after them! Master Zeng rejoiced at three *fu* when his parents were alive, and grieved at three thousand *zhong* when they were gone—his sorrow and joy were bound to their presence or absence, not to the abundance or meagerness of emolument. Yet his heart was not immune to transformation, which is why his disciples questioned him.

The Master said that Shen, caught between these two, could not be free of entanglement: the presence or absence of his parents inevitably bound him, but the abundance or meagerness of emolument should not have lingered in his heart. If one were truly unbound, how could sorrow arise? To him, *zhong* and *fu* would be but gnats and flies. Master Zeng’s filial conduct is renowned through the ages, yet his office and emolument of three thousand *zhong* are unrecorded. This parable in the *Nanhua* also reflects the intent to hold the worthy to account, urging people to value filial conduct over office and emolument, to accept whether parents are provided for or not, whether emolument reaches them or not, as a matter of fate—then where is the entanglement?

Yan Chengzi You said to Shu Guo Zijing: "Since I heard your words, after one year I became rustic; after two, compliant; after three, penetrating; after four, in harmony with things; after five, things came to me; after six, spirits entered; after seven, Heaven was accomplished; after eight, I knew not death, knew not life; after nine, I attained the Great Mystery. Life is action; death is admonition. I urge you: take heed of death."

There is that from which the self arises; life and yang emerge from it. There is that from which nothing arises. How then can this be so? Whither does it find its fitting place? Whither does it find none? Heaven has its celestial reckonings, earth has its human settlements—where should I seek them? None knows its end; how then could there be no fate? None knows its beginning; how then could there be fate? When there is that by which things respond, how could there be no spirits? When there is nothing by which things respond, how could there be spirits?

Guo’s annotation: "Rustic" means beyond external gains. "Compliant" means not acting on one’s own. "Penetrating" means understanding others. "In harmony with things" means that what comes with me is self-attainment. "Spirits enter" means transcending the bodily form. "Heaven is accomplished" means non-action. "Knowing not death, knowing not life" means all encounters are fitting. "The Great Mystery" means good and evil are the same. Thus, there is nowhere one does not merge into obscurity. This speaks of long study and hearing the Dao, knowing the spontaneity of Heaven’s piping; one will suddenly forget oneself, and impurities will daily recede until they are gone entirely.

Life with action loses its life. From action comes death; from prizing one’s life comes action. Now, what urges you is that death arises from prizing the self. The yang of life, once it severs all pursuit and action, suddenly stands alone—yet not from any cause. And yet it is indeed so. Thus, there is no fitting place and no unfitting place, and only then are all places fitting, all fitting in their attainment.

Heaven and earth are already self-sufficient; principle must complete itself, not through knowledge—how then could it not be fate? Not knowing why it is so yet finding it so is called fate. It seems as though there were intent, so fate’s name is discarded to clarify its spontaneity, and only then is the principle of fate complete. Principle has responses as though there were numinous spirits, yet principle responds of itself, not through any cause—thus, though there is response, there is no spirit.

Lü’s annotation: The Dao was never a thing; once it has become a thing and one desires to return to non-thing, then attaining emptiness and preserving stillness is not the work of a single morning. "Rustic" means forgetting benevolence and righteousness, guests and ritual music. "Compliant" means the heart’s non-resistance. "Penetrating" means the heart’s thoroughness with things, so that in every thing one roams, in every thing one observes. "Things come" means the Dao gathers to one. "Spirits enter" means spirits and gods come to dwell. "Heaven is accomplished" (six versions all lack this phrase). "Knowing not death, knowing not life" means knowing to stop at what one does not know. "The Great Mystery" means spirit. Speaking of the mystery of the myriad things, only then can one embody spirit.

Life without action knows neither life nor death. Life with action brings death. Urging one toward impartiality and away from self-interest, one comes to know no death. Life with action is the source of death, so the sage puts the self aside and thereby preserves it. By being without self-interest, one perfects one’s self-interest—this is how one urges you. Tracing beginnings and ends, one knows the discourse on life and death. Beginning and end are like a ring: there is only life’s yang—how could there be any source? Taking action as the self is also speaking of the nature of things.

How then can this be so? Thus, one who embodies the Dao and exhausts the spirit knows neither death nor life—how could there be a fitting or unfitting place? To seek it in celestial reckonings and human settlements is never to find common ground. How much less should one seek it in questions of fortune and misfortune, human affairs! To deem it no fate? Yet in the end, there seems to be constraint. To deem it fate? Yet its beginning cannot be found. To deem it no spirits? Yet there is that by which things respond. To deem it spirits? Yet there is nothing by which things respond. Thus, one stops at what one does not know and admits no concerns—this is attainment.

Yi Du’s annotation: "Rustic" means unadorned. "Compliant" means non-resistance. "Penetrating" means no obstruction. "Things" means forgetting the self. "Things come" means they do not depart. "Spirits enter" means returning to numinosity. "Heaven is accomplished" means uniting virtue with Heaven. "Knowing not death, knowing not life" is sageliness. "The Great Mystery" is spirit. In reaching spirit, one attains the ultimate!

This is the sequence by which learners enter the Dao. Human life with action burdens its life, and thus death arises from prizing one’s life. Therefore, the purpose of urging you toward action is that death arises from prizing the self. As for fate, it is the great commonality of things. Impartial and without self-interest, one knows no death. Life is yang, death is yin. Knowing life and death as one with yin and yang, there is no self. Truly knowing this principle, life is not worth delight, death is not worth sorrow—then where is there fitting or unfitting?

Celestial reckonings are Heaven’s images; human settlements are Earth’s vessels. Humans dwell between the two, and the Dao of Heaven and Earth is sought in the self alone. Fate is the Dao of Heaven; spirits are the Dao of humans. Beginning and end speak of the Heavenly Dao; response speaks of the human Dao. When Heaven and human communicate, the principles of yin and yang, life and fate are complete. Placing it between being and non-being and doubting it—this is profound understanding of the Dao.

Bi Xu’s annotation: "Rustic" means the initial heart’s simplicity. "Compliant" means not resisting others’ feelings. "Penetrating" means thoroughness with principle, no obstruction. "Things" means unity in undifferentiated wholeness. "Things come" means the multitude returns to one’s virtue. "Spirits enter" means profound attainment of the obscure. "Heaven is accomplished" means non-action and spontaneity. "Knowing not death, knowing not life" means being and non-being are one. The "Great Mystery" at nine years means the number exhausts pure yang, and spiritual transformation is unfathomable.

Life with action moves toward the place of death. Because of prizing the self, one urges impartiality. Those who turn from impartiality toward self-interest die from self-interest—how could their death be without cause? Life is the qi of strong yang, without any source. Can you truly reach the Great Mystery? The Great Mystery is without impartiality or self-interest, without life or death, without fitting or unfitting place—it may be called the ultimate! In Heaven, images are formed, and celestial reckonings may be calculated.

On earth, forms take shape, and human reckoning may discern them. Only I am without mind—who can fathom this? Some affairs have a beginning but no end, others an end but no beginning—all are as Heaven’s mandate ordains.

"Correspondence" refers to the nine verifications of prior Dao-cultivation. "Spirits" denote numinous echoes—some responsive, some not—depending on the depth of practice and the swiftness of spiritual communion. Though Dao-cultivation follows a sequence, its essence lies in solitary transformation. As for its duration, nine years may be the measure, yet enlightenment may strike in a single dawn or dusk.

*Yanzhai’s Oral Exegesis*:
"Wild" means returning to simplicity.
"Following" means aligning with others without losing oneself.
"Permeation" means thorough illumination.
"Things" are like withered wood or dead ashes.
"Coming" denotes that within stillness, something indestructible remains.
"Spiritual entry" means embracing the transformations of creation within one’s breast.
"Heaven-accomplished" means merging with Heaven as one.
"Not knowing life and death" means being at ease in every circumstance.
"The Great Mystery" is the utmost profundity.
From one to nine, these are but stages—this matter cannot be measured in years.

People take life as having a beginning, clinging to self-interest. Thus, they are exhorted with the principle of impartiality, that they may know no thing in the world is deathless. If one speaks of death, it must have a source. Yet if one seeks the origin of life, it has no source—if there is no birth at the outset, how can there be death? Yang is the inception of movement. Speaking thus of life and death, who can say whether it is truly so?

"Fitting or unfitting" is like saying "so or not so." Observing to the utmost, one finds that "so or not so" cannot be fixed. Can celestial reckonings and human discernment fully exhaust the principles of Heaven and Earth? The myriad affairs and transformations of the world are wrought by the Creator—how can one say there is no mandate? Yet in the primordial vastness, originally nothing existed—how can one say there is a mandate? Cold and heat, dawn and dusk arrive in season, qi responds in time—how can one say there are no spirits? Humility does not always bring fortune, benevolence does not always bring longevity—how can one say there are spirits? This speaks to the unknowability of the Creator.

Human life withers with convention, losing itself day by day. Those who cultivate the Dao reduce and reduce again, seeking to return to their origin. "Wild" means gradually reverting to simplicity. "Following" means aligning with others without losing oneself. "Permeation" means penetrating principle. "Things" means forgetting the self. "Coming" means others are drawn to one. "Spiritual entry" means entering the realm of the indistinct. "Heaven-accomplished" means harmonizing with spontaneity. "Not knowing life and death" means neither going nor coming. The "Great Mystery" at nine years means the number reaches the subtlest, and spiritual transformation is unfathomable.

Only by taking non-action as one’s foundation can one ascend to this realm. Yet the world is mired in action, hastening toward the place of death. They are exhorted to impartiality because death arises from self-interest. The *Bixu Zhaozhang* edition, collated by Zhang Junfang, ends the sentence with "self-interest," which refers to prizing and pampering one’s life excessively. What one seeks to benefit oneself instead brings the greatest harm. Thus, one is urged to abandon it and return to the impartial Way.

Death follows from taking life as existent. Life itself begins from nothingness. If one originates from nothingness and is without self-interest, then there is also no death—Heaven cannot kill, Earth cannot bury. Can you truly be thus? From this, one knows that those who do not take life as existent are wiser than those who prize life—how then can one speak of fitting or unfitting?

Heaven has its reckonings, by which fortune and misfortune may be deduced. Earth has its human discernment, by which order and chaos may be examined. What need have I to seek elsewhere? Since the division of the Two Modes, myriad things have been born for thousands upon thousands of years without end—if not for mandate, how could this be? Yet things are transformed without known beginning—from what could mandate arise?

Celestial reckonings and human discernment show correspondences of fortune and misfortune—how can there be no spirits? Yet Heaven’s Way sometimes defies certainty, and human affairs sometimes lack constancy—thus, one may doubt the existence of spirits. This speaks to the subtlety of creation, so difficult to perceive that its very elusiveness defines it. One can only fulfill one’s duty and await its unfolding. Thus, the highest learning turns one inward to examine oneself.

The beginning and end of Heaven and Earth, the concealment and revelation of the numinous within oneself—exhausting one’s nature to reach destiny, illuminating spirits to attain the divine—all lie in diligent practice and heartfelt realization. What need is there to wait nine years?

The multitude of shadowy companions asked the shadow: "Before, you bowed; now, you raise your head. Before, your hair was bound; now, it is loose. Before, you sat; now, you stand. Before, you walked; now, you stop. Why?" The shadow replied: "Such trifles—why ask? I act, yet know not why. I am like the cicada’s molted husk, the snake’s sloughed skin—resembling yet not the same. Fire and sunlight are my gathering; darkness and night are my replacement."

Do I depend on something to exist thus? How much more so for those that depend on something! When it comes, I come with it; when it goes, I go with it; when it is strong and bright, I am strong and bright with it. What question can there be of the strong and bright?

As Guo’s commentary states: movement is spontaneous, with nothing to question. It is spontaneous, thus one knows not why. The husk resembles the cicada, the slough resembles the snake, the shadow resembles the form yet is not the form—pushing this to its limit, what we now call the dependent ultimately reaches the non-dependent, and the principle of solitary transformation becomes manifest. It is merely vigorous, spontaneous movement, following and accompanying to and fro. Without intention, it cannot be questioned.

As Lü’s commentary states: The shadowy companions arise from the shadow, and the faint yin beyond the shadow is not singular—hence "trifling." The shadow’s bowing and raising, walking and stopping, follow the person alone—how could it know why? The form’s having a shadow is like the cicada’s husk or the snake’s slough, yet it is not the husk or slough. The shadow gathers and appears with fire and sunlight, and is replaced and concealed by darkness and night. This is what the shadow depends on to be a shadow, yet being without sentiment, how could it know of dependence? What the shadow depends on—fire, sunlight, darkness, and night—cannot be called dependent; how much less so for that which depends on something! What depends on something is that from which the shadow arises—namely, the form. Knowing the shadowy companions are non-dependent, we know the shadow is non-dependent; knowing the shadow is non-dependent, we know that from which the shadow arises is also non-dependent—thus it is not burdened by the form! When it comes and goes, I come and go with it; when it is strong and bright, I am strong and bright with it—none of this is me. What question can there be?

As Du’s commentary states: "Trifling" refers to the multitude of shadowy companions. "Why ask?" means there is no need to ask. All things created by the Maker depend on something yet know not why.

The carapace resembles the cicada, the slough resembles the snake, the shadow resembles the form—yet they are not the cicada, the snake, or the form. Fire and sunlight cast light, where shadows gather; darkness and night hold no light, where shadows hide. This is what I depend upon—how much more so for the form, which itself depends on something? It means dependence on the workings of creation. When the form comes, I come with it; when the form goes, I go with it; when the form is strong and bright, I am strong and bright with it—all this arises from spontaneous transformation. What question could there be?

Bi Xu’s *Annotation of the Single Lamp* states: One lamp, one shadow; ten lamps, ten shadows. As lamps and shadows multiply, faint shades grow numerous. Does their rising and falling arise from the form’s command, or do shadows arise naturally? Their movement and stillness, their presence and absence—none can know their cause. Shadows and faint shades have form yet no obstruction; cicada carapaces and snake sloughed skins have substance yet no nature. Before shedding, only the snake and cicada exist; once shed, the carapace and skin remain of themselves. Thus the shadow and the form do not depend on each other—how much less do the cicada and snake regard their sloughed remains! The world says the form gives birth to the shadow, the shadow gives birth to faint shades. Yet when the shadow arises, it gathers in sunlight and fire, and is replaced by darkness and night—what does it owe to the form? When the form stands in light, the shadow appears, seeming dependent; when it dwells in darkness, the shadow vanishes, seeming independent. Though its coming and going, its movement, arise from the other, its response without intent lies within oneself. Where is there room for inquiry?

*Yanzhai’s Oral Teachings* states: *Sousou* sounds like *xiao*, a state of being half-hidden, half-revealed. *Shao* means "roughly" or "generally." It speaks of what you possess, yet you do not know its origin.

The cicada has transformed, yet its shell remains; the snake has transformed, yet its slough remains. This analogy—comparing the moving form to the cicada or snake, and the shadow to the shell or slough—only *seems* apt, but is not. When an object meets sunlight or fire, its shadow gathers; when night falls, the shadow is replaced. That "other" (referring to the form and shadow as if they were distinct) claims to be independent—how could it be what I depend upon? Yet the form’s movement, too, has its dependencies. How much more so for those that rely on what is conditional?

The form moves only when stirred by the *qi* of strong yang, and I follow along. But what constitutes strong yang lies beyond the form’s knowing—why then do you ask me? This passage aligns with the *Qi Wu Lun*, though it adds the theory of sunlight, fire, and strong yang.

All things under heaven with form must cast shadows—this is universally known. Yet beyond the shadow lies the faint shade called *wangliang*, which most fail to perceive. For the shadow, being dim, clings ambiguously to its source, its obscurity giving rise to shifting, overlapping shades—hence the term "multitudes of *wangliang*." The *wangliang*’s relation to form is like the seven emotions’ relation to the heart: when the heart is not governed, the seven emotions run rampant, turning to assail it; when the shadow is unclear, the *wangliang* proliferate, turning to interrogate it. Yet what the shadow depends upon—can the *wangliang* comprehend it? What the heart obscures—can the seven emotions grasp it?

This discourse on the mutual arising of natural principles resembles the interplay of dependence and conditionality, where things may exist or vanish. Neither dependent nor independent, it serves as a metaphor for the origin of form and the inception of thought. The insight is exquisitely subtle, unarticulated by past sages.

The shadow arises from the form, yet without sunlight or fire, it cannot be seen—seeming interdependent. Though sunlight and fire are luminous, without form there would be no shadow—this is the principle of *duhua* (self-transformation). The shadow clings to the form, never parting in movement or stillness, as close as one’s own body. Its activity and quiescence, its presence and absence, must have a master. Yet people go about their days unaware, so the *wangliang*’s questioning is hardly surprising!

The *Qi Wu Lun* states: *"As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found."* This precisely clarifies the point. The so-called "true master" is the lord of *duhua*, upon which the ten thousand things and forms rely for generation and movement, and from which the interplay of dependence and conditionality arises. If one can turn inward to seek it, then amid the vague and indistinct, clarity and harmony emerge. The principle of *duhua* becomes evident, and the doubts of *wangliang* dissolve.

"Strong yang" refers to the *qi* of creation that humans receive, enabling the body to move and manipulate external things. Its gathering brings existence; its dispersal brings dissolution—it is but a temporary lodging. If one knows the lord of *duhua*, then the true self endures, and the gathering and scattering of that *qi* need not be questioned. How much less the faint shades beyond the shadow?

When Yang Ziju was traveling south to Pei, and Lao Dan was journeying west to Qin, they met by chance at Liang. Midway, Laozi looked up to the sky and sighed: "At first, I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot." Yang Ziju made no reply. Upon reaching their lodging, he presented water for washing, a towel, and a comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: "Earlier, your disciple wished to ask you a question, but you were walking and did not respond, so I dared not speak. Now that you have stopped, I beg to ask where I have erred."

Laozi said: "Your haughty and overbearing demeanor—who would wish to dwell with you? The purest white appears sullied; the greatest virtue seems insufficient."

Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: "I humbly receive your instruction."

On his previous journey, the innkeeper had welcomed him, the master of the house had laid out the mat, his wife had held the towel and comb, the guests had yielded their seats, and the cook had stepped away from the hearth. On his return, the innkeeper vied with him for a seat.

Guo Xiang’s commentary: *"Sui sui xu xu"* describes an overbearing manner. People will shrink from difficulty and distance themselves; when one exalts oneself, others defer—hence the cook stepped aside.

Lu Huiqing’s commentary: His *sui xu* self-importance prompted the innkeeper’s obsequious welcome. Laozi sighed at Ziju’s ostentatious display, which led to shoes crowding the doorway. Bo Hun’s departure from Yu Kou followed the same principle.

Yi Du’s commentary: Ziju was Yang Zhu’s courtesy name. His washing, combing, and kneeling demonstrated his self-purification and humility. *"Sui sui xu xu"* revealed his arrogance outwardly. "Who would dwell with you?" admonished him that the sage knows purity yet guards obscurity—thus the purest white seems sullied, and the fullest virtue seems insufficient. Ziju heard this and awakened.

On his earlier journey, the innkeeper had welcomed him with ceremony, the host had laid out the mat, his wife had held the towel and comb, the guests had yielded their seats, and the cook had stepped away from the hearth—all out of respect for his outward display. Upon hearing the Dao and shedding his pretensions, on his return the innkeeper vied with him for a seat. Without displaying superiority, how could others know to revere him?

Bi Xu’s commentary: *"Sui xu"* describes a haughty bearing. On his first journey, his pomp and ceremony inspired awe. On his return, he appeared no different from the common folk, making others forget his distinction.

*Yanzhai* states: *"Sui xu"* denotes self-importance, the failure to forget self and others. It is as if one were dwelling with others. "The master of the house" refers to the innkeeper. "Yang" means "to cook." Yielding seats and hearths expressed respect; vying for a seat showed that his distinction was no longer recognized. Having been enlightened by Lao Dan, he withdrew into obscurity, and others treated him as ordinary.

*"Sui xu"*—self-importance—who would wish to dwell with you? One whose conduct is pure will be slandered, so they conceal their brilliance as if sullied. One whose virtue is abundant will be diminished, so they nurture it as if insufficient. This is the way to preserve oneself. Now you do the opposite—how could you be taught? Ziju heard this and was dismayed; his expression changed, revealing his remorse. Thus, on his earlier journey, the innkeeper had welcomed him, the master of the house had laid out the mat, his wife had held the towel and comb—everyone in the household had shown him respect.

Leaving one’s seat and avoiding the hearth—such conduct astonished all who witnessed it. Yet upon his return, the inn’s guests vied for a place beside him, for his pretenses had fallen away and his true nature remained, causing others to forget the crude displays of outward respect. This is why the ancients could enter a herd of beasts without disturbing them or join a flock of birds without disrupting their flight.

This chapter takes its title from a parable, embodying the spirit of the Old Immortal of Nanhua, who crossed water without wetting his feet. Though his words were many, he feared later generations might cling to traces and fall into error, so with each step he swept away his own advances. His parables and reiterations were but expedients, borrowed from external discourse out of necessity.

The *zhiyan*—like water held in a vessel—is restrained yet never lost, and when it flows forth, it does so without weariness. Differences and judgments each have their place; speech arising from wordlessness is no different from silence. Whether affirmed or accepted depends on the inclinations of the world—how could one know whether it is inherently so or merely deemed so? Thus, only in wordlessness can all be made equal.

Alas, in an age of declining Dao and fading virtue, none trust themselves, and those unable to fulfill their aspirations in their own time still hope to leave teachings for the future. Yet they fear there will be nothing to guide later generations, so they embed their message in what is esteemed to gain trust. By leading others through parables to seek the truth, and through subtle allusions to ascend to the profound, their success is one and the same.

As for the Master’s teachings, they evolved with the times—what was right at the outset may not be so at the end. If even the truths of one’s own life cannot remain constant, how can one expect to be unquestionably believed by later ages? When Zengzi took office twice and changed twice, his heart was not free from attachment, and joy and sorrow manifested in him, whether his motives were for his parents or for his stipend.

But one who hears the words and awakens—like Ziyou, who in a single year became as unrefined as the wilds—reaches the great mystery: the heart grows ever emptier, and the Dao ever more present. The parables, reiterations, and *zhiyan* all reside in the realm of transformative influence.

Next, the discussion turns to the presence or absence of fate and spirits, and the interdependence of form and shadow, all to illuminate the ineffable wonders of creation. If one fully embodies what creation bestows and does not resist its course, then the heaven and earth within oneself become as unfathomable as the most wondrous of things.

The conclusion—with "Sui xu" in his arrogance, who would wish to dwell with him? Yet upon hearing the teaching and returning, the inn’s guests vied for a place beside him—shows that enlightenment comes in an instant, with but a few words heard by the ear and grasped by the heart. Who could say that those who bear the Dao will leave no one for later generations to forget the fish-trap once the fish is caught?

I have read Su Dongpo’s *Record of the Zhuangzi Shrine*, in which he argues that the end of the "Parables" chapter should connect to the beginning of "Lie Yukou," and that the four chapters "Yielding the Throne," "Robber Zhi," "Discourse on Swords," and "The Old Fisherman" should be removed. While the two chapters might share a coherent meaning, the exclusion of four seems excessive. His objection likely stems from "Yielding the Throne" being overly detailed and repetitive, "Robber Zhi" slandering Confucius too harshly, "Discourse on Swords" resembling the rhetoric of the School of Diplomacy, and "The Old Fisherman" bordering on defamation of the Sage. Thus, these were not favored by Master Su.

Yet in the *Record*, he also states that Zhuangzi’s words may not align with his intent, outwardly rejecting while subtly aiding—thus revealing his understanding of Zhuangzi’s original purpose in using words to remedy the age’s ills. Why, then, take offense at their roughness?

Upon examination, the four chapters—"Yielding the Throne" and the others—seem somewhat distinct from the inner and outer sections, though their essential message does not stray from the fundamental principle. The difference lies in the coarseness or refinement of their expression, and the variations in emphasis. Perhaps they were later additions by disciples who failed to capture the purity of the original, hence their placement at the end of the miscellaneous sections. Yet their meaning can still be grasped, and there is no harm in it.

Leaving one’s seat and avoiding the hearth are outward displays of self-importance, prompting others to show respect. But upon hearing the Dao and shedding such pretenses, the inn’s guests vied for a place beside him, no longer displaying deference. Without showing others how to advance, they knew not how to respect him.

The *Bixu Commentary* notes: "Sui xu" refers to an arrogant demeanor. On his earlier journey, his bearing was imposing, inspiring awe in others. Upon his return, he appeared no different from the common folk, causing others to forget his presence.

The *Yanzhai* states: "Sui xu" denotes self-importance, where the distinction between self and others is not forgotten. It is as if one were merely dwelling among people.

The master of the house refers to the innkeeper. *Yang* means to cook. Avoiding the inn and the hearth were signs of respect. Vying for a seat showed that his distinction was no longer recognized. Having been enlightened by Lao Dan, he withdrew into obscurity, and others treated him as ordinary.

"Sui xu"—self-importance—who would wish to dwell with you? One whose conduct is pure will be slandered, so they conceal their brilliance as if sullied. One whose virtue is abundant will be diminished, so they nurture it as if insufficient. This is the way to preserve oneself. Now you do the opposite—how could you be taught? Ziju heard this and was dismayed; his expression changed, revealing his remorse. Thus, on his earlier journey, the innkeeper had welcomed him, the master of the house had laid out the mat, his wife had held the towel and comb—everyone in the household had shown him respect.

Leaving one’s seat and avoiding the hearth—such conduct astonished all who witnessed it. Yet upon his return, the inn’s guests vied for a place beside him, for his pretenses had fallen away and his true nature remained, causing others to forget the crude displays of outward respect. This is why the ancients could enter a herd of beasts without disturbing them or join a flock of birds without disrupting their flight.

This chapter takes its title from a parable, embodying the spirit of the Old Immortal of Nanhua, who crossed water without wetting his feet.

Such being so and permissible, it is but the acceptance or rejection of worldly sentiments. How can one know whether it is inherently so or inherently permissible? Thus, only in silence can all be made equal.

Alas, in an age of declining Dao and fading virtue, none trust themselves, and unable to fulfill their aspirations in their own time, they yet hope to leave teachings for posterity. Fearing there would be no means to bind the understanding of later generations, they embed their message in what is esteemed to gain credence. By guiding others through allegory to fathom the truth, and through subtle allusions to ascend to the sublime, their achievement is one and the same.

As for the Master’s progression—adapting with the times, beginning with what is right and ending with what is not—even the rightness of one’s own era cannot endure, how much less can one expect unchanging belief from later ages? Even Master Zeng, who twice entered and twice left office, could not free his heart from attachment, and joy and sorrow manifested therein, whether for family or for stipend.

Yet those who hear the words and awaken—like Ziyou, who in a single year became rustic and attained the great mystery—find their hearts growing ever more empty as the Dao gathers within. The allegories, reiterations, and impromptu words all reside in the realm of transformative influence.

Next, the discourse on fate and the presence or absence of spirits, on form and shadow and their interdependence, all illuminate the ineffable subtleties of creation. If one can fully embody what creation bestows, without obstruction or distortion, then the unfathomable numen within one’s own body is no different from that of heaven and earth.

The conclusion—with its sighs of pride and aloofness, asking who could dwell with such a one—ends with the parable of hearing the teaching and turning back, where those who once vied for seats now forget their pretenses. In the space of a few words, the ear listens and the heart awakens. Who would claim that those who bear the Dao for later generations would fail to grasp the fish while forgetting the trap?

I once read Su Shi’s *Record of the Zhuangzi Shrine*, in which he argued that the end of the "Allegories" chapter should connect to the beginning of "Lie Yukou," and that the four chapters "Yielding the Throne," "Robber Zhi," "Discourse on Swords," and "The Old Fisherman" should be excised. While the two chapters might share a coherent meaning, the rejection of the four seems excessive. His objections likely stemmed from the following: "Yielding the Throne" is overly detailed and repetitive in its arguments; "Robber Zhi" slanders Confucius to excess; "Discourse on Swords" resembles the rhetoric of the Strategists; and "The Old Fisherman" nearly amounts to slander of the Sage. Thus, these were not favored by Master Su.

Yet in the same *Record*, he also wrote that Zhuangzi’s words are true in substance though not in style, outwardly repelling yet inwardly aiding—thus revealing his insight into Zhuangzi’s fundamental intent in using words to remedy the ills of the age. Why then take offense at their roughness?

Upon examination, these four chapters—"Yielding the Throne" and the others—differ somewhat from the Inner and Outer Sections, as if in dialogue. Yet their essential message does not stray from the great foundation. The distinction lies in the varying degrees of refinement and emphasis in their expression; some may have been supplements by disciples, lacking the purity of the original, hence their placement at the end of the Miscellaneous Sections. Their meaning can be grasped intuitively without need for further debate to forestall later doubts.

The *Wulin* Daoist Chu Boxiu’s Study:
*Yielding the Throne, Chapter One*

Yao yielded the realm to Xu You, but Xu You declined. He then yielded it to Zizhou Zhi Fu, who replied: “That you would make me Son of Heaven is acceptable. Nevertheless, I presently suffer from a hidden sorrow, and am occupied with its cure—thus I have no leisure to govern the realm. The realm is the weightiest of burdens, yet one must not allow it to harm one’s life—how much less should other things do so! Only he who takes no account of the realm may be entrusted with it.”

Shun yielded the realm to Zizhou Zhi Bo, who said: “I presently suffer from a hidden sorrow, and am occupied with its cure—thus I have no leisure to govern the realm.” The realm is a vessel of great magnitude, yet one must not exchange life for it—this is how those who embody the Way differ from the common world.

Shun yielded the realm to Shan Juan, who replied: “I stand amid the cosmos: in winter I wear furs and pelts, in summer garments of fine hemp. In spring I till and sow, my form sufficient for labor; in autumn I gather the harvest, my body sufficient for rest.”

With the sun’s rise, I labor; with its setting, I rest—roaming free between heaven and earth, my heart content. Why should I take the realm for myself? Alas, you do not know me at all!

Thereupon he departed and entered the deep mountains, where none knew his whereabouts.

Shun yielded the realm to his friend, the farmer of Stone Gate, who said: “How earnest is the lord’s conduct! A man who preserves his strength!” Yet he deemed Shun’s virtue still incomplete. Thus, husband carrying on his back, wife bearing on her head, they led their child into the sea and never returned.

Lord Guju of Deng dwelt in Deng when the Di tribes attacked. He offered them furs and silks, but they would not accept; he offered them dogs and horses, but they would not accept; he offered them pearls and jades, but they would not accept—for what the Di sought was land.

Lord Guju said: “To dwell with a man’s elder brother and kill his younger brother, to dwell with a man’s father and kill his son—this I cannot bear. All of you, do your best to remain! What difference is there between serving me and serving the Di?” He then took up his staff and departed. The people followed in such numbers that they formed a state beneath Mount Qi.

Lord Guju may indeed be called one who honored life. Those who honor life, though noble and wealthy, do not allow their nurture to harm their bodies; though poor and lowly, they do not allow profit to burden their forms. Yet men of this age who occupy high office and exalted rank all fear losing them, and at the sight of gain lightly forfeit their lives—how deluded they are!

The people of Yue murdered their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, distressed by this, fled into the cinnabar caves. When Yue was left without a ruler, they sought Prince Sou but could not find him, so they pursued him to the cinnabar caves. Prince Sou refused to emerge, so the people of Yue smoked him out with mugwort and bore him forth in a jade carriage. Prince Sou grasped the carriage strap to mount, then looked up to heaven and cried: “Rulership! Rulership! Can you truly not spare me?”

Prince Sou did not despise being ruler—he despised the troubles that come with rulership. Such a man may indeed be called one who did not allow the realm to harm his life. This is why the people of Yue desired him as their ruler.

Guo’s commentary is brief and does not elaborate. Lü’s commentary: In the late years of the Three Dynasties, fathers and sons, brothers and kin contended for the realm, each bringing ruin upon the other—so it is said, “The knight endangers his body and lightly risks his life to seek favor.” This is why the *Yielding the Realm* chapter was composed.

Xu You, Zhi Fu, and their like all refused to exchange their lives for the realm. Yang Xiong believed that the weight of Yao’s abdication to Shun was not taken lightly by such men. Does this not mean that the worthy must be tested through experience before the realm is entrusted to them? Yet they fail to understand that what enabled Yao to obtain Shun was not such testing—for testing is common to all men, and merely exposes one to the world. Had Xu You not shunned Yao’s offer, how could one know he would not have proven equal to Shun?

Du’s commentary: Sorrow concealed in the heart is called “hidden sorrow.” Zhi Fu did not allow the realm to harm his life; Zhi Bo did not exchange his life for the realm. Though they differed from the common world, they were not yet free of intent.

Shan Juan illustrated the depth of his embrace of the Way; the farmer of Stone Gate was skilled in closure and revered the root. Shan Juan’s words sought self-preservation for his own sake, while the farmer pointed to the lord’s conduct—deeming his virtue incomplete, neither was yet able to be without preference.

Lord Xuan of Deng fled the Di, unwilling to harm the people for the sake of land—he may indeed be called one who honored life. Yet to have a body is to require nurture; to have life is to bear burdens. The wealthy and noble delight in nurture, but excess nurture harms the body; the poor and lowly are pressed by profit, and excess profit burdens the form. Only by avoiding these two extremes can one honor life.

Prince Sou fled the throne—he may indeed be called one who did not allow the realm to harm his life. Though not entangled by external things, his love for the people and himself remained, so he was still bound, unable to be without striving. These are but traces of the sage, not his true essence.

The true essence of the sage is to forget life yet have life perfectly preserved, to forget nurture yet have nurture fully realized. Though entrusted with the realm and the state, he simply accords with the moment—what harm could there be?

Bi Xu’s commentary: He who sets the realm aside is untouched by the world’s harms. He who values his life is unmoved by other things. Only with a heart vast and empty can one entrust oneself to the four seas. The great virtue of heaven and earth is life itself—what the perfected man treasures. Who would trade it for the realm? Clad in coarse robes, nourished by simple gruel, who would make external things their concern and lose their natural purity?

Thus, the unyielding will not bend to others; only the deeply virtuous can truly honor what is beneath them.

The steadfast integrity that preserves one’s strength establishes great merit; the unrestrained and unrepentant provoke reproach and contempt. The earth provides sustenance to nurture all things; what nurtures things in turn nurtures the people. Now, to contend over the very things that sustain life and thereby harm the people they nourish—this the sage cannot bear to do.

The weight of wealth and rank lies in their power to injure the body through excess nurture; the lightness of poverty and lowliness lies in their tendency to destroy the body through the pursuit of profit. Thus, to rule as a lord yet let governance falter is not so good as retiring into reclusion to preserve oneself whole.

*Juanzhai’s note:* The "hidden sorrow" of illness is like a concealed malady. He who takes no thought for the realm may be entrusted with it, possessing it yet not clinging to it.

*Juanjuan* (pronounced *quan*), an appearance of self-exertion. *Baoli*, to labor strenuously. The two passages on Yao and Shun lack concluding remarks, their meaning being the same as before. "Used for nurture" refers to the land; "what is nurtured" refers to the common people. Those who honor life hold the body in high regard and external things in low esteem—this is a rebuke to those of the time who feared loss. Only he who has no desire to rule may be entrusted with the state, which is why the people of Yue sought Prince Sou to be their lord.

*Chu’s Observations:* Heaven produces sages to continue the transmission of the Dao, clarify human relationships, assist heaven and earth, and nourish the myriad things. Whether the lord’s position exists or not is of no consequence to them. Yet as the pivot of governance and the destination of litigation, there are times when it cannot be refused—it is but a temporary entrustment. Though seated in the dignity of ten thousand chariots and the wealth of the four seas, they dwell in earthen-floored thatched huts, wear coarse garments, and eat simple fare, unaware of the weight of their power or the extremity of their station. Since they did not seek it with their hearts, they do not regard it as glory, and thus their refusals and relinquishments are as effortless as removing a shoe.

Nothing in the world is greater than the realm, yet to yield it is to have nothing left to contend for. What measure can fathom what lies within such a heart? Even when offered the realm and refusing it, how could this be the act of one without inner resolve? The virtue of Yao, Shun, and the Great King does not require praise; the lofty integrity of the various masters could only be fully revealed by Zhuangzi. Examining their words of refusal, the general intent is nothing more than esteeming life and devaluing external things, prizing the inner and despising the outer, delighting in the sage’s Way and loathing the burdens of lordship. Moreover, if the ancients disdained to accept the realm when offered, how could they stoop to the deceit, force, perversity, and overreaching of later ages?

*The "hidden sorrow" of illness:* According to the *Lüshi Chunqiu*, this passage is cited with Gao You’s commentary: "Hidden" means concealed. The *Book of Songs* says, "As if there were a concealed sorrow"—this refers to one so preoccupied with putting one’s own affairs in order that there is no leisure to govern the realm, which is what sets them apart from the common.

The Great King fled the Di tribes, unwilling to harm the people; Prince Sou of Yue fled the people, fearing harm to himself. Fearing harm to the people is to love oneself; fearing harm to oneself is to love the people. This is why the people of Yue wished to make him their lord—his virtue was manifest, and he did not flee like ants drawn to honey. As for the highest virtue, which does not act as virtue, the people cannot name it—it cannot be gained or harmed, transcending even this level. Though the *Nanhua* does not fully articulate this, its intent lies herein, as can be seen in the later chapters’ essential purport.

Han and Wei contended over encroached territory. Master Zihua met Marquis Zhaoxi, who wore a troubled expression. Master Zihua said: "Suppose the world inscribed a contract before you, its words reading: 'Grasp it with your left hand, and your right hand will be severed; grasp it with your right hand, and your left hand will be severed. Yet whoever grasps it shall possess the realm.' Would you grasp it?"

Marquis Zhaoxi said: "I would not."

Master Zihua said: "Excellent! From this we see that both arms are weightier than the realm, and the body is weightier still than both arms. How much lighter is Han than the realm, and how much lighter still is the territory now in dispute! Yet you grieve, harming your life and body over what you cannot obtain!"

Marquis Zhaoxi said: "Well said! Many have instructed me, but never have I heard such words. Master Zihua truly understands the weight of things."

*Guo’s commentary* omits discussion of this. *Lü’s commentary:* If Marquis Zhaoxi could heed Master Zihua’s words and regard his dispute as trivial, he would rank next to those who do not exchange their lives for the realm.

*Yi Zhu’s note:* "Severed" means cut off and rendered useless. Could one disregard one’s arms to seize the contract and gain the realm? The marquis said he would not, from which we know that both arms are weightier than the realm, and the body is weightier still than the arms. Compared to the realm, Han is already light, and the disputed land is lighter still than Han. Yet he grieves, harming his life and body over what he cannot obtain—abandoning what is most weighty to contend for what is most trivial. Is this not delusion?

*Bixu’s note:* Which is dearer, fame or the self? Which is greater, the self or wealth? Why trouble oneself over abandoned borderlands?

*The *Honglie* explains:* To slaughter warhorses in pursuit of foxes, to grasp two turtles while losing a sacred tortoise, to sever one’s right arm for a single hair, to break a fine sword in competition with a small blade—these are truly those who do not know the weight of things!

*Juanzhai’s note:* The contract is like an agreement. To grasp it is to gain the realm, yet one who cherishes life would not do so. How much lighter is Han compared to the realm! Yet to grieve over not obtaining it, even to the point of harming one’s life and body, is weightier than losing an arm!

The Marquis of Han contended with Wei over a small strip of encroached borderland, wearing his distress plainly. He could be said to value what is light and slight what is heavy. Though Wei’s ministers remonstrated, none were heeded. Master Hua entered and admonished him with reason: to grasp the contract with the left hand would sever the right; to grasp it with the right would sever the left—one cannot avoid both gain and harm. It lies with the individual to weigh their lightness and heaviness and choose accordingly.

The Marquis understood that an arm is weightier than the realm, and the body weightier still than an arm, yet he did not perceive that Han was lighter than the realm, and the contested encroached land lighter still than Han. Once the lightness is clearly discerned, the weight becomes self-evident.

The Marquis, upon hearing the admonition, swiftly awakened and grasped the natural order of light and heavy. Alas! The Marquis of Han was indeed worthy! And Master Hua, too, was wise!

The Lord of Lu had heard that Yan He was a man who had attained the Way, so he sent an envoy bearing gifts to precede his visit. Yan He dwelt in a humble abode, wearing coarse cloth and tending cattle himself. When the envoy from Lu arrived, Yan He received him in person. The envoy asked, "Is this the home of Yan He?" He replied, "This is indeed my home." The envoy presented the gifts, but Yan He said, "I fear a mishearing may bring blame upon the envoy; it would be better to verify." The envoy returned, confirmed the matter, and came again to seek him, but Yan He could not be found.

Such was Yan He—one who truly despised wealth and honor. Thus it is said: The true essence of the Way is for cultivating the self; its remnants may be used to govern the state; its dregs may be employed to order the world. From this perspective, the achievements of emperors and kings are but the leftover affairs of sages, not the means to preserve the body and nurture life.

Yet today, the gentlemen of the俗世 often endanger their bodies and forsake their lives in pursuit of external things—how lamentable! Whenever the sage acts, he must examine both his purpose and his means. Consider this: if a man were to use the pearl of Marquis Sui to shoot a sparrow soaring a thousand *ren* high, the world would surely mock him. Why? Because what he employs is weighty, while what he seeks is light. How much more so is life itself, which far surpasses the pearl of Marquis Sui in value!

The *Guo Commentary* omits this, and the *Lü Commentary* does not elaborate further.

**Yi Du’s Annotation:**
Yan He dwelled in poverty yet attained enlightenment; he truly despised wealth and honor, which is why Zhuangzi esteemed him. Those who grasp the true essence of the Dao cannot be spoken of in terms of life and death—thus, one may hear the Dao in the morning and die by evening. Yet when one cherishes and values the body for the sake of the world, this becomes the path of the sage. The remnants of silk threads, the basest of earth and grass—trifling and unworthy of mention—are what the sage employs for the world’s advancement, merely a temporary lodging for the world’s affairs. Thus, they are called "leftover matters." The *so*-of-its-purpose and the *so*-of-its-means: when one acts, one must examine its rightness before responding. The parable of the Marquis of Sui’s pearl shooting a sparrow illustrates how worldly men exchange life for wealth and honor, forsaking the weighty for the light.

**Bixu’s Annotation:**
"Remnants of threads" and "worthless as dirt" describe how the farther one strays from the self, the coarser one becomes. The sage in cultivating the self empties the heart and weakens the will. The emperor and king in establishing merit wield tools and tread paths. To view merit-making alongside self-cultivation is but a leftover of the self. Yan He knew that the *so*-of-its-purpose was not yet right, nor the *so*-of-its-means necessarily so—thus, he refused the gifts. There are scholars who savor the bitterness of herbs yet scorn wealth and honor, whose bodies may bend but whose Dao cannot, who value themselves as the pearl of Marquis Sui and regard rank and emolument as lightly as swallows and sparrows.

**Yuanzhai’s Remarks:**
"Remnants of threads" and "worthless as dirt" for governing the state and the world are the discourse of sages and worthies. Zhuangzi’s words distinguish thus, yet people claim he divides things into two separate realms of refinement and coarseness. His intent is simply that those who know the Dao are not burdened by external things, possessing the world yet not clinging to it—only then can they fully realize governance through non-action. However, his words are overly emphatic, though his heart is not truly so. "Remnants of threads" and "worthless as dirt" arise only from leftover matters, like dust and chaff. Modern scholars of the *Pan* school have truly taken this as two separate realms, often citing the language of "remnants" and "dirt" in application. Thus, Master Zhu [Xi] vigorously corrected this. The parable of the pearl shooting the sparrow is most apt. Yan He’s heart truly despised wealth and honor, surpassing worldly views by ten thousandfold. Yet it is regrettable that he did not express his sincerity in words, thus failing to convince the envoy, slightly marring his pure virtue. The envoy, having arrived at his home and met the man yet unable to earnestly secure him, accepted his refusal and withdrew—was this not overly simplistic? Difficulty in advancement and ease in retreat are the constant way of the gentleman. The longer the nurturing, the deeper the roots—of Yan He, there is little room for further discussion. Yet the Lord of Lu ardently sought worthies, how rarely does one encounter such a man? Having fortunately met him, to lose him by a turn of the arm, unable to share in great governance and ascend to peace—this truly stemmed from the envoy’s failure to persuade, hence the admonition. Moreover, no worldly achievement surpasses that of emperors and kings, yet even this is deemed a leftover matter. Then what of the true essence of the sage—how could it be fathomed by the common stream? The *so*-of-its-purpose and the *so*-of-its-means are what the *Analects* calls the *whereby* and the *wherein*.

In modern editions, the character *zhe* (者) is often mistakenly added, and *xin* (心) is inserted where *zhi* (治) should be *chi* (持). In "all the sage’s actions," the character *sheng* (圣) is redundant. In "the weight of the Marquis of Sui," *hou* (侯) should be *zhu* (珠). This entire chapter appears in the *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals*, proving that Lü Buwei’s distance from Zhuangzi was not great—he must have grasped the truth.

When Master Liezi was poor, his countenance bore the hue of hunger. A guest spoke of this to Zi Yang of Zheng: "Lie Yukou is a man of the Dao, a vessel of utmost worth. Dwelling in your state yet impoverished—does this not suggest you do not esteem scholars?" Zi Yang of Zheng immediately ordered an official to send him grain. When Master Liezi saw the envoy, he bowed twice and declined. The envoy departed, and Master Liezi entered his home. His wife, gazing at him, struck her breast and said: "I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Dao all enjoy ease and happiness. Now you bear the look of hunger. The lord, passing by, sent you food, yet you refused it—is this not fate?" Master Liezi smiled and said to her: "The lord does not know me himself. He sent me grain on another’s word, and if he were to punish me, it would also be on another’s word. This is why I did not accept it." In the end, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Zi Yang.

**Guo’s Commentary** omits this.
**Lü’s Commentary** does not elaborate further.

**Yidu’s Annotation:** When a scholar is known for his upright conduct, and others seek him out after verifying his true worth, then what they have carefully examined aligns precisely with what is known of him—thus he bears no shame. Zi Yang, as Prime Minister of Zheng, had never met Master Liezi, yet suddenly, on another’s word, he sent him grain. To know him by another’s word is to condemn him by another’s word—this is why he refused it.

**Bixu’s Annotation:** Would a scholar who willingly sinks into obscurity, content with anonymity, ever bend his will to accept undeserved emolument? How could he, swayed by the sentiments of wife and children, hesitate within the snares of disaster?

**Yuanzhai’s Note:** Zi Yang sent grain to Master Liezi on another’s word—he was no true knower of men. If praise could be trusted, so too could slander. As Prime Minister of Zheng, he held the power to weigh the worth of all within the state—could he remain ignorant of a worthy man dwelling in reclusion? To hear of his virtue and send him grain was to meet worth and show respect. Yet Master Liezi thought: if he sends me grain on another’s word, how can I be sure he will not punish me on another’s word? Thus he declined, refusing to accept. This is how the noble man perceives the subtle and knows the manifest, sees the past and foresees the future. His wife, striking her breast, spoke from the vulgar view of the world—who would say the wife and children of a man of the Dao would think thus? The actions of the perfected man are beyond even his wife and children’s full understanding, let alone others. Such words reveal how difficult it is to know a man who wears coarse cloth yet holds jade within. To know him and then govern with the Dao—only then can one fully employ talent and put it to use. As *The Fisherman* says: "Without intimacy, one cannot gain true trust."

King Zhao of Chu lost his state, and the butcher Shuo fled with him. When the king regained his kingdom, he sought to reward those who had followed him, including the butcher Shuo. Shuo said: "When Your Majesty lost the state, I lost my butcher’s trade. Now that Your Majesty has regained the state, I have regained my butcher’s trade. My rank and emolument are restored—what reward is there to give?" The king said: "Compel him to accept." Shuo replied: "When Your Majesty lost the state, it was not my fault, so I dared not submit to punishment. Now that Your Majesty has regained the state, it is not my merit, so I dare not accept reward." The king said: "Let me see him." Shuo said: "By the laws of Chu, only those who have rendered great service through heavy reward may be granted an audience. I know my wisdom is insufficient to preserve the state, and my courage insufficient to die in battle against invaders. When the Wu army entered Ying, I feared disaster and fled the enemy—I did not follow Your Majesty by design. Now, if Your Majesty wishes to set aside the law and break precedent to see me, this is not what I have heard of under heaven." The king said to Marshal Zi Jing: "The butcher Shuo dwells in lowly circumstances yet expounds lofty principles. You shall extend to him the rank of the Three Standards." Shuo said: "The rank of the Three Standards—I know it is nobler than my butcher’s stall. The emolument of ten thousand *zhong*—I know it is richer than my butcher’s profit. Yet how could I covet rank and emolument and cause my lord to bear the name of reckless bestowal? I dare not accept. I wish only to return to my butcher’s stall." Thus he refused.

**Guo’s Annotation:** His righteousness made further explanation unnecessary.

**Yidu’s Annotation:** In the time of Master Zhuang, many people disregarded fate and righteousness, seeking wealth and nobility by chance. Thus he cited the case of the butcher Shuo to admonish them. Though he dwelt in a butcher’s stall, his sense of duty was so steadfast—truly, he could inspire and refine the shallow customs of the age. The Three Standards refer to the rank of the Three Dukes. I know it is wealth and nobility, yet if not obtained by rightful means, I will not take it. Here, in the butcher Shuo, we see this principle. **Bixu’s Annotation:** Those who recite the *Odes* and *Documents* to dispel ignorance, or dwell in butcher’s and wine-seller’s shops yet uphold righteousness—what age has lacked such men? Those who seize power and claim it as their own merit, or trade influence for heavy reward—upon hearing this, should they not feel shame?

**Yuanzhai’s Note:** When the king regained his state, Shuo regained his butcher’s trade—each returned to his proper place. The Three Standards refer to the carriages and robes of the Three Dukes, each distinguished by its own banner. King Zhao rewarded Shuo to demonstrate that in restoring the state, he extended grace. Shuo declined the reward, abiding by righteousness and not overstepping his bounds. When the king lost his state, he could not submit to punishment; when the king regained his state, he dared not accept reward—this was fitting. In an age where many claim reward without merit, one who declines emolument on the grounds of fate is a rare sight. The king commanded an audience to honor his conduct and wish to know the man. Shuo deemed it improper to break precedent for a meeting and thus firmly declined. He would not allow his lord to bear the name of reckless bestowal—his integrity was thus. Such conduct is difficult even for scholar-gentlemen, yet the butcher Shuo performed it with ease. If all the ministers and people of the state were transformed by Shuo’s virtue and emulated him, what worry would there be that the ways of the world would not flourish in mutual ascent?

Yuan Xian lived in Lu in a hut with walls barely enclosing him, thatched with growing grass. The door of woven reeds was incomplete, its hinge made of mulberry wood.

And his two chambers had jars for windows, sealed with coarse cloth; the roof leaked above and the floor was damp below, yet he sat upright and plucked his zither. Zilu rode a grand steed, his robe lined with fine white silk, his carriage too wide for the alley, and came to visit Yuan Xian. Yuan Xian answered the door wearing a hat of birch bark, hempen sandals trailing, and leaning on a staff of wild thorn. Zilu said, "Alas! Master, what ails you?" Yuan Xian replied, "I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty, but to study and fail to practice is called affliction. I am poor, not afflicted." Zilu stepped back, his face flushed with shame. Yuan Xian smiled and said: "To act in pursuit of worldly favor, to befriend for mutual advantage, to study for others’ approval, to teach for personal gain—such are the corruptions of benevolence and righteousness, the trappings of carriages and fine horses. I cannot bring myself to do them."

When Master Zeng lived in Wei, his padded robe had no outer layer, his complexion was swollen and pallid, his hands and feet calloused. For three days he did not light a fire, for ten years he did not make new clothes. When he straightened his cap, its ties snapped; when he grasped his staff, his elbow showed; when he pulled on his shoes, the seams burst. Yet he dragged his hempen robe and sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filling heaven and earth as if ringing from metal and stone. No Son of Heaven could make him a minister, no feudal lord could befriend him. Thus, he who nurtures his will forgets his form; he who nurtures his form forgets profit; he who attains the Way forgets his mind.

Confucius said to Yan Hui, "Hui, come! Your family is poor and your station low—why not enter office?" Yan Hui replied, "I do not wish to." "I have fifty *mu* of fields outside the city walls, enough to provide gruel; ten *mu* within the walls, enough for silk and hemp. Playing the zither amuses me, and what I have learned of your Way is enough to bring me joy. I do not wish to enter office." Confucius’s expression changed, and he said solemnly, "Excellent, Hui’s intent! I have heard that he who knows contentment is not burdened by profit, he who is truly self-possessed is not afraid of loss, and he whose conduct is cultivated within does not chafe at lacking rank. I have recited this for a long time, but only now, in you, do I see it realized. This is my gain."

The above three passages share a single thread of meaning. Guo and Lü did not elaborate on them. Yi Zhu alone commented: Yuan Xian was poor yet without resentment; Master Zeng was poor yet able to console himself; Yan Hui was poor yet took joy in the Way. He who nurtures his will forgets his form—this was Yuan Xian. He who nurtures his form forgets profit—this was Master Zeng. He who attains the Way forgets his mind—this was Yan Hui.

Bi Xu noted: When Zilu served as minister in Wei, he arrived at Yuan Xian’s humble abode with a team of four horses and a retinue of carriages, and sighed at his "affliction." Yuan Xian replied that he was poor, not afflicted, and Zilu was shamed by his own misplaced words. To chase after worldly trends, to seek fame and position, to curry favor and form cliques, to study without self-cultivation, to teach for material gain—these are the corruptions of benevolence and the ostentation of fine carriages. How could one who studies the Way bear to do such things? Yuan Xian studied the Way and practiced it, upholding righteousness without bending. Master Zeng nurtured his will and thus did not seek office; he forgot profit and thus had few companions. He forgot his mind and thus merged with the Way. "He who knows contentment is not disgraced; he who knows when to stop is not endangered." He who is not disgraced has cultivated conduct within; he who is not endangered does not chafe at lacking rank. This is what Confucius recited, and now, in Yan Hui, he saw it embodied.

Juan Zhai remarked: The two chambers both had jars for windows, so he used cloth to block the wind and rain. His hat was made of birch bark. His trailing sandals dragged as he walked. To embellish wickedness with benevolence and righteousness is called *te*. His padded robe was quilted; "no outer layer" means the outer fabric was worn through, revealing the padding. "Swollen and pallid" describes a bloated, unhealthy appearance. The *Odes of Shang* refers to the songs he sang. "As if ringing from metal and stone" describes their rhythmic resonance. He who attains the Way forgets his mind—without mind, he draws near to the Way. To study the Way is enough to bring joy; the Cheng brothers often taught others to seek Yan Hui’s joy, not to pass over it lightly. "I have recited this for a long time" means he had heard the words before but now saw them in a person. Yuan Xian, though living in a wattle hut with a thatched door, sat plucking his zither as if in a grand hall, for benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music never left him. Zilu, though honored as a minister, was a withered branch in a time of decaying virtue; that he deigned to visit showed he had not forgotten their friendship. Yet to ask, "What ails you?" revealed how little he understood. Though he had studied under a sage, his perception was thus. Yuan Xian carefully distinguished poverty from affliction to enlighten him. From "to act in pursuit of worldly favor" to "the trappings of carriages and fine horses" describes the great affliction of scholars—Zilu, though steeped in luxury, did not recognize his own malady. Only Yuan Xian’s sharp admonition served as a true friend’s reproof. Master Zeng’s swollen complexion, calloused hands and feet, snapped cap ties, exposed elbows, and burst shoes revealed his poverty. Yet nurturing his will, he forgot his form; singing as if from metal and stone, his vast integrity filled heaven and earth. Even a ruler of ten thousand chariots could not befriend him, much less make him a minister. Yan Hui, content with poverty and joyful in the Way, did not chafe at lacking rank. Following the Master’s steps and grasping his heart, he did nothing, yet found joy in a gourd dipper—how could those who wear crimson sashes and hold golden seals compare? These three were all Confucius’s finest disciples, who received the Sage’s teachings directly. Their attainments differed in refinement, so their joys differed in depth. Zilu, who roamed the states as an envoy, held high office, and amassed wealth to dazzle the world, found joy far removed from the other two. Thus Zhuangzi cited them as a warning.

The Lord of Zhongshan, Gongzi Mou, said to Zhanzi, "My body dwells by rivers and seas, yet my heart lingers at the palace gates—what is to be done?" Zhanzi replied, "Value life. If you value life, profit will seem light." The Lord of Zhongshan said, "Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself." Zhanzi said, "If you cannot overcome yourself, then yield. What harm is there in that? But if you cannot overcome yourself and yet force yourself not to yield, this is called double injury."

The doubly injured man belongs to no long-lived kind. Wei Mou, a prince of a ten-thousand-chariot state, found it harder to dwell in caves and grottoes than a commoner would; though he had not yet attained the Way, he may be said to have grasped its intent. Guo and Lü passed over him without discussion.

Dubious Annotation: Prince Mou of Wei was enfeoffed at Zhongshan. Zhanzi was a worthy man of Wei. The prince’s noble heart was most difficult to overcome, so though his body dwelt by rivers and seas, his heart lingered at the palace gates. He confessed his inability to forget wealth and honor—how could he let them go? The answer came: value life, and profit will seem light; when profit is light, thoughts of the palace gates will fade. Though Mou knew life should be valued and things made light, his heart could not overcome itself, and thus he harbored private attachments. Zhanzi told him: if you cannot overcome your attachments, then yield—will the spirit find fault in that? The spirit is born of emptiness, but Mou’s heart was not yet empty, so he could not overcome himself. To force himself not to yield was to bruise his passions and doubly injure his nature, placing him among those without longevity.

To say that Mou, a prince of a ten-thousand-chariot state, could suddenly retire to caves and grottoes and live as a commoner would be truly difficult; yet having grasped the intent, he might yet be expected to attain it. The *Bixu Annotation* states: Though Prince Mou had once savored the blandness of the Way, he could not overcome the allure of sweet bait. To follow his inclinations is to nourish life; to resist the spirit is to invite harm. Having lost the joy of nurturing form and added the sorrow of resisting the spirit, what is this if not double injury?

Wei Mou admired the fame of noble reclusion but fell short of its substance. His intent was easily aroused, his resolve hard to maintain; yet compared to those who blindly chase wealth and honor, he was surely a step ahead. *Yuanzhai* says: Know that my life may be valued, and external things will grow light. If principle cannot yet prevail, then yield for now and do not force restraint. Forced restraint harms the spirit, and the spirit abhors it. This is no way to nurture oneself—it excludes one from the long-lived kind. He may be said to have grasped the intent and to be striving to practice it.

The *xiangwei* and *guanque* were the gates of a lord’s palace. The *Huainanzi* writes it as *chouque*, with the same pronunciation and gloss. Xu Shen’s annotation: the two watchtowers of the Son of Heaven.

“Cannot overcome oneself, then yield” means to follow one’s nature and passions without forced restraint. Some connect it to the spirit, meaning to follow where the heart-spirit inclines. Yet those who study the Way should diminish passions and eliminate desires, aspiring to purity and emptiness. To say instead that one should follow one’s nature and passions, allowing the spirit to harmonize and the mind to flow freely, is to find no fault in failing to overcome oneself. And to say that forced restraint without yielding is double injury is to advocate indulging passions and pleasures as the Way, akin to what *Liezi* records of Guan Yifu’s teaching: the Way of nurturing life is to give free rein and not restrain.

Tracing the original intent: Prince Mou was born into wealth and honor, so to retire to caves and grottoes was truly difficult. If he over-restrained his passions, he risked injuring his nature, so he was gently guided to advance step by step—this, too, is a path to success. Zhuangzi took this as an exhortation to those of wealth and honor who study the Way, that they might not turn back at the precipice. Guan Yifu, by contrast, made strengthening the state and its armies his concern, so his teachings were partial and incomparable to Mou’s.

Zhanzi’s words cannot serve as a model for those who study the Way—like a skilled physician treating illness, he tailored his prescription to the patient, aiming only to cure. *The Ocean of Meanings in the True Classic of Zhuangzi*, Scroll Ninety-Three, ends here. *The Ocean of Meanings in the True Classic of Zhuangzi*, Scroll Ninety-Four.

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin on *"Yielding the Throne"* (Second Chapter)

When Confucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, he went seven days without cooked food, his vegetable broth ungrained, his complexion utterly spent—yet he still plucked the zither and sang within his chamber. Yan Hui picked wild greens, while Zilu and Zigong conferred, saying: "The Master was twice exiled from Lu, his name erased in Wei, his tree felled in Song, impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai. Whoever slays him incurs no guilt; whoever tramples him faces no prohibition. Yet he never ceases his zither and song—can a noble man be so shameless?"

Yan Hui had no reply. He entered and told Confucius, who pushed aside his zither and sighed deeply: "You and Ci are petty men. Summon them—I shall speak to them." Zilu and Zigong entered. Zilu said: "This can truly be called destitution!" Confucius replied: "What words are these! The noble man who attains the Dao is called *attained*; one who is cut off from the Dao is called *destitute*. Now I embrace the Dao of benevolence and righteousness, yet suffer the calamities of a disordered age—how can this be called destitution? Thus, when I look within and am not cut off from the Dao, when I face peril and do not lose my virtue, when the cold arrives and frost and snow descend, I know the flourishing of the pine and cypress. The straits of Chen and Cai—are they not a blessing for me?"

Confucius then calmly returned to his zither and strummed, while Zilu, elated, took up his shield and danced. Zigong said: "I did not know the height of Heaven or the depth of Earth. The ancients who attained the Dao found joy in destitution and joy in success—what they rejoiced in was not destitution or success, but the presence of virtue and power. Then destitution and success became as regular as the cycles of cold and heat, wind and rain. Thus Xu You delighted in Yingyang, and Gong Bo found contentment on Mount Qiu."

Guo Xiang’s commentary omits this. Lü’s annotation: From Yan He and Yu Kou to Confucius, none recklessly accepted the titles, emoluments, or gifts of others, enduring poverty, lowliness, cold, and hunger without altering their joy. Next was Prince Mou, who, though not yet attaining the Dao, possessed its intent. Worldly men, steeped in human artifice, hear of the ways of Xu You and Shan Juan and dismiss them as madness, refusing belief. Thus, none among the sages and worthies failed to delight in the Dao, forgetting their lives. If even forgetting life—so difficult—was undertaken, then surely not harming one’s life for the sake of the world or the state was easily understood.

Yi Zhu’s commentary: The Master’s Dao filled the space between Heaven and Earth. How could success or failure burden him? When he was trapped in Chen and Cai, cut off from all above and below, going seven days without cooked food, the Master did not take it as cause for sorrow but continued his zither and song. At that time, only Yan Hui truly understood him. Zilu and Zigong could not escape the charge of shamelessness, so he summoned the two and spoke of success and failure lying in the Dao, not in external things. "Now I embrace the Dao of benevolence and righteousness—how can this be called destitution?" This was facing peril without losing his virtue. Virtue and power reside within; without peril, they cannot be seen—just as only in bitter cold does one know the pine and cypress. Thus the Master considered it a blessing. He then returned to his zither and strummed, and the two disciples, enlightened, took up shields and danced. "I did not know the height of Heaven or the depth of Earth" expresses the ineffable vastness of the Master’s Dao. From this, one knows that the ancients who attained the Dao found joy in both success and failure, for what they rejoiced in was not success or failure.

Bi Xu’s commentary: "This can truly be called destitution" shows that they judged progress by success or failure in time, not knowing the root of the Dao. The pine and cypress flourish when frost and snow arrive; the sage remains unshaken amid peril. Using the examples of Duke Huan, Duke Wen, and the King of Yue to illuminate the straits of Chen and Cai, the truth is that the Dao is made manifest through events. "The height of Heaven and the depth of Earth" alludes to the greatness of Confucius’ Dao. Virtue and power are like metal and stone—once tuned, they cannot be altered. Success and failure are like the zither and lute—when a melody ends, the tuning changes. Thus, success and failure lie with man, like wind and rain, cold and heat—constant principles of Heaven. Xu You declined Yao’s throne and withered in Yingyang; Gong Bo declined office and found his will on Mount Qiu; Confucius, undaunted by the straits of Cai and Chen, stood firm between the two states.

Juan Zhai’s notes: *Bu san* means "without grains of rice." *Jie* means "to trample and humiliate." "The cold arrives, the pine and cypress flourish" refers to their late-withering nature. Through the straits of Chen and Cai, the sage’s unyielding integrity in destitution was revealed, serving as a model for later generations—hence it is called a blessing. *Xiaoran* suggests the sound of a carefree, unburdened manner. *Heran* describes a joyful, leaping appearance. Zigong’s words express his sudden awakening. "Shang and Zhou" refer to the Zhou capital, which included the old lands and people of Shang. What Zilu and Zigong spoke of were the Master’s outward circumstances; Yanzi understood the Master’s heart, thus transcending words. When success and failure lie in the Dao, worldly gains and losses cannot add or detract. Not being cut off from the Dao means not losing one’s virtue—then what peril could sway him? Only in bitter cold does one know the pine and cypress; only in peril is the sage revealed—this is why it is called a blessing. The Master returned to his zither and song, at peace with fate and unshaken in his joy. Zilu took up his shield and danced with fervor, awakened to the principle and heartened, unaware of his own exuberant movements. Zigong’s words praise the boundless greatness of the Master’s Dao. "Virtue and power" here should be understood as "attainment," as seen in the preceding text. Xu You and Gong Bo delighted in their own joy because they had attained this Dao. Mount Qiu is a mountain name.

Bi Xu’s *Southern Ancient Manuscript* reads: "The flourishing of the pine and cypress" is followed by three examples: Duke Huan attained it, Duke Wen of Ju attained it, and the Kings of Wu and Yue attained it at Kuaiji. Hence his commentary. The character *zhi* ("will") appears after "Gong Bo attained," and "impoverished in Shang and Zhou"—the character *Shang* is problematic, and various interpretations omit it without discussion. Only Yongzhai addresses it.

Shun offered the world to his friend Beiren Wuze, who said: "How strange is the Lord’s conduct! Dwelling in the furrows and fields, he should have been content with this alone—yet now he seeks to smear me with his disgraceful deeds. I am ashamed to see him." Thereupon he cast himself into the Qingling Abyss.

When Tang was about to attack Jie, he consulted Bian Sui, who said: "This is not my affair." Tang asked: "Who, then, is suitable?" Bian Sui replied: "I do not know." Tang then consulted Wu Guang, who said: "This is not my affair." Tang asked: "Who, then, is suitable?" Wu Guang replied: "I do not know." Tang said: "What of Yi Yin?" Wu Guang answered: "He is strong and enduring of disgrace—I know nothing beyond this." Tang then plotted with Yi Yin to attack Jie, defeated him, and offered the world to Bian Sui. Bian Sui declined, saying: "When the Lord plotted against Jie, he consulted me—he must have taken me for a villain. Now that he has defeated Jie and offers me the world, he must take me for a greedy man. I was born in a chaotic age, and a man without the Way has twice come to smear me with disgraceful deeds. I cannot bear to hear such things again." He then cast himself into the Chou River and died.

Tang next offered the world to Wu Guang, saying: "The wise plan it, the martial execute it, and the benevolent dwell in it—this is the Way of antiquity. Why do you not take your place?" Wu Guang declined, saying: "To depose a ruler is not righteous; to kill the people is not benevolent; to let others face danger while I enjoy the profit is not upright. I have heard that one does not accept emoluments from unrighteousness, nor tread the soil of a world without the Way—how much less accept its honors? I cannot bear to see this any longer." He then carried a stone and drowned himself in the Lu River.

Guo’s commentary: "A scholar may kill himself to fulfill benevolence, but he does not seek life at the cost of benevolence. Their aspirations were lofty and remote, their noble winds transcended the world—compared to those who drown themselves in profit and power, they were as different as heaven and earth. The old saying claims that men like Bian Sui and Wu Guang regarded the world as beyond the six directions, beyond what others could comprehend. This is mistaken. Those who treat the world lightly cannot hold anything in esteem; if they hold nothing in esteem, they have no cause for death. To regard the world as beyond the six directions is fitting only for Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang. Detached and unentangled, drifting with the multitude, indifferent to gain or loss—why would they cast themselves away? These two men may be admired for their devotion to fame and their longing for loftiness, but they cannot be said to have placed the world outside themselves."

Lu’s commentary appears in a later chapter.

Yi Du’s commentary: "Shun and Tang followed the same Way. Shun obtained it by compliance, Tang by opposition. Compliance follows heaven to reach man; opposition reverses the Way to enter virtue. Shun’s offer to Beiren Wuze reveals the depth of his return to the mandate. Tang’s conquest of the world and his offers to Bian Sui and Wu Guang show that he had no personal desire for the world—the reason for his attack was for the people, not for himself. The matter of Yi Yin assisting Tang in attacking Jie is fully recorded in the *Book*, but Tang’s offer of the world has never been attested. Zhuangzi created this account to convey the idea of abdication."

Bi Xu’s commentary: "Men of purity regard honor as disgrace. Beiren Wuze, for instance, could stand alongside Zhong Wu as an equal or befriend Ziling without his resolve being shaken by external things. As for Bian Sui and Wu Guang, they refused to serve a chaotic age and fled—why go so far as to drown themselves? Their actions were a rebuke to later generations."

Juanzhai’s commentary: "Shun’s offer to his friend has no other attestation—it is also a parable. *Strong and enduring* means capable of action; *enduring of disgrace* means tolerating defilement. Bian Sui and Wu Guang were ancient recluses; their circumstances cannot be verified. Shun and Wuze were friends, and Shun must have known he was capable of bearing the responsibility, hence his offer of the world. When Wuze refused, Shun should have either abandoned the idea or fled—why cast himself into the Qingling Abyss? The text implies that Shun’s dwelling in the furrows and his visits to Yao’s court were disgraceful—thus his resolve is evident. How could Shun not understand the aspirations of one so far beneath him?

Tang, in his eagerness to attack Jie, was a man of action, while Bian Sui and Wu Guang were men of non-action. For Tang to consult them was like heading north when intending to go south. Only after obtaining Yi Yin did he succeed in defeating Jie. Upon returning, he offered the world to Bian Sui, who not only refused but, ashamed of being defiled, cast himself into the Chou River. When Tang offered it to Wu Guang, Wu Guang enumerated his violations of righteousness, benevolence, and integrity, ultimately refusing his emoluments, refusing to tread his soil, and drowning himself with a stone. These three men were all of lofty integrity, unyielding and steadfast. Since ancient times, death has been no cause for regret—thus the *Nanhua* presents their example to rouse a degenerate age.

Upon reflection, the meaning of this chapter is this: though Shun’s abdication is not recorded elsewhere, his virtue in yielding and being yielded to is perfect and flawless, beyond reproach. As for Tang’s abdication, it may not have been his true intention, and he could not escape the world’s censure. The accounts of Bian Sui and Wu Guang drowning in the Chou and Lu Rivers may represent the extreme of their avoidance—it is best to leave them unexamined.

In the rise of the Zhou, there were two scholars in Guzhu named Boyi and Shuqi. They said to each other: 'We have heard there is a man in the west who seems to possess the Way—let us go and observe him.' When they reached Qiyang, King Wu heard of them and sent Shu Dan to meet them. He made an alliance, saying: 'I will grant you wealth two ranks above others and an official position of the first order.' He slaughtered an animal and buried it in the earth as a pledge. The two men looked at each other and laughed: 'Ah! How strange!'"

"This is not what I call the Way. In ancient times, when Shennong ruled the world, his seasonal sacrifices were performed with utmost reverence yet without prayers for blessings. In his dealings with others, he was wholly loyal and trustworthy, governing without seeking anything in return. He delighted in sharing governance with others, taking joy in their governance as his own. He did not complete himself through others’ failures, nor exalt himself through others’ lowliness, nor profit from the times he encountered. Now, the Zhou, seeing the disorder of the Yin, hastily seized power. They schemed above and bribed below, relied on military force to maintain authority, slaughtered animals and buried them to seal oaths as pledges of trust, paraded their conduct to please the masses, and resorted to killing and warfare to seize advantage—this is merely replacing one chaos with another.

I have heard that the scholars of old, when encountering an orderly age, did not shirk their duties, and when facing a disordered age, did not seek mere survival. Now, the world is in turmoil, and the virtue of the Zhou has declined. To align myself with the Zhou would only sully my conduct—it is better to avoid them and keep my actions pure." The two men journeyed north to Mount Shouyang and starved to death.

As for Boyi and Shuqi, when it came to wealth and rank, if they could be avoided, they would not rely on them. With lofty integrity and unyielding conduct, they took solitary joy in their aspirations, refusing to serve the world—such was the resolve of these two scholars.

Guo’s commentary: *The Analects* states that Boyi and Shuqi starved on Mount Shouyang without mentioning their deaths. Here, it speaks of their death to clarify that they upheld the Way to the end.

Lü’s commentary: Those like Wuze, Bian Sui, Wu Guang, Boyi, and Shuqi not only refused the world and its ranks and emoluments but also regarded hearing its words or living in its age as defilement. They chose drowning or starvation rather than compromise, making their joy in the Way and disregard for life all the more difficult—something the sentiments of the common world cannot fathom. These men were all sages and worthies, thus they were certainly enlightened regarding the meaning of life and death.

Some deaths are weightier than Mount Tai, others lighter than a goose feather. The abdications of Shun and Yu, in their later developments, led to the usurpations of Qi of Xia and Tang of Yin, and the deeds of King Wu of Zhou—these were but accumulated consequences. Yet to have heard the example of Wuze, Bian Sui, Wu Guang, Boyi, and Shuqi—how could this not be of great benefit to later ages and the world to come? Thus, death was not what they cherished.

Yet Han Fei claimed that Tang, fearing the world would deem him covetous, offered the throne to Wu Guang, and when he feared Guang would accept, sent someone to persuade him. Tang wished to shift the odium onto his son, whereupon Guang drowned himself in a river. Sima Qian likewise did not believe in the existence of Bian Sui and Wu Guang. Han Fei, who understood the necessity of sacrificing oneself, thus measured Tang and Guang by such standards.

Now, Xu You, Zhi Fu, and Zhi Bo would not exchange their lives for the world, inspiring later ages to value life and disdain profit. Wuze, Bian Sui, Wu Guang, Boyi, and Shuqi, however, abandoned life to sharpen the world’s resolve, inspiring later ages to forget life and esteem righteousness. In their benevolence, they were one and the same.

When Zhuangzi discussed the supreme Way, dismissing fame and profit, Boyi, Shuqi, Bian Sui, and Wu Guang were all criticized. Yet when he spoke of abdicating the throne, awakening the world to the folly of endangering oneself for external things, they were all esteemed. Those who understand this will grasp the meaning without needing words.

Yi Zhu’s commentary: Confucius and Mencius praised Boyi and Shuqi as sages, securing their reputation for posterity. What Zhuangzi recorded were the words of historians, his intent being to correct the world’s folly in sacrificing itself for external things—thus his words could not be without excess. The original purpose of this chapter was to inspire lofty and reclusive conduct, emboldening the timid and rousing the indolent, yet it was not without its flaws. The flaw of Boyi and Shuqi was that it allowed tyrannical rulers to vent their cruelty without anyone daring to resist.

For when one does not encounter the right time, regulating one’s conduct to correct the world may also produce such consequences. But if one acts in accord with the times and follows the natural course of things, then one leaves no trace and incurs no harm.

Bixu’s commentary: In an age of pristine simplicity, sacrifices to the gods were made without seeking blessings, and serving a lord was done without demanding emolument. One governed when called to govern, and administered when called to administer—following the desires of others. The rivers and seas become the kings of all valleys by virtue of their lowliness. Now, to complete oneself, exalt oneself, and seek profit for oneself—this is what the sage does not endorse.

In carrying on King Wen’s legacy, Boyi and Shuqi abandoned Guzhu to seek the one with the Way—how could they have been men who coveted rank and emolument? Gathering ferns on Western Mountain and nurturing their aspirations in the secluded forest—was this not their innate purity?

Yuanzhai’s notes: "Praying for blessings" means seeking fortune. "Without seeking" means without fame. "Sharing governance" means acting without self-interest. "Hastily" means hurriedly. "Bribing" refers to using emoluments to attract the world’s scholars. "Relying on military force" means resorting to perilous means.

To preserve power is to establish martial strength. To display conduct is to make one’s name illustrious. To align with the Zhou means to say, “I and the Zhou share this world”—yet this is the path to defilement. Not relying on it as a resource means the two men did not seek to exalt their integrity or harden their conduct into obstinacy. Had there been a principle by which wealth and rank could be accepted, they would have accepted them; only when it was contrary to righteousness did they act as they did.

When the world united, the Shang fell into chaos. The virtue of the Zhou declined—though the Zhou was then rising, their conduct was already thus, detestable for seizing the world through cunning and strategy. Boyi and Shuqi abandoned their lord’s throne to observe at Qiyang, admiring the transformative power of Zhou’s virtue, wishing to become the people of a sage and together delight in the transformation of non-action. King Wu sent Shu Dan to make a covenant with them and entice them with rank and emolument—how could this have been the aspiration of the two men! Thus, they invoked the age of Shennong to prove the error of the present: in those times, sacrifices did not seek blessings; the seasonal rites at the altar and the harvest festival were performed with utmost reverence to repay the spirits, without any covetous expectations. From this, the governance of the state through non-action can be known. To share in governance is to govern without self-interest; to share in order is to govern without causing disturbance. One does not destroy others to complete oneself, nor belittle others to exalt oneself, nor exploit the times for personal gain. Thus, one regards others as oneself, and all things attain their proper balance.

Now, seeing the disorder of the Yin, the Zhou hastened to cultivate governance, seizing the opportunity of their peril to plot against them. They used emoluments to attract the world’s scholars, preserved power, pleased the masses, and sought profit—no different from replacing one chaos with another. When the times unite and virtue declines, and one rises alongside such an age, fearing the defilement of one’s person, it is better to avoid it. Thus, they went north to Shouyang and willingly starved to death. Starvation is a calamity of the body; the loss of integrity is the cessation of the heart. If the calamity of the heart is extended, it leads to defying punishments and sacrificing righteousness, spreading poison without end. The calamity of the body ends with oneself, yet it is sufficient to stem the tide of decline and revive moral transformation. Thus, the people praise them to this day, and Confucius affirmed their benevolence. The two men sought benevolence and attained it, harboring no resentment.

Now, the world is united, and the virtue of the Zhou has declined. Chen Bixu’s *Ancient Text from the South of the Jiang* reads “the virtue of the Yin declined,” for it was the decline of Yin’s virtue that led the Zhou to destroy them. Master Guo said: The original intent of this chapter is to inspire a spirit of lofty retreat. Those touched by this spirit, even if they are men of reckless ambition who ride the celestial thoroughfare to enter the purple court, will still sigh with emotion midway. How much more so for ordinary men! Thus, the followers of Boyi and Xu You are worthy to stand alongside Hou Ji and Xie, or to face Yi Yin and Lü Shang. Those who dwell in mountains and valleys yet magnify the world—though they may not all become sages’ assistants, are they not still loftier than those mired in dust and grime? Their deeds may be difficult to emulate, yet their influence is less prone to corruption, and thus they are to be esteemed.

Where lies the flaw in Boyi and Xu You? The flaw of Xu You is that it leads people to feign modesty in order to advance, even to the point of choking on water. The flaw of Boyi is that it allows tyrannical rulers to unleash their poison without anyone daring to resist. The flaw of Yi Yin and Lü Shang is that it emboldens reckless heroes of the world to dare to usurp and rebel. Only the sage leaves no trace, and thus has no flaw. If Yi Yin and Lü Shang are considered the traces of the sage, then Boyi and Shuqi are also the sage’s legacy. If Boyi and Shuqi are not the sage’s legacy, then the deeds of Yi Yin and King Wu are also not sagely. The sage follows the natural course of things, thus leaving no trace. Therefore, what is called sagely is that I originally have no advancement, so things attain their traces. Once traces are attained and the name “sage” is forcibly applied, then the sage is but the name of having no trace.

Lu Deming said: Some claim that *Yielding the Throne* places great emphasis on preserving life. Yet why did Bian Sui and Wu Guang throw themselves into the water? The rise of Zhuangzi lies in returning to the root; returning to the root begins with relinquishing glory. Thus, he clarifies the lofty spirit of yielding the throne and sets forth the untrammeled aspirations of defying the world: not descending to sharpen the customs, not enriching oneself to seek life. Though there are words about valuing life, they ultimately return to the intent of abandoning glory, thereby deeply exposing the flaws of worldly affairs. Those of a lesser rank—men who wear coarse cloth and sip congee—preserve the Dao in their loftiness, transcend the world in their freedom, and would rather cast themselves into the clear and cold waters than bow to the burdens of the world.

Liu Gai said: In matters of necessity, there is nothing one does not reject; in matters where one could refrain yet does not, there is nothing one does not take. Rejecting all is akin to restraint; taking all is akin to recklessness. The sage attains the middle way and engages with them, thus both are to be discarded. If one does not attain the middle way and engages with them, then both fall within the realm of judgment. Recklessness and restraint are indeed the flaws of the middle way. Yet later generations of reckless men do not merely advance—they even covet life, love profit, and plunge into the abyss of desire. Those of restraint do not merely refrain from certain acts—they even wash their ears and throw themselves into the abyss to detest the names of Yao and Shun. This is the flaw of recklessness and restraint. Zhuangzi speaks of yielding as a name, situated between giving and receiving, where one should not lose the proper measure. The king is the greatest in the realm; if one can yield the throne, what matter is there that cannot be yielded? Thus, the sage, out of necessity, governs the world, as seen in the case of Wangzi Sou. When the sage is utterly without external things, who would trouble themselves with the world’s affairs? When one is utterly without self within, the world naturally turns to them—how could they refuse? In this way, Yao and Shun’s abdication, Tang and Wu’s conquest, Yi Yin’s service to Tang, and Boyi’s avoidance of Zhou—whether treading the gates of Yao or dwelling in the fields—all share the same principle.

Chu Shi’s general discussion: This chapter records the lofty integrity of those who yielded the throne, from Yao, Shun, Xu You, and Shan Juan to Wangzi Sou. All valued the Dao and honored life, not allowing wealth and rank to burden their hearts, viewing the world as a worn-out shoe.

The disciples Zihua, Yan He, Zeng, Yan, and Gongzi Mou—these men preserved their true nature and upheld simplicity, never allowing profit or rank to sway their resolve, regarding wealth and honor as drifting clouds. Among them, Wei Mou compared himself to the sages and worthies and found himself lacking, yet as a prince of the state, to relinquish the exalted position of kingship and retreat into the seclusion of mountain caves was truly no easy feat. Thus, the far-reaching influence of his noble example awakened in those who held states and thrones the reverence for the Dao and the honoring of life. The teachings of purity and non-action were thereby established, and the legacy of the mysterious sage and the unadorned king was thereby made manifest.

Those in the world who forget themselves and sacrifice to external things, when faced with even the slightest gain or loss, will contend over the merest trifle. Yet to yield the throne while still in possession of it—this may be called the greatest deed under heaven! Those who embrace the Dao and hold fast to virtue, becoming the refuge of others, may not desire a state and instead withdraw into the mountains and seas—such cases exist. Why then did men like Wu Ze and Sui Guang hastily drown themselves, losing their irreplaceable lives? It is because scholars who cannot follow the middle way and instead stand rigidly apart cannot avoid excess. Those who demand too much of themselves pursue their aims without satisfaction, inevitably leading to usurpation; those who yield too much flee without refuge, inevitably leading to self-destruction. This not only demonstrates their refusal to accept but also reveals the extremity of their refusal, exposing it to later generations—an excess of admiration for fame.

Only the sage embodies the mean without excess, yielding or accepting as is fitting, withdrawing or appearing as circumstances allow, moving with ease along the middle way—such were the deeds of Yao and Shun. Boyi and Shuqi yielded their state and fled to Mount Shouyang, where they ate ferns and ultimately perished. They were not like those who deliberately feign loftiness to win fame in later ages; rather, the world had declined in virtue and could not tolerate their coexistence. Their aspiration was to transcend the mundane and rise above, preserving the Dao alone—even death was of no concern! As for those who yield while already rulers, their deeds are conspicuous. Those who avoid rule before ascending the throne—this is their withdrawal and concealment. The resolve to retreat and yield is fundamentally the same; only the timing differs.

*The Ninety-Fourth Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei *is complete.*
*The Ninety-Fifth Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei *begins.*

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin studied the *First Chapter on Robber Zhi*.

Confucius was a friend of Liuxia Ji, whose younger brother was Robber Zhi. Leading a band of nine thousand followers, Zhi rampaged across the world, plundering the feudal lords, breaking into homes and prying open doors, driving off people’s cattle and horses, seizing their wives and daughters. Greedy and heedless of kinship, he disregarded parents and brothers, offering no sacrifices to his ancestors. Wherever he passed, great states fortified their cities, small states took refuge in their strongholds, and the common people suffered grievously.

Confucius said to Liuxia Ji: “As a father, one must instruct one’s son; as an elder brother, one must teach one’s younger brother. If a father cannot instruct his son, or an elder brother cannot teach his younger brother, then the bond of father and son, elder and younger brother, is worthless. Now, sir, you are a man of talent in this age, yet your brother is Robber Zhi, a scourge to the world, and you cannot teach him. I am secretly ashamed for you. Allow me to go and persuade him on your behalf.”

Liuxia Ji replied: “You say that as a father one must instruct one’s son, and as an elder brother one must teach one’s younger brother. But if a son does not heed his father’s commands, or a younger brother does not accept his elder brother’s teachings, what can even your eloquence accomplish? Moreover, Zhi’s nature is such that his mind surges like a spring, his intentions gust like the wind. His strength suffices to repel enemies, his eloquence suffices to gloss over wrongs. He is pleased when his heart is followed, enraged when it is opposed, and easily provoked by words. You must not go.”

Confucius would not listen. Yan Hui drove the carriage, and Zigong stood to the right as they went to see Robber Zhi. Zhi was then resting his troops on the southern slope of Mount Tai, mincing human livers to spread upon his mat. Confucius descended from the carriage and stepped forward. Addressing the herald, he said: “I, Kong Qiu of Lu, have heard of the general’s lofty virtue and respectfully bow twice to the herald.” The herald went in to announce him.

When Robber Zhi heard this, he flew into a great rage. His eyes blazed like stars, and his hair bristled beneath his cap. He said: “Is this not that cunning and deceitful man Kong Qiu of Lu? Tell him this: You fabricate words and concoct phrases, falsely invoking Kings Wen and Wu. You wear a cap of branching wood and gird yourself with the flanks of dead oxen. With your glib tongue and deceptive speech, you eat without plowing, clothe yourself without weaving, and flap your lips to stir up right and wrong, deluding the rulers of the world and leading the scholars of the age to abandon their roots. You falsely preach filial piety and brotherly respect, all to seek the luck of enfeoffment and wealth. Your crimes are grave indeed! Flee at once, or I shall add your liver to today’s feast!”

Confucius sent word again: “I, Qiu, am fortunate to be known to Ji and wish to gaze upon the hem of your robe.” The herald relayed this message, and Robber Zhi said: “Let him come forward.” Confucius hastened forward. Robber Zhi, hand on sword and eyes glaring, roared like a nursing tiger: “Come closer, Qiu! If your words please me, you shall live; if they oppose me, you shall die.”

Confucius said: “I have heard that there are three virtues in the world. To be born and grow tall, surpassingly handsome, so that all who see you—young and old, noble and base—are delighted: this is the highest virtue. To comprehend the workings of heaven and earth, to distinguish all things: this is the middle virtue. To be brave, resolute, and daring, to gather followers and lead troops: this is the lowest virtue. Anyone possessing even one of these virtues is fit to face south and style himself a lord. Now, General, you possess all three. Your body stands eight feet and two inches tall, your face and eyes radiant, your lips like bright cinnabar, your teeth like aligned shells, your voice attuned to the *Huangzhong* pitch. Yet you are called Robber Zhi. I am secretly ashamed for you—why not take a nobler name?

If you are willing to heed me, I shall go south to Wu and Yue, north to Qi and Lu, east to Song and Wei, and west to Jin and Chu, to have a great city of several hundred *li* built for you, with a settlement of hundreds of thousands of households. I shall honor you as a feudal lord, renewing the world with you, disbanding your troops and resting your soldiers, gathering and nurturing your brothers, and together offering sacrifices to your ancestors. This is the conduct of a sage and a man of talent, and the wish of all under heaven.”

Robber Zhi said: “Those who can be swayed by profit or admonished by words are but the foolish and base common folk. As for being tall and handsome, so that all who see you are delighted—this is the legacy of my parents. Even if you do not praise me, do I not know it myself? Moreover, I have heard that those who flatter to one’s face also slander behind one’s back. Now you offer me a great city and a multitude of people, seeking to lure me with profit and treat me like the common herd. How can this last? Of all great cities, none is greater than the world itself. Yao and Shun possessed the world, yet their descendants had not even a place to plant an awl! Tang and Wu became Sons of Heaven, yet their lines were later extinguished! Was this not because the profit was too great?

Furthermore, I have heard that in ancient times, beasts were many and people few. The people all dwelt in nests to avoid them, gathering acorns by day and perching in trees by night. They were called the people of the Nest-Builder. In ancient times, people did not know clothing. In summer, they piled up firewood; in winter, they burned it to warm themselves. They were called the people who knew how to live. In the age of Shennong, they lay at ease and rose carefree. People knew their mothers but not their fathers, and lived among the deer. They plowed to eat and wove to clothe themselves, harboring no thought of harming one another. This was the height of perfect virtue. Yet even the Yellow Emperor could not sustain this virtue. He fought Chiyou on the fields of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao and Shun arose and established a host of ministers. Tang exiled his lord, and King Wu attacked Zhou. From then on, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many bullied the few. From Tang and Wu onward, all have been men of disorder.

Now you cultivate the Way of Wen and Wu, wielding the world’s eloquence to instruct later ages. You wear fine robes with narrow sashes, uttering artful words and feigning conduct to delude the rulers of the world, all to seek wealth and honor. There is no greater robber than you!”

"Why does the world not call you 'Robber Qiu' and instead call me 'Robber Zhi'? You beguiled Zilu with honeyed words, making him remove his warrior’s cap, lay aside his long sword, and accept your teachings. The world all says, 'Confucius can quell violence and forbid wrongdoing.' Yet in the end, Zilu sought to kill the lord of Wei, and the affair failed—his corpse hung upon the eastern gate of Wei. This proves your teaching was insufficient.

"Do you claim to be a man of talent, a sage? Yet you were twice driven from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged in Chen and Cai, and found no refuge under heaven. Above, you could not secure your own person; below, you could not fulfill the Way of a son. Is this truly worthy of esteem?

"The one the world exalts above all is the Yellow Emperor. Yet even he could not preserve perfect virtue, fighting on the fields of Zhuolu until blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao was unfilial, Shun was undutiful, Yu was crippled by partiality, Tang exiled his lord, King Wu attacked Zhou, and King Wen was imprisoned at Youli. These six men are those the world reveres. Yet if one examines them closely, all were deluded by profit, violently distorting their true nature. Their conduct is deeply shameful!

"The world’s so-called worthy men—Bo Yi, Shu Qi, who renounced the lord of Guzhu and starved to death on Mount Shouyang, their flesh left unburied; Bao Jiao, who adorned his conduct to condemn the age, embracing a tree in death; Shentu Di, who remonstrated in vain, carried a stone into the river, and was devoured by fish and turtles; Jie Zitui, the paragon of loyalty, who cut flesh from his thigh to feed Duke Wen, only to be betrayed—enraged, he departed and burned to death in the forest. Weisheng, who arranged to meet a woman beneath a bridge, and when she did not come, the waters rose, yet he would not leave, holding fast to the pillar until he drowned. These six men, so zealous in their conduct, differ not from stray dogs, wandering swine, or beggars clutching gourds. All pursued fame and scorned death, heedless of nurturing their lives and preserving their destinies.

"The world’s so-called loyal ministers—none surpass Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu. Zixu was drowned in the river, Bigan had his heart carved out. These two are called loyal ministers, yet in the end, they became the world’s laughingstock. From the highest perspective, even Zixu and Bigan are not worthy of esteem.

"As for what you, Qiu, have said to persuade me: if you spoke to me of ghostly matters, I would not understand. But if you speak of human affairs, they do not exceed these examples—all are things I have heard and known.

"Now let me tell you of human nature: the eyes desire to see beauty, the ears to hear music, the mouth to savor fine flavors, and the will and qi seek fulfillment. The longest-lived reach a hundred years, the average eighty, the shortest sixty. Subtract illness, grief, death, and cares, and in a month, how many moments are there when one opens their mouth to laugh? No more than four or five at most.

"Heaven and earth are without end, but human death comes at its appointed time. Clutching this finite vessel and entrusting it to the boundless, it vanishes in an instant—no different from a swift steed galloping past a crack. Those who cannot delight their will and nurture their lives are not masters of the Dao.

"All that you, Qiu, have said, I reject. Hurry, leave and return home. Speak no more of it. Your Way is frantic and erratic, a web of deceit, cunning, and falsity. It cannot preserve the true. What is there to discuss?"

Confucius hastened away, exited the gate, mounted his carriage, and three times dropped the reins. His complexion was ashen, his head bowed against the crossbar, unable to catch his breath. Returning to the outskirts of Lu’s eastern gate, he encountered Liuxia Ji.

Liuxia Ji said, "Lately, you have been absent for several days, and your carriage and horses bear signs of travel. Might you have gone to see Robber Zhi?"

Confucius looked to the heavens and sighed, "Indeed."

Liuxia Ji asked, "Did Robber Zhi perhaps oppose your intentions as before?"

Confucius replied, "I thought myself free of illness, yet I cauterized myself. I rushed to stroke a tiger’s head and braid its whiskers—how nearly I did not escape its jaws!"

Chen Bixu’s Annotation:
The common folk of the world, who treat life lightly and court death—how do they differ from dogs and swine amid the rushing pebbles, resentful and fleeing in desperation? Like a gourd adrift in the current, they all sacrifice their innate, nurtured lives for the sake of posthumous fame. Those who chase externals grieve that their names will not be praised after death, willingly perishing without turning back. Those who turn inward pursue the joys of the present as enlightenment, flowing with the course of things without adornment. Moreover, the enduring vastness of heaven and earth, the radiant brilliance of sun and moon, are boundless and infinite. Yet now, within the fleeting span of a life, the brief breath of an instant, one entrusts oneself to their midst—yet cannot freely delight the heart and spirit, instead tormenting body and mind to scheme for posthumous fame. Thus, one loses the pristine Way of antiquity. Even in Robber Zhi’s ferocity and stubbornness, the themes he discussed were such that even Confucius could not refute them.

*Yanzhai Oral Exegesis*:
"Gushing spring" is a metaphor for the supremacy of qi. "Whirlwind" signifies lightness and elevation. "Yulun withered" describes calloused hands and feet. "Pebbles" and "swine in the torrent" illustrate how one throws oneself into slaughter like dogs and pigs. "Li" means attachment, indicating clinging to fame. "Not contemplating the root" means losing one’s original, true nature. "Ji" is synonymous with "drawing water." "Qi" means "none." *Chu’s Limited Insights*: A father cannot instruct his son, an elder brother cannot teach his younger brother—this is the misfortune of human relationships. Rampaging across the world, plundering and violent without satiety—this is the misfortune of the people. The Master sought to transform the world through virtue, power, benevolence, and righteousness, yet all followed like shadows and echoes, save for Robber Zhi, who alone could not be swayed—and instead, the Master suffered humiliation at his hands. This is the misfortune of the sage. Yet the Master is like the sun and moon: though momentarily entangled with malevolent eclipses or obscured by drifting sands, how could this ever harm his enduring purpose? For without contrasting the extremes of good and evil to sharpen the argument, or employing vivid imagery to articulate his meaning, his words would fail to fully convey his intent. This is why the sage and the madman are intertwined. The Master first presented the Three Virtues, admonishing him with the lowest, akin to persuading King Wen of Zhao with the Three Swords. Examining Robber Zhi’s words, though born of stubborn disputation, they nonetheless contain their own logic, which cannot be entirely dismissed merely because of the speaker. Yet he observed only the surface and did not grasp the heart, hence the discord in their discourse. This chapter’s language is bold and its spirit unbound, like a surging torrent that cannot be dammed, making it difficult to pin down with commentary. Thus, Master Guo, in his notes on these three chapters, briefly outlines the general meaning, allowing the essence to emerge naturally. Readers must not let the words obscure the intent.

"Shuhu" should be read as "shu" (pivot), pronounced like "ku gou." "Crown of branch-wood" refers to a hat made from the bark of young trees. "Tattered robes" are garments with wide sleeves, like the robes of recluses. "Displaying the corpse is called 'li.'" "Liu" means "boiling." "Li ming" should be "li ming" (profit and fame).

Zizhang asked Mang Goude, "Why do you not act?"
Mang Goude replied, "Without action, there is no trust; without trust, no responsibility; without responsibility, no profit. Thus, one observes fame and calculates profit, and righteousness is deemed true. If one abandons fame and profit and returns to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct cannot be neglected for even a day!"
Mang Goude said, "The shameless grow rich, the deceitful gain prominence. The greatest fame and profit lie in shamelessness and deceit. Thus, one observes fame and calculates profit, and trust is deemed true. If profit is sought, one returns to the heart, and the scholar’s conduct embraces the celestial."
Zizhang said, "In ancient times, Jie and Zhou were exalted as Sons of Heaven, possessing all under heaven. If today you told Zang Ju, ‘Your conduct is like Jie and Zhou,’ he would flush with anger and harbor resentment—such is the disdain of petty men. Confucius and Mo Di were impoverished commoners, yet if today you told a prime minister, ‘Your conduct is like Confucius and Mo Di,’ he would change his expression and deem it insufficient—such is the true esteem of the scholar. Thus, being the Son of Heaven does not necessarily confer nobility, nor does being a poor commoner necessarily confer baseness. The distinction between noble and base lies in the beauty or ugliness of one’s conduct."
Mang Goude said, "Petty thieves are imprisoned, while great thieves become lords. At the gates of lords, righteous scholars reside. In the past, Duke Huan of Qi killed his brother and took his sister-in-law, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister. Tian Chengzi murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted his gifts. In theory, they are despised; in practice, they are deferred to. Is this not a contradiction in word and deed, clashing within the heart? Is it not perverse?"
Thus, the *Book* says: "Who is evil? Who is good? The successful are heads, the unsuccessful are tails."
Zizhang said, "If you do not act, then kinship and affection lack order, noble and base lack righteousness, elder and younger lack sequence. How can the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished?"
Mang Goude replied, "Yao killed his eldest son, Shun exiled his younger brother—where is the order in kinship? Tang exiled Jie, King Wu attacked Zhou—where is the righteousness in noble and base? King Ji was the rightful heir, yet the Duke of Zhou killed his brother—where is the sequence in elder and younger? The Confucians’ hypocritical words, the Mohists’ doctrine of universal love—how can the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished? Moreover, you rectify for fame, I rectify for profit. The reality of fame and profit does not accord with principle, nor does it reflect the Way. Daily, I debate with you before Wu Yue, saying: ‘The petty man dies for wealth, the gentleman dies for fame.’ Though their emotions change and their natures differ in what they pursue, when it comes to abandoning what they do for what they do not, they are the same. Thus, it is said: Do not be a petty man, turn back and die for the celestial. Do not be a gentleman, follow the principle of heaven. Whether crooked or straight, observe and align with the celestial limit. Face the four directions, ebb and flow with the times. Whether right or wrong, grasp the round mechanism, stand alone in intent, and wander with the Way. Without turning to act, without completing righteousness, you will lose what you seek."

Do not rush toward wealth, do not die for success—you will abandon heaven thereby.

Bi Gan had his heart carved out, Wu Zixu had his eyes gouged—these were the calamities of loyalty. Zhi Gong testified against his father, Weisheng drowned holding the bridge—these were the perils of trust. Master Bao stood until he withered, Master Shen did not defend himself—these were the harms of integrity. Confucius did not see his mother, Kuangzi did not see his father—these were the failures of righteousness. These are what the ancients transmitted and later generations discuss, believing that the scholar must align his words with his conduct, and thus bear his misfortunes and suffer his afflictions.

Guo’s Commentary: This chapter says that when conduct is exalted, conduct becomes forced; when scholars are valued, scholars become false. Thus, one must despise conduct and belittle scholars to preserve one’s inner truth—only then will conduct be lofty and scholars esteemed.

Lü’s Commentary: Good and evil stand opposed, so Confucius could not transform Robber Zhi. Fame and profit stand opposed, so Zizhang could not persuade the Greedy One. The Greedy One is the one who debated with Wu Yue. Zizhang studied to seek office, so he knew of fame; the Greedy One knew of profit, while Wu Yue embodied the Dao and was trustworthy. To do evil for profit—this the world calls the petty man. To do good for fame—this the world calls the gentleman. This is speaking in terms of the human Dao. In terms of the celestial Dao, the world’s gentlemen are heaven’s petty men. If one follows heaven and accords with its principle, then gentleman and petty man cannot be distinguished. Crooked or straight, observe the celestial mean—then there is no crooked or straight. Face the four directions, ebb and flow with the times—then though centered, do not cling to center as center. This is how the Dao pervades the six directions and opens the four gates, nowhere absent!

Right and wrong are equally boundless. Grasp the round mechanism and respond to all without fail; stand alone in intent and wander with the Way. Then, hesitating to act, you will succeed in every endeavor. All such things are how one reaches heaven. Without turning to act, you will abandon heaven—this is one’s own heaven, not letting human affairs nullify heaven’s decree.

Loyalty, trust, integrity, righteousness—these the world calls fame and goodness, yet all incur misfortune. The world knows only that profit and evil are burdens, but does not realize that fame and goodness are also not the Dao. Thus Wu Yue’s discourse repeatedly returns to this.

Yi Du’s Commentary: Zizhang walked like Yu and hurried like Shun, inviting suspicion of following in their tracks. Zhuangzi, criticizing the nearness of sages, used this to establish his argument. Full yet striving for gain—his pursuit of fame is evident. Conduct is the visible manifestation of virtue. When one has conduct and people trust it, profit follows. Fame and profit arise from trust and conduct; trust and conduct, in turn, arise from righteousness. Zizhang’s discourse centered on righteousness, so when he observed fame and calculated profit, righteousness was genuine. If one abandons fame and profit and returns to the root to observe, then the scholar’s conduct cannot be absent for a single day.

For conduct: conduct oneself with shame, and one’s words are valued for their restraint. The shameless call wealth “gain,” the overly trusting call display “prominence”—this is using many words to seek others’ trust, not possessing trust within oneself. Without shame, one seizes wealth at any cost; with excessive trust, one adorns words to seek advancement. This discourse says that acting for conduct is worse than acting for words. If one abandons fame and profit and returns to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct merely embraces heaven without knowing humanity.

The world’s restless pursuers of fame and profit constantly let human affairs obliterate heaven, so their words are thus. Zizhang said Jie and Zhou had no conduct, so petty men were ashamed to emulate them; Kong and Mo had conduct, so even the noble deferred. The distinction between noble and base lies not in power’s rise or fall, but in conduct’s beauty or ugliness.

The Greedy One further argued that petty thieves steal wealth and are controlled by others; great thieves steal states, become lords, and none can control them—they even steal their sagacity, wisdom, and the seven virtues. Formerly, Duke Huan and Tian Heng were great thieves, yet Guan Zhong served them. Confucius accepted their gifts—judging by words, he belittled their thievery; judging by conduct, he accepted gifts as a minister. Is this not a contradiction in his heart? He also cited the lost *Book*, implying that it is not conduct’s beauty or ugliness that matters, but success as the measure—then regicide and usurpation are not necessarily unprofitable.

Zizhang further said that without conduct, noble and base, close and distant lose order—how can there be norms for ruler and minister, father and son? The Greedy One cited sages and worthies who violated norms and lost order as proof. Moreover, acting for fame or profit both violate the Dao—abandoning the root to chase the branch is the same. “Do not be a petty man” to “you will abandon heaven”—Wu Yue thus explained the earlier meaning and admonished them. “Turning to act, completing righteousness” speaks of the error of pursuing fame. “Rushing toward wealth, dying for success” speaks of the error of pursuing profit. Only without pursuit, in accord with nature, is perfection.

Bi Gan and those below—these ancient men of loyalty, trust, integrity, and righteousness who invited disaster—serve as warnings. Bi Xu’s Commentary: The scholar in the world first cultivates trust and conduct, then service follows; when service is clear, emolument follows; when emolument is clear, office is prominent and righteousness manifest. If one abandons fame and profit and reflects inward, then for even a moment one cannot forsake conduct and righteousness.

*Xin* (trust) sounds like *shen* (extension), as below—worldly scholars endure disgrace to extend themselves, seeking abundant profit and fame, clamoring unceasingly for coarse clothes and meager food. If one abandons fame and profit and reflects inward, not relying on cultivation and adornment but embracing and guarding heaven’s mandate to await it—Jie and Zhou had position but no conduct, so petty men were ashamed to join them. Kong and Mo had no position but had conduct, so ministers and lords revered them, valuing virtue over position.

Confucians are slippery and unfit to emulate; Mohists self-righteously prepare for the world’s crises—how can they distinguish the Dao of ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife?

Those who now claim the title of scholar are neither drowned in fame nor buried in profit—yet both remain contrary to principle, still unable to cast off their bonds. In the past, those of us below you and I shared no binding words. What we did was follow our own nature; what we did not do was contrived. Things are not done for profit—one simply returns to one’s natural state; they are not done for fame—one merely follows heaven’s principle. If one merely assists your natural endowment, then questions of right and wrong are discarded and no longer debated. With every glance unobstructed and every action grounded, holding fast to your judgments without being swayed by others’ approval or disapproval—this is called the "round mechanism." When the mind is not entangled with things, one stands alone and wanders with the Dao.

If conduct is facile, one chases after circumstances; if righteousness is achieved, one loses authenticity and forfeits one’s purpose. Zizhang took this as the practice of conduct and righteousness—yet those who hasten toward wealth invite disaster, and those who seek completion often fail and abandon heaven’s mandate. If one attains by chance, it is through shamelessness that one extends oneself further. Yuanzhai said: Zizhang believed that to seek fame and profit, one must cultivate righteousness as the proper path. But if one abandons fame and profit, the heart rebels, finding no joy in itself—thus one must pursue them, and nothing but the practice of righteousness will suffice. Those who place excessive trust do so by speaking trustworthy words to seek glory and prominence. "Attaining by chance" refers to those who now seek fame and profit through deceit alone. Yet if one abandons fame and profit and returns to the heart, one must still attain them—indulging the heart’s desires as if preserving one’s natural innocence without artifice. The true nature of words and actions clashes within, for they do not align. Success and failure, beginning and end—when one gains favor, one becomes a righteous follower; when one loses it, one becomes a usurper. This shows that the practice of transforming righteousness is all pretense, not natural truth.

The Five Constants, the Six Positions, and the Three Bonds—you may take the names of benevolence and righteousness as attainment, but I act only for profit, without borrowing the pretense of such names. For fame and profit are not true principles. "No binding words" is a metaphor for nature: if one can follow nature, then there are no distinctions of gentleman or petty man, right or wrong—all is seen as the ultimate principle of nature. The four directions correspond to the four seasons, and all movement and stillness are but a single qi. Grasping the round mechanism, one is free from right and wrong; trusting the mind to act alone, one moves with ease along the central Way.

To turn one’s conduct is to turn from the Dao. To "achieve righteousness" is to succeed through righteousness. "None" is interchangeable with "do not."

Should one insist that words be strictly followed to align with loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and righteousness, calamity and harm will surely befall—this means that feigning virtue to seek profit and success is no better than acting without pretense, for it distorts Mencius’ distinction between the Heavenly nobility and the human nobility. Conduct is the outward manifestation of righteousness, while trust and profit serve as its validation. Righteousness arises from within, and when conduct is revealed externally, trust and profit follow from without; thus, examining fame and profit reveals the truth of righteousness. If one does not speak of fame and profit but instead turns inward to the heart, then the scholar’s practice of righteousness cannot be abandoned even for a day. For the scholar’s duty is to act with righteousness, and whether fame or profit come or not is of no concern—this is the argument of Zizhang.

Seeking trust through excessive speech is the path to wealth and prominence, and the shameless regard this as right. Yet if one disregards fame and profit and turns inward to the heart, then the one who acts does so holding fast to their Heavenly nature, untouched by worldly concerns—this is the argument of the unprincipled. Zizhang was a disciple of Confucius, while the unprincipled were those who corrupted the Way; thus, their views naturally opposed each other.

As for the loftiest discourse—those who hoard wealth yet feel shame at being compared to Jie and Zhou, or ministers who dare not equal Confucius and Mozi—such conduct is truly noble. Yet when petty thieves are imprisoned while great thieves become lords, profit becomes a delight. This further cites the ancient sages to show that each had their biases and could not avoid flaws. The arguments of these two were not aligned, so the unprincipled once debated Zizhang on the principle of "no binding words."

The petty man pursues wealth to the end of the chapter, where the discourse on "no binding words" concludes: both men were bound to their partialities and thus did not accord with the Dao. Better to forget good and evil entirely, to be bound to nothing, and to follow nature—then there is no division between gentleman and petty man, and each attains the correctness of their nature. What room is there for distinctions of right and wrong, inner and outer, or judgments of truth and falsehood?

This is the state of solitary completion, unburdened by external things, thus wandering with the Dao without ever losing it. But if one alters their natural conduct to seek the name of righteousness, or chases wealth and profit in hopes of success, they abandon and extinguish their Heavenly principle, drowning in external things. The examples from Bi Gan’s heart-cutting onward illustrate how those who cling to partialities cannot avoid disaster, yet scholars still take their words as correct, emulate their conduct, and suffer calamity and ruin without awakening.

How lamentable!

*The Southern Florescence: An Exegesis on the Ocean of Meanings of the True Classic, Scroll Ninety-Six*

**Robber Zhi, Part Two**

Wu of No Feet asked Zhi of Knowing Harmony: "Among men, none ultimately fail to pursue fame and profit. Those who grow wealthy draw others to them; those who draw others humble themselves before them; those who humble themselves before them esteem them. To see the esteemed and the humbled—this is the Way of long life, bodily ease, and joyful intent. Yet you alone show no such intent. Is your knowledge insufficient? Or do you know but lack the strength to act? Or do you deliberately reject the upright and cling to error?"

Zhi of Knowing Harmony replied: "Consider those whom this man deems his contemporaries, born in the same age and dwelling in the same village—he regards them as transcendent beings who surpass the common world. Yet they lack any steadfast principle, merely surveying the times of past and present, the distinctions of right and wrong, and conforming to custom. They cast aside what is most weighty, abandon what is most honorable, all for the sake of what they do. How far this is from the Way of long life, bodily ease, and joyful intent!

Grievous pain and serene joy are not reflected in the body; trembling fear and trembling delight are not reflected in the heart. They know how to act but not *why* they act—thus, though they be honored as Son of Heaven and possess all under Heaven, they cannot escape suffering."

Wu of No Feet said: "Wealth brings every advantage to man. It exhausts beauty and exhausts power, reaching what even the perfected cannot attain, what the worthy cannot match. It wields the courage and strength of others to augment its might, employs the wisdom and schemes of others to sharpen its discernment, and appropriates the virtue of others to adorn its goodness. Though it does not rule a state, it commands reverence like a lord or father.

Moreover, the allure of sounds and sights, flavors and power—these delight the heart without need of learning, and the body finds ease in them without need of imitation. Desires and aversions, attractions and avoidances—these require no teacher, for they are man’s very nature. Though all under Heaven may condemn me, who can renounce them?"

Zhi of Knowing Harmony replied: "The actions of the wise move in accord with the people and do not transgress their measure. Thus, contentment brings no contention, and having no ulterior purpose, they seek nothing. Those who lack contentment seek and contend in all directions yet do not deem themselves greedy; those who have surplus relinquish it, even casting aside all under Heaven, yet do not deem themselves modest. The true nature of modesty and greed lies not in external compulsion but in returning to one’s inner measure.

Though one wields the power of the Son of Heaven, one does not use nobility to lord over others; though one possesses all under Heaven, one does not use wealth to toy with others. Calculating the harm, considering the consequences, one sees that these bring injury to one’s nature—thus one declines and does not accept, not to seek fame or reputation.

Yao and Shun ruled as emperors and brought harmony, yet they did not act out of benevolence toward all under Heaven but to avoid allowing beauty to harm life. Shan Juan and Xu You were offered the throne yet refused it, not out of empty deference but to avoid allowing affairs to harm themselves. All these pursued what benefited them and declined what harmed them. Though all under Heaven called them worthy, they did not act to cultivate fame or reputation."

Wu of No Feet said: "If one must cling to reputation, endure bodily hardship, and deny sweetness to preserve life, one is no different from a chronically ill man who drags himself along a long slope, never dying."

Zhi of Knowing Harmony replied: "Equilibrium brings blessing, while excess brings harm—this is true of all things, but wealth is the most extreme case. Now, the rich man’s ears are filled with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes; his mouth savors the tastes of fine meats and sweet wines, stirring his intent and causing him to neglect his affairs—this may be called chaos. He drowns in arrogance, as if bearing a heavy burden while climbing—this may be called suffering. Greedy for wealth, he exhausts himself; greedy for power, he depletes himself. At rest, he drowns; in comfort, he swells—this may be called sickness. Seeking wealth and profit, he fills his ears like a wall yet does not know to avoid harm, pressing forward without cease—this may be called disgrace. Wealth accumulates yet goes unused; he clings to it without release, his heart filled with sorrow and resentment, seeking ever more without end—this may be called anxiety. Within, he fears the treachery of flatterers; without, he dreads the harm of bandits and thieves. Within, he surrounds himself with high towers and moats; without, he dares not walk alone—this may be called fear.

These six are the greatest harms under Heaven, yet men neglect and fail to examine them. When calamity strikes, they exhaust their nature and squander their wealth, seeking in vain to return to a single day of carefree ease. Thus, when they look for fame, they find it not; when they seek profit, they gain it not. They strain their intent and exhaust their bodies in pursuit of this—is this not delusion?"

**Guo’s Annotation:** This chapter speaks of how those who know contentment are ever content.
**Lü’s Annotation:** Wu of No Feet takes wealth as the means to see others humbled and esteemed, deeming it the Way of bodily ease and joyful intent. Zhi of Knowing Harmony, however, holds that the wealthy, though born in the same age and dwelling in the same village, are readily humbled and esteemed by the world—this shows their lack of inner principle. They conform to custom, casting aside what is most weighty and most honorable, mistaking worldly pursuits for the Way. How far this is from bodily ease and joyful intent!

Grievous pain and serene joy are not reflected in the body; trembling fear and trembling delight are not reflected in the heart—thus they know how to act but not *why* they act. This is like using the Marquis of Sui’s pearl to shoot a sparrow at a thousand *ren*’s height. Though one may be most noble and most wealthy, one cannot escape suffering—how much less those who are content with wealth?

Wu of No Feet takes wealth as the natural inclination of man, asking who can renounce it. Zhi of Knowing Harmony holds that those who do not know contentment cannot yield even an inch, thus contending in all directions yet not deeming themselves greedy. Those who know contentment do not take all under Heaven as their own, thus casting it aside yet not deeming themselves modest. The true nature of modesty and greed lies in returning to one’s inner measure.

*Measure* refers to the varying capacities of vessels, implying that human nature is not uniform—this cannot be so. "Drowning in arrogance" speaks of relying on abundant resources, their *qi* swelling with pride. "In comfort, he swells" means that when the body is sleek and well-nourished, one relies on it and neglects self-preservation. The text exhaustively describes the harms of wealth, showing how it ultimately leads to this: when one looks for fame, it is not seen; when one seeks profit, it is not gained.

Those who twist their intentions and sever their bodies in contention—this is what was earlier called "acting for the sake of harmony yet not knowing why one acts." Confucius could not transform Robber Zhi, and Zizhang could not subdue the covetous; the covetous took what was right from Wu Yue, while Wu Zu was humbled by One Who Knows Harmony. Thus, it is clear that neither good nor evil, fame nor profit, can overcome one another—only virtue and the Dao can prevail.

*Dubious Annotation*: Those without enough to eat yet unaware of their portion say that no one does not desire to rise in fame and pursue profit. When people covet another’s wealth, they submit to and serve them; being thus submitted to, one may nourish their own nobility, and their heart rejoices. Why then do you have no such intention? Is your wisdom insufficient to attain this, or your strength unable to act? Or do you persist in right principle yet still harbor the mind of one who abandons it to seek sustenance?

One Who Knows Harmony responds: Those who now love profit and desire wealth, lacking inner constancy, do not even enjoy their own riches and honor but merely take pride in sharing the same life and village with the wealthy. They consider this surpassing the world and transcending custom—yet in truth, they are transformed along with the world. Thus, they abandon life, the weightiest of all, and cast aside the Dao, the most exalted, believing that what others do is beyond their capacity, unable to entrust themselves to Heaven’s spontaneous action. Are they not far indeed from the Dao?

Human nature is stirred by things, moved by what the body does not inherently possess and the heart does not inherently hold. Those who act for the sake of acting love action; the reason for acting lies in non-action, where nothing is left undone. Only because people do not understand non-action do they, though dwelling in the utmost wealth and honor, still fail to escape exhaustion.

Wu Zu further says: Wealth’s power over others exhausts all beauty under Heaven and reaches the limits of all influence—even sages and worthies cannot match it, nor can virtue and the Dao overcome it. The brave enhance its might, the wise sharpen its discernment; it borrows others’ virtue to appear worthy, and though without rank, it commands reverence like a lord or father. Such are the affairs of the wealthy.

As for sounds and sights, flavors and pleasures, power and influence—these are what all people desire, needing no learning to know them, for they are the nature manifest in emotion. Who under Heaven can refuse them?

One Who Knows Harmony again says: The wise act for the sake of the people, not deviating from their measure. This measure is the law of the heart. Thus, being content, they contend for nothing; acting without contrivance, they seek nothing. Those who are now discontent seek in all directions and contend to obtain, yet do not deem themselves greedy or excessive. Therefore, though they gain all under Heaven, they may decline it without deeming themselves modest. The names of greed and modesty, though seen outwardly, arise inwardly; reflecting within, one knows this well.

Not using nobility to domineer over others ensures long retention of nobility; not using wealth to toy with others ensures long retention of wealth. Perceiving this in its subtlety, calculating gains and losses, fearing harm to one’s nature, one declines and does not accept—not to seek fame and reputation, yet the world naturally ascribes fame and reputation to them. Yao and Shun’s yielding to Xu You and Shan Juan’s refusal of office were both cases of avoiding harm and declining profit, not seeking fame, yet fame arose nonetheless.

Wu Zu says of One Who Knows Harmony’s aspirations: Clinging to fame and reputation, tormenting the body and rejecting pleasure—how is this different from a long illness, enduring suffering without dying?

One Who Knows Harmony says: Among all things under Heaven, equilibrium is fortune, excess is misfortune—and wealth is the most extreme! Now the wealthy are deluded by external desires, neglecting their fundamental tasks, obstructed by unruly *qi*, like one bearing a heavy load while climbing high. Can this not be called suffering? Coveting wealth and power to comfort the heart and exhaust the mind, when at rest they drown in desire; when the body is sleek, they rely on it and act recklessly. If they seek and do not obtain, illness arises. Amassing wealth like a wall, clinging without release, disgrace will come! The ancients accumulated wealth and stored grain to prepare for famine, disease, and calamity in their villages, using it to aid others and perfect virtue. Now the wealthy hoard without use, endlessly seeking more, their worries accumulating within, their thoughts unceasing; guarding and protecting without, they prepare for everything. Wealth is the greatest harm under Heaven! All neglect to consider the threat of thieves and bandits, who will seek to take everything—by then, the nature of life is already exhausted. Having depleted their accumulated wealth, they may even long to return to a single day of poverty, carefree and unburdened—but this cannot be obtained!

Yet they still entangle their intentions with deep thoughts and sever their bodies to fend off calamity. Is this not delusion?

*Blue Void Annotation*: This chapter further explains the previous two. Those who seek fame desire nobility; those who pursue profit desire wealth. These are the paths to ease—who lacks such intentions? Some are dull-witted and unaware; others know but lack the strength to act. Persisting in right principle without forgetting, they say they entrust themselves to fate and do not take—what then do they have to do with wealth and honor? The worldly take pride in sharing the same era and village with the wealthy, considering it surpassing others. But those with inner constancy are not swayed by things; those who comprehend past and present are not moved by affairs.

Nothing is weightier than the self; nothing is weightier than life. Yet now, conforming to custom and being transformed by the world, they abandon what is weightiest and cast aside what is most exalted, believing in what others do and unable to entrust themselves to Heaven’s spontaneous action. How far are they from the way of peace for the body and joy for the mind?

In poverty and lowliness, they are fearful and anxious; in wealth and honor, they are indulgent and complacent—this is obscuring the root and prizing the traces. Those who act for the sake of acting pursue fame and profit, unaware of what wealth and honor truly are. Abandoning their own spontaneous action to seek what is pursued, they know they cannot escape it.

The ants in a mound gather around stench; the scholar who covers his face in shame refuses food offered with contempt. Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; people forget one another in the arts of the Dao—what need is there for reliance or coercion?

The unrestrained delight in sounds and sights; the arrogant and extravagant find comfort in power and influence—this is human nature. Who does not desire it? Acting for the sake of the people is not for oneself. Not deviating from their measure means reducing selfishness and curbing desire.

"Contending in all directions" refers to waging war across the four quarters.

Their aspiration lies in pacifying the people, not in coveting treasures and goods—thus they are not greedy. Yet when their merit is accomplished and their name established, they abdicate their position with propriety, not considering themselves paragons of integrity.

Prince Sou fled into the cinnabar caves; Yan He fed oxen to decline an official summons—did they seek fame and reputation? Shun offered the world to Shan Juan, but Shan Juan, tending his fields, paid no heed—did he seek fame and reputation?

Those obsessed with gluttony regard tranquility as sickness and solitude as cowardice, unaware that ease is fortune and excess is harm. Wealth invites swift disaster, more ruinous than other things, yet the world remains blind to this.

When men of tranquility and solitude observe bells, drums, fine wine, and rich feasts, they see the ruin of the Dao and its practices. When they observe surfeit and luxury, they see the stirring of hardship and suffering. When they observe those who seek comfort in power and influence, they see them drowning in bodily afflictions. When they observe those who snatch gold without hesitation, they see them suffering worse than execution and disgrace.

Yet the hoarding never ceases, and anxiety and fear never dissipate. Once disaster strikes and their lives collapse, they only wish their accumulated wealth would swiftly vanish. At such a time, their true nature is exhausted, their wealth depleted. They long to release hawks and hounds on the hunting grounds, to hear the cranes cry at Huating—how could such things ever be regained?

*Yunzhai notes: "This refers to the wealthy and powerful."*
They possess no lofty, unattainable conduct; their hearts lack constancy, and they lose their true nature, swayed by common customs. It is nothing more than observing the inclinations of past and present to seek personal gain.

What is most weighty and revered—heavenly principle—they abandon and forsake, solely pursuing what they call the quest for wealth and honor. How can this be the way to peace of body and joy of mind?

What they do is human effort; why they do it is heavenly principle. To abandon heavenly principle and not follow it, even the Son of Heaven cannot escape calamity—how much less those beneath him?

The wealthy and powerful exhaust all that is beautiful and excellent, wielding all their power and influence. Even the most realized persons and worthies cannot match them. They employ others, rely on others—all speak of their power to command things, as the common saying goes: "Wealth can reach the gods."

Though the world may deem me wrong, how can I evade it? This is the speech of those who set themselves above others.

The wise act with the shared endowment of heaven in the people as their guiding principle, never daring to transgress the laws and measures. When their virtue suffices for themselves, they have nothing to contend over. Their actions do not depend on others, and their pursuits involve no entanglement.

The four quarters are the four directions. The essence of integrity and responsibility does not lie in external pursuits but in seeking heavenly principle and the laws, reflecting upon them. Turning inward to consider, they do not let a fine reputation harm themselves. Though they possess the world, they do not cling to it; though worthy fame returns to them, they feel no shame. They do not seek to establish fame and reputation—this is how Yao, Shun, and Xu You are all spoken of with approval.

*Wu Zu says:* If one must seek fame and not wealth, they merely torment their body. Though their body remains, it is as if afflicted with a lingering, undying illness.

The lines *"Ease is fortune; excess is harm—wealth in its extremity"* are most profound.

*Xian* means to stuff one’s mouth full. *Hai ni* means to be ill at ease. *Feng qi* means anger that blocks the qi. *Wei* means satisfaction. *Qu jie* means to exhaust all effort.

Though they dwell in stillness, they are submerged in desires; their bodies grow plump and sleek, bearing the air of arrogance and surfeit. Their wealth piles up like a wall, clung to without release; sorrow and anxiety fill their chests. What they hoard within, they fear others will seize; what they deploy without, they fear bandits and thieves will plunder—truly, they are beset by worry and dread.

When disaster arrives, though they wish to preserve their lives and relinquish their wealth, they cannot achieve even a day’s peace like a poor man. Their nature is spent, their wealth exhausted. *Dan* means alone. *Liao yi jue ti* means their minds and bodies are bound.

*Wu Zu* delights in profit, so he speaks of the wealthy enjoying peace of body and joy of mind. If one attains wealth to live in the world and nurture life, nothing is not beneficial.

*Zhi He* pursues harmony in fame, so his actions never transgress measure. Content, he does not seek more; calculating gain and reflecting on return, he knows profit cannot be relied upon and that greed swiftly invites disaster. Thus he declines and does not accept—not to seek reputation, for reputation comes to him of its own accord.

*Wu Zu* further mocks those who cling to fame and torment their bodies, no different from living with a diseased gallbladder. *Zhi He* tells him that ease is fortune and excess is harm, expounding the ultimate discourse of the world. *Wu Zu* is thus convinced in his heart.

From here to the end of the chapter, it thoroughly describes the schemes and machinations of the wealthy, which cannot escape the discernment of the enlightened. Yet all is of no benefit to themselves, and in the end, they cannot avoid becoming mere hoarders for great thieves.

When disaster arrives, it is too late to realize their error. As Shi Chong sighed at the execution ground, "My slaves only coveted my wealth."

The *Nanhua* bewilders in this way; those who hear it should take it as a warning.

*Gai* is pronounced *gai*, meaning extraordinary. *Feng* is pronounced *ping*, meaning pent-up frustration. *Jiao* is the same as *jiao* (scorched). *Lou shu* refers to windows. *Liao rao qi yi* means deep contemplation. *Ci jue qi ti* means forgetting life.

*Liu Gai says:* If the world has no right and wrong, right and wrong arise from human sentiment. If the world has right and wrong, right and wrong dissolve in human nature. The virtue of right is auspicious; the virtue of wrong is inauspicious. The *Book of Changes* says: "Auspicious and inauspicious are the victory of correctness."

Those who cannot unite in correctness and forget distinctions, but instead entangle themselves in the realm of human effort, each valuing themselves and belittling others—who can settle this? Thus, though Confucius and Robber Zhi are divided, they call each other thieves.

Zhuangzi was not unaware of honoring Confucius and despising Robber Zhi. But because the world does not awaken to the principle of forgetting distinctions, they vie with knowledge and boast of ability. If one were to follow sentiment and honor them, right and wrong would become even more pronounced, and the true nature of life would grow ever more chaotic.

Thus, by borrowing what the world universally condemns to confound one’s self-righteous sentiments, even a sage cannot prevail in debate. Therefore, the chapter concludes by deeming Zizhang’s words inadequate and ending with the discourse on *zhihe* (knowing harmony).

Master Chu’s comprehensive commentary states: Robber Zhi’s arguments, though forceful in sophistry and self-aggrandizement, ultimately forced even the sagely and wise to concede—making him the most violent and wicked in the world. Some critics condemn the text for its irreverence toward the sacred, attributing it to later fabrications, but this reasoning is flawed. The benevolence of Confucius and the brutality of Robber Zhi are self-evident, requiring no debate. The purpose of such discourse is to illuminate the perfection of the Master’s sagely Dao and the vastness of his accommodating virtue. Yet how could Robber Zhi truly comprehend the source of the Master’s sageliness? Judging conduct by conduct, discerning hearts by hearts—his arguments, though seemingly sound, merely reflect his own limited understanding of the Master. Had Robber Zhi fully grasped the Master’s sageliness, he would no longer be Zhi. Thus, though the Master appeared subdued, his reputation grew ever more exalted; though Zhi exalted himself, his infamy only deepened. The world’s shared sense of right and wrong remains undiminished.

Expounding upon the words to unfold their meaning, the various interpretations are manifold, none surpassing another. Yet I discern an implicit subtlety often overlooked: readers routinely dismiss the text as irreverent, leaving its profound truth obscured for millennia. Thus, I offer this rectification. The original intent was to satirize the rulers and ministers of the time, who, clinging to wealth and power, wielded life and death arbitrarily, impervious to moral transformation. Even were Confucius to return, he would not escape their humiliation. Hence, the text compares them to Robber Zhi, with Confucius speaking in his own voice.

Next, it presents Zizhang’s question on *man gou de* (fulfillment through unprincipled gain). Those who seek fulfillment through such means receive answers no different from Zhi’s. All such arguments aim to prevail over others, blind to the loss of authenticity, the betrayal of principle, and the estrangement from the Dao.

Following this, Wu Zu asks about *zhihe* (knowing harmony), his ambition fixed on fame and profit, prioritizing bodily comfort and personal gratification—another adherent of unprincipled gain. *Zhihe* responds: the wealthy value their accumulations yet know how to distribute them, benefiting the multitude and sustaining all things. The poor depend on them for survival, spared the misery of displacement and starvation. In ancient times, Tao Zhugong excelled in managing wealth; once rich, he dispersed his fortune among his neighbors. Thrice he gave away his wealth, thrice he relocated, even avoiding the reputation of virtue. Today’s wealthy, however, drown in sensual pleasures and insatiable desires, amassing fortunes like towering walls while harboring constant fear. The greater their wealth, the deeper their harm—witness the ruin of Jingu and Gold Valley as cautionary tales. They fare worse than those who till the soil for self-sufficiency, who may nurture life to its full span unburdened.

All this serves as a piercing needle to the world’s deep-seated maladies, subtly revealing the sagely and wise teachings. If scholars could truly abandon superficial traces and delve into the intent behind the words, dissolving the selfishness of fame and profit to return to the great root of the Dao, the transformative power of non-action and tranquility would suffice to bring benevolence and longevity to the Eight Directions—far beyond mere personal well-being.

Herein lies the *Nanhua*’s mission to defend the Dao and propagate transformation, its compassion for the times and pity for the people no different from that of Confucius and Mencius.

The *First Discourse on the Sword* by Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin

In ancient times, King Wen of Zhao was fond of swords. Over three thousand swordsmen gathered as retainers at his gates, clashing before him day and night. Each year, more than a hundred perished or were wounded, yet his passion never waned. After three years, the state declined, and the feudal lords plotted against it. The Crown Prince Kui grew anxious and offered a reward to his attendants: "Whoever can persuade the king to abandon his obsession with swordsmen shall receive a thousand gold pieces." His attendants replied, "Zhuangzi is the one who can do this."

The prince then sent an emissary bearing a thousand gold pieces to present to Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi declined the gift and accompanied the messenger to an audience, asking, "What instruction does the prince have for me, that he offers me a thousand gold pieces?" The prince said, "I have heard that you are enlightened and sagely. I humbly present this thousand gold as a gift for your attendants. If you refuse it, how dare I speak further?" Zhuangzi replied, "I have heard that the prince seeks my aid to end the king’s fondness for swords. If I persuade the king in a manner contrary to his wishes, offending him and failing to align with the prince’s intent, I would face execution. How then could I make use of the gold? But if I persuade the king in a way that pleases him and aligns with the prince’s intent, what in the state of Zhao could I not obtain?"

The prince said, "Indeed. My father, the king, sees only swordsmen." Zhuangzi replied, "Very well. I am skilled in the sword." The prince said, "Yet the swordsmen my father favors all have unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, slouching caps, tassels of coarse silk, short-backed robes, glaring eyes, and speak in harsh tones—this is what delights him. If you appear before the king in scholar’s robes, the outcome will surely be adverse." Zhuangzi said, "Allow me to prepare a swordsman’s attire."

After three days, the attire was ready, and the prince accompanied him to see the king. The king stood with bared blade, awaiting him. Zhuangzi entered the palace gates without haste and did not bow upon seeing the king. The king asked, "What instruction do you bring, that the prince has sent you before me?" Zhuangzi replied, "I have heard that Your Majesty is fond of swords, so I have come to present my swordsmanship." The king asked, "What power does your sword possess to restrain others?" Zhuangzi said, "My sword cuts down one man every ten paces and leaves no obstacle in a thousand *li*." The king was greatly pleased and exclaimed, "You would be invincible in the world!"

Zhuangzi said, "The way of the sword is to present emptiness, offer advantage, strike after the opponent moves, and arrive before they do. I wish to demonstrate this." The king said, "Rest now in your lodging. I shall issue a command to arrange a contest and summon you." The king then assembled swordsmen for seven days, during which over sixty were killed or wounded. Five or six were selected, and they stood bearing their swords at the foot of the hall. The king summoned Zhuangzi and said, "Today, let us test the swordsmen in a trial of skill." Zhuangzi replied, "I have long awaited this." The king asked, "What length of weapon do you wield?" Zhuangzi said, "Any length will suffice for me. However, I possess three swords, and I shall use whichever Your Majesty prefers. Allow me to describe them before demonstrating."

The king said, "I wish to hear of the three swords." Zhuangzi replied, "There is the Sword of the Son of Heaven, the Sword of the Feudal Lords, and the Sword of the Commoner."

The king asked, "What is the Sword of the Son of Heaven like?"
Zhuangzi said, "The Sword of the Son of Heaven has its blade forged from Yanxi and Shicheng, its edges from Qi and Mount Tai, its spine from Jin and Wei, its guard from Zhou and Song, and its grip from Han and Wei. It is encircled by the Four Barbarians and enveloped by the Four Seasons, bound by the Bohai Sea and girdled by Mount Chang."

Its regulation follows the Five Phases, its discourse balances punishment and virtue; its opening aligns with yin and yang, its grasp corresponds to spring and summer, its movement to autumn and winter. Pointed, it has nothing before it; raised, it has nothing above it; pressed, it has nothing below it; wielded, it has nothing beside it. Above, it cleaves the floating clouds; below, it severs the earth’s foundations. When this sword is once employed, it rectifies the feudal lords, and all under heaven submits. This is the Sword of the Son of Heaven.

King Wen, dazed, lost himself in thought, then asked, "What is the Sword of the Feudal Lords like?"
Zhuangzi said, "The Sword of the Feudal Lords has its blade forged from the wise and brave, its edges from the pure and incorrupt, its spine from the worthy and good, its guard from the loyal and sagely, and its grip from the heroic and outstanding. Pointed, it likewise has nothing before it; raised, it likewise has nothing above it; pressed, it likewise has nothing below it; wielded, it likewise has nothing beside it. Above, it models the round heavens to follow the Three Luminaries; below, it models the square earth to follow the Four Seasons; within, it comprehends the people’s will to pacify the four quarters. When this sword is once employed, it strikes like the thunder’s shock—within the four borders, none fail to submit in reverence. This is the Sword of the Feudal Lords."

The king asked, "What is the Sword of the Commoner like?"
Zhuangzi said, "The Sword of the Commoner: unkempt hair, disheveled topknot, dangling cap-strings, short-backed robes, glaring eyes, and quarrelsome speech. They clash before one another, above severing necks and throats, below piercing livers and lungs. This Sword of the Commoner differs not from fighting cocks—once their lives are spent, it serves no purpose in the affairs of state. Now Your Majesty holds the position of the Son of Heaven yet delights in the sword of the commoner; I humbly deem this unworthy of you."

The king then led him up to the hall. The royal chef presented the meal, and the king circled it thrice. Zhuangzi said, "May Your Majesty sit composed and settle your qi. The matter of the swords has been presented in full."

Thereupon, King Wen did not leave his palace for three months, and the swordsmen all submitted, dying in their places.

Guo’s commentary is silent. Lü’s commentary: "Zhuangzi’s conduct was such that he wished to drag his tail in the mud rather than become a sacrificial victim in the grand ancestral temple, awakening the world to the folly of risking life for mere things. Yet his discourse on swords remains unheard of—likely he borrowed this to illustrate that the Dao’s application knows no bounds. If one can halt a ruler’s harmful preferences and secure a state’s peril, the blessings bestowed are no small matter! Thus, those who embody the Dao act when the time is right."

Accepting their service while declining their gifts, the enlightened ruler makes clear that the noble person cannot be won by wealth. Adopting their attire and employing their rites, one aligns with their affairs—only then may words find entry.

The Son of Heaven’s sword is forged with all under heaven, demonstrating that the divine instrument of the realm cannot be wielded arbitrarily. By revealing its emptiness, enticing with advantage, following with action, and preceding with arrival, one grasps the Way of employing this divine instrument—achieving what cannot be achieved.

To know the root and branch, the light and heavy, and the methods by which it is regulated and applied, is to wield it such that all under heaven submits. From Yan and Han, Qi and Dai, to the Bohai and Mount Da, the Son of Heaven’s sword encompasses all under heaven. From the five phases, punishments, and virtues to the severing of earth’s bounds, it signifies the divine as timeless and boundless.

Only the spirit-like person may wield this divine instrument, thus correcting the feudal lords and bringing all under heaven to submission—this was the proven efficacy of Tang, Yu, and the Three Dynasties. Such was Zhuangzi’s purpose in discoursing on swords. Upon hearing this, King Wen felt a disorienting loss, realizing his own preference was not for the true sword.

The feudal lords’ sword is forged with a single state, thus when speaking of knights, one speaks of the people’s hopes. Courage and wisdom lead, forming the blade’s edge. Purity and integrity follow, forming the guard. Worthiness leans upon it as the spine. Loyalty and sagacity root it as the tang. Eminence is what one grasps and enacts, forming the hilt. In governing a state, observing whether these—edge, guard, tang, and hilt—are harmonized reveals the weapon’s efficacy and the state’s stability or peril.

Though the realm and a single state differ in scale, their employment relies on the movement of spirit, which is one and the same. As for the commoner’s sword, it directly addresses the king’s misguided preference to correct his error. That the swordsmen all submitted and died in their places demonstrates how to overcome rigidity and strength—nothing more.

Yi Du’s commentary: What people deeply cherish, external things cannot wrest away. How much more so for one who stands above others, wielding power with an arrogant heart, whose words cannot penetrate and whose nature cannot be transformed? Thus, when King Wen of Zhao favored swords, Zhuangzi presented himself as a swordsman, seizing upon his preference to embed deeper meaning. Expounding the Way of heaven and humanity, he delineated the affairs of the Son of Heaven, feudal lords, and commoners to move him. In doing so, he succeeded in curbing King Wen’s obsession with swords.

The Son of Heaven’s sword must take neighboring states and the perils of mountains and seas as its edge, guard, tang, and hilt, encircling and binding them. Its regulation is based on the five phases, punishments, and virtues; its application follows yin and yang and the four seasons. Thus, it meets no resistance, moves without obstruction, cleaves the floating clouds above, and severs the earth’s bounds below. Who but the most divine under heaven could achieve this?

In discussing the feudal lords’ sword, one relies on governance through people, employing courage, wisdom, purity, integrity, loyalty, sagacity, and eminence as edge, guard, tang, and hilt. Wielded thus, it strikes like thunder, leaving none unsubdued. As for the commoner’s sword, the answer lies in the king’s present preference—no different from a fighting cock, exhausting its qi and strength to die. This illustrates that petty techniques are insufficient for governing a state. This aligns with Mencius’ response to King Xuan of Qi’s fondness for courage.

Upon hearing these words, the king felt shame and remorse, circling his meal without daring to eat his fill. Thereupon, he did not leave his palace for three months, and the swordsmen all submitted, dying in their places—proof that he had heard Zhuangzi’s words and repented.

Bi Xu’s commentary: The one who wages war in the ancestral temple is an emperor; the one who transforms through spirit is a king. Temple warfare models itself on heaven and earth; spiritual transformation models itself on the four seasons. Thus, when governance is refined within the borders, distant lands admire its virtue; when victory is secured before battle, feudal lords submit to its might. To wield all under heaven as a sword—how could it be compared to mere Tai’e or Ganjiang?

King Wen of Zhao’s fondness for swords and disdain for officials aimed to advance the principle of divine martiality without killing. Of old, there was a treasured sword named Han Guang—"Containing Light." Invisible to the eye, unfelt to the touch, its shadow showed no curve, its sound no clarity. Housed in the ancestral temple, it awed the four barbarians; employed in enemy lands, a single child wielding it could repel three armies.

Yet when revealed as emptiness within, opened to external vastness, moved without form, and unleashed without action, it advanced and retreated with the dance of phoenixes and the flourish of dragons. What need was there for measuring length, comparing speed, striking waists and necks, or endlessly severing and slaying? For arms are inauspicious instruments, used by the sage only when unavoidable.

The sword is the courage of a single man, akin to a fighting cock—once its life is spent, what use is it to a state of ten thousand chariots?

Liu Chao’s commentary: In the nature of all things under heaven, none do not despise the different and revere the same, discard the small and admire the great, even to the point of pursuing harm for the sake of profit—this is often the case. If something does not align with oneself, even if beneficial, it is not followed; if no benefit is perceived, even if great, it is not admired.

Zhuangzi’s discourse on the Way, including this passage on the words of persuaders and rhetoricians, embeds profound principles in subtle expressions, necessarily conveyed through language. Human nature exalts itself and devalues others, justifies itself and condemns others. To seek unity among those with differing kindling would even humble Confucius before the violence of a bandit. Yet by aligning with what is shared, Zhuangzi’s single utterance severed King Wen of Zhao’s lifelong obsession—such is the principle.

As for the disheveled topknots, drooping caps, flowing beards, short robes, glaring eyes, and contentious speech—these were King Wen’s preferences, not Zhuangzi’s true nature.

Now, should one alter one’s usual disposition and change one’s customary attire, the listener will revere what is said. To discourse first on the Son of Heaven, then on the feudal lords, and last on the common folk is to evoke admiration for what is grand. Grandeur commands the realm; next, it wins the homage of the four borders; at the lowest, it severs necks—thus does one approach what is profitable. The nature of affairs does not extend beyond this. The sage harmonizes and responds, nurturing things as they are, so that even the multitude of monkeys submit to the morning-four-evening-three stratagem—how could this lack its own principle?

Yet to bend oneself without ever straightening another is to make Zhuangzi’s discourse on the sword seem like mere compliance. Moreover, the Robber Zhi and the Fisherman are not his true concerns. The general purport of his words is mutual attack, though the underlying principle is subtle indeed. If one traces the surface to seek meaning, how can one grasp the speaker’s intent?

Yanjuan notes: *Drooping cap* means not raising the cap high, like the headscarf of a stalwart knight. *Flowing beard* signifies coarseness. *Short robe* means it does not drape fully. *Contentious speech* refers to verbal disputation. To display emptiness and open with profit is to advance; to strike from behind or arrive first is to attack with concealed force. *Dun* means to sever, as when swords clash and cut. *Xin* is the sword’s edge; *jia* is its hilt. The four seasons, five phases, sun, moon, yin, and yang all follow the natural workings of creation. Above, they float like clouds; below, they sever the earth’s foundations—such is the vastness of their application. Thrice circling the land of one’s sustenance without daring to sit, one feels shame and cannot rest. Once the king was moved and abandoned this frivolous pursuit, the swordsmen all withdrew and perished in their dwellings.

Master Chu’s general discussion states: The *Nanhua* establishes its words to clarify the Dao, soaring above the nine heavens and delving into the nine earths, opening and closing creation, unfathomable even to spirits and gods. Yet when it draws on things as metaphors, it does not stray from the discourse of the human world, while profound subtleties lie concealed within, sufficient to awaken hearts and remedy the ills of the age. The *Discourse on the Sword* is a piece of mighty rhetoric with a subtle purpose, its resonance enduring for millennia—how could it be mere idle sound?

The *Han History* records that the Sima family of Zhao gained renown through their transmission of swordsmanship, so the art of the sword has flourished since ancient times. Thus did the Master of Painted Bamboo seize upon it to express the marvels within his breast. Some, clinging to superficial resemblance, mistake it for the rhetoric of itinerant persuaders, thereby missing the essence of the classic and confusing luminous pearls with fish eyes.

Boshi, in his humble estimation, has examined the intent behind the *Nanhua*’s words and offers this explanation: The state of Zhao is a metaphor for the individual; King Wen’s fondness for the sword is an allegory for the heart ensnared by desire. The crown prince’s grief is like a glimmer of awareness that cannot restrain the heart’s failings. Seeking Zhuangzi to curb the king’s obsession is akin to overcoming it through reason. The three swords presented illustrate the varying degrees of principle, and the discerning eye will perceive their distinctions.

"One man in ten paces"—none can withstand its edge. "A thousand *li* without pause"—its use is swift and decisive. This resembles one who preserves the wholeness of spirit. The Son of Heaven relies on neighboring states for defense, feudal lords on worthy scholars for support, and commoners on the courage of the individual. For the King of Zhao, in his exalted position, to favor the sword of the commoner is to obscure the supreme nobility of virtue and pursue the basest of desires. To have swordsmen clash before him day and night—how can one ensure it does not become like the fable of the cock that harmed the state? Such degradation is extreme.

To remedy this failing and restore his original nature, nothing but the highest principle will suffice. When principle prevails and desire dissipates, what remains is the true nature, and the poisoned blade is transformed into a sacred vessel—then the heart has no further use. This is to recover what was lost, though not without difficulty, and is called acting through effort, yet the success is the same.

The three swords of the Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, and the commoners represent the varying depths of nature, the heights of aspiration, and the degrees of accomplishment. The ancient rulers who governed the realm with divine martial prowess yet without killing all wielded this sword, employing its spirit—how could mere Tai’e or Ganjiang compare?

Thus, the King of Zhao circled his table without tending to his nourishment, for ritual and propriety delighted his heart, and even fine meats seemed insufficient. Once the king sat calmly and composed his breath, the matter of the sword was resolved—this shows how the heart is harmed by movement and the nature is attained through stillness. To recover one’s nature is to return to one’s original truth, which is also to attain nothing at all.

When the King of Zhao did not leave his palace for three months, he was able to preserve stillness, cultivate emptiness, and maintain his nature unchanged. The swordsmen all perished where they stood, for this is a metaphor for the immediate death of the heart. When the craftsman departs, the harmony of the craft ceases; looking back, even the so-called sacred vessel is transformed along with it—what distinction then remains between Son of Heaven and commoner?

To accede to the crown prince’s request and decline his gifts is akin to Lu Zhonglian’s preservation of Handan without accepting a thousand gold—both are acts of righteousness. In the end, he curbed the King of Zhao’s frivolous obsession and stabilized his state, embedding the principles of governance within while not abandoning them.

The *Nanhua* grieves for those in the world who are mired in desire, losing their nature without realizing it, and thus composes this discourse to show that restoring one’s nature depends on inner mastery, guarding against desire like a double-edged sword. The moment the heart stirs, one must overcome it with reason, rather than waiting for swordsmen to clash at the gates day and night before seeking a skilled persuader to intervene.

This is the Dao concealed within a craft, expounded through words to resolve doubts. Yet those who seek correspondence in external forms risk obscuring the grand principles for ages, even confining the profoundest teachings to the pen of the pedant—how lamentable! Through exhaustive inquiry, one may awaken, return to the source, and perhaps align with the original intent of the text.

Zixuan, in his study of this classic, grasped its essence. His mighty prose and profound arguments vie with it, yet for this chapter alone he appended not a single word, allowing readers to delve deeply and attain understanding on their own.

Lest some should harbor doubts on this point, it is necessary to clarify.

*End of Scroll Ninety-Seven of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei
*Scroll Ninety-Eight of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Yi Hai Zuan Wei
*Compiled by the Daoist Priest Chu Boxiu of Wulin*

**The Fisherman, First Chapter**

Confucius wandered through the dark-canopied forest and rested, seated upon the Apricot Altar. His disciples were reciting the *Book of Documents*, while Confucius accompanied them with zither song, the melody not yet half-finished. A fisherman descended from his boat and approached, his temples and brows snowy white, hair unbound, sleeves of elm-cloth fluttering. He strode up from the marshland, halted at the shore, his left hand resting on his knee, his right supporting his chin, listening.

When the song ended, he beckoned to Zigong and Zilu, who both stepped forward. The stranger pointed at Confucius and asked, “What is that man doing?”

Zilu replied, “He is a gentleman of Lu.”

The stranger inquired about his lineage.

“His lineage is the Kong clan.”

“And what does the Kong clan govern?”

Zilu did not answer, but Zigong replied, “The Kong clan cultivates loyalty and trust in nature, practices benevolence and righteousness in conduct, refines ritual and music, and selects proper human relations. Above, they serve the rulers of the age with devotion; below, they transform the common people. They aim to benefit all under Heaven—this is what the Kong clan governs.”

The stranger asked further, “Is he a lord with lands?”

“No,” Zigong said.

“Is he an advisor to kings and lords?”
“No, he is not.”

The stranger laughed and turned away, saying as he walked, “Benevolent, yes, but I fear he will not preserve himself. His heart toils and his form labors, endangering his true nature. Alas, how far removed he is from the Dao!”

Zigong returned and reported to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and rose, saying, “Could he be a sage?” He went in search of the man and found him by the marsh, just as he was using a staff to pull his boat. The stranger turned, saw Confucius, and stood facing him. Confucius retreated, bowed twice, and stepped forward.

The stranger asked, “What do you seek?”

Confucius replied, “A short while ago, Master left with words unfinished. I, Qiu, am unworthy and did not grasp their meaning. I humbly awaited in your wake, hoping to hear even the sound of your cough or spit to complete my understanding.”

The stranger said, “Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!”

Confucius said, “From my youth I have cultivated learning, and now I am sixty-nine years old. Yet I have never heard the ultimate teaching—how could I not empty my heart?”

The stranger said, “Like attracts like, and sound responds to sound—this is the principle of Heaven. Let me set aside what I possess and expound what you possess. What you possess pertains to human affairs. When the Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, the great officers, and the common people each rectify themselves, governance is at its finest. When these four abandon their stations, no disorder could be greater. When offices fulfill their duties and each person attends to their affairs, none will overstep. Thus:
- Fields lie fallow, homes stand exposed, clothing and food are insufficient, taxes are unpaid, wives and concubines are at odds, and elders and juniors lack order—these are the worries of the common people.
- Incompetence, official duties left undone, conduct that is not pure, subordinates who are negligent, achievements unrecognized, and ranks and emoluments unsustained—these are the worries of the great officers.
- The court lacks loyal ministers, the state is benighted and disordered, craftsmen lack skill, tribute is unworthy, seasonal rites fall behind, and the Son of Heaven is disobeyed—these are the worries of the feudal lords.
- Yin and yang are not in harmony, harming the myriad things; feudal lords are violent and disorderly, harming the people; ritual and music lack moderation, resources are exhausted, human relations are unordered, and the hundred clans are licentious—these are the worries of the Son of Heaven’s ministers.

Now you, above, have no authority of lord or minister, and below, no office of great officer, yet you presumptuously refine ritual and music, select proper human relations, and seek to transform the common people. Is this not excessively meddlesome?

Moreover, people have eight flaws, and affairs have four perils—these must not go unexamined.

To take up what is not your affair is called *overreaching*;
To advance where none heeds you is called *obsequiousness*;
To guide speech by another’s wishes is called *flattery*;
To speak without discerning right or wrong is called *sycophancy*;
To delight in speaking ill of others is called *slander*;
To sever friendships and estrange kin is called *treachery*;
To praise falsely and deceive, leading others to ruin, is called *depravity*;
To fail to distinguish good from bad, to please both sides, and to stealthily seize what you desire is called *perfidy*.

These eight flaws bring chaos to others and harm to oneself. The noble person does not befriend such a one, nor does the enlightened ruler employ them.

The four perils are these:
To love managing great affairs, altering and changing the constant, all for the sake of hanging one’s name on achievements, is called *presumptuousness*;
To monopolize knowledge, arrogate affairs, and act without restraint is called *greed*;
To see one’s faults yet not change, and to heed admonitions with greater obstinacy, is called *obduracy*;
To approve only what accords with oneself, and to reject even what is good if it does not, is called *arrogance*.

These are the four perils. Only when you have cast off the eight flaws and do not practice the four perils can you begin to be taught.”

Confucius sighed deeply and said, “I, Qiu, was twice driven from Lu, my footprints erased in Wei, my tree felled in Song, and I was besieged in Chen and Cai. I do not know what I have done wrong to incur these four slanders.”

The stranger said, “How difficult it is for you to awaken!”

There was a man who loathed his shadow and detested his footprints, so he ran to flee them. The more he lifted his feet, the more prints appeared; the faster he ran, the more his shadow clung to him. Believing himself still too slow, he ran without cease until his strength gave out and he died. He did not know that by standing in the shade he could rest his shadow, and by remaining still he could still his traces—how foolish he was!

You scrutinize the space between benevolence and righteousness, examine the boundary between sameness and difference, observe the changes of movement and stillness, adjust the measure of giving and receiving, order the passions of liking and disliking, and harmonize the rhythms of joy and anger—yet you are perilously close to not escaping [such folly]! If you diligently cultivate yourself, guard your true nature, and return things to others, you will have no encumbrances. Now, if you do not cultivate yourself but seek [perfection] in others, is this not misplaced?

Confucius, looking solemn, said, “May I ask what is meant by *the true*?”
The stranger replied, “The true is the utmost of essence and sincerity. Without essence and sincerity, one cannot move others. Thus, forced weeping, though sorrowful, is not mournful; forced anger, though stern, is not awe-inspiring; forced affection, though smiling, is not harmonious. True sorrow is mournful without sound; true anger is awe-inspiring before it erupts; true affection is harmonious before it smiles. When the true resides within, the spirit moves without—this is why the true is prized.

Applied to human affairs, it manifests thus: in serving parents, one is naturally filial; in serving a lord, one is loyal and steadfast; in drinking wine, one is joyful; in mourning, one is grieved. Loyalty and steadfastness take merit as their essence; drinking wine takes joy as its essence; mourning takes sorrow as its essence; serving parents takes comfort as its essence. When merit is perfected, none of its bounds are missed. In serving parents with comfort, one does not debate the means; in drinking wine with joy, one does not select the vessels; in mourning with sorrow, one does not question the rites.

Rites are what the common world practices; the true is what one receives from Heaven, naturally and unalterably. Thus, the sage models Heaven and values the true, not constrained by custom. The foolish do the opposite: they cannot model Heaven but fret over others, do not prize the true, and drift along, shaped by custom—how pitiable! You were early steeped in human artifice and late to hear the great Dao!”

Confucius said, “Today I have met you as if by Heaven’s favor. You do not disdain to liken me to a servant, yet you teach me in person. May I ask where you dwell? I wish to follow and complete my study of the great Dao.”

The stranger said, “I have heard: those who can be led may be guided to the subtle Dao; those who cannot be led do not understand the Dao—beware of leading them, lest you incur blame. Strive on!” He then poled his boat away, vanishing among the green reeds.

Yan Yuan turned the carriage, and Zilu handed Confucius the reins, but Confucius did not look back. He waited until the water’s ripples stilled and the sound of the pole was no longer heard before daring to board. Zilu, standing beside the carriage, asked, “I have served you for a long time, yet never have I seen you meet someone with such reverence. Even rulers of ten thousand chariots or lords of a thousand chariots, when they meet you, do not fail to accord you equal courtesy—yet you still bear a haughty demeanor. Now, this old fisherman, leaning on his pole and standing upright, and you bending at the waist, bowing repeatedly in response—was this not excessive? The disciples all find your conduct strange. How did the fisherman deserve this?”

Confucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed, “How difficult it is to transform you, You! You have been steeped in ritual and righteousness for so long, yet your crude and vulgar heart remains. Come closer, I will tell you. To meet an elder without respect is a breach of ritual; to meet a worthy without reverence is a lack of benevolence. If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself before others. If one does not humble oneself with precision, one cannot attain the true—and thus one harms oneself. Alas, the lack of benevolence in others is no greater misfortune, yet you alone cling to it!

Moreover, the Dao is the path by which the myriad things proceed. Those who lose it die; those who attain it live. In affairs, to go against it is to fail; to follow it is to succeed. Thus, wherever the Dao resides, the sage reveres it. This old fisherman possesses the Dao—how could I not revere him?”

Zhuangzi employed allegory not to condemn Confucius’ teachings, but to show that from the Son of Heaven to the common people, each has its proper order. His critique of flaws and maladies strikes precisely at the heart of affairs. Yet when Confucius said that at sixty-nine he had gained nothing, was it not because he had not yet attained the freedom of following the heart? For once one follows the heart, then donning benevolence and righteousness, practicing loyalty and trust, adorning ritual and music, and selecting human relationships—all means by which the world is governed—are no longer genuine. It is like mistaking the finger for the moon; the finger is not the moon.

Did Confucius, upon reaching this realization, have nothing left to do? Even receiving instruction from the Fisherman could not be uttered aloud, hence the words: *“I depart from you! I depart from you!”*—both to be forgotten in wordless silence.

**Bi Xu’s Annotation:** When the four classes of people adhere to their proper vocations, they are not swayed by worldly profit. Affairs respond to what they encounter, thus they abound in sufficiency and know no sorrow. Those of small ambition harbor no grand designs; those who lose control of their methods fail to establish merit and cannot preserve their emoluments. Schemes that miss the mark, words that lack sincerity, excessive labor leading to shoddy work, exorbitant demands resulting in poor tribute—these violate the Dao and breed resentment. Thus, delays invite disaster, changes to what is fitting disrupt harmony, alterations to constants harm things, deep anger sparks violence, extreme indignation provokes plunder, excessive ritual and music lead to licentiousness, and heavy taxes bring destitution. Yet if one reflects and cultivates these, flaws and maladies may be avoided!

To travel through the various states and wish to avoid slander is like racing through dust hoping one’s robes remain unstained, or braving rain wishing one’s headscarf stays dry. Let things return to things, let people return to people. Cultivate the self and preserve the true—neither self nor other will be burdened.

The true is the nature of spontaneity, inwardly arising from sincerity and outwardly resonating with Heaven and humanity. In its application to human principles, loyalty, filial piety, sorrow, and joy each finds its proper place. The beauty of accomplishment leaves no trace. Ritual is the teaching of the world; the true is the nature of Heaven. The foolish are anxious about others and swayed by custom, thus they fall short of the Dao.

The Fisherman’s Way is uncontrived and uncalculating, serene and desireless, yet all excellences follow from it—this is why Confucius returned to revere him.

**Liu Chao’s Annotation:** What aligns with oneself is deemed right, hence the King of Zhao regarded Zhuangzi as worthy. What differs from oneself is deemed wrong, hence Robber Zhi reviled Confucius as a thief. Without alignment or opposition, only where the Dao resides will I offer my utmost respect and speak fully—this is why the *Fisherman* chapter was composed and why Confucius was chosen for the allegory.

The spontaneity of Heaven and human principles are far apart, yet their roots and branches, their beginnings and ends, have never been mutually abolished. When the true is accumulated within, the spirit moves without, while the functions of penal codes, names, rituals, and laws are but its outer manifestations. Confucius clarified the cessation of anxiety and its causes, aligning with the people to benefit those in the world who guard the true. Moreover, governance values cherishing the self. As Laozi once said: *“Only one who cherishes the self as the world can be entrusted with the world.”* Thus, the art of benefiting the world inherently includes governing by non-governance. This is what Confucius embraced.

As for Chang Ju and Jie Ni, who preserved their purity while disrupting human relationships, Confucius never failed to decline and avoid them. From this, we know the intent behind the allegory has its proper place.

**Juan Zhai’s Annotation:** After the Spring and Autumn period, the order of court visits was lost. Praise became deceitful and false, lauding what ought not be lauded. Evil was condemned in those who did not deserve condemnation.

To adapt one’s countenance to another’s preferences is called "facial accommodation," wherein neither good nor evil is distinguished—all is done to please. To accommodate both sides is called "dual accommodation."

The Eight Blemishes and Four Afflictions are the great sighs of humanity; only by shedding these can one speak of the Dao. The Fisherman remarked that all the Master’s deeds were done for others, which is why he could not escape worldly slander. If one cultivates the self and guards the true, with no opposition between self and other, then nothing will encumber one. Now, if one does not seek within but busily strives for others, is this not externalizing the self?

Without utmost sincerity, one cannot move others—this is the meaning of "sincerity even moving spirits." The six lines on forced weeping, forced laughter, forced affection, and their genuine counterparts are most incisive. What is true within moves the spirit without.

Rites are embellishments of externals, the doings of worldly custom. The true is the principle of Heaven’s mandate and natural spontaneity. Those who do not know the nobility of Heaven’s nobility take worldly emoluments as their reward, willingly transformed by vulgar currents, and thus appear perpetually dissatisfied.

Those who do not refine themselves cannot attain the true—this is further instruction for scholars. The Fisherman was a man of the Dao, and I revere his Way, which is why I honor him.

**Chu’s Narrow View:** Some say the Fisherman was Fan Li in his five-lake skiff or the one Qu Yuan encountered by the marsh. Yet I believe one need not fixate on his identity. Rather, he represents those who conceal their virtue and hide their brilliance, dwelling in lakes and seas—like Jiang Taigong, Yan Ziling, Zhang Zhihe, or Lu Guimeng. Among them are those who concealed even their names; how could all be exhaustively traced?

"Black curtains" refers to dense forests dark as draperies, hence the name. In the *Nanhua*, the Fisherman’s dialogue with Confucius and the Madman of Chu’s song passing by Confucius share the same intent. Confucius was earnest in his care for others, so his worldly traces became conspicuous, allowing people to speculate about him. Thus, the Fisherman admonished him to shed blemishes, distance himself from harm, cultivate the self, guard the true, and return things to others.

Fame, too, is a thing. The Creator is sparing with it, and excess invites envy. The true is the noble treasure within; no external thing can compare. If one does not value the true, the inner self lacks a foundation, and one drifts, readily transformed by custom—no wonder.

The metaphors of fearing one’s shadow and hating one’s tracks, along with the two analogies of forced weeping and forced anger, are most precise. The passage on serving parents with kindness and filial piety offers great benefit to the art of governance, showing that the Fisherman was not merely one who perfected himself but acted with timely restraint.

Upon hearing these words, Confucius awakened, wishing to abandon his learning and ultimately receive the teaching. Those who govern the world through action, upon hearing the benefits of non-action, cannot but revere it. The Fisherman poled his boat away, demonstrating that having transformed others, he left no lingering trace. Only after the water’s waves stilled and the sound of his oar vanished did Confucius dare to board—having heard the ultimate words, his heart was joyfully and sincerely convinced. Though the man had departed, reverence remained.

All the Fisherman’s words clarify that the world’s understanding of Confucius extended only so far as his worldly advancement. Only the *Nanhua* grasped the Master’s heart, pointing to his traces yet criticizing them—thus the true could be silently apprehended.

Many fault this *Classic* for disparaging Confucius. I say that the *Nanhua* alone grasped the subtlety of how to honor him. Words that seem contrary are in fact upright—this is precisely the meaning.

*Collected Subtleties of the Ocean of Meanings in the True Classic of Nanhua*, Scroll 98, concludes.

**#1** The *Omissions and Errors* cites Zhang Junfang’s edition, where the character *è* (恶, "evil") appears as *dé* (德, "virtue").
**#2** The character *bā* (八, "eight") is a scribal error for *rén* (人, "person").

Lie Yukou, Chapter One

Lie Yukou was traveling to Qi when he turned back midway and encountered Bohun Maoren. Bohun Maoren asked: "Why have you returned?"

Liezi replied: "I was startled."

"By what?"

"I once took meals at ten millet-porridge stalls, and five of them served me first."

Bohun Maoren said: "If that is so, why were you startled?"

Liezi answered: "When inner sincerity is not dissolved, the body’s demeanor radiates brilliance, which externally overawes others’ hearts, causing them to slight the noble and the aged and to disregard their own concerns. Those porridge-sellers merely traffic in food and broth. Though my surplus was slight, the profit they sought was meager, and their leverage was light—yet even they acted thus. How much more so a lord of ten thousand chariots! He would exhaust himself for the state and expend his knowledge on affairs, then entrust me with tasks and demand results from me. That is why I was startled."

Bohun Maoren said: "Excellent observation! Now that you have settled yourself, others will safeguard you."

Shortly after, Liezi went to visit, and the sandals outside the door filled the entrance. Bohun Maoren stood facing north, leaning heavily on his staff and pressing it against his chin. After standing for a while, he departed without a word. The attendant informed Liezi, who grabbed his sandals and ran barefoot to the gate, saying: "Master, since you have come, will you not prescribe a remedy?"

Bohun Maoren replied: "Enough! I had already told you that others would safeguard you—and indeed, they have."

You cannot make others safeguard you, nor can you prevent them from safeguarding you—why then this pretense of surprise and delight in standing out? If you must provoke a response, you disturb your fundamental nature, and all for nothing. None of those who accompany you will tell you this: their petty words are all poison to men. Unawakened, uncomprehending—how could they discern the truth?

The cunning toil and the wise fret, while the incapable seek nothing. They eat and wander freely, drifting like an untethered boat, empty and roaming. (Guo’s note: "Jiang" refers to the households that sell broth. "First to offer gifts" speaks of their reverence for you. If one’s inner self is unresolved, one will outwardly feign dignity. Their every movement is calculated to create an imposing presence, yet this only overawes others while their inner substance remains insufficient to command true respect. If authority arose from inner substance, it would deepen others’ reverence for the aged. But when one moves others with superficial beauty, the trouble of disorder arises. The broth-seller’s influence is slight and their profit meager—they need seek nothing from others. If one does not neglect their own form, they will be safeguarded wherever they go. "Safeguarded" means to be gathered and protected. If one acts with impartiality and transforms through natural influence, there will be no provocation, no seeking; without provocation or seeking, there will be no mutual safeguarding. To bestow favors before others act is to offer kindness not rooted in them—this pretense of standing out is the very cause of provocation. If provocation is inevitable, it will disturb one’s fundamental nature. Petty cleverness infiltrates others through trivial words. Only the sage is truly without ability. From this point downward, even to the insects, none forget their own abilities to rely on the multitude. (Lü’s note: The sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within, preserving their form and life. Their concealment of self is never too deep or remote. If inner sincerity is unresolved, one cannot forget the heart. When sincerity manifests in form, it creates a radiance that can be scrutinized, revealing that this is not the way to conceal oneself. Eating at ten broth-stalls, half of them offering gifts first—this is using externals to overawe others’ hearts, making them slight the noble and aged while prizing oneself, thus inviting chaos and self-inflicted harm. "Ji" is interchangeable with "ji." Only by responding after being provoked, embracing one’s nature and holding fast to spirit while navigating the world, can one prevent others from safeguarding them. Standing out reveals one’s hidden motives; pretense of delight disturbs one’s fundamental nature. This is the great peril of nurturing the heart and preserving spirit. Thus, those who do not warn you but speak petty words are the ones to be scrutinized—such is the need that steams and matures into completion.

The learner daily accumulates; thus, they eat without seeking fullness and dwell without seeking comfort. The Daoist daily diminishes, shedding knowledge and cunning to return to incapability. Thus, they drift like an untethered boat, empty and roaming. (Yi Du’s note: Unable to achieve inner liberation, one manifests externals to create radiance. "Die" implies close scrutiny. Unable to inwardly conceal their virtue, they rely on external displays to impress, causing others to chase appearances and slight the noble and aged. "Man" describes the fragmented and chaotic state of things—when virtue has not reached profound liberation, and the heart of scrutiny manifests outwardly, chaos arises from it. Even the broth-seller, with meager profit and slight influence, still competes to flock to you—how much more so a lord of ten thousand chariots, who exhausts himself for the state and expends his knowledge on affairs, seeking worthy assistance and demanding results? This is why you were startled. "Excellent observation!"—this is not merely seeing others but also reflecting inwardly.)

When paying respects to one’s elders, one removes their shoes before ascending the hall. Shoes fill the doorway outside—this shows many seek to return to you, truly making you one whom others rely upon. "Dispensing medicine" refers to offering good words to teach others, like medicine curing illness. Though Liezi could fully realize his nature, he had not yet reached the realm of destiny, nor could he abandon form and erase boundaries—thus, others still relied upon him. It was not that Liezi made them rely on him, but that he could not prevent others from doing so. As the scripture says, "It is difficult to make the world entirely forget me"—this is precisely the case.

When both self and things are forgotten, one responds when things stir. Yet if you display extraordinary traces to provoke their approach, you will inevitably invite their influence. This will disturb your fundamental nature, allowing external things to enter and mingle with you. Those who follow you will offer no true counsel but instead deceive you with flattery—this is human poison. If you cannot awaken from your delusion, how can you discern rightly? *Shu* means "to know." To know one another is to become familiar. The clever and knowing cannot escape worry and toil. Without cleverness or knowledge, one remains incapable yet eats their fill and roams freely, drifting like an untethered boat.

The *Bixu Annotation* states: When inner sincerity remains unresolved and the heart is not empty, the scrutiny of form creates radiance—this is the affair of demeanor. By outwardly overawing others’ hearts, one makes them revere one’s brilliance. They slight the noble and aged while honoring me, fearing the chaos that may arise. Though the profit is meager, they treat me thus—how much more so a lord of ten thousand chariots? If the ruler values worthiness, the burden of responsibility will not be light—this is why you were startled.

Shoes fill the doorway outside—people truly rely upon and attach themselves to you. Offering earnest instruction is like a physician dispensing medicine. Where traces exist, people will rely upon you; without intent, none will know you. Liezi could preserve his virtue but had not yet made it free and unbound. Responding to things with delight and displaying traces of distinction disturbs your fundamental nature—how can this be endured? Those who follow you are all beneath you; no loyal warnings are heeded, only cunning and poison. Who can clearly perceive this and admonish you?

Moreover, people come to rely on you not to seek non-action but to learn cleverness and knowledge—only the sage understands this. Thus, with an empty heart and no attachments, entrusting all to the multitude, one remains free from toil and worry, eating their fill and roaming at will.

*Juanji* says: When sincerity accumulates within but has not yet transformed, the movements of form and appearance create radiance—this is why others respect you. Zhaozhou said: "This old monk’s cultivation lacks power; he has been seen through by ghosts and spirits"—this is the meaning. The noble and aged are those whom people should respect, yet now they slight them and honor me instead. *Ji* means "to gather," for the more one’s traces are exposed, the less one can escape the troubles of the age. If even a broth-seller treats me with such reverence, how much more a ruler? The ruler exhausts himself in labor and depletes his knowledge, inevitably seeking my service to achieve success—this is the very gathering of troubles. People will turn to you and rely upon you as their teacher—this sense of "reliance" already carries insufficiency. Observe how others’ perceptions are but a fleeting glimpse, yet yours are a step higher.

In ancient times, when sitting on mats, one would remove their shoes before entering. If eager to welcome a guest, one might not have time to put on shoes and would rush out carrying them. If you cannot prevent others from relying on you, this is the difficulty of making them forget you. Why do you do this? What has brought you to this point?

The people are so moved, delighted, and overjoyed that you cannot conceal yourself—your eccentricities manifest outwardly, and this will disturb your fundamental nature, to no benefit. Moreover, none of your friends admonish or correct you, so you will remain unaware for life, and who will ever question your conduct?

The clever exhaust themselves with labor, the wise inevitably suffer, but only those who embody the Dao and act naturally, without employing their abilities, may eat their fill and wander carefree. This passage culminates in the word "emptiness"—truly a marvelous stroke.

This entire chapter appears in the *Liezi*. There are only three or four differing characters between the versions. *Nanhua* adds the lines beginning with "the clever" to summarize the preceding meaning, making it even more brilliant, like Guo Ziyi taking command of Li Guangbi’s army.

According to the *Liezi*, Lie Yukou lived in the gardens of Zheng for forty years without being recognized. Thus, the five broth-sellers’ prior offerings must have occurred before his time in Zheng. Yet to be startled by a broth-seller’s gift reveals a subtle scrutiny of others and self-examination. When shoes fill the doorway, it shows one cannot conceal their presence. If people vie to flock to and rely upon you, why employ this path of delighting and astonishing others?

All who seek to move others must first unsettle their fundamental nature; only then can they be transformed—what more is there to say? If I remain without intent, even spirits cannot fathom me, let alone people. Yet none of your friends warn you, and you, indulging in clever flattery, remain oblivious—how have you grown so accustomed to this?

In ancient texts, *shú* (熟) and *shú* (孰) were interchangeable. Those who vie to apply cleverness and knowledge labor and worry, with none content to rest in inability—this "inability" is akin to "non-action." Through non-action, one seeks no more than a full belly and carefree wandering, drifting like an untethered boat—nothing more than emptiness.

The *Bixu* edition of the *Liezi* reads "without excess gain." The man of Zheng, Huan, groaned in the land of Qiu. After three years, Huan became a Confucian. His influence extended like a river moistening nine *li*, benefiting three clans, and he taught his younger brother Mo. When Confucians and Mohists debated, their father sided with Mo. After ten years, Huan took his own life. In a dream, his father said: "It was I who made your son a Mohist." When Hu once examined his mulberry, it had become the fruit of the catalpa.

The Creator’s retribution does not punish the person but the person’s Heaven. It was Heaven that made him so. People, believing themselves exceptional, despise their kin. The well-drinkers of Qi quarreled over it. Thus, it is said: "In this age, all are like Huan."

From this, those with virtue do not know, let alone those with the Dao. The ancients called this "fleeing from Heaven’s form." The sage finds peace in what is naturally peaceful and does not seek peace in what is not; the multitude seeks peace in what is not peaceful and does not find peace in what is. Guo’s commentary: Mo was Huan’s younger brother. Huan, resenting his father’s aid to his brother, was so moved that he took his own life. In death, he appeared in a dream, saying he had become a Confucian and transformed his brother into a Mohist. Yet his brother, though influenced by him, did not regard him as a worthy teacher, leading to his resentment even in death. Such was the depth of his sincerity that he became the fruit of the catalpa.

The passage beginning with "the Creator" is Zhuangzi’s own words. The power of accumulated habit is the retribution—it repays one’s nature, not one’s actions. Thus, the work of study and practice perfects one’s nature; it is not for the sake of action. Each has their own nature, so each is made to cultivate accordingly. Huan prided himself on his Confucianism, believing in his accumulated learning, unaware of its naturalness.

Those who possess merit and despise others do not spare even their kin; those who act without self-interest treat high and low without losing proper order. Digging a well draws forth the spring; chanting and singing open the nature. Without a spring, there is nothing to dig; without nature, there is nothing to chant. The world forgets the naturalness of springs and nature, fixating only on the superficial work of digging and chanting, taking pride in possession—is this not delusion?

Observe Huan’s folly in taking learning as his path. His father allowed him to follow his own way, knowing there was nothing to be done. To claim natural ability as one’s own merit is to flee from Heaven—thus punishment befalls them. The sage neither clings to nor rejects peace, following the hearts of the people in what they find peaceful. Their divergence is what makes them part of the multitude.

Lü’s commentary: Huan became a Confucian and made his brother a Mohist, leading to their debates. Their father sided with Mo, and Huan took his own life—all the result of their own actions. Yet Huan’s Confucianism and Mo’s Mohism were their Heaven-given natures. Judging by their actions, father and sons, brothers, Confucians and Mohists were not of one body or occupation. Judging by their Heaven-given natures, they were one and the same. What the father dreamed was Huan’s Heaven—Huan’s Heaven was also his brother’s Heaven, yet Huan did not recognize himself. It was Heaven that made his brother a Mohist.

What is received from nature cannot be learned—it is merely Heaven. If his brother became a Mohist, and Huan believed his own Heaven was superior, he forgot the bonds of father, son, and brother. To study Confucianism and become a Confucian, or to study Mohism and become a Mohist, like Huan becoming the fruit of the catalpa—all are the Creator’s retribution, Heaven’s doing. Yet people do not understand what makes them aid others; they believe themselves exceptional, even despising their kin, as Huan did—how tragic!

This is no different from the people of Qi fighting over a well they claimed as their own. Those in the world who do not know their Heaven and despise others while exalting themselves are all like Huan. The root of such loss of nature lies in possessing knowledge. Those with virtue preserve their Heaven through not-knowing—how much more so those with the Dao?

Those with knowledge flee from Heaven; fleeing from Heaven and doubling back on true nature cannot escape reversion—thus the ancients called this "the punishment of fleeing Heaven." The sage finds peace in what is naturally peaceful, while the multitude finds peace in what is not. What is peaceful is Heaven; what is not peaceful is man.

*Dú’s Annotation*: "Groans and recitations"—the sounds of chanting.
*Qiú’s Land*—a place name.

For Confucians to achieve renown, they must master the unity of Heaven, Earth, and man before resting. Those who chant for three years to attain it grasp only the coarse. Even in that era, a thorough Confucian like Huan was hard to find—yet Zheng employed him. "River’s moisture" is a metaphor for far-reaching beneficence. "Three clans" refers to father, mother, and wife.

Huan became a Confucian, his brother a Mohist—each expanded what was innate in their nature, debating right and wrong through their respective arts. Their father sided with Di, and Huan took his own life, later appearing in a dream to his father, saying, "I taught your son to be a Mohist—it was I!" Di could not submit to him, and their father aided Di—this is why I died in resentment. My true nature has already transformed into the fruit of the catalpa and cypress.

"Good" refers to the goodness of innate conscience and ability. Knowledge, ability, and the heart all arise from true nature—this is called "good." Catalpa and cypress are firm, enduring, and slow to wither. Thus, the nature of a Confucian cannot be altered. Each person has their own Heaven, and scholars expand what is desirable within them.

What the Creator bestows, man cannot forcibly reject; what the Creator does not bestow, man cannot forcibly acquire. This is the division between Huan and Di, Confucianism and Mohism—even the reverence of a father or the affection of an elder brother cannot alter it. For each has their own Heaven, which makes them as they are.

When people despise their kin because their views differ from others, it stems from the bias of their learning. Though this is man’s doing, Heaven remains present in it. The well-fighters of Qi grappled over water, drawing it without knowing its source—just as Confucians of that time clung to the branches, debating right and wrong. Without studying to the point of understanding destiny, one cannot grasp the root.

Those with virtue can feign ignorance as knowledge without self-conceit—how much more so those with the Dao? "Heaven’s punishment" refers to destiny’s natural course, which cannot be escaped. Yet Huan sought to flee it.

*Zhuangzi* rejects the notion that what is peaceful is benevolent and what is not is not—these are all human ways. As for the Way of Heaven, there is neither peace nor its absence; it simply follows principle and responds to the times.

*Bìxū’s Annotation*: Huan killed himself in accumulated resentment; his father’s dream arose from deluded thoughts. The catalpa and cypress atop his grave bore fruit—speaking of his unyielding constancy, sealing this cold-enduring essence as proof.

Li and Kuang’s natures were inherently wise, so the Creator repaid them with wisdom. What one’s nature inherently possesses is repaid in kind—Huan did not himself become a Confucian nor teach his brother to be a Mohist. Scholars contend over teachings and debate, no different from well-drinkers grappling—all driven by the will to prevail. Only those with virtue do not seek recognition—how much more so those with the Dao?

"The punishment of fleeing Heaven" means scorning Heaven’s principles and bringing punishment upon oneself. The sage accepts the long legs of the crane without lengthening the short legs of the hare; the multitude does the opposite, so Heaven’s principles and human affairs clash.

*Yuànzhāi* says: The river moistens nine *li*, its beneficence vast—using its surplus, he had his brother study Mohism. Their studies differed, their arguments diverged. Their father loved Di and aided him; Huan resented his father and killed himself, then appeared in a dream, saying, "The resources I provided for your son to become a Mohist were my surplus beneficence. Now our contention has led to death—why not look at the pines and cypresses atop my grave, already bearing fruit?" This spoke of how long he had been dead.

"Good" is *làng*, pronounced like "lang," meaning a grave. *Zhuangzi* thus concludes: Huan claimed he could make his brother a Mohist, not knowing the Creator repays man according to a principle of retribution—not by man’s abilities, but by what man receives from Heaven. His brother studied Mohism and became a Mohist—this was the Creator responding to his Heaven, not Huan’s human effort in providing resources. "That which made him so"—the first "that" refers to the Creator, the second to his brother.

"Man" here refers to Huan. The well-drinkers of Qi grappled over water, claiming it as their own—Huan’s views were no different. Those with virtue regard the Creator as unknowable—how much more so those who have attained the Dao?

"Fleeing" means abandoning one’s Heavenly principles. "Punishment" means offending the Creator. Each person has an innate nature, bestowed by Heaven and unalterable. Huan’s Confucianism and Di’s Mohism were both inherent in their natures, merely cultivated through learning.

Confucians follow Yao and Shun; Mohists follow the Great Yu—both studied under sages. Confucians uphold the Mean; Mohists drift into universal love, where excess is as flawed as deficiency, so the sagely school does not accept them. At that time, both Confucianism and Mohism led to honor and prominence. Huan boasted of being a Confucian while making his brother a Mohist, taking pride in this.

The two teachings pursued different aims, leading to debate. Their father, unable to judge them impartially, sided with Di. As Huan, he should have yielded and gradually enlightened them—Heavenly nature has no principle of irrevocable loss. Why rush to resent his father and take his own life? The harm was great!

His lingering resentment manifested in a dream to his father: "Why not look at my grave? My spirit has already transformed into the fruit of the catalpa and cypress." "Fruit" here means essence—speaking of his unchanging constancy, his true nature still preserved.

*Zhuangzi* thus concludes: The Creator’s repayment to man is not for the person but for the person’s Heaven. "Repayment" means return. "Heaven" refers to nature. Huan transformed into another being, no longer retaining his form, yet he appeared in a dream to explain himself—his nature had not perished.

That passage serves to bind the preceding text, declaring that human form is not enduring, yet nature must have its return—what is held in a single thought cannot be extinguished. Huan died in resentment, yet his nature did not perish but transformed into wood of unyielding constancy. If one nurtures life according to principle, fulfills their years, leaves no entanglements, and follows transformation to return to the origin—how then shall their true nature find its home?

The tale of the man of Zheng becoming catalpa and cypress seems strange, yet when measured against Kuafu’s birth of Deng Forest, it may well be so. For whether sentient or insentient, the transformations of life have no limit—all arise within the mutations of form and vessel. Man dwells amid these yet remains unaware, thus changing along with them. But if one knows there is that which is formless and unchanging, then one is not subject to the transformations of things but can transform things instead.

All men are, in the end, like Huan—hence the rebuke of the world’s scholars for their shallowness, whose vision is thus confined. How can they hope to penetrate the Three Powers and govern the myriad things? The virtuous act through unknowing. Huan’s loss of the Way came from knowing and making distinctions. To be utterly without knowledge of how—this is to preserve one’s Heaven.

The "punishment of fleeing Heaven" has no single interpretation. Examining what brings ease and what brings unease in the text below serves as evidence. Some divide it into a separate chapter, disrupting the coherence of the classic’s meaning. Huan fled the principle of nature, turning his back on the Heaven of father, son, and brother—this is to be ill at ease where one should be at ease. His resentment drove him to seek punishment, finding ease where one should find none.

*Nanhua* concludes Huan’s case with the phrase "punishment of fleeing Heaven," offering a warning to later generations who defy Heavenly principle and, through stubborn self-will, bring ruin upon themselves.

**“Mastering Adversity” – Zhuangzi said:**
To know the Dao is easy; to refrain from speaking of it is hard. Knowing yet not speaking—this is how one aligns with Heaven. Knowing and speaking—this is how one aligns with man. The ancients aligned with Heaven and not with man.

**Zhu’s Commentary:**
Learning to "slay dragons" from Master Disjointed Limb, one may exhaust a thousand gold pieces from a household, yet after three years of mastery, find no use for such skill.

The sage treats the inevitable as if it were not, and so remains free of conflict. The common people treat the uncertain as if it were certain, and so abound in conflict. Yielding to conflict, they act with desire. Conflict, when relied upon, brings ruin.

The petty man’s knowledge clings to bribes and letters, squandering spirit on trivial pursuits, yet aspires to guide all things and embody the Great Unity in emptiness. Such a one is deluded by the cosmos, burdened in form, unaware of the Great Beginning. The perfected person, however, returns spirit to the Beginningless and delights in the realm of Nothing-Whatsoever. Like water flowing without form, it issues forth into the Great Purity.

Alas! Your knowledge dwells in the tip of a hair, yet you know not the Great Peace!

**Guo’s Annotation:**
Though knowledge embraces heaven and earth, it never opens speech to lure others, responding only to what is fitting. Affairs lie in aptness, not in prizing distant achievement. Though principle may be certain, to treat it as if it were not—this is perfect compliance. How could conflict arise? Though principle may be uncertain, to insist upon it breeds discord, for each clings to their own view. When things follow their nature, they are sufficient; when sufficient, they seek nothing. If compelled to act, one who takes tranquility as paramount does not perish.

Bribes for favors, letters for inquiries—these are the pursuits of petty knowledge. Obsessed with trifles, one gains little, yet seeks to guide all things, traversing emptiness and venturing afar. Ambition outstrips spirit, form becomes a burden, and one loses the Way in confusion. Thus the perfected person, serene and non-active, follows the course of Heaven. Knowledge that grasps only the small must rest in the Great Peace to attain perfection.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
The distinction between aligning with Heaven and aligning with man—this "non-action" is why even the mad and the cowering seem akin, while knowledge never draws near the Yellow Emperor.

The dragon, as a creature, resembles the transformations of sagely wisdom. To "slay" it is to cast it aside. Exhausting a thousand gold pieces empties one’s possessions. With no use for such skill, one also has no need to cast it aside—this is the wholeness of Heaven.

No conflict is more bitter than that of the will; even the finest swords are inferior. The sage’s talent establishes what is established and enacts what is enacted—this may be certain, yet he never insists upon it, leaving it to Heaven. Thus, treating the inevitable as if it were not, he is not wounded by frustration, and so remains free of conflict. The common people do the opposite, and so abound in conflict. Acting in accord with conflict, they seek and rely upon it—only to perish.

The petty man’s knowledge does not stray from inquiries and gifts, exhausting spirit in shallow pursuits. Yet he aspires to guide all things, to embody the Great Unity in emptiness—tasks beyond his capacity. This is why he is deluded by the cosmos, burdened in form, unaware of the Great Beginning, unable to achieve the Great Unity in emptiness.

Only the sage returns spirit to the Beginningless and delights in the realm of Nothing-Whatsoever. In movement, like water flowing without form, issuing into the Great Purity, he alone can guide all things and embody the Great Unity in emptiness.

The heart as a thing—none knows its abode, yet it is vast. But when its knowledge clings to bribes and letters, it dwells in the tip of a hair and knows not the Great Peace. How lamentable!

**Yi Du’s Annotation:**
The sage does not speak by intent but responds to things when unavoidable. The hearts of Confucius and Mencius were one, yet their words differed—this is why. Yangzi took delight in speech even when silence was fitting. His intent did not differ from Confucius and Mencius; the gap between them lay only in speaking or not speaking. Thus it is said: To know the Dao is easy; to refrain from speaking of it is hard.

When the Dao prevails over things, one can remain silent. This is how speech and silence distinguish Heaven and man, though in truth they are never separate. Worldly people are consumed by desire, so this is used to correct them.

"Slaying dragons" is the most refined skill of scholars, yet it has no practical use. This speaks of Zhuangzi’s learning—probing principle to the utmost, exhausting nature to reach destiny—yet never pursuing useless endeavors. Thus one must be cautious in method.

"Yielding" is destiny. "Insisting" is righteousness. The sage, though righteousness may present an inevitable course, handles it with yielding, for he recognizes destiny—thus he remains free of conflict. The common people, though righteousness offers no inevitable course, act with insistence, ignorant of destiny—thus they abound in conflict.

*Mencius* says: "Words need not be trusted; actions need not be resolute"—this is treating the inevitable as if it were not. The *Analects* says: "Words must be trusted; actions must be resolute"—how stubbornly petty! This is treating the uncertain as if it were certain.

Conflict does not lie outside; it is the battle of joy and anger within the breast. Yet joy and anger cannot be avoided. Yielding to them, one may gain what is sought; relying upon them, one perishes. They must be moderated.

The use of *baozhi* (fragrant grass) in sacrificial rites, the employment of *gandu* (bamboo slips) and writing tablets to convey sincerity—these are but the doings of common folk, who exhaust their spirit in trivialities. They neither aid the world nor guide beings, nor do they seek union with the Great Oneness or the Way of formless emptiness. Such men are deluded by the cosmos, their forms burdened, unaware of the Great Beginning.

The Great Oneness is the origin of number; the Great Beginning, the origin of *qi*. In formless emptiness, we speak of the Great Oneness; in burdened form, we speak of the Great Beginning. Emptiness cannot be without number, while burdened form suffers from its lack of emptiness—thus it is.

The Beginningless is that which precedes all beginnings, the realm of "nothing whatsoever," the Great Void. Water, stored in the body as the kidneys, governs essence. The common people expend their spirit on affairs and objects, their minds racing in the realm of desires. The perfected man stores his spirit in the Beginningless, delighting in the land of "nothing whatsoever."

The water of the common people flows through form and thus is easily exhausted. The water of the perfected man flows through the formless and is therefore inexhaustible, issuing forth into the Great Purity, reaching everywhere. Yet the petty man knows not the Way of Great Tranquility—how lamentable!

*Bixu’s Commentary*: When the heart holds right and wrong yet remains silent, that is Heaven. When the heart feels compassion and gives it voice, that is man. If Heaven and not man, then inner illumination abides—who can be deceived?

Those whose ambitions sprawl aimlessly pursue learning vast and hollow. Those whose skills are strange and forced gain only fragmentation. The dragon is a creature of transformation: when gathered, it forms a body; when scattered, it becomes a pattern. It cannot be fixed in sight—how then could it be slain? Such claims are but grand words.

Yet when skill is perfected and its artistry finds no use, there lies profound meaning: external things cannot be relied upon. Thus the perfected man remains detached, allowing them to unfold, avoiding resentment and conflict. To insist on mastery is to invite disaster—gouged eyes, spilled blood—can one not be cautious?

*Gengsangzi* said: Before resentment arises, it is already a weapon—how could its harm be limited to blades and arrows? To waste one’s spirit on trivial pursuits, gaining little while losing much—this is to be deluded by the cosmos, unaware of the Great Beginning, like one who sees the tip of an autumn hair yet fails to behold Mount Tai.

To tune strings and pipes yet hear not the thunder—such is the way of the world. To return the spirit to the Beginningless is to conceal one’s brilliance. To delight in the land of "nothing whatsoever" is to embrace emptiness and vastness. Thus one knows action in boundless space and applies it in stillness. Yet you cling to the outermost branches and lose the great root—how tragic!

*Yuanzhai* says: Do not speak of difficulty, for the true difficulty lies in forgetting speech. To know the Way and forget speech is to leave the human realm, to walk with Heaven.

To spend one’s family fortune learning to slay dragons, only to find no use for the skill—*Zhuangzi* likens this to his own Way, vast yet without application. The sage treats the inevitable as if it were not, thus knowing what he does not know. The common people treat the uncertain as if it were certain, hence their many conflicts.

War is the greatest of conflicts. If one follows the impulse to contend, then all actions in the world become quests for adversaries, and in striving for dominance, one loses oneself. Letters and inquiries—trivial matters—how can they aid the world or guide all beings to unite with the origin of the Great Oneness and the subtlety of formlessness? Thus one is deluded by the cosmos, burdened by form, unaware of the natural principle of the Great Beginning. The perfected man returns his spirit to the origin of nothingness and abides in non-action.

"Delighting in sleep" is a metaphor for peaceful abiding. Water flows—people see its form but do not know it arises from the formless. When it issues forth and departs, it returns to the Great Purity of emptiness. The common people, unaware of the beginning and end of things, are like water.

To know the tip of a hair is to see only the small. Great Tranquility is the principle of non-action and naturalness, encompassing all. To know the Way and speak of it is the affair of knowledge. To know the Way and forget speech is the affair of the sage, who is one with Heaven.

The wise who speak of the Way may still broaden instruction and teach others, which is not a grave error. But those of shallow learning, puffed with hearsay and self-satisfaction, though they may not speak, their very demeanor betrays their words—how could they grasp the ancient ones’ union with Heaven’s subtlety?

As for "slaying the dragon," most interpretations disparage the theme, misaligning with the text’s intent. Only Lü’s commentary captures its essence. *Bixu* calls it "useless fame," which also misses the mark. Here, I propose renaming it "Forgetting the Subtle Chapter," and offer my humble insight:

One who studies to seek the Way is like one who enters the sea to find a dragon. Yet few see dragons, and fewer still can slay them. This illustrates the difficulty of attaining the Way—and how much harder it is to forget it once attained.

Beginning with the search for the dragon and glimpsing it, one knows the body’s infinite transformations. Culminating in slaying the dragon, one realizes the Way’s formless, supreme spirit. The dragon is not found in stillness but sought in the indistinct and boundless. Slaying is not done with blades but transcends attachment to flesh and glory.

To exhaust spirit and subtlety—how could the dance of *Sanglin* capture it? To spend a thousand gold coins from one’s household is to empty all possessions. After a thousand days of mastery, the skill finds no use—then, with a single encounter, all is resolved, and both dragon and slayer are forgotten.

The Chan school says: "In Dragon Tooth Mountain, at the sight of the dragon, the heart rests." This is the first stage of practice. I venture that the four lines on "slaying the dragon" are extraordinarily concise, their meaning running parallel to the "Butcher Ding" chapter. That chapter ends with skill still in use; this one transcends both form and function, thus reaching perfection.

The sage treats the inevitable as if it were not—what exists is also as if it did not.

The multitude treats the non-inevitable as inevitable, forcing what is nonexistent into existence. The "soldiers" refer to the cravings and desires warring within—whether they exist or not depends on the person alone. Those who follow these "soldiers" act on their desires and seek fulfillment, unaware that reliance on them leads to ruin. Petty knowledge engages in trivial pursuits, exhausting the spirit—this too is self-sabotage. How can one hope to embrace a will that seeks to guide all things under heaven, to fathom the Great Unity and manifest the emptiness of the world? The Great Unity is the origin of all numbers, from which the myriad things depart from nothingness into being, passing form to form in ceaseless generation and transformation.

The multitude is deluded by the cosmos, for they are shackled by present forms and forget the primordial nothingness of the Great Beginning. The perfected person, however, returns the spirit to the beginningless—this is the realm of the Great Beginning’s nothingness, the land of *what has never been*. Water, foremost among the Five Phases, is visible yet cannot be grasped, possessing form yet also formless. When it descends, it flows and nourishes the myriad things; when its qi ascends, it disperses into the Great Purity. Moving with yin, it accomplishes the work of creation—all lies within this.

Yet the worldly exhaust their intellect on trifles, unaware of the Great Tranquility, the Way that moves in harmony with heaven’s ceaseless turning. Great Tranquility is the unaroused true nature, the unmanifest heart. When things stir a response, it is like the Heavenly One generating water, dispersing into the Great Purity. The Song envoy Cao Shang, sent by the King of Song to Qin, departed with but a few chariots;

The king was pleased and granted him a hundred additional chariots. Upon returning to Song, he sought out Zhuangzi and said: "To dwell in narrow, impoverished lanes, struggling to weave sandals, with a withered neck and sallow face—this is where I fall short. Yet to awaken the lord of ten thousand chariots and secure a following of a hundred chariots—this is where I excel."

Zhuangzi replied: "When the King of Qin fell ill, he summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils and drained abscesses received one chariot; those who licked his hemorrhoids received five chariots. The baser the treatment, the greater the reward. Did you, perchance, treat his hemorrhoids? Why else would you have received so many chariots? Begone!"

Guo’s annotation: Only by stooping low does one achieve great merit; great merit brings rich rewards. Thus, those who embrace lofty detachment forsake worldly glory.
Lü’s annotation: All who debase themselves to seek favor are but lickers of hemorrhoids.
Yidu’s annotation: Cao Shang flaunted his chariots, while Zhuangzi likened him to a hemorrhoid-licker—utter contempt.
Bixu’s annotation: The baser the cure, the greater the reward; thus, those who hold to the Dao forsake glory, while those who chase profit forget disgrace.
Yongzhai’s note: *Zuò* refers to a type of abscess. The baser the physician’s work, the richer the reward—such filth and shame are not worth prizing.
Cao Shang boasted of his chariots, while Master Nan Hua (Zhuangzi) exalted himself through the Dao. Chariots bring fleeting ostentation and everlasting stench; the Dao brings eternal honor and undying fragrance. Can one not be cautious in what one pursues?

Duke Ai of Lu asked Yan He: "I rely on Confucius as the pillar of my state—will it not flourish?"
Yan He replied: "Dangerous indeed! Confucius is crumbling!"

Those who adorn feathers with paint, engage in florid rhetoric, take mere branches as their essence, and harden their natures to govern the people—such men neither know nor trust, yet their doctrines are received by the heart and wielded by the spirit. How can they suffice to lead the people? Are they fit for you, Duke Ai? Or for me? To err in this would be pardonable. Now, to cause the people to abandon substance for false learning is no way to govern them. Considering posterity, it would be better to desist. Such governance is difficult indeed.

What is imposed upon others yet never forgotten is not the spontaneous bounty of Heaven. Merchants are held in contempt; even when ranked among the honored, the spirit disregards them. External punishments are meted out by metal and wood; internal punishments arise from movement and transgression. When petty men incur external punishments, metal and wood interrogate them; when they incur internal punishments, yin and yang consume them. Only the true person can escape both inner and outer punishments.

Guo’s annotation: The perfected person finds peace in the people’s tranquility. To rely on a single pillar is to leave a legacy for ten thousand generations. Yet to vie in adorning oneself with benevolence and righteousness, to embellish one’s plumage with carvings, is to endanger the common folk—even the perfected person can find no peace in this. Such embellishment is not true spontaneity; it will lead later generations to pursue emptiness, their intentions and inclinations running wild. Later rulers, admiring Confucius’ distant path, harden their natures and feign virtue to govern, while those above and below imitate one another unawares. If such men are set above the people, later generations will not merely conform in outward form but will receive and employ their doctrines with heart and spirit, no longer finding their own nature within. Those people—you, Duke Ai—each have their own proper way. To imitate one another is to lose authenticity. This is the present-day proof: to model oneself after another is no way to nurture oneself. It is simply impermissible.

This is a consideration for posterity, not a judgment on the present. To govern is to foster falsity, which is why the sage does not govern. To disseminate and recognize such doctrines is to treat the myriad things as straw dogs. Merchants are held in contempt—how much more so scholars and gentlemen? Though one may be compelled to rank them in affairs, their inability to forget themselves causes the spirit to spurn them. Such is the great truth of the common people!

Metal refers to blades, saws, axes, and halberds; wood refers to cudgels, fetters, and stocks. When one is still and proper, there is no punishment, inner or outer. Those who do not follow the bright and open path are called petty men. When one moves beyond measure, one’s nature and qi are harmed within, while metal and wood interrogate without. Unless one is a true person, none can halt this process.

Lü’s annotation: The *Book of Changes* takes *zhen* as the pillar of affairs. All movement under Heaven is rectified by the One. Only by forgetting the heart can one attain the One; attaining the One is how one becomes a pillar. Those who govern the world and its states—if they do not understand this but merely rely on sagely wisdom for governance, the harm will inevitably reach the state described here.

The Dao models itself on the natural, just as the swan’s whiteness comes not from daily washing but from its innate nature. When sagely wisdom becomes a burden, it is like painting feathers—feathers are the natural essence of Heaven, while painting is the artifice of man. Pursuing florid rhetoric to magnify the small or confuse names and realities, acting contrary to nature—all such efforts are forced. To suppress one’s nature in governing the people, yet remain unaware of their distrust, is to fail to forget the heart and instead be enslaved by it, to fail to embody the spirit and instead be ruled by it. This is how one becomes a servant of the people—how could such a one be fit to lead them?

The reason the Dao cannot be shared with others is that its core lacks a master and thus remains unrectified. Can Confucius truly set you right, or must you cultivate yourself? Only by cutting off learning and nurturing the heart can one attain the One. To rely solely on the sage as a pillar is a mistake—it is not the way to true rectitude. To abandon true learning for falsity is no way to govern the people. If one claims to act like clouds drifting and rain falling, why not simply forget all effort?

Merchants are not ranked with scholars—this is ancient ritual. Yet the ritual of ranking by occupation is a human convention, for the spiritual does not rank itself; this is the nature of man. To value righteousness and disdain profit is the true expression of human nature. Those who pursue profit and forget righteousness have lost their original heart. Metal and wood punish the body; movement and excess punish the heart. Stillness and non-action are the heart’s rectitude; all movement is deviation. To act and yet seek propriety is to proceed from necessity—otherwise, all is excess.

Yang Xiong said that by day, men’s faults are few; by night, their faults are many. "Night" here means the same as "petty." Those who practice the Dao without attaining its radiance and greatness, yet still incur inner and outer punishment, remain petty men. Only the true person acts in stillness, proceeding from necessity—how could inner and outer punishments ever burden them?

Yi Du’s annotation: Duke Ai knew only the coarse aspects of Confucius, so he wished to employ him as a pillar. All affairs return to rectitude as all branches grow from the trunk. Yet Yan He said that if Confucius were to govern a state, not only would he fail to bring order, but he would endanger it. He would merely adorn his plumage, amplify its colors, and indulge in florid rhetoric, neglecting substance. Taking branches for fingers, he would lose his original nature. Desiring to suppress and control, he would govern the people with falsity, unaware of their distrust. If later rulers followed his example, they would take his traces to heart, let his spirit rule them, and fail to transcend form to follow their nature and destiny—how could they be fit to lead the people?

Moreover, the people and Duke Ai each have their own nature and destiny—how could they imitate you? If you wish to imitate him, that is not the way to nurture yourself. To speak of employing Confucius as a pillar is acceptable as a misstatement, but not as a correct one. To abandon true learning for falsity is no way to govern the people, for fear that later generations would chase his traces and perpetuate error. Better to let things follow their nature.

"Distribution" is like the flow of a spring—its use has weight, and when given to others, it is not forgotten; this is human distribution. Heavenly distribution gives without the giver seeing the thing, and the receiver remains unaware of the favor. Human distribution gives with the expectation of repayment. Even merchants are not ranked with scholars, though ranked by occupation, for the spiritual does not rank itself. Affairs and the Dao are distinct!

Metal and wood harm the four limbs; movement and excess harm the five viscera. Petty men, being benighted, cannot escape inner and outer punishment. Beginning with the ebb and flow of yin and yang, if one cannot return, metal and wood will reach them. Only the true person can avoid this!

The *Bixu Annotation* states: Painting feathers for adornment, embellishing with florid and branching rhetoric, and governing the people with deliberate artifice—thus do customs become rife with falsity. Taking up affairs wearies the mind; controlling things exhausts the spirit. One will sicken oneself—how then can one govern the people?

"Yu" (與) and "yi" (颐) are both pronounced like the "yu" in *dangyu* (party faction); I follow the pronunciation of *tuiyu* (推與, to bestow). "Bi" (彼) refers to Confucius. "Ru er" (汝爾) denotes the multitude. It speaks of Confucius’ virtue being worthy of the people’s allegiance, yet if one carelessly applies his methods of nurturing the masses, one cannot know whether they will succeed or fail. Abandoning substance for false learning, one governs in such a way that the people are expected not to forget one’s virtue—this is not due to lack of intention. Even peddlers and hawkers may not expect repayment, let alone scholars and gentlemen!

Bestowing favors and expecting repayment is what worldly sentiment praises; bestowing without favor and receiving without repayment is what the principles of the Dao esteem. Demanding repayment for favors gives rise to harm through punishment. External punishments come from metal and wood; internal punishments arise from movement and excess. Whether manifest or hidden, none can escape them. Thus, those who enact laws find their hearts torn between ice and fire; those who violate decrees face the axe and halberd in the outer world. When superiors and inferiors alike lose their harmony, how can one hope for order and governance?

*Yuanzhai* says: "Zhenggan" (贞干) means worthy assistants, steadfast and capable of managing affairs. Having painted with colors, one further adorns with feathers—this speaks of excessive literary embellishment. Taking "branches" (支) as the aim, one forgets the root. Suppressing one’s nature through forced rectitude and governing from above, one displays what is unreal without even realizing it.

What is received by the heart becomes fixed therein, and thus the spirit and consciousness take it as their sovereign. How can one who is thus governed suffice to lead the people? *"Yi"* means "to benefit"; *"yi"* (颐) means "to nourish." If you regard another as worthy and nourish them, it will bring no benefit to you—it may mislead you, but it will not improve your lot. Better to desist.

The people may be governed without governing; to govern with intent is to make governance difficult. To administer policies without forgetting them is to govern with intent—like a merchant who, when taken for a scholar, is deemed unworthy of equal standing. Even if circumstances bring them together, the spirit finds no joy in it. Such are men of contrivance; thus, those who embody the Dao disdain to associate with them.

*"Xun"* means interrogation; *"shi"* (食) is akin to the *shi* in "eclipse," denoting affliction. The transgressions and faults of the human body are no different from punishments and executions. Only the Perfected escape this.

Duke Ai sought Confucius as his assistant, hoping for a cure to his ailing state—like one who, being ill, seeks a physician. The more urgent the plea, the greater the expectation; thus, he questioned Yan He to confirm his resolve. He then enumerated the flaws of contemporary worthies, showing that exalting them brought no benefit but only fostered hypocrisy and deceit, making the people harder to govern.

Confucius, the most prominent of the worthies of his time, serves here as an example. Adorning with feathers and embellishing with colors—this metaphor speaks of engaging in florid rhetoric, fragmented and divorced from the root, forcing one’s nature to display what is false, unaware that the people, seeing through it, respond with deceit.

When things arrive, the heart receives them; when the heart receives things, the spirit governs them. With no inner emptiness and outer turmoil, one is no different from the common folk—how can such a one lead them?

He further asked: Does Confucius truly benefit you? Can you nourish your people yourself? *"Wu"* (误) should be *"wu"* (悟), "to awaken." You ought to reflect and awaken to this truth. All that has been said above leads people away from genuine learning toward falsity—it is no way to set an example for the world. Better not to act at all.

The people are difficult to govern because their knowledge is excessive, yet this stems from those above who incite it. Such conduct is like that of merchants, unworthy of being ranked with scholars. Even if, for a time, they are accorded equal standing—such as in village festivals or communal feasts—the spirit still disdains their company, for their aspirations differ. Herein lies the division between the worthy and the unworthy.

Those petty men who study falsity cannot escape the punishments of inner and outer realms. *"Xiaoren"* (宵人) refers to those who grope in darkness without insight, who, though in broad daylight, remain as if in endless night. *"Movement"* refers to the first deviation of the heart’s intent; *"excess"* manifests in action. Once excess takes form, it cannot be concealed—thus, metal and wood interrogate it, and yin and yang afflict it. *"Shi"* (食) means "to invade." The Perfected, embodying purity and non-action, how could inner or outer punishments reach them?

*End of the One Hundredth Scroll of the* Southern Florescence Scripture: An Ocean of Subtle Meanings
*Beginning of the One Hundred and First Scroll of the* Southern Florescence Scripture: An Ocean of Subtle Meanings

Master Chu Boxiu of Wulin, on *Liezi* Chapter Three:

Confucius said: "The human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to fathom than Heaven. Heaven at least has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer—and its fixed times of dawn and dusk. But man conceals his true nature beneath a thick façade and deep emotions. Thus, some appear meek yet grow arrogant; some seem mature yet act unworthy; some appear compliant yet prove insightful; some seem resolute yet prove weak; some seem relaxed yet prove fierce. Those who rush toward righteousness as if parched will flee from it as if burned.

Therefore, the noble person tests them from afar to observe their loyalty, up close to observe their reverence, under pressure to observe their competence, with sudden questions to observe their wisdom, with urgent deadlines to observe their trustworthiness, with entrusted wealth to observe their benevolence, with warnings of danger to observe their integrity, with intoxication to observe their restraint, and in mixed company to observe their demeanor. When all nine tests are complete, the unworthy are revealed."

Guo’s commentary: "More treacherous than mountains and rivers... flee from it as if burned" describes how human nature and appearance can contradict each other. Though difficult to discern, they are not without traces. The noble are easy to recognize, while the unworthy are hard to discern. Yet by observing their conduct, examining their comforts, and searching through proper channels, they too can be known.

Lü’s commentary: "Meek" implies little self-assertion, hence its opposite is arrogance. "Mature" contrasts with "unworthy." "Compliant yet hasty" contrasts with "insightful"—for the insightful are upright and fond of righteousness, unlike the merely compliant. "Resolute" and "weak," "relaxed" and "fierce" are all opposites, so one cannot rely on a single approach in assessment.

Yi Du’s commentary: The treachery of mountains and rivers is visible, but the treachery of the human heart is formless. Heaven’s movements follow fixed cycles, but the human heart’s changes are unpredictable. Even the treachery of mountains and rivers and the transformations of Heaven are hard to grasp—how much more so the human heart! "Thick façade and deep emotions" speak to its unfathomable nature. From "appear meek yet grow arrogant" to "seem relaxed yet prove fierce," human nature and appearance contradict each other, yet they are not without traces—only difficult to discern. Zhuangzi’s nine tests observe the heart through outward signs, revealing whether one is noble or petty.

Bixu’s commentary: This speaks of how the treachery of mountains and rivers is visible, while the treachery of the human heart is hard to measure. Some have stern appearances yet arrogant natures; some appear mature yet act unworthy; some seem compliant yet prove distant; some seem resolute yet prove weak; some seem relaxed yet prove fierce. With such contradictions between inner and outer, one cannot rely on a single approach. Thus, the noble employ the nine tests: the loyal remain steadfast even when sent far away; the reverent do not slacken when near; the competent do not falter under pressure; the wise adapt without confusion; the trustworthy keep their word without wavering; the benevolent do not deceive when handling wealth; the principled do not falter in danger; the restrained do not lose control when drunk; the pure remain unstained in mixed company. If one judges character merely by superficial impressions rather than concrete actions, one cannot fully grasp the true nature of the noble and the petty.

Yunzhai’s commentary: Some appear meek yet seek personal gain; some conceal their strengths behind an unworthy guise; some are compliant or hasty yet understand reason; some seem resolute yet prove weak; some seem relaxed yet prove fierce. This shows how unpredictable people can be. "As if parched" describes their eagerness; "as if burned" describes their swift retreat. Through the nine tests, the worthy and unworthy become clear. This passage’s reasoning is sound—by attributing it to Confucius, we see that Zhuangzi was not disrespectful toward him.

Heaven has its cycles of cold and heat, clear and rainy weather, which can be predicted by calculations. Earth has its mountains, rivers, valleys, and ravines, which can be crossed by bridges and boats. But the human heart, in its small compass, holds changes and treacheries beyond measure or remedy. Why is this? The human heart’s grasp or loss of principle, its comings and goings, are untimely—this is what makes it so hard to know or see. Yet when it clings to something, its form becomes visible. By observing appearances and scrutinizing words, one can grasp six or seven parts of it. But if one cloaks it in depth and thickness, one cannot avoid testing it.

Those whose hearts are upright manifest uprightness in all their actions; those whose hearts are crooked manifest crookedness in all their actions. Though they may cunningly disguise themselves, there is always something they cannot conceal—this is how the noble and the petty are distinguished. The key lies with those in authority: if they wish to remain within bounds, approachable and close to the people, then the hearts of the world will be as one, and its customs as harmonious as a single family. What need is there to fear the difficulty of knowing them, or to worry about the difficulty of transforming them?

From "appear meek" to "as if burned" describes the contradictions between inner and outer. From "test them from afar" to "in mixed company" examines the steadfastness of their principles. While the nine tests can reveal the worthy and unworthy, they are laborious. It is better to remain empty in the face of events and calmly observe their eyes and movements—as if seeing their very lungs and liver. If one further speaks and gains their trust, how can they escape judgment?

When Zheng Kaofu received his first appointment, he bowed; at his second, he stooped; at his third, he bent low, walking along the wall. Who would dare to transgress! But take the likes of that man: at his first appointment, he strutted like Lü Ju; at his second, he danced atop his carriage; at his third, he called his elders by name. Who could compare to Tang or Xu! The greatest harm lies in virtue with intent, and intent with eyes—once it has eyes, it turns inward, and turning inward, it fails.

There are five grave vices, with "inner virtue" as the foremost. What is "inner virtue"? It is when one prides oneself on one’s goodness and derides what one does not do.

Poverty has eight extremes; success has three certainties; the body has six repositories. Handsome beards, tall stature, robust build, striking beauty, and courage—though one may surpass others in all eight, they may still lead to ruin.

The Green Follower, the Prostrate Wanderer, and the Timid Inferior—those who embody all three attain mastery. Wisdom that extends outward invites trouble; bold action breeds resentment; benevolence and righteousness bring reproach.

Those who grasp the essence of life are marveled at; those who grasp knowledge are diminished; those who grasp the great mandate follow it; those who grasp the petty mandate encounter it.

*(Guo’s Annotation: "Tang" refers to Yao. "Xu" refers to Xu You. It speaks of how that man and Kaofu could not compare to the deeds of Tang and Xu.)*

Virtue with intent is not true virtue. True virtue arises spontaneously, unknowing of its own attainment. To act with the heart’s inclination as virtue is still acceptable; but to constrain the heart within the space between brows and lashes is already gross pretense. If one then seeks to probe hidden depths and make profundity one’s pursuit, both heart and endeavor will fail.

To assert oneself as right and others as wrong invites attacks from many quarters—thus becoming the foremost calamity. If within there is no self-satisfied sentiment, and one freely affirms whatever the myriad things affirm, each affirmation unerring, then all under heaven will yearn to serve them.

"Poverty" refers to being exhausted by servitude. The world is never impoverished by its shortcomings but is constantly ensnared by its strengths.

The Green Follower walks leaning on things; the Prostrate Wanderer cannot bow to take up tasks; the Timid Inferior is weak and fearful.

These three, being unfit for practical service, are instead employed as assistants—thus they must attain understanding.

One who is outwardly unconstrained will, by boundlessness, harm their inner self; timid yet composed, they merely preserve their person. As for benevolence and righteousness, all under heaven expect their love, yet love cannot be all-encompassing—hence many reproaches arise.

*Kuiran*: vast and untroubled. *Xiao*: released and dispersed. The *sui* (follower) merges indistinctly with transformation. The *da* (understanding one) awakens only by abiding at the nodal point.

Lu’s commentary: From Zheng Kaofu to the refined harmony of Tang and Xu, one sees how vessel and capacity vary—those who "know not, perceive not" yet follow Heaven’s pattern, while those who defame it become rebels. Virtue possesses a heart, and the heart possesses an eye; knowledge is complete, yet it corrupts the pattern—no greater thief exists than this. "Inward vision" is precisely what is called a thief.

When the five senses stir, lost and unable to return, none is not calamitous. The central virtue is foremost: if virtue has a heart, then it has a self; if it has a self, it asserts itself as right and others as wrong—thus it harbors self-satisfaction and sucks at what it does not do.

If all eight surpass others, one becomes self-satisfied—hence impoverished. If the three fall short of others, one strives—hence attains understanding. Mencius’ discussion of solitary ministers and disinherited sons, their vigilance and careful consideration of rightness, is of the same vein.

When wisdom and intelligence extend outward, things arrive. Courageous action breeds resentment; benevolence and righteousness invite reproach—this clarifies that what the vulgar world deems fine is not truly fine, and what it deems foul is not truly foul. The essential point lies in the strong-willed who possess resolve, leaving their form behind.

One who, in life, attains understanding is what is called "Heaven-born"—they know nothing of "knowing," existing merely as *kuiran*. One who, in knowledge, attains understanding knows that what they know arises from non-knowing yet cannot return to non-knowing—merely *xiao*. Fate is what the Creator enacts; we and the Creator are human—thus one who understands the great mandate follows it without departure. Knowing that poverty and success lie with Heaven, not with oneself, one who understands the minor mandate encounters it without refusal.

*Yi du* notes: A single-command officer, a double-command grandee, a triple-command minister. *Yanlou* to "following the wall"—all describe the dignity of yielding and deferring, where rank increases and deference deepens. "Unruly" means to insult. *Lüju*: the bearing of an erect waist. "Dancing atop the carriage" is the height of frivolity. "Summoning one’s uncles" is the extreme of right-handed arrogance. Yao and Xu yielded the world, yet those who could not do so—how could they match Tang and Xu? This speaks of the noble who, upon receiving mandate, grow ever more reverent, and the petty who, upon receiving mandate, grow ever more insolent.

Virtue with a heart is lower virtue; higher virtue has no heart. A heart with an eye is a moving heart; a still heart has no eye. Virtue with a heart steals the Dao; a heart with an eye steals virtue. When Dao and virtue are lost, human artifice arises; when artifice arises, inward vision follows. Thoughts and schemes, bustling and restless, corrupt one’s true nature.

The "calamitous virtues" are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and heart. The heart is the central virtue; when it moves, the four follow. If within there is self-satisfaction, and others do not conform to one’s preferences, one reviles them—this is the heart’s theft.

The eight that surpass others inevitably become enslaved by others—hence impoverished. The three that fall short of others yet preserve their person—hence attain understanding. Humans possess eight extremes and three necessities, just as the body has six repositories—this is the natural principle.

When wisdom and intelligence extend outward, they harm the inner self. Courageous action, driven by nature, invites resentment. Insistence on righteousness leads others to expect love and heap reproach. One who understands the essence of life is greatly awakened and unbound. One who understands the essence of fate is one with the divine. One who understands knowledge is *xiao*. *Xiao* is small; the Dao is great—hence it seems un-*xiao*.

One who understands the great mandate forgets life and death, free of encumbrance, delighting in Heaven. One who understands the minor mandate accepts poverty and wealth, longevity and early death as they come, at peace. Bi Xu notes: *Wenzi* says, "The Dao with knowledge is chaotic; virtue with a heart is perilous; a heart with an eye is dazzled." "Having a heart" means amplifying love and rightness. "Having an eye" means chasing after appearances. "Inward vision" means discerning, distinguishing, rejecting, and selecting. The "calamitous virtues" are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and heart. The heart governs within; self-satisfied and self-righteous, it reviles those who differ—this is called inward vision, and inward vision is corruption.

All who excel at overcoming things will, in time, become impoverished. Those who fear falling short of others will, in time, attain understanding. This is the principle of rise and fall. Wisdom and intelligence turned outward harm the inner self; courageous action invites resentment; benevolence and righteousness, unyielding, are misapplied—none preserve the person.

Thus, one who understands the essence of life is greatly awakened and unbound. One who understands knowledge is *xiao*, resembling foolishness. One who understands the great mandate follows life and death. One who understands the minor mandate accepts encounters with equanimity—how can poverty or success burden them?

Juan Zhai says: The lines on virtue having a heart are most intimate to the learner’s condition. Chan schools call this the "leaking mind" or the "second thought." To practice virtue while knowing it as virtue is to have a heart. Within this heart, there is the intent to calculate and scheme—this opens an eye. With this eye-opened heart, one turns inward, and the myriad distinctions no longer recognize the undifferentiated whole.

The "calamitous virtues" refer to the heart, ears, eyes, and nose. "Having self-satisfaction" means priding oneself on ability while reviling others’ inability—this heart is unfit for learning the Dao. *Yuanjue* says: "Do not disdain long practice, nor belittle the beginner." This is the same idea.

The "eight extremes" mean that relying on anything will lead to impoverishment. The "three necessities" mean that contented insufficiency may yet attain understanding. *Yuanxun*: compliant and yielding. *Yanxia*: the bearing of rising and falling. "The body has six repositories" means the six abodes of accumulation within the human form.

Wisdom, courage, benevolence and righteousness, attaining life, attaining knowledge, and attaining destiny—these are the six. "Encountering" still harbors the heart of gain and loss, of entrusting to fate; "following" means to let it be without reservation. The six repositories are later drawn out into two concluding phrases through the character *ming* (destiny)—this is the structure of the text.

Zheng Kaofu, the tenth-generation ancestor of Confucius, was a grandee of Song. This passage still echoes the dialogue between Duke Ai and Yan He regarding the remnants of Wei’s governance. It speaks of how the sage and the worthy conduct themselves in the world, never allowing prosperity or adversity to burden their hearts. "Thrice commanded and creeping along walls"—this is fear of success. "Thrice commanded and named among the elders"—this is arrogance in success. Both remain ensnared by the shocks of favor and disgrace; how could they ever align with the lofty aspirations of Yao, Tang, or Xu You? Yao’s yellow-roofed carriage was not of his own desire; Xu You’s refusal to overstep his role—though their paths differed, their hearts were one. Thus, this is used to conclude the preceding chapter’s meaning.

Later, it discusses the folly of worldly self-regard, unaware that prosperity and adversity arise from destiny. To practice virtue with a calculating heart gives rise to distinctions, and thus one’s kindness cannot be vast. To labor the mind with fixed views leads to excessive deliberation and inner restlessness. Kindness that is not vast harms virtue; inner restlessness harms the heart. These are the greatest corruptions.

"Inward vision" means to ponder one’s desires, to scheme and arrange as if before one’s eyes, to plan for certain success—only for ruin to follow. The Buddhists speak of five kinds of eyes: only the heavenly eye and the fleshly eye reside in the face; the wisdom eye, the Dharma eye, and the Buddha eye all reside in the heart. Their heart-eye is manifest, the effect of cultivated virtue; this heart-eye is a warning, the root of moral failure. If one does not guard against failure, how can one ever attain success? The teachings of the two schools stand as outer and inner to each other.

Are there five calamitous virtues? They are seeing, hearing, speaking, bearing, and thinking—all that do not proceed from rectitude. The heart governs within and leads the head; when one prides oneself as peerless and reviles others, this is the beginning of moral failure. With the four calamities following, what evil would one not commit? If one can return to the central virtue from within, the path back is not far; turning misfortune into fortune lies in human effort alone.

The "eight extremes" and "three necessities" are also marvelous, embodying the principle of mutual generation and cyclical recurrence—just as the organs and viscera within the human body respond to the waxing and waning of yin and yang without self-awareness.

Wisdom is meant to cultivate virtue, yet when applied externally and entangled in affairs, it stirs courage and breeds resentment. Benevolence and righteousness are meant to extend kindness, yet broad relief is difficult; thus, one’s aid is incomplete and invites blame. One who attains life is serene and at ease; one who attains knowledge forgets knowledge entirely. The great destiny is followed and entrusted; the small destiny is accepted as it comes. This is why the worthy and the noble find joy in both adversity and prosperity, leaving worldly troubles far behind.

*Yu yi* is difficult to interpret; it should mean "you." *Xiao* is pronounced *xiao* and shares the same meaning.

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin on *Liezi*, Chapter Four

A man who had an audience with the King of Song was granted ten chariots. With these ten chariots, he grew arrogant and sought to belittle Master Zhuang.

Master Zhuang said: "By the river lived a poor family who made their living weaving reeds. Their son dived into the depths and obtained a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him, 'Fetch a stone and smash it!' For a pearl of such value must lie beneath the chin of the black dragon in the ninefold abyss. That you could obtain it means you must have encountered the dragon while it slept. Had the black dragon awakened, what trace of you would remain?

Now, the depths of the state of Song are not merely a ninefold abyss, and the King of Song is not merely a black dragon. That you could obtain those chariots means you must have encountered him while he slept. Had the King of Song awakened, you would have been ground to powder!"

Another man was sent to extend an invitation to Master Zhuang. Zhuang responded to the envoy, saying: "Have you not seen the sacrificial ox? It is clothed in embroidered robes and fed with fine grass and beans. Yet when it is led into the grand ancestral temple, though it might wish to be a lone calf again, could it ever be so?"

Guo's commentary: "Those who seek wealth and rank must align with the people’s expectations. If one clings to strange doctrines, rides the celestial thoroughfare, and seeks to sway the ruler’s heart, a wise sovereign will not accept it. Thus, if there is praise, there must be trial. Only when the people are not opposed and the multitude’s hopes are met can one be raised to office—this is how the Three Dynasties followed the straight path."

Those who cherish life fear the sacrificial knife and decline invitations; the skull, hearing of life, knits its brows in disdain. The sentiments of life and death differ, each appropriate in its own way.

Lü's commentary: "Those in the world who risk danger, seeking favor and fame without awakening, are all like the pearl-diver. This is what the perfected ones find perilous and lament. Yet they use such gains to boast before others—is this not absurd? Master Zhuang entered a state beyond death and life, once declaring death as joyous as a king facing south. Thus, the sacrificial ox of the grand temple holds no terror for him. Yet the common folk endanger body and life in pursuit of profit, which is why his conduct is so restrained."

Yi Du's commentary: "Weaving reeds for food is the basest of trades. Yet when the son dived and obtained a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces, it was because he encountered the black dragon while it slept. Had the dragon awakened, what would have become of him? Now, how is your obtaining the King of Song’s chariots any different? He also cited the sacrificial ox in response to the envoy, refusing to let wealth and rank burden his life."

Bixu's commentary: "Gaining a pearl while weaving reeds—how is this different from a quail hatching where no field was tilled? That one chanced upon the dragon’s sleep was already perilous. To boast of ten chariots while forgetting the disaster of being ground to powder, or to decline an invitation while yearning for the life of a lone calf—such is the difference between the wise and the foolish."

Yuanzhai's note: "*Jiao xi* means to be haughty and treat others as children. *Wei xiao* refers to weaving reeds into mats. Obtaining the pearl while the dragon slept illustrates how those who seek wealth and rank tread a perilous path. If their ruler awakens, the calamity will not be light—what trace of them would remain? To be left with nothing but scraps."

The passage on the sacrificial ox in the ancestral temple shares the same meaning as the tortoise dragging its tail through the mud. *Wei xiao* is also written as *wei xiao* (reed mats), referring to gathering firewood for sustenance—Bixu’s edition follows this reading. When the boy dived into the abyss and playfully retrieved the pearl, it was unexpected, so he did not recognize its wonder. Nor did he heed whether the black dragon slept or woke. But when his father wished to test the pearl by striking it with a stone, he acted with intent. Moreover, he warned that if the black dragon awoke, they would be ground to powder. Having narrowly escaped death once, how could he dare descend into the abyss again? This analogy illustrates that seizing what others desire invites grave misfortune. Even if one obtains it by chance without intent, such luck cannot be repeated. "*What trace would remain?*"—some suspect the character *wei* (trace) omits *qu* (body), but this is even less plausible. These four words are a stroke of genius; Yongzhai’s interpretation is apt.

The metaphor of the sacrificial ox requires no further explanation.

When Zhuangzi was near death, his disciples wished to bury him with lavish rites. Zhuangzi said: "I take heaven and earth as my coffin and outer coffin, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars as my pearls and jades, and the myriad things as my funeral gifts. Are my burial rites not already complete? What more could be added?" His disciples said: "We fear that crows and kites will devour you." Zhuangzi replied: "Above, I would be eaten by crows and kites; below, by ants and mole crickets. To snatch from one to give to the other—how partial is that! To seek balance through imbalance is to fail to achieve true balance; to seek verification through unverified means is to fail to achieve true verification. The enlightened are but tools of the numinous; the numinous verifies all. That the enlightened cannot surpass the numinous has long been so. Yet fools rely on their limited vision to impose upon others—such efforts are external, is it not lamentable?"

Guo’s commentary: To impose one’s own notion of balance upon the myriad things is inferior to allowing them to find balance on their own. To force a response based on one’s own perceptions rather than letting things respond naturally will inevitably fail. Those who act upon their limited vision are themselves enslaved—how can they command others? Only by following the numinous can one attain perfect harmony, thus responding effortlessly to all things. The reach of enlightenment extends no further than form and appearance; perfect harmony transcends distance, depth, and obscurity, allowing each thing to find its own fulfillment. Action arises from without, but its efficacy resides in things. If one clings to one’s own views and insists on being right, even the desire to influence others will result in external exertion.

Lü’s commentary: To embody the unity and sameness of heaven, earth, and the myriad things is to live fully equipped to sustain one’s form; in death, to use them as funeral gifts is no empty claim. To spare oneself from being eaten by crows, kites, ants, or mole crickets is to fall into partiality of giving and taking. Only without intent is there no giving or taking. To balance through balance is to achieve perfect balance; to verify through verification is to achieve perfect verification. But with intent, there is inevitably selection and rejection, losing one’s constant mind—this is the height of unverified and unbalanced. To seek balance is to fail to achieve true balance; to seek verification is to fail to achieve true verification. Like water, it is stillness that brings balance, which the great craftsman emulates. Only because it is balanced can it balance all; only because it is verified can it verify all. Those who today know how to give and take rely merely on enlightenment; those who do not know rely on the numinous. The enlightened are but tools of the numinous, while the numinous verifies all—this is why enlightenment cannot surpass the numinous. Yet fools, unaware of the numinous, rely solely on their own perceptions to impose upon others, expending effort externally. How can they return to the essence of life and destiny?

Yi Du’s commentary: The former kings established burial rites with coffins, outer coffins, clothing, and gold to conceal the body, fulfilling the devotion of a child—though they knew the spirit returns to heaven, the essence to earth, and the form transforms like a cicada’s molting into something else. As children, they could not bear otherwise, so the former kings accommodated human sentiment with ritual and decorum. Zhuangzi was not ignorant of the ancients’ intent in establishing rites, but in his time, ritual excesses led to competitive extravagance in burials, going beyond mere filial devotion. Thus, he spoke loftily to correct this, urging a return to fundamental simplicity. Taking heaven and earth as his coffin and outer coffin demonstrated his alignment with the Dao. All that falls under the Dao—all that has form and appearance—was at his command. Thus, the myriad things were at his disposal, yet he sought nothing. The perfected person’s self-conduct was thus; in dealing with others, the rites of the former kings remained. Whether the body is left above or below ground, it will inevitably be devoured by other beings. To snatch from one to give to another is still partiality. The sage preserves the spirit, not the form, for this reason. What seeks balance through imbalance fails to achieve balance; what seeks verification through unverified means fails to achieve verification. To balance the world through non-balance is to let the world balance itself, not through intent; to verify the world through non-verification is to let the world verify itself, not through intent. Where there is balance, there is imbalance; balance arises from imbalance, thus eliminating imbalance. Where there is verification, there is non-verification; verification arises from non-verification, thus eliminating non-verification. Only balance and verification are governed by the numinous, while the enlightened serve as its tools. The numinous is the Way of Heaven; enlightenment is the way of man. Thus, enlightenment cannot surpass the numinous. The world’s fools, relying on their own perceptions, use enlightenment to impose upon others, extinguishing their nature and expending effort externally while neglecting the internal—is this not lamentable?

Bixu’s commentary: The wealthy adorn coffins with jade disks, pearls, and jades, but to use the sun, moon, and stars as such—is this not already complete? To let crows, kites, ants, and mole crickets achieve balance is to avoid partiality; to snatch from one to give to another is imbalance. To impose one’s own views to balance the myriad things—how can they ever find balance?

To impose partial views upon the myriad movements—how can the myriad movements ever respond? Discernment creates distinction, and those who discern are thus enslaved; the numinous, however, is darkly boundless and empty, responding to all things without exception. Discernment has its limits, while the boundless knows no end—this is why enlightenment cannot surpass the numinous. Yet the world’s fools, relying on their own perceptions, pry into the hidden affairs of others, seize them as their own, expend effort externally without knowing to return inward—how the perfected sigh in lament!

Yuzhai’s commentary: This chapter satirizes the excesses of lavish burials in its time. To snatch from crows and kites to give to ants and mole crickets is partiality in perception. The principles of the myriad things are inherently balanced; if I impose an unbalanced mind to balance them, then what was balanced becomes unbalanced! The principles of things can be verified one by one; if I use an unverifiable mind to verify them, then what was verifiable becomes unverifiable. Originally, nothing compelled this, yet one assumes something compels it—this is to mistake the absence of intent for intent. The self-imposed burdens of the enlightened are ever thus. As for the numinous, it simply allows things to respond of themselves. "Enlightenment cannot surpass the numinous" means that intent cannot surpass non-action. Yet fools, relying on their private views to impose upon others, seek merit externally—how lamentable!

In ancient times, burials followed the natural contours of mountains, neither mounded nor marked with trees, neither exposing stench above nor reaching springs below, seeking only to conceal the form. Thus, the simplicity of coffins and shrouds, the austerity of funerary objects, may be known. Later generations, habituated to extravagance, adorned themselves in life with jade disks, pearls, and precious stones—already excessive—then used them to decorate coffins. The profusion of funerary objects, the grandeur of tombs and tunnels, need not be elaborated. This stems from those who, clinging to status and wealth, indulge in life’s luxuries, making it impossible to skimp on funerary rites. Surveying the lavish burials of antiquity—such as Tiger Hill or Mount Li—one finds they were deemed secure for ten thousand years, yet ultimately served only as treasure troves for great thieves.

Now, the disciples of Nanhua wish to bury their master with lavish rites—this too is a natural expression of human sentiment. Yet they still follow vulgar custom, hence the sigh: "I take heaven and earth as my coffin and bier!" How penetrating these words—unheard of in ancient times! The ideas of Yang Wangsun’s naked burial and Liu Bolun’s carrying of a spade both arise from this. Once the form is entrusted to the earth, how can crows, kites, ants, or mole crickets be avoided? In life, we originate from nothingness, yet externally, fleas and lice thrive, while internally, decay and dissolution transform us—all arising from our own existence. In death, like the cicada’s husk or the snake’s slough, we cast off the form and depart. The numinous, however, goes everywhere without exception—why then fear crows, kites, ants, or mole crickets?

Enlightenment refers to what is visible in form, yet it must rely on what is invisible within to govern it—moving when it wills to move, halting when it wills to halt. Within it lies constancy, which is what is meant by verification. Imbalance resides in form, for form differs in wealth and poverty, longevity and early death. Yet the numinous within humans is one. Observing things through the numinous, there is no imbalance; observing through form, imbalance arises. Verification is to strike and receive a response, to be moved and achieve resonance. If one views things with distrust, things will not trust in return.

Form inherently lacks verification; it takes verification from the numinous, seeking externally what lies within—thus, the internal is weighty, the external light. If one seeks verification from the external within the internal, then verification becomes non-verification, and balance becomes imbalance. The enlightened are made to serve, their actions limited; the numinous verifies, its tranquil essence boundless. Thus, it is said that enlightenment cannot surpass the numinous.

The Perfected One establishes this discourse not only to correct the excesses of lavish burials in his time but also to teach later scholars that what matters lies within, not without; what must be cultivated is the numinous, not the form. The source of balance and verification lies within, for the numinous and enlightenment temporarily depend on one another. If one can achieve this, one becomes one with heaven and earth. The argument that the sun, moon, and stars suffice as coffin ornaments, rendering pearls and jade excessive, is thus made.

The two Perfected Ones, Nanhua and Chongxu, appeared in their time to propagate the teaching, elevating the world to tranquility. Their enduring instructions have bestowed blessings across the ages. The two classics elucidate one another’s purport, and their excellence cannot be ranked. Yet this text begins with Liezi riding the wind, still dependent on something, while later passages cite it inconsistently. Some argue that with Zhuangzi’s talent, he could have galloped freely, forging his own marvels—why then follow Chongxu’s path?

I have examined the reasoning: all who possess virtue must express it in words, for words guide conduct. Those whose conduct aligns yet whose words differ do not exist. The ultimate in profound discourse is timeless, whether expressed directly or obliquely, through straightforward or paradoxical speech—all serve to illuminate the Dao. Nanhua delights in the excellence of former worthies, adopting entire passages to convey his own meaning in sixteen instances. The *Minghai* chapter of *Liezi* is quite brief, while *Zhuangzi* elaborates it in detail. Thus, in each chapter’s conclusion, one sees the indigo surpassing the plant, its brilliance redoubled. *Zhuangzi* is enriched by *Liezi*, while *Liezi* is further illuminated by *Zhuangzi*.

Earlier, the passage on riding the wind was seen as dependent on external means, judged by its traces; later, the subtlety of its words is grasped through the mind’s resonance. The final chapter is titled "Yu kou," clarifying that the citations are not concealed and that the ultimate purport aligns. Yet within this chapter, *Liezi*’s original text is scant—could this mark the beginning of Guo Xiang’s edits?

The matter of fermenting wine warns against deviating to impress others. Soon after, sandals filled the doorway, yet it could not prevent people from harboring reservations. Next, the dispute between Huan and Zhai, who died in fury and transformed into intertwined catalpa trees, fleeing naturalness to meet execution—this was the Creator’s retribution for violating their heavenly nature. To know the Dao is to be silent, like the heavens in their ceaseless motion...

To know and yet speak of it is to grasp but its shallow mechanism. Thus, one who masters the art of dragon-slaying finds no use for his skill, for mere skill cannot suffice to slay dragons. Those who lick ulcers to gain carriages receive more the more they lick—without excess, there is no way to honor their servility. All this serves to warn disciples and silence the ills of the age.

As for relying on steadfast pillars to prop up a state, it is better to cease such efforts. Realizing the punishment for overreaching action, the heart must grow more cautious. The nine signs are applied, yet the unworthy still attain them. Three summonses arrive, and reverence or disdain become clear. The eight directions and three necessities are not constant. A single pearl atop nine peaks is barely grasped.

This further illustrates the manifold ways of engaging the world and responding to things, as well as the calamities invited by chasing fame and pursuing profit. If one can take what has form and trace it back to that which has never yet become a thing, then the burdens of the human realm may be avoided. Forsaking the sacrificial ox to become a lone calf depends on whether one wholeheartedly believes and strives to practice.

The chapter concludes with the death of *Zhuangzi*, showing that illusory forms are not worth clinging to, for all things must come to an end. His disciples, fearing the crows and kites would feast on him, still viewed him through worldly eyes. Only the perfected person forgets form and follows transformation, free from partiality in giving or taking. Embracing spirit and employing clarity, they reveal the unerring nature of balanced signs—this is how they depart from the human and enter the celestial, ascending to the Dao in its fullness!

*Collected Subtleties of the Meaning of the Southern Florescence True Classic*, Scroll One Hundred Three

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu, studied the foremost Way in the world. Many have governed through methods and safeguards, all believing their achievements cannot be surpassed.

Where, then, does the ancient Way of safeguarding truly lie? It is said: nowhere it is not present. How does the numinous descend? How does clarity emerge? The sage is born, the king is accomplished—all originate from the One. Not departing from the Source is called the Heavenly Person; not departing from essence is called the Spirit Person; not departing from the real is called the Perfected Person.

Taking Heaven as the Source, virtue as the root, and the Dao as the gate, foretelling transformations—this is the sage. Taking benevolence as kindness, righteousness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony, suffused with compassion—this is the noble person. Taking law as distinction, name as outward form, integrity as verification, and examination as balance—its numbers being one, two, three, four—all officials rank accordingly. Taking affairs as constant, clothing and food as primary, multiplying and storing, caring for the aged, weak, orphaned, and widowed—all have means of sustenance: such is the governance of the people.

Were the ancients not complete? They matched the divine luminaries, harmonized with Heaven and Earth, nurtured the myriad things, brought harmony to the world, bestowed blessings upon the hundred clans, and illuminated the fundamental principles, linking them to secondary measures. The six connections and four openings, the great and the small, the refined and the coarse—its movement is nowhere absent.

Where its illumination lies in numerical measures, many remnants remain in old laws and transmitted histories. Where it lies in the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, scholars of Zou and Lu, and girdled masters, can often elucidate them: the *Odes* to guide the will, the *Documents* to guide affairs, the *Rites* to guide conduct, the *Music* to guide harmony, the *Changes* to guide yin and yang, and the *Spring and Autumn* to guide names and distinctions.

Its principles, dispersed throughout the world and established in the Central States, are sometimes praised and expounded by the hundred schools. When the world was in great disorder, worthies and sages were obscured, the Dao and virtue were not unified, and the world often grasped one insight to esteem itself. Like the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth, each has its clarity but cannot communicate with the others—just as the hundred schools and various arts each have their strengths and occasional uses.

Yet they are not comprehensive or broad, being partial scholars. They judge the beauty of Heaven and Earth, analyze the principles of the myriad things, and examine the completeness of the ancients, but few can fully embrace the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of the divine luminaries. Thus, the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship became obscured and unmanifest, and the people of the world each followed their desires to create their own methods. Alas! The hundred schools departed and did not return—they must not have been in accord!

Later scholars, unfortunately, did not see the purity of Heaven and Earth or the great essence of the ancients, and the arts of the Dao were torn asunder throughout the world.

Guo’s commentary: If one acts through having, then it is true action; if it is true action, there is no falsity—what more could be added? The divine luminaries descend and emerge only after being moved by affairs. If things each return to their root and embrace the One, without adornment on the outside, this is how sages and kings are born and accomplished.

The four names—Heavenly Person, Spirit Person, Perfected Person, and sage—are one in essence, differing only in how they are expressed. The seven principles of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are but the coarse edges of these four names, upheld by worthies and noble persons. The numerical measures of names, laws, integrity, and examination govern the people’s principles, which sages and worthies do not oppose.

The ancients, as in the four names above, illuminated the fundamental principles, so the secondary did not depart from them. Nowhere absent, they were thus complete. Though the numerical measures that can be illuminated are many, they are already external and coarse. One can only clarify their transmission—how could they be used to welcome the Way?

The *Six Classics* are dispersed throughout the world, all being the paths of sages and worthies, yet they are not often praised. Using them for advancement without unity, the world cannot avoid disorder, so illuminating the paths of sages and worthies is no easy task. The hundred schools, with their forced interpretations, each believe in their partial views and cannot embrace the whole.

The sage unifies the great sentiments of the hundred clans and establishes systems accordingly. The hundred clans entrust their sentiments to what is unified and forget their likes and dislikes, thus attaining tranquility with their generation. In chaos, they revert to it: people indulge their immediate preferences, families use their own codes, states have different policies, and households have distinct customs. Their strengths differ and cannot be constantly employed. Not sufficient to bear full responsibility, each uses but one partial aspect, thus dissecting the principles of the myriad things, obscuring the Way of the sage-kings, and making it rare to encounter a complete person.

The great essence of the ancients was to return to the root and embrace the One—this is the purity of Heaven and Earth. As the arts of the Dao declined, each promoted their own methods: some took things as primary, causing things to depart from their nature to follow their superiors, and the true conditions of life and destiny were lost.

Lü’s commentary: The hundred schools of the world all believe their methods and arts, when applied through action, cannot be surpassed. Since their methods differ, where, then, does the ancient art of the Dao lie? It is said: nowhere it is not present, but one cannot grasp its entirety. Without grasping its entirety, how can the divine luminaries descend and emerge? When the numinous descends, it is where the sage is born; when clarity emerges, it is where the king is accomplished. The One is the master of the divine luminaries.

The so-called Heavenly Person, Spirit Person, Perfected Person, sage, and noble person share the same great essence, differing only in how they are expressed. Speaking of the Dao, one first clarifies Heaven, for Heaven is what is revered. Thus, not departing from the Source is called the Heavenly Person. Essence enters the numinous; without reality, one does not attain it. The sage fully embodies the utmost of Heaven and spirit, thus unifying the Dao and virtue to foretell transformations—this is the numinous descending to become the sage. When it is seen in benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music, suffused with compassion, it is called the noble person—this is clarity emerging to become the king.

From the sage upward, they are one with Heaven; from the sage downward, they are one with humanity. By law they are divided, yet it may not be transgressed; by name they are distinguished, yet it may not be confused; by conduct they are tested, yet it may not be deceived; by verification they are ordered, yet it may not be deluded. In all these, there is a numerical principle at work: those with greater numbers hold higher positions and wield greater influence, while those with fewer occupy lower ranks and govern lesser affairs. The ranks of the hundred officials are determined by this alone.

Above, it is where the sage is born; below, it is where the king is accomplished. None is left unprepared, and thus they can match the divine luminaries, purify Heaven and Earth, nurture the myriad things, and harmonize all under Heaven. Clarifying the fundamental numbers without doubt, linking the peripheral measures without loss—this Way is not confined by the Six Directions, and its movement is present everywhere. Such was the great essence of the arts of the Dao in antiquity.

As for that which is called the numinous, it cannot be reckoned by numbers nor measured by degrees; it cannot be transmitted through written words. What is manifest in numbers and measures is the domain of officials, who enact its laws, and of state historians, who record its traces. As for what lies in the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, the scholars of Zou and Lu are largely able to clarify it. Refining the *Odes* unifies the Way and perfects the will; guiding with the *Spring and Autumn* directs names and duties—all are manifestations of the ancient arts of the Dao, clear and present in numbers and measures. The former kings applied these numbers to governance, dispersing them throughout the world, and the various schools of their time spoke of the Dao, yet none strayed beyond the bounds of the ancient arts.

When all under Heaven is well-ordered, the sage’s wisdom shines, and the Dao and virtue are one. Scholars perceive its wholeness and are not obscured by strange methods or heterodox arts. But when the world falls into chaos, each grasps but a single aspect, examining it to indulge their own preferences. Though each may have its strengths, none is comprehensive or all-encompassing—they are but partial scholars.

Heaven and Earth possess great beauty, yet it is divided; the myriad things have their inherent principles, yet they are dissected. Examining them through the completeness of the ancients, the hundred schools rarely embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of the divine luminaries. Thus, the Way of the sage-kings, though integral, is no longer illuminated. Each pursues what they desire, and the arts of the Dao are torn asunder across the world.

**Duyi’s Note:** The arts of the Dao are present everywhere; the arts of methods have their place. The essence of the Dao is omnipresent, and its function is never absent. Some call it the numinous, some call it clarity; some call it the sage, some call it the king. It descends or emerges, is born or accomplished—does it truly have a fixed locus? The numinous is the repository of clarity; clarity is the manifestation of the numinous. The sage is the legacy of the king; the king is the transformation of the sage. Roaming in the One, harmoniously fused and unified, without gaps—like the four seasons, each distinct yet together accomplishing the year’s work.

Whether called Heavenly Person, Spirit Person, Perfected Person, sage, or noble person, the hundred officials—though their roots and branches, essence and coarse forms differ—all do not depart from the One alone. That which emerges and has form is the root, born yet not coarse; that which is refined is essence. The true is the utmost of essence and sincerity, uniting with Heaven’s power and penetrating the Dao. These four—sage, king, and so on—are neither identical nor distinct, entering and exiting through different paths. When the sage emerges to become the noble person, the Dao and virtue disperse to become transformative righteousness; rites and music further disperse to become laws, names, conduct, and verification, equipping the hundred officials—these are but the remnants of the noble person.

The sage disperses the Dao to extend its use, hence there are laws; disperses the same to establish distinctions, hence there are divisions. The hundred officials grasp the laws but do not reach the Dao; they speak of divisions but do not attain its function. Names are the guests of reality; outward signs are the exterior of the inner. The hundred officials fulfill names but do not exhaust reality; they fulfill outward signs but do not reach the inner. What they grasp is conduct, verified in externals; what they verify is wisdom, decisively manifesting in outcomes. Their numbers—one, two, three, four—are the implements of names and laws.

Vessels have sizes, knowledge has scopes, and thus the hundred officials are ranked accordingly. Taking affairs as the norm and clothing and food as the priority, they nurture the people. Through transformation, the people multiply; through governance, they accumulate wealth. The old, weak, orphaned, and widowed are provided for; the divine luminaries and Heaven and Earth are matched. Then they nurture the myriad things, allowing them to follow their natures, and harmonize all under Heaven, so that it responds in season and its blessings flow to the hundred clans.

The fundamental numbers speak of essence; the peripheral measures speak of the coarse. Clarity linked to these—this is how the Dao is complete and present everywhere. What is subtle and lies in nature and destiny may be transmitted through the mind’s method; what cannot be transmitted may be possessed within oneself. What history cannot record, yet is clear and within numbers and measures, the *Odes* and *Documents*—these are the domain of officials and scholar-officials who can clarify them. The *Six Classics* each have their guiding principles, yet all converge in governance.

The Lao-Zhuang school’s rejection of benevolence and righteousness sought to correct excess and return to uprightness. But overcorrection leads back to error. Thus, here the *Six Classics* of the sage alone are invoked to rectify the prior overcorrection. The *Six Classics* were divided, and the hundred schools each affirmed their own truths, causing the arts of the Dao to lose their clarity. Those who spoke of the Dao in their time could not embody it in their hearts, leading to the obscuring of the sagely and worthy. The Dao and virtue, though two, were not one. Each pursued their own desires, prizing their private insights as wisdom and their private preferences as benevolence. Thus, few could embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of the divine luminaries. In the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship, they surely did not succeed.

**Bixu’s Note:** The various methods of the world each form a school, seeking utility in the age—where then is the Dao? This speaks of the pure and refined having departed, leaving only the dregs. Yet the numinous descends and clarity emerges through the possession of the Dao; the sage is born and the king is accomplished—not by two separate paths. Taking the profound and obscure as their foundation, they are the Heavenly Person.

The pure and unadulterated is the spirit-person; the guardian of the true without falsity is the perfected-person. As for those who take the principle of spontaneity as their foundation, base themselves on the merit of non-virtue, traverse the path of emptiness and penetration, and evade the subtleties of the numinous—these are the sage-rulers of the age, who encompass the three ranks above. Next are the noblemen and the hundred officials who govern the world with benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music, their demeanor warmly kind and harmonious, their grace extending to the myriad things. They establish laws to define duties, confer titles to manifest character and conduct, observe conduct to verify talent and ability, and examine seniority to order promotions and demotions—all governed by arts and methods.

When the Dao is insufficient, laws are employed; when laws are insufficient, arts are employed; when arts are insufficient, discretion is employed; when discretion is insufficient, power is employed. When power is insufficient, one returns to discretion; discretion returns to arts, arts return to laws, and laws return to the Dao—where the Dao is, there is non-action and self-transformation. Arts are the sovereign’s secret instruments, not to be rashly glimpsed by subordinates; power is the sharp tool for controlling things, not to be rashly wielded by subordinates. If the sovereign possesses arts yet ministers glimpse them, they are not the profoundest arts; if the sovereign possesses power yet ministers act wrongly, it is not the weightiest power. The key lies first in rectifying names and duties, ensuring no encroachment or usurpation—only then can arts be applied and power monopolized.

The hundred officials rank themselves by office, yet this does not exceed the sequence of one, two, three, four. The categories of laws, names, conduct, and examinations are used to teach and nurture the myriad people, ensuring none lose their livelihood. In the age of great antiquity, there were no laws yet all was complete—not because laws were set up to complete it. When one matches the divine luminaries, ghosts emit no numinous echoes; when one harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, the four seasons remain constant; when one nurtures the myriad things, the harvests are ever abundant; when one harmonizes the world, people suffer no premature misfortune. Thus, benevolence extends to grasses and trees, and trust reaches even pigs and fish—all stems from illuminating the root principles and binding the branch measures.

The ruler practices non-action and is revered—this is the root principle, the Way of Heaven, the division of duties. The minister acts and is burdened—this is the branch measure, the Way of Earth, the source of scrutiny. The distinction between root and branch lies solely in careful discernment. This Dao is unimpeded, penetrating the six directions and opening the four quarters. From the tiniest hairs of Heaven and Earth to the spirits, forms, and vessels, in all their shifts and transformations, nothing enters into the realm of the unquestioned.

As for the principles found in yin-yang, pitch standards, the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, their methods spread throughout the world, and the hundred schools of learning occasionally invoke them. Yet when their simplicity scatters and the age’s Way collapses, each clings to their own preferences, unable to mutually employ one another. Thus, the Way of sage-kings dims, and people each pursue what they praise, drifting ever farther from the Dao. The fragmentation of the Dao and its arts is the misfortune of scholars.

**Luan Qi’s Note:** In the final chapter, Zhuangzi discusses the learning of past and present, much like the final chapter of the *Mencius*, which speaks of "hearing knowledge" and "seeing knowledge." From the beginning of the chapter to "the Dao and its arts will be torn asunder," this serves as the overarching preface. It then follows the various schools of thought, including his own work among them. The learning of Zou and Lu was misled by this general preface, revealing that even this elder, though his writings often contain contentious words, never failed to recognize the learning of the Confucian school as orthodox. People all regard their own learning as unsurpassable, each claiming their own rightness.

The ancient arts of the Dao share the same characters as "arts of transformation" and "arts of the mind." Where do they reside? Nowhere they are not present—this conveys the idea of being within the times. Though learning may differ, the Dao is present in all. How do the numinous descend and clarity emerge? The birth of sages and the accomplishment of kings—this is the principle of Heaven and Earth’s generation and completion, all originating from the One. The One refers to creation. "Foundation," "essence," and "truth" all align with the character "One," though the phrasing varies. From "taking Heaven as the foundation" to "taking the Dao as the gate," all express the meaning of non-action and spontaneity. Traced to their transformations, they originate from the One.

"Warmly kind and benevolent" describes their demeanor. Laws have distinctions; names have standards; their verifications and sequences each have their basis. "One, two, three, four" speaks to their meticulous clarity and completeness. Taking clothing and food as primary, teaching the people to focus on farming and sericulture, caring for the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed—these are the roots of enacting governance and extending benevolence. The four phrases beginning with "matching the divine luminaries" describe the vastness of its efficacy. Root and branch refer to essence and coarse detail. "Penetrating the six directions and opening the four quarters" means there is no application where it does not suffice.

The sequence of the *Six Classics* clearly refers to Confucius. When scattered into the hundred schools and myriad arts, the world grasps but one aspect and clings to it, boasting of their own discernment—like eyes and ears unable to communicate, leaving them incomplete before Heaven, Earth, and the divine luminaries. Inner sageliness is the substance; outer kingship is the function. When the Way of inner and outer is unclear, people each pursue their desires, creating their own arts, lost and unable to return. The phrase "the Dao and its arts will be torn asunder" concludes with great force.

This chapter begins by discussing the scholars of the time, each devoted to their own abilities, regarding their applications as unsurpassable, unaware of the wondrous principle of non-action and spontaneity—thus drifting far from the Dao. Where, then, do the ancient arts of the Dao truly reside? They are present everywhere. Later people, creating their own methods, interpose barriers, leading to differences between states and divergence among schools, flowing into the arts of the various schools.

The arts of the Dao serve to match the divine luminaries and enact governance, enrich customs and connect with the conditions of things, guiding the people without their awareness, leading to self-transformation. The sage-rulers of high antiquity, with hands folded and non-action, oversaw the flourishing of the people—this was the descent of the numinous and the emergence of clarity, responding to affairs as they arose, acting without acting. The birth of sages and the accomplishment of kings are the effects of the numinous in its transformations. From "not departing from the foundation" to "being called a sage" is how one completes Heaven—this is the work of the sage, wherein the divine resides.

From "taking benevolence as grace" to "being called a gentleman" is how one completes humanity—this is the work of the king, wherein the Way is manifested in governance. Thus, it is spoken of in terms of inner and outer.

Next are laws, names, numbers, and measures, as well as the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*—all instruments of the former kings’ governance, which require the right people to implement them. The Way, when matched with the divine luminaries, can purify Heaven and Earth; virtue, when nurturing the myriad things, can harmonize the world.

The root-number is what is called the One. All beyond the One are but branches. The sage’s arising takes the One as its root; the king’s accomplishment relies on the Two to achieve completion. Root and branch depend on each other, and the Way of governance is thus complete.

The governance of the ancient sage-kings was meticulous, their concern for the people profound. They sought not merely to order their own time but to establish models for ten thousand generations. From the cultivation of the Way’s intent to the clarification of names and duties—all are the traces of the sage’s attainment of governance.

When applied to the world, their effects vary in depth, and their manifestations in affairs and governance differ in order and disorder. This arises from the obscurity of the sagely and worthy’s guidance, the divergence in the return to the Way and virtue. Scholars merely prize the withered straw dogs of the past, and governance fails to reach its potential, giving rise to portents and anomalies. Each grasps but a single aspect and mistakes it for the whole, no different from mistaking a hoofprint’s puddle for the Eastern Sea.

The great beauty of Heaven and Earth cannot be fully realized without the Way; the forms and appearances of the divine luminaries cannot be fittingly expressed without virtue. How could those who devise their own methods ever attain this?

The closing lines are impassioned in meaning, revealing that the *Nanhua*’s intent aligns with that of the Master—how timely its admonition! "Action must not be forced," and in the phrase below, *wei* (為) should alternate with *zi* (字). "Desire" here likely means "desire to act," as the context makes clear.

The Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu, ranked second under heaven, neither vaunting himself before posterity nor indulging in the myriad things, nor dazzling through numerical measures, yet hewed to the marking-line to rectify himself and met the world’s urgent needs. Among the ancient arts of the Dao were those who held to such principles—Mo Di and Qin Guli, who heard of their ethos and rejoiced in it. Yet they carried it to excess, while Mozi himself adhered to its grand cycle.

They composed *Against Music*, calling it *Frugality*, forbidding song in life and mourning in death. Mozi’s universal love and mutual benefit led to strife, yet his Dao did not incite anger. He was fond of learning and broad in knowledge, neither differing from others nor aligning with the former kings. The Yellow Emperor had *Xianchi*, Yao had *Dazhang*, Shun had *Dashao*, Yu had *Daxia*, Tang had *Dahu*, King Wen had the music of the *Biyong*, and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou composed *Wu*. In ancient mourning rites, the noble and base had their proper forms, the high and low their distinctions: the Son of Heaven had seven layers of inner and outer coffins, the feudal lords five, great officers three, and scholars two. Yet Mozi alone forbade song in life and mourning in death, using only a paulownia coffin three inches thick without an outer casket, setting this as the model. Teaching others thus, he surely did not love them; practicing it himself, he surely did not love himself. This ultimately undermined Mozi’s Dao.

Though he sang yet not as song, wept yet not as weeping, rejoiced yet not as joy—was this truly fitting? His life was toilsome, his death meager, his Dao extreme. He made others anxious, made them sorrowful; his conduct was difficult to follow. I fear this cannot be the Dao of the sage, for it runs counter to the hearts of all under heaven. The world cannot bear it, and though Mozi alone could endure it, what could he do for the world? Estranged from all under heaven, he was far removed from the kingly way.

Mozi spoke of the Dao, saying: "In ancient times, Yu stemmed the floodwaters, dredged the rivers and streams to connect the four barbarians and the nine provinces. There were three hundred great rivers, three thousand tributaries, and countless smaller ones. Yu personally wielded the plowshare, gathering the nine kinds of earth to dam the waters. His shins were bare of flesh, his calves devoid of hair; he bathed in torrential rains, combed his hair in fierce winds, and established the myriad measures. Yu was a great sage, yet he toiled his body for the world to such an extent."

Thus, later Mohists wore coarse garments of felt and hemp, bound their feet in sandals, and labored day and night without rest, taking self-affliction as the ultimate principle. They said: "If one cannot do this, it is not the Dao of Yu, and one is unworthy to be a Mohist." The disciples of Xiangli Qin, the followers of Wu Hou, and the southern Mohists such as Ku Huo, Ji Chi, and Deng Lingzi’s group all recited the *Mo Jing*, yet their interpretations diverged and twisted, calling one another "heterodox Mohists." They debated the paradoxes of *jian bai* and *tong yi*, reviled one another with sophistry, and responded with forced analogies and unnatural arguments.

The Mohists revered their *juzi* as sages, all wishing to serve as their embodiment, hoping to become their successors—this practice has endured without end. Mo Di and Qin Guli’s intentions were sound, yet their conduct was misguided. They sought to compel later Mohists to advance by emulating Yu’s self-mortification—bare calves and hairless sinews. This is the height of disorder and the nadir of governance.

Nevertheless, Mozi was truly one who loved the world’s welfare, so much so that even if he withered away, he would not abandon his pursuit. What a man of talent he was!

**Guo’s Annotation:** Diligence and frugality lead to exhaustion, hence no radiance. Yet with resources in surplus, one is prepared for emergencies. Overzealous adherence to extremes, however, exceeds what the masses can bear. Scarcity breeds strife; when the people are made to toil frugally yet remain in surplus, conflict is deemed wrong. Not through anger, but through self-denial. Believing themselves right, they seek to make all things conform to their own way. The former kings indulged the diversity of their people, then harmonized them all, unaware of how they achieved this. They abolished ancient rites and music, deeming them extravagant and wasteful. All things should be loved by exerting effort and following nature’s inclinations; now, by taking frugality as the law and overdoing it, they claim to enrich the world—yet this is no true love. Mozi alone perfected his Dao while rejecting the Dao of virtue. Disregarding the natural dispositions of the myriad things, his Way was barren and devoid of nourishment, imposing sorrow and hardship, making it unfit for the sagely path. The sagely Way allows each person to find joy in their nature, and thus the world encounters no difficulty. Therefore, a true king must align with the world’s joy and progress alongside all things. Mozi merely saw Yu’s physical toil and failed to perceive the harmony of his nature, taking self-affliction as the ultimate principle. Clinging to his Dao out of season, this is what it means to be a Mohist. Yet even among the Mohists, factions arose. The *juzi* excelled in distinguishing right from wrong to perfect their conduct. All wished to become their leader, to uphold their teachings, intending to avoid extravagance and prepare for the world’s emergencies—this was their justification. But in overdoing it, they erred.

No disorder is greater than opposing the nature of things and harming their essence, hence this is the lowest form of governance. Their genuine admiration for sages and worthies was not misplaced, yet it cannot be taught to others. To seek such men in vain, to find no equal in the world, to persist in emaciation without surrender—this is what makes them truly devoted men of talent, not men of virtue.

**Lü’s Annotation:** The governance of the former kings reached its perfection in the grandeur of culture and institutions, yet they did not indulge in extravagance for posterity, nor wastefulness toward the myriad things, nor radiance in excessive regulations—this was not their constant way. Using the carpenter’s line to correct themselves, they prepared for the world’s emergencies; this was one aspect of the ancient arts of the Dao. The Dao embodies constancy while embracing all change, but Mozi saw only the need to prepare for emergencies and took it as the norm. This is what is meant by grasping one aspect and scrutinizing it to one’s own satisfaction—it cannot be shared with others. From his *Against Music* to his *Universal Love Without Distinction*, all were taken to extremes, reflecting his own excessive adherence. The former sages established moderation in rites and music, and proper forms for mourning and burial. Yet Mozi forbade singing in life and mourning in death, rejecting the former kings and abolishing ancient rites and music. His frugality and austerity were thus extreme—not only did he fail to love others, but he also failed to love himself.

Mozi’s original intent was universal love and mutual benefit, yet he did not consider whether people could endure the bitterness of his austerity. Few lost their way, so his Dao did not collapse. Joy and sorrow are inescapable for humanity; the former sages gave them form and measure. Mozi, however, forbade singing yet condemned singing, forbade weeping yet condemned weeping—was this truly in accord with human nature? To toil in life and be sparing in death imposes sorrow and grief. Though some aspects of the ancient arts of the Dao lay in this, Mozi took it too far—it cannot be called the sagely Way. Even if he could endure it, what of the world’s inability to bear it? He strayed far from the kingly Way.

In the past, Yu faced the great flood and labored to such an extent—this was a response to the world’s emergency. Mozi took it as the norm, which was wrong. The intent to toil and prepare for the world’s needs was commendable, but in overdoing it, he made his conduct unbearable for the world. This is not how to compel later scholars to advance through self-affliction. Frugality and diligence are indeed difficult to practice, yet Mozi excelled at them—truly a man who loved the world’s welfare, one who cannot be found even when sought. What a man of talent he was!

**Yi Du’s Annotation:** After the great Dao was lost, the various masters emerged in succession—men like Mo Di and Guli, Song Keng and Yin Wen—culminating in the likes of Hui Shi, who debated in thousands of words. Zhuangzi refuted and dismissed them, leaving them hollow. The Mohist teachings emphasized hardship, frugality, and austerity, condemning ease, pleasure, extravagance, and waste. Thus, they rejected radiant regulations and used the carpenter’s line to correct themselves, sufficiently preparing for the world’s emergencies while ensuring surplus resources. Mo Di’s followers, hearing of this, were delighted. Yet in fully embracing it, they went too far; in fully adhering to it, they were too rigid.

Forbidding singing in life, he wrote *Against Music*; taking frugality as the Way, he allowed no mourning in death. His Dao sought to ensure sufficiency for all and eliminate strife, so through self-denial, he did not grow angry. Fond of learning and seeking to make all things conform to himself, he thus rejected distinctions. To toil in life and be sparing in death, to abolish ancient rites and music, to reject the ways of the former kings—from the Yellow Emperor’s *Xianchi* to the Duke of Zhou’s *Wu*, he condemned their singing in life. From the ancient mourning rites to the double-layered garments of scholars, he condemned their mourning in death. Though his Dao had not yet collapsed, it was bound to fail. To forbid singing yet condemn singing, to forbid weeping yet condemn weeping—was this truly in accord with human nature? Who alone perfected Mohism while opposing the natural dispositions of the myriad things? His Way was vast and desolate, making it difficult for people to follow. He strayed far from the former kings.

The former kings shared the people’s breath, grounding their Way in human nature, not aiming for difficulty but desiring the world to be as they were.

Once, Yu tamed the floodwaters, dredging the Yangtze and the Yellow River. He wielded the plow and spade himself, enduring wind and rain, his body toiling for the world in such a manner. Later generations emulated him, taking self-affliction as the ultimate virtue. Yet Yu’s Way was not Mohism—only the corruption of its transmission gave rise to what we call Mohism.

Xiangli Qin, Denglingzi, and their followers all recited the *Mo Jing* yet diverged in their interpretations, splitting the same school into different factions. They debated to disparage one another, responded with sophistry, and regarded the most eloquent as sages, eager to become their successors in hopes of transmitting the teachings. Mozi’s frugality, preparedness, and restraint were sound, but his excess in self-affliction was not. In discourse on chaos, he stood above; in discourse on order, he fell below. Truly, he sought what the world desired, yet no likeness could be found. Mozi’s talent approached Yu’s, but his Way strayed far from Yu’s, and thus could not avoid corruption, reducing it to mere Mohism.

*Bixu’s Commentary*: The Mohist teaching rejects extravagance and ostentation, emphasizing diligence, frugality, and self-discipline to address the world’s crises. Yet its parsimony was excessive—what he could endure, the multitude could not follow. Rejecting music, restricting expenditures, mourning lightly in life and meagerly in death—this was truly contrary to human nature! Nevertheless, its universal love approached benevolence, its mutual benefit approached righteousness, its non-aggression approached wisdom, and its non-anger approached knowledge. Moreover, its love of learning and advocacy for unity set it apart from common customs. Where it diverged from the former kings, its condemnation of ancient rites and music was most severe.

From the *Xianchi* to the *Wu*, from layered coffins to elaborate mourning garments—these were the rites and music of antiquity. Mozi, however, forbade singing in life—how much more so silk and bamboo music? He forbade mourning in death—how much more so pearls and jade! To practice this oneself was unnatural; to teach it to others was too harsh, inevitably leading to the corruption of perverse and unprincipled deviations. Human singing, weeping, laughter, and joy arise from innate emotions—yet he rejected and abolished them all, making it unlike the world’s nature. Barren and desolate, it brought sorrow and grief, which the multitude could not bear, though Mozi alone could endure it. Since it did not accord with the world’s nature, it strayed far from the kingly Way.

Mozi revered Yu’s diligence and frugality, praising his achievement in flood control. "Nine times he dredged the world’s rivers," meaning he cleared the rivers of the Nine Provinces without obstruction. "His calves bore no flesh, his shins no hair"—all recorded in the *Book of Documents*—yet he did not reach the subtlety of the original Way. Later generations emulated him, taking self-affliction as the ultimate virtue, even to the point of cutting their flesh or severing their limbs to seek blessings. This was another corruption of Mohist learning. Xiangli Qin and his followers were those who led Mohism to ruin. They regarded the most eloquent and erudite as teachers, eventually falling into the corruption of empty debate and competitive argument. While their diligence, frugality, and preparedness were commendable, teaching others through suffering was not—how could order be expected when later generations emulated its chaos?

Yet their love of learning was earnest, unmatched in the world. Their determination in study and resolve in teaching rivaled Confucius—truly the finest of scholars! Only their conduct strayed from the true path of virtue and power.

*Juanzhai’s Note*: They did not teach later generations extravagance, hence their lack of adornment. They did not measure all things by rites, music, or standards, restraining themselves to correct the world, desiring that the world’s resources be sufficient. They argued that people’s struggles arose from insufficient clothing and food. Later Mohists, however, suppressed too severely. *Fei Le* ("Against Music") and *Jie Yong* ("Moderation in Use") are chapters in the *Mozi*. They condemned warfare as wrong and rejected anger as a Way. "Broadening without divergence" meant expanding their doctrine to advocate unity. Teaching people to love themselves yet failing in both respects—this was not in accord with human nature, hence "unlike."

Great simplicity—its practice was difficult. It went against the world’s heart, yet Mozi alone found peace in it. Since it did not align with human hearts, it could not bring kingly rule to the world. Mozi extolled the Way to the point of toiling the body for the world, thus emulating Yu’s achievements. "Nine" is read as *sijiu*, meaning "gathering laborers to work together." To call odd and even the same was forced sophistry. The *Juzi* were the great masters of Mohist learning. "Sought but not found" means no such person remained. Though they pushed themselves to the point of emaciation, they did not cease—truly heroic scholars!

They did not indulge in extravagance among the myriad things, nor did they seek brilliance in rites and ceremonies. Diligent, frugal, and disciplined, they prepared for the world’s crises—this was Yu’s conduct as seen in the world. Mo Di and Hua Li, hearing of it, were delighted, yet they carried it too far, making it arduous and difficult to practice, too rigid in discipline, leaving them barren and unnatural. They composed *Fei Le* and *Jie Yong* to teach the world: no singing in life, no mourning in death—these were the manifestations of their rejection of music and restriction of use. Universal love aimed at mutual benefit; non-aggression aimed at non-anger—these were not without virtue. Their love of learning and pursuit of breadth, their desire for unity, still betrayed a competitive

To apply the response to constancy is like binding and cauterizing oneself when ill—it only deepens the wound’s pain; what could be more foolish? The followers of Xiangli Qin, claiming to be a distinct branch of Mohism, vied to criticize and outdo one another, elevating those who perfected their craft as sages. The *Juzi*—akin to the Confucians’ "great scholars"—all aspired to succeed them, and this succession continues to this day. This reflects a division within Mohism: while Mo Di and Qin Guli carried forward the earlier tradition, their intent in teaching self-denial was misguided. They sowed chaos rather than order, and where they brought governance, it was but a lesser defense.

Yet Mozi’s true nature was unmatched in his love for the world, and though his teachings took root in his time, they were not the Dao of the sages. Still, he may be called a man of talent. Mencius, in refuting Yang Zhu and Mo Di as deviating from the sages’ Dao, used stern words and vehement opposition, as if they were mortal enemies—this reveals the urgency of defending the true Way. *Nanhua* (Zhuangzi) meticulously examined the deeds of the Mohists and their origins, exposing their flaws while acknowledging their strengths. This may be called impartial judgment tempered with forbearance. Though he did not explicitly address Yangism, his intent was clear.

Mohism traced its roots to Yu the Great, Yangism to Lao Dan—both emerged from the sages’ school, yet their learning was partial. Like Zengzi and Zisi, who studied under Confucius but erred by excess or deficiency, these were but offshoots of Yang and Mo. Thus, one must be prudent in learning. Unburdened by convention, unadorned by things, uncompromising with others, unyielding to the crowd, they wished for the world’s peace to preserve lives. In nurturing oneself and others, they sought only sufficiency and no more, thereby purifying the heart.

Among the ancient arts of the Dao, there were those who embodied this. Song Jian and Yin Wen, inspired by their example, crafted the *Huashan* cap as a symbol of their way. In engaging with the myriad things, they began by dispelling prejudices. They spoke of the heart’s capacity, calling it "the heart’s conduct." Through harmony, they sought concord; through regulation, they aimed to pacify the world, proposing to establish this as the guiding principle. To endure insult without shame, to rescue states from peril, to ban aggression and halt warfare—these were their means of saving the world from strife.

With this, they traversed the world, persuading rulers above and instructing the people below. Though the world did not embrace their teachings, they persisted relentlessly, hence the saying: "They were met with disdain yet forced their presence." Nevertheless, their concern for others was excessive, while their care for themselves was scant. They declared: "Five measures of rice are enough." The master feared hunger, yet the disciples, though starving, never forgot the world, laboring day and night without rest. They proclaimed: "We must survive!"—how could they not be hailed as saviors of the age? They said: "The noble person does not indulge in petty scrutiny nor lend themselves to things. What brings no benefit to the world is better left undone than forced."

Externally, they sought to ban aggression and halt warfare; internally, they advocated minimal desires. Their teachings, whether grand or subtle, refined or coarse, extended only this far. Guo Xiang’s commentary: *Zhi* means opposition. "Sufficiency and no more" meant no desire for excess. *Huashan*, level above and below, symbolized their conduct. To "dispel prejudices" was to prevent mutual transgressions. They strove to harmonize and reconcile through their Dao. The two masters proposed that such principles be established as the world’s foundation.

"To endure insult without shame" was their urgent means of preserving lives. "Rescuing from conflict and halting warfare" was their method of harmony. Though the world rejected them, they persisted relentlessly—this was the principle of harmony. "Met with disdain yet forcing their presence" was their way of enduring without shame. If they did not allow natural transformation but forced consolation, their efforts would be too burdensome. "Five measures of rice" made clear their minimal self-regard.

Song Jian and Yin Wen addressed the world as "masters" and called themselves "disciples." They labored day and night for the people, expecting reciprocity. "How could they not be hailed?"—this describes their lofty and expansive demeanor. "Not indulging in petty scrutiny" meant practicing forbearance. "Not lending themselves to things" meant exerting their own strength. What brought no benefit to the world was abandoned—this defined their role as saviors. Their conduct extended only this far, unable to traverse the vast and empty.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: Unburdened by convention, unadorned by things, extending sincerity to others, enduring disgrace without contention, wishing for the world’s peace and sufficiency without seeking excess—if their hearts harbored discord, they cleansed it as impurity, thus purifying the heart. The world’s conflicts arise from mutual encroachment and harshness; to dispel prejudices is to end strife and desire peace. The heart of the Dao embraces all, leaving no room for contention.

The two masters spoke of its capacity and conducted themselves with humility to foster harmony, aiming to pacify the world—this was "the heart’s conduct." They wished to establish it as the foundation, revering and upholding it. From "enduring insult without shame" to "persisting relentlessly," this was their way of harmony. Though the ancient arts of the Dao included such teachings, their excessive concern for others and minimal care for themselves led Song and Yin to diverge. They declared: "We labor day and night to save the world, yet if people do not revere us as saviors and ignore us, how can we survive? We need not fear starvation." Their conduct extended only this far; beyond this, they knew nothing—meaning they had not grasped the Dao.

Yi Du’s commentary: To be free from worldly burdens, unadorned by things, at ease with others without harshness, yielding to the crowd without arrogance, wishing for the world’s peace and sufficiency—Song and Yin’s Dao differed slightly from Mo Di’s, hence they followed after him. Their legacy endured, and later generations, inspired by their example, crafted the *Huashan* cap as a symbol of their way.

To engage with the myriad things, one begins by distinguishing between the vast and the small, setting boundaries for each. Yet the Dao of the sage treats self and others as one body, making no such distinctions—vast and small share the same realm, with no need for confinement. What they accommodate is for progress; what they practice is not of their own heart. The two masters spoke of the heart’s capacity and called its actions the heart’s conduct. Their aspiration was the world’s peace, so they sought harmony through unity, regulating all within the seas. They proposed establishing a ruler, and all wished to serve as his proxy, their intentions aligned.

To endure insult without shame, to persist in clamor without ceasing—these were their own excesses. They flattered their lords above and instructed the people below, revealing an overabundance of concern for others. To endure insult without shame, yet be content with a mere five *sheng* of rice—this showed too little care for themselves. They schemed for pride, expanded their reach, and took saving the world as their task. Yet to excel in seven things without adaptability is insufficient to establish true principle. The two masters exceeded in transformation but fell short in principle. The noble person does not engage in harsh scrutiny; their words and efforts arise from their own strength.

If an act brings no benefit to the world, examining it is no better than abandoning it—yet they still sought to save the world. Externally, they advocated for the cessation of war; internally, they sought to diminish desires. Though their methods varied in refinement and scale, their conduct extended only this far. Bi Xu’s commentary: Without attachment, one is unburdened; in simplicity, one is unadorned; in directness, one is uncompromising; in yielding, one does not rely on force. Wishing the world peace and sufficiency without excess—clarifying this heart is all there is to it. The *Huashan* cap symbolizes the heart’s steadfast uprightness, governing with the evenness of a summit, distinguishing the worthy from the foolish, and taking leniency and law as the foundation of governance—yet their words and deeds never faltered.

When laws are lenient and harmonious, they align with the people’s hearts; the world praises them and joyfully elevates such a one as ruler. Enduring humiliation to halt strife, they made the people cease contention. Cessation of war, upholding kindness, the people embraced tranquility—with this, they persuaded the world, ensuring the people would follow and desire peace and life. This was their overabundance of concern for others. Austere and frugal, they endured hardship, offering but five *sheng* of rice daily, yet still deferring to their teachers, preferring their own hunger over forgetting the world—this was their too little care for themselves.

*"Must I surely live?"*—they said, *"I strive to save others, so Heaven must preserve me."* *"Scheming for pride?"*—they did not scheme for pride, nor did they seek the empty fame of saving the world for vainglory. Not engaging in harsh scrutiny, they focused on self-mastery. Without lending themselves to things, they led by force of action. They refrained from all that brought no benefit to the world, externally harmonizing and regulating human affairs without contention, internally restraining desires to temper their nature. Though matters differed in refinement, they merely removed what was unreasonable and acted accordingly—this was the ultimate principle of governance.

Juan Zhai’s notes: *"Adornment"* refers to self-indulgence; *"resentment"* is human nature. *"Distinguishing confinement"* means being at ease within one’s lot—*"distinction"* is following one’s portion, *"confinement"* is resting in contentment. *"Capacity"* refers to essence; *"conduct"* refers to function. They sought to unite people’s joy through harmony, to regulate all within the seas, proposing to establish a ruler. Persisting in clamor without ceasing, they wearied others with their ceaseless boasting. Daily, they had but five *sheng* of rice, shared among teacher and disciples—even the master went hungry, let alone the disciples! Enduring hunger and hardship, laboring day and night without rest—how could this be a path to long life? Yet they did so to correct those who feigned saving the world for personal gain.

*"Scheming for pride"*—they sought to rectify this, like Yu Rang, who said: *"I undertake this utmost difficulty to shame all those ministers who harbor disloyalty."* Their teaching also said: Do not engage in harsh scrutiny, abandon the distinction between self and others, act for oneself without relying on others’ strength. Knowing that assisting the world in futile matters is better left undone, they still acted where they saw fit. The essence of their teaching was to eliminate external strife from war and internal turmoil from desires—this was their limit.

Unburdened and unadorned, the heart is empty and preserves simplicity. Uncompromising and free from resentment, one cultivates sincerity and harmony. Transforming customs and engaging with things, they universally wished for safety. Without excessive personal enjoyment, they did not seek recklessly, for amassing too much invites harm—this is the way to lasting peace. Establishing this teaching in the world, clarifying the original heart without concealment, Song and Yin heard of it and rejoiced, following their Dao. The *Huashan* cap symbolized the uprightness and evenness of their conduct.

In engaging with things, they distinguished the good from the foolish, taking leniency toward the ignorant as their foundation—thus they never inclined toward evil, sufficiently enriching customs and advancing education. Yet their methods had flaws, falling short of the sage’s perfect and enduring governance. *"The heart’s capacity"* is like the bearing of hands or feet, referring to its demeanor in movement and stillness. *"The heart’s conduct"* refers to its arrangements and undertakings, manifesting the heart’s inherent goodness in action. Harmonizing all within the seas, without strife or anger, seeking universal peace and sufficiency—these words held kindness but lacked the intent of true governance.

Their wish to establish a ruler expressed the desire to follow his teachings. Enduring humiliation to halt strife, ceasing war, and stopping conflict—all embodied the principle of yielding and non-contention. Insistent and forceful, they demanded others heed their words. Offering but five *sheng* of rice, they showed too little care for themselves. Preferring their own hunger over forgetting the world, they showed too much concern for others. Laboring day and night to exhaustion, they sighed: *"I must surely live!"*—*"I toil to save others, so the Creator must preserve me."*

The ascetic mendicants of today, frugal with themselves yet meticulous in aiding others, somewhat resemble them—but lacking learning and insight, they fall far short. The phrase *"Scheming for pride?"* is difficult to interpret; among various explanations, Guo Xiang’s commentary comes closest. This is Zhuangzi’s sigh of lament.

Seeking arrogance is akin to plotting carelessness—speaking broadly and recklessly without regard for practical matters. These two sought to save the multitudes of the world through their own solitary strength, yet did not weigh the difficulty of such an endeavor. Not pursuing harsh scrutiny is called "excellent forbearance"; not borrowing external things to glorify oneself, and abandoning what brings no benefit to the world—this is called "excellent discernment."

In outward conduct, they forbade attack and ceased war, causing people to be self-sufficient and free from strife. In inward practice, they diminished shallow desires, disciplined themselves without reproach, and knew no respite. Though the principles of their affairs differed in scale and refinement, in essence, their conduct reached its utmost limit. Yet they could not ascend to the inner sanctum of the sages, and thus remained confined to Mohist teachings alone.

This passage critiques the flaws of the Mohists of that era, wherein the words hold primary and secondary meanings—these must be examined with care.

*The Meaning of the Southern Florescence Canon: Gathered Essence of the Ocean of Significance, Scroll One Hundred Four (concluded)*
*The Meaning of the Southern Florescence Canon: Gathered Essence of the Ocean of Significance, Scroll One Hundred Five*
*By the Daoist of Wulin, Chu Boxiu*
*Chapter Three: The World*

Those who act with impartiality yet form no factions, who are yielding yet free from self-interest, who decide without fixed allegiance, who follow things without duality, who neither dwell on deliberation nor rely on cunning, who make no distinctions among things and proceed with them as one—such was the Daoist art of antiquity. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard its influence and delighted in it. They took the equalization of the myriad things as their foremost principle, saying: "Heaven can cover them but cannot bear them; Earth can bear them but cannot cover them; the Great Dao can embrace them but cannot discriminate among them. Knowing that the myriad things each have what they can and cannot do, they declared: 'Selection cannot be all-encompassing; instruction cannot reach all; only the Dao leaves nothing behind.'"

Thus, Shen Dao discarded knowledge and abandoned the self, drifting with inevitability. He let things flow and settle, taking this as the principle of the Dao. He said: "To know that one does not know is to approach the brink of harm after slight knowledge." Unburdened and unconstrained, he mocked the world’s esteem for worthies; unbound and untrammeled, he rejected the world’s great sages. Like a hammer striking or an axe severing, he turned with things as they shifted. Casting aside right and wrong, he sought only to avoid entanglement. He did not model himself on wisdom or foresight, nor did he distinguish before or after, standing aloof and self-contained. Pushed, he then moved; pulled, he then went—like a whirling gale, like a spinning feather, like a grinding stone in its groove. Whole yet without fault, in motion or still without error, he was never at fault. For what reason was this so?

The unknowing thing harbors no peril of self-assertion, no burden of knowing; its movement and stillness never depart from principle, and thus it lives out its days without praise. Hence it is said: "To be as the unknowing thing—this alone suffices; there is no need for worthies or sages." A clod of earth never loses the Way.

The heroic and eminent mocked him, saying: "The Way of Shendao is no path for the living, but only the principle of the dead—how strange it is!" Tian Pian was likewise. He studied under Peng Meng and received "no-teaching." Peng Meng’s master said: "The Daoists of old reached the point where none could affirm or deny them." Their influence was like the rush of wind—how could it be put into words? Yet they constantly opposed others and drew no crowds, and so could not escape being crushed like turtleshell.

What they called the Way was not the Way, and what they affirmed could not avoid being wrong. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shendao did not know the Way. Nevertheless, they had once glimpsed something of it.

Guo’s commentary: Without fixed direction, each follows its own course—yet things attain their proper ends, and so become one. Only when all functions are employed does completeness arise; only when nature is entrusted does it reach fulfillment. *Lingtài* means "to listen and let go." It refers to the shallowness of knowing, which fails to entrust things to their spontaneity—thus slight knowledge is scorned, and harm draws near. To take on what one is not suited for is to take on the tasks of the multitude; if the multitude each does what it can, then there is no need to esteem worthies. To reject the world’s great sages is to destroy their traces so that things do not follow them.

Though the Legalists’ methods are subtle, they still rely on hammering and striking, and so cannot merge completely. Unable to discern right and wrong or distinguish before and after, they indulge their nature merely to avoid immediate harm. *Weiran* means "standing alone." To move or go only when pushed or pulled is what is meant by "following necessity." Rest arises from reputation, and reputation arises from self-assertion. Only the sage can cast aside knowledge and habit, following the principle of Heaven. Thus the foolish and the wise each occupy their proper place; the noble and the base each hold their rightful position; the worthy and the unworthy each follow their nature. To say there is no use for worthies or sages is why they are said not to know the Way. They wished to make people like clods of earth. Yet even ordinary things, in all their variety, cannot attain the Way—for the Way is not partial to any one thing.

Only by relinquishing knowledge and entrusting nature does the spirit become luminously clear—this is what makes one a worthy or a sage. Yet to say a clod never loses the Way is to liken a person to dirt—how could this not be death? This is why the heroic mocked them. Not yet having merged with the ultimate Way, they appeared strange and uncanny.

"Received no-teaching" refers to the Way of self-entrustment, where none can affirm or deny—what is called "equalizing the myriad things." *Wòrán* is the sound of wind blowing against something. Not conforming to popular expectations, though they established laws, they were crushed without leaving a trace. The Way is present everywhere, yet to say only a clod of earth never loses it is why they are said not to know. Nevertheless, they had once glimpsed something—though they did not reach it.

Lü’s commentary: Without partiality or self-interest, one is empty and without fixed direction, and so becomes one with things. Without regard or calculation, one moves with things. In the stillness of the ancient arts of the Way, these two heard the wind and were delighted; moved, they then grasped the causes of all under Heaven—yet these three did not know them.

Heaven is great, Earth is great, the Way is great—yet even they have what they cannot do. Thus we know that the myriad things have what they can and cannot do. Selection cannot be all-encompassing; teaching cannot reach all. Only by equalizing with the Way is nothing left out.

Thus Shendao cast aside knowledge and habit to follow necessity. *Ling* means "to clarify the turbid"; *tài* means "to remove disturbance." The ancients entered the Way through this, not taking it as the Way itself. These two took the Way to end here, not knowing that knowledge and self had never begun to exist.

When the myriad things arise together, this is how they return; in their profusion, this is how they revert to the root. None of this disturbs the heart. What Shendao took as the principle of the Way was merely "to know that one does not know"—yet to slight this knowledge is to invite harm. Only unknowing preserves wholeness.

Shendao knew only that knowing is not knowing, but did not know that not-knowing is true knowing. *Xǐkuǎ* means "unstable." "Unbound and untrammeled, rejecting the world’s worthies and sages"—this is what is meant by "casting aside knowledge and self." "Hammering, striking, severing"—the next three phrases describe *lingtài* in relation to things: refining and forging, crushing and breaking, turning and following. Thus they forgot knowledge, foresight, before and after, standing aloof alone. Moving or going only when pushed or pulled—like the whirling wind, the spinning feather. The groove of the grinding stone—its movement is not of itself.

"To be as the unknowing thing"—thus there is no peril of self-assertion or burden of knowing. Movement and stillness never depart from principle, and so there is no praise or fault. Shendao took this as the principle of the Way. "Only a clod never loses the Way"—this is the teaching of "cutting off the sage and casting aside knowledge," yet to cut off and cast aside is precisely what makes one a sage or worthy. How then is this different from the principle of the dead? This is why the heroic mocked him and he was deemed strange by the world.

Tian Pian studied under Peng Meng and received "no-teaching"—for if one relies on teaching, it does not reach. He spoke of the ancients reaching the point where none could affirm or deny them. Their influence was like the rush of wind—how could it be put into words? Yet it nearly approached the saying that "there has never been right or wrong, and the wise do not speak." But when one’s conduct opposes others and seeks to avoid drawing their gaze, one cannot escape being crushed.

The Way has never begun to exist as a thing, so to take emptiness and imperishability as its reality—why constantly oppose others and rely on hammering and crushing? What they called the Way was not the Way, and what they affirmed could not avoid being wrong, for they were mired in the realm of unknowing.

Though these three did not know the Way, they had once glimpsed something of it. Mo Di, Hua Li, Song Keng, and Yin Wen not only did not know the Way—they had never even glimpsed it.

The Dao originally arises from the truth of human nature and destiny, and its essence lies in governing the self. Yet Mo Di and Hua Li established conduct that departed from the world, even to the point of withholding love from others—thus losing their root and straying far from truth. Therefore, when discourses on the Dao spread and divided the world, those who first grasped it were followed by Song Keng and Yin Wen, who were said to know the Dao; Tian Pian and Shen Dao, who knew it and drew near; and others who progressed from the coarse to the refined.

*Dubi Zhu* notes: The safeguarding of the Dao lies herein. The three masters heard its influence and rejoiced, for their Way differed from that of Song and Yin. Thus, they took the equality of the myriad things as their starting point, unlike those who engage with things by first distinguishing boundaries.

Heaven can act as heaven but not as earth; earth can act as earth but not as heaven. The Dao operates between them, capable of embracing all yet unable to discriminate. From this, we know that the myriad things each have what they can and cannot do. Thus, when blended, they pervade all; when left to themselves, they reach their fullness; when embraced, they are complete; when distinguished, something is always left out.

Therefore, Shen Dao discarded knowledge and ceased disputation, abandoned the self and ceased engagement, following only what could not be avoided. He never sought to comprehend things through their stimuli nor to move them through the communication of words. Unfettered and self-abandoned, he was not burdened by things. Thus, even slight knowledge was deemed nearly injurious to principle. Seeking to forget it all, he took no responsibility, left no affairs, made no movements, and left no traces. The worthy have undertakings; the sagely have virtuous conduct. He laughed at and rejected these, holding none in esteem.

"Hammering and crushing" means breaking the form of what is to come. "Chopping and severing" means cutting away what has already decayed. Adapting to things with flexibility, setting aside right and wrong—thus one escapes entanglement.

Not following knowledge, without thought before or after, the mind like dead ashes, solitary and steadfast—never initiating yet always harmonizing, never moved yet always responding. Movement is like pushing a cart; advance is like dragging a tail, following only what cannot be avoided. Thus, like the wind returning, feathers spiraling, or a millstone’s groove, his power was whole, and his movement and stillness without fault. This was because he had no knowledge of things and no self regarding himself, so that no afflictions or burdens could reach him.

Fortune and misfortune arise from action; praise and blame emerge from assertion. The two masters roamed beyond fortune and misfortune, praise and blame, thus becoming like things without knowledge, taking the formless as not losing the Dao.

The Dao is what all things with form follow in common; power is what all beings with minds attain in common. Even in the tiniest shard of tile or stone, the Dao is present. Yet Shen Dao’s Dao was not the conduct of living people—hence it was deemed strange.

Tian Pian and Shen Dao studied together under Peng Meng and attained the unteachable Dao. Their influence was subtle and hidden, carrying an air of doubt; their true state could not be clearly expressed. They constantly opposed others and avoided drawing attention, for they had not yet equalized the myriad things.

The term "yuan-duan" describes a blunt, unpolished appearance without sharp edges. What they called the Dao sometimes strayed into non-Dao; what they deemed right sometimes fell into wrong. The three masters had indeed heard of the Dao but had not attained it.

*Laozi* once said to "reject sagacity and discard knowledge," yet Zhuangzi did not adopt Peng [Meng] and Shen [Dao] here—seemingly at odds. However, he likely used the two as allegories, stripping away their traces to show that their words were merely correctives for their time.

The *Bixu* commentary states: Factionalism precludes impartiality; self-interest obscures clarity. Without intent, the self does not dominate; governing by law leaves no room for doubt. Thus, one forgets knowledge and makes no choices, acting only by upholding the law.

Heaven and earth possess no complete achievements; sages possess no complete abilities. Since things have both possibilities and impossibilities, there must be governing principles. To abandon law and rely on selective instruction would leave affairs incomplete and principles unfulfilled.

The Dao encompasses all without omission, for it contains the law of spontaneity. The following four lines regarding Shen Dao mean that only thus can nothing be left out. "Leng-tai" means refining by law, sifting the coarse and fine of things to uphold the world’s principles. Though using law is not ideal, it is still better than having no law; without law, principles cannot stand, and chaos is unparalleled.

Shallow knowledge cannot avoid intent; with intent, one cannot be without bias. "Xike" mocks the absurdity of exalting worthiness without order. "Zongtuo" is reckless and unrestrained, not the sage’s boundless emptiness—these are the flaws of such a system!

"Chui-pai" means striking decisively; "yuan-duan" means severing limbs. Yet in application, they adapted to the nature of things, neither affirming nor denying, merely seeking to avoid disaster. Forgetting thought and knowledge, they rested securely, moving only after being pushed, acting like drifting wind or spinning feathers. Without the bias of knowledge, they became like things without awareness. Even if divine clarity descended, there would be nothing to apply—hence their withered, detached state drew universal astonishment.

The three masters all established teachings based on Mohist learning. Where there is teaching, there is right and wrong; yet they claimed nothing was right, nothing wrong, like a wind-vane producing sound without distinction—this was their attainment of the "unteachable."

Yet in opposing human nature, they could not avoid harsh judgments and severing punishments—this was not the kingly Dao. Their principles may have been sound, but their practice was not.

The three did not understand the Dao, yet they studied and gained renown in their time. Their teachings were simply not orthodox.

Yuan Qi said: "Qu-wu" refers to the principles and tendencies of the myriad things. "Not two" means oneness. Peng [Meng], Tian [Pian], and Shen [Dao]—the three masters—were recluses of Qi. Their doctrine held that heaven and earth are but two among the myriad things, and the foremost of these is the Dao of non-action. What heaven and earth can do is partial; the Great Dao encompasses all without distinction.

Things have both possibilities and impossibilities. Selection cannot be comprehensive; instruction cannot be exhaustive. Only by returning to the Dao is there nothing left to debate.

Abandoning knowledge and self is non-action. "Leng-tai" refines things without constraint. Their doctrine stated: If one divides by knowledge and ignorance, one is pressed by knowledge and harms oneself. "Tan-ke" means instability; "wu-ren" means not dwelling on affairs—hence they mocked the world’s exaltation of worthiness.

"Zongtuo" means unrestrained conduct, so they dismissed all sagely learning as wrong. "Chui-pai" and "yuan-duan" describe the absence of sharp edges, allowing them to adapt to things. Without right or wrong, they avoided worldly entanglements.

The metaphors of wind returning, feathers spinning, and the groove of a millstone all illustrate being without intent and adapting to things. Only without knowledge can one be free from self-bias and the burden of intent, moving and resting in accord with principle.

Not seeking knowledge from others, without reputation, they avoided blame—what need was there for the name of worthiness or sagacity? Merely being like a clod without awareness could preserve the Dao.

Such arguments resemble those of ascetics in the mountains and forests, so the heroic laughed at them as little better than the dead. These men studied in mutual accord, requiring no teaching to understand.

Their master’s words said: The ancients who practiced the Dao took the absence of right and wrong as their foundation, speaking like drifting wind without intent. Thus, how could they be discussed? Their views often opposed others, unable to gather like-minded followers, inevitably becoming one-sided doctrines. They sought only to avoid sharp edges.

"Yuan-duan" here is the same as "guan-duan" earlier. Though their words were bold, what they called the Dao was not the Dao. The three did not understand the Dao—yet from Zhuangzi’s grand perspective, they had all heard of it, merely failing to grasp its true essence.

To avoid factionalism is to be without self-interest. To order well without imposing one’s views allows the world’s things to converge as one. Without thought or planning, moving with things—this is why the three delighted in the wind of such a Dao, for their paths were the same.

Their teaching took the equalization of the myriad things as primary. Things are inherently unequal; the Dao equalizes them. Heaven and earth are the greatest of things, yet even they lack complete achievements—how much more so other things? The Dao encompasses all without distinction—this is how it equalizes.

The myriad things have both possibilities and impossibilities. Selection and instruction only increase inequality; uniting them through the Dao leaves nothing out. Thus, Shen Dao discarded knowledge and feigned stupidity, abandoned self and followed things, responding only when unavoidable—even his actions were non-actions.

Clarifying the source of the self, refining and sifting like "leng-tai," all things would follow. True knowledge arises from non-knowledge; merely diminishing knowledge still harms one’s nature—only by attaining non-knowledge is wholeness achieved.

"Xike" means not taking on affairs, so they mocked the world’s exaltation of worthiness as governance. "Zongtuo" means unrestrained conduct, so they dismissed all sagely learning as wrong. "Chui-pai" and "yuan-duan" describe the absence of sharp edges, allowing them to adapt to things. Without right or wrong, they avoided worldly entanglements—like wind returning, feathers spinning, or the groove of a millstone, all metaphors for being without intent and adapting to things.

Only without knowledge can one be free from self-bias and the burden of intent, moving and resting in accord with principle. Not seeking knowledge from others, without reputation, they avoided blame—what need was there for the name of worthiness or sagacity? Merely being like a clod without awareness could preserve the Dao.

The following passage aligns with the preceding text, and its meaning will be self-evident.

"Chui-pai" refers to flogging, and "yuan-duan" to the later term "yun-duan," meaning the execution of criminals—though they employed law and punishment, they adapted flexibly to circumstances, ensuring thorough fairness and alignment with principle. By harmonizing with the world’s conventional notions of right and wrong and penetrating to the essence of affairs, one may avoid calamity. "Gou mian" is a humble expression. Without relying on knowledge, one forgets considerations of past and future. Motionless as withered wood, they move only when pushed or pulled; their movement is like wind returning or feathers spinning, without intent in action and thus without error.

Things devoid of knowledge do not assert themselves or employ understanding; in movement and stillness, they are without intent and naturally accord with principle. With no reputation to seek, how can slander arise? Thus, they do not covet the name of sage or worthy, taking the state of a clod without awareness as the attainment of the Dao—unaware of the subtle workings of resonance and transformation, which is why the heroic mocked them as no different from the dead.

Tian studied under Peng, simply following the natural tendencies of things, learning to support them without distorting their essence—hence it is said he "attained without teaching." To study the Dao is to reach the point of transcending right and wrong, moving like wind passing a cliff, without intent to distinguish right from wrong—how could one then debate its reasons? Thus, they constantly opposed human sentiment, avoiding the world’s clamor for spectacle. "Clamor for spectacle" resembles the peril of building an observation tower.

Yet they could not entirely abandon law and punishment, for without them, governance would be difficult. What they called the Dao was not the true Dao, so though their words were often apt, they could not escape criticism. None of the three truly understood the Dao, yet their teachings once gained renown and cannot be entirely dismissed.

The *Nanhua*’s discussion of Peng, Tian, and Shen’s teachings surpasses those of Ku Huo and Yi Chi, placing them closer to Guan Yin and Lao Dan. They regarded the root as refined, things as coarse, accumulation as insufficiency, and dwelled in tranquility alone with the numinous. There were those in ancient Daoist arts who embodied this: Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of their teachings and delighted in them.

They established their foundation in the constant alternation of non-being and being, governed by the Great Unity, manifesting gentleness, humility, and deference as their outward form, and emptiness and non-destruction of the myriad things as their essence. Guan Yin said: "Abide in non-possession, and things will naturally manifest. In movement, be like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Vast as if absent, silent as if pure. Those who harmonize lose; those who grasp fail. Never precede others, yet always follow them."

Lao Dan said: "Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine, becoming the world’s stream. Know the bright, yet guard the humble, becoming the world’s valley. All seek precedence, yet I alone take the rear, saying, 'I bear the world’s disgrace.' All seek fullness, yet I alone take emptiness. Without hoarding, I have abundance, overflowing with surplus. In conducting myself, I am unhurried and without waste. In non-action, I mock craftiness. All seek fortune, yet I alone seek preservation through humility, saying, 'I merely avoid blame.' Taking depth as my root and restraint as my guiding principle, I say: 'What is rigid will break; what is sharp will dull.' Always yielding to things, never carving away at others—this may be called the ultimate."

Ah, Guan Yin and Lao Dan! The vast and true perfected ones of antiquity!

Guo’s commentary: "Accumulation is insufficiency; entrusting to the world brings abundance. How can non-being establish anything? By founding it in the constant alternation of non-being and being, one clarifies that things establish themselves. Heaven and earth, the myriad things—each attains its own nature without borrowing from others. Is this not governing through the Great Unity? Things come and one responds, responding without retention, so merit departs with things. Without self-assertion, one entrusts to the myriad things, and their forms naturally manifest. In movement and stillness, be like water and mirror—this illustrates constant non-attachment. Vast and silent, the ever-whole knows not what it has gained. Each thing guards its own portion, remaining still and silent.

Without the masculine or the bright, one does not vie for superiority or self-display—is this not exceeding one’s portion and endangering one’s life? The ancients did not follow boundless knowledge, thus preserving their nature. With nature whole, they returned like streams and valleys, and the world joyfully deferred to them without tiring. The feminine, the humble, the rear, the low—these are what the world calls disgrace. Those who seek fullness know only being as benefit, unaware of non-being’s use; those who seek emptiness abide in tranquility to await the multitude of beings. Without hoarding, one entrusts things to their own keeping, thus never exhausting their abundance. Standing alone and self-sufficient—this is the meaning.

In conducting oneself, one acts according to what benefits the people, following the four seasons to bring things to completion. Always in accord with principle, thus without harm or waste. The crafty act and harm the natural unfolding of the sacred vessel; the non-active follow things’ spontaneous arising and completion, allowing each to act on its own. Even spiders can weave webs—every person has their own abilities, so why value forced labor? Yielding to the highest principle ensures constant preservation; without seeking, fortune is self-sufficient. Following things, one avoids blame. Principle is rooted in the primordial Great Ultimate—how can it be called shallow? Taking restraint as one’s guiding principle means moderating excess.

Utmost compliance renders metal and stone no longer hard; encountering opposition, even water and vapor lose their depth. Compliance preserves, opposition destroys—this is the true principle. Advancing with restless haste is sharpness; each guarding its portion naturally has abundance, not carving away at others, thus preserving its nature."

Lü’s commentary: "Taking the Dao as refined, one regards things as coarse; regarding things as coarse, one takes non-being as refined. The Dao has never begun with things, thus accumulation is insufficiency. To reach the ultimate of emptiness, one must arrive at non-accumulation and then stop, dwelling in tranquility alone with the numinous."

The Dao of antiquity, with its roots and branches, essence and coarse forms, pervades all without exception—this is what is meant by taking the root as essence, adapting to the times alone. The Dao is fundamentally without thing, yet when it manifests in time, there remains something not yet established. If one founds it upon the constant of "non-being and being," then things cannot contend with it.

One and speech make two; if there is something called "one," it is not the Great One. With the Great One, even "one" cannot be attained, thus the myriad things return to it without knowing their master. The Dao, being formless, does not contend, and so takes softness, weakness, humility, and lowliness as its outward signs. Observing its outward signs, the inner reality it embodies may be known. Things each return to their root, and the body naturally becomes empty and void. Taking emptiness and voidness as the means by which the myriad things are not destroyed is the true reality—distinct from those who hammer, carve, or sever, mistaking these for the Dao.

Master Guan Yin’s eleven sayings all speak of the achievement of having no abode in oneself so that things naturally manifest. As *Laozi* says: "Know the masculine, keep to the feminine; know the white, guard the disgraced." The feminine is still and does not initiate; disgrace recedes and returns to the root. Valleys channel without accumulation; hollows respond without hoarding—thus the source of rivers and seas arises. This is what is meant by founding upon the constant of "non-being and being" and taking the Great One as the master. Remaining behind to receive disgrace, taking softness, weakness, humility, and lowliness as outward signs—dwelling in emptiness without hoarding, thus not destroying the myriad things but allowing them to be used, this is how one comes to have abundance.

Not preceding others but following them, one moves slowly without expenditure—distinct from those who labor the body and exhaust the self, mistaking this for the Dao. Allowing things to be empty of themselves without destroying them is unlike inanimate objects devoid of awareness. Preserving the whole by bending avoids blame—this is what is called fortune. Taking depth as the root, one need not strive for hardness. Taking restraint as the guiding principle, one need not strive for sharpness. Utterly empty and utterly vast, it constantly accommodates things. Not carving away at others, taking the root as essence and dwelling in tranquility alone with the numinous—what is embodied is the true reality of the Dao, which may be called the ultimate. Thus, one sighs: "Ah, the vast and true person of antiquity!"

*Duduzhu*’s commentary: "Constantly without desire, observe its wonders—this is taking the root as essence. Constantly with desire, observe its manifestations—this is taking things as coarse. Taking accumulation as insufficiency, for accumulation leads to limits, while dispersion leads to boundlessness."

*Zhuangzi* once said: "Utter non-being supplies all demands, for it is the utmost non-being that meets the needs of all that is under heaven; it is the utmost emptiness that responds to all realities under heaven." Tranquil and without desire, one is thus distant from the myriad things; not departing from essence, one thus dwells with the numinous. "Non-being" is the non-being that opposes being; "constant non-being" is not the non-being of absence but the non-being that does not oppose being—what is called "constant being" likewise does not oppose non-being. Founding upon the constant of "non-being and being," one enters obscurity—how could one then distinguish wonders and manifestations within it?

"Constant non-being" and "constant being" both take the Great One as their宗. With the Great One, not even the "one" of all under heaven can precede it, thus one guards it with softness and weakness and acts with humility and lowliness. "Outward signs" refer to what is visible externally. While others all seek the substantial, I alone take the empty; thus, I regard emptiness and voidness as true reality. Moving slowly without expenditure, acting without contrivance or artifice—thus, I regard not destroying the myriad things as true reality. Preserving oneself through emptiness and voidness, engaging with things without destroying them, soft, weak, humble, and lowly—these are the practices of *Laozi*. Emptiness and voidness without destruction—these are the virtues of *Laozi*.

Having no abode in oneself, one can thus cause things also to have no abode, adapting to change with the times, transcending the six dusts, so that forms and things manifest without obstruction. Moving in accord with the Way, one is still like water and thus clear like a mirror. Vast and possessing form yet seeming absent, silent and soundless yet seeming pure—harmonious yet not blending, attaining yet not possessing, never preceding but always following others, harmonizing without initiating.

Valleys contain and excel at receiving; hollows are empty and excel at responding. Knowing the masculine, one guards the feminine; not preceding things. Knowing the white, one guards the disgraced, nourishing oneself with obscurity. Glory and profit are what people precede; disgrace and defilement are what people leave behind. Others all seek the substantial and accumulate, thus they are insufficient; I alone take emptiness and voidness without hoarding, thus I have abundance. Like a secluded mountain standing alone, one is never insufficient.

In conducting oneself, the more dull one is, the greater the benefit; outwardly enriched yet inwardly undiminished, following the natural course of things without carving or severing. People seek fortune by striving for it; I seek fortune by not seeking it—preserving the whole by bending, merely avoiding harm, this is what is called fortune. Depth is the root of the Dao; restraint is its guiding principle. Hardness invites destruction, so one guards it with softness. Sharpness invites blunting, so one nurtures it with emptiness. Profound in dealing with things is called magnanimity; profound in dealing with others is called not carving away at them. This is the Dao of Guan Yin and Lao Dan.

*Bixu*’s commentary: "The essence of the wondrous root may be attained through intention; the coarseness of things may be transmitted through words. Because of accumulation, there is insufficiency; nothing surpasses great emptiness in abundance. Dwelling alone with the numinous means not deceiving even in darkness. 'Constant non-being and being' is the function of the Dao; the Great One is the master of the self. Emptiness and voidness are the宗 of things."

The perfected person has no self, and the myriad things are all oneself—moving without intention, still yet able to illumine, responding and thus penetrating, without fixed emotions. Seeming absent yet not absent, seeming pure yet not turbid, harmonious yet not defiled, seeming to lose yet not losing the self, not preceding but following. In one’s person, knowing the masculine yet guarding the feminine, nurturing oneself with humility; knowing the white yet guarding the black, dwelling in obscurity yet clear. Receiving the world’s disgrace, one endures humiliation. Without hoarding, one has abundance; giving to others, one has even more. Restlessness depletes the spirit; cleverness makes one a servant to others. Merely avoiding blame—what more could fortune seek?

Deep roots never leave their宗; restraint as the guiding principle makes it easy to grasp.

Spaciousness toward all things brings boundless compassion; refraining from diminishing others yields vast relief. These are but the coarse manifestations of the perfected person’s engagement with the world—what Guan Yin and Lao Dan diligently practiced.

The *Yuzhai* says: to regard accumulation as insufficiency is to store wealth throughout the world. Take non-being as the宗, and the inception of the Great Ultimate as the master.

The *exterior* is how one responds to the world and engages with things, manifesting outwardly. In emptiness, all things are complete—just as Shili Le Xuan said: "Where not a single thing exists, all things are fully present." Without abode or partiality, the master reveals itself, taking form as things arise.

The movement of water, the stillness of a mirror, the resonance of a valley—all are without intention. *Seeming absent*: as if present yet not present. *Seeming pure*: pure yet without name. To harmonize by merging with things, to attain by attaining nothing.

Knowing the masculine yet guarding the feminine, concealing ability within inability. Knowing the white yet guarding the black, dwelling in obscurity yet not being obscure. The meaning of streams and valleys: low-lying yet able to contain all things.

Only by treating emptiness as substance can one have abundance without hoarding, remain unharmed in tranquility. Others regard cleverness as cleverness; I regard non-doing as cleverness. Others regard fortune as fortune; I regard avoiding blame as fortune.

Taking depth as the root speaks to its origin in the Great Unity’s inception. Taking restraint as the guiding principle speaks to simplicity as the method of preserving oneself. All things that are hard and sharp will suffer breakage and ruin. To measure oneself by accommodating others is to ensure that none can diminish or harm one’s life—this is the ultimate Way of the world!

The Way is the root of all living things, subtle and invisible; things are but the remnants of the Way, coarse and manifest. The world pursues accumulation to sustain itself, yet the more it accumulates, the more it lacks. The vast and boundless void is where spirit and clarity unite, encompassing and embracing all without destruction or completion—even if the world’s myriad things were fully possessed, how could they surpass the nothingness of emptiness?

When one is serene and desireless, the body harmonizes with the Great Void and dwells with spirit. Free from accumulation outside, abundant within the breast—this is what Guan Yin and Lao Dan excelled in. All things arise from non-being, yet human delusions cling to being. To thoroughly investigate constant non-being is difficult; to maintain non-being while engaging with being is even more so!

To establish oneself in the realm of constant non-being and being, one must take the Great Unity as the master. The Great Unity is the One before form, the origin before heaven and earth, the primordial nature of humanity. Abiding in this, one knows that things have never truly begun—thus, the exterior is revealed through gentleness, humility, and yielding.

The *exterior* refers to what is seen in conduct. Thus, one engages with things without opposing them, emptying oneself without destroying the myriad things. *Not destroying* means preserving without judgment. When the self is forgotten, things transform on their own—why wait to destroy them? When no thing fills the foreground, what is solid is emptied by me.

Within the self, without abode, things take form on their own—this is the same idea. The movement of water, the stillness of a mirror, the resonance of a valley—all illustrate the naturalness of non-intention. *Seeming absent*: cannot be grasped as existing. *Seeming pure*: cannot be disturbed.

Harmonizing by merging with things, losing by grasping—thus, not preceding but following, one remains unceasing throughout life. Knowing the masculine yet guarding the feminine is to see strength and think of softness. Knowing the white yet guarding the black is to dwell in brightness yet value obscurity. Streams and valleys illustrate the virtue of yielding, where all flows converge.

Receiving the world’s disgrace, possessing capacity—thus virtue becomes great. Without hoarding, one has abundance. Empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever-flowing. Thus, one stands serenely above the myriad things, with no thing intruding upon the heart, and no thing not belonging to oneself.

One’s conduct is never restless yet always self-sufficient. The heart delights in non-doing, not envying worldly cleverness. Others seek fortune beyond themselves; I alone regard preservation through humility as fortune. If one can merely avoid blame, what greater fortune could there be?

*Deep roots* refer to inner solidity. *Restraint as the guiding principle* refers to reducing entanglements—thus avoiding the breakage of hardness and the blunting of sharpness. Spaciousness that accommodates all things neither diminishes others nor enriches oneself—this is evident.

All these are the ultimate principles of how one establishes oneself and engages with things, the refined essence of the vast and perfected person.

As the *Daodejing* states: "Knowing the white yet guarding the black"—the phrasing differs slightly in the *Zhuangzi*. *Nanhua Zhenjing Yihai Zuanwei*, Scroll One Hundred Five Concludes. *Nanhua Zhenjing Yihai Zuanwei*, Scroll One Hundred Six.

The Daoist Chu Boxiu of Wulin, ranked fourth among the scholars under heaven, spoke thus:

Void and formless, ever-changing and impermanent—does it align with death? With life? With heaven and earth together? With the spirits’ departure? Vague and boundless, where does it go? Sudden and fleeting, where does it drift? All things are encompassed, yet none suffice as a return. Among the ancient arts of the Dao, there was one that resided herein, and Zhuang Zhou, hearing its wind, delighted in it.

With meandering and distant discourse, vast and unbounded words, and limitless, unbounded phrases, he indulged freely without constraint, never forcing his intent upon others. He regarded the world as turbid and murky, unfit for solemn speech. Thus, he employed *zhi*-words as ceaseless unfolding, *chong*-words as truth, and *yu*-words as expansiveness. Alone, he roamed with the spirit of heaven and earth, yet did not scorn the myriad things, nor dispute right and wrong, thereby dwelling harmoniously with the common world. Though his writings were ornate and resplendent, their continuity remained unbroken and unharmed; though his phrases were uneven, their strangeness and wonder were worth beholding.

His inner fullness could not be restrained. Above, he wandered with the Creator; below, he befriended those beyond life and death, beyond beginning and end. In its foundation, it was vast and expansive, profound and unrestrained; in its essence, it was harmonious and perfectly attuned, ascending to the utmost. Yet though it responded to transformations and untangled things, its principle was inexhaustible, its advent unchanging. Vague and obscure, it remained unfathomed.

Guo’s commentary: Formless and impermanent, it follows things. Death or life—it accords with transformation. Where does it go? Where does it drift? Without intent toward things. None suffice as return, thus it wholly abides in placelessness. With limitless, unbounded phrases, he indulged freely without constraint, not hastening to make his intent known. Burdened by form and name, solemn speech is deemed mad and untrustworthy, hence he did not employ it. His *zhi*-words and *yu*-words both conveyed the utmost principle, perfectly aligning with the nature and destiny of the myriad things. Without personal right or wrong, he allowed things to proceed in duality. Shaped by the multitude of things, he dwelt among the common world. Returning to mutual accord, it remained unharmed. Not merely responding to the affairs of the time, hence uneven. His inner fullness could not be restrained, for it possessed abundance.

Zhuangzi conveyed his intent with equanimity, whether speaking of himself or others. Examining his words, they are vast and boundless—like Yu’s grand declarations, what fault lies herein?

Lü’s commentary: Formless, hence unseen; impermanent, hence unfathomable. To deem it aligned with death is to say it never had life; to deem it aligned with life is to say it never had death. To deem it aligned with heaven and earth is to say it never had past or present; to deem it aligned with the spirits’ departure is to say it never had self or other. Thus, vague and boundless, it remains quiescent and unmoving. All things are encompassed, none are not entrusted to it. None suffice as return—is this not the work of the spirit alone?

With meandering and vast, unfathomable words, he indulged freely without rigidity, for all had their counterparts. Not forcing his intent upon others, even if his words lacked substance or coherence, they were not hindered from being trustworthy. Solemn speech, like legalistic words, follows only the Dao. *Zhi*-words illustrate the Dao’s endless daily use. *Chong*-words and *yu*-words adapt to the times. When people do not trust one’s words, one invokes the ancients for weight. When *chong*-words fail to convey, then *yu*-words follow.

What Zhuangzi embodied was to roam alone with the spirit of heaven and earth, without scorn for the myriad things—hence his words were likewise. Scorn (*aoni*) is like estrangement. Not disputing right and wrong, he thus mingled with the common world. Though his writings were magnificent and resplendent, their continuity remained unbroken and unharmed. *Lian* means without gaps; *fei* implies a fixed form, yet it cannot be sought or valued by the common world. *Chu gui* refers to the strangeness of his words, which the common world cannot deem base. Only because his inner fullness could not be restrained, above he wandered with the Creator, below he befriended those beyond life and death, beyond beginning and end—thus entering the realm of the spirit!

In its foundation, it was vast, taking heaven as its essence, harmonious and perfectly attuned, never departing from its source—hence it responded to transformations. Its principle was inexhaustible, untangling things. Its advent was unchanging, for form does not await shedding to be untangled. Vague and obscure, unfathomed—this is the unknowable nature of the spirit.

Yi Du’s commentary: The perfected person roams the mind in quiescence, harmonizes *qi* in emptiness. Though possessing form, it is as if formless; renewing the old, it remains impermanent. Heaven and earth are the body of the spirit; the spirit is the function of heaven and earth. The body is constant, while function governs change. Externalizing things to the point of transcending life and death, embodying the Dao to the point of following transformation. Though all things are encompassed, none lie beyond the Dao. Thus, the sages of old made their Dao the model for all ages, valued by the world—its essence lies in nothing not being encompassed, nothing not being pervaded.

Zhuangzi’s words aimed to correct the ills of his time. Knowing they could not avoid being meandering and vast, he placed himself after the other masters who had heard the wind, indulging freely in his speech without partiality, observing broadly without forcing his intent. The world was unfit for solemn speech, hence he followed with *zhi*-words, *chong*-words, and *yu*-words. Roaming with the spirit of heaven and earth, without scorn for the myriad things, his words aligned with principle and responded to things. Right and wrong are fundamentally nonexistent, hence no need to dispel them—sometimes, one dispels them through words. Only by blending right and wrong could he dwell in the world without fear. His words, though magnificent and unbroken, remained unharmed; his phrases, though uneven, were strange and wondrous to behold—all arising from inner fullness, manifesting outwardly, unable to be restrained. Wandering with the Creator, beyond life and death, beyond beginning and end—hence its foundation was vast.

Its fundamental harmony is attuned, its responses transform and resolve things—riding principle without exhaustion, following the times without deviation. Thus, it remains vast and obscure, its limits unknowable, without beginning or end yet never departing from its source.

The *Bixu* commentary states: Stillness and formlessness are the essence of the Dao. Transformation without constancy is its function. Life and death are the Dao’s transformations. Heaven and earth are the Dao’s constancy. Spirit and illumination are the Dao’s pathways. Vast and boundless, nowhere to return—such is the Dao’s subtlety. "Without price" means adhering to the proper measure. "Not with partial vision" means no bias. "Solemn speech" refers to upright and grand words.

The *Nanhua* writes with central correctness as its foundation, yet unfolds endlessly; with profound virtue as its substance, yet remains true and unfeigned; with allegory as its function, yet broadly imparts teaching. Roaming with the spirit of heaven and earth, without scorn for the myriad things, it accompanies heaven without obscuring humanity—thus dwelling in the human world. Magnificent and extraordinary, flowing in unbroken succession, uneven yet wondrous to behold, its Dao is full and replete, profound and boundless. Thus, it transforms effortlessly, vast and reaching the root, harmonizing the principles of things, ascending to the source of transformation.

If the Dao could be exhausted through discourse, how coarse would be the depths of its primal unity! If it could be fathomed by thought, how shallow would be the vast emptiness of creation! Thus, from ancient times, sages and worthies have arisen in succession, unable to cease.

*Yongzhai* says: From "stillness and formlessness" to "whither does it go?"—this clarifies that the utmost spirit moves in unison with creation, without pathways. Thus, the myriad things appear before it, yet none know where they return. Without bias, one does not see with partiality—what is seen is not confined to one end. "Solemn speech" is dignified and truthful language. Roaming with the spirit of heaven and earth means befriending the spontaneity of creation. "Without reproach" means no attachment. "Unbroken succession" means harmony and accord. "Without harm" means without satire. "Uneven" means rising and falling without fixed form. "Wondrous" means playful and humorous. All these reveal the intent behind the writing.

Fullness cannot be restrained—its principles pervade the text, a book indispensable to the world. "Ascending" means attaining the principles of heaven, thus responding to transformation and resolving the principles of things. "Without deviation" means not departing from the Dao. "Vast and obscure" describes the profundity of the text, yet what fills the author’s heart cannot be fully expressed in words.

This chapter, following the general preface, divides into five parts, placing itself last, succeeding Laozi, to show its learning has a source. The first three sections each bear the word "though," yet all judge the right and wrong of their learning—only Laozi is without it. Here, the word "though" appears again, indicating its learning is not without use in the world. Where the text shifts, the brushwork is most masterful.

Formless and unconstant—this speaks of the Dao as without fixed form yet spiritually transformative. Death and ultimate departure—this speaks of humans following transformation without limit. Vast and boundless, nowhere to return—this speaks of the forgetful wanderer for whom no path is not fitting. With absurd and far-reaching words, unrestrained yet not careless—like one who acts wildly yet treads the great way, not allowing others to see one’s rigidity, blending with the world without losing the Dao.

Because the world cannot be addressed with solemn and upright speech, *zhi*-words, *chong*-words, and *yu*-words are established to convey meaning. Roaming alone with the spirit of heaven and earth, one leaves the human realm to enter the celestial, roaming freely to the eight limits. Without scorn for the myriad things, without faulting others’ right and wrong, one dwells in the world with harmonious light, responding to things without obstruction. Though the words are magnificent, they follow the world without harm. Their phrases are uneven and irregular—what is called "absurd" and "wondrous to behold" is what is meant by "magnificent." Their fullness within is manifest without. Thus, roaming with the Creator, befriending the endless and beginningless, is to roam with the spirit of heaven and earth—its wonder cannot be described. Its foundation is vast and profound, as if rooted in depth, its harmony attuned. "Ascending" means taking heaven as its source. "Responding to transformation" refers to birth. "Resolving things" refers to death.

Humans dwell within creation, moved by its mechanisms—its principles cannot be exhaustively explained, its coming cannot be escaped. Vast and obscure without end—this is what makes it creation. If one can obscure the mind amidst the vast and obscure and grasp what moves transformation, then one may roam with the spirit of heaven and earth, unashamed of the endowment of human spirit.

This section of the *Nanhua* first discusses transformation; next, it obscures its own words and deeds; finally, it returns to transformation, showing that its ability to fathom the spirit and know transformation means all its horizontal and vertical discourse is nothing but the Dao.

Hui Shi was multifaceted; his writings filled five carts. His Dao was contradictory and fragmented, his words never hitting the mark. His *Intent of Surveying Things* states: "What is greatest without beyond is called the Great One; what is smallest without within is called the Small One. What has no thickness cannot be accumulated, yet it is vast as a thousand *li*. Heaven and earth are low; mountains and marshes are level. The sun is just at its zenith as it inclines; things are just born as they die. Great sameness differs from small sameness—this is called the small sameness and difference. The myriad things are entirely the same and entirely different—this is called the great sameness and difference. The southern region is both infinite and finite. Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday. Linked rings can be unlinked. I know the center of the world—it is north of Yan and south of Yue. Embracing all things with love, heaven and earth are one body."

Hui Shi regarded these as great truths. Observing the world and enlightening debaters, the debaters of the world delighted in them. "Eggs have hair."

"A rooster has three feet. Ying possesses all under heaven. A dog can be a sheep. A horse lays eggs. A toad has a tail. Fire is not hot. Mountains have mouths. Wheels do not touch the ground. Eyes do not see. Fingers do not reach. What is reached is not absolute. A tortoise is longer than a snake. A carpenter’s square is not square; a compass cannot draw a perfect circle. A chisel does not encircle its handle. The shadow of a flying bird never moves. The speed of an arrow’s flight has moments when it neither moves nor stops. A dog is not a hound. A yellow horse and a black ox make three. A white dog is black. A lone colt never had a mother. Take half of a one-foot staff each day, and it will never be exhausted for ten thousand generations.

Debaters used these to engage with Hui Shi, endlessly. Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long, followers of the debaters, adorned men’s minds and altered their intentions; they could win in verbal argument but could not convince the heart. Such was the confine of the debaters.

Hui Shi daily used his knowledge to contend with others in debate, uniquely crafting strange arguments with the world’s debaters. This was his root. Yet Hui Shi’s oral disputations, though he deemed himself the most worthy, were grand yet without method. There was in the southern region a recluse named Huang Liao who asked why heaven and earth did not collapse or sink, and the causes of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Hui Shi did not decline but responded, without deliberation, expounding on all things. He spoke without ceasing, profusely and endlessly, yet still deemed his words few, adding ever more strangeness."

Taking reversal of others as substance and seeking fame through victory over others—this is why he never harmonized with the crowd. Weak in virtue yet strong in things, his path was narrow and obstructed. Viewing Hui Shi’s abilities through the Dao of heaven and earth, his efforts were but the toil of a single mosquito or gnat—what use were they to the myriad things? To fulfill even one aspect would be preferable; to value the Dao more highly would be near the mark!

Yet Hui Shi could not find peace in this; he scattered himself among the ten thousand things without surfeit, and in the end gained renown for his eloquence. Alas for Hui Shi’s talent—so vast yet unharnessed, chasing the ten thousand things without return! It was like exhausting echoes with sound, or racing one’s shadow in competition—how lamentable!

Guo’s Annotation: Before I had read the *Zhuangzi*, I once heard debaters contend over the meaning of the "foot-long staff" and the "linked rings," all claiming these were Zhuangzi’s words, and thus took them for the school of disputation. Examining this chapter’s critique of the various masters, when it reaches this passage, it declares their Dao to be contradictory and their words off the mark—thus I realized how hearsay and wayward discourse harm truth. I also thought such talk lacked any system for governing the state, truly what one calls useless chatter. Yet for sons of the elite, equal in their leisurely diversions, when weary of canonical words, to be able to debate names and analyze principles, thereby expressing their qi and focusing their thoughts, and leaving this to later generations—if it keeps their natures from deviance, is this not still preferable to gambling and board games? Thus I preserve it without further comment, to bequeath to those fond of such matters.

Lü’s Annotation: The *Laozi* says: "Much speech leads to exhaustion," and again: "Sparse speech accords with nature"—thus those who speak do so only when unavoidable. Yet Hui Shi’s oral disputations deemed himself worthy, unaware of heaven and earth’s vast emptiness and his own excessive self-regard, unable to abide in the feminine. No wonder he took heaven and earth as grand, preserving the masculine yet lacking defense!

The sage takes wordlessness as speech, thereby embodying virtue. Now Hui Shi relied on eloquence, taking reversal of others as substance and victory over others as fame—thus he knew nothing of wordlessness. Enslaved by words, unable to overcome himself, he was weak in virtue; seeking fame through victory over others, he was strong in things. His path was obstructed, meaning it was not the Dao of the six penetrations and four unfoldings.

The Dao of heaven and earth is great because it is non-action. Hui Shi’s abilities could not escape self-regard. Viewed through the Dao of heaven and earth, though his debates were vast, they were but the toil of a single mosquito or gnat—what use were they to the myriad things? The One and the many are both the Dao. The One is the root, the many the branches. Though the One alone is insufficient to complete root and branches, compared to those who forget the root and chase the branches, one may still say it values the Dao more highly and is near the mark.

Hui Shi did not return to the root to find peace but scattered himself among the ten thousand things without surfeit, ultimately gaining renown for eloquence, chasing things without return. Without sound, echoes cease; in darkness, shadows vanish. Without self, none in the world contend with one. Though Hui Shi had talent, he did not emerge from this; he merely pursued the externals of speech, competing with things—how was this different from exhausting echoes with sound or racing one’s shadow? His loss of nature was profound! Thus I deeply lament and pity him.

**Yi Du’s Annotation:**
"External" implies there is something beyond—this is called "great." When something is so great that nothing lies beyond it, it is called the "Great One." "Internal" implies there is something within—this is called "small." When something is so small that nothing lies within it, it is called the "Small One."

Hui Shi’s disputations could unsettle men’s minds and alter their intentions. Sometimes he debated the world over numbers, as in "a chicken has three feet." Sometimes he debated names, as in "a dog is not a hound." Sometimes he debated forms, as in "a carpenter’s square is not square." Sometimes he debated colors, as in "a white dog is black." Sometimes he debated high and low, as in "heaven and earth are base." Sometimes he debated long and short, as in "a tortoise is longer than a snake." His arguments generally held that the myriad things possess no distinctions of high or low, long or short; no differences of form, name, square, or round; no divisions of green, yellow, black, or white. He took the equalization of all things as his foremost principle, claiming that the great Dao, once dispersed, gives rise to forms and names—all mere products of human bias, nothing more than artificial distinctions.

Relying on this, Hui Shi debated the world and ultimately gained fame for his eloquence. Yet when measured against the works of heaven and earth, his disputations were but the labor of a single mosquito or insect—something the ancients would not have done, nor what scholars would have praised. Thus, regarding Hui Shi, one does not say, "The guardians of the ancient Way reside in this." This is why Zhuangzi lamented his talent, which was ultimately spent in chasing things, losing his original truth.

**Bi Xu’s Annotation:**
The Great Void has no beyond and admits no duality; the tip of an autumn hair has no within and stands alone. What can be accumulated has thickness—how could it be limited to a thousand *li*? Viewed from the Great Void, heaven and earth are both base; seen from the azure expanse, mountains and marshes are all level.

In the time it takes to cross arms, the sun has already shifted from midday to slanting light. In the span of a bow and a rise, things are born and die in the same instant. Things possess appearances, images, sounds, and colors—this is their great sameness. Things gather by kind and separate by category—this is their minor difference. Yet all arise from the transformation of a single *qi*—this is their fundamental unity. The ten thousand forms differ in species—this is their ultimate diversity.

Once position is fixed, there is already limitation. Now arriving, then departing, the intent precedes the act. If form can be divided and spirit can depart, then even linked rings can be undone. His discourse expanded without regard for principle.

North of Yan and south of Yue each deems itself the center. The empty and the blended merge without interruption. Hui Shi used such arguments to display his grand vision to the world. Debaters delighted in them, echoing one another in unison.

An egg has no feathers, yet the fledgling that hatches from it does. A chicken has two feet, but counting "one, two" makes three. Ying was established as a capital and thus came to possess the world. "Dog" and "sheep" are merely names imposed by the ancients. To call an embryo an "egg" is but a regional expression. The people of Chu call a toad a "dingzi," and when it has a tail, it is in its tadpole stage. Fire-beasts of the sea and mountains do not find fire hot; a mountain’s protrusion is called a "mouth," just as one speaks of the "mouth of the Milky Way" or a "road’s end." The rut left by a wheel’s passage is called a "track"—the earth is not mentioned.

The eye cannot see itself; what sees is the spirit. Whatever one points to, one points to where it is not. If it were reached, the boundary would meet it, and there would be no separation. A tortoise is longer than a snake when comparing lifespans, not forms. A compass and square are the methods for making squares and circles, not the shapes themselves. Mortise and tenon are but temporary joins.

When principle is not mutually entailed, it is like the independent transformation of form and shadow. A flying bird moves, yet its shadow does not. An arrow is loosed and flies without cease; when it falls, it stops and does not move. A dog with a suspended hoof is called a "hound" by convention, but a dog is not a hound. A yellow ox and a black cow make three when combined and separated. Hard and white stones exemplify the unity of difference and sameness.

If a dog is white in body but blind in one eye, one calls it "blind" and not "white." If its hoof is crippled and its body white, one forgets the white and names it "lame." A colt has a mother and thus is not called "orphan." A square inch of land, used morning and night, can never be exhausted—this is the meaning of "the foot-long staff is inexhaustible."

His discourse concerned the Dao, not things, and he sought to astonish the world’s debaters. This was its foundation. Heaven moves with vigor; earth is vast and deep—this is their majesty. Hui Shi relied on his glib tongue, seeking to contend with them, yet he did not know to guard the feminine, to cultivate tranquility and nurture heavenly harmony. He merely preserved the masculine without defense.

He leaned on others, seeking to prop up his theories with the words of the ancients, unable to establish a school of his own. Thus, when asked about the workings of heaven, earth, wind, and thunder, Hui Shi spun out explanations—copious and strange—self-regarding and competitive, weak in virtue. His broad disputations prized the unusual, overpowering things.

Viewed by the Dao of heaven and earth, Hui Shi’s abilities were but those of a mosquito or insect—what account should be taken of them? The world values the Dao because its teachings are transmitted in books. Hui Shi’s writings, at best, suffice as the words of a single school. Yet his arguments—from "a chicken has three feet" onward—address no urgent need of the age. He did not know that great eloquence is like silence, yet he sifted husks and chaff, exhausting his spirit in vain. This is why the Master of Painted Bamboo sighed deeply in lament.

**Yan Zhai’s Oral Teachings:**
Followers like Mo Di, Song Xing, Peng Meng, and Shen Dao were still partial in their grasp of the Dao. Hui Shi, however, was devoted solely to disputation and thus does not rank among those who heard the Dao’s unfolding. He is mentioned separately at the end of the "Examining Things" chapter.

"Utmost greatness has no beyond"—this is the Great Void. "Utmost smallness has no within"—this is like the tip of an autumn hair. These eight words align with Zhuangzi’s teaching, but to call them the "Great One" and "Small One" invites contention. In truth, the One has no great or small. Within his arguments, distinctions arise between sameness and difference, difference and sameness.

"Without thickness" means utmost thinness. Accumulated, it becomes thick, and its greatness can extend a thousand *li*. When heavenly *qi* descends, it levels with the earth; when mountain *qi* connects with marshes, it levels with the marsh. When the sun is at its zenith, to glance sideways is to see it no longer centered.

When things first arise, their seeds are the deaths of former days. Things have small and great, forming small sameness and difference; combining the sameness and difference of the myriad things forms great sameness and difference. The great does not transcend the accumulation of the small, and the small, when combined, can become great—thus there is neither sameness nor difference.

The southern direction points to the boundless sea, yet calling it a "direction" implies it must have limits. Heaven tilts to the northwest, and the sea lies to its south, even more distant than the other three directions. "Now approaching what came before" means that though one has not yet reached the place, one first hears its name and later arrives.

Linked rings each form their own circle, inherently unconnected—this, too, is like untying. The north of Yan and the south of Yue are certainly not the center of the world, yet the people of each land take their own country’s center as the world’s center. Heaven and earth are but one thing among the myriad, like a single body.

The down on a hatchling may not yet be visible, yet a duck is a duck and a chicken is a chicken—their feathers differ, so the down already exists. A chicken has two feet by nature, but when something moves it, that makes three. The capital of Chu was Ying, yet its king was like one who possessed the world.

The names "dog" and "sheep" arise from people; had one initially called a dog a sheep, then today it would still be called a sheep. Though birth from wombs and eggs differs, their names also arise from people—one could just as well call a horse egg-born.

Tadpoles begin as *dingzi* and *xiamu*, first taking the form of polliwogs, thus having tails. "Cold water" and "hot fire" are also names given by people; yet there are fire-dwelling rats, so fire is not always hot.

In an empty valley, a person’s call echoes in response—is this not the mountain having a mouth? A wheel rolling on the ground becomes a wheel; when fixed to the ground, it cannot turn—yet one may say it does not roll upon the earth.

The eye sees, and then the finger can reach; where the eye cannot reach, the finger cannot see. Thus what reaches is neither the eye nor the finger alone, and they cannot be wholly separated.

If a tortoise were as long as a snake, it could not be called a tortoise; to call it a tortoise, its length must be only thus. Once called a carpenter’s square, it cannot also be called a square—so too with the compass.

The handle fits into the socket, yet the tenon’s rotation cannot be stopped by the mortise, for it is not confined by the encircling. The shadow follows the flying crow, yet one may say the crow flies but not that the shadow moves.

An arrow on the bowstring is at rest; when shot at the target, it is in motion. Between leaving the bow and reaching the target, there is a time of neither motion nor rest.

"Dog" and "hound" are one, yet to call it a dog is not to call it a hound. The ox and horse are two bodies; "yellow-black" is a color. To speak of two bodies together with a color makes three; to attach "yellow-black" to the bodies of ox and horse also makes three.

The names "black" and "white" do not arise from the beginning of things—thus one could just as well call white black. To name a foal "orphan" implies it has no mother, yet one also says it once had a mother.

A foot-long rod split in two may be used today and tomorrow, and for ten thousand generations it will not be exhausted. This is scholars extending his arguments, contending endlessly with Hui Shi in forced disputation.

Root and trunk—his fundamental capacity goes no further than this. Relying on eloquence to bolster himself, he equates his existence with heaven and earth, thinking himself mighty when in truth he lacks all learning.

A lone figure—one who stands apart, uniquely aloof. Heaven and earth, wind and thunder are all marvels of creation—how can words contain them? Hui Shi, refusing to yield, countered with narrow doctrines, taking opposition as ability and clashing with the world.

Within, he gains nothing, his virtue daily weakening; yet he exhausts himself in external disputation.

Oh, the profound obscurity!

Viewing Hui Shi’s abilities through the Dao of heaven and earth, he is but a mere gnat—what use is he? To be content with one’s private opinions alone may suffice; but to claim superiority over the noble Way is perilous indeed. Hui Shi never grasped the Dao, gaining fame only through disputation. He may be called talented, yet his reckless abandon, oblivious to reflection, is truly lamentable.

Echo arises from sound, sound being its root and echo its branch; to exhaust echo through sound is to ignore the root. So too with form racing its shadow.

Zhuangzi concludes his work with Hui Shi—though not among those who heard the Dao, his words remain extraordinary, preserved and not discarded. Writing books differs from composing essays, each having its own structure. Openings and closings are where intent resides, as in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*’ abrupt end with the capture of the qilin, or the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s “Heaven’s charge.” In this work, the *Inner Chapters*’ “Hundun’s seven apertures” follow the same pattern. Those who explain the classics in terms of literary technique may not fully grasp the principle; those profound in principle may overlook literary form. Thus, few achieve perfection. Only Master Aixuan, Lin Gong of Wenjie, excelled in both principle and literary refinement, elevating the interpretation of the *Six Classics* above all others through the ages. Alas, after Master Leshan, Chen Gong of Le Xuan, his learning was not transmitted, and now none remain who know it.

Master Aixuan of Putian, Vice Minister of Works, Lin Guangchao (style name Qianzhi), passed his teachings to Master Wangshan, Lin Gong (style name Xueke), who in turn transmitted them to Master Leshan, Chen Zao (style name Yuanjie), both of whose collected works circulated in the world. Master Zhuxi, Lin Gong of Yanzhai, was the direct heir of Le Xuan.

At the end of Lu Deming’s *Pronunciations and Meanings*, it is recorded: “Zixuan’s commentary, in its broad strokes, may be said to have grasped Zhuangzi’s intent.” Guo sighed at the decadent sophistry of his time; I, too, have late witnessed the vain discourse of the privileged. This is what is meant by “different eras, same customs”—how can one speak of it further?

Some ask: If Zhuangzi and Hui Shi shared the bond of Hao Liang’s covenant and the model of the Ying craftsman, why do their teachings diverge so sharply, their words missing the mark? Could their bond have been like the Ying craftsman’s, where praise and blame were as one, yet their mutual reproach so severe?

I say: One who seeks to exhaust the breadth of teaching and illuminate its words—how could they not refine their language and exhaust their analogies? Zhuangzi sounded his resonant tones in the *Seven Chapters*, presenting this text to the world. His profound words traversed the path of the mysterious, his arguments unfolded with eloquent subtlety. Though his discourse disdained vain debate, his teachings were never empty chants. Yet his writing is easy to read, its purport difficult to fathom. Those who approach it without comprehension risk misjudging its principles. To remedy this flaw in the text, he thus grandly displayed Hui Shi’s vast disputation.

Liu Gai’s general discussion states: The Dao’s body is vast, encompassing all without omission. Form and number begin with the One, the odd and even giving rise to one another. Beyond this, even the most skillful reckoning cannot calculate. The ancients followed the order of the great Dao, aligning with the principles of spirit and illumination, thus establishing the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship. In matters of measurement and degree, complexity and constraint abound, yet the root and branches, the one that scatters into ten thousand, were never truly severed. Thus, they emerged and withdrew, stilled and stirred, shortened and lengthened, to correct the world’s crookedness and adapt to its uneven changes.

Moreover, Fu Xi had his methods, yet they were perfected under Yao; the Two Emperors had their governance, yet it was completed under the Zhou. They neither rushed ahead to favor the new nor lagged behind to cling to the old. This is what sages in high position could not fully encompass. Yi Yin bore his task; Bo Yi corrected it with purity, yet purity verged on narrowness. Liu Xia Hui harmonized it, neither opposing the world to uphold integrity nor following custom to seek fame. This is what sages in low position could not fully perfect.

The Dao reached its culmination with Confucius, emerging perhaps once in a thousand or a hundred years. The sages before Confucius adapted to their times out of necessity; the various masters after Confucius established their schools, each affirming their own rightness. By Zhuangzi’s time, the sages were long gone, and the Dao of virtue and righteousness had been torn apart by Yang Zhu and Mo Di; non-action and purity had fallen to Tian Pian and Peng Meng. Thus, Song Keng, Yin Wen, and their followers, hearing the wind, gave free rein to their ideas.

Zhuangzi sought to restore the Way of Confucius, though it was no longer Confucius’ era. He thus spoke loftily of the supreme Dao to correct the world’s baseness, advocated returning to simplicity to sever the world’s extravagance, and embraced emptiness and stillness to rescue the world’s turbidity. Deeming concise words insufficient to remedy its ills, he expounded at length without fixed doctrine; finding solemn speech inadequate to enlighten the vulgar, he indulged in the boundless and unfettered. He composed thirty-three chapters, concluding with “Preserving the Dao in the World.”

His words often exalted Lao Dan above Confucius, and in discussing the learning of the hundred schools, Confucius was not included. He placed Mo Di and Qin Guli’s followers first, then Lao Dan and Guan Yin, before modestly ranking his own learning, and concluded with Hui Shi’s multifarious doctrines. For when the Dao is not at the stage of grand culmination, even the most expansive true person remains partial. Lao Dan’s book grasped the root of Zhuangzi’s thought, thus harmonizing and ascending; Hui Shi’s book grasped only its branches, remaining confined to a single facet.

Alas! Did the books of the various masters not revere Confucius? Yet none understood the basis of that reverence like Zhuangzi. Scholars should seek understanding beyond words.

The *Nanhua Jing* divides its chapters into *Inner* and *Outer*, weaving together the great principles of the Dao, virtue, nature, destiny, ritual, music, punishment, and governance.

The Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship is present herein. Yet its discourse stands lofty and transcendent, distinct from all other masters. Though its ascent proves arduous, leaving it deemed eccentric and extravagant, its depths resound like thunder, its brilliance gleams like moonlight—never to be extinguished.

The *Miscellaneous Chapters* encompass all worldly affairs, employing oblique metaphors and winding analogies, leaving nothing unrecorded. Though Guo Xiang later pruned and restored its fragments, the core of its matters remains largely unchanged. The final chapter, however, critiques all the Daoist arts under heaven as inevitably entangled in deliberate action, their tendencies often skewed—none enduring without flaw. At first reading, it may seem tangled and disordered, its guiding purpose elusive. Yet upon closer examination, its divisions are sharply defined and reasoned: first, the Confucian path; second, the Mohist teachings; third, the art of governance; fourth, the discourse on law; fifth, the praise of Laozi; sixth, the critique of Zhuangzi. Thus, it surveys the arts and defenses of the Way across all ages! It then turns to self-critique, clarifying that its learning derives from Lao Dan.

Given the abundance of its discourse, it fears scholars may mistake words for meaning. Thus, it concludes with an appraisal of Hui Shi, extolling his eloquence while refuting his errors, guiding later generations in their choices. When I first read this scripture in full, upon reaching the section on Hui Shi’s multifarious doctrines, I found no foothold, no boundary—much like the *Liezi*’s account of Gongsun Long deceiving the King of Wei. Such passages defy thought or speech, lingering in the mind for years.

In the *Chunyou* year of *bingwu*, I was fortunate to encounter Master Fan of Wu Yin from Western Shu, who sojourned in the capital. For nearly two years, I attended his lectures, and as we neared the final chapters, I whispered to my fellow students: "This scripture holds many perplexities, but this is its final barrier. I wonder how the master will elucidate it—surely in a manner beyond ordinary perception."

When the scripture’s text was recited, all listened with rapt attention. The master then inquired: "What do you make of this discourse?" The assembly, acknowledging their dullness, begged him to dispel the clouds of confusion. The master replied: "This scripture itself states: *Vast, shifting, strange, and wondrous—all are united in the Dao; let them exist without discussion.*" The students were startled and entreated further instruction. After a long silence, the master asked: "Do you still not understand? This is not a saying of the *Nanhua*; it is precisely the kind of erroneous and misguided speech the text refutes. Why trouble to explain it? From *the greatest having no bounds* to *heaven and earth as one body*—all are the words of Huizi. From *a chicken having three legs* to *ten thousand generations without exhaustion*—these are the matching phrases of his disputatious disciples, practiced in flattery and cunning, vying to outdo one another in strangeness, spouting words without restraint to this extreme. Some, failing to examine closely, mistake these for Zhuangzi’s own words, deepening their doubts and debates—all because they do not trace the source. Master Guo knew this but did not state it plainly, allowing readers to grasp it for themselves. There are those in the world who delight in the strange, bewitched by such bizarre words. They exhaust their minds and thoughts, conjuring strange interpretations to reconcile them, yet though they toil, what benefit is there?"

At this, the assembly’s minds cleared at once, as though a heavy cover had been lifted to reveal the sun and sky. I privately reflected: The sagely teachings handed down to enlighten later generations are as vast as the sea, to be drawn from according to each person’s capacity. The study of commentaries and annotations has its gradations; only by encountering a master’s heart-to-heart transmission can one avoid the confusion of many paths. Otherwise, one remains trapped in Huizi’s phrases, never attaining the *Nanhua*’s transcendent gate. Though one may master countless doctrines and fill five carts with books, one is no more than a debater. As the ancients said: *"To devote oneself to learning is not as good as devoting oneself to seeking a teacher."* How true! The master’s grace is boundless as the heavens. In compiling these explanations, I labored for seven years before completion. With reverence, I kindle incense and bow westward, performing the ninefold rites, as though the venerable Master Wu Yin stood before me, and the radiant spirit of the *Nanhua* Immortal looked down from above.

What I regret is that my fellow students, scattered north and south by upheaval, may have lost some of the master’s teachings I once heard, with no way to verify or correct them—only deep sighs remain. The master’s name was Yingyuan, his courtesy name Shanfu, a native of Shunqing in Shu. His learning encompassed both inner and outer realms, his understanding probed heaven and humanity. Serene and dignified, upright and proper, his every action accorded with ritual—just as the classics describe: *without speaking, he nourished others with harmony; standing beside others, he transformed them.* Esteemed elders of rivers and lakes knew him well; there is no need for further confusion. I briefly record here the circumstances of our master-disciple encounter at the end of this scroll, that later scholars may know the source of this tradition.

Respectfully inscribed in the spring of the *gengwu* year of *Xianchun* by the student Chu Boxiu of Wulin.
