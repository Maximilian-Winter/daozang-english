**Fascicle One of *Imperial Commentary on the Dao and Its Virtue by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang***

**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken"**

"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao."

**Commentary:** The Dao takes "emptiness and pervasiveness" as its meaning, while "constancy" is named for its "profound stillness." This is what is called the "limitless great Dao," the true nature of all beings. Yet when it is said that it "can be spoken," this refers to names and words—those teachings that can be articulated. Though it may be called "speakable," it should adapt to the capacity of the listener, yet any sound or speech remains distinct from the truly constant, serene, and unchanging Dao. The "constant Dao" cannot be debated through names and words, nor grasped by thought and contemplation. Its wonder transcends the subtle and the imperceptible, its principle dwells in the indistinct and the obscure. Thus, only beyond words and images does one align with the constant, true, and tranquil Dao. That which "can be spoken" is not the constant Dao.

"That which can be named is not the constant name."

**Commentary:** "Name" refers to teaching. The earlier phrase "can be spoken" fully illuminates the principle, while "can be named" now clarifies the teaching. Since the true principle is beyond words and images, the ultimate teaching also transcends vocal expression. Just as the principle is the "constant Dao" that cannot be spoken, the teaching is a "name" that is not constant. This is to show that principle and teaching, teaching and principle, are neither identical nor distinct. Yet the profound mystery of the ultimate Dao is unfathomable, neither existing nor non-existing, neither ceasing nor enduring. Its meaning rises and falls, its teaching encompasses gradual and sudden paths. Thus, it establishes "constancy" to break the "speakable," hence the saying: "The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao." In the highest discourse, it resides in the realm of "no can and no cannot." Therefore, the *Scripture of the Jade Capital* states: "No can and no cannot, thought merges with the subtle and imperceptible."

"Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth."

**Commentary:** "Beginning" means origin. The utterly empty and formless Dao shapes and nurtures the myriad things. The Two Modes and Three Luminaries—what do they not arise from? Thus, this "nameless" is designated as the root of all things. That the nameless suffices for speech is evident.

"Named, it is the mother of the myriad things."

**Commentary:** "Mother" refers to the trace of the name. The Dao of Double Mystery is originally nameless. Descending from its origin to its traces, names and designations arise. Thus, the sage establishes names based on the nameless, entrusting the named to expound the nameless. Desiring to nurture and guide all beings, leading them back to their root, its compassionate care and nourishment are akin to a mother’s duty.

"Constantly without desire, observe its wonder."

**Commentary:** "Wonder" means the subtle and profound. "Observe" means to perceive and examine. "Its" refers to oneself. If one can constantly be without desire and without action, utterly empty and utterly still, then one can closely reflect on the wondrous Dao within oneself and distantly perceive the subtlety of the ultimate principle.

"Constantly with desire, observe its manifestations."

**Commentary:** If one cannot be actionless and tranquil, observing the wonder and guarding the true, but instead gives rise to craving and indulges in attachment, then one merely sees the existence of worldly phenomena without realizing the emptiness inherent in existence. Thus, one fails to perceive the subtlety of the wondrous principle and only witnesses the destiny of life and death. The preceding text clarifies the superiority and inferiority of the nameless and the named; this passage reveals the victory and defeat of desire and desirelessness.

"These two emerge together but differ in name."

**Commentary:** The observed realm is singular, but the wisdom of the observer differs. Since the two observations are not the same, the manifestations and wonders thus bear different names.

"They are together called the wonder."

**Commentary:** "Mystery" signifies the profound and remote, and is also a name for non-attachment. The two minds of existence and non-existence originate from the one Dao, emerging together yet differing in name. The one Dao with differing names is called "profound and remote." The profound and remote mystery returns to non-attachment. Neither attached to existence nor to non-existence, and not attached to either, it is thus called "mystery."

"Mystery upon mystery."

**Commentary:** Those with desire are attached to existence; those without desire are attached to non-existence. Thus, one "mystery" is spoken to dispel both attachments. Yet fearing that practitioners may become attached to this "mystery," another "mystery" is spoken to remove the subsequent affliction. Thus, one is not only unattached to attachment but also unattached to non-attachment. This is to dispel and dispel again, hence "mystery upon mystery."

"The gate of all wonders."

**Commentary:** "Gate" means the Dharma-gate. The preceding "mystery within the one" dispels the dual attachments of the two extremes. Once the afflictions of the two extremes are removed, the medicine of the one center is also dispelled. Only when medicine and affliction are simultaneously dissolved does one reach the utmost subtlety, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature. This is not merely the gateway of all sages but also the Dharma-gate of all wonders.

**Chapter Two: "When All Under Heaven Know"**

"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty..."

**Commentary:** "The wondrous and the putrid," as in the *Zhuangzi*'s "Knowledge Wanders North" chapter, where the Yellow Emperor says to Knowledge: "The myriad things are one. What they deem wondrous is called the marvelous; what they despise is called the putrid." "Long and short take shape in contrast."

**Commentary:** The passage on the wild duck’s legs being short and the crane’s legs being long appears in the *Zhuangzi*’s eighth chapter, "Webbed Toes." "Thus the sage."

**Commentary:** Generally speaking, sages may be categorized into five types. The first are the sages who attain the Dao: the Most High Lord Lao and the great sages of the heavens. The second are those who hold the throne of All Under Heaven and also attain the immortality of the transcendent: Fu Xi, the Yellow Emperor, Zhuan Xu, Shao Hao, Yao, and Shun. The third are those who hold the throne of All Under Heaven but do not attain the immortality of the transcendent: Tang of Yin and Kings Wen and Wu. Though they brought clarity to the six directions, they did not speak of ascending to heaven. The fourth are the broadly accomplished sages who lack the throne of All Under Heaven: the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, who created rites and music, setting models for a hundred kings, yet held no position of the nine fives. Still, they possessed the virtue of uniting heaven and earth. The fifth are those with singular excellence, lacking the reputation of broad accomplishment, yet still embodying all the virtues above: Bo Ya and Shi Wen, sages of the zither; Zi Qing and Sui Ming, sages of weiqi; Zhong Qi and Yan Zhou, sages of discerning tones; Han E and Qin Qing, sages of song; Gong Shu and Wen Zhi, sages of wise governance; Li Zhu and Shi Kuang, sages of sight and hearing; Zhang Zhi and Zhong Yao, sages of cursive script. In the present age, the enlightened are the sages who order All Under Heaven. "The myriad things arise, yet he does not refuse them."

**Commentary:** The "striking the earth and drumming the belly" refers to the *Zhuangzi*...

The passage is from the "Horse's Hoof" chapter. "Achieving success without claiming credit."

**Commentary:** "Day by day, ever more cautious" is a line from the *Book of Documents*. Now, regarding achievements: royal achievements are called *meritorious deeds*, such as those of the Duke of Zhou, who aided in establishing the king’s enterprise. National achievements are called *accomplishments*, such as those of Yi Yin, who preserved and protected the state. Civil achievements are called *service*, such as those of Hou Ji, who enacted laws for the people. Affairs of merit are called *labor*, such as those of Yu of Xia, who stabilized the realm through toil. Governance achievements are called *distinction*, such as those of Gao Yao, who established laws and brought order. Military achievements are called *abundance*, such as those of Han Xin, who vanquished enemies with ingenuity. Now, the enlightened achieve *profound merit*—their accomplishments are called "profound" for their depth and remoteness. When the ruler is not reckless in joy or anger, punishments and rewards are not excessive, and warfare does not arise. When not reckless in seeking or taking, banditry and levies are not heavy, and provisions are not burdensome. When not reckless in love or aversion, appointments and dismissals are always fitting, and the worthy are distinguished from the unworthy. When not reckless in favoring attendants, those to the left and right, before and behind, are all upright. When not reckless in matters of land, weapons do not leave their sheaths, and soldiers do not toil. When not reckless toward the myriad peoples, All Under Heaven is at peace.

"Dense as hair, straight as a thread" is from the *Poetry*—the *Xiao Ya*, "Dignified Gentlemen." It speaks of a nature so refined and conduct so upright that, like hair from root to tip, there is no variation in its integrity.

**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Worthy**
"Not exalting the worthy causes the people not to contend."

**Commentary:** "Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger" is from the *Book of Changes*—Confucius’ explanation of the line "Flying dragon in the heavens" in the *Qian* hexagram’s nine in the fifth place. When the flying dragon is in the heavens, it responds to and influences all things, just as water flows toward the damp and fire burns toward the dry. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger—each aligns with its kind, naturally responding to one another. How much more so when the emperor ascends to the nine-fives position and the myriad states come to court? "When the sage acts, the ten thousand things behold him." That which is rooted in heaven inclines upward; that which is rooted in earth inclines downward. Water is yin, and when it flows upon the earth, it must seek damp places. Fire is yang, and when it burns upon kindling, it must seek dry places. These two things, lacking awareness or intent, still respond through qi in this way. Moreover, the dragon is a water creature, and clouds are the qi of water—when the dragon roars, auspicious clouds arise. The tiger is a beast of majestic ferocity, and wind is a thing of vibration—when the tiger howls, valley winds stir. These two, though possessing awareness and intent, are not like the sage descending into the world, the flying dragon in the heavens, where sage and worthy depend upon one another, and the ten thousand things intermingle in resonance. Thus, the text broadly sets forth these examples.

During the reigns of Tang and Yu, there was no lack of ministers of the highest caliber. When Yi and Lü ascended to court, they naturally attained the esteem of the empire’s pillars. Tang refers to Tang Yao, styled Taotang, of the Yi Xi clan, named Fangxun. From youth, he possessed sagely virtue. He ruled from Ji, and at eighty-six, knowing his son Danzhu to be unworthy, he sought widely among the obscure for one of virtue. He thus elevated Shun and tested him over time, betrothing his two daughters to observe his conduct. After two years, he abdicated to Shun. Shun reigned for twenty-eight years before Yao passed away, living to one hundred seventeen. He was buried in Chengyangli of Jiyin. The rules of posthumous naming declare that one who "excellently transmits sagacity" is called Yao.

Shun, of the Youyu clan, was tested for two years before ascending the throne. Twenty-eight years after Yao’s passing, Shun, at thirty, was employed in governance. He acted as regent for twenty-eight years, observed three years of mourning, and ruled as Son of Heaven for fifty years. He died while touring the southern lands in the wilds of Cangwu, living to one hundred twelve. Deeming his son Shangjun unworthy, he commanded Yu to succeed him and was buried in Lingling of Jiuyi.

The *Daoist Learning* states that Yao became the Perfected Lord of the Grand Tenuity, and Shun became the Perfected Lord of the Grand Ultimate.

The *yuan* and *kai* refer to the Eight Yuans and Eight Kais. In ancient times, Gaoxin had eight talented sons: Bo He, Zhong Kan, Shu Xian, Ji Zhong, Bo Hu, Zhong Xiong, Shu Bao, and Ji Li. Loyal, reverent, respectful, and refined, they spread kindness, benevolence, and harmony. The people of the world called them the Eight Yuans. *Su* means reverence; *yi*, beauty; *xuan*, pervasiveness; *yuan*, goodness. Gaoyang had eight talented sons: Cangshu, Suiyin, Daoyin, Dalin, Longjiang, Tingjian, Zhongrong, and Shuda. Centered in sagacity, broad and profound, clear and sincere, steadfast and honest, the people of the world called them the Eight Kais. *Qi* means centered; *yuan*, profound.

"Yun" means trustworthiness; "du," sincerity and depth. "Kai" means harmony.

These sixteen clans perpetuated their excellence through the ages, their names never falling into obscurity. Yet Yao did not trust and employ them, instead elevating Shun as his minister and dispatching the Eight Yuans to disseminate the Five Teachings across the four directions. The Five Teachings are: fathers righteous, mothers compassionate, elder brothers kind, younger brothers respectful, and children filial—thus inner harmony and outer accomplishment are achieved.

The descendants of Emperor Gaoxin were the scions of the Eight Yuans, namely Hou Ji, Xie, Zhu Hu, and Xiong Pi and their peers. The Eight Kais were appointed to oversee the Earth Lord, regulating all affairs so that none were out of order, the earth harmonized and heaven perfected. The titles of Gaoyang and Zhuanxu belonged to the descendants of the Eight Kais, such as Chui, Yu, Gao Yao, and Yi and their peers. Gao Yao, styled Tingjian, was among them.

Xie served as Minister of Education, administering the Five Teachings with leniency—he ranked among the Eight Yuans. Yu served as Minister of Works, governing water and earth, and thus held the office of Earth Lord—he ranked among the Eight Kais.

"Inner harmony" refers to the central domains; "outer accomplishment," to the barbarian frontiers. When Shun elevated the sixteen clans, the world was well governed, and peace prevailed within and without.

As for Yi and Lü: Yi was Yi Yin, born by the Yi River amidst the hollow mulberry. He assisted Yin as its prime minister, aiding Tai Jia, and was called the Grand Tutor. His ancestor Yi Zhi had aided Tang in establishing the altars of state, bringing about great peace. Yi Yin’s son, Yi She, assisted Tai Wu, grandson of Tai Jia, and the achievements of these three ministers shone in the Yin court.

Lü was the Grand Duke Wang, surnamed Jiang and styled Ziya. He fished at Pan Stream, catching a great fish, and upon cutting it open, found a jade tablet within, inscribed with military chimes. Ziya studied it. Though over eighty years of age, when King Wen of Zhou divined while hunting by the Wei River, the oracle declared: "Neither bear nor brown bear—only the king’s teacher." Thus he hunted and obtained Ziya, returning with him in his chariot. Ziya aided Zhou with merit and was first enfeoffed at Lü or Fu. After the conquest of Yin, he was enfeoffed with the state of Qi. The Duke of Zhao commanded the Grand Duke, saying: "The five ranks of nobles and the nine lords—you shall subdue them to flank and assist the House of Zhou." The Grand Duke’s domain was granted: east to the sea, west to the Yellow River, south to Mu Pass, and north to Wu Di.

Later, Duke Huan of Qi, Xiaobai, became the leader of the feudal lords. By the end of the Spring and Autumn period, his minister Tian He moved Duke Kang of Qi to the seacoast and seized his state.

The "lofty gaze of the Grand Tutor" refers to the Son of Heaven appointing the Three Dukes to assist the Three Terraces. The Three Terraces and Six Ministers are: the Grand Commandant, the Minister of Education, the Minister of Works, the Grand Preceptor, the Grand Tutor, and the Grand Protector. The Three Terraces are six stars—two stars each for the upper, middle, and lower terraces—located south of the Purple Tenuity, encircling the imperial throne. They extend from Wen Chang to Tai Wei and Tian Jie, governing the Three Dukes, the nine ministers, the scholar-officials, and the nine provinces. When their color is bright and their ranks orderly, ruler and minister are in harmony, and laws are just.

From the upper terrace to the middle terrace spans sixteen degrees; from the middle to the lower terrace, another sixteen degrees. The distance between two stars is half a degree. If too wide, it portends extravagance; if too narrow, oppression. The upper star governs the Son of Heaven; the middle star, the feudal lords and the Di barbarians; the lower star, the ministers and great officers. A small curve with clarity is auspicious; trembling or discoloration is inauspicious. If one star departs, the realm is in peril; if two depart, the realm is in chaos; if three depart, the realm cannot be governed.

The Grand Preceptor serves as the model for one, the exemplar for the myriad states. The Grand Tutor instructs in virtue and righteousness. The Grand Protector safeguards the ruler’s person. The Grand Commandant commands the military; the Minister of Education reverently spreads the Five Teachings; the Minister of Works governs the regulation of water and earth. These Three Dukes correspond to the Three Terraces above.

The Grand Tutor: "A" means reliance; "heng," balance. The Son of Heaven relies on the Three Dukes to bring balance and rectitude to the world. He does not prize rare and precious goods.

**Commentary:** Those devoid of humaneness sever the true nature of life and destiny, coveting wealth and honor—this is the text from *Zhuangzi*, "Webbed Toes," Chapter Eight. "Not seeing what may be desired keeps the mind from disorder."

**Exegesis:** The lesser recluse hides in the mountains; the greater recluse dwells in the marketplace. Yet if one cannot extinguish desire, one fears being ensnared by circumstances and thus retreats to the mountains and forests to avoid what is seen. But when the mind is stilled and thoughts calmed, when contemplation is directed toward what is upright and true, when no external distractions disturb the heart and the inner resolve remains serene and harmonious—then, though one may be amidst the bustling court and marketplace, chasing fame and profit, it does not touch the heart; though one may tread the dusty paths of the world, entangled in right and wrong, it does not trouble the mind. Mingling with the crowds of the city, one diminishes and refines the self in the pursuit of truth.

"Empty the heart."
**Commentary:** "An empty room gives rise to brightness"—this is from *Zhuangzi*, "The Human World," Chapter Four. "Fill the belly."
**Annotation:** "Eat to satiety and then stop"—these are the words of Yan Mo and Ru Kuan, admonishing Wei Wuzi, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* is the name of Lu’s historical records. Chroniclers arranged events by day, days by month, months by season, and seasons by year. Since a year comprises four seasons, the title combines these terms. The Son of Heaven had court historians; the feudal lords had state historians. In Chu, it was called the *Tao Wu*; in Jin, the *Cheng*; in Lu, the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Confucius composed the classic, and Zuo Qiuming wrote the commentary, beginning in the forty-eighth year of King Ping of Zhou, the first year of Duke Yin of Lu, in the *ding-si* year of the sexagenary cycle, when the star was in *Jiang Lou*. This corresponded to the second year of Marquis E of Jin, the thirteenth year of Duke Huan of Wei (Wan), the twenty-eighth year of Duke Xuan of Cai (Kaofu), the twenty-second year of Duke Zhuang of Zheng (Wusheng), the thirty-fifth year of Duke Huan of Cao (Zhongsheng), the ninth year of Duke Xi of Qi (Lufu), the nineteenth year of King Wu of Chu (Da), the forty-fourth year of Duke Wen of Qin, the seventh year of Duke Mu of Song (He), the twenty-third year of Duke Huan of Chen (Bao), and the eighteenth year of Duke Mu of Yan. This was the first year of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. It concluded in the fourteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, the thirty-ninth year of King Jing of Zhou, in the *wu-wu* year, spanning 242 years, covering fourteen Zhou kings and twelve Lu dukes.

The events of this period corresponded to the thirty-first year of Duke Ding of Jin (Wu), the twelfth year of Duke Chu of Wei (Zhe), the tenth year of Duke Cheng of Cai (Yi), the twentieth year of Duke Sheng of Zheng, the fourth year of Duke Jian of Qi (Jia), the eighth year of King Hui of Chu (Zhang), the eleventh year of Duke Dao of Qin, the thirty-sixth year of Duke Jing of Song (Touman), the twenty-first year of Duke Min of Chen (Yue), the sixth year of Duke Jing of Yan, and the fifteenth year of King Fuchai of Wu. This was the year the *Spring and Autumn Annals* concluded with the capture of the lin.

The work comprises thirty scrolls, totaling 352,025 characters, with 194,590 distinct graphs. The original text contained 157,966 characters, and the commentary was written by Du Yu, styled Yuan Kai, General of the Southern Expedition of Jin.

As for Yan Mo and Ru Kuan: In the twenty-eighth year of Duke Zhao of Lu’s reign, Wei Xianzi (Shu) of Jin held power and appointed his son, Wu, as the grandee of *Gengyang* (present-day Jinyang). In winter, *Gengyang* had a legal dispute that Wu could not resolve, so he submitted the case to Xianzi. The chief litigant of the plaintiff’s clan offered female musicians as a bribe, and Xianzi was about to accept it. Wu said to Xianzi’s two ministers, Yan Mo and Ru Kuan: "Our lord is known among the feudal lords for his incorruptibility. If he accepts the bribe from *Gengyang*, there is no greater greed." He urged them to admonish Xianzi. Both agreed and, after the court session, waited in the courtyard. When the feast was served, Xianzi summoned the two ministers to dine. As the dishes were being set, they sighed three times. After eating, they were seated, and Xianzi asked: "I have heard from my uncles the saying, ‘Only when eating does one forget sorrow.’ Why did you sigh three times as the food was placed?" They replied in unison: "Another has given us two men wine, and we did not eat until evening. When the feast first arrived, we feared it would be insufficient, hence the first sigh. As the dishes were set, we reproached ourselves, thinking, ‘Could it be that the general’s meal is inadequate?’ Thus the second sigh. By the end of the feast, we wished to take our bellies as the hearts of gentlemen—eating to satiety and then stopping—hence the third sigh." Xianzi then declined the bribe from *Gengyang*. "Xian" is a posthumous title; Wuzi’s given name was Ke, and his posthumous title was Wu.

"Act without acting, and nothing will be left ungoverned."
**Commentary:** "Without sound and without scent"—people naturally do not recognize or know it. "Without sound and without scent" is from the *Book of Songs*, "Greater Odes," "King Wen," which speaks of the Dao of Heaven as difficult to know. The ears do not hear sound; the nose does not detect fragrance. By emulating King Wen’s deeds, the world naturally trusts and submits. "Not recognizing, not knowing" is from the *Book of Songs*, "Greater Odes," "Huang Yi," which says that people do not recognize the past or know the present but follow the laws of Heaven in their actions.

**Exegesis:** The principle of non-action is vast indeed. Non-action does not mean pulling without drawing near, pushing without sending away, pressing without response, moving without stirring, stagnating without flowing, or grasping without dispersing. Rather, it means that private ambitions do not intrude upon the public Dao, that desires do not distort upright methods, that actions are taken in accordance with principle, and that achievements are built upon existing resources. When affairs are accomplished, the self does not boast; when merit is established, the name is not claimed. For instance, water requires boats, sand requires sleds, mud requires poles, mountains require ladders, summer channels and winter reservoirs—cultivating fields on high ground and creating ponds in low places—these are not what I call "action" but rather "non-action."

The sage’s non-action lies in following and entrusting to subordinates, holding them accountable without laboring, devising plans without error, and undertaking tasks without omission. Words become literary works; conduct becomes a model. Advancing and retreating are timely; movement and stillness follow principle. Beauty and ugliness are not loved or hated; rewards and punishments are not given in joy or anger. Names are self-assigned; categories are self-applied. Affairs arise naturally, not from oneself. Following the seasons of Heaven, the nature of Earth, and the hearts of people—thus do all ministers, worthy and unworthy alike, each fulfill their roles. The ruler attains the means to govern ministers; ministers attain the means to serve the ruler. This is the Dao of governing the state through non-action.

**Chapter Four: The Dao Is Empty**

The Dao was before the image of the Emperor.

*Commentary:* "The Emperor emerges from Zhen," as stated in the *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes*. Zhen is the trigram of the east, the qi of lesser yang, the source of generation and transformation. Now, the Crown Prince resides in the Eastern Palace, the position of lesser yang, and ascends the throne at the time of "emerging from Zhen," taking as its model the beginning of Heaven and Earth’s nurturing of the myriad things. That which manifests is called "image"; that which is formless is called "qi"—the origin of all living things. The Great Dao exists even before the image of the Emperor, speaking to its loftiness and remoteness.

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth**

[Heaven and Earth] regard the myriad things as straw dogs.

*Commentary:* Binding grass into the form of a dog for use in sacrifices is recorded in the "Revolutions of Heaven" chapter of the *Zhuangzi*. *Annotation:* "The kindness of worn-out curtains," as the *Record of Rites* in the "Tan Gong" chapter states: When Confucius’s dog died, he sent Zigong to bury it, saying, "I have heard that one does not discard worn-out curtains, and so they are used to bury horses. When the ruler’s carriage horse dies, it is buried with a curtain. One does not discard worn-out canopies, and so they are used to bury dogs. I am poor and have no canopy; when you seal the grave, give it a mat so that its head does not sink into the earth, lest it lie directly in the soil."

**Chapter Seven: Heaven Is Enduring, Earth Is Everlasting**

The sage places himself behind yet stands outside himself.

*Exegesis:* Shattering the amber pillow, burning the pheasant-feathered robe, halting the expenditure of a single terrace, refusing horses from a thousand *li*—his virtue endures in his age, his name shines in bamboo and silk.

**Chapter Eight: The Highest Virtue Is Like Water**

In governance, the good [ruler] brings order.

**Exegesis:** "To rectify one’s bearing and awaken things" is a passage from *Zhuangzi*, Chapter 21, "Tian Zifang." Zifang’s given name was Wuze. He served as an attendant to Marquis Wen of Wei, who studied under Zixia and befriended Zifang. Zifang often spoke of the Way of the Valley Master, leading Marquis Wen to assume the Valley Master was Zifang’s teacher. Zifang replied: "Not so. He is but a man of my village, whose frequent and apt references to the Way led me to cite him. My true teacher is Dongguo Shunzi. In his conduct, he embodies the human form yet aligns with Heaven, preserves authenticity through emptiness and compliance, remains pure while accommodating all things. When things lack the Way, he rectifies his bearing to awaken them, dissolving their intentions. How could one like me be worthy of praising him? Truly, it is by not contending that one remains without fault."

**Exegesis:** The virtue of non-contention is the foremost of virtues. By nature, people cannot be without contention, and the causes of contention are manifold: rebellion and insurrection, violence and arrogance, wrath and fury, extravagance and excess, boasting and self-aggrandizement, dominance and esteem, defiance and rivalry, advancement and acquisition, courage and cowardice, love and hatred, willfulness and indulgence, favoritism toward wives—all breed strife. Should a king harbor even one of these, he will raise armies across the land. Should a feudal lord harbor even one, war will engulf his state. Should a minister or grandee harbor even one, his household will fall to ruin. Should a scholar or commoner harbor even one, harm will befall his person. All arise from thoughtlessness, transgression of rites and laws, lack of awe, and failure to endure. Thus, those who contend for cities fill them with the slain; those who contend for land cover the fields with corpses. One must examine the roots of contention and block its source—then all will be well-ordered.

**Chapter Nine: Holding and Filling**

Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them.

**Exegesis:** If one indulges in unceasing greed, gold and jade may indeed fill the hall, yet this is like the elephant whose tusks bring about its burning, or the sacrificial fowl whose tail is severed in fear. One loses the treasure of non-attachment and invites the calamity of bandits. How can such a one be said to possess them? The elephant’s tusks lead to its burning: in the twenty-fourth year of Duke Xiang of *Chunqiu*, Fan Xuanzi of Jin governed the state. The burdens imposed on the feudal lords grew heavy, and the people of Zheng suffered. In the second month, the Earl of Zheng traveled to Jin, and Zichan lodged a letter with Zixi to present to Xuanzi, saying: "You govern Jin, yet the neighboring lords hear not of your virtuous command but only of your heavy exactions. I am perplexed. I have heard that the lord of a state and family fears not the lack of wealth but the difficulty of a good name. When the wealth of the feudal lords is amassed in the public treasury, the lords grow disloyal. If you rely on this, Jin itself will grow disloyal." *Note: Disloyalty means division.* "If the lords grow disloyal, Jin will collapse; if Jin grows disloyal, your own house will collapse. Why this haste? What use is wealth? A good name is the chariot of virtue, and virtue is the foundation of the state. With a foundation, there is no collapse. Should you not attend to this? With virtue comes joy, and with joy, endurance. As the *Book of Songs* says: 'Joy abides in the noble man, the foundation of state and family—this is good virtue.' Cultivate forbearance to illuminate virtue, and let a good name carry it forth. Thus, distant lands will come, and near lands will be at peace. Would you rather have people say, 'You truly give me life,' or 'You drain me to sustain yourself'?" *Note: To drain means to take; he speaks of taking their wealth to sustain oneself.* "The elephant’s tusks bring about its burning—this is wealth." Xuanzi was pleased and lightened the exactions. This journey of the Earl of Zheng to Jin was due to the burden of heavy exactions.

The cock that severs its own tail—In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, when Prince Cha of King Jing of Zhou’s lineage, Bin Meng, journeyed to the outskirts, he saw a rooster cut off its own tail and sighed: "The use of sacrificial beasts lies in their wholeness and plumpness. Now, by severing its tail, it renders itself incomplete, hoping to escape being used as a sacrifice. If even a cock preserves its body thus, how much more should man?" Those who covet profit forget themselves; their wisdom does not match that of a cock.

The man who treasured non-greed—There was a man of Zheng who obtained a piece of jade and offered it to Zihan, saying, "This is a treasure. I intend to present it to you." Zihan replied, "You regard jade as treasure; I regard non-greed as treasure. If I were to take the jade, we would both lose our treasure. It is better that we each preserve our own." Thus, he refused the jade.

Those who invite bandits—The *Yijing*, in the *Jie* hexagram’s third line, states: "Carrying a burden while riding in a carriage invites bandits to come." Carrying burdens is the work of petty men; riding in carriages is the instrument of noble ones. Abandoning small tasks for great ones is something things do not grant—thus, bandits and thieves plunder them.

Achieving merit and securing fame—The meaning is this: averting disaster and eliminating calamity is merit; wealth, honor, nobility, and glory are fame. When the high-flying birds are gone, the fine bow is put away; when the cunning hare is dead, the hunting dog is cooked—such is the way of power. Fan Li escaped disaster by drifting away in a small boat, while Wen Zhong clung to his position and lost his life—this is what it means. The sun at its zenith begins to decline; the moon at its fullness begins to wane. Zhang Liang abstained from grain to wander in leisure; Shu Guang resigned his seal to pursue loftiness. Thus, they were spared the later regrets of Shangcai and Huating.

**Chapter Ten: Carrying the Po-Soul**

"Carrying the po-soul."—The *Commentary* states: Thus, Zichan of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* said: "At the beginning of human life, what is formed is called the *po*." In the seventh year of Duke Zhao of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, when Bo You of Zheng first held power, Si Dai killed him. The people of Zheng were alarmed, saying, "Bo You has come!" Some dreamed of Bo You in armor, saying, "On the *renzi* day, I will kill Dai." The next year, he killed Duan. On the *renzi* day, Si Dai died; the following year, Gongsun Duan died. The people of Zheng grew even more fearful. Someone asked Zichan, "Can Bo You still become a ghost?" Zichan replied, "In human life, the yin is called *po*, and the yang is called *hun*. When one consumes much of the essence of things, the *hun* and *po* grow strong. Even common men and women who die violently can have their *hun* and *po* cling to people, becoming malevolent spirits—how much more so Bo You, who held the reins of government for three generations and died violently? Would it not be fitting for him to become a powerful spirit?" Bo You was a descendant of Duke Mu, the grandson of Ziliang, and the son of Zi’er—hence, "three generations." Zichan installed Ziliang’s son, Liang Zhi, to appease him, and the disturbances ceased.

"Let not the heart of one near death return to yang"—This is a phrase from the *Zhuangzi*’s *Qi Wu* chapter.

The three *hun* are named Tai Guang, Shuang Ling, and You Jing. The seven *po* are: Corpse Dog, Crouching Arrow, Sparrow Yin, Swallowing Thief, Removing Filth, Stinking Lung, and Flying Poison—these come from the *Shangqing* texts.

Cherishing the people and governing the state—The meaning is this: the people are the foundation of the state; non-action is the transformation of the Dao.

With the transformative power of non-action, one nurtures and cherishes the people, and the foundation of the state is secured. If governance is oppressive and harsh, it becomes tyranny. Heavy taxes and onerous corvée labor harm the people’s nature. If labor is not timed appropriately, it disrupts agriculture. If frugality is not practiced, grain is squandered.

The Opening and Closing of Heaven’s Gate—
This means: in administering the affairs of cherishing the people and governing the state, even a ruler who "wears robes facing south" must still reverently serve Heaven and align with the celestial reckoning—referring to the mandate of succession and the cycles of the Five Movements. When Shun commanded Yu, he said: "The celestial reckoning rests in your person; may the heavenly emolument endure forever." This means that when the reckoning rests in one’s person, one receives the Mandate of Heaven, and thus may treasure it as the great treasure—this is called the Treasured Mandate. When it is conferred by Heaven, it is called "receiving the Mandate from Heaven." The *Xici* of the *Yijing* states: "The great treasure of the sage is called position."

When Heaven’s Gate opens, extraordinary auspices descend: a yellow star stirs with radiance, a red vapor manifests as a sign, purple qi fills the court, the Five Stars gather in the Well constellation, a flowing rainbow pierces the moon, fire and lightning coil around the celestial pivot. Then, the sacred peaks send forth spirits, and ministers of state are born to assist and protect. Thus, one responds to Heaven, aligns with the people, rescues all beings, eliminates harm, and receives the celestial reckoning to possess the realm.

Yet when governance is misguided, punishments and policies deviate from propriety, the multitudes rebel, kin turn away, armies clash, and calamities arise—when rebellion stirs below, omens appear above. The sun darkens, mountains collapse, rivers run dry, disasters and misfortunes swarm like bees, and the state perishes. This is the opening and closing of Heaven’s Gate. The alternation of opening and closing is called "transformation." The *Xici* of the *Yijing* states: it refers to the cyclical interplay of opening and closing, the alternating arrival of yin and yang, and the principle of mutual dependence.

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**
Commentary: Qian and Kun are the great vessels of the *Yi*. This refers to the *Xici* of the *Yijing*. It clarifies that the establishment of the *Yi* is rooted in Qian and Kun. If Qian and Kun did not exist, the Way of the *Yi* would have no means to arise.

Thirty spokes share a single hub.
Commentary: The mutual interaction of the many apertures—this is from the second chapter of the *Zhuangzi*.

Clay is molded to make vessels.
Commentary: The potter—*The Book of Documents* states: "To shape earth is called 'pottery.'" When Shun was of humble station, he tilled the fields at Li Mountain and made pottery by the riverbank.

Doors and windows are cut to make a chamber.
Commentary: *The Book of Songs* states: "They dug caves and made pottery." The *Zhuangzi* says: "When a chamber has no empty space, mother and daughter-in-law quarrel." "Digging caves and making pottery"—the *Mian Mian* poem in the "Decade of King Wen" of the *Book of Songs* states: "Gu Gong Danfu dug caves and made pottery, having no proper dwellings." Gu Gong was the Lord of Bin. *Gu* means "ancient." *Dan* is the honorific for a lord; he was the grandfather of King Wen and dwelt in Bin. "Mother and daughter-in-law quarrel"—*xi* means "path," and *bo* means "anger." The Outer Chapters of the *Zhuangzi* state: "When a chamber is not empty, paths become narrow and cramped, and people fight over the way, losing the proper conduct of women."

Thus, that which exists is for utility, while that which does not exist is for function.
Commentary: The meaning of "above form" and "below form"—"Above form" refers to the root of the Dao, the realm of pure emptiness and non-action, which resides above. "Below form" refers to the function of the Dao, where material substance flows into form and resides below. The function of the Dao is manifested through form in things; things receive material substance, and thus are called "vessels." Vessels are the categories of things with form. The sage models the function of the Dao to create vessels: carving hexagrams to devise writing, hollowing wood to make boats, sharpening wood to make oars, cutting wood to make pestles, digging earth to make mortars, bending wood to make bows, sharpening wood to make arrows, constructing palaces and halls, weaving nets and traps, harnessing oxen and riding horses to carry heavy loads over long distances, casting metal into weapons, raising poles as banners, hewing wood into plows, and fashioning wood into plow handles—all these and more are devised to benefit the world. These are all divisions of the Dao’s function, made into vessels, as described in the *Xici* of the *Yijing*. Here, the Dao is the name for that which has no form, while form is the function of that which has substance. All things arise from nothingness, and the myriad forms are established by the Dao. The Dao precedes form, and form follows the Dao. The Dao is above form, and form is below the Dao. Thus, that which is "above form" is called the Dao, and that which is "below form" is called a vessel. Though form resides at the boundary between Dao and vessel, it belongs to the realm of vessels, not the Dao. Since it possesses material substance and can serve as a vessel, it is called "that which is below form and is called a vessel."

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**
The five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deafen the ears; the five flavors dull the palate.
Commentary: The five tones—according to Liu Xiang of the Han: *Gong* is the center, the virtue of the ruler. *Shang* is "manifest," the manifestation of things. *Jiao* is "sprout," the arising of things. *Zhi* is "blessing," the flourishing and great abundance of things. *Yu* is "gathering," the gathering and storing of things.

The five colors—according to Wang Shushi: pure white silk, dyed with indigo, becomes blue; with cinnabar, becomes red; with *nie*, becomes yellow; with black dye, becomes black—thus forming the five colors. The five colors were established to manifest the images of the Five Phases and distinguish the adornments of the noble and the base. The five tones were established to harmonize the qi of Heaven and Earth and manifest the sounds of the Five Phases. The five flavors were established to manifest the harmony of the Five Phases and nourish humanity. If one indulges in these two matters, does it not lead to deafness, blindness, and a dulled palate? In the struggle over flavors, there was the disaster of the mutton stew and the resolution of the turtle soup.

The mutton stew—In the second year of Duke Huan of Lu, Gongzi Guisheng of Zheng, on the orders of the Viscount of Chu, attacked Song. Hua Yuan and Yue Ju of Song led their forces to resist. On the *renzi* day of the second month, they battled at Da Ji. Before the battle, Hua Yuan slaughtered sheep to feed his troops, but his charioteer, Yang Zhen, was not included. During the battle, Yang Zhen said: "Yesterday’s mutton was your command; today’s battle is mine." He drove into the Zheng forces, and the Song army was utterly defeated. The Zheng troops captured Hua Yuan and seized Yue Ju, along with 460 chariots, 250 prisoners, and 100 severed ears.

The state of Song sent a hundred war chariots and a hundred teams of four horses with patterned coats to ransom Hua Yuan from Zheng. When half the ransom had been delivered, Hua Yuan escaped and returned. He stood outside the gate of his home, announced his arrival, and only then entered. Seeing Yang Zhen, he said, "It was your horses that did it." Yang Zhen replied, "Not the horses—it was the man." After this exchange, Yang Zhen, whose courtesy name was Shu□, fled to Lu.

The noble man says: Yang Zhen was no true man, for he let private resentment bring ruin to his state and destruction to its people—what greater crime could there be? As the *Xiao Ya* says of one "without goodness," does it not refer to Yang Zhen? He gratified himself by harming the people.

As for the resolution of the turtle soup—In the fourth year of Duke Xuan, the people of Chu presented a giant turtle to Duke Ling of Zheng (the eldest son of Duke Mu, named Yi). When the duke’s brothers, Gongzi Zigong (styled Zong) and Gongzi Zijia (Guisheng), were about to enter for an audience, Zigong’s second finger twitched. He showed it to Zijia and said, "Whenever this happens, I am sure to taste some rare delicacy." Upon entering, they saw the steward preparing to carve the turtle and exchanged knowing smiles. The duke asked the reason, and Zijia told him. When the turtle was served to the ministers, the duke summoned Zigong but did not give him any. Enraged, Zigong dipped his finger into the cauldron, tasted the soup, and left. The duke flew into a rage and sought to kill him. Zigong and Zijia plotted to strike first. Zijia said, "Even an old beast kept long in the stables is spared from slaughter—how much more a lord?" But then he turned and slandered Zijia. Fearing the consequences, Zijia went along with the plan. In summer, they killed Duke Ling. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records: "Gongzi Guisheng of Zheng killed his lord Yi."

The reason was insufficient authority. Zijia lacked the power to restrain Zigong, and in fear of slander, he followed along in regicide. Thus, the record names him first as the chief culprit.

The noble man says: To be humane but not martial is to lack the means to keep harm at a distance. Zijia’s initial reference to the "old beast" was humane, but his failure to punish Zigong was a lack of martial resolve. Unable to uphold the Way of humanity, he fell into the infamy of regicide—though in truth, it was Zigong’s dipping of his finger that brought about this disaster.

**Galloping and Hunting**
The annotation states: "Those who govern the state with their hearts" is a phrase from the second chapter of the *Zhuangzi*’s "Inner Chapters."

The principle holds: According to ritual, the Son of Heaven and the feudal lords hunt thrice each year—first, to procure dried meats for the ancestral temple sacrifices; second, to entertain guests and foster relations between states; and third, to stock the lord’s kitchen with seasonal provisions. To hunt at the proper time is respectful; to hunt out of season is tyranny. Thus, the spring *sou*, summer *miao*, autumn *mi*, and winter *shou* hunts all await the lull in farming to train martial affairs. Before the otter has offered its fish, nets and traps are not cast into the rivers. Before the dhole has offered its prey, snares are not set in the fields. Before the hawk and falcon have struck, mist nets are not spread in the forests. By observing the rites of offering game and practicing the benevolence of the "three drives," one aligns with the seasons.

In the second month of spring, the Son of Heaven instructs the troops and then hunts; in the second month of summer, he teaches the *fu* field rites and then conducts the *miao* hunt; in the second month of autumn, he drills the army and then conducts the *mi* hunt; in the second month of winter, he reviews the grand muster and then conducts the *shou* hunt. The Grand Marshal oversees these affairs, while the mountain and marsh wardens fulfill their duties—all to instruct the people in martial matters.

Yet some disregard these ancient precedents, indulging in reckless hunting that devastates creatures and seizes the seasons, staying afield for a hundred days without return. Their unchecked galloping leads to madness: the people resent them, the state is imperiled, and disaster follows from the breach of ritual.

---

**Rare and Coveted Goods**
The commentary notes: "Those who deviate from Heaven’s balance"—Zhuangzi says: "Beginning and end are like a ring, with no discernible starting point—this is called Heaven’s equality." Heaven’s equality is Heaven’s *ni* (natural division). To abandon one thing and seize another is to lose this balance.

The principle holds: The heart of a lord must be wise and sagely as its foundation; the Way of governing a state must be pure and tranquil as its basis. Yet if he chases beasts across the wilderness, races chariots over perilous peaks, lets the six dragons of his team bolt unchecked, or leads ten thousand riders in vain pursuit; if he vies with eagles and ospreys for speed or competes with bears and brown bears in bravery; if the sun and moon are obscured and banners entangled in chaos; if he hunts without thought of return, slaughtering without end; if wind and rain constantly afflict him and his palace lies empty—this is called "madness."

Worse still is to covet distant lands and their exotic products, to crave useless territories, to lust after *jujiang* sauce and thus invade the Western Rong, or to attack Dayuan for its famous horses. The passes and frontiers become haunted by unquiet spirits, the border towns by the resentful souls of the bereaved. The realm’s people scatter, households dwindle, and the august ancestral temples nearly fall to enemies. The histories record these events, and for a hundred generations, they serve as warnings.

---

**Chapter Thirteen: Favor and Disgrace**
Favor and disgrace are like alarms.

The principle holds: Though the lord possesses all under Heaven, inherits the legacy of a hundred kings, and reports to the Supreme Mystery while ruling over the myriad things, he must still govern with the caution of one driving a rotten chariot, heed the warnings of the moat’s edge, and embrace anxieties—only then can he enjoy long years and preserve his distant mandate.

For ministers, too, the blessings of nine promotions and three audiences are already generous; the responsibilities of military tallies and ministerial seals are already weighty. Clad in tall caps and grand banners, riding long-hubbed crimson wheels, their might overshadows the likes of Yi and Gao, their power rivals that of the Wei and Huo families—yet they must rise early and retire late, tread as if on thin ice and stand as if over a deep abyss, only then can they preserve their good fortune and avoid the calamity of overturning the sacrificial grain.

Thus, the Prime Minister of Chu was dismissed thrice yet bore no resentment; Kaofu was ennobled thrice and grew only more reverent—both understood this principle.

**Great Calamity as One’s Own Body**
The principle holds: Those who rely on favor to grow arrogant—In the fourth year of Duke Yin of Lu, Gongzi Zhouxu of Wei, favored and fond of warfare, was admonished by his minister Shi Que, who said: "I have heard that to love a son, one must teach him the proper way, steering him from depravity. Arrogance, extravagance, dissipation, and excess all arise from depravity. These four come from excessive favor and emolument. Few indeed are those who, though favored, do not grow arrogant; who, though arrogant, can humble themselves; who, though humbled, bear no resentment; who, though resentful, can restrain their grief."

The duke did not heed him. The following year, Duke Huan ascended the throne, and Zhouxu murdered him. The people of Wei killed Zhouxu—this was disaster born of favor.

**Chapter Fourteen: "Look at It and Do Not See"**

These three cannot be subjected to inquiry, thus they are again blended into one.

*Annotation:* The three—level, rare, and subtle—are but provisional designations for the Dao; in truth, they are all non-being. These three transform into the Three Realms, which in turn become the Three Realms of Existence, below which lie the Three Powers, above which shine the Three Luminaries. Within the body, they are the Three Origins; within the inner self, they are the Three Ones—all formed by the Dao’s division of essence and operation of transformation.

The Three Realms are the primordial qi of the Three Treasures Lords, congealed into the colors azure, yellow, and white, also called the Mysterious Origin, the inception of the Three Qi, the ancestral root of all heavens, and the primordial source of the myriad transformations.

The Three Realms of Existence are: the Desire Realm’s Six Heavens, governing the Nine Immortals; the Form Realm’s Eighteen Heavens, governing the Nine Perfected; and the Formless Realm’s Four Heavens, governing the Nine Sages.

The Three Origins within the human body are: the brain as the Muddy Pellet Palace, governing the Upper Origin; the heart as the Crimson Palace, governing the Middle Origin; and below the navel as the Cinnabar Field, governing the Lower Origin.

The Three Ones are: the Upper Origin’s governance called the Original One; the Middle Origin’s governance called the True One; and the Lower Origin’s governance called the Upright One. The Three Ones’ primordial spirit governs the blending of qi, the consolidation of essence, the preservation of spirit, and the retention of form. In the Supreme Clarity, there is the Revolving Wind’s fusion, the cultivation of the Way of the Three Ones.

It is like fording a river in winter.

*Annotation:* One may question the ancients as such, but people of this age, chasing after realms, become lost. Ten thousand threads rise like steam, a thousand paths swarm like bees. Ambition for fame and sensual pleasures stirs the heart to vie and advance; the pursuit of vast wealth and abundant riches spurs the tracks of greed.

Some indulge in roasting and searing for pleasure; others indulge in slaughter to their heart’s content. They cast themselves into the river of love and desire, drifting with the current never to return; they drown their nature in the surging waves, gone without hope of return. Not only do they suffer the agony of ice and peril—moreover, the retribution is clear and certain. Why is this so?

Those who drown in profit and desire, venturing far in ceaseless pursuit, meet with the retribution of water and land bandits. Those who oppress and humiliate others meet with the retribution of wrath, strife, and the net of punishment. Those who deceive their ruler meet with the retribution of execution and the ruin of their house. Those who tyrannize the people meet with the retribution of banditry and the rise of vengeance. How much worse, then, are the consequences of harming life and destroying oneself, bringing ruin to state and family?

Who can remain at peace for long, moving only to nurture life?

*Annotation:* The gates of cultivation are many, but in broad outline: there is exhaling the stale and inhaling the primordial harmony, swallowing the cloud-fluid and rinsing with the celestial sap; eating pine and cypress, fasting to consume the magic mushroom; or withdrawing from court to ascend the Supreme Clarity, secretly observing the revolving of the Mysterious Dipper. Some refine the Five Metals and Eight Stones, or the flowing pearls of liquid jade; they use the yin cauldron and yang furnace, the Five Flowers and Nine Cycles. Others wield the plain scriptures and cinnabar talismans, summoning spirits and gods; with golden seals and azure threads, they pledge oaths to Heaven and Earth. Thus arise the orthodox methods: the *Zhengyi* and the *Daode* for ascending the Mystery, the *Dongshen* and *Lingbao*, the covenants with the Three Clarities—all these arts flourish together.

For those who ascend the Dao, attain ranks, and achieve transcendence, there are further practices: racing the Two Luminaries, paying homage to the Five Celestial Bodies, grasping the Pole to climb the *Kui*, hastening through the celestial web and flying along the astral cords; swallowing the sun and moon, restraining the *po* and capturing the *hun*; gazing at the clouds through the Eight Paths, receiving the affairs of the Nine Perfected; ascending the Mystery to recline beneath the Dipper, entering the *Fangzhu* and the Cavern Chambers; the *Zuoyou Lingfei*, the *Yinyang Liujia*, the Three Sections and Eight Sceneries, the Twenty-Four Perfected; visualizing and ingesting the Three Origins, focusing intention on the Three Ones; the Purple Chamber and Yellow Palace, the Crimson Scenery and Vermilion Infant; the *Zixu Nan Yue* chapters, the *Qingtong Donghai* formulas; inwardly inspecting the Five Viscera, subduing the Six Heavens below; guiding and pulling, swallowing talismans, riding the wind and nurturing qi—methods of soaring transcendence overflow the true scriptures.

Here ends the first scroll of *The Emperor’s Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*.
Here begins the second scroll of *The Emperor’s Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*.

**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Utmost in Emptiness**

Attain the utmost in emptiness; guard stillness with sincerity.

**Commentary:** "Water flows toward the damp; fire tends toward the dry"—this is the line from the *Yijing*’s *Qian* hexagram, ninth-five, and the meaning of "inducing the army" in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.

**Exegesis:** In the twelfth year of Duke Xuan’s reign in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, King Zhuang of Chu besieged Zheng for seventeen days. The people of Zheng divined for terms of surrender, but the omens were inauspicious, and the state mourned. King Zhuang of Chu withdrew his forces, but after the people of Zheng repaired their walls, he besieged them again for three months and conquered them. The Earl of Zheng, bare-chested and leading a sheep, went forth to meet the King of Chu, who then granted peace. Pan Wang renewed the covenant, and Ziliang was sent as a hostage.

In the sixth month of summer, the Jin army came to relieve Zheng and reached the region between Ao and Hao. King Zhuang of Chu then sought terms with Jin. A date for the covenant was set, but Xu Bo of Chu drove the chariot, with Yue Bo as the warrior and She Shu as the right-hand guard. They sought to provoke a single combat, feigning no desire for peace, to lure the Jin army into battle. Xu Bo said: "I have heard that to ‘induce the army,’ one drives the chariot through the enemy’s banners and ramparts before withdrawing." Yue Bo said: "To command the army, one shoots thorns from the left, relieves the driver to take the reins, dismounts, and turns the horses’ collars before withdrawing." She Shu said: "To ‘induce the army,’ one enters the enemy’s rampart from the right, severs an ear, takes a captive, and then withdraws." Each acted according to what he had heard and retreated, but the Jin forces pursued them. Yue Bo shot a horse with his left hand and a man with his right, and the pursuers could not advance.

At that time, Wei Qi and Zhao Zhan of Jin bore grudges and requested to be envoys to Chu, both hoping for Jin’s defeat. Zhi Zi also failed to prepare, and at the Battle of Bi, the Jin army was routed. Thus, by "inducing the army," one ensures the enemy will be drawn forth. We observe their retreat in this way.

The *Subcommentary* states: The *Book of Changes* says, "Thunder lies within the earth—*Fu* (Return)."
The *Exegesis* explains: The *Fu* hexagram of the *Book of Changes* depicts this image: "Thunder lies within the earth—*Fu*." Thunder is a moving entity, and the *Fu* hexagram takes the cessation of movement as its essence. Thus it says, "Thunder lies within the earth." The Former Kings, on the solstice, would close the passes, halt commerce, and cease their tours of inspection—all to embody the principle of motion’s cessation and the return to the root.

"Those who do not know the constant."
The *Annotation* notes: This refers to the line statement of the ninth line of the third place in the *Heng* (Constancy) hexagram of the *Book of Changes*: "They do not maintain their virtue constantly."

**Chapter Seventeen: "The Highest"**
"Those who revere them, those who scorn them."
The *Subcommentary* states: The Three Kings and the Five Hegemons.
The *Exegesis* explains: The Three Kings were the rulers of Xia, Yin, and Zhou. The Five Hegemons included Kunwu of Xia, a descendant of the Yellow Emperor; the hegemons of Yin were Dapeng and Shivei, descendants of Yao; and the hegemons of Zhou were Duke Huan of Qi, the younger son of Duke Xi, named Xiaobai, who reigned during the eras of King Hui and King Xiang of Zhou; and Duke Wen of Jin, the son of Duke Xian, named Chong’er, who ascended in the twenty-second year of Duke Xi and fled the disaster of Lady Li in the fourth year of Duke Xi.

"Where trust is insufficient, there is distrust."
The *Exegesis* explains: In the eleventh year of Duke Xuan’s reign in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the Viscount of Chu attacked Zheng and reached Li. Ziliang, a minister of Zheng, said: "Neither Chu nor Jin cultivates virtue. Whichever comes, we may follow. Neither Jin nor Chu keeps faith—how can we alone be trustworthy?" Thus they followed Chu. That summer, they allied with the Viscount of Chu at Chenling, and Chen and Zheng submitted. This is an instance of "where trust is insufficient, there is distrust."

**Chapter Eighteen: "When the Great Dao Is Abandoned"**

**Commentary:** "Counting grains while cooking, combing hairs one by one."
**Exegesis:** The *Huainanzi* states: "Counting grains and combing hairs—such fussiness brings no clarity. Overdoing action is no different from scratching one’s back with one’s knee or untying a knot with one’s heel."

"When the six relations are not in harmony, there are filial piety and compassion."
**Commentary:** As in the case of fanning the pillow and warming the mat.
**Exegesis:** In the Song dynasty, there was a man named Zhi Bao, styled Xiaochang. Orphaned at three, he wept whenever he saw his uncles Quan and others, who were all eminent. His mother, Lady Chen, suspected he feared them and scolded him. Bao replied: "I grieve only that I never knew my father. Seeing my uncles’ resemblance to him brings sorrow." He sighed deeply, and his mother wept in shared grief. Thereafter, he served her: in summer, he fanned her pillow; in winter, he warmed her mat.

"When the state is benighted and in chaos, there are loyal ministers."
**Exegesis:** Upright counsel is loyalty; flattery is sycophancy. Ignorance of principle is benightedness; disorder between ruler and ruled is chaos.
**Commentary:** Such a flourishing age abounds with worthy officers—all are Kui and Long, whose constant norms bring order.
**Exegesis:** As the *Book of Songs* says: "Abundant are the many officers; by them King Wen found peace." The "many officers" are the host of ministers—Kui and Long, the aides of Shun. The *Book of Documents* states: "Kui composed the standard music: the eight instruments achieved harmony. When stone chimes were struck, the hundred beasts danced in step. The *Xiaoshao* reached its ninth movement, and the phoenix came to pay homage. Long served as the receiver of words, conveying the royal commands, and the constant norms were thereby ordered." This speaks of Shun, who, having worthy ministers to uphold the laws, never erred in governance.

**Chapter Nineteen: "Abandon Sagacity, Discard Knowledge"**
Abandon craftiness, discard profit.

**Commentary:** Discussed in the eighth chapter of the *Liezi*.
**Exegesis:** Such as the man of Wei who carved a monkey from a jujube pit, or the man of Song who carved a mulberry leaf—these should be abandoned.

**Chapter Twenty: "Abandon Learning, Be Without Care"**
Vast indeed, it has no end!

**Commentary:** As the *Book of Songs* says: "The night is not yet spent."

**Exegesis:** This is from the *"Torches in the Courtyard"* in the *Xiaoya* section of the *Book of Songs*.

"Jubilant are the multitudes,
As if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
As if ascending the springtime terrace."

**Exegesis:** Six seals hang at their waists, five offices vie for their favor. A single frown makes the feudal lords tremble; at ease, they bring peace to the realm. Luxuriance and splendor fill their ambitions; wealth and nobility delight their fleeting years. Five tripods array their tables, sated with the rich flavors of the grandest sacrifice. A profusion of fragrances pleases their senses; the springtime terrace offers boundless vistas. There are Yan beauties and Luoyang charms, Chu dances and Wu songs. The eight tones deafen their ears; the five colors dazzle their eyes. Joyous indeed—yet what end does it bring?

As the *Rites of the Vessels* states: "To sacrifice with the grandest offering need not be excessive; it accords with the measure of one’s nature." It further says: "The feudal lords use seven offerings, great officers five." Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records Wu’s demand of a hundred offerings from Lu. The ox, sheep, and pig—collectively called *lao*—serve as sacrificial animals. The ox is the foremost of these: the Son of Heaven uses a pure-colored ox, while the feudal lords use a fattened sheep, and the great officers a tethered ox, accepting whatever is available without preference. The ox is called *yuan*; when the great warrior is to perform sacrifice, it must be penned. Fed for three months, it is raised according to strict standards to prepare for the unpredictable. As in the *Zuozhuan*, when a shrew gnawed the horn of the ox for the suburban sacrifice, they changed the divination and chose another beast.

The sheep is used by the Son of Heaven for consecrating the ancestral temple, opening the icehouse, and announcing the new moon—called *soft-fleeced*. In early spring, it is eaten with wheat. The pig is used in all the Son of Heaven’s sacrifices to complete the three offerings. Thus, the ox is called the *great offering*, the sheep the *middle offering*, and the pig the *lesser offering*—also known as *bristled*. By ritual, the Son of Heaven does not kill an ox without cause, nor does a great officer kill a dog or pig without cause, for these are all used in sacrifices. To kill them outside of ritual is called "without cause." The term *lao* refers to the sturdy enclosure where sacrificial animals are raised; hence, they are collectively called *lao*.

**Commentary:** "In the lingering spring days, they gather the white southernwood in abundance."

**Exegesis:** *Gathering white southernwood* refers to the time of silkworm-rearing, when the *fan* and *po* herbs flourish. *Abundantly* means in great numbers.

"Like an infant who has not yet learned to smile."

**Commentary:** Not yet reaching the stage of smiling and recognizing others.

**Exegesis:** This is from the fourteenth chapter, *"Heaven’s Revolutions,"* of the *Zhuangzi*. The *Family Sayings of Confucius*, in the *"Destiny of Life"* chapter, states: "At three months, a child begins to blink; then its eyes can see. At eight months, its teeth appear; then it can eat. At a year, its kneecaps form; then it can walk. By three years, its fontanelle closes; then it can speak."

**Chapter Twenty-Two: "Bend to Preserve"**
To bend is to be made straight.

**Commentary:** As the *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: "To correct the crooked is called straight."

**Exegesis:** This refers to Lian Po and Lin Xiangru.

**Exegesis:** In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the seventh year of Duke Xiang, winter, tenth month: Han Xianzi of Jin announced his retirement. His son, Muzi Wuji, who suffered from a debilitating illness, was to be appointed in his stead. Wuji declined, saying: "The *Book of Songs* says: *'Is it not from dawn to dusk? Yet the path is heavy with dew.'* It also says: *'Without personal effort, the common people will not trust.'* I am unworthy—should I not yield? I beg to recommend Qi instead."

To wander with Tian Su and call it "love of benevolence."
The *Book of Songs* says:
*"Be reverent in your station,
Love this uprightness—
The spirits hear it,
And grant you great fortune."*
To care for the people is virtue;
Uprightness is rectitude;
To rectify one’s own heart is true governance.
To correct the crooked is to make straight;
To correct others’ crookedness is to guide them.
Three harmonies make seven:
Virtue, rectitude, and uprightness—
When these three are complete in a person,
Then the bright spirits hear it,
Great fortune descends upon them,
And their establishment is assured.

On the day *gengxu*, Han Qi was sent to pay respects to Xianzi,
Who then requested to retire.
The Lord of Jin, deeming Han Wuji benevolent,
Appointed him as Grand Master of the Royal Clan.

To embrace the One is to be a model for all under Heaven.

**Exegesis:** When one state has three lords,
Governance becomes naturally difficult.
With ten sheep and nine shepherds,
How can unity be achieved?
Those who lose their sheep do so because of many forks in the road;
Those who lose their lives do so because of many affairs.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: "Few Words Align with the Natural"**
Those who align with the Dao,
Even in loss, gain it.

**Exegesis:** Thus, when the *gong* note is plucked, the *gong* responds;
When the *jiao* note is plucked, the *jiao* answers—
This is resonance of sound.
The withered mulberry stirs, and the sky’s wind rises;
The scorching rain falls, and the plinth grows damp—
This is resonance of *qi*.
The dragon’s roar summons clouds;
The tiger’s roar summons wind—
The sentient moves the insentient.
The bronze mountain collapses, and the bell responds—
This is resonance of kind.
The reed-ash splits, and the lunar halo wanes—
This is resonance of circumstance.
The crane’s cry calls forth its mate—
This is resonance of nature.
Heaped goodness brings surplus blessings;
Heaped evil brings surplus misfortune—
This is resonance of conduct.
Those who share a boat and cross together,
Though Hu and Yue may differ in heart,
Do not fear discord—
This is resonance of circumstance.
Moisture flows toward the dry—
The insentient moves the insentient.
The noble, though a thousand *li* apart, share the same wind;
The petty, though separated by a mere path, differ in custom.

**Exegesis:** As for the *fangzhu* and the *yang sui*—

**Exegesis:** Between the *Fangzhu* of the Eastern Sea,
There is a giant clam,
Twelve inches in length,
Hence called *fangzhu*.
Its shell, when polished with soft silk for a long time,
Then exposed to moonlight,
Will yield water when a vessel is placed beneath it.
The *yang sui* is a fire-mirror,
Used to kindle flame.
In ancient sacrificial rites, purity was prized:
The *fangzhu* drew water,
The *yang sui* provided fire.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: "Those Who Stand on Tiptoe Do Not Stand Firm"**
Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit.

**Exegesis:** In the *Annals of Spring and Autumn*, the twenty-ninth year of Duke Xiang’s reign, the state of Qi banished its minister Gao Zhi to the northern state of Yan. The *Commentary* states: Gao Zhi delighted in claiming merit for his deeds and acting with self-serving authority—thus he met with disaster.

In the second year of Duke Ai’s reign, Zhao Jianzi fought the state of Zheng. Struck by Zheng’s forces, he was beaten within his chariot and lost his *feng* banner. Gongsun Long led five hundred followers to his aid, launching a night attack on the Zheng army and reclaiming the *feng* banner. The Zheng forces suffered a crushing defeat.

After the battle, Jianzi declared: “I crouched low in the chariot, my blood flowing freely, yet the drumbeat never faltered—today, I was supreme among the commanders.”

The Crown Prince of Wei, Ju Shu, serving as his right-hand warrior, said: “I rescued my lord from the chariot and drove back the enemy from below—thus, I was supreme among the right-hand warriors.”

The charioteer, Xie Liang, said: “I kept the reins taut and steady, guiding the chariot through the fray. When the battle lines threatened to break, I held them firm—thus, I was supreme among the charioteers.”

This illustrates that Jianzi failed to yield credit, so his subordinates all boasted of their own merits, and thus they could not achieve harmony.

**Excess is like leftover food or a superfluous limb.**

**Exegesis:** The *Annals of Spring and Autumn* states: “Others will refuse to consume what remains of my food.”

**Exegesis:** In the sixth year of Duke Zhuang’s reign, King Wen of Chu attacked the state of Shen, passing through Deng. Marquis Qi of Deng said, “He is my nephew,” and detained him to feast him. The marquis’s three nephews—Diao Sheng, Dan Sheng, and Yang Sheng—urged him to kill the king of Chu. The marquis refused.

The three nephews said: “The one who will destroy Deng is surely this man. If we do not act now, it will be like biting our own navels—will we then have the chance to act? The time to act is now!”

The marquis replied: “Others will refuse to consume what remains of my food.” He meant that to harm his own nephew would invite contempt from others.

They countered: “If you do not heed your three ministers’ counsel, the altars of the state will be drenched in blood, and how then will you have any leftovers to offer?”

He did not listen. After attacking Shen, Chu turned back and attacked Deng. In the sixteenth year, Chu again attacked Deng and annihilated it—this was the sixteenth year of Duke Zhuang’s reign.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: "There Is a Thing, Formlessly Formed"**
I know not its name.

The Exposition states: Generally, for all things, the name precedes the courtesy name. According to ritual, when a boy is born, on the third day, a mulberry bow and six arrows of artemisia are used to shoot toward heaven, earth, and the four directions, signifying that a man has duties across the four quarters. After three months, the wife presents the child to her husband. Entering the gate, she ascends by the eastern steps; the wife, holding the child, emerges from the ascending steps. The father takes the child’s right hand, fondles him, and bestows a name, stroking his head. At twenty, he undergoes the capping ceremony and is called a grown man. The capping is performed at the eastern steps, signifying succession. A libation is offered at the guest’s position, marking the attainment of manhood. The cap is placed three times: first with black cloth, then with a leather cap, and finally with a ceremonial cap, each step elevating his dignity. After capping, he is given a courtesy name, honoring his name.

For girls, at fifteen, they undergo the hairpinning ceremony and are given a courtesy name. Thus, the capping ritual is the beginning of rites, the weightiest of auspicious affairs. This sequence—name first, then courtesy name—reflects growth from small to great, the Way of human relations, which begins and then reaches completion. Hence, one grows from small to great, and from great returns to the end.

In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, in the sixth year of Duke Huan, in the ninth month on the day *dingmao*, a son was born. The Duke inquired of Shen Xu about the name. Shen Xu replied: “There are five principles for naming: trust, righteousness, resemblance, borrowing, and likeness. Naming after birth is trust, as with Tang Shu Yu and Duke You of Lu. Naming after virtue is righteousness, as with King Wen (Chang) and King Wu (Fa). Naming after resemblance is symbolism, as with Confucius, who resembled Mount Niqiu. Borrowing from things is borrowing, as when Boyu was born and someone presented a fish, so he was named Li (‘Carp’). Naming after the father is likeness, as when Zitong was born on the same day as his father.

One does not use the state’s name, for that would abolish the name. One does not use official titles, for that would abolish office. One does not use mountains or rivers, for that would abolish the lord. One does not use sacrificial animals, for that would abolish the altars. One does not use ritual vessels or silk, for that would abolish ritual. One does not use the hidden, for the name will eventually be tabooed. Thus, Jin abolished the Minister of Instruction because of Duke Xi, Song abolished the Minister of Works because of martial merit, and the former lord Xianwu abolished the two mountains, Jushan and Aoshan. Therefore, great things cannot be used for naming.”

The Duke said: “Since he was born on the same day as I, name him Tong (‘Same’).”

Regarding clans and lineages: In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, in the eighth year of Duke Yin, in winter, Gongzi Wu Hai died. Gongzi Yufu requested a posthumous title and a clan name. The Duke inquired of Zhong Zhong about clans. Zhong Zhong replied: “The Son of Heaven establishes virtue, grants surnames based on birth, bestows land, and commands clans. The feudal lords use the courtesy name of their royal grandfather, or their posthumous title, and adopt it as their clan. If an official has hereditary merit, there is an official clan, meaning they take their former office or former fief as their clan; the same applies to fiefs.” The Duke commanded that Wu Hai be styled Zhan, thus becoming the clan of Zhan—he was the grandson of Gongzi Zhan.

The Dao of Heaven first gives the courtesy name and then the name, for the Dao has no beginning and no end.

The *Great* is called *passing away*. The *Subcommentary* states: “The *Zhuangzi* says: ‘The Dao, in its greatness, does not end’ (*Heavenly Revolutions*, chapter fourteen).” And the king occupies one aspect of it.

The Exposition states: If the king embodies the Dao, then the sun and moon align like joined jades, the five planets form a string of pearls, sweet dew descends, sweet springs flow, the Yellow River does not overflow, the sea does not churn waves, auspicious stars appear, propitious clouds arise, divine dragons swim in his ponds, unicorns and phoenixes come to his court. The four seasons harmonize into a *jade candle*, all things fulfill their nature, and great peace prevails.

If the ruler lacks the Dao, then heaven reverses the seasons to bring disasters, earth reverses things to produce omens, people reverse virtue to cause chaos. Pernicious qi and baleful portents appear above, monstrous forms and strange phenomena suddenly manifest below. Stars vanish, the sun contends, winter thunders, summer frosts, the sky splits, rocks bear fruit, rivers dry, mountains collapse. Affairs arise among people, and qi moves heaven—thus do heaven and earth suffer harm.

Humans emulate earth to reach utmost naturalness. The *Subcommentary*: “To block the source and uproot the foundation.”

The *Exposition* states: In the ninth year of Duke Zhao of *Lu*’s reign, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the Jin generals Liang Bing and Zhang Ti led the Yin Rong tribes to attack Ying, provoked by the dispute between the Zhou official Gan Ren and Jin’s Yan Jia over the Yan fields. King Jing of Zhou dispatched the grandee Zhan Huanbo to remonstrate with Jin, saying: “Since the Xia dynasty and Hou Ji, Wei, Chi, Rui, Qi, and Bi have been our western lands; Ba, Pu, Chu, and Deng, our southern lands. When King Wu conquered Shang, Pugu and Shangyan became our eastern lands, while Sushen, Yan, and Bo became our northern lands. What near borders do we possess? Kings Wen and Wu, Cheng and Kang enfeoffed their younger brothers to serve as the Zhou’s bulwarks. Even when these enfeoffments fell into decay, were they not still like caps and tassels, used to shield and adorn? The former kings stationed the *Daowu* among the four frontier tribes to ward off demons and goblins. Thus, the treacherous among the Yun clan were exiled to Guazhou. Yet when your late father, Duke Hui, returned from Qin, he lured them here, allowing them to press upon our Ji clans, enter our suburban districts—whence did the Rong seize them? If the Rong now hold the Central States, whose fault is this? Hou Ji once planted and nurtured all under heaven; now the Rong control it—is this not grievous? Uncle, if you encircle them, I stand with you as robes stand with their crowns and tassels, as water and trees stand with their roots and sources, as the people stand with their counselors. If you rend your crown, destroy your tassels, uproot the source, block the origin, and cast aside your counselors, then even among the Rong and Di, how could a single man remain?”

Shu Xiang said to Xuanzi: “When King Wen was hegemon, could he alter the natural order? He supported and honored the Son of Heaven with reverence. Since King Wen’s time, each generation has seen virtue decline, while violence and contempt for the royal Zhou have been flaunted to display their arrogance. Is it not fitting that the feudal lords should waver in loyalty?” Moreover, the king’s words are just—consider them carefully.” Xuanzi was pleased. As the king had a mourning in his affinal kin, he sent Zhao Cheng to Zhou to offer condolences and present the Yan fields along with funeral gifts. The captives from Ying were repatriated. The king also dispatched Bin Hua to seize Gan official Xiang and present him to Jin in apology. The Jin rulers treated him with courtesy and sent him home.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Weight as the Root of Lightness**
Weight is the root of lightness.
*Subcommentary*: “Those who seek by moving their jaws.”
*Exposition*: This refers to the *Yijing*’s *Yi* hexagram, first *yao* of the lower trigram. It speaks of how people open their mouths to speak and chew their food, both requiring movement of the jaws. The noble person, observing this *yi* (jaw) image, thus guards his words and moderates his diet.
“Though there be splendid vistas.”
*Subcommentary*: “Lofty towers and deep pools.”

**Exposition**: This refers to the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, twenty-sixth year of Duke Zhao’s reign, winter, tenth month. Duke Jing of Qi fell gravely ill, afflicted with a lingering malady that persisted beyond the expected time of recovery. Many envoys from the feudal lords arrived to inquire after his health. Liang Qiu Ju and Yi Kuan, two high ministers, addressed the duke: “We have served the spirits and gods with abundant offerings, surpassing even those made to our former lords. Yet now that Your Lordship is stricken with illness, causing the feudal lords distress, this must be the fault of the invocators and scribes. The feudal lords, unaware of the truth, will deem us irreverent. Why not execute the invocator Gu and the scribe Qi to appease our guests?” The duke was pleased and relayed this to Yanzi.

Yanzi replied: “At the former covenant of Song, Qu Jian asked Zhao Wu about the virtue of Fan Hui. Zhao Wu said: ‘That gentleman’s household affairs were well-ordered. In his words to the state of Jin, he exhausted his sincerity without partiality. His invocators and scribes, when making sacrificial offerings, presented truth without shame. His household affairs were free of suspicion, and his invocators and scribes did not pray for personal gain.’ Qu Jian repeated this to King Kang, who declared: ‘Neither spirits nor men bear him resentment. It is fitting that this gentleman has been the guiding light to five rulers, serving as the leader among the feudal lords.’” (The five rulers were Dukes Wen, Xiang, Ling, Cheng, and Jing.)

The duke said: “Ju and Kuan claim that We are capable of serving the spirits and gods, hence their desire to execute the invocators and scribes. Yet you cite these words—why?”

Yanzi replied: “If a ruler possesses virtue, his inner and outer domains remain unneglected, his superiors and subordinates bear no resentment, and his actions never transgress propriety. His invocators and scribes present truth without shame in their hearts. Thus, the spirits and gods accept his offerings, and the state receives their blessings. The invocators and scribes share in this, and their prosperity, longevity, and old age are due to the trustworthy rule of their lord, whose words are loyal and sincere before the spirits and gods.

But if a ruler is dissolute, his inner and outer domains fall into disorder, his superiors and subordinates seethe with grievance, and his actions are perverse and transgressive. He indulges his desires, sates his private cravings, builds lofty towers and deep pools, strikes bells and dances with women, exhausts the people’s strength, and plunders their stores to fuel his transgressions, heedless of posterity. Cruel and oppressive, wanton and unrestrained, he acts without measure, shirks no taboo, disregards slander, and fears neither spirits nor gods. The spirits rage, the people suffer, and his heart knows no repentance. If his invocators and scribes present truth, their words become accusations. If they conceal his faults and fabricate virtues, their words are deceitful flattery. With no honest recourse, they resort to empty praise to curry favor. Thus, the spirits and gods do not accept his state’s offerings but instead visit calamity upon it, and the invocators and scribes share in this. Their early deaths, blindness, orphanhood, and illness are due to the tyranny of their lord, whose words are false and insolent before the spirits and gods.”

The duke asked: “Then what should be done?”

Yanzi replied: “It cannot be achieved thus. The trees of the mountain forests are guarded by the *henglu* officials; the reeds and rushes of the marshes by the *zhoujiao* officials; the firewood of the thickets by the *yuhou* officials; the salt and clams of the sea by the *qiwang* officials. Yet the people of the borderlands are subjected to their governance; the frontier passes extort their private goods; hereditary ministers forcibly seize their wealth. The markets have no fixed standards, and levies are without measure. Palaces are renovated daily, and wanton pleasures never cease. The favored concubines within the palace plunder the markets; the favored ministers outside issue arbitrary commands in the borderlands. Private desires and demands for sustenance, if unmet, provoke retaliation. The people suffer and sicken, and husbands and wives alike curse their ruler. If curses had power, then even the most skilled invocators could not counter the imprecations of a hundred million people. If Your Lordship wishes to punish the invocators and scribes, first cultivate virtue.”

The duke was pleased and ordered his officials to relax policies, dismantle barriers, abolish prohibitions, and reduce taxes and debts. In the twelfth month, Duke Jing hunted at Pei. This illustrates the benefit of Yanzi’s counsel, for the duke, having cultivated virtue, swiftly recovered from his illness and was soon able to hunt.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Good as the Teacher of the Not-Good**
The good are the teachers of the not-good.

“In the rites of the Great Learning, though the Son of Heaven issues commands, he does not face north—this is to honor the teacher. The adept learner finds the teacher at ease while his achievement doubles; the inept learner finds the teacher wearied while his achievement halves, and then turns to resent him. As the way of the former kings in serving the teacher admits no north-facing: when the king moves west, he turns and faces south, standing to the east. The Grand Tutor faces west, instructing the king in the purport of the Daoist scriptures. Thus, in the king’s sense of right, ruler, father, and teacher are one. Though the teacher holds no rank within the five degrees of mourning, none among those five degrees may fail to treat him as kin—such is the way of the teacher. Even the wise may yet fall into profound delusion.

It is said: For those who first cultivate the Way, there are ten matters they cannot afford to ignore.
First, the beginner, moved by good desire, must harbor a heart that delights in progress.
Second, he must draw near to good companions who guide his heart and deepen his faith in the true Dao.
Third, he must seek out an enlightened teacher, one who possesses wondrous methods, can broadly expound them, and reveal essential techniques.
Fourth, having heard the true teaching, he must be able to receive, study, and recite it.
Fifth, he must leave the household life, devote himself to gentle and yielding conduct, forever sever all conditioned action, and break free from every fetter.
Sixth, he must receive the true precepts to guard body, speech, and mind.
Seventh, he must dwell in secluded mountains and forests, abide in reclusion, forever depart from the clamor of the dusty world, and cultivate a mind of stillness.
Eighth, he must contemplate the Great Dao as the true Dharma-king, able to ferry sentient beings across the sea of birth and death, just as a ship’s pilot rescues the drowning.
Ninth, he must contemplate the scriptural teachings as wondrous medical prescriptions, able to prescribe the medicine of affliction for sentient beings.
Tenth, he must contemplate the true Dharma as his true parents, for it alone can beget his Dharma-body and wisdom-life.

These ten principles form the foundation of the initial stage. Thereafter, one proceeds through the gentle-subduing methods of the Lesser Vehicle, advances to the concurrent cultivation of the Middle Vehicle, and finally enters the contemplative practices of the Great Vehicle.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: When About to Act***
When about to take the world and act upon it...”

The Meaning states: The lords of the world under Heaven are born with extraordinary omens. Treading upon giant footprints, Fuxi was conceived; enveloped by a divine dragon, the Flame Emperor was carried in the womb. The Yellow Emperor was born as lightning coiled around the Dipper; Shaohao emerged as stars trailed in rainbow hues. Zhuanxu and Gaoxin were endowed with profound sagacity from birth; Yao of Tang and Shun of Yu bore celestial marks of wonder. Yao’s fire mandate was revealed through the red dragon, Shun’s earthly virtue through the rainbow’s auspice. The moon’s essence summoned Yu; a swallow’s egg descended upon Tang. Purple qi shrouded Mount Dang; crimson radiance illuminated the Han house—all these sovereigns bore extraordinary omens upon their persons.

Through the accumulation of mysterious merit, the Yellow Emperor received the Mandate; inheriting prior achievements, Zhuanxu was granted the tally. The Yellow Emperor’s line endured seventeen generations before the Shang inherited the throne; Hou Ji’s descendants prospered through thirteen generations before the rise of the Western Earl. All these exemplify the accumulation of merit across ages.

Yet those who cling lose it.

The Meaning states: When a ruler succeeds to the throne and inherits the celestial charge, if his virtue fails to nourish the realm, calamity arises within the land. Edicts go unheeded, weapons turn inward, the world falls into chaos, and the seas boil in turmoil. A true sovereign, responding to the turning of fate, emerges to save the people, restoring order from disorder—such were the founders of dynasties: Yu of Xia, Tang of Yin, Wu of Zhou, and the Han Ancestor. Once the realm is pacified, the throne is passed to their descendants. Thus, succeeding rulers inherit the mandate, preserving the legacy and upholding the ancestral statutes—such were Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, King Nan of Zhou, and Emperor Xian of Han, the inheritors of established rule.

Yet the founders of dynasties must possess sagely virtue: blocking transgressions, aiding in errors, manifesting virtue, and displaying benevolence. They draw in the hidden and forsaken, seeking out the people’s afflictions and ailments. At the dawn of their reign, they rarely meet with ruin, for they exert themselves to govern with diligence. The inheritors, however, know not the toil of plowing and sowing. Raised in the hands of women, born within the depths of the palace, their hearts are confounded by the eight tones and five colors, their natures drowned in lavish attire and wanton music. Some exhaust their armies at the four frontiers, spreading poison across the nine provinces. They regard their subjects as enemies, seeing the people as mere grass and weeds. Their actions invite wholesale slaughter, forsaking the laws and canons. Defying the Dao and violating Heaven, they oppress the divine lords and the people. Thus, weapons rise on all sides, floods and droughts arrive untimely, the gods grow wrathful, the multitudes scatter, ghosts wail, and the people groan in resentment. Thereupon, exile to Nanchao, execution at Muye, death amidst the black-haired masses, or loss of power to treacherous heroes—once the grand enterprise is forfeited, the great enterprise returns no more. This illustrates how those who cling lose it, serving as a warning to later kings.

To "illuminate virtue and block transgressions": In the second year of Duke Huan of Lu, recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Hua Du of Song murdered Kong Jiafu and assassinated Duke Shang, enthroning Prince Ping as Duke Zhuang. He bribed Duke Huan of Lu with the Gao tripod, which the duke placed in his ancestral temple. The grandee Zang Aibo admonished: "One who rules over men must illuminate virtue and block transgressions to oversee the hundred officials, yet still fears failure. Now, by placing this bribe vessel in the grand temple, you openly display it to the hundred officials. If the officials emulate this, what punishment will you mete out? When King Wu conquered Shang, he moved the nine tripods to Luoyi, and righteous men still criticized him. How much more so, then, for openly displaying a bribe vessel that violates ritual in the grand temple—what will become of it?"

*Mo* means "ailment." *Li* means "ominous qi." That which arises within is called *sheng*; that which arises without is called *zai*. Heavenly fire is also called *zai*.

**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Ruler with the Dao**

**On Righteousness:**

It is said: When Yu wished to attack the Youmiao tribe, after three decades of campaigning, he had yet to subdue them, and the Miao people defied his commands. Yi advised Yu, saying: "Only virtue moves Heaven, and nothing is too distant for its reach. Sincerity moves the spirits—how much more so the Miao?" Yu then withdrew his troops, arrayed his forces, and widely spread civil virtue. He danced with shields and feathered banners upon the two stairways, and after seventy days, the Miao submitted.

Their state lay within the category of the most distant vassals. The rites state: "Dance is used to adorn joy. Grasping shields and axes, practicing bows and stretches, the demeanor becomes solemn. Following the formations and rhythms, the ranks become orderly." Shields, axes, feathered banners, and flutes are the instruments of dance. Bowing, stretching, lowering, and raising are the postures of dance. The formations, swift or slow, are the ranks of dance. The Son of Heaven used eight rows, the feudal lords six, high officials four, and scholars two. Thus, the virtuous achieve results and nothing more.

*Commentary:* "Results" mean defeating the enemy.

It is said: In the second year of Duke Xuan of *Lu* (as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*), Gongzi Guisheng of Zheng, acting on the orders of the Viscount of Chu, attacked Song. Hua Yuan of Song commanded the defense, and they fought at Da Ji. The Song army was routed. Hua Yuan was captured, and Commander Le Ju was taken, along with 460 chariots, 250 prisoners, and 100 severed ears. A Song minister, Kuang Jiao, went to intercept the Zheng forces. The Zheng soldiers entered a well, then emerged with their halberds reversed, capturing Kuang Jiao. The noble man said: "To violate ritual and defy commands is to invite capture. The martial must be resolute and steadfast in heeding them." To defeat the enemy is "resolute"; to achieve resoluteness is "steadfast." To treat this lightly is to invite execution. Those who act lightly and then reverse course will surely be put to death.

**Chapter Thirty-One: On Fine Weaponry**

Fine weaponry is an instrument of ill omen.

*On Righteousness:* The *Six Strategies* comprise the Dragon, Tiger, Civil, Martial, Leopard, and Hound. The Civil strategy governs the state and establishes order without transgressing Heaven’s constant ways. The Martial strategy subdues calamity and rebellion, overawing the eight directions. The Dragon strategy harmonizes yin and yang without exceeding the seasons. The Tiger strategy wields claws and fangs, crushing all evildoers. The Leopard strategy responds to crises with timely wisdom, seizing the moment. The Hound strategy listens keenly to the faintest signs, sometimes effecting extraordinary change. The *Three Strategies* are also techniques of tactical ingenuity in warfare.

Zhang Liang of Han met the Yellow Stone Elder at Yi Bridge, who presented him with this text. The *Six Strategies* were obtained by Jiang Ziya while fishing at Pan Stream, found in the belly of a great fish. To conceal an instrument upon oneself, the *Book of Changes* (lower *Appended Statements*) says: "The lord shoots a falcon upon the high wall and captures it—nothing is not favorable." Confucius said: "The falcon is a bird; the bow and arrow are instruments; the shooter is a man. The noble man conceals instruments upon himself and waits for the right moment to act—what is there that is not favorable? When the falcon is on a high wall, it is difficult to shoot; when a man occupies a high position, he is difficult to remove. If one in high position is as rapacious as a falcon, those who would remove him must seize the right moment—nothing will not be overcome." The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: "When the noble man obtains the right moment, he mounts his chariot; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed."

Some things are detested by all things, and thus the man of the Dao does not dwell in them.

*Annotation:* Cultivate refinement and establish sincerity.

*On Righteousness:* This refers to the line in the *Book of Changes* (Qian hexagram, nine in the third place) concerning civil instruction and sincerity, meaning honesty.

When there is no alternative, one employs them.

*Commentary:* To weave the warp and woof of Heaven and Earth, Heaven generates the five materials.

*On Righteousness:* North and south form the warp; east and west form the weft. The five materials are the five phases. Violence against others is called "calamity"; defying virtue and indulging in rebellion is called "chaos"; success in capture is called "subduing."

In all cases of royal armies: campaigns with bells and drums are called "punitive expeditions"; those without are called "invasions." Expeditions with just cause are "rightful"; those without are "rebellious." Auspicious affairs honor the left; inauspicious affairs honor the right.

*Commentary:* The *Ritual Records: Tan Gong* states: The Master...

*On Righteousness:* When the Master had a mourning for his younger sister, he clasped his hands and honored the right. His disciples, not knowing the reason, imitated him. The Master said this showed their eagerness to learn. When they realized it was not an auspicious affair, they reverted to honoring the left. *Tan Gong* is the fourth chapter of the *Book of Rites*.

When many are killed...

*Commentary:* The people are the foundation of the state.

*On Righteousness:* This is from the "Five Sons' Song" in the *Book of Documents*.

When victorious in battle, one observes mourning rites.

*Commentary:* The Earl of Qin faced his army and wept.

*On Righteousness:* In the thirty-second year of Duke Xi (as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*), the Earl of Qin attacked Zheng. Qi Zi, a Qin minister, was garrisoning Zheng and sent word to Qin: "The people of Zheng have put me in charge of the keys to their northern gate. If you send a stealthy force, the state can be taken." The Earl of Qin consulted his minister Jian Shu, who said: "To exhaust the army in a distant raid is something I have never heard of. The troops will be weary and their strength spent, while the distant ruler will be prepared—surely this cannot succeed. Whatever the army does, Zheng will know of it. To march a thousand *li*—who would not know?" The Earl of Qin rejected his advice. He summoned Meng Ming, Xi Qi, and Bai Yi and sent them to lead the army out the eastern gate. Jian Shu wept and said: "Meng Ming, I see the army depart but will not see it return." The Earl of Qin sent someone to rebuke him: "What do you know? If you had died at the proper age, the trees on your grave would now be as thick as a man’s embrace." Jian Shu’s son was among the troops. He wept as he saw them off, saying: "The Jin will intercept the army at Xiao. There are two ridges at Xiao: the southern ridge is the tomb of Xia Hou Gao, and the northern ridge is where King Wen took shelter from wind and rain. You will surely die between them, and I will gather your bones there." The Qin army then marched east, passing the northern gate of Zhou. The soldiers removed their helmets and dismounted on both sides, and three hundred chariots leapt forward. Wangsun Man, still young, observed them and said to King Xiang: "The Qin army is arrogant and discourteous—they will surely be defeated."

Light in counsel and lacking in strategy, discourteous and thus careless—entering perilous terrain with such carelessness and no foresight, how could they not be defeated?

When they reached Hua, Zheng’s merchant Xian Gao was on his way to trade in Zhou. Encountering the Qin army, he presented four hides of fine leather and twelve oxen to offer as provisions, then swiftly sent word to Zheng. Duke Mu of Zheng dispatched men to inspect the guest quarters, where they found the enemy already packed, weapons sharpened, and horses fed. He sent Huang Wuzi to deliver this message: "Your lordship has lingered long in our humble state, and we have exhausted our stores of dried meat, provisions, and livestock. As you prepare to depart, our state has its Yuanpu just as Qin has its Juyou—why not take our elk and deer to ease your journey? What say you?"

Qizi fled to Qi, while Feng Sun and Yang Sun escaped to Song. Mengming said, "Zheng is prepared—we cannot hope for victory. If we attack and fail, or besiege and cannot sustain it, we must return." Thus, they destroyed Hua and withdrew.

Yuan Zhen of Jin said, "Qin defied Jian Shu and exhausted its people through greed—Heaven has delivered them to us. Such an opportunity must not be lost, nor the enemy spared. To let them go would breed future calamity, defying Heaven’s will—we must strike the Qin army." Yue Zhi objected, "We have not repaid Qin’s past kindness, yet we would attack their forces—would this not dishonor our late lord?" Xian Zhen replied, "Qin showed no mourning for our mourning, and attacked our kin—where is their courtesy? What kindness is there to repay? I have heard that to spare an enemy for a day is to invite disaster for generations. If we consider our descendants, can we truly be said to dishonor our lord?" Thereupon, he issued the command, and the Jiang Rong were swiftly mobilized.

Duke Xiang wore mourning black. Liang Hong drove his chariot, with Lai Ju as his right-hand guard. In the fourth month, on the day *xinsi*, they defeated the Qin army at Xiao, capturing Baili Xi and Mengming Shi.

"Though they were fed to satiety, my lord, what disgrace would it bring to execute them? Let them return to Qin to face punishment and fulfill our lord’s will—what say you?" The duke consented. When Xian Zhen inquired about the Qin prisoners, the duke said, "The lady requested their release, and I granted it." Xian Zhen grew furious: "Warriors captured them through force on the battlefield, yet a woman’s momentary plea frees them across the land—undermining our military strength and emboldening our foes. Ruin will come swiftly!" He turned away and spat.

The duke sent Yang Chufu to pursue them. By the time he reached the Yellow River, they were already aboard their boats. He removed the left trace-horse and, in the duke’s name, presented it to Mengming. Mengming bowed deeply and said, "By your lord’s grace, you do not stain the war drum with the blood of a captive, but allow me to return to Qin to face execution. If our lord executes me at your lord’s behest, I shall die without regret. But if, by your lord’s mercy, I am spared, I shall bow in gratitude within three years."

Duke Mu of Qin, clad in plain robes, waited outside the city. Facing the returning army, he wept and said, "I defied Jian Shu and brought humiliation upon you—this is my fault. To dismiss Mengming would be my failing. What crime have my officers committed? I shall not let one misstep obscure their great virtue."

Jian Shu’s weeping foretold their defeat; Duke Mu’s weeping mourned their defeat—neither wept for victory.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Constantly Has No Name**
Though the uncarved block is small, none in the world dare claim dominion over it.

*Annotation:* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: "Heaven has ten suns; man has ten ranks. The lower serve the upper, and the upper provide for the gods. Men are called *ministers*, women *concubines*. Thus, the king’s ministers are dukes; the duke’s ministers are grandees; the grandee’s ministers are officers; the officer’s ministers are grooms; the groom’s ministers are charioteers; the charioteer’s ministers are laborers; the laborer’s ministers are servants; the servant’s ministers are menials; the menial’s ministers are pages. Horses have grooms, oxen have herders—to attend to all affairs."

If the lords and kings can hold to this,
*Annotation:* The king is the most exalted of the four seas; the marquis is the second of the five ranks. The Zhou established the five ranks of nobility—a system of the former kings—comprising the Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, ministers, grandees, and officers. The king encompasses all five.

Sweet dew shall descend.
*Annotation:* Sweet dew is the essence of divine emptiness, the blessing of benevolent omens. It congeals like fat, sweet as malt sugar, also called "heavenly wine." The *Astronomical Record* states: "The *Heavenly Breast* is a star north of the *Root* constellation, governing sweet dew. When the star shines brightly, sweet dew descends."

None command it, yet it spreads evenly of its own accord.
*Commentary:* From west to east.

The passage refers to the *Ode "Wen Wang You Sheng"* from the *Major Court Hymns* of the *Book of Songs*. It speaks of King Wu establishing the capital at Haojing, performing the *Biyong* ritual, and drawing observers from all directions who, moved by his virtue, submitted to his rule.

He began by establishing names.
*Annotation:* Mountains and forests do not seek birds, tigers, or wolves, yet their lush density naturally draws them. Rivers and lakes do not seek fish, turtles, or dragons, yet their vast expanse naturally draws them. Kings and lords do not seek fame, yet through virtue, benevolence, and kindness, they naturally draw all to them.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: "He Who Knows Others Is Wise"**
He who knows others is wise.
*Annotation:* Formerly, Duke Xuan of Song bypassed his son Yuyi to enthrone his younger brother, who became Duke Mu. In the autumn of the third year of Duke Yin’s reign, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Mu of Song, gravely ill, summoned the Grand Marshal Kongfu and entrusted him, saying: "The late ruler passed over Yuyi to install me. I dare not forget this. If by the grace of the ministers I may preserve my life until death, should the late ruler inquire of Yuyi, what answer shall I give? I ask you to support him and uphold the altars of the state. Though I die, I shall have no regrets." Kongfu replied: "The ministers wish to serve Prince Feng." Duke Mu said: "That cannot be. The late ruler deemed me worthy to govern the state. If I abandon virtue and refuse to yield, I would undo the late ruler’s decree—how could that be called worthy? Should I not strive to illuminate the late ruler’s virtuous legacy? You must not forsake his achievement." Thus, he sent his son Feng to reside in Zheng, yielding the throne to Yuyi, who became Duke Shang. The noble man says: "Duke Xuan of Song may be called one who knew others. By enthroning Duke Mu, he ensured his own son would inherit—his command was righteous."

He who does not lose his place endures.
*Annotation:* The favored younger brother of Zheng, Duan, was insatiable.

Minister Zhai Zhong admonished Duke Zhuang, saying: "It would be better to make early arrangements for him, lest he grow and spread like a creeping vine—once it spreads, it becomes difficult to manage. If even weeds are hard to eradicate, how much more so the lord’s favored younger brother?" Duke Zhuang did not heed his advice. Later, Duan ordered the western and northern borderlands to pledge allegiance to himself. He seized territory as far as Linyan, then fortified the city walls, gathered the people, repaired armor and weapons, and prepared troops and chariots, intending to launch a surprise attack on Zheng. The duke commanded Minister Zifeng to lead three hundred chariots to strike at Jing. Duan fled to Yan, and the duke pursued him there. In the fifth month, Duan fled to Gong, and Zheng prevailed.

Earlier, when Duke Zhuang was born, his mother Lady Wu Jiang had a difficult labor, and so he was named "Wusheng" ("Difficult Birth"). From then on, she despised Duke Zhuang and favored his younger brother, Duan. When Duan plotted to seize Zheng, Lady Wu Jiang was prepared to open the gates for him. After Duan was defeated, the duke confined Lady Wu Jiang to Chengying, swearing an oath: "Until we meet in the Yellow Springs, we shall not see each other again." Later, he regretted this. The border warden of Yinggu, Kao Shu, heard of it and presented himself to the duke. The duke granted him a meal, but Kao Shu set aside the meat. When the duke asked why, he replied: "This humble one has a mother who has tasted all my food but never your lordship’s broth. I beg to offer it to her." The duke said: "You have a mother to give to, while I alone have none." He then had the ground dug until the spring was reached, where he met Lady Wu Jiang in a tunnel, and they were mother and son as before. *The Spring and Autumn Annals* records: "The Earl of Zheng overcame Duan at Yan," criticizing his failure in instruction. This speaks of indulging Duan’s transgressions until they reached their full measure before punishing him—this was the consequence of not making early arrangements, of losing his proper place. Had Duan not lost his place, he would have endured in death without perishing.

*Annotation:* The *He Tu* states: "When a person is born, Heaven grants them a lifespan of forty-three thousand two hundred breaths, governing the days, and one hundred twenty cycles, governing the years. This is the allotted span of a human life." The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: "Even at one hundred twenty years, one may still recover from transgressions—this is truly difficult in guarding the Dao. Only by awaiting the ninefold refinement of the Eight Essences Elixir, re-cultivating essence, and meditating on the radiance of the Seven Origins and the sun and moon can one rescue the aged and infirm. This clarifies that cultivation can extend and augment life."

*Commentary:* Shan Bao and Zhang Yi are figures from the nineteenth chapter of the *Zhuangzi*, "Deviating from Life." As for death: the Son of Heaven is said to "pass away," feudal lords to "succumb," high ministers and great officers to "perish," scholars to "lose their emolument," and commoners to "die."

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Holding the Great Image**
Holding the Great Image, all under Heaven come to it.

The Meaning states: As for observing the sun and watching the winds—long ago, the Land of Juqu was situated amid the vast sea. Its envoys, presenting tribute to the Han court, addressed Emperor Wu, saying: "Our kingdom lies three hundred thousand *li* from here. In our land, we constantly observe the heavens. If an east wind enters the pitch-pipes and persists unceasing for a hundred days, while azure clouds encroach upon the *lü* tones and linger unbroken for months on end, it portends that the Middle Kingdom shall have a sovereign of the Dao. Our lord, revering the Central Land and admiring its Dao-wind, scorns gold and jade yet treasures numinous things. Thus, he traverses celestial forests to pacify fierce beasts, gathers rare treasures to produce divine incense, crosses the Weak Waters, fords the Flying Sands, and arrives at your court—thirteen years of arduous journeying, speaking of distant origins and near peace."

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Time to Gather In**
"The fish must not be removed from the depths."

The Meaning states: In the twenty-eighth year of Duke Xi’s reign, recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Wen of Jin provoked the wrath of Chu and went to war. He seized the Marquis of Cao at Song, whereupon Chu indeed attacked Song. Duke Wen then engaged Chu in battle, and the Chu forces were routed.

Duke Wen then summoned King Xiang of Zhou at Heyang, presenting the feudal lords to him and arranging for the king to conduct a royal hunt. Thus, he assembled the lords in grand convention, intending to honor the Son of Heaven in name and righteousness. Yet, mindful of his own might, he dared not pay court to Zhou. By feigning that the Celestial King had come forth to hunt, he fulfilled all the rites of lord and vassal—all cunning and improper acts.

Confucius said: "For a minister to summon his lord is a practice that cannot serve as a model." The *Annals* records: "The Celestial King hunted at Heyang," though that was not his proper place. If even such conduct is deemed deceitful and perverse, how much worse the machinations of treacherous ministers and petty men who manipulate power and deceive their lords?

*Preface to the Imperial Commentary on the* Dao and Its Virtue, *Scroll Two, completed.*

*Preface to the Imperial Commentary on the* Dao and Its Virtue, *Scroll Three*

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Highest Virtue Does Not Feign Virtue**
"Superior benevolence acts, yet without contrivance."

The Meaning states: "Minor favors are not yet trusted." This refers to the words of Cao Gui to Duke Zhuang of Lu, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the tenth year of Duke Zhuang. In the first month of that year, the duke defeated the Qi forces at Changshao. Before the battle, Cao Gui requested an audience.

His fellow villagers said: "Those who feast on meat devise the strategy—why inquire further?" Cao Gui replied: "Meat-feasters are coarse, incapable of far-reaching plans," and so he entered to seek an audience.

The duke asked how to engage in battle. Cao Gui answered: "That which sustains life through clothing and food, I dare not monopolize, but must share with others."
Cao Gui responded: "Minor favors do not extend universally; the people will not follow."
The duke said: "Sacrificial animals, jade, and silk—I dare not exaggerate, but must act with sincerity."
Cao Gui replied: "Minor sincerity does not inspire trust; the spirits will not bestow favor."
The duke said: "In cases great and small, though I cannot examine each in detail, I must judge with compassion."
Cao Gui said: "This is an attribute of loyalty; with this, one may fight a single battle." He then requested to accompany the duke. The duke rode with him, and they joined the battle at Changshao.

As the duke was about to sound the drum for attack, Cao Gui said: "Not yet."
After the Qi forces had beaten their drums thrice, Cao Gui said: "Now."
The Qi army was routed. The duke prepared to pursue, but Cao Gui said: "Not yet." He dismounted to inspect the chariot tracks, then ascended the crossbar to survey the field, declaring: "Now," and they pursued the Qi forces.

After victory, the duke asked the reason for his actions. Cao Gui replied: "Battle relies on courage. The first drumbeat rouses the spirit; the second, it wanes; the third, it is exhausted. When theirs was spent and ours full, we prevailed. Yet great perils are unpredictable—I feared an ambush. When I saw their tracks in disarray and their banners drooping, I knew we could pursue."

"Superior propriety acts, yet with contrivance."

**Commentary:** It establishes safeguards against crookedness.
**Exegesis:** Ritual is instituted to prevent the people from straying into crookedness. Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows.

**Exegesis:** In the twenty-sixth year of Duke Zhao of *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, Yanzi replied to Duke Jing of Qi: "Ritual as the foundation of the state stands alongside Heaven and Earth. When the ruler commands and the minister is reverent, when the father is kind and the son filial, when the elder brother is loving and the younger respectful, when the husband is harmonious and the wife gentle, when the mother-in-law is compassionate and the daughter-in-law obedient—this is ritual. When the ruler commands without transgression, the minister is reverent without duplicity, the father is kind and instructs, the son is filial and admonishes, the elder brother is loving and friendly, the younger is respectful and compliant, the husband is harmonious and righteous, the wife is gentle and upright, the mother-in-law is compassionate and yielding, the daughter-in-law is obedient and graceful—this is called the perfection of things."

The Duke said: "Excellent! From this day forth, I have heard of the supremacy of ritual."
Yanzi replied: "What the former kings received from Heaven and Earth, they established for their people—thus were the former kings supreme. Therefore, in governing the world, ritual is of the utmost urgency."

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: "Formerly, Those Who Obtained the One"**
When the lords and kings obtained the One, they became the standard for all under Heaven.

**Exegesis:** *The Spring and Autumn Annals* states: "The kings of today are the emperors of antiquity." Before Yao and Shun, all were called *Di* (Emperor). When Shun abdicated to Yu, Yu, in humility, claimed his virtue did not match that of the *Di*, and thus abandoned the title *Di* to become *Wang* (King). It is also said that when Yu died, he abdicated to Yi, but Yu’s son Qi dwelled on Mount Ji. Qi was worthy, so the feudal lords abandoned Yi and paid court to Qi. Though Yu had the reputation of abdicating to Yi, the people of the world all turned to Qi. Qi, deeming his virtue inferior to the Five Emperors, thus styled himself *Wang*. From then on, all adopted *Wang* as their title. When Qin unified the world, devoured the feudal lords, and stood alone as the sole power, it drew from the Three Sovereigns above and encompassed the Five Emperors below, combining them into the title *Huangdi* (Emperor). Today, the royal rank of *Wang* stands above the five noble ranks. Han law stipulated that none but the Liu clan could be *Wang*, and none but meritorious ministers could be *Hou*. From then on, the custom continued: the emperor’s many sons became *Wang*, with the eldest legitimate son as heir apparent. Since the Zhou dynasty ruled the world, the sons of kings were called *Wangzi* (Prince), and their grandsons *Wangsun* (Lord). In our dynasty’s established law, the emperor’s grandsons and nephews are made *Junwang* (Commandery Prince), with the heir designated *Siwang* (Hereditary Prince). Those of other surnames who rendered service are enfeoffed as *Wang*, sometimes granted honorific titles, or made *Junwang*, yet none hold territorial authority.

Heaven cannot remain clear.

**Exegesis:** During the *Yuan Kang* reign of Emperor Hui of Jin, the ruler’s virtue declined, and Heaven displayed calamitous omens. The sky split for several *zhang*, rumbling with sound—this was the loss of the harmonious Dao. From then on, the Western Jin fell into chaos, and Emperors Hui and Ai both suffered its consequences.

Earth cannot remain stable.

**Exegesis:** The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: In the second year of King You of Zhou, on the day *Xin-You*, the three rivers of the Western Zhou trembled, and Mount Qi collapsed. In the 242 years of *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, there were five earthquakes. There were also the collapses of Mount Liang and Mount Shalu, and the strange portents of speaking stones. From the Qin and Han dynasties onward, such events are too numerous to record—great ones submerged cities, while lesser ones toppled houses.

The spirits cannot retain their numinosity.

**Exegesis:** The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records: In the twelfth year of Duke Xi’s reign, in the seventh month, a spirit descended at Shen, and the Duke of Lu offered it a feast. King Hui of Zhou’s He-nei historian Guo asked: "What is the reason for this?" He replied: "When a state is about to rise, a luminous spirit descends to witness its virtue. When it is about to fall, a spirit also descends to observe its corruption. Thus, some gain spirits and prosper, while others gain spirits and perish. The Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties all experienced this. Guo’s virtue was cold and insincere—it was about to perish." Later, the state of Guo was indeed destroyed.

In the past, the River Spirit wrought tyranny, taking women from the people. Ximen Bao cast the witches into the river, and the harm ceased.

The valleys cannot remain full.

**Exegesis:** The Venerable Lord Laozi said: "When the Yi and Luo rivers dried up, the Xia perished; when the Yellow River ran dry, the Shang perished. In the year *Xin-You* of King You of Zhou, the rivers dried and the mountains collapsed—this was the omen of Zhou’s fall. Destruction came within ten years, for ten is the limit of fate. When the number reaches ten, the cycle is complete. In the eleventh year, *Geng-Shen*, the Western Zhou was destroyed by the Quanrong, and King Ping moved east."

The feudal lords and kings cannot retain their lofty nobility.

**Exegesis:** Among the feudal lords were Duke Ling of Jin (Yi Gao), Duke Zhao of Song (Chu Jiu), Duke Yi of Qi (Shang Ren), and Duke Ling of Chen (Ping Guo). Among the kings were Tai Kang of Xia, Wu Yi of Shang, and You and Li of Zhou, as well as Huan and Ling of Han.

**Subcommentary:** Heaven generates the myriad things, but only humans are endowed with spirit.

**Exegesis:** This is from the *Book of Documents*, in the "Great Declaration" chapter.

Thus, the noble takes the humble as its root.

**Subcommentary:** The people are the foundation of the state, as the *Odes* says: "A joyful and kind-hearted lord."

**Exegesis:** This is from the *Book of Documents*, in the "Five Sons’ Song" chapter. "Joyful and kind-hearted" is a phrase from the *Odes*, in the "Great Elegantiae" section, from the "Dong Zhuo" ode.

Therefore, feudal lords and kings refer to themselves as "the solitary," "the bereft," or "the unworthy."

**Subcommentary:** "The solitary" and "the two or three ministers" grieve over their lost plans.

**Exegesis:** "The solitary" and "the two or three ministers" refers to the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, seventh year of Duke Zhao: In the second month, the Viscount of Chu completed the Zhanghua Terrace and wished to invite the feudal lords to its inauguration. The inauguration is the ritual of offering the first sacrifice upon the completion of a palace. Minister Wei Qijiang said: "Your servant can secure the presence of the Duke of Lu." Wei Qijiang came to summon the Duke, who declined, saying: "In the past, our late lord Duke Cheng commanded our minister Ying Qi: ‘We have not forgotten the friendship of our predecessors. We will send Hengfu to oversee the state of Chu, to pacify its altars and bring peace to its people.’ Ying Qi received this command at Shu and swore an oath, recorded in the second year of Duke Cheng. Since then, we have upheld it without fail, and it has been passed down through our ancestral temple. From our late lord Duke Gong, we have stretched our necks northward, yearning day and night. The succession has been handed down through four kings—namely, Gong, Kang, Jia’ao, and Ling. Yet no gracious favor has reached us, save for Duke Xiang’s condescension to attend our mourning. The solitary and the two or three ministers grieve over our lost plans, with no leisure to tend to the altars, let alone cherish the virtue of our lord. Now, if you would deign to step forth with jade footsteps and honor our humble lord with your presence, bestowing your radiant grace upon Chu and fulfilling the pledge of the Shu campaign, thereby conveying your lord’s benevolence—then our humble lord would have already received your kindness. How could we dare hope for the Shu campaign? The spirits of our former lords would truly rejoice in this, not merely our humble lord. If you do not come, your servant will inquire about the date of your journey. Our humble lord will present gifts of silk and meet you at Shu to seek the blessing of our former lords." The Duke was about to go when he dreamed of Duke Xiang’s ancestral spirit. Zimu said: "The Duke will not go after all." When Duke Xiang went to Chu, he dreamed of the Duke of Zhou’s ancestral spirit leading the way. Now that Duke Xiang’s spirit truly leads, you should not go. Zifu Huibo said: "Go. Our former lord never went to Chu, so the Duke of Zhou’s spirit led the way. Duke Xiang went to Chu, and now his spirit leads you. If you do not go, where will you go?" In the third month, the Duke went to Chu. The Earl of Zheng received him at Shi’s Bridge. Meng Xizi served as his second, but could not assist with ritual propriety. Upon reaching Chu, he could not respond to the welcoming rites at the suburbs. In the fourth month, the Duke was feasted at the Xintai, where long-maned attendants were appointed to assist, and fine bows of great curvature were presented. Later, the Duke regretted this, and Wei Qijiang, hearing of it, came to see him. The Duke told him, and Wei bowed in congratulation. The Duke asked: "Why congratulate me?" He replied: "Qi and Jin have long coveted this, but our humble lord had no one to give it to—until it was passed to you. You must prepare defenses against our three neighbors and guard this treasure well. How could I not congratulate you?" The Duke grew fearful and made amends. This illustrates that Duke Ling of Chu was untrustworthy, which is why he did not endure.

In the ninth month, the Duke personally went to Chu. Meng Xizi, being ill, could not assist with the rites. Thereupon, he began to study and teach, allowing those who could perform the rites to follow him. He then ordered Nangong Jingshu and his subordinates to study ritual with Confucius.

Confucius and Jingshu traveled to Zhou, where they inquired about ritual from Laozi.

*Commentary: The use of "Guaren" (the humble one) follows the precedent of former lords who deemed "Guaren" a worthy designation.*
*Exegesis: As explained in the thirty-third section of the preceding passage on "he who knows others is wise," it will not be repeated here.*
*Commentary: The use of "Bugu" (the unworthy one) follows the precedent of despising those who lack sincere virtue.*
*Exegesis: In the eleventh year of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Qin and Jin sought reconciliation and were to meet at Linghu. The Marquis of Jin arrived first, but the Earl of Qin refused to cross the Yellow River. The Earl of Qin (Duke Huan of Qin) encamped at Wangcheng and sent his grandee, Shi Ke, to swear an oath with the Marquis of Jin (Duke Li of Jin) east of the river. Xi Luo of Jin swore an oath with the Earl of Qin west of the river. Fan Wenzi said: "What benefit does this oath bring? The purpose of oaths is to establish trust through words, and meetings are the beginning of trust. If the beginning is not followed, how can it serve as a pledge?" The Earl of Qin returned and betrayed Jin. In the thirteenth year, on the *wuwu* day of the fourth month, the Marquis of Jin sent Lü Xiang to sever ties with Qin. By then, Duke Huan of Qin had already sworn the Linghu oath with Duke Li of Jin, yet he also summoned the Di and Chu, intending to lead them in attacking Jin. The feudal lords thus drew closer to Jin. Lü Xiang addressed the Earl of Qin, saying: "The people of Chu detest your inconsistency in virtue and have also come to inform us, saying: 'Qin has betrayed the Linghu oath and now seeks an alliance with us. We hereby proclaim to august Heaven, the Supreme Emperor, the Three Lords of Qin, and the Three Kings of Chu: Though we have dealings with Jin, we ally only with what benefits us. We despise those who lack sincere virtue and thus make this known to punish disunity.' The feudal lords have all heard these words, and so, with aching hearts and gnashing teeth, they draw near to us. We, in turn, have led them to heed your command, seeking only goodwill. If you graciously favor the feudal lords and grant them an alliance, we shall support and pacify them before withdrawing. If you do not bestow this great kindness, we, being unworthy, cannot lead the feudal lords to retreat. We humbly lay this before your attendants, that they may deliberate upon it." Jin’s Yue Shu, Shi Xie, Han Jue, and Zhao Zhan led the four armies. Xi Kui drove the war chariot, and Yue Zhen served as the right guard. On the *dinghai* day of the fifth month, the Marquis of Jin, leading the allied armies of the feudal lords, fought the Qin forces at Masui. The Qin army was routed, and Cheng Qiang of Qin, along with the officer Ru Fu, were captured. This illustrates that the Earl of Qin broke his oath, that Qin was at fault and Jin was in the right, and that defeat was the consequence.*

*Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Man Hears the Dao*
*The Dao advances as if it retreats.*

Here follows the translation:

---

The *Yijue* states: Li Yiqi begged for food among the mortal realm; Yin Changsheng endured humiliation in the marketplace; Hou Daohua concealed his traces as a hired laborer; Huangfu Ta feigned illness in the wooded hills; Shengzi feigned madness; and Master Hu concealed his brilliance. All these exemplars humbled themselves and diminished their aspirations, only thus soaring toward the heights and merging with the True.

**"Vast virtue appears insufficient."**

*Commentary:* The excellent merchant...
*The Yijue* states: The *Records of the Grand Historian* recounts that Confucius, accompanied by Nangong Jingshu, journeyed to Zhou to inquire of Laozi about ritual propriety. Laozi said: "The men of whom you speak are now but dust and bone; only their words remain. I have heard that the excellent merchant conceals his treasures as if his store were empty, and the noble man of abundant virtue bears the countenance of a fool. Shed your arrogance and excess desire, your affected manner and extravagant ambition—none of these benefit your person. What I tell you is just this."

**"The great square has no corners."**

*Commentary:* "Polished yet dyed black..."
*The Yijue* states: This is from the *Analects*, in the "Yang Huo" chapter.

**"Great vessels are slow to complete."**

*The Yijue* states: That which equips things for use is called a "vessel." In the ninth year of Duke Ding of *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Yang Hu returned treasured jades—the *xiahoumin* jade tablet and the great bow *Fengfu’s Luxuriant Might*—recording the event as "obtained vessels." Generally, to obtain vessels is called *de*, and to obtain their use is called *huo*. Thus, a vessel is that which equips things for use.

**"Thus, some things are diminished yet gain."**

*Commentary:* The *Book of Documents* states: "Fullness invites diminishment..."
*The Yijue* states: These are the words from the "Counsels of Great Yu" in the *Book of Documents*.

**"The strong and overbearing do not meet their proper end."**

*Commentary:* The Immortal Yan...
*The Yijue* states: Yan Zun, styled Junping, of Shu Commandery, often practiced divination in the marketplace of Chengdu, subtly transforming people through the Dao. When questioned with improper intent, he invariably restrained and corrected them with the principles of yin and yang. Daily, he earned a hundred coins before closing his shop and lowering the curtain, composing the *Zhigui* (Pointers to the *Dao and Its Virtue*) in fourteen scrolls.

**Chapter Forty-Three: The Softest Under Heaven**
**"The teaching without words."**

---

**Commentary:** The nine schools and the hundred masters.

*The Yijue* states: The "nine schools" are as follows, according to the *Book of Han*: The Daoist school enables one to unify the spirit, act in accord with the formless, and suffice for the myriad things. Its methods follow the great harmony of yin and yang, shift with the times, respond to things with transformation, and are rooted in purity and emptiness for self-preservation, humility and softness for self-sustenance—this is the art of the ruler facing south.

The Confucian school, originating from the office of the Minister of Education, assists the ruler in illuminating moral transformation, tracing its lineage to Yao and Shun, modeling itself on Wen and Wu, and taking Confucius as its master to lend weight to its words. It is the highest in the Dao, and this is its strength. Yet it may lose its subtlety and become biased, or bend with the times, straying from the root of the Dao, merely seeking to please the crowd and accommodate others—such are the flaws of later, perverse Confucians.

The School of Names originates from the Spring Office, where ranks differ and rites vary accordingly. Confucius said: "It is essential to rectify names"—this is its strength. But when taken to excess, it becomes mere hair-splitting and sophistry.

The School of Diplomacy originates from the office of the Messenger. Confucius said: "One sent on a mission to the four quarters cannot be expected to improvise replies," and also: "A messenger! A messenger!"—meaning one must weigh affairs and adapt to circumstances, receiving commands but not the words. This is its strength. Yet when practiced deceitfully, it values cunning and abandons trust.

The Eclectic school originates from the office of the Counselor, blending Confucianism and Mohism, combining the Schools of Names and Laws—this is its strength. But when taken to excess, it becomes aimless and without a guiding principle.

The Agricultural school originates from the office of the Minister of Agriculture, sowing the five grains to ensure ample clothing and food. The *Great Plan* lists eight policies, the first being food—this is its strength. Yet when vulgarized, it seeks to make gentlemen till the soil alongside commoners.

The School of Minor Talks originates from the office of the Recorder of Popular Sayings. "Bai" means small grain; the ruler, wishing to know customs, established this office to gather street gossip and alleyway discussions. Confucius said: "Even in minor ways there is something worth observing, but pursuing them too far may lead to entanglement"—this is also the meaning of "the words of grass-cutters and madmen."

The Mohist school originates from the attendants of the ancestral temple, with thatched roofs and rough-hewn rafters, selecting worthy men and esteeming those who yield. The Yin-Yang school originates from the astronomical office and the theory of the Five Phases, leading people to excessive taboos and restrictions.

The Military school originates from the office of the Minister of War, serving to awe those who defy the law and manifest civil virtue, to annex the weak and attack the benighted, to curb disorder and pacify the four quarters—this is its might.

The "hundred masters" refer to those outside the Six Classics and orthodox histories who established their own doctrines and composed works. Since the Zhou dynasty, over a hundred individuals have set forth principles and written books, all called "Masters." "Master" is a general term for men; not daring to equate themselves with the Six Classics, they are all designated as "Masters," whether in treatises, records, or books. Some are named after their surnames, others by their era or title—examples include Master Yuchang, Master Zeng, Master Yan, Master Meng, Master Guan, Master Xunqing, Master Lulian, Master Lie, Master Zhuang, Master Gengsang, Master Wangsun, Master Yinwen, Master Gongsun Ni, *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals*, Deng Xi (also called Master Xishi), and Master Guigu.

**Chapter Forty-Four: Name and Life**
**Name and life—which is dearer?**

*The Yijue* states: Boyi died for benevolence, Nie Zheng died for righteousness, Weisheng died for trust, Jing Ke died for courage, Long Feng died for remonstrance, Wu Yun died for loyalty, Jie Zitui died for resentment—all achieved fame but lost their lives, their bones scattered, faces flayed, hearts carved out, burned by fire or drowned in water, eyes gouged by swords. They brought ruin upon themselves.

**Excessive love must lead to great loss; hoarding wealth must lead to heavy ruin.**

**Commentary:** The harm of prizing jade is like holding a jade disk; the tomb-robbing of the refined is only for the pearls within.

*The Yijue* states: As for prizing jade, in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the tenth year of Duke Huan, Yu Gong’s younger brother Yu Shu possessed a jade. Yu Gong demanded it, but Yu Shu refused. Later, Yu Shu regretted it, saying: "There is a Zhou proverb: 'A commoner is blameless, but possessing a jade disk is a crime.' Why do I need this? It will only bring harm." He then presented it. Yu Gong further demanded his precious sword. Yu Shu said: "He is insatiable. If he is insatiable, it will reach me—I fear he will kill me." He then attacked Yu Gong, who fled to Hongchi.

As for the tomb-robbing of the refined, this is a saying from the Outer Chapters of the *Zhuangzi*.

**Chapter Forty-Five: Great Perfection Seems Deficient**
**Restlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat.**

**Annotation states:** The *Tian Yuan Jing* says: After the Beginning of Summer, the sun travels along the north of the earth, entering the ground shallowly, thus nights are short and days long—this brings heat. After the Beginning of Autumn, the sun travels along the south of the earth, entering the ground deeply, thus nights are long and days short—this brings coolness. The sun’s distance from the pole varies, giving rise to warmth, coolness, cold, and heat. Thus, cold and heat, restlessness and stillness, are the movements of yang qi.

As for the ruler who employs the Dao, governing through non-action brings order: his governance is still, and all things thrive; the state is secure, and the people are at peace. The four frontiers submit in allegiance; the five weapons lie unused. Clarity and emptiness congeal in tranquility; purity and silence abide in harmony. Deceit dares not encroach; violence dares not rage. Beacon fires remain unlit; war drums do not startle. Within the seas, all is serene—this is stillness prevailing.

When his transformative influence reaches its height, songs of praise resound in unison; reverence and deference flourish. The ninefold circuits harmonize; the four gates stand solemn. Ritual is established; music is composed. The worthy are elevated; the capable are employed. Ships and carriages converge in hope at his court; written laws and axle-tracks align with his governance. The eight frontiers gather in submission; the myriad regions hasten in allegiance. Heaven and earth respond in resonance; humans and spirits commune in harmony. All under heaven transforms in radiant accord with the Dao.

Within, there is no scheming through cracks; without, there are no neighboring states watching for openings. They sing of it, savor it, dance to it, and leap in joy—this is the achievement of stillness, governance, and non-action.

If, however, the ruler is restless and reckless, his ministers deceitful and cunning, stirring up arms and flaunting power and favor—mobilizing a million-strong army to ascend the Chanyu’s terrace, banners stretching a thousand *li* to cross the shores of the Pei and Liao—then the old and weak are pressed into labor, women compelled to transport supplies. The four seas seethe; the six directions convulse. When the people are exhausted, households dwindle, lives are uprooted, the wilds lie deserted, and ghosts wail by day—this is the consequence of restlessness prevailing.

**Chapter Forty-Six: When All Under Heaven Possesses the Dao**
**Annotation states:** When the sage rules the realm, he bears the ceremonial axe and faces south.

When shamans stand before and scribes behind, with diviners and blind musicians arrayed to left and right, one governs through non-action and upholds perfect rectitude. The Three Dukes attend court, the Three Elders reside in the academy, and the myriad officials fulfill their duties—cultivating civil virtue to embrace distant lands, spreading the transformative power of the Dao to nurture the people, so that customs become harmonious and peaceful, households flourish in ritual propriety, and tribute flows in from the four frontiers. The three borders see no military campaigns; shields and spears are upturned, warhorses retired to pasture, oxen returned to the plow. Then the people delight in tilling the soil, enriching the fields, and the harvests grow thick as clouds, with surplus grain spilling over the furrows. Should one deviate from this path, however, resentful enemies will invade in concert, warhorses gallop unchecked, and armor and weapons are once more put to use—such are the works of a realm without the Dao.

When all under heaven possesses the Dao, warhorses are sent back to fertilize the fields.

**Annotation states:** The ancients said: "The ruler is like a boat; the people are like water. Without the ruler, the people cannot be governed; without water, the boat cannot move. Boat and water depend on each other and cannot be separated even for a moment. Thus, the foundation of governing a state lies first in nurturing the people." When a ruler abides by the Dao, his guardianship extends to the four barbarian tribes; beyond his borders, there are no military incursions, halberds lie unused, and blades and arrowheads remain sheathed. Armor is set aside at the three borders, and fields are opened across the four wildernesses. Deep plowing and shallow sowing ensure that households are well-provided and the state grows prosperous. Food is the people’s heaven—its cultivation is the greatest of all tasks. As the *Record of Rites* says: "Man is the virtue of heaven and earth, the convergence of yin and yang, the meeting of ghosts and spirits, the finest essence of the five phases. Thus, when the sage establishes norms, he must take heaven and earth as his foundation, yin and yang as his starting point, the four seasons as his handle, the sun and stars as his markers, ghosts and spirits as his companions, the five phases as his substance, ritual propriety as his vessel, human sentiment as his field, and the four sacred creatures as his livestock. Therefore, human sentiment is the sage-king’s field. When the field of sentiment is cultivated through non-action, it approaches the Dao."

When all under heaven lacks the Dao, warhorses breed in the suburbs.

**Annotation states:** If a state is governed without the Dao, its rulers will expand borders and invade barbarian lands, leaving frontiers restless and conscription unending. Some, coveting spices, launch campaigns against distant Fan Yu; others, desiring fine horses, raise armies against Da Yuan. Bones pile in the barren wilds, blood soaks the grassy marshes, souls drift and scatter in foreign lands, and war chariots sink into the distant suburbs. Years stretch on in endless campaigns, and soldiers do not return even when the melons ripen. Transport never ceases, and the looms stand empty. The people resent, the state perishes—such calamities are not heaven-sent but arise from what should be deeply guarded against. How much better to keep the realm undisturbed, so that the feudal lords all submit, ruler and people harmonize, and superiors and inferiors protect one another. Then the strong have no outlet for their strength, the eloquent no stage for their words, warriors no edge for their blades, and the wise no chance to deploy their strategies. Swords and halberds are recast into plows and hoes; daggers are traded in the market for oxen to till the fields. Without action or conscription, the people preserve their lives and secure their futures.

No crime is greater than indulging desire.

**Annotation states:** The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records: "In the twentieth year of Duke Xi, Duke Xiang of Song sought to unite the feudal lords. Zang Wenzhong, a minister of Lu, heard of this and said: 'To follow others in fulfilling one’s desires is acceptable, but to make others follow one’s desires rarely succeeds.' This means bending one’s own desires to align with the greater good. The following year, the Duke of Song convened the Alliance at Lu Shang. Gongzi Mu Yi of Song remarked: 'When small states vie for leadership in alliances, they are fortunate to escape defeat.' That autumn, the men of Chu seized the Duke of Song and attacked his state—this illustrates how making others follow one’s desires strays from the Dao."

No misfortune is greater than covetousness.

**Annotation states:** The *Scripture of Laozi’s Repentance* states: "The first transgression is called a sin, also known as a fault. *Guo* (fault) means error. Committing 1,080 faults leads to calamity, and calamity is weightier than sin. Committing 1,260 faults leads to *jiu* (misfortune), and misfortune is weightier still than calamity."

**Chapter Forty-Seven: Without Leaving the Door**

**Commentary:** To concentrate the spirit and sit upright behind the screen.
**Annotation states:** *Ning* means stillness. *Duan* means solemn dignity. *Yi* refers to the dragon screen, meaning to lean against it—its form resembles a folding screen, painted with axe patterns, placed between the windows of the Bright Hall. In ancient times, the Duke of Zhou assisted King Cheng in the Bright Hall to receive the feudal lords, standing with his back to the axe-screen facing south, thereby establishing the proper positions of ruler and minister.

**Chapter Forty-Eight: Daily Advancement in Learning**
Daily advancement in learning.
**Annotation states:** *Learning* means awakening and enlightenment, referring to guiding one’s nature and emotions with the Way of the former kings to achieve understanding. In youth, one is benighted and unenlightened, unfit for learning; in maturity, one becomes obstinate and resistant, difficult to instruct. There are three timelinesses in learning:

First, the timeliness within the human body: after the age of thirteen, one may begin to study, as the *Record of Learning* states: "If restraint is imposed only after impulses arise, resistance will prevail; if learning begins only after the proper time has passed, it will be arduous and difficult to succeed."

Second, the timeliness within the year: the *Nei Ze* states: "In raising a child, at six years, teach them to count from one to ten, then to a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, and to recognize directions—east, west, south, and north. At seven, boys and girls do not share the same mat nor eat together. At eight, they learn to enter and exit doors and take their seats at meals, always deferring to elders—this teaches them deference. At nine, they are taught the days of the month, the new and full moons, and the heavenly stems from *jia* to *gui*, as well as the six *jia* days. At ten, they go to external tutors, reside outside the home, and study writing and arithmetic. At thirteen, they learn the *Shao* dance and recite the *Odes*—recitation means reading aloud from memory. At fifteen, as youths, they learn the *Xiang* dance, archery, and charioteering. First, they perform the *Yue* dance, where the *yue* resembles a flute, held while performing the civil dance; later, they perform the *Xiang* dance, the martial dance. At twenty-four, they undergo the capping ceremony and begin to study ritual. At thirty, they marry, manage affairs of men, and study without fixed method. At forty, they enter office, offering counsel and devising plans. At fifty, they assume governance—this is the sequence."

Third, the timeliness within the day: learning is more readily absorbed when aligned with the seasons and qi. The *Royal Regulations* states: "In spring and summer, study the *Odes* and refined speech, for spring and summer are yang, and yang is light and clear—poetry and music are sounds, and sounds are naturally light and clear. In autumn and winter, study writing and ritual, for autumn and winter are yin, and yin is heavy and turbid—writing and ritual are affairs, and affairs are naturally heavy and turbid. Practicing light and clear studies in light and clear seasons, and heavy and turbid studies in heavy and turbid seasons, ensures that their qi resonate and are easily absorbed."

**Chapter Fifty: Birth and Death in the World of Humans**
Thirteen paths lead to the realm of death.
**Annotation states:** In receiving life, humans possess three karmic actions and ten evils. The three karmic actions are: first, bodily action; second, mental action; and third, verbal action. The ten evils are: bodily action has three evils—killing living beings, theft, and sexual misconduct. Mental action also has three evils—greed, anger, and delusion. Verbal action has four—divisive speech, harsh speech, false speech, and frivolous speech. These three karmic actions and ten evils together make thirteen.

Restraint leads to life; indulgence leads to death. Each of these ten evils has four conditions, all rooted in afflictions. What are they?

For the sin of killing: four conditions—first, the being is truly alive; second, one conceives the thought that it is a living being; third, one harbors the intention to kill; fourth, one causes its life to end.

For the sin of theft: four conditions—first, the object truly belongs to another; second, one conceives the thought that it is another’s property; third, one harbors the intention to steal; fourth, one moves it from its original place.

For the sin of sexual misconduct: four conditions—first, the object is truly an improper partner; second, one conceives the thought that it is an improper partner; third, one generates the intention for sexual misconduct; fourth, the body experiences defiled pleasure.

For the sin of divisive speech: four conditions—first, the person is truly one who has been heard; second, one conceives the thought of that person; third, one generates the intention to sow discord; fourth, one utters speech that creates division.

For the sin of harsh speech: four conditions—first, the person is truly one who is cursed; second, one conceives the thought of that person; third, one generates the intention to curse; fourth, one utters abusive language.

For the sin of false speech: four conditions—first, the person is truly one who is deceived; second, one conceives the thought of that person; third, one generates the intention to deceive; fourth, one makes statements that are untrue.

For the sin of frivolous speech: four conditions—first, the person is truly one who is deceived; second, one conceives the thought of that person; third, one generates the intention for frivolous speech; fourth, one utters words that are improper.

In total, these ten evil actions comprise fifty-three conditions.

Traveling by land, one does not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers.

As the *Yi* states: The Xiao and Xiang Rivers flow from Mount Jiuyi and Lingling, where rhinoceroses and tigers dwell. In former times, Guo Wen of the Jin, styled Wenju, dwelt in Mount Dadi of Yuhang. He lived among tigers, and whenever he went to the city, the tigers would follow him. Someone asked him, "Sir, do you possess the Dao? How is it that these wild beasts are so tame and docile?" Wenju replied, "When humans harbor no intent to harm beasts, beasts harbor no intent to harm humans—what art is there in this? The tigers had no use for their claws."

The *Yi* further relates: As recorded in the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*, Liu Gang, styled Boluan, and his wife, Madam Fan, both attained the Dao of divine transcendence. When Gang served as magistrate of Shangyu, he traveled to Mount Siming and encountered a tiger. The tiger, seeing Gang, prostrated itself and dared not rise. Gang told his wife of this, and she went directly to the mountain, tied the tiger with a rope, and brought it home like a household dog. This was surely the power of virtue that subdued it.

**Chapter Fifty-Two: The World Has a Beginning**
To perceive the small is called clarity.

**Commentary:** "Worry, regret, and misfortune" are from the *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes*.

**Chapter Fifty-Three: Let Me Be Firmly Resolved**
Girded with a sword of profit.

**Annotation:** On military preparedness—In the summer of the tenth year of Duke Ding’s reign, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Confucius met with Duke Jing of Qi at Jiagu while acting as steward. He said: "Your servant has heard that where there are civil affairs, there must be military preparedness; where there is military preparedness, there must be civil preparedness. When the feudal lords cross borders, they must bring their officials in attendance. I request that you prepare your left and right marshals." Duke Ding consented. At the meeting site, an altar was raised with three tiers of earthen steps, and they exchanged courtesies according to ritual, ascending with bows. After the exchange of toasts, the Qi envoys sent men of Lai, armed and drumming wildly, to seize Duke Ding. Confucius ascended the steps in haste, stopping one tier short of the top, and withdrew the Duke, saying: "Send forth the soldiers! Our two lords meet in friendship, yet these barbarian captives dare disrupt it with arms—this is not how the Lord of Qi commands the feudal lords. Barbarians do not scheme against the Central States; Yi tribes do not disturb Hua; captives do not violate covenants; arms do not threaten amity. Before the gods, this is inauspicious; in virtue, it is a breach of righteousness; among men, it is a breach of propriety. My lord would surely not permit this." The Marquis of Qi, conscience-stricken, waved them away. After a while, the Marquis of Qi presented palace musicians, and actors and dwarves performed before the Duke. Confucius strode forward, ascended the steps, stopping one tier short, and said: "Commoners who deceive and insult the feudal lords deserve execution. Let the officials swiftly apply the law." Thereupon, the dwarves were slain, their limbs severed. The Marquis of Qi, terrified, showed shame. After the covenant with the feudal lords, he reproached his ministers, saying: "Lu aids its lord with the Way of the noble man, while you alone instruct me in the ways of barbarians, causing me to offend the Lord of Lu." He then returned the seized lands of Yun, Huan, and Guiyin to Lu—this is civil affairs and military preparedness.

**Chapter Fifty-Four: What Is Well Established Cannot Be Uprooted**
What is well established cannot be uprooted.

**Commentary:** Let models of conduct inspire trust.

**Annotation:** The *Book of Songs* in the *Greater Odes* states: "Take King Wen as your model, and the myriad states will place their trust in you." *Fu* means "trust." King Wen extended the Dao in his teachings, and the myriad states submitted in faith.

Cultivate it in your household.

**Commentary:** The *Book of Changes* says: "The household that accumulates goodness..."

**Annotation:** This is from the *Wenyan* commentary on the *Kun* hexagram.

Cultivate it throughout the world.

**Annotation:** When the Son of Heaven savors the Dao and delights in the profound, reveres Heaven and follows Earth, concentrates his mind in mysterious stillness, rectifies himself through non-action, unifies the standards of writing, and accepts tribute from distant lands, the Four Yi submit in sincerity, and the myriad states come to pay homage. The Dao extends without exception, and his virtue is universally pervasive. The ancestral temple is where the Son of Heaven conducts the affairs of state.

When virtue is universally bestowed—The *Xiang* commentary on the *Qian* hexagram in the *Book of Changes* states: "The dragon appears in the field; virtue is universally bestowed."

Observe the world through the world.

**Annotation:** If the ruler does not cultivate it, he becomes like Jie or Zhou.

When the people suffer in misery, the realm falls into rebellion, kin turn against one another as enemies, and lives are lost in bloodshed—even with wise ministers and valiant warriors, they cannot be put to use. Even with fortified cities and boiling moats, they cannot be defended. Though one may hold the noble rank of ten thousand chariots, the chance to live as a common man remains unattainable.

When the ruler cultivates the Way, he becomes like Yao or Shun: within the Four Seas, every household is worthy of enfeoffment; benevolence and kindness extend even to distant courts; and the calendar is proclaimed throughout the myriad lands. Though floods and droughts may strike, the harvest remains unharmed. Though armies march to war, the people bear no resentment.

*Commentary on the Daode Zhenjing by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Scroll Three, Concluded*

*Scroll Four of the Commentary on the Daode Zhenjing by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang*
**Chapter Fifty-Five: "Abundant in Virtue"**

The bones are supple, the sinews soft, yet the grasp is firm.

*Annotation:* As the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records: When the men of Yun attacked Chu, Qu Xia was troubled. Dou Lian said to him, "Victory in war lies in harmony, not in numbers—this was so for Shang and Zhou, as you well know." Qu Xia wished to divine the outcome, but Dou Lian replied, "Divination resolves doubt; where there is no doubt, why divine?" They then defeated the army of Yun at Pusao.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: "Governing the State by Rectitude"**
"Employing the extraordinary in warfare."

*Commentary:* Warfare is like fire.

*Annotation:* As the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: In the spring of the fourth year of Duke Yin’s reign, Gongzi Zhouxu of Wei murdered his lord, Wan. Earlier, Duke Zhuang of Wei had taken a wife from Qi, the sister of Donggong Decen, named Zhuang Jiang. Though beautiful, she bore no son, and the people of Wei composed the poem *"The Stately Lady"* for her. He also took a wife from Chen, named Li Gui, who bore Xiaobo, who died young. Her younger sister, Dai Gui, bore Duke Huan, whom Zhuang Jiang raised as her own. Gongzi Zhouxu was the son of a palace concubine; favored and fond of arms, he was not restrained. Zhuang Jiang detested him. Shi Que admonished the duke, saying, "I have heard that to love a son is to teach him the proper way, lest he stray into depravity. Arrogance, extravagance, dissipation, and idleness—these are the paths to depravity. When these four arise, it is because favor and emolument have been excessive."

Should the intent to enthrone Zhouxu be settled early, then let it be settled early. If it remains unresolved, it will become the very step that invites calamity. Now, those who are favored yet not arrogant, arrogant yet able to yield, yielding yet without resentment, resentful yet able to restrain themselves—such men are rare indeed. Moreover, the lowly encroaching upon the noble, the young overbearing the elder, the distant estranging the near, the new supplanting the old, the lesser dominating the greater, and excess undermining righteousness—these are the six forms of rebellion. The lord acting with propriety and the minister with loyalty, the father with kindness and the son with filial piety, the elder brother with affection and the younger with respect—these are the six forms of harmony. To abandon harmony and emulate rebellion is to hasten disaster. As one who rules over men, you must strive to eliminate calamity, yet you would hasten it—is this not unacceptable?

The lord did not heed his counsel. Shi Que’s son, Shi Hou, befriended Zhouxu and could not be dissuaded. When Duke Huan ascended the throne, Shi Que retired. On the *wushen* day of the second month, Zhouxu murdered Duke Huan and usurped the rulership. Seeking to avenge the grievances of his late lord against Zheng and to curry favor with the feudal lords to pacify his people, he dispatched envoys to Song, saying: "If you, my lord, would lead an expedition against Zheng to remove its threat to you, and take command, our humble state will follow with Chen and Cai in support—this is the wish of the state of Wei." The lord of Song agreed. Thereupon, Chen and Cai, desiring to align with Wei, joined Song, Chen, Cai, and Wei in attacking Zheng, besieging its eastern gate for five days before withdrawing.

The Duke of Song sought reinforcements from Lu, but Lu declined. Duke Yin of Lu inquired of Zhongzhong: "Will Zhouxu succeed?" He replied: "I have heard that one harmonizes the people through virtue, not through disorder to govern disorder. Governing disorder is like sorting tangled silk—only to entangle it further. Zhouxu murdered his lord and cruelly exploited his people. He does not cultivate virtuous governance but seeks to succeed through chaos. He will not escape ruin."

Zhouxu, unable to pacify his people, asked Shi Hou how to secure his rule. Shi Hou consulted Shi Que, who said: "An audience with the king would suffice." Hou asked: "How may one obtain such an audience?" Shi Que replied: "Duke Huan of Chen currently enjoys the king’s favor, and Chen and Wei are on good terms. If you go to Chen and request an introduction, it will surely be granted." Shi Hou accompanied Zhouxu to Chen, where Shi Que sent word: "Wei is a small and narrow state, and I, an old man, am feeble and incapable. These two men murdered my lord. I humbly urge you to take action against them." The men of Chen arrested them and sought Wei’s consent to execute them. In the ninth month, the people of Wei dispatched Youzai Chou to execute Zhouxu at Pu. Shi Que instructed his steward, Ru Naihou, to kill Shi Hou in Chen.

The gentleman remarks: "Shi Que was a minister of pure loyalty. Though he despised Zhouxu, his own son was complicit. He upheld the great principle of severing kinship for righteousness—this is what is meant by such a saying. For a son to follow a regicidal traitor is the gravest treason against the state, which cannot be left unpunished. Thus, it is called 'severing kinship for righteousness.' If lesser principles were observed, one would love one’s son without distinction. Yet men often resort to cunning and deceit."

Virtue states: *The Spring and Autumn Annals* records the painting of pillars in Duke Huan’s palace and the carving of the corners of its rafters—these are the beams—and criticizes them, just as it censures Zang Wenzhong’s "mountain-shaped capitals and water-plant decorations."

Laws and decrees proliferate.
Virtue states: *The Evolution of Rites* says: "When the Great Dao vanished, the world became a possession of households. Walls and moats were made for defense, and ritual and righteousness were used to govern. Thus, schemes arose, and warfare began." Laws and decrees proliferate, and bandits and thieves abound. *The Spring and Autumn Annals* says: "In Xia, disorderly governance led to the Penal Code of Yu; in Yin, to the Penal Code of Tang; in Zhou, to the Nine Punishments—all instruments of penal law belong to degenerate eras." The people are thus in chaos, escaping punishment without shame.

**Chapter 58: Governance in Obscurity**
Disaster leans upon fortune, and fortune hides within disaster.
Virtue states: Qi faced the crisis of Zhongsun and Duke Huan rose to power, ultimately dominating his state. Jin endured the turmoil of Li Ke and Duke Wen emerged, commanding the feudal lords—these two states flourished through disaster. When Wei was at peace, the Di destroyed it; when Xing was secure, Wei annihilated it—these two states perished without disaster. Thus, concealment and dependence have no end. *The Spring and Autumn Annals* says: "Some expand their territory through misfortune, while others lose their domains without calamity—it is unfathomable. Is there no principle to this?"

Virtue states: "One who cultivates virtue by rectifying conduct will not suffer even from the omen of a pheasant’s call. One who is at ease and free from care may lose a horse without considering it a disaster. Regret and misfortune have no fixed pattern—they are summoned by one’s own actions."

**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**
Governing people and serving Heaven.
*Subcommentary*: Abundant sacrificial grains.
Virtue states: In the sixth year of Duke Huan’s reign, *The Spring and Autumn Annals* records that King Wu of Chu invaded Sui. He sent his minister, Wei Zhang, to seek peace, stationing his army at Xia in Sui to await a response. The people of Sui sent Shaoshi to negotiate terms. Dou Bobi said to the King of Chu: "Our lack of success east of the Han is our own doing. We deployed our armies in five-three-two formations, clad in armor, and intimidated them with force—they were terrified. Yet they coordinated to scheme against us, making our task difficult. Among the states east of the Han, Sui is the largest. If Sui expands, it will abandon the smaller states, and their alienation will benefit Chu." Shaoshi was arrogant, so Dou Bobi proposed: "Let us feign weakness to embolden him." Xiong Lübi said: "Sui has the worthy minister Ji Liang—what use is this?" Dou Bobi replied: "For future planning." Ji Liang advised against it, but his counsel was heeded only once. Shaoshi had the ruler’s favor and carried out his own plan. The king disbanded the army to receive Shaoshi. Upon returning, Shaoshi urged the pursuit of Chu’s forces. The Marquis of Sui was about to agree when Ji Liang stopped him: "Heaven is granting favor to Chu. Their feigned weakness is a lure. Why rush?" He continued: "A small state can resist a large one when the small follows the Dao and the large is excessive. The Dao lies in loyalty to the people and trust in the spirits. Loyalty means prioritizing the people’s welfare; trust means the invocators and scribes speaking truthfully. Now the people hunger while the ruler indulges, and the invocators falsify offerings in sacrifice—I do not see how this can succeed." The Marquis of Sui said: "Our sacrificial animals are flawless and fat, our grains abundant—how can we lack trust?" Ji Liang replied: "The people are the masters of the spirits. Thus, sagely kings first ensured the people’s well-being before serving the spirits. When presenting sacrificial animals, they declared: 'Plump and fat,' signifying the people’s universal prosperity, the thriving and abundance of their livestock, their freedom from disease, and the completeness of their possessions. When offering grains, they declared: 'Pure and abundant,' signifying the three seasons passed without harm, the people’s harmony, and a bountiful harvest. When presenting sweet wine, they declared: 'Fine and excellent,' signifying that superiors and inferiors alike possessed virtuous conduct without deceit. This is what is meant by 'fragrant offerings free from slander.' They devoted themselves to the three seasons, cultivated the five teachings, and fostered kinship among the nine clans to perform their village sacrifices. Thus, the people were harmonious, and the spirits bestowed blessings, ensuring success in all undertakings. Now the people have divergent hearts, and the ghosts and spirits lack a master. Though you alone prosper, what blessing can there be? First rectify governance and strengthen ties with brotherly states—perhaps then you may avoid disaster." The Marquis of Sui, alarmed, reformed his governance, and Chu dared not attack.

The three seasons are spring plowing, summer planting, and autumn harvest—the three seasons of agriculture.

**Thrift**
*Annotation*: What gathers people is called wealth.
Virtue states: The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* says: "The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is life; the greatest treasure of the sage is position. How does one preserve position? Through benevolence. How does one gather people? Through wealth. Wealth is what sustains life." Thus, one can possess a state.

*Subcommentary*: The *Book of Changes* says: "The king reaches the temple and the household"—this is the meaning.
Virtue states: One who possesses a state governs where chariot tracks extend, where written script is shared, where people submit to his virtue and distant lands cherish his transformation—only then can it be called possessing a state. Some rule through military might or deceptive tactics, merely holding territory without the people’s submission. Others inherit a peaceful reign but, due to moral failings and insufficient virtue, do not deeply permeate the people with benevolence—these cannot be said to truly possess a state.

"The king reaches the temple and the household" refers to the *Cui* hexagram of the *Book of Changes*: "The king reaches the temple, offering filial piety." *Jia* means "to gather." The king gathers the people to the temple, and through the temple, he expresses filial devotion—thus it says, "It is beneficial to see the great person." Gathering is for rectification; observing what is gathered reveals the nature of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. When the world is fractured and divided, the people resent, and even with sacrifices, it is as if there were no temple. Only when the king achieves great unity and filial virtue prevails can it be called possessing a temple.

"The king reaches the household" refers to the *Jiaren* hexagram of the *Book of Changes*, where the ninth line of the fifth place states: "The king reaches the household—do not worry." The *Xiang* commentary says: "The king reaches the household—mutual love prevails." When the king embodies the Dao of the household, none below fail to be transformed by it. Once the world is transformed, the six relations live in harmony, hence it is called "mutual love." The *Huan* hexagram also speaks of "the king reaches the temple," its meaning being the same. This is the Dao of deep roots and firm stems, the Way of long life and enduring vision.

The *Yi* commentary states: When the ruler nurtures the people with virtue and power, governs the world with frugality, and amasses wealth, the state prospers. When virtue accumulates, the ancestral line flourishes. When near and far submit in heart, and the Hua and Rong alike yield in obedience, and when he can mother and nourish the myriad things while cherishing all living beings as children, then deep roots ensure an unbounded ancestral line, and firm stems guarantee the eternal extension of descendants. This is long life and enduring vision, the radiance of successive generations.

**Chapter Sixty: Governing a Great State**
"Only its own ghosts are efficacious; only its efficacious spirits do not harm the people."

The *Shu* commentary says: *The Spring and Autumn Annals* states, "Its *qi* flames forth to claim it."

The *Yi* commentary says: In the fourteenth year of Duke Zhuang’s reign in *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, Lord Li of Zheng, having fled to Li, invaded Zheng and reached Daling, where he captured the grandee Fu Xia. Fu Xia said, "If you agree to my terms, I will request to restore you to the throne." They swore an alliance, and he was pardoned. On the *jiazi* day of the sixth month, Fu Xia killed Prince Yi of Zheng and his two sons, restoring Lord Li. Earlier, Zheng had experienced an omen: an inner snake and an outer snake fought in the southern gate, and the inner snake died. Six years later, Lord Li reentered the state. The Duke, having heard of this, asked Shen Ru, "Are there still omens?" Shen Ru replied, "What people fear, its *qi* flames forth to claim. This is like fire: when the flame is not yet formed, it is the moment of advance and retreat—an analogy for the human heart not being firm and upright. Portents arise from human actions; without human transgression, portents do not arise on their own. When people abandon constancy, portents arise—hence the omen." After reentering, Lord Li killed Fu Xia and sent word to Yuan Fan, saying, "Fu Xia was disloyal. Zhou has fixed punishments, and he has already paid for his crime. Those who restored me without a divided heart, I will grant the rank of grandee. I wish to discuss this with you, uncle." He continued, "When I went into exile, you offered no counsel; upon my return, you did not think of me. Though the altars of the state had a lord, your heart was elsewhere—I hold this against you." Yuan Fan replied, "Our late lord, Duke Huan, commanded me, the lineage steward, to oversee the ancestral tablets and the sacred stones—the lords of the altars. Though the altars had a lord, my heart was elsewhere—how could I be disloyal? If one truly presides over the altars, who among the people within the state would not be a subject? To have no divided heart is Heaven’s decree. Prince Yi held the throne for fourteen years, yet those who plotted to recall you—were they not disloyal? Duke Zhuang had eight sons; if all were granted ranks, passersby would be encouraged to disloyalty. How could affairs be settled? You may do as you wish." He then received the command and hanged himself. When neither side harms the other, virtue and power converge in mutual return.

The *Shu* commentary says: People are the hosts of the spirits.

The *Yi* commentary says: In the nineteenth year of Duke Xi’s reign in *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Huan of Song sent Duke Wen of Zhu to sacrifice Prince Zi of Zeng at the altar of the *Ci* River’s spirit. Marshal Zi Yu said, "In ancient times, the six domestic animals were not used interchangeably in sacrifices. Minor affairs did not employ great sacrifices—how much less dare one use humans? Sacrifices are for the sake of people. People are the hosts of the spirits; if humans are used, who will receive the offerings? When Duke Huan of Qi preserved three perishing states, he bound them to the feudal lords. Righteous men still called this meager virtue. Now, in a single assembly, you have oppressed the lords of two states"—referring to the seizure of the Prince of Teng and the sacrifice of the Prince of Zeng—"and you employ them for licentious and benighted ghosts. How can you seek hegemony? It would be fortunate to escape ruin—I fear the state will perish." Zi Yu was Duke Gongzi Mu Yi of Song. The Sui River flows from the Bian into the Si, where there was a malevolent spirit. The Eastern Yi sacrificed humans to it. "The six domestic animals were not used interchangeably" means, for example, that one could not use a horse in sacrifices to the Horse Ancestor—how much less a human? Now, when the sage nurtures the people with the Dao, ghosts and spirits bestow blessings, and neither side harms the other. This may be called profound virtue.

**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great State as the Lower Reaches**
The *Yi* commentary says: In the thirtieth year of Duke Zhao’s reign in *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, You Ji of Zheng said to Shi Jingbo, a grandee of Jin, "When a small state serves a great one, it lies in reverently awaiting its commands. When a great state cherishes a small one, it lies in aiding what it lacks—this was the system of the former kings. To take precautions is all that is needed to maintain good relations." This is why a great state must urgently practice humility—it does not lie in using its greatness to control the small.

Thus, when a great state lowers itself to a small state, it wins the small state.

The *Yi* commentary says: In the fourteenth year of Duke Xiang’s reign in *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, a great state’s ability to pacify a small one is seen in how Jin, as the leader of the covenant, dealt with Wei, which had expelled its ruler and enthroned Prince Piao. Jin wished to punish its crime. The Marquis of Jin asked Zhonghang Xianzi for his opinion. Yan replied, "It would be better to stabilize it by following the situation. Attacking it may not achieve our aim and would only trouble the feudal lords." Historian Yi had said, "Follow its weightiness and pacify it." Zhong Hui had said, "Rescue the perishing and take the disordered; push away the perishing and secure the existing—this is the state’s Dao." The Marquis said, "Stabilize Wei and await the right moment." In winter, they assembled at Qi to deliberate on Wei. This is what is meant by a great state pacifying a small state.

As for a great state gathering small states, this refers to the myriad regions paying court and assembling without cease. Thus, the Xia founder Qi held the feast at Juntai (in Henan), the Shang founder Tang issued the decree at Jingbo (in Yanshi), the Zhou founder Wu swore the oath at Mengjin, King Cheng held the review at Qiyang, King Kang convened the court at Fenggong (in Huodu), King Mu assembled at Tushan (in Shouchun), Duke Huan of Qi led the campaign at Shaoling, and Duke Wen of Jin formed the covenant at Jiantu. In all these cases, the great states cherished those below, and the small states served those above—each found its proper place.

A great state that fails to nurture small states is exemplified in the seventeenth year of Duke Wen’s reign, when the Marquis of Jin could not cherish and foster the feudal lords but instead imposed harsh commands upon Zheng. Zijia of Zheng wrote to Zhao Xuanzi, saying: "The ancients had a saying, 'Fear the head, fear the tail—how much remains of the body?' They also said, 'A dying deer does not choose its cry.' When a small state serves a great state, if the great state possesses virtue, the small state becomes its people; if it lacks virtue, the small state becomes its deer. Pressed to the point of running risks, how can it choose? This means that if Jin imposes cruel commands upon Zheng, Zheng will seek refuge with Chu. If commands are without limit, it knows it will perish. It will exhaust its resources to await the arrival of Xiushu at Jin’s borders. Situated between great states and subjected to coercion, is this its fault? This arises from a great state’s failure to nurture and embrace the small, leading to their rebellion. Thus, a great state must humble itself and adopt a gentle, tranquil demeanor to win over small states. The term *qu* (取) means 'to gather,' that is, to gather others to oneself. When a small state submits to a great state, it gains the great state’s favor."

The *Commentary* states: "If a small state fails to offer utmost courtesy and sincerity in serving a great state," as in the twenty-first year of Duke Xi’s reign, when the people of Song formed the Covenant of Lushang to seek the allegiance of the feudal lords from Chu. Chu agreed, but Gongzi Muyi of Song said: "For a small state to contend for alliances is disaster. Is Song doomed? Fortunately, it suffered defeat later." When the covenant was made, Muyi said: "The disaster lies here. The ruler’s desires are excessive—how can he endure?" Thereupon, Chu seized the Duke of Song and attacked Song. In winter, they convened at Bo and released him. Muyi said: "The disaster arose from haste. It was not enough to admonish the ruler." This is an example of a small state’s failure to serve a great state.

When a small state successfully serves a great state, as in the first year of Duke Yin’s reign, when Yifu of Zhu formed an alliance at Mie (a territory of Lu), Zhu, though a dependent state, had not yet received the king’s mandate, so the *Spring and Autumn Annals* recorded his name. Yet as a small state, it was able to engage with a great state, maintain good relations, and bring peace to the people. The *Annals* honored it by recording its courtesy name—this is the proper way.

As for *chaoping* (朝聘): when a great state visits a small state, it is called *ping* (聘), for the great serves the small; when a small state visits a great state, it is called *chao* (朝), for the small serves the great. *Jihao* (继好) means to establish trust. Planning affairs and remedying deficiencies—this is the essence of ritual. Mencius said: "Only the humane can serve the small with the great," as when Tang served the Earl of Ge or King Wen served the Kun barbarians. "Only the wise can serve the great with the small," as when King Tai served the Xunyu or Goujian served Wu. Serving the small with the great is called "rejoicing in Heaven"; serving the great with the small is called "revering Heaven." Those who rejoice in Heaven preserve all under Heaven; those who revere Heaven preserve their state. The *Book of Songs* says: "Revere the majesty of Heaven, and thus preserve it in due time." This verse from the *Zhou Hymns* praises King Cheng for revering Heaven’s majesty and securing great peace.

Thus, some humble themselves to gain, while others gain by humbling themselves.

The *Commentary* states: The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says, "An army that can be directed left or right." The *Exegesis* explains: In the autumn of the twenty-sixth year of Duke Xi, Song rebelled against Chu and allied with Jin. Chu’s Chief Minister Ziyu and Marshal Zixi led forces to attack Song, besieging Jin. The Duke, with Chu’s army, attacked Qi and seized Gu. An army that can be directed left or right is said to act *yi* (以), meaning its advance or retreat is at its own discretion. The Duke placed Duke Huan’s son Yong in Gu as an ally for Lu. Shen Shuhou of Chu garrisoned it. Duke Huan had seven sons, who became seven grandees in Chu—this was because Duke Xiao of Qi could not nurture them. In the twenty-eighth year, the Viscount of Chu sent Shen Shu to withdraw from Gu. This illustrates that control lies with oneself, while taking or relinquishing depends on the times.

A great state desires nothing more than to care for others, while a small state desires nothing more than to serve others. The *Exegesis* states: When a small state seeks a great state’s aid, as in the autumn of the fourteenth year of Duke Wen, when the Earl of Zheng feasted with the Duke of Lu at Fei, Guisheng Zijia of Zheng recited the *Hongyan* ode, invoking its meaning of compassion for the widowed and orphaned, urging the Duke of Lu to show mercy. He also recited the fourth stanza of *Zaichi*, saying that Zheng, as a small and weak state in distress, sought to draw a great state’s support—this is the proper way. When both parties attain their desires, the greater should act with humility.

The *Exegesis* states: If a great state fails to act with humility, gathering others with arrogance and displaying excess, people will surely abandon it. Jie of Xia convened the assembly at Youreng, and the people rebelled. Zhou of Shang held the review at Li, and the Dongyi barbarians revolted. King You of Zhou formed the covenant at Taishi, and the Rong and Yi tribes rebelled. Duke Xiang of Song held the assembly at Lushang, and the feudal lords deserted him. The Viscount of Chu convened at Shen, and the people’s hearts turned away. If one does not embrace with virtue or pacify with ritual, each person will follow their own heart—how can they be subdued?

**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Mystery of the Myriad Things**
The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things.

The *Commentary* cites the *Scripture of Western Ascent*. The *Exegesis* explains: The *Scripture of Western Ascent* was transmitted when Lord Lao, in the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao of Zhou (a *guichou* year), the fourth month, at the northern foot of Mount Zhongnan, within the thatched tower of Yin Xi, bestowed the two scriptures of the *Dao* and *Virtue*. Afterward, wishing to transform the Western Lands beyond the sands, Yin Xi inquired about the method of preserving the Three Ones and the essentials of cultivating the Dao and refining the body. Later, he compiled the sage’s words into the *Scripture of Western Ascent*, which conveys the meaning of ascending to the Great Subtlety and transforming the Western Lands. The *Scripture* comprises thirty-six chapters, 972 lines, and 4,278 characters. Its purport aligns with the *Scripture of the Dao and Virtue*, expounding the profound mystery of the Great Dao as the abyss of emptiness and nonbeing.

Thus, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Dukes are appointed.

The *Exegesis* states: The vastness of the four seas and the abundance of the myriad things—at the dawn of humanity, there could be no lordless realm. Thus, the Son of Heaven was established to govern them. The Son of Heaven reveres the Supreme Emperor, serves Heaven as a father, and serves Earth as a mother—he is called the Son of Heaven.

One person cannot govern broadly alone; thus, the hundred officials are appointed to oversee them, with the Three Dukes as their leaders. The *Missing Chapter on the Offices of Zhou* in the *Book of Documents* states: "Only the Three Dukes deliberate on the Dao and manage the state."

The Grand Preceptor possesses wisdom deep as a wellspring and conduct worthy of emulation. When consulted, he responds; when sought, he provides—thus he is called the Grand Preceptor, also known as the Venerated Father. "Grand" signifies greatness, for he serves as the king’s teacher. He rides in a secure carriage with a cyan canopy and bears a golden seal with purple ribbons.

The Grand Mentor is tasked with instruction and safeguarding. The *Rites of the Elder Dai* states: "He instills virtue and righteousness in the Son of Heaven." If the Son of Heaven shows no kindness to his parents, no benevolence to the common people, no propriety toward his ministers, or no impartiality in legal judgments, these are failures of the Grand Mentor’s duty.

The Grand Guardian serves as support and responsibility. The *Rites of the Elder Dai* states: "If the Son of Heaven sits improperly, receives documents irreverently, speaks out of order, sings off-key, or fails in the rituals of ascent, descent, bowing, and yielding, these are failures of the Grand Guardian’s duty."

Additionally, the Three Dukes—Grand Commandant, Minister of Education, and Minister of Works—assist the Son of Heaven in harmonizing yin and yang, caring for the people, and spreading moral instruction; these are their duties.

Heaven’s work is carried out by humans as its agents. The *Counsels of Gao Yao* in the *Book of Documents* states: "Day after day, the myriad affairs must not be neglected by the officials. Heaven’s work is carried out by humans as its agents." "Neglect" means vacancy; "myriad" means multitude. Those who occupy these positions must be the right persons; if not, the posts remain vacant. This means that humans act on Heaven’s behalf in governing offices and must not treat Heaven’s offices as private domains by appointing the unfit.

"Though one may offer a large jade disc before a team of four horses..."
*Annotation*: As in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, where cases like presenting four leather hides before twelve oxen to reward an army are recorded.
*Exegesis*: In the thirty-third year of Duke Xi in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, when the Jin army attacked Zheng and reached Hua, Zheng’s merchant Xian Gao, traveling to trade in Zhou, encountered them. He presented four leather hides and twelve oxen to reward the army, saying: "Our humble lord has heard that you, sirs, are marching against our state and ventures to offer this sustenance to your followers. Though our tribute is meager, for those who tarry, it provides a day’s provisions; for those who march, it secures a night’s defense. I have also sent a swift messenger to inform Zheng, that it may prepare." *(The following line, "Its ease and simplicity are upheld," from Chapter Sixty-Four of the* Scripture of the Dao and Virtue*, is unrelated and thus omitted.)*

**Exegesis:** The term "external" refers to pearls, rhinoceros horns, and precious treasures.

**Exposition:** Pearls may reach a diameter of an inch, their radiance illuminating twelve chariots—such were the treasures prized by the ancients. Rhinoceroses, found beyond the southern frontier, are oxen weighing over a thousand *jin*, with a single horn at the tip of their snouts, which may be fashioned into treasures. When split, their horns reveal veins that form distinct patterns. Some repel dust, others water; when ground and ingested, they cure ailments caused by *gu* toxins, and chickens, upon seeing them at night, take fright—hence the name "chicken-startler." Rhinoceros horns, too, have been esteemed since antiquity. Gold, jade, rare curiosities, plants, trees, fur, and feathers—whatever is wondrous and highly valued—are all called treasures.

Cowries emerge from the Eastern Sea, resembling conches with markings; some grow to a length of a *chi* and may be wrought into treasures. In the sea, they are shelled creatures; on land, they are called *biao*; in water, *han*. In ancient times, cowries were used as currency alongside prized tortoiseshells. The Zhou dynasty had coinage and cowries, but by the Qin, cowries were abolished in favor of coinage. The character for cowrie (*bei*) is pictographic. Today, all terms related to wealth, gifts, tributes, rewards, and valuables derive from the radical *bei*.

An ancient poem states: *"He who hoards wealth is a fool, for riches burden virtue."* In antiquity, there were three forms of currency: pearls and jade as the highest, gold as the middle, and knife-shaped coins and cloth money as the lowest. Emperors used these to govern the Four Seas.

**Chapter Sixty-Five: "Those of Old Who Excelled in the Dao"**
*"Not governing the state with cunning is the state’s blessing."*
**Annotation:** *"Reclining in ease, flourishing in tranquility; juggling spheres to resolve peril."*

**Exposition:** *"Reclining in ease, flourishing in tranquility"* refers to Duan Ganmu, who served as mentor to Marquis Wen of Wei. Prioritizing stillness and moral transformation, he brought about a state of repose and security, thus fortifying the state of Wei. *"Reclining"* denotes lying at ease; *"ease"* means rest. *"Flourishing"* signifies a protective barrier.

*"Juggling spheres to resolve peril"* recounts how Bai Gongsheng of Chu and Minister Zixi raised armies against each other. Their retainers remarked: "Shinan Yiliao is a man of hidden depth, a match for five hundred warriors." Both factions dispatched envoys to summon him. Yiliao, however, remained supine, juggling two spheres in his hands without dropping them, even as he balanced a sword without flinching. The envoys returned and described his demeanor. The two lords concluded: *"His supine repose signals non-action; his unmoving sword suggests that arms are unreliable. The two hands represent our two houses; the spheres, round and passive, symbolize non-interference. His ceaseless juggling foretells mutual ruin if we persist in war."* Thus, the two lords disbanded their forces and returned home, resolving the crisis. This account appears in the *Zhuangzi*.

*"Profound virtue, profound indeed and far-reaching, returning to things, only then is there great compliance."*

**Exposition:** *"Great compliance"* is rooted in human nature. The *"Liyun"* chapter of the *Book of Rites* states: *"Human nature is the field of the sage-kings."* Thus, sage-kings cultivate the handle of righteousness and the order of ritual to govern human nature. Treating nature as a field, they till it with ritual to harmonize hardness and softness. They sow it with righteousness to plant the seeds of goodness. They weed it with study to preserve truth and discard falsehood. They gather its harvest through humaneness to consolidate its fruits. They soothe it with music to inspire steadfastness. Governing a state without ritual is like plowing without a plowshare. Practicing ritual without grounding it in righteousness is like plowing without sowing. Upholding righteousness without studying it is like sowing without weeding. Studying without uniting it with the seven virtues is like weeding without reaping. Uniting it with humaneness without soothing it with music is like reaping without eating. Soothing it with music without achieving compliance is like eating without growing robust.

The body’s robustness lies in the comfort of the four limbs and the fullness of skin and flesh. A family’s robustness lies in the closeness of father and son, the harmony of brothers, and the accord of husband and wife. A state’s robustness lies in the integrity of high ministers, the incorruptibility of petty officials, the proper order of offices, and the rectitude of ruler and minister. The world’s robustness lies in the Son of Heaven governing with virtue as his chariot and music as his reins, feudal lords interacting through ritual, ministers ordering themselves through law, scholars examining one another through trust, and the common people maintaining harmony. This is called *"great compliance."*

Thus, when the Son of Heaven employs the people in accordance with compliance, Heaven does not withhold its Dao, Earth does not withhold its treasures, and people do not withhold their nature. Auspicious omens emerge—these are the treasures of compliance.

**Chapter Sixty-Nine: "Those Who Use Arms Have a Saying"**
*"No arms."*

Here follows the translation:

---

It is said: The arrows of *She’e* and *Jiādòu*, the bows of *Wūhào* and *Fánruò*, the blades of *Yúcháng* and *Kūnwú*, the swords of *Tài’ē* and *Jùquè*, the Wu hooks and Chu spears, the Shu crossbows and *Mèngláo*—though one may grasp and wield them, they serve no purpose. The "Five Weapons" refer to the dagger-axe, spear, *shū*, halberd, and shield, signifying five distinct types.

In the *Rites of Zhou*, the *Lú* official crafts encampment tools, and if a weapon’s haft exceeds three [times its blade], the wielder cannot use it. *Bì* means haft. The haft of a dagger-axe is six *chǐ* and six *cùn* long; the *shū* is one *xún* and four *chǐ* (a *xún* being eight *chǐ*, thus one *zhàng* and two *chǐ*). The standard spear is four *chǐ* long, while the *yí* spear spans three *xún* (*yí* meaning "long," thus two *zhàng* and four *chǐ*). On open plains, weapons should be long; in mountains and forests, short. The grip should be sharp, the armor sturdy.

Weapons include drums and horns, metal and leather, tusked banners, axes and halberds, armor and helmets, pennants and streamers, bows and crossbows, and curved bows with arrows—each with its own system, broadly categorized into five ranks. The *Shuowen* states: "To clasp hands and wield an axe is called *bīng* (weapon)." Nothing is greater than underestimating the enemy.

It is said: The Dao of using arms begins with an enemy state before you—first strike at its plans, then assess its strength. When courage and cowardice are matched, and numbers are equal, one must still seize Heaven’s timing, borrow Earth’s advantages, weigh the right and wrong of the situation, and rely on the people’s unity. Or, by raising high ramparts and deep moats, one may blunt Zhuge Liang’s keen edge; by burning boats to show resolve, one may wipe away the former shame of Qin’s folly. A falling star may herald an end, a sealed coffin may return to the state. If not, then five thousand troops may march deep only to mourn forever at Yan’s frontier and Long’s dunes; a million may rampage, only to flee in terror at the cry of wind and crane. On Jin’s mountains, grass and trees may take human form; at Kunyang, rhinos and elephants may serve our cause. Yet the treasure of humility and compassion is lost thereby.

Thus, when armies clash, the grieving side prevails.

It is said: Though Rong and Di invade the frontier, jackals and wolves harm the state, traitors and villains wreak havoc, and rebels disrupt order, when one must roll up sleeves and command troops, carve gates to issue laws, and lead the people to eliminate harm—even then, forced to wage war, one fears that strength may defy benevolence. Thus, grief and compassion align with the Dao.

**Chapter Seventy-Six: "The Life of the People"**
*"When wood is stiff, it is felled."*

It is said: Wood, with its thick base below, is naturally firm, but if the tip exceeds the root, it is no longer fitting. The proverb says: "A tail too large cannot wag"—a warning for the state. The Zhao clan thereby toppled Jin; the Tian clan thereby replaced Qi. Zizhi sowed doubt in Yan; Taishu was defeated in Zheng. Was this not because the tip exceeded the root, the minister outstripped the ruler? Such a principle is not compliant.

"Clasping hands" is called *gǒng*. Formerly, mulberry and catalpa sprouted in the Yin court, growing to a *gǒng* in seven days. When Duke Mu of Qin raged at Jianshu, the trees on his tomb had grown to a *gǒng*—all instances of *gǒng*.

**Chapter Seventy-Eight: "The Softness of the World"**
*"Nothing in the world is softer than water."*

It is said: In its use, water’s body is supremely soft, its nature ever yielding. A thousand rivers pour into it; a hundred valleys pay homage. It ascends as mist and dew, piercing the void; it threads the turning heavens, rising to the Milky Way. Speaking of its vastness, since ancient times it has filled the seas without overflowing. Speaking of its subtlety, even the tip of a hair receives its moisture.

Thus, the Old Master likened it to the Dao. The Three Powers do not refuse it; the Seven Virtues are fully encompassed. It embraces creation, permeates form and omen, dwells in turbidity and filth, adapts to square and circle—this is its supreme softness. Thus, nothing can harm it. Yet when it floods the Ten Continents, floats the Eight Extremes, engulfs sun and moon, and cradles Heaven and Earth, mountains and valleys shift at its will; the *kūn* and *péng* transform by its power. It shatters mountains and bores through stone—nothing is beyond its might. Thus, nothing can restrain it. This is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain.

It is said: The altars of soil and grain are established by the Son of Heaven when founding a state, with the ancestral temple to the left and the altars of soil and grain to the right, thereby becoming king. The ancestral temple is the place to honor ancestors and match Heaven. The altars of soil and grain honor agriculture, prepare sacrificial grains, and serve as the foundation of the people’s sustenance.

*Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Virtue by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Scroll Four* concludes.
