**Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic with Annotations**
**Title:** *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic with Annotations*

**Preface to the Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic with Annotations**
*Composed by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty*

In days of old, the Primordial Sage
Forcefully expounded the Mysterious Teachings.
The *Daodejing*’s true essence and sacred principles
Illuminated all subsequent generations.

Though his writings remain authentic,
Their profound meaning often diverges.
Condensing his core intent,
Even the strict *Shu Yan* [注: *Shu Yan* refers to the *Shu Yan Dao/Way Classic*, a commentary by Ge Hong (葛洪) of the Jin Dynasty] still falls short.
Extracting his verses and phrases,
The *He Gong* [注: *He Gong*, or *He Gong Dao/Way Classic*, a commentary by He Yan (何晏) of the Wei-Jin period] and others omit too much.

The rest is but faint traces—
Hardly worth mentioning—
Yet the Dao/Way’s wondrous intent of the Primordial Sage
Would surely be lost if neglected.

I am indeed limited in understanding,
Yet I have often felt the joy of preserving this sacred text,
Fearful of losing the principle of *Wu Wei* [注: *Wu Wei*, non-action, a key Daoist concept].
On occasions of solemn repose,
I would knock upon the Mysterious Gate,
And as my insights unfolded,
I penned annotations and elucidations.

This is not meant to establish a singular doctrine,
But merely to supplement the gaps in its transmission.

Now, as I lay down my brush,
I ask the assembled ministers, officials, and scholars of Dao/Way and Buddhist teachings:
If any can arise like the *Bo Shang* [注: *Bo Shang*, or *Bo Shang Dao/Way Classic*, attributed to Laozi’s disciple Bo Yi (伯夷)],
Or heal ailments like *Zuo Shi* [注: *Zuo Shi*, likely referring to the *Zuo Tradition* (左氏), a commentary style associated with Zuo Qiuming (左丘明)],
Or quench their thirst for virtue by accepting my words,
I would humbly welcome their counsel.
If they fulfill this request,
I shall bestow rich rewards.

As for flatterers who claim to be sages,
I hope they are not of this kind,
Nor those who boast like merchants of the marketplace—
Such petty ways are beneath them.

Since they dare not conceal the truth,
Let them speak frankly,
Lest later generations scorn them,
And weigh down my own lack of virtue.

*—Composed by the Daoist Immortal Zuo Xian Gong [注: *Zuo Xian Gong* Ge Xuan (葛玄), a Daoist sage of the Han-Jin period]*

The Daoist Sage, naturally born of the Way,
Emerges before the **Great Void** (太无),
Arises from no cause,
Traverses heaven and earth,
Ends without beginning or end,
Exhausts without bound or extremity,
And thus is **Limitless** (无极).
He aligns with the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) in harmony,
Stands as the root of heaven and earth,
Disperses **qi** (气) in all ten directions,
Embraces the purest **virtue/power** (德) of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (道德),
Vast and boundless—
Beyond all naming.

His brilliance shines with **scripture** (文章),
His majesty is grand in its fulfillment,
His depth cannot be measured,
His splendor is the ancestor of all **divine mysteries** (神明).
The Three Lights (三光) hold him to illuminate,
Heaven and earth draw life from him,
The **Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branches** (乾坤) move to emit their essence.

Lofty yet without subjects,
Noble yet without rank,
Covering all without end—
He instructs the eight **celestial directions** (八方诸天),
Ever propagating the **Great Dao/Way** (大道),
Before the opening of creation and descending as **National Teacher** (国师),
Unbroken through generations,
No one knows his origin.

He crafts all things,
Yet never claims credit for his **mysterious virtue/power** (玄之德),
Thus all sages revere him in common.

**Dao/Way** is honored, **virtue/power** (德) is noble,
Yet none commands it—
It endures naturally.
Only the Sage Laozi!

In the Zhou era, he was entrusted to the divine **Li Mother** (李母),
Born from her left flank,
Emerging with radiant clarity,
And named **Laozi** (老子).
His title **Laozi** comes from **Limitless** (玄),
Before heaven and earth,
Free from decay or aging,
Thus called **Laozi**.

The world supposes Laozi began in the Zhou,
But his title **Laozi** began in countless **kalpas** (劫),
Most distant and profound beyond measure.

When the **Great Dao/Way** declined and faded,
He wandered westward through the world,
And **Guān Order** (关令) Yin Xi (尹喜) said:
“The **Great Dao/Way** is about to vanish!
I beg you to record it for me.”

Thus he composed *The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* (道德) in two sections of five thousand words,
Spanning the **Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branches** (上下经).
The five thousand words proclaim the source of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (道德),
All-encompassing in the grand,
All-inclusive in the minute—
The natural **scripture** (经) of heaven and humanity.

My former master said:
To study it with earnest devotion,
Then its resonance harmonizes with the **Great Ultimate** (太极),
Ascending far and singing beyond,
All **celestial beings** (诸天) rejoice,
And one attains the **mysterious sage** (契玄人).
To ponder it in stillness,
Then all marvels gather in response.
To observe inwardly one’s form and shadow,
Then **spirit-qi** (神气) endures eternally.
To embody **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (道德),
Then all **spirits** (万神) submit in awe,
Disaster vanishes from the **Nine Shades** (九阴),
Blessings arise in all ten directions,
Nations and families find peace—
Who can comprehend this?

The **scripture** of **non-action** (无为),
When **simplified** (垮) does not disgrace,
When **elaborated** (饰) does not bring honor,
When **extended** (桡) does not become murky,
When **clarified** (澄) does not become clear—
All is **naturally** (自然).
To manifest in accordance with the **Dao/Way** (道),
To transmit without end—
This is the **constant** (常),
Thus knowing the **constant** is called **enlightenment** (明).
What need does the **Great Dao/Way** have?

To propagate depends on humanity,
This **scripture** (斯文) is noble and wondrous—
How could one not refine it to its utmost?

A rough exposition remains,
Yet only the **Daoist** (有道者) treasures it.

**River Above Master** (河上公)—
No one knows his name.

In the time of Emperor **Xiao Wen** (孝文) of the Han,
He constructed a thatched hut by the river’s edge,
Often reading Laozi’s *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic* (道德经).
The emperor loved Laozi’s words,
And decreed that all **princes, ministers, and officials** (诸王公大臣州牧二千石),
As well as all **courtiers** (朝直众官),
Should recite it.

There were several passages he did not understand,
And none in the world could fully explain them—
Until he heard that **River Above Master** (河上公) recited Laozi’s text.
The emperor sent **Chao Shi** (韶使) with the unclear passages to question him.

**River Above Master** said:
“The **Dao/Way** is honored, **virtue/power** (德) is noble—
It is not something one can ask about from afar.”

The emperor immediately descended from his carriage
And bowed in reverence before him.
The emperor said:
“Under the heavens, there is none who is not my subject.
At the bounds of the earth, there is none who is not my minister.
Within my realm, there are four **Great Ones** (四大),
And I am one of them.
Though you possess the **Dao/Way** (道),
You are still my subject.
If you cannot humble yourself,
Why do you claim such loftiness?
I alone can confer wealth and nobility or poverty and lowliness.”

After a moment,
**River Above Master** lowered his hands,
Sat and leapt into the void,
Ascending like rising clouds,
A hundred *zhang* (丈) above the earth,
In **Limitless** (玄虚) silence for a long time,
Then descended and answered the emperor:
“My being does not reach heaven,
Nor does it entangle with humanity,
Nor does it dwell upon the earth—
What subject could I be?
Your Majesty cannot command me to be wealthy or noble, or poor or lowly.”

The emperor then realized he was a **divine being** (神人),
And immediately alighted from his carriage,
Knelt in homage, and bowed in thanks.
He said:
“Though I am unworthy,
I have inherited the imperial legacy,
My ability is insufficient for greatness,
And I fear I cannot bear the weight.
Though I govern worldly affairs,
My heart reveres **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (道德),
Yet my understanding is dim,
And many things remain unclear.
If you, the **Daoist Sovereign** (道君), would graciously enlighten me,
Then even in the darkest night I shall behold the radiance of the **Great Ultimate** (太阳之耀光).”

**River Above Master** then bestowed the plain **scripture** (素书)
Of Laozi’s *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic* (道德经章句),
Two volumes in total,
And said to the emperor:
“Study this thoroughly,
And your doubts shall dissolve.
Since my annotations of this **scripture** (经),
It has been seventeen hundred years,
And passed through three generations—
Now four with you.
Do not reveal it to those unworthy.”

The emperor knelt to receive the **scripture** (经),
And when he finished speaking,
**River Above Master** had vanished.

Scholars say the emperor loved the **Great Dao/Way** (大道),
Yet the people could not fully grasp its meaning,
And through profound reflection and distant resonance,
They revered the **Supreme Daoist Sovereign** (太上道君),
Sending a **divine being** (神人) to descend and teach them—
Then departed immediately.
Perhaps the emperor’s faith was not yet pure,
So **River Above Master** displayed divine transformations
To awaken his resolve,
Desiring to establish the truth of the **Dao/Way**.
Thus, the people named him **River Above Master**.

Laozi, in the year **Shang Huang** (上皇) of the first cycle,
On the twelfth day of the first month,
When the **Great Void** (太岁) was **Ding Mao** (丁卯),
Descended as **Zhou Teacher** (周师).
In the year **Wu Ji** (无极),
When the **Great Void** (太岁) was **Gui Chou** (癸丑),
On the fifth month, **Ren Wu** (壬午),
He departed from Zhou and crossed the **Pass** (关).

**Guān Order** (关令) Yin Xi (尹喜),
By **predestined harmony** (宿命合道),
Had foreseen the **purple clouds** (紫云) moving westward,
And knew a **Daoist** (道人) would pass through.
He kept vigil, purified himself, and burned incense,
Aspiring to behold the **Daoist Truth** (道真),
And on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month,
Laozi crossed the **Pass**.

Yin Xi saw Laozi.
The **Daoist** (子) welcomed him and arranged the rites,
Calling him **disciple** (弟子).
Laozi said:
“You were destined for this.
You shall benefit the world,
Abandoning the **accomplished** (贤) to transmit the **Great Dao/Way** (大道),
You are a **divine immortal** (神仙者矣).”

On the twenty-eighth day,
He imparted the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic* (太上道德经),
Its meaning piercing **Limitless** (虚无),
All-encompassing in the grand,
All-inclusive in the minute—
Even **sage-kings** (圣王) cannot fully grasp its meaning.

In ancient times, the Han Emperor Wen, fond of the **Dao/Way** of Laozi, stood in the **Non-Action Hall** (无为之堂), sighing that neither sages nor common folk could fathom its profound mysteries. Through profound contemplation and distant resonance, he ascended to the **Supreme Dao/Way Lord** (太上道君), who sent a **divine emissary** (神人) to impart subtle intentions to the Emperor. The **Daoist** (道人) then took a solemn oath and transmitted them. The **Perfect Ones** (至人) verified and cross-examined the text, for the **external Confucian scholars** (外儒) had introduced many errors in their transmissions. Now, we must compare and correct it, aligning it with the **Mystic Cavern** (玄洞).

The ten-directional **celestial beings, humans, immortals, and gods**, as well as the **heavenly and earthly spirits**, all revere and follow it—its essence is identical without variation.

I have already cross-verified this with the **divine kings of the heavens and immortals**, receiving transmission from the **celestial and human** realms. The **noble scholars and virtuous Confucians** must now uphold the **ultimate truth**, expounding the **Great Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**—how could they not be meticulous? Those who attain the **sage’s original text**—how could they not?

I speak thus to rectify the **mystic subtleties** before heaven, earth, and humankind.

Now, the teaching is complete and clear. Those who study the **Dao of Immortality** must surely expound its profound and esoteric truths.

The **Daoist Zheng Siyuan** (郑思远) said: My master, **Ge Xiansheng** (葛仙公), received the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic* (《道德经》) in two volumes—**Supreme Ultimate Truth** (太极真人) and **Xu Laile** (徐来勒). My master once cherished this text as if he had seen the **True Person** himself, teaching oral precepts, saying: *"This is the ancestral root of the Dao/Way."* To recite and savor it ten thousand times, to quiet the mind and focus on the **Mystic**—all shall surely ascend to immortality.

Hold this book in utmost reverence, worshipping it morning and evening, with devotions as precise as the **Lingbao Laws** (灵宝法). **Aspiring Daoists** should promote it thus.

My master always kept these words secret, transmitting them only to those with **immortal potential**.

**Composed by Wang Fu** (王雩):

In the age when Laozi transformed **Dao/Way and Virtue/Power** teachings, he wrote ninety-nine chapters to illuminate the principle of **generative vitality** (生生之理). Yet in later ages, scholars were obscured by the remnants of past traditions and confused by the divergent theories of the **Hundred Schools**. Their wisdom was insufficient to discern truth from falsehood, so they compared the **sage’s scriptures** with the writings of **Yang Zhu and Mozi**. Though many read them, few penetrated their depths.

Some even spoke loftily, drifting further from principle. Today’s transmitted commentaries—those of **Wang Bi** and **Zhang Yue**—contain many textual errors, each with merits and flaws, harming the true meaning in countless ways. Now, I compare and correct them, establishing what is most accurate, and explain each phrase based on what I have heard.

The **sage’s words** are already difficult to exhaust, yet even what we grasp in knowledge falls short in expression. If readers infer the intent from their own understanding, then my elucidations have already surpassed half the meaning.

This text was completed on the twelfth day of the seventh month, **Xining the Third Year** (熙宁三年).

I have often argued: Though sages may be many, their **Dao/Way** is one. Their **manifestations** follow one another, transcending the cosmos yet existing simultaneously. Their **residences** may differ as heaven and earth, yet they dwell together. Thus, their words are like the head and tail of a single entity—anything outside this **Dao/Way** is heresy.

Yet though the **Dao/Way is one**, its expressions differ; though expressions may align, the **Dao/Way** itself need not. Worldly scholars, recognizing only the words, deem identical expressions as correct; unaware of the **Dao/Way**, they reject its unity as false.

The *Classic of Changes* says: *"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao/Way."*
Laozi says: *"Having known the mother, one may know the child."*

If this is truly understood, then examining the **Five Phases** in their distinctions, observing the **Four Seasons** in their transformations, studying form and measuring intent—thus comparing all things—then even if the sage does not speak, I shall know it.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** is the **year**; the **sage** is the **season**. From **Emperor Yao and Shun** to **Confucius**, rituals and music were refined, embodied in **forms, names, measurements, and numbers**, while the **spirit’s operations** shone clearly in their creations. They established **hierarchies**, distinguished **virtue and mediocrity**, and governed the world—detailed in affairs, vast in scope—truly flourishing.

This was the **Summer** in its time. But Summer reverses into **Autumn**, which gathers the scattered and unifies it, sheds its blooms to bear fruit, distinguishing **things by virtue** and restoring **nature as constant**. Its intent is still, its deeds simple—yet Autumn does not seek to reverse Summer. Rather, it completes the **year** and generates **life**.

At this time, more than half of all **living things** perish—yet is this the **ultimate decree of heaven**, beyond the grasp of lesser wisdom? Autumn is not the end of the year, for there is yet a greater stage: thus, the **Four Seasons’ transformations**, when applied to us, are **youth, maturity, old age, and death**.

The classics say: *"To follow this throughout one’s life yet not know its Dao/Way—is this not the case?"*

Alas! To study the **Dao/Way** without expecting the discourse of **death**—then what is the point of study? *"Morning hearing of the Dao/Way, evening death—this is acceptable."* Thus, the **Dao/Way** is precious because it governs **life and death**. If one truly knows the **sincere virtue/power** and approaches its destination, then the discourse of **death and life** is exhausted. Therefore, I have devoted my heart to it.

*Collected Commentaries on the Authentic Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*
**Tang Emperor Minghuang’s Riverbank Master Wang Bi’s Commentary**
**Wang Fu’s Annotation**

**Dao/Way Classic**

**Xiu says:** The Dao/Way is that through which all things are guided. In essence, it is essence itself; in function, it is function itself. Boundless and nameless, yet nowhere absent—this is its nature.

Thus, even the sages’ teachings dwell within one aspect of it. Though confined to one aspect, they differ from the myriad schools only in that they do not stray from principle and align with the times.

**Chapter One: The Dao/Way That Can Be Spoken Of**

*"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of"*—
**He says:** This refers to the Dao/Way of governance and instruction in the states of Jin and Wei.

*"Is not the constant Dao/Way."*—
**He says:** It is not the Dao/Way of innate, eternal longevity.

The constant Dao/Way nourishes the spirit through non-action, governs the people through non-interference, conceals its brilliance and hides its radiance, erases its traces and obscures its origins—it cannot be named as Dao/Way.

**Xiu says:** The Dao/Way that can be spoken of adapts to the times and acts accordingly. The times shift without pause, and the Dao/Way responds in transformation. For creation and transformation never cease their work—what was once true is now false. Yet petty scholars cling to past brilliance as the root of the Dao/Way, pointing to the *Lianlu* as the abode of the Sage. Laozi now loosens their rigid interpretations and opens the path to ultimate truth. Hence, this opening chapter.

To grasp this is to recognize that even today’s teachings are not the constant Dao/Way.

*"What can be named"*—

The *He* says: This refers to the names of wealth, noble status, honor, and surpassing the world.
**Non-eternal names.**

The *Ming Huang* says: The Dao/Way is the wondrous function of the utmost emptiness; names are the designations given to things when they receive their essence.
Since its function can be applied to things, it is called *the Dao/Way that can be spoken of*.
Since names arise from function, it is called *the name that can be named*.
If its application is boundless and without fixed form, then it transcends any single Dao/Way.
Since things differ and their names vary, it transcends any single name.
Thus, it is said that names are forcibly imposed upon the Dao/Way, yet the Dao/Way itself remains nameless.

*The He* says: This is not a name that naturally and eternally abides.
**Eternal names** should be like an infant before speech, a falcon before its feathers part, a pearl still within the shell, or fine jade buried in stone—internally luminous yet externally appearing dull and crude.

*The Bi* says: The Dao/Way that can be spoken of and the names that can be named are but designations imposed upon things; these are not their eternal essence. What is truly beyond naming and speaking is their eternal nature.

*The Yu* says: Names arise from substance, and substance has form and measure. Once form and measure are complete, decay and ruin follow—how could this be eternal?
Only by grasping this non-eternality is one truly eternal.
**The nameless** is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

*The He* says: The nameless refers to the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way has no form, hence it cannot be named.
**The beginning** refers to the Dao/Way’s origin.
It exhales *qi* and spreads transformation, emerging from the void and nothingness, becoming the origin of Heaven and Earth.
**The named** is the mother of all things.

*The Ming Huang* says: The nameless is the wondrous origin.
When the wondrous origin manifests as *qi*, it sustains Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth rely on it for their beginning—thus it is nameless.
The named is the responsive application.
Once application is complete, it nourishes all things abundantly; things receive their nourishment, hence they are named.

*The He* says: The named refers to Heaven and Earth, which have form and position, and yin and yang have softness and hardness—this is their being named.
The mother of all things is Heaven and Earth, containing *qi* and giving birth to all things, nurturing them to maturity—like a mother tending her child.

*The Bi* says: All that exists originates from the nonexistent.
Thus, in the time before form and name, it is the beginning of all things.
When form and name appear, it nurtures and sustains them, protecting and guiding them—this is its role as mother.
Speaking of the Dao/Way as formless and nameless, yet it gives rise to all things—
Its beginning and completion are unknown; profound beyond measure.

*The Yu* says: Receiving its mandate from the nonexistent and forming in the existent, it is called the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the mother of all things.
The *Yijing* says: *"Only after Heaven and Earth came into being did all things emerge"*—this aligns with the *Yijing*’s sequence.
The vast expanse of Heaven and Earth encompasses all living things, hence Heaven and Earth are spoken of first.
Things and Heaven and Earth originally have no precedence; tracing them to their utmost, existence and nonexistence are one body.
The statement of "beginning and mother" is but a metaphor.
Moreover, though Heaven and Earth are vast, their receiving of the mandate and formation do not depart from existence and nonexistence.
Yet it is said that only the mother of all things is emphasized—thus Laozi’s words merely exhaust the nature of things.
**Eternally without desire**, one may observe its wondrous essence.

*The He* says: *Wondrous* means *essential*.
If one constantly refrains from desire, they may perceive the essential core of the Dao/Way.
*Essential* means *one*.

*The Bi* says: *Wondrous* is the utmost subtlety.
All things begin in subtlety and then manifest; they begin in nonexistence and then arise.
Thus, if one constantly refrains from desire, emptying their mind, they may observe the wondrous origin of things.
**Eternally with desire**, one may observe its *jiǎo* (boundaries).

*The Ming Huang* says: Human beings are born in stillness—this is Heaven’s nature.
When they encounter things, they move—this is the nature of desire.
If one constantly upholds purity and stillness, releases the mind, and reflects upon their true nature, they may observe the wondrous origin.
If one does not rectify their nature, their emotions follow desire and move, their nature lost to desire, straying from the Dao’s source.
To observe the wondrous origin while in such a state is to perceive only its *jiǎo* (boundaries).

*The He* says: *Jiǎo* means *return*.
Those who constantly indulge desire may observe the inclinations of the worldly.

*The Bi* says: *Jiǎo* means *return to termination*.
All that exists relies on the nonexistent for its use.
The origin of desire, when aligned with the Dao/Way, alone brings fulfillment.
Thus, those who constantly indulge desire may observe the termination of things.

*The Yun* says: The *Yijing*’s yin and yang, Laozi’s existence and nonexistence, even down to the Buddhist doctrine of *shí-kōng* (form and emptiness), are fundamentally one in essence, differing only in their exposition.
Those who speak of the nonexistent abandon the existent to seek the nonexistent—this is but another existent beyond the existent.
How could this be true nonexistence?
At the moment of its manifestation, it has never truly been existent—this is true nonexistence.
The body of existence and nonexistence is eternally one and existent.
Those who observe existence see only its *jiǎo* (boundaries).
To observe its wondrous essence, one must know its origin is nonexistent.
Yet the nonexistent origin is never truly existent.
Though it is said to be eternally nonexistent and eternally existent, it clarifies that existence and nonexistence do not succeed one another—
The nonexistent is true existence, the existent is true nonexistence.
Speaking of *jiǎo* reveals the profundity of the wondrous;
Speaking of the wondrous reveals the coarseness of *jiǎo*.
This is the principle of comparative exposition.
These two, though differing in name, share the same source.

*The Ming Huang* says: As above, both originate from the Dao/Way, hence they are the same.
Their application gives rise to movement, and names arise from their use—thus their names differ.

*The He* says: The two refer to having desire and not having desire.
They share the same origin—both arise from the human heart.
Yet their names differ—what they designate differs.
The name of *not having desire* leads to longevity;
The name of *having desire* leads to self-destruction.
Though differing in name, they are both called *Xuan* (profound).

*The Ming Huang* says: When they manifest, their names differ; yet in their origin, they are profound.
*Xuan* means profound and wondrous.

*The He* says: *Xuan* is Heaven.
It is said that those with desire and those without desire both receive *qi* from Heaven.

*The Yun* says: Existence and nonexistence originally are one, with no dual names.
From the perspective of the scholar, existence is not as refined as nonexistence.
Yet once the Dao/Way is attained, both are supreme truths—initially without distinction between them.

「The profound yet again profound,
*The He* says: Within Heaven, there is yet another Heaven.

The thickness of received *qi* varies,
To obtain the harmony of *zhōnghé* (central equilibrium) and the nourishment of *zīyè* (vital fluids),
One becomes a sage or saint;
To receive discordant, turbid, and defiled *qi*,
One becomes one who indulges in gluttony and licentiousness.
The gateway to myriad wonders.

*The Ming Huang* says: If the mind does not give rise to desire,
Then it aligns with the profound and wondrous.
Yet one may still fear clinging to the profound as stagnation,
Falling short of complete forgetfulness.
Thus, the phrase "profound yet again profound" dispels the profound,
Illustrating the clarity of *not having desire* within *not having desire*.
Those who can thus transcend
Shall be free from all vexation and confusion,
Hence the saying: the gateway to myriad wonders.

*The He* says: To comprehend Heaven within Heaven,
And the varying thickness of received *qi*,
To abandon emotional desire,
And uphold the harmony of *zhōnghé* (central equilibrium),
This is called the essential threshold of knowing the Dao/Way.

*The Bi* says: The two (profound and profound yet again) are initially called *mother* (origin).
When they manifest, they both arise from the profound.
Yet their differing names stem from what cannot be uniformly applied.
At the beginning, it is called *mother*;
At the end, it is called *profound*.
The profound is *míng* (obscure, hidden),
Silent and without form.
That from which *mother* and *profound* originate
Cannot be named, hence they cannot be spoken of as identical.
When we say "profound" and yet name it "profound yet again,"
We take from the unnameable and call it thus.
To name it thus is not to fix it as a single profound,
For if we fix it as a single profound alone,
Then its name would be far from the truth—
Hence the phrase: *profound yet again profound*.
All myriad wonders emerge through this gateway,
Thus it is called the gateway to myriad wonders.

*The Xiāo* says: The Dao/Way encompasses two things.
From form downward, it is that *yang* (bright, active) is exalted while *yīn* (dark, passive) is lowly;
From form upward, it is that *yīn* (dark, passive) precedes while *yang* (bright, active) follows.
Thus, the highest reaches of the Dao/Way are called *miào* (wondrous) and *xuán* (profound).
*Miào* is *virtue/power*;
*Xuán* is *color* (essence),
For when we speak of *color*, it has reached its peak,
Yet there remains what *color* cannot encompass—
Hence the phrase: *profound yet again profound*.
All things possess their wondrous essence,
All arising from this,
Thus it is called the gateway to myriad wonders.

**Chapter Two: "All Under Heaven Know Beauty"**

All under Heaven knows beauty as beauty,
*The He* says: To exalt one’s own beauty is to reveal it.
This is already evil.
*The He* says: This is like coarse jade.

All know goodness as goodness,
*The He* says: This is like merit and fame.
This is already not-goodness.

*The Ming Huang* says: Beauty and goodness arise from the heart of desire.
If the heart’s desires are unchecked,
Even what is evil becomes beautiful and good.
Thus it is said: All under Heaven knows what is beautiful to itself as beauty,
And what is good to itself as goodness.
Beauty and goodness have no fixed master—
They are merely deluded emotions,
All arising from clinging to distinctions of having and not-having,
Judging difficulty and ease,
And categorizing the divine and miraculous alongside the foul and rotten,
To mutually undermine and usurp one another.
The Great Sage (Buddha) weighs these matters deeply,
Knowing their emptiness and delusion—
Hence the saying: This is already evil.

*The He* says: This is what people contend over.
*The Yun* says: The Dao/Way originally has no things, yet things have deluded emotions,
Mutually distinguishing themselves.
This is to be swept away by the currents of transformation,
Unable to escape on one’s own.
Yet those swept away and unable to escape
Do not do so through aversion and detachment,
But through attachment and clinging—
Thus they abhor beauty and goodness.
Hence, evil and not-goodness follow beauty and goodness,
And when beauty and goodness are present,
Evil and not-goodness are already there as well.
To wait for their appearance and then awaken is already late in enlightenment.
Even so, the Perfect One’s so-called beauty and goodness
Never truly depart from evil and not-goodness,
While evil and not-goodness
Never truly depart from beauty and goodness.
The foolish of the world are not worthy of this discourse,
Thus beauty and goodness are always accompanied by evil and not-goodness.

Hence, having and not-having generate one another,
*The He* says: To see having as not-having.

Difficulty and ease complete one another,
*The He* says: To see difficulty as ease.

Long and short define one another,
*The He* says: To see shortness as length.

High and low incline toward one another,
*The He* says: To see height as low.

Sounds blend harmoniously,
*The He* says: When the upper sings, the lower must respond in harmony.

Front and back follow one another,
*The Ming Huang* says: These six pairs oppose each other,
Alternately becoming their respective names—
Just as with beauty and evil,
They do not arise from inherent nature,
But from deluded emotions,
And thus these manifold distinctions emerge.

*The He* says: When the upper moves, the lower must follow.
*The Bi* says: Beauty is what the human heart delights in and pursues.
Evil is what the human heart abhors and recoils from.
Beauty and evil are like joy and anger—
Joy and anger share the same root;
Goodness and not-goodness share the same gateway—
Thus one cannot take them in isolation.
These six distinctions are all manifest truths of nature,
Unalterable and not to be taken in isolation.

*The Xiù* says: To separate from the Dao/Way and cling to the self,
The self then has its opposite.
Once self and opposite are divided,
They are classified into two.
These six pairs are why things are not uniform,
And why the transformations of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight,
And life and death,
Endlessly arise and recede without cessation.
All this stems from not comprehending the original *yīn-yáng* (dark and bright),
But following their superficial currents,
Giving rise to distinctions,
Clinging to one while abandoning the rest,
And taking delusion as reality.

This chapter is similar to *Zhuāngzi’s* "Equivalence of Things,"
Each passage unfolding logically.
Thus the sage dwells in affairs of *wuwéi* (non-action),
*The He* says: Governed by the Dao/Way.

*The Bi* says: Nature is already sufficient—
Action brings ruin.

The sage does not adhere to the teachings of *Huáng* (Yellow Emperor),
*The Ming Huang* says: Affairs of *wuwéi* (non-action) are without action.
Using the term "affairs" metaphorically, hence "dwells."
Teachings of *non-speech*, forgotten in speech—
Using the term "teachings" metaphorically, hence "does not adhere."

*The He* says: Leading with the body to guide others.
*The Yun* says: The sage has no heart of his own,
Taking the hearts of the people as his heart.
Though he engages in affairs, he never intrudes upon the paths of action,
Though he teaches, he never reveals the intent behind the words—
Thus affairs are harmonized,
And teachings are carried out,
While I remain tranquil and unburdened,
Never beginning to speak for the sake of speech,
And yet all under Heaven thereby returns to its natural state,
Restoring simplicity and purity.

It is only because there is no burden,
That though he takes form between *yīn* (dark) and *yáng* (bright),
Creation and transformation cannot compel him to these six opposing pairs,
Nor can evil disturb him.»

The myriad things act without refusal,
*The Ming Huang* says: To let the myriad things each attain their own movement and action without refusal or thanks to the Sage.

*The He* says: Each moves on its own, refusing nothing yet halting none.
*The Xiu* says: The myriad things act together, the Sage letting each fulfill its nature without refusal, for my heart is empty, taking and discarding nothing. If one harbors thoughts of taking or discarding, then the myriad forms—beautiful and ugly—how could they not be refused?

Born yet not possessed,
*The He* says: The Original *qi* gives birth to the myriad things yet does not possess them.

Acting yet not relying,
*The He* says: The Dao’s actions are not done with expectation of return.
*The Bi* says: Wisdom is self-sufficient; action is artifice.

When the work is done, not dwelling upon it,
*The Ming Huang* says: To let the myriad things each fulfill their growth, not claiming them as one’s own, each attaining what they do without reliance—thus the great peace’s work is accomplished. Yet one must still daily be cautious, never daring to rest content.
*The He* says: When the work is done and the matter settled, one retreats and does not dwell in the position.
*The Bi* says: The function arises from things; thus the work is accomplished by them, so one does not dwell upon it.
*The Xiu* says: If there is dwelling, then it must be relinquished.

Only because one does not dwell,
*The He* says: Only because the work is done does one not dwell in the position.

Thus one does not depart.
*The Ming Huang* says: Only because one does not dare to rest content, and ever increases one’s virtue, does one forget the work while the work remains—thus one does not dwell yet does not depart.
*The He* says: Virtue and blessing abide, not leaving the body.

The six preceding lines have high and low, long and short—like opening a single source, from which a hundred branches arise. The transformations of these hundred branches never fail to move and disrupt.
*The Bi* says: If the work is attributed to oneself, then the work cannot endure.
*The Yun* says: Form and name descend, all undergoing substitution. Only the Dao has no substance; nothing can displace it. The Sage embodies the Dao, thus filling and permeating without bounds, yet never possessing anything. Responding to myriad changes, yet never having a mind—thus how could one fixate on transient matters as achievements and firmly possess them?

Only then does one transcend the six opposing pairs, sever the names of beauty and ugliness, surpassing birth and death to dwell in the eternal law. Holding this heart to traverse the world, even if achievements and fame are lofty, how could there be the burden of fullness?

**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Virtuous**

Not exalting the virtuous,
*The He* says: The virtuous refers to the worldly virtuous—those who twist words and clarify texts, departing from the Dao and employing expedients, abandoning simplicity for artifice. Not exalting means not honoring them with rewards, not elevating them with office, so that the people do not contend.

*The Ming Huang* says: To exalt the virtuous is to have traces; to follow traces is to stir contention. If the virtuous and unvirtuous each fulfill their proper roles, then there will be no contention.
*The He* says: Not contending over achievements and fame is returning to nature.
*The Xiu* says: The virtuous are those who excel among the people. To exalt them causes the people to boast and emulate externally, stirring the seeds of contention.

Not valuing hard-to-obtain goods,
*The He* says: The ruler does not indulge in precious treasures—gold abandoned in the mountains, pearls cast into the depths—so that the people do not become thieves.

*The Ming Huang* says: Hard-to-obtain goods are those beyond one’s natural endowment. To seek what cannot be obtained is why they are called hard to obtain. If one does not rest in one’s proper role and aspires to what one lacks, having already lost one’s natural endowment, is this not theft?

To let things fulfill their nature and affairs accord with their capacities, then hard-to-obtain goods will not be valued, and the essence of life will not be stolen.
*The He* says: The upper reaches are pure and tranquil; the lower does not devour the living.
*The Xiu* says: When the people’s clothing and food are sufficient, their nature settles. If one vainly values hard-to-obtain goods, then their seeking will be endless, and secrecy will lead to theft.

Indeed, the people’s lives all arise from deluded distinctions. This chapter strives to equalize things, letting the people return to their nature.

Not seeing what is desirable,
*The He* says: Banish the *Zheng* music, distance flatterers, so that the heart does not become disordered.

*The Ming Huang* says: Having neither the path of exalting the virtuous nor the pursuit of hard-to-obtain goods, there are no visible desires, and thus the heart is not confused.
*The He* says: No licentiousness.
*The Bi* says: The virtuous are those with ability; to exalt is to praise them by name. To honor is to elevate them in rank. If only ability is entrusted, why praise? If only this is applied, why honor? To exalt the virtuous displays fame, surpassing their capacity, causing the lower ranks to scramble and compete, their abilities vying with one another. To honor goods beyond use causes those who consume to rush toward them, digging and borrowing to fill their baskets, risking their lives in theft. Thus it is sung: "Not seeing [desires], then the heart is not disordered."
*The Xiu* says: The ignorant delude themselves into seeing what is desirable, thus their hearts are disordered by it. Only the Sage knows all things are not truly real, thus all forms are viewed equally, and there is no heart of preference or rejection. If so, then the heart remains ever impoverished and tranquil—how could things disorder it? Thus one is able not to exalt the virtuous, not to value goods.

Therefore, the Sage’s governance,
*The He* says: Explaining that the Sage’s governance of the state and of the self are the same.

Is to empty the heart,
*The Ming Huang* says: If the heart is not disordered by what is desirable, then it is empty.
*The He* says: Remove desires, dispel confusion.
*The Xiu* says: An empty heart knows no distinctions—this is the meaning of not exalting the virtuous.

And fill the belly,
*The Ming Huang* says: Inner virtue is complete, thus there is no arrogance or resentment, like stopping when full, not generating demands.
*The He* says: Embrace the Dao, hold to oneness, guard the Five Spirits.
*The Bi* says: The heart harbors wisdom, the belly harbors food—empty in wisdom, yet full in ignorance.
*The Xiu* says: A full belly knows no greed—this further explains not valuing goods.

And weaken the will,
*The Ming Huang* says: An empty heart weakens the will.

*The He* says: To know softness, humility, and yielding—this is to avoid seizing power.

*The Xiu* says: A strong will leads to arrogance and victory, while a weak will avoids external scheming—this further explains the meaning of not exalting the virtuous.

**Strengthen the bones,**
*The Ming Huang* says: A full belly strengthens the bones.

*The He* says: Cherish essence, practice moderation in giving—when marrow is full, bones are firm.

*The Bi* says: Bones have no knowledge yet are burdened by deeds; the will generates chaos.

*The Yun* says: Strong bones are for self-reliance; self-reliance means external things cannot sway one. This further explains the meaning of not valuing goods.

**Always keep the people without knowledge or desire,**
*The Ming Huang* says: Always keep people from striving for excellence and from demanding what they desire.

*The He* says: Return to simplicity, guard purity.

*The Bi* says: Preserve their true nature.

*The Yu* says: Knowledge leads to false perceptions; desire leads to external seeking. Once these two are removed, nature and disposition are settled.

From not exalting the virtuous comes transformation—one can lead them to a state of no knowledge.
From not valuing goods comes transformation—one can lead them to a state of no desire.

**Let those who know dare not act,**
*The Ming Huang* says: Through stillness and tranquility, people are purified of knowledge and desire. Those who possess [knowledge] are forbidden from acting.

*The He* says: Deep contemplation—do not speak lightly.

*The Bi* says: "Those who know" refers to those who act on knowledge.

*The Yun* says: Those whose intelligence disturbs the masses must be restrained.

**Act without action,**
*The He* says: Do not contrive; move by following natural course. Then nothing remains untamed.

*The Ming Huang* says: In acting without action, people return to their true nature, and pure transformation is sincere.

*The He* says: Virtuous cultivation is profound; the people are at peace.

*The Yun* says: "Act without action" is not true inaction. Action lies in non-action alone, aiming to restore true nature.

I have often reflected: After the Three Dynasties, no one has failed to lose their true nature. Thus, the noble strengthen their will and love goodness, seeking the virtuous without end, while the common weaken their bones and covet gain, pursuing wealth without satisfaction.

A strong will leads to excess knowledge; weak bones lead to excess desire. Some seek knowledge, others seek desire—though their pursuits differ, both harm their essence by clinging to externals.

Only the Perfect One differs: they weaken their will, not indulging in what they see, humbling themselves to seek the near, regarding it as having no desires, while the Dao suffices within.

They strengthen their bones, not to establish themselves as virtuous, but to overcome desires for profit, and to honor innate virtue.

Only then are name and gain unable to sway them, and their nature remains steadfast.

**Chapter Four: Dao Chong (The Unobstructed Dao)**

The Dao is unobstructed yet applied,

*The He* says: *Chong* means central—Dao hides its name, conceals its merit; its application lies in the center. Sometimes it does not overflow.

*The Ming Huang* says: The Dao moves with harmonious *qi*, and its application generates creation. Though creation is its function, it never overflows. "Sometimes" is used because one does not dare speak directly of the Dao.

*The He* says: *Chong* is constant—Dao is always humble, never overflowing.

*The Xiu* says: The Dao fills all yet has no end, suffices for all things, yet never possesses. Thus, it is said to sometimes not overflow. Whether empty or full, it is called *chong*. *Chong* is the balance of yin and yang, its essence being emptiness.

The Dao’s application to things is central.
The Dao’s response to affairs is emptiness.
This passage speaks of its application, hence *chong*.

Deep and vast, it seems the ancestor of all things.

*The Ming Huang* says: *Yuan* means profound and still. The Dao constantly generates things yet never overflows. Its mystery lies in its depth and stillness, thus it seems to be the ancestor of all things.

*The He* says: The Dao is deep and unfathomable, appearing as the ancestral origin of all things.

*The Yun* says: The Dao generates all things yet never separates from them. Observed from the dispersion of things, it seems to be their ancestor alone. *Yuan* means deep and immeasurable.

People are inherently sufficient in this Dao. Those who seek to embody it must not seek elsewhere—only by blunting sharpness, resolving chaos, harmonizing light, and blending with the mundane will they preserve themselves.

**Blunt the sharp,**
*The He* says: *Rui* means to blunt—people sharpen their essence, striving for fame and position; this must be corrected by aligning with the Dao, which does not reveal itself.

*The Xiu* says: Blunting sharpness makes one whole. *Rui* is the form of a point.

**Resolve the chaotic,**
*The Ming Huang* says: The Dao acts with *chong* and harmony, thus it suppresses sharpness and disperses confusion. If vulgar scholars seek distinctions, they only bind themselves further.

*The He* says: *Fen* means entangled resentment. One must reflect on the Dao’s non-action to resolve it.

*The Yun* says: If one does not engage with things but sits observing their return, nature and life settle, and chaos resolves.

**Harmonize its light,**
*The He* says: Though one may have singular insight, it should be obscured, not used to dazzle others.

*The Yun* says: Blunting sharpness and resolving chaos settle nature and disposition, naturally filling with radiant light. Once light appears, it must not differ from things but blend with them—*The Book of Changes* says: "Mingled and indistinct."

**Blend with the dust,**
*The Ming Huang* says: The Dao is everywhere yet nowhere. In light or dust, it is one with all. One with light and dust, yet not light or dust.

*The He* says: One should blend with the common and impure, not separate oneself.

*The Xiu* says: The Dao is the constant of nature. Obtaining nature’s constant, what is there to prize or exalt? Thus, the Perfect One has the Dao yet does not differ from the dust.

**Still and seeming to exist,**
*The Ming Huang* says: Harmonizing light and blending with dust, its mystery remains undefiled, thus it is still and seems to exist.

*The He* says: One should remain still and tranquil, thus enduring without perishing.

*The Yun* says: If a person follows the four matters above, the Dao will remain still within them.

**Existing yet defined as having form, then it is not the Dao.**
*Seeming to exist*—this is what cannot be defined as having form.

I do not know whose child I am.
*The He* says: Laozi said, *"I do not know my origin."*

*The Xiu* says: Within the very essence of what is now called the Dao, there is indeed a source. Though it has a source, it remains serene and formless—thus, *"I do not know whose child I am."*

**Resembling the Sovereign before the Sovereign.**
*The Ming Huang* says: I do not know my origin, for the Dao is not a generated law. Thus, there is no "fatherly Dao"—it seems to exist before the Sovereign.

The Sovereign is the master of all things.
*Symbol*—this is *seeming*.
*The He* says: The Dao exists before the Celestial Sovereign—this speaks of the Dao arising before Heaven and Earth.

*The Bi* says: One who clings to a single family’s measure cannot encompass the whole family. One who clings to a single kingdom’s measure cannot establish the kingdom. Exhausting strength to lift heavy burdens, yet it serves no purpose—thus, though people may know how to govern all things, if they do not govern by the two principles of Heaven and Earth, they cannot sustain them.

Though Earth has form and vitality, it does not conform to Heaven’s law, and is ashamed it cannot preserve its tranquility. Though Heaven is refined and vast, it cannot conform to the Dao, and thus cannot preserve its purity.

Empty yet used, its use cannot be exhausted. Full yet pursuing substance, substance arrives and it overflows—thus, empty yet used, it is again not full. Its limitlessness is already profound.

Though form is vast, it cannot burden its essence. Though affairs are numerous, they cannot fill its measure. All things abandon this and seek their master—where is their master?

Is it not profound, resembling the root of all things?

Sharp yet unharmed, chaotic yet without labor, harmonizing light yet unstained—its essence blends with dust yet does not stray, its mystery is thus. *Seeming to exist.*

Earth upholds its form and virtue, yet cannot exceed its capacity. Heaven restrains its symbolic virtue, yet cannot exceed its coverage. Heaven and Earth cannot reach it—is it not like the Sovereign before the Sovereign?

The Sovereign is the Celestial Sovereign.
*The Xiu* says: *Symbol*—the omen of form. The Sovereign—one of exalted things. Though one becomes a sovereign king, the Dao transcends even this.

**Heaven and Earth are not benevolent (Chapter Five)**

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent.
*The He* says: Heaven bestows, Earth transforms, not through benevolent favor, but through natural course.

They treat all things as straw dogs.
*The Ming Huang* says: Heaven and Earth give birth to all things, and though humans are most noble, Heaven and Earth regard them as straw and dogs—no expectation of repayment.

*The He* says: Heaven and Earth act naturally, without contrivance. All things self-regulate, thus they are not benevolent. Benevolence must contrive and act; with contrivance and action, things lose their authenticity. With favor and contrivance, things cannot fully exist. If things do not fully exist, they cannot suffice.

Heaven and Earth do not grow straw for beasts to eat, nor dogs for humans—without contrivance, all things find their proper use, and none lack.

If wisdom arises from oneself, it is still insufficient.

*The Xiu* says: Straw dogs are used in sacrifices. When employed, they are treated with solemn rites and respect, but once discarded, they are cast aside like dung. Though treated with utmost sincerity, they are merely bound straw—what is there truly to revere? Though unworthy of reverence, they are treated as such—not for their own sake.

All things follow their natural course: birth, death, formation, decay. This is the natural order, yet Heaven and Earth alone are called parents. Thus, they cannot help but love, but to examine Heaven and Earth’s intent—what burden is there?

When they love, though with utmost sincerity, all things proceed naturally—there is nothing truly to love. In the end, all return to dust—why cling to emotion?

The Sage is not benevolent.
*The He* says: The Sage nurtures the people not through benevolence, but by following Heaven and Earth’s natural course.

*The Yun* says: Benevolence is human—loving things with human affection is benevolence. Yet if it is human in appearance but Heavenly in nature, how can benevolence name it?

He treats the people as straw dogs.
*The Ming Huang* says: Not benevolent means no benevolent favor. A straw dog is straw bound into a dog’s shape. Dogs guard with barking—this is a kind of favor. But a straw dog has only the form of a dog, no barking function—thus, it has no place in benevolent love. This says that Heaven and Earth regard humans as straw dogs—no expectation of gratitude.

Let me examine this further: The most benevolent has no favorites—who then practices universal love? Love that is not universal is partial. Not favoring only one’s kin means all are kin. Not favoring only one’s children means all are children. Thus, the most benevolent’s lack of favor is the ultimate favor—how can it be called *universal love*?

*The He* says: The Sage regards the people as straw and dogs, expecting no gratitude or reverence.

*The Bi* says: The Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth’s virtue, comparing the people to straw dogs.

*The Yun* says: The Sage loves his kin and is benevolent to the people—thus, he speaks only of the people. Yet his Dao is one with Heaven and Earth, though humans have form, their roles differ.

---
**Between Heaven and Earth,**
*The He* says: Between Heaven and Earth lies emptiness, where harmonious *qi* circulates, and thus all things arise naturally. If a person eliminates desires, moderates tastes, clears the five organs, then the spirit dwells within.

It is like the *tuo* and *yue*.
*The Ming Huang* says: *Tuo* is a windbag, *yue* is a pipe. The windbag’s blowing, the pipe’s playing—both are empty and without intent, yet they move and respond.

Thus, between Heaven and Earth, all things arise without partiality—
for it is their emptiness and lack of intent that allows it.

*The He* says: Within the *tuo* and *yue*, emptiness resides,
and thus they produce sound and *qi*.

*The Yun* says: The *tuo* and *yue* are empty yet responsive—
when things act upon them, they respond.
They respond yet do not hoard;
Heaven and Earth’s relation to all things,
the Sage’s relation to the people—
they meet each thing in its proper measure,
yet are not bound by the present moment,
nor cling to the past.
Thus, they are likened to the *tuo* and *yue*’s boundless nature.
Empty yet unyielding, moving yet ever more abundant.

*The Ming Huang* says: The *tuo* and *yue*, though empty, do not bend.
When moved, their sound grows ever stronger—
just as the Sage, with no partial favor,
has no time of bending,
and his applications are boundless—
truly, moving yet ever more abundant.

*The He* says: This speaks of emptiness never exhausted,
of motion ever increasing in sound and *qi*.

*The Bi* says: *Pì*—this is the *tuo*’s bellows.
*Yue*—this is the *yue*’s flute.
Within the *tuo* and *yue*, hollow and void,
without sentiment or action,
they are empty yet never exhausted,
moving yet never spent.
Between Heaven and Earth, all is vast and unrestrained,
following Nature’s course,
and thus cannot be exhausted—
just as the *tuo* and *yue*.

*The Yun* says: Empty their form,
active their function.
Excessive speech leads to exhaustion,

「The *He* says: Excessive activity harms the spirit, excessive speech harms the body. When the mouth opens and the tongue moves, calamity is sure to follow. ○The *Yun* says: If one does not speak in accordance with the Dao, then one is exhausted. To utter words is to make them known—this is the way of the Sage, who speaks yet does not act. Better to hold to the Middle. ○The *Mínghuáng* says: Excessive speech without cultivation leads to repeated exhaustion and bending.

To love all is difficult to extend, and thus invites resentment and hatred; better to embrace and hold the Middle Way, where all suffices naturally.

○The *He* says: Better to uphold *virtue/power* within the Middle, nurturing the spirit and *qi*, loving silence while sparing speech. ○The *Bi* says: The more one strives to act, the more one loses it. Things grow their own evils, and actions err in their words. Disordered, unspoken, and unprincipled, this is the repeated path to exhaustion. When the *tuo* and *yue* hold to the Middle Way, they are inexhaustible; when one abandons oneself to external forces, all things are governed. If the *tuo* and *yue* intend to produce sound, they cannot meet the demands of the player.

○The *Yun* says: Holding to the Middle Way is how one responds to all transformations.

**Chapter Six: The Unending Spirit of the Valley**

The Unending Spirit of the Valley,
○The *Mínghuáng* says: The *valley* (谷) is empty yet capable of response; the *spirit* (神) is subtle yet unfathomable. *Death* (死) here means rest. The valley’s response to sound is beyond knowing—when there is sensation, it responds; its response is like a spirit, like a spirit’s response, yet it never rests. To illuminate the supreme Dao: empty yet giving rise to all things, its wondrous applications defy naming, hence the use of the *Unending Spirit of the Valley* as a metaphor.

○The *He* says: The *valley* is nourishment; when humans nourish their spirit, they do not die. By *spirit* (神), I mean the vital essence of the five *zàng* organs. The liver stores the *hun* (魂), the lungs the *pò* (魄), the heart the *shén* (神), the kidneys the *jīng* (精), and the spleen the *zhì* (志). When the five *zàng* organs are all injured, the five spirits depart.

○The *Yun* says: The valley responds yet is never exhausted; the spirit transforms yet is unfathomable. All things receive their mandate from it, yet it neither originates nor perishes—this is the *Unending Spirit of the Valley*. When speaking of the spirit, it is already at its utmost, but adding the *valley* signifies that it can be both empty and full, yet also capable of containing and responding. Because it is active yet never worn out, it is simply called the *Unending Spirit*.

This is called the *Dark Feminine* (玄牝).

○The *Mínghuáng* says: *Dark* (玄) means profound; *Feminine* (牝) means mother. The *Unending Spirit of the Valley* responds to all things, its applications boundless and profound, unfathomable yet able to give birth to all things. Thus, it is named the *Unending Spirit of the Valley* to illuminate the great Dao’s function of giving life and sustaining.

○The *He* says: The Dao of not dying lies in the *Dark Feminine*. *Dark* (玄) is Heaven, which in humans is the *nose* (鼻); *Feminine* (牝) is Earth, which in humans is the *mouth* (江). Heaven nourishes humans with the five *qi* (五气), entering through the nose and stored in the heart. The five *zàng* organs, cleansed and bright, become the spirit’s clarity, intelligence, and the five faculties—sound, vision, and the three *po* (豚). Their *ghost* (鬼) is called the *hun* (魂), which is masculine, governing entry and exit through the nose, communicating with Heaven. Thus, the nose is called the *Dark* (玄).

Earth nourishes humans with the five flavors, entering through the mouth and stored in the stomach. The five faculties grow turbid and debased, forming the body’s flesh, bones, blood, and the six *emotions* (六情). Their *ghost* (鬼) is called the *pò* (魄), which is feminine, governing entry and exit through the mouth, communicating with Earth. Thus, it is called the *Feminine* (牝).

○The *Xiù* says: The *Unending Spirit of the Valley* receives its mandate and manifests as the *Dark Feminine*, assigning itself to become yin and yang, thus completing Heaven and Earth—yet it is fundamentally one thing. By its reception of the mandate, it is called the *Unending Spirit of the Valley*; by its manifestation as form, it is called the *Dark Feminine*. The *Dark Feminine*’s gate is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth*.

○The *Mínghuáng* says: The profound, subtle, empty, and feminine can give birth to all things, and all things emerge through it. This is called the *gate* (门). Heaven and Earth have form, so their innate essence is the root foundation.

○The *He* says: *Root* (根) is *primordial* (元). The gate of the nose and mouth is where the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth flows, coming and going.

○The *Xiù* says: Though the *Dark Feminine* embodies yin, within its singularity, yin and yang are both present. The term *gate* (门) differs from *door* (户); all things emerge through this gate yet remain unseen, hence the phrase *Dark Feminine’s gate*. Endlessly sustained,

○The *He* says: The breathing through the nose and mouth should be continuous and subtle, as if present yet also as if nonexistent.

○The *Yun* says: *Endless* (绵绵) means drawn out yet unbroken. The *Dark Feminine* generates all things without end, yet its presence is indeterminate—neither fixed nor absent. It is not exhausted in use.

○The *Mínghuáng* says: The applications of the empty *Feminine* are endless and subtle, responding as if present, yet its use requires no effort, so it does not weary.

○The *He* says: The use of *qi* should be expansive and relaxed, not hasty or labored.

○The *Bi* says: The *Unending Spirit of the Valley* is the center of the valley, yet has no valley—no form, no shadow, no resistance, no obstruction. It remains low yet unmoved, guards stillness without decay. The valley completes yet reveals no form—this is the supreme thing. Though it remains low and cannot be named, it is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth*, endless yet subtly present, used without labor. The *gate* (门) is the source of the *Dark Feminine*. Tracing its origin, it shares the same body as the *Ultimate* (极), hence it is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth*. If one says it exists, its form is unseen; if one says it does not exist, all things arise from it. Thus, it is endless yet subtly present. It completes all things, yet its use does not exhaust—hence, *used yet unmoved*.

○The *Xiù* says: How can there be movement when it grows ever stronger? The *Daoist Canon of the Supreme Virtue and Power* concludes here. #1 *Zhèng*: The original text lacks this, supplemented from the *Zhèngtǒng Daoist Treasury* edition of *Tang Xuánzōng’s Imperial Commentary on the Daoist Canon of the Supreme Virtue and Power*. #2 *Xìng*: Originally 『与』, changed according to the Daoist Treasury edition of Tang Xuánzōng’s commentary. #3 *Suǒ*: Originally 『则』, changed according to the Daoist Treasury edition of Tang Xuánzōng’s commentary. #4 *Mí*: Originally 『尔』, changed according to the *Zhèngtǒng Daoist Treasury* edition of *Tang Xuánzōng’s Imperial Commentary on the Daoist Canon of the Supreme Virtue and Power*.」

**Daoist Canon of the Supreme Virtue and Power: Imperial Commentary by Emperor Xuánzōng**
**Volume II: Commentary by Master Héshànggōng Wáng Bì and Wáng Hóng**

**Chapter 7: Heaven Long, Earth Enduring**
Heaven long, earth enduring.

Emperor Xuánzōng says: Those who mark heaven and earth’s enduring nature seek to illustrate that without selfishness or scheming, one may endure and last. This analogy is fulfilled by the Sage, who transcends the body and yet preserves it—without selfishness, yet achieving it.

○ Master Hé says: When speaking of heaven and earth’s eternal life and longevity, it is to instruct humanity.

Heaven and earth endure long because they do not generate themselves.
○ Master Hé says: Heaven and earth alone endure long because they are tranquil, giving without seeking return, unlike humans who dwell in places and eagerly hoard private gain, robbing others to enrich themselves.

○ Master Bì says: If one generates oneself, one contends with things; if one does not generate oneself, things return to it.

Thus, it endures.

Emperor Xuánzōng says: Heaven and earth nourish life with vast virtue, yet endure long because they draw their endowment from the Dao, not arrogating the merit of creation.

○ Master Hé says: Because they do not seek life, they endure without end.

○ Master Xiù says: If one generates oneself, there is one’s own life—once life is lost, it is already gone. Only by not taking life as one’s own does life never truly arise. If life never arises, though the form that hosts it lives, it bears no burden of life, hence its enduring nature.

Heaven and earth’s not generating themselves is not for the sake of enduring—such is simply the Dao’s way. Yet what is called enduring is but a fleeting moment; only what sustains the heavens and earth without ever failing is its true essence.

Thus, the Sage places his body last,
○ Master Hé says: To serve others before oneself.

Yet his body is first.
○ Master Hé says: The world reveres him, placing him first as leader.

○ Master Hóng says: Though the Sage is Sage, his form aligns with all things—only by embodying the Dao without contention does he stand apart from the masses. If he establishes himself against others, even common folk could surpass him.

He sets his body aside,
○ Master Hé says: To diminish oneself and enrich others.

Yet his body is preserved.

Emperor Xuánzōng says: Placing the body last, others willingly honor him—thus his body is first. Setting the body aside, his mind becomes serene—thus his body is preserved.

○ Master Hé says: The people love him as a parent, the spirits protect him as a child—thus his body endures.

○ Master Hóng says: If one clings to the self to preserve it, all things become enemies. Only by transcending and abandoning the self—having no self—can nothing overturn him. Is this not because of his lack of selfishness?

○ Master Hé says: The Sage is loved by people and favored by spirits—not because of his fairness and lack of selfishness?

Thus, he fulfills his private ends.

Emperor Xuánzōng says: Heaven and earth forget their nurturing function—that is lack of selfishness. Yet they endure long—that is fulfilling their private ends. The Sage places his body last and sets it aside—that is lack of selfishness. Yet he leads and preserves—that is fulfilling his private ends.

○ Master Hé says: What others call selfishness is to enrich oneself. The Sage, without selfishness, enriches himself—thus he fulfills his private ends.

○ Master Bì says: Lack of selfishness means doing nothing to the self. The body leads, the body is preserved—thus it is said he fulfills his private ends.

○ Master Xiù says: The Sage lacks selfishness because he has never had a self. If one calculates and acts for it, what is more selfish than that?

**Chapter 8: The Supreme Good as Water**
The supreme good is like water.

Emperor Xuánzōng says: To illustrate the Sage’s supreme goodness, water’s nature is likened to the Dao.

○ Master Hé says: The supremely good person is like water’s nature.

○ Master Hóng says: Water is the first of the Five Phases, emerging from emptiness into substance. Near the Dao, its nature is closest to it—separate from the Dao, goodness is established. The supreme good is like water; this is the natural order of things.

Water benefits all things,
○ Master Hé says: In heaven, it is mist and dew; on earth, springs and sources.

Yet does not contend.
It dwells where all hate,
○ Master Hé says: People abhor lowliness, filth, and murkiness, yet water alone remains tranquil and flows there.

○ Master Bì says: People hate what is low.

○ Master Hóng says: *Chǔ* [dwells], one text reads *jū* [resides].

Thus, it nearly attains the Dao.

Emperor Xuánzōng says: *Jī* [nearly] means near.

○ Master Hé says: Water’s nature nearly aligns with the Dao.

○ Master Bì says: The Dao has no form; water does—thus *jī* [nearly].

○ Master Xiù says: Humans have hearts; the heart is fire, rising and illuminating, thus they love contention. Only those who forget the heart and embody the Dao can benefit others without scheming to overcome them.

It dwells in good ground,
Emperor Xuánzōng says: The supremely good person, in body weak and yielding, is like water dwelling in the earth—nourishing all things. The earth, though low, is useful; water flows downward.

○ Master Hé says: Water’s nature delights in the earth. Above grass and trees, it flows downward, having power to move the earth and descend to people.

○ Master Xiù says: It trends downward and flows.

Its heart is deep,
Emperor Xuánzōng says: The mind, deep and tranquil, is like water’s still pools.

○ Master Hé says: Water is deep and hollow; deep pools are clear and bright.

○ Master Hóng says: Deep and tranquil, internally luminous yet externally obscure.

It gives with goodness,
Emperor Xuánzōng says: Its giving aligns with supreme benevolence, like water nourishing all things.

○ Master Hé says: All things receive water to live; it gives to the empty, not the full.

Its speech is trustworthy,
Emperor Xuánzōng says: Its words are true, like water’s path through peril—never failing in truth.

○ Master Hé says: Water’s inner reflection mirrors form, never losing its essence.

○ Master Hóng says: All currents flow east.

Its governance is well-ordered,

Emperor Xuánzōng says: In governance, its administration is well-ordered, just as water cleanses all things, making them pure and tranquil.

○ Master Hé says: Nothing remains uncleansed; it is both clear and even.
○ Master Hóng says: It follows principle without yielding to caprice, accumulating softness and weakness to overcome the rigid and vast.

In matters, it excels in ability,
Emperor Xuánzōng says: In handling affairs, it skillfully adapts, like water’s nature—squaring and rounding to fit its vessel, never obstructed by things.
○ Master Hé says: It can be square or round, bending and straightening to match form.
○ Master Hóng says: It adapts to every change, thus nothing is beyond its ability.

In action, it is timely,
Emperor Xuánzōng says: It responds to things in season, never missing its time, like water floating in spring and congealing in winter.
○ Master Hé says: In summer it disperses, in winter it congeals, moving in due season without losing the Way’s timing.
○ Master Hóng says: If it flows when unobstructed, it stops when blocked—never acting before things, yet never missing its time.

Only the non-contending,
Master Hé says: When blocked, it stops; when urged, it flows—it follows human guidance.
Thus, there is no blame.

Emperor Xuánzōng says: The highest virtue is a tranquil heart, yielding to things, like water’s nature—stopping when blocked, flowing when released—never opposing or flattering things, thus never falling into fault or blame.
○ Master Hé says: Water’s nature is such, so none under heaven blame water.
○ Master Bì says: All speech about water aligns with this Way.
○ Master Hóng says: Water’s essence is singular, yet nothing can alter it, thus it encompasses all these virtues. It has virtue for things while always yielding to them—this is how it attains virtue. If one seeks virtue with intent, virtue cannot be achieved—thus the text concludes by repeating this.

**Chapter Nine: *Holding and Filling***

*Holding and filling it,*
Emperor Xuánzōng says: Clinging to fullness, preventing loss, amassing wealth as a burden—regret and stinginess arise—thus it is better to cease.
*Cease* means *stop*.

○ Master Hé says: *Fullness* means *excess*. *Cease* means *stop*. Holding excess leads to loss; it is better to stop.
○ Master Bì says: *Holding* means not losing virtue. If virtue is not lost yet one still fills it, danger of collapse is inevitable—thus it is better to cease, meaning it is worse than having no virtue or merit.
○ Master Hóng says: Clinging to fullness stems from desiring possession; this is how loss occurs. Only by forgetting possession as possession, and holding it as non-possession, can there be no loss or overflow.

*Measuring and sharpening it,*
Emperor Xuánzōng says: Calculating and sharpening—pursuing honor and wealth—necessarily leads to arrogance, inviting calamity, thus it cannot be long preserved.
○ Master Hé says: *Measuring* means *governing*; first measuring, then inevitably discarding.
○ Master Bì says: Already measuring to make it sharp, then sharpening it further—inevitably it will falter, thus it cannot be long preserved.
○ Master Hóng says: *Measuring* is skill in gauging others’ emotions; *sharpening* is skill in penetrating things. Yet affairs are endless, and if one holds to a single self amid change, then the skill of measuring and sharpening will sometimes falter—how can it be long preserved? Thus, the perfect person follows the seasons, rides the principle, and meets them with no-self, so their actions are boundless and their responses inexhaustible.

*Gold and jade fill the hall,*
Emperor Xuánzōng says: This clearly shows that fullness cannot be long held.
○ Master Hé says: Lustful desires harm the spirit; wealth burdens the body.
○ Master Bì says: It is better to cease.
○ Master Hóng says: Clinging externally to things—what is held is not truly possessed—how can it endure?

*Rich and noble yet arrogant,*
Emperor Xuánzōng says: This clearly shows that sharpness cannot be measured.
Arrogance arises from the heart’s generation—blame comes from within.
○ Master Hé says: When rich, one should relieve the poor; when noble, one should pity the lowly. Instead, they indulge in arrogance and invite disaster.
○ Master Bì says: It cannot be long preserved.
○ Master Xiù says: Arrogance stems from relying on externals—those who rely on externals are unworthy of consideration.

These four all take possession of things, and the arrogant share the same burden—yet the more they cling to fullness below, the greater their loss.

*When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, retreat—this is the Way of Heaven.*

Emperor Xuánzōng says: When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, one should retreat to decline prominence—like Heaven’s Way of fullness and emptiness in season, thus there is no worry of decline.
○ Master Hé says: When a person’s deeds are accomplished and affairs established, if they do not retreat and avoid position, they will meet with harm—this is Heaven’s constant Way.
○ Like the sun at its zenith must move, the moon at full must wane, things at their peak must decline, and extreme joy turns to sorrow.
○ Master Bì says: The seasons cycle; achievement brings transition.
○ Master Hóng says: Cold and heat alternate, extremes return, yin and yang succeed one another—Heaven’s Way is thus. Yet the foolish in the world, once encountering change, once violating its name, cling to it for life, claiming it as their own, unaware of Nature’s subtle shifts or the hidden balance of fortune and misfortune. Thus, they inevitably sit and invite disaster, unable to preserve themselves.

Only the perfect person is otherwise: they treasure gold and jade yet do not prize them, dwell in wealth and nobility yet do not glory in them. All things that come and lodge upon them are like shadows gathering on the body—naturally unaware whether they belong to self or other. Thus, how could they cling to fullness as caution or measure sharpness as skill? Unless one attains the mystery of no-self, how could they align with this?

Heaven’s Way is vast, and nothing surpasses it.

**Chapter Ten: *Carrying the Vital Essence***

*Carrying the vital essence,*
Master Hé says: *Vital essence* means *soul and spirit*. Humans carry soul and spirit to live; they must nurture them.

Joy and anger disperse the soul,
Sudden fright injures the spirit.
The soul resides in the liver,
The spirit in the lungs.
Fine wine and rich foods
Harm the liver and lungs,
Thus, the soul remains tranquil, the spirit at ease—virtue is preserved, and life extended.

**Chapter Ten: *Carrying the Vital Essence* (Continued)**

**Master Pan says:**
The *arc* (魄) is the master of material form, yet the *spirit* (神) is vast and boundless, yet unaware of itself. The spirit always rides upon the *arc*, thus the spirit becomes constrained by the body—this is how the boundless becomes narrow, the free becomes obstructed.

Those who wish to learn this Way must first purify their *virtue* and *qi*, lest they be burdened by the body. Only then can the spirit ride upon the *arc* without being ridden by it, thus embracing *Oneness* and embodying the spirit.

I have often reasoned: When a person dies, some ascend while others descend, for they extinguish the spirit to serve the form, letting the spirit follow the *arc*, thus transforming into strange things in the dark. But those whose spirit remains whole—even if the *arc* is stagnant—will merge with the spirit and know no separation.

On the day of a sage’s death, the spirit does not follow the *arc*. At first, it merely rides upon it. Can one who embraces *Oneness* ever truly depart?

**Emperor Ming Huang says:**
At birth, the *arc* is formed—this is the beginning of life. Once born, the *arc* is yin and empty, while the *soul* (魂) is yang and full. The *arc* is yin and void, so one must constantly nurture and restore its yang. When yang fills the *arc*, it becomes the *soul*, and the *soul* moves—life is then complete.

*Oneness* means undivided. To restore yang and preserve life, one must not be tainted or mixed. Thus, one must embrace and guard the pure *Oneness*—how could it ever leave the body?

**Master He says:**
If a person can embrace *Oneness* and keep it from departing, they will endure. *Oneness* is the origin of the Dao, the essence of *Great Harmony*—thus it is called *Oneness*.

Spread throughout the world, *Oneness* brings clarity to Heaven, tranquility to Earth, and rectitude to rulers. Within, it is the heart; in action, it is conduct. In giving, it is *virtue*—all are named *Oneness*. *Oneness* means singular focus, without division.

**Master Bi says:**
*Carrying* means *dwelling*. The *arc* is where humans naturally reside. *Oneness* is their true nature. If one can dwell in their natural home, embrace *Oneness* with clarity, and never let it depart, then all things will come as guests.

**Master Pan says:**
*Oneness* is the number of *essence* (精). Though we do not speak of *essence*, we speak of *Oneness*—for guarding *Oneness* keeps the *essence* from scattering. Learning the Dao returns to restoring nature, restoring nature returns to embodying the spirit. The reason one cannot embody the spirit is that they chase externals and forget the root, replacing self with things, thus losing *essence* and spirit, sinking into foolishness.

The vital essences of yin and yang are *soul* and *arc*. The *soul* is yang and wanders, yet it halts within the body because the *arc* is its counterpart. The *arc* is yin and still—*stillness* is restraint. Thus, the student must first calm their *virtue* and *qi*, making the *essence* and *arc* tranquil and unified. When the *arc* is still, the *soul* is settled; when the *essence* is unified, the spirit is whole.

*Oneness* generates water, water is *essence*—at birth, humans gather spirit from *essence*, originally whole yet unaware, often scattering into confusion. This is called *Wangliang* (罔两): *Wang* means the spirit is unclear, *Liang* means the *essence* is divided.

*Zhuangzi* says: *"Do not shake your *essence*—this is called embracing Oneness."*

The spirit and *essence* are like fire and water—fire has no fixed form, yet it shines when nourished. The spirit is vast and formless, beyond artificial crafting; one must only preserve the *essence*. Like adding oil to fire to brighten it, or nourishing roots to grow leaves—when *soul*, *arc*, and spirit are unharmed, the heart grows strong and *qi* flows smoothly, ungoverned by things.

In stillness, one embodies the Dao; in action, one aligns with principle. Refined to its utmost, one merges with the spirit, transcending the four names. This is the utmost necessity for the student—all ages of sages sought it within, not without. Can you concentrate your *qi* to such gentleness as a babe?

**Emperor Ming Huang says:**
Concentrate the pure *qi*, attaining harmony and softness, like a babe with no distinctions—then the spirit will not stray.

**Master He says:**
Concentrate and guard the *essence* and *qi* so they do not scatter, then the body will respond with softness. Like a babe, free of thought and affairs, the spirit will not depart.

**Master Bi says:**
*Concentrate* means *commit*. *Attain* means *fulfill*. To commit to natural *qi* and fulfill supreme softness—like a babe with no desires—then all things are whole, and nature is realized.

**Master Xiu says:**
Humans have three aspects: *essence* (精), *spirit* (神), and *qi* (气). If *essence* is whole, the *spirit* is whole; if the *spirit* is whole, it can command the *qi*.

When the *spirit* weakens and cannot command the *qi*, the *qi* acts erratically, leading one astray. *Mencius* says: *"The will is the commander of *qi*."* Yang Xiong says: *"Qi is the horse that carries good and evil."* If the commander is weak and the troops rebel, the army will perish. If the horse rages and the driver falters, the chariot will fail.

If the *spirit* cannot concentrate the *qi*, then joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are all governed by *qi*, sinking one into confusion—this is inevitable. The ancient scholars all understood this. If one has not yet reached this understanding, they must clear the heart to prevent it.

The three warnings of Confucius are all about guarding *qi*. Among his disciples, only Yan Hui could concentrate *qi*, thus he *"did not transfer anger."* Anger is the most violent expression of yang, and if one can resist transferring it, what else is this but concentrating *qi*?

Humans are born with sacred nature, yet their *qi* scatters and cannot be concentrated, so from maturity onward, they drift further from the Way. If one embraces *Oneness*, the *spirit* is whole; if the *spirit* is whole, the *qi* is soft; if the *qi* is soft, the true self is whole—thus they align with the babe.

*Concentrate* means to possess and wield authority. Purify and observe the mysteries...

He said: *"The River"* replied: One must purify the heart, making it spotless and clear. The heart dwells in the profound and obscure, perceiving all things—thus it is called *playing with the profound* (玄览). Can it be without blemish?

The *Bright Sovereign* said: *Playing with the profound* means the heart’s illumination. Blemish refers to flaws and defects. To purify and remove this illumination, making it serene and clear—can it be without flaws?

*"The River"* said: It means not indulging in evil.

*"Bi"* said: *Profound* is the ultimate of things. To say one can purify and remove false adornments, reaching the utmost perception, yet not allowing things to obstruct one’s clarity—if blemishes arise in the spirit, then one ultimately aligns with the *Profound*.

*"Pan"* said: If one can concentrate *qi*, the nature settles; if the nature settles, wisdom becomes clear; if wisdom is clear, one can then purge and remove to attain the profound perception of ultimate truth. Once this truth is illuminated, all worldly phenomena become the most wondrous. If one were to perceive even a single blemish, it would mean failing to recognize the truth.

**Loving the people and governing the state:**

*"The River"* said: To govern oneself is to cherish *qi*, thus preserving the body. To govern the state is to love the people, thus securing the nation. Can one achieve *wuwei*?

The *Bright Sovereign* said: To nurture the ten thousand people and administer state affairs—can one achieve *wuwei*? One must transform oneself from above. If one cultivates the spirit, all will follow in self-cultivation. When the body is cultivated, virtue is complete—thus one can be a ruler.

*"The River"* said: To govern oneself is to regulate breathing and vital *qi*, ensuring it is not heard by the ears. To govern the state is to bestow benevolence and virtue, ensuring the people do not know of it.

*"Bi"* said: To rely on extension to seek completion, or to manipulate fate to seek concealment—this is wisdom. To *play with the profound* without blemish is like abandoning sageliness. To govern without wisdom is like discarding wisdom. If one can abandon wisdom, then the people will grow perverse while the state thrives.

*"Pan"* said: As the above speaks of the Dao for oneself, then one can extend it to others. Laozi’s words focus on restoring nature. If one acts, it is not the way to let the people settle into their true nature. Though one may love and govern, one does not exalt action—this is the ultimate of the Way.

**The opening and closing of the Celestial Gate:**

*"The River"* said: The Celestial Gate refers to the Purple Forbidden Enclosure of the North Pole (北极紫微宫). Opening and closing refer to the two extremes of beginning and end. In governing oneself, the Celestial Gate refers to the nostrils—opening means panting, closing means breathing. Can one act like the female?

The *Bright Sovereign* said: The Celestial Gate is where fate and destiny emerge. Opening and closing refer to order and chaos. It speaks of the sovereign receiving the Mandate of Heaven—if one can guard the receptive and tranquil, one can then endure and complete one’s celestial blessings. Another interpretation: The *Yijing* says, *"One closing and one opening is called change."* The sage governs by responding to transformations without fixed methods, not relying on force but maintaining receptivity—like the Celestial Gate’s opening and closing, yielding to excess and supplementing with humility.

*"The River"* said: In governing oneself, one should be like the female—tranquil, gentle, and weak. In governing the state, one should respond harmoniously without dominating.

*"Bi"* said: The Celestial Gate is the path through which all under Heaven flows. Opening and closing mark the transitions between order and chaos. Whether opening or closing, it governs all under Heaven—thus it is called the Celestial Gate’s opening and closing. The female responds without dominating, acts without forcing—if one can act like the female in the Celestial Gate’s opening and closing, then all things will submit willingly, and all will dwell in peace.

*"Pan"* said: The perfected one has no intention in action; the spirit enters and exits, responding without dominating. As *Zhuangzi* says, *"There is something that takes it."* In autumn, Laozi’s virtue aligns with metal—still, unified, and restoring nature—thus his emphasis is as such. As for the *Yijing*, both Heaven and Earth, before and after, are nothing but the Dao.

**Bright and all-pervading:**

*"The River"* said: The Dao is bright like the sun and moon, pervading all under Heaven, extending to the eight extremes—thus it is said that one cannot see it, cannot hear it, yet it shines forth in all ten directions, radiant and brilliant. Can one be without knowing?

The *Bright Sovereign* said: If the sovereign can be receptive and tranquil, the myriad people will joyfully extol their virtue. Though bright like the sun’s fourfold illumination, one must still forget one’s deeds and not lord over others—thus, can one be without knowing?

*"The River"* said: There is none who can know the Dao’s fulfillment across all under Heaven.

*"Bi"* said: The utmost clarity and pervasiveness mean no confusion, no doubt. If one can act without contrivance, then all things transform naturally. This is the Dao’s constant *wuwei*—if lords and kings can uphold it, all things will transform of their own accord.

*"Xiu"* said: Principle has no need of knowing. Knowing is for responding to things. Once one knows ultimate truth, one naturally transcends knowing. Only by being without knowing can one truly know nothing. If one were to appear clearly as knowing, then it is ignorance. The mystery of being without knowing—how can it be called knowing?

I have often reasoned: The wise and the foolish, the saintly and the base—originally, they differ not. It is only because of folly that wisdom is revealed, and thus the name "saint" arises. The sage’s original heart—how could it ever have been self-consciously saintly? Thus, though bright and all-pervading, it initially knows nothing—this is the true knowing of the sage.

**To nurture and raise:**

*"The River"* said: The Dao gives birth to all things and nurtures them.

*"Bi"* said: It does not block their source, nor does it restrain their nature.

*"Pan"* said: If the Dao is complete as above, then creation and transformation lie within oneself, and one can nurture all things.

**To give birth without possessing:**

*"The River"* said: The Dao gives birth to all things, taking nothing for itself.

*"Pan"* said: The Dao and all things are always as one—who can possess them?

**To act without relying:**

*"The River"* said: The Dao’s actions are not done with expectation of reward.

*"Pan"* said: If one acts out of necessity, even if there is the deed of acting, one transcends it naturally—how could one then boast or depend on it?

**To grow without dominating:**

*"The River"* said: The Dao nourishes all things without carving or controlling them for use.

*"Pan"* said: If the Dao is as above, one can then nurture all under Heaven through *wuwei*. Though above all things, like a branch to its standard, how could there be the function of division or control?

**The Mysterious Virtue:**

*"The River"* said: The Dao is the mysterious virtue—when it acts, it cannot be seen. The Emperor Ming Huang said: Let all things follow their natural course, and nurture them accordingly. Do not claim credit for their growth, nor depend on the deeds you perform. Though you stand above all things, do not rule or dominate them. If a person can live thus, he attains the profound and mysterious virtue.

*"The River"* said: The Dao’s manifestation and the practice of virtue are unfathomable—one cannot see them. Yet, its teachings guide one to live in accordance with the Dao.

*"Bi"* said: If one does not obstruct their source, things will grow of themselves—what need is there for deeds? If one does not restrain their nature, things will flourish on their own—what need is there for effort? Things grow and mature naturally; they do not need to be shaped or completed by me. Virtue exists without a master—how else could it be called mysterious?

All who speak of the mysterious virtue possess virtue, yet also understand that its origin lies in the unseen and unfathomable.

*"Pan"* said: The mysterious is the ultimate essence of virtue. Once, Shun dwelled in the humble abode of *Xiao Wei*, yet the records say he heard of the mysterious virtue. Indeed, the highest virtue is always found in the state of no thought, no action. The meaning of this chapter centers on *wuwei*—though it speaks of growth, the virtue still bears the name of the mysterious. This chapter fully outlines the progression from the scholar to the attainment of divine insight and sainthood through self-cultivation.

**The Thirty Spokes Chapter (Eleventh):**
The thirty spokes converge at one hub.
*"The River"* said: In ancient times, a chariot had thirty spokes, following the cycles of the moon. All spokes meet at the hub, which contains a hole—thus, the spokes unite in their function. For cultivating oneself, one must eliminate emotions and desires, leaving the five organs empty and void, so that the spirit may return to them. For governing a state, one must be few in ability yet gather the many, weak yet sustain the strong. When the hub is empty, the chariot’s use is realized.

The Emperor Ming Huang said: This illustrates the interplay of presence and absence, of utility and reliance. The thirty spokes show the making of a chariot. The hub unites them, demonstrating how the few can govern the many. The axle and spokes exist, yet it is their emptiness that allows the chariot to move. If the axle and spokes did not exist, there would be no chariot to use. If the chariot’s center were not empty, the axle and spokes would be useless.

*"The River"* said: The emptiness is what allows the chariot to turn and carry people. The hub’s emptiness enables the wheel to rotate; the axle’s emptiness allows people to ride upon it.

*"Bi"* said: The hub can govern the thirty spokes because it is empty. It is through its emptiness that it receives all things—thus, it can use its solidity to unite the many.

*"Pan"* said: *Gong* (共) was originally written as *yòng* (用, "use"). To knead clay and shape it into vessels.

*"The River"* said: *Yán* (涎) means "to blend." *Zhǐ* (埴) is clay—soil. Blending soil to make vessels for drinking and eating. When the vessel is empty, its use is realized.

The Emperor Ming Huang said: *Yán* (埏) means "to blend." *Zhǐ* (埴) is clay—soil. The potter blends the soil to form jars and pots.

*"The River"* said: The emptiness within the vessel allows it to hold and receive things. To hollow out doors and windows to make a dwelling.

When the dwelling is empty, its use is realized.

The Emperor Ming Huang said: In ancient times, people hollowed out caves to make dwellings, and they also opened doors and windows—thus, it is called "hollowed."

*"The River"* said: The doors and windows are empty, allowing people to enter and exit, to see and be seen. The dwelling’s emptiness allows people to reside within it—that is its use.

*"Pan"* said: In all these three things—whether for movement, storage, or dwelling—their utility comes from what is not present. Thus, the presence of things brings advantage.

*"The River"* said: Advantage belongs to things. Advantage comes from their form and function—when vessels contain things, or dwellings hold people, one fears they may break or collapse. When the belly contains the spirit, one fears the body’s decay and destruction.

The Emperor Ming Huang said: The form is advantageous when there is emptiness; emptiness is advantageous when there is form. The Dao, above form, is called *Dao*. Form, below the Dao, is called *instrument/vessel*. To clarify the Dao’s ultimate utility, we use coarse forms to illustrate it—thus, we borrow the advantage of emptiness in the presence of things to show the advantage of the mysterious emptiness in the presence of things.

*"The River"* said: The power of emptiness allows it to contain and receive all things—thus, it is said that emptiness can govern solid form. The Dao is emptiness.

*"Bi"* said: Wood, clay, and jade are shaped into these three things, yet all derive their use from emptiness. When speaking of emptiness, the advantage of things arises—all things rely on emptiness for their utility.

*"Pan"* said: Emptiness is merely the opposite of presence; presence and emptiness depend on each other. Within emptiness, there is an ineffable presence whose utility is inexhaustible. The function of this ineffable presence is not like that of solid things, which have fixed forms and cannot respond to the infinite. Thus, it is only called "advantageous." Advantage belongs to the realm of *yin*—though this is the discussion of presence and emptiness, when pushed to its extreme, emptiness does not depart from presence, and presence is truly emptiness. Neither presence nor emptiness is the true ineffable presence.

**The Five Colors Chapter (Twelfth):**
The five colors make the eyes blind,

---

**The Chapter on Favor and Humiliation (Thirteenth):**

Favor and humiliation are like a startling shock,
**The Dao/Way** says: To grasp them brings trembling, to lose them brings sorrow—so long as one does not forget favor and humiliation, all are startled.

**He** said: The body is startled by favor, and startled by humiliation.
**Pan** said: The heart rejoices in seeing favor, yet what humiliation is greater than that?

To value great affliction as one’s own body,
**The Dao/Way** says: The body is the foundation of life—thus, one treasures and guards it as if it were a great affliction. These two lines state that to prize one’s body as if it were a great affliction is the same as saying to prize great affliction as one’s own body. For when one values the body, it is indeed the greatest affliction.
**He** said: *Guì* (noble/valued) is *wèi* (fear/reverence). *Ruò* (if) means *zhì* (to reach). To fear great affliction reaching the body—thus, all are startled.
**Pan** said: To value the body and burden the heart with it—then its affliction is great indeed. Just as one has a body, and every movement weighs upon it—what is favor and humiliation?
**He** said: Asking what is favor, what is humiliation. Favor is honor and glory; humiliation is shame and disgrace. Those who ask about it in relation to the body are doing so to enlighten others.
**Pan** said: The root of these words is the pair *ruò* (if) and *shèng* (startling)—this is incorrect. For if favor is what the world honors, how could it be considered humiliation? The question is posed to introduce what follows.
Favor is the lesser of the two.
**The Dao/Way** says: Earlier, it was stated that favor and humiliation are like a startling shock, lest people not understand—thus, it asks: What is meant by favor and humiliation? To receive favor and become proud and full of self-satisfaction is to invite disaster without fail. Thus, one knows that favor is the root of humiliation—hence the reply: Favor is the lesser of the two.
**He** said: Humiliation is lowliness.
**Xìu** said: To receive favor from others is to follow the Dao/Way of lowliness. Zhao Meng was able to humble himself because he was favored by others. All living beings inherently possess a true sovereign, sufficient to surpass the world, and a true ruler, sufficient to govern all things—but the foolish lose their noble virtue, pursue external objects for glory, and yield to the power of gain and loss. This power of gain and loss lies in the hands of others. My joys and sorrows depend on what I gain and lose—how could I not be early and deeply confused?

Startling arises from having love yet fearing loss, so the burden of receiving favor is like a startling shock.

Those who serve three times yet three times renounce office, without showing signs of joy or displeasure—are they not startled?
Who receives favor yet does not take pride in it, yet remains unhumiliated in their favor?

To gain it is like a startling shock,
**He** said: To be startled by receiving honor and favor is to be in a high position yet feel as if in peril—valuing one’s station, not daring to be proud, not daring to indulge.
To lose it is like a startling shock,
**He** said: To lose favor and fall into disgrace is to fear that greater calamity will follow. This is what is meant by: Favor and humiliation are like a startling shock.

**The Dao/Way** says: Favor and humiliation cycle endlessly; favor is the root of humiliation. All emotional entanglements and stagnations—even in humiliation—do not make one startled by favor. Thus, the Sage warns: When you receive favor, regard it as if you had received humiliation and were startled. Then, when you lose favor and suffer humiliation, it will be as if you had heeded my warning—when you receive favor, yet are startled and fearful.

「Hence, **He** concludes: This is what is meant by *favor and humiliation are like a startling shock*.

**Pì** said: Favor must bring humiliation, glory must bring woe—when one is startled by humiliation, the same applies to glory.
If a ruler below receives favor, humiliation, glory, and woe as if startled, then he will not be sufficient to disrupt the world.

**Wén** said: Because at the moment of gain or loss, one has a startled heart—this is why it becomes humiliation.

What is meant by *"the greatest woe is like one’s own body"*?
**Míng Huáng** said: He fears that people do not understand that one’s own body is the root of all woes, hence he asks.

**Hé** said: Why return to your own door and yet fear others like your own body?

**Pì** said: The greatest woe belongs to the category of glory and favor.
If life is cherished so deeply, it must lead one to the realm of death—hence it is called the greatest woe.
People are bewildered by glory and favor, yet they return to their own bodies—hence it is said that the greatest woe is like one’s own body.

**Xiù** said: The noble are above others yet possess a state—if they cannot forget it, then their woe is great indeed.
Compare it to a person having a body: cherishing it and burdening it with cares, then cold and heat, sickness and pain, all arise—is this not the greatest woe?

**Shì Nán Zǐ** said: **Yáo** did not cherish his own person, nor did he see his own person in others.
The noble cherish their own person, those favored see their own person in others—only the Sage can avoid these two pitfalls.
The reason I have the greatest woe is because I have a body.

**Míng Huáng** said: The body is an illusion, fundamentally without true substance. The woe arises from clinging to the notion of having a body, feeling its cold and heat, pain and pleasure—hence it is the woe of the body.

**Hé** said: The reason I have the greatest woe is because I have a body. I worry about its toil, ponder its hunger and cold, succumb to emotions and desires—then I meet with calamity and woe.

**Pì** said: This arises from having a body.
When I have no body,
**Pì** said: I return to the natural order.
What woe will I have?

**Míng Huáng** said: If one knows the **Dao/Way** of heaven and earth in harmony, all are not mine to possess; abandoning form and discarding wisdom, realizing that the body is not the body, and aligning with the Great Unity—then what woe will there be?

**Hé** said: If I had no physical body, and attained the **Dao/Way** naturally, rising lightly on clouds, entering and exiting without hindrance, merging with the **Dao/Way** in spirit—then what woe would remain?

**Wén** said: If all things are one with me, then I am in harmony with the **Dao/Way**’s mystery, and all changes are forgotten—woes of fortune and misfortune cease.
But the foolish cannot free themselves; they rely on form as their own, so wherever the body goes, woes arise at every step.

**Lǎozǐ** first illuminates the burdens of glory and favor, yet these burdens all stem from clinging to the body—hence he uses the analogy of the body to explain the noble, and then proceeds to the subtlety of transcending the body.
**Zhuāngzǐ** says: Forget what one should not forget, and do not forget what one should forget—this is called true forgetting, also clarifying this meaning.

But **Kǒngzǐ**’s principle of *"no-self"* aligns with this. Learning culminates here.
Yet what is called *"no"*—does it mean to abandon and discard? Only that having it without ever truly possessing it, then it will not burden.

Moreover, nothing is higher or greater than wealth and nobility. If one truly attains *"no"* while still possessing them, then the Sage’s way of saving the world is also without woe.
This is how one regards favor—nothing more.

Hence, the noble use their bodies for the world, as if they could entrust the world to them.

**Hé** said: The ruler cherishes his own body while demeaning others, wishing to be the master of the world—this may allow him to establish his rule, but not to endure long.

**Pì** said: With nothing to exchange for his body, it is said he is noble—this is how one can entrust oneself to the world.
He who loves does not harm his body with favor, humiliation, glory, or woe—then he can truly be the master of the world.

**Wén** said: The Sage has no body, so the land can only be entrusted to **Yáo** and **Shùn**. If one has a body and seeks to do so, then it becomes a burden.
If one has not yet reached *"no body"*, then only by honoring life and valuing its roots, without exchanging oneself for external things, can one be as if entrusted to the world.
The noble do not humiliate their bodies; those who love do not endanger their bodies.
The disciples of **Zǐzhōu Zhīfù** and **Wángzǐ Sǒu** are examples of this.
If these two were like this, would they not have cherished their favor and burdened their nobility?

One text reads: *"This is how one can entrust the world"* and *"This is how one can entrust the world"*—this is **Wáng Bì**’s adoption of the *Nán Huá* text as definitive.
It is not so.

[From] *"Viewing it, one does not see"*—Chapter Fourteen of the *Zhuāngzǐ*.」

**"Viewing it, one does not see"**—its name is **Yí** (平易).
**Míng Huáng** said: This is the **Way of Illumination**.
Yí means **plain and easy**. The Way is not a color, so it cannot be seen.
Yet within the formless, it manifests as color—thus it is named **Yí**.

**Hé** said: **"Formless"** is called Yí—meaning it lacks hue and cannot be seen by the eye.

**Xiù** said: When the Way reaches **equanimity among all dharmas**, there is no high or low—it is beyond what the eye can perceive.

**"Listening to it, one does not hear"**—its name is **Xī** (希).
**Míng Huáng** said: Xī means **subtle**, the faintest of sounds.
The Way is not a sound, so it cannot be heard.
Yet within the silent, it alone harmonizes—thus it is called **Xī**.

**Hé** said: **"Soundless"** is called Xī—meaning it has no resonance and cannot be heard by the ear.

**Páng** said: When things interact, sound arises.
The Great Way does not dwell among phenomena—when sought with the mind, it is already distant, hence **Xī**, as the *Classic* calls it **"Great Sound."**

**"Grasping it, one does not attain"**—its name is **Wēi** (微).
**Míng Huáng** said: *Bó* means **to hold**; Wēi means **subtle**.
The Way has no form, so it cannot be grasped.
Yet within the formless, it acts upon things—thus it is named **Wēi**.

**Hé** said: **"Formless"** is called Wēi—meaning it has no substance and cannot be seized by the hand.

These three cannot be **exhaustively defined**,
**Hé** said: The three—**Yí, Xī, Wēi**—are without color, sound, or form.
Words cannot describe them; script cannot transmit them.
They must be **received in stillness**, sought with the **spirit**—they cannot be questioned and obtained.

Thus, they **merge into One**.
**Míng Huáng** said: The three are used to **explicate the Way**, but the Way is not sound, color, form, or law—
so explications cannot be fixed; only **Yí, Xī, Wēi** remain.
The Way is not **Yí, Xī, Wēi**, so it **merges back into One**.

**Hé** said: *Hùn* means **to unite**.
Thus, though united in three, it is named **One**.

**Bì** said: Without shape or image, without sound or echo,
it can **pervade all** and **go everywhere**—
yet it cannot be known.
Thus, naming it with my ears and eyes as "unknown," it cannot be exhaustively defined—
it **merges into One**.

**Páng** said: The three are originally **One**, yet people seek it
sometimes with sight, sometimes with hearing, sometimes with touch—
thus names are assigned according to circumstances.
Though the means of seeking and the object sought are never truly separate,
only when one **realizes Oneness** does it **naturally merge with the One**.

Its **upper** is not **bright**,
**Hé** said: The One in the heavens is not **dazzlingly luminous**.

Its **lower** is not **obscure**.
**Míng Huáng** said: Above, it must be clear; below, it must be dark—
yet the Way, though above, is not above, and though below, is not obscure.

**Hé** said: The One in the world is not **dimly hidden**.

**Xiù** said: All things have substance, thus they possess **yin and yang**—
above, bright; below, dark—this is their necessary nature.
Only the Way, without substance, **naturally merges**—this is the fixed nature of the Way.
The *Zhuāngzǐ* says:
*"Those who lose their Way see light above and become earth below."*

It is **endlessly dynamic**—**unnameable**,
**Hé** said: *Shéngshéng* means **endless motion**.
Unnameable—it is not a single color, so it cannot be distinguished by **blue, yellow, white, or black**.
It is not a single sound, so it cannot be heard as **gong, shang, jiao, zhǐ, or yǔ**.
It is not a single form, so it cannot be measured by **length, shortness, size, or smallness**.
It **returns to the formless**.

**Míng Huáng** said: *Shéngshéng* means **uninterrupted motion**.
Neither bright nor obscure, its motion is endless—
the function of giving birth to things is **unnamable**.
It is not that things create things; rather, it **constantly generates yet never begins with things**.
Its subtle origin is **profoundly still**—thus it is said to **return to the formless**.

**Hé** said: *Wù* means **substance**.
It must return to **without substance**.

**Páng** said: The Way has **constant measure**, its principle is reliable—thus it is called *shéngshéng*.
Though measured, it has no fixed form—thus it is **unnameable**.
At its utmost, it **never begins with things**—it is **perfect, beyond addition**.

This is called **"the state without state."**
**Hé** said: The One has **no form**, yet it **gives form to things**.

**Páng** said: **Being yet unseen**.

**"The image without image,"**
**Hé** said: The One has **no substance**, yet it **establishes forms for all things**.

**Bì** said: If one says it is **without**, yet things arise from it;
if one says it is **with**, yet its form is unseen—
thus it is called **"the state without state, the image without image."**

**Páng** said: **Being yet unattainable**.

This is called **hūhuǎng** (惚恍).
**Míng Huáng** said: This is the **state without state, the image without image**—
it cannot be named **being**, nor **non-being**.
Non-being is difficult to name—thus it is called **hūhuǎng**.

**Hé** said: The One is **flickering, elusive**—as if present, as if absent—**invisible**.

**Bì** said: It cannot be **fixed**.

**Páng** said: *Hū* is **being doubted as non-being**.
*Hǎng* is **non-being doubted as being**.
The Way, as a thing, is **neither being nor non-being**—it cannot be definitively named.

**Approaching it, one does not see its head,**
**Hé** said: The One has **no beginning or end**—it cannot be anticipated.
**Abandon passions, discard desires**—it **naturally returns to itself**.

**Following it, one does not see its tail.**
**Míng Huáng** said: It has **no beginning**, so approaching does not reveal its head.
It has **no end**, so following does not reveal its tail.

**Hé** said: The One has **no trace of advance**—it cannot be **fixed upon**.

**Páng** said: Things have **fixed forms**, thus they have **front and back**.
The Way, without form, has **no head or tail**.

This text speaks of the **Dao’s** operation—
thus it may be **welcomed and followed**.
Though it says **welcomed and followed**,
the **welcoming and following** lie within **things**,
yet the **Dao** itself has never differed.

To grasp the **Dao of antiquity**,
and use it to govern the **being** of the present.

**Míng Huáng** said:
To grasp the **Dao of antiquity’s** non-action,
and use it to govern the present’s **actions of being**,
then one **returns to simplicity and purity**.

**Hé** said:
The **Sage** grasps and upholds the **Dao of antiquity**,
holding to the **One** to govern **things**,
knowing that in the present there must be **being**.

**Bì** said:
There is **being**—there are **its affairs**.

**Páng** said:
The **Dao of antiquity** refers to the **Dao** that is **always One** through past and present,
and since it is **always One** through past and present,
it can govern the **ten thousand changes** of worldly affairs.

Can one know the **beginning of antiquity**?
**Páng** said:
**Extend it upward**—
until one reaches the **initial beginning of the beginningless**,
then one knows that **things** have **no origin**,
and thus the **nature of the Dao** is attained.

This is called **Dao’s principles**.
**Míng Huáng** said:
To know the **beginning of antiquity’s** practice,
this is called the **fundamental framework of Dao’s transformation**.

**Hé** said:
If a person can know the **origins of high antiquity**,
where **being** first emerged as **One**,
this is called knowing the **principles of the Dao**.

**Bì** said:
That which is **formless and nameless**,
is the **root of the ten thousand things**.

Though past and present differ,
and times change with customs,
still none fail to follow this,
to achieve their **governance**.

Thus one may grasp the **Dao of antiquity**,
and use it to govern the present’s **being**.

High antiquity, though distant,
its **Dao** remains—
so though in the present,
one can still know the **beginning of antiquity**.

**Páng** said:
The **essence of Dao’s principles**,
that which does not change between ancient and modern,
is what **Zhuāngzi** called the **beginningless framework**.

#1 Original text had "比" (*bǐ*), corrected to "此" (*cǐ*).

**Chapter Fifteen: The Virtuous Scholar of Antiquity**

The virtuous scholar of antiquity—
**He** said: *[This refers to] one who attains the Dao as a sovereign.*

**Subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,**
**He** said: *"Mysterious"*—this is Heaven. *[It describes] one whose resolve is profound and mysterious, whose essence communicates with Heaven.

**Exploring what cannot be known.**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"Scholar"* means *"to serve."* *[It speaks of] those in antiquity who took the Dao as their service—
toward those subtle and mysterious teachings of the Way,
none escape their profound insight and illumination,
yet their virtue and bearing are deep and unfathomable,
beyond recognition.

**He** said: The Dao’s virtue and power are profound and distant,
beyond recognition.
Within, it seems as though blind;
in reverse, it seems as though deaf—
none know its excellence.

**Need** said: *"Scholar"* is the name for serving the Dao—
subtle and mysterious,
profound and penetrating.
With this Dao, one retreats and hides in secrecy.
Secrecy is the innate nature within,
so nothing advances to be seen.
Those of their time who were scholars
differed from this,
thus they are called the virtuous scholars of antiquity.

Only because it cannot be known,
do they forcefully embody its form.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: Only because virtue and measure are difficult to recognize,
do they forcefully embody its form to make it clear—
referring to the following passage.

**Solemn, as though crossing a winter river.**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"Solemn"* means *"leisurely and composed."*
The virtuous scholar, in his composed state,
is like crossing a winter river—
others value [his caution],
so he fears and is wary.
Now, I am unstained,
so I am composed.

**He** said: When undertaking matters, he weighs them gravely,
hesitant, as though crossing a winter river—
his heart resists it.

**Bi** said: Crossing in winter,
composed as if desiring to cross,
yet as if not desiring to cross—
his true intent cannot be seen in his expression.

**Pang** said: *"Solemn"* means preparing in advance and warning oneself.
The Perfect One has no concern for things,
only when pressed does he act.
Crossing in winter—
approaching matters with caution,
as if unavoidable.

As *Zhuangzi* says: *"He does not engage in affairs."*

**Doubtful, as though fearing the four neighbors.**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"Doubtful"* means *"hesitant and uncertain."*
Earlier, it spoke of the virtuous scholar being unstained, thus composed,
yet when observing his actions,
he is deeply hesitant—
like a common man fearing neighbors and being cautious.

**He** said: His advance and retreat are hesitant,
as though bound by constraints,
fearing the four neighbors would know—
like one who has broken the law.

**Bi** said: The four neighbors unite to attack the central sovereign,
yet he remains uncertain of his direction.
The virtuous one’s beginnings and signs are unseen,
his virtue’s path is invisible—
just as this.

**Pang** said: Though without warning, he still warns himself—
day by day, the Perfect One is serene, secret, and deep,
never leaving his innate dwelling,
thus he always seems to fear neighbors,
restraining his conduct without excess.

**Solemn, as though a guest.**
**He** said: Like the bearing of **Yóuyú** the Perfect One,
solemn and without contrivance.

**Pang** said: He does not take affairs as his own responsibility,
so his bearing is tranquil.

**Dissolving, as though ice about to melt.**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: Though solemn and composed,
without contrivance,
yet he does not cling to things—
dissolving, like spring ice releasing.

**He** said: *"Dissolving"* means dispersing,
*"releasing"* means vanishing.
Abandoning emotion and desire,
this is called emptiness and void.

**Pang** said: At the beginning of life,
one is like the great void—
congealed into our form,
like water becoming ice.
Thus, for the Dao, there is ice that melts and thaws—
when matters reach this point,
his bearing no longer clings to one form,
dissolving as though about to release.

**Examining it further:**
Human nature is like water,
congealed by transformation,
so it becomes rigid and blocked.
The *"releasing"* returns to its origin.

**Thick, as though uncarved wood.**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: Though dissolving like melting ice,
he does not boast of himself,
yet remains sincere and thick—
like uncarved wood, without distinction.

**He** said: *"Thick"* means substantial and solid,
*"uncarved"* means form not yet divided—
within, guarding the spirit,
without, lacking ornament.

**Xiu** said: Before becoming an instrument, it is called *"uncarved"*—
a metaphor for the completeness of nature.
After ice melts,
only then can one preserve the fullness of Heaven’s nature,
without artificiality,
thus it is like uncarved wood.

**Vast, as though a valley.**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: His virtue and measure are vast and broad,
containing all without exception,
like a valley’s capacity.

**He** said: *"Vast"* means spacious.
*"Valley"* means empty and void—
without virtue, deeds, or fame,
yet encompassing all.

**Pang** said: Nature is complete and unharmed,
yet does not possess its completeness,
thus vast and empty—
like a valley’s reception and response.

**Mingled, as though turbid.**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: Harmonizing light, advancing naturally,
like turbidity yielding clarity.

**He** said: *"Mingled"* means preserving the original truth,
*"turbid"* means not brightly illuminated.
Blending with the multitude, not self-exalting.

**Bi** said: All these *"as though"* comparisons
speak of forms and symbols
that cannot be named or shaped.

**Pang** said: Water’s nature is originally clear,
yet turbidity arises from mingling with things.
If one does not purify oneself of things,
one becomes mingled, like turbid water.

**Who can turbid it and then still it,
gradually clarifying?**

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"Who"*—who can, in that turbid state,
still it and settle it,
so that it gradually clarifies?

**He** said: *"Who"*—who can, like turbid water,
still it, gradually clarifying.

**Pang** said: Clarifying nature is like clarifying water—
if forced, it stirs and becomes more turbid.
Only through stillness can it gradually clarify.

The scholar of the Dao
is why nothing can turbid him—
because his stillness gradually clarifies.

**Who can settle it and then move it,
gradually bringing forth life?**

**Emperor Minghuang** said: Who can remain settled in this clarity for long,
then seek superior methods,
moving and cultivating,
so that the nature of clarity and stillness
does not stagnate in doctrine,
but gradually emerges in motion?
*"Life"* means emerging in motion.

**He** said: Who can remain settled for long,
gradually nurturing longevity?

**Bi** said: *"Obscure"* by applying Dao to things, one attains clarity;
*"Turbid"* by stillness, one attains purity;
*"Settled"* by movement, one attains life—
this is the Way of Nature itself.
*"Who can"*—this speaks of its difficulty.
*"Gradually"* means meticulous care.

**Pang** said: Returning to stillness and quiescence,
responding yet remaining unobstructed,
thus life emerges gradually,
and the end becomes a new beginning.
If life emerges gradually through movement,
then change is ever in motion—
nothing can halt it.
Whoever does this
truly follows the principles of yin and yang,
rides the flow of Nature,
and acts without contrivance—
thus all is spoken of as *"gradual."*
To speak of turbidity is to know how to settle into clarity;
to speak of settling is to know how to move into turbidity—
this aligns with the subtle language of the previous section.
Those who preserve this Dao
do not seek fullness.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: To preserve this gradual clarity and gradual life,
one must hold to nothing rigidly.
If one clings to clarity while seeking life,
this is called *"fullness"*—
and one will lose this Dao.
Hence, it is said: *"Do not seek fullness."*

**He** said: To preserve this gradual life,
one must not indulge in excess or overflow.

**Xiu** said: *"Not-full fullness"* is true fullness.
After attaining the Dao,
if one claims possession of it,
this is to have severed oneself from the Dao—
far from its path.
Only the not-full
can endure without decay,
without clinging to novelty.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: Only those who do not seek fullness
can truly embody it—
their actions are worn yet unobstructed,
not hindered by clinging to the new.

**He** said: Only those who do not seek fullness
can guard against decay without pursuing novelty.
Decay is the concealment of brilliance;
novelty is the pursuit of fame.

**Pang** said: The Dao has no fixed form,
cannot be contained by any vessel.
When applied, it overflows;
when sought, it eludes—
thus those who follow the Dao are never full,
yet their use is inexhaustible.
Those who attain the Dao are never full,
so those who perfect it are never novel.
The Dao’s function
permeates all things without decay,
for its lack of decay
means no novelty can be established or ruined.
Decay arises from novelty;
ruin arises from completion.
Though a scholar may perfect the Dao,
they must always appear decayed and ruined.
If, at the Dao’s outset, one prizes its novelty,
this contradicts the Dao’s intent—
not true perfection.
The Classic says:
*"Great perfection seems deficient—
its use is unexhausted."*
This passage, sentence by sentence, leads to completion,
yet completion seems like decay—
thus it is fulfilled.

**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Supreme Void**

**He** said: Those who attain the Dao
diminish emotions, abandon desires,
their five viscera pure and still—
reaching the supreme void.

**Guard stillness with sincerity.**

**Emperor Minghuang** said: The supreme void is the subtle origin.
It is said that when humans receive life,
they inherit this supreme void and subtle origin,
but once form takes in and expels,
the origin scatters.
Now, to restore the supreme void and subtle origin to the body,
one must utterly abandon worldly attachments,
guard this feminine stillness with sincerity—
then the Dao of the supreme void will naturally manifest in the body.

**He** said: Practice purity and stillness,
cultivate sincerity and depth.

**Bi** said: To attain the void is to reach the utmost sincerity;
to guard stillness is to grasp the true essence.

**Xiu** said: To attain the void, strive for the utmost;
to guard stillness, strive for depth.
For those who would observe the principles of things,
first attain unity.

The scholar’s affairs—
if excessive, they obstruct the Dao;
if active, they reveal true nature—
thus it is.

**All things arise together.**

**He** said: *"Arise"* means *"life."*
All things arise in life.

**Bi** said: Movement, action, growth, and flourishing.

**Pang** said: All things emerge from the void and stillness,
then return to the void and stillness—
the changes of spring birth and autumn death make this clear.
I observe their return.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: The Daoist Master says:
*"How do we know that guarding feminine stillness can attain the supreme void?"*
Observe how all things move and act—
when they return, they always rest in stillness—
thus it is known.

**He** said: I observe all things,
and see that none fail to return to their origin.
Humans should reflect deeply on their roots.

**Bi** said: By observing void and stillness,
one sees their return.
All that arises from the void,
all movement from stillness—
though all things arise and act,
they ultimately return to the void and stillness—
this is the utmost sincerity of things.

**Pang** said: Void and stillness bring clarity;
clarity reveals principle.
To perceive principle is not to cling to form—
rather, to observe the true nature of return.

**All things flourish abundantly,**
**He** said: *"Flourish abundantly"* means *"luxuriant growth."*
Each returns to its root.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: Again, it is said that all things return to stillness,
for luxuriant growth—
their life nature returns to the root.
Thus, those who speak of luxuriant growth as movement,
see that when they return, they rest in the root.
Speaking of things flourishing in movement,
when they return, they all rest in their origin.

**He** said: It is said that all things wither and fall,
each returning to its root to regenerate.

**Bi** said: Each returns to its beginning.

**Pang** said: *"Return"*—
returning to innate nature, returning to functional use,
returning to the root of nature.
Though plants and animals differ,
their principles converge in unity.

**Returning to the root is stillness.**
**He** said: *"Root"* refers to the foundation—
the root is settled, gentle, and weak,
humble and lowly—
thus it does not perish.

**Stillness is returning to one’s essential nature.**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: Luxuriant growth returns to its root,
then rests in stillness.
If humans return to the root in utmost stillness,
this is called restoring their inherent nature and vitality.

**He** said: Stillness is returning to one’s essential nature and vitality,
so that one does not die.

**Pang** said: There is a nature of life,
nature is bestowed by vitality,
and vitality exists before life begins—
the complete essence of the Dao.
The *Classic* says:
*"Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, and reach vitality."*
Observing return is exhausting principle;
returning to the root is fulfilling nature;
returning to vitality is reaching vitality—
reaching vitality is the utmost,
yet it does not depart from nature.

**Returning to vitality is the constant way.**

**He** said: Returning to vitality prevents death—this is the Dao’s eternal practice.

**Bi** said: Returning to the root brings stillness, hence *"stillness."* Stillness returns to vitality, hence *"returning to vitality."* Returning to vitality attains the constancy of nature and vitality, hence *"constant."*

**Pang** said: Birth brings entry into existence; existence binds one to fate. Thus, the subtle transformations of fate shift without pause, moment by moment. Only returning to vitality remains serene and eternally tranquil—nothing can alter it.

**Knowing constancy is clarity.**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: Guarding stillness and returning to vitality is to possess constancy. Knowing how to guard constancy brings yet greater clarity.

**He** said: To know the Dao’s eternal extremes is to be clear.

**Pang** said: What is known as not-constant is not true knowing. The sage values clarity above all—it is self-realization alone. Ignorance of constancy leads to reckless action and calamity.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: If one does not steadfastly uphold virtue, they may suffer the shame of ancestral sacrifices—departing from constancy and acting recklessly leads to utter ruin.

**He** said: Not knowing the Dao’s eternal practice, yet acting cunningly and deceitfully, loses divine insight—hence, calamity.

**Bi** said: Constancy, as a thing, is neither partial nor exaggerated—it lacks the states of brilliance or obscurity, warmth or cold. Hence, knowing constancy is clarity. Only this returning encompasses all things without exclusion. Losing this, evil invades one’s portion, and things stray from their place. Thus, not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and calamity.

**Pang** said: Not attaining the extremes of nature and vitality, one takes all forms and colors as real, giving rise to deluded emotions. Engaging with them only deepens confusion—through countless ages, one never awakens. The disasters of yin and yang are most dire.

**Knowing constancy is inclusivity.**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: Knowing to guard true constancy makes the mind and environment tranquil, like an empty valley—it contains all things without exclusion.

**He** said: Knowing the Dao’s eternal practice removes emotions and desires, encompassing all without exclusion.

**Bi** said: It encompasses all without exception.

**Pang** said: Knowing constancy reveals flawlessness—what cannot it contain? Inclusivity is impartiality.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: Containing all things without agenda, free of private bias, is true justice.

**He** said: Without exclusion in inclusivity, governance is impartial and without favor.

**Bi** said: Encompassing all without exception leads to boundless fairness.

**Pang** said: With no distinction between self and other, what private interest remains? Impartiality is sovereignty.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: Those who act with perfect justice and no favor are where all things turn.

**He** said: Impartial governance without favor is the way to rule the world.

**Bi** said: Boundless fairness reaches everywhere without omission.

**Pang** said: Inner impartiality leads to outer sovereignty. Sovereignty is heaven.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: When all things joyfully follow, like heaven’s embrace, one aligns with heaven’s virtue.

**He** said: To merge sovereign virtue with divine insight is to harmonize with heaven.

**Bi** said: Encompassing all without omission leads to unity with heaven.

**Pang** said: The sovereign is the ultimate of human Dao. Attaining human Dao merges with heaven. Heaven is the Dao.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: Sovereign virtue like heaven enables the Dao’s practice.

**He** said: Virtue merging with heaven aligns with the Dao.

**Bi** said: Merging virtue with heaven, embodying the Dao’s boundless flow, reaches the utmost emptiness.

**Pang** said: Only through the Dao does one accompany heaven. Accompanying heaven fulfills the Dao—who can distinguish whether it is heaven or humanity? The Dao is enduring.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: The Dao’s practice throughout the world brings lasting blessings.

**He** said: Aligning with the Dao brings enduring longevity.

**Bi** said: Attaining the emptiness of things, one grasps their constancy—reaching the utmost extremes.

**Pang** said: This is called *constancy.* The body perishes without peril.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: Aligning with heaven and practicing the Dao, one’s death is like the heavens’—eternal, without danger or harm.

**He** said: Able to be impartial and sovereign, harmonizing with heaven and the Dao, the four virtues are complete. Virtue and the Way are vast and distant—no calamity or blame. One dies with the heavens and earth, without peril.

**Bi** said: As a thing, emptiness cannot be harmed by fire or water, nor destroyed by metal or stone. Applied to the mind, rhinoceros and tigers cannot strike with their claws, nor weapons pierce with their blades—what danger could there be?

**Pang** said: Heaven and earth arise together; all things are one—who could harm them?

**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sovereign**
The Supreme Sovereign, the lower knows there is one.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: The Supreme Sovereign is the pure ancient ruler. The lower knows there is a sovereign above—revered like heaven, yet without imposed teachings or artificial governance. Thus, people lack virtue yet still praise them.

**He** said: The Supreme Sovereign refers to the Great Ruler, the nameless sovereign. The lower knows there is a sovereign above but does not serve them—simple and unadorned.

**Bi** said: The Supreme Sovereign is the Great Person. The Great Person is above, hence *"Supreme."* The Great Person acts without doing, teaches without speaking—all things act, yet none originate from them. Thus, the lower only knows there is one.

**Pang** said: Following the Three Sovereigns’ emergence, they governed without action, letting people naturally fulfill their roles without awareness. How could they be personally praised?

The next level: they are loved and praised.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: When virtue declines, the ruler practices benevolent teachings. Kindness is seen, hence loved; merit is high, hence praised.

**He** said: Their virtue is visible, their kindness worthy of praise—thus, they are beloved and praised.

**Bi** said: Unable to govern through *wuwei* and teach without words, they instead establish good deeds and transform the people, so that the lower ranks come to love and praise them.

**Pang** said: When governance yields clear results, the people cherish the ruler’s benevolence and remember their virtue. Though sufficient for temporary order, the ruler has already strayed from complete virtue, and the people have lost their natural alignment—thus, disorder begins. This is the rule of *ren* and *yi*.

The next level: they are feared.

**He** said: Laws and punishments are imposed to govern them.

**Bi** said: Unable to rely on benevolence and virtue, they instead depend on coercion and authority.

**Pang** said: This is the rule of laws and institutions.

The next level: they are scorned.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: When virtue further declines, the ruler enforces flawed policies, driving the people with punishments—thus, they are feared. When deceit fills their hearts and the ruler cannot discern it, they are scorned.

**He** said: With excessive prohibitions and burdensome decrees, the people cannot sincerely submit, hence they deceive and mock.

**Bi** said: Unable to govern with proper laws, they instead rule with cunning schemes. The people know to avoid them, and their commands are not obeyed—thus, they are scorned.

**Pang** said: When virtue is lost and governance fails, the people scorn the ruler. [Original text: *"One version reads: ‘fear and scorn,’ omitting ‘the next level.’"*]

When trust is insufficient,

**He** said: If the ruler lacks trustworthiness below, the people will respond with deceit.

There is untrustworthiness.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: Those who are feared and scorned—all stem from the ruler’s lack of trust, hence untrustworthy subjects arise.

**He** said: When the ruler lacks trustworthiness below, the people answer with untrustworthiness, deceiving their ruler.

**Bi** said: [Referring to] the ruler’s words.

When the body loses its nature, sickness arises.
When assisting things loses authenticity, flaws and strife emerge.
When trust is insufficient, untrustworthiness arises—this is the Way of Nature.
One’s own shortcomings cannot be remedied by cleverness.

**Pang** said: Mencius said: *"To have it within oneself is called trust."* The *Classics* say: *"Within it is trust; when people fulfill their nature, they do not stray from the constant Way—thus, it is called trust."* When the ruler governs apart from the Dao, it is not the natural essence, and thus trust is insufficient. When the ruler lacks trust, the people descend into deceit and falsity—hence, untrustworthiness arises. When the people are untrustworthy, great disorder begins.

*Yóu*—how precious are words!

**Emperor Minghuang** said: Those who are loved and praised—because the ruler’s words of virtue and teaching are precious, hence they are loved and praised.

**He** said: Speaking of the Supreme Sovereign, their actions are as precious as the sacred words, lest they stray from the Dao and lose naturalness.

**Pang** said: *Yóu*—the hesitation of *yóu*, meaning "not hasty," precious meaning "not lightly given." *Zhuangzi* says: *"Words are like wind and waves; the Sage speaks as if always doubtful, daring not to speak lightly, much less to act lightly."* The people are difficult to govern because their rulers act. Thus, the Sage hesitates.

[Original text: *"One version lacks the ‘yóu’ character—incorrect."*]

When achievements are complete and matters settled,

**He** said: Meaning the land is at peace.

The people all say, *"It was natural."*

**Emperor Minghuang** said: When achievements are complete yet not grasped, when matters are settled yet without action, the people use them daily without knowing how—saying it was natural. Thus, the Supreme Sovereign is known below.

**He** said: The people do not recognize the ruler’s pure virtue, instead believing it was natural for them.

**Bi** said: The beginnings and signs of naturalness cannot be seen, nor can its intentions be glimpsed. Nothing can replace its words—when words are spoken, there is response. Hence, *"Yóu—how precious are words!"*

They govern through *wuwei*, teach without words, and do not impose forms on things. Thus, achievements are complete and matters settled, yet the people do not know how.

**Pang** said: This is like guiding the good and distancing wrongdoing, yet no one knows who does it.

---
**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**

When the Great Dao declines, *ren* and *yi* arise.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: When purity is diluted and simplicity dispersed, the Great Dao does not prevail. Thus, *ren* and *yi* emerge, achieving small success.

When insufficiency breeds corruption, and when excessive governance sparks decay, yet the Sage’s intent to save the world remains unchanged—though the paths differ, they do not diverge entirely.

**He** said: In the age of the Great Dao, every family had filial children, every household had loyal and trustworthy individuals—*ren* and *yi* were not needed. When the Great Dao declined and evil arose, only then did *ren* and *yi* become teachings to be transmitted.

**Bi** said: Losing *wuwei*, they instead apply clever schemes to promote goodness—the Dao advances things.

When cleverness emerges, great falsity arises.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: Those who rely on cleverness are about to establish laws. When laws emerge, deceit follows—thus, great falsity arises.

**He** said: The clever ruler devalues virtue and prizes words, devalues substance and indulges in ornamentation. Below, they respond with great falsity and deceit.

**Bi** said: Using vigilance and clarity to detect deceit, things reveal their forms, and the people know to avoid them. Thus, when cleverness emerges, great falsity arises.

When the six relationships are fractured, filial piety and kindness arise.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: Father and son, husband and wife, brothers—these are the six relationships. When bonds are distant and ranks disordered, they are fractured. Over time, even relatives become like children, hence filial piety and kindness arise. All stem from straying from the Dao, thus partial names emerge.

**He** said: When the six relationships are severed and kin are not harmonious, only then do filial piety and kindness arise to nurture and care.

**Pang** said: In the age of supreme virtue, the people fulfill their nature—filial piety and kindness are not named, for they are the natural constant. Now, we still honor filial piety and kindness, yet it is because the six relationships are fractured.

When the state is in chaos and darkness, loyal ministers arise.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: In times of great peace, the ruler and subjects mutually suffice—what need is there for such names? But when darkness and disorder prevail, and the perilous governance is exposed, then loyal ministers emerge.

**He** said: When decrees fail to take effect, and ruler and subjects harbor mutual resentment, while ministers vie for power, then loyal ministers arise to rectify and rescue their sovereign.

**Bi** said: The most exalted names arise from great vice—this is what is called the "inner gate of beauty and evil."

The six relationships are father and son, brothers, and husband and wife.
If the six relationships are naturally harmonious and the state governs itself, then filial piety, kindness, and loyal ministers would be unknown in their existence.

Fish forget the Dao of rivers and lakes, then the virtue of mutual moistening arises.

**Pang** said: When governance is enlightened, who is not loyal? Who then is the loyal minister?

**Chapter Nineteen: The Chapter on Abolishing the Sage and Discarding Wisdom**

**Abolishing the Sage**
**He** said: To abolish the sage’s artifices and return to the origin, guarding the primal—all five emperors were thus. When Cangjie created writing, it was inferior to the Three Sovereigns’ knotted cords without script.

**Discarding Wisdom**
**He** said: To discard wisdom and cleverness, returning to non-action.

**The Chapter on Abolishing the Sage and Discarding Wisdom (continued)**

**The People’s Gain is a Hundredfold.**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: To abolish the Sage’s words and teachings, then transformation returns to non-action.
To discard the common man’s cunning and deceit, then the people become pure and simple.
Pure and simple, then artifice and falsehood do not arise; non-action, then arrogance and rivalry cease.
Man draws upon Heaven’s harmony, yet things lack Heaven’s nature—this is the hundredfold gain.

○ **He** said: Farming has no partiality.

○ **Pang** said: The people’s innate nature is pure and flawless; because they have lost their true essence and sunk into falsehood, the Sage therefore firmly establishes virtue and wisdom to serve as their ruler and teacher.
Yet the people, following the Sage’s virtue and wisdom, further stray without returning, ever more distant from their roots. Thus there is but a fleeting small remedy, yet ultimately the people lose their priceless simplicity.
To abolish and discard them, then the people return to their natural state—its benefits are incalculable.

**Abolishing Benevolence and Discarding Righteousness**
○ **He** said: To abolish benevolence’s display of favor, to discard righteousness’ emphasis on trustworthiness.
Then the people return to filial piety and kindness.

○ **Emperor Minghuang** said: To abolish the benevolence of universal love, to discard the righteousness of discriminating laws, then man returns to great filial piety and kindness.
○ **He** said: Virtue’s transformation is pure.
○ **Pang** said: In an age of perfect virtue, father and son naturally cherish one another—this is enough. Now, if benevolence and righteousness are further introduced, then names and realities become entangled, gains and losses confused, and the people’s nature is disordered.
For what flourishes at the end must decay at its root—this is the Dao of Heaven.
Filial piety and kindness are the root of benevolence and righteousness. Some say Confucius and Mencius followed the enlightened Dao of Yao and Shun, focusing solely on benevolence and righteousness, while others take Laozi as the standard—how do they compare?

He said: Summer thrives by birth and growth as its virtue, while autumn excels by gathering and conserving as its power. One leads to prosperity yet departs from the root, the other to withering yet returns to the essence.
The Dao is the seasons; the Sage is the timing. To understand the Dao, then Confucius and Laozi complement each other as beginning and end.

**Abolishing Artifice and Discarding Profit**
○ **He** said: To abolish artifice means to dispel deceit and falsehood, to disrupt the true.
To discard profit means to block the path of food, to close the doors of power.
Then thieves and robbers have no place.

○ **Emperor Minghuang** said: When man boasts of his one-sided talents, he harbors a heart of contention for profit, hence to abolish artifice means no contention, to discard profit means self-sufficiency.
Self-sufficiency, then he will not become a thief or robber.

○ **Pang** said: When artifice and profit prevail, the people’s desires grow extravagant, their basic livelihoods decay—this must lead to thievery.
These three matters—all injure the root through their end.

「River said: This refers to the three matters above that are discarded and abolished.
He deemed it insufficient in terms of **Daoist cultivation** (文).
River said: He deemed it insufficient in terms of **Daoist cultivation** because **Daoist cultivation** (文) was insufficient to guide the people.

○ **Pang** said: **Daoist cultivation** (文) is secondary to innate simplicity (質), and if the secondary prevails, it will be insufficient. This is how the people lose their true nature.
A passage mistakenly reads "文而未足" (insufficient in terms of **Daoist cultivation**), which is incorrect.
Hence, he commanded that there be proper alignment.

○ Emperor Minghuang said: These three matters must all be discarded and abolished, yet no method of **cultivation** (修行) was demonstrated. Therefore, he deemed that **Daoist cultivation** alone was insufficient to guide the people, and further commanded that there be something to adhere to—referring to the following four matters.
○ River said: It should be as in the next sentences.
○ **Pang** said: Align their true nature with the four matters below.
**Seeing simplicity and embracing purity** (見素抱朴),
River said: "Seeing simplicity" means holding fast to simplicity and upholding truth, not favoring artificial adornment. "Embracing purity" means revealing its natural simplicity, so it can be emulated.
○ **Pang** said: Not seeing external things but seeing one’s own true nature.
Simplicity (素) is the essence of nature, and man is born in stillness, unstained by all things, hence unadorned and simple.
In autumn, when the season arrives, all things return to stillness, their hue becoming white, in accordance with the **Dao** (天理).
Purity (朴) is the completeness of nature, taking purity as the foundation and outward forms as secondary.

**Few selfish concerns, little desire** (少私寡欲).
○ Emperor Minghuang said: Reveal the true simplicity, embrace genuine purity, reduce selfish inclinations and evil, and curb excessive cravings and demands.
○ River said: "Few selfish concerns" means to rectify and eliminate selfishness. "Little desire" means to know contentment.
○ **Bi** said: **Sagely wisdom** (聖智) is the excellence of talent (才). **Virtue and righteousness** (仁義) are the excellence of humanity (人). **Skill and profit** (巧利) are the excellence of practical application (用).
Yet it simply states "abolish," making the **Daoist cultivation** (文) seem insufficient. Without proper alignment, its intent cannot be seen. Hence, he said that these three matters were deemed insufficient in terms of **Daoist cultivation**, and so commanded that there be something to adhere to, aligning them with **simplicity, purity, and few desires**.

○ **Pang** said: Selfish concerns and desires are all actions of the self. Having a self means having external attachments, and if there are attachments, the foundation is lost.

**Chapter Twenty: Abolishing Learning and Having No Worries** (絶學無憂)
**Abolishing Learning,**」

「**River** said: To **abolish learning** (絶學) is not true; it does not align with the **Daoist cultivation** (道文).
**No worries** (無憂).

**Emperor Minghuang** said: To **abolish virtue/ren** (絶仁) is to reject **worldly learning** (俗學), thus preserving **primordial simplicity and purity** (淳朴). Few desires and little selfishness (少私寡欲) are why there are **no worries**.

○ **River** said: To eliminate **superficiality** (浮華) is to remove **worries and afflictions** (憂患).

○ **Xiu** said: Learning is a means to seek **returning to the primordial state** (復命). When one reaches the **primordial state**, there is no perception of **phenomena** (物), and thus no need for learning. When one attains the **Dao** in this manner, one avoids both **auspicious and inauspicious events** (吉凶), so who could have **worries**?

**Confucius** said: **Take joy in Heaven and know the Mandate** (樂天知命).
The greatest **worry** is having **knowledge and joy**; if so, it is not in accordance with the **Dao**.

How far apart are **"Yes" and "No"** (唯之與阿)? **River** said: Though they are both **responses** (應對), how far apart are they? The **Dao** (文) is swift yet **base in quality** (疾時賤質), while **worldly learning** (文) is slow yet **noble in form** (貴文).
How different are **good and evil** (善之與惡)?

**Emperor Minghuang** said: **"Yes"** (唯) is **respectful response**; **"No"** (阿) is **compliant response**. Though they come from the same mouth, they are said to differ greatly. **Respectful response** is good, while **compliant response** is evil—this illustrates **worldly learning**. To **abolish** (絶) is to have **no worries**; not to **abolish** is to invite **afflictions**. It depends on the **mind’s self-illumination** (心識回照), so how could they be far apart?

○ **River** said: Those who do good seek **praise** (稱譽), while those who do evil engage in **contention** (練爭). How different can they be? The **Dao** despises **flattery** (忠直) and employs **crafty sycophants** (邪佞).

○ **Pan** said: The **essence of the Dao** (道體) is fundamentally one. Yet when it descends to **perfection** (全), it further divides into **yin and yang** (陰陽), giving rise to **turbulence and strife** (扰扰起矣). All these distinctions stem from **delusive mind** (妄心). Illuminated by **Daoist truth** (道真), they are like **dreams and illusions** (梦幻).

Moreover, **"Yes" and "No"** (唯之與阿) both emerge from the mouth—**originally without distinction** (元無異狀)—yet the world perceives **"Yes"** as **respectful** (恭) and **"No"** as **compliant** (慢). From this arise **prejudice and anger** (是非喜怒), and **delusion and attachment** (情). If one seeks how they differ, what meaning could there be? **Good and evil** are also thus divided.

What people **fear**, one must **fear**.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: What ordinary people **fear** are **complacency** (慢) and **evil** (惡). What **virtuous individuals** (善士) **fear** are **worldly learning** (俗學) and **action-driven existence** (有為). Both must be **abolished**, hence one must **fear** them.

○ **River** said: A **Daoist practitioner** (道人) fears a ruler who does not **abolish learning** (不絶學之君). One must **fear** such rulers, for they **pursue fame and glory** (令色), **slaying the virtuous and the wise** (殺仁賢).

○ **Bi** said: The lower section states that **learners increase** (為學者日益), while **Daoists decrease** (為道者日损). Thus, **learners seek increase**, sharpening their **talent** (智) through what they can acquire. If one already has **few desires and contentment** (無欲而足), why seek **increase**? If one **does not know yet attains** (不知而中), why seek **progress**?

The **swallow and sparrow** have their **matches** (匹), while the **dove and pigeon** have their **enemies** (仇). Even **cold-region dwellers** (寒乡之民) must know of **fine furs** (旃裘)—this is **natural sufficiency** (自然已足). To **add to it** (益之) is to invite **worries**. Thus, **lengthening a hare’s legs** (續兔之足) is no different from **severing a crane’s wings** (截鶴之經). To **fear praise and seek advancement** (畏誉而進) is akin to **applying unusual punishments** (異刑).

**"Yes" and "No"** (唯阿) are **good and evil** (美恶)—how different are they? Thus, what people **fear**, I also **fear**, yet I dare not **rely on them** (恃之以为用).

○ **Pan** said: The **perfected sage** (至人) sees **no single thing** (一物), and thus **good and evil** (善悪) have no place. Yet they do not **discard** (廢) the world’s laws of **good and evil**, but simply **cast them off without burden** (洒然不累).

From *"How far apart are they?"* (自相去何若) onward, it clarifies that the **mind is unburdened** (無累). The **unburdened** are **originally not different from the world** (本不自異於世), hence all distinctions are shared with the people—**auspicious and inauspicious events** (吉凶) **breathe with the people** (與民同息).

Could the **sage** (聖人) **abolish burdens** (絶累) and **forget form** (忘形), thus **resting** (息)?

Yet the *I Ching* (《易》) has **auspicious and inauspicious symbols** (吉凶之象) because it **follows the people’s inclinations** (因民情).

**Zhuangzi** said: **Do not neglect humanity** (不忽於人), yet the **Dao encompasses both forgetting and being forgotten** (道既兼忘). It seems one should **neglect worldly affairs** (忽人事), but in truth, there is **no neglect**.

How **vast and boundless** (荒兮其未央) is the **Dao**!

**Emperor Minghuang** said: If one does not **fear abolishing worldly learning** (不畏絶俗學), then **all beings’ true nature** (眾生正性) will be **wasted and neglected** (荒废), and there will be **no end to it** (未有央止之時).

○ **River** said: Some argue that **ordinary people** (世俗人) are **chaotic and disordered** (荒乱), and thus they **pursue learning and cultivation** (進學為文) to **halt this chaos** (未央止).

○ **Bi** said: **Lamenting** the **distance between the Dao and worldly ways** (叹与俗相返之遠).

○ **Pan** said: **All transformations** (万化) **propel each other** (相推), yet **end in beginning** (終則有始), **eternally generating** (生生無盡)—how could there be an **end** (央)? Yet **worldly people** (世人) **fixate on phenomena** (物物), **judging them as good or evil** (為之美惡). Is this not **delusion** (惑)?

Only the **sage** (聖人) can **know the unity of all ages** (万古一時), **without gain or loss** (無得失) in their midst.

The **multitude** (眾人) **hurry and scurry** (熙熙),
**River** said: **Hurrying and scurrying** (熙熙) is **licentiousness and indulgence** (淫放), **overflowing with desires** (多情欲).

Like **feasting on the grandest sacrificial offerings** (享太牢),
**River** said: Like the **hungry longing for the finest sacrificial meats** (如饥思太牢之具), their **intentions are never satisfied** (意無足時).

Like **springtime ascending a viewing platform** (如春登台).
**Emperor Minghuang** said: The **multitude** (眾人) with **worldly learning** (俗學) and **action-driven existence** (有為) **hurry after sensory realms** (熙熙逐境), like **approaching a grand feast** (如享太牢) or **springtime ascending a viewing platform** (春台登望), **every movement sparks greed** (動生貪欲).

○ **River** said: **Spring** (春) is when **yin and yang harmonize** (陰陽交通), and **all things respond** (万物感動). To **ascend a platform** (登台) and **observe it** is to let **intentions run wild** (意志淫淫然).

○ **Bi** said: The **multitude** (眾人) are **bewildered by beauty and advancement** (迷於美進), **confused by honor and profit** (惑於榮利), and their **desires compete** (欲進心競). Hence, they **hurry like feasting on grand sacrifices** (熙熙若享太牢) and **ascend platforms in springtime** (如春登台).

○ **Pan** said: **Creation** (造化) is **boundless** (无极), and **things continuously arise** (事物日生). Only the **sage** (聖人) can **unify past and present** (一古今) **without change** (無變). The **multitude** (眾人) **follow transformations** (随化而迁), and upon seeing **good or evil** (美惡), they **take delight in life** (樂得其生), **considering it beautiful** (自以为美).

**Spring** (春) is when **all things emit vibrant sounds** (万物音張), **departing from stillness** (離静) and **beginning to move** (而動), a time when they **lose their root** (去本) and **chase superficiality** (逐末).

A **platform** (台) is a place from which one can **view distant realms** (远览诸境). Those who **do not grasp ultimate truth** (不明乎至理) all **follow phenomena** (逐物), **generating emotions** (生情)—such is their state.

**I alone remain tranquil** (我独怕兮), **yet no sign of emotion** (其未兆).
**River** said: **I alone remain tranquil** (我独怕), **serene and undisturbed** (安静), **with no trace of desire** (未有情欲之形兆), like an **infant before it becomes playful** (如婴儿之未孩).

**Emperor Minghuang** said: **I alone remain tranquil** (我独怕然安静), **with no form or trace of desire** (於其情欲，略無形兆), like that **infant** (彼婴儿), **not yet able to act childishly** (未能孩孺).

○ **River** said: Like a **child unable to answer a doll** (未能答偶人時).

○ **Bi** said: **I am vast and empty** (廓然), **with no shape to name** (無形之可名) and **no sign to point at** (無兆之可舉), like an **infant before it becomes playful** (如婴儿未能孩).

○ **Pan** said: **My nature is tranquil and unperturbed** (性体怕然不萌智虑), **harboring no stirring of cleverness or calculation** (含和守一), **in harmony with that infant** (同於婴儿).
The ancient text reads *"廓兮"* (kuò xī), but this is incorrect. *"怕"* (pà) and *"泊"* (bó) are the same; *"怕"* means **still and unchanging** (不流之义), while *"廓"* (kuò) is merely the name for **vast emptiness** (虚大之名). Examining the text’s meaning, it should follow *"怕"* (pà). **I drift, drifting** (乘乘兮若无所归).

**Emperor Minghuang** said: **The Perfect One has no heart** (至人无心), **moving with things yet taking nothing** (运动随物无所取与), like a **traveler with no destination** (若行者之无所归).
*"乘乘"* (chéngchéng) is the **form of motion** (运动貌).

○ **River** said: **I drift, drifting like a remote and desolate place** (我乘乘如穷鄙), **with no destination to seek** (无所归就).

○ **Bi** said: **Like one with nowhere to dwell** (若无所宅).

○ **Pan** said: **Drifting** (乘乘) means **riding along with all transformations yet without selfishness** (乘万物之变而不自私), thus **like one with no destination** (故若无所归). **It simply adapts to change** (盖唯变所适), **with no fixed direction** (无所向着).
One text reads *"儡儡兮无所归"* (lěilěi xī wú suǒ guī), but this is incorrect.

**The common people all have excess** (众人皆有余),
**Emperor Minghuang** said: **They indulge in dusty affairs** (耽嗜尘务), **boast of cleverness and skill** (矜夸巧智), **and claim to have abundance** (自为有余), **to display their brilliance** (以示光大).

○ **River** said: **The common people use excess wealth for luxury** (众人余财以为奢), **and excess wisdom for vain debate** (余智以为许).

○ **Bi** said: **They survey all things with pride** (矜览庶物), **so they always have excess** (故常有余).

But **I alone seem abandoned** (而我独若遗).
**Emperor Minghuang** said: **I am always as if lacking** (常若不足), **with some forgotten intent** (有所遗志).

○ **River** said: **I alone seem like discarded goods** (我独如遗弃似不足).

○ **Bi** said: **The common people have no heart without desires or aspirations** (众人无不有怀有志), **overflowing their chests** (盈溢胸心), **so it is said they all have excess** (故日皆有余).
**I alone am vast and empty, without action or desire** (我独廓然无为无欲), **as if lost** (若遗失之也).

○ **Bi** said: **I transcend yet self-destroy** (超然自丧), **not claiming what I possess** (不有其有).
**I am indeed the heart of the foolish** (我愚人之心也哉).

○ **River** said: **I do not follow the common people** (不与俗人相随), **steadfastly guarding the One** (守一不移), **like the heart of the foolish** (如愚人之心).

○ **Bi** said: **I sever the heart of the foolish** (绝愚人之心), **making no distinctions** (无所别析), **my intentions free of likes or desires** (意无所好欲), **yet my true nature remains unseen** (犹然其情不可睹), **thus I appear so abandoned** (我颓然若此).

**Pure, pure** (纯纯兮).
**Emperor Minghuang** said: **Am I truly the heart of the foolish** (我岂愚人之心), **abandoned like this** (遗忘若此哉)?
**My heart is simply pure** (但我心纯纯), **so it seems abandoned** (故若遗尔).

○ **River** said: **Without distinctions** (无所分别).

○ **Bi** said: **No distinctions to name** (无所别析，不可为名).

○ **Bi** said: **Pure, pure like the foolish yet the utmost of true wisdom** (纯纯兮似愚而真智之极). One text reads *"沌沌"* (dùndùn) instead of *"纯纯"* (chéngchéng).
The common people are **bright and clear** (俗人昭昭),
**Emperor Minghuang** said: **They boast of cleverness** (矜巧智).

○ **River** said: **They are clear and discerning** (明且达).

○ **Bi** said: **They flaunt their brilliance** (耀其光).

But **I alone seem dim** (我独若昏).
**Emperor Minghuang** said: **I conceal myself in obscurity** (自韬晦).

○ **River** said: **Like darkness and confusion** (如暗昧).

○ **Pan** said: **I forget both things and self** (物我兼忘), **not clinging to distinctions** (不主分别), **so I seem dim** (故若昏).

The common people are **sharp and keen** (俗人察察),
**Emperor Minghuang** said: **They establish laws and institutions** (立法制).

○ **River** said: **Sharp and keen means hasty and urgent** (察察，急且疾).

○ **Bi** said: **Distinctions mean separate analysis** (分别，别析).

○ **Bi** said: **They apply the bright and clear intent to governance** (推昭昭之意加之政), **and thus become sharp and keen** (则察察矣).

But **I alone am dull and slow** (我独闷闷).
**Emperor Minghuang** said: **I am only broad and magnanimous** (唯宽大).

○ **River** said: **Dull and slow means no cutting or severing** (闷闷无所割截).

○ **Bi** said: **They apply the dim intent to governance** (推若昏之意加之政), **and thus become broad and magnanimous, dull and slow** (则宽大闷闷然矣).
**Dull and slow means not seeking petty pleasures of the day** (闷闷谓不取日前小快).

**Vague, like the sea** (澹兮其若海).
○ **River** said: **I alone drift, drifting like the flowing of rivers and seas** (我独忽忽如江海之流), **no one knows their ultimate end** (莫知其所穷极).

○ **Bi** said: **Emotions are unseen** (情不可睹).

○ **Bi** said: **From tranquil yet unmanifest** (自怕兮未兆) to the arising of all things, **now it returns to the original nature** (而下有诸事物，及此又归於性本), **deep and vast like the sea’s accumulated waters** (湛然深广), **the nature of water complete** (水性全矣).

One text reads *"忽若晦"* (hū ruò huì), but this is incorrect.

**Gushing, like having no end** (飂兮似无所止).
**Emperor Minghuang** said: **My appearance is suddenly dim** (容貌忽然若昏晦), **yet my heart is serene** (而心寂兮), **cut off from worldly learning** (绝於俗学), **as if having no fixed end** (似无所止着).

○ **River** said: **I alone am light and airy** (我独漂漂), **like flying or rising** (若飞若扬), **with no end** (无所止), **my aspirations in the realm of the spirit** (志意在神域).

○ **Bi** said: **Without attachments** (无所系系).

○ **Pan** said: **Gushing like the sea** (飂兮若海), **speaking of the nature** (以言性体), **this then speaks of its function** (此则言其用), **rustling without obstruction** (飕然无所不通), **yet without fixation** (而无所系着), **what else could it be but its function** (非用而何).
One text reads *"寂"* (jì) instead of *"飂"* (liú), but this is incorrect.

**The common people all have purposes** (众人皆有以),

「Emperor Minghuang said: The common people, in the course of their lives, all have their own purposes, following the intentions of worldly learning and sensory experiences.

○ River said: *With purpose* (以), it means *to act with intention* (有为).

○ Bi said: *With purpose* (以), it means *to employ function* (用), all desiring to apply themselves to some use.

○ Pan said: When things are used by things, then they serve as *things* (物用). When things are used without being *used by things* (物於物), then they employ *things* (用物), yet nothing can truly *employ things* (物). But I alone am *unrefined* (顽).

○ River said: I alone am *without intention* (无为).

This seems *vulgar* (似鄙). Emperor Minghuang said: The *unrefined* (顽) means *without discrimination* (无分别), the *vulgar* (鄙) means *coarse and insufficient* (陋不足), yet my heart truly *enlightened and comprehends* (了悟). Though outwardly it may seem insufficient, hence the saying *like this* (似尔).

○ River said: The vulgar seems as if it does not reach (似若不逮).

○ Bi said: Without any desire to act, in a *stifled and dim state* (闷闷昏昏), as if recognizing nothing, hence the saying *I am unrefined and vulgar* (顽且鄙).

○ Pan said: Nothing can enter me, this may be called *unrefined* (顽). My perception seems as if I do not see, this may be called *vulgar* (鄙). One version reads *seems* (似) instead of *and* (且), which is also acceptable.

I alone differ from others.

○ Emperor Minghuang said: Others have *emotions and desires* (情欲), but I have no *attachment or defilement* (爱染). Others oppose the *Dao/Way* (道), but I align with it.

○ River said: I alone differ from others.

Moreover, I cherish *nourishment from the Mother* (食母).

○ Emperor Minghuang said: *Nourishment from the Mother* (求食於母) means to value oneself like an infant without need of external sustenance. Hence, the earlier passage says *like an infant before it can speak* (如婴儿之未孩), and the later passage says *thick with virtue* (含德之厚), comparing it to the *innocent child* (赤子). This is how I alone differ from others. The words *without seeking* (先无求) and *at both* (於两) were originally absent but are now added.

Furthermore, the *Sages* (圣人) in explaining the *scriptures* (经), originally did not avoid taboo words, but in teaching, there may be suspicions. The *principles* (理) are clear and the *original intent* (故义) cannot be altered, yet when facing the text, the phrasing must be stable and convenient. It is better to retain the ancient form while adapting to the present text.

Again, Sima Qian said: Laozi spoke over five thousand words, then *clarified principles and ceased speaking* (明理诣而息言), not establishing a fixed limit of five thousand words.

○ Bi said: *Nourishment from the Mother* (食母) is the *source of life* (生之本). All people abandon the *source of life* (生民之本), valuing only the *unadorned essence* (未饰之华), hence the saying *I alone desire to differ from others* (我独欲异於人).

○ Pan said: It is nothing but *pursuing things for nourishment* (逐物) and *taking sustenance from the Dao/Way* (取养於道), for the *Dao/Way* is the *Mother of all things* (万物之母). One version lacks the words *without seeking* (无求) and *at both* (於两), which is also acceptable.

Chapter Twenty-One: The Appearance of *Kongde* (孔德之容)

「The Yellow River said: *Kong* (孔) means vast. One with vast *virtue/power* (德) is boundless in all things, able to receive filth and turbidity, and dwell in humility. Only the Dao/Way is what one follows.

Emperor Ming Huang said: *Kong* (孔) means extreme. *From* (从) means to comply. If one asks how the *extreme virtue/power* (甚有德) person appears, it is said that their conduct follows only the Dao/Way of utmost emptiness.

○ The Yellow River said: *Unique* (唯) means alone. One with vast *virtue/power* (德) does not conform to the customs of the world but follows only the Dao/Way alone.

○ Bi said: *Kong* (孔) means void. Only by embracing voidness as *virtue/power* (德) can one then truly act and follow the Dao/Way.

○ Xiu said: *Virtue/power* (德) refers to the Dao/Way within oneself. When *virtue/power* (德) reaches its fullness, it merges with the Dao/Way, which cannot be contained. It manifests through *virtue/power*, which is selfless, and nothing but following the Dao/Way. The Dao/Way, as a phenomenon, is *vague and indistinct* (恍惚).

Emperor Ming Huang said: This describes the Dao/Way that the *Kongde* (孔德) person follows—neither having nor lacking, its essence is boundless and difficult to name, hence the saying *vague and indistinct* (恍惚).

○ The Yellow River said: The Dao/Way, in relation to all things, is *vague and indistinct* (恍惚), coming and going without fixed form.

○ Xiu said: The Dao/Way encompasses yin and yang. The subtlety of yin and yang—whether present or absent—is called *vague and indistinct* (恍惚). *Sudden and vague* (忽兮恍), within it there is form. The Yellow River said: The Dao/Way is *vague and indistinct* (恍惚) without shape, yet alone it serves as the model for all things.

○ Xiu said: One yin and one yang constitute form. Another version reads: *Sudden and indistinct* (忽兮恍兮). *Indistinct and sudden* (恍兮忽), within it there are things. Emperor Ming Huang said: *Things* (物) refers to the Dao/Way as a phenomenon mentioned above. From existence to return to nonexistence, it reverts to the Dao/Way, hence the saying *within it there are things* (其中有物).

○ The Yellow River said: The Dao/Way is *indistinct and sudden* (恍忽), within it there is one—nurturing transformation and creation, establishing *substance* (质) through *qi* (气).

○ Bi said: The Dao/Way begins things without form, yet does not cling to their formation. All things arise and are formed through it, yet they do not know their source, hence the saying: *indistinct and vague* (恍兮惚兮), *vague and indistinct* (惚兮恍兮), within it there are forms (象).

○ Pan said: One yang and one yin constitute things. *Vague and indistinct* (恍惚) refers to the subtlety of yin and yang, hence their ability to transform and create forms. Another version reads: *indistinct and sudden* (恍兮忽兮).

*Deep and dark* (窈兮冥兮), within it there is essence (精).

Emperor Ming Huang said: *Vague and indistinct* (恍惚) encompasses having and lacking, while *deep and dark* (窈冥) is unfathomable. Yet the essence of creation is exquisitely preserved.

○ The Yellow River said: The Dao/Way is *deep and dark* (窈冥), formless, yet within it there is essence (精)—the true brilliance of *qi* (气) and spirit (神) intermingling, where yin and yang converge.

○ Bi said: *Deep and dark* (窈冥) is the profound and distant deception. Profound and distant, yet unseen, yet all things arise from it. What is seen confirms its truth, hence the saying: *deep and dark* (窈兮冥兮), within it there is essence (精).

○ Pan said: Essence (精) is the beginning of things’ creation. Earlier, it was called *form* (象) of things—the Dao/Way’s concrete manifestation. Once the Dao/Way’s essence is complete, it generates myriad classes. The source of all things lies in the profound and unfathomable, hence the saying: *deep and dark* (窈兮冥兮).

Its essence is most true.

○ The Yellow River said: This speaks of the Dao/Way’s essence, *qi* (气), and spirit being profoundly true, without adornment.

○ Pan said: Essence (精) is the beginning of form. Essence is inherently true, yet it is further said to be *most true* (甚真) because things may lose their principles and essence, sinking into human artifice.

Within it there is trust (信).

Emperor Ming Huang said: The nature of *deep and dark* (窈冥) is fundamentally unadulterated. When things respond, they must do so, and their responses are never flawed, hence the saying *within it there is trust* (其中有信).

○ The Yellow River said: The Dao/Way conceals its function and hides its name; its trust lies within.

○ Bi said: Trust (信) means reliability. When things return to *deep and dark* (窈冥), the utmost essence is attained, and the nature of all things is fixed, hence the saying: *its essence is most true* (其精甚真), *within it there is trust* (其中有信).

○ Pan said: The essence of *deep and dark* (窈冥) generates myriad classes, yet each thing’s creation follows its own nature and measure, adhering to principles and forms. Once there is order and regulation, one can foresee without error, hence this is called trust (信).

*Zhuangzi* says: The formless has its portion. From ancient times to the present, its name does not vanish.

Emperor Ming Huang said: This refers to the Dao/Way, which from ancient times to the present generates all things. Things obtain their use from the Dao/Way, and their names are established through application. The use of creation, being the same from past to present, follows the Dao/Way’s application, hence its name does not vanish from ancient times to the present.

The Dao/Way is not thus.

○ Bi said: This is what was said above—how do I know that the beginning of all things is from nonexistence? It is known thus.

○ Pan said: The Dao/Way endures eternally, yet myriad beauties do not endure. Thus, it can observe all transformations. The sage knows that myriad beauties do not endure eternally because they embody the Dao/Way’s eternal constancy.

○ The Yellow River said: *Self* (自) means to follow (从). From ancient times to the present, the Dao/Way follows eternally.

○ Bi said: The utmost truth cannot be named. Without a name, that is its name. From ancient times to the present, all things arise from it, hence the saying: *from ancient times to the present, its name does not vanish* (自今及古，其名不去).

○ Pan said: The Dao/Way endures eternally, yet its manifestations change ceaselessly. It observes myriad beginnings.

Emperor Ming Huang said: *Observe* (阅) means to measure and discern. *Beginnings* (甫) means origin. This speaks of the utmost Dao/Way’s application—measuring and discerning the origins of myriad things, each fulfilling its own use of creation.

○ The Yellow River said: *Observe* (阅) means to receive. *Beginnings* (甫) means origin. This speaks of the Dao/Way bestowing and all things originating, receiving *qi* (气) from the Dao/Way.

○ Bi said: *Myriad beginnings* (众甫) are the origins of things. The Dao/Way is described as the origin of all things without a name.

○ Pan said: *Beginnings* (甫) means beauty. *Zhuangzi* says: *The divine and mysterious becomes foul and rotten, and the foul and rotten becomes divine and mysterious.* The myriad beauties of things shift and change without constancy, yet the Dao/Way endures eternally, hence its ability to observe all of them.

*Observe* (阅) is like *observing many people* (阅人多矣) in *Zhuangzi*.」

「How do I know that myriad beginnings are thus?
The Yellow River said: *How do I know?* It is because all things receive *qi* from the Dao/Way. *This* is the reason.

The Sage Emperor said: *This* is because today all things receive the Dao/Way, giving rise to wondrous transformations and creation, hence it is so.

○ The Yellow River said: *This* is *today*—because today all things obtain the refined *qi* of the Dao/Way and thus come to life, moving, acting, and dwelling. It is not that I know *how* the beginnings of all things arise from the formless; I simply *know* it.

○ Pan said: The Dao/Way endures eternally, yet myriad beauties are transient. Thus, it can observe all transformations. The Sage, therefore, knows that myriad beauties are transient because he embodies the Dao/Way’s eternal constancy.

*Qu then full, Chapter Twenty-Two*
*Qu then full*,

The Sage Emperor said: *Bend yourself to respond to duties*, then you are whole.

○ The Yellow River said: *Bend yourself to follow others*, do not assert your own views, then you are whole.

○ Bi said: *Do not reveal your own brilliance*, then you are whole.

○ [Another voice] said: The Perfect One is empty and void, his actions flow like water. He holds no intent toward things, yet follows their transformations. He does not contend with things—who could harm him? Thus, he remains ever whole.

The essence of this chapter aligns with *Zhuangzi’s* “Cultivating Life in the Way of Perfect Nourishment” (*Zhuangzi·Xiu Yangsheng Zhu*), *crookedness then straightness*.」

**Chapter Twenty-Two**
*Qu then full*,

The Sage Emperor said: *Bend yourself to fulfill others*, then you are upright.

○ The Yellow River said: *Bend and yield yourself* to fulfill others, and over time, you will naturally find uprightness.

○ Bi said: *Do not insist on your own correctness*, then your correctness will shine forth.

○ Pan said: *In form, you bend*; *in principle, you stand upright*. Those who cling to self will grasp their own uprightness when encountering things, yet fail to recognize the boundless transformations of things—*their uprightness becomes crooked*. Only by following the crookedness of things without holding to your own uprightness will *principle stand upright within you*.

One manuscript reads *直* (upright) as *正* (correct).

*Hollow then full*,
The Sage Emperor said: *Hold to humility and virtue*, then you will always be full.

○ The Yellow River said: The earth is hollow and low, so water flows to it. A person who is humble and low will have virtue bestowed upon them.

○ Bi said: *Do not self-praise*, then your achievements will naturally be recognized.

○ Pan said: By being humble and low like a marsh, all waters converge upon it. *Thus, it is ever full.*

*Worn then renewed*,
The Sage Emperor said: *Guard against defects and thinness*, then you will daily renew yourself.

○ The Yellow River said: *Receive defects and thinness upon yourself*, placing others before yourself—*the world will honor you*, and over time, you will naturally renew.

○ Bi said: *Do not boast of yourself*, then your virtue will endure.

○ Pan said: Without the withering of autumn and winter, there would be no splendor of spring and summer.

*Little then gain*,
The Sage Emperor said: *Hold to the One without separation*, then you will suffer no loss.

○ The Yellow River said: *Receive little upon yourself*, then you will gain much.

*The Dao/Way favors humility; the divine spirit entrusts itself to emptiness.*

○ Pan said: The Dao lies in subtlety; nature abides in simplicity. Those who attain it grasp its root, *thus they do not seek much*.

To embody the four matters above, only those who grasp the One can achieve it.

*Much then confusion*,
The Sage Emperor said: *If you have many actions*, then confusion and disorder arise.

○ The Yellow River said: Those with much wealth are confused by what they must guard; those with much learning are confused by what they must hear.

○ Bi said: The Way of nature is like a tree—*the more branches it turns out, the fewer its roots*. *The more it turns toward its roots*, the more it attains its essence.

*Much then distances from the true*, hence it is called *confusion*.
*Little then attains its essence*, hence it is called *gain*.

The Sage holds to the One as a model for all under heaven.

The Sage Emperor said: The Sage holds fast to the pure and undivided One, *thus he can serve as the law and model for all under heaven*.

○ The Yellow River said: He holds fast to the law and model.

The Sage knows all things by guarding the One, *thus he can serve as the law and model for all under heaven*.

○ Bi said: The One is the extreme of little. *Model* is akin to *standard*.

○ Xiu said: Those who hold to the One do not stray from its essence. *Only by holding to the One without division* can one embody the Dao and exhaust nature, achieving *mystical unity with all things*—*thus he can respond without end*.

This sentence follows the Dao’s principle from above: The Sage, by holding to the One, can perceive this principle, hence his actions align with what follows below.

*Do not reveal yourself, then your virtue is manifest*,
The Sage Emperor said: *If a person does not reveal his own virtue*, yet constantly bends himself to fulfill duties, then his virtue will be fully manifest.

○ The Yellow River said: The Sage does not claim to see beyond a thousand li, but instead uses the eyes of all under heaven to see—*thus he can manifest and reach far*.

○ Pan said: *If you reveal yourself*, then you have a self. Having a self, you will be worn down by it—*thus you cannot bend to respond to transformations*.

*Do not insist on your own correctness, then it will shine forth*,
The Sage Emperor said: *If a person does not insist on his own correctness*, yet bends himself to fulfill others, then his correctness will naturally shine forth.

○ The Yellow River said: The Sage does not insist on his own correctness to contradict others—*thus he can manifest and be displayed in the world*.

○ Pan said: Without insisting on your own correctness, you can bend to follow principle—*without seeking display, it will shine forth naturally*.

*Do not self-praise, then you have achievement*,
The Sage Emperor said: *If a person does not self-praise or take for himself*, then his achievements will naturally belong to him.

○ The Yellow River said: *Praise* is *taking*. The Sage’s virtue and transformation flow through all under heaven—*he does not take credit for his beauty*, thus he has achievement for all under heaven.

○ Pan said: *Praise* arises from arrogance and false pretension. Knowing that *hollowness is fullness*, how could there be the burden of arrogance and false pretension?

*Do not boast of yourself, then your virtue endures*,
The Sage Emperor said: *If a person can long guard against defects and thinness*, and not boast of himself, then others will esteem his enduring virtue.

○ The Yellow River said: *Boast* means *to magnify*. The Sage does not magnify himself—*thus he can endure without danger for long*.

○ Pan said: *Boasting* means *displaying his splendor*. Displaying splendor leads to weariness, *yet only by enduring weariness can one renew*.

*Only by not contending does one avoid contention under heaven.*

The Sage Emperor said: *If you do not contend with things*, who will contend with you?

○ The Yellow River said: This means that all under heaven—whether virtuous or unworthy—*cannot contend with those who do not contend*.

○ Pan said: *Only by being empty and void, not solid*, and having no intent toward things, will things desire to possess you yet fail—*how much more could they contend with you?*

The essence of this chapter lies in *forgetting the self*, hence it concludes with *not contending* and begins and ends with *qu then full*.

The ancients spoke of *qu then full*—was this not a true saying?

The Yellow River said: The ancients transmitted that *bending and following leads to wholeness*—*this is not false or baseless*.

*If truly whole, return to it.*

The Sage Emperor said: The ancients spoke of *qu then full*—was this not a true saying? *If one truly bends and follows*, he will grasp the principle and return to it.

○ The Yellow River said: *Sincerity* is *reality*. Those who can practice bending and following are *real in their body and substance*—*they return to their parents*, suffering no harm.

○ Pan said: *Bending* means *emptying oneself to follow principle*, letting things transform while not contending with them. All the sayings above converge on this: *If truly whole, return to it*—*this is the meaning of the butcher Ding’s skill with the knife yet hiding it*. I dare say this chapter’s essence lies in *nourishing life*.

The Sage’s approach to life does not rely on self-nourishment, *yet none nourish life better than he*.
The sayings *do not reveal yourself, do not insist on your own correctness, do not self-praise, do not boast*—*are not about suppressing the self to achieve wholeness*, but rather *an innate, effortless understanding*.

The **Daoist Classic of the Mysterious Pivot** (with collected annotations, Volume 3)
#1 Greed: [Original: "贫" (*pín*, "poverty"), amended from the Daoist Canon’s Tang Xuānzōng’s imperial annotation.]

**Volume 4** – *Annotations by Emperor Mínghuáng, Hé Shànggōng, Wáng Bì, and Wáng Piān*
**Chapter 23: The Dao of Effortless Speech** (*Xīyán zìrán*)

*"Effortless speech."* Emperor Mínghuáng said: *"Effortless"* means *"to transcend speech."* Yet it does not say *"forget speech"* but *"effortless"*—for the Dao is elucidated through speech, and speech cannot be entirely forgotten. When one awakens to the Dao, speech is forgotten, hence *"effortless."*

If one can grasp the Dao through speech without being bound by it, then one attains the natural.

○ Hé Shànggōng said: *"Effortless speech"* means *"to cherish speech."* Cherishing speech is the Dao of the natural.

○ Wáng Bì said: *"Speech that is heard yet not named"* is called *effortless*—the next chapter speaks of the Dao’s utterance: *"dim and flavorless"* (*dàn xī qí wú wèi*), *"seen yet indistinct"* (*shì zhī bù zú jiàn*), *"heard yet not fully audible"* (*tīng zhī bù zú wén*). Thus, speech that is *"dim and flavorless"* yet still heard is the *ultimate effortless speech* of the natural.

○ Wáng Piān said: *"Effortless"* shares the same meaning as *"heard yet not named"* in the previous chapter—*the natural* does not arise from things yet is not bound by them. *Effortless* does not align with things yet remains unaffected by them; it stands alone above all phenomena, hence it is natural.

Thus, gusting winds do not last a morning,
sudden rains do not last a day.

Emperor Mínghuáng said: *"Gusting winds and sudden rains"* bring ruin to the harvests and harm to things; swift speech and stubborn adherence bring loss of the Dao and delusion.

○ Hé Shànggōng said: *"Gusting winds"* are swift winds, *"sudden rains"* are torrential rains. Swift winds cannot endure, torrential rains cannot last.

○ Wáng Piān said: *"Gusting winds and sudden rains"* are the work of *yin-yang interaction*. Their swiftness and violence are the excess of interaction, hence they cannot endure. Who does this? *The heavens and the earth.*

「Hé said: *Existence* (执) is a matter of *who*—who causes the gusting winds and torrential rains? It is the heavens and the earth.
The heavens and the earth, even in their vastness, when they act violently and abruptly, harm things and cannot endure.
Hé said: They do not last until morning or evening. How much less can mortals endure?

Emperor Mínghuáng said: The heavens and the earth are boundless in their *virtue/power* (神), yet when they act violently and abruptly, they cannot last until morning or evening. How much more so for mortals who seek to do so?

*Stubborn adherence* (执) to words and *rigid fixation* on teachings lead to harm in the Dao.
Those who eagerly seek sudden enlightenment, can they truly attain it?

Hé said: When mortals act violently and abruptly, their deeds rise swiftly yet cannot endure.
Thus, those who engage in the Dao should not stubbornly adhere to words or rigidly fixate on teachings.

Emperor Mínghuáng said: Those who embody the Dao forget words, and thus align with the Dao.

Hé said: *Dao-practitioners* (道者) are those who love the Dao. To align with the Dao means their actions harmonize with it.

Bì said: *Engaging in the Dao* (从事) refers to movements and actions undertaken in the Dao.
The Dao accomplishes all things through *effortless non-action* (无形无为), so those who engage in the Dao should take *non-action* (无为) as their sovereign.
They should not speak as if teaching—if they do so even faintly, things will attain their true nature.
Thus, they align with the Dao in essence, and it is said: *to align with the Dao* (同於道).

Hóng said: The original text had no mention of *Dao-practitioners* (道者). *Virtue-practitioners* (德者) align with *virtue/power* (德).

Emperor Mínghuáng said: *Virtue/power* (德) is the name for the Dao’s manifestation. If mortals embody the Dao’s intent and exert their efforts, then their deeds align with the Dao’s manifestation.

Hé said: *Virtue-practitioners* (德者) are those who love *virtue/power* (德). To align with *virtue/power* (德) means their actions harmonize with it.

Bì said: *Attainment* (得) means *sparse/little* (少). Sparse is *virtue/power* (德), hence it is called *attainment* (得). To act in *attainment* (得) is to align with *sparse/little* (少), hence it is said: *to align with attainment* (同於得).

*Loss* (失) aligns with *loss* (失).

Emperor Mínghuáng said: Stubborn adherence to words and rigid fixation on teachings leave no path to enlightenment. Without enlightenment, one falls into delusion of the Dao, thus aligning with *loss* (失).

Hé said: *Loss* (失) means to indulge oneself while neglecting others. To align with *loss* (失) is to align with what is called *loss* (失).

Bì said: *Accumulation* (累) means *many*. Many accumulations lead to *loss* (失), hence it is called *loss* (失). To act in *loss* (失) is to align with *many/accumulation* (累), hence it is said: *to align with loss* (同於失).

Xiù said: In the original text, *virtue/power* (德) was written as *attainment* (得). To align with the Dao is for the Dao to also *attain* (得) it. Hé said: Those who align with the Dao also rejoice in its *attainment* (得). To align with *virtue/power* (德) is for *virtue/power* (德) to also *attain* (得) it. Hé said: Those who align with *virtue/power* (德) also rejoice in its *attainment* (得). To align with *loss* (失) is for *loss* (失) to also *attain* (得) it. Emperor Mínghuáng said: Like holding water to distinguish its kind, or using a concave mirror to attract fire—these are ways to classify things, and the outcome can be known.

Hé said: Those who align with *loss* (失) also rejoice in their *loss* (失).

Bì said: It means to follow one’s actions accordingly, hence aligning and responding.

Hóng said: All mortals are born without needing things to exist—this is called *spontaneous transformation* (独化).
Without needing things to exist, they inherently align with *sparse/little* (希) and are natural.
Yet those who lose their nature fabricate a false self, and in engaging with the Dao, they bend themselves to conform with it.
Thus, the Dao becomes their master, and what I call their sovereign is actually submitting themselves to the Dao.
Therefore, those who engage in the Dao have these three categories—*Dao* (道), *virtue/power* (德), *loss* (失)—yet all converge in *loss* (失).
This arises from not penetrating *sparse/little* (希), establishing oneself while awaiting things, and separating unity into duality, giving rise to *yin-yang interaction* (交感) and the generation of life and death.

*Faith* (信) is insufficient.
Hé said: If the sovereign’s faith is insufficient toward the people, the people will respond with their own insufficiency toward the sovereign.
There is *unfaithfulness* (不信).

Emperor Mínghuáng said: Stubborn adherence to words and rigid fixation on teachings leave no path to enlightenment—this is insufficient faith, aligning with *loss* (失). *Loss* (失) rejoices in *loss* (失), this is *unfaithfulness* (不信).

Hé said: This speaks of things of the same kind converging, and voices of the same tone resonating—clouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger, water flows to the moist, fire seeks the dry. These are natural correspondences.

Bì said: If loyalty and faith are insufficient toward the people, how can there be *unfaithfulness* (不信)?

Hóng said: Descending to *sparse/little* (希) means losing the Dao’s natural order, and in faith, it is insufficient.
If the sovereign’s faith is insufficient, the people will inevitably respond with *unfaithfulness* (不信). This further clarifies that refining oneself and governing others must all experience *sparse/little* (希).

*Those who advance do not stand firm* (跂者不立), Chapter Twenty-Four.
*Those who advance* (跂者) do not stand firm.
Hé said: *Advance* (跂) means *progress* (进). If one covets authority and craves fame, seeking功 and honor, one cannot long endure in the Dao.

Bì said: Things still progress and lose stability, hence it is said: *those who advance do not stand firm* (企者不立).

*Those who straddle do not walk* (跨者不行).
Emperor Mínghuáng said: *Advance* (跂) is to lift one’s heel and gaze ahead. *Straddle* (跨) is to grasp things with one’s stride. This likens seeking clarity in oneself—yet clarity is never truly obtained. How different is it from *advancing* (跂) to seek enduring stability or *straddling* (跨) to seek movement?

Hé said: If one assumes superiority and straddles others, the multitude will obstruct them, preventing them from walking.

Hóng said: Not conforming to one’s natural form means losing the nature’s function. *Self-illumination* (自见) is not true clarity.

Emperor Mínghuáng said: *Illustrious talent* (灵才) flaunts itself, and in action, it invites blame, hence it is not true clarity.

Hé said: If one admires their own appearance and actions, believing them to be good and fitting with the Dao, they do not truly know their own ugliness and the vulgarity of their conduct. *Self-affirmation* (自是) does not shine brightly.

Emperor Mínghuáng said: *Affirming oneself while denying others* (是己非人) is simply a source of resentment, hence it does not shine brightly.

Hé said: If one affirms themselves while denying others, the multitude will obstruct them, preventing them from shining brightly.

*Self-praise* (自伐) yields no merit.
Emperor Mínghuáng said: *Exclusive rigidity* (专固) and *self-praise* (伐取) are what things do not accord with, hence no merit is achieved.

Hé said: If one praises their own deeds and claims their merits as good, they immediately lose the merit of having truly benefited others.»

「Self-conceit does not endure.
Emperor Mínghuáng said: *Self-conceit* in one’s skills and abilities is despised by people, hence it does not endure. ○ Hé said: Those who delight in their own self-conceit cannot last long. In terms of the Dao, it is called *excessive accumulation* (余食) and *superfluous conduct* (赘行).
Hé said: *Superfluous* (赘) means *greed* (贪). If such self-conceited and boastful individuals were to govern a state, their *excessive taxation and plunder* (赋敛余禄) would be a greedy deed.

○ Bì said: If we speak solely of the Dao, it is like the *abundance of a neighbor’s harvest* (邻至之行) or the *surplus of their labor* (盛撰之余). Though the foundation may be virtuous, it can become even more corrupt. Though the foundation may have merit, if one boasts of it themselves, it becomes a *blemish or superfluous burden*—thus, it is no longer meritorious.

○ Pán said: All these things are *extraneous* (分外). People may detest them.
Hé said: This person in office, every action they take seeks to harm. Hence, there is nothing that does not fear and hate them. Therefore, those who follow the Dao do not engage with such matters.

Emperor Mínghuáng said: *Self-conceit* in one’s conduct, when discussed in terms of the Dao, is called *the food of the残余* (残余之食) and *superfluous deeds* (疣赘之行). Even ordinary things may hate them, so those who follow the Dao do not involve themselves in such affairs.

○ Hé said: It means that those who follow the Dao do not reside in such a state.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Formless Essence (有物混成)**

There is a formless essence that arises before Heaven and Earth.
Emperor Mínghuáng said: To clarify the origin of the Dao and its naming, it is said that there is a formless essence. This essence contains all things, and when tracing its transformation, it is seen to precede Heaven and Earth.

○ Hé said: It refers to the Dao being shapeless yet forming all things. Thus, all things exist before Heaven and Earth.
○ Bì said: Though the essence is formless and cannot be grasped, all things arise from it. Hence, it is called *formless essence* (混成).

We do not know whose offspring it is, so it is said to arise before Heaven and Earth.
○ Pán said: The essence within the Dao is formless yet complete. In its view of Heaven and Earth, it is but one thing. Laozi sought to gather the scattered, chaotic, and confused world and restore it to its original nature, hence he merely raises the formless essence. Indeed, from the perspective of myriad distinctions, this is the Dao’s entirety. Yet from the Dao’s original essence, even the formless is but a scattering of distinctions. When seen as a thing, the Dao’s essence reveals its own profound mysteries.

Silent and boundless,
○ Pán said: The formless essence has no manifestation.
Standing alone yet unchanging,
Hé said: *Silent* (寂) means without sound or voice; *boundless* (寥) means empty and shapeless. *Standing alone* (独立) implies no equal or pair. *Unchanging* (不改) refers to the constant nature of the virtuous.

○ Bì said: *Silent and boundless* (寂寥) means without form or substance. It has no equal in things, hence it is called *standing alone* (独立). It returns to transformation without end, never losing its constancy, hence it is called *unchanging* (不改).

○ Pán said: The essence of the formless is constant and unchanging.
Its circulation is endless and without peril,
Hé said: The Dao flows through the earth, entering everywhere without obstruction. In the yang, it does not linger; in the yin, it does not steal. It penetrates all things, never in danger or peril.

○ Pán said: This is the Dao’s function. All things arise from it in life and death; it eternally governs their fate. Who could threaten it? It can be the *mother of all under Heaven*.

Emperor Mínghuáng said: The essence of the Dao is silent, boundless, and empty—its profound origin is constantly serene and silent. It applies universally to all things, hence its circulation is endless and without peril. All things draw life from it and receive its nurturing virtue, so it can be called the *mother of all under Heaven*.

○ Hé said: The Dao nourishes all things like a mother nurtures her child.
○ Bì said: Though it circulates everywhere without omission, it remains free from peril, and it can generate the complete and vast form. Hence, it can be called the *mother of Heaven and Earth*.

I do not know its name,
Bì said: Names are used to define forms, but the formless essence cannot be defined. Hence, it is said that I do not know its name.

So I call it *Dao*,
Hé said: I do not see the Dao’s form, nor do I know how to name it. Yet I see all things arise from the Dao, so I call it *Dao*.

○ Bì said: Names are used to define forms, and words are used to express what is praiseworthy. The Dao takes shape from nothingness, and its greatest praiseworthy name is *Dao*. If forced to name it, I would say *Great* (大).

Emperor Mínghuáng said: I see this formless essence giving rise to all things, hidden without a name. Thus, I use *Dao* to manifest its virtue, calling it *Dao* to encompass its scope. Yet its name is simply *Great* (大).

○ Hé said: Though I do not know its name, I call it *Great* (大) because it is vast yet without limit, encompassing all without exclusion.
○ Bì said: I call it *Dao* because it is the greatest name that can be spoken of. When accounting for the origin of its name, it is rooted in *Great* (大). *Great* implies connection, and connection must entail distinctions. With distinctions, its ultimate essence is lost, hence it is said that if forced to name it, I would call it *Great*.

○ Xiù said: The Dao, when compared to all things, is without boundaries—thus it can be called *Great*. However, once the name *Great* is established, its full essence is diminished.

*Great* means *transient*,
Hé said: Its greatness is not like Heaven’s constant presence above or Earth’s constant presence below. Rather, it is transient, without a fixed abode.

○ Bì said: *Transient* (逝) means *circulation*. It does not cling to one thing; it is merely the great essence. Its circulation is boundless, hence it is called *transient*.

○ Pán said: Greatness implies function. *Transient* means it circulates through all things, and its function is manifest.

*Transient* means *distant*,
Hé said: *Distant* (远) means it extends to the limitless, spreading *qi* throughout Heaven and Earth without obstruction.

○ Pán said: The Dao’s function reaches all extremes—thus it is distant. Yet in its distance from the origin, it is also the formless essence. When the Dao is at its utmost, it is neither distant nor near.»

「*Distant* means *return*.

○ **Mínghuáng** said: Its wondrous function is boundless. If one forcibly names it, one cannot grasp it. Hence, when one seeks greatness, it *circulates and departs*; when one seeks it from its departure, one cannot reach it. If one can truly comprehend, then *return* is found within one’s own **body-mind** (*shēnxīn*) and realized.

○ **Hé** said: Though it is distant, it does not exceed the absolute—yet it is also present within the human form.

○ **Bì** said: *Distant* means *extreme*. It exhausts all limits without favoring any single place, hence it is called *distant*. It does not conform to any particular path; its intent stands alone, hence it is called *return*.

○ **Xiù** said: What is formed and named again returns to the formless and nameless, endlessly circulating, returning to its beginning. Hence, the **Dao/Way** is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the **Sovereign** (*wáng*) is also great.

○ **Mínghuáng** said: Following what makes each great, one attains unity—Heaven, Earth, and the Sovereign. Heaven’s greatness lies in its ability to cover all; Earth’s greatness lies in its ability to bear all; the Sovereign’s greatness lies in following Earth while embodying Heaven and the **Dao/Way**, hence it is also called great.

○ **Hé** said: The greatness of the **Dao/Way** encompasses all **Heavens and Earths** (*zhūtian dì*), containing nothing it does not embrace. Heaven’s greatness covers all without exception. Earth’s greatness bears all without exclusion. The Sovereign’s greatness governs all without restraint.

○ **Bì** said: Though Heaven and Earth possess the nature of greatness, humanity is most noble, and the Sovereign is the master of humanity. Though not inherently great, the Sovereign nonetheless is great—equal to the three (*sān* [Heaven, Earth, and the Dao])—hence it is said the Sovereign is also great.

○ **Pán** said: Heaven and Earth can embody the **Dao/Way**, hence they are great. The Sovereign, though subordinate to the **Emperor** (*dìhuáng*) and the **Dao/Way**, is the culmination of human conduct. Even if the teachings of **Lǎozi** (*Old Master Lao*) do not exhaust the ultimate boundaries of the **Dao/Way**, they merely emphasize its inherent nature. The Sovereign, by naming *return and departure*, can exhaust the nature of humanity—then humanity will submit to it, just as all grains converge upon the rivers and seas. Exhausting nature means embodying the **Dao/Way**, hence it is shown as great.

Within the **Four Great** (*sìdà*), **Bì** said: The **Four Great** are the **Dao/Way**, Heaven, Earth, and the Sovereign. All things have names and designations, yet these are not their ultimate extremes. When one speaks of the **Dao/Way**, it implies a source and origin—only then is it called the **Dao/Way**. Thus, this is the greatness within names, not the greatness of the nameless. The nameless cannot be designated, hence it is called the **domain** (*yù*) of the **Four Great**. The **Dao/Way**, Heaven, Earth, and the Sovereign all exist within the nameless, hence it is said the **Four Great** are within the domain.

○ **Pán** said: The **Dao/Way**’s central embodiment relies upon things to be named, hence it does not depart from the domain of the **Four Great**. Yet the Sovereign occupies one position.

○ **Mínghuáng** said: The Sovereign is the guiding spirit of humanity; all things depend upon his rise and fall. To warn the Sovereign and establish his governance, it is said that the Sovereign occupies one position—this is to caution him to have laws, referring to the following text.

○ **Hé** said: Within the **Eight Extremes** (*bājí*), there are the **Four Great**, and the Sovereign occupies one.

○ **Bì** said: He occupies the greatness of the human master.

○ **Pán** said: Originally, it was said the Sovereign occupies one position. Humanity should follow Earth’s stillness and yielding softness. When planting, one reaps the **Five Grains** (*wǔgǔ*); when digging, one finds sweet springs—laboring without complaint, achieving merit without claiming it.

○ **Pán** said: It speaks of the Sovereign selecting those who exhaust humanity’s nature—now it speaks of humanity. The Sovereign’s **virtue/power** (*dé*) is confined to human affairs, yet humanity’s nature inherently possesses the Sovereign’s **virtue/power**. Earth follows Heaven. **Hé** said: Heaven is serene and unchanging, giving without demanding return, nurturing all things without taking anything. Heaven follows the **Dao/Way**. **Hé** said: The **Dao/Way** is pure and still, acting silently through refined **qi**, allowing all things to form naturally. The **Dao/Way** follows **Nature** (*zìrán*).

○ **Mínghuáng** said: When speaking of the Sovereign, one should first follow Earth’s stillness. Then, one should follow Heaven’s nurturing and generative function. Having achieved generativity, one should follow the **Dao/Way**’s purity and non-action, allowing things to transform themselves. If a ruler can do this, he embodies the **Dao/Way**’s natural, self-soothing essence.

○ **Hé** said: The **Dao/Way** endures and grows naturally, without need of governance.

○ **Bì** said: *Governance* (*fǎ*) refers to principles and laws. If humanity does not defy Earth, it attains full stillness—this is following Earth. If Earth does not defy Heaven, it attains full capacity to bear—this is following Heaven. If Heaven does not defy the **Dao/Way**, it can fully cover all—this is following the **Dao/Way**. If the **Dao/Way** does not defy **Nature**, then it attains its true essence—this is following **Nature**. In the square, one follows the square; in the round, one follows the round. In **Nature**, there is no defiance. **Nature** is the speech of the nameless and the words of the limitless. Using wisdom cannot reach the state of no-knowing, yet the **form and vitality** (*xíngpò*) cannot match the **refined essence and subtle appearance** (*jīngxiàng*), nor can the **refined essence and subtle appearance** match the formless. Having ritual propriety is not as good as having none—hence the **Dao/Way**’s relative governance.

The **Dao/Way** follows **Nature**, Heaven thus relies upon it. Heaven follows the **Dao/Way**, Earth thus conforms to it. Earth follows Heaven, humanity thus mirrors it. This is why it is said the Sovereign occupies one position as the master of the one.

○ **Pán** said: Though **Nature** precedes the **Dao/Way**, it is still not the ultimate of the **Dao/Way**. When relying on things to speak, these four—**Dao/Way**, Heaven, Earth, and the Sovereign—are like successive governance leading to discussion, yet each remains unaware of its origin, with no precedence. **Zhuāngzi** said: *The non-doing of Ji Zhen* (*jìzhēn zhī mòwéi*) meets *the doing of Zi You* (*zǐyǒu zhī huò*), yet both are within the realm of things, each bending in its own way. The **Buddhist School** (*fóshì*) says: It is neither caused nor spontaneous, nor is it **Nature**. **Nature** exists above all things yet emerges beyond the realm of things. This explanation lies beneath **Zhuāngzi** and the **Buddha**, yet **Lǎozi**’s non-doing is not the teaching of the **Unparalleled Sage** (*bùshèng shèng*). It is merely fitting for its time, not contradicting principle—thus scholars should not stop at **Nature** as a fixed conclusion, for this would lose the true meaning and be far from the truth. It must be carefully examined.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: "Heavy as the Root of Light"**
*Heavy as the root of light*,

○ **Mínghuáng** said: The heavy governs the light, hence the heavy is the root.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: "Heavy as the Root of Light"**
*Heavy as the root of light,*
**Mínghuáng** said: The heavy governs the light, hence the heavy is the root.
**Hé** said: A ruler who is not heavy will not be revered; cultivating the body without gravity will lose its essence. Flowers of grasses and trees are light, so they wither and fall, but roots are heavy, so they endure.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: "Stillness as Sovereign of Turbulence"**
*Stillness as sovereign of turbulence,*
**Mínghuáng** said: Stillness governs movement, hence stillness is sovereign.
**Hé** said: A ruler who is not still will lose his essence; cultivating the body without stillness invites peril. The dragon remains still and thus transforms; the tiger is turbulent and thus meets early ruin.

**Bì** said: All things—light cannot bear what is heavy, small cannot govern what is great. What does not move makes movement possible, what does not stir controls turbulence. Thus, the heavy must be the root of the light, and stillness must be sovereign over turbulence.

Therefore, the virtuous person walks all day without abandoning his **zīzhòng** (supply wagons).
**Mínghuáng** said: *Zī* means "car." *Zhòng* refers to the carried goods.
The light and turbulent revere the heavy and still, for those who walk abandon their supply wagons and suffer cold and hunger, while those who love the light and turbulent invite disaster.

**Hé** said: *Zī* also means "stillness."
The Sage walks the Dao all day without departing from his stillness and his heaviness.

**Bì** said: Take heaviness as foundation and never depart from it.

**Páng** said: Movement relies on lightness for speed, yet must depend on supply wagons for sustenance. If one strays far from them, one will inevitably falter along the way.

Though there are palaces of splendor,
Though there are resorts of ease,
**Mínghuáng** said: A ruler must guard his heaviness and stillness, so even amid palaces of splendor, he must dwell in ease and detachment, unconcerned with superficial displays.

**Hé** said: *Hóngguān* refers to palaces and gates. *Yànchǔ* is where the consorts reside. *Chāorán* means to withdraw and not dwell there.

**Bì** said: This is because one does not fixate on them.

**Páng** said: Though palaces of splendor lie before him, he must first secure his place of ease to ensure his safety—this clarifies the meaning of turbulence and stillness.

How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
**Hé** said: *Rúhé* is an exclamation of lament for the times. *Wànshèng zhǔ* refers to the king.

lighten himself against the world?
**Mínghuáng** said: *Rúhé* is an exclamatory sigh. The world is the seat of great treasure. It speaks of how a ruler might abandon his body to desire, lightly squandering himself and losing his throne.

**Hé** said: The king is most exalted—how can he act with lightness and turbulence? This laments the king’s extravagance and licentiousness.

**Xiù** said: The ruler takes the world as his root; he cannot treat his body lightly. If he does, he will lose his ministers.

**Hé** said: If the king indulges in lightness and turbulence, he will lose his ministers. If he is turbulent in self-cultivation, he will lose his essence.

**Bì** said: Lightness is not true heaviness; losing one’s foundation is to lose oneself. Losing one’s "sovereign" refers to losing one’s throne.

**Páng** said: *Chén* (ministers) is also *běn* (root).

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: "The Chapter of Virtuous Conduct"**

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: "The Chapter of Virtuous Conduct"**

**Virtuous Conduct has no fixed path,**
*Mínghuáng* said: Among all teachings, if one loses the true nature, conduct becomes formless—thus it is called *Virtuous Conduct*. When thus, the heart merges with the Dao, leaving no trace to follow.

○ *Hé* said: The practitioner of Virtuous Conduct seeks it within oneself—never descending the hall, never stepping beyond the door—thus leaving no tracks.

○ *Bì* said: Following nature spontaneously, neither contriving nor initiating, things arrive naturally without leaving traces.

○ *Páng* said: Embracing the spirit, one moves boundlessly without edge. Moreover, the Sage acts only when necessary, ensuring no traces remain in the world, lest the people abandon his virtue. This is what *Zhuangzi* calls "moving without leaving a trace."

**Virtuous Speech has no flaw or blame,**
*Mínghuáng* said: Mastering the teachings, one does not cling rigidly; abandoning images, one seeks intent. Logic confirms speech, yet speech is forgotten—thus, within teachings, there are no flaws or errors.

○ *Hé* said: Virtuous speech is choosing words carefully, so no flaw exists, nor does it err against the world.

○ *Bì* said: Following things’ nature without division or coercion, there is no need for selection—one may enter its gate.

○ *Páng* said: Words emerge like the sun’s daily rise, yet they do not originate from the heart. Though they fill the world, truly they have never spoken—how then could there be flaws or blame?

**Virtuous Planning requires no calculations,**
*Mínghuáng* said: Realizing all teachings stem from the single gate of non-duality, unified in one thread, no other perceptions arise—thus no need for artificial schemes. If not beyond all calculations, what could be more virtuous?

○ *Hé* said: The virtuous planner, devoted to the Dao, adheres to unity without deviation. Few calculations are needed, so no clever strategies are required.

○ *Bì* said: Following natural numbers without artificial means.

○ *Páng* said: One generates two, two generates three—thus onward, no clever reckoning can measure. Only merging with the singular aspect, avoiding all numbers, does one find nothing external. When things arise, they are understood—what need for calculations?

*(Alternative text: Virtuous Planning has no reckoning rods.)*

**Virtuous Closure has no door or bolt yet cannot be opened,**
*Mínghuáng* said: Forgetting speech and conduct, not entering other gates, the heart does not chase phenomena, bearing no burden of intention—though no doors or bolts exist, how could it be opened?

○ *Páng* said: Concealed in what cannot be pursued, closed by what has no outside, the closure admits nothing—who could open it? This resembles the *Yijing*’s "retreat and hide in secrecy."

Thus, even the spirit cannot spy its traces—how much less could one enter its gate?

**Virtuous Binding has no cords or knots yet cannot be undone,**
*Mínghuáng* said: Realizing true nature, one relies on emptiness and forgetting. If emptiness and forgetting are achieved, the heart unites with the Dao—though no cords or bindings exist, how could it be loosened or scattered?

○ *Hé* said: The virtuous one who binds matters through the Dao can bind the heart—nothing like cords can undo it.

○ *Bì* said: Following things’ nature without contrivance or application, no need for locks, cords, or bindings arises—thus it cannot be opened or undone.

These five virtues all speak of non-contrivance, non-application, following things’ nature without shaping them artificially.

○ *Páng* said: The Sage binds the world’s trust with personal integrity—who could undo it?

Thus, the Sage constantly rescues people.
○ *Hé* said: The Sage teaches loyalty and filiality to rescue people’s lives and nature. Hence, no one is abandoned.
○ *Hé* said: The noble and lowly each find their place.

○ *Bì* said: The Sage does not establish artificial names to govern things, nor does he contrive advancement or reject the unworthy. He aids all things’ natural unfolding without initiating—thus, no one is abandoned. If virtue is not exalted, the people do not compete; if rare goods are not prized, the people do not steal; if desires are unseen, the people’s hearts remain undisturbed. Constantly keeping the people’s hearts free of desire and confusion, no one’s nature is abandoned.

Constantly rescuing things,
○ *Hé* said: The Sage teaches the people to follow the four seasons, rescuing all things from harm. Thus, nothing is abandoned.
*Mínghuáng* said: Therefore, the Sage constantly uses these five virtues to teach, so none are

○ *Hé* said: When people act virtuously, the Sage takes them as teachers for others.

○ *Bì* said: By elevating the virtuous as teachers for the unvirtuous, they are called teachers.

The unvirtuous are the virtuous’ means of use.
*Mínghuáng* said: *Teacher* is *law/pattern*. *Means of use* is *to take*.
The virtuous may be emulated as a law, the unvirtuous taken to serve.

○ *Hé* said: *Means of use* is *to employ*.
Though people act unvirtuously, the Sage still instructs them toward virtue, that they may be employed.

○ *Bì* said: *Means of use* is *to take*.
The virtuous harmonize the unvirtuous with virtue, discard the unvirtuous with virtue—thus, the unvirtuous are what the virtuous take.

○ *Máng* said: Only when there are unvirtuous does the virtuous’ salvific function manifest—thus, *means of use*.

Not esteeming the teacher,
○ *Hé* said: It is because there is no reliance upon it.

Not cherishing the means of use,
*Mínghuáng* said: This passage holds deep meaning—teaching the simultaneous forgetting. If one retains the teacher and means of use, it is not yet the ultimate.
Now, the reason the Sage esteems the teacher is to preserve the *learning aspect*, but once the *learning aspect* is emptied, there is nothing to esteem. The reason one cherishes the means of use is to preserve the *teaching aspect*, yet in forgetting teaching, one does not cherish the means of use. Esteem and cherishing both forgotten, the Dao transforms of itself.

○ *Hé* said: There is none to employ.

○ *Máng* said: The Sage shares in the people’s joys and calamities, thus he firmly establishes the names of teacher and means of use, assuming the guise of salvific virtue. Yet when pushed to its limit, the Dao unifies as one—who then is teacher or means of use? Thus, it is not merely that I do not cherish the means of use, but I can also make the world forget me.
Thus, one arrives at making the world abandon the self—also through the five virtues alone.
Even the wise are deeply deluded,

「Hé said: Though one may deem oneself wise, yet this person is deeply deluded. ○ Bì said: Though there be wisdom, if one relies solely upon it and does not conform to the Dao through things, it must be lost—thus it is said, "Even the wise are deeply deluded." ○ Máng said: The wise possess knowledge, and with knowledge one can perceive the principles of things. Yet they fail to grasp the subtlety of the formless, thus when the Dao reaches such profundity, the wise are deeply deluded. This is called the *essential subtlety*.

○ Emperor Minghuáng said: When both teacher and means of use are forgotten, this is called *mysterious virtue*. The common multitude does not awaken to this, assuming it to be profound delusion—thus the Sage declares: Though knowing, the common multitude deems it profound delusion; yet when viewed through the Dao, this is called *essential subtlety*. ○ Hé said: To comprehend this meaning is to know the *Dao of subtle essentials*.

**Chapter XXVIII: Knowing the Masculine**

Knowing the masculine, guarding the feminine,
○ Máng said: The masculine is active, the feminine is passive; when passive, one does not stray from the True. Yet mere passivity is not the fullness of the Dao—thus the Perfect One regards the feminine as constant, yet always knows the masculine.

To become the valley of the world.
○ Hé said: The masculine symbolizes nobility, the feminine symbolizes humility; though one may know one’s own nobility and splendor, one must still guard it with humility, abandoning the masculine’s forcefulness and embracing the feminine’s gentleness—thus the world will turn to them, like water flowing into deep valleys.

○ Xiāo said: Valleys receive and accommodate all things, flowing and passing through them. By guarding the feminine, one can receive all dharmas with emptiness and tranquility, yet not be obstructed by things—thus it is said, "To become the valley of the world," this is the one who fully realizes their nature.

To become the valley of the world, constant virtue does not depart.
○ Hé said: If one can be humble to the world, like a deep valley, then virtue remains constant and does not depart from oneself.

○ Máng said: Constant virtue is fixed and does not shift—this is the Dao within oneself. "Does not depart" means unity within one’s nature, without externalization.

Returning to the state of infancy.
○ Emperor Minghuáng said: The masculine is loyal to the use of strength—thus knowing the masculine, one must guard the feminine. By humbling one’s virtue and accommodating things, one becomes the world’s valley; thus constant virtue abides, containing the Dao in harmony, returning to the conduct of infancy.

○ Hé said: One must return to the mind of infancy, devoid of knowledge yet complete.

○ Bì said: The masculine belongs to the realm of the prior, the feminine to the realm of the latter.

Knowing what is the world’s beginning, one must be its end.
Thus the Sage ends himself, yet himself is the beginning.

Valleys do not seek things, yet things return to them.
Infants do not employ wisdom, yet they embody natural intelligence.

○ Máng said: The infant contains harmony and guards unity—desires do not arise, the nature’s original truth is whole yet undivided, the utmost depth of virtue, thus returning to the beginning. If one attains this, they may be called *Great*.

Mencius said: The Great Person does not lose their childlike heart.

Knowing the bright, guarding the dark,
○ Máng said: The dark is the color of the Northern Pole—passivity cannot fully describe it. The Sage establishes all dharmas; without guarding the dark, there is no foundation for their true nature. This is verified by the emergence of spring and summer from the profound winter.

To become the model of the world.
○ Hé said: The bright symbolizes clarity, the dark symbolizes silence; though one may know their own brightness and clarity, one must still guard it with silence, like darkness where nothing is seen—thus one can become the world’s model, and virtue remains constant.

○ Bì said: *Shì* means the standard by which one models themselves.

To become the model of the world.
○ Máng said: The Perfect One takes the Sage as the world’s model—this is because the Sage embodies the central truth.

Constant virtue is not forceful,
○ Hé said: If one can become the world’s model, virtue remains constant within them and does not deviate toward forcefulness.

○ Bì said: *Wǔ* means deviation.

○ Máng said: In matters of great scope, if one doubts the use of forcefulness yet responds appropriately to things, like the natural cycles of cold and heat in Heaven, without the heart accumulating resentment, then one does not deviate toward forcefulness.

Returning to the boundless.
○ Emperor Minghuáng said: Though virtue may be noble and bright, one must always guard it with darkness and humility—when one responds to things without deviation, constant virtue is boundless, thus returning to the boundless.

*Wǔ* means deviation.
○ Hé said: When virtue does not deviate toward forcefulness, one attains longevity and eternal life, returning to the boundless.

○ Bì said: It cannot be exhausted.

○ Máng said: To transform and harmonize greatly is called *Sage*—harmonization is daily yet boundless, thus the boundless is the Sage’s essence.

From the essence, actions arise; returning to one’s origin.

Knowing the flourishing, guarding the abased,
○ Máng said: When the Sage reaches this stage, they equal all phenomena, yet have not returned to their origin. The utmost of virtue, not yet fulfilling the purpose of embodying the spirit, is like this. The ancient Daoists wore tattered garments and coarse robes, dwelling in filth and lowliness, teaching in obscurity—this is in accord with this principle.

To become the valley of the world.
○ Hé said: *Flourishing* symbolizes nobility and splendor, *abased* symbolizes filth and lowliness; though one may possess nobility and splendor, one must guard it with filth and lowliness—thus the world will turn to them, like water flowing into deep valleys.

○ Máng said: Valleys are both empty and full, yet can respond to all things—thus they mirror the spirit. The spirit is complete and boundless, without external limits; though it exists, one cannot grasp it, and though it acts, it is inexhaustible—this is guarding the abased with precision.

Precision thus can embody the spirit, only through precision can one enter the spirit.

To become the valley of the world, constant virtue is then sufficient.
○ Hé said: *Sufficient* means to stop or cease.

If one can become the world’s valley, virtue will then abide within them.

○ Máng said: Lowering the spirit by one degree, it becomes insufficient within one’s nature—thus when the Dao reaches the stage of embodying the spirit, it is the true fulfillment of nature.

Returning to the *Uncarved Block*.
○ Emperor Minghuáng said: Though virtue may be noble and flourishing, one must always guard it with abasement and darkness—when things are felt and responded to appropriately, like valleys echoing sounds, receiving endlessly, and constant virtue is complete, then one returns to the Dao itself.»

The Uncarved Block is the Dao.
○ Hé said: One should return to the natural simplicity of the body, unadorned by artifice.

○ Bì said: These three statements speak of constant return to the end—only then is virtue complete. What they dwell upon is the Dao’s movement: its function cannot be seized; one must always abide in its source.

○ Máng said: The Uncarved Block illustrates the purity of nature. Nature can give rise to myriad things yet does not cling to any single form—thus it is called the Uncarved Block. Though the spirit reaches its utmost, it never departs from the Uncarved Block.

When the Uncarved Block disperses, it becomes instruments.
○ Hé said: The Uncarved Block of all things disperses and becomes tools and uses.

If the Dao disperses, it becomes divine clarity, flowing as sun and moon, dividing into the Five Phases.
○ Máng said: Once returned to the Uncarved Block, it disperses again into instruments—thus, the end becomes the beginning, the constant way of the Dao.

The Sage employs it, and it becomes officials and leaders.
○ Emperor Minghuáng said: When virtue is contained and harmonized within, it returns to the Uncarved Block. When virtue is applied, it disperses into instruments. Once engaged with form and substance, there is also depletion of essence—thus, the Sage employs it to become the officials and leaders of the people.

○ Hé said: The Sage’s elevation in use becomes the supreme leader of all officials.

○ Bì said: The Uncarved Block is the True. When the True disperses, myriad virtues emerge distinct, like instruments taking form. The Sage follows its division and dispersion, thus establishing officials and leaders—using the good as teachers, the flawed as resources—to transform customs and return to unity.

○ Máng said: The Emperor, embodying the Uncarved Block, governs dispersion, yet knowing governance is merely to serve as officials.

Thus, great governance does not harm.
○ Emperor Minghuáng said: The Sage employs the Dao to govern all life, warm as spring, its blessings everlasting. All things flourish and grow, yet nothing is harmed or cut.

○ Hé said: The Sage uses the Dao to govern the world, causing no injury or harm. In governing oneself, the Sage uses the Dao to restrain desires, lest the spirit be damaged.

○ Bì said: Great governance is to take the heart of the world as one’s own—thus there is no harm.

○ Xiù said: To govern with the Dao is to follow its natural course, adapting without constraint—thus, though governance occurs, there is no path of coercion or mutilation.

This chapter’s words on honor and shame, black and white, are profound and far-reaching—speech cannot exhaust their meaning. Let the reader ponder deeply.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Those Who Would Take the World**

Those who would take the world,
○ Hé said: To become the master of the world.

And act to do so,
○ Hé said: To govern the people with deliberate action.

I have seen that they cannot help but fail.
○ Emperor Minghuáng said: The world is the supreme treasure—its possession must await the rightful mandate. Yet those who seize it by force, through violence or chaos, are warned: *I have seen that they cannot help but fail.*

The Old Master admonished: *I have seen that they cannot help but fail.*
○ Hé said: I have seen that they have already lost the Dao and the hearts of the people. The Dao abhors complexity and filth; the people abhor excess.

○ Máng said: The Perfect One embodies the spirit, harmonizing with transformation, becoming one with all things. Though they govern the world, they never possess—thus they act effortlessly, and all undertakings succeed. Like clay shaped into vessels, they mold emperors and kings.

But those who rigidly cling to self, using self to communicate with things—even within a six-foot frame, their movements are hindered, constrained as if barely contained. How much more so for the vastness of the world?

To take is to take from things—this is the presence of self.
To act is to contrive—this is the presence of doing.
Those who possess self and act will dwell in anxiety and exhaustion—how can they govern others?

The world is a divine instrument.
○ Bì said: Divine, without form or boundary; instrument, a coalescence. Without form yet coalescing—thus it is called the divine instrument.

○ Máng said: Only when one’s essence is fully exhausted, its responses boundless, can one employ it without action.

It cannot be acted upon.
○ Hé said: Instrument, thing. Man is the divine thing of the world. Divine things prefer tranquility and cannot be governed by deliberate action.

○ Máng said: To intend action is to possess self and things.

Action ruins it.
○ Emperor Minghuáng said: The supreme treasure is the divine instrument of Heaven and Earth—thus it cannot be seized by force. Hence, *action ruins it*—a warning to treacherous ministers.

○ Hé said: To govern with deliberate action seizes its natural essence, giving rise to deceit.

○ Bì said: All things take their nature from spontaneity—thus they can be guided but not forced, known but not seized. To contrive against their nature is to ruin them. To grasp their coming and going is to lose them.

Things either move or follow,
○ Hé said: When the superior moves, the inferior follows.

Or warm or chill,
○ Hé said: *Brith* (warmth), *blow* (cold).

To warm is to have cold.
○ Hé said: Where there is warmth, there must be cold.

To strengthen is to weaken,
○ Hé said: Where there is strength, there must be weakness.

To uplift is to bury.
○ Emperor Minghuáng said: To seek clarity through force is to fail; to seize is to lose. Thus, things either move ahead or follow behind, are warmed by embrace or chilled by wind, strengthened by support or weakened by breaking—when the Dao is present, affairs prosper; when virtue is absent, they decay.

○ Hé said: *Zài* (load/fulfill), tranquility. *Chē* (car), peril. Where there is tranquility, there must be peril. The enlightened ruler cannot act with intent, whether in governing the realm or nurturing the body.

○ Pán said: The Sage’s heart transcends presence and absence, is not bound by things. Thus, yin and yang alternate, yet my teachings remain unchanging. If one acts with fixed intent, then things oppose the act, and myriad transformations entangle in endless error, beyond reckoning. Hence, the Sage moves alone in the forefront, yet remains unaware of those who follow, like form and shadow inseparable. He warms with embrace, yet does not see the cold already brought by wind, as summer and winter follow in kind. Knowing only strength, he must await the coming of weakness. Knowing only fulfillment, he finds peril at hand. These are the great rhythms of creation, the daily shifts of nature—yet those who act with fixed intent do not know them, for they fail to grasp their own nature, and thus fall into this folly. When they vie against these laws, even a single trifling thing becomes a vast burden, filling heaven and earth. How could they wield the sacred tools without encumbrance?

Thus, the Sage avoids excess, extravagance, and overreach. Emperor Minghuáng said: The Sage perceives the rise and fall of things, knowing that grasping leads to loss, so he discards their extremes.

○ Hé said: Excess is gluttony in food and indulgence in music and beauty. Extravagance is in garments, adornments, and feasting. Overreach is in palaces and pavilions. To discard these three, to dwell in moderation, to act without contrivance—then the world transforms itself.

○ Bì said: All these sayings of *hé* (or) concern the reversal of affairs, their turning and returning without ceasing. This is the error of grasping and severing. The Sage attains the utmost of nature’s course, gives free rein to all things’ inclinations, so he follows without acting, conforms without forcing, removing what confuses and casting off what misleads. Thus, his heart remains undisturbed, and the true nature of things is revealed.

○ Pán said: The Sage’s heart aligns with the void, to respond to all change. In his actions, he does not cling to schemes, like a mirror reflecting form—sufficient and then complete. What lies beyond is not his concern. Those who act with fixed intent, however, see only appearances, pride themselves in their cleverness, and labor endlessly. Thus, their deeds always overreach, for they fail to grasp the interplay of movement and following, embrace and chill, strength and weakness, fulfillment and ruin.

「**Chapter Thirty: The Dao/Way as an Aid to the Sovereign**

To aid the sovereign with the Dao/Way means that **He** (the *Zhuanxu*[1]) says: the sovereign can use the Dao/Way to govern himself. He does not rely on arms to overpower the world.

**He** says: The sovereign who governs with the Dao/Way does not use military force to subdue the world; instead, he aligns with Heaven’s virtue/power (*Wu*[2]), and the enemy submits of its own accord.

○ **Wang Bi** says: When aiding the sovereign with the Dao/Way, one should not even consider using arms to overpower the world—how much less should the sovereign himself rely on them!

○ **Wang Fan** says: One who embodies the Dao/Way and possesses the world will have all things naturally submit as guests. Why speak of this at all? Thus, it is only said that the Sage aids the sovereign with virtue/power, using arms to supplement virtue/power. But his actions favor restraint.

**The Emperor Xuanzong** says: If a subject can aid the sovereign with the Dao/Way, he should yield to virtue/power and not rely on the threat of arms. How so? Arms are instruments of violence, and war is a perilous affair. If one confronts an enemy with arms, the enemy will retaliate in kind. Thus, the cycle of vengeance begins, and the outcome of victory or defeat cannot be measured.

○ **He** says: When his actions invite retaliation, it means he does not blame others but reflects on his own faults.

○ **Wang Bi** says: For governance, one strives to achieve results and establish affairs, but one who follows the Dao/Way strives to return to non-action (*Wuwei*). Thus, it is said that his actions favor restraint.

○ **Wang Fan** says: *Return* (*Huan*) means not to persist but to seek restoration, in harmony with the principle of aligning with Heaven and governing the people without force.

Where the military strategist dwells, thorns and brambles arise.
**He** says: Farming is neglected, fields left uncultivated.

After a great army, there will surely be a year of calamity.
**The Emperor Xuanzong** says: Where the military strategist dwells, war disrupts agriculture, fields are left uncultivated, and thus thorns and brambles arise. The *qi* of war brings harm, followed by droughts and floods; agriculture is ruined first, and disasters follow. There will be years of famine and ruin.

○ **He** says: Heaven responds with malevolent *qi*, harming the five grains, and when the five grains are exhausted, it harms the people.

○ **Wang Bi** says: Arms are instruments of violence and harm; they bring no benefit but only injury. The heart is wounded, and the people are plundered, fields ravaged—thus, it is said that thorns and brambles arise.

○ **Liu Xiu** says: The cruelty of slaughter disrupts the harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth.

A virtuous warrior achieves his purpose and then rests.
**He** says: A skilled warrior must be decisive and then cease.

He does not dare to rely on conquest.
**He** says: He does not use decisiveness to claim strength or dominance.

○ **Wang Bi** says: *Decisive* (*Guo*) is akin to *fulfillment* (*Jì*). It means that a skilled warrior pursues only the resolution of difficulties, not the conquest of strength for the sake of the world.

○ **Wang Fan** says: *Decisive* (*Guo*) is *completion* (*Cheng*). He seeks only to complete the task. Arms are like Heaven’s frost and snow: all that is needed to shape things is their power, for things cannot be formed without it. Thus, Heaven and the Sage both use force to supplement virtue/power—how dare one depend on a multitude to seek strength and claim profit for oneself?

Decisive yet not arrogant,
**He** says: He must be decisive yet humble, never boastful.

Decisive yet not self-praising,
**He** says: He must be decisive yet modest, never claiming glory for himself.

Decisive yet not proud,
**The Emperor Xuanzong** says: A virtuous advisor must be decisive in repelling the enemy. But his aim is to pacify the people and harmonize the multitude; he does not dare to seek victory or claim strength. Thus, though decisive in repelling the enemy, the enemy will not become a raider. He must guard against arrogance, self-praise, and pride, lest they lead to ruin—this is a solemn warning.

○ **He** says: *Pride* (*Jiao*) is *deception* (*Qi*). A decisive warrior must not deceive others with pride.

○ **Wang Bi** says: I do not hold military force as a virtue, and only use it when unavoidable—how can there be arrogance or pride?

○ **The Emperor Xuanzong** says: These three faults arise from attachment to victory. Only those without intent to conquer can truly be said to use arms. Decisive yet not forced,

**The Emperor Xuanzong** says: When the enemy advances to invade, there is no choice but to respond with arms. Thus, decisiveness lies in repelling the enemy, not in conquering for strength.

○ **He** says: A decisive warrior must not rely on strong arms and fortified defenses to oppress others.

○ **Wang Bi** says: Though the use of arms may be decisive in achieving results and resolving difficulties, when unavoidable, it should only be employed to suppress violence and disorder—not to rely on decisiveness for the sake of conquest.

○ **Wang Fan** says: In all four cases above, the principle is to avoid force.

When things reach their peak, they grow old.
**He** says: When grass and trees reach their full vigor, they wither and fall; when a person reaches his full strength, he grows weak and aged. It means that those who rely on strength cannot endure long.

○ **Wang Fan** says: When things reach their height, they decline—this is the natural order. In ancient times, there were those who met this fate, such as Qin. This is called *not conforming to the Dao/Way*.

**The Emperor Xuanzong** says: When things rely on their peak strength, it is due to the arrogance of arms. When things reach their height, they decline; when arms grow strong, they bring defeat. This is called *not conforming to the Dao/Way*—one must cease early and not persist.

○ **Liu Xiu** says: *Peak strength* (*Zhuang*) refers to the sudden rise of military force, illustrating those who rely on arms to overpower the world. A gusting wind does not last the morning, a sudden rain does not last the day—thus, a sudden rise in arms cannot be called the Dao/Way. *Cease* (*Zao*) means *to stop* (*Yi*).

**[1]** *Zhuanxu* (傳注) – "Commentary and Transmission" (a term used for ancient annotations or interpretations of texts).
**[2]** *Wu* (德) – "Virtue/power" (as in Heaven's benevolent or harmonious influence).**

The finest weapons are ominous instruments.
**He** says: *Ominous* (*Xiáng*), virtue/power.
Weapons unsettle the spirit and turbidify harmonious *qi*—they are not instruments of virtue/power, and should not be adorned.
Things often detest them.
**He** says: When weapons are wielded, harm is done, thus all things detest them.
Therefore, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.
**Emperor Minghuang** says: *Finest* (*Jiā*), good. Weapons are stratagems. Common people refine speech and establish sincerity, yet cannot conceal their instruments with virtue/power, but instead take delight in martial stratagems. The use of stratagems lies only in conquest and slaughter, hence they are instruments of vice. Even things detest them, so those who follow the Dao do not place themselves within them.
**He** says: Those who follow the Dao do not dwell in their lands.
**Pang** says: *Do not dwell* (*Bù chǔ*) means to assist in emergencies alone, not to make it a constant practice.
Thus, the noble one at rest honors the left,
**He** says: Honoring the gentle and weak.
In war, honors the right.
**Emperor Minghuang** says: Left, *yang*. *Yang* harmony brings forth life, thus it is honored in peaceful times. Right, *yin*. *Yin* congealing brings solemnity and slaughter, thus it is honored in war.
**He** says: Honoring the strong and resolute—this speaks of martial ways contrasting with the noble’s path, differing in what is honored.
Weapons are ominous instruments,
**Emperor Minghuang** says: *Ominous*, virtue/power. Those who delight in weapons revel in slaughter, becoming instruments of vice.
**He** says: Martial implements are instruments of vice, not the noble’s tools.
**Emperor Minghuang** says: The noble relies on virtue/power as their instrument, not martial stratagems.
**He** says: Not the noble’s cherished instruments.
**Pang** says: The ruler governs with *wuwei*, the people with benevolence and kindness, thus martial prowess is not prized. Only when unavoidable is it used.
**He** says: When facing decline and chaos, disaster threatening the people, it is used for self-defense. Tranquility and simplicity are supreme.
**Emperor Minghuang** says: When barbarians invade, it is unavoidable. Victory without strife is the highest tranquility.
**He** says: Not coveting land or the wealth of others. Thus, it is not prized.
**He** says: Though victorious, it is not considered a gain or beauty. If it were prized, one would rejoice in it, and rejoicing is rejoicing in slaughter.
**He** says: Those who delight in victory are those who rejoice in killing.
**Pang** says: Weapons are meant for slaughter, yet excessively adorned, making killing seem beautiful. Thus, those who delight in killing cannot achieve their aims in the world.
**Emperor Minghuang** says: To conquer an enemy, one must pity them, thus victory is not considered beautiful. Victory must entail much slaughter; if victory is prized, it is delighting in killing many. Delighting in killing many, people will not rally to you. To seek dominance is not easy.
**He** says: For a ruler to delight in killing is to never achieve dominance in the world, to arbitrarily control life and death, and recklessly execute punishments.
**Pang** says: Mencius said: Those who do not delight in killing can unite them.
Thus, auspicious matters honor the left,
**He** says: Left, the position of life.
Calamitous matters honor the right.
**He** says: *Yin* is the way of slaughter.
Thus, the *Piān Jiāngjūn* (副将军) is placed on the left,
**He** says: The *Piān Jiāngjūn*, though lowly, resides in the *yang* position, for he does not specialize in slaughter.
The *Shàng Jiāngjūn* (上将军) is placed on the right.
**Emperor Minghuang** says: The *Piān Jiāngjūn*, though lowly, is placed on the left, for he does not specialize in slaughter. The *Shàng Jiāngjūn*, though exalted, is placed on the right, for he oversees martial stratagems.
**He** says: The *Shàng Jiāngjūn*, exalted and on the right, speaks of his mastery over slaughter. When placed in a superior position, he is treated with funeral rites.
**Emperor Minghuang** says: Funeral rites honor the right; now the *Shàng Jiāngjūn* is on the right, thus he is treated with funeral rites.
**He** says: The *Shàng Jiāngjūn* on the right, funeral rites honoring the right—deceased honor *yin*. Many are slain, thus they are mourned with sorrow.
**Emperor Minghuang** says: Given the preciousness of life, yet exchanged in battle, there is a compassionate heart, thus they are mourned with sorrow.
**He** says: This sorrow comes from virtue/power being thin, unable to transform others through the Dao, thus harming the innocent.
Victory is treated with funeral rites.
**Emperor Minghuang** says: Brave warriors, victorious in battle, receive titles and sit in the right position—honoring the right is not auspicious, thus they are treated with funeral rites. Yet, as it is an ominous instrument, what need is there for mourning? Only white mourning garments are used.
**He** says: In antiquity, victorious generals sat in mourning positions, dressed in white, weeping. The noble values virtue/power over martial might, using force only when unavoidable, yet sorrowful, comparing it to mourning. Knowing later generations would not cease using force, they grieve.
**Bi** says: Doubt this is not the work of Laozi.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Ever Nameless**

The Dao is ever nameless.
**Emperor Minghuang** says: The Dao’s constancy lies in its application, always able to respond to things, its responses not singular, thus it is nameless in constancy.
**He** says: The Dao can be *yin*, can be *yang*, can relax, can tighten, can preserve, can perish—thus it has no constant name.
**Pang** says: The Dao has no form, how then can it have a name?

Though crude and small, nothing under heaven can subdue it.
**Emperor Minghuang** says: *Crude* (*Pǔ*), the wondrous origin. The wondrous origin is refined and singular, thus it is called small. Yet in its applications, it achieves greatness, thus none dare to make the Dao their subject.
**He** says: Though the Dao is crude and small, subtle and formless, none dare to make the Dao their servant.
**Pang** says: In humans, *pǔ* is nature; in numbers, it is one. It does not dominate a single *qi*, yet can complete ten thousand forms, thus it is always before all things—who can subdue it?

「Yet taking from the singular thought of a single moment is sufficient to name it as small. The *Yijing* says: *"Returning to simplicity, yet distinguishing among things."* If lords and kings could hold fast to it, all things would willingly submit.

**Emperor Minghuang** says: If lords and kings could hold fast to the Dao in its refined singularity, act without contrivance yet transform through spontaneity, then all things would willingly submit and serve in accordance with virtue.

**He** says: If lords and kings could hold fast to the Dao in its non-action, then all things would willingly submit, obeying through the resonance of virtue.

**Pang** says: The Dao is formless and unattached, ever beyond naming, and thus it is said that the Dao is ever without name. The essence of *pǔ* lies in a mind of non-action, also without name, so those seeking the Dao should do no better than to preserve *pǔ*.

The wise can be made subjects through cunning,
The brave can be ruled through force,
The skilled can be employed through labor,
The strong can be entrusted with heavy tasks—
Yet *pǔ* is unyielding and uninclined,
Close to nothingness,
Hence it is said that none can subdue it.

Embrace *pǔ* and act without contrivance,
Do not burden your true nature with things,
Do not let desire harm your spirit—
Then all things will willingly submit,
And the Dao will be naturally attained.

**Pang** says: Submission is the act of yielding and returning to its source; if lords and kings embody this nameless *pǔ* as the standard for all under heaven, then without resorting to threats, coercion, or rewards, all things will submit naturally—just as children follow their mother. When heaven and earth harmonize, sweet dew descends.

**He** says: If the actions of lords and kings align with heaven’s harmony, then heaven will bestow auspicious blessings of sweet dew.

People submit without command,
And all is naturally balanced.

**Emperor Minghuang** says: If lords and kings could embrace and preserve this refined singularity, then earth would level and heaven would complete its course, mutual harmony would flourish, and peace would naturally arise—thus sweet dew would descend.

When sweet dew descends,
Grasses and orchids alike are nourished,
No need for instruction or command,
Yet all is balanced and equal.

Taking this as an analogy,
Lords and kings should govern by equitable application.

**He** says: When heaven sends auspicious blessings, no one needs to instruct or command—all things naturally adjust and equalize.

**Pang** says: The saying that when heaven and earth harmonize, sweet dew descends without being sought, and if I preserve my true nature in non-action, then the people will submit without being commanded.

If one governs by preserving *pǔ* in its namelessness,
Then the rising and falling of *yin* and *yang*
Will follow their natural order,
And harmonious *qi* will respond.

Sweet dew is born from the harmonious exchange of *yin* and *yang*,
Naturally distributed with equal balance,
No one compels its descent—
It is the Dao’s influence,
Unfailing in its reach.

Mencius said: *"To flow with heaven and earth above and below—is this not called the small supplement?"*
This is what he meant.

As in *Zhuangzi*, where the balance of cold and heat does not turn against and harm human form—
This is because the Dao is not lost.

The claim that *"the origin of humanity is the people"* is incorrect.
It was only when names were first established...」

The Yellow River said: *"The beginning is the Dao; names are the myriad things. The Dao, being nameless, can govern what has names; the formless can govern what has form."*

When names are established, the Sage Emperor said: *"The ruler of humanity must achieve balance through the Dao, only then can he govern the myriad things that have names. Thus, the myriad things that have names are all made to belong to the feudal lords and kings."* **"既" (jì)** means completion, exhaustion.

The Yellow River said: *"既" (jì) means completion, exhaustion. The myriad things that have names all possess desires and emotions; they rebel against the Dao and stray from virtue, hence their bodies are destroyed and dishonored.*

The Dao of cessation is also known—
The Yellow River said: *"If humanity can follow the Dao and cultivate virtue, the Dao of cessation will also naturally be understood."* Understanding cessation is how one avoids peril.

The Sage Emperor said: *"If the feudal lords and kings can govern the myriad named things, then those myriad named things will also know to submit and depend upon the feudal lords and kings. Knowing to submit to a ruler who follows the Dao is how one avoids dangerous peril."*

The Yellow River said: *"When the Dao is understood, divine numinous assistance will respond, and no peril will arise."* **Bì** said: *"The beginning of governance refers to when the undifferentiated *pǔ* first dispersed to form officials and leaders. When establishing officials and leaders, one cannot fail to set forth distinctions of rank and status to define high and low, hence the beginning of governance had names."*

Beyond this point, disputes over trifles will arise, hence it is said: *"When names are already established, humanity will also know to cease."* If one then follows names to designate things, the root of governance will be lost, hence understanding cessation is how one avoids peril.

**Pàn** said: *"Once distinctions of rank are set, the people will proceed without return, crafty schemes will proliferate, doctrines will diverge, and life and vitality will decay."* Hence, when names are first established, one must immediately know cessation, and only then will there be no peril of contention and strife.

Governance is the act of dividing the undifferentiated *pǔ* into instruments—
It is like the rivers and valleys in relation to the great seas.

The Sage Emperor said: *"Heaven sends sweet dew as a sign of blessing to those who follow the Dao, hence comparing a Dao-governed ruler to one who is at ease in the world, heaven responds to him, just as rivers and valleys flow into the great seas."*

The Yellow River said: *"This analogy speaks of the Dao’s presence in the world, harmonizing with humanity, like rivers and valleys flowing into the great seas."*

**Bì** said: *"Rivers and valleys do not seek out water, nor does the sea summon it; without summoning or seeking, it naturally returns. Those who follow the Dao in the world do not command yet achieve balance, do not seek yet obtain fulfillment, hence it is said: 'Like rivers and valleys flowing into the great seas.'"*

**Pàn** said: *"The great seas do not seek water, yet water flows to them, because the abundance of water makes their nature the same."* The Dao is the nature of the people; the Sage can gather its purity and completeness, and then all living beings will naturally come to pay homage to him, for it is their nature.

**Knowing humanity is wisdom—Chapter Thirty-Three of *Zhìzhāng***—
Knowing humanity is wisdom,

**Chapter Thirty-Four of *Zhìzhāng* — The Great Dao is Universal**

**Hé** said: *"The Dao is universal—*
Like water flowing without restraint,
As if present, as if absent,
As if seen, as if unseen—
It cannot be distinctly named.
Yet it can be applied to all sides.

**Mínghuáng** said: *"The great Dao is universal—
It has no fixed attachments yet responds to all things,
Moving freely without partiality to left or right.
○ **Hé** said: The Dao can be applied to all sides,
And is fitting in every circumstance.
○ **Bì** said: The Dao spreads far and wide,
Adapting to all things without limit,
Moving left and right, revolving and acting—
Then nothing is beyond its reach.
○ **Pàn** said: It is universal and undefined in any single thing,
Thus its application is without obstruction in all things.

**All living beings depend on it for life—*
*Depend* means they rely upon it,
For all things are sustained by the Dao
Yet it does not refuse them—

**Mínghuáng** said: *"The great Dao is universal—
It is the foundation of knowing oneself, then knowing what is precious,
Knowing what is precious, then being able to cultivate.
Cultivation lies in overcoming the selfishness of private desires.
Those who conquer their selfishness
Must first discern the distinction between inner and outer—
Then they can strengthen their resolve and advance along this Dao.
This is the order of fulfilling one’s nature and returning to the Commanding Way.

Indeed, those who know and conquer themselves
At first cannot fail to know humanity and conquer others,
But those who know and conquer others
Will ultimately seek to know and conquer themselves.
The Great Dao is Universal—Chapter Thirty-Four—

**Hé** said: *"The Dao is vast and boundless—
Like water, ever shifting,
As if present, as if not,
As if seen, as if unseen—
It cannot be distinctly named.
Yet it can be applied to all sides.

Hé said: *"The Dao does not decline to act, yet it does not forcefully obstruct.
When its work is complete, it does not claim ownership.
The Sage Emperor said: It means all things rely on the spontaneous functioning of the Dao to generate and transform, yet the Dao does not refuse to exert itself in labor. When its functions are fully realized, it does not name itself as the possessor.
Hé said: The Dao, when it acts, does not claim its merits.

It clothes and nourishes all things, yet does not rule over them.
Hé said: Though the Dao cherishes and sustains all things, it does not act like a sovereign who takes possession.
Thus, it is always without desire, and may be called *small*.
The Sage Emperor said: It cherishes all things, yet does not lord over them, having no desire for things—thus it may be called *small*. Yet this is not to say it is truly small.
Bì said: All things arise from the Dao, yet once born, they do not know their origin. Thus, in the world, there is always a time of no desire, and all things find their place. If the Dao had no relation to things, it would be called small.
Páng said: This is what is meant by *small* being truly *great*—for those who embody the Dao, desire and calculation do not arise; serene and unified within, how could this not be small? The *Yì* says: *Returning to the small, yet distinguishing among things*—one root clothes and nourishes, acting in love.

All things return to it, yet it does not know itself as sovereign.
Hé said: All things return to the Dao to receive *qi*, yet the Dao does not act like a sovereign who prohibits.
Thus, it may be called *great*.
The Sage Emperor said: It nourishes them, so all things return to it. Though there are differences among things, it does not rule over them—thus it may be called *great*. Yet this is not to say it is truly great, for it is neither small nor great—thus it is difficult to name.
Hé said: All things come and go freely, each abiding in its own place—thus it is not like the great.
Páng said: If one has intent as a sovereign, it opposes things. Only when one sovereigns over all things without ever intending to do so does one fill the boundless, and none can separate from it.

The nature of the Great Dao is such:
When it is small, it is never not great;
When it is great, it is never separate from the small.
It is only that observers perceive it differently.
In essence, it is neither small nor great—
beyond speech, yet graspable by intent.

Thus, the Sage can accomplish its greatness.
Hé said: The Sage follows the Dao, concealing virtue and hiding name, not seeking to be great.
Because it does not make itself great, it can accomplish true greatness.
The Sage Emperor said: Therefore, the Sage follows the Dao and forgets its merits, never seeking to magnify itself—thus it can accomplish its magnified work.
Hé said: The Sage leads by example, transforming without speech. All affairs are cultivated and ordered, thus it can accomplish its greatness.
Bì said: Greatness arises from the minute; difficulty from the easy.
Páng said: To claim greatness is to have greatness; having greatness is to be small. Only by not claiming greatness and yet naming it as such is true greatness achieved.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Grasping the Great Symbol**

*Grasping the Great Symbol, the world turns toward it.*
The Sage Emperor said: The Great Symbol is the Dao. When the sovereign holds fast to the Great Dao to govern the world, all things return to it.
Hé said: *Grasping* means *guarding*. *Symbol* is the Dao. The Sage guards the Great Dao, and thus all under heaven move their hearts and turn toward it. Governing oneself, one clarifies the great principles, and they come and go within oneself.
Bì said: The Great Symbol is the mother of the heavenly patterns—neither cold nor warm, neither hot nor cool—thus it can encompass and统率 all things without harm or injury. If one grasps it, then the world turns toward it.
Páng said: The sovereign embodies the Dao, ruling with an unseen presence, allowing all under heaven to roam freely in self-realization. The Great Symbol is the complete, formless embodiment of the Dao.

If one grasps it to govern the world,
Praise and blame do not reach it—
It sends forth, yet does not call back.
How could it be compared to the stench of rotting meat?
It sends forth without harming.
Páng said: When the Sage governs the world, even if treasures are exchanged like discarded things, with no action from above, it allows heaven, earth, ghosts, beasts, grasses, and trees to flourish in their nature without mutual harm—this is true virtue.

Thus, it is peaceful, stable, and flourishing.
The Sage Emperor said: If things follow their nature without harm, they rest in peace and flourish.
Hé said: When all things turn toward it without harm, the state is secure, families are at ease, and great peace is achieved. Governing the body without harming the spirit, the body is secure and long-lived.
Bì said: Formless and unperceived, neither partial nor prominent—thus all things can turn toward it without harm or obstruction.
Páng said: First, there is peace; then, there is stability; then, there is flourishing.

Music and delicacies—
Passing guests will stop.
The Sage Emperor said: *Music* refers to music; *delicacies* to food and drink. It means that when a household has music and food, passing guests will linger.
Another explanation: Music gathers through sound; delicacies through flavor. Passing guests may pause briefly, but not for long.
Thus, even connected dwellings cannot be long inhabited—
Ren and righteousness bring many demands,
So the sovereign, embodying the Dao in tranquility and simplicity,
At first removes the scrutinizing governance,
And finally transforms the people into a pure and harmonious state.
Thus, the text concludes: *Its use cannot be exhausted.*

Hé said: *Delicacies* means *beauty*. *Passing guests* are *one*—when people delight in the beauty of the Dao, they pause as one. *One* means to depart from fullness and dwell in emptiness, drifting like passing guests.
Páng said: There is sound and flavor, so people take pleasure and linger.

The Dao’s spoken expression is
Dull and without taste.
The Sage Emperor said: The sovereign teaches with moral cultivation and tranquility. At first, when spoken, it is dull and without taste—unlike the common teachings of praise and blame.

The Dao enters and exits through speech,
Dull—dull, not like the five flavors with their sour, salty, bitter, sweet, and spicy tastes.
To gaze upon it is insufficient to see,
Hé said: *Sufficient* means *obtained*.
The Dao is formless, unlike the five colors—green, yellow, red, white, and black—which can be obtained by sight.

To listen to it is insufficient to hear,
Hé said: The Dao is not like the five tones—*gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*—which can be obtained by hearing.

Its use cannot be exhausted.
The Sage Emperor said: With the Dao as steadfast tranquility, initially there is no spoken teaching. Thus, to gaze upon it is insufficient to see, to listen to it is insufficient to hear, yet pure customs flourish, all things thrive abundantly, and the year’s harvests overflow—thus its use cannot be exhausted. *Exhausted* means *fully spent*.

Hé said: When the Dao governs the state, the state is secure and the people prosper; when applied to the self, life is prolonged without end.

Pì said: This speaks of the Dao’s profound greatness. When people hear its words, they find them less appealing than music or delicacies, yet they spontaneously move and delight the heart in response to the times. Music and delicacies can make passing guests pause, but the Dao’s spoken expression is dull and without taste—insufficient to please the eye when gazed upon, insufficient to delight the ear when heard. If it seems to lack appeal, its use is yet inexhaustible.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: When One Would Gather, One Must First Spread**—
When one would gather, one must first spread it wide.

Hé said: *"He who first spreads it wide seeks to exhaust its excess and decadence.*
*When one would weaken it, one must first strengthen it.*
Hé said: *He who first strengthens it seeks to bring upon it misfortune and calamity.*
*When one would destroy it, one must first raise it up.*
Hé said: *He who first raises it seeks to make it proud and perilous.*
*When one would take from it, one must first give to it.*
Hé said: *He who first gives to it seeks to exhaust its greedy heart."*

Pī said: *"The interplay of yin and yang revolves like a turning wheel, reverses like a saw’s pull—when it reaches its extreme, it must return; when it is at its fullest, it must decline. Observe the moon’s waning after fullness, the sun’s reversal at its zenith, and one sees that all things conform to this principle, which is undeniably clear. Only the sage deeply grasps the masterful mechanism, understanding the formless Dao, thus:
In nurturing life, he adapts to contraction and expansion;
In conducting himself, he aligns with growth and decline;
In managing affairs, he knows the strategies of success and failure;
In confronting enemies, he masters the tactics of capture and release.
The ancients thus responded to myriad transformations with effortless ease—this is truly the Dao’s subtlety, which even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom, let alone the common folk. The *Yijing* says:
*The bending of the inchworm seeks its stretching;
The coiling of the dragon and serpent preserves its life.*
This is called *micro-enlightenment*.
The Sage Emperor said: *The *Yijing* states: ‘Upright speech seems contrary,’ and ‘The compliant can act with flexibility.’ Flexibility is what appears contrary to principle yet aligns with righteousness. Thus, the noble act with flexibility while adhering to righteousness, while the petty use it for deceit and trickery. Confucius said: ‘One may stand with him, but cannot act with flexibility.’ Truly so.
Thus, the Old Master in the previous chapter demonstrated *embracing the Great Image*—this is called *substance*. This chapter follows with *gathering and spreading*—this is called *flexibility*. To measure the empty root of nature, he covers substance with flexibility, revealing their interplay and leading back to the realm of life and death. Yet the confused say, ‘Those who forget morality and virtue are lost’—how deluded they are!
To gather and restrain the desires of all beings, one must first spread them wide, exhausting their extravagant hearts, so that they themselves become entangled in love and desire—then restraint follows. The principles of strength and weakness are similarly applied. This Dao is exceedingly subtle, yet its effects are clearly manifest, hence it is called *micro-enlightenment*.
Hé said: *These four matters are subtle in their Dao, yet their effects are clear.*
Pī said: *To remove the strong and violent, to eliminate chaos, one must use these four methods, exploiting the nature of things so that they destroy themselves. Hence it is called micro-enlightenment. When their spreading is sufficient, yet they still demand more, they become like the image of contraction. If their spreading is insufficient and they change, those who seek more will only grow bolder, while one’s own position becomes perilous.*

Pī said: *This principle is subtle yet clear; only those who discern the early signs can recognize it. The *Yijing* says: ‘To know the early signs is divine.’ The early signs are the subtle movements that precede good fortune. This is the marvelous application of the Dao, by which sages govern and command, aligning with the transformations of nature. Hence, this chapter concludes the *Dao Jing* with its meaning.
The compliant overcomes the rigid; the weak overcomes the strong.*
The Sage Emperor said: *The compliant and yielding can act with flexibility; flexibility in action allows one to control things, thus knowing that the weak and compliant must overcome the rigid and strong.*
Hé said: *The compliant endure long, while the rigid perish swiftly.*
Pī said: *Observing form reveals how the rigid dominate the compliant, but understanding principle reveals how the compliant overcome the rigid. The sage deeply grasps the meaning of micro-enlightenment, thus remaining modest without arrogance, empty without excess, not contending with others—yet none can contend with him either.
Nevertheless, this Dao is but a spoken principle. As for ever-changing transformations, who can define which is rigid or compliant, which is weak or strong? Even if rigid and strong, if the compliant and weak do not prevail, it is because their actions align with principle while their hearts never stray from compliance and weakness. From this, one again knows that the compliant and weak overcome the rigid and strong.
These two are called *sharp instruments*—one version reads: ‘The compliant and weak overcome the rigid and strong.’
A fish cannot escape from the depths.*
Hé said: *A fish escaping the depths is to leave rigidity for compliance—it can never return.*
*A state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.*
The Sage Emperor said: *Escape means loss. Sharp instruments refer to the Dao of flexibility. The Dao of flexibility must not be revealed to those unworthy, hence the analogy: A fish lost from the depths will surely be taken by others; if the Dao of flexibility is shown to the unworthy, it will be stolen for deceit and trickery.*
Hé said: *Sharp instruments are the Dao of flexibility. Those who wield state flexibility must not reveal it to their ministers; what should not be spoken must not be revealed to the unworthy.*
Pī said: *Sharp instruments are instruments beneficial to the state, using only the nature of things without relying on form to govern them. If the instrument is unseen yet all things find their place, then it is the state’s sharp instrument. To show it to others is to employ coercion; coercion for the state’s benefit will fail. A fish escaping the depths will surely be lost; if the state’s sharp instrument is displayed in form to others, it will also surely be lost.*
Pī said: *The fish yields to compliance and weakness, hiding itself in the deepest recesses to preserve its life. The sage retreats into obscurity yet wields supreme flexibility, alone directing countless transformations beyond measure. Thus, he turns the heavens and earth with effortless power, yet the world sees no trace of his influence; his might subdues the realm, yet none can name its source. How could he expose his divine essence and let the masses debate it?
I have privately reasoned: What distinguishes the sage from others is his discernment of early signs. If one meets things with rigidity, those things’ rigidity becomes an insurmountable foe. All under heaven believe rigidity overcomes things, yet I alone dwell in the realm of compliant non-contention. When I act, who can resist me?"*

「Behold the Dao of Heaven, and it is clear that autumn and winter are the counterparts to spring and summer—this too is a truth. The sage hides himself in the deepest recesses, yet appears as compliant and weak, thus guiding all things within the unseen realm of technique, so that none can fathom his origin. This is what is called *the subtle and solitary transformation* (密用独化).

*The I Ching* says: *"The infant moves with power"* (婴以行权), and *Zhuangzi* says: *"From the fish, one gains strategy"* (於鱼得计). Their meaning aligns here, though their words may be elaborate, none can truly name its essence.

Only the enlightened, with divine insight, comprehend it and grasp its intent—then it suffices.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao of Non-Action (道常无为)**

The Dao ever abides in non-action.
*River* (河) says: *"The Dao regards things as evil when they are contrived."* (道以物为恶常也)
*Bì* (弼) says: *"It follows the natural order."* (顺自然也)
*Fán* (雱) says: *"Even when it acts, it never truly acts—yet nothing remains unacted upon."* (虽为之时，未尝有为，而无不为)

*Bì* says: *"All things are without fail governed and perfected through its action."* (万物无不由为以治以成之也)

*Fán* says: *"Though it appears as non-action, it never ceases to act."* (虽无为之时，未尝不为)

If lords and kings could uphold it,
*Fán* says: *"The ruler embodies the Dao to govern, thus relying on the seasons and their intrinsic principles without intent to act. Though he appears as non-action, he does not neglect the world’s affairs, yet truly, he never acts at all."* (君人体道以治，则因时乘理而无意於为，故虽无为而不废天下之为，而吾实未尝为也)

What does Heaven speak of? The four seasons pass, and all things flourish. (天何言哉，四时行焉，万物生焉)
The Dao of lords and kings is surely complete in Heaven. (侯王之道，天其尽之矣)
All things shall transform of their own accord. (万物将自化)

*Emperor Minghuáng* (明皇) says: *"The profound origin lies in stillness, hence the Dao of non-action."* (妙本谓静，故常无为)
Things shall be born, yet the Dao never ceases to act. (物将以生，而无不为也)
If lords and kings could uphold the Dao of non-action, then all things shall transform spontaneously. (侯王若能守道无为，则万物自化)
The ruler’s non-action is thus pure and unadorned. (君之无为，而纯朴矣)

*River* says: *"Speaking of lords and kings upholding the Dao, all things shall transform spontaneously—this is marvelous in itself."* (言侯王若能守道，万物将自化，妙於己也)

*Fán* says: *"They transform daily in the Dao yet remain unaware."* (日化於道而不知)

When transformation seeks expression,
*Fán* says: *"If transformation progresses daily like a child’s growth, it must reach a point where will and intent swell, and Heaven’s harmony wanes. Observe the mid-period of the Three Dynasties (三代中流): as things became refined and worn, this truth becomes evident."* (化而欲作，雱曰：化而日进则如婴儿之长，必至於志意充起，天和渐衰，观夫三代中流，物情雕敝，则可知也)

I shall restrain it with the nameless purity. (吾将镇以无名之朴)

*Emperor Minghuáng* says: *"When people follow the ruler’s transformation, they remain in non-action and stillness, yet if they then seek to move or contrive, I shall restrain them with the nameless purity."* (言人既从君上之化，已无为清静，而复欲动作有为者，吾将以无名之朴而镇静之)
The nameless purity is the Dao. (无名之朴，道也)

*River* says: *"I (the ruler) am the body (身), the nameless purity is the Dao."* (吾，身也，无名之朴，道也)
All things transform, yet their effect is mine. (万物以化，效於己也)
If they further seek to craft deceits, the lord and king must restrain them with virtue and power (道德)." (复欲作巧伪者，侯王当身镇抚以道德)

*Fán* says: *"Once the world has transformed under the Dao, governance advances daily. When governance reaches its peak, names and realities are fixed, and the people, drawn onward, never return. Thus, one must always embrace the nameless purity to steady their will and intent, guiding them back to their original nature. Though this may rescue what has already been formed, it is already too late."* (天下既化於道，则日进於治，治极则名实俱立，民逐而不返，故常抱无名之朴以镇定其志意，使一於性本，虽然救於已成，则亦晚矣)

Therefore, at the moment they seek to act,
*Bì* says: *"When transformation nears completion, I shall restrain it with the nameless purity—yet I shall not be its master."* (化而欲作，作欲成也，吾将镇之以无名之朴，不为主也)
I shall also not desire. (亦将不欲)
*Bì* says: *"Not desiring means no competition."* (无欲竞也)

*Xiù* (秀) says: *"The sage’s embrace of purity and non-action is his natural state. Thus, though he responds to the world’s changes and entangles himself in affairs, he never departs from it. How could he desire to warn the world of disorder and then act? If one acts because they desire to act, they already possess the reality of contrived desire—how could this be the true nameless purity? Only the one who remains undivided and unaware yet naturally so, does not seek to be pure but remains ever pure."* (圣人之抱朴无为，乃其自然，故虽应世之变，纠纷於事物之时，未尝离也，岂欲警天下之乱而后为之哉。 夫欲为而为之，则据此已有为欲之实，岂真无名之朴欤。 唯浑然常一，不知其然而自然者，不期为朴而朴常全也)

Not desiring through stillness. (不欲以静)
*River* says: *"The lord and king restrains with virtue and power (道德), yet the people shall not desire to change. One must lead them with stillness and purity."* (言侯王镇抚以道德，民亦将不欲改，当以清静导化之也)

The world shall rectify itself. (天下将自正)

*Emperor Minghuáng* says: *"When the ruler restrains the people with the nameless purity, he must not cling to it lest they find a path (逵) to deviate. If he fears they will advance and lose their root, or fall back into contrivance, he must also forget this purity. Not desiring in non-desire, non-desire is forgotten. Thus, tranquil and still, the world rectifies itself."* (言人君既以无名之朴镇静苍生，不可执此无名之朴而令有逵，将恐寻进丧本，复入有为，故於此无名之朴，亦将兼忘，不欲於无欲，无欲亦忘，泊然清静，而天下自正矣)

*Fán* says: *"If one desires and acts, they stray from their nature. Straying from nature is not rectification—how could one who is not yet rectified rectify the world?"* (欲而动则离性，离於性则非正也，己且未正，安能正天下哉)
Thus, only the still and non-desiring can rectify themselves and thereby rectify all things. (故唯不欲而静者，能正己而物正也)

This is the Dao’s efficacy, yet the Dao is also lost here. (此为道之效，而道亦丧於此)
Thus, the Daoist Classic concludes. (故道经终焉)

**Volume Six of the *Zhuangzi* with *Dao* Commentaries (道德真经集注卷之六)**

*Emperor Minghuáng* (明皇), *River* (河), *Bì* (王弼), and *Fán* (王雱) commentaries.»

**Chapter Thirty-Eight of the *Dao De Jing* with *Dao* Commentaries (上德不德章第三十八)**

**上德不德** (The Supreme Virtue/Power Does Not Virtue/Power)
*River* (河) says: "Supreme Virtue/Power refers to the sovereign of the primordial age, before names were established. Their Virtue/Power was boundless and without equal, hence 'Supreme Virtue/Power.' To say they did not Virtue/Power means they did not use Virtue/Power to instruct the people. Instead, they followed nature spontaneously, nurturing the lives and essences of all things. Their Virtue/Power was not overtly displayed, hence 'did not Virtue/Power.' Thus, they possessed Virtue/Power.
*River* (河) says: "Their Virtue/Power harmonized with Heaven and Earth, blending *qi* in seamless flow, allowing the people to thrive fully. Thus, they truly had Virtue/Power.
*Fán* (王雱) says: "The person of complete Virtue/Power embodies the Dao fully and exhausts the constants of nature. Beyond Virtue/Power, there is nothing else to be seen—thus, no name of Virtue/Power remains. The Supreme Virtue/Power does not display Virtue/Power, for it is already complete.

**下德不失德** (Lower Virtue/Power Does Not Lose Virtue/Power)
*River* (河) says: "Lower Virtue/Power refers to the sovereign of the named age, whose Virtue/Power does not reach the level of the Supreme Virtue/Power, hence 'Lower Virtue/Power.' To say they do not lose Virtue/Power means their Virtue/Power is visible, and their achievements can be praised. Thus, they lack Supreme Virtue/Power.
*Emperor Minghuáng* (明皇) says: "Virtue/Power is the application of the Dao. *Zhuangzi* says: 'When things are allowed to flourish, it is called Virtue/Power.' In the pure and ancient times, Virtue/Power was not yet manifest, and there was no name for it—thus, it was called 'did not Virtue/Power.' Yet their pure Virtue/Power did not disperse; their non-action refined the transformation, hence 'thus, they possessed Virtue/Power.' When Virtue/Power declined, its functions became more pronounced, though the heart still embodied the Dao. The traces, however, involved some action—thus, they could be named as Virtue/Power, hence 'did not lose.' The traces involved action; thus, this is inferior to the Supreme, hence 'thus, they lacked Supreme Virtue/Power.'
*River* (河) says: "They established names and titles for themselves.
*Fán* (王雱) says: "When Virtue/Power reaches its fullness, it transcends the name of Virtue/Power. The people of Lower Virtue/Power merely attain the Virtue/Power of their age—this is not the Virtue/Power spoken of by the Supreme Sage.

**上仁为之** (The Supreme Benevolence Acts)
*River* (河) says: "Supreme Benevolence refers to the sovereign who practices benevolence without limit, hence 'Supreme Benevolence.' To say they act means they act with benevolent grace. Yet they do not cling to benevolence.
*Emperor Minghuáng* (明皇) says: "Benevolence is the name for universal love. When Lower Virtue/Power declines, Supreme Benevolence appears, acting as universal love. Thus, they act with benevolence. Yet in practicing benevolence, they forget benevolence, also desiring to attain non-action. Thus, they do not cling to benevolence—this is when the heart acts, yet the traces do not.
Yet, the Supreme Benevolence is called non-action, for it seeks to align with the Supreme Way by appearing without action, though it cannot yet speak to the action of Lower Virtue/Power.
*River* (河) says: "When achievements are complete and affairs established, there is nothing to cling to as Virtue/Power.
*Fán* (王雱) says: "Benevolence is the longest form of goodness, another name for Virtue/Power. Since it is distinct from Virtue/Power, it is called 'acting.' Yet the Sage’s benevolence is complete in nature and requires no further cultivation—thus, they do not cling to it.

**上义为之** (The Supreme Righteousness Acts)
*River* (河) says: "Righteousness acts by distinguishing and severing.
Thus, they do cling to righteousness.
*Emperor Minghuáng* (明皇) says: "Righteousness means to judge what is wrong. It is called 'acting' because they judge what is wrong. Yet they cling to righteousness to distinguish and sever, allowing things to find their proper place—this is when both the heart and traces involve action.
*River* (河) says: "They move and act for themselves, killing others to establish their authority, and plundering the lower to sustain themselves.
*Fán* (王雱) says: "When benevolence is insufficient, they resort to righteousness.

**上礼为之** (The Supreme Ritual Acts)
*River* (河) says: "Supreme Ritual refers to the sovereign whose ritual is without limit, hence 'Supreme Ritual.' To say they act means they establish ritual systems, measures, and ceremonial decorum. Yet these are not responded to.
*River* (河) says: "Their rituals are extravagant in form yet lacking in substance, filled with falsehood and complexity, and any movement departs from the Dao—thus, they are not responded to. Then they roll up their sleeves and enforce them.
*Emperor Minghuáng* (明皇) says: "When the six relationships are not harmonized, they act with rituals to remedy them. Rituals emphasize reciprocity—if there is no reciprocity, it is not ritual. When they perform rituals upon others, yet others do not respond, they roll up their sleeves in anger and enforce them, drawing others along by force."

「○ *River* says: When rituals become excessive and unanswered, the sovereign and subjects clash in anger, thus they roll up their sleeves and drag one another into contention.

○ *Páng* says: Rituals serve to establish the hierarchy between sovereign and subjects, distinguish near and distant relationships, and determine what is exalted or diminished. Through myriad distinctions, gains and losses become apparent. Yet when sincerity is lost, external forms are fabricated. Once these forms are rigidly enforced, expectations deepen. Though rituals may be named as tools to curb vice, in truth they become the seeds of strife.

I have observed that rituals, like fire, are essential to material existence, yet their proper season is summer—when all things depart from their roots and flourish at their extremities. Examining the four seasons, one sees that rituals are unavoidable even for the Sage. If the aim is to return to the root and abandon the extremities, then condemning rituals is also unavoidable. The Sage’s teaching adapts to the times—what constancy can there be? Yet the call to return to the root is crucial for the learner.

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises.
*River* says: When the Dao declines, virtuous transformation emerges.

When virtue is lost, benevolence arises.
*River* says: When virtue fades, loving-kindness becomes manifest.

When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises.
*River* says: When benevolence wanes, distinctions of righteousness clarify.

When righteousness is lost, rituals emerge.
*Emperor Minghuáng* says: To lose the Dao is to lose the highest virtue—since the highest virtue aligns with the Dao, it is called losing the Dao.

Virtue, morality, benevolence, and righteousness are merely the names for the times’ simplicity or complexity. Thus, when the Dao declines, virtue appears; when virtue is lost, benevolence remains; when benevolence vanishes, righteousness is established; when righteousness is abandoned, rituals intervene—these are but adaptations to the times.

Therefore, discussing rituals in an age of purity and simplicity is either madness or heresy, while forgetting rituals in an age of corruption and decadence is either folly or deceit. If one can dissolve and transform them, they should retreat from rituals and practice righteousness, retreat from righteousness and practice benevolence, retreat from benevolence and practice virtue, and forget virtue to merge with the Dao. When people return to simplicity, the highest virtue manifests in non-action.

Rituals are the thinning of sincerity and trust—
*River* says: Rituals abandon the root to govern the extremities, causing sincerity and trust to dwindle daily—
and the origin of chaos.
*Emperor Minghuáng* says: Those who establish rituals do so because sincerity and trust have weakened, making rituals the first cause of disorder.

The use of rituals lies in pacifying the sovereign and ordering the people—what need is there for jade and silk?

○ *River* says: Rituals value form over substance, so uprightness diminishes while deceit and disorder flourish.

○ *Páng* says: The Dao of antiquity descended into imperial virtue, and imperial virtue further descended to become the rule of kings. Only then did kings begin to rely on rituals for governance. Since the age of kings, the customs of the world have become apparent. Thus, the claim that rituals are the first cause of chaos is no mere fabrication.

Foreknowledge is the ornament of the Dao—
*River* says: To speak of knowledge before attaining it is foreknowledge—this is the true loss of the Dao and the superficial attainment of its ornament. It is the beginning of folly.
*Emperor Minghuáng* says: Foreknowledge refers to human perception—it means imposing these external checks on ritual before the natural unfolding of human perception. Though it may seem to dull the times, it actually erodes simplicity, hence it is the ornament of the Dao.

Rituals, meant to curb chaos, seek harmony, yet those who violate ritual intent will prize jade and silk while their people become deceitful. Such is the nature of human folly—its beginning lies in ritualistic pretense.

○ *River* says: Those with foreknowledge are the instigators of ignorance.

○ *Páng* says: Wisdom resides in the virtue of assisting others, just as the essence of plants manifests in their blossoms. Though blossoms may beautify a moment, their abundance signals the decline of the root. Wisdom is also the essence of virtue, naturally meant to be deeply rooted, yet it is exposed externally as foreknowledge.

All things follow their natural course. When their time arrives, they respond—why anticipate their signs in advance? Through myriad distinctions, one displays cleverness, and the world sees this as prescience. Yet the Sage regards it as the beginning of true folly.

Confucius said: *"Do not anticipate deceit, nor presume upon dishonesty—how I detest mere superficiality!"*

Thus, the virtuous person abides in substance—
*River* says: The virtuous person, meaning the sovereign who has attained the Dao, abides in substance.
To abide in substance is to abide in sincerity and trust—
*River* says: Not to place oneself in contradiction to the Dao, lest the world become embroiled in turmoil.
And not in ornament.
*Emperor Minghuáng* says: Action is the thinning of the Dao. Rituals and righteousness are the ornaments of virtue. Therefore, the Sage engages in non-action, abiding in substance rather than ornament. Retreating from the practice of rituals and righteousness, one naturally returns to sincerity and trust.

○ *River* says: Do not exalt speech.

Thus, discard the superficial and take the substantial.
*Emperor Minghuáng* agrees with *River*’s commentary.

○ *River* says: Abandon the superficial and ornamental, embrace the substantial and real.

○ *Bì* says: Virtue is that which is attained—constantly possessed without loss, beneficial without harm, hence it is called *virtue*.

How does one attain virtue? Through the Dao.
How does one fully realize virtue? Through non-action.

To employ non-action means all things are carried within it. Thus, without it, nothing escapes its influence; with it, nothing suffices to preserve life. Therefore, though heaven and earth are vast, they govern with non-action at their core, and though the Sage-King is great, they rule with emptiness as their foundation.

Thus, it is said: *"To restore and observe is to perceive the heart of heaven and earth; to reflect upon it at the zenith of the sun is to behold the essence of the ancient kings."*

Therefore, to extinguish selfishness and lose the self is to have all under heaven gaze in reverence, near and far flocking without end. To distinguish oneself and harbor intentions is to fail to preserve even one’s own body—flesh and bone cannot coexist in harmony. Hence, those of the highest virtue use only the Dao, without clinging to virtue, without grasping or employing it. Thus, they possess virtue yet perform no deeds, attain without seeking, accomplish without acting—though they have virtue, they bear no name of virtue.*»

The lesser virtue seeks and obtains, acts and accomplishes—thus establishing goodness to govern things, and so the name of virtue arises.

To seek and obtain is to necessarily lose something; to act and accomplish is to necessarily fail. When the name of goodness emerges, evil inevitably follows. Thus, the lesser virtue acts and yet still clings to its deeds.

Those who do not cling to deeds act without partiality.

All who cannot act without acting are of lesser virtue—such are *rén* (仁), *yì* (義), *lǐ* (禮), and *jié* (節).

To distinguish between higher and lower virtue, one must contrast lesser virtue with greater virtue. When one reaches the point of not clinging to deeds, they have exhausted the measure of lesser virtue—this is the highest *rén* (仁).

Yet even when one reaches the point of not clinging to deeds, they still act. To act without clinging is to exhaust all deeds.

The root lies in *wuwei* (無為), the mother in *wu* (無名). To abandon the root and grasp the child, though the deed be great, it will inevitably fail. Though the name be beautiful, deceit will inevitably arise. If one cannot accomplish without acting, cannot govern without exertion, then one must act. Thus, those who practice vast, universal, and generous benevolence, yet love without partiality, are those who act without clinging.

If love cannot be all-encompassing, then there arise those who uphold justice, righteousness, and principle—those who resent injustice, aid the wronged, and assist others in their affairs, yet still act with intent. Thus, the highest *yì* (義) acts while clinging to deeds.

If righteousness cannot prevail, then there arise those who praise, adorn, and revere—those who value propriety and respect, who scrutinize and criticize, and from whom anger arises when not met. Thus, the highest *lǐ* (禮) acts, yet none respond, so they force compliance.

The ultimate extreme is the Dao alone. From this point onward, what is there to revere?

Thus, even if virtue is abundant and deeds are great, possessing all things, each still has its own virtue and cannot encompass all. Therefore, heaven cannot be the vehicle, earth cannot be the cover, and humanity cannot be the reverence. Though all things are precious, if they are used with *wuwei*, they cannot grasp the essence of not clinging.

To fail to grasp the essence of not clinging is to lose what is great. This is called "losing the Dao and then having virtue."

To use *wuwei* is to honor the mother of virtue, thus able to act without labor while things are governed. Below this, one loses the mother of use—unable to act with *wuwei* while valuing universal benevolence, unable to value universal benevolence while valuing righteousness, unable to value righteousness while valuing adornment and respect. This is called "losing virtue and then having *rén*, losing *rén* and then having *yì*, losing *yì* and then having *lǐ*."

For *lǐ* is where it begins: when sincerity and trust are not deep, when simplicity and openness are not thorough, when criticism is superficial, and when subtle conflicts arise. Benevolence and righteousness arise from within, yet their actions are still false—how much more so when they merely adorn externally and expect endurance? Thus, those who violate *lǐ* are deficient in sincerity and trust, and this is the origin of chaos.

The wise of old were those who foresaw and recognized—those of lesser virtue. They exhausted their intelligence for foresight, labored their wisdom for affairs, though they grasped the situation, their deceit grew ever more refined. Though they amassed praise, they lost sincerity. Though they labored, their governance became corrupt. Though they exhausted their wisdom, the people suffered more. To abandon oneself and entrust to things is to act with *wuwei* and attain tranquility; to cling to simplicity and naturalness is to disregard established norms. To heed what is gained while abandoning what is held—this is the flower of Dao, yet the root of folly.

If one obtains the mother of deeds, then all things act without refusal, all affairs are preserved without labor. To use without form, to govern without name—thus *rén* and *yì* can be manifest, *lǐ* and respect can be clear.

To bear upon the great Dao, to settle with *wu* (無名), then things have nothing to revere, the will has nothing to scheme. Each fulfills its integrity, affairs rely on sincerity—thus virtue is thick, righteousness is upright, and respect is pure.

To abandon what bears them, to forsake what generates them, to use what is formed, to labor with intelligence—then benevolence loses sincerity, righteousness becomes competitive, and respect becomes contentious. Thus, the thickness of virtue is not achieved by using *rén*, the uprightness of righteousness is not accomplished by using *yì*, and the purity of respect is not attained by using *lǐ*.

To bear upon the Dao, to unify with the mother—thus to manifest without reverence, to clarify without competition. To use the nameless, so names are sincere; to use the formless, so forms are complete. To guard the mother to preserve the child, to exalt the root to raise the branch—then form and name are both present, yet evil does not arise. Great beauty aligns with heaven, yet no artificiality emerges. Thus, the mother cannot be distant, the root cannot be lost. *Rén* and *yì* are what the mother generates, yet they cannot be the mother. Form and instruments are what the artisan creates, yet they cannot be the artisan.

To grasp the mother while using the child, to abandon the root while pursuing the branch—then names will have divisions, forms will have limits. Though extreme in greatness, there will inevitably be gaps. Though abundant in beauty, there will inevitably be suffering. Deeds lie in action—how can they suffice?

○ *Yún* said: To extricate oneself from the common flow and strive to emulate the virtue of the Sage-King—who among true great men can do this?

From the chapter *"The Ancient Who Obtained the One"* (第三十九) *"The Ancient Who Obtained the One"*...

「Emperor Minghuang said: *One* is the harmony of the Dao/Way, referring to the *chōng qì* [pure, unstructured qi]. Since its wondrous application lies in all things as *One*, it is thus called *One*.

○ **Hé** said: *Xī* [ancient] means *past*, and *One* is the *unmanifest* [wuwei], the child of the Dao/Way.

○ **Bì** said: *Xī* [ancient] means *beginning*, and *One* is the origin of numbers while also the ultimate of things. Each attains *One* as the principle of its generation, thus becoming the master. Once things attain this *One*, they are formed—then they abandon *One* to dwell in their completed state. Dwelling in completion means losing their mother, and thus all things split, wither, and falter.

The heavens obtain *One* to become clear,
○ **Hé** said: The heavens obtain *One*, thus able to manifest the *symbols* [of the cosmos] in purity and clarity.

the earth obtains *One* to become tranquil,
○ **Hé** said: The earth obtains *One*, thus able to remain stable and unmoving in quietude.

the spirits obtain *One* to become numinous,
○ **Hé** said: The spirits obtain *One*, thus able to transform and act without form.
○ **Yún** said: *Spirits* refers to the *ghost-spirits* [guishen]. *Numinous* is the scattering of the spirits.

the valleys obtain *One* to become full,
○ **Hé** said: The valleys obtain *One*, thus able to remain overflowing without exhaustion.
○ **Yún** said: *One* as *One* is nowhere absent—thus, the valleys, though empty, can respond, for *One* abides within.

all things obtain *One* to generate,
○ **Hé** said: All things must rely on the Dao/Way to arise and take form.

and the feudal lords obtain *One* to uphold the *perennial* [zhēn] virtue of the world.
○ **Hé** said: The feudal lords obtain *One*, thus able to bring stability and rectitude to the world.

Their attainment of *One* is this.

Emperor Minghuang said: Things obtain the Dao/Way through its application, and names are established based on this application. When the Dao/Way is present, names stand; when the application is lost, reality is forfeited. Thus, the heavens’ clarity, the earth’s tranquility, the spirits’ numinousness, the valleys’ fullness, and all things’ generation—all arise from the wondrous application of *One*, hence the saying, *Their attainment of One is this*.

○ **Hé** said: *Attainment* is also *admonition* [zhì]. It refers to the five matters below.

○ **Bì** said: Each attains this clarity, tranquility, numinousness, perenniality, fullness, and generation through its own *One*.

○ **Yún** said: *One* is undivided—present in all and everywhere. Its principle is ever *One*, without separate *Ones*—thus, only *One* can attain *One*; no other means can attain *One*.

The meaning of *One* is the utmost *precision* [of the cosmos], and only through *precision* can it become numinous. When numinous, it is fully realized, and yet the numinous as *virtue/power* [dé] remains ever in *One*.

If the heavens were to cling to clarity alone, they would risk splitting;
○ **Hé** said: The heavens must have the interplay of *yin-yang* [opposing forces], the expansion and contraction of day and night—if they were to seek only clarity without end, they would risk dividing and failing to be the heavens.

○ **Bì** said: The Dao/Way is used to attain clarity, not clarity to attain clarity. To preserve *One* is to attain clarity; to lose the application of clarity risks splitting. Thus, it is the foundation of deeds, and cannot be abandoned.

Hence, all things fear losing their foundation through neglect of their application.

If the earth were to cling to tranquility alone, it would risk erupting;
○ **Hé** said: The earth must have *high and low, firm and yielding*, the rhythms of the *Five Phases* [wu xing]—if it were to seek only tranquility without end, it would risk upheaval and failing to be the earth.

If the spirits were to cling to numinousness alone, they would risk ceasing;
○ **Hé** said: The spirits must have *kings and ministers, imprisonment and death, rest and decay*—if they were to seek only numinousness without end, they would risk stagnation.

If the valleys were to cling to fullness alone, they would risk drying up;
○ **Hé** said: The valleys must have *overflow and contraction, emptiness and substance*—if they were to seek only fullness without end, they would risk exhaustion and failing to be the valleys.

If all things were to cling to generation alone, they would risk annihilation;
○ **Hé** said: All things must follow the *seasons* [shí] in their birth and death—if they were to seek only generation without end, they would risk perishing and failing to be things.

If the feudal lords were to cling to their nobility alone, while seeking loftiness, they would risk faltering.

Emperor Minghuang said: Those who obtain *One* must not pride themselves in its application, lest they falter. The heavens must not cling to their clarity, lest they split; the earth must not cling to its tranquility, lest it erupt; the spirits must not cling to their numinousness, lest they cease; the valleys must not cling to their fullness, lest they dry up; all things must not cling to their generation, lest they perish. If the feudal lords pride themselves in their nobility, they will risk toppling.

The sacred teachings descend through the ages, fundamentally for the sake of *sentient beings* [shénlíng]. Though they elevate the heavens and earth in their clarity and tranquility, their ultimate convergence rests with the feudal lords preserving the *feminine* [yīn] and applying the Dao/Way.
○ **Hé** said: The feudal lords must humble themselves to serve the people, earnestly seeking the worthy—if they were to seek only nobility above others without end, they would risk toppling and losing their position.

○ **Yún** said: *One* as *One* is nowhere absent. To speak of its principle, words cannot exhaust it—yet even in human form, when people are first born, *precision* [jīng] is their foundation. From *precision*, the spirits gather; then the body and its symbols take form. Once *precision* is lost, the form dies and the spirits depart—this too reflects the principle of *One* being undivided.

*One* is the perennial foundation of the unmanifest.

Thus, nobility must take *humility* [jiàn] as its foundation,
○ **Hé** said: If one must seek eminence, it is with *lowliness* [bòjiàn] as the foundation—like *Yǔ* [Great Sage] and *Jì* [Sage of Agriculture] toiling in the fields, *Shùn* [Emperor Shun] fashioning vessels by the riverbank, and the Duke of *Zhōu* [Zhougong] dwelling in lowly halls.

and loftiness must take *humility* as its base.
○ **Hé** said: If the feudal lords seek nobility and height, the people are not lowly—those who govern the realm must take the people as their foundation. They must labor in humility to gather them, and let their *joyous and kind* [kǎidí] transformations prevail, lest there be separation and dispersal.

○ **Yún** said: If one must seek eminence, it is with *humility* as the foundation—through building walls and performing deeds, through *lowliness* to achieve *height*, for if the base is not firm, the structure will later collapse and become perilous.

○ **Yún** said: Water, among the *Five Phases*, is the first in number, yet it flows downward without contention—this is the nature of *yin-yang*. Those who know this Dao/Way, though they occupy noble heights, do not forget their humble foundations. Thus, they are secure in their positions, just as preserving the spirits while maintaining *precision* ensures the spirits remain ever present.

Therefore, the feudal lords refer to themselves as *lonely and solitary* [gūguà], not *hub* [wú].
*One* variant reads *hub*.
○ **Hé** said: *Lonely and solitary* symbolizes *isolation*; *not hub* means they cannot function like a *wheel-hub* [wú] for all spokes to revolve around. This is how they take *humility* as their foundation.

○ **Hé** said: The feudal lords, though most noble, can refer to themselves as *lonely and solitary*—this is not taking *humility* as their foundation? To enlighten others.»

「Is it not so? *Mínghuáng* said: *Lonely and solitary* and *not hub* are what the *few* [jǐ] detest, yet the feudal lords adopt these terms as their foundation. If not so, then it is clearly taking *humility* as *lowliness* [jiàn] instead. ○ **Hé** said: These are words of sighing and lamentation.

○ **Páng** said: *One* is the least in number yet the origin of all things; hence, knowing that the foundation lies in *lowliness*, one understands that *lowliness* is true *nobility*. Therefore, they bring forth *many praises* yet are without *praise*. (The original text reads *many chariots* [shùyú wúyú], but *Bì* corrects it to *many praises* [shùyù wúyù].) ○ *Mínghuáng* said: *Number* gives, yet is without giving; the *wheel-hub* is the origin of the *spokes* [fú]. *Number* bestows nobility, yet is without nobility; *lowliness* is the foundation of *nobility*. The *original* [yuán] is the origin of the *spokes*, and one must preserve the *original* to establish the *spokes*. *Lowliness* is the foundation of *nobility*, and one must uphold *lowliness* to secure *nobility*. Thus, I urge the feudal lords to take *lowliness* as their foundation, leading to this discourse of *number* and *spokes*.

○ **Hé** said: *Politics* [zhèng], *approaching* [jiù]—when people gather around the chariot, the *spokes* become the *wheel*, the *hub*, the *axle*, and the *yoke*, yet there is no name for the chariot itself. Hence, it is called the *chariot*, illustrating how the feudal lords do not name themselves with titles of *nobility*, thus achieving their true *nobility*.

○ **Páng** said: Those who know *One* take *lowliness* as their foundation, yet internally conceal their utmost *nobility*. Thus, the world cannot truly *noble* them nor *lowly* them; if they seek *praise* [yù] for themselves and constantly bring forth *praises*, how can this be true *praise*? (The variant reads *praise* as *chariot* [yú], which is incorrect.) They do not wish to be radiant like *jade* [yù], nor rugged like *stone* [shí]. ○ *Mínghuáng* said: *Radiant* [yángyáng] refers to the appearance of *jade*; *rugged* [luòluò] refers to the appearance of *stone*.

○ **Páng** said: *Lowliness* is the greatest *virtue*. ○ **Hé** said: *Radiant* [yángyáng] symbolizes *scarcity*; *rugged* [luòluò] symbolizes *abundance*. *Jade* is scarce, hence it appears *noble*; *stone* is abundant, hence it appears *lowly*. This means they do not wish to be *noble* like *jade* nor *lowly* like *stone*—they must dwell in moderation.

○ **Bì** said: *Purity* [qīng] cannot be *purity* itself, nor *fullness* [yíng] be *fullness* itself; both have their *mothers* [mǔ] to preserve their forms. Thus, *purity* is not sufficient for *nobility*, nor *fullness* for *abundance*—*nobility* lies in its *mother*, yet the *mother* has no *noble* form. *Nobility* is rooted in *lowliness*, and *height* in *humility* as its base. Therefore, bringing forth *many praises* yet being without *praise* is the ultimate *virtue*. *Jade* and *stone*, radiant or rugged, are exhausted in their forms; hence, they are not desired.

○ **Páng** said: *Jade* and *stone* are firm in substance yet rigid in form, unable to bend or change—this is not what is meant by *One*. If all transformations arise yet remain *One*, then this is true *One*. Thus, *jade* is radiantly *noble* yet cannot be *lowly*, and *stone* is ruggedly *lowly* yet cannot be *noble*. The *Old Master* [Lǎo Shì] having clarified the meaning of *One*, fears those who do not comprehend it, so he takes *One* as unchanging, firm like *jade* and *stone*, thus losing the true principle of *One*.

Those who truly embody *One* are both *noble* and *lowly*; their *virtue/power* is like *water*, adapting to square or round, crooked or straight, responding to all things endlessly yet never departing from *One*. Thus, they cannot be truly *nobled* nor truly *lowly*—because *One* transcends *nobility* and *lowliness*. This chapter’s meaning is the most profound and difficult to express; I now roughly clarify its main points.

The *Dao/Way* generates *One*; *One* is the complete *virtue/power*, and when embodied in things, it approaches the *Dao/Way*. The previous chapter introduced the grand essence of the *Scripture on Virtue* [Déjīng], and this chapter discusses the *virtue/power* of the *Dao/Way*, just as the *Dao/Way* concludes with *small states and few people* [xiǎoguó guǎmín] and further emphasizes *trustworthy speech without adornment* [xìn yán bù měi].

**Chapter 40: The Dao/Way’s Movement Through Contrariness**
Contrariness is the movement of the *Dao/Way*. ○ *Mínghuáng* said: This clarifies *adaptation* [quán]. *Contrariness* is taken to mean *contrary to the scripture yet harmonizing with its essence*. ○ *Mínghuáng* said: *Contrariness* means *adaptation* [quán], and *adaptation* is the *Dao/Way*’s movement. When the *Dao/Way* adapts, it is the *conduct of the Sage*, and *conduct of the Sage* is the *Dao/Way*’s movement in action, hence the saying: *Contrariness is the Dao/Way’s movement*.

○ **Hé** said: *Contrariness* is the *foundation*; the *foundation* is what the *Dao/Way* uses to move. Movement generates all things; to turn away from it is to perish. ○ **Bì** said: *Height* is rooted in *humility* as its base, and *nobility* in *lowliness* as its foundation. To have *nothingness* as *use* is this *contrariness*. Movement arises from what has no form, thus all things are harmonized; hence, it is said: *Contrariness is the Dao/Way’s movement*.

○ **Páng** said: To return to the *foundation* is to attain *stillness* [jìng], and *stillness* is the capacity to move. For instance, autumn and winter can give rise to spring and summer.

**Chapter 41: The Earthly Sage Hears the Dao/Way**
*Weakness* is the *Dao/Way*’s use. ○ *Mínghuáng* said: This clarifies *reality* [shí]. *Weakness* is taken to mean *softness*, *gentleness*, and *feminine stillness*—*softness*, *gentleness*, and *feminine stillness* are how the *Sage* embodies *reality*. To embody *reality* is the *Dao/Way*’s constant use, hence the saying: *Weakness is the Dao/Way’s use*.

○ **Hé** said: *Softness* and *gentleness* are what the *Dao/Way* always employs, hence their enduring power. ○ **Bì** said: *Softness* and *gentleness* are universally effective; their limits cannot be exhausted. ○ **Páng** said: The *Dao/Way*’s use conquers all things—truly *healthy* [jiàn]. Yet *health* alone cannot sustain itself; it must take *weakness* as its foundation. This is the principle of *mutual generation*, hence the following passage returns to its origin to clarify it.

All things under the heavens are born from *having* [yǒu]. (The variant reads *all things* [wànwù].) ○ **Hé** said: All things arise from *Heaven* and *Earth*; *Heaven* and *Earth* have form and position, hence it is said they are born from *having*.

Yet *having* is born from *nothingness* [wú]. ○ *Mínghuáng* said: When *reality* [shí] is applied to *adaptation* [quán], it comes from *nothingness* generating *having*, hence those who practice *adaptation* must reverse to *reality*, and those who use *having* must rely on *nothingness*. Yet the supreme *Dao/Way* is empty and tranquil, detached from names; all *dharma* is inherently *void* [kōng], not depending on each other. If one can forget both *adaptation* and *reality*, and efface both *having* and *nothingness*, then *many chariots without chariots* [shùyú wúyú] can be said to transcend.

○ **Hé** said: *Heaven* and *Earth*’s spirits are divine and luminous; insects fly and worms wriggle—all arise from the *Dao/Way*. The *Dao/Way* has no form, hence it is said they are born from *nothingness*. This means the *origin* surpasses the *ornate*, the *weak* surpasses the *strong*, and *humility* surpasses *fullness*.

○ **Bì** said: All things under the heavens are born from *having*, yet the beginning of *having* is *nothingness*. To preserve *having* completely, one must return to *nothingness*.

○ **Páng** said: *Nothingness* generates *having*, and *having* returns to *nothingness*—they generate each other cyclically, and all things thus align in *One*.

The *Earthly Sage* [tǔshì] hears the *Dao/Way*.」

The **Superior Sage** hears the *Dao/Way* and diligently practices it.

○ **Emperor Minghuang** said: *Enlightenment* moves one to action.

○ **Hé** said: The **Superior Sage**, upon hearing the *Dao/Way*, acts of his own accord, striving with all his might.

○ **Bì** said: This is *resolve*.

○ **Páng** said: A **Sage** is a *learner*, so he values *resolve*. Without *resolve*, one can never speak of the *Dao/Way*.

The **Middle Sage** hears the *Dao/Way* as if it exists, as if it does not.

○ **Emperor Minghuang** said: The **Middle Sage** may ascend or descend, hence his doubt. Doubt makes him waver between existence and nonexistence.

○ **Hé** said: The **Middle Sage** must hear the *Dao/Way*, cultivating his person to prolong life, governing his state though it is not yet pacified, cherishing it with joy—yet when confronted with wealth, desire, honor, or passion, he loses it again.

○ **Páng** said: This is the man who hears the Master’s *Dao/Way* and takes delight in it.

The **Lesser Sage** hears the *Dao/Way* and laughs at it.

○ **Emperor Minghuang** said: The **Lesser Sage** is confused and disbelieving, hence his laughter.

○ **Hé** said: The **Lesser Sage** is greedy, cruel, and filled with desires. Seeing the *Dao/Way* as weak, he fears it; seeing it as plain, he deems it vulgar—thus he laughs at it.

○ **Páng** said: The *Dao/Way* is vast yet seems unworthy; shallow men do not recognize it, hence they laugh. Truly, as the following text says, can the common folk truly perceive it?

Not to be laughed at is not enough to be the *Dao/Way*.

○ **Emperor Minghuang** said: If the *Dao/Way* is not laughed at by the **Lesser Sage**, it is not profound enough to be the supreme *Dao/Way*.

○ **Hé** said: If the *Dao/Way* is not laughed at by the **Lesser Sage**, it cannot be called the *Dao/Way*.

○ **Páng** said: A solitary form, presented to the world’s eyes—is that truly the *Dao/Way*? Hence the saying was established.

○ **Emperor Minghuang** said: *Jiàn* means *to establish*.

○ **Hé** said: *Jiàn* means *to set forth*. The following sentences establish how one with the *Dao/Way* should be.

○ **Bì** said: *Jiàn* comes from *establishing*.

○ **Hé** said: Those who illuminate the *Dao/Way* seem obscured.

○ **Bì** said: Bright yet not dazzling.

○ **Páng** said: Great clarity seems dim; to discern good and evil with sharpness is not to understand the *Dao/Way*.

The *Dao/Way* in simplicity seems ordinary.

○ **Emperor Minghuang** said: The **Superior Sage** acts yet seems inactive, in advancement seems retreat, in simplicity seems common—thus the **Middle Sage** doubts and the **Lesser Sage** laughs.

○ **Hé** said: *Yí* means *plain*. Those who embody the Great *Dao/Way* do not distinguish themselves, like the many trembling leaves.

○ **Bì** said: *Lèi* means *to assimilate*. The Great *Dao/Way* follows the nature of things, not forcing them—its plainness is unseen, yet it returns again, as if assimilating.

○ **Páng** said: *Zhuangzi* says: *"To level the uneven is to level."*

The *Dao/Way* in advancement seems retreat.

○ **Hé** said: Those who pursue the *Dao/Way* seem to lag behind.

○ **Bì** said: To place oneself behind yet lead, to set oneself aside yet preserve—

○ **Yú** said: *Mencius* says: *"The swift in advance are swift in retreat."* Thus, in pursuing the *Dao/Way*, one must follow the times and align with principle, nurturing it straightly—one must not rush for results, hence it seems retreat.

This is unlike the man who uproots seedlings.

**Superior virtue** is like a valley.

The **Emperor Minghuang** said: *To be empty and receptive, containing all things.*

○ **Hé** said: The person of **superior virtue** is like a deep valley—
they do not shame themselves for filth and turbidity.

○ **Bì** said: Not claiming one’s own virtue,
there is nothing to hoard.

○ **Yú** said: **Superior virtue** does not claim virtue,
yet its efficacy is inexhaustible—
like a valley, empty yet responsive.

**Great whiteness is like humiliation.**
The **Emperor Minghuang** said: *Pure yet containing impurity.*

○ **Hé** said: The truly white, if stained with humiliation,
does not flaunt itself.

○ **Bì** said: Knowing its whiteness,
yet guarding its blackness—
only then does great whiteness emerge.

○ **Yú** said: Knowing its whiteness,
yet guarding its blackness—
*Confucius* said: *"Dyed yet not stained,
dyed yet seeming humiliated."*

**Broad virtue seems insufficient.**
The **Emperor Minghuang** said: *Greatly accomplished yet practicing humility.*

○ **Hé** said: The person of vast virtue,
seems dull and lacking.

○ **Bì** said: Broad virtue is never full—
vast and formless, never satisfied.

○ **Yú** said: The clod-like, the overabundant—
how could they be broad in virtue?

**Establishing virtue seems lazy.**
The **Emperor Minghuang** said: *Fulfilling deeds yet not boasting.*

○ **Hé** said: Those who establish virtue,
seem to slacken, making themselves empty.

○ **Bì** said: *Lazy*—matching.
Establishing virtue follows things naturally,
neither forcing nor applying—
thus it seems lazy, unhurried.

○ **Yú** said: *Lazy*—temporizing.
Hasty desires for speed,
striving to achieve something—
how could this be virtue?
Only by following the times and aligning with principle,
as if lazy and sluggish,
can one achieve the great.

*Zhuangzi* says: *"Only when unavoidable does one act."*

**True substance seems lazy.**
The **Emperor Minghuang** said: *Simple and harmonious, blending light.*

○ **Hé** said: The unadorned person,
seems like colors faded, unclear.

○ **Bì** said: The truly simple
does not boast its simplicity—
thus it fades.

○ **Yú** said: Embracing nature, nurturing spirit,
moving among the world’s concerns—
in a thousand transformations, conforming to customs,
yet its truth remains constant.
Thus, none perceive its truth.
That old man of Han Yin,
fastidious in his truth,
separating himself from the world,
startled even Confucius’ disciples,
while the Sage deemed him a false modifier of Hun Dun—
was this not what is meant by *true substance*?

**The great square has no corners.**
The **Emperor Minghuang** said: *No petty angles established.*

○ **Hé** said: The person of great rectitude,
has no arbitrary curves or edges.

○ **Bì** said: Square yet not partitioned—
thus no corners.

○ **Yú** said: The great square is the body of the *Dao*.
If it has four corners,
its form is exhausted by what is seen—
its smallness is long past.

**Great vessels take long to mature.**
The **Emperor Minghuang** said: *Do not seek swift results.*

○ **Hé** said: The person of great capacity,
like the nine tripods or coral reefs,
cannot be hastily completed.

○ **Bì** said: Great vessels complete the world,
not clinging to partial achievements—
thus they mature late.

○ **Yú** said: The achievements of emperors
are not as swift as those of kings.

**Great sound is rare in voice.**
The **Emperor Minghuang** said: *No adornment in trifles.*

○ **Hé** said: Great sound is like thunder—
waiting for the moment to act,
illustrating the love of *qi* and rare speech.

○ **Bì** said: *Hearing yet not hearing*—rare sound,
a sound that cannot be heard.

If there is sound, there is division;
if there is division, it is no longer *official* and *commercial*—
it cannot govern the masses.
Thus, those with sound are not great sound.

○ **Yú** said: The *Dao* is full yet without boundary,
its essence ever still—
things cannot disturb it,
its sound is always sound, yet the world cannot hear it.

*Zhuangzi* says: *"In the silence, only harmony is heard."*
This is what is meant by *rare sound*.

**Great form is shapeless.**
The **Emperor Minghuang** said: *Thus it can respond to all kinds.*

○ **Hé** said: The person of great law and form,
unadorned, without appearance.

○ **Bì** said: If there is form, there is division—
those with division are neither too hot nor too cold,
yet if they have form, they are not great form.

○ **Yú** said: It can bestow form upon all things,
yet its essence is ever vast, unable to be possessed—
this is the complete body of the *Dao*.
Because it has things, it is called *great form*.

**The *Dao* is hidden, nameless.**
The **Emperor Minghuang** said: *Its functions are not displayed—
an unnamed master.*

○ **Hé** said: The *Dao* is concealed,
making people unable to name it.

○ **Páng** said: From *rare sound* downward,
all are the complete *Dao*,
yet their paths differ—
thus it is called *great sound*, *great form*.

If one embodies *great sound* and *great form* as the *Dao*,
then one’s *Dao* is complete.

Only when the *Dao* is complete
does thought fail to reach it.

In being, it is substance;
in non-being, it is emptiness—
everywhere thus,
nowhere absent—
yet to name it is impossible to describe.
Within the nameless, this thing is always present,
desired yet unseen—
thus it is called *hidden*.

Only the *Dao* is good at lending and completing.
The **Emperor Minghuang** said: *Though hidden and nameless,
it is truly good—
with boundless harmony and wondrous efficacy,
lending *qi* to all things and bringing them to fulfillment.*

○ **Hé** said: *Complete*—to fulfill.

Speaking of the *Dao*’s goodness in bestowing *qi*
and completing things.

○ **Bì** said: All these virtues
are the *Dao*’s achievements—
in form, it is *great form* yet shapeless;
in sound, it is *great sound* yet rare in voice.
Things are completed by it yet see no form—
thus it is hidden and nameless.

Its lending is not merely to supply deficiencies—
a single lending suffices to perpetuate virtue forever—
thus it is *good at lending*.

Its completing does not rely on craftsmanship’s cutting—
no thing it does not aid in forming—
thus it is *good at completing*.

○ **Páng** said: The *Dao* can supply all things’ needs and complete them,
yet what things receive returns to its source—
though the *Dao* abundantly sustains all things,
I have never been depleted.

「**Lending**—this is the act of responding to another’s deficiency and yet ultimately seeing it returned.

I have privately reflected on this passage: The *Dao* is not distant from people, yet the world cannot perceive it—this is because it is not illuminated. Hence, I begin with *Illuminating the Dao*. The *Great Dao* is most plain, yet only the enlightened can follow it to progress. Therefore, I next speak of *Following the Plain Dao* and *Advancing along the Dao*.

To advance along the *Dao* and return to the constant of *nature and life*, this is the *virtue without virtue*—thus, I next speak of *Establishing Virtue as the Humble*.

The *virtue of the Humble* is self-sustaining yet does not align with the common masses—thus, it is unstained and pure, for its whiteness inherently distinguishes it from things. How then could it be as tranquil as a valley? Hence, I next speak of *Establishing Virtue as the Unadorned*.

To be unadorned and yet pure is the narrowness of *Boyi*—how then could it be broad? Thus, I speak of *Establishing Virtue as the Humble* only after *Establishing Virtue as the Unadorned*.

The *virtue of the Humble* that can be broadened is the virtue of one who walks with the people yet can serve as a ruler and teacher—thus, I say *Establishing Virtue as the Unassuming*.

The *Unassuming* does not eagerly seek to establish anything—*establishing virtue* means setting up a foundation, yet this risks straying from the true and approaching falsity. Therefore, it is essential to preserve my genuine nature, and thus I next speak of *Maintaining True Nature*.

With this progression, the *Dao* within me is now fully embodied—thus, I say *The Great Square has no corners*.

Having the *Great Square* as its foundation, one can then respond to the transmission of the *Dao* without bounds and thus weave the remaining threads for humanity—hence, I say *The Great Vessel*.

The *Great Vessel* is one’s *achievement*—the *Perfect Person* uses even the husks of grain, straw, and soil as vessels, yet the vessel is never small. Confucius called *Guan Zhong* a *small vessel*—then the *achievements of an emperor and king* are indeed the *Great Vessel*.

Though the *Dao* accomplishes these things, its ultimate purpose is not to dwell on them—it is never doing, never possessing—thus, I say *The Great Sound* and *The Great Form*. Hence, it is fully exhausted, yet it can align with the *Dao* as one and supply all things’ needs, completing their *nature*.

Ah! This *Dao*, one cannot recognize it with mere recognition—how much less can one describe it with words! Yet my discourse on it is but crude.

**Chapter 42: The Dao Gives Rise to Oneness**
The *Dao* gives rise to *Oneness*—**He** said: The *Dao*’s initial generation is *Oneness*.
*Oneness* gives rise to *Twoness*—**He** said: *Oneness* generates *Yin* and *Yang*.
*Twoness* gives rise to *Threeness*—**Emperor Minghuang** said: *Oneness* is the *Pungent Qi*—speaking of how the *Dao* moves to emit the *Pungent, Harmonious, and Marvelous Qi* into the principle of generating things, yet this alone is insufficient, so it further generates *Yang Qi*. *Yang Qi* cannot generate alone, so it further generates *Yin Qi*. The accumulation of *Pungent Qi* as *Oneness* is why it is said *Oneness* gives rise to *Twoness*. The accumulation of *Yang Qi* as *Twoness* is why it is said *Twoness* gives rise to *Threeness*.
**He** said: *Yin* and *Yang* generate the *Harmonious Qi*, and the three *Qi*—*Harmonious, Clear, and Turbid*—distinguish into *Heaven, Earth,* and *Human*.
*Threeness* gives rise to *all things*—**Emperor Minghuang** said: *Yin* and *Yang* contain and nurture, the *Pungent Qi* harmonizes and adjusts, and thus all things flourish and complete—hence, it is said *Threeness* gives rise to *all things*.
**He** said: *Heaven* and *Earth* together generate all things—*Heaven* bestows, *Earth* transforms, and *Human* nurtures them.
**Pang** said: The *Dao* encompasses *Yin* and *Yang*—it has *Yin*, it has *Yang*, and it has the *balance between Yin and Yang*. These three things are the beginning of the numbers *One, Two,* and *Three*, and all things’ kinds emerge and enter through them. Hence, their essence and form are most minute and exhaustive, and examining their patterns and symbols all conform to this. Knowing this is to know the origin of all things—knowing their origin, what remains of their end?

The *Perfect Person*’s use rests in the present yet knows the ten thousand ages thereafter—perhaps it lies here.

All things bear *Yin* yet embrace *Yang*—**He** said: All things without exception bear *Yin* yet turn toward *Yang*, revolving inward to return to the *Sun* and the *Pungent Qi* as harmony.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: All things obtain *Yin, Yang,* and *Pungent Qi* to generate and complete—hence, they bear and embrace *Yin* and *Yang*, containing and nourishing the *Pungent Qi* as gentle and harmonious.
**He** said: Within all things lies the *Original Qi*—obtaining it brings harmony and gentleness, like the *breasts having their store* and *bones their marrow*, or how *plants and trees have hollow spaces* and *paths for Qi* to flow, thus they can endure long life.
**Pang** said: Through this, they generate—thus, there is nothing that does not bear and embrace. Observing my form reveals its principle.

When *Yin* and *Yang* are balanced in moderation, harmony arises. All this illustrates how all things are governed by *Yin* and *Yang*—bound by numbers, they must correspond to their waxing and waning.

What people detest is *loneliness, widowhood,* and *not being filled*—yet rulers and nobles take these as their titles.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: All things take the *Pungent, Harmonious Qi* as their foundation, and the *Pungent Qi* that is harmonious, gentle, and guards the foundation must be humble and weak. Hence, though rulers and nobles are most exalted, they take *loneliness, widowhood,* and *not being filled* as their titles—this is because humility and gentleness are their foundation.
**He** said: *Loneliness, widowhood,* and *not being filled* are names of *non-divinity*, yet rulers and nobles take them as titles—this is to dwell in humility, following the law of *emptiness, spaciousness,* and gentle harmony.
**Pang** said: When *Yin* reaches its extreme, it generates *Yang*; when *Yang* reaches its extreme, it generates *Yin*—this is the nature of *Yin* and *Yang*.
Thus, the high becomes low, and the low becomes full. Though *lords and kings* occupy the most exalted positions, their power is most perilous—hence, they take what people detest as their own names, to adapt to the harmony of *Yin* and *Yang*—thus, the following passage states:

Hence, things may be diminished yet benefit, or benefited yet diminished.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: When one diminishes oneself, others benefit. When one benefits oneself, others are diminished. Thus, those who *return to the root* are good at descending, the humble and weak hold the power of life, and the titles of *loneliness, widowhood,* and *not being filled* are not inappropriate.

**He** said: To increase one’s height leads to collapse; to covet wealth invites calamity.
**Bi** said: All things take myriad forms, yet their return is to *Oneness*—how does one achieve *Oneness*? Through *non-being*.

From *non-being* comes *Oneness*—*Oneness* can be called *non-being*, yet *non-being* is already called *Oneness*—how can one avoid speaking of it?
If there is speech, there is *Oneness*—how is this not *Twoness*?
If there is *Oneness* and *Twoness*, then *Threeness* arises—following the *Oneness* of *non-being*, the numbers are exhausted here.

Beyond this point lies not the flow of the Dao.
Thus, though myriad things arise, I know their master:
Though forms may differ, their essence is one—*qi* undivided.

The common folk possess hearts,
Diverse lands, distinct customs,
Yet those who grasp *Oneness* rule as kings and lords.

To take *Oneness* as master—how can one command it?
The more one seeks, the farther one strays;
To diminish is to draw near.
When diminished to exhaustion, one attains its utmost.

Though called *Oneness*, it still reaches *Threeness*—
How much more so when its origin is not *Oneness*?
Yet to diminish and gain—is this not true speech?

**Yun** said:
Moisture nourishes the lowlands, mountains grow barren.
At noon, the sun’s arc reverses;
Deficit yields to fullness—
All things follow *yin-yang* cycles.
Numbers arise from *Oneness* and *Twoness*;
At their limit, they invert—
Thus all things conform.
The perfected one adapts to fullness and emptiness,
Follows the rhythms of ebb and flow,
Ever maintaining humility and openness in self-cultivation—
How could one forcefully resist and invite ruin?

What people are taught—
**He** said:
Common teaching urges the weak to become strong,
The yielding to become rigid.

Yet this is my teaching’s intent.
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
Laozi taught:
When rulers establish teachings to instruct others,
They should use the principle of *brimming* as *gently weak*—
Not empty words.

**He** said:
My teaching to the masses is to discard strength for weakness,
Rigidity for yielding.

**Bi** said:
My non-strength makes others follow it.
Using natural spontaneity, upholding ultimate principle—
To conform brings fortune, to defy brings calamity.
Thus, when people teach, defiance invites self-inflicted ruin.
Yet my teaching to others—do not defy it.

The overbearing perish without proper death—
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
The overbearing clash with all things;
Seeking gain, they lose—
Things strike them down, so they die untimely.

**He** said:
The overbearing are those who reject the Mysterious and Virtuous,
Betray the Dao, disregard teachings, and rely on power.
To die untimely means to be cut off by Heaven,
Slain by weapons, executed by law—
Not dying by natural lifespan.

I shall make this my foundational teaching.
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
I have seen the overbearing perish, the yielding survive—
Thus, I establish this teaching of gentle weakness as the parent of all teachings.

**He** said:
*Parent* means origin.
Laozi begins with the overbearing as a warning.

**Bi** said:
The overbearing will not die properly—
If one teaches others to be overbearing, they should not be.
To cite their untimely deaths as teaching is fortunate—
Those who follow my teaching will prosper.
Thus, those who defy it are best suited to serve as its warning.

**Yu** said:
To discern *yin-yang*’s nature reveals that all things have principle—
All can be models.
The overbearing meet ruin—
The utmost evil—
Yet those who grasp principle see it as a mirror for *ebbing and flowing*,
Making it the parent of teaching—is this not fitting?

**Chapter 43: The Ultimate Softness of the World**
The world’s ultimate softness
Overcomes the world’s ultimate hardness.

**Emperor Minghuang** said:
The world’s ultimate softness is true nature.
If one gallops through worldly affairs,
Stained by dusty realms,
Desires overwhelming—
Then one becomes the world’s ultimate hardness.

**He** said:
The ultimate softness is water;
The ultimate hardness is metal and stone.
Water penetrates hardness, enters rigidity—
Nothing it cannot pass through.

**Bi** said:
*Qi* enters everywhere;
Water flows everywhere.

**Yu** said:
The Sage governs all rigidity through softness—
Observed in water.

Without gaps—
**He** said:
*Without gaps* refers to the Dao—
Formless, boundless,
Entering and exiting without obstruction,
Communing with all life.

**Xiu** said:
If even the finest things obstruct,
How could one enter the gapless?

Observed in phenomena, it is the utmost emptiness—
Thus the Sage embodies the formless yet responds to all forms.

Hence, one knows the benefits of *wuwei*.

**Emperor Minghuang** said:
*Without gaps* means the heart is unstained by worldly dust,
Empty of all attachments.
*Gapless* refers to the Dao’s pure stillness,
Its wondrous, unified body—
No fissures exist.
If one is not disturbed by desires,
Heart and realm both still,
Empty of all attachments—
Then heart and Dao merge, entering the gapless.

Thus the Sage says:
*I see that a tranquil mind and body can unite with the Dao—*
Knowing that active teachings are not as beneficial as *wuwei*.

**He** said:
I see the Dao’s *wuwei* yet all things spontaneously transform—
Thus I know *wuwei* benefits humanity.

**Bi** said:
Empty, soft, weak—
Nothing it cannot penetrate,
Nothing it cannot exhaust.
The utmost softness cannot be bent—
Extending this, I know *wuwei*’s benefits.

**Chapter 44: Names and the Self**
Which is closer—name or self?
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
Names are guests of reality.
Those who sacrifice themselves for names perish—
Asking who is closer urges one to abandon fame and function,
Preserving the true self.

**He** said:
Names advance, the self retreats.

**Bi** said:
To prize fame and seek loftiness—
His body grows frail and sparse.
Which is more abundant—body or wealth?
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
Those who sacrifice themselves for fame seek wealth,
Yet gain wealth only to lose their bodies.
Asking which is more abundant urges one to discard jade and shatter pearls,
Preserving their harmony.

**He** said:
Wealth in excess harms the body.

**Bi** said:
Greed for wealth is insatiable—
Yet the body grows ever fewer.

**Mou** said:
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"Distinguish the boundaries of inner and outer,
Discern the realms of honor and disgrace—*
I have spoken before:
Though true and false may not intermingle,
Though noble and base stand far apart,
Yet they constantly shift in weight—
One must be ever vigilant.

Those who lose their nature
Forget their boundless possession,
Yet chase external things,
Hoarding endlessly, proud of their gains—
They think themselves fortunate,
Yet what they take is dust and filth, rot and stench,
Things not meant to be kept.
What they consume and lose is what defines *them*—
Their reckoning of closeness and distance, abundance and scarcity,
Is already foolish beyond measure—
How can one not pity them?

Only those who depend on nothing external
And attend solely to the inner
Can speak of the Dao.
Thus, Yanzi’s virtue earned Confucius’ praise
For his joy in the humble fare of the narrow lane—
Then the cultivation of the gentleman is clear.

Today’s scholars lack not for cleverness,
Yet their wills serve the external.
The external grows heavy, the inner light—
Their innate nature, once bright in liver and diaphragm,
Now lies beneath the surface of face and eyes,
Far from its root.
Yet they still seek to discuss the deepest truths of antiquity—
Their labor yields no fruit.

Observe Laozi’s words:
They seem meaningless at first glance,
Yet they are the scholar’s ultimate warning,
The essential task of self-cultivation.
Thus I expand their meaning and elaborate.

Which is the greater affliction—gain or loss?
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
Asking whether gaining fame and wealth
Or losing fame and wealth
Is the greater affliction to the body.

**He** said:
Love of profit brings corruption in conduct.

**Bi** said:
To gain much wealth yet lose one’s body—
Which is the greater affliction?

**Mou** said:
Gain brings possession,
Yet possession always lacks sufficiency.
Possession wearies the spirit and drains the essence in guarding it—
Its affliction is great indeed.

Thus, excessive love brings great expenditure.
**He** said:
Excessive love of beauty exhausts the spirit,
Excessive love of wealth invites calamity.
The loved is little, the lost is much—
Hence, it is called great expenditure.

Hoarding much brings heavy loss.
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
Excessive love of fame exhausts the spirit—
Is this not great expenditure?
Excessive wealth burdens the body—
Is this not heavy loss?

**Bi** said:
Excessive love cuts itself off from others,
Hoarding much refuses to disperse.
Many seek it, many attack it—
It is afflicted by external forces,
Thus great expenditure and heavy loss.

**Mou** said:
This is the most profound truth,
Yet the world remains unaware.

Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace.
**He** said:
Those who know sufficiency
Are content with what they have, free of desire—
Their bodies suffer no disgrace.

**Mou** said:
What is noble lies within—
How could there be disgrace?

Knowing when to stop brings no peril.
**He** said:
Knowing when to halt,
Wealth and profit do not burden the body,
Sounds and colors do not confuse the senses—
Thus the body faces no peril.

**Mou** said:
Seeking nothing from without,
One remains ever at ease.

This can endure long.
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
Those who know sufficiency do not love excessively.
Those who know when to stop do not hoard excessively.
Since there is no disgrace or peril,
It can endure long.

**He** said:
If people know when to stop and suffice,
Fortune and blessings lie within themselves.
Those who cultivate the self exhaust not their spirits,
Those who govern the state disturb not their people—
Thus it can endure long.

**Chapter 45: The Great Fullness as if Deficient**

The great fullness as if deficient—
**He** said:
This refers to a sovereign of supreme **Dao** and **virtue**,
As if deficient—
He extinguishes fame and reputation,
Like the destruction of a broken vessel.
His use does not wear out.
**He** said:
If his governance is as such,
Then there will never be a time when it is exhausted.

**Mou** said:
When learning and practice reach great fullness,
They are always as if stained and incomplete—
Humility brings benefit,
So his governance never faces exhaustion or failure.

**Wang Rú** said:
This is true great fullness—
A lesser fullness stands alone as a complete entity,
And thus fails to attain the **Dao**.
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"Fame achieved brings loss."*

The great overflow as if emptied—
**He** said:
This refers to a sovereign of supreme **Dao** and **virtue**,
Overflowing with blessings.
He who is noble does not dare to be arrogant,
He who is rich does not dare to be extravagant.
His use does not run dry.
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
When blessings and rank are full,
They are always as if emptied and void—
Frugality does not harm wealth,
So his use never lacks.

**He** said:
If his governance is as such,
Then there will never be a time when it is exhausted.

**Wang Rú** said:
Great fullness is complete and abundant,
Yet it follows things and gives without favor,
So it seems as if emptied.

**Wang Yú** said:
Fullness leads to depletion—
How can there be endless use without exhaustion?

The great upright as if bent—
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
Upright yet not rigid,
So it seems as if bent.

**He** said:
Great uprightness refers to the rectitude of **Dao** and **virtue**,
Unchanging as one.
As if bent—
He does not contend with the vulgar,
Like something that can be bent and folded.

**Wang Rú** said:
Following things to be upright,
Uprightness does not lie in rigidity alone,
So it seems as if bent.

**Wang Xiù** said:
For those upright in principle,
Flexibility meets the changes,
Not clinging to their own rigidity,
So none see their uprightness.

The great skill as if clumsy—
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
Skill does not stray beyond its proper bounds,
So it seems as if clumsy.

**He** said:
Great skill refers to manifold talents,
Yet he does not dare to flaunt his abilities.

**Wang Rú** said:
Great skill arises from nature’s completion,
Not contrived as an eccentric deviation,
So it seems as if clumsy.

**Wang Yú** said:
Transmitting things to their natural fulfillment,
Then externally there is no artificial skill,
Yet true skill is attained—
Those who carve and shape all forms
Do not verify this.

The great eloquence as if tongue-tied—
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
Not embellishing trivial tales,
So it seems as if tongue-tied.

**He** said:
Great eloquence is wisdom without doubt.
As if tongue-tied—
His words are without artifice.

**Wang Rú** said:
Great eloquence follows things in speech,
Creating nothing of his own,
So it seems as if tongue-tied.

**Wang Yú** said:
Skillfully explaining all things,
This is the source of eloquence’s name—
But the highest truth is not verbose,
So it seems as if tongue-tied.

**Agitation overcomes cold**—
**He** said:
*Overcomes*—the extreme.

「Spring and summer, the **Yang qi** is agitated and swift above, all things flourish and reach their peak—
At the extreme, there is cold, and cold brings decay and death.
Thus, one should not be overly rigid and agitated.

**Staticness overcomes heat**—
**He** said:
In autumn and winter, all things rest beneath the Yellow Springs,
At the extreme, there is heat, and heat is the source of life.

**Clarity and stillness** are the **Dao/Way** of the world’s rectitude.
**Emperor Minghuang** said:
When agitation overcomes, there is cold—cold, thinness.
When staticness overcomes, there is heat—heat, harmony.
Thus, if one bends, it is the greatest straightness;
The clear and still is the rectitude of the world.

**He** said:
If one can maintain clarity and stillness,
They will endure as the world’s **long** (eternal).
To uphold rectitude is to have no end of days.

**Wang Rú** said:
Agitation, then, can overcome cold,
Stillness without action overcomes heat—
By this reasoning, clarity and stillness are the world’s rectitude.

Stillness preserves the **true nature** of all things,
Agitation offends the **nature** of all things—
Thus, only clarity and stillness can attain the above greatness.

**Wang Yú** said:
Agitation overcomes with superficiality,
Stillness overcomes with essence—
To overcome with essence is to attain the above greatness,
To overcome with superficiality is to make all movement small.
Thus, it is known that clarity and stillness are the utmost rectitude.

**Chapter Forty-Six: "The World in Harmony"**
When the **Dao/Way** prevails in the world...」

**Chapter Forty-Six: "The World in Harmony"**
*(continued)*

**Chapter Forty-Seven: "Not Leaving the Door"**

Not leaving the door,
One knows the world.

**He** said:
The **Sage** knows the world without leaving the door by understanding one’s own body to know others’ bodies, one’s own household to know others’ households—thus perceiving the world.

Not peering through a window,
One sees the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.

**Ming Huang** said:
With **non-action** and **spontaneous transformation** prevailing, no decrees are issued beyond the door. This is knowing the **principle** of governing the world—when human affairs are in harmony, the celestial patterns follow suit, so one need not laboriously peer through windows to know the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.

**He** said:
The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and the **Dao/Way** of humanity are the same; Heaven and humanity are interconnected, their **vital essence and qi** flowing through each other. If the ruler is **clear and still**, the Heavenly **qi** will naturally align. If the ruler is **excessively desirous**, the Heavenly **qi** will grow troubled and chaotic, and all matters of **auspiciousness, inauspiciousness, benefit, and harm** arise from within oneself.

**Wang Rú** said:
All things have their **root**, and all affairs have their **master**—though their paths differ, their destination is the same; though their concerns vary, their essence converges. The **Dao/Way** has its **great constancy**, and **principle** has its **great governance**—if one holds to the ancient **Dao/Way**, one can guide the present. Even when dwelling in the present, one can discern the origins of antiquity, hence the saying: "Not leaving the door nor peering through windows, yet one can know."

**Wang Yú** said:
The myriad affairs of the world and the subtle **Dao/Way** of Heaven all share the same **root in human nature**. The ultimate refinement of this **root** is to **fulfill one’s true nature**—closing the eyes and ears yet perceiving all things. If one merely sees and then recognizes, then recognizes and then knows, this is grasping the myriad distinct forms while obscuring the singular **principle** of **governance**. Thus, what they call "recognition and knowledge" is merely the superficial use of ears and eyes, not the profound essence of the heart’s **expansion**. They claim to be **comprehensive**, yet they know nothing of their utter **paucity**; they claim to be **wise**, yet they know nothing of their extreme **foolishness**. The farther they go, the less they know.

**Ming Huang** said:
If one cannot **abide in non-action**, even if one issues decrees far and wide, one’s understanding of the **principle** of governing the world will only grow shallower.

**He** said:
It means departing from one’s own household to observe others’ households, abandoning one’s own body to observe others’ bodies—the farther one looks, the less one truly sees.

**Wang Rú** said:
**Non-action** lies in **unity**, yet one seeks it among the myriad—**Dao/Way** is invisible when gazed upon, inaudible when listened to, unattainable when grasped. If one truly knows it, there is no need to leave the door. If one does not know it, the farther one goes, the more lost one becomes.

**Wang Yú** said:
The **principle** of the **Ultimate** is fully realized in a single speck of dust—no trifling thoughts arise, and all myriad **affiliations** manifest. The **key** to learning the **Dao/Way** lies here. Yet they seek it far afield—this is already to have lost the way. The farther they go, the less they know—is this not so?

Hence, the **Sage** knows without action,
**Ming Huang** said:
Not leaving the door, hence the saying "without action"—**spontaneous transformation** in **purity and simplicity**, and knowing is the **principle** of **governance**.

**He** said:
The **Sage** neither ascends to Heaven nor descends to the depths, yet knows Heaven and Earth through the heart’s **perception**.

Not seeing yet naming,
**Ming Huang** said:
Not peering through windows, hence the saying "not seeing"—when humanity is in harmony and Heaven follows, one can rightly name the era as **"Great Peace"**.

**He** said:
When the ruler **upholds virtue/power**, the people **love virtue/power**; when the ruler **loves martial ways**, the people **love strength**. The **Sage** discerns the **small** to grasp the **great**, examines the **inner** to know the **outer**.

**Wang Rú** said:
Having attained the **essence** of all things, even if the **Sage** does not act, the **principle** can still be discerned. Having grasped the **root** of all things, even if the **Sage** does not see, the **logic** of right and wrong can be understood and named.

**○ Pan said:**
Those who exhaust principle and grasp the root suffice for this. But for those who embody the boundless and exhaust all extremes—when they gaze upon the four horizons, their insight pierces without obstruction, and the myriad transformations, though diverse, never stray from before their eyes—this is truly wondrous. What need is there to speak of it?

**Non-action yet completion.**
**Ming Huang said:**
Without spoken teaching, the world transforms itself.

**○ He said:**
When the ruler does nothing, the people have no burdens; when households are ample and people are content, all things naturally transform and align.

**○ Bi said:**
Clarifying the nature of things and following it—thus, even without action, completion is achieved.

**○ Pan said:**
What does Heaven speak? The four seasons proceed therein, and all things are born therein. Those who embody the Dao are but Heaven itself.

---
**Chapter 48: Daily Increase in Learning**

**Daily increase in learning.**
**He said:**
Learning refers to the study of governance, rites, music, and education. Daily increase means that desires and adornments grow ever more refined.

**○ Bi said:**
Strive to advance what one is capable of and refine what one practices.

**○ Xiu said:**
When one exhausts principle, one examines all things and unites them, seeking only one’s true essence—not for mere breadth. Thus, daily increase brings no harm, but when principle is exhausted, further increase becomes a detriment, and one must turn to subtraction as benefit.

**Daily subtraction in the Dao.**
**Ming Huang said:**
The scholar daily increases knowledge.
The practitioner of the Dao daily subtracts deeds.

Increasing knowledge is the gradual path of study; subtracting deeds is the gateway to enlightenment. Thus, one accumulates deeds through increase, yet forgets deeds to embody the Dao.

**○ He said:**
The Dao refers to the natural Way; daily subtraction means that desires and adornments are daily diminished.

**○ Bi said:**
Strive to return to emptiness and nothingness.

**○ Pan said:**
After perceiving principle, one recognizes the faults in all things—subtraction is not willed, yet all accretions gradually fade. Observing Heaven’s Way, increase and subtraction generate each other, a constant truth of all things.

**Subtract again and again.**
**He said:**
Subtract desires again and again, thus gradually removing them.

**○ Pan said:**
When one reaches utter emptiness, even emptiness is not a thing—then the extent of subtraction is known.

**Until non-action.**
**He said:**
Be serene and simple as an infant, doing nothing contrived.

**Non-action yet nothing remains undone.**
**Ming Huang said:**
The scholar accumulates deeds; the practitioner of the Dao forgets subtraction. Though deeds are subtracted, the desire to subtract remains—when even this desire is forgotten, one attains tranquil non-action. Like a mirror reflecting all things without fail, thus nothing remains undone.

**○ He said:**
When desires are severed, virtue aligns with the Dao, and nothing is beyond its application or beyond its doing.

**○ Bi said:**
Action entails loss; thus, non-action is the way of nothing remaining undone.

**○ Pan said:**
Only those who exhaust emptiness and voidness can nurture and unleash the myriad transformations endlessly. How could they compare to those of one-sided pursuit, stagnant in seclusion, like withered trees?

Thus, those who take the world must always act with non-interference.
**Ming Huang said:**
Non-action and non-interference—then the world turns with devotion. Governing the world must always be with non-interference, not with toil.

**○ Bi said:**
Action must always follow its natural course.

**○ Pan said:**
Non-interference is the true essence of the Sage. When responding to the times, the Dao is diminished.

Thus, though the Sage may seem close to action, what makes them sage and able to subdue the world lies always in non-interference. When they act,
**Bi said:**
It is self-created.

**It is insufficient to take the world.**
**Ming Huang said:**
Action brings toil; toil brings decay—thus it is insufficient to take the world.

**○ He said:**
When one delights in action, governance becomes burdensome, and the people are unsettled—thus it is insufficient to rule the world.

**○ Bi said:**
This is losing the fundamental root.

**○ Xiu said:**
Action entails intention; intention means the people also have intentions—though one seeks to govern, they will be distant indeed.

This passage’s essence: non-interference is the ultimate moral governance for the world; action is the utmost achievement of worldly affairs. Learning while daily subtracting, until reaching non-action—thus one attains this.

**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Fixed Mind**

**The Sage has no fixed mind.**
**He said:**
The Sage values transformation and adaptation, following true spontaneity as if without mind.

**With the people’s mind as mind.**
**Ming Huang said:**
The Sage’s mind responds to things and follows sensation—response lies in sensation, hence no fixed mind. Though the mind is unfixed, it is always to transform goodness, thus constantly taking the people’s mind as mind.

**○ He said:**
Follow what benefits the people’s mind.

**○ Bi said:**
Action must always follow its natural course.

**○ Pan said:**
The Sage is still and exhausts nature, embodying true emptiness. Whatever is thought or done arises in response to things—like fire’s nature, which spreads without bound, yet follows the sun’s warmth to manifest its use. Thus, without clinging to any single thing, it suffices for all things endlessly.

The *Book of Documents* says:
*"Let my people be enlightened and wise.
The good, I too shall make good."*

**He said:**
When the people act in goodness, the Sage responds with goodness. When they act in evil, I too respond with goodness.
**He said:** Though the people may have those who act in evil, the Sage transforms them to goodness.
**○ Bi said:** Each follows its own function, thus goodness is never lost.
**○ Pan said:** Goodness and evil arise from deluded perception, deluded perception arises from selfishness. If one is open to the Great Dao, even though the eyes may discern good and evil, the heart holds no distinguishing thoughts.
Thus, the Sage follows the world’s emotions, firmly establishes praise and blame, and knows good and evil in the heart—yet originally, these are not fixed forms. Hence, when responding to evil as goodness, it is not out of pity or anger, but because one does not perceive them as different.
Thus, goodness is attained.

**He said:** When the people’s virtue is transformed, the Sage acts with goodness.
**○ Bi said:** Never abandon the people.
**○ Pan said:** To forget goodness and evil in responding with goodness is true goodness.

When the people are faithful, I too am faithful.
**He said:** When the people act with faith, the Sage responds with faith.
When they are unfaithful, I too respond with faith.
**He said:** When the people act with unfaith, the Sage transforms them to faith.
**○ Pan said:** Though all dharmas differ, they are equal in their true reality. Faith and unfaith arise from selfishness.
Thus, faith is attained.

**Ming Huang said:**
When I wish to cultivate goodness and faith among the people, I respond with goodness and faith. When they lack goodness and faith, I also teach them with goodness and faith, so that the people may be moved by my virtue and act in goodness and faith.
**○ He said:** When the people’s virtue is transformed, the Sage acts with faith.
**○ Pan said:** Knowing that all phenomena are not inherently false, the Sage responds to evil as if it were good. Knowing that all phenomena are not inherently real, the Sage responds to unfaith as if it were faith. When deluded, one knows reality; when real, one knows delusion—this is how the Sage’s wisdom differs from that of the common people.

The Sage’s presence in the world is **incautious**—
**Ming Huang** originally wrote *incautious*,
**Bi** originally wrote *restrained*.
**○ He said:** The Sage’s presence in the world is cautious, always fearing awe. Though rich and noble, he does not dare to be arrogant or extravagant.
He acts with a unified heart for the world.
**Ming Huang said:** The Sage, in governing the world, transforms and guides the people, always acting with an **incautious** heart, so that virtue, goodness, and faith may flourish while the Sage’s heart remains still and empty. Virtue shines with perfect clarity, and his unified, unrestrained heart serves the world entirely—thus, he acts with a unified heart for the world.
**○ He said:** This means the Sage makes the people’s hearts pure, as if they were simple and ignorant, not discerning.
**○ Pan said:** *Incautious* means fear and reverence. Though the Sage embodies emptiness and does not cling to any single thing, when he responds to the world, he never fails to observe proper conduct and restraint. For if he acts, even as a Sage, he does not dare to be careless.

The Sage takes the world as his heart, thus establishing all dharmas. The world takes the Sage as its heart, thus returning to the Great Dao.
The heart can perceive and distinguish, yet the Sage strives to return people to a state of undiscriminating awareness—thus, he acts with a unified heart.

(Alternative readings: *Incautious* originally written as *restrained*, meaning *restrained* in the sense of gathering and not dispersing, also acceptable. Another reading: *unified his heart*.)

The people all focus their ears and eyes,
**Ming Huang said:** The people, transformed by the Sage’s virtue, act in goodness, thus inclining their ears and eyes to observe and listen to the Sage.
**○ He said:** *Focus* means *utilize*.
The people all utilize their ears and eyes as the Sage’s means of perception.
**○ Bi said:** Each uses their wisdom and insight.
**○ Xiu said:** They look up to him and follow his ways.
The Sage treats them all as infants.
**Ming Huang said:** The Sage pities the common folk, as if they were tender infants, thus in all his dealings with the people, he acts as a loving mother would.
**○ He said:** The Sage loves and cherishes the people as infants and young children, nurturing them without expecting repayment.
**○ Bi said:** He makes them all harmonious and desireless, like infants.

Now, heaven and earth establish their positions, the Sage fulfills their capacities, and people scheme with both spirits and men. The people’s capacities are in harmony with what they can do, and those who can do it are given it. The greater their capacity, the greater their reward; the more noble their resources, the more noble their status. All things have their master, all affairs have their ruler. Thus, one may wear the crown and hold the scepter without fear of deceit, or block the ears with noise without suffering from arrogance. Why then would the Sage exert his own wisdom to discern the people’s emotions?

If one uses clarity to perceive things, things will also vie to respond with their own clarity. If one uses unfaith to perceive things, things will also vie to respond with unfaith.
The hearts of the world need not be the same, yet their responses dare not differ—then none will dare to utilize their true emotions.
Great is the harm of clarity! None is greater than using one’s own clarity.

If one relies on wisdom, people will dispute with him. If one relies on strength, people will contend with him. Wisdom that does not surpass others yet stands in the realm of dispute will be exhausted. Strength that does not surpass others yet stands in the realm of contention will be in peril.
There has never been one who can make people abandon their wisdom, nor one who can make people not use their wisdom and strength against him. Thus, he alone with one wisdom faces the people, while the people with myriad wisdoms face him alone.

If he multiplies his laws and nets, complicates his punishments, blocks their paths, and raids their hidden dwellings, then all things lose their natural order, the people lose their means of livelihood, chaos reigns above and below. Thus, the Sage’s heart toward the world is **restrained**, with no fixed attachment.
He acts with a unified heart for the world, his intentions wandering nowhere, his discernment nowhere fixed. The people have nothing to fear, nothing to respond to, nothing to seek. With nothing to fear and nothing to respond to, none will fail to utilize their true emotions.
No one should discard their own capacities to do what they cannot, nor abandon their strengths to do what they lack. Thus, those who speak do so from their knowledge, those who act do so from their abilities. The people all focus their ears and eyes, and I treat them all as infants.

**○ Pan said:** The ignorant people act without reason in all things. The Sage pities them and leads them gently, like parents guiding a child—bending and yielding to their inclinations, yet without resentment or anger. None but he who embodies the Dao and forgets things, whose compassion accompanies heaven and earth, could act thus.

**Chapter Fifty: Birth and Death**

**Birth and Death.**
The Sage said: Enlightenment brings birth; delusion and attachment bring death—this is the standard.

**○ He said:** Birth means the emotions and desires emerge from the five viscera, the spirit steadies, and the soul and vital essence remain tranquil—thus life. Death means the emotions and desires sink into the chest and mind, the spirit grows weary and confused—thus death.

**○ Bi said:** The realm of birth, the realm of death.

**○ Xiu said:** Those who are moved by the interplay of yin and yang cannot escape this—all because of their false attachment to life. There are thirteen paths to life, thirteen paths to death.

The Sage said: Broadly speaking, among all beings, those who live in accordance with life’s principles attain true life, and those who die in accordance with death’s principles attain true death. Such cases, in the grand scheme, are three out of ten.

**○ He said:** The categories of birth and death each have thirteen aspects—namely, the nine orifices and four passages. In life, the eyes do not gaze wantonly, the ears do not listen indiscriminately, the nose does not indulge in odors, the mouth does not speak idly, the tongue does not crave tastes, the hands do not grasp recklessly, the feet do not walk aimlessly, the vital essence does not stir in vain. In death, the opposite holds true.

**○ Pan said:** Those who claim to uphold the Dao often either cling to the vigor of yang and rely on its strength, or fixate on the stillness of yin and stagnate in decay—both are deviations from the true virtue and power, and thus become entangled in birth and death.

The paths that lead to death from life are also thirteen.

The Sage said: If one indulges life excessively, nourishing it at the cost of vitality, and clings too tightly to this life, then any movement leads to the realm of death. Such beings have already lost the principles of life and death—these are three out of every ten.

**○ He said:** The actions taken in pursuit of life lead one into thirteen realms of death.

**○ Pan said:** Excessive attachment to life harms one’s nature, so every movement brings injury.

Beyond the ignorant common folk, some uphold the Dao as a shield, while others indulge desire and court misfortune—all because they cling to life and thus cannot escape birth and death. Why is this?

**○ He said:** Why do they enter the realms of death? Because their attachment to life is too deep.

The Sage said: Why do they enter the realms of death? Because their pursuit of this life is excessively heavy—like the green grass, why does it not wither? Simply because their fixation on life is too intense.

**○ He said:** They enter the realms of death because their obsession with living is excessive, defying the natural order and acting without measure.

**○ Pan said:** The Perfect One knows neither death nor life, and thus neither dies nor lives. Therefore, it is said that they have never died, never lived. Those who fixate on yin or yang and become entangled in birth and death, or who indulge desire and court ruin, moving into the realms of death—these three categories differ in their appearances. Yet tracing their confusion from the true Dao’s rectitude, they still cling to life too heavily.

Some say: Those who pursue the Dao to the point of emaciation—are they not excessively attached to life?

It is said: My way is to transcend life and death, serene and ever one. Only by stilling falsehood can one attain this. But they cling to their perceptions, even to the point of emaciation. Though their intent may lean toward emptiness, their very fixation on this intent makes them the most attached to the self.

Now, those who excel in nurturing life—

**○ He said:** *Shè* (摄) means to nourish.

—walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers,

**○ He said:** They naturally avoid harm; danger does not reach them.

—enter battlefields without being struck by weapons,

**○ He said:** They do not delight in killing others.

—rhinoceroses have no place to thrust their horns, tigers no place to strike with their claws, weapons no place to lodge their blades.

The Sage said: Those who master the art of preserving life maintain a clear and tranquil mind, free from reckless intentions. Thus, all external harm cannot touch them. They do not seek to encounter rhinoceroses or tigers on land, nor to be struck by armored soldiers in battle—this is not inviting harm. Therefore, harm cannot reach their mind, and there is no place for horns to thrust, claws to strike, or blades to lodge.

**○ He said:** For those who nurture life, tigers and rhinoceroses cannot harm them, and weapons cannot reach them.

Why is this?

**○ He said:** Why do tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons not harm them? Because they have no realm of death.

The Sage said: Why do tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons have no place to strike? Because they follow the natural transformation without partiality, not treating death as death. Thus, harm cannot touch their life, and it is said they have no realm of death.

**○ He said:** Because they do not violate the thirteen paths of death, their spirit and clarity protect them—thus, harm cannot dare to approach.

**○ Bi said:** Thirteen refers to three out of ten—taking the extreme of the life-path where life is fully preserved, three out of ten. Taking the extreme of the death-path where death is fully realized, three out of ten as well. Yet common folk, with their excessive attachment to life, enter the realm of non-life.

Those who excel in nurturing life do not treat life as life, and thus have no realm of death.

The most harmful tools are spears and blades; the most harmful beasts are rhinoceroses and tigers. Yet those who do not burden themselves with desire are such that spears and blades find no place to strike, and rhinoceroses and tigers find no place to claw or gore. Truly, they do not invite harm upon themselves.

As for entering the realm of death—

The *yǎn* (蚖) and *tuó* (蟺) mistake deep waters for shallow and dig holes within them, while eagles and sea birds mistake mountains for lowlands and build nests upon them. Snares and nets cannot reach them, and traps cannot ensnare them—this is to dwell in a realm where death cannot touch. Yet they ultimately fall into the realm of non-life because of sweet bait. Is this not due to their excessive attachment to life?

Thus, if one does not abandon their root or sever their true nature, even entering battlefields will not harm them, nor will land travel invite assault.

The infant is worthy of emulation for its trustworthiness and sincerity.

○ **Hé** said: Those who dwell in the realm of non-death do so because they are without attachment to life. Those without attachment to life are perpetually alive yet do not cling to life themselves, so they never die nor ever truly live. When the Dao reaches this state, even if their form has *chán* (禅), their spirit remains unaltered—how could death ever touch them?

This is the sacred essence of the Central Kingdom, and the Buddha of the Western Realm.

If one is thus, their transformations are without end; water and fire cannot scorch or dampen them, and hewing or flogging cannot wound them. Moving through emptiness yet touching solidity, they go without obstruction—what desire could they possess, much less attain? How much more could they be harmed?

Someone asked: Then why is it called *shè shēng* (摄生)?
It was replied: Only when one descends to this lesser state does death and life become their domain. Thus, *shè shēng* must reach this point before life can be perpetually preserved.

This is akin to those with profound *dé* (德), the ultimate indeed.

**Chapter Fifty-One: The Dao Nourishes Life (《道生之》)**
The Dao nourishes life,
The *Míng Huáng* (明皇) said: The wondrous origin moves and harmonizes the *hé qì* (和气).
○ **Hé** (河) said: The Dao gives birth to all things.

The *virtue/power* (德) nurtures them,
The *Míng Huáng* said: Things thus receive the means to flourish and sustain all classes.
○ **Hé** said: The *virtue/power* is singular—one *virtue/power* spreads the *qi* (气) to give birth and to sustain.

Things take form from it,
The *Míng Huáng* said: The masculine principle knows, the feminine principle acts, and signs and portents establish their form and position.
○ **Hé** said: One endows all things with their shapes and likenesses.

Their *shì* (势) completes them.
The *Míng Huáng* said: The *shì* (势) of cold and heat each arises and fulfills its purpose.
○ **Hé** said: One endows all things with the *shì* (势) of cold and heat to complete them.
○ **Bì** (弼) said: Things first arise, then are nurtured; nurtured, then take form; formed, then are completed. What gives them birth? The Dao. What grants them nurture? *Virtue/power*. What endows them with form? Things themselves. What brings them to completion? Their *shì* (势). Yet because of their origin, they can exist without form; because of their *shì*, they can be completed without form.

All things thus arise, and all functions are fulfilled—all have their source, and none can escape the Dao.
Thus, when one traces it to its utmost, it is still the pursuit of the Dao.
Following their origins, each thing has its own Dao.

○ **Xiù** (秀) said: These four are all the Dao; yet because each attains its own Dao, they are merely *virtue/power*. *Virtue/power* is what is nurtured. When nurturing reaches its natural fulfillment and form is established, then it is merely things. Things having their form, then near and far interact, and the firm and yielding intertwine—each follows its *shì* (势) to manifest its state. Thus, *virtue/power* is the Dao’s division, things are the *virtue/power*’s instruments, and *shì* (势) is the principle of things. Understanding the Dao and *virtue/power*, then form and *shì* are not worth knowing, and one can effortlessly respond to all things.

Therefore, all things revere the Dao and hold *virtue/power* in high esteem.
The *Míng Huáng* said: All things arise from the Dao and *virtue/power*, hence their reverence and esteem.
○ **Hé** said: The Dao and *virtue/power* act without fail, stirring all things and teaching them.
○ **Bì** said: The Dao is the source from which things arise, and *virtue/power* is what things obtain. Arising from it, they cannot but gain; revering it, they cannot but be harmed—yet they must esteem it.

○ **Xiù** said: The Dao is exalted while *virtue/power* is humble; *virtue/power* is honored while things are cheapened. The exalted, like sovereigns and fathers, the honored, like gold and jade—this is the distinction between exaltation and honor.

The exaltation of the Dao and the honor of *virtue/power*—none confer titles upon them, yet they are perpetually natural.
The *Míng Huáng* and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) both interpreted this as conferring titles.
○ The *Míng Huáng* said: It speaks of the exaltation and honor of the Dao and *virtue/power*—not by artificial titles, but by the perpetual function of giving birth and completing, bestowed upon things naturally, hence their inherent honor.
○ **Hé** said: The Dao is singular, uncommanded; it calls forth all things and remains perpetually natural, responding like the shadow to the form.
○ **Páng** (雱) said: To receive a mandate from Heaven is to be the Son of Heaven; to receive a mandate from the Son of Heaven is to be a feudal lord. Having received a mandate, one can be degraded by those who gave it—yet the Dao precedes all things and governs their mandates. Who could artificially confer upon it? Thus, it remains perpetually natural.

Hence, the Dao nourishes life—it gives birth, nurtures, completes, matures, sustains, and protects it.
The *Míng Huáng* said: Therefore, no one fails to revere the Dao and honor *virtue/power*.
○ **Hé** said: The Dao’s work for all things is not merely giving birth, but also prolonging, nurturing, completing, maturing, and protecting their nature and life. A sovereign ruling a state and cultivating oneself should act likewise.

○ **Bì** said: It means completing their substance, each attaining its shelter and shade, without harming their essence.
○ **Páng** said: The *Míng Huáng*’s original text spoke of *virtue/power* nurturing them.

Giving birth yet not possessing,
○ **Hé** said: The Dao gives birth to all things, yet does not take possession—this is not for selfish gain.

Doing yet not relying,
○ **Hé** said: The Dao’s actions are not done with expectation of reward.
○ **Bì** said: Doing yet not possessing.

Nurturing yet not slaughtering,
○ **Hé** said: The Dao nurtures all things, yet does not slaughter them for use.
This is called *Xuán Dé* (玄德, Mysterious Virtue).
The *Míng Huáng* said: It is as explained in the chapter on *Zǎi Yíng Pò* (载营魄), where it speaks of human cultivation mirroring the Dao, and this chapter clarifies that the Dao’s application is akin to human use.

○ **Hé** said: The Dao’s actions are profound and dark, its *virtue/power* unseen.
○ **Bì** said: *Virtue/power* exists yet its master is unknown—it emerges from the depths of obscurity, hence *Xuán Dé* (玄德).
○ **Páng** said: The Dao, by not clinging to life, can thus perpetually nourish life. When it nourishes life, it is merely *virtue/power*.

**Chapter Fifty-Two: The Beginning of All Under Heaven (《天下有始》)**
All Under Heaven has a beginning,
And this beginning is the mother of All Under Heaven.
The *Míng Huáng* said: The beginning is the *chōng qì* (冲气, pristine *qi*), stating that this wondrous *qi* gives birth to and completes all things, possessing the nurturing *virtue/power* of flourishing, hence it can be the mother of All Under Heaven.

○ **Hé** said: The beginning has the Dao.
The Dao is the mother of all Under Heaven and all things.
○ **Bì** said: If one begins well, one will also nurture and sustain well. Thus, All Under Heaven having a beginning, it can be the mother of All Under Heaven.

○ **Hé** said: The mother of all named things is the Dao/Way. The beginning and the mother are fundamentally one—when the Dao/Way manifests all things, it is thus called the mother. Once one knows the mother, one can understand its offspring.

○ **Míng Huáng** said: When all things receive the pristine *chōng qì* (冲气) and its nurturing *virtue/power*, they recognize themselves as the offspring of this pristine *qi*.

○ **Hé** said: The offspring is the One. Having known the Dao/Way, one must then know the One.

○ **Hé** said: All things arise from the Dao/Way, making it their mother. Thus, they are called offspring—when one attains the Dao/Way, the principles of all things are known without need of recognition. Once one knows the offspring, one must then guard the mother.

○ **Hé** said: Having known the One, one must then guard the Dao/Way and return to non-action.

○ **Hé** said: The perfected sage, though meditating upon the principles of all things, knows that these principles have no fixed form. Thus, though he knows them, he does not follow them and depart from the Dao/Way. Hence, it is said: *"Return and guard its mother"* (复守其母). Thus, one’s body does not perish.

○ **Míng Huáng** said: Once one knows that the body is the offspring of pristine *chōng qì* (冲气), one must guard this harmonious and wondrous *qi*, preventing it from dispersing. Then, one’s body will never face danger or harm.

○ **Hé** said: No danger or harm.

○ **Bì** said: The mother is the root; the offspring is the end. By attaining the root, one knows the end. One must not abandon the root to chase the end.

○ **Hé** said: The root of *yuè* (兑, joy/delight) is where desires arise, and the root of *mén* (门, gate) is where desires follow.

○ **Hé** said: *Yuè* (兑) means delight—when a person delights, their form opens, hence it is called *yuè*. Once delighted, things enter. What is the cause of delight leading to the opening of one’s form? It is from not guarding the Dao/Way and recklessly pursuing the beauty of things, thus delighting and following them to manifest.

○ **Hé** said: The gate is where the spirit (神) emerges. Externally perceiving principles, one’s form opens to receive them, and then the spirit again emerges, mingling with them. This creates endless turmoil—all entanglements begin from here. Thus, one must block *yuè* (兑) and close the gate, always guarding the mother.

○ **Míng Huáng** said: *Yuè* (兑) is love and delight. The eyes delight in colors, the ears in sounds—each of the six senses (六根) has its own delight. If indulged, it leads to suffering. Therefore, one must block them.

○ By not indulging the six senses in love and delight, the door to calamity is closed. Thus, one’s life will never be weary or labored.

○ **Hé** said: If one blocks the eyes from reckless gazing and closes the mouth from reckless speech, then one’s life will never be weary.

○ **Bì** said: Without action, one remains forever at ease. Thus, one’s life will never be weary.

○ **Hé** said: Beyond blocking *yuè* (兑) and closing the gate, one responds to all things externally. Thus, one’s efforts are ample and ever sufficient.

○ **Hé** said: Opening *yuè* (兑) means gazing at desires. Indulging in desires leads to endless calamity.

○ **Míng Huáng** said: Opening the six senses, indulging in sight and sound to fulfill desires of love and delight, will always invite disaster. Thus, one’s life will never be saved.

○ **Hé** said: Disaster will flourish.

○ **Bì** said: If one does not close the source, yet indulges in its affairs, then one’s life will never be saved.

○ **Hé** said: Once *yuè* (兑) is opened, things enter. Then, one expends their spirit to indulge in these affairs, submitting internally to externally. Chasing things without return, who could save them from this current?

○ **Míng Huáng** said: When one can perceive even the smallest matters and adjust their conduct accordingly, this is called clarity.

○ **Hé** said: The seeds of disaster have not yet sprouted, nor have the signs of calamity appeared. The small is evident—only those who see it are clear.

○ **Hé** said: Guarding the Dao/Way means one’s perception is subtle; following principles means one’s knowledge is broad.

○ **Míng Huáng** said: Guarding softness is strength. If one guards softness and weakness, no one can overpower them—this is called strength.

○ **Hé** said: Guarding softness and weakness leads to ever-increasing strength.

○ **Bì** said: The efficacy of governance does not lie in grandiosity. Seeing what is grand is not clarity; seeing what is small is clarity. Guarding strength is not strength; guarding softness is strength.

○ **Hé** said: The sage’s light is the nature of fire. Fire’s nature is to envelop emptiness and shine, relying on fuel for its form. Once its illumination ceases, it returns to emptiness, initially not self-luminous, but only revealing light through fuel.

○ **Bì** said: Manifesting the Dao/Way to remove the people.

○ **Hé** said: The sage’s light shines through things. Things being without constancy, the light follows them. Though one’s responses may be endless, one does not weary from it. Who else in All Under Heaven could be as divine as this?

○ **Míng Huáng** said: Thus, one does not abandon their body to suffering.

○ **Hé** said: Internally observing to preserve the spirit, one does not fall into leakage.

This is called **Clinging to the Constant**.

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: *"遗 (yí)"* means *"with"*—that is, if one returns to guard the inner light, there will be none to harm or blame the body. Thus, this is called **secretly employing the Dao/Way of True Constancy**.

○ **Hé** said: If a person can practice this, it is called **cultivating the Constant Dao**.

○ **Bì** said: This is the **Constant of the Dao**.

○ **Páng** said: If there is such clarity, then there is a *self-view* (我相). Once the *self-view* is established, all things become calamities. Thus, one can only understand the earlier statement: *"and thus, there is ultimately no calamity."* Those outside this Dao are all subject to birth-and-death. Only by embodying this principle does one begin to **abide in constancy**.

*"Clinging"* means to **embody it while remaining unmanifest**.

---
**Chapter 53: "Make Me Firmly Aware"**

*"Make me firmly aware, walking the Great Dao..."*

○ **Hé** said: *"介 (jiè)"* means *"great."* Laozi laments that the rulers of his time do not walk the Great Dao, hence this statement: *"If I were firmly aware of governance, I would walk the Great Dao, embodying the transformation of non-action."*

*"Only what is applied is to be feared."*

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: Laozi speaks: *"If I were to stand firm in my awareness, desiring to walk the Great Dao, since it does not align with the Dao, then whatever is applied will be fearful."*

○ **Hé** said: *"唯 (wéi)"* means *"solely."* One fears only that what is applied deviates from the Dao’s intent—desiring to reward the virtuous risks fostering false virtue, desiring to trust the loyal risks giving rise to deceitful loyalty.

○ **Bì** said: *"If I were to stand firmly aware, walking the Great Dao in the world, then only what is applied is to be feared."*

○ **Páng** said: Even a slight awareness of the Dao, yet walking the Great Dao, already fears the act of governance. How much more so for those with great awareness? For this reason, the Dao of the Perfect Person does not harm the root with superficial actions.

When governance flourishes externally, the root within becomes hollowed out. Hence, the chapter concludes:

*"The Great Dao is most simple,"*

○ **Hé** said: *"夷 (yí)"* means *"plain and easy."*

*"yet the people prefer shortcuts."*

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: The Great Dao is plain and easy, yet those with awareness fear the multitude of affairs, seeking swiftness like travelers taking shortcuts. The harms of shortcuts are detailed below.

○ **Hé** said: *"径 (jìng)"* means *"crooked and not straight."* The Great Dao is utterly plain and easy, yet the people prefer crooked shortcuts. How much more so when governance obstructs the Great Dao? Hence, *"The Great Dao is most simple, yet the people prefer shortcuts."*

○ **Bì** said: The Great Dao is vast and upright, yet the people still abandon it and do not follow it, preferring shortcuts. How much more so when governance clogs the Great Dao? Thus, *"The Great Dao is most simple, yet the people prefer shortcuts."*

○ **Páng** said: Shortcuts may offer fleeting clarity, but those who stray from the Great Dao and indulge in governance are blinded by near-term wisdom and lack long-term vision.

*"The court is excessively adorned,"*

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: *"尚贤 (shàng xián)"* and *"矜智 (jīn zhì)"* give rise to cunning deceit. *"除 (chú)"* means *"to govern."* The court is adorned with high towers and palaces.

○ **Hé** said: The court is adorned with false elegance, valuing external splendor.

*"Fields lie fallow,"*

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: Gluttonous feasting and idleness neglect farming.

○ **Hé** said: Farming is abandoned; the land is left untended.

*"Granaries are empty,"*

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: The southern fields yield no harvest, and there are no reserves.

○ **Hé** said: The five grains are harmed; the state has no stores.

○ **Bì** said: When the court is excessively adorned, the fields lie fallow, and the granaries become empty. One action leads to countless harms.

○ **Páng** said: Tending the fields and filling the granaries are the foundations of the state. Now, the court pursues superficial glory while neglecting the exhausted roots—how can this be a lasting path? All who harm the root with superficial actions are the same.

*"Wearing ornate robes,"*

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: Carving and embroidery drain labor and resources.

○ **Hé** said: Indulging in adornment, valuing external display.

*"Bearing sharp swords,"*

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: When moral cultivation is neglected, there is reliance on martial preparedness.

○ **Hé** said: Favoring strength, indulging in martial excess.

*"Gluttonous in food and drink,"*

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: Feasting on rich meats and fresh delicacies, indulging in taste.

*"厌 (yàn)"* means *"sated."*

*"Wealth overflows."*

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: Hoarding treasures and accumulating rare riches.

○ **Hé** said: Excessive desires, without restraint.

○ **Páng** said: Extravagance externally to seek fleeting comfort, while neglecting the roots—this is clearly harming the root through superficial governance.

*(One variant reads: "货财有余" – "commodities and wealth in excess.")*

*"This is called 'robber’s vanity.'"*

○ **Hé** said: When the people lack, yet the ruler has excess, it is because they plunder like thieves for adornment, boasting to others, unaware that death and ruin will follow, along with their kin.

*"This is not the Dao."*

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: Standing firm in awareness, yet actions only bring ruin—governing like a thief while boasting, vanity and theft are not the Dao. This only invites sighs.

○ **Hé** said: If a ruler governs thus, this is not the Dao. The repeated *"also"* (哉) is a lament.

○ **Bì** said: If one does not obtain things by their proper means, they are all crooked. Crookedness is theft; boasting without proper means is vanity and theft. Holding high rank without proper means is usurpation. Thus, all that is not the Dao is theft and vanity.

○ **Páng** said: Thieves seek fleeting glory; the vain seek external adornment. Those who walk the Dao cultivate deep roots and unexhausted virtue—how could they indulge in governance for superficial gain?

**Chapter 54: "The Well-Built Cannot Be Uprooted"**

*"The well-built cannot be uprooted,"*

**Emperor Ming Huang** said: Those who skillfully establish the state and its foundations with the Dao cannot be overturned.

○ **Hé** said: *"建 (jiàn)"* means *"to establish."* Those who skillfully establish themselves and their state with the Dao cannot be pulled up and uprooted.

○ **Bì** said: First, fortify the root, then cultivate the branches—thus, it cannot be uprooted.

「○ **Hé** said: *"Jiàn"* means *"central harmony."* Those who skillfully embrace the core cannot be severed.

○ **Mínghuáng** said: Those who skillfully embrace the people with the Dao cannot be abandoned.

○ **Hé** said: Those who embrace the spirit with the Dao cannot be pulled up, extracted, or liberated.

○ **Bì** said: It is not a matter of abundance, but of equalizing one’s capacity—thus, it cannot be severed.

○ **Hé** said: *"Bào yī"* means *"embracing unity."* When descendants fail to repay sacrifices with proper rites,

○ **Mínghuáng** said: This refers to a ruler who embraces virtue and the Dao, whose benevolence extends to posterity—how much more so to his descendants? The Zhou Dynasty’s rise began with **Hòujì** (后稷), perfected by **Wénwǔ** (文武), and though divinations predicted its replacement after thirty generations and a lifespan of seven hundred years, the sacrifices to **Hòujì** and **Wénwǔ** were never ceased.

○ **Hé** said: If descendants uphold the Dao in this manner, they attain eternal life and longevity, their sacrifices to ancestors and the ancestral temple enduring without interruption through generations.

○ **Bì** said: If descendants transmit this Dao through sacrifices, then the rites will never cease.

○ **Hé** said: The sage governs self and others, centering on *embracing unity and central harmony*—this is the ultimate principle of governance, immutable as heaven and earth. Thus, the law they leave behind is endless, their merit encompassing the four seas, and all under heaven and the spirits unite in reverence, their blessings extending to the remotest descendants.

*"Yīběn wúyǐ zì"* (一本无以字): Cultivate it within oneself, and its virtue becomes authentic.

○ **Mínghuáng** said: Cultivate the Dao within oneself, and its virtue becomes pure and true.

○ **Hé** said: Cultivate the Dao within oneself, cherish *qi* and nourish the spirit, thereby prolonging life and extending years—such is the virtue of the **Zhēnrén** (真人, True Person).

*"Xiū zhī jiā, qí dé nài yú"* (修之家，其德乃余): Cultivate it within the family, and its virtue becomes abundant.

○ **Mínghuáng** said: If the entire family cultivates it, its virtue overflows with blessings.

○ **Hé** said: Cultivate the Dao within the family, where fathers are benevolent, sons filial, brothers harmonious, younger siblings obedient, husbands trustworthy, and wives chaste—such virtue yields enduring blessings, reaching future generations of descendants.

○ **Bì** said: This extends from self to others—cultivate it within oneself, and its virtue is authentic; cultivate it within the family, and its virtue overflows abundantly. If cultivation is never neglected, its application is vast and profound.

*"Xiū zhī xiāng, qí dé nài zhǎng"* (修之乡，其德乃长): Cultivate it within the village, and its virtue becomes enduring.

○ **Mínghuáng** said: If the entire village cultivates it, its virtue becomes lasting.

○ **Hé** said: Cultivate the Dao within the village, honoring elders and loving the young, teaching the foolish and instructing the ignorant—such virtue ensures none are left uncovered.

*"Xiū zhī guó, qí dé nài fēng"* (修之国，其德乃丰): Cultivate it within the state, and its virtue becomes abundant.

○ **Mínghuáng** said: If the entire state cultivates it, its virtue becomes full and rich.

○ **Hé** said: Cultivate the Dao within the state, and the ruler is trustworthy while ministers are loyal; benevolence and righteousness arise naturally, rituals and music flourish spontaneously, governance is fair and impartial—such virtue is profound and thick for the people.

*"Xiū zhī tiānxià, qí dé nài pǔ"* (修之天下，其德乃普): Cultivate it across the world, and its virtue becomes universal.

○ **Mínghuáng** said: If all under heaven cultivate it, its virtue spreads universally.

○ **Hé** said: When the sovereign cultivates the Dao across the world, transformation occurs without words, governance without instruction—those below respond as shadows follow their forms, with unwavering trust. Such virtue is universal and broad.

○ **Hé** said: By extending the method of self-cultivation outward, virtue becomes abundant, then enduring, then rich, and finally universal. Thus, observing oneself with the law of self-cultivation,

○ **Mínghuáng** said: Observing oneself with the method of self-cultivation, one who attains clarity and tranquility is the True Person.

○ **Hé** said: Observing the self that cultivates the Dao with the self that does not, one discerns which perishes and which survives.

Observing the family with the method of family cultivation,

○ **Mínghuáng** said: Observing the family with the method of family cultivation, one that achieves harmony and accord has abundant virtue.

○ **Hé** said: Observing the family that cultivates the Dao with the family that does not, one discerns their differences.

Observing the village with the method of village cultivation,

○ **Mínghuáng** said: Observing the village with the method of village cultivation, one that follows order and sequence has enduring virtue.

○ **Hé** said: Observing the village that cultivates the Dao with the village that does not, one discerns their distinctions.

Observing the state with the method of state cultivation,

○ **Mínghuáng** said: Observing the state with the method of state cultivation, one that practices diligence and frugality has rich virtue.

○ **Hé** said: Observing the state that cultivates the Dao with the state that does not, one discerns their disparities.

○ **Bì** said: All these distinctions are evident.

Observing the world with the method of world cultivation,

○ **Mínghuáng** said: Observing the world with the method of world cultivation, one that practices *wuwei* (無為, non-action) attains universal virtue.

○ **Hé** said: Observing the sovereign who cultivates the Dao with the sovereign who does not, one discerns their differences.

○ **Bì** said: Observing the world’s hundred families with the heart of the world’s people, the Dao of the world mirrors the Dao of individuals—its reversals and conformities, its fortune and misfortune, are all as with the Dao of a single person.

○ **Hé** said: The sage’s approach to all things is to exhaust the principles of reason without indulging private wisdom—thus, there is nothing they cannot master.

Thus, cultivating oneself aligns with the principles of one’s body, exhausting one’s body’s principles brings self-governance. From this point onward, governing a family means taking the family as one’s heart, governing a village means taking the village as one’s law. Such is the way—encountering ever broader applications, ever more abundant blessings.

The *Shū* (书, *Classic of Documents*) says: *"Heaven is wise and clear, and so are my people."* The sage is but heaven itself. How do I know the world is as such? By this.

○ **Mínghuáng** said: By observing this method of self, family, and world, one can understand it thus.

○ **Hé** said: The **Lǎozǐ** (老子) states how I know that those who cultivate the Dao flourish while those who abandon it perish—by observing these five matters.

○ **Bì** said: This is what was previously said: *"How do I know the world?"* By examining oneself, seeking no further. This is the meaning of *"not stepping outside the door to know the world."*»»»»○ **Hé** said: The sage upholds a single Dao, admitting no divergent teachings—thus, their means of action and means of knowing all arise from this Dao.

**Chapter 55: "The Thickness of Embracing Virtue"**

**Chapter 55: "Embracing the Depth of Virtue"**

**Embracing the Depth of Virtue**
**Hé** said: It refers to those who embrace the profound virtue of Dao and morality, comparing them to an infant.

**Mínghuáng** said: The perfected sage, embracing the depth of virtue, acts like an infant.

○ **Hé** said: The divine protection of virtue’s endurance is like a parent’s care for an infant.

○ **Péng** said: Virtue is never inherently shallow, yet it becomes so through deliberate concern and calculation. Thus, preserving one’s true nature without external depletion or internal dissipation allows pure *qi* to accumulate within, filling the human path to its fullest—worthy of being called great. Therefore, it is no wonder that one may tame tigers and leopards, subdue spirits and gods.

Someone asked: *Why then cannot an infant do these things?*
It was replied: The preservation of pure *qi* is not something a single body can fully contain. In the corrupt ages, though one may have the form of an infant, their lost true nature has long since faded. How could the world truly understand this?

Poisonous creatures do not sting,
**Hé** said: Bees, fireflies, snakes, and venomous serpents do not sting.

Fierce beasts do not attack,
Grasping crows do not snatch.

**Mínghuáng** said: The perfected sage is divine—harm cannot touch them. Since they harbor no intent to harm, there is no ground for retaliation. This is the depth of virtue in the perfected sage.

○ **Hé** said: The infant harms no thing, and no thing harms it. Thus, in the age of great peace, all people—regardless of rank—possess benevolence. Even creatures with venom return to their natural state, and poisonous beasts do not harm humans.

○ **Bì** said: The infant has no desires or cravings, does not offend against things, so venomous creatures do not strike them. Those who embrace deep virtue do not offend against things, and thus nothing can diminish their wholeness.

○ **Péng** said: The preservation of pure *qi* suffices for this.

I have often reasoned thus: All things harm one another because their *qi* is received unevenly. Humans, as the noblest of creatures, inherit the utmost harmony, yet sometimes suffer harm from things due to losing their natural state. Thus, yin and yang achieve harmony through the balance of *qi*. Only by guarding the true, harmonious *qi* can one prevent harm from entering like a door.

Yet even this is but the virtue of the great person—still not the sage.

Their bones are weak, their sinews supple, yet their grip is firm,
**Hé** said: Though an infant’s bones and sinews are weak, their grasp is unyielding because their will and heart do not waver.

○ **Bì** said: Because of their very weakness, their grasp is firm.

They do not know the union of male and female yet [their vitality] thrives,
**Bì** said: *Thrive* means *grow*.

Nothing can harm their body, so they remain whole and grow. Those who embrace deep virtue suffer no harm to their virtue, no corruption of their true nature. Gentle and yielding, they are never broken—all such as this. This is the pinnacle of essence.

**Hé** said: Though the infant does not know the union of yin and yang, yet their *qi* surges—this is due to the abundance of their vital essence.

○ **Péng** said: It is not from external desire that their *qi* surges, but from following their natural flow without the interference of the heart. If one’s eyes wander outward while the mind strays inward, essence is lost, and death follows. How could such a one endure?

The greatest affliction of the age is this, and the most solemn warning for the scholar.

Crying all day yet their voice does not grow hoarse,
**Bì** originally wrote *hoarse* as *ya* (噫).

○ **Bì** said: Without the burden of desire, they cry all day yet their voice does not grow hoarse.

This is the ultimate harmony.

**Mínghuáng** said: The infant’s bones are weak, their sinews supple, yet their clenched fist is firm. They do not know the pairing of yin and yang, yet their source of *qi* thrives. Their movements are like the essence at its purest. Crying all day yet their voice does not grow hoarse—this is the ultimate harmony of the infant.

○ **Hé** said: From morning to evening, the infant’s cries do not change—this is due to the abundance of harmonious *qi*.

○ **Péng** said: Mencius said: *"Nurturing rectitude without harm, one fills the space between heaven and earth—this is harmonious *qi*."* In the other, it is called vast; here, it is called harmony. Though the names differ, the *qi* is one. Thus, when heart and *qi* move together, straying from principle and losing constancy leads to ruin. Is it that their inherent nature was different? It is merely that they did not hold to the proper way.

Those who preserve their virtue whole may interact with things physically, yet their heart remains tranquil. Thus, though they use *qi*, it moves of its own accord. Therefore, though they act, there is no burden of action. Yet relying on the preservation of pure *qi*, who could disturb them?

Thus, even in old age, they do not lose the constancy of the infant. Guāngchéngzǐ cultivated his body for twelve hundred years without decay—this is how it is.

*Hoarse* (*sè*) is the summer season, when heaven’s harmony disperses. The hoarseness of the throat (*sè*) comes from the lack of accumulated harmonious *qi*. Another version reads *ya* (噫), meaning dispersed breath.

*Ya* also means *truth*, and is acceptable.

**Knowing the constancy of harmony,**
**Mínghuáng** said: To remain like an infant, steadfast in gentle harmony—this is the practice of knowing constancy.

○ **Hé** said: If one knows the benefit of harmonious *qi*’s gentleness to humanity, then they understand the constancy of the Dao.

○ **Bì** said: Things take harmony as their constancy; thus, knowing harmony is to grasp constancy.

○ **Péng** said: The constancy of returning to one’s true nature is the embodiment of spirit. Knowing the constancy of harmony is guarding *qi*. To know how to guard *qi* is to speak of returning to one’s true nature—though not yet having attained it. These two are what make the sage the sage and the worthy the worthy; there is no other path.

Ancient scholars all began here. With the Great Dao hidden, scholars pursued trivialities while forgetting the root. Learning began to stray beyond this.

Constancy is the fixed portion of nature. If one fully realizes their nature, they naturally distinguish themselves from things, and nothing can alter them. Thus, it is called constancy.

「For what lies beyond the fixed portion of nature, all else is artifice and deceit, with no constancy.

Knowing constancy is called *ming* (明).
The enlightened sovereign said: Guarding harmony and knowing constancy is called *mingliào* (明了).

○ **Hé** (河) said: If one can act in accordance with the constancy of the Dao/Way, then it is called attaining *ming* (明) to penetrate the profound and mysterious.

○ **Bì** (弼) said: Neither hunger nor oblivion, neither warmth nor cold—this is constancy.
Without form, it cannot be perceived with the eyes; this is called *ming* (明).

○ **Péng** (雱) said: Those who do not know constancy, though they possess slight wisdom in discerning things, yet fail to align with the Great Root—still, they may be said to have *ming* (明).

*Yìshēng* (益生) is auspicious signs.
The enlightened sovereign said: Auspicious signs are omens of fortune or misfortune; if one does not know how to guard constancy but instead seeks to augment life beyond its proper measure, they stir themselves toward death’s domain—this is called inauspicious signs.

○ **Hé** (河) said: Auspicious (*xiáng* 祥) means longevity.
It speaks of augmenting life to grow and expand oneself.

○ **Bì** (弼) said: Life cannot be augmented; to augment it is to invite monstrosity.

○ **Péng** (雱) said: The principle of life is already complete, with neither deficiency nor excess. If one nourishes it uprightly, it will reach its fullness. To add further is but to encumber it. Auspicious signs are matters beyond the ordinary.

When the mind compels *qi*, it is called *qiáng* (强).

The enlightened sovereign said: The mind has judgments of right and wrong, while *qi* has no discrimination. If one forces the mind to compel *qi*, then they are the kind of strong-willed, domineering people.

○ **Hé** (河) said: The mind should be singularly harmonious and soft, while *qi* naturally manifests as internal duality, hence the body appears soft.
Yet if one reverses this, allowing *qi* to act recklessly, harmony departs from the center, and thus the form becomes rigid and strong.

○ **Bì** (弼) said: The mind ought not to compel *qi*—that is *qiáng* (强).

○ **Péng** (雱) said: If the mind compels *qi*, then *qi* in turn compels the mind. When mind and *qi* mutually compel each other, the natural harmony is ruined, and one’s true essence is diminished. What people receive is not something that can be augmented or diminished; thus, to increase life or deplete *qi* is both a loss of principle.

Mencius warned against cultivating the *shùmiáo* (枢苗) without weeding, while Laozi spoke of augmenting life and compelling *qi*—all these aim to preserve their pure *qi* (淳气).

This is not the strength of self-mastery, but the strength of domineering force.

When things reach their peak, they age.
○ **Hé** (河) said: All things, when they reach their full vigor, become withered and aged.

This is called *bùdào* (不道).

○ **Hé** (河) said: The aged do not attain the Dao/Way.

○ **Péng** (雱) said: The vigor and aging of people are matters of form.
Yet for those who possess a fixed portion of nature, they remain constant and unchanging. Those who have lost their true nature undergo transformations in form and mind—thus, when they are vigorous, their blood and *qi* overflow, and when aged, their spirit and vitality wane. Only those with profound *dé* (德) are otherwise: my mind has never strayed, so *qi* also remains constant and unchanging. Though the body may outwardly display vigor or aging, the mind does not differ from that of an infant—these are the ones who have attained the Dao/Way.

All things that change with the seasons and follow the cycles of vigor and aging are mere things; how can they be the Dao/Way?

Those who do not follow the Dao/Way age prematurely.
The enlightened sovereign said: All things, when they reach their peak, decline into aging—thus, the warning against pride in strength and arrogance in vigor means that such behavior does not accord with the Dao/Way, and one must cease early.

○ **Hé** (河) said: Those who do not attain the Dao/Way age prematurely—this is death.

○ **Péng** (雱) said: Those who do not follow the Dao/Way, even in their youth, have already lost the principle of life—thus, it is called premature aging.

**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Silent Wisdom of the Knowing**
The knowing do not speak.」

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: The Silent Wisdom of the Knowing (Continued)**

**Hé** said: The knowing value action, not speech.
○ **Bì** said: Follow spontaneity.
○ **Xiāo** said: Principle reaches its peak in silence.
Those who speak do not know.
The Enlightened Sovereign said: *Knowing* means awakening. *Speech* means argumentation.
○ **Hé** said: A four-horse chariot cannot outpace the tongue—many words bring many calamities.
○ **Bì** said: They create discord.
○ **Péng** said: Once one speaks, they have already strayed from true understanding.

**塞其兑** *(Block its mouth)*
The Enlightened Sovereign said: Those who awaken are unattached to teachings and do not cling to words—thus, it is said, *block its mouth*.
○ **Péng** said: Their spirit is undivided.

**闭其门** *(Close its gate)*
The Enlightened Sovereign said: When there is no attachment, the gate of desires is closed.
○ **Hé** said: To block and close is to cut off its source.

**挫其锐** *(Dull its sharpness)*
**Hé** said: When desires sharpen, one must recall the Dao’s non-action to blunt them.
○ **Bì** said: Nurture simplicity.

**解其纷** *(Untangle its chaos)*
**Hé** said: *Halting* refers to unresolved grudges—one must recall the Dao’s non-action to release them.
○ **Bì** said: Remove the roots of contention.

**和其光** *(Harmonize its brilliance)*
**Hé** said: Though one may possess singular insight, it must be harmonized to merge with obscurity, lest it disrupt with glare.
○ **Bì** said: Without singular display, all things remain free of partiality.

**同其尘** *(Unify its dust)*
**Hé** said: One must not distinguish oneself.
○ **Bì** said: Without partiality, all things remain free of shame.
○ **Péng** said: True knowing dwells thus within oneself.
This is called *Xuántóng* *(Mysterious Unity)*.

The Enlightened Sovereign said: Its resolution is as in *Chapter on the Dao’s Effortless Flow*—there, it speaks of the Dao; here, it speaks of the person. To say that a person embodies the Dao is to share in *Mysterious Unity’s virtue*.
○ **Hé** said: *Xuán* is Heaven—when a person acts in accordance with these highest matters, it is to align with Heaven’s Dao.
○ **Péng** said: When the Dao reaches *Xuán*, subject and object become one—without establishing self to oppose others, others cannot possess it.
Thus, it cannot be *intimately known*—
The Enlightened Sovereign said: Mysterious Unity is without bias, hence it cannot be *intimately known*.
○ **Hé** said: It does not take honor as joy, nor solitude as sorrow.
It cannot be *distanced*—
The Enlightened Sovereign said: It blends universally with all, hence it cannot be *distanced*.
○ **Hé** said: With a tranquil mind and no desires, it harbors no grievance toward others.
○ **Bì** said: If it can be *intimately known*, it can also be *distanced*.

It cannot be *exploited*—
The Enlightened Sovereign said: Without desires, it cannot be *exploited*.
○ **Hé** said: The body does not crave wealth and rank; the mouth does not crave the five flavors.

It cannot be *harmed*—
The Enlightened Sovereign said: Without contention, it cannot be *harmed*.
○ **Hé** said: It does not contend with the powerful for gain, nor with the bold for vigor.
○ **Bì** said: If it can be *exploited*, it can also be *harmed*.

It cannot be *elevated*—
The Enlightened Sovereign said: To embody the Dao naturally is to transcend elevation.
○ **Hé** said: It does not serve as a ruler in chaotic times, nor occupy a position under a tyrannical lord.

Nor can it be *degraded*—
The Enlightened Sovereign said: Pure and untainted, it transcends degradation.
○ **Hé** said: It does not rely on power to become proud, nor does it bend its will to avoid humiliation.
○ **Bì** said: If it can be *elevated*, it can also be *degraded*.

Thus, it is *noble beyond the world*.
The Enlightened Sovereign said: With awakening unobstructed, speech flows effortlessly; sharpness and chaos are resolved, brilliance and dust unified—neither intimate nor distant, neither elevated nor degraded, it is the world’s supreme responsibility.
○ **Hé** said: Its virtue is such that even the Son of Heaven cannot subdue it, nor lords bend it. It floats with the world, preserves itself, and avoids harm—thus, it is *noble beyond the world*.
○ **Bì** said: Nothing can surpass it.
○ **Péng** said: The silent do not speak in secrecy, but truly have nothing to say—why? Because they perceive no single principle.
To perceive no single principle means they are not ensnared by things, yet are not ensnared by things—how much more so can they be *intimately known, distanced, elevated, or degraded*? They are merely things.
Those who are not ensnared by things yet do not ensnare things—thus, though unhonored, they are always noble.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing with Rectitude**

**以正治国** *(Govern with rectitude)*
**Hé** said: *Yǐ* means *reach*. Heaven appoints those who rectify themselves to govern with daily rectitude.
○ **Péng** said: Governing the nation lies in exhausting the Dao’s rectitude alone—there is no room for private wisdom.

**以奇用兵** *(Employ the unconventional in warfare)*
**Hé** said: *Qí* means *deception*. Heaven appoints those skilled in deceit and falsehood to wield arms.
○ **Péng** said: War is not an instrument of the Dao, yet the Sage cannot do without it—only it must not be relied upon habitually, hence *employ the unconventional*.

**以无事取天下** *(Conquer the world with non-action)*
The Enlightened Sovereign said: To govern the world lies in *non-action*—if one governs through policies and teachings, or employs unconventional warfare, these are all contrary to the Dao. Only through *non-action and non-doing* can one conquer the world—these three sentences mark the standard.
○ **Hé** said: Heaven appoints those of *non-action and non-doing* to take the world as their ruler.
○ **Bì** said: To govern with the Dao brings peace; to govern with rectitude sparks unconventional warfare.

To conquer with *non-action* is to truly take the world.
The previous chapter states: Those who take the world always act with *non-action*—when they act, they are unworthy of taking the world.
Thus, to govern with rectitude is unworthy of taking the world, and so one employs unconventional warfare.
When one governs with rectitude but neglects the root, the branches grow shallow—people have nothing to grasp, hence it descends to unconventional warfare.
○ **Péng** said: To govern with rectitude means the world submits naturally—why resort to action?

「Indeed, the divine treasures of the world can only be possessed by those who practice *non-action*.
Hence, it is said below:

How do I know this to be so? By this.
**Mínghuáng** said: By this, one understands the lower realm.
○ **Hé** said: This refers to the present. *Lǎozi* spoke: How do I know Heaven’s intent to be thus? By what I see today.

The world abounds with prohibitions, yet the people grow ever poorer.
**Mínghuáng** said: When governing with strict decrees, one multiplies prohibitions, causing the people to abandon their livelihoods, thus making them ever poorer.
○ **Hé** said: The world refers to the sovereign. Prohibitions are restrictions. Too many decrees breed deceit, while excessive prohibitions risk the people’s survival, hence poverty.
○ **Péng** said: When affairs are restricted by prohibitions, the people are disturbed and lose their livelihoods—this is where chaos begins.

When the people wield many clever tools, the state grows more corrupt.
**Mínghuáng** said: Clever tools refer to stratagems. If the sovereign relies too heavily on stratagems, unable to return to simplicity, the people respond with deceit—thus the state grows ever more corrupt and chaotic.
○ **Hé** said: The people are the sovereigns and feudal lords. Many who favor cleverness—engraving palaces, embroidering robes, and adorning strange objects—lead the people to imitate them, lavishing gold, iron, jade, and vibrant dyes, worsening the trend daily.
○ **Bì** said: When the people are too clever, cunning arises. When cunning arises, evil deeds multiply.
○ **Péng** said: In ancient times, the people’s tools were crude and simple. As customs grew refined, their craftsmanship became ever more intricate, cleverness flourished, and morals declined—thus, extraordinary things increased.

One root benefits; the branches grow many.
When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits abound.
**Mínghuáng** and **Wáng Bì** both refer to *objects* as *decrees*.
○ **Mínghuáng** said: When *non-action* is lost and laws and decrees multiply, those who steal laws become criminals, and all become thieves and bandits—is this not their abundance?
○ **Hé** said: Laws and decrees refer to treasured objects. When rare and luxurious items proliferate, farming is neglected, and hunger and cold ensue—thus thieves and bandits abound.
○ **Bì** said: Establishing rectitude seeks to suppress evil, yet unconventional warfare is employed. Many prohibitions seek to shame poverty, yet the people grow ever poorer.
Those who desire clever tools to strengthen the state only make it more corrupt and chaotic—all stem from prioritizing the branches over the root, thus leading to this.

Therefore, the Sage says:」

「Hé said: This refers to *governing the people*.

When I practice *non-action*, the people transform themselves.
Hé said: The Sage speaks of my cultivation of the Dao/Way and alignment with Heaven, making no alterations, yet the people transform themselves naturally.

○ **Páng** said: *Non-action* means maintaining the constant Way. When the ruler maintains the constant Way, the people also maintain their constant Way, hence they transform themselves.
*Expanding upon the previous point about clever tools*: When I love tranquility, the people naturally become upright.
Hé said: The Sage speaks of my love of tranquility, not saying "do not teach," yet the people all become naturally loyal and upright.
○ **Páng** said: Loving tranquility means returning to one's true nature. When the ruler returns to their true nature, the people also return to their true nature, hence they become upright.

*Expanding upon the previous point about thieves and bandits*: When I have no interference, the people naturally become wealthy.
Hé said: When I have no burdens of forced labor or conscription, the people are secure in their livelihoods, hence they all naturally become wealthy.
○ **Páng** said: *Non-action* and loving tranquility mean I have no need for interference, and thus the people fulfill their lives. How could there be so many prohibitions?

When I have no desires, the people naturally become simple.
Mínghuáng said: *Non-action* leads to purity and tranquility, hence the people transform themselves.
Having no interference means no disturbance, hence the people naturally become wealthy.
Loving tranquility means attaining one's true nature, hence the people naturally become upright.
Having no desires means preserving harmony, hence the people naturally become simple.
This is the way to acquire the world without interference.

○ Hé said: I always have no desires. I abandon ornate speech and elaborate dress, and the people follow me in simplicity and plainness.
○ **Bì** said: The ruler’s desires, the people follow them swiftly.
My only desire is to have no desires, and thus the people also have no desires and naturally become simple.
These four principles honor the root to suppress the branches.

○ **Páng** said: *Expanding upon the previous point about strange objects*: I have often reasoned that the Sage’s governance transforms through *non-action*, upholds uprightness through loving tranquility, allows all to fulfill their potential in wealth and abundance, and ultimately returns them to simplicity. Thus, there are no clever tools or strange objects, nor are laws and decrees used as means of control.

The people’s tendency to abandon simplicity and pursue artifice all stems from excessive desires. If the ruler truly has no desires, how could the people obtain desires? This is the ultimate attainment of the *Emperor-Sage*.」

**Translation:**

**The Way of Governance (闷闷者第五十八)**

**He** said: Its governance and teachings are broad and expansive, dim and indistinct, as though unclear. Yet its people are pure and sincere.

**The Emperor-Sage** said: When governance is broad and expansive, without contrivance, the people respond with sincerity and natural simplicity.

**He** said: Because governance is broad and expansive, the people become pure, wealthy, and harmonious with one another.

**Bi** said: The art of good governance lies in having no fixed form or name, no rigid structures or strictures. Yet it achieves great order through this very dimness—thus it is called *dim governance*. The people, unburdened by competition, thrive in broad sincerity—thus it is called *pure people*.

**The Way of Governance (察察者)**

**He** said: Its governance is sharp and hasty, with decrees spoken and heard in haste.

**Páng** said: *察察* is excessive governance.

**The people are *缺缺*.**

**The Emperor-Sage** said: When governance is sharp and hasty, the people respond with depletion and decay.

**He** said: When governance is urgent, the people suffer hardship, and thus their vitality dwindles day by day.

**Bi** said: By establishing laws and punishments, distinguishing right from wrong, and suppressing deceit, governance becomes *察察*. When distinctions are rigidly drawn, the people grow contentious—thus it is called *缺缺*.

**Páng** said: *缺缺* refers to the broken and incomplete, as with shattered vessels.

**Disaster is the reverse of fortune.**

**He** said: *倚* means *to arise from*.

When disaster arises from fortune, those who suffer it may repent, reflect, and cultivate virtue—thus disaster departs and fortune returns.

**Fortune is the hidden source of disaster.**

**He** said: Disaster lies concealed within fortune. When fortune breeds arrogance, fortune departs and disaster comes.

**Who knows its ultimate measure?**

**The Emperor-Sage** said: *倚* means *to arise from*; *伏* means *to be concealed within*.

When governance is *dim*, the people assume there is no principle at work, yet they return to sincerity and simplicity—this is how disaster arises from fortune. When governance is *sharp*, the people assume rigid order prevails, yet they wither and decay—this is how fortune conceals disaster.

**He** said: Disaster and fortune alternate; who can fathom their limits?

**Páng** said: All things flow through the unity of *qi*, and the movement of *qi* cycles endlessly—returning to its beginning, shifting like water, with no ultimate end. Thus disaster and fortune succeed one another like the four seasons. The Sage knows this, so governance values moderation, avoiding excess. If governance is *察察*, seeking to uphold the proper and suppress the strange, to curb the anomalous and promote the good—all to exhaust fortune in the world—it fails to recognize that proper and strange, anomalous and good, transform into one another. Seeking fortune, it does not know that fortune’s excess becomes disaster. Thus Zhuangzi spoke in parable of the *dim* between talent and lack of talent. Then, in governance, is it not also the *dim* between discernment and obscurity?

Thus it is said: *dim governance*—for if one does not distinguish between good and evil, right and wrong, the lesser wise may find it unsettling. This aligns with the saying *"wild and boundless."* For in both cases, the logic is the same.

**Is there no proper way?**

*(The Emperor-Sage and Bi’s texts both originally include "邪" beneath "正")*

**He** said: *无* means *not*—that the ruler does not rectify himself, and thus there is no state.

**Páng** said: Who knows the ultimate of good governance? Only the *dim* can be held up—no fixed principle, no named law—yet the world transforms naturally. This is its ultimate.

**Páng** said: The great flow does not halt. What is timely is right; to fix the proper and strange, yet not know that the proper cannot be constant—can this be called wisdom?

Though it is said that *dim* is proper, it is proper by being *not-proper*.

*邪* is an uncertain term, also not fixed in *dim*.

**The proper becomes strange.**

**He** said: *奇* means *deceit*—when the ruler is not proper, even if the people are, they in turn deceive above.

**Bi** said: If governance upholds the proper, it will soon resort to the strange in warfare—thus the proper becomes strange.

**The good becomes anomalous.**

**The Emperor-Sage** said: At the extremes of disaster and fortune, is there no proper or strange? Yet beings cling to delusion, calling the proper *deceit* and the good *anomalous*—thus disaster and fortune alternate, as though there were no proper way.

**He** said: Even the virtuous transform above into anomalous omens.

**Bi** said: When goodness is established to harmonize the people, anomalous flattery soon arises—this is the peril of the anomalous.

**The age of delusion is long.**

**The Emperor-Sage** said: To call the proper *strange* and the good *anomalous*—such delusion has endured for long.

**He** said: The ruler’s delusion and loss of the proper have lasted long.

**Bi** said: The people’s delusion and abandonment of the Way have endured for long—do not hastily demand proper governance.

**Páng** said: The people have lost their nature yet remain unaware. Since the Way’s emergence, it has been thus—not the work of a single day. Yet rulers now pursue *察察* governance, yet seek to force the world into their one-sided properness. This is impossible, and they do not even know what they call *proper*—for they have never truly rectified.

The Sage acts differently: though square and straight, his virtue shines like the sun, yet his form remains naturally blended, not forcing a path upon the people. Thus the people rest, return to simplicity, and customs grow pure—how could this be mere minor correction?

Thus the Sage is square yet does not cut—

**He** said: The Sage practices rectitude to guide the people, not to sever them.

**Pì** said: Guide things with rectitude, yet abandon their perversity—do not sever things with rectitude. This is what is meant by *"the great square has no corners."*

**Páng** said: *"The great square has no corners"*—this speaks of blending naturally. If there is a path of sharp division, then boundaries are set between things.

**Lián** yet not **jù**—[The *Míng Huáng* and *Wáng Bì* manuscripts corrupt this as *jù* (harsh).]

**Hé** said: The Sage’s virtue is serene and clear, seeking to transform the people, not to harm them. Now it is otherwise: one rectifies oneself to harm others.

**Pì** said: *Kāng* (serene)—this is *qīng kāng* (clear and serene). *Chuàng* (injury)—this is harm. To use clear serenity to purify the people, removing their filth, yet not to inflict injury upon things with this clear serenity.

**Páng** said: Though there may be corners of serenity, they do not reach the point of harshness. [One manuscript corrupts *jù* (harsh) as *huì* (filthy)—this is incorrect.]

**Zhí** yet not **sì**—

**Hé** said: *Sì* (excess)—this is *shēn* (to press). The Sage, though straight, bends himself to follow others, not pressing his own views.

**Pì** said: Guide things with straightness, ordering them to abandon their eccentricities, yet do not provoke turmoil in things with this straightness—this is what is meant by *"the greatest straightness seems to bend."*

**Páng** said: Straightness that presses is merely straightness; the greatest straightness, in accordance with principle, is always yielding and conforming to principle.

**Guāng** yet not **yào**—

**Míng Huáng** said: The Sage excels in transformation, not carving boundaries to make them square, not inflicting injury to make them sharp, not pressing others to make them straight, not dazzling others to make them bright. Cultivate within oneself, and the world transforms naturally.

*Sì* (excess)—this is *shēn* (to press).

**Hé** said: Though the Sage possesses solitary wisdom, he remains as if in darkness, not dazzling others to disrupt them.

**Pì** said: Use light to reveal their confusion, yet do not shine light to seek out their hidden faults—this is what is meant by *"the bright Way seems dim."*

All these are to exalt the root and thus still the branches, not attacking yet causing return.

**Páng** said: Light that dazzles things is called *yào* (dazzling). To harmonize the light and return to its clarity—how could this be dazzling to blind things?

**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing People and Serving Heaven**

**Governing people**—

**Hé** said: This refers to the sovereign governing the people.

**Serving Heaven**—

**Hé** said: *Shì* (serve)—this means *yòng* (to apply). One should apply the Way of Heaven, following the four seasons.

**No better than *shè* (frugality).**

**Míng Huáng** said: Pronounced *ài* (love). When the sovereign seeks to govern people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality. Fill the granaries, let the people know propriety, and let the three seasons not be harmed—then Heaven will bestow auspicious omens. Harmony among the people suffices to govern them; Heaven’s preservation suffices to serve Heaven.

**Hé** said: *Shè*—this is *shí* (food). Those who govern the state should love the people’s resources, not indulging in extravagance. Those who cultivate themselves should cherish their vital essence, not dissipating it.

**Pì** said: *Mò ruò*—this means "nothing exceeds." *Shè*—the farmer’s method of tending the fields, striving to eliminate distinctions and return to uniformity. Preserve their natural state, not hastening their decay or disease, removing what causes decay and disease. Above, it aligns with Heaven’s mandate; below, it soothes the common people—nothing exceeds this.

**Páng** said: Governing people lies in rectifying oneself; serving Heaven lies in fulfilling one’s nature. These two are unified in *shè* (frugality) alone. Preserve one’s vital spirit, not wasting it externally or internally—this is frugality. Humanity’s original nature fills the six extremes, yet ultimately becomes insufficient—this is due to excess and reckless self-indulgence. Only frugality can preserve what Heaven has bestowed, not squandering it on vain pursuits. Then, is there any failing to fulfill one’s nature? Any failing to rectify oneself?

Mencius said: *"Exhaust your mind, know your nature—this is how one serves Heaven."* Indeed, preserving what was originally commanded ensures Heaven’s will is fulfilled. People share with me what they have received—if I truly preserve it, those who share it will respond accordingly. Then, what difficulty is there in governance?

Only frugality thus brings early return.

**Míng Huáng** said: How does one gather the people? It is through wealth—thus, if one is frugal and loving, the people from all directions will come bearing offerings, serving their sovereign early.

*Fú*—this means *shì* (to serve).

**Hé** said: *Zǎo*—this is *xiān* (early). *Fú*—this is *dé* (virtue). If one alone loves the people’s resources and cherishes vital essence, then one can first attain the Way of Heaven.

**Pì** said: *Fù*—this is *cháng* (constant).

**Páng** said: When movement reaches its extreme and becomes still, then its return is late. Only frugality, not indulging in self-expenditure, never strays far from its root—thus its return to stillness is early. [One manuscript corrupts *fù* (return) as *fú* (serve)—this is incorrect.] Early return is called *heavy accumulation of virtue.*

**Míng Huáng** said: Those who practice frugality thereby possess virtue, and the people, drawn to virtue, serve their sovereign early—hence, *"heavy accumulation of virtue."*

**Hé** said: Light attaining the Great Way is called *"heavy accumulation of virtue within oneself."*

**Pì** said: Only by heavy accumulation of virtue, not desiring swiftness, can one then cause early return to constancy—thus, *"early return is called heavy accumulation of virtue."*

**Páng** said: Virtue not wasted externally accumulates within. Accumulated within, its resources are inexhaustible—this accumulation is accumulation upon accumulation. Heavy accumulation of virtue thus conquers all.

**Míng Huáng** said: The Sage accumulates virtue, and the four seas return to ren—then there is nothing he cannot subdue.

*Kè*—this means *néng* (ability).

**Hé** said: *Kè*—this is *shèng* (to overcome). Heavy accumulation of virtue within oneself means overcoming all.

**Páng** said: Those who exhaust their nature will give birth to Heaven and Earth, govern creation and transformation—what cannot they accomplish? If there is nothing they cannot overcome, then none know their limits.

**Míng Huáng** said: The sovereign’s virtue knows no limits in governance—thus, none from afar know its extent.

**Hé** said: If there is nothing one cannot overcome, then none know the limits of one’s virtue.

**Bì** said: The Dao is boundless.

**Páng** said: To exhaust one’s nature is great indeed. Greatness in transformation makes one a Sage. Transformation is boundless—thus, none know its limits.

None knowing its limits is the way of having a realm.

**Míng Huáng** said: Only when none know its limits can one truly have a realm.

**Hé** said: If none know the limits of one’s virtue, then one can establish a state and bring blessings to the people.

**Bì** said: To claim a realm with finite limits is not to truly have a realm.

**Páng** said: The Sage refines coarse and pure alike—enough to mold Yao and Shun. What is there to having a realm?

The mother of having a realm is what makes it enduring.

**Míng Huáng** said: If one governs a realm and nourishes the people well, then its blessings and lineage shall endure.

**Hé** said: The realm and the body are one. The mother is the Dao. If one preserves the Dao within, letting qi not labor and the five spirits not suffer, then endurance is possible.

**Bì** said: The reason a realm is secure is called its mother. To accumulate virtue heavily is to focus on its roots—only then does one tend to the branches and achieve its end.

**Páng** said: The mother of having a realm is what makes one have a realm—none know its limits. This is called deep roots and firm foundations.

**Hé** said: If one takes qi as root and essence as the calyx, then as a tree’s roots are not deep, its calyx is not firm and it falls. One must deeply conceal the qi and firmly guard the essence, ensuring no leakage.

**Páng** said: Nature and life are the root; beyond this are branches and leaves. Those who lose their nature flourish in branches and leaves to harm the root. When the root is injured, essence and qi decline, and the calyx is not firm—this is why they die young.

Only when one does not harm the root from without does the root deepen, the calyx firm, and the form bind to life, delaying separation. *Zhì* (calyx), in one text *tí* (calyx)—sound and meaning are the same.

This is the Dao of longevity and enduring vision.

**Míng Huáng** said: Accumulating virtue to have a realm makes roots deep and calyx firm. The deeply firm is the Dao of longevity and enduring vision.

**Hé** said: Those with deep roots and firm calyx are on the path of longevity and enduring vision.

**Páng** said: Spirit manifests in the eyes, so when a person dies, the eyes grow dim and lose their light. If one conserves deeply, the calyx is firm, and the roots deep—thus, vision endures long.

**Chapter Sixty: Governing a Great Realm as Cooking Fresh Delicacies**

**Míng Huáng** said: When cooking fresh delicacies, one must not disturb them. When governing a great realm, one must not weary the people. To weary them is to exhaust the people; to disturb them is to spoil the fish.

**Hé** said: *Xian* (fresh) refers to fish. When cooking small fish, one does not remove the intestines or scales, nor dare one disturb it, for fear it will disintegrate. To weary the people in governing the realm brings chaos below; to weary oneself in cultivating the body scatters the spirit.

**Bì** said: It means not to agitate. Agitation brings many harms; stillness preserves the true. Thus, the greater the realm, the more still its ruler must be, only then can one broadly win the hearts of the people.

**Páng** said: In cooking fresh delicacies, one only waits for them to cook naturally, applying no artificial skill—if stirred and disturbed, they will spoil. The Dao of governing a realm is the same: though the realm be vast as the world, if one follows the Way, it is very easy to govern. Those who wield the Way over the world make their spirits unmanifest. **Míng Huáng** said: When one governs the world with the Way, seeking no false blessings, thus the spirits have no means to display their marvels and harm people.

**Hé** said: When one governs the world with virtue and the Dao, the spirits dare not manifest their spirits to harm people.

**Bì** said: When governing a great realm, it is like cooking fresh delicacies; when applying the Way to the world, its spirits are unmanifest.

**Páng** said: If the people are undisturbed, they may fully manifest their nature. When the people manifest their nature, the harmony of Heaven and Earth responds, and all things flourish without obstruction. Thus, the spirits also rest in their place and cannot manifest as marvels. Though human and spirit follow different paths, when their interactions become entangled, the *qi* of yin and yang becomes disordered, and their proper places are lost—thus, all things gain opportunity to exploit the chaos. It is not that the spirits lack marvels, nor that their marvels harm people. **Míng Huáng** said: Earlier, it was said that the spirits are unmanifest—not that their marvels are extinguished, but that their marvels do not appear to harm people.

**Hé** said: The spirits are not without spirit—evil cannot enter the upright, and thus they cannot harm the natural people.

**Bì** said: The marvels do not harm the natural. Things abide in their nature, and the marvels have nothing to add; when the marvels have nothing to add, one does not know the marvels as marvels. It is not that the marvels do not harm people, nor that the Sage does not harm people. **Míng Huáng** said: When spirits manifest marvels, they harm people; when the Sage acts, they harm people. Now, the reason the spirits do not manifest marvels to harm people is that the Sage acts with non-action and stillness.

**Hé** said: It is not that the spirits and marvels cannot harm people—when the Sage is in power and does not harm people, the spirits dare not interfere.

**Bì** said: When the Way is pervasive, the marvels do not harm people; when the marvels do not harm people, one does not know the marvels as marvels. When the Way is pervasive, the Sage also does not harm people; when the Sage does not harm people, one also does not know the Sage as Sage. It is as if one does not know the marvels as marvels, nor the Sage as Sage. Those who rely on coercive laws to control things are signs of declining governance. When one does not know the marvels and the Sage as such, this is the ultimate of the Way.

**Páng** said: Only the Sage does not harm people, thus the harmony of Heaven and Earth responds, and people and spirits each flourish without mutual harm. The two do not harm each other—**Hé** said: The spirits and the Sage, both do not harm each other—thus virtue returns and is reciprocated. **Míng Huáng** said: When spirits and marvels harm people, the realm suffers loss and its foundations weaken; when the Sage harms people, the spirit is depleted and sacrifices fail. Now, since neither harms the other, virtue returns and is reciprocated.

**Hé** said: When the two do not harm each other, the people are governed in the yang, the spirits in the yin; the people preserve their life and nature, the spirits preserve their spirit—thus virtue returns and is reciprocated.

**Bì** said: The marvels do not harm people, nor does the Sage harm people; the Sage does not harm people, nor do the marvels harm people—thus it is said the two do not harm each other. The marvels and the Sage unite in the Way and return virtue.

**Páng** said: The people return virtue to the spirits; the spirits return virtue to the people. *(End of Volume Eight of the* Dao De Jing *with Annotations by Míng Huáng, Hé, Wáng Bì, and Wáng Páng.)*

**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great State as the Downstream**

**The Great State as the Downstream**
The great state is the downstream.
**Hé** said: Governing a great state should be like residing in the downstream—never opposing the subtle currents.
**Bì** said: The rivers and seas dwell great yet low, and thus all streams flow to them. The great state dwells great yet low, and thus all under Heaven flows to it. Hence it is said, *"The great state is the downstream."*

**Páng** said: Like the rivers and seas to all the valleys. The confluence of all under Heaven.
**Míng Huáng** said: The downstream is the virtue of humility. The great state, if it opens itself in humility, will attract all under Heaven.

**Hé** said: The great state is where the scholars and commoners of all under Heaven gather.
**Bì** said: The place where all under Heaven converges.
**The Feminine of All Under Heaven**
**Hé** said: The feminine is of the yin category—soft, humble, harmonious, and unaggrieved.
**Bì** said: Quiet yet unseeking, and things return to it of their own accord.
**Páng** said: One should receive things with the stillness of the feminine. *(Original text: "One root: 'the confluence of all under Heaven'")*

**The Feminine Always Overcomes the Masculine Through Stillness**
**Hé** said: The female submits to the male, yet yin overcomes yang through tranquility, seeking first to be low.
**The Stillness as the Low**
**Míng Huáng** said: When the people of all under Heaven converge through humility, it is like the feminine’s stillness—always sought by the masculine’s agitation, hence stillness as the low.

**Hé** said: The Dao of yin takes tranquility as humility.
**Bì** said: Because of its stillness, it can be low.
The feminine is the receptive; the masculine is impulsive and desiring. The receptive always remains still, thus overcoming the impulsive. Because of its stillness, it can be low, and thus things return to it.
**Páng** said: *(Original text: "One root: 'because of its stillness, it is low'")*

**Thus the Great State Subdues the Small State**
**Bì** said: *"The great state subdues"* means the great state, in being low, takes the small state.
**Hé** said: If it can humble itself, it will always possess it.
**Bì** said: The small state attaches itself to it.
The small state subdues the great state, then takes the great state.
**Míng Huáng** said: The great takes the small as subjects; the small takes the great as allies.

**Hé** said: This means that states, whether great or small, if they practice humility and nurture others, will have no faults.
**Bì** said: The great state receives them.
Thus, sometimes it is low to take, sometimes it is low while taking.
**Míng Huáng** said: *"To take"* refers to the great taking the small. *"While taking"* refers to the small taking the great.
**Hé** said: *"The low"* means the great state is low to the small state, the small state is low to the great state, and they take each other through righteousness.
**Bì** said: It speaks only of cultivating lowliness, then each obtains what it should.
**Páng** said: By nature, one does not seek to subdue others; if one acts kindly, it is not to take others, but by nature, one is low to others, and others naturally return to it.

**The Great State Does Not Seek to Overwhelm Others**
The great state does not seek to overwhelm others; the small state does not seek to serve others.
**Míng Huáng** said: The great state, in humbling itself to the small state, does not seek to overwhelm them as subjects. The small state, in offering tribute and submission to the great state, does not seek to serve it as an ally.

**Hé** said: To make them subjects and servants.
Both thus obtain what they desire, hence the great should be low.

**Míng Huáng** said: One seeks subjects, the other seeks allies—both obtain what they desire. Yet the great state must always guard against fullness, hence it is said the great should be low.
**Hé** said: The great and small states each seek what they desire; the great state should especially practice humility.
**Bì** said: The small state cultivates lowliness only to preserve itself and cannot make all under Heaven return to it. The great state cultivates lowliness, and all under Heaven returns to it. Hence it is said, *"each obtains what it desires, thus the great should be low."*

**Páng** said: *(Original text: "Balanced in taking: the great state is low to the small state, which is the Dao of joying in Heaven. The small state is low to the great state, which is the Dao of fearing Heaven. Joy and fear of Heaven are matters of power. The Dao is the mystery of all things.")*

**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Mystery of All Things**

**The Dao as the Mystery of All Things**
The Dao is the mystery of all things.
**Míng Huáng** said: All things draw upon the wondrous origin to take form—this is where all things derive their sustenance, hence it is said to be the mystery. *(Mystery: inner essence.)*
**Hé** said: Mystery means "to conceal." The Dao conceals all things, containing all without exception.
**Bì** said: Mystery is like "love"—a term for what can shelter and shade.
**Páng** said: The Great Dao is profound and secret, able to shelter all things and where all things are hidden.

**The Treasure of the Virtuous**
**Míng Huáng** said: The virtuous know that those who uphold the Dao flourish, while those who lose it perish, hence they always treasure it without neglect.
**Hé** said: The virtuous take the Dao as their personal treasure, daring not to defy it.
**Bì** said: Treasure is for use.
**Páng** said: The treasure of the virtuous—what the Sage embodies. *(Original text: "One version: 'the treasure of the virtuous'")*

**The Preservation of the Unvirtuous**
**Míng Huáng** said: Preservation means "to rely upon." The unvirtuous, unable to treasure the Dao, when facing ruin, seek to rely upon it for self-preservation.
**Hé** said: The Dao is what the unvirtuous rely upon in times of crisis. Even then, they know to repent and humble themselves.
**Bì** said: Preservation is for survival.

**Fine Words Can Be Bartered**
**Hé** said: Fine words are only fit for the marketplace—once the exchange is done, they depart, and no further pleasantries are exchanged. Buyers seek swift purchase, sellers swift sale.

**Noble Conduct Can Be Bestowed Upon Others**
**Míng Huáng** said: Sweetening one’s speech can win barter; elevating one’s conduct can influence others. This illustrates the Sage: with sweet and lawful speech, and noble, tranquil conduct, transforming the unvirtuous—just as merchants sell goods, leading others to follow virtue.

Thus it follows that the lower text states:

**Hé** said: *Jiā* (加), means to distinguish.
When a person possesses noble and distinguished conduct, they can be set apart from the common folk, yet this alone is not enough to honor the Dao.

**Bì** said: The Dao precedes all speech, and nothing is more precious than this.
Even with treasures of jade and fine horses, they cannot uphold the Dao.
Sweet words can sway the market’s value, thus it is said: *Fine words can be bartered*.
Noble conduct can draw response even from afar, thus it is said: *Noble conduct can be bestowed upon others*.

**Pān** said: *Fine words and noble conduct* are the lesser currents of the Dao, yet they still suffice to barter and bestow upon others—how much more so for those who embody the Dao itself!
(One text omits the character *yú* (於).)

Why should the unvirtuous be abandoned?
**Míng Huáng** said: The unvirtuous are not to be abandoned; they too must be transformed. Why should they be cast aside?

**Hé** said: Though people may be unvirtuous, they should be transformed by the Dao. Before the Three Sovereigns (三皇), was there ever abandonment of the people? The virtue of their transformation was pure and simple.

**Bì** said: The unvirtuous must rely upon the Dao to avoid imitation.

**Pān** said: The marketplace unites through mutual benefit, but human nature resents those above them and cannot be bestowed upon.
If one has sweet words and noble conduct, even those driven by profit may engage with them, and noble conduct can be bestowed without resentment.
Thus, those who embody the Dao—when transforming others, what can they not subdue?
Hence, the unvirtuous are not abandoned.

Therefore, the Sage establishes the Son of Heaven and appoints the Three Ministers:
**Míng Huáng** said: To teach the unvirtuous.

**Hé** said: To make the teaching of the unvirtuous possible.

**Bì** said: To speak of honoring noble conduct and the Dao.
Even with a jade tablet held high and four horses leading the way, it is better to sit and present this Dao.
**Míng Huáng** said: Though the Three Ministers assist with jade tablets and four horses, even if they come in silence, it is still not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao of *Wuwei* (無為) to me, so that I may transform others.

**Hé** said: Though jade tablets and four horses come first, it is still not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.

**Bì** said: This is what was spoken of earlier—establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers, honoring their rank, valuing their persons, all for the sake of the Dao. Nothing is more precious than this, so even if jade tablets are held high and four horses lead the way, it is still not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.

**Pān** said: The Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers take transforming the people as their duty. If the Dao is practiced, the people will naturally come to reverence. Jade tablets and horses are used to attract the worthy, and attracting the worthy is the greatest of governance. Though the worthy are obtained, if the Dao cannot be presented, the people will still not submit. Thus, it is better not to seek externally but to present the essence of the Dao.

Why is this Dao held in such esteem in antiquity?
**Míng Huáng** said: *Why?* is an interrogative phrase.
Does it mean *seeking to obtain*?
**Hé** said: In antiquity, this Dao was held in esteem because one did not need to travel far to seek it—it could be found within oneself.

Does it mean *using guilt to be pardoned*?
**Hé** said: *Guilt* refers to those in turbulent times under tyrannical rulers, who suffer unjust punishment. Cultivating the Dao can dissolve death, freeing one from all calamities.

**Pān** said: *Seeking to obtain* is why the virtuous cherish it; *using guilt to be pardoned* is why the unvirtuous rely upon it.
Thus, it is held in esteem throughout the world.

**Míng Huáng** said: The Dao lies in awakening, not in seeking. It is not like wealth, which can be sought daily and obtained. Thus it is said: *Not daily seeking to obtain*.
Once awakened, there is no guilt to burden oneself—why wait for guilt to arise before seeking pardon?
It is thus held in esteem throughout the world.

**Hé** said: The virtue of the Dao is vast and profound, encompassing all without exception. It preserves the body and governs the state, tranquil and effortless, thus it can be held in esteem throughout the world.

**Bì** said: Seeking brings obtaining; seeking pardon brings freedom. It applies to all without fail, thus it is held in esteem throughout the world.

**Chapter Sixty-Three: On *Wuwei* (無為)**
On *Wuwei* (無為)...

**Chapter Sixty-Three: On *Wuwei* (無為) — Continued**

**Hé** said: Follow completion to cultivate—thus there is no artificial contrivance.
**Páng** said: This is the Dao in action.

*Wuwei* in affairs—doing nothing in action.
**Hé** said: Prepare beforehand to eliminate troubles and simplify matters.
**Páng** said: This is the Dao in practice.

*Wuwei* in taste—flavorless flavor.
**Hé** said: Deep contemplation and foresight—this is savoring the Dao’s intent.
**Bì** said: To dwell in *wuwei*, to teach through silence, to find serenity in simplicity—this is the pinnacle of governance.
**Páng** said: This is savoring the Dao. These three matters—*wuwei*, *wuwei* in action, and *wuwei* in taste—are the constants of the Dao. Though one practices *wuwei* as a constant, one does not dare neglect it, thus light as it is toward all things, yet when encountering things with the Dao, and reaching toward things, one does not dare be negligent. Hence it is said below:

Great and small, much and little—
**Hé** said: This is setting forth warnings and prohibitions.
Desiring greatness, one returns to smallness; desiring much, one returns to little—this is the natural Way.
**Páng** said: To fear small matters as great, to regard few things as many—*Zhuangzi* says: *"Do not overlook others."*

Repaying enmity with virtue.
**Míng Huáng** said: In *wuwei*, in doing nothing in action, in savoring nothing in taste—if greatness and smallness, much and little, do not exceed their proper measure, then there will be none to harbor enmity. When desires arise from circumstances and transgressions harm nature, then neither great nor small shall escape the retribution of enmity. Now, having preserved one’s measure and maintained harmony, thus one repays enmity with virtue.
**Hé** said: Cultivating the Dao and doing good—this cuts off misfortune before it arises.
**Bì** said: A small enmity is insufficient to repay a great one; thus what the world desires to punish, what aligns with universal accord, is virtue.
**Yú** said: To repay enmity with justice is mere action. To repay enmity with virtue is virtue itself. Action shares in fortune and calamity with the people, hence all the above methods—none may be omitted. But virtue transcends all things; how could enmity arise? These three matters above are the embodiment of the Dao. When one embodies the Dao, thus it must be so.

Raise enmity and repay with virtue—then one knows virtue is never unused.

Plan for difficulty when it is easy—
**Hé** said: To harmonize with great difficulties, one must act when they are still easy, before they take form.
To achieve greatness when it is yet small—
**Míng Huáng** said: Those who indulge their passions and desires find nothing easy, nothing small—now, to plan for their great difficulties and undertake their vast enterprises, one must act when nature is undispersed and measure is untransgressed—that is, when things are still easy and small.
**Hé** said: To accomplish great deeds, one must begin with small ones—for calamity arises from the small.
**Yú** said: Though one who relies on virtue practices *wuwei* as a constant, yet when encountering affairs and things, one must always be vigilant and prepared, as the *Classic of Documents* says: *"Diligently, diligently—day and night, myriad affairs."* *Zhuangzi* says: *"To have and yet make it easy—Heaven does not approve. The world’s calamities often arise from what is overlooked. Be wary of what is easy and what is small, then there will never be blame."*

The world’s great difficulties must begin in what is easy—
**Hé** said: Difficulty arises from ease.
The world’s great enterprises must begin in what is small—
**Míng Huáng** said: This clarifies the earlier point about preemptive planning.
**Hé** said: From smallness to manifestation.
**Páng** said: What is easy emerges from what is overlooked; what is small grows from the subtle to the manifest.

Thus the Sage never pursues what is great—
**Hé** said: This is dwelling in humility.
And so is able to achieve what is great.
**Míng Huáng** said: Having said that great enterprises must begin in smallness, this explains how the Sage can achieve greatness—by not pursuing what is difficult or vast, thus attaining true grandeur.
**Hé** said: This is why the world reverts to them.
**Páng** said: The Sage constantly attends to small matters to accomplish great deeds. Once the work is done, this is what is called the Great Person. The *Odes* say: *"If small difficulties are neglected, the Central States will decline."* This also illustrates how great governance lies in the accumulation of small things.

Heedless promises bring few truths—
**Hé** said: This is not taking words lightly.
Too many easy actions bring many difficulties—
**Míng Huáng** said: Light promises to others will lead to few truths; frequent ease in action will inevitably bring many difficulties.
**Hé** said: This is not being cautious in one’s breath.
Thus even the Sage finds it difficult—
**Hé** said: The Sage, in all actions and undertakings, still weighs progress and retreat with difficulty, seeking to stem their source.
**Bì** said: Even with the Sage’s talent, they still find difficulty in what is small and easy—how much more so for those without such virtue? Thus it is said: *"Even the Sage finds it difficult."*
Thus there will never be difficulty.
**Míng Huáng** said: Difficulty arises from light promises and ease in action, hence there will never be great difficulty.
**Hé** said: The Sage, throughout their life, avoids what is difficult, yet still shuns harm deeply.
**Páng** said: The Sage does not merely guard against the subtle to avoid creating trouble—they always regard action with caution and never act lightly. Thus there will never be difficulty.

**Chapter Sixty-Four: On *Its An-Ease-Holding* (其安易持)**

Its ease in holding—
**Hé** said: Governing the body and the state—what is tranquil is easy to uphold.

Its premonitory signs are easy to plan for—
**Míng Huáng** said: When one’s nature is upright and tranquil, and one wishes to grasp and hold it, lest it scatter—even if desires have not yet taken form, one plans to cut them off, making them not arise. This is very easy.

**Hé** said: Emotions, desires, and calamities—when their signs have not yet manifested, they are easy to forestall.
**Páng** said: Vigilance must come before matters arise—*"To act before there is anything to act upon."*

Its fragility is easy to dispel—
**Hé** said: Calamities have not yet stirred in the court; desires have not yet shown in expression—like something fragile, easy to break apart.
**Páng** said: *"Fragile"* is here used in place of *"breakable."*

Its subtlety is easy to disperse—
**Míng Huáng** said: When desire first takes root, it is still perilous and fragile—those who cut it off find it easy to break.

「When calamities first arise, their signs are still subtle—if one wishes to prevent them, their subtlety makes them easy to disperse.

**Hé** said: When their signs have not yet manifested, they are still small and easy to disperse.

**Bì** said: Though one may fail to act, there is no harm; because of their subtlety and fragility, they are not yet sufficient to provoke great consequences—this is why they are easy to address.

These four teachings all speak of *cautious completion* (慎终). One must not abandon them because there is no harm yet, nor neglect to disperse them because they are subtle. If there is no harm yet but one does not hold to caution, harm will arise. If they are subtle but not dispersed, great harm will follow. Therefore, considering the potential harm at its end, as one would the beginning of a calamity, ensures no failure in affairs.

**Páng** said: *"To act before there is anything to act upon"* (为之於未有) and *"to treat before chaos arises"* (治於未乱).

**Míng Huáng** said: *"Covering above"* (覆上) is easy to grasp and easy to plan—this is why it is easy, for one acts before the signs and forms have manifested.

**Hé** said: If one wishes to take action, it must be done when the signs have not yet sprouted—one should block the source.

**Bì** said: This means to secure what is still tranquil and unmanifested.

*"To treat before chaos arises"* (治之於未乱).

**Míng Huáng** said: *"Covering above"* (覆上) is easy to break and easy to disperse—this is why it is easy, for one removes the disorder before it has fully formed into calamity.

**Hé** said: In governing oneself and the state, when chaos has not yet arisen, one must seal and close its gates.

**Bì** said: This means to block what is subtle and fragile.

A tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout.
**Hé** said: From small to great.
**Páng** said: Growth.

A nine-tiered tower begins with piled soil.
**Hé** said: From low to high.
**Páng** said: Accumulation.

A thousand-li journey starts beneath one’s feet.
**Míng Huáng** said: These two teachings illustrate how one must not delay in planning well, lest later harm arise.

**Hé** said: From near to far.

**Páng** said: Progress.

These three teachings all describe the principle of *transformation* (物化), from near to far, from subtle to manifest. Therefore, the Sage does not dare to provoke the beginnings of things, lest they grow and spread, for fear that they will later become great and distant, leaving ruin for posterity.

Hence it is said: *"If you act upon what has already transformed, I shall suppress it with the nameless simplicity."* Then the Sage’s foresight is indeed early.

Those who act upon things bring about their ruin.
**Hé** said: To act upon affairs is to ruin spontaneity; to act upon righteousness is to ruin benevolence; to act upon form is to ruin vitality and spirit.

Those who cling to things lose them.
**Míng Huáng** said: Ordinary emotions cannot follow their natural course; artificial schemes are external. Those who act seek fulfillment, but their very schemes bring ruin. In affairs, one cannot abandon and forget them—every movement creates attachment. Attachment seeks possession, but its very nature brings loss.

**Hé** said: Clinging to advantage invites ruin; clinging to the Dao preserves life. Insisting on what one cannot hold, while yielding and letting go returns to its source.

**Bì** said: One should use *cautious completion* to remove what is subtle, and vigilance over what is subtle to prevent chaos. Yet if one acts upon it and clings to it, the origins of affairs will only multiply, and clever scheming will breed further complications—this is why ruin and loss occur.

**Páng** said: The True Constant (真常) has no form. If one imposes form upon it, one violates its nature. To act and to cling are both acts of the will—if I have this will, then the people’s desires will grow daily. How can this be called *"securing tranquility and planning before signs manifest"*? Therefore, the Sage acts without acting, and thus there is no ruin.

**Hé** said: The Sage does not value ostentatious words, nor does he pursue superficial gains or violent conquests—thus there is no ruin or loss.

Without clinging, there is no loss.
**Hé** said: The Sage possesses virtue to teach the ignorant and wealth to aid the poor, holding nothing back for himself—thus he loses nothing to others.

**Páng** said: If I do not ruin the True Constant nor lose my inherent nature, then the world will also be complete. This is its inherent nature.

Therefore, when the people engage in affairs, they often bring ruin upon themselves when success is nearly achieved.
**Míng Huáng** said: Those who begin with good intentions often ruin their own progress when success is near.

**Hé** said: *"From"* (从) means *"to act"* (为).

When the people act upon affairs, they often, when their merits are nearly complete, become greedy for position and reputation, indulgent in luxury, and filled with arrogance—thus they ruin themselves.

**Bì** said: They lack *cautious completion*.

**Páng** said: Affairs have their natural course; when the time comes, they will be complete. *Zhuangzi* says: *"The beauty of completion lies in its duration."* Yet the people are foolish and unaware, ignorant of this principle. They are hasty and seek speed, aiding human efforts against the natural order—thus, when affairs are nearly complete, they often meet ruin. This is the fault of letting humans overcome nature, of letting affairs overcome the Dao.

If one is *cautious in completion as in the beginning*, then there will be no ruined affairs.

**Míng Huáng** said: If one is vigilant in its final stages, always maintaining the original intention of doing good, then there will certainly be no overstepping or ruin.

**Hé** said: The end should be like the beginning—one must not slacken.

**Páng** said: Affairs naturally unfold on their own; they do not rely on external force. Like planting seeds, one only needs to deepen their roots and remove their harm—then, when autumn comes, they will flourish. Their completion can be awaited.

Therefore, the Sage desires what others do not desire.
**Hé** said: The Sage desires what others do not desire—when people’s desires are manifest, the Sage desires to conceal their brilliance; when people seek adornment, the Sage desires simplicity; when people crave form, the Sage desires virtue.

**Páng** said: *"Desiring what is not desired"* is not the absence of desire—desire lies in not desiring it. Therefore, one does not value treasures that are difficult to obtain.

Not valuing treasures that are difficult to obtain—
**Míng Huáng** said: Treasures that are difficult to obtain are those beyond one’s inherent nature. Now, the Sage, in desiring what is not desired, does not scheme for what lies outside his nature—thus he always preserves his natural state. This is not valuing treasures that are difficult to obtain.

**Hé** said: The Sage is not dazzled by artificial adornment, nor does he devalue stones while esteeming jade.

**Bì** said: Though desires may be subtle, competition and striving will arise from them; though treasures that are difficult to obtain may be minor, their value will provoke theft.

**Páng** said: The Sage’s principle of *"no action, no clinging"* means he does not yet reach the stage of complete abandonment and forgetfulness—only that he does not scheme beyond his inherent nature, generating further desires. Moreover, when the people have food to eat and warm clothing, these are necessities of their nature, which they cannot avoid. They desire no more than this, and thus they do not have further desires.»

「Yet after abandoning inherent nature, further valuing treasures that are difficult to obtain—this is the folly of the ignorant, straying far from their original foundation.

Thus, the Sage *wishes yet does not wish*, using this to awaken their confusion and return them to their inherent nature. He *learns yet does not learn*—

**Hé** said: The Sage learns what ordinary people cannot learn. Ordinary people learn cleverness and deceit; the Sage learns natural spontaneity. Ordinary people learn to govern the world; the Sage learns to govern himself, safeguarding the true Dao.

**Páng** said: *Learning yet not learning* is not the absence of learning—rather, what is learned lies in *not learning*, to rectify the excesses of the multitude. To rectify the excesses of the multitude—

**Hé** said: The multitude’s pursuit of learning is inverted; their errors treat the root as a branch and reality as mere ornamentation. To rectify this is to return them to their root.

**Bì** said: Those who are skilled without learning are guided by natural spontaneity. This is a caution against the errors of those who do not learn. Thus, *learning yet not learning* is to rectify the excesses of the multitude.

**Páng** said: The multitude chases superficiality and multiplies affairs, while the Sage, through *learning yet not learning*, seizes their errors and returns them to the Dao. To aid the natural spontaneity of all things—

**Hé** said: Teaching people to return to true roots is to assist all things in fulfilling their natural spontaneity, yet he does not dare to act.

**Míng Huáng** said: The Sage does not seek learning beyond his inherent nature—this is *learning yet not learning*, intending to restore the multitude’s excessive learning and assist their natural spontaneity. Thus, he does not dare to engage in vulgar learning or excessive desires.

**Páng** said: Aiding natural spontaneity is what *Zhuāngzi* calls *"returning to align with Heaven"*—to act otherwise would extinguish human nature in favor of Heaven’s. Thus, he does not dare to act.

Then, all things rest in the constancy of their **性命** (*xìngmìng*), and affairs reveal no traces of deviation. How could there exist anything fragile enough to float away or subtle enough to disperse?」

「Hé said: "Discussing the ancient **Dao**-adept, one who governs himself with the **Dao** and extends this to governing the realm. He does not do so to enlighten the people, but rather—

Hé said: "He does not teach the people with his **Dao**, for that would merely reveal their cunning and cleverness. Instead, he seeks to make them simple.

**Míng Huáng** said: "A ruler skilled in the **Dao** does not openly display his **Dao** to the people, but rather guides them with harmony, leading them back to their **pǔ** (primordial simplicity), making them like the unknowing.

○ Hé said: "He teaches the people with **virtue** and **power** (*déyuè*), so that their **pǔ** (primordial simplicity) remains uncorrupted by deceit and falsehood.

○ Bì said: "‘Enlighten’ refers to their many knowledges obscuring their **pǔ** (primordial simplicity), while ‘make them simple’ means they lack knowledge yet uphold truth, relying on natural spontaneity.

○ Páng said: "What he hates in the ‘simple’ is not ignorance—those who do not understand yet defy laws and prohibitions—but rather, he opposes those who deviate from the **pǔ** (primordial simplicity), indulging in cleverness and deceit. The *Shījīng* (*Book of Poetry*) says: ‘Unknowing yet unknowing, following the norms of constancy.’ The difficulty in governing the people lies in their excessive cleverness.

**Míng Huáng** said: "When a ruler governs by enlightenment, the people must exert their cleverness to respond to him. If cleverness is excessive, deceit arises, making governance difficult.

○ Hé said: "Because of their excessive cleverness, they resort to deceit and falsehood.

○ Bì said: "Excessive cleverness and deceit make them difficult to govern.

○ Páng said: "Cleverness makes them hard to know. Thus, governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state.

**Míng Huáng** said: "‘With’ is ‘use’ (*yòng*). If a ruler employs clever ministers to govern, they will inevitably create laws. When laws are made, wickedness thrives, hence they become the ruin of the state.

○ Hé said: "To let clever and wise people govern state affairs is to distance oneself from **virtue** and **power** (*déyuè*), to arbitrarily wield authority and rewards, and thus become the ruin of the state.

○ Bì said: "Cleverness is akin to governance (*zhì*). To govern with cleverness is why it is called ‘the ruin of the state.’ The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive cleverness. Thus, one must block their cunning and close the gates, making them ignorant and unmusical, while using cleverness to guard against stirring the people’s evil hearts. Once stirred, they will again resort to cleverness to guard against deceit, and their scheming will grow ever more refined, while wickedness and falsehood flourish further. Hence, it is said that governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state.

○ Páng said: "If one governs by discernment, the people will vie to emerge with their cleverness and deceit. *Zhuāngzi* says: ‘Those who open the way for others are the ones who breed thieves,’ referring to this very point. Not governing with cleverness is the blessing of the state.

**Míng Huáng** said: "If one does not employ clever and cunning ministers, but instead selects those of pure **virtue** (*chún dé*), who rest quietly and flourish naturally, who play with the **Way** (*dào*) and resolve difficulties, then cleverness and deceit will wane daily, while simplicity and **pǔ** (primordial simplicity) will arise. The people will be harmonious, and the years will bring abundance, hence this is the blessing of the state.

○ Hé said: "If one does not let clever and wise people govern state affairs, the people will uphold rectitude, not indulging in evil adornments. The ruler and subjects will grow close, and the sovereign and ministers will work together in harmony, hence this is the blessing of the state.

○ Páng said: "A ruler must model himself after Heaven, and modeling Heaven means embodying the **Dao**. To abandon the **Dao** and rely on cleverness is not his proper role. As for the **至人** (*Zhìrén*—perfected/true person), who does nothing yet the world returns to **pǔ** (primordial simplicity), the blessings are beyond words. *Zhuāngzi* says: ‘Those who close the gates of Heaven are where **virtue** (*dé*) arises,’ referring to this very point.

Knowing these two principles is also a standard (*kǎishì*).

**Míng Huáng** said: "Employing cleverness and deceit harms the people, while entrusting pure **virtue** (*chún dé*) brings blessings to the state. If a ruler knows these two principles, he will entrust himself to ministers of pure **virtue**, making them the standard and model for governance.

○ Hé said: "The two principles are cleverness and lack of cleverness. The clever can become thieves, while the unknowing can bring blessings, hence they are the standards for governing oneself and the realm.

○ Páng said: "‘Standard’ (*kǎi*) is sometimes written as ‘**稽**’ (*jì*). Knowing the standard is called **玄德** (*Xuándé*—mysterious virtue).

**Míng Huáng** said: "If a ruler always knows whom to entrust, this is called profound, mysterious, and supreme **virtue** (*dé*).

○ Hé said: "**玄** (*Xuán*) is Heaven. To know the standards of governing oneself and the realm is to align with Heaven’s **virtue** (*dé*).

**Míng Huáng** said: "**玄德** (*Xuándé*—mysterious virtue) is profound and distant.

○ Hé said: "The person of **玄德** (*Xuándé*) is profound beyond measure, distant beyond reach.

○ Bì said: "**稽** (*kǎi*) means ‘align.’ The principles that are consistent between ancient and modern must not be abandoned. To know the standard is to possess **玄德** (*Xuándé*), which is profound and distant.

**Míng Huáng** said: "The person of **玄德** (*Xuándé*) is contrary to all things. All things seek to benefit themselves, while the person of **玄德** benefits others.

○ Bì said: "It is contrary to their true nature.

○ Páng said: "**物** (*wù*) here means ‘affairs.’ Those who entrust themselves to **virtue** (*dé*) act contrary to affairs, yet affairs are ultimately governed through them—this is like the analogy of root and branch. The common people see only the shallow and near, following the branches while losing sight of the roots, hence they see only affairs and not **virtue**.

Then, only does one attain **大顺** (*Dàshùn*—great harmony).

**Míng Huáng** said: "**玄德** (*Xuándé*) is profound and distant, contrary to all things, returning to its root, thus all things attain **Dàshùn** (*great harmony*) in their natural spontaneity.

○ Hé said: "**玄德** (*Xuándé*) is contrary to all things, hence it can attain **Dàshùn** (*great harmony*), which follows Heaven’s principles.

○ Páng said: "At the time when **virtue** (*dé*) is entrusted, it seems contrary to affairs, yet affairs are ultimately governed through it. This is contrary to immediate appearances yet in harmony with the greater flow, hence the saying.

(Alternative reading: ‘Then only does one return to **Dàshùn** (*great harmony*).’)

**Jiāng Hǎi as the King of All Streams** (Chapter 66)

**Jiāng Hǎi** (*the Yangtze and Seas*) is able to be the King of All Streams because it is good at being lowly.

Hé said: "The **Jiāng Hǎi** (*Yangtze and Seas*) are humble, hence all the streams flow to them, just as the people flow to their king. Thus, they are able to be the King of All Streams.

**Míng Huáng** said: "**Jiāng Hǎi** (*the Yangtze and Seas*) are able to make all the rivers and streams converge and return to their source because they excel at being humble and lowly. Hence, all the rivers and streams pay homage to their **宗** (*Zōng*—ancestral root/sacred origin).

○ Hé said: "Because they are humble and lowly, they are able to be the King of All Streams.

○ Páng said: "The meaning of ‘king’ is to receive the flowing. It can accept all things without resistance, hence they flow to it. Therefore, the **至人** (*Zhìrén*—perfected/true person) desires to be above others,」

The **Jiāng Hǎi** (*Yangtze and Seas*) said: "To be above the people. By his words being humble; the **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "To act like the **Jiāng Hǎi** in being humble and lowly. To be before the people. By his body being behind them; the **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "To be before others while placing oneself behind. Thus, the **perfected/true person** (聖人) stands above others while the people do not feel burdened; the **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The **perfected/true person** is above the people as their sovereign, not using his noble status to oppress them like **Long** (龍) below, hence the people revere him without feeling burdened. He stands before them while the people do not feel harmed.

**Míng Huáng** said: "Humility is the **virtue/power** (德) of governance, while nobility brings added radiance. By humbling his words, the people joyfully revere him, hence he stands above them while none consider him burdensome. By retreating and placing himself behind, the people flock to him like children to a mother, hence he stands before them while none consider him harmful. The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The **perfected/true person** stands before the people, not using his radiance to obscure those behind him, so the people love him as a long-lost mother, with no desire to harm him."

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The **perfected/true person**’s virtue is vast and benevolent, hence the people of the world gladly acclaim him as sovereign without growing weary. **Míng Huáng** said: "Because of his being neither burdensome nor harmful, the people of the world gladly acclaim and honor him as their sovereign, without ever tiring."

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The **perfected/true person**’s kindness is profound and love is heavy; he views the people as his own children, hence the people of the world gladly acclaim and honor him as their sovereign without growing weary. The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The **perfected/true person** does not seek personal gain for this; it is merely **virtue/power** (德). When **virtue/power** is humble, its form is exalted; when **virtue/power** is behind, its form is before. Thus, he is always held in high esteem by the world.

Because he does not contend, the **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The world does not weary of the **perfected/true person**’s time, for he does not contend with others for precedence. Hence, none in the world can contend with him."

**Míng Huáng** said: "The **perfected/true person**’s humility and retreat are such that he does not contend with anything. The world collectively acclaims him—who would dare to contend?"

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Others all contend for their own interests, while I do not contend for **non-action** (無為). The world all say: The **Jiāng Hǎi**’s **Dao/Way** (道) is vast, like **not resembling** (不肖).

**Míng Huáng** said: "Resembling, that is to say, resembling. **Lǎo Jūn** (老君) said: 'The people of the world all say my **Dao/Way** (道) is vast, and there is nothing to which it resembles. I then reply:'

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "**Lǎo Jūn** speaks of the world saying my **virtue/power** (德) is vast, yet I feign ignorance, appearing not resembling. Only because it is truly vast does it seem not resembling. The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Only those whose **virtue/power** (德) is truly great are harmed by their own name, hence they feign ignorance, appearing not resembling, making no distinctions or divisions, not demeaning others while elevating themselves. If they were resembling for a long time, the **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Resembling, that is goodness. It refers to **discernment and kindness** (辨惠). If one is a great practitioner of discernment and kindness, his noble stature and virtuous conduct have long been established. But this is trivial.

**Míng Huáng** said: "Only my **Dao/Way** (道) is supremely vast, hence there is nothing to which it resembles. If, like the **Dài** (代) asking about all **laws** (法), there were something to which it resembled, it could not be called vast, and its greatness would have long been diminished and trivialized."

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Those who practice **discernment and kindness** (辨惠) are merely like petty men, not true **long-standing/wise ones** (長者)." ○ **Bì** (弼) said: "For a long time, it has been trivial. Still, it says, 'For a long time, it has been trivial.' If resembling, then it loses its claim to being great, hence the saying, 'If resembling for a long time, it has been trivial.'"

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Resembling means taking on a likeness, while the **Dao/Way** (道) is the ancestral root of all things. Thus, those who embody the **Dao/Way** should not resemble things—rather, all things should resemble them. If there is resemblance, then it is like imitating others, and thus others must be great while I am small. I have three treasures; the **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "All of these three treasures are what the common emotions call small, yet they are what the **perfected/true person** uses to be truly great."

Treasure and hold them: **Míng Huáng** said: "Though my **Dao/Way** (道) is vast and resembles nothing, I possess these three practices, which are truly precious. If one can always preserve and rely on them, they can govern oneself and the nation."

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "**Lǎo Zǐ** (老子) says I have three treasures, which I embrace and preserve. The first is **compassion** (慈). The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Love the people as one’s own children."

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "**Compassion** (慈) is rooted in love, and love is the **virtue/power** (德) of kindness toward all. Yet it is called **compassion** alone, for kindness extends broad **virtue/power** to cover those below, and its fullest manifestation is at the end. **Lǎo Zǐ** speaks of its origin, hence he does not say **kindness** (仁) but **compassion** (慈). **Compassion** is the **Dao/Way** of the father, the root of kindness, yet it does not depend on outward acts.

The second is **frugality** (俭). The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Taxation and levies should be like taking from oneself."

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The **virtue/power** of **frugality** (俭) is to have few desires, to honor the essentials, and to love all things. In one word, it encompasses three virtues. The **perfected/true person**’s restraint is such that if **Confucius** said, 'Let **rites** (禮) be frugal rather than extravagant,' it is because the **perfected/true person** establishes **rites** to promote **frugality**, yet when he does so, he cannot be solely restrained. Without **rites**, it is trivial; without **Lǎo Zǐ**, one does not know the essentials. Essential! Essential! The **perfected/true person**’s **Dao/Way** is thus supremely refined."

The third is: "I dare not be first for the world." **Míng Huáng** said: "**Compassion** (慈) leads to broad salvation, **frugality** (俭) ensures sufficiency, and not daring to be first for the world means the people gladly acclaim him without growing weary."

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Embracing humility and retreat, he does not initiate contention."

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "In the *I Ching*, it is **humility** (謙) that is spoken of. Heaven, earth, humans, and spirits all hold **humility** as noble, hence the **perfected/true person** treasures it. **Compassion** (慈) thus leads to **courage** (勇); **Míng Huáng** said: "**Compassion** (慈) is kind and gentle, hence his **courage** (勇) lies in salvation and aid."

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "For **kindness** (仁), hence his **courage** (勇) lies in loyalty and filial piety."

○ **Bì** (弼) said: "**Compassion** (慈) is such that when used in action, it prevails; when held in defense, it is steadfast, hence it leads to **courage** (勇)."

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "**Compassion** (慈) is victory without contention, and there is no greater **courage** (勇) than this."

**Frugality** (俭) thus leads to **broadness** (廣); **Míng Huáng** said: "**Frugality** (俭) is to cherish expenditure with restraint, ensuring abundance in wealth and resources, hence his deeds and benefits are ever more broad."

○ The **Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The sovereign’s body can practice **frugality**, hence the people’s daily use is broad."

○ **Bì** (弼) said: "**Frugality** (俭) cherishes expenditure with restraint, and the world is not impoverished, hence it leads to **broadness** (廣)."

○ **Pān** said: "Those who seek **broadness** (廣) through **excessive indulgence** (奢侈) are in truth the most **narrow-minded** (狭). Only those who do not let trivial matters harm the fundamental, nor external things extinguish the internal, attain true **broadness** (廣)."

One does not dare to act first for all under Heaven,
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Not to act first for all under Heaven."
Hence one can become the **vessel’s leader** (成器長).

**Míng Huáng** said: "The **virtue/power** (德) of **compassion** (慈) and **frugality** (俭) shines through **humility** (謙), and by giving precedence to others, people are never sated, hence one can become the **vessel’s leader** (神器之長)."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "To become the **vessel’s leader** (成器長) means to be the **Dao/Way-person** (得道人), and I can be the leader of such **Dao/Way-persons**."

**Bì** said: "Only by placing oneself last externally, becoming what all things return to, can one then establish the **vessel’s leadership** (成器), benefiting all under Heaven, and becoming the leader of all things."

**Pān** said: "This is the conduct of the **Sage** (聖人), hence it is merely to be the **vessel’s leader** (器長). If it were to be the leader of the **Dao/Way**, it would never lag behind things."

Now they abandon **compassion** (慈) and **courage** (勇),
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Now people abandon **compassion** (慈仁) and only pursue **martial valor** (勇武)."
**Bì** said: "Yet they still take [what they want]."
They abandon **frugality** (俭) and **broadness** (廣),
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "They abandon **frugality** (俭約) and only pursue **luxury** (奢華)."
They abandon **placing oneself last** (後) and **acting first** (先),
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "They abandon placing themselves last and only act first for others."
This is death.
**Míng Huáng** said: "Now they abandon **compassion** (慈) and **courage** (勇); **courage** harms things. They combine **audacity** (检) and **broadness** (廣); **broadness** depletes wealth. They hold **placing oneself last** and **acting first**; acting first invites resentment. Depleting wealth and harming things, gathering resentment from people—this is the path to certain death, hence it is said, 'This is death.'"

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Such conduct, in every action, leads to death."

**Pān** said: "To destroy humanity for Heaven, to let affairs overcome the **Dao/Way**—even if by chance they escape, they have lost what sustains life. The Three Treasures are all Heaven’s **virtue/power** (德) and fundamentals.

**Compassion** (慈), when deployed, is upright.
**Bì** said: "Confronting difficulties without retreat, hence upright."
**Pān** said: "Like the righteousness of proper arms—proper arms mean the army is disciplined yet unmoving. Loving the people as one’s children, the people love them as their father; they are orderly without command. Those who turn their weapons against their own rear do so because their superiors lack **compassion** (慈)." [One version reads: "When used in battle, it brings victory."]

When used in defense, it is steadfast.
**Míng Huáng** said: "Using **compassion** (慈) in battle benefits in preserving the multitude; using **compassion** in defense benefits in securing the people. Each preserves safety, hence one can achieve victory and steadfastness."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Those who practice **compassion** (慈) have the people naturally attached, their hearts and intentions unified, hence they can achieve victory in battle and firmness in defense."

**Pān** said: "In war and defense, the focus is on slaughter, yet **compassion** (慈) is still upheld as **virtue/power** (德)—the rest follows accordingly. Heaven will aid and protect them with **compassion**."

**Míng Huáng** said: "Using **compassion** (慈) in defense is not merely about human harmony; the **Dao/Way** of Heaven is profoundly clear and will also aid and protect. Victory in battle is Heaven’s aid. Steadfastness in defense is Heaven’s protection. All this is because of **compassion** (慈), hence it is said, 'Heaven will aid and protect them with **compassion**.'"

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Heaven aids those who are benevolent, certainly aligning with the nature of the **compassionate** (慈人), enabling them to self-nurture and assist."

**Pān** said: "The Three Treasures all take **compassion** (慈) as their core. Speaking of Heaven’s aid and protection is because of their **compassion**."

**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Virtuous Scholar**
The virtuous scholar does not rely on **martial valor** (武).
**Míng Huáng** said: "Scholar (士) means 'affairs' (事). The virtuous one who governs with the **Dao/Way** values **virtue/power** (德), hence it is said they do not rely on **martial valor**."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "It speaks of valuing **moral cultivation** (道德) over **martial force** (武力)."

**Bì** said: "Scholar (士) is the leader of soldiers (卒). **Martial valor** (武) is to value trampling others first."

**Pān** said: "Scholar (士) is not a title for achieving **virtue/power** (德), hence *scholar* (士) means 'to discern' (察) and 'martial' (武). The **judge** (狱师) is called *scholar* for discernment. The leader of soldiers is called *scholar* for martial prowess. Those who take **martial valor** (武) as their affair must root their **virtue/power** (德) in not relying on **martial valor**, for this is their foundation. Hence, those who rely on **martial valor** may still be called *scholars*, but they are not **virtuous scholars** (德士). The virtue of being a scholar lies in **virtue/power**."

The virtuous warrior does not grow angry.
**Míng Huáng** said: "When affairs cannot be avoided and one must confront the enemy, **compassion** (慈) makes it virtuous, hence one does not rely on anger."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The virtuous warrior who fights with the **Dao/Way** restrains evil in their heart, cutting off disaster before it sprouts, and does not indulge in slaughterous rage."

**Bì** said: "They act last yet do not lag, respond yet do not provoke, hence they are not driven by anger."

**Pān** said: "When **King Wǔ** of **Zhōu** grew angry and pacified all under Heaven, it was due to his affairs; in terms of **virtue/power** (德), he never grew angry."

The virtuous victor does not contend.
**Míng Huáng** said: "Military triumph lies in harmony; harmony brings virtuous victory, the ultimate in complete victory, hence there is no contention."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The virtuous warrior who conquers with the **Dao/Way** attracts the near with **ren** (仁) and the distant with **virtue/power** (德); they do not contend with the enemy, yet the enemy submits on its own."

**Bì** said: "They do not contend."

**Pān** said: "The **virtue/power** (德) of not contending sometimes involves contention, but contention is a matter of affairs; in **virtue/power**, there is never contention."

The virtuous user of people places themselves beneath them.
**Míng Huáng** said: "[Left blank in original]."

Persuading and ordering people to exhaust their efforts requires first placing oneself beneath them—this is the virtue of virtuous use.

This is called the **virtue/power** (德) of not contending,
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "It means the superior places themselves beneath the inferior."
This is the **moral cultivation** (道德) of not contending with people.

**Pān** said: "This is **virtue/power** (德), not affairs. This is the **Dao/Way** of **virtue/power** (德), hence it is always spoken of as **virtue/power**—the rest is similar."

This is called using their strength,
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "To personally place oneself beneath others is to use the strength of ministers."

**Bì** said: "If one uses people yet does not place themselves beneath them, their strength is not utilized."

**Pān** said: "All under Heaven aids them, hence they triumph over the strong without exerting force."

This is called aligning with Heaven.
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Those who practice this have **virtue/power** (德) that aligns with Heaven."

**Pān** said: "Not conforming to affairs yet attaining **virtue/power** (德), hence one can fulfill their nature. Fulfilling nature completes humanity, hence one can align with Heaven."

「This is the ultimate ancient principle.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "To excel without contention is the **virtue/power** (德) of non-striving. To place oneself beneath others is the strength of using people. Those who can do this may align with Heaven and be called an emperor—this is the most essential **Dao/Way** of the ancients."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "This is indeed the most essential **Dao/Way** of the ancients."
**Pān** said: "The phrase begins with *yǒu* (有, 'this is'), for the ultimate ancient principle is the **Dao/Way** of great centrality."

**On the Use of Arms (用兵有吉闷章第六十九)**

**The Use of Arms (用兵) has a saying:**
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "Laozi laments the age's kings and people harming one another through warfare, hence he expounds upon the ancient ways to issue a warning. The saying refers to the following lines."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "He sets forth the **Dao/Way** of using arms, for Laozi despises the age's use of warfare, hence he employs this text to establish its meaning."

*"I dare not be the host,*
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Host (主) means to act first; I dare not first raise arms."

*but I will be the guest.*
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Guest (客) means to respond without initiating, to use arms only after Heaven's will is followed."

**Pān** said: "To stir up attack is to be the host of arms. I bear the burden as a guest."

*"I dare not advance an inch, but retreat a foot.*
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "If the host takes action, it generates strife and greed. Without scheming or doing, one guards with benevolence. Guarding preserves total victory, while strife leads to defeat. Though advancing is slight, one cannot avoid conflict; though retreating is much, it does not lose humility, hence I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "To encroach upon another’s territory or seize their wealth is advancing; to close the gates and defend the city is retreating."

**Pān** said: "To not be bold in slaughter."

*"This is called acting without acting,*
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "To retreat as a guest and not contend with others—though one acts to repel the enemy, it is akin to acting without acting."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "If they persist unchecked, they become bandits to all under Heaven; though one acts to punish them, it is not done with force."

**Bì** said: "If they persist unchecked..."
**Pān** said: "The benevolent use of arms has conquest without battle, akin to acting without acting."

*"To take without arms,*
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "To bare an arm signifies anger; the skilled warrior does not anger. Hence, it is as if there are no arms to bare."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Though one desires great anger, it is as if there are no arms to bare."

*"To seize without weapons,*
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "To 'seize' (仍) means to draw out. Drawing out the enemy is to desire contention without contending, hence it is as if there are no weapons to seize."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Though one desires to draw out the enemy, it is as if there are no weapons to seize."

**Bì** said: "To act (行) means to deploy troops. The saying is: with humility, benevolence, and pity, one does not dare act first; using war is akin to acting without acting, to bare without arms, to seize without weapons, to draw without enemies. This means there is none to oppose them."

*"To seize without weapons,"*
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "To seize weapons signifies killing; now benevolence is the principle, hence though one seizes weapons, it is akin to seizing none."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Though one desires to seize and use them, it is as if there are no weapons or blades to hold."

*"Why so?*
Because harming their people brings retribution from Heaven, encountering unrighteous rulers evokes pity for their suffering."

**Pān** said: "Though there is the name of battle, the enemy is nonexistent before it, hence it is akin to no battle."

*"No disaster is greater than lightly regarding the enemy,*
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The harm of disorder and chaos is nothing greater than deceiving and lightly regarding the enemy, encroaching without rest, and greedily waging war for wealth. Lightly regarding the enemy nearly causes the loss of my precious self."

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "The greatest disaster is lightly regarding the enemy, for those who lightly regard the enemy nearly lose their precious benevolence."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "*Jī* (几) means near. *Bǎo* (宝) means the body. To deceive and lightly regard the enemy is to nearly lose one’s life."

**Bì** said: "The saying is: my benevolence and humility are not for seizing strength; I have no enemy under Heaven. If I am forced to the point of having no enemy, this is the reason why I bring about great disaster. *Bǎo* (宝) refers to the Three Treasures (三宝), hence it is said that I nearly lose my Treasures."

**Pān** said: "Arms are cruel instruments; yet the benevolent warrior, though unstoppable, does not dare lightly regard the enemy. To lightly regard the enemy is to lose one’s benevolence, and to lose benevolence is to risk defeat."

*"Hence, when armies clash,*
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Two enemies battle."

*the compassionate shall prevail.*
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "To clash (抗) means to raise arms. When two nations raise arms against each other, the one who guards with benevolence and compassion shall prevail."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The compassionate are benevolent and kind; their soldiers do not shun death."

**Bì** said: "To clash (抗) means to raise arms. *Ruò* (若) means to meet. The compassionate must necessarily hold each other in regard, and not pursue gain or avoid harm, hence they must prevail."

**Pān** said: "Compassion and pity are benevolence; benevolence gives courage, hence they prevail."

One text reads *xiāng ruò* (相若), which is also acceptable. *Ruò* (若) means that the armies’ forces are equal.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "I have often pondered this: the *Shū* (书) says, 'Let your威克厥爱允济,' and again, 'Exhort, O prince, and be resolute!' Yet Laozi’s words on arms are always thus—this is the **Dao/Way** of using arms. The other is merely the practice of arms; the Sage does not differ in intent, but their words differ due to the times."

---
**My Sayings Are Very Easy to Know (吾－禹甚易知章第七十)**

*"My sayings are very easy to know,*
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "Laozi says, 'My words accord with the Way, hence easy to know; my affairs are simple, hence easy to practice.'"

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Laozi’s words are concise and easy to know, brief and easy to practice."

*"Yet none under Heaven can know or practice them.*
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "People under Heaven are entangled in words and do not awaken, burdened by affairs and not simplified, hence none can know or practice them."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "People detest softness and weakness, yet favor strength and rigidity."

*"The Master said:*
**Bi** said: "One may know it without stepping outside—glimpsing through a window suffices, hence 'very easy to know.' Without action, it is accomplished, hence 'very easy to practice.' Confused by restless desires, hence none can know it. Bewildered by honor and profit, hence none can practice it."

**Páng** said: "The Sage follows the utmost of nature and life as his teaching. He does not weary with simplicity, nor does he contrive the unusual—merely returning to oneself. Thus, one knows that aligning with nature is natural. If one seeks to know and practice it, how could it not be very easy?

All difficult matters under Heaven arise from abandoning the root for the branches, from reckless contrivance. Thus, inner and outer chaos ensues, strange things proliferate, and wisdom cannot prevail. Only when one departs from this does a single word suffice. Though it is very easy to know and practice, none can do so because their minds are fixed on trifles and they pursue the strange and difficult.

There is a root for speech, a master for affairs.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "Speech rests in principle; when principle is attained, speech is forgotten, hence speech takes 'no-speech' as its root. Affairs rest in function; when function is fulfilled, there is no governance, hence affairs take 'no-affairs' as their master."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "My words have a fundamental origin; affairs have their hierarchy. Those who do not understand are not without virtue—it is their hearts that oppose mine."

**Bi** said: "Root is the root of all things; master is the sovereign of all affairs."

**Páng** said: "Speech returns to principle; affairs rest in the Dao. Knowing principle and Dao, even if speech and affairs are many, there is nothing difficult to know. It is only the lack of knowing that makes them unknown to others."

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "Only the vulgar lack enlightened knowing, hence they do not know my teaching of no-speech and no-affairs."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The world is my virtue’s barrier—hidden from view, probing the subtle and reaching the marvelous, hence none know it."

**Bi** said: "Because my words have a root and my affairs a master, those who know cannot fail to know."

**Páng** said: "What is called knowing is not ultimate principle—such knowing is not true knowing. To presume knowing while not knowing the Sage, can this be called knowing? Few know me, hence I am noble."

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "Few comprehend the intent of forgetting knowing, hence my unsaid teaching is most noble."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Few—meaning rare. Only those who grasp the Dao can know me, hence my nobility."

**Bi** said: "Only the profound understand, hence few know me. The fewer who know me, the more I stand alone—thus, 'few know me, hence I am noble.'"

**Páng** said: "The Dao is vast, so few know it. Across ten thousand generations, one may know it—like encountering it at dawn or dusk. Some texts read: 'then I am noble.' Thus, the Sage wears coarse robes while treasuring jade within."

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "Wearing coarse robes—obscuring the exterior. Treasuring jade—illuminating the interior. Hence few know me."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Wearing coarse robes—thin without. Treasuring jade—rich within. Concealing treasure, hoarding virtue, not revealing it to others."

**Bi** said: "Wearing coarse robes blends with dust; treasuring jade cherishes the true. The Sage’s difficulty in being known lies in blending with dust yet not differing, treasuring jade yet not waning—hence difficult to know and thus noble."

**Páng** said: "Is it to distinguish oneself by display? Chapter Seventy: Knowing the Unknown

Knowing the unknown—how profound!
**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Claiming to know while unknown is the highest virtue."

**Páng** said: "Not recognizing the unknown is the ultimate knowing. To know while unknown is an ailment."

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "Realizing the emptiness of dharma-nature, originally not knowing dharma, in knowing, forgetting knowing—this is the highest virtue. To know while unknown, dharma-nature being empty, yet in knowing, forcing knowledge—this is the disease of practice."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Claiming to know while unknown is the disease of virtue."

**Bi** said: "The inability to know while unknown is the ailment."

**Páng** said: "The Dao cannot be known, nor is it worth knowing, yet they presume to know clearly—this is not having grasped the Dao at all. Not having grasped the Dao yet presuming to know is mere delusion, and the ailment is grave.

Only by recognizing the ailment does one avoid it.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "Only by recognizing the ailment of forced knowing does one not fall prey to it."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Only by recognizing the ailment—if the masses have the ailment of forced knowing—does one not fall prey to it. The Sage’s freedom from ailment lies in recognizing the ailment in others. Hence, not falling prey to it."

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "Only the Sage does not fall prey to this ailment because they recognize the masses’ forced knowing. Hence, not falling prey to it."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "This is not human—hence not falling prey to it. The Sage harbors comprehensive knowing, cloaked in unknownness, desiring the world to be sincere and loyal, each guarding their pure nature. The petty do not understand this intent yet recklessly pursue forced knowing, seeking display, internally harming their spirit, diminishing life and years."

**Bi** said: "Recognizing the ailment means knowing its cause."

**Páng** said: "If one is ailing yet unaware, the ailing will never awaken.

Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear威 for Long
The people do not fear威, then great威 arrives.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: "威 is what can be feared when present. If people are careless in minor matters, then great and fearful威 emerges."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "威 is harm."

「People do not fear minor harm, then major harm arrives—this is death.

Those who fear it must cherish their *qi* (spirit), conforming to Heaven and aligning with Earth.

**Páng** said: "When the people are pure and thick in virtue, they fear *威*. When the ruler loses the Dao/Way, indulges in excessive action, and diminishes the Dao/Way, obstructing their natural flow, the people become cunning and deceitful, and *威* cannot subdue them. Thus, when Heaven’s retribution is invoked, calamity and disorder arise, so it is said that great *威* arrives. Do not constrict their dwelling—

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "The place where the spirit resides is the heart."

To not constrict means to remove emotions and desires, leaving the heart empty and pure, generating *white* (purity).

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "It means the spirit resides in the heart, which should be expansive and gentle, not narrow and constricted."

Do not exhaust their natural inclinations—

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "What the body produces is the spirit.

To not exhaust means to think little and desire little, so as not to overburden oneself.

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "The reason people are born is to possess *qi* (spirit), relying on emptiness, delighting in tranquility and simplicity. If they do not regulate their diet, neglect the Dao/Way while fixating on color, fill their hearts with perversity, they are indeed exhausting their foundation and offending the spirit.

**Bi** said: "Tranquility and non-action are called *residence* (居), humility and modesty are called *natural inclinations* (生). Though one practices tranquility, if they indulge in hasty desires, abandon humility to pursue arrogance, and submit to *威*, then chaos disturbs and the people grow perverse. *威* can no longer control them. The virtuous cannot endure such *威*, so the ruler and people collapse in great disorder, and Heaven’s retribution is near. Hence it is said: ‘If the people do not fear *威*, then great *威* arrives.’

Do not constrict their dwelling, do not exhaust their natural inclinations—this means *威* cannot be relied upon.

**Páng** said: "The people’s nature is originally broad and flowing, but as the teachings of the world decline, they cannot return to their original purity. Instead, their dwelling is narrowed and their natural inclinations are obstructed. It is because their dwelling is constricted that the people are not sincere but deceitful; it is because their natural inclinations are exhausted that the people are not virtuous but thin and narrow.

The Sage does not do this. Instead, they let the people roam freely in the vast dwelling of the world, each fulfilling their boundless natural inclinations, so that none would dare offend *威*.

*The Zhuangzi* says: ‘The sparse borders of the State of Wéi, the hunting grounds of the Yellow Emperor, the territories of Yao and Shun, the halls of Tang and Wu—these are the signs of the world’s gradual decline, narrowing their dwellings.’

The Sage is not unequal, yet their dwelling is narrowed by the times they face. Only when one does not exhaust—

**Bi** said: "It means not exhausting oneself."

Thus it is said: "Only when people do not exhaust their spirit does the spirit not exhaust them."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Only when one does not exhaust their spirit does the spirit reside without exhaustion. They cleanse the heart of impurities, maintaining calm and desirelessness, so the spirit dwells without exhaustion.

**Bi** said: "Not exhausting oneself means the world does not exhaust you. The people do not exhaust you—

**Páng** said: "The ruler does not exhaust their own natural inclinations while fully expressing their nature, so the people also gain to express their nature."

*The Zhuangzi* says: ‘This is what is meant by not exhausting one’s Heaven.’ Exhaustion is Heaven’s exhaustion of them. Hence the Sage knows themselves—

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "They know their own gains and losses."

They do not display themselves—

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "They do not flaunt their virtue and beauty outwardly, but keep it inwardly."

They cherish themselves—

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "They cherish their body to preserve their *qi* (spirit).

They do not exalt themselves—

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "They know their own body, guarding against fearful matters. They cherish their body, avoiding Heaven’s retribution for exhausting the spirit. They do not display their abilities to provoke Heaven’s wrath, nor do they exalt themselves to gather resentment."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "They do not seek high honor or fame in the world."

**Bi** said: "If one exalts themselves, others will grow narrow and resentful, exhausting their dwelling and natural inclinations.

**Páng** said: "If one displays themselves, they become proud and self-centered; if one exalts themselves, they belittle others. This is how one constricts their own dwelling and exhausts their own natural inclinations, just as they constrict the people’s dwelling and exhaust the people’s natural inclinations.

Self-knowledge clarifies one’s nature, preventing reckless action. Self-cherishing preserves one’s body, preventing wrongdoing. Thus, how could they ever offend Heaven’s *威*?

Hence, abandon that and embrace this.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "Abandon that which leads to exaltation, embrace this which leads to self-knowledge and cherishing."

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Abandon that which leads to self-display and self-exaltation, embrace this which leads to self-knowledge and self-cherishing."

**Chapter Seventy-Three: On Courage (勇於敢)**
Courage in daring leads to death—

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Courage and daring with excessive action lead to self-destruction."

**Bi** said: "They will certainly not achieve their natural end."

Courage in not daring leads to life—

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "Daring means decisive action. If one is courageous in decisive action yet lacks humility and yielding, they will surely harm themselves—hence it is said to lead to death. Not daring means they can preserve their life.

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Courage in not daring with excessive action preserves their life."

**Bi** said: "They will certainly achieve longevity."

**Páng** said: "The daring are those who act recklessly, following their *qi* to create matters, lightly regarding death for the sake of their actions, treating actions as the Dao/Way. The courageous yet not daring move only when pressed, not preemptively competing with others for glory, treating the Dao/Way as their actions.

These two types—

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "They refer to daring and not daring.

One is beneficial, the other harmful—

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "Preserving life is beneficial; self-destruction is harmful."

**Bi** said: "Both are courageous, yet their applications differ, so benefit and harm diverge—hence it is said one is beneficial, the other harmful.

**Páng** said: "What people deem beneficial, Heaven truly harms—hence it is said: ‘Heaven’s noble ones are the world’s petty ones.’ If people consider them petty, they are indeed the ones the world follows, yet Heaven truly precedes them. What Heaven abhors—

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: "It abhors excessive action.

Who knows its reason?

**Emperor Minghuang** said: "These two types—daring and not daring—are the ones. Some are excessive in action.»

Those who know when *not* to dare have benefit, while those who dare have harm—one must be courageous in *not* daring. This is the courageous person.

Action brings disaster and harm, which is what Heaven abhors. Who can truly know its reason?

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: *"Who can know Heaven’s intent and not transgress?"*

**Zhòng** said: *"The lowly and the small-witted see only what benefits the crowd and do not know what Heaven abhors. Thus, the following passage clarifies the *Dao* of Heaven—one must observe it as law."*

Therefore, even the Sage finds it difficult.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"The Sage still finds daring deeds difficult."*

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: *"This speaks of the Sage’s enlightened *virtue*—even daring is difficult for them, let alone those without the Sage’s *virtue* who would attempt it."*

**Páng** said: *"The Sage harmonizes with Heaven’s *virtue*, yet still does not lightly promise or act frivolously."*

The *Dao* of Heaven does not contend yet is good at victory.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"Here, it speaks of Heaven’s humility and modesty, warning against human daring."*

Heaven does not contend with things. The four seasons fill and empty, and nothing resists—thus, it is good at victory.

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: *"Heaven does not contend with people over nobility or lowliness, yet people naturally fear it."*

**Bi** said: *"Only because it does not contend, the world cannot contend with it."*

**Páng** said: *"Heaven is the parent of all things—how could it be an enemy to its children? This is how it is good at victory."*

It does not speak yet responds well.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"How does Heaven speak? It rewards the virtuous and punishes the licentious without distinction—thus, it is said to respond well."*

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: *"Heaven does not speak, yet all things move in response to the seasons."*

**Bi** said: *"Compliance brings fortune; defiance brings calamity—it responds without speaking."*

**Páng** said: *"How does Heaven speak? The four seasons proceed, all things flourish, rewarding virtue and punishing licentiousness—its retribution encompasses myriad transformations without exception."*

It does not summon yet they come of their own accord.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"The *Dao* of Heaven does not summon things to follow it; things cannot defy it and come naturally in accordance with Heaven."*

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: *"Heaven does not summon—things follow it naturally."*

All things bear *yin* and turn toward *yang*.

When summoned, all things bear *yin* and turn toward *yang*.

**Bi** said: *"If one is humble, things will naturally gather."*

**Páng** said: *"To be summoned by others is the way of the subject and child."*

Heaven is the sovereign and parent—who can control it? When its course arrives, things come; it is not summoned.

It is open yet skillfully plans.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"The *Dao* of Heaven is profound and vast, broad and expansive, manifesting symbols and transformations—people can take it as a model, hence it is said to plan skillfully."*

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: *"‘Open’ means broad. Though Heaven’s *Dao* is vast and expansive, it skillfully plans for human affairs, rewarding virtue and punishing vice, each receiving its due."*

**Bi** said: *"It manifests symbols to show fortune and calamity, preempts events with warnings, remains secure yet does not forget danger, and plans before omens appear—thus, it is said to be open yet skillfully plan."*

**Páng** said: *"It is always easy, hence open; it is always perilous, hence skillful in planning."*

One version reads: *"It is broad yet skillfully plans."*

The Heavenly Net is vast and wide, sparse yet never misses.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"Though Heaven’s net is vast and distant, it punishes licentiousness and rewards virtue without the slightest error."*

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: *"The net Heaven weaves is vast and great—though distant, it oversees and judges human virtue and vice without fail."*

**Páng** said: *"Heaven follows principle, not whim. Its rewards and punishments are entrusted to natural consequences—like a tree bearing flowers, it must bear fruit. How could it open flowers without bearing fruit, yet fail to conform to principle?"*

Now, people of this age doubt the correspondence of fortune and calamity, shackled by petty wisdom, selfish and willful, yet unaware of principle. Thus, they see only one side and fail to grasp the grand governance. Knowing this *Dao*, one understands that in the world, virtue and vice, calamity and fortune, follow the measure of one’s capacity—each has its own timing of response, yet none escape retribution.

Moreover, when the Sage governs, they value *wu-wu* [effortless action]. If one scrutinizes Heaven’s great *Dao* with a probing mind, its retribution could never be exhaustive.

The people do not commonly fear death.

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: *"When rulers impose cruel punishments, the people have no means to live, hence they do not fear death. For those governing themselves, excessive desires harm the spirit, and reckless spending kills the body—the people do not know to fear this. How can one frighten them with death?"*

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"If one indulges in desires and acts recklessly, leading to death, and this becomes habitual, those who do not fear death—how can rulers further establish laws and execute killings to instill fear?"*

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: *"Rulers should lighten punishments and teach the people to abandon desires. How can they establish laws to frighten with death?"*

**Páng** said: *"When the ruler loses the *Dao*, customs become corrupt and the people are impoverished. With no means to sustain life, they defy laws, yet the ruler still frightens them with death—though many are killed, rebellion will not cease. This is the case since Qin."*

If the people were to commonly fear death,

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: *"One must eliminate one’s own cruelty and teach the people to abandon greed."*

Yet those who act strangely—if I seize and kill them, who would dare?

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"If the people all follow the transformation of *wu-wei* [non-action], daring not to indulge in desires, constantly fearing death, and only the deceitful few act strangely—even if I, in my power, seize and kill these deceitful ones, who would dare to do so?"*

Thus, the following passage states:

**Jiāng Hǎi** said: *"If one governs with the *Dao*, yet the people do not comply and instead act deceitfully, they should be arrested and executed according to law—who would dare to transgress?"*

Laozi lamented that the ruling kings did not first transform with *Dao* and *virtue*, but instead relied on punishments.

**Bi** said: *"Deceitful and disorderly behavior is called ‘strange.’"*

**Páng** said: *"The *virtue* of cherishing life permeates the people’s hearts, and they hold death in reverence—only then can punishments be enforced and things brought into submission."*

There is always someone appointed to kill.

Emperor Ming said: *"For such deceitful ones, the Heavenly Net does not fail—it is the Heavenly Appointee who kills them."*

**He** said: *"The Heavenly Appointee stands high above, overseeing all, and examines human transgressions. The Heavenly Net is vast and open, yet it does not fail. But if one substitutes for the Heavenly Appointee, it is as though a clumsy artisan were to take the place of the Master Carpenter in felling timber."*

Emperor Ming said: *"The Way of Heaven is most clear, and the Appointee to kill has its fixed order—like the seasons of spring growth, summer lengthening, autumn harvest, and winter storage, or the movement of the Dipper and Handle (星辰) to regulate and govern. If a ruler attempts to substitute for the Heavenly Appointee in killing, it is like a clumsy artisan taking the place of the Master Carpenter in cutting wood, laboring without success."*

**Pang** said: *"The ruler is exalted, the minister is lowly; each has its fixed role. The ruler acts with non-action (無為) and entrusts to the Dao, while the minister acts with purpose (有為) and governs affairs. The Dao and affairs are vastly different. Thus, when it comes to judicial executions, there is the Heavenly Appointee; when it comes to woodworking, there is the Master Carpenter. The ruler does not interfere—only to complete what is above him. The world knows that substituting in judgment is wrong, yet does not realize the loss inherent in substituting in killing. The *Zhuangzi* says: 'The ruler has action, the minister has action—this is where the ruler and minister share the same *virtue*.' The Classic says: 'What did Shun do? Only to be respectful and correct his posture facing south.' The Dao encompasses all affairs, so the ruler can encompass the minister. Yet if the ruler meddles in all affairs, he loses what makes him a ruler. If the minister meddles in all affairs and resorts to killing and punishing, it is even more contrary to the Dao. Hence, it is deeply elaborated upon. The *Classic* truly states that one does not use military might to coerce the world, yet it still says, 'Use the Dao to assist the ruler'—for if the Dao is the ruler, who would bother discussing that which is secondary? One reading has 'as though' (夫) instead of 'the ruler' (君). If one substitutes for the Master Carpenter in cutting, it is rare that one does not harm one’s hands. Emperor Ming said: 'If a clumsy artisan substitutes in cutting, not only does he harm the wood, but he also harms his own hands. If a ruler takes charge of punishments, substituting for the Heavenly Appointee, not only does he cruelly harm the people, but he also forfeits the Heavenly Harmony.' **He** said: 'If a ruler enforces punishments, it is like a clumsy artisan substituting for the Master Carpenter in cutting wood—then the square and round cannot be properly achieved, and the one who substitutes for Heaven in killing will himself suffer harm. If the principles of governance are not upheld, the ruler will bear the consequences.' **Bi** said: 'This is what those who reverse order and justice despise and resent, and what the unmerciful harm among the people—hence, it is said that there is always the Heavenly Appointee to kill.' **Pang** said: 'Substituting in cutting only harms one’s hands, but substituting in killing is to lose the Dao entirely.'" One reading lacks the character 有 (*has*). The people’s hunger is the seventy-fifth chapter.

The people’s hunger is due to the excessive taxes imposed by their superiors.

**He** said: *"The people suffer hunger and cold because their lords and rulers levy excessive taxes upon them. Hence, they hunger."*

**Ming Huang** said: *"The reason the people of the world suffer from hunger and insufficiency is that their lords and rulers consume and tax them excessively."*

**He** said: *"The people all emulate their superiors in greed, abandoning the Dao and violating virtue—thus, they hunger."*

**Pang** said: *"Establishing official ranks and stipends, instituting rites and expenditures—these are meant to enrich the people. Yet with increased costs and taxes, the roots wither while the branches flourish, and this only serves to make them hunger."*

One reading lacks the character 有 (*has*).

The people’s difficulty in governance arises from their superiors’ excessive actions.

**He** said: *"The people are ungovernable because their lords and rulers are overambitious and fond of action. Hence, they are difficult to govern."*

**Ming Huang** said: *"The reason the people of the world are so difficult to guide and transform is that their lords and rulers engage in excessive actions. Excessive actions bring many difficulties, and difficulties breed deceit—thus, they are difficult to govern."*

**He** said: *"Therefore, the people emulate their superiors’ actions, and their falsehoods make them hard to govern."*

**Pang** said: *"If one relies on scrutiny to create strife, it is meant to govern the people. Yet the people become impoverished and their customs refined, while cunning and deceit only grow—making them even harder to govern. This is evident when comparing the ancient past with later times."*

The people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive pursuit of life.

**He** said: *"The people lightly risk death because their means of seeking life are too extravagant, and their greed for gain endangers themselves. Hence, they lightly court death."*

**Ming Huang** said: *"The reason the people of the world so lightly regard death is that they violate natural measures in their pursuit of life—hence, they lightly court death."*

**He** said: *"Because their pursuit of life is too extravagant, they lightly enter perilous situations."*

**Pang** said: *"If one does not truly possess life, then life remains whole. But if they exceed natural measures, their desires know no end, leading them to offend laws and court danger—thus, they regard death lightly. These three cases all arise from seeking what harms their very means of seeking. This clearly illustrates the principle of *wuwei* (non-action). Only those who do not excessively pursue life are truly wiser than those who prize life."*

**Ming Huang** said: *"Natural measure suffices for life’s preservation, but if nourishment exceeds this measure, life perishes. Thus, those who do not excessively pursue life are wiser than those who overly cherish it."*

**He** said: *"Only those who do not make life their concern—whose titles and wealth hold no sway over them, whose riches and profits do not enter their bodies—are wiser than those who prize life. Even the Son of Heaven cannot command them, nor lords employ them."*

**Bi** said: *"This speaks of how the people’s deviations and the chaos in governance all stem from the superiors, not the inferiors. The people follow their superiors. This passage may not be the work of Laozi."*

**Pang** said: *"Excessive pursuit of life inevitably leads to regarding death lightly. Only those who do not make life their concern can remain whole. Those who prize life are merely wiser than those who regard death lightly, but they do not reach the ultimate wisdom of *wuwei*. This chapter clarifies one of these three matters; the other two may be inferred."*

**Chapter Seventy-Six: On the Nature of Life**

Human life is soft and weak.

**He** said: *"At birth, humans are filled with harmonious *qi* and embrace spirit—hence, they are soft and weak."*

At death, they become rigid and strong.

**He** said: *"At death, harmonious *qi* is exhausted and spirit departs—hence, they become rigid and strong."*

Grass and trees, in life, are soft and brittle.

**He** said: *"This is because harmonious *qi* remains."*

At death, they wither and decay.

**He** said: *"This is because harmonious *qi* departs."*

Thus, rigidity and strength are the companions of death, while softness and weakness are the companions of life.

**Ming Huang** said: *"The softness and weakness of life are the completeness of harmonious *qi*. The rigidity and strength of death are the dispersal of harmonious *qi*. Those who uphold softness and weakness preserve life and extend years. Those who rely on rigidity and strength lose their bodies and forfeit their nature."*

**He** said: *"From the two cases above, one knows that rigidity and strength lead to death, while softness and weakness lead to life. Hence, strong armies do not prevail."*

**Ming Huang** said: *"Those who show compassion win—thus, those who rely on strength must surely fail."*

**He** said: *"Strong armies, eager for battle and delighting in slaughter, spread poison and breed resentment, while the weak unite against them—thus, the strong do not prevail."*

**Bi** said: *"Armies that rely on violence across the land are what all things despise—thus, they cannot prevail."*

**Pang** said: *"The skilled conqueror accumulates small defeats to achieve great victory. If one takes strength as virtue, their cause will surely weaken."*

Wood that is strong is felled.

**Ming Huang** said: *"The strong trunk lies low, while the supple branches grow upward. This is because the supple and weak occupy the high ground, while the rigid and strong occupy the low."*

**He** said: *"Strong wood bears branches and leaves above it."*

**Bi** said: *"This is where things are applied."*

**Pang** said: *"It is cut down and felled."*

Thus, rigidity and strength reside below.

**Bi** said: *"This is the root of greatness."*

Softness and weakness occupy the high ground.

**He** said: *"When nurturing things and achieving deeds, great trees are rooted below, while small things rise above. The Great Dao suppresses the strong and upholds the weak—this is the natural order."*

**Bi** said: *"This refers to branches and twigs."*

**Pang** said: *"I have often reflected: The Dao of yin and yang is such that yin precedes and yang follows. Heaven and Earth are such that Heaven is exalted and Earth is humble. Thus, in matters of *de* (virtue/power), softness and weakness suffice to overcome rigidity and strength, while in calculating affairs, rigidity and strength suffice to govern softness and weakness. Yet people of the world observe affairs without comprehending *de*—thus, those called 'strong' often become companions of death."*

One reading has *"strong and great"* instead of *"strong"* in *"strong and great reside below."*

**Chapter Seventy-Seven: The Dao of Heaven**

**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Dao of Heaven and the Gentle and Weak**

The Dao of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"The Dao of Heaven is profound and distant; if it cannot be explained directly, then the analogy of drawing a bow is used to illustrate its function."*

**He** said: *"The Dao of Heaven is obscure; thus, comparisons with things are made to explain it."*

The high are suppressed, the low are elevated; the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"When drawing a bow in this way, only then can one hit the mark—just as the Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency, desiring that the sovereign emulate Heaven’s Dao in governing the people. Hence, it demonstrates the way of suppressing the high and elevating the low."*

**He** said: *"Speaking of the bow’s balanced harmony—only then can it be used."*

To suppress the high and elevate the low, to diminish the strong and supplement the weak—this is the Dao of Heaven.

The Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency.

**He** said: *"The Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency, always valuing moderation and harmony as supreme."*

**Pang** said: *"The Dao of Heaven follows its natural course, thus achieving balance."*

One reading substitutes *with* for *supplement*.

But the Dao of humanity is not so.

**He** said: *"The Dao of humanity is contrary to the Dao of Heaven."*

**Bi** said: *"Only by aligning with Heaven and Earth’s virtue can one encompass all things. Like the Dao of Heaven, like the measure of humanity—each has its own nature, and they cannot be equalized. Only when there is no self, no private interest in natural spontaneity, can one then align with Heaven and Earth’s virtue."*

To diminish deficiency and serve excess.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"The Dao of Heaven distributes evenly, taking from the abundant to aid the scarce, while humanity defies Heaven, instead diminishing the deficient."*

**He** said: *"Common people diminish the poor to serve the rich, plunder the weak to strengthen the powerful."*

**Pang** said: *"The Dao of humanity follows desire, thus it is unbalanced."*

Who, then, can diminish excess and serve deficiency throughout the world? Only the Dao can do so.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"Who can use their own excess to serve the deficiency of the world? Only the Dao can do so."*

**He** said: *"Who can occupy a position of excess, self-reflecting to forgo rank and wealth to serve the world’s deficiency? Only the sovereign of the Dao can act thus."*

**Pang** said: *"The Dao aligns with Heaven’s Dao."*

One reading states: *"Who can use excess to serve the world? Only the Dao can do so."*

Thus, the Sage acts without relying [on results],

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"The Sage follows Heaven, measures things appropriately, and distributes evenly, yet does not rely on his deeds."*

**He** said: *"The Sage acts in virtue and distribution, not expecting recompense."*

[The Sage] completes deeds without claiming them.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"He attributes success to others, not dwelling on achievement."*

**He** said: *"When deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell in that position."*

**Pang** said: *"One reading substitutes *dwell* for *claim*."*

Is it not because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous?

**He** said: *"He does not wish others to know of his virtue, concealing his deeds to avoid fame, fearing Heaven’s punishment for excess."*

**Pang** said: *"If one relies on deeds to claim achievement, then virtue is seen, and excess follows—this is the path to ruin."*

One reading omits the character *evil*.

**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Gentle and Weak of the World**

---

**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Gentle and Weak of the World (continued)**

**Chapter Seventy-Nine: Harmonizing Great Grievances**

The world has none more gentle and weak than water.
**He** said: *"It is round when round, square when square, clings when pressed, flows when released. Yet in overcoming the firm and strong, none can surpass it."*
**He** said: *"Water can embrace mountains and level hills, erode iron and dissolve copper—none can conquer water and achieve success."*

Is it not because nothing can replace it?
**He** said: *"To overcome the firm and strong, nothing is more unreplaceable than water."*

**Pang** said: *"Water adapts to all shapes—round, square, curved, straight—yet never alters its own nature. This is why it ultimately conquers all."*

Jade and stone are firm and strong, yet when used to attack others, they often shatter—because they can be altered.

The gentle and weak overcome the strong,
**He** said: *"Water can extinguish fire, and yin can consume yang. Softness can conquer rigidity."*
**He** said: *"The tongue is soft, the teeth are rigid, yet the teeth perish before the tongue."*

None in the world does not know,
**He** said: *"All know that the gentle and weak endure long, while the rigid and strong are broken and injured."*

Yet none can practice it.

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"The Dao/Way of the gentle and weak surpasses that of the rigid and strong. None in the world does not know this. Though all know the Dao/Way, none can practice it."*

**He** said: *"They are ashamed of humility, yet love rigidity and force."*

**Pang** said: *"Few possess this one virtue."*

One reading states: *"Originally, it was written: 'Softness conquers rigidity, weakness overcomes strength.'"*

Thus the Sage speaks:
**He** said: *"Referring to governance."*

To bear the filth of the state is called the sovereign of the land.
**He** said: *"A ruler who bears the state’s filth, like the sea that does not reject small streams, can long preserve the land and become its sovereign."*

**Pang** said: *"Filth is not as grave as ill omens, so it is only called the sovereign of the land."*

To bear the ill omens of the state is called the king of the world.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"To assume the guilt of all is to bear the state’s filth. To claim 'loneliness, poverty, and lack of grain' is to bear the ill omens of the state. If his virtue is thus, then the land will be offered to him, and all under Heaven will turn toward him."*

**He** said: *"A ruler who takes blame upon himself and bears the ill omens of the people can thus rule all under Heaven."*

**Pang** said: *"The Sage can be gentle and weak because he embodies the nature of water. To bear filth and ill omens is to accept impurities and humiliation—this is the Dao/Way of the wise."*

Straight words seem reversed.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"To bear the filth of the state is to be the sovereign of the land; to bear the ill omens of the state is to be the king of the world. This must be straight speech at first, seeming contrary to common sense, hence 'straight words seem reversed.'"*
**He** said: *"This is the speech of the upright. The world does not know it as such."*

**Pang** said: *"It is contrary to shallow understanding’s near-truth, yet aligns with the ultimate rectitude of the Dao/Way."*

---

Harmonizing great grievances,
**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"Great grievances are those opposing the ruler’s own body—passions and desires. Harmonize means to reconcile."*

This refers to the ruler’s desire to reconcile the people through instruction, so that none harbor passions and desires.
**He** said: *"Those who cook for others die, those who harm others are punished—yet they still retaliate in kind. There will always be lingering grievances."*

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"When establishing instruction for the people, one cannot avoid traces. These traces lead to grievances, hence 'there will always be lingering grievances.'"*

**He** said: *"Those who enforce punishments—human nature will inevitably cause grievances to extend even to the innocent."*

**Bi** said: *"If the ruler does not first clarify the principles of justice, great grievances will arise. Then, if he relies on virtue to reconcile them, the harm cannot be undone, hence 'there will always be lingering grievances.'"*

**Pang** said: *"If the ruler offers rites and ceremonies, yet the people do not respond, he will force them—then grievances begin. If he cannot restore order to its original state, yet still attempts to unite them in joy, the grievances will only grow worse. How can this be considered good?"*

**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"If lingering grievances exist, then it cannot be considered good."*

**He** said: *"If one man sighs in complaint, the ruler loses the hearts of the people. How can reconciling grievances be considered good?"*

**Pang** said: *"Though the intention may be good, the method itself is not."*

Thus the Sage holds the left token.
**He** said: *"In ancient times, the Sage held the left token, which was used to verify agreements and trust. Without written laws or documents, tokens were carved and matched to establish credibility."*

**Bi** said: *"The left token is what prevents grievances from arising."*

Yet he does not blame the people.
**Emperor Minghuang** said: *"The left token is the heart. The heart is the yin repository, matching with the external realm—hence it is called the left token."*

The Sage knows that establishing instruction will inevitably lead to grievances. If he explains them, lingering grievances will arise. Thus, he holds this heart, making it pure and still, and transforms the people through it. Then there will be no passions or desires, no need for punishments or blame, and naturally, the Dao/Way of non-action will be fulfilled.

**He** said: *"Only the token of trust is held below. The people are blamed for other matters."*

**Pang** said: *"The left token is taken from the people, the right token is given to the people. The left is without affairs, the right holds authority—thus the ancient division of tokens was like this. The Sage holds the left token, not engaging in affairs, yet all things come and align. I respond to their alignment alone. This is what is meant by 'responding and thus communicating with all under Heaven.'"*

Thus, the Sage is always burdened with the world’s blame yet never blames others. This is why he ultimately has no grievances.

*Zhuangzi* says: *"To gain is seen as belonging to others, to lose is seen as belonging to oneself."* Tang said: *"All under Heaven have guilt; the guilt lies upon my own body."* This is what is meant.

*Records* say: *"Those who offer oxen and horses hold the right token, as they present the tokens silently together."* Thus, it is known that the left token is held by those who bear blame.

*The Historical Records* say: *"The right token is used to hold people accountable."*

Thus, the virtuous ruler oversees tokens and trust.
**He** said: *"The virtuous ruler oversees only the tokens and trust."*

The **Bì** said: *"The virtuous person reflects upon the tokens of virtue, preventing resentment from arising before blaming others."*

The **Páng** said: *"The common people engage in affairs, responding to what harmonizes with them. The unvirtuous oversee only the enforcement of laws."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"'Oversee' means to govern. 'Enforcement' means to impose upon people. It is said that the virtuous ruler governs through the harmony of virtue, and thus people transform naturally. The unvirtuous ruler, however, establishes laws to impose upon people, and such laws bring harm—this is not yet good governance."*

The **Hé** said: *"The unvirtuous ruler betrays the tokens of trust and holds people accountable for their failures."*

The **Bì** said: *"'Enforcement' means to hold people accountable for their faults."*

The **Páng** said: *"'Enforcement' means to impose upon people, and when one seeks to impose upon all things, the obstacles become many. The Dao of Heaven has no favorites; it always aligns with the virtuous."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"To govern through the tokens of virtue is to maintain clarity and stillness; to govern through laws is to bring exhaustion and ruin. Heaven has no favorites—it aids only virtue. Thus, the sovereign must always strive for spontaneous transformation through non-action, never establishing laws to create affairs."*

The **Hé** said: *"The Dao of Heaven has no distinctions of near or far; it aligns only with the virtuous, meaning it aligns with those who govern through the tokens of virtue."*

The **Páng** said: *"Only Heaven has no favorites—it aids only the good, making clear that Heaven and the Sage share the same Way."*

---
**Chapter Eighty: Small States, Few People**

*"Small states, few people."*

The **Hé** said: *"Though the Sage governs a great state, he still regards it as small, practicing frugality without extravagance. Though the people are many, he treats them as if they were few, never burdening them."*

The **Bì** said: *"If a state is already small and its people few, it is still possible to return to antiquity. How much more so for a great state with many people? Thus, extolling the small state is auspicious."*

The **Páng** said: *"Small governance and few people gather the populace in sincerity and thickness. When a state is large and its people many, conflicts of interest arise, cunning and deceit flourish daily. Observe the people of great cities and crowded settlements—their honesty and guile differ greatly, and this is the proof."*

*"Let the people have implements of ten or a hundred, yet not use them."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"'Ten' means a group of ten; 'a hundred' means a group of a hundred. This chapter reveals that people are naturally harmonious and unassuming, possessing talents and implements fit to serve as leaders of tens or hundreds—but they are not used."*

The **Hé** said: *"Let the people each lead their households and groups of tens or hundreds, so that high and low do not encroach upon one another. 'Implements' refers to the tools of farmers, which are not used for conscription, nor to seize the people’s prime agricultural time."*

The **Bì** said: *"If the people, though possessing implements for tens or hundreds, are not used—what need is there to fear scarcity?"*

The **Páng** said: *"The implements of ten are those shared by ten people; the implements of a hundred are those shared by a hundred. Under governance of clarity and stillness, the aim is to let the people fulfill their natural inclinations without unnecessary labor, thus avoiding gatherings and assemblies. Hence, though implements of tens or hundreds exist, they are not used."*

*"Let the people hold life as precious,"*

The **Hé** said: *"If the ruler can promote the people’s well-being and remove their harms, letting each find their place, then the people will value life and avoid death."*

*"and not move far."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"With few thoughts and desires, they do not lightly squander their lives, rooted in their essence without seeking, hence they do not migrate far."*

The **Hé** said: *"When governance is not burdensome, the people remain settled in their occupations, thus they do not move far from their customary dwellings."*

The **Bì** said: *"If the people are not burdened, they treasure their own lives, not coveting wealth or paths, hence they remain in their homes, valuing life and not migrating far."*

The **Páng** said: *"Delighting in life and fulfilling nature, they value death and cherish their homeland, seeking nothing, hence they do not migrate far. In an age of chaos, the people are thin and affairs are many, while greed and desire overcome their love of life. The roots wither and the branches flourish, while covetousness extends beyond their due—thus they stumble into punishments and dangers as if walking on level ground, and their cart tracks and footprints crisscross the four directions. This is the extreme of disorder."*

*"Though they have boats and carriages, there is no need to ride them."*

The **Hé** said: *"In governance of clarity and non-action, there is no indulgence in extravagance, nor fondness for travel and amusement."*

*"Though they have armor and weapons, there is no need to display them."*

The **Hé** said: *"There is no resentment toward the world."*

The **Páng** said: *"When the people suffice within their natural allotments, there are no calamities of distant journeys or warfare."*

*"Let the people return to using knotted cords."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"Boats and carriages are for facilitating migration; armor and weapons are for waging war. Since there is no desire for these, there is no need to use or fear them. Thus, they return to the simplicity of the Three Sovereigns, using only knotted cords."*

The **Hé** said: *"Abandoning artifice and returning to simplicity, they act without deceit."*

The **Páng** said: *"With simple governance and sincere people, there is no need for written contracts."*

*"Let them find their food sweet,"*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"They do not crave flavors, so their food is always sweet."*

The **Hé** said: *"They find sweetness in their plain fare, not craving the hundred beasts."*

*"and their clothing beautiful."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"They do not indulge in embroidered fabrics, so their garments are all beautiful."*

The **Hé** said: *"They find beauty in their coarse clothing, not valuing the five colors."*

The **Páng** said: *"Sweet food and beautiful clothing—without effort, they are rich."*

*"Let their customs be settled,"*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"They do not adorn their dwellings, so their homes are settled."*

The **Hé** said: *"They find contentment in their thatched huts, not favoring ornate houses."*

*"and their occupations joyful."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"They do not corrupt their natural simplicity, so their customs are joyful."*

The **Hé** said: *"They delight in their simple and unadorned customs, not altering them."*

*"Neighboring states are in sight, and the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard between them."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"This speaks of their proximity."*

The **Hé** said: *"They are near one another."*

The **Páng** said: *"People fulfill their natural lives, thus they multiply and rejoice."*

*"Let the people reach old age and death without traveling far."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"This is the extreme of having no desires."*

The **Hé** said: *"They lack emotional attachments."*

The **Bì** said: *"They have no desires or cravings."*

The **Páng** said: *"Though near, they do not interact—having no external desires."*

*"This is governance that fulfills nature, hence the people also fulfill their nature."*

*"I have often examined the final chapters of the* Analects *and* Mencius*, where they all speak of the deeds of the Sage-kings Yáo, Shùn, Yǔ, and Tāng. It seems that if one applies this entire text to governance, its effects can be compared to theirs."*

The **Lǎo Zǐ**, the great Sage, encountered changes that aligned precisely with the time of returning to the origin and fulfilling nature. Therefore, he alone illuminated the meaning of **Dao** and **virtue**, using it to gather and restrain the scattered phenomena of the world—unifying them in the **Pú** (primordial simplicity).

If one applies his entire text to governance, then transforming the people and establishing customs would be its effect, as seen in this passage. Thus, the meaning of the *Classics* concludes here.

Yáng Zǐ composed *The Law of Speech*, which also ends with the words of the **Sage-kings** of **Táng** and **Yǔ**. Indeed, there is a method in the teachings of **Kǒng** and **Mèng**, and this text. Yet, Yáng Zǐ’s words, though truly applicable to the world, are hardly sufficient to compare with the deeds of the **Sages**—one may say he grasped their intent, but his speech exceeded it.

(Original: *信言不美章第八十一*)
**Faithful speech is not ornate.**

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"Faithful speech is the **Sage’s teaching**."*

Speech that is true and real does not conform to the tastes of the common people, hence it is not ornate.

The **Hé** said: *"Faithful speech is like its substance. Ornate speech is simple and unadorned."*

The **Bì** said: *"Its substance lies in its simplicity."*

The **Páng** said: *"Faithful speech is essential to the **Dao**. The **Dao’s** words, when spoken, are plain and without relish—what ornamentation could there be? Ornate speech is not faithful."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"Ornate speech is a substitute for teaching."* Speech that is sweet and pleasing appeals to the tastes of the common people, hence it is not faithful.

The **Hé** said: *"Excessively ornate speech is elaborate and flowery. Faithlessness is embellishment and deception, full of emptiness."*

The **Bì** said: *"Its origin lies in simplicity."*

The **Páng** said: *"When one speaks of phenomena apart from the **Dao**, even if it pleases the shallow ears of the unlearned, it is not profound discourse. Speech is like wind and waves—why seek ornamentation? The good do not argue. The **Míng Huáng** said: *"The good manifest in action, not in argument."* The **Hé** said: *"The good cultivate themselves with the **Dao**, not with rhetorical flourishes."* The **Páng** said: *"Speech may be close, but its meaning is distant—no need for elaborate words."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"The skilled are not good."* Clever and convoluted argumentation renders one unworthy.

The **Hé** said: *"The skilled are those who use clever words."* The unworthy suffer from their tongues.

The **Páng** said: *"The earth yields jade, but digging exhausts its mountain; water yields pearls, but turbidity befogs its depths. A mouth that speaks much loses its life."*

The **Páng** said: *"Speech serves only to elucidate the **Dao**. The essential is not to be verbose—why indulge in much talk?"*
**Kǒng Zǐ** said: *"Words suffice when meaning is conveyed."*

**The wise are not indiscriminately learned.**

The **Hé** said: *"The wise refer to those who grasp the **Dao**—indiscriminate learning is clinging to a single principle."*

The **Bì** said: *"The extreme lies in unity."*

The **Páng** said: *"The extreme should lie in the most subtle essence—what need is there for indiscriminate learning? One who is indiscriminately learned does not truly know."*

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"The wise are those who have awakened understanding; the indiscriminately learned are those who have heard much."*

The **Hé** said: *"The indiscriminately learned see and hear much, but the unwise lose the true essence."*

The **Páng** said: *"Drowned in the multitude of phenomena, they cannot return to simplicity. The most foolish among them—where could true wisdom be found?"*

**The Sage has no accumulation.**

The **Míng Huáng** said: *"Accumulation means clinging to words and obstructing teachings, having fixed attachments."* The **Sage** awakens to speech and forgets it, understands teachings and discards them—unbound by any fixation, hence no accumulation.

The **Bì** said: *"Without private possession, only goodness is given—trusting in all things."*

The **Páng** said: *"The **Sage’s Dao** flows without direction, yet the **Sage** remains ever without obstruction. Thus, with utter simplicity, they fulfill the demands of all things. If one accumulates, the gains are few—how could they transform and govern all?"* This is the clear understanding that the wise are not indiscriminately learned.

**The more one gives to others, the more one possesses.**

The **Hé** said: *"The more one gives to others in bestowing **virtue** and transforming customs, the more one’s own **virtue** increases."*

The **Bì** said: *"This is what things revere."*

The **Páng** said: *"To give to others means to apply oneself to governance and the world. Following the natural course of things and benefiting them, then one’s **Dao** is not diminished, and one’s deeds are ever more expansive."*

**Emperor Xuānzōng said:** "This is the **Dao/Way** of the **Sage**—its nature is inexhaustible. The **Sage**, though not hoarding or obstructing words of instruction, yet entices the common and vulgar with the **law/flavor** of the **Dao/Way**, exhaustively bestowing it upon others. To the **Sage’s** serene and tranquil nature, this brings no depletion; rather, it only grows clearer and more luminous. Hence the saying: *the more one gives to others, the more one possesses.* **‘Have’** refers to the **Sage’s** own clarity of nature; **‘many’** refers to the outer brilliance that increases.

**The Hé said:** "If one gives wealth and bribes in alms to others, the wealth becomes ever more abundant—like the light of the sun and moon, which knows no end."

**The Bì said:** "This is what things follow."

**The Páng said:** "To give to others is to impart the **Dao/Way**. To impart the **Dao/Way** to others is like Heaven nurturing all things: I have never expended myself, yet things daily grow in number. Since it is said that there is no accumulation, it is further made clear that one can thus satisfy all things. Only by having no accumulation can one satisfy them all. The **Dao/Way** of Heaven is to benefit without harming.

**The Hé said:** "Heaven generates all things, cherishes and nourishes them, allowing them to grow and flourish without harm."

**The Bì said:** "It is ever in motion, creating and sustaining all."

**The Páng said:** "Heaven is the progenitor of all things, ever fostering them with benevolent care. How could it harbor intent to harm? This is the **Dao/Way** of trustworthy speech—if it is beautiful here, it will harm there. The **Dao/Way** of the **Sage** is to act without contention. The **Emperor Xuānzōng** said: ‘The **Dao/Way** of Heaven benefits all things without harming—this is to clarify the **Dao/Way** of the **Sage** in action and expansive benefit, ever bestowing it upon others, hence no contention.’

**The Hé said:** "The **Sage** follows Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, and all actions and transformations are complete. They do not contend with the lower ranks for fame or renown, thus preserving their **Sage’s** true merit."

**The Bì said:** "They align with Heaven’s benefit, never causing injury."

**The Páng said:** "With one breath of **qi**, all things are fulfilled. The **Sage** embodies the great **Dao/Way** in action, moving at times swift, at times slow—how could they harbor thoughts of contention? Indeed, only thus do they establish words and transmit **laws**. They adapt to the times and follow **principles**, doing just what is fitting, not for mere argument’s sake. Yet they ultimately rely on this sentence: truly desiring to embody the **Dao/Way** of **virtue/power** and **moral integrity**, nothing surpasses *acting without contention.* The *Lǎozǐ*’s **sutra/scripture** concludes at the **eighty-first chapter**, this chapter summarizing the intent of his composition. It is also because *Nán Huá* [Southern Flower, i.e., *Zhuāngzǐ*] ends with the **Sage**’s death, and yet there is further *Tianxià* [Heaven and Earth, i.e., *Tianxia*], one chapter, clarifying the **dharma/principles** of **Dao/Way** and **technique/art**—right and wrong—so as to leave behind the traces of their compilation.

**Postscript:**
The writings of *Lǎozǐ* have long been transmitted in the world, their words subtle, their meaning profound, yet none could fully grasp them. Scholars who do not clearly comprehend and penetrate to their depths cannot fathom the **Dao/Way** of **virtue/power**, life, and nature—its boundaries are difficult to measure.

*Lǎozǐ* did not intend to construct lofty theories to bewilder the world. The **Dao/Way**’s ultimate essence is mysterious and obscure, even the **Sage** struggles to name its bounds. When the **Dao/Way** and its techniques were scattered, if one did not reveal their origins and outline their broad principles, then the world and future generations would have those who are foolish yet unenlightened—lost and adrift, without anchor or guard. They would not know the **Dao/Way**’s fundamental source and become inverted citizens.

Thus, compelled, I forcefully articulate these words to clarify. The **Dao/Way** is vast, filling all of Heaven and Earth without limit; it is small, entering the minutest crevices without gap. Its profundity opens as the gateway to all marvels; its coarseness governs the home, the state, and the world—it is nowhere absent.

There have been three who previously commented: **Hé Shànggōng**, **Emperor Xuānzōng**, and **Wáng Bì**. Though their interpretations differ in what they adopt or reject, each has its strengths. Ultimately, they all seek to explore the **Dao/Way**’s fundamental essence.

In recent times, **Wáng Páng** delved deeply into the study of the **Dao/Way** of **virtue/power** and life and nature, further elucidating *Lǎozǐ*’s intent. He penetrated the subtle and illuminated the hidden, forming a unique interpretation, making the **eighty-first chapter** yet more apparent in the world.

Yet scholars of the world regard *Lǎozǐ*’s writings as mere empty, useless words, seldom paying attention. They cling to shallow, vulgar opinions, thinking they have attained understanding, yet they truly do not grasp the **Dao/Way**’s fundamental essence, which was clarified only by *Lǎozǐ*. His **sutra/scripture** was fully known only through the interpretations of these scholars. This is not easily heard by the common learner.

**Magistrate Zhāng** [public official’s title], profoundly understood the **Dao/Way** of **virtue/power**, life, and nature. He cultivated himself through literature and art, and as a guardian and teacher, he lamented that those who held the **scripture** did not know the **Dao/Way**. Thus, he commanded the students in the **school/academy** to study these four interpretations, neither adding nor detracting, and compiled them for circulation in his time, broadening their teachings. So that those who inherit learning might know that *Lǎozǐ*’s writings are not merely empty, fanciful words—his research is profound and refined, all capable of reaching the ultimate truth. Its core is for self-cultivation; its residue extends to governance of the world and the state. Thus, learning is far more than mere supplementary aid.

I humbly follow the teachings of my predecessors, fortunate to receive their guidance directly. Therefore, I merely request to record the year of this work, lest its transmission be forgotten.

In the year **Yuánfú** the First, on the first day of the tenth month, **Liáng Jiào** (my humble name), formerly the **judge of military affairs** in **Qián Yīng Prefecture**, respectfully composed this preface.
