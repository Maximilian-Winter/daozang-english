**The Dao Gives Birth to Heaven and Earth**
Before the primordial chaos divided, the Dao already was—
Formless and colorless, without emotion or intent.
Naturally nurturing, it brought forth heaven and earth:
The Way of Heaven, light and clear; the Way of Earth, serene and still.

**Heaven and Earth Give Birth to Man**
The Dao begot heaven and earth when names were yet unspoken,
Parting yin and yang to establish the Five Phases.
Man stands amidst them, most numinous of the ten thousand things,
Born of heaven and earth, shaped by the Dao.

**Man Receives Yin and Yang**
Of the Three Powers—Heaven, Earth, and Man—all share the same primordial darkness.
Man is endowed with the numinous radiance of precelestial unity.
This darkness, embodied, is called the Dao by day,
Resonating with heaven, earth, and the divine spirits.

**The One Gives Birth to the Three**
Beyond the One True, no truth exists;
The ancestral darkness, spiritually attuned, pervades this body.
The Dao, undivided, generates the Three in wondrous function:
Original essence, original qi, and original spirit.

**The Three Treasures of the Human Body**
Original essence, original qi, and original spirit—
The Three, formless yet manifest in form.
When their operation is mastered and transmitted, the True becomes visible,
Radiant and boundless, perfectly clear.

**The One Without Form Interconnects**
Thunder arises from the transformation of precelestial darkness;
All the immortals and sages of the heavens share this same truth.
The singular darkness within my body summons and responds,
Of one ancestry, one lineage, intimately bound as bone and flesh.

**Uniting Mind with Spirit**
Where the true mind stirs, there lies the mechanism of thunder.
Spirit merges with spirit—how wondrous and strange!
Here alone is no distinction,
Like a magnet drawing iron, never apart.

**The Dharma Is the Mind Itself**
Beyond this mind, no dharma exists;
Incantations, talismans, and diagrams seldom align with truth.
When the mind is true, what wondrous function can it not perform?
A single point of numinous radiance directs the original spirit.

**The Spirit Can Reach Heaven**
The original spirit presents a sealed missive,
A beam of cold light piercing the great void.
It travels directly to the Jade Capital and Golden Gates,
Where celestial grace descends like a shooting star upon the heavenly thoroughfare.

**Rebuking Heaven with a Shout**
Shouting into the void, issuing commands with a roar—
Who recognizes the original spirit as the summoned messenger?
Heaven is high, the stars distant—how could they hear?
Let them be, with their "this" and "that," their "and" and "also."

**Summoning Thunder with Golden Light**
Golden light blazes, illuminating the Thunder Citadel;
A million thunder soldiers obey the command.
No talismans, no incantations, no mudras are needed—
In drought, it brings rain; in rain, it brings clear skies.

**Deluded Practices**
Failing to grasp the mechanism of yin and yang’s opening and closing,
All imagined techniques and applications are but folly.
A thousand thousand thunder talismans burned to ash—
Yet not a single drop of rain has ever fallen.

**True Thought Subdues Demons**
Where lies the work of subduing demons?
Within, the original spirit abides in stillness and stability.
When the sword of wisdom is brandished, gods and ghosts bow;
Thus, calamities and harms vanish of themselves.

**Deluded Minds Invite Ghostly Deception**
Deluded thoughts swirl, losing all truth;
Talismans, diagrams, and incantations waste the spirit.
Ghosts and spirits, seeing this, laugh in mockery,
Hurling stones and bricks to harm instead.

**The Ancestral Darkness Is the Sun’s Essence**
The precelestial ancestral darkness is the sun’s purest essence,
Refining yin souls to a single numinous nature.
The Ninefold Mysterious Work is accomplished in an instant,
As yin and yang unite to conceive the embryonic immortal.

**Discerning True Yin and Yang**
Failing to recognize true yin and true yang,
One might as well bathe in water or scorch with fire.
If the single point of numinous radiance remains unclear,
What benefit is there in delivering lost souls?

**Nanchang Is Not the Mind**
The Mysterious Pass, a single aperture, holds yin and yang;
Heart and kidneys are not the domains of water and fire.
I urge refining masters to lift their gaze—
Do not mistake the mind’s palace for Nanchang.

**The Dharma of Universal Salvation**
The work of universal salvation differs still:
Golden light blazes, illuminating the nether realms.
A single grain of millet pearl hangs suspended in emptiness,
As the Supreme Ultimate returns to the Ultimateless.

**Seeking What Cannot Be Sought**
Ignorant of the master of one’s own original qi,
One vainly seeks heaven’s response in empty space.
It is like riding an ox in search of the ox—
What is there to say to such people?

**Failing to Recognize the Original Spirit**
Summoning generals begins with a thunderous command,
The command’s roar awakens my original spirit.
Why then do they not see the original spirit’s face?
Only because people of this age have forgotten their true nature.

**The Seal Must Be the Mind’s Seal**
The mind-seal is transmitted with cause and reason;
Today’s people stamp with wood, unaware of the mystery.
Where the mind-seals of the patriarchs align,
Each radiates brilliance, piercing the nine heavens.

**A Single Point of Numinous Radiance**
The subtlety of talismanic arts begins with effort,
Gathering at the tip of the brush to inscribe the talisman.
Clinging to form, imagining, performing mudras—
All that remains is ink and cinnabar.

**The Precelestial Script**
The head of the talisman’s inscription must be in celestial seal-script,
Originally written by the Sovereign Lord with his brush.
The characters of Cangjie, of the postcelestial world,
Are but delusions, bewildering the foolish.

**Deluded Yin and Yang**
Swallowing and spewing yin and yang within talismanic practice,
Heart and kidneys wax and wane in darkness and redness.
A single qian and kun encompass such vastness—
How can these petty tricks ever succeed?

**The Single Point Between the Kidneys**
Between the two kidneys, a single point of brightness—
Fools guard it, seeking spiritual communion.
Who knows this place is all yin qi?
The true yang’s radiance lies ten thousand leagues away.

**The Original Spirit Below the Heart**
Some say below the heart lies an empty chamber,
Where essence, qi, and original spirit gather.
How easily fools are deceived—
They do not recognize the true master.

**The Gallbladder Is Not the Thunder Palace**
Mistaking the viscera for the Thunder Palace,
Anger swells, stirring shock and awe.
Once the crystal vase is shattered,
When has thunder’s roar ever been heard?

**Pointing to Thunder**
Where the single yang arises, the earth’s thunder revives—
The external kidneys are not thunder’s dwelling.
Foul and turbid, even sages find repentance difficult;
Such acts will surely incur thunder’s judgment.

**Failing to Distinguish True Yang**
Heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, gallbladder—
With *xu*, *he*, *yan*, *xi*, *hu*, and *chui*, one draws them in.
These are the yin and yang qi of parents’ postcelestial bodies—
How can they be used to pray for clear skies or rain?

**Seven Things Purely Yin**
Tears, saliva, fluids, essence, qi, blood, and humor—
All seven are yin, utterly without benefit.
Within the body, only one yin and one yang exist—
Yet how many in the rivers and lakes fail to recognize this?

**Foul Qi Offends the True**
Some speak of the three-tenths of an inch below the navel,
Where golden light is said to reside in practice.
Who knows this place is filled with yin’s turbid qi?
When activated, its filth is unbearable to hear.

**Seeming Yet Not So**
Falsely claiming a single aperture lies between the brows,
Penetrating three-tenths of an inch deep—how absurd!
Misleading the world’s people is truly laughable,
Like mistaking a brick for gold.

**Mistaking the Postcelestial**
The navel wheel and kidneys connect behind—
Both hollow, both entirely postcelestial.
If one asks where the wondrous precosmic lies,
Only meeting a perfected master can convey.

**Thunder Strikes Unceasing**
Thunder’s use, thunder’s might—how fierce its wrath!
Yet some wait for stars to halt, the sun and moon to pause.
If such celestial secrets were so easily divined,
Why invoke the arts to pray for rain or shine?

**The Deviant Bewilders the True**
How many lack the Dao-eye’s clarity,
Commanding pine spirits to manifest at will?
Only because the body lacks a sovereign lord
Do yin souls falsely borrow names to feign their power.

**Discerning the Essential**
One divine general serves a hundred schools—
Most are fabrications of their founders’ hands.
After years pass, much proves false:
Can incantations and talismanic water truly work?

**Dual Mastery in Practice**
Daoist arts cling to incantations and talismans,
Yet both must be upheld by the Dao’s subtlety.
When precosmic mystery’s work is complete,
Incantations and talismans may fade to naught.

**Dao as the Foundation of Method**
Practicing the Great Dao aligns with the precosmic;
Incantations, talismans—all are but mystery.
When the Supreme Dao vanishes into the ineffable,
Talismans and incantations are but empty forms.

**The Myriad Methods Return to One**
The Dao arises from the One—what doubt remains?
It may be wuwei or youwei as needed.
All methods inherently return to this single source—
Why distinguish between Orthodox Unity and Pure Subtlety?

**Creation Lies Within Me**
Though forms differ, their essence is not black nor white;
One must labor where kinship is closest.
The human body, in essence, mirrors heaven and earth—
Yin and yang’s transformations all belong to me.

**Sitting in Stolid Emptiness**
Mindless, stolidly sitting for years,
One fancies immortality already attained.
Yet without grasping the dragon’s hum or tiger’s roar,
Such empty sitting is but futile.

**Yin and Yang Interdepend**
Within a hollow stone lies hidden white jade;
Though its light may dazzle the eye,
The Great Yin fundamentally receives the Great Yang’s essence—
From the waxing crescent on the eighth to fullness on the sixteenth.

**Methods Breed Slander**
Meant to guide fellow disciples from delusion,
The superior root grasps the subtle at a glance.
Yet if this is taught to the foolish and blind,
Slander and wrath arise—all is discord.

**The Ode on Illuminating Truth and Dispelling Delusion Concludes**
