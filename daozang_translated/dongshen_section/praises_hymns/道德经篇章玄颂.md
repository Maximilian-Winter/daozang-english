**The Mystic Praise of the Dao/Way and Its Virtue: Preface to the Mystic Praise of the Dao/Way and Its Virtue**

By **Song Luan**, newly appointed as the **Defense Judge of Yingzhou**, **Junior Official of the Great Justice Bureau**, and **Censorate Inspector**, humbly offering this work.

I have heard that the pure and simple nature originates from the natural, and the source of wisdom springs from cultivation. Thus, it is known that knotting cords to mark numbers and refining civilization could be practiced in the age of **Great Antiquity**. Yet, the emotions of joy and sorrow arise from the **Five Phases** and transform with the **Harmonious Qi** of moderation. Once language and writing were established, the distinction between the virtuous and the foolish emerged. Even before **Emperor Yao** and **Emperor Shun**, wars and conflicts began, yet they still followed the **Dao/Way**. At the time of **King Tang** and **King Wu**, the **Dao/Way** was neglected as they pursued conquest. Afterward, the **fiefdoms were divided like scattered stones**, and the **pao tree** bestowed favors—those who aided their rulers sought glory, while schemers plotted for power. The decline of the **Zhou dynasty** began when the king hunted at **Henyang**, where the **Jin Wen** alliance was formed, and the **Heavenly King** attended the gathering. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* discreetly omitted this, simply recording "the king hunted at **Henyang**."

As the **Zhou dynasty** weakened, debates arose over **gaining worthy men** and **losing worthy men**, and discussions of **flourishing states** and **declining states** proliferated. All sought clever arguments, their tongues twisting in vain. Some refused **yellow gold** yet demanded it, while others scorned **white jade** yet coveted it. **Su Qin** adorned his family by wearing the **seal of office**, **Zhang Lu** strengthened his state to erase his shame, **Li Si** ascended to high rank, and **Bu Wei** sighed in obscurity. In that era, the **eloquent persuasions** of a single moment could bring glory, while **tenfold honors** were grasped in an instant. Yet they failed to grasp that harming the **noble qi**, chasing fleeting fame—initially thriving in prosperity, they ultimately perished in ruin.

Then came the **hunted stag** and the **soaring dragon**. The **Qin dynasty** collapsed, its chariots crossing the **Sea Bridge** amid **blue waves**. The **Han Emperor** rose, his **sword of destiny** leaning against the **Azure Sky**. As **civilization flourished** and **culture thrived**, the **Four Cardinal Directions** were bound by **writings and governance**, and all living beings felt the **transformative power** of the **Dao/Way**, finding ease in its flow. The **Eight Seas** became clear mirrors, and the **Nine Regions** settled in stillness—deceitful words could not prevail, while the **authentic and profound** winds were restored.

Thus arose **Yang Zi Yun**, **Dongfang Shuo**, **Li Yuan**, and **Yuan An**, all like **radiant stars** and **exalted talents**, their fragrance spreading like **orchids and osmanthus**. They indulged in **classics and lore**, yet delayed their ambitions. For they understood that **Su Qin’s wearing of the seal** to honor his family was inferior to **Yang Zi Yun’s taking up arms** to serve the **Han**; **Zhang Lu’s strengthening of his state** to erase his shame was not as noble as **Dongfang Shuo’s feigning humility** by offering his flesh; **Li Si’s ascent to prominence** was less worthy than **Li Yuan’s perpetual refusal** of lavish rewards; and **Bu Wei’s lament in obscurity** paled compared to **Yuan An’s quiet retreat** to his thatched cottage.

They did not harbor **vain and deceitful thoughts**, but only recognized the **allotted fates** of poverty and wealth. When used, they shone like **pearls returned to their streams**, radiant and resplendent; when abandoned, they lay hidden like **jade buried in mountains**, yet still retaining their **gentle warmth**. With **measured advancement and retreat**, they found **ease in the Dao/Way**, ever serene in their own being. They contemplated the **mystic origins** of the **Supreme Good** and followed the **principles of the Great Changes**, avoiding **excessive striving**, and drawing near to **tranquil harmony**.

In reflection of the **Four Virtuous Ones** whose fame endures through ages, I recall the **retreat to the Yan Platform** and the **plots by the Wei River**. Though I deem myself **base and unworthy**, I dare to speak and compose, only to **aspire to the lofty teachings** and **fan the true winds**. I seek to **promote the Four Virtues** to calm the **four cardinal regions**, using the **Three Treasures** to **comfort the people**. All should return to **simplicity and purity**, casting off **superficial adornments**.

Thus, I boldly interpret the *Dao/Way Dejing*, weaving **Ba-style songs**, following each chapter’s theme to **chant its essence**. Sometimes, I divide a single line for **separate verses**; other times, I compose an entire poem to **narrate its meaning**. Though not refined like the *Sao* or *Ya*, I still admire the **mystic subtleties**, sincerely offering my **devoted heart** to those who **discern the profound**.

**Volume One: Mystic Praise of the Dao/Way Dejing**
**Chapter One: "The Dao/Way That Can Be Spoken Of"**
Do not confuse the **Dao/Way** with the **True Dao/Way**,
Nor tarnish the **Great Name** with common speech.
The *Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way*;
*The name that can be named is not the eternal name.*

Only when **desires are abandoned** can the **pure and simple** be preserved,
For **action and striving** will always **regret cleverness**.
The *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
*If a person can always abandon desire, they may perceive the Dao/Way’s essence.*
*Essence refers to a single, unclouded mind.*

The **mind’s source** is straight and clear, its **Dao/Way** pure and still,
While **emotions** are crooked, needing **sweeping and leveling**.
Only through **diligent practice** can one truly **penetrate and understand**,
Yet **clarity and turbidity** are already born within.

The *Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*Without the **Dao/Way of Non-Action**, the beginning of heaven and earth would not exist.*
*Beginning refers to the **Dao/Way’s origin**.*

**Chapter Two: "The World Knows the Dao/Way"**
Cultivate **virtue/power** to leave behind **glory and wealth**,
Yet **Emperor Yi** and **Emperor Kang** achieved **great deeds** through **non-action**.
Do good without **boasting**, yet **reach the utmost goodness**,
Achieve success without **taking credit**, for it is **distinctive merit**.
The *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
*Those who do not dare to rest in their **virtue/power** yet still cultivate it—*
*They forget their deeds yet their merit remains,*
*They do not cling yet are not abandoned.*

If one can **nurture the Three Treasures** in **stillness and tranquility**,
They will **attain the Dao/Way of wordless instruction**,
**Establishing a name** while **preserving life** is worthy of admiration,
Yet even a **simple boat** cannot be detained by the **Five Lakes’ winds**.
The *Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*Only those who achieve success*
*Do not dwell in their rank.*

**Fan Li** achieved success and **fulfilled his name**,
Then **vanished into the Five Lakes**.

**Chapter Three: "Not Exalting the Worthy"**
To **abolish superficiality** and **not exalt the worthy**,
The *Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*Do not exalt the worthy.*

Instead, **abandon gold and jade** to the **mountains and streams**.
The *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
*The ruler does not indulge in rare delicacies—*
*Gold is cast into the mountains,*
*Jade is discarded into the streams.*

**Merit and fame** are not **boasted of**, returning to **simplicity and purity**,
**Lusts and cravings** are **extinguished**, merging with **nature**.
The *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
*Do not seek merit and fame, return to nature.*
*Again, it says:*
*Eliminate lusts and cravings,*
*Abandon vexation and confusion.*

The **virtuous scholar** can **embrace simplicity**,
Yet even the **beautiful woman** cannot **compare to rustic elegance**.
The *Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
*Discard the **music of Zheng**,*
*Keep distant from **flatterers**.*

With **empty mind and full belly**, diligently **cultivate the Dao/Way**,
The *Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*Empty its mind,*
*Fill its belly.*

Obtaining **effortless action** is the **mystic realm**.
**Chapter Four: Dao’s Purity**—
Conceal reputation, treasure **virtue/power** to preserve the body,
Do not let idle worries disturb the **true Dao/Way**.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
*The Dao hides its name, conceals its reputation—*
*Its use lies within.*

As an official in **Lacquer Garden**, **Zhuangzi** tempered sharpness,
Guarding **Hangu Pass**, he blended with the common dust.
*The Dao/Way* says:
*Dull its sharpness.*
*Again, it says:*
*Blend with the dust.*

**Zhuangzi** served as **Lacquer Garden’s** keeper,
**Yin Zheng** as **Hangu Pass’s** warden.

Calmly mingling with the world like clear water,
His years extended like the **Great Mulberry Tree**.

Before **Xuanlao’s** birth, he preserved **tranquility**,
Just as the **Qishu Tree** steadies **Eternal Spring**.

*The Dao/Way* says:
*I do not know whose child he was,*
*Before **Xuanlao’s** birth.*
*Again, it comments:*
*Those who endure today*
*Are those who can remain tranquil and serene,*
*Free from toil,*
*Seeking to guide others in **cultivating the body** and **embracing the Dao/Way**.*

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth’s Impartiality**—
Heaven and Earth bestow **mercy**, equally nurturing all things,
Yet they regard humans as **yellow dogs**—seemingly without favor.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
*Heaven and Earth give birth to myriad things,*
*Yet humans are most precious.*
*They view them like **worthless grass** or **beasts**,*
*Demanding no repayment.*

**Empty and unobstructed**, life flourishes naturally,
**Emotions and desires** forgotten—**purity** remains.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
*Between Heaven and Earth lies **emptiness**,*
*Where **vast qi** flows freely,*
*Thus all things arise spontaneously.*
*If one eliminates **emotions and desires**,*
*Moderates **appetites**,*
*Cleanses the **Five Zang**,*
*The **spirit** will dwell there.*

Cherish **qi**, nourish **jing**—**virtue/power** must be guarded,
Preserve the body, dispel **afflictions**—**truth** lies in few words.

*The Dao/Way* says:
*Many words lead to exhaustion,*
*Better to **embrace centrality**.*
*Again, it comments:*
*Better to **guard virtue/power within**,*
*Nurture the **spirit** and **qi**,*
*Cherish silence.*

Thus, contemplating **mystical stillness** to fathom subtle truths,
One must seek those who **cultivate a tranquil heart** to discuss.

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit**—
**Round and pure**, it bears **thick vitality**—
The **root of all things** lies in the **Dark Feminine’s Gate**, the **Land of Immortality**.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
*The **Land of Immortality** lies in the **Dark Feminine**.*
*Playful (Xuan) is Heaven—*
*In humans, the **nose**.*
*Feminine (Pìn) is Earth—*
*In humans, the **mouth**.*

Boldly emerging from the **mundane dust**, nothing is lost,
In stillness, **true qi** harmonizes—**relaxation** unfolds.

When the **Six Emotions** dissolve like ice melting,
The **Five Natures** align—**orange fragrance** blooms.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
*The **Five Natures** are **ghosts of the day** (arcana),*
*The **Six Emotions** are **ghosts of the night** (vitality).*
*If one eliminates the **Six Emotions** and purifies the **Five Natures**,*
*Then the **Dark Feminine’s Gate** is attained.*

**Yanluo’s Child**—
Great as a **bullet**, yellow as an **orange**,
Emerging from the **Jade Pool**, entering the **Golden Chamber**.

When applied, its **merit** is fulfilled—
One will naturally meet the **Emperor of Emptiness** at the **forked path**.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
*The use of the **Dark Feminine** is endless and subtle.*

「When applied, its use is without contrivance—
Thus no labor is exerted.

**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth’s Enduring Dao/Way**
Heaven and Earth stretch boundless, their logic profound and subtle,
Self-effacement alone reveals the hidden principle.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
Heaven and Earth nurture life—**virtue/power** vast and manifold,
Yet endure eternally because they draw from the Dao/Way,
Not boasting of their creative function.

The outer body thus attains longevity and firmness,
Yet selflessness brings all goodness to fruition.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
Place others before yourself.
Again it says:
The outer body forgotten, the heart serene—
Only then does the body endure.

The **caterpillar** bends, buried in mud, concealing its might,
The **jade** hides in deep valleys, yet radiance remains secret.

If one upholds the **Way’s** boundless, selfless transformation,
Let not the **active mind** stray from the Dao/Way.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
The sage is without self, yet enriched—
Thus their **virtue/power** is fulfilled.

**Chapter Eight: Nourishing Above Like Water**
The highest **virtue/power** is like water’s nature—gentle,
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *The highest **virtue/power** is like water.*
Yet it cannot be obstructed by the **lowly and hungry**.

偶穿积霭离幽壑，

「What then of the willows drooping toward the Imperial Canal?
Water’s beneficence flows, balancing all things,
Yet ever returns—never trapped by a lone boat’s drift.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *Water benefits all things.*
Square or round, it adapts to vessels’ form,
Refining its currents through wisdom’s art;
No need for Qin’s emperors to ride the sea—
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
In all affairs, to act with natural ease,
Like water’s flow—square or round, shaped by its vessel,
Unbound by things, yet ever in accord.
**Chapter Nine: Holding Fullness Like the Void**
The emptiest white is heart’s truest state—
Fullness is what one must shun.
Do not let high rank corrupt your natural grace.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *Fullness leads to loss, yet stopping is better.*
To hold what is full is to invite its fall—
Better to cease than to be overthrown.
Again it says: *Wealth and honor bring arrogance,
And ruin comes from one’s own hand.*

Sun Heng preserved his fortune through humility,
Hao Qin held fast to legacy’s grace.
Gongsun Hong, in quiet virtue, welcomed guests,
Yet prized modesty—thus his wealth increased.
Changsha Wang Wu’s descendants, too, by virtue kept,
Their honor passed through careful, steadfast hands.

Yet see the carriage-riders lost in endless schemes,
Who dream of peach groves, not the Three Pure Ones.
Fan Li and Zhang Liang, though clad in rank’s display,
Never forgot the Dao/Way’s path.
To float the lake and fast from grain—
Both left their glory, yet their names remain bright.
Fan Li drifted on the lake, Zhang Liang starved his flesh.
**Chapter Ten: Embracing the Spirit’s Essence**
Hold fast to One—let not the body stray.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *Can one embrace the One and not depart?*
Love the people, raise the land—yet act without design.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
To nurture all, to govern with care,
Can one do so without interference?
Then must one transform through selflessness.»

「。
　　The Three Spirits at peace extend life’s span,
Yet Four Reachings’ clarity they fail to see.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
When Spirits rest, the Dao/Way’s *qi* flows undisturbed,
And peace of mind prolongs both life and years.
Again it says: *Can one be bright and Four-Reaching yet know nothing?*

Guard single-mindedly the Spirit’s Essence and preserve the vast *qi*,
Yet once distinctions arise, the childlike innocence is lost.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
To focus solely on the boundless *qi*,
And rule with gentle harmony—
If one can remain as innocent as a child,
Without clinging to dual distinctions.

When deeds are done, let not the axe be raised—
Thus virtue’s depth is manifest.
Only then does one lay the foundation for Sun’s strategy through ages.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
The Dao/Way nurtures all things,
Grows vast yet never severs—
It serves as vessel and instrument.
Again it says: *Since it does not rule as sovereign,*
Those who can thus remain—
Are said to possess the profound virtue of the Dao/Way.

**Chapter Thirty: The Thirty Spokes**
Empty as the hub, yet one with the Dao’s mystery,
The thirty spokes fulfill their function with depth.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
Ancient chariots had thirty spokes,
Following the cycles of the moon.
All converging at the hub—
The hub, with its hollow core,
Where all spokes are gathered.
To govern the self, one must purge emotion and desire,
Empty the Five Viscera—
Then the Spirit returns to its source.
To govern the state, one must gather all under a single strength,
And uphold the mighty.
Clarify its principle:
The clay vessel, formed yet empty, holds its capacity,
Windows and doors open—
The Dao/Way is found within.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
Clay vessels are shaped from earth,
Yet their emptiness allows them to contain.
Again it says: *The vessel’s hollowness receives and holds.*
Again it says: *Windows and doors, though empty,*
Let people observe and pass through,
Illustrating the boundless use of the Dao/Way.

Unsoiled by right and wrong, one nourishes the True Nature in obscurity,
Yet laments the world’s desires while tuning the Spirit’s strings in silence.
With one uncluttered mind, all minds submit—
Only then does the mind of transcendent ease emerge.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
The void shapes the manifest.
**Chapter Five: The Five Colors**
If one can debase the eyes and dissolve the Six Passions,
Then the belly’s needs alone shall govern—
Like a horse adjusted to its harness.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
Thus the Sage acts for the belly, not the eyes.
For the belly means to purge the Six Passions,
And debasing the eyes means no reckless gazing.

When the mouth grows wanton, green with envy for refined feasts,
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
The Five Flavors make the mouth reckless.
Reckless, it speaks in vain—
Lost to the Dao/Way.
When the heart runs wild, it’s as though galloping after gold in the hunt.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
To chase and hunt across fields,
Makes the heart grow mad.
Again it says:
To race through worldly affairs,
Clinging to action—
Like the hunter’s relentless pursuit,
Only seeking slaughter,
The heart follows, chasing after gains,
Still while thinking—
This is the madness of the heart.

To rise above dust, one must follow the Heavenly Crane’s path,
Yet drowning in俗， one must awaken to sever the Dao’s strings.
Abandon desire and uphold the True Doctrine’s simplicity—
Without dwelling in caves or valleys, one finds true ease.

**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation as Startling**
The Venerable Master descends with clear intent:
Honor and humiliation—
Both are cause for alarm.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
Honor and humiliation as startling.
Why sully oneself in lowly station?
When merit is earned, let it fade—
And yield to greater glory.
Gan Tang bore the cauldron to aid the enlightened ruler,
Fan Li fled in a humble boat to preserve his name.
Yi Yin bore the cauldron for Gan Tang—
His deeds were vast and his aid profound.
Fan Li took the humble boat and fled—
Forever safeguarding his merit and fame.
To curb worldly dust and expand vast aid,
When deeds are done, retire to preserve one’s path.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**
Xi Yi, the Obscure, and the Minute—
All three merge as one.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
The Obscure, the Minute, and the Vast—
These three blend into unity.
In motion, endless as the cord’s pull,
Yet cannot be named—
Beyond the hues of *xuan* and *huang*,
Not to be grasped by sight.
Do not compare it to tones and rhythms,
For it is soundless.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
The cord’s endless pull—
Unnamable, for it is not a single hue,
Not to be divided by green, yellow, red, white, or black.
Not a single sound,
Not to be distinguished by the five tones.
Not a single form,
Not to be measured by length, breadth, or size.

Purge emotion and desire—
The True Nature’s wind gathers.
Cling to the ancient, align with the present—
The ultimate transformation clears.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
To uphold the ancient Dao/Way’s non-action,
And govern the present’s affairs—
Then one returns to simplicity and purity.

Expand the Dao/Way without division or obscurity,
Communicate universally above and below—
Thus clarity shines.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
Its upper reaches are not dazzling,
Its lower depths are not murky.
Again it says:
Those above must be clear,
Those below must be murky.
Yet the Dao/Way is neither above nor below,
Nor is it clear or murky in itself.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage’s Conduct**
The ancient Sage who excelled in virtue
Guarded the Dao’s mysterious path.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
Mysterious—
Like Heaven’s vastness.
His resolve and conduct were profound,
Beyond the Dao/Way’s reach.
Inner vision as blind,
Returned hearing as deaf—
Yet he knew its length.
Steady as winter’s river crossing,
His True Nature revealed.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
Steady as crossing a river in winter.
Again it says:
Steady—
Unruffled ease.
The Sage, in times of transition,
Acts like crossing winter’s river,
While common folk cling and fear.
Now I am unsoiled,
Thus my ease is steady.

Dissolving like ice in spring,
The world’s dust vanishes.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
Dissolving like ice about to melt.
Again it says:
Dissolving—
Scattering and fading,
Purging emotion, abandoning desire—
Each day grows clearer,
Like spring ice melting away.

Slowly purified, none recognize—
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
Water murky must first be stilled,
Then gradually clears itself.
Yet even in murkiness,
It can blend with the common.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
The muddy guards its original truth,
The murky does not reflect.
To blend with the common yet not exalt oneself.

Preserve one’s resolve without swelling like the pine’s stubborn grip,
Guard its flaws and in obscurity achieve success.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
To uphold this gradual, growing Dao/Way,
Without indulging in excess or rigid fullness.»

「Again it says: One must not cling to anything.
If one clings to purity and seeks life,
This is called excess and fullness,
And one will lose this Dao/Way.

Again it says: Only those who do not indulge in excess can preserve their flaws,
And not be destroyed by newfound success.
Those who embrace their flaws hide their glory,
Those who achieve new success value their accomplishments.

Chapter Sixteen: *The Chapter of Extreme Emptiness*
To attain purity of heart and simplicity of conduct, reaching the state of extreme emptiness,
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
Those who attain the Dao/Way
Diminish their emotions and abandon their desires,
Their five viscera remain serene,
And thus they reach extreme emptiness.
With steadfast resolve, they transcend the world’s dust.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
To uphold serene stillness,
And practice profound sincerity.
All things return to their roots, clearly revealing the Dao/Way’s instruction,
And one contentedly follows its natural course.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
All things wither without fail,
Each returns to its origin,
And thus they regenerate.
The heart, like an empty valley, holds vast capacity,
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
To know and guard the True Constant,
The heart’s realm becomes empty and serene,
Like that valley, containing all things without limit.

Virtue aligns with the central heavens, evenly covering all.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
Virtue harmonizes with the heavens,
Thus merging with the Dao/Way.

The Dao/Way ensures enduring longevity and blessings.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
To merge with the Dao/Way,
One attains long-lasting endurance.
To reveal the peril of eternal decay,
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
To follow the Dao/Way as the heavens do,
One’s body ultimately returns to them—
The fate of eternal decay and peril.

Chapter Seventeen: *The Chapter of the Supreme Sovereign*
Governance must emulate the age of primordial simplicity,
Illuminating like the sun, without partiality.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
The Supreme Sovereign refers to the ruler of the ancient, nameless age.
Those who know of his existence below,
Yet fail to see the natural purity of things,
Are beneath him.

When accomplishments are fulfilled and affairs settled, the world grows tranquil,
Yet none know of the drudging labor of digging wells or plowing fields.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
When deeds are done without clinging,
And affairs accomplished without action,
The common folk live their daily lives unaware—
This is the Supreme Sovereign’s natural way.

To distance oneself from artificiality and return to pristine simplicity,
Restoring the true Dao/Way,
And to observe the constant, fearing disrespect to preserve grand principles.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
Virtue declines, rulers grow corrupt,
And people cannot bear their lives—
Thus they are driven by punishments and feared.
Emotions are harbored, deceit is practiced,
Yet they cannot discern, so they are disrespected.
If a ruler’s trust and balance were sufficient,
Would his subjects dare to deceive him openly?

*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"Trust is insufficient when there is distrust."*
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says:
When a ruler’s trust is insufficient,
His subjects below harbor distrust.

Chapter Eighteen: *The Chapter of the Great Dao’s Decline*
Without revering the Great Dao/Way, distinctions of benevolence and righteousness arise.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"When the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, benevolence and righteousness appear."*

When filial piety is lost, distinctions of familial affection and compassion emerge.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"When the six bonds of kinship are fractured, filial piety and compassion arise."*

When the reins of governance cannot be forgotten, distinctions of action and inaction appear.

The ruler’s governance is like a rotting rope guiding six horses.
Only by knotting cords can the principle of *wuwei* be harmonized.
In the age of antiquity, governance was conducted through knotted cords.
When talent soars to eight bushels, hypocrisy and deceit arise.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"When wisdom emerges, great deceit appears."*

Loyalty meets its end with the Three Loyal Ministers as the nation’s fate declines.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"When a state is in chaos, loyal ministers arise."*
This refers to Duke Mu of Qin, who buried the Three Loyal Ministers alive.

Even when all stars withdraw their brilliance,
The sun’s radiance still shines universally across the horizon.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* commentary says: *"In the age of the Great Dao/Way,
benevolence and righteousness vanish, filial piety and compassion fade—
yet the sun remains resplendent, and the stars lose their light."*

**Chapter Nineteen: *The Chapter of Abandoning the Sage and Discarding Wisdom***
When both sageliness and wisdom are cast aside, vast *qi* flows pure and clear.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"Abandon the sage, discard wisdom."*

Where does one employ cleverness in cultivating the self?
The Master of *Xuan* [Zhuangzi] guards the Mysterious, transcending the world.
Zhuangzi wandered freely, abandoning sageliness and wisdom,
preserving the True Dao/Way, and wrote *The True Classic of the South* [Nanhua Zhenjing] for the world.

Those who turn from the Dao/Way and boast of culture only invite ridicule.
Qiao Heng, styled Zhengping, relied on his schemes and often acted arrogantly.

**Chapter Twenty: *The Chapter of Abandoning Learning and Having No Worries***
To drag the tortoise’s tail and float on the turtle’s shell—
nature’s way is to preserve life’s true essence.
The sacred tortoise, trailing its tail, preserves its nature whole;
the mountain wood, rooted in the earth, thrives without artifice.
Few desires and little self—return to purity’s simplicity.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"Few desires, little self."*

Only then does one ascend to the Vermilion Terrace—
the Celestial Capital.
The Vermilion Terrace—this is the heart.
If one accumulates virtue and practice,
the Celestial Capital and Penglai Mountain appear within the heart itself.

**Chapter Twenty: *The Chapter of Abandoning Learning and Having No Worries***
If one can abandon learning, then worries vanish.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"Abandon learning, have no worries."*

Good and evil sprout from the heart—yet freedom remains.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"How far apart are good and evil?"*
To explain the common path—abandon learning, have no worries.
If not abandoned, worries arise.
The scheming mind is ever restless—when will it find peace?
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"The vulgar mind is ever probing,
establishing laws and institutions."*
Joyous and desiring—when will this frenzy cease?
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"The multitude bustles and strives."*
Joyous—this means licentious pleasures, boundless desires.
The field of emotions stilled—everyday joy returns.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"Appearance suddenly dims as if in darkness,
yet the heart is serene, severed from worldly learning."*

The waters of wisdom swirl—beyond them lies sorrow.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"The vulgar mind is ever bright—
boasting of cleverness."*
Revealing the coarse, the hidden—enlightenment dawns.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"Yet I alone seem dull and crude."*
It also says: *"The dull have no distinctions,
the crude lack sufficiency—
yet the heart truly understands,
though outwardly it seems lacking."*

To turn back and ride the sea in search of Penglai—
Qin Shi Huang sought the Isles of the Immortals,
yet only wandered into empty delusion.
Could he ever enter the Dao?

**Chapter Twenty-One: *The Chapter of the Sage’s Graceful Bearing***
To contain filth and impurity—this is the True One.
Humility and harmony with all, inwardly cultivating the genuine.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"Those of great virtue contain all things,
able to bear filth and impurity,
dwelling in humility."*

Though opening green eyes to the times’ demands,
the hidden heart of jade remains untouched by the world’s dust.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"The virtuous do not follow the times’ fashions,
for they follow the Dao alone."*

Vague and indistinct—no fixed form or image.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"The Dao is vague and formless,
yet within it, it alone gives birth to all things."*

Deep and dark—ineffable, the spirit’s treasure.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"The Dao is deep and dark, formless,
yet within it lies essence—
the divine and luminous intermingle,
yin and yang unite."*

Know that the Supreme Dao rests eternally—
like the fragrant *Zhuang* and *Chun* trees in the jade caverns of spring.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"From ancient times to now, the Dao remains ever-present."*

**Chapter Twenty-Two: *The Chapter of Bending to Preserve Oneself***
To bend oneself and cultivate—this is to preserve.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"To bend to others, not asserting oneself—this is preservation."*

Wealth brings confusion, truly the mark of the virtuous.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"Those with much wealth are confused in guarding themselves."*

Deeply scheming, borrowing Zhang Liang’s sinew—
when success comes, shaking off Fan Li’s boat.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"He who does not boast of his deeds
has true merit."*

To abandon right and wrong—peace fills the streets.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"The Sage neither asserts himself nor denies others,
thus he shines brightly in the world."*

Not shunning the lowly or crooked—why compete for the first?
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"To bend oneself to extend others."*
It also says:
*"The earth is low and receives the waters;
the humble receive virtue."*

Like the poor and meager, yet cultivating hidden virtue—
the jade trees and palaces of the immortals appear before one’s eyes.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"If one long preserves poverty and humility,
not boasting of virtue,
then others will extol their worth.
Thus, the games of the jade trees and palaces
are found within the heart—
not sought externally."*

**Chapter Twenty-Three: *The Chapter of Rarity and Blindness***
If one understands the rarity of speech, virtue and the Dao align.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"Rarity of speech—this is forgetting speech.
It is not called ‘silent speech’ but ‘rare speech,’
for to explain the Dao with words,
one cannot entirely forget them.
When enlightenment comes, speech is forgotten—
thus, it is called ‘rare.’"*

If one can, through speech, awaken to the Dao,
not clinging to words—then one aligns with nature.

Deep sighs for those who lose the mysterious work.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"The lost are lost together."*
This means: to harm oneself and others.

Entangled in the world’s net like a monkey in chains—
enlightened, the crane escapes the cage.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"Clinging to words and teachings,
there is no path to enlightenment."
It also says:
*"Those who embody the Dao awaken to it,
forgetting speech—thus they align with the Dao."*

All night, no violent rain is heard;
all day, no fierce wind blows.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*"Violent winds do not last the morning,
torrent rains do not last the day."
This means: violence cannot endure.*

To dislike the strong yet uphold tranquility—
the heart, like a cloudless moon in the sky.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"In action, one should be like the Dao—tranquil,
yet not like violent winds or sudden rains."*

**Chapter Twenty-Four: *The Chapter of the Lame Not Standing***
Self-admiring, displaying one’s brilliance—
only knowing to flaunt one’s talents and connections.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"People admire their appearance and actions,
believing them good and in accord with the Dao—
yet they do not know their form is ugly,
their conduct vulgar.
To display their talents and boast of themselves
is to invite blame and remain obscure."*

If one can obscure one’s traces and reveal true nature—
to shun fame and avoid misfortune’s womb.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"To covet power and seek fame,
to rush toward功 and honor—
this cannot endure in life or the Dao."*

Must one fear right and wrong, becoming a nest of grudges?
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"To assert oneself and deny others—
this is the nest of grudges."*

Can one guard against arrogance and preserve the pure heart?
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says: *"The arrogant do not endure."*
The pure heart—this is the mind.

Do not let those who harm others still fear them—
far from the nest, the bird’s flight is not distant.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"If those who assert themselves and boast
hold power, all things fear and hate them—
thus, the Sage does not dwell in such lands."*

「有物混成」—*The Dao/Way of the Cosmic Whole* (Chapter Twenty-Five)
The *Pengyáng* islands are hard to leave—
their waves run deep as the boundless sea.
*Xu Fu*’s folly was wild and vain—
his reckless quest for immortality.

The Four Great Elements must be known—
the Dao/Way is vast, the heavens vast,
the earth vast, and kingship vast as well.
Yet the Dao/Way’s power is rooted in the earth,
and the earth’s nature is boundless as the heavens.
The Three Realms are not distant—
they lie within the human heart.

*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"Mystic efficacy knows no limits,
and grand titles cannot be seized by force—
thus, those who claim greatness
and pursue it will find it flees them,
while those who chase it will never catch it.
If one can truly comprehend this,
then the Dao/Way returns to the self—
to be realized in body and mind."*

The First Emperor sought vigor in vain,
and the Han Emperor labored in vain—
his quest for alchemy and elixirs.
To grasp the Dao/Way’s tranquil truth,
one must cast aside worldly pursuits
and ascend into misty heights.

*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"Humans must align with the earth’s Dao/Way—
to dwell in tranquility, harmony, and softness.
To exhaust the logic of tranquility,
one must not be a recluse fleeing society."*

---

「蚕为轻根」—*Silkworms and the Lightness of Desire* (Chapter Twenty-Six)
The Dao/Way is like a cart’s burden—
never stray from the body.
To hold fast to stillness,
one must first know its worth as sovereign.

*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"A cart is a vehicle,
and its burden is the goods it carries.
Those who value stillness must guard it well,
as one who protects a cart’s precious load.
Thus, losing the cart’s burden brings hunger and cold,
while those who love lightness and agitation invite disaster and chaos.
The Dao/Way says: Stillness is the sovereign of agitation."*

The multitude, burdened by desires,
suffer as if weaving endless threads.
The lofty sage, unbound by self-interest,
moves like clouds in the sky.

The Han Emperor’s frugality nurtured his lineage,
while the Yin King’s excess corrupted his legacy.

*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"Palaces and chambers,
where consorts dwell—
must be shunned with detachment,
lest one be tainted by them.
The Han Emperor was frugal and modest,
ensuring his consorts’ robes never trailed the ground.
The Yin King was ensnared by the beauty of Daji,
and indulged in wanton debauchery."*

To reach a heartless unity with all things,
one must not disturb the white herons on the river.
A heartless regard for all things,
and all things will return to it.

Ancient tales speak of one who entered an island—
without intent, the herons did not flee.
But when he harbored designs to capture them,
the herons took flight and never settled.

---

「善间行」—*The Art of Skillful Conduct* (Chapter Twenty-Seven)
If one comprehends the Dao/Way’s subtleties,
they need not leave their hall.
For the heart is the realm of white clouds.

*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"The adept in the Dao/Way
need not descend from their chamber,
nor venture beyond the door—
they realize true nature within all phenomena."*

The world is deceived by gold and elixirs,
while men scramble up mountains and ford rivers.
Yet stillness within the hall
can reveal the Dao/Way’s mysteries.

Alas, those who fail to grasp its logic,
boil five stones in vain,
travel the four seas in vain—
what accord can they find with the Dao/Way?

If the Five Virtues of Skill are concealed and applied,
the Three Realms will witness the *Xūhuáng*’s emptiness.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*"The adept in conduct leaves no trace,
the adept in speech leaves no flaw or censure,
the adept in calculation need not compute,
the adept in closure need not lock,
the adept in binding need not tie.
These are the Five Virtues of Skill."*

In vain did the Han Emperor labor for his throne—
the wind stirs in *Màolíng*, shaking the evening sun.
Though the Han Emperor longed for immortality,
he lacked the resolve to transcend the world.
He wasted treasures in futile pursuit,
and though he dreamed of *Pengyáng*,
he never reached it.

Did he not know that enlightenment lies within?
No need for external seeking—
yet he was deceived by *Lǐ Shàoshōng* and *Lè Dà*,
and ended in vain illusion.
*Màolíng* is the Emperor’s burial mound.

---

「知其雄」—*Knowing the Masculine and Feminine* (Chapter Twenty-Eight)
Though knowing the masculine is easy,
to guard the feminine is hard.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*"Know its masculine, guard its feminine."*

Like the innocence of an infant,
one’s vast *qi* finds peace.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*"Return to the state of an infant."*

If one understands the bright and clear,
yet labors with endless schemes—
better to embrace the dark and tranquil,
where the Three *Dān* dwell.

*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"When one knows the bright and clear,
they must return to guard it with darkness and obscurity,
so nothing is seen.
When one knows their own grandeur,
they must guard it with humility and filth,
so nothing is heard."*

To govern the realm or govern oneself,
one must establish grand measures.
Yet accumulated merit will bind one like *jiāolián*—
a net of golden threads.

*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"The Sage employs the Dao/Way
to govern the world—
unharmed, uncut.
To govern oneself,
they employ the Dao/Way to restrain emotions,
and do not damage their spirit."*

When one seeks to take the world,
the sacred vessel must first be returned—
to abandon artificiality.

*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"To employ artificial means in governing the people—
the Sage first establishes the foundation of Great Peace.
At the beginning, they hold no grasp,
yet at the end, they never lose it."*

If one hates relying on strength,
yet still does not prevail—

*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"Where there is strength, there is weakness."*

The Han Emperor’s palaces shunned embroidered splendor,
and the *Yáo* Emperor’s steps were lined with humble thatch.

Ascending to great treasures,
what need is there for such caution?

「When words are spoken as the imperial decree,
all under heaven follows in harmony.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"What the ruler above does, the people below will surely follow."*

**Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao/Way (Chapter Thirty-Two)**
Eight virtuous ministers aid the reign,
yet do not exhaust military might—
they dread the onset of perilous crises.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*"To assist the sovereign with the Dao/Way is to not rely on arms to overpower all under heaven."*

Fields and tillage first abandoned,
yet still should be considered with care.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*"Where the army encamps, thorns and brambles spring up."*
Farming neglected,
the land left unworked.

Victory or defeat uncertain—
one must proceed with utmost caution.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"The tally of victory and defeat cannot yet be measured."*

Cease aggression without arrogance—
three commands stand in solemn order.
The people pacified,
the multitudes in harmony—
all four quarters return.
*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s commentary says:
*"Those skilled in assisting the sovereign are resolute in halting the enemy.
Yet their true purpose lies in pacifying the people and uniting the multitudes—
they would never dare seek victory or force to aggrandize themselves.
Though resolute in halting the enemy,
they are not brigands,
so be warned: do not boast of triumph or seize strength,
for arrogance leads to ruin.
Thus, this is a profound admonition.
To plot deeply and halt the enemy benefits the sovereign—
why boast of feats or display martial splendor?"*

**On the Fine Arts of War (Chapter Thirty)**
Wielding arms in conflict is like
resting in stillness—
strategy triumphs without battle.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* says:
*"The fine arts of war are the most ominous of instruments."*

Emperor *Yáo* of the *Táng* Dynasty held virtue supreme,
his grasp of the sacred was unyielding.
Righteousness lofty, the recluse’s pure winds
drift far beyond.

「Return.

*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"Those who excel in aiding and uniting others
are resolute in halting the enemy.
Indeed, in pacifying the people and uniting the multitudes—
they would never dare seek victory or force to aggrandize themselves.
Though resolute in halting the enemy,
they are not brigands,
so be warned: do not boast of triumph or seize strength,
for arrogance leads to ruin.
Thus, this is a profound admonition.
To plot deeply and halt the enemy benefits the sovereign—
why boast of feats or display martial splendor?"*

**On the Fine Arts of War (Chapter Thirty)**
The use of arms in conflict is like
resting in stillness and triumphing through strategy.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* states:
*"The fine arts of war are the most ominous of instruments."*

Emperor *Yáo* of *Táng* held virtue supreme,
his grasp of the sacred was unyielding.
With righteousness lofty, the pure winds of the recluse
drifting far beyond,
he frugally spread the auspicious *qi* of humble thatched dwellings.
Yáo abdicated the empire to *Xǔ Yóu*.
When the age was at peace, the swords and spears were melted away,
and the imperial *Dao/Way* flourished.
At the *Wàng Yí* Hall, the Qin dynasty’s calamity was sealed—
no sacrifice remained.
In vain, the Great Wall was built to encircle the sea’s edge.

Emperor *Yáo* of *Táng* illuminated civilization,
expanding the winds of pure stillness.
He did not wield the fine arts of war to pacify the four quarters,
but instead ruled with unadorned robes,
bringing blessings to the people.
His grand deeds flourished evermore.
If harmony were not found in humble thatched dwellings,
and martial implements not melted into swords and spears,
then this would be a model for ten thousand ages—
would it not be perfect?

Qin’s First Emperor *Shǐhuáng* abandoned the *Dao/Way* and relied on cunning,
unifying the world.
His ambitions never sated, the seeds of calamity took root,
his wisdom neglected, so the Great Wall was built.
Yet he failed to know
that his successor would be *Húhài*,
government entrusted to *Zhào Gāo*,
and *Liú Xiàng* would rise from *Shāndōng*,
while *Chéng Qín* fell in *Héběi*.
*Zhào Gāo*, fearing punishment,
murdered *Húhài* at the *Wàng Yí* Hall.
Alas!

**On the Nameless Dao/Way (Chapter Thirty-Two)**
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"Though simple, the Dao/Way is vast—
who would dare to serve it?"*

The *Dàodéjīng* states:
*"The Dao/Way, though simple, is vast—
none under heaven would dare to serve it."*

Lords and kings govern with unity,
nurturing the people’s needs.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"If lords and kings could guard the unity of the Dao/Way,
practicing non-action while transforming,
then all things would willingly submit and obey."*

When virtue shines, the *Dao/Way* flows like rivers to the sea,
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"The *Dao/Way* in the world corresponds with people,
as streams and valleys flow into rivers and seas."*

When governance follows non-action, all things submit in harmony.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* states:
*"If lords and kings could guard this,
all things would willingly submit."*

The gentle breeze and fragrant winds
spread warmth and harmony.
The sweet dew and nourishing rain
manifest equilibrium.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"If lords and kings could embrace and guard the unity of the Dao/Way,
then heaven would become complete and earth level,
interchange would bring harmony,
and thus the sweet dew would descend,
moistening orchids and lush grasses—
without laboring over commands, all things would naturally align."*

Take this as an analogy:
Lords and kings, like the gentle breeze,
apply measures evenly.
How could one recognize the *Dao/Way* of *Xīxuān*?
The sun and moon stand steadfast in virtue,
bringing spring to all lands.

**On Knowing Others (Chapter Thirty-Three)**
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"To know others is wisdom."*

To discern good and evil is true wisdom.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"To know people’s likes and dislikes is wisdom."*

To distinguish the worthy from the foolish is true clarity.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"When people can know themselves—
whether virtuous or unworthy—
this is called returning to listen without sound,
and inward vision without form—true clarity."*

To conquer oneself and surpass others relies on favorable conditions,
to remove emotions and desires reveals a pure heart.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"Those who conquer others
do so only through coercive power."*

Further annotated:
*"When people conquer themselves,
removing emotions and desires,
then none under heaven can contend with them—
this is true strength."*

*Yuán Ān* knew contentment,
finding poverty superior to wealth,
while *Liàn Guǎng* forgot worldly cares,
retiring to find decline more honorable than prosperity.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"The contented are rich."*

Further annotated:
*"When people exert strength to do good,
they align with the *Dao/Way*,
and the *Dao/Way* also aligns with them."*

Success achieved through subtlety
goes unrecognized by the world,
while the *Dao/Way*’s blessings endure,
nourishing all living beings.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"When people can restrain themselves,
nourishing without excess,
receiving the accumulated *qi* of heaven,
they can endure long."*

**The Vast Dao/Way (Chapter Thirty-Four)**
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"The Dao/Way pervades all things,
bringing them to life."*

Do not compare the *Dao/Way* to worldly rules and measures,
*The Dao/Way Dejing* states:
*"All things return to it,
yet it does not claim mastery."*

It reaches to the utmost flourishing—
not relying on personal merit.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"All things depend on the Dao/Way’s spontaneous activity to flourish,
yet the Dao/Way does not boast of its labor.
When its functions are complete,
it does not name itself as the owner."*

Hiding virtue, concealing name,
forgetting grandiosity—
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"The sage follows the Dao/Way,
hiding virtue and concealing name,
not seeking to be grand."*

Examining oneself according to the Dao/Way,
attaining reverence without self-aggrandizement.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"Thus, the sage follows the Dao/Way,
forgetting personal merit,
yet ultimately achieves grand deeds."*

The *Yú* dynasty refined governance,
and after tuning the *qín* zither,
grasses and trees flourished,
as gentle winds brought sweetness.

**On Grasping the Great Symbol (Chapter Thirty-Five)**
People return to the ultimate *Dao/Way*,
comparable to paying homage to the ancestral temple.
When virtue resonates, governance unfolds through grand deeds.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* states:
*"Grasping the great symbol,
all under heaven will come."*

The symbol’s outward form is not like painted colors,
*The Dao/Way Dejing* states:
*"It is unseen."*

Further annotated:
*"The formless is not like the five hues—
green, yellow, red, white, and black—
which can be seen."*

The world’s opening lies in the *zither* and *paulownia*.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* states:
*"It is inaudible."*

Further annotated:
*"The Dao/Way is not like the five tones—
*gōng*, *shāng*, *jué*, *zhèng*, and *yǔ*—
which can be heard."*

It permeates even in dreams,
reaching the Three *Isles*,
yet does not descend favors or honors
upon the Six Palaces.
A land grows rich, its people prosper,
creating a treasure of blessings.
Using the Dao/Way, its influence never fades.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"When the Dao/Way governs the state,
the land grows rich and its people prosper.
When it governs the self,
longevity and vitality endure—
thus, its use has no end."*

Further annotated:
*"With the Dao/Way as one’s foundation,
initially there are no words or teachings,
so it is unseen and inaudible.
Yet the gentle winds prevail,
and all things flourish.
The year’s abundance is limitless—
its use cannot be exhausted."*

**When One Would Collect (Chapter Thirty-Six)**
First, indulge the heart of greed,
then still the restless desires.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* annotates:
*"Thus, to collect and restrain the emotions of all beings,
one must first expand their hearts of desire,
letting them be constrained by their own cravings—
then they will naturally cease."*

Yet know:
The gentle overcome the strong,
but the upright may suffer from the treacherous.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* states:
*"The gentle overcome the strong."*

*Liú Xiàng*’s name endured,
for he could abstain from grain.
*Liú Xiàng* of *Hàn* abstained from grain,
and followed *Chìsōngzǐ*.
When his deeds were complete,
he retired as *Viceroy Fàn* and cast his image in gold.
*Viceroy Fàn*’s deeds accomplished,
he vanished, leaving only his golden likeness—
morning after morning, he attended court.

The later King of Yue reflected upon him,
and with gold he wielded power to govern all things—
his great deeds flourished, his fame spread through the ages.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* notes:
*"Compliance and yielding can wield power,
thus enabling governance."*

Wielding power is the Dao’s eternal chapter of non-action,
*The Dao/Way Dejing* states:
*"The Dao acts without doing,
yet nothing remains undone."*

The Viceroy’s teachings shifted the hearts of the people.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* notes:
*"When all things are transformed,
they return to their original state—
those who seek clever deceit
must be steadied by the Viceroy’s virtue and power."*

The land of Han first cultivated simplicity and purity,
then all beneath it mirrored the age of tranquility.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* notes:
*"If the Viceroy can uphold the Dao and act without doing,
then all things will transform naturally—
his own non-action is pure and simple."*

Rain and dew rewarded his virtuous deeds,
while humble thatched roofs displayed his frugality—
moss and spirit-keel bloomed in splendor.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* notes:
*"If the Viceroy embodies the transformation of non-action,
the heavens will surely bestow the auspicious signs
of the Yellow River’s clarity and spirit-keel’s growth."*

The world then aligned, restoring the Viceroy’s august reign.
*The Dao/Way Dejing* notes:
*"If he acts without doing,
the realm will naturally correct itself.
*Correct/align* means to settle and define."*

His towering legacy brought prosperity for ten thousand generations.

*The Dao/Way Dejing*’s mystical verses conclude in Volume One.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing*’s mystical verses begin in Volume Two.

「Newly appointed as the Viceroy of Yingzhou, Defense Judge, and Trial Officer of the Great Justice Bureau,兼监察御史宋鸾 presents *The Virtue/Power Dejing*, Chapter Thirty-Eight: *The Virtue/Power of Non-Attachment*

One must know that the Virtue/Power of the Highest Dao seeks no reward,
and seeking reward only betrays its boundless measure.

*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"Those of the Highest Virtue/Power give without seeking return,
while those of lesser Virtue/Power must always expect reward in kind."

To embody the Dao, one must hold steadfast to its depth,
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"Rulers who align with the Dao possess extraordinary techniques to save all beings.
When their deeds are complete and their influence profound,
they dwell in the Dao’s pure simplicity,
not in the superficiality of rites and propriety."

Their grand ambition lies in non-action—
unadorned, they reject all pomp.

*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"Action is the Dao’s superficiality.
Rites and propriety are Virtue/Power’s adornment.
Thus, the Sage abides in the affairs of non-action,
dwelling in its depth,
and never in its shallowness.
To abandon the practices of rites and propriety,
to discard their adornment,
is to return to their true essence."

The Three Sovereigns were pure and simple—truly worthy of emulation,
while the Six Kingdoms, though lavish, fall short of praise.

*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"Speaking of rites in the age of simplicity is either madness or reckless abandon.
To forget rites in a time of excess is either foolishness or deceit.
If one can dissolve and renew them,
they must abandon rites to practice justice,
abandon justice to practice benevolence,
abandon benevolence to practice Virtue/Power,
and forget Virtue/Power to merge with the Dao.
When people return to simplicity,
they embody the Highest Virtue/Power’s non-action."

The hidden deeds of governance yield the greatest merit—
far surpassing the alchemy of gold and elixirs.

The Sovereign of the Xī Dynasty inscribed the trigrams to cultivate culture,
while the Sovereign of the Xuān Dynasty hung the mirror to pacify chaos.
Emperor Yáo wore unadorned robes,
Emperor Shùn danced with feathers,
Great Yǔ tamed the floods,
Emperor Tāng abolished the nets—
each achieved great deeds in their age,
bringing governance that secured life and longevity for the people.
Could the alchemist alone compare to their Virtue/Power and Dao?

Chapter Thirty-Nine: *The Virtue/Power of Unity*

When rulers attain the One, they govern the world with ease.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* says:
"When rulers attain non-action,
the world naturally aligns."

All things follow the Dao’s subtle essence and come to life.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"All things follow the Dao’s subtle essence,
thus they are born and never perish."

Their teachings are clear without ostentation,
their names are humble without self-aggrandizement.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"舆 (yú) is another name for a carriage.
When all parts are complete, it is called a carriage (舆).
When separated, they are called wheels, axles, and spokes—
each with its own name—
thus, there is no single *舆*.
Similarly, kings and rulers call themselves *孤寡不谷* (gū guà bù yú),
abandoning grand titles,
and returning to the essence of humility.
This is the profound Virtue/Power of yielding and modesty."

The high heavens are empty and tranquil—
the stars shine brightly in order.

*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"The heavens follow the Dao’s purity and emptiness,
thus they are exalted and never sullied by worldly things."

The thick earth is settled and peaceful—
the Nine Regions lie undisturbed.

*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"The earth follows the Dao’s yielding and compliance,
thus it is stable and peaceful,
enduring all things without ever tipping or moving."

The Sovereign’s deeds are vast and far-reaching,
while the mountain-dwelling recluse acts alone in seclusion.

The Sovereign of the Xuān Dynasty pacified the troubles of Chī Yóu,
saving all beings,
and the people received eternal blessings,
spreading everlasting beauty.

Though the Prince of the State of Wáng (子晋) may have charmed the phoenix with his flute,
crossed the world on the dragon,
and saved himself alone—
untainted by dust—
his kindness extended to all,
yet he lacked the true techniques of salvation.

---

Chapter Forty: *The Dao’s Movement of Return*

The ruler seeks the Mystic Gate without wearying—
the spirit’s traces emerge, manifesting as the Pine and the Qiao.

The Pine Child (赤松子) and Wáng Qiao (王乔),
both ancient masters who attained the Dao and transcended the world.

The tranquil earth’s axis generates all things broadly,
while the heavens’ movements harmonize the sequence of qi.

*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"As the heavens are strong and vigorous,
they move the sun and moon in day and night,
and the four seasons cycle endlessly without rest.
Thus, those who cultivate the Dao,
if they can clear their hearts,
move the qi within their bodies day and night without pause—
they align with the heavens’ enduring nature.

It further notes:
"The things of heaven and earth are all things.
The Dao is *有* (yǒu, existence).
The Dao generates all things,
thus we know that the things of heaven and earth are born from *有*,
and *有* arises from *无* (wú, non-existence).
If all things attain the Dao’s essence—
the harmonious interplay of the strong and yielding—
they will achieve longevity and swift transformation.
Hence, it is said:
*The things of heaven and earth are born from existence,
existence from non-existence.*"

The worthy minister plans strategies for governance—
to aid and assist in the realm’s affairs.

*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"Those who wield authority must return to reality,
and those who act must rely on non-action.
If one can forget both authority and reality,
and erase both existence and non-existence,
they embody the principle of aiding and assisting in governance."

The Perfect Ones cultivate and attain true freedom.

Those who cultivate their bodies discard cleverness and brilliance,
conceal their light, and refine their practice—
in quietude, they find freedom and ease.
Yet they do not know the Dao of aiding and assisting in governance.

To govern oneself and the realm in hidden merit is sufficient—
one will naturally ascend to the Vermilion Gate’s court.

If one governs their body fully and achieves success in the realm,
they will follow the Pine Child and Wáng Qiao,
ascending together to the Vermilion Gate.

Chapter Forty-One: *The Virtue/Power of the Superior*

The Superior, Middle, and Inferior all hear the Dao,
yet their acceptance and practice differ in origin.

The Superior, upon hearing the Dao, acts with resolve—
the Inferior, lost in confusion, laughs in derision.

*The Virtue/Power Dejing* says:
"The Superior, upon hearing the Dao, acts with resolve.
The Middle, upon hearing the Dao, clings to it uncertainly.
The Inferior, upon hearing the Dao, laughs in derision.
To not laugh is insufficient for the Dao."

Advancing is like stepping into a deep abyss—
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* says:
"Advancing in the Dao is like retreating."

Clarity is like floating clouds reflecting distant space.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"Clarity in the Dao conceals its traces,
nurturing its purity,
which is the Sage’s true achievement."

Cultivating Virtue/Power is like stealing merit—
one’s name is inscribed in the Jade Emperor’s palace.

*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"Virtue/Power is cultivated inwardly,
yet outwardly appears as if stolen,
desiring no recognition,
and achieving merit without ostentation."

---

Chapter Forty-Two: *The Dao Generates the One*

Teach others softness and frailty as precious,
to preserve their bodies whole and intact.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"When rulers seek to teach others,
they should instruct them in the Way of softness,
frailty, humility, and modesty."

Believe that force and rigidity lose their nature.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* states:
"Those who rely on force and rigidity
do not meet their natural end."

Humble the will and hold to modesty—
virtue stands as a towering mountain.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"Kings and nobles who embrace solitude and humility,
lowering themselves to preserve their virtue,
do not they thereby diminish themselves
while gaining greater benefit?"

Excessive desires harm the mind—
they sow confusion in the fields of emotion.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"The foolish value arrogance and deception to seek advancement,
while greedily hoarding wealth they gain—
do not they thereby gain what harms them?"

The moon hangs in autumn’s clarity,
illuminating a thousand leagues.
The rivers surge with roaring waves,
stirring the hundred streams.

The *Viceroy Fan* drifts beyond fame,
his light dust scorns worldly affairs,
riding the winds upon the Five Lakes’ boat.
Fan Li, renouncing glory, fled to Yue,
following his nature on the Five Lakes,
may be said to embody the Dao
and awaken to its truth first.

**Chapter Forty-Three: *The Dao of the Utterly Soft***
The utterly soft overcomes the utterly firm—

—

「The *Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
The utterly soft of the world—
that is the true nature of things.
If one roams through worldly affairs,
entangled in the dusty realm,
with passions and desires overflowing,
then it becomes the utterly firm of the world.
At this moment, when the utterly soft overcomes the utterly firm,
it reveals how the utterly firm cannot rival the utterly soft’s true nature.

The dusty realm is hard to confuse—
only those who hold fast to the uncarved can remain undisturbed.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
Those who possess nothing are untouched by the dusty realm.
Let the mind be empty of all things,
guard the solitary purity of the uncarved and the tranquil stillness,
perfectly embodying the undivided whole—
unshaken by desires,
never disrupted by the alluring.

Believe not in silence as mere closure of the mouth,
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
Silence is not about sealing the mouth—
in principle, it is both presence and absence;
in teaching, it is both speech and tacit understanding.
Even as speech fills the world,
there is no fault in the doctrine of silence.

Only now does it become clear:
The benefit of *having* comes from *non-being*.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
I know the benefit of *non-being*.
Before the frost, the crane’s call harmonizes with the celestial melody,
at the snow’s edge, the upright pine stands beyond the vulgar.

*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
When my body and mind are tranquil and still,
I can align with the Dao.
Body still, mind clear, desires forgotten—
the Jade Capital imagined is the first stage.
If one follows the Dao,
they must see the paths diverging from the Jade Capital.

**Chapter Forty-Four: *The Dao of What Is Truly Near***
Which is closer: name or self?
The more one treasures, the more one must perish thickly.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* states:
"Excessive hoarding brings thick destruction."
If one knows when to stop, they are wise and virtuous.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"Knowing when to stop brings no peril."
Chasing fame invites disaster—
the body lost as if bereaved.
A damp house, abundant wealth—
yet such matters can wound.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
Those who pursue wealth seek it,
but when wealth is gained, the body perishes—
which is more: the body or the wealth?
Thus, they cast away jade and shatter pearls
to preserve their harmony.

Alas, if one feeds on wealth while the body perishes,
even if one piles jade at home,
what value is there in it?

The wind passes through the Unending Palace,
swaying the lush grass.
The Unending Palace—
built by Xiao He, a thousand gates, ten thousand halls—
was once the world’s grandest splendor.
Now it has withered into mere grass,
its foundations still standing, empty.
Seeing this rise and fall,
it is enough to warn against greed.

The waters flow through the Golden Valley,
carrying the slanting sunlight.
The Golden Valley—
once a place of noble grandeur,
recorded in the *Simple Records*—
now has wild waters coursing through it,
suddenly become a ruined fortress,
bathed in the slanting light—
how could one not grieve?

The *Dao of Perfect Truth* requires the mind to be desireless—
it would laugh at the Lord of Sui for his prized *Night Light*.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"Name is the guest of substance,
yet those who serve others for the sake of name lose their own."
Let them abandon merit to preserve their truth.

**Chapter Forty-Five: *The Dao of Great Perfection***
Those who do not concern themselves with agitation or stillness—
Prthagṛṇha equalizes all things and frees the mind from dust.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* states:
"Agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat."
Further notes:
Only those who are utterly tranquil and do nothing
can have a peaceful mind and steady resolve,
and thus truly overcome agitation without cold,
and stillness without heat.
Erasing both agitation and stillness,
they become the world’s norm.

Straight thinking finds no successor in Ji Dan,
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"The most straight can seem bent."
Ji Dan—
a true and upright minister of the Han,
who spoke boldly and corrected the ruler,
never avoiding taboo—
who can follow him?

Sophisticated reasoning invites harm—
as seen in Su Qin’s fate.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* states:
"The most eloquent can seem inarticulate."
Su Qin—
the wandering orator of the Six States.
Though his cleverness flourished,
he valued superficiality.
Later, in Qi, he was assassinated,
his head cut off—
yet he loved the seals of the Six States,
and feared not the calamity of a single morning.
Proud of his eloquence and relying on his wit,
should he not be feared?

White jade stains the body—
even as it is pure.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"When learning and practice reach great perfection,
they are always as if stained by imperfection."
The Clear River holds the same depth with all beings.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"Empty and pure in the heart—
this is the way of holding fullness.
Full yet not overflowing,
they long endure in wealth and honor,
their use never exhausted."

The virtuous winds of Tang and Yu retreat in humility,
their noble deeds recorded in the *Trustworthy Histories*—
to be sought again.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* notes:
"When a ruler’s governance is perfectly accomplished,
yet they further practice humility and retreat,
it seems as if there is a flaw.
But if they renew their virtue daily,
their use will never be worn out."

**Chapter Forty-Six: *The Dao of the World’s Harmony***
Liang Ji, though lacking talent, relied on the imperial harem’s favor,
yet he could not know contentment or praise the rules of virtue.
*The Virtue/Power Dejing* states:
"Misfortune is not greater than failing to know contentment."
Now Liang Ji is the example—
though lacking talent, he relied on his favor,
which is indeed failing to know contentment.

At the height of the Han’s decline,
when the imperial house was most perilous,
he alone flourished in his crimson gates,
striding arrogantly.
In the later Han, under Emperor Huan of the Eastern Han,
the dynasty’s fate was precarious,
and people had grown cold and shallow.
Liang Ji, seated in the highest position of favor,
could neither correct the ruler with loyalty
nor restrain himself with frugality.
Instead, he made his household even more proud and arrogant,
becoming a tyrant who brought ruin upon himself.
His fortune exceeded—disaster arose—
he met the fate of self-annihilation.
Alas.

Sun Shou was utterly bewildered by embroidered finery,
Sun Shou—
Liang Ji’s wife.
She lost herself in the pursuit of beauty,
drowning in allure.
Zhang Gang merely shamed himself by asking about foxes and rabbits.

When the Han dispatched eight envoys to survey the customs of the realm,
Zhang Gang buried his wheels and refused to go,
saying: *"The jackals and wolves hold sway—
how can I ask about foxes and rabbits?"*
Thus he memorialized Liang Ji’s crimes.
Disaster overflowed—his kin were exterminated in three generations,
his deeds sullied the *Qingbian* annals for ages of lament.
Emperor Huan, deceived by Liang Ji’s extravagant pretenses,
ordered Dan Chao and others to encircle his estate and slay him.

**Chapter Forty-Seven: *Not Laboring to Peep Through the Window* (不出户)**
The Way reveals itself without need to spy through walls—
*Daojing* says: *"Without peeping through windows,
one perceives the Way’s unfolding."*

Within, the self is mirrored; beyond, the heart discerns.
*Daojing*’s commentary explains:
*"The Sage, though never leaving his home,
knows the world’s state—
by his own person he understands others,
by his own household he grasps theirs."*

The wars of Qin and Han boasted cunning stratagems,
while Tang and Yu ruled with serene and bright virtue.
*Daojing*’s commentary states:
*"When rulers cultivate stillness,
the *tianqi* aligns itself.
Excessive desires breed turmoil and corruption."*

**Chapter Forty-Eight: *Daily Learning* (为学日益)**
Shouldering the steep path to seek a master’s refined art,
his eloquence sharpens like a blade in the *Qingping* ford.
Lofty in character, he marks the land’s natural splendor,
his talent transcending ink and brush’s fleeting grace.
Do not scorn the scholar who prizes white snow’s love,
for he knows well the labor of gathering flying moths’ light.

If one could daily diminish the heart’s unfeeling cravings,
then might he grasp the toil of *youwei* shaping form.
*Daojing* says: *"For learning, one gains daily.
For the Way, one loses daily."*
Its further commentary declares:
*"The scholar’s path is daily growth in knowledge,
the Daoist’s is daily reduction of deeds.
Gaining knowledge is the slow ascent of study,
losing deeds is the gateway to enlightenment.
Thus, through accumulated effort, one forgets effort itself,
and attains the Way—
can this not be rest?"*

**Chapter Forty-Nine: *The Sage Has No Fixed Heart* (圣人无常心)**
The Sage acts with trembling yet holds no fixed resolve—
*Daojing* says: *"The Sage has no fixed heart,
for he takes the hearts of the people as his own."*
Responding to things, he extends virtue with boundless warmth.
*Daojing*’s commentary explains:
*"The Sage’s heart is stirred by all things,
and thus he responds.
Response arises from sensitivity,
so he has no fixed heart."*

Tending to infants with tender care, his virtue is shared like an emperor’s,
*Daojing*’s commentary states:
*"The Sage pities the common folk as a mother pities her child,
so all are seen as infants in his care."*

Guiding the virtuous and teaching the faithless to show his sovereign presence,
*Daojing*’s commentary says:
*"To those who revere virtue and trust in faith,
I follow their path.
To those who do not revere virtue and trust in faith,
I teach them virtue and faith,
so the people may feel my power and become virtuous and trusting."*

He rejoices in medicine’s return to the Way’s roots,
yet fears the *shenggan*’s allure—
*Daojing*’s commentary declares:
*"The Sage is vast, encompassing all,
like the Way mirroring Heaven—
his actions embody virtue and faith,
and all are drawn by his power,
unaware of his effortless transformation.
If rulers accept counsel and abandon delusion,
they naturally become virtuous and trusted.
All nations then joyfully follow,
returning to the Way’s bright reflection,
still as the moon, clear as the *chenqin*’s virtue."*

**Chapter Fifty: *Life and Death* (出生入死)**
Awakening and delusion share a single path—
*Daojing*’s commentary says: *"Enlightenment brings life,
obstinacy leads to death."*
Yet if one speaks of purity and impurity’s distinction,
accumulated merit and virtue can ascend to the Azure Han.

「感德港化，暗合无为之功。
*Rulers embody virtue and trust, harmonizing effortlessly,*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"All people turn their ears and eyes—*
*Yet again it says: The Way’s virtue covers all,*
*transforming the Sage’s power into goodness,*
*so they lean to observe the Sage."*

**Chapter Fifty: *Life and Death* (出生入死)**
Awakening and delusion share a single root—
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"Enlightenment brings life,
obstinacy leads to death."*

**Chapter Fifty: *The Dao’s Generation* (道生之)**
All beings arise from the Dao’s beginning—
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"The Dao’s birth is singular—*
*One gives rise to yin and yang,*
*Yin and yang generate all beings,*
*Thus knowing that myriad forms*
*cannot arise without the Dao."*

The Sage expands virtue, his law pure and round—
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"Heaven’s relation to all things,
*Generates yet does not possess,*
*Acts yet does not rely,*
*Nurtures yet does not dominate—*
*Letting them unfold naturally,*
*This is called Heaven’s virtue."*

*Similarly, the ruler governs the world.*
Without action, the realm is naturally tranquil—
*Daojing* says: *"The Way of virtue is without effort,
*Why should it favor the exalted?*
*All things naturally attain*
*their noble station,*
*Thus manifesting their natural rank and fate."*

*Not dominating, yet fostering growth,*
*Like the sun and moon’s radiant function.*
*Daojing* says: *"Nurturing yet not dominating."*
*Rain and dew shower deep benevolence,*
*Reviving grasses and woods,*
*Silken threads and gentle words*
*Bring fortune to the lowly.*

*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"The Dao’s relation to all things*
*Is not merely to give life and sustenance—*
*It further nurtures and matures them,*
*Shelters and protects them,*
*Preserving their essence and vitality.*
*The ruler, if he follows this,*
*In governing the nation and himself,*
*Should align with the Dao’s*
*Exalted virtue and noble station,*
*Returning to his natural rank and fate."*

*Green virtue covers all,*
*The Sage’s wind extends far,*
*All under heaven turn in harmony,*
*Peace naturally prevails.*

*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"The Dao’s virtue is not*
*Conferred by rank and fate—*
*Its generative and nurturing function*
*Covers all things,*
*Ever naturally noble in itself."*

**Chapter Fifty-Two: *The Origin of All Under Heaven* (天下有始)**
*Secrets of practice curb the six senses,*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"If the six senses are not indulged,*
*Then no calamity befalls.*
*Thus, throughout life, danger is avoided."*

*If one fears the mouth’s*
*Lust for bear’s paws’ delicacy,*
*And trembles at the heart’s*
*Delusion from the phoenix’s new coiffure,*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"The river within man*
*Is the greatest affliction,*
*From whence arise disputes,*
*And cravings that assault the body.*
*Again it says: The gates of sight, hearing, and smell,*
*If not led by desires,*
*Then throughout life,*
*There will be no restless exertion.*
*Bear’s paws—*
*The finest of tastes,*
*Should be avoided with caution."*

*Refining qi ensures eternal purity,*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"Constantly preserving*
*The harmonious and subtle qi,*
*Not letting it disperse,*
*Then in cultivating the body,*
*One will long endure*
*Without danger."*

*Guarding softness brings lasting strength,*
*Daojing* says: *"Guarding softness, daily growing strong."*
*When asked of the tree before the warm house,*
*No answer is given.*
*For it is cautious and secretive,*
*Revealing nothing of the inner sanctum.*
*Thus seeing the man of hidden virtue and goodness.*

*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"Cautious speech,*
*Moderate eating,*
*Refining qi and concealing light—*
*This makes me stand apart.*

**Chapter Fifty-Three: *The Ruler’s Modesty* (使我介然)**
*Must one believe the Dao’s simplicity is most even,*
*Yet never lose sight of its grand rule.*
*Daojing* says: *"The Dao is most even,*
*Yet men prefer shortcuts."*
*Commentary says: Even, meaning plain and natural,*
*Shortcuts, the crooked paths.*
*Saying that without the Way of non-action*
*There is no evenness,*
*Yet men themselves enter*
*The crooked paths of action.*

*Small paths are perilous and difficult,*
*The great Way is secure and easy.*

*Leisurely contemplation of lofty halls and carved walls,*
*Is it not better than*
*Lowly palaces and meager meals?*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"Exalting palaces and halls,*
*Adorning galleries and chambers,*
*Then artisans labor in abundance,*
*How can fields remain uncultivated?*
*Fields once overgrown,*
*How can granaries remain full?"*

*If cultivated virtue is neglected,*
*And martial strength is relied upon,*
*The Way’s transformation is lost.*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"If cultivated virtue is not upheld,*
*Yet martial strength is emphasized,*
*Then the Way’s natural transformation is forsaken.*
*If able to govern the nation with greatness,*
*Like the sun’s high brilliance,*
*Illuminating the ocean’s edge,*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"The Sage’s Way,*
*Its radiance like the sun,*
*Without it, there is no way to illuminate*
*The six directions.*
*The Sage does not dwell in greatness,*
*Then there is no way to benefit*
*The world under heaven."*

**Chapter Fifty-Four: *The Sage’s Foundation* (善建者不拔)**
*The foundation of the Sage is unshaken,*
*Observing Heaven’s enduring presence.*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"The Sage establishes himself and his nation*
*With virtue and the Dao—*
*This cannot be plucked away."*

*Not grinding, nor roasting,*
*Nor tasting the sacrificial meats,*
*Extending the lineage of the altars.*
*Daojing* says: *"Descendants’ sacrifices shall not cease."*
*For the altars’ lineage is vast and unbroken.*
*The ruler’s trust and ministers’ loyalty*
*Flourish through great virtue,*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"If the Dao is cultivated within the nation,*
*Then the ruler is trusted,*
*Ministers are loyal,*
*And the seven bonds naturally arise."*

*Honoring the elderly,*
*Cherishing the young,*
*And instructing the ignorant*
*Display the Sage’s enduring virtue,*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"If the Dao is cultivated in the village,*
*Honoring elders,*
*Loving and nurturing the young,*
*Teaching the foolish,*
*His virtue is longest-lasting,*
*Unmatched in excellence."*

*Water returns to the Azure Sea,*
*Its robes hanging daily—*
*The zither calls forth the fragrant wind,*
*Nurturing all things year after year.*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"The nation that cultivates the Dao,*
*Observing the nation that does not,*
*Thus with the virtue of Tang and Yu,*
*It can discern the crimes of Jie and Zhou,*
*Certainly able to govern well,*
*And bring prosperity to the age."*

*Following the Dao’s non-action,*
*Overseeing the great treasure,*
*Endless blue sky holds the star of longevity.*
*If one follows the Dao’s purity and tranquility,*
*And governs the great treasure,*
*Then the star of longevity’s auspice shall appear.*

**Chapter Fifty-Five: *The Depth of Virtue* (含德之厚)**
*Virtue fully contained,*
*True as the innocent babe,*
*Daojing’s* commentary says: *"The perfect man*
*Embraces the depth of virtue and the Dao,*
*His conduct like that of an infant."*

*First teaching the three poisons,*
*Dissolving the pure and harmonious.*

「注云：含德淳厚之人，万应不干於心神，
*The commentary states: Those of profound and pure virtue,*
*All responses of the myriad things leave no trace on their mind and spirit.*

可以比赤子者，淳和全於外，
*They may be likened to an infant,*
*Whose purity and harmony are complete in outward conduct.*

至德怀於内。
*While their supreme virtue is held within.*

以毒虫喻咦，
*Using venomous creatures as metaphors for greed,*

猛兽喻痴，
*And fierce beasts to represent delusion,*

攫乌喻食。
*And predatory crows to symbolize gluttony.*

绝此三毒，故不为其所伤。
*To sever these three poisons*
*Is why they are not harmed by them.*

张良绝粒遗轩冕，
*Zhang Liang abandoned food to reject imperial office,*
*许迈修身隐薜萝.*
*Xu Mai cultivated his body and hid in the bamboo groves.*

汉张良绝粒，
*Zhang Liang of the Han dynasty abandoned food,*
从赤松子道。
*Following the Dao of Chi Songzi.*

晋许迈修道，
*Xu Mai of the Jin dynasty cultivated the Dao,*
周游山水之胜境，不远万里。
*Roaming the finest landscapes of mountains and waters,*
*He did not hesitate to travel ten thousand miles.*

了悟真常宗道少，
*Those who awaken to the True and Eternal Dao*
*Are few in number,*

萦贪爵禄益生多。
*While those entangled in craving titles and wealth*
*Increase daily.*

《德经》注云：人能知和气柔弱有益於人，
*The commentary of the Daojing states:*
*If one knows that gentle and yielding qi*
*Is beneficial to others,*

则为深知道德真常之用。
*Then they have deeply grasped the Dao’s*
*Virtue and the True and Eternal Way.*

又云：众人以争竞爵禄，
*It further states:*
*The common folk vie for titles and wealth,*
荣达日增，
*With their glory and power growing daily,*

不知守常而求道，
*Yet they do not know to preserve constancy*
*And seek the Dao,*

益生过分，
*But instead, their growth becomes excessive,*
动之死地。
*Leading them to their own destruction.*

莫矜物壮强粱志，
*Do not boast of the vigor of things,*
*Nor cling to the pride of strength,*
衰老相随事若何。
*For decay and old age follow closely—*
*What then will be their fate?*

《德经》注云：物壮极则衰老，
*The commentary of the Daojing states:*
*When things reach their peak of vigor,*
*Decay and old age inevitably follow,*

故戒之矜壮。
*Thus, one must be warned against pride in strength.*

恃强之人，是谓不合於道也。
*Those who rely on strength*
*Are said to not align with the Dao.*

知者不言章第五十六
**Chapter Fifty-Six: *The Silent Sage* (知者不言)**

知者不言绿了悟，
*The sage who knows speaks not,*
*Yet his understanding is clear as jade.*
碧鸡强辩岂能知。
*While the blue rooster boasts eloquence,*
*It surely lacks true wisdom.*

《德经》注云：道无形象，
*The commentary of the Daojing states:*
*The Dao has no form,*
盖非言说所及，
*It cannot be grasped through words.*
唯证悟者知之。
*Only those who awaken to it truly know.*

亲疏匪得垂蕾买鹤，
*Neither partiality nor detachment can be likened*
*To the trailing orchid or the purchased crane,*

《德经》注云：玄同无私，
*The commentary states:*
*The Mysterious Unity knows no favoritism,*
故不可得而亲。
*Thus, it cannot be approached as something beloved.*

又注云：泛然和众，
*It further states:*
*It is universally harmonious with all,*
故不可得而疏。
*Thus, it cannot be rejected as something distant.*

利害难侵曳尾龟。
*The tortoise with its trailing tail*
*Is hard to harm or benefit,*

《德经》云：不可得而利，不可得而害也。
*The Daojing states:*
*It cannot be taken for gain,*
*Nor can it be harmed.*

箕岫坚辞神器处，
*Xu You declined the sacred office at Ji’s summit,*
桐江还应客星时。
*And Yan Ling returned to the fishing pools of Tong River,*
*When the guest star’s honor was offered.*

《德经》注云：体道自然，
*The commentary states:*
*Those who embody the Dao act spontaneously,*
故不可得而贵。
*Thus, they cannot be exalted by others.*

许由隐於箕山，
*Xu You hid at Mount Ji,*
尧让天下於由，坚辞不受。
*When Yao offered him the world,*
*He firmly declined.*

严陵与汉光武有旧，
*Yan Ling had ties with Emperor Guangwu of Han,*
素不乐客星之贵，
*Yet he never relished the honor of a guest star,*
却还钓渚之时，
*Instead returning to his fishing nets,*
盖不可得而贵。
*For he could not be truly exalted.*

销除爱染清襟素，
*Having extinguished all attachment,*
*His chest is clear and unadorned,*
道德尊高出世姿。
*His Dao and virtue are exalted,*
*And he stands beyond the world.*

《德经》注云：既无爱染，
*The commentary states:*
*When there is no attachment,*
则嗜欲之门闭矣。
*Then the gate of craving is closed.*

又注云：既不可得亲疏，
*It further states:*
*When neither partiality nor detachment can be obtained,*
又不可得利害，
*Nor can gain or harm be seized,*
不可得贵，
*Nor can one be exalted,*
不可得贱，
*Nor debased,*
是为天下贵，
*This is to be the most noble in the world,*
道德自更尊高也。
*For his Dao and virtue are naturally most exalted.*

以政理国章第五十七
**Chapter Fifty-Seven: *Governance Through Non-Action* (以政理国)**

垂衣治国固元事，
*To govern the nation with sleeves hanging loose*
*Is indeed the fundamental way,*
以无事取天下。
*The Daojing states:*
*To take the world through non-action.*

哲后忘情化自清。
*The sage ruler, forgetting his own passions,*
*Transforms himself into purity.*

《德经》注云：圣人之道，
*The commentary states:*
*The Dao of the sage,*
嗜欲不干於心，
*Has no cravings that disturb the mind,*
则奢溢绮靡之物安所用之？
*Then where would he find use for*
*Luxurious, extravagant, or ornate things?*
以此化人，自朴淳矣。
*Through this transformation of others,*
*He himself becomes simple and pure.*

去盗不因刑网密，
*To eliminate thieves without relying on strict laws,*
法令滋章，盗贼多有也。
*The Daojing states:*
*When laws and decrees proliferate,*
*Thieves and robbers abound.*

安时须是赋舆轻。
*To ensure peace in one’s time,*
*One must lighten the burdens of the people.*

天下多忌讳，
*The Daojing states:*
*The world is full of prohibitions,*
而民弥贫。
*Yet the people grow ever poorer.*
注云：谓禁令多端，
*The commentary states:*
*It means that there are many restrictions,*
山泽所资有无，皆禁止之，
*Whether the resources of mountains and waters*
*Are present or absent,*
悉加繁税，
*All are prohibited and subjected to heavy taxation,*
而焉得不至弥贫也。
*How then could the people not grow ever poorer?*

淳如尧酒皇风远，
*His purity is like that of Yao’s*
*Unadorned and distant imperial style,*
政教无为宽大，
*The Daojing states:*
*When governance and teaching are without action,*
*Yet expansive and broad,*
则民应之淳朴也。
*The people respond with simplicity and purity.*

静似昊江素月明。
*His stillness is like the bright, unadorned moon*
*Over the vast river.*

我好静而民自正。
*The Daojing states:*
*If I love stillness,*
*The people will naturally be upright.*

何必使民成缺缺，
*Why must I make the people*
*Like the crippled and maimed?*
万机宽大慰苍生。
*Let all affairs be broad and generous,*
*To comfort the people of the world.*

其政察察章第五十八
**Chapter Fifty-Eight: *The Overbearing Ruler* (其政闷闷)**

祸福同途分倚伏，
*Calamity and fortune share the same path,*
*Yet differ in their reliance and concealment.*
《德经》云：祸兮福之所倚，
*The Daojing states:*
*Calamity, oh,*
福兮祸之所伏。
*Fortune is where calamity lies hidden,*
福兮祸之所伏。
*And fortune, oh,*
*Is where calamity is concealed.*

圣人明德内含光。
*The sage’s virtue is bright yet unblinding,*
《德经》云：光而不耀。
*The Daojing states:*
*Light without dazzling.*
又注云：圣人虽有独见之明，
*The commentary further states:*
*Though the sage may possess*
*Unique and penetrating insight,*
常自晦昧，
*He always remains humble and obscure,*
不以耀乱於人。
*Not dazzling others with his brilliance.*

山栖一旅翻强盛，
*A single troop taking refuge in the mountains*
*Turns to flourishing strength,*
台筑九层俄败亡。
*While a nine-tiered tower built in triumph*
*Soon crumbles into ruin.*

越王为吴王所败，
*King Yue of Yue was defeated by King Fu of Wu,*
势穷，以余兵栖於会稽山，
*With his forces exhausted,*
*He sheltered his remaining troops at Mount Kuai Ji,*
用范蠡计释越而还。
*Following Fan Li’s counsel,*
*He let go of Yue and returned.*
吴王既胜越，
*King Fu, having conquered Yue,*
筑九层之台，
*Built a nine-tiered tower,*
悦西施之貌，
*Delighted in the beauty of Xi Shi,*
况伍员之尸，
*And even more so,*
*He placed the corpse of Wu Yan,*
会赵鞅之盟，
*And formed an alliance with Zhao Yang,*
仁德不修，
*Yet he did not cultivate virtue,*
寻为越报仇。
*And soon, Yue avenged itself.*
一旦败亡，
*In a single day,*
俄成丘墟也。
*He became a mound of ruins.*

「因寻 赋深微理，天地为炉不可量。
*Thus, he composed a profound and subtle *Fu* (rhapsody),
*Where the heavens and earth are like a furnace—*
*Boundless in its vastness.*

贾谊初谪长沙之时，
*When Jia Yi was first banished to Changsha,*
以失志之际，
*At a time when his ambitions were thwarted,*
湘中地多卑湿，
*The land of Xiang (Changsha) was low and damp,*
方有疑惧，
*And he harbored doubts and fears,*
而有集合。
*Yet he found solace in reflection.*
鹤乃南中怪乌，
*The crane is a strange bird of the southern lands,*
人皆深忌。
*One that all men hold in deep suspicion.*
谊以势穷道塞，
*Yi, seeing his fortunes exhausted*
*And the Dao/Way blocked,*
遂制《赋》，
*Composed a *Fu* (rhapsody),*
定以生死之分，
*To fix upon the distinction between life and death,*
达於穷通之理。
*And to expound upon the principles of adversity and fortune.*
赋中有天地为炉之句。
*Within the *Fu* (rhapsody) is the line,*
*Where the heavens and earth become a furnace.*
盖欲明委心於天，
*He wished to make clear*
*The surrender of one’s heart to Heaven,*
莫测倚伏之理。
*And the unfathomable logic of rise and fall.*
后果出殊邦，
*Later, indeed, he departed to a distant land,*
却还丹阙也。
*Yet returned to the imperial court.*

治人事天章第五十九
*Chapter Fifty-Nine on Governing the People and Serving Heaven*

治世莫如宗啬爱，
*In governing the world,*
*There is nothing better than adhering to frugality and love.*
《德经》云：
*The *De Jing* (Scripture of Virtue) says:*
治人事天莫若啬。
*"In governing the people and serving Heaven,*
*There is nothing better than frugality."*
注云：
*A note says:*
音，爱也。
*"Frugality" (啬) is pronounced as "love" (爱).*
人君将欲治人事天，
*When a ruler seeks to govern the people and serve Heaven,*
莫若爱费，
*There is nothing better than loving economy,*

*Ensuring granaries are full and stores abundant,*
人知礼节，
*The people know propriety and decorum,*
三时不害，
*And no season brings them harm,*
则天降之嘉祥。
*Then Heaven will bestow its blessings upon him.*
德弘卑服保皇居。
*Virtue expands, humility prevails,*
*And the royal throne is secured.*

《德经》注云：
*The note on the *De Jing* (Scripture of Virtue) says:*
圣主贤臣，
*"Sage rulers and virtuous ministers*
常以卑服，
*Always practice humility,*
悉从音爱之道也。
*And all follow the Way of love (frugality).*

惜狐裘处身元玷，
*Treasure the fox-fur robe, wear it with care,*
*And let no stain mar its purity.*
《德经》注云：
*The note on the *De Jing* (Scripture of Virtue) says:*
晏子狐裘三十年，
*"Yan Zi wore his fox-fur robe for thirty years,*
此明贤臣音爱之道。
*This illustrates the virtuous minister’s adherence to the Way of love (frugality).*

罢露台时俭有余。
*When the Terrace of Emptiness was abandoned,*
*Frugality was practiced with even greater abundance.*

汉文帝检德，
*Emperor Wen of Han examined his virtue,*
闻筑露台，
*And heard of the construction of the Terrace of Emptiness,*
帝曰：
*The emperor said:*
可比十家之产。
*"It can be compared to the wealth of ten households."*
寻令罢之。
*Soon, he ordered its cessation.*
损己敷恩人景附，
*To diminish his own excess*
*And spread benevolence among the people,*
*Is a reflection of the Sage’s virtue.*

《德经》注云：圣人损己有余，以奉人之不足也。
*The note on the *De Jing* says:*
*The Sage diminishes himself to have abundance,*
*To bestow upon the people’s insufficiency.*

穷奢黜武国空虚。
*Exhausting luxury and discarding martial prowess,*
*The realm becomes hollow and void.*

恃四海一家，兵力强富，遂穷军势於云中，继访神仙於海上，帑藏空虚，生民疲疗也。
*Relying on the Four Seas as one family,*
*With strong military might and boundless wealth,*
*He exhausted his armies at Yunjung,*
*Then sought immortals upon the seas.*
*The imperial treasuries were drained,*
*The common folk weary and exhausted.*

探根固蒂长生理，
*To probe the roots and secure the foundation*
*Of the principle of eternal life.*

《德经》注云：音爱克己之行，以成治人事天之德。
*The note on the *De Jing* says:*
*The practice of frugality and self-restraint,*
*To fulfill the virtue of governing the people*
*And serving the Dao/Way.*

帝王流而行之，非惟深根固蒂以有其国，
*The emperors and kings followed this practice,*
*Not only to establish deep-rooted stability within their realm,*
亦乃长生久视，乘彼白云，至于帝乡。
*But also to attain eternal life and longevity,*
*Riding upon the white clouds,*
*To reach the Celestial Abode.*

黄帝其人也。
*This was the Way of the Yellow Emperor.*

不假文成自献书。
*He did not rely on scholars like Wen Cheng*
*To offer his own writings.*

汉武之时，有李少黄自上书言有神仙之衍。
*During Emperor Wu of Han’s reign,*
*There was Li Shao Huang who submitted a petition,*
*Claiming the existence of immortals.*

遂拜文成将军。
*Thus, he was appointed as General Wen Cheng.*

后以饰书於牛腹，诈令剖出，验其伪迹，因乃诛之矣。
*Later, he falsely inscribed texts upon a cow’s belly,*
*And deceptively ordered it to be slit open,*
*Its fraud exposed,*
*And he was executed.*

治大国章第六十
*Chapter Sixty of the *Treatise on Governing Great States*:*
道莅寰区绝妄求，
*The Dao/Way arrives in the world,*
*Ceasing all vain and excessive desires,*
鬼神无害服皇猷。
*The spirits and gods cause no harm,*
*As the grand purpose of the Sage is fulfilled.*

「The *Daodejing* commentary states:
*To govern the world with the Dao,*
*One does not seek the vain and excessive blessings.*
*Thus, the spirits and gods manifest to reveal its divine clarity.*

*Qin’s arrogance and fierce gaze over the Three Prefectures,*
*Yu’s carving of the Dragon Gate to safeguard the Nine Regions.*

The *Daodejing* commentary states:
*The *Zhou Shu* says:*
*Perfect governance exudes fragrant virtue,*
*Resonating with the divine clarity.*
*Millet and barley are not fragrant,*
*Yet the virtue of the Sage alone is fragrant.*

*What is called the Sage’s perfect governance,*
*Is nothing more urgent than rescuing living beings.*
*The fragrant virtue of the Sage’s clarity*
*Moves heaven and earth,*
*Not only ensuring wealth and longevity without bounds,*
*But also securing enduring blessings and boundless reverence.*

*Qin’s fierce gaze toward the Eastern Pass,*
*Uncultivated in virtue,*
*Was ultimately extinguished by Liu Bang and Xiang Yu.*
*Yu’s carving of the Dragon Gate,*
*Guiding the hundred rivers to the sea,*
*Reviving the people of the Nine Regions,*
*Truly embodies the essence of rescue.*

*The moon aids the lute in tuning the endless night,*
*The rain envelops the round pool in the serene autumn.*

The *Daodejing* commentary states:
*The intent of this chapter*
*Should be centered on perfect governance and tranquil rectitude.*
*Now, the lute signifies adherence to rectitude,*
*The autumn signifies clarity and stillness,*
*Using events to illustrate principles.*

*After the harmonious transformation where none are harmed,*
*There arises the noble qi of the *qingyun* clouds.*
*The *Daodejing* states:*
*The gods of the Dao do not harm the people,*
*Nor does the Sage harm the people.*

**Chapter Sixty-One of the *Treatise on Governing Great States*:**
*When the great sea is humble, all rivers flow to it.*
*The *Daodejing* commentary states:*
*The great sea is lowly,*
*And the hundred rivers naturally flow to it.*
*A great state’s humility and deference,*
*And the myriad lands naturally submit to it.*

*Gentleness and stillness hold the heart,*
*Embodying the principle of transcending the world.*
*The *Daodejing* commentary states:*
*If a ruler of a great state maintains gentleness and stillness,*
*The world will unite in harmony and return to it.*

*A great state’s humility and deference flourish the Sage’s Dao,*
*All feudal lords gaze reverently toward the imperial court.*
*The *Daodejing* states:*
*A great state that upholds the virtue of humility*
*And looks down upon lesser states*
*Is merely seeking to annex and subjugate them.*

*Lesser states seizing upon greater states*
*Is to rely on power and advantage.*

*Jin Wen’s repayment to Chu ultimately made him a hegemon,*
*Idong Hu’s refusal of Qi cost him his opportunity.*
*Before Jin Wen entered his state,*
*He once traveled through Chu.*
*Chu honored him,*
*And the Chu king asked Wen,*
*What would you repay me for in the future?*
*Wen said:*
*If I encounter Chu’s army,*
*I will retreat three stages.*
*Later, upon returning home,*
*He met Chu’s army,*
*And did not betray his promise,*
*Ultimately becoming the leader of the alliance.*

*Idong Hu had merit with Qi,*
*Yet Qi sought to marry him.*
*Hu declined,*
*Saying a small state should not ally with a great one,*
*And rejected their offer.*
*Later, he was driven out by Cai Zhong,*
*And lacked the support of other feudal lords,*
*Thus losing his opportunity.*

*Without negligence or waste,*
*The great virtue is vast,*
*Yet the heart of the humble never forgets*
*The Sage’s vigilant night robes.*

The *Daodejing* commentary states:
*A great state must always guard against fullness and excess.*

**Chapter Sixty-Two of the *Treatise on Governing Great States*:**
*The Dao/Way is the profound mystery of all things,*
*Its depths must be explored.*
*One must recognize*
*The virtue of humility and purity,*
*And rise above the dust of the world.*

*The *Daodejing* states:*
*The Dao/Way is the profound mystery of all things.*

*Those with expansive Dao-heart*
*And the few who reach enlightenment,*
*Assist the effortless sovereign*
*As virtuous ministers.*

The commentary states:
*Unless one is of the utmost Dao and great goodness,*
*How could they value profound mysteries and treasures,*
*And have the resolve to save others?*

*Again, the text states:*
*Therefore, the Son of Heaven establishes the Three Dukes,*
*To teach those who are not yet good.*

*It is essential to rescue all beings with sweet words,*
*And gently guide those whose roots are lost,*
*Who are not yet good.*

The commentary states:
*The Sage uses sweet and appealing words of law,*
*And honors high and pure conduct,*
*To transform those who are not yet good.*

*Guilt and suffering are forever erased,*
*When one awakens to the truth,*
*And the phoenix and crane of the Jade Capital*
*Naturally draw near.*

The commentary states:
*The Dao lies in awakening,*
*Not in seeking.*
*Once awakened,*
*There is no guilt or suffering,*
*And one must surely grasp the principle of emptiness.*

**Chapter Sixty-Three of the *Treatise on Governing Great States*:**
*The Sage acts in accordance with circumstances,*
*Yet remains free from worldly scheming.*

The commentary states:
*The common folk act in accordance with circumstances,*
*Yet create more affairs.*
*The Dao acts in accordance with circumstances,*
*Yet ceases affairs.*

*The taste of the Dao is free from greed,*
*And from thoughts of the mundane.*

The commentary states:
*The taste of the Dao is not the vulgar taste of the world,*
*And even the Dao’s taste should not be greedily sought,*
*How much more so the vulgar tastes of the world?*

*Yet, one must steadfastly maintain a humble heart,*
*And diligently uphold one’s word.*
*The *Daodejing* states:*
*Light promises and few trustworthy words.*
*One has never hated in leisure,*
*Nor remembered faults in repose.*

*The *Daodejing* states:*
*Great and small, all have defects,*
*Yet repay hatred with virtue.*

*It is essential to pacify the myriad multitudes,*
*And harmonize the winds of the world,*
*Forever to restrain the Three Miao*
*From their dancing with feathers.*

The commentary states:
*The Sage’s creations are effortless,*
*Yet bring about transformations without effort.*
*Though Yu of the Xia harmonized the winds*
*And danced with dry feathers,*
*He achieved effortless transformations through his actions.*

*Why should King Mu of Zhou*
*Meet at the Yao Pool,*
*When Yu of the Xia maintained purity in his simplicity,*
*And thus reached the Dao?*
*King Mu of Zhou met at the Yao Pool,*
*His chariot wheels and horses’ tracks*
*Covering the four seas,*
*Yet he only sought vain and excessive desires,*
*And failed to embody purity and stillness.*

**Chapter Sixty-Four of the *Treatise on Governing Great States*:**
*Peace and stillness are easy to maintain,*
*Yet perfect for cultivating the self.*

The commentary states:
*To cultivate the self and govern the state,*
*Peace and stillness are the easiest to uphold.*

*At the outset,*
*One must divide and conquer*
*The desires that may topple anger.*

The commentary states:
*Desires bring calamity,*
*And when they have not yet taken form,*
*They are easiest to stop.*

*When a tree reaches its full height,*
*It begins as a tiny sprout,*
*And when a tower is built,*
*It starts with a single shovelful of earth.*

*The *Daodejing* states:*
*A tree with arms wide enough to embrace*
*Grows from a tiny sprout.*
*It also states:*
*A nine-tiered tower*
*Rises from piled earth.*

*Zhao’s master could not lightly value state treasures,*
*Dong Zhongshu must emphasize the importance of words.*

*The *Daodejing* states:*
*Do not prize what is hard to obtain.*
*Its commentary states:*
*The common folk study vulgar learning,*
*What is called pursuing heterodox ends.*

*The Sage follows the Dao’s original effortlessness,*
*Thus learning from what is not learned.*
*Is this not a remedy for the faults*
*Of the common folk’s heterodox pursuits?*

*Zhao Wang ordered Lan Si to deliver a jade to Qin,*
*Seeking its price in connected cities,*
*This was to prize what is hard to obtain,*
*And to neglect the Dao’s intent.»*

「How could one prevent Dong Zhongshu from withdrawing behind his curtains to study,
Seeking worldly gain—
Its certainty is already known.

Cautious to the end as at the beginning, there will be no failure;
Cherish the spirit, beware of excessive action.

*The Daodejing* states:
*"Cautious to the end as at the beginning, there will be no failure."*
Its commentary states:
*"To act upon desires exhausts the spirit."*

In ancient times, those skilled in the *Daodejing*’s sixth chapter:
Lured the people to remain in ignorance, extinguishing emotions like withered trees.
*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:
*"The ancients skilled in the Dao did not enlighten the people—
They sought to keep them in ignorance."*

Without the delusions of wisdom, anger, and ignorance,
Only the true wind stirs, calming the four quarters.

*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:
*"Noble sages and virtuous rulers govern by the Dao’s original simplicity,
Ever preserving naturalness and simplicity."*

The ignorant of antiquity did not allow clever schemers
To taint the wise with their artifices,
Lest they confuse true nature.

Again, the *Daodejing* states:
*"The difficulty in governing the people lies in their excess of wisdom."*

With reverence for the Dao’s greatness, he accomplished nothing yet illuminated vast plans.
The Yellow Emperor governed thus—
His merit ascended, riding clouds from the Cauldron Lake.

*The Daodejing* states:
*"To govern without wisdom is the state’s blessing."*
The Yellow Emperor followed the Dao without action,
Nurturing the four quarters,
Later ascending to the Cauldron Lake upon white clouds,
Reaching the imperial realm.

**Chapter 66: The River and Sea as King of All Valleys**
The river and sea, honored as king of all valleys,
Flow downward, never against the current—vast and boundless.
A voyage unfurls, swaying with the wind’s might,
As dawn’s sun rises, bathing in morning light.
Crashing against celestial stars, waves surge wide,
The path opens to the boundless blue, waves surging high.

If a ruler follows the virtue of humility,
All nations joyfully uphold his enduring prosperity.

*The Daodejing* states:
*"The river and sea become king of all valleys
Because they excel in yielding.
Thus, the Sage desires to elevate others—
He speaks in humility.
He desires to lead others—
He places himself last.
Thus, though exalted, none resent him;
Though first, none harm him.
Thus, the world willingly follows without burden.
Because he does not contend, none can contend with him."*

**Chapter 67: The World’s Judgment**
Neither wise nor foolish—seeming unworthy,
*The Daodejing* states:
*"The world all say my Dao is great—
It seems unworthy."*
Its commentary states:
*"Not resembling wisdom, not resembling foolishness,
Different from others—
Thus, it is called unworthy."*

Ever holding the Three Treasures, the true wind stirs.
*The Daodejing* states:
*"I possess three treasures—
Guard and uphold them.
First, compassion;
Second, frugality;
Third, not daring to act before the world."*

Frugality achieves abundance without excess,
Compassion rescues all living beings with great merit.
*(As noted above.)*

Ren’s virtue harmonizes the central lands,
The Dao’s essence aligns with the Supreme Mystery.

*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:
*"The compassionate and virtuous—
The people naturally attach themselves."*
Again, it states:
*"If a ruler practices these three treasures,
Then heaven, earth, and spirits will surely assist and protect."*

Strong Qin abandoned these principles in vain,
Building its foundation—
Yet in one day, all was empty.

*The Daodejing* states:
*"Now, gathering compassion and courage,
Gathering frugality and breadth,
Gathering humility and precedence—
Death awaits."*
Qin Shi Huang gathered the Three Treasures,
Relying on cleverness and force—
His dynasty did not endure.

Alas.

**Chapter 68: The Virtuous Scholar**

「Expounding the Dao never relies on martial might,
*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:
*"Hold virtue and the Way in high esteem,
Do not valorize force.
Use the subtle and yielding to transform things,
Not the rigid and fierce to subdue people."*
It is not through wrath that campaigns are launched.

*The Daodejing* states:
*"The skilled warrior does not rage."*

Yu the Great’s dance of feathers and dryads brought harmony,
The Three Miao submitted in peace.
King Wu of Zhou honored the Duke of Zhou beneath the *yǒu’ōu* banner,
The army marched only after the sage’s counsel.
Xiang Yu, in his haste, fled that night,
Xiang Yu’s forces were crushed at Gaixia,
Hearing the encircling Chu songs,
He knew the Chu troops were all now in Han’s grasp.
Thus, he parted from his concubine in the tent,
And fled into the night.
When he still relied on strength and indulged his ambitions,
Who could foresee the night of defeat?
Alas.

Fú Jiān, at least, considered retreat when facing defeat.
Fú Jiān led a million-strong army against the Eastern Jin,
Rejecting Wang Mèng’s advice,
Ignoring the calamity of the Lìshuǐ River.
At the time of his retreat after the Lìshuǐ defeat,
Hearing the wind’s cry like a crane’s call,
He mistook it for the Jin army’s approach.
Was he not too careless?
One must know that military ventures are not lightly undertaken;
The four virtues still could pacify the Nine Borders.
*The Daodejing* states:
*"The virtuous scholar does not wield arms,
The skilled warrior does not rage,
The master of victory does not contend,
The sage in using men places himself beneath them."*

**Chapter 69: The Virtue of Caution in War**
When acting as a guest, maintain humility,
Ever guard the path of retreat.
*The Daodejing* states:
*"I dare not take the lead but only follow,
I dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot."*

The *rǎngbì* is powerless—be cautious with military orders.
*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:
*"The act of rolling up one’s sleeves signifies anger;
The skilled warrior does not rage, hence no rolling up of sleeves."*

Ren’s compassion and foresight are the perfect strategy,
Contempt breeds ruin and forsakes grand designs.
*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:
*"Let compassion be the master."*
Again, it states:
*"No disaster greater than scorning the enemy."*

Empty threats echo like hollow bells over Yue,
Yet he failed to grasp the deer and hare’s flight to Gusu.
King Gou of Wu, overconfident in his strength,
Held Yue in contempt,
Unmindful that power fades and nations fall—
At Gusu, the deer and hare wandered empty.
Do not let the loss of treasure violate profound truth,
*The Daodejing* states:
*"Scorning the enemy risks losing all five treasures."*

Adapt to circumstances, act with subtlety, and bring peace to the four quarters.
*The Daodejing*’s commentary states:
*"When the enemy bends, do not strike;
When they are straight, respond with force—
Though you hold your troops ready,
Your intent is never to harm.
My words are simple yet profound."*

**Chapter 70: The Supreme Sage’s Clear Doctrine**

*The Daodejing* says: *"My words are simple yet profound,
Easy to know yet difficult to practice.
Those who cannot know and cannot practice—*
*The Daodejing* states: *"Few in the world can know or practice them."*

The blind gaze at the splendor of a fallen kingdom’s silks,
The deafened are lost to the alluring melodies of Zheng and Wei.
Unquenched passions darken the form, like chains of favor that cloud the mind—
*The Daodejing’s* commentary explains: *"Confused by lust, they cannot know;
Ensnared by glory and gain, they cannot practice."*

The humble in coarse robes, yet treasuring virtue within, sink deep in stillness—
Yet even they, when weighed by worldly currents, fail to see the eternal truth.
*The Daodejing’s* commentary states: *"The coarse-clad obscure the outer,
The virtuous-clad discern the inner—
Thus, few truly understand me."*

**Chapter 70 (continued):**
*Knowing yet feigning ignorance—this is the highest virtue.*
*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *"The Sage knows the Dao within,
Yet outwardly appears as though he does not—
This is the virtue’s peak."*

*Feigning knowledge while ignorant—this is the sickness of empty words.*
*The Daodejing’s* commentary states: *"To claim knowledge without understanding
Is the root of vain speech’s affliction."*

Though common folk may fail to grasp the eternal realm,
The Saints ever open the gate of benefit and salvation.
Guard tranquility to preserve boundless *qi*,
Pity the greedy, pointing them toward their deluded roots.
In accord with nature, rescue all beings—
The Sage’s mercy spans the heavens, vast as his embrace.
*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *"The Sage knows no sickness of forced understanding,
For he pities all beings, who share this flaw—
Thus, he himself cannot be afflicted."*

---

**Chapter 72: The Sage’s Non-Fear**
Men fear not threats when threats become their rule.
*The Daodejing* states: *"If men do not fear great threats,
Then greater threats shall come."*

Let the mind be empty and pure—then the spirit dwells.
*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *"The spirit’s home is the mind.
Cast aside emotions, purge desires,
Let emptiness bloom with clarity—
Right and wrong reveal themselves;
The body bears no blame."*

The Sage knows his own merit and demerit within,
Yet sees no outward praise or censure.
His vital *qi* ever full, the Dao overflows.
Sleeping, he dreams of Zhuangzi’s carefree butterflies;
Awakened, he rejoices in Hui Shi’s fish of joy.
*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *"He guards himself from dreadful deeds,
Loves his spirit’s purity—
Thus, no fault of driving the spirit away."*

So it is—
The butterflies of Zhuang and the fish of Hui
Spring forth as pleasures beyond the dust.

Those who shun arrogance and pride, hiding their virtue,
Close their doors when snow blocks the three paths.
*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *"He does not boast of noble status or worldly fame.
Yuan An, when snow fell, sealed his gate—
Avoiding all entanglement."*

---

**Chapter 73: The Sage’s Boldness**
Boldness in daring to slay those who defy Heaven’s Way—
*The Daodejing’s* commentary asks: *"How can this compare to self-destruction?"*
For those without *ren* (benevolence),
Who scorn the retribution of Heaven’s law,
Begin with reckless daring—
To kill is to court their own demise.
When death is certain, who then dares?
Thus, the bold who kill are like those who kill themselves.

Ever restrain the fierce—this preserves the life.
*The Daodejing* says: *"The daring who do not dare shall live."*

Fear of harm, if the mind can cast aside confusion—
*The Daodejing’s* commentary states: *"Daring and restraint:
The one who spares himself lives;
The one who harms himself dies.*
No idle words, yet goodness responds.
The world may pity the modest and humble,
But Heaven’s net favors the strong and resolute.
*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *"Though Heaven’s net is vast and distant,
Its punishments for vice and rewards for virtue
Fail not even by a hair’s breadth.*

Look to the banks of Wujiang—
The might to uproot mountains faded to dust.
Xiang Yu held the power to move mountains,
Yet all perished at Wujiang’s edge.
Men do not fear death—
How can they be coerced by threats?
*The Daodejing’s* commentary says: *"Given to passions, drawn into peril,
Death becomes their habit—
Yet still, they fear not."*

A ruler should transform with clarity and stillness.
Why impose new laws of punishment?
Why frighten them with constant fear of death?
Emperor Wen of Han abhorred harsh laws, following the Five Hearings.
In the time of Emperor Wen of Han,
He ruled by the Yellow Emperor-Laozi’s teachings,
Nearly abolishing punishments—
This was truly to follow the Five Hearings.
High Emperor Gaozu’s lenient laws were but three chapters.
When Emperor Gaozu first entered the Pass,
He made three simple laws with the elders:
‘Whoever kills shall die;
Whoever wounds or steals shall be punished—
All other Qin laws are hereby removed.’
The people lived in peace, secure in their homes.
To follow Heaven, govern with nature—
Then men shall transform of their own accord.

「The *Daodejing* commentary states: If a ruler guides the people with few desires and governs with stillness and non-action, then the people will cherish life and all fear death.
The clumsy carpenter wounds his own hands while shaping materials.

The *Daodejing* commentary states: A ruler acts as Heaven’s agent in governing the world. If punishment is not justly applied, it is like a clumsy artisan attempting to forge a new vessel—how could he avoid marring his hands, not to mention failing to achieve the proper shape? Can one not be cautious?

When the tripod was cast with success, virtue was divided—
Climbing the Dragon’s beard to leave the White Cloud Realm.
In the age of the Yellow Emperor’s governance,
He broadened his saving compassion to its fullest,
Not only did the four quarters live in peace and follow transformation,
But also the tripod was cast in perfection,
Heaven bestowed the Dragon’s beard,
Riding upon the White Clouds,
Ascending to the imperial domain.

**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**
A ruler’s extravagance brings the people’s hunger.
The *Daodejing* commentary states: The people of the world suffer from hunger and want because their lords and rulers consume too much and tax them excessively.

The hard-to-govern return to green policies with active rule.
The *Daodejing* states: The people are hard to govern because their rulers act excessively. Therefore, they are hard to govern.

Those in high station seek abundance, while the destitute grow weary and lean.
The *Daodejing* commentary states: Those in power cannot restrain their own actions; thus, they drain the lower ranks to benefit themselves, exhausting the common folk so they cannot provide tribute. Since life is not cherished, death becomes a trivial matter.

Pushed by rank and wealth, the heartless follow.
The *Daodejing* commentary states: Those who care nothing for life—rank and wealth mean nothing to them, nor do riches enter their hearts. They let things take their course, embracing emptiness with open mind.

The courtyard filled with broom and grass sustains their nature.
The *Daodejing* commentary states: Though poor and lowly, they do not harm their lives for profit.
Zhang Zhongyu’s dwelling was overgrown with broom and grass.

Until the robe of office is hung, virtue spreads naturally—
The foundation of eternal peace is unshaken.
If a ruler governs by hanging his robe and elucidating transformation,
requiring nothing from the people, they will be self-sufficient—
this is indeed the firm basis of lasting peace.

**Chapter 76: The People’s Life**
Grasses and trees flourish, spreading thick shade—
The *Daodejing* states: All things, grasses and trees, are soft and tender when they first grow, preserving harmonious *qi*.
Yet when they wither and decay, frost and snow invade.
The *Daodejing* states: When they die, they become brittle and dry, their harmonious *qi* dispersed.

Straight as a ten-armed embrace, they hide in secluded depths—
Yet slender branches rise above the dense forest.
The *Daodejing* commentary states: The roots are strong and sturdy, so they rest below;
The branches are weak and pliable, so they grow above.
It is as though the weak and tender flourish above,
While the strong and rigid lie beneath.
The weak and tender preserve life—this is worth heeding,
The strong and rigid lose their nature—this should alarm the heart.

The *Daodejing* commentary states: The living, in their weakness and tenderness, retain harmonious *qi* fully;
The dying, in their rigidity, lose their harmonious *qi*.
Those who guard their weakness and tenderness will preserve life and extend years,
While those who cling to strength and rigidity will perish and lose their nature.

Fu Jian’s arrogance destroyed his army—
The water’s flow was choked by deep resentment.
Fu Jian relied on his wealth and power,
Indulging his rigid and domineering nature,
And was defeated at the Fei River,
Where the water refused to flow for him,
Ultimately losing his own life.

**Chapter 77: The Dao/Way of Heaven**»
One must know that Heaven’s Dao/Way is like the string of a bow—

The *Daodejing* says: The Dao/Way of Heaven—is it not like a drawn bow?
It raises the low and suppresses the high, dividing with utmost fairness.
The *Daodejing* says: The high are suppressed, the low are raised.

Self-restraint in abundance—like dew moistening the house,
Yet constant lamentation reveals the path’s end.
The *Daodejing* says: Reduce the surplus and supplement the deficient.

Though vast the imperial work, virtue remains concealed.
The *Daodejing* commentary says: The Sage does not desire the world to know his virtue,
Hiding his deeds and merits, fearing Heaven’s Dao,
To reduce the surplus.

Broadening blessings for the people, not relying on merit.
The *Daodejing* says: The work accomplished, yet not dwelling upon it.

At Zhulú, martial might was laid aside—true *qi* endured,
Then returning in procession to seek the Kunlun peaks.
The Yellow Emperor ceased war, swimming in the Lu River,
And sought the Dao at Kunlun, meeting Guangchengzi.

**Chapter 78: The Dao/Way of Heaven’s Genuine Softness**
Square and round like water—its softness defined,
The *Daodejing* says: None are softer than water.
Yet it overcomes the rigid—logic clear.
The *Daodejing* says: The soft overcomes the hard.

Accepting defilement, extending grace—like the Sea’s embrace,
Taking responsibility, transforming all under Heaven.
The *Daodejing* commentary says: If a ruler embodies water’s virtue,
Accepting filth and defilement without hesitation,
Setting up the *Wood of Slander* and *Drum of Dare*,
This is the enlightened sovereign, the Dao-bearing sage.

Though knowing profound truths, who will truly follow?
Each hides their nature—who would act?
The *Daodejing* commentary says: Though all know the soft overcomes the hard,
None can practice it.

Duan Ganmu’s virtue—wind’s breath hard to inherit,
Retiring to high repose, halting Qin’s armies.
Duan Ganmu dwelled in Wei’s outer lands,
And Qin dared not strike Wei.

**Chapter 79: Harmonizing Great Grievances**
Heaven’s Dao favors none—blessing the virtuous,

「The *Daodejing* states: Heaven’s Dao favors none, yet always blesses the virtuous.
If one holds fast to the *Left Contract*, they shall remain untainted in truth.
The *Daodejing* says: Thus the sage clings to the *Left Contract* and does not blame others.

Though lacking in impartial justice, they shower favors alone,
Unworried by enmity or schemes to harm their person.
The *Daodejing* commentary says: Those in office cannot uphold the *Left Contract* in faith,
Thus errors arise unchecked, while they indulge in luxury within,
Ever scrutinizing others, yet harboring inner deceit,
Bringing misfortune upon themselves while seeking blessings from Heaven.
They fail to take responsibility for their own faults,
Yet mete out punishments to others.

It is like dwelling with a man’s son and slaying his father,
Or residing with a man’s brother and killing his younger sibling—
Yet still they wish to bestow rich treasures and vast honors,
To seek broad pardon and forgiveness—
Can such a one be absolved?

I endure to witness Emperor Chen abandoning his sacred trust,
Well knowing Jiang Zong was no loyal minister.
The *Hou Ting*’s foundations still stand, a stark testament,
While the *Yu Shu* blooms anew—spring from wild grass.

Emperor Chen of Chen could not uphold his trust in governing others,
But only gave free rein to his extravagance and debauchery,
Cultivating the *Hou Ting* and planting *Yu Shu* trees,
To become the envy of all under Heaven.

Jiang Zong, meanwhile, was the most favored by imperial grace,
Yet he could not rectify or save—
Instead, he erected the *San Ge* to entertain guests.
Swiftly drafting verses, he sought to emulate the *Eight Strings*,
While the *Iron Ogre* and *Golden Bowl* relied on their strength in one river alone.

Little did they know that the *Sui* ruler’s virtue was spreading,
While Chen’s heart was lost in delusion—
Soon came their downfall, a sorrowful spectacle for ages past.
Was it not Jiang Zong betraying his former favors?
Alas.

**Chapter 80: The Small State with Few People**」

The boat and carriage though never ridden,
*The Dao De Jing* says: Though there be boats and carriages, there is no place to ride them.
Yan Zi’s gourd and bamboo bowl—virtue’s grandeur unfolds.
*The Dao De Jing* commentary: The Way resides within; even Yan Zi’s coarse gourd and bamboo bowl suffice for sweetness.

Joyous to see the people return to the Domain of Longevity,
*The Dao De Jing* commentary: In an age where the world is cleansed and bright, the people are brought to the realm of benevolent life.

Laughing as armies and armor guard Jianling.
*The Dao De Jing* says: Though there be armor and weapons, there is no place to array them.
The Six Dynasties of Jiangnan all made Jianling their capital, yet they relied on arms to fortify the riverbank—far from the vast and august virtue.

Without intent, the strange customs are naturally at ease,
*The Dao De Jing* commentary: The Way resides within; even if one dwells among the Nine Barbarians, it is enough for joy.

Returning to simplicity, yet still resorting to knotted cords.
*The Dao De Jing* commentary: When governance reverts to purity, all return to simplicity, using knotted cords—truly in harmony with the Original One.

Knowing the calamity of Emperor Huai and Emperor Min of Yongjia,
Yet seeking no wise counsel—what did He Zong ever do?
The Jin Emperor Wu, at first, with his diligence and rectitude, pacified the world.
After destroying Shu, only Wu remained.
Had he heeded the strategies of Yun Yang, Zhang Hua, and Du Yu, Wu too would have fallen.
With the Six Directions pacified and all nations aligned, he could have spread the radiant and tranquil transformation, restoring the pure and simple ways.
Yet he was ensnared by the beauty of Sun Hao’s concubines, doted on Emperor Hui’s frailty, lost in the present, and forgot the distant horizon.
He Zong said to his son: *"I bear the weight of the nation’s trust, always striving to serve. Yet I see the Emperor consult only fleeting words of the past, never long-term plans."*
Pointing to his grandson, he said: *"You shall surely suffer this fate."*
And when the Yongjia era came, Liu Cong and Liu Yao rebelled,
Both capturing Emperors Huai and Min.
Alas.
**Chapter 81: Trusting in One Truth Brings No Beauty**

The love of fine words brings no trust in the end,
Yet trustworthy words, though plain, benefit many.
*The Dao De Jing* says:
*"Trustworthy words are not fine,
Fine words are not trustworthy."*

A virtuous heart conceals its brilliance in true cultivation,
While eloquent tongues boast false skill—mere flattery alone.
*The Dao De Jing* says:
*"The virtuous do not argue,
Those who argue are not virtuous."*
Flattery is the speech of sycophants.

Simple and unadorned, they forget artifice—
Yet schemers twist nature, their empty rhetoric thin as silk.
The Master without guile surpasses the silver-tongued deceiver.

The Sage acts for the people’s benefit, returning to virtue.
*The Dao De Jing* says:
*"The Way of the Sage is to act without contention."*

Adjust the jade candle to harmonize all things.
Thus concludes the *Dao De Jing*—mysterious praises, Volume Two.
